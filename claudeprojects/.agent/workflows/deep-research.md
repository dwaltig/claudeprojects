# Deep Research Workflow

This workflow describes how to integrate Google's Deep Research agent (Gemini Advanced) into Buddhist translation and scholarly article work.

## Prerequisites

- **Google One AI Premium subscription** (~$20/month) for Gemini Advanced access
- Access to **gemini.google.com** on desktop
- Familiarity with query templates in `/docs/Deep_Research_Queries.md`

---

## Step 1: Identify Research Need

Determine the type of research required:

| Need Type | Query Template Section | Typical Duration |
|-----------|----------------------|------------------|
| Translation verification | Translation Verification | 10-15 min |
| Scholarly citation | Scholarly Article Research | 15-20 min |
| Historical context | Historical Context | 10-15 min |
| Blues idiom research | Blues Vernacular Research | 5-10 min |
| Science connections | Science-Buddhism Connections | 10-15 min |

---

## Step 2: Prepare the Query

1. Open `/docs/Deep_Research_Queries.md`
2. Find the appropriate query template for your need
3. Copy the template
4. Replace all `[BRACKETED PLACEHOLDERS]` with specific details:
   - Sutra name and chapter/verse numbers
   - Specific terms in original language
   - Translator names for comparison
   - Time period or tradition constraints

**Example Transformation:**

Template:
```
Research how major English translators have rendered [SPECIFIC TERM/PHRASE] 
from [SOURCE LANGUAGE] in [SUTRA NAME].
```

Customized:
```
Research how major English translators have rendered "入不二法門" 
(entering the dharma-gate of non-duality) from Classical Chinese 
in the Vimalakirti Sutra, Chapter 9.

Include analysis from Thurman, Watson, McRae, and Lamotte.
```

---

## Step 3: Submit to Deep Research

1. Navigate to **gemini.google.com**
2. Ensure you're logged into your Google One AI Premium account
3. Click the **Deep Research** button/option
4. Paste your customized query
5. Review the research plan that Gemini generates
6. Confirm to begin research (this takes 5-20 minutes)

---

## Step 4: Review and Export Results

While waiting (or after completion):

1. **Monitor progress** - Watch which sources Deep Research is consulting
2. **Review the report** - Check for:
   - Accuracy of sources
   - Relevance to your specific question
   - Any gaps or missing perspectives
3. **Export to Google Docs** - Click export option for permanent record
4. **Note key citations** - Copy specific page numbers and quotes

---

## Step 5: Log the Research

Open `/docs/Deep_Research_Log.md` and add a new entry:

1. Copy the entry template from the log file
2. Fill in all fields:
   - Date, project, query type
   - The exact query used
   - Key findings with sources
   - How findings will be incorporated
3. Update the monthly statistics table

---

## Step 6: Incorporate Findings

Based on research type, incorporate findings:

### For Translation Work:
- Update relevant chapter file with verified translation choice
- Add footnote citing scholarly consensus
- Note alternative translations in apparatus section

### For Scholarly Articles:
- Add citations to bibliography
- Update in-text references with page numbers
- Strengthen arguments with found sources

### For Blues Interpretation:
- Inform Bluesman persona with historical context
- Add authenticity to vernacular choices
- Document blues idiom origins

---

## Step 7: Cross-Reference

After incorporating findings:

1. Update any cross-references in other documents
2. Check if findings affect related passages/chapters
3. Note follow-up queries needed in the log
4. Consider if findings warrant additional research

---

## Quick Reference: Common Queries

### Verify a Translation Term
```
Research academic debates about translating "[TERM]" ([ORIGINAL]) 
in [TRADITION] Buddhism. Include major translator approaches and 
current scholarly consensus.
```

### Find Historical Context
```
Research the historical and cultural context of [ELEMENT/STORY] 
in [SUTRA], including Indian origins, Chinese transmission, and 
modern interpretive approaches.
```

### Literature Review for Article
```
Find peer-reviewed sources on [TOPIC] in Buddhist Studies, 
focusing on publications in Philosophy East and West, JIABS, 
and related journals from the last 15 years.
```

## Tips for Success

1. **Be patient** - Deep Research takes time but produces comprehensive results
2. **Verify citations** - Spot-check important sources before using
3. **Iterate queries** - Follow up on gaps in initial research
4. **Track everything** - The log becomes invaluable over time
5. **Cross-reference** - Check findings against trusted translations

---

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Research too broad | Add more specific constraints (dates, traditions, authors) |
| Missing key sources | Explicitly name journals or authors to include |
| Shallow analysis | Ask for "deep scholarly analysis" and "academic debates" |
| Wrong tradition | Specify Mahayana/Theravada/Vajrayana explicitly |
