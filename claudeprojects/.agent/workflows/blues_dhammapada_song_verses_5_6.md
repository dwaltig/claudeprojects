description: Create a Blues Dhammapada song for verses 5-6 using AI agents
---

## Workflow Steps

1. **Gather Source Verses**
   - Retrieve verses 5 and 6 from the Dhammapada source files (`Dhammapada_Pali_Chapter_1.txt`).
   - Use the **Scholarly Translation Agent** to obtain a literal English rendering (or use existing scholarly translation).

2. **Generate Blues Vernacular Lyrics**
   - Feed the literal translation to the **Blues Agent** to produce lyrical verses in a blues style, capturing the themes of "hatred ceasing by non-hatred" and "restraint".

3. **Structure the Song**
   - Use the **Songwriter Agent** to arrange the lyrics into a song format (e.g., Verse‑Chorus‑Bridge).
   - Define sections, repeat hooks, and any spoken interludes.

4. **Compose Music**
   - Invoke the **Music Composition Agent** to create a chord progression, melody, and basic arrangement suitable for a blues track (e.g., Slow Blues or Shuffle).
   - Output chord charts and production notes.

5. **Assemble Final Song Document**
   - Combine lyrics, chord symbols, and any audio generation commands into a single markdown file `Blues_Dhammapada_Song_Verses_5_6.md`.
   - Include metadata: title, author, timestamp, and agent credits.

6. **Review & Export**
   - Perform a manual review of the assembled song for lyrical flow, musical coherence, and correct diacritics.
   - Export the markdown to desired formats.

## Verification Plan
- **Manual Review**: Read through the final markdown to ensure verses 5‑6 are accurately represented and the blues style is consistent.
