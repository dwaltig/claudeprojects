Verification Report: "The Sacred Architecture of Twenty-Eight"
Confidence Score: 4/10 ⚠️ Needs Revision

Critical Issues Found
1. Pāli Dhammapada Description
Issue: The article needs to verify that Chapter 26 (Brāhmaṇavagga) has exactly 41 verses
Status: Claim appears correct, but should be double-checked against K.R. Norman
2. Gethin Citation (Line 349)
Issue: Potential attribution error — verify Gethin 1992 essay contents match claims about "mātikās"
Correction Needed: Confirm the essay is in In the Mirror of Memory and matches content cited
3. Abhidhamma Rūpa Claim
Issue: Should specify this is Theravāda Abhidhamma — Sarvāstivāda counts differ
Correction: Add qualifier "in Theravāda Abhidhamma"
4. Chan Patriarch Count
Issue: The 28-patriarch count varies between sources; some list 27, some 29
Correction: Qualify as "traditionally counted as 28" with note on variation
5. Hypothesis Qualification
Issue: Central thesis needs stronger acknowledgment of counter-evidence (Dhammapada's 26 chapters challenges "pan-Buddhist 28" claim)
Correction: Add "Limitations and Counterexamples" section
