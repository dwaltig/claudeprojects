[Verse 1]  
Got this spark inside my mind,  
Craving answers I can’t find.  
A fire burnin’ low and bright,  
Chasin’ shadows in the night.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Dreams collide in a fiery glow,  
Whispers come, then they go.  
Heart’s a beatin’ steady pace,  
Chasin’ thrills we can’t replace.  
  
[Chorus]  
Feel that surge takin’ hold,  
Cravin’ deep down in my soul.  
Ain’t no stoppin’ in this race,  
Through the blues, I find my place.  
  
[Verse 3]  
Mind’s on fire, hungry still,  
Breakin’ through by sheer will.  
Fuel these flames, let ’em rise,  
In the end, it’s no surprise.  
  
[Chorus]  
Feel that surge takin’ hold,  
Cravin’ deep down in my soul.  
Ain’t no stoppin’ in this race,  
Through the blues, I find my place.  
  
[Bridge]  
Cravin’ dreams just outta reach,  
Life’s a lesson, blues can teach.  
No denyin’ what’s inside—  
That spark’s there, just needs a guide.  
  
[Outro]  
Oh, I’m cravin’, yeah, I’m burnin’ slow,  
This fire’s all I need to know.  
Through the blues, I’ll find my way,  
Chasin’ light ’til break of day.
