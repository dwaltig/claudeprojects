# The Sun Don't Preach  
  
A raw, Delta blues track that wrestles with the difference between trying to fix a broken world with force and finding strength in a quieter, more patient wisdom. "The Sun Don't Preach" is a story told through a bottleneck slide and a steady foot stomp, contrasting the "power of a God" with the "wisdom of the Sun." It's a gritty, front-porch sermon about letting go of the hammer, trusting the process, and learning how to just shine.

**(A Delta Blues Song)**  
**Production Notes:**  
* **Style:** Raw, acoustic Delta blues. Think Son House or early Muddy Waters. The sound should be sparse, powerful, and deeply human.  
* **Instrumentation:**  
    * **Lead:** A single resonator guitar, played with a bottleneck slide. The slide should do a lot of the "singing," echoing the vocal lines and expressing the ache and the eventual clarity. The rhythm is a heavy, percussive thumb-stomp on the low strings.  
    * **Vocals:** Gritty, soulful, and full of conviction. The delivery should carry the weight of the first verses and the liberating insight of the chorus. It's a voice that has known frustration.  
    * **Rhythm:** A simple, steady foot stomp on a wooden floor. Nothing else is needed.  
* **Overall Feel:** This is a song born from a hard-won lesson. It should feel like a sermon delivered not from a pulpit, but from a rocking chair on a dusty porch as a storm gathers in the distance. The recording should be close-mic'd and intimate, capturing the scrape of the slide on the strings and the breath behind the words.  
  
**(Lyrics)**  
**(Music starts with a slow, heavy slide guitar riff. A single, steady foot stomp begins, like a heartbeat.)**  
  
(Verse 1)   
  
Tried to be a god, Lord, with a hammer in my hand   
Gonna beat this crooked world straight, across this broken land   
Tried to grab the thunder, tried to command the rain   
Swore I'd build a kingdom, and wash away the pain   
But the thunder, it just mocked me... and the hammer, it just fell   
Left me standin' in the silence of my own self-made hell.  
  
(Verse 2)   
I got down on my knees, Lord, and I prayed for holy fire   
To burn the wicked clean away, and lift the righteous higher   
I called for signs and wonders, for a voice to shake the stone   
To prove that I was chosen, and not standin' here alone   
But the fire, it never answered... and the stone, it never stirred   
Just the echo of my own angry, lonely word.  
  
(Chorus)   
(The guitar riff becomes a little brighter, more resolute. The slide holds a long, clear note.)   
  
And a whisper came like sunrise, through the darkness and the doubt   
Said, "Son, you got the meanin' of this whole thing twisted 'round."   
"It ain't the power of a God that's gonna see you through...   
It's the wisdom of the Sun, in everything you do."  
  
(Verse 3)   
'Cause the sun don't preach a sermon, don't choose who's right or wrong   
It just shines on down the valley, where the weary souls belong   
It don't force the seed to open, don't tell the roots to grow   
Just gives the light and warmth it has, patient and so slow   
And the life that's meant for livin'... finds its own way to the light   
Breaks the soil in its own time, with all its own true might.    
  
  
(Chorus)   
(Guitar and vocals build in quiet intensity.)   
Yeah, that whisper came like sunrise, through the darkness and the doubt   
Said, "Son, you got the meanin' of this whole thing twisted 'round."   
"It ain't the power of a God that's gonna see you through...   
It's the wisdom of the Sun, in everything you do."  
  
(Outro)   
(The foot stomp slows. The slide guitar plays a final, mournful but peaceful melody, letting the notes ring out.)   
  
Yeah, the wisdom of the sun...   
Don't have to force no one...   
Just shine...   
Just shine on...   
Mmm... shine on...  
  
**(The final slide note hangs in the air, then fades to silence.)**
