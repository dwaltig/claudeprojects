Lyrics:   
[Verse]  
They think the world’s aflame now  
End times calling tonight  
Eyes closed they see destruction  
But all’s serene in light  
  
[Verse 2]  
A peaceful realm ignored  
By minds so lost in fear  
While all around is quiet  
The truth is crystal clear  
  
[Chorus]  
In delusion they whisper  
The fire's bright and high  
But through the smoke of fiction  
The world is calm and dry  
  
[Verse 3]  
Great fires they imagine  
As cities crumble down  
Yet here in my own vision  
No flames to spread around  
  
[Verse 4]  
The kalpa’s end they rattle  
A tale that shakes the soul  
But here beneath the daylight  
Balance keeps control  
  
[Bridge]  
They see the end of days  
Through clouds of misbelief  
Yet all around a harmony  
Beyond the reach of grief  
  
Reprise:  
  
[Verse 2]  
A peaceful realm ignored  
By minds so lost in fear  
While all around is quiet  
The truth is crystal clear  
  
[Chorus]  
In delusion they whisper  
The fire's bright and high  
But through the smoke of fiction  
The world is calm and dry  
  
[Verse 3]  
Great fires they imagine  
As cities crumble down  
Yet here in my own vision  
The world is calm and dry  
The world is calm and dry  
  
[Chorus]  
In delusion they whisper  
The fire's bright and high  
But through the smoke of fiction  
The world is calm and dry  
  
[Verse 3]  
Great fires they imagine  
As cities crumble down  
Yet here in my own vision  
The world is calm and dry  
  
[Verse 3]  
Great fires they imagine  
As cities crumble down  
Yet here in my own vision  
The world is calm and dry  
  
The world is calm and dry  
  
The world is calm and dry  
  
[Verse 4]  
The kalpa’s end they rattle  
A tale that shakes the soul  
But here beneath the daylight  
Balance keeps control  
  
[Bridge]  
They see the end of days  
Through clouds of misbelief  
Yet all around a harmony  
Beyond the reach of grief
