# The Open Gate   
Inspired by a timeless spiritual paradox, "The Open Gate" is a blues-folk story that suggests the most profound truth isn't hidden away for the chosen few—it's accessible to everyone.  
  
Using the ancient parable of a loving father saving his children from a burning house, the song explores the idea that the greatest wisdom doesn't require immense skill or a lifetime of practice, but simply an open heart. With a soulful, acoustic groove, "The Open Gate" is a reminder that the path to peace is not a steep mountain to be climbed, but a door standing wide open for all.

* **Genre:** Acoustic Blues / Folk  
* **Tempo:** Mid-tempo, around 110 bpm, with a steady, soulful groove.

    * **Bass:** Upright bass, playing a simple, foundational line that walks through the chords.  
    * **Slide Guitar:** A dobro or resonator guitar playing gentle, melodic fills between vocal lines, adding a mournful but hopeful cry.  
    * **Percussion:** A brushed snare and a simple kick drum pattern. A tambourine comes in on the choruses to lift the energy.

**Lyrics**  
  
**(Intro - Acoustic guitar and a single, long slide guitar note)**  
  
(Verse 1)  
Some folks try to climb a mountain, thinkin' that's the only way  
Practice hard for countless ages, just to see a brighter day  
They believe you gotta be a scholar, or a saint of high degree  
That only the strongest souls can find the key to be set free  
And for them, that road is true, but it's a hard and lonely state  
It takes a will of iron just to get past the first gate  
  
(Chorus)  
But the Teacher, in his wisdom, he turned it all around  
Said the truest, deepest teaching is for the lowest ground  
Some paths say you must be worthy, before you even start  
But the real Truth is a river, for every broken heart  
It don't depend on your own power, your wisdom or your might  
It's the power of the Love itself that brings the darkness into light  
  
(Verse 2)  
They tell a story 'bout a Father, watchin' his whole house burn down  
His children played inside with toys, the most distracted kids in town  
He called out, "I've got precious treasures, wonders to behold!"  
A loving lure to save them from that ruin, weak and old.  
But he didn't give those separate gifts, when they were safe and near,   
He gave them one great open road, and put an end to all their fear.  
  
(Chorus)  
'Cause the Teacher, in his wisdom, he turned it all around  
Said the truest, deepest teaching is for the lowest ground  
Some paths say you must be worthy, before you even start  
But the real Truth is a river, for every broken heart  
It don't depend on your own power, your wisdom or your might  
It's the power of Love itself that brings darkness into light  
  
(Bridge)  
In these modern, troubled days, the world is full of strife  
The old maps are all faded, they've lost the power for this life  
So you don't need a grand cathedral, don't need a scholar's mind  
The only thing that's asked of you is the faith that you can find  
Just a simple act of trust, a whispered prayer or tune  
To awaken that bright Spirit, that's been sleeping in the gloom  
  
(Outro)  
Yeah, the gate is standin' open, for the sinner and the saint  
For the fisherman's child, the warrior, for the weary and the faint  
The truest teaching... is for the lowest stage...  
  
(Acoustic guitar fingerpicking fades out with a final, hopeful slide guitar phrase)
