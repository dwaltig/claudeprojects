## 📜 Source Text (Dhammapada 1-2)

**Verse 1:**
> Mind is the forerunner of all actions.
> All deeds are led by mind, created by mind.
> If one speaks or acts with a corrupt mind,
> suffering follows as the wheel follows the hoof of the ox.

**Verse 2:**
> Mind is the forerunner of all actions.
> All deeds are led by mind, created by mind.
> If one speaks or acts with a pure mind,
> happiness follows like a shadow that never leaves.
