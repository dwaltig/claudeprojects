**Verse 1**   
In the stillness of dawn,   
I find my refuge deep   
Not on some mountain high,   
nor where the wild winds sweep   
But in this beating heart,   
where all the worlds reside   
Beyond the highest peak,   
it's here I safely hide  
  
**Chorus**   
Oh, the arrows may fly,   
darkness may bend and break   
But the just stand tall,   
for truth's own sake   
Foundations may crumble,   
the world may fall apart   
But the wise one walks on,   
with a steady, peaceful heart  
  
**Verse 2**   
In every soul's chamber,   
there's an awakening light   
Shining through the sorrow,   
burning ever bright   
Not a light to run from,   
but one that opens wide   
Seeing through the illusions,   
casting fear aside  
  
**Chorus**   
Oh, the arrows may fly,   
darkness may bend and break   
But the just stand tall,   
for truth's own sake   
Foundations may crumble,   
the world may fall apart   
But the wise one walks on,   
with a steady, peaceful heart  
  
**Bridge**   
From the heavens above,   
Compassion's eyes do see   
Through the veil of sadness,   
our tears He wipes gently   
Not with judgment's weight,   
but with wisdom's warm embrace   
For each soul's a mirror,   
reflecting His holy face  
  
**Verse 3**   
Those who play with fire,   
lost in storm and rage   
Build themselves a prison,   
trapped within their cage   
But mercy's wind will blow,   
tearing those bars away   
Even the cruelest heart   
can find a brighter day  
  
**Chorus**   
Oh, the arrows may fly,   
darkness may bend and break   
But the just stand tall,   
for truth's own sake   
Foundations may crumble,   
the world may fall apart   
But the wise one walks on,   
with a steady, peaceful heart  
  
**Outro**   
So find your refuge,   
not in flight,   
but in deep peace   
Where the heart's quiet song   
brings a sweet release   
For the Lord is awakened,   
in every soul He dwells   
And in every act of justice,   
His truth forever swells
