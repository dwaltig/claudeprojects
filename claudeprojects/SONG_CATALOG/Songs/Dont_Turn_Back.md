## 🎤 YouTube Description

> "Don't Turn Back" is a soulful folk blues song inspired by the Magic City Parable from the Lotus Sutra. Through tender acoustic guitar, heartfelt vocals, and gentle slide guitar, this spiritual ballad reflects on the human journey — resting places along the way, the pull of comfort, and the urging to keep going toward true treasures: wisdom, compassion, and awakening.
