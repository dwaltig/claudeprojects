## Featured Track

### The Illusion of Fire
**52,900 plays** — The breakout hit

*"They think the world's aflame now / End times calling tonight / Eyes closed they see destruction / But all's serene in light"*

Based on Chapter 16's teaching that the world is not actually burning—the flames are an illusion born of deluded perception. The Buddha's pure land is right here.

## Album Notes

These songs translate the 28 chapters of the Lotus Sutra into Blues, Folk, and Gospel traditions. The sutra's core teachings—universal Buddhahood, skillful means, the eternal presence of wisdom—find new life in the language of struggle, survival, and transcendence.

Each track maintains doctrinal accuracy while making ancient wisdom accessible to modern ears.
