🎶 ALBUM ANNOUNCEMENT 🎶

I'm thrilled to share "Dhammapada Blues - Chapter 1" by The William Altig Choir!

This album brings the Buddha's opening chapter of the Dhammapada—the Yamakavagga (Twin Verses)—into the language of the Blues using an innovative agent-based translation methodology. Each contrasting pair of verses (good/evil, wise/foolish, suffering/liberation) becomes a song.

**9 tracks. 18 verses. One ancient truth.**

**About the Process:** The songs were created using creative AI personas—Sister Ray Johnson (the Blues interpreter) and Master John Kim (the scholarly reviewer)—as part of my research on vernacular Buddhist translation. All music generated via Suno AI.

The Dhammapada has been teaching wisdom for 2,500 years. The Blues has been teaching it for centuries. This album brings them together.

Styles range from Soul Blues to Gospel Blues to Delta Blues—all performed by Sister Ray Johnson and The William Altig Choir.

I'm pleased to announce the release of "Dhammapada Blues - Chapter 1," an experimental album that interprets the Buddha's opening chapter of the Dhammapada through African-American Blues tradition.

This project represents the intersection of my scholarly work on vernacular Buddhist translation and practical application through music. The 9-track vinyl LP translates verses 1-18 (Yamakavagga - Twin Verses) into Soul Blues, Gospel Blues, and Delta Blues.

The methodology: let the dharma speak through a musical tradition that also understands suffering and liberation. No religious attribution in the lyrics—just timeless wisdom in a contemporary vernacular.

This album complements my academic work on Blues epistemology and Buddhist translation theory, currently under peer review at several journals.

**Subject:** New Album: Dhammapada Blues - Chapter 1

Dear Friends,

I'm excited to share my first full album: **"Dhammapada Blues - Chapter 1"** by The William Altig Choir.

This album brings the Buddha's Dhammapada—one of Buddhism's most beloved texts—into the language of the Blues. The opening chapter, the Yamakavagga (Twin Verses), presents teachings in contrasting pairs: good and evil, wise and foolish, suffering and liberation.

Each pair becomes a song.

**10 tracks. 20 verses. One ancient truth.**

The music ranges from Soul Blues to Gospel Blues to Delta Blues, all performed by Sister Ray Johnson and The William Altig Choir. The lyrics let the dharma speak for itself—no Buddha references, just timeless wisdom in a contemporary vernacular.

**📖 Read the full Dhammapada Reborn (text + audio):**  
https://elevenreader.io/audiobooks/the-dhammapada-reborn/R99T1NtJw5NJozhvIYZk

**About the Format:** This is a **physical LP (vinyl)** available through ElasticStage's on-demand manufacturing platform.

**About the Methodology:** This project uses agent-based creative personas (Sister Ray Johnson, Master John Kim) as heteronyms—distinct artistic voices that embody specific cultural and aesthetic perspectives. Like Fernando Pessoa's literary heteronyms, these personas represent real methodological approaches to Buddhist vernacular translation. All music is AI-generated (Suno), with lyrics created through multi-agent collaboration (Claude).

This album is part of my larger "Dharma Reborn" project, which includes scholarly translations and vernacular interpretations of Buddhist sutras. The methodology is simple: the Blues and the dharma both understand suffering and freedom. Let them speak together on vinyl.

I hope you enjoy listening as much as I enjoyed creating it.

With gratitude,  
William Altig

**"Dhammapada Blues - Chapter 1" Released by The William Altig Choir**  
*Ancient Buddhist Wisdom Meets African-American Blues Tradition*

**Houston, TX – December 24, 2025** – Independent scholar and musician William Altig has released "Dhammapada Blues - Chapter 1," a 10-track album that interprets the Buddha's Dhammapada through Soul Blues, Gospel Blues, and Delta Blues.

The Dhammapada is one of Buddhism's most widely-read texts, containing 423 verses of ethical and philosophical teachings. This album focuses on the opening chapter—the Yamakavagga (Twin Verses)—which presents the Buddha's teachings in contrasting pairs: good and evil, wise and foolish, suffering and liberation.

Using an innovative agent-based methodology, Altig created the album through creative AI personas (Sister Ray Johnson as the Blues interpreter, Master John Kim as scholarly reviewer) that function as heteronyms—distinct artistic voices embodying specific cultural perspectives. The music was generated via Suno AI.

"The Blues and the dharma both know suffering, and both know liberation," says Altig. "This album lets them speak together through a multi-agent translation system that preserves both theological precision and Blues authenticity. The personas aren't deception—they're methodology."

The album is part of Altig's larger "Dharma Reborn" project, which includes scholarly translations published on ElevenReader and academic articles on Blues epistemology and vernacular translation currently under peer review at several Buddhist studies journals.

## 💬 Sample Responses to Comments/Questions

**Q: "Is this actual Buddhist music or just inspired by it?"**
A: "This is a direct translation of the Buddha's Dhammapada into Blues vernacular. Each song interprets a pair of verses from the original Pali text. It's both—actual Buddhist teachings AND authentic Blues music."

**Q: "What's the deal with Sister Ray Johnson?"**
A: "Sister Ray Johnson is a creative heteronym—like Fernando Pessoa's distinct literary voices. She represents the Blues interpreter methodology in my agent-based translation system. It's not deception; it's a transparent methodological approach to vernacular translation. All AI tools are fully disclosed."

**Q: "Is this AI-generated?"**
A: "Yes, with full transparency: lyrics created through multi-agent AI collaboration (Claude), music generated via Suno AI. The creative personas (Sister Ray Johnson, Master John Kim) function as heteronyms—distinct artistic voices that embody specific cultural and scholarly perspectives. This is part of my research on agent-based vernacular translation."

**Q: "What's next?"**
A: "Chapter 2! The Dhammapada has 26 chapters. We're also working on a Lotus Sutra album."

**Q: "Can I use this for meditation?"**
A: "Absolutely. Many of these songs work beautifully as contemplative listening. 'Stand Like a Mountain' and 'Mind Writes the First Verse' are particularly meditative."

**Q: "Is this research-based?"**
A: "Yes—this album is part of my larger scholarly project on Blues epistemology and vernacular Buddhist translation. I have several peer-reviewed articles on this methodology currently under review at academic journals (Contemporary Buddhism, Journal of Africana Religions, JPTS, etc.)."
