## Album Notes

The Buddha's Dhammapada has been teaching wisdom for 2,500 years. This album translates its opening chapter into the language of the Blues—music that also knows suffering and also knows freedom.

**No Buddha references in lyrics**—the truth speaks for itself.

## About the Process

Sister Ray Johnson is a creative heteronym developed by William Altig to embody the Blues vernacular translation methodology. Like Fernando Pessoa's distinct literary voices, Sister Ray represents a specific aesthetic and cultural lens—the intersection of Buddhist wisdom and African-American Blues tradition. All songs are created using agent-based AI collaboration, with Sister Ray serving as the blues interpreter persona.
