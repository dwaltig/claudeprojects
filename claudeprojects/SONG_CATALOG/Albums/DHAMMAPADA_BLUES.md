## 📜 About the Yamakavagga

The "Twin Verses" (Yamakavagga) form the opening chapter of the Dhammapada. They present core Buddhist teachings in contrasting pairs:

- Good vs. evil outcomes
- Pure mind vs. corrupt mind
- Wise vs. foolish behavior
- Hatred vs. non-hatred

Each song interprets two verses through blues and folk music.
