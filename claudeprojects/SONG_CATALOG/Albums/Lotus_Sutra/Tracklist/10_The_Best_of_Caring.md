# Track 10: The Best of Caring
## Chapter 2: Skillful Means

### Description
A slow, intimate Soul-Blues confession from a Teacher who's seen too much to lie.

It's a song about the burden and the beauty of deep, tailored care.

### Lyrics

[Intro - Warm, muted electric piano. A single, soft brush on a snare drum.]

[Verse 1]
I sat beneath that tree so long, the stars got old and grey
I saw a truth so wide and deep, there wasn't words to say
I almost just stayed silent, let the world go stumblin' on
But then I looked into your eyes... and I knew I had to write this song.
See, you were lost out in the thicket, you were drowning in the flood
You didn't need a sermon, child... you needed flesh and blood.

[Verse 2]
So I told you 'bout the narrow road, I told you 'bout the wide
I told you 'bout the climb and the stumble and the fall
I met you where you were hurtin', met you where you cried
Gave you different medicines... but they were comin' from the same well, after all.
Every story was a doorway, every path led to one room
I was just tryin' to get you home... before the final boom.

[Chorus]
It's the best of caring... (The best of caring)
It's the oldest kind of love... (Oldest kind of love)
A thousand different stories... but one truth from above
I didn't come to make you small, didn't come to make you crawl
I came to show you somethin', child... you were already standing tall.
One Vehicle... one road home... one great reason for it all.

[Verse 3]
Five thousand walked away that day, thought they already knew
They had their little victories, their comfortable half-truths
But for you who stayed to listen, for you who felt the ache
I'm gonna tell you somethin' now... for your own sweet sake:
If a child draws a circle in the dirt with a stick
They've already started walkin'... every little move's a trick.

[Bridge - Spoken/Sung, Raw and Intimate]
You see these different gates? ...They all lead to the same house.
You see these different songs? ...They all got the same mouth.
The Hearers and the Solitary Ones, the Bodhisattvas in the back...
They're all on the same highway, child, just different parts of the track.
One Great Reason... that's why I'm here.
To open up your eyes... and drive away your fear.

[Guitar Solo - Muted, weeping blues guitar. Let the silence breathe.]

[Chorus]
It's the best of caring... (The best of caring)
It's the oldest kind of love... (Oldest kind of love)
A thousand different stories... but one truth from above
I didn't come to make you small, didn't come to make you crawl
I came to show you somethin', child... you were already standing tall.
One Vehicle... one road home... one great reason for it all.

[Outro]
Just one road... (Just one road)
Just one reason... (One great reason)
Every season... (Every season)
Leads you home.
[Soft fade with piano and distant choir hum]
The best of caring...
Amen.
[End]
