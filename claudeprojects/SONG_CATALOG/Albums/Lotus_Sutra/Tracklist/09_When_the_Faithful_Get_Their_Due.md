Two figures—a tired older man clutching a worn leather book, and a young boy with dirt on his hands—stand at the back of the congregation as a single beam of golden light breaks through a high window and lands on them. Everyone else is turned around, looking at them for the first time. No text.

### Lyrics

[Intro - Heavy, mournful slide guitar. Single foot stomp keeping time.]

[Verse 1]
Been standing in the back, Lord, for more years than I can count
Held every single word safe, every lesson, every doubt
My name is Ānanda, I was the keeper of the rain
Every drop of wisdom fell on me, and I caught every grain
But when the glory came around, when the crowns were handed down
I was still there in the corner, just watching from the ground.

[Chorus]
But my time is comin'... (My time is comin')
Can you feel it in the air? (Feel it in the air)
When the faithful get their due, Lord, gonna lay down this despair
I held the Dharma like a mama holds her only child
Been patient, been forgotten, been traveling through the wild
But the Teacher finally saw me... He called out my name
And my cup is overflowing... I ain't never been the same.

[Verse 2]
And there was Rāhula, the quiet son, the blood of flesh and bone
He practiced in the secret, Lord, he did his work alone
He didn't ask for glory, didn't need a single light
He just walked his path in silence, in the middle of the night
But a father knows his children, sees the labor in their eyes
And he called him to the table, underneath the open skies.

[Chorus]
Our time is comin'... (Our time is comin')
Can you feel it in the air? (Feel it in the air)
When the faithful get their due, Lord, gonna lay down this despair
We held the Dharma like a mama holds her only child
Been patient, been forgotten, been traveling through the wild
But the Teacher finally saw us... He called out our names
And our cup is overflowing... We ain't never been the same.

[Bridge - Spoken/Sung, Rawer]
Two thousand more in the shadows... slipping their robes off their shoulders
Showing their scars, showing their service, showing their years
They were the learners and the learned, the ones who stayed behind
And they all got the same promise... they all got the same sign:
One name... one throne... one destiny...
'Cause in the eyes of Truth, child... ain't no one less than me.

[Guitar Solo - Slow, weeping slide guitar. Let it breathe.]

[Chorus]
Yeah, our time is comin'... (Our time is comin')
Can you feel it in the air? (Feel it in the air)
When the faithful get their due, Lord, gonna lay down this despair
We held the Dharma like a mama holds her only child
Been patient, been forgotten, been traveling through the wild
But the Teacher finally saw us... He called out our names
And our cup is overflowing... We ain't never been the same.

[Outro]
Mountain-Sea-Wisdom... (That's my name now)
Stepping-on-Seven-Jewel-Flowers... (That's his crown)
Jewel-Mark for all the rest... (All the same)
Our cup is overflowing...
Like sweet dew on the brim...
[Choir fades with humming and foot stomps]
Amen.
[End]
