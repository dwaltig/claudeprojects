### Lyrics

[Verse 1]
They think the world’s aflame now
End times calling tonight
Eyes closed they see destruction
But all’s serene in light

[Verse 2]
A peaceful realm ignored
By minds so lost in fear
While all around is quiet
The truth is crystal clear

[Chorus]
In delusion they whisper
The fire's bright and high
But through the smoke of fiction
The world is calm and dry

[Verse 3]
Great fires they imagine
As cities crumble down
Yet here in my own vision
No flames to spread around

[Verse 4]
The kalpa’s end they rattle
A tale that shakes the soul
But here beneath the daylight
Balance keeps control

[Bridge]
They see the end of days
Through clouds of misbelief
Yet all around a harmony
Beyond the reach of grief

[Chorus]
In delusion they whisper
The fire's bright and high
But through the smoke of fiction
The world is calm and dry

[Outro]
The world is calm and dry
Balance keeps control
Beyond the reach of grief
The truth is crystal clear
[Fade out]
