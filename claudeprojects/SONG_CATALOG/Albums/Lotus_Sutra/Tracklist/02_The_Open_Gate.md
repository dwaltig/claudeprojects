### Lyrics

[Intro - Acoustic guitar and a single, long slide guitar note]

[Verse 1]
Some folks try to climb a mountain, thinkin' that's the only way
Practice hard for countless ages, just to see a brighter day
They believe you gotta be a scholar, or a saint of high degree
That only the strongest souls can find the key to be set free
And for them, that road is true, but it's a hard and lonely state
It takes a will of iron just to get past the first gate

[Chorus]
But the Teacher, in his wisdom, he turned it all around
Said the truest, deepest teaching is for the lowest ground
Some paths say you must be worthy, before you even start
But the real Truth is a river, for every broken heart
It don't depend on your own power, your wisdom or your might
It's the power of the Love itself that brings the darkness into light

[Verse 2]
They tell a story 'bout a Father, watchin' his whole house burn down
His children played inside with toys, the most distracted kids in town
He called out, "I've got precious treasures, wonders to behold!"
A loving lure to save them from that ruin, weak and old.
But he didn't give those separate gifts, when they were safe and near, 
He gave them one great open road, and put an end to all their fear.

[Chorus]
'Cause the Teacher, in his wisdom, he turned it all around
Said the truest, deepest teaching is for the lowest ground
Some paths say you must be worthy, before you even start
But the real Truth is a river, for every broken heart
It don't depend on your own power, your wisdom or your might
It's the power of Love itself that brings darkness into light

[Bridge]
In these modern, troubled days, the world is full of strife
The old maps are all faded, they've lost the power for this life
So you don't need a grand cathedral, don't need a scholar's mind
The only thing that's asked of you is the faith that you can find
Just a simple act of trust, a whispered prayer or tune
To awaken that bright Spirit, that's been sleeping in the gloom

[Outro]
Yeah, the gate is standin' open, for the sinner and the saint
For the fisherman's child, the warrior, for the weary and the faint
The truest teaching... is for the lowest stage...

[Acoustic guitar fingerpicking fades out with a final, hopeful slide guitar phrase]
