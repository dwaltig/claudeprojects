### Lyrics

[Intro]

[Verse 1]
In the deep sea waters, 
In the deep sea waters, 
In the deep sea waters, where the dragons roam,
A young girl stood, far from her home.
They said she couldn’t, no way she’d see,
The light of truth, the Buddha’s decree.

[Chorus]
But actions speak louder than words, oh, they do,
She showed the world what’s deep and true.
With a heart of gold and a priceless gem,
She found the light, and she showed it to them.

[Verse 2]
Mañjuśrī knew, she had the grace,
But the wise ones doubted, they couldn’t embrace.
How could a child, just eight years old,
Hold the key to wisdom’s fold?

[Chorus]
But actions speak louder than words, oh, they do,
She showed the world what’s deep and true.
With a heart of gold and a priceless gem,
She found the light, and she showed it to them.
And she showed it to them.

[Instrumental]

[Bridge]
She offered her gem, with reverence so bright,
And in that moment, she found her light.
Transformed before their very eyes,
She rose above, touched the skies.

[Verse 3]
Now the world shook, the truth was clear,
No more doubt, no more fear.
The Dragon King’s daughter, so pure, so wise,
Reached enlightenment, to everyone’s surprise.

[Chorus]
Because actions speak louder than words, oh, they do,
She showed the world what’s deep and true.
With a heart of gold and a priceless gem,
She found the light, and she showed it to them.

[Outro]
So when you’re doubted, when you’re told you can’t,
Remember her story, take a stand.
For actions speak louder, yes, it’s true,
Just like that girl, the Buddha in you.
The Buddha in you.
[End]
