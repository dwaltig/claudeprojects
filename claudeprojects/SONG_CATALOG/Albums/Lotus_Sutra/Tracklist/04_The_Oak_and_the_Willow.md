### Lyrics

[Verse 1]
In a green valley, 
'neath sun's warm embrace, 
Two trees stood tall, 
each in its own space. 
The oak, strong and proud, 
roots deep and wide, 
The willow, gentle, 
swayed with the tide.

[Chorus]
Oh, the oak and the willow, 
a story to tell, 
Of choices we make, 
where destinies dwell. 
Roots in the earth, 
reaching for the sky, 
In the storms of life, 
some will fall, 
some will fly.

[Verse 2]
A tempest brewed, 
dark clouds filled the air, 
The wind howled fierce, 
a challenge to bear. 
The oak held fast, 
its branches did sway, 
But the willow, alas, 
was swept away.

[Bridge]
The oak still stands, 
though weathered and worn, 
A symbol of strength, 
a lesson reborn. 
The willow is gone, 
a memory's trace, 
A reminder to seek a firm, 
lasting place.

[Chorus]
Oh, the oak and the willow, 
a story to tell, 
Of choices we make, 
where destinies dwell. 
Roots in the earth, 
reaching for the sky, 
In the storms of life, 
some will fall, 
some will fly.

[Outro]
So plant your roots deep, 
in the fertile soil, 
Let wisdom and faith 
guide your heart and toil. 
When the winds of change blow, 
you'll stand strong and true, 
Reaching for the heavens, 
bathed in endless blue.
