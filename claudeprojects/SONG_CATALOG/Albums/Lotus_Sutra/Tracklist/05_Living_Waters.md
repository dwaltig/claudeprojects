# Track 5: Living Waters
## Chapter 10: The Teacher of the Law

### Description
A blues-folk meditation on the exhaustion of trying to earn your worth through endless striving.

Inspired by the "Digging for Water" parable.

- **Artwork Brief:** A dramatic, low-angle shot of a person's muddied boots standing on cracked, dry earth. In one hand, they hold a worn wooden shovel planted firmly in the ground.

### Lyrics

[INTRO]
(Sparse fingerpicked guitar or solo harmonica, setting a dusty, contemplative mood. Let it breathe for 8-12 bars.)

[VERSE 1]
I woke up this morning, 
climbed the highest hill, 
tried to make it right.
Dug every garden, 
gave my neighbor water, 
waited for a sign of light.
I hauled stone and timber, 
built a fire to keep folks warm,
But when the long shadows stretched and the day was gone, 
I was empty, soaked, and worn.

I found my kindness was just a mirror, 
cracked and gray,
Tryin’ to light my own damn house with the fire I gave away.

Yeah, I worked all day long, but when the moon rose high—
My spirit still wasn’t satisfied.

[CHORUS]
My hands are calloused, 
but my prayers taste like a lie,
I’m standin’ in the dust, 
watchin’ every good deed drift on by.
My giving was hollow, 
hidin’ what I hoped to get,
I’m drownin’ in my own well-meaning, 
and the shore ain’t found me yet.

Practice ain’t enough, Lord—
I need the truth I can’t achieve,
I need the word that saves me from the man I thought I had to be.

[VERSE 2]
I tried to pull the world up clean from the mud,
But the weight of their sorrow mixed in with my blood.
My high aspirations sank down in the mire,
My water turned bitter—
I forgot the true fire.

(Long rest)

I fell by the roadside, 
cold dread in my chest,
When a stranger laid a parchment right upon my weary chest.

He said: “You been tryin’ to earn the daylight, 
climbin’ in the dark,
The wellspring you been diggin’ for’s already in your heart.
Now close your weary eyes, child—
let these words carry you home.”

[CHORUS (REPRISE)]
My hands are calloused, 
but my prayers don’t taste like lies,
I’m standin’ in the dust, 
watchin’ grace come rollin’ by.
My giving was hollow once, 
hidin’ what I hoped to get,
But I’m drinkin’ from that same well now—
and I ain’t drownin’ yet.
Practice ain’t enough, Lord—
but faith is what I see,
I found the word that saves me from the man I tried to be.

[BRIDGE]
Then a whisper cut through the drought,
Said, “The gold you’re diggin’ for—
it’s what you’re made of, child, no doubt.”
You been pullin' on a door that never was locked,
Bleedin’ for the light when it’s burnin’ inside.

The fire was in the wood all along,
The song was in your skin.
The debt was paid before your birth—
You just gotta let the mercy in.

[OUTRO]
You don’t gotta carry nothin’, 
just lay your shovel down and sigh.
The worth you were lookin’ for, child, 
was shinin’ in your own eye.
You don’t gotta earn the grace—
just stand still and breathe.

I climbed that high hill, 
but now I sit down flat,
And the quiet that holds me deep—
is the peace I chased at last.
I stopped the striving, let the light just stay—
I walked out of my own shame today.

(Whispered)
“No more... cold dread..."
(Mantra[Big Gospel finish with Choir]
Mud is the sign!
Amen.
[End]
