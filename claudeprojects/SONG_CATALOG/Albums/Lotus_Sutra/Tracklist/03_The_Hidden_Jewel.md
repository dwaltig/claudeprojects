- **Artwork Brief:** A close-up of a tattered, dusty traveler's cloak. One corner of the hem is slighty torn, revealing the brilliant, multi-colored sparkle of a large diamond sewn inside the lining. The background is a dim, moonlit street. The contrast between the dirty fabric and the radiant jewel is sharp and mystical. No text.

### Lyrics

[Verse 1]
There's an old tale, passed down through time 
Of a hidden treasure, a truth sublime 
A man in need, a friend's kind deed 
A jewel concealed, a soul in need

[Verse 2]
So listen close, to the words I sing 
Of the hidden jewel, that life can bring 
May it awaken, a spark in your soul 
And lead you onward, to your goal

[Verse 3]
Lost and weary, on life's rough road 
He sought shelter, a heavy load 
A friend welcomed, with open hand 
Shared warmth and comfort, in this strange land

[Verse 4]
As slumber claimed him, deep and sound 
His friend's kind hands moved without sound
A jewel sewn in, with loving care 
Into his cloak, a treasure rare

[Chorus]
Oh, the hidden jewel, deep inside 
Covered in dust, where dreams reside 
Unaware of the wealth he possessed 
In tattered clothes, his soul undressed

[Verse 5]
He drifted on, through streets unknown 
A heavy heart, a spirit forlorn
The jewel lay hidden, its worth untold 
A forgotten treasure, in the night's cold

[Chorus]
Oh, the hidden jewel, deep inside 
Covered in dust, where dreams reside 
Unaware of the wealth he possessed 
In tattered clothes, his soul undressed

[Bridge]
A chance encounter, years later still
The friend's words pierced like a healing pill
"Remember that night? I sewed it there,
The jewel in your cloak, beyond compare"

[Verse 6]
Eyes wide open, the truth unfurled
A wealth untold, a brand new world
The hidden treasure, at last revealed
A life of riches, no longer concealed

[Chorus]
Oh, the hidden jewel, deep inside 
Covered in dust, where dreams reside 
Awakened now, his true worth confessed 
In shining light, his soul blessed

[Outro]
So let us search within our own hearts 
For the hidden jewel, that sets us apart 
May we awaken to the light within 
And find the treasure where true joy begins
