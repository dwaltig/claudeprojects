# Track 6: The Conjured City Blues
## Chapter 7: The Parable of the Phantom City

### Description
A soulful fusion of ancient Buddhist wisdom and the raw emotional power of the Blues. Inspired by Chapter Seven of the Lotus Sutra, the song journeys through the vastness of suffering, perseverance, and hope. It captures the struggle of beings trapped in the “prison of the triple world” and the skillful means of the Conjured City—a place of rest on the long road to enlightenment.

### Lyrics

[Intro - A slow, haunting melody rooted in minor blues traditions. Delta-style slide guitar.]

[Verse 1]
I’ve been walkin’ through the prison,
The triple world’s heavy chains,
Long ages lost in shadow,
Where the suffering remains.

The heavens cry, the Brahma Kings sigh,
They pray the Dharma wheel to spin,
Turn that light to break the night,
Let the healing song begin.

[Chorus]
Oh, the road is long, the journey slow,
Five hundred yojanas down below,
Through phantom cities made of dreams,
We’re chasin’ truths behind the seams.

[Verse 2]
Great-Universal-Wisdom sat so still,
Ten aeons passed ‘fore light could fill,
Conquered Mara, fought the fight,
But the dawn came slow that night.

We stumble through illusions deep,
Earthly desires that haunt our sleep,
Yet in the darkest, there’s a vow,
To raise us up and show us how.

[Chorus]
Oh, the road is long, the journey slow,
Five hundred yojanas down below,
Through phantom cities made of dreams,
We’re chasin’ truths behind the seams.

[Bridge]
The vow’s not just for me or you,
It’s for all beings, pure and true,
May merit shine and wisdom flow,
Till every heart begins to glow.

[Chorus]
Oh, the road is long, the journey slow,
Five hundred yojanas down below,
Through phantom cities made of dreams,
We’re chasin’ truths behind the seams.

[Outro]
So sing the Blues of cosmic pain,
Of hope and loss and sacred gain,
The Buddha’s light, a distant star,
Guidin’ souls from near and far.
[End]
