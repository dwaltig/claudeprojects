# Track 8: The Treasure Tower
## Chapter 11: The Appearance of the Treasure Tower

### Description
A soulful / folk-blues ballad recorded like a sacred field ceremony—intimate, haunted, then vast. The voice is *The Witness*: trembling, close-miked, raw, barely holding it together. It captures the moment the great Stūpa arose from the earth, and the revelation of the Buddha seated within, inviting us to see the "Treasure Tower" in our own lives.

- **Artwork Brief:** A colossal, ancient stone stūpa (Treasure Tower) made of dark basalt and glowing gold, rising dramatically out of a sun-scorched, dusty desert floor.

A sense of immense scale and ancient power. No text.

### Lyrics

[VERSE 1]
(Am) Vulture Peak was hot... (G) just dust and bone. 
(C) We were listenin' to the Preacher, (F) felt so far from home. 
(Am) He was talkin' 'bout a "One Way," (G) but my back was tired and sore... 
(F) Just a thousand hungry faces, (E) waitin' for something more. 
(Am) Just... waitin'.

[VERSE 2]
(Am) Then the ground beneath us... (G) began to *move* and *sway*. 
(C) It wasn't anger, it wasn't breakin', (F) it was a sacred, holy play. 
(Am) It danced with divine energy, (G) it tossed from end to end, 
(F) And a wave of awe and gladness (E) washed right over every friend. 
(Am) We felt... this... joy...

[CHORUS]
(C) Oh, the Treasure Tower... (G) from the **dancing ground.** 
(Am) The chimin' of its jeweled bells, (F) was the **sweetest, truest sound.** 
(C) It’s the truth we all were born with, (G) but we never knew we had. 
(F) It’s the Buddha in the sinner, (E) and the good inside the bad. 
(Am) My own... Treasure Tower.

[VERSE 3]
(Am) The door, it swung wide open... (G) no creak of wood or steel. 
(C) And an ancient, long-gone Buddha, (F) suddenly was real. 
(Am) He was the Ghost of all our ages, (G) the face of timeless law. 
(F) And our Preacher, our Shakyamuni, (E) sat beside him, and we saw... 
(Am) We just... saw.

[VERSE 4]
(Am) We saw the Mirror and the Face, Lord, (G) the Ocean and the Rain. 
(C) The Truth that never changes, (F) and the man who feels the pain. 
(Am) And the ancient one made space... (G) on that single, shinin' throne. 
(F) And they sat as one together, (E) flesh and spirit, seed and stone. 
(Am) Lord... seed and stone.

[CHORUS]
(C) Oh, the Treasure Tower... (G) from the **dancing ground.** 
(Am) The chimin' of its jeweled bells, (F) was the **sweetest, truest sound.** 
(C) It’s the truth we all were born with, (G) but we never knew we had. 
(F) It’s the Buddha in the sinner, (E) and the good inside the bad. 
(Am) My own... Treasure Tower.

[BRIDGE]
(F) Then the air began to shimmer, (C) and our feet forgot the dust. 
(G) He raised us all together, (Am) in his mercy, in his trust. 
(F) No high, no low, no "other," (C) no "smarter," no "too late." 
(G) Just a million souls suspended... (E) breathing open at the gate. 
(E) Just... breathing.

[VERSE 5]
(Am) The Preacher looked right at us... (G) his voice was soft and clear. 
(C) "This Tower is my body... (F) and it’s why I brought you here." 
(Am) "Now, who will hold this teaching? (G) Who will carry it back down?" 
(F) "This heavy, breakin' glory... (E) in the middle of the town?" 
(Am) "Who... will go?"

[OUTRO]
(C) Oh, the Treasure Tower... (G) ain't no story from the past. 
(Am) It’s the promise in your own life, (F) the only thing that lasts. 
(C) It’s the hands that build and suffer, (G) it's the heart that knows it's true... 
(F) This Treasure Tower, brother... (E) it is you. 
(Am) It is you... (G) ...it is you... (Am) ...it's just you.
[End]
