## 🎵 SUNDAY, DECEMBER 15

### Fool's Gold (Scheduled Release)

**YouTube Description:**
```
"Fool's Gold" — The William Altig Choir

Spent my whole life chasing diamonds made of glass...

Can you tell the difference between what shines and what's actually valuable? Old carpenters know: heartwood versus sapwood. The outside of the tree looks solid but rots fast. The core looks plain but lasts for centuries.

This song is inspired by Dhammapada verses 11-12, where the Buddha distinguishes between what merely appears valuable and what truly endures.

📿 From the Dhammapada Blues album

🎵 "Fool's Gold" — Now on YouTube

"Spent my whole life chasing diamonds made of glass..."

The Buddha knew: what shines isn't always gold. This song explores the ancient wisdom of knowing the real from the fake.

## 🎵 MONDAY, DECEMBER 16

### Fix Your Roof (Scheduled Release)

**YouTube Description:**
```
"Fix Your Roof" — The William Altig Choir

Fix your roof before the storm comes...

The Buddha dropped this metaphor to explain why some people crumble in crisis while others stay grounded. Your mind is a house. If you haven't done the work—meditation, practice, honest inner labor—every storm floods you.

📿 Inspired by Dhammapada verses 13-14

🎶 New Music: "Fix Your Roof"

The Buddha used this simple metaphor 2,500 years ago: if your roof leaks, you'll be drenched when the rain comes.

Your mind works the same way. Do the inner work NOW—while things are calm—so when life's inevitable storms hit, you stay dry inside.

What practices help you "fix your roof"? Drop a comment.

🎵 NEW SONG: "Can You Sleep At Night"

When your conscience is clear, sleep comes easy. When it's not... you know the feeling.

The Buddha taught that the wise cultivate inner peace not by escaping life, but by living rightly within it.
