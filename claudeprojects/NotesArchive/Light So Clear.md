# Light So Clear  
  
**Light So Clear** invites you on a deeply immersive journey where ancient rhythms meet shimmering ambient soundscapes. This duet blends shamanic drums, ethereal electronics, and world music textures to create a sonic space of wisdom, healing, and connection.  
  
Flowing like rivers of light through forests and deserts, the song guides you beneath the stars to find clarity and peace. It awakens the heartbeat of the Earth and opens pathways through shadow and light—inviting you to walk a path where the veil grows thin and truth shines clear.  
  
Perfect for meditation, reflection, or simply letting yourself be carried by rhythm and spirit, *Light So Clear* is a celebration of unity, timeless wisdom, and the luminous power within us all.

**Lyrics: **  
[Verse]  
May wisdom flow like rivers wide  
Through every heart let it reside  
Beneath the stars we stand in rhythm true  
The beat of drums will guide us through  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh may the merits gathered here  
Dissolve the shadows bring them near  
The sound of Earth the hum we hear  
A path we walk when all is clear  
  
[Verse 2]  
Through forest depths and desert sands  
We walk with light in open hands  
Each footstep echoes ancient calls  
A bridge of time that never falls  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh may the merits gathered here  
Dissolve the shadows bring them near  
The sound of Earth the hum we hear  
A path we walk when all is clear  
  
[Bridge]  
Drums awaken the sleeping ground  
A heartbeat lost but now it's found  
The world within and skies above  
Move like waves on seas of love  
  
[Verse 3]  
With every pulse the veil grows thin  
We find the truth under our skin  
An endless web it holds us tight  
Through shadowed night it births the light
