## *Kṣānti-Mudrā: The Silent Vow of the Bodhisattva* (“Mudrā of Endurance”)  
  
**The Vow of Quiet Strength**  
**(*A Prayer of the Bodhisattva*)**  
  
I rise with a gentle, steadfast heart,  
Where sorrow dwells and hopes depart.  
Not seeking praise, nor fearing blame,  
I bear the world’s unspoken pain.  
  
With open hands, I meet the storm,  
No shield of scorn, no hardened form.  
But clad instead in patient grace,  
I walk with peace through time and space.  
  
May I be a refuge for the lost,  
A light where paths are tempest-tossed.  
A bridge, a boat, a healing balm,  
A voice of kindness, soft and calm.  
  
Though thorns may line the narrow way,  
And bitter winds consume the day,  
I wear endurance as my shield,  
A love no darkness yet has sealed.  
  
As long as beings roam and yearn,  
And flames of greed and anger burn,  
So long shall I remain and strive,  
To keep compassion’s flame alive.  
  
For every tear, a gentle thread,  
To weave with care where hearts have bled.  
For every cry, a vow renewed,  
To offer strength in quietude.  
  
The armor I wear is woven light,  
Of giving, patience, wisdom bright.  
In silent joy, I make this stand—  
A quiet strength, an open hand.
