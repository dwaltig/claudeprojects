**Intro (Spoken or Rapped):**  
Yo, in a world of updates and fleeting trends,  
Where the scroll never stops, and the stress never ends,  
There’s a truth that’s timeless, a wisdom that grows,  
Let me break it down for you—this is the Source Code Flow.  
##   
**Verse 1:**  
I’m plugged into the matrix, drowning in streams,  
Chasing likes and follows, but losing my dreams.  
The Sutra’s the key, the master design,  
A spiritual OS that rewires my mind.  
No quick-fix app, no disposable patch,  
It’s the solar power, no trend can match.  
From the chaos of life, it’s the calm in the storm,  
A timeless upgrade, where the soul is reborn.  
##   
**Chorus:**  
(Chanted or Sung)  
Source code flow, let the Dharma show,  
Rewrite my life, let the wisdom grow.  
From the digital haze to the truths I know,  
The Lotus Sutra’s got that Source Code Flow.  
##   
**Verse 2:**  
It’s like 5G speed for the spiritual grind,  
Connecting my heart to the infinite mind.  
Other teachings lag, like a dial-up line,  
But the Sutra’s bandwidth is divine by design.  
Climate anxiety, the world’s on fire,  
But compassion’s the fuel that lifts us higher.  
It’s renewable energy for the soul’s despair,  
A solar-powered truth that’s always there.  
##   
**Chorus:**  
(Chanted or Sung)  
Source code flow, let the Dharma show,  
Rewrite my life, let the wisdom grow.  
From the digital haze to the truths I know,  
The Lotus Sutra’s got that Source Code Flow.  
##   
**Bridge (Spoken or Rapped):**  
Yo, it’s like this—  
The Sutra’s not just a book, it’s a vibe,  
A network of truths that keeps us alive.  
It’s the fiber optic cable to the heart of it all,  
While the world’s buffering, it answers the call.  
It’s not just for monks or the ancient elite,  
It’s for the hustlers, the seekers, the people in the street.  
From the mugwort to the hemp, we rise straight and tall,  
The Sutra’s the blueprint that unites us all.  
##   
**Verse 3:**  
Social disconnection, we’re lost in the feed,  
But the Sutra reminds us, we’re one in our need.  
It’s the algorithm of love, the code of compassion,  
A timeless design in a modern fashion.  
So when the world’s too loud, and you’re losing your way,  
Let the Sutra’s wisdom guide your day.  
It’s the master key, the ultimate hack,  
For a life of meaning, there’s no turning back.  
##   
**Chorus:**  
(Chanted or Sung)  
Source code flow, let the Dharma show,  
Rewrite my life, let the wisdom grow.  
From the digital haze to the truths I know,  
The Lotus Sutra’s got that Source Code Flow.  
##   
**Outro (Spoken or Rapped):**  
So don’t settle for patches, don’t settle for trends,  
The Sutra’s the upgrade that never ends.  
In a world of noise, let the Dharma glow,  
This is the Lotus Sutra’s Source Code Flow.
