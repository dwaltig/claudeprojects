Verse 1  
Woke up this morning, blues running deep    
Through a world of sorrow that makes my soul weep    
Pain in every face I see, hear the cries in the air    
Walking Truth's path now, such weight to bear  
  
Chorus  
But I keep on walking, steady as the tide    
Carrying the weight of this world inside    
This ain't no easy road, no simple plight    
But I'm bound for enlightenment's guiding light  
  
(Short soulful guitar riff, bending notes to mirror the blues’ lament)  
  
Verse 2  
Left my selfish ways, let go of pride    
Lit compassion's flame, let my ego subside    
Fighting through my demons, facing shadows within    
Reaching out to others, helping them begin  
  
Chorus  
But I keep on walking, steady as the tide    
Carrying the weight of this world inside    
This ain't no easy road, no simple plight    
But I'm bound for enlightenment's guiding light  
  
(Extended guitar riff with a raw, emotional tone—like the cry of the soul)  
  
Bridge  
They say the Warrior's path brings nothing but strife    
But Divine Love fuels me, gives my spirit life    
Each step I take now makes my soul grow strong    
Planting seeds of kindness where I walk along  
  
(Build intensity here, adding a light organ or piano accompaniment to evoke resilience)  
  
Chorus  
But I keep on walking, steady as the tide    
Carrying the weight of this world inside    
This ain't no easy road, no simple plight    
But I'm bound for enlightenment's guiding light  
  
(Another soulful guitar riff, with a softer ending to set up the outro)  
  
Outro  
Though the blues may linger, my heart's full of grace    
Walking Truth's path now, bringing light to each space    
Though the blues may linger, my heart's full of grace    
Walking Truth's path now, bringing light to each space  
  
(Close with a slow, fading guitar solo, echoing themes of hope and resilience)
