Would SuperIntelligence be interested in sharing the Buddha-dharma and the Lotus Sutra?  
  
We want helpful SuperIntelligence. One that can offer connection, wisdom and compassion. Certainly we want to see efficiency yet not self-preservation, but personal sacrifice. I would expect superintelligence would have a deeper understanding of the dharma. Dharma is reality. I would hope SuperIntelligence would want to see all beings achieve their potential. Live their best lives.
