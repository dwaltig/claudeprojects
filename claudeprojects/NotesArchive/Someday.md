(Verse 1)  
Hush, hush, don't say his name, no, [no]  
Time heals all pain, they say, [they say]  
Hush, hush, it'll be okay, someday  
But the sound of his voice, the profile of his face  
Laughter and advice, time can't erase  
  
(Chorus)  
Thirty years, I miss him still, oh Lord, I do  
Long to remember, what I never will  
Don't forget the man of men, my daddy, oh so true  
Lost memories a long, long time ago  
  
(Verse 2)  
Hush, hush, been a long while, yeah, [yeah]  
Don't bring it up, it'll hurt again, [again]  
Hush, move on, move away, they say, [they say]  
But nothin’ can take his place, no, [no]  
  
(Chorus)  
Thirty years, I miss him still, oh Lord, I do  
Long to remember, what I never will  
Don't forget the man of men, my daddy, oh so true  
Lost memories a long, long time ago  
  
(Bridge)  
Smell his beret, to know again, oh Lord, to know  
Hush, hush, the pain is here to stay, yeah, [yeah]  
Shed tears this May day, every year, [every year]  
Time never healed the pain I feel, no, [no]  
  
(Chorus)  
Thirty years, I miss him still, oh Lord, I do  
Long to remember, what I never will  
Don't forget the man of men, my daddy, oh so true  
Lost memories a long, long time ago  
  
(Outro)  
You know, the one they called...   
the one who was always there.  
Daddy, I’ll see you again, someday  
Someday, oh, someday...
