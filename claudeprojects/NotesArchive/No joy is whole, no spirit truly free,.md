No joy is whole, no spirit truly free,  
While shadows fall on another's misery.  
For sorrow's weight, not theirs alone to bear,  
Its tendrils reach, a burden we all share.  
  
The more we pour our happiness like light,  
Into the world, dispelling every night,  
The brighter then our own existence gleams,  
Reflecting back in boundless, joyful streams.  
Yet, if one heart still carries silent pain,  
A single soul where happiness can't reign,  
Our own profound completeness waits, undone,  
True peace and bliss, not perfectly begun.  
This wisdom whispers from the depths of life,  
Beyond all isolated, personal strife.  
A boundless truth, revealed for all to see:  
Our happiness entwined with empathy.
