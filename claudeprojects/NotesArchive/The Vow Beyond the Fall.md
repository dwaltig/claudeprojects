# The Vow Beyond the Fall   
  
Have you ever encountered someone whose quiet actions and unwavering spirit seemed to hold a deeper, unseen purpose, even if the world called them 'mad' or 'broken'?  
  
"The Vow Beyond the Fall" is a musical tribute to such souls – the Bodhisattvas walking among us. Inspired by the selfless dedication of figures like the revered Shantideva, this song paints a poignant picture of those who carry a sacred vow of compassion. Often misunderstood, perhaps even scorned or appearing to 'fall,' they continue to light the way, their commitment echoing "beyond the fall."  
  
From the heart of William Altig (Padmaprabha), this track explores themes of hidden sanctity, the profound strength of a vow kept through immense personal trials, and selfless service that seeks no glory. It’s an ode to the "broken and bright" beings whose every act, every breath, becomes a testament to the Dharma rolling on through "marrow and bone."  
  
May this song inspire you to see the extraordinary in the seemingly ordinary, and to recognize the quiet power of compassion that mends the world through "invisible scars."

[Verse 1]  
He walked with a lamp no one could see,  
Whispers of sutras where silence should be.  
Called him a madman, said he lost his way,  
But his tears lit the dawn like the break of day.  
  
[Verse 2]  
He climbed the heights with a vow in his chest,  
Chanted for fools, gave the broken his best.  
They laughed as he fell from the wind-worn stone,  
But the Dharma rolled on through marrow and bone.  
  
[Chorus]  
O Bodhisattva, broken and bright,  
You carried the world through a starless night.  
Not for glory, not to rise tall—  
But to keep the vow, beyond the fall.  
  
[Verse 3]  
Shantideva slipped through the cracks of men,  
They mocked him at noon, but knelt by ten.  
He vanished in verses the wise recite,  
Still walking the world in the hush of night.  
  
[Bridge]  
Crutch for the cripple, bread for the soul,  
He bore the madness to make others whole.  
The hip that shattered, the voice that cried,  
Was the wheel of the Law turning inside.  
  
[Chorus]  
O Bodhisattva, shadow and flame,  
No temple carved your holy name.  
But mercy remembers, and truth recalls—  
You kept the vow beyond the fall.  
  
[Outro]  
So if you see someone talking to stars,  
Mending the world through invisible scars—  
Don’t call them broken, don’t build a wall.  
They’re walking the vow that outlasts all.
