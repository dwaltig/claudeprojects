In the Lotus Sutra, the Buddha tells the story of how Bodhisattva Fame-Seeker was once a student of the Buddha named Wonderful Light. Wonderful Light had 800 disciples, all of whom were named Wonderful Light. The last of these disciples, however, was named Fame Seeker. Fame Seeker was attached to lucrative offerings, and he wanted to practice in order to receive notoriety.  
One day, the Buddha summoned all of his disciples to hear him teach the Lotus Sutra. When Fame Seeker heard this, he was filled with excitement. He thought that this was his chance to finally achieve fame and glory.  
The Buddha began to teach the Lotus Sutra, and Fame Seeker listened intently. As he listened, he began to realize that the Buddha was teaching something much more profound than he had ever imagined. He began to see that the true meaning of the bodhisattva path was not about fame or glory, but about compassion and wisdom.  
Fame Seeker was so moved by the Buddha's teaching that he vowed to dedicate his life to the bodhisattva path. He eventually became a great bodhisattva, and he is now known as one of the most important figures in Mahayana Buddhism.  
The story of Bodhisattva Fame-Seeker is a reminder that anyone can awaken to the true meaning of the bodhisattva path, no matter what their initial motivations may be. It is a story of hope and inspiration, and it shows us that it is never too late to change our ways and dedicate our lives to the service of others.
