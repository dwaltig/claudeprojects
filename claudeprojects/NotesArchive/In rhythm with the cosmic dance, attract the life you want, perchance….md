In rhythm with the cosmic dance, attract the life you want, perchance,  
Align your pulse with what you seek, in every thought and speak.  
The universe, a resonating band, will grasp your wish, in its grand hand.  
  
Vibration, more than sight or touch, a secret language meaning much,  
A frequency unseen, yet felt, can make the hardest heartbeats melt.  
The life you want, its cadence clear, hums softly in the willing ear,  
Tune in, tune-up, and your spirit's song, and you'll be where you truly belong.  
  
Everything you crave, and desire, fuels the universe's choir,  
It's not afar or elsewhere, but dwelling deep in the heart's lair.  
In the now, in the here, every dream, every cheer,  
Is waiting just for you to see, the power of your own decree.  
  
Like the lark to morning's light, or the moth to moon's soft night,  
Become a match, a vibrational pair, to all you want, in earth and air.  
As the magnet draws the iron core, let your szpirit and your dreams explore,  
For what you seek, with heart sincere, rest assured, is already here.  
  
Believe, envision, then let go, trust the river's ebb and flow,  
For the cosmos knows your heart's true print, every wish, every hint.  
Be a beacon, burn so bright, resonate with all your might,  
And watch as life, in magic's might, brings all your dreams into the light.
