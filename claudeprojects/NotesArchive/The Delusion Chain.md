# The Delusion Chain  
  
A blues-folk confession about carrying the weight of our own minds. Starting in the darkness of recognition and moving toward the light of shared burden, this song traces the journey from isolation to acknowledgment—where simply naming what we carry begins to break its hold.  
  
Inspired by Chapter Twenty-Four of the Lotus Sūtra, "The Delusion Chain" catalogs the six afflictions—greed, anger, ignorance, jealousy, stinginess, and arrogance—that obscure our clarity and peace. But the song's real subject is what happens when we stop carrying these burdens alone.  
  
In the tradition of Robert Johnson's crossroads darkness and Mississippi John Hurt's front-porch wisdom, with early Dylan's confessional storytelling throughout, this is a song about how recognition becomes liberation, and how asking for help is itself the answer.  
  
"The moment that I name what's holding me / I ain't carrying this delusion all alone, you see"

Lyrics:   
  
[Verse 1]  
Woke up this morning with a weight I can't name  
Six different devils all playing the same game  
Got greed in my pocket, got anger in my bones  
Jealousy whispering through the telephone  
  
[Verse 2]  
Stinginess counting every coin I save  
Arrogance telling me I'm too good to behave  
Ignorance smiling like an old, old friend  
Can't see the teaching through the fog I'm in  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm dragging this delusion chain  
Link by link in the pouring rain  
Too much greed and not enough wisdom, Lord  
Can't find the key to break this chain  
  
[Verse 3]  
Tried to read the good book, couldn't see the page  
My attachments got attachments keeping me in this cage  
Every desire's got a desire of its own  
I'm obscuring my own path, reaping what I've sown  
  
[Bridge]  
Now, I ain't saying I'm the only fool  
Who mistakes his confusion for something cool  
But when you're carrying six kinds of heavy all day  
You start to wonder if there ain't a better way  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm dragging this delusion chain  
Link by link in the pouring rain  
Too much greed and not enough wisdom, Lord  
Can't find the key to break this chain  
  
[Verse 4 - tempo softens, opens up]  
So I'm singing you this song, laying my burden down  
Telling you the truth I finally found  
The moment that I name what's holding me  
I ain't carrying this delusion all alone, you see  
  
[Verse 5 - gentle, clear]  
Recognition's like a question asked out loud  
Breaks the spell of walking in a cloud  
When I show you all my greed and jealous ways  
The teaching starts to shine through the haze  
  
[Chorus - modified, lighter]  
I'm naming this delusion chain  
Speaking it out loud eases the pain  
Still got greed, but I got wisdom growing, Lord  
And sharing the burden starts to break this chain  
  
[Outro - quiet, intimate, almost spoken]  
Six links make a chain  
One voice breaks the hold  
The asking is the answer  
The telling makes me whole  
Brother, can you hear me?  
I'm not alone no more
