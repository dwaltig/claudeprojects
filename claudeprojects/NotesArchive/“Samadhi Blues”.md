# “Samadhi Blues”  
  
*“Samadhi Blues” is a soulful journey that merges the raw emotion of blues with the serene depths of meditation. This song takes you into the heart of a musician’s search for truth and peace, capturing the essence of ancient wisdom through the rhythm of modern blues. Inspired by samadhi—the profound meditative states described in the Lotus Sutra—this track explores the beauty of boundless awareness, clear perception, and inner tranquility. With a touch of cosmic wonder, each note resonates with the feeling of transcendence and unity, bringing you closer to an unfiltered view of reality.*  
  
*Close your eyes, let the music flow through you, and feel yourself drift into a state of boundless peace. This isn’t just a blues song; it’s an invitation to experience life as it is—clear, undistorted, and full of wonder. So grab your headphones, take a deep breath, and let “Samadhi Blues” carry you into a world where sound becomes silence, and silence becomes light.*  
  
*Verse 1:*  
  
Woke up this morning, with a clear and open mind,  
Been walkin’ this path, leavin’ all my doubts behind.  
Through the Lotus Sutra, and the Dharma’s ancient ways,  
I’ve been searchin’ for the truth, in these meditative days.  
  
*Chorus:*  
  
I’ve got those Samadhi blues, feelin’ lighter than air,  
Boundless awareness, takes me everywhere.  
Seein’ all forms as they are, clear and true,  
Livin’ in the moment, with these Samadhi blues.  
  
*Verse 2:*  
  
In the silence of my soul, distractions fade away,  
Pure and undistracted, I find my way to stay.  
Anilambha’s boundless sky, no anchor do I need,  
Floating in awareness, my spirit has been freed.  
  
*Chorus:*  
  
I’ve got those Samadhi blues, feelin’ lighter than air,  
Boundless awareness, takes me everywhere.  
Seein’ all forms as they are, clear and true,  
Livin’ in the moment, with these Samadhi blues.  
  
*Bridge:*  
  
Śūraṅgama whispers, all the teachings I retain,  
Wisdom flows within me, like an endless pouring rain.  
Compassion in my heart, and clarity in sight,  
Embracing all the darkness, and turning it to light.  
  
*Verse 3:*  
  
Every step I take now, is filled with peace and grace,  
The echoes of enlightenment, shine upon my face.  
Through dedication’s fire, I’ve walked this noble road,  
Carrying the Dharma, to lighten others’ load.  
  
*Chorus:*  
  
I’ve got those Samadhi blues, feelin’ lighter than air,  
Boundless awareness, takes me everywhere.  
Seein’ all forms as they are, clear and true,  
Livin’ in the moment, with these Samadhi blues.  
  
*Outro:*  
  
Yes, I’m livin’ in the moment,  
With these Samadhi blues.
