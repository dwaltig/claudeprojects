# Welling Up From the Ground  
  
*“Welling Up from the Ground”* is a powerful gospel-blues folk anthem inspired by Chapter Fifteen of the *Lotus Sutra*—the moment when the earth itself trembles, and countless Bodhisattvas rise from the soil of suffering to bring light to the age of darkness. The song blends sacred soul with modern storytelling, featuring rich harmonies, Hammond organ swells, and a radiant choir that celebrates the truth that salvation doesn’t descend from above—it blossoms from within. This is music for those who’ve walked through fire and found their strength in the ashes. The hero isn’t in the clouds—the hero is in the ground, and the power’s in you now.

## Lyrics with Detailed Section Prompts:  
  
[Verse 1]  
[Style: Soft, reverent intro. Sparse acoustic guitar and gentle piano. Church-like feel.]  
We gathered in the Ceremony in the Air  
From countless other worlds, we traveled there  
We saw the suffering in this sahā land  
And raised a compassionate and helping hand  
We made a vow, "After you’re gone, we will remain  
Through the perilous age of sorrow and of pain  
We will protect and preach this Sūtra true"  
It was the noblest thing that we could do.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
[Style: Music builds tension. Hammond B3 organ slowly swells in. Rhythm becomes more defined.]  
But the World-Honored One just smiled and shook his head  
"Your help is not required here," he softly said  
"Don't you worry for this world of mine  
This world of suffering can heal its own  
There's a seed of power in the sorrow sown."  
  
[Chorus]  
[Style: Powerful, joyous full band. Soulful gospel choir enters with force. Driving rhythm with drums and tambourine.]  
And then the ground began to tremble and to break!  
The earth tore open, for this world's own sake  
And from the very soil of suffering and doubt  
A million golden heroes started welling out!  
And the truth just hit me, like a thunder sound  
The greatest hero isn't from the clouds  
The hero is right here, rooted in the ground.  
I don't need a savior; the power’s in me now!  
  
[Verse 2]  
[Style: Majestic, full-bodied. The full band and rhythm continue, supporting the lead vocal. Organ is prominent.]  
More countless than the sands along the Ganges streams  
They rose up like the substance of our deepest dreams  
With golden bodies, shining with a brilliant light  
With all the marks of greatness, shinin' in the light  
Led by Superior Practices, the chief and first  
They’d been waiting for the proper time to burst  
Not from some distant land, but right beneath our feet  
The ones to make this broken, bitter world complete.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
[Style: Dynamic dip. Music pulls back slightly, feeling more introspective. Lead vocal is clear.]  
And the Buddha said, "Behold, these are my sons  
The ones I’ve taught since time itself begun  
They are my disciples from the remotest past."  
A holy paradox, too deep and vast...  
  
[Chorus]  
[Style: Second chorus. Even bigger and more joyous than the first. Choir is very strong and celebratory.]  
And the ground began to tremble and to break!  
The earth tore open, for this world's own sake  
And from the very soil of suffering and doubt  
A million golden heroes started welling out!  
And the truth just hit me, like a thunder sound  
The greatest hero isn't from the clouds  
The hero is right here, rooted in the ground.  
I don't need a savior; the power’s in me now!  
  
[Bridge]  
[Style: Intimate, gospel testimony. Music pulls back to just lead vocal, piano, and organ swells. Reflective and personal.]  
Even Maitreya, the "Invincible" one  
He had to ask, "My Lord, how could this be done?  
You’ve only taught for forty-some-odd years  
How did you raise this host that calms all fears?"  
His question was the key that opened up the door  
To make the walls of history and logic fall  
This is the mission for this final, broken age  
When mappō’s darkness covers up the page  
We are the ones who chose to be right here  
To transform destiny and conquer every fear.  
  
[Outro / Vamp]  
[Style: Joyful, repetitive climax. Full band and choir. Hand claps and tambourine. Music builds, ad-libs from choir and lead vocal.]  
And Nichiren said, "Listen! This is emerging from the earth!"  
Every time one person finds their sacred worth  
When first one chants, then two, and then a hundred more  
This is the army welling up from the planet’s floor!  
This is the work we do!  
This is our vow!  
Transforming the sahā world, right here and now!  
  
[Ad-lib vocals]  
[Style: Choir and lead vocal ad-libbing over the vamp. Music builds to a final hit or fades out slowly.]  
We are the ones!  
Welling up! Welling up!  
From the ground! From the ground!  
The power’s in me now!  
The hero’s in the ground...  
(Music fades)
