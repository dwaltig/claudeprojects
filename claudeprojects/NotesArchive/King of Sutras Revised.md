## King of Sutras: Revised  
  
The **Lotus Sutra**, King of Sutras, grand,   
A sacred truth across the Mahayana land.   
Its **wisdom profound**, a teaching to unveil,   
A path to inner peace, where doubts now fail.  
  
**Śāriputra** heard, his mind serene as sea,   
His mesh of doubts removed, for all to see.   
Though wise, Nirvana seemed his destined goal,   
The Sutra showed a deeper path, to make the spirit whole.  
  
No longer provisional, the **One Vehicle** bright,   
Unites all paths in singular, pure light.   
Through **skillful means**, the Buddha gently guides,   
Expedient tools where ultimate truth resides.  
  
Like children in a house ablaze, caught in their play,   
Called forth by promise to a safer day.   
The three small carts, a provisional lure,   
To One great carriage, universally pure.  
  
A **jewel unseen**, sewn in a pauper's robe,   
**Buddha-nature** within, a universal probe.   
Unrecognized wealth, though suffering he knew,   
The inherent potential now shining through.  
  
As rain on diverse plants falls equally kind,   
The **Dharma** embraced by every heart and mind.   
Each being's capacity receives what it needs,   
Universal compassion sowing awakening seeds.  
  
A **phantom city** built for weary souls to rest,   
Not the true treasure, but a vital test.   
For provisional teachings, a journey's embrace,   
Lead to ultimate truth with boundless grace.  
  
For **Buddhahood's within**, for every soul to claim,   
Irrespective of all—gender, status, name.   
A human dignity profound the Sutra sings,   
Dispelling all fear on courage's wings.  
  
Transforming suffering to joy's sweet art,   
A change in one's heart transforms every part.   
Our mind and the world together find their peace,   
From delusion to **Buddha land**, all suffering cease.  
  
Through faith and true practice, with study's deep light,   
**Innate Buddhahood** emerges, shining ever so bright.   
A **cosmic humanism** for ages to unfold,   
A pure land of compassion, a story to be told.  
  
The Sutra's legacy: a purpose and a hope,   
Actively engaged with life, across its fullest scope.   
An unshakeable happiness for all to realize,   
The **Mystic Law's** truth before awakened eyes.
