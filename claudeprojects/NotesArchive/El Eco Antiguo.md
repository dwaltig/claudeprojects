[Verse 1]  
Ancient whispers flow through my veins,  
Echoes from the Lotus, breaking chains,  
Roots deep in soil, tales of old,  
In the quiet, stories unfold.  
  
[Chorus]  
Rhythmic prayers rise, melody spreads,  
Chords of awakening, wisdom threads,  
Heartbeat syncing with today's vibe,  
In this ancient rhythm, we thrive.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Temple walls and moonlit skies,  
Sacred chants beneath my cries,  
Drum beats pulse, heart awakens,  
Echoes live, no more forsaken.  
  
[Bridge]  
Silent whispers turn to roars,  
Wisdom trekking distant shores,  
Old meets new, time's embrace,  
In the rhythm, we find grace.  
  
[Verse 3]  
Scrolls and scriptures, in my flow,  
Timeless tales, now we sow,  
Cycles spinning, echoes blend,  
Rhythm eternal, no end.

Rhythmic prayers rise, melody spreads,  
Chords of awakening, wisdom threads,  
Heartbeat syncing with today's vibe,  
In this ancient rhythm, we thrive.
