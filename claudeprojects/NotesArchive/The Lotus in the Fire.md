# The Lotus in the Fire  
#   
A world ablaze, deluded voices cry:  
“Kalpas of destruction” loom, and fears run high.  
Perception veiled by Moha’s heavy haze,  
Mind’s constructs of doom ensnare our days.     
  
Yet thus-come One proclaims with gentle grace:  
“This world of mine is peaceful, fear finds no place.”  
My lifespan boundless—never set to cease—  
An endless Dharma-body of wondrous peace.     
  
Like skilled physician tending children’s pain,  
He offers antidotes time and again.  
Feigning his passing stirs a longing flame—  
Skillful upāya saves through sovereign aim.    
  
Pure Land’s true nature, tranquil at its core,  
Though blinded eyes may see its surface sore.  
Not two realms, but one revealed to those who see:  
The One-Vehicle’s joy in non-duality.    
  
When wondrous Dharma wakes our hearts anew,  
Impermanence dissolves, no fixed self true.  
Compassion blossoms on this fertile field,  
Awakening Buddhanature yet concealed.    
  
And from the murky depths, the lotus springs,  
Unstained by mud—pure heart that wisdom brings.  
No fear remains when transient forms take flight—  
Eternal Buddha guides from dark to light.
