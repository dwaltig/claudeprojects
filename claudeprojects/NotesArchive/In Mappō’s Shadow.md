# In Mappō’s Shadow  
  
In **Mappō's** shadow, where the old ways fade,   
A **Latter Age of Degeneration**, dark and afraid.   
With turmoil's echoes and spirits confused,   
Traditional wisdom, its power diffused.   
**Upaya's** gentle touch, once wise and so deep,   
Now falters and stumbles, as sorrows still creep.  
  
Then **Nichiren** arose, from chaos and strife,   
With a **great vow** burning, to awaken all life.   
No subtle discernment for souls lost astray,   
But a direct, shining truth to light up the way.   
For the "ignorant persons," though lacking in might,   
Hold a paradox: receptive to ultimate light.  
  
From his heart, a **true teaching**, a vibrant decree,   
The **Lotus Sūtra's** essence, for all to be free.   
**Nam-myoho-renge-kyo**, the **Daimoku's** strong call,   
Awakens **Buddhahood's** seed, latent in all.   
No need for long lifetimes, nor complex designs,   
But **faith in one's potential**, where true wisdom shines.  
  
With **shakubuku's** fervor, a compassion so bold,   
The **poison-drum relationship**, a story unfolds.   
Even rejection, a seed deeply sown,   
A path to enlightenment, eternally known.   
Through hardships and trials, by prophecy met,   
His mission affirmed, with no room for regret.  
  
For **kosen-rufu**, the vision so grand,   
A peaceful world rising, across every land.   
A **religion for humanity**, inclusive and vast,   
Where every soul's potential is destined to last.   
So let the **Daimoku** resound, strong and clear,   
Dispelling all shadows, conquering all fear.
