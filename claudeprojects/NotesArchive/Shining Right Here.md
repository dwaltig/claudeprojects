# Shining Right Here  
  
“Shining Right Here” is a soulful, blues-inspired anthem born from the timeless wisdom of the Lotus Sutra. Rooted in the tradition of seeing beauty beneath life’s struggles, this song blends the deep ache of the blues with a message of hope and awakening.  
  
Inspired by the famous lines from Chapter 16—where the Pure Land is ever-present though often unseen—the lyrics invite you to change your perspective, let go of fear, and discover the brilliance already shining in your life. With heartfelt verses and a chorus that soars like sunlight through storm clouds, “Shining Right Here” is a reminder that even in the hardest times, joy and peace are just one clear vision away.  
Let this song be your companion on the road: a little blues, a little light, and a whole lot of love for the real world, just as it is.  
  
*Listen, share, and let the Pure Land appear right where you are.*

Lyrics:   
Verse 1:  
Woke up this morning, felt that heavy old sky  
World looked gray and empty, couldn’t help but wonder why  
But then a little voice inside me whispered clear—  
“This sorrow you’re feelin’? Buddha’s already here…”  
  
Pre-Chorus:  
I was searchin’ for heaven, far away and blue,  
Never saw that heaven, shining in my view  
  
Chorus:  
So I changed my eyes, my heart, my mind,  
Saw the world so bright, I left fear behind  
Oh, this world ain’t broken, it’s shining right here—  
If you clear your vision, the Pure Land appears  
  
Verse 2:  
Folks walk by in silence, heads hung low in pain,  
They say the fire’s coming, life just ain’t the same  
Well, let me tell you, brother, let me tell you true—  
The beauty you’re missin’ is just hidin’ from you  
  
Pre-Chorus:  
There’s a song in the silence, light behind those tears,  
Every moment sacred, when the Lotus appears  
  
Chorus:  
So I changed my eyes, my heart, my mind,  
Saw the world so bright, I left fear behind  
Oh, this world ain’t broken, it’s shining right here—  
If you clear your vision, the Pure Land appears  
  
Bridge:  
Step outside your sorrow, step into the light,  
Dance with all your darkness, hold your pain so tight  
‘Cause the Buddha’s been smilin’, every mile, every year—  
You’re already home, my dear  
  
Chorus/Outro:  
So let’s change our eyes, our hearts, our minds,  
Find the truth together, leave old fear behind  
Oh, this world ain’t broken, it’s shining right here  
Right here, right now, let the Pure Land appear
