Verse 1:  
Walking down that lonely road,   
a son who's lost his way,  
Left his father's loving arms,   
searching for a brighter day.  
In the shadows of his past,   
he wanders far from home,  
A voice of love calls him back,   
where he’s never alone.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, the Buddha sings the blues,   
with a heart so full of grace,  
Guiding every wayward soul,   
to a warm and safe embrace.  
In the melody of kindness,   
find the truth that sets you free,  
The wayward son returns again,   
to where he's meant to be.  
  
Verse 2:  
In the quiet of the night,   
a whisper soft and clear,  
The wisdom of the ages speaks,   
melting away the fear.  
Through the trials and tribulations,   
there's a path that’s always near,  
The Buddha's blues will lead you on,   
with a love sincere.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, the Buddha sings the blues,   
with a heart so full of grace,  
Guiding every wayward soul,   
to a warm and safe embrace.  
In the melody of kindness,   
find the truth that sets you free,  
The wayward son returns again,   
to where he's meant to be.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
Bridge:  
Every step of pain and sorrow,   
every tear that falls,  
Leads us to a place of peace,   
where compassion calls.  
In the rhythm of the world,   
the blues of life unfold,  
The Buddha's song of endless love,   
a story to be told.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, the Buddha sings the blues,   
with a heart so full of grace,  
Guiding every wayward soul,   
to a warm and safe embrace.  
In the melody of kindness,   
find the truth that sets you free,  
The wayward son returns again,   
to where he's meant to be.  
  
Outro:  
So if you find you're feeling lost,   
and darkness hides the light,  
Remember the Buddha's blues,   
and you'll make it through the night.  
With every note of sorrow sung,   
there's a promise of the dawn,  
The wayward son finds peace at last,   
in the Buddha’s gentle song.
