Chapter 2 Expedient Means  
  
At that time the world-honored one calmly arose from his samadhi and addressed Shariputra, saying: “The wisdom of the Buddhas is infinitely profound and immeasurable. The door to this wisdom is difficult to understand and difficult to enter. Not one of my disciples or cause-awakened-ones are able to comprehend it.  
  
“What is the reason for this? The Buddhas have personally attended a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, a million, a countless number of buddhas and have fully carried out an immeasurable number of Buddhas’ ways and doctrines. They have exerted themselves bravely and vigorously, and their names are universally known. They have realized the Law that is profound and never known before, and preach it in accordance with what is appropriate, yet their intentions are difficult to understand.  
  
“Shariputra, ever since I attained Buddhahood I have through various causes and various similes widely expounded my teachings and have used countless expedient means to guide living beings and cause them to renounce their attachments. Why is this? Because the thus come ones are fully possessed of both expedient means and the paramita of wisdom.  
  
“**Shariputra, the wisdom of the thus come ones is expansive and profound. They have immeasurable compassion, unlimited eloquence, power, fearlessness, concentration, emancipation, and samadhis, and have deeply entered the boundless and awakened to the Law never before attained.**  
  
“Shariputra, the thus come ones know how to make various distinctions and to expound the teachings skillfully. Their words are soft and gentle and can delight the hearts of the assembly.  
  
“Shariputra, to sum it up: the Buddhas have fully realized the Law that is limitless, boundless, never attained before.  
  
“But stop, Shariputra, I will say no more. Why? Because what the Buddhas have achieved is the rarest and most difficult-to-understand Law. The true aspect of all phenomena can only be understood and shared between Buddhas.   
  
This reality consists of the appearance, nature, entity, power, influence, internal cause, relation, latent effect, manifest effect, and their consistency from beginning to end.”

Chapter 16 The Lifespan of the Thus Come One  
  
Since I attained buddhahood  
the number of kalpas that have passed is an immeasurable hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, millions, trillions, asamkhyas.  
  
Constantly I have preached the Law, teaching, converting  
countless millions of living beings, causing them to enter the buddha way, all this for immeasurable kalpas.  
  
In order to save living beings,  
as an expedient means I appear to enter nirvana but in truth I do not pass into extinction.  
I am always here, preaching the Law. I am always here, but through my transcendental powers I make it so that living beings in their befuddlement  
do not see me even when close by.  
  
When the multitude sees that I have passed into extinction,  
far and wide they offer alms to my relics. All harbor thoughts of yearning and in their minds thirst to gaze at me.  
  
When living beings have become truly faithful,  
honest and upright, gentle in intent, single-mindedly desiring to see the Buddha, not hesitating even if it costs them their lives,  
then I and the assembly of monks appear together on Holy Eagle Peak.  
  
At that time I tell the living beings  
that I am always here, never entering extinction, but that because of the power of expedient means at times I appear to be extinct, at other times not, and that if there are living beings in other lands who are reverent and sincere in their wish to believe, then among them too I will preach the unsurpassed Law. But you have not heard of this, so you suppose that I enter extinction.  
  
When I look at living beings  
I see them drowned in a sea of suffering; therefore I do not show myself, causing them to thirst for me.  
  
Then when their minds are filled with yearning, at last I appear and preach the Law for them.  
Such are my transcendental powers.  
  
For asamkhya kalpas  
constantly I have dwelled on Holy Eagle Peak and in various other places.  
  
When living beings witness the end of a kalpa and all is consumed in a great fire, this, my land, remains safe and tranquil, constantly filled with heavenly and human beings.  
  
The halls and pavilions in its gardens and groves are adorned with various kinds of gems.  
Jeweled trees abound in flowers and fruit where living beings enjoy themselves at ease.  
The gods strike heavenly drums,  
constantly making many kinds of music.  
  
Mandarava blossoms rain down,  
scattering over the Buddha and the great assembly.  
  
My pure land is not destroyed,  
yet the multitude sees it as consumed in fire, with anxiety, fear, and other sufferings  
filling it everywhere.  
  
These living beings with their various offenses, through causes arising from their evil actions, spend asamkhya kalpas  
without hearing the name of the three treasures.  
  
But those who practice meritorious ways, who are gentle, peaceful, honest, and upright, all of them will see me  
here in person, preaching the Law.  
  
At times for this multitude  
I describe the Buddha’s life span as immeasurable, and to those who see the Buddha only after a long time I explain how difficult it is to meet a buddha.  
  
Such is the power of my wisdom  
that its sagacious beams shine without measure.   
  
This life span of countless kalpas I gained as the result of lengthy practice.  
  
You who are possessed of wisdom, entertain no doubts on this point!  
  
Cast them off, end them forever,  
for the Buddha’s words are true, not false.  
  
He is like a skilled physician  
who uses an expedient means to cure his deranged sons.  
  
Though in fact alive, he gives out word he is dead, yet no one can say he speaks falsely.  
  
I am the father of this world,  
saving those who suffer and are afflicted.  
  
Because of the befuddlement of ordinary people, though I live, I give out word I have entered extinction.  
  
For if they see me constantly,  
arrogance and selfishness arise in their minds.  
  
Abandoning restraint, they give themselves up to the five desires  
and fall into the evil paths of existence.  
  
Always I am aware of which living beings practice the way, and which do not, and in response to their need for salvation I preach various doctrines for them.  
  
At all times I think to myself:  
How can I cause living beings  
to gain entry into the unsurpassed way and quickly acquire the body of a bhuddha?
