# Dancing with the Cosmos  
  
[Verse 1]  
Walking down   
this winding road,  
The stars align,   
their secrets showed.  
Every step,   
a guiding light,  
Echoes in   
the silent night.  
  
[Chorus]  
Trust the rhythm,   
trust the flow,  
In the dance,   
our spirits grow.  
Every moment,   
every sign,  
Part of the grand design.  
Part of the grand design.  
  
[Verse 2]  
In the whispers   
of the breeze,  
In the rustling   
of the trees,  
Signs and wonders,   
subtle cues,  
Universe   
in perfect hues.  
  
[Chorus]  
Trust the rhythm,   
trust the flow,  
In the dance,   
our spirits grow.  
Every moment,   
every sign,  
Part of the grand design.  
Part of the grand design.

[Verse 2]  
In the whispers

In the rustling

Signs and wonders,   
subtle cues,  
Universe   
in perfect hues.  
  
[Chorus]  
Trust the rhythm,   
trust the flow,  
In the dance,   
our spirits grow.  
Every moment,   
every sign,  
Part of the grand design.  
Part of the grand design.

[Bridge]  
Synchronicities,   
they call to me,  
Markers on my path,   
I see.  
Dancing with the cosmos,   
free,  
Exactly where I’m meant to be.  
Exactly where I’m meant to be.  
  
[Chorus]  
Trust the rhythm,   
trust the flow,  
In the dance,   
our spirits grow.  
Every moment,   
every sign,  
Part of the grand design.  
Part of the grand design.  
  
Synchronicities,   
they call to me,  
Markers on my path,   
I see.  
Dancing with the cosmos,   
free,  
Exactly where I’m meant to be.  
Exactly where I’m meant to be.  
  
[Chorus]  
Trust the rhythm,   
trust the flow,  
In the dance,   
our spirits grow.  
Every moment,   
every sign,  
Part of the grand design.  
Part of the grand design.  
  
Outro:  
Embrace the journey,   
let it guide,  
With the universe,   
side by side.  
In this dance,   
we find our way,  
Synchronicities,   
light our day.
