Justice Blues  
  
[Verse 1]  
In a world so cold, where shadows play,  
I'm walkin' down this lonesome road each day,  
With a heart full of faith and a mind so clear,  
I seek the truth, there's no room for fear.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, justice blues, sing me a song,  
Where the weak are strong, and the right belong,  
In this world of strife, where the truth must rise,  
We'll find our way under righteous skies.  
  
[Verse 2]  
I've seen the wicked laugh, seen the innocent fall,  
But I know deep down there's a higher call,  
With every step I take, with every prayer I send,  
I'm fightin' for the light, on which we all depend.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, justice blues, sing me a song,  
Where the weak are strong, and the right belong,  
In this world of strife, where the truth must rise,  
We'll find our way under righteous skies.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[Bridge]  
Let the winds of change blow through this land,  
With the strength of love, we’ll make a stand,  
For the righteous path and the hearts so pure,  
In the arms of justice, we'll endure.  
  
[Verse 3]  
When the dark clouds gather and the thunder rolls,  
I'll keep my faith, I'll protect my soul,  
For I know one day, the dawn will break,  
And justice will reign, for goodness' sake.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, justice blues, sing me a song,  
Where the weak are strong, and the right belong,  
In this world of strife, where the truth must rise,  
We'll find our way under righteous skies.  
  
[Outro]  
So raise your voice, let the truth be told,  
In this weary world, let our hearts be bold,  
With the justice blues, we'll pave the way,  
For a brighter dawn and a fairer day.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, justice blues, sing me a song,  
Where the weak are strong, and the right belong,  
In this world of strife, where the truth must rise,  
We'll find our way under righteous skies.  
  
[Outro]  
So raise your voice, let the truth be told,  
In this weary world, let our hearts be bold,  
With the justice blues, we'll pave the way,  
For a brighter dawn and a fairer day.
