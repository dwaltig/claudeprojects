(Verse 1)  
I been walkin' this long road, don’t know where it ends,  
With a heart full of questions and wounds I can't mend.  
But I trust in the truth, yeah, I’m holdin' it tight,  
Through the darkest of nights, I’m searchin' for the light.  
  
(Verse 2)  
I seen folks with riches, but they still walk blind,  
I got nothin' but love, and I’m still doin' fine.  
I’ll give what I can, with these hands worn and tired,  
'Cause to lift another soul, that’s all I require.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, I’m diggin' deep, in this soul of mine,  
Chasin' a truth that stands the test of time.  
Gonna give it all, give it all away,  
For the sake of love, I’ll never turn away.  
'Cause the yearning in my heart, is callin' me strong,  
To practice wisdom and faith, where I belong.  
  
(Bridge)  
And in this search for truth, I see the light, in every face,  
In the highs and lows of this human race.  
We're all connected, every soul, every hand,  
I’ll walk this path, with love, right where I stand.  
  
(Verse 3)  
Some folks wait for heaven, but I’m here right now,  
Plantin' seeds of peace with respect and with love, somehow,  
Tendin' to the garden, with wisdom and care,  
Knowing every action, is a whispered prayer.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, I’m diggin' deep, in this soul of mine,  
Chasin' a truth that stands the test of time.  
Gonna give it all, give it all away,  
For the sake of love, I’ll never turn away.  
'Cause the yearning in my heart, is callin' me strong,  
To practice wisdom and faith, where I belong.  
  
(Outro)  
Yeah, the yearning in my heart, where I belong,  
I’ll keep walkin' this path, all the way home.
