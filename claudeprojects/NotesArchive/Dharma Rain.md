[Lyrics:]  
(Verse 1)  
In whispers of the Dharma,   
where the truth unfolds,  
Gentle rain of wisdom,   
touching hearts untold.  
From a vast and mighty cloud,   
drops of grace do fall,  
Nourishing every soul,   
great and small.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, Dharma rain,   
come nourish me,  
With your gentle touch,   
set my spirit free.  
Universal truth,   
from the heavens above,  
Teach me the ways of compassion   
and love.  
  
(Verse 2)  
Like a precious blossom,   
rare and bright,  
Dharma's teachings,   
shining in the night.  
Rays of the gem,   
banners in the sky,  
Illuminate the path,   
where spirits fly.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, Dharma rain,   
come nourish me,  
With your gentle touch,   
set my spirit free.  
Universal truth,   
from the heavens above,  
Teach me the ways of compassion   
and love.  
  
(Bridge)  
A skilled physician,   
with a heart so kind,  
Heals the weary soul,   
eases the troubled mind.  
With tender wisdom,   
guiding us through,  
Showing the way,   
in all that we do.  
  
(Verse 3)  
Though paths may diverge,   
there's one true way,  
A single vehicle,   
where lost find their stay.  
An ocean of wisdom,   
deep and vast,  
Boundless truths,   
forever to last.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, Dharma rain,   
come nourish me,  
With your gentle touch,   
set my spirit free.  
Universal truth,   
from the heavens above,  
Teach me the ways of compassion   
and love.  
  
(Outro)  
In the Dharma's embrace,   
we find our light,  
A precious gift,   
shining ever bright.  
Rooted in compassion,   
ending all pain,  
Transforming hearts,   
like cleansing rain.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, Dharma rain,   
come nourish me,  
With your gentle touch,   
set my spirit free.  
Universal truth,   
from the heavens above,  
Teach me the ways of compassion   
and love.
