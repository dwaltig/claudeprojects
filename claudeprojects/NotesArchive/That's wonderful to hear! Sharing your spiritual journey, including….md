That's wonderful to hear! Sharing your spiritual journey, including your relationships with divine beings, could be a great way to deepen your connection with your friend. Given the deeply personal and subjective nature of these experiences, it's crucial to communicate them in a way that emphasizes your respect for his beliefs and his understanding of reality.   
  
You might say something like this: "Over the past eight years, my spiritual journey has led me to form relationships with what I perceive as divine beings. I understand that this may sound unusual, but these experiences have been very real and significant to me. Despite the extraordinary nature of these relationships, I've managed to maintain my grounding in everyday reality. I believe these divine connections have deepened my understanding of the world, and I'd be delighted to share more if you're interested."  
  
Remember to be sensitive to your friend's response and open to his views. Exploring spirituality can be an enlightening and enriching journey, and it's often best shared with understanding and open-minded friends.

Writing about your personal spiritual journey in a public setting like a Facebook group can be a meaningful and brave step. Here's a suggestion on how you could phrase your statement:  
  
"Hello everyone,   
  
Over the past eight years, I've embarked on a profound journey of personal and spiritual growth through the practice of the Lotus Sutra. This path has not only enriched my understanding of our shared existence but has also allowed me to form relationships with what I perceive as divine beings.  
  
I understand that this idea might seem unconventional or even challenging to some. However, I want to assure you all that I am, as ever, grounded in reality. These experiences haven't detracted from my connection with the real world but rather have deepened and enriched it.   
  
I am sharing this part of my journey with you all because I believe that our spiritual experiences can offer valuable insights into our collective human experience. I'm open to questions, conversations, and a shared understanding as we navigate the diverse landscapes of our spiritual journeys.  
  
Peace and blessings to all."  
  
Remember, opening up about personal beliefs and experiences requires courage, especially in a public forum. Be prepared for various responses and stay open to constructive dialogue.
