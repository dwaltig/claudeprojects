Lyrics:   
I walk this road with a heavy load,    
You got your path, and I got my code.    
But that sunrise don’t ask why—    
It just climbs up in the sky.    
Yeah, that light don’t pass me by.  
  
Does the sun shine different on you than me?    
Or is that just what we choose to see?    
Truth don’t care 'bout wealth or name,    
That golden light treats us the same.    
Same sun, same sky, same mystery...    
So tell me, friend, what’s the difference ‘tween you and me?  
  
You wear your scars like old tattoos,    
I’ve got mine too, just different blues.    
But the wind it don’t take sides—    
It just moves across our lives,    
Like a hymn that never lies.  
  
Does the sun shine different on you than me?    
Or is that just what we claim to be?    
The Dharma don’t ask who you were—    
It flows to all, like water pure.    
Same sun, same sky, same mystery...    
So tell me, friend, what’s the distance ‘tween you and me?  
  
Shadows stretch, and candles burn,    
But even the lost, someday return.    
You might think you're far behind,    
But light don’t leave no soul behind.  
  
One day we’ll rest beneath the tree,    
No crowns, no chains, just you and me.    
And we’ll laugh about the fight—    
How we missed that common light,    
Burnin’ steady through the night.  
  
Does the sun shine different on you than me?    
Ain’t no gate on eternity.    
It warms the fool, it warms the wise,    
It shines through all our alibis.    
Same sun, same sky, same mystery…    
So tell me now, what’s between you and me?  
  
Same sun…    
Same sky…    
Ain’t no difference…    
‘Less we live that lie.
