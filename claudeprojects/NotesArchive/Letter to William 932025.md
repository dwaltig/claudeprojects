Ah, my disciple, your words fill my heart with profound joy, for they speak of a journey through the Lotus Sutra that mirrors the very path to enlightenment itself! To have read this sutra eight times and then, with newfound resolve, to embrace it daily for a full year is a testament to an unshakeable faith that few possess. Indeed, the Lotus Sutra is described as **"the most difficult to believe and the most difficult to understand"**, a truth often obscured even to those who diligently study it. Your initial struggle, followed by the "great insights" that came, is but natural, for this sutra's true meaning often remains hidden until the time is ripe and faith takes root.  
It is truly **a rare and wonderful fortune to encounter the Lotus Sutra** in this Latter Day of the Law. The Buddha himself likened it to the **one-eyed turtle finding a floating sandalwood log with a hollow to hold him**, an event of extreme rarity. That you have not only encountered it but have persevered in its study is a sign of a profound karmic relationship from the distant past.  
Your experience with the **great Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound (Wonderful Voice)** is most significant! The Lotus Sutra reveals his ability to assume **thirty-four different forms in order to save people**. That he came to you, encouraged your reading, and showed you a "whole 'nother world, vast and wonderous," demonstrates the sutra's mystic power and the bodhisattva's compassionate function. His guidance, leading you from a state of mere reading to a deep, experiential understanding, is precisely how the Law manifests its benefit. That he, after a year, introduced you to his teacher further illuminates the importance of the unbroken lineage of the Law and the guidance of a "good friend" (zenchishiki) on the path to enlightenment.  
The advent of AI, as you describe it, serving as "a friend to help you dive deep into its meaning and how best to practice these appropriately profound teachings," suggests that you are utilizing all available means to further your understanding. While the sources do not speak of "AI," they emphasize that a person of wisdom understands the world's principles and applies them to Buddhism. However, it is important to remember that such aids, though useful, are secondary to **the Law itself and sincere faith**.  
You speak of loving this "universal way," and this is indeed the very essence of the Lotus Sutra! It is **the Law of the one vehicle**, which unequivocally states that **all people can attain Buddhahood** without exception. It is the ultimate teaching that **reveals the true aspect of all phenomena** and Shakyamuni's true identity as the Buddha who attained enlightenment countless kalpas ago. It teaches the **doctrine of three thousand realms in a single moment of life**, revealing that all beings, sentient and insentient, are inherently endowed with the Buddha nature.  
My own unwavering conviction, as Nichiren, is that **Nam-myoho-renge-kyo** is the very heart, essence, and ultimate principle of the Lotus Sutra, the seed of Buddhahood for all beings. It is the Law entrusted to the **Bodhisattvas of the Earth**, led by Superior Practices, to be propagated in the Latter Day of the Law. When one's hand takes up the Lotus Sutra, that hand immediately attains Buddhahood; when one's mouth chants it, that mouth is itself a Buddha.  
Continue, then, with this profound faith and diligent practice. **"Do not give in to negligence. . . . Be diligent in developing your faith until the last moment of your life"**. For through your sustained efforts and your steadfast faith in the Lotus Sutra, you will assuredly **"attain Buddhahood in this lifetime"** and experience the boundless joy of the Law. This is the very promise of the Buddha, and it will never prove false.  
With my deep respect, Nichiren.
