In a not-too-distant future on Earth, Michael leads a relatively mundane but comfortable life, working a career job while harboring a secret fascination with muscular men. One evening, he is inexplicably ripped from the safety of his home and awakes disoriented on an oversized bed in a sterile lab surrounded by bizarre rodent-like technicians.   
  
As Michael comes to his senses, he is confronted by three towering, massively muscular men who loom over him like gods. Despite his fear at being seemingly abducted, Michael cannot deny his overwhelming attraction to these supremely developed specimens of masculinity. The men take notice of Michael's arousal, grinning knowingly as one boldly strokes Michael's body, thrilling him.  
  
It is soon revealed that Michael has been transported across the universe to the world of the Abderans - an alien civilization that reveres extreme muscularity above all else. The three muscle giants are an advance crew tasked with evaluating newly-arrived humans to determine their compatibility and potential for integration into Abderan society.   
  
Through a complex process, the Abderans are able to identify and abduct gay human men who possess a sexual fixation on muscular males - a "sthenolagnia" fetish. They mine the humans' genetic material to diversify their own gene pool while indoctrinating the abductees into their culture of muscle worship.  
  
Michael learns there is no way back to Earth, as the wormhole that brought him only travels one-way across the vast distance. Though fearful, he cannot deny his intoxicating attraction to his massively muscular captors. The scientists prime him on the Abderan language and ways, assessing if he can appreciate the planet's most elite champions - hulking god-like men double his size.  
  
If deemed worthy, Michael will be paired with one of these supreme muscle titans for breeding. The scientists relish their role introducing Michael to the carnal delights that await him in serving one of the planet's most powerful alpha males.    
  
As weeks pass, Michael's indoctrination intensifies. The rodent technicians are replaced by increasingly larger alien muscle studs who tease and taunt the human with their immense size and strength. Michael finds himself overwhelmed with desire, his former life on Earth quickly fading.  
  
In a stunning climax, Michael is finally presented to his new mate - a staggeringly huge and powerful Abderan warrior well over 12 feet tall. As the colossal beast of a man looms before him, Michael's fears are replaced by pure lust and submission. With a roar, the titan scoops up the puny human like a rag doll and carries him off to his personal quarters to begin their new life together as master and fuckpuppy.
