**Lyrics: **  
**[Verse 1]**  
Down by the river where the lotus grows,  
Endless-Intent came with a gift to show,  
A necklace of gems, shining bright as the dawn,  
For World-Voice who hears every cry that’s born.  
  
**[Chorus]**  
Oh, share that merit, let it roll like the tide,  
Boundless compassion, reaching far and wide,  
From the gods in the sky to the dragons below,  
A heart full of mercy makes the whole world glow.  
  
**[Verse 2]**  
World-Voice said, "No, I don’t need that shine,  
My hands are for healin’, not holdin’ what’s mine."  
But the Buddha spoke soft, with a voice so clear,  
"Take it for the lost ones, the ones livin’ in fear."  
  
**[Chorus]**  
Oh, share that merit, let it roll like the tide,  
Boundless compassion, reaching far and wide,  
From the gods in the sky to the dragons below,  
A heart full of mercy makes the whole world glow.  
  
**[Bridge]**  
He split that treasure, two halves in his hands,  
One for the Buddha, one for the timeless land,  
No greed in his soul, just a gift to send,  
A circle of kindness that’ll never end.  
  
**[Verse 3]**  
For the monks and the nuns, for the folks on the way,  
For the spirits that dance at the end of the day,  
Yakshas and garudas, kinnaras sing,  
Every livin’ thing caught in samsara’s sting.  
  
**[Chorus]**  
Oh, share that merit, let it roll like the tide,  
Boundless compassion, reaching far and wide,  
From the gods in the sky to the dragons below,  
A heart full of mercy makes the whole world glow.  
  
**[Outro]**  
So sing me a sutra, let the verses unwind,  
Of a necklace that frees every troubled mind,  
Through the dust and the blues, let the story be told,  
Boundless merit shines like a river of gold.
