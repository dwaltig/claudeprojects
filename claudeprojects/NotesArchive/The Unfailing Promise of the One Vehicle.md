# The Unfailing Promise of the One Vehicle  
  
The Lotus Sūtra's **One Vehicle**, grand and clear,   
Unveils **universal enlightenment**, dispelling fear.   
No separate paths, but **skillful means** they seem,   
A single journey, born of Buddha's ancient dream.  
  
A **Phantom City**, conjured for the weary soul,   
A temporary rest, before the ultimate goal.   
The **Treasure Land** beyond, the true and final aim,   
Where **Anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi** lights the flame.  
  
Through ages vast, a **beginningless bond** was sown,   
By Great-Universal-Wisdom, His truth made known.   
Now **believe**, **uphold**, and **slander not** this Way,   
For inherent **Buddha-nature** brightens every day.  
  
Tiantai's wisdom: **"phantom city is treasure land"**,   
**"Three thousand realms"** in moments, close at hand.   
Nichiren chants the **Daimoku**, bold and free,   
**"Changing poison into medicine,"** for all to see.  
  
Not distant pure lands, nor just emptiness alone,   
But **this world's suffering**, where Buddha's seeds are sown.   
**Empowerment** within, for every soul to claim,   
The **unfailing promise**, burning like a sacred flame**.**
