# The Sculptor's Hand  
  
The seeds of goodness we must sow,   
In fertile fields of heart and mind,   
Where kindness, compassion gently grow,   
And leave all selfishness behind.  
  
With every thought, and word, and deed,   
We shape the world in which we dwell,   
A tapestry of choices, a creed,   
That weaves a heaven or a hell.  
  
For character, a sturdy frame,   
Upholds the virtues we hold dear,   
Integrity, a shining flame,   
That guides us through the doubt and fear.  
  
Our actions, like the sculptor's hand,   
Molding the future, day by day,   
Building a better, stronger land,   
Where peace and justice hold their sway.  
  
Let empathy our compass be,   
To understand another's plight,   
And share the bonds of unity,   
In every struggle, wrong, and right.  
  
For in this tapestry of life,   
We're threads entwined, a vibrant whole,   
Each soul contributing to the strife,   
To reach a higher, nobler goal.  
  
So let us choose with open eyes,   
The path of virtue, love, and grace,   
And build a world where goodness lies,   
Reflected in each heart and face.
