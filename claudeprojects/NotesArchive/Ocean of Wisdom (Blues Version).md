# Ocean of Wisdom (Blues Version)  
  
[**Verse 1**] In a sea of thoughts, I drift alone Searchin' for the truth in that great unknown Deep, deep waters, can't see a thing Wisdom's hidden where the shadows sting  
  
[**Verse 2**] You think you know, but you ain’t close The ocean’s secrets are the ones that hurt the most Dive down low, let the shadows sway Peace waits down there, but you might lose your way  
  
[**Chorus**] Buddha’s wisdom, so deep and wide An endless ocean, where I can’t hide Tides are pullin', they come and go Outta reach, but still we know  
  
[**Verse 3**] In the quiet deep, where the stillness reigns Wisdom sleeps, and it don't explain Songs from old times start to ring Truths they echo, like the blues they bring  
  
[**Verse 4**] Floatin’ on the currents of the wise Stars are flickerin' in these tired eyes As wide as the sky and twice as fast Past the future, yeah, beyond the past  
  
[**Chorus**] Buddha’s wisdom, so deep and wide An endless ocean, where I can’t hide Tides are pullin', they come and go Outta reach, but still we know
