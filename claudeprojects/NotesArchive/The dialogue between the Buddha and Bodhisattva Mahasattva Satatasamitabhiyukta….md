  
The dialogue between the Buddha and Bodhisattva Mahasattva Satatasamitabhiyukta emphasizes the significance of preserving, reading, teaching, and writing the Lotus Sutra by emphasizing the immense merit and spiritual rewards that come with doing so. The Buddha tells the Bodhisattva that anyone who preserves, reads, teaches, or writes the Sutra will gain extraordinary qualities, including eight hundred fine traits of the eye, twelve hundred of the ear, eight hundred of the nose, twelve hundred of the tongue, eight hundred of the body, and twelve hundred of the mind. These many hundreds of fine traits will fully perfect these six senses, representing a profound spiritual awakening and understanding of the interconnectedness of all life.  
The Buddha also tells the Bodhisattva that those who write down and treasure the Sutra will be on a path of immense goodness and spiritually touched by countless Buddhas. He further emphasizes the importance of teaching the Sutra, saying that those who do so will be likening themselves to a wise young man or young lady of good family who is respected and revered by all.  
The Bodhisattva Mahasattva Satatasamitabhiyukta is so moved by the Buddha's words that he vows to uphold and disseminate the teachings of the Lotus Sutra, even in the face of persecution and slander. He knows that the Sutra is a precious gift that has the power to transform lives and bring about enlightenment.
