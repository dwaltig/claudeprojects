A lone figure meditating peacefully on a serene mountaintop at dawn, soft golden light illuminating the landscape. The mountain stands strong and resilient against the subtle signs of a recent storm. An invisible, golden aura surrounds the figure, representing the armor of endurance. A single lotus flower blooms serenely in the foreground. Subtle radial patterns in the sky hint at the Dharma wheel. Serene realism, spiritual art, symbolic illustration.
