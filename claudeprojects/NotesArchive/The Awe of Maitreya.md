# The Awe of Maitreya  
  
The Awe of Maitreya is a contemplative folk song inspired by the first chapter of the Lotus Sutra. It tells the story of the Bodhisattva Maitreya, who stands in awe before the Buddha's miraculous display of light and wisdom. As Maitreya witnesses the profound and wondrous events unfolding while the Buddha is deep in meditation, the song explores themes of reverence, curiosity, and the search for enlightenment.  
  
With a blend of guitar, piano, bass, and drums, the music captures the mystical atmosphere and the deep spiritual awakening that Maitreya experiences. This song invites listeners to join in the journey of understanding the boundless wisdom of the Buddha, reflecting on the awe and wonder that such profound teachings inspire.

**The Awe of Maitreya**  
  
*(Verse 1)* In the stillness of the night, the Buddha sat so deep, A light shone from his heart, and all the world did keep. Maitreya, full of wonder, gazed upon the sight, He marveled at the power, in the silent night.  
*(Verse 1)* In the stillness of the night, the Buddha sat so deep, A light shone from his heart, and all the world did keep. Maitreya, full of wonder, gazed upon the sight, He marveled at the power, in the silent night.  
  
*(Chorus)* Oh, what is this miracle, this light so pure and true? The Tathāgata’s power, shines the whole world through. With hearts full of questions, we turn to wisdom’s flame, To Mañjuśrī, the wise one, we call his holy name.  
*(Chorus)* Oh, what is this miracle, this light so pure and true? The Tathāgata’s power, shines the whole world through. With hearts full of questions, we turn to wisdom’s flame, To Mañjuśrī, the wise one, we call his holy name.  
  
*(Verse 2)* Eighteen thousand lands did glow, in beauty all adorned, Maitreya’s heart was stirred, as thoughts of truth were born. “What causes this great wonder, while the Lord does meditate? What secrets lie in silence, behind this shining gate?”

*(Bridge)* The gods and all the beings, they stood in silent awe, From earth to sky they pondered, the truth in what they saw. Maitreya, with his reverence, sought answers from the wise, The seeds of understanding, beneath the Buddha’s skies.

*(Verse 3)* “Mañjuśrī, prince of wisdom, you’ve seen the Buddhas past, You’ve walked with ancient truths, in realms so deep and vast. Tell us of this radiance, this miracle we see, Unravel all the mystery, and set our spirits free.”

*(Outro)* So in the light of wisdom, their journey did begin, Maitreya sought the answers, with hope that lay within. And as the night grew deeper, the truth would soon be known, The path of understanding, in every heart was sown.
