# Transcendent Power Blues  
# Transcendent Power Blues  
  
*"Transcendent Power Blues" is a soulful blend of blues and folk, inspired by Chapter 21 of the Lotus Sutra. This song captures the profound spiritual essence of the Buddha’s teachings, focusing on the boundless reach of the Dharma and the eternal commitment of Bodhisattvas to spread enlightenment. Set against the backdrop of a serene creek valley with Mount Hood in the distance, the lyrics evoke a cosmic connection between the natural world and the divine. The chorus plays on the term "Tathāgatas," which refers to enlightened beings, specifically the Buddhas, who have fully realized the truth and come from and gone to the ultimate reality. This wordplay is reflected in the interchange of "Thus Gone Ones" and "Thus Come Ones," highlighting the timeless nature of enlightenment. With deep, resonant vocals and a rich instrumental arrangement, the song weaves together themes of reverence, awakening, and the universal power of the Buddhas. The golden tongues of light from lotus blossoms symbolize the spread of wisdom and compassion, creating a harmonious balance between earthly beauty and spiritual transcendence. "Transcendent Power Blues" is a journey through time and space, inviting listeners to connect deeply with the Dharma and the timeless teachings of the Buddha.*

From distant lands,   
From distant lands,   
they threw their offerings high,  
While we remain,   
While we remain,   
hands joined in reverence low.  
A canopy of love,   
A canopy of love,   
hanging over this world’s view,  
For the Lord and his great law,   
For the Lord and his great law,   
we sing our praises too.

it’s sacred, holy ground.  
Where the Dharma lives,   
Where the Dharma lives,   
the Buddha’s here to stay,  
Erect a shrine, light a flame,   
Erect a shrine, light a flame,   
in honor of the way.
