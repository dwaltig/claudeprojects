(Verse 1)  
Many seekers on the path, so many ways to go,  
The Buddha’s wisdom reaches far, more than we can know.  
A kalpa’s just a moment in the endless stream of time,  
His teachings touch so many, in rhythm and in rhyme.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, we can’t predict, we can’t foresee,  
Who’ll join us in this journey, who’ll find the key.  
But we keep on walkin’, with hearts so true,  
In the Buddha’s light, we see it through.  
  
(Verse 2)  
From all walks of life, they come to hear the call,  
In the shadow of the burning house, where illusions fall.  
The vow we take as Bodhisattvas, to help each soul we find,  
To guide them to the truth, and ease their troubled mind.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, we can’t predict, we can’t foresee,  
Who’ll join us in this journey, who’ll find the key.  
But we keep on walkin’, with hearts so true,  
In the Buddha’s light, we see it through.  
In the Buddha’s light, we see it through.

(Bridge)  
It don’t matter where you’re from, or what you’ve done before,  
The path to enlightenment opens every door.  
With compassion in our hearts, we reach out with our hands,  
Together we can walk, through these sacred lands.  
  
(Verse 3)  
So remember this truth, as you walk along the way,  
Every soul’s got the chance, to see the light of day.  
Maintain your vow, with a heart that’s wide,  
In the service of all beings, let compassion be your guide.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, we can’t predict, we can’t foresee,  
Who’ll join us in this journey, who’ll find the key.  
But we keep on walkin’, with hearts so true,  
In the Buddha’s light, we see it through.  
  
(Outro)  
From the old to the young, the rich to the poor,  
The Buddha’s wisdom welcomes all, and so much more.  
With the vow of Bodhisattvas, we stand and we sing,  
In the endless journey, to enlightenment we bring.
