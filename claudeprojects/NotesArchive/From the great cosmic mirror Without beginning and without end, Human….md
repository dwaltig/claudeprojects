From the great cosmic mirror Without beginning and without end, Human society became manifest. At that time liberation and confusion arose. When fear and doubt occurred Toward the confidence which is primordially free, Countless multitudes of cowards arose. When the confidence which is primordially free Was followed and delighted in, Countless multitudes of warriors arose. Those countless multitudes of cowards Hid themselves in caves and jungles. They killed their brothers and sisters and ate their flesh, They followed the example of beasts, They provoked terror in each other; Thus they took their own lives. They kindled a great fire of hatred, They constantly roiled the river of lust, They wallowed in the mud of laziness: The age of famine and plague arose. Of those who were dedicated to the primordial confidence, The many hosts of warriors, Some went to highland mountains And erected beautiful castles of crystal. Some went to the lands of beautiful lakes and islands And erected lovely palaces. Some went to the pleasant plains And sowed fields of barley, rice, and wheat. They were always without quarrel, Ever loving and very generous. Without encouragement, through their self-existing inscrutability, They were always devoted to the Imperial Rigden.
