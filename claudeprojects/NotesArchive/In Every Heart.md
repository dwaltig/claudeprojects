Verse]  
In teachings shared we learn to see  
Harsh words just fade like fallen leaves  
Respect for wise ones earnestly  
In every heart find sweet reprieves  
  
[Verse 2]  
Don't sow the seeds of others' faults  
Let every word raise spirits high  
In gentle kindness  
Truth exalts  
In every heart let love apply  
  
[Chorus]  
Speak not of merits or the flaws  
Lift up the heavy  
Mend the torn  
Let gentle whispers be our laws  
In every heart let peace be born  
  
[Bridge]  
No hostile feelings find a home  
In peaceful ways let spirits thrive  
With open hearts through wisdom roam  
In every heart let love arrive  
  
[Verse 3]  
Release the grip of bitter ties  
In every soul a light does gleam  
Through compassion darkness flies  
In every heart let kindness stream  
  
[Chorus]  
Speak not of merits or the flaws  
Lift up the heavy  
Mend the torn  
Let gentle whispers be our laws  
In every heart let peace be born
