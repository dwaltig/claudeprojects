For a homeschooled student enrolled full-time in the TTU K-12 program, attendance requirements are as follows:  
  
- **Regular Completion of Assignments**: Attendance is measured by regular completion of assignments, not by physical presence.  
- **Weekly Requirements**: Students must complete a minimum of 5% of course assignments every seven days.  
- **Three-Day Minimum**: Attendance is required at least three days per week.  
- **Course Credit**: Full course completion within six months from the date of enrollment is required for credit, with no partial credit granted.  
- **Concurrent Enrollment**: Students must be enrolled in at least four courses concurrently to remain in the program.  
- **Truancy Process**: Failure to meet these requirements may lead to truancy proceedings and possible removal from the program [oai_citation:1,TTU K-12 Policies | TTU K-12  | TTU](https://www.depts.ttu.edu/k12/support/policies.php).
