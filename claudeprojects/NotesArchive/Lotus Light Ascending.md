# Lotus Light Ascending  
  
From **Lotus Sūtra's** heart, a mystic call   
In **Chapter Nineteen**, gifts unfold for all.   
For **Upholders** true, a path begins** **  
Where **Dharma's** light, pure wisdom wins.  
  
Through **five training methods**, deeply sown** **  
**Acceptance, reading**, truth is known.   
**Recitation's** **echoes**, clear and deep** **  
**Commentary's** **voice**, secrets to keep.   
And **penmanship**, the teaching's flight** **  
A practice firm, for inner light.  
  
Then **ROKKONSHOUJOU**, senses pure and bright** **  
A cleansing deep, bathing all in light**. **   
**Not intellectual**, no complex creed** **  
But **sincere practice**, plants **liberation's seed**.  
  
The **eyes become clear**, perceiving wide** **  
Across **one thousand million worlds**, they glide.   
See **beings' karmas**, their future's thread** **  
What's hidden from others, now plainly read.  
  
The **ears hear all sounds**, a cosmic hum** **  
From deep **Avici hell** to **Summit of Being** come**. **  
No attachment clings, no sound's concealed** **  
Through **natural ears**, the world's revealed.  
  
The **purified nose**, scents it discerns** **  
Of thoughts and beings, as wisdom learns.   
The **tongue** makes flavors "heavenly dew"** **  
Preaching **correct Law**, forever new.  
  
The **body, pure as lapis**, shines afar** **  
Reflecting **Sumeru-worlds**, like a star**. **  
All forms and realms, within its sphere** **  
A microcosm, bringing truth so near.  
  
The **mind, free from fear**, understands all** **  
From a single verse, vast principles enthrall**. **  
Knows **living beings' minds**, their every phase** **  
Their thoughts and words, in wondrous ways.  
  
Though **wisdom-without-āsravas** isn't yet won  
This deep purification has begun.   
A progressive path, clear and profound** **  
Where tangible merits can be found.  
  
By **Odaimoku's** chant, a simple sound** **  
**Bodhisattva-nature** truly found.   
For **compassionate action**, the purpose lies   
To lift all suffering, beneath vast skies**.**
