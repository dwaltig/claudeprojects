This song is a soulful and spiritual journey inspired by Chapter 24 of the Lotus Sutra, celebrating the wisdom and compassion of Bodhisattva *Wonderful Sound* (also known to me as *Faltering Voice*). With heartfelt male vocals, rich gospel choir harmonies, and a blend of acoustic and slide guitar, cello, stand-up bass, and drum kit, this piece transcends genres to bring a sense of universal connection and enlightenment.

Lyrics:   
**Verse 1:**  
**Verse 1:**  
From a distant world adorned in light,  
A bodhisattva takes his flight,  
Wonderful Sound, with voice so grand,  
Travels to the Buddha’s land.  
Through skies and stars, he makes his way,  
Bringing Dharma’s light of day.  
With every step, a flower falls,  
A universe in his call.  
  
**Chorus:**  
**Chorus:**  
Oh, Wonderful Sound, with a heart so pure,  
Transforming forms, forever sure,  
Bringing wisdom to every shore,  
Teaching love and so much more.  
  
**Verse 2:**  
**Verse 2:**  
In this Sahā world, he came to see,  
In this Sahā world, he came to see,  
In this Sahā world, he came to see,  
The Buddha teaching by the sea,  
With hands together, he bowed down low,  
His presence caused the winds to blow.  
He spoke not words but with his sight,  
Showed us realms beyond our night.  
His light shone bright, his spirit vast,  
A bridge from present to the past.  
  
**Chorus:**  
**Chorus:**  
Oh, Wonderful Sound, with a thousand forms,  
Healing hearts through all life’s storms,  
Spreading peace across the lands,  
Guiding us with gentle hands.  
  
**Bridge:**  
**Bridge:**  
He can be a king or a humble sage,  
A woman, a child, or a golden age,  
In every guise, he plays his part,  
Bringing Dharma from his heart.  
  
**Verse 3:**  
**Verse 3:**  
To each who suffer, to those in need,  
He appears in the form they heed,  
As gods and dragons, men, and beasts,  
He offers the Dharma’s feast.  
He travels worlds with just a thought,  
To share the truths the Buddha taught,  
A promise of a future bright,  
When all will live in Buddha’s light.  
  
**Chorus:**  
**Chorus:**  
Oh, Wonderful Sound, so brave and wise,  
A star that never fades or dies,  
In every echo, in every breeze,  
He’s the whisper in the trees.  
  
**Outro:**  
**Outro:**  
Returning to his distant home,  
He leaves us not to be alone,  
For in his silence and his song,  
We find the strength to carry on.  
Wonderful Sound, forever near,  
Teaching us with love and cheer.
