[Verse]  
Searing pain  
Deep inside my soul  
Lost inside this darkness  
That I cannot control  
So held back by this fire,  
inside my beating heart  
What else can I do  
when my world falls apart  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
In this place,  
I drown in my tears,  
My fears,  
My god, what have I done  
  
[Chorus]  
In this place,  
I wade.  
In the pain.  
No gain.  
Nothing ventured, nothing won.  
But I have my fun  
You say I don't see it  
Maybe I just need new eyes.  
Because the hardest thing to see  
Is when you need to say goodbye  
  
[Verse]  
Waiting here  
And I cannot go home  
Until I find my demons  
Wherever they may roam  
Something deep inside  
like stealing your regrets  
Drowning is the easy part  
if they haven't got you yet  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
In this place,  
I drown in my tears,  
My fears,  
My god, what have I done  
  
[Chorus]  
In this place,  
I wade.  
In the pain.  
No gain.  
Nothing ventured, nothing won.  
But I have my fun  
You say I don't see it  
Maybe I just need new eyes.  
Because the hardest thing to see  
Is when you need to say goodbye

[Pre-Chorus]  
In this place,  
I drown in my tears,  
My fears,  
My god, what have I done  
  
[Chorus]  
In this place,  
I wade.  
In the pain.  
No gain.  
Nothing ventured, nothing won.  
But I have my fun  
You say I don't see it  
Maybe I just need new eyes.  
Because the hardest thing to see  
Is when you need to say goodbye  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh, Oh, Oh,  
My god, what have I done  
Oh  
Nothing won  
Oh, Oh, Oh,  
My god, what have I done  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
In this place,  
I drown in my tears,  
My fears,  
My god, what have I done  
  
[Outro]  
In this place,  
I wade.  
In the pain.  
No gain.  
Nothing ventured, nothing won.  
But I have my fun  
You say I don't see it  
Maybe I just need new eyes.  
Because the hardest thing to see  
Is when you need to say goodbye
