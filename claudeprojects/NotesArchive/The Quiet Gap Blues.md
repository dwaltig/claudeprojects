# *The Quiet Gap Blues*  
*The Quiet Gap Blues* is a slow-burning, porch-born folk-blues meditation on patience, presence, and the subtle work of transformation. Over finger-picked guitar and a harmonica’s gentle cry, William sings of that moment between impulse and wisdom—the breath before the word, the silence before the song. It’s a hymn to building one’s inner tower stone by stone, listening deeply to others’ worlds, and letting the Dharma shine in everyday gestures. Intimate and earthy, this track invites you to walk it slow and let the quiet do its holy work.

Verse 1 – The Micro-Pause  
  
(Am)  
I got a river of insight, runnin’ deep and wide,  
(G)  
But it rushes past the door where my quick words hide.  
(F)  
One breath could hold the whole wide vow,  
(E7)  
But I keep forgettin’—I remember now.  
  
Chorus – Walk It Slow  
(C)  
Take a step, let the silence lead,  
(G)  
Let the vow breathe through every deed.  
(F)  
Not just in the songs I play,  
(E7)  
But in the way I speak each day.

Verse 2 – Many Seeds, One Tower  
  
(Am)  
I’m scatterin’ seeds on a thousand hills,  
(G)  
Dreamin’ of towers and iron wills.  
(F)  
But a treasure’s built stone by stone,  
(E7)  
Can’t grow ten forests if you’ve got one home.

Verse 3 – Deep Listenin’  
  
(Am)  
Some folks talk of skies I’ve never seen,  
(G)  
Different colors, same moonbeam.

I’ll ask their hearts how the heavens show,  
(E7)  
Learn the song only questions know.

Bridge – The Body Gate  
  
(Dm)  
Hands on the fretboard, breath in my chest,  
(Am)  
This body’s a temple where vows find rest.  
(F)  
Every muscle a mantra, every step a prayer,  
(E7)  
The Dharma’s not distant—it’s beating right there.

Chorus – Walk It Slow (reprise)  
  
(C)  
Take a step, let the silence lead,  
(G)  
Let the vow breathe through every deed.  
(F)  
Patience hums like an old steel string,  
(E7)  
That’s the deepest truth I sing.
