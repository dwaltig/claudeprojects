Verse 1 (The Burden of Time)  
I walked the **horizontal line** for time I cannot say, A hundred thousand eons, friend, just scraping through the day. I practiced patience (*kṣānti*), good conduct (*śīla*), and I tried to make the offering, Tried to climb up to the heavens, dodging the contempt the arrogant would bring. I gave up all my treasures, kept my conduct sharp and pure, For **eight hundred thousand million *nayutas* of *kalpas***, just trying to endure.  
Verse 2 (The Cost of Brick and Stone)  
Verse 2 (The Cost of Brick and Stone)  
They said you gotta build a monument, pile up the jeweled stone, A magnificent **stūpa** where the Buddha’s relics are known. They said you gotta found a **monastery**, put the finest wood in the door, Make the **four kinds of offerings** so the Saṃgha can survive and soar. I spent my life just counting beads, watching the hourglass run, Tried to find the finish line before the setting of the sun.  
Chorus (The Vertical Leap)  
But that long road, it don't compare, no, not even a **hundredth part**, To the **vertical leap** I made when the truth hit my heart. I heard that sound, the **eternal reality**, and I believed it on the spot, **In the depths of my mind, I believed for one instant, that's all I got!**. That single thought, it burned away the ages I had sought.  
Verse 3 (The Revelation)  
Verse 3 (The Revelation)  
They taught me the Buddha passed, vanished into the air, That the Master walked and suffered, and left us nothing there. But the voice came forth from the timeless deep, singing truth for the weary soul, Said, **"That historical life was a skillful means (*upāya*), a story to make you whole"**. He said, "I attained it ages back, I’ve been **ever-present** right here, You don't chase me in the future, child, I'm already standing near."

Bridge (The Immediate Gain)  
No more regression, friend, that promise is mine today, Got **Patience with Non-production**, casting all my doubt away. I bypassed all the eons, threw the calculation far, I got assurance of enlightenment, leaping over every star. 'Cause I realized the true essence, and I held it in my hand, My **single moment of faith** surpassed the sands of every land.

Outro (Resolution)  
You can pile up your bricks, you can light your lamp, but I already paid the toll, 'Cause I have been **guaranteed** the supreme path right here in my soul. Oh, I took the vertical leap, yes, I took the vertical leap, All my infinite striving fell asleep.
