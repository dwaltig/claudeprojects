Verse 1:  
Sun and moon shine equally bright  
On every soul, day and night  
Tathagata's wisdom grand  
Guides all beings across the land  
  
Chorus:  
One true path, not three  
To set our spirits free  
From ignorance we spin  
'Til wisdom dawns within  
  
Verse 2:  
Like a blind man gaining sight  
We learn to see beyond our plight  
The doctor's herbs, the Buddha's way  
Open our eyes to a brand new day  
  
Chorus:  
One true path, not three  
To set our spirits free  
From ignorance we spin  
'Til wisdom dawns within  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
Bridge:  
In the wilderness we'll find  
Transcendent faculties of mind  
The world a dream, a phantom stream  
Unborn, undying, or so it seems  
  
Final Chorus:  
One true path, not three  
To set our spirits free  
All is void, all laws the same  
Beyond all light, beyond all name
