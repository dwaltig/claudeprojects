***I discovered the Way. He has opened the Way. I will expound what I’ve learned along the Way. Gods, men and asuras! Come and hear the Dharma!***  
  
**“Walking the Way (Revised Draft)”**  
  
**[Verse 1]**  
**In the glow of neon nights, a spark lit my sky,**  
**A silent whisper from legends that never die.**  
**He revealed the light—not just in myth or lore,**  
**But in the pulse of the pavement and every open door.**  
**Like a river weaving through concrete and dreams,**  
**Where ancient voices merge with our modern themes,**  
**I found the Way in the quiet beat of my heart,**  
**A journey of wonder where every end restarts.**  
  
**[Chorus]**  
**Listen to the Dharma as it rolls like a storm,**  
**From ancient stone temples to the city’s modern form.**  
**Every heartbeat questions, every step dares to confide—**  
**In the clash of doubt and faith, we walk side by side.**  
  
**[Verse 2]**  
**Through deserts of despair and forests of tender hope,**  
**Where every tear carves a canyon and helps us learn to cope,**  
**I’ve felt the tremor of my soul in restless nights—**  
**A paradox where darkness births our most brilliant lights.**  
**Have you risked your truth, let your guarded walls fall?**  
**In every scar, a story that connects us all.**  
**Amid the chaos of the urban maze and quiet inner strife,**  
**Our struggles paint the map of our resilient, living life.**  
  
**[Bridge]**  
**In the haze where shadow meets the early dawn,**  
**The lotus blooms—like a wildflower on cracked concrete drawn.**  
**Neon signs and pixel dreams light a pathway so surreal,**  
**A bridge of stars inviting us to question what is real.**  
  
**[Verse 3]**  
**Lightning cracks the midnight sky in a dance of fierce delight,**  
**Storms rage with questions, yet truth refuses to take flight.**  
**What if our deepest doubt is where the brightest sparks arise?**  
**Between each flash, the shadows whisper their quiet replies.**  
**In every trial and every pulse of the restless night,**  
**The lotus of our spirit blossoms—defiant, bold, and bright.**  
**So dare to challenge, to wonder, and to ignite**  
**A journey where each step transforms darkness into light.**  
  
**[Outro]**  
**Footsteps echo in the corridors of time’s endless song,**  
**The Way remains eternal—even if the road feels long.**  
**With every breath, an ancient truth is softly retold—**  
**In the fire of our questions, the truth shines brave and bold.**
