# Website Updates:   
  
Can weImprove the chapters’ verse sections?  
**Maybe** wrap every single verse line in its own <p class="verse-line"> tag.   
  
I want the website to have the feeling of “3000 realms in a moment's thought”  
So, how do we build this "interrelated feeling" in HTML? We move from *pages* to *nodes* and *links*.  
**1. The "Pop-up" / Hover Method (Simple)**  
**2. The "Hyper-linked Concept" Method (Powerful)**  
**3. The "Multi-Panel Study" Layout (Advanced)**  
  
Example:   

| Panel 1: The Sutra | Panel 2: Your Notes | Panel 3: Related Themes |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| (Chapter 2: Verse 1)

"Shariputra, you should know... | (Scholarly Note on 2.1)

"Here, the Buddha's use of 'should know' implies..." | (Related Concepts in 2.1)

<li><a href="#">Consciousness</a></li> <li><a href="#">Psychology</a></li> |
| (Chapter 2: Verse 2)

"All Buddhas come to this world..." | (This panel is empty) | (This panel is empty) |
  
Thus illuminating the text from many angles at once.  
  
I would like to incorporate the classic UI pattern called an **"Accordion"** or **"Collapsible Content."**  
This is much better than making them scroll past pages and pages of text they might not be interested in at that moment.  
  
Fix the em-dashes. I see and extra space before them.   
  
We want to help the user gain access to the data from the superscripts. What’s the best way?   
  
Have an agent update the 02_Blues_Interpretation_Narration_Master file. We need the agent to meticulously insert the reference markers (e.g., [1]) into the **Blues** translation text at semantically equivalent points to where they appear in the Standard text. This allows the existing "Note" functionality to work seamlessly across both versions.
