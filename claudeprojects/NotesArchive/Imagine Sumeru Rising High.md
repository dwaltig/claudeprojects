imagine sumeru rising high   
a cosmic pillar in the sky   
up where no mortal eye can reach   
a lone steel needle pins the peak  
  
and from a distant mountain rim   
a wind-tossed thread lies paper-thin  
  
myoh hoh wren gay kyoh  we sing   
  
a treasure greater than a king   
harder than threading steel in storm   
yet here inside our chests it's warm   
myoh hoh wren gay kyoh  ring true   
the mystic law will see us through  
  
nichiren wrote for hearts in doubt   
your finest triumphs fade without   
the lotus blooming in your soul   
its petals make the broken whole  
  
we chase the world forget the grace   
but fortune’s shining in this place  
  
myoh hoh wren gay kyoh  we sing   
a treasure greater than a king   
harder than threading steel in storm   
yet here inside our chests it's warm   
myoh hoh wren gay kyoh  we sing   
  
the mystic law will see us through  
  
needle waits on icy stone   
wind keeps howling all alone   
gates of dharma sealed for ages   
open now across the pages  
  
myoh hoh wren gay kyoh  we sing   
  
a treasure greater than a king   
harder than threading steel in storm   
yet here inside our chests it's warm   
myoh hoh wren gay kyoh   ring true   
the mystic law will see us through
