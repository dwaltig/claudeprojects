Lyrics:   Yo, check the mic, one two  
**Verse 1** Ignorant minds throwin' shade my way Words like daggers, cuttin' deep, day by day Threats and disses, tryin' to shake my soul But I'm standin' tall, takin' control  
**Verse 2** Hatin' hard, they comin' with the spite Sticks and stones, yeah, they ready to fight But I ain't scared, nah, I'm holdin' my ground Courage risin', with every sound  
**Chorus** Words may bruise, yeah, the swords may clash But I'm unbreakable, built to last Through the storms, through the fire's blaze I'm risin' up, with strength and amaze  
**Verse 3** Venom spittin', in every single line Tryin' to silence this voice of mine But I ain't fazed by their lies and deceit I'm reachin' for the sky, can't be beat  
**Bridge** Absorbin' the hate, they throwin' my way Each blow a seed, for a brighter day From the shadows deep, I emerge anew Like a phoenix risin', flames burnin' blue  
**Chorus** Words may bruise, yeah, the swords may clash But I'm unbreakable, built to last Through the storms, through the fire's blaze I'm risin' up, with strength and amaze
