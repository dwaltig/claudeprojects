# Joy  
  
I learned a long time ago, The joy we find in learning the TRUTH (as it is) is different from what we experience when our desires are satisfied. It is a joy we can learn to find at the heart of everything we think, say and do. Joy is not something that needs to be added to ones life. It is what we find remaining when we let go of our attachments and delusions.
