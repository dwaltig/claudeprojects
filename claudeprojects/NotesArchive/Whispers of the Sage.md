**[Verse 1]**  
Unlock the mystery, wisdom’s key, no guarantee  
See the truth in every law, that’s how it’s gotta be  
No fame, no name, still I’m feelin’ free  
Unbound by the world, but the world’s all I see  
  
**[Verse 2]**  
Light or dark, I’m walkin’ steady through the fight  
True rest, I’m blessed, beyond the sleepless nights  
No flag, no claims, I ain’t here for the hype  
Findin’ peace in the streets, where we all crave the light  
  
**[Chorus]**  
Sage in the wind, hear the sound of truth  
Wisdom whispers, they be callin’ out to you  
Beyond the hustle, every game they make us play  
Feel the light come, and it’s chasin’ night away  
  
**[Verse 3]**  
Unlit paths, walkin’ with that ease  
Maps don’t guide me through these traps, believe  
Got a silent guide inside, showin’ me the moves  
Stand apart, walk smart, never gotta prove  
  
**[Bridge]**  
Storms come, but I’m still standin’ calm  
Life bends, I’m flexin’, that’s the inner balm  
No throne, no crown, I don’t need the reign  
Breakin’ chains, bring the change, that’s the game I claim  
  
**[Chorus]**  
Sage in the wind, hear the sound of truth  
Wisdom whispers, they be callin’ out to you  
Beyond the hustle, every game they make us play  
Feel the light come, and it’s chasin’ night away
