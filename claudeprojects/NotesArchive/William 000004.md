  
William 00:00:04  
so I got this cool recorder so go ahead and tell me how you were gonna what.  
Lawrence 00:00:23  
you're describing as the bit what we decided on to probably use like two trucks all right get if you want to eight inches thick you're gonna get about 400 square feet which is about 20 by 20 approximately now we also talked about making the actual dumpster pad at 4500 PS concrete that probably only.  
Lawrence 00:00:54  
needs to be about six inches so we can gain a little bit here that's why when I put in a bit it says, Approximately 20 by 24. We're going to use up 10 yards. I'll stretch it out. I'll move the form back to where it needs to be. So we want it most cost effective. And the most cost effective is going. We don't want to pour good concrete over there and leave trash in between good concrete. Because that makes it hard to tear out. And more things happen. And, yeah. So we need.  
Lawrence 00:01:26  
It'll be about 40 by 40. Eight inches thick. Approximately. I might get a 50 out of the 40. You know what I'm saying? 50 by 40. Because that's six inches. And we'll stretch it on up. It'll all be reinforced concrete. 4,500 PSI. Reinforced with steel. One foot on centers. And I do believe to the drain right here. Okay, so just because it's cracked doesn't mean it's not good.  
Lawrence 00:01:57  
This has got rebar in it. I'm pretty sure. here when they did this um this definitely needs i mean we just take it from there and cut it back here okay and then that way we'll get rid of all the crack and i'll put the joints where they're supposed to go because this is good concrete i know as i can tell by the way it is it just didn't get jointed right that's why it's breaking up like i can't believe they didn't joint this at all i can't believe we have enough more cracks right there sorry i don't mean to run your time all.  
Lawrence 00:02:27  
right so yeah and what it'll be is 24 this way right no no it's 20 that way i think yeah it's 20 that way and 24 this way it's 24 here this mark the price on the defense is the same 70 of foot the same as i'm pouring over here i'll be building the same thing it's the same deal um so.  
Lawrence 00:03:00  
approximately 40 foot if I'm not mistaken that's like 12 or 18 that's like 12 and then the one the three panels over there make up for the 40 it's like one's 12 one's 18 and one's 15 whatever it is the three all together it's a total of 40 so $2,800 in fence building for it to match whatever fence they fucking wanted to match me at mine or theirs I think that's it.  
Lawrence 00:03:41  
these are just notes are they yep
