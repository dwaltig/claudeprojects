# Undaunted Forevermore  
  
In changing times, uncertain, vast,  
The path ahead unclear, uncast,  
Yet still the heart remains steadfast—  
The Lotus blooms, undaunted, fast.  
  
Though future minds may harbor doubt,  
Negativity spreads about,  
The Dharma’s truth we still must shout,  
Our faith unwavering, devout.  
  
Encouraged by the Sutra’s voice,  
To persevere becomes our choice,  
Protected, held, we can rejoice—  
In steadfastness, our hearts rejoice.  
  
“In times to come,” the Sutra sings,  
“Courage the Bodhisattva brings,”  
To share the wisdom Dharma springs,  
With fearless grace, our spirit wings.  
  
So through each storm, we rise once more,  
Steady at heart, as waves endure,  
Committed ever to this lore—  
Undaunted, unabashed, forevermore.
