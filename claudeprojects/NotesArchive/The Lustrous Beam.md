In the realm of Manifestation  
Where spirits rise and fall  
Kassapa sought liberation  
Heeding wisdom's call

He walked a lonesome highway  
'Neath countless starry skies  
'Til he shone like the Lustrous Beam  
A beacon for our eyes

Thirty billion sages he met  
Their teachings filled his heart  
'Til the truth within him was set  
To play his destined part

'Neath countless starry skies  
'Til he shone like the Lustrous Beam

In a realm of lapis lazuli  
Where gem trees sweetly bloom  
He built a haven for the weary  
Banishing doubt and gloom

He walked a lonesome highway  
'Neath countless starry skies  
'Til he shone like the Lustrous Beam  
A beacon for our eyes

Though Mara's shadows may linger  
And temptation's whispers rise  
Kassapa's light will guide us  
To reclaim our paradise

He walked a lonesome highway  
'Neath countless starry skies  
'Til he shone like the Lustrous Beam  
A beacon for our eyes

Through every age and time  
Inspiring us to seek the truth  
And make our spirits climb
