**Should You Use AI for Research with Ezra Klein**  
## 0:00  
i'm not completely against anything and  
## 0:03  
I have not and not for lack of trying  
## 0:06  
and I think not for lack of being  
## 0:08  
informed or interested in the issue  
## 0:10  
found a way that I consistently use AI  
## 0:13  
in my work i'll sometimes use it right  
## 0:15  
now as a replacement for Google searches  
## 0:16  
and and is valuable for that and deep  
## 0:19  
research has been good on some kinds of  
## 0:21  
preparatory work for me  
## 0:24  
it's just it's very hard to not be  
## 0:27  
outsourcing the part of the work I need  
## 0:29  
to do the most ai is better at the  
## 0:32  
things I need to do than the things I  
## 0:33  
don't need to do and so having AI  
## 0:39  
step in which I will sometimes do in a  
## 0:42  
crunch if I don't have time to like make  
## 0:44  
the spreadsheet myself and like gather  
## 0:46  
the data in the way I'd like to gather  
## 0:47  
it or but having AI summarize a book or  
## 0:50  
a paper for me is a disaster it has no  
## 0:53  
idea what I really wanted to know it  
## 0:54  
would not have made the connections I  
## 0:56  
would have made and so that is again to  
## 0:58  
to to my stance on this as somebody who  
## 1:01  
thinks it's the time I spent researching  
## 1:03  
that was the most important time having  
## 1:04  
AI do research for me is a bad idea but  
## 1:07  
you know if you had other people on the  
## 1:08  
show they'd give you something different  
## 1:09  
i think somebody like Tyler Cowen has  
## 1:11  
made AI much more fundamental to his  
## 1:13  
workflow um than I have but I'm  
## 1:17  
interested for the thing I will see that  
## 1:19  
other people would not have seen and I  
## 1:21  
think AI typically sees what everybody  
## 1:22  
else would see i guess what I'm trying  
## 1:24  
to figure out is like how much So on one  
## 1:26  
hand I hear what you're saying with that  
## 1:28  
is the most important part of my work  
## 1:29  
and I I agree i think that the years  
## 1:32  
have proven that out on the other hand I  
**Why Going Deep Matters More Than Going Fast**  
## 1:34  
wonder how much of it is like prompt  
## 1:36  
issue of can you prompt it in distinct  
## 1:39  
ways and and and all that i think of uh  
## 1:43  
AI almost like a looking at the world  
## 1:44  
through a kaleidoscope and I agree that  
## 1:47  
the default prompt gives you the way  
## 1:49  
that everybody else is looking but but  
## 1:51  
that's that's assuming that I know what  
## 1:54  
my prompt should be there's no prompt  
## 1:57  
that would have told me just go read  
## 2:00  
more books man you're not there you  
## 2:02  
haven't gone far enough  
## 2:04  
i'm not saying AI can't be useful not  
## 2:06  
saying it won't be useful but  
## 2:10  
I think I'm pretty against shortcuts  
## 2:14  
and obviously you have to limit the  
## 2:16  
amount of work you're doing you can't  
## 2:17  
read literally everything  
## 2:20  
but in some ways I think it's more  
## 2:22  
dangerous to think you've read something  
## 2:24  
that you haven't than to not read it at  
## 2:26  
all as somebody who knows the people at  
## 2:29  
these labs and has like talked to them  
## 2:31  
about how to use it and has access to  
## 2:33  
the good models it has not become an  
## 2:36  
honored partner in my creative workflow  
## 2:40  
right so then that seems like a pretty  
## 2:42  
important fault line of your writing and  
## 2:45  
you're like "Ah it's not that useful."  
## 2:46  
Then there is the I'm doing research i'm  
## 2:48  
trying to figure out what's going on  
## 2:50  
i'll use a super concrete example we're  
**What Humans See That AI Misses**  
## 2:52  
talking about homelessness is a housing  
## 2:53  
issue you know the kind of thing that  
## 2:57  
is really great for AI like I haven't  
## 2:59  
really thought about that i grew up in  
## 3:00  
San Francisco so it's like very near and  
## 3:01  
dear to my heart kind of watched the  
## 3:03  
city get destroyed by homelessness i  
## 3:05  
would use AI to basically say "Hey 03  
## 3:07  
can you give me a list of um how housing  
## 3:10  
has changed over the years list of  
## 3:12  
papers that have been written." But what  
## 3:14  
I'm hearing you say is "Yeah that's like  
## 3:15  
a better Google." That's not Then  
## 3:17  
there's something else of like I want  
## 3:19  
you to write this for me and that you  
## 3:20  
wouldn't use yeah also I wrote a piece  
## 3:23  
about this a couple years back um it was  
## 3:25  
called Against the Matrix Theory of the  
## 3:27  
Mind  
## 3:29  
and I think I used to conceptualize  
## 3:32  
knowledge the way you see it in the  
## 3:34  
movie The Matrix  
## 3:36  
where it's like I wanted the port in the  
## 3:40  
back of my mind that the little needle  
## 3:42  
would go into and then I had read John  
## 3:46  
RS's political liberalism right  
## 3:49  
i thought that what you were doing was  
## 3:52  
like downloading information into your  
## 3:54  
brain and now I think that what you're  
## 3:56  
doing is spending time grappling with  
## 3:59  
the text making connections it will only  
## 4:01  
happen through that process of grappling  
## 4:04  
and so the idea that you could speedrun  
## 4:06  
that the idea that it could just be  
## 4:08  
summarized for you  
## 4:11  
part of what is happening when you spend  
## 4:13  
seven hours reading a book is you spend  
## 4:14  
seven hours with your mind on this topic  
## 4:17  
the idea that 03 can summarize it for  
## 4:19  
you in addition to there's all this  
## 4:20  
stuff you just will not have read is  
## 4:22  
that you didn't have the engagement it  
## 4:24  
doesn't impress itself upon you it  
## 4:25  
doesn't change you what knowledge is  
## 4:28  
supposed to do is change you and it  
## 4:30  
changes you because you make connections  
## 4:31  
to it what you're saying is knowledge is  
## 4:34  
more embodied yes than just looking up  
## 4:37  
something on AI and then that because  
## 4:39  
knowledge is embodied it has a way of  
## 4:41  
becoming a part of you and flowing  
## 4:42  
through you into the writing yeah into  
## 4:45  
the writing into your thinking  
## 4:48  
you know not very much that  
## 4:51  
AI has given me has really it doesn't  
## 4:54  
change me very much i think that the  
## 4:56  
time you spend with things is pretty  
## 4:58  
important  
## 4:59  
and a reason you get changed over time I  
## 5:02  
mean I've been reading Matthew Glaciius  
## 5:03  
for how many years now right  
## 5:05  
since he was in college and I was in  
**Why Sticking With Topics Longer Pays Off**  
## 5:07  
college in some ways it is the length of  
## 5:10  
that relationship I've had with his work  
## 5:12  
that matters most any one piece is not  
## 5:15  
that important  
## 5:17  
and  
## 5:19  
you know when I sat down I read a RAND  
## 5:21  
report recently on housing construction  
## 5:23  
costs in different states in California  
## 5:24  
and Texas and in um Colorado  
## 5:28  
if I just had 03 spit that out it would  
## 5:30  
have been some useful factoids it  
## 5:32  
actually mattered that I spent more than  
## 5:34  
an hour on the report marking it up like  
## 5:36  
looking at the I just think there's  
## 5:39  
something about your process of  
## 5:42  
grappling with something that is what  
## 5:44  
makes it that integrates it into the way  
## 5:46  
your mind actually works i think  
## 5:49  
shortcuts often operate  
## 5:52  
off of a misguided  
## 5:55  
metaphor of how our minds work right  
## 5:57  
that again where we sort of have this  
## 5:59  
download model i'm downloading the  
## 6:01  
information and Sam Bankman Freed is one  
## 6:03  
of many tech people I've seen who would  
## 6:05  
be like what's the point of all these  
## 6:06  
books like shouldn't every book be a  
## 6:09  
magazine article and ideally shouldn't  
## 6:10  
every magazine article be a tweet and  
## 6:13  
the answer is no it shouldn't be in part  
## 6:16  
because that actually doesn't contain  
## 6:17  
the information I can say that for sure  
## 6:18  
having written books and then always  
## 6:21  
thinking about how much fidelity is lost  
## 6:23  
to them when I do the excerpts when I go  
## 6:25  
talk about them on podcasts but also  
## 6:27  
because it cannot change you a magazine  
## 6:31  
article will change you less than a book  
## 6:33  
will a tweet will change you less than a  
## 6:35  
magazine article will you may not  
## 6:37  
realize that at the time but  
## 6:41  
I think for most people most of the time  
## 6:42  
it's true it's a reason by the way  
## 6:44  
podcasting is powerful because when they  
## 6:46  
spend two hours with you over and over  
## 6:48  
and over again it's like what changes  
## 6:51  
you isn't the wave it's the erosion h  
## 6:55  
Yeah the the way this is also very vivid  
## 6:58  
in my life is travel where  
## 7:01  
if I go somewhere  
## 7:04  
somehow that place just becomes  
## 7:05  
completely alive to me in a in a way  
**What Travel Teaches You About Writing**  
## 7:08  
that it wasn't before if I just read  
## 7:09  
about it and what I'm really taking from  
## 7:11  
you here is actually what a book is  
## 7:14  
isn't just giving you a lot of  
## 7:15  
information it's giving you a container  
## 7:17  
to think about a narrowly defined scope  
## 7:20  
of ideas and that part of reading the  
## 7:23  
book is obviously downloading  
## 7:24  
downloading the information but the  
## 7:26  
other part is just the kind of  
## 7:28  
rumination that happens in your brain in  
## 7:30  
the process of consumption and and just  
## 7:34  
thinking about what it is that you're  
## 7:35  
reading and that's true for a lot of  
## 7:37  
things i mean travel is a good metaphor  
## 7:38  
here example I mean for me reporting  
## 7:40  
travel often works like this i had a  
## 7:42  
trip to Israel in the West Bank um a  
## 7:44  
year ago June  
## 7:46  
and I remember coming back and that trip  
## 7:49  
was really searing for me it was one of  
## 7:51  
the most emotionally intense reporting  
## 7:53  
trips I've ever done the most uh and I  
## 7:57  
come back to people saying "Well what  
## 7:58  
did I I would get the questions I was  
## 8:00  
like well what did you learn that you  
## 8:01  
didn't know going in?" And in a way the  
## 8:05  
answer was almost nothing  
## 8:07  
but now I understood it or at least  
## 8:10  
understood it in a different way than I  
## 8:11  
had before not in the way the people I  
## 8:12  
was talking to understood it you kind of  
## 8:14  
have epiphany through writing i mean I  
## 8:16  
know writers always love the Joan Ddian  
## 8:17  
quote i write to find out what I think  
## 8:19  
yeah yeah um but weirdly I think you  
## 8:22  
have to be careful with that because  
**How Writing Helps You Think Better**  
## 8:26  
sometimes writing is a process of  
## 8:28  
persuading you of what the piece needs  
## 8:31  
you to think and you got to be careful  
## 8:33  
not to become accidentally persuaded by  
## 8:37  
you know the formalism of whatever your  
## 8:38  
own assignment is  
## 8:40  
i notice that when I'm doing a podcast I  
## 8:43  
don't feel a need to come to one best  
## 8:45  
answer on something and so I can hold a  
## 8:48  
lot of different ideas in tension and  
## 8:50  
end with them unresolved and I often  
## 8:52  
think that's a good intellectual place  
## 8:53  
to be when I'm writing there's more of a  
## 8:56  
need to chisel down to my one best  
## 8:58  
argument and in doing that the person I  
## 9:00  
always persuade the most is myself  
## 9:02  
because I'm going through this whole  
## 9:03  
background process of weighing things  
## 9:05  
discarding them and I'm not saying  
## 9:06  
that's not valuable but sometimes I  
## 9:09  
think afterwards I over persuaded myself  
## 9:13  
i talked myself more into something than  
## 9:15  
I should have i didn't leave enough  
## 9:16  
doubt i didn't you know leave  
## 9:18  
uncertainty  
## 9:20  
instead of believing three or four  
## 9:22  
things might be true or all were making  
## 9:23  
a reasonable point I talked myself into  
## 9:25  
the idea that one thing was true it's  
## 9:27  
not that I think I was wrong it's just I  
## 9:30  
didn't leave room for the opposite and  
## 9:32  
sometimes you need to at least like be  
## 9:34  
holding things in tension to understand  
## 9:37  
you know very complicated currents in  
## 9:39  
life so yeah you've always got to be I  
## 9:41  
think a little careful with the way that  
## 9:45  
writing particularly if you haven't done  
## 9:46  
enough and complex enough work behind it  
## 9:49  
will persuade you of a simpler reality  
## 9:51  
than you should really believe well if  
## 9:52  
you like that clip I think you're going  
## 9:54  
to like the full episode and I've linked  
## 9:56
