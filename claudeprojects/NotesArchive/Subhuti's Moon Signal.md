Lyrics:  
**Verse 1:**   
Subhuti, the wise, the senior of the fold,   
Walked a path of light, a story untold.   
Saw Buddhas by the trillions, in their celestial array,   
Respect, honor, devotion, every step of the way.  
  
**Chorus:**   
Moon Signal, shining bright, a guiding star,   
Radiant Wisdom, his realm, near and far.   
Jewel trees and flowers, a land so pure,   
Countless disciples, his teachings endure.  
  
**Verse 2:**   
Twelve epochs he reigned, a celestial king,   
Twenty epochs his teachings, the Dharma did sing.   
A facsimile, an echo, his wisdom's relay,   
Gods and men, like Ganges' sand, in his radiant sway.  
  
**Chorus:**   
Moon Signal, shining bright, a guiding star,   
Radiant Wisdom, his realm, near and far.   
Jewel trees and flowers, a land so pure,   
Countless disciples, his teachings endure.  
  
**Bridge:**   
Subhuti, the seeker, the Buddha-to-be,   
Thirty-two signs of a Seer, for all to see.   
Beneficial, bountiful, leading the way,   
Saving countless beings, night and day.  
  
**Chorus:**   
Moon Signal, shining bright, a guiding star,   
Radiant Wisdom, his realm, near and far.   
Jewel trees and flowers, a land so pure,   
Countless disciples, his teachings endure.  
  
**Outro:**   
So listen close, and lend an ear,   
Subhuti's journey, let it ring clear.   
A tale of enlightenment, a cosmic display,   
Moon Signal's wisdom, forever will stay.
