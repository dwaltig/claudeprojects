Lyrics:  
[Verse]  
In shadows of illusion I dwell tonight  
In whispers of the wind I see the light  
Expedient truths I share to end the fight  
A gleam of peace to ease the endless plight  
  
[Verse 2]  
In realms unseen I trace the path so clear  
A silent vow to heal what all must fear  
Though fate might seem to pull me far from here  
In each heartbeat my presence reappears  
  
[Chorus]  
I show Nirvāṇa but I'm always near  
A constant flame to wipe away the tear  
Beyond the veil my voice you often hear  
In every soul my words will reappear  
  
[Verse]  
A timeless tale within the flow of time  
A sacred vow enshrined in every rhyme  
The suffering shall find a life sublime  
In endless cycles endless is my climb  
  
[Bridge]  
In echoes of the Dharma I confide  
Eternal truths that rhythms can't divide  
With every breath I am forever tied  
To those who seek the light I shall provide  
  
[Chorus]  
I show Nirvāṇa but I'm always near  
A constant flame to wipe away the tear  
Beyond the veil my voice you often hear  
In every soul my words will reappear  
  
[Chorus]  
I show Nirvāṇa but I'm always near  
A constant flame to wipe away the tear  
Beyond the veil my voice you often hear  
In every soul my words will reappear  
  
In every soul my words will reappear
