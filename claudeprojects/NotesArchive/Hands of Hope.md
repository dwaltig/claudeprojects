In a village by the hills, lived a farmer named Elias,  
Worked his fields at dawn, ’neath the open skies.  
Planted seeds with hope, whispered prayers of gold,  
Dreamed of a harvest, with a heart so bold.

Through the storms and through the rain,  
We’ll rise above the fear and pain,  
Hope will shine through every tear,  
For the harvest, we’ll persevere.

When the skies turned dark, and the winds did wail,  
Villagers gathered ’round, with their fearful tales.  
Droughts and floods they spoke, hearts filled with dread,  
Elias stood firm, and this is what he said:

Hope will shine through every tear,

Worked through scorching heat, and the bitter cold,  
Hands calloused and strong, stories untold.  
Looked to the horizon, with unwavering care,  
Knew each drop of sweat was a hopeful prayer.

In the soil, our dreams are laid,  
With every step, a future made,  
Trust in hands, and hearts so true,  
In the work that we all do.

One evening ‘neath the sunset’s glow,  
Fields turned lush where seeds did sow.  
Rains had come, gentle and kind,  
Washed away the fears, and peace we’d find.

We’ll rise above the fear and pain,  
Hope will shine through every tear,  
For the harvest, we’ll persevere.

Villagers gathered, in grateful delight,  
Asked how he kept hope, through the darkest night.  
Elias smiled, with wisdom in his tone,  
“In the seeds we plant, our hopes have grown.”
