(Verse 1 - Slow, soulful intro with a hint of yearning)  
  
(Piano intro, a simple, repeating chord progression)  
  
A shroud of gray, a hollow void within.  
Searching for a truth to make me whole.  
Confused and lost, I couldn't see the way,  
Longing for a light to guide my day.  
  
(Verse 2 - Slightly more upbeat, building in intensity)  
  
[A slight instrumental break or a single line sung a capella could emphasize the moment of]  
“awakening.”  
  
But then a whisper, a gentle call,  
"Look within," it echoed, "give your all."  
In this present moment, I started to see,  
A wisdom shining, setting my spirit free.  
  
(Chorus - Full voice, powerful and uplifting)  
  
Oh, in this now, in this very now, I see!  
The veil is lifted, I’m finally free!  
Love shows me the why, the reasons so clear,  
Love fills me with grace, Love banishes fear.  
Love is everywhere, love surrounds, love saves,  
My heart rejoices, in these grace-filled waves!  
  
(Verse 3 - Moderate tempo, reflective but joyful)  
  
The questions answered, the mysteries unfold,  
A tapestry of life, a story to be told.  
The connections deepen, my heart opens wide,  
In this understanding, I peacefully abide.  
  
(Chorus - Full voice, even more powerful than before)  
  
Oh, in this now, in this very now, I see!  
The veil is lifted, I’m finally free!  
Love shows me the why, the reasons so clear,  
Love fills me with grace, Love banishes fear.  
Love is everywhere, love surrounds, love saves,  
My heart rejoices, in these grace-filled waves!  
  
(Bridge - Slower, more intimate, with a build in emotion)  
  
No longer lost, no longer in the night,  
Bathed in this love, filled with pure delight.  
I understand now, with a deeper sight,  
That love is the power, the truth, the light!  
  
The chains are broken, I rise above,  
A song of freedom, a hymn of love.  
  
(Chorus - Full voice, powerful and triumphant)  
  
Oh, in this now, in this very now, I see!  
The veil is lifted, I’m finally free!  
Love shows me the why, the reasons so clear,  
Love fills me with grace, Love banishes fear.  
Love is everywhere, love surrounds, love saves,  
My heart rejoices, in these grace-filled waves!  
  
(Outro - Slows down, becomes more reflective, fades out with an Amen)  
  
(Piano fades with a sustained chord)  
In the now, Love’s seen; why made clear.  
Love is everywhere… Amen..
