# A Dust Particle's Journey  
  
To grasp time's vast and endless span,   
The Buddha offers this grand plan:   
Imagine Earth to dust you grind,   
Each tiny speck, a world you'll find.  
  
One particle, a journey starts,   
Across a thousand worlds, it darts,   
To eastern realms, a speck so small,   
A cosmic dance, beyond recall.  
  
Repeat this trek, with every grain,   
Through realms unseen, a vast domain.   
Can mind conceive, this boundless sight?   
A thousand worlds, in endless flight.  
  
The Buddha asks, with wisdom deep,   
"Can you this number fathom, keep?"   
No mortal mind, nor counting's art,   
Can grasp this truth, with beating heart.  
  
For even greater, time has flown,   
Since ancient Buddha, light has shown. Mahâbhigñâgñânâbhibhû, his name,   
A beacon bright, in life's grand game.  
  
This tale reminds, of cycles old,   
Buddhas arise, as times unfold.  
Buddhas arise, as times unfold.  
Siddhartha, one, in this great dance,   
Of wisdom's light, a guiding glance.
