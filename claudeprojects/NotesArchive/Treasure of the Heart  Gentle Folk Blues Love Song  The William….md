Lyrics:   
[Verse 1]  
You came along just when I was ready  
I wasn't searchin' for you but I could have been  
We fell together  
Life got better  
I wasn't lonely but it all just fell in  
  
[Verse 2]  
Then in a moment  
I had to leave you  
I wasn't ready to go but I had to be strong  
Life gave us a story  
Full of glory  
I wasn't ready but the story goes on  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause you are the treasure of my heart  
You are the treasure of my heart  
You are the treasure of my heart  
You are the treasure of my heart  
  
[Verse 3]  
You are the lover of my soul  
The way you loved me was like a song  
I can hear you singin' so I keep on goin'  
I wasn't ready but I keep movin' on  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause you are the treasure of my heart  
You are the treasure of my heart  
You are the treasure of my heart  
You are the treasure of my heart

*A tender and poetic scene. An acoustic guitar resting gently against a tree at sunset. Soft golden light filters through the trees. In the background, faint silhouettes of two people walking away hand in hand, becoming distant and translucent, symbolizing memory and love transcending time. A few gentle heart-shaped leaves float down. Warm, soulful color palette: soft golds, warm browns, and light blues. Folk blues album cover, emotional and peaceful.*
