[Verse 1]  
In ancient pages, wisdom gleams,  
A truth both old and ever-new.  
The Lotus Sutra, king of kings,  
Enlightens me, enlightens you.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, the Lotus Sutra's light,  
Turns our darkness into sight.  
Through the day, throughout the night,  
Its teachings make our burdens light.  
Faith empowers, wisdom guides,  
In this truth, our joy resides.  
  
[Verse 2]  
A thousand Buddhas guard our path,  
As chants rise up with fervent might.  
From suffering to serenity,  
We journey towards the purest light.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, the Lotus Sutra's light,  
Turns our darkness into sight.  
Through the day, throughout the night,  
Its teachings make our burdens light.  
Faith empowers, wisdom guides,  
In this truth, our joy resides.  
  
[Bridge]  
Hard to grasp, yet simple too,  
This paradox of higher truth.  
With open hearts, we'll come to know,  
The end of pain, eternal youth.  
  
[Verse 3]  
Each day we study, each day we grow,  
In verses deep, our spirits soar.  
The more we learn, the more we see,  
The less we cling, the more we're free.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, the Lotus Sutra's light,  
Turns our darkness into sight.  
Through the day, throughout the night,  
Its teachings make our burdens light.  
Faith empowers, wisdom guides,  
In this truth, our joy resides.  
  
[Outro]  
From ignorance to wisdom's peak,  
The Lotus Sutra shows the way.  
In understanding, we find peace,  
In peace, true understanding stays.
