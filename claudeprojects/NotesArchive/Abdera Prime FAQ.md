They are a homosexual society that values physical perfection, particularly muscle mass, symmetry, and aesthetic physique. Abderans have a lifespan of 110-130 years, aging slower than Earthlings. They live in a prosperous, technologically advanced society where they are supported by a smaller race called Whiskerfolk.  
## Why was Greg brought to Abdera?  
Greg was specifically chosen for his genetic material and attractiveness to Abderans. As a healthy, athletic man from Earth, Greg offers genetic diversity to the Abderan gene pool, which has been heavily modified over millennia. His attraction to large, muscular men also makes him an ideal candidate for integration into their society.

## What are the Whiskerfolk?  
Whiskerfolk are a smaller, furry species that co-exist with the Abderans in a mutually beneficial relationship. They provide domestic support, food production, and industrial labor, while the Abderans offer protection and resources in return. The Whiskerfolk have their own culture and settlements but are numerically fewer than the Abderans.
