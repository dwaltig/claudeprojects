# The Buddha’s Eyes Blues  
  
*Buddha’s Eyes Blues* is a slow-rolling, rootsy folk-blues meditation on the heart of Chapter Ten of the *Lotus Sūtra*.  
  
With warm finger-picked guitar, mournful slide, and harmonica sighs, it honors the sutra’s call to **make offerings of devotion and daily action**.  
  
Each verse carries the listener down a dusty road of incense smoke and open palms, where giving is not about barter but about **opening the Buddha’s eyes within**—seeing the oneness of all life and the beautiful differences that make every being unique.  
  
This song is both an homage and an invitation: to treat every kitchen and street corner as a sacred hall, to offer kindness as the highest gift, and to walk the wide world with awakened eyes.

**Verse 1 – The Offering Road**  
G  
I laid my flowers down, incense smoke in the rain,  
C  
Every coin of my heart, every ounce of my pain.  
G  
Not to buy a heaven, not to pay some dues,  
D7  
But to open these eyes that the Buddha can use.  
  
**Chorus – Seeing True**  
G  
Oh the world’s all equal, and every face unique,  
C  
Joy and sorrow mingle, every soul has speech.  
G  
The same wide sky, a million different hues—  
D7                       G  
That’s the view when you walk in the Buddha’s shoes.  
  
**Verse 2 – Keeper of the Word**  
G  
I met a dusty pilgrim with a sutra in his hands,  
C  
Said “I’m just a singer in these broken lands.  
G  
But the words I carry are the living flame,  
D7  
Hold one line with love, and you’ll never be the same.”  
  
**(Chorus)**  
  
**Bridge – Equality & Difference**  
C  
The mountain and the river, the beggar and the king,  
G  
All rise and fall inside the self-same ring.  
C  
Yet each breath is a fingerprint, each cry its own tune—  
D7  
One Dharma rain, but a thousand blooms.  
  
**Verse 3 – Everyday Temple**  
G  
So I make my offering in the work I do,  
C  
In the kindness I plant, in the songs I sing for you.  
G  
Every street and kitchen is a sacred hall,  
D7  
Where the Buddha’s eyes are seeing it all.  
  
**Outro / Tag**  
G  
I laid my flowers down, incense smoke in the rain,  
C  
Opened these eyes and I’ll never be the same.  
G  
Buddha’s eyes blues, running through my veins,  
D7                   G  
One world, many colors, one endless flame.

**Performance Notes**  
	•	**Feel**: Slow-rolling 12-bar groove, think Mississippi John Hurt meets modern folk.  
	•	**Guitar**: Finger-picked bass-line alternating with treble fills; add a resonant slide on the bridge to suggest the “Buddha eye” shimmer.  
	•	**Vocals**: Warm and unhurried, with a slight gravel to carry the “offering road” weight.  
	•	**Harmonica**: A wailing response between lines of the chorus, like a wind through temple bells.
