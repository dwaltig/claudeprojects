Thank you for pointing out I’m also learning how to walk this path. I'm very fortunate to encounter your community. YOU'RE an answer to prayer and meeting great bodhisattvas such as you assure me I’m on the right path. Thank You for reminding me of the diversity between the lens of privilege and the lens of oppression. May we soon learn how to transform our negative experiences into the fuel that empowers our lives, and May our peaceful dialog find a middle path, if not liberation.
