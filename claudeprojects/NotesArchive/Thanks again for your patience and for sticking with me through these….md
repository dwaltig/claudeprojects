**Thanks again for your patience and for sticking with me through these adjustments.**  
  
I wanted to touch base about payment. You received **$240 on April 15**, which originally covered the full scope of work for **April**, including **YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Spotify, and SoundCloud**.

Now that we’ve decided to pause efforts on **Spotify and SoundCloud**, the scope of work has shifted. Here’s what I’d like to propose moving forward:  
Now that we’ve decided to pause efforts on **Spotify and SoundCloud**, the scope of work has shifted. Here’s what I’d like to propose moving forward:  
	•	You’ll continue to work through **May** on **YouTube, Facebook, and Instagram**, as outlined in the goals document.  
	•	The **remaining value from the April payment ($120)** will be applied to cover **May**, reflecting the reduced scope.  
	•	Then starting in **June**, we’ll move to a **$120/month rate**, unless we bring back Spotify or SoundCloud promotions.  
  
This keeps things fair and transparent on both sides. Let me know if you have any questions or thoughts.  
  
Thanks again,  
**William**
