# Jewel of the Dharma  
  
**The Ocean's Depth**  
From the **vast ocean** of wisdom profound, Rises a teaching beyond all compare, Where seekers of truth have forever found The deepest of mysteries lying bare.  
  
**The Mountain's Majesty**  
Like **Mount Sumeru** towering high, The Lotus stands central in cosmic space, Its summit reaching the boundless sky, Unmoved by storms, in eternal grace.  
  
**Celestial Light**  
The **radiant moon** on darkest night, Illuminates paths where shadows roam, With silver beams of perfect light, Guiding lost wanderers safely home.  
  
**Sovereign Truth**  
As a **crowned king** upon the throne, This sutra reigns with gentle might,Its golden words like precious stone, Reflecting dharma's purest light.  
  
**Ancestral Wisdom**  
An **elder's** counsel, timeless, wise, Speaks through the ages, clear and true, Revealing where enlightenment lies, In simplest acts we daily do.  
  
**Supreme Authority**  
Like a **national ruler** just and fair, The Lotus governs all doctrine's realm, With compassion beyond compare, And wisdom steady at the helm.  
  
**Twin Celestial Bodies**  
**Sun and moon** in perfect unity, Dispelling darkness, bringing dawn, The Lotus shines eternally, Until all suffering is gone.  
  
In one flower's opening, All worlds awaken.
