To reach enlightenment is the aim,  
Overcoming the cycle of birth and pain.  
Mystic Truth in all living things does exist,  
Myoho-renge-kyo, the key to unclench the fist.  
   
Perceiving this truth is of the essence,  
To reach enlightenment, the ultimate presence.  
The Lotus Sutra, the wisdom of all Buddhas,  
Reveals the true nature of life, as we suffer.  
   
Life at each moment, the principle of inclusiveness,  
Every living being, one in the same likeness.  
Perceiving the nature of one's life is the key,  
Erasing grave offenses, so we can break free.  
   
Chanting Myoho-renge-kyo, planting roots of goodness,  
Polishing the mirror of the mind, a way to reduce distress.  
The Mystic Law is the ultimate reality,  
Transcending existence, non-existence, and mortality.  
   
No teachings outside of oneself can lead,  
Only by perceiving the true nature of life, one can succeed.  
Buddhism, a path towards inner peace and liberation,  
A way to reach enlightenment, for every generation.
