*(Verse 1)*  
I stood on the edge, where the shadows fade,  
A light broke through, but I was so afraid.  
It shone so bright, like the morning sun,  
But I couldn’t see, I was on the run.  
  
*(Chorus)*  
Oh, clear light, I’m callin’ your name,  
But the fear inside, it’s a burnin’ flame.  
Let me see you, for what you are,  
Not a distant dream, but my shining star.  
  
*(Verse 2)*  
My mind’s a river, flowing fast and wild,  
But in that light, I’m just a child.  
Holdin’ on tight to what I used to be,  
But the truth is clear, it’s all just me.  
  
*(Chorus)*  
Oh, clear light, I’m callin’ your name,  
But the fear inside, it’s a burnin’ flame.  
Let me see you, for what you are,  
Not a distant dream, but my shining star.  
  
*(Bridge)*  
The ego’s a cage, keeps me bound and tied,  
But in your glow, there’s nowhere to hide.  
If I could just let go, fall into your grace,  
I’d find my home, in that sacred space.  
  
*(Verse 3)*  
The struggle’s long, the night’s so deep,  
But in that light, there’s no need to weep.  
It’s the end of the road, the start of the climb,  
Where the clear light shines, beyond space and time.  
  
*(Chorus)*  
Oh, clear light, I’m callin’ your name,  
But the fear inside, it’s a burnin’ flame.  
Let me see you, for what you are,  
Not a distant dream, but my shining star.  
  
*(Chorus)*  
Oh, clear light, I’m callin’ your name,  
But the fear inside, it’s a burnin’ flame.  
Let me see you, for what you are,  
Not a distant dream, but my shining star.  
  
*(Reprise Bridge)*  
The ego’s a cage, keeps me bound and tied,  
But in your glow, there’s nowhere to hide.  
If I could just let go, fall into your grace,  
I’d find my home, in that sacred space.  
  
*(Reprise Verse 3)*  
The struggle’s long, the night’s so deep,  
But in that light, there’s no need to weep.  
It’s the end of the road, the start of the climb,  
Where the clear light shines, beyond space and time.  
  
*(Chorus)*  
Oh, clear light, I’m callin’ your name,  
But the fear inside, it’s a burnin’ flame.  
Let me see you, for what you are,  
Not a distant dream, but my shining star.  
  
*(Outro)*  
In the clear light’s glow, I found my way,  
No more shadows, no more sway.  
The truth is here, as bright as day,  
In the clear light’s arms, I’m here to stay.
