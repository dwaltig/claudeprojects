**The Feeling of Dharma**  
I asked him softly,  
“If I walk the Eightfold Path—not study it, not recite it, but walk it—what feeling will arise in me?”  
He paused.  
And in that pause, I felt a silence not of stillness,  
but of distance.  
The kind of silence that speaks of knowing the words  
but not the song.  
I remembered reading of release—  
not as a doctrine, but as a breath unbound,  
a weight set down without ceremony,  
a joy that comes not from gaining,  
but from no longer needing.  
And in that moment,  
I saw a quiet truth:  
One may teach the Dharma  
without having tasted its sweetness.  
No judgment, only sorrow.  
For what is more precious than the felt knowing  
that truth is not a concept,  
but a presence?  
When I walk rightly,  
not for virtue’s sake,  
but because my feet know the rhythm of peace,  
I do not need confirmation.  
Right view is the moment I stop trying to fix the world  
and begin to meet it.  
Right speech is the word I do not say,  
because silence holds more love.  
The Dharma is not taught—it is touched.  
It is the joy not of the senses,  
but of the soul remembering its own light.  
Nichiren said,  
“Winter always turns to spring.”  
Yes.  
I have heard the frost crack  
and the thaw begin  
in my own chest.  
I asked what the Eightfold Path feels like.  
And in the stillness after the question,  
I discovered:  
I already knew.
