Theft and vandalism is on the raise in our neighborhood. Yesterday late afternoon/early evening, Connie P. found the Handicap parking signpost (usually up on west side near emergency gate) was uprooted and tossed into bushes in front of unit 3 halfway down the parking lot. She put the post back into its proper spot pretty firmly—please keep an eye out in general in case it is removed by somebody who thinks messing with things like that is “fun” and wants to vandalizes more.
