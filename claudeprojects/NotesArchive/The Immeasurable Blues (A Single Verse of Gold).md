# The Immeasurable Blues (A Single Verse of Gold)  
(Slow, rhythmic guitar riff, featuring a wandering, reflective tone)  
##   
## Verse 1 (The Toil of the Lesser Path)  
A weary traveler, Lord, for ages I had strayed,  
Built grand and pious stūpas, a thousand years I prayed.  
I gave my grain and gilded coins, kept every ritual true,  
Forgetting the infinite path, and the greater work to do.  
I was sweeping up the shadows in the smoky, burning room,  
Content with smaller labors, lost in self-made gloom.  
But the Master saw my spirit, though my skin was turning gray,  
"My child," he said, "you stopped too soon, you have more work today."  
##   
## Chorus  
Oh, the Dharma's a river that frees you from the pain,  
One single word of joyful faith, an endless, cleansing rain.  
All the merit piled up high, like fragile, mountain ice,  
Doesn't weigh a dust-speck's measure against pure paradise.  
##   
## Verse 2 (The Hidden Gem)  
Lord, I traveled on for so long, and wandered in the strife,  
I forgot the priceless jewel, the true source of my life.  
My Teacher saw me begging bread, lost and with a hollow dread,  
The priceless gem still sewn within the lining of my coat.  
He knew my fear was too profound to hear the truth out loud,  
So he gave me smaller gifts just to draw me from the crowd.  
Said, "Take this for the journey now, but don't just walk the floor,  
There is a greater wisdom waiting, and so much more in store."  
##   
## Chorus  
Oh, the Dharma's a river that frees you from the pain,  
One single word of joyful faith, an endless, cleansing rain.  
All the merit piled up high, like fragile, mountain ice,  
Doesn't weigh a dust-speck's measure against pure paradise.  
##   
## Bridge (The Sweet Voice)  
It hit me in a moment, a flash of sacred sound,  
The gentle, tender whisper on this hallowed, holy ground.  
A knowledge not for lesser aims, not for a smaller prize,  
Just the final truth reflected in my Master's eyes.  
My aching body softened, my old face started to gleam,  
For I stepped into the current of the everlasting stream.  
##   
## Outro  
So give up your small ambition, friend, let deep wisdom shine,  
That final, perfect knowledge that is already yours and mine.  
Oh, the immeasurable freedom, the merit, yours to own,  
In the joyful, endless Dharma that our Master has shown.  
(Fade out on sustained guitar chord and quiet rhythmic drum beat)
