#  One True Path  
  
Verse 1:  
The Sun and moon, shine on everyone  
The Sun and moon, shine on everyone  
The Sun and moon, shine on everyone  
The Thus Come One, His wisdom has begun  
From high to low, fragrant to foul  
His words, they reach every living soul  
  
Chorus:  
One source, one sacred word  
Three paths, but have you heard?  
It's all the same, don't you see?  
In Buddha's light, we're all free  
  
Verse 2:  
Five states of being, we're all bound  
But Buddha's way, it's all around  
Like a potter with his clay  
Shaping souls in every way  
  
Chorus:  
One source, one sacred word  
Three paths, but have you heard?  
It's all the same, don't you see?  
In Buddha's light, we're all free  
In Buddha's light, we're all free  
  
Bridge:  
Disciples, Buddhas, Bodhisattvas too  
One great sea of wisdom, tried and true  
No second, no third, just one vehicle  
Buddha's teachings, they're all-embraceable  
  
Verse 3:  
Sugar, ghee, and curd in different pots  
But it's all clay, believe it or not  
So find your path, seek your truth  
In wisdom's all-embracing youth  
  
Chorus:  
One source, one sacred word  
Three paths, but have you heard?  
It's all the same, don't you see?  
In Buddha's light, we're all free  
In Buddha's light, we're all free  
  
Outro:  
One source, one sacred word  
In Buddha's light, have you heard?  
We're all free, don't you see?  
In Buddha's light, you and me
