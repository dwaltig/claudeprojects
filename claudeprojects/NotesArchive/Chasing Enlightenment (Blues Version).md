# Chasing Enlightenment (Blues Version)  
  
  
  
  
[**Verse 1**] Walkin' down these wild streets of time Dreams of wisdom echo, like a distant chime Buddha’s light so far, up in the sky Feels like I’ll reach it, just gotta try  
  
[**Chorus**] Enlightenment’s high, but I can see Every step I take brings me closer to free The road is rough, full of twists and bends But every stumble’s where the soul mends  
  
[**Verse 2**] Sittin’ alone beneath that ancient tree The wisdom echoes deep inside of me A quiet hum, like wind through the leaves Untanglin' the knots, bringin' sweet relief  
  
[**Chorus**] Enlightenment’s high, but I can see Every step I take brings me closer to free The road is rough, full of twists and bends But every stumble’s where the soul mends  
  
[**Bridge**] Through cold dark nights, and burnin’ days Lost in the maze, searchin’ my own ways Each wrong turn’s a lesson in disguise Keep chasin' the sun, till the mornin' rise  
  
[**Verse 3**] Eyes shut, still searchin' within Through clouds of doubt, where hope begins Though the path twists, it's worth the while In every tear hides the Buddha’s smile
