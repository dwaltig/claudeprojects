**From my study of the of the Gosho, I learned: **  
  
1. **The Lotus Sutra is the ultimate Law of life and death.**It surpasses all differences and teaches that all people can attain Buddhahood.  
  
2. **The Lotus Sutra contains the heritage of Shakyamuni Buddha, passed down through Bodhisattva Superior Practices.** By studying the sutra, students tap into this lineage and inherit the ultimate Law of life and death.  
  
3. **Chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo with deep faith, as taught in the Lotus Sutra, leads to a profound understanding of life and death.** This understanding allows individuals to see earthly desires as enlightenment and the suffering of birth and death as nirvana.  
  
4. **The Lotus Sutra teaches that those who have faith in it and chant Nam-myoho-renge-kyo will be protected by a thousand Buddhas.** This protection ensures they will be free from fear and avoid negative paths. Conversely, those who disbelieve the sutra will face negative consequences.  
  
5. **Faith in the Lotus Sutra connects practitioners in a strong spiritual bond.**This unity enables the widespread propagation of the Lotus Sutra's teachings and creates a shared heritage.  
  
Nichiren stresses that embracing the Lotus Sutra alone is insufficient without the heritage of faith. Studying the Lotus Sutra helps cultivate this faith, allowing individuals to inherit the ultimate Law of life and death and manifest it in their lives.
