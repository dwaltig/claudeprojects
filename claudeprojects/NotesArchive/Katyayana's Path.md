Lyrics:  
(Verse 1)   
Katyayana, the disciple bold,   
A future bright, the story told.   
Eighty billion Buddhas, he'll revere,   
Stupas tall, their memory held dear.  
  
(Chorus)   
Gold and silver, lapis so blue,   
Flowers and incense, offerings true.   
Katyayana's journey, long and wide,   
To Buddhahood's light, he'll surely ride.  
  
(Verse 2)   
Two hundred billion more, he'll pay his respects,   
In his final life, his path elects.   
Gold Shine, the Buddha he'll become,   
A realm of peace, where all are welcome.  
  
(Chorus)   
Gold and silver, lapis so blue,   
Flowers and incense, offerings true.   
Katyayana's journey, long and wide,   
To Buddhahood's light, he'll surely ride.  
  
(Bridge)   
Twelve epochs long, his teachings will last,   
A legacy of wisdom, unsurpassed.   
Disciples and Bodhisattvas, a joyful throng,   
In his pure realm, they'll all belong.  
  
(Chorus)   
Gold and silver, lapis so blue,   
Flowers and incense, offerings true.   
Katyayana's journey, long and wide,   
To Buddhahood's light, he'll surely ride.  
  
(Outro)   
Oh, Katyayana, your path we see,   
A beacon of hope, for you and me.   
May we all strive, with hearts sincere,   
To reach that light, and banish fear.
