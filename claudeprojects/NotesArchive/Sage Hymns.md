I'm so excited to share my new playlist, "Sage Hymns," with you. These songs are my musical interpretations of the Psalms, each one exploring the timeless themes of faith, hope, and the deep spiritual connection that resonates throughout these ancient texts.  
The music is a blend of soulful blues, folk melodies, and a touch of something truly unique. It's an invitation to journey into the depths of your own heart and connect with the spirit of these powerful words.  
Take a listen on SoundCloud and let me know what you think! I'd love to hear your thoughts on the songs and how the Psalms have inspired them.
