[Verse 1]    
I’m a traveler, been walkin’ so long,    
Carryin’ dust, singin’ time’s old song.    
Every step, I take that grain,    
A thousand worlds, through joy and pain.  
  
[Chorus]    
Oh, I’ve been movin’, through the skies so wide,    
Countin’ dust, watchin’ time collide.    
Ain’t no end, to the roads I roam,    
But every mile brings me closer home.  
  
[Verse 2]    
The first world bloomed, with colors so bright,    
But I left my dust and slipped into the night.    
Met a man, cloaked in starry light,    
Said, “You carry time, not just the dust you fight.”  
  
[Chorus]    
Oh, I’ve been movin’, through the skies so wide,    
Countin’ dust, watchin’ time collide.    
Ain’t no end, to the roads I roam,    
But every mile brings me closer home.  
  
[Verse 3]    
Saw the world fall, to silence and stone,    
Mountains crumbled, and I walked alone.    
An old voice called, from deep in the earth,    
Said, “That dust you carry holds the weight of birth.”  
  
[Chorus]    
Oh, I’ve been movin’, through the skies so wide,    
Countin’ dust, watchin’ time collide.    
Ain’t no end, to the roads I roam,    
But every mile brings me closer home.  
  
[Bridge]    
Through cycles of life, and ages gone by,    
The dust in my hand, it taught me why.    
The roads may be long, but every grain,    
Holds the key to breakin’ life’s old chain.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[Verse 4]    
Met a Buddha at the edge of the sky,    
He smiled and said, “Ain’t no need to cry.”    
“You’ve carried the dust, you’ve seen the truth,    
Time don’t own you, now here’s the proof.”  
  
[Chorus]    
Oh, I’ve been movin’, through the skies so wide,    
Countin’ dust, watchin’ time collide.    
Ain’t no end, to the roads I roam,    
But every mile brings me closer home.  
  
[Outro]    
Now I’m one with the dust, one with the breeze,    
Travelin’ on, with an easy peace.    
Ain’t no end to the journey I choose,    
But I found my way through the traveler’s blues.  
  
[End]
