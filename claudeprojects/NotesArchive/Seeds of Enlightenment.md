Lyrics:  
*(Verse 1)*  
*(Verse 1)*  
In wisdom’s garden, vast and deep,  
Where the wise ones go, their secrets keep,  
A lotus blooms, oh, petals bright,  
Its teachings shine through the darkest night.  
  
*(Chorus)*  
*(Chorus)*  
Oh, let it grow, let it show,  
That seed of wisdom deep below,  
In every heart, let it start,  
Till it blooms, yeah, till it blooms.  
  
*(Verse 2)*  
*(Verse 2)*  
To those who listen, hearts aglow,  
The sutra’s wisdom starts to flow,  
A seed of hope in troubled lands,  
Promisin’ peace from life’s demands.  
  
*(Chorus)*  
*(Chorus)*  
Oh, let it grow, let it show,  
That seed of wisdom deep below,  
In every heart, let it start,  
Till it blooms, yeah, till it blooms.  
  
*(Bridge)*  
*(Bridge)*  
Even the doubters, those who stray,  
Carry a spark that won’t fade away,  
Through life to life, in endless streams,  
Till wisdom blooms in all their dreams.  
  
*(Verse 3)*  
*(Verse 3)*  
In every soul, a wisdom sleeps,  
A truth that time and silence keeps,  
Waitin’ for that sacred hour,  
To unfold its mighty power.  
  
*(Chorus)*  
*(Chorus)*  
Oh, let it grow, let it show,  
That seed of wisdom deep below,  
In every heart, let it start,  
Till it blooms, yeah, till it blooms.  
  
*(Verse 4)*  
*(Verse 4)*  
The sutra whispers loud and clear,  
“All souls are wise, both far and near,”  
No one lost, no one apart,  
All bound for wisdom’s restart.  
  
*(Chorus)*  
*(Chorus)*  
Oh, let it grow, let it show,  
That seed of wisdom deep below,  
In every heart, let it start,  
Till it blooms, yeah, till it blooms.  
  
*(Outro)*  
*(Outro)*  
So cradle this truth in your chest,  
Let its rhythm give you rest,  
For in its arms, all paths align,  
And every soul will find its time.  
  
*(Repeat Chorus)*  
*(Repeat Chorus)*  
Oh, let it grow, let it show,  
That seed of wisdom deep below,  
In every heart, let it start,  
Till it blooms, yeah, till it blooms.
