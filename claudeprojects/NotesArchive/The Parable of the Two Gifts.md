**[Verse 1]**   
Yo, once upon a time from the heavens above, Came two mighty gifts, one was knowledge, one was love, The first was from the wise, enlightened, so pure, Showin' us the way to live, the path to endure, Taught us how to rise, how to see beyond the skies, Find the truth within, where compassion never dies, They gave us inner peace, they gave us harmony, Said the world ain't divided, nah, it's one family.  
  
**[Chorus]** Two gifts from the skies, you know we gotta choose, One leads to power, but the other? Never lose, Knowledge is a weapon, but wisdom’s the key, Which one you gon’ follow? Which one you gon’ be?  
  
**[Verse 2]** Then came the second gift, straight from the fallen crew, They showed us secret arts, and what power could do, Taught us how to build towers high in the air, Taught us how to rule the world without a care, But that power came heavy, and it came with a cost, 'Cause when you chase the crown, yo, your soul can get lost, We built the pyramids, but forgot who we are, Blinded by ambition, couldn’t see we’ve gone too far.  
  
**[Chorus]** Two gifts from the skies, you know we gotta choose, One leads to power, but the other? Never lose, Knowledge is a weapon, but wisdom’s the key, Which one you gon’ follow? Which one you gon’ be?  
  
**[Bridge]** We were flyin’ so high, thought we’d touch the divine, But the higher we climbed, the more we crossed the line, The wise ones they cried, as we fell to our knees, Forgot about the love, now we’re begging for peace, But some still remember the path to the light, They turned from the chaos, they turned to what’s right, They lifted each other, yeah, they built with their hearts, Not with bricks or with money, but compassion as art.  
  
**[Verse 3]** So now we at a crossroads, the future’s in sight, Do we chase after power or embrace the inner light? Knowledge without love, man, that’s a disaster, But wisdom with compassion, that’s how you be the master, We rebuildin' from the ashes, and we raisin' the vibes, No more divisions, just connection worldwide, So take a look around, what path you gon' choose? You wanna build forever? Then you gotta share the truth.  
  
**[Chorus]** Two gifts from the skies, you know we gotta choose, One leads to power, but the other? Never lose, Knowledge is a weapon, but wisdom’s the key, Which one you gon’ follow? Which one you gon’ be?  
  
**[Outro]** Yeah, it’s up to you now, the message is clear, Build with your heart, not with power or fear, From the ancient past to the future untold, It’s the wisdom and love that’ll make you bold. Two gifts, two roads, one chance to see, Only compassion gon' set us free.
