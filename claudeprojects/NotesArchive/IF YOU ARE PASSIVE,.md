IF YOU ARE PASSIVE,  
YOU WILL  
SUFFER IN EVERY  
UNDERTAKING  
AND YOU WILL  
NOT FEEL FREE, BEING  
IMPRISONED  
FROM YOUR  
LIMITS BECAUSE OF  
YOUR PASSIVITY. <OK!  
I WILL DO MY  
BEST BECAUSE  
WHATEVER I HAVE TO  
DO WILL BE FOR  
MY GOOD.> <I  
WILL EFFORT EVEN  
MORE FOR MY FAMILY  
AND MY FRIENDS.>  
WHEN YOU  
SPONTANEOUSLY CHOOSE  
TO BE POSITIVE,  
YOU WILL FEEL  
FREE.
