# The King of Sutras  
  
Like the ocean vast that claims all streams,  
Like Sumeru rising above earthly dreams,  
The Lotus stands supreme and bright,  
A beacon through the endless night[1].  
  
As Shakra rules the realms above,  
This teaching flows with boundless love.  
Like Brahma's care for beings all,  
It guides each soul that hears its call[7].  
  
Above disciples' reaching hands,  
Like moon among the starlit bands,  
This single truth illuminates  
The path through wisdom's golden gates[12].  
  
As sunrise breaks through darkness deep,  
This sutra's light makes shadows weep.  
A single vehicle to show  
The truths all beings need to know[1].  
  
Through skillful means it points the way,  
Beyond birth, death, and mortal sway.  
The Buddha's highest teaching shines,  
Through parables and sacred lines[7][12].  
  
In every word, in every page,  
A power flows from age to age.  
The king of sutras, pure and true,  
Reveals what all must journey through[1].  
  
Like lotus rising from the mud,  
This wisdom blooms in sacred flood,  
Transforming all who hear its voice,  
Making enlightenment their choice[6].
