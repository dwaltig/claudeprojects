Verse 1:  
In a world that spins   
In a world that spins   
without a pause,   
without a pause,   
the mysteries run deep,  
In every twist of fate and chance,   
In every twist of fate and chance,   
the secrets that we keep.  
The fire of knowledge gleams so bright,   
The fire of knowledge gleams so bright,   
a beacon in the night,  
Searching for that cosmic dance,   
Searching for that cosmic dance,   
for truth within our sight.  
  
Chorus:  
Understand the rhythm,   
Understand the rhythm,   
the oceans' mighty swell,  
The mountains rise stately,   
The mountains rise stately,   
with many tales to tell.  
Embrace the will to learn,   
Embrace the will to learn,   
dive into the unknown,  
In blues we find our solace,   
In blues we find our solace,   
in blues the truth is shown.  
  
Verse 2:  
The human mind,   
The human mind,   
an endless sea,   
an endless sea,   
navigates the stars,  
Grasping strings of reality,   
Grasping strings of reality,   
from Earth to far-off Mars.  
In blues we sing of wisdom found,   
In blues we sing of wisdom found,   
and bridges gently mended,  
In every note a piece of truth,   
In every note a piece of truth,   
our spirits blended.  
our spirits blended.  
  
Chorus:  
Understand the rhythm,   
Understand the rhythm,

The mountains rise stately,   
The mountains rise stately,   
with many tales to tell.  
Embrace the will to learn,   
Embrace the will to learn,   
dive into the unknown,  
In blues we find our solace,   
In blues we find our solace,   
in blues the truth is shown.  
in blues the truth is shown.
