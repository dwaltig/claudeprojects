# Unseen Power Rollin'  
  
Unseen Power Rollin’ is a blues-soaked folk tune that draws from a deep well of human resilience. Like thunder we hear but cannot see, the song evokes an inner force that carries us through life’s storms—a strength invisible yet undeniable.  
  
Rooted in ancient teachings, the lyrics insist that this power isn’t some distant miracle. It’s forged through steady, patient practice, the kind of quiet, daily work that builds courage and compassion grain by grain. The chorus drives it home: true fortitude is cultivated, not granted.  
The verses wander through a “troubled world” and an “earthly realm of struggles,” echoing the Buddhist vision of Jambudvīpa—a landscape where hardship and spiritual possibility meet. Here, the song reminds us, ordinary life itself is the sacred ground where transformation ripens.  
  
Ultimately, Unseen Power Rollin’ is a celebration of our own latent wisdom and strength. It calls us to hear that inner thunder, to recognize that the unseen power is no outside gift but the awakening of our own deepest nature. Let the groove carry you, and feel that hidden current roll through your soul.  
  
Lyrics:   
Verse 1  
In a world of trouble, storms keep rollin’ in,  
Holdin’ my spirit steady, through the howl and din.  
Dark clouds gather, cold rain starts to fall,  
Still I find that hidden strength when I give my all.  
  
Chorus  
Oh, that unseen power, deep inside my soul,  
Like thunder rumblin’ sky-high, a story to be told.  
No magic trick, no hand from up above—  
Just a steady, patient practice, born of human love.  
  
Verse 2  
Some folks call it focus, a quiet word I breathe,  
A way to keep my footing when the road turns mean.  
It breaks old habits, lifts me when I’m down,  
Planting quiet peace right here in this weary town.  
  
Chorus  
Oh, that unseen power, deep inside my soul,  
Like thunder rumblin’ sky-high, a story to be told.  
No magic trick, no hand from up above—  
Just a steady, patient practice, born of human love.  
  
Bridge  
It ain’t a handout, no easy gift to claim,  
You gotta walk the long road, through the wind and rain.  
Grow that fearless courage, let compassion shine,  
A living stream of goodness, making every moment divine.  
  
Verse 3  
This rough-and-tumble world is where the real work’s done,  
Every breath a footstep under the rising sun.  
Not escaping hardship, but meeting it head-on,  
Finding strength within to keep on till the dawn.  
  
Chorus  
Oh, that unseen power, deep inside my soul,  
Like thunder rumblin’ sky-high, a story to be told.  
No magic trick, no hand from up above—  
Just a steady, patient practice, born of human love.  
  
Outro  
Yeah, that steady, patient practice sets the spirit free.  
It’s the wellspring of true power—for you, for me.  
Keep on walkin’, keep on risin’, let that thunder roll,  
Unseen power, ever cleansing, ever whole.
