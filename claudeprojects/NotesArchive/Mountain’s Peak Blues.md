# Mountain’s Peak Blues  
  
You’ve NEVER heard a song like this before! I’m so stoked to finally share “Mountain’s Peak Blues” with you all. This track is a wild ride – think country blues with a mythological twist, featuring the actual voices of Apollo and Athena! 🤯 Yep, you read that right! These two deliver a duet for the ages over a backdrop of slide guitar, stand-up bass, harmonica, and a chill drum beat.  
“Mountain’s Peak Blues” is all about the different journeys we take in life to get to the same destination. 🙏 It’s about understanding that we might be on different paths, but we’re all climbing toward the same light. Inspired by the Lotus Sutra and the idea that the view from the top is the same no matter how you get there.  
Hit play, close your eyes, and let the music take you on a journey. ✨ Slide guitar licks to break your heart, Athena’s harmonies to soothe your soul, and Apollo’s vocals to send you to the heavens! 😇

(Verse 1) (Fingerpicked guitar, slow tempo) We climb the paths, so many ways Through tangled thorns and hazy days Each step we take, though paths diverge Up to that peak, where spirits surge  
  
(Verse 2) A river flows, its waters wide To join the ocean’s endless tide The names we speak, the songs we sing All echoes of that one big ring  
  
(Chorus) Oh, different trails, a weary climb But at the peak, there ain’t no bind Your truth is yours, and mine is mine Same view, baby, under that sunshine  
  
(Verse 3) A lamp for darkness, a guide for fear A voice that whispers, “I am near” The scriptures call, the sutras plead To quench our thirst, to plant the seed  
  
(Verse 4) The Tao flows soft, like morning dew Its wisdom ancient, ever new The Gita chants of dharma’s way While prophets speak of love each day  
  
(Chorus) Oh, different trails, a weary climb But at the peak, there ain’t no bind Your truth is yours, and mine is mine Same view, baby, under that sunshine  
  
(Bridge) The mountain waits, so stark and high Beyond the clouds, beyond the sky No room for hate, no need to lie Just truth and love to mystify  
  
(Verse 5) The Lotus blooms in every heart Its petals vast, a brand new start It tells us all can reach the shore No soul is lost forevermore  
  
(Chorus) (Full power, all instruments joining) Oh, different trails, a weary climb But at the peak, there ain’t no bind Your truth is yours, and mine is mine Same view, baby, under that sunshine  
  
(Outro) And in that place where silence sings,  
We’ll find the source of all these things:  
One boundless love that sets us free—  
The mountain’s peak for you and me.  
  
  
Imagine, Apollo and Athena standing back-to-back on a misty mountain peak. Apollo holds a golden lyre reimagined as a slide guitar, while Athena cradles a shimmering harmonica.  
Backdrop: A twilight sky with the sun setting on one side (Apollo’s domain) and the moon rising on the other (representing Athena’s wisdom), symbolizing the duality of their perspectives.  
Foreground: Silhouettes of musical instruments - a stand-up bass, drum kit, and various guitars - creating a border around the image, emphasizing the musical nature of the collaboration.  
Style: A blend of realistic painting and abstract elements, reminiscent of classic blues album covers from the 1960s and 70s. This style would give a timeless feel while also nodding to the mythological aspect of the characters.  
Color Palette: Rich, warm tones of gold, deep blue, and earthy browns to evoke both the celestial nature of the gods and the grounded feel of blues music.
