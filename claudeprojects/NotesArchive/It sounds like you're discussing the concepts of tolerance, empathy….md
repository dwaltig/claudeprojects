It sounds like you're discussing the concepts of tolerance, empathy, and community support within Buddhism, specifically within the teachings of Nichiren Daishonin. This can be interpreted as a principle of "protecting one another", which is a key aspect in many religious and philosophical teachings.  
  
Daishonin's teachings emphasize the importance of recognizing and appreciating the interconnectedness of all beings. In this context, overlooking small mistakes made by others can be seen as a way of fostering compassion and maintaining harmony within the community.   
  
Just as we support and protect our fellow believers, they in turn act as protective forces in our environment, offering support and protection in return. This creates a reciprocal relationship based on mutual understanding, respect, and care, which is beneficial for the community and individual spiritual growth.  
  
Remember, it's important to balance this principle with accountability and open communication. Ignoring larger issues or ongoing harmful behavior isn't conducive to a healthy community or personal growth. This teaching should not be interpreted as an encouragement to ignore serious wrongdoings, but rather as a call for compassion in dealing with minor flaws and mistakes.
