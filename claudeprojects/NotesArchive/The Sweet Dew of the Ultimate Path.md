# The Sweet Dew of the Ultimate Path  
  
The Hearers walked a path of quiet rest,  
Believing Arhat status was the best.   
The Three Great Vehicles held separate ways,  
Defined by limits through the passing days.  
But in the Lotus, a new light defined  
The single truth that binds all humankind.  
  
O, Bright-Lamp-of-Wisdom, shining true and deep  
You wake the seeds that every being keeps.  
The paths before were Skillful Means (Upāya) drawn,  
To guide the seekers to the coming dawn—   
For all provision is surpassed and done,  
Within the One Vehicle where all are one.   
  
In Chapter Nine, the two thousand stood,  
Learners and Adepts, hoping for the Good.   
They sought the Prophecy (Vyākaraṇa) from your tongue6  
The final guarantee to young and old,  
That limited Nirvana could not hold,  
For Buddha-nature is a boundless sphere,  
And ultimate enlightenment is near.   
  
When that great promise was at last conferred,  
Unfettered joy transformed the written word.  
They leaped in awe, affirming what they heard,  
Their hearts were filled with bliss beyond compare,  
"As if sprinkled with sweet dew" in the air.   
This sacred Amṛta, the taste of grace,  
Affirmed the eternal life in every face.  
  
This is the meaning of Completeness shown,  
That all possess the potential to be known  
As Buddhas, whole, transcendent, brave, and free  
Engaged in boundless, deep humanity.  
The joy of one becomes the call for all,  
To answer wisdom's clear, inspiring call.
