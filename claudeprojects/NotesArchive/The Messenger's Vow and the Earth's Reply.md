## The Messenger's Vow and the Earth's Reply  
  
We are the Messengers, who stood before the Throne,   
From distant lands we came, the *Ekayāna* known.   
The Buddha asked: Who guards the Dharma's sacred law,   
When the dark age descends, bringing ruin and flaw?   
We knelt before the light, our thousand hearts aflame,   
And pledged our lives as fuel for the holy name.  
“We are fearless before multitudes,” we cried,   
A mantle of assurance, *Abhaya*, our guide.    
  
We knew the price of truth, the suffering foretold,   
To preach the wondrous Sūtra, brighter than pure gold.   
We knew the **Three Great Foes**, the arrogant and sly,   
The false priest, the skeptic, the envy in the eye.    
  
"We care nothing for our bodies or lives," we swore,   
Anxious for the Way alone, and nothing ever more.    
  
But a secret tide runs deep beneath the Saha plane,   
Where karmic threads are spun, through joy and endless pain.   
Our dedication, bright, was measured, still defined—   
A sincere, **"superficial nature"** left behind.    
  
For the deepest, troubled world, salvation is not earned,   
But born of eternal ties, from which the heart is learned.  
The World Honored One declined the vows we humbly placed,   
And the earth itself broke open, though no time was wasted.   
For from the dust and rock, His **true disciples** rose,   
The Bodhisattvas of the Earth, who conquer all our woes.   
They carry in their essence the profound connection deep,   
The only ones ordained the final vow to keep.    
  
The difference is the soil, the tie that binds the core,   
To finish what began, and teach forevermore.
