# From Arhat's Peace to Buddha's Embrace  
  
A Lotus blooms, a Sūtra grand and true,   
Mahayana's heart, for all, for me, for you.   
Its revolutionary message, compassion's deep embrace,   
Buddhahood's potential for every time and place.  
  
Through skillful means, the Buddha wisely taught,   
His adaptive wisdom, for liberation sought.   
Innumerable parables, like rain on fertile ground,   
To varied capacities, the Dharma's truth is found.  
  
Like children lured from a burning house, perilous and grim,   
To One Vehicle's safety, the light beyond the brim.   
The Prodigal Son, lost, then found, his worth made known,   
His inherent Buddha-nature, a seed deeply sown.   
The Medicinal Herbs, each drinks the single rain,   
Each thrives according, easing life's deep pain.  
  
Subhūti, Kāśyapa, Kātyāyana, Maudgalyāyana, old and wise...   
From Arhat's peace, to joy in tear-filled eyes...   
Their lesser vehicle, a provisional guide,   
Now Bodhisattvas, with nothing left to hide.   
  
Enlightenment highest, their prophecy unfurled,   
Buddhahood universal, for all the weary world.  
  
To expound the Dharma in perfect freedom, is His way,   
No dogmas bind, from truth they cannot stray.   
The true aspect of phenomena, fully seen,   
From Buddha's own mind, a practice, pure and keen.   
  
Non-abiding nirvana, a compassionate art,   
To engage in samsara, with an open heart.   
For others' benefit, our own strength will grow,   
A Bodhisattva's path, where wisdom's waters flow.  
  
A beacon of hope, this Sūtra's radiant light,   
Transforming hearts, from darkness into light.   
Collective well-being, the ultimate, true aim,   
A living Dharma, forever to proclaim.
