Since "loving tricks" fits our "blues vernacular" project perfectly but isn't a standard academic term, we might want to frame it as our interpretation of *Upaya*.  
## *Example usage:* "This mirrors what the *Lotus Sutra* calls 'skillful means' (*upaya*)—or what we might call the 'loving tricks' of the father..."

The idea that figures like Moses and Harriet Tubman used "holy deception" or "trickster" tactics (often called "Signifying") to liberate their people is a core tenet of **Black Liberation Theology** and **Blues/Spirituals scholarship**.

While the specific phrasing in our paper ("I believe in the Bible and I sing the Bible...") appears to be a summary or paraphrase of her sentiments rather than a verbatim passage found in digital archives of the book, the themes of "songs of my people" and the distinction between Blues (despair) and Gospel (hope) are the central thesis of her memoir.  
Here is the citation for her autobiography in **Chicago Style (16th ed.)**:

The most famous genuine quote from this book regarding "hope" is her distinction between her music and the Blues:  
*"Blues are the songs of despair, but gospel songs are the songs of hope."*  
If you want to be safe with the "songs of my people" phrasing, you can frame it as:  
*"In her autobiography, she describes her music as a ministry, noting that gospel songs are 'the songs of hope'..."*
