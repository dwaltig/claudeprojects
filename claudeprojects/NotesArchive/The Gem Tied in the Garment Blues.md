# The Gem Tied in the Garment Blues  
(Style: Deep, resonant acoustic guitar rhythm; melancholy verses, shifting to ecstatic, affirmed power in the chorus.)  
  
(Verse 1: The Heavy Ground and the Precursor)   
I was sitting on the hard earth, every joint began to ache.   
I was seeking simple peace, for the old law’s sake.   
The Lord went into stillness, meditation deep and vast.   
And then the Buddha-land itself, it moved too fast.   
It started groan-in', six ways it shook that day:   
Trembled in reverence, then danced and it fell way.   
Felt that divine energy shift beneath my heel,   
I knew a mighty secret was about to peel.  
  
(Chorus: The Immediate Sensory Revelation)   
Oh, the Stūpa rose, five hundred yojanas high   
Gold and lapis, piercing through the sky   
Sandalwood and incense filling up my lungs   
The ancient voice inside sang out its song:   
"Excellent! Excellent! Lord Śākyamuni!"   
Now I know the truth is here for me  
  
(Verse 2: Sight and Adornment)   
I looked upon that Tower, it was sparkling, beautiful, and vast.   
Made of seven precious substances, shining far and fast.   
The emeralds and red coral burning in the light.   
Jeweled garlands hanging, a heavenly sight.   
The gods from up in paradise strewed down their floral rain.   
White cloth whirled down in thousands, washing away the pain.   
The banners and the triumphal streamers caught the wind,   
Told me this wasn't Nirvana, this was the truth defined.  
  
(Chorus: The Immediate Sensory Revelation)   
Oh, the Stūpa arose, five hundred yojanas high!   
Gold and lapis lazuli piercing the dark sky.   
That scent of Xanthochymus and sandal, filled my lung.   
Then the great, deep voice inside, that celestial song.   
It cried out: "Excellent, excellent, Lord Sākyamuni!"   
Now I know the truth is coming for me.  
  
(Verse 3: Auditory Wonders)   
The jeweled chimes and bells were ringing, sweet, tender, and clear.   
The melody flowed through the world, quieting my fear.   
I heard celestial angels say my name.   
Then the sound of tymbal drums announcing wisdom's flame.   
And later, when the Buddhas sat in their truth,   
I heard the great sound of the finger-snaps for proof.   
A mighty cosmic racket, across all ten embrace,   
Affirming one Great Vehicle in this sacred place.  
  
(Bridge: The Hidden Gem and the New Path)   
I thought I was satisfied, begging for my bread,   
A pauper on the low road, full of ancient dread.   
But the Master, knowing secrets I could never see,   
He tied a priceless gem deep inside of me.   
That gem of all-knowing wisdom,   
I acquired without longing or plea.   
I was blind until this teaching gave me sight.   
Now I wear the robe of patience, and I stand in the light.   
I'm no disciple, Lord, I'm destined for the King's throne.  
  
(Chorus: The Immediate Sensory Revelation)   
Oh, the Stūpa arose, five hundred yojanas high!   
Gold and lapis lazuli piercing the dark sky.   
Sandalwood and incense filling up my lungs  
Then the great, deep voice inside, that celestial song.   
It cried out: "Excellent, excellent, Lord Sākyamuni!"   
Now I know the truth is coming for me.
