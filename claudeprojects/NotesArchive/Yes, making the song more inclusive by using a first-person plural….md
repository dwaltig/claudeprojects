Yes, making the song more inclusive by using a first-person plural ("we," "our") and second-person ("you," "your") perspective could deepen the connection with listeners. This approach invites them to see themselves as part of the journey, making the lyrics both personal and universal. By blending these perspectives, we can create a song that feels more communal and instructive, guiding listeners through the stages of the bardo with a shared experience.  
  
### **Revised Lyrics for "Journey Through the Bardos"**  
  
#### **Verse 1: The Bardo of Death (Chikhai Bardo)**  
*Lyrics:*  
When our breath fades away and the light starts to dim,    
We find ourselves at a doorway, where the journey begins.    
In the Bardo of Death, we hear the shadows call,    
Hold on to your light, don’t let the darkness fall.    
  
#### **Chorus:**  
*Lyrics:*  
Oh, through the Bardos, we wander and roam,    
From death to rebirth, together, we’re home.    
In the dark and the light, we all find our way,    
Through sorrow and hope, we face a new day.    
  
#### **Verse 2: The Bardo of Reality (Chonyid Bardo)**  
*Lyrics:*  
You’ll see visions of deities, both peaceful and fierce,    
They come to confront all the fears you hold dear.    
The clear light shines bright; don’t let it fade away,    
In the mirrors of the mind, truth and illusion play.    
  
#### **Bridge:**  
*Lyrics:*  
Hear the voices calling, guiding us through,    
Trust in the wisdom, the light inside you.    
Together, we journey, surrender to grace,    
In the cycle of life, we all find our place.    
  
#### **Verse 3: The Bardo of Becoming (Sidpa Bardo)**  
*Lyrics:*  
In the Bardo of Becoming, a new life begins,    
Karma shapes our journey as the cycle spins.    
A spark becomes a flame, in the womb, it grows,    
From sorrow to hope, the river of life flows.    
  
#### **Chorus (Reprise):**  
*Lyrics:*  
Oh, through the Bardos, we wander and roam,    
From death to rebirth, together, we’re home.    
In the dark and the light, we all find our way,    
Through sorrow and hope, we face a new day.    
  
#### **Outro:**  
*Lyrics:*  
We walk this path, the unknown and the known,    
Through the Bardos, together, we are never alone.    
From death to new life, the journey renews,    
In each breath we take, our spirit breaks through.
