*(Verse 1)*    
In the silence of dawn  
When the world is still drawn  
To shadows and sleep  
These words that I keep  
Nam Myoho Renge Kyo  
Like waves they flow  
Nam Myoho Renge Kyo  
  
*(Chorus)*  
Nam Myoho Renge Kyo  
Each syllable unfolds like a flower  
Nam Myoho Renge Kyo  
Every moment holds this power  
Through joy and through pain  
This truth remains  
Nam Myoho Renge Kyo  
  
*(Verse 2)*  
In the midst of the crowd  
Where life speaks aloud  
Each step that I take  
Each choice that I make  
Nam Myoho Renge Kyo  
This path I know  
Nam Myoho Renge Kyo  
  
*(Bridge)*  
Mystic law of cause and effect  
Turning like the earth  
Every breath connects  
To infinite worth  
In this moment's space  
Find endless grace  
  
*(Final Chorus)*  
Nam Myoho Renge Kyo  
Each syllable unfolds like a flower  
Nam Myoho Renge Kyo  
Every moment holds this power  
Through changes we face  
In time and space  
Nam Myoho Renge Kyo
