Lyrics  
(Verse 1)  
In the shadow of the street, the wicked stand tall,  
Got their wealth and power, but they’re bound to fall.  
They curse the weak, with hearts made of stone,  
Sayin’, “Where’s your help? You’re all alone.”  
But in their blindness, they just can’t see,  
The hands of karma work silently.  
  
(Chorus)  
O Lord of Love, O Awakened, wise,  
You see the tears in those silent eyes.  
The Compassionate One, hears their plea,  
Guidin’ every soul to be free.  
  
(Verse 2)  
The proud rise up, the meek, they fall,  
But in your light, you lift ‘em all.  
An Awakened vow, breakin’ chains of steel,  
Turnin’ hatred ‘round, teachin’ hearts to feel.  
Justice flows, though it takes its time,  
Like a river runnin’—truth so fine.  
  
(Chorus)  
O Lord of Love, O Awakened, wise,  
You see the tears in those silent eyes.  
The Compassionate One, hears their plea,  
Guidin’ every soul to be free.  
  
(Bridge)  
The poor find rest, in your gentle hands,  
Like waves that crash on distant lands.  
The wicked will bow, their shame will rise,  
As love and truth light up the skies.  
  
(Chorus)  
O Lord of Love, O Awakened, wise,  
You see the tears in those silent eyes.  
The Compassionate One, hears their plea,  
Guidin’ every soul to be free.  
  
(Outro)  
And the law of love will rise,  
With the Dharma bright across the skies.  
The hands of karma move silently,  
Bringin’ light and peace for all to see.  
Bringin’ light and peace for all to see.
