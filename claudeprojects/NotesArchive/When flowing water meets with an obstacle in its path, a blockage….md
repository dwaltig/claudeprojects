When flowing water meets with an obstacle in its path, a blockage in its journey, it pauses. It increases in volume and strength, filling up in front of the obstacle and eventually spilling past it. OBSTACLES do not spring suddenly in the way of the rushing water but are, in fact, inherent in the chosen path.  
  
Like flowing water, we pause before obstacles, increase in volume and strength, filling up in front of the obstacle and eventually spilling past it easily achieving our goals.
