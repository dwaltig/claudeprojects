**Faltering Voice’s Song”**  
  
*Verse 1:*  
*Verse 1:*  
On the shoulder of a giant,  
I saw the universe unfold,  
With every step he took,  
A thousand stars turned to gold.  
He spoke not with words,  
But with a silent, subtle hum,  
Teaching me the Dharma,  
With the sound of a beating drum.  
  
*Chorus:*  
*Chorus:*  
Faltering Voice, oh, so grand,  
He showed me the wonder of this land,  
Through vibrations deep and clear,  
He taught me how to see and hear.  
  
*Verse 2:*  
*Verse 2:*  
He carried a university,  
On his mighty shoulder wide,  
Students from the farthest realms,  
Gathered by his side.  
He whispered through the cosmos,  
In a language without sound,  
Taught me to use my spirit eyes,  
To see what can’t be found.  
  
*Chorus:*  
*Chorus:*  
Faltering Voice, oh, so wise,  
Guiding me through the open skies,  
Through the Sutra, one by one,  
He showed me how the path is spun.  
  
*Bridge:*  
*Bridge:*  
With Plato, Socrates, and the stars,  
He guided me through near and far,  
Encouraging each step I’d take,  
In the universe, awake.  
  
*Verse 3:*  
*Verse 3:*  
He could travel with a thought,  
From here to worlds unseen,  
Showing me the Dharma’s path,  
In every place we’ve been.  
He said, “Continue on, my friend,  
Read each chapter, every day,”  
And on his shoulder, high above,  
I found my way.  
  
*Chorus:*  
*Chorus:*  
Faltering Voice, oh, so strong,  
Singing to me a cosmic song,  
Through the Sutra, verse by verse,  
He helped me lift the universe.  
  
*Outro:*  
*Outro:*  
Now I journey on my own,  
With his lessons in my heart,  
Knowing that the Dharma’s sound,  
Will never drift apart.  
Faltering Voice, forever near,  
Guiding me through love, not fear.
