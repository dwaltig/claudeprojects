[Lyrics]  
  
[Verse 1:]  
I walked the path of shadows,   
through the valley of my mind,  
Demons rising up in fury,   
fierce and unkind,  
Their faces filled with anger,   
eyes like burning flames,  
I knew I had to face them,   
or I’d never be the same.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, the shadows in the darkness,   
twist and turn with fright,  
But with a single thought,   
I can bring them into light,  
Transforming all my poison   
into medicine so true,  
The demons turn to angels,   
and my soul is born anew.  
  
[Verse 2:]  
In the darkest of the valley,   
I saw the Light so clear,  
But fear and doubt came creeping,   
whispering in my ear,  
I saw my anger rising,   
a storm across the sea,  
But I knew that I could calm it   
if I set my spirit free.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[Bridge:]  
Oh, the power in a moment,   
a thought can change it all,  
From anger into wisdom,   
from a rise to a fall,  
I saw the angels smiling,   
faces full of grace,  
And I knew I’d found the courage   
to meet them face to face.  
  
[Verse 3:]  
I felt the pull of desire,   
trying to lead me astray,  
But I knew that true compassion   
was the only way,  
I faced my fears head-on,   
turned them into my friend,  
And with every step I’m taking,   
I’m closer to the end.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, the shadows in the darkness,   
twist and turn with fright,  
But with a single thought,   
I can bring them into light,  
Transforming all my poison   
into medicine so true,  
The demons turn to angels,   
and my soul is born anew.  
  
[Verse 4:]  
Now I walk with serenity,   
my mind as calm as glass,  
Every encounter teaches me,   
every trial I pass,  
The angels now are dancing,   
they’re no longer a fright,  
I’ve learned to see their faces   
in the clear morning light.
