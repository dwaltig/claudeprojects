# SoundCloud Description: "One Word of Praise"  
**One Word of Praise**  
What if everything you've been told about spiritual progress is backwards?  
This song came from reading an ancient Buddhist text—the Lotus Sutra—that completely flips our understanding of how transformation happens. We're taught that meaningful change requires years of effort, countless hours of practice, immense sacrifice. Grind long enough and maybe, just maybe, you'll get somewhere.  
But the sutra says something radical: a single moment of genuine joy, one word of heartfelt praise, can carry more weight than a lifetime of striving. Not because effort doesn't matter, but because the *quality* of your intention—that flash of pure, open-hearted recognition—connects you to something timeless.  
It's not about what you know. It's about how you feel when truth lands.  
I wanted to capture that paradox in a bluesy folk song—the weariness of the long climb and the sudden liberation of realizing the door was never locked. Fingerpicked guitar, slide guitar crying in the background, a little gospel organ lifting the chorus. It's meant to feel like sitting on a porch at dusk, finally understanding something you've carried for too long.  
The song asks: What if the greatest spiritual moment of your life isn't somewhere in the distant future, but available right now, in your very next breath of authentic praise?  
**Inspired by Chapter 18 of the Lotus Sutra: "The Merits of a Person Who Rejoices"**  
  
*If this song moves you, that moment of feeling—that's not nothing. That might be everything.*

Lyrics:   
[Verse 1]  
I been climbing this mountain for so many years  
Counting every step, every prayer, every tear  
Thinking I gotta earn my way through heaven's door  
With a lifetime of labor and a whole lot more  
But the old sutra whispers something strange to my ear  
  
[Chorus]  
One word of praise, that's all it takes  
One moment of joy when your heart breaks awake  
One word of praise to every Buddha that's been  
Every Buddha that is, every Buddha again  
One word of praise—that's the gate, that's the key  
One moment of joy sets the whole cosmos free  
  
[Verse 2]  
They say you can't think your way to the promised land  
The wise men try but they don't understand  
So forget what you know, just feel what is true  
The rarest flower ain't the teaching—it's you  
With your heart wide open and your willing hand  
  
[Chorus]  
One word of praise, that's all it takes  
One moment of joy when your heart breaks awake  
One word of praise to every Buddha that's been  
Every Buddha that is, every Buddha again  
One word of praise—that's the gate, that's the key  
One moment of joy sets the whole cosmos free  
  
[Bridge - Sparse, questioning]  
The scarcity ain't in the signal, friend  
It's in the static filling up your head  
Can you tune your receiver to the right frequency?  
Can you cut through the noise and just let yourself be?  
  
[Verse 3]  
Your intention's a time machine, can't you see?  
When you aim at the truth, you're already free  
That single word echoes through eternity  
Past and future bow down to your honesty  
You're standing at the start of the Bodhisattva's road  
  
[Chorus - Full, celebratory]  
One word of praise, that's all it takes  
One moment of joy when your heart breaks awake  
One word of praise to every Buddha that's been  
Every Buddha that is, every Buddha again  
One word of praise—that's the gate, that's the key  
One moment of joy sets the whole cosmos free  
  
[Outro - Return to intimate]  
So what if the greatest thing you'll ever do  
Is waiting in the very next moment for you?  
Just one word of praise  
One simple word of praise  
Hallelujah—one word of praise  
  
[End with sustained resolution]
