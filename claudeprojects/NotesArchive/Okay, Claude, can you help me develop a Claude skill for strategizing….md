Okay, Claude, can you help me develop a Claude skill for strategizing job searches? The skill should provide guidance on analyzing job postings, uncovering hidden insights, advising on interviewing techniques to match skills with job requirements, and offering strategies for developing necessary skills to target the job. Additionally, it should include guidance on searching the web to create a specific job targeting strategy, such as using LinkedIn DMs, particular social profiles, examining company culture to identify unconventional opportunities, and employing video cover letter strategies. The key is to creatively match candidate skills with the company profile to help the candidate stand out.
