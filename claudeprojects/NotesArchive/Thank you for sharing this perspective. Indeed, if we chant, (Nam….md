That's a beautiful perspective. The idea of transforming hardship into a source of spiritual growth is indeed a central tenet of this Buddhism. Our understanding can provide profound resilience and a sense of inner peace, regardless of the external circumstances. It's wonderful to hear that we've found such wisdom and strength through our practice. Keep going on your path, and may it continually lead us to deeper wisdom, compassion, and joy.
