Forgive me, I’m a novice and am thrilled to use the tools available to me. This song was a unique collaboration; a first. I started with a sample of SECMOS’ instrumental track and was so inspired to write the lyrics. Using an AI tool, I fed the AI the sample and lyrics, and it created a surprisingly strong initial composition. The very first output was so on target that I knew we had something special. This unique blend of human artistry and AI assistance resulted in a song that we're both incredibly proud of.
