I’ve just started this summer. I’m hoping with time it will improve.  
  
Tell me about the scams. I just got out of a meeting with a fake Interscope promoter. He sent a contract over Gmail.  
  
Last week it was with The Orchard. Again Gmail  
  
Even in reading the contract, too many red flags:  
  
1.	Gmail Address and Informality: Interscope Records would not use a generic email like Gmail for official business. Contracts would come from an official email domain (e.g., @interscope.com). The casual nature of communication is suspicious for a company of this scale.  
	2.	Vague Financial Promises: The promises of an upfront $10,000 for studio equipment, $40,000 for “personal upkeep,” and an annual income of $1,000,000 are extremely unusual and unrealistic for a standard music contract, especially for an artist who hasn’t yet proven commercial success under the label. Reputable labels typically provide advances, but they are carefully structured and detailed.  
	3.	Project Tracker Requirement: The requirement to purchase a “project tracker” for $500 from the label’s vendor is highly suspicious. No legitimate label would require an artist to pay for something like this as a condition for receiving funds. This is a common tactic used in scams to extract money from individuals upfront.  
	4.	Strange Disbursement Terms: The clause about “no funds shall be disbursed without access to a project tracker” raises another red flag. Legitimate record deals do not make disbursements contingent on purchasing arbitrary equipment.  
	5.	Lack of Clear Payment Terms: The contract lacks clear, specific terms on royalty splits, recoupment, and other key financial terms that are standard in real music contracts.
