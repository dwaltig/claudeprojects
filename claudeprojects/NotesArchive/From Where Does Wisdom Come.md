Wisdom flows from many streams,  
Life's rich tapestry of dreams,  
From moments lived and lessons learned,  
In every triumph, every turn.  
  
Through quiet reflection's gentle grace,  
In contemplation's sacred space,  
We find the threads of deeper knowing,  
Where seeds of wisdom start their growing.  
  
In voices of the wise and old,  
In stories shared, in truths retold,  
We gather pearls of ancient lore,  
To guide us on life's shifting shore.  
  
Knowledge gained through study's light,  
Books and tomes, both day and night,  
Yet wisdom's more than facts and figures,  
It's insight gained through broader triggers.  
  
Intuition, a silent guide,  
From depths within, where truths reside,  
A whisper from the soul's own core,  
Leading us to understand more.  
  
In faith and spirit's tender touch,  
In sacred texts that mean so much,  
We find a wisdom pure and bright,  
A beacon in the darkest night.  
  
Compassion's heart, empathy's gaze,  
Illuminate our chosen ways,  
For wisdom blooms where kindness grows,  
In every act, in love it shows.  
  
Through trials faced and battles fought,  
In challenges, our wisdom's wrought,  
Adversity, a teacher true,  
Forging strength from what we knew.  
  
So wisdom comes from varied streams,  
In life's rich weave, in quiet dreams,  
A gift of time, of heart, of mind,  
A treasure in our souls we find.
