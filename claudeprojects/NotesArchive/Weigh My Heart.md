(Verse 1) Yo, check the mic, one two, this ain't no game Soul's on fire, spirit callin' out your name Lord, hear my plea, these words ain't no facade Truth spills from my lips, breakin' down the charade This world's a battlefield, where justice goes astray But I seek your guidance, show me the righteous way  
(Chorus) Like a lotus bloom, risin' from the mire My vindication's comin', burnin' with holy fire Walk with me, Lord, on this Noble quest Compassion's the weapon, puttin' hate to the test  
(Verse 2) In the dead of night, when shadows start to creep Weigh my heart, Lord, let your wisdom run deep Refine my spirit, burn away the doubt Plant seeds of truth, let 'em blossom and sprout No empty promises, I live by your decree Walkin' the path of truth, eternally  
(Chorus) Like a lotus bloom, risin' from the mire My vindication's comin', burnin' with holy fire Walk with me, Lord, on this Noble quest Compassion's the weapon, puttin' hate to the test  
(Verse 3) Darkness surrounds me, whispers fill the air But your love's a shield, protectin' me with care Malice and envy, they try to bring me down But I find refuge in your grace, wearin' faith's crown  
(Chorus) Like a lotus bloom, risin' from the mire My vindication's comin', burnin' with holy fire Walk with me, Lord, on this Noble quest Compassion's the weapon, puttin' hate to the test  
(Bridge) Diamonds and gold, they fade away like dust But your light within, forever I trust Karma's a mirror, reflectin' all we do When the veil lifts, I'll be face to face with you  
(Chorus) Like a lotus bloom, risin' from the mire My vindication's comin', burnin' with holy fire Walk with me, Lord, on this Noble quest Compassion's the weapon, puttin' hate to the test  
(Outro) Lotus blooms forever, in your love's embrace Leadin' us to freedom, with everlasting grace. Word up.
