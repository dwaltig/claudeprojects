[Verse]  
The strength of kindness builds my home  
Forbearance clothes me tight  
In abstraction's peaceful arms  
I find the truth and light  
  
When faced with clods  
With sticks  
Or threats  
Remember me and stand  
My spirit stretches far and wide  
A guide through every land  
  
[Chorus]  
In whispers of the mountain air  
In the echoes of the deep  
My teachings flow through all who dare  
Their sacred oath to keep  
  
[Verse]  
In the quiet of the mountain air  
Where secrets whispered and dreams prepare  
My teachings flow through whispers deep  
In every soul  
A sacred oath to keep  
  
[Verse 2]  
On this path  
Brave ones unite  
Through darkness and distance  
We'll still find light  
My creations come  
A sight to see  
In every step  
I'll ensure you're never alone  
  
[Chorus]  
In whispers of the mountain air  
In the echoes of the deep  
My teachings flow through all who dare  
Their sacred oath to do.  
Their sacred oath to do.
