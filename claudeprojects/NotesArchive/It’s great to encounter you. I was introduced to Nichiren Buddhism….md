It’s great to encounter you. I was introduced to Nichiren Buddhism decades ago. I was a junior in college at Portland State University. I had just bought some groceries and walked out. A VW bus pulled up and strangers asked me if I wanted to join a road trip to Seattle, WA. I said cool, and jumped in. They told me they were going to a culture festival. Seattle was at least 4 hours away by car. We stopped at a small Buddhist temple and I watched this ceremony and was given a gohonzon. We went a college campus gymnasium and watched a colorful flags and cheerleading display. We drove back and my new friends made nice cabinet for the gohonzon and taught me gongyo. They said I could ask for anything and it will come true. It took 30 years to see my prayers answered that day. But, wow, what a wild experience. Now, I tell folks, I’m Lotus Born. Nichiren would be so proud.
