Lyrics:  
(Verse 1)  
Anya wandered 'cross the hills so green,  
Heart heavy with the troubles she'd seen.  
'Neath the banyan tree, an old woman wise,  
Spoke of karma's threads, beneath the skies.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, the tapestry of life, it weaves and it winds,  
Every action leaves its mark, every thought entwined.  
Karma's echo, dharma's call,  
In every heart, a story to enthrall.  
  
(Verse 2)  
"Anya, like a leaf, your actions paint the scene,  
Kindness blooms in beauty, while shadows intervene.  
Your dharma, a stone, your purpose ever true,  
When aligned with it, joy will renew."  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, the tapestry of life, it weaves and it winds,  
Every action leaves its mark, every thought entwined.  
Karma's echo, dharma's call,  
In every heart, a story to enthrall.  
  
(Verse 3)  
"Suffering of innocents, a mystery untold,  
But trust in the universe, its balance unfolds.  
Your power lies within, to heal and to mend,  
With compassion's touch, love's light extend."  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, the tapestry of life, it weaves and it winds,  
Every action leaves its mark, every thought entwined.  
Karma's echo, dharma's call,  
In every heart, a story to enthrall.  
  
(Bridge)  
Anya walked on, with purpose newfound,  
Kindness her song, on hearts' hallowed ground.  
Villagers saw the light in her eyes,  
Inspired by her spirit, reaching for the skies.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, the tapestry of life, it weaves and it winds,  
Every action leaves its mark, every thought entwined.  
Karma's echo, dharma's call,  
In every heart, a story to enthrall.  
  
(Outro)  
So let us weave with threads of gold,  
A tapestry of love, stories to be told.  
Karma's lessons, dharma's embrace,  
In every soul, a sacred space.
