Right now, I've written a letter to Joey Liao. In it, I summarized our past conversation where I brought up concerns about "hero worship" and my differing views on the Lotus Sutra versus The New Human Revolution. I also explained that I felt characterized as an "apostate" because of this. I made it clear that I'm still confused and disappointed about my name being removed from SGI records, especially since I'm so committed to the Buddha Dharma and my art. I'm hoping this letter finally gets me a clear explanation.  
My plan is to wait seven days for Joey's response. If I don't hear back by then, I'm going to reach out to the SGI-USA Central Territory Men's Division Leader in Chicago to try and get some clarity on my membership status.
