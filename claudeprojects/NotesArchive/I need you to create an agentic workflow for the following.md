# I need you to create an agentic workflow for the following:   
  
```
Cross-referencing claims - verifying that statements align with what my cited sources actually say
  - Logical coherence - identifying gaps in argumentation or unsupported leaps
  - Consistency checking - catching inconsistent terminology, tone shifts, or thematic repetitions
  - Quote scanning - flagging any passages that sound like they might need citations or verification
  - Structural review - checking whether the paper's architecture is sound (intro → argument development →
  conclusion)
  - Academic tone - catching any language that's too casual or potentially problematic for peer review
Audit for citations, claims that need sources, inconsistent phrasing, logical gaps, etc.
Identify the "weakest" parts of my argument that peer reviewers might challenge

Since we are making a claim about the interpretation of the crossroads (as karmic), it might be strong to add a second citation here from a scholar who discusses Johnson's lyrics (like Robert Palmer or James Cone) to back up our interpretation, rather than just citing the song itself. It would show that our reading is grounded in scholarship, not just our own opinion.
 * Action: If we have it, add a reference to Palmer [10] or Cone [33] in that same paragraph if they discuss Johnson. If not, the primary source (the song) is acceptable but slightly weaker.
