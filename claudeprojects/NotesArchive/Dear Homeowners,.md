**Dear Homeowners,**  
  
**We want to remind all residents about the importance of responsible pet ownership following a recent and unfortunate incident in which a dog chased and killed a cat. Ensuring the safety of both pets and people in our community is a shared responsibility, and we appreciate your cooperation in following these important guidelines:**  
  
**For Dog Owners:**  
**	•	Leash Requirement: All dogs must be on a leash and under control whenever they are outside your home or enclosed yard.**  
**	•	Secure Fencing: If your property has a fenced yard, ensure it is properly secured to prevent pets from escaping.**  
**	•	Supervision: Dogs should never be allowed to roam freely in common areas or other residents’ yards.**  
  
**Curb Your Pets: Please clean up after your pet immediately. Please dispose of waste properly.**  
  
**For Cat Owners:**  
**	•	Indoor Safety: Cats should not be left outdoors unsupervised or allowed to roam freely. Outdoor cats face risks from wildlife, traffic, and other animals, and they can also pose a threat to local ecosystems.**  
**	•	Safe Enclosures: If you allow your cat outside, please use a secure enclosure or harness to keep them safe.**  
  
**Community Responsibility:**  
**	•	If you witness an unleashed or aggressive pet, please report it to our Property Manager, Lynn Marticiuc.**  
**	•	If your pet is involved in an incident with another animal or resident, please notify the HOA immediately.**  
  
**By working together, we can ensure a safe and respectful living environment for all residents and their pets. Thank you for your cooperation in helping to maintain the well-being of our community.**  
  
**Sincerely,**  
**William Altig**  
**President**
