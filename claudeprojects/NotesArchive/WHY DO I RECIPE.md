WHY DO I RECIPE  
THE NAME OF MY  
OPINION, because of the  
curse of death with  
all of us, it is  
impossible not to  
move the celestial  
divinity, the positive force  
of the universe.  
Nichiren Daishonin  
wrote to one of  
his followers: <If  
someone is in a  
position to move the  
Buddha Shakyamuni,  
the lord of the teachings,  
it is impossible for  
the grass and the  
trees to respond  
to the water and  
remain firm.  
In the same way,  
when we talk to  
other people about  
a sincere prayer, we  
don't talk, we don't  
ask, we don't dare to  
talk about it.

earth page 65"
