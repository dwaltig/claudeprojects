# Why Do the Foolish Rage  
  
[Verse 1]  
[Verse 1]  
[Verse 1]  
[Verse 1]  
Why do the foolish rage,   
Why do the foolish rage,   
why do they dream so wild?  
Kings of dust rise up,   
Kings of dust rise up,   
throw truth into the fire.  
"Break these chains,"   
"Break these chains,"   
they cry, "old truths we'll deny."  
But the stars just laugh,   
But the stars just laugh,   
as karma's wheel turns high.

[Chorus]  
The universe sings   
The universe sings   
in echoes of truth,  
On the mountain of peace,   
On the mountain of peace,   
Dharma's word rings so smooth.  
"Seek wisdom,"   
"Seek wisdom,"   
it calls,   
it calls,   
through the winds,   
through the winds,   
through the night,  
"Awakening's yours,   
"Awakening's yours,   
if you step to the light."

Karma’s own hand,   
Karma’s own hand,   
weaving fate with strands,  
Pain they've sown themselves,   
Pain they've sown themselves,   
by their own commands.  
Yet high upon the crest,   
Yet high upon the crest,   
where the clear winds blow,  
The Dharma reigns supreme,   
The Dharma reigns supreme,   
in the light we grow.

The universe sings   
The universe sings   
in echoes of truth,  
On the mountain of peace,   
On the mountain of peace,   
Dharma's word rings so smooth.  
"Seek wisdom,"   
"Seek wisdom,"   
it calls, through the winds,   
it calls, through the winds,   
through the night,  
"Awakening's yours,   
"Awakening's yours,   
if you step to the light."

Be wise now, rulers, learn,   
Be wise now, rulers, learn,   
judges of earth,  
Walk the path of mindfulness,   
Walk the path of mindfulness,   
know what your truth is worth.  
Respect the wisdom old,   
Respect the wisdom old,   
like a treasure found,  
For blessed are they,   
For blessed are they,   
who on this wisdom ground.  
  
[Outro]  
  
Respect the wisdom old,   
Respect the wisdom old,   
like a treasure found,  
For blessed are they,   
For blessed are they,   
who on this wisdom ground.
