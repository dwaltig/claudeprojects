Lyrics:  
[Verse]  
Down by the river where the waters bend  
A fisherman sat with a net to mend  
A stranger came  
With fire in his eye  
Said  
"Cast it wide  
Don’t question why."  
  
[Verse 2]  
The fisherman said  
"I know my trade  
The catch is meager  
But it's honest paid."  
The stranger laughed  
“Let the river choose  
Free will’s a cage if you're born to lose."  
  
[Chorus]  
Throw the net where wisdom flows  
Follow the current where the truth bestows  
Free will’s the line you weave with care  
Skillful hands shape what grows there  
  
[Verse 3]  
The stranger seized the net  
Cast it afar  
Into deep waters  
Where the shadows spar  
The line pulled taut  
But his hands let slip  
The weight was too much  
And the net would rip  
  
[Verse 4]  
The fisherman rose  
With a steady hand  
Pulled the net back  
Brought the fish to land  
Said  
"It ain't the depth  
But the patience  
Friend  
The river gives  
When you learn to bend."  
  
[Chorus]  
Throw the net where wisdom flows  
Follow the current where the truth bestows  
Free will’s the line you weave with care  
Skillful hands shape what grows there
