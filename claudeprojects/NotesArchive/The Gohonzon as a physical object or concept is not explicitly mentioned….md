The Gohonzon, as conceptualized by Nichiren, is more a development of his interpretation and doctrinal innovation rather than a direct element from the sutra.  
Chapter 11 of the Lotus Sutra describes the appearance of the Treasure Tower and the ceremony in the air, symbolizing the unity of the historical Shakyamuni Buddha and the eternal cosmic Buddha aspect. This event is significant in the context of Mahayana Buddhism for its emphasis on the universal and eternal aspect of the Buddha, which transcends the historical figure of Shakyamuni. It's a profound teaching about the nature of enlightenment and the Buddha's eternal presence.  
However, Nichiren's concept of the Gohonzon, which he describes as the object of devotion embodying the eternal and intrinsic law of Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, is an interpretation that extends beyond the literal narrative of the Lotus Sutra. Nichiren extrapolated and expanded upon the themes and teachings of the sutra to develop his understanding and representation of the Gohonzon.
