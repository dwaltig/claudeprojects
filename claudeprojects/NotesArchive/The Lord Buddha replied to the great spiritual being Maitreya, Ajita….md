And then, after hearing the sermon, they go to a monastery, house, forest, street, village, town, or province with the specific intention of sharing the wisdom they have understood and heard, according to their ability. They share it with their parents, relatives, friends, acquaintances, or anyone else. If that person then joyfully accepts the teachings and shares them with another, and this process continues in succession until fifty people have heard and joyfully accepted the wisdom, then, Ajita, the fiftieth person, whether a young man or woman of noble character, will have accumulated a vast amount of merit connected with their joyful acceptance. Listen carefully, Ajita, for I will now explain this merit to you."⁠**
