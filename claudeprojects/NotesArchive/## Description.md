## Description  
"Precious Jewel (Buddha's Blues)" is a soulful fusion of Delta blues and contemporary folk, inspired by Buddhist teachings. The song narrates the spiritual journey of aged disciples who discover unexpected enlightenment. With its meditative yet bluesy atmosphere, it blends Western musical traditions with Eastern philosophical themes. Acoustic guitar, slide guitar, and harmonica create a rich soundscape, while a Tibetan singing bowl adds a unique spiritual dimension. The lyrics explore themes of lifelong learning, spiritual awakening, and finding hope in later life.
