## Mañjuśrī’s Proclamation  
  
*(Verse 1)* Listen, all ye gathered here, the Thus Come One's grand design, Mañjuśrī spoke with wisdom clear, "Today the truth will shine. With drums of wisdom sounding, banners raised on high, Torches lit, the knowledge spreads, like stars across the sky."

*(Chorus)* Oh, the light of truth is near, it spans the heavens wide, A ray of wisdom shining, no place for fear to hide. In the glow of Buddha's grace, the Dharma soon will flow, From the heart of the Thus Come One, the seeds of truth will grow.  
*(Chorus)* Oh, the light of truth is near, it spans the heavens wide, A ray of wisdom shining, no place for fear to hide. In the glow of Buddha's grace, the Dharma soon will flow, From the heart of the Thus Come One, the seeds of truth will grow.  
  
*(Verse 2)* In ancient days, the tales were told, of Buddhas shining bright, The Illuminator of Moon and Sun’s name, a beacon in the night. He taught the noble Fourfold Truth, the Perfections one by one, Guiding souls from suffering, ‘til their journey was done.

*(Bridge)* Eight sons with virtues shining, renounced the world’s embrace, Followed their father’s footsteps, on the enlightened path they’d trace. In the quiet of the night, the flowers fell like rain, As the Buddha’s light illuminated, the truth within our pain.

*(Verse 3)* Mañjuśrī stood before the crowd, recalling days of old, When Buddhas spoke and wisdom flowed, like silver turned to gold. "Today," he said, "we’ll see it clear, the Lotus Law unfold, A teaching deep as time itself, a truth so brave and bold."

*(Outro)* So let the light within us rise, and guide us on our way, As Buddha’s words take flight tonight, in the dawning of the day. With open hearts, we’ll hear the truth, the Lotus bloom will show, In the garden of the Dharma, where the seeds of wisdom grow.
