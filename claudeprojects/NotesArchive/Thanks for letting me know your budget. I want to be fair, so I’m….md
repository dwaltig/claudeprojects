Thanks for letting me know your budget. I want to be fair, so I’m open to the $170 **if there’s a clear breakdown** of what that includes—especially how the extra $50 would be earned based on our current goals.  
  
Right now, we’re focused on **YouTube (both channels), Facebook, and Instagram** with an emphasis on:  
	•	Promoting **existing releases**  
	•	Growing **organic engagement**  
	•	Supporting **scheduled content**  
	•	Staying transparent with performance and updates  
  
Can you send me a quick outline of what tasks you’ll handle weekly for each platform, and how that supports the $170 rate?  
  
Let’s try to meet in the middle. If you can show campaign activity and consistent effort on Facebook, Instagram, and both YouTube channels for April and May, we can revisit this for June.  
  
I want to support you, but I also need to be sure the work aligns with results. Let’s keep moving forward and build trust on both sides.  
  
Thanks again,  
**William**
