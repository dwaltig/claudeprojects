Tell me a riddle, I challenge you to read a little syndrome chapter a day to begin is difficult to know to keep again. It’s not easy to continue will be difficult. Some chapters are in an hour or more. Some are less than 10 minutes, but the rewards I’m coming I’m finishing a whole sutra within a month rewarding, you don’t have to understand that Buddha teaches us. Don’t take everything for granted don’t take everything on faith, but again we have to take things to begin to learn, and settle our doubts.
