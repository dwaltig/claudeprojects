Hello dear friends and fellow seekers,  
  
Welcome to our vibrant and compassionate community, dedicated to exploring and embracing the profound teachings of the Lotus Sutra! We are delighted to have you join us on this incredible journey of spiritual growth and self-discovery.  
  
In this sacred space, we come together as a collective, united by our shared interest in the Lotus Sutra's wisdom. We aspire to support, inspire, and learn from one another as we delve into the rich tapestry of the Buddha's ultimate teachings.  
  
As we engage with the sutra, we aim to cultivate our minds, awaken our hearts, and nourish our souls through meaningful discussions, shared experiences, and moments of reflection. Our journey will encompass the study of the text, the recitation of its verses, and the practice of its transformative principles in our daily lives.  
  
Together, let us embark on this spiritual odyssey with open hearts and inquisitive minds. May the Lotus Sutra's timeless wisdom illuminate our paths and guide us toward greater understanding, compassion, and inner peace.  
  
We look forward to sharing in this profound exploration with each of you, as we uphold the sutra and support one another on the path to enlightenment.  
  
With warmth and loving-kindness,  
William Altig
