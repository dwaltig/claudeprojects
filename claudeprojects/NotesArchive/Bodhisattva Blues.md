# Bodhisattva Blues  
*(A blues folk ballad in 4/4 time, gravel-road grit and grace)  *  
  
Verse 1    
Well, I heard a cry from Avīci’s night—    
Coal-black sorrow, no end in sight.    
But Dharma bones don’t break, they bend,    
‘Cause hell’s just a wound that ain’t learned to mend.    
  
Chorus    
Oh, I’m sharpening my ears, Lord, to the whole world’s hum,    
From the Highest Heaven down to the gutter’s drum.    
Ain’t runnin’ from the rain, no, I’m standin’ in the storm—    
The more I listen, the more I’m born.    
  
Verse 2    
Met a man hungry, a child gone cold,    
Heard the earth weep where the wars took hold.    
But awakening’s in the dirt, friend, the Lotus in the thorns—    
You gotta love this world ‘til your heart’s thread-worn.    
  
Chorus    
Oh, I’m sharpening my ears, Lord, to the whole world’s hum,    
From the Highest Heaven down to the gutter’s drum.    
Ain’t hidin’ from the pain, no, I’m dancin’ in the fray—    
The darker the night, the brighter the Way.    
  
Bridge    
Sumeru ain’t a mountain—it’s the dust in your hand,    
The crack in the coffee cup, the scar where you stand.    
So let the blues be your teacher, let the folk-song rise—    
Grace ain’t up yonder, it’s the look in your eyes.    
  
Verse 3    
Now I walk with the lost, sing with the blind,    
‘Cause these boots leave no soul behind.    
The road’s long, but the load’s made light—    
When you carry the world, you learn to hold it right.    
  
Outro    
(Harmonica wail, fading…)    
Oh, the practice is the path, and the path is the prayer—    
Keep listenin’, lovin’, breathin’ the air…    
Keep listenin’, lovin’, breathin’ the air…
