I understand the urgency of the situation with the dialysis equipment, and the importance of your role in ensuring everything runs smoothly. Please don’t feel any pressure about our meet-up. Your dedication to your work is one of the many qualities I admire about you. We can definitely reschedule to a time that's more convenient for both of us.

I look forward to possibly discussing faith and our individual journeys when we meet, Yaz. I'm hopeful that our upcoming meeting will be as enriching and positive as we envision. In the meantime, take care and stay in touch. Warmest wishes to your mother on her 89th birthday, and a copy of my book awaits you for our next rendezvous.
