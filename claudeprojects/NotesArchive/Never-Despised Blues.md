[Verse 1]  
They call me never-despised, but still they throw their stones,  
A humble man with open hands, but they beat me all alone.  
I bow down low, I bless your soul, though you don’t understand,  
I see a light inside your heart, a buddha in the sand.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, I’m the one they always scorn,  
A voice that sings through hate and thorn,  
But I keep on, I keep my stride—  
I’m the never-despised, the never-despised.  
  
[Verse 2]  
They say I’m just a foolish monk, no scripture in my hand,  
But I’ve got a vision deeper than the laws of this land.  
I tell ‘em, “You’re gonna rise, become more than you know,”  
But anger blinds their weary eyes, and the cruel winds blow.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, I’m the one they always scorn,  
A voice that sings through hate and thorn,  
But I keep on, I keep my stride—  
I’m the never-despised, the never-despised.  
  
[Bridge]  
Tiles and stones, sticks and spite, they try to break my soul,  
But my spirit’s rooted deep like a river’s rolling flow.  
I shout with patience, loud and clear, “You’ll walk the bodhisattva’s way,”  
Through all the pain and darkest nights, I never turn away.  
  
[Verse 3]  
This age is crooked, hearts are cold, the Dharma’s hard to find,  
But I keep on my sacred path, with love that’s blind and kind.  
Though karma’s road is long and slow, and their suffering is deep,  
One day we’ll meet beneath the tree, where Buddha’s light will keep.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, I’m the one they always scorn,  
A voice that sings through hate and thorn,  
But I keep on, I keep my stride—  
I’m the never-despised, the never-despised.  
  
[Outro]  
Yeah, through the fire and the rain, I still call your name,  
You’re a buddha yet to be, in this blues that bears no shame.
