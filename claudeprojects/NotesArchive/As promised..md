What Are the Awakening Factors?   
This course is designed around the natural momentum of this sequence of seven wholesome mental factors. As we strengthen one factor, we may find that next in the series arises naturally.   
  
Mindfulness   
  
It's mindfulness that sets the sequence of awakening factors in motion. Additionally, the other awakening factors can all be seen as dimensions of mindfulness. So mindfulness is pivotal. We turn towards our experience and begin to deepen in acceptance and understanding. We stop rushing outside of ourselves with craving and reactivity and allow body, heart, and mind into awareness more fully. When this happens the awakening factors can come forward as natural, wise responses.   
  
Investigation   
  
When mindfulness is present we feel settled in the midst of experience. We become naturally curious. We notice what mind states are present and their results, we see the outcomes of our actions and habits. This is the awakening factor of investigation arising and it leads us to greater wisdom, freedom, and energy.   
  
Energy   
  
Through an interest in the mind and phenomena we start to feel energized. This can show up as a feeling of lightness in the body or mind. It can be persistence and effort, dedication. It can also refer to an increased willingness to be with our experience mindfully. Meditation can put us in touch with some beautiful and some very challenging experiences. This quality of persistence keeps us going even when the level of energy in the body and mind feels low.   
  
Joy   
  
It is through willingness to be with experience that we become appreciative, and so more sensitive to joy. We become grateful for moments in which there is no particular difficulty present. We find a deep-seated wonder that does not depend on outward conditions. We taste life wholeheartedly, and through this the mind, heart, and body feel refreshed and resourced.  
   
Tranquility   
  
The experience of joy has a settling effect on the mind and heart. We experience deep stillness even in the midst of a busy day. We relax the tendency to lean forward into the future or backwards into the past. We rest in the moment. Aware. At ease. This sense of quiet appreciation allows the heart to settle even more.   
  
Unification   
  
Calmed and soothed through abiding in tranquility, the mind begins to unify. Those parts of us that have been scattered by the sensory world, by busyness and distress, come back into coalescence. We begin to feel whole again, and to heal. Our intentionality and steadiness of mind returns. The mind becomes pliant and wieldy: well-suited to inquiry. We feel gathered and collected. A mind that's unified in this way is a gateway to liberating insight, to wisdom.   
  
Equanimity   
  
It's said that peace is the highest happiness. The fruit of wisdom, of liberating insight, is equanimity. And this is often understood to be the goal of the Buddhist path – nibbana itself. Life, by its nature, is uncertain and unreliable. But as our practice of the awakening factors gathers momentum we develop a deep understanding of ourselves and of change, and out of this understanding flowers equanimity. We cease clinging. The fires within cool. There is peace at last.   
   
What does Buddhism mean by "Enlightenment"?   
   
By Matthieu Ricard on December 07, 2010   
Enlightenment is a state of perfect knowledge or wisdom, combined with infinite compassion. Knowledge in this case does not mean merely the accumulation of data or a description of the world of phenomena down to the finest details. Enlightenment is an understanding of both the relative mode of existence (the way in which things appear to us) and the ultimate mode of existence (the true nature of these same appearances). This includes our own minds as well as the external world. Such knowledge is the basic antidote to ignorance and suffering.    
But by ignorance we do not mean a simple lack of information. Rather we mean a distorted vision of reality that makes us think that what we see around us is permanent and solid, or that our ‟self” is a real, autonomous entity. This leads us to mistake fleeting pleasures or the alleviation of pain for lasting happiness. Such ignorance also makes us attempting to build our happiness on others' misery.   
We are drawn to what satisfies our ego and are repulsed by what might harm it. Thus, little by little, we create ever-greater mental delusion until we behave in a totally egocentric manner. Ignorance perpetuates itself and our inner peace is destroyed.    
Buddhism's form of knowledge is the final antidote to suffering. In this sense, it seems that knowing the brightness of stars or the distance between them may be very interesting in itself, but it cannot teach us how to become better people.   
Once, a man asked the Buddha some questions about cosmology. In reply, he picked up a handful of leaves and asked: ‟Are there more leaves in my hands, or in the forest?” ‟There are more in the forest, of course,” replied the man. The Buddha went on: ‟Well, the leaves in my hand represent the knowledge which leads to the end of suffering”. In this way, the Buddha showed that certain questions are superfluous. The world has limitless fields of study, as numerous as the leaves of the forest. But if what we want more than anything else is Enlightenment, then it is better to concentrate entirely on that aim and gather together only the knowledge that is directly relevant to our quest.
