Okay, here are some examples. This is a faded beard, which is short on the sides and longer on the chin. This is a box beard, which is squared off and neatly trimmed. This is a slicked-back hairstyle, which is combed straight back and can be styled with gel or pomade. This is a side part, which is parted on one side and can be styled with a comb or brush. Do any of these match the look you're going for?
