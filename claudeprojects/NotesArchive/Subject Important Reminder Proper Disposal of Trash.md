  
Subject: Important Reminder: Proper Disposal of Trash  
  
Dear Briarpoint Condominium Residents,  
  
I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to kindly remind everyone of our community's policy regarding the disposal of trash. It has been observed that on occasion, trash bags are being left outside of our doors, sometimes even overnight.  
  
We understand that everyone has busy schedules, but it is important to remember that leaving trash outside can lead to several issues. It not only detracts from the beauty and cleanliness of our shared spaces but also poses health and safety risks, including attracting pests.  
  
As per our community rules, all trash must be disposed of directly into the dumpsters provided. Please ensure that trash is not left outside your door or in the common areas at any time. For your convenience, the dumpsters are located at both ends of the Northern fence
