Lyrics:  
(Verse 1)   
Gather 'round, brothers and sisters, let your spirits soar   
Hear the word, the call to joy, knocking at your door   
The law of love, the path to peace, a message pure and true   
It's time to seek enlightenment, a brighter day for you  
  
(Chorus)   
Oh, Lord, preach the law, let your wisdom flow   
Bring your light into our hearts, help our spirits grow   
Release us from the chains of doubt, fear, and despair   
Show us the way, the truth, the life, beyond compare  
  
(Verse 2)   
Like the prince, we humbly ask, with open hearts and minds   
To receive the gift of wisdom, the solace that it finds   
Release all creatures, great and small, from suffering's embrace   
Let your compassion shine on all, with boundless love and grace  
  
(Chorus)   
Oh, Lord, preach the law, let your wisdom flow   
Bring your light into our hearts, help our spirits grow   
Release us from the chains of doubt, fear, and despair   
Show us the way, the truth, the life, beyond compare  
  
(Bridge)   
Move on the wheel, the sublime and exalted goal   
Set our souls on fire, make our spirits whole   
Guide us toward enlightenment, where darkness turns to light   
With faith as our compass, we'll walk the path that's right  
  
(Chorus)   
Oh, Lord, preach the law, let your wisdom flow   
Bring your light into our hearts, help our spirits grow   
Release us from the chains of doubt, fear, and despair   
Show us the way, the truth, the life, beyond compare  
  
(Outro)   
Let the law of love resound, in every heart and soul   
A symphony of joy and peace, make us complete and whole.
