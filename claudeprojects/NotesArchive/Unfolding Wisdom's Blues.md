# Unfolding Wisdom's Blues  
  
(Harmonica intro - slow, contemplative, with a slight mournful bend)  
  
(Verse 1)   
Woke up this mornin', sun a-burnin' gold   
Opened the Lotus Sutra, a story ages old   
Some folks say it's too deep, too hard to understand   
Like a hidden treasure, buried deep within the land   
Oh, they say it'll bring confusion, darkness to your mind   
That ain't the Buddha's purpose, no, that's not the path you'll find  
  
(Verse 2)   
Nichiren said, "Don't just chant it, study it too, my friend"   
For higher knowledge, wisdom's light, it has no end   
You gotta read the words, every line and every phrase   
Comprehend its meaning, through all your weary days   
Like a lonely lantern, on a mountain peak so high   
Its light cuts through the darkness, when the shadows multiply  
  
(Verse 3)   
It's a journey of exploration, open heart and discerning mind   
Not just for scholars, for all of humankind   
Just one single verse, if you grasp its truth so deep   
Immeasurable merit, from the seeds that you do keep   
A living seed within you, waiting to take root   
Blossoms into wisdom, a life-transforming fruit.  
  
(Verse 4)   
When distorted views rise up, tryin' to lead folks astray   
Your understanding blazes, banishing the darkened way   
You got to rely on scripture, not on tales that float around   
For truth is in the Dharma, firmly on the Buddha's ground   
Yeah, that's how you discern the worth, of all the teachings known   
And help prevent the errors that through the land are sown.  
  
(Verse 5)   
Now, the Buddha said, "Spread this truth with care and grace"   
To share this wisdom, in every time and place   
Be an envoy of the Thus Come One, with every word you speak   
For even one single phrase, strong Bodhisattvas seek   
It's a guiding light for travelers, a boat across the sea   
Propagatin' the Law, for all humanity.  
  
(Verse 6)   
Encourage another, just to hear it for a spell   
The merit is immense, more than words can tell   
You’ll gain wisdom and keen faculties, a mind both clear and bright   
Helpin' others toward enlightenment, with all your sacred might   
From keeping, reading, comprehending, teaching it far and wide   
The Lotus Sutra's blessings, no longer can they hide.  
  
(Outro)   
So keep on studyin' the Sutra, let its wisdom fill your soul   
Comprehend its meaning, makin' your spirit whole   
Discern the correct teachings, and spread the truth so true   
That's the path to deeper faith, for me and for you.   
  
(Harmonica fades out, slowly and peacefully)
