**Subject: Introduction of Our New Property Manager – Lynn Marticiuc & In-Person Meeting**  
  
**Dear HOA Board Members,**  
  
**I hope you’re all doing well.**  
  
**I’d like to introduce Lynn Marticiuc as our new property manager from Creative Management. With 20 years of experience, including 13 years with Creative, she brings a wealth of knowledge that will benefit our community.**  
  
**On Monday, we had initially planned to meet virtually as a board, but given the circumstances, it would be more prudent to meet in person. To facilitate this, we will be gathering at Denny’s on Westheimer for our introduction and board discussion. This will allow us to meet Lynn face-to-face and ensure a smooth transition.**  
  
**Looking forward to seeing you all there. Please let me know if you have any questions.**  
  
**Best,**  
**William Altig**
