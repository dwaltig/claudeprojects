**Protections of the Lotus Sutra**  
  
Beneath the gilded canopy of Dharma’s eternal light, The Lotus blooms in steadfast grace, dispelling darkest night. A shield against all worldly harm, its petals softly close, Guarding hearts from storms that rage, and every thorn that grows.  
  
When earthquakes rumble deep below or tempests tear the sky, Its teachings weave a sacred veil where tranquil spirits lie. A refuge found in faith's embrace, where sickness fears to tread, And pathways bloom with healing steps where once despair had spread.  
  
No shadowed whisper dares intrude where Sutra’s light is cast, No demon's clutch nor vile intent can bind or hold us fast. The Buddha’s voice resounds within, dispelling fear and doubt, A steadfast guide to liberation’s all-encompassing route.  
  
Yet these protections come with toil, not gifts by idle hand, For faith demands a steady heart, like roots within the sand. Through practice, vows, and ceaseless care, the Sutra’s strength reveals A power forged in dedication, tempered by the wheel.  
  
Oh, radiant Lotus, bloom of truth, you gather all who seek, The weary, lost, and broken souls, the humble and the meek. Through your embrace, they find the path, a boundless stream of grace, And rise like suns to light the worlds, transcending time and space.  
  
So may we walk this sacred road, with courage as our guide, Protected by the Sutra’s song, with wisdom by our side. For every step is marked by joy, each breath, a pure delight, Beneath the gilded canopy of Dharma’s endless light.
