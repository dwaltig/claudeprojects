# That Spark	  
  
[intro]  
  
Verse 1:  
In every heart   
a Buddha lies,  
A spark of light   
that never dies,  
From darkest night   
to brightest day,  
We all can find   
the Buddha way.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, the Lotus blooms,   
(The Lotus blooms)  
For one and all,   
(For one and all)  
In the silence, listen close,   
You'll hear that call.   
(You'll hear that call)  
From mountain high to deep blue sea,   
(Mount to sea)  
Buddha's wisdom sets us free.   
(Sets us free)  
  
Verse 2:  
With skillful means,   
the teacher shows,  
A path   
that only each one knows,  
From many roads,   
we walk as one,  
Till all our journeys   
are undone.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, the Lotus blooms,   
(The Lotus blooms)  
For one and all,   
(For one and all)  
In the silence, listen close,   
You'll hear that call.   
(You'll hear that call)  
From mountain high to deep blue sea,   
(Mount to sea)  
(Mount to sea)  
(Mount to sea)  
Buddha's wisdom sets us free.   
(Sets us free)  
  
Verse 3:  
An eternal Buddha,   
timeless, true,  
Guides us in all we say   
and do,  
Through the veil   
of life’s disguise,  
A deeper truth   
before our eyes.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, the Lotus blooms,   
(The Lotus blooms)  
For one and all,   
(For one and all)  
In the silence, listen close,   
You'll hear that call.   
(You'll hear that call)  
From mountain high to deep blue sea,   
(Mount to sea)  
Buddha's wisdom sets us free.   
(Sets us free)  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
Bridge:  
In faith and love,   
we find our way,  
With bodhisattvas,   
we will stay,  
In every soul,   
a song is sung,  
The path to peace   
for everyone.  
  
Verse 4:  
Non-duality   
we find,  
The unity of heart   
and mind,  
In the web of life,   
we see,  
A cosmic dance   
of harmony.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, the Lotus blooms,   
(The Lotus blooms)  
For one and all,   
(For one and all)  
In the silence, listen close,   
You'll hear that call.   
(You'll hear that call)  
From mountain high to deep blue sea,   
(Mount to sea)  
Buddha's wisdom sets us free.   
(Sets us free)  
  
Outro:  
Present moment,   
here and now,  
We make a humble,   
sacred vow,  
To live in truth,   
with hearts so pure,  
In the Lotus,   
we are sure.  
  
[Instrumental]
