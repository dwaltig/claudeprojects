*(Verse 1)* The Teacher's gone silent, he's left our **sight**,   
But a fire he kindled still burns so **bright**.   
In shadows he whispered, a promise **clear**,   
Hold tight to faith, leave behind all **fear**.   
Chapter twenty-one carved it plain and **true**,   
**His radiant light, shining through me and you.**  
  
*(Chorus)* Oh, the Lotus Sūtra, mystical and free, Wisdom rollin' down, like a mighty sea. Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, sing it clear and proud, Guaranteed enlightenment, shout it loud.  
  
*(Verse 2)* He showed us the signs, with power divine, Tongue touched the heavens, lit up the sky. A cough and a snap shook the ground below, Signs of assurance, for hearts that truly know. Write it, speak it, feel every word’s grace, Merit like sunlight, assuring your place. Dispelling darkness, lifting the veil, The Saha transformed, it cannot fail.  
  
*(Chorus)* Oh, the Lotus Sūtra, mystical and free, Wisdom rollin' down, like a mighty sea. Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, sing it clear and proud, Guaranteed enlightenment, shout it loud.  
  
*(Verse 3)* From depths of the earth, they rise again, Teachers of truth, fearless women and men. Superior Practice, calling your name, Carryin' the seed through darkness and flame. Boundless compassion, courage so wide, Wisdom awakening, no place to hide. Earth-born leader, rising above, Guiding all hearts with wisdom and love.  
  
*(Chorus)* Oh, the Lotus Sūtra, mystical and free, Wisdom rollin' down, like a mighty sea. Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, sing it clear and proud, Guaranteed enlightenment, shout it loud.  
  
*(Bridge)* This path isn't chosen just for a few, Buddha-nature blooms inside of you. One vehicle calling, all roads lead home, Together we rise, never alone. Polish the mirror, clear out the dust, Let chanting fill you with courage and trust. Old curses broken, peace now released, Through Lotus's power, all suffering ceased.  
  
*(Final Chorus)* Oh, the Lotus Sūtra, mystical and free, Wisdom rollin' down, like a mighty sea. Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, sing it clear and proud, Guaranteed enlightenment, shout it loud.  
  
*(Outro)* The Buddha's promise won't fade away, Keep faith alive, chant every day. Enlightenment's here, it’s guaranteed, Through the Lotus Sūtra, your soul is freed.
