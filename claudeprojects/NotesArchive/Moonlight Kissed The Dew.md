[Intro]  
(Verse 1)    
Lost in the woods, can't find my way,    
Shadows so heavy, night won't turn to day.    
The trees, they whisper, the wind, it moans,    
I'm just a wanderer, scared and alone.    
  
(Chorus)    
Oh, but the moonlight kissed the dew,    
Showed me beauty I never knew.    
In the darkest night, a spark broke through,    
Gave me hope, gave me strength to start anew.    
  
(Verse 2)    
Feet are tired, my soul feels cold,    
Fear in my heart, it's takin' its toll.    
But then I see it, a tiny glow,    
A leaf shimmering, the moonlight's show.    
  
(Chorus)    
Oh, the moonlight kissed the dew,    
Showed me beauty I never knew.    
In the darkest night, a spark broke through,    
Gave me hope, gave me strength to start anew.    
  
(Bridge)    
Life’s a forest, wild and deep,    
Lose your way, it’s hard to keep.    
But even when the night seems cruel,    
There’s light to guide, and a golden rule.    
  
(Verse 3)    
Found my path, I’m movin’ ahead,    
No more fear, no more dread.    
That glow on the leaf lit my soul on fire,    
Now I’m walkin’ strong, I’m climbin’ higher.    
  
(Chorus)    
Oh, the moonlight kissed the dew,    
Showed me beauty I never knew.    
In the darkest night, a spark broke through,    
Gave me hope, gave me strength to start anew.    
  
(Outro)    
So if you’re lost, don’t you despair,    
Light is waiting, it’s always there.    
Just look for the glow, the shimmer, the hue,    
And let the moonlight kiss the dew.
