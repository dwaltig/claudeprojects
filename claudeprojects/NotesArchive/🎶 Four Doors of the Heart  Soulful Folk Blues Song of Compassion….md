**Lyrics:**  
  
[Verse 1]  
I felt the cold wind rising,  
Sharp words and empty eyes.  
I turned away from kindness,  
Built walls to hide the lies.  
  
But even stone will whisper,  
When the frozen starts to thaw.  
Cruelty and silence faded,  
Pointed back to love’s true law.  
  
[Chorus]  
Four doors of the heart, waiting to be known,  
Compassion and kindness, joy softly shown.  
When shadows crumble and bitterness parts,  
Step through the silence — open your heart.  
  
[Verse 2]  
I envied all their laughter,  
Judged faces passing by.  
Misery and anger whispered,  
Told me love was just a lie.  
  
But sorrow asked the question,  
That broke me from the spell.  
“What beauty are you missing?  
What story could you tell?”  
  
[Chorus]  
Four doors of the heart, waiting to be known,  
Compassion and kindness, joy softly shown.  
When shadows crumble and bitterness parts,  
Step through the silence — open your heart.  
  
[Bridge]  
No soul too lost, no night too deep,  
Even the fiercest anger weeps.  
When eyes look up and tears depart,  
The gentle light will fill your heart.  
  
[Final Chorus]  
Four doors of the heart, wide open tonight,  
Mercy and wonder, clear-seeing light.  
The world will bloom as we take part,  
In love that sings in every heart.
