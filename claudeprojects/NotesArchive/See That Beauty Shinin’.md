# See That Beauty Shinin’  
  
Embark on a soulful journey from the everyday "mud" of the Saha world to the illuminating discovery of "Basic Goodness" shining brightly within and all around. This song, blending heartfelt reflection with spiritual insight, explores the profound transformation that occurs when we shift our perspective. It's a reminder that, like the lotus flower, purity and wisdom can emerge even from troubled grounds, and the inherent truth—our "Arousing-nature"—is always present, waiting to turn suffering into a "sweet and blessed surprise." Tune in and let your eyes open to the beauty that never dies.

Lyrics:   
(Verse 1)   
Woke up this mornin' in the Saha world, feels like mud outside my door. Yeah, woke up this mornin' in the Saha world, feels like mud outside my door. Got these troubles weighin' on my mind, Lord, can't take this sufferin' no more.  
  
(Verse 2)   
But they say there's a jewel hid deep inside, though I can't find the key. Yeah, they say there's a jewel hid deep inside, waitin' just for me. That Arousing-nature, Lord, it's wild and free.  
  
(Chorus)   
But when I see that beauty shinin', opens up my weary eyes, This whole world starts transformin', a sweet and blessed surprise. Deep in that light I see it, the truth that never dies, The **Goodness** shinin' through, Lord, right before my very eyes.  
  
(Verse 3)   
See that lotus flower breakin' from the muddy ground. Yeah, see that lotus flower breakin' from the muddy ground. Provin' purity can rise, even when trouble's all around.  
  
(Verse 4)   
They talk 'bout purifyin' this old dusty land. Yeah, talk 'bout transformin' it with a gentle hand. Turnin' suffering to the Enlightened realm, understand...?  
  
(Chorus)   
But when I see that beauty shinin', opens up my weary eyes, This whole world starts transformin', a sweet and blessed surprise. Deep in that light I see it, the truth that never dies, The **Goodness** shinin' through, Lord, right before my very eyes.  
  
(Verse 5)   
It ain't the place outside, it's the mind that changes the view.... Yeah, gotta see with the mind, gotta see the inherent truth. 'Cause wherever I see beauty, I see the **Goodness**, shine on through....  
  
(Outro)   
See the **Goodness's** joy shinin' through... In the jeweled trees so high, in the pure water pond. See the **Goodness** shinin' through, from now on and beyond. Yeah... see the **Goodness**… everywhere I look around.
