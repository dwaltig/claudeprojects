# Twigs and Leaves  
  
A stark, bluesy folk ballad that tells a heavy story.  
  
Inspired by the dramatic schism in Chapter Two of the Lotus Sūtra, "Twigs and Leaves" is a song about one of the most subtle dangers on the spiritual path: arrogance (māna). It recounts the moment when 5,000 practitioners, believing they had already achieved enlightenment, walked away from the Buddha's ultimate teaching. They mistook a milestone for the final destination.  
  
This is a song about the Buddha's silent, powerful reaction—watching the "twigs and leaves" depart from the assembly, purifying it for the final truth. It's a mournful warning about the price of certainty and a call for the deep endurance (Kṣānti) required to stay the course.  
  
Told with just a voice and an acoustic guitar, it's an intimate, raw, and hypnotic story for anyone who has ever wrestled with questions of faith, progress, and humility.

### Genre: Bluesy Folk Ballad)  
### (Intro) (Slow, mournful acoustic guitar...)  
### (Spoken, in rhythm):  
### Here's a song 'bout a crowd...  
### Who thought they were done,  
### 'Fore the final truth had even come.  
###   
### (Verse 1: The Revelation)  
### The Master rose up from his deep samādhi rest  
### Said, "My skillful means were just a temporary test."  
### "Those three small roads you traveled, the vehicles you knew,  
### "Were just a clever shelter, 'til I revealed the truth to you.  
### "There's only one Great Vehicle, one single road to ride,  
### "The journey is the goal now... there's no final place to hide."  
###   
### (Verse 2: The Five Thousand Depart)  
### Five thousand souls stood up, and they started to go.  
### They bowed their heads politely, but their feet were movin' slow.  
### They had that sickness of the soul, that spiritual pride (māna),  
### Attached to what they'd reached, but with nothin' left inside.  
### Convinced they'd gained the final Law, while the job was incomplete,  
### They thought they'd attained... what they'd never reached... and stumbled on their own feet.  
###   
### (Chorus: The Buddha’s Silence)  
### Oh, the Arrogance Trap, it's a lock on the deepest door,  
### It's thinkin' that you're done, when He's askin' you for more.  
### The Buddha watched them leave... He didn't argue or coerce.  
### He said, "The assembly's purified, it's free from somethin' worse."  
### He said the "twigs and leaves" are gone, just the truthful souls remain.  
### That self-imposed exile... the price of all their spiritual pain.  
###   
### (Verse 3: The Price of Certainty)  
### They built a life on certainty that couldn't stand the shock,  
### Mistook a restin' milestone for the true top of the rock.  
### So tragically faithful to their own constricted view,  
### They judged the Master by the little road they knew.  
### Their pride was just a high, high wall, built from their own good works,  
### That old, deluded arrogance... where the deepest shadow lurks.  
###   
### (Bridge: The New Armor)  
### To the faithful ones who stayed, the Master gave the key.  
### He told Maitreya, "Listen... here's what you're gonna see...  
### "You gotta wear the armor of Endurance, deep and true,  
### "You gotta practice patience when the insults come for you.  
### "From those same arrogant people... who think they've found the way...  
### "You must remain unswayed, don't you listen to what they say."  
###   
### (Outro)  
### The slander that they throw... that's just fuel for wakin' up.  
### The aggressor is your teacher, fillin' up your merit cup.  
### The Buddha gave his final lesson in the silence of that room...  
### Just watchin' the twigs and leaves fall... and walkin' to their doom.  
###   
### (Guitar fades out slow)
