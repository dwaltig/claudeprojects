**Lyrics: **  
  
**I**  
How long will darkness hold its grip on me, And veil the path that once I could foresee? How long will echoes be my only guide, As I wander lost with none beside?  
**II**  
Deep within, I search for light's embrace, Yet sorrow lingers, leaving not a trace. How long will fears and doubts entwine, While foes rejoice in victories that aren't mine?  
**III**  
O gentle whisper in the silent night, Illuminate my soul with newfound sight. Lest I succumb to shadows' cold decree, And fade away, a distant memory.  
**IV**  
Let not the trials define my name, Nor adversaries revel in my shame. Grant me the strength to rise anew, To walk the path that's tried and true.  
**V**  
In mercy's arms, I place my trust, From ashes rise, as all things must. My heart awakens to hope's refrain, A melody that soothes all pain.  
**VI**  
I sing the song of life's enduring grace, For love that spans both time and space. Transformed by journeys through the night, I step into the dawn's embracing light.
