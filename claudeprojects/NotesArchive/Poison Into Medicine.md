## Poison Into Medicine   
**Verse 1:**   
Well, I woke up this morning, trouble at my door Same old heavy burden that I've been carrying before But the teacher said to me, "Don't you turn and run— The lotus blooms in muddy water, rising to the sun"  
  
**Chorus:**   
Gonna turn this poison into medicine Let the struggle make me strong again Every trial is a teacher, every tear's a friend Gonna turn this poison into medicine  
  
**Verse 2:**   
Lightning in the darkness shows you where to go Can't appreciate the mountain if you never climb the road The fire that tests you is the fire that makes you shine Your earthly troubles are the path to the divine  
  
**Chorus:**   
Gonna turn this poison into medicine Let the struggle make me strong again Every trial is a teacher, every tear's a friend Gonna turn this poison into medicine  
  
**Bridge:**   
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, that's the ancient song Finding joy right in the middle when everything goes wrong The seed breaks open in the dark beneath the ground Before the flower shows its face, it's got to be broken down  
  
**Verse 3:**   
So bring your storms and bring your rain, bring your heaviest load I'll be chanting through the pain, walking down this road 'Cause suffering ain't the enemy I used to know It's the gateway to the wisdom that will help me grow  
  
**Final Chorus:**   
I'm turning poison into medicine Let the struggle make me strong again Every trial is a teacher, every tear's a friend I'm turning poison into medicine Oh, I'm turning poison into medicine  
  
**Outro:**   
(Slow and resolute)   
Delight is in the struggle, friend Delight is in the struggle, friend The lotus rises, and will rise again
