[Verse]  
I climbed the mountain high and wide  
Found the truth right by my side  
In the shadow of the doubters  
Wisdom's echo always louder  
  
[Verse 2]  
Through the lessons carved in stone  
Found a path all my own  
With the trials  
I stood tall  
Learned the rise before the fall  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh Devadatta  
Teacher of mine  
In your wisdom  
Bright I shine  
Saved the world with open eyes  
In shadows  
Truth will rise  
  
[Verse 3]  
Taught me how to fight the night  
Every wound a source of light  
With your doubts  
I found belief  
In the pain  
I found relief  
  
[Verse 4]  
Lived a life so brave and wild  
In each heart lies a child  
With each tear and with each scar  
I've become just who we are  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh Devadatta  
Teacher of mine  
In your wisdom  
Bright I shine  
Saved the world with open eyes  
In shadows  
Truth will rise
