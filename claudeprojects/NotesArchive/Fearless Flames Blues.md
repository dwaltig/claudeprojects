Lyrics:   
(Verse 1)    
When the road is dark, and the winds howl cold,    
I hear a call, a story told.    
A truth so deep, it breaks the chain,    
Lifts the heart, and soothes the pain.    
We’ll walk this path, no matter the fight,    
Fearless hearts shining through the night.    
  
(Chorus)    
Fearless, we’re standing tall,    
When the shadows rise, we won’t fall.    
Truth is burning, a guiding flame,    
We’ll speak the word, we’ll sing the name.    
  
(Verse 2)    
They can shout, they can jeer, throw stones at our way,    
But the light inside never fades away.    
With every step, the world’s pain we face,    
But love and wisdom leave no trace of hate.    
Through storms and fire, our voices ring,    
Carrying the song that the ancients sing.    
  
(Chorus)    
Fearless, we’re standing tall,    
When the shadows rise, we won’t fall.    
Truth is burning, a guiding flame,    
We’ll speak the word, we’ll sing the name.    
  
(Bridge)    
This world can be cruel, but we’ll rise above,    
With open hands and a heart of love.    
The truth we carry ain’t bound by creed,    
It’s a light for the lost, it’s the hope we need.    
  
(Verse 3)    
In the face of doubt, we find our voice,    
To walk this path is a sacred choice.    
We’ll share the light, no matter the cost,    
For every soul found, there’s no one lost.    
So bring your hate, your slander, your fear,    
We’ll turn it to love, and draw you near.    
  
(Chorus)    
Fearless, we’re standing tall,    
When the shadows rise, we won’t fall.    
Truth is burning, a guiding flame,    
We’ll speak the word, we’ll sing the name.    
  
(Outro)    
Fearless we’ll walk, till the last day comes,    
Singing this song under moon and sun.    
Through every trial, through joy and pain,    
We’ll sing for the world, and we’ll rise again.

The forest floor is lush with vibrant green ferns and moss. Gentle mist weaves through the trees, and the scene is illuminated by a warm, golden sunrise. In the background, snow-capped peaks such as Mount Hood or Mount Rainier rise majestically, partially shrouded in soft clouds. The atmosphere is serene, natural, and uplifting, with rich, photorealistic detail and the nostalgic quality of Nikon film photography. The imagery conveys perseverance and enlightenment, with the rising sun symbolizing the fearless spirit that overcomes the night.
