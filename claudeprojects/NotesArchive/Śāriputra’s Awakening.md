[Lyrics:]  
  
[Verse 1]  
In caves and woods, I wandered lost  
Pondering the teachings, feeling tossed    
Bodhisattvas praised, my heart would ache  
Had I missed the path I longed to take?  
  
[Chorus]  
But then the Buddha's wisdom shone  
Dispelling doubts, my fears all gone    
The wondrous law, profound and true  
Awakening in me, a vision new  
  
[Verse 2]   
No more shall Mara's lies deceive  
The Buddha's truth, I now perceive    
A destiny so grand unfolds  
A future as a Buddha foretold  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[Reprise Verse 2]   
No more shall Mara's lies deceive  
The Buddha's truth, I now perceive    
A destiny so grand unfolds  
A future as a Buddha foretold  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[Bridge]  
In distant kalpas, I shall rise  
Padmaprabha, Radiant Lotus wise  
In Viraga, a land so pure    
Where Dharma's light will long endure  
  
[Verse 3]  
Bodhisattvas gather, jewels abound  
In Buddha's wisdom, truth is found  
Though counterfeit may someday reign    
The relics cherished will remain  
  
[Reprise Verse 3]  
Bodhisattvas gather, jewels abound  
In Buddha's wisdom, truth is found  
Though counterfeit may someday reign    
The relics cherished will remain  
  
[Chorus]  
The Buddha's word has set me free  
A joyous fate, my eyes now see  
Through eons long, the light extends    
Until all beings reach their journey's end  
  
[Outro]  
Oh Śāriputra, faithful son    
Your quest for truth has just begun  
In Buddha's grace, your soul shall sing  
Enlightenment, your gift to bring
