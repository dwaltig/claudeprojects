# Be There  
  
A bluesy folk ballad riding a modern trap heartbeat, *Be There* celebrates the quiet heroism of simply showing up. Built on finger-picked guitar, warm harmonies, and a deep 808 groove, the song tells two stories—moments when a friend’s compassion pulled us through, and times when we returned that grace to someone else.  
  
It’s a personal reflection and a call to action: the greatest kindness isn’t always loud or grand. Sometimes it’s a steady hand on a shoulder, a late-night cup of coffee, or just staying present while the storm passes.  
  
Let this track remind you: **the small acts—being there, really there—can change a life.**  
  
Lyrics:   
**Be There**  
  
Intro (trap beat enters, low 808 thump + brushed snare)  
A hush before the sunrise,  
Streetlights hum in gray,  
A simple knock at the doorway,  
Said more than words could say.  
  
⸻  
  
Verse 1  
Guitar strings walk a dusty blues,  
Kick drum rolls like heartbeats true.  
I was lost in a storm I couldn’t name,  
Bills stacked high, the voices blamed.  
Then you came by with coffee and time,  
No sermon, no plan—just a quiet sign.  
  
⸻  
  
Chorus (big lift, layered harmonies & hi-hat triplets)  
Be there—sometimes that’s everything.  
A hand on the shoulder, the bell that rings.  
Not every hero wears a crown or cape,  
Sometimes love is the pause you take.  
Be there, oh be there—  
That’s the kindness that sets us free.  
  
⸻  
  
Verse 2  
Remember that night by the neon store,  
You found me shaking, couldn’t breathe no more.  
You stayed ‘til the silence found its tune,  
Lit my dark with a sliver of moon.  
Now I keep watch when others fall,  
Answer their call like you answered mine.  
  
⸻  
  
Bridge (trap drop—808 slides + sparse guitar riff)  
No lecture, no grand design,  
Just a steady rhythm of hearts aligned.  
A moment small, the world can’t see,  
But it rewrote the map inside of me.  
  
⸻  
  
Final Chorus (add gospel-style backing vocals)  
Be there—sometimes that’s everything.  
A hand on the shoulder, the bell that rings.  
Not every hero wears a crown or cape,  
Sometimes love is the pause you take.  
Be there, oh be there—  
That’s the kindness that sets us free.  
  
⸻  
  
Outro (fade with guitar + soft hi-hat shimmer)  
So when the night is heavy and long,  
Remember that friendship is a song.  
One quiet act, one open door—  
That’s the beat the world is aching for.
