# "Inexpressible Light (The Song of the Bodhisattva Path)" *(inspired by Chapter 8 of the Lotus Sutra)*  
  
**"Inexpressible Light (The Song of the Bodhisattva Path)"** is a tender and meditative folk-blues ballad inspired by Chapter 8 of the *Lotus Sutra*.   
Through the quiet reverence of Pūrṇa Maitrayanīputra and the profound silence surrounding the Buddha’s immeasurable virtues, the song explores the tension between language and truth. While words fall short, they also serve as gentle guides — skillful means that help beings awaken to their own Buddha-nature.   
With imagery drawn from the rain nourishing all plants, the compassionate vow of the Bodhisattva, and the luminous interconnection of life, this song invites listeners on a deeply personal and universal journey. Performed in an intimate acoustic style, with soft guitar, optional harmonica, and heartfelt vocals, *Inexpressible Light* offers a space for reflection, connection, and the aspiration to walk the path of selfless compassion and wisdom.   
A song for seekers and sages alike.

**[Verse 1]** Pūrṇa rose with gentle grace, Eyes upon the Buddha's face. Words fell short — no tongue could weave, The boundless gifts we can't conceive.  
The World-Honored One, beyond compare, Radiates wisdom through the air. Yet speech and thought, they falter fast, Before a truth too deep, too vast.  
  
**[Refrain]** *O wondrous light, beyond all name,* *Yet words must rise, like gentle rain.* *To guide us home, they point, they call,* *Though language fails — they serve us all.*  
  
**[Verse 2]** Language breaks and notions bend, Still, kind words lead to journey’s end. Skillful means, the teacher’s art, Parables that stir the heart.  
The rain falls soft on every leaf, Each takes what cures its silent grief. So varied paths, yet all unite, In One Vehicle's boundless light.  
  
**[Refrain]** *O wondrous light, beyond all name,* *Yet words must rise, like gentle rain.* *To guide us home, they point, they call,* *Though language fails — they serve us all.*  
  
**[Bridge] (softer, contemplative)** Old habits cling, the self holds tight, Craving shadows veil the sight. But emptiness is not despair, It's interbeing everywhere.  
With mindful breath and open hand, The Bodhisattva takes a stand. For all the world, they vow to be, A lamp for those who cannot see.  
  
**[Verse 3] (uplifted)** Pure compassion leads the way, Transforming night into endless day. Though Buddha's merit can't be told, It lives in hearts both young and old.  
So rise with joy, and walk the shore, The Sutra sings forevermore. Where all are kin, and none apart, The Bodhisattva's vow will start.  
  
**[Final Refrain] (gentle and resolved)** *O wondrous light, beyond all name,* *Yet words must rise, like gentle rain.* *To guide us home, they point, they call,* *Though language fails — they serve us all.*
