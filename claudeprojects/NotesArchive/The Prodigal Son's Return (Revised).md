# The Prodigal Son's Return (Revised)  
  
"The Prodigal Son's Return" is a soulful blues-folk journey that reimagines an ancient parable for modern ears. This track blends Delta blues grit with contemporary folk introspection, weaving a tale of loss, recognition, and spiritual homecoming.  
  
Starting with melancholic fingerpicking that echoes the protagonist's wandering years, the song evolves through call-and-response choruses that bridge earthly struggles with divine patience. As slide guitar and harmonica intertwine, the narrative unfolds, culminating in a revelatory bridge and an uplifting final chorus that celebrates the universal journey from alienation to belonging.  
  
With lyrics rich in allegory and a sound that pays homage to both Robert Johnson and Bob Dylan, "The Prodigal Son's Return" offers a unique fusion of Western musical traditions and Eastern philosophical insights. It's a meditation on the nature of identity, the power of unconditional love, and the often-winding path to self-realization.

Verse 1:  
Fled from father's fortune,   
Fled from father's fortune,   
young and wild and wrong   
Fifty summers simmered,   
Fifty summers simmered,   
sorrow was my song   
Poverty my partner,   
Poverty my partner,   
shame my only friend   
Wanderin' and wonderin'   
Wanderin' and wonderin'   
when my woes would end   
  
Chorus:   
Oh Lord, oh Lord   
How blind these eyes have been   
To riches 'round me, to the love within   
Fear kept me far   
But faith has brought me near  
Father's patient passion   
Year after year  
Year after year  
  
Verse 2:  
Mansion's master saw me,   
Mansion's master saw me,   
standing at his gate   
Knew me as his kin,   
Knew me as his kin,   
yet knew he had to wait   
Menial my labor,   
Menial my labor,   
mighty his design   
Slowly, surely shiftin' from my will to thine   
Slowly, surely shiftin' from my will to thine   
Slowly, surely shiftin' from my will to thine   
Slowly, surely shiftin' from my will to thine   
Slowly, surely shiftin' from my will to thine

Verse 3:  
Mine the meager dwelling,   
Mine the meager dwelling,   
his the manor grand   
Two decades of toil   
Two decades of toil   
by my calloused hand   
"Son," he softly called me,   
"Son," he softly called me,   
son I couldn't be   
Stuck in servant's station,   
Stuck in servant's station,   
blind to destiny    
blind to destiny    
blind to destiny    
blind to destiny    
blind to destiny

Bridge:  
Then dawned the day of truth   
Then dawned the day of truth   
long-concealed   
Legacy revealed,   
Legacy revealed,   
love's plan unsealed   
"No more a hireling,   
"No more a hireling,   
but heir to all," he said   
"My heart has held you,   
"My heart has held you,   
from the day you fled"   
  
Final Chorus:  
Oh Lord, oh Lord,   
Oh Lord, oh Lord,   
now clear these eyes can see   
The wealth of wisdom,   
The wealth of wisdom,   
waiting there for me   
Prodigal no longer,   
Prodigal no longer,   
I've come home at last   
Buddha's boundless children,   
Buddha's boundless children,   
from a bygone past   
from a bygone past
