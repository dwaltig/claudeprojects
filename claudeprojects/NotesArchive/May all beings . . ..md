serve a countless number of buddhas and fully carry out an immeasurable number of buddhas’ ways and doctrines. May we exert  ourselves bravely and vigorously, and may our names be universally known. May we realize the Law that is profound and never known before, and preach it in accordance with what is appropriate.  
  
May we fully posses both expedient means and the paramita of wisdom.  
  
May we have immeasurable compassion, unlimited eloquence, power, fearlessness, concentration, emancipation, and samadhis. May we deeply enter the boundless and awaken to the Law never before attained.  
  
May All Beings know how to make various distinctions and to expound the teachings skillfully. May our words be soft and gentle and delight the hearts of the assembly.  
  
May we fully realize the Law that is limitless, boundless, never attained before.
