# In the Heart of the Lotus	  
  
[Verse 1]  
In a sacred text, a truth's unfoldin',  
Enlightenment for all, no one's beholden.  
Stories, parables, in the imagery light,  
Teachin' deep wisdom, in the still of night.  
  
[Chorus]  
One true path, though many seem to be,  
A single road for you and me.  
Diverse the ways, they come in sight,  
But all converge in wisdom's light.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Supreme it stands, in Mahayana’s lore,  
The Lotus Sutra, we can't ignore.  
In every heart, it plants a seed,  
To enlightenment, it leads indeed.  
  
[Chorus]  
One true path, though many seem to be,  
A single road for you and me.  
Diverse the ways, they come in sight,  
But all converge in wisdom's light.  
  
[Bridge]  
Through tales and visions, it shows the way,  
Guidin' us to the light of day.  
No one left out, no one left behind,  
In the Lotus Sutra, truth we find.  
  
[Chorus]  
One true path, though many seem to be,  
A single road for you and me.  
Diverse the ways, they come in sight,  
But all converge in wisdom's light.  
  
[Outro]  
So walk the path, with heart so true,  
The Lotus Sutra, guiding you.  
To enlightenment, we all can go,  
In unity, our spirits flow.
