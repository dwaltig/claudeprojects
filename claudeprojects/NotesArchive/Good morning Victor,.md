Good morning Victor,  
  
I genuinely need your guidance and leadership in this critical endeavor. Our board is at a crossroads, with voices of uncertainty echoing through the halls. Denise and Simon have expressed reservations about certain directions, and while I’m hopeful that we’re overlooking a greater potential, I’m left wondering how we can move forward when silence prevails.  
  
Denise has hesitated to take on key tasks, particularly in ensuring that Lawrence doesn’t shoulder all our responsibilities. I reassured her that the workload can be shared, but we still haven’t finalized important details, such as writing a clear and inspiring job description for the porter position. We have exciting projects on the horizon, but without decisive action, they remain mere ideas. I’ve reached out to Denise for her insights, but unfortunately, I haven’t received a response yet.  
  
To provide context, Lawrence is our neighbor who built an incredible and cost-effective fence for our property. His concrete expertise is precisely what we need now, especially considering the urgent need to rebuild more fences after the July hurricane and renovate our parking lot with new concrete. Lawrence has offered bids for these projects, but the board has chosen to remain silent. Meanwhile, Lawrence has also been considered as a potential porter, and Denise has assigned him projects without promising payment. He believes that taking on this work could lead to more contracts. Given our current board split of 4 to 2 in favor, it’s evident that we urgently need a fifth member to guide us forward.  
  
I firmly believe that you, with your unique vision and leadership, could help us pivot into action. I’m asking you to reconsider rejoining the board and collaborating with our neighbors to harness their diverse talents and strengthen our community. We’re all facing similar challenges, and I’m convinced that with a few bold steps, we can transform these obstacles into opportunities.  
  
I hope you hear my call. Let’s challenge the status quo, question what we accept as inevitable, and forge a future where our community thrives through collaboration and shared purpose.  
  
I’d like to explore how we can bridge the gaps and leverage the strengths within our community.  
  
Warm regards,  
William
