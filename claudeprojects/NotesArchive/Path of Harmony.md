Lyrics:   
  
**(Intro)** Yo, it’s the rhythm of truth, the beat of the soul, Dharma’s the compass, it’s making us whole. Align with the flow, let the cosmos inspire, Ignite that spark, set the spirit on fire.  
  
**(Verse 1)** Dharma’s the order, the righteous call, The cosmic beat that connects us all. It’s the duty we carry, the path we tread, The voice of wisdom in the words unsaid. From the stars above to the earth we stand, It’s the law of life, the eternal plan. When we walk in truth, let compassion reign, We break the cycle, transcend the pain.  
  
**(Hook)** Feel the flow, let the Dharma guide, Ride the waves of the cosmic tide. Righteous living, let your soul ignite, In the dance of the universe, we find the light.  
  
**(Verse 2)** Potential’s in you, don’t let it hide, Buddha-nature’s shining deep inside. Every step, every breath you take, The Dharma’s there, like the dawn’s first break. It’s the harmony of what’s right and real, The truth you live, the love you feel. In the Lotus Sutra, the One Vehicle rides, All beings together, where wisdom abides.  
  
**(Bridge)** Listen to the whispers of the cosmic scheme, Life’s a river flowing to a greater dream. Dharma’s the key, the door, the way, Unlock the truth, let the shadows fade.  
  
**(Hook)** Feel the flow, let the Dharma guide, Ride the waves of the cosmic tide. Righteous living, let your soul ignite, In the dance of the universe, we find the light.  
  
**(Outro)** So step to the mic, let your spirit sing, With the Dharma’s truth, we rise as kings. Align with the rhythm, let your heart take flight, In the song of the cosmos, we shine so bright.
