This inquiry aims to explore the philosophical and symbolic resonances between the *I Ching* and the *Lotus Sutra*, particularly through the lenses of **transformation, interdependence, and skillful means**. While rooted in distinct traditions—Confucian-Daoist cosmology and Mahāyāna Buddhism—they share profound insights into the nature of reality, ethical action, and the unfolding of wisdom.

	2.	**Can specific hexagrams correspond symbolically with particular chapters or parables from the Lotus Sutra?**

This is not a syncretic blending for its own sake, but an effort to understand how ancient wisdom systems can **inter-reflect**, inform each other, and support modern spiritual and ethical practice.
