Lyrics:   
(Verse 1)  
In a village green and fair,  
Thomas farmed with love and care.  
Malachi, his neighbor proud,  
Laughed at faith, and spoke aloud:  
  
(Chorus)  
"Karma's dance is just a tale,  
No god watches, no scales prevail.  
I'll reap the riches, take my share,  
Dharma's path, I'll never bear."  
  
(Verse 2)  
Storm clouds gathered, winds did roar,  
Testing all, from shore to shore.  
Thomas's fields stood strong and true,  
Malachi's crops, in ruin grew.  
  
(Chorus)  
Karma's dance, a lesson learned,  
Actions reaped, as fate has turned.  
Thomas's faith, a guiding light,  
Malachi's pride, lost in the night.  
  
(Verse 3)  
Little Lily, caught in the fray,  
Thomas rescued, come what may.  
Dharma's call, he bravely heard,  
Compassion's song, in each deed stirred.  
  
(Chorus)  
Karma's balance, sharp and keen,  
Dharma's path, forever green.  
Choose your way, with heart and mind,  
In every act, your fate entwined.  
  
(Bridge)  
The wise old sage, on the mountain high,  
Saw the storm pass, with knowing eye.  
"Karma and dharma, hand in hand,  
Guide us all, across the land."  
  
(Outro)  
So let us heed, this ancient lore,  
Live with love, forevermore.  
In every choice, a seed we sow,  
Karma's dance, forever flows.
