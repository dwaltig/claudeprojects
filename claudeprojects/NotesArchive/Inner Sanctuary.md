Lyrics:  
(Verse 1)   
In a city's bustling heart,   
Ethan sought a worldly part.   
Climbing ladders, chasing dreams,   
Lost in fortune's fleeting gleams.  
  
(Chorus)   
But an old book, worn and wise,   
Opened Ethan's weary eyes.   
"Inner Sanctuary," it said,   
"Peace within, where souls are fed."  
  
(Verse 2)   
He'd neglected kin and friend,   
Spirit starved, nearing its end.   
But the book's words, soft and true,   
Planted seeds, a life anew.  
  
(Chorus)   
Inner Sanctuary, calm and bright,   
Guiding Ethan towards the light.   
Honesty, compassion's embrace,   
Building a sacred, inner space.  
  
(Verse 3)   
He turned from gold's alluring shine,   
To nurture bonds, the true divine.   
Prayer and stillness filled his days,   
Gratitude, a heartfelt praise.  
  
(Chorus)   
Inner Sanctuary, strong and deep,   
Where peace and joy forever sleep.   
Ethan's heart, once lost and cold,   
Now overflowing, stories told.  
  
(Bridge)   
Colleagues watched with wondering eyes,   
As Ethan's spirit learned to rise.   
Success still came, but now he knew,   
True riches lie in virtues true.  
  
(Chorus)   
Inner Sanctuary, a guiding star,   
Leading all who've wandered far.   
In a world of restless gain,   
Find your peace, let love remain.  
  
(Outro)   
So let Ethan's tale inspire,   
To build within, a sacred fire.   
For the greatest wealth we find,   
Is a peaceful heart, a joyful mind.
