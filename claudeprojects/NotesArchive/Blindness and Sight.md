# Blindness and Sight  
  
[Intro]  
[Verse 1]  
Like a man born without sight,  
Who claims there’s no day, no night.  
No sun, no moon, no starlight,  
For he’s known only endless night.  
  
[Verse 2]  
But a doctor, kind and wise,  
Brings the man a great surprise.  
From the mountain, he supplies,  
Four herbs to heal his eyes.  
  
[Chorus]  
With these herbs, the man can see,  
From his blindness, he is free.  
“I was wrong, I now agree,  
The world is more than I decree.”  
  
[Verse 3]  
So too, are the beings blind,  
In the whirl of life confined.  
Till the Enlightened One, kind,  
Opens the eye of the mind.  
  
[Verse 4]  
A disciple finds a pearl,  
His mind unfurls, in a whirl.  
“I’ve reached Nirvana,” he’ll twirl,  
Not knowing, it’s more than one swirl.  
  
[Chorus]  
With these herbs, the man can see,  
From his blindness, he is free.  
“I was wrong, I now agree,  
The world is more than I decree.”

[reprise-Verse 4]  
[reprise-Verse 4]  
A disciple finds a pearl,  
His mind unfurls, in a whirl.  
“I’ve reached Nirvana,” he’ll twirl,  
Not knowing, it’s more than one swirl.  
  
[Bridge]  
In the stillness, truth is found,  
Beyond the noise, beyond the sound.  
Seek within, and you will find,  
The hidden path, the enlightened mind.  
  
[Verse 5]  
But the Sage, seeing his pride,  
Says, “There’s more outside your stride.  
From your room, the world is wide,  
Your knowledge, it’s time to guide.”  
  
[Verse 6  
“If omniscience is your quest,  
Seek wisdom, put your mind to test.  
In the wilderness, you’ll be blessed,  
With transcendent faculties, no jest.”  
  
[Chorus]  
With these herbs, the man can see,  
From his blindness, he is free.  
“I was wrong, I now agree,  
The world is more than I decree.”  
  
[Verse 7]  
See the world as but a dream,  
A phantom river’s silent stream.  
Unborn, undying, it may seem,  
An echo in the cosmic scheme.  
  
[Verse 8]  
He who knows that all is void,  
Each law, each truth, each paranoid.  
Each moment lived, each moment enjoyed,  
Sees Nirvana, the truth deployed.  
  
[Chorus]  
With these herbs, the man can see,  
From his blindness, he is free.  
“I was wrong, I now agree,  
The world is more than I decree.”  
The world is more than I decree.”
