# The Buddha's Disappearance  
  
"The Buddha's Disappearance" is a contemplative hip-hop track that reimagines ancient Buddhist wisdom for the modern era. Drawing directly from Chapter 16 of the Lotus Sutra, the lyrics explore the paradoxical teaching that sometimes a spiritual guide must disappear for their message to be truly received. The track cleverly frames Buddha's strategic absence as an act of compassion rather than abandonment, using the parable of the wise physician to illustrate how we often value what seems lost more than what's constantly available.  
  
Through three verses connected by a powerful hook, the song progresses from recognizing suffering, to understanding the teacher's strategy, to discovering the Buddha nature within oneself. The production balances meditative elements with contemporary beats, creating space for reflection while maintaining an engaging rhythm. The bridge serves as a moment of revelation, while the outro delivers the ultimate insight: the Buddha we seek externally is ultimately found within.  
  
Perfect for mindful listening, spiritual contemplation, or as an introduction to Buddhist philosophy through an accessible modern medium.

Verse 1  
I see you sinking, struggling, drowning in the deep   
Caught in suffering's ocean, can't get no sleep   
I offered you medicine, you pushed it away   
"Not now, not this, maybe some other day"   
So I gotta disappear, that's my strategic move   
Sometimes absence is the only thing that proves   
The value of what's always been right in your face   
Creating that void so you finally embrace  
  
Hook  
When I'm gone, that's when you notice me (Notice me)   
When I'm gone, that's when you finally see (Finally see)   
When I'm gone, that's when you start to reach (Start to reach)   
The medicine was always there, just out of reach  
  
Verse 2  
Your house is burning but you're playing with the flame   
Poison in your system, you don't know who to blame   
I'm like that wise physician with the remedy in hand   
Playing dead so my children finally understand   
It ain't about my ego or getting your respect   
It's about waking you up to what you neglect   
Sometimes the teacher's gotta exit the stage   
For the student to turn to the unread page  
  
Hook  
When I'm gone, that's when you notice me (Notice me)   
When I'm gone, that's when you finally see (Finally see)   
When I'm gone, that's when you start to reach (Start to reach)   
The medicine was always there, just out of reach  
  
Bridge  
I never really left though (No)   
I'm eternally present (Yes)   
The Buddha nature flowing   
Through your veins like a current   
You think I disappeared (Nah)   
But I've been here all along (Right here)   
When you stopped taking me for granted   
That's when my signal got strong  
  
Verse 3  
You gotta lose me to find me, that's the paradox   
When I'm out of sight, that's when your mind unlocks   
The Lotus teaching hidden in plain view   
The path was always there, waiting on you   
I'm in the silence between your thoughts   
In the space where attachment gets caught   
I'm in the breath that you finally notice   
When suffering gets real and you lose your focus

The medicine was always there, just out of reach  
  
Outro  
So thank me for leaving, thank me for the space   
'Cause now you're seeking, looking for my face   
And in that seeking, you'll find what was true:   
The Buddha you're looking for—that Buddha is you
