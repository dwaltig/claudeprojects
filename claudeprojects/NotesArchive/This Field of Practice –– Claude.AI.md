# This Field of Practice –– Claude.AI  
  
In the marketplace of countless souls,  
Where merchants call and commerce rolls,  
Ancient wisdom flows like springs,  
Through mundane acts and common things.  
Each storefront holds a dharma gate,  
Each transaction seals our fate.  
  
Not in peaks where clouds unfold,  
Nor temples wrought in distant gold,  
But here, amidst the coins that ring,  
Where children laugh and merchants sing,  
Truth blooms like lotus from the mud,  
*Where all is understood.*  
  
In scriptures shared at break of day,  
In counsel given, debts to pay,  
The Dharma threads through every trade,  
Through every promise that is made.  
Each bargain struck with honest heart  
Marks where the sacred path may start.  
  
To earn rice, to guide the way,  
To share what helps all beings stay,  
Each gesture, made with mindful care,  
Becomes an offering, becomes a prayer.  
The marketplace transforms to shrine,  
Where earthly meets the divine.  
  
Oh, see your life in morning light,  
Where shadows flee and doubt takes flight,  
For in this clarity you find  
The boundless field of humankind.  
Each shop becomes a sacred space,  
Each face shines with timeless grace.  
  
No need to seek on distant shore,  
The truth lies at your very door,  
In every step on dusty street,  
In every stranger that you meet.  
The path unfolds beneath your feet,  
Where earth and heaven daily meet.  
  
So take this world of gain and loss,  
Of dust and dreams and golden dross,  
And see within its shifting ways  
The light that fills our fleeting days.  
For in this field of common things,  
The heart finds wings, the spirit sings.
