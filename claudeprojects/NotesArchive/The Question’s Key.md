# The Question’s Key  
  
(Verse 1)  
The ground it shook, the earth it groaned, a **vision** grand and new.   
From 'neath the **Sahā** world, **Bodhisattvas** rose into view.   
A million faces, wise and old, a mystery to behold.   
**Then** Maitreya, standing brave, his honest question told:   
'Buddha, where do these folks come from, we've never seen them here before?   
Your forty years, a fleeting glance, what's hidden at your core?'  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, the question is the key, unlocks the truth within.   
Not blind belief, but eyes to see, where wisdom can begin.   
Let faith be tempered, strong and bright, by what your heart can find.   
Experience and inquiry, illuminating mind.  
  
(Verse 2)  
They say the Buddha once taught, on wisdom's open road:   
'Don't take it just on scripture's word, or stories ages old.   
No rumor, logic, **what teachers say**, or tradition's heavy hand.   
But test it, prove it, day by day, across this suffering land.   
Does it bring harm, or inner peace?   
Does greed and hatred cease?   
That's how you know the truth is true, that's how you find release.'  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, the question is the key, unlocks the truth within.   
Not blind belief, but eyes to see, where wisdom can begin.   
Let faith be tempered, strong and bright, by what your heart can find.   
Experience and inquiry, illuminating mind.  
  
(Verse 3)  
The Buddha smiled, a gentle nod, 'Excellent, excellent, friend!'   
Your 'very important' question asked, till journey's deepest end.   
For faith, it's no mere sleepy trust, it's active, pure, and deep.   
It seeks the light, it stirs the dust, the promises to keep.   
**For** wisdom and faith, they walk as one, no wisdom cold and bare.   
No faith that floats beneath the sun, without a thoughtful prayer.  
  
(Bridge)  
He spoke of ages, far, far back, a lifespan known to none.   
His 'ancient disciples' now on track, beneath the rising sun.   
The 'Skilled Physician' parable, **a deeper truth disguised**.   
An **upāya** to stir the soul, to open up your eyes.   
To be an island to yourself, with Dharma as your guide.   
No other refuge, no one else, no place for truth to hide.  
  
Chorus)  
Oh, the question is the key, unlocks the truth within.   
Not blind belief, but eyes to see, where wisdom can begin.   
Let faith be tempered, strong and bright, by what your heart can find.   
Experience and inquiry, illuminating mind.  
  
(Outro)  
So keep on asking, seek the way, let doubts become your light.   
For truth unveils itself each day, in the clear and fading night.   
Yeah, in the clear and fading night...
