# The Wanderer and the Hound  
In a land of sun-scorched dunes and restless winds, there roamed a wanderer named Torin. He was a man of fierce spirit, proud of his untamed heart. Beside him loped a hound, lean and swift, its eyes glinting with a hunger no leash could fully tame. Torin loved the beast dearly, claiming its wildness as his own. “We choose our path,” he’d say, “and no one will bind us.”  
One evening, as shadows stretched across the sand, Torin came upon an old weaver by a flickering fire. Her loom hummed with threads that shimmered like promises, and beside her sat a clay jar etched with faint runes. She glanced at the hound, then at Torin, and beckoned him near.  
“Rest a moment, wanderer,” she said. “The desert tests even the wildest souls.”  
Torin squared his shoulders. “I need no rest, and my hound answers to me alone.”  
The weaver smiled, her fingers never pausing. “I’ve a tale for you, if you’ll hear it. No chains, just words.”  
The hound growled low, but Torin sat, drawn by curiosity—his choice, he told himself.  
“Once,” she began, “there was a Storm, free and fierce, tearing through the dunes. It uprooted tents, scattered flocks, and roared its liberty. The people pleaded for calm, but the Storm sneered, ‘I bow to no one.’ A trickster watched, knowing force would fail. So he climbed a dune and played a horn—a wild, soaring note that matched the Storm’s own howl. The Storm paused, hooked by the sound. ‘Play on,’ it demanded. The trickster grinned. ‘Only if you sweep gentler through the villages.’ The Storm chose to carry the tune, still free, but weaving purpose into its gusts.”  
Torin scratched the hound’s ears, unconvinced. “The trickster tricked it. That’s not freedom.”  
“Was it?” the weaver asked. “The Storm chose, every step. The trickster just showed a path it hadn’t seen.” She tapped the jar. “Here’s a gift, freely given. Inside’s a muzzle of woven reed—light, but strong. It’ll quiet your hound’s teeth for three days, enough to cross the ridge to an oasis where cats roam safe. Take it or leave it. Your will’s your own.”  
Torin’s jaw tightened. He’d bragged once, months back, that if his hound ever harmed the desert’s creatures, he’d cage it or send it away. Now, two cats lay dead by its jaws, and the weaver’s words stung. The hound had slipped free on a long leash, chasing its nature while Torin lingered, deaf to the screams till too late. He could refuse the muzzle, keep roaming as he pleased. But the ridge loomed, and whispers of a council’s judgment echoed on the wind—harsher than a reed muzzle.  
“You’re cornering me,” he snapped. “Blaming me for what’s mine.”  
The weaver shook her head. “I’m just spinning threads, old friend. You told me once you’d do right by your hound if it came to this. I’m offering a way—yours to take or not.”  
Torin glared at the jar, then at the hound panting at his side. He loved its wild heart, but its hunger had carved a hell he couldn’t escape. The weaver was no stranger—she’d walked dunes with him before, shared water and laughter. Now she sat as judge and friend, her gift a mirror he didn’t want. He could snatch the muzzle, leash his hound tighter, and claim the choice. Or he could walk on, daring the council to chain them both.  
He stood, kicking sand into the fire. “You’ve made this my prison,” he growled, and stormed off, hound at his heels. The weaver watched him go, her loom humming still. The wind carried her tune after him, faint but persistent, as the dunes shifted under his feet.  
  
**I saw us in this story. I’m not trying to cage you, just hoping we can find a way through together.**
