[Refrain]  
*Oh, the strength of kindness builds my home,*  
*Forbearance clothes me, I’m not alone.*  
*In peaceful arms, I find the light,*  
*Truth and love gonna guide my fight.*  
  
[Verse 1]  
Dreadful times are comin’, I can see,  
Men so wicked, bound by greed.  
Mockin’ truth, but we’ll stand tall,  
Spread this Sūtra to one and all.  
  
[Refrain]  
*Oh, the strength of kindness builds my home,*  
*Forbearance clothes me, I’m not alone.*  
*In peaceful arms, I find the light,*  
*Truth and love gonna guide my fight.*  
  
[Verse 2]  
They’ll come with lies, they’ll tear us down,  
Twistin’ words to spread their sound.  
But the girdle of patience keeps me whole,  
For the Chief of the world, I’ll give my soul.  
  
[Bridge] *(Instrumental—harmonica or guitar solo)*  
*(Let the melody echo the feeling of endurance and hope)*  
  
[Verse 3]  
Evil monks with hearts so cold,  
Preach for profit, chasin’ gold.  
But we’ll endure, through stick and stone,  
Our hearts in truth, we’re never alone.  
  
[Refrain]  
*Oh, the strength of kindness builds my home,*  
*Forbearance clothes me, I’m not alone.*  
*In peaceful arms, I find the light,*  
*Truth and love gonna guide my fight.*  
  
[Verse 4]  
Body or life, we won’t defend,  
The Sūtra’s flame, we’ll never bend.  
Through towns and lands, we’ll spread His name,  
Proclaim the truth, and light the flame.  
  
[Refrain – Repeat Twice]  
*Oh, the strength of kindness builds my home,*  
*Forbearance clothes me, I’m not alone.*  
*In peaceful arms, I find the light,*  
*Truth and love gonna guide my fight.*  
  
[Outro – Slow Fade]  
*Guide my fight, oh, guide my fight,*  
*Truth and love, in the peaceful light…*  
  
Performance Notes:  
	1.	Melody: Keep the vocal melody simple and repetitive, letting the emotional weight of the lyrics shine. A soulful blues progression (e.g., Am, Dm, E7) works beautifully.  
	2.	Instrumentation: Acoustic guitar, slide guitar, or harmonica can add depth. A slow drumbeat with brushes and bass can emphasize the chant-like rhythm.  
	3.	Call and Response: Consider adding a choir or backup vocals to echo key phrases in the refrain, reinforcing the communal and meditative feeling.
