# The Unbowed Tree  
  
A mentor's charge, a lifelong quest,   
To find the sun within the breast,   
To teach the heart, in storms and strife,   
The revolution of a life.  
  
He spoke of clouds that haunt the mind,   
And the great, grounded tree we find—   
Whose patient roots drink from the deep,   
While winds of bitter trial sweep.  
  
He taught that from the deepest snow,   
The most magnificent sun can glow,   
And in the sutra's cosmic scroll,   
A victor's courage makes us whole.  
  
This is the art of winning peace,   
A dialogue that will not cease,   
To see in every soul a friend,   
And help a culture of peace ascend.  
  
For happiness is not a prize,   
But faith that looks through hopeful eyes—   
An unshakable and deep refrain,   
That builds a world exempt from pain.
