##   
1. Being condescending is an unintelligent way to make yourself feel superior.  
2. Your pompous attitude and condescending comments have convinced me that you are smart and very important. Said no one ever.  
3. Just cause you look down on everyone doesn’t mean they are looking up to you.  
4. Healthy, happy people don’t go around putting people down using negative criticisms and insults.  
5. You just show the world how truly insecure and unhappy you are in your own life.  
6. Yes, your condescending judgmental comment has completely convinced me to do what you want. Said no one ever!  
7. I love the new condescending head tilt .Are you trying out a new passive aggressive trick?  
8. Being smug and condescending doesn’t make you important. It makes you a jerk.  
9. I love when crazy people think they’ve had the last word and in reality, all you did was to let them continue to show off their pompous arrogance. You can’t fix stupid!  
10. Hold still while I strangle that condescending demon out of your throat.
