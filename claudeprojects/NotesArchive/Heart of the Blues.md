[Intro]  
(Verse 1)  
I walked this road thinkin' I was alone,  
Holdin' tight to all that felt like my own.  
But every step, I see clearer now,  
I'm just a wave in an endless flow somehow.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, emptiness, it don’t mean I’m gone,  
It’s the river we’re flowin’ on.  
No form, no feelin’, just you and me,  
Risin’ and fallin' like waves in the sea.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
(Verse 2)  
Each thought, each heartbeat, born and fades,  
Nothin' stands alone, we’re all intertwined this way.  
From causes and conditions, we come and go,  
In the heart of emptiness, I’ve come to know.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, emptiness, it’s the dance we’re in,  
Life turns 'round, and we begin again.  
No self to cling to, no need to hide,  
In this boundless heart, we’re all side by side.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
(Bridge)  
Gaté, gaté, paragaté, we move as one,  
Through shadows and light, ’til the journey’s done.  
We rise and fall like the wind and tide,  
In the dance of life, no need for pride.  
  
(Verse 3)  
So I lay down sorrow, let go of fear,  
In this world of emptiness, we’re all right here.  
Each face, each story, a spark, a flame,  
In this heart of silence, we’re all the same.  
  
(Chorus)  
Yeah, emptiness, where all things meet,  
In the hollow of space, life tastes so sweet.  
No walls, no boundaries, just you and me,  
Risin' and fallin', like waves in the sea.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
(Outro)  
Oh, emptiness, you set me free,  
A life beyond what I thought I’d be.  
Gaté, gaté, findin’ my way,  
In this heart of silence, I’ll stay.  
  
[End]
