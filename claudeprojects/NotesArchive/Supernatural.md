# Supernatural  
  
[Verse 1]  
Ancient wisdom's light is shining,  
Buddha's teachings, timeless, binding.  
What was hidden now unfolds,  
Compassion's mind, our future molds.  
  
[Chorus]  
Supernatural powers, yeah,  
Born from understanding, oh yeah.  
In our hearts, we seek and find,  
A world of wonder in our mind.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Every struggle holds a spark,  
Transforming shadows in the dark.  
With kindness strong and blues to heal,  
We rise up to the Buddha's deal.  
  
[Chorus]  
Supernatural powers, yeah,  
Born from understanding, oh yeah.  
In our hearts, we seek and find,  
A world of wonder in our mind.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[Bridge]  
Let the music be our guide,  
Walking tall with Dharma pride.  
In the blues and kindness too,  
We find the magic, me and you.  
  
[Chorus]  
Supernatural powers, yeah,  
Born from understanding, oh yeah.  
In our hearts, we seek and find,  
A world of wonder in our mind.  
  
[Outro]  
Hope and dreams, they surround us,  
Building homes where love abounds.  
Buddha's voice, it rings so true,  
In every note, the world's made new.
