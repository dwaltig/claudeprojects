**Verse 1:**  
**Verse 1:**  
Deep in the earth, where waters blur,  
A lotus seed begins to stir.  
In darkness bound, yet full of grace,  
It dreams of light, it seeks its place.  
  
**Chorus:**  
**Chorus:**  
Oh, rise up, through the mud and rain,  
Break free, from all the weight and pain.  
From the flood, where shadows breed,  
Blooms the flower of the lotus seed.  
  
**Verse 2:**  
**Verse 2:**  
Through murky depths, it fights the fear,  
Pushes through, year after year.  
In its heart, the way is clear,  
The sun will rise, the dawn is near.  
  
**Chorus:**  
**Chorus:**  
Oh, rise up, through the mud and rain,  
Break free, from all the weight and pain.  
From the flood, where shadows breed,  
Blooms the flower of the lotus seed.  
  
**Bridge:**  
**Bridge:**  
It cracks the shell that holds it tight,  
Reaching up toward the light.  
Through earth and flood, it’s freed at last,  
A story from the distant past.  
  
**Verse 3:**  
**Verse 3:**  
In stillness pure, it starts to bloom,  
A lotus born from earth’s dark womb.  
With roots held fast and petals wide,  
It tells of strength, with nothing to hide.  
  
**Chorus:**  
**Chorus:**  
Oh, rise up, through the mud and rain,  
Break free, from all the weight and pain.  
From the flood, where shadows breed,  
Blooms the flower of the lotus seed.  
  
**Outro:**  
**Outro:**  
So plant your seeds, though skies be gray,  
The lotus finds its own true way.  
In time, you’ll see, in waters low,  
From the mud, the purest grow.
