# Love Till Love's the Only Sure  
  
# SoundCloud/WordPress Description  
## Version 1 (Poetic)  
**Love Till Love's the Only Sure (The Infinite Medicine Blues)**  
A spiritual blues journey about the most powerful medicine—and why the world throws stones at those who offer it.  
Inspired by ancient Buddhist wisdom and rooted in the delta blues tradition, this song tells the story of a physician who brings an ultimate cure to a town that isn't ready to receive it. Through weathered vocals, crying harmonica, and gospel call-and-response, it explores the paradox at the heart of transformation: the greatest truths often face the fiercest resistance.  
When the medicine that heals looks like poison to those afraid to be healed, what does love do? It keeps offering. It keeps singing. It loves till love's the only sure thing left.  
*"Every curse word is a chance to be kind / Every rejection is a way to refine"*  
For anyone who's ever been misunderstood for telling the truth. For anyone who's carried medicine through a hostile world. For anyone learning that persecution and compassion are two faces of the same path.  
Raw. Ancient. True.  
  
## Version 2 (Direct/Accessible)  
**Love Till Love's the Only Sure (The Infinite Medicine Blues)**  
Why would people hate you for offering a cure?  
This slow-burning spiritual blues explores a timeless paradox: the most transformative teachings often provoke the strongest resistance. Inspired by the Lotus Sutra's prophecy of persecution and the delta blues tradition of singing truth through suffering, this song is both a warning and a medicine.  
Featuring raw, soulful vocals, National steel guitar, Hammond B3 organ, and gospel harmonies, "Love Till Love's the Only Sure" walks you through darkness into light—from stones thrown to birds taking flight.  
A parable. A prayer. A blues song about carrying impossible love through an impossible world.  
*65 BPM. D minor. Your heart, broken open.*  
  
## Version 3 (Story-driven)  
**Love Till Love's the Only Sure (The Infinite Medicine Blues)**  
An old physician rolls into town with medicine that promises to cure any illness forever. But there's a warning: "Many will hate this cure with jealousy."  
Why?  
This 14-minute spiritual blues odyssey answers that question through the marriage of Buddhist philosophy and American roots music. It's about three healers whose identities are threatened by ultimate truth. About stones that become doves. About love that doesn't quit even when the world wants it to.  
Recorded with the raw authenticity of field recordings—weathered vocals, fingerpicked steel guitar, wailing harmonica, churning Hammond organ, and a gospel choir testifying in the spaces between breaths.  
Part folk tale, part sermon, part meditation on why the medicine we most need is the hardest to swallow.  
This is music for the crossroads. For the vigil. For anyone who's ever loved what others couldn't yet endure.

Well the old physician rolled into town  
Said, “I got medicine, gonna pass it around.”  
“Ain’t no quick fix, no sugar-sweet lie,  
One drop of this truth and you’ll never die.”  
  
*(Pause, low growl)*  
“But I’ll warn you, child—it cuts both ways.  
This cure burns bright and it don’t obey.”  
  
**[Chorus - Call and Response]**   
[Gospel call-and-response, full band, Hammond organ swell, walking bass, background choir "tell me tell me" "Lord have mercy", kick on 1 and 3, communal questioning]  
  
Why they gonna hate you for the cure? (Tell me, tell me)  
Why they gonna hate you for the cure? (Lord, have mercy)  
‘Cause truth don’t fit the story they adore—  
That old story, Lord, they’re clingin’ for sure.  
  
**[Verse 2 - Building]**   
[Building narrative, harmonica answers vocal, tambourine offbeats, slight tempo push, steel guitar crying, organ returns on hope line]  
  
There were three healers in that town,  
One cooled fever, one calmed it down.  
Built their names on what they knew—  
Then came the stranger sayin’, “That ain’t true.”  
  
“Y’all been teachin’ folks to cope,” said he,  
“But hope’s the only remedy.”  
“The sickness ain’t what you believe—  
It’s the fear you won’t release.”  
  
**[Chorus]**   
Why they gonna hate you for the cure? (Tell me, tell me)  
Why they gonna hate you for the cure? (Lord, have mercy)  
‘Cause truth don’t fit the story they adore—  
That old story, Lord, they’re clingin’ for sure.  
  
**[Bridge - Speaking Blues Style]**   
*[Sparse acoustic guitar, nearly spoken vocal conversational, bass returns slowly, building intensity, organ swells rise, front-porch storytelling to preaching]*  
  
*Now listen here...*  
The headache woman, she turned pale,  
Thirty years of learning felt like fail.  
“If pain ain’t my mountain, what’s left of me?”  
She cried to the man by the healing tree.  
  
He said, “Sister, I ain’t here to win—  
I’m just showin’ you where health begins.”  
“That fear you feel’s the final wound,  
My medicine works there too—real soon.”  
  
**[Verse 3 - Intensity Rising]**   
[Full band restrained, kick drum harder, minor ii-V-i blues, wailing harmonica, dark organ pad, warning tone, building to explosion]  
  
He called the young ones, said, “Gather ‘round,  
This truth’ll cost you—dear and profound.”  
“When you carry this medicine through the town,  
Those old healers’ll try to strike you down.”  
  
“They’ll call you fool, they’ll call you liar,  
But love’s the flame that lights the fire.  
When the stones start flyin’—don’t you hide,  
That’s the moment faith’s been tried.”  
  
**[Big Chorus - Full Voice]**   
[Full gospel eruption, everyone testifying together, organ full chords, drums with sticks, tambourine constant, pedal steel screaming, huge cathedral reverb, tape saturation, peak intensity]  
  
Why they gonna hate you for the cure? (Tell me, tell me)  
Why they gonna hate you for the cure? (Lord, have mercy)  
‘Cause truth don’t fit the story they adore—  
That old story, Lord, they’re clingin’ for sure.  
  
**[Verse 4 - Softer, Mystical]**   
[Major key shift F major, mystical ethereal, pedal steel leads, finger cymbals, bowed bass legato, soft kick heartbeat, arpeggio guitar, angelic choir pad, long shimmer reverb]  
  
“You won’t be walkin’ all alone,  
Every healer’s ghost will see you home.  
Guardians fierce, soft as lullabies,  
Keep watch beneath the mercy skies.”  
  
*"They'll keep your heart soft when the world gets hard*   
*They'll stand watch while you're standing guard"*   
*"And that attacker throwing stones at your head?*   
*That's your teacher in disguise," the old man said*  
  
**[Verse 5 - The Teaching]**   
[Return D minor warmer, gentle teacher voice, harmonica in major first time, balanced natural mix, hope and wisdom, conviction building]  
  
*"See, every curse word is a chance to be kind*   
*Every rejection is a way to refine"*   
*"That headache healer with the angry face*   
*She carrying the medicine too, just ain't found the place"*  
  
*"Deep down inside where she's afraid to look*   
*That's where the healing is, that's the holy book"*   
*"And when she finally gets a pain won't quit*   
*She might remember you offered something different"*  
  
**[Final Chorus - Resolution, Hope]**   
[Medium intensity peaceful, harmony vocals blend not respond, major IV chord on daybreak, warm balanced, acceptance not triumph, breathes naturally]  
  
Let ‘em hate you for the cure—love ‘em anyway,  
Let ‘em hate you for the cure—sing while you pray.  
Love what they can’t endure till daybreak’s pure,  
Love till love’s the only sure.  
  
**[Instrumental—Just harmonica and steel guitar, 8 bars, No words, just the feeling of "rest" - the teaching is complete, Then drop into the quiet Outro]**  
  
**[Outro - Slow, Fading]**   
*[Whisper-sung fading, instruments drop one by one, pedal steel high sustains, backgrounds whisper echo, last phrase solo voice single guitar, spoken intimate ending, final D note rings 8 seconds natural decay]*  
  
*The old physician, he opened up his hand*   
*Put a drop of medicine on the child who'd stand*   
*Said "You been the healer all along, you see*   
*The cure was always you, and you was always free"*  
  
*So she walked through that town*   
*With her head held high*   
*Carrying that medicine*   
*Underneath a hostile sky*  
  
*And when they threw their stones* *(Threw their stones)*   
*She threw back love* *(Nothing but love)*  
*'Cause the medicine can't be killed* *(No sir, it can't)*   
*The truth can't be defeated* *(Already won)*   
*The light was always there* *(Always there)*   
*Just waiting to be seen*  
*Waiting to be seen, Lord*   
*Waiting to be seen*  
  
**[Final Note - Spoken]**  
*That's the infinite medicine blues*   
*And everybody singing it*   
*Even when they don't know the words*   
*Especially when they don't know the words*  
*Mmm-hmm* [Pitch: descending (starts around A, falls to D), Feeling: satisfied, knowing, complete, Like someone closing a book after finishing a good story, Maybe even a slight chuckle in it (not funny, but... witnessed)]  
  
**[The band holds that last note, letting it fade into silence like smoke rising from a medicine fire]**
