**Lyrics:**  
**Verse 1**   
Heavens sing a gospel tune,   
Sky ablaze, a holy moon.   
From dawn 'til dusk, a story told,   
Wisdom's whispers, brave and bold.  
  
**Chorus**   
May words I speak and heart's deep plea,   
Find favor, Lord, lookin' down on me.   
O Rock, Redeemer, strong and true,   
This soul, this heart, belongs to you.  
  
**Verse 2**   
No words are spoke, no sound is heard,   
Yet 'cross the cosmos, truth is stirred.   
From starry skies to gentle breeze,   
A silent hymn, souls to appease.  
  
**Chorus**   
May words I speak and heart's deep plea,   
Find favor, Lord, lookin' down on me.   
O Rock, Redeemer, strong and true,   
This soul, this heart, belongs to you.  
  
**Verse 3**   
Sun's a bridegroom, robed in gold,   
Runnin' 'cross the sky, so bold.   
East to west, its warmth it spills,   
No darkness hides, from light that thrills.  
  
**Chorus**   
May words I speak and heart's deep plea,   
Find favor, Lord, lookin' down on me.   
O Rock, Redeemer, strong and true,   
This soul, this heart, belongs to you.  
  
**Verse 4**   
Truth's law is pure, sets spirits free,   
Wisdom's touch, brings victory.   
Just words resound, a joyful noise,   
Clear commands uplift, our hearts rejoice.  
  
**Verse 5**   
Reverence is clean, forever stands,   
Judgments righteous, across all lands.   
More precious than a golden prize,   
Sweeter than honey from the hive.  
  
**Chorus**   
May words I speak and heart's deep plea,   
Find favor, Lord, lookin' down on me.   
O Rock, Redeemer, strong and true,   
This soul, this heart, belongs to you.  
  
**Verse 6**   
By them I'm warned, blessings I find,   
Yet who can know the sins behind?   
Cleanse hidden faults, set me free,   
From wayward paths, deliver me.  
  
**Chorus**   
May words I speak and heart's deep plea,   
Find favor, Lord, lookin' down on me.   
O Rock, Redeemer, strong and true,   
This soul, this heart, belongs to you.  
  
**Outro**   
(Oh Lord, this soul, this heart...)   
Belongs to you, (  
Forever and ever...)   
Belongs to you.
