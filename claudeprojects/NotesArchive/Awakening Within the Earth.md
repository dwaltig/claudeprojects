Awakening Within the Earth  
  
[Verse 1] In the hidden depths of the Earth so vast, Lies Awakening,   
[Verse 1] In the hidden depths of the Earth so vast, Lies Awakening,   
waiting to be unmasked. Dormant potential,  
waiting to be unmasked. Dormant potential,  
 unseen but true, Within every heart,   
 unseen but true, Within every heart,   
yet to bloom.  
  
[Chorus] Awaken,   
[Chorus] Awaken,   
oh hearts,   
oh hearts,   
to the Truth's call, Feel the Earth quake,   
to the Truth's call, Feel the Earth quake,   
let the illusions fall. From the depths of our souls,   
let the illusions fall. From the depths of our souls,   
shining and bright, Emerges the path to our destined light.  
  
[Verse 2] The Truth speaks,   
[Verse 2] The Truth speaks,   
and the ground does shake, Revealing wisdom for our souls’ sake. These words are a catalyst,   
and the ground does shake, Revealing wisdom for our souls’ sake. These words are a catalyst,   
breaking the chains, Unearthing the wisdom that forever remains.  
breaking the chains, Unearthing the wisdom that forever remains.

[Bridge] Vast and immeasurable,   
[Bridge] Vast and immeasurable,   
the potential we hold, Not a finite treasure,   
the potential we hold, Not a finite treasure,   
but a promise of gold. All-encompassing awakening in every soul, Together we rise,   
but a promise of gold. All-encompassing awakening in every soul, Together we rise,   
in the light we’ll be whole.  
  
[Chorus] Awaken,   
[Chorus] Awaken,   
oh hearts,   
oh hearts,   
to the Truth's call, Feel the Earth quake,   
to the Truth's call, Feel the Earth quake,   
let the illusions fall. From the depths of our souls,   
let the illusions fall. From the depths of our souls,   
shining and bright, Emerges the path to our destined light.  
  
[Outro] So engage with these teachings,   
[Outro] So engage with these teachings,   
let wisdom flow, Compassionate hearts,   
let wisdom flow, Compassionate hearts,   
let your true nature show. In the heart of the Lotus,   
let your true nature show. In the heart of the Lotus,   
we find our rebirth, As Awakening rises from the sacred Earth.
