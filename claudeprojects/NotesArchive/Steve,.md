Steve,  
   After our last session I noticed my toxic anger started to show itself again. It’s been years since I remember this much pain/discomfort/negativity inappropriate responsiveness, etc.   
  
Personally, I’m hoping this is just a phase. I really don’t like this long-defeated side of me re-emerging.    
  
I’ve had great moments with my TM meditation. Yesterday afternoon, I was out on an afternoon walk in the park, daily constitutional, and decided to sit and practice TM. It was wonderful, just as I started to sit and brought out the mantra, there was a cacophony of the repeated mantra. The light hitting my closed eyelids, built a cathedral/temple in my head. Within a few seconds it was gone, and I was left saying to myself, “Do it again! Do it again!” like a child.
