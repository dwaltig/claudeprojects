Lyrics:   
  
[Intro:]  
Dust in the wind, we rise and fall,  
Carried by the breeze, beyond our call.  
Every step, a story told,  
In this world of dust, we find our hold.  
  
  
[Verse 1: (Karma)]  
Dust settles slow, on an empty street,  
Every footprint marks where souls meet.  
What we’ve done, what’s yet to be,  
The dust of karma won’t let us be free.  
Oh, it lingers long, but never stays,  
We walk in circles, we pave our ways.  
  
[Chorus:]  
As it is, we carry on,  
Dust to dust, before the dawn.  
Nothing’s fixed, yet nothing’s gone,  
In the dust of life, we find the song.  
As it is, the wheel will spin,  
In the empty space, we begin again.  
  
[Instrumental 2-4 bars]  
  
[Verse 2: (Emptiness)]  
Dust floats high, then disappears,  
No weight to hold, no pain, no tears.  
Everything’s empty, yet all things grow,  
Out of the dust, the river flows.  
From the quiet void, the world will rise,  
But nothing’s real when you close your eyes.  
  
[Chorus:]  
As it is, we carry on,  
Dust to dust, before the dawn.  
Nothing’s fixed, yet nothing’s gone,  
In the dust of life, we find the song.  
As it is, the wheel will spin,  
In the empty space, we begin again.  
  
[Instrumental 8-12 bars]  
  
[Bridge: (Middle Way)]  
Between the clouds and the earth below,  
Dust finds a place, where it don’t need to go.  
Not clinging tight, not letting loose,  
The middle way’s the only truth.  
Between extremes, there lies a line,  
Where dust and peace will intertwine.  
  
[Verse 3:]  
Dust on the road, under the sky,  
We walk through time, just passing by.  
In every breath, in every move,  
The dust reminds us—nothing to prove.  
Let it rise, let it fall,  
The dust of life is no weight at all.  
  
[Instrumental 2-4 bars]  
  
[Chorus (Final):]  
As it is, we carry on,  
Dust to dust, before the dawn.  
Nothing’s fixed, yet nothing’s gone,  
In the dust of life, we find the song.  
As it is, the wheel will spin,  
In the empty space, we begin again.  
  
[Outro:]  
Dust in the wind, and so we go,  
What lies ahead, we may never know.  
But in this dust, we find our way,  
As it is, we live today.  
[End]
