Lyrics:   
  
Enlightenment, a gift from deep within,   
A beacon of hope, a light in the dark,   
A power that ignites a spark.  
  
Denial may try to hold us back.  
But the truth will always lead the pack,   
We're all connected, a part of one whole,   
With greatness within us, a mighty goal.  
  
The world's troubles, they may seem so great,   
But with our power, we can change our fate,   
Acceptance, the first step to take,   
To build a brighter future, for our own sake.   
  
Together we stand, united as one,   
Our strength will rise with the morning sun.   
Our potential is limitless, let's make a vow   
To heal our land and make it proud.  
  
So let's be grateful for this gift we've been given,   
A power to change, to make life worth living.   
  
Let's use it wisely to create a better place   
For all of humanity, with love and grace,   
With love and grace, with love and grace,  
  
For all of humanity, with love and grace.
