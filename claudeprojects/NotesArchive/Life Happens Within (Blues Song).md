**Verse 1:**  
  
Things in themselves, they can’t break me, no,  
It’s the weight of my judgment that makes it so.  
Life don’t happen to me—it’s impressions I feel,  
The truth’s deep inside, that’s the part that’s real.  
  
**(Chorus):**  
Let the world come, let the world go,  
The fire of my soul’s the only thing I know.  
Freedom’s in my hands, it’s a choice I can make,  
Character is fate, every step I take.  
  
**Verse 2:**  
  
Desire what’s mine, the rest let it fade,  
I’m harmonizing with the cards I’ve been played.  
Reality bends when the truth is clear,  
The Buddha inside whispers in my ear.  
  
**(Chorus):**  
Let the world come, let the world go,  
The fire of my soul’s the only thing I know.  
Freedom’s in my hands, it’s a choice I can make,  
Character is fate, every step I take.  
  
**Bridge:**  
  
Oh, suffering’s a shadow, it don’t last long,  
The rhythm of the Dharma keeps me strong.  
I see the burning house, but I’m walking free,  
There’s a lotus blooming deep inside of me.  
  
**Verse 3:**  
  
I can direct what’s near, and let go of the rest,  
Each moment’s a chance to put wisdom to the test.  
Life flows like the blues, with its rise and fall,  
But the truth inside me—it answers the call.  
  
**(Chorus):**  
Let the world come, let the world go,  
The fire of my soul’s the only thing I know.  
Freedom’s in my hands, it’s a choice I can make,  
Character is fate, every step I take.  
  
**Outro:**  
  
Oh, life happens within, yeah, that’s where it starts,  
In the rhythm of my soul, in the beat of my heart.  
  
**Reprise **  
**Bridge:**  
  
Oh, suffering’s a shadow, it don’t last long,  
The rhythm of the Dharma keeps me strong.  
I see the burning house, but I’m walking free,  
There’s a lotus blooming deep inside of me.  
  
**Verse 3:**  
  
I can direct what’s near, and let go of the rest,  
Each moment’s a chance to put wisdom to the test.  
Life flows like the blues, with its rise and fall,  
But the truth inside me—it answers the call.  
  
**(Chorus):**  
Let the world come, let the world go,  
The fire of my soul’s the only thing I know.  
Freedom’s in my hands, it’s a choice I can make,  
Character is fate, every step I take.  
  
Oh, life happens within, yeah, that’s where it starts,  
In the rhythm of my soul, in the beat of my heart.
