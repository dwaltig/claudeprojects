# The Appearance  
  
From the depths of earth, it rose so high,  
A Stupa gleaming in the sky,  
Seven treasures in its frame,  
Each one echoing Awakening’s name.  
Each one echoing Awakening’s name.  
Each one echoing Awakening’s name.  
Each one echoing Awakening’s name.  
Each one echoing Awakening’s name.  
Each one echoing Awakening’s name.  
  
Gold that shone with purity bright,  
Silver reflecting wisdom’s light,  
Lapis Lazuli, deep and true,  
With coral white in mystic hue.  
  
Emerald’s life, so vibrant and green,  
Red coral’s fire, a passionate sheen,  
And Cat’s Eye, with its enigmatic gleam,  
All combined in a sacred dream.  
  
Terraces, five thousand strong,  
Arches stretching wide and long,  
Banners fluttered, victory’s song,  
In the wind, where they belong.  
  
Jeweled garlands, hanging low,  
Chimes and bells in gentle flow,  
Echoing truths of life’s fleeting show,  
A call to mindfulness, soft and slow.  
  
Sandalwood and bay leaf scent,  
With pure intent, the air was rent,  
Filling the world with fragrance rare,  
A sign of wisdom everywhere.  
  
Rising high to realms divine,  
Touching where the guardians shine,  
In heavens where the gods reside,  
The Stupa stood, a cosmic guide.  
  
Not just a sight, but an experience profound,  
A cosmic truth in form and sound,  
A bridge between the earth and sky,  
The Dharma’s light that will never die.  
The Dharma’s light that will never die.
