**[Verse 1]**  
**[Verse 1]**  
  
In a world of endless night,  
Hearts are seeds, shining bright,  
Buddhas blooming in our midst,  
Guided by compassion’s kiss.  
  
From the rock to the ancient tree,  
Wisdom flows, setting us free,  
No more borders, no divide,  
Open hearts where love resides.  
  
**[Chorus]**  
**[Chorus]**  
  
We’ll walk side by side in harmony,  
Hand in hand, let our spirits be free,  
With kindness as our only guide,  
We’ll stand together, side by side.

**[Verse 2]**  
  
Harmony crowns our heads with gold,  
Every story, every soul told,  
Acts of love, healing all pain,  
Under the gentle, cleansing rain.  
  
Empathy’s river, deep and wide,  
Flows through us, where dreams reside,  
Unified, we’ll rise and sing,  
Together, we can do anything.

Hand in hand, let our spirits be free,  
With kindness as our only guide,  
We’ll stand together, side by side.

When the world feels dark and cold,  
Remember the stories of old,  
Buddhas bloom where love has grown,  
In open hearts, we find our home.

Let’s build a world where peace abides,  
No more fear, no need to hide,  
With wisdom’s light to lead the way,  
We’ll find joy in every day.  
  
From the mountains to the sea,  
We’ll sing our song, wild and free,  
Together, we’ll heal, we’ll grow,  
Side by side, let our love show.

Hand in hand, let our spirits be free,  
With kindness as our only guide,  
We’ll stand together, side by side.

We’ll stand together, side by side,  
In this journey, let love be our guide,  
With open hearts and spirits wide,  
We’ll find our way, side by side.
