Lyrics:  
Verse 1:  
Yo, the strength of kindness, yeah, it’s building my crib,  
Forbearance wraps me up, tight like a bib.  
In the arms of peace, I’m findin' what’s real,  
Abstract truths, yeah, it’s light that I feel.  
  
Clods, sticks, threats, they try to bring me down,  
But remember me, I’m standing, holdin’ my ground.  
Spirit stretches wide, from the east to the west,  
I’m a guide through the lands, never settle for less.  
  
Chorus:  
Whispers in the mountains, echoes in the deep,  
Teachings in the flow, for those who wanna keep.  
To the brave who walks this path, when I’m long gone,  
My creations stand tall, they ain’t ever alone.  
  
To the brave who walks this path, when I’m long gone,  
My creations stand tall, they ain’t ever alone.  
  
Verse 2:  
For the brave who spread this Sūtra, holdin' it tight,  
When I leave, my forms rise, shinin' so bright.  
Taunts in the air, threats try to divide,  
But my guardians stay posted, ready to ride.  
  
Solo studyin' under skies that ain't known,  
Mountains or wild lands, he's never alone.  
I'm right there, standin’ with him, in the shadows I roam,  
He’s got the strength, no matter how far he’s gone.  
  
Chorus:  
Whispers in the mountains, echoes in the deep,  
Teachings in the flow, for those who wanna keep.  
To the brave who walks this path, when I’m long gone,  
My creations stand tall, they ain’t ever alone.  
  
To the brave who walks this path, when I’m long gone,  
My creations stand tall, they ain’t ever alone.  
  
Bridge:  
I show my face, yeah, that light’s gonna gleam,  
Remind him of vows, forgotten in dreams.  
In the wild night or the silent retreat,  
I’m filling his mind, keepin' him on beat.  
  
Gods and goblins, they come through, unseen,  
Stay blessin' him daily, keep his path clean.  
Serene flowin' through, when he's preaching or solo,  
I’m right there with him, always in the glow, bro.  
  
Chorus:  
Whispers in the mountains, echoes in the deep,  
Teachings in the flow, for those who wanna keep.  
To the brave who walks this path, when I’m long gone,  
My creations stand tall, they ain’t ever alone.  
  
To the brave who walks this path, when I’m long gone,  
My creations stand tall, they ain’t ever alone.
