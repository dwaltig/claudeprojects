**Lyrics:**  
**(Verse 1)**   
Sunrise hits the window, just another day begins   
Same old traffic hummin', wonderin' if anybody wins   
Try to keep my head up, navigate the rush and flow   
Put a little purpose in the places that I go   
Sometimes feels like walkin' uphill in the pourin' rain   
Searchin' for the shelter, tryin' to ease the strain  
  
**(Chorus)**   
Yeah, the world keeps throwin' static on the frequency   
A little bit of worry always finds its way to me   
But I'm learnin' how to turn the dial, tune the bad noise down   
Keep my two feet steady on this ever-spinnin' ground   
'Cause underneath the worry, doubt, and fear   
I'm listenin' for that signal comin' through so clear   
Waitin' on, livin' for that clearer sound   
Yeah, the hope and peace that still spin 'round  
  
**(Verse 2)**   
Maybe it's a headline, maybe just a word unkind   
Or another roadblock messin' with your peace of mind   
Feel that pressure buildin', whisperin' things you shouldn't hear   
Tryin' hard to pull you back towards the path of fear   
See the grey clouds gather, feel a chill run down your spine   
Lookin' for a breakthrough, searchin' for a sign  
  
**(Chorus)**   
Yeah, the world keeps throwin' static on the frequency   
A little bit of worry always finds its way to me   
But I'm learnin' how to turn the dial, tune the bad noise down   
Keep my two feet steady on this ever-spinnin' ground   
'Cause underneath the worry, doubt, and fear   
I'm listenin' for that signal comin' through so clear   
Waitin' on, livin' for that clearer sound   
Yeah, the hope and peace that still spin 'round  
  
**(Bridge)**   
Sure, the shadows try to pull me back sometimes, it's true   
Make me feel I'm stuck right here with nothin' I can do   
But every single lesson, every time I didn't break   
Is like a tiny seed I planted for goodness sake!   
Reachin' for the sunlight, growin' strong and high   
Plantin' hope right here beneath this wide-open sky   
This feelin' deep inside just helps me understand   
The future's somethin' buildin' right here in my hands!  
  
**(Guitar Solo - Melodic, builds with more energy and optimism than before)**  
  
**(Chorus)**   
Yeah, the world keeps throwin' static on the frequency (Oh, the static!)   
A little bit of worry always finds its way to me (Finds its way to me!)   
But I'm learnin' how to turn the dial, tune the bad noise down (Tune it down!)   
Keep my two feet steady on this ever-spinnin' ground (Feet on the ground!)   
'Cause underneath the worry, doubt, and fear (No more fear!)   
I'm listenin' for that signal comin' through so clear (Comin' through clear!)   
Waitin' on, livin' for that clearer sound   
Yeah, the hope and peace that still spin 'round! (Spinning 'round and 'round!)  
  
**(Outro)**   
Hear that clearer sound...   
Oh, I hear it comin' now...   
Tune the static down... let the good times spin around...   
Plantin' seeds of hope... yeah...   
That clearer sound...   
(Fade out with a stronger beat, layered vocals/harmonies on "Clearer Sound," ending on a positive chord)
