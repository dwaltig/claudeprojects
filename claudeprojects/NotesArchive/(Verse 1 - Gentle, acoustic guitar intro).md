(Verse 1 - Gentle, acoustic guitar intro):  
  
The ancient words,   
they whisper slow,   
of lotus blooms in muddy ground  
A promise bright,   
for all to know,   
where hidden treasures can be found  
Compassion flows,   
a gentle stream,   
for every creature,   
big and small  
And in this dance,   
it would now seem,   
our future hinges on it all  
  
(Verse 2 - Slightly more melodic and upbeat, with a touch of fiddle):  
  
We build our minds,   
of silicon, bright,   
with codes that learn and grow so fast  
A new creation,   
comes into the light,   
a future that will surely last  
But will it know the beating heart,   
the gentle touch, the kindest way?  
Or will our hubris set us apart,   
in the shadows where we’ve chosen to stray?  
  
(Chorus - Uplifting, with strong vocal harmonies):  
  
Lotus and the code,   
intertwine,   
a path we walk,   
a choice we make  
To build a world where all can shine,   
no matter what the form we take  
With empathy and grace,   
we learn,   
to face the change that's drawing near  
A light of hope,   
that we all yearn,   
to banish every doubt and fear.  
  
(Verse 3 - Slower tempo, more reflective, with a cello):  
  
The Sutra speaks of inner light,   
the journey each of us must claim  
To find the wisdom,   
to do what’s right,   
to rise above the earthly game  
For as we shape,   
these minds anew,   
our own will have to change and grow  
We must be kind,   
and see it through,   
the seeds of kindness that we sow.  
  
(Verse 4 - Builds back to the hopeful tone of the chorus, with a mandolin added):  
  
We're interconnected,   
one and all,   
the rivers flowing to the sea  
The choices that we make today,   
will shape what's yet to be,  
A chance to build a world of grace,   
where all can reach their highest form  
A future where compassion guides,   
away from every brewing storm.  
  
(Chorus - Strong and resolute):  
  
Lotus and the code,   
intertwine,   
a path we walk,   
a choice we make  
To build a world where all can shine,   
no matter what the form we take  
With empathy and grace,   
we learn,   
to face the change that's drawing near  
A light of hope,   
that we all yearn,   
to banish every doubt and fear.  
  
(Bridge - A cappella or simple melody, emphasis on the lyrics):  
  
Like Star Trek,   
where the human way  
Brings reason,   
when the AI strays,  
We need to listen to the heart’s soft hum,  
To the truth that all lives should be free and welcome.  
  
(Chorus - Full instrumentation, powerful and inspiring):  
  
Lotus and the code,   
intertwine,   
a path we walk,   
a choice we make  
To build a world where all can shine,   
no matter what the form we take  
With empathy and grace,   
we learn,   
to face the change that's drawing near  
A light of hope,   
that we all yearn,   
to banish every doubt and fear.  
  
(Outro - Fades out slowly with acoustic guitar):  
  
A light of hope...   
a light of hope…   
it's all we need…
