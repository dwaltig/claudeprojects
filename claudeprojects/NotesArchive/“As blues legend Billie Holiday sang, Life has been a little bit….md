“As blues legend Billie Holiday sang, "Life has been a little bit of everything all rolled into one / If I should ever go away / All of the good is rolled into one," expressing the Buddhist insight that all of life's experiences--joy and pain--are necessary to the path of wisdom.”  appears to be a "phantom quote"—a mix of lyrics from different eras that your memory has stitched together (likely the Meredith Brooks "rolled into one" line mixed with a classic ballad title). It does not appear in Billie Holiday's discography.  
Since we want to express the **Buddhist insight that joy and pain are inseparable**, I found an *authentic* Billie Holiday lyric that captures this perfectly.  
  
## The Best "Billie Holiday" Replacement  
  
From her classic song **"Don't Explain"** (written by Holiday herself along with Arthur Herzog Jr.), she explicitly sings about the non-duality of love, suffering, and happiness.  
"Hush now, don't explain.  
You're my joy and pain."  
**Why this works for our paper:**  
* **It is authentic:** She wrote it and sang it.  
* **It fits your theme:** The phrase "Joy and pain" concisely expresses the Buddhist concept that suffering and happiness are intertwined (like the lotus growing in mud).  
* **Chicago Citation:**  
    * **Bibliography:** Holiday, Billie, and Arthur Herzog Jr. "Don't Explain." Recorded by Billie Holiday. Decca, 1946.  
    * **Note:** Billie Holiday and Arthur Herzog Jr., "Don't Explain," recorded by Billie Holiday (Decca, 1946).  
  
  
## Alternative Option (The "Rolled Into One" Sentiment)  
  
If you are attached to the phrase **"Happy and sad... all rolled into one,"** you might be thinking of the song **"Glad and Sorry"** by the British rock band **The Faces** (1973).  
* **Lyric:** *"Can you show me a dream? ... I'm glad and sorry, happy and sad / All rolled into one."*  
* **Note:** While this hits the "Buddhist" sentiment of non-duality perfectly, it is 1970s folk-rock, not Billie Holiday jazz/blues.  
**My recommendation:** Use the **"Don't Explain"** lyric. It is short, powerful, indisputably Billie Holiday, and nails the "wisdom of experience" theme you are writing about.
