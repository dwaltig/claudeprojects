To understand the "treasure tower" within yourself, you would recognize it as your **innate enlightened nature or the state of Buddhahood inherent within all people**. This magnificent state of life is taught to exist within the lives of individuals who embrace the teachings of the Mystic Law.  
  
Here's how the sources explain how you would "know" or actualize this treasure tower within yourself:  
  
*   ***Symbol of Innate Potential**: The emergence of the colossal stūpa from the earth in the "Ceremony in the Air" is an allegory for the **discovery and manifestation of one's innate enlightened nature**, which lies dormant within all living beings. The earth symbolizes the lives of ordinary people, and the stūpa represents Buddhahood [3].  
*   **Embodiment of Spiritual Journey**: The very form of the treasure tower can be seen as a blueprint for spiritual practice. Its dimensions symbolize the five destinies of suffering and the 250 precepts, embodying the spiritual journey built from human suffering and the practices that lead to its cessation.  
*   **Internal Virtues**: The seven treasures adorning the stūpa, such as gold, silver, and lapis lazuli, symbolize **spiritual virtues** like wisdom, purity of conduct, and a clear understanding of the Law. These are considered the ultimate riches, representing the inner richness and dignity of an awakened life, rather than external gems [4].  
*   **An Internal Reality**: The "Ceremony in the Air" is described not as a distant, historical narrative but as a "realm transcending time and space" that takes place in the "here and now.” This is understood through the doctrine of "three thousand realms in a single moment of life" (*ichinen sanzen*), meaning that **all phenomena, including Buddhahood, are contained within a single moment of an individual's life**. Thus, the Ceremony, and by extension the treasure tower, is an ever-present, internal reality that can be accessed and experienced by awakening one's inherent potential. The commentary states it is perceived "not only with the eyes, also with the mind" and with one's "original nature.”  
*   **Nichiren Buddhism's Practical Approach**: Nichiren Daishonin taught that **"the men and women who embrace the Lotus Sutra are themselves the treasure tower**.” He transformed this profound allegory into a practical method for universal enlightenment, emphasizing that it is a tangible reality to be actualized in daily life.  
*   **Chanting *Nam-myoho-renge-kyo***: Nichiren established the **chanting of *++Nam-myoho-renge-kyo++*** as the direct means for ordinary people to actualize their own Buddhahood. This practice empowers individuals to fulfill a cosmic mission and share the Law with others [9].  
*   **The Gohonzon**: Nichiren inscribed the Omandala Gohonzon as a "physical blueprint of the Ceremony in the Air" and a **representation of the enlightenment state inherent in all life**. The central inscription of *++Nam-myoho-renge-ky++*o on the Gohonzon represents the treasure tower and the fundamental Mystic Law. Chanting to the Gohonzon is described as a "dynamic process of awakening one's own mission as a Bodhisattva of the Earth and an active participant" in the mission to create a peaceful world.  
  
In essence, you would know the treasure tower within yourself by **awakening and manifesting your innate enlightened nature and its accompanying spiritual virtues through consistent spiritual practice,** particularly through the chanting of *Nam-myoho-renge-kyo* as taught in Nichiren Buddhism. This transforms you from an observer into an active participant in this cosmic event, making it a present reality.
