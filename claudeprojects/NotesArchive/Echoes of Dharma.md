Verse 1:  
In the teachings of the Dharma,   
In the teachings of the Dharma,   
there’s a joy that’s hard to find,  
A rare flower blooms,   
A rare flower blooms,   
like the udumbara vine.  
When you hear the sacred words,   
When you hear the sacred words,   
and your heart begins to sing,  
Just a smile or a single word,   
Just a smile or a single word,   
it’s an offering to the King.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, it’s a rare sight to see,   
Oh, it’s a rare sight to see,   
like a flower in the night,  
When someone finds the light,   
When someone finds the light,   
and they sing out in delight.  
From the past to the present,   
From the past to the present,   
and the future yet to come,  
Every word of praise,   
Every word of praise,   
it’s an offering to the One.  
  
Verse 2:  
The Buddha spoke to Śāriputra,   
The Buddha spoke to Śāriputra,   
with wisdom deep and true,  
To those who hear the Dharma,   
To those who hear the Dharma,   
and to those who sing it too.  
It’s a natural thing to honor those who sacrifice,  
Leading us to see what’s worthy,   
Leading us to see what’s worthy,   
guiding us to paradise.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, it’s a rare sight to see,   
Oh, it’s a rare sight to see,   
like a flower in the night,  
When someone finds the light,   
When someone finds the light,   
and they sing out in delight.  
From the past to the present,   
From the past to the present,   
and the future yet to come,  
Every word of praise,   
Every word of praise,   
it’s an offering to the One.

Bridge:  
Even a simple “Wonderful,”   
Even a simple “Wonderful,”   
from the depths of your soul,  
Is a testament to the power,   
Is a testament to the power,   
of the Dharma that makes you whole.  
It’s a reminder of the greatness,   
It’s a reminder of the greatness,   
we all can strive to be,  
In the echoes of the Buddha’s words,   
In the echoes of the Buddha’s words,   
we find our destiny.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, it’s a rare sight to see,   
Oh, it’s a rare sight to see,   
like a flower in the night,  
When someone finds the light,   
When someone finds the light,   
and they sing out in delight.  
From the past to the present,   
From the past to the present,   
and the future yet to come,  
Every word of praise,   
Every word of praise,   
it’s an offering to the One.  
  
Outro:  
So rejoice, my friends,   
So rejoice, my friends,   
in the Dharma’s sweet embrace,  
Let your heart be a temple,   
Let your heart be a temple,   
let your soul be a sacred space.  
For in every act of praise,   
For in every act of praise,   
there’s a seed of purest grace,  
A gift to the Buddhas,   
A gift to the Buddhas,   
in every time and place.
