Lyrics:   
Verse 1:  
For countless ages, I wandered alone  
Searchin' for wisdom, a truth to call home  
Finally found it, that light in the dark  
Now I'm here to share it, to light up your heart  
  
Chorus:  
It ain't about keepin', it's all about sharin'  
The truth that I found, it's meant for declarin'  
So listen up closely, and spread it around  
'Cause the treasure we share is the treasure we've found  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
Verse 2:  
The path ain't easy, it's hard to believe  
But the truth that I speak, it's yours to receive  
Don't try to hold it, just let it flow free  
'Cause the more that you give, the more you will be  
  
Chorus:  
It ain't about keepin', it's all about sharin'  
The truth that I found, it's meant for declarin'  
So listen up closely, and spread it around  
'Cause the treasure we share is the treasure we've found  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
Bridge:  
Our riches ain't measured by what we can hold  
But by what we let go, that's pure heart of gold  
Our fears and delusions, they're weighing us down  
Let 'em go, spread the word, let love go to town  
  
Verse 3:  
So take this message and sing it out loud  
From the highest mountain to the thickest crowd  
With all of your heart, let the whole world know  
That's how the light of wisdom continues to grow  
  
Chorus:  
It ain't about keepin', it's all about sharin'  
The truth that I found, it's meant for declarin'  
So listen up closely, and spread it around  
'Cause the treasure we share is the treasure we've found  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
Outro:  
The treasure we share is the treasure we've found  
Yeah, the treasure we share is the treasure we've found
