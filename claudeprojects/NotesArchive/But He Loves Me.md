Verse 1:  
I was caught in a battle, a war I didn't choose,    
Words like daggers, left me battered and bruised.    
They said I was worthless, that I'd never be,    
But I was fighting, trying to set myself free.    
But I was fighting, trying to set myself free.    
  
Chorus:  
Every night I’d see them, demons at my door,    
Feasting on my heart, taking what they came for.    
But I found the words, to set me free,    
I cried out loud, "But He loves me!"    
I cried out loud, "But He loves me!"    
I cried out loud, "But He loves me!"    
I cried out loud, "But He loves me!"

I knew my mind was spinning, trying to find the truth,    
Caught in their shadows, trying to break through.    
Then came the night, I finally knew the key,    
Spoke those words, "But He loves me."    
Spoke those words, "But He loves me."    
Spoke those words, "But He loves me."

They spat out the darkness, let go of my soul,    
With an oath of protection, they made me whole.    
I found my strength in what they couldn’t see,    
That even in their darkness, love set me free.    
That even in their darkness, love set me free.

Now I stand tall, no longer afraid,    
Found my own light, in the path that I made.    
With love as my armor, I faced what I had to see,    
And it all began with, "But He loves me."    
And it all began with, "But He loves me."    
And it all began with, "But He loves me."    
And it all began with, "But He loves me."
