Verse 1  
In the realm of fleeting days,  
Where conflict’s shadows loom,  
Walks Medicine-King, Bodhisattva bright,  
Amidst the world’s deep gloom.

Star-King-Flower raised a plea,  
To Buddha’s wisdom pure,  
“Why forsake the heavens’ bliss,  
For hardships to endure?”

With love, we find our way,  
In Medicine-King’s footsteps true,  
We’ll see a brighter day.

Buddha spoke with gentle grace,  
A tale of past revealed,  
Of Medicine-King’s boundless heart,  
With truths and love concealed.

In a life once lived, he cast aside,  
Attachments strong and deep,  
Even his body, free he gave,  
In sacrifice complete.

He walked with purpose true,  
A beacon for all sentient souls,  
To guide and to renew.

For in the depths of suffering,  
The light of wisdom grows,  
And through our own determined hearts,  
The path to freedom shows.

Or hardships that we face,  
With certainty of our own light,  
We move with endless grace.

Through stories old and wise,  
That in our hearts, the truth is clear,  
Enlightenment shall rise.

In Medicine-King’s way,  
With love and help from those around,  
We’ll find a brighter day.
