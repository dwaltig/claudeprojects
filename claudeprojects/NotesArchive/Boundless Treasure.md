# Boundless Treasure  
  
Verse 1 — Bluesy Lament  
  
I built my little fence, thought my soul was free  
Carved a quiet corner where no storm could reach me  
Satisfied with crumbs, called that fortune mine  
Never saw the treasure just beyond the line  
That small-comfort silence kept my spirit tied  
Till a restless wind began to question why  
  
Chorus — Folk Revelation  
  
Then a whisper in the wind, a voice that wouldn’t hide  
“Friend, the greatness you were born for is burning deep inside!  
Not just a shallow peace, but a wildfire in your soul  
A boundless treasure waiting to make the broken whole.  
Your great hidden heart, wide as the endless skies,  
An infinite potential you can no longer disguise.”  
  
Verse 2 — The Foolish Man Reimagined  
  
Like a ragged wanderer who never knew his worth,  
Carrying a fortune sewn the day he came to earth,  
A priceless jewel hidden deep inside his coat,  
Years of hungry miles with not a single note.  
The wealth was there within him, no gift to receive,  
Only a light to uncover, only a truth to believe.  
  
Bridge — From Me to We  
  
Can’t just guard my own heart, can’t walk this road alone,  
True living’s in the giving, in the seeds of love we’ve sown.  
From narrow self-protection to a vision broad and clear,  
Every mile of exile taught me to draw others near.  
The end of private striving was only the start,  
To lift the tired and fallen with an open heart.  
  
Outro — Resolute & Hopeful  
  
No longer blind, with my eyes open wide,  
I’ve got a universal spirit with nowhere left to hide.  
I’ll plant a wilder garden where every soul can bloom,  
Step out of that lonely silence, leave the self-made room.  
On a boundless journey, finding joy that won’t decay,  
In every simple kindness, lighting someone’s way.
