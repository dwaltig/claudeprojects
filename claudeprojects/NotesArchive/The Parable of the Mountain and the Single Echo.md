# The Parable of the Mountain and the Single Echo  
In the vast and dusty realm of *Saṃsāra*, there stood the towering peak of *Anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*, the Mountain of Unsurpassed, Complete, and Perfect Enlightenment. Many believed that to reach its summit, one must endure countless lifetimes of arduous journeying.  
At the lower slopes of the mountain lived a great ascetic named Ardhaka. He was the very model of strenuous effort. For eons, Ardhaka undertook the gradual path, cultivating wisdom and merit by performing heroic acts of self-sacrifice. He spent twelve hundred years preparing his body and then illuminated countless worlds by setting himself alight, an offering he deemed the supreme devotion to the Dharma. After being reborn, he constructed 84,000 stupas and even burned his own arms for 72,000 years, believing that only such magnitude of suffering could ensure his ultimate goal. Ardhaka practiced with devotion, striving to construct the state of Buddhahood over time, driven by a belief that his enlightenment was a distant, earned reward.  
Near the base of the mountain, dwelling amidst the common dust, was a humble merchant's daughter named Jia. She had neither the strength nor the time to climb the path of a thousand kalpas. She watched Ardhaka’s sacrifices with awe, convinced that the ultimate truth was forever beyond her grasp.  
One day, as the Wise Teacher descended from the highest peak, he paused between the laboring Ardhaka and the longing Jia. Ardhaka had reached a point of exhaustion, having sacrificed all he had, but he still perceived the peak as miles above him.  
The Teacher looked upon them both and began to speak the **Wonderful Dharma (*Saddharma*)**. He spoke of the **One Vehicle (*Ekayāna*)**, explaining that the three paths Ardhaka knew were not final destinations, but provisional, **Skillful Means (*Upāya*)** designed to lead all beings to a single, magnificent, jeweled carriage.  
Then, the Teacher turned to Jia and declared: “The essence of this entire supreme teaching—the **Lotus Flower of the Wonderful Dharma**—is not contingent upon your effort or your suffering. The purity of the lotus emerges unsullied from the muddy world of suffering because the purity was always already there”.  
He explained that all beings, without exception, inherently possess the **Buddha-nature (*Tathāgatagarbha*)**, which is pure and luminous, obscured only by temporary defilements. The goal, therefore, does not need to be constructed; it must simply be recognized.  
The Teacher spoke a single **phrase**—a *gāthā*—which contained the entirety of the Supreme Law. Upon hearing this phrase, Jia did not intellectually grasp its complexity, nor did she perform any great act of austerity. Instead, a profound shift occurred within her heart: she experienced a **"moment’s thought" of radiant, spiritual joy**. This joy was not a mundane emotion, but a deep faith and intuitive recognition—the seed of Buddhahood within her resonating with the supreme Dharma.  
Immediately, the Teacher gave his ultimate assurance to Jia, declaring, “I assure you, even for this single moment of joy at hearing this phrase of the Sūtra, you shall attain **Anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi**”. The promise was instantaneous because her consciousness had, for that instant, manifested the reality of the Buddha realm inherent within it.  
Ardhaka, the paragon of strenuous practice, heard this exchange and was astonished. He had spent innumerable eons burning his body, while this humble girl was assured the same goal through a single, effortless internal response.  
The Teacher smiled: “Ardhaka, your supreme sacrifices were honored and necessary *upāya* for you; they were the path of profound devotion. Jia’s moment of joyful faith is the necessary *upāya* for her; it is the affective alignment with the ultimate truth. The ultimate value of both your eons of effort and her single moment of joy is derived not from the magnitude of the act, but from the **Supreme Nature of the Dharma**—the object of devotion—which makes the attainment inevitable for both of you”.  
Thus, the Teacher demonstrated that while practice is required, it is transformed: the **anxious striving** of the past is replaced by the **confident and joyful expression** of an already-guaranteed future. The gateway to the highest enlightenment is open to the greatest ascetic and the ordinary person alike, provided their hearts respond to the Wonderful Dharma.
