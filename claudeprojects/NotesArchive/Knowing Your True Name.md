**Knowing Your True Name – A Bluesy Folk Journey of Inner Discovery**  
This soulful blues-folk track follows a restless search for purpose that ends not in distant horizons but in a hidden jewel within. Its chorus—*“joy ain’t ending suffering, but knowing your true name”*—captures a sudden, electrifying recognition of an ever-present wholeness. A song of rapturous awakening, it invites listeners to feel that rush of pure aliveness and remember: *you were never broken—you’re already whole.*

**Knowing Your True Name*** *(slow, finger-picked blues-folk)  
  
Verse 1  
I walked these dusty backroads, holes worn through my shoes,  
Chasing fortunes I imagined across the far-off blues.  
Felt like a prodigal drifter, lost and on my own,  
Never guessed the richest treasure was stitched in my own home.  
  
Chorus  
Then I heard a whisper, low and ancient-clear:  
“The deepest truth you’re chasing isn’t out there, it’s here.  
It’s a timeless song within you, an ever-living flame—  
And the joy is not escape, but knowing your true name.”  
  
Verse 2  
I spent my days a-strivin’, stacking honest pay,  
Built my tower of good deeds, mile by mile, day by day.  
Thought that peace would crown me after sweat and pain,  
But one flash of seeing washed it clean as rain.  
  
Chorus  
Then I heard a whisper, low and ancient-clear:  
“The deepest truth you’re chasing isn’t out there, it’s here.  
It’s a timeless song within you, an ever-living flame—  
And the joy is not escape, but knowing your true name.”  
  
Bridge  
This isn’t quiet shelter when the thunder’s finally gone,  
It’s the shock of sudden wonder, the light before the dawn—  
A rush of living power, fierce and free within,  
To face this troubled world and know where to begin.  
  
(bluesy guitar solo, mournful with a lift of hope)  
  
Chorus (final)  
Oh, I heard that whisper, low and ancient-clear:  
“The deepest truth you’re chasing isn’t out there, it’s here.  
It’s a timeless song within you, an ever-living flame—  
And the joy is not escape, but knowing your true name.”  
  
Outro  
No matter where you’ve wandered or what you think you lack,  
That ageless truth is waiting—there’s no turning back.  
Let that joy rise through you, let it fill you whole;  
You were never broken—child, you’re already whole.  
(Repeat “you’re already whole,” guitars fading to one last ringing chord.)
