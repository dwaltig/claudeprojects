O Honored One, our noble guide,  
You grant peace to all, both far and wide,  
With promises of Buddhahood, we're reassured,  
In solace and fulfillment, our hearts secured.  
  
In Chapter 13 of the Lotus Sūtra, Maha-Prajāpatī Bhikṣuṇī, Yaśodharā Bhikṣuṇī, and their attendants perform these verses. Life presents us with a multitude of desires, some of which may remain unknown. We tend to believe that fulfilling these desires leads to happiness and tranquility. Yet, beneath these yearnings, the quest for liberation resides. These women recognized that enlightenment is the pathway to achieving such liberation. The mere realization that this objective is attainable is enough to evoke a sense of satisfaction.
