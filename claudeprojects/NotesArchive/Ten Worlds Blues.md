# Ten Worlds Blues  
  
(Verse 1) Well, I’ve been walkin’ this path, singin’ my heart out, Share my music, try to make sense of the doubt. Some folks say, “That’s a beautiful tune,” Some folks say, “That’s the strangest thing I’ve ever known.”  
  
(Chorus) But I see those faces, mirrored in the light, Every heart a story, shinin’ through the night. Some souls lookin’ for comfort, some souls searchin’ for a fight, It’s a tapestry of spirits, woven in the light.  
  
(Verse 2) One soul tells me, “You got a gift, brother, keep on playin’ the game.” One soul tells me, “You’re treadin’ on sacred ground, you should be ashamed.” One soul hears the whisper, of a truth they’ve never known, One soul hears the echo, of a world they’ve left alone.  
  
(Chorus) But I see those faces, mirrored in the light, Every heart a story, shinin’ through the night. Some souls lookin’ for comfort, some souls searchin’ for a fight, It’s a tapestry of spirits, woven in the light.  
  
(Bridge) Oh, maybe it’s a struggle, maybe it’s a dance, But the heart knows what it’s feelin’, ain’t no need for a chance. To judge or to question, to condemn or to embrace, Just a journey of the spirit, seekin’ its own space.  
  
(Chorus) But I see those faces, mirrored in the light, Every heart a story, shinin’ through the night. Some souls lookin’ for comfort, some souls searchin’ for a fight, It’s a tapestry of spirits, woven in the light.  
  
(Outro) And maybe, just maybe, we’re all searchin’ for the same thing, A little peace in the darkness, a little song to make us sing. So I’ll keep on playin’ my music, keep on shinin’ my light, ‘Cause even in the darkness, there’s beauty in the night.
