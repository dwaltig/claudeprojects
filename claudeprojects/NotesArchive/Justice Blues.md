[Verse 1]  
In a world so cold, where shadows play,  
I'm walkin' down this lonesome road each day,  
With a heart full of faith and a mind so clear,  
I seek the truth, there's no room for fear.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, justice blues, sing me a song,  
Where the weak are strong, and the right belong,  
In this world of strife, where the truth must rise,  
We'll find our way under righteous skies.  
  
[Verse 2]  
I've seen the wicked laugh, seen the innocent fall,  
But I know deep down there's a higher call,  
With every step I take, with every prayer I send,  
I'm fightin' for the light, on which we all depend.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, justice blues, sing me a song,  
Where the weak are strong, and the right belong,  
In this world of strife, where the truth must rise,  
We'll find our way under righteous skies.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[Bridge]  
Let the winds of change blow through this land,  
With the strength of love, we’ll make a stand,  
For the righteous path and the hearts so pure,  
In the arms of justice, we'll endure.  
  
[Verse 3]  
When the dark clouds gather and the thunder rolls,  
I'll keep my faith, I'll protect my soul,  
For I know one day, the dawn will break,  
And justice will reign, for goodness' sake.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, justice blues, sing me a song,  
Where the weak are strong, and the right belong,  
In this world of strife, where the truth must rise,  
We'll find our way under righteous skies.  
  
[Outro]  
So raise your voice, let the truth be told,  
In this weary world, let our hearts be bold,  
With the justice blues, we'll pave the way,  
With the justice blues, we'll pave the way,  
With the justice blues, we'll pave the way,  
For a brighter dawn and a fairer day.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, justice blues, sing me a song,  
Where the weak are strong, and the right belong,  
In this world of strife, where the truth must rise,  
We'll find our way under righteous skies.  
  
[Outro]  
So raise your voice, let the truth be told,  
In this weary world, let our hearts be bold,  
With the justice blues, we'll pave the way,  
For a brighter dawn and a fairer day.
