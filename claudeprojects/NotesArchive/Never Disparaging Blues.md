*(Verse 1)*  
*(Verse 1)*  
I walk this road, head held high,  
Ain’t no shame in my eye,  
I see the light in every soul,  
No matter the pain, no matter the toll.  
  
*(Chorus)*  
*(Chorus)*  
Oh, I won’t ever, no, I won’t ever put you down,  
You’re a Buddha in the making, wearin’ a hidden crown,  
Even when you scorn, even when you bruise,  
I keep on singin’ this Never Disparaging Blues.  
  
*(Verse 2)*  
*(Verse 2)*  
They laughed at me, threw stones at my feet,  
But I kept on bowin’ to everyone I’d meet,  
“Don’t you know?” I’d say with a smile so true,  
“You’ll be a Buddha, I believe in you.”  
  
*(Chorus)*  
*(Chorus)*  
Oh, I won’t ever, no, I won’t ever put you down,  
You’re a Buddha in the making, wearin’ a hidden crown,  
Even when you scorn, even when you bruise,  
I keep on singin’ this Never Disparaging Blues.  
I keep on singin’ this Never Disparaging Blues.

*(Bridge)*  
*(Bridge)*  
Through the rain and through the storm,  
I hold on to the truth I’ve sworn,  
Every soul’s got a spark inside,  
In this world, there’s no need to hide.  
  
*(Verse 3)*  
*(Verse 3)*  
Years went by, they saw the light,  
The ones who hurt me, saw their own might,  
And as they bowed with respect anew,  
I smiled and said, “I always knew.”  
  
*(Chorus)*  
*(Chorus)*  
Oh, I won’t ever, no, I won’t ever put you down,  
You’re a Buddha in the making, wearin’ a hidden crown,  
Even when you scorn, even when you bruise,  
I keep on singin’ this Never Disparaging Blues.

So when you’re low, and feelin’ small,  
Remember there’s a Buddha in us all,  
Just keep on walkin’, in these worn-out shoes,  
And sing along with the Never Disparaging Blues.  
And sing along with the Never Disparaging Blues.
