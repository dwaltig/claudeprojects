Dear Connie,  
  
I appreciate you sharing the recent video footage and letter concerning our neighbor. After reviewing the materials, I noticed several concerning incidents:  
  
1. The first two videos show our neighbor exhibiting signs of emotional distress.  
2. The subsequent videos depict police interaction at his door.  
3. Another set of videos captures the neighbor undressing, leading to full exposure.  
4. Lastly, I received a letter from neighbors across the street expressing their concerns.  
  
Having encountered this individual on several occasions, I couldn't help but notice behavior suggesting the influence of substances, possibly heavy drugs. It is imperative that TNCZ, his property management company, is made aware of these incidents to ensure they are providing tenants who contribute positively to our community's safety and well-being.

Regarding your intention to write a letter to the tenant, I fully support this approach. It would be beneficial to hear more about the content of your proposed letter. In addition, plan to send a copy of this correspondence to TNCZ to keep them informed and involved in resolving this situation.  
  
Thank you for addressing this matter promptly. I look forward to your response and any suggestions on how we can collaboratively approach this issue.  
  
Best regards,
