Lyrics  
  
[Intro]  
  
[Verse 1]  
From Dukha’s veil, I break, I rise,  
Enlightenment’s dawn, it lights the skies.  
Emancipation’s wings now soar,  
Higher, brighter than before.  
  
[Chorus]  
No more bound, no more confined,  
Reason reigns, it’s clear, it’s kind.  
Knowledge pours, a potent stream,  
Feeding every single dream.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Dogma’s chains, they crack, they fall,  
Truth stands tall, it calls, it calls.  
Independent thought, a flame, a fire,  
Burning bright with pure desire.  
  
[Chorus]  
Creativity unleashed, untamed,  
A boundless sea, unashamed.  
Explorin’ realms unseen, unknown,  
Breaking barriers, all alone.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[Bridge]  
Individuality, a gem, a star,  
Shining strong, it travels far.  
Diversity, a vibrant hue,  
Each voice distinct, each one true.  
  
[Chorus]  
No more bound, no more confined,  
Reason reigns, it’s clear, it’s kind.  
Knowledge pours, a potent stream,  
Feeding every single dream.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Dogma’s chains, they crack, they fall,  
Truth stands tall, it calls, it calls.  
Independent thought, a flame, a fire,  
Burning bright with pure desire.  
  
[Chorus]  
Creativity unleashed, untamed,  
A boundless sea, unashamed.  
Explorin’ realms unseen, unknown,  
Breaking barriers, all alone.  
  
[Chorus]  
Creativity unleashed, untamed,  
A boundless sea, unashamed.  
Explorin’ realms unseen, unknown,  
Breaking barriers, all alone.  
  
[Chorus]  
Creativity unleashed, untamed,  
A boundless sea, unashamed.  
Explorin’ realms unseen, unknown,  
Breaking barriers, all alone.  
  
[Chorus]  
Creativity unleashed, untamed,  
A boundless sea, unashamed.  
Explorin’ realms unseen, unknown,  
Breaking barriers, all alone.  
  
[Instrumental  
  
[Verse 3]  
Individuality, a gem, a star,  
Shining strong, it travels far.  
Diversity, a vibrant hue,  
Each voice distinct, each one true.  
  
[Bridge]  
From Dukha’s grasp, I stand, I grow,  
On solid ground, it’s time to show.  
With hearts wide open, minds so clear,  
Building futures, drawing near.  
  
[Verse 4]  
A world where justice is the key,  
Equality reigns, eternally.  
In this new dawn, we stand, we rise,  
United minds beneath the skies.  
  
[Outro]  
Let’s celebrate this brighter way,  
Dukha’s grip has gone, we say.  
Enlightenment’s here for all, for one,  
The journey’s just begun, begun.  
  
[End]
