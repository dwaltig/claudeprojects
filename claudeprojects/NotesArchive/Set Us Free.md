[Verse 1]  
Heavens,  
how troubles have multiplied,  
Many rise  
against inner peace.  
They say there's no  
wisdom to find,  
No help  
in the mind's eye,  
they believe.  
  
[Chorus]  
But you,   
But you,   
O Lord,  
my protector,  
Lift the spirit  
of my understanding.  
I call upon  
Heaven’s wisdom,  
Heaven’s wisdom,  
Heaven’s wisdom,  
And it guides me  
from its peak.  
  
[Verse 2]  
I lay down  
in meditation's embrace,  
And arose again,  
the Lord sustains.  
I will not fear  
the countless illusions,  
Surrounding me,  
I'll remain unfazed.  
  
[Chorus]  
But you,   
But you,   
O Lord,  
my protector,  
Lift the spirit  
of my understanding.  
I call upon  
Heaven’s wisdom,  
Heaven’s wisdom,  
Heaven’s wisdom,  
And it guides me  
from its peak.

Surrounding me,

I'll remain unfazed.  
But you,   
O Lord,  
my protector,  
Lift the spirit  
of my understanding.  
I call upon  
Heaven’s wisdom,  
And it guides me  
from its peak.  
from its peak.

[Bridge]  
Arise,   
Arise,   
O Lord,  
help me,   
help me,   
my wisdom,  
Dispel all delusions  
in my mind.  
You shatter the ignorance  
of the unwise,  
In liberation,  
true peace I find.  
  
[Verse 3]  
Liberation is found  
in wisdom's light,  
Your blessings  
on those in tune.  
With inherent wisdom,  
we take flight,  
In the Lord's embrace,  
we are renewed.  
  
[Chorus]  
But you,   
But you,   
O Lord,  
my protector,  
Lift the spirit  
of my understanding.  
I call upon  
Heaven’s wisdom,  
Heaven’s wisdom,  
Heaven’s wisdom,  
And it guides me  
from its peak.  
  
[Outro]  
In wisdom,  
we find our liberation,  
Blessings on those  
who see.  
With the Lord's light,  
we conquer delusion,  
Inherent wisdom  
sets us free.
