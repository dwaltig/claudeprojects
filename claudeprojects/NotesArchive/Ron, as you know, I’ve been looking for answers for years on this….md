Ron, as you know, I’ve been looking for answers for years on this matter. I thought things were good when Eddie Kimura and I met last year. I was merely being friendly when I texted you. You asked me your questions. I didn't hide anything, then you revealed you knew much more. I was open and honest, I hope you believe in the same response.  
  
Eddie says our connection is karmic. If you were in my position, what would you do? I hope you won't continue to  be so cruel?
