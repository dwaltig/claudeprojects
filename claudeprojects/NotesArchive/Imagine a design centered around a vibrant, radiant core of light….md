Imagine a design centered around a **vibrant, radiant core of light...**. This light represents the **intrinsic, supreme value of life** and the **inherent Buddha nature** within all individuals**...**. It also symbolizes the **Mystic Law** embodied in the Lotus Sutra, which is the source of **absolute happiness** and the **treasures of the heart...**.  
Flowing into, converging upon, and emanating from this central core could be **dynamic lines or shapes**, perhaps in rich, deep colors transitioning to bright ones. These represent the concept of **"namu"** – the **active and single-minded dedication of one's life** to the ultimate truth**...**. The convergence signifies the commitment and integration of one's entire being into the practice.  
The light from the core would then **expand outwards** in waves, ripples, or bursts, illustrating the **manifestation of enlightenment** in this lifetime, the **transformation of one's environment**, and the **altruistic aim of benefiting others through *kosen-rufu*...**. This outward movement conveys the active, engaged, and socially transformative nature of Nichiren Buddhist practice.  
Subtle, perhaps slightly darker or more angular elements could be integrated into the background or within the outward flow, representing the **hardships, opposition, and persecution** encountered in upholding the Dharma**...**. However, these elements would be **overcome, enveloped, or illuminated by the central and expanding light**, symbolizing the transformation of suffering into spiritual growth and the validation of faith through enduring trials. The image avoids showing these darker elements as dominant or defeating.  
In contrast to the central radiance and dynamic flow, areas representing **material wealth or social standing** might be depicted with **less vibrant, more static, or less central elements**, perhaps in muted colors or simpler shapes, highlighting their transient nature compared to the eternal value of the "treasures of the heart"**...**.  
Overall, the image would be non-representational, using light, color gradients, textures, and abstract forms to convey the essay's core message: that the most profound offering one can make is one's life dedicated to the highest truth, leading to inner transformation and actively working for the happiness of others and society.
