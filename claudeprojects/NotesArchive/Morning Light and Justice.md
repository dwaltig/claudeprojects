# Morning Light and Justice  
# Morning Light and Justice  
  
Verse 1:  
In the quiet of the dawn, I raise my voice,  
Seeking guidance, in this world of noise,  
I lift my eyes to the morning sky,  
For in your presence, I cannot lie.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, morning light, lead me through,  
In your justice, I find what’s true,  
Protect me from the wicked’s way,  
In your love, I choose to stay.  
  
Verse 2:  
The righteous walk, a path so clear,  
With your favor, I have no fear,  
Shield me with your endless grace,  
In your shelter, I find my place.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, morning light, lead me through,  
In your justice, I find what’s true,  
Protect me from the wicked’s way,  
In your love, I choose to stay.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
Bridge:  
The wicked fall, their lies exposed,  
In your truth, their path is closed,  
But in your light, I find my peace,  
With your love, my doubts release.  
  
Verse 3:  
As the sun rises, so does my hope,  
In your guidance, I learn to cope,  
Morning prayers, my heart’s desire,  
In your justice, I find my fire.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, morning light, lead me through,  
In your justice, I find what’s true,  
Protect me from the wicked’s way,  
In your love, I choose to stay.  
  
Outro:  
With every dawn, I sing this song,  
In your light, I know I belong,  
Morning light, my guiding star,  
In your love, I find who we are.  
  
[Instrumental]
