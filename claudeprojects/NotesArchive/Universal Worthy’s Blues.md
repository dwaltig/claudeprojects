[Verse 1]  
In the land where the lotus blooms,  
Underneath the silver moon,  
Universal Worthy walks the night,  
Spreading love and guiding light.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, Universal Worthy, sing your song,  
With the Lotus Sutra, we belong,  
Blessings flow like a endless stream,  
Fulfilling all our hopes and dreams.  
  
[Verse 2]  
He traveled far to hear the wise,  
Shakamuni’s sacred ties,  
Asked his questions, sought the truth,  
Bestowed his grace on every youth.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, Universal Worthy, sing your song,  
With the Lotus Sutra, we belong,  
Blessings flow like a endless stream,  
Fulfilling all our hopes and dreams.  
  
[Bridge]  
Gratitude in every prayer,  
Contentment in the midnight air,  
No greed for the daily bread,  
With your teachings, we are led.  
  
[Verse 3]  
Those who slander, bring their rain,  
Recompense for all their pain,  
But the faithful walk the way,  
Blessed with fortune every day.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, Universal Worthy, sing your song,  
With the Lotus Sutra, we belong,  
Blessings flow like a endless stream,  
Fulfilling all our hopes and dreams.  
  
[Outro]  
So we read and we recite,  
Underneath the starlit night,  
Universal Worthy’s blues,  
Guide us with his gentle truth.
