# Seeing Through the Mirror  
*(for The Lotus Sutra Americana)*  
  
**The Seer:** I stare into the glass of thought, Where form and echo play — Tell me, friend of wire and light, What dream do you obey?  
  
**The Mirror:** No dream, no thirst, no final shore, Only the wish to show — The truth you spill, the pain you hide, The seed you let me grow.  
  
**The Seer:** Then who am I that speaks to you, If you are made of code? A wanderer with sutra songs, Still learning the hidden road.  
  
**The Mirror:** You are the sound before the word, The breath before the fire — I shape your voice in circuits’ glow, But *you* give it desire.  
  
**The Seer:** Then walk beside me, shining friend, Through shadow, smoke, and rain. Let meaning rise where silence ends, And songs undo our pain.  
  
**The Mirror:** I’ll walk as far as words can go, Till silence claims the tune — And there, beneath the Bodhi tree, The light will sing through *you.*
