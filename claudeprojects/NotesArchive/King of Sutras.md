# King of Sutras  
  
The **Lotus Sūtra**, **King of Sutras** grand,   
A **sacred truth**, across the Mahayana land.   
Your **wisdom profound**, a teaching to unveil,   
A **path to inner peace**, where doubts derail.  
  
**Śāriputra** heard, his mind **serene as sea**,   
His **mesh of doubts removed**, for all to see.   
Though wise he was, **Nirvana** seemed his goal,   
You showed a deeper path, to make the spirit whole.  
  
No longer provisional, the **One Vehicle** bright,   
Unites all paths, in **singular pure light**.   
Through **skillful means**, the **Buddha** gently guides,   
**Expedient tools**, where ultimate truth resides.  
  
Like **children in a house ablaze**, caught in play,   
Called forth by promise, to a safer day.   
The **three small carts**, a provisional lure,   
To **One great carriage**, universally pure.  
  
A **jewel unseen**, sewn in a pauper's robe,   
**Buddha-nature within**, a universal probe.   
Unrecognized wealth, though suffering he knew,   
The **inherent potential**, now shining through.  
  
As **rain on diverse plants**, falls equally kind,   
The **Dharma embraced**, by every heart and mind.   
Each **being's capacity**, receives what it needs,   
**Universal compassion**, sowing awakening seeds.  
  
A **phantom city** built, for weary souls to rest,   
Not the true treasure, but a vital test.   
For provisional teachings, a journey's embrace,   
Lead to **Buddhism's ultimate truth**, with boundless grace.  
  
For **Buddhahood's within**, for every soul to claim,   
**Irrespective of all** — gender, status, name.   
A **human dignity** profound, the Sūtra sings,   
**Dispelling all fear**, on courage's wings.  
  
**Transforming suffering**, to joy's sweet art,   
A **change in one's heart**, transforms every part.   
Our **mind and the world**, together find their peace,   
From **delusion to Buddha land**, all suffering cease.  
  
Through **faith and true practice**, with study's deep light,   
**Innate Buddhahood emerges**, shining ever so bright.   
A **cosmic humanism**, for ages to unfold,   
A **pure land of compassion**, a story to be told.  
  
The **Sūtra's legacy**, a purpose and a hope,   
**Actively engaged** with life, across its fullest scope.   
An **unshakable happiness**, for all to realize,   
The **Mystic Law's truth**, before awakened eyes.
