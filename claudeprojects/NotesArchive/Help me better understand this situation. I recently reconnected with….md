**Help me better understand this situation. I recently reconnected with a friend after a few months. When we last spoke, our interests had diverged. This isn’t an isolated incident; it’s happened multiple times. For example, we’d talk in the park near my house, and then months or weeks would pass without seeing each other again. The last time I did this was when I bought a six-pack and took it to his house. Despite these inconsistencies, I genuinely want to be friends with him. However, he recently expressed his desire to spend time with me and even suggested booking a hotel together. He seems like a valuable addition to my life, and I believe he’s a gift from above. **
