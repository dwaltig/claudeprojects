Thank you Adunni. I received your invitation.  
I have to tell you, Many of my friends, including myself, have personally experienced similar testimonies/faith transforming experiences and greater in our lives because of our spiritual practice. Certainly, your community can enrich mine.  
I would love to hear your story, and hopefully, you'll be patient enough to hear mine.   
My practice teaches me,  as human beings, we have the potential for immeasurable compassion, unlimited eloquence, power, fearlessness, concentration, emancipation, and samadhis (profound calm insights or Divine Union), deeply entering the boundless and Awakening to the Truth never before attained.   
As more of us awaken to our God-given potential, we are commissioned to share this divine wisdom, encouraging others to exercise their innate transformative-faith thus building a culture of World Peace.
