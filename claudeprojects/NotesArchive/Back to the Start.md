# Back to the Start  
  
*With the passage of time, it is commonplace for freshness of spirit to fade and for apathy and inertia to set in. When that happens, new growth and development cease. The way to overcome apathy is to return to one’s starting point.*  
*—Daisaku Ikeda*  
[The New Human Revolution*, Vol. 23, “The Future” chapter*]  
  
One key teaching in the *Lotus Sutra* is the idea of “eternal Buddha-nature” within all beings. Even when we feel lost, apathetic, or stuck in our own inertia, our innate potential for enlightenment remains unchanged. The Sutra encourages practitioners to return to this inner source of wisdom, or “starting point.” This is symbolized in the stories of disciples and bodhisattvas who face challenges but, through perseverance and a return to their original faith and determination, attain Buddhahood.  
  
Furthermore, in Chapter 3, the *Parable of the Burning House*, the father (representing the Buddha) draws his children away from danger (symbolizing ignorance and apathy) by reminding them of their greater potential and destiny. Similarly, Ikeda’s message highlights that when we lose our way, returning to our original inspiration can help reignite our passion and growth, just as the children in the parable are drawn back to safety and wisdom.  
  
  
**[Verse 1]**  
Days drift by, and spirits fade   
Our roots are still, no growth to show   
In our minds, we start to wade   
Through doubt and fear we’ve come to know   
  
**[Verse 2]**  
Wading through this endless time   
To rise above this dull embrace   
Inertia holds us in its climb   
A mountain we must surely face   
  
**[Chorus]**  
To find the strength we knew before   
Revive the spark, let’s heal the heart   
Rekindle hope, chase what’s in store   
The journey takes us back to start   
  
**[Verse 3]**  
We’ve walked this road far too long   
Forgot the joy that life can give   
The wind that used to make us strong   
Reminds us now that we must live   
  
**[Bridge]**  
Shake off the dust, break every chain   
Step forward now, we won’t look back   
Rediscover joy, forget the pain   
And set ourselves back on track   
  
**[Chorus]**  
To find the strength we knew before   
Revive the spark, let’s heal the heart   
Rekindle hope, chase what’s in store   
The journey takes us back to start   
  
Reprise:
