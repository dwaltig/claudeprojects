# Distant Moon  
  
*(Ethereal and introspective)*  
  
**[Verse 1]**  
Distant moon, what do you know?  
You hang so high, your silver glow.  
Do you see the tears we hide,  
Or the dreams we cast aside?  
  
From your throne of endless night,  
Do you guard the secrets of our plight?  
Or do you drift, untouched, unknown,  
Forever silent, always alone?  
  
**[Chorus]**  
Distant moon, tell me your tale,  
Of whispers caught on a fleeting gale.  
Do you hear the songs of the earth below,  
Or carry the weight of what we’ll never show?  
Distant moon, your quiet stare,  
Holds mysteries floating in the air.  
  
**[Verse 2]**  
Do you remember the ancient cries,  
The love that wanes, the heart that dies?  
Do you keep the echoes near,  
The fragile hopes, the whispered fears?  
  
You light the path for those who roam,  
Yet you’re a wanderer far from home.  
Do you long for a touch, a voice,  
Or is your silence your only choice?  
  
**[Chorus]**  
Distant moon, tell me your tale,  
Of whispers caught on a fleeting gale.  
Do you hear the songs of the earth below,  
Or carry the weight of what we’ll never show?  
Distant moon, your quiet stare,  
Holds mysteries floating in the air.  
  
**[Bridge]**  
What lies behind your glowing face?  
A heart of stone, or endless space?  
Do you ache for the world you see,  
Or are you content in your mystery?  
  
**[Final Chorus]**  
Distant moon, what do you know?  
Do you watch as our sorrows grow?  
Guide us with your steady light,  
Through the endless, restless night.  
Distant moon, forever apart,  
A cold reflection of our hearts.  
  
**[Outro]**  
Distant moon, you’ll always be,  
A silent witness to our eternity.  
What do you know, so far, so high?  
A glowing question in the sky.  
  
This version aims to deepen the song’s emotional resonance and highlight the moon’s role as a mysterious and eternal observer of humanity. Let me know if you’d like further tweaks!
