These song ideas draw heavily on the themes of **hidden potential, forgotten duty, and ultimate spiritual destiny** found in the excerpts concerning Rāhula and Bodhisattva vows [1].  
  
Here is a detailed elaboration of ideas 1, 3, and 4, connecting them directly to the source material for bluesy folk lyrical development:  
  
### 1. The Secret Vow (The Forgotten Promise)  
  
This concept focuses on the profound loss of purpose when the Bodhisattva vow is forgotten [1].  
  
*   **Lyrical Focus:** The song would lament the feeling of having a vital mission but being unable to recall it. It centers on the burden of a secret that the singer carries, which is actually a commitment to "come into this world of conflict to benefit all beings" [1].  
*   **Source Connection:** This idea is supported by the teaching that due to the "preoccupations that come with this life," individuals "can forget these vows" [1]. When forgotten, the vow "become[s] a secret even to us" [1].  
*   **Blues/Folk Angle:** The musical structure would suit a heavy, introspective blues tune. The singer is feeling lost and preoccupied, struggling against the current of daily life while sensing a forgotten, higher duty that haunts their steps. The climax of the song could be the moment of realization, recognizing that they must step back onto the path to fulfill this ancient promise [1].  
  
### 3. Rāhula's Guise (The Hidden Truth)  
  
This idea is built around the dramatic tension between outward appearance and inward, high-level spiritual practice [1].  
  
*   **Lyrical Focus:** The song is sung from the perspective of an observer or teacher (like the Buddha) who sees a loved one—the "eldest son" figure—living an apparently ordinary life [1]. The observer knows the truth: this person is maintaining powerful "secret practices" [1].  
*   **Source Connection:** The core lyrics draw directly from the verses: "**He shows himself / To all living beings / In the form of my eldest son**" [1]. The underlying tension is that "Only I know his secret practices" [1].  
*   **Blues/Folk Angle:** This is an excellent concept for a storytelling folk ballad or a slow, brooding blues narrative. The narrative highlights the profound effort required to conceal ultimate practice while engaging with the mundane world. The song explores the mystery of why one would choose to appear so plain while possessing such high spiritual aims [1].  
  
### 4. The Inheritance  
  
This concept captures the journey from ignorance to triumphant realization upon hearing the Sūtra's teaching [1].  
  
*   **Lyrical Focus:** The song begins with the singer feeling like an orphan or someone with no title, struggling to find a place in the "world of conflict" [1]. The tone shifts dramatically upon receiving the teaching, realizing that they are "dear children of the Dharma" [1] and are entitled to the ultimate spiritual possession.  
*   **Source Connection:** This is based on the powerful reminder that when we hear the Sūtra, we realize that **"enlightenment is our rightful inheritance"** [1].  
*   **Blues/Folk Angle:** This could start as a mournful folk song about struggle, resolving into a determined, acoustic folk-rock anthem. The key emotional shift is moving from feeling undeserving or preoccupied to stepping up to claim this "rightful inheritance" [1]—the freedom and peace represented by enlightenment. It focuses on the hope and affirmation that the ultimate goal is not earned, but remembered and claimed [1].
