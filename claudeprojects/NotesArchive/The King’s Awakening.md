# The King’s Awakening  
  
"✨ The King’s Awakening ✨ is a soul-stirring folk song inspired by Chapter 27 of the Lotus Sutra, brought to life by the haunting, longing voice of Dionysus. Retelling the journey of King Subhavyūha, Queen Vimaladattā, and their sons, Princes Vimalagarbha and Vimalanetra, this ballad weaves a tale of spiritual transformation, from worldly illusion to the eternal light of the Dharma. Steel-string guitars twang with raw, earthy tension, while a swelling organ lifts the melody into an ecstatic, sacred realm, enhancing Dionysus’s wild yet tender delivery. The song’s vivid verses and hypnotic chorus—echoing the rarity of wisdom’s bloom—culminate in a frenzied renunciation and a promise of ever-present awakening, blending folk simplicity with divine fervor."

Lyrics:   
(Verse 1 – The King’s Illusion of Power)  
A king once ruled with golden hands,  
His wealth spread wide across the lands.  
Yet whispers rose from halls of stone,  
Two sons who saw beyond the throne.  
  
(Verse 2 – The Princes’ Plea to Their Mother)  
“Mother, grant us leave to seek,  
A path where worldly ties are weak.  
No crown nor gold can set hearts free,  
But wisdom’s light eternally.”  
  
(Chorus – The Rarity of True Wisdom)  
Oh, rare as the fig tree’s bloom,  
Or the tortoise that threads the loom,  
The truth appears but once in time,  
A voice resounds—profound, divine.  
  
(Verse 3 – The Sons’ Teaching to Their Father)  
“Father, listen, lift your gaze,  
The Lotus shines in endless ways.  
Not in temples, gold, or might,  
But in the Dharma’s sacred light.”  
  
(Verse 4 – The King’s Doubt and Realization)  
The king stood firm, his heart held fast,  
Yet doubts like shadows would not last.  
“My sons, my masters, now I see,  
You've led my soul to clarity.”  
  
(Chorus – The Rarity of True Wisdom)  
Oh, rare as the fig tree’s bloom,  
Or the tortoise that threads the loom,  
The truth appears but once in time,  
A voice resounds—profound, divine.  
  
(Bridge – The Renunciation and the Pull of the Lotus Sutra)  
Forty-two thousand took the vow,  
Cast aside their burdens now.  
The queen, the court, all felt the call,  
The Lotus Sutra claimed them all.  
  
(Verse 5 – The Path of Meditation and Enlightenment)  
Vimalagarbha knelt in grace,  
To clear all beings’ dark embrace.  
While Subhavyūha, lost no more,  
Found virtues vast—a boundless shore.  
  
(Final Chorus – The Awakening of All)  
Oh, rare as the fig tree’s bloom,  
Or the tortoise that threads the loom,  
The truth appears but once in time,  
A voice resounds—profound, divine.  
  
(Outro – The Eternal Dharma’s Light)  
From palace halls to mountain high,  
The Dharma never fades nor dies.  
For all who hear and choose to see,  
The Lotus shines eternally.
