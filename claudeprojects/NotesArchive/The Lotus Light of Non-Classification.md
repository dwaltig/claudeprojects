## The Lotus Light of Non-Classification  
  
Beyond the walls of what is fixed and named,   
The **Bodhisattva** finds the quiet path.   
No "superior" or "inferior" is proclaimed,   
No vehicle to stoke the ego’s wrath.  
  
The ultimate truth is **Ekayāna’s** Single Flow,   
Where doctrines are but skillful, timely tools,   
And sectarian pride is simply seen to grow   
From clinging to the provisional, and not the rules.  
  
The *Vihāra* is not outward quietude alone,   
But wisdom’s deep, **epistemological** light.  
The categories that the grasping mind has sown—   
Like "real and unreal"—dissolve in endless sight.  
  
For **Śūnyatā** reveals all things lack core,   
No essence to be clung to or dismissed.  
**Samsāra** and **Nirvāṇa** meet upon the shore;   
The conditioned world is where the path is kissed.  
  
"Not man," "not woman"—these are empty forms.  
**Anātman** sees no fixed, inherent worth.  
The illusion of the self that rages in the storms   
Is seen as but an aggregation from the earth.  
  
**Dependent Origination** shows the ceaseless chain,   
Where feeling flares before the thirst begins.  
The **peaceful conduct** breaks the link of pain,   
Where non-reaction frees the mind from sins.  
  
The sage does not obtain, nor know, nor see,  
In grasping ways that build a world of "mine."   
**Non-clinging** sets the troubled spirit free,   
An **Equanimity** that makes the heart divine.  
  
The impulse to **dominate** is overthrown,   
Replaced by curiosity and tender care.  
The Dharma is taught, the seed of wisdom sown,   
Without desire for outcome, or despair.  
  
To dwell in peace is to embrace the whole,   
To operate with purity in the causal stream.  
Non-judgment is the purpose, and the soul   
Of **Padmaprabha’s** compassionate, unfolding dream.
