Lyrics   
[Verse 1] In a land where muses roam, (Ooh, yeah!) Angels hum their tune, Wisdom flows like a river, Beneath a silver moon.  
  
[Chorus] Oh, that sweet dream of angels, Where every soul is free, We soar on wings of passion, In love’s true harmony.  
  
[Verse 2] Mountains full of fire, Risin’ tall and strong, Valleys rich with knowledge, Where every heart belongs.  
  
[Chorus] Oh, that sweet dream of angels, Where every soul is free, We soar on wings of passion, In love’s true harmony.  
  
[Bridge] Oh, in that garden of grace, Where souls bloom and shine, Every moment a treasure, Love’s endless, pure design.  
  
[Verse 3] With compassion as the thread, Of this high and holy place, We bloom like wildflowers, In the garden of grace.  
  
[Chorus] Oh, that sweet dream of angels, Where every soul is free, We soar on wings of passion, In love’s true harmony.  
  
No more than passion  
No more than passion  
No more than passion
