# We All Running Out of Time.   
  
[Verse 1]  
I used to carry grudges like a second set of keys  
Kept 'em in my pocket, polished them with memories  
Every name that wronged me, every hand that did me dirty  
Had a file in my heart that I updated past thirty  
  
[Chorus]  
But we all running out of time  
Every tick of the clock is yours and mine  
Why you gonna waste it holding on to hate?  
We all running out of time, don't let it be too late  
  
[Verse 2]  
Fire don't put out fire, that's the oldest law there is  
My grandmama told me that, and her grandmother told her kids  
You want the burning to stop? You gotta bring something different  
Non-hate for the hatred, that's the healing, that's the treatment  
  
[Chorus]  
We all running out of time  
Every tick of the clock is yours and mine  
Why you gonna waste it holding on to hate?  
We all running out of time, don't let it be too late  
  
[Bridge]  
Look around this room, every soul is headed home  
Could be tomorrow, could be tonight, nobody knows  
So what you fighting for? What grudge is worth your breath?  
Let it go, let it go, we're all just walking toward death  
  
[Verse 3]  
Wise ones figured this out, they don't bother with the brawl  
When you know the clock is ticking, you stop sweating the small  
Put your sword down, brother, sister, lay your burdens on the ground  
This old world's too beautiful to miss while you're angry at the sound  
  
[Final Chorus]  
We all running out of time  
Every tick of the clock is yours and mine  
Don't you wanna feel that peace before you go?  
We all running out of time, let the hatred flow  
  
[Outro]  
Here's my loving trick for you tonight:  
Stop fighting fire with fire—it only burns the house down.  
Meet hate with something softer, something wiser.  
Your time is precious, baby. Don't waste it being angry.  
We running out of time... so love while you can.
