Lyrics:  
(Verse 1)  
Woke up this mornin', soul feelin' low  
Same old troubles, nowhere to go  
Heard a whisper, on the wind so sweet  
Sayin', "Boy, you searchin', for somethin' deep?"  
  
(Verse 2)  
Buddha's words, like a beacon in the night  
Shinin' a path, under pale moonlight  
Gotta have faith, gotta trust the way  
Even when shadows, try to lead astray  
  
(Chorus)  
This ain't no easy road, this soul's gotta learn  
Gotta question everything, at every turn  
Open your heart, let the truth shine in  
Wash away the darkness, let the healin' begin  
  
(Verse 3)  
Sāriputta knew the way, clear and bright  
Asked the questions, brought 'em to light  
Ain't no shame in seekin', knockin' on that door  
'Til the answers open, can’t ignore no more  
  
(Verse 4)  
Mind's a tangled web, spun with doubt and fear  
But the Dharma’s whisper cuts through clear  
Embrace the challenge, let go of the past  
Truth’s a deep river, flowin’ free and fast  
  
(Chorus)  
This ain't no easy road, this soul's gotta learn  
Gotta question everything, at every turn  
Open your heart, let the truth shine in  
Wash away the darkness, let the healin' begin  
  
(Verse 5 - Impermanence)  
These blues keep comin', but they don't stay long  
Like a river flowin', they move along  
I hold on too tight, but they slip away  
Findin' peace in knowin', they ain’t here to stay  
  
(Verse 6 - No-Self)  
Thought I was somethin', just flesh and bone  
But the Dharma taught me, I ain’t alone  
No self to cling to, no cage to hold  
Just a soul walkin', searchin’ for that gold  
  
(Chorus)  
This ain't no easy road, this soul’s gotta learn  
Gotta question everything, at every turn  
Open your heart, let the truth shine in  
Wash away the darkness, let the healin' begin  
  
(Bridge - Reflection)  
Now I’m sittin’ steady, breathin' it all in  
Through right view, the freedom, let it begin  
This truth is my home, this love, my friend  
  
(Guitar Solo - soulful and expressive)  
  
(Chorus)  
This ain't no easy road, this soul’s gotta learn  
Gotta question everything, at every turn  
Open your heart, let the truth shine in  
Wash away the darkness, let the healin' begin  
  
(Outro)  
Oh, this ain't no easy road...  
But I’m walkin' it slow...  
(Fade out with slide guitar)  
  
[End]
