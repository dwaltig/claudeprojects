# Your Love, My Faith  
  
Verse 1  
I’ve walked through the fire, I’ve weathered the storm,  
Tried to do right, tried to keep warm.  
Gave all I had, practiced what’s true,  
But nothing compares to the faith I found in you.  
  
Chorus  
Oh, just a moment of trust, it’s all I need,  
A spark in the stillness, your heart’s where I’m freed.  
Your love’s like forever, it’s a truth so divine,  
One moment of trust, and the stars align.  
  
Verse 2  
I’ve given my time, I’ve paid my dues,  
Chased after wisdom, walked through the blues.  
But the *power* of faith, it outshines the rest,  
One moment of trust, and I’m truly blessed.  
  
Chorus  
Oh, just a moment of trust, it’s all I need,  
A spark in the stillness, your heart’s where I’m freed.  
Your love’s like forever, it’s a truth so divine,  
One moment of trust, and the stars align.  
  
Bridge  
Doubt and fear, they try to take hold,  
But your love’s a fire that never grows cold.  
Through endless cycles, I’ll find my way,  
With faith in your heart, I’ll see the day.  
  
Outro  
So I’ll sit on the mountain, and I’ll roar like a lion,  
With your love as my guide, and hope my Zion.  
One moment of trust, and the path is clear,  
The virtue of faith, it’s always near.
