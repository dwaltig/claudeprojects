# Lion’s Roar  
  
Embark on a spiritual journey with “the Lion’s Roar,” a song born from reflection on our challenging modern era – the age of Mappō. This track delves into the heart of Nichiren's teachings, exploring the profound path to enlightenment and the unwavering strength found within the Lotus Sutra.  
  
Follow a lyrical narrative of seeking ultimate truth amidst life's trials and doctrinal confusion. Discover the transformative power of chanting Myoho Renge Kyo, a practice that can illuminate the darkness and help unlock your inherent Buddha-nature, just as Nichiren taught. This song is a heartfelt echo of the Votary's courage and a beacon of hope in a world yearning for clarity.  
  
From William Altig (Padmaprabha), this offering blends storytelling with the universal quest for wisdom, compassion, and personal growth. It's an invitation to connect with the Mystic Law and find your own peace on consecrated ground.

Lyrics:   
(Verse 1) Woke up this mornin', feelin' weary and low, Trouble on the mountain, chaos down below. This age of Mappō, got my spirit worn and thin, Gotta find the true path, gotta know where to begin.  
  
(Verse 2) See the common folk bowin' to the samurai's hard hand, Break the ruler's law, you might lose your place and land. Nichiren wrote a letter, sent it 'cross the miles, Said that worldly justice ain't the end of all our trials.  
  
**(Chorus)** **Hear the lion's roar, Nichiren's mighty sound!** **The Lotus is the Law, on consecrated ground.** **Chant Myoho Renge Kyo, let the truth arise!** **Unlock your Wonderful-nature, right before your eyes.**  
  
(Verse 3) Hear 'em preachin' 'bout the Pure Land, chantin' Amida's name, Some say Zen reflection gonna soothe away life's flame. But if you place those teachings provisional above the rest, You're turnin' from the Lotus, failin' the ultimate test.  
  
(Verse 4) He said that's slanderin' the Dharma, a heavy, heavy sin, Worse than killin' parents, or where deep schisms begin. Like a great fire burnin', scorchin' all you've known, To Avīci Hell you're fallin', swiftly as an arrow's flown.  
  
**(Chorus)** **Hear the lion's roar, Nichiren's mighty sound!** **The Lotus is the Law, on consecrated ground.** **Chant  Myoho Renge Kyo, let the truth arise!** **Unlock your Wonderful-nature, right before your eyes.**  
  
(Bridge) But there's a jewel shinin', with the power to save, The Buddha's highest truth, for this challenging age, so brave. It's the Lotus Sutra callin', the One Vehicle's sound, Enlightenment for all beings, on this hallowed ground.  
  
(Verse 6) He faced down persecution, exiled on that lonely isle, Said the Votary's path ain't easy, gotta walk it for a while. Holdin' up the Mystic Law, that's the truth he made so clear, Myoho Renge Kyo, banishin' all doubt and fear.  
  
**(Chorus)** **Hear the lion's roar, Nichiren's mighty sound!** **The Lotus is the Law, on consecrated ground.** **Chant Myoho Renge Kyo, let the truth arise!** **Unlock your Wonderful-nature, right before your eyes.**  
  
(Outro) Yeah, the world keeps turnin', got different paths today. Still gotta face that question, still gotta find the way. Is it strict condemnation, or dialogue and grace?.... Walkin' that Lotus road, seekin' peace in every place.... Lord, seekin' peace in every place...
