A painting divided into two major halves, reflecting the dualities of inner and outer worlds. On the left side, envision a meditating figure bathed in rich hues of indigo and gold, symbolizing wisdom and compassion. The figure would be seated in a meditative posture, eyes closed but smiling gently, embodying internal tranquility.

Around this figure, translucent bubbles could float upward, each containing an iconic symbol: a feather for lightness and clarity, a flame for transformative power, and a lotus for purity and enlightenment. These bubbles would gradually rise and morph into birds, signifying the freeing of the mind from earthly tethers.  
  
The right half of the painting would contrastingly be a vivid tapestry of the everyday world: people, animals, trees, and even celestial bodies. Here, splashes of vibrant colors—greens, reds, and blues—would depict life in all its complexity. Yet, all elements in this half would be oriented toward the meditating figure, as if being drawn toward it, signifying the gravitational pull of enlightened wisdom.  
  
Where the two halves meet, a cascade of golden light would emanate from the heart of the meditating figure, illuminating and harmonizing the contrasting worlds. This light would also scatter into countless smaller beams that extend out beyond the frame, inviting the viewer to consider their own place in this continuum of wisdom and worldly experience.

Stage 2 Questions  
  
	1.	Emotion, Style, and Aesthetic: Given the thematic richness of your concept, what emotions or moods are you looking to evoke? And stylistically, are you leaning toward a more classical painting technique like oil on canvas, or something more contemporary like digital art?  
	2.	Key Elements and Context: You’ve beautifully outlined the major elements. Are there any finer details you’d like to add, such as facial expressions of the people in the ‘outer world,’ or specific types of trees or animals? How do they interact or look toward the meditating figure?  
	3.	Environment, Perspective, and Movement: You spoke of a cascade of golden light and rising bubbles morphing into birds. Could you describe how you’d like the perspective to capture this movement? Is the viewer at eye-level with the meditating figure or looking from above or below?  
  
Your Generated Prompt  
  
	Create a divided painting featuring a meditating figure on the left bathed in indigo and gold, surrounded by rising bubbles containing a feather, flame, and lotus, which morph into birds. On the right, display a vivid tapestry of the everyday world in vibrant colors, all elements oriented toward the meditating figure. At the meeting point, a cascade of golden light emanates from the figure’s heart, harmonizing both worlds and extending beyond the frame. The art style is yet to be determined, the mood is tranquil yet complex, and the perspective is undefined.
