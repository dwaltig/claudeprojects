[Intro]  
  
Verse 1:  
In the deep sea waters,   
In the deep sea waters,   
In the deep sea waters,   
where the dragons roam,  
A young girl stood,   
far from her home.  
They said she couldn’t,   
no way she’d see,  
The light of truth,   
the Buddha’s decree.  
  
Chorus:  
But actions speak louder than words,   
oh, they do,  
She showed the world   
what’s deep and true.  
With a heart of gold   
and a priceless gem,  
She found the light,   
and she showed it to them.  
  
Verse 2:  
Mañjuśrī knew,   
she had the grace,  
But the wise ones doubted,   
they couldn’t embrace.  
How could a child,   
just eight years old,  
Hold the key to wisdom’s fold?  
  
Chorus:  
But actions speak louder than words,   
oh, they do,  
She showed the world   
what’s deep and true.  
With a heart of gold   
and a priceless gem,  
She found the light,   
and she showed it to them.  
and she showed it to them.  
  
Reprise Verse 2: Mañjuśrī knew, she had the grace, But the wise ones doubted, they couldn’t embrace. How could a child, just eight years old, Hold the key to wisdom’s fold?

[Instrumental]  
  
Bridge:  
She offered her gem,   
with reverence so bright,  
And in that moment,   
she found her light.  
Transformed before their very eyes,  
She rose above,   
touched the skies.  
  
Verse 3:  
Now the world shook,   
the truth was clear,  
No more doubt, no more fear.  
The Dragon King’s daughter,   
so pure, so wise,  
Reached enlightenment,   
to everyone’s surprise.  
  
Chorus:  
Because actions speak louder than words,  
 oh, they do,  
She showed the world   
what’s deep and true.  
With a heart of gold   
and a priceless gem,  
She found the light,   
and she showed it to them.  
  
Outro:  
So when you’re doubted,   
when you’re told you can’t,  
Remember her story,   
take a stand.  
For actions speak louder,   
yes, it’s true,  
Just like that girl,   
the Buddha in you.  
the Buddha in you.
