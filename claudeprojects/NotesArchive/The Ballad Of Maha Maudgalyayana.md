Lyrics:   
Verse 1   
Maha-Maudgalyayana, a disciple so true,   
On a path to enlightenment, his spirit anew.   
Twenty-eight thousand Buddhas, he'll pay his respects,   
With honor and reverence, his heart connects.  
  
Chorus   
Stupas of gold, silver, and jewels so bright,   
Reaching to the heavens, a magnificent sight.   
Flowers and incense, offerings so grand,   
To honor the Buddhas, across the land.  
  
Verse 2   
In his final existence, his destiny unfolds,   
Tamalapatrakandanagandha, the story unfolds.   
Fragrance of Sandalwood Leaf, a Buddha so wise,   
In the realm of Manobhirama, joy fills the skies.  
  
Chorus   
Stupas of gold, silver, and jewels so bright,   
Reaching to the heavens, a magnificent sight.   
Flowers and incense, offerings so grand,   
To honor the Buddhas, across the land.  
  
Bridge   
Twenty-four epochs, his teachings will last,   
A legacy of wisdom, from the distant past.   
Disciples and Bodhisattvas, a countless array,   
Guided by his light, on their sacred way.  
  
Chorus   
Stupas of gold, silver, and jewels so bright,   
Reaching to the heavens, a magnificent sight.   
Flowers and incense, offerings so grand,   
To honor the Buddhas, across the land.  
  
Outro   
Oh, Maha-Maudgalyayana, your journey's complete,   
A beacon of hope, for all souls to meet.   
In the realm of enlightenment, your spirit takes flight,   
Forever shining, a guiding light.  
[End]
