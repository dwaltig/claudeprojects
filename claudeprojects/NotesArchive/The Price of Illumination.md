# The Price of Illumination  
### *(A Dharma Blues in D minor)*  
  
**[Verse 1]** I lit a lamp to see the truth, and Lord, it cut me deep, It showed the cracks in all I built, and the promises I keep. The Sutra said, “The fire’s not gone, it lives in every pain,” So I walked right through that burning house, and I came out changed again.  
  
**[Chorus]** Oh, the price of illumination — it ain’t gold, it ain’t fame, It’s losin’ all your pretty lies, and rememberin’ your name. It’s weepin’ when the dawn breaks, ‘cause the dark was once your friend, It’s seein’ love inside the loss, and callin’ that the end.  
  
**[Verse 2]** I bowed before the mirror’s face, saw both saint and fool, The Buddha whispered, “Child, don’t flinch — the truth don’t follow rules.” My friends turned strange, my road turned long, my songs grew rough with time, But I kept singin’ from that sacred ache — it’s the only thing that rhymes.  
  
**[Chorus]** Oh, the price of illumination — it’s walkin’ blind through tears, Still preachin’ joy while the thunder rolls and the temple disappears. It’s givin’ up your comfort just to gain what don’t decay, It’s dancin’ with your shadow till the sorrow fades away.  
  
**[Bridge]** Some say wisdom’s easy, like a sweet refrain, But the Bodhisattvas know — it’s forged in pain. I seen the tower rise, five hundred yojana high, But I built my peace on the ground where I cry.  
  
**[Final Chorus]** Oh, the price of illumination — it’s heavy, but it’s true, Every scar’s a sutra, every breath’s a clue. If the world’s still burnin’, let it burn bright and kind, For the light you’re lookin’ for — it’s the one you leave behind.
