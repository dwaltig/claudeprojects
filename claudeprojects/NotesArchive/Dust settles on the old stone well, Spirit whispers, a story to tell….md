Dust settles on the old stone well, Spirit whispers, a story to tell. Asked the question, heart full of plea, But the answer came back, a shadow on me.  
 A pit in the ground, a shadow descends, Decay is creepin', where hope often ends. Bound by the water, lost in the foam, Gotta break these chains, to find my way home.  
  
Took on too much, a tangled vine, Lost my direction, lost my shine. Tried to hold on, to everything I knew, But the roots were rotten, and the branches untrue.  
  
A pit in the ground, a shadow descends, Decay is creepin', where hope often ends. Bound by the water, lost in the foam, Gotta break these chains, to find my way home.  
  
Spirit's callin', a whisperin' breeze, Let go of the burden, find your ease. Prune the garden, let the sunlight through, A new bloom risin', honest and true.  
  
Yeah, gotta break these chains… find my way home…
