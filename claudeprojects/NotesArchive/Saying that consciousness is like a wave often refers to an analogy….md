Saying that consciousness is like a wave often refers to an analogy used to describe certain theories of consciousness, particularly those influenced by quantum mechanics. This analogy is rooted in the dual wave-particle nature of quantum entities, as described in quantum theory. Here's what the analogy implies:  
  
1. **Quantum Superposition and Consciousness**: In quantum mechanics, particles exist in a state of superposition, meaning they can be in multiple states or places simultaneously until they are observed. This wave-like behavior (where the particle is described by a probability wave) is contrasted with the particle-like behavior upon observation (where the particle assumes a definite position or state). Analogously, some theories suggest consciousness could operate in a similar superposition, with multiple potential states or experiences that collapse to a single state upon observation or experience.  
  
2. **Non-locality and Connectedness**: Quantum theory also introduces the concept of entanglement, where particles remain connected (no matter the distance) such that the state of one instantly influences the other. In the context of consciousness, this could metaphorically suggest a type of interconnectedness of conscious experiences or a non-local aspect of consciousness.  
  
3. **Flow and Change**: Describing consciousness as a wave may also be metaphorical for its continuous flow and change. Just as a wave is a dynamic, ever-changing process, consciousness too is fluid and constantly in flux.  
  
4. **Continuum of States**: Waves have a continuum of states (with different frequencies, amplitudes, etc.), and this can be used to describe the spectrum of conscious states from deep unconsciousness to heightened awareness.  
  
5. **Holistic Nature**: Waves, especially as conceptualized in fields like quantum mechanics, are inherently holistic - the entire wave pattern is important, not just individual points. This can be an analogy for how consciousness might be more than just the sum of individual neurological processes, encompassing a broader, more integrated experience.  
  
It’s important to note that these analogies are more philosophical or speculative in nature and are used to stimulate thinking about the complexities of consciousness. They are not literal descriptions but rather metaphorical tools to aid in understanding the elusive nature of consciousness. The exact nature of consciousness is still a major topic of research and debate in fields like neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy.
