# The Hero in the Ground  
  
[Verse 1]  
We saw the suffering in the sahā land   
And raised a helping hand    
We made a vow, solemn and deep    
Your precious Sūtra we would keep    
Through the perilous age to come.  
  
[Pred-Chorus]  
But the Honored One, he softly spoke   
A gentle word that stillness broke   
'Your kind assistance is not required'   
‘A different strength is here desired  
  
[Chorus]  
Then the earth began to break!   
For goodness' sake, a power awakes!   
Welling up from the very ground of pain   
A golden, brilliant, human rain   
And the truth hits me, see it now   
It's my own mission, my own vow   
**The hero isn't from the sky **  
**The hero has been me, all this time**  
  
[Verse 2]  
More countless than the river's sands   
The true disciples of this land   
Not from a distant Pure Land shore   
But from the world of 'suffer no more'   
They rose to meet the Buddha's gaze   
Taught by him through remotest days  
  
[Bridge]  
Even Maitreya couldn't understand   
'How could this teacher in this land   
In forty years, raise up this host?'   
It's for this age, when hope is lost   
In this corrupt and evil time (*mappō*)   
A deeper truth must rise and shine   
A vow to be born where sorrows grow   
To help the seeds of peace to sow  
  
[Outro]  
This is 'emerging from the earth'   
This is our vow, this is our birth   
From one small voice, a hundred sing   
The Mystic Law, the hope we bring   
*Nam-myoho-renge-kyo*... a single sound   
Welling up from the solid ground..."   
(repeat and fade)
