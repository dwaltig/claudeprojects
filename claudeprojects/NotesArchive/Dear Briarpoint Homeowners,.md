  
**Dear Briarpoint Homeowners,**  
  
As you know, participation in our Homeowners Association (HOA) meetings is essential for making important decisions about our community. However, we’ve noticed that achieving quorum—a minimum number of attendees required to proceed with official business—has been a challenge. This is where proxies come in, and we want to encourage you to take advantage of this option if you cannot attend a meeting in person.  
  
**What is a Proxy?**  
A proxy allows you to authorize someone else to vote on your behalf at an HOA meeting. It ensures that your voice is heard and your vote is counted, even if you can’t be present. By completing a proxy form, you either specify how you want your vote cast or allow the proxy holder to vote as they see fit.  
  
**Why Are Proxies Important?**  
When quorum isn’t met, decisions—like electing board members, approving budgets, or addressing important issues—can’t be made. This leads to delays, additional costs, and impacts on the smooth functioning of our community. By submitting a proxy, you help us avoid these setbacks and keep the HOA working efficiently.  
  
**How to Submit Your Proxy**  
We have included proxy forms in our distribution packet, and they will also be available on our community website. Simply fill out the form and return it to Creative Management Company or by email to mbostick@cmctx.com by October 17th. You can also specify a neighbor or board member to act as your proxy holder.  
  
Thank you for helping us ensure that your vote counts and our community remains well-managed. If you have any questions about proxies or need assistance, feel free to reach out.  
  
Sincerely,  
William Altig  
President, Briarpoint HOA
