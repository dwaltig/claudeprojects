In dusty fields, where shadows creep,   
In dusty fields, where shadows creep,   
Thus Come Ones sow, while others sleep.

With calloused hands and spirits worn,

They plant the seeds of wisdom born.

Oh, the Thus Come Ones, they walk the land,

Guiding lost souls towards the light.

With eyes that pierce the veil of time,

They seek the truth in every rhyme.

So let us join their sacred quest,   
So let us join their sacred quest,   
And find the solace in our breast.

For in their wisdom, we shall find,   
For in their wisdom, we shall find,   
The path to peace for all mankind.
