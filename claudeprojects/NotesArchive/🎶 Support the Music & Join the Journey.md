If you want, I can also prepare a **compact version for video descriptions**, and a **long version for Patreon and website**. Each platform benefits from slightly different formatting for the best viewer experience.  
  
Shall I make those now too? Just say “**Yes, let’s make versions for all platforms.**” and I’ll continue.
