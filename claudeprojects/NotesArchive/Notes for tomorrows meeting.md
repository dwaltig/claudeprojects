The greatness of truth enables us to follow it with joy. That which is true is always beneficial. Often, we do not follow the true and the good because of fear that "it does no good." Then we think that if we are to achieve happiness, we must contrive, or force it to happen. Yet when we attain spiritual strength and clarity, we see how well following the good does lead to our goals. I want to counsel us to follow the superior part of our nature—the great man, serving the good and the beautiful. The great man follows the path within.

There is no need for bullying. Hopefully we will find no need to resort to contending and contriving to get what we want. May we not use leverage in our conviction to force what is necessary, just as parents use spanking and even bribing to control their children. In letting go of using force, we let go of the "selfish little boy" in ourself. The path of the beautiful is not darkened by negative means.

Sincerity means to search our heart and mind for considerations and motives which destroy a just and moderate view of things, or which tempt us to break with what is essential and correct in our relationships. Sincere often means that in order to deal with our ego, it is necessary to ask humbly for help in finding the correct way.
