### Out of Reach — Conscious Hip-Hop on Struggle, Absence, and Awakening | William Altig Choir  
  
“Out of Reach” — Conscious Hip-Hop Song on Struggle, Absence, and Awakening  
By William Altig Choir  
  
“Out of Reach” is a deep and soulful conscious hip-hop track exploring the tension between struggle, absence, and self-realization. Inspired by timeless spiritual themes, this song offers poetic verses on suffering, denial, and the paradox of learning through distance.  
  
With powerful lyrics and heartfelt delivery, the song speaks to those who have faced life’s hardest moments — where help and wisdom seem distant, yet through the journey of seeking, true awakening and inner strength emerge.  
  
Through metaphors of the absent teacher, burning houses, and the unseen guide, “Out of Reach” offers hope and insight into personal growth, resilience, and the hidden light within each of us.  
  
Perfect for fans of spiritual rap, conscious hip-hop, and transformational music.  
  
🙏 Listen and reflect — the strength you seek has always been within.

Verse 1  
I see you sinking, struggling, drowning in the deep  
Caught in suffering's ocean, can't get no sleep  
I offered you a lifeline, you pushed it away  
"Not now, not this, maybe some other day"  
So I gotta disappear, that's my strategic move  
Sometimes absence is the only thing that proves  
The value of what's always been right in your face  
Creating that void so you finally embrace  
  
Hook  
When I'm gone, that's when you notice me (Notice me)  
When I'm gone, that's when you finally see (Finally see)  
When I'm gone, that's when you start to reach (Start to reach)  
The help was always there, just out of reach  
  
Verse 2  
Your house is burning but you're playing with the flame  
Poison in your system, you don't know who to blame  
I'm like that wise physician with the remedy in hand  
Stepping back so you finally understand  
It ain't about my ego or getting your respect  
It's about waking you up to what you neglect  
Sometimes the teacher's gotta exit the stage  
For the student to turn to the unread page  
  
Hook  
When I'm gone, that's when you notice me (Notice me)  
When I'm gone, that's when you finally see (Finally see)  
When I'm gone, that's when you start to reach (Start to reach)  
The help was always there, just out of reach  
  
Bridge  
I never really left though (No)  
I'm eternally present (Yes)  
The guiding spirit flowing  
Through your veins like a current  
You think I disappeared (Nah)  
But I've been here all along (Right here)  
When you stopped taking things for granted  
That's when my signal got strong  
  
Verse 3  
You gotta lose me to find me, that's the paradox  
When I'm out of sight, that's when your mind unlocks  
The hidden wisdom in plain view  
The path was always there, waiting on you  
I'm in the silence between your thoughts  
In the space where attachment gets caught  
I'm in the breath that you finally notice  
When suffering gets real and you lose your focus  
  
Hook  
When I'm gone, that's when you notice me (Notice me)  
When I'm gone, that's when you finally see (Finally see)  
When I'm gone, that's when you start to reach (Start to reach)  
The help was always there, just out of reach  
  
Outro x2  
So thank me for leaving, thank me for the space  
'Cause now you're seeking, looking for my face  
And in that seeking, you'll find what was true:  
The strength you're looking for—that strength is you
