Verse 1:  
Some folks hear my tune and their faces light up bright  
Others furrow their brows, lost in the night  
Each heart's a mirror, reflectin' back  
Ten worlds shimmerin', on a different track  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, the mirror's song, it sings in you and me  
Some see the light, some're waitin' to be free  
But every soul's got a spark, inside, burnin' deep  
And my music whispers, "Come, journey with me"  
  
Verse 2:  
Joy and confusion, dancin' side by side  
Ancient wisdom and doubt, they collide  
But in every heart, there's wisdom waitin' to shine  
Through the melodies and rhythms, we're all intertwined  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, the mirror's song, it sings in you and me  
Some see the light, some're waitin' to be free  
But every soul's got a spark, inside, burnin' deep  
And my music whispers, "Come, journey with me"  
And my music whispers, "Come, journey with me"  
  
Bridge:  
Through the chords and the silence  
We're searchin' for guidance  
Each soul's got its own way to see  
The tapestry of life and the wisdom in thee  
The tapestry of life and the wisdom in thee  
Oh, the whispers of the soul, it’s callin' out to you,   
Oh, the whispers of the soul, it’s callin' out to you,   
Oh, the whispers of the soul, it’s callin' out to you,   
Oh, the whispers of the soul, it’s callin' out to you,   
Oh, the whispers of the soul, it’s callin' out to you,   
Oh, the whispers of the soul, it’s callin' out to you,   
Are you ready to hear, the wisdom that's true?  
Are you ready to hear, the wisdom that's true?  
  
Verse 3:  
So let the music flow, let it embrace  
Echoes of compassion in every space  
'Cause in the quiet moments, between you and I  
True wisdom resides, where truth never dies  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, the mirror's song, it sings in you and me  
Some see the light, some're waitin' to be free  
But every soul's got a spark, inside, burnin' deep  
And my music whispers, "Come, journey with me"  
And my music whispers, "Come, journey with me"  
  
Outro:  
'Cause in the quiet moments, between you and I  
True wisdom resides, where truth never dies  
But every soul's got a spark, burnin' deep inside   
But every soul's got a spark, burnin' deep inside   
And my music whispers, "Come along for the ride"  
And my music whispers, "Come along for the ride"
