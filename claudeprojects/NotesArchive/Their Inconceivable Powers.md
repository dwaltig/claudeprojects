# Their Inconceivable Powers  
#   
1.	**Inconceivable is the power they wield—**  
**Those rooted in transcendent insight, revealed.**  
**With boundless vision, they perform their art,**  
**To gladden all beings and open the heart.**  
  
2.	They stretch their tongues across the skies,  
**Emitting beams that dazzle the eyes.**  
**A thousand rays their magic sends,**  
**Astonishing seekers on the path that never ends.**  
  
3.	**The Buddhas cough, a sacred sound,**  
**Snap their fingers—echoing all around.**  
**Throughout the tenfold world’s expanse,**  
**They call all beings to Dharma’s dance.**  
  
4.	**Their miracles bloom from love and grace,**  
**To fill all creatures with joy in place.**  
**So when the Sugata fades from sight,**  
**The Sutra remains, preserved in light.**  
  
5.	**Even through ages of countless years,**  
**If I spoke their praise, through joys and tears,**  
**I could not list their virtues all—**  
**These sons of the Buddha who heed the call.**  
  
6.	**Their merit is vast as boundless space,**  
**Beyond all measure, beyond all place.**  
**Unthinkable virtues in silence stay,**  
**With those who uphold the Sutra’s way.**  
  
7.	**They see me here, and those who’ve passed—**  
**The Buddhas gone, the truths that last.**  
**They see the host of sages bright,**  
**The fourfold ranks, bathed in light.**  
  
8.	**They honor me and the Jinas gone,**  
**And all the masters in every dawn.**  
**In every land, in every clime,**  
**They bow to truth beyond all time.**  
  
9.	**Past and future Buddhas arise,**  
**In ten directions, before their eyes.**  
**Such vision comes to one who keeps,**  
**This Sutra in their soul so deep.**  
  
10.	**The keeper of truth, so vast, so high,**  
**Will touch the mind of the Awakened Sky.**  
**They’ll know the truth on that sacred ground,**  
**Where the Buddha’s wisdom first was found.**  
  
11.	**With lightning mind and wind-like speed,**  
**No barrier shall block their deed.**  
**They grasp the Dharma’s deepest art,**  
**Its meaning settled in their heart.**  
  
12.	**Even after the Buddha’s flame is stilled,**  
**Their insight blooms, their mind fulfilled.**  
**They’ll see the Sutras interlace,**  
**And find their meaning, face to face.**  
  
13.	**Like moon and sun, they shine so wide,**  
**Spreading light on every side.**  
**Wandering earth in every land,**  
**They rouse Bodhisattvas with gentle hand.**  
  
14.	**The wise who hear these blessings told,**  
**And guard the Sutra, brave and bold—**  
**After my passing, pure and free,**  
**Will reach enlightenment, certainly.**
