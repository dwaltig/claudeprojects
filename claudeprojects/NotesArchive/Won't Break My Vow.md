# Won't Break My Vow  
  
(Verse 1)  
Got that Mappō blues a-settin' in my soul,  
Watching good roots dwindle, losing all control.  
Hearts are heavy, full of arrogance and greed,  
Plantin' bitter seeds, where good once took the lead.  
They're so hard to teach and transform, lost in their own way,  
Hateful, turbid, flattering, deceitful every day.  
  
(Chorus)  
But this Lotus truth, it burns within my core,  
Won't spare this body, won't spare my life,   
gonna spread this Dharma 'til there ain't no more strife.  
Though the evil world tries to drag me down,  
This Bodhisattva vow, it wears a crown.  
Got that great power of patience, shining bright and true,  
For universal liberation, I will see it through.  
  
(Verse 2)  
Hear 'em mockin' and they sneerin', "All of you are Buddhas now?"   
Don't understand the suffering, or the sweat upon my brow.  
Got those crooked minds, speakin' lies so smooth and sweet,  
Tryin' to call the Dharma 'bout as bitter as defeat.  
From inside and out, the strong enemies rise,  
With their slander and their scorn, hidden in disguise.  
  
(Chorus)  
But this Lotus truth, it burns within my core,  
Won't spare this body, won't spare my life,   
gonna spread this Dharma 'til there ain't no more strife.  
Though the evil world tries to drag me down,  
This Bodhisattva vow, it wears a crown.  
Got that great power of patience, shining bright and true,  
For universal liberation, I will see it through.  
  
(Bridge)  
They can banish me from temples, try to break my will,  
Write their false sutras, trying to stand still.  
But the Medicine-King's wisdom, and Great-Eloquence's call,  
Heal the spiritual afflictions, standing strong through it all.  
This Mappō won't truly come, the Sūtra makes it clear,  
Our determined actions, banish every fear.  
  
(Chorus)  
'Cause this Lotus truth, it burns within my core,  
Won't spare this body, won't spare my life,   
gonna spread this Dharma 'til there ain't no more strife.  
Though the evil world tries to drag me down,  
This Bodhisattva vow, it wears a crown.  
Got that great power of patience, shining bright and true,  
For universal liberation, I will see it through.  
  
(Outro)  
FUSHAKU SINMYO, hear the sacred sound,  
Spreading Lotus Light, on this hallowed ground.  
No Mappō blues can ever break my vow.  
The Dharma lives, from then until right now.
