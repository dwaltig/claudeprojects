Lyrics:   
(Verse 1)  
Oh, love suffers, suffers long,  
Through the heartache, right or wrong.  
Carries the weight, through storm and fire,  
Holding on, when the world conspires.  
  
(Chorus)  
Love don’t break, love don’t run,  
It’s the shadow and the sun.  
Through the darkness, it stays strong,  
Oh, love suffers, and suffers long.  
  
(Verse 2)  
It don’t count the cost of tears,  
Through the lonely, aching years.  
Keeps no record of the pain,  
Just finds the courage to love again.  
  
(Chorus)  
Love don’t break, love don’t run,  
It’s the shadow and the sun.  
Through the darkness, it stays strong,  
Oh, love suffers, and suffers long.  
  
(Bridge)  
It’s the kind of love that bends but won’t break,  
A fire in the soul, no one can take.  
It walks through the valley, stands in the rain,  
Love’s the melody that soothes the pain.  
  
(Outro)  
So let it be known, when the blues are sung,  
True love’s a battle, hard and won.  
Through every sorrow, love holds on,  
Oh, love suffers… and suffers long.
