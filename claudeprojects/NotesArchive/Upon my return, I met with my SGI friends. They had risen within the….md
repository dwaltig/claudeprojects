Upon my return, I met with my SGI friends. They had risen within the organization. They told me of some awful letter they received from me years ago that had my name removed from their records. I told them I didn’t remember such a letter. Nor did I ever do such a thing. I apologized and asked what can I do to make it up. They weren’t interested. They were clearly fixated upon this letter they couldn’t share with me but asked me to review my emails. Nothing like what they describe exists in my emails. I wrote a letter of apology. It was clear these words deeply hurt them.
