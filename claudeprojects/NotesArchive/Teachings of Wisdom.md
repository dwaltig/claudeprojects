Pre-Verse]  
Listen to this sacred teaching   
Listen to this sacred teaching   
with focused heart and mind,  
For rare is the chance to hear,   
For rare is the chance to hear,   
and rarer still to find belief in kind.  
  
[Chorus]  
Enter the abode of wisdom,   
Enter the abode of wisdom,   
don the robe of patience dear,  
Sit upon the seat of voidness,   
Sit upon the seat of voidness,   
let your preaching ring clear.  
  
[verse 1]  
Like a man in search of water,   
Like a man in search of water,   
digging in an arid land,  
digging in an arid land,  
digging in an arid land,  
Finding only dry sand,   
Finding only dry sand,   
in his desperate, thirsty hand.  
  
[verse 2]  
He thinks the water’s far away,   
He thinks the water’s far away,   
this dry sand tells the tale,  
But when moist and smooth it turns,   
But when moist and smooth it turns,   
hope begins to prevail.  
  
[Chorus]  
Enter the abode of wisdom,   
Enter the abode of wisdom,   
don the robe of patience dear,  
Sit upon the seat of voidness,   
Sit upon the seat of voidness,   
let your preaching ring clear.  
  
[Verse 3]  
So too are those far from truth,   
So too are those far from truth,   
who’ve not heard this teaching’s call,  
who’ve not heard this teaching’s call,  
who’ve not heard this teaching’s call,  
who’ve not heard this teaching’s call,  
who’ve not heard this teaching’s call,  
Who’ve failed to meditate on it,   
Who’ve failed to meditate on it,   
and grasp its meaning overall.  
  
[Verse 4]  
But those who’ve heard and pondered deep,   
But those who’ve heard and pondered deep,   
this profound king of strings,  
this profound king of strings,  
this profound king of strings,  
this profound king of strings,  
Are wise and near enlightenment,   
Are wise and near enlightenment,   
their understanding reaching.  
  
[Chorus]  
Enter the abode of wisdom,   
Enter the abode of wisdom,   
don the robe of patience dear,  
Sit upon the seat of voidness,   
Sit upon the seat of voidness,   
let your preaching ring clear.  
let your preaching ring clear.
