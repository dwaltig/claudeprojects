# Blooming Truth  
  
## The Ocean's Embrace  
  
Within the **vast ocean** of compassion deep,  
A teaching rises, gentle as the tide,  
Promising all beings, no soul to weep,  
As boundless joy spreads horizons wide.  
  
## The Mountain's Promise  
  
Like **Mount Sumeru** steadfast and kind,  
The Lotus offers refuge, strong yet mild,  
Where seekers with a truth-devoted mind  
Find hope rekindled, spirits reconciled.  
  
## Celestial Comfort  
  
The **radiant moon** bathes all in silver grace,  
Its light a blessing, not distant or cold,  
But warm with love for all the human race,  
A happiness neither bought nor sold.  
  
## Benevolent Guide  
  
Not as a **crowned king** of stern command,  
But as a friend who lifts the weary heart,  
The Lotus takes us gently by the hand,  
Granting each soul a fresh, hopeful start.  
  
## Nurturing Presence  
  
An **elder's** smile, a grandfather's care,  
This wisdom nurtures like the morning dew,  
Filling our spirits with courage to dare,  
To make our shattered worlds anew.  
  
## Harmonious Guardian  
  
The **national ruler** whose only decree  
Is universal kindness, peace profound,  
Inviting all to taste true liberty,  
Where joy and hope abundantly abound.  
  
## Radiance of Awakening  
  
**Sun and moon** dance in joyful light,  
Illuminating paths once dark with fear,  
The Lotus blooms through day and night,  
Whispering "awakening draws near."  
  
In one heart's opening,  
Ten thousand flowers bloom.
