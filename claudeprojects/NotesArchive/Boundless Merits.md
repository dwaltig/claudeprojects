**Verse 1:**  
**Verse 1:**  
In shadows we wander,   
In shadows we wander,   
in shadows we stray,  
In shadows we search   
In shadows we search   
for a brighter day.  
We strive and we stumble,   
We strive and we stumble,   
we fight and we fall,  
But seeing truth in all things,   
that’s the greatest call.  
  
**Chorus:**  
**Chorus:**  
Boundless are the merits,   
Boundless are the merits,   
boundless is the way,  
Boundless are the hearts   
Boundless are the hearts   
that hear what Buddha says.  
Strip away illusions,   
strip away the lies,  
In the sutra’s wisdom,   
In the sutra’s wisdom,   
find the clear blue skies.  
  
**Verse 2:**  
**Verse 2:**  
Merits are no treasures,   
Merits are no treasures,   
merits are no gold,  
Merits lie in moments   
Merits lie in moments   
where compassion unfolds.  
Each act of kindness,   
each word that heals,  
Transforms the world   
Transforms the world   
with the love it reveals.

Boundless are the hearts   
that hear what Buddha says.  
Strip away illusions,   
strip away the lies,  
In the sutra’s wisdom,   
In the sutra’s wisdom,   
find the clear blue skies.  
find the clear blue skies.

**Bridge:**  
**Bridge:**  
Oh, Invincible one,   
Oh, Invincible one,   
hear the whispered truth,  
In silence and in stillness,   
we find the proof.  
Not in might or madness,   
Not in might or madness,   
not in fear or fight,  
But in the simple seeing,   
But in the simple seeing,   
in the peaceful night.  
  
**Chorus:**  
**Chorus:**  
Boundless are the merits,   
Boundless are the merits,   
boundless is the way,  
Boundless are the hearts   
that hear what Buddha says.  
Strip away illusions,   
Strip away illusions,   
strip away the lies,  
In the sutra’s wisdom,   
In the sutra’s wisdom,   
find the clear blue skies.  
  
**Outro:**  
**Outro:**  
Open up the heart,   
Open up the heart,   
let the sutra sing,  
Find the truth in stillness,   
find the joy it brings.  
Boundless are the merits,   
Boundless are the merits,   
boundless is the view,  
For the Lotus blooms eternal   
For the Lotus blooms eternal   
when the heart is true.  
when the heart is true.
