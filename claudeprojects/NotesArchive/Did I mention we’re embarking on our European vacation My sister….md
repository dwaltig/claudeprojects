Did I tell you? We’re getting ready to go on our vacation to Europe? My sister-in-law and her husband gave us a gift of a lifetime, a seven-night cruise of the Adriatic Sea and Greek Isles. August 13th, we leave Houston via Turkish Air Business Class for a 12-hour flight with five-star service to Istanbul and connect to another 3-hour flight to Venice, Italy. We’ll spend two nights in Venice exploring the sights and culture before taking a three-hour train south to Ravenna, Italy, where we’ll board a Royal Caribbean cruise ship, Explorer of the Seas. We’ve booked a stateroom with a sea balcony view. We’ve booked three excursions for Kotor, Montenegro; Athens, Greece; and Santorini, Greece. We haven’t decided what to do for the last island, “Argostini.” After the cruise, we’ll spend one night in Bologna, Italy, before we head back to Houston, again with 5-star service Business Class, a 13-hour flight home.
