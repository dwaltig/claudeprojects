Verse 1  
Like a man born without sight,  
Who claims there’s no day, no night,  
No sun, no moon, no starlight,  
For he’s known only endless night.  
  
Verse 2  
But a doctor, kind and wise,  
Brings the man a great surprise.  
From the mountain, he supplies,  
Four herbs to heal his eyes.  
  
Chorus  
With these herbs, the man can see,  
From his blindness, he is free.  
“I was wrong, I now agree,  
The world is more than I decree.”

Verse 3  
So too, are the beings blind,  
In the whirl of life confined.  
Until the Enlightened One, kind,  
Opens the eye of the mind.  
  
Verse 4  
To the blind, the Enlightened One shows,  
Three vehicles to ease their woes.  
But only one true path bestows,  
The way to where enlightenment flows.  
  
Chorus  
With these herbs, the man can see,  
From his blindness, he is free.  
“I was wrong, I now agree,  
The world is more than I decree.”

Verse 5  
A disciple, once in the whirl,  
Finds a pearl, his mind unfurls.  
Yet, “I’ve reached Nirvana,” he’ll twirl,  
Not knowing, it’s more than one swirl.  
  
Verse 6  
But the Sage, seeing his pride,  
Says, “There’s more outside your stride.  
From your room, the world is wide,  
Your knowledge, it’s time to guide.”  
  
Chorus  
From within, you cannot see,  
What lies outside, what’s yet to be.  
If you think you’re wise as a tree,  
You’re mistaken, as can be.  
  
Verse 7  
You can’t hear, five leagues away,  
The drumbeat’s call, the children’s play.  
You can’t see, in light of day,  
You can’t see, in light of day,  
Who’s friend or foe, who’ll betray.  
  
Verse 8  
You can’t walk a mile alone,  
Without a path that’s clearly shown.  
You’ve forgotten what you’ve known,  
In the womb where you’ve grown.  
  
Chorus  
From within, you cannot see,  
What lies outside, what’s yet to be.  
If you think you’re wise as a tree,  
You’re mistaken, as can be.  
You’re mistaken, as can be.  
(You’re mistaken, as can be.)  
(You’re mistaken, as can be.)  
(You’re mistaken, as can be.)  
(You’re mistaken, as can be.)

Verse 9  
“If omniscience is your quest,  
Seek wisdom, put your mind to test.  
In the wilderness, you’ll be blessed,  
With transcendent faculties, no jest.  
  
Verse 10  
Heed the meaning, make the climb,  
To the wilderness sublime.  
There, in peace, and over time,  
You’ll gain these faculties divine.”  
  
Chorus  
With understanding clear and bright,  
The disciple gains new insight.  
No longer in the whirl’s plight,  
Yet Nirvana’s not in sight.  
  
Verse 11  
True repose, a stop, a pause,  
But not the final, sacred cause.  
An artifice, without true laws,  
Yet closer to the truth, because…  
  
Verse 12  
To reach Nirvana, pure and true,  
There’s still more work for you to do.  
The path of time, the utmost few,  
The void, the boundless, in your view.  
  
Chorus  
See the world as but a dream,  
A phantom river’s silent stream.  
Unborn, undying, it may seem,  
An echo in the cosmic scheme.  
  
Verse 13  
He who sees all laws the same,  
Unbound, unlit, without a name.  
In darkness and in light, no claim,  
He knows true rest, beyond the game.  
  
Verse 14  
He who knows that all is void,  
Each law, each truth, each paranoid.  
Each moment lived, each moment enjoyed,  
Sees Nirvana, the truth deployed.  
  
Chorus  
There are not three paths to be,  
Only one vehicle, for you and me.  
In this world, it’s key to see,  
The one true path to be free.
