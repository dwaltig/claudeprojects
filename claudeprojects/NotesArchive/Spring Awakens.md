[Intro]  
[Verse]  
Spring breeze blows soft and light  
Whispers blow through trees so high  
Shoots of green in morning's sight  
Frozen hearts begin to fly  
  
[Verse 2]  
Sincere words they heal the cold  
Melting frost of doubt and fear  
Encouragement so pure and bold  
Courage blooms when hope is near  
  
[Chorus]  
Thaw my heart and let me see  
Rejuvenate this spirit   
Strong  
Power lies in words so free  
In your voice I find my song  
  
[Verse 3]  
Frozen hearts no longer still  
Tender sprouts and vibrant skies  
With your help they find the will  
Life returns to weary eyes  
  
[Bridge]  
Softest touch of morning dew  
Thawing ice from within  
Lights a path that we pursue  
Courage finds a way to win  
  
[Chorus]  
Thaw my heart and let me see  
Rejuvenate this spirit  
Strong  
Power lies in words so free  
In your voice I find my song  
  
[Outro]   
And with the dawn,   
a brand new start   
Hope awakened   
In my heart  
  
  
  
[End]
