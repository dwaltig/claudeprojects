# The Same Moon  
The night was ink, the sutras closed and deep,  
Where golden words were promises to keep.  
You sought the truth within your teacher's gaze,  
Lost in the turning of his ancient phrase.  
  
Above, a pearl of perfect silver hung,  
A silent truth on every shadow flung.  
His hand arose, a gesture slow and spare,  
One finger lifted in the temple air.  
  
"The path," he said, his voice a quiet guide,  
"Is where the Buddha's very words reside."  
A weathered finger, elegant and old,  
A signpost pointing, braver than pure gold.  
  
And you, you studied where the finger led,  
But saw the finger, not the light it shed.  
You traced the knuckle, memorized the line,  
Mistook the vessel for the sacred wine.  
  
The pointing was the object of your quest,  
The moon forgotten, hidden in your breast.  
He did not chide, nor did he speak again,  
But let the silence fall like gentle rain.  
  
His gaze was not upon his hand, you saw,  
But on the source of that unspoken law.  
He watched the light he knew you had to find,  
The shared reflection in his heart and mind.  
  
And then you looked. You lifted up your eyes  
Beyond the hand, to where the real truth lies.  
And there it was. Not distant, not unknown,  
The very moon you'd always called your own.  
  
No master's moon, no secret, holy sphere,  
But the same light that makes the whole world clear.  
The finger fell, its purpose understood.  
A simple branch that pointed through the wood.  
  
The moon remained, serene and ever-bright,  
And bathed you both in one impartial light.  
The words were true, but only as a start,  
To find the moon that shines within the heart.
