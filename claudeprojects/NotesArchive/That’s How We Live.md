**Lyrics: **  
**Intro:**  
*I was taught not by force, but by love,*  
*No shame, no fight, just a higher way above,*  
*Lead by example, watch the change begin,*  
*Through the light of awakening, we all can win.*  
  
**Verse 1:**  
*I was lost in the dark, didn’t see the light,*  
*Caught up in the noise, thinking might makes right,*  
*But my people showed me different, through action, not words,*  
*No shame, no degrading, just the power of worth.*  
  
*They didn’t push me down, they pulled me up high,*  
*Through compassion and wisdom, helped me touch the sky,*  
*No need for conflict, no need for blame,*  
*Just walking the path, that’s how you change the game.*  
  
**Chorus:**  
*Lead by example, no shame, no blame,*  
*Rise above the hate, stay true to the name,*  
*The path of awakening, compassion in action, *  
*Transform through love, it’s a powerful game.*  
  
**Verse 2:**  
*It’s easy to fight, to shame, to tear down,*  
*But real power’s in peace, that’s where truth is found,*  
*My friends showed me strength in the gentlest way,*  
*Through the lessons they lived, every single day.*  
  
*We share the enlightened human condition, that’s real,*  
*No force, just wisdom—that’s how you heal,*  
*We rise by lifting others, that’s the law of life,*  
*Overcoming the struggle, turning pain into light.*  
  
**Chorus:**  
*Lead by example, no shame, no blame,*  
*Rise above the hate, stay true to the name,*  
*The path of awakening, compassion in action, *  
*Transform through love, it’s a powerful game.*  
  
**Bridge:**  
*No need to argue, no need to fight,*  
*Just shine the truth, like the brightest light,*  
*When you walk the way, others will see,*  
*This is the path that sets you free.*  
  
*Through the wonders we live, the message is clear,*  
*Peace in the heart, we got nothing to fear,*  
*We’re sharing our light, planting seeds of change,*  
*Awakening the world, we’re breaking every chain.*  
  
**Chorus:**  
*Lead by example, no shame, no blame,*  
*Rise above the hate, stay true to the name,*  
*The path of awakening, compassion in action, *  
*Transform through love, it’s a powerful game.*  
  
**Outro:**  
*So now we walk this path, step by step we grow,*  
*Through the love we give, the whole world will know,*  
*It’s not about force, it’s about what we give,*  
*Meditation in action—that’s how we live.*
