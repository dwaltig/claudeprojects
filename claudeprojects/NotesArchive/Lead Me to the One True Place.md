# Lead Me to the One True Place  
  
(a slide guitar and a steady, soulful rhythm behind this)  
(Tempo: Slow, soulful 4/4)  
(Style: Keb' Mo' / Jason Isbell)  
  
(Verse 1)  
I started out in darkness, walkin' slow  
Headed back to darkness, the only road I know  
I built my house on a mistaken view  
Thought a lie could be solid, thought a lie could be true  
But from that one mistake, the poisons start to flow  
There’s the greedy hand, and the anger that won't let go  
  
(Verse 2)  
I’m livin' in a cage that my own hands made  
I hammered in the nails, and then I stayed  
I fell into a world of fear and rage  
My own reflection starin' from the page  
I don't know how to do good, my compass lost  
I never even stopped to count the cost  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, my soul, been lost so long  
Don't even know where I went wrong  
I lost the memory of the joy I knew  
Just howlin' at that cold, dark moon  
I need a guide, I need a lovin' grace  
To lead me to the one true place  
(Verse 3)  
The guide, he saw the journey was too hard  
He saw my broken faith, my every card  
He saw me stumblin', 'bout to turn and run  
My whole damn story over 'fore it begun  
So with a gentle hand, a truly skillful guide  
He built a shinin' city, deep inside  
That wilderness, a place to rest my bones  
A wayside goal of painted, hopeful stones  
(Chorus)  
Oh, my soul, been lost so long  
Don't even know where I went wrong  
I lost the memory of the joy I knew  
Just howlin' at that cold, dark moon  
I need a guide, I need a lovin' grace  
To lead me to the one true place  
(Verse 4)  
I thought I'd made it, thought my fight was done  
Thought I'd found my peace beneath that settin' sun  
But when I'd rested, when I'd regained my will  
He dissolved that shinin' city on the hill  
He said, "That wasn't home, son, that was just a rest  
"A shelter from the storm to help you pass the test  
"The real and final treasure is ahead  
"Your truest nature's sleepin', it ain't dead."  
(Final Chorus)  
Oh, my soul, been lost so long  
But now I see where I went wrong  
I'm findin' the memory of the joy I knew  
Shinin' brighter than that cold, dark moon  
He is the guide, He is the lovin' grace  
He'll lead us all home to the one true place  
Yeah, He's the guide, He is the lovin' grace  
Lead us all home to the one true place.
