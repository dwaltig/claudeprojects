# The Common Good’s Call  
*(hopeful, gospel-tinged folk)*  
  
**Verse 1**  
I thought the road had ended, left the inner fire behind,  
Found a quiet clearing, a day’s reward for mind.  
But a wider garden waited, roots beneath the soil,  
My hard-won calm was only ground to start a deeper toil.  
  
**Chorus**  
Oh, the world has a grand design, and I’m part of it, it’s true—  
Not just for myself, but for me **and** for you.  
One human journey, beginning without end,  
Opening wisdom’s door for all, a steadfast friend.  
  
**Verse 2**  
An elder’s gentle teaching cleared illusions from my way,  
Not just greed or anger, but the lie that I must stay  
Small and undeserving, chained to what I’d known,  
While the seed of boundless being was already my own.  
  
**Verse 3**  
The voice that whispered *finished* could never speak my worth;  
A birthright vast and shining had been with me from birth.  
That hidden light keeps rising, steady as the dawn,  
Waiting for awakening so its brilliance carries on.  
  
**Chorus**  
Oh, the world has a grand design, and I’m part of it, it’s true—  
Not just for myself, but for me **and** for you.  
One human journey, beginning without end,  
Opening wisdom’s door for all, a steadfast friend.  
  
**Bridge**  
From personal freedom to a mission wide and kind,  
Seeing this rough world as promise, leaving none behind.  
No sudden flash of magic, but practice brave and slow,  
Until the myth of separation is finally let go.  
  
**Outro**  
The common good keeps calling—its music in my nerve;  
With courage and compassion, I answer and I serve.  
The world’s vast, living potential is right here where we stand;  
That measureless treasure beats in every heart, my friend.
