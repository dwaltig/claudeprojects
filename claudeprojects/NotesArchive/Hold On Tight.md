Lyrics:   
(Verse 1)  
The world is spinning, faster it seems,  
Old truths are fading, like forgotten dreams.  
The shadows lengthen, the days grow cold,  
Stories of the end times, by prophets told.  
  
(Chorus)  
But hold on tight, to love's embrace,  
In these troubled times, find your grace.  
Though the storms may rage, and darkness fall,  
Hope's ember glows, within us all.  
  
(Verse 2)  
The wise ones whisper, of a coming change,  
A shifting tide, upon the range.  
The old ways crumble, the new arise,  
A chance to awaken, with open eyes.  
  
(Chorus)  
But hold on tight, to love's embrace,  
In these troubled times, find your grace.  
Though the storms may rage, and darkness fall,  
Hope's ember glows, within us all.  
  
(Bridge)  
Let go of fear, let go of strife,  
Embrace the moment, this precious life.  
In every ending, a new beginning,  
A chance to rise, above the sinning.  
  
(Chorus)  
But hold on tight, to love's embrace,  
In these troubled times, find your grace.  
Though the storms may rage, and darkness fall,  
Hope's ember glows, within us all.  
  
(Outro)  
So let your heart be your guiding light,  
Through the darkness, shine ever so bright.  
For even in the end, love will remain,  
A beacon of hope, in the pouring rain.
