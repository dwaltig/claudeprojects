Verse 1  
In a forest wide and wondrous, stood a tree so tall and grand,  
Its roots dug deep in the earth below, its branches touched the stars’ expanse.  
They called it the Magic Tree, a marvel to behold,  
They called it the Magic Tree, a marvel to behold,  
They called it the Magic Tree, a marvel to behold,  
With leaves that whispered every tongue, in stories yet untold.  
  
Chorus  
Oh, the Magic Tree, reaching up to touch the sky,  
Oh, the Magic Tree, reaching up to touch the sky,  
Oh, the Magic Tree, reaching up to touch the sky,  
Bringing words from every land, teaching hearts to never die.  
From its roots down to the heavens, it unites both you and me,  
In the language of compassion, from the Magic Tree.  
In the language of compassion, from the Magic Tree.  
In the language of compassion, from the Magic Tree.  
  
Verse 2  
Mira came from distant lands, with a heart weighed down with care,  
She longed to speak and understand, but felt lost most everywhere.  
She rested ’neath that mighty tree, and it spoke in her own tongue,  
“Plant these seeds in every town, let understanding be begun.”  
  
Chorus  
Oh, the Magic Tree, reaching up to touch the sky,  
Oh, the Magic Tree, reaching up to touch the sky,  
Oh, the Magic Tree, reaching up to touch the sky,  
Bringing words from every land, teaching hearts to never die.  
From its roots down to the heavens, it unites both you and me,  
In the language of compassion, from the Magic Tree.  
In the language of compassion, from the Magic Tree.  
In the language of compassion, from the Magic Tree.  
  
Verse 3  
She took the seeds and traveled on, planting in each place she went,  
And from the soil of kindness grew, trees of understanding sent.  
But in soils dark with anger’s blight, the fruits were sharp and cold,  
Yet love and patience turned them sweet, as wisdom took its hold.  
  
Chorus  
Oh, the Magic Tree, reaching up to touch the sky,  
Oh, the Magic Tree, reaching up to touch the sky,  
Oh, the Magic Tree, reaching up to touch the sky,  
Bringing words from every land, teaching hearts to never die.  
From its roots down to the heavens, it unites both you and me,  
In the language of compassion, from the Magic Tree.  
In the language of compassion, from the Magic Tree.  
In the language of compassion, from the Magic Tree.  
In the language of compassion, from the Magic Tree.

Bridge  
Now its branches touch the stars above, its roots are strong and deep,  
A bridge between the earth and sky, where hearts and spirits meet.  
It teaches us to speak with love, in every word we share,  
To find the common ground we seek, with kindness everywhere.  
  
Chorus  
Oh, the Magic Tree, reaching up to touch the sky,  
Oh, the Magic Tree, reaching up to touch the sky,  
Oh, the Magic Tree, reaching up to touch the sky,  
Bringing words from every land, teaching hearts to never die.  
From its roots down to the heavens, it unites both you and me,  
In the language of compassion, from the Magic Tree.  
In the language of compassion, from the Magic Tree.  
In the language of compassion, from the Magic Tree.  
  
Outro  
So let us plant and tend our seeds, in soil rich and pure,  
And watch our trees touch the heavens, with love that will endure.  
For the Magic Tree stands tall, a guide for you and me,  
For the Magic Tree stands tall, a guide for you and me,  
For the Magic Tree stands tall, a guide for you and me,  
For the Magic Tree stands tall, a guide for you and me,  
To speak in words of unity, and live in harmony.  
To speak in words of unity, and live in harmony.
