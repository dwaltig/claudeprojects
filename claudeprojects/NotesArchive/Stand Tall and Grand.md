# Stand Tall and Grand  
  
[Verse 1]  
Upon the path of life we tread,  
Ignore the wicked voice of dread.  
Stand not in sinners' way, take heed,  
In scornful banter, find no creed.  
  
[Chorus]  
But love the lessons life unfolds,  
Recite them in your heart through roads untold.  
Like a tree by the water, standing grand,  
Rooted deeply in life's shifting sand.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Bear fruit in time, under prosperity’s light,  
Thrive in the day and find peace at night.  
But not so are they, who stray and roam,  
Like chaff in the wind, without a home.  
  
[Verse 3]  
[Verse 3]  
[Verse 3]  
[Verse 3]  
[Verse 3]  
Justice’s court won’t see their face,  
Nor in the crowd of the righteous, find their place.  
For paths of the just are clear and defined,  
While ways of the wrecked to ruin are aligned.  
  
[Chorus]  
But love the lessons life unfolds,  
Recite them in your heart through roads untold.  
Like a tree by the water, so grand,  
Rooted deeply in life's sacred sand.  
  
[Chorus]  
But love the lessons life unfolds,  
Recite them in your heart through roads untold.  
Like a tree by the water, so grand,  
Rooted deeply in life's sacred sand.  
Rooted deeply in life's sacred sand.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Bear fruit in time, under prosperity’s light,  
Thrive in the day and find peace at night.  
But not so are they, who stray and roam,  
Like chaff in the wind, without a home.  
  
[Bridge]  
Justice’s court won’t see their face,  
Nor in the crowd of the righteous, find their place.  
For paths of the just are clear and defined,  
While ways of the wrecked to ruin are aligned.  
  
[Chorus]  
Love the lessons life unfolds,  
Love the lessons life unfolds,  
Recite them in your heart through roads untold.  
Like a tree by the water, so grand,  
Rooted deeply in life's shifting sand.  
Rooted deeply in life's shifting sand.  
Rooted deeply in life's shifting sand.  
Rooted deeply in life's shifting sand.  
Rooted deeply in life's shifting sand.
