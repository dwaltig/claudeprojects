**Why the Caged Bird Sings (Revised Draft)**  
  
(Verse 1)   
In a world of sorrow, dark and deep   
Where shadows of confusion softly creep   
A little bird sits, wings unseen   
Trapped by old habits, a clouded dream   
This cage of mind, a heavy chain   
Born of old fears, sorrow, and pain   
It yearns for skies it's never known   
A seed of truth, yet overgrown  
(Chorus)   
Oh, why the caged bird sings, with a timeless, hopeful plea?   
It's awakening the truth, from deep inside of me   
Calling forth the light, for all the world to see   
To break these chains and soar, wild and free.  
(Verse 2)   
It found a sound, a sacred call   
**Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo**, standing tall   
A simple chant, a fervent plea   
To the wisdom deep inside of me   
This quiet whisper, then a roar   
My true self knocking on the door   
It’s the key that sets the spirit free   
For inner peace, for you and me.  
(Chorus)   
Oh, why the caged bird sings, with a timeless, hopeful plea?   
It's awakening the truth, from deep inside of me   
Calling forth the light, for all the world to see   
To break these chains and soar, wild and free.  
(Verse 3)   
Then from the heavens, clear and high   
Uncaged birds begin to fly Forces of light, their spirits bright Inner wisdom answers with pure light   
They gather 'round, a sacred throng   
Protecting those who sing the song   
A promise kept, through firmest faith   
No endless waiting, no more wait.  
(Bridge)   
Gotta lay down the banner of my pride   
Cast prejudice and hatred far aside   
For this immediate path, this life's own grace   
To find enlightenment in this time and place   
It's not just hope, it's strong resolve   
As inner darkness starts to dissolve.  
(Chorus)   
Oh, that's why the caged bird sings, with a timeless, hopeful plea!   
It's awakening the truth, from deep inside of me   
Calling forth the light, for all the world to see   
To break these chains and soar, wild and free.  
(Outro)   
The cage is gone, the sky is wide   
With inner wisdom as my guide   
Now I can soar, this very day   
On the universal path, come what may.
