# Through the Wild Winds  
  
[Intro]  
  
[Verse 1]  
In the midst of change,   
I find my way,  
Through the wild winds   
of yesterday.  
I’ve walked through storms,   
felt the highs and lows,  
In every step,   
the light still grows.  
  
[Chorus]  
Embrace the change,   
let it set you free,  
In the dance of life,   
find your melody.  
Grounded in the truth,   
of the Lotus bloom,  
I’ll rise above,   
in every room.  
  
[Verse 2]  
With each new dawn,   
the journey starts anew,  
Dream weavers and muses,   
blending skies of blue.  
Harnessing the good,   
from the gifts they bring,  
In the symphony of life,   
I’ll sing.  
  
[Chorus]  
Embrace the change,   
let it set you free,  
In the dance of life,   
find your melody.  
Grounded in the truth,   
of the Lotus bloom,  
I’ll rise above,   
in every room.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[Bridge]  
Balancing the scales,   
with self-care’s touch,  
In the arms of friends,   
who mean so much.  
Clear goals ahead,   
with steps so sure,  
In community,   
we find the cure.  
  
[Chorus]  
Embrace the change,   
let it set you free,  
In the dance of life,   
find your melody.  
Grounded in the truth,   
of the Lotus bloom,  
I’ll rise above,   
in every room.  
  
[Outro]  
Stay informed,   
let knowledge be your guide,  
With resilience and strength,   
I’ll stride.  
In the ever-changing tides,   
I’ll thrive,  
With hope and love,   
I’m alive.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[End]
