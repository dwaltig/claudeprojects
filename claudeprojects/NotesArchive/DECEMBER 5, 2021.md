LOTUS SUTRA LECTURE:  
"Actualize Your Inner Potential By Modeling the Lotus Sutra's Bodhisattvas."  
  
How often do you read, recite and study the applicational section of the Lotus Sutra?  Even the most devoted practitioner of the Lotus Sutra and those very familiar with its teachings often neglect the final chapters of the text.  However, because they personify the inherent powers of our buddha nature, emulating the bodhisattvas of the applicational section of the Lotus Sutra is indispensable to liberating ourselves to others from suffering and aspiring to the highest awakening.  Join me for an exploration of modeling ourselves on the bodhisattvas of the Lotus Sutra to manifest our inner potential.
