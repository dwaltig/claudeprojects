Lyrics:  
  
Verse 1:  
Three weeks walkin’ on this path I’ve roamed,  
Sown the seeds of truths unknown,   
Roots run deep, their branches shown,  
Revealed when Samantabhadra comes down, alone.  
  
Chorus:  
White as snow, that elephant gleams,  
Gleams with six tusks, shining like moonlit streams.  
Streams of light, where Bodhisattvas ride,  
Ride with spells, turning the eternal tide.  
  
Verse 2:  
Words of power now make me strong,  
Strong to face what’s been wrong all along.  
Wrong paths dim, deceptions fade and fall,  
Fall away at wisdom’s resounding call.  
  
Chorus:  
White as snow, that elephant gleams,  
Gleams with six tusks, shining like moonlit streams.  
Streams of light, where Bodhisattvas ride,  
Ride with spells, turning the eternal tide.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
Bridge:  
Adande, hear justice ring,  
Rings like a bell with Dandāvartani’s swing.  
Dandakusale, balance, restore,  
Restores the truth to Sudhārapati’s shore.  
  
Verse 3:  
Buddhapasyani, clear my inner sight,  
Sight that sees through day and hears through night.  
Night and day, Āvartani turns the wheel,  
The wheel spins until Sanghaparīkshite heals.  
  
Chorus:  
White as snow, that elephant gleams,  
Gleams with six tusks, shining like moonlit streams.  
Streams of light, where Bodhisattvas ride,  
Ride with spells, turning the eternal tide.  
  
Outro:  
Dharmaparīkshite tests every law,  
Law that leaves all evil slack-jawed in awe.  
Jaws drop at Simhavikrīdite’s mighty roar,  
Roaring spells, resounding forevermore.  
Roaring spells, resounding forevermore.
