# The Great Spiritual Seeker Blues  
  
This song draws its inspiration from the profound teachings of the Lotus Sutra, particularly Chapter 14, which speaks to the qualities of a true spiritual seeker in times of spiritual decline. The lyrics reflect the journey of a Bodhisattva—an enlightened being dedicated to guiding others—who walks a path of compassion, wisdom, and integrity.  
  
Set against the backdrop of the beautiful Willamette Valley in the Pacific Northwest, the song captures the serene yet powerful essence of this sacred journey. The river’s flow through the valley symbolizes the continuous movement of wisdom and spiritual insight, while the majestic Coastal and Cascade mountain ranges represent the steadfast presence of the enlightened ones who guide us.  
  
The blend of blues and contemporary folk elements in the music echoes the timeless nature of these teachings, inviting listeners to reflect on their own spiritual path. With choir voices, guitar, stand-up bass, drums, and harmonica, the song brings together the richness of tradition with the heartfelt emotion of a seeker’s journey.  
  
"The Great Spiritual Seeker Blues" is not just a song—it’s a meditation on the qualities that define true spiritual leadership and the unwavering commitment to the well-being of all beings. It serves as a reminder that even in challenging times, there is always a guiding light for those who seek it.

Lyrics:  
  
The Great Spiritual Seeker Blues  
  
(Verse 1)  
In a world that’s lost its light,  
Where true teachings fade from sight,  
The Great Spiritual Seeker walks,  
Through the shadows, bears no spite.  
  
(Chorus)  
They don’t let envy cloud their view,  
No deceit within their soul,  
They lift us up with a gentle touch,  
Their compassion makes us whole.  
  
(Verse 2)  
They honor every soul they meet,  
From the humble to the elite,  
With reverence for the Thus Come Ones,  
Their respect’s a steady beat.  
  
(Chorus)  
They don’t let envy cloud their view,  
No deceit within their soul,  
They lift us up with a gentle touch,  
Their compassion makes us whole.  
  
(Reprise-Verse 2)  
They honor every soul they meet,  
From the humble to the elite,  
With reverence for the Thus Come Ones,  
Their respect’s a steady beat.  
  
(Chorus)  
They don’t let envy cloud their view,  
No deceit within their soul,  
They lift us up with a gentle touch,  
Their compassion makes us whole.  
  
(Bridge)  
They honor every soul they meet,  
From the humble to the elite,  
  
Disputes and quarrels have no place,  
In their rhythm, they find grace,  
They share the truth with an open heart,  
With every soul, they embrace.  
  
(Verse 3)  
Their love for teachings, it’s so deep,  
In every verse, their wisdom seeps,  
They cherish all, both big and small,  
Through their grace, the truth they keep.  
  
(Chorus)  
They don’t let envy cloud their view,  
No deceit within their soul,  
They lift us up with a gentle touch,  
Their compassion makes us whole.  
  
(Verse 4)  
Support will rise where they stand tall,  
In gatherings, their light won’t fall,  
Attentive ears will catch their call,  
Their words will echo through it all.  
  
(Chorus)  
They don’t let envy cloud their view,  
No deceit within their soul,  
They lift us up with a gentle touch,  
Their compassion makes us whole.  
  
(Outro)  
In the twilight of time’s end,  
Their presence is a guiding friend,  
A beacon for the weary heart,  
Their legacy, it will not bend.
