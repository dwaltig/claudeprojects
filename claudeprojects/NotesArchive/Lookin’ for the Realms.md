# Lookin’ for the Realms  
  
"Lookin' for the Realms" is a folk-inspired song with Eastern influences that explores the idea that heaven and hell, suffering and enlightenment, are not external places but states of mind we experience within ourselves. The song encourages listeners to embark on a journey of self-discovery, to become mindful of their inner world, and to recognize the impermanence of emotions in order to cultivate greater wisdom and compassion. With its contemplative lyrics, evocative imagery, and uplifting chorus, "Lookin' for the Realms" invites you to look inward and discover the peace that lies within.

*(Verse 1)* I see your face, it’s changin’,   
like the weather in the wind, Anger, greed, and sorrow,   
they keep pullin’ you in. In every glance, I’m witness   
to the pain that you hold tight, But if we look a little deeper,   
we might just find the light.  
  
*(Chorus)* Oh, we’re lookin’ for the realms,   
they’re hidin’ deep inside, From the hells to the heavens,   
where the holy ones abide. We find what we’re searchin’ for,   
in this world so wide, If we open up our eyes,   
we’ll see them all in stride.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
*(Verse 2)* Your smile is full of joy,   
like a god up in the sky, But the hungry ghost of greed,   
it lingers in your eyes. In the mirror of our faces,   
we see it all unfold, From the beast to the bodhisattva,   
the story’s bein’ told.  
  
*(Chorus)* Oh, we’re lookin’ for the realms,   
they’re hidin’ deep inside, From the hells to the heavens,   
where the holy ones abide. We find what we’re searchin’ for,   
in this world so wide, If we open up our eyes,   
we’ll see them all in stride.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
*(Reprise Verse 2)* Your smile is full of joy,   
like a god up in the sky, But the hungry ghost of greed,   
it lingers in your eyes. In the laughter, in the tears,   
the truth is in our soul, We’re searchin’ for the higher realms,   
where wisdom makes us whole.  
  
*(Chorus)* Oh, we’re lookin’ for the realms,   
they’re hidin’ deep inside, From the hells to the heavens,   
where the holy ones abide. We find what we’re searchin’ for,   
in this world so wide, If we open up our eyes,   
we’ll see them all in stride.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
*(Bridge)* Heaven’s not up above,   
and hell ain’t down below, They’re within this body,   
walkin’ everywhere we go. In the laughter, in the tears,   
the truth is in our soul, We’re searchin’ for the higher realms,   
where wisdom makes us whole.  
  
*(Chorus)* Oh, we’re lookin’ for the realms,   
they’re hidin’ deep inside, From the hells to the heavens,   
where the holy ones abide. We find what we’re searchin’ for,   
in this world so wide, If we open up our eyes,   
we’ll see them all in stride.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
*(Outro)*  
Yeah, we find what we’re searchin’ for,   
with the Buddha’s light in mind,  
They’re within this body,   
walkin’ everywhere we go. In the laughter, in the tears,   
the truth is in our soul, We’re searchin’ for the higher realms,   
where wisdom makes us whole.  
  
[Instrumental]  
 Yeah, we find what we’re searchin’ for,   
with the Buddha’s light in mind, The realms are in each moment,   
just waitin’ for us to find.
