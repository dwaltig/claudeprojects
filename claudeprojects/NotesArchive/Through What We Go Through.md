[Verse]  
Woke up this morning with a heavy heart  
Life's got a way to tear us apart  
But through the pain and storms we ride  
We find the strength we hold inside  
  
[Verse 2]  
Took a walk down memory lane  
Counted blessings right through the pain  
Every stumble made me see clear  
We grow stronger year by year  
  
[Chorus]  
Through what we go through we find our way  
Every night leads to a brighter day  
With every tear our roots grow deep  
Promises to keep while we sleep  
  
[Verse 3]  
Smokestacks blow a whistle loud  
Trying hard to stand out in the crowd  
Lessons learned on the winding road  
Carry heavy but we share the load  
  
[Bridge]  
Heartaches crack but they let in light  
Moments of dark that fuel our fight  
Scars we wear with a sense of pride  
Proof that we lived and we tried  
  
[Chorus]  
Through what we go through we find our way  
Every night leads to a brighter day  
With every tear our roots grow deep  
Promises to keep while we sleep  
  
[Bridge]  
Heartaches crack but they let in light  
Moments of dark that fuel our fight  
Scars we wear with a sense of pride  
Proof that we lived and we tried
