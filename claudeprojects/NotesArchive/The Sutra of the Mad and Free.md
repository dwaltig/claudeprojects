# The Sutra of the Mad and Free  
  
*A raw, howling anthem for the sacredly unhinged—where the Lotus Sutra collides with Greek mythos and Appalachian grit. Follow the outlaw pilgrim’s journey from temple exile to cosmic kinship, guided by Samantabhadra’s six-tusked elephant, Hercules’ club, and Asclepius’ half-spoken cures. Banjos duel with sitars, thunder harmonizes with mantras, and every chorus is a middle finger to dogma. For those who’ve tasted the Dharma in storm clouds and found Bodhisattvas in barroom brawls. This song mirrors the madness: crumbling temples, mirrored lotuses, and a throne built from broken precepts. The path home is paved with holy heresy.*

Lyrics:   
**Verse 1**  
*Oh, they called me crazy in the temple halls, Swore I’d lost my way. But the Buddha smiled in a thundercloud, And Hercules said, “Stay.”  
  
Samantabhadra rode his six-tusk steed, Through the cracks in Tushita’s door. “The Dharma’s a wildfire, child,” he laughed, “Burn your maps—just dance on the shore.”*  
  
**Chorus**  
*Sing the sutra of the mad and free, Where angels chew tobacco. Heaven’s just a halfway house— The real road’s paved with *“No turning back-o!”*

*Oh, they called me crazy in the temple halls, Swore I’d lost my way. But the Buddha smiled in a thundercloud, And Hercules said, “Stay.”  
  
Samantabhadra rode his six-tusk steed, Through the cracks in Tushita’s door. “The Dharma’s a wildfire, child,” he laughed, “Burn your maps—just dance on the shore.”*  
  
**Chorus**  
*Sing the sutra of the mad and free, Where angels chew tobacco. Heaven’s just a halfway house— The real road’s paved with *“No turning back-o!”*  
  
**Verse 2**  
*Asclepius whispered in a doctor’s coat, “Son, I’ll heal you blind. The cure’s in the wound that never closes— A heart cracked wide, entwined.”  
  
Akasagarbha’s lotus-throne blooms, Each petal a shattered mirror. “Your exile’s the crown,” Maitreya grinned, “The outcast’s throne is clearer.”*  
  
**Bridge**  
*The Chan master’s silence was the first chord I knew, The nuns’ scorn, the rhythm I’d borrow. Now I strum my veins like a banjo of light, And my tears tune the fiddle of sorrow.*  
  
**Outro**  
*So here’s to the liars, the saints, and the fools, Who lick the stars and chew the rules. If your God’s too small, let my madness expand— The cosmos don’t fit in the palm of your hand.*
