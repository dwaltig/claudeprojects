# Faded Love  
  
**[Verse 1]**  
Lost in your gaze, now it’s icy and cold  
Used to be warmth, now love’s getting old  
We had the fire, but it’s faded to ash  
Memories burnin’, no future to cash  
  
**[Verse 2]**  
We built our dreams, but they crumbled to dust  
Thought it was real, but it wasn’t enough  
Shadows of trust, now they linger in pain  
Heartbreak’s the game, and we lost in the rain  
  
**[Chorus]**  
Why did you leave? Now I’m here on my own  
Love disappeared, and the sadness has grown  
Faded away, like a dream that’s been killed  
Left me alone, with the emptiness filled  
  
**[Instrumental]**  
  
**[Verse 3]**  
Nights stretch too long without your embrace  
Time moving slow like it’s lost in a race  
Pain in the air, like a cloud overhead  
No turning back, from the words that were said  
  
**[Bridge]**  
Was it all worth it, the tears that we shed?  
We lost the moments, now drowning instead  
Hurt runs so deep, it’s a scar on my mind  
Was love just a phase that we left behind?  
  
**[Chorus]**  
Why did you leave? Now I’m here on my own  
Love disappeared, and the sadness has grown  
Faded away, like a dream that’s been killed  
Left me alone, with the emptiness filled  
  
**[Instrumental]**  
  
**[Bridge]**  
Was it all worth it, the tears that we shed?  
We lost the moments, now drowning instead  
Hurt runs so deep, it’s a scar on my mind  
Was love just a phase that we left behind?  
  
**[Chorus]**  
Why did you leave? Now I’m here on my own  
Love disappeared, and the sadness has grown  
Faded away, like a dream that’s been killed  
Left me alone, with the emptiness filled  
  
**[End]**
