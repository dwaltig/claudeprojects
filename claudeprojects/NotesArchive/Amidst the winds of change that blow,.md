Amidst the winds of change that blow,  
I'm grateful for the seeds I sow,  
New blessings and abundance on the way,  
Nam-Myo-ho-Ren-gay-Kyo, I say.  
   
My ideas are like stars in the night,  
Bringing hope and shining bright,  
I have the power to make them grow,  
Nam-Myo-ho-Ren-gay-Kyo, I know.  
   
The universe is vast and wide,  
But I am brave, with nothing to hide,  
My creativity flows, a constant flow,  
Nam-Myo-ho-Ren-gay-Kyo, I go.  
   
With every breath, I chant my prayer,  
And watch my dreams take shape and flair,  
I am blessed, and it clearly shows,  
Nam-Myo-ho-Ren-gay-Kyo, it glows.   
So let my spirit rise and soar,  
As I chant this mantra more and more,  
With gratitude and love, my heart aglow,  
Nam-Myo-ho-Ren-gay-Kyo, I bow.
