# Palaces of Grace — A Soulful Blues/Pop Song Inspired by the Lotus Sutra  
  
**“Palaces of Grace”** is a heartfelt Blues/Pop song inspired by Chapter Seven of the *Lotus Sutra*, where the Brahma-Heavenly-Kings offer their magnificent palaces as a profound symbol of **gratitude**, **compassion**, and **spiritual generosity**. This track beautifully explores the timeless Buddhist teaching that the merits we accumulate — whether in past lives or present moments — are not for selfish keeping but meant to be **shared with all beings**.  
  
With **warm melodies**, **bluesy undertones**, and **reflective lyrics**, “Palaces of Grace” invites listeners to move beyond feelings of scarcity, envy, and attachment. Instead, it encourages embracing **gratitude**, **generosity**, and the deep joy found in giving. The song acts as both a meditation and a celebration of the enduring power of kindness and the true beauty that arises when we open our hearts and share what we have.

**Lyrics Highlights from Palaces of Grace**  
  
Verse 1:  
Our palaces shine with gold and light,  
Built from merits earned in a past life’s night,  
We bring them here, from heaven’s gate,  
To offer you love, no time to wait.  
  
Pre-Chorus:  
Beauty and pleasure, they’re gifts we’ve known,  
But wisdom tells us, we’re not alone.  
What we have earned, we freely give,  
So all may share and learn to live.  
  
Chorus:  
Receive these palaces, built with grace,  
From the seeds of kindness in time and space.  
No need for envy, no need for pain,  
Grateful hearts will always gain.  
  
Verse 2:  
Brahma-Heavenly-Kings sing the song,  
From worlds of joy, they come along,  
To share the fruits of what they’ve done,  
In light of the One Enlightened One.  
  
Pre-Chorus:  
It’s not the having, but what we share,  
That fills the soul and clears the air.  
No matter little, no matter much,  
Gratitude’s the healing touch.  
  
Chorus:  
Receive these palaces, built with grace,  
From the seeds of kindness in time and space.  
No need for envy, no need for pain,  
Grateful hearts will always gain.  
  
Bridge:  
Let’s turn our eyes from lack to love,  
Gifts we’ve gathered from high above,  
The wisdom in this giving way,  
Lights up the night and warms the day.  
  
Final Chorus:  
Receive these palaces, built with grace,  
From the seeds of kindness in time and space.  
No need for envy, no need for pain,  
Grateful hearts will always gain.
