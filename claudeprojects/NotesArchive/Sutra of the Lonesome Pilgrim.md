Verse 1:  
On a dusty road, with my soul laid bare  
Seeking truth in a world of despair  
Ancient wisdom calls from across the sea  
The Lotus Sutra beckons to me  
  
Chorus A:  
Oh, lonesome pilgrim, hear the Dharma's call  
Every step you take, you're giving your all  
The path to enlightenment, it ain't always clear  
But the Buddha's teachings are always near  
  
Verse 2:  
In the Mississippi Delta, where the blues were born  
I heard the echoes of a spiritual dawn  
The suffering of man, like a mournful song  
Resonates with the truths I've known all along  
  
Chorus A':  
Oh, lonesome pilgrim, on this winding road  
Let the Dharma lighten your heavy load  
Every being you meet has Buddha nature inside  
In this cosmic journey, we're all along for the ride  
  
Verse 3:  
From the crossroads where old Robert Johnson stood  
To the Bodhi tree where all is understood  
The middle way between excess and lack  
Guides this weary traveler back on track  
  
Chorus A":  
Oh, lonesome pilgrim, don't you lose your way  
The Lotus Sutra teaches us every day  
Through skillful means and compassion true  
Enlightenment's path opens up for you  
  
Verse 4:  
In the realm of the Buddhas, past, present, and yet to come  
All beings are one, like the beat of a drum  
The cycle of rebirth, like a blues refrain  
Keeps on turning 'til we break the chain  
  
Chorus A''':  
Oh, lonesome pilgrim, hear the Dharma's sound  
In every heartbeat, in every town  
The Buddha's wisdom, it flows like a stream  
Awakening you from this samsaric dream  
  
Verse 5:  
The parable of the burning house rings true  
As we cling to illusions, not knowing what to do  
But the father's skillful means show the way  
To lead all beings to a brighter day  
  
Chorus A'''':  
Oh, lonesome pilgrim, open up your eyes  
The truth of emptiness, it never dies  
In the unity of all, find your peace  
Let the wisdom of the Lotus release  
  
Bridge:  
(Spoken with musical accompaniment)  
Now listen here, fellow travelers on this cosmic train  
The Lotus Sutra teaches that we're all the same  
Whether high or low, rich or poor  
We all got Buddha nature at our core  
So let's join hands and voices too  
And chant the Dharma, old and new  
  
Verse 6:  
As I reach the end of this long, long road  
My heart feels lighter, I've shed my load  
The Lotus Sutra, like a guiding light  
Has shown this pilgrim wrong from right  
  
Final Chorus:  
Oh, lonesome pilgrim, your journey's done  
In the great Dharma, we are all one  
From the Delta blues to the Eastern shore  
The Lotus wisdom opens every door  
  
(Repeat Final Chorus and fade)
