# Relational Rhythm  
  
***A contemplative folk‑blues piece that turns cosmic physics into a back‑porch hymn.***  
  
**Relational Rhythm (Gravity’s Song)** is a *cosmic folk‑blues* single by **The William Altig Choir**, blending finger‑picked acoustic guitar, slide‑guitar “spacetime bends,” and warm, soulful vocals. Inspired by Einstein’s curved spacetime and Buddhist insights into inter‑being, the track turns gravity into a groove that binds every heartbeat, star, and memory into one unfolding song. Listeners who enjoy Americana, roots blues, spiritual meditations, or artists like Iron & Wine, Ben Harper, and Jason Isbell will find a deep, reflective pocket here.  
  
Recorded at 72 BPM in the key of D minor, *Relational Rhythm* layers brushed drums, upright bass, and subtle Hammond pads beneath a baritone voice that calls us to “feel the relational rhythm, the gravity groove.” Perfect for stargazing playlists, mindful study sessions, or late‑night drives, the single invites you to slow down, breathe, and sense the unseen pulse connecting us all.

**Lyrics**  
  
**[Verse 1]**  
**Spacetime bends like an old steel string,**  
**Planets waltz where the blackbirds sing.**  
**Every footstep, every tear that falls—**  
**Pulls on the web that’s holding us all.**  
  
**[Pre‑Chorus]**  
**Feel it in the marrow, in the silent night—**  
**An unseen bass line keeping time just right.**  
  
**[Chorus]**  
**It’s the relational rhythm, the gravity groove,**  
**Tying each heartbeat to the cosmic blues.**  
**More than a weight that pulls us down,**  
**It’s the song that spins the world around.**  
  
**[Verse 2]**  
**Quarks in a dance with the distant stars,**  
**Lovers sway under neon bars.**  
**Thoughts and atoms, sorrow and grace—**  
**All keep time in the same embrace.**  
  
**[Pre‑Chorus]**  
**Close your eyes, hear the fabric creak—**  
**That’s spacetime talking in a Delta‑soul speak.**  
  
**[Chorus]**  
**It’s the relational rhythm, the gravity groove…**  
  
**[Bridge]**  
**No solo stands alone—**  
**Even silence has a tone.**  
**From black‑hole bells to a baby’s sigh,**  
**The groove runs deep, it never dies.**  
  
***(Instrumental slide‑guitar break)***  
  
**[Final Chorus]**  
**Sing that relational rhythm, gravity’s hymn,**  
**Every loss, every love, every restless whim.**  
**One unfolding piece, one interwoven song—**  
**We’ve been dancing to this pull all along.**  
  
***(Tag)***  
**Yeah, the weight that keeps us grounded**  
**Is the music that keeps us strong.**
