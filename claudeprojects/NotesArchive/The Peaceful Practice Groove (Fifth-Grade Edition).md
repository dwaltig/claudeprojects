## The Peaceful Practice Groove (Fifth-Grade Edition)  
  
**(Intro: Slow, easygoing acoustic guitar riff—simple, warm, and inviting.)**  
  
**(Verse 1)**   
(Am) Woke up this mornin', saw the big, wide world,   
(G) Too many boxes, too many flags unfurled. (  
C) **No gate to guard, no high shelf to climb,**   
(F) 'Cause all the ways of learnin' get there at the same time.   
(Am) A thousand names just fade like smoke in the air,   
(E7) **My breath's a bridge** to everyone, everywhere.  
  
**(Chorus)**   
(Am) Oh, the **Peaceful Practice Groove**—it keeps rollin' slow,   
(G) Every single person gets to where they gotta go.   
(C) Drop the proud kite, let its pretty wings fold down,   
(F) We're all on the same street in the very same town.   
(Am) **No judging, no labeling**, that's the golden rule,   
(E7) Walkin' the world in fearless peace, yeah, that’s super cool.  
  
**(Verse 2)**   
(Am) Used to worry if the world was real or a simple dream,   
(G) Tryna grab onto things in the fast-moving stream.   
(C) But the world’s a constant change, like the clouds that float on by,   
(F) **Cause and effect** are tied together, under one big sky.   
(Am) Don't grab onto nothin', don't call it "mine,"   
(E7) You stop bein' a bossy-boots when you drop the line.  
  
**(Chorus)**   
(Am) Oh, the **Peaceful Practice Groove**—it keeps rollin' slow,   
(G) Every single person gets to where they gotta go.   
(C) Drop the proud kite, let its pretty wings fold down,   
(F) We're all on the same street in the very same town.   
(Am) **No judging, no labeling**, that's the golden rule,   
(E7) Walkin' the world in fearless peace, yeah, that’s super cool.  
  
**(Bridge)**   
(Dm) Now I see no **"man" or "woman,"** just a friendly face,   
(Am) **No separate box** in this big, open space.   
(G) The **know-it-all** fades, and **curiosity** comes in,   
(C) Openin' up new doors where the good times begin.   
(E7) **No need to conquer, no will to rule**, we're all interwoven streams,   
(Am) **Understanding** answers every call; that’s how the good life seems.  
  
**(Instrumental Break: Short, simple, positive melody on a ukulele, slide guitar, or piano, keeping the beat steady.)**  
  
**(Outro)**   
(Am) Yeah, walk the world in fearless peace, a flame that won't give out.   
(G) **Each step a promise, no reason to shout.**   
(Am) Teachin' by simply **lettin' be**...   
(E7) ...Just lettin' be.   
(Am) The Peaceful Practice Groove...  
  
**(End on a final, resonant, positive Am chord.)**
