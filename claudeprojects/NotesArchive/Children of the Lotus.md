# Children of the Lotus  
  
Beneath the dawn's awakening light,   
They set aside their toys of play,   
Their hearts aflame with pure delight,   
To seek the Buddha's Middle Way.  
  
"Expound the Dharma!" clear they cry,   
"Reveal the truth that sets souls free!   
Grant us the wisdom from on high   
That shows what we're all born to be."  
  
Before their father, wise and known,   
They bowed with minds like waters clear.   
No worldly treasures would they own,   
But truth they sought, both far and near.  
  
"If we may reach that lotus shore   
Where Buddhahood awaits within,   
Then others too, forevermore,   
May find the peace where truths begin."  
  
Such noble thought from souls so young!  
Such vast compassion, boundless, true!  
The self's illusion they've outgrown  
To help all beings break through.  
  
While others walk in suffering's sway,  
Caught in the wheel of endless turns,  
These children show the gentle way  
Where wisdom's lamp eternal burns.  
  
So may we, like these children fair,   
Relinquish all that binds and blinds,   
And see the truth already there   
Within our ever-present minds.  
  
The Dharma's light, a lotus bloom,   
Unfolds within each sentient heart.   
Dispelling every shade of gloom,   
Where all are Buddhas from the start.  
  
The path unfolds for all who seek,   
For high and low, for old and young.   
The Buddha's wisdom, strong yet meek,   
Is perfect in each being sung.
