**Lyrics:**  
[Verse]  
Should I brand it apocalypse?  
It's an insom-ni-acal-ly lit kind of dream  
An insomni-acal-ly-lotted stream starting to intersperse with reality  
The right side of hype versus the left of regularity  
At the tip of the branch  
I barely damned damsels in distress  
That test teeth on my Achilles foot  
that stills wheel  
Fresh off the lip  
frisky fingertips speak just in the nick of time  
Tree leaves start feeling prime meridian tension as she approaches  
High noon full of cackle  
and babble on the babble on in toe tip  
spirals towards the other way  
Arms poised and pointed  
Masked by a stone cold smile  
Can't be bothered cold shoulder to water  
Shunned me from even carrying one bean  
  
[Chorus]  
Anticipate what happens overnight  
Anticipate what happens overnight  
And is that even possible? (Is it even possible?)  
  
[Verse]  
Half asleep I undo  
Antidream deeds reborn into  
a non-salvageable state of being  
be for-warned  
I place what's sworn on a black unicorn  
born back born  
therewith horn  
Poked  
Penetrate  
Prevent reincarnation of another planet I bet  
flipped in a fifth  
Fraction of a tenth  
I shimmy flip reverse semantics  
Forgettin' antics of insight  
discarded beforehand  
Blessed with the heresy of apparent self-success  
Each thread (unties, betrays) tethers me to a test  
Named humanity  
A breath away from  
same canal  
She canvases with a blind brush  
with the bastardisation  
But instead do another vanish  
rather than clarion call  
  
[Chorus]  
Anticipate what happens overnight  
Anticipate what happens overnight  
And is that even possible?  
  
[Verse]  
Indistinguishable from the now  
Not impossible it could be fore-vow  
From a concentration camp we kept fuelling her  
Feeding her  
Freed like an old Freddy dream  
or disco queened into an ego machine  
Isis binding brother to sleep  
Coiling fathoms beneath lih-leth the sheet  
Would've rather tucked odins other I underneath  
If I truly know that he's likely to lose it again  
But yet again  
we are here at
