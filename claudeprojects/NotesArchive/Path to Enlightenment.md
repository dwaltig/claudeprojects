[Verse 1]  
In the stillness of the night we find  
A path that leads to inner peace  
With open hearts and focused mind  
Towards the light, our souls release  
  
[Verse 2]  
Trust in wisdom, clear and bright  
Follow the truths that resonate and bold  
To inner freedom, with all our might  
In the truth, our spirits hold  
  
[Chorus]  
Rejecting shadows, doubts, and fears  
We journey on, the light appears  
With inner wisdom shining bright  
We walk this path through the darkest night  
  
[Verse 3]  
Each step we take with gentle grace  
Awakening our soul's true aim  
In this journey, we embrace  
The gleaming truth, forever aflame  
  
[Bridge]  
Dedication, our guide so true  
In every word and deed we find  
Purpose in what we pursue  
Unleashing the power within our mind  
  
[Chorus]  
Rejecting shadows, doubts, and fears  
We journey on, the light appears  
With inner wisdom shining bright  
We walk this path through the darkest night
