# Merit’s Quiet Bloom  
  
Merit is not golden coins,  
nor treasures vast and rare,  
but whispers of compassion  
floating softly in the air.  
  
In smiles that greet the stranger,  
in patience calmly worn,  
merit grows unseen, unheard—  
a blossom gently born.  
  
Merit rests in joyful hearts  
that hear and share the Truth,  
passing wisdom’s quiet flame,  
illuminating youth.  
  
Not in temples built of stone,  
nor praise from crowds above;  
but in humble acts of grace,  
kindness clothed in love.  
  
In silent deeds that ripple far,  
through chains of hearts entwined,  
merit travels endlessly,  
a thread of gold refined.  
  
Every seed of kindness sown,  
every Dharma word that’s said,  
plants the roots of radiant joy,  
through countless lifetimes spread.  
  
Rejoice then in the quiet bloom,  
that merit softly brings—  
it shelters souls in storms of life,  
on gentle, boundless wings.

From wholesome deeds, a gentle rain,  
A force called merit starts to gain 1.  
Not just reward, a deeper root,  
A positive and fruitful shoot 1.  
Through giving heart and virtuous way,  
And minds that learn and grow each day 1,  
This unseen strength begins to bloom,  
Dispelling shadows, chasing gloom 1.  
Like lights upon a Christmas tree,  
It shows the Dharma, clear to see 4.  
A karmic wealth, a precious store,  
That opens happiness's door 1.  
And when we share this gentle grace,  
With open hearts, in time and space 3,  
Its blessings flow, a boundless stream,  
Fulfilling life's most cherished dream 3.  
To hear the Dharma, to impart,  
Adds merit to the listening heart 8.  
Rejoicing in the good we find,  
Leaves trails of merit in the mind 3.  
So let us strive with purpose true,  
In thought and word and action too 3,  
To cultivate this precious might,  
And walk towards the purest light 1.
