# In The Time Of Decline  
  
Verse 1  
In a time of decline, when truth’s in the shade,  
The Seeker rises up, never afraid.  
Teachings corrupted, voices get twisted,  
But the Seeker stays true, uplifted, persistent.  
  
No hate in their heart, no judgment, no fight,  
Respect for all who walk towards the light.  
Uniting the Awakened, the seekers too,  
Creating a path for the many, not the few.  
  
Chorus  
The Seeker stands strong in a world that’s divided,  
Guiding the lost where the truth is provided.  
No bias, no slant, just the purest of truth,  
They bring the wisdom to preserve what’s been loosed.  
In times of decline, they shine like the dawn,  
The seeker of spirit, where the teachings live on.  
  
Verse 2  
Fair with the words, every lesson’s intact,  
Impartial delivery, no room for distract.  
No personal spin, no selfish aim,  
Just keeping it real, staying true to the flame.  
  
With those who listen, they form a tribe,  
Nurturing souls with that spiritual vibe.  
Even when teachings are fading away,  
The Seeker’s voice echoes, leading the way.  
  
Chorus  
The Seeker stands strong in a world that’s divided,  
Guiding the lost where the truth is provided.  
No bias, no slant, just the purest of truth,  
They bring the wisdom to preserve what’s been loosed.  
In times of decline, they shine like the dawn,  
The seeker of spirit, where the teachings live on.  
  
Bridge  
In the chaos, the noise, where confusion reigns,  
The Seeker remains calm, cutting through chains.  
A beacon of hope, in the dark of the night,  
Preserving the Dharma, carrying the light.  
  
They honor the path, every step that they take,  
For those in the dark, they make no mistake.  
With the seekers united, the lineage survives,  
A force of compassion, keeping hope alive.  
  
Chorus  
The Seeker stands strong in a world that’s divided,  
Guiding the lost where the truth is provided.  
No bias, no slant, just the purest of truth,  
They bring the wisdom to preserve what’s been loosed.  
In times of decline, they shine like the dawn,  
The seeker of spirit, where the teachings live on.
