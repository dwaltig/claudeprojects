The Open Window of Altruism: A Lotus Sutra Epiphany  
  
He chose to live a life far grander than self-pursuit,  
Aware that solitary happiness breeds fears, renders one mute.  
Those who dwell in self-centered desires, develop hearts of stone,  
Encased in shells of futile egotism, they languish alone.  
  
Yet, he chose the path of Kosen-rufu, the way to harmony,  
Cultivating solid faith, he vowed to set all beings free.  
A spirit forged not in isolation, but in collective resilience,  
Choosing to open his heart, he embraced the world's brilliance.  
  
No longer enclosed within self-serving walls, he began to see,  
The truth of altruism, the path to universal gaiety.  
For it is through the wide open window of selflessness,  
That the radiant rays of the sun freely express.  
  
No light can penetrate the fortress of selfish desires,  
It is altruism that kindles the world's transformative fires.  
Through this open window, hope and warmth freely dance,  
Filling every corner, every crevice, with the light of enhanced chance.  
  
In the shadows of self, we find only doubt and despair,  
But in the light of altruism, we find strength beyond compare.  
And so, he chose to live for others, for their joy and release,  
Knowing it's through shared happiness, we find our true peace.
