To shed further light on this subject, the Enlightened One spoke the following verses on that occasion:  
  
Displaying charity's might with care,  
Compassion's embrace for all to share,  
The Sugatas affirm with gentle stare,  
This exalted Sūtra, rich and rare.  
  
Laymen, friars, seekers at time's end,  
Embrace charity's strength, do not contend,  
Lest the law's rejection they portend,  
Its wisdom's embrace they must defend.  
  
When enlightenment's reached, in glory I'll stand,  
As Tathāgata's wisdom fills the land,  
I'll initiate others, take them by hand,  
Preaching superior light, as love has planned.  
  
A king of armies, his joy to unspool,  
Rewards his soldiers, each brave and cool,  
Gold, elephants, horses, cities – his jewel,  
A token of contentment, his ruling tool.  
  
Hand-ornaments, silver, gold thread bestowed,  
Pearls, gems, conch-shells, gifts overflowed,  
Slaves of various kinds, satisfaction showed,  
His pleasure in them, he brightly glowed.  
  
But when one soldier's daring does shine,  
The king declares, "This act is divine!"  
He gives his crown, "This jewel is thine,"  
A gift incomparable, a symbol fine.  
  
I, the Buddha, the law's noble king,  
With patience's force, wisdom's bright wing,  
Govern the world, compassion's soft ring,  
Benign and pitiful, to all I bring.  
  
Seeing creatures in trouble, their strife and toil,  
I pronounce teachings, wisdom's sweet oil,  
Heroism of beings, pure minds that foil,  
Sinful inclinations, the world's dark soil.  
  
The king of the law, physician great,  
Expounds countless teachings, opens the gate,  
Recognizing strength, he does not hesitate,  
Shows this Sūtra, a crown jewel's weight.  
  
This last Sūtra, proclaimed and true,  
Eminent among teachings, bright in hue,  
Always kept secret, known to a few,  
Now I reveal; listen, a wisdom new.  
  
Four qualities must be embraced,  
By those who seek enlightenment's grace,  
In time's decay, with steadfast face,  
To perform my charge and win the race.  
  
The wise one's vexation knows no sway,  
No trouble, sickness, nor dark array,  
Skin not blackish, town not gray,  
In joyful dwellings, they find their way.  
  
The great Sage shines with a look so dear,  
Honored as Tathāgata, drawing near,  
Little angels attend with cheer,  
His presence revered, his path is clear.  
  
His body untouched by weapon or ill,  
Poison, sticks, clods, can't break his will,  
Abuse against him is silenced still,  
His aura of peace, a tranquil thrill.  
  
A friend to all, his light roams wide,  
Dissipating gloom, no shadow to hide,  
Many creatures' hearts open and abide,  
In his Sūtra's glow, where truths reside.  
  
In dreams, he sees visions of Buddha's embrace,  
Monks and nuns in thrones, wisdom's trace,  
Proclaiming the law with gentle grace,  
The multi-sided truth, time's endless chase.  
  
Gods and goblins in dreams abound,  
Demons and Nâgas, all gather round,  
Hands lifted high, in awe they're found,  
To his eminent law, they're spellbound.  
  
Dreaming of Tathāgata, preaching the way,  
Golden and glorious, in bright array,  
Many beings hearken to words that sway,  
The law's sweet song, in hearts it'll stay.  
  
With joined hands, he glorifies the Seer,  
The highest of men, the path made clear,  
The Jina, great physician, drawing near,  
Expounding to classes, with voices sincere.  
  
Glad to have heard, joy fills his core,  
Worshiping wisdom, seeking ever more,  
Knowledge unshaken, spells to explore,  
In dreams he attains, what hearts adore.  
  
The Lord of the world, with eyes so keen,  
Perceives the intent, pure and serene,  
"Young one of good heart, a leader you'll be,  
Supreme knowledge you'll reach, just wait and see."  
  
"A large field you'll have, four classes to teach,  
Respectful they'll listen to your heartfelt speech,  
The vast, faultless law, they'll hear from your lips,  
With hands joined together, on wisdom's sweet trips."  
  
In dreams, he meditates, mountain caverns his seat,  
Attains the law's nature, insight so sweet,  
Complete absorption, the Jina he sees,  
A vision of gold, a soul at ease.  
  
In dreams, he hears the law, the gold-colored one,  
A hundred signs hallowed, the journey's begun,  
He preaches the assembly, his words taking flight,  
Such is his dream, in wisdom's pure light.  
  
In dreams, he forsakes realms, harem, and kin,  
Renouncing all pleasures, ascetic life to begin,  
To the terrace of enlightenment, he takes his way,  
A throne at the foot of a tree, where he'll stay.  
  
Seven days seeking, enlightenment's embrace,  
Knowledge of Tathāgatas, he'll surely trace,  
The wisdom he'll find, a treasure so rare,  
A journey of mind, beyond all compare.  
  
Rising to move the faultless wheel forward,  
Preaching the law, with truth's resonant chord,  
Inconceivable ages, his teachings will last,  
A beacon of light, through time's boundless vast.  
  
Revealing perfection, leading many to rest,  
A lamp extinguished, when oil's not its best,  
So is that vision, so pure and so bright,  
A path to enlightenment, through wisdom's true light.  
  
Endless, Mañjusri, the gains ever flow,  
For one who expounds this Sūtra, with wisdom to show,  
Superior enlightenment, perfectly clear,  
At time's distant end, drawing ever near.  
At time's distant end, drawing ever near.

Creating storyboards for the concluding verses of Chapter 14 from "The Lotus of the True Law" offers a unique opportunity to visually interpret and enhance the text's profound themes. Here are suggestions and guidance for each of the nine scenes:  
  
1. **Buddha Sharing Wisdom**: Focus on the expressions and postures of the listeners to convey their reverence and engagement. Use soft, warm colors to create a peaceful atmosphere. Place the Buddha centrally, perhaps slightly elevated, to signify his role as the teacher. Experiment with gentle lighting to highlight the Buddha and create a sense of focus.  
  
2. **Metaphor of the King and Soldiers**: Emphasize the richness and variety of the gifts to symbolize the depth of the Buddha's teachings. The king should have a benevolent, generous demeanor. Consider using perspective to show the vast number of soldiers, suggesting the extensive reach of the Buddha's influence.  
  
3. **Diverse Beings Receiving the Law**: This scene should be vibrant and diverse. Include various mythical creatures and humans, each portrayed with unique features but united in their attention to the Buddha. Play with scale and positioning to create a dynamic, engaging composition.  
  
4. **Dream Visions of Enlightenment**: Use surreal, dreamlike imagery with a golden aura to convey a sense of otherworldliness. The Buddha might be depicted in an ethereal, almost translucent manner. Soft, blurred edges and a glowing background can enhance the dreamlike quality.  
  
5. **Journey to Asceticism**: Show the protagonist leaving behind symbols of worldly life (wealth, family, etc.). The path ahead should be clear but not entirely defined, symbolizing the unknown journey of spiritual discovery. Muted colors can convey the seriousness of this commitment.  
  
6. **Meditation and Insight**: For a tranquil scene, use cool, calming colors. The protagonist should be in a deep state of meditation, possibly with symbolic elements like a serene landscape or faint images of enlightened beings in the background to suggest the insights being gained.  
  
7. **The Buddha as a Healer**: Portray the Buddha with a compassionate expression, reaching out or touching those in need. The beings receiving healing can show varied reactions – some of relief, others of newfound understanding. Use warm, healing colors to reinforce the theme.  
  
8. **Preaching to the Assembly**: Focus on the engagement between the protagonist and the audience. The protagonist should be portrayed confidently, with an open, inviting posture. The audience can be shown in various states of revelation and awe.  
  
9. **Path of Enlightenment**: A path leading towards a bright, inviting light can symbolically represent enlightenment. The path should be inviting yet not entirely straightforward, indicating the journey's challenges and rewards. Use light and shadow to create depth and interest.  
  
Remember, these scenes should not only illustrate the text but also evoke emotions and deeper understanding in the viewer. Pay attention to details like facial expressions, body language, and environmental elements to enrich the narrative and convey the profound messages of the Sutra.
