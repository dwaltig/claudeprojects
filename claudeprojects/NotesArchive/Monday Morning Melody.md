[Verse]  
Wake up greet the day  
Light creeps in to stay  
Coffee warms the soul  
Lost in saxophone's roll  
  
[Verse 2]  
Rhythm takes me high  
Notes that touch the sky  
Sunshine breaking through  
Morning starts with a view  
  
[Chorus]  
Sax sings through the dawn  
Turn the blues all gone  
Melodies so bright  
Makes everything feel right  
  
[Verse 3]  
Echoes in my mind  
Leave the worries behind  
Morning breeze so cool  
Music's gentle rule  
  
[Verse 4]  
Different worlds collide  
In this morning stride  
Every note a gift  
Feel the spirits lift  
  
[Chorus]  
Sax sings through the dawn  
Turn the blues all gone  
Melodies so bright  
Makes everything feel right  
Makes everything feel right  
  
[Reprise Verse 3]  
[Reprise Verse 3]  
[Reprise Verse 3]  
[Reprise Verse 3]  
Echoes in my mind  
Leave the worries behind  
Morning breeze so cool  
Music's gentle rule  
Music's gentle rule  
  
[Chorus]  
Sax sings through the dawn  
Turn the blues all gone  
Melodies so bright  
Makes everything feel righ
