There are those powerful moments in life which present opportunities to make progress. Everything is in a state of flux, ready to establish a direction either towards change and improvement, or towards stagnation. It is the moment we have been preparing for, and although it seems too big for our capabilities, if we concentrate all our energies on being conscientious and correct, we will win the help we need to conquer the difficulties.

Because the "weight of the great is excessive," the danger exists that we may lose our inner equilibrium. Our inferiors tend to become alarmed, trying to identify and anticipate the situation. They produce an energy to react. If they succeed, firmness goes too far and becomes hardness, withdrawal becomes retaliation, or sincerity in persevering turns to ambition to overcome the situation with sweeping effort. In all these cases, the ego has intruded at the first perception of the 11 situation," and threatens to collapse the ridgepole of our will to persevere. We must regain modesty through the effort to rid ourself of strong elements that cause us to press forward.

The strong elements may exist in someone else, causing them to assault us with their fear, mistrust or doubt. Strong refers to impetuous movement to resolve what is ambiguous. Being thus assaulted, we also feel pressure to forgo modesty and non-action. The weight of the great bears heavily. We can meet the challenge by remaining detached and letting things go through their changes. We can be content to let our way of life penetrate slowly, without pressure, explaining or demonstrating, allowing healing and attraction to occur naturally. To be truly rich is to remain modest; to be truly powerful is to remain reticent. This is what it means to achieve real superiority over the situation.

Here, the renewal of the relationship fails because we have not yet resolved the misunderstandings that originally disrupted it. All appears well on the surface, and each person tries to relate property, but the basis for renewal is not adequate. To take advantage of our good work before the results have become firmly established is to cause progress to collapse.

The images of thunder and wind, as elements which always accompany each other, symbolize relationships which endure. Marriage, for example, is the enduring relationship between the sexes. This hexagram also specifies the attitudes that lead to steadiness in our path, and the creative result that comes of being steady, in spite of challenges. The example given is of the "Holy Man" who, by remaining "forever in his course," enables the world to reshape itself.
