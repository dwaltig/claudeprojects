**Verse 1** I’ve walked through the fire, I’ve weathered the storm, Practiced my virtues, tried to keep warm. Charity, patience, and a heart full of grace, But nothing compares to that moment of faith.  
  
**Chorus** Oh, just a moment of faith, it’s all I need, A spark in the darkness, a seed in the weeds. The Buddha’s long life, it’s a truth so divine, One moment of trust, and the stars align.  
  
**Verse 2** I’ve given my all, for ages untold, Built monasteries, offered silver and gold. But the merit of faith, it outshines the rest, A single belief, and I’m truly blessed.  
  
**Chorus** Oh, just a moment of faith, it’s all I need, A spark in the darkness, a seed in the weeds. The Buddha’s long life, it’s a truth so divine, One moment of trust, and the stars align.  
  
**Bridge** Doubt and fear, they try to take hold, But faith’s a light that never grows old. Through endless cycles, I’ll find my way, With faith in my heart, I’ll see the day.  
  
**Outro** So I’ll sit on the terrace, and I’ll roar like a lion, With faith as my guide, and wisdom my Zion. One moment of trust, and the path is clear, The virtue of faith, it’s always near.
