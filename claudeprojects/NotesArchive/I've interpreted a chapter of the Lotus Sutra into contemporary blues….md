I've interpreted a chapter of the Lotus Sutra into contemporary blues vernacular as part of a larger trilogy. I'm seeking a Buddhist scholar—ideally with training in Classical Chinese and knowledge of Kumārajīva's translation—to review one sample chapter and give me honest assessment of whether I've maintained doctrinal accuracy and fidelity to the original teaching. This is not about whether you like the work. It's about whether the interpretation serves authentic dharma transmission. If interested, please DM me.
