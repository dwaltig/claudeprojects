Truly grateful for this opportunity.  My name is William. Mr Altig, to my students. I'm a teacher and tutor by trade  
  
I first came to Chung Tai in 2005  
During My first meditation I listened to the birds. I later realized it was the most calming experience.   
Afterwards, my spouse and I went to the Mall. I didn't feel so anxious. Surrounded by so many strangers. But the stable calmness remained.   
I attended all the levels, and sought to understand their practical meaning  
  
I learned by taking faith/practicing the Dharma I changed my life for the better.   
  
Prior, I lived what I perceived was a wretched life, unhappy and angry. Today, I live the most fulfilling life.   
This school opened my eyes to wonderful possibilities. For this I'm eternally grateful. But I wanted to lean the truth and that path took me elsewhere.   
  
My heart gladdened, by continuing to strengthen my practice I discovered within an unlimited source of  
Joy, courage, tranquility, patience, love, hope, faith, all the Noble qualities of a worthy son of  the Buddha, and I continue to cultivate these states.   
  
I hope to be your Noble friend. One that will help strengthen your enlightened qualities and  encourage you to help others to do the same.   
  
Simily  
We are in a burning house. We are distracted by our toys and games. Our father is pleading to us to escape, he knows we're ignorant of our situation. There is but one door. He is offering us even greater games to play once we achieve safety by his side.   
Liberate yourselves  
Achieve your truth
