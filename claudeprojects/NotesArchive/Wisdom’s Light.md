In the heart of the Sutra,  
wisdom’s light we see,  
To expound its sacred verses,  
to set our spirit free.  
With every word and teaching,  
the Buddha’s face appears,  
In the silent echoes of our hearts,  
his presence calms our fears.  
his presence calms our fears.

[Chorus]  
In the light of the Sutra,  
we find our way back home,  
With the Buddha’s wisdom,  
we know we’re not alone.  
Through the cosmic dance of Dharma,  
we see the stars align,  
With the Lotus blooming in our hearts,  
we let our spirits shine.  
we let our spirits shine.

Many-Treasures Tathāgata,  
eternal truth revealed,  
In the sutra’s timeless pages,  
his essence is unsealed.  
Buddhas in countless realms,  
across the cosmic sea,  
Reflections of enlightenment,  
boundless unity.  
boundless unity.  
  
[Chorus]  
In the light of the Sutra,  
we find our way back home,  
With the Buddha’s wisdom,  
we know we’re not alone.  
Through the cosmic dance of Dharma,  
we see the stars align,  
With the Lotus blooming in our hearts,  
we let our spirits shine.  
we let our spirits shine.

To teach this Sutra,  
a path both deep and wide,  
Attunes the soul to mysteries  
where countless truths abide.  
In the interconnected web,  
of beings near and far,  
We find the Buddha’s presence,  
in each and every star.  
in each and every star.  
  
[Chorus]  
In the light of the Sutra,  
we find our way back home,  
With the Buddha’s wisdom,  
we know we’re not alone.  
Through the cosmic dance of Dharma,  
we see the stars align,  
With the Lotus blooming in our hearts,  
we let our spirits shine.  
we let our spirits shine.

Thus, by sharing wisdom,  
we join the cosmic dance,  
Awakening to the Dharma,  
in every fleeting glance.  
Transforming hearts and minds,  
with compassion’s gentle art,  
The Lotus blooms within us,  
as we play our noble part.  
as we play our noble part.
