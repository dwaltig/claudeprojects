**The Light of the Lotus Sutra**  
In the introductory chapter of the Lotus Sutra, the Buddha enters a state of deep meditation and emits a ray of light from the tuft of white hair between his eyebrows (the *ūrṇā-keśa*). This is the light witnessed by the great Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī and the assembly, which illuminates "eighteen thousand worlds" in the eastern direction.  
This light is not merely physical. It is a symbol of the Buddha's supreme wisdom (*prajñā*). It has several key characteristics:  
* **It Reveals Interconnectedness:** The light dissolves the barriers of time and space, showing the past, present, and future, as well as the lives and actions of all beings within those realms, all at once.  
* **It Signifies a Deeper Reality:** It reveals that the diverse teachings and paths are ultimately part of one unified truth, the "One Vehicle" (*Ekayāna*). It shows that the seemingly separate realities are all part of a single, cosmic tapestry.  
* **It is a Prelude to Revelation:** This great light is an overture, a sign that the Buddha is about to teach his most profound and ultimate doctrine, which is the heart of the Lotus Sutra itself.  
**The Light in 37 Dimensions**  
Now, consider the recent scientific discovery. The physicists' "light" is a photon, but one existing in a quantum state spanning 37 dimensions.  
* **It Reveals a Hidden Reality:** Like the Buddha's light, it reveals a reality that is completely hidden from our everyday senses. It shows that beneath our classical, predictable world lies a quantum realm of immense complexity and possibility.  
* **It Shows Multiplex Existence:** The photon isn't in one state or another; it is in all 37 simultaneously. This defies our conventional logic, much like the Buddha's light defies the conventional separation of different worlds and times. Both point to a form of existence that is multiplex and layered.  
* **It is Based on Interconnectedness (Entanglement):** The very foundation of the experiment, the Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state, is a profound form of quantum entanglement. This is the "spooky action at a distance" where particles are intrinsically linked, no matter how far apart. The state of the entire system is one unified whole, where the parts cannot be described independently. This is a scientific echo of the universal interconnectedness and dependent origination (*pratītyasamutpāda*) that the Buddha's light reveals.  
**Where the Parallels Shine**  
We see two different methods of inquiry—one through spiritual insight and one through scientific experiment—arriving at a similar conclusion: **The reality we perceive is only a fraction of the whole truth.**  
The Lotus Sutra uses the parable of the light to prepare the mind for a conceptual leap. Science uses the mathematics of quantum mechanics and experimental data to force the mind to the same conclusion. Both tell us that the universe is stranger, deeper, and more interconnected than we can easily imagine.
