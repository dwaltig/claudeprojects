# The Bodhi Tree Within  
  
In an age of dust and noise,  
where old roads crack and kings forget,  
the Eternal Voice whispers—  
*You are not small, nor late.*  
  
The Buddha is not a fading star,  
but a sun without horizon,  
rising through the marrow  
of those who keep the wondrous law.  
  
Sit, friend, beneath the tree already grown inside you.  
The place you stand is holy ground,  
each breath a living stūpa,  
each step a consecrated vow.  
  
No kalpas to count, no distant eon to wait—  
cause and fruit flower in a single moment.  
Recite, read, embrace the Sutra’s song,  
and you have already crossed the ocean of becoming.  
  
Persecution may howl like a midnight wind,  
but it only proves the vow’s bright edge.  
Hatred and jealousy cannot drown  
a heart invincible as Maitreya’s name.  
  
Every pebble, blade of grass, and flicker of mind  
rings with Buddha-nature.  
The Dharma-kāya is your own body,  
the Infinite Lifespan your breath.  
  
Rise, courageous votary—  
a Bodhisattva in our midst.  
The world of conflict is your temple,  
and every act of patient love  
is the roar of the Lion’s wisdom.
