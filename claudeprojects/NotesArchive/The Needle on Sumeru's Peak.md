# The Needle on Sumeru's Peak  
  
Imagine Sumeru, vast and high,  
A cosmic pillar in the sky.  
Upon its peak, a needle stands,  
Unseen by distant, seeking hands.  
  
From far-off peak, another twin,  
Where howling winds of chance begin,  
A single thread is cast in air,  
A fleeting hope, a whispered prayer.  
  
To thread that needle, lost to sight,  
Blown by the gales of day and night –  
Impossibility defined,  
A task to break the strongest mind.  
  
Yet Nichiren, with wisdom deep,  
Revealed a truth for us to keep:  
More rare than thread through needle's eye,  
Beneath a vast and windy sky,  
  
Is hearing, knowing, chanting forth  
The Mystic Law's transforming worth.  
To touch the Lotus, heart and soul,  
To make our fractured spirit whole.  
  
Myoho Renge Kyo – the sound,  
Where treasure, boundless, can be found.  
Five syllables, a universe,  
That can life's deepest ills reverse.  
  
We strive, achieve, and often find  
Our triumphs commonplace of mind.  
We see the lack, forget the grace,  
The fortune shining in this place.  
  
But think upon that windswept thread,  
The words the Daishonin has said.  
This chant we voice, this Law we hold,  
More precious far than gems or gold.  
  
It is the fruit of ages past,  
Good fortune built, designed to last.  
A blind man seeing parents dear,  
Cannot compare to joy held here.  
  
So chant with thanks, let hearts perceive  
The wondrous blessing we receive.  
The path to Buddhahood, revealed,  
Our truest nature unconcealed.  
  
On Sumeru's peak, the needle waits,  
But harder still were Dharma's gates.  
Yet now they're open, clear, and wide,  
With Myoho Renge Kyo inside.
