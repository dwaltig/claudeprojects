Verse 1  
Well, the children were a-sufferin', poison in their veins,  
Lost in the darkness, chained by their pains.  
The old man came home, with a cure in his hand,  
But some turned away, couldn't understand.  
  
Chorus  
Oh, the medicine's sweet, but the mind's gone astray,  
Can't see the light, though it's bright as the day.  
The wise physician cries, "Take what I give,"  
But the poisoned heart don't know how to live.  
  
Verse 2  
He said, "This here medicine, it's good and it's true,  
It'll heal your soul, make you whole, make you new."  
Some took it gladly, their faith was strong,  
But others just doubted, said, "Something feels wrong."  
  
Chorus  
Oh, the medicine's sweet, but the mind's gone astray,  
Can't see the light, though it's bright as the day.  
The wise physician cries, "Take what I give,"  
But the poisoned heart don't know how to live.  
  
Bridge  
Delusion's a river, it runs deep and wide,  
Blinds every eye, turns the truth to a lie.  
But the father keeps callin', his love never fades,  
Even for the lost ones, lost in the shade.  
  
Verse 3  
Now the ones who took the cure, they walk in the sun,  
Their battles are over, their freedom is won.  
But the others still wander, in shadows they stay,  
Too proud to reach out, too scared to pray.  
  
Chorus  
Oh, the medicine's sweet, but the mind's gone astray,  
Can't see the light, though it's bright as the day.  
The wise physician cries, "Take what I give,"  
But the poisoned heart don't know how to live.  
  
Outro  
So if you're feelin' lost, and the world's gone cold,  
There's a cure for the poison, a hand to hold.  
Don't let your doubt keep you chained to the night,  
Step into the healing, step into the light.
