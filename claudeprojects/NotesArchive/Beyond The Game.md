**Lyrics: **  
[Verse]  
Unlocks for all the mystery  
With wisdom's key no guarantee  
Sees all laws one and the same  
Unbound by fame without a name  
  
[Verse 2]  
In darkness and in light he sees  
True rest beyond life's shaky seas  
No claim to make no flag to wave  
He finds a peace we all do crave  
  
[Chorus]  
Hear the sage in every sound  
Wisdom's whispers all around  
Beyond the game we all must play  
Feel the light chase night away  
  
[Verse 3]  
Unlit paths he walks with ease  
No need for maps through life's trapeze  
A silent guide within his heart  
Shows him how to stand apart  
  
[Bridge]  
In storms and calm he stands so still  
Knowing life bends to his will  
No throne no crown no need to reign  
He teaches us to break the chain  
  
[Chorus]  
Hear the sage in every sound  
Wisdom's whispers all around  
Beyond the game we all must play  
Feel the light chase night away
