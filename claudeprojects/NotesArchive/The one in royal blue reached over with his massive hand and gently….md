The one in royal blue reached over with his massive hand and gently stroked me from my pec down my right leg. He wanted to feel the hardness of my body and softness of my skin. I gave in to the fact my exposed dick was full, hard, and pointed upward. They seemed thrilled and I smiled back at them, excited despite my uncertainty and anxiety. I enjoyed being touched and wanted the superman to do it more. To them, they hit the jackpot. Those three giant musclemen craved nothing more than to kiss, cuddle and fuck me there on the spot. Despite their overwhelming interest, they were restrained, and I remained unsure, still a patient on a hospital bed, or a prisoner at their mercy. Little did I know they were a small part of a larger plan, and there was much more in store. In retrospect, I now realize they were an advance crew of scientist-physicians who evaluated those brought through a wormhole to their world. They were there to determine if the humans coming through met their target criteria. If so, they would act as ‘hosts’ to the ‘traveler’.

The initial evaluation at the lab also mined my genetic material to integrate it into their reproductive process. Their objective here was to enhance their genetic diversity. Varied human gene stock was guaranteed by their focus on gay men influenced by sthenolagnia, or muscle worship, being the sexual attraction to the display of strength or male muscular development. This attraction cuts across most human cultures and influences both gay men and heterosexual women but is not often expressed openly by Earthmen. However, it was behavior the Xzardans were able to zero in on through their technology. Returning to Earth was impossible. The wormhole I came through went in one direction and we were half a universe away. However, this world carefully selected targets through observation to find the most compatible candidates to avoid ‘mistakes’, and waste resources. Recently, they became better at remote observation and targeting. They could also access any electronic database from Earth and increasingly understood our world. As a result, the advance technicians communicated with me in broken English.

Part of their purpose was to teach their language and introduce the ‘traveler’, me in this case, to their world and way of life. They also assessed ‘travelers’ for their potential to appreciate the most physically developed men who were celebrated in their civilization. If the ‘traveler’ were gay and attracted to their champions, or could learn to be attracted to them, they would be prepared for a potential coupling. These men would be twice the ‘traveler’s’ size, exceptionally strong, and would not speak any Earth languages. It was a plum job for these ‘hosts’. They were not part of the elite, but they were among their society’s top scientists, and all were on track to elite status. Their job was a rare opportunity to meet and interact with the smaller human ‘travelers’ who were their sexual ideal. For my first few weeks these three scientists, who were tall, massive, and handsome competition-level bodybuilders, would become my teachers and lovers. Their names were Stanj (pronounced “staa-nish”), Ruud (pronounced “rood”), and Dzaan (pronounced “Jaan”).
