I'm looking forward to working together to elevate my music. Let me know if you need anything else.  
  
  
Thank you for bringing this up—no worries, I’m definitely not scared off! I appreciate your transparency, and I’m committed to investing in the success of this project.  
## Budget Range:  
At this stage, I’m thinking of allocating ~$50-$100 for marketing efforts. This range reflects my current resources, and I’m open to discussing how we can make the most of it to achieve our goals.

I understand that marketing is a crucial component, and I’m prepared to invest thoughtfully in areas that will have the most impact, such as targeted online advertising, social media engagement, and content creation.  
## Flexibility:  
I’m also open to adjusting the budget as we progress, depending on what we find works best and what additional resources may become available. I’m keen to ensure that we balance cost-effectiveness with the quality and reach we’re aiming for.  
Let’s discuss how we can prioritize and allocate the budget to maximize our results. I’m looking forward to hearing your thoughts and working together to craft a strategy that fits within this range.
