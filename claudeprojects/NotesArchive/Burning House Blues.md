(Verse 1)  
I built a house so grand, strong and tall,  
But time took its toll, now it’s bound to fall.  
Once it was a home, now it’s a cage,  
Trapped in the past, can’t turn the page.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, my heart is heavy, the flames are high,  
Children lost inside, I hear their cry.  
I’m callin’ out to them, “Come on outside,”  
Before the fire takes ’em in its tide.  
  
(Verse 2)  
Five hundred souls, trapped in their rooms,  
Filthy and dark, facing their dooms.  
Vultures circle, snakes crawl and weave,  
In every corner, horrors conceive.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, my heart is heavy, the flames are high,  
Children lost inside, I hear their cry.  
I’m callin’ out to them, “Come on outside,”  
Before the fire takes ’em in its tide.  
  
[instrumental]  
  
(Bridge)  
Fireflies flicker in the dead of night,  
Dogs and jackals, in the fading light.  
Ghostly shadows, twisted and torn,  
Children playin’, lost and forlorn.  
  
(Verse 3)  
I said, “My dear children, hear my plea,  
I’ve got treasures, come and see.  
Golden carts and jewels so bright,  
Leave the darkness, step into the light.”  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, my heart is heavy, the flames are high,  
Children lost inside, I hear their cry.  
I’m callin’ out to them, “Come on outside,”  
Before the fire takes ’em in its tide.

(Verse 4)  
They came to me, through the smoke and flame,  
Saved from the house, from the burning shame.  
The house of sorrow, now left behind,  
In the light of wisdom, their freedom they find.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, my heart was heavy, but now it’s light,  
Children saved from the fire’s might.  
Together we stand, in the morning dew,  
Singin’ the story of the Burning House Blues.  
  
(Outro)  
So hear my tale, let it touch your soul,  
In the Buddha’s wisdom, we find our goal.  
Leave the burning house, step into the new,  
And sing along with the Burning House Blues.
