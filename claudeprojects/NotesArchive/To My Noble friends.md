# To My Noble friends  
#   
Leave those so called friends who wish to teach us to abandon hope, who teach us to hate, fear, and manipulate others. This is not the Noble path.   
  
It is my prayer that all beings serve a countless number of buddhas and fully carry out an immeasurable number of buddhas’ ways and doctrines. May we exert  ourselves bravely and vigorously, and may our names be universally known. May we realize the Law that is profound and never known before, and preach it in accordance with what is appropriate.

May All Beings know how to make various distinctions and to expound the teachings skillfully. May our words be soft and gentle and delight the hearts of the assembly.  
  
May we fully realize the Law that is limitless, boundless, never attained before.  
  
May we all Respect to the Universal Law of Dharma-Life with our thoughts words and deeds
