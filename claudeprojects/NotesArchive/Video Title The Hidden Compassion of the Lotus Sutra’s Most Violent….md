**Video Title:** The Hidden Compassion of the Lotus Sutra’s Most Violent Verse  
**Description:**  
"Anyone who troubles the expounder of the dharma shall have his head split into seven pieces."  
It sounds like a brutal curse, doesn’t it? In this video, we dive into **Chapter 26 of the Lotus Sutra** to explore one of its most shocking and mysterious verses. Spoken by ten Rakshasi (female demons) and the "Mother-of-Devils," this vow seems incredibly violent for a sacred text, yet they claim their goal is to protect those who practice the Buddha Dharma.  
But what if this threat is actually a **profound teaching on compassion**?  
Join us as we decode the symbolism behind the "split head" and the branches of the "arjaka-tree". We discover that this isn't a literal punishment, but a powerful description of **delusion**—a state of mind where fear builds walls that separate us from the rest of the world.  
**In this video, you will explore:**  
* Why "demonic" figures vow to protect Dharma practitioners and what this reveals about the nature of those who create harm.  
* How the "split head" is a metaphor for a mind at war with itself, torn apart by self-made fear and internal separation.  
* How Buddhist teachings serve as a roadmap to develop the **courage to live in harmony**, breaking down the barriers we build against the world.  
* The realization that this "curse" is actually a warning against the self-harm of living in a divided reality.  
Watch now to understand how we can heal the painful split inside our own minds and find wholeness.

**Video Title Idea:**  
Lotus Sutra University: The Curriculum for Universal Enlightenment  
**Video Description:**  
Welcome to **Lotus Sutra University**, a conceptual framework that reimagines one of Mahayana Buddhism’s most profound texts as a comprehensive academy for human transformation.  
In this video, we break down the 28 chapters of the *Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra* (Lotus Sutra) into academic "colleges" and "departments." We explore how the Buddha’s teachings are not just ancient doctrines, but a rigorous curriculum designed to awaken the potential for Buddhahood in every living being.  
**In this video, we cover:**  
🎓 **The University Core:** The "Office of the President" is governed by the **Ekayāna (One Vehicle)** doctrine. We discuss how all diverse Buddhist paths are ultimately "Skillful Means" (*Upāya*) leading to the same goal: universal enlightenment.  
📚 **The College of Foundational Studies (Theoretical Gate):** We look at the famous **Parables**—like the *Burning House*, the *Prodigal Son*, and the *Hidden Jewel*—as courses in "Narrative Theology." These stories teach us that the "treasure" of Buddha-nature is already sewn into the lining of our garments, waiting to be discovered,.  
⚡ **The School of Radical Inclusion:** We explore the "destiny studies" of the Sutra, featuring the **Dragon King’s Daughter** and **Devadatta**. These narratives challenge traditional hierarchies of gender and morality, proving that enlightenment is accessible to all—instantaneously and without discrimination,.  
🌌 **The Department of Deep Time (Essential Gate):** We step into the "Ceremony in the Air" and the emergence of the massive **Treasure Tower**. We discuss the doctrine of the **Eternal Buddha** (Chapter 16), which shifts our focus from a historical timeline to "Deep Time," revealing that the Buddha is constantly teaching in this world,.  
🛡️ **The Institute for Applied Practice:** Finally, we look at the "Bodhisattvas of the Earth" and the protective arts. We examine how practices like the **Samantabhadra Vows** and **Dhāraṇī** (protective mantras) serve as the "alumni network," ensuring the teachings are preserved and propagated through compassionate action in the real world,.  
**The Graduate Thesis:** Every student at this university defends the same thesis: "All beings, without exception, possess Buddha-nature and are destined for supreme enlightenment".  
**Key Concepts Explained:**  
* **Ekayāna (One Vehicle):** The unification of all paths.  
* **Upāya (Skillful Means):** Tailoring the method to the student.  
* **The Eternal Buddha:** The immeasurable lifespan of the Tathāgata.  
* **Bodhisattvas of the Earth:** Emergent leadership from within ordinary life.
