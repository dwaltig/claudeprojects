# A Quiet Flame of Kindness  
  
A quiet flame of kindness in their heart,  
A steady glow of wisdom guiding each step.  
They hold every soul in gentle reverence—  
No measure of fame, no difference of creed  
Can dim their empathy or turn them away.  
  
Where fear trembles, they stand firm,  
A pillar of courage against raging winds.  
They speak softly, yet each word brings warmth,  
Like sunlight piercing the gray of doubt  
And urging the seeds of hope to rise.  
  
In their eyes flickers a humble grace—  
Not chasing glory, but lifting others  
From the valley of sorrow or uncertainty.  
They look upon life as a grand tapestry,  
Each thread precious and bound by care.  
  
A living song of compassion they are,  
Cradling the weary in steadfast arms;  
A mirror of limitless possibility,  
Reflecting our own forgotten heights.  
They walk among us, a gentle reminder  
That all carry brilliance beneath the skin.
