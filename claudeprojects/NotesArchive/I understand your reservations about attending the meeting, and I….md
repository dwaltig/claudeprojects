I understand your reservations about attending the meeting, and I want to assure you that your participation, whether in person or by proxy, is highly valuable. Signing a proxy card allows you to have a say in the meeting's outcomes and ensures your voice is heard, even if you choose not to attend physically.  
Please know that using a proxy is a legitimate means of participation used by members around the world and is fully supported by our by-laws. It is your right as a member to use a proxy, and doing so contributes to the diversity of opinions and decision-making that makes our board effective. It doesn't lessen the significance of your role; on the contrary, it reinforces it.

Also, the use of proxies doesn't inflate attendance figures dishonestly; it simply ensures that all members' perspectives are considered, regardless of their ability to attend. This reflects a full and fair representation of the member’s views, not a manipulation of numbers. I encourage you to exercise your right to vote via proxy and stay involved in our collective efforts to govern effectively.
