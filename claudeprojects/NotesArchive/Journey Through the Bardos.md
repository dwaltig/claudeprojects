When the breath fades away   
When the breath fades away   
and the light starts to dim,  
A tunnel appears,   
A tunnel appears,   
where the journey begins.  
In the Bardo of Death,   
In the Bardo of Death,   
shadows whisper our name,  
Hold on to the light,   
Hold on to the light,   
resist the dark flame.

Oh, through the Bardos,   
Oh, through the Bardos,   
we wander and roam,  
From death to rebirth,   
From death to rebirth,   
we’re searching for home.  
In the dark and the light,   
In the dark and the light,   
In the dark and the light,   
we find our way,  
Through sorrow and hope,   
Through sorrow and hope,   
we face a new day.  
we face a new day.

Visions of gods,   
Visions of gods,   
Visions of gods,   
Visions of gods,   
Visions of gods,   
peaceful and fierce,  
They come to confront   
They come to confront   
all our deepest fears.  
Clear light shines bright,   
Clear light shines bright,   
but it fades from your view,  
but it fades from your view,  
but it fades from your view,  
Lost in illusions,   
Lost in illusions,   
You seek what is true.  
You seek what is true.

Hear the voices calling,   
Hear the voices calling,   
from the other side,  
Guiding us with wisdom,    
Guiding us with wisdom,    
Guiding us with wisdom,    
as we let go of pride.  
Trust in the process,   
Trust in the process,   
surrender to grace,  
In the cycle of life,   
In the cycle of life,   
we all find our place.

In the Bardo of Becoming,   
In the Bardo of Becoming,   
we choose our new birth,  
Karma decides our place   
Karma decides our place   
on this earth.  
A spark of a life,   
A spark of a life,   
in the womb,it begins,  
From sorrow to hope,   
From sorrow to hope,   
the cycle spins.

And in each new breath,   
And in each new breath,   
the spirit breaks through.
