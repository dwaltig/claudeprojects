Call for Board Officer Applications    
  
The Briarpoint Board of Directors is seeking a *fifth member* to join us as an *officer*!    
  
We currently have four board members, and to ensure smooth decision-making, we aim to add a new voice to our team. The role will be ideal for someone interested in contributing to the community and learning about board operations.    
  
Here’s what you need to know:    
- The new officer will serve *without a specific role initially*, providing an opportunity to observe, learn, and grow into the position.    
- As per protocol, the board president typically abstains from voting unless needed to break a tie. Adding a fifth member will prevent tie votes and promote efficient governance.    
- This is a great chance to collaborate with dedicated leaders and make a meaningful impact on our community.    
  
If you are interested in serving on the board or would like to nominate someone, please contact our property manager, Megan Bostick, at [mbostick@cmctx.com](mailto:mbostick@cmctx.com).   
  
We welcome your involvement and look forward to hearing from you!    
  
Sincerely,    
William Altig  
President
