Lyrics:   
[Verse 1] Yo, joyful heart, take flight, no chains, no ties, We rise fearless, high up in the skies. Left the past, watch the new path shine, Truth’s in the light, now our souls align.  
[Verse 2] No shadows, no doubts, yeah, we breakin' the mold, Left expedient ways, now our hearts pure gold. Deep wisdom's in us, spirits stay bold, Enlightenment’s here, untold stories unfold.  
[Chorus] To all the seekers, we’ll lead the way, Through the night, bringin' light to the day. Unsurpassed, watch us blaze that flame, Come together, it’s time to claim.  
[Verse 3] Boundaries gone, bridges rise, we solid now, Unsurpassed, new worlds, we take the vow. Hearts in sync, chasin' peace under the sun, Voices loud, every step, we become one.  
[Bridge] Echoes ringin', harmony's in flight, Secrets unfold as we bring the light. Fearless steps, we got vision in sight, Teach the world love, hearts burnin' bright.  
[Chorus] To all the seekers, we’ll lead the way, Through the night, bringin' light to the day. Unsurpassed, watch us blaze that flame, Come together, it’s time to claim.
