Yes, Western Union offers several delivery methods for sending and receiving money, including cash pickup at agent locations, direct deposit into bank accounts, and transfers to mobile wallets...  
  
When sending, you will choose either ( The Delivery Method )  
● Cash pick up at Agent location   
( You will use my name and only my address for this delivery method, no bank details. )  
  
Or   
  
● Transfer to Mobile Wallet number. ( I use my mom information for that )

These two delivery methods are instant reflection compared to the direct deposit to Bank Account... which makes it hard for me here because of our low banking system ..
