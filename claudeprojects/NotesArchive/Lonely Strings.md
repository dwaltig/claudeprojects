[Verse]  
Lonely road so long  
Singin' all night strong  
Love done me so wrong  
Heartache in my song  
  
[Verse 2]  
Midnight shadows fall  
Hear the lonesome call  
Lovin' you my all  
Now I hit the wall  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby come back to me  
Set my spirit free  
Ain't no remedy  
Without you can't be  
  
[Verse 3]  
Memories they keen  
In the light serene  
Pain it cuts so mean  
In my bluesy scene  
  
[Bridge]  
Guitar cries the pain  
Through the pouring rain  
All my days in vain  
Till you're back again  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby come back to me  
Set my spirit free  
Ain't no remedy  
Without you can't be
