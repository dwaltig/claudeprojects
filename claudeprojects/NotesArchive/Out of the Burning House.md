# Out of the Burning House  
  
Style: Slow blues-folk shuffle *(think a cross between early Dylan and a Lightnin’ Hopkins ballad)*  
**6/8** (gives you that rolling, story-telling sway)  
≈ 84 bpm *(six eighth-notes per bar; feels like a relaxed 1—2—3 / 4—5—6)*  
**G major** (easy on guitar / capo-friendly; the blues notes come from the minor 3rd & flat-7)  
Low **D4** up to **B4** (comfortable baritone; you can capo or transpose)  
  
✨** What you’re hearing**  
  
“**Ox Cart to Freedom**” (a.k.a. *Smoke to Serenity Blues*) turns a 2,000-year-old Buddhist parable into a slow-rolling, 6/8 blues ballad. Barrel-house piano, slide guitar, and a gospel-tinged choir ride beneath William Altig’s gravel-warm lead, while Suno AI fills the room with cinematic depth.  
  
🔥** The story in the lyrics**  
	•	A **rotting mansion** in flames = the suffering world of samsara.  
	•	**Playful children** = our distracted minds, chasing small pleasures.  
	•	A compassionate **Father** = the Buddha, using “skillful means” to guide us.  
	•	Three shiny **goat & deer carts** = promises that spark hope.  
	•	The radiant **white ox cart** = ultimate liberation, the Buddha-vehicle.  
  
Each verse walks you from smoke-choked halls to the open dawn, where “craving, aversion, ignorance” finally loosen their grip.  
  
🌿** Why it matters**  
  
This song is a hymn for anyone who’s felt the heat of modern life and longed for a clear exit. It reminds us that our deepest yearnings can be “bent toward the open way” when wisdom meets compassion.

**(Verse 1)**  
I once knew a mansion, mighty old and grand,  
Timbers warped and rotten, set on shifting sand.  
Inside those crumbling halls the children laughed away,  
Never smelled the smoke, never felt the heat—just play.  
  
**(Chorus)**  
Oh, this burning house, my friend, is the world we roam;  
Samsara’s heavy grip holds us far from home.  
And that fire ain’t embers—craving rages deep inside,  
Greed, aversion, ignorance—nowhere left to hide.  
We’re children lost within illusion’s bright display,  
Yet a loving Father shines and lights the way.  
  
**(Verse 2)**  
Flames were climbing sky-high, dancing on the roof,  
Birth and bitter aging, sorrow as the proof.  
Greed and hatred crackled, ignorance fanned the glow,  
Beasts of craving gnawing at the soul below.  
Demons in the rafters, shadows thick with doom—  
Echoes of our suffering haunted every room.  
  
**(Chorus)**  
Oh, this burning house, my friend, is the world we roam;  
Samsara’s heavy grip holds us far from home.  
And that fire ain’t embers—craving rages deep inside,  
Greed, aversion, ignorance—nowhere left to hide.  
We’re children lost within illusion’s bright display,  
Yet a loving Father shines and lights the way.  
  
**(Verse 3)**  
The Father watched in sorrow, tears upon His face;  
Knew a shouted warning wouldn’t leave a trace.  
Toys and make-believe still owned the children’s dreams,  
So He spun a gentle ruse—clever as it seems.  
Couldn’t pull them outward through that narrow door;  
Had to lure them softly, promise something more.  
  
**(Chorus)**  
Oh, this burning house, my friend, is the world we roam;  
Samsara’s heavy grip holds us far from home.  
And that fire ain’t embers—craving rages deep inside,  
Greed, aversion, ignorance—nowhere left to hide.  
We’re children lost within illusion’s bright display,  
Yet a loving Father shines and lights the way.  
  
**(Verse 4)**  
He whispered through the smoke of goat carts trimmed in gold,  
Deer carts swift and nimble, marvels yet untold.  
Then the milk-white ox cart, gleaming like the dawn—  
Greater than their wishes, waiting on the lawn.  
He read their playful longings—laughter, games, and play,  
And turned those very longings toward the open way.  
  
**(Bridge)**  
He never used force, nor thundered threats of dread;  
He kindled a longing in each child’s head.  
These skillful means, my friend, aren’t a simple lie—  
They open hidden pathways under clearer sky.  
Father’s brimming wisdom sees what we can be,  
Past the fleeting pleasures into liberty.  
  
**(Chorus)**  
Oh, this burning house, my friend, is the world we roam;  
Samsara’s heavy grip holds us far from home.  
And that fire ain’t embers—craving rages deep inside,  
Greed, aversion, ignorance—nowhere left to hide.  
We’re children lost within illusion’s bright display,  
Yet a loving Father shines and lights the way.  
  
**(Outro)**  
So step out of the ashes, leave the night behind;  
Ride the shining ox cart, gift for humankind.  
Father’s boundless mercy calls to you and me—  
Walk the road together, finally free.
