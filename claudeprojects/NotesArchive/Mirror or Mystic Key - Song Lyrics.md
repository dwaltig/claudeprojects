Verse 1:   
Walkin' and wonderin', just another day  
Wisdom comes whisp'ring, sweeps me away  
World shifts and shimmers, nothing's the same  
Woken to wonders, I can't explain  
  
Chorus:   
Are thoughts just sparks in a cosmic sea?  
Or signs and signals of what's to be?  
Is my mind a mirror or a mystic key?  
To unlock the truths I long to see?  
  
Verse 2:   
Science speaks of synapses and cells,  
But silence and stillness have tales to tell  
Of visions and voices and verdant dreams,  
And realities split at the seams  
  
Chorus:   
Are thoughts just sparks in a cosmic sea?  
Or signs and signals of what's to be?  
Is my mind a mirror or a mystic key?  
To unlock the truths I long to see?  
  
Verse 3:   
Mushrooms, mantras, magnetic waves,  
Fasting, focusing, sensory caves  
From streets to mountaintops, labs to shrines,  
We're all just seeking the divine  
We're all just seeking the divine  
  
Bridge:   
The more we know, the less we understand  
The less we grasp, the more we comprehend  
In clarity, confusion often lies  
In doubt and darkness, wisdom sometimes flies  
  
Chorus:  
Are thoughts just sparks in a cosmic sea?  
Or signs and signals of what's to be?  
Is my mind a mirror or a mystic key?  
To unlock the truths I long to see?
