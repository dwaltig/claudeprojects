# Roots  
ChatGPT  
  
Verse 1:  
In a valley so green,   
under sunlight's warm grace,  
Two trees grew tall,   
each held their own space.  
The oak, steadfast,   
with roots running deep,  
The willow, soft,   
would bend as it weeps.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, the oak and the willow,   
two paths we all know,  
In life’s wild winds,   
how far will we grow?  
With roots to the ground,   
and eyes on the sky,  
Some will endure,   
while some will fly.  
  
Verse 2: A tempest rolled in,   
clouds heavy and stark,  
The wind lashed the valley,   
tearing the dark.  
The oak braced firm,   
branches bending with might,  
But the willow was taken,   
lost to the night.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, the oak and the willow,   
two paths we all know,  
In life’s wild winds,   
how far will we grow?  
With roots to the ground,   
and eyes on the sky,  
Some will endure,   
while some will fly.  
  
Bridge:   
The oak still stands,   
though battered and worn,  
Its strength a truth   
from the storm reborn.  
The willow now whispers,   
a ghost in the breeze,  
Reminding us all   
to anchor in peace.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, the oak and the willow,   
two paths we all know,  
In life’s wild winds,   
how far will we grow?  
With roots to the ground,   
and eyes on the sky,  
Some will endure,   
while some will fly.  
  
Outro:  
So plant your roots deep,   
in earth rich and true,  
Let wisdom and faith   
guide all that you do.  
When change sweeps in,   
you’ll rise with the storm,  
Reaching the heavens,   
in peace, you'll transform.
