# Embrace the Change  
# Embrace the Change  
# Embrace the Change  
# Embrace the Change  
# Embrace the Change  
# Embrace the Change  
  
## [Verse 1]  
## In the shadows,   
## we found our place,  
## Lost in echoes,   
## of a faceless race.  
## But now we rise,   
## break the chains,  
## From the darkness,   
## we embrace the change.  
## we embrace the change.  
  
## [Pre-Chorus]  
## Heartbeat syncs   
## with the city's flow,  
## In this electric light,   
## we start to grow.  
## Voices lifted,   
## we defy the past,  
## In this moment,   
## we make it last.  
##   
## [Chorus]  
## Break free,   
## no more hiding away,  
## Reason guides us,   
## lighting the way.  
## Knowledge flows,   
## like a river wide,  
## Fueling dreams,   
## we will embrace the change.  
## we will embrace the change.  
## we will embrace the change.  
## we will embrace the change.  
## we will embrace the change.  
## we will embrace the change.  
## we will embrace the change.  
## we will embrace the change.  
## we will embrace the change.  
## we will embrace the change.  
## we will embrace the change.  
##   
## [Verse 2]  
## In the chaos,   
## we found our calm,  
## Echoes of wisdom,   
## like a healing psalm.  
## With every step,   
## we shed the weight,  
## In this new dawn,   
## we create our fate.  
##   
## [Instrumental]  
##   
## [Bridge]  
## Drop the beat,   
## feel the rhythm rise,  
## In this unity,   
## we find our skies.  
## Electronic pulses,   
## heartbeats align,  
## In this fusion,   
## we redefine.  
##   
## [Chorus]  
## Break free,   
## no more hiding away,  
## Reason guides us,   
## lighting the way.  
## Knowledge flows,   
## like a river wide,  
## Fueling dreams,   
## we won't be denied.  
##

## Hip-hop verses,   
## spoken truth,  
## In these lyrics,   
## we find the proof.  
## Voices merging,  
##  breaking the mold,  
## In this fusion,   
## we find our soul.  
##   
## [Outro]  
## Soar on wings,   
## reach for the sky,  
## With hearts on fire,   
## we won't say goodbye.  
## In the light,   
## we find what we seek,  
## In this unity,   
## we find our peak.  
##   
## [End]
