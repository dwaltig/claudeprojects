# The Wisdom Eye Blues  
  
**(Genre: Grounded Blues/Folk)**  
**(Structure: AAB Rhyme Scheme, typical of the blues, emphasizing repetition and deep, common-sense wisdom drawn from the sources)**  
  
**(Verse 1)**   
I woke up one morning, heart heavy and tired,   
Living in a world of conflict, with my desires fired.   
My physical eyes, they saw pleasure, they saw pain,   
Caught in the dualistic storm, standing out in the rain.   
But the Master stood preachin’ on **Vulture Peak** way up high,   
Said, "That world of suffering ain't the truth that you deny."   
He said, "It’s this very *Saha* world, if you could only switch your view,   
The **eternal Pure Land** waiting right here for me and you."  
  
**(Chorus)**   
Oh, the Dharma is the medicine for the soul that's been bruised,   
It's the cure for the mind that’s habitually confused.   
You gotta open up that **wisdom eye, the spiritual sight**,   
See the **equality and differences of all things** right.   
Drop the fight, drop the fear, and you shall surely find,   
The **joys and wonders** woven in the fabric of your troubled mind.  
  
**(Verse 2)**   
They call it **emptiness**, not nothingness, but lacking fixed form,   
Everything dependently arisen, weathering the storm.   
That shared nature, that's the equal ground,   
But the different shapes we see are the way things spin around.   
No need to run away, no need to try and escape,   
'Cause *samsara* and *nirvana* ain't separated on this map.   
It’s a realization of **non-duality** that breaks the concrete hold,   
A story of transformation that’s far more precious than gold.  
  
**(Chorus)**   
Oh, the Dharma is the medicine for the soul that's been bruised,   
It's the cure for the mind that’s habitually confused.   
You gotta open up that **wisdom eye, the spiritual sight**,   
See the **equality and differences of all things** right.   
Drop the fight, drop the fear, and you shall surely find,   
The **joys and wonders** woven in the fabric of your troubled mind.  
  
**(Bridge)**   
Now, you can't just listen, you gotta **keep this *sūtra* deep**,   
'Cause that act of keeping is the faith you gotta steep.   
You are manifesting the Buddha’s body, right here where you stand.   
And **make an offering**, don’t hold it back in your hand.   
Not just jeweled garments, but your time and your devotion, too,   
**Give what you’re attached to**; let that self-illusion break through.   
And honor the **keepers of the Dharma**—the living link we see,   
Honor them like the World Lord, for they manifest reality.  
  
**(Outro)**   
Yeah, honor the keeper, that’s the highest act of grace.   
You ain’t just changing the world, you’re changing your place.   
Get that knowledge quickly, break that dualistic chain.   
Find the wonder in the conflict, and wipe away the pain.   
The wisdom eye is open, yeah, the wisdom eye is open now.   
It's time to **see things for what they are**, and take a bow.
