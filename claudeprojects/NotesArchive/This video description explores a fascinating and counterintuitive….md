**Why the Buddha Intentionally Made Himself RARE: The Psychology of Presence (Lotus Sūtra Explained)**  
Have you ever noticed how scarcity automatically makes us appreciate things more, like a limited edition sneaker or a once-in-a-lifetime concert? What if this wasn't just a modern marketing trick, but a deep teaching strategy used thousands of years ago?  
In this video, we dive into a core puzzle: If the Buddha had world-changing wisdom that could literally end suffering, why would he seem to be holding it back and intentionally make himself hard to find?  
The answer is found in the *Lotus Sūtra*, where the Buddha straight up tells his followers: "**Bhikṣus, know this! It is difficult to see a Buddha who appears in [this] world**". This statement immediately raises a natural suspicion: Was the Buddha being stingy with his **precious wisdom**?  
The ancient texts tackle this question head-on, explaining that the answer has **absolutely nothing to do with being stingy**. Instead, it is a masterclass in psychology and a **diagnosis of human nature**.  
The Buddha reveals that if his followers believe that he is **always here** (constant presence) and do not think that he will pass away, they will become **too arrogant and lazy**. When we take wisdom for granted, we lose its value and **will not respect me**.  
Therefore, the Buddha used a deliberate and skillful strategy, teaching "**expediently**". This method involves creating a sense of **perceived scarcity**. This feeling of rarity inspires genuine **respect** and compels people to pay closer attention. This strategy ensures that his wisdom **wouldn't be wasted** on an audience that wasn't yet ready to truly hear it.  
This ancient explainer isn't just a history lesson; it's a mirror. This psychological principle is at play all around us every day—we often take our loved ones, our time, and our opportunities for granted until we are faced with their absence.  
Tune in to discover how the Buddha’s skillful use of **expediency** was designed to **wake us up** and remind us that everything we value is, in a very real way, a rare and **precious thing**.
