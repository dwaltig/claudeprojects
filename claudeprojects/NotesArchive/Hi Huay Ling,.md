Hi Huay Ling,

Hi Huay Ling,  
  
Thanks for reaching out. I hope you're doing well!  
  
Just to quickly clarify a few things - the emails for Ethan's lessons are sent out automatically by CARTUS Torch/Platform, not by me personally. What I do is include the same Google Meet link in each appointment so we're all on the same page.  
  
I've noticed there's been a bit of a mix-up with an old link that's been going around. I've been trying to get this sorted out by suggesting we all save the new link and stop using the old one.   
  
Thanks so much for helping to keep things running smoothly, and if there's anything else you need or if something's not clear, just give me a shout!  
  
Take care,  
  
Mr. William Altig
