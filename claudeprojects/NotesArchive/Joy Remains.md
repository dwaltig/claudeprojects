[Verse]  
We search the world, for something more,  
A treasure hidden, a distant shore,  
But joy is here, it’s in our name,  
When we let go, it still remains.  
  
[Chorus]  
Joy’s not a gift, we must acquire,  
It’s the glow beneath the fire,  
When the clouds of mind are gone,  
Joy is the light that leads us on.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Delusion speaks, with a siren’s call,  
Attachment builds, these heavy walls,  
But clear the dust, the truth is plain,  
What’s left behind, is joy’s refrain.  
  
[Chorus]  
Joy’s not a gift, we must acquire,  
It’s the glow beneath the fire,  
When the clouds of mind are gone,  
Joy is the light that leads us on.  
  
[Bridge]  
In whispered winds, and morning dew,  
There’s a spark, in all you do,  
Close your eyes, and you will find,  
Joy’s been here, all the time.  
  
[Chorus]  
Joy’s not a gift we must acquire,  
It’s the glow beneath the fire,  
When the clouds of mind are gone,  
Joy is the light that leads us on.
