# "Boundless Compassion (The Necklace of Gems)"  
# *(A Bluesy Folk Song)*  
#   
"Boundless Compassion (The Necklace of Gems)" is a soulful, blues-infused folk ballad that weaves a timeless Buddhist parable into a universal anthem of generosity and interconnectedness. Inspired by Chapter 25 of the Lotus Sutra, the song tells the story of Endless-Intent Bodhisattva’s offering of a priceless necklace to World-Voice-Perceiver (Avalokiteshvara), who initially refuses the gift until the Buddha intervenes, urging them to accept it out of compassion for all beings. With haunting imagery of celestial dragons, divine musicians, and humble souls, the lyrics explore themes of selflessness, shared merit, and the transformative power of kindness. The melody’s melancholic yet hopeful tone mirrors the tension between earthly suffering and spiritual liberation, while the chorus—a rallying cry to "let your heart be a bridge"—invites listeners to embody compassion as a force that binds all life.

Lyrics:   
[Verse 1]  
Endless-Intent came with a gift in his hand,  
A necklace of gems, more than wealth could demand.  
He said, "World-Voice-Pearce, take this treasure from me,  
For your compassion’s a light on this dark, endless sea."  
  
But the Bodhisattva shook their head, "I cannot receive,  
For my path is to give, not to take or believe.  
These jewels are too heavy, their shine too bright,  
I walk in the shadows, to bring others to light."  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, the Buddha said, "Take it, don’t let it fall,  
For compassion’s a river that flows for us all.  
Share it with the heavens, the earth, and the sky,  
Let your heart be a bridge, let your spirit fly high."  
  
[Verse 2]  
So World-Voice-Pearce took the necklace in hand,  
And divided the gems as the Buddha had planned.  
One half for Shakyamuni, one for the Stupa’s glow,  
A gift for the ages, to help all beings grow.  
  
From gods in the heavens to dragons below,  
From the hungry and weary to the ones we don’t know,  
The merit flowed outward, a boundless tide,  
A circle of giving where no one’s denied.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, the Buddha said, "Take it, don’t let it fall,  
For compassion’s a river that flows for us all.  
Share it with the heavens, the earth, and the sky,  
Let your heart be a bridge, let your spirit fly high."  
  
[Bridge]  
The yakshas and garudas, the kinnaras sing,  
The gandharvas play as the bells softly ring.  
From the highest deva to the humblest soul,  
The merit of kindness makes the broken world whole.  
  
[Verse 3]  
So if you’ve got a gift, don’t hold it too tight,  
Let it flow like a river, let it shine like a light.  
For the jewels of this world are just fleeting and vain,  
But the merit of compassion is an eternal flame.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, the Buddha said, "Take it, don’t let it fall,  
For compassion’s a river that flows for us all.  
Share it with the heavens, the earth, and the sky,  
Let your heart be a bridge, let your spirit fly high."  
  
[Outro]  
Boundless compassion, it starts with a spark,  
A gift from the heart in the infinite dark.  
So give what you can, let your kindness be known,  
And the merit you share will never be alone.
