**[Verse 1]**  
**[Verse 1]**  
No, no, I will not say any more,  
My teaching is wonderful, yet hard to explore.  
If the arrogant hear me, they turn away,  
Rejecting the truth, not knowing the way.  
  
**[Chorus]**

**[Chorus]**  
We must be prepared for wisdom’s light,  
Discern what’s false and what is right.  
Let go of truths that fade with time,  
And seek the path where wisdom shines.

**[Verse 2]**  
All things are impermanent, ever-changing like the tide,  
The truths we once held dearly now must be set aside.  
In ignorance, we suffer, in confusion we dwell,  
Only by gaining insight can we break free from this spell.  
  
**Chorus**  
**Chorus**  
We must be prepared for wisdom’s light,  
Discern what’s false and what is right.  
Let go of truths that fade with time,  
And seek the path where wisdom shines.  
And seek the path where wisdom shines.

The Buddha knew the time would come  
When hearts are open, and minds are one.  
To receive the teaching, pure and true,  
We must be ready to start anew.

Śāriputra asked, “Reveal to me,  
The highest truth, the sacred key.”  
But the Buddha knew, we must first grow,  
To understand what we don’t yet know.  
  
**[Chorus**]

**[Chorus**]  
We must be prepared for wisdom’s light,  
Discern what’s false and what is right.  
Let go of truths that fade with time,  
And seek the path where wisdom shines.

Set aside the old, embrace the new,  
Let wisdom guide in all we do.  
From ignorance, we rise and learn,  
To the Buddha’s truth, we now return.  
To the Buddha’s truth, we now return.
