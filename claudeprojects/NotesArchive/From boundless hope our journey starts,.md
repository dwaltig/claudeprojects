From boundless hope our journey starts,  
With courage fierce and open hearts.  
Power to uplift, influence to heal,  
Respect and generosity, truths made real.  
  
Through storms we rise with steady grace,  
Resilient souls in wisdom’s embrace.  
Oh, the joy that wisdom brings—  
A radiant light on eagle’s wings
