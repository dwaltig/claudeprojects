# The Unfolding Silence  
  
A **luminous mind**, from **purest light** unfurled,   
Reflects the truth across **a billion worlds. **  
No fleeting form, no earthly dust it knows,   
But **pure and indestructible**, eternally it glows.  
  
This **Dharmakaya**, vast as **cosmic space**,   
An **adamantine body**, held in time's embrace.   
Through **kalpas** deep, where silent stars convene,   
The **Buddha's presence**, boundless and serene.  
  
It breathes in mountains, whispers in the rain,   
An **omnipresent truth**, easing every pain.   
Not just a distant past, a story told, But life's   
**inherent essence9**, brave and bold.  
  
For in each heart, a **Buddha-nature** lies,   
A **sacred womb** where wisdom softly rise.   
No outer quest, no distant goal to chase,   
But **uncovering** the wonder, beauty, grace.  
  
The **universe itself**, the Buddha's face unseen,   
A vibrant tapestry, eternally pristine.   
And **every being's life**, in **Ten Worlds** profound,   
With this **eternal Buddha**, deeply bound.  
  
So in the quiet, let your spirit bloom,   
Dispelling **delusion's** shadows, conquering the gloom.   
For peace within, transforms the world outside,   
The **Buddha's vow** in every turning tide.
