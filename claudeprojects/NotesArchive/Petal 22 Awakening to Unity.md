Petal 22: Awakening to Unity  
	The Lotus Sutra reveals the profound interconnectedness of all life. It reminds us that our destinies are intertwined, and our actions ripple through the web of existence. With this awareness, we step into a world of greater responsibility and compassion, understanding that our choices influence the well-being of all beings.  
   
	Echoing this sentiment, environmental activist Greta Thunberg emphasizes, "Our actions have consequences, and they all contribute to the bigger picture." The interconnectedness of humanity and the environment is a stark reminder of the impact of our choices. The Lotus Sutra calls us to foster a sense of global responsibility, recognizing that the planet's well-being is intrinsically linked to the well-being of all its inhabitants.
