Also known as the Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings. A sutra regarded as the introductory teaching, or prologue, to the Lotus Sutra. It was translated into Chinese in 481 by Dharmagathayashas, a monk from central India. The sutra describes the Buddha’s preaching on Eagle Peak and consists of three chapters. In the first chapter, “Virtuous Practices,” the Bodhisattva Great Adornment praises Shakyamuni Buddha in verse on behalf of the assembly. This verse section contains the passage known as the thirty-four negations, which refers to the substance or essence of the Buddha. The Immeasurable Meaning Sutra is a revered Mahayana Buddhist scripture that elucidates various aspects of the Buddha's teachings, such as the nature of reality, the path to enlightenment, and the qualities of the enlightened ones. Chapter One, titled "Virtue," is particularly significant as it sets the stage for the sutra, introducing the assembly of living beings and the praise of Shakyamuni Buddha by the bodhisattvas. This essay will examine the two sections of Chapter One, analyzing the diverse audience of the assembly and the praise of Shakyamuni Buddha led by the Bodhisattva-Mahasattva Great Dignified Adornment.
