# The Day the Buddha Called My Name  
  
"The Day the Buddha Called My Name" is a powerful acoustic blues-folk track that tells a story of profound spiritual transformation. It speaks to anyone who has felt limited by their own expectations or been searching for their true, unbounded potential.  
  
The song’s narrative is drawn directly from Chapter Nine of the ancient *Lotus Sūtra*. It begins with the weariness of a disciple who thought they had reached the end of their path in a "low goal" of limited peace (Arhatship). The music then swells dramatically to describe the moment the Buddha confers a **Prophecy** (*Vyākaraṇa*), revealing that all beings are destined for the highest, complete state of Buddhahood.    
  
This assurance sparks an explosive, overwhelming **joy**, likened to being **"sprinkled with sweet dew"** (*Amṛta*) —a symbol of eternal life and spiritual rebirth. The song is a declaration of universal potential, asserting that the single, ultimate path (*Ekayāna*) is open to everyone, regardless of where they are on their journey.    
  
It is an anthem about moving from resignation to courageous, dynamic engagement with life, confirming that the greatest realization is inherent within us all.

(Music starts with a slow, steady acoustic guitar riff and a sustained harmonica note, establishing a grounded blues tempo.)  
  
**(Verse 1—**Guitar and bass rhythm only. Harmonica enters mournfully. Vocal is conversational, weary storytelling. Theme: The limited "rest" of Arhatship.**)**  I walked the road for forty years or more,   
Thought I’d seen every truth behind the door.  I took my peace, thought my fighting days were done,  Thought I’d reached the *Arhat’s* rest, beneath the setting sun.  But that Nirvāṇa felt cold, thin, and deep,  A quiet kind of promise that I couldn't keep.    
  
**(Chorus—**Dynamic shift. Energy and harmony lift (to relative major). Drums enter. Vocal delivers powerful, Gospel-style conviction and **Joy**. Lyric emphasis on "Prophecy" and "Sweet Dew."**)**  Then the Buddha called my name, Lord, He called out loud and clear,   
Wiped away my blindness and He banished all my fear.   
He gave a **Prophecy** to me, a future guarantee   
That the final path is open, open even unto me.   
Feel that sweet, sweet **Dew** fall, washes all the sorrow clean   
The boundless potential, wider than I’d ever seen.    
  
**(Verse 2—**Return to conversational style.**)**   
He said the paths you walked, they were a **Skillful Means**   
Just different kinds of pictures to describe the ancient scenes.   
He said the Three Great Ways, they point to only **One** wide path   
To turn away from seeking truth invites the Dharma’s wrath.   
We thought we were done, ready for the final sleep,   
But the fire of the Buddha runs so strong and runs so deep.    
  
**(Chorus—**Full, powerful repeat. Emphasize universal potential.**)**   
Then the Buddha called my name, Lord, He called out loud and clear,   
Wiped away my blindness and He banished all my fear.   
He gave a **Prophecy** to me, a future guarantee   
That the final path is open, open even unto me.   
Feel that sweet, sweet **Dew** fall, washes all the sorrow clean   
The boundless potential, wider than I’d ever seen.    
  
**(Bridge)**   
It ain’t a static state of calm, ain’t just a simple prayer,   
It's the dynamic unfolding, wisdom in the air.   
Gotta take this new assurance, gotta live it right now,   
Gotta work for every being, gotta keep my Bodhisattva vow.   
This **Completeness** ain't for me alone, it’s for the wide, wide world   
Every single banner must be finally unfurled.    
  
**(Outro—**Guitar and Harmonica sustain a fading chord, ending on a note of deep, settled peace.**)**   
Yeah, the final path is open... for you, and for me.   
The boundless One Vehicle... for all humanity.   
O, that sweet dew... (Harmonica fades slowly)   
Washes me clean.
