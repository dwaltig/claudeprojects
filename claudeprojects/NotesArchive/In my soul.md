[verse 1]  
In my soul,   
a longing burned,  
A dream, a passion,   
my heart yearned.  
To weave words,   
to paint with my pen,  
A poet's journey,   
no end.  
  
[chorus]  
Reflecting on this path I've trod,  
Filled with gratitude, blessed by God.  
Dreams fuel our desires, Ignite our souls, set us on fire.  
  
[verse 2]  
Through doubt and fear,   
I found my way,  
With each verse,   
my soul would say.  
Seeking connection,   
making whole,  
Pouring out   
from deep within my soul.  
  
[chorus]  
Reflecting on this path I've trod,  
Filled with gratitude,   
blessed by God.  
Dreams fuel our desires,  
Ignite our souls,   
set us on fire.

[reprise-verse 2]  
Through doubt and fear,

Pouring out   
from deep within my soul.

[instrumental]  
  
[Bridge]  
Wandering,   
seeking a new muse,  
Finding solace   
where nature infused.  
At the edge,   
where land meets sea,  
Cosmos whispers,   
inspiring me.  
  
[verse 3]  
I gazed at the stars,   
in their timeless embrace,  
And realized my purpose,   
my unique place.  
A single note   
in the symphony of life,  
Contributing beauty,   
amid struggle and strife.  
  
[chorus]  
Reflecting on this path I've trod,  
Filled with gratitude,   
blessed by God.  
Dreams fuel our desires,  
Ignite our souls,   
set us on fire.  
  
[outro]  
Embrace passions,   
embrace dreams,  
Dance in moonlight,   
where magic gleams.  
Life's a canvas,   
awaiting art,  
Dreams are whispers,   
igniting the heart.  
  
[end]
