# Arouse Your Power of Faith  
A soulful blues-pop anthem inspired by the Lotus Sūtra (Chapter 15), delivered in a laid‑back 100 bpm swing groove. Over warm Rhodes piano, gently brushed drums, and tasteful guitar licks, the lyrics call listeners to ignite their inner spark of faith and practice patience in every act of kindness. This uplifting track blends earnest vocals with a steady rhythm to illustrate how service and compassion open the door to deeper wisdom and enlightenment.

Lyrics:   
[Verse 1] when the world feels lost and lonely when your voice is just a whisper in the night there’s a spark inside you, burning ready to shine that holy light  
[Pre‑Chorus] feel it rising like a river flowing through your heart again patience is the secret trigger let your kindness be the wind  
[Chorus] arouse your power of faith let your soul ignite this flame do good patiently through each day let the spirit call your name  
you will hear the dharma clear like you never heard before open hearts will draw it near bring enlightenment to all  
[Verse 2] every helping hand you offer sends a ripple through the stormy sea every time you lift another you unlock what’s meant to be  
[Pre‑Chorus] feel it rising like a river flowing through your heart again patience is the secret trigger let your kindness be the wind  
[Chorus] arouse your power of faith let your soul ignite this flame do good patiently through each day let the spirit call your name  
you will hear the dharma clear like you never heard before open hearts will draw it near bring enlightenment to all  
[Bridge] all the wisdom that you’re seeking lives inside the work you do every promise that you’re keeping brings the dharma closer to you  
[Chorus ×2] arouse your power of faith let your soul ignite this flame do good patiently through each day let the spirit call your name you will hear the dharma clear like you never heard before open hearts will draw it near bring enlightenment to all  
[Outro] arouse your power of faith let your soul ignite this flame (fade out on the last “flame” with that bluesy guitar lick)
