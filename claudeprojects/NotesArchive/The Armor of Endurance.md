**The Armor of Endurance**  
  
**1**  
**Within each soul where sorrows press,**  
**a hidden seed of wakefulness;**  
**no rank or name can fence it in—**  
**the Sutra says we’re kin to Zen.**  
  
**2**  
**Two bodhisattvas take the stage:**  
**a healer and a poet-sage.**  
**They lift their voices, calm and clear,**  
**and vow to guard what mortals fear.**  
  
**3**  
***“We’ll don the mail of patient grace;***  
***no spite nor stone can crack this case.***  
***Though future days grow cold and grim,***  
***our chanting keeps the Dharma’s hymn.”***  
  
**4**  
**Eight shining links lock plate to plate—**  
**Right View first sets the posture straight;**  
**Right Thought and Speech keep edges keen;**  
**Right Acts leave no corroding sheen;**  
**Right Work rejects all tarnished gold;**  
**Right Zeal still beats when nights turn cold;**  
**Mind-full, we polish every seam;**  
**Deep Focus seals the armored gleam.**  
  
**5**  
**Each jeer or blow is hammer-sound**  
**that rings the bell of truth around;**  
**impermanence, the anvil bright,**  
**reminds us storms give way to light.**  
  
**6**  
**And faith—the clasp that will not rust—**  
**turns hurt to mercy, fear to trust.**  
**Strap on this suit at break of day;**  
**let every step sing the armor’s sway. **
