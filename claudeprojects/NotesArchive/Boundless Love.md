# Boundless Love  
  
To conquer fears that strive to bind,  
Our souls do sing a fearless song,  
In unity, our hearts aligned,  
With boundless love, we all belong.  
  
We rise above adversity's test,  
Embrace the challenge, never falter,  
Unfurl our wings, with hope we're blessed,  
Resilient spirit, we exalter.  
  
Together, we shall overcome,  
And blaze a trail across the sky,  
Our lives a tapestry begun,  
With each resplendent stroke, we fly, fly.  
With each resplendent stroke, we fly, fly.  
With each resplendent stroke, we fly, fly.  
With each resplendent stroke, we fly, fly.  
With each resplendent stroke, we fly, fly.  
With each resplendent stroke, we fly, fly.
