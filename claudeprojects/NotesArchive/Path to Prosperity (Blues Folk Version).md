**(Verse 1)**

**(Verse 1)**   
Underneath the moonlight,   
Underneath the moonlight,   
I find my way, Sutra’s wisdom guides me,   
I find my way, Sutra’s wisdom guides me,   
every night and day. Life's a woven tapestry,   
every night and day. Life's a woven tapestry,   
compassion’s in my heart, Every breath and heartbeat,   
compassion’s in my heart, Every breath and heartbeat,   
plays its perfect part.  
plays its perfect part.

Nam-myoho-renge-kyo,   
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo,   
let the good vibes flow, Gratitude and presence,   
let the good vibes flow, Gratitude and presence,   
watch the garden grow. Karma in my footsteps, intentions pure and true, Balance in my spirit, harmony in all I do.  
**(Verse 2)** Morning sun is rising, count my blessings true, Set my clear intentions, know what I must do. In this present moment, mindfulness I find, Weaving threads of fortune, with a peaceful mind.
