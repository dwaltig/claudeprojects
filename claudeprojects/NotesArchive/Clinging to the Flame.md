**Lyrics:**  
**Verse 1:**   
A whisper in the darkness, a flicker in the night,   
Clinging to a melody, to keep my spirit bright.   
The flames they dance and flicker, like the beat of my heart,   
A restless, burning passion, right from the very start.  
  
**Chorus:**   
Oh, I'm walking through the fire, with my weary, calloused hand,   
Tending to my spirit’s garden, in this lonesome, barren land.   
When the shadows try to claim me, I’ll shine my light anew,   
Clinging to the music's promise, like the morning dew.  
  
**Verse 2:**   
The road is long and dusty, and the nights are cold and deep,   
But the fire in my soul, a sacred vow, I keep.   
I've seen the ashes falling, I've felt the searing pain,   
But every scar’s a story, in this hard and driving rain.   
And every twist and turn, has brought me closer to the light,   
A burning, guiding star, that shines within the night.  
  
**Bridge:**   
Tend to your spirit's embers, like a flame against the wind,   
Feed it with your passion's fuel, let the true light begin.   
For the fire that consumes us, is the fire that sets us free,   
Cling to the music's echo, let it burn eternally.   
Let it burn away the darkness, let it purify the soul,   
Let the music be the compass, that guides us to our goal.  
  
**Verse 3:** Now the dawn is breaking, through the smoke and through the haze, The fire’s left its mark, in a thousand different ways. But the warmth it gave still lingers, in the songs I’ve come to know, A beacon for the weary, in the afterglow. So I’ll keep the flame alive, though the winds may howl and scream, For the fire’s not just burning—it’s the fabric of my dream.  
  
**Chorus:** Oh, I'm walking through the fire, with my weary, calloused hand, Tending to my spirit’s garden, in this lonesome, barren land. When the shadows try to claim me, I’ll shine my light anew, Clinging to the music's promise, like the morning dew.  
  
**Outro:** So let the fire burn, let it light the way, Through the darkest nights, to the break of day. Cling to the flame, let it guide you home, For the fire’s in your heart, and you’re never alone. Never alone.
