# In Your Presence  
  
[Verse]  
In your presence I find peace  
Oh Lord  
Your teachings  
They guide me  
They light up my soul  
No longer enslaved by the chains of my mind  
In your words I find freedom  
Pure and divine  
  
[Verse]  
No more misled by the doctrines of lies  
I've found the truth in your words  
It's a beautiful prize  
No longer ruled by my impulse and desire  
In your teachings  
I find strength to rise higher  
  
[Chorus]  
In your presence  
I want to stay  
In your presence  
I find my way  
With every word  
My spirit's renewed  
In your presence  
I find peace so true  
I find peace so true

[Verse]  
In your presence   
In your presence   
I find peace  
So True  
So True  
So True  
Your teachings  
They guide me  
They light up my soul  
No longer enslaved by the chains of my mind  
In your words I find freedom  
Pure and divine  
  
[Verse]  
No more misled   
No more misled   
by the doctrines of lies  
I've found the truth   
I've found the truth   
in your words  
It's a beautiful prize  
No longer ruled   
No longer ruled   
by my impulse and desire  
In your teachings  
I find strength to rise higher  
  
[Chorus]  
In your presence  
I want to stay  
In your presence  
I find my way  
With every word  
My spirit's renewed  
In your presence  
I find peace.  
I find peace.  
I find peace.  
  
In your presence  
I find peace so true.  
I find peace so true.  
I find peace so true.
