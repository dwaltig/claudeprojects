# 🎵 “World Voice Blues” (The Listener’s Song)  
  
*A modern folk-blues parable of Avalokiteśvara — for all beings*  
  
**Tempo:** 78 BPM (slow shuffle, steady heartbeat)  
**Key:** A minor → resolves to A major on final chorus (symbolizing awakening)  
**Genre:** Folk-Blues / Americana / Contemplative Gospel  
**Mood:** Intimate, compassionate, quietly transcendent — “Delta streetlight meets temple bell.”  
**Style reference:** Son House × Tracy Chapman × Ben Harper — earthy groove, meditative pulse.

**VERSE 1 – The Noise**  
  
*(Finger-picked acoustic, low harmonica tone)*  
Mira worked the city wires, mixin’ sound for pay,  
Pulled hiss and hum from broken songs, tried to fade the pain away.  
But one night through her headphones came a whisper deep and wild—  
All the world was cryin’ out, like a thousand lonely child.  
  
⸻  
  
**CHORUS 1 – The Call**  
  
*(Fuller groove, brushed snare and upright bass join)*  
She heard the world voice singin’, hummin’ through the dark,  
Not a song of angels, just a million human sparks.  
And the more she tried to stop it, the louder mercy grew—  
The world was singin’ “I need you… and you can listen too.”  
  
⸻  
  
**VERSE 2 – The Turning**  
  
*(Add slide guitar, soft gospel organ drone)*  
She sat down by her console, tears upon the board,  
Said, “I can’t fix this endless hurt, I can only hold the chord.”  
She let the sorrow tremble till it turned to quiet light,  
And found that in the heart of pain there shone a kind delight.  
  
⸻  
  
**CHORUS 2 – The Hearing**  
  
*(Choir harmony enters — The William Altig Choir sound)*  
Now she hears the world voice singin’, through storm and subway roar,  
Every cry a rhythm knockin’ on compassion’s door.  
No need to chase Nirvana, no need for heaven’s cue—  
The Dharma’s hummin’ in the street, and it’s hummin’ inside you.  
  
⸻  
  
**BRIDGE – The Insight**  
  
*(Solo slide + harmonica interlude, then half-spoken verse)*  
The wise don’t rule by thunder, they listen like the sea;  
They don’t need power, just an ear that sets us free.  
All beings call each other, in voices rough or sweet—  
When you learn to really listen, that’s enlightenment on repeat.  
  
⸻  
  
**FINAL CHORUS – The Oceanic Vow**  
  
*(Modulate to A major; full band, gospel-blues energy; slow fade to silence)*  
Hear the world voice singin’, every breath and sigh,  
From the pain of broken people to the laughter in the sky.  
You ain’t small or helpless, you’re the ocean through and through—  
Every wave that lifts another is the world voice singin’ you.

🎧** Production Notes for Suno AI or Studio Session**  
  
**Overall Feel:**  
	•	**Warm, live-room sound** — wood-paneled intimacy.  
	•	**Dynamic arc**: start sparse (solo guitar + voice) → grow into layered ensemble with choir and gentle percussion.  
  
**Instrumentation:**  
	•	Acoustic guitar (fingerpicked, open A minor tuning)  
	•	Upright bass (soft walking line)  
	•	Slide guitar (resonator for soulful weep)  
	•	Harmonica (distant train-whistle echo, symbol of listening)  
	•	Brushed snare / tambourine (human heartbeat)  
	•	Optional Hammond-style organ pad for warmth  
	•	Background choir (mixed-gender, hushed but rising — representing “the thousand voices of compassion”)  
  
**Vocal Style:**  
	•	Lead: male, weathered, compassionate (Apollo-like timbre).  
	•	Deliver lines with lived empathy — part storyteller, part preacher.  
	•	Background vocals answer call-and-response (“World voice singin’,” “Hummin’ through the dark”).  
  
**Arrangement Vision:**  
	•	Verse 1 → minimal; Verse 2 → add slide & harmony; Bridge → half-spoken Dharma talk; Final chorus → bright major lift, choir swelling.  
	•	End with a single sustained A-major chord fading into environmental sounds (waves, wind, faint city noise).
