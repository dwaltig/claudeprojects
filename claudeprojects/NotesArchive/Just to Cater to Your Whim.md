# Just to Cater to Your Whim  
  
**"Just to Cater to Your Whim" - The William Altig Choir**  
  
Sometimes love looks like giving in. Sometimes compassion means meeting someone where they are, even when you know the path they're walking won't heal them. This song is about that impossible tightrope - when your heart can't bear to see someone suffer, so you bend to their comfort, knowing full well it's only temporary relief.  
  
"Just to Cater to Your Whim" explores the ancient Buddhist concept of expedient means through the lens of American blues and folk tradition. It's the story of a parent watching a child cling to what harms them, the impossible choice between truth and tenderness, between what heals and what soothes.  
  
This is an introduction to The William Altig Choir - where Buddhist wisdom meets the American roots music tradition. Where ancient teachings are translated into songs you can feel in your bones.  
  
Featuring intimate fingerpicked guitar, crying pedal steel, and vocals that confess more than they perform. This is blues as dharma, folk as philosophy, and a reminder that sometimes the hardest walk is the one where you don't yet know you're already held.  
  
**Production**: Acoustic blues ballad **Key themes**: Expedient means, parental love, enabling, compassion, difficult truths **Part of**: The William Altig Choir song cycle exploring Buddhist sutras through American music

**Verse 1** I see you hurting, see you holding on To something that ain't helping, but it feels so strong I know the truth would set you free But watching you suffer is killing me  
  
**Chorus** So I'll bend a little, just to ease your pain Tell you what you want to hear again and again I know it's wrong, but Lord, it's hard to win When I'm just trying to cater to your whim  
  
**Verse 2** The road to change is steep and long And I can't bear to see you struggling on So I'll meet you where you stand tonight Even if I know it ain't quite right  
  
**Chorus** Yeah, I'll bend a little, just to ease your pain Tell you what you want to hear again and again I know it's wrong, but Lord, it's hard to win When I'm just trying to cater to your whim  
  
**Bridge** Sometimes love looks like a compromise Sometimes truth gets tangled up in lies I'm walking this wire, trying not to fall Wanting to save you from it all  
  
**Verse 3** But sugar-coating won't heal your soul Even though my heart can't bear the toll One day you'll be ready, one day you'll see 'Til then I'm caught between what is and what should be  
  
**Final Chorus** So I'll bend a little, just to stop your pain Give you what you need, though nothing really changed This temporary comfort, this familiar sin Lord forgive me, I'm just catering to your whim Yeah, I'm just catering to your whim  
  
**Outro** (Hummed melody, trailing off with resignation)
