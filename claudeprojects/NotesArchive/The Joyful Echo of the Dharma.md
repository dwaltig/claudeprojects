# The Joyful Echo of the Dharma  
  
My latest work, "The Joyful Echo of the Dharma," is an a cappella masterpiece featuring the powerful voices of a female choir. Imagine Hera, the Queen of Heaven, leading the Valkyries in a celestial chorus—this is the sound that fills the heavens as I direct the host. Each note, each word, is crafted to resonate with the divine, inviting listeners to connect with the wisdom and light that flows through the Lotus Sutra.  
  
Join me on this musical pilgrimage, where the merit of joyful acceptance and the sharing of the Dharma echoes across the universe, guiding us all towards enlightenment.

Verse 1:  
In a world where wisdom shines,    
A young soul hears the sacred lines,    
With joy in heart, they rise to share,    
The teachings pure, beyond compare.    
Through forests deep, and cities wide,    
They carry forth the Buddha’s light.  
  
Chorus:   
Oh, the joyful echo spreads,    
From heart to heart, the Dharma threads,    
Fifty souls, with love embrace,    
The merit grows in endless grace.  
Beyond the gifts of gold and land,    
The Dharma’s touch, like grains of sand.  
  
Verse 2:    
A master gives, with open hand,    
Riches vast, through every land,    
Yet greater still, the merit won,    
By sharing wisdom, one by one.    
The fiftieth soul, in this long chain,    
Receives the truth, and ends all pain.  
  
Chorus:   
Oh, the joyful echo spreads,    
From heart to heart, the Dharma threads,    
Fifty souls, with love embrace,    
The merit grows in endless grace.  
Beyond the gifts of gold and land,    
The Dharma’s touch, like grains of sand.  
  
Bridge:    
In a fleeting moment, lives transform,    
In a fleeting moment, lives transform,    
In a fleeting moment, lives transform,    
From joy in truth, new paths are born,    
Each word, each verse, a beacon bright,    
Guiding souls to endless light.    
Oh, the joy that echoes far,    
Reaches where the Buddhas are.  
  
Verse 3:    
A gentle nudge, a kind invite,    
“Come, friend, and hear the Lotus bright,”    
This simple act, a seed is sown,    
In future lives, the fruit is known.    
Wisdom sharp, and beauty fair,    
From Dharma’s gift, beyond compare.  
  
Chorus:   
Oh, the joyful echo spreads,    
From heart to heart, the Dharma threads,    
Fifty souls, with love embrace,    
The merit grows in endless grace.  
Beyond the gifts of gold and land,    
The Dharma’s touch, like grains of sand.

Outro:    
So sing with joy, let voices soar,    
The Lotus Sutra evermore,    
In every heart, the light will grow,    
As we share the Dharma’s glow.    
The merit vast, beyond the stars,    
Guides us to the Buddha's arms.  
Guides us to the Buddha's arms.  
  
Our voices join the endless song,  
As we share the Dharma strong.  
The merit vast, beyond the stars,  
Leads us where the Buddhas are.  
Leads us where the Buddhas are.
