# The Simple Peaceful Way  
  
*(Slow acoustic blues, steady foot-tap beat)*  
  
**[Verse 1 – Keep a Gentle Heart]**  
Buddha said to Mañjuśrī,  
“Times get rough, don’t lose your way.  
If you teach the truth of life,  
Walk in peace each day.  
Hold a quiet flame inside,  
Let it guide your night and day.”  
  
**[Chorus – The Heart of the Path]**  
Lay those heavy labels down,  
Let them drift and fade away.  
Treat all people as one family,  
That’s the simple, peaceful way.  
  
**[Verse 2 – No Pride, No Ranking]**  
Don’t brag your road is higher,  
Don’t call another low.  
Every teaching is a lantern,  
Helping hearts to grow.  
When you drop the grab for glory,  
Real freedom starts to show.  
  
**[Chorus – The Heart of the Path]**  
Lay those heavy labels down,  
Let them drift and fade away.  
Treat all people as one family,  
That’s the simple, peaceful way.  
  
**[Verse 3 – Beyond All Names]**  
Don’t say “this is man” or “woman,”  
Don’t draw a border line.  
The deepest self has no name—  
All beings shine the same.  
Open eyes of kindness see  
One vast, endless sky.  
  
**[Bridge – The Quiet Change]**  
Old habits lose their power,  
Fear and fight grow small.  
Calm like a wide blue river,  
You care for one and all.  
  
**[Outro]**  
The Bodhisattva’s song is gentle,  
Rolling soft and free.  
Drop the walls, let wisdom rise—  
That’s the way to be.
