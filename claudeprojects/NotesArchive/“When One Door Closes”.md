Lyrics:   
**Verse 1**  
When one door closes, heavy with doubt (Oh, heavy with doubt)  
I stand in the storm, trying to figure it out (Figure it out)  
But there’s a light in the distance, a soft glowing sign  
A new road ahead, gonna be mine  
  
**Chorus**  
Oh, the winds may blow, but I’ll hold strong   
Better days are comin’, won’t be long   
From the shadows of worry, hope will rise  
A brighter tomorrow, right before my eyes  
  
**Verse 2**  
The waters get rough, but I won’t drown (No, I won’t drown)  
I’ve been here before, and I’ve turned it around (Turned it around)  
Each fall is a lesson, each step a climb  
The rhythm of life, just keeping time  
  
**Chorus**  
Oh, the winds may blow, but I’ll hold strong  
Better days are comin’, won’t be long  
From the shadows of worry, hope will rise  
A brighter tomorrow, right before my eyes  
  
**Instrumental break (fiddle solo)**  
  
**Reprise Verse 2**  
The waters get rough, but I won’t drown (No, I won’t drown)  
I’ve been here before, and I’ve turned it around (Turned it around)  
Each fall is a lesson, each step a climb  
The rhythm of life, just keeping time  
  
**Bridge**  
Oh, I’ve walked through the fire, but I’m still here (I’m still here)  
Every scar’s a story, every tear’s clear (tear’s clear)  
The road may be long, but my spirit won’t fade  
I’m stronger now from the choices I’ve made  
  
**Chorus**  
Oh, the winds may blow, but I’ll hold strong  
Better days are comin’, won’t be long  
From the shadows of worry, hope will rise  
A brighter tomorrow, right before my eyes  
  
**Outro**  
The door may close, but I’m not done (I’m not done)  
A brighter path is just begun (just begun)  
I’ll keep on walkin’, with hope as my guide  
With the winds at my back, and nothing to hide  
  
**[Instrumental outro:fiddle leading]**
