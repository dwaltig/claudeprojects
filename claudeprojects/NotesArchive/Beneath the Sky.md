(Verse 1)  
In a meadow where the river flows,  
Under skies where the soft wind blows,  
There bloom six buds of ancient art,  
Whispering truth deep in your heart.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, come along and sing the tune,  
Of the Buddha’s path beneath the moon,  
Sixfold wisdom, clear and bright—  
Guide our souls through day and night.  
  
(Verse 2)  
The first bud sprouts in a quiet mind,  
A seed of stillness, gentle and kind;  
The second shines with love so true,  
A mirror of care for me and you.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, come along and sing the tune,  
Of the Buddha’s path beneath the moon,  
Sixfold wisdom, clear and bright—  
Guide our souls through day and night.  
  
(Verse 3)  
The third bud shows the dance of life,  
Where form and void are free of strife;  
The fourth reveals our inner light,  
A call to awaken in the night.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, come along and sing the tune,  
Of the Buddha’s path beneath the moon,  
Sixfold wisdom, clear and bright—  
Guide our souls through day and night.  
  
(Verse 4)  
The fifth bud brings us side by side,  
Uniting hearts in the rising tide;  
The sixth bestows a peace so grand,  
A promise of love across the land.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, come along and sing the tune,  
Of the Buddha’s path beneath the moon,  
Sixfold wisdom, clear and bright—  
Guide our souls through day and night.  
  
(Bridge)  
So let the music fill the air,  
With gentle truth and heartfelt care;  
In every note, a mindful call—  
For the world to rise, one and all.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, come along and sing the tune,  
Of the Buddha’s path beneath the moon,  
Sixfold wisdom, clear and bright—  
Guide our souls through day and night.  
  
(Outro)  
In the meadow where the river flows,  
May the seeds of wisdom ever grow;  
Let this song be your guiding light,  
To a heart awakened and ever bright.
