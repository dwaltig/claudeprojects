# A Quiet Strength  
A quiet strength, a heart that knows,  
The winds of change, the ebb and flows.  
Endurance wears a gentle grace,  
A steady spirit in this space.  
  
Patience, more than waiting still,  
A choice of mind, a steadfast will.  
To meet the storm with open hand,  
And find the wisdom in the sand.  
  
The perfections bloom, a fragrant row,  
Where giving, virtue gently grow.  
With effort joyful, spirits bright,  
And wisdom guiding towards the light.  
  
Like armor strong, these virtues bind,  
Protecting heart and thoughtful mind.  
Through hardship's fire, they see us through,  
To peace and understanding, fresh and new.  
  
So let us walk this noble way,  
Embrace the lessons of each day.  
With patient hearts and spirits bold,  
A beauty in this wisdom to unfold.
