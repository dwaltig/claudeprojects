# Times Sweet Sway  
  
*“Time’s Sweet Sway”* is a poetic blues folk song that embraces the mystery and rhythm of time. With a gentle groove and lyrical grace, this track turns every tick of the clock into music—curving, bending, and echoing through memory and feeling. It’s not about controlling time, but dancing with it.  
  
Through shimmering guitar strings and soul-soaked vocals, the song invites listeners to let go of linear thinking and feel the sway—how time warps under love, fate, and the sheer weight of being alive. A meditation in melody, “Time’s Sweet Sway” reminds us that beauty lingers in the fleeting.

Lyrics:   
[Verse]  
The clock it shivers and shakes  
Each tick a ripple it makes  
Time ain't no straight line to run  
It curves and grooves under the sun  
  
[Verse 2]  
A second’s a wink then it's gone  
Yesterday lingers all night long  
Moments leap like skipping stones  
Echoes hum through my bones  
  
[Chorus]  
Time bends like a sweet guitar string  
Each note a memory that sings  
It ain't cruel it just flows  
Where it stops nobody knows  
  
[Verse 3]  
Dreams crawl back with no remorse  
The past and future change their course  
A lifetime dances on the breeze  
Knees are weak at mysteries  
  
[Bridge]  
Hear that ticking it ain't straight  
Warped by love anger and fate  
A melody we can't contain  
Time's just music in our veins  
  
[Chorus]  
Time bends like a sweet guitar string  
Each note a memory that sings  
It ain't cruel it just flows  
Where it stops nobody knows
