During our time together, your son expressed curiosity about how he’s perceived in school, particularly in terms of his academic standing. I took this opportunity to emphasize the importance of not only meeting but exceeding expectations. In our learning community, we deeply value students who go beyond the minimum requirements–those who bring added value and demonstrate a proactive approach to their learning.

I believe your son has the potential to be one of these students. With your support, I am confident we can encourage him to embrace challenges and strive for excellence, not just in academics but in all areas of his life. Let’s work together to guide him towards realizing his full potential and being recognized for his extra efforts and contributions.  
  
Thank you for your continued support and involvement in his educational journey.  
  
Warm regards,
