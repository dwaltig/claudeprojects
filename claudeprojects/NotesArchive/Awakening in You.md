[Lyrics:]  
  
(Verse 1)  
In a world so grand and wide,  
I walk with open eyes,  
Seeing the light in everyone,  
No matter the disguise.  
With a gentle heart, I say,  
To strangers on my way,  
“I revere you, each and all,  
In you, Awakening calls.”  
  
(Chorus)  
I see Awakening in you,  
In everything you do,  
A sacred light that shines so bright,  
In me and you, it’s true.  
With compassion as my guide,  
And kindness by my side,  
I see Awakening in you,  
Together, we’ll see it through.  
  
(Verse 2)  
When the world is fierce and cold,  
And the days feel dark and old,  
I’ll hold onto this faith,  
That in each heart, there’s grace.  
With respect and love so deep,  
These promises I’ll keep,  
To honor every soul I meet,  
And never know defeat.  
  
(Chorus)  
I see Awakening in you,  
In everything you do,  
A sacred light that shines so bright,  
In me and you, it’s true.  
With compassion as my guide,  
And kindness by my side,  
I see Awakening in you,  
Together, we’ll see it through.  
  
(Bridge)  
In the shadows and the light,  
In the wrongs and in the rights,  
I’ll hold this vision clear,  
That Awakening’s always near.  
With each step and every breath,  
In life, in love, in death,  
I’ll sing this song of hope,  
To help us all to cope.  
  
(Chorus)  
I see Awakening in you,  
In everything you do,  
A sacred light that shines so bright,  
In me and you, it’s true.  
With compassion as my guide,  
And kindness by my side,  
I see Awakening in you,  
Together, we’ll see it through.  
  
(Outro)  
So, remember this, my friend,  
From now until the end,  
Awakening’s light is in us all,  
In every rise and fall.  
With a heart that’s pure and true,  
I’ll always see Awakening in you.
