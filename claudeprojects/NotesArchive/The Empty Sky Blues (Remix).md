# The Empty Sky Blues (Remix)  
  
Folk, Blues, Pop, start with a tempo of 60-80 BPM, As the song progresses to the verses about "letting go" and the "breakthrough of wisdom," a slightly more driving tempo (80-100 BPM)   
  
(Verse 1: The Ache of Existence - Dukkha & Samudaya)  
(Mood: Melancholy, reflective, a sense of restless longing. Simple, repeating chord progression, slow, strummed guitar or harmonica)  
Got that deep down ache, can't quite say why,  
Under every sweet breeze, hear a mournful sigh.  
Chasin' shadows down a dusty road,  
Always wanting more than my hands can hold.  
Every joy a whisper, fading in the light,  
Every perfect moment, gone into the night.  
(Pre-Chorus/Bridge 1: A Glimmer of Understanding - Dharma's Whisper)  
(Mood: Introspective, a moment of dawning realization or a hint of a different way)  
Then I heard a whisper, an ancient, gentle call,  
Said 'Truth ain't hidin', it's in the rise and fall'.  
Don't need no grand design, no heaven far above,  
Just listen to the rhythm, the universal love.  
(Chorus: The Core Aspiration - Universal Buddhahood)  
(Mood: Uplifting, determined, compassionate, catchy melody, strong vocal delivery, memorable lyrics)  
Oh, if I can find my light, and chase away the night,  
Then I will show the way, for every soul today.  
If I can reach that wisdom, shining clear and true,  
Others too will follow, me and you.  
(Verse 2: The Path of Letting Go - Noble Eightfold Path, Anatta)  
(Mood: Reflective, a sense of effort and clarity, but also liberation. Slightly more driving rhythm)  
Tried to build my fortress, tried to hold it tight,  
But every wall just crumbles, in the changing light.  
Thought I knew 'who I was,' a solid, steady thing,  
But the mirror's just a ripple, on a restless wing.  
Gotta watch my words now, make my actions kind,  
Gotta clear the clutter, from my tangled mind.  
(Bridge 2: The Breakthrough of Wisdom - Prajñā & Śūnyatā)  
(Mood: Transformative, deeply insightful, a feeling of vastness and liberation. Build-up, shift in instrumentation)  
Saw the veil was lifting, a new kind of sight,  
Not a thing to grasp at, just the endless light.  
Emptiness ain't lonely, it's the space where all can be,  
Breaking every tether, setting my spirit free.  
(Chorus - repeated with more conviction)  
Oh, if I can find my light, and chase away the night,  
Then I will show the way, for every soul today.  
If I can reach that wisdom, shining clear and true,  
Others too will follow, me and you.  
(Outro: The Ripple Effect - Bodhisattva Ideal, Skillful Means, Sangha)  
(Mood: Hopeful, expansive, emphasizing community and universal compassion. Fades out with a lingering, hopeful melody, final strum or repeated vocal line)  
Like the sixteen princes, in a story told so old,  
Gave up all their treasures, for a wisdom made of gold.  
Now they shine their lanterns, across every shore,  
Different words, same meaning, knocking on every door.  
And the community gathers, strong and true and deep,  
Sharing every burden, while the Dharma softly sleeps.  
The empty sky... it opens wide... for you and me... and all mankind.
