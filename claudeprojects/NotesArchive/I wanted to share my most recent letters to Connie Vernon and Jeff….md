Dear Connie Vernon and Jeff Douglas,  
  
I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to share my observations and concerns following the HOA meeting held on Monday, 02/12/2024. It is with a sense of responsibility that I report my disappointment in the conduct observed during the meeting, specifically regarding the interaction between Connie Vernon, our Community Manager representative, and a member of our board.  
  
During the discussion, it was apparent that Connie's reaction to the board member's comments was noticeably negative. This included physical signs of agitation, such as shrugging shoulders and clenched fists, as well as verbal interruptions, including requests for the board member to stop speaking and accusations of raising their voice. These actions culminated in an environment not conducive to open and respectful dialogue, which I believe is fundamental to the success of our meetings.  
  
I did intervene during the meeting to request that the board member be allowed to finish speaking, as I strongly believe in ensuring that all voices are heard without interruption or disparagement. Respectful communication is crucial in our community, and it is disappointing to witness interactions that deviate from this principle.  
  
Additionally, after the meeting, while Connie did offer an apology to Denise and myself, it was concerning to hear her attribute her reactions to the behavior of the board member, rather than taking full responsibility for her own actions. Such responses do not align with the professional conduct we expect from our HOA management team.  
  
I understand that managing a community like ours can be challenging and that disagreements may arise. However, it is essential that we address these challenges with maturity and professionalism, ensuring that all members feel heard and respected.  
  
Moving forward, I commit to documenting any further instances of concern to ensure that we are working towards a community that embodies respect and open communication. I am also open to discussing any insights or feedback that Connie or Jeff may have regarding this situation or how we can collectively improve our community interactions.  
  
Thank you for your attention to this matter and your dedication to our community. I look forward to working together to address these concerns.  
  
Best regards,  
  
William Altig

As the current leader of our Homeowners' Association (HOA), I have taken the responsibility to address and reflect upon the feedback received from our community members regarding the performance of our management representative. This review is based on consistent observations and documented interactions over a period of time.  
  
**Professionalism and Conduct:** There have been numerous instances where the behavior exhibited by our representative fell short of the professionalism expected in their role. This has been a concern for many within our community, prompting discussions on how we can foster a more positive and productive working relationship.  
  
**Responsiveness and Accountability:** A key issue that has emerged involves the representative’s handling of their duties and responsibilities. Phrases such as "I didn't do it," "It's not my responsibility," and "I never said that" have been recurrent, despite the presence of witnesses and documented evidence to the contrary. This approach not only undermines accountability but also erodes trust between the management and the community members.  
  
In conclusion, our community deserves a management representative who upholds the highest standards of professionalism and accountability. We are committed to working together to address these issues and to ensure that our HOA operates in the best interest of all members. We hope to see positive changes that reflect a mutual respect and understanding between the management and the community.
