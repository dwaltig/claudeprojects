# Miracles of the Spirit  
  
Miracles are whispers, woven in light,  
Not bound by the world, yet hidden in sight.  
They dance in the air, they shimmer, they fade,  
Not tricks of the hand, but truths conveyed.  
  
To rise without weight, to lift from the ground,  
Is not to defy, but to know what is found.  
Levitation—no burden, no chain—  
The spirit unshackled from worry and pain.  
  
The winds and the waters, the fire, the stone,  
Bow to the heart that has mastered its own.  
For storms are but echoes of tempests inside,  
And peace is the eye where the true powers hide.  
  
To shift and to change, to alter one’s face,  
Is more than illusion, but dance within space.  
The world is a current, the self but a stream,  
A flowing mosaic, a vanishing dream.  
  
So marvel, if you must, at wonders untold,  
At fire in the hands and the water turned gold.  
Yet know that the greatest of powers revealed  
Are hearts that are weightless, and wounds that are healed.
