## The Vow, The Foe, and The Final Crew  
  
The Buddha spoke, "I’m leaving soon; the world will turn to night,   
Who will guard my teaching, and keep the truth alight?"    
  
A million bright disciples, from shining worlds afar,   
Stepped up and made a promise, reaching for a star.  
  
**The Messenger's Promise (Chapter 13):**   
"We are your loyal messengers, so do not worry now!   
We’ll spread the sacred Dharma, fulfilling this strong vow.   
We swear we will be **fearless**—no crowd can make us run—   
We will fight the darkness, until the battle's won."    
  
They knew the future world would be a hard and evil age,   
Filled with three kinds of bullies that filled them up with rage:  
  
**The Three Types of Trouble:**   
The first were **arrogant people**, who’d curse and start a fight,   
The second were the jealous, **religious priests**, full of spite.    
And last, the cunning **false leaders**, who’d use the king’s command,   
To exile and attack them throughout the troubled land.    
  
But the messengers declared, “We won’t let our bodies live,   
If that’s the price we pay, for all the truth to give!”    
  
**The Big Twist:**   
But the Buddha shook his head, though their spirits shone so bright,   
He said their ties were shallow, a **“superficial”** light.    
  
To save this world of suffering, the promise wasn't done;   
The greatest job required the deep connection of his own.  
  
**The True Heroes (Chapter 15):**   
Then the earth began to rumble, splitting wide apart,   
And the Buddha’s oldest students emerged with a golden heart.    
  
They were the **Bodhisattvas of the Earth**, the original, true team,   
The only ones who held the bond to fulfill the final dream.    
  
They alone were qualified to finish the great task,   
Because their tie to *this* world was stronger than any could ask!
