In endless fields,   
In endless fields,   
we chase the truth,  
A winding path,   
A winding path,   
beneath the sky so blue.  
No final stop,   
No final stop,   
just souls to save,  
A timeless quest,   
A timeless quest,   
beyond the grave.  
  
With each new dawn,   
With each new dawn,   
we rise to mend,  
On roads of self-improvement   
On roads of self-improvement   
without end.  
Chasing joy through   
Chasing joy through   
night and day,  
With every step,   
With every step,   
we find our way.  
  
Oh, the strongest force,   
Oh, the strongest force,   
joy unfurled,  
Nothing's stronger   
Nothing's stronger   
in this world.  
Heaven and earth,   
Heaven and earth,   
they too confess,  
In the power of happiness.  
  
Sakyamuni’s words,   
Sakyamuni’s words,   
old and wise,  
A beacon through   
A beacon through   
our earthly ties.  
In joy we trust,   
In joy we trust,   
in joy we thrive,  
With happiness,   
With happiness,   
our souls alive.  
  
Oh, the strongest force,   
Oh, the strongest force,   
joy unfurled,  
Nothing's stronger   
Nothing's stronger   
in this world.  
Heaven and earth,   
Heaven and earth,   
they too confess,  
In the power of happiness.
