# I Offer This Lotus  
  
[Verse]  
I offer this lotus to the Buddha bright  
Seeking nothing back  
Not even light  
In the stillness  
A silent night  
Awaken me  
In the dawn's soft bite  
  
[Verse 2]  
No riches or gold for my humble plea  
Just the whispering wind in an endless sea  
I bow and surrender  
Let go of me  
To be free from the chains  
Let it be  
  
[Chorus]  
Supreme awakening  
No more goals to chase  
In the heart of stillness  
I find my place  
Where the mind is quiet  
And the soul's embraced  
With the Buddha's light  
I erase  
  
[Verse 3]  
In the shadows of the temple deep  
Where the breaths are slow  
The secrets keep  
I offer this lotus  
And in faith  
I leap  
Into the unknown  
Where the wise ones sleep  
  
[Verse 4]  
The journey's long  
Yet my spirit's strong  
With the Buddha's calm  
I belong  
No more battles  
No rights or wrongs  
In the lotus bloom  
I hear the song  
  
[Chorus]  
Supreme awakening  
No more goals to chase  
In the heart of stillness  
I find my place  
Where the mind is quiet  
And the soul's embraced  
With the Buddha's light  
I erase  
  
  
** I Offer This Lotus**  
  
**[Verse 1]**  
I offer this lotus to the Buddha bright,  
Seeking nothing back, not even light.  
In the stillness vast, where silence takes flight,  
Awaken me in the dawn’s soft bite.  
  
**[Verse 2]**  
No riches to give, no gold to plea,  
Just the whispering winds and an endless sea.  
I bow and surrender, release what’s “me,”  
To break these chains and set my soul free.  
  
**[Chorus]**  
Supreme awakening, no more goals to chase,  
In the heart of stillness, I find my place.  
Where the mind is quiet, and the soul’s embraced,  
By the Buddha’s light, all sorrow erased.  
  
**[Verse 3]**  
In shadows deep, where the temple sighs,  
Where breath slows low and truth abides,  
I offer this lotus, my faith untied,  
Leaping into wisdom where the wise reside.  
  
**[Verse 4]**  
The path is long, yet my spirit grows,  
Through the Buddha’s calm, a peace that flows.  
No battles remain, no rights, no woes,  
In the lotus bloom, the eternal song glows.  
  
**[Chorus]**  
Supreme awakening, no more goals to chase,  
In the heart of stillness, I find my place.  
Where the mind is quiet, and the soul’s embraced,  
By the Buddha’s light, all sorrow erased.
