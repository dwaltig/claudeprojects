# "The Lowest Gate"  
  
## A Universal Spiritual Folk Song  
**[Verse 1]**   
Old man climbed that mountain high Forty years of silence, reachin' for the sky Counted every breath, mapped every star But the simplest truth? It weren't that far  
  
**[Chorus]**   
The highest teaching for the lowest stage The deepest water for the common wage Ain't about how smart you are, or how long you pray The truest door swings open for the lost and the strayed (Yeah, the lowest gate is the widest made)  
  
**[Verse 2]**   
Ancient teacher told about a burning house Children playin' games, smoke rollin' out Promised 'em three carts to get 'em outside But gave 'em one great wagon when they reached the light  
  
**[Chorus]**  
The highest teaching for the lowest stage The deepest water for the common wage Ain't about how smart you are, or how long you pray The truest door swings open for the lost and the strayed (Yeah, the lowest gate is the widest made)  
  
**[Bridge - spoken word over sparse guitar]**   
Now the old masters said something strange Something that'll rearrange How you think salvation works— "The complicated path requires the higher capacity But the perfect teaching? That's for you and me"  
  
**[Verse 3]**   
Don't need no holy language, don't need no throne The sacred fire lives inside your bones You can't earn what you already got Just plug into the power, friend—that's the whole plot  
  
**[Verse 4]**   
Through the ages, some caught that flame Said "the world's on fire, ain't nobody to blame But the medicine's too complicated for these times Just call the name of Love—that's your lifeline"  
  
**[Final Chorus - build]**   
The highest teaching for the lowest stage The deepest water for the common wage Ain't about how smart you are, how pure, how strong The truest door swings open—you belonged all along (Yeah, the lowest gate lets everyone in) (The lowest gate is where we all begin)  
  
**[Outro - call and response]**   
Lead: *Who can touch the sacred ground?* Response: *The beggar's son* Lead: *Who can find the holy mind?* Response: *Anyone, anyone* Lead: *What's the hardest path to walk?* Response: *The easy one* Lead: *What's the easiest truth to hold?* Response: *The deepest one*
