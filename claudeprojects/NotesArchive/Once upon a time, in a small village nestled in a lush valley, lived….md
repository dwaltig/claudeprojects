Once upon a time, in a small village nestled in a lush valley, lived two young boys named Can and Can't. These boys were not too different in appearance, but their hearts held very different beliefs.  
Can believed he could do anything he set his mind to, and his heart was filled with hope and determination. He took on challenges with great enthusiasm and always gave his best effort, even when the task was difficult. With every success, Can's belief in himself grew stronger and brighter.  
Can't, on the other hand, believed he was unable to accomplish anything of value. His heart was clouded with doubt and fear, which weighed heavily upon him. Every task seemed like a giant mountain he could not climb, and so he surrendered before even trying.  
One day, the village chief announced a competition to scale a nearby mountain, with a reward waiting at the top for whoever reached it first. Can and Can't both heard the news and contemplated whether to join the challenge.  
Can, fueled by belief in himself, eagerly signed up for the competition. He faced the steep mountain slopes, endured harsh winds, and battled fatigue with unyielding determination. With each step, Can's belief in himself grew stronger, and soon, he found himself standing at the summit, victorious.  
Can't, however, was hesitant to participate. As he watched Can triumphantly scale the mountain, his own heart was consumed by doubt. He could not bring himself to join the competition, convinced that he would fail.  
The villagers praised Can's bravery and perseverance, while Can't remained in the shadows, unrecognized and uncelebrated.  
And so the story of Can and Can't teaches us that the beliefs we hold deep in our hearts can shape our paths and our destinies. Believe you can, or believe you can't – the choice is yours, but know that it is a choice of great consequence.
