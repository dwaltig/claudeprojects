I've been working on a musical project that I'm really excited to share with you. It's called "The Lotus Sutra in Folk" and it's a collection of songs inspired by the parables, stories, and analogies from the Lotus Sutra.  
Each song is a unique blend of folk melodies and bluesy soul, bringing the teachings of compassion, enlightenment, and the Buddha-nature to life in a way that's both relatable and inspiring. I hope you'll take a listen and see what resonates with you.
