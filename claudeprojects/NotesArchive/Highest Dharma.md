# Highest Dharma  
  
From Earth's deep heart, where mysteries lie,   
**Bodhisattvas rise**, a **vast multitude**, beneath the sky  
No longer veiled, the **Highest Dharma** gleams,   
The **Buddha's own mind**, beyond all dreams.  
  
His life, unmeasured, spans all time and space,   
A timeless display of wisdom, love, and grace.   
**Expedient means** now cast aside their shell,   
**One Vehicle** unveiled, where all may dwell.  
  
For **universal Buddhahood** is our true might,   
To listen **'with all hearts,'** embrace the light.   
**Hear every whisper**, profound emotion's call  
**Transforming suffering**, standing strong and tall  
In **Samsara's** chaos, **Nirvana's** found,   
With **vibrant courage**, on resilient ground.  
  
A **strategy** for life, a fearless way,   
To claim our **noble life state**, come what may.   
This **ultimate teaching**, pure and profound,   
A **resilient spirit**, forever unbound  
Through **faith** and **practice**, **true happiness** found.
