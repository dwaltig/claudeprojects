You're right, the Noble Eightfold Path does indeed emphasize the value of endurance and patience, which are also central to the Buddhist perfections (paramitas). While the Noble Eightfold Path outlines the steps for liberation, the perfections represent the qualities a practitioner cultivates along this path.  
Endurance and patience are most clearly aligned with Right Effort (samyak-vyāyāma), the sixth element of the Noble Eightfold Path.Right Effort involves diligently cultivating wholesome qualities and abandoning unwholesome ones.This requires sustained effort and perseverance in the face of challenges, both internal (like negative emotions) and external.  
In the context of the perfections, Patience (kshanti) is a crucial virtue.It's more than just tolerating hardship; it encompasses forbearance, acceptance, and the ability to remain unaffected by adversity without succumbing to anger or negativity.This cultivation of inner strength is essential for maintaining Right Effort on the path, especially when facing difficulties in one's practice or in daily life.  
The connection can be seen in how Right Effort encourages the practitioner to prevent negative states of mind from arising and to abandon those that have already arisen.This process often requires patience with oneself and with the unfolding of one's practice.Endurance, in this context, is the steadfastness needed to continue practicing the Eightfold Path even when progress feels slow or obstacles appear.  
Furthermore, the development of other aspects of the Eightfold Path also fosters endurance and patience. For example, Right Mindfulness (samyak-smṛti) involves paying attention to the present moment without judgment.This practice cultivates a greater acceptance of reality as it is, which is a key aspect of patience.Similarly, Right Resolve (samyak-saṃkalpa) encourages intentions of non-violence and harmlessness , which naturally aligns with the patient and forbearing nature of kshanti.  
Ultimately, the Noble Eightfold Path, through its emphasis on Right Effort and the cultivation of wisdom and ethical conduct, inherently teaches the value of endurance and patience as necessary qualities for progressing towards liberation from suffering.These qualities, also embodied in the paramita of patience, empower practitioners to navigate the challenges of the path with resilience and equanimity.
