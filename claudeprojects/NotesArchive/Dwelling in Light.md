(Verse 1)   
Quiet heart, seeking solace, yearning for a guide,   
Whispers echo through the ages, "Lord, who may abide?"   
In Your holy presence, on that sacred ground,   
Who can stand, unwavering, where grace is found?  
  
(Chorus)   
Speak the truth, let your words be pure,   
(Speak the truth, let our words be pure,)   
Harm no soul, let compassion endure.   
(Harm no soul, let compassion endure.)   
Honor those who walk in reverence and awe,   
(Honor those who walk in reverence and awe,)   
Reject the wicked, uphold good's law.   
(Reject the wicked, uphold good's law.)  
  
(Verse 2)   
Keep your promises, though trials may test,   
Seek no gain at innocence's behest.   
Stand for truth, let your spirit ascend,   
A dwelling in light, where shadows end.  
  
(Bridge) Djembe beats a rhythm, ancient and profound,   
Oud's lament whispers secrets, heaven-bound.   
Sitar's melody weaves a tapestry divine,   
Flutes of the Andes rejoice, hearts intertwine.  
  
[Instrumental: Djembe, Oud, Sitar, Flute]  
  
(Chorus: Call and Response)   
Speak the truth, let your words be pure,   
(Speak the truth, let our words be pure,)   
Harm no soul, let compassion endure.   
(Harm no soul, let compassion endure.)   
Honor those who walk in reverence and awe,   
(Honor those who walk in reverence and awe,)   
Reject the wicked, uphold good's law.   
(Reject the wicked, uphold good's law.)  
  
(Outro)   
In this fusion of voices, a symphony of grace,   
We find our dwelling, a sacred space.   
Where love and justice forever entwine,   
Dwelling in light, eternally shine.
