Like seeds we sow in fertile ground,   
May our good deeds take root and bloom.   
Across this vast and wondrous world,   
May compassion fill every room.  
  
Not for ourselves alone we strive,   
But for all beings, great and small.   
May our hearts open wide,   
And love's light shine on all.  
  
From whispers soft to joyful song,   
May kindness be our guiding light.   
In every step we take,   
May we walk towards a future bright.  
  
We offer up our hearts and hands,   
To build a world where love commands.   
Seeds of hope we plant today,   
For a brighter, kinder, better way.  
  
Through trials and triumphs we will stand,   
United in our shared desire.   
To heal the wounds, to mend the broken,   
And set every soul afire.  
  
Let the drums of unity beat,   
And voices rise in harmony.   
Across the lands, across the seas,   
We are one, boundless and free.  
  
We offer up our hearts and hands,   
To build a world where love commands.   
Seeds of hope we plant today,   
For a brighter, kinder, better way.  
  
May the light within us shine so bright,   
That darkness fades and takes its flight.   
In every act of love we share,   
A better world we'll build, we swear.  
  
We offer up our hearts and hands,   
To build a world where love commands.   
Seeds of hope we plant today,   
For a brighter, kinder, better way.  
  
We offer up our hearts and hands,   
To build a world where love commands.   
Seeds of hope we plant today,   
For a brighter, kinder, better way.  
  
May the light within us shine so bright,   
That darkness fades and takes its flight.   
In every act of love we share,   
A better world we'll build, we swear.
