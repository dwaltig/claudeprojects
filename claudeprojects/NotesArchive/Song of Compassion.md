# Song of Compassion  
  
Verse 1:  
In times of trouble,   
In times of trouble,   
you seem so far away,  
Why do the wicked prosper,   
Why do the wicked prosper,   
why do the helpless pay?  
In their pride, they hunt the weak,   
In their pride, they hunt the weak,   
with schemes that lead astray,  
But in the silence of the night,   
But in the silence of the night,   
I know you hear us pray.  
  
Chorus:  
Chorus:  
Arise, O Lord,   
hear our plea,  
Let justice flow like a mighty sea.  
In the Lotus light,   
we'll take our stand,  
Compassion guiding   
heart and hand.  
heart and hand.  
  
Verse 2:  
The Bodhisattvas see our tears,   
The Bodhisattvas see our tears,   
and work to ease the pain,  
Their compassion like a river,   
Their compassion like a river,   
flowing through the rain.  
Though the wicked boast and scheme,   
Though the wicked boast and scheme,   
in the shadows of disdain,  
Karma’s wheel is turning,   
Karma’s wheel is turning,   
bringing balance once again.

In the darkness,   
In the darkness,   
faith burns bright,  
Compassion leads us to the light.

salvation's call,  
Inner strength to conquer all.

Verse 3:  
Defending the oppressed,   
Defending the oppressed,   
the fatherless you hear,  
Encouraging the weary,   
Encouraging the weary,   
drying every tear.  
With the wisdom of the Sutra,   
With the wisdom of the Sutra,   
our path becomes clear,  
Justice for the broken,   
Justice for the broken,   
love will conquer fear.

Together we’ll find peace,   
in the promised land.

Your lyrics are already quite strong and evocative, blending elements of different spiritual traditions with themes of justice, compassion, and hope. Here are some suggestions to potentially enhance the lyrics:  
  
1. Consistency in imagery: Consider focusing more on either the Buddhist or Judeo-Christian imagery, or find a way to more seamlessly blend them.  
  
2. Tighten the rhythm: Some lines could be adjusted to flow more smoothly with a typical folk blues rhythm.  
  
3. Strengthen the chorus: The chorus is good, but you might consider making it more memorable or impactful.  
  
4. Enhance the bridge: The bridge could be made more distinct from the verses.  
  
Here's a revised version of the chorus and bridge as an example:  
  
Revised Chorus:  
Arise, O Lord, hear our plea,  
Let justice flow like a mighty sea.  
In the Lotus light, we'll take our stand,  
Compassion guiding heart and hand.  
  
Revised Bridge:  
(Spoken/Chanted)  
In the darkness, faith burns bright,  
Compassion leads us to the light.  
The Dharma's wisdom, salvation's call,  
Inner strength to conquer all.  
  
These are just suggestions. Your original lyrics are already quite good, and any changes should align with your vision for the song and its message.
