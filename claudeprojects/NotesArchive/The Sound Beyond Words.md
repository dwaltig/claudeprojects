# The Sound Beyond Words   
*(A Folk Blues for the Lotus Path)*  
  
Sometimes the deepest truths can't be explained—they have to be sung.  
This folk blues track takes ancient Buddhist wisdom from the Lotus Sutra and translates it into American roots music. It's about that moment when thinking stops and something deeper takes over. When the sound itself becomes the teaching.  
The Buddha said his wisdom was too vast for words. So he gave us something better: a practice, a rhythm, a chant that works on you whether you understand it or not. This song follows that same spirit—letting the groove and the syllables do the work.  
From the transformed city where seekers stop too soon, to Medicine King's ancient incantations, to the Daimoku that condenses everything into six syllables—this is the story of how sound becomes a bridge to what can't be spoken.  
No fancy theology required. Just open your ears, let it roll over you, and see where it takes you.  
*Recorded in the spirit of front porch wisdom and midnight revelations.*  
Inspired by teachings on dhāraṇī as non-conceptual upāya—the unspoken teaching that lives in vibration, not explanation.

Roots blues folk song, ~95 BPM. Acoustic guitar fingerpicked in open D or G tuning, upright bass walking, harmonica fills like train whistle + spirit call. Laid-back groove, living room session feel. Conversational, weathered male vocal, slightly raspy. Verses sparse (guitar + bass), choruses fuller with light drums + 2–3 harmony voices on “chant it” and “let that dharma fly.” Bridge strips to guitar + voice, slide guitar enters, searching tone. Outro solo voice + guitar, porch-at-dusk vibe, spoken/half-sung. Chant “Namu Myoho Renge Kyo” clear and natural, half-beat pause before it. Warm, woody mix, raw not polished.  
  
  
**Verse 1:**   
Well the Buddha woke up from his meditation deep   
Said "What I know, y'all, it's way too wide to keep   
In words and explanations, logic won't get through—   
This wisdom's like the ocean, deeper than the blue"  
  
**Chorus:**   
So I'm gonna chant it, not gonna think it through   
Just let that sound roll over, let it work on you   
Don't need to understand it, don't need to know why   
Just open up your mouth now, let that dharma fly  
  
**Verse 2:**   
Those old-time monks, they thought they had it made   
Reached a little peace and then they stopped and stayed   
But the Buddha said "Keep walking, that city ain't real—   
I got something bigger for you, if you can learn to feel"  
  
**Chorus:**   
So I'm gonna chant it, not gonna think it through   
Just let that sound roll over, let it work on you   
Don't need to understand it, don't need to know why   
Just open up your mouth now, let that dharma fly  
  
**Bridge:**   
Medicine-King stood up, said "I got something here—   
Ancient words of power that'll cast out fear   
Don't matter what they mean, just say 'em strong and true   
Body, speech, and mind unite—that's all you gotta do"  
  
**Verse 3:**   
*Namu Myoho Renge Kyo*—six syllables long   
The whole universe contained inside that song   
You can't think your way to heaven, but you sure can sing   
Let that sound become the bridge, become everything  
  
**Final Chorus:**   
So we're gonna chant it, ain't gonna think it through   
Let that sound roll over, let it work on you   
The unspoken teaching's in the sound you make   
Open up and holler—that's how you awake  
  
**Outro:**   
*(spoken/half-sung)*   
Yeah, the truth's too big for talking   
But it fits inside a song...
