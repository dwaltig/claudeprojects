# Beyond the Magic City  
  
Through skillful means the Guide unveils the way:  
Three seeming paths unwind the worldly maze.  
A Magic City shimmers, bright as day—  
A haven raised to calm the traveler’s daze.  
  
Yet this is not the treasure we pursue;  
It is Upāya’s grace, a brief reprieve,  
To gather strength before the journey’s true  
And single Vehicle that all achieve.  
  
For Buddha-nature pulses in each and every heart;  
The hidden jewel is present from the start.  
When every false distinction finds release,  
Universal Buddhahood awakens peace.
