[Intro]  
[Intro]  
  
(Verse 1)  
There was a king with a mighty throne,  
Fought for his kingdom, made it his own.  
But the war didn’t end, the battle raged on,  
Rival kings wanted what he won.  
  
(Chorus)  
He gave his soldiers all they could need,  
Horses, jewels, and victory’s seed.  
But the crown jewel, he kept in hand,  
For a king alone, to wear and command.  
  
(Verse 2)  
The king watched his men, so brave and true,  
Fighting hard, like they always knew.  
He gave ‘em towns, gave ‘em gold,  
But that crown jewel, he wouldn’t let go.  
  
(Chorus)  
He gave his soldiers all they could need,  
Horses, jewels, and victory’s seed.  
But the crown jewel, he kept in hand,  
For a king alone, to wear and command.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
(Bridge)  
One day he saw a spirit rise,  
Whose courage shone like a star in the sky.  
Moved by his strength, his fightin’ soul,  
He gave away that jewel, made him whole.  
  
(Verse 3)  
Now just like that king, the Buddha reigns,  
Over a world where suffering remains.  
He teaches us, to set us free,  
But holds one secret, just for thee.  
  
(Chorus)  
He gives his teachings, far and wide,  
Shows us the path where wisdom resides.  
But the crown jewel, he waits to share,  
For those who conquer, with love and care.  
  
(Verse 4)  
The warriors fight against the night,  
Greed and hate, they’re put to flight.  
And when they stand, with spirits pure,  
The Buddha’s jewel, they will secure.  
  
(Chorus)  
He gives his teachings, far and wide,  
Shows us the path where wisdom resides.  
But the crown jewel, he waits to share,  
For those who conquer, with love and care.  
  
(Outro)  
So take your stand, and fight the blues,  
With wisdom's light, you’ll never lose.  
The crown jewel waits, for those who dare,  
To love and fight with hearts laid bare.  
  
[End]  
[End]
