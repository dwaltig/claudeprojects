The world, a lotus pond, they say, Some buds lie buried, dark and deep, Some pierce the surface, greet the day, While others rise, from slumber leap, Unstained, above the water's way.  
  
So too, humanity, we find, In shadowed depths of mind reside, Or catch a glimmer, frail and blind, While few, with clarity as their guide, See past the self, the ego's shrine.  
  
The path to knowing, a steep ascent, Against the current's fierce embrace, Where yearnings pull, desire's intent, And tangled webs of self-efface, The quiet truth, the heart unbent.  
  
We grasp at comfort, worn and old, At fleeting joys, that soon will cease, In hardened paths, a story told, And deaf to wisdom's inner peace, By restless thought, our wills controlled.  
  
The fire of craving, fiercely burns, A blaze of senses, feeding need, For power's sway, for gain it yearns, Illusion's chase, the bitter seed, Where sorrow blooms, and pain returns.  
  
To see with vision, pure and clear, The mind, a mirror, still and bright, With feelings tempered, calmed of fear, And mindfulness, to guide our light, Shedding the masks, we hold so dear.  
  
Yet doubt remains, a chilling breath, It whispers fears, of paths untrod, Eroding faith, embracing death, To trust the journey, see the God, The knowing heart, truth's gentle thread.  
  
This path requires our deepest might, To question all, we hold so fast, To face the shadow, veiled in night, And nurture wisdom's tender cast, To find that peace, the soul's true light.
