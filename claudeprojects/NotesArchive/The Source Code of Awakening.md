# The Source Code of Awakening  
  
 I. Ancient Wisdom, Modern Light  
  
In an age of endless scroll and digital hum,    
Where quick-fix patches leave us still undone,    
Stands a teaching ancient yet forever young—    
The Lotus Sutra, whose song remains unsung    
By those who chase the fleeting and the new.    
Yet in its depths, a power ever true.    
  
Not just another wisdom app to download and delete,    
But the master key where all true seekers meet.    
  
 II. The Digital Dharma  
  
Like a phone that needs its core programming,    
Our spirits seek the right operating system.    
The Sutra's not just another mindful trend,    
But the source code where all illusions end.    
  
When notifications pull your focus thin,    
When algorithms dictate your thoughts within,    
The Sutra offers presence, deep and clear—    
A spiritual firmware, perfectly engineered.    
  
 III. Renewable Wisdom  
  
Other teachings drain like batteries depleted,    
Their temporary comfort soon defeated.    
But the Lotus blooms with solar-powered grace,    
Sustainable wisdom for the human race.    
  
In climate crisis, when the future dims,    
The Sutra teaches how each part belongs, each limb    
Of our vast connected body, Earth and sky—    
Teaching us to live, not merely to get by.    
  
 IV. The Network of Being  
  
While dial-up doctrines buffer, stall, and freeze,    
The Sutra connects with fiber-optic ease.    
A 5G wisdom bridging worlds apart,    
From daily struggle to enlightened heart.    
  
In loneliness, when screens replace our touch,    
When followers and friends don't mean so much,    
The Sutra reveals our interbeing state—    
We're never truly separate or isolate.    
  
 V. Digital Alchemy  
  
Like mugwort growing straight among the hemp,    
Like code rewritten with a master's intent,    
We transform through the company we keep.    
The Sutra's mastermind makes wisdom leap.    
  
It's not about downloading sacred text,    
But letting it rewrite what happens next.    
An algorithm of compassion's art,    
Debugging the delusions of the heart.    
  
 VI. The Ultimate Upgrade  
  
In this era of updates, constant change,    
The Lotus Sutra still remains in range.    
Not just an ancient scroll for scholars' eyes,    
But living code where our true nature lies.    
  
Don't settle for the patches, quick and small,    
When this great system offers you its all.    
The ultimate life hack for being whole—    
The open-source awakening of your soul.    
  
 VII. Timeless Innovation  
  
So hear these words across a thousand years,    
Still relevant amidst our modern fears.    
Nichiren's voice, translated for our time,    
In circuits, networks, power grids sublime.    
  
The Lotus Sutra—never obsolete,    
Where ancient wisdom makes our lives complete.    
A transformative force that never ends,    
As timeless as the truth it still defends.
