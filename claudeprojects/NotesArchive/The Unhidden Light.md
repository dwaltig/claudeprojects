# The Unhidden Light  
  
**"The Unhidden Light"** is a soulful acoustic **Folk-Blues** track inspired by the profound promise at the heart of the **Lotus Sūtra**: the Buddha's **universal vow** to lead every living being to the same enlightenment he attained.  
  
Set to a warm, rhythmic arrangement, this song serves as a powerful reminder that the ultimate truth is an **open secret**. The lyrics confront the isolating **"knowledge that separates"** and affirm the **wisdom that unites**, urging the listener to recognize the unhidden potential—the light of Buddhahood—that flows in everyone.  
  
This is a story of **compassion**, an intimate contemplation on the shared spiritual journey, and a joyful rejection of the idea that enlightenment is exclusive or distant. Let the music guide you from the loneliness of the "hungry wheel" to the peace of the "Lotus blooms."

## Lyrics  
  
**(Verse 1)**   
(A minor)   
A high, strong **vow** was spoken on the peak of truth,   
Not just for ages gone or some long-lost youth.   
It's written on the ledger of every livin' soul,   
A deep conviction pointing toward the ultimate goal.   
He said, "The very **light** I shine, my friend, that light is yours."   
No hidden chamber, no back way, no locked or bolted doors.  
  
**(Chorus)**   
(C major - G major - A minor)   
Oh, the Buddha holds **nothin' back** from you and me,   
No secret code, no special mystery.   
His **wisdom is a river**, his truth is plain to see,   
'Cause the potential that he found is flowin' in you and me.   
He said, "I'll cause all livin' beings to attain the very thing   
The **same enlightenment** that I am here to bring."  
  
**(Verse 2)**   
(A minor)   
You see the world's knowledge, it turns a hungry wheel,   
A cold, sharp blade of intellect designed to peel   
Our lives to pieces, markin' where we stop and where we start,   
Tearin' "me" from "you," keepin' our fearful selves apart.   
That’s the **knowledge that separates**, friend, that builds the lonely wall,   
Waitin' on the fear and judgment to make us rise or fall.  
  
**(Chorus)**   
(C major - G major - A minor)   
But the Buddha holds **nothin' back** from you and me,   
No secret code, no special mystery.   
His **wisdom is a river**, his truth is plain to see,   
'Cause the potential that he found is flowin' in you and me.   
He said, "I'll cause all livin' beings to attain the very thing   
The **same enlightenment** that I am here to bring."  
  
**(Bridge)**   
(F major - C major - G major - A minor)   
But look close, look deep, where the **Lotus blooms** in mud,   
There’s a wisdom that refuses to be bought with flesh and blood.   
It sees your face in mine, it sees the same spark burn,   
A unifying fire, where all our lessons turn.   
No threat to his great glory, no fear that we'll ascend,   
'Cause the light is for the many, and the journey has no end.  
  
**(Outro - Slowing Tempo)**   
(A minor fading out)   
Yeah, the same enlightenment...   
That which unites us, brother...   
The unhidden light...   
Flowin' in you and me...
