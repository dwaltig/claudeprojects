Based on the sources, the Buddha describes the Lotus Sutra in several significant ways:  
* The Buddha declares that the Lotus Sutra is the **chief of Sûtrântas**.  
* He states that the teachings of the Lotus of the True Law **exceed all other scriptures spoken by the Tathagata** (Buddha). It is likened to the vast ocean surpassing all springs, streams, and ponds, and to Sumeru, the king of mountains, towering over all hills and peaks. It is also compared to the moon being foremost among all stars.  
* The Buddha indicates that the Lotus of the True Law **stands above all other teachings**, even superior to the Bodhisattva compared to all disciples.  
* He calls it a **savior from all fears and pains**, a **refreshing tank for the thirsty, a warming fire for the cold, clothing for the naked, a guide for travelers, a mother’s care, a boat across troubled waters, a healer for the sick, a lamp in the darkness, a treasure for the needy, the ocean’s embrace for rivers, and a torch that scatters shadows**.  
* The Buddha refers to the Lotus Sutra as a **Dharma discourse called ‘the Lotus of the True Law’**.  
* He mentions that the Lotus Sutra is a teaching that can be trusted.

* The Buddha reveals that the enlightened ones employ **“countless expedient means, all kinds of causes and conditions, comparisons, metaphors, terminologies, in order to set forth the teachings for the sake of living beings – these teachings are all the One Journey to Enlightenment”**. The Lotus Sutra itself is considered a skillful means, revealing the truth progressively.

* He also says that the Lotus of Truth is the **father of all those good people who are still learning and those who are beyond learning and all those who aspire to be Bodhisattvas**.  
* The Buddha states that the **Treasury of the Teaching** can be faithfully upheld by those who can understand by direct experience the teaching he has set forth, referring to the Lotus Flower Sutra.
