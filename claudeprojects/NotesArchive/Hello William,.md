Subject: Response to Your Concerns About Building Three  
  
Dear [Owner's Name],  
  
I hope this message finds you well. I understand your concerns regarding the proximity of your unit in Building Three to the street, and the potential disturbances caused by passing trucks.  
  
It's not uncommon for vibrations from heavy traffic to be felt in units close to the street. However, I want to assure you that this is a typical urban living experience and doesn't necessarily indicate a problem with the building's structural integrity.  
  
Regarding the cracks in the walls that you mentioned, I agree that this issue can typically be resolved with plaster and paint.  
  
As for any potential structural issues, please know that the board is not currently aware of any such problems in Building Three. However, we are committed to the harmony and well-being of all our residents. Should any structural concerns arise, we will investigate them thoroughly and take the necessary steps to ensure the building's integrity.
