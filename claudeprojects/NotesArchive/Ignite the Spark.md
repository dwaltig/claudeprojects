Lyrics:   
[Intro]  
(Verse 1)  
Yo, peep the scene, it's a new generation  
Rainbow Garden risin', pure elevation  
Inner light gleamin', breakin' through the haze  
Ignitin' the power, settin' hearts ablaze  
Doubt tryin' to trap us, keep us in the shade  
But truth cuts through the darkness, unafraid  
We're all connected, a tapestry of souls  
Bound by greatness, reachin' for our goals  
  
(Chorus)  
The world's on fire, yeah,   
But we got the power  
Acceptance is the key, unlock the chains  
Build a future, wash away the stains  
United we stand, a force so strong  
Our potential's limitless, we can't go wrong  
Heal the planet, make it shine so bright  
Rainbow Garden bloomin', day and night  
  
(Verse 2)  
Grateful for this gift, a chance to rewrite  
The story of our lives, filled with love and light  
Use it wisely, create a masterpiece  
For all humanity, find inner peace  
No more hate, no more war, let compassion lead  
Plant the seeds of kindness, a world in need  
Let empathy blossom, let forgiveness reign  
Break the cycle, erase the pain  
  
(Chorus)  
The world's on fire, yeah,  
But we got the power  
Acceptance is the key, unlock the chains  
Build a future, wash away the stains  
United we stand, a force so strong  
Our potential's limitless, we can't go wrong  
Heal the planet, make it shine so bright  
Rainbow Garden bloomin', day and night  
  
(Bridge)  
Love and light, that's the only way  
Shine your colors, brighter every day  
From the roots to the sky, let the garden grow  
Rainbow revolution, let the whole world know  
  
(Chorus)  
The world's on fire, yeah,  
But we got the power  
Acceptance is the key, unlock the chains  
Build a future, wash away the stains  
United we stand, a force so strong  
Our potential's limitless, we can't go wrong  
Heal the planet, make it shine so bright  
Rainbow Garden bloomin', day and night  
  
(Outro)  
Spread the word, let the message fly  
Rainbow Garden touchin' the sky  
Yeah, we risin', breakin' free  
This is the future, for you and me  
Peace!  
  
[End]
