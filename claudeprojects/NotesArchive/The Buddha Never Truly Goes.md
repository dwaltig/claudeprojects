Lyrics:   
(Verse 1)  
They tell of Buddha’s final breath, and thought his work was through, A fading sun that left the earth, with nothing left to do. But the Master taught a deeper truth, to one who listened near, That worldly death was just a show, to conquer doubt and fear.  
  
(Chorus)  
'Cause the Buddha never truly goes, his home is everywhere, He's in the wind, a river's flow, a silent, humble prayer. So when your heart is dark with doubt, and you're lost upon the road, Just hear his voice, a silent sound, and lift that heavy load.  
  
(Verse 2)   
Some folks get too comfortable, when they think the truth is free, If the Master’s always standing by, then where's the urgency? So he plays a trick, a clever means, a lesson sharp and grand, To make us hungry for his presence, while he guides a waking land.  
  
(Chorus)   
'Cause the Buddha never truly goes, his home is everywhere, He's in the wind, a river's flow, a silent, humble prayer. So when your heart is dark with doubt, and you're lost upon the road, Just hear his voice, a silent sound, and lift that heavy load.  
  
(Bridge)   
Maitreya, with an open heart, a timeless truth you'll see, I’ve walked this long, long path with you, and my light has set you free. And all who hear this lesson's sound, and hold it to their core, Will be a light for all the world, and shine forevermore.  
  
(Guitar Solo - Melancholic but hopeful blues)  
  
(Verse 3)   
Don't need a temple, don't need a shrine, don't need to count the years Just need a moment's humble thought, to wash away the tears To know the guiding hand is there, no matter what it seems To walk this earth with open eyes, and live the truest dreams.  
  
(Outro)   
Yeah, the Buddha never truly goes... He's right here... in you and me... His light is always shining... can you see? Always... right here.
