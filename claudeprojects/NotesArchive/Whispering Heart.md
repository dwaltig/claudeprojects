Whispering Heart  
  
In the quiet, a soft, subtle call, A whisper of truth, I hear it all, Not a voice from the clouds, loud and strong, But an echo within, where I belong.  
  
It whispers in dreams, a language so bright, A knowing so deep, it cuts through the night, A song in the wind, a star in the sky, It speaks to my soul, telling me why.  
  
It clarifies paths, illuminates the way, With a gentle nudge, it shows me the day, A spark ignites, a passion takes hold, My purpose unfolds, as stories are told.  
  
It's a comfort, a solace, a feeling so true, A connection to something, ancient and new, A sense of belonging, a place in the whole, My spirit awakened, my heart takes control.
