Verse 1 In the stillness of dawn, I find my refuge deep Not on some mountain high, nor where the wild winds sweep But in this beating heart, where all the worlds reside Beyond the highest peak, it's here I safely hide  
  
Chorus Oh, the arrows may fly, darkness may bend and break But the just stand tall, for truth's own sake Foundations may crumble, the world may fall apart But the wise one walks on, with a steady, peaceful heart  
  
Verse 2 In every soul's chamber, there's an awakening light Shining through the sorrow, burning ever bright Not a light to run from, but one that opens wide Seeing through the illusions, casting fear aside  
  
Chorus Oh, the arrows may fly, darkness may bend and break But the just stand tall, for truth's own sake Foundations may crumble, the world may fall apart But the wise one walks on, with a steady, peaceful heart  
  
Bridge From the heavens above, Compassion's eyes do see Through the veil of sadness, our tears He wipes gently Not with judgment's weight, but with wisdom's warm embrace For each soul's a mirror, reflecting His holy face  
  
Verse 3 Those who play with fire, lost in storm and rage Build themselves a prison, trapped within their cage But mercy's wind will blow, tearing those bars away Even the cruelest heart can find a brighter day  
  
Chorus Oh, the arrows may fly, darkness may bend and break But the just stand tall, for truth's own sake Foundations may crumble, the world may fall apart But the wise one walks on, with a steady, peaceful heart  
  
Outro So find your refuge, not in flight, but in deep peace Where the heart's quiet song brings a sweet release For the Lord is awakened, in every soul He dwells And in every act of justice, His truth forever swells
