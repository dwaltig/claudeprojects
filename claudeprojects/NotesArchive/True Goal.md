# True Goal  
  
*True Goal* is a soulful blend of blues, folk, and country that takes listeners on a reflective journey of self-discovery. Inspired by Chapter 14 of the *Lotus Sutra*, the song explores themes of longing, disillusionment, and the realization that true fulfillment lies within. With evocative lyrics and a heartfelt melody, it paints a vivid picture of a lone traveler shedding preconceived notions, uncovering inner potential, and finding peace in the beauty of transformation.

Verse 1: The Illusion of the Goal    
I climbed the hills, I crossed the streams,    
Chasing after golden dreams.    
A crown of stars, a fleeting flame,    
But when I held it, it felt the same.    
  
Chorus: The Emptiness    
The crown I chased was made of air,    
A kingdom built on dreams that tear.    
I thought I’d find the truth so sweet,    
But all I found were empty streets.    
  
Verse 2: The Turn Inward    
The mirror cracked, the veil was torn,    
I saw the lies I’d built upon.    
Peeling back each hollow layer,    
A deeper truth began to flare.    
  
Bridge: The Hidden Treasure    
A light within I failed to see,    
A boundless truth inside of me.    
The universe, both vast and small,    
Reflected in the heart of all.    
  
Chorus (Refrain): True Power    
The crown I chased was never there,    
But now I breathe the open air.    
The truth I sought was always near,    
A treasure found when skies are clear.    
  
Outro: Peaceful Practices    
The path unfolds with every stride,    
No need to chase, no need to hide.    
The world’s vast beauty, now I see,    
The goal was just to let it be.
