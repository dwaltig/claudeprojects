# Medicine King’s Protection  
  
**Medicine King's Protection – A Midnight Bayou Mantra**  
Slide guitar hums, lantern light flickers, and ancient vows rise on the night air. *Medicine King's Protection* is a swampy, foot-stomping folk-blues built from the Lotus Sutra’s Chapter 26 dhāraṇī—protective spells spoken for the well-being of all who carry the teaching.  
  
Each verse weaves sacred syllables like **Anye manye, mane mamane** into a smoky back-porch groove, turning timeless mantras into living music. The chorus rolls like a river freight train, reminding us that courage and compassion can be sung as much as spoken.  
  
Whether you come for the raw slide guitar or the luminous spiritual roots, this track invites you to chant, sway, and feel the protective power of sound itself.  
  
Lyrics  
(mid-tempo, swampy folk-blues with a slow back-porch stomp)  
  
Verse 1  
Bhaishajya Rāja stepped up to say,  
“I’ve got words to keep the dark away.  
For every heart that holds the Sutra near,  
These sounds will scatter doubt and fear.”*  
Anye manye, mane mamane,  
Kitte karite, samitāvi—  
Old as the rivers, deep as the night,  
Shield you in love, wrap you in light.  
  
Chorus  
Oh, sing these names like a freight-train moan,  
Bone-deep magic, stronger than stone.  
Every grain of the Ganges sand  
Lifts a vow to guard this land.  
Yeah, chant it low, let the rhythm roll,  
These holy blues gonna save your soul.  
  
Verse 2  
Sānte, mukte, muktatame,  
Same avishame, samasame—  
From gaye to kshaye, fears unwind,  
Akshine, sānte sanī, peace you’ll find.  
Dhārani ālokabhāshe, light the way,  
Pratyavekshani, nidhini, hold the sway.  
Abhyantaravisishte, break those chains,  
Asade, parade—freedom remains.  
  
Chorus  
Oh, sing these names like a freight-train moan,  
Bone-deep magic, stronger than stone.  
Every grain of the Ganges sand  
Lifts a vow to guard this land.  
Yeah, chant it low, let the rhythm roll,  
These holy blues gonna save your soul.  
  
Bridge (call & response, gospel feel)  
Sukānkshī! (Peace inside!)  
Asamasame! (No divide!)  
Buddhavilokite! (See the truth!)  
Dharmaparikshite! (Proof on proof!)  
  
Sanghanirghoshani—find your voice,  
Bhayābhayasodhanī—make courage your choice.  
Mantre mantrākshayate, rutakausalye,  
Unbreakable spirit, come what may.  
  
Final Verse / Outro  
Akshaye, akshavanataāya, strong,  
Vakule valoda, steady and long.  
Amanyatāya—stand up tall,  
These Buddha-born words protect us all.  
  
Chorus  
Oh, sing these names like a freight-train moan,  
Bone-deep magic, stronger than stone.  
Every grain of the Ganges sand  
Lifts a vow to guard this land.  
Yeah, chant it low, let the rhythm roll,  
These holy blues gonna save your soul.
