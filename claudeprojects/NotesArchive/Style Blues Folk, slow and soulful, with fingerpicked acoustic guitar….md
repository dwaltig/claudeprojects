**Style: Blues Folk, slow and soulful, with fingerpicked acoustic guitar, upright bass, soft brush drums, and occasional harmonica fills. Warm, intimate male vocal, slightly raspy, like a storyteller around a campfire. Natural reverb to create an earthy, close atmosphere.**  
  
**Mood: Reflective, tender, and quietly hopeful. Deep but not heavy. Emphasize a sense of wonder in the ordinary and the hidden beauty in hardship.**  
  
**Lyrics: (full lyrics below)**  
  
**I struck two stones in the midnight cold,**  
**No light ’round me, no hand to hold.**  
**But a spark leapt free from the heavy gloom—**  
**Whispered soft, “Child, there’s fire in the tomb.”**  
  
**I passed a tree that winter forgot,**  
**Barren and brittle, life seemed lost.**  
**But come the spring, it bloomed so wide—**  
**“Child,” it sang, “there’s a blossom inside.”**  
  
**[Chorus]**  
**Oh, fire in the stone, bloom in the wood,**  
**Buddha in the tears, in the blood, in the mud.**  
**Hard to believe, harder to see,**  
**But the Buddha walks quiet, deep in you and me.**  
  
**[Bridge]**  
**Like water in fire, or a flame in the sea,**  
**This Dharma hides softly, where hurt used to be.**  
  
**[Chorus repeat]**  
**Yeah, fire in the stone, bloom in the wood,**  
**Buddha in the cry, in the dark misunderstood.**  
**Hard to believe, but it’s true as can be,**  
**The Buddha walks gentle, deep in you and me.**
