# Gotta keep on climbin', gotta reach for the sky  
  
This soulful blues track explores the inner turmoil of a Bodhisattva battling temptation and the weight of past actions, inspired by verses 26 and 27 of Chapter 4 in the Bodhicaryāvatāra. A raw and introspective journey through the darkness, seeking redemption and the path to enlightenment.

Lyrics:   
(Verse 1)  
Woke up this mornin', sun shinin' in my face  
Felt a little somethin', like I was in the right place  
This human life, a gift, a chance to set things right  
But the devil's on my shoulder, whisperin' day and night  
  
(Verse 2)  
Got this precious body, got this mind so keen  
But the fire down below, that's where I've always bean  
If I fall back in that pit, with all this wisdom gained  
Lord, it'd be a shame, all this livin' in vain  
  
(Chorus)  
Feels like a curse, some kinda wicked spell  
Got my head all cloudy, can't think straight, can't tell  
What's got a hold of me, draggin' me down low  
This ain't the path I wanna walk, this ain't the way to go  
  
(Verse 3)  
Remember that feelin', the burnin' and the pain  
Ain't no way I'm goin' back, to wear those chains again  
Gotta fight this darkness, gotta keep my spirit strong  
Gotta hold on tight, gotta right this weary wrong  
  
(Chorus)  
Feels like a curse, some kinda wicked spell  
Got my head all cloudy, can't think straight, can't tell  
What's got a hold of me, draggin' me down low  
This ain't the path I wanna walk, this ain't the way to go  
  
(Bridge)  
Lord, give me strength, give me guidance along the way  
Help me find the light, chase these shadows away  
This human life, a chance, a gift I can't deny  
  
(Guitar solo)  
  
(Outro)  
Yeah, gotta keep on climbin', gotta reach for the sky  
Leave that darkness behind, gotta learn to fly  
  
(Chorus)  
Feels like a curse, some kinda wicked spell  
Got my head all cloudy, can't think straight, can't tell  
What's got a hold of me, draggin' me down low  
This ain't the path I wanna walk, this ain't the way to go  
  
(Bridge)  
Lord, give me strength, give me guidance along the way  
Help me find the light, chase these shadows away  
  
(Fade out with slide guitar)
