Lyrics:  
[Verse]   
Grateful, livin' in this broken shell Roots of my spirit reach far and wide A thousand lives paved my road so well Underneath them stars, I ride  
  
[Verse 2] Offerings to thrones long gone Dharma sings in whispers low Etched in flesh, these lessons drawn Faith rises where shadows grow  
  
[Chorus] I've been born a thousand times Wandered lost, walkin' slowly Destiny has pulled me through I'm reborn, faith ain't lonely  
  
[Verse 3] Sutras whisper in the dark They can slander, but can't erase Every step that leaves a mark Light echoes through this sacred place  
  
[Bridge] Karma's thread loops 'round and 'round Soul reborn from nights of mourn Weaving somethin' holy now Gratitude come every dawn  
  
[Chorus] I've been born a thousand times Wandered lost, walkin' slowly Destiny has pulled me through I'm reborn, faith ain't lonely
