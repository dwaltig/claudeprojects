My Impact on others  
  
In the realm of words, my book found its place,  
A tapestry of wisdom, a reflection of grace.  
With every verse, a connection unfurled,  
Touching the lives of those who came to my world.  
  
Through the pages, my thoughts reached afar,  
Elevating spirits, like a guiding star.  
In the hearts of readers, my words found a home,  
Igniting a fire, where inspiration would roam.  
  
For in the tapestry of life, we intertwine,  
Through the power of art, a connection divine.  
Like a gentle breeze, my words touched their souls,  
Creating ripples of change, making them whole.  
  
But as I reflect upon my journey's trail,  
I recall moments when others made me prevail.  
A poet's words, a painter's brushstroke,  
Their art reached within, my spirit awoke.  
  
A verse that resonated, like a symphony's song,  
An artist's creation, where emotions belong.  
Their words, their art, stirred a fire deep within,  
Igniting my soul, reminding me to begin.  
  
In those profound moments, I felt understood,  
An affirmation that my path was good.  
The power of art, a bridge to unite,  
Connecting souls, like stars in the night.  
  
And amidst my journey, I came to see,  
The profound impact I could have, just like they.  
A chance encounter, a lending hand,  
A single act of kindness, a life gently fanned.  
  
In the eyes of another, I saw hope arise,  
A spark of inspiration, reflected in their eyes.  
To touch a life, to make a positive mark,  
Is a gift we possess, both humble and stark.  
  
For art and connection, they hold a great might,  
Illuminating paths, guiding us through the night.  
In the tapestry of existence, we're woven as one,  
Bound by the power of love, till our journey is done.  
  
So, I'll continue to write, to create and inspire,  
Knowing my words can uplift and inspire.  
For the impact we make, big or small,  
Has the potential to resonate, to touch one and all.  
  
In the symphony of life, let our voices unite,  
As we share our art, our wisdom, our light.  
For it's through these connections, our spirits align,  
Creating a world where love and beauty shine.
