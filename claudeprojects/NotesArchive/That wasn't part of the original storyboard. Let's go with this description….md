Lyrics:  
“Woke up with the sunrise on my face…”  
  
Visual:  
	•	A person wakes up and opens the curtain to golden light.  
	•	Close-up: Face softened by morning light, breath in.  
	•	Scenes of everyday kindness:  
	•	A young person helping an elder with groceries  
	•	A parent tying a child’s shoe  
	•	A man picking a flower from the sidewalk and tucking it behind his ear
