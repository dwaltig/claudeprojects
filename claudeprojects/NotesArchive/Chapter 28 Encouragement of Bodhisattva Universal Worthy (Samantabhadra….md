#   Chapter 28: Encouragement of Bodhisattva Universal Worthy (Samantabhadra) -   
## The final promise an protection:  
```

  - Samantabhadra arrives from the east with countless Bodhisattvas, creating earthquakes, raining
  jeweled flowers, cosmic music
  - He asks: "How can beings after the Buddha's death attain this sutra?"
  - The Four Requirements: Receive Buddha-protection, plant virtue-roots, enter the determined
  assembly, develop the resolve to save all beings
  - Samantabhadra's Protection: In the final dharma age, "I will ride a white six-tusked elephant and
  appear when you practice this sutra. If you forget one verse, I will teach it to you. I will give
  you dharani."
  - The Three-Week Commitment: Those who practice for 21 days with dedication will see Samantabhadra
  and receive empowerment
  - The Blessings:
    - Even writing the sutra = reborn in Maitreya's realm (Tushita heaven) with 84,000 celestial women
   welcoming you
    - Those who keep and practice = 1,000 Buddhas hold your hand at death, preventing fear and bad
  rebirths
    - You'll be born in Maitreya's presence
  - Cosmic Warnings: Mock a sutra-keeper and you go blind; expose their faults and get white leprosy;
  laugh at them and your teeth rot, your lips ugly, your body twisted. But honor them and gain
  immediate merit
  - The Final Vision: "When you see a sutra-keeper, know they will soon sit on the Bodhi tree, defeat
  all demons, attain enlightenment, turn the dharma wheel, blow the dharma conch, sound the dharma
  drum, and rain dharma upon all beings"
  - The Closing: Countless Bodhisattvas gain dharani. Everyone rejoices and departs in joy
  - The sutra ends: "The whole universe celebrates. Everyone leaves with great joy, keeping the
  Buddha's words."

  This is the TRIUMPHANT CLOSE - the cosmic affirmation that you will awaken. Let me translate it:
