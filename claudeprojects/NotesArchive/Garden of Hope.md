Lyrics:   
**[Verse 1]**  
Morning light, so bright (mmm, yeah)  
Petals dreaming, taking flight  
Hope is rising, hearts ignite  
In the flow, we feel the light  
  
**[Chorus]**  
Let it grow, let it play  
Strength and love, here to stay  
Endless glow, every day  
In the garden, we’ll sway, hey  
  
**[Verse 2]**  
Softly now, watch it soar  
Stem to sky, reaching more  
Hope and light, we adore  
Life’s dance, right to the core  
  
**[Bridge]**  
Bloom and shine, let it flow  
Rise and grow, let it show  
Endless love, feel the glow  
In the garden, we know
