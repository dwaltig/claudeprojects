# Three kinds of enemies  
  
I believe ignorant laypeople today are those who claim to be Buddhists but who do not actually know for themselves the teachings of the Buddha as taught in the sutras and who base their understanding on the views and opinions of their leaders, who themselves may not have a deep understanding of the teachings of the Buddha but who present their own ideas as Buddhism. These people then close their minds to any who try to point out what the sutras actually teach and instead cling to what they have read in secondary sources or to teachings given by whatever charismatic leader they have chosen to follow.
