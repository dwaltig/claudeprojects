# Why I Feel So Fortunate  
## *(A Dharma Blues)*  
  
I walked through dust and fire, thinkin’ I was alone, Chasin’ ghosts of meaning, far from any home. But the wind whispered softly, “Child, you already know— The seed you’ve been searchin’ for is the one you sow.”  
  
Now the stars seem closer, the pain feels kind, Each scar’s a sutra line the Buddha signed. I ain’t lucky, Lord—just awake enough to see, The whole wide Dharma’s been singin’ through me.  
  
So I thank the storm, the loss, the climb— They carved the truth in rhythm and time. I feel so fortunate, not ‘cause I won the fight, But ‘cause I see the dark’s just another kind of light.
