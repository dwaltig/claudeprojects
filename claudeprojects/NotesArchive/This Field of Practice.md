**Lyrics**  
[Verse 1]  
In the marketplace of countless souls,  
Where the hustle moves and the bell tolls,  
Ancient wisdom flows unseen,  
Through common acts and quiet dreams.  
Each trade and step, a sacred start,  
A thread of Dharma in the heart.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, see the light in every face,  
Find the truth in this humble place.  
No need to seek on distant shore,  
The sacred lies at your own door.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Not in peaks where clouds embrace,  
Or temples made of gilded grace,  
But here, where coins and laughter ring,  
The lotus blooms in everything.  
The dust of life becomes a shrine,  
Where earth and heaven intertwine.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, see the light in every face,  
Find the truth in this humble place.  
No need to seek on distant shore,  
The sacred lies at your own door.  
  
[Bridge]  
Through hands that give, through debts we pay,  
Through work that fills another’s day,  
Each honest act, each gentle care,  
Becomes a prayer, becomes a prayer.  
  
[Verse 3]  
To guide, to earn, to share, to grow,  
In fleeting days, the seeds we sow.  
The shifting ways of life unfold,  
A field of grace in dust and gold.  
Where strangers meet, the path begins,  
The heart takes flight, the spirit sings.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, see the light in every face,  
Find the truth in this humble place.  
No need to seek on distant shore,  
The sacred lies at your own door.  
  
[Outro]  
So take this world of gain and loss,  
Its dreams and dust, its golden dross,  
For in this field of common things,  
The heart finds wings, the spirit sings.
