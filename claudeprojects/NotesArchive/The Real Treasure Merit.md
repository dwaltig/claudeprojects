# The Real Treasure: Merit  
  
(Verse 1)  
Yo, let me drop this knowledge, truth ancient and bold,  
'Bout a concept called merit, a story to be told.  
It ain't about the riches, or the bling that you hold,  
It's 'bout the goodness in your spirit, more precious than gold.  
  
(Chorus)  
Merit, yeah, it's the echo, the vibe that you send,  
A timeless wisdom, on which you can depend.  
It ain't selfish ambition, or a personal quest,  
It's the path of compassion, putting others to the test.  
  
(Verse 2)  
Imagine voices, a chain goin' strong,  
Each one passin' it on, where does the merit belong?  
The last in the line, yeah, they feelin' the grace,  
But the first one who shared it, set the pace.  
  
(Chorus)  
Merit, yeah, it's the echo, the vibe that you send,  
A timeless wisdom, on which you can depend.  
It ain't selfish ambition, or a personal quest,  
It's the path of compassion, putting others to the test.  
  
(Bridge)  
It ain't just words, it's a life you gotta live,  
With a heart full of joy, and a spirit that gives.  
Guiding others with skill, through the darkest of nights,  
Shining your light, doing what's right.  
  
(Chorus)  
Merit, yeah, it's the echo, the vibe that you send,  
A timeless wisdom, on which you can depend.  
It ain't selfish ambition, or a personal quest,  
It's the path of compassion, putting others to the test.  
  
(Outro)  
So let the goodness flow, let the truth be known,  
Merit's the real treasure, the seed that we've sown.
