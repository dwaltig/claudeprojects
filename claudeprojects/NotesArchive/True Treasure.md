**[Verse 1]** Yo, the richest life ain’t measured in gold, It’s in the stories lived, the hearts you hold. Not in the towers, not in the fame, But in the love you give, the light you claim. Moments so soft, they hit you deep, Kindness in your soul, that’s the treasure you keep. Wisdom in your veins, yeah, you see it clear, Life’s a canvas, paint it with love, no fear.  
  
**[Chorus]** True treasure’s not the cash, not the bling, It’s the joy you bring, the songs you sing. It’s the wisdom you drop, the love you show, Leave the world brighter, let your legacy glow. True treasure’s in the heart, in the soul’s fire, Lift it higher, lift it higher.  
  
**[Verse 2]** What’s the point of stacks if you’re empty inside? A ship with no compass, no place to abide. Life’s a gift, don’t waste it on greed, Plant the seeds of love, that’s all you need. Laugh with your people, feel the sun on your face, Help a stranger out, make the world a better place. Compassion’s the key, wisdom’s the door, Live deep, give more, that’s what life’s for.  
  
**[Chorus]** True treasure’s not the cash, not the bling, It’s the joy you bring, the songs you sing. It’s the wisdom you drop, the love you show, Leave the world brighter, let your legacy glow. True treasure’s in the heart, in the soul’s fire, Lift it higher, lift it higher.  
  
**[Bridge]** Gold fades, but love remains, In the echoes of your name, in the hearts you change. A flame that burns, a song that’s true, A life well-lived, that’s the real breakthrough. So shine your light, let it guide the way, Make it count, don’t let it slip away.  
  
**[Chorus]** True treasure’s not the cash, not the bling, It’s the joy you bring, the songs you sing. It’s the wisdom you drop, the love you show, Leave the world brighter, let your legacy glow. True treasure’s in the heart, in the soul’s fire, Lift it higher, lift it higher.  
  
**[Outro]** So live with heart, and love with grace, Leave the world a brighter place. True treasure’s not in what you own, It’s in the seeds of love you’ve sown. [Mic drop.]
