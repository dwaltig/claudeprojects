# The Soul-Sweeper’s Revelation  
(mid-tempo swamp-blues, 12/8 shuffle or slow 4 feel)  
  
Verse 1  
  
Woke up early to a clear-eyed sun,  
Heart at ease, the old fights done.  
Doubt and fear lost all their bite,  
House swept clean in the soft dawn light.  
  
Chorus  
  
Satisfied—yeah—by the battles I’d won,  
Calm as noon with the hard storms gone.  
Thought I’d touched the mountain’s final flame,  
But I banked the fire, dimmed the flame.  
  
Verse 2  
  
Walked that road of inward grind,  
Believed still waters were all I’d find.  
Contentment wrapped me snug and tight,  
Safe from the restless howl of night.  
  
Bridge  
  
Then a whisper slid through the cypress trees,  
A long-lost calling riding the breeze.  
Showed me the summit was only a door,  
And a wild blue shoreline asked for more.  
  
(optional guitar fill / harmonica break)  
  
Final Chorus / Outro  
  
Satisfied—yeah—but the climb runs on,  
Sky keeps opening, night to dawn.  
There’s a deeper trail and a brighter shore,  
A soul-sweeper’s work goes evermore.
