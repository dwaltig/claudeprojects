Verse 1:   
Walking down this dusty road,   
Every step reveals a sign,   
But there's more to this old world,   
Than what meets my eyes.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, I'm learnin' to see with these new eyes,  
Oh, I'm learnin' to see with these new eyes,  
Oh, I'm learnin' to see with these new eyes,  
Finding truth in cloudy skies.  
Oh, I'm learnin’ to see with these new eyes,  
Oh, I'm learnin’ to see with these new eyes,  
Oh, I'm learnin’ to see with these new eyes,  
This world's a blessing in disguise.  
  
Verse 2:  
People rush on by all day,  
Never stopping, never slow.  
But if we'd just take a moment,  
There's so much more we could know.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, I'm learnin’ to see with these new eyes,  
Oh, I'm learnin’ to see with these new eyes,  
Oh, I'm learnin’ to see with these new eyes,  
Finding truth in cloudy skies.  
Oh, I'm learnin’ to see with these new eyes,  
Oh, I'm learnin’ to see with these new eyes,  
Oh, I'm learnin’ to see with these new eyes,  
This world's a blessing in disguise.  
  
Bridge:  
It ain't easy, changing how we see,  
Takes time and patience, that's the key.  
But every day's a brand new start,  
To open up our mind and heart.  
  
Verse 3:  
This old world can be so hard,  
Full of trouble, full of pain.  
But with these new eyes I'm seeing,  
Every loss can be a gain.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, I'm learnin’ to see with these new eyes,  
Oh, I'm learnin’ to see with these new eyes,  
Oh, I'm learnin’ to see with these new eyes,  
Finding truth in cloudy skies.  
Oh, I'm learnin’ to see with these new eyes,  
Oh, I'm learnin’ to see with these new eyes,  
Oh, I'm learnin’ to see with these new eyes,  
This world's a blessing in disguise.  
  
Outro:  
Yeah, I'm learnin’ to see with these new eyes,  
Yeah, I'm learnin’ to see with these new eyes,  
Yeah, I'm learnin’ to see with these new eyes,  
This world's a blessing in disguise.
