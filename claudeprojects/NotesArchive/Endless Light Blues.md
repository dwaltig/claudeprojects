**Verse 1:** In a time beyond all counting, before the earth was formed, The Buddha found enlightenment, in a world that’s never born. He spoke of ancient wisdom, of a life that never ends, But to guide us on our journey, he used the truth that bends.

**Chorus:** Oh, the Buddha’s life is endless, beyond what we can see, He appears and then he vanishes, to set our spirits free. He’s the doctor with the medicine, we didn’t know we’d need, And in the silence of his absence, we learn how to believe.

**Verse 2:** He spoke in words that suited, the ones who couldn’t see, That his light had shone forever, through all eternity. He showed a world of dust and time, where countless eons pass, To teach us all the preciousness, of moments that won’t last.

**Bridge:** He’s not gone, though he’s hidden, in the shadows of our mind, Waiting for us to awaken, to the truth he left behind. The world keeps turning, but his light is never dim, In the quiet of our longing, we find our way to him.

**Verse 3:** So when you feel the emptiness, and think you’ve lost your way, Remember that he’s with you, though it seems he’s far away. The Buddha never leaves us, his truth is all around, In the echoes of our searching, that’s where he’ll be found.
