## The Bodhisattva's Mirror - Song Lyrics  
  
"The Bodhisattva's Mirror" is a contemplative and gently melancholic folk song, infused with subtle blues influences. Inspired by Buddhist philosophy, the song explores the idea that enlightenment and compassion reside within all beings, and that every encounter offers an opportunity for transformation. The lyrics paint a picture of a Bodhisattva – an enlightened being dedicated to helping others – who appears in countless forms, reflecting back our own potential for awakening.  
  
Musically, the song features fingerpicked acoustic guitar as its foundation, with a steady, grounding rhythm. Harmonica fills add a touch of bluesy texture, particularly during the chorus. The vocal delivery is intimate and weathered, conveying a sense of wisdom and quiet hope. The song builds dynamically from a sparse, introspective opening to a more powerful and emotionally resonant chorus, before returning to a peaceful, fading outro. It's a song about recognizing the sacredness in everyday life, and the interconnectedness of all things. It's a call to awaken to love and compassion, and to see the Buddha-nature within ourselves and others.

**(Verse 1 - Folk Style - Simple Chords, steady rhythm)** In this world of mist and pain, Where joy and sorrow fall like rain, A gentle spirit walks unseen, Reflectin' back what might have been. A Bodhisattva, soft and low, Watchin' seeds of kindness grow.  
  
**(Chorus - Slightly more Bluesy - a little more vocal power, maybe a harmonica fill)** Oh, the mirror shines, it shows us true, Buddha-nature waitin' in me and you. Lookin' for a light to break the chain, Love is here, again and again.  
  
**(Verse 2 - Folk Style - slightly more rhythmic)** Like moonlight dancin' on the lake, Or petals fallin' for goodness sake, This spirit changes, takes a guise, A teacher's wisdom in their eyes. A child's sweet face, a stranger's hand, Help is offered across the land.  
  
**(Chorus - Slightly more Bluesy - a little more vocal power, maybe a harmonica fill)** Oh, the mirror shines, it shows us true, Buddha-nature waitin' in me and you. Lookin' for a light to break the chain, Love is here, again and again.  
  
**(Verse 3 - Blues influenced - a little more space in the rhythm, slightly more vocal inflection)** Greed can rust the heart within, But compassion lets the healing begin. A cool breeze whisperin' in the soul, Makin' broken spirits whole. Walk with care on this weary ground, Every breath a sacred sound.  
  
**(Verse 4 - Folk Style - building slightly in intensity)** From mountain high to ocean deep, While we're wakin' and while we sleep, A song is callin', soft and clear, "Awaken, love is always here!" In every face, a mystery, A chance for transformation, you see.  
  
**(Chorus - Strongest yet - full vocal, harmonica prominent)** Oh, the mirror shines, it shows us true, Buddha-nature waitin' in me and you. Lookin' for a light to break the chain, Love is here, again and again.  
  
**(Bridge - Bluesy - slower, more introspective - maybe a simple guitar solo)** Who can say which form we'll find, To leave the troubled world behind? Each one a teacher, hid from view, Waitin' for a heart that's open and new.  
  
**(Outro - Folk Style - fades out slowly - fingerpicked guitar)** So open your eyes, and look around, Love is here, on sacred ground. Love is here... Love is here... **(Instrumental fade)**
