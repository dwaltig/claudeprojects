## “Medicine of the Vow”  
*Inspired by Chapter 13 and Hendoku Iyaku*  
  
They throw ash and call it rain,  
spit lies with scientific tongues.  
But I hold a mirror made of vows—  
it does not crack. It sings.  
  
The poison’s bitter, yes—  
but I drink it with the Bodhisattvas.  
In this cup, a secret:  
Pain, transformed, becomes prayer.  
  
I chant not to escape,  
but to illumine.  
Even this age,  
yes—*especially* this age,  
is holy ground.
