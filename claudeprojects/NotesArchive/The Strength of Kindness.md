# The Strength of Kindness  
  
Verse 1:  
The strength of kindness builds my home;   
forbearance clothes me tight,  
In abstraction's peaceful arms,   
I find the truth and light.  
When faced with clods, with sticks, or threats,   
remember me and stand,  
My spirit stretches far and wide,   
a guide through every land.  
  
Chorus:  
In whispers of the mountain air,   
in the echoes of the deep,  
My teachings flow through all who dare   
their sacred oath to keep.  
To the brave who walks this path with me,   
even when I'm gone,  
My creations come,   
a sight to see,   
ensuring he's never alone.  
  
To the brave who walks this path with me,   
even when I'm gone,  
My creations come, a sight to see,   
ensuring he's never alone.  
  
Verse 2:  
To the brave who shares this Sūtra's words,   
after I depart,  
My myriad forms in honor surge,   
to fortify his heart.  
Though taunts may fly and threats may rise,   
my guardians take a stand,  
Alone in study 'neath foreign skies,   
in mountains grand or wild lands.  
  
Chorus:  
In whispers of the mountain air,   
in the echoes of the deep,  
My teachings flow through all who dare   
their sacred oath to keep.  
To the brave who walks this path with me,   
even when I'm gone,  
My creations come,   
a sight to see,   
ensuring he's never alone.  
  
To the brave who walks this path with me,   
even when I'm gone,  
My creations come,   
a sight to see,   
ensuring he's never alone.

Bridge:  
I'll show my face in shimmering light,   
remind him of the vows forgot,  
In solitude's embrace or wild night,   
my presence fills his every thought.  
Gods and goblins, friends unseen,   
sent to keep him company,  
Such blessings flow, serene, unseen,   
whether preaching or in solitary.  
  
Chorus:  
In whispers of the mountain air,   
in the echoes of the deep,  
My teachings flow through all who dare   
their sacred oath to keep.  
To the brave who walks this path with me,   
even when I'm gone,  
My creations come,   
a sight to see,   
ensuring he's never alone.
