[Verse 1: Hardship of Suffering]  
Oh, I been walking this long, hard road,  
Carrying this pain, don’t know where to go.  
Birth and death just roll on by,  
Sufferin' in silence, no need to ask why.  
  
[Chorus]  
Gotta let it go, yeah, let it slide,  
Everything we hold, it'll fade in time.  
Three hardships, baby, gonna make you see,  
That the road to freedom, starts deep in me.  
  
[Verse 2: Hardship of Misconception]  
Thought I had it all, thought I'd found the light,  
But the truth kept slippin' just outta sight.  
I thought I was free, yeah, I thought I was wise,  
But the deeper truth was hiding in disguise.  
  
[Chorus]  
Gotta let it go, yeah, let it slide,  
Everything we hold, it'll fade in time.  
Three hardships, baby, gonna make you see,  
That the road to freedom, starts deep in me.  
  
[Bridge] (Slow it down, just voice and bass)  
Everything changes, nothin' stays the same,  
We're chasing shadows in a losin' game.  
But if you let it be, stop holding so tight,  
You'll find the freedom, in the darkest night.  
  
[Verse 3: Hardship of Endless Change]  
The world keeps movin’, never stays the same,  
Caught in the motion, don’t know who to blame.  
Let go of the past, let go of control,  
Findin’ peace in the flow, that’s how you grow old.  
  
[Chorus]  
Gotta let it go, yeah, let it slide,  
Everything we hold, it'll fade in time.  
Three hardships, baby, gonna make you see,  
That the road to freedom, starts deep in me.  
  
[Outro] (Fade out with guitar riff and slow harmonica)  
Oh, the road to freedom, it starts deep in me,  
Yeah, the road to freedom, starts deep in me…
