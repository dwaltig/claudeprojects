Lyrics:   
(Verse 1)  
He knelt before his enemy's feet,  
A broken king,   
his spirit weak,  
"Have mercy,"   
was his mournful plea,  
"See your own father,   
old and meek."  
  
(Verse 2)  
The warrior,   
hardened by the fight,  
Felt a strange   
stirring in his soul,  
A memory flickered,   
warm and bright,  
Of a love that made   
him whole.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, the love that conquers all,  
A love that mends a shattered soul,  
It rises above the hate and fear,  
And dries the bitter, burning tear.  
  
(Verse 3)  
The father's anguish,   
deep and raw,  
Mirrored in his enemy's eyes,  
Broke down the walls,   
defied the law,  
Of vengeance that never dies.  
  
(Verse 4)  
In that moment,   
shared despair,  
A bond was forged,   
a silent vow,  
To let compassion take the air,  
And gently lift them,   
here and now.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, the love that conquers all,  
A love that mends a shattered soul,  
It rises above the hate and fear,  
And dries the bitter, burning tear.  
  
(Bridge)  
Though worlds apart,   
their grief entwined,  
A father's love,   
a son's lament,  
In understanding,   
they could find,  
A solace that the gods had sent.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, the love that conquers all,  
A love that mends a shattered soul,  
It rises above the hate and fear,  
And dries the bitter, burning tear.  
  
(Outro)  
And in the silence,   
soft and deep,  
A promise whispered,   
hearts aligned,  
That love would conquer,   
secrets keep,  
And leave the pain behind.
