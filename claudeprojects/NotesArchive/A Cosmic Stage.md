# A Cosmic Stage  
  
From silence, a cosmic stage unfurled,   
Where **Dharma's ultimate truth** would transcend the world.   
No mere tale, but a **performative argument** grand,   
For the Lotus Sūtra, across every land.  
  
From earth's deep slumber, the **Jeweled Stupa** arose,  
Adorned with **"seven treasures**," its magnificence shows.  
Not a tomb of absence, but a **living presence** clear,  
Its **incomparable value** banishes fear.  
  
Suspended in air, yet born from the earth's deep core,  
It signals **truth within *sahā***, forevermore.  
Its **transcendent nature** above all mundane strife,  
Embracing both liberation and the practice of life.  
**Five hundred *yojanas*** high, freeing from rebirth's binds,  
**Two hundred fifty** wide, embodying precepts for minds.  
  
**Buddha-nature's ***metaphor*, inherently residing.,  
Within all sentient beings, patiently abiding.  
To see it, not with eyes, but with a **mind profound**,  
Touching one's **"original nature**,**"** where truth is found.  
  
Then, a **great voice** from within the tower spoke,  
Praising Śākyamuni's teaching, a solemn yoke.  
He is **Prabhūtaratna (Many Treasures)**, ancient and vast,  
From a distant world, a vow fulfilling fast.  
To **validate the Lotus Sūtra**, "Excellent!" he'd acclaim,  
Proving it an **eternal, timeless truth**, not a fleeting flame.  
He symbolizes **ultimate, ahistorical Dharma**, grand and wide,  
A constant truth across cosmic eons, a universal tide.  
  
Part II  
  
Śākyamuni then summoned his **"division body" Buddhas** vast,  
Gathered from countless worlds, from first to last.  
The world purified, **boundaries dissolved**, realms became one,  
A **single, unified Pure Land**, beneath the sun.  
This **One Vehicle** (*Ekayāna*), a visible decree,  
All provisional paths converge to Buddhahood, for all to see.  
  
The Stupa's door opened, **Prabhūtaratna** there sat,  
A **living presence**, dispelling all doubt and chat.  
He offered **half his seat** to Śākyamuni's form,  
**Two Buddhas, side-by-side** (*Nibutsu Byōza*), weathering the storm.  
A **perfect union** of **absolute and phenomenal** grace,  
**Non-duality's** testimony, in this sacred space.  
This moment, a **prelude to the Buddha's eternal lifespan** revealed,  
The Lotus Sūtra's **absolute truth**, now sealed.  
  
Yet, with such grandeur, a paradox arose,  
**"This Sūtra is hard to uphold**,**"** as the Buddha shows.  
The **six difficult acts**, profound and inner-bound,  
Outweigh **nine easy feats**, though cosmic and unsound.  
More arduous than throwing Sumeru, or grasping the void,  
Is faith in this teaching, its meaning employed.  
For transforming the heart, challenging deep-seated beliefs,  
Is a greater miracle than reordering cosmic reliefs.  
  
Its **difficulty stems from truth** it reveals,  
A **radical inclusivity**, the One Vehicle appeals.  
For those seeking **nirvāṇa**, a **"phantom city"** shown,  
A greater journey awaits, for souls widely known.  
The **Eternal Buddha**, no mere historical span,  
But **omnipresent reality**, for every woman and man.  
**Universal Buddhahood**, inherent in all souls,  
No hierarchy, no limits, achieving ultimate goals.  
  
**Expedient means** (**upāya**), a compassionate guide,  
Like the **burning house's parable**, where children could hide.  
Yet, for Tiantai, **the raft is not cast away**,  
But **"the raft factory...floats on every raft,"** day by day.  
**Samsara is Nirvāṇa**, a **perfect and sudden** leap,  
No dualistic struggle, but a truth to keep.  
  
Part III  
  
The struggle manifests, from **internal and outer** strife,  
**Karma and *kleśas***, entwined in our life.  
**Ignorance** (*avidyā*), **attachment** (*rāga*), **aversion's** (*dveṣa*) dark hold,  
The **"three poisons"** within, a story untold.  
These **mind poisons**, our habits and attachments deep,  
Make upholding the Sutra, a challenge to keep.  
The teaching: **"ignorance and *kleśas* are indivisible from *bodhi***,"  
A profound challenge to dualistic reality.  
  
In the **Latter Day of the Law** (*mappō*), an **"age of conflict"** known,  
**External opposition**, fiercely is shown.  
**Hatred and jealousy**, even from monks, arise.  
As **Nichiren** faced, beneath persecuting skies.  
He **"read the Lotus Sutra with his very life,"** bold,  
For **hardship was proof**, a truth to be told.  
The external strife, **a cure's efficacy** makes plain,  
A mirror of internal vice, easing suffering's pain.  
  
Yet, the **immeasurable value** shines through the fray,  
A **single moment of faith**, illuminates the way.  
More merit than eons of practice, the Sutra proclaims,  
**"A moment of rejoicing,"** fulfilling Dharma's aims.  
It's not about earning, but **aligning with the Mystic Law**,  
Which is **timeless, eternal**, beyond earthly flaw.  
**Three thousand realms in a single thought**, profoundly deep,  
A **quantum leap** from linearity, secrets to keep.  
  
To **"uphold"** (*juji*) means to embody, to transform, to live,  
The **"five practices,"** the **Daimoku**, all it can give.  
Like **polishing a mirror**, our Buddha-nature gleams,  
Through **Sadāparibhūta's** unwavering dreams.  
He bowed to all, seeing Buddhahood within,  
For **persecution itself, becomes the path** to begin.  
  
The difficulty, then, is **testament to value's might**,  
A **cosmic commission**, igniting inner light.  
The **struggle against hindrances**, both outward and in,  
**Defines the bodhisattva's practice**, where victories begin.  
A **single moment of valor**, piercing delusion's veil,  
Transforming **"poison" to "medicine,"** beyond failure's wail.  
Bringing the **Jeweled Stupa to life**, in this turbulent sphere,  
Making ultimate reality, vibrantly clear.
