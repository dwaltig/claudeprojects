# The Lotus Unfurls  
  
Beneath the mud, a seed lies still,  
A truth unspoken, vast and deep—  
All rivers run to one great will,  
In every heart, a Buddha sleeps.  
  
A whisper stirs the silent air,  
A name, a call, a fleeting sound—  
The mind awakes, begins to dare,  
A path is named where none was found.  
  
Through shadows cast by thought’s own flame,  
A mirror gleams, a calm takes hold—  
The world dissolves, yet stays the same,  
In stillness, wisdom’s tale is told.  
  
A bloom half-opened, soft and near,  
Reflects the sun in dewdrop’s gleam—  
The self fades out, the truth grows clear,  
A life aligns with waking dream.  
  
Petals part, the light pours through,  
Each step a shard of night undone—  
The boundless shines in all we do,  
A thousand realms in breath begun.  
  
At last, the flower knows its root,  
No veil remains, no doubt to bear—  
The seed, the bloom, the final fruit,  
One timeless truth in all things there.
