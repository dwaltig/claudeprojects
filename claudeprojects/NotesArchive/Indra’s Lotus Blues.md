**Lyrics:**  
Verse 1  
From my heavenly throne, I gaze below,  
Śāriputra's wisdom starts to grow.  
Burning house, a mortal's fear,  
Buddha's truth, so crystal clear.  
  
Chorus  
Lotus blooms, a sight so grand,  
Even gods can understand.  
Buddha's love, a boundless sky,  
Shines on all, both low and high.  
  
Verse 2  
I've seen kingdoms rise, and empires fall,  
But the Dharma's truth outlasts them all.  
Human hearts, with burdens deep,  
Find solace in the Lotus, they weep.  
  
Chorus  
Lotus blooms, a sight so grand,  
Even gods can understand.  
Buddha's love, a boundless sky,  
Shines on all, both low and high.  
  
Reprise Verse 2  
I've seen kingdoms rise, and empires fall,

Chorus  
Lotus blooms, a sight so grand,  
Even gods can understand.  
Buddha's love, a boundless sky,  
Shines on all, both low and high.  
  
Bridge  
Though the world is filled with pain,  
Hope flickers, like a candle's flame.  
In every soul, a Buddha's light,  
Waiting to break through the night.  
  
Chorus  
Lotus blooms, a sight so grand,  
Even gods can understand.  
Buddha's love, a boundless sky,  
Shines on all, both low and high.  
  
Outro  
From my realm, I sing this plea,  
Let the Lotus set you free.  
Awakening's dawn, a joyful sound,  
Peace and love, on earthly ground.
