Thanks again for the offer and your enthusiasm! While my primary focus right now is on organic growth and building a strong foundation, I'm definitely interested in exploring opportunities that could further my career, including potential record label deals. I'd be happy to connect with your friends and learn more about what they do. Could you share a bit about their experience and the types of artists they work with? It would be helpful to see if there's a good fit. Thanks again, William dwaltig@gmail.com
