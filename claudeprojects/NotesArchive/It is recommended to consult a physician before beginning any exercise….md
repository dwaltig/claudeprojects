**It is recommended to consult a physician before beginning any exercise program**. The following exercise routine is suitable for a 63 year old man with little exercise experience, and is based on the principles of progressive calisthenics and the Charles Atlas Dynamic-Tension system.  
**The program consists of two workouts per week, performed on non-consecutive days**. Each workout will focus on a few simple, compound exercises that work the whole body. The goal is to gradually increase the number of repetitions and the difficulty of the exercises over time.  
**It is important to start slowly and gradually increase the intensity of the workouts**. Listen to your body and stop if you feel any pain.  
**Workout A**  
* **Wall Pushups:** 1 set of 10 repetitions.  
* **Pullups (assisted if needed):** 1 set of as many repetitions as possible.  
* **Bodyweight Squats:** 1 set of 10 repetitions.  
* **Knee Tucks:** 1 set of 10 repetitions.  
**Workout B**  
* **Incline Pushups:** 1 set of 10 repetitions.  
* **Horizontal Rows (using a table or sturdy object):** 1 set of as many repetitions as possible.  
* **Chair Squats:** 1 set of 10 repetitions.  
* **Leg Raises (knee bent):** 1 set of 10 repetitions.  
**Important Considerations for Exercise:**  
* **Warming Up:** Perform a light warm up of joint circling followed by 2-3 easier variations of the exercise you are planning on working with before each workout.  
* **Cooling Down:** After completing each workout, it is important to cool down by performing some light stretching. Hold each stretch for 30 seconds.  
* **Nutrition:** It is important to eat a healthy diet and get enough sleep to support your workouts. Aim for at least three balanced meals a day with one healthy snack.  
* **Consistency and Patience:** The key to success is to be consistent with your workouts and to be patient with your progress. Results will not happen overnight, but with dedication and effort, you will see improvements in your strength and fitness over time.
