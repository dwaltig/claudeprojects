# The Needle on Sumeru’s Peak  
  
[intro] imagine this, mountain touchin the rim of the stars needle on the tip, thread in the wind—how you gonna land that listen close…  
  
[verse 1] sumeru rises, spine of the universe peak so cold you can’t measure the curse needle so thin it can split what’s real thread in the gust plays roulette with the steel odds like zero but i still breathe belief nichiren taught me to flip that grief rarer than a bullseye on that chrome is chanting a phrase that can open your home lose myself? nah, i locate grace five-sound mantra in a tight embrace my triumphs fade like fog at dawn this law is the light that i’m counting on  
  
[hook] myoh-hoh ren-geh kyoh, say what mystic law in the stereo thread that needle? maybe no but this chant makes the impossible grow myoh-hoh ren-geh kyoh, let’s go heartbeat drum when the blessings flow mountain high but the door’s unlocked lotus bloom in the boombox rock  
  
[verse 2] everyday hustle got a glitch in the code chasing that gold till the edges corrode then i remember the wind-tossed silk i’m richer than kings with a cup of this milk spirit gets fractured, chant is the seam stitches my purpose, levels my dream blind man seeing his folks again can’t top the joy of a single nam grain age-old karma paid in full law so deep it rewrites the skull needle might wait on frozen stone but i got dharma right here in the phone  
  
[hook] myoh-hoh ren-geh kyoh, say what mystic law in the stereo thread that needle? maybe no but this chant makes the impossible grow myoh-hoh ren-geh kyoh, let’s go heartbeat drum when the blessings flow mountain high but the door’s unlocked lotus bloom in the boombox rock  
  
[bridge] open up the gate, hear the sutra sing petals in the dust where the streetlights cling needle in the cloud, thread on the breeze but the law lives loud in the breath i squeeze  
  
[final hook] myoh-hoh ren-geh kyoh, say what myoh-hoh ren-geh kyoh, let’s go myoh-hoh ren-geh kyoh, [echo and fade]
