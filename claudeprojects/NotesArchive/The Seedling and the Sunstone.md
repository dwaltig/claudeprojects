Lyrics:  
(Verse 1) In the forest, dark and deep, A tiny seedling, fast asleep, Woke to shadows, cold and gray, Longing for the sun's bright ray. Towering trees, a leafy crown, Kept the little seedling down. "I'll never reach," it softly sighed,  
"So small, so small," it softly cried,  
"In endless darkness, I must hide."  
  
(Chorus) Oh, the Sunstone, warm and bright, A whisper of the hidden light. Hold it close, and have no fear, The sun is always, always near. Though shadows fall and doubts may rise, Faith will guide you to the skies.  
  
(Verse 2) A wise old owl, with eyes so keen, Saw the sorrow, felt unseen. Brought a stone, a gentle glow, "Sunstone," whispered, soft and low. "Carry this, a sacred trust, Though the sun is veiled in dust. Feel its warmth, its inner fire, Let it fuel your heart's desire."  
  
(Chorus) Oh, the Sunstone, warm and bright, A whisper of the hidden light. Hold it close, and have no fear, The sun is always, always near. Though shadows fall and doubts may rise, Faith will guide you to the skies.  
  
(Verse 3) The seedling held the stone so tight, Felt the warmth, the guiding light. Grew through darkness, storm, and strife, Clinging to the hope of life. Other seedlings, lost and weak, Never learned the truth to seek. But the seedling, strong and bold, Kept the faith the Sunstone told.  
  
(Chorus) Oh, the Sunstone, warm and bright, A whisper of the hidden light. Hold it close, and have no fear, The sun is always, always near. Though shadows fall and doubts may rise, Faith will guide you to the skies.  
  
(Verse 4) Years went by, a patient climb, Through the tangled web of time. Then one day, a golden gleam, Broke the canopy's dark dream. Sunlight bathed the sapling tall, Standing proud, above them all. Looked below, with knowing eyes, At the Sunstone's gentle prize.  
  
(Outro) The Sunstone glows, a memory, Of the faith that set it free. So keep your faith, let it take hold, Brighter than the sun, more valuable than Gold. The light is there, though you may roam, Faith's the Sunstone, leads you home. The light is there, you have to trust, The Sunstone's faith will turn you from dust.
