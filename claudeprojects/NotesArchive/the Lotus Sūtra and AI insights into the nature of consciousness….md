Excellent! That sounds like a productive plan. Taking the time for deep research will undoubtedly enrich the book's content and ensure a comprehensive exploration of the topics.  
Here's a potential approach to your research, keeping in mind the AI assistance you'll be utilizing:  
 * Divide and Conquer:  
   * Break down the book's sections into smaller, more manageable research topics. For example, "The Concept of Buddhahood and AGI" can be further divided into "Definitions of Buddhahood," "Current Understandings of AGI," and "Potential Parallels."  
 * Utilize AI for Information Gathering:  
   * Use AI tools to gather relevant information from academic databases, scholarly articles, Buddhist texts, and technological publications.  
   * Focus on extracting key concepts, definitions, and arguments.  
   * Remember to cross-reference information from multiple sources to ensure accuracy and avoid biases.  
 * Comparative Analysis:  
   * Compare and contrast the concepts of the Lotus Sūtra with current AI research.  
   * Identify areas of overlap, divergence, and potential synergy.  
   * AI can be used for that, by asking it to compare, and contrast specific topics.  
 * Ethical Considerations:  
   * Pay close attention to the ethical implications of AI development and deployment, particularly in relation to the principles of the Lotus Sūtra.  
   * Explore different ethical frameworks and perspectives.  
 * Creative Application:  
   * Think creatively about how the parables and teachings of the Lotus Sūtra can be applied to contemporary AI scenarios.  
   * Use AI to generate thought-provoking examples and thought experiments.  
 * Personal Reflection:  
   * Integrate your own insights and reflections into the research process.  
   * Your unique perspective will add depth and authenticity to the book.  
 * Organization:  
   * Keep careful notes, and organize your research. Using AI based tools to organize large amounts of data, can be very helpful.  
Remember, AI is a powerful tool for research, but it's essential to maintain your critical thinking skills and rely on your own judgment. Good luck with your research, and I look forward to hearing about your progress.
