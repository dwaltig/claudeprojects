And they smell the shravakas' scent. The pratyekabuddhas' scent. The Bodhisattvas' scent. The Buddhas' body-scent.   
  
They smell it all from far away. They know exactly where each one is.  
  
And even though they smelling all this, their nose don't get damaged. Don't get broke. Don't get confused.  
  
If they want to tell somebody else, want to explain what they smelling—they remember it perfect. Don't get it wrong.
