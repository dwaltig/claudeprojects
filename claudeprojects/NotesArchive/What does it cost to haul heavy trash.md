# What does it cost to haul heavy trash?  
  
I did some research. Here is what I discovered.

** Bulky-Trash Headache: Let’s Decide Together**  
Hi neighbors! We keep finding dumped couches, mattresses, etc. Because our 112-unit community is *not* on the City of Houston’s “Tree & Junk Waste” route, we must hire a private hauler whenever we clean up.  
**Typical market rate (2025):** a 16-cubic-yard truck, crew included, ≈ **$500 per sweep**. ▸ One full truck holds about 5 pickup-loads of furniture. ▸ Landfill fees + labor are built in.  
**2 options for a scheduled contract**  

| Option | How much junk? | Cost to HOA | Cost per unit | Notes |
| --------------------- | -------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A. 1 truck / quarter | Up to 16 cu yd | $500 every 3 mos | $4.46 per home / quarter
(≈ $18 / yr) | We’d all need to load items into a central area the night before haul-off. |
| B. 2 trucks / quarter | Up to 32 cu yd | $1,000 every 3 mos | $8.93 per home / quarter
(≈ $36 / yr) | More breathing room if several homes renovate at once. |
  
**Current policy** = no contract, fines for violators. A single surprise pickup (mattress, sofa) costs $75-$100 and eats the budget fast if we can’t trace the culprit.  
**Please vote**  
  
**by sharing one choice:**  
  
 Go with **Option A** – minimal contract, $4-5 per quarter   
 Choose **Option B** – larger contract, $9 per quarter  
  
 **Keep status-quo** (no contract, continue fines)   
Thanks for taking 15 seconds to vote. Your response helps the board lock in fair, cost-effective service (or stick with fines) before summer move-outs pile up the junk.
