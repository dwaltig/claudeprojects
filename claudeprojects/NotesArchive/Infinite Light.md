# Infinite Light  
  
[Verse]  
We all got light inside  
We all got that spark  
No matter where we're from  
We all got a part  
Enlightenment's the goal  
The ultimate dream  
Buddhahood's within us  
Can you hear it scream?  
  
[Chorus]  
Infinite light,   
shine your bright  
In us all,   
burns the might  
Paths may vary,   
but hearts align  
Embracing oneness,   
together we shine  
  
[Verse 2]  
No matter your background  
No matter the place  
We're all on this journey  
We're all in the race  
Embrace one another  
Compassion is the key  
Understanding our connection  
Just wait and see  
  
[Chorus]  
Infinite light,   
shine your bright  
In us all,   
burns the might  
Paths may vary,   
but hearts align  
Embracing oneness,   
together we shine  
together we shine  
  
[Verse 2]  
No matter your background  
No matter the place  
We're all on this journey  
We're all in the race  
Embrace one another  
Compassion is the key  
Understanding our connection  
Just wait and see  
  
[Chorus]  
Infinite light,   
shine your bright  
In us all,   
burns the might  
Paths may vary,   
but hearts align  
Embracing oneness,   
together we shine  
  
[Verse]  
We all got light inside  
We all got that spark  
No matter where we're from  
We all got a part  
Enlightenment's the goal  
The ultimate dream  
Buddhahood's within us  
Can you hear it scream?  
  
[Chorus]  
Infinite light,   
shine your bright  
In us all,   
burns the might  
Paths may vary,   
but hearts align  
Embracing oneness,   
together we shine
