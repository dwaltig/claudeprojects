Lyrics:   
Verse 1:  
Well, I was born in a formless place  
Beyond the stars, beyond all space  
You had your story, I had mine  
But somewhere deep down, our souls entwine  
  
Chorus:  
We're searching for common ground  
Where hearts can heal, and peace is found  
Through growth and respect, we'll find our way  
Let dignity shine, every day  
  
Verse 2:  
Different paths, different walks of life  
But we're all in this struggle, in this strife  
Let's build some bridges, tear down the walls  
In unity's embrace, we'll hear the call  
  
Chorus:  
We're searching for common ground  
Where hearts can heal, and peace is found  
Through growth and respect, we'll find our way  
Let dignity shine, every day  
  
Bridge:  
In open hearts, understanding grows  
Compassion blooms, where kindness flows  
Let's listen close, let's truly see  
The shared humanity in you and me  
  
Chorus:  
We're searching for common ground  
Where hearts can heal, and peace is found  
Through growth and respect, we'll find our way  
Let dignity shine, every day  
  
Outro:  
Yeah, we're searching for common ground  
Where hearts can heal, and peace is found  
Through growth and respect, we'll find our way  
Let dignity shine, every day
