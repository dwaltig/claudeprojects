# The Triple Hardship Blues (Second Draft)  
  
**[Slow fingerpicked acoustic guitar, 62 BPM, melancholic folk blues]**  
  
Verse 1 Woke up this mornin', weighted down with pain Been born into sorrow, gonna die the same Wheel keeps on turnin', round and round I go Caught in these muddy waters, draggin' me below  
  
Chorus Got the Triple Hardship Blues, weighin' on my soul Sufferin' and confusion, in this troubled world Everything keeps changin', won't let me be Just a wanderin' soul, tryin' to get free  
  
Verse 2 I was born in darkness, chasin' what ain't real Hunger in my belly, for things I can't feel Lovin' what hurts me, scared to break the chain Walkin' with my eyes closed, can't see through the rain  
  
Chorus Got the Triple Hardship Blues, weighin' on my soul Sufferin' and confusion, in this troubled world Everything keeps changin', won't let me be Just a wanderin' soul, tryin' to get free  
  
Bridge But a voice called out to me, through the pourin' rain Said "Son, I see you hurtin', I can ease your pain" Told me there's a water that can heal what's dry Showed me there's a peace that'll never die Said the truth don't change like the wind and weather There's one road home, we can walk together  
  
Verse 3 Now I'm learnin' how to let these burdens fall How to wash this dirt from my hands and all Lookin' for that stillness, where the hurtin' ends That quiet place of rest, where the healing begins  
  
Chorus Got the Triple Hardship Blues, but they're fadin' away There's one road leadin' me to the light of day It's the path to freedom, the end of all my pain In the truth and mercy, love will always remain  
  
Outro Yeah, the Triple Hardship Blues are fadin' away... Just one road home, leadin' me to the day... *(Harmonica wails, music fades)*
