Lyrics:   
**Verse 1** Oh, Brahma angels, glowing bright, With chariots gleaming, pure as light, You who cross the multiverse wide, Carry this song where truth resides.  
  
**Pre-Chorus** Through glittering skies, your wings unfold, On winds of wisdom, pure and bold, The world awaits your healing sound, A song of peace, where love is found.  
  
**Chorus** Celestial wings, take this prayer, To hearts in need, to souls laid bare. From this small spark, let flames arise, A hymn of hope through endless skies.  
  
**Verse 2** Great Lord of Knowledge, ancient guide, Your voice resounds where stars abide. Grant us the strength, the courage to sing, And share your truth with everything.  
  
**Pre-Chorus** Through radiant realms, your wisdom flows, Where time dissolves, compassion grows. Unite the worlds with melody, A bridge of light, a cosmic sea.  
  
**Chorus** Celestial wings, take this prayer, To hearts in need, to souls laid bare. From this small spark, let flames arise, A hymn of hope through endless skies.  
  
**Bridge** At this great juncture, on the edge of dawn, A burst of knowing, a brighter song. Angels of Brahma, hear my plea, Carry this music, set it free.  
  
**Final Chorus** Celestial wings, take this prayer, To hearts in need, to souls laid bare. From this small spark, let flames arise, A hymn of hope through endless skies.  
  
**Outro** Oh, Brahma angels, ever near, May your light guide, may all things clear. Together we sing, together we rise, To share this truth where wisdom lies.
