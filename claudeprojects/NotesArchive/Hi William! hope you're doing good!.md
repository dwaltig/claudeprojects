Hi William! hope you're doing good!  
  
Just letting you know  
  
We created this account here 1 year ago, as you can see from the upload time of the track  
soundcloud.com/pp_rec/tracks (1 year ago)  
  
We have also more followers as well, because our account is the real one and older.  
  
The getaudiohype benefit "service" you used reposted your track with this account  
soundcloud.com/ppinnkjuice/tracks (created 6 months ago)  
  
Looks pretty much the same, right?  
  
Don't be fooled and use the REAL ONE instead of this copy-and-paste bot promotion and you get real results. These people copy other real organic music networks since months to exploit their identity &amp; name and then scam you with an army of bots.  
  
Option 1:  Direct and to the point  
> Thanks for the heads up! I appreciate you looking out for artists. I'll be sure to stick with your network for any future promotions.  
>   
Option 2:  Expressing your appreciation  
> Wow, thanks for letting me know! It's really helpful to have a community that warns each other about these scams. I'll definitely be more careful in the future.  
>   
Option 3:  A bit more assertive  
> That's good to know. I'm glad I didn't fall for that fake account. Thanks for protecting your brand and the SoundCloud community.  
>   
Option 4:  Asking a question  
> Thanks for the warning! How can I be sure to identify other fake accounts like this in the future?  
>   
No matter which option you choose, you can also consider:  
 * Reporting the fake account:  You can report "soundcloud.com/ppinnkjuice/tracks [invalid URL removed] [invalid URL removed]" to SoundCloud for impersonation or spam.  
 * Sharing the warning:  You could share this information with other artists you know to help them avoid the same scam.  
By responding and taking action, you're helping to create a safer and more trustworthy environment on SoundCloud.
