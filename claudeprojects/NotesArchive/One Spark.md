Intro (Spoken Over Beat)  
Yo, we all walk through the fire.  
Through the rain, through the struggle—but one spark? That’s all it takes.  
  
Verse 1 (Rap)  
I’ve been grindin’, walkin’ through flames,  
Storms in my mind, playin’ mental games.  
Givin’ love, holdin’ grace in my hands,  
But one second of trust—it’s where it all lands.  
  
Chorus (Sung Hook)  
🎤 Just a moment of faith, it’s all I need,  
A seed in the struggle, a spark in the weeds.  
Through the storms and the trials, I find my way,  
That one little spark lights up my day.  
  
Verse 2 (Rap)  
Years gone by, I’ve been building this path,  
Givin’ my all, do the work, do the math.  
But it’s faith—not silver or gold—that weighs more,  
One belief in the light? Opens every door.  
  
Bridge (Spoken Word)  
They’ll tell you to doubt, tell you to quit,  
But faith? It’s the fire that’ll never dim.  
Step by step, I’ve learned to see,  
That trust in the process sets me free.  
  
Outro (Fade with Choir-Like Harmony)  
🎤 Oh, just a moment, and the path is clear,  
The strength of belief—it’s always near.
