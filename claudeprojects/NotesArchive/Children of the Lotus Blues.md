# Children of the Lotus Blues  
  
A soulful blues folk rendition of Buddhist wisdom teachings, "Children of the Lotus Blues" weaves ancient spiritual concepts into an accessible American roots framework. The song tells the story of enlightened children seeking truth while featuring haunting call-and-response vocals that echo traditional spirituals. Backed by sparse, emotive acoustic guitar work, the gentle thrum of stand-up bass, and mournful harmonica interludes, this contemplative piece bridges Eastern philosophy and Western folk traditions. The lyrics transform the formal structure of the Lotus Sutra's teachings into an intimate, accessible journey that resonates across cultural boundaries while maintaining spiritual authenticity.

**Lyrics: **  
**Verse 1:**   
Dawn was breakin', light was shakin'   
When those children put their toys away   
Hearts on fire, souls reachin' higher   
Seekin' out the Buddha's Way,   
(oh yeah, Seekin' out the Buddha's Way)  
  
**Chorus:**   
Tell us the truth, oh wise one   
Set our troubled souls free   
Show us the light within us   
Show what we all can be  
  
**Verse 2:**   
Minds like water, clear and knowin'   
They bowed before their father wise   
No gold or treasure could they measure   
Against the truth before their eyes,   
(oh Lord, Against the truth before their eyes)  
  
**Chorus:**   
Tell us the truth, oh wise one   
Set our troubled souls free   
Show us the light within us   
Show what we all can be  
  
**Bridge:**   
"If we reach that other shore," they said   
"Others can follow too   
The path we walk, the chains we break   
Will help all beings break through"   
(Help all beings break through)  
  
**Verse 3:**   
While we're walkin' through this valley   
Caught in sufferin's endless wheel   
These children show the way to go   
Where wisdom's flame burns real, so real,  
(Where wisdom's flame burns real)  
  
**Chorus:**   
Tell us the truth, oh wise one   
Set our troubled souls free   
Show us the light within us   
Show what we all can be  
  
**Verse 4:**   
Like a lotus in the water   
The Dharma blooms in every heart   
From the darkness into brightness   
We've been Buddhas from the start,   
my friend,    
(We've been Buddhas from the start)  
  
**Final Chorus:**   
Tell us the truth, oh wise one   
Set our troubled souls free   
Show us the light within us   
Show what we all can be   
(Show what we all can be)   
(Show what we all can be)
