## Tackling the Trash Challenge: What the Board is Discussing About Heavy Dumping  
  
The issue of heavy trash dumping continues to be a central topic of discussion for the Community Association Board, particularly due to the significant financial burden it places on all homeowners [1, 2]. During the recent September 2025 meeting, the Board addressed the mounting costs and logistical hurdles associated with unauthorized disposal of large items, primarily driven by renters [3, 4].  
  
### The Costly Reality of Heavy Trash  
  
The association is currently paying to have heavy trash hauled off property, and the costs are substantial [4-6]. This financial strain may ultimately lead to an increase in association fees to accommodate the "additional charge" [2, 7].  
  
A major factor contributing to the expense is the disposal of specific items, such as **mattresses** [8, 9]. Mattresses, in particular, must undergo biohazard treatment before they can be taken to a landfill, which significantly raises the cost of removal [8, 10].  
  
The sources noted that many of the issues—including large items like couches, tables, and even contents from entire units (referred to as "mini haul out")—are often traced back to tenants, particularly when they move out and "just trash everything" [3, 4, 11].  
  
### Proposed Solutions and Enforcement  
  
The Board considered several strategies to curtail unauthorized dumping and manage disposal responsibly:  
  
**1. Designated Heavy Trash Area and Restrictions:**  
One idea discussed was establishing a **central trash enclosure** specifically for heavy trash [1, 12, 13]. Alongside this, the Board proposed limiting disposal to **"one heavy item per unit per month"** [14, 15]. However, some members expressed concern that limiting disposal to one item per month might be "unrealistic" and difficult to enforce [13, 15].  
  
**2. Surveillance and Fining:**  
A key component of the proposed plan involves leveraging surveillance technology. The Board discussed posting notices that the designated heavy trash area is covered by **surveillance cameras** [1, 12]. Currently, a camera on Building 7 is "eyeing the gate, the back gate, and the dumpster" [16].  
  
The goal of increased surveillance is to gather the "documented proof" or "evidence" necessary to **fine offenders** [17, 18]. If violations are confirmed, the fines would be levied against the unit owners, who are responsible for the actions of their tenants [19].  
  
**3. Negotiated Removal:**  
Homeowners or renters who have multiple items could contact the porter, Eric, and negotiate a price for him to haul the items off property [4, 14].  
  
### Rules for Hazardous and Large Items  
  
The sources highlighted existing obligations for residents when disposing of certain items:  
  
*   **Refrigerators:** These contain hazardous chemicals (refrigerant) that must be removed by a ****licensed HVAC person**** before disposal. Additionally, the door must be taken off [20, 21].  
*   **Multiple Items:** Owners are not permitted to simply "dump everything out there and expect somebody to haul it off for them”.  
  
### Challenges and Next Steps  
  
The Board recognized that enforcement is complex, especially since many renters may not adhere to community rules, claiming ignorance. Furthermore, offenders often dump items "at midnight," making eyewitness accounts difficult. While the cameras could provide documentation, full coverage of all dumpsters is not yet implemented.  
  
The discussion around implementing a restricted heavy trash area, raising dues to cover costs, and increasing surveillance was active, with members providing differing views on the feasibility of imposing limits on dumping. Ultimately, the Board decided to **table** the heavy trash enclosure bid and the proposed rules to "put some more thought into it" and revisit the issue next month.  
  
The Board aims to establish a rule and set restrictions, hoping that knowledge of the cameras will "deflect some of them" from illegal dumping, even if it doesn't solve the problem entirely.
