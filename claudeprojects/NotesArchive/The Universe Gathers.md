[Intro]  
  
((Verse 1)  
On Vulture Peak, where the winds do call,  
The Buddha sat with his chosen all,  
Twelve hundred Arhats, pure and wise,  
Freed from the world, with opened eyes.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, the mountains hum with a sacred sound,  
Wisdom and compassion all around,  
From realms afar, they gathered near,  
To hear the words that brought us clear.  
  
(Verse 2)  
Śāriputra, with a mind so bright,  
Maudgalyāyana, in the mystic night,  
Kāśyapa, strong and true,  
Each with a heart that's shining new.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, the mountains hum with a sacred sound,  
Wisdom and compassion all around,  
From realms afar, they gathered near,  
To hear the words that brought us clear.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
(Bridge)  
In the blues of the night, the stars align,  
Hearts awaken, and spirits find,  
In the echoes of truth, we all unite,  
Under the moon's soft silver light.  
  
(Verse 3)  
Then came the Bodhisattvas, kind and strong,  
Mañjuśrī’s wisdom led them along,  
Avalokiteśvara, with Compassion’s hand,  
Guided all to the promised land.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, the mountains hum with a sacred sound,  
Wisdom and compassion all around,  
From realms afar, they gathered near,  
To hear the words that brought us clear.  
  
(Verse 4)  
The Nāgas, the Devas, the Asuras too,  
All stood in awe as the teaching grew,  
From every realm, they bowed in grace,  
Seeking truth in the Buddha’s face.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, the mountains hum with a sacred sound,  
Wisdom and compassion all around,  
From realms afar, they gathered near,  
To hear the words that brought us clear.  
  
(Outro)  
So let us gather, hearts in tune,  
Under the light of the Buddha’s moon,  
In the blues of life, we find our way,  
Guided by the words of the Buddha’s day.  
Guided by the words of the Buddha’s day.
