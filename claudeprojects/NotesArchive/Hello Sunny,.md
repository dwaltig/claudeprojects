Hello Sunny,  
  
Thank you for reaching out and considering me for this opportunity. It's exciting to hear about the expansion and new tutoring modes your friend's agency is introducing.   
  
Here's a breakdown of my proposed hourly rates:  
  
1. **1-to-1 Sessions**: For these personalized sessions, I would charge $50 per hour. This rate reflects the individual attention and customized teaching approach each student will receive. It also aligns with the industry standards for specialized subjects like economics.  
  
2. **1-to-3/4 Sessions**: For small group sessions with 3 to 4 students, I propose a rate of $25 per student per hour. This pricing not only makes the sessions more accessible for each student but also ensures fair compensation for the broader coverage and interaction these sessions demand. With this structure, a session with 3 students would total $75 per hour, and with 4 students, it would be $100 per hour.  
  
I believe these rates balance the need for quality education with affordability. They are also structured to reflect the differing dynamics and benefits of individual versus small group learning.  
  
If there are specific requirements or expectations from the agency's side, such as session length, curriculum design, or assessment responsibilities, I'm open to discussing and adjusting the rates accordingly.   
  
I'm also interested in understanding more about the platform and tools that will be used for these virtual sessions, as well as any support or resources the agency might provide.   
  
Looking forward to a fruitful collaboration.  
  
Best regards,  
William
