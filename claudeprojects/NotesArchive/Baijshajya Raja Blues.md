Verse 1:

For all the souls, the young and the old  
Who keep this Sutra, written or told

Gonna shield your spirit in every place"

These chants be your defensive frame  
(Full band, high energy)  
A shield against harm in every game  
Through darkest night and brightest day  
These sacred words will light your way
