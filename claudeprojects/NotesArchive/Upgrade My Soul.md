Verse 1    
I’m lost in the noise of this digital age,    
Scrolling for answers, trapped on the page.    
But there’s a master key, it’s ancient and true,    
The Lotus Sutra whispers, "It’s all within you."  
  
 Chorus    
Upgrade my soul, rewrite my code,    
Guide me through the heavy load.    
A timeless truth in a fleeting time,    
Awakening hearts, one verse, one line.    
  
 Verse 2    
Like a network of wisdom, it lights up my mind,    
A fiber optic bridge to truths I couldn’t find.    
No need for quick fixes, no temporary patch,    
This is the source code no trend can match.    
  
 Chorus    
Upgrade my soul, rewrite my code,    
Guide me through the heavy load.    
A timeless truth in a fleeting time,    
Awakening hearts, one verse, one line.    
  
 Bridge    
(Spoken or sung softly with light instrumentation)    
It’s not just an app, it’s the whole design,    
A renewable power that transcends time.    
From climate fears to feeling alone,    
The Sutra reminds me, we’re never on our own.    
  
 Verse 3    
It’s the solar power for my weary heart,    
Sustainable light when the world falls apart.    
Through all the updates and fleeting trends,    
The Sutra’s wisdom, like love, never ends.    
  
 Chorus    
Upgrade my soul, rewrite my code,    
Guide me through the heavy load.    
A timeless truth in a fleeting time,    
Awakening hearts, one verse, one line.    
  
 Verse 4    
Like mugwort straightened in a field of hemp,    
Or a crooked soul finding the strength to repent.    
The Sutra’s a teacher, a path to align,    
Its lessons eternal, transcending the time.    
  
 Final Chorus    
Upgrade my soul, rewrite my code,    
Guide me through the heavy load.    
The Dharma sings in a quiet tone,    
Reminding us all, we’re never alone.    
  
 Outro    
(Soft and reflective)    
In a world of updates, trends that fade,    
The Lotus Sutra’s light won’t degrade.    
It’s the operating system for a weary soul,    
An eternal upgrade that makes us whole.
