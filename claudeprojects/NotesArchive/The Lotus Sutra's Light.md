# The Lotus Sutra's Light  
  
  
  
[Verse 1]  
In the pages of an ancient book  
Lies a truth that's yours to find  
The Lotus Sutra, king of all  
Enlightenment for humankind  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, the Lotus Sutra's light  
Guides us through the darkest night  
Faith and wisdom hand in hand  
Lead us to the promised land  
  
[Verse 2]  
A thousand Buddhas watch our way  
As we chant with all our might  
Pure lands await, a golden dawn  
For those who seek the highest sight  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, the Lotus Sutra's light  
Guides us through the darkest night  
Faith and wisdom hand in hand  
Lead us to the promised land  
  
[Bridge]  
It may be hard to understand  
But with an open heart we'll see  
The path to joy, the end of pain  
The way to set our spirits free  
  
[Verse 3]  
So let us study day by day  
This teaching pure and bright  
In every verse, in every line  
We'll find the strength to do what's right  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, the Lotus Sutra's light  
Guides us through the darkest night  
Faith and wisdom hand in hand  
Lead us to the promised land  
  
[Outro]  
The Lotus Sutra shows the way  
To Buddhahood for you and me
