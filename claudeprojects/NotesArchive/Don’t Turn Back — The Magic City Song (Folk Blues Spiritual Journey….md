Lyrics:  
[Verse 1]  
We walked the road through dust and fear,  
The night fell cold, the path unclear.  
He turned and spoke with steady grace:  
“Do not be afraid — rest in this place.”  
  
[Chorus]  
Don’t turn back, don’t lose your way,  
This city glows, but won’t long stay.  
Beyond the dream, there’s more to see —  
The treasure calls, come walk with me.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Our hearts grew soft, we made our bed,  
Content with shelter, safely fed.  
But whispers rose beyond the gate:  
“Stay here too long — you’ll miss your fate.”  
  
[Chorus]  
Don’t turn back, don’t lose your way,  
This city soothes, but fades away.  
The truest treasure is yet ahead —  
Awake, arise, leave comfort’s thread.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[Bridge] (gentle, yearning)  
The city fades, the vision clears,  
The sky expands beyond our fears.  
The road is long, but love is near —  
The guide walks on, dissolving fear.  
  
[Final Chorus]  
Don’t turn back, step through the door,  
Each step reveals a little more.  
The treasure waits beyond desire —  
Walk on, walk on, through truth and fire.  
  
[Outro]  
Rest if you must — the pause is kind,  
But don’t mistake the peace you find.  
The light ahead will pull you through —  
The city fades… but truth is true.
