# Ever-Present Light  
  
In realms of being, light resides, A Buddha-nature deep inside. Not distant goal, but here and now, Awakening’s gentle, sacred vow.  
  
Compassion’s well, forever flows, For every joy and every woe. Eloquence, a song so clear, Dispelling darkness, calming fear.  
  
Power unbound, a fearless heart, To play in life’s unfolding part. Concentration, a steady gaze, Through shifting tides and winding ways.  
  
Emancipation’s gentle breeze, Releasing from all unease. Insight dawns, a wisdom bright, Illuminating endless night.  
  
A truth revealed, forever new, What we seek is already true. In every soul, a light so grand, To touch the world with loving hand.  
  
So let us rise, and let us be, The boundless light for all to see. Awakened hearts, forever free, Embracing our reality.
