Verse 1:  
In a world of harsh words spoken,    
Where doubt can cloud the mind,    
The Buddha speaks of kindness,    
A wisdom that's so rare to find.    
A man may curse and scorn him,    
For a thousand years or more,    
But the harm done to a seeker,    
Hurts deeper than any war.    
  
Chorus:    
Oh, Medicine-King, hear the call,    
Protect those who stumble, those who fall,    
For words can cut or heal the soul,    
In the journey towards the goal.    
  
Verse 2:    
To slander one who's walking,    
This path so new, so true,    
Is a sin much deeper,    
Than attacking the Enlightened View.    
For the Buddha stands unshaken,    
By words meant to defame,    
But a novice may be broken,    
By even the slightest blame.    
  
Chorus:    
Oh, Medicine-King, hear the call,    
Protect those who stumble, those who fall,    
For words can cut or heal the soul,    
In the journey towards the goal.    
  
Bridge:    
So let us speak with kindness,    
Let our words be light and true,    
For the path is long and winding,    
And we all are passing through.    
Encourage every seeker,    
With love and gentle care,    
For we walk this road together,    
With a truth that all can share.    
  
Chorus:    
Oh, Medicine-King, hear the call,    
Protect those who stumble, those who fall,    
For words can cut or heal the soul,    
In the journey towards the goal.    
  
Outro:    
Remember the Buddha's teaching,    
In every word and deed,    
To lift each other higher,    
And plant compassion's seed.
