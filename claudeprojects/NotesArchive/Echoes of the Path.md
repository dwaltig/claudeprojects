# Echoes of the Path  
***by William Altig***  
  
Those who hear the Dharma’s call,  
not by chance, but grace of all,  
have walked beneath a thousand skies,  
with Buddhas’ light in ancient eyes.  
  
In ages past, through dust and flame,  
they whispered truth, unknown by name.  
The Bodhisattva’s vow they made,  
to heal, to teach, to never fade.  
  
Now in this world of fleeting sound,  
their lotus hearts again are found.  
Not newborn souls, but old and wise,  
with endless worlds behind their eyes.  
  
Their present faith, a blooming seed,  
from karma’s thread and noble deed—  
a stream that flows from distant heights,  
illuminating darkest nights.  
  
So if you feel this Sutra’s song  
has echoed in your soul all along,  
know this: you walk a path once trod,  
by countless lives in search of God.
