# Chasing Enlightenment  
  
[Verse]  
Walking down chaotic streets of time  
With dreams of wisdom ringing like a chime  
Buddha's light way up high in the sky  
Feels like I'll reach it by and by  
  
[Chorus]  
Enlightenment so high yet close enough to see  
Every step I take brings me a little more free  
The journey's tough full of curves and bends  
But every stumble's where the spirit mends  
  
[Verse 2]  
Sitting alone under that ancient tree  
The wisdom's echo singing inside of me  
Silent chants like whispers of the breeze  
Unlocking knots setting mind at ease  
  
[Chorus]  
Enlightenment so high yet close enough to see  
Every step I take brings me a little more free  
The journey's tough full of curves and bends  
But every stumble's where the spirit mends  
  
[Bridge]  
Through dark nights and blistering days  
Lost in the maze finding my own ways  
Every misstep a lesson in disguise  
Keep chasing the sun till morning rise  
  
[Verse 3]  
Eyes closed still searching within  
Through veils of doubt where hope begins  
Though the path twists it's all worthwhile  
In every tear hides the Buddha's smile
