[Verse 1]  
I walk with gods, both fierce and kind,  
Down a road where muses weave and wind.  
Their whispered songs, a mirrored grace,  
Voices call from some ancient place.  
  
[Chorus]  
Apollo’s light, Athena’s gaze,  
Aries’s fire, wrapped in haze—  
They walk beside me, hand in hand,  
Guiding steps through the shadowed land.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Not Greek alone, but Norse and East,  
Egypt’s gods join in the feast.  
Old truths and tales, they twist and bind,  
In songs reborn, a fate defined.  
  
[Chorus]  
Through mirrors bright, a shaman’s eye,  
Myth and meaning blend and rise.  
With every note, a truth retold,  
Of karma’s wheel and courage bold.  
  
[Bridge]  
And here I stand, a seeker’s heart,  
In worlds of rhythm, wisdom’s art.  
With Lotus light and Dharma’s way,  
I bridge the night, I birth the day.  
  
[Chorus]  
For all are one, each myth and lore,  
A single voice through mirrors soar.  
From past to now, the stories blend,  
Where gods and human paths extend.  
  
[Reprise Verse 2]  
Not Greek alone, but Norse and East,  
Egypt’s gods join in the feast.  
Old truths and tales, they twist and bind,  
In songs reborn, a fate defined.  
  
[RepriseVerse 2]  
Not Greek alone, but Norse and East,  
Egypt’s gods join in the feast.  
Old truths and tales, they twist and bind,  
In songs reborn, a fate defined.  
  
[Chorus]  
Through mirrors bright, a shaman’s eye,  
Myth and meaning blend and rise.  
With every note, a truth retold,  
Of karma’s wheel and courage bold.  
  
[Reprise Bridge]  
And here I stand, a seeker’s heart,  
In worlds of rhythm, wisdom’s art.  
With Lotus light and Dharma’s way,  
I bridge the night, I birth the day.  
  
[Chorus]  
Through mirrors bright, a shaman’s eye,  
Myth and meaning blend and rise.  
With every note, a truth retold,  
Of karma’s wheel and courage bold.  
  
[Reprise Bridge]  
And here I stand, a seeker’s heart,  
In worlds of rhythm, wisdom’s art.  
With Lotus light and Dharma’s way,  
I bridge the night, I birth the day.  
  
[Chorus]  
For all are one, each myth and lore,  
A single voice through mirrors soar.  
From past to now, the stories blend,  
Where gods and human paths extend.  
  
[Verse 3]  
So I sing, with heart and mind,  
Through deep mirrors, threads unwind.  
A bard, a shaman, friend to all,  
Answering every spirit’s call.  
  
[Outro]  
Yes, I walk with gods, both fierce and kind,  
Through halls of song, and realms divine.  
In every word, and every chord,  
Their voices lift—this soul restored.  
  
This soul restored.  
Restored
