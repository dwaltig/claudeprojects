(Verse 1)   
Woke up this mornin',   
sun shinin' on my face   
Heard a whisper on the wind,   
a message for the human race   
Said, "Open up your heart, let compassion be your guide   
We're all connected, intertwined, can't leave no one behind"  
  
(Chorus)   
Yeah, the world's a tapestry, threads of every hue Woven together, me and you   
From the mountains to the sea,   
one grand symphony   
Singin' a song of unity,   
eternally  
  
(Verse 2)   
Walked down the dusty road,   
met a stranger with a smile   
Shared stories of our journeys,   
for a little while   
Heard the laughter of children,   
playin' in the sun   
Felt the rhythm of the heartbeat, everyone as one  
  
(Chorus)   
Yeah,   
the world's a tapestry,   
threads of every hue   
Woven together,   
me and you   
From the mountains to the sea,   
one grand symphony   
Singin' a song of unity,   
eternally  
  
(Bridge)   
Ancient wisdom whispers, from the scriptures old and new   
The truth is always there, shinin' bright and true   
In every leaf and every stone, a spark of the divine   
A universal message, for all space and time  
  
(Chorus)   
Yeah,   
the world's a tapestry,   
threads of every hue   
Woven together,   
me and you   
From the mountains to the sea,   
one grand symphony   
Singin' a song of unity,   
eternally  
  
(Outro)   
So let your light shine brightly, let your love flow free   
Join the chorus of voices, singin' harmony   
Together we'll rise above, break the chains that bind   
And create a world of peace, for all humankind
