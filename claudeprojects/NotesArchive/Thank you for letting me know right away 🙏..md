  
**Thank you for letting me know right away **🙏**.**  
**I spoke with Lawrence this evening—the kids accidentally let Lily out, and he’s made it clear they could lose the dog if it happens again. He’s adding extra safeguards (gate locked, leash on before the door opens) so there’s no repeat.**  
  
**For peace of mind: Lily has never shown aggression toward people or other dogs, but we already know she can’t be trusted around smaller animals, so we’re not taking any chances. Your family’s safety is my top priority.**  
  
**If you ever feel uneasy or see Lily loose again, please call or text me immediately and I’ll handle it. Thanks for looking out for everyone’s safety. **🌟
