# The Auspicious Dawn of Wisdom  
*(A lyrical retelling of Great-Universal-Wisdom-Excellence Buddha’s Enlightenment)*  
  
Style:  
Folk Blues — contemplative but with deep soul and movement.  
(Mix of Leonard Cohen’s gravitas, Bob Dylan’s storytelling, and light gospel warmth.)  
  
Key:  
D Minor — evokes reverence and mystery, but leaves space for warmth and uplift as needed.  
  
Tempo:  
Slow to moderate (68–74 BPM) — allows for phrases to breathe and emotional weight to come through.  
  
Instruments:  
	•	Acoustic guitar (fingerpicked or soft strumming, slightly bluesy)  
	•	Light slide guitar or lap steel (for dreamy, spacious fills)  
	•	Upright bass or soft electric bass (to ground the space)  
	•	Harmonica (gentle, echoing on verses and bridging sections)  
	•	Optional: soft organ pad or background vocal hum (for choruses to add sacredness)  
  
[intro: Solo acoustic guitar + faint harmonica  
Fingerpick a descending blues scale to set a reverent, yearning mood.]  
  
[Verse 1 — In the Vastness of Time  
*Guitar + soft bass*  
Voice: Low, steady, storyteller tone  
Guitar: Simple chord progression, minor feel]  
  
Ten kalpas passed in silent grace,  
Still and deep in wisdom’s place.  
The Buddha sat, unmoved, serene,  
Awaiting dawn, yet still unseen.  
  
[Chorus — When Wisdom Breaks Through  
*Add harmonica + organ pad, background vocal harmony optional*  
Voice: Open up — almost hymn-like  
Guitar: Gentle strum  
Harmonica: Echo with rising notes]  
  
Then light arose, worlds shook and sang,  
The gates of dark to brightness rang.  
The heavens bloomed with flowers rare,  
Fragrant winds danced through holy air.  
  
[Verse 2 — The Celestial Offering  
*Drop organ, soft fingerpicking returns*  
Voice: Gentle, descriptive  
Harmonica: Sparse fills]  
  
Brahma-kings from realms on high,  
Cast blossoms falling from the sky.  
Not as rulers, but bowed and meek,  
Honoring truth they came to seek.  
  
[Bridge — Beyond Time and Space  
*Guitar + Slide guitar or Lap Steel enters*  
Voice: Introspective  
Slide guitar: Slow, gliding notes creating space]  
  
Hundred yojanas wide the glow,  
Through endless realms the blessings flow.  
Kalpas fade, and yet they feel,  
The Dharma’s pulse, profound and real.  
  
[Verse 3 — Gods Lay Down Their Crowns  
*Build slightly — bring back soft organ pad*  
Voice: Compassionate, tender  
Harmonica: subtle answers to vocal phrases]  
  
From countless worlds, the deities came,  
Leaving pleasures, whispering His name.  
Offerings made, attachments shed,  
For wisdom’s light they bowed their head.  
  
[Chorus — When Wisdom Breaks Through  
*Full ensemble — warm, like a gospel moment but still understated*  
Voice: Strong, inclusive  
Background vocals: (optional) “Oh wisdom dawned…”]  
  
Then light arose, worlds shook and sang,  
The gates of dark to brightness rang.  
The heavens bloomed with flowers rare,  
Fragrant winds danced through holy air.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[Verse 4 — Beyond the Phantom City  
*Return to soft guitar and slide — intimate, quiet*  
Voice: Reflective, poetic]  
  
Illusions fall like withered leaves,  
The treasure land no longer deceives.  
The phantom fades, yet is not gone,  
For all along, it led us on.  
  
[Verse 5 — The Universal Call  
*Slight build again — bring organ pad and harmonica gently*  
Voice: Hopeful, declarative]  
  
The sixteen sons, with voices clear,  
Urged the Buddha for all to hear.  
The Lotus blooms in every age,  
Across the worlds, from sage to sage.  
  
[Final Chorus — The Eternal Song  
*Fullest part — uplifting, slow gospel-folk anthem feel*  
Voice: Open and resonant  
Background vocals: “Sing the Sutra eternally”]  
  
Oh, wisdom dawned, and worlds awoke,  
The cosmic dream, the veil broke.  
Buddhas past and yet to be,  
Sing the Sutra eternally.  
  
*[Outro — soft, reflective*  
*Return to solo acoustic guitar + faint harmonica*  
Voice: Whispered or lightly sung  
Harmonica: Long, fading note]  
  
So too, within our hearts today,  
The flowers fall and drift away.  
Yet fragrant winds remind us still,  
The Buddha’s vow, the Dharma’s will.
