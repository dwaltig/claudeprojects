# We will get through this.  
# Our conditions are inconvenient, I agree. I don’t mind the inconvenience when I know that I’m helping save another persons health. We may be trapped at home, but we don’t need to create the conditions of hell and fear in her lives.￼￼ We can remember better days and, we can look forward to better days to come￼.   
For the past several years I’ve had a consistent practice of two hours a day. When this crisis started, I upped it to three hours a day so that I pray we elevate our lives to that of Buddhahood, so we can save others.￼
