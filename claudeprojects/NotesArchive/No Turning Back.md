# No Turning Back  
  
Verse 1  
I walked through shadows, I walked through flame,  
Chasing false treasures, calling their name.  
But the Dharma caught me, lit up the track,  
Now I know there’s no turning back.  
  
Chorus  
No turning back, no falling away,  
The vow I made still stands today.  
Joy in the struggle, strength in the lack,  
I found my freedom—no turning back.  
no turning back,   
no turning back,   
no turning back.  
  
Verse 2  
The house is burning, but I won’t run blind,  
The Buddha’s teaching clears my mind.  
A single vehicle, wide and true,  
Carries me forward, carries me through.  
  
Chorus  
No turning back, no falling away,  
The vow I made still stands today.  
Joy in the struggle, strength in the lack,  
I found my freedom—no turning back.  
no turning back,   
no turning back,   
no turning back.  
  
Verse 3  
From joy to joy, I walk this road,  
Shouldering suffering, bearing the load.  
Bodhisattvas rise from the earth so black,  
To show the world—there’s no turning back.  
  
Bridge  
Even Devadatta, even the foe,  
Carry the seed that’s bound to grow.  
The Dragon’s daughter breaks the chain,  
Proving the promise will not wane.  
  
Final Chorus  
No turning back, no falling away,  
The vow we made still stands today.  
Joy in the struggle, strength in the lack,  
I found my freedom—no turning back.  
no turning back,   
no turning back,   
no turning back.
