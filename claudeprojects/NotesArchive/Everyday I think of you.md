Everyday I think of you:  
  
"He was patient, gentle,   
And friendly with others.   
Even when many evils troubled him,   
His mind was not moved."  
  
The Buddha sung these verses in Chapter Seventeen of the Lotus Sūtra. This stanza was his description of the Bodhisattva Perfection of Patience. As with all the perfections, these are qualities we cultivate, rather than something to use to judge how close we or anybody else is to enlightenment. As we progress in these perfections, our view of the world is less obscured by our own mental formations. We begin to see the world for what it is, and each other for what we are. I'm  
Lucky to  know you. 🔆🙏💛
