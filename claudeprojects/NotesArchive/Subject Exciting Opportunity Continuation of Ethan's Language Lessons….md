I hope you're doing fantastic! I wanted to update you on an important change concerning Ethan's language program. Due to a recent modification in his contract with CARTUS, his new end date has been set as April 29th, 2023, which means they will no longer participate in his lessons. But rest assured. There's absolutely no reason to worry!
