[Intro]  
Verse 1:  
Yo, check the mic, one two, Lotus in my crew,  
Sutra wisdom flowin', makin' all things new.  
Six Perfections, pillars strong and true,  
Charity, morality, dedication through and through.  
  
Open hand, lend an ear, spreadin' love and cheer,  
Ethical livin', yo, that's my career.  
Patience in the struggle, ain't no room for fear,  
Energy unleashed, burnin' bright, it's clear.  
  
Chorus:  
Lotus flow, breakin' through the dirt,  
Virtues takin' root, puttin' in the work.  
Bodhisattva spirit, aimin' for the top,  
Compassion overflowin', never gonna stop.  
Enlightenment's the mission, watch my spirit pop.  
  
Verse 2:  
Meditation sessions, clearin' out the mind,  
Ignorance faded, truth I'm here to find.  
Loving-kindness vibin', compassion in my soul,  
Forbearance through the struggle, makin' me whole.  
  
Thoughts pure, actions clean, no doubt in my stride,  
Vigor in my step, nowhere left to hide.  
Humility's the key, ego gotta go,  
Faith in Buddha's teachings, watch my wisdom grow.  
  
Chorus:  
Lotus flow, breakin' through the dirt,  
Virtues takin' root, puttin' in the work.  
Bodhisattva spirit, aimin' for the top,  
Compassion overflowin', never gonna stop.  
Enlightenment's the mission, watch my spirit pop.  
  
Bridge:  
Simple livin', no need for the bling,  
Each action's a seed, watch the Dharma spring.  
Skillful means adaptin', to whatever the scene,  
Buddha nature universal, yo, we all one team.  
  
Verse 3:  
Virtues intertwined, like a golden chain,  
Patience fuels compassion, easin' all the pain.  
Wisdom deepens faith, guidin' every day,  
One Vehicle ridin', lightin' up the way.  
  
Step by step we climbin', transformin' through the fire,  
Sutra's got my back, takin' me higher.  
From the mud we risin', petals open wide,  
Liberation's callin', with the Sutra as my guide.  
  
Chorus:  
Lotus flow, breakin' through the dirt,  
Virtues takin' root, puttin' in the work.  
Bodhisattva spirit, aimin' for the top,  
Compassion overflowin', never gonna stop.  
Enlightenment's the mission, watch my spirit pop.  
  
Outro:  
Teachings like a beacon, shinin' through the night,  
Cultivate the virtues, step into the light.  
Lotus Sutra wisdom, in every single rhyme,  
Enlightenment's the journey, takin' it one step at a time.
