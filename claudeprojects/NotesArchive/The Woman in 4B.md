# The Woman in 4B  
## *A Blues Folk Ballad*  
  
Three voices, one family breaking apart. A mysterious neighbor with an open door and endless tea. A blues-folk story about the three poisons we carry—greed, anger, and numbness—and the unexpected way we learn to set them down. Told through the eyes of a daughter scrolling her pain away, a son burning with rage, and a mother who's forgotten how to feel. Sometimes the person who saves you is just a mirror showing you who you already are.  
  
Inspired by Buddhist parables and modern urban loneliness. Pour yourself some tea and listen.

Lyrics:   
**Verse 1**   
There's a rooster in my chest, won't let me rest,   
Peckin' all night long, sayin' *more, more, more*   
There's a snake wrapped 'round my son's young heart,   
Spittin' poison through a bedroom door   
And mama's gone to somewhere we can't reach,   
Like a pig with its eyes rolled back   
We're three people eatin' dinner in silence,   
Each one walkin' a different track  
  
**Chorus**   
But there's a light on in apartment 4B,   
Door standin' open wide   
Kettle singin' on the stove,   
And an old woman waitin' inside   
She says, *"Child, come in from the rain, *  
*Let me show you somethin' true— *  
*The one you're lookin' for to save you, *  
*Baby, that's already you"*  
  
**Verse 2**   
She was ancient as the hills, that Mrs. Chen,   
With a face like a walnut tree   
And she had this way of knowin'   
What was eatin' you and me   
She'd say, *"Girl, you tryin' to hold water in your fists? *  
*Boy, those coals are burnin' your hands. *  
*Mama, you can't hide from your own heartbeat— *  
*That ain't livin', that's just sand"*  
  
**Chorus**   
There's a light on in apartment 4B,   
Tea cups on the table set She says,   
*"Don't pray to me, just breathe with me, *  
*Imagine who you haven't met— *  
*The you that don't need what you ain't got, *  
*The you that don't need to fight, *  
*The you that ain't afraid to feel— *  
*Baby, that's your birthright"*  
  
**Verse 3**   
She told my girl, *"When the wantin' starts to claw, *  
*Picture someone satisfied *  
*Not 'cause they got everything, *  
*But 'cause they got nothin' to hide"*   
She told my boy, *"When the hatred starts to burn, *  
*Try to see through their eyes— *  
*Hurt people hurt people, son, *  
*That ain't judgment, that's just life"*  
  
**Bridge**   
And she sat with me, Lord, she sat with me,   
While I cried for the first time in a year   
She said, *"You think you're separate from your pain, *  
*But that's the lie, my dear *  
*When you numb yourself from sufferin', *  
*You numb yourself from joy— *  
*The door's been locked from the inside, *  
*And you're the one with the key, boy"*  
  
**Verse 4**   
Six months passed like morning rain,   
Somethin' shifted in our home   
My daughter put her phone down smilin',   
My son stopped throwin' stones   
I picked up a paintbrush, my hands rememberin',   
What it felt like to be whole   
We'd sit in 4B every Tuesday,   
Drinkin' tea and feedin' our souls  
  
**Chorus**   
Yeah, there's a light on in apartment 4B,   
We're laughin' like we're free   
She says, *"See? The jewel was in the lotus, *  
*You just couldn't see *  
*The mud don't hide your nature, *  
*It's where the lotus grows— *  
*Your greed, your rage, your blindness, *  
*That's the only path home"*  
  
**Verse 5**   
Then one Tuesday the door was empty,   
Just a kettle and a note It said,   
*"The door was always yours, my loves, *  
*I just held it while you learned to float *  
*Keep it open, keep it brewin', *  
*Someone else will need a light— *  
*I wasn't up there savin' you, *  
*I was just your mirror shinin' bright"*  
  
**Breakdown/Spoken Word over soft guitar**   
*And we understood then,*   
*Sittin' in that empty room,*   
*She was never someone else—*   
*She was just what we could become*   
*When we stopped pretendin'*   
*We were separate from the pain,*   
*Separate from each other,*   
*Separate from the rain*  
  
**Final Verse**   
Now we live in 4B, keepin' that door wide,   
Kettle singin' all day long   
When the angry boy walks past, my son says, *"Hey, I know that song"*   
When the woman with the vacant eyes comes by,   
I hand her a brush and say, *"Paint"*   
When the girl can't stop scrollin', my daughter smiles,   
Says, *"I used to be you, ain't that quaint?"*  
  
**Final Chorus**   
Now there's a light on in apartment 4B,   
And it ain't goin' out tonight   
We ain't waitin' for some savior,   
We became the light   
She said, *"The Bodhisattva ain't someone else, *  
*It's who you are when you can see— *  
*We're all just water from the same well, *  
*All just waves on the same sea"*  
  
**Outro** *(slow, repeated)*   
The rooster's gettin' quiet now... *(the rooster's gettin' quiet)*   
The snake is lettin' go... *(the snake is lettin' go)*   
The pig has opened up its eyes... *(opened up its eyes)*   
And Lord, now we know... *(Lord, now we know)*  
The door was always open,   
The tea was always brewin',   
The jewel was in the lotus,   
And the lotus... was you.  
*(Harmonica fades out)*
