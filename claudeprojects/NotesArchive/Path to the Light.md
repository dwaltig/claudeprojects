(Verse 1)  
World's gone astray, lost its way,  
But a wise one's here to stay,  
Searched so long, truth unseen,  
But the light in his heart, ever keen.  
  
(Chorus)  
(Soft, soulful vocals with gentle acoustic guitar)  
Guide us through the darkest night,  
Lead us to the morning light,  
Show us where the shadows cease,  
Where love and hope find release.  
  
(Verse 2)  
Angels gather, shining bright,  
Blessing this holy sight,  
Music fills the air so sweet,  
As the wise one takes his seat.  
  
(Chorus)  
(Slightly more upbeat, with light percussion and maybe a harmonica)  
Guide us through the darkest night,  
Lead us to the morning light,  
Show us where the shadows cease,  
Where love and hope find release.  
  
(Verse 3)  
Voices rise, a yearning plea,  
"Show us the truth, set us free,"  
But the wise one takes his time,  
Peace and wisdom in each line.  
  
(Chorus)  
(Building in intensity, with layered vocals and a more prominent bass line)  
Guide us through the darkest night,  
Lead us to the morning light,  
Show us where the shadows cease,  
Where love and hope find release.  
  
(Verse 4)  
Through the doubt, through the fear,  
He guides us, year after year,  
Love shines bright, chasing away the night,  
Leading us to what's true and right.  
  
(Chorus)  
(Full, passionate vocals with all instruments joining in)  
Guide us through the darkest night,  
Lead us to the morning light,  
Show us where the shadows cease,  
Where love and hope find release.  
  
(Outro)  
(Fade out with gentle acoustic guitar and humming)  
We'll walk as one, hand in hand,  
Towards the light, in this promised land,  
With open hearts and spirits free,  
On the path to eternity.
