*Seeing these wonders displayed by the supernatural powers of his sons, the father had the greatest joy that he had ever had. He joined his hands together towards his sons staying in the sky, and said, ‘Who is your teacher? Whose disciples are you?’*

King Wonderful-Adornment makes this declaration to his sons in Chapter Twenty-Seven of the Lotus Sūtra. His sons had been asked by their mother to display their supernatural powers to their father and awaken the desire in him to hear the Buddha Dharma. We all have abilities of which we are not aware, and can cultivate those abilities so that they may seem miraculous to those who do not understand them. But it is important for us not to fall in the trap of using these abilities to strengthen our ego delusion. Instead we should dedicate our talents towards awakening the joy of the Wonderful Dharma in all beings.

This passage from the Lotus Sūtra presents a rich scene for a storyboard panel, blending elements of wonder, revelation, and spiritual teaching. Here are some creative suggestions to bring this scene to life in your storyboard:  
  
1. **Setting and Perspective**: Given the celestial nature of the scene, consider an upward-looking perspective. This will allow you to depict the father on the ground and the sons aloft in the sky. The background can be ethereal, possibly with soft clouds or a hint of a celestial realm to emphasize the supernatural aspect.  
  
2. **Character Expressions and Poses**:  
   - **The Father (King Wonderful-Adornment)**: His expression should be one of awe and humility. His pose with joined hands suggests respect and reverence. His gaze should be directed upwards towards his sons.  
   - **The Sons**: Positioned in the sky, their posture should convey a sense of calm power and grace. Their faces might reflect a serene confidence, knowing the impact of their display.  
  
3. **Color and Light**: Use light to create a sense of divinity. Soft, glowing light around the sons can symbolize their supernatural powers. The overall color palette could be serene and otherworldly, with pastel hues to convey a sense of peace and spiritual upliftment.  
  
4. **Symbolic Elements**: You might want to include symbolic elements that resonate with the teachings of the Lotus Sūtra. This could be a subtle lotus motif in the background or a gentle aura around the characters.  
  
5. **Narrative Technique**: To convey the teaching about using abilities not to strengthen ego but to awaken joy in others, consider adding a visual metaphor. For example, the light emanating from the sons could gently touch the father and the surrounding area, symbolizing the awakening of joy and understanding.  
  
6. **Panel Layout**: Since this is a moment of revelation, it might deserve a larger or more prominent panel in your storyboard. This emphasizes the importance of the scene within the narrative.  
  
Remember, your storyboard should not only depict the scene visually but also convey the underlying message and emotions. This scene is about revelation, humility, and the awe-inspiring nature of spiritual awakening, so your illustrations should reflect these themes.
