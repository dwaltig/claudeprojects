"Frankly speaking, it's clear that the world doesn't need religion anymore." - Japan's New Religions (including Soka Gakkai) and COVID-19  
  
This is GREAT fun!  Note: It's autotranslated, so there are some grammatical oddities.  Where possible, I've clarified to the best of my (limited) ability:  
  
> Contrasting infection control between Soka Gakkai and the science of happiness "Immune is raised by law"  
  
>Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo. Needless to say, it is the headquarters of Japan's largest new religious movement, Soka Gakkai. It is a sacred place of Soka Gakkai, which is crowded with many academic members on weekends, but on a holiday in late March, the town was completely quiet. Headquarters facilities such as Kosen-rufu Daisho-do have closed the entrance tightly, and no one is walking.  
  
>The unpopular Soka Gakkai headquarters in Shinanomachi, Tokyo. If you want to take a picture of the headquarters in normal times, you may be asked by the guards [*confronted by the guards and asked what you think you're doing*], but in [*this time of*] Corona[*virus*], you can take as many pictures as you want from the public road.  
  
>That should be the case, on February 17, Soka Gakkai decided on various policies such as closing the headquarters facility and canceling cult events as measures to prevent infection with the new coronavirus. He [*Soka Gakkai*] called for the cancellation of a small gathering held by local Soka Gakkai members, called a "round-table discussion [*discussion meetings*]," and has been virtually suspended until now. The giant sect with a nominal membership of 8.27 million households is **now completely stalled** in the face of unknown pathogens.  
  
*Forget* about "shakubuku"!  
  
>It's not just Soka Gakkai. From February to March, major new religious movements in Japan, such as Rissho Koseikai, Shinnyo-en, Seicho-no-Ie, and Church of World Messianity, announced the closure of cult facilities and the cancellation of sponsored events. As of late March, the reality is that few cults are doing "normal" activities. [Source](https://president.jp/articles/-/34141)  
  
>A mid-career executive at Soka Gakkai says with a firm expression. It was in late February that South Korea's new religious movement, Shincheonji Jesus Church, was criticized for spreading the infection of the new coronavirus during a cult event and triggering an outbreak in South Korea. Lee Man-hee, a guru who has been called "Christ of the Rebirth," was forced to apologize to Dogeza on March 2 in front of the media.  
  
How *embarrassing!*  
  
#General believer "Well, if you believe it, it should protect you from illness ..."  
  
That is a commonplace belief - if "karma" determines one's susceptibility to illness (or fates one to become ill), and "correct belief/practice" enables one to *change one's karma*, then *clearly*, one can *determine* whether one will be affected by coronavirus!  
  
When people *do* contract a COVID infection, well, that's their "karma" and/or they just didn't *chant enough* - amirite? [There *are* no coincidences](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/46s4eg/there_are_no_coincidences/) O_O  
  
>"The events of religious groups are almost everywhere, **where many believers gather at cult facilities and pray together by chanting sutras**. Three dense (sealed, closed), which is a condition for the occurrence of clusters (groups of infected people). If there is a cluster from a religious event under the current social situation, it will be criticized by the public and will be involved in the survival of the cult. I don't think there are many groups that have the courage. "(Same as above)  
  
Of course the cults want their frenetic in-person meeting schedules to continue unabated. BUT if they *do* - and a large outbreak of infection is linked to their silly "activities", there will be HUGE negative press, societal backlash, etc. Like we've seen in the USA with [Christians' stupid rockheaded insistence on having/attending their dumb Christian "worship services"](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/indoor-church-services-are-covid-19-hot-spots-heres-why).  
  
>Indeed, the judgments of each cult leadership certainly seem to be valid. However, on the other hand, it is also true that the general believers are quietly saying, "I'm not surprised at anything."  
  
>**For example, during the period of rapid expansion after the war, Soka Gakkai was actively advocating the phrase "liberation from poverty, illness, and conflict."**  
  
[They certainly were.  And SGI *continues* to promote belief in "faith-healing".](https://www.reddit.com/r/ExSGISurviveThrive/comments/alm8bq/faith_healing_cancer_hostility_toward_science_and/)  Just like the worst snake-handling-est weirdo fringe sect of Christianity.  THAT's the company SGI members are in.  
  
>Rissho Koseikai founder Nikkyo Niwano and Shinnyo-en founder Shinjo Ito have psychic allies named Myoko Naganuma and Tomoji Ito, respectively, and use their "mysterious power" to cure the illness of believers and gain power. I[*They*] have expanded it. In addition, Seicho-no-Ie founder Masaharu Taniguchi was a person whose deciding phrase was "a child of a human god, originally no illness", and Mokichi Okada, the lord of the Church of World Messianity, holds his palm over another person. It is the ancestor of the "new religion of the hand-held system" that can cure the disease. In other words, many of them **have a history of developing and expanding with "disease cure" as a signboard, to a greater or lesser extent than Japanese new religious movements.**  
  
>Rissho Koseikai officials "Cancellation of events, **honesty is difficult**"  
  
Always, when it's a **CULT**.  
  
>An old member of a Seicho-no-Ie says:  
  
"The policy of canceling various events is medically correct because it does not create clusters from the cult, and I have no intention of objecting to it. However, at present, all groups say," Government and experts refrain from activities. It is also true that we cannot see any more attitude than saying, "I will obey because I ask for it." This makes me feel that what the religion is for and what we have believed in. "  
  
>**It has also been pointed out that prolonged self-restraint could have a serious impact on the finances of each sect.** This is because many new religious movements in Japan have the fact that the amount of membership fees they pay on a regular basis is not that high. For example, the membership fee for Rissho Koseikai is 100 yen a month. Shinnyo-en is 200 yen a month. Soka Gakkai does not have the concept of membership fees in the first place.  
  
Duh *herr* duh *herr* *Riiiight*.  SGI's just *that* dishonest. Let's just forget about the cost of the nohonzon; the publications and subscriptions that are routinely flogged at the membership; the donations envelopes at the tables by the exits after all the activities held at their centers; and what about **[ZAIMU](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/8msm5l/sgis_annual_may_contribution_campaign_its_not_too/)**??  
  
>"I think it's similar for other cults, but in many cases, when you visit a big event, headquarters, church, etc., you get a donation that is different from the membership fee. However, **that is one of the important pillars, and if the self-restraint of activities is prolonged too much, it will definitely be bad.** " [Source](https://president.jp/articles/-/34141?page=2)  
  
Not *only* will the *normal* religions suffer from the drop in donations that are easier to squeeze out of the devout during frequent in-person worship services/activities, but *that's* how they keep 'em on the hook!  Keep 'em busy! Keep 'em engaged! If they have too much free time on their hands, they're going to find *something ELSE* to do with themselves, and they'll likely realize they like that BETTER!  It's a *disaster*...  
  
>Ultra C, the science of happiness, **"listening to the law and boosting immunity"**  
  
*Chant* yourself immune!  
  
>However, while many cults are forced to "fight against self-restraint" against the new coronavirus, the science of happiness is the momentum to vomit. As of the end of March, even if you look at the official website of the cult, "Notice of self-restraint" is not posted, and on the contrary, the latest ceremonies and seminars are updated daily. It seems that the cult leader, Ryuho Okawa, is also continuing to talk about the law to his followers, and even the words "listening to the law raises immunity" are jumping on the cult-related news site "The Liberty web."  
  
They're *desperate* to get the faithful together for the group indoctrination and conditioning sessions, in other words.  
  
>"I don't envy you, and I don't want you to imitate it, but I think that the cult where the founding owner (Governor Okawa) is still alive has momentum in many ways." (Old member of the house)  
  
Notice how the Soka Gakkai and SGI have [made such a big hairy deal](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/av25hn/sgi_has_taken_great_pride_in_having_a_living/) about having a "[living mentor](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/bctiwc/all_that_focus_on_a_living_mentor_as_if_the/)". What about when they *finally HAVE to admit* Ikeda is **[DEAD](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/f18187/daisaku_ikeda_is_dead/)**?? Will Scamsei *rise from the dead* to live in everyone's hearts as a perpetually comforting spirit of something or other??  
  
#Soka Gakkai believer "The world no longer needs religion"  
  
>According to The Liberty web, more than 1,000 members packed into the talks of President Okawa in late February and mid-March. "From a third-party perspective, it's natural to think that it's okay" (same as above), but what will happen in the future?  
  
>However, **regarding the very "future" of Japan's new religion as a whole, a third-generation member of Soka Gakkai said, "I am a person who just joined because my grandfather and parents were academic members."** Say this.  
  
So this person is saying, "I just joined to keep peace in the family - I don't give a single wet runny SHIT about Soka Gakkai, but I'll go ahead and join because otherwise it will cause problems within my family." That's pretty commonplace, but it's not a *growth* strategy or even a *survival* strategy for SGI.  
  
>**"In the old days when medicine was underdeveloped, I think there was a history of people clinging to religion and encouraging them to cure illness, but nowadays, at least in developed countries, illness. There is no point in relying on religion for those who have become ill. The situation in which many religious groups have just stopped working as a countermeasure against the new corona virus will definitely have a great impact on the existence value of religion itself. Frankly speaking, it's clear that the world doesn't need religion anymore. "**  
  
I must agree.  "Faith-healing" is a HUGE selling point for most of the hate-filled, intolerant religions - reflecting the reality that they're *selling* to desperate people - but most people nowadays know better.  Religion *doesn't* cure people.  If it *did*, we'd all see (that pesky ol' "actual proof" problem) - they'd live *longer*, healthier lives; recover from illnesses *faster* and *more completely*; have lower *rates* of illnesses; and avoid more illnesses/injuries altogether.  [And we can easily see they DON'T.](https://www.reddit.com/r/sgiwhistleblowers/comments/l049bz/toda_repeatedly_claimed_his_cirrhosis_of_the/gju7fwv/)
