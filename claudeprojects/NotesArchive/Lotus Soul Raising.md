Verse 1 (Blues Style):  
In a world of thunder and weary rains,  
I’ve walked through shadows, felt the aching strains.  
Yet in the quiet of the midnight, whispers softly call—  
An ancient promise, “You’re never alone at all.”  
  
Pre-Chorus (Folk Touch):  
Through the wind and the rain, there’s a melody,  
Of hope and rebirth in every memory.  
  
Chorus (Universal Anthem):  
Let the lotus bloom within, let your spirit be free,  
From the blues of the struggle, find your light—find your key.  
Turn each sorrow into power, let every scar be healed,  
In the song of life’s unfolding, may your inner truth be revealed.  
  
Verse 2 (Folk Narrative):  
In ballads of old, where time meets the soul,  
I hear voices whisper of resilience, making us whole.  
Every tear writes a story, every heartache sings a tune,  
Reminding us that even in darkness, a new dawn comes soon.  
  
Pre-Bridge (Building Momentum):  
Now, as the present meets the past in every beat,  
We merge the timeless with the modern, where heart and spirit meet.  
  
Bridge (Rap Section):  
Yo, in this digital era, where hustle shapes the day,  
We’re flipping ancient wisdom into verses that pave the way.  
From pain to power, from struggle to art,  
Every broken piece of life is a canvas for the heart.  
Listen, each step we take is a move against the chain—  
We rise like a lotus, defying every strain.  
The echoes of the Sutra, now amplified in modern flow,  
Turn the scars into symbols and let the inner light glow.  
  
Chorus (Universal Anthem):  
Let the lotus bloom within, let your spirit be free,  
From the blues of the struggle, find your light—find your key.  
Turn each sorrow into power, let every scar be healed,  
In the song of life’s unfolding, may your inner truth be revealed.  
  
Outro (Fusion of Blues & Folk):  
In the fusion of our stories, where ancient echoes sing,  
We ignite the flame of transformation—let the new day begin.  
With every note, a promise; with every chord, a spark—  
Illuminating our journeys, lighting fires in the dark.
