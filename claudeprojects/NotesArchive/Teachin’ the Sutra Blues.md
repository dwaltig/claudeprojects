(Verse 1)    
He who teaches, this holy sutra's name,    
Gonna walk with wisdom, gonna light the flame.    
Words of Dharma rollin' off his tongue,    
Eloquence and grace, his song's begun.  
  
(Chorus)    
Oh, the Buddhas, they’re watchin' from above,    
Guidin' every step with their boundless love.    
Teachin' the sutra, spreadin’ the light,    
Gonna shine like the sun in the darkest night.  
  
(Verse 2)    
Voices in the wind, singin’ clear and true,    
Spreadin' the truth, like the morning dew.    
With a radiant aura, he’ll light up the way,    
Bringing peace and hope to a brand-new day.  
  
(Chorus)    
Oh, the Buddhas, they’re watchin' from above,    
Guidin' every step with their boundless love.    
Teachin' the sutra, spreadin’ the light,    
Gonna shine like the sun in the darkest night.  
Gonna shine like the sun in the darkest night.  
  
(Bridge)    
From the depths of the heart, to the edge of the sea,    
The Dharma flows, setting souls free.    
With compassion so deep, wisdom so wide,    
He’ll walk with the Buddha right by his side.  
  
(Chorus)    
Oh, the Buddhas, they’re watchin' from above,    
Guidin' every step with their boundless love.    
Teachin' the sutra, spreadin’ the light,    
Gonna shine like the sun in the darkest night.  
  
(Outro)    
So teach this sutra, let your voice ring,    
And feel the joy that true Dharma brings.    
In the heart of the blues, find the truth so pure,    
In every note, the Buddha’s love will endure.
