The Eye and Heart once fell to fight,  
Each claiming what they thought was right.  
Said Eye, “Their beauty I behold,  
Their every feature, bright and bold.  
  
Without my gaze, you’d never know  
The grace and form that make them glow.”  
The Heart replied, “But what I keep  
Goes far beyond what eyes can reap.  
  
For in my depths, their love resides,  
A hidden truth your view denies.”  
They quarreled on, both firm, intense,  
Until the Thoughts were called for sense.  
  
The Thoughts decreed, with voices clear,  
“Each holds a part that’s just as dear.  
The Eye may claim their outer frame,  
While Heart can hold the love’s true flame.”  
  
And so, in balance, they would stay,  
To cherish all in their own way.  
For only joined could they unite  
The soul within, the form in sight.
