[Intro]  
  
Verse 1  
Sun beatin' down, dust in my eyes  
Mirage shimmerin', a city in disguise  
Legs achin', heart full of woes  
Seekin' shelter, where weary souls repose  
  
Chorus:  
Magic City, mirage of light   
Tempts the weary, shines so bright   
But wisdom whispers, "Journey on"   
True enlightenment's not yet won  
  
Verse 2  
Towers so tall, gardens so green  
Laughter and music, a joyful scene  
But wise old guide, he knows the score  
This ain't no heaven, just a painted door  
  
Chorus:  
Magic City, mirage of light   
Tempts the weary, shines so bright   
But wisdom whispers, "Journey on"   
True enlightenment's not yet won  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
**Bridge**  
Rest your bones, catch your breath  
But don't get fooled, this ain't your death  
Real treasure lies on the road ahead  
Where faith and courage will be your bread  
  
Chorus:  
Magic City, mirage of light   
Tempts the weary, shines so bright   
But wisdom whispers, "Journey on"   
True enlightenment's not yet won  
  
Verse 3  
So we rise up, dust off our boots  
Leave the mirage, follow the roots  
Onward we march, hearts full of fire  
Seekin' truth, that's our desire  
  
Chorus:  
Magic City, mirage of light   
Tempts the weary, shines so bright   
But wisdom whispers, "Journey on"   
True enlightenment's not yet won  
  
[End]
