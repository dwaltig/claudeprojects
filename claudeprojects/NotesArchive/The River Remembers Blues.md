Lyrics:   
Intro (Spoken or sung softly)  
Oh, the river...    
It’s been still, it’s been silent,    
But the river remembers, yeah, it knows its way.    
  
 Verse 1  
I was a whisper in the mountain’s heart,    
Oh yeah, I was just a seed.    
(A whisper in the mountain’s heart...)    
Forgotten and quiet, but I was always meant to be freed.    
(Oh, I was always meant to be freed...)    
  
 Chorus (Refrain)  
Oh, the river remembers, yeah, the river knows,    
Through the stone, through the silence, it flows and flows.    
When the rains come down, and the waters rise,    
The river sings, oh, the river flies!    
  
 Verse 2  
I wandered through the lifetimes, baby,    
Through the rock and through the dirt.    
(Wandered through the lifetimes, baby...)    
Through the seasons of silence, oh, I’ve known the hurt.    
(Oh, I’ve known the hurt...)    
  
But now the rain is fallin’, and I feel the ground shake,    
I’ve been gatherin’ my strength, now it’s time to awake.    
  
 Chorus (Refrain)  
Oh, the river remembers, yeah, the river knows,    
Through the stone, through the silence, it flows and flows.    
When the rains come down, and the waters rise,    
The river sings, oh, the river flies!    
  
 Verse 3  
I carved the canyon, baby, where I used to crawl,    
(Oh, I carved the canyon, baby...)    
I danced through the valleys, oh, I answered the call.    
(Oh, I answered the call...)    
  
They said, “Where’d this flood come from?”    
“How’d it break so free?”    
But the river just smiled, said, “I’ve always been me.”    
  
 Bridge (Build momentum)  
Through a thousand lifetimes, yeah, I’ve been on this road,    
Through the lessons, through the silence, I carried the load.    
Oh, when the flood of knowing comes, don’t you fight the tide,    
You’re the river now, baby, just let it ride!    
  
 Final Chorus (Refrain - Big and soulful)  
Oh, the river remembers, yeah, the river knows,    
Through the stone, through the silence, it flows and flows.    
When the rains come down, and the waters rise,    
The river sings, oh, the river flies!    
  
Outro (Spoken or sung softly, fading out)  
Oh, the river...    
Always been on its way.    
Always been on its way...
