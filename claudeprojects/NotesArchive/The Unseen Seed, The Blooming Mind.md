# The Unseen Seed, The Blooming Mind  
#   
A foreign tongue, a chanted sound,   
No English meaning, clearly found.   
Is wisdom lost, or truth concealed,   
When ancient verses are revealed?   
You ask, "Is that so wise, this way,   
To speak what foreign words convey?"  
  
Nay, for the Mystic Law profound,   
In Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is found   
The heart and core of all the sutra's might,   
Its essence pure, its Daimoku bright.   
The blessings flow, though words unknown,   
For **faith's the seed that's deeply sown**.   
No need for knowledge, sharp and deep,   
While in the Mystic Law we leap.  
  
The Sutra whispers, "**Miracles unfold**,"   
A truth far grander than can be told.   
For "voices do the Buddha's work,"   
Through every chanted sound and quirk.   
Benefits arise, no mind can halt,   
Like baby nourished, without knowing salt.   
Expedient Means, and Life Span's vow,   
Are chanted here, and here and now.  
  
Yet understanding, too, shall grow,   
A deeper wisdom starts to flow.   
Not just by intellect's keen sight,   
But from within, a subtle light.   
For written words, the Buddha's thought,   
Beyond mere language, wisely wrought.   
The Lotus Sutra, hard to grasp,   
A wisdom Buddhas only clasp.   
But faith becomes the very key,   
To Buddha wisdom, for all to see.  
  
It's "**knowledge without faith**" that fails,   
While "**faith without knowledge**" often prevails.   
Our senses change, a wondrous state,   
The mind's own faculty elevate.   
A single verse, its meaning clear,   
When practiced with a heart sincere.   
Extraordinary qualities accrue,   
A fragrant wisdom, fresh and new.  
  
For study, too, Nichiren decreed,   
A vital, necessary deed.   
To understand the sacred text,   
By translations, meanings often vexed.   
Through guidance of an enlightened sage,   
We delve deeper, turning life's page.   
This Mystic Law, for all mankind,   
**Buddha nature**, we shall find.  
  
So miracles, by faith unfold,   
A story ceaselessly retold.   
And understanding, by its grace,   
Fills every heart, transforms all space.   
From chanted sound, to inner light,   
The Lotus blooms, forever bright.
