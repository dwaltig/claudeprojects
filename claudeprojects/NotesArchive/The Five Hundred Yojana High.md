# The Five Hundred Yojana High  
  
*A Dharma Blues in Gold and Dust*  
  
**(Verse 1 — The Tremor)**  
The ground was a prayer, cold and bare,  
My knees hummed songs the bones could barely bear.  
Dust hung heavy, incense in my chest,  
The mountain moaned beneath its breath.  
The Lord grew silent—fire beneath the clay  
Then the whole wide earth whispered my name.  
  
**(Chorus — The Tower Appears)**  
Oh that tower rose, five hundred yojana high,  
Gold and lapis bleeding into the sky.  
Sandalwood wind filled my lungs with fire,  
And a voice rolled deep from a jeweled spire:  
*“Excellent! Excellent! Śākyamuni!”*  
Now the truth ain’t far — it’s rising in me.  
  
⸻  
  
**(Verse 2 — The Radiance)**  
Emerald rivers ran down my skin,  
Pearls in the air, where the breath had been.  
White cloths wheeled like doves on the wing,  
And coral banners cracked — you could hear them sing.  
The heavens rained blossoms, cool and kind,  
Each petal burned clear through my mind.  
  
**(Chorus)**  
Oh that tower rose, five hundred yojana high,  
Gold and lapis bleeding into the sky.  
Tamāla and xanthochymus smoke filled the breeze,  
I could taste the Dharma in the trembling trees.  
*“Excellent! Excellent! Śākyamuni!”*  
Now the truth ain’t far — it’s breathing in me.  
  
⸻  
  
**(Verse 3 — The Sound of the Real)**  
Bells rang light as mercy’s tears,  
Drums rolled thunder through the years.  
A thousand Buddhas snapped their hands,  
And time broke open, shifting sands.  
The air itself turned radiant sound,  
And every heart was lifted from the ground.  
  
**(Bridge — The Hidden Gem)**  
I thought I was begging, bowl and bone,  
But the Master stitched a diamond of his own.  
He tied it deep, where no eyes could see,  
That gem of wisdom, burning in me.  
I was blind till that secret caught my sight,  
Now I wear patience like a robe of light.  
  
⸻  
  
**(Final Chorus — The Revelation Within)**  
Oh that tower rose, five hundred yojana high,  
Gold and lapis bleeding through the sky.  
Incense and thunder, truth in every tone,  
The gem in my garment is the stūpa of my own.  
*“Excellent! Excellent! Śākyamuni!”*  
Now the world itself is rising in me.
