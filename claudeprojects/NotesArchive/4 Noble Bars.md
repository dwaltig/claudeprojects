[Verse]  
Pain in the chest, dukkha daily grinding,  
Life's suffering, no silver lining,  
Yet we tread, the wheel's still winding,  
Karma tight rope, fate's binding.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Second Truth, cause of all that's whack,  
Tanha thirst, we keep coming back,  
Desires burning, no room to slack,  
Crave the world, future fades to black.  
  
[Chorus]  
Awake from dreams, enlightenment glows,  
Path of peace, true wisdom grows,  
 Noble route, where suffering flows,  
Eightfold trail, the truth exposes.  
  
[Bridge]  
Step by step, morality and skill,  
Mindfulness sharp, got the will,  
Concentration, the fire we distill,  
Liberation sweet, no bitter pill.  
  
[Verse 3]  
Speech right, action never in vain,  
Income clean, ethics maintain,  
Effort pure, heart stain to drain,  
Mind's focus tight, conquering brain.  
  
[Verse 4]  
Right view, intentions pure and tight ,  
Path leads straight into the light,  
Conscious rise, dark takes flight,  
Nirvana bound, peace in sight.
