Lyrics: (Verse 1) Yo, in the morning light, world's quiet, still, Whispers in the silence, got a promise to fulfill. Tune into the rhythm, let your spirit lead the way, Find yourself aligned, in the break of day.  
(Chorus) We resonate, universe in tune, Life's vibrations, we rockin' to the groove. Echoes of the cosmos, dreams take flight, Resonate, elevate, in the cosmic light.  
(Verse 2) Feel the magic happen, when we vibe with the stars, Every step we take, yeah, it ain't that far. Manifest destiny, with every word we say, Universe responds when we live this way.  
(Chorus) We resonate, universe in tune, Life's vibrations, we rockin' to the groove. Echoes of the cosmos, dreams take flight, Resonate, elevate, in the cosmic light.
