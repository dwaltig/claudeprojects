(Verse 1)  
Yo, check the mic, one two, wisdom's in the booth  
Droppin' knowledge bombs, dispellin' all the untruth  
World's gone crazy, lost its way, it's true  
But there's a path to peace, and I'ma share it with you  
  
(Chorus)  
Inner stillness, that's the key, unlock your higher self  
No need for drama, anger, puttin' wisdom on the shelf  
Open minds and open hearts, that's the winning crew  
Findin' understanding, breakin' through the old taboo  
  
(Verse 2)  
Teacher steppin' up, no ego, just the facts  
Droppin' ancient wisdom, ain't no turnin' back  
No need to battle, argue, prove who's wrong or right  
Just shine your inner light, illuminate the night  
  
(Chorus)  
Inner stillness, that's the key, unlock your higher self  
No need for drama, anger, puttin' wisdom on the shelf  
Open minds and open hearts, that's the winning crew  
Findin' understanding, breakin' through the old taboo  
  
(Bridge)  
Yo, listen up, it's time to rise above the noise  
Find the peace within, amplify your inner voice  
Silence all the chatter, let your spirit take the lead  
Plant the seeds of wisdom, watch your soul begin to bleed  
  
(Chorus)  
Inner stillness, that's the key, unlock your higher self  
No need for drama, anger, puttin' wisdom on the shelf  
Open minds and open hearts, that's the winning crew  
Findin' understanding, breakin' through the old taboo
