# “Train Your Heart to See”  
  
*A Dharma Blues for Clear Vision*  
  
**[Verse 1]**  
Well, I’ve been walkin’ this dusty road, my mind a tangled vine,  
Tryin’ to see the truth of things, but I keep fallin’ blind.  
Then I heard a whisper, soft and kind, sayin’, “Son, you gotta start,  
By trainin’ not your eyes alone, but the mirror in your heart.”  
  
**[Chorus]**  
Merit builds the path to wisdom, every kind deed sets you free,  
Each small act of love and courage clears the fog so you can see.  
You can’t rush the mountain’s sunrise, can’t fake the calm of mind,  
But when you walk with right understanding, truth ain’t hard to find.  
  
**[Verse 2]**  
They say faith is just a feelin’—I say it’s a way to know,  
You hear one line of true teachin’, and it starts to grow and grow.  
If you hold it in your chest like fire, let it burn your fear away,  
You’ll see the world in brighter colors than the dawn of Judgment Day.  
  
**[Chorus]**  
Merit builds the path to wisdom, every kind deed sets you free,  
Each small act of love and courage clears the fog so you can see.  
You can’t rush the mountain’s sunrise, can’t fake the calm of mind,  
But when you walk with right understanding, truth ain’t hard to find.  
  
**[Bridge – Spoken over slide guitar]**  
Faith and insight, they dance together,  
Like river and rain, one makes the other.  
Don’t talk ‘bout heaven, don’t talk ‘bout hell,  
Just learn to listen when silence tells.  
  
**[Verse 3]**  
Now I’m walkin’ the Eightfold Highway,  
With right thought ridin’ shotgun close.  
Right speech in my back pocket,  
Right action like a holy ghost.  
Each mile I make, I feel it clearer—  
The mind gets quiet, the heart gets wide,  
Merit turns to wisdom, brother,  
And the truth walks by your side.  
  
**[Final Chorus]**  
Merit builds the path to wisdom, every kind deed sets you free,  
Each small act of love and courage clears the fog so you can see.  
Don’t need gold or temple treasure,  
Just the will to live upright—  
When your heart’s a lamp of merit,  
You can see clear through the night.
