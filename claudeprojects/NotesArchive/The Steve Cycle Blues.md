Verse 1:  
She’s dated five Steves, maybe six, she’s losing track  
Each one starts out different, but they all end up the same way back  
She wonders if it’s destiny, or maybe just bad luck  
But every Steve’s a rerun, like a train she can’t unstuck  
  
Chorus:  
Round and round she goes, searching for something new  
But it’s Steves all the time, she’s got a déjà vu  
Round and round she goes, it’s just too much to believe  
Always falling in the arms, of another dang Steve  
  
Verse 2:  
Steve number seven was a dentist, Steve eight worked at a mall  
Nine was into crypto, ten was barely Steve at all  
She tried to change her ways, even swiped the other way  
But every time she turned around, a Steve was there to stay  
  
Chorus:  
Round and round she goes, searching for something new  
But it’s Steves all the time, she’s got a déjà vu  
Round and round she goes, it’s just too much to believe  
Always falling in the arms, of another dang Steve

Bridge:  
They say the universe repeats, when lessons go unlearned  
But how many Steves must one girl date, before her karma’s burned?  
Mindfulness is great and all, but she’s still stuck on Steves  
She’s ready to break the cycle, just give her a Todd, or please, a Steve reprieve!  
  
Chorus:  
Round and round she goes, searching for something new  
But it’s Steves all the time, she’s got a déjà vu  
Round and round she goes, it’s just too much to believe  
Always falling in the arms, of another dang Steve  
  
Outro:  
She’ll break free one day, of this Steve déjà vu  
Until then she’s stuck, with Steve number twenty-two  
Round and round she goes, but she’ll eventually leave  
And maybe next time, she’ll meet… not a Steve!
