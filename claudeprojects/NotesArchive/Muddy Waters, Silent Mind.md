# Muddy Waters, Silent Mind  
  
**“Muddy Waters, Silent Mind”** is a reflective blues folk song that draws inspiration from Nichiren’s *Shishin Gohon-Shō*, where he speaks of muddy water catching the moon’s reflection and trees receiving rain without deliberation. With soulful male vocals and a melodic, earthy arrangement, this song explores the quiet wisdom found in nature’s flow—no striving, no resistance, just being.  
  
Blending acoustic blues and folk tones, the track invites listeners into a space of calm awareness and spiritual presence. It’s a meditation on stillness, acceptance, and the beauty of letting life unfold without control.  
  
Let the muddy waters clear, and hear the moonlight sing.

[Verse 1]  
Muddy water  
Clear as the night  
Caught the moon’s face  
Holding it tight  
No thought it carried  
No plan to speak  
Yet it shone so bright in the shallow creek  
  
[Chorus]  
No mind to wander  
No part to play  
Nature’s rhythm finds its way  
Reflection dances  
Soft and true  
Muddy water holding the hue  
  
[Verse 2]  
The rain comes down  
A gentle sigh  
Trees gather drops from the heavy sky  
They reach and they open like humble hands  
No master plan  
But they understand  
  
[Chorus]  
No mind to wander  
No part to play  
Nature’s rhythm finds its way  
The world flows on  
No questions asked  
Muddy waters  
Holding the task  
  
[Bridge]  
Is it choice or fate that fills the stream?  
The glow of the moon or a fleeting dream?  
Plants won’t argue  
Trees won’t fight  
They stretch and they grow under the pale light  
  
[Verse 3]  
Oh  
The raven calls on the withered pine  
It doesn’t wonder  
It doesn’t pine  
Nature hums low  
No voice to refine  
Muddy water flows  
And the moon aligns
