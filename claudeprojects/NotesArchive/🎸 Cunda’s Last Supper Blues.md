# 🎸 Cunda’s Last Supper Blues  
#   
***Delta Style — Raw, Slow, 12-Bar, Spiritual-Blues Ballad***  
  
*“Cunda’s Last Supper”* is a raw, reverent Delta-style ballad retelling one of the most misunderstood moments in Buddhist history—the final meal offered to the Buddha by the humble blacksmith Cunda. Rooted in the spirit of the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*, the song blends ancient compassion with the gritty intimacy of American blues.  
  
The story unfolds through Cunda’s eyes: a working man who offers his best meal to the Buddha, only to later fear that he caused the Teacher’s final illness. The blues tradition of guilt, trembling hands, and honest sorrow becomes the perfect vehicle for this tale. But the song carries the deeper revelation preserved in the sutra—that the Buddha reassured Cunda that his offering was one of the two greatest meals in history, completing the arc of enlightenment with boundless merit.  
  
With minimal Delta blues instrumentation, warm lantern-lit imagery, and a voice soaked in humility and redemption, *“Cunda’s Last Supper Blues”* transforms a moment of anguish into a luminous teaching on grace. The song honors the working man’s heart, the compassion of the Eternal Buddha, and the quiet dignity of someone who fears they’ve harmed what they most love—only to be lifted by mercy beyond the world.  
  
A blues gospel of forgiveness and awakening, this track reveals the cosmic tenderness at the center of the Nirvāṇa Sūtra: **no act of sincere love is ever wasted.**  
  
**Verse 1**  
  
**I was just a poor old smith,**  
**Hands burnt, weary, thin…**  
**Cooked a supper for the Teacher,**  
**Didn’t know where he had been.**  
**When he bowed and took my offering,**  
**Lord, my heart began to spin.**  
  
**Verse 2**  
  
**Later on I heard him coughing,**  
**Saw his robe fall to the side…**  
**A cold wind blew through Pāvā,**  
**And the whole world turned its tide.**  
**I said, *“God forgive these hands of mine—***  
***Was it my food that made him die?”***  
  
⸻  
  
**Chorus**  
  
**Oh, I thought I broke the Holy One,**  
**Thought I crushed a living sun…**  
**Cried, “Lord, I didn’t mean no harm—**  
**I was only trying to feed someone.”**  
**But the Buddha sent word through Ānanda:**  
**“Child, your love and shame weigh none.”**  
  
⸻  
  
**Verse 3**  
  
**Ānanda found me trembling,**  
**Said, *“Brother, don’t you fall apart—***  
***The Blessed One is eternal,***  
***Can’t no sickness touch his heart.”***  
**He said, *“Cunda, your gift was sacred—***  
***From the start, child, from the start.”***  
  
**Verse 4**  
  
**He said there’s two great meals in history:**  
**One began the rising dawn…**  
**Given by sweet Sujātā**  
**On the day Enlightenment shone.**  
**And the other one, the final one—**  
**Brother, *your hands* carried it on.**  
  
⸻  
  
**Chorus**  
  
**Oh, I thought I broke the Holy One,**  
**Thought I crushed a living sun…**  
**Cried, “Lord, I didn’t mean no harm—**  
**I was only trying to feed someone.”**  
**But the Buddha sent word through Ānanda:**  
**“Child, your love and shame weigh none.”**  
  
⸻  
  
**Bridge (slow, spoken-blues)**  
  
**He said, *“Cunda, don’t you sorrow—***  
***Your heart is clean as morning rain.”***  
**Said, *“Your gift will echo through all worlds,***  
***Beyond all life, beyond all pain.”***  
**And right there my burden melted—**  
**Mercy washed away my shame.**  
  
⸻  
  
**Final Verse**  
  
**Now I walk these dusty backroads,**  
**Head bowed low, but spirit high…**  
**‘Cause the Buddha said my offering**  
**Helped him reach the other side.**  
**I ain’t a sinner nor a killer—**  
**I’m the man who helped him rise.**  
  
⸻  
  
**Final Chorus (soft, warm)**  
  
**Oh, I never broke the Holy One,**  
**Never dimmed that shining sun…**  
**I just fed him like a brother,**  
**Did my work, then it was done.**  
**And he whispered through the silence:**  
**“Cunda, child… you and I are one.”**
