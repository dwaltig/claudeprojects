# The Strength of Kindness (Secular Version)  
  
Verse 1:  
The strength of kindness builds my home;  
forbearance clothes me tight,  
In quiet moments, I find meaning,  
a clear and guiding light.  
When faced with anger, stones, or threats,  
remember your own strength,  
Your courage stretches far and wide,  
and goes to any length.  
  
Chorus:  
In whispers of the mountain air,  
in the echoes of the deep,  
Your quiet wisdom guides all who dare  
their truest path to keep.  
To the brave who walks this path alone,  
even when I'm gone,  
The kindness you have always shown,  
ensures you're never alone.  
  
Chorus:  
In whispers of the mountain air,  
in the echoes of the deep,  
Your quiet wisdom guides all who dare  
their truest path to keep.  
To the brave who walks this path alone,  
even when I'm gone,  
The kindness you have always shown,  
ensures you're never alone.  
  
Verse 2:  
To the brave who shares these timeless words,  
after I depart,  
The strength we built will now fortify  
his quiet heart.  
Though taunts may fly and threats may rise,  
supporters take a stand,  
Alone in study 'neath foreign skies,  
in mountains grand or wild lands.  
  
Chorus:  
In whispers of the mountain air,  
in the echoes of the deep,  
Your quiet wisdom guides all who dare  
their truest path to keep.  
To the brave who walks this path alone,  
even when I'm gone,  
The kindness you have always shown,  
ensures you're never alone.  
  
Chorus:  
In whispers of the mountain air,  
in the echoes of the deep,  
Your quiet wisdom guides all who dare  
their truest path to keep.  
To the brave who walks this path alone,  
even when I'm gone,  
The kindness you have always shown,  
ensures you're never alone.

Bridge:  
The wisdom comes in shimmering light,  
reminds you of the promise made,  
In solitude's embrace or wild night,  
that inner strength will never fade.  
Kindred spirits, friends unseen,  
a circle to keep company,  
Such blessings flow, serene, unseen,  
whether sharing or in solitary.  
  
Chorus:  
In whispers of the mountain air,  
in the echoes of the deep,  
Your quiet wisdom guides all who dare  
their truest path to keep.  
To the brave who walks this path alone,  
even when I'm gone,  
The kindness you have always shown,  
ensures you're never alone.
