**Subject: Gentle Reminder: Pet Etiquette at Briarpoint Condominiums**  
  
Dear Briarpoint Condominium Homeowners,  
  
I hope this message finds you well. As we continue to enjoy our beautiful community, I'd like to offer a friendly reminder about our pet guidelines to ensure a comfortable and clean environment for all residents.  
  
**Pet Walking Guidelines:**  
1. **Leash Requirement**: Please ensure your pets, particularly dogs, are on a secured leash while in common areas. This helps maintain safety and comfort for all residents and pets alike.  
2. **Relief Areas**: Kindly take your dogs off the property for their "relief" needs. This practice helps keep our common areas clean and hygienic for everyone to enjoy.  
3. **Clean-Up Duty**: It's crucial to clean up after your pets in common areas. This responsibility keeps our grounds pristine and enjoyable for all.  
  
These simple yet significant steps contribute to a harmonious living environment for our pet-loving community. Your cooperation and understanding in adhering to these guidelines are greatly appreciated.  
  
Thank you for your attention to this matter and for helping make Briarpoint Condominiums a wonderful place for all residents—both two and four-legged!  
  
Warm regards,
