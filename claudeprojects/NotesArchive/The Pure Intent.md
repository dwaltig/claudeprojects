**The Pure Intent**  
  
**Renounce the pride, let envy fall,**  
**Malice and falsehood, leave them all.**  
**No disparaging words, no faults to seek,**  
**In wisdom’s voice, let kindness speak.**  
  
**For sharing truth is not a game,**  
**Not for glory, not for fame.**  
**Humble hearts must light the way,**  
**Guiding souls through night to day.**  
  
**Bodhisattvas, like stars in space,**  
**Compassionate guides of boundless grace.**  
**They walk with love, their pride set wide,**  
**Illuminating paths where hope resides.**  
  
**To preach is not to claim the throne,**  
**But to help each seeker find their own.**  
**With words of care and light to lend,**  
**True wisdom flows when egos bend.**  
  
**So cast aside the need to win,**  
**Let truth and love arise within.**  
**For countless beings, protect with light,**  
**Pure intent turns darkness bright.**  
  
**This is the way of the wise and true,**  
**A lesson for all, not just the few.**  
**To live, to share, with hearts sincere,**  
**Is the modern call we all must hear.**
