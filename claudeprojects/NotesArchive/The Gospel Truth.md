# The Gospel Truth  
  
In the tradition of grounded blues and folk, this song offers a heartfelt meditation on universal salvation and the liberating message of the Lotus Sūtra. Drawing inspiration from the teachings of Nichiren, it challenges the notion that enlightenment is reserved for a select few. Through the lens of storytelling and a soulful, fingerpicked guitar, the song celebrates the inherent worth and Buddha-nature in every being—from the 'evil man' to the 'weary woman'—and proclaims that the light of the Dharma shines for all, regardless of their past or present state. It's a reminder that true compassion seeks to save everyone, offering hope to those who have been left behind."

Lyrics:   
(Fingerpicked acoustic guitar intro, a steady, low-down rhythm with a hint of melancholy)  
  
(Verse 1)   
They say the road to glory's narrow, Lord, a path for the chosen few   
They tell you some are born for sorrow, and their souls just can't break through   
They preached from high and mighty pulpits, a doctrine hard and cold   
Said some folks ain't got the nature, a story long since told   
Yeah, they left the humble and the broken on the outside lookin' in   
Afraid to knock on heaven's door, washed clean of all their sin  
  
(Chorus)   
But I heard a whisper on the wind, a song from the Lotus bloom   
Said no one's left behind, brother, no one's sealed inside a tomb   
From the evil man and the weary woman, to the fool who's lost his way   
This True-nature burns within 'em, like the sun on a cloudy day   
Yeah, that old Sūtra says a broken soul can heal and rise up new   
The light of the Dharma shines for all, and that's the gospel truth.  
  
(Verse 2)   
The old teachers said a wicked heart, like Devadatta's, could never mend   
Said the dragon girl, in her form, could never reach the end   
They put up walls and drew their lines, made salvation a bitter fight   
Said you gotta change your very bones to stand in the Buddha's light   
But Nichiren heard a different sound, a roar that shook the earth   
Said every single life holds worth, since the day of its blessed birth  
  
(Chorus)   
'Cause I heard a whisper on the wind, a song from the Lotus bloom   
Said no one's left behind, brother, no one's sealed inside a tomb   
From the evil man and the weary woman, to the fool who's lost his way   
This True-nature burns within 'em, like the sun on a cloudy day   
Yeah, that old Sūtra says a broken soul can heal and rise up new   
The light of the Dharma shines for all, and that's the gospel truth.  
  
(Guitar solo, bluesy and emotional, with a simple, melodic line that climbs higher with each phrase, then returns to the root notes)  
  
(Bridge)   
It ain't about pride or arrogance, a voice just wanting to be heard   
It's a deep-down compassion, built on the Wonderful Word   
It's the faith that persecution can't steal, a fire that won't give out   
It's knowing everyone you meet, they got a way to rise and shout  
  
(Outro)   
Yeah, it's the gospel truth...   
That the humble and the simple...   
They got a light, too...   
And that's a blessing... a blessing... just for me and you.   
  
(Guitar fades out with a final, resonant chord)
