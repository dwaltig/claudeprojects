# Whispers of Peaceful Life  
  
In the twilight of the ages, Manjusrī seeks the Lord’s decree, “Great Bodhisattvas, tread with reverence, For the path ahead is steeped in mystery.”  
  
With patience as their steadfast shield, And meekness woven in their stride, They navigate the shadows cast By ignorance and pride.  
  
No crown or kingdom to entice, They shun the glare of royal halls, Avoiding whispers of deceit, Eschewing pride’s alluring calls.  
  
In silent strength, they hold their ground, Detached from fleeting worldly ties, Embracing void where laws dissolve, Seeing truth through wisdom’s eyes.  
  
No disputes to mar their peace, No envy in their gentle gaze, They preach the Dharma’s endless light, Guiding souls through darkest days.  
  
Like kings who guard their sacred gems, They preserve the Lotus’ lore, Sharing hope through every verse, Unlocking Dharma’s door.  
  
Their hearts, a beacon in the night, Illuminate the path to Buddha’s grace, With every step, they sow the seeds Of compassion’s warm embrace.  
Their hearts, a beacon in the night, Illuminate the path to Buddha’s grace, With every step, they sow the seeds Of compassion’s warm embrace.  
Their hearts, a beacon in the night, Illuminate the path to Buddha’s grace, With every step, they sow the seeds Of compassion’s warm embrace.  
Their hearts, a beacon in the night, Illuminate the path to Buddha’s grace, With every step, they sow the seeds Of compassion’s warm embrace.  
  
Through valleys deep and mountains high, Their mission echoes far and wide, Creating waves of endless peace, Where all of Earth’s children reside.  
  
In dreams, the Tathāgata speaks, Revealing truths beyond the veil, As Bodhisattvas march ahead, Their sacred hearts prevail.  
  
Enduring trials, unafraid, They forge a path of light and love, Bound by duty, pure and strong, Guided by the stars above.  
  
So let their whispers fill the air, A testament to steadfast souls, Who, in their peaceful, noble quest, Transform the world, make whole.  
So let their whispers fill the air, A testament to steadfast souls, Who, in their peaceful, noble quest, Transform the world, make whole.
