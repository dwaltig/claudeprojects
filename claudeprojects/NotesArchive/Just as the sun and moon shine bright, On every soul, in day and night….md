Just as the sun and moon shine bright, On every soul, in day and night. No matter if you’re wrong or right, Their light is shared with equal might.

Like a potter with his clay, Forms vessels for both work and play. For sugar, water, milk, and whey, From the same earth, in the same way.  
\

Although the vessels may hold, Different contents, hot or cold, The clay, its essence, never sold, Is in each pot, for young and old.

The Tathagata, with wisdom’s key, Unlocks for all, the mystery. Three vehicles, it seems to be, But one true path, to set us free.

Who are ignorant, they spin, In the world’s unending din. Understanding from within, The path to blessed rest begins.

When the world, you truly see, From the mundane, you are free. Yet, the disciple may decree, “I’ve reached Nirvana, blissfully.”

But the Jina, wise and true, Says, “There’s more for you to do. Without knowing all laws, in view, True Nirvana, you never knew.”

Like a man, born without sight, Who claims there’s no day, no night. No sun, no moon, no starlight, For he’s known only endless night.

But a doctor, kind and wise, Brings the man a great surprise. From the mountain, he supplies, Four herbs, for the man’s eyes.

With these herbs, the man can see, From his blindness, he is free. “I was wrong, I now agree, The world is more than I decree.”  
With these herbs, the man can see, From his blindness, he is free. “I was wrong, I now agree, The world is more than I decree.”  
  
So too, are the beings, blind, In the whirl of life, confined. Until Tathagata, kind, Opens the eye of the mind.  
  
To the blind, Tathagata shows, Three vehicles, to ease their woes. But only one true path bestows, The way to where enlightenment flows.
