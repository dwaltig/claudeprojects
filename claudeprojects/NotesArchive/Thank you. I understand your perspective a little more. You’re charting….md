Thank you. I understand your perspective a little more. You’re charting dangerous territory with this cult mentality. Nichiren points out in Gosho 110, you’re no different than other sects, especially Zen- preaching a teacher’s teachings. The greatest lie I continue to hear repeated is, the Lotus Sūtra is too complicated for many people to understand, most incredible slander. This Lotus Sūtra is true Buddhism. It is true in teaching, theory, and practice.
