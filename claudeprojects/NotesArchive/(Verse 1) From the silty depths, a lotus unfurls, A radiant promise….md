(Verse 1) From the silty depths, a lotus unfurls, A radiant promise against shadowed worlds. Each heart holds the strength to rise and mend, On life's winding path, our spirits transcend.  
  
(Chorus) The current of wisdom, a river so deep, In boundless affection, our souls find their keep. From peaks of elation to valleys of woe, Compassion's soft glow guides the way we should go.  
  
(Verse 2) With myriad voices, beliefs taking flight, The Sutra's essence, a timeless, guiding light. Through skillful pathways, the heart finds its ease, A compass for all who yearn for inner peace.  
  
(Chorus) The current of wisdom, a river so deep, In boundless affection, our souls find their keep. From peaks of elation to valleys of woe, Compassion's soft glow guides the way we should go.  
  
(Bridge) Buddhahood's potential, in every heart concealed, A nascent flame, through the cycles revealed. In each trial we face, a chance to ascend, Like the lotus stretching, where sky and earth blend.  
  
(Verse 3) Not for self alone, but for all to embrace, Compassion in action, with purpose and grace. A globe intertwined, our hands as one, Sharing wisdom's bounty, till our journeys are done.  
  
(Chorus) The current of wisdom, a river so deep, In boundless affection, our souls find their keep. From peaks of elation to valleys of woe, Compassion's soft glow guides the way we should go.  
  
(Outro) Let the Sutra’s cadence in our spirits flow, In every heart's chamber, its love will bestow. A lotus unfolding, in hearts true and bright, A pathway of wisdom, ever shining its light.
