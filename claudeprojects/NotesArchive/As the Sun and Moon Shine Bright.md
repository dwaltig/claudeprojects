As the Sun and Moon Shine Bright  
    
Just as the sun and moon shine bright,    
On every soul, in day and night.    
No matter if you’re wrong or right,    
Their light shines forth with equal might.  
  
And just as wisdom, pure and grand,    
From the Tathagata’s guiding hand,    
Reaches every tribe, every land,    
With love no soul can withstand.  
  
Like a potter shaping clay,    
He forms vessels, work or play.    
For sugar, water, milk, or whey,    
The same earth in the same way.  
  
Though vessels differ in what they hold—    
Some keep heat, some the cold—    
The clay itself, forever bold,    
Remains the same for young and old.  
  
The Tathagata, with wisdom’s key,    
Unlocks for all the mystery.    
Three paths may seem the destiny,    
But one great road will set us free.  
  
The ignorant spin, and always spin,    
Lost in life’s unending din.    
Yet understanding, deep within,    
Shows where the true path must begin.  
  
When the world, at last, you see,    
From mundane chains, you are set free.    
But the disciple may decree,    
“I’ve reached Nirvana, blissfully.”  
  
Yet the Jina, wise and true,    
Says, “There’s more for you to do.    
Until all laws you see in view,    
True Nirvana escapes from you.”  
  
Like the man, born without sight,    
Who claims there is no day, no night.    
No sun, no moon, no starlight bright,    
For all he’s known is endless night.  
  
But a doctor, kind and wise,    
Brings forth for him a great surprise.    
From the mountain, he supplies    
Four great herbs to heal his eyes.  
  
With these herbs, the man now sees,    
From blindness’ grip, at last released.    
He cries, “I was wrong, I now agree—    
The world is more than I decreed.”  
  
So too, all beings blind are found,    
In life’s wild wheel, spinning ‘round,    
Till Tathagata’s voice resounds,    
And opens their minds to profound.  
  
To the blind, Tathagata shows    
Three paths to ease their worldly woes.    
But only one true road bestows    
The way where enlightenment flows.
