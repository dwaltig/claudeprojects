**(Verse 1)**   
Trouble's knockin', soul's feelin' low,   
Like a ship lost, where the wild winds blow.   
Guiding light, shine your beam so bright,   
Lead me home, through the darkest night.  
  
**(Chorus)**   
Oh, Goodness, hear my weary call,   
Lift me up when I stumble and fall.   
Grant my wishes, make my path clear,   
In every triumph, let my heart cheer.  
  
(Verse 2)   
Offerings I bring, a humble heart,   
Pure intentions, a brand new start.   
Let plans unfold, like seeds in the ground,   
In every victory, let joy resound.  
  
(Chorus)   
Oh, Goodness, hear my weary call,   
Lift me up when I stumble and fall.   
Grant my wishes, make my path clear,   
In every triumph, let my heart cheer.  
  
(Bridge)   
The spirit bright, Goodness' own light,   
Shines through darkness, day and night.   
Though shadows dance and troubles rise,   
Call on Goodness, reach for the skies.  
  
(Verse 3)   
They may falter, their power may fade,   
But we'll rise up, unafraid.   
Grant us victory, Goodness so true,   
Answer our call, in all we do.  
  
(Chorus)   
Oh, Goodness, hear my weary call,   
Lift me up when I stumble and fall.   
Grant my wishes, make my path clear,   
In every triumph, let my heart cheer.  
  
(Outro)   
Goodness, Goodness, hear my plea,   
In every step, walk with me
