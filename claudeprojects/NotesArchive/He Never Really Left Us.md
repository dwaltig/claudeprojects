# He Never Really Left Us  
  
*He Never Really Left* starts with dawn‑blue melancholy and rolls into a foot‑stompin’, heart‑healin’ groove. Finger‑picked acoustic, brushed snare, and mournful slide guitar frame a lyric that spins the Lotus Sūtra’s great reveal: the Buddha’s still here, whispering on every breath—“each drifting dust‑mote glowing shows the Buddha here and know.”  
  
Verses trace the feeling of abandonment when the Teacher “passed on over,” but gospel‑style choruses push back with radiant hope. By the final outro, the singer walks on—free, upright, and shining the “Buddha deep in me.”

Lyrics:  
(Verse 1)  
Woke up this mornin', world feelin' heavy and grey  
Got that human condition, couldn't find my way  
Feelin' lost and confused, no friendly light to see  
Just the creepin' shadows growin' over me.  
  
(Verse 2)  
Heard stories 'bout the Buddha, from a time long, long ago  
Found his truth beneath the tree, let his wisdom flow  
Then I read he left this world, entered stillness deep and vast  
Lord, he passed on over, thought our hope was fading fast.  
  
(Chorus)  
He never really left us,  
Still whispers on the wind.  
In every breath we’re takin’,  
His light comes shinin’ in.  
  
But oh, that human story, it pulled me down so low  
Believed the Teacher left me, with nowhere else to go  
But his Dharma light keeps shinin', burnin' ever bright  
Inside this weary spirit, leadin' me to the light.  
  
(Verse 3)  
Yeah, that story hit me hard, like a bitter, bitter pill  
Feelin' so abandoned, standin' frozen, mighty still  
Saw no earthly doctor, for this ache within my soul  
Just a cryin' emptiness, had lost all my control.  
  
(Verse 4)  
But the sages reminded me, it's a lesson for us all,  
A skillful, gentle method, so we don't stumble, fall.  
Said his True Self never left us, though his earthly forms may flow,  
Each drifting dust‑mote glowing shows the Buddha here and now   
  
(Chorus)  
He never really left us,  
Still whispers on the wind.  
In every breath we’re takin’,  
His light comes shinin’ in.  
  
And oh, that human story, it pulled me down so low  
Believed the Teacher left me, with nowhere else to go  
But his Dharma light keeps shinin', burnin' ever bright  
Inside this weary spirit, leadin' me to the light.  
  
(Verse 5)  
They say there's somethin' in me, a potential, clear and bright  
Like a diamond in the rough now, waitin' to shine its light.  
It's the Buddha-nature, they say, can turn the darkest tide,  
Yeah, my own true, shining aspect, I no longer need to hide.  
  
(Verse 6)  
Gotta walk this path now, in the messy, real everyday,  
With quiet acts of kindness, chasin' all the blues away.  
His presence walks beside me, in the night and in the day,  
He wants us all to waken, find that clear and open way.  
  
(Chorus)  
He never really left us,  
Still whispers on the wind.  
In every breath we’re takin’,  
His light comes shinin’ in.  
  
And oh, that human story, it pulled me down so low  
Believed the Teacher left me, with nowhere else to go  
But his Dharma light keeps shinin', burnin' ever bright  
Inside this weary spirit, leadin' me to the light.  
  
(Outro)  
Yeah, that eternal Buddha, always reachin' out for me  
And the teaching says we're Buddhas, if we only dare to be.  
Gonna keep on walkin', till my spirit's truly free.  
Gonna keep on walkin', for the Buddha deep in me.
