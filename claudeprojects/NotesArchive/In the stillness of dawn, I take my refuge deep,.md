In the stillness of dawn, I take my refuge deep,  
Not in the hills, nor in fleeting winds that sweep,  
But in the heart that holds the universe whole,  
A refuge beyond the mountains, within the soul.  
  
The arrows of darkness, they bend and they break,  
At the hands of the just, who rise for truth’s sake.  
Though shadows may gather, and foundations may fall,  
The wise one walks gently, beholding it all.  
  
For within every heart, Awakening does dwell,  
For within every heart, Awakening does dwell,  
For within every heart, Awakening does dwell,  
For within every heart, Awakening does dwell,  
For within every heart, Awakening does dwell,  
In the face of suffering, It casts Its spell—  
In the face of suffering, It casts Its spell—  
In the face of suffering, It casts Its spell—  
In the face of suffering, It casts Its spell—  
In the face of suffering, It casts Its spell—  
In the face of suffering, It casts Its spell—  
Not one of escape, but of eyes open wide,  
Seeing through delusion, casting fear aside.  
  
From the heavens, the Lord of Compassion peers,  
Through the veils of sorrow, through our earthly tears.  
His gaze weighs not judgment, but wisdom’s embrace,  
For each soul is a mirror, reflecting His grace.  
  
Those who delight in the fire, the storm, the rage,  
Shall find in their fury, they’ve crafted a cage.  
Yet the wind of mercy will blow it away,  
For even the cruel find light in a new day.  
  
The righteous, they see, beyond death and beyond birth,  
The eternal truth that echoes across the Earth.  
For all paths converge where love is the law,  
And the face of the Divine is what we all saw.  
  
So take your refuge, not in flight, but in peace,  
Where the heart’s quiet song grants sweet release.  
For the **Lord is the Awakened One, Oh, He is the Lord**—  
For the **Lord is the Awakened One, Oh, He is the Lord**—  
For the **Lord is the Awakened One, Oh, He is the Lord**—  
For the **Lord is the Awakened One, Oh, He is the Lord**—  
For the **Lord is the Awakened One, Oh, He is the Lord**—  
For the **Lord is the Awakened One, Oh, He is the Lord**—  
For the **Lord is the Awakened One, Oh, He is the Lord**—  
For the **Lord is the Awakened One, Oh, He is the Lord**—  
In every just action, the Truth is restored.
