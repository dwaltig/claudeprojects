Dear ,  
  
It’s wonderful to hear about your interest in what your son is learning with us. Through building toys like tops with Legos, students are exploring fundamental physics concepts hands-on. For instance, when creating a top, they learn about rotational motion and how the distribution of mass can affect an object’s balance and spin.  
  
The axle of a top is a clear example of how force is transmitted from our hands to create motion. By spinning the top, students see the principles of angular momentum in action, which is the same principle that keeps the Earth rotating around its axis. They also learn about friction, stability, and energy—all important concepts in physics that govern how things move in our world.  
  
We aim to make these lessons tangible and relatable, using toys to represent complex ideas. This way, they can see the immediate effects of these principles at play, fostering an intuitive grasp of physics that they can build on as they grow older.  
  
We are thrilled to see students like your son engage so enthusiastically with these projects and look forward to nurturing their curiosity and understanding of the world through such interactive lessons.  
  
Warm regards,
