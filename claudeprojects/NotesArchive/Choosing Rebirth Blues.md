Lyrics:  
  
[Verse 1:]  
Here I stand at life’s great divide,  
Paths ahead, each one untold,  
Seeking a place where the soul can hide,  
Or take the hand of fate and be bold.  
  
[Chorus 1:]  
Oh, I’m yearning, oh, I’m longing,  
For a life that’s new and bright,  
But the weight of all my yesterdays,  
Holds me back in the still of night.  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Karma’s chains, they bind me tight,  
Every step’s a heavy toll,  
Whispers of my past lives’ plight,  
In my ear, they take their hold.  
  
[Chorus 2:]  
Do I accept or do I fight,  
This fate that’s been assigned,  
Or do I rise, find a new light,  
Leave the past far behind?  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[Bridge:]  
One step forward, can’t look back,  
Choose my path, don’t lose my way,  
Into the river or off the track,  
A new life starts today.  
  
[Verse 3:]  
Fear and hope, they walk as one,  
Leaving what was, embracing what’s to come,  
Step by step, toward the rising sun,  
Into a life where I’m not numb.  
  
[Final Chorus:]  
Oh, I’m rising, oh, I’m ready,  
To face this life anew,  
With every breath, my soul is steady,  
Embracing what is true.  
  
[Outro:]  
I’ll walk this path, come what may,  
With the dawn of a brand new day.
