Lyrics:   
[Verse]  
Lost in your eyes  
But now they're cold  
Mem'ries of love  
No warmth to hold  
  
[Verse 2]  
We had our dreams  
Now they are dust  
Heartbreak in air  
Shadows of trust  
  
[Chorus]  
Why did you go  
Left me alone  
Love fades away  
Sadness has grown  
  
[Verse 3]  
Nights feel so long  
Without your smile  
Time moves too slow  
Pain all the while  
  
[Bridge]  
Was it worth it  
The tears we cried  
Moments we've lost  
Hurt we can't hide  
  
[Chorus]  
Why did you go  
Left me alone  
Love fades away  
Sadness has grown  
  
[Bridge]  
Was it worth it  
The tears we cried  
Moments we've lost  
Hurt we can't hide  
  
[Chorus]  
Why did you go  
Left me alone  
Love fades away  
Sadness has grown  
  
  
[Bridge]  
Was it worth it  
The tears we cried  
Moments we've lost  
Hurt we can't hide  
  
[Chorus]  
Why did you go  
Left me alone  
Love fades away  
Sadness has grown
