For your storyboard based on the script "Case Studies," focusing on the Lotus Sutra's themes of compassion and wisdom, I suggest a sequence of illustrations that reflect these principles in action. Here's a breakdown:  
  
**Frame 1: Introduction to the Lotus Sutra**  
- Visual: A serene, contemplative scene, perhaps with a figure sitting under a lotus tree, reading or meditating.  
- Caption: "The enduring relevance of the Lotus Sutra."  
  
**Frame 2: Humanitarian Workers as Modern Bodhisattvas**  
- Visual: Show humanitarian workers in action - aiding people in a disaster zone, distributing food, or comforting the distressed.  
- Caption: "Humanitarian workers, embodying the virtues of compassion and selflessness."  
  
**Frame 3: Social Activists for Justice**  
- Visual: A peaceful protest or rally. Depict diverse activists holding signs for justice and equality, their expressions determined yet compassionate.  
- Caption: "Social activists fighting for justice, aligning with the Sutra's teachings."  
  
**Frame 4: The Practicality of the Teachings**  
- Visual: Split scene - one side showing someone reading the Lotus Sutra, the other side showing them applying its teachings in daily life, like helping a neighbor.  
- Caption: "The principles of the Lotus Sutra in action."  
  
**Frame 5: Compassion as Strength**  
- Visual: A powerful image of an individual standing resilient amidst adversity, their stance compassionate yet strong.  
- Caption: "Compassion: A manifestation of profound strength."  
  
**Frame 6: Wisdom in Contemporary Life**  
- Visual: Modern cityscape with individuals facing various challenges, yet finding solace and guidance in small acts of kindness and wisdom.  
- Caption: "Wisdom embedded in the Lotus Sutra helping navigate contemporary life."  
  
**Frame 7: Impact of Individual Actions**  
- Visual: A montage of different individuals making small but impactful actions - planting trees, teaching children, aiding the elderly.  
- Caption: "Individual actions, grounded in wisdom and compassion, making a significant impact."  
  
In terms of illustration techniques:  
- Focus on facial expressions to convey the emotions of compassion, determination, and wisdom.  
- Use color contrasts to highlight the central themes - warm tones for compassion and cooler tones for adversity or challenges.  
- Incorporate symbolic elements, like lotuses or serene landscapes, to reinforce the themes of the Sutra.  
  
Remember, the key is to visually represent the script's message, showing how the teachings of the Lotus Sutra manifest in real-world actions and scenarios.
