# The Wheel of Life Blues  
  
**“The Wheel of Life Blues”** is a soulful blues track inspired by a profound lecture on the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination and the concept of impermanence in Buddhism. The song weaves together themes of ignorance, change, and self-realization, reflecting on how habitual patterns and unnoticed cycles shape our lives. With evocative lyrics that touch on the fleeting nature of existence—symbolized by the night-blooming Tan Hua flower—the song invites listeners on a journey of introspection. The melody carries the depth of traditional blues, while the storytelling resonates with universal truths about the human experience. Let the music guide you through the cycles of life, awakening a deeper understanding within.

Intentions lead to actions, actions build our fate,    
Yeah, intentions lead to actions, actions build our fate.    
Can't escape the mirror, when the hour's getting late.

Consciousness awakens, in the cradle of a womb,    
Oh, consciousness awakens, in the cradle of a womb.    
From birth to aging wrinkles, we're marching to the tomb.  
From birth to aging wrinkles, we're marching to the tomb.

If I could see the patterns, the links that bind us tight,    
I'd free myself from longing, step into the light.  
I'd free myself from longing, step into the light.  
  
Verse 1:  
I walked a path last night, shadows on my mind,    
Yeah, I walked a path last night, shadows on my mind.    
Ignorance wrapped around me, like a fog I couldn't find.  
  
Verse 2:  
Saw a flower bloom at dusk, wither by the morn',    
Oh, saw a flower bloom at dusk, wither by the morn'.    
Impermanence is callin', in this world where we are born.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, the wheel keeps on turnin', round and round we go,    
Caught in this cycle, from the seeds we sow.    
Break these chains of sorrow, let the wisdom flow.  
  
Verse 3:  
Intentions lead to actions, actions build our fate,    
Yeah, intentions lead to actions, actions build our fate.    
Can't escape the mirror, when the hour's getting late.  
  
Verse 4:  
Consciousness awakens, in the cradle of a womb,    
Oh, consciousness awakens, in the cradle of a womb.    
From birth to aging wrinkles, we're marching to the tomb.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, the wheel keeps on turnin', life's a river wide,    
Drifting on these currents, with desire as our guide.    
Searching for an anchor, somewhere deep inside.  
  
Bridge:  
If I could see the patterns, the links that bind us tight,    
I'd free myself from longing, step into the light.  
  
Verse 5:  
So I sit in meditation, let the stillness speak,    
Yeah, I sit in meditation, find the truth I seek.    
Beyond the veil of Maya, it's enlightenment I greet.  
  
Final Chorus:  
Oh, the wheel keeps on turnin', but I can choose my way,    
Break the chains of cycles, see a brighter day.    
In the heart of silence, the blues just fade away.  
In the heart of silence, the blues just fade away.
