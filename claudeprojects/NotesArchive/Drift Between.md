# *Drift Between*  
  
**[Intro – Whispered, soft left channel]**  
**Close your eyes…**  
**Feel the weight of the air…**  
**Slowly… slowly… drift in…**  
  
**[Right channel, gentle and low]**  
**Let go now…**  
**Let the stillness begin…**  
**Falling softly within…**  
  
**[Verse 1 – Melodic, centered voice]**  
**Breathing in, breathing out…**  
**Floating free of the doubt…**  
**Every sound melts away…**  
**You’re lighter than the light of day…**  
  
**[Chorus – Binaural shift, oscillating left to right]**  
**Left side… quiet tides…**  
**Right side… open wide…**  
**Sink down… deeper down…**  
**Let the silence pull you around…**  
  
**[Verse 2 – Right channel, close and intimate]**  
**The air is warm, the mind unwinds…**  
**Feel the pulse between the lines…**  
**Every thought dissolves like rain…**  
**Drifting down… no need to explain…**  
  
**[Bridge – Slower tempo, layered vocals in stereo]**  
**(Left) Floating down…**  
**(Right) Letting go…**  
**(Left) Deeper now…**  
**(Right) Soft and slow…**  
  
**[Chorus – Stronger binaural effect]**  
**Left side… quiet tides…**  
**Right side… open wide…**  
**Sink down… deeper down…**  
**Let the silence pull you around…**  
  
**[Outro – Whispered, left to right echo]**  
**Here you are… you have arrived…**  
**No need to speak, just stay inside…**  
**Feel the glow… as you rest…**  
**Let your mind feel weightless…**  
  
**[Final fade-out – Whispered simultaneously in both channels]**  
**Drift… drift… drift…**  
  
**Would you like me to add specific suggestions for binaural frequencies or background sounds to enhance the effect?**
