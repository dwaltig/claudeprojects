Host: What if you held the key to ultimate enlightenment? What if it wasn't just for you, but for everyone?

(Text overlay appears: The Lotus of the True Law - Chapter 22: Entrustment A second time, a third time, the Lord spoke to the host of Bodhisattvas after taking them by the right hands: Into your hands, young individuals of good family, I transfer and transmit, entrust and deposit this supreme and perfect enlightenment arrived at by me after hundred thousands of myriads of kotis of incalculable eons. Receive it, young individuals of good family, keep, read, fathom, teach, promulgate, and preach it to all beings. I am not avaricious, young people of good family, nor narrow-minded; I am confident and willing to impart Buddha knowledge, to impart the knowledge of the Tathagata, the knowledge of the Self-born. I am a bountiful giver, young ones of good family, and ye, young folks of good family, follow my example; imitate me in liberally showing this knowledge of the Tathagata, and in skilfulness, and preach this Dharmaparyaya to the young men and young ladies of good family who successively shall gather round you. And as to unbelieving persons, rouse them to accept this law. By so doing, young individuals of good family, you will acquit your debt to the Tathagatas.)
