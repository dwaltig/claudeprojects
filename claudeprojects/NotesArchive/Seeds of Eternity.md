[Lyrics: Verse]  
Dusty roads and faded signs  
We wander lost from time to time  
Our actions plant a seed so small  
Blossoms grow despite the fall  
  
[Chorus]  
Trust the heart in every day  
What we do comes back some way  
Scattered seeds in endless fields  
In moments  
Truth's revealed  
  
[Verse 2]  
Through the rain and through the storm  
Every choice  
A quiet form  
Of the love we can't foresee  
Shaping all our destiny  
  
[Chorus]  
Trust the heart in every day  
What we do comes back some way  
Scattered seeds in endless fields  
In moments  
Truth's revealed  
  
[Bridge]  
Every glance and every touch  
Whispers more than words can say  
Boundless merits bloom from us  
In the heart  
They find their way  
  
[Chorus]  
Trust the heart in every day  
What we do comes back some way  
Scattered seeds in endless fields  
In moments  
Truth's revealed
