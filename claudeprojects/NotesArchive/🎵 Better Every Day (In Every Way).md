# 🎵 Better Every Day (In Every Way)  
  
**By William Altig & Muse**  
  
⸻  
  
**Verse 1**  
  
Woke up with the sunrise on my face,  
Another chance to try, another day of grace.  
A little more kind than I was before,  
Got a heart that’s open, and a soul that soars.  
  
⸻  
  
**Chorus**  
  
We’re just gettin’ better, every day and every way,  
Step by step, come what may.  
Makin’ peace with yesterday,  
We’re just gettin’ better, every day and every way.  
  
⸻  
  
**Verse 2**  
  
There’ve been droughts that cracked the soul,  
Days I felt I’d lost control.  
But still I dug down through the clay,  
Lookin’ for the truth to show the way.  
I walked through shadows just to learn,  
That even thirst can help us yearn.  
  
⸻  
  
**Bridge**  
  
And the ones who’ve walked this road before,  
They guide my steps from distant shores.  
In every breath, in every fall,  
They whisper, “Child, you’ve heard the call.”  
  
⸻  
  
**Verse 3**  
  
I’ve stumbled through my corner of this land,  
Tryin’ to live with open hands.  
Some days I walk, some days I crawl,  
But I keep listenin’ for that higher call.  
Insight grows like a candle’s flame,  
Givin’ light, not seekin’ fame.  
  
⸻  
  
**Final Chorus (Strongest Yet)**  
  
We’re just gettin’ better, every day and every way,  
Learning how to bend, how not to break.  
Even in silence, we still pray—  
We’re just gettin’ better, every day and every way.  
  
⸻  
  
**Outro (Soft and Reflective)**  
  
Better every day…  
In every way…  
Seen by the light…  
That never fades.
