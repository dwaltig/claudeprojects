Lyrics:  (Verse 1)  
Woke up this mornin', stones at my door,  
Ignorant whispers cuttin' me to the core.  
Words like daggers, sharper than a knife,  
But I'll keep on walkin', through this weary life.  
  
(Verse 2)  
Hate in their eyes, a vicious, burnin' glare,  
Sticks and stones they throw, filled with despair.  
But my soul stands strong, ain't no fear in my stride,  
With every beat of my heart, courage deep inside.  
  
(Chorus)  
Bruises may fade, and the wounds may mend,  
But this spirit of mine, they'll never bend.  
Through storms and trials, I'll find my way,  
A smile on my face, at the break of day.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
(Verse 3)  
Venom they spit, with every bitter phrase,  
Tryin' to silence my voice, in a thousand ways.  
But their lies can't touch me, I hear truth's sweet call,  
Reachin' for the heavens, standin' tall.  
  
(Bridge)  
Slander like rain, washin' over me,  
Each drop a seed, plantin' a memory.  
From darkness I rise, with a soul brand new,  
Like a phoenix from ashes, bathed in morning dew.  
  
(Chorus)  
Bruises may fade, and the wounds may mend,  
But this spirit of mine, they'll never bend.  
Through storms and trials, I'll find my way,  
A smile on my face, at the break of day.
