# Unimaginable   
  
"'Unimaginable' explores that pivotal moment where belief in the Buddha's eternal lifespan and boundless merit transforms everything. This song is a meditation on how such profound faith makes spiritual regression unthinkable—truly unimaginable—offering a deep sense of peace and the assurance of 'Anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi' (Supreme Enlightenment).

Lyrics:  
**(Verse 1)**   
Woke up this mornin', sun was in the sky   
Got them worldly troubles, stackin' oh so high.   
Heard a sacred story, felt my spirit bloom   
But the dust of daily livin' filled up my room.  
  
**(Verse 2)**   
Thinkin' 'bout the Teacher, the one from long ago   
Sometimes I forget the seeds he came to sow.   
My mind gets clouded, caught up in the chase   
Lose that "right mind" feelin', stumble out of grace.  
  
**(Chorus)**   
But the Buddha told old Maitreya, hear it if you can   
**His life span is eternal, part of the master plan**.   
Believe it just a moment, understandin' deep inside   
**That merit's somethin' boundless, got nowhere to hide**.   
And **fallin' back? Unimaginable**, Lord, **unimaginable**.  
  
**(Verse 3)**   
Tried hard cultivation, practiced day by day   
Eight hundred thousand million kalpas on the way.   
But just that single notion, faith like a pure flame   
**Outshines all that effort, changes the whole game**.  
  
**(Verse 4)**   
Got to recollect Him, bring His light to mind   
**Recollect the Buddha, leave the blues behind**.   
Hear the Sangha speakin', voices strong and clear   
Remindin' one another, castin' out the fear.  
  
**(Chorus)**   
'Cause the Buddha told old Maitreya, hear it if you can   
**His life span is eternal, part of the master plan**.   
Believe it just a moment, understandin' deep inside   
**That merit's somethin' boundless, got nowhere to hide**.   
And **fallin' back? Unimaginable**, Lord, **unimaginable**.  
  
**(Bridge)**   
This road to Bodhi's bumpy, stretches out so far   
**Aiming for the highest, the supreme bright star**.   
But that moment's truth, that faith planted true   
**Guarantees the finish, gonna see it through**.  
  
**(Chorus)**   
Yeah, the Buddha told old Maitreya, hear it if you can   
**His life span is eternal, part of the master plan**.   
Believe it just a moment, understandin' deep inside   
**That merit's somethin' boundless, got nowhere to hide**.   
And **fallin' back? Unimaginable**, Lord, **unimaginable**.  
  
**(Outro)**   
Unimaginable...   
Can't fall back now... not from that **Supreme Enlightenment**.   
He's **ever-present**, leadin' us along Makin' our weak spirits strong.   
No, can't fall back...   
Not from **Anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi**...   
No, Lord, no....
