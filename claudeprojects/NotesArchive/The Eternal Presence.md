# The Eternal Presence  
  
I see you drowning in your pain,   
Adrift on suffering's endless sea.   
Though medicines for you remain,   
You turn away, refusing me.  
  
So from your sight I shall withdraw—   
A loving father's clever ploy.   
When presence fails to inspire awe,   
Perhaps my absence will employ  
  
A deeper longing in your heart,   
A recognition of what's lost.   
Sometimes the teacher must depart   
For students to count up the cost.  
  
The poison courses through your veins   
While remedy sits gathering dust.   
Yet when you think that nothing remains,   
You'll turn at last to what you must.  
  
I never truly leave your side   
Though eyes perceive an empty space.   
The truth I cannot help but hide   
Sometimes reveals my clearest face.  
  
For in the seeking you will find   
That I was present all along.   
The dharma, flowering in your mind,   
Transforms your suffering into song.  
  
So look for me in empty rooms   
And listen for me in the silence.   
It's there my truest teaching blooms—   
In your own heart's awakened guidance.
