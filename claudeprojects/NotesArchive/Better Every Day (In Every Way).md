Lyrics:   
Verse 1  
Woke up with the sunrise on my face,  
Another chance to try, another day of grace.  
A little more kind than I was before,  
Got a heart that’s open, and a soul that soars.  
  
Chorus  
We’re just gettin’ better, every day and every way,  
Step by step, come what may.  
Makin’ peace with yesterday,  
We’re just gettin’ better, every day and every way.  
  
Verse 2  
There’ve been droughts that cracked the soul,  
Days I felt I’d lost control.  
But still I dug down through the clay,  
Lookin’ for the truth to show the way.  
I walked through shadows just to learn,  
That even thirst can help us yearn.  
  
Chorus  
We’re just gettin’ better, every day and every way,  
Step by step, come what may.  
Makin’ peace with yesterday,  
We’re just gettin’ better, every day and every way.  
  
Bridge  
And the ones who’ve walked this road before,  
They guide my steps from distant shores.  
In every breath, in every fall,  
They whisper, “Child, you’ve heard the call.”  
  
Chorus  
We’re just gettin’ better, every day and every way,  
Learning how to bend, how not to break.  
Even in silence, we still pray—  
We’re just gettin’ better, every day and every way.  
  
Outro  
Better every day…  
In every way…  
Seen by the light…  
That never fades.
