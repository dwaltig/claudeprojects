# Treatise on Prayers  
  
Upon Sado's shores, by exile's stark decree,   
A promise etched for all humanity to see.   
No fragile hope, but **inevitable truth** profound,   
When prayer with Mystic Law's firm vow is crowned.  
  
Our lives, a **tarnished mirror**, veiled by dust and doubt,   
But **Daimoku's polish** brings our Buddha-nature out.   
A transformation deep, where inner strength takes hold,   
And inherent wisdom gleams, a story to unfold.  
  
As **sound meets echo**, certain, swift, and clear,   
So honest prayer dispels all lingering fear.   
Like **shadow follows body**, never left behind,   
Our actions and our prayers, their true reward will find.   
The **moon on calmest water**, a perfect, bright design,   
Reflects our pure intent, a clarity divine.  
  
As **magnet draws the iron**, with unwavering might,   
And **amber gathers dust**, transmuting dark to light.   
A **mirror collects dewdrops**, blessings softly accrue,   
When inner practice makes the hidden self anew.  
  
From **self-absorbed attachment**, prayers may dimly glow,   
But for **all beings' benefit**, the blessings freely flow.   
For **Kosen-rufu's spread**, our deepest vows are cast,   
Bringing **harmony to all**, a promise built to last.  
  
With **conviction burning**, and **determination's fire**,   
We meet each test as **fuel for higher, loftier desire**.   
Embracing **responsibility**, in life's tumultuous stream,   
**Transforming adversities**, a powerful, living dream.  
  
Thus, the "Treatise on Prayers," a testament so strong,   
An** assurance** where all fulfillments ever throng.   
Through **faith and active practice**, our spirits rise and grow,   
And **absolute happiness** manifests, a boundless, steady flow.
