# The Blooming Within  
  
Beneath the veil of thought’s domain, Where logic strives to rule the plain, A deeper voice begins to rise, Unseen by keen and searching eyes.  
  
No map can chart its boundless scope, No reason bind its thread of hope; It whispers soft, yet echoes strong, A timeless truth, a sacred song.  
  
The hands that grasp at books and lore, May find the key but not the door; For wisdom blooms where hearts unfold, Not in the pride of minds grown cold.  
  
Faith, the seed, through practice grows, Its roots in fertile stillness sows; And though the winds of doubt may shake, Its stem will bend, but never break.  
  
In acts of kindness, steps of grace, It finds its form, it takes its place; Not etched in words or clever schemes, But flowing through life’s hidden streams.  
  
Oh, seeker chasing mastery’s fire, Pause and feel your heart’s desire; For truths are not by conquest won, But known when the small and vast are one.  
  
So let the mind bow to the heart, And watch the walls of fear depart; In faith and practice, life begins— The lotus blooms, the light within.
