#  [Verse]  
Good folks keepin' the scroll, Lotus in their soul,  
Read it, recite it, the story untold,  
Incense burnin', flowers unfold,  
Garments and music, the truth's been sold.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Necklaces hang, banners fly high,  
Streamers twistin', reachin' the sky,  
Copy the phrase, don't question why,  
Hands come together, in Dharma we try.  
  
[Chorus]  
Respect earned, world turns,  
Dharma burns, wisdom churns,  
Every heart yearns, knowledge learns,  
Giving thanks, in life's turns.  
  
[Verse 3]  
Incense powder, skin feels the grace,  
Burnin' scents, sacred space,  
Canopies shield, honor in place,  
Bows down respectfully, truth we embrace.  
  
[Bridge]  
Join hands, unify,  
Worldwide eyes, we testify,  
Harmony cries, souls magnify,  
Lotus bloom, reachin' high.  
  
[Verse 4]  
Rituals deep, homage we pay,  
Scrolls pure, light our way,  
Every word a path to sway,  
Lotus love, here to stay.

[Chorus]  
Respect earned, world turns,  
Dharma burns, wisdom churns,  
Every heart yearns, knowledge learns,  
Giving thanks, in life's turns.
