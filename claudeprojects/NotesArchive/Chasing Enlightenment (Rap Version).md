[**Verse 1**] Walkin’ down these streets, chaos all around Dreams of wisdom got me feelin' like I’m bound Buddha’s light shinin’ way up in the sky I’m reachin' for it—won’t quit till I fly  
Every step, yeah, I stumble, but I rise again Every fall, another lesson, man, I learn within Streets keep twistin’, but I keep my aim What’s enlightenment if you ain’t faced the pain?  
  
[**Chorus/Hook**] Enlightenment so high, but I’m chasin’ it still Every move I make, yeah, it sharpens my will It’s a long ride, yeah, it’s full of bends But every fall’s just another way the spirit mends  
  
[**Verse 2**] I sit alone, silence in the air Underneath the tree, I’m just takin' in the care Whispers in the wind, like a melody Untyin' knots in my mind, I’m finally free  
Inner peace, yeah, I’m chasin' that too Through every struggle, man, you gotta push through Wisdom’s like the breeze, can’t see, but I feel Now I’m unlockin' doors, yeah, this mind’s for real  
  
[**Chorus/Hook**] Enlightenment so high, but I’m chasin’ it still Every move I make, yeah, it sharpens my will It’s a long ride, yeah, it’s full of bends But every fall’s just another way the spirit mends  
  
[**Bridge**] Through the dark nights, and the burnin’ heat Every setback, man, I’m stayin' on my feet Got lost in the maze, but I found my own way Keep runnin' for the light, yeah, I’m here to stay  
Every misstep, a lesson in disguise I keep my eyes on the prize till the sun rise Ain’t no limit to what you can achieve Just keep grindin' and you’ll see what you believe  
  
[**Verse 3**] Eyes closed, still searchin' inside Through the doubt, where the hope starts to rise Yeah, the path’s twisted, but it’s all worth while In every tear, there’s Buddha’s smile  
I walk the road, never lookin’ behind Cuz every step I take is a step in my mind Yeah, the climb’s hard, but I’m takin' it slow Cuz every fall is just fuel for the glow  
  
[**Chorus/Hook**] Enlightenment so high, but I’m chasin’ it still Every move I make, yeah, it sharpens my will It’s a long ride, yeah, it’s full of bends But every fall’s just another way the spirit mends
