**Lyrics:**  
(Verse 1)   
Lord, hear my cry, my soul's plea,   
Listen to my heart's melody.   
No lies on these lips, just truth I bring,   
Seeking justice, let your wisdom ring.  
  
(Chorus)   
Lotus blooms in the muddy stream,   
Vindication's light, a hopeful beam.   
Walk the Bodhisattva's path with me,   
Compassion's lamp, eternally.  
  
(Verse 2)   
Weigh my heart, Lord, in the still of night,   
Refine my spirit, burning pure and bright.   
No idle words, just teachings I embrace,   
Walking the path of truth and grace.  
  
(Chorus)   
Lotus blooms in the muddy stream,   
Vindication's light, a hopeful beam.   
Walk the Bodhisattva's path with me,   
Compassion's lamp, eternally.  
  
(Reprise Verse 2)   
Weigh my heart, Lord, in the still of night,   
Refine my spirit, burning pure and bright.   
No idle words, just teachings I embrace,   
Walking the path of truth and grace.  
  
(Verse 3)   
Shadows gather, malice fills the air,   
But I'll find refuge in your tender care.   
Keep me safe, beneath your sheltering wing,   
From darkness' grasp, let freedom ring.  
  
(Chorus)   
Lotus blooms in the muddy stream,   
Vindication's light, a hopeful beam.   
Walk the Bodhisattva's path with me,   
Compassion's lamp, eternally.  
  
(Bridge)   
Worldly treasures fade and disappear,   
But in your light, my heart finds cheer.   
When karma's veil lifts, I'll see your face,   
Bathed in the Lotus Sutra's grace.  
  
(Reprise Bridge)   
Worldly treasures fade and disappear,   
But in your light, my heart finds cheer.   
When karma's veil lifts, I'll see your face,   
Bathed in the Lotus Sutra's grace.  
  
(Chorus)   
Lotus blooms in the muddy stream,   
Vindication's light, a hopeful beam.   
Walk the Bodhisattva's path with me,   
Compassion's lamp, eternally.  
  
Lotus Blooms forever free,  
In your boundless love, eternally.
