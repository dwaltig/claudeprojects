Lyrics:  
I heard the call of wisdom, like a river runnin’ deep,  
Said the truth is in the silence, but the climb ain't for the weak.  
Every soul’s a treasure, hidden under life's decay,  
Beneath the dust, there's gold inside — that's the Buddha way.  
  
Oh, the path is open, the light is shining through,  
It don’t matter where you're standin’, the Dharma’s calling you.  
We’re all walkin’ home together, every step a prayer to start,  
When we lift each other higher, we awaken heart to heart.  
  
I once thought I was forgotten, just another voice unheard,  
Buried in the shadows, holdin' broken dreams deferred.  
But then the Lotus whispered, "Child, you were born to be free.  
The spark inside your darkness is the light of eternity."  
  
Oh, the path is open, the light is shining through,  
It don’t matter where you're standin’, the Dharma’s calling you.  
We’re bound by love unshaken, in the web of all that lives,  
To live for more than just ourselves is the greatest gift to give.  
  
I met a wanderer on the open road,  
With kindness in her eyes and a heavy load.  
She said, “Child, don’t you see? Your pain’s not just your own.  
But a thread in the quilt of this world we call home.  
  
“So, rise up when you stumble, walk on when you fall,  
The Lotus blooms in the muddiest waters of all.  
This life ain’t just a journey — it’s the start of a flame.  
Light the torch for all others and remember their names.”  
  
Never doubt that you’re worthy, never think you’re too small,  
The seed of enlightenment is alive in us all.  
So sing it for the children, for the lost and the free,  
We’ll build a world of compassion, from sea to shining sea!
