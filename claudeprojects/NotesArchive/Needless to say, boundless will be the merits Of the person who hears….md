*Needless to say, boundless will be the merits Of the person who hears this sutra with all his heart, And expounds its meanings, And acts according to its teachings.*  
*Needless to say, boundless will be the merits Of the person who hears this sutra with all his heart, And expounds its meanings, And acts according to its teachings.*  
The Buddha sings these verses to Maitreya (whom he calls Ajita–invincible) in Chapter Eighteen of the Lotus Sutra. The merits we gain through our study and practice of the Lotus Sūtra do not make us better than any of the other beings with whom we share this world. Merits accumulate when we strip away our delusions and see the world for what it is. We sometimes focus on what we can do to change the world, thinking that merely changing how we look at the world will have little effect. It is only when we see things for what they are that we can act effectively. Otherwise, we are merely reinforcing the delusions of ourselves and others.
