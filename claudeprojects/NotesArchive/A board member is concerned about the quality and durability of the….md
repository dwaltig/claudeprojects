A board member is concerned about the quality and durability of the west fence, particularly the posts that are supported by additional boards.  
It’s suggested we have a professional inspection and inquire  about warranties.  
  
I talked to Victor and got his professional opinion. I’m told to do a shack test of the North Fence vs the West Fence.
