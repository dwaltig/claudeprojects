Originally from Italy, Alessandro Valignano became a Jesuit priest in 1566 and was sent as a missionary to Japan. Seeking to accommodate the Japanese culture, he encouraged his priests to dress like Zen Buddhist monks and stressed the importance of their fluency in the language. He also arranged for the Jesuit mission to receive a portion of the highly profitable silk trade. This made the mission self-supporting and helped convert several powerful feudal lords. Valignano was highly esteemed among the Japanese and was formally received by two successive rulers of Japan. He was even permitted to train native priests, the importance of which he learned from St. Francis Xavier. In 1582 he sent four young Japanese Christian samurai to Rome in what was the first Japanese diplomatic mission to Europe. The foreign guests were lavishly entertained by the king of Spain, were received by the pope, and even had paintings done by Tintoretto. By the time of his death, there were an estimated 300,000 Christians and 116 Jesuits in the country. However, in the 17th century, Christianity in Japan was met with heavy persecution, and thousands of Christians were martyred.
