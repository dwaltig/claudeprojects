# Fire in the Stone  
  
**“Fire in the Stone”** is a soulful blues folk meditation on hidden potential and the quiet presence of awakening within our daily lives. Inspired by Nichiren’s teachings on the Mutual Possession of the Ten Realms and the Lotus Sutra’s promise of universal Buddhahood, this song brings ancient wisdom into an earthy, intimate soundscape. Through images of rocks sparking, trees blooming, and the Buddha walking quietly within us all, “Fire in the Stone” reminds us that even in dark and cold moments, the light of enlightenment is waiting to be revealed. Simple, raw, and heartfelt, this track offers comfort and hope to seekers everywhere.

[Verse 1]  
I struck two stones in the midnight cold,  
No light ’round me, no hand to hold.  
But a spark leapt free from the heavy gloom—  
Whispered soft, “Child, there’s fire in the stone.”  
  
[Verse 2]  
I passed a tree that winter forgot,  
Barren and brittle, life seemed lost.  
But come the spring, it bloomed so wide—  
“Child,” it sang, “there’s a blossom inside.”  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, fire in the stone, bloom in the wood,  
Buddha in the tears, in the blood, in the mud.  
Hard to believe, harder to see,  
But the Buddha walks quiet, deep in you and me.  
  
[Bridge - optional slow breakdown]  
Like water in fire, or a flame in the sea,  
This Dharma hides softly, where hurt used to be.  
  
[Chorus repeat]  
Yeah, fire in the stone, bloom in the wood,  
Buddha in the cry, in the dark misunderstood.  
Hard to believe, but it’s true as can be,  
The Buddha walks gentle, deep in you and me.
