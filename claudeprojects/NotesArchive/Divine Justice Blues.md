[Verse 1]  
In the morning light, I lift my voice,  
With all my heart, I make my choice.  
To sing the praises of the One Most High,  
For the deeds that never fade, never die.  
  
[Chorus]  
Divine justice, rolling down the line,  
From Zion's gates to the end of time.  
In every heart that seeks the truth,  
Find refuge in this sacred blues.  
  
[Verse 2]  
My enemies, they turn and flee,  
For righteousness, you fight for me.  
Sitting high on your righteous throne,  
Judging all, both flesh and bone.  
  
[Instrumental  
  
[Bridge]  
In the Lotus bloom, I find my peace,  
Avalokiteshvara brings sweet release.  
With Dionysian joy, I dance and sing,  
In the circle of life, we feel the swing.  
  
[Verse 3]  
You’ve rebuked the nations, cast them down,  
In endless ruin, they wear no crown.  
But those who seek, you never forsake,  
In your name, all chains we break.  
  
[Chorus]  
Divine justice, rolling down the line,  
From Zion's gates to the end of time.  
In every heart that seeks the truth,  
Find refuge in this sacred blues.  
  
[Verse 4]  
In the vineyards of the joyous god,  
I dance away from sorrow's rod.  
With wine and song, we celebrate,  
In the refuge of love, we find our fate.  
  
[Outro]  
So rise, oh Lord, and show your might,  
Let the nations see the light.  
Strike with truth, let justice ring,  
In this blues, to you we cling.

[Reprise]  
In the morning light, I lift my voice,  
With all my heart, I make my choice.  
To sing the praises of the One Most High,  
For the deeds that never fade, never die.  
For the deeds that never fade, never die.  
  
In the Lotus bloom, I find my peace,  
Avalokiteshvara brings sweet release.  
With Dionysian joy, I dance and sing,  
In the circle of life, we feel the swing.  
  
You’ve rebuked the nations, cast them down,  
In endless ruin, they wear no crown.  
But those who seek, you never forsake,  
In your name, all chains we break.  
In your name, all chains we break.  
  
You’ve rebuked the nations, cast them down,  
In endless ruin, they wear no crown.  
But those who seek, you never forsake,  
In your name, all chains we break.  
In your name, all chains we break.
