[Intro]  
  
Verse 1  
In the quiet of the dawn,   
he rose from meditation,  
Fully aware,   
with a heart of dedication,  
He spoke to Șāriputra,   
words so profound,  
The wisdom of a Buddha,   
in silence found.  
  
Chorus  
Oh, the wisdom of the Thus Come Ones,   
so deep and wide,  
It's a journey through the ages,   
with nothing to hide,  
From countless eons,   
they’ve walked the way,  
To supreme enlightenment,   
they humbly pray.  
  
Verse 2  
With skillful means,   
they liberate the soul,  
Attached to views,   
they make the broken whole,  
Their knowledge,   
like rivers,   
flow without end,  
Only a Thus Come One,   
their truth can comprehend.  
  
Chorus  
Oh, the wisdom of the Thus Come Ones,   
so deep and wide,  
It's a journey through the ages,   
with nothing to hide,  
From countless eons,   
they’ve walked the way,  
To supreme enlightenment,   
they humbly pray.  
they humbly pray.

[Instrumental]  
  
Bridge  
In realms of gods and men,   
heroes are found,  
But their mysteries lie   
deep in the ground,  
Only the Bodhisattvas,   
with hearts so strong,  
Can fathom the depths,   
where the wise belong.  
  
Verse 3  
Disciples and Hermits,   
they reach for the skies,  
But Buddha’s knowledge   
is beyond their eyes,  
Even the stars,   
in their distant gleam,  
Can’t match the wisdom   
that shines in the dream.  
  
Chorus  
Oh, the wisdom of the Thus Come Ones,   
so deep and wide,  
It's a journey through the ages,   
with nothing to hide,  
From countless eons,   
they’ve walked the way,  
To supreme enlightenment,   
they humbly pray.  
  
Outro  
With compassion and love,   
they guide the lost,  
Through the threefold path,   
no matter the cost,  
The teachings of the Thus Come Ones,   
diverse and grand,  
Are the keys to freedom,   
across the land.
