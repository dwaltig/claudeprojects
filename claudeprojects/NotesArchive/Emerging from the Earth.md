# Emerging from the Earth  
## (Blues-Folk-Gospel Fusion)  
**[Verse 1]** *[Style: Intimate Delta blues-folk. Solo fingerpicked acoustic guitar (Travis picking pattern). Vocal raw and close, like Mississippi John Hurt or early Odetta. No percussion. Slide guitar quietly weeps in the background.]*  
We gathered in the Ceremony in the Air From countless other worlds, we traveled there We saw the suffering in this sahā land And raised a compassionate and helping hand We made a vow, "After you're gone, we will remain Through the perilous age of sorrow and of pain We will protect and preach this Sūtra true" It was the noblest thing that we could do.  
*[Harmonica plaintive note holds...]*  
  
**[Pre-Chorus]** *[Style: Electric blues enters. Walking bass line climbs up. Harmonica swells and bends blue notes. Hammond B3 organ begins to hum underneath. Rhythm is swung, bluesy. Snare brush taps enter subtly.]*  
But the World-Honored One just smiled and shook his head "Your help is not required here," he softly said "Don't you worry for this world of mine This world of suffering can heal its own There's a seed of power in the sorrow sown."  
*[Electric guitar bends a blue note upward...]*  
  
**[Chorus]** *[Style: EXPLOSION - Full gospel-blues-folk fusion. Gospel choir erupts with force. Electric blues guitar plays stinging licks. Banjo adds driving rhythm. Full drum kit with tambourine and handclaps. Think Mahalia Jackson meets Sister Rosetta Tharpe meets Pete Seeger's Hootenanny.]*  
And then the ground began to tremble and to break! The earth tore open, for this world's own sake And from the very soil of suffering and doubt A million golden heroes started welling out! And the truth just hit me, like a thunder sound The greatest hero isn't from the clouds The hero is right here, rooted in the ground. I don't need a savior; the power's in me now!  
*[Blues guitar lick answers the vocal line. Banjo rolls.]*  
  
**[Verse 2]** *[Style: Full band continues but with more space. Acoustic and electric guitars intertwine. Fiddle adds Appalachian-style countermelody. Gospel organ supports but doesn't dominate. Folk-blues groove - earthy and grounded.]*  
More countless than the sands along the Ganges streams They rose up like the substance of our deepest dreams With golden bodies, shining with a brilliant light With all the marks of greatness, shinin' in the light Led by Superior Practices, the chief and first They'd been waiting for the proper time to burst Not from some distant land, but right beneath our feet The ones to make this broken, bitter world complete.  
*[Fiddle dances, harmonica answers]*  
  
**[Pre-Chorus]** *[Style: Dynamic dip into blues ballad territory. Band pulls back. Electric guitar plays sparse, soulful fills. Bass walks slow blues progression. Organ swells gently.]*  
And the Buddha said, "Behold, these are my sons The ones I've taught since time itself begun They are my disciples from the remotest past." A holy paradox, too deep and vast...  
*[Tension builds with organ swell and drum roll...]*  
  
**[Chorus]** *[Style: BIGGER second chorus. Everything louder and more joyous. Choir is in full voice. Blues guitar solos over the top. Banjo and mandolin driving hard. Tambourine shaking. Call-and-response between lead and choir.]*  
And the ground began to tremble and to break! The earth tore open, for this world's own sake And from the very soil of suffering and doubt A million golden heroes started welling out! And the truth just hit me, like a thunder sound The greatest hero isn't from the clouds The hero is right here, rooted in the ground. I don't need a savior; the power's in me now!  
*[Band hits a power chord and STOPS. Sudden silence...]*  
  
**[Bridge - Spoken Word/Blues Testimony]** *[Style: Stripped to bare essentials - just acoustic guitar playing 12-bar blues progression, with piano adding sparse gospel chords. Lead vocal is half-sung, half-spoken, like a folk storyteller or blues testifier. Intimate, raw, vulnerable.]*  
*(Spoken-sung with blues phrasing):* Even Maitreya, the "Invincible" one He had to ask, "My Lord, how could this be done? You've only taught for forty-some-odd years How did you raise this host that calms all fears?"  
*(Building slightly):* His question was the key that opened up the door To make the walls of history and logic fall  
*(Intensity rising, approaching singing):* This is the mission for this final, broken age When mappō's darkness covers up the page We are the ones who chose to be right here To transform destiny and conquer every fear.  
*[Harmonica cries out. Drums begin to build. Band prepares to explode...]*  
  
**[Outro / Vamp]** *[Style: Joyous folk-gospel hootenanny meets blues party. Everyone is invited to join. Hand claps, foot stomps, tambourine shaking. Banjo rolls continuously. Call-and-response between lead and congregation. Energy is communal and celebratory.]*  
And Nichiren said, "Listen! This is emerging from the earth!" Every time one person finds their sacred worth When first one chants, then two, and then a hundred more This is the army welling up from the planet's floor!  
This is the work we do! This is our vow! Transforming the sahā world, right here and now!  
  
**[Folk-Blues Collective Chant - Call and Response]** *[Style: Group sing-along. Lead calls, everyone responds. Building to ecstatic release. Blues guitar wails overhead. Banjo never stops.]*  
**LEAD:** We are the earth! **ALL:** (We are the earth!) **LEAD:** We are the ground! **ALL:** (We are the ground!) **LEAD:** The seed was planted! **ALL:** (The seed was planted!) **LEAD:** Now we're breaking out! **ALL:** (Now we're breaking out!)  
  
**[Ad-lib Vamp - Fading]** *[Style: Choir and lead vocal trade ad-libs over the chord progression. Blues guitar takes a final solo. Harmonica wails. The music slowly fades as if the celebration continues beyond what we can hear. The last sound is a lone acoustic guitar playing the opening Travis-picking pattern, bringing it full circle.]*  
We are the ones! *(Welling up! Welling up!)* From the ground! *(From the ground!)* The power's in me now! *(Power's in me now!)* The hero's in the ground... *(Hero's in the ground...)*  
*[Blues guitar bends a final blue note]* *[Harmonica sighs]* *[Solo acoustic guitar returns to the opening folk pattern]* *[Fade to silence]*
