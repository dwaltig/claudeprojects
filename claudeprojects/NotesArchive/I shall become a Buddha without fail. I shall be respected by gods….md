*I shall become a Buddha without fail. I shall be respected by gods and men. I will turn the wheel of the unsurpassed Dharma, And teach Bodhisattvas.*  
  
These verses are spoken by Śāriputra, regarded as the wisest of the Buddha’s disciples, at the beginning of Chapter Three of the Lotus Sutra. His words come not from conceit, but from joy. How does our view of the problems in the world change when we have the assurance that we will become Buddhas? How does our view of others change when we know that they too will become Buddhas? For one thing, we might spend less effort demanding respect and more giving respect.
