# The Skillful Physician’s Blues  
(A slow, weary acoustic guitar riff in A minor)  
## Verse 1 (The Illness and Refusal)  
We were poisoned, Lord, a virulent kind. It left us deranged, sick deep in the mind. Writhing on the cold ground, agony was all we knew. There was a good doctor, wise and compassionate, but he rode out of view.  
He came back with medicine, perfect scent and color and flavor. Said, "Children, take this cup, I am your compassionate savior". But the venom ran so deep, our eyes refused to see. We saw that **excellent medicine** and cried, "This potion ain't for me!" We thought the cure was bad, and we refused to take it. Oh, our minds were so confused, that poison made us forsake it.  
## Chorus (The Ruse of Death)  
He went away and he traveled to another land. Then the messenger came, a note held tight in his hand. Said, "The Doctor is dead, the protector is gone". **I am orphaned and alone**, waiting for the dawn. That was the ultimate therapeutic shock, the grief cut me to the bone. He staged that whole death just to make me **thirst for him** and moan.  
## Verse 2 (Grief and Awakening)  
I was shocked and grief-stricken, overcome with despair. Thought, "If he were here, we’d have a protector and care". That profound, bitter loss, it stirred the fog in my head. If he were truly gone, then everything good was dead.  
The delusion started lifting, the agony eased. My mind opened up, though my weary spirit was unpleased. I looked at that bitter cup, standing right where he left it. Saw the medicine’s true quality, and finally I wept and I accepted.  
## Chorus (The Ruse of Death)  
He went away and he traveled to another land. Then the messenger came, a note held tight in his hand. Said, "The Doctor is dead, the protector is gone". **I am orphaned and alone**, waiting for the dawn. That was the ultimate therapeutic shock, the grief cut me to the bone. He staged that whole death just to make me thirst for him and moan.  
## Bridge (*Upāya* - Skill in Means)  
Some might call it a lie, a **supreme deceit**. But he saved us through sorrow, making the poison retreat. The Buddha is the Father of this world, saving those afflicted by pain. He said, "Though in fact alive, I gave out word I was slain". He meant to prevent us from becoming arrogant and complacent. He used his **Skill in Means** (*upāya*) to pull us from our ancient descent.  
## Outro  
The shock is over now, the healing done. The Father came back, beneath the rising sun. He was alive all along, teaching for many hundreds of thousands of billions of *nayutas* of *kalpas*. And the poison that bound me... it ain't got no power. No, the poison that bound me... it ain't got no power now. (Fade out on guitar)
