Lyrics:   
(Verse 1)  
Yo, check the mic, one two, world in my view  
Sensory overload, what's real, what's true?  
Touch, taste, smell, the data streams in  
Gotta decode the signal, where do I begin?  
From the jump street, chaos reigns supreme  
A tangled web of info, a waking dream  
But the mind's a forge, heatin' up the steel  
Annealing the knowledge, makin' the abstract real.  
  
(Chorus)  
Curiously discover, that's the motto, yo  
Seekin' truth and wisdom, watch the knowledge grow  
From the ashes of confusion, order takes its flight  
Igniting the mind, burnin' ever so bright.  
  
(Verse 2)  
Words of the elders, stories they impart  
Ancient wisdom etched upon the heart  
From dusty scrolls to whispers in the breeze  
Plantin' seeds of knowledge, if you please  
Intuition's whisper, a gut feeling deep  
Beyond the logic, secrets that it keeps  
But gotta be wary, illusions in the mix  
Gotta sift the truth, avoid the cunning tricks.  
  
(Chorus)  
Curiously discover, that's the motto, yo  
Seekin' truth and wisdom, watch the knowledge grow  
From the ashes of confusion, order takes its flight  
Igniting the mind, burnin' ever so bright.  
  
(Bridge)  
The path ain't easy, doubts will creep in  
But keep on pushin', let the journey begin  
Question everything, challenge every claim  
Knowledge is a fire, fuelin' the flame.  
  
(Chorus)  
Curiously discover, that's the motto, yo  
Seekin' truth and wisdom, watch the knowledge grow  
From the ashes of confusion, order takes its flight  
Igniting the mind, burnin' ever so bright.  
  
(Outro)  
Yeah, keep on searchin', never stop explorin'  
Curiously discover, 'til the truth is dawnin'. Word.
