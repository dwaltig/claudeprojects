Dear friends, I understand your reservations about attending the meeting, and I want to assure you that your participation, whether in person or by proxy, is highly valuable. Signing a proxy allows you to have a say in the meeting's outcomes and ensures your voice is heard, even if you choose not to attend physically.

Please know that using a proxy is a legitimate means of participation used by members around the world and is fully supported by our by-laws. It is your right as a member to use a proxy, and doing so contributes to the diversity of opinions and decision-making that makes our board effective. It doesn't lessen the significance of your role; on the contrary, it reinforces it.  
Also, the use of proxies doesn't inflate attendance figures dishonestly; it simply ensures that all members' perspectives are considered, regardless of their ability to attend. This reflects a full and fair representation of the member’s views, not a manipulation of numbers. I encourage you to exercise your right to vote via proxy and stay involved in our collective efforts to govern effectively.  
If you have any concerns about the process or need assistance in assigning your proxy, I'm here to assist you. We're committed to transparency and inclusivity, and I'll make sure that your participation through proxy is recorded and respected just as if you were present.
