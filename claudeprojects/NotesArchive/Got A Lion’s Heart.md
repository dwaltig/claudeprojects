**[Verse 1]**  
Got a lion’s heart, fire in the chest,  
Ashes rise, we don’t settle for less,  
No chains, no locks, no prison walls,  
We stand tall, rise up, we won’t fall.  
Life’s a game, but we playing to win,  
Tried to hold us down, nah, not again.  
We break the mold, never be the same,  
We were born to win, this ain’t no game.  
  
**[Verse 2]**  
Dust on my kicks, dreams in the veins,  
Road been tough, but we break the chains,  
Through every trial, every ounce of pain,  
Look in my eyes, yo, we rise again.  
Ain’t no quit, just push till we break through,  
Look at the scars—proof of what we do.  
You feel the grind? That’s where it begins,  
‘Cause deep down inside, we were born to win.

We born to win, can’t you see the truth?  
Riding storms, just me and you.  
Feel the beat, let it burn within,

Yeah, born to win, see it in our eyes,  
Fight through the struggle, no disguise.  
With every step, we don’t give in,  
‘Cause honey, yeah, we were born to win.

Dark nights, but the heart shines bright,

Caught in the blues, but that’s just a phase,  
Through thunder and rain, we finding our way.  
Ain’t no regrets, nah, we in it to gain,  
Breaking the mold, walking out of the pain.  
Ain’t no stopping, no fear in my stride,

Guitar’s crying like a wolf in the night,  
Soul’s howlin’, ain’t giving up the fight.  
This life’s a spin, but we play to win,  
Heads held high, never giving in.  
Yeah, in this dance, we stand and spin,  
You feel the fire? We born to win.

We born to win, can’t you see the truth?  
Riding storms, just me and you.  
Feel the beat, let it burn within,

Yeah, born to win, see it in our eyes,  
Fight through the struggle, no disguise.
