[Verse 1]  
On a moonlit night, by a sacred tree,  
Buddha was born, just like the scriptures decree.  
Lotus blooms in the garden, petals soft and white,  
A beacon of hope, shining through the night.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, the lotus blooms on Buddha's day,  
In a quiet temple, where the candles sway.  
Wisdom flows like a river, deep and wide,  
Guiding lost souls to the other side.  
  
[Verse 2]  
He walked the dusty roads, compassion in his eyes,  
Teaching love and kindness, under open skies.  
Monks and beggars gathered, seeking peace and truth,  
While the lotus bloomed silently, like an endless youth.  
  
[Bridge]  
In the shade of Bodhi, he found his meditation,  
Seeking answers to life's endless questions.  
Lotus whispered secrets, rooted in the mud,  
As he reached enlightenment, rising above the flood.  
  
[chorus]  
Oh, the lotus blooms on Buddha's day,  
In the quiet temple, where the candles sway.  
His wisdom like the river, flowing deep and wide,  
Guiding lost souls to the other side.  
  
[verse 3]  
Now temples stand tall, incense rising high,  
Bells chime in reverence, under the azure sky.  
The lotus still blooms, a symbol of purity,  
As we celebrate the Buddha's birth, with hearts full of glee.  
  
[chorus]  
Oh, the lotus blooms on Buddha's day,  
In the quiet temple, where the candles sway.  
His wisdom like the river, flowing deep and wide,  
Guiding lost souls to the other side.  
  
[Outro]  
With his teachings, we find our way   
In his wisdom, we never stray   
Buddha's birth, a timeless ray   
Guiding us every day   
  
[End]  
[Fades to End]  
  
His wisdom like the river, flowing deep and wide,  
Guiding lost souls to the other side.  
  
[Outro]  
With his teachings, we find our way   
In his wisdom, we never stray   
Buddha's birth, a timeless ray   
Guiding us every day   
  
[End]  
[Fades to End]
