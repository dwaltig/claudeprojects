# Lotus Bloom  
  
[Verse 1]  
In the heart’s depth, a seed lies still,    
Shrouded in darkness, against its will.    
Whispers of rain, soft and low—    
Promises made, to help it grow.  
  
[Chorus]  
Awakening bloom, rise so high,    
From the mud to the open sky.    
A lotus pure, above it all,    
In your bloom, we heed the call.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Stirring gentle, a force unseen,    
A beacon bright, where none has been.    
From the depths to the light above,    
A journey fueled by purest love.  
  
[Chorus]  
Awakening bloom, rise so high,    
From the mud to the open sky.    
A lotus pure, above it all,    
In your bloom, we heed the call.  
  
[Chorus]  
Awakening bloom, rise so high,    
From the mud to the open sky.    
A lotus pure, above it all,    
In your bloom, we heed the call.  
  
[Bridge]  
Each being a lotus, with dreams so vast,    
Bound by shadows that the past has cast.    
Yet guided by a sutra’s light,    
We stride toward a day so bright.  
. . . day so bright.  
. . . day so bright.  
. . . day so bright.  
. . . day so bright.  
  
[Verse 3]  
Petals spread, wisdom to share,    
An open prayer, floating in the air.    
For love, for peace, let it reign—    
Our Buddha nature, we reclaim.  
  
[Chorus]  
Awakening bloom, rise so high,    
From the mud to the open sky.    
A lotus pure, above it all,    
In your bloom, we heed the call.  
  
[Chorus]  
Awakening bloom, rise so high,    
From the mud to the open sky.    
A lotus pure, above it all,    
In your bloom, we heed the call.
