# The Lotus Sūtra’s Call  
  
From ancient scrolls, a truth profound and deep,  
The Lotus Sūtra, where all futures sleep.  
The Wonderful Dharma, *Myōhō* bright and true,  
Reveals Buddhahood resides in me and you.  
  
The One Vehicle—*Ekayāna’s* might—  
Unifies all beings toward awakening’s light.  
This world, a burning house, distractions lure,  
By doubt and desire, we stumble unsure.  
  
Sloth, ill will, restlessness cloud the way,  
Lost in illusions, blind to decay.  
These inner trials, hidden and deep,  
Obscure the clarity the mind must keep.  
  
Yet hear the call: “To those who strive!”  
With Vīrya’s joy, the spirit’s drive.  
Glad engagement, steadfast and clear,  
Cast off fear, and shun all lazy cheer.  
  
“Who hold compassion, vast and wide,  
Where boundless Karunā will not hide—  
Empathy flowing for every pain,  
Breaking walls, uniting again.”  
  
“And who do not spare their lives,” profound—  
From ego’s grasp, true self is unbound.  
Casting off ‘lesser’ self to embrace the whole,  
Finding self’s benefit in others’ soul.  
  
Like lotus blooms from muddy earth,  
Pure and unstained, a sacred birth.  
Inherent purity arises anew,  
The greater self revealed and true.  
  
Śāriputra’s doubts have all withdrawn,  
Buddhahood’s seed wakes with the dawn.  
This path, interconnected and bright,  
Transforms all suffering to boundless light.  
  
Through skillful means (*Upāya*), the Buddha guides,  
Universal awakening in all that abides.  
Embrace this journey, courageous and kind,  
Toward Buddhahood’s light, the truth to find.
