# The Tower in the Ground  
### Bluesy Folk / Gospel Blues  
  
[Spoken Intro, slow gravelly voice—Spoken intro ("*Sometimes the truth...*") over the acoustic E-chord vamp. A single, mournful slide note leads into the verse.]   
  
*Sometimes the truth ain't in the sky.* *Sometimes... you gotta look right down, in the dirt and the dust.* *Listen now...*  
  
[Verse 1—Sparse. Only Lead Vocal + Acoustic Guitar. Let the story set the scene.]   
(A) We was sittin' on that Vulture Peak, just listenin' to the Word,   
(A) Yeah, up on Vulture Peak, hearin' the best news we ever heard.   
(B) But our feet were on the hard-packed earth, in this world of hurt.  
  
[Verse 2–Upright Bass and soft Kick Drum enter. The "rumble" begins, building tension.]  
(A) Then the whole wide world began to shake, with a rumble and a groan,   
(A) Oh, the whole wide world began to shake, right down to the bone.   
(B) And the ground, it split right open, but it wasn't fire and stone.  
  
[Chorus--Resonator (Slide) enters with its main melodic hook. Backing Vocals swell *very* subtly. The song opens up.]  
(C) Oh, the Treasure Tower, (Lord) the Treasure Tower,   
(D) Risin' up from the common ground.   
(C) Oh, the Treasure Tower, showin' us its power,   
(D) It’s the proof of the truth we’d found.   
(C) It wasn't built by hands, it ain't no king's design,   
(D) It’s the Buddha-truth that’s sleepin' in your heart... and in mine.  
  
[Verse 3–Full groove is established. The Resonator plays call-and-response with the lead vocal phrases.]  
(A) It was shinin' bright with seven jewels, five hundred *yojanas* high,   
(A) Yeah, seven kinds of treasure, five hundred *yojanas* to the sky.   
(B) And a voice inside said, "What you preach is the truth, and that's no lie."  
  
[Verse 4—Full groove is established. The Resonator plays call-and-response with the lead vocal phrases.]  
(A) The Buddha, he just smiled and he opened up the door,   
(A) Yeah, he pulled that big door open, for the wealthy and the poor.   
(B) And an ancient Buddha sat inside, who’d been "gone" forevermore.  
  
[Verse 5—Full groove is established. The Resonator plays call-and-response with the lead vocal phrases.]  
(A) The ancient one was the Eternal, the timeless, holy law,   
(A) The one right here was History, the truest friend we ever saw.   
(B) And they sat down on the same throne, together, and we stared in awe.  
  
[Chorus—This is the first big "lift." The Tambourine enters. The Backing Vocals are clearer and more present.]   
(C) Oh, the Treasure Tower, (Lord) the Treasure Tower,   
(D) Risin' up from the common ground.   
(C) Oh, the Treasure Tower, showin' us its power,   
(D) It’s the proof of the truth we’d found.   
(C) It wasn't built by hands, it ain't no king's design,   
(D) It’s the Buddha-truth that’s sleepin' in your heart... and in mine.  
  
Bridge—The emotional peak. The Lead Vocal becomes more impassioned. All instruments swell. The backing vocals sing "oooh" with more volume, and the slide guitar holds a high, sustained note.]   
(E) Then he looked at all the people, the high and the low,   
(F) Said, "There's only one true vehicle, one road for you to go."   
(E) And he raised us to the sky, every single soul,   
(F) To show us that our broken lives... could be perfectly whole.  
  
[Verse 6—Pull back *slightly*. The kick and bass remain, but the energy becomes more intimate, focused on the lyric ("*you gotta be the tower*”).]  
(A) He said, "This truth is hard to carry, in a world so full of doubt,"   
(A) "Yeah, this Mystic Law is hard to hold, when you're down and out."   
(B) "But you gotta be the tower, and you gotta let your own light out."  
  
[Chorus / Outro—Full energy. Lead vocal ad-libs "it is you, it is me" (as written). Backing vocals ad-lib "risin' up, risin' up" very softly.]  
(C) Oh, the Treasure Tower, (Lord) the Treasure Tower,   
(D) Risin' up from the common ground.   
(C) Oh, the Treasure Tower, showin' us its power,   
(D) Don't you let 'em keep it down.   
(C) It ain't no distant story, it ain't no fantasy...   
(D) That Treasure Tower, brother... it is you. And it is me.  
  
[Spoken, slow fade—Song fades on the acoustic vamp and a final, long, ascending slide note. The final spoken words ("*Yeah... right down in the dirt...*") are delivered as the music fades out.]  
*Yeah... right down in the dirt. *  
*Right down in the hurt. *  
*That's where you'll find it...*   
*Just waiting to rise...*
