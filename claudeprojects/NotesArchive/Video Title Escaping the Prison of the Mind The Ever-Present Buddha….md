**Video Title: Escaping the Prison of the Mind: The Ever-Present Buddha & The Triple World**  
In this video, we explore a radical teaching from Chapter Seven of the **Lotus Sūtra** that flips our concept of freedom on its head. We dive into the profound story of the **Brahma Heavenly-Kings**, powerful beings who sacrificed their kingdoms, subjects, and celestial homes to travel across worlds just to hear the "Wonderful Dharma". Their devotion points to a life-changing secret: **liberation isn't something you have to go out and find, but something you simply have to notice**.  
Join us as we unpack the Buddhist concept of the **"prison of the triple world,"** which is not a physical place, but a map of our own inner experience. This video breaks down the three layers of this mental prison:  
* **The World of Desire:** Where we are constantly chasing after wants.  
* **The World of Form:** Where we are attached to physical things and our bodies.  
* **The World of Formless:** Where we get trapped in abstract ideas and daydreams.  
We discover that this prison is built and held together entirely by our own **delusions, fears, and mistaken beliefs**. The key to unlocking it lies in the concept of the **Ever-Present Buddha**. Rather than a distant historical figure, the Buddha is presented as a living reality woven into every single moment.  
By making the conscious choice to let go of our mental stories and recognizing the enlightened nature already present, the prison bars dissolve. This shift in perception reveals that we are not trapped, but are actually standing in the **Buddha’s Pure Land** right now.  
**Think of it like waking up from a nightmare:** The monster chasing you seemed incredibly real, and your fear was genuine, but the moment you open your eyes and recognize your true surroundings, the threat doesn't need to be fought or destroyed—it simply vanishes because it was never really there.
