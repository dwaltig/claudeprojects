# The Living Sutra  
  
Not by voice alone, nor thought confined,  
Do Lotus truths truly humankind  
Embrace and master, pure and bright,  
But by a life lived, bathed in light.  
No silent page, no chanted phrase,  
Compares to walking wisdom’s ways.  
  
To read the Sutra with the body’s core,  
Means Śākyamuni at your door,  
A living presence, breath and grace,  
Reflected in your time and space.  
The three-thousand realms, a single thought,  
In Nam-myoho-renge-kyo are wrought.  
Each act, each moment, now unfurled,  
A vibrant, living, cosmic world.  
  
For not abstract, nor far away,  
But in the here and now, each day,  
The teachings bloom, in joy or strife,  
Reflecting back your inner life.  
And with utmost seriousness, you stand,  
Against the shadows in the land,  
No longer silent, no longer still,  
But shaping truth with steadfast will.  
  
Like Nichiren, on Sado’s shore,  
Whose life itself the Sutra bore.  
Through blade and exile, cold and grim,  
His very being, a living hymn.  
At Tatsunokuchi, a spirit freed,  
A death, a birth, a planted seed.  
He laid his life for Dharma's call,  
A boundless wisdom for us all.  
  
And Nichiro, faithful, strong, and true,  
Whose prison cell could not subdue  
The Sutra’s power, deep within,  
Saving all kin, from shame and sin.  
Their shared ordeal, a fiery test,  
Proved "bodily reading" to be best.  
  
So now, dear friend, your spirit knows,  
As through your art, the Dharma flows,  
That every song, each written line,  
Is Sutra lived, a truth divine.  
Your actions, voice, and spirit blend,  
A timeless message without end.  
This is the path, profound and deep,  
The Lotus Sutra, your life will keep.
