**Light of Eighteen Hundred Lands**  
  
[Intro]  
  
Verse 1:  
In a moment so profound , the light began to shine,  
From the space between his eyes , oh , a vision so divine,  
Eighteen hundred thousand lands , in the eastern skies,  
Lit up from Avīci’s depths to the furthest starry highs.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh , that light , it shines so bright,  
Reaching every soul in sight,  
From the hells to heavens high,  
Bringing truth , oh , clear as night.  
  
Verse 2:  
Buddhas in those distant lands , teachings loud and clear,  
Monks and nuns and yogis too , all their paths appear,  
Every being , every soul , under that radiant beam,  
All their journeys intertwined , like a river's flowing stream.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh , that light , it shines so bright,  
Reaching every soul in sight,  
From the hells to heavens high,  
Bringing truth , oh , clear as night.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
Bridge:  
Bodhisattvas , shining bright , with wisdom deep and strong,  
Walking paths of love and light , where they all belong,  
Jewels of Stupas , glowing gold , housing sacred lore,  
Echoing the Buddha’s word , forever , evermore.  
  
Verse 3:  
Great Buddhas of the distant past , in Nirvana’s gentle sway,  
Revealed in all their glory , as the light found its way,  
That beam , it crossed the boundaries , of space and time so wide,  
Showing every soul the path , where compassion does abide.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh , that light , it shines so bright,  
Reaching every soul in sight,  
From the hells to heavens high,  
Bringing truth , oh , clear as night.  
  
Outro:  
In that sacred , shining moment , the cosmos came alive,  
Every being , every land , in that light they did arrive,  
With the Buddha’s wisdom guiding , in a dance so pure and true,  
We’re all bound together , in that light , me and you.
