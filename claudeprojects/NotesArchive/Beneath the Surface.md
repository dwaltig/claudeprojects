# Beneath the Surface  
  
"Beneath the Surface" is a hauntingly beautiful blues-folk ballad that explores the hidden depths of the human spirit. Inspired by an ancient oracle and a journey of self-discovery, the song delves into themes of decay, resilience, and the courage to confront uncomfortable truths. With raw, evocative lyrics and a melancholic melody, "Beneath the Surface" invites listeners to look beyond appearances and embrace the vulnerability of authentic living. It's a song about pruning the garden of the soul, letting go of what no longer serves, and finding hope amidst the cracks in the earth.

(Verse 1) Dust settles on the old stone well, Spirit whispers, a story to tell. Asked the question, heart full of plea, But the answer came back, a shadow on me.  
  
**(Chorus)** A pit in the ground, a shadow descends, Decay is creepin', where hope often ends. Bound by the water, lost in the foam, Gotta break these chains, to find my way home.  
  
(Verse 2) Took on too much, a tangled vine, Lost my direction, lost my shine. Tried to hold on, to everything I knew, But the roots were rotten, and the branches untrue.  
  
**(Chorus)** A pit in the ground, a shadow descends, Decay is creepin', where hope often ends. Bound by the water, lost in the foam, Gotta break these chains, to find my way home.  
  
(Bridge) Spirit's callin', a whisperin' breeze, Let go of the burden, find your ease. Prune the garden, let the sunlight through, A new bloom risin', honest and true.  
  
(Outro)  
(Harmonica solo - mournful and reflective) Yeah, gotta break these chains… find my way home… (Guitar fades out slowly)
