# Ocean of Wisdom  
  
[Verse]  
In a sea of thoughts I swim alone  
Searching for truth in the great unknown  
Depths unseen by eyes so blind  
Wisdom flows in waves unkind  
  
[Verse 2]  
You think you know but you ain't near  
The ocean's secrets are crystal clear  
Dive deep down where shadows play  
Find peace there and lose your way  
  
[Chorus]  
Buddha's wisdom so profound  
A vast ocean where I drown  
Elusive tides they come and go  
Beyond our reach but still we know  
  
[Verse 3]  
In the silence of the deep  
Where the wisdom tends to sleep  
Songs of ancient times do sing  
Echoes of the truths they bring  
  
[Verse 4]  
Float on currents of the wise  
Stars reflected in these eyes  
Infinite as the sky so vast  
Past the future and the past  
  
[Chorus]  
Buddha's wisdom so profound  
A vast ocean where I drown  
Elusive tides they come and go  
Beyond our reach but still we know
