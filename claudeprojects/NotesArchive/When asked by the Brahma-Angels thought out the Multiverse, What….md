"Ignorance leads to false ideas, which lead to false understanding, and then to the poor naming of things. This gives rise to the senses, which create contact, feeling, desire, striving, and existence. From existence come birth, aging, death, and all kinds of sorrow. This is how the whole mass of suffering begins."
