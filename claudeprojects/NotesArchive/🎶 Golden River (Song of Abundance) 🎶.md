*(Verse 1)*  
I stand in the river, where the gold dust flows,  
Sunlight shimmers, and the warm wind blows.  
I hear the call of the ancient sound,  
Wealth is a circle, it comes back ‘round.  
  
*(Pre-Chorus)*  
I give, I receive, like the tide and the sea,  
Every note that I sing sets my soul free.  
No more fear, no more doubt,  
What I send out, comes back around.  
  
*(Chorus)*  
🎶 **Money flows like a song through me,**  
🎶 **Every breath is prosperity.**  
🎶 **I walk in the rhythm, I dance in the light,**  
🎶 **The world gives me all I need tonight.**  
  
*(Verse 2)*  
The stars hum softly in the velvet sky,  
The trees, they whisper, “You’re born to fly.”  
I tune my heart to the highest key,  
Abundance sings in harmony.  
  
*(Pre-Chorus)*  
I trust, I release, like the waves on the shore,  
What I give, I’ll receive, and then even more.  
No more struggle, no more pain,  
I vibrate wealth like a sweet refrain.  
  
*(Chorus – Repeat with harmony & crescendo)*  
🎶 **Money flows like a song through me,**  
🎶 **Every breath is prosperity.**  
🎶 **I walk in the rhythm, I dance in the light,**  
🎶 **The world gives me all I need tonight.**  
  
*(Bridge – slow and powerful, almost gospel-like)*  
Oh, the river don’t stop, and neither do I,  
I lift up my voice, let my blessings rise.  
With love in my hands, and joy in my soul,  
I call to the heavens, let the good times roll.  
  
*(Final Chorus – big and triumphant!)*  
🎶 **Money flows like a song through me,**  
🎶 **Every breath is prosperity.**  
🎶 **I give with love, and love comes back,**  
🎶 **I walk in the rhythm, I’ll never lack.**  
  
*(Outro – soft, fading out like a chant)*  
Mmm… I walk in the rhythm, I walk in the light…  
Mmm… the world gives me all I need tonight…
