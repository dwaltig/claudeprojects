# High School Crush  
  
Verse 1:  
Walking down the hallway, books in hand,  
Caught your eye, didn’t understand,  
Butterflies in my stomach, racing fast,  
Hoping that this feeling’s gonna last.  
  
Pre-Chorus:  
Every smile you give, lights up my day,  
Trying to find the words, but I fade away.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, my teenage crush, got me feeling high,  
Dreaming of the moments when you’re nearby,  
Every little glance, every laugh we share,  
In my heart, I know you care.  
  
Verse 2:  
Lunchtime talks and secret notes,  
Shared playlists and midnight jokes,  
Sneaking glances in the crowded room,  
Waiting for the stars to make their move.  
  
Pre-Chorus:  
Every smile you give, lights up my day,  
Trying to find the words, but I fade away.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, my teenage crush, got me feeling high,  
Dreaming of the moments when you’re nearby,  
Every little glance, every laugh we share,  
In my heart, I know you care.  
  
Bridge:  
Maybe one day we’ll take the leap,  
Turn these dreams into memories we keep,  
Until then I’ll hold this spark inside,  
Wishing on the nights, you’re by my side.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, my teenage crush, got me feeling high,  
Dreaming of the moments when you’re nearby,  
Every little glance, every laugh we share,  
In my heart, I know you care.  
  
Outro:  
Heartbeat racing, under starry skies,  
With you, my teenage crush, time flies.
