Subject: Update on Correspondence with Teresa Regarding Unit #409  
  
Dear HOA Board Members,  
  
I am writing to update you on a recent interaction with Teresa, a resident concerned about the communication she received dated October 25, 2023, regarding Unit #409.  
  
During our conversation, I informed Teresa about the board's discussion of her case at our last meeting. It was my understanding that Creative Management had been directed to inform Teresa that the initial bill, which is under $300, would be canceled. Furthermore, we have allowed her the flexibility to make payments over time if she chooses.  
  
I also made it clear that Creative Management possesses phone records corresponding to the days in question, ensuring transparency and accuracy in handling this matter.   
  
In addition, I advised Teresa that if there are any further questions or concerns from her end, the board is open to arranging a meeting to address these directly. I encouraged her to reach out to Creative Management for any immediate queries.  
  
This email is to keep you all informed and to maintain transparency in our communications with the residents. Please let me know if there are any further actions or discussions needed regarding this matter.  
  
Thank you for your attention to this issue.  
  
Best Regards,  
  
William
