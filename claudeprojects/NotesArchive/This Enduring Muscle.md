(Verse 1)  
Woke up this mornin', sky was heavy gray  
Woke up this mornin', sky was heavy gray  
Felt that old man Job, just tryin' to find my way  
  
(Verse 2)  
Suffering knockin', like an unwelcome friend  
Yeah, sufferin' been knockin', seem like it ain't got no end  
Lookin' for the wisdom, 'round that weary bend  
  
(Chorus)  
They say ask for understanding, and it shall be given true  
(Lord, James said ask, and it shall be given to you)  
But this Enduring muscle, mine and yours gotta work it through  
Yeah, this Enduring muscle, gotta see what it can do.  
  
(Verse 3)  
Read about a Lotus, bloomin' in the mire  
Heard tell of a Lotus, settin' souls on fire  
Talkin' 'bout a long road, liftin' you up higher  
  
(Verse 4)  
Path ain't always easy, sometimes a burnin' ground  
No, this path ain't easy, sometimes a burnin', weary ground  
Gotta keep on walkin', 'til that true north is found.  
  
(Chorus)  
They say ask for understanding, and it shall be given true  
(Said, if you lack that wisdom, it'll be given unto you)  
But this Enduring muscle, me and you gotta work it through  
Yeah, this Enduring muscle, gotta see what we can do.  
(Instrumental Break - Guitar solo, expressing both pain and resilience, maybe a hint of a hopeful melody emerging)  
  
(Verse 5)  
Some folks get their answers, whispered on the breeze  
Some folks get their answers, fallin' on their knees  
Me, I'm out here flexin', tryin' to find my ease.  
  
(Verse 6)  
This ain't no quick fix, no easy way out I see  
No, this ain't no quick fix, for a soul like you and me  
Gotta build that power, to set your spirit free.  
  
(Outro Chorus)  
And that Enduring muscle, gotta make it strong and true  
(Gotta make it strong, gotta see you through)  
Flex it in the darkness, and the Lotus Light will shine for you  
Yeah, that Lotus Light gonna shine on through...  
(Slow fade with a final harmonica wail and a soft guitar strum)
