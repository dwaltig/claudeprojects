# Engaged Vision  
  
From Avici's depths to heavens' highest peak,   
A thousand million worlds, the Dharma Teacher's senses seek.   
Not "divine ear" attained, nor "heavenly eye's" pure gleam,   
But purified, born senses fulfilling wisdom's dream.   
  
To hear each whisper, song, and suffering's plea,   
A boundless awareness for all humanity.  
No path of flight, no quietist escape or shroud.   
The Lotus Sūtra calls, resounding through the crowd.   
  
The teacher deeply joins the world's grand stage,   
Unflinching, present, with truth's clear sight engage.   
For Buddhahood unfolds not far away,   
But in this Saha world, in light of day.  
  
The Bodhisattva's vow, a promise true,   
To purify this land, for all, for me, for you.   
Through "human revolution," hearts made strong and pure,   
This very world, the Buddha land, will then endure.   
  
Eshō funi, the person and land entwined,   
Compassion's power, mind and matter realigned.  
With skillful means, the wisdom freely shared,   
For every being, deeply loved and truly cared.   
  
Like Never Disparaging, we humbly bow,   
Fulfilling prophecies, beginning here and now.   
From Zhiyi's profound thought to Nichiren's call**,**   
To build a peace embracing one and all.   
  
Kōsen-rufu's dream, a world made whole and free.   
This active path, the Lotus mystery.
