# Sage Blues Deux  
  
Hey folks! I just put together a new playlist of my music called "Sage Blues Deux", and I'm super excited to share it with you.  
It's a bit different than my earlier stuff, maybe a little more seasoned and a bit more raw. Think bluesy heart, introspective lyrics, and a touch of cosmic inspiration. It's still that same Buddhist Gospel vibe, but with a bolder sound that I'm really loving.  
Give it a listen on SoundCloud and let me know what you think! I'd love to hear your thoughts on this new batch of songs.
