Lyrics:  
[Verse 1]  
When trouble knocks, don’t turn away,  
It’s just a friend in a stranger’s coat.  
When the night feels heavy, and skies turn gray,  
That’s the time to keep your soul afloat.  
  
[Chorus]  
Let it grow, let it grow,  
Endurance comes real slow.  
But when it’s grown, you’ll stand complete,  
Needing nothin’, on steady feet.  
  
[Verse 2]  
When your faith feels thin, and doubts draw near,  
Hold on tight, don’t let ’em win.  
Every trial carves the way so clear,  
Where the strong of heart begin again.  
  
[Chorus]  
Let it grow, let it grow,  
Endurance comes real slow.  
But when it’s grown, you’ll stand complete,  
Needing nothin’, on steady feet.  
  
[Bridge]  
If wisdom’s what you’re yearning for,  
Just ask — He won’t shut the door.  
The Giver’s kind, He won’t accuse,  
He’ll pour down light, if you just choose.  
  
[Final Chorus]  
Let it grow, let it grow,  
Endurance makes you whole.  
When it’s done, you’ll need no more,  
Love and peace forevermore.
