[Verse 1]  
When the nights   
were dark and long,  
And I couldn't   
find the way,  
find the way,  
find the way,  
I was lost   
in my own shadows,  
No light   
to guide my day.  
  
[Chorus]  
But now I smile   
despite it all,  
Through the pain,   
I stand tall.  
Found the power   
deep within,  
To show the world,   
We Can Win.  
We Can Win.  
We Can Win.  
We Can Win.  
We Can Win.  
We Can Win.  
  
[Verse 2]  
I used to wear   
a frown so deep,  
Anger was   
my only friend,  
But I found   
the light inside,  
And let   
the healing begin.  
  
[Chorus]  
Now I smile   
despite it all,  
Through the pain,   
I stand tall.  
Found the power   
deep within,  
To show the world,   
We Can Win.  
We Can Win.  
We Can Win.  
We Can Win.  
We Can Win.  
We Can Win.  
  
[Verse 2]  
[Verse 2]  
[Verse 2]  
[Verse 2]  
[Verse 2]  
[Verse 2]  
[Verse 2]  
I used to wear   
a frown so deep,  
Anger was   
my only friend,  
But I found   
the light inside,  
And let   
the healing begin.  
the healing begin.  
  
[Chorus]  
Now I smile   
despite it all,  
Through the pain,   
I stand tall.  
Found the power   
deep within,  
To show the world,   
We Can Win.  
We Can Win.  
We Can Win.  
We Can Win.  
We Can Win.  
We Can Win.  
We Can Win.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[Bridge]  
In the darkest hour,   
I found my strength,  
A joy that wouldn't fade.  
Now I shine   
with all my might,  
In this love,   
I'm unafraid.  
  
[Chorus]  
So I smile   
despite it all,  
Through the pain,   
I stand tall.  
Found the power   
deep within,  
To show the world,   
we can win.  
  
[Outro]  
With every step,   
I choose to see,  
The beauty   
that life can be.  
I'll spread my joy   
to every heart,  
A smile,   
a brand new start.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[End.]
