# Mystic Truth Blues  
  
[Intro]  
  
[Verse 1]  
  
If you wish to free yourself,   
from the sufferings of time,  
And reach that perfect light,   
in this very life of mine,  
You must see the mystic truth,   
that's in every living soul,  
Chant Myoho-renge-kyo,   
Chant Myoho-renge-kyo,   
Chant Myoho-renge-kyo,   
Chant Myoho-renge-kyo,   
let the mystic law take hold.  
  
[Chorus]  
Myoho-renge-kyo,   
Myoho-renge-kyo,   
Myoho-renge-kyo,   
the king of sutras shines,  
With every word and principle,   
it speaks of the divine,  
Chanting from the heart,   
with a faith so true,  
Awaken to the mystic,   
in everything you do.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Life at each moment,   
body, mind, and soul,  
In the ten worlds of being,   
it’s the truth we all must know,  
From the earth to the sky,   
in every grain of dust,  
The mystic law is shining,   
in the faith that we must trust.  
  
[Chorus]  
Myoho-renge-kyo,   
Myoho-renge-kyo,   
Myoho-renge-kyo,   
the king of sutras shines,  
With every word and principle,   
it speaks of the divine,  
Chanting from the heart,   
with a faith so true,  
Awaken to the mystic,   
in everything you do.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[Bridge]  
Polish that mirror,   
day and night,  
Let it shine like a jewel,   
in the Buddha's light,  
The mind may be clouded,   
but with every chant,  
Clear it becomes,   
with Myoho-renge-kyo's chance.  
with Myoho-renge-kyo's chance.  
with Myoho-renge-kyo's chance.  
with Myoho-renge-kyo's chance.  
  
[reprise-Bridge]  
[reprise-Bridge]  
[reprise-Bridge]  
[reprise-Bridge]  
[reprise-Bridge]  
Polish that mirror,   
day and night,  
Let it shine like a jewel,   
in the Buddha's light,  
The mind may be clouded,   
but with every chant,  
Clear it becomes,   
(Clear it becomes),   
(Clear it becomes),   
(Clear it becomes),   
(Clear it becomes),   
with Myoho-renge-kyo's chance.  
with Myoho-renge-kyo's chance.  
  
[Verse 3]  
No teaching from outside,   
can lead you to the light,  
It’s within your own life,   
where the mystic truth shines bright,  
Seek not outside yourself,   
for the wealth that you possess,  
In the chanting of this law,   
lies the key to your success.  
  
[Chorus]  
Myoho-renge-kyo,   
Myoho-renge-kyo,   
Myoho-renge-kyo,   
the king of sutras shines,  
With every word and principle,   
it speaks of the divine,  
Chanting from the heart,   
with a faith so true,  
Awaken to the mystic,   
in everything you do.  
  
[Outro]  
Maintain your faith,   
and never doubt,  
In this lifetime,   
Buddhahood will sprout,  
Nam-myoho-renge-kyo,   
with every breath and rhyme,  
Let’s sing the mystic truth,   
in the rhythm of our time.
