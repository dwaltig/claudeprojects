# HOA Meeting FAQ  
## Financials  
**1. Are the HOA fees increasing next year?**  
No, the HOA board voted to keep the assessment fees the same as the current year. However, fees will likely increase by 10% next year to cover anticipated expenses.  
**2. Why is a 10% increase in HOA fees being considered for next year?**  
Several factors are contributing to a potential fee increase for the next fiscal year. These include:  
* **Inflation and rising material costs:** The cost of building materials is expected to increase, impacting future repair and maintenance projects.  
* **Major repairs and replacements:** The property requires ongoing maintenance and several significant repairs or replacements are anticipated in the coming years, such as roof replacement and concrete work.  
* **Reserve fund:** While the HOA currently has a healthy reserve fund, the board aims to maintain a robust financial standing to address unexpected events or emergencies.

**3. What is the status of the East fence project?**  
The East fence project is currently on hold as the HOA is awaiting a final bid from the contractor. A deposit has been paid, which should have expedited the scheduling, but there seems to be a delay. The property manager will follow up with the contractor to determine the reason for the delay and get the project back on track.  
**4. What is being done to address the issue with rats, mice, and skunks on the property?**  
The current pest control company will be consulted to assess the situation and recommend solutions. Deterrents for skunks will be explored. While completely eliminating pests may be challenging due to the property's proximity to natural areas, the goal is to minimize their presence and impact.
