**Lyrics:**  
  
When the night is long and cold,  
And my heart feels worn and old,  
And my heart feels worn and old,  
And my heart feels worn and old,  
I turn to the sky, seeking light,  
In the darkness. I find my fight.  
  
Oh, I find peace, In the blues.  
When the world feels heavy, I choose,  
To lift my eyes, trust the muse,  
In the blues I find my peace, my truth  
  
(Instrumental)  
  
Walking down this lonesome road,  
Carryin' my burdens a every load,  
Carryin' my burdens a every load,  
Carryin' my burdens a every load,  
But there's a song in the wind's sir,  
Whisperings hope as it passes by.  
Whisperings hope as it passes by.  
  
Oh, I find peace,  
Oh, I find peace,  
In the blues,  
When the world feels heavy, I choose,  
To lift my eyes, trust the muse,  
In the blues I find my peace, my truth.  
  
(Instrumental)  
  
In the darkest hour. I hear a call,  
A gentle voice through it all,  
It tells me to hold on tight,  
For there's always dawn after night.  
For there's always dawn after night.  
  
So, I sing my song with heart and soul,  
Let the music make me whole.  
In every note, a story's told,  
Of finding faith in the days of old.  
  
Oh, I find peace,   
Oh, I find peace,   
Oh, I find peace,   
In the blues,  
In the blues,  
In the blues,  
When the world feels heavy, I choose, To lift my eyes, trust the muse,  
In the blues I find my peace, my truth.  
  
(Instrumental)  
  
When the road is rough and steep,  
And the nights are hard to sleep.  
And the nights are hard to sleep.  
And the nights are hard to sleep.  
I find my solace in the blues,  
In every sorrow there's a light to choose.  
  
(Instrumental)  
  
When the road is rough and steep,  
And the nights are hard to sleep.  
And the nights are hard to sleep.  
And the nights are hard to sleep.  
I find my solace in the blues,  
In every sorrow there's a light to choose.  
 Oh, I find peace, In the blues,  
When the world feels heavy, I choose,  
To lift my eyes, trust the muse,  
In every sorrow there's a light to choose.  
  
In the blues I find my peace, my truth  
In the blues I find my peace, my truth
