Lyrics:   
[Verse]  
When we start to breath easy no more disguise  
No judging or harshness just feeling so free  
Letting go of the chaos not living in lies  
Finding our true selves in the meditative sea  
  
[Verse]  
With gentle reflection breaking down the walls  
Old habits can fade in the light of our gaze  
Where deception falls silent and truth softly calls  
Transforming each moment escaping the maze  
  
[Chorus]  
In the calm of our minds we unravel the fight  
Embracing ourselves with a love so divine  
Shedding skins of the past into clearer light  
In the stillness of now everything aligns  
  
[Verse]  
Maitri's the compass guiding us through  
Renouncing the shadows in a kind gentle way  
With compassion we find what is honest and true  
Releasing the hurt from yesterday  
  
[Bridge]  
It's an oasis of peace where transformations grow  
With patience and grace we dance through the night  
In the garden of our souls where true seeds sow  
In the dawn of self-love everything just feels right  
  
[Chorus]  
In the calm of our minds we unravel the fight  
Embracing ourselves with a love so divine  
Shedding skins of the past into clearer light  
In the stillness of now everything aligns
