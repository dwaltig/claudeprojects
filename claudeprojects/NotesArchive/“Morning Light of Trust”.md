**“Morning Light of Trust”**  
**“Morning Light of Trust”**  
  
*Verse 1:*  
*Verse 1:*  
In the quiet of the morning,  
Where the light begins to break,  
We walk the path of wisdom,  
Trusting each step we take.  
Like a tree by the waters,  
Rooted deep in faith and grace,  
We find strength in our stillness,  
In the light of a new day’s face.  
  
*Chorus:*  
*Chorus:*  
Guide us through the shadows,  
Lead us toward the dawn,  
In every breath, a promise,  
In every step, a song.  
  
*Verse 2:*  
*Verse 2:*  
When the storm clouds gather round us,  
And the night feels cold and long,  
We find shelter in the silence,  
In the place where we belong.  
Every fear a distant echo,  
Every worry fades away,  
For we are held by gentle hands,  
In the calm of morning’s sway.  
  
*Chorus:*  
*Chorus:*  
Guide us through the shadows,  
Lead us toward the dawn,  
In every breath, a promise,  
In every step, a song.  
  
*Bridge:*  
*Bridge:*  
In the trust of the unseen,  
In the guidance from above,  
We walk a path that’s shining,  
Filled with light and love.  
  
*Outro:*  
*Outro:*  
Morning light, morning light,  
Hold us in your warm embrace,  
As we rise with hearts awakened,  
To the gift of a brand new day.
