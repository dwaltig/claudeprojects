Friend, October 10, 2010, I joined a small faith group because the ones who introduced me to their faith, I believed, were “Awakened Beings,” teaching the authentic way. It took me five years to learn and reap the benefits. Once I learned how to see the world, I met divine beings. I’m fortunate to consider Brahma, Shakra, Christ, The Buddhas, demons, and angels as friends and benefactors. I didn’t come from this kind of mumbo-jumbo. I grew up Protestant, yet I abandoned it because it didn’t answer my questions. I became a seeker at the age of 14. I’ve explored a lot of different faiths and atheism. I have deep respect for them all. Now, I consider myself a learner-Unitarian or Universalist. But I never expected these Esoteric experiences. I listen to all their messages and gain from their guidance.  
Science has been my guide. Laws govern our world. Our actions must be skillful at producing the desired fruit. Powerful forces surround us. Insight, like opportunity, abounds and has its organic order. Faith is astounding. I’ve met gods, unsought, from many different pantheons (Christian, Greek, Norse, Egyptian, Hindu). They have offered many gifts, some taken or returned because I didn’t dare to wield them or they expected my naïveté (Learning). But I have no one to share my experiences with. I’ve been in this weird flow for at least seven years. I’ve learned to read the signs according to the writings of Jung and a Tibetan Master. Figments of my delusion. My spiritual practice is based largely on the Sutra of the Wonderful Dharma. I’m seeking guidance. I hope you can help.
