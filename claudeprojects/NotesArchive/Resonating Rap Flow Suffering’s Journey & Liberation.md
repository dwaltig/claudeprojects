*Verse 1:*  
Suffering exists, man, it’s the pulse in our pain,  
A shadow on our shoulders, echoes in the rain.  
Every scar’s a story, every tear lays the seed—  
In the heart of the struggle, our spirit finds the need.  
I’m asking, why we hurt? What’s the cost of our climb?  
In the chaos of our doubts, we find our rhythm in time.  
  
*Hook:*  
Yes, suffering’s real, but it fuels our spark,  
In the fire of the struggle, we ignite out of the dark.  
Every trial’s a lesson, every wound’s a spark—  
Step up, break the chains, and light up the dark.  
  
*Verse 2:*  
Doubt’s the constant beat, questioning our fate,  
Every setback’s a lesson that we just can’t overstate.  
Feel the pressure of the grind, but know the path’s not set—  
In every broken piece, a future is met.  
We ride the storm with resilience, a rhythm so raw,  
Transforming every sorrow into something to adore.  
  
*Bridge:*  
The road ahead’s uncharted, but the beat is still loud,  
We’re crafting our tomorrow, standing fierce and proud.  
Through the fire and the rain, our souls ignite—  
Rising from the ashes to meet the dawn’s first light.  
  
*Verse 3:*  
In the cadence of our questioning, we find a new way,  
Turning scars into lyrics, pain into a brighter day.  
Every verse a declaration, every line a breakthrough,  
Resonating in the struggle, our spirit pushing through.  
Let’s dance upon our shadows, let the past unwind—  
In the art of overcoming, true freedom we find.  
  
*Outro:*  
So remember, suffering’s real, but it’s not the final score—  
It’s the heartbeat of our journey, the key to something more.  
Keep questioning, keep rising, let your spirit be free—  
In the rap of our lives, we’re writing our destiny.
