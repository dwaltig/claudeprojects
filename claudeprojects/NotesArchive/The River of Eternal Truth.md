[Intro]  
  
*(Verse 1)* In the silence of the night,   
where the stars align, The wisdom of the ages,   
flows through space and time. Beneath the jeweled trees,   
where the Buddhas shine, We gather round the fire,   
to hear the truth divine.  
  
*(Chorus)* Oh, the river flows,   
with the light of endless days, Guided by the Buddha,   
we walk the timeless ways. Through the sands of countless worlds,   
we find our peace, In the river of eternal truth,   
where all suffering shall cease.  
  
*(Verse 2)* Spiritual seekers rise,   
like grains of golden sand, Holding to the mantra,   
in the palm of their hand. The wheel of wisdom turns,   
in every heart it spins, Leading to the shores,   
where enlightenment begins.  
  
*(Chorus)* Oh, the river flows,   
with the light of endless days, Guided by the Buddha,   
we walk the timeless ways. Through the sands of countless worlds,   
we find our peace, In the river of eternal truth,   
where all suffering shall cease.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
*(Bridge)* Mandarava falls,   
from the heavens up high, Covering the Buddhas,   
as they sit in the sky. Heavenly drums beat soft,   
with no hands in sight, While the scent of sandalwood   
drifts through the night.  
  
*(Verse 3)* In the circle of this life,   
some have miles to go, But every step they take,   
the truth begins to show. One more lifetime here,   
or eight to understand, The river of eternal truth,   
will lead us to that land.  
  
*(Chorus)* Oh, the river flows,   
with the light of endless days, Guided by the Buddha,   
we walk the timeless ways. Through the sands of countless worlds,   
we find our peace, In the river of eternal truth,   
where all suffering shall cease.  
  
*(Outro)* So let the flowers rain, let the incense rise, As we sing to the Buddhas in the boundless skies. In the river of eternal truth, we’ll find our song, A journey to enlightenment, where we all belong.
