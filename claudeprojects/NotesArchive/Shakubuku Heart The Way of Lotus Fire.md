# Shakubuku Heart: The Way of Lotus Fire  
  
**Through the mist of provisional truths,**   
**The Lotus stands eternal, pure and bright.**   
  
Like diamond cutting stone, the teaching soothes   
While challenging what dims the perfect light.  
  
To challenge falsehood with a steady hand,   
Yet hold compassion for the searching heart—  
This tension forms the practice, understand:   
To separate the teaching, not to part  
The person from their Buddha-nature deep.   
  
The sword of wisdom severs only views   
That bind us to the shore of suffering's keep,   
While honoring the path each soul must choose.  
  
**When anger rises like a sudden storm,**   
**Remember: you but mirror future Buddhas.**   
  
Their resistance takes familiar form—   
The same resistance we once held as brothers.  
  
In refutation, find a gentle fire   
That burns away delusion, not the soul.   
  
This is the challenge Nichiren requires:   
To stand unmoved, yet make the wounded whole.  
  
The rhythm of this practice ebbs and flows   
Between assertive truth and patient love.   
  
The Lotus blooms wherever dharma grows,   
Though thorns protect what petals rise above.  
  
**So wield the truth with fierce sincerity,**   
**Yet bow before the Buddha in your foe.**   
  
For in this paradox, serenity   
Takes root in soil where only truth can grow.
