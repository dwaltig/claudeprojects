That’s a great idea! Here’s a version of the poem adapted into lyrics for a blues folk song:  
  
A Student’s Journey  
  
(Verse 1)  
In the light of the Lotus Sutra, I find my way,  
A humble student, learning each and every day.  
Promises of wisdom, in verses so old,  
Guiding my spirit, making me bold.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, I’m living the Sutra, walking the line,  
With creativity, compassion, and joy so fine.  
In every moment, I see the divine,  
Living the promises, in this heart of mine.  
  
(Verse 2)  
With each dawn’s light, creativity blooms,  
Inspired by teachings, in my heart’s rooms.  
Art, music, and words, all sacred songs,  
In the Sutra’s embrace, it’s where I belong.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, I’m living the Sutra, walking the line,  
With creativity, compassion, and joy so fine.  
In every moment, I see the divine,  
Living the promises, in this heart of mine.  
  
(Bridge)  
In relationships, compassion takes root,  
Kindness and understanding, the pursuit.  
Every interaction, a chance to see,  
The Buddha within, in you and me.  
  
(Verse 3)  
Daily life a canvas, painted with joy,  
Simple moments, no troubles destroy.  
Promises kept, in actions so pure,  
A heart full of love, steadfast and sure.  
  
(Chorus)  
Oh, I’m living the Sutra, walking the line,  
With creativity, compassion, and joy so fine.  
In every moment, I see the divine,  
Living the promises, in this heart of mine.  
  
(Outro)  
Divine beings watch, protect, and guide,  
Their wisdom and insight, by my side.  
In their presence, I find my peace,  
A student of the Sutra, my journey’s release.
