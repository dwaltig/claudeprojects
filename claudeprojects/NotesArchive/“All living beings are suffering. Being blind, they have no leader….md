*“All living beings are suffering. Being blind, they have no leader. They do not know how to stop suffering, Or that they should seek emancipation. In the long night fewer people go to heaven, And more people go to the evil regions. They go from darkness to darkness, and do not hear Of the names of the Buddhas.”*  
  
The children of Great-Universal-Wisdom-Excellence Buddha proclaim this to their father in a story told by Śākyamuni Buddha in Chapter Seven of the Lotus Sūtra. They understand that when beings are so preoccupied with their own happiness, and so convinced that this happiness comes from what they can acquire, that they need an enlightened being to lead them to see the world as it is. With the Lotus Sūtra as the embodiment of the Buddha’s highest teaching, we have the same wisdom present to us as those children’s father was to them.
