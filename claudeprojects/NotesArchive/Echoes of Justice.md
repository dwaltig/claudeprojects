In the quiet of the morning,   
In the quiet of the morning,   
'fore the sun begins to rise, I whisper prayers for justice,   
'fore the sun begins to rise, I whisper prayers for justice,   
with tears welling in my eyes. I seek a world of fairness,   
with tears welling in my eyes. I seek a world of fairness,   
where the wronged can find their peace, Where innocence is shielded,   
where the wronged can find their peace, Where innocence is shielded,   
and the cries of pain will cease.

Echoes of justice,   
Echoes of justice,   
ringing through the night, Calling for protection,   
ringing through the night, Calling for protection,   
in the darkest fight. With hearts full of integrity,   
in the darkest fight. With hearts full of integrity,   
we stand with heads held high, Seeking transformation,   
we stand with heads held high, Seeking transformation,   
'neath the boundless sky.

Walkin' down this lonesome highway,   
Walkin' down this lonesome highway,   
with the weight of years gone by, I hold onto my innocence,   
with the weight of years gone by, I hold onto my innocence,   
as the world just passes by. In the shadows of the valley,   
as the world just passes by. In the shadows of the valley,   
where the light is hard to see, I feel the hand of mercy,   
where the light is hard to see, I feel the hand of mercy,   
reaching out to set me free.

ringing through the night, Calling for protection,

in the darkest fight. With hearts full of integrity,   
we stand with heads held high, Seeking transformation,   
we stand with heads held high, Seeking transformation,   
'neath the boundless sky.  
'neath the boundless sky.

Oh, the winds of change are blowin',   
Oh, the winds of change are blowin',   
through the hills and through the plains, Bringing hope and healing,   
through the hills and through the plains, Bringing hope and healing,   
washing away the stains. In the river of redemption,   
washing away the stains. In the river of redemption,   
where the broken find their way, We rise up from the ashes,   
where the broken find their way, We rise up from the ashes,   
to face a brighter day.

Now the moon is softly shining,   
Now the moon is softly shining,   
on a world that's still in strife, But I hold a flame of justice,   
on a world that's still in strife, But I hold a flame of justice,   
to light the path of life. For every soul that's weary,   
to light the path of life. For every soul that's weary,   
and every heart that's torn, There's a promise of tomorrow,   
and every heart that's torn, There's a promise of tomorrow,   
in the breaking of the dawn.

In the echoes of the evening,   
In the echoes of the evening,   
when the stars begin to fall, We'll find our peace in justice,   
when the stars begin to fall, We'll find our peace in justice,   
and the strength to stand tall. With a heart full of courage,   
and the strength to stand tall. With a heart full of courage,   
and a spirit shining bright, We'll walk the road of righteousness,   
and a spirit shining bright, We'll walk the road of righteousness,   
guided by the light.
