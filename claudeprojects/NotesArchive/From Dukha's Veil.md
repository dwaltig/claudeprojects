From Dukha's Veil  
   
From Dukha's veil, a mind set free,  
Enlightenment's dawn, a new decree.  
Emancipation's wings take flight,  
Soaring high, embracing light.  
   
No longer bound by shackles tight,  
Reason reigns, a guiding light.  
Knowledge flows, a potent stream,  
Nourishing every hopeful dream.  
   
The chains of dogma fall away,  
Replaced by truth, a brighter day.  
Independent thought, a vibrant flame,  
Burning bright, defying shame.  
   
Creativity, a boundless sea,  
Unleashed at last, wild and free.  
New worlds explored, unseen before,  
Breaking barriers, reaching for more.  
   
Individuality, a precious gem,  
Shines with strength, untouched by them.  
Diversity embraced, a vibrant hue,  
Each voice distinct, ringing true.  
   
From Duka's grasp, a soul unbound,  
Empowered now, on solid ground.  
With open hearts and minds so clear,  
Building a future, drawing near.  
   
A world where justice holds the key,  
Equality reigns, eternally.  
In this new dawn, we take our stand,  
United minds, hand in hand.  
   
So let us celebrate this day,  
The breaking free, the brighter way.  
Dukha's grip is finally undone,  
And enlightenment, for everyone.
