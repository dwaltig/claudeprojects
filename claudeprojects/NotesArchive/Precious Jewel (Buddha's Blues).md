# Precious Jewel (Buddha's Blues)

The song narrates the spiritual journey of aged disciples who discover unexpected enlightenment. With its meditative yet bluesy atmosphere, it blends Western musical traditions with Eastern philosophical themes. Acoustic guitar, slide guitar, and harmonica create a rich soundscape, while a Tibetan singing bowl adds a unique spiritual dimension. The lyrics explore themes of lifelong learning, spiritual awakening, and finding hope in later life.

Verse 1:  
Old bones achin', sittin' at the master's feet  
Thought I'd found my peace, my journey complete  
But the Buddha's words, they shook my soul  
Showed me a path I'd never known  
  
Chorus:  
Found a precious jewel, never knew I was searchin'  
Enlightenment's fire, in my old heart burnin'  
Oh Lord Buddha, you've opened my eyes  
To a treasure I never thought to find  
  
Verse 2:  
Subhuti and Kasyapa, we thought we knew it all  
Moggallana and Katyayana, we'd answered the call  
But your wisdom, Lord, it struck us dumb  
Showed us our journey's just begun

Bridge:  
We're never too old, never too wise  
To learn and to grow, to touch the sky  
Age may bend us, but our spirits soar  
When we open our hearts to something more  
  
Verse 3:  
So we bow our heads, join our hands in prayer  
Gratitude fills us for the truth you share  
This precious jewel, this priceless gift  
Has given our old souls a mighty lift  
  
Chorus:  
Found a precious jewel, never knew I was searchin'  
Enlightenment's fire, in my old heart burnin'  
Oh Lord Buddha, you've opened my eyes  
To a treasure I never thought to find  
To a treasure I never thought to find  
  
Outro:  
Oh, this precious jewel, it shines so bright  
Guiding us through the darkest night  
Thank you, Buddha, for showing the way  
To a brand new dawn, a brand new day
