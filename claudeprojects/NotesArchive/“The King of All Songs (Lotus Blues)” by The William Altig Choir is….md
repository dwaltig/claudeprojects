*“The King of All Songs (Lotus Blues)”* by **The William Altig Choir** is a soulful, slow-burning folk-blues hymn inspired by Chapter 23 of the *Lotus Sutra*. A preacher’s whisper meets the river’s hum — it’s a song about awakening, mercy, and the healing power of truth.  
Over warm acoustic guitar and haunting slide, a baritone voice tells of the mountain of wisdom that rises in every heart, the Sutra that cools our thirst and lights the dark. It’s gospel for the seeker, blues for the broken, and peace for the weary.  
This song invites you to stand at the river’s edge, look toward the golden mountain, and remember: the King of All Songs is already singing in you.
