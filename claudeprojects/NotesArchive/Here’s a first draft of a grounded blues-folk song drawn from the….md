Here’s a first draft of a **grounded blues-folk song** drawn from the heart of Nichiren’s radical Lotus Sūtra vision—its universal salvation, the “secret doctrine” of Buddha-nature in every being, and the fierce compassion that drove him to sing it loud .

**The Great Vessel Blues**  
  
*(Slow 12-bar blues in D, with a lonesome slide guitar and low harmonica hum. Tempo: steady, deliberate—like a river that knows where it’s headed.)*  
  
**Verse 1 – The Hidden Shore**  
I’ve walked these storm-tossed streets of doubt,  
Mappō winds keep howlin’ loud.  
They said some hearts can never bloom,  
But the Lotus breaks that shroud.  
Dragon daughter, devil cousin—  
Buddhahood shines in ‘em all somehow.  
  
**Chorus – One Great Vessel**  
Climb aboard this single boat,  
Bigger than a thousand seas.  
No soul’s too lost, no night too dark,  
For the Law that sets us free.  
Nam-myōhō renge-kyō—  
Sing it low, let the whole world know.  
  
**Verse 2 – The Mirror of a Moment**  
Ten worlds in every heartbeat pound,  
Hell and heaven side by side.  
Every sinner, every saint,  
Bears the Buddha deep inside.  
Polish that mirror, let it gleam—  
No need to wait, no place to hide.  
  
**Chorus – One Great Vessel**  
Climb aboard this single boat,  
Bigger than a thousand seas.  
No soul’s too lost, no night too dark,  
For the Law that sets us free.  
Nam-myōhō renge-kyō—  
Sing it low, let the whole world know.  
  
**Bridge – Fierce Compassion**  
Some called him proud, some called him wild,  
But he burned with a mother’s care.  
Faced the exile, faced the sword,  
Sang salvation everywhere.  
It ain’t anger, it’s love on fire—  
A vow the coldest night can’t snare.  
  
**Verse 3 – Right Here, Right Now**  
Not in temples locked away,  
Not in heaven’s distant hall.  
Where the chant is heard, the Gohonzon lives,  
The sacred flows through all.  
Faith and practice, Buddha’s power—  
Four winds lifting every call.  
  
**Final Chorus – One Great Vessel (reprise)**  
Climb aboard this single boat,  
Bigger than a thousand seas.  
Every heart’s a hidden shore,  
The Mystic Law’s the key.  
Nam-myōhō renge-kyō—  
Sing it low, let the whole world know.  
  
*(Fade with harmonica bending into silence, like a lantern light across dark water.)*

**Performance & Production Notes**  
	•	**Feel & Groove:** Slow, swampy D-blues with finger-picked acoustic, resonator slide guitar, upright bass, and brushed snare.  
	•	**Vocals:** Weathered baritone lead, backed by a call-and-response folk choir to echo the communal awakening.  
	•	**Texture:** Occasional harmonica wails and subtle organ pads to suggest the “mystic law” resonating under the surface.  
  
**Why it Works**  
  
This song distills Nichiren’s teaching that **every being—“evil, stupid, women, and those without Buddha-nature”—holds the seed of Buddhahood** . It honors his fearless compassion and the practice of chanting daimoku as a daily, living blues.  
  
Would you like me to shape the lyrics toward a more secular audience (less direct Buddhist terminology) or keep the current devotional tone?
