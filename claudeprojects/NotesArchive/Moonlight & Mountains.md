Lyrics:  
(Verse 1)  
In the realm of sacred echoes, a teaching unfolds,  
A vast ocean rising, more than every river's flow.  
An eternal mount where wisdom climbs like Everest,  
High peaks aglow, where ancient truths bestow.  
  
(Chorus)  
Can you feel that power, the light that fills the night?  
Let these sacred words lift you up and set your soul alight.  
In the bloom of the lotus, in every whispered theme,  
We live our truth in luminous dreams.  
  
(Verse 2)  
A moon so brilliant, outshining countless beams,  
Guiding us softly through the dark and mystic night.  
Even the sun, the vanquisher of every shadow,  
Finds a kindred spark in that everlasting light.  
  
(Chorus)  
Can you feel that power, the light that fills the night?  
Let these sacred words lift you up and set your soul alight.  
In the bloom of the lotus, in every whispered theme,  
We live our truth in luminous dreams.  
  
(Verse 3)  
See the lotus bloom—a divine sovereign among gods,  
A celestial parent, gentle as Brahma’s embrace.  
Nurturing every seeker with love that never fades,  
A beacon of solace in our restless human race.  
  
(Bridge)  
It’s a well for the thirsty, a fire for the cold,  
Clothing naked hearts in whispers of grace untold.  
A guide for every wanderer on roads uncharted and long,  
A boat to carry us where all the weary belong.  
  
(Chorus)  
Can you feel that power, the light that fills the night?  
Let these sacred words lift you up and set your soul alight.  
In the bloom of the lotus, in every whispered theme,  
We live our truth in luminous dreams.  
  
(Verse 4)  
A healer for the wounds unseen, a lamp amid the night,  
A jewel for the needy, scattering shadows with its gleam.  
This ancient text calls out to us—question, wander, roam,  
Embrace each word, step boldly towards that guiding beam.  
  
(Chorus – Variation)  
Oh, can we rise like the lotus, let our souls inspire?  
Live our truth in luminous dreams, set our hearts on fire.  
In the chorus of the cosmos, where every star redeems,  
We journey on in soulful streams.  
  
(Outro)  
In the vibrant dance of celestial design,  
We ponder wisdom’s glow, so timeless and divine.  
Let the lotus be our anthem, in every heartfelt theme—  
Together we live our truth in luminous dreams.
