# Blues of Compassion  
  
**Verse 1**   
Woke up this mornin', feelin' the blues so deep,   
A world awash in sorrow's sea, my soul does weep.   
See the pain in every face, hear the cries of despair,   
This Bodhisattva path, a heavy cross to bear.  
  
**Chorus**   
But I keep on walkin', steady as the tide,   
Carryin' the weight of the world inside.   
This ain't no easy road, no simple plight,   
But I'm bound for enlightenment, my guiding light.  
  
**Verse 2**   
Left behind my selfish ways, the path of greed and pride,   
Kindled compassion's flame, let my ego subside.   
Gotta conquer my own demons, face the darkness within,   
So I can offer a hand to others, help them rise from sin.  
  
**Chorus**   
But I keep on walkin', steady as the tide,   
Carryin' the weight of the world inside.   
This ain't no easy road, no simple plight,   
But I'm bound for enlightenment, my guiding light.  
  
**Bridge**   
They say the Bodhisattva path is long and full of strife,   
But I'm fueled by bodhichitta, the awakened mind's life.   
With every step I take, I feel my spirit grow,   
Plantin' seeds of kindness, watchin' compassion flow.  
  
**Chorus**   
But I keep on walkin', steady as the tide,   
Carryin' the weight of the world inside.   
This ain't no easy road, no simple plight,   
But I'm bound for enlightenment, my guiding light.  
  
**Outro**   
Yeah, the blues may linger, but my heart is filled with grace,   
Walkin' the Bodhisattva path, bringin' light to every space.   
The blues may linger, but my heart is filled with grace,   
Walkin' the Bodhisattva path, bringin' light to every space.
