# The Lotus Sūtra's Path to Swift Bodhisattvahood  
  
The **Lotus Sūtra**, "King of Sutras," calls   
A **swift path** promised, transcending all walls.   
No longer a journey, winding and slow,   
But **inherent Buddha-nature**, begins now to glow.  
  
A **Dharma Teacher**, defined broad and deep   
Through **five core practices**, true wisdom to keep.   
**Receiving, upholding**, the Dharma's pure light   
**Reading, reciting**, with vocal might.   
Then **copying** mindfully, character by character   
Engaging the **Dharma Body**, dispelling all fear.   
**Expounding** to others, the highest of deeds,   
For **swift Bodhisattvahood**, this practice proceeds.  
  
For **Buddha-nature** lies within every soul,   
Even in those once seen beyond reach or control.   
The **Eternal Buddha**, present in every space,   
This world is **Pure Land**, by his eternal grace.   
Through **One Vehicle** unified, by **skillful means** shown,   
**Samsara is Nirvana**, the seed is now sown.  
  
From profound **gratitude**, **compassion** takes flight,   
**Altruistic actions**, transforming the night.   
**No shortage of teachers**, in every face found   
**No shortage of joy**, where blessings abound.   
**Opportunities boundless**, to help and to share   
Through **human revolution**, our **Buddha-land** to prepare.  
  
The Lotus's radiance, eternally bright,   
A holistic awakening, embracing all light**.**
