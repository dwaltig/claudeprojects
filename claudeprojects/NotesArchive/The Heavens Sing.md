# The Heavens Sing  
  
The heavens sing of goodness bright,   
The sky displays its wondrous light.   
From dawn to dusk, a silent tale,   
Of wisdom shared, without fail.  
  
No words they speak, no voice is heard,   
Yet through the cosmos, message stirred.   
From distant stars to nearby breeze,   
Their silent song, all hearts to seize.  
  
The sun, a bridegroom proud and grand,   
Races its course across the land.   
From east to west, its warmth unfurls,   
No shadow hides from golden swirls.  
  
Truth's law is pure, souls come alive,   
Its wisdom sure, hearts thrive and strive.   
Just precepts ring with joyful sound,   
Clear edicts shine, wisdom profound.  
  
Clean is its fear, eternal, true,   
Just judgments clear, forever new.  
More precious than fine golden ore,   
Sweeter than honey's deepest store.  
  
By them I'm warned, rewards unfold,   
Yet who can know sins left untold?   
Cleanse hidden faults, from errors free,   
From willful sins, deliver me.  
  
May words I speak and heart's deep sighs   
Be pleasing in your watchful eyes.   
O Rock and Redeemer divine,   
This soul, this heart, forever thine.
