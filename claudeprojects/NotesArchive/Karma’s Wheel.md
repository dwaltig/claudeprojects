# Karma’s Wheel  
  
*Karma’s Wheel* is a haunting, bluesy folk ballad that delves into the inevitable journey of cause and consequence. Inspired by the timeless wisdom, “When we do bad deeds, our bad deeds will lead us to sufferings in the future,” the song paints a vivid picture of how actions echo back to the soul in mysterious ways. Sung by Dionysus, the Greek god of revelry, his earthy yet otherworldly voice brings the weight of karmic law to life.  
  
The lyrics unfold like a fable: shadows, secrets, and fleeting moments all reveal the subtle traps woven by past actions. Through verses, we hear tales of words left unmeasured and deeds done in darkness, each carrying an unseen price. The chorus captures the powerful notion that our choices reverberate, casting fragile hearts and filling familiar paths with reminders of our own actions. The bridge poignantly reminds listeners that karma’s wheel turns without mercy, pulling us back to face what we have sown.  
  
Set to a soulful blend of acoustic guitar, rolling basslines, and evocative keyboard notes, *Karma’s Wheel* envelops listeners in a sense of eerie beauty and introspection, making it a modern folk tale that resonates deeply with anyone who has felt the weight of consequence.  
  
[Verse]  
When shadows whisper secrets dark  
And hearts are heavy with their mark  
The echoes of what once was bold  
Will soon return a tale retold  
  
[Verse 2]  
A deed is done in moon's faint light  
A consequence will grip so tight  
The wheels of fate they spin around  
For every wrong a loss is found  
  
[Chorus]  
Bad deeds they boomerang back fast  
In moments fragile hearts are cast  
The suffering it finds a home  
In paths where we once used to roam  
  
[Verse 3]  
A reckless word a fleeting glance  
Will set the stage for second chance  
But karma's wheel it turns so true  
The past will always find what's due  
  
[Bridge]  
You can't escape the seeds you've sown  
In gardens wild they've overgrown  
The tangles twist and pull you near  
Reminding you that fate is clear  
  
[Chorus]  
Bad deeds they boomerang back fast  
In moments fragile hearts are cast  
The suffering it finds a home  
In paths where we once used to roam
