# My Inner Change  
  
(Verse 1)  
Woke up this mornin', saw trouble on the street,  
Pain and confusion, a bitter taste, nothin' sweet.  
This troubled world feels like a heavy, weary place,  
Gonna find my truth, gonna set my soul a-pace.  
  
(Chorus)  
Na-mu Myō-hō Ren-ge Kyō, that's the sound I seek,  
From my deepest heart, to the world my faith I speak.  
Gonna bring peace to the land, from deep inside my soul,  
Gonna live by this Law, gonna make myself whole.  
  
(Verse 2)  
Felt lost in old beliefs, wanderin' through a foggy haze,  
Searchin' for salvation, through those long and sufferin' days.  
But the Lotus Sutra, that "single good doctrine" so clear,  
It's changin' my destiny, banishin' all my fear.  
  
(Bridge)  
Gotta honor life's dignity, that's the path we all should choose,  
Through honest talk, we'll light a way and burn up all the blues.  
When the "three obstacles" come callin', don't you ever be afraid,  
Gotta roar like a lion, never let my hope be swayed.  
  
(Chorus)  
Na-mu Myō-hō Ren-ge Kyō, that's the sound I seek,  
From my deepest heart, to the world my faith I speak.  
Gonna bring peace to the land, from deep inside my soul,  
Gonna live by this Law, gonna make myself whole.  
  
(Outro)  
This inner change, gonna spread it far and wide,  
Turn this weary world, to a joyful place, where peace can truly reside.  
Yeah, peace for the land, that's the mission we pursue,  
With the Gosho as my guide, makin' everything brand new.
