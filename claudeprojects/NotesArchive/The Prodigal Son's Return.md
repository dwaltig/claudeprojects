The Prodigal Son's Return  
  
Verse 1:  
Left my father's house when I was young and strong  
Roamed for fifty years, everything went wrong  
Poverty and shame became my only friends  
Didn't know my story was about to end  
  
Chorus:  
Oh Lord, oh Lord, I didn't recognize  
My father's face, his wealth before my eyes  
Fear and doubt kept me from comin' home  
But his love was patient, wouldn't let me roam  
  
Verse 2:  
Rich man saw me standin' at his gates  
Knew I was his son, but he had to wait  
Gave me menial work, watched me from afar  
Slowly brought me closer, healin' every scar  
  
Chorus:  
Oh Lord, oh Lord, I didn't recognize  
My father's face, his wealth before my eyes  
Fear and doubt kept me from comin' home  
But his love was patient, wouldn't let me roam  
But his love was patient, wouldn't let me roam  
  
Verse 3:  
Twenty years of labor, clearin' piles of dirt  
Father called me "son," but I couldn't assert  
My place beside him, in that mansion grand  
Stuck in my old ways, couldn't understand  
  
Chorus:  
Oh Lord, oh Lord, I didn't recognize  
My father's face, his wealth before my eyes  
Fear and doubt kept me from comin' home  
But his love was patient, wouldn't let me roam  
But his love was patient, wouldn't let me roam  
  
Bridge:  
Then one day he told me, "Son, it's time you knew  
All this wealth and glory, it belongs to you  
You're no longer servant, but my rightful heir  
All these years I've loved you, waited for you here"  
  
Final Chorus:  
Oh Lord, oh Lord, now I recognize  
My father's love, his wisdom in disguise  
Prodigal no longer, I've come home at last  
Buddha's children all, from the distant past
