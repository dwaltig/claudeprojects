# One True Vehicle  
  
  
**[Intro]**  
**(Verse 1)** Three roads appeared, both far and wide, The seeker, the hermit, the selfless guide. But as the lotus starts to bloom, One path unites, beyond the gloom.  
  
**(Chorus)**  
One clay, one potter’s hand, Shaping lives across the land. One way, though minds may roam, The journey leads us all back home.  
  
**(Verse 2)** The wise one sees with deeper sight, Healing hearts lost in the night. With gentle hands, the way is shown, A path for each to call their own.  
  
**(Chorus)** One clay, one potter’s hand, Shaping lives across the land. One way, though minds may roam, The journey leads us all back home.  
  
**(Bridge)** The blind may catch a glimpse of light, Mistaking parts for something right. But guidance brings the whole in view, Revealing all that's pure and true.  
  
**(Verse 3)** There is a note, a hidden sound, That stirs the soul, where truth is found. In silence played, but heard by heart, The secret chord, a work of art.  
  
**(Chorus)** One clay, one potter’s hand, Shaping lives across the land. One way, though minds may roam, The journey leads us all back home.  
  
**(Outro)** No second, no third, just one true call, A single path that holds us all. In every heart, the seed is sown, Awakening life, the world reborn.
