(Verse 1)  
When the dawn breaks,   
the world comes alive,  
Mountains hum a tune,   
let the spirit thrive,  
Rivers roll on,   
singin’ songs of tomorrow,  
In the dance of the day,   
we find our sorrow.  
  
(Chorus)  
[Leader:] Oh, we’re caught in the whispers,  
[Response]: Caught in the whispers, we’re feelin’ the night.  
[Leader:] Fear and uncertainty,  
[Response:] But we’ll find the light.  
[Leader:] With hope as our anchor,  
[Response:] We’ll weather the storm.  
[Leader:] Together we’ll rise,  
[Response:] Keepin’ our hearts warm.  
  
(Verse 2)  
In the shadows of danger, our courage may fade,  
But there’s a flicker of faith that won’t be swayed,  
Every prayer we offer is a step on the way,  
Trustin’ the journey, we’ll make it today.  
  
(Chorus)  
[Leader:] Oh, we’re caught in the whispers,  
[Response]: Caught in the whispers, we’re feelin’ the night.  
[Leader:] Fear and uncertainty,  
[Response:] But we’ll find the light.  
[Leader:] With hope as our anchor,  
[Response:] We’ll weather the storm.  
[Leader:] Together we’ll rise,  
[Response:] Keepin’ our hearts warm.  
  
(Bridge)  
Gratitude blooms like wildflowers in spring,  
In laughter and tears, oh, the joy they bring,  
We’ll dance through the struggles, keepin’ our heads high,  
With each step we take, we learn to fly.  
  
(Verse 3)  
So here’s to the journey, with all its twists and turns,  
Temptations will call, but inside us it burns,  
The strength that we carry, the love that we share,  
In the whispers of existence, we’ll always be there.  
  
(Chorus)  
[Leader:] Oh, we’re caught in the whispers,  
[Response]: Caught in the whispers, we’re feelin’ the night.  
[Leader:] Fear and uncertainty,  
[Response:] But we’ll find the light.  
[Leader:] With hope as our anchor,  
[Response:] We’ll weather the storm.  
[Leader:] Together we’ll rise,  
[Response:] Keepin’ our hearts warm.
