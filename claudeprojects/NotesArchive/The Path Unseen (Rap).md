[Intro]  
Yeah, we all got paths we ride,  
But there's one truth that can’t divide,  
Feel the beat, let it collide,  
One road, one ride, where we all confide.  
  
[Verse 1]  
Three roads ahead, wide open space,  
The seeker, the loner, the one with grace.  
But when that lotus starts to bloom,  
One lane cuts through the shadow and gloom.  
We all out here searching for that clue,  
Different steps, but we move to the same truth.  
Eyes closed, but we open with the sound,  
Realize the path’s always been around.  
  
[Chorus]  
One clay, one potter’s hand,  
Moldin' lives, yeah, across the land.  
One way, no matter how we roam,  
All roads lead us back to home.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Wise eyes, they see through the night,  
Healing hearts, bringin' 'em back to light.  
Gentle touch, but the truth is strong,  
Showin' us the way we’ve been on all along.  
Each of us, we got our own role,  
But the path to the top—it’s the same goal.  
Doesn’t matter what we call it or who,  
One sound, one life, it’s the same truth.  
  
[Chorus]  
One clay, one potter’s hand,  
Moldin' lives, yeah, across the land.  
One way, no matter how we roam,  
All roads lead us back to home.  
  
[Verse 3]  
Yo, there’s a note, it hits so deep,  
Stirs the soul, shakes you outta sleep.  
A silent chord that only hearts can hear,  
The secret sound that draws you near.  
It’s played in the silence, it’s felt, not seen,  
The kinda truth that wipes the whole slate clean.  
  
[Chorus]  
One clay, one potter’s hand,  
Moldin' lives, yeah, across the land.  
One way, no matter how we roam,  
All roads lead us back to home.  
  
[Bridge]  
No second, no third, no need to stall,  
One true call that’s been there for all.  
In every heart, there’s a seed that’s grown,  
Awakening life, the truth we own.  
  
[Reprise Verse 2]  
Wise eyes, they see through the night,  
Healing hearts, bringin' 'em back to light.  
Gentle touch, but the truth is strong,  
Showin' us the way we’ve been on all along.  
  
Each of us, we got our own role,  
But the path to the top—it’s the same goal.  
Doesn’t matter what we call it or who,  
One sound, one life, it’s the same truth.  
  
[Outro]  
They seein' part, mistakin' it for whole,  
Blind to the bigger picture in the soul.  
But when the light breaks, it all gets clear,  
Revealin' the truth that we all hold near.
