# Dust of the Earth Blues  
  
*(Slow finger-picked minor-key groove, 70–80 BPM, slide guitar and a low harmonica moan)*  
  
**Verse 1** I’m a breath on the wind, just a shadow of clay, Every heartbeat borrowed, every dawn a gift of day. King Benjamin sang it, and I feel it in my bones: I’m less than the dust, yet loved more than I’ve known.  
  
**Chorus** Less than the dust of the earth, still the Maker calls my name, Every step I take is mercy, every note pure flame. Can’t repay the Giver, no matter what I do, So I’ll sing these grateful blues and keep my heart true.  
  
**Verse 2** The fields don’t owe the farmer, the rivers don’t pay the rain, Still the harvest keeps on coming, still the rivers sing again. So my soul keeps on owing, with no way to square the score, But grace is the currency, and love keeps opening doors.  
  
**Bridge** *(instrumental break—slide guitar bends like a quiet prayer)* All I can offer is a willing heart and song, Hands to serve my neighbor, and a faith that keeps me strong.  
  
**Final Chorus / Outro** Less than the dust of the earth, yet the heavens clap along, Gratitude my kingdom, obedience my song. I can’t repay the Giver, but I’ll praise Him night and noon, Till the stars fall silent, I’ll be singing Benjamin’s tune.
