Lyrics:   
(Verse 1)  
Woke up this mornin’, blues got me down  
Eighty years of givin’, ain’t earned no crown  
Fed the hungry, clothed the poor, helped ‘em find their way  
But the Buddha said, “Son, there’s a brighter way to play.”  
  
(Chorus)  
Sacred Lotus, oh Mystic Law, you opened up my eyes  
Showed me the truth, hidin’ in plain disguise  
One phrase of wisdom, a spark in the night  
Burns brighter than years of doin’ what I thought was right.  
  
(Verse 2)  
A treasure chest unopened, locked inside my soul  
The Sutra’s golden key turns, now the wisdom makes me whole  
Chased after riches, thought they held the key  
Now I see the real wealth’s in words that set us free.  
  
(Chorus)  
Sacred Lotus, oh Mystic Law, you opened up my eyes  
Showed me the truth, hidin’ in plain disguise  
One phrase of wisdom, it sets my heart alight  
Burns brighter than years of doin’ what I thought was right.  
  
(Bridge)  
The light within us all, it flickers and it fades  
But when we find the Dharma, it burns and it stays  
My friends come to me, with troubles on their mind  
The Lotus whispers softly, brings peace they hope to find.  
  
(Chorus)  
Sacred Lotus, oh Mystic Law, you’ve turned my night to day  
Shined a light on the path, cleared the doubts away  
A single phrase of wisdom, now I finally see  
The Sacred Lotus blooms in you and blooms in me.  
  
(Outro)  
Woke up this mornin’, blues turned to gold  
Eighty years of searchin’, found the truth untold  
Now I’m singin’ a new song, beneath the Dharma moon  
The Timeless Truths changed my life’s tune.
