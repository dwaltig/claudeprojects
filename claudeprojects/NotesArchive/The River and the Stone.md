## The River and the Stone  
  
Once, in a quiet village nestled by a winding river, there lived a young fisherman named Kael. Every morning, Kael would row his small boat to the center of the river, cast his nets, and wait patiently for the fish to come. The river was his teacher—calm some days, wild on others, but always flowing forward.  
  
One day, as Kael sat in his boat, a man from the village stormed to the riverbank, shouting curses. His face was red with rage, and his words were sharp like thorns. “You stole my fishing spot!” the man yelled, shaking his fist. “I’ll ruin your nets for this!” Kael felt a spark of anger flare within him—his spot, stolen? He hadn’t done anything wrong! His hands tightened on the oars, ready to row ashore and argue.  
  
But then Kael looked at the river. Its waters swirled around a jagged stone jutting from the surface. The current didn’t stop to fight the stone—it flowed around it, wearing it down over time, smoothing its edges without force. Kael took a deep breath and loosened his grip. He called out to the man, “The river’s big enough for us both. Take the spot today—I’ll find another.”  
  
The angry man blinked, startled by the calm reply. His shouting faltered, then stopped. He muttered something under his breath and sat down to fish, still glowering but no longer raging. Kael rowed downstream, found a new spot, and caught more fish than he had in weeks.  
  
Years later, the stone in the river was gone, smoothed away by the patient water. And the man from the village? He became one of Kael’s closest friends, often laughing about the day he’d lost his temper.
