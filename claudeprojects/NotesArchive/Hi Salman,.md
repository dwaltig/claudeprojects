**Hi Salman,**  
  
Thanks for the recent push on Facebook and Instagram. Before we move forward, I need clarity on three points:  
	1.	**Reach vs. Engagement**  
	•	Facebook : 51 000 views last week but only 55 interactions (≈ 0.1 %).  
	•	Instagram : 26 000 views but only 36 interactions (≈ 0.14 %).  
Healthy organic content usually lands in the 0.5–2 % range. Please explain why engagement is so low.  
	2.	**Follower Churn**  
	•	Instagram added 669 followers but lost 329 the same week (≈ 50 % churn).  
This pattern often comes from mass‑follow/unfollow or low‑quality accounts. What tactics produced these numbers?  
	3.	**Proof of Promotion Method**  
	•	Send post‑level insights (reach, likes, top locations).  
	•	Provide ad IDs or spend summaries if you boosted anything.  
	•	If you used emails, groups, or shout‑outs, list the sources.  
Transparency is essential; Spotify has already flagged abnormal activity once, and I won’t risk repeating that on Meta platforms.  
  
***Action items (due ____ April 25th, Friday):***  
	•	Post‑level screenshots for the content that drove the spike.  
	•	Audience‑growth chart screenshots (FB & IG).  
	•	Written summary of exactly how each promotion was executed.  
  
If these numbers are organic and policy‑compliant, great—we’ll keep scaling.  
If not, we need to pivot immediately to fully transparent tactics (as outlined in our recent letter).  
  
Thank you for addressing this promptly.
