# Refection of Love	  
  
[Verse]  
[Verse]  
[Verse]  
[Verse]  
[Verse]  
In the mirror of life  
What do you see?  
A reflection of doubt or a soul flying free?  
Gaze deep within  
Through the eyes of your heart  
For your journey begins where self-love must start  
  
[Chorus]  
[Chorus]  
[Chorus]  
[Chorus]  
[Chorus]  
[Chorus]  
No one can alter the worth that you hold  
For your story is yours  
Uniquely untold  
The power within you  
A force like no other  
Nourished by kindness  
Will help you discover  
  
[Verse 2]  
Be gentle  
Be loving  
Embrace who you are  
A being of light  
A resplendent star  
Shine bright  
My dear  
With unyielding grace  
As self-compassion illuminates your face
