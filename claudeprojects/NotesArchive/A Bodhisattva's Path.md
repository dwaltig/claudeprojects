# A Bodhisattva's Path  
  
A Bodhisattva's **heart**, a boundless vow,   
To ease all suffering, **here and now**.   
Yet inner struggles rise, the **self's old chains**,   
Engaging drama, born of worldly pains.   
In this **"evil age,"** where shadows creep,   
A sacred mission, promises to keep.  
  
The path unfolds, through **Dhyāna's grace**,   
A training of the mind, a tranquil space.   
Like purifying fire, it **burns away**,   
To insight's clarity, and lights the day.   
This **foundation deep**, where wisdom seeds,   
To nurture wholesome thoughts and virtuous deeds.  
  
Seek **"retired place,"** beyond the strife,   
A haven for the inner, quiet life.   
No mere escape, but strength within to find,   
To steady thought, and calm the restless mind.   
Though world may clamor, with its constant sound,   
True stillness in the **inner self** is found.  
  
The **"Three Poisons"** rise, from darkest root,   
Delusion's pig, bearing bitter fruit.   
Attachment's bird, clinging to joy's fleeting gleam,   
Aversion's snake, a hostile, poisoned dream.   
These **"cognitive distortions,"** clouding sight,   
Obscure the truth, and shroud the inner light.  
  
But **Dhyāna's depth**, transforms the soul,   
Towards wisdom, generosity, makes whole.   
**Great Compassion** blooms, the Buddha's heart,   
Through Tonglen's breath, playing a healing part.   
Releasing grasping, letting ego cease,   
To find true non-attachment, **inner peace**.  
  
With **Samatha's calm**, the mind grows clear,   
**Vipassanā's insight**, banishes all fear.   
Concentration stable, truths revealed,   
A vision pure, the interconnected field.   
For **wisdom blossoms**, from Dhyāna's art,   
And fuels the **Bodhisattva's boundless heart**.  
  
All suffering's root, within the mind resides,   
The inner answer, where liberation hides.   
Through **"peaceful practices,"** steadfast and true,   
A transformed being, arises fresh and new.   
To benefit all beings, in profoundest ways,   
Illuminating the **Buddha Way's bright blaze**.
