# Old Born of the Young  
  
“Blues-folk ballad in G minor, 12/8 shuffle, acoustic guitar lead, upright bass, brushed drums, harmonica interludes, male lead with soulful gospel-style backing on choruses, dynamic bridge with organ swell, fade-out outro.”  
	•	Layer three takes of the chorus harmonies for depth (one low, one unison, one high falsetto or female blend).  
  
**[Intro – 8 bars (instrumental)**  
	•	Solo finger-picked acoustic guitar in a slow 6/8 or 12/8 blues feel (think a traveling-river shuffle).  
	•	Add a single harmonica line in bar 5 to foreshadow the “freight train’s mournful sound.”]  
  
**[Verse 1 – 16 bars**  
	•	Light percussion (kick on 1 & 4, soft brushes).  
	•	Vocal center stage, guitar steady, harmonica faint.]  
  
(Verse 1)  
Well, the dusty road behind me, it's a hundred years long  
Felt I knew the whole story, but it seems I was wrong  
Met a young man on the highway, with eyes old and deep  
Said, "That hundred-year-old traveler, well, that's a son of mine to keep."  
Oh, my mind started reeling, my reason came undone  
Said, "How can the father be younger than the son?"  
  
**[Chorus 1 – 8 bars**  
	•	Bass enters with a walking line.  
	•	Harmony vocals (low male or mixed choir) on “It’s the blues of the long, long road…” to emphasize the question.]  
  
(Chorus)  
It's the blues of the long, long road, a question on my tongue  
How can the old be born of the young?  
The Buddha's words, they echoed, like a freight train's mournful sound  
Said, "The truth I see, my friend, is not the truth you have found."  
  
[**Verse 2 – 16 bars**  
	•	Bring in subtle mandolin or slide guitar answering lines.  
	•	Keep percussion steady but add a rim click to build momentum.]  
  
(Verse 2)  
Maitreya, the future Buddha, he stood there by my side  
He said, "World-Honored One, I don't know where to hide.  
This is a riddle for the ages, a paradox so grand,  
How can the teacher be the student in this mystic land?"  
And a voice, soft as moonlight, said, "You've got to ask and see,  
'Cause the doubt in your heart is the key to findin' me."  
  
**[Chorus 2 – 8 bars**  
	•	Full backing vocals for a gospel-blues lift.  
	•	Harmonica punctuates the final two bars with that train-whistle bend.]  
  
(Chorus)  
It's the blues of the long, long road, a question on my tongue  
How can the old be born of the young?  
The Buddha's words, they echoed, like a freight train's mournful sound  
Said, "The truth I see, my friend, is not the truth you have found."  
  
[**Bridge – 16 bars**  
	•	Drop the drums for the first 8 bars—just bass, guitar, and soft organ pad to create mystery.  
	•	Reintroduce full band in the second 8 bars, slow crescendo to a peak.]  
  
(Bridge)  
He spoke of the underground, where the faithful wait to rise  
And of a timeless doctor who taught them with no lies.  
He spoke of coming and of going, of life and of the end,  
Said, "I only act like I'm leaving, to teach you all, my friend."  
This world's a hospital, and we're the ailing ones,  
He's been here all along, tending to his sons.  
  
**[Chorus 3 – 8 bars**  
	•	Strongest vocal delivery, full choir backing.]  
  
(Chorus)  
It's the blues of the long, long road, a question on my tongue  
How can the old be born of the young?  
The Buddha's words, they echoed, like a freight train's mournful sound  
Said, "The truth I see, my friend, is not the truth you have found."  
  
**[Outro – 12–16 bars**  
	•	Fade instruments gradually while the lead guitar and harmonica trade slow melodic echoes.  
	•	Finish on a sustained vocal tag:  
“Now I know the old man’s story… told by the truly young.”]  
  
(Outro)  
So, I'll tune my old guitar, in the twilight's fading glow,  
And I'll sing of the one who's here, no matter where we go.  
The Wonderful Dharma's music, a tune both old and new,  
And that sincere old question, well, it's been my saving glue.  
Oh, it's the blues of the long, long road, a question on my tongue,  
But now I know the old man's story, told by the truly young.
