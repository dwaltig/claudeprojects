[Verse 1]  
In the silence of the night,   
In the silence of the night,   
through the struggles and the strife,  
With a heart that’s full of hope,   
With a heart that’s full of hope,   
we hold on to the light.  
Though the road is long and steep,   
Though the road is long and steep,   
every promise we will keep,  
For the arc of justice bends,   
For the arc of justice bends,   
towards the dream we seek.  
  
[Chorus]  
In the patience of justice,   
In the patience of justice,   
the arc bends to the right,  
Through the shadows of the darkness,   
Through the shadows of the darkness,   
we will find the light.  
With faith and with courage,   
With faith and with courage,   
we stand in unity,  
For the arc of the universe bends towards liberty.  
  
[Verse 2]  
With the teachings of the wise,   
With the teachings of the wise,   
in our hearts we realize,  
That every step we take,   
That every step we take,   
brings us closer to the skies.  
In the Dharma’s gentle way,   
In the Dharma’s gentle way,   
we find the strength to say,  
That the arc of justice bends,   
That the arc of justice bends,   
towards a brighter day.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[Bridge]  
Hand in hand we walk together,   
Hand in hand we walk together,   
with a vision pure and true,  
In the patience of the ages,   
In the patience of the ages,   
we will see it through.  
With compassion as our guide,   
With compassion as our guide,   
we’ll let the truth abide,  
For the arc of justice bends,   
For the arc of justice bends,   
to where the hopes reside.  
  
[Chorus]  
In the patience of justice,   
In the patience of justice,   
the arc bends to the right,  
Through the shadows of the darkness,   
Through the shadows of the darkness,   
we will find the light.  
With faith and with courage,   
With faith and with courage,   
we stand in unity,  
For the arc of the universe bends towards liberty.  
For the arc of the universe bends towards liberty.
