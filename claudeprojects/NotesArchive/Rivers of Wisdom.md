## Rivers of Wisdom  
Verse 1: In the silence of the dawn I hear a whisper on the breeze Ancient words, newly born Flowing through the trees  
Chorus: We're all rivers, running to the sea Different paths, same destiny In the light of the rising sun We find we're all one  
Verse 2: Rich man, poor man, saint and sinner All searching for the truth within The wise one says with a gentle smile "The journey ends where we begin"  
(Chorus)  
Bridge: Clay in the potter's hands Takes many forms, but understands Every shape, every design Comes from love divine  
Verse 3: So let your light shine bright In the darkness of the night For the wisdom of the ages Lives in you and me  
(Chorus)  
Outro: We're all rivers, can't you see? Flowing to the same sea In the light of the setting sun We find we're all one
