# A Kindness Built to Last  
  
**A Kindness Built to Last** is a bluesy folk journey of quiet strength and shared humanity.  
With warm guitar grooves and a soul-deep chorus, the song calls us to turn struggle into courage, to discover the ever-present spirit within, and to let compassion shine outward.  
  
From heavy burdens and lonely nights to an inner fire that lights the way, each verse celebrates steadfast mercy, everyday dignity, and the power of giving.  
The hook says it all: *“The strength that guards your footsteps when the storms come fast—it’s the love you give to others, a kindness built to last.”*  
  
This track is both a personal anthem and a communal prayer—a reminder that the real lantern isn’t out there, it’s already burning in every heart.  
  
Lyrics:   
**(Verse 1)**  
Got these heavy burdens, a world of pain and strife,  
People keep on fighting, lost inside a troubled life.  
Then a quiet whisper, a low and soulful sound,  
Said, *“The truth you’re seeking is everywhere around.”*  
I reached for some bright lantern to pierce the endless night,  
But the fire was in my chest, a steady, guiding light.  
  
**(Chorus)**  
Oh, the wisdom lives inside you, the truth is plain to see,  
An ever-present spirit just waiting to break free.  
The strength that guards your footsteps when the storms come fast—  
It’s the love you give to others, a kindness built to last.  
  
**(Verse 2)**  
There’s a gentle spirit, steadfast, strong, and bold,  
Like a mighty river, a story ages old.  
It walks the road of giving, stands firm against the wrong,  
Keeps its purpose steady, sings a quiet song.  
When the shadow creeps in and the doubts begin to bite,  
Call up every virtue—let them blaze against the night.  
  
**(Chorus)**  
Oh, the wisdom lives inside you, the truth is plain to see,  
An ever-present spirit just waiting to break free.  
The strength that guards your footsteps when the storms come fast—  
It’s the love you give to others, a kindness built to last.  
  
**(Verse 3)**  
We’re all on one long highway, every soul and creed,  
Planting seeds of goodness, tending every need.  
My own joy’s unfinished till your burden’s eased;  
I’ll walk beside you, friend, to bring you peace.  
I’ll honor every stranger, every face I meet,  
Show quiet reverence on the busy, winding street.  
  
**(Bridge)**  
This world of clash and thunder is no place to flee—  
It’s the forge of courage, for you and for me.  
Turn the bitter poison into medicine sweet;  
Make each trial your mission, rise on your feet.  
Change begins within you, where kindness burns bright,  
Building peace right here, in the heart of the fight.  
  
**(Chorus – Final)**  
Oh, the wisdom lives inside you, the truth is plain to see,  
An ever-present spirit just waiting to break free.  
The strength that guards your footsteps when the storms come fast—  
It’s the love you give to others, a kindness built to last.  
  
**(Outro)**  
So walk this path of practice, let your own light shine through;  
Be the comfort you were waiting for—let the world find it in you.  
Be that quiet shelter in all you say and do.
