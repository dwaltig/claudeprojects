#   
  
(Verse 1)  
I’ve walked the road of sorrow,  
With guilt upon my mind,  
Apologies so hollow,  
Just to leave the past behind.  
But I’ve learned a deeper lesson,  
From the wise who’ve shown the way,  
An apology with wisdom,  
Lights the darkest day.  
  
(Chorus)  
So I’ll say I’m sorry,  
Not to please, not to flee,  
But to heal the hearts I’ve wounded,  
And set my spirit free.  
With compassion as my guide,  
And wisdom as my friend,  
I’ll walk the path of truth,  
Until the very end.  
  
(Verse 2)  
In the quiet of reflection,  
I’ve seen the pain I’ve caused,  
And with a heart of kindness,  
I’ll mend the broken laws.  
For every tear that’s fallen,  
For every silent cry,  
An apology with meaning,  
Will lift our spirits high.  
  
(Chorus)  
So I’ll say I’m sorry,  
Not to please, not to flee,  
But to heal the hearts I’ve wounded,  
And set my spirit free.  
With compassion as my guide,  
And wisdom as my friend,  
I’ll walk the path of truth,  
Until the very end.  
  
{instrumental]  
  
(Bridge)  
It’s not about perfection,  
But the courage to make amends,  
To walk the path of love,  
Where every journey ends.  
  
(Chorus)  
So I’ll say I’m sorry,  
Not to please, not to flee,  
But to heal the hearts I’ve wounded,  
And set my spirit free.  
With compassion as my guide,  
And wisdom as my friend,  
I’ll walk the path of truth,  
Until the very end.  
  
(Outro)  
With compassion as my guide,  
And wisdom as my friend,  
I’ll walk the path of truth,  
Until the very end.  
  
[End]
