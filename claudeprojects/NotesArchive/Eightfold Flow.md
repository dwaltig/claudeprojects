# Eightfold Flow  
  
[Intro]  
Yo, listen up, it's time to know  
The path to enlightenment, let it grow  
Eight steps to wisdom, don't you forget  
The Buddha's guidance, you won't regret  
  
[Verse 1 - Right Understanding]  
I'm on a mission, to understand the way  
See through the illusion, night and day  
Ignorance is darkness, knowledge is light  
Right understanding, shining bright  
  
[Chorus]  
Eightfold Path, the journey's long  
But with each step, I'm getting strong  
Mindful and focused, I'm on the grind  
Eightfold Path, leaving the past behind  
  
[Verse 2 - Right Intention]  
My intention's pure, no room for hate  
Compassion and love, that's my state  
Renounce the negativity, let it fade  
Right intention, the path I've made  
  
[Chorus]  
Eightfold Path, the journey's long  
But with each step, I'm getting strong  
Mindful and focused, I'm on the grind  
Eightfold Path, leaving the past behind  
  
[Verse 3 - Right Speech]  
Words have power, I choose them wise  
No gossip, no lies, just truth in my eyes  
Speak from the heart, with kindness and care  
Right speech, showing empathy's there  
  
[Chorus]  
Eightfold Path, the journey's long  
But with each step, I'm getting strong  
Mindful and focused, I'm on the grind  
Eightfold Path, leaving the past behind  
  
[Verse 4 - Right Action]  
My actions reflect, the person I am  
No harm to others, that's my plan  
Compassion in motion, that's my goal  
Right action, taking control  
  
[Chorus]  
Eightfold Path, the journey's long  
But with each step, I'm getting strong  
Mindful and focused, I'm on the grind  
Eightfold Path, leaving the past behind  
  
[Verse 5 - Right Livelihood]  
My work's a reflection, of my values true  
No harm to others, that's what I pursue  
Ethical and fair, that's my aim  
Right livelihood, no room for shame  
  
[Chorus]  
Eightfold Path, the journey's long  
But with each step, I'm getting strong  
Mindful and focused, I'm on the grind  
Eightfold Path, leaving the past behind  
  
[Verse 6 - Right Effort]  
I strive to improve, with each new day  
Letting go of negativity, in every way  
Cultivating positivity, that's my quest  
Right effort, doing my best  
  
[Chorus]  
Eightfold Path, the journey's long  
But with each step, I'm getting strong  
Mindful and focused, I'm on the grind  
Eightfold Path, leaving the past behind  
  
[Verse 7 - Right Mindfulness]  
I'm present in the moment, no distractions here  
Focused on my breath, calm and clear  
Aware of my thoughts, but not controlled  
Right mindfulness, my inner peace unfold  
  
[Chorus]  
Eightfold Path, the journey's long  
But with each step, I'm getting strong  
Mindful and focused, I'm on the grind  
Eightfold Path, leaving the past behind  
  
[Verse 8 - Right Concentration]  
My mind's a laser beam, focused and bright  
Concentrating on wisdom, day and night  
No room for doubts, or distractions too  
Right concentration, my wisdom shines through  
  
[Outro]  
Now you know the path, that I've designed  
Eightfold Path, the journey's mine  
Walk with me, and let's grow strong  
Together on the path, where we all belong.
