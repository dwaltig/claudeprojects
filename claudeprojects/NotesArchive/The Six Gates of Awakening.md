# The Six Gates of Awakening  
  
Within each being, a Buddha sleeps —    
First as principle, a seed unnoticed,    
Buried in the soil of ordinary mind.  
  
Then awakened by name, the first tender shoot    
Breaking through confusion's crust,    
We learn to call what was always there.  
  
In contemplation's quiet garden,    
We nurture understanding with patient breath.    
Roots deepen, stems strengthen, leaves unfold.  
  
Semblance blooms like sudden flowers —    
For moments, we glimpse our true reflection    
In the clear pond of awareness.  
  
Partial realization ripens the fruit,    
Sweet with compassion, firm with wisdom,    
The branch begins to bear what the root always promised.  
  
Ultimate identity — beyond all telling —    
The seed becomes the forest,    
The drop returns to ocean.  
  
Six gates, one journey.    
Six faces of a single jewel.    
The Buddha you seek    
Has been walking your path    
All along.
