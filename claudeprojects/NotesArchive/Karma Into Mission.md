# Karma Into Mission  
  
(Verse 1)  
Woke up this morning, felt the weight of time roll on,  
Every wrong road, every silent tear, the night was nearly gone.  
They call it karma, a debt that must be paid,  
But it’s just the echoes of the choices that I made.  
I was a prisoner, hummin’ a lonesome tune,  
A blues-born melody beneath a fading moon.  
  
(Chorus)  
But the lotus bloomed in the muddy ground, a fire began to shine,  
I took my karma, laid a brand-new hand on the line.  
It ain’t about the past, no debt I’ve got to clear,  
It’s a living purpose, washing away the fear.  
This ain’t my burden, it’s the clay I get to shape,  
From the ruins of the old, a brand-new song escapes.  
Yeah, my karma’s a mission now, a story to unfold,  
A brand-new chapter for my soul, more precious than pure gold.  
  
(Verse 2)  
The old folks said, “Son, you reap just what you sow.”  
And I believed ‘em, watched a bitter harvest grow.  
But a whisper found me in the stillness of the night:  
“Your past ain’t a prison, it’s a lantern burning bright.”  
The heartbreak I’ve known, the lessons hard-won,  
They’re the verses to my song beneath the rising sun.  
  
(Chorus)  
‘Cause the lotus bloomed in the muddy ground, a fire began to shine,  
I took my karma, laid a brand-new hand on the line.  
It ain’t about the past, no debt I’ve got to clear,  
It’s a living purpose, washing away the fear.  
This ain’t my burden, it’s the clay I get to shape,  
From the ruins of the old, a brand-new song escapes.  
Yeah, my karma’s a mission now, a story to unfold,  
A brand-new chapter for my soul, more precious than pure gold.  
  
(Bridge)  
Some folks hide from shadows, try to drink away the pain,  
But I’m walking straight into it, dancing in the rain.  
Every stumble, every scar, every fall I bear,  
Turns into wisdom, a kindness I can share.  
  
(Chorus)  
And the lotus bloomed in the muddy ground, a fire began to shine,  
I took my karma, laid a brand-new hand on the line.  
It ain’t about the past, no debt I’ve got to clear,  
It’s a living purpose, washing away the fear.  
This ain’t my burden, it’s the clay I get to shape,  
From the ruins of the old, a brand-new song escapes.  
Yeah, my karma’s a mission now, a story to unfold,  
A brand-new chapter for my soul, more precious than pure gold.  
  
(Outro)  
A brand-new chapter for my soul,  
More precious than pure gold.  
Karma into mission, the story still untold.
