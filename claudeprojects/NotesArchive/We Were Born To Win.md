[Verse]  
Got a heart like a lion soul that's on fire  
In the ashes we'll find our desire  
No chains can hold us down no never again  
In this game of life we were born to win  
  
[Verse 2]  
Dust on my boots dreams in my skin  
Road's been rough but we don't give in  
Through the trials and the pain we rise again  
Look in my eyes you know we were born to win  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh we were born to win baby can't you see  
Gonna ride the storm just you and me  
With every beat of the drum feel it deep within  
Ain't no mistake honey we were born to win  
  
[Verse 3]  
Night may be dark but the heart is bright  
Stars in the sky gonna guide us right  
Lost in the blues but not in vain  
Through thunder and rain we were born to gain  
  
[Bridge]  
Guitar's wailing like a wolf on the prowl  
Soul's a howlin just can't throw in the towel  
In this dance of fate we spin and spin  
Heads held high you know we were born to win  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh we were born to win baby can't you see  
Gonna ride the storm just you and me  
With every beat of the drum feel it deep within  
Ain't no mistake honey we were born to win
