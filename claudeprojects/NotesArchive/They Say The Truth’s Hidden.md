# They Say The Truth’s Hidden  
  
Verse 1:  
I been walkin' in the shadows, searchin' for the light,  
Tryna find clarity in the dead of night.  
Right view’s elusive, slips through my hands,  
But I know there’s a treasure buried deep in this land.  
  
They say the truth’s hidden, gotta dig deep,  
Past the doubts, the fears that I keep.  
Then like a tower risin' from the ground,  
A stūpa of wisdom where peace is found.  
  
Chorus:  
Yeah, right view and treasure, they come from inside,  
In a world full of conflict, that’s where they hide.  
Buddha and bodhisattvas watchin' my step,  
Guiding me through with every concept.  
  
Verse 2:  
From countless worlds, they gather around,  
Buddhas from the cosmos, they don’t make a sound.  
Many-Treasures Buddha, he gives that nod,  
Sayin’ “Equality’s truth, the path to God.”  
  
It’s a teaching of wisdom, that cuts through the lies,  
Shows the Buddha-nature behind these eyes.  
In each soul, a stūpa ready to rise,  
In the face of delusion, we see through disguise.  
  
Chorus:  
Right view and treasure, yeah, they start from within,  
The path to awakening’s where we begin.  
With eyes wide open, illusions break free,  
Revealing the truth that was hidden in me.  
  
Bridge:  
Look inside, yeah, that’s where it’s at,  
Buddha’s in the heart, no doubt, that’s fact.  
Mount Gṛdhrakūṭa, they’re callin' me in,  
To open the door, let the light begin.  
  
Śākyamuni speaks, sayin' it’s time to see,  
In the Lotus Sutra, that’s where it’ll be.  
With every right view, and every clear sight,  
The treasure unfolds, in the dead of the night.  
  
Verse 3:  
So I’m diggin' for the truth, yeah, I’m goin' in,  
Through the layers of pain, to the light within.  
This stūpa of treasures, risin' high,  
In a world full of sorrow, under an open sky.  
  
Yeah, Many-Treasures tells me, “Don’t you fall,”  
The wisdom you need is inside us all.  
Śākyamuni’s blessing, I feel it strong,  
In the beat of my heart, like a lifelong song.  
  
Chorus:  
Right view and treasure, they’re jewels in the soul,  
Breakin' through illusions, makin' us whole.  
With each revelation, I find what’s true,  
The light of the Buddha, it’s me and you.  
  
Outro:  
So here’s to the journey, the struggle, the fight,  
To see with right view, bring truth to the light.  
In a world of delusion, where shadows creep,  
The treasure is the wisdom that we always keep.
