Maya, a first-time published poet, basks in the afterglow of her recent accomplishment and wonders about what comes next. She finds herself at the edge of the world where time and space intertwine, and there she meets Hephaestus, the Greek god of fire and forge. He greets her with warmth and familiarity and leads her into his celestial workshop, which is filled with wondrous creations. He tells her that her book of poems has rippled through the multiverse, bringing forth profound changes.  
  
Hephaestus shows Maya a magnificent device, a looking glass through which she can see her life over the next decade and the influence her words will have on humanity. He reveals that her journey will take her through the Ten Worlds, transcending from one realm to another.  
  
In the first year, Maya ascends from hell to the realm of hungry ghosts. Although she is freer than before, she is still haunted by insatiable desires. As the second year unfolds, Maya's transformative poetry lifts her into the world of animals, where she marvels at the Earth's wonders as if seeing them for the first time.  
  
By the third year, Maya is completely overwhelmed by the world's diversity, ultimately rising to the realm of powerful Titans in the fourth year. However, it is in the fifth year that her poetic words truly work their magic, elevating her world from the might of Titans to the compassion and wisdom of humanity.  
  
In the sixth year, humanity transforms into the gods of ancient times, while the seventh year sees them transcending these six worlds, learning the intricate web of causes and intentions that bring fruition to their lives. As the eighth year arrives, humanity masters wisdom for themselves, and in the ninth year, they do so for others as well.  
  
Finally, in the tenth year, humanity begins to share their wisdom with the universe, resonating as one harmonious entity. As Hephaestus finishes his narration, Maya's heart swells with gratitude, for she realizes that her simple poems have indeed made a difference.  
  
With a newfound sense of purpose and determination, Maya embarks on this ten-year journey alongside Hephaestus, guided by the power of her words and the wisdom of the Lotus Sutra. Together, they witness the transformation of worlds and the true potential of the human spirit.

Through her compassionate presence and poetic words, Maya helps Amara confront her past heartaches and discover self-love. She also encounters Kael, a restless spirit trapped in a cycle of seeking material wealth and possessions.
