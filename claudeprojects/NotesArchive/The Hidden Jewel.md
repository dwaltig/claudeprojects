A man in need, a friend's kind deed

Shared warmth and comfort, in this strange land

As slumber claimed him, deep and sound   
His friend's kind hands moved without sound

A jewel sewn in, with loving care  
Into his cloak, a treasure rare  
Into his cloak, a treasure rare

Oh, the hidden jewel, deep inside

Covered in dust, where dreams reside

Unaware of the wealth he possessed

In tattered clothes, his soul undressed

He drifted on, through streets unknown

A heavy heart, a spirit forlorn

The jewel lay hidden, its worth untold

A forgotten treasure, in the night's cold

**Bridge:**  
A chance encounter, years later still  
The friend's words pierced like a healing pill  
"Remember that night? I sewed it there,  
The jewel in your cloak, beyond compare"  
The jewel in your cloak, beyond compare"

Eyes wide open, the truth unfurled  
A wealth untold, a brand new world  
The hidden treasure, at last revealed  
A life of riches, no longer concealed  
A life of riches, no longer concealed

Covered in dust, where dreams reside

Awakened now, his true worth confessed

In shining light, his soul blessed

So let us: search, within our own hearts   
So let us: search, within our own hearts   
So let us: search, within our own hearts

For the hidden jewel, that sets us apart

May we awaken, to the light within   
May we awaken, to the light within   
And find the treasure, where true joy begins
