I’m getting ready to leave FNCC. This has bee a great experience. I’m very happy to get an answer to a prayer I’ve had for over a year, and for which I’ve chanted several million daimoku. And the even more fantastic thing is that it was we’ve had the means all this time. No prayer goes unanswered with this practice. I wrote a letter of gratitude to Sensei. I’ve never done something like that. I don’t know if he will ever see it but future generations will and my faith expands by sharing.
