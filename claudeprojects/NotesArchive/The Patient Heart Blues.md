# The Patient Heart Blues  
  
**"The Patient Heart Blues" - A Song About Standing Strong While Walking Away**  
Sometimes the hardest thing in the world is knowing when to stay and when to go. This song came from studying an ancient Buddhist text about patience—but not the kind of patience where you just take whatever comes. Real patience, the kind that refuses to break.  
The Buddha said when people come at you with "swords, sticks, and stones," you should be patient. But here's the twist: being patient doesn't mean being a doormat. It means having such unshakable inner strength that you don't need to hit back—AND being wise enough to protect yourself and walk away when you need to.  
This is a Delta/Chicago blues tune about three kinds of strength:  
* Handling your own hard times without falling apart  
* Staying calm when people try to bring you down  
* Understanding that there's no permanent "you" to protect anyway  
The message is simple: You can have a loving heart AND strong boundaries. You can refuse to let hate win AND refuse to let people hurt you. You can be compassionate toward someone's potential while still protecting yourself from their actions.  
Built on traditional 12-bar blues structure with harmonica, resonator guitar, and a whole lot of lived-in wisdom. For anyone who's ever had to choose between their peace and someone else's chaos.  
Sometimes walking away IS the strongest thing you can do.  
  
**Inspired by scholarly analysis of the Lotus Sutra, Chapter 10** **For everyone who's still learning to put themselves first without losing their heart**

Lyrics:   
(Verse 1)  
Well, they comin’ at me with their sticks and stones,  
Yeah, they comin’ at me with their sticks and stones,  
But I got a strength inside that won’t leave my bones.  
  
(Verse 2)  
Buddha told me, “Son, you think of me,”  
Buddha told me, “Child, you think of me,”  
When the world gets mean, that’s when you’re finally free.  
  
(Chorus)  
‘Cause patience ain’t about just takin’ the hit,  
No, patience ain’t about just takin’ the hit,  
It’s standin’ so strong that you refuse to quit.  
  
(Verse 3)  
Now they call me names and they wish me harm,  
Yeah, they call me names and they wish me harm,  
But I keep my center, I keep my calm.  
  
(Verse 4)  
See, anger’s just a poison in your own sweet cup,  
That anger’s just a poison in your own sweet cup,  
You drink that down, you’re the one messed up.  
  
(Chorus)  
But patience ain’t about just takin’ the hit,  
No, patience ain’t about just takin’ the hit,  
It’s standin’ so strong that you refuse to quit.  
  
(Bridge - Spoken/Half-sung)  
Now listen here, I got somethin’ to say,  
‘Bout compassion and boundaries and findin’ your way—  
You can love somebody’s soul, their light divine,  
But still walk away when they cross that line.  
  
(Verse 5)  
I built me a fence, strong and tall,  
Yeah, I built me a fence, strong and tall,  
Keeps me safe and keeps them from their fall.  
  
(Verse 6)  
’Cause if I let ’em hurt me, they hurt themselves more,  
If I let ‘em hurt me, they hurt themselves more,  
That’s just how karma settles the score.  
  
(Chorus)  
See, patience ain’t about just takin’ the hit,  
No, patience ain’t about just takin’ the hit,  
It’s lovin’ so deep but you still don’t quit.  
  
(Verse 7)  
Three kinds of patience, that’s what I found,  
Yeah, three kinds of patience Buddha laid down,  
Face your own pain, handle folks’ mean sound,  
And know ain’t nothin’ permanent on this ground.  
  
(Verse 8)  
When you realize there ain’t no “you” to defend,  
When you realize there ain’t no “you” to defend,  
That’s when the sufferin’ finally ends.  
  
(Final Chorus)  
‘Cause patience ain’t about just takin’ the hit,  
No, patience ain’t about just takin’ the hit,  
It’s fire in your belly sayin’ “I won’t quit,”  
It’s wisdom in your heart knowin’ when to split,  
It’s lovin’ the world while you still protect it.  
  
(Outro)  
So when them swords come swingin’, when them stones start flyin’,  
When them swords come swingin’, when them stones start flyin’,  
I’m walkin’ away strong—ain’t no use in cryin’,  
Got a patient heart, yeah, and that ain’t no lyin’.  
  
[Harmonica wail]
