# The Lotus's Call  
  
The Lotus unfolds, a universal call,   
Awakening all, transcending suffering's wall.   
A **"clear cool pond"** for every thirsty soul,   
Its joyful acceptance makes the spirit whole.  
  
**The Buddha's Truth**  
  
Maitreya's question, of blessings pure and vast,   
The Buddha revealed a truth designed to last.   
More than great givers, with treasures beyond count,   
The fiftieth hearer, from this blessed fount.   
For joyful reception, even a single verse,   
Exceeds all charity, reversing the curse.  
  
**Inherent Joy and Spaciousness**  
  
This joy, not born of desire's fleeting gain,   
But inherent within us, washes clean all stain.   
When delusion and attachment are shed,   
A spaciousness blooms, where fear is no longer fed.   
It brings vitality, connecting us to life's core,   
A prerequisite for awakening, and so much more.  
  
**Seeing as the Buddha Sees**  
  
Then seeing the world as the Buddha does, unfolds,   
The true nature of reality, from ancient scrolls.   
No separate essence, for **sunyata's deep art**,   
All things interconnected, playing their part.   
Letting go of thought, "name and form" disappear,   
The world **"just as it is,"** makes Buddha Dharma clear.  
  
**Wisdom, Compassion, and Vow**  
  
With wisdom's keen insight, and compassion's wide embrace,   
Two wings of a bird, finding their true place.   
From **"living by karma,"** where self dictates the way,   
To **"living by vow,"** greeting each new day.   
For all life is connected, a profound, shared fate,   
A Bodhisattva's purpose, opening wisdom's gate.  
  
**The Sutra's Core Design**  
  
A change in one's heart, the Sutra's core design,   
Can transform everything, making all divine.   
A vibrant courage, dispelling every fear,   
A chorus of joy, for freedom is here.   
This internal shift, for peace and happiness it springs,  
Collective evolution, the purified realm it brings.
