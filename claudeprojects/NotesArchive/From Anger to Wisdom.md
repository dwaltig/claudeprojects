Lyrics:  
  
[Verse 1]  
I felt the fire inside me,   
burning bright and wild,  
A storm of rage was brewing,   
like a tempest in a child,  
But I knew there was a lesson,   
in every angry wave,  
A path that led to freedom,   
and the wisdom to be brave.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, anger turned to ashes,   
when I learned to let it go,  
Found peace in deeper waters,   
where the wise and gentle flow,  
From the flame into the quiet,   
where my heart can find release,  
Transforming anger into wisdom,   
turning pain into peace.  
  
[Verse 2]  
I saw my past frustrations,   
rising like the tide,  
Echoes of the moments   
when I felt pushed aside,  
But through the eyes of wisdom,   
I saw the truth was clear,  
That peace comes from forgiving,   
and love is always near.  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh, wisdom is a river,   
flowing calm and deep,  
It can cool the hottest anger,   
and put the storm to sleep,  
In the silence of reflection,   
I found the better way,  
To turn my wrath to kindness,   
and let compassion play.  
  
[Verse 3]  
Now I walk the path of stillness,   
where anger cannot tread,  
Where wisdom lights the journey,   
and peace lies just ahead,  
Each step I take with patience,   
each breath I take with grace,  
I’m learning from my anger,   
and finding my true place.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, anger turned to ashes,   
when I learned to let it go,  
Found peace in deeper waters,   
where the wise and gentle flow,  
From the flame into the quiet,   
where my heart can find release,  
Transforming anger into wisdom,   
turning pain into peace.  
  
[Outro]  
So if you’re feeling angry,   
and don’t know what to do,  
Look deep into the shadows,   
find the light that’s shining through,  
For peace is always waiting,   
on the other side of fear,  
Transform your anger into wisdom,   
let the path be clear.  
  
[End]
