Levers help us lift and pry,  
Up and down, they make things fly.  
With a fulcrum, strong and true,  
Heavy loads, we can move too.  
Levers, levers, here and there,  
Helping hands, they’re everywhere.

Simple machines, let’s sing along,  
Levers, gears, and axles strong.  
Working hard to help us play,  
Simple machines, hooray, hooray!

Gears turn round with teeth so fine,  
They work together, every time.  
Big and small, they mesh just right,  
Gears make things move day and night.  
Gears, gears, turning round,  
Helping things go up and down.

Axles join the wheels to go,  
Round and round, they help them roll.  
In our cars and in our toys,  
Axles bring us so much joy.  
Axles, axles, strong and neat,  
Making wheels roll down the street.
