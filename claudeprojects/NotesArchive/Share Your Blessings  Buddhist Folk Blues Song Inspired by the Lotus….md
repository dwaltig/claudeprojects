Lyrics:   
(Verse 1)  
Woke up this mornin', Lotus Sutra in my hand,  
Read 'bout a Bodhisattva, across the dusty land.  
Endless-Intent, they called him, heart full of the light,  
Offered up a necklace, shinin' ever so bright.  
  
(Verse 2)  
Gems of finest water, a treasure to behold,  
Offered to World-Voice-Perceiver, a story to be told.  
But that compassionate being, with wisdom in their eyes,  
Said, "No, I cannot take it," beneath the temple skies.  
  
(Verse 3)  
Buddha watched this happenin', with a gentle, knowing smile,  
Said, "Receive it, World-Voice, stay with it for a while.  
For the sake of Endless-Intent, and all who seek the way,  
And every livin' creature, from this very day."  
  
(Verse 4)  
Gods and mighty dragons, spirits in the air,  
Yakshas and Gandharvas, all burdened by their care.  
Asuras and Garudas, Kinnaras so sweet,  
Mahoragas crawlin', on weary, dusty feet.  
  
(Verse 5)  
Humans and non-humans, every single soul,  
Need a little kindness, to make their spirits whole.  
So World-Voice then accepted, with compassion deep inside,  
Divided up the treasure, with nothin' left to hide.  
  
(Verse 6)  
One part to the Buddha, the source of all we know,  
The other to the stupa, where the precious teachings grow.  
Reminds us when we're blessed, with fortune or with grace,  
It ain't for keepin' selfish, gotta share it with the race.  
  
(Outro)  
Yeah, gotta share your blessings, let your merit shine,  
Like that necklace in the story, makin' everything fine.  
Lotus Sutra whisperin', a lesson plain and true,  
What you got, you gotta give, for me and for you too.
