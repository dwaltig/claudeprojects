The writing of Nichiren Daishonin offer a multifaceted understanding of how we can engage with the Lotus Sutra, and the benefits that each level of engagement brings. While the simple act of chanting its title, Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, is consistently upheld as a potent practice in itself, the sources also illuminate the value of delving into the sutra's words and living its teachings.  
Some texts, like the "Sūtra of Immeasurable Meaning," stress the sutra's transformative power, suggesting that those who embrace it fully—accepting, upholding, reading, and reciting it—gain the ability to effectively share the Dharma and guide others toward enlightenment. This implies that a deeper comprehension of the sutra, achieved through study, empowers practitioners to better embody and transmit its wisdom. The idea is further echoed in the notion that the sutra's influence extends beyond personal growth to encompass the spiritual awakening of those guided by dedicated practitioners.  
Similarly, "The Great Teachings of The Lotus of the True Law" emphasizes the profound merit not only in hearing the sutra but also in reading, preaching, and disseminating its message, indicating that active engagement with its content and sharing its wisdom lead to greater spiritual rewards. The text underscores the importance of understanding and interpreting the sutra's teachings.  
"The Lotus Sutra by H Kerns" proposes a hierarchy of engagement, suggesting that hearing the sutra directly from a teacher surpasses merely hearing it in "regular tradition." This hints that direct interaction with a teacher who can explain and contextualize the sutra's teachings may facilitate deeper understanding and greater benefits.  
Other excerpts highlight the rewards of actively applying the sutra's teachings, emphasizing that the sutra is not just for study but for internalization and practice. "Keeping this Sutra," the text suggests, involves embodying and living in accordance with its wisdom.  
"WND Part 1a" presents a broader view of Buddhist practices, acknowledging various paths and suggesting that all can bring benefits, aligning with the idea that even chanting the Lotus Sutra's title holds significant power. "WND Part 1b" stresses the importance of aligning one's actions with the sutra's teachings, suggesting that reciting the sutra perfectly is less important than embodying its message through action.  
"WND Part 2c" suggests that the depth of understanding while chanting doesn't diminish its benefits, reinforcing the idea that chanting the title itself holds immense power. In "WND Part 3," the significance of the Lotus Sutra's message is emphasized, suggesting that understanding and practicing its teachings leads to a deeper realization.  
In sum, the sources suggest that while chanting the title of the Lotus Sutra is a powerful practice with profound benefits, a deeper understanding of the sutra's teachings, gained through study and reflection, can enrich one's practice and empower them to better embody and share its transformative wisdom. They encourage a multifaceted approach that combines chanting with study and the application of the sutra's teachings in daily life.
