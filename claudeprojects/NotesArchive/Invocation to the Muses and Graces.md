# Invocation to the Muses and Graces  
## *for those seeking light, love, and lasting creation*  
  
O Graces who glide through the golden air, Who dress the dawn in kindness and care, Let your laughter fall like rain, On the souls who stumble through sorrow and strain.  
  
O Muses, breath of the unseen flame, Who whisper truth without seeking fame, Sing through the silence, move through the hand, Lift each voice to understand.  
  
Let Hephaestus strike with gentle might, Forging beauty from grief and night. Let friendships rise where fear once stood, Let genius bloom for the greater good.  
  
May all who hunger find their song, And know the place where they belong. With open hearts and steady grace, May all beings find their sacred place.
