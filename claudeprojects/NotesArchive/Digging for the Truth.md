[Intro]  
[Verse 1]  
  
In a land so dry and barren, under a scorching sun,  
I took up the shovel, my journey had begun.  
Searching for the water, the life beneath the sand,  
With each dig, I delved deeper, with every trembling hand.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, I'm digging for the truth, deep within my soul,  
Tapping into wisdom, making myself whole.  
Through the mud and mire, I see the signs so clear,  
The water of awakening, I know it's drawing near.  
  
  
[Verse 2]  
At first, the sand was white and dry, no water to be found,  
But I kept on with my digging, I didn't turn around.  
Then came the muddy trickles, the promise of the spring,  
I felt the drops of wisdom, heard the inner voice sing.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, I'm digging for the truth, deep within my soul,  
Tapping into wisdom, making myself whole.  
Through the mud and mire, I see the signs so clear,  
The water of awakening, I know it's drawing near.  
  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[Bridge]  
Every challenge, every doubt, splashes of the fight,  
But I see the water rising, coming into sight.  
With every teaching embraced, every lesson learned,  
The well of truth within me, finally discerned.  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, I'm digging for the truth, deep within my soul,  
Tapping into wisdom, making myself whole.  
Through the mud and mire, I see the signs so clear,  
The water of awakening, I know it's drawing near.  
  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[Outro]  
In the depths of my soul, the well of truth does spring,  
In the heart of my being, hear the enlightenment ring.  
With compassion as my guide, on this sacred way,  
I've found the living water, in my heart to stay.  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
[reprise-Bridge]  
Every challenge, every doubt, splashes of the fight,  
But I see the water rising, coming into sight.  
With every teaching embraced, every lesson learned,  
The well of truth within me, finally discerned.
