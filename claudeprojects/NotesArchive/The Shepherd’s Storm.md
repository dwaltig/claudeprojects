Lyrics:  
(Verse 1)   
The shepherd boy upon the hill,   
his flock beneath the sky,   
Felt the wind rise,   
a chilling thrill,   
as storm clouds drew nigh.   
He sought the oak,   
its branches strong,   
a shelter from the rain,   
But nature's fury,   
wild and long,   
would rend the earth in pain.  
  
(Chorus)   
Oh, the storm it raged,   
the lightning flashed,   
the mighty oak did fall,   
The sheep they scattered,   
fear surpassed,   
the shepherd lost his all.   
But through the dark,   
a guiding light,   
a beacon in the storm,   
Led him to safety through the night,   
a haven,   
safe and warm.  
  
(Verse 2)   
A humble cave,   
a fire's glow,   
a refuge from the wind,   
The shepherd found,   
his heart aglow,   
a solace for his kin.   
No towering tree,   
no earthly might,   
could offer such reprieve,   
But faith's small flame,   
in darkest night,   
brought comfort to believe.  
  
(Chorus)   
Oh, the storm it raged,   
the lightning flashed,   
the mighty oak did fall,   
The sheep they scattered,   
fear surpassed,   
the shepherd lost his all.   
But through the dark,   
a guiding light,   
a beacon in the storm,   
Led him to safety through the night,   
a haven,   
safe and warm.  
  
(Bridge)   
The shepherd learned a lesson deep,   
that strength is not in sight,   
But in the faith that we do keep,   
a beacon burning bright.   
Though storms may rage and trees may fall,   
and fear may fill the air,   
A higher power answers all,   
and guides us with its care.  
  
(Chorus)   
Oh, the storm it raged,   
the lightning flashed,   
the mighty oak did fall,   
The sheep they scattered,   
fear surpassed,   
the shepherd lost his all.   
But through the dark,   
a guiding light,   
a beacon in the storm,  
Led him to safety through the night,   
a haven,   
safe and warm.  
  
(Outro)   
So trust the flame,   
though small it seems,   
and let your faith take hold,   
For in its light,   
our hope redeems,   
and stories yet unfold.
