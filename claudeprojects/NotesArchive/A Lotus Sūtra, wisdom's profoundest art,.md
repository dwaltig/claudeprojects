  
A **Lotus Sūtra**, wisdom's profoundest art,   
A radical re-vision, touching every heart.   
In Chapter Nineteen, to Constant-Endeavor spoke,   
Of benefits immense, a truth that softly woke.  
  
**To see the reality of all things**, clear and deep,   
Beyond deluded views, while suffering's shadows sleep.   
The Mystic Law revealed, the universe within,   
Compassion, courage, wisdom, where truth does begin.  
  
With senses purified, a grand, awakened sight:   
**Eight hundred eyes** discern three thousand worlds of light,   
Karmic causes, states of being, from hell to highest sphere.   
**Twelve hundred ears** hear every sound, dispelling doubt and fear.   
  
**Eight hundred nose** benefits, fragrances from afar,   
Discerning spiritual presence, a guiding, fragrant star.   
**Twelve hundred tongue** benefits, a voice both deep and true,   
Expounding the correct Law, delighting all anew.   
  
**Eight hundred body** benefits, like lapis lazuli pure,   
Reflecting all existence, forever to endure.   
**Twelve hundred mind** benefits, mastering truth's great store,   
Buddha's Law expressed, forevermore.  
  
For **Ten Worlds reside within**, not fixed but mutually possessed,   
From rage of Hell to Buddhahood's blessed rest.   
A consciousness transformed, activating innate light.  
Then, **expound as they understand it**, genuine and bright,   
Not for the few, but all, with their own inner might.   
This is **Upaya**, skillful means, a nuanced, guiding art,   
To reach all diverse beings, giving each their part.  
Like **parable of burning house**, the father's wise design,   
Or **rain on medicinal herbs**, where all beings align.   
Your **limited capacity**, no barrier at all,   
But a unique, true voice, answering Dharma's call.   
For the goal is liberation, transformation's gentle thrall.  
The Sūtra itself, a **living Dharma** grand,   
**Each word the Buddha's embodiment**, in every land.   
In medieval Japan, by transcription, truth arose,   
The **Odaimoku**, "**Nam-myoho-renge-kyo**," the essence now bestows.   
**Nichiren's** wisdom, for the Latter Day of Law,   
The **Gohonzon**, a focus, drawing Buddhahood in awe.   
The **Kaidan**, any place, where Odaimoku is sung,   
A universal platform, by all for all now strung.  
**Bodily reading** the Sūtra, in actions, thoughts, and deeds,   
**One contains all**, planting enlightenment's true seeds.   
Applicable **"here and now"**, in turmoil's very breath.  
In **Mappō's age**, a time of deep decline,   
When old ways faltered, a new path must shine.   
Nichiren's conviction, the Lotus Sūtra's truth,   
The **Three Great Hidden Dharmas**, for every soul, for youth.  
No despair, but **human revolution**'s mighty call,   
A **vow for kosen-rufu**, to stand for one and all.   
**Earthly desires, enlightenment**'s transformative art,   
**Sufferings of birth and death, Nirvana**'s very heart.   
Converting poison, into medicine, anew,   
Through **faith and compliance**, with purpose strong and true.  
So uphold and expound, with purpose clear and bold,   
A transformative path, for stories to unfold.   
For **Buddhahood's inherent**, a light within us all,   
A path to universal peace, answering freedom's call.
