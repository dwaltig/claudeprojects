# Let Go  
  
[Verse 1]  
[Verse 1]  
In shadows of doubt,   
where dreams fade away,  
We hide our true colors,   
in shades of gray.  
Fear keeps us chained,   
our voices subdued,  
But deep in our hearts,   
a song waits to bloom.  
  
[Chorus]  
Let go, let go,   
let your spirit fly,  
With our Guiding Light by our side,   
With our Guiding Light by our side,   
With our Guiding Light by our side,   
With our Guiding Light by our side,   
With our Guiding Light by our side,   
With our Guiding Light by our side,   
With our Guiding Light by our side,   
With our Guiding Light by our side,   
With our Guiding Light by our side,   
reach for the sky.  
Unveil the talent,   
hidden deep inside,  
When you let go,   
true art will arise.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Embrace the unknown,   
where magic resides,  
Break free from the past,   
let your soul be your guide.  
In the dance of creation,   
find your own beat,  
With every step forward,   
feel the earth beneath your feet.   
feel the earth beneath your feet.   
feel the earth beneath your feet.   
(Let go, let go, let go)  
(Let go, let go, let go)  
(Let go, let go, let go)  
(Let go, let go, let go)  
(Let go, let go, let go)  
(Let go, let go, let go)  
(Let go, let go, let go)  
(Let go, let go, let go)  
(Let go, let go, let go)  
(Let go, let go, let go)  
(Let go, let go, let go)

In the flow of the moment,   
joy takes the lead,  
In the tapestry of life,   
find the thread you need.  
With each note and rhythm,   
a story unfolds,  
In the act of letting go,   
our true selves we hold.  
  
[Chorus]  
Let go, let go,   
let your spirit fly,  
With the Muse by our side,   
reach for the sky.  
Unveil the talent,   
hidden deep inside,  
When you let go,   
true art will arise.  
true art will arise.

Now sing your own song,   
with passion and grace,  
In the symphony of life,   
find your own place.  
With the Muse's blessing,   
let your heart show,  
In the beauty of letting go,   
let your talent grow.  
let your talent grow.

With melodies born   
from dreams so deep,  
We honor the call

Dancing with passion   
in the moon’s soft light.

To the Bacchanal

where spirits cheer,  
We'll sing our songs   
with hearts so free,  
In the timeless   
dance of creativity.
