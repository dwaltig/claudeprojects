# Broken Road, Quiet Fire  
  
**Broken Road, Quiet Fire**  
A bluesy folk meditation on resilience, connection, and the quiet strength that lives inside us all.  
  
From the opening lines—*“walkin’ down a broken road, chasin’ fading shadows”*—the song travels from loneliness and doubt into a hard-won discovery: the true map is the heart itself. The chorus burns steady:  
  
*“The fire’s in your footsteps, the compass in your soul,*  
*The way you heal a broken world is what can make you whole.”*  
  
Finger-picked guitar and a slow-rolling groove carry lyrics that weave personal awakening with collective care. Verse by verse, it reminds us that every stranger’s breath is part of the same tapestry, that shared burdens become answered prayers, and that even sorrow and storms feed the garden of renewal.  
  
For listeners who love modern folk-blues with a spiritual pulse, this track offers both a quiet prayer and a rallying cry: keep walking, keep giving, and let the love inside you sing its quiet, unstoppable song.  
  
Lyrics:   
Verse 1  
I was walkin’ down a broken road, with nothing left to find,  
Chasin’ fading shadows, a riddle for my mind.  
I begged the sky for answers, a sign to light the way,  
But the only sun I needed was buried in the gray.  
Then a quiet thunder trembled, deep beneath my skin,  
And I found the map I wanted where the heart begins.  
  
Chorus  
Oh, the fire’s in your footsteps, the compass in your soul,  
The way you heal a broken world is what can make you whole.  
The love you give so freely is a river running strong—  
That truth already lives in you and sings its quiet song.  
  
Verse 2  
The threads of every stranger are woven into mine,  
One vast, breathing tapestry no soul can walk outside.  
Your heavy stone’s my mountain, your tired sigh my own,  
Seeds of grace keep sprouting when we share a single throne.  
And the truest kind of freedom is a weight we choose to bear,  
A strength that grows between us—like a silent answered prayer.  
  
Chorus  
Oh, the fire’s in your footsteps, the compass in your soul,  
The way you heal a broken world is what can make you whole.  
The love you give so freely is a river running strong—  
That truth already lives in you and sings its quiet song.  
  
Bridge  
Don’t turn your back on sorrow, don’t run from all the pain;  
It’s the steady, patient thunder that brings the cleansing rain.  
You’ll see a garden rising in the soil you used to fear,  
And every trial you walk through becomes a masterpiece held dear.  
  
Chorus (repeat / build)  
Oh, the fire’s in your footsteps, the compass in your soul,  
The way you heal a broken world is what can make you whole.  
The love you give so freely is a river running strong—  
That truth already lives in you and sings its quiet song.  
  
Outro  
So walk toward that horizon, with the light that shines within;  
Let your soul’s true nature be the place where peace begins.  
Make it your devotion—love that never gives in.
