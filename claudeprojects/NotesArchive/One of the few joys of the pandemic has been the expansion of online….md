One of the few "joys" of the pandemic has been the expansion of online services. Which one I recommend depends on what you want. For example, if you want to study about Buddhism and the foundations of Nichiren's teachings, then there is Ryuei McCormicks Nichiren Buddhist Sangha of the Bay Area -- https://www.nichirenbayarea.org/   If you prefer the rituals of Nichiren Buddhism and incorporation of the protective deities in your practice, then Shoda Kanai in Las Vegas is the place to go. https://www.kannon-temple-nevada.org/
