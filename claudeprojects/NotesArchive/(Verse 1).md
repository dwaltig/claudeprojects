(Verse 1)  
In days of old, this weary heart beheld a world of pain,  
I chased my dreams, watched them depart, then chased them all again.  
No lasting peace, no rest that stayed—just shadows and regret,  
A broken song that slowly frayed, a debt I can’t forget.  
  
(Chorus)  
But now a new song’s rising up, a truth begins to shine,  
An ancient tale fills up my cup with something so divine.  
My spirit’s learning how to fly on compassion’s light,  
A Pure Land growing deep inside—my darkness turns to bright.  
  
(Verse 2)  
The old ways spoke of start and end, of coming and of gone,  
But now I see what truth transcends the road I’m walking on.  
Through Buddha’s eyes, each breath I take ain’t bound by time or name,  
The veil lifts up, my soul’s awake—I’ll never be the same.  
  
(Verse 3)  
This world ain’t real, but ain’t fake neither—just depends on how I see,  
The chains that held my heart and spirit finally setting free.  
It’s not some place I’ve got to find, it’s right here in my chest,  
A Pure Land of the peaceful mind where weary souls find rest.  
  
(Chorus)  
Yeah, now a new song’s rising up, a truth begins to shine,  
An ancient tale fills up my cup with something so divine.  
My spirit’s learning how to fly on compassion’s light,  
A Pure Land growing deep inside—my darkness turns to bright.  
  
(Bridge)  
This wisdom brings a change of heart, a healing from within,  
Where once I felt so lost apart, now peace can enter in.  
Don’t need to run to distant shores or chase some promised land,  
The truth I sought was always yours, Lord—right here in my hand.  
  
(Outro)  
Yeah, a Pure Land of compassion, shining true and bright.  
  
The main changes I made:  
  
- Simplified language and made it more conversational/bluesy  
- Improved rhythm and meter for singing  
- Streamlined some overly complex phrases  
- Made the religious/spiritual elements flow more naturally  
- Added some blues/folk language (“ain’t,” “Lord,” etc.)  
- Tightened the structure and removed repetitive elements​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
