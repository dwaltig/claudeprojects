**[Verse 1]**  
In the land of gods and mortal ties,  
Eros saw her with his own eyes.  
Sent to bring her pain and strife,  
But he found his love, he found his wife.  
  
**[Chorus]**  
Oh, love that shines, it’s brighter than the stars,  
Breakin’ down the walls, and mendin’ all the scars.  
Through trials and the night, we hold on tight,  
Oh, love that shines, it’ll guide our fight.  
  
**[Verse 2]**  
Psyche walked through trials, through fire and rain,  
Her soul stayed strong through the deepest pain.  
A jealous heart tried to tear them apart,  
But love held true, straight from the start.  
  
**[Chorus]**  
Oh, love that shines, it’s brighter than the stars,  
Breakin’ down the walls, and mendin’ all the scars.  
Through trials and the night, we hold on tight,  
Oh, love that shines, it’ll guide our fight.  
  
**[Bridge]**  
The heavens opened, the gods gave a sign,  
Made her immortal, their love divine.  
Through every valley, through every storm,  
Their souls united, a love reborn.  
  
**[Chorus]**  
Oh, love that shines, it’s brighter than the stars,  
Breakin’ down the walls, and mendin’ all the scars.  
Through trials and the night, we hold on tight,  
Oh, love that shines, it’ll guide our fight.  
  
**[Outro]**  
In the heavens now, their love shines bright,  
Eros and Psyche, eternal light.  
Through every song, through every prayer,  
Their love reminds us, God is there.
