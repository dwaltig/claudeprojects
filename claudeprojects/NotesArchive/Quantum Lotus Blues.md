# Quantum Lotus Blues  
  
***(Slow 12-bar folk-blues; key of D minor with a lift to F major for the chorus)***  
  
**[Verse 1 – Waves of the Ancient One]**  
  
**In the hush before a heartbeat,**  
**worlds are born and fade away.**  
**A thousand kalpas in an instant,**  
**every night is yesterday.**  
**The Buddha smiles like a hidden spark,**  
**no start, no end, just play.**  
  
**[Chorus – Collapse of Wonder]**  
  
**Ooh, quantum lotus,**  
**blossom in the void so wide.**  
**Every petal holds a universe,**  
**every quark a boundless tide.**  
**Measure if you dare, friend,**  
**and watch all worlds collide.**  
  
**[Verse 2 – Indra’s Net Electric]**  
  
**Stars are strung like silver beads,**  
**mirrors in a cosmic thread.**  
**Touch one, all the others ring,**  
**entangled, alive, not dead.**  
**The Dharma’s net is shimmering light,**  
**where no single step can tread.**  
  
**[Chorus – Collapse of Wonder]**  
  
**Ooh, quantum lotus,**  
**blossom in the void so wide.**  
**Every petal holds a universe,**  
**every quark a boundless tide.**  
**Measure if you dare, friend,**  
**and watch all worlds collide.**  
  
**[Bridge – The Eternal Now]**  
  
**No clock can catch this presence,**  
**no map can mark the way.**  
**The Buddha’s voice is a wave-form,**  
**collapsing when we pray.**  
**Every choice a branching path,**  
**every breath a Big Bang day.**  
  
**[Final Chorus – All in One]**  
  
**Ooh, quantum lotus,**  
**bloom through every mind and star.**  
**Here and gone in the same sweet note,**  
**right where we already are.**  
**Sing it loud, the Dharma rides**  
**each quantum avatar.**  
  
***(Tag out with choir humming a minor-to-major drone as slide guitar bends upward like starlight.)***

**Production Notes (Suno-ready)**  
**	•	Tempo & Feel: 72 BPM, swampy slow-burn blues with a cosmic folk shimmer.**  
**	•	Key: D minor verses, lift to F major chorus for that “sudden vastness” feel.**  
**	•	Instrumentation: finger-picked acoustic guitar, warm upright bass, brushed snare; add a subtle synth pad with airy overtones to hint at quantum strangeness.**  
**	•	Vocals: Call-and-response between soloist and choir—solo carries the verses, choir swells on the choruses with long open vowels (“oooh… quantum lotus”).**  
**	•	Texture: occasional slide-guitar glissandos and a low, distant harmonium drone to suggest deep space.**
