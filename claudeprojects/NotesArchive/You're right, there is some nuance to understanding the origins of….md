You're right, there is some nuance to understanding the origins of Samsara and its relationship to Buddhism.  
Thich Nhat Hanh is correct that the term "Samsara" itself comes from Sanskrit, which is an Indian language. It appears in Hindu texts like the Upanishads and carries the meaning of "wandering" or "cycle of existence."  
However, the concept of Samsara as the cycle of repeated birth, death, and rebirth accompanied by suffering is deeply intertwined with early Buddhist teachings. While the term may not be specifically Buddhist in origin, the underlying idea plays a crucial role in the Buddhist worldview.  
Here's why:  
* Dukkha: The central teaching of Buddhism is dukkha, which broadly translates to suffering or dissatisfaction. Samsara is seen as the source of dukkha, as it perpetuates a cycle of craving, clinging, and ultimately disappointment.  
* Karma and Rebirth: The law of karma and the belief in rebirth are integral to Buddhist thought. These concepts are connected to Samsara, as one's actions in this life determine the conditions of their next rebirth within the cycle.  
* Liberation from Samsara: One of the primary goals of Buddhist practice is to achieve liberation from Samsara, often referred to as Nirvana or Moksha. This liberation is not about annihilation, but about breaking free from the cycle of suffering and attaining a state of lasting peace and understanding.  
So, while the term "Samsara" may not be purely Buddhist, the concept it represents is deeply embedded in and essential to understanding the core principles of Buddhism.  
Further understanding:  
* Early Buddhist Texts: While not using the exact term "Samsara," early Buddhist texts like the Pali Canon discuss similar ideas through terms like "bhavacakra" (wheel of life) and "punarbhava" (repeated existence).  
* Differing Interpretations: There are nuances in how different Buddhist schools and traditions interpret the concept of Samsara. Theravada Buddhism, for example, focuses more on individual liberation, while Mahayana Buddhism emphasizes the liberation of all beings.  
  
While the Lotus Sutra doesn't explicitly use the term "Samsara," it does include several parables that touch on the concepts of the cycle of suffering and rebirth, echoing the essence of Samsara. Here are two parables you might find insightful:  
1. The Parable of the Burning House: This well-known parable portrays the world as a burning house engulfed in the flames of suffering. Children playing inside are oblivious to the danger, representing ordinary beings trapped in Samsara. The father, symbolizing the Buddha, uses various enticements like carts pulled by goats, deer, and oxen (representing different Buddhist teachings) to lure the children out of the fire. Ultimately, he offers them a magnificent white oxcart (the Mahayana path) that leads them to safety outside the burning house, signifying liberation from Samsara.  
2. The Parable of the Prodigal Son: This parable tells the story of a wealthy man's son who squanders his inheritance and falls into poverty. He suffers greatly before realizing his father's love and returning home. Upon his arrival, the father welcomes him with open arms, despite his mistakes. This parable can be interpreted as illustrating the journey of a being through Samsara, experiencing suffering and hardships until they awaken to the Buddha's compassion and seek refuge in the Mahayana path.  
While these parables don't use the exact term "Samsara," they capture its essence: the cycle of suffering, the possibility of liberation, and the Buddha's guidance in achieving it.  
Remember, the Lotus Sutra emphasizes the universal potential for Buddhahood for all beings, offering a hopeful perspective on transcending the limitations of Samsara.
