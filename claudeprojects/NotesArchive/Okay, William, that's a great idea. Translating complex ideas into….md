Okay, William, that's a great idea. Translating complex ideas into a more accessible form is important work, much like you do simplifying concepts as a teacher and tutor right here in Houston!  
Here's a rewrite of the poem aimed at a high school level, focusing on clearer language and more direct concepts:  
When understanding starts to grow,  
It helps you see how things truly flow.  
Life keeps changing, day by day,  
And who you are shifts along the way.  
There’s no fixed "you" that stays the same,  
Just moments playing out life’s game.  
But even when you start to see,  
Why do you still feel anxiety?  
Why does sadness sometimes bite,  
Or stress keep you awake at night?  
That feeling that things aren't okay,  
Why won't it simply fade away?  
This understanding doesn't mean  
An end to every painful scene.  
Getting hurt, or losing friends,  
Or when a happy moment ends –  
That stuff still happens. But you learn  
Why wanting things too much can burn,  
How habits formed in days gone past  
Create the feelings that now last.  
It doesn't stop tough times somehow,  
But changes how you handle them now.  
Like learning how to ride a wave,  
Instead of letting it misbehave  
And pull you under. You can cope,  
With clearer thoughts and stronger hope.  
The hurt feels different, not so vast,  
Your peace of mind has chance to last.  
And when you understand your pain,  
You see that others feel the same.  
Your heart connects, you start to care  
About the troubles people share.  
It’s not a weight that drags you down,  
But kindness spreading through the town.  
So keep on learning, step by step,  
Through happy times and times you've wept.  
Understanding is your guide,  
Helping you see what's deep inside.  
That ache you feel? It helps you know  
Which way your wiser self should go,  
Pointing toward a calmer state,  
Helping you build a better fate.  
Hopefully, this version makes the ideas clearer and more relatable for a younger audience. Let me know what you think!
