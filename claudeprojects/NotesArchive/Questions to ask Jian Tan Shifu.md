Questions to ask Jian Tan Shifu:  
  
The school of the elders do not hold sacred the Mahayana Teachings. They consider their origin as suspicious. The School of the Elders have a clear origin for their teachings, and believe the Mahayana Teachings were fabricated. Can you explain the origin of the Mahayana Teachings?  
  
There is another school of Buddhism that teaches there are many more teachings yet to be discovered or written. Is this true?  
  
How can we know if a Buddhist teaching is authentic or not?  
  
What is the meaning of the word, "Dharma?"  
  
Is it true that, even though people may not understand the exact meaning of the text of the Lotus Sutra, if they accept and uphold the entire sutra, or just one phrase of the sutra; if they themselves read the sutra or copy it, or if they get others to read or copy it; or, if they neither read nor copy it, but just face the sutra, press their palms together and bow in obeisance, or make offerings of incense and flowers; or, if they do not do any of these things, but see others doing these things and have just a slight feeling of rejoicing in their hearts or are happy that the Lotus Sutra is being spread throughout the country—is it true that, if they carry out even one of these acts, they will not be held accountable for their worldly offenses, but will be aided by the benefits of the Lotus Sutra and, like the sages who have reached the first of the four stages of enlightenment in the Hinayana teachings, will in each of their future existences be reborn in the human or the heavenly realm, and will not fall into the evil paths of existence? And, is it true that, constantly reborn in the human or heavenly realms, they will eventually gain complete enlightenment into the Lotus Sutra, attain rebirth in one of the pure lands of the ten directions, or, should they remain in this present world, attain Buddhahood in their present form?   
  
Even though clergy and laity may not possess the slightest understanding of the Lotus Sutra, will they still receive any benefit from practicing it? The Daishonin answers yes, so long as they do not give way to slander or abandon faith in the Lotus Sutra; if only they continue to practice, he says, they will not fall into the evil paths of existence.
