Lyrics:   
[Verse 1]  
Golden streets and diamond skies,  
In your dreams, the angels fly.  
But every shimmer tears apart,  
Your perfect bliss breaks my broken heart.  
  
[Verse 2]  
You see the gold, I see the grave,  
You’re living free, I’m love’s slave.  
Your laughter rings, it’s my despair,  
Your heaven’s light is my cross to bear.  
  
[Chorus]  
One man’s heaven is another man’s hell,  
Where love’s sweet song becomes a tolling bell.  
Your paradise, where angels dwell,  
Is my fiery ring, a cursed spell.  
  
[Verse 3]  
Red roses bloom in your embrace,  
But in my hands, they lose their grace.  
Your starry nights, my endless rain,  
Your joy's my sorrow, your love's my pain.  
  
[Bridge]  
You’re climbing high, I’m sinking low,  
Your rising sun’s my shadowed glow.  
The angels sing your sacred tune,  
But I hear thunder, the howl of ruin.  
  
[Chorus]  
One man’s heaven is another man’s hell,  
Where love’s sweet song becomes a tolling bell.  
Your paradise, where angels dwell,  
Is my fiery ring, a cursed spell.  
  
[Outro]  
So dance on streets of gold tonight,  
While I drown in my fading light.  
Your heaven’s glow, my heart’s farewell,  
One man’s heaven is a tortured shell.
