(Verse 1)  
Used to chase the paper, the bling, the fleeting fame  
Now I'm seekin' truth, whisperin' the Buddha's name  
Twelve hundred qualities, intellect so refined  
Openin' up my heart, expandin' my mind  
Single verse resonate, meanings unfold  
Stories of compassion, centuries old  
  
(Chorus)  
Lotus flower bloom, wisdom in my soul  
Dharma's in my veins, takin' control  
From Houston to the world, spreadin' the light  
Padmaprabha's here, shinin' so bright  
No more shallow rhymes, just deep understanding  
Universal truth, forever expanding  
Ancient wisdom, modern day flow  
Plant the seeds of peace, watch 'em grow  
  
(Verse 2)  
Used to be blind, caught in the rat race  
Now I see the connections, every time and space  
Six realms of being, from gods to the beast  
Understandin' their struggles, findin' inner peace  
Not just words I'm spittin', it's a way of life  
Cuttin' through the illusions, the pain, and the strife  
Everyday sayings, mixed with sacred law  
Elevatin' consciousness, breakin' down every flaw  
  
(Chorus)  
Lotus flower bloom, wisdom in my soul  
Dharma's in my veins, takin' control  
From Houston to the world, spreadin' the light  
Padmaprabha's here, shinin' so bright  
No more shallow rhymes, just deep understanding  
Universal truth, forever expanding  
Ancient wisdom, modern day flow  
Plant the seeds of peace, watch 'em grow  
  
(Bridge)  
Not yet an Arya, but I'm on the path  
Studyin' the scriptures, avoidin' Buddha's wrath  
Reflectin' on the teachings, day and night  
Sharpening my mind, makin' my spirit bright  
Like the ancient masters, preachin' with grace  
Sharing the Dharma, in every time and place  
  
(Verse 3)  
Connections and knots, I unravel with ease  
Contradictions in life, bring me no unease  
Interpretations flow, like a gentle breeze  
Ancient Sutras' wisdom, sets my spirit free  
From the streaming platforms to the written page  
Sharing my gifts, across every stage  
Eight books published, thousands of songs  
My voice resonates, where it belongs  
  
(Chorus)  
Lotus flower bloom, wisdom in my soul  
Dharma's in my veins, takin' control  
From Houston to the world, spreadin' the light  
Padmaprabha's here, shinin' so bright  
No more shallow rhymes, just deep understanding  
Universal truth, forever expanding  
Ancient wisdom, modern day flow  
Plant the seeds of peace, watch 'em grow  
  
(Outro)  
Yeah, Padmaprabha, Lotus Light, that's my name  
Spreading love and wisdom, ain't nothin' the same  
From the depths of the Sutra, to the hip-hop beat  
Dropping truth bombs, for every soul to meet. Word.  
  
(Reprise Outro)  
Yeah, Padmaprabha, Lotus Light, that's my name  
Spreading love and wisdom, ain't nothin' the same  
From the depths of the Sutra, to the hip-hop beat  
Dropping truth bombs, for every soul to meet.   
Word.
