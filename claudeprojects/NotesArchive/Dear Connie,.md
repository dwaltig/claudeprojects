I understand the apprehension about the cost and effectiveness of certain measures like patrols and surveillance cameras. It's clear that we need to find a balance between enhancing our future and being mindful of costs and privacy concerns.

Regarding the patrols, perhaps we could explore cost-effective alternatives, such as a neighborhood watch program where residents volunteer to keep an eye out for suspicious activities. This approach can foster a sense of community involvement and vigilance without the high costs associated with professional services.

For surveillance cameras, we could consider placing them only at key entry and exit points, minimizing privacy concerns while still deterring potential criminal activities. We can also look into affordable and efficient ways to monitor the footage, possibly through a volunteer system or a rotating schedule among residents.

Regarding visitor logs, we could implement a simple, non-intrusive system, perhaps a digital log that can be managed by the residents or a designated committee, ensuring that it’s maintained with minimal intrusion.

I acknowledge your concerns about the additional lighting and its impact on the electricity costs. We can explore energy-efficient lighting solutions that provide adequate illumination without significantly increasing costs.  
Regarding the holiday decorations in common areas, I share your concerns about safety and adherence to community rules. We should remind residents to be mindful of where they place their decorations, ensuring they do not obstruct lawn care work or pose safety hazards. Perhaps a community notice or meeting could be arranged to discuss this matter and agree on acceptable practices.

Lastly, addressing the issue of parking and rule adherence in our community is vital. We might consider reinforcing the rules through community meetings and notices, and discussing the possibility of more effective enforcement measures to ensure compliance.

Your point about residents being vigilant, especially during the holidays, is well-taken. Encouraging responsible behavior, like not leaving valuables in cars and being mindful of package deliveries, is a practical and immediate step we can all take.
