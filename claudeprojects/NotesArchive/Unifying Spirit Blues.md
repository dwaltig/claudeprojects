# Unifying Spirit Blues  
*(A Blues song inspired by Nichiren’s "Itai Doshin" and the Battle of Muye)]*  
  
**[Verse 1 – The Disunity Blues]** Seven hundred thousand souls, Many bodies, different minds, A mighty force all torn apart, Lost in fractured lines. King Zhou’s army crumbled slow, Fear and doubt held tight, No cause to rally ‘round, Just shadows in the night.  
  
**[Chorus]** Oh, we’re many in body, but lost in mind, Can’t find no way to leave the past behind. But if we stand together, hearts beating one, There’s nothing that we can’t overcome.  
  
**[Verse 2 – Inner Conflict]** Even one man’s two minds Can tear his soul apart, Cross purposes in his heart, A broken, bitter start. So many voices screaming loud, No harmony, no song, When unity is missing, Everything goes wrong.  
  
**[Chorus]** Oh, we’re many in body, but lost in mind, Can’t find no way to leave the past behind. But if we stand together, hearts beating one, There’s nothing that we can’t overcome.  
  
**[Bridge – The Hope of Itai Doshin]** Eight hundred strong and united true, Led by the wisdom of the few. Compassion’s flame, burning bright, Guiding through the darkest night.  
  
**[Verse 3 – The Power of Unity]** King Wu’s small but mighty band, One spirit hand in hand, With faith and courage as their guide, They turned the failing tide. Many bodies, one mind, one soul, That’s the way to win the fight, When hearts align with truth and love, We shine in darkest night.  
  
**[Final Chorus]** Yes, we’re many in body, but one in mind, Leave the past and pain behind. With compassion and wisdom, hand in hand, We rise as one across this land.  
  
**[Outro]** All things are possible, if we unite, Nothing’s gained in the fading light. So come on, brothers, sisters, friends, Let’s walk this path ‘til the very end.
