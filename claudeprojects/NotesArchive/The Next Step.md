# The Next Step  
  
This song, inspired by a quote from Brandon Sanderson, explores the power of taking the next step, no matter how small. It's a reminder that progress is a journey, not a destination, and that every step we take, every choice we make, shapes our future. With uplifting lyrics and a driving rhythm, "The Next Step" encourages listeners to embrace the unknown, overcome challenges, and keep moving forward towards their dreams.  
  
  
  
[Verse]  
It's not the first step we take  
It's the next one that's great  
Whether starting a new project  
Or just getting up late  
  
[Verse 2]  
Each move forwards the show  
Even when the pace is slow  
From the smallest cup of coffee  
To where dreams tend to go  
  
[Pre-Chorus]   
And though the path may twist and turn   
With every doubt and every fear   
A fire within us starts to burn   
The next step brings us near   
  
[Chorus]  
Step by step we rise and shine  
No matter what we leave behind  
Always moving forward  
Never blind  
The next step  
We'll always find  
  
[Verse 3]  
In the darkest hours of night  
In the daytime's blinding light  
Every step we choose to make  
Can guide us to what's right  
  
[Bridge]  
So don't worry if you stumble  
Take a breath  
Move past the humble  
Life’s a path we all must climb  
The next step’s worth the trouble  
  
[Verse 4]  
Feel the rhythm of your heart  
It's the next beat that makes a start  
Find your stride in every day  
And dance through every part  
  
[Pre-Chorus]   
And though the path may twist and turn   
With every doubt and every fear   
A fire within us starts to burn   
The next step brings us near   
  
[Chorus]  
Step by step we rise and shine  
No matter what we leave behind  
Always moving forward  
Never blind  
The next step  
We'll always find  
  
[End]
