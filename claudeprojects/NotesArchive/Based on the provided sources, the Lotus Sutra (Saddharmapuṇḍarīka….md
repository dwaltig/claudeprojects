Based on the provided sources, the *Lotus Sutra* (*Saddharmapuṇḍarīka Sūtra*) and the *Great Nirvana Sutra* (*Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*) share status as ultimate Mahayana teachings, yet they utilize different metaphors, doctrinal emphases, and narrative structures to convey their messages.  
**1. Core Doctrinal Focus**  
* **The Lotus Sutra (The One Vehicle):** The central teaching is the **One Buddha Vehicle** (*Ekayana*). The sutra reveals that the "three vehicles" (Sravaka, Pratyekabuddha, and Bodhisattva) are merely skillful means (*upaya*) used by the Buddha to guide beings of varying capacities to the single goal of Buddhahood. It emphasizes that all beings, including those previously thought incapable (like Arhats), will eventually become Buddhas.  
* **The Great Nirvana Sutra (Buddha Nature and Permanence):** The central teaching is the **Eternal Presence of the Buddha** and the universality of **Buddha Nature** (*Fo Xing*). It asserts that the Buddha is not impermanent but "Constant, Blissful, Self, and Pure" (*Chang, Le, Wo, Jing*). It explicitly defines the "Self" (Atman) as the Buddha Nature found within all beings, countering the provisional teaching of "non-self".  
**2. Metaphors and Parables**  
Both sutras rely heavily on parables, but they serve different theological points:  
* **Lotus Sutra Parables:** Focus on the method of teaching and the destiny of the disciples.  
    * **The Burning House:** The father lures children out of a burning house with promises of three types of carts (goat, deer, bullock) but gives them all the same magnificent great white bullock cart (the One Vehicle).  
    * **The Prodigal Son:** A wealthy father employs his lost son as a scavenger (representing Hinayana practice) to gradually build his confidence before revealing his true inheritance (Buddhahood).  
    * **The Medicinal Herbs:** One rain falls (the Dharma), but plants of different sizes (beings) absorb it according to their capacity, though the water is the same.  
    * **The Magic City:** A guide conjures a city to rest weary travelers (Nirvana for Arhats) before leading them to the true treasure land (Buddhahood).  
* **Nirvana Sutra Parables:** Focus on the hidden nature of reality and the refinement of teachings.  
    * **Milk to Ghee:** The sutra compares the progression of teachings to the refining of milk into cream, butter, and finally **ghee** (醍醐). The *Nirvana Sutra* is equated to the ghee, the most supreme taste.  
    * **The Hidden Treasure:** A poor woman has a treasure of gold in her house but does not know it until a skillful person shows her. This represents the Buddha Nature hidden within the "house" of the five skandhas (aggregates).  
    * **The Blind Men and the Elephant:** Blind men touch different parts of an elephant and describe it differently (a radish, a winnowing fan, etc.). This illustrates how partial truths fail to capture the totality of the Buddha Nature.  
    * **The Physician and the Sick Child:** The Buddha compares himself to a doctor who first prohibits milk (teaching non-self) to cure a specific illness, but later prescribes sweet milk (teaching the True Self) when the patient is ready.  
**3. Universal Salvation and Specific Figures**  
* **Lotus Sutra:**  
    * **Arhats:** It predicts Buddhahood for Śrāvakas like Sariputra and Kasyapa, who previously believed they had reached their final destination.  
    * **Women:** The Dragon King's daughter transforms into a man and instantly attains Buddhahood, demonstrating that women can attain enlightenment.  
    * **Evil Persons:** Devadatta, the Buddha's enemy, is predicted to become a Buddha named "Heavenly King," showing that even the wicked can eventually be saved.  
* **Nirvana Sutra:**  
    * **Icchantikas:** The text deals extensively with *Icchantikas* (those who have severed all roots of goodness). It asserts that even *Icchantikas* possess Buddha Nature and can eventually attain enlightenment, though they are the most difficult to cure.  
    * **Ajatashatru:** The sutra focuses on the redemption of King Ajatashatru, who killed his father. The Buddha delays his entry into Nirvana specifically to save this king from the immediate retribution of hell.  
**4. Precepts and Practice**  
* **Lotus Sutra:** Emphasizes the merit of **faith**, **rejoicing**, and **upholding the text** itself. Worshiping the sutra, reading, reciting, and copying it are presented as supreme acts of devotion that lead to Buddhahood.  
* **Nirvana Sutra:** Places a strong emphasis on **strict adherence to precepts** and **vegetarianism**.  
    * It explicitly prohibits eating meat, stating that meat-eating cuts off the seed of great compassion.  
    * It warns against monks who keep slaves, cattle, or engage in commerce.  
    * It teaches the "Four Reliances": Rely on the Dharma, not the person; on the meaning, not the words; on wisdom, not consciousness; and on definitive sutras (*nitartha*), not non-definitive sutras (*neyartha*).  
**5. View on Nirvana and the Buddha's Life**  
* **Lotus Sutra:** Reveals that the Buddha did not actually attain enlightenment for the first time under the Bodhi tree but attained it countless eons ago. His entry into Nirvana is a "skillful show" to cause beings to yearn for him, but he actually remains to teach.  
* **Nirvana Sutra:** Defines Nirvana not as extinction (like a lamp going out) but as a state of **Permanence, Bliss, Self, and Purity**. It argues that if Nirvana were mere extinction, it would be impermanent; therefore, true Nirvana must be eternal presence. It refutes the idea that the Buddha truly dies, comparing his "death" to a physician who leaves medicine for his children.
