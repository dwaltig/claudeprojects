Verse 1  
On a hill, there stood a tower, bathed in starry light,  
Where whispers spoke of crystal truth, clear as the endless night.  
A traveler came with a lantern bright, to seek the fabled gleam,  
But mirrors danced and shadows swayed—what's real, and what's a dream?  
  
Chorus  
Oh, the lantern guides, but the mirrors lie,  
And the crystal hides where the silence cries.  
Let the light fade low, let the mind grow still,  
And the truth will shine from the quiet hill.  
  
Verse 2  
The Keeper smiled and handed her the glow to light her way,  
“Take this flame to guide your steps, but know its truth will sway.  
For what you see is shaped by you, the mirrors and the flame,  
To glimpse the pure and boundless truth, first quiet what you claim.”  
  
Chorus  
Oh, the lantern guides, but the mirrors lie,  
And the crystal hides where the silence cries.  
Let the light fade low, let the mind grow still,  
And the truth will shine from the quiet hill.  
  
Bridge  
So she climbed the stairs and reached the heart,  
The crystal's glow seemed worlds apart.  
She cried, "This is not what I came to find,  
Just reflections bent by my restless mind!"  
  
Verse 3  
She stilled the flame, let darkness fall, and turned within her soul,  
The mirrors stopped their shadow dance, the crystal became whole.  
A universe within its depths, her lantern now at rest,  
The Keeper smiled, for she had found the truth beyond the quest.  
  
Chorus  
Oh, the lantern guides, but the mirrors lie,  
And the crystal hides where the silence cries.  
Let the light fade low, let the mind grow still,  
And the truth will shine from the quiet hill.  
  
Outro  
Now she walks with the quiet flame, her path is true and clear,  
A guiding voice for those who seek the truth that draws them near.  
For every heart holds a crystal bright, and every soul must climb,  
To find the hill, to still the light, and glimpse the truth divine.
