[Verse 1]  
Some Reiki  
Some karma  
Some things I shouldn't laugh about like being named Dharma  
So then what?  
It's nothing  
The trying brings the treasure but the truth comes with suffering  
  
[Chorus]  
It's nothing  
The trying brings the treasure but the truth comes with suffering  
Ooh-la-la  
Ooh-la-la  
  
[Verse 2]  
Somewhere free  
Some Beacon downs  
Some Dharma dogs will show you all the Eightfold Paths  
Some because it's below us  
Some say it's between us  
Some say it's within us  
Some Buddhists I don't trust  
Until then  
  
[Chorus]  
Karma comes  
Can sittin' bring the salvation 'cause let's see you tryin'?  
Ooh-la-la  
Ooh-la-la  
Ah  
Ooh-la-la  
Ooh-la-la  
Ah  
  
[Bridge]  
I can't prove  
I want stories  
Like dance and music  
And I can taste it and  
Weneedit  
And I can't sleep and I  
Everything I  
We already have  
And whatever it is  
We already have it  
Whatever it is  
Whenever it was  
We always had it  
Ahh ahh  
  
[Verse 3]  
Some Beyoncé  
Some hip-hop  
Some immigrants  
Some rock n' roll talk  
Some "Once upon a"  
Some stopped outside the Salinas Inn  
Some said taught  
Nothing could have prepared us  
Some said stopped  
Karma's gonna get ya  
It ain't the first time  
No  
It ain't the first choice  
No  
But here we are  
We, You, You and me  
Ah!  
  
[Chorus]  
It's nothing  
The tryin' brings the treasure but the truth comes with suffering  
Some say ah  
Ooh-la-la  
Ooh-la-la  
Some say it's nothing  
[Outro]  
Some nothin'  
Some Dharma  
Some nothin'  
Some say it's nothing
