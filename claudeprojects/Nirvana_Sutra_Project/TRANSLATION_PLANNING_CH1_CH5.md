## Recommendations

### Chapter 1:
**Suggested approach:** 10-12 sections
- Sections 1-7 are manageable (6-18 lines each)
- Section 8 (celestial beings) should be split into 3-4 subsections
- Section 9-10 are good length

**Key challenges:**
- Section 5 & 8 have extensive lists and elaborate imagery
- Will need careful attention to maintain Blues voice through repetitive lists

### Chapter 5:
**Suggested approach:** 10-12 sections
- Most sections are 6-15 lines (very manageable)
- Section 7 (30 analogies) should be split into 2-3 subsections
- Highly philosophical - will be challenging but rewarding for Blues translation

**Key challenges:**
- Abstract philosophical concepts (form/non-form, empty/not-empty)
- Rapid-fire analogies in Section 7
- Maintaining accessibility while preserving doctrinal precision

---

## Next Steps

**Recommendation:** Start with **Chapter 5** because:
1. More manageable length (220 vs. 301 lines)
2. Clearer section breaks
3. Builds on Chapter 2's doctrinal foundation
4. Philosophical depth will showcase the dual-agent methodology well

**Alternative:** Start with **Chapter 1** because:
1. Chronological order
2. Narrative-heavy (easier for Blues voice)
3. Sets the dramatic scene for the entire sutra
4. Establishes the assembly and context

**Your choice!** Both are excellent candidates for the next translation project.
