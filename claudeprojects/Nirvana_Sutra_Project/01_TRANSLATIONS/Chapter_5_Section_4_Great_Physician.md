### The Buddha's Teaching on "Great" Nirvāṇa (Line 67)

**佛告迦葉：「所言大者，其性廣博。猶如有人壽命無量，名大丈夫。是人若能安住正法，名人中勝。如我所說八大人覺，為一人有？為多人有？若一人具八，則為最勝。所言涅槃者，無諸瘡疣。善男子！譬如有人為毒箭所射，多受苦痛；值遇良醫，為拔毒箭，傅以妙藥，令其離苦，得受安樂。是醫即便遊於城邑及諸聚落，隨有患苦、瘡疣之處，即往其所，為療眾苦。善男子！如來亦爾，成等正覺，為大醫王，見閻浮提苦惱眾生，無量劫中被婬、怒、癡、煩惱毒箭，受大苦切。為如是等，說大乘經甘露法藥，療治此已，復至他方有諸煩惱毒箭之處，示現作佛，為其療治，是故名曰大般涅槃。大般涅槃者名解脫處，隨有調伏眾生之處，如來於中而作示現，以是真實甚深義故，名大涅槃。」**

**Literal translation:**

"The Buddha told Kāśyapa: 'What is called "great," its nature is vast and extensive. Like a person [whose] lifespan [is] immeasurable [is] called a great man. If this person is able to abide peacefully in the true Dharma, [he is] called supreme among people. Like my teaching [of] the eight great person's awakenings—does one person have [them], or do many people have [them]? If one person possesses all eight, then [he is] most supreme. What is called nirvāṇa [is] without all sores and warts. Good son! Like a person shot by a poisoned arrow, experiencing much suffering and pain, [who] encounters a good physician [who] extracts the poisoned arrow for [him], applies wonderful medicine, causes him to leave suffering, [and] able to receive peace and happiness. This physician immediately travels to cities and various villages. Wherever there are those suffering from illness [and] sores and warts, immediately goes to their place to heal the many sufferings. Good son! The Tathāgata is also thus. [Having] achieved perfect enlightenment, [he] became the Great Physician King. [He] sees Jambudvīpa suffering sentient beings [who] throughout immeasurable kalpas [have been] struck by lust, anger, delusion, affliction poison arrows, experiencing great acute suffering. For such [beings], [he] speaks Mahāyāna sūtras, ambrosia Dharma medicine. Having healed these, again goes to other directions where there are affliction poison arrows, manifests as a Buddha to heal them. Therefore [it is] called great parinirvāṇa. Great parinirvāṇa is called the place of liberation. Wherever there are sentient beings to be tamed, the Tathāgata in [that place] makes manifestation. Because of this true and profound meaning, [it is] called great nirvāṇa.'"

- 世尊 (shìzūn) - World-Honored One
- 世間醫師 (shìjiān yīshī) - worldly physicians
- 悉能療治 (xī néng liáozhì) - can all heal
- 一切眾生 (yīqiè zhòngshēng) - all sentient beings
- 瘡疣病不 (chuāngyóu bìng bù) - sores, warts, [and] diseases or not

"Bodhisattva Kāśyapa again addressed the Buddha saying: 'World-Honored One! [Can] worldly physicians all heal all sentient beings' sores, warts, [and] diseases or not?'"

### The Buddha's Response: Two Kinds of Afflictions (Lines 73-77)

**「善男子！世間瘡疣，凡有二種：一者可治，二不可治。凡可治者，醫則能治。不可治者，則不能治。」**

- 善男子 (shàn nánzǐ) - good son
- 世間瘡疣 (shìjiān chuāngyóu) - worldly sores and warts
- 凡有二種 (fán yǒu èr zhǒng) - generally have two kinds
- 一者可治 (yī zhě kě zhì) - the first can be treated
- 二不可治 (èr bù kě zhì) - the second cannot be treated
- 凡可治者 (fán kě zhì zhě) - generally those that can be treated
- 醫則能治 (yī zé néng zhì) - physicians then can treat
- 不可治者 (bù kě zhì zhě) - those that cannot be treated
- 則不能治 (zé bù néng zhì) - then [they] cannot treat

"'Good son! Worldly sores and warts generally have two kinds: the first can be treated, the second cannot be treated. Generally those that can be treated, physicians then can treat. Those that cannot be treated, then [they] cannot treat.'"

**迦葉復言：「如佛言者，如來則為於閻浮提治眾生已。若言治已，是諸眾生，其中云何復有未能得涅槃者？若未悉得，云何如來說言治竟，欲至他方？」**

- 如佛言者 (rú fó yán zhě) - according to the Buddha's words

- 於閻浮提 (yú yánfútí) - in Jambudvīpa

- 其中云何 (qí zhōng yúnhé) - among them how
- 復有未能得涅槃者 (fù yǒu wèi néng dé nièpán zhě) - again there are those not yet able to attain nirvāṇa
- 若未悉得 (ruò wèi xī dé) - if [they have] not all attained
- 云何如來說言治竟 (yúnhé rúlái shuō yán zhì jìng) - how [can] the Tathāgata say [the] healing [is] finished
- 欲至他方 (yù zhì tāfāng) - wishing to go to other directions

"Kāśyapa again said: 'According to the Buddha's words, the Tathāgata then in Jambudvīpa has healed sentient beings. If [you] say [they are] healed, [yet] these sentient beings, among them how [is it that] again there are those not yet able to attain nirvāṇa? If [they have] not all attained, how [can] the Tathāgata say [the] healing [is] finished, wishing to go to other directions?'"

**「善男子！閻浮提內眾生有二：一者有信，二者無信。有信之人，則名可治。何以故？定得涅槃，無瘡疣故，是故我說治閻浮提諸眾生已。無信之人，名一闡提，一闡提者，名不可治。除一闡提，餘悉治已，是故涅槃，名無瘡疣。」**

- 閻浮提內眾生有二 (yánfútí nèi zhòngshēng yǒu èr) - sentient beings within Jambudvīpa have two [kinds]
- 一者有信 (yī zhě yǒu xìn) - the first have faith
- 二者無信 (èr zhě wú xìn) - the second have no faith
- 有信之人 (yǒu xìn zhī rén) - people who have faith
- 則名可治 (zé míng kě zhì) - then [are] called treatable
- 何以故 (héyǐgù) - why is this
- 定得涅槃 (dìng dé nièpán) - certainly attain nirvāṇa
- 無瘡疣故 (wú chuāngyóu gù) - because [they are] without sores and warts
- 是故我說 (shìgù wǒ shuō) - therefore I say

- 無信之人 (wú xìn zhī rén) - people without faith
- 名一闡提 (míng yīchǎntí) - [are] called *icchantika*
- 一闡提者 (yīchǎntí zhě) - *icchantikas*

- 是故涅槃 (shìgù nièpán) - therefore nirvāṇa
- 名無瘡疣 (míng wú chuāngyóu) - [is] called without sores and warts

"'Good son! Sentient beings within Jambudvīpa have two [kinds]: the first have faith, the second have no faith. People who have faith then [are] called treatable. Why is this? [They will] certainly attain nirvāṇa, because [they are] without sores and warts. Therefore I say [I have] healed all sentient beings in Jambudvīpa. People without faith [are] called *icchantika*. *Icchantikas* [are] called untreatable. Except *icchantikas*, the rest [are] all healed. Therefore nirvāṇa [is] called without sores and warts.'"

## Key Terms Breakdown

### The Professor's Philological Analysis

**1. 大醫王 (dà yīwáng) - Great Physician King**

- **Sanskrit:** *mahābhiṣaj-rāja* (great physician king)
- **Literal meaning:** 大 (great) + 醫 (physician, healer) + 王 (king)
- **Why this translation:** This is one of the traditional epithets of the Buddha. The Chinese translators chose 醫王 (physician king) to convey both the Buddha's healing power and his supreme authority. The addition of 大 (great) emphasizes the universal scope of his healing activity.
- **Doctrinal significance:** The Buddha as physician is a foundational metaphor in Buddhism:
  - **The disease:** Suffering (*duḥkha*), caused by the three poisons (lust, anger, delusion)
  - **The diagnosis:** The Four Noble Truths
  - **The medicine:** The Dharma
  - **The cure:** Nirvāṇa
  
  The "king" designation indicates the Buddha is the supreme physician, able to cure afflictions that ordinary physicians cannot.

**2. 瘡疣 (chuāngyóu) - Sores and Warts**

- **Sanskrit:** Likely *vraṇa* (wound, sore)
- **Literal meaning:** 瘡 (sore, ulcer) + 疣 (wart, growth)
- **Why this translation:** Both characters refer to visible skin afflictions. The Chinese translators chose these terms to create a vivid metaphor for spiritual afflictions—just as sores and warts are visible signs of bodily disease, afflictions (*kleśa*) are the visible signs of spiritual disease.
- **Doctrinal significance:** The metaphor works on multiple levels:
  1. **Physical level:** Actual diseases that physicians treat
  2. **Spiritual level:** Afflictions (*kleśa*) that the Buddha treats
  3. **Soteriological level:** Nirvāṇa is "without sores and warts"—completely healed, free from all afflictions

**3. 一闡提 (yīchǎntí) - Icchantika**

- **Sanskrit:** *icchantika* (literally: "one who desires," but used to mean "one without the capacity for enlightenment")
- **Literal meaning:** Phonetic transliteration of Sanskrit
- **Why this translation:** This is one of the most controversial terms in Mahāyāna Buddhism. The Chinese translators preserved the Sanskrit through phonetic transliteration, indicating its technical importance.
- **Doctrinal significance:** The Nirvana Sutra's teaching on *icchantikas* is complex and has been debated for centuries:
  - **Provisional interpretation:** *Icchantikas* are beings who have completely severed all good roots and cannot attain enlightenment
  - **Ultimate interpretation:** Even *icchantikas* can eventually be saved (as stated elsewhere in the Nirvana Sutra)
  
  In this passage, the Buddha uses the physician metaphor: just as some diseases are incurable, some beings (temporarily) cannot be healed. But this doesn't mean they're permanently excluded—it means they're not ready yet.

**4. 甘露法藥 (gānlù fǎyào) - Ambrosia Dharma Medicine**

- **Sanskrit:** *amṛta-dharma-auṣadha* (immortality Dharma medicine)
- **Literal meaning:** 甘露 (sweet dew, ambrosia, nectar of immortality) + 法 (Dharma) + 藥 (medicine)
- **Why this translation:** 甘露 is the standard Chinese translation for Sanskrit *amṛta* (literally: "deathless, immortal"). The translators chose this poetic term to convey both the sweetness and the life-giving power of the Dharma.
- **Doctrinal significance:** *Amṛta* in Indian mythology is the nectar of immortality that the gods drink to become deathless. The Buddha's teaching is called "ambrosia" because it leads to the "deathless" state of nirvāṇa—not physical immortality but liberation from the cycle of birth and death.

## Lotus Sutra Connections

### The Professor's Cross-References

This passage has profound connections to the Lotus Sutra's teaching on the Buddha's compassionate activity:

**1. The Parable of the Excellent Physician (Lotus Chapter 16)**

The Great Physician parable in this section directly parallels the **Parable of the Excellent Physician** in Lotus Chapter 16:

In the Lotus Sutra parable, a physician's children drink poison. The father prepares medicine, but some children refuse to take it because their minds are deranged. The father uses skillful means—pretending to die—to shock them into taking the medicine.

The parallel:
- **The poison:** The three poisons (lust, anger, delusion) = affliction poison arrows
- **The physician:** The Buddha = Great Physician King
- **The medicine:** The Dharma = ambrosia Dharma medicine
- **The cure:** Nirvāṇa = without sores and warts
- **The children who refuse:** *Icchantikas* = untreatable beings

Both parables teach that the Buddha's compassionate activity is universal but not all beings are ready to receive the cure at the same time.

**2. The Buddha's Universal Compassion (Lotus Chapter 2)**

The Buddha's statement that he "travels to cities and villages, healing all sufferings" echoes Lotus Chapter 2's teaching on the Buddha's sole purpose:

> "The Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, appear in the world for one great cause alone: to open the door of Buddha-wisdom to all living beings, to show them Buddha-wisdom, to cause them to awaken to Buddha-wisdom, and to induce them to enter the path of Buddha-wisdom."

Both texts teach that the Buddha's activity is motivated solely by compassion—to heal all beings, to lead all beings to enlightenment.

**3. The Eternal Buddha's Manifestations (Lotus Chapter 16)**

The Buddha's statement that he "manifests as a Buddha in other directions to heal beings" directly parallels Lotus Chapter 16's teaching on the eternal Buddha:

> "Ever since then I have been constantly in this sahā world, preaching the Law, teaching, and converting. And elsewhere I have led and benefited living beings in hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of *nayutas* of lands."

Both texts teach that the Buddha's parinirvāṇa is not the end of his activity. He continues to manifest in countless worlds to heal beings—this is why it's called "great parinirvāṇa."

**4. Faith as the Condition for Salvation (Lotus Chapter 2)**

The Buddha's distinction between "treatable" beings (those with faith) and "untreatable" beings (*icchantikas* without faith) echoes the Lotus Sutra's emphasis on faith:

Lotus Chapter 2 states:

> "If there are living beings who have already made offerings to hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of Buddhas and have planted numerous good roots, when they hear this Law they will embrace it with faith."

Both texts teach that faith is the essential condition for receiving the Buddha's teaching. Without faith, even the Buddha's medicine cannot cure.

## Scholarly Notes

**The Physician Metaphor in Buddhism:**

The physician metaphor is foundational to Buddhist teaching. The Buddha's first sermon (the Deer Park sermon) is structured like a medical diagnosis:
1. **Disease:** Suffering (*duḥkha*)
2. **Cause:** Craving (*tṛṣṇā*)
3. **Prognosis:** Cessation (*nirodha*)
4. **Treatment:** The Eightfold Path (*mārga*)

This passage extends the metaphor by emphasizing the Buddha's universal healing activity—he doesn't just diagnose and prescribe; he actively travels to heal all beings.

**The Icchantika Controversy:**

The Nirvana Sutra's teaching on *icchantikas* sparked centuries of debate in East Asian Buddhism:
- **Question:** Can *icchantikas* eventually attain Buddhahood?
- **This passage suggests:** No—they're "untreatable"
- **Other Nirvana Sutra passages suggest:** Yes—even *icchantikas* have Buddha-nature

The resolution: *Icchantikas* are "untreatable" in their current state (without faith), but they can develop faith in the future. The Buddha has "healed all treatable beings" in this world and now goes to other worlds, but he will return when *icchantikas* become treatable.

**The "Great" in Great Nirvāṇa:**

The Buddha explains why his parinirvāṇa is called "great":
1. **Universal scope:** He heals beings in all worlds, not just one
2. **Eternal activity:** His healing work never ceases
3. **Ultimate cure:** He leads beings to complete liberation, not just temporary relief

This distinguishes the Buddha's nirvāṇa from the nirvāṇa of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, which is limited in scope and activity.
