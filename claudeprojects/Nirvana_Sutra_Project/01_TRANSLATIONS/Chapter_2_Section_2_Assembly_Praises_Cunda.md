**Line 14 - The Assembly's Praise:**
爾時大眾聞佛世尊，普為大會受於純陀最後供養，歡喜踊躍同聲讚言：「善哉，善哉！希有純陀！汝今立字，名不虛稱。言純陀者，名解妙義。汝今建立如是大義，是故依實從義立名，故名純陀。汝今現世得大名利，德願滿足。甚奇純陀！生在人中，復得難得無上之利。善哉純陀！如優曇花世間希有，佛出於世亦復甚難，值佛生信聞法復難，佛臨涅槃最後供養，能[6]辦是事復難於是。南無純陀，南無純陀！汝今已具檀波羅蜜，猶如秋月，十五日夜，清淨圓滿，無諸雲翳，一切眾生無不瞻仰；汝亦如是，而為我等之所瞻仰。佛已受汝最後供養，令汝具足檀波羅蜜。南無純陀！是故說汝如月盛滿，一切眾生無不瞻仰。南無純陀！雖受人身，心如佛心。汝今純陀，真是佛子，如羅睺羅，等無有異。」爾時大眾即說偈言：

「汝雖生人道，  \t已超第六天，
我及一切眾，  \t今故稽首請。
人中最勝尊，  \t今當入涅槃，
汝應愍我等，  \t唯願速請佛，
久住於世間，  \t利益無量眾，
演說智所讚，  \t無上甘露法。
汝若不請佛，  \t我命將不全，
是故應見為，  \t稽請調御師。」

爾時純陀歡喜踊躍，譬如有人，父母卒喪忽然還活，純陀歡喜亦復如是，復起禮佛，而說偈言：

**Literal translation:**

"At that time, the great assembly, hearing that the Buddha World-Honored One universally for the great assembly was receiving from Cunda the final offering, joyfully leaped up and with one voice praised saying:

'Excellent, excellent! Wonderful Cunda! Your established name is not falsely called. Speaking of "Cunda," the name means "understanding subtle meaning." You now have established such great meaning; therefore according to reality, following meaning, [your] name was established, thus [you are] named Cunda.

You now in the present world obtain great fame and benefit; [your] virtue and vows are fulfilled. Most wonderful Cunda! Born in the human realm, you again obtain the difficult-to-obtain unsurpassed benefit.

Excellent Cunda! Like the udumbara flower rarely existing in the world, a Buddha appearing in the world is also extremely difficult. Encountering a Buddha, generating faith, and hearing the dharma is again difficult. [When] the Buddha is approaching nirvāṇa, [to make] the final offering—being able to accomplish this matter is again more difficult than these.

Homage to Cunda! Homage to Cunda! You now have already perfected the perfection of giving. [You are] just like the autumn moon on the fifteenth night—pure and perfectly complete, without any obscuring clouds, [such that] all sentient beings without exception look up [to it in reverence]. You also are like this, and by us are looked up to.

The Buddha has received your final offering, causing you to perfect the perfection of giving. Homage to Cunda! Therefore we say you are like the moon fully abundant; all sentient beings without exception look up [to you].

Homage to Cunda! Although receiving a human body, [your] mind is like the Buddha's mind. You now, Cunda, truly are the Buddha's son, like Rāhula, equal without difference.'

At that time the great assembly then spoke verses saying:"

**Key terms:**
- **南無 (namo)** - Homage, reverence; from Sanskrit namas
- **優曇花 (udumbara)** - Legendary flower that blooms once in 3,000 years when a Buddha appears
- **檀波羅蜜 (dāna-pāramitā)** - Perfection of giving/generosity
- **瞻仰** - To look up reverently; to venerate
- **佛子** - "Buddha's son," a term for advanced practitioners or bodhisattvas

**Scholarly notes:**

The assembly's praise employs several rhetorical strategies:

1. **Etymology**: They interpret Cunda's name (純陀) as meaning "understanding subtle meaning" (解妙義), suggesting his spiritual insight matches his name.

2. **Four rare things**: A traditional Buddhist teaching about what's difficult to obtain:
   - Human birth
   - Buddha appearing in the world  
   - Meeting Buddha and generating faith
   - Making the final offering to Buddha

3. **Moon simile**: The full autumn moon (clearest in Chinese tradition) represents perfection. Cunda's perfected generosity makes him an object of universal reverence, like the moon.

4. **Rāhula comparison**: Equating Cunda with the Buddha's biological son elevates him to the highest status among disciples.

### Section 2: The Assembly's Verse (Lines 16-23)

**Verse structure:** Four-character lines in couplets (typical Chinese verse form)

**Line-by-line breakdown:**

**Couplet 1:**
汝雖生人道 (rǔ suī shēng rén dào) - "you although born human-path"
已超第六天 (yǐ chāo dì liù tiān) - "already surpassed sixth heaven"

**Couplet 2:**
我及一切眾 (wǒ jí yī qiè zhòng) - "I and all beings"
今故稽首請 (jīn gù jī shǒu qǐng) - "now therefore bow-head request"

**Couplet 3:**
人中最勝尊 (rén zhōng zuì shèng zūn) - "among humans most excellent honored-one"
今當入涅槃 (jīn dāng rù niè pán) - "now about-to enter nirvāṇa"

**Couplet 4:**
汝應愍我等 (rǔ yīng mǐn wǒ děng) - "you should pity us"
唯願速請佛 (wéi yuàn sù qǐng fó) - "only pray quickly request Buddha"

**Couplet 5:**
久住於世間 (jiǔ zhù yú shì jiān) - "long dwell in world"
利益無量眾 (lì yì wú liàng zhòng) - "benefit immeasurable beings"

**Couplet 6:**
演說智所讚 (yǎn shuō zhì suǒ zàn) - "expound what wisdom praises"
無上甘露法 (wú shàng gān lù fǎ) - "unsurpassed ambrosia dharma"

**Couplet 7:**
汝若不請佛 (rǔ ruò bù qǐng fó) - "you if not request Buddha"
我命將不全 (wǒ mìng jiāng bù quán) - "my life will not-be-complete"

**Couplet 8:**
是故應見為 (shì gù yīng jiàn wèi) - "therefore should for-our-sake"
稽請調御師 (jī qǐng tiáo yù shī) - "bow-request tamer-teacher"

**Literal translation:**

"You, although born in the human path,  
Have already surpassed the sixth heaven.

I and all beings  
Now therefore bow our heads in request:

The most excellent honored one among humans  
Is now about to enter nirvāṇa.

You should take pity on us—  
We only pray you quickly request the Buddha

To dwell long in the world,  
Benefiting immeasurable beings,

Expounding what wisdom praises,  
The unsurpassed ambrosia dharma.

If you do not request the Buddha,  
Our lives will not be complete.

Therefore you should for our sake  
Bow and request the tamer-teacher."

**Key terms:**
- **第六天 (sixth heaven)** - The highest heaven in the desire realm (Paranirmita-vaśavartin), ruled by Māra
- **調御師 (tamer/controller)** - One of the ten epithets of Buddha; one who tames beings
- **甘露法 (amṛta-dharma)** - Ambrosia dharma, deathless teaching

**Scholarly notes:**

The verse employs the traditional Chinese poetic form of parallel couplets. The assembly makes an urgent plea:

1. **Couplet 1**: Cunda has transcended even the highest heaven through his offering
2. **Couplets 2-6**: Therefore he should request Buddha to remain and teach
3. **Couplets 7-8**: Without Buddha, they cannot survive spiritually

The "sixth heaven" reference is significant—this is Māra's realm, the highest point in saṃsāra before transcendence. By surpassing it, Cunda has effectively achieved liberation through his act of generosity.

### Section 3: Cunda's Joyful Response (Line 24, Prose Introduction)

**Word-by-word breakdown:**

爾時 (ěr shí) - "at that time"
純陀 (chún tuó) - "Cunda"
歡喜踊躍 (huān xǐ yǒng yuè) - "joyfully leaping up"

譬如有人 (pì rú yǒu rén) - "for example like a person"
父母卒喪 (fù mǔ zú sàng) - "father mother suddenly died"
忽然還活 (hū rán huán huó) - "suddenly again alive"

純陀歡喜亦復如是 (chún tuó huān xǐ yì fù rú shì) - "Cunda's joy also again like this"
復起禮佛 (fù qǐ lǐ fó) - "again rising bowing-to Buddha"
而說偈言 (ér shuō jì yán) - "and speaking verse saying"

**Literal translation:**

"At that time Cunda joyfully leaped up. [It was] like a person whose father and mother suddenly died [but then] suddenly came back to life. Cunda's joy was also again like this. [He] again rose, bowed to the Buddha, and spoke verses saying:"

**Key terms:**
- **卒喪** - Sudden death
- **還活** - Return to life, resurrection

**Scholarly notes:**
The assembly's praise uses the metaphor of the full moon (滿月) to describe Cunda's perfection through his offering. The comparison to Rāhula (the Buddha's biological son) elevates Cunda to the status of a true dharma-son.

## Key Terms Breakdown

### The Professor's Philological Analysis

**1. 龍象菩薩 (lóng xiàng pú sà) - Dragon-Elephant Bodhisattvas**

- **Sanskrit:** *nāga-gaja bodhisattva*
- **Literal meaning:** 龍 (dragon) + 象 (elephant) + 菩薩 (bodhisattva)
- **Why this translation:** The compound 龍象 combines two powerful creatures from Indian cosmology. 龍 (nāga) represents spiritual power and transformation, while 象 (gaja/elephant) represents physical strength and steadfastness. Together they metaphorically describe great bodhisattvas who possess both spiritual wisdom and unshakeable resolve.
- **Doctrinal significance:** This term designates senior, accomplished bodhisattvas who are leaders in the sangha—those who have "severed bonds and outflows" (斷諸結漏).

**2. 檀波羅蜜 (tán bō luó mì) - Dāna-pāramitā**

- **Sanskrit:** *dāna-pāramitā*
- **Literal meaning:** 檀 (giving/charity) + 波羅蜜 (perfection/gone to the other shore)
- **Why this translation:** 檀 is a phonetic approximation of *dāna*. 波羅蜜 phonetically renders *pāramitā* while also carrying the semantic meaning of "crossing to the other shore" (波羅 = *pāra* = other shore; 蜜 = *mita* = gone). This dual phonetic-semantic translation is characteristic of Chinese Buddhist translation technique.
- **Doctrinal significance:** The first of the six perfections (pāramitās). The assembly declares Cunda has perfected this through his final offering to the Buddha.

**3. 羅睺羅 (luó hóu luó) - Rāhula**

- **Sanskrit:** *Rāhula*
- **Literal meaning:** Pure phonetic transliteration
- **Why this translation:** 羅睺羅 is a phonetic rendering of the Sanskrit name. The name *Rāhula* literally means "fetter" or "impediment" in Sanskrit, referring to the Buddha's son born before his renunciation. Chinese translators preserved the name phonetically rather than translating its meaning.
- **Doctrinal significance:** Rāhula was the Buddha's biological son and became one of his chief disciples. Comparing Cunda to Rāhula means declaring him a true "son of the Buddha" through dharma, not blood.

**4. 滿月 (mǎn yuè) - Full Moon**

- **Sanskrit:** *pūrṇa-candra*
- **Literal meaning:** 滿 (full/complete) + 月 (moon)
- **Why this translation:** Direct semantic translation. The full moon is a universal symbol of perfection, completeness, and radiance in both Indian and Chinese culture. The autumn full moon (秋滿月) is especially auspicious.
- **Doctrinal significance:** The full moon metaphor appears throughout Buddhist literature to describe enlightenment, perfection, and the Buddha himself. Here it describes Cunda's spiritual completion through his offering.

## Lotus Sutra Connections

### The Professor's Cross-References

**1. Praise of Dharma Practitioners**

The assembly's elaborate praise of Cunda for making an offering parallels the Lotus Sutra's teaching on honoring those who uphold the dharma:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 10 (The Teacher of the Dharma):** Those who receive, uphold, read, recite, or make offerings to the Lotus Sutra deserve reverence. Similarly, Cunda's final offering to the Buddha makes him worthy of the assembly's praise.
- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 23 (The Bodhisattva Medicine King):** The chapter describes elaborate offerings to Buddhas and how such offerings create immense merit. Cunda's offering is the ultimate expression of this principle.

**2. The Full Moon Metaphor**

The comparison of Cunda to the full moon connects to:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 27 (King Wonderful Adornment):** Uses celestial imagery (sun, moon, stars) to describe spiritual perfection and the Buddha's radiance.
- The full moon specifically symbolizes the complete teaching and perfect enlightenment throughout Mahāyāna literature.

**3. Becoming a "Son of the Buddha"**

The assembly's declaration that Cunda is "like Rāhula, no difference" parallels:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 2 (Skillful Means):** All beings can become "children of the Buddha" through the dharma, not through biological relationship.
- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 4 (Belief and Understanding):** The parable of the poor son who is actually the heir to vast wealth—all beings are dharma-heirs of the Buddha.

**4. Merit of Final Offerings**

The teaching that Cunda's final offering perfects dāna-pāramitā connects to:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 10:** Even small offerings to the dharma create boundless merit. The final offering to the Buddha represents the culmination of this principle.
