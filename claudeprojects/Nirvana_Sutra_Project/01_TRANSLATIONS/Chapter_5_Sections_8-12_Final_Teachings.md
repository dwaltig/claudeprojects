## Section 8: Three Refuges & One Meaning (Lines 156-161)

### The Professor's Translation

**Kāśyapa's Question:**
"World-Honored One! If nirvāṇa, Buddha-nature, certainty, and the Tathāgata are one meaning, why do [we] say there are three refuges?"

**The Buddha's Answer:**
"Good son! All sentient beings fear birth and death, therefore [they] seek the three refuges. Because of the three refuges, [they] then know Buddha-nature, certainty, nirvāṇa. Good son! There are dharmas [with] one name [but] different meanings; there are dharmas [with] both name and meaning different. 'One name, different meanings' means: Buddha is permanent, Dharma is permanent, the Saṅgha is permanent, nirvāṇa and space are both also permanent—this is called 'one name, different meanings.' 'Both name and meaning different' means: Buddha is called 'awakening,' Dharma is called 'non-awakening,' Saṅgha is called 'harmony,' nirvāṇa is called 'liberation,' space is called 'neither good nor obstructed'—this is 'both name and meaning different.'"

### The Bluesman's Version

Kāśyapa said: 'Lord, if nirvāṇa, Buddha-nature, and the Tathāgata are all the same thing, why do we take refuge in **three** things—Buddha, Dharma, Saṅgha?'

The Lord said: 'Good question. People are scared of birth and death, so they seek the three refuges. And through the three refuges, they come to know Buddha-nature and nirvāṇa.

'Now listen: Sometimes different things share the same **name**. Sometimes things have different **names** and different **meanings**.

'**Same name, different meanings:** Buddha is permanent, Dharma is permanent, Saṅgha is permanent, nirvāṇa is permanent, space is permanent. They all share the quality of **permanence**, but they're different things.

'**Different names, different meanings:** Buddha means "awakening." Dharma means "non-awakening" (the teaching). Saṅgha means "harmony." Nirvāṇa means "liberation." Space means "neither good nor obstructed." Different names, different meanings.

'So the three refuges are **three**, not one. But they all point toward the same ultimate reality.'

## Section 9: Bliss Without Receiver (Lines 162-168)

### The Professor's Translation

**Kāśyapa's Question:**
"As the Buddha has said, 'Ultimate bliss is called nirvāṇa'—what is this meaning? Nirvāṇa abandons body and wisdom. If [it] abandons body and wisdom, who receives bliss?"

**The Buddha's Answer (Parable of Vomiting):**
"Good son! Like a person [who] after eating feels nauseated, goes outside wanting to vomit. Having vomited, [he] returns. [His] companion asks: 'Your illness—is it cured or not? Why have you returned?' [He] answers: 'Already cured. [My] body has obtained peace.' The Tathāgata is also thus—ultimately far removed from the twenty-five existences, permanently obtaining nirvāṇa's place of peace, immovable, without exhaustion or extinction, severing all reception, called 'bliss without reception.' Such non-reception is called permanent bliss."

### The Bluesman's Version

Kāśyapa said: 'Lord, You say nirvāṇa is ultimate bliss. But nirvāṇa means giving up the body and giving up the mind. So if there's no body and no mind, **who** experiences the bliss?'

The Lord said: 'Let Me tell you a story. A man eats something bad and feels sick. He goes outside and vomits. After he vomits, he comes back. His friend asks, "Are you better now?" He says, "Yeah, I'm better. I feel relief. I feel peace."

'Now, did he **receive** something to feel better? No. He **got rid** of something. He vomited out the poison. And in getting rid of it, he felt relief.

'That's what nirvāṇa is like. You don't **receive** bliss like you receive a gift. You **experience** bliss by **letting go** of all the suffering, all the afflictions, all the poison.

'It's called "bliss without reception." You ain't receiving nothing. You're just **free**. And that freedom **is** the bliss.'

## Section 10: Not-Birth-Not-Death vs. Space (Lines 169-194)

### The Professor's Translation

**Kāśyapa's Question:**
"If not-birth-not-death is liberation, space's nature is also without birth and death—should [it] be the Tathāgata?"

**The Buddha's Answer (Bird Analogy):**
"Good son! Like the kalavinka bird and the jīvajīvaka bird—their voices are clear and wonderful. Can [they] be the same as crows and magpies' sounds?"

"No, World-Honored One! Crows and magpies' sounds compared to the jīvajīvaka, [even] a hundred thousand myriad times cannot be compared."

**The Buddha's Teaching:**
"The Tathāgata sometimes, because of causes and conditions, uses space as an analogy for liberation. [But] such liberation is the Tathāgata. True liberation—all humans and gods cannot match [it]. Yet this space is actually not its analogy. To transform sentient beings, [I] use space as a non-analogy analogy."

### The Bluesman's Version

Kāśyapa said: 'Lord, You say liberation is unborn and undying. Well, **space** is also unborn and undying. So is space the same as the Tathāgata?'

The Lord said: 'Good question. Let Me ask you something: You know those beautiful birds—the kalavinka and the jīvajīvaka—with their sweet, melodious songs? Can you compare their songs to a crow's caw?'

Kāśyapa said: 'No way, Lord! A crow's caw compared to those birds? Not even close. Not even a million times close.'

The Lord said: 'Exactly. Now, I sometimes use **space** as an analogy for liberation. I say liberation is like space—vast, open, free. But that's just an **analogy**. It's a **pointer**. It ain't the real thing.

'True liberation—the Tathāgata—is beyond all comparison. Nothing in the human or divine realms can match it. Space ain't really a good analogy. But I use it anyway, because I gotta use **something** to help you understand.

'It's like comparing a crow to a kalavinka. They're both birds, but one is infinitely more beautiful. Same thing: Space and liberation are both "unborn and undying," but liberation is infinitely greater.'

## Section 11: Two Kinds of Statements & Parables (Lines 195-216)

### The Professor's Translation

**Parable of the Man Trying to Kill His Mother:**
The Buddha tells a parable of a man who tries to kill his mother hiding in a grain stack. He slashes the stack with his sword, thinking he's killed her, but she escapes. Question: Did he commit matricide?

Answer: He didn't actually kill her (no crime), but he intended to kill her (still guilty of the intention).

**The Buddha's Teaching on Analogies:**
"Because of this cause and condition, I speak various skillful analogies to explain liberation. Although [I use] immeasurable *asaṃkhyeya* analogies, [liberation] actually cannot be compared by analogies. Sometimes because of causes and conditions, [it] can be explained by analogy; sometimes because of causes and conditions, [it] cannot be explained by analogy."

### The Bluesman's Version

The Lord said: 'Let Me tell you another story. A man wants to kill his mother. She's hiding in a stack of grain. He takes his sword and slashes the grain stack all around, thinking he's killed her. He's happy, thinking she's dead. But she escapes and goes home.

'Now, did he commit matricide?'

Kāśyapa said: 'That's tricky, Lord. He didn't actually kill her, so in one sense, no crime. But he **intended** to kill her and thought he did, so in another sense, he's guilty.'

The Lord said: 'Exactly. That's how analogies work. Sometimes they fit perfectly. Sometimes they don't. I use all kinds of analogies—space, birds, jars, vomiting—to help you understand liberation. But none of them fully capture it. They're just **pointers**. They're just **fingers pointing at the moon**.

'Liberation has immeasurable qualities. The Tathāgata has immeasurable qualities. And because of these immeasurable qualities, it's called **great nirvāṇa**.'

## Section 12: Kāśyapa's Realization & Colophon (Lines 214-220)

### The Professor's Translation

**Kāśyapa's Realization:**
"World-Honored One! I now begin to know the Tathāgata's place is without exhaustion. [If the] place is without exhaustion, [I] should know the lifespan is also without exhaustion."

**The Buddha's Praise:**
"Excellent, excellent! Good son! You now skillfully protect and uphold the true Dharma. If there are good sons and good daughters who wish to sever afflictions and all bondage, [they] should thus protect and uphold the true Dharma."

**Colophon:**
*Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra, Fascicle 5*

### The Bluesman's Version

Kāśyapa said: 'Lord, now I understand. The Tathāgata's place—Your dwelling—is **inexhaustible**. It never runs out. It never ends. And if Your place is inexhaustible, then Your lifespan must also be inexhaustible. You're **eternal**, Lord.'

The Lord said: 'Excellent, Kāśyapa! Excellent! You got it. You understand. You're protecting the true Dharma. And anybody who wants to be free—anybody who wants to cut through all the afflictions and bondage—they should do what you're doing. They should protect the Dharma. They should understand the truth.'
