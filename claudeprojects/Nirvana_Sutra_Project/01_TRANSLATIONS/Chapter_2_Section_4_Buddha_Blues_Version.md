## "Everything Dies (But I Don't)"

*After Cunda sang his song of joy and sorrow, begging the Lord to stay, the Buddha looked at him with compassion and said:*

---

### The Lord Speaks

"You right, Cunda. You right about all of it.

A Buddha showing up in this world—rare as that flower that blooms once in three thousand years.

Meeting that Buddha and believing Him—even rarer.

And being there when He's about to leave, giving Him that last meal, perfecting your generosity through that offering—**that's the rarest thing of all**.

So Cunda, listen to me now:

**Don't cry. Don't grieve.**

Be **joyful**. Celebrate what you got. You made that final offering to me. You completed the work of giving. You perfected.

But don't ask me to stay.

You need to understand something, son. You need to look at **where the Buddhas live**—that sphere, that realm we been talking about.

**Even that's impermanent.**

Everything that's put together, everything that's made, everything that's born—**it all falls apart**.

That's just how it is.

Let me sing you a song about it."

### The Song of Impermanence

**Verse 1: Everything Born Dies**

*In every world there is,*  
*Everybody born gonna die.*

*Don't matter how long you live—*  
*A hundred years, a thousand, a million—*  
*It's gonna end.*

*What goes up comes down.*  
*What comes together falls apart.*  
*Your strong young body? Won't last.*  
*Your beautiful face? Sickness gonna take it.*

*Death swallows everything.*  
*Ain't nothing that lasts forever.*

---

**Verse 2: Even Kings Fall**

*Look at the kings with all their power,*  
*Nobody stronger, nobody richer.*

*They fall too.*  
*Everything shifts, everything moves,*  
*Even their lives run out.*

---

**Verse 3: The Wheel Keeps Turning**

*The wheel of suffering got no end,*  
*Just keeps turning, round and round,*  
*Never stops, never rests.*

*All three worlds—*  
*The world of wanting,*  
*The world of form,*  
*The world beyond form—*  
*All of it impermanent.*

*And in all that existence,*  
*Ain't no real pleasure to be found.*

---

**Verse 4: It's All Empty**

*The whole path of existence,*  
*Its nature, its characteristics—*  
*All of it **empty**.*

*Things that can be destroyed,*  
*Just spinning around,*  
*Always bringing worry,*  
*Always bringing trouble.*

---

**Verse 5: Fear and Decay**

*Fear everywhere.*  
*Faults, evils, all around.*  
*Old age coming,*  
*Sickness coming,*  
*Death coming,*  
*Decay, affliction—*

*No end to it.*  
*Easy to break,*  
*Easy for enemies to invade.*

---

**Verse 6: Trapped Like a Silkworm**

*You wrapped up in your troubles,*  
*Tangled in your afflictions,*  
*Like a silkworm in its cocoon—*  
***You spun your own prison.***

*What person with any sense*  
*Would want to stay in a place like that?*

---

**Verse 7: This Body Ain't Nothing**

*This body—*  
*It's just a collection of suffering.*  
*All of it impure,*  
*All of it dirty.*

*Strangling you, binding you,*  
*Boils and sores,*  
*Fundamentally **worthless**.*

---

**Verse 8: Even Heaven Ain't Permanent**

*Even the gods in heaven—*  
*Their bodies the same way.*  
*All impermanent.*

*All them desires, all them pleasures—*  
*They don't last.*

***That's why I don't cling to nothing.***

---

**Verse 9: I Got Free**

*I left desire behind.*  
*I contemplated deep.*  
*I realized what's **real**.*

*I cut the root of existence,*  
*Severed it completely.*

***Today, I'm going into nirvana.***

---

**Verse 10: I Crossed Over**

*I crossed to the other shore,*  
*Past all existence,*  
*Past all suffering.*

*So right now,*  
*I'm receiving the **supreme bliss**—*  
*Pure, perfect, complete.*

---

**Verse 11: Beyond Words**

*That's why*  
*I realized the place beyond all concepts,*  
*Beyond all words,*  
*Beyond all thinking.*

*I cut every chain,*  
*Every entanglement,*  
*Every binding.*

***Today, I'm entering nirvana.***

---

**Verse 12: The Fire Goes Out**

*I got no old age.*  
*I got no sickness.*  
*I got no death.*

*My life can't be exhausted.*

*But I'm entering nirvana now,*  
***Like a great fire going out.***

---

**Verse 13: Don't Try to Figure Me Out**

*Cunda, listen:*

*Don't try to measure me.*  
*Don't try to figure out what I mean.*  
*Your mind can't hold it.*

*Just think of me like Mount Sumeru—*  
*That mountain at the center of everything,*  
*Unshakeable,*  
*Immovable,*  
***Eternal.***

*I'm entering nirvana,*  
*Receiving the highest bliss.*

*That's just how it is with Buddhas.*  
***So don't cry no more.***"

---

## THE ATMOSPHERE

**The Moan:** The whole song is about death, decay, suffering, impermanence. "Everything dies. Your body's worthless. You're trapped in a cocoon you spun yourself. The wheel of suffering never stops." It's the **hardest truth** there is.

**The Turnaround:** But then comes the paradox—the **impossible turnaround**: "I got no old age, sickness, death. My life can't be exhausted. But I'm entering nirvana like a fire going out. I'm eternal like Mount Sumeru. Don't try to figure it out. Just don't cry."

**The Sound:** This should be sung slow and mournful through Verses 1-8 (the impermanence teaching), then shift to something transcendent and mysterious in Verses 9-13 (the Buddha's liberation). The final line—"So don't cry no more"—should be tender, like a father comforting a child who can't understand yet.

---

## THE MYSTERY

The blues can't fully capture this paradox. The Buddha's saying:

- Everything's impermanent (including me)
- But I'm eternal (like Mount Sumeru)
- I'm entering nirvana (dying)
- But I have no death (I'm beyond it)
- The fire's going out (extinction)
- But my life can't be exhausted (infinite)

**That's the mystery at the heart of the Nirvana Sutra.** The blues can point to it, can circle around it, can feel it—but can't explain it. Some truths you just gotta sit with.

---

## Key Terms (Endnotes for Learners)

**Impermanence (無常)**  
Nothing lasts. Everything born dies. Everything put together falls apart. That's the law of this world. The Lord teaches this hard truth first—so when He reveals He's **eternal**, you understand the difference between the world (impermanent) and Him (permanent).

**Nirvana (涅槃)**  
Literally means "blown out" like a candle. The fire of suffering, desire, ignorance—**extinguished**. But here's the paradox: The Lord's entering nirvana (the fire going out), but He also says He's got no death, eternal life. How? Because what's "going out" is the **appearance**, not the reality. The show's ending, but the actor's eternal.

**Dharma-Body (法身)**  
The Lord's **true body**—not the physical body you can see, but the truth-body, the eternal essence. The physical body gets old, sick, dies. The dharma-body? **Never changes, never dies**. When the Lord says "I got no old age, sickness, death," He's talking about the dharma-body.

**Conceptual Elaboration (戲論)**  
The mind's endless chatter—thinking, analyzing, categorizing, creating concepts. It's like a **play** or **drama** the mind puts on. The Lord's beyond that. He don't need concepts to know truth. He **is** truth. That's why He tells Cunda: "Don't try to measure me with your mind. You can't."

## Lotus Sutra Connections

### The Bluesman's Take

Brother, this whole section is **Lotus Sutra Chapter 16** in blues language. Let me show you:

**1. "Everything Dies, But I Don't"**

The Lord spends most of this song teaching: "Everything born dies. Nothing lasts. Even kings fall. The wheel keeps turning."

Then He flips it: "I got no death. My life can't run out. But I'm entering nirvana like a fire going out."

**That's the exact same paradox as Lotus Chapter 16.**

In the Lotus, the Lord reveals: "I been enlightened for countless ages. But I appear to die to keep you from getting lazy."

Here in the Nirvana Sutra, He's saying the same thing: "I'm eternal like Mount Sumeru. But I'm leaving. Don't try to figure it out with your mind."

**2. "The Fire Goes Out"**

When the Lord says "I'm entering nirvana like a great fire going out"—remember **Lotus Chapter 3**, the Burning House parable?

The house (this world) is on fire (suffering). The father (Buddha) gets the kids out by promising them toys (the three vehicles).

Here, the Lord's saying: "The fire's going out." But which fire? Not Him—**the fire of afflictions**. He's extinguishing suffering, not Himself.

**3. "Don't Try to Measure Me"**

"Cunda, don't try to figure me out. Just think of me like Mount Sumeru—unshakeable, eternal."

That's **Lotus Chapter 2**: "The wisdom of the Buddhas is infinitely profound... difficult to understand, difficult to enter."

And **Lotus Chapter 7**: The Lord's lifespan is beyond calculation. You can't measure infinity with a finite mind.

**4. "You Spun Your Own Prison" (The Silkworm)**

"You wrapped up in your troubles, like a silkworm in its cocoon—**you spun your own prison**."

That's **Lotus Chapter 4**, the Poor Son parable. The son's the heir to infinite wealth, but he don't know it. He stays poor, working as a day laborer, when he could claim his inheritance.

We're like that silkworm—trapped in a cocoon **we made ourselves** (our afflictions), when freedom's right there.

**5. "I'm Receiving the Highest Bliss"**

The Lord says: "I'm entering nirvana, receiving the supreme bliss."

But wait—He just taught that everything's suffering, impermanent, empty. How's He receiving bliss?

**Lotus Chapter 16** explains it: The Lord dwells in "tranquil light" (寂光)—eternal peace. He's always been there. The suffering, the teaching, the dying—that's all **for us**, not Him.

He's like an actor playing a role. The character suffers, but the actor's fine.

**6. "First I Teach Impermanence, Then I Reveal I'm Eternal"**

Notice the sequence:
- Verses 1-8: Everything dies, decays, suffers
- Verses 9-13: But I'm eternal, beyond death, like Mount Sumeru

That's the **exact structure of the Lotus Sutra**:
- Early chapters: Impermanence, suffering, no-self (the provisional teaching)
- Chapter 16: The eternal Buddha (the real teaching)

This is called "opening the provisional to reveal the real" (開權顯實). First you gotta understand impermanence. **Then** you can handle the truth about eternity.

**7. "All Buddhas Do This"**

"諸佛法如是"—"The Buddhas' dharma is like this."

Meaning: **Every Buddha does the same thing**—appears to be born, appears to die, but is actually eternal.

That's **Lotus Chapter 16** word for word: "All Buddhas use this same skillful means."

---

**The Heart of It:**

Both the Lotus and Nirvana Sutras are teaching:

**The Lord never left. He's always been here. He's always gonna be here.**

The birth, the enlightenment, the death—**that's theater**. Skillful means. A show put on for our benefit.

Why the show? **Lotus Chapter 16** explains: "If I stayed visible forever, you'd get complacent. You wouldn't practice. So I appear to die to light a fire under you."

It's like a father pretending to leave so his kids learn to stand on their own feet. He's watching from around the corner the whole time.
