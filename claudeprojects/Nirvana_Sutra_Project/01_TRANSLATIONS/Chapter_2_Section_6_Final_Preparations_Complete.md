### Section 5: Cunda's Understanding (Line 138)

**Word-by-word breakdown:**

爾時純陀復白佛言 (ěr shí chún tuó fù bái fó yán) - "at that time Cunda again addressed Buddha saying"

如是如是，誠如尊教 (rú shì rú shì chéng rú zūn jiào) - "so it is, so it is, truly as honored teaching"

雖知如來方便示現入於涅槃 (suī zhī rú lái fāng biàn shì xiàn rù yú niè pán) - "although knowing Tathāgata skillful-means manifesting entering nirvāṇa"

而我不能不懷苦惱 (ér wǒ bù néng bù huái kǔ nǎo) - "yet I not able not harbor suffering distress"

覆自思惟，復生慶悅 (fù zì sī wéi fù shēng qìng yuè) - "again self contemplating, again producing celebration joy"

**Literal translation:**

"At that time Cunda again addressed the Buddha saying: 'So it is, so it is, truly as the honored teaching [says]. Although [I] know the Tathāgata [is using] skillful means, manifesting entering nirvāṇa, yet I am not able to not harbor suffering and distress. [But when I] again contemplate [this] myself, [I] again produce celebration and joy.'"

**Scholarly notes:**

Cunda demonstrates mature understanding—he knows intellectually that the Buddha's nirvāṇa is skillful means (upāya), yet he still experiences genuine emotional pain. This holding of both truths simultaneously (intellectual understanding and emotional response) is praised by the Buddha.

何以故 (hé yǐ gù) - "why"

我是眾生良福田故 (wǒ shì zhòng shēng liáng fú tián gù) - "I am sentient-beings' good merit-field"

**Literal translation:**

"Cunda! I now receive the offering you present, for wishing to cause you to cross [beyond] the birth-death [and] various existence-flows.

If various humans [and] gods make this final offering to me, all entirely should obtain unshakeable fruit-reward, constantly receiving peace and happiness.

或有地動，或大地動 (huò yǒu dì dòng huò dà dì dòng) - "either is earth-movement, or great-earth-movement"

**The Six Distinctions:**

1. **By Magnitude:**

   - 大動者名大地動 (dà dòng zhě míng dà dì dòng) - "large movement called great-earth-movement"

2. **By Sound:**
   - 有小聲者名曰地動 (yǒu xiǎo shēng zhě míng yuē dì dòng) - "having small sound called earth-movement"
   - 有大聲者名大地動 (yǒu dà shēng zhě míng dà dì dòng) - "having large sound called great-earth-movement"

3. **By Scope:**
   - 獨地動者名曰地動 (dú dì dòng zhě míng yuē dì dòng) - "only earth moving called earth-movement"
   - 山河樹木及大海水一切動者，名大地動 (shān hé shù mù jí dà hǎi shuǐ yī qiè dòng zhě míng dà dì dòng) - "mountains rivers trees wood and great ocean water all moving, called great-earth-movement"

4. **By Direction:**

Only the earth moving is called earth-movement; mountains, rivers, trees, wood, and the great ocean water all moving is called great-earth-movement.

Moving in one direction is called earth-movement; circling [and] rotating is called great-earth-movement.

Moving is called earth-movement; moving [such that it is] able to cause sentient beings' hearts to move is called great-earth-movement."

**The Six Occasions of Great Earthquakes:**

菩薩初從兜率天下閻浮提時名大地動 (pú sà chū cóng dōu shuài tiān xià yán fú tí shí míng dà dì dòng) - "bodhisattva first descending from Tuṣita heaven to Jambudvīpa time, called great-earth-movement"

從初生、出家、成阿耨多羅三藐三菩提、轉於法輪及般涅槃名大地動 (cóng chū shēng chū jiā chéng ā nòu duō luó sān miǎo sān pú tí zhuǎn yú fǎ lún jí bān niè pán míng dà dì dòng) - "from first birth, leaving-home, accomplishing *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*, turning dharma-wheel, and entering nirvāṇa, called great-earth-movement"

今日如來將入涅槃，是故此地如是大動 (jīn rì rú lái jiāng rù niè pán shì gù cǐ dì rú shì dà dòng) - "today Tathāgata about-to enter nirvāṇa, therefore this earth thus greatly moves"

**Literal translation:**

"[When the] bodhisattva first descends from Tuṣita heaven to Jambudvīpa, [it is] called great-earth-movement.

From [his] first birth, leaving home [to become a monk], accomplishing *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*, turning the dharma-wheel, and entering parinirvāṇa—[these are all] called great-earth-movement.

Today the Tathāgata is about to enter nirvāṇa. Therefore this earth thus greatly moves."

**Key terms:**
- **兜率天 (Tuṣita heaven)** - The heaven where bodhisattvas dwell before their final birth
- **閻浮提 (Jambudvīpa)** - The southern continent; the human world
- **轉法輪 (dharmacakra-pravartana)** - Turning the dharma-wheel; first teaching

**Scholarly notes:**

The six occasions of great earthquakes mark the Buddha's key life events:
1. Descent from Tuṣita heaven
2. Birth
3. Renunciation (leaving home)
4. Enlightenment
5. First teaching (turning the dharma-wheel)
6. Parinirvāṇa (final nirvāṇa)

These cosmic responses indicate that the Buddha's life events are not merely personal but universal, affecting the entire cosmos.

## Key Terms Breakdown

### The Professor's Philological Analysis

**1. 方便 (fāng biàn) - Upāya (Skillful Means)**

- **Sanskrit:** *upāya* or *upāya-kauśalya*
- **Literal meaning:** 方 (method/way) + 便 (convenient/expedient)
- **Why this translation:** The Chinese brilliantly captures the pragmatic, adaptive nature of *upāya*—teachings and methods that are "convenient" or "expedient" for leading beings to liberation, even if not ultimately true in themselves.
- **Doctrinal significance:** Cunda's understanding that the Buddha's nirvāṇa is "skillful means" shows mature insight. The Buddha's entire life narrative—including his apparent death—is pedagogical theater for beings' benefit.

**2. 福田 (fú tián) - Puṇya-kṣetra (Merit-Field)**

- **Sanskrit:** *puṇya-kṣetra*
- **Literal meaning:** 福 (merit/blessing) + 田 (field)
- **Why this translation:** Agricultural metaphor perfectly rendering the Sanskrit. Just as a farmer plants seeds in a field to harvest crops, beings "plant" good deeds (offerings, practice) in the Buddha (the field) to "harvest" merit and liberation.
- **Doctrinal significance:** The Buddha declares himself the supreme merit-field. Any offering to him produces infinite karmic fruit. Cunda's final offering is the ultimate "planting" in the best possible field.

**3. 六種震動 (liù zhǒng zhèn dòng) - Six Kinds of Earthquakes**

- **Sanskrit:** *ṣaḍ-vikāra* (six changes/movements)
- **Literal meaning:** 六 (six) + 種 (kinds) + 震動 (shake move)
- **Why this translation:** Direct semantic translation. The text systematically categorizes earthquakes by six criteria: magnitude, sound, scope, direction, duration, and psychological effect.
- **Doctrinal significance:** The elaborate classification emphasizes that this is not an ordinary earthquake but a cosmic response to the Buddha's imminent parinirvāṇa. The universe itself responds to this momentous event.

**4. 兜率天 (dōu shuài tiān) - Tuṣita Heaven**

- **Sanskrit:** *Tuṣita*
- **Literal meaning:** Phonetic approximation + 天 (heaven)
- **Why this translation:** 兜率 phonetically renders *Tuṣita*. This is the fourth of the six desire-realm heavens, where bodhisattvas dwell before their final birth as Buddhas.
- **Doctrinal significance:** The Buddha's descent from Tuṣita marks the beginning of his final life leading to Buddhahood. This is the first of the six great earthquake occasions.

## Lotus Sutra Connections

### The Professor's Cross-References

**1. Skillful Means Nirvāṇa**

Cunda's understanding that the Buddha's nirvāṇa is skillful means directly parallels:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 16 (Lifespan of the Tathāgata):** The Buddha's apparent death is *upāya* to prevent beings from becoming complacent. He states: "If I stayed visible forever, beings would not plant good roots. Therefore I use skillful means, appearing to enter nirvāṇa."

**2. The Famous Impermanence Verse**

The verse "All conditioned things—their nature is impermanent. Once born, they don't abide. Extinction-quiescence is bliss" appears in various Buddhist texts and connects to:

- **Lotus Sutra's structure:** The sutra first teaches impermanence (provisional teaching) before revealing the eternal Buddha (ultimate teaching). This pedagogical sequence—impermanence first, eternity later—is the "opening of the provisional to reveal the real" (開權顯實).

**3. The Śāla-Śāla Birds at Lake Anavatapta**

The Buddha's teaching that "all Buddhas gather at this place" like seasonal birds parallels:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 11 (The Emergence of the Jeweled Stupa):** Countless Buddhas from all directions gather for the Lotus Sutra assembly. The teaching: all Buddhas share the same dharma, the same purpose, the same ultimate destination.

**4. Merit of Final Offerings**

The teaching that the final offering produces "unshakeable fruit-reward" connects to:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 10 (The Teacher of the Dharma):** Even small offerings to the dharma create boundless merit. The final offering to the Buddha represents the culmination of this principle.
- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 23 (Medicine King):** Describes elaborate offerings to Buddhas and their immense karmic results.

**5. The Six Great Earthquakes**

The cosmic response (earthquakes) to the Buddha's key life events parallels:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 1 (Introduction):** The Buddha emits light and the earth trembles before teaching the Lotus Sutra, signaling that something of cosmic significance is about to occur.
- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 11:** When the jeweled stupa emerges, the earth shakes, indicating the appearance of countless Buddhas.

**6. Holding Both Truths Simultaneously**

Cunda's ability to know intellectually that nirvāṇa is skillful means while still feeling emotional pain demonstrates the two-truth framework:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 2 (Skillful Means):** The Buddha teaches according to the two truths—conventional (the Buddha dies) and ultimate (the Buddha is eternal). Mature practitioners can hold both simultaneously.
