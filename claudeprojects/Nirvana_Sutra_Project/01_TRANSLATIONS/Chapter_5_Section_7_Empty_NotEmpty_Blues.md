### 'The Jar That's Empty and Full'

The Lord said:

'Liberation is called **empty-not-empty**. Let Me explain what that means.

'Imagine you got jars—jars for water, wine, yogurt, butter, honey. Now, even when those jars are empty—when there ain't no water or wine or yogurt in them—you still call them "water jars" or "wine jars" or "yogurt jars," right?

'But here's the question: Are those jars **empty** or **not-empty**?

'If you say they're **empty**, well, that ain't quite right. Because they still got **form**—you can see them, touch them. They still got **smell**—you can smell the yogurt that used to be in there. They still got **taste**—you can taste the residue. So they ain't completely empty.

'But if you say they're **not-empty**, that ain't quite right either. Because there ain't no actual water or wine or yogurt in there no more. The substance is gone.

'So what are they? Empty or not-empty?

'**Both**. And **neither**. They're beyond that simple yes-or-no, this-or-that kind of thinking.

'Liberation is the same way.

'If you say liberation is **empty**, well, then what about permanence, bliss, self, purity? If it's just empty—just nothing—then who experiences those perfections?

'But if you say liberation is **not-empty**, well, then what about all the suffering, all the afflictions, all the mess of saṃsāra? If liberation's not empty of that stuff, then it ain't liberation.

'So liberation is **both** empty and not-empty. And you can't pin it down to just one or the other.

### What Liberation is Empty Of

'When I say liberation is **empty**, I mean it's empty of:

- The twenty-five realms of existence
- All afflictions
- All suffering
- All characteristics
- All conditioned things

'Like that jar with no yogurt in it—it's **empty** of yogurt.

---

### What Liberation is Not-Empty Of

'When I say liberation is **not-empty**, I mean it's not-empty of:

- **Permanence** (it don't fade, don't change, don't die)
- **Bliss** (it's joyful, peaceful, happy)
- **Self** (it's got true nature, true being)
- **Purity** (it's clean, unstained, perfect)

'These qualities are **immovable**, **unchanging**, **eternal**.

'Like that jar—even when it's empty of yogurt, it's still got form, smell, taste, touch. It's **not-empty** of those qualities.

### The Difference Between the Jar and Liberation

'Now, here's the thing: That jar can break. You drop it, it shatters. It's fragile.

'But liberation? **Liberation can't be broken**. Liberation can't be destroyed. Liberation is **eternal**.

'And that unbreakable, indestructible liberation—**that's** the Tathāgata.'

## THE ATMOSPHERE

**The Moan:**  
The moan here is the sound of **confusion**—the confusion of trying to understand something that's beyond simple categories. It's the mind asking, 'Is it empty or not-empty? Is it something or nothing? Is it real or is it void?' It's the moan of wanting a simple answer, a clear yes-or-no, and not getting one. It's the moan of being stretched beyond binary thinking, beyond either-or, into the realm of **both-and** and **neither-nor**.

**The Turnaround:**  
The turnaround is the **jar analogy**. It's the Lord saying, 'Look, you already understand this. You know a jar can be empty of yogurt but not-empty of form and smell. You know some things are **both** and **neither**. Liberation is like that.' The turnaround is realizing: **Ultimate reality is paradoxical. It's beyond simple categories. It's empty of suffering but not-empty of perfection. And that's okay. You don't gotta pin it down. You just gotta experience it.**

**The Sound:**  
This should be read like a **teaching moment**—patient, clear, using a simple, everyday example (jars) to explain a profound truth. The Lord's voice should be gentle but firm: 'Listen, this is how it is. It's both. It's neither. Don't try to force it into a box.' The listing of what liberation is empty of and not-empty of should be rhythmic, deliberate, letting each item land. This is **deep teaching** made **accessible**.

## Key Terms (Endnotes for Learners)

**Empty-Not-Empty (空不空)**  
This is one of the most important teachings in the Nirvana Sutra. Let me break it down:

**Liberation is EMPTY of:**
- The 25 realms of existence (all the places you can be reborn in saṃsāra)
- All afflictions (lust, anger, delusion, greed, jealousy, pride)
- All suffering (pain, sorrow, dissatisfaction)
- All conditioned things (everything that's made, that arises and ceases)

**Liberation is NOT-EMPTY of:**
- **Permanence** (it's eternal, it don't fade)
- **Bliss** (it's joyful, peaceful, happy)
- **Self** (it's got true nature, true being—not the ego-self, but the Buddha-nature self)
- **Purity** (it's clean, unstained, perfect)

So liberation is **both** empty and not-empty. It's empty of the bad stuff, not-empty of the good stuff. It's a paradox. It's beyond simple yes-or-no thinking.

**The Four Perfections (常樂我淨)**  
These are called the **Four Perfections** or the **Four Inversions**:

1. **Permanence (常)** - Liberation is eternal, unchanging, indestructible
2. **Bliss (樂)** - Liberation is joyful, peaceful, happy
3. **Self (我)** - Liberation has true nature, true being (Buddha-nature)
4. **Purity (淨)** - Liberation is clean, unstained, perfect

Now, here's the thing: Early Buddhism taught the **opposite** of these—the Four Marks:
1. **Impermanence** - Everything changes
2. **Suffering** - Everything involves dissatisfaction
3. **No-self** - There's no permanent ego
4. **Impurity** - The body is impure

So what's going on? Is the Buddha contradicting Himself?

No. Here's the deal:

- The **Four Marks** (impermanence, suffering, no-self, impurity) describe **saṃsāra**—the cycle of birth and death, the conditioned world. And they're **true**. Everything in saṃsāra is impermanent, involves suffering, has no permanent self, is impure.

- The **Four Perfections** (permanence, bliss, self, purity) describe **nirvāṇa**—liberation, the unconditioned reality, the Buddha-nature. And they're **true**. Nirvāṇa is permanent, blissful, has true self (Buddha-nature), is pure.

So both teachings are true. They're just describing **different things**. The Four Marks describe what you're leaving behind. The Four Perfections describe what you're going toward.

**The Vessel Analogy**  
This is a beautiful, simple analogy. A jar that used to hold yogurt:
- Is **empty** (no yogurt in it)
- Is **not-empty** (still has form, smell, taste)
- Can't be simply called "empty" or "not-empty"—it's **both**

Same with liberation:
- Is **empty** (no suffering, no afflictions)
- Is **not-empty** (has permanence, bliss, self, purity)
- Can't be simply called "empty" or "not-empty"—it's **both**

The difference? The jar can break. Liberation can't. Liberation is **eternal**.

## Lotus Sutra Connections

### The Bluesman's Take

This teaching connects to **Lotus Sutra Chapter 16**—the eternal Buddha.

**The Eternal Buddha (Lotus Chapter 16)**

When the Lord says liberation is **not-empty** of **permanence**, He's talking about the same truth as Lotus Chapter 16:

> 'Since I attained Buddhahood, an extremely long time has passed. My lifespan is an immeasurable number of kalpas, and during all that time I have constantly abided here without ever entering extinction.'

The Buddha is **permanent**. The Dharma-body is **eternal**. Nirvāṇa ain't annihilation—it's **fullness**. It's **permanence**. It's **bliss**. It's **purity**.

So when the Nirvana Sutra says liberation is 'not-empty' of the Four Perfections, it's saying the same thing as the Lotus Sutra: **The Buddha is eternal. Liberation is real. It's not just the absence of suffering—it's the presence of perfection.**
