## "Cunda's Song of Joy and Sorrow"

*After the whole assembly praised him and begged him to ask the Lord to stay, Cunda stood up—joy flooding through him like a man whose dead parents just came back to life—and he sang this song:*

---

### Verse 1: "I Got Lucky"

**Blessed am I!** I got what I needed—  
I was born human, not some animal or ghost.

I'm cleaning out the greed, the anger, the hate—  
Never going back to them three hells below.

**Blessed am I!** Like I found buried treasure—  
Met the Lord, the one who tames wild hearts.

Now I ain't scared of coming back as a dog,  
'Cause I met the Teacher, the one who sets you free.

The Buddha's like that flower that blooms once in three thousand years—  
Meeting Him and believing? **That's the hardest thing there is.**

---

### Verse 2: "Planting Seeds"

But I met Him, and I planted good seeds in my heart—  
Never going back to that hungry ghost life, always wanting, never full.

And I'm cutting down my pride, my jealousy—  
All them demons inside that keep you fighting.

A mustard seed hitting the point of a needle—  
**That's how rare it is for a Buddha to show up.**

But through giving, through this offering I made,  
I'm crossing over—past human life, past heaven, past all of it.

---

### Verse 3: "The Lotus in the Mud"

The Buddha ain't stained by this dirty world—  
Like a lotus flower growing in muddy water, staying clean.

He cut the root of even the highest meditation—  
Crossed over that river of birth and death for good.

Being born human? **Rare.**  
Meeting a Buddha? **Even rarer.**

It's like a blind turtle in the ocean,  
Coming up for air once every hundred years,  
And his head going right through a floating piece of wood with a hole in it.

**That's how rare this is.**

---

### Verse 4: "What I'm Asking For"

This food I'm offering today—  
I ain't asking for no small reward.

I want the **highest prize**:  
Breaking every chain, every bond, every fetter that ties me down.

I ain't asking for heaven.  
I ain't asking to come back as a rich man.  
Even if I got that, **I wouldn't want it.**

---

### Verse 5: "The Stinking Tree Blooms Sweet"

The Lord taking my offering—  
My joy's got no limit, no measure.

It's like this: There's a tree called eranda—smells terrible, like death.  
But when sandalwood grows next to it, that stinking tree starts smelling sweet.

**I'm that stinking tree.**  
**The Lord's the sandalwood.**

He took my offering, and now I smell like heaven.  
**That's why I'm so happy.**

---

### Verse 6: "Right Now, Right Here"

I'm getting my reward **right now**—not in some future life.  
The gods—Indra, Brahma, all of them—they coming down to honor **me**.

But the whole world's crying,  
Faces swollen from weeping,  
'Cause they know the Lord's about to leave.

They shouting out loud:  
**"The world's gonna be without a tamer!**  
**Without a teacher!**  
**Without the one who shows us the way!"**

---

### Verse 7: "Don't Leave Us"

Lord, don't abandon us.  
Treat us like your only child—  
The one you'd give everything for.

You sitting there in the assembly,  
Teaching the highest truth,  
Like Mount Sumeru standing in the ocean—  
Unshakeable, unmovable, **solid**.

---

### Verse 8: "You're Our Light"

Your wisdom cuts through our ignorance—  
That darkness we been living in—  
Like clouds rising up in the hot sky, bringing cool rain.

You remove all our troubles, all our suffering—  
Like the sun coming up, burning off the fog,  
Light shining everywhere.

---

### Verse 9: "We're Drowning"

Look at us, Lord.  
We crying, our faces swollen from tears.  
We drowning in the river of birth and death,  
The current pulling us under,  
The suffering-water sweeping us away.

---

### Verse 10: "Please Stay" (The Final Plea)

**So please, Lord—**  
**Build up our faith.**  
**Help us believe.**

**To end this suffering,**  
**To cut this cycle of birth and death,**  
**Stay with us a while longer.**

**Don't go yet.**

---

## THE ATMOSPHERE

**The Moan:** Cunda's joy is real—he's been blessed, perfected, honored by gods. But underneath it all is the **terror** of losing the Lord. The whole world's crying. People drowning in suffering. The desperate plea: "Don't leave us."

**The Turnaround:** The turnaround is **partial**—Cunda's been saved (he's like the stinking tree that now smells sweet), but the world's still drowning. The victory's personal, but the struggle's universal. That's the blues tension: **I got mine, but what about everybody else?**

**The Sound:** This should be sung slow, with feeling. The joy parts (Verses 1-6) should lift up, but Verses 7-10 should get heavy, mournful. By the end, you're begging. It's a prayer set to music.

## Key Terms (Endnotes for Learners)

**Udumbara Flower (優曇花)**  
A legendary flower that blooms once every 3,000 years—only when a Buddha appears in the world. It's the symbol of **extreme rarity**. Meeting a Buddha is that rare. Being there for His final teaching? Even rarer.

**Three Evil Paths (三惡道)**  
The three worst places you can be reborn: **hell** (extreme suffering), **hungry ghost realm** (always wanting, never satisfied), and **animal realm** (ignorance, instinct). Meeting the Buddha helps you escape these.

**Asuras (阿修羅)**  
Jealous gods, titans, demigods. They got power but they're always fighting, always envious. They're better off than the three evil paths, but still trapped in suffering. The dharma helps you transcend even this.

**Eranda and Sandalwood (伊蘭 & 栴檀)**  
The eranda tree **stinks**—smells like death. But when sandalwood grows next to it, the eranda starts smelling sweet. Cunda's saying: "I'm that stinking tree (ordinary being), but the Lord's the sandalwood. His presence makes me fragrant (enlightened)." It's transformation through proximity to the holy.

**The Blind Turtle (盲龜)**  
Famous Buddhist parable: A blind turtle lives at the bottom of the ocean. Once every hundred years, it surfaces. Somewhere on the ocean floats a wooden yoke with a hole in it. The chance of that turtle's head going through that hole when it surfaces? **That's how rare human birth is.** And meeting a Buddha? Even rarer.

## Lotus Sutra Connections

### The Bluesman's Take

Cunda's song connects to multiple Lotus Sutra teachings:

**"Rare as the Udumbara Flower"** - This exact image appears in **Lotus Chapter 27**: Meeting a Buddha is as rare as the udumbara flower blooming (once in 3,000 years).

**"The Blind Turtle" parable** - Also found in various Buddhist texts, emphasizing the extreme rarity of human birth and encountering dharma. The Lotus Sutra uses similar imagery to stress urgency in practice.

**"The Stinking Tree Made Sweet"** (Eranda/Sandalwood) - This transformation metaphor parallels **Lotus Chapter 2's** teaching that all beings can become Buddhas. The foul-smelling tree (ordinary being) becomes fragrant (enlightened) through proximity to the Buddha.

**"I Don't Want Heaven"** - Cunda's rejection of heavenly rebirth in favor of supreme enlightenment echoes **Lotus Chapter 3** where the children reject the toys (lesser vehicles) once they see the great white ox cart (One Vehicle/Buddhahood).

**"We're Drowning"** - The image of beings drowning in suffering's water directly parallels **Lotus Chapter 3's** burning house and **Chapter 7's** dangerous path, showing saṃsāra as a place of urgent peril requiring the Buddha's rescue.
