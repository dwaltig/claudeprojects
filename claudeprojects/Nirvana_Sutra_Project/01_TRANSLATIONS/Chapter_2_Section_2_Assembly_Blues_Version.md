## "The Whole Church Stands Up"

### Part 1: The People Speak

Now when everybody in that assembly heard the Lord say He was gonna take Cunda's last meal—that He was gonna receive this poor blacksmith's offering—the whole place **erupted**.

People jumping up, shouting, crying tears of joy. And they all started praising Cunda with one voice, like a congregation that just heard good news:

---

**"Well done, brother! Well done!**

**Cunda—your name ain't no accident.**

See, 'Cunda' means 'the one who understands the deep things.' And today you proved it. You living up to your name, son. Your name ain't empty—it's **real**. You got the understanding to match it.

And look at you now—famous in this world, blessed in this life. Your virtue's complete. Your prayers answered.

**What a wonder you are, Cunda!**

You was born human—just a regular man like the rest of us. But you got something most folks never get, something **harder to find than gold**.

Listen: A Buddha showing up in this world—that's like that flower that only blooms once every three thousand years. **Rare as rare gets.**

And meeting that Buddha, believing in Him, hearing the truth from His mouth—that's even harder.

But to be there when the Buddha's about to leave, to give Him that last meal, to be the one who does that final service—**brother, that's the hardest thing of all**.

---

**Homage to you, Cunda. Homage to you.**

You perfected generosity today. You completed the work of giving.

You like the **full moon in autumn**—the clearest, brightest moon of the year. Fifteenth night, when it's perfectly round, perfectly bright, no clouds blocking it, and everybody—**everybody**—looks up and sees it shining.

That's you, Cunda. We all looking up at you now. The Buddha took your offering, and it made you **complete**. Made you shine like that moon.

**Homage to you, Cunda.**

You like the moon at its fullest, and we can't help but look up.

**Homage to you, Cunda.**

You got a human body, sure. But your heart—your heart's like the Buddha's heart.

You a true son of the Buddha now, Cunda. Just like Rāhula, the Lord's own boy. **No difference between you and him. None at all.**"

---

### Part 2: The People Sing

And then the whole assembly—they broke into song. This is what they sang to Cunda:

---

*"You was born down here with us,*  
*But you done rose higher than heaven.*

*We all bowing down now,*  
*Begging you, pleading with you:*

*The greatest man who ever walked—*  
*He's about to leave us.*

*Have mercy on us, Cunda.*  
*Go ask Him quick—*

*Ask Him to stay a while longer,*  
*Help all these suffering people,*

*Teach us that wisdom,*  
*That truth that never dies.*

*If you don't ask Him, Cunda,*  
*We ain't gonna make it.*

*So please, for our sake,*  
*Go bow down and beg the Lord to stay."*

---

### Part 3: Cunda's Joy

Now when Cunda heard all this—the whole assembly praising him, calling him blessed, comparing him to the full moon, saying he was like the Buddha's own son—

His joy was **overwhelming**.

It was like a man whose mama and daddy died sudden, and he's standing there at the grave, heart broken clean in two—and then, **miracle of miracles**, they sit up. They alive again. They come back.

**That's how happy Cunda was.**

He stood up, bowed down to the Lord again, and he started singing his own song:

---

## THE ATMOSPHERE

**The Moan:** The assembly's desperate fear—"If you don't ask Him, we ain't gonna make it." They know they're about to lose everything.

**The Turnaround:** But first comes the **celebration**—Cunda's been blessed, perfected, made complete. The poor blacksmith is now shining like the full moon. Before the sorrow comes the joy. That's the blues way—you gotta celebrate the victory even when you know the hard times are coming.

**The Sound:** This should sound like a church service. The congregation standing up, shouting "Amen!" The call-and-response. The verse breaking into song. And then Cunda's overwhelming joy—like resurrection morning.

## Key Terms (Endnotes for Learners)

**Dragon-Elephant Bodhisattvas (龍象菩薩)**  
The mighty ones. Great bodhisattvas who combine the **spiritual power of dragons** (heaven, wisdom, transformation) with the **unshakeable strength of elephants** (earth, steadfastness, can't be moved). These are the spiritual warriors, the elders, the pillars of the sangha. Mañjuśrī is one of them.

**Perfection of Giving (檀波羅蜜)**  
Generosity so complete it carries you across to liberation. When the assembly says Cunda "perfected giving," they mean his offering wasn't just generous—it was **complete**, with no ego, no strings attached. The act itself made him whole.

**Full Moon (滿月)**  
The assembly compares Cunda to the full autumn moon—perfectly round, perfectly bright, no clouds blocking it. Everyone looks up at it. That's what perfection looks like: **complete, radiant, worthy of reverence**. Cunda's offering made him shine like that.

**Rāhula (羅睺羅)**  
The Buddha's biological son. When the assembly says Cunda is "like Rāhula, no difference," they're saying he's become a **true son of the Buddha**—not by blood, but by dharma. The highest honor.

## Lotus Sutra Connections

### The Bluesman's Take

This section echoes **Lotus Sutra Chapter 10 (The Teacher of the Dharma)** and **Chapter 23 (The Bodhisattva Medicine King)**:

**The Assembly's Praise of Cunda** parallels how the Lotus Sutra honors those who make offerings to the dharma. Just as Cunda is compared to the full moon and called "Buddha's son like Rāhula," the Lotus teaches that anyone who honors the sutra becomes worthy of reverence.

**"You like the moon fully abundant"** - This image of perfection through offering appears throughout the Lotus Sutra's teachings on merit and the power of devotion.

**The Assembly's Desperate Plea** ("If you don't ask Him, we ain't gonna make it") connects to the Lotus Sutra's teaching that beings need the Buddha's presence and teaching to find liberation.
