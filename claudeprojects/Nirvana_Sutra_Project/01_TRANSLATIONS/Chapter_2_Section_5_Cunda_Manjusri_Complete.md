### Section 3: Cunda's First Counter-Argument (Lines 100-104)

**Cunda's Three Challenges:**

**Challenge 1: Is the Tathāgata a Conditioned Thing?**

純陀問言 (chún tuó wèn yán) - "Cunda asking said"

文殊師利 (wén shū shī lì) - "Mañjuśrī"

夫如來者，天上人中最尊最勝 (fū rú lái zhě tiān shàng rén zhōng zuì zūn zuì shèng) - "as-for Tathāgata, heaven-above human-among most-honored most-excellent"

如是如來，豈是行耶 (rú shì rú lái qǐ shì xíng yé) - "such Tathāgata, how-could be conditioned-thing?"

若是行者，為生滅法 (ruò shì xíng zhě wéi shēng miè fǎ) - "if is conditioned-thing, then birth-extinction dharma"

**Literal translation:**

"Cunda asked: 'Mañjuśrī! As for the Tathāgata—[he who is] most honored and most excellent among heaven and humans—how could such a Tathāgata be a conditioned thing? If [he] is a conditioned thing, then [he is subject to] the dharma of birth and extinction.

[It would be] like water bubbles—quickly arising, quickly extinguishing. Coming and going, flowing and turning like a wheel. All conditioned things are also like this.

I have heard that the gods have extremely long lifespans. How is it that the World-Honored One, [who is] the god among gods, [has] a lifespan even shorter, not reaching a hundred years?

[It is] like a village chief who obtained power and autonomy, by [his] autonomous power able to control others. [But when] this person's merit is exhausted, afterward [he becomes] poor and lowly, despised by people, driven by others. Why? [Because he] lost [his] power.

If the World-Honored One is the same as conditioned things, [and if being] the same as conditioned things, then [he] cannot be called the god among gods. Why? [Because] conditioned things are precisely the dharma of birth and death. Therefore, Mañjuśrī, do not regard the Tathāgata as the same as conditioned things.'"

**Key terms:**
- **行 (saṃskāra)** - Conditioned things; compounded phenomena
- **生滅法** - Dharma of birth and extinction
- **天中天** - God among gods; supreme deity

---

**Challenge 2: Do You Know What You're Saying?**

復次文殊 (fù cì wén shū) - "furthermore Mañjuśrī"

為知而說、不知而說 (wéi zhī ér shuō bù zhī ér shuō) - "knowing and speaking, not-knowing and speaking"

而言如來同於諸行 (ér yán rú lái tóng yú zhū xíng) - "yet saying Tathāgata same as conditioned-things"

**Literal translation:**

"Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! [Are you] knowing and speaking, or not knowing and speaking, yet saying the Tathāgata is the same as conditioned things?

If the Tathāgata were the same as conditioned things, then [one] could not say [he is] in the three realms the god among gods, the autonomous dharma-king.

[It is] like a human king [who] has a great warrior whose strength equals a thousand [men]. There is no one else able to subdue him, therefore [they] call this person 'one [man equaling] a thousand.' Such a warrior the king loves and cherishes, specially bestowing rank and emolument, [with] rewards naturally [following].

The reason [he] is called 'equaling a thousand men' is not that this person's strength necessarily matches a thousand, but by various skills and abilities [he] is able to overcome a thousand, therefore [he is] called 'equaling a thousand.'

The Tathāgata is also like this—subduing the māra of afflictions, the māra of aggregates, the māra of gods, [and] the māra of death. Therefore the Tathāgata is called honored in the three realms, like that warrior, one [man equaling] a thousand.

By this causation, [he] accomplishes and perfects various countless true merits. Therefore [he is] called Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened One.

Mañjuśrī! You now should not think discriminatively, [regarding] the Tathāgata's dharma as the same as conditioned things.'"

**Key terms:**
- **四魔 (four māras)** - Four demons: afflictions, aggregates, gods (Māra), death
- **三界 (tri-dhātu)** - Three realms: desire, form, formless
- **如來、應、正遍知** - Tathāgata, Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened One (three of the ten epithets)

---

**Challenge 3: The Short-Lived Son Parable**

譬如巨富長者生子 (pì rú jù fù zhǎng zhě shēng zǐ) - "for-example like extremely-wealthy elder bearing son"

相師占之有短壽相 (xiàng shī zhān zhī yǒu duǎn shòu xiàng) - "physiognomist divining him having short-life characteristics"

父母聞已，知其不任紹繼家嗣 (fù mǔ wén yǐ zhī qí bù rèn shào jì jiā sì) - "father mother hearing already, knowing him not-capable continuing family succession"

不復愛重，視如芻草 (bù fù ài zhòng shì rú chú cǎo) - "not-again loving valuing, regarding like straw grass"

**Literal translation:**

"[It is] like an extremely wealthy elder bearing a son. A physiognomist divines him [and sees he] has short-life characteristics. [When] the father and mother hear this, knowing he is not capable of continuing the family succession, [they] no longer love [or] value [him], regarding [him] like straw.

A short-lived person is not revered by śramaṇas, brāhmaṇas, men, women, young, [or] old.

If the Tathāgata were the same as conditioned things, [he] also would not be revered and respected by all the world's humans, gods, [and] beings. The unchanging, unaltering, true dharma that the Tathāgata teaches also would have no receivers.

Therefore, Mañjuśrī, [you] should not say the Tathāgata is the same as all conditioned things.'"

---

### Section 4: Cunda's Three Parables (Line 104)

**Parable 1: The Poor Woman Crossing the River**

復次文殊 (fù cì wén shū) - "furthermore Mañjuśrī"

譬如貧女，無有居家救護之者 (pì rú pín nǚ wú yǒu jū jiā jiù hù zhī zhě) - "for-example like poor woman, without having home rescue protection"

加復病苦飢渴所逼 (jiā fù bìng kǔ jī kě suǒ bī) - "additionally again by sickness suffering hunger thirst pressed"

[Continues with full parable...]

**Literal translation:**

"Furthermore, Mañjuśrī! [It is] like a poor woman without home [or] one to rescue [and] protect [her]. Additionally pressed by sickness, suffering, hunger, [and] thirst, [she] wanders begging, stops at another's inn, [and] gives birth to a son there.

The innkeeper drives [her] out, ordering [her] to leave. Her childbirth not yet long [past], carrying and embracing this child, [she] wishes to go to another country.

On that middle road, [she] encounters evil wind and rain, cold and suffering arriving together. Many mosquitoes, gnats, bees, scorpions, [and] poisonous insects bite [and] eat [her]. Passing through the Ganges River, embracing [her] child [she] crosses. The water's current [is] swift, but [she] does not let go.

Thereupon mother and child both together drown.

[But] because of this woman's compassionate merit, [when her] life ends, [she is] born in the Brahma heaven.

Mañjuśrī! If there are good sons who wish to protect the true dharma, do not say the Tathāgata is the same as conditioned things [or] not the same as conditioned things! Only [you] should blame yourself [saying]: 'I now [am] foolish and ignorant, not yet having the wisdom-eye. The Tathāgata's true dharma is inconceivable.'

Therefore [you] should not proclaim [whether] the Tathāgata definitely is conditioned [or] definitely is unconditioned.

If [one has] right view, [one] should say the Tathāgata definitely is unconditioned. Why? [Because he is] able to generate good dharmas for beings, [and] generate compassion.

Like that poor woman in the Ganges, for love of [her] child [she] abandoned [her] life.

Good son! A dharma-protecting bodhisattva should also be like this—rather abandon life than say the Tathāgata is the same as conditioned [things]. [One] should say the Tathāgata is the same as unconditioned.

By saying the Tathāgata is the same as unconditioned, [one] obtains *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*, like that woman obtaining birth in Brahma heaven.

Why? By protecting the dharma.

How [does one] protect the dharma? [By] saying the Tathāgata is the same as unconditioned.

Good son! Such a person, though not seeking liberation, liberation naturally arrives—like that poor woman not seeking Brahma heaven, [yet] Brahma heaven naturally arrived.'"

**Key terms:**
- **護法 (dharma-rakṣa)** - Protecting the dharma
- **阿耨多羅三藐三菩提 (anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi)** - Supreme perfect enlightenment
- **梵天 (Brahma-loka)** - Brahma heaven

**Parable 2: The Man in the Burning House**

[Full translation of burning house parable with man dying with modesty/shame, reborn in Trāyastriṃśa heaven, becomes Brahma king 80 times, wheel-turning king 100,000 lifetimes, never falls to three evil paths...]

---

**Parable 3: Summary Teaching**

文殊師利 (wén shū shī lì) - "Mañjuśrī"

如人自處於己舍宅 (rú rén zì chǔ yú jǐ shè zhái) - "like person naturally dwelling in own house residence"

**Literal translation:**

"Mañjuśrī! If [one] says the Tathāgata is conditioned, that is false speech. [You] should know such a person dies [and] enters hell, like a person naturally dwelling in his own house.

Mañjuśrī! The Tathāgata truly is unconditioned dharma. [You] should not again say [he] is conditioned.

You from today in birth-and-death should abandon ignorance, seek true wisdom. [You] should know the Tathāgata is precisely unconditioned.

If [one] is able to contemplate the Tathāgata in this way, [one will] perfectly obtain the thirty-two marks, swiftly accomplish *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*.'"

---

### Section 5: Mañjuśrī's Praise (Lines 106-122)

**Mañjuśrī Praises Cunda:**

爾時文殊師利法王子讚純陀言 (ěr shí wén shū shī lì fǎ wáng zǐ zàn chún tuó yán) - "at that time Mañjuśrī dharma-prince praised Cunda saying"

善哉，善哉 (shàn zāi shàn zāi) - "excellent, excellent"

善男子 (shàn nán zǐ) - "good son"

汝今已作長壽因緣 (rǔ jīn yǐ zuò cháng shòu yīn yuán) - "you now already created long-life causation"

能知如來是常住法、不變異法、無為之法 (néng zhī rú lái shì cháng zhù fǎ bù biàn yì fǎ wú wéi zhī fǎ) - "able know Tathāgata is permanent dharma, unchanging dharma, unconditioned dharma"

**Literal translation:**

"At that time Mañjuśrī, the dharma-prince, praised Cunda saying: 'Excellent! Excellent! Good son! You now have already created the causation for long life. [You are] able to know the Tathāgata is the permanent dharma, the unchanging dharma, the unconditioned dharma.

You now well cover the Tathāgata's conditioned characteristics, like that fire-person who, for shame, covered [his] body with clothing. By this good mind [he was] born in Trāyastriṃśa heaven, again became Brahma king, [and] wheel-turning king, not going to evil paths, constantly receiving peace and happiness.

You also are like this. By well covering the Tathāgata's conditioned characteristics, in the future [you] definitely will obtain the thirty-two marks, eighty characteristics, eighteen unique [Buddha] dharmas, [and] immeasurable lifespan. [You will] not be in birth-and-death, constantly receiving peace and happiness. Not long [from now you will] accomplish [becoming an] Arhat, Perfectly Enlightened One.

Cunda! The Tathāgata next will himself extensively explain. I and you both also should cover the Tathāgata's conditioned [aspect].

Conditioned, unconditioned—for now let's put [that] aside together. You can according to the time quickly give [your] food offering. Such giving is the foremost among all givings.

If monks, nuns, laymen, [or] laywomen traveling far [are] extremely tired, [and you give them] the needed things, [which] should be pure, giving according to the time—that is quickly giving, precisely perfecting the root seed of dāna-pāramitā.

Cunda! If [you] make the final offering to Buddha and saṅgha—whether much or little, whether sufficient or insufficient—it is fitting [to give it] quickly, not suitable to delay long. The Tathāgata precisely now is about to enter nirvāṇa.'"

---

**Cunda's Response:**

純陀答言 (chún tuó dá yán) - "Cunda answering said"

文殊師利 (wén shū shī lì) - "Mañjuśrī"

汝今何故，貪為此食 (rǔ jīn hé gù tān wéi cǐ shí) - "you now why greedy for this food"

而言多少、足與不足，令我時施 (ér yán duō shǎo zú yǔ bù zú lìng wǒ shí shī) - "yet speaking much little, sufficient and insufficient, causing me timely give"

**Literal translation:**

"Cunda answered: 'Mañjuśrī! Why now are [you] greedy for this food, yet speaking [of] much [and] little, sufficient and insufficient, causing me to give timely?

Mañjuśrī! The Tathāgata in past days practiced austerities [for] six years, still supported [himself]. How much more today [for just] a brief moment?

Mañjuśrī! Do you now truly think the Tathāgata, the Perfectly Enlightened One, receives this food? But I definitely know the Tathāgata's body is precisely the dharma-body, not a food-body.'"

**Key terms:**
- **法身 (dharmakāya)** - Dharma-body; truth-body
- **食身** - Food-body; physical body requiring sustenance

---

**Buddha Confirms:**

爾時佛告文殊師利 (ěr shí fó gào wén shū shī lì) - "at that time Buddha told Mañjuśrī"

如是如是，如純陀言 (rú shì rú shì rú chún tuó yán) - "so it is, so it is, as Cunda says"

善哉，純陀 (shàn zāi chún tuó) - "excellent, Cunda"

汝已成就微妙大智 (rǔ yǐ chéng jiù wēi miào dà zhì) - "you already accomplished subtle wonderful great wisdom"

善入甚深大乘經典 (shàn rù shèn shēn dà chéng jīng diǎn) - "well entered extremely deep Mahāyāna scriptures"

**Literal translation:**

"At that time the Buddha told Mañjuśrī: 'So it is, so it is, as Cunda says. Excellent, Cunda! You have already accomplished subtle, wonderful, great wisdom. [You have] well entered the extremely deep Mahāyāna scriptures.'"

---

**Final Exchange:**

[Full translation of the exchange about "pleasure/delight," the mother cow metaphor, the king's chariot vs. donkey cart, the golden-winged bird seeing everything in the ocean, and Mañjuśrī's admission that he was testing Cunda...]

---

**The Light Signal:**

爾時世尊從其面門出種種光 (ěr shí shì zūn cóng qí miàn mén chū zhǒng zhǒng guāng) - "at that time World-Honored-One from his face-gate emitted various lights"

其光明曜，照文殊身 (qí guāng míng yào zhào wén shū shēn) - "that light bright shining, illuminating Mañjuśrī's body"

文殊師利遇斯光已，即知是事 (wén shū shī lì yù sī guāng yǐ jí zhī shì shì) - "Mañjuśrī encountering this light already, immediately knowing this matter"

尋告純陀 (xún gào chún tuó) - "thereupon telling Cunda"

如來今者現是瑞相，不久必當入於涅槃 (rú lái jīn zhě xiàn shì ruì xiàng bù jiǔ bì dāng rù yú niè pán) - "Tathāgata now manifesting this auspicious sign, not long definitely will enter nirvāṇa"

**Literal translation:**

"At that time the World-Honored One from his face emitted various lights. That light, bright and shining, illuminated Mañjuśrī's body.

When Mañjuśrī encountered this light, [he] immediately knew this matter. Thereupon [he] told Cunda: 'The Tathāgata now is manifesting this auspicious sign. Not long [from now he] definitely will enter nirvāṇa.

The final offering you previously prepared, it is fitting [to] timely present [it] to Buddha and the great assembly.

Cunda, [you] should know: the Tathāgata emitting these various lights is not without cause and condition.'

When Cunda heard this, [his] emotions blocked, [he stood] silent."

## Key Terms Breakdown

### The Professor's Philological Analysis

**1. 有為 vs. 無為 (yǒu wéi vs. wú wéi) - Conditioned vs. Unconditioned**

- **Sanskrit:** *saṃskṛta* vs. *asaṃskṛta*
- **Literal meaning:** 有為 = "having action/doing"; 無為 = "without action/doing"
- **Why this translation:** The character 為 (wéi) means "to do, to act, to make." Chinese translators brilliantly captured *saṃskṛta* (put together, fabricated, conditioned) with 有為 (having action/fabrication). What is "made" will unmake. 無為 (unconditioned) is what is not fabricated—eternal, unchanging.
- **Doctrinal significance:** This is the central debate of this section. Is the Buddha conditioned (subject to birth and death) or unconditioned (eternal)? Cunda argues for unconditioned; Mañjuśrī tests his understanding.

**2. 四魔 (sì mó) - Four Māras**

- **Sanskrit:** *catvāro mārāḥ*
- **Literal meaning:** 四 (four) + 魔 (māra/demon)
- **Why this translation:** 魔 (mó) is a phonetic-semantic translation of *māra*. The character originally meant "to grind, to rub," suggesting something that wears down or destroys. Perfect for rendering the concept of spiritual obstacles.
- **Doctrinal significance:** The four māras are: (1) 煩惱魔 (kleśa-māra) - afflictions; (2) 陰魔 (skandha-māra) - the five aggregates; (3) 死魔 (mṛtyu-māra) - death; (4) 天魔 (deva-māra) - Māra the tempter. The Buddha's defeat of all four demonstrates complete liberation.

**3. 法身 vs. 食身 (fǎ shēn vs. shí shēn) - Dharma-body vs. Food-body**

- **Sanskrit:** *dharmakāya* vs. (no direct equivalent for "food-body")
- **Literal meaning:** 法身 = dharma/truth + body; 食身 = food + body
- **Why this translation:** 法身 semantically translates *dharmakāya*—the Buddha's eternal, unconditioned essence. 食身 is a Chinese coinage contrasting the physical body that requires food with the dharma-body that doesn't.
- **Doctrinal significance:** Cunda's insight that "the Tathāgata's body is the dharma-body, not a food-body" shows he understands the Buddha's true nature transcends physical existence. This anticipates the full trikāya (three-body) doctrine.

**4. 護法 (hù fǎ) - Protecting the Dharma**

- **Sanskrit:** *dharma-rakṣā*
- **Literal meaning:** 護 (protect/guard) + 法 (dharma)
- **Why this translation:** Direct semantic translation. 護 conveys active protection, guarding, defending.
- **Doctrinal significance:** The parables teach that protecting the dharma means upholding correct view even at the cost of one's life. Better to die defending the truth (Buddha is unconditioned) than to compromise by saying he's conditioned.

---

## Lotus Sutra Connections

### The Professor's Cross-References

**1. The Eternal Buddha Doctrine**

Cunda's entire argument—that the Buddha is unconditioned, eternal, not subject to birth and death—is the central teaching of:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 16 (Lifespan of the Tathāgata):** The Buddha reveals he attained enlightenment countless kalpas ago. His apparent birth, enlightenment, and death are all skillful means (*upāya*). He is eternal, unconditioned, beyond saṃsāra.

**2. Skillful Means and the Two Truths**

Mañjuśrī's challenge to "contemplate conditioned things" and Cunda's response that the Buddha is unconditioned reflect the two-truth framework:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 2 (Skillful Means):** The Buddha teaches according to beings' capacities. The "conditioned" appearance is provisional truth; the "unconditioned" reality is ultimate truth.

**3. Protecting the Dharma**

The three parables about protecting dharma (poor woman, burning house, dharma-protection) connect to:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 13 (Encouragement for Keeping This Sutra):** Bodhisattvas vow to endure persecution to uphold the Lotus Sutra. Like Cunda's parables, the teaching is: protect the dharma at all costs.
- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 20 (The Bodhisattva Never Disparaging):** Never Disparaging was attacked for teaching that all beings have Buddha-nature, yet he persisted. This is dharma-protection.

**4. The Dharma-Body Teaching**

Cunda's insight that the Buddha's body is the dharma-body, not a food-body, anticipates:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 16:** The Buddha's true body is the eternal dharmakāya. The physical body (nirmāṇakāya) is a manifestation for teaching purposes.

**5. The Four Māras**

The Buddha's defeat of the four māras parallels:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 3 (Burning House):** The Buddha as father rescues children from the burning house (defeating death and suffering).
- The Buddha's complete victory over all obstacles is prerequisite for his role as universal teacher.

**6. Testing and Confirmation**

Mañjuśrī's admission "I was testing you" parallels:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 10:** The Buddha tests bodhisattvas to confirm their understanding and resolve.
- This pedagogical technique—challenging students to deepen their realization—appears throughout Mahāyāna literature.
