### The Monks' Praise of Impermanence (Line 189)

**爾時諸比丘聞佛世尊定當涅槃，皆悉憂愁，身毛為豎，涕淚盈目，稽首佛足，遶無量匝，白佛言：「世尊！快說無常、苦、空、無我。」**

- 爾時 (ěr shí) - at that time
- 諸比丘 (zhū bǐqiū) - the bhikṣus
- 聞 (wén) - hearing
- 佛世尊 (fó shìzūn) - Buddha, World-Honored One
- 定當涅槃 (dìng dāng nièpán) - definitely will enter *nirvāṇa*
- 皆悉憂愁 (jiē xī yōuchóu) - all sorrowful
- 身毛為豎 (shēn máo wéi shù) - body hair standing on end
- 涕淚盈目 (tìlèi yíng mù) - tears filling the eyes
- 稽首佛足 (qǐshǒu fó zú) - bowing heads to the Buddha's feet
- 遶無量匝 (rào wúliàng zā) - circumambulating countless times
- 白佛言 (bái fó yán) - addressed the Buddha saying
- 世尊 (shìzūn) - World-Honored One
- 快說 (kuài shuō) - excellently taught
- 無常 (wúcháng) - impermanence
- 苦 (kǔ) - suffering
- 空 (kōng) - emptiness
- 無我 (wúwǒ) - no-self

"At that time the bhikṣus, hearing that the Buddha, World-Honored One, definitely would enter *nirvāṇa*, all became sorrowful, their body hair standing on end, tears filling their eyes. They bowed their heads to the Buddha's feet, circumambulated countless times, and addressed the Buddha saying: 'World-Honored One! You have excellently taught impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and no-self.'"

---

[The monks continue with extensive metaphors praising the teaching of impermanence, comparing it to the elephant's footprint being the largest of all animal tracks, to autumn plowing that removes weeds, etc. They plead for the Buddha to remain and complete their liberation.]

### Buddha's Praise and the Monks' Confession (Lines 191-193)

**爾時世尊讚諸比丘：「善哉，善哉！汝等善能修無我想。」**

"At that time the World-Honored One praised the bhikṣus: 'Excellent, excellent! You all are skillful in cultivating the perception of no-self.'"

**時諸比丘即白佛言：「世尊！我等不但修無我想，亦更修習其餘諸想，所謂苦想、無常想、無我想。」**

"At that time the bhikṣus immediately addressed the Buddha saying: 'World-Honored One! We not only cultivate the perception of no-self, we also further cultivate the other perceptions, namely the perception of suffering, the perception of impermanence, and the perception of no-self.'"

### The Buddha's Revolutionary Teaching: The Four Inversions (Lines 195-197)

**爾時佛告諸比丘：「諦聽，諦聽。汝向所引醉人喻者，但知文字，未達其義。何等為義？如彼醉人，見上日月，實非迴轉，生迴轉想。眾生亦爾，為諸煩惱無明所覆，生顛倒心，我計無我、常計無常、淨計不淨、樂計為苦，以為煩惱之所覆故。雖生此想，不達其義，如彼醉人於非轉處，而生轉想。」**

- 諦聽 (dìtīng) - listen carefully
- 汝向所引 (rǔ xiàng suǒ yǐn) - you previously cited
- 醉人喻 (zuìrén yù) - the metaphor of the drunk person
- 但知文字 (dàn zhī wénzì) - only know the words
- 未達其義 (wèi dá qí yì) - have not reached their meaning
- 何等為義 (héděng wéi yì) - what is the meaning
- 如彼醉人 (rú bǐ zuìrén) - like that drunk person
- 見上日月 (jiàn shàng rìyuè) - seeing the sun and moon above
- 實非迴轉 (shí fēi huízhuǎn) - actually not rotating
- 生迴轉想 (shēng huízhuǎn xiǎng) - generates the perception of rotation
- 眾生亦爾 (zhòngshēng yì ěr) - sentient beings are also thus
- 為諸煩惱無明所覆 (wéi zhū fánnǎo wúmíng suǒ fù) - covered by afflictions and ignorance
- 生顛倒心 (shēng diāndǎo xīn) - generate inverted minds
- 我計無我 (wǒ jì wúwǒ) - [what is] self, they reckon as no-self
- 常計無常 (cháng jì wúcháng) - [what is] permanent, they reckon as impermanent
- 淨計不淨 (jìng jì bùjìng) - [what is] pure, they reckon as impure
- 樂計為苦 (lè jì wéi kǔ) - [what is] bliss, they reckon as suffering

"At that time the Buddha told the bhikṣus: 'Listen carefully, listen carefully. The metaphor of the drunk person you previously cited—you only know the words, you have not reached their meaning. What is the meaning? Like that drunk person seeing the sun and moon above—[they are] actually not rotating, [yet he] generates the perception of rotation. Sentient beings are also thus: covered by afflictions and ignorance, they generate inverted minds. [What is] self, they reckon as no-self; [what is] permanent, they reckon as impermanent; [what is] pure, they reckon as impure; [what is] bliss, they reckon as suffering. Because they are covered by afflictions, although they generate these perceptions, they do not reach their meaning, like that drunk person who, at a non-rotating place, generates the perception of rotation.'"

**「我者即是佛義，常者是法身義，樂者是涅槃義，淨者是法義。」**

- 我者 (wǒzhě) - "self"
- 即是 (jíshì) - precisely is
- 佛義 (fó yì) - the meaning of Buddha
- 常者 (chángzhě) - "permanence"
- 是法身義 (shì fǎshēn yì) - is the meaning of Dharma-body
- 樂者 (lèzhě) - "bliss"
- 是涅槃義 (shì nièpán yì) - is the meaning of *nirvāṇa*
- 淨者 (jìngzhě) - "purity"
- 是法義 (shì fǎ yì) - is the meaning of Dharma

"'Self' precisely is the meaning of Buddha; 'permanence' is the meaning of Dharma-body; 'bliss' is the meaning of *nirvāṇa*; 'purity' is the meaning of Dharma."

**「汝等比丘！云何而言有我想者，憍慢貢高流轉生死？汝等若言，我亦修習無常、苦、無我等想，是三種修，無有實義。我今當說勝三修法，苦者計樂、樂者計苦，是顛倒法。無常計常、常計無常，是顛倒法。無我計我、我計無我，是顛倒法。不淨計淨、淨計不淨，是顛倒法。有如是等四顛倒法，是人不知正修諸法。」**

- 云何而言 (yúnhé ér yán) - how can you say
- 有我想者 (yǒu wǒ xiǎng zhě) - those who have the perception of self
- 憍慢貢高 (jiāomàn gònggāo) - arrogant and haughty
- 流轉生死 (liúzhuǎn shēngsǐ) - transmigrate in birth and death
- 是三種修 (shì sān zhǒng xiū) - these three kinds of cultivation
- 無有實義 (wú yǒu shíyì) - have no real meaning
- 我今當說 (wǒ jīn dāng shuō) - I now shall speak
- 勝三修法 (shèng sān xiū fǎ) - superior three cultivation methods
- 苦者計樂 (kǔzhě jì lè) - [what is] suffering, reckoning as bliss
- 樂者計苦 (lèzhě jì kǔ) - [what is] bliss, reckoning as suffering
- 是顛倒法 (shì diāndǎo fǎ) - this is inverted dharma
- 四顛倒法 (sì diāndǎo fǎ) - four inverted dharmas
- 是人不知 (shì rén bù zhī) - such a person does not know
- 正修諸法 (zhèng xiū zhū fǎ) - correctly cultivating the dharmas

"You bhikṣus! How can you say that those who have the perception of self are arrogant and haughty, transmigrating in birth and death? If you all say, 'We also cultivate the perceptions of impermanence, suffering, and no-self,' these three kinds of cultivation have no real meaning. I now shall speak of the superior three cultivation methods: [What is] suffering, reckoning as bliss; [what is] bliss, reckoning as suffering—this is inverted dharma. [What is] impermanent, reckoning as permanent; [what is] permanent, reckoning as impermanent—this is inverted dharma. [What is] no-self, reckoning as self; [what is] self, reckoning as no-self—this is inverted dharma. [What is] impure, reckoning as pure; [what is] pure, reckoning as impure—this is inverted dharma. Having such four inverted dharmas, such a person does not know how to correctly cultivate the dharmas."

### Worldly vs. Transcendent Permanence, Bliss, Self, and Purity (Line 197)

**「汝諸比丘，於苦法中生於樂想，於無常中生於常想，於無我中生於我想，於不淨中生於淨想。世間亦有常樂我淨，出世亦有常樂我淨。世間法者有字無義，出世間者有字有義。何以故？世間之法有四顛倒，故不知義。所以者何？有想顛倒、心倒、見倒。以三倒故，世間之人，樂中見苦、常見無常、我見無我、淨見不淨，是名顛倒。以顛倒故，世間知字而不知義。」**

- 於苦法中 (yú kǔfǎ zhōng) - in suffering dharmas
- 生於樂想 (shēng yú lè xiǎng) - generate the perception of bliss
- 世間亦有 (shìjiān yì yǒu) - the worldly also has
- 常樂我淨 (cháng lè wǒ jìng) - permanence, bliss, self, purity
- 出世亦有 (chūshì yì yǒu) - the transcendent also has
- 常樂我淨 (cháng lè wǒ jìng) - permanence, bliss, self, purity
- 世間法者 (shìjiān fǎ zhě) - worldly dharmas
- 有字無義 (yǒu zì wú yì) - have the words but not the meaning
- 出世間者 (chūshìjiān zhě) - transcendent [dharmas]
- 有字有義 (yǒu zì yǒu yì) - have the words and the meaning
- 想顛倒 (xiǎng diāndǎo) - inverted perception
- 心倒 (xīn dǎo) - inverted mind
- 見倒 (jiàn dǎo) - inverted view
- 以三倒故 (yǐ sān dǎo gù) - because of the three inversions

"You bhikṣus, in suffering dharmas generate the perception of bliss; in impermanence generate the perception of permanence; in no-self generate the perception of self; in impurity generate the perception of purity. The worldly also has permanence, bliss, self, and purity; the transcendent also has permanence, bliss, self, and purity. Worldly dharmas have the words but not the meaning; transcendent [dharmas] have the words and the meaning. Why? Because worldly dharmas have the four inversions, therefore they do not know the meaning. How so? There are inverted perception, inverted mind, and inverted view. Because of the three inversions, worldly people in bliss see suffering, in permanence see impermanence, in self see no-self, in purity see impurity—this is called inversion. Because of inversion, the worldly know the words but do not know the meaning."

**「何等為義？無我者名為生死，我者名為如來；無常者聲聞緣覺，常者如來法身；苦者一切外道，樂者即是涅槃；不淨者即有為法，淨者諸佛菩薩所有正法；是名不顛倒。以不倒故，知字知義。若欲遠離四顛倒者，應知如是常、樂、我、淨。」**

- 無我者 (wúwǒ zhě) - "no-self"
- 名為生死 (míngwéi shēngsǐ) - is called *saṃsāra*
- 我者 (wǒzhě) - "self"
- 名為如來 (míngwéi rúlái) - is called Tathāgata
- 無常者 (wúcháng zhě) - "impermanence"
- 聲聞緣覺 (shēngwén yuánjué) - śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas
- 常者 (chángzhě) - "permanence"
- 如來法身 (rúlái fǎshēn) - Tathāgata's Dharma-body
- 苦者 (kǔzhě) - "suffering"
- 一切外道 (yīqiè wàidào) - all non-Buddhists
- 樂者 (lèzhě) - "bliss"
- 即是涅槃 (jíshì nièpán) - precisely is *nirvāṇa*
- 不淨者 (bùjìng zhě) - "impurity"
- 即有為法 (jí yǒuwéi fǎ) - precisely is conditioned dharmas
- 淨者 (jìngzhě) - "purity"
- 諸佛菩薩所有正法 (zhū fó púsà suǒyǒu zhèngfǎ) - the true Dharma possessed by Buddhas and Bodhisattvas
- 是名不顛倒 (shì míng bù diāndǎo) - this is called non-inverted
- 以不倒故 (yǐ bù dǎo gù) - because of non-inversion
- 知字知義 (zhī zì zhī yì) - know the words and know the meaning

"What is the meaning? 'No-self' is called *saṃsāra*; 'self' is called Tathāgata. 'Impermanence' [refers to] śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas; 'permanence' [refers to] the Tathāgata's Dharma-body. 'Suffering' [refers to] all non-Buddhists; 'bliss' precisely is *nirvāṇa*. 'Impurity' precisely is conditioned dharmas; 'purity' [refers to] the true Dharma possessed by Buddhas and Bodhisattvas. This is called non-inverted. Because of non-inversion, [one] knows the words and knows the meaning. If one wishes to distance oneself from the four inversions, one should know such permanence, bliss, self, and purity."

### The Parable of the Physician and the Milk Medicine (Lines 203-206)

[The Buddha then tells an extended parable about a foolish old physician who prescribes milk for all diseases indiscriminately, and a skilled new physician who first bans milk medicine, then later prescribes it skillfully when appropriate. This parable illustrates the Buddha's skillful means in first teaching no-self to counter attachment, then revealing true Self.]

### The Buddha's Final Explanation (Line 207)

**「汝等比丘！當知如來、應、正遍知、明行足、善逝、世間解、無上士、調御丈夫、天人師、佛、世尊，亦復如是，為大醫王，出現於世，降伏一切外道邪醫，諸王眾中唱如是言：『我為醫王。』欲伏外道，故唱是言：『無我、無人、眾生、壽命、養育、知見、作者、受者。』比丘當知，是諸外道所言我者，如虫食木，偶成字耳。是故如來於佛法中，唱言無我，為調眾生故、為知時故，說是無我。有因緣故，亦說有我。如彼良醫，善知於乳是藥非藥，非如凡夫所計吾我。」**

"You bhikṣus! You should know: the Tathāgata, Worthy One, Perfectly Enlightened One, Perfect in Knowledge and Conduct, Well-Gone One, Knower of the World, Unsurpassed One, Tamer of Persons, Teacher of Gods and Humans, Buddha, World-Honored One, is also thus—as the Great Physician King, he appears in the world, subduing all non-Buddhist false physicians. Among the assembly of kings he proclaims thus: 'I am the Physician King.' Wishing to subdue non-Buddhists, therefore he proclaims these words: 'No-self, no-person, no sentient beings, no lifespan, no nourisher, no knower and seer, no agent, no experiencer.' Bhikṣus, you should know: what these non-Buddhists call 'self' is like worms eating wood accidentally forming characters. Therefore the Tathāgata in the Buddha-Dharma proclaims no-self—for the sake of training sentient beings, for the sake of knowing the time, he taught this no-self. Having causes and conditions, he also teaches there is self. Like that excellent physician skillfully knowing regarding milk whether it is medicine or not medicine, [the Buddha's teaching of self is] not like the self reckoned by ordinary people."

**「凡夫愚人所計我者，或言大如拇指、或如芥子、或如微塵；如來說我悉不如是，是故說言，諸法無我，實非無我。何者是我？若法是實、是真、是常、是主、是依、性不變易者，是名為我。如彼大醫善解乳藥，如來亦爾，為眾生故，說諸法中真實有我。汝等四眾，應當如是修習是法。」**

- 凡夫愚人 (fánfū yúrén) - ordinary foolish people
- 所計我者 (suǒ jì wǒ zhě) - the self they reckon
- 或言大如拇指 (huò yán dà rú mǔzhǐ) - some say as large as a thumb
- 或如芥子 (huò rú jièzǐ) - some [say] like a mustard seed
- 或如微塵 (huò rú wēichén) - some [say] like a particle of dust
- 如來說我 (rúlái shuō wǒ) - the self the Tathāgata teaches
- 悉不如是 (xī bù rúshì) - is completely not like this
- 是故說言 (shìgù shuō yán) - therefore it is said
- 諸法無我 (zhū fǎ wúwǒ) - all dharmas are without self

- 應當如是 (yīngdāng rúshì) - should thus
- 修習是法 (xiūxí shì fǎ) - cultivate this dharma

"The self that ordinary foolish people reckon—some say it is as large as a thumb, some [say] like a mustard seed, some [say] like a particle of dust. The self the Tathāgata teaches is completely not like this. Therefore it is said 'all dharmas are without self'—[but] actually [it is] not without self. What is self? If a dharma is real, is true, is permanent, is sovereign, is refuge, its nature does not change or alter—this is called self. Like that great physician skillfully understanding milk medicine, the Tathāgata is also thus: for the sake of sentient beings, he teaches that among all dharmas truly there is self. You of the fourfold assembly should thus cultivate this dharma."

## Key Terms Breakdown

### The Professor's Philological Analysis

**1. 四顛倒 (sì diāndǎo) - The Four Inversions**

- **Sanskrit:** *viparyāsa* (inversion, perversion)
- **Literal meaning:** 四 (four) + 顛倒 (upside-down, inverted)
- **The four inversions:**
  1. Taking impermanence (無常) as permanence (常)
  2. Taking suffering (苦) as bliss (樂)
  3. Taking no-self (無我) as self (我)
  4. Taking impurity (不淨) as purity (淨)
- **Why this translation:** The character 顛倒 (diāndǎo) literally means "topsy-turvy" or "upside-down," vividly conveying the idea of mistaken perception. The Buddha uses this term to describe how ordinary beings misperceive reality.
- **Doctrinal significance:** This is one of the most revolutionary teachings in the Nirvana Sutra. The Buddha reveals that there are **two sets** of four inversions:
  - **Worldly inversions:** Ordinary people see permanence in impermanent things (like the body), bliss in suffering (like sensual pleasures), self in no-self (like the five aggregates), and purity in impurity (like the body).
  - **Spiritual inversions:** The monks (śrāvakas) see impermanence in what is permanent (the Buddha's Dharma-body), suffering in what is bliss (*nirvāṇa*), no-self in what is self (Buddha-nature), and impurity in what is pure (the Dharma).

The teaching corrects both sets of inversions, revealing that true permanence, bliss, self, and purity exist in the transcendent realm.

---

**2. 常樂我淨 (cháng lè wǒ jìng) - Permanence, Bliss, Self, Purity**

- **Sanskrit:** *nitya-sukha-ātman-śubha* (permanent-blissful-self-pure)
- **Literal meaning:** 常 (permanent/eternal) + 樂 (bliss/happiness) + 我 (self/ātman) + 淨 (pure/clean)
- **Why this translation:** These four characters represent the four positive attributes of *nirvāṇa* and the Buddha's Dharma-body. Each character was carefully chosen:
  - 常 (cháng) - "permanent," countering the teaching of impermanence (無常)
  - 樂 (lè) - "bliss," countering the teaching of suffering (苦)
  - 我 (wǒ) - "self," countering the teaching of no-self (無我)
  - 淨 (jìng) - "pure," countering the teaching of impurity (不淨)
- **Doctrinal significance:** This is the Nirvana Sutra's most famous contribution to Mahāyāna doctrine. The Buddha reveals that the earlier teachings of impermanence, suffering, no-self, and impurity were provisional (*upāya*), designed to counter attachment. The ultimate truth is that:
  - The Buddha's Dharma-body is **permanent** (常) - it does not arise or cease
  - *Nirvāṇa* is **bliss** (樂) - it is not mere cessation but positive peace
  - The Buddha-nature is **self** (我) - it is the true, unchanging essence
  - The Dharma is **pure** (淨) - it is unstained by defilements

This teaching profoundly influenced East Asian Buddhism, particularly the doctrine of Buddha-nature (*tathāgatagarbha*).

---

**3. 世間 vs. 出世間 (shìjiān vs. chūshìjiān) - Worldly vs. Transcendent**

- **Sanskrit:** *laukika* vs. *lokottara* (worldly vs. beyond-worldly)
- **Literal meaning:** 世間 (world-within, mundane) vs. 出世間 (exit-world-within, transcendent)
- **Why this translation:** The character 世間 (shìjiān) literally means "within the world" or "worldly," referring to conditioned existence (*saṃsāra*). The character 出 (chū) means "to exit" or "to transcend," so 出世間 (chūshìjiān) means "beyond the worldly" or "transcendent."
- **Doctrinal significance:** The Buddha makes a crucial distinction: both the worldly and the transcendent have "permanence, bliss, self, and purity," but:
  - **Worldly (世間):** "Has the words but not the meaning" (有字無義) - ordinary people use these terms but apply them to impermanent, suffering, selfless, impure things (like the body, sensual pleasures, the ego).
  - **Transcendent (出世間):** "Has the words and the meaning" (有字有義) - these terms correctly apply to the Buddha's Dharma-body, *nirvāṇa*, Buddha-nature, and the Dharma.

This teaching resolves the apparent contradiction between the Buddha's earlier teachings (no-self, impermanence) and the Nirvana Sutra's teachings (true Self, permanence).

---

**4. 如來藏 (rúláicáng) - Tathāgatagarbha (Buddha-nature)**

- **Sanskrit:** *tathāgatagarbha* (womb/embryo of the Tathāgata)
- **Literal meaning:** 如來 (Tathāgata) + 藏 (womb, treasury, storehouse)
- **Why this translation:** Although the term 如來藏 doesn't explicitly appear in this section, it is the doctrinal foundation for the teaching of true Self (我). The character 藏 (cáng) means both "womb" (the source from which the Buddha emerges) and "treasury" (the storehouse of Buddha-qualities hidden within all beings).
- **Doctrinal significance:** The "true Self" (我) that the Buddha teaches is not the ego-self (*ātman*) that ordinary people cling to, but the Buddha-nature (*tathāgatagarbha*) inherent in all beings. The Buddha defines it precisely: "If a dharma is real, is true, is permanent, is sovereign, is refuge, its nature does not change or alter—this is called self." This is the eternal, unchanging Buddha-nature, not the impermanent aggregates.

## Lotus Sutra Connections

### The Professor's Cross-References

This section contains one of the Nirvana Sutra's most distinctive teachings, and it has profound connections to the Lotus Sutra:

**1. The Eternal Buddha and Lotus Chapter 16**

The teaching that the Tathāgata's Dharma-body is **permanent** (常) directly develops the revelation in Lotus Chapter 16 ("Lifespan of the Tathāgata"):

> "Good sons, the Tathāgata sees the true nature of the triple world: it is not born, it does not die; it does not appear, it does not disappear; it is not real, it is not unreal; it is not thus, it is not otherwise. The Tathāgata clearly sees these things as they are, without error."

The Lotus Sutra reveals that the Buddha's *parinirvāṇa* is *upāya*—the Buddha is eternal. The Nirvana Sutra explains the ontological nature of that eternity: the Dharma-body is permanent, unchanging, and real.

**2. The Parable of the Physician and Lotus Chapter 16**

The extended parable of the physician who first bans milk medicine, then later prescribes it skillfully, directly parallels the Parable of the Excellent Physician in Lotus Chapter 16. In both parables:
- The physician (Buddha) uses skillful means to heal
- The medicine (teaching) is adjusted based on the condition of the patients (sentient beings)
- What appears contradictory (first banning, then prescribing milk; first teaching no-self, then teaching true Self) is actually perfect wisdom

The Lotus Sutra's parable focuses on the Buddha's feigned death as *upāya*; the Nirvana Sutra's parable focuses on the Buddha's teaching of no-self as *upāya*.

**3. The One Vehicle and the Correction of Lesser Teachings**

The Buddha's statement that the monks' cultivation of impermanence, suffering, and no-self "has no real meaning" (無有實義) echoes the Lotus Sutra's teaching in Chapter 2 ("Skillful Means") that the three vehicles are provisional:

> "There is only the One Buddha Vehicle; there are not two or three. The Buddhas of the ten directions use countless skillful means, various causes and conditions, similes, and expressions to expound the Dharma to sentient beings. But all of this is for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle."

The Nirvana Sutra specifies what was provisional: the teachings of impermanence, suffering, no-self, and impurity were skillful means to counter attachment. The ultimate truth is permanence, bliss, self, and purity.

**4. The Drunk Person Metaphor**

The Buddha's use of the drunk person metaphor—seeing the sun and moon rotate when they are actually stationary—is a powerful teaching device. The Lotus Sutra uses similar metaphors of inverted perception:

In Lotus Chapter 3 ("Parable of the Burning House"), children playing in a burning house don't perceive the danger. Their perception is inverted—they see safety in danger.

The Nirvana Sutra's teaching is that both ordinary people **and** the monks have inverted perception:
- Ordinary people see permanence in impermanent things
- Monks see impermanence in permanent things (the Dharma-body)

Both need correction.

**5. The Treasure in the Water**

The parable of people diving for a jewel in water but mistaking tiles and rubble for the jewel appears in this section (line 201). This parallels the Lotus Sutra's Parable of the Jewel in the Robe (Chapter 8):

A poor man has a priceless jewel sewn into his robe by a friend, but he doesn't know it and continues to live in poverty. When he finally discovers it, he becomes wealthy.

Both parables teach that beings already possess the ultimate treasure (Buddha-nature, the jewel of enlightenment) but mistake lesser things for it. The Nirvana Sutra emphasizes that the monks are making this mistake—they think impermanence, suffering, and no-self are the ultimate truth, when actually permanence, bliss, and true Self are the jewel.

## Scholarly Notes

**Historical Context:**

This teaching of "permanence, bliss, self, and purity" (常樂我淨) was controversial in early Buddhism. Critics argued it contradicted the Buddha's fundamental teachings of impermanence (*anitya*), suffering (*duḥkha*), and no-self (*anātman*). The Nirvana Sutra's response is sophisticated:

1. **Pedagogical Stages:** The earlier teachings were provisional, designed for a specific audience (those attached to the ego-self). The ultimate teaching is for those ready to understand Buddha-nature.

2. **Semantic Precision:** The "self" taught here is not the *ātman* of Brahmanism (which the Buddha rejected), but the true, unchanging Buddha-nature. The Buddha explicitly distinguishes: "The self that ordinary foolish people reckon... is completely not like this."

3. **Skillful Means:** The parable of the physician shows that the Buddha's teachings must be understood contextually. Just as milk can be medicine or poison depending on the circumstances, the teaching of no-self can be liberating (when countering ego-attachment) or limiting (when preventing recognition of Buddha-nature).

**Philosophical Implications:**

The teaching of true Self (我) in the Nirvana Sutra led to significant developments in Mahāyāna philosophy:

1. **Tathāgatagarbha Doctrine:** The idea that all beings possess Buddha-nature became central to East Asian Buddhism.

2. **Tension with Madhyamaka:** The Madhyamaka school, emphasizing emptiness (*śūnyatā*), sometimes viewed the Nirvana Sutra's teaching of permanent Self as too substantialist. Debates ensued about how to reconcile emptiness with Buddha-nature.

3. **Yogācāra Integration:** The Yogācāra school attempted to synthesize these teachings, identifying Buddha-nature with the *ālayavijñāna* (storehouse consciousness) in its pure state.

**Textual Variants:**

The Tibetan translation of this passage includes additional material on the "three inversions" (想顛倒、心倒、見倒 - inverted perception, inverted mind, inverted view), suggesting possible variations in the Sanskrit source texts.

**Impact on East Asian Buddhism:**

This teaching became foundational:

1. **Tiantai School:** Zhiyi (智顗) used the four qualities (常樂我淨) as attributes of the "true suchness" (*tathatā*).

2. **Chan/Zen:** The teaching that Buddha-nature is the true Self influenced Chan's emphasis on "seeing one's nature" (見性).

3. **Pure Land:** The teaching that *nirvāṇa* is bliss (樂) rather than mere cessation influenced Pure Land Buddhism's emphasis on the blissful Pure Land of Amitābha.
