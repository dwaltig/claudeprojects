### "When the Light Goes Out"

When the Lord said He was leaving, every creature in that place—angels and demons, spirits and snakes, birds and beasts, people and things that ain't quite people—every single one of them felt their skin crawl. Hair standing up on the back of the neck. And they all cried out together, one voice rising up like a moan from the earth itself:

---

**"We bow down low, Lord—  
We're begging You now,  
If You leave us here,  
Ain't nobody gonna save us.  
Ain't nobody gonna show us the way home."**

---

"We see You getting ready to go, Lord, and we're drowning. We're going under in the deep water of hard times. Our hearts are breaking like a calf that lost its mama—crying, looking everywhere, and she ain't coming back.

"We're poor, Lord. We got nothing. We're like a sick man with no doctor, just doing whatever feels right, eating poison and calling it food.

"We got the sickness, Lord—the sickness of wanting what we can't have, hating what we got, running in circles, never satisfied. And we're taking the wrong medicine. We're listening to the wrong voices. We need the Doctor. We need the One who knows how to heal.

"**Don't leave us, Lord. Don't walk away.**

"We're like a country with no king—everybody's starving. That's us, Lord. We lost our shelter. We lost the taste of the Truth. We're hungry and we're cold and we're lost.

"When we heard You were leaving, our minds went sideways. We don't know which way is up. It's like the ground shaking under our feet and we can't find north, south, east, or west. Everything's spinning.

"When You go, Lord, the sun falls out of the sky. The river dries up. We're gonna die of thirst. We're gonna die in the dark.

"We're like a man who just buried his mama and his daddy both. That's how we feel. Orphans. Lost. Alone.

"**If You don't come back, Lord, we got nobody. Nobody to save us. Nobody to show us the way.**

"Even the animals feel it, Lord. Even the dogs and the birds and the things that crawl—they're scared. They're crying. The whole creation is groaning.

"How can we not cry? You're throwing us away like trash. Like something You spit out.

"But Lord—You're like the sun coming up in the morning. Bright. Warm. Chasing away the night. You light up everything—even Yourself. And You chase away all the darkness in us.

"Your light, Lord—Your power—it takes away our pain. And when You stand in the middle of all of us, You're like a mountain. Solid. Unshakeable. We lean on You."

### The Long Petition (When They Wouldn't Let It Go)

Then they kept on. They wouldn't stop. They said:

"Lord, it's like this: Imagine a king who has sons. Beautiful boys. He loves them. He teaches them everything—how to read, how to fight, how to rule. He pours everything into them. And then he hands them over to the executioner. Just gives them away to be killed.

"That's us, Lord. We're Your sons. You taught us. You gave us eyes to see the Truth. And now You're handing us over to death. **Don't do it, Lord. Don't leave us here.**

"And Lord, it don't make sense. It's like a man who studied all the books, knows everything, and then gets scared of what he knows. You know everything, Lord. You understand it all. Why would You be afraid? Why would You run?

"If You stayed, Lord—if You kept teaching us, kept giving us the Truth like sweet water—we wouldn't be scared of hell no more. We'd know the way home.

"Lord, it's like a man just learning to work, and the law comes and throws him in jail. Somebody asks him, 'How you doing?' He says, 'I'm suffering. But if I get out, I'll be free. I'll be at peace.'

"That's You, Lord. You suffered for us. You walked the hard road for us. But we ain't free yet. We're still locked up in this life, this dying, this wheel that keeps turning. How can You rest when we're still in chains?

"And Lord—it's like a doctor who knows all the cures, but he only teaches his own son. He won't teach nobody else. The other students, the ones who came from far away to learn—he just ignores them.

"That's what it feels like, Lord. You taught Mañjuśrī all the deep secrets. You gave him the keys to the kingdom. But us? You left us out in the cold. We know You ain't stingy, Lord. We know You don't play favorites. So why does it feel like You gave him everything and left us with nothing?

"**Stay, Lord. Don't go.**

"We're like old folks and young folks and sick folks, all walking down a bad road. Rough road. Dangerous road. Rocks and holes and snakes in the grass. We're hurting. We're scared. And then somebody comes along who knows the good road—the smooth road, the safe road—and he shows us the way.

"That's what we need, Lord. We're the old ones—weighed down with all the things we done wrong. We're the young ones—we ain't grown up yet in the Truth. We're the sick ones—still dying, still caught in the wheel. And this road we're on? It's the twenty-five kinds of hell. Every way we can be born, every way we can die, every trap we can fall into.

"**Show us the good road, Lord. The road that leads home. Stay here and teach us. Don't go.**"

### The Lord's Answer

Then the Lord looked at His disciples—the monks, the ones who were supposed to know better—and He said:

"Don't cry like the rest of them. Don't fall apart like ordinary folks. You know better. **Get to work. Pay attention. Keep your mind on what's real.**"

And when He said that, all the angels and demons and spirits—they stopped crying. They got quiet. Like a man who finally buries his child and the tears run out and there's nothing left but silence.

## THE ATMOSPHERE

**The Moan:**  
This is the sound of the whole world crying. Not just people—everything. The sky, the earth, the animals, the spirits. When the One who holds it all together says He's leaving, creation itself starts to fall apart. It's the fear of being abandoned. The terror of being left alone in the dark. It's every child who ever lost a parent, every student who ever lost a teacher, every sick person who ever lost their doctor. It's the moan of the orphan.

**The Turnaround:**  
The turnaround is quiet. It's not a shout—it's a whisper. The Lord says, "Stop crying. Get to work." And they do. They stop. Because even in His leaving, He's teaching. Even in the goodbye, there's a lesson: **Don't lean on Me. Lean on the Truth. I'm going, but the Truth stays.** The turnaround is the moment they realize: He ain't abandoning them. He's setting them free.

**The Sound:**  
This should be read like a funeral. Slow. Heavy. Let every metaphor land. Let every image sink in. The calf without its mother. The sick man without a doctor. The country without a king. These ain't just pretty words—they're the truth of what it feels like when the light goes out. But then, at the end, there's that shift. That quiet. That stillness. Read it like the moment after the storm, when the wind stops and you realize you're still standing.

## Key Terms (Endnotes for Learners)

**The Eight Classes (八部眾)**  
In the old teachings, there's eight kinds of beings that show up when something big is happening: angels (devas), dragon-spirits (nāgas), celestial musicians (gandharvas), titans (asuras), divine birds (garuḍas), another kind of celestial musicians (kinnaras), great serpents (mahoragas), and humans plus "non-humans" (which means spirits and creatures that don't fit the other categories). When all eight show up together, you know it's a cosmic event. This ain't just a human thing—this is the whole universe paying attention. And when they all cry together, it means the whole creation is grieving.

**Physician of the Dharma (法醫師)**  
The Lord is the Doctor. Not the kind who gives you pills—the kind who heals your soul. The sickness ain't in your body; it's in your mind, your heart, your spirit. It's the sickness of wanting, hating, being confused, running in circles, never finding peace. The Buddha diagnosed it (that's the First Noble Truth—life is suffering), He told you what causes it (the Second Truth—it's craving), He told you it can be cured (the Third Truth—there's liberation), and He gave you the prescription (the Fourth Truth—the Eightfold Path). Without the Doctor, people take the wrong medicine. They listen to false teachers, follow bad advice, and end up worse off than before.

**The Twenty-Five Modes of Existence (二十五有)**  
This is the full map of the prison. In Buddhist cosmology, there's twenty-five different ways you can be born in *saṃsāra*—the wheel of birth and death. Four in the formless realm (pure consciousness, no body), seven in the form realm (gods with subtle bodies), and fourteen in the desire realm (everything from hell to heaven, including us humans). The assembly calls this the "dangerous road" because every single one of these twenty-five places is a trap. Even heaven. Even being a god. Because it all ends. It all falls apart. And then you're back on the wheel, going round again. The only way out is the path the Buddha shows.

**Ambrosia / Nectar of Immortality (甘露)**  
In the old myths, the gods churned the ocean and pulled out a drink that made you immortal—*amṛta*, the nectar of the gods. In Buddhism, we use that same word, but we mean something different: the Dharma. The Truth. The teaching that sets you free from death. Not because your body lives forever—that ain't the point. But because you wake up to what's real, and when you do, you step off the wheel. You're not born, so you don't die. You're free. That's the "taste of ambrosia" the assembly is begging for. They want the Lord to keep teaching, keep pouring out that sweet water of Truth, so they can drink and be free.

## Lotus Sutra Connections

### The Bluesman's Take

This whole scene—the assembly crying, begging the Lord not to go—it's the setup for what the Lotus Sutra already told us: **The Lord ain't really leaving.**

**Lotus Chapter 16** is the key. That's where the Lord reveals the big secret: "Y'all think I'm dying, but I been free all along. I been enlightened for countless ages. This whole thing—Me being born, growing up, seeking, suffering, waking up, teaching, dying—it's all theater. It's all *upāya*, skillful means. I'm showing you the way, not walking it for the first time Myself."

So when the assembly says, "Don't leave us, we'll have nobody to save us," they're speaking from fear. They don't understand yet. The Lord's "leaving" is part of the teaching. It's the medicine.

In **Lotus Chapter 16**, there's the Parable of the Excellent Physician. A doctor's kids drink poison while he's gone. He comes back, makes an antidote, but some of the kids are so messed up from the poison they won't take the medicine. So the doctor pretends to die. He sends word: "Your father is dead." And when the kids hear that, they panic. They realize they're on their own. And that shock—that terror—makes them take the medicine. And they're healed.

That's what's happening here. The assembly is the kids who drank poison (false teachings, wrong views, the sickness of craving). The Lord is the doctor. And His "death"—His *parinirvāṇa*—is the skillful means that makes them take the Dharma seriously. As long as He's here, they can be lazy. They can say, "We'll practice tomorrow. The Lord's still here." But when He says He's leaving, they wake up. They get urgent. They realize: **This is it. This is my chance. I better not waste it.**

And here's the deeper truth, the one the Nirvana Sutra is about to reveal: The Lord's Dharma-body (法身) is eternal. It don't die. It can't die. So when He says He's entering *nirvāṇa*, He ain't going nowhere. He's just taking off the costume. He's revealing what He's always been: the deathless Truth itself.

**Lotus Chapter 2** says the Buddha never abandons anybody. He uses "various causes and conditions, various similes and parables" to teach, all for the sake of the One Vehicle—the one path that leads everybody home. So when the assembly cries, "You're abandoning us like trash," they're wrong. The Lord ain't abandoning them. He's doing the hardest thing a teacher can do: He's letting go so they can stand on their own.

And that image of the assembly as travelers on a dangerous road, lost and scared, needing somebody to show them the smooth path? That's **Lotus Chapter 3**, the Parable of the Burning House. The three realms of *saṃsāra* are the burning house. The twenty-five modes of existence are the rooms in that house, and every single one of them is on fire. The Buddha is the father calling from outside: "Get out! Come to safety!" But the kids don't listen until he promises them something they want (the three carts—the vehicles of the śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas). And when they come out, he gives them all the same thing: the Great Vehicle, the one cart that carries everybody to liberation.

So this lament—this crying, this begging—it's the sound of beings who don't understand yet. But they will. The Lord's about to teach them. And when He does, they'll realize: **He never left. He's always been here. And He always will be.**
