### Kāśyapa's Question: What is Nirvāṇa? (Lines 79-83)

**「世尊，何等名涅槃？」**

**「善男子！夫涅槃者，名為解脫。」**

**迦葉復言：「所言解脫，為是色耶？為非色乎？」**

- 何等名涅槃 (héděng míng nièpán) - what is called nirvāṇa
- 夫涅槃者 (fū nièpán zhě) - as for nirvāṇa
- 名為解脫 (míng wéi jiětuō) - [it is] called liberation
- 所言解脫 (suǒ yán jiětuō) - what is called liberation
- 為是色耶 (wéi shì sè yé) - is it form
- 為非色乎 (wéi fēi sè hū) - or is it non-form

"'World-Honored One, what is called nirvāṇa?'

"'Good son! As for nirvāṇa, [it is] called liberation.'

"Kāśyapa again said: 'What is called liberation—is it form or is it non-form?'"

### The Buddha's Response: Both Form and Non-Form (Line 85)

**佛言：「善男子！或有是色，或非是色。言非色者，即是聲聞緣覺解脫。言是色者，即是諸佛如來解脫。善男子！是故解脫亦色、非色。如來為諸聲聞弟子說為非色。」**

- 或有是色 (huò yǒu shì sè) - sometimes it is form
- 或非是色 (huò fēi shì sè) - sometimes it is not form
- 言非色者 (yán fēi sè zhě) - speaking of non-form
- 即是聲聞緣覺解脫 (jí shì shēngwén yuánjué jiětuō) - is precisely śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha liberation
- 言是色者 (yán shì sè zhě) - speaking of form
- 即是諸佛如來解脫 (jí shì zhū fó rúlái jiětuō) - is precisely the Buddhas' and Tathāgatas' liberation
- 是故解脫 (shìgù jiětuō) - therefore liberation
- 亦色、非色 (yì sè, fēi sè) - is both form and non-form
- 為諸聲聞弟子 (wéi zhū shēngwén dìzǐ) - for the śrāvaka disciples
- 說為非色 (shuō wéi fēi sè) - [I] speak of [it] as non-form

"The Buddha said: 'Good son! Sometimes it is form, sometimes it is not form. Speaking of non-form, [it] is precisely śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha liberation. Speaking of form, [it] is precisely the Buddhas' and Tathāgatas' liberation. Good son! Therefore liberation is both form and non-form. [But] the Tathāgata for the śrāvaka disciples speaks of [it] as non-form.'"

### Kāśyapa's Follow-up Question (Lines 87-89)

**「世尊！聲聞緣覺若非色者，云何得住？」**

**「善男子！如非想非非想天，亦色非色，我亦說為非色。若人難言：『非想非非想天若非色者，云何得住、去來、進止？』如是之義，諸佛境界，非諸聲聞緣覺所知。解脫亦爾，亦色非色說為非色，亦想非想說為非想，如是之義諸佛境界，非諸聲聞緣覺所知。」**

- 聲聞緣覺若非色者 (shēngwén yuánjué ruò fēi sè zhě) - if śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas [liberation] is non-form
- 云何得住 (yúnhé dé zhù) - how can [they] abide
- 如非想非非想天 (rú fēi xiǎng fēi fēi xiǎng tiān) - like the Heaven of Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception
- 亦色非色 (yì sè fēi sè) - is both form and non-form
- 我亦說為非色 (wǒ yì shuō wéi fēi sè) - I also speak of [it] as non-form
- 若人難言 (ruò rén nán yán) - if a person objects saying
- 云何得住、去來、進止 (yúnhé dé zhù, qùlái, jìnzhǐ) - how can [they] abide, go and come, advance and stop
- 如是之義 (rúshì zhī yì) - such meaning
- 諸佛境界 (zhū fó jìngjiè) - the Buddhas' realm
- 非諸聲聞緣覺所知 (fēi zhū shēngwén yuánjué suǒ zhī) - not what śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas can know
- 亦想非想 (yì xiǎng fēi xiǎng) - both perception and non-perception
- 說為非想 (shuō wéi fēi xiǎng) - speak of [it] as non-perception

"'World-Honored One! If śrāvakas' and pratyekabuddhas' [liberation] is non-form, how can [they] abide?'

"'Good son! Like the Heaven of Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception, [which] is both form and non-form, I also speak of [it] as non-form. If a person objects saying: "If the Heaven of Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception is non-form, how can [they] abide, go and come, advance and stop?" Such meaning [is] the Buddhas' realm, not what śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas can know. Liberation is also thus: both form and non-form, [yet I] speak of [it] as non-form; both perception and non-perception, [yet I] speak of [it] as non-perception. Such meaning [is] the Buddhas' realm, not what śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas can know.'"

## Key Terms Breakdown

### The Professor's Philological Analysis

**1. 色 (sè) - Form**

- **Sanskrit:** *rūpa* (form, matter, materiality)
- **Literal meaning:** 色 originally meant "color" or "appearance," but in Buddhist usage it means "form" or "material reality"
- **Why this translation:** The Chinese translators chose 色 because it captures both the visible aspect (*rūpa* as "appearance") and the substantial aspect (*rūpa* as "matter")
- **Doctrinal significance:** In Buddhist philosophy, *rūpa* is one of the five aggregates (*skandhas*) and represents all material phenomena. The question "Is liberation form or non-form?" is asking: Is nirvāṇa a positive reality (something that exists) or a mere negation (the absence of suffering)?

**2. 非想非非想天 (fēi xiǎng fēi fēi xiǎng tiān) - Heaven of Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception**

- **Sanskrit:** *naivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñāyatana* (sphere of neither-perception-nor-non-perception)
- **Literal meaning:** 非想 (neither perception) + 非非想 (nor non-perception) + 天 (heaven)
- **Why this translation:** This is the highest of the formless heavens in Buddhist cosmology. The Chinese translators used double negation (非...非...) to capture the paradoxical nature of this state
- **Doctrinal significance:** Beings in this heaven have attained the highest meditative state possible within saṃsāra—their consciousness is so refined it can't be called either "perception" or "non-perception." The Buddha uses this as an analogy for liberation: just as this heaven transcends ordinary categories, liberation transcends the categories of "form" and "non-form"

**3. 諸佛境界 (zhū fó jìngjiè) - The Buddhas' Realm**

- **Sanskrit:** *buddha-viṣaya* or *buddha-gocara* (Buddhas' domain/sphere)
- **Literal meaning:** 諸佛 (all Buddhas) + 境界 (realm, sphere, domain)
- **Why this translation:** 境界 can mean "境" (objective realm) + "界" (boundary, sphere), suggesting both a domain of experience and a level of understanding
- **Doctrinal significance:** This phrase indicates that certain teachings transcend the comprehension of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. Only Buddhas can fully understand the paradoxical nature of liberation as both form and non-form

## Lotus Sutra Connections

### The Professor's Cross-References

**1. The Ineffability of Buddha-Wisdom (Lotus Chapter 2)**

This passage's teaching that liberation is "both form and non-form" yet "spoken of as non-form" parallels the Lotus Sutra's teaching on the ineffability of Buddha-wisdom:

Lotus Chapter 2 states:

> "The wisdom of the Buddhas is infinitely profound and immeasurable... The Buddhas alone, together with other Buddhas, can fathom the reality of all existence."

Both texts teach that ultimate reality transcends ordinary categories and can only be fully understood by Buddhas.

**2. Skillful Means in Teaching (Lotus Chapter 2)**

The Buddha's statement "For the śrāvaka disciples [I] speak of [it] as non-form" exemplifies skillful means (*upāya*). The Lotus Sutra teaches that the Buddha adapts his teaching to the capacity of his audience—he teaches liberation as "non-form" to śrāvakas because they can't yet comprehend the fuller truth.

**3. The Dharma-Body (Lotus Chapter 16)**

The distinction between śrāvakas' liberation (non-form) and the Tathāgata's liberation (form) relates to the Lotus Sutra's teaching on the eternal Dharma-body. The Tathāgata's liberation is "form" because the Dharma-body is a positive reality, not mere negation.

## Scholarly Notes

**The Form/Non-Form Debate:**

This passage addresses a fundamental philosophical question in Buddhism: Is nirvāṇa a positive reality or merely the cessation of suffering?

- **Early Buddhist view:** Nirvāṇa is "non-form"—the extinction of the aggregates, the cessation of becoming
- **Mahāyāna view:** Nirvāṇa is both form and non-form—it's the positive reality of the Dharma-body, yet it transcends all conceptual categories

The Nirvana Sutra's answer is sophisticated: Liberation is "both form and non-form," but this paradox can only be fully understood by Buddhas. For pedagogical purposes, the Buddha teaches it as "non-form" to śrāvakas.

**The Neither-Perception-Nor-Non-Perception Heaven:**

This is the highest of the four formless heavens (*ārūpyadhātu*) in Buddhist cosmology. Beings there have transcended all material form and achieved the most refined state of consciousness possible within saṃsāra. Yet even this is not liberation—it's still conditioned existence.

The Buddha uses this as an analogy: Just as this heaven is paradoxically "both form and non-form" (it has no material form but still has subtle mental form), liberation is paradoxically "both form and non-form."
