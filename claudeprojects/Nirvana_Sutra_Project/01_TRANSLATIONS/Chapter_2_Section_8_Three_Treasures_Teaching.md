Distance yourselves from all non-dharmas,  
Comfort your minds and receive joy."

### The Rarity of the Buddha's Appearance

**「諸比丘！佛出世難，人身難得，值佛生信是事亦難，能忍難忍是亦復難，成就禁戒具足無缺、得阿羅漢果是事亦難，如求金沙優曇鉢花。汝諸比丘！離於八難得人身難，汝等遇我不應空過。我於往昔種種苦行，今得如是無上方便，為汝等故，無量劫中捨身、手足、頭目、髓腦，是故汝等不應放逸。」**

You bhikṣus! Free from the eight difficulties, obtaining a human body is difficult. You all encountering me should not pass in vain. I in past times [practiced] various austerities; now I have obtained thus the supreme skillful means. For your sake, in countless kalpas I gave up my body, hands and feet, head and eyes, marrow and brain. Therefore you all should not be negligent."

### The Secret Treasury: Three Dots of the Sanskrit "i" (伊字三點)

**「何等名為祕密之藏？猶如伊字三點，若並則不成伊，縱亦不成；如摩醯首羅面上三目，乃得成伊三點，若別亦不得成。我亦如是，解脫之法亦非涅槃，如來之身亦非涅槃，摩訶般若亦非涅槃，三法各異亦非涅槃。我今安住如是三法，為眾生故，名入涅槃，如世伊字。」**

- 何等名為 (héděng míngwéi) - what is called
- 祕密之藏 (mìmì zhī cáng) - the secret treasury
- 猶如 (yóurú) - just like
- 伊字三點 (yī zì sān diǎn) - the three dots of the letter "i"
- 若並 (ruò bìng) - if side by side
- 則不成伊 (zé bù chéng yī) - then does not form "i"
- 縱亦不成 (zòng yì bù chéng) - vertical also does not form [it]
- 如摩醯首羅 (rú móxīshǒuluó) - like Maheśvara
- 面上三目 (miàn shàng sān mù) - three eyes on the face
- 乃得成 (nǎi dé chéng) - only then forms
- 伊三點 (yī sān diǎn) - the three dots of "i"
- 若別 (ruò bié) - if separate
- 亦不得成 (yì bù dé chéng) - also cannot form [it]
- 我亦如是 (wǒ yì rúshì) - I am also thus
- 解脫之法 (jiětuō zhī fǎ) - the dharma of liberation
- 亦非涅槃 (yì fēi nièpán) - is also not *nirvāṇa*
- 如來之身 (rúlái zhī shēn) - the Tathāgata's body
- 亦非涅槃 (yì fēi nièpán) - is also not *nirvāṇa*
- 摩訶般若 (móhē bōrě) - *mahāprajñā*, great wisdom
- 亦非涅槃 (yì fēi nièpán) - is also not *nirvāṇa*
- 三法各異 (sān fǎ gè yì) - the three dharmas each different
- 亦非涅槃 (yì fēi nièpán) - is also not *nirvāṇa*
- 我今安住 (wǒ jīn ānzhù) - I now peacefully abide
- 如是三法 (rúshì sān fǎ) - in these three dharmas
- 為眾生故 (wéi zhòngshēng gù) - for the sake of sentient beings
- 名入涅槃 (míng rù nièpán) - it is called entering *nirvāṇa*
- 如世伊字 (rú shì yī zì) - like the worldly letter "i"

"What is called the secret treasury? Just like the three dots of the letter 'i' (इ)—if [arranged] side by side, then it does not form 'i'; [if arranged] vertically, it also does not form [it]. Like Maheśvara's three eyes on the face, only then does it form the three dots of 'i'. If separate, it also cannot form [it]. I am also thus: the dharma of liberation is also not *nirvāṇa*; the Tathāgata's body is also not *nirvāṇa*; *mahāprajñā* is also not *nirvāṇa*; the three dharmas each different is also not *nirvāṇa*. I now peacefully abide in these three dharmas. For the sake of sentient beings, it is called entering *nirvāṇa*, like the worldly letter 'i'."

## Key Terms Breakdown

### The Professor's Philological Analysis

**1. 伊字三點 (yī zì sān diǎn) - The Three Dots of the Sanskrit Letter "i"**

- **Sanskrit:** The letter इ (*i*) in Devanāgarī script, or the vowel marker ि in compound form
- **Literal meaning:** 伊 (transliteration of Sanskrit *i*) + 字 (letter/character) + 三點 (three dots/marks)
- **Why this translation:** This is one of the most famous images in the Nirvana Sutra. The Chinese translators used 伊 (yī) to phonetically represent the Sanskrit vowel *i*. The "three dots" refer to the visual appearance of the Sanskrit letter इ, which in some scripts appears to have three distinct elements. More importantly, it references the three-dot vowel marker (ि◌ः) used in Sanskrit grammar.
- **Doctrinal significance:** This is the Nirvana Sutra's unique contribution to Mahāyāna doctrine. The three aspects—Liberation (*vimokṣa*/解脫), Dharma-body (*dharmakāya*/法身), and Great Wisdom (*mahāprajñā*/摩訶般若)—are distinct but inseparable, like the three components of the Sanskrit letter. None alone constitutes *nirvāṇa*; only their simultaneous presence forms true *nirvāṇa*. This teaching counters the Hīnayāna view that *nirvāṇa* is merely the cessation of afflictions (liberation alone).

**Visual Explanation:**
- Horizontal arrangement (並): ∴ (does not form इ)
- Vertical arrangement (縱): ⁝ (does not form इ)
- Triangular arrangement (like Maheśvara's three eyes): ∴ arranged as ∵ (forms इ)

---

**2. 摩醯首羅 (móxīshǒuluó) - Maheśvara**

- **Sanskrit:** *Maheśvara* (Great Lord), an epithet of Śiva
- **Literal meaning:** 摩醯 (mahā, great) + 首羅 (īśvara, lord)
- **Why this translation:** The Chinese transliteration preserves the Sanskrit name of the Hindu deity Śiva in his aspect as "Great Lord." The reference to his "three eyes on the face" (面上三目) alludes to Śiva's distinctive iconography—he possesses a third eye in the center of his forehead, which represents wisdom and the power to destroy ignorance.
- **Doctrinal significance:** The Buddha uses a Hindu deity as a teaching metaphor, showing the inclusive nature of Buddhist pedagogy. The three eyes of Śiva (two ordinary eyes plus the wisdom eye) arranged in a triangle on the face provide a visual analogy for how the three aspects of *nirvāṇa* must be simultaneously present and properly configured. This is skillful means (*upāya*)—using familiar cultural imagery to convey Buddhist truth.

---

**3. 祕密藏 (mìmì cáng) - The Secret Treasury**

- **Sanskrit:** *guhyagarbha* (secret womb/treasury)
- **Literal meaning:** 祕密 (secret, hidden) + 藏 (treasury, storehouse, womb)
- **Why this translation:** The character 藏 (cáng) is multivalent—it means both "treasury" (a place where precious things are stored) and "womb" (the source from which things emerge). This dual meaning is intentional: the secret treasury is both the repository of the Buddha's ultimate teaching and the source from which enlightenment emerges. The term 祕密 (mìmì) doesn't mean "deliberately concealed" but rather "profound and not immediately apparent"—it requires wisdom to perceive.
- **Doctrinal significance:** The "secret treasury" is the teaching that all beings possess Buddha-nature (*buddhatā*/佛性) and that true *nirvāṇa* is not annihilation but the eternal, blissful Dharma-body. This teaching was "secret" not because the Buddha withheld it, but because beings lacked the capacity to understand it until properly prepared. The Nirvana Sutra claims to be the final, complete revelation of this treasury.

---

**4. 四部之眾 (sìbù zhī zhòng) - The Fourfold Assembly**

- **Sanskrit:** *catasraḥ parṣadaḥ* (four assemblies)
- **Literal meaning:** 四部 (four divisions) + 之 (possessive particle) + 眾 (assembly)
- **The four assemblies:** bhikṣus (比丘, monks), bhikṣuṇīs (比丘尼, nuns), upāsakas (優婆塞, laymen), upāsikās (優婆夷, laywomen)
- **Why this translation:** The character 部 (bù) means "division" or "category," reflecting the organizational structure of the Buddhist community (*saṅgha*). The fourfold assembly represents the complete Buddhist community, including both monastic and lay practitioners.
- **Doctrinal significance:** By stating that he will cause "all sentient beings and also my sons, the fourfold assembly" to abide in the secret treasury, the Buddha emphasizes the universal accessibility of the highest teaching. The secret treasury is not reserved for an elite few—it is the birthright of all beings. This is a distinctly Mahāyāna emphasis.

## Lotus Sutra Connections

### The Professor's Cross-References

This section contains the Nirvana Sutra's most distinctive doctrinal teaching, and it has profound connections to the Lotus Sutra's central themes:

**1. The Eternal Dharma-Body and Lotus Chapter 16**

The teaching that the Tathāgata's body (*dharmakāya*) is one of the three inseparable aspects of *nirvāṇa* directly develops the doctrine revealed in Lotus Chapter 16 ("Lifespan of the Tathāgata"). In that chapter, the Buddha reveals:

> "Good sons, I actually attained Buddhahood in the limitless, boundless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of *nayutas* of kalpas past... Since then I have constantly been in this *sahā* world expounding the Dharma and teaching. I have also led and benefited sentient beings in hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of *nayutas* of other lands."

The Lotus Sutra establishes that the Buddha's *parinirvāṇa* is *upāya* (skillful means)—the Buddha's true nature is eternal. The Nirvana Sutra develops this by explaining the ontological structure of that eternal nature: it is the inseparable unity of Liberation, Dharma-body, and Wisdom.

**2. The Three Vehicles and the One Vehicle**

The Buddha's warning to the bhikṣus—"You have obtained leaving home, [yet] regarding this Mahāyāna do not generate longing... you have never yet begged for Mahāyāna Dharma-food"—echoes the Lotus Sutra's central teaching that the three vehicles (śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, bodhisattva) are provisional, and only the One Buddha Vehicle is ultimate.

In Lotus Chapter 2 ("Skillful Means"), the Buddha declares:

> "The Buddhas, the World-Honored Ones, only teach and convert bodhisattvas. All their actions are always for the one matter—they only wish to demonstrate the Buddha's knowledge and insight to sentient beings."

The Nirvana Sutra's teaching that Liberation alone (the goal of śrāvakas) is "not *nirvāṇa*" reinforces this: true *nirvāṇa* requires the complete realization embodied in the Mahāyāna path.

**3. The Treasure City and Lotus Chapter 7**

The metaphor of the "Dharma treasure city" that the bhikṣus encounter but fail to properly appreciate parallels the Parable of the Phantom City in Lotus Chapter 7. In that parable, a guide leads exhausted travelers toward a treasure city. Midway, seeing them ready to turn back, he conjures a phantom city where they can rest. After they are refreshed, he reveals it was an illusion and urges them onward to the real treasure city.

The Nirvana Sutra's image works similarly: the bhikṣus have reached the "phantom city" of *arhatship* (liberation from afflictions) but mistake it for the final goal. The Buddha urges them not to "take tiles and rubble" (lesser teachings) when the true treasures (Dharma-body and Wisdom) are available.

**4. The Secret Treasury and the Lotus Sutra's "Difficult to Believe and Difficult to Understand"**

In Lotus Chapter 2, after expounding the doctrine of the One Vehicle, the Buddha states:

> "The Dharma attained by the Buddhas is the foremost rarity, difficult to understand. Only a Buddha together with a Buddha can fathom the true reality of all dharmas."

The Nirvana Sutra's "secret treasury" (*guhyagarbha*) is precisely this "difficult to understand" teaching. It is "secret" not because it is withheld, but because it transcends conceptual understanding. The teaching of the three-in-one nature of *nirvāṇa* (like the Sanskrit letter इ) is the Nirvana Sutra's way of articulating what the Lotus Sutra calls "the true reality of all dharmas."

**5. The Udumbara Flower**

The Buddha's statement that encountering a Buddha and generating faith is "like seeking gold dust or the *udumbara* flower" directly references a common Buddhist metaphor for extreme rarity. The *udumbara* (*Ficus racemosa*) was believed to bloom only once every three thousand years, coinciding with the appearance of a Buddha in the world.

This same metaphor appears in Lotus Chapter 27 ("King Wonderful Adornment"), where the Buddha states:

> "Good sons, it is difficult to encounter a Buddha. It is like the *udumbara* flower, which appears only once in a long time."

Both sūtras use this image to create urgency: the opportunity to hear the ultimate teaching is vanishingly rare and must not be wasted.

## Scholarly Notes

**The Sanskrit Letter इ and Its Theological Significance:**

The image of the Sanskrit letter इ (*i*) as a symbol for the triune nature of *nirvāṇa* is unique to the Nirvana Sutra and became highly influential in East Asian Buddhism, particularly in the Tiantai (天台) and Huayan (華嚴) schools.

The visual metaphor works on multiple levels:

1. **Phonetic:** In Sanskrit grammar, the vowel *i* (इ) is fundamental—it appears in countless words and is one of the primary vowels in the language. Similarly, the three aspects of *nirvāṇa* are fundamental to Buddhist realization.

2. **Visual:** The Devanāgarī letter इ can be analyzed as having three components: the vertical line (।), the horizontal top (ि), and the curved bottom (ी). These three elements must be properly configured to form the letter—just as Liberation, Dharma-body, and Wisdom must be simultaneously present and properly integrated to constitute true *nirvāṇa*.

3. **Theological:** The insistence that none of the three alone constitutes *nirvāṇa*, but only their simultaneous presence, counters both Hīnayāna views (which emphasize Liberation alone) and certain Mahāyāna views (which might overemphasize Wisdom or Dharma-body at the expense of the others).

**Maheśvara's Three Eyes:**

The reference to Śiva (Maheśvara) is significant for several reasons:

1. **Cultural Context:** In 5th-century India (when this sūtra was likely composed), Śaivism was a major religious force. The Buddha's use of Śiva as a teaching metaphor shows Buddhism's willingness to engage with Hindu imagery.

2. **Iconographic Precision:** Śiva's three eyes are arranged in a triangle on his face—two horizontal (the ordinary eyes) and one vertical (the wisdom eye in the center of the forehead). This triangular configuration provides the visual model for how the three aspects of *nirvāṇa* must be arranged: not horizontally (並), not vertically (縱), but in a triangular, simultaneous configuration.

3. **Theological Appropriation:** By using Śiva as a metaphor, the Buddha subtly suggests that even the "Great Lord" of Hinduism is merely a symbol pointing toward Buddhist truth. This is a form of *upāya*—meeting people where they are (in a Hindu cultural context) and leading them to Buddhist realization.

**The "Secret Treasury" in Mahāyāna Literature:**

The term *guhyagarbha* (祕密藏) appears in several Mahāyāna texts, most notably:

1. **Tathāgatagarbha Sūtra** (如來藏經): Teaches that all beings possess the "womb of the Tathāgata" (Buddha-nature) hidden within them.

2. **Śrīmālādevī Siṃhanāda Sūtra** (勝鬘經): Queen Śrīmālā teaches about the "one vehicle" and the "Dharma-body that is eternal."

3. **Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra** (楞伽經): Discusses the *tathāgatagarbha* as the ultimate reality underlying all phenomena.

The Nirvana Sutra's contribution is to specify the structure of this "secret treasury": it is the triune nature of Liberation, Dharma-body, and Wisdom.

**Historical Impact:**

This teaching became foundational for East Asian Buddhism:

1. **Tiantai School:** Zhiyi (智顗) used the three-in-one structure to develop his doctrine of the "three truths" (三諦): emptiness, conventional existence, and the middle way.

2. **Huayan School:** Fazang (法藏) incorporated this into his teaching of the "three natures" (三性) and the interpenetration of all phenomena.

3. **Chan/Zen:** The insistence that *nirvāṇa* is not mere cessation but the positive presence of Dharma-body and Wisdom influenced Chan's emphasis on "seeing one's nature" (見性) as the realization of inherent Buddhahood.
