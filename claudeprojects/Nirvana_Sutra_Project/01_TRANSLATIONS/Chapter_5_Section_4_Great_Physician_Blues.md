## Agent 2: The Bluesman (Blues Vernacular)

### 'The Healing Man'

The Lord said to Kāśyapa:

'When I say '**great** nirvāṇa,' I'm talking about something **vast**. Something **wide**. Something that covers everything.

'It's like a man who lives forever—we call him a **great man**. And if that man lives right, if he walks in the truth, we call him the **best** among all people.

'You know those eight great awakenings I taught? If one person's got all eight of them, he's the **supreme** one.

'And nirvāṇa? **Nirvāṇa is healing**. Nirvāṇa is **no more sores**. Nirvāṇa is **no more wounds**. Nirvāṇa is **whole**.

### The Parable of the Healing Man

'Let Me tell you a story.

'Imagine a man gets shot with a poisoned arrow. He's in pain—**bad** pain. The poison's spreading. He's suffering. He's dying.

'Then a good doctor comes along. The doctor pulls out the arrow. The doctor puts medicine on the wound. The poison stops spreading. The pain goes away. The man's healed. The man's at peace.

'Now, what does that doctor do next? Does he sit down and rest?

'No. He gets up. He goes to the next town. He goes to the next village. Wherever there's people suffering—people with sores, people with wounds, people with diseases—he goes there. And he heals them.

'That's what **I** do, Kāśyapa.

'I became enlightened. I became the **Great Physician King**. And I looked out at this world—at Jambudvīpa, at all you suffering people—and I saw you've been shot with poisoned arrows. Not real arrows. **Spiritual** arrows. The arrows of lust, anger, and delusion. The arrows of all your afflictions, all your troubles, all your pain.

'And you've been suffering for **lifetimes**. For **countless lifetimes**. The poison's been spreading. The pain's been getting worse.

'So what did I do?

'I gave you the medicine. I gave you the **Mahāyāna sūtras**—the **ambrosia**, the **nectar of immortality**, the **Dharma medicine**. I healed you.

'And now that I've healed the people in this world, I'm going to other worlds. I'm going to other places where people are suffering, where people are shot with poisoned arrows. And I'm going to manifest as a Buddha there. And I'm going to heal them too.

'**That's** why it's called '**great** nirvāṇa.' Because it ain't just for one person. It ain't just for one world. It's for **everybody, everywhere**. It's the **place of liberation**. And wherever there's beings who need to be healed, I'm going to show up and heal them.

'That's the **true**, **deep** meaning of great nirvāṇa.'

### Kāśyapa's Question

Kāśyapa said:

'Lord, can a doctor heal **everybody**? Can a doctor cure **every** disease?'

The Lord said:

'Good question, Kāśyapa. No. A doctor can't cure everybody. Because there's **two kinds** of diseases:

'**First kind:** The kind that can be cured. If a disease can be cured, a doctor can cure it.

'**Second kind:** The kind that **can't** be cured. If a disease can't be cured, a doctor can't cure it. Simple as that.'

Kāśyapa said:

'Wait, Lord. If that's true, then You're saying You've healed all the people in this world. But if You've healed them all, how come there's still people who ain't reached nirvāṇa yet? How come there's still people suffering?

'And if You **ain't** healed them all, how can You say You're done here and You're ready to go to other worlds?'

---

### The Lord's Answer: Two Kinds of People

The Lord said:

'Kāśyapa, listen. In this world, there's **two kinds** of people:

'**First kind:** People with **faith**. People who believe. People who trust the Dharma.

'**Second kind:** People **without** faith. People who don't believe. People who don't trust.

'Now, the people with faith—they're **treatable**. Why? Because they're going to reach nirvāṇa. They're going to be healed. They got no more sores, no more wounds. They're **whole**.

'So when I say I've healed all the people in this world, I'm talking about **them**. I'm talking about the people with faith. They're cured.

'But the people without faith—they're called **icchantikas**. And icchantikas are **untreatable**. Not because I don't want to heal them. Not because I don't got the medicine. But because **they won't take it**. They don't believe. They don't trust. They won't open their mouths and swallow the medicine.

'So except for the icchantikas, everybody else is healed. That's why nirvāṇa is called '**no more sores, no more wounds**.' Because for the people who got faith, the healing's done. They're whole. They're free.'

## THE ATMOSPHERE

**The Moan:**  
The moan here is the sound of suffering—deep, long suffering. It's the image of a man shot with a poisoned arrow, the poison spreading, the pain getting worse. It's the moan of **lifetimes** of pain, lifetimes of lust and anger and delusion tearing you apart. It's the moan of knowing you're sick, knowing you're wounded, knowing you need help but not knowing where to find it. It's the moan of desperation, of crying out for a doctor, for a healer, for somebody who can make the pain stop.

**The Turnaround:**  
The turnaround is the arrival of the **Great Physician King**. It's the Lord pulling out the poisoned arrow. It's the Lord putting medicine on the wound. It's the Lord healing you, making you whole, setting you free. The turnaround is realizing: **The doctor's here. The medicine's here. The healing's available.** All you gotta do is **take it**. All you gotta do is have **faith**. All you gotta do is **believe**. And if you do, you're cured. You're healed. You're free. You got no more sores, no more wounds. You're **whole**.

**The Sound:**  
This should be read like a testimony—like somebody who's been healed and is telling the story of how it happened. The parable of the poisoned arrow should be vivid and visceral—let the pain land, let the suffering be real. Then let the relief land—the doctor comes, the arrow's pulled out, the medicine's applied, the pain stops. That's the gospel. That's the good news. And when the Lord says, 'That's what **I** do'—let that be powerful. Let that be the moment of revelation. This is the Lord's work. This is His mission. This is why He's here. To heal. To cure. To set people free.

## Key Terms (Endnotes for Learners)

**The Great Physician King (大醫王)**  
This is one of the Buddha's titles. It means He's the **supreme healer**—the best doctor, the king of all physicians.

The metaphor works like this:
- **The disease:** Suffering, caused by lust, anger, and delusion
- **The diagnosis:** The Four Noble Truths (there's suffering, it's got a cause, it can end, here's how)
- **The medicine:** The Dharma—the Buddha's teaching
- **The cure:** Nirvāṇa—liberation, freedom, wholeness

The Buddha don't just diagnose the problem. He don't just prescribe the medicine. He **gives** you the medicine. He **heals** you. That's why He's the Great Physician King.

**Sores and Wounds (瘡疣)**  
This is a metaphor for **afflictions**—all the things that mess you up spiritually. Lust, anger, delusion, greed, jealousy, pride—all of it. These are like sores and wounds on your soul.

Nirvāṇa is called 'without sores and wounds' because when you reach nirvāṇa, you're **healed**. You're **whole**. All those afflictions are gone. You're clean. You're free.

**Icchantika (一闡提)**  
This is a tough one. An *icchantika* is somebody who's got **no faith**. Somebody who don't believe in the Dharma. Somebody who's cut off all their good roots.

The Buddha says icchantikas are 'untreatable'—like a disease that can't be cured. But here's the thing: **It ain't permanent**. The Nirvana Sutra says elsewhere that even icchantikas can eventually be saved. They just ain't ready **yet**. They ain't got faith **yet**. But one day, maybe in a future lifetime, they'll develop faith. And when they do, they'll be treatable. They'll be healed.

So 'untreatable' don't mean 'hopeless.' It just means 'not ready yet.'

**Ambrosia Dharma Medicine (甘露法藥)**  
Ambrosia is the nectar of immortality—the drink of the gods in Indian mythology. It makes you deathless.

The Buddha's teaching is called 'ambrosia' because it leads to the 'deathless' state—nirvāṇa. Not physical immortality (your body still dies), but **spiritual** immortality. You're free from the cycle of birth and death. You're liberated. You're eternal.

The 'Dharma medicine' is the Buddha's teaching—the sūtras, the precepts, the practices. It's the cure for the disease of suffering.

**Great Nirvāṇa (大般涅槃)**  
The Buddha explains why His nirvāṇa is called 'great':

1. **It's universal:** He heals beings in **all** worlds, not just one
2. **It's eternal:** His healing work **never stops**
3. **It's complete:** He leads beings to **total** liberation, not just temporary relief

This is different from the nirvāṇa of the disciples (the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas), which is limited. The Buddha's nirvāṇa is **great** because it's unlimited, eternal, and complete.

## Lotus Sutra Connections

### The Bluesman's Take

This whole section is **Lotus Sutra Chapter 16** again—the Parable of the Excellent Physician.

**The Parable of the Excellent Physician (Lotus Chapter 16)**

In Lotus Chapter 16, the Lord tells a parable:

A doctor's kids drink poison. The doctor makes medicine, but some kids—their minds messed up by the poison—won't take it. So the doctor uses skillful means: He pretends to go on a journey and sends word that he died. The kids, shocked by their father's 'death,' come to their senses, take the medicine, and get cured. Then the father comes back.

The parallel to this section:

- **The poison:** Lust, anger, delusion = the poisoned arrows
- **The doctor:** The Buddha = the Great Physician King
- **The medicine:** The Dharma = the ambrosia Dharma medicine
- **The kids who won't take the medicine:** Icchantikas = untreatable beings
- **The father's 'death':** The Buddha's parinirvāṇa = going to other worlds

Both parables teach: **The Buddha's here to heal you. The medicine's available. But you gotta take it.** You gotta have faith. You gotta believe. If you do, you're cured. If you don't, you stay sick—not because the Buddha can't heal you, but because you won't let Him.

**The Eternal Buddha's Work (Lotus Chapter 16)**

The Buddha says He heals beings in this world, then goes to other worlds to heal beings there. That's **Lotus Chapter 16**:

> 'Ever since then I have been constantly in this sahā world, preaching the Law, teaching, and converting. And elsewhere I have led and benefited living beings in hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of lands.'

The Buddha's work **never stops**. He's always healing. He's always teaching. He's always manifesting in different worlds to help different beings. That's why His nirvāṇa is 'great'—it ain't the end of His work. It's the **continuation** of His work in a bigger, wider, eternal way.

**Faith as the Key (Lotus Chapter 2)**

The Buddha says the people with faith are treatable, and the people without faith (icchantikas) are untreatable. That's the same teaching as **Lotus Chapter 2**:

> 'If there are living beings who have already made offerings to hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of Buddhas and have planted numerous good roots, when they hear this Law they will embrace it with faith.'

**Faith is the key.** You gotta believe. You gotta trust. You gotta open your heart and receive the teaching. If you do, you're healed. If you don't, the medicine can't work—not because it ain't powerful, but because you won't take it.

So the question is: **Do you got faith?** Do you believe the Buddha can heal you? Do you trust the Dharma? Are you ready to take the medicine?

If you are, you're treatable. You're going to be healed. You're going to reach nirvāṇa. You're going to be whole.

And if you ain't ready yet—if you're an icchantika right now—that's okay. The Buddha ain't giving up on you. He's just going to other worlds for now. But He'll be back. And when you're ready, when you got faith, He'll heal you too.

Because the Great Physician King **never stops healing**. He **never gives up**. He's always working, always teaching, always manifesting, always offering the medicine.

All you gotta do is **take it**.
