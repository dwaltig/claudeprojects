## Agent 2: The Bluesman (Blues Vernacular)

### "The Real Deal: What Lasts, What's True"

The monks heard the Lord was leaving, and they fell apart. Hair standing up, tears streaming down, bowing low, walking circles around Him, crying out:

"Lord! You taught us so good—You taught us nothing lasts, everything hurts, there ain't no self, nothing's clean. That teaching—it's the best. It's like the elephant's footprint, bigger than all the others. It's like plowing in the fall, turning over the earth, killing the weeds. That's what the teaching of impermanence does—it kills the craving, the pride, the confusion.

"So Lord, if You know nothing lasts, how can You leave? And if You're free from thinking nothing lasts, how'd You get free by teaching it?

"Stay, Lord. Finish the work. Set us free. We ain't free yet."

### The Lord's Response: "You Got It Backwards"

Then the Lord praised them: "Good. Good. You know how to practice no-self."

And the monks said, "Lord, we don't just practice no-self. We practice all of it—suffering, impermanence, no-self, impurity. We practice it all."

Then the Lord said:

**"Listen close. Listen real close.**

"You know the words, but you don't know what they mean.

"You're like a drunk man looking up at the sky. The sun and the moon ain't moving, but he sees them spinning. That's you. That's all of us.

"You're covered up—covered by wanting, hating, not knowing. And because you're covered, you see everything backwards.

"**What IS—you call it ISN'T.**  
**What LASTS—you call it DOESN'T LAST.**  
**What's PURE—you call it DIRTY.**  
**What's BLISS—you call it SUFFERING.**

"You're drunk, and you think the world is spinning. But it ain't the world. It's you.

"Listen:

"**'Self'—that's what I am. That's what the Buddha is.**  
**'Permanence'—that's the Dharma-Body, the Truth that don't change.**  
**'Bliss'—that's *nirvāṇa*, the real peace.**  
**'Purity'—that's the Dharma, the teaching that's clean.**

"How can you say that people who know there's a Self are proud and stuck in the wheel? You got it backwards.

"You say you practice impermanence, suffering, no-self. But that practice—it don't mean nothing if you don't know what's real.

"Let me tell you what's real:

"**There's two kinds of backwards.**

"**First backwards:** You see suffering and call it bliss. You see what don't last and call it permanent. You see what ain't you and call it yourself. You see what's dirty and call it clean. That's the world. That's ordinary folks. They think their body's gonna last. They think pleasure's gonna satisfy them. They think their ego is who they are. They think this life is pure. **That's backwards.**

"**Second backwards:** You see bliss and call it suffering. You see what lasts and call it temporary. You see what IS and call it nothing. You see what's clean and call it dirty. That's you, monks. You think *nirvāṇa*'s just the end of suffering. You think the Dharma-Body is temporary. You think there ain't no true Self. You think the Dharma's impure. **That's backwards too.**

"Both of you—the world and you monks—you got the words, but you don't got the meaning.

"The world says 'permanent, bliss, self, pure,' but they're talking about the body, about pleasure, about the ego, about this life. **They got the words, but not the meaning.**

"You monks say 'impermanent, suffering, no-self, impure,' and you think that's the end of the story. **You got the words, but not the meaning either.**

"Here's the meaning:

"**'No-self'—that's *saṃsāra*. That's the wheel. That's birth and death.**  
**'Self'—that's the Tathāgata. That's the real you, the Buddha-nature.**

"**'Impermanence'—that's the hearers and the solitary realizers. They're still changing.**  
**'Permanence'—that's the Dharma-Body. That's what don't change.**

"**'Suffering'—that's the outsiders, the ones who don't know the way.**  
**'Bliss'—that's *nirvāṇa*. That's the real peace.**

"**'Impurity'—that's everything that's made, everything that's conditioned.**  
**'Purity'—that's the Dharma, the truth the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas know.**

"If you wanna get free from being backwards, you gotta know this: **There IS permanence. There IS bliss. There IS self. There IS purity.**

"Not the fake kind. The real kind."

### The Parable of the Physician and the Milk

Then the Lord told them a story:

"There was a king, and he had a doctor—an old doctor who didn't know much. This doctor gave everybody the same medicine: milk. Didn't matter what was wrong with you—fever, chills, headache, stomachache—he'd say, 'Drink milk.' And the king didn't know any better, so he paid the doctor good money.

"Then a new doctor came to town—a real doctor, a skilled one. He saw what the old doctor was doing, and he knew it was wrong. But he was smart. He didn't just call the old doctor out. He played it slow.

"He went to the old doctor and said, 'I wanna learn from you. Teach me.' And the old doctor, full of pride, said, 'Sure, but you gotta work for me for forty-eight years first.' And the new doctor said, 'Okay. I'll do it.'

"So they went to the king together, and the new doctor started showing the king what he knew—how to heal, how to govern, how to see what's real. And the king realized: 'This old doctor's a fool.' So he kicked the old doctor out and kept the new one.

"Then the new doctor said to the king, 'I need you to do something for me. Ban milk. Make it illegal. Anybody who drinks milk as medicine—cut off their head.'

"And the king said, 'Done.' He made the law.

"The new doctor started giving people real medicine—bitter, salty, sour, sweet, all mixed up just right for each person's sickness. And people got healed.

"But then the king got sick. And the new doctor looked at him and said, 'You need to drink milk.'

"The king said, 'What? You told me milk was poison! You made me ban it! Now you're telling me to drink it? Are you crazy? You trying to kill me? Maybe that old doctor was right after all!'

"And the new doctor said, 'Listen, King. Milk can be poison. Milk can be medicine. It depends.

"'If the cow eats trash, if she runs around wild, if she's not cared for right—that milk's poison.

"'But if the cow's healthy, if she eats clean, if she's calm and well-kept—that milk's medicine. The best medicine.

"'The old doctor didn't know the difference. He just gave milk to everybody. That's why I banned it—to stop him from killing people.

"'But now you need it. So drink it.'

"And the king drank it, and he was healed.

"Then the king made a new law: 'Everybody can drink milk again.'

"And the people got mad. They said, 'What's going on? First he says it's poison, now he says it's medicine? Is the king crazy?'

"But the king said, 'Don't be mad at me. I'm just listening to the doctor. He knows what he's doing.'

"And the people understood. And they honored the doctor. And everybody who was sick drank the right milk and got healed."

### The Lord's Explanation

Then the Lord said:

"I'm that doctor. I came into the world to heal you. And the first thing I had to do was stop the poison.

"The outsiders—the Brahmins, the philosophers—they were teaching 'self.' But the self they taught was fake. It was the ego. It was pride. It was 'I'm better than you, I'm gonna live forever, I'm the center of the universe.' That's poison. That's what keeps you on the wheel.

"So I said, 'No self. No person. No ego. No soul. No agent. No experiencer.' I banned the poison.

"And it worked. People stopped clinging to the ego. They got free.

"But now I'm telling you: **There IS a Self.**

"Not the fake self. The real Self.

"The fake self is what ordinary folks think: 'It's as big as my thumb,' or 'It's tiny like a seed,' or 'It's a little spark inside me.' That's all nonsense.

"The real Self is this: **What's real. What's true. What lasts. What's sovereign. What you can depend on. What don't change.**

"That's the Self. That's the Buddha-nature. That's what you are.

"I taught 'no-self' to train you, to break your pride, to get you off the wheel. That was the right medicine at the right time.

"But now I'm teaching you the truth: **In all things, there's a real Self. And you gotta know it.**

"You four groups—monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen—this is what you gotta practice. This is the real deal."

## THE ATMOSPHERE

**The Moan:**  
The moan here is confusion. Deep confusion. The monks thought they had it figured out. They practiced impermanence, suffering, no-self. They thought that was the whole truth. And now the Lord's saying, "You got it backwards." That's disorienting. That's scary. It's like finding out the map you've been following is upside down. The moan is the sound of everything you thought you knew falling apart.

**The Turnaround:**  
The turnaround is the revelation: **There IS permanence. There IS bliss. There IS self. There IS purity.** Not the fake kind the world clings to, but the real kind. The Dharma-Body that don't change. The *nirvāṇa* that's true peace. The Buddha-nature that's your real self. The Dharma that's pure. The turnaround is the moment you realize: The Lord wasn't taking something away. He was clearing the ground so He could give you something real.

**The Sound:**  
This should be read like a revelation. Start slow, with the monks' confusion. Let that sit. Then, when the Lord starts correcting them—"You got it backwards"—let that land hard. Repeat it. Emphasize it. And when He reveals the truth—"Self is the Tathāgata. Permanence is the Dharma-Body. Bliss is *nirvāṇa*. Purity is the Dharma"—let that ring out like a bell. This is the secret. This is what the whole thing's been building toward. Let it shine.

## Key Terms (Endnotes for Learners)

**The Four Inversions (四顛倒)**  
"Inversion" means seeing things upside down, backwards, inside out. The Lord teaches there's **two sets** of inversions—two ways of getting it wrong.

**First set (ordinary people):**
1. Seeing what don't last (like the body) and thinking it's permanent
2. Seeing what's suffering (like pleasure) and thinking it's bliss
3. Seeing what ain't you (like the ego) and thinking it's your self
4. Seeing what's impure (like this world) and thinking it's pure

That's how the world gets it wrong. They cling to the body, chase pleasure, worship the ego, think this life is all there is.

**Second set (the monks):**
1. Seeing what DOES last (the Dharma-Body) and thinking it's temporary
2. Seeing what IS bliss (*nirvāṇa*) and thinking it's just the end of suffering
3. Seeing what IS the true Self (Buddha-nature) and thinking there's no self at all
4. Seeing what IS pure (the Dharma) and thinking it's impure

That's how the monks get it wrong. They think *nirvāṇa* is annihilation. They think there's no true Self. They think everything's impermanent.

The truth is in the middle: The world's wrong. The monks are wrong. The real truth is **permanence, bliss, self, and purity**—but the **real** kind, not the fake kind.

**Permanence, Bliss, Self, Purity (常樂我淨)**  
This is the big teaching. This is what the Nirvana Sutra is famous for.

- **Permanence (常):** The Dharma-Body don't change. It don't arise. It don't cease. It's eternal. That's real permanence.
- **Bliss (樂):** *Nirvāṇa* ain't just the end of suffering. It's positive peace. It's joy. It's rest. That's real bliss.
- **Self (我):** There's a true Self—not the ego, but the Buddha-nature. It's real, true, permanent, sovereign, dependable, unchanging. That's the real Self.
- **Purity (淨):** The Dharma is pure. The Buddha's teaching is unstained. That's real purity.

The Lord taught "impermanence, suffering, no-self, impurity" first because people were clinging to the wrong things. He had to break that clinging. But now He's revealing the ultimate truth: There IS something that lasts, something that's bliss, something that's your true Self, something that's pure. And that's what you gotta realize.

**Worldly vs. Transcendent (世間 vs. 出世間)**  
The Lord makes a distinction:

- **Worldly (世間):** Ordinary folks use the words "permanent, bliss, self, pure," but they're talking about the body, pleasure, the ego, this life. **They got the words, but not the meaning.** It's like calling fool's gold "gold"—you're using the right word, but you're pointing at the wrong thing.

- **Transcendent (出世間):** The Buddhas and Bodhisattvas use the same words—"permanent, bliss, self, pure"—but they're talking about the Dharma-Body, *nirvāṇa*, Buddha-nature, the Dharma. **They got the words AND the meaning.** They're pointing at the real gold.

So when the Lord says "there's a Self," He ain't talking about the ego. He's talking about the Buddha-nature. When He says "there's permanence," He ain't talking about the body. He's talking about the Dharma-Body. Same words, different meaning.

**The Parable of the Milk Medicine**  
This parable is about skillful means. The Lord taught "no-self" first because people were clinging to the ego. That teaching was like banning milk—it stopped the poison (ego-attachment) from spreading.

But now He's teaching "true Self" because people are ready. That's like prescribing milk when it's the right medicine.

The point: The Lord's teaching changes based on what you need. Early on, you need to hear "no-self" to break your pride. Later, you need to hear "true Self" to realize your Buddha-nature. Both teachings are true. Both are medicine. You just gotta know when to take which one.

## Lotus Sutra Connections

### The Bluesman's Take

This teaching—**permanence, bliss, self, purity**—is the Nirvana Sutra's way of explaining what the Lotus Sutra revealed in **Chapter 16**: **The Buddha is eternal.**

In Lotus Chapter 16, the Lord says, "Y'all think I just got enlightened under the Bodhi tree? Nah. I been enlightened for countless ages. I been free forever. My *parinirvāṇa*? That's just theater. That's skillful means. I ain't really dying. I'm eternal."

The Nirvana Sutra takes that and says, "Okay, but what does 'eternal' mean? What's the nature of that eternal Buddha?" And the answer is: **Permanence, Bliss, Self, Purity.**

- **Permanence:** The Dharma-Body don't change. The Lord's been enlightened forever, and He'll be enlightened forever. That's Lotus Chapter 16.
- **Bliss:** *Nirvāṇa* ain't annihilation. It's peace. It's joy. It's rest. The Lord's been in that state forever.
- **Self:** The Buddha-nature is the true Self. It's real, unchanging, dependable. That's what the Lord is. That's what you are.
- **Purity:** The Dharma is pure. The Lord's teaching is unstained. That's what He's been teaching for countless ages.

The Lotus Sutra says the Buddha is eternal. The Nirvana Sutra says what that eternity looks like.

And that parable of the physician and the milk? That's the same structure as the Parable of the Excellent Physician in **Lotus Chapter 16**. In that parable, the doctor's kids drink poison. He makes an antidote, but some kids won't take it because they're too messed up. So he pretends to die. He sends word: "Your father's dead." And when the kids hear that, they panic, and they take the medicine, and they're healed.

The Nirvana Sutra's parable works the same way:
- The old doctor (the outsiders) gives bad medicine (the teaching of ego-self).
- The new doctor (the Buddha) bans that medicine (teaches no-self).
- Later, the new doctor prescribes the right medicine (teaches true Self).

Both parables teach: **The Buddha's teaching changes based on what you need.** Early on, you need to hear "no-self" to break your ego. Later, you need to hear "true Self" to realize your Buddha-nature. It's all medicine. It's all skillful means.

And that image of the drunk person seeing the sun and moon spin? That's the same as **Lotus Chapter 3**, the Parable of the Burning House. The kids in the burning house don't see the danger. Their perception is inverted. They think they're safe when they're in danger.

The Nirvana Sutra says: **Everybody's perception is inverted.** Ordinary folks see permanence in the body (which is temporary). Monks see impermanence in the Dharma-Body (which is eternal). Both are drunk. Both are seeing things spin that ain't spinning.

The cure? **Wake up. Sober up. See what's real.**

And what's real is this: **Permanence, Bliss, Self, Purity.** Not the fake kind. The real kind.

That's the Lotus Sutra. That's the Nirvana Sutra. Same truth, different angles.
