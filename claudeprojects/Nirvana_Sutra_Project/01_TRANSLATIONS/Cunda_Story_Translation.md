**"Cunda's Prayer"**

Lord, I'm asking you to take what little I got.
I ain't got much—broke as I ever been, ain't got a pot.
But please, Lord, come down to my door like a man diving deep for pearls in the sea—
Even though all I got is dust and pennies, won't you treat it like treasure when you look at me?

Lord, come to my table like a daddy coming home to his only boy,
The one he'd give the world for, the one who brings him joy.
I'm poor, I'm empty, got nothing worth your time,
But if you'll take this offering, Lord, you make this worthless life of mine shine.
