## Classical Chinese Source Text (Lines 63-95)

**Line 63 - Buddha's Prose Introduction:**
佛告純陀：「如是如是，如汝所說。佛出世難如優曇花，值佛生信亦復甚難，佛臨涅槃最後施食，能具足檀[3]復倍甚難。汝今純陀！莫大愁苦，應生踊躍，喜自慶幸，得值最後供養如來，成就具足檀波羅蜜，不應請佛久住於世。汝今當觀諸佛境界，悉皆無常，諸行性相，亦復如是。即為純陀而說偈言：

**Lines 65-95 - Buddha's Verse on Impermanence:**

「一切諸世間，  \t生者皆歸死，
壽命雖無量，  \t要必當有盡。
夫盛必有衰，  \t合會有別離，
壯年不久停，  \t盛色病所侵，
命為死所吞，  \t無有法常者。
諸王得自在，  \t勢力無等雙，
一切皆遷動，  \t壽命亦如是。
眾苦輪無際，  \t流轉無休息，
三界皆無常，  \t諸有無有樂。
有道本性相，  \t一切皆空無，
可壞法流[4]轉，  \t常有憂患等。
恐怖諸過[5]惡，  \t老病死衰惱，
是諸無有邊，  \t易壞怨所侵。
煩惱所纏裹，  \t猶如蠶處繭，
何有智慧者，  \t而當樂是處？
此身苦所集，  \t一切皆不淨，
[6]扼縛癰瘡等，  \t根本無義利。
上至諸天身，  \t皆亦復如是，
諸欲皆無常，  \t故我不貪著。
離欲善思惟，  \t而證於真實，
究竟斷有者，  \t今日當涅槃。
我度有彼岸，  \t已得過諸苦，
是故於今[7]者，  \t純受上妙樂。
以是因緣故，  \t證無戲論邊，
永斷諸纏縛，  \t今日入涅槃。
我無老病死，  \t壽命不可盡，
我今入涅槃，  \t猶如大火滅。
純陀汝不應，  \t思量如來義，
當觀如來[8]住，  \t猶如須彌山。
我今[9]入涅槃，  \t受[10]於第一樂，
諸佛法如是，  \t不應復[11]啼哭。」

即為純陀而說偈言 (jí wèi chún tuó ér shuō jì yán) - "immediately for Cunda speaking verse saying"

**Literal translation:**

"The Buddha told Cunda: 'So it is, so it is, as you have said. A Buddha appearing in the world is difficult, like the udumbara flower. Encountering a Buddha and generating faith is also again extremely difficult. [When] the Buddha is approaching nirvāṇa, [to make] the final food offering and be able to perfect giving is again doubly extremely difficult.

You now, Cunda! Do not greatly grieve and suffer. You should produce leaping joy, joyfully congratulate yourself on [your] good fortune—obtaining [the opportunity of] encountering [and making] the final offering to the Tathāgata, accomplishing and perfecting the perfection of giving.

[You] should not request the Buddha to long dwell in the world. You now should contemplate the Buddhas' sphere—all [is] entirely impermanent. All conditioned things' nature and characteristics are also again like this.'

[The Buddha] immediately for Cunda spoke verses saying:"

**Key terms:**
- **諸佛境界** - The Buddhas' sphere/domain; the realm of enlightened experience
- **諸行 (saṃskāra)** - All conditioned/compounded things
- **性相** - Nature and characteristics; essential nature and manifest form

**Scholarly notes:**
The Buddha affirms Cunda's statement about the rarity of this opportunity, but then redirects him: instead of asking Buddha to remain, Cunda should contemplate the fundamental truth that even "the Buddhas' sphere" is characterized by impermanence. This sets up the profound teaching in the verses that follow.

I now enter nirvāṇa,  
Just like a great fire being extinguished."

**Scholarly notes:**
Paradox: Buddha claims to be without old age, sickness, death, with inexhaustible lifespan—yet he's entering nirvāṇa. The "great fire extinguished" is the classic metaphor for nirvāṇa (literally "blown out").

---

[As] just like Mount Sumeru.

I now enter nirvāṇa,  
Receiving the first [supreme] bliss.

The Buddhas' dharma is like this—  
[You] should not again weep and cry."

**Key terms:**
- **思量** - To measure, calculate, conceptualize
- **須彌山 (Sumeru)** - Cosmic mountain; immovable, unshakeable
- **第一樂** - First/supreme bliss; nirvāṇa

**Scholarly notes:**
The Buddha tells Cunda not to try to "measure" or conceptualize what the Tathāgata truly is. Instead, contemplate him as immovable like Sumeru. The apparent contradiction (entering nirvāṇa yet being eternal like a mountain) points to the transcendence of conventional categories.

## Key Terms Breakdown

### The Professor's Philological Analysis

**1. 無常 (wú cháng) - Impermanence/Anitya**

- **Sanskrit:** *anitya* or *anityatā*
- **Literal meaning:** 無 (without/not) + 常 (permanent/constant)
- **Why this translation:** The character 常 (cháng) means "constant, permanent, eternal." By negating it with 無, Chinese translators created a precise equivalent to the Sanskrit *anitya*—the teaching that all conditioned phenomena are transient.
- **Doctrinal significance:** One of the three marks of existence (impermanence, suffering, no-self). The Buddha teaches this extensively before revealing his own eternity—a pedagogical sequence.

**2. 涅槃 (niè pán) - Nirvāṇa**

- **Sanskrit:** *nirvāṇa*
- **Literal meaning:** Phonetic approximation; 涅 (niè) + 槃 (pán) have no independent semantic meaning
- **Why this translation:** This is a pure phonetic rendering (*transliteration*) rather than semantic translation. The translators chose not to translate the meaning ("extinction," "blowing out") to preserve the term's technical precision and avoid misunderstanding.
- **Doctrinal significance:** The paradox of this section—the Buddha enters nirvāṇa ("like a great fire extinguished") yet claims to have "no old age, sickness, death" and "inexhaustible lifespan."

**3. 法身 (fǎ shēn) - Dharmakāya (Dharma-body)**

- **Sanskrit:** *dharmakāya*
- **Literal meaning:** 法 (dharma/truth/teaching) + 身 (body)
- **Why this translation:** 法 (fǎ) translates *dharma* (truth, teaching, reality). 身 (shēn) means "body." Together they convey the Buddha's "truth-body"—his eternal, unconditioned essence, as opposed to his physical manifestation body (*nirmāṇakāya*).
- **Doctrinal significance:** The Buddha's claim "I have no old age, sickness, death" refers to the dharmakāya, which is eternal and unconditioned, not the physical body which appears to die.

**4. 戲論 (xì lùn) - Prapañca (Conceptual Elaboration)**

- **Sanskrit:** *prapañca*
- **Literal meaning:** 戲 (play/game/drama) + 論 (discourse/discussion)
- **Why this translation:** The character 戲 (xì) means "play" or "theatrical performance," brilliantly capturing the Sanskrit *prapañca*—mental proliferation, conceptual elaboration, the "drama" the mind creates. It's the endless conceptual chatter that obscures direct perception of reality.
- **Doctrinal significance:** The Buddha says he has "realized the limit without conceptual elaboration"—he's beyond the mind's tendency to create concepts, categories, and distinctions.

## Lotus Sutra Connections

### The Professor's Cross-References

This section contains one of the central paradoxes shared by both the Nirvana and Lotus Sutras:

**1. The Paradox: Impermanence Teaching from the Eternal Buddha**

The Buddha teaches universal impermanence ("all who are born return to death," "no dharma is permanent") yet simultaneously claims to be eternal ("I have no old age, sickness, death; my lifespan cannot be exhausted"). This paradox is resolved in:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 16 (Lifespan of the Tathāgata)**: The Buddha reveals he attained enlightenment "countless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of nayutas of kalpas ago." His apparent death is upāya (skillful means) to prevent beings from becoming complacent.

**2. "Like a Great Fire Extinguished" (猶如大火滅)**

The metaphor of nirvāṇa as a great fire being extinguished appears in both sutras:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 3 (Parable of the Burning House)**: The three vehicles are expedient means to lead beings out of the burning house of saṃsāra. The fire represents afflictions.
- Here in Nirvana Sutra: The Buddha entering nirvāṇa is "like a great fire extinguished"—but he immediately clarifies he has "no old age, sickness, death," revealing the apparent extinction is itself upāya.

**3. "Don't Try to Measure the Tathāgata" (純陀汝不應思量如來義)**

The Buddha tells Cunda not to try to "measure" or conceptualize what the Tathāgata truly is. This teaching on the inconceivability of Buddha-wisdom appears throughout the Lotus:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 2 (Skillful Means)**: "The wisdom of the Buddhas is infinitely profound and immeasurable... difficult to understand, difficult to enter."
- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 7 (The Parable of the Phantom City)**: The Buddha's lifespan and true nature transcend ordinary calculation.

**4. "Contemplate the Tathāgata Like Mount Sumeru" (當觀如來住猶如須彌山)**

The image of the Buddha as immovable like Mount Sumeru (the cosmic mountain) while simultaneously entering nirvāṇa parallels:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 16**: The Buddha is simultaneously present and absent, eternal yet appearing to die. Like Sumeru, he is the stable axis around which the world turns, yet he skillfully appears to move (be born, die) for pedagogical purposes.

**5. The Silkworm Simile (煩惱所纏裹，猶如蠶處繭)**

The image of beings wrapped in afflictions like a silkworm in its cocoon connects to:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 4 (Belief and Understanding)**: The parable of the poor son who doesn't recognize his own father (the Buddha) and remains in poverty (saṃsāra) despite being the heir to infinite wealth (Buddha-nature).

**6. "Receiving Supreme Wonderful Bliss" (純受上妙樂)**

The Buddha's claim to be "purely receiving supreme wonderful bliss" in nirvāṇa while teaching impermanence and suffering relates to:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 16**: The Buddha dwells in the "tranquil light" (寂光) of true reality while appearing to engage in birth and death. His true state is eternal bliss, but he manifests suffering to teach beings.

**7. The Teaching Sequence: Impermanence → Eternal**

The Buddha first teaches impermanence extensively, then reveals his own eternity. This pedagogical sequence mirrors:

- **Lotus Sutra's structure**: Early teachings (Hīnayāna) emphasize impermanence, suffering, no-self. Later revelation (Mahāyāna) discloses the eternal Buddha, Buddha-nature, and the One Vehicle.
- This is the "opening of the provisional to reveal the real" (開權顯實) that characterizes both sutras.

**8. "Buddhas' Dharma Is Like This" (諸佛法如是)**

The Buddha's statement that "the Buddhas' dharma is like this" (appearing to die while being eternal) is the core teaching of:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 16**: All Buddhas use the same skillful means—appearing to enter nirvāṇa to inspire urgency in practitioners, while actually dwelling eternally in the dharma-realm.

---

**Doctrinal Synthesis:**

Both the Nirvana and Lotus Sutras teach the "eternal Buddha" (常住佛) doctrine, which revolutionized Mahāyāna Buddhism. The apparent contradiction—teaching impermanence while being eternal—is resolved through the two-truth framework:

- **Conventional truth**: All conditioned phenomena are impermanent (including the Buddha's physical manifestation)
- **Ultimate truth**: The Buddha's dharmakāya (dharma-body) is eternal, unconditioned, beyond birth and death

The Lotus Sutra emphasizes the Buddha's eternal presence and the One Vehicle. The Nirvana Sutra deepens this by introducing Buddha-nature (佛性) as the eternal essence present in all beings.
