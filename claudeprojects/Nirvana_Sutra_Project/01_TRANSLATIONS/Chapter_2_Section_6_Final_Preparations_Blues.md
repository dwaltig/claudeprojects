## "It's Time" (The Last Meal and the Earthquake)

### Part 1: The Lord Says It's Time

The Lord looked at Cunda and said:

"The food you prepared, the offering you made for me and the assembly—**it's time now**. Give it.

I'm about to enter nirvana. **Right now.**"

He said it once. He said it twice. He said it a third time.

---

### Part 2: Cunda Breaks Down

When Cunda heard that, he **lost it**. He started crying out loud, sobbing, saying:

"**This is suffering! This is suffering!**  
**The world's about to be empty!**"

Then he turned to everybody there and said:

"All of us—**right now**—we need to throw ourselves on the ground. All of us together. We gotta beg the Lord not to leave. **Don't enter nirvana, Lord. Please.**"

---

### Part 3: The Lord's Teaching on Impermanence (Again)

The Lord looked at Cunda and said:

"Stop crying. Don't let your heart waste away with grief.

Listen to me:

Look at this body. **Really look at it.**

It's like a **banana tree**—looks solid, but when you peel it, there's nothing inside.

It's like **heat waves** shimmering on a hot day—looks like water, but it ain't real.

It's like a **water bubble**—here one second, gone the next.

It's like an **illusion**, a magic trick.

It's like a **mirage city**—the kind spirits build in the sky that disappears when you get close.

It's like a **broken pot**—cracked, can't hold water.

It's like **lightning**—flash, then darkness.

It's like **drawing on water**—the line disappears as soon as you make it.

It's like a **prisoner on death row**—time's running out.

It's like **ripe fruit**—about to fall.

It's like **meat on a hook**—gonna rot.

It's like **thread on a loom**—running out, almost done.

It's like a **pestle going up and down**—just keeps pounding till it's over.

Look at all conditioned things like **food mixed with poison**. Looks good, but it'll kill you.

**Conditioned existence is full of faults, full of suffering.**"

---

### Part 4: Cunda Can't Stop Crying

Cunda said:

"Lord, if You don't want to stay in this world, **how can I not cry?**

**This is suffering! This is suffering!  
The world's about to be empty!**

Please, Lord, have mercy on me, on all of us, on all beings. **Stay in this world. Don't enter nirvana.**"

---

### Part 5: The Lord's Final Teaching (The Famous Verse)

The Lord said:

"Cunda, you shouldn't be saying that—asking me to stay out of pity for you.

**I'm entering nirvana because I have pity for you and all beings.**

Why? **Because that's the Buddhas' dharma.** That's how conditioned things work.

That's why all Buddhas teach this verse:

---

**'All conditioned things—  
Their nature is impermanent.  
Once born, they don't stay.  
Extinction is bliss.'**

---

Cunda, look at all conditioned things, all dharmas: **No self. Impermanent. Don't last.**

This body's got countless faults. It's like a water bubble.

So Cunda, **you shouldn't be crying.**"

---

### Part 6: Cunda Understands (But Still Hurts)

Cunda said:

"Yes, Lord. Yes. You're right. I know You're right.

I know the Lord's just **showing** us, using skillful means, appearing to enter nirvana. I know that.

But I still can't help feeling this pain, this sorrow.

And then I think about it, and I feel **joy** again."

---

### Part 7: The Lord Praises Cunda

The Lord said:

"**Well done, Cunda! Well done!**

You understand that the Lord appears the same as all beings, using skillful means, appearing to enter nirvana.

Now listen, Cunda:

It's like the **śāla-śāla birds**. In the spring, they all gather at Lake Anavatapta. **All the Buddhas are like that**—they all come to this place.

Cunda, you shouldn't be thinking about whether Buddhas live long or short. **All dharmas are like illusions.** The Lord's in the middle of it all, using skillful means, not attached to anything.

Why? **Because that's the Buddhas' dharma.**

Cunda, I'm receiving your offering now—**to help you cross over the ocean of birth and death, to escape the flow of existence.**

Whoever makes this final offering to me—whether human or god—they're all gonna get **unshakeable results**, constant peace and happiness.

Why? **Because I'm a good field for beings to plant their merit.**

If you want to be a field of merit for all beings, **hurry up and give your offering. Don't wait.**"

---

### Part 8: Cunda's Humble Response

Cunda—wanting all beings to be liberated—bowed his head, **swallowed his tears**, and said:

"Lord, if I'm worthy to be a field of merit, then I could understand the Lord's nirvana and non-nirvana.

But me? And all the voice-hearers and solitary-realizers? Our wisdom's like **mosquitoes and ants**. We can't measure the Lord's nirvana or non-nirvana. We just can't."

---

### Part 9: They Leave to Prepare the Meal

Then Cunda and his family—sad, crying, grieving—they surrounded the Lord. They burned incense, scattered flowers, gave everything they had in respect.

Then Cunda and Mañjuśrī got up from their seats and left to go prepare the food.

---

### Part 10: The Great Earthquake

They hadn't been gone long when **the earth started shaking**.

Not just a little shake. **A great earthquake.**

The whole earth. All the way up to the Brahma world. **Everything shook.**

---

**Now, there's two kinds of earthquakes:**

1. **Small earthquake** (地動) - Just the ground shakes a little
2. **Great earthquake** (大地動) - Everything shakes

Here's how you tell the difference:

- **Small sound** = earthquake
- **Big sound** = great earthquake

- **Just the ground shakes** = earthquake  
- **Mountains, rivers, trees, ocean—everything shakes** = great earthquake

- **Shakes in one direction** = earthquake  
- **Spins around, whirls** = great earthquake

- **Just shakes** = earthquake  
- **Shakes so hard it makes people's hearts shake** = great earthquake

---

**When does a great earthquake happen?**

Six times:

1. When a **bodhisattva comes down from Tuṣita Heaven** to be born in this world
2. When he's **born**
3. When he **leaves home** (renounces)
4. When he **attains supreme enlightenment**
5. When he **turns the wheel of dharma** (teaches)
6. When he **enters nirvana**

**Today, the Lord's about to enter nirvana. That's why the earth's shaking like this.**

---

## THE ATMOSPHERE

**The Moan:** Cunda's desperate, crying, begging. "Don't leave! The world's gonna be empty!" The Lord keeps teaching impermanence—banana trees, water bubbles, prisoners on death row. It's relentless. The suffering's real.

**The Turnaround:** Cunda understands (intellectually) but still hurts (emotionally). The Lord praises him for that. Then the earthquake—the whole cosmos responding to the Lord's departure. It's not just personal grief anymore. **The universe itself is mourning.**

**The Sound:** This should sound like a funeral. Slow, heavy, mournful. The famous verse ("All conditioned things are impermanent") should be sung like a hymn—simple, profound, final. Then the earthquake description should build in intensity, like thunder rolling.

---

## Key Terms (Endnotes for Learners)

**Conditioned Things (有為之法)**  
Things that are "made," "put together," "fabricated." They got a beginning, so they got an end. The banana tree, the water bubble, the lightning—all conditioned. They arise, they pass away. That's their nature.

**The Famous Verse (有為之法，其性無常)**  
"All conditioned things—their nature is impermanent. Once born, they don't stay. Extinction is bliss."

This is one of the most famous verses in all of Buddhism. It's the **core teaching**: Everything changes. Nothing lasts. And the end of suffering (extinction/nirvana) is **bliss**, not tragedy.

**Skillful Means (方便)**  
The Lord "appearing" to enter nirvana is skillful means. He's not really dying (He's eternal), but He's **showing** death to teach us urgency. Like a father pretending to leave so his kids learn to stand on their own.

**Field of Merit (福田)**  
A "field" where you plant good deeds and harvest good results. The Buddha's the ultimate field—any offering to Him produces infinite merit. Cunda's offering the final meal, so he's planting in the best field there is.

**The Six Great Earthquakes**  
The cosmos responds to the Buddha's key life moments:
1. Descending from heaven
2. Birth
3. Renunciation
4. Enlightenment
5. First teaching
6. **Nirvana** (happening now)

The earth shaking means: **This ain't just a man dying. This is cosmic.**

**Śāla-Śāla Birds at Lake Anavatapta**  
Mythical birds that gather at a sacred lake in spring. The Lord's saying: "Just like those birds gather at that lake, all Buddhas come to this moment—the moment of apparent nirvana." It's a natural cycle, not a tragedy.

## Lotus Sutra Connections

### The Bluesman's Take

**"All Conditioned Things Are Impermanent"**

This verse is the **provisional teaching**—the first truth you gotta learn. Everything dies. Nothing lasts.

But **Lotus Chapter 16** reveals the **ultimate truth**: The Buddha's eternal. He's not subject to this law of impermanence.

So why's He teaching it? **Skillful means.** First you gotta understand that the world is impermanent. **Then** you can handle the truth that the Buddha transcends it.

**"Skillful Means Nirvana"**

When Cunda says "I know the Lord's using skillful means, appearing to enter nirvana," he's got it. That's **Lotus Chapter 16** in a nutshell:

The Buddha's not really dying. He's **appearing** to die to:
- Prevent beings from getting lazy
- Create urgency in practice
- Show that even Buddhas follow the dharma

It's like the **Excellent Physician parable** (Lotus Chapter 16): The father pretends to die so his poisoned children will take the medicine. The "death" is fake, but the healing is real.

**"The Great Earthquake"**

The cosmos shaking at the Buddha's key moments shows: **This ain't ordinary**. The Buddha's life events are **cosmic events**.

**Lotus Chapter 1** opens with the Buddha emitting light and the earth trembling—signs that something profound's about to happen.

Here, the earthquake signals: "The show's ending. The eternal Buddha's withdrawing His visible presence."

**"I'm Entering Nirvana Out of Compassion"**

The Lord says: "I'm entering nirvana **because** I have compassion for you, not in spite of it."

That's **Lotus Chapter 16**: "If I stayed visible forever, you'd get complacent. So I appear to die to light a fire under you."

The departure is the teaching. The absence creates the longing. The longing drives the practice.
