## "Cunda's Last Meal"

### Part 1: The Blacksmith Comes Forward

Now listen here.

There was this man in the assembly—a working man, a blacksmith's boy from Kuśinagara, name of Cunda. He wasn't nobody special, just a craftsman trying to make it, and he brought fifteen of his people with him.

And when Cunda heard the Lord was fixing to leave—I mean really leave, pass on into that final rest—something broke open in that man's chest.

He stood up from where he was sitting. Took off his shirt from one shoulder, the way you do when you're showing respect. Got down on one knee like a man proposing or begging for his life. Put his hands together. And he wept.

I'm talking about **wept**—tears running down his face, his whole body shaking. He bowed his head down to the Lord's feet, and through his crying, he said:

---

### Part 2: "Lord, Take What Little I Got"

"Lord, please—I'm begging you and all these monks—please take this last meal I brought. Take it for the sake of all the people who gonna be lost when you gone.

Lord, we ain't got nothing now. No master, no family to turn to, no rescue coming, no protection, nowhere to go, nothing to hope for. We **broke**. We **hungry**. We hurting.

And we trying to get some food from you—not food for the belly, but food for what's coming, food for the future when you ain't here no more.

Please, Lord. Have mercy on us. Take this little bit I got, and **then** you can go. But not before. Not till you eat what I brought.

---

### Part 3: The Farmer's Prayer

Lord, it's like this:

Say a man—don't matter if he's rich or poor, high-born or low—say he's so broke he got to leave home, go way out to some other country just to find work. And he's out there in the fields, working somebody else's land.

But he got himself some good strong oxen, trained up right. And he got himself a good piece of ground—level, clean, no rocks, no weeds, no stumps to break the plow. Everything's ready.

All he needs now is **rain**.

Lord, them oxen—that's my body and my mouth doing right. That good clean field—that's whatever little bit of wisdom I got. Getting rid of them rocks and weeds—that's me trying to clear out all the mess in my heart, all the anger and the wanting.

Lord, I got the oxen. I got the field. I done cleared the ground.

**All I need is your rain.**

I'm that broke farmer, Lord. I'm poor in the only thing that matters—I ain't got the dharma, the truth, the treasure that don't rust. 

Please, have mercy. End this poverty. Not just for me—for all the suffering people out here.

What I brought ain't much. Probably ain't even enough to feed everybody. But I'm hoping—Lord, I'm **hoping**—it'll be enough for you and your people.

I got nobody now, Lord. No master, no family, nowhere to turn.

Treat me like you treated your own boy Rāhula. That's all I'm asking."

### Part 4: The Lord Speaks

And the Lord—the one who knows everything, the one who can tame any wild heart—he looked at Cunda and said:

"**Well done, son. Well done.**

I'm gonna end your poverty right now. I'm gonna rain down the dharma on your field, and it's gonna grow. You gonna see sprouts coming up where there was nothing before.

You asking me for long life, for strength, for peace, for the right words to say? I'm gonna give you **eternal** life. Eternal strength. Eternal peace. And words that can't be stopped.

You know why?

Because, Cunda—listen to me now—there's two meals that matter. Two offerings that count the same, that give the same reward.

**First meal:** The one I ate before I woke up, before I got free. After I ate that, I became the Buddha.

**Second meal:** The one I'm about to eat now, your meal. After I eat this, I'm going into that final rest, that nirvana.

Both the same, Cunda. Both worth the same.

I'm taking your offering right now, and it's gonna make you **complete** in giving. You gonna be perfected in generosity, son."

---

### Part 5: Cunda Ain't Buying It

Now Cunda—he wasn't no fool. He heard what the Lord said, and he spoke right up:

"Lord, with all respect, that don't make no sense.

You saying them two meals are equal? They ain't equal. Let me tell you why:

**That first meal**—the one before you woke up—you still had all that mess in you. You hadn't cleared it all out yet. You wasn't all-knowing yet. You couldn't make other people perfect in giving yet.

**This second meal**—the one I'm offering now—you already cleaned out. You already know everything. You **can** make people perfect.

That first time, you was just a man trying to get free.  
This time, you **the Lord of lords**.

That first time, you had a regular body—a body that needed food, that had troubles in it, that was gonna die one more time.  
This time, you got a body with no troubles, a diamond body, a dharma body, a body that lasts forever, a body with no limits.

How you gonna tell me them two meals are the same?

That first time, you hadn't perfected all them virtues yet—the giving, the morality, the patience, the effort, the meditation, the wisdom. You only had regular human eyes.  
This time, you got Buddha-eyes. You got wisdom-eyes. You can see **everything**.

How you gonna tell me them two meals are the same?

Lord, that first time, you **ate**. Food went in your belly, got digested, gave you life and strength and color and peace and the right words.  
This time, you ain't gonna eat. You ain't gonna digest nothing. You ain't gonna get none of them five things from it.

**So how you gonna tell me them two meals are the same?**"

### Part 6: The Lord's Deep Teaching

The Lord said:

"Son, listen.

I been free for longer than you can count. For more lifetimes than there are grains of sand, I ain't had no food-body, no trouble-body, no 'last body.' I got an eternal body, a dharma body, a diamond body.

Here's what you need to understand:

**Anybody who ain't seen their Buddha-nature yet**—they got a trouble-body, a food-body, a 'last body.'

But that man—that seeker, that bodhisattva—when he ate that first meal, he went into the deepest meditation there is, the diamond meditation. And when that food finished digesting, **he saw his Buddha-nature**. Right then, he woke up. He became the Buddha.

**That's why them two meals are equal.**

That seeker back then, he destroyed the four demons—the demon of wanting, the demon of the body, the demon of death, the demon of pride.  
Now, going into nirvana, I'm destroying them same four demons again.

**That's why them two meals are equal.**

That seeker back then, he already knew all the teachings, even though he wasn't preaching them wide yet.  
Now, going into nirvana, I'm preaching them wide for everybody.

**That's why them two meals are equal.**

And Cunda—here's the real truth:

My body ain't eaten food in more lifetimes than you can imagine. When I told my disciples I ate that milk-rice from them two cowherd girls before I woke up—**I didn't really eat it**. That was just a story for them to understand.

And now, I'm taking your offering for the sake of this whole assembly—**but I ain't really gonna eat it either**.

It's all for **you**, Cunda. For your completion. For your freedom."

## THE ATMOSPHERE

**The Moan:** A working man facing the loss of everything—his teacher, his hope, his future. The desperation of poverty, not just in money but in spirit. The fear of being left alone in a hard world.

**The Turnaround:** The Lord doesn't just accept the offering—he reveals that the offering itself makes Cunda complete. The meal doesn't feed the Buddha; it **frees the giver**. And the deep teaching: there never was a "before" and "after" enlightenment. The Buddha's been free all along. Time collapses. The struggle was always already the victory.

**The Sound:** This should be read slow, with pauses. Like Lightnin' Hopkins talking between verses. The sorrow has to land before the revelation can lift you up.

## Key Terms (Endnotes for Learners)

**Buddha-Nature (佛性)**  
Your true self. Not something you gotta get—something you **already got** but don't know it yet. Like a poor man with a diamond sewn into his coat lining. He's rich, but he don't know it, so he keeps begging. Buddha-nature is that diamond. You already enlightened—you just gotta realize it.

**Perfection of Giving (檀波羅蜜)**  
Generosity so complete it carries you to the other shore (liberation). Not just giving stuff away—giving with **no strings attached**, no ego, no "look what I did." Cunda perfected this when he offered his last meal to the Lord. The offering itself made him complete.

**Conditioned vs. Unconditioned (有為法 vs. 無為法)**  
- **Conditioned** = Things that are put together, made, fabricated. They got a beginning, so they got an end. Like a sandcastle—built up, washed away.
- **Unconditioned** = Things that ain't made, that don't change, that last forever. Truth. The dharma-body. What's real.

The big question in this sutra: Is the Lord conditioned (gonna die like everything else) or unconditioned (eternal)? Answer: **Unconditioned**. He's always been free.

**Skillful Means (方便)**  
The Lord's teaching methods—adapted to who He's talking to. Like a doctor giving different medicine to different patients. The medicine ain't the same, but the goal is: **heal the sickness**. The Lord's whole life story (birth, enlightenment, death) is skillful means—a show put on for our benefit, not because He needed it.

## Lotus Sutra Connections

### The Bluesman's Take

Brother, if you know the Lotus Sutra, you're gonna recognize these truths—just told a different way:

**1. "The Two Meals Are Equal"**

When the Lord says the meal before He woke up and the meal before He leaves are worth the same—that's the **same teaching as Lotus Chapter 16**.

In the Lotus, the Lord reveals He's been awake for countless ages. That "first meal" before enlightenment? He was already enlightened. The whole story under the Bodhi tree was **theater for our benefit**.

So both meals—one to the "seeker" and one to the "Buddha"—are really meals to the same eternal Lord. **That's why they're equal.**

**2. "I Never Really Ate"**

When the Lord says "I didn't actually eat either meal"—that's pure **Lotus Sutra Chapter 16** again.

The Lord's saying: My whole life story—being born, getting enlightened, teaching, dying—**it's all skillful means**. I been free forever. This whole drama is for **you**, not for me.

Like a father pretending to die so his kids will take their medicine (Lotus Chapter 16, the Physician parable). The eating, the not-eating—it's all part of the show.

**3. "The Dharma Rain"**

Cunda's metaphor about needing the Lord's "dharma rain" on his field—that's straight from **Lotus Chapter 5 (Medicinal Herbs)**.

Same image: The Lord's teaching falls like rain on all different plants. Each one drinks according to what it can hold. But it's **one rain**, one truth, falling on everybody.

**4. "Your Offering Makes You Perfect"**

When the Lord tells Cunda "Your offering perfects you in giving"—that's the **Lotus Sutra's teaching on merit** (Chapter 10 and throughout).

Even the smallest offering to the dharma—a flower, a song, a meal—creates **immeasurable merit**. Not because the offering is big, but because of **who you're offering it to**.

Cunda's poor man's meal becomes **priceless** because the Lord receives it.

**5. "I Been Free All Along"**

The whole teaching that the Lord never had afflictions, never had a "food body," been eternal forever—**that's the heart of Lotus Chapter 16**.

The Lord's not becoming free. He's **revealing** He's always been free. The struggle, the seeking, the enlightenment—all of it was **showing us the way**, not Him finding it.

---

**The Connection:**

Both sutras are teaching the same revolutionary truth: **The Buddha's eternal**. Not "becomes eternal" when He gets enlightened. **Always was, always will be.**

Everything else—the birth, the seeking, the enlightenment, the death—that's the **skillful means** (upāya) to meet us where we are.

The Lotus Sutra reveals it. The Nirvana Sutra deepens it. **Same truth, different angles.**
