**世尊！譬如有人，善學諸論，復於此論，而生怖畏。如來亦爾，通達諸法，而於諸法，復生怖畏。若使如來久住於世，說甘露味，充足一切，如是眾生則不復畏墮於地獄。**

**世尊！譬如醫王，善解方藥，偏以祕方教授其子，不教其餘外受學者。如來亦爾，獨以甚深祕密之藏，偏教文殊，遺棄我等，不見顧愍。如來於法應無慳悋，如彼醫王偏教其子，不教外來諸受學者。彼醫所以不能普教，情存勝負，故有祕惜。如來之心，終無勝負，何故如是，不見教誨？唯願久住，莫般涅槃。**

"World-Honored One! For example, like a king of physicians who skillfully understands medicinal formulas, exclusively teaching secret formulas to his son, not teaching the other outside students. The Tathāgata is also thus—only with the extremely profound secret treasury exclusively teaching Mañjuśrī, abandoning us, not looking upon us with compassion. The Tathāgata regarding the Dharma should have no stinginess, like that physician king exclusively teaching his son, not teaching the outside students who come to learn. That physician is unable to teach universally because his emotions harbor winning and losing, therefore he has secretiveness. The Tathāgata's mind ultimately has no winning or losing—why is it thus that you do not teach us? We only pray you dwell long and do not enter *parinirvāṇa*."

What is called 'the young' symbolizes those whose Dharma-body has not yet grown; 'the old' symbolizes heavy afflictions; 'the sick' symbolizes those not yet freed from birth and death; 'the dangerous road' symbolizes the twenty-five modes of existence.

## Key Terms Breakdown

### The Professor's Philological Analysis

**1. 八部眾 (bābù zhòng) - The Eight Classes of Beings**

- **Sanskrit:** *aṣṭau parṣadaḥ* (eight assemblies)
- **Literal meaning:** 八 (eight) + 部 (divisions/classes) + 眾 (assembly)
- **The eight classes:** devas (天), nāgas (龍), gandharvas (乾闥婆), asuras (阿修羅), garuḍas (迦樓羅), kinnaras (緊那羅), mahoragas (摩睺羅伽), humans and non-humans (人及非人)
- **Why this translation:** The character 部 (bù) means "division" or "category," reflecting the classification of different types of beings in the Buddhist cosmos. These eight classes represent the full spectrum of sentient beings who protect and receive the Dharma.
- **Doctrinal significance:** The presence of all eight classes at the Buddha's *parinirvāṇa* demonstrates the universal impact of the Buddha's teaching across all realms of existence. Their collective lament shows that suffering at the loss of the teacher transcends the boundaries between different types of beings.

**2. 法醫師 (fǎ yīshī) - Physician of the Dharma**

- **Sanskrit:** *dharmabhiṣaj* or *vaidyarāja* (king of physicians)
- **Literal meaning:** 法 (Dharma/teaching) + 醫師 (physician)
- **Why this translation:** The character 醫 (yī) means "to heal" or "physician," and 師 (shī) means "master" or "teacher." The compound emphasizes the Buddha's role as one who diagnoses and cures the diseases of affliction (*kleśa*). This medical metaphor is central to Buddhist soteriology—the Four Noble Truths follow the structure of medical diagnosis (disease, cause, cure, treatment).
- **Doctrinal significance:** This term appears in the assembly's lament to emphasize that without the Buddha, sentient beings will consume "wrong poisonous medicine" (邪毒藥)—that is, they will follow false teachings and harmful practices. The Buddha as physician treats the fundamental disease of ignorance.

**3. 二十五有 (èrshíwǔ yǒu) - Twenty-Five Modes of Existence**

- **Sanskrit:** *pañcaviṃśati bhava* (twenty-five becomings)
- **Literal meaning:** 二十五 (twenty-five) + 有 (existence/becoming)
- **Why this translation:** The character 有 (yǒu) translates Sanskrit *bhava*, meaning "existence" or "becoming." It refers to conditioned existence in *saṃsāra*. The number twenty-five represents a detailed classification of the realms of rebirth: 4 in the formless realm, 7 in the form realm, and 14 in the desire realm.
- **Doctrinal significance:** The twenty-five modes of existence represent the totality of *saṃsāric* existence—all the possible places of rebirth. The assembly uses this term to describe themselves as travelers on a "dangerous road" (險路), emphasizing their entrapment in cyclic existence and their desperate need for the Buddha's guidance to escape.

**4. 甘露 (gānlù) - Ambrosia/Nectar of Immortality**

- **Sanskrit:** *amṛta* (deathless, immortal)
- **Literal meaning:** 甘 (sweet) + 露 (dew)
- **Why this translation:** The Chinese translators chose 甘露 (sweet dew) to render *amṛta* because it evokes the life-giving, refreshing quality of the Buddha's teaching. In Vedic mythology, *amṛta* is the nectar of immortality obtained by the gods through churning the cosmic ocean. In Buddhism, it metaphorically refers to the Dharma that liberates beings from the death of *saṃsāra*.
- **Doctrinal significance:** The assembly pleads for the Buddha to remain in the world to "speak the taste of ambrosia" (說甘露味), meaning to continue teaching the Dharma that leads to liberation from death and rebirth. This connects to the Nirvana Sutra's central theme: true *nirvāṇa* is not annihilation but the deathless state of the Buddha's eternal Dharma-body.

## Lotus Sutra Connections

### The Professor's Cross-References

This passage of the assembly's lament contains several profound connections to the Lotus Sutra's central doctrines:

**1. The Eternal Buddha (Lotus Chapter 16: "Lifespan of the Tathāgata")**

The assembly's fear that the Buddha will "not return" (不還) and their plea for him to "dwell long in the world" (久住於世) directly parallels the teaching in Lotus Chapter 16, where the Buddha reveals that his *parinirvāṇa* is *upāya* (skillful means). The Buddha states: "Good sons, the Tathāgata, seeing that all beings delight in lesser teachings and are of slight virtue and heavy defilement, for such people I speak of *nirvāṇa* in my youth. But in truth, the Tathāgata does not actually enter extinction."

The Nirvana Sutra develops this doctrine further: the Buddha's "entering *nirvāṇa*" is a teaching device to create urgency in practitioners, but the Buddha's Dharma-body (法身) is eternal and unchanging.

**2. The Physician's Parable (Lotus Chapter 16)**

The assembly's metaphor of the Buddha as "Physician of the Dharma" (法醫師) and their concern about consuming "wrong poisonous medicine" (邪毒藥) directly echoes the Parable of the Excellent Physician in Lotus Chapter 16. In that parable, a physician's children consume poison in his absence. Upon his return, he prepares an antidote, but some children, their faculties impaired by poison, refuse to take it. The physician then uses the skillful means of pretending to die, which shocks the children into taking the medicine.

Similarly, in this passage, the assembly fears that without the Buddha's presence, beings will consume false teachings. The Buddha's response (entering *nirvāṇa*) is itself the "medicine" that creates the urgency needed for liberation.

**3. Universal Compassion and Non-Abandonment (Lotus Chapter 2: "Skillful Means")**

The assembly's plea "the Tathāgata should not abandon us" (不應見捨離) reflects the Lotus Sutra's teaching that the Buddha never abandons any sentient being. In Chapter 2, the Buddha declares: "I use various causes and conditions, various similes and parables, and various explanations to expound the Dharma... all for the sake of the One Buddha Vehicle."

The assembly's fear of being "discarded like snot and spit" (猶如棄涕唾) is poignant precisely because it contradicts the Lotus teaching. The Buddha's *parinirvāṇa* is not abandonment but the ultimate skillful means to ensure beings take the Dharma seriously.

**4. The Eight Classes as Witnesses (Throughout the Lotus Sutra)**

The presence of the eight classes of beings (八部眾) at this crucial moment mirrors their presence throughout the Lotus Sutra, particularly in the opening assembly of Chapter 1 ("Introduction"). Their collective grief demonstrates that the Buddha's teaching transcends all conventional boundaries—celestial beings, spirits, animals, and humans all equally depend on the Dharma.

**5. The Dangerous Road and the Safe Path (Lotus Chapter 3: "Parable of the Burning House")**

The assembly's metaphor of being "old and young people afflicted with illness, departing from the good path, traveling on a dangerous road" (老少、病苦之人，離於善徑，行於險路) parallels the Parable of the Burning House in Lotus Chapter 3, where children are trapped in a burning house (representing the three realms of *saṃsāra*) and must be lured out by the promise of carts (representing the three vehicles). The "dangerous road" of the twenty-five modes of existence is precisely the burning house of *saṃsāra*.

## Scholarly Notes

**Historical Context:**

This section represents a crucial moment in the Nirvana Sutra's narrative structure. The assembly's extended lament serves multiple literary and doctrinal functions:

1. **Emotional Intensification:** The detailed metaphors (calf losing mother, sick person without physician, kingdom without ruler) create emotional resonance that makes the Buddha's impending *parinirvāṇa* viscerally real for the reader.

2. **Doctrinal Preparation:** The assembly's complaints—particularly their accusation that the Buddha is "abandoning" them and their confusion about why an enlightened being would "fear" dharmas—set up the Buddha's subsequent teaching on the Four Inversions (四顛倒) in Section 9.

3. **Mahāyāna Apologetics:** The assembly's statement that the Buddha exclusively teaches Mañjuśrī the "secret treasury" (祕密之藏) while abandoning others reflects historical tensions between Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna schools. The Nirvana Sutra, as a Mahāyāna text, will resolve this by teaching that the "secret treasury" (the doctrine of Buddha-nature) is actually universal.

**Textual Variants:**

The Tibetan translation of this passage includes an additional verse comparing the Buddha's departure to "a great tree being felled," which does not appear in Dharmakṣema's Chinese translation. This suggests possible variations in the Sanskrit source texts.

**Cross-References:**

- The "twenty-five modes of existence" (二十五有) are detailed in Abhidharma literature, particularly the *Abhidharmakośa*.
- The metaphor of the Buddha as physician appears extensively in the *Lalitavistara Sūtra* and the *Aṣṭasāhasrikā Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra*.
- The eight classes of beings are enumerated in the *Saddharmapuṇḍarīka Sūtra* (Lotus Sutra) Chapter 1.
