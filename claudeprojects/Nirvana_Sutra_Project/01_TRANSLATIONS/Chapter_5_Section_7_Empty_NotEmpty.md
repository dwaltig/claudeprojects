### The Vessel Analogy: Empty and Not-Empty (Line 150)

**又解脫者，名空不空。如水、酒、酪、酥、蜜等瓶，雖無水酒酪酥蜜時，猶故得名為水等瓶，而是瓶等，不可說空及以不空。若言空者，則不得有色、香、味、觸；若言不空，而復無有水、酒等實。解脫亦爾，不可說色及以非色，不可說空及以不空。若言空者，則不得有常樂我淨；若言不空，誰受是常樂我淨者？以是義故，不可說空及以不空。空者謂無二十五有及諸煩惱、一切苦、一切相、一切有為行，如瓶無酪，則名為空；不空者，謂真實善色、常樂我淨、不動不變，猶如彼瓶，色香味觸，故名不空。是故解脫喻如彼瓶，彼瓶遇緣則有破壞；解脫不爾，不可破壞，不可破壞即真解脫，真解脫者即是如來。**

**Literal translation:**

"Also, liberation is called 'empty-not-empty.' Like vessels for water, wine, yogurt, butter, honey, etc.—although [they are] without water, wine, yogurt, butter, honey, [they] still are called water vessels, etc. Yet these vessels cannot be said [to be] empty or not-empty. If [you] say empty, then [they] do not have form, smell, taste, touch. If [you] say not-empty, yet again [they] do not have the reality of water, wine, etc. Liberation is also thus—cannot be said [to be] form or non-form, cannot be said [to be] empty or not-empty. If [you] say empty, then [it] does not have permanence, bliss, self, purity. If [you] say not-empty, who receives this permanence, bliss, self, purity? Because of this meaning, [it] cannot be said [to be] empty or not-empty. 'Empty' means without the twenty-five existences and all afflictions, all suffering, all characteristics, all conditioned activities—like a vessel without yogurt is called empty. 'Not-empty' means true, real, good form—permanence, bliss, self, purity, immovable, unchanging—like that vessel's form, smell, taste, touch, therefore called not-empty. Therefore liberation is likened to that vessel. That vessel encountering conditions can be destroyed; liberation is not thus—cannot be destroyed. Cannot be destroyed is precisely true liberation; true liberation is precisely the Tathāgata."

## Key Terms Breakdown

### The Professor's Philological Analysis

**1. 空不空 (kōng bù kōng) - Empty-Not-Empty**

- **Sanskrit:** *śūnya-aśūnya* (empty-not-empty)
- **Literal meaning:** 空 (empty) + 不空 (not-empty)
- **Why this translation:** This dialectical formulation is characteristic of Mahāyāna philosophy—ultimate reality transcends the binary of empty/not-empty
- **Doctrinal significance:** This is the heart of the Nirvana Sutra's teaching on the Four Perfections (permanence, bliss, self, purity). Liberation is:
  - **Empty** of: the 25 existences, afflictions, suffering, conditioned phenomena
  - **Not-empty** of: permanence, bliss, self, purity (the Four Perfections)

**2. 常樂我淨 (cháng lè wǒ jìng) - Permanence, Bliss, Self, Purity**

- **Sanskrit:** *nitya-sukha-ātman-śubha* (permanent-blissful-self-pure)
- **Literal meaning:** 常 (permanent) + 樂 (bliss) + 我 (self) + 淨 (pure)
- **Why this translation:** These are the "Four Perfections" or "Four Inversions" (*viparyāsa*) that characterize nirvāṇa in the Nirvana Sutra
- **Doctrinal significance:** This is revolutionary Mahāyāna teaching. Early Buddhism taught the "Four Marks" (impermanence, suffering, no-self, impurity) to break attachment. The Nirvana Sutra teaches that ultimate reality (nirvāṇa, Buddha-nature) has the opposite qualities: permanence, bliss, self, purity.

## Lotus Sutra Connections

### The Professor's Cross-References

**The Eternal Buddha (Lotus Chapter 16)**

The teaching that liberation is "not-empty" of permanence directly parallels Lotus Chapter 16's revelation of the eternal Buddha. The Buddha is not annihilated in parinirvāṇa but abides eternally—this is the "permanence" aspect of the Four Perfections.

## Scholarly Notes

**The Vessel Analogy:**

This is one of the most sophisticated analogies in Buddhist literature. A vessel that once held yogurt:
- Is "empty" (no yogurt in it)
- Is "not-empty" (still has form, smell, taste residue)
- Cannot be simply called "empty" or "not-empty"

Similarly, liberation:
- Is "empty" of saṃsāric existence
- Is "not-empty" of ultimate perfections
- Transcends the binary of empty/not-empty

**The Four Perfections:**

This teaching addresses a potential misunderstanding: If nirvāṇa is "empty," does that mean it's mere negation, nothingness? The Nirvana Sutra answers: No. Nirvāṇa is empty of defilements but not-empty of perfections.
