**Cunda's Verse (Lines 26-62):**

「快哉獲己利，  \t善得於人身，
蠲除貪恚等，  \t永[7]離三惡道。
快哉獲己利，  \t遇得金寶聚，
值遇調御師，  \t不懼墮畜生。
佛如優曇花，  \t值遇生信難，
遇已種善根，  \t永離餓鬼苦，
亦復能損減，  \t阿修羅種類。
芥子投針鋒，  \t佛出難於是，
我[8]以具足檀，  \t度人天生死。
佛不染世法，  \t如蓮花處水，
善斷有頂種，  \t永度生死流。
生世為人難，  \t值佛世亦難，
猶如大海中，  \t盲龜[9]遇浮孔。
我今所奉食，  \t願得無上報，
一切煩惱結，  \t摧破不堅牢。
我今於此處，  \t不求[10]天人身，
設使得之者，  \t心亦不甘樂。
如來受我供，  \t歡喜無有量，
猶如伊蘭花，  \t出於栴檀香。
我身如伊蘭，  \t如來受我供，
如出栴檀香，  \t是故我歡喜。
我今得現報，  \t最勝上妙處，
釋梵諸天等，  \t悉來供養我。
一切諸世間，  \t悉生[1]諸苦惱，
以知佛世尊，  \t欲入於涅槃。
高聲唱是言，  \t世間無調御，
不應捨眾生，  \t應視如一子。
如來在僧中，  \t演說無上法，
如須彌寶山，  \t安處于大海。
佛智能善斷，  \t我等無明闇，
猶如虛空中，  \t起雲得清涼。
如來能善[2]除，  \t一切諸煩惱，
猶如日出時，  \t除雲光普照。
是諸眾生等，  \t啼泣面目腫，
悉皆為生死，  \t苦水之所漂。
以是故世尊，  \t應長眾生信，
為斷生死苦，  \t久住於世間。」

## Key Terms Breakdown

### The Professor's Philological Analysis

**1. 優曇花 (yōu tán huā) - Udumbara Flower**

- **Sanskrit:** *udumbara*
- **Literal meaning:** Phonetic transliteration of Sanskrit
- **Why this translation:** 優曇 (yōu tán) phonetically approximates *udumbara*. The translators added 花 (flower) for clarity. The udumbara is a legendary flower said to bloom once every 3,000 years, only when a Buddha appears in the world.
- **Doctrinal significance:** Universal Buddhist symbol for the extreme rarity of encountering a Buddha and the dharma. Used throughout sūtra literature to emphasize urgency in practice.

**2. 盲龜遇浮孔 (máng guī yù fú kǒng) - Blind Turtle Encountering Floating Hole**

- **Sanskrit:** No direct Sanskrit equivalent; this is a parable found in various Āgama texts
- **Literal meaning:** 盲 (blind) + 龜 (turtle) + 遇 (encountering) + 浮 (floating) + 孔 (hole)
- **Why this translation:** Direct semantic translation of the parable elements. The image is vivid and concrete.
- **Doctrinal significance:** One of Buddhism's most famous parables illustrating the extreme rarity of human birth and encountering the dharma. A blind turtle living at the ocean bottom surfaces once every hundred years; somewhere on the ocean floats a wooden yoke with a hole. The chance of the turtle's head going through that hole equals the rarity of human birth and meeting a Buddha.

**3. 伊蘭花 / 栴檀香 (yī lán huā / zhān tán xiāng) - Eranda Flower / Sandalwood Fragrance**

- **Sanskrit:** *eranda* / *candana*
- **Literal meaning:** 伊蘭 phonetically approximates *eranda*; 栴檀 phonetically approximates *candana*
- **Why this translation:** Both are phonetic transliterations. The eranda tree is known for its foul smell, while sandalwood (*candana*) is the most precious fragrance in Indian culture.
- **Doctrinal significance:** Classic Buddhist metaphor for transformation through proximity to the holy. When sandalwood grows near the foul-smelling eranda, the eranda begins to smell sweet. Similarly, ordinary beings (eranda) become "fragrant" (enlightened) through contact with the Buddha (sandalwood).

**4. 有頂 (yǒu dǐng) - Peak of Existence / Bhavāgra**

- **Sanskrit:** *bhavāgra*
- **Literal meaning:** 有 (existence/becoming) + 頂 (peak/summit)
- **Why this translation:** Semantic translation capturing the Sanskrit *bhava* (existence/becoming) and *agra* (peak/foremost). Refers to the highest level of conditioned existence.
- **Doctrinal significance:** The "peak of existence" is the fourth and highest of the formless absorptions (*ārūpya-dhyāna*)—the meditative state of "neither-perception-nor-non-perception" (*naivasaṃjñānāsaṃjñāyatana*). Even this subtle attainment must be transcended for complete liberation, as it remains within conditioned existence.

---

## Lotus Sutra Connections

### The Professor's Cross-References

**1. Rarity of Meeting Buddha (Udumbara Flower)**

Cunda's statement "The Buddha is like the udumbara flower" directly parallels:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 27 (The Bodhisattva Universal Worthy):** "Meeting a Buddha is as rare as the udumbara flower blooming." The Lotus uses this exact metaphor to emphasize the preciousness of encountering the dharma.

**2. The Blind Turtle Parable**

This famous parable appears in various Buddhist texts and connects to the Lotus Sutra's teaching on urgency:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 3 (Parable of the Burning House):** The house is on fire—beings must escape immediately. The rarity of human birth and meeting Buddha (blind turtle parable) creates the same urgency.

**3. Transformation Through Proximity (Eranda/Sandalwood)**

Cunda's metaphor of the foul eranda becoming fragrant near sandalwood parallels:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 2 (Skillful Means):** All beings possess Buddha-nature and can attain Buddhahood. The eranda (ordinary being) has the potential to become fragrant (enlightened) through the Buddha's influence.
- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 5 (Medicinal Herbs):** Different plants receive the same dharma-rain according to their capacity. The eranda receiving transformation is like beings receiving the dharma according to their readiness.

**4. Rejecting Heavenly Rebirth for Supreme Enlightenment**

Cunda states: "I do not seek heaven or human body... even if obtaining it, my mind would not willingly delight in it." This connects to:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 3 (Parable of the Burning House):** The children initially wanted the three carts (lesser vehicles/heavenly rebirth) but ultimately receive the great white ox cart (supreme enlightenment/One Vehicle). Cunda, like the children, rejects lesser rewards for the ultimate goal.

**5. Buddha as Mount Sumeru**

Cunda's image of the Buddha "like Mount Sumeru peacefully dwelling in the great ocean" parallels:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 16 (Lifespan of the Tathāgata):** The Buddha is eternal, unshakeable, the stable axis of reality—like Sumeru, the cosmic mountain at the center of the universe.

**6. Beings Drowning in Suffering**

Cunda's image of beings "swept away by suffering-water" connects to:

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 7 (The Parable of the Phantom City):** Beings are on a dangerous path, exhausted, wanting to turn back. The Buddha as guide must lead them to safety.
- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 3:** The burning house represents saṃsāra; here, the drowning water represents the same—beings in urgent peril requiring the Buddha's rescue.
