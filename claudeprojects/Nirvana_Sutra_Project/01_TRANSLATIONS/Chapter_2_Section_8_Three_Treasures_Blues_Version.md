### "Three Lights, One Truth"

After they stopped crying, the Lord spoke to them in verse—slow and steady, like a hymn:

---

**"Open up your hearts,  
Don't carry all that grief.  
This is how it always goes—  
Every Buddha, every time.  
So be quiet now. Be still.  
Do the work. Pay attention.  
Keep your mind on what's real.  
Stay away from what's false.  
Let your heart rest.  
Find your joy."**

---

Then the Lord said to His disciples:

"If you got questions, ask them now. Ask me anything. You confused about emptiness? About what lasts and what don't? About suffering? About where to put your trust? About coming and going? About what's eternal and what ain't? About life and death? About what's real and what's fake? About what's hidden and what's plain? About duality and non-duality?

"Whatever you're confused about—ask me now. I'll cut through it for you. I'll give you the Truth—the sweet water, the ambrosia—before I go.

"Listen: It's rare for a Buddha to show up in this world. It's rare to be born human. It's rare to meet a Buddha and actually believe. It's rare to endure what can't be endured. It's rare to keep the precepts without breaking them. It's rare to wake up all the way. Rare as gold dust. Rare as a flower that blooms once every thousand years.

"You got lucky. You were born human. You met me. Don't waste it.

"I walked the hard road for you. I suffered for you. For countless lifetimes, I gave up everything—my body, my hands, my feet, my eyes, my brain—all of it, so you could have this chance. So don't be lazy. Don't fall asleep.

"You standing in front of a treasure city—a city full of jewels: discipline, concentration, wisdom. Walls made of truth. Gates made of light. And what are you doing? You're picking up rocks and trash and calling it treasure. You're like a merchant who finds a city of gold and fills his pockets with gravel.

"Don't settle for less. Don't be satisfied with scraps.

"You put on the robes, but your heart ain't changed. You beg for food, but you never begged for the real food—the Dharma of the Great Way. You shaved your head, but you didn't cut off your attachments.

"I'm telling you straight, right now, while we're all here together: The Truth is real. It don't lie. It don't change. So get to work. Focus. Fight. Break those chains. Because when I'm gone, when this light goes out, you're gonna be in the dark. And the dark is thick. The dark is heavy. The dark will cover you if you ain't ready."

### The Secret Treasury

Then the Lord said:

"The earth gives you everything—mountains, herbs, medicine. My teaching is like that. It grows the Truth. It heals the sickness—the sickness of wanting, hating, being confused.

"I'm about to put all of you—every living thing, and especially you, my children, the monks and nuns and laypeople—I'm about to put all of you in the secret treasury. And I'm going in there too. That's what it means when I say I'm entering *nirvāṇa*. I'm going into the treasury.

"What's the secret treasury?

"It's like this:

"You know the letter 'i' in the old language—Sanskrit? It's got three parts. Three marks. Three dots.

"If you put them side by side—like this: · · ·—it don't make the letter.

"If you stack them up and down—like this:  
·  
·  
·  
—it still don't make the letter.

"But if you arrange them just right—like the three eyes on the face of the Great Lord Shiva, two across and one above—then you got it. Then it's the letter 'i.'

"And if you pull them apart, separate them, it falls apart. It ain't nothing.

"That's how it is with me. That's how it is with the Truth.

"**Freedom alone ain't *nirvāṇa*.**  
**My body alone ain't *nirvāṇa*.**  
**Wisdom alone ain't *nirvāṇa*.**

"And if you keep them separate—if you say, 'I got freedom, that's enough,' or 'I got wisdom, that's enough'—you ain't got *nirvāṇa*. You got pieces. You got parts.

"But when all three come together—Freedom, the Body of Truth, and Wisdom—when they're all there at the same time, arranged just right, like the three dots of that letter, like the three eyes of the Great Lord—**that's *nirvāṇa*.**

"That's where I am. That's where I'm taking you. That's the secret treasury.

"When I say I'm 'entering *nirvāṇa*,' I'm not disappearing. I'm not dying. I'm showing you the Truth: I'm in all three. I **am** all three. And so are you, if you'd just wake up and see it.

"It's like the letter 'i.' Three parts. One truth."

## THE ATMOSPHERE

**The Moan:**  
The moan here is the sound of people who almost got it but didn't. They're standing in front of the treasure and picking up trash. They're wearing the robes but their hearts ain't changed. They're so close—so close—but they're settling for less. It's the moan of wasted potential. The moan of "I coulda been, but I wasn't." It's the Lord saying, "I gave you everything. Don't throw it away."

**The Turnaround:**  
The turnaround is the revelation of the secret treasury. It's the moment the Lord says, "Let me show you what *nirvāṇa* really is." It's not one thing. It's three things that are really one thing. Freedom, Truth-Body, Wisdom—all at once, all together, perfectly arranged. And the turnaround is this: **You already got all three inside you. You just gotta wake up to it.** The Lord ain't going nowhere. He's going into the treasury, and He's taking you with Him. You just gotta see it.

**The Sound:**  
This should be read like a teaching. Slow. Deliberate. Let every image land. The treasure city. The merchant with gravel in his pockets. The three dots of the letter 'i.' The three eyes of Shiva. These are pictures. Let them paint themselves in the listener's mind. And when you get to the revelation—"Freedom alone ain't *nirvāṇa*"—let that hit hard. Repeat it. Let it sink in. This is the secret. This is what the whole thing's been building toward.

## Key Terms (Endnotes for Learners)

**The Three Dots of the Sanskrit Letter "i" (伊字三點)**  
In the old Sanskrit language, the letter "i" (इ) is written with three parts—three marks, three dots, depending on how you look at it. The Lord uses this as a picture of what *nirvāṇa* really is. It ain't just one thing. It's three things that gotta be together, arranged just right, to make the whole.

The three parts are:
1. **Freedom (解脫)** - Liberation from suffering, from craving, from the wheel of birth and death.
2. **The Dharma-Body (法身)** - The Truth-Body, the eternal nature of the Buddha, the reality that don't change.
3. **Great Wisdom (摩訶般若)** - The deep knowing, the seeing-through, the understanding of how things really are.

If you got just one, you ain't got *nirvāṇa*. If you got two, you still ain't got it. You need all three, and they gotta be together, simultaneous, like the three parts of that letter. That's the secret. That's the treasury.

This teaching is huge because it corrects a misunderstanding. Some folks thought *nirvāṇa* was just freedom—just getting out of suffering, like blowing out a candle. But the Lord says no. *Nirvāṇa* is freedom **and** the eternal Truth-Body **and** wisdom, all at once. It's not annihilation. It's fullness. It's completion.

**Maheśvara (摩醯首羅)**  
This is the Sanskrit name for Shiva, the Great Lord in the Hindu tradition. Shiva's got three eyes—two regular eyes and a third eye in the middle of his forehead, the wisdom eye. The Lord uses this image because everybody in India knew what Shiva looked like. Two eyes across, one eye above—that's a triangle. That's the arrangement of the three dots that makes the letter 'i.'

The Lord's using a Hindu image to teach a Buddhist truth. That's skillful means. He's meeting people where they are, using what they already know, to show them something new.

**The Secret Treasury (祕密藏)**  
This is the hidden treasure, the deep teaching, the thing that ain't obvious until you're ready to see it. It ain't "secret" because the Buddha's hiding it. It's "secret" because it's so deep, so profound, that you can't see it until you got the eyes to see.

The secret treasury is this: All beings got Buddha-nature. The Truth-Body is eternal. *Nirvāṇa* ain't extinction—it's the fullness of Freedom, Truth-Body, and Wisdom all together.

The Lord says He's putting everybody—all beings, the whole fourfold assembly—into this secret treasury. He's revealing it. He's opening the door. And He's saying, "Come on in. This is where I am. This is where you belong."

**The Fourfold Assembly (四部之眾)**  
This is the whole Buddhist community: monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen. Everybody. The Lord's saying the secret treasury ain't just for the monks. It ain't just for the elite. It's for **everybody**. If you're in the assembly, you're invited into the treasury. That's the Mahāyāna way—universal liberation, universal Buddha-nature, universal access to the highest truth.

## Lotus Sutra Connections

### The Bluesman's Take

This teaching—the three-in-one nature of *nirvāṇa*—is the Nirvana Sutra's way of explaining what the Lotus Sutra already revealed: **The Buddha is eternal.**

In **Lotus Chapter 16**, the Lord drops the big secret: "Y'all think I just got enlightened under the Bodhi tree 40-some years ago? Nah. I been enlightened for countless ages. I been free forever. This whole thing—being born, seeking, suffering, waking up, teaching, dying—it's all theater. It's all skillful means to show you the way."

The Nirvana Sutra takes that and says, "Okay, but what **is** that eternal Buddha? What's the structure of that eternal nature?" And the answer is: It's the three-in-one. It's Freedom (He's liberated from suffering), it's the Dharma-Body (He's the eternal Truth itself), and it's Wisdom (He sees everything as it really is). All three, all at once, perfectly integrated.

That's why the Lord says, "Freedom alone ain't *nirvāṇa*." Because if *nirvāṇa* was just freedom—just getting out of suffering—then the Buddha would've disappeared when He got enlightened. But He didn't. He's still here. He's eternal. That's the Dharma-Body. And He knows everything. That's the Wisdom. So *nirvāṇa* is all three.

**Lotus Chapter 2** says there's only One Vehicle—the Buddha Vehicle. The three vehicles (the path of the hearers, the path of the solitary realizers, the path of the bodhisattvas) are provisional. They're stepping stones. The real goal is the One Vehicle, which is full Buddhahood.

The Nirvana Sutra's teaching fits right into that. The hearers (*śrāvakas*) focus on freedom—getting out of suffering. That's good, but it ain't the whole picture. The solitary realizers (*pratyekabuddhas*) add wisdom—they see dependent origination, they understand how things work. That's better, but it's still not complete. The bodhisattvas add compassion and the Dharma-Body—they realize the eternal nature of the Buddha. And when you put all three together—freedom, wisdom, and the Dharma-Body—you got the One Vehicle. You got full *nirvāṇa*.

The Lord's warning to the monks—"You put on the robes, but your heart ain't changed. You beg for food, but you never begged for the real food"—that's the same message as **Lotus Chapter 7**, the Parable of the Phantom City. In that parable, the travelers are exhausted, ready to quit. So the guide conjures up a phantom city—a place to rest. They rest there, thinking they've arrived. But then the guide says, "Nah, this ain't the real city. This is just a rest stop. The real treasure city is still ahead."

The monks in the Nirvana Sutra are like those travelers. They reached the phantom city—they got freedom from suffering, they became *arhats*. And they think that's it. But the Lord's saying, "Nah. That's just the rest stop. The real treasure—the Dharma-Body, the Wisdom, the full *nirvāṇa*—that's still ahead. Don't settle. Don't stop. Keep going."

And that image of the merchant who finds a treasure city but fills his pockets with gravel? That's heartbreaking. That's the tragedy of settling for less when you could have everything. The Lotus Sutra says the same thing in **Chapter 4**, the Parable of the Poor Son. A man runs away from his father's mansion, thinking he's not worthy. He becomes a beggar, living in poverty. Meanwhile, his father's been looking for him, waiting for him to come home. Finally, the father finds him, but the son's so convinced he's worthless that he won't accept his inheritance. So the father uses skillful means—he hires the son as a servant, lets him work his way up, until finally the son realizes: "I'm the heir. This is all mine."

That's the secret treasury. You already own it. You're already the heir. You just gotta realize it. The three-in-one nature of *nirvāṇa*—Freedom, Dharma-Body, Wisdom—it's already yours. You just gotta wake up and claim it.

The Lord says, "I'm entering *nirvāṇa*." But He ain't leaving. He's revealing where He's always been: in the secret treasury, the three-in-one, the fullness of Truth. And He's saying, "Come on in. This is where you belong. This is what you are."

**That's the Lotus Sutra. That's the Nirvana Sutra. Same truth, different words.**
