### 'Empty Pockets, Full Heart'

Kāśyapa spoke up again and said:

'Lord, I remember another one of Your old songs. You used to sing:

> *'Don't pile up nothing,*  
> *Be happy with what you got to eat,*  
> *Like a bird flying through the sky—*  
> *Don't leave no tracks behind.'*

'Lord, what does that mean? Who in this whole gathering can say they ain't piling up nothing? Who can say they're content with just enough food? Who's walking through this world without leaving tracks? And when somebody like that leaves—where they going?'

---

### The Lord's Answer: Two Kinds of Gathering

The Lord said:

'Kāśyapa, when I talk about 'piling up,' I'm talking about **wealth**. I'm talking about **treasures**. I'm talking about **holding on to things**.

'But listen—there's **two kinds** of piling up. Two kinds of gathering. Two kinds of holding on.

'**First kind:** The conditioned kind. The made kind. The kind that's built up piece by piece.

'**Second kind:** The unconditioned kind. The unmade kind. The kind that just **is**.

'Now, the **conditioned gathering**—that's what My disciples do. The monks, the nuns, the hearers of the Dharma. They gather merit. They gather wisdom. They gather virtue. They're building something, step by step.

'But the **unconditioned gathering**—that's what **I** do. That's the Tathāgata's way. I ain't building nothing. I ain't piling up nothing. I just **am** what I am. The Dharma-body don't accumulate—it just **is**.

---

### Two Kinds of Saṅgha

'And the same goes for the community—the saṅgha. There's **two kinds**:

'**First kind:** The conditioned saṅgha. That's My disciples—the monks and nuns who follow the path, who keep the precepts, who practice step by step.

'**Second kind:** The unconditioned saṅgha. That's **Me**. That's the Tathāgata. That's the Dharma-body.

'Now, My disciples—the conditioned saṅgha—they don't pile up **nothing**. And I mean **nothing**. They don't got:

- Slaves or servants
- Storehouses full of grain and rice
- Barrels of salt and beans and sesame
- None of that

'And let Me tell you something, Kāśyapa: If **anybody** says the Tathāgata permits keeping slaves, permits hoarding food, permits piling up wealth—**their tongue ought to shrivel up in their mouth**. Because that's a lie. That's going against everything I taught.

'My disciples got **empty pockets**. They're content with just enough food to keep going. They ain't greedy. They ain't hoarding. They're walking light.

'And that's what it means to be 'content with what you got to eat.' If you're greedy for food, you ain't content. If you ain't greedy, you **are** content. Simple as that.

### Walking Without Leaving Tracks

'Now, when I say 'like a bird flying through the sky, don't leave no tracks'—I'm talking about somebody who's **close to the path**. Somebody who's near the unsurpassed enlightenment.

'Because when you're walking that path, you ain't going **nowhere**. You're moving, but you ain't arriving. You're traveling, but you ain't getting to some other place.

'Why? Because **there ain't no other place to get to**. You're already there. You just gotta realize it.'

---

### Kāśyapa's Understanding

Kāśyapa said:

'Lord, I hear You. If the **conditioned** saṅgha—Your disciples—they ain't piling up nothing, then **how much more** the **unconditioned** saṅgha?

'The unconditioned saṅgha—that's **You**, Lord. That's the Tathāgata. So how could You have any accumulation at all?

'Because 'accumulation' means **hiding**. 'Accumulation' means **holding back**. 'Accumulation' means **keeping secrets**.

'But You don't do that, Lord. Everything You say, You say freely. You don't hold nothing back. You don't hide nothing. So how could anybody call that a 'treasury'?

'And when You talk about 'walking without leaving tracks'—that's **nirvāṇa**, ain't it?

'Because in nirvāṇa, there ain't no:

- Sun or moon
- Stars or constellations
- Cold or heat
- Wind or rain
- Birth, old age, sickness, or death
- None of the twenty-five realms of existence

'Nirvāṇa is **free** from all that. Free from all worries. Free from all suffering. Free from all the mess that tangles us up.

'And **that's** where You live, Lord. That's Your dwelling place. **Nirvāṇa**. And it don't change. It don't fade. It's constant. It's eternal.

'So when You come here to these twin śāla trees, when You enter the great nirvāṇa—You ain't **going** nowhere. You're just **revealing** where You've always been.

'You're already **home**, Lord. You're just showing us the way.'

## THE ATMOSPHERE

**The Moan:**  
The moan here is the sound of trying to understand what it means to have **nothing** and yet have **everything**. It's Kāśyapa asking, 'Lord, what does it mean to not pile up nothing? What does it mean to walk without leaving tracks?' It's the moan of a disciple who's living with empty pockets, eating just enough to get by, trying to walk the path—and wondering if he's doing it right. It's the moan of poverty that ain't sure if it's holy or just hard.

**The Turnaround:**  
The turnaround is the Lord's revelation that there's **two kinds** of everything—conditioned and unconditioned. The disciples have empty pockets (conditioned poverty), but the Lord has infinite wealth (unconditioned fullness). The disciples are walking the path step by step (conditioned practice), but the Lord just **is** the path (unconditioned being). The turnaround is realizing: You ain't poor because you're lacking something. You're poor because you're **letting go** of what don't matter so you can receive what **does** matter. And what matters is **nirvāṇa**—the place where the Lord lives, the place where there ain't no suffering, the place that don't change. That's home. That's where you're headed. And the Lord's already there, waiting for you.

**The Sound:**  
This should be read like a teaching session—patient, methodical, building understanding piece by piece. The Lord's explanation of 'two kinds' should be clear and deliberate: 'First kind... Second kind...' Let each distinction land before moving to the next. Kāśyapa's response should sound like a light bulb going on—'Oh, I get it now!' He's putting the pieces together, seeing how it all fits. And when he describes nirvāṇa—'no sun or moon, no stars, no cold or heat'—let that be a litany, a rhythmic listing that builds to the climax: 'That's where You live, Lord. That's Your home.' This is a moment of realization, of understanding, of seeing the truth clearly.

## Key Terms (Endnotes for Learners)

**Conditioned (有為) vs. Unconditioned (無為)**  
This is one of the biggest distinctions in Buddhism. Let me break it down:

**Conditioned** means something that's **made**. Something that's **built up**. Something that comes together because of causes and conditions, and falls apart when those causes and conditions change.

Examples:
- Your body (made from food, water, air, your parents' DNA)
- Your thoughts (made from memories, sensations, habits)
- Your merit (built up through good actions)

Everything conditioned is **impermanent**. It arises, it exists for a while, it fades away.

**Unconditioned** means something that's **not made**. Something that just **is**. Something that don't depend on causes and conditions. Something that don't arise or fade because it was never built up in the first place.

Examples:
- Nirvāṇa (the state of liberation—it ain't created, it's realized)
- The Dharma-body (the Lord's true nature—eternal, unchanging)
- Space (it's just there—you don't make it, you don't destroy it)

The Lord's teaching here is that His disciples practice in a **conditioned** way—they're building merit, gathering wisdom, walking the path step by step. But the Lord Himself is **unconditioned**—He ain't building nothing. He just **is** what He is. The Dharma-body don't accumulate. It's already complete.

**The Twenty-Five Existences (二十五有)**  
This is a way of categorizing all the different places you can be reborn in saṃsāra—the cycle of birth and death. The twenty-five existences include:

- **4 evil realms:** Hell, hungry ghosts, animals, asuras (fighting spirits)
- **1 human realm:** Where we are now
- **20 heavenly realms:** Various levels of gods and higher beings

The point is: **Nirvāṇa ain't one of them**. Nirvāṇa ain't the twenty-sixth realm. Nirvāṇa is **outside** the whole system. It's the **end** of the cycle, not another stop on the wheel.

When Kāśyapa says 'in nirvāṇa there ain't no sun or moon, no birth or death, no twenty-five existences,' he's saying: Nirvāṇa is **freedom** from the whole mess. It's not another place you go to. It's the **end** of going.

**Parinirvāṇa (般涅槃)**  
This word means 'complete nirvāṇa' or 'final nirvāṇa.' It's usually used to describe the Buddha's death—His final departure from the world.

But here's the paradox: Kāśyapa says, 'The Lord comes to these śāla trees, in the great nirvāṇa, and enters parinirvāṇa.'

Wait—He's **already in** nirvāṇa, and He's **entering** nirvāṇa? How does that work?

Because nirvāṇa is the Lord's **constant dwelling place**. He's always been there. He's always **in** nirvāṇa. So when He 'enters parinirvāṇa,' He ain't going somewhere new. He's just **revealing** where He's always been.

It's like a man who's been standing in his own house the whole time, and then he says, 'Okay, now I'm going home.' He ain't going nowhere. He's just showing you: 'This is where I live. This is where I've always been.'

**Walking Without Leaving Tracks**  
This is a beautiful image. A bird flies through the sky, and when it's gone, there's no trace. No footprints. No path. Nothing to mark where it's been.

The Lord uses this to describe somebody who's close to enlightenment. Why? Because when you're walking the true path, you ain't **going** nowhere. You're not accumulating merit like you're piling up treasure. You're not leaving a trail of good deeds behind you like breadcrumbs.

You're just **being**. You're just **walking**. And when you're done, there's no trace—because you weren't trying to make a mark. You were just living the truth.

## Lotus Sutra Connections

### The Bluesman's Take

This whole section connects to the **Lotus Sutra's teaching on the eternal Buddha** (Chapter 16) and the **One Buddha Vehicle** (Chapters 2-3).

**The Eternal Dwelling Place (Lotus Chapter 16)**

Kāśyapa says, 'Nirvāṇa is the Lord's dwelling place, constant and unchanging.'

That's **Lotus Chapter 16** in a nutshell. In that chapter, the Lord reveals:

> 'This, my land, remains safe and tranquil, constantly filled with heavenly and human beings. The halls and pavilions in its gardens and groves are adorned with various kinds of gems.'

The Lord's saying: **I got a home. I got a place where I live. And it's eternal. It don't change. It don't fade.**

Most people think nirvāṇa is **annihilation**—like blowing out a candle, and then there's nothing. But the Lotus Sutra and the Nirvana Sutra both say: **No**. Nirvāṇa is **fullness**. It's the Lord's dwelling place. It's **home**.

And when the Lord 'enters parinirvāṇa,' He ain't disappearing into nothingness. He's going **home**. He's revealing where He's always been.

**Conditioned and Unconditioned Practice (Lotus Chapters 2-3)**

The Lord's distinction between 'conditioned accumulation' (the disciples' practice) and 'unconditioned accumulation' (the Tathāgata's being) is the same as the Lotus Sutra's teaching on the **three vehicles** vs. the **One Buddha Vehicle**:

- **Three vehicles (conditioned practice):** The disciples practice step by step. They follow rules. They accumulate merit. They're building something.

- **One Buddha Vehicle (unconditioned being):** The Lord don't practice. He don't accumulate. He just **is**. He's already complete. He's already enlightened. He's already home.

The Lotus Sutra (Chapter 2) says:

> 'There ain't two vehicles, much less three. I only taught three vehicles to meet you where you were. But the truth? There's only **one** vehicle, and it's taking everybody to the same place: Buddhahood.'

Same teaching here. The disciples are walking the conditioned path—step by step, building merit, gathering wisdom. But the Lord's already at the destination. He's already **there**. He's unconditioned. He's complete.

And here's the kicker: **You're headed there too**. You're walking the conditioned path now, but you're headed toward the unconditioned reality. You're building merit now, but one day you'll realize: **You don't need to build nothing. You already got it. You just gotta realize it.**

**The Traceless Path (Lotus Chapter 2)**

The image of the bird flying through the sky without leaving tracks is the same as the Lotus Sutra's teaching that the Buddha's wisdom is **beyond words, beyond concepts, beyond understanding**:

> 'The wisdom of the Buddhas is infinitely profound and immeasurable. The door to this wisdom is difficult to understand and difficult to enter.'

You can't track it. You can't measure it. You can't pin it down. It's like trying to follow a bird's path through the sky—there ain't no path to follow. There's just the bird, flying free.

That's the ultimate teaching. That's the *vyākaraṇa*. That's what you're headed toward: **Freedom so complete, you don't even leave tracks behind.**
