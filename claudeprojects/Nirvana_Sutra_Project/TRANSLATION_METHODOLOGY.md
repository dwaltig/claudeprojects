# Translation Methodology Summary

## Complete Dual-Agent Workflow

This document summarizes the complete methodology developed for Nirvana Sutra translation.

### The Professor's Responsibilities

1. **Word-by-word literal translation** with pinyin and character analysis
2. **Buddhist term identification** with proper Sanskrit diacriticals
3. **Scholarly notes** on doctrinal significance
4. **Key Terms Breakdown** (3-4 terms per passage):
   - Chinese characters and pinyin
   - Sanskrit origins
   - **Philological reasoning** (why these Chinese characters were chosen)
   - Doctrinal significance
5. **Lotus Sutra Cross-References** - Specific chapter citations showing doctrinal parallels

### The Bluesman's Responsibilities

1. **Blues vernacular translation** - Transform scholarly text into grounded, accessible language
2. **THE ATMOSPHERE** section:
   - The Moan (suffering/struggle)
   - The Turnaround (liberation/resolution)
   - The Sound (how to read/perform)
3. **Key Terms (Endnotes for Learners)** - Accessible explanations using concrete metaphors
4. **Lotus Sutra Connections** - Show how teachings relate to Lotus Sutra in grounded language

### Key Principles

- **No Chinese characters in Blues main text** - Only in endnotes
- **Always include Lotus Sutra connections** - User is a Lotus Sutra student
- **Grounded theology** - Keep it real, accessible, experiential
- **Philological precision** - Explain why translators chose specific characters
