# Nirvana Sutra Project

## Project Overview

This project contains dual-translation work on the Nirvana Sutra (涅槃經 Nièpán Jīng), using a two-agent methodology:

1. **The Professor** - Provides literal, scholarly, word-by-word translation with Buddhist terminology identification
2. **The Bluesman** - Transforms the literal translation into blues/gospel vernacular, using the language of hardship, redemption, and grace

## Current Work

## Translation Standards

Following conventions from main workspace:
- UTF-8 encoding for all files
- Sanskrit diacriticals: Tathāgata, nirvāṇa, etc.
