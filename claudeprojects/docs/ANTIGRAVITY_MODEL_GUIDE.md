## Claude Models (Anthropic)

| Model | Strengths | Best For |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Claude Sonnet 4.5** | Fast, capable, good balance of speed/quality | Everyday coding, quick edits, general chat |
| **Claude Sonnet 4.5 (Thinking)** | Extended reasoning, "thinks" before responding | Complex problems, multi-step logic |
| **Claude Opus 4.5 (Thinking)** | Most capable Claude, deep reasoning | Scholarly work, nuanced translation, sophisticated image prompts |

---

## Gemini Models (Google)

| Model | Strengths | Best For |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Gemini 3 Pro (High)** | Full power, larger context window | Long documents, complex analysis |
| **Gemini 3 Pro (Low)** | Faster, lighter resource usage | Quick tasks, when speed matters |

---

## Other Models

| Model | Strengths | Best For |
|-------|-----------|----------|
| **GPT-OSS 120B (Medium)** | Open-source (120B params) | Non-proprietary option |

---

## Recommendations for Sutra Projects

| Task | Recommended Model |
|------|-------------------|
| Sutra translation & scholarly writing | **Claude Opus 4.5 (Thinking)** |
| Quick code edits & everyday tasks | **Claude Sonnet 4.5** or **Gemini 3 Pro (Low)** |
| Long manuscripts & big context | **Gemini 3 Pro (High)** |
| Image prompt crafting / cover art | **Claude Opus 4.5 (Thinking)** |
| Audiobook script formatting | **Claude Sonnet 4.5** |

---

## Notes

- **"Thinking" models** take longer but produce more reasoned, nuanced outputs
- **Opus** produced superior image prompts for cover art (per William's observation)
- **High vs Low** on Gemini likely refers to compute/quality tradeoff
