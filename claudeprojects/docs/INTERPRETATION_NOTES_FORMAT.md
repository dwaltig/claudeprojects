# Interpretation Notes Formatting Standard

## CRITICAL VISION FOR INTERPRETATION NOTES

**The INTERPRETATION NOTES section is flexible and can vary by chapter**, but must always:
1. Be in plain text format (NO bold headers, NO markdown)
2. Come AFTER "END OF CHAPTER [NUMBER]: [TITLE]" marker
3. Include subsections as appropriate to that chapter's content
4. Use text headers without bold formatting (like "What I kept" in Chapter 1, or "Key Metaphors" in Chapter 5)

### Subsection Headers Format (Plain Text Only):

Each chapter uses appropriate subsections for its content:

**Chapter 1 Uses:**
- "What I kept" (with bullet points)
- "What I changed" (with bullet points)
- Narrative paragraphs about the verses and content

**Chapter 5 Uses:**
- "Key Metaphors:" with list items
- "The Five Types of Plants:" with numbered list
- "Core Teaching:" with paragraph explanations
- "Why Blues Language?" with bullet points and closing paragraph

**Chapter 2 Uses:**
- Key translation terms and their meanings
- Content arc summary with bullet points
- Closing reflection

### CRITICAL RULE:
✅ **Plain text headers only** - NO bold formatting
✅ **Subsections vary by chapter** - use what makes sense for that chapter's content
✅ **Consistent placement** - Always after "END OF CHAPTER" marker
✅ **Consistent styling** - Plain text throughout, with bullet points/lists where appropriate

### Applied To:
- Chapter 1: ✅ Uses "What I kept" / "What I changed" + narrative
- Chapter 2: ✅ Uses interpretation choices + arc summary + reflection
- Chapter 4: ✅ Uses metaphorical choices + journey tracking + reflection
- Chapter 5: ✅ Uses Key Metaphors + Five Types + Core Teaching + Why Blues Language

## Key Insight:
Each chapter's INTERPRETATION NOTES is **tailored to that chapter's content and teaching structure**, not a cookie-cutter format. But all follow the same theme: plain text, clear subsections, explanatory depth.
