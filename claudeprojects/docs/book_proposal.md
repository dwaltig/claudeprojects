## CONCEPT

This trilogy presents complete English translations of three interconnected Mahayana Buddhist sutras rendered in African American vernacular English—specifically, the linguistic and spiritual idiom of the blues and gospel traditions. The work translates from classical Chinese versions (originally from Sanskrit) into contemporary blues voice, creating what may be the first sustained attempt to render major Buddhist scriptures in African American English.

The three texts form a traditional Buddhist trilogy:
1. **The Immeasurable Meanings Sutra** (15,000 words) — the prologue
2. **The Lotus Sutra** (129,000 words) — the central teaching
3. **The Universal Worthy Bodhisattva Sutra** (19,000 words) — the epilogue

Together, these sutras constitute one of Buddhism's most influential scripture collections, foundational to East Asian Buddhism and particularly important in Tendai, Nichiren, and Pure Land traditions.

## THE UNIQUE PROPOSITION

### Why This Translation Matters

This work sits at the intersection of three significant trends in contemporary religious and cultural life:

**1. Buddhist Translation Innovation**  
Following Kumārajīva's model of rendering Sanskrit into accessible Chinese vernacular (406 CE), this translation prioritizes lived accessibility over academic literalism, bringing ancient wisdom into the cadences of contemporary spoken English.

**2. Recognition of African American Spiritual Wisdom**  
The blues and gospel traditions represent profound theological sophistication born from suffering, resilience, and transcendence—themes that resonate deeply with core Buddhist teachings about dukkha (suffering), compassion, and liberation.

**3. Democratization of Sacred Texts**  
By rendering the Lotus Sutra's revolutionary message—that *all* beings will attain Buddhahood—in the vernacular of communities historically excluded from "high culture" religious discourse, this translation embodies the very universalism it preaches.

### The Blues-Buddhism Connection

Both traditions:
- Emerge from profound suffering (slavery/oppression and samsara/dukkha)
- Transform pain into transcendent wisdom
- Use repetition, call-and-response, and oral formulae
- Insist on hope and liberation despite suffering
- Speak truth in everyday language
- Prioritize felt experience over abstract doctrine
