Something to Protect
Eliezer Yudkowsky

In Japanese fiction, there's a motif: Power comes from having something to protect. In the X saga, characters draw power from having one precious person they want to protect. If that person is killed, the protector loses their power from despair.

In Western comics, the magic comes first, then the purpose: Acquire powers, decide to fight crime. In Japanese fiction, it often works the other way around.

I have touched on the idea that a rationalist must have something they value more than "rationality". The Art must have a purpose other than itself. I am asking: Where do rationalists come from? How do we acquire our powers?

Twelve Virtues of Rationality asks: How can you improve your conception of rationality? Not by saying "It is my duty to be rational." Perhaps your conception of rationality is to believe the Great Teacher, even if they say the sky is green. If you think that is rationality, you lose the chance to discover your mistake.

Historically, science won because beliefs based on experiment turned out to be more useful than beliefs based on authority. Science displayed greater raw strength in the form of technology. Magic and scripture still sound more intuitively reasonable to untrained ears.

One doesn't become an adept rationalist without caring about the truth. But part of what I like about rationality is the discipline of requiring predictions, which takes us closer to the truth than sits in a living room obsessing about Truth. I value mere usefulness above aesthetics.

But morality and aesthetics alone will not lead you to the center of the Way. Which would you prefer: Save 400 lives with certainty, or save 500 lives with 90% probability? If your daughter is one of the 500, you feel impelled to shut up and multiply. You care more about your daughter's life than about "rationality".

You will only learn something about rationality if your daughter's life matters more than your pride as a rationalist. You need quite a bit of rationality to bootstrap the learning process.

I only began to grow further as a rationalist once I had something terribly important that I needed to do. Something more important than my pride or my life. Only when you become more wedded to success than to any of your beloved techniques, do you appreciate Miyamoto Musashi: "You can win with a long weapon, and yet you can also win with a short weapon."

No one masters the Way until more than their life is at stake. If you have a cause like that, it is right and proper to wield your rationality in its service. To strictly subordinate the aesthetics of rationality to a higher cause is part of the aesthetic of rationality.
