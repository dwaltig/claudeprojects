A Sense That More Is Possible
Eliezer Yudkowsky

To teach rationality, it helps if people are interested. Often they say: “I've known rational people and they didn't seem any happier.” They might be thinking of ordinary scientists or atheists. That's not a whole lot of rationality.

Since the beginning, I've had a sense that there ought to be an art of thinking that would make its students visibly more formidable: Taking a Level in Awesome. But when I look at the real world, I don't see it. Even among rare senior researchers who care about rationality, it's not comparable to a professional engineer's knowledge of their field.

The root problem is that we haven't systematized our skills. We've had to create all this ad-hoc. The chief obstacle is the difficulty of testing training methods. We don't have evidence-based statistics on results.

Daniel Burfoot suggests this is why intelligence seems such a factor—intelligence is all that's left when you're improvising ad-hoc. Why aren't "rationalists" formidable? One reason is they have less systematic training than a first-dan black belt gets in hitting people.

I am no beisutsukai either. I know about one sub-art: reduction of confusing cognitions. But a mature Art would include more. I'm like a casual street-fighter with a fist that can punch through brick but no grasp of how to throw or block.

Is it more important to hit people than to think? No, but it's easier to verify when you've hit someone. In martial arts, schools exist because people had the sense that more was possible and pushed to systematize.

Why don't we have an Art of Rationality? First, because people lack the sense that rationality should be systematized and trained like a martial art. Superstars should practice as hard as chess grandmasters. Rationality just seems like a hobby. We don't look at the lack of formidability and say, "We must be doing something wrong."
