Tsuyoku Naritai! (I Want To Become Stronger)
Eliezer Yudkowsky

In Orthodox Judaism, there's a saying: “The previous generation is to the next one as angels are to men; the next generation is to the previous one as donkeys are to men.” Knowledge derives from authority, and therefore is only ever lost, not gained. Modern rabbis can't overrule ancient ones.

Even in elementary school, I thought: “Torah loses knowledge. Science gains it. Sooner or later science must surpass Torah.” The most important thing is that there should be progress.

"Tsuyoku naritai" is Japanese for “I want to become stronger.” It expresses the will to transcendence—determination to become a professional, or to do better even after winning.

On Yom Kippur, Jews recite a litany: We have betrayed, we have stolen... striking the heart in penitence. It's about confessing sins, not avoiding them. This resembles the notion that rationality is to say, “We are all biased, all irrational...”

Fine. Now tell me how you plan to become less biased. Take no pride in your confession. Do not glory in your self-awareness of your flaws. If your ignorance or flaws are a source of pride, you may become loath to relinquish them. The occasion for rejoicing is when we have a little less to confess.

Never confess to me that you are just as flawed as I am unless you can tell me what you plan to do about it. The important thing is to do better, to keep moving ahead. Tsuyoku naritai!
