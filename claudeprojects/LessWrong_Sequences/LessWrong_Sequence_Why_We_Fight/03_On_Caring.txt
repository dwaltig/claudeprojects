On Caring
So8res

I'm not very good at feeling the size of large numbers. Once you start tossing around numbers larger than 1000, the numbers just seem "big". My brain can't even begin to wrap itself around magnitude differentials. This is related to scope insensitivity.

Knowing this, I care about every single individual on this planet. The problem is, my brain is simply incapable of taking the caring I feel for a single person and scaling it up by a billion times. My care-o-meter simply doesn't go up that far.

Caring about the world isn't about having a gut feeling that corresponds to the amount of suffering; it's about doing the right thing anyway. Even without the feeling. Humanity is playing for unimaginably high stakes.

Alice, Bob, and Christine donate money largely motivated by social context (obligation, social pressure, competitiveness). These motivations are only tangentially related to the content of the donation. They aren't spending time solving all the world's problems because they forget to see them.

Daniel, after the BP oil spill, realized that if he cares for an oiled bird ($3 or 3 minutes), then by "shutting up and multiplying," he actually cares about the world's problems to the tune of much more money and time than he has. In this mindstate, everything is his problem. He realizes he can't possibly do enough.

Many of us trust our internal care-o-meters. We think we can't do more because we weren't "gifted" with extra-caring. But prominent altruists aren't people with larger care-o-meters; they are people who have learned not to trust their care-o-meters.

Address the major problems of our time isn't about feeling a strong compulsion. It's about doing it anyway. Trust the numbers more than feelings, because feelings lie. There is only you, and me, and everyone else who is trying anyway.
