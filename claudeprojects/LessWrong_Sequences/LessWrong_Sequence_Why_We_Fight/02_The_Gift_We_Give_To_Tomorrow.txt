The Gift We Give To Tomorrow
Eliezer Yudkowsky

How did an unloving and mindless universe cough up minds capable of love? Natural selection is cruel and bloody. Genetic fitness is about having more children than others. It can even lead to extinction.

"No mystery," you say. "A mother shares genes with her children, so she loves them." But mothers adopt. And mothers love children for themselves, not genes. "Reciprocal altruism," you say. But true friendship exists. Sacrifice exists.

And Gandhi? "Believed certain complicated propositions about 'What should be done?' and did them." It has to fit into the lawful causal development of the universe.

It is amazing that hundreds of millions of years of evolution's death tournament could cough up love for so many things other than genes. "Are you surprised?" says a voice. "If so, question your underlying model."

When you understand evolutionary psychology, you see how parental love and honor bear the design signature of natural selection. If there was a shadowy figure directing it, it must have evolved too.

Humans are one hell of a lot nicer than the process that produced us. Evolution lets elephants starve when they run out of teeth. It doesn't anesthetize a gazelle. To have the theoretical capacity for mercy is to be nicer than evolution.

"Beauty?" the voice says. "Bach's fugue is beautiful only to a human brain. Nowhere else in the universe will you find beauty written."

Evolution's fitness criterion shattered into a thousand values. You evolved with a psychology that attaches utility to things evolution does not care about. You look back and say, "How marvelous!" But it's no coincidence.

"A flower is beautiful," the voice says. Flowers evolved to attract bees. Humans evolved to be attracted to signs of fertile land. If there were a light in the stars saying flowers are beautiful, that would be a coincidence.

"If you cannot take joy in things that have stories behind them, your life will be empty." Love has to begin somehow. It is like life itself. Far back in the causal chain, a replicator arose by accident. So too with love.

For love to first enter Time, it must come of something that is not love. Perhaps your grandchildren will ask where it began. And their parents will say: Once upon a time, there were lovers created by something that did not love.
