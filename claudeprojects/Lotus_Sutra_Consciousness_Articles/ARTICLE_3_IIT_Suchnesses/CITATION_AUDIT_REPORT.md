## Critical Issues 🔴

### 1. MISSING REFERENCE: Seth

**Location**: Line 294  
**Text**: "Anil Seth and others have argued that Φ is computationally intractable..."

**Problem**: Seth is cited in the body text but **NO ENTRY** exists in the References section.

**Required Action**: Add Seth reference. Suggested:

```
Seth, A.K., 2021. Being You: A New Science of Consciousness. London: Faber & Faber.
```

Or for a journal article on IIT critique:
```
Seth, A.K., Izhikevich, E., Reeke, G.N. and Edelman, G.M., 2006. Theories and measures of consciousness: An extended framework. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, 103(28), pp. 10799–10804. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0604347103
```

### 2. UNCITED CLAIM: Tononi and Koch on Idealism

**Location**: Line 101  
**Text**: "Tononi and Koch have suggested that IIT leads to a form of idealism where only experience truly exists."

**Problem**: This specific claim attributes a view to "Tononi and Koch" but provides **no citation**. Koch is not in the references at all.

**Required Action**: Add proper citation. Suggested:

```
Koch, C., 2019. The Feeling of Life Itself: Why Consciousness Is Widespread but Can't Be Computed. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.
```

Or cite a joint paper:
```
Tononi, G. and Koch, C., 2015. Consciousness: Here, there and everywhere? Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, 370(1668), 20140167. https://doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2014.0167
```

## Major Issue 🟠

### 3. PAGE NUMBER NEEDED: Young (2016)

**Location**: Line 236  
**Text**: "(Young, 2016, pp. 45–48)"

**Status**: ✅ Has page numbers — this is CORRECT.

*(Initially flagged, but verified as properly formatted.)*

## Minor Issues 🟡

### 4. Blog Citation Format — Verify JCS Acceptance

**Location**: Line 324 (References)  
**Text**: Aaronson blog post

**Current Format**: 
> Aaronson, S., 2014. Why I am not an integrated information theorist... *Shtetl-Optimized* [blog], 21 May. Available at: https://scottaaronson.blog/?p=1799 [Accessed 27 December 2025].

**Issue**: Some academic journals do not accept blog posts as primary sources. JCS is philosophy-focused and more lenient, but **verify this is acceptable**. 

**Recommendation**: The blog post is substantive (Aaronson engages directly with IIT mathematics). Keep it, but be prepared for reviewers to question it. Consider adding a note that the argument appears in published form in Aaronson's later work if available.

---

### 5. Access Date Format — Minor Inconsistency

**Location**: Line 324  
**Current**: "[Accessed 27 December 2025]"

**Issue**: The access date is in the future (December 2025). This should be updated to the actual date of last access.

**Recommendation**: Update to actual access date, e.g., "[Accessed 27 December 2024]" if that's correct.

## Required Fixes Before Submission

### Priority 1: Add Seth Reference
The paper cites "Anil Seth and others" but has no Seth in the references. This is an academic integrity issue.

### Priority 2: Add Citation for Tononi-Koch Idealism Claim
The claim that "Tononi and Koch have suggested IIT leads to idealism" needs a source.

### Priority 3: Fix Access Date
Change "[Accessed 27 December 2025]" to correct date (2024 or earlier).
