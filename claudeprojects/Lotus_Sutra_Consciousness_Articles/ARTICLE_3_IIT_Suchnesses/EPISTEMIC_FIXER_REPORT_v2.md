## I. Audit Triage

| Finding | Severity | Pattern to Apply |
|---------|----------|------------------|
| "Structural resonance" undefined | 🟡 Moderate | Pattern E: Operationalizing Curiosity-Stoppers |
| Wheeler citation unused | 🟡 Moderate | Pattern D: Addressing Missing Citations |
| No overall confidence calibration | 🟢 Minor | Pattern B: Adding Falsification Conditions |

## II. Specific Repairs

### Repair 1: Operationalize "Structural Resonance" (Pattern E)

**Location**: Section 1, paragraph 4 (line 19)

**Original**:
> "The goal is to explore whether both frameworks converge on similar structural constraints—and what that convergence might mean."

**Revised**:
> "The goal is to explore whether both frameworks converge on similar structural constraints—and what that convergence might mean. By 'structural resonance' I mean specifically this: both frameworks independently require that consciousness be (a) integrated/irreducible, (b) bounded/exclusionary, and (c) specific/differentiated. If these are genuine constraints on any adequate theory of consciousness, then the convergence is predicted; if they are merely artifacts of how humans happen to theorize, the convergence is coincidence."

**Logic**: Provides an operational definition that makes the claim testable.

### Repair 2: Integrate Wheeler Citation (Pattern D)

**Location**: Section 6.4 (line 192)

**Original**:
> "This is speculative. But it suggests a potential bridge between IIT formalism and contemplative phenomenology: both are concerned with the boundaries of consciousness, and both recognize that those boundaries may not be fixed."

**Revised**:
> "This is speculative. But it connects to a broader tradition in physics and philosophy. Wheeler (1990) proposed that the universe is a 'self-excited circuit'—observers participate in constituting the reality they observe. If consciousness boundaries are malleable, then what counts as 'self' and 'other' may be a matter of informational integration, not fixed anatomy. Both IIT formalism and contemplative phenomenology converge on this insight: the boundaries of consciousness may not be fixed."

**Logic**: Integrates the Wheeler citation from the bibliography into the argument, strengthening the theoretical bridge.

### Repair 3: Add Confidence Calibration to Conclusion (Pattern B)

**Location**: Section 8, final paragraph (line 234)

**Original**:
> "Whether that 'something' is a feature of mind, a feature of reality, or merely a feature of how minds conceptualize themselves remains an open question—one that neither Buddhist contemplatives nor computational neuroscientists have definitively answered."

**Revised**:
> "Whether that 'something' is a feature of mind, a feature of reality, or merely a feature of how minds conceptualize themselves remains an open question—one that neither Buddhist contemplatives nor computational neuroscientists have definitively answered. I hold the core thesis—that these convergences reflect genuine constraints rather than coincidence—with roughly 60% confidence. Readers with different priors about cross-cultural comparison should calibrate accordingly."

**Logic**: Provides explicit uncertainty quantification, allowing readers to weight the claims appropriately.

## III. No Sections to Add

The paper already includes:
- ✅ Falsification conditions (Section 5.3)
- ✅ Objections and Responses (Section 3.4, 7.3)
- ✅ Definitions/Glossary (integrated throughout)

---

## IV. Implementation Complete

All three repairs are ready for integration into the manuscript.

**Summary of Changes**:
1. Added operational definition of "structural resonance" in Introduction
2. Integrated Wheeler citation into Section 6.4
3. Added 60% confidence calibration to Conclusion
