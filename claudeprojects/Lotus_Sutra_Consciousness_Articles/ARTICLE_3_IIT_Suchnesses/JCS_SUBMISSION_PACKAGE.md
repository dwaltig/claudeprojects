**Subject:** Manuscript Submission — "The Ten Suchnesses and Integrated Information Theory"

Dear Mr. Horswell,

I am pleased to submit the attached manuscript, "The Ten Suchnesses and Integrated Information Theory: Structural Parallels Between Tiantai Buddhism and Consciousness Science," for consideration in the *Journal of Consciousness Studies*.

This article examines structural resonances between Tiantai Buddhism's Ten Suchnesses and Integrated Information Theory 4.0. The central claim is that both frameworks independently converge on similar structural requirements for consciousness: integration (irreducibility to parts), boundedness (definite phenomenal borders), and specificity (differentiation from other possible experiences).

**Key contributions:**

1. **Structural mapping**: A systematic comparison of IIT's five axioms with the Ten Suchnesses, identifying where parallels are philosophically nontrivial and where they fail.

2. **Narrative analysis**: Two Lotus Sutra passages interpreted as models of consciousness dynamics—the Dragon Girl's enlightenment as phase transition and Wonderful Sound's samādhis as boundary dissolution.

3. **Epistemic rigor**: Explicit falsification conditions (Section 7), response to standard IIT objections (Aaronson, Block, Seth), and acknowledgment of irreducible differences between frameworks.

4. **Calibrated confidence**: The thesis is held at approximately 60% confidence, inviting reader calibration based on differing priors about cross-cultural comparison.

**Word count:** ~5,700 words (including references)

**AI policy compliance:** This manuscript was developed with AI assistance for drafting and revision. All substantive intellectual content represents the original scholarship of the author. Full disclosure is included in the manuscript.

I confirm this work is original and not under review elsewhere.

Sincerely,

## 150-Word Summary (for manuscript header)

This article argues that Tiantai Buddhism's Ten Suchnesses and Integrated Information Theory 4.0 exhibit structural resonance: both frameworks independently require that consciousness be integrated, bounded, and irreducible. The Ten Suchnesses achieve this through the category of "Ultimate Equality"; IIT achieves it through the measure Φ. The paper maps structural parallels, examines two Lotus Sutra narratives as illustrations (the Dragon Girl's instantaneous enlightenment as phase transition, the Bodhisattva Wonderful Sound as phenomenological boundary dissolution), and addresses how the comparison fares under standard IIT objections. The claim is not that ancient Buddhists anticipated modern neuroscience, nor that IIT is empirically confirmed by Buddhist texts. The claim is more modest: if radically different traditions converge on similar structural requirements for consciousness, this may indicate genuine constraints on the conceptual space. Confidence in this thesis is approximately 60%.
