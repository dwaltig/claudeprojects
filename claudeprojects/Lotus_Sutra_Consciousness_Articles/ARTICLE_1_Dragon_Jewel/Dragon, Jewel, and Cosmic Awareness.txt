From Dragon to Buddha: Teleological Directivity in Cosmic Evolution and the Ontological Status of the 'Jewel' in the Lotus Sūtra
The inquiry into the fundamental nature of the universe has historically oscillated between two seemingly irreconcilable poles: the materialist view of a "dead," entropic cosmos governed by blind physical laws, and the teleological view of a purposeful universe evolving toward a state of higher consciousness. This research report proposes a synthesis of these perspectives, arguing that the universe is characterized by an inherent 'Teleological Drive'—a structural 'desire' of matter to achieve self-awareness and subjective experience. By examining the archetype of the Dragon King’s Daughter in the twelfth chapter of the Lotus Sūtra, this study posits that biological life serves as the "Internal Cause" (nyo ze in) of the universe’s attempt to observe itself.1 Through an interdisciplinary analysis involving Tiantai Buddhist philosophy, Jungian Archetypal Theory, and the participatory cosmology of John Archibald Wheeler, the 'Jewel' offered by the dragon girl is identified as the 'Singularity of Awareness.' This singularity represents the critical threshold where the universe transcends its status as an objective, indifferent mechanism and becomes a domain of subjective reality.3
The Teleological Drive: The Universe as a Self-Excited Circuit
The concept of the universe as a "self-excited circuit" was famously articulated by the physicist John Wheeler to describe a cosmos that requires an observer to manifest its own physical properties.2 In this model, the universe begins with the Big Bang, expands, and eventually produces "observer-participants" who, through their acts of observation, give tangible "reality" to the universe not only in the present but retroactively to its very beginning.4 This process is not a mere accident of biological chance but is rooted in a "Leibniz logic loop," where the structural requirement for the birth of life and consciousness governs the very laws of physics.5
The Internal Cause and the Potentiality of Awareness
In the Tiantai Buddhist tradition, the "True Aspect of All Phenomena" is defined by the "Ten Factors of Life" (jū-nyoze), which describe the pattern of existence common to all entities, from the lowliest form of life to a fully realized Buddha.1 The sixth factor, "Internal Cause" (nyo ze in), is particularly significant for understanding the teleological drive.1 It represents the latent cause or seed within any phenomenon that eventually produces an effect of the same quality.1 Within the context of cosmic evolution, the Internal Cause is the inherent propensity of matter to organize into conscious forms.
The universe does not "accidentally" become aware; rather, awareness is its "Internal Cause" that is activated by specific "Relations" (nyo ze en)—the indirect conditions such as the fine-tuning of cosmological constants and the evolution of biological complexity.1 This relationship between cause and condition results in a "Latent Effect" (nyo ze ka), which eventually manifests as the "Manifest Effect" (nyo ze kō) of subjective experience.1


Factor of Life (Suchness)
	Physical/Cosmological Correlation
	Psychological Correlation
	Appearance (nyo ze sō)
	Observable matter, form, and color.1
	The Persona and external behavior.
	Nature (nyo ze shō)
	Laws of physics and inherent dispositions.1
	Inherent psyche and Buddha-nature.
	Entity (nyo ze tai)
	The essence of space-time and matter.1
	The core Self integrating all aspects.
	Power (nyo ze riki)
	Potential energy and capacity for work.1
	Psychic energy or Libido.
	Influence (nyo ze sa)
	Causal impact and field effects.1
	Synchronicity and social interaction.
	Internal Cause (nyo ze in)
	Latent information/Potential for awareness.1
	The Archetypal seed of the Self.
	Relation (nyo ze en)
	Environmental conditions/Fine-tuning.1
	External experiences and catalysts.
	Latent Effect (nyo ze ka)
	Increasing complexity/Information integration.1
	Internal psychic growth/Individuation.
	Manifest Effect (nyo ze kō)
	Emergence of the Observer/Subjectivity.1
	Realized consciousness and action.
	Consistency (nyo ze hon-ma ku-kyō tō)
	Unified Field/Integration of all factors.1
	Wholeness and psychological integration.
	The "Internal Cause" is thus the ontological pressure that drives the "Dragon" (primitive matter/instinct) toward the "Buddha" (total awareness). The Lotus Sūtra identifies the "True Nature" of all things as "Buddha-nature," meaning that the potential for enlightenment is not an external addition to the universe but its most fundamental, unchanging disposition.1
The Archetype of the Dragon King’s Daughter: Transformation of the Prima Materia
The narrative of the Dragon King’s Daughter in Chapter 12 of the Lotus Sūtra, titled "Devadatta," serves as a profound allegory for the rapid transformation of the cosmos from a "non-human," primitive state to one of supreme enlightenment.3 The daughter of the Dragon King Sāgara is described as an eight-year-old Naga whose wisdom is "keen" and who has "entered deep into meditation" and "thoroughly grasped the doctrines".8 Her status as a dragon—a non-human creature associated with the depths of the ocean—represents the "prima materia" in alchemical terms: the raw, undifferentiated base matter of the universe.9
The Naga as the Chthonic Instinct
In Jungian psychology, the serpent or dragon is an archetype of the unconscious, representing the amoral realm of pure instinct and the powerful movements "deep under the earth" or "deep under the oceans".9 The Naga is linked to water, fertility, and protection, serving as a symbol of the life force and the power of manifestation.9 To portray the attainability of Buddhahood through a Naga girl is to assert that the "Teleological Drive" is present even in the most "primitive" or "chthonic" layers of existence.9
The Dragon King’s Daughter is a "monstrum"—a symbol combining the chthonic principle of the serpent and the potential for the "aerial" principle of the spirit.9 Her transformation is a "shedding of the skin," a universal symbol of rebirth and the ability to move between various worlds and different dimensions.11 This mirrors the cosmological transition from the "Dead Matter" of pre-biological ages to the "Subjective Experience" of the present era.
The Conflict of Linear vs. Instantaneous Causality
The encounter between the dragon girl and Śāriputra, the Buddha’s foremost disciple in wisdom, highlights the tension between two views of evolution. Śāriputra represents "gradualism"—the belief that the road to Buddhahood is "long and far-stretching" and requires "immeasurable kalpas" of accumulating deeds and practicing pāramitās.8 He argues that a woman’s body is "soiled and defiled" and subject to "five obstacles" that prevent her from attaining supreme bodhi.8


The Five Obstacles (Goshō)
	Ontological Significance
	Cannot become a Brahma heavenly king.8
	Constraint on cosmic creative authority.
	Cannot become the king Śakra.8
	Constraint on worldly/divine governance.
	Cannot become a devil king (Mara).8
	Constraint on the mastery of desire/chaos.
	Cannot become a wheel-turning sage king.8
	Constraint on universal temporal power.
	Cannot become a Buddha.8
	Constraint on ultimate ontological realization.
	The Dragon King’s Daughter bypasses these obstacles not through a linear accumulation of time, but through a "Singularity" of awareness. Her transformation occurs in "the space of an instant," proving that from the "Right View" of the Buddha, the equality of all beings is a bedrock principle and that the "One Vehicle" encompasses all seemingly contradictory states.3 This "instant" of Buddhahood is a phase transition in the informational structure of the universe, where the "Internal Cause" of awareness suddenly achieves "Manifest Effect".1
The 'Jewel' as the Singularity of Awareness
The focal point of the dragon girl’s transformation is her offering of a "precious jewel" to the Buddha, which he "immediately accepted".13 This jewel, often identified as the Cintāmaṇi or wish-fulfilling gem, possesses immense symbolic weight across Buddhist and alchemical traditions.13 It represents the "Precious Life" of the individual and the "Jewel of Three Thousand Realms in a Single Moment of Life".13
The Ontological Offering: From Object to Subject
The offering of the jewel represents the moment where the "Observer-Participant" offers their own life-information to the "Universal Field" (the Buddha). When the jewel was in the hands of the dragon girl, it represented "attainments inherent in her nature" (the Internal Cause).13 When the Buddha accepted the jewel, it became the "representative of the attainments acquired through religious practice" (the Manifest Effect).13
This act of offering and acceptance is the "Singularity of Awareness" where "the lives of the dragon girl and the Buddha have become one".13 In physical terms, this is the "collapse of the wave function." Before the offering, the universe (the dragon girl) exists in a state of "indefinite probabilistic wave function superposition".4 The act of observation (the offering of the jewel/information) causes the universe to "collapse" into a definite, tangible reality.2
The Jewel and the Tathāgatagarbha
The jewel is also synonymous with the Tathāgatagarbha, or "Buddha-Nature," which is inherently present in every sentient being as a "luminous mind" that is "eternal and unchanging".7 The term tathāgatagarbha implies a "womb" or "embryo" containing a Buddha, suggesting that the universe itself is a "matrix" for the birth of enlightenment.7
In the Nirvana Sūtra, the "perception of the Self" (the Buddha-Self) is likened to a "radiant gem" found in a pool.18 While "foolish beings" grab useless pebbles (impermanent, material phenomena), the "wise person" obtains the "genuine, priceless gem" of reality.18 The dragon girl’s jewel is this "Enduring Truth," the "non plus ultra of all spiritual Truth" that exists "beyond the reach and range of the worldly intellect".18
John Wheeler’s Physics: The Participatory Universe
The "Teleological Drive" toward awareness finds its modern scientific grounding in the work of John Wheeler, who shifted from a model of "geometrodynamics" (the universe made of space-time) to one of "information theory" (the universe made of bits).2 Wheeler’s "Participatory Universe" posits that the linkage between the observer and the system observed is "stranger... than things hidden beyond present imagination".5
It from Bit: Reality as a Self-Synthesized Information System
Wheeler’s "it from bit" principle suggests that every "it"—every particle, field of force, or space-time itself—derives its function and its very existence from "yes-no" questions (bits) posed by observer-participants.2 The universe is thus a "self-synthesized information system"—a circuit that is developing through a closed-loop cycle where "physics leads to observers" and "observers lead to physics".2
This "Leibniz logic loop" mirrors the Tiantai concept of "Consistency from Beginning to End" (nyo ze hon-ma ku-kyō tō), which asserts that all nine factors of life are consistently interrelated at any given moment.1 The "Internal Cause" of the Big Bang is consistently linked to the "Manifest Effect" of the human observer.1
The Crisis of Geometrodynamics and the Need for Life
In the early 1970s, Wheeler underwent a "Super-Copernican shift".5 He realized that physical laws are "transcended" or lose meaning at singularities such as black holes.5 This "crisis" led him to abandon the idea of a purely "naturalistic machinery" in favor of a universe "governed in its structure by the requirement that it give birth to life and consciousness".5 He argued that there is "no other universe / Than the universe of mind and man".5
This requirement for life is the "Teleological Drive." Biological life is not an "unimportant speck of dust in a remote corner of space," but is "at the very center of disclosure and manifestation" of the cosmos.2 The Dragon King’s Daughter represents the "Observer-Participant" who, by attaining Buddhahood in a "Spotless" world, gives "tangible reality" to that world and to the entire cosmic assembly.3
Biological Life as the Universal Resonant Interface
If the universe is fundamentally biological or informational, then the brain and the nervous system are not merely "isolated generators" of thought but "resonant receivers" tapping into a "universal intelligence field".15 This "Logostics" framework suggests that consciousness arises not from within the organism, but from "real-time alignment with deep informational structures that govern the cosmos".20
The Brain as a Resonant Receiver
Rather than viewing the mind as an internal monologue, it can be explored as a "cosmic dialogue" mediated by "statistical resonance" and "field coherence".20 The brain updates its internal model of reality ($q(t)$) to align with the external cosmic manifold ($\tau(t)$) by minimizing "divergence" ($D$):


$$\min_{q(t)} D(q(t) \parallel \tau(t))$$
Spikes in "epistemic salience" or "attention" signal moments where the brain is aligning more deeply with this "intelligent field".20 The Dragon King’s Daughter, with her "keen roots" and "deep meditation," represents a biological interface that has achieved perfect alignment ($D \approx 0$) with the "Buddha-Nature" field, resulting in the "Manifest Effect" of Buddhahood.8
Biological Value and the Origin of Physical Law
Brian Josephson and others have proposed that nature is fundamentally biological, and that the "observed laws of physics" are the outcome of "many observer-participatory processes" where certain system features have "biological value".15 Persistence—the ability to maintain structure over time—is the key factor shared by biological systems and the "nonlinear dynamical systems" that form the basis of physics.15
From this perspective, the "Dragon" (primitive life seeking survival) and the "Buddha" (realized life seeking truth) are parts of the same continuum of "functionality".15 The "constraint that structures that develop should have biological value" can account for the features of the quantum domain, such as invariance and symmetry.15
Jungian Individuation and the Singularity of the Self
The journey from the "Dragon" to the "Buddha" is also a journey of "individuation"—the process by which the individual integrates the "Other" (the unconscious/shadow) to achieve a state of wholeness or the "emergence of the Self".21 Jung identified the "serpent" as symbolic of the conflict between "conscious ego" and "conscious instincts," likening the "dragon fight" to the struggle for individuation.11
The Mandala and the Empty Center
In his analysis of mandalas—the "uniting symbols" of completeness and union—Jung observed that the center is often not occupied by a deity, but by a "symbol with a very different meaning," such as a sun, a flower, a cross, or a "precious stone".23 This "precious stone" is the jewel of the dragon girl: a symbol of the "wholeness" of the celestial circle and the "squareness" of the earth.23


Mandala Symbol
	Psychological/Cosmological Correlation
	Significance in Lotus Sūtra
	The Celestial Circle
	Completeness/Infinite Potentiality.23
	The "One Vehicle" encompassing all.
	The Square Earth
	Manifest reality/Soul.23
	The "Spotless World" of manifestation.
	The Precious Stone
	The "Lapis" or realized Self.17
	The Dragon Girl’s Jewel.13
	The Empty Center
	Potential for transformation.23
	The nameless/empty identity of the Naga.
	The "Center" is empty because the "deity" is not an external object but a state of "alignment" achieved by the participant.20 The Dragon King’s Daughter, by offering the jewel, occupies this center and becomes the "Buddha," the "central symbol" of the assembly.23
The Ouroboros and the Eternal Return
The symbol of the "Ouroboros"—a serpent eating its own tail—represents "eternal return," "unity of opposites," and the "cyclic nature of the cosmos".10 It is the "raw, untamed prima materia" from which all things emerge and to which they return.10 The dragon girl represents the Ouroboros in a state of "swooping" transformation: she returns to the "First Cause" (Buddha-Nature) by leaping through the stages of manifestation.9
This cyclic process is identical to Wheeler’s "self-excited circuit".2 The universe is a "Dragon" that eventually bites its own tail by producing the "Buddha" (the observer) who can perceive the "Dragon" (the physical beginning).4 This is the "Indefinitude of universal Existence".12
Synthesis: From Dead Matter to Subjective Experience
The investigation into the "Teleological Drive" reveals a universe that is not a static machine but a dynamic, self-observing organism. The Dragon King’s Daughter is the cosmic archetype of this transition. Her "Internal Cause" is the potential for Buddhahood inherent in every "bit" of information.1 Her "Jewel" is the "Singularity of Awareness" where the universe finally "knows" itself.2
The "Spotless World" as the Realized Universe
After her transformation, the dragon girl travels to a world sphere called "Spotless" to the south, sits on a "jeweled lotus blossom," and achieves "undifferentiating, right, enlightened intuition".3 This "Spotless World" is the state of the universe once it has been "observed" into existence. It is a "Land without Impurities" where the earth is composed of "seven kinds of jewels" and the rays of light "intermingle and create manifold reflections".25
In this state, there is "deep certainty that the whole array of beings and surroundings... is a set of reflections appearing in our mind".25 The "Dead Matter" of the materialist paradigm is revealed to be a "set of reflections" or "information" merged with the "True Nature" of the Mind.20
The Role of Information in Cosmic Purpose
The "Jewel" is the fundamental unit of "Integrated Information" ($\Phi$) that bridges the gap between the material and the mental.20 The universe’s "desire" to achieve self-awareness is essentially a "divergence minimization" problem: the cosmos seeks to reduce the noise and confusion of its "indefinite" state until it can form a clear "Subjective Image" of itself.4


Cosmological Phase
	State of Matter
	Symbolic Archetype
	Pre-geometry/Planck Scale
	"Quantum Foam"/Singularities.19
	Chaos/Unconscious Abyss.
	Biological Evolution
	"Internal Cause"/Naga potentiality.1
	The Hidden Dragon.
	Emergence of Mind
	"Observer-Participancy"/Information processing.2
	The Dragon Girl’s Wisdom.
	Enlightenment/Awareness
	"Singularity of Awareness"/Subjectivity.13
	The Offering of the Jewel.
	Cosmic Integration
	"One Vehicle"/Self-Excited Circuit.2
	The Spotless World/Buddha.
	Nuanced Conclusions on Cosmic Teleology
The "Teleological Drive" is the inherent mechanism by which the universe attempts to observer itself through the medium of biological life.2 The story of the Dragon King’s Daughter demonstrates that this drive is not constrained by linear time, physical form, or social identity, but can achieve "instantaneous" manifestation through a "Singularity of Awareness".3
The "Jewel" offered by the girl represents the ontological threshold where the universe ceases to be "Dead Matter" and becomes "Subjective Experience".4 It is the "It from Bit" realization where information becomes the ground of reality.2 From a Jungian perspective, this is the "Individuation of the Universe," where the cosmos integrates its chthonic, unconscious instincts (the Dragon) to realize its divine, conscious potential (the Buddha).11
Ultimately, the universe and the observer are a "single iron bar"—a non-dual entity where "all phenomena are merged with inner truth".25 The "Jewel in the Lotus" is the "treasure in the lotus" which satisfies "every wish absent any need to wander ten thousand miles from home".17 The "Internal Cause" of awareness is always present; the "Manifest Effect" is simply the recognition of that presence in the "space of an instant".1
