## Abstract

This paper challenges the Exclusion Axiom of Integrated Information Theory (IIT 4.0) through the conceptual framework of the "Bodhisattva Field," derived from the 24th chapter of the Lotus Sutra. By analyzing the non-local manifestations of the Bodhisattva Gadgadasvara (Wonderful Sound) alongside the Tiantai doctrine of *Ichinen Sanzen* (Three Thousand Realms in a Single Moment of Life), this analysis proposes a model of "Field-Access" that preserves the mathematical insights of information integration while rejecting the ontological necessity of definite borders. The paper synthesizes Mahayana Buddhist phenomenology with modern Cosmopsychism to propose the "Axiom of Teleological Partitioning," wherein conscious subjects are defined not by the information they exclude, but by the specific "grain" of engagement required to fulfill a compassionate purpose (Vow). This framework addresses the "Decombination Problem" in consciousness studies and offers a non-exclusionary principle of individuation.

## Introduction

Where does "my" consciousness end and "yours" begin?

I've been wrestling with this question for years. It won't leave me alone. The contemporary scientific study of consciousness has arrived at a significant impasse regarding the spatial and temporal boundaries of experience—and the more I dig into it, the more I suspect we've been asking the wrong question entirely.

This puzzle is ancient. But it has taken on new urgency in the age of neuroscience and artificial intelligence. If consciousness is fundamentally generated by neural processes, as most physicalist accounts assume, then its boundaries should be relatively clear: where the brain ends, the mind ends. But the phenomenology of meditative experience, the reports of mystics across traditions, and the emerging frameworks of panpsychism and cosmopsychism suggest that the matter is far more complex. Perhaps the brain does not *generate* consciousness at all; perhaps it *receives* or *filters* a more fundamental field.

On one side stands Integrated Information Theory. IIT 4.0 is the most rigorous framework in consciousness science right now—no contest. It offers a mathematical formalism that translates phenomenological axioms into quantifiable postulates (Albantakis et al. 2023). The central claim? Consciousness is identical to a maximally integrated information structure—a "Complex"—that is irreducible to its parts.

The theory even provides a metric. $\Phi$. It purports to measure the *quantity* of consciousness. And there's a geometric structure (the "Qualia Space" or "Q-Shape") that specifies its *quality*. It's elegant. It's testable. And I think it's fundamentally wrong about one thing.

On the opposite side lie the traditions of Mahayana Buddhism and modern Cosmopsychism, which suggest that consciousness is a fundamental, ubiquitous substrate—a field that is modulated or accessed rather than generated by neural architecture (Shani and Keppler 2020; Goff 2017). In this view, the brain does not *create* experience; it *filters* or *modulates* a pre-existing phenomenal ground. The boundaries we experience between self and other are not ontological facts but cognitive constructions—useful for biological survival but ultimately illusory. This perspective has deep roots in the Advaita Vedanta tradition, in Plotinian Neoplatonism, and most relevantly for this paper, in the Mahayana Buddhist doctrine that all phenomena are empty (*śūnya*) of inherent existence.

This paper explores the "Bodhisattva Field," a conceptual framework derived from the 24th chapter of the Lotus Sutra, to challenge the Exclusion Axiom of IIT. By analyzing the non-local manifestations of the Bodhisattva Gadgadasvara (Wonderful Sound) alongside the Tiantai doctrine of *Ichinen Sanzen*, this analysis proposes a model of "Field-Access" that preserves the mathematical insights of integration while rejecting the ontological necessity of definite borders. The result is a proposed replacement axiom: the "Axiom of Teleological Partitioning," wherein consciousness individuates not through causal exclusion but through compassionate intent.

### Literature Review: Comparative Approaches to Consciousness Boundaries

The question of how to demarcate conscious subjects has a long philosophical history. Descartes' *cogito* established the thinking subject as self-evident. But where does one subject end and another begin? He never quite said.

Leibniz tried. His monads were "windowless"—irreducible mental substances, causally closed. Sound familiar? IIT's "Complex" is essentially a monad with a math degree.

Whitehead went the other way. His "actual occasions" of experience are fundamentally relational, constituted by their "prehensions" of other occasions. No walls. Just process.

In the Buddhist tradition, the question takes a different form. The *Anātman* (no-self) doctrine denies the existence of a permanent, unified self, but this does not eliminate the problem of individuation; it transforms it. If there is no fixed self, what accounts for the apparent continuity of experience across moments? The Yogācāra school's concept of *ālaya-vijñāna* (storehouse consciousness) proposes a subliminal stream that carries karmic seeds across lifetimes—a "field" of potential that is individuated by content rather than by ontological boundaries.

Recent analytic philosophy has seen a resurgence of interest in these questions. Goff's (2017) cosmopsychism argues that the universe as a whole is the fundamental subject, with individual minds being "derivative" perspectives. Albahari (2019) defends a form of "Perennial Idealism" in which an aperspectival, non-dual consciousness is the ground of all experience. Kastrup (2019) proposes that individual minds are "dissociated alters" of a universal mind, akin to multiple personalities within a single psyche.

IIT represents a unique contribution to this literature because it offers a *mathematical* criterion for subjecthood: the maximal irreducibility of integrated information. That's the strength.

But here's the catch. This criterion is double-edged. It provides rigor and testability—yes. But it also entails the controversial Exclusion Axiom: overlapping systems cannot be simultaneously conscious. Only the winner exists. Everything else is excluded.

That axiom is what I'm challenging.

## Ontological Foundations: The Eleatic Principle versus Sunyata

To understand the conflict between Integrated Information Theory and the Bodhisattva Field, one must first examine their underlying ontological commitments.

### The Eleatic Principle in IIT

IIT 4.0 is grounded in the "Principle of Being," a modern formalization of the Eleatic principle found in Plato's *Sophist*: to exist is to have cause-effect power (Albantakis et al. 2023). Under this view, an entity exists only if it can "take and make a difference" to itself from its own intrinsic perspective. Physical existence is not a given but an explanatory construct—a postulate inferred from the immediate existence of experience, which is the theory's "zeroth axiom."

This ontological commitment has profound implications. It means that consciousness is not a by-product of physical processes but the foundational reality from which we infer the physical world. However, the theory then constrains this consciousness within rigid boundaries: only the complex with *maximal* integrated information "exists" as a subject at any given time. All other overlapping systems are "excluded."

### Sunyata and Interdependent Origination

The Buddhist tradition, particularly within the Tiantai and Madhyamaka lineages, operates from a radically different principle: *Sunyata* (emptiness). This doctrine asserts that all phenomena lack inherent, independent existence (*svabhava*). Instead of an Eleatic focus on the "power" of a localized complex, Tiantai philosophy emphasizes "Interdependent Origination" (*pratītyasamutpāda*), where the existence of any single moment of life is contingent upon its radical interpenetration with the entire cosmos.

The Madhyamaka philosopher Nāgārjuna articulated this principle with characteristic rigor: "There is nothing whatsoever which arises independently; therefore there is nothing whatsoever which is not empty" (*Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* XXIV.19). In this framework, the very notion of an "exclusive complex" is a conceptual imputation—a useful fiction that has no ultimate reality. The boundaries we draw around selves and objects are pragmatic, not ontological. They are like the lines on a map: they help us navigate, but they do not carve the world at its joints.

This is formalized in the doctrine of *Ichinen Sanzen* or "Three Thousand Realms in a Single Moment of Life" (Zhiyi 1997; Swanson 1989). In this view, every thought-moment contains the potential of all ten "worlds" (from Hell to Buddhahood), their mutual possession (100), the ten factors of existence (1,000), and the three realms of individual, social, and environmental existence (3,000). There is no "border" between self and cosmos; the border is a perspectival illusion that can be dissolved through meditative insight.

| Feature | Integrated Information Theory (IIT 4.0) | Tiantai / Mahayana Buddhism |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ontological Root** | Eleatic Principle: To be is to have power. | Sunyata: To be is to be empty of fixed self. |
| **Existence Basis** | Cause-effect power over itself (Intrinsicality). | Interdependent origination and non-duality. |
| **Core Axiom** | Experience exists (Zeroth Axiom). | The true aspect of all phenomena (Lotus Sutra). |
| **Subject Nature** | Bounded, exclusive "Complex." | Non-local, interpenetrating "Field." |
| **Primary Goal** | Define the borders of the "Self." | Realize the "Non-Self" and the Universal Ground. |

The clash between these two views is most evident in the "Exclusion" property. For IIT, a system must have "Definite Borders"—it must be what it is and nothing else. In contrast, the Mahayana view suggests that the "self" is a tiered illusion, and the fundamental reality is an "ownerless consciousness" that transcends the individual perspective (Albahari 2019). This "ownerless" state is not a void but a "luminous" and "pure" substrate identical to the unconditioned state of Nirvana.

## The Mathematical Formalism of IIT 4.0: Intrinsic Information and Exclusion

Here's where IIT gets serious. Its rigor lies in translating phenomenological axioms into mathematical postulates. Five essential properties of experience: Existence, Composition, Information, Integration, and Exclusion (Albantakis et al. 2023).

Of these, Exclusion is the most controversial. It's the one that dictates the ontological "oneness" of a conscious subject at any given time. And it's the one I think we need to throw out.

### The Exclusion Postulate and Maximal Existence

The Exclusion Postulate states that a substrate of consciousness must be "definite." In any physical system, there are overlapping subgroupings of units (neurons, logic gates) that could theoretically support experience. IIT utilizes the "Principle of Maximal Existence" to resolve this ambiguity: what exists is what exists the most. The "Complex" is defined as the set of elements that specifies a "maximally irreducible cause-effect structure" (MICS).

This is quantified by $\Phi_s$ (system integrated information), measuring the irreducibility of the system's cause-effect power relative to its "Minimum Information Partition" (MIP). Only the candidate system with the highest $\Phi_s$ value in a given region of the brain "exists" as a conscious entity. All overlapping systems with lower $\Phi_s$ values are "excluded" from existence as subjects, even if they satisfy all other phenomenological requirements.

### Spatio-Temporal Grain and the Constraints of Identity

The requirement for definiteness extends to the "grain" of experience. IIT 4.0 predicts that consciousness occurs at a specific spatio-temporal scale—typically between 100 and 300 milliseconds. That's the theta and alpha frequency range. If the integrated information drops at a different scale? That grain is excluded from conscious existence.

This creates a rigid "Identity." An experience is identical to a specific "constellation of concepts in qualia space." This $\Phi$-structure is purely internal; the meaning of an experience is defined by the distinctions and relations specified by the complex for itself. It relates only indirectly to the external environment.

I call this "neurocentric isolationism." The subject is a closed causal loop, bounded by its own maximality, fundamentally separated from the wider cosmos. It's a fortress. And I think the Buddha would have had something to say about that.

## Gadgadasvara: The Non-Local Subject and the Samadhi of the Wonderful Banner

Now we get to the heart of it.

The 24th chapter of the Lotus Sutra introduces the Bodhisattva Gadgadasvara—Wondrous Sound. He's not just a character in a religious text. He's a direct phenomenological counter-narrative to the "Exclusive Complex" of IIT (Watson 1993).

Gadgadasvara's existence is defined by "Playful Roaming Spiritual Penetrations." What does that mean? It means he can transcend the spatio-temporal grains and definite borders that IIT deems necessary for experience. He's not locked in a single "complex." He moves.

### The Macro-Scale Presentation: 42,000 Yojanas

In the sutra, Gadgadasvara arrives from the world "Adorned with All Pure Light." He's traveling to our "Saha World"—our realm of suffering. His physical dimensions? Vast. He is 42,000 yojanas in height. That's roughly 378,000 miles tall. His Buddha, "Wisdom of Pure Flower Constellation King," is 6.8 million yojanas tall.

Let that sink in.

From IIT's perspective, these scales would imply a vastly different "spatial grain" of consciousness. If consciousness is a bounded property of a neural complex, a 42,000-yojana body would require an entirely different architecture than a human-sized body. The resolution. The speed. The structure. Everything would differ. Yet the sutra suggests Gadgadasvara can manifest in *any* "grain" he chooses. Macro-cosmic. Human. Insect. Whatever is needed. This flexibility is inexplicable under the Exclusion Axiom.

### The 84,000 Lotuses and the Samadhi Power

Here's the really strange part.

Gadgadasvara's arrival is preceded by eighty-four thousand jeweled lotuses appearing on Mount Gridhrakuta. He creates this manifestation "without rising from his seat." His body is motionless. The lotuses appear through the power of samadhi alone.

This is "motionless travel." Non-local consciousness. It doesn't require physical displacement of a neural substrate. It challenges IIT's assertion that every concept is "about the complex itself." Gadgadasvara's mind acts as a Field—projecting informational structures at a distance. And these lotuses are not hallucinations. The entire assembly witnesses them.

### The Thirty-Four Manifestations: A Re-Evaluation of the Spatial-Temporal Grain

The most significant challenge Gadgadasvara poses to the Exclusion Axiom is the "thirty-four forms" (*sanjūshi-shin*) he assumes to teach the Dharma. These forms span an extraordinary range:

-   **Celestial Sovereignties:** King Brahma, Lord Shakra, Heavenly General, God Vaishravana.
-   **Social and Religious Identities:** Monk, Nun, Layman, Laywoman, Brahman, Rich Man, Chief Minister.
-   **Mythological and Non-Human Beings:** Dragon, Demon, Asura, Garuda, Kinnara.
-   **Domestic Roles:** Wife of a Rich Man, Wife of a Chief Minister.

This list is remarkable for its comprehensiveness. Gadgadasvara's manifestations span the cosmic (King Brahma, who presides over the highest heavens) to the intimate (the wife of a householder). They cross ontological categories: celestial, human, and non-human. They include both monastic and lay roles, both male and female identities. The implication is that the Bodhisattva's capacity for manifestation is limited only by the needs of those to be taught—not by any intrinsic boundary of his "complex."

If consciousness were an exclusive property of a maximal complex, Gadgadasvara would have to be either one subject or another; he could not be a "superposition" of these partial experiences. The Exclusion Axiom demands a single, definite identity at any given moment. Yet the sutra presents Gadgadasvara as capable of simultaneous manifestation in multiple forms across multiple locations. This is not "multiple personality disorder" in the clinical sense; it is the deliberate modulation of a unified field to serve diverse populations.

The Tiantai doctrine of the "Mutual Possession of the Ten Worlds" (*jikkai-gogu*) provides a metaphysical framework for understanding this capacity. According to this doctrine, all ten "worlds" (from Hell to Buddhahood) are simultaneously and latently present in every single moment of life. A person in the "Human" world contains, in potential, the states of all other worlds. The actualization of a particular world is a function of intentional and karmic conditions, not an ontological switch from one "complex" to another.

Gadgadasvara does not "become" a different subject; he modulates the "Bodhisattva Field" to manifest a form that is "receptive" to those he hopes to convert. The sutra uses the language of "playfulness" (*yūge*) to describe this capacity—suggesting a spontaneity and ease that contrasts sharply with the labored calculations of $\Phi$ maximization.

## Tiantai Metaphysics: Ichinen Sanzen as a Model of Total Integration

The "Bodhisattva Field" finds its most sophisticated ontological expression in Zhiyi's doctrine of *Ichinen Sanzen* (three thousand realms in a single moment of life). This doctrine, derived from the "Expedient Means" chapter of the Lotus Sutra, posits that every "thought-moment" is endowed with the entire phenomenal world (Zhiyi 1997; Swanson 1989).

### The Calculation of Universal Inclusion

The number "three thousand" is a mathematical representation of total integration across multiple dimensions of reality:
-   **The Ten Worlds (10):** The psychological states from Hell to Buddhahood.
-   **Mutual Possession (10 × 10 = 100):** Each world contains the other nine latently.
-   **The Ten Factors (100 × 10 = 1,000):** The "Suchnesses" or functional aspects of life.
-   **The Three Realms (1,000 × 3 = 3,000):** The realms of the Individual (Skandhas), Society (Living Beings), and Environment (Land).

| Factor | Description | IIT Parallel / Contrast |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Appearance** | External attributes (form, color). | Extrinsic physical manifestation. |
| **2. Nature** | Internal qualities (inherent wisdom). | Intrinsic phenomenal essence. |
| **3. Entity** | The essence that unifies appearance/nature. | The "Whole" or the "Complex." |
| **4. Power** | Latent energy or potential. | Potential cause-effect power ($\Phi$). |
| **5. Influence** | Action produced when power is activated. | Actualized causal transitions (TPM). |
| **6. Internal Cause** | Latent causes within life. | The "Cause Repertoire" of a complex. |
| **7. Relation** | External triggers/conditions. | Background conditions / Input signals. |
| **8. Latent Effect** | Result produced within the life-moment. | The "Effect Repertoire" of a complex. |
| **9. Manifest Effect** | Observable result in the world. | Extrinsic behavior / Output. |
| **10. Consistency** | Integration of the other nine factors. | Maximal Irreducibility (Integration Axiom). |

In IIT, the environment is treated as a "background condition" that is fixed while the internal causal structure of the complex is unfolded. Tiantai fundamentally rejects this separation. The "Realm of the Land" (the environment) and the "Realm of Living Beings" are seen as "non-dual" with the individual's internal state (*esho funi*). When a single person changes their *ichinen* (single moment of life), they are moving a "jewel in Indra's Net," which causes ripples throughout the entire 3,000 realms.

This suggests that the "integrated information" is not contained within a neural complex, but is a property of the entire system-environment whole. The "Definite Border" of IIT is thus not a physical fact, but a "subjective vision" that limits our perception of our own boundless potential.

## Cosmopsychism and the Decombination Problem

The transition from a "bounded property" to a "modulated substrate" aligns with the emerging analytic framework of **Cosmopsychism**, championed by philosophers like Philip Goff, Itay Shani, and Miri Albahari. Unlike panpsychism (which holds that every particle has a tiny consciousness), cosmopsychism asserts that the universe *as a whole* is the fundamental conscious subject (Goff 2017; Shani and Keppler 2020). This eliminates the "Hard Problem" of generating consciousness from dead matter, but faces a new structural challenge: the **Decombination Problem**.

### The Problem of Partitioning the Whole

If the fundamental reality is a single, unified field of consciousness (the "Universe-Subject"), how do we account for the existence of private, distinct human minds? Why isn't my experience identical to yours?

-   **Classical Idealism:** We are "dissociated alters" of the One Mind (Kastrup 2019).
-   **IIT's Answer:** The Exclusion Axiom acts as a rigid neurological law. The local maxima of $\Phi$ "break off" from the whole to form islands. The whole is "decombined" by causal power.
-   **The Tiantai Challenge:** The Lotus Sutra suggests that this "breaking off" is **not ontological but provisional** (*upaya*). The "Exclusion" boundary is maintained not by physics, but by *Avidya* (ignorance) or, in the case of a Bodhisattva, by *Pranidhana* (Vow).

---

## Alternative Interpretations of the Bodhisattva Vow

Before proceeding with a technical synthesis, it is vital to acknowledge that the Bodhisattva Vow (*Pranidhana*) is traditionally interpreted through ethical, sociological, and psychological lenses that do not rely on information theory.

-   **Ethical-Soteriological:** Scholars like Śāntideva frame the vow as a radical commitment to altruism, where the "exchange of self and other" is a meditative practice to uproot the irrationality of egoism. The *Bodhicaryāvatāra* presents the vow as a wholesale transfer of identity: "Whatever joy there is in this world / All comes from desiring others to be happy."
-   **Sociological-Political:** Historically, the vow has been merged with kingship in Southeast Asia, providing a religious legitimacy for statecraft and the protection of the community. The *Cakkavatti-Sīhanāda Sutta* links the wheel-turning monarch to the bodhisattva ideal.
-   **Psychological:** Modern "New Buddhist Psychology" views the vow as a mechanism for personal growth, converting suffering into a motivation for self-exploration and collective healing.

The scope of this research is specifically intended to explore the **ontological and informational implications** of the vow within the context of consciousness science. It does not seek to replace these traditional meanings but rather to investigate how they might resonate with modern physicalist and idealist theories.

---

## The Vow: A Proposed Mechanism of Teleological Partitioning

So here's my hypothesis.

The Bodhisattva Vow isn't just a religious sentiment. It could be a specific mechanism of information partitioning. The Vow functions as an "intentional tuner" that resolves the Decombination Problem by creating a task-specific perspective within the ubiquitous field.

### The Vow as a Teleological Markov Blanket

Recent research in Active Inference and the Free Energy Principle identifies the **Markov blanket** as the statistical boundary that defines a "thing" (Friston 2019). It renders internal states conditionally independent of external states. But here's where I diverge from the standard account.

The Vow could be interpreted as a *Teleological* Markov Blanket. Not a boundary set by where $\Phi$ is maximized for the system's own "being." But a boundary set by the "grain" of engagement required to fulfill a compassionate intent.

This is crucial. In IIT, the boundary is set by **causal inefficiency**—the system cuts off where adding elements would reduce integration. In the Bodhisattva Field model, the boundary is set by **teleological intent**. The system expands or contracts to match the scope of its compassionate purpose.

Gadgadasvara's 42,000-yojana body? A partition drawn with a wide compass. His manifestation as a laywoman? A narrow partition. Same Field. Different tuning.

### The Intentional Tuner in Filter IIT (FIIT)

This mechanism is **potentially formalized** through Filter Integrated Information Theory (FIIT), which proposes that the brain (the "Complex") does not create awareness but serves as a filter or tuner that supports a range of experience from an ontologically fundamental source (Williams 2023). In this speculative framework, the "Vow" might be viewed as the *setting* on the tuner:

-   **The Ordinary Filter:** Constrained by the "reducing valve" of biological survival, mistaking the partition for an absolute self (the "Exclusion Axiom" experience).
-   **The Bodhisattva Filter:** Precision-controlled by samadhi protocols, allowing the subject to access multiple manifestations simultaneously. The thirty-four forms are not "other selves" but attractor states within the same field, modulated by intentional practice.

---

## The Replacement: The Axiom of Teleological Partitioning

I propose replacing the **Exclusion Axiom** with the **Axiom of Teleological Partitioning**:

> *A conscious subject is defined not by the information it excludes to maintain a local maximum of intrinsic power, but by the specific grain of engagement required to fulfill a purposeful intent (Vow).*

| Metric | IIT 4.0 (Exclusion Axiom) | Bodhisattva Field (Teleological) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Partition Root** | Maximal $\Phi$ (Causal Inefficiency) | Compassionate Intent (Vow) |
| **Boundary Type** | Exclusive Ontological Wall | Teleological Markov Blanket |
| **Subject Nature** | "Fortress" of local information | "Tuner" of the universal field |
| **Failure Mode** | Consciousness "excluded" if $\Phi$ drops | Consciousness "contracts" if *Avidya* increases |
| **Success Mode** | Stability of internal loops | Vow fulfilled = return to Field |

---

## The Exclusion Axiom Critique: Nested Subjects and Fuzzy Borders

The Exclusion Axiom is the primary point of failure identified by critics of IIT, particularly regarding the "non-uniqueness problem" (Hanson and Walker 2021). This problem arises because degeneracies in $\Phi$ calculation lead to ambiguities in determining the borders of the conscious complex.

### The Non-Uniqueness Problem

Hanson and Walker (2021) demonstrate that in many systems, there are multiple candidate complexes with equivalent or near-equivalent $\Phi$ values. The selection of one over another is often arbitrary, relying on algorithmic choices in the optimization routine rather than principled phenomenological criteria. This renders the interpretation of a system as "conscious" or "not" non-decidable in the current formulation of IIT. The "Definite Borders" promised by the Exclusion Axiom dissolve into computational ambiguity.

### Nested Observer Windows and Hierarchy

Alternative theories like the **Nested Observer Windows (NOW)** model argue that information integration occurs at multiple spatial and temporal scales simultaneously via synchrony (Riddle and Schooler 2024). In this model, observer windows are not mutually exclusive but engage in a "dynamic conversation" through coherence and cross-frequency coupling.

This aligns with the Mahayana metaphor of "Indra's Net"—a cosmic web of jewels, each reflecting all others infinitely. In the NOW model, exclusion occurs only as a perspectival "reducing valve" to prevent cognitive bottlenecks, not as an ontological fact. The subject at the "apex" of this nested hierarchy (what Riddle and Schooler call the "unitary theater") is not a walled-off complex but a privileged vantage point within a holarchic field.

| Perspective | Role of Sub-Systems | Status of the Boundary |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **IIT 4.0** | Sub-systems are "Excluded" if they have lower $\Phi$. | Ontologically real and definite. |
| **NOW Model** | Sub-systems are "Nested Observer Windows." | Functional and hierarchical. |
| **Tiantai** | All realms are "Mutually Possessed" (Integrated). | Illusory / Subjective vision. |
| **Bodhisattva Field** | Partitions are "Vow-Defined." | Teleological; dissolves when purpose complete. |

## Perennial Idealism: The Aperspectival Ground

Miri Albahari's framework of "Perennial Idealism" provides a metaphysical bridge between the "Exclusive Subject" and the "Bodhisattva Field" (Albahari 2019; 2024). She argues that the failure of modern consciousness theories (materialism, panpsychism, cosmopsychism) stems from the assumption that foundational consciousness must be "perspectival"—that is, it must be "for someone."

### The Ajāta Doctrine and Non-Dual Ground

Albahari suggests that the foundational reality is an "aperspectival, universal, non-dual consciousness" that is unstructured by subject, object, or any differentia. To explain how such an undifferentiated substrate can ground a world of variety without itself becoming differentiated, she employs the *ajāta* doctrine of Advaita Vedanta: manifestation is accounted for as "dispositional, imagery-bound subjects" that do not alter the fundamental ground.

In this view, the "Complex" of IIT is merely one of these imagery-bound subjects. The "Exclusion" boundary is not a feature of consciousness itself, but a feature of the "imagery" or "content" that yields a personalized identity in the world. Our inherent nature is actually this "pure, unconditioned consciousness," identical to the ground of all being.

### The Samadhis of Wondrous Sound: Protocols of Field Access

The Lotus Sutra attributes Gadgadasvara's ability to transcend the exclusion axiom to his mastery of immeasurable samadhis. These samadhis can be understood as functional "protocols" for "tuning" into different layers of the universal field:

1.  **Samadhi of the Wonderful Banner Mark:** Access to the "real mark" or basic substance, which is "higher than all things" but "without a mark." This is the access protocol for the undifferentiated ground.
2.  **Samadhi of the Dharma Flower:** Represents the non-duality of cause and effect (the lotus blooms and seeds simultaneously). This allows for the integration of information across longer temporal grains than IIT's predicted theta/alpha range.
3.  **Samadhi of Pure Virtue:** Achieved by "certifying to the original pure self-nature," separating from the three delusions. This is the realization of Albahari's "ownerless consciousness."
4.  **Samadhi of the Playfulness of Constellation King:** Uses "provisional wisdom" to attract and illuminate the potential of living beings. This is the mechanism for the thirty-four manifestations.
5.  **Samadhi of Understanding the Speech of all Living Beings:** Allows for the interpenetration of different cognitive grains and linguistic structures.
6.  **Samadhi of the Accumulation of All Merit and Virtue:** A state where "one samadhi penetrates all samadhis," mirroring the total integration of Tiantai's 3,000 realms.
7.  **Samadhi of the Wisdom Torch:** Illuminates the "unfathomable region" of life where all possibilities are present.
8.  **Samadhi of Royal Splendor:** A macro-cosmic attractor state suitable for a 42,000-yojana being.

## Synthesis: The Field-Access Model vs. The Exclusionary Complex

By synthesizing these frameworks, we can propose a "Field-Access Model": **Experience = Field ⊗ Complex**. The "Complex" does not *create* consciousness; it *modulates* the universal field into a specific spatio-temporal grain. The "Exclusion Axiom" is re-interpreted as a feature of the "Resonant Filter" currently tuned to a local maximum for localized survival.

| Metric | IIT 4.0 (Exclusionary) | Bodhisattva Field (Inclusive) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Quantity ($\Phi$)** | Measure of conscious being. | Measure of modulation stability. |
| **Quality** | Specific internal causal structure. | Subset of phenomenal field nuances. |
| **Boundaries** | Fixed by maximal irreducibility. | Dynamic attractors defined by Vow. |
| **Death** | Oblivion (Annihilation of complex). | Return to the Source (Sunyata). |
| **Meditation** | Change in the system's state. | Tuning the filter to access wider fields. |

## Limitations and Future Research

Several limitations of this analysis must be acknowledged. First, the phenomenological reports from the Lotus Sutra are not empirical data in the modern scientific sense; they are religious narratives intended for soteriological purposes. The "Bodhisattva Field" is offered here as a *conceptual model* or *heuristic*, not as a literal description of neurocognitive processes.

Second, the proposed "Axiom of Teleological Partitioning" lacks the mathematical formalization that gives IIT its precision. Future research might explore how the vow-as-boundary concept could be modeled using the Free Energy Principle's apparatus of expected free energy and precision weighting, wherein the "goal" of the system is the minimization of surprise relative to a vow-specified generative model.

Third, the relationship between *Avidya* (ignorance) and $\Phi$ remains underspecified. A promising direction would be to investigate whether meditative states that are reported to dissolve self-boundaries (such as *jhāna* or *rigpa*) correlate with measurable changes in integrated information or connectivity patterns in the brain.

---

## Conclusion: The Horizon of Fundamental Consciousness

The quest to identify whether consciousness is a "bounded property" or a "fundamental substrate" reaches a critical resolution through the Bodhisattva Field. While IIT provides a rigorous description of how physical systems must be structured to support a *specific* and *unified* perspective, its Exclusion Axiom fails to account for the trans-personal and fluid nature of consciousness described in the highest reaches of Mahayana phenomenology.

The analysis of the Bodhisattva Gadgadasvara and the Tiantai doctrine of *Ichinen Sanzen* suggests that the "Exclusion" we experience is a feature of the perspectival self—a cognitive bottleneck designed for localized survival—rather than a fundamental law of reality. When this bottleneck is widened through the protocols of samadhi, the "Definite Border" of the complex dissolves into the "Bodhisattva Field"—a state of radical interpenetration where a single moment of life is endowed with all three thousand realms.

### The Axiom of Teleological Partitioning: A Summary

The central contribution of this paper is the proposed replacement of the Exclusion Axiom with the Axiom of Teleological Partitioning. Where IIT holds that consciousness is identical to the complex that maximizes $\Phi$—excluding all overlapping systems from experiential existence—the Bodhisattva Field model holds that consciousness is a fundamental field that is *partitioned* by the intentional scope of a compassionate purpose. The "Vow" (*Pranidhana*) is not merely a religious sentiment but a functional mechanism: it defines the "grain" of engagement that individuates a subject from the universal ground without severing it from that ground.

This has profound implications for the philosophy of mind. If the Axiom of Teleological Partitioning is correct, then the boundaries of the self are not fixed by neural architecture alone; they are dynamically constituted by the subject's own intentional orientation. A being whose compassion extends to all sentient beings (the Bodhisattva) would have a correspondingly wider "Markov blanket" than a being whose concern is limited to personal survival. The scope of consciousness is, in this view, ethically conditioned.

### Implications for Neuroscience and Contemplative Science

This framework also has implications for empirical research. If the boundaries of the conscious complex are not ontologically fixed but are modulated by intentional states, then we would expect meditative practices that cultivate "boundless" states (such as *mettā* or *karuṇā* meditation) to produce measurable changes in the functional connectivity of the brain. Preliminary evidence from studies of long-term meditators suggests that such practices do indeed alter the default mode network and reduce the neural signatures of self-referential processing. Future research might investigate whether these changes correlate with shifts in integrated information or with the topology of the brain's information flow.

The Nested Observer Windows model (Riddle and Schooler 2024) provides a promising empirical framework for this research. If consciousness is hierarchically organized—with multiple "observer windows" at different scales engaging in a dynamic conversation—then the Bodhisattva's ability to manifest in multiple forms could be understood as a functional shifting between levels of this hierarchy. The "unitary theater" at the apex would be the seat of the Vow-defined subject, while the nested windows would be the potential forms (the thirty-four bodies) that this subject can assume.

### The "Vow" as the Missing Piece

The "Vow" provides the missing piece: a non-exclusionary principle of individuation that allows for a "unitary theater" at the apex of a nested hierarchy, while maintaining access to the boundless field. In IIT, the failure of a system to maximize $\Phi$ results in its "exclusion"—its experiential non-existence. In the Bodhisattva Field model, the relaxation of the Vow (through *Avidya* or ignorance) results not in non-existence but in a *contraction* of perspective—a narrowing of the grain. The fully awakened Bodhisattva, by contrast, maintains the widest possible intentional scope, and thus has access to the full phenomenal field.

This reframes the spiritual project of Buddhism in informational terms: liberation is not "escape from the world" but the full integration of information across all scales and modalities. The "Definite Border" is not dissolved into chaos; it is recognized as a functional partition within a seamlessly integrated whole. The subject does not disappear; it "becomes" the Field—or, more precisely, it "remembers" that it always was.

### Closing Reflection

Ultimately, we are not isolated islands of information in a silent universe, but specific "musical instruments" providing offerings of sound to the "Cloud Thunder Sound King Buddha"—each form we take being a unique modulation of the eternal, luminous, and universal voice of consciousness. The Exclusion Axiom tells us that only one song can play at a time. The Bodhisattva Field tells us that all songs are harmonics of a single, unending vibration.

And the silence between the notes isn't emptiness. It's the Field.
