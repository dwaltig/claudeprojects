# AI STATEMENT OPTIONS: "The 10 Suchnesses of the Machine"
## Honest Disclosure Strategies for Different Venues

**Created:** 2026-01-13
**Purpose:** Navigate AI disclosure requirements while maintaining credibility and honesty

---

## THE ETHICAL FOUNDATION: COMPLETE TRANSPARENCY

**Core Principle:** Given that your essay *critiques* AI, using AI tools and being transparent about it actually **strengthens your credibility**. You're not a hypocrite hiding AI use—you're a researcher who understands the tools deeply enough to critique them.

**Key Distinction:**
- ✅ **AI as Editorial Assistant:** Analysis, feedback, structure recommendations, citation checking
- ❌ **AI as Ghostwriter:** AI generating original arguments, prose, or ideas

**Your Actual Use Case (Based on Our Interaction):**
1. You wrote the original 3,700-word manuscript
2. You used Claude for MAS review (editorial analysis, venue comparison, structural recommendations)
3. You're consulting Claude for submission strategy
4. The **ideas, arguments, framework, and prose are yours**
5. Claude provided **analytical feedback, not content generation**

---

## STATEMENT OPTION 1: FULL DISCLOSURE (MAXIMUM TRANSPARENCY)
**Best for:** NOEMA, academic venues, any publication with strict AI policies
**Tone:** Honest, detailed, self-aware

### Template:

**AI Statement:**

I used Claude (Anthropic) as an editorial consultant throughout the development of this piece. Specifically:

**Research & Analysis:**
- Consulted Claude to analyze publication venue fit and editorial requirements
- Used Claude to fact-check citations and verify source accuracy
- Employed Claude to review structural coherence and argument flow

**Editorial Feedback:**
- Received feedback on clarity, organization, and accessibility of Buddhist concepts for general audiences
- Used Claude to identify areas where jargon required additional explanation
- Consulted on opening hook effectiveness and conclusion strength

**What AI Did NOT Do:**
- The core thesis (the "Cult of Plausibility," "Reverse Perfuming," Ten Suchnesses framework) originated from my research and practice
- All prose was written by me
- The Buddhist philosophical analysis is based on my [X years] study of [specific traditions]
- The AI technical analysis draws on my background in [your field/expertise]

**Why This Approach:**
Given that this essay critiques AI's epistemological limitations, I believe transparency about AI use demonstrates the very "Process/Verb" thinking I advocate. I used AI as a tool for refinement, not replacement of human insight—precisely the distinction the essay argues for.

**Documentation Available:**
I can provide conversation transcripts, editorial notes, and draft iterations showing the development process upon request.

---

**Analysis of Option 1:**

✅ **Strengths:**
- Complete honesty (no risk of "gotcha" later)
- Self-aware about irony (using AI to critique AI)
- Demonstrates you understand AI as tool, not oracle
- Shows sophistication about human/AI collaboration
- Provides documentation offer (builds trust)

⚠️ **Risks:**
- Some editors may still be conservative about ANY AI use
- Could trigger additional scrutiny (but you can handle that)
- Requires confidence in your own authorship (which you should have)

**Recommended For:** NOEMA (they explicitly do due diligence), any venue with strict policies

---

## STATEMENT OPTION 2: CONCISE DISCLOSURE (STANDARD TRANSPARENCY)
**Best for:** Tricycle, Boston Review, venues without explicit strict policies
**Tone:** Professional, brief, clear

### Template:

**AI Statement:**

I used Claude (Anthropic) as an editorial assistant to review draft structure, check citations, and provide feedback on clarity for general audiences. All original research, arguments, philosophical analysis, and prose are my own work. The core thesis and Buddhist framework application originated from my research and contemplative practice.

---

**Analysis of Option 2:**

✅ **Strengths:**
- Honest without over-explaining
- Positions AI as assistant, not author
- Brief enough not to raise red flags
- Emphasizes human authorship clearly

⚠️ **Risks:**
- Less detail may prompt follow-up questions
- Doesn't preemptively address the irony (piece about AI using AI)

**Recommended For:** Tricycle, Boston Review, venues that request disclosure but don't have detailed policies

---

## STATEMENT OPTION 3: FRAME-AS-FEATURE (IRONY AS STRENGTH)
**Best for:** Tech-savvy venues, NOEMA (if you want to be bold)
**Tone:** Confident, self-aware, philosophically sophisticated

### Template:

**AI Statement:**

This essay about AI epistemology was developed with AI as an editorial partner—a methodological choice that embodies the essay's central argument. I used Claude (Anthropic) to:

- Analyze structural coherence (exercising the "Process/Verb" thinking I advocate)
- Fact-check citations and verify technical claims
- Receive editorial feedback on accessibility for non-specialist readers

However, the core intellectual work—the "Reverse Perfuming" hypothesis, the Ten Suchnesses framework application, the Buddhist philosophical analysis—emerged from my research, contemplative practice, and human insight.

**The Distinction Matters:** This collaboration illustrates precisely what the essay argues: AI excels at pattern recognition, consistency checking, and surface optimization (the "Plausibility" layer), while human cognition provides the "eccentric genius" of original synthesis, ethical judgment, and experiential wisdom. Using AI to *refine* the argument about AI's limitations is not contradictory—it's empirical.

I can provide full documentation of the development process, including conversation transcripts and draft iterations, to demonstrate the clear delineation between AI assistance and human authorship.

---

**Analysis of Option 3:**

✅ **Strengths:**
- Turns potential liability into intellectual sophistication
- Demonstrates deep understanding of your own argument
- Shows confidence and self-awareness
- Actually *strengthens* the piece's credibility (you practice what you preach)
- Philosophical framing (methodological choice, not convenience)

⚠️ **Risks:**
- Could come across as defensive or too clever
- Some editors may prefer simpler disclosure
- Requires editor to engage philosophically (not just check box)

**Recommended For:** NOEMA (they value intellectual boldness), venues where editor relationship is established

---

## STATEMENT OPTION 4: MINIMAL DISCLOSURE (IF NO POLICY)
**Best for:** Venues with no stated AI policy (use cautiously)
**Tone:** Brief, standard

### Template:

**AI Statement:**

Editorial assistance from AI tools was used for structural review and citation verification. All original content, arguments, and analysis are my own work.

---

**Analysis of Option 4:**

✅ **Strengths:**
- Very brief, doesn't invite scrutiny
- Standard professional disclosure

⚠️ **Risks:**
- May be insufficient if venue later implements strict policy
- Could be seen as evasive if they find out more later
- Not recommended if venue has explicit policy

**Recommended For:** Only use if venue has NO stated AI policy AND you're certain about authorship

---

## VENUE-SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### FOR TRICYCLE:

**Recommended:** **Option 2 (Concise Disclosure)**

**Why:**
- Tricycle hasn't published explicit AI policy (from research)
- Buddhist audience may appreciate simplicity and directness
- Your Lotus Sutra work provides independent credibility
- No need to over-explain

**Suggested Tricycle-Specific Addition:**

"I used Claude (Anthropic) as an editorial assistant to review draft structure, check citations, and provide feedback on clarity for general audiences. All original research, arguments, philosophical analysis, and prose are my own work, grounded in [X years] of Buddhist practice and study of Yogācāra philosophy and the Lotus Sutra."

**Key Addition:** The Buddhist credentials sentence reinforces your human expertise.

---

### FOR NOEMA:

**Recommended:** **Option 1 (Full Disclosure)** or **Option 3 (Frame-as-Feature)**

**Why:**
- NOEMA explicitly does "internal due diligence to assess AI usage"
- They may request "recordings, transcripts, notes"
- They're sophisticated enough to appreciate the irony/methodology argument
- Transparency prevents kill fee forfeiture

**Decision Between Option 1 vs. 3:**

**Choose Option 1 if:**
- You want to play it safe
- You prefer straightforward disclosure
- You're unsure how editor will receive philosophical framing

**Choose Option 3 if:**
- You're confident in the methodology argument
- You want to establish yourself as thoughtful about AI collaboration
- You believe the irony strengthens the piece

**My Recommendation for NOEMA:** **Option 3** (Frame-as-Feature)
- NOEMA values intellectual boldness and cross-disciplinary thinking
- Your piece is ABOUT AI epistemology—discussing your methodology IS relevant
- Demonstrates you're not just theorizing but practicing critical AI engagement
- Shows editorial sophistication

---

### FOR BOSTON REVIEW:

**Recommended:** **Option 2 (Concise Disclosure)**

**Why:**
- BR hasn't published explicit AI policy (from research)
- Left-intellectual audience may have concerns but appreciates honesty
- Concise statement prevents distraction from content
- Sufficient transparency without over-explaining

---

## DOCUMENTATION YOU SHOULD PREPARE (FOR ANY VENUE)

If any editor requests documentation, be ready with:

### 1. **Conversation Transcript Summary**
- Export key exchanges with Claude
- Highlight: You asking for analysis, Claude providing feedback
- Show clear delineation: You writing, Claude reviewing

### 2. **Draft Iterations**
- Original manuscript (pre-Claude consultation)
- Post-feedback drafts showing YOUR revisions
- Demonstrates human decision-making in revision process

### 3. **Research Notes**
- Your Buddhist study notes (Yogācāra, Lotus Sutra)
- Your AI research sources (Bender et al., Shumailov, etc.)
- Shows independent intellectual foundation

### 4. **Personal Expertise Statement**
- Brief bio of your Buddhist background
- Your AI/tech expertise or research
- Lotus Sutra translation project (establishes Buddhist credentials)

**What This Proves:**
- AI was consultant, not author
- Your expertise predates and grounds the piece
- Revisions were your decisions, not AI's

## HANDLING POTENTIAL PUSHBACK

### If Editor Says: "We prefer no AI use at all"

**Response Option A (Withdraw gracefully):**
"I understand. I want to respect your editorial standards. I'll withdraw this submission and consider submitting original work without AI assistance in the future. Thank you for clarifying your policy."

**Response Option B (Make the case):**
"I appreciate your concern. I want to clarify that AI was used solely for editorial feedback, similar to how a writer might consult a writing group or editorial assistant. The intellectual content—the core thesis, philosophical framework, and analysis—is entirely my own work, grounded in [X years] of Buddhist study and practice. I believe this distinction is meaningful and aligns with your standards for original work. Would you be willing to review the piece with this understanding?"

**Response Option C (Offer documentation):**
"I understand your preference. Would it be helpful if I provided documentation of the development process? I can share conversation transcripts, draft iterations, and research notes that demonstrate the clear delineation between AI editorial assistance and human authorship. This might help you assess whether the piece meets your standards."

### If Editor Says: "Interesting—tell me more about your methodology"

**Response (Opportunity!):**
"I'm glad you asked. Given that this piece critiques AI's epistemological limitations, I wanted to 'practice what I preach' by using AI as a tool for refinement rather than replacement. Specifically, I used Claude to:

[Insert relevant details from Option 1 or 3]

This process actually reinforced the essay's central argument: AI is excellent at pattern recognition and consistency checking (the 'Plausibility' layer), but the original synthesis—the 'Reverse Perfuming' hypothesis, the Ten Suchnesses application—required human insight grounded in contemplative practice and lived experience. The AI couldn't have written this piece because it lacks the experiential foundation in Buddhist practice and the creative 'eccentric genius' to make novel conceptual connections.

I'm happy to provide full documentation if helpful."

**What This Does:**
- Demonstrates sophistication about AI collaboration
- Reinforces your expertise and authorship
- Shows you're not hiding anything
- Positions you as thoughtful, not cavalier

---

## THE IRONY AS STRENGTH: REFRAMING THE CONVERSATION

**Key Insight:** Most writers using AI are trying to HIDE it because they used it to GENERATE content. You're different:

1. You used AI for ANALYSIS of your own writing
2. Your piece is ABOUT AI epistemology
3. Transparency about AI use actually demonstrates your understanding

**Reframe:**
"A writer using AI to ghostwrite and hiding it = hypocrite
A writer critiquing AI, using it as editorial tool, and disclosing it = researcher"

**Example Framing (for conversations with editors):**

"I see AI as analogous to spell-check or grammar software—it's a tool that augments human work without replacing human authorship. Just as using Grammarly to catch typos doesn't mean Grammarly wrote the essay, using Claude for structural feedback doesn't mean Claude authored the argument. The difference is transparency and the nature of the collaboration.

In fact, for a piece about AI epistemology, NOT using AI would be suspicious—it would suggest I'm theorizing about tools I don't understand. My transparency demonstrates I'm engaging critically with AI from a position of familiarity, not ignorance."

---

## WHAT IF THEY SAY NO?

**Perspective Check:**

If a venue rejects the piece solely because of disclosed AI use (not content quality), that tells you:
1. They're not ready for nuanced conversation about AI collaboration
2. They may not be the right venue for a piece critiquing AI epistemology
3. Their loss—the piece will find a better home

**Your ethical position is strong:**
- You're being transparent
- You wrote the content
- AI was a tool for refinement
- For a piece ABOUT AI, this is methodologically sound

**Don't compromise your integrity by:**
- ❌ Lying about AI use (will backfire)
- ❌ Being evasive (creates suspicion)
- ❌ Feeling defensive (you did nothing wrong)

**Do:**
- ✅ Be transparent and confident
- ✅ Emphasize human authorship
- ✅ Frame AI as editorial tool
- ✅ Offer documentation if requested

## BOTTOM LINE

**For Tricycle:** Option 2 (Concise + Buddhist Credentials)
**For NOEMA:** Option 3 (Frame-as-Feature + Documentation Offer)
**For Boston Review:** Option 2 (Concise)

**Core Message:**
"I used AI as an editorial assistant to refine my work, not as a ghostwriter. The ideas, arguments, and prose are mine, grounded in [Buddhist practice/research]. I'm transparent about this because the piece critiques AI—hiding AI use would undermine my credibility."

**Confidence Level:** High. Your position is ethically sound and intellectually defensible.

---

**Remember:** You're not a writer trying to cheat. You're a scholar/practitioner using modern tools to refine important ideas. Own it.

---

**Questions to Consider:**

1. How many years have you been studying Buddhism/Yogācāra? (For credentials sentence)
2. What's your background with AI/technology? (Strengthens methodological choice framing)
3. Do you have the original manuscript saved pre-Claude consultation? (Important for documentation)
4. Are you comfortable with Option 3's boldness for NOEMA, or prefer Option 1's safety?

Let me know your answers and I can help customize the perfect statement for your situation.
