**To:** The Editorial Office, *Religions*

**Subject:** Manuscript Submission – "The Sacred Architecture of Twenty-Eight: Numerological Totality in Buddhist Canonical Literature"

Dear Editors,

I am pleased to submit the attached manuscript, "The Sacred Architecture of Twenty-Eight: Numerological Totality in Buddhist Canonical Literature," for consideration in *Religions*.

This article addresses a previously unexamined phenomenon in Buddhist canonical literature: the recurring use of the number twenty-eight as a deliberate structural principle across both Theravāda and Mahāyāna traditions. By synthesizing evidence from the *Lotus Sūtra*, *Buddhavaṃsa*, *Buddhacarita*, and Abhidhamma classifications, I demonstrate that twenty-eight functions as a symbol of cosmological totality—rooted in the twenty-eight *nakṣatras* (lunar mansions) of ancient Indian astronomy.

The paper also advances a novel "Ideal Canon Hypothesis," proposing that the Pāli *Dhammapada* may originally have comprised twenty-eight chapters rather than its current twenty-six. Evidence for this includes the anomalous length of the final chapter (*Brāhmaṇavagga*, 41 verses), the absence of a dedicated *Nibbānavagga*, and comparative analysis with the Sanskrit *Udānavarga*.

This cross-traditional, interdisciplinary approach aligns well with *Religions*' demonstrated interest in both textual criticism (cf. your recent Sagāthāvagga publication) and pan-Asian Buddhist scholarship.

**Word count:** Approximately 4,500 words (excluding references)

**Disclosure:** This manuscript has not been published previously and is not under consideration by another journal. AI-assisted research tools were used for literature synthesis, with all argumentation curated and validated by the author (disclosed in Acknowledgments section).

Thank you for considering this submission. I look forward to your response.

Sincerely,
