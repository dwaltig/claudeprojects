**Re:** Manuscript Submission — "Orchestrating AI Ensembles for Sacred Text Translation: A Multi-Model Methodology for Buddhist Sutra Scholarship"

---

Dear Editors,

I am pleased to submit the attached manuscript, "Orchestrating AI Ensembles for Sacred Text Translation," for consideration as a full article in *Digital Scholarship in the Humanities*.

**Summary:** This paper presents a novel methodology for leveraging multiple large language models (LLMs) in a coordinated workflow for Buddhist sutra translation. Drawing from a case study of the Lotus Sutra—a complete 28-chapter translation comprising both a scholarly edition with over 1,500 footnotes and a parallel vernacular "blues gospel" interpretation—I demonstrate how different AI models can be orchestrated to complement each other's strengths.

**Contribution to Digital Humanities:** The methodology provides DH practitioners with a systematic approach to AI-assisted translation that maintains scholarly rigor through multi-model verification, offering an alternative to both uncritical AI adoption and wholesale AI rejection. The paper documents the first comprehensive case study of multi-model AI orchestration applied to sacred text translation.

**AI Disclosure:** As detailed in the manuscript, this project employed multiple AI systems (Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, GPT-4) in the workflow I describe. All AI-generated content was reviewed, verified, and approved by me. I maintain full responsibility for the accuracy and integrity of the work.

**Manuscript Details:**
- Word count: ~8,965 (excluding references and appendix)
- No prior publication or concurrent submission elsewhere
- No conflicts of interest to declare

I believe this work will be of significant interest to DSH readers working at the intersection of AI, translation studies, and digital humanities methodology.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
