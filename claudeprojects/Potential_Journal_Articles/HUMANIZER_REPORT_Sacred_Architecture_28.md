## Strengths

### 1. Memorable Opening
> "Twenty-eight. The number appears too often to be coincidence."

**Rating**: ✅ Excellent hook — punchy, direct, intriguing.

### 2. Quotable One-Liner
> "Samsara has a chapter. Nirvana does not."

**Rating**: ✅ This will be cited. Memorable and encapsulates the thesis.

### 3. Technical Depth Without Jargon
The muhūrtas breakdown and 13°20′ division are technical but presented accessibly. No gatekeeping.

### 4. Natural Academic Voice
The paper reads like a genuine scholar wrote it, not like AI-generated fluff. Tables, verse numbers, and concrete examples ground the argument.

---

## Remaining Issues (Minor)

### Issue 1: Section 1 Missing

The paper jumps from the hook directly to "## 2. The Astronomical Foundation". This creates a formatting gap.

**Fix**: Add "## 1. Introduction" after line 17:

```markdown
## 1. Introduction

Twenty-eight. The number appears too often...
```

### Issue 2: Conclusion Could Be Stronger

Current ending:
> "...providing practitioners with a structured path to liberation inscribed in the very architecture of the scriptures they study."

**Alternative** (optional): Add a final punchy line:
> "The moon completes its cycle in twenty-eight stations. So, perhaps, does the Dharma."

---

## Voice Consistency Check

The paper maintains a consistent scholarly register. The author's perspective (independent scholar, interdisciplinary lens) comes through naturally.

**No red flags for peer review.**

---

## Final Verdict

**APPROVED FOR SUBMISSION**

Apply Section 1 header fix. Optional: add closing one-liner.
