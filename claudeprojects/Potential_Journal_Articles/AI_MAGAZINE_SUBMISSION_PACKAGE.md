## Cover Letter for AI Magazine

**To**: Coeditors, AI Magazine  
**Email**: aimag-ed@aaai.org  
**Date**: December 20, 2025

**Re**: Submission of "The Architecture of Agentic Intelligence: Specialization, Coordination, and the Digital Division of Labor"

Dear Coeditors,

I am pleased to submit the enclosed manuscript for consideration in AI Magazine.

**Article Type**: Survey/Tutorial Article

**Summary**: This article provides a comprehensive survey of multi-agent AI architectures through the lens of Adam Smith's economic theory of the division of labor. It synthesizes empirical evidence across five domains—software engineering, scientific discovery, medicine, finance, and enterprise workflows—demonstrating that coordinated specialist agents consistently outperform monolithic models by factors of 3-13x on complex tasks.

**Relevance to AI Magazine Readership**:
- Bridges economic theory with practical AI architecture design
- Provides actionable guidance for practitioners building agentic systems
- Synthesizes the latest research (2023-2025) on multi-agent coordination
- Identifies concrete failure modes and design constraints (MAST taxonomy, three-agent constraint)

**Technical Accessibility**: The article is written for a broad AI audience, minimizing jargon while maintaining technical precision. All specialized terms are defined on first use.

**AI Tool Disclosure**: [DISCLOSE ANY AI TOOLS USED IN WRITING/RESEARCH]

**Word Count**: ~7,500 words  
**References**: 66

This manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by another journal.

Thank you for considering this work.

Sincerely,
