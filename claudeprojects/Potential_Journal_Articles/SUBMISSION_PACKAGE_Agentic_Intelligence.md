Dear Editor,

I am pleased to submit the enclosed manuscript, "The Architecture of Agentic Intelligence: Specialization, Coordination, and the Digital Division of Labor," for consideration in [JOURNAL NAME].

**Summary**: This survey article examines the architectural principles underlying multi-agent AI systems through the lens of Adam Smith's economic theory of the division of labor. The manuscript synthesizes empirical evidence across five domains—software engineering, scientific discovery, medicine, finance, and enterprise workflows—demonstrating that coordinated specialist agents consistently outperform monolithic models by factors of 3-13x on complex tasks.

**Key Contributions**:
1. First systematic connection between classical economic theory and modern MAS architecture
2. Multi-domain empirical evidence table (MAGIS, Coated-LLM, MDAT, TradingAgents, AgentReport)
3. Analysis of coordination constraints including the "three-agent constraint" and Inverted-U relationship
4. Integration of the MAST failure taxonomy identifying 14 unique failure modes
5. Introduction of MTTR-A as a reliability metric for agentic systems

**Timeliness**: With enterprise adoption of agentic AI accelerating in 2025, this survey provides practitioners and researchers with both theoretical grounding and practical design principles.

**Word Count**: Approximately 7,500 words
**References**: 66

This manuscript has not been published elsewhere and is not under consideration by another journal. All authors have approved the manuscript and agree with its submission.

Thank you for considering this work for publication.

Sincerely,
