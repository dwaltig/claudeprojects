## Cover Letter for JAIR

---

**To**: Editor-in-Chief, Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research

**From**: [Author Name]

**Subject**: Survey Article Submission — "The Architecture of Collective Intelligence: Multi-Agent Systems in Theory and Practice (2023-2025)"

Dear Editor,

I am pleased to submit the enclosed survey article, "The Architecture of Collective Intelligence: Multi-Agent Systems in Theory and Practice (2023-2025)," for consideration in the Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research.

### Summary

This comprehensive survey addresses the paradigm shift from monolithic large language models to coordinated multi-agent systems. The manuscript synthesizes theoretical foundations with empirical evidence across five critical domains—software engineering, scientific discovery, medical diagnostics, financial analysis, and enterprise workflows—synthesizing evidence that multi-agent systems frequently outperform monolithic baselines—often by multi-fold margins—on complex, long-horizon tasks.

### Contributions

1. **Theoretical Synthesis**: A unified framework connecting individual agent design with multi-agent coordination patterns, grounded in Adam Smith's economic theory of the division of labor.

2. **Empirical Validation**: Quantitative evidence from 15+ evaluation studies showing consistent MAS superiority, including 8.2x improvement in GitHub issue resolution (MAGIS), 13x in financial trading returns (TradingAgents), and +203% in biomedical hypothesis accuracy (Coated-LLM).

3. **Actionable Principles**: Five implementation principles that practitioners can apply immediately when designing agentic systems.

### Suitability for JAIR

JAIR has a distinguished history of publishing foundational AI surveys. This manuscript contributes to that tradition by:
- Synthesizing a rapidly evolving field (2023-2025 literature)
- Providing both theoretical grounding and empirical validation
- Offering actionable guidance for practitioners
- Specifying explicit defeat conditions for epistemic rigor (Section 11.4)

### Reproducibility

The reproducibility checklist is included as required. 

As a survey article, this manuscript reports no new experimental results. Reproducibility is supported through complete citation of all empirical studies discussed, including benchmark names, evaluation metrics, and reported baselines, enabling independent verification via the original sources.

### Declaration

I confirm that:
- This manuscript has not been published elsewhere
- This manuscript is not under review at another journal
- I grant JAIR the right to publish under CC BY license if accepted

Thank you for considering this submission.

Respectfully,

## Next Steps for JAIR Submission

### 1. Download JAIR LaTeX Template
- **Author Kit**: https://www.jair.org/public/jair-author-kit.zip
- **Overleaf Template**: Available in Overleaf gallery

### 2. Convert Manuscript to LaTeX
The current markdown manuscript must be converted to JAIR's LaTeX format:
```
\documentclass{jair}
\begin{document}
...
\end{document}
```

### 3. Complete Reproducibility Checklist
The checklist is at the end of the JAIR LaTeX template. For surveys:
- Check "N/A" for experimental sections
- Describe how empirical claims can be verified via cited sources

### 4. Generate PDF and Submit
- Compile LaTeX to PDF
- Submit at https://www.jair.org/index.php/jair/about/submissions

## arXiv Considerations

> ⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: As of November 2025, arXiv requires prior peer review for survey/review papers in cs.AI.

### Options for arXiv:

1. **Submit to JAIR first** → After acceptance, post to arXiv with proof of peer review
2. **Reclassify as original research** → If paper can be framed as original contribution (not survey), peer review requirement may not apply
3. **Post as cs.LG or cs.MA** → Different subcategories may have different policies

### Recommended Strategy:

1. Submit to JAIR (no peer review required for initial submission)
2. Upon JAIR acceptance, post to arXiv with DOI as proof of peer review
3. This satisfies arXiv's new November 2025 policy
