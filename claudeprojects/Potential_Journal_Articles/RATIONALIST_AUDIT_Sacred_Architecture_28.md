## Overall Assessment

**Epistemic Status**: STRONG
**Recommendation**: READY FOR SUBMISSION

---

## Changes Since v1

| Addition | Impact on Epistemics |
|----------|---------------------|
| Nakṣatra mathematics (muhūrtas) | ✅ Strengthens astronomical foundation |
| 27 vs 28 shift explanation | ✅ Addresses why 28 persisted despite 27 being mathematically cleaner |
| Brough's decreasing length principle | ✅ Adds concrete philological evidence |
| Chapter 14 gap (1.5" space) | ✅ Physical manuscript evidence |
| "Core 26" thesis | ✅ Establishes baseline for 28 hypothesis |
| Fa-chu ching (26+13=39) | ✅ Corroborates Core 26 |

---

## Strengths (Improved)

### 1. Falsifiable Hypothesis
The paper now has:
- Clear defeat conditions (Section 7.5) ✅
- Alternative explanations acknowledged (Section 7.6) ✅
- Specific verse numbers for proposed Nibbānavagga (383–386, 410–423) ✅

### 2. Evidence Quality (Enhanced)
- Brough's Chapter 14 gap is **physical evidence**, not just interpretation
- Muhūrtas breakdown shows deep engagement with primary sources
- 108 padas connection demonstrates broader numerological literacy

### 3. Novel Contribution
- "Core 26 → 28" hypothesis is now explicitly framed
- No prior scholarship claims this connection (confirmed by NotebookLM)

---

## Remaining Issues (Minor)

### Issue 1: Citation Precision

**Status**: Still needs page numbers for some claims.

**Recommendation**: Before submission, add:
- Brough page numbers for Chapter 14 gap and decreasing length
- Zhiyi citation from *Mohe Zhiguan* or secondary source

### Issue 2: Section Numbering

**Observation**: Section 1 is missing (jumps from hook to Section 2).

**Recommendation**: Add "## 1. Introduction" after the opening hook for formal consistency.

## Word Hygiene Check

| Term | Count | Status |
|------|-------|--------|
| "suggests" | 6 | ✅ Appropriate |
| "may have" | 3 | ✅ Appropriate |
| "proves" | 0 | ✅ Avoided |
| "clearly" | 0 | ✅ Clean |
| "delve" | 0 | ✅ Clean |

---

## Bayesian Update

**Prior probability** (after v1): 25%
**Posterior probability** (after v2): 35%

**Reasoning**: The Brough physical evidence (Chapter 14 gap) and Core 26 thesis provide concrete anchors. The 27→28 mathematical explanation shows the 28 count was *deliberate*, not a recording error.

## Final Verdict

**APPROVED FOR SUBMISSION**

Minor fixes (Section 1 header, citation page numbers) can be addressed during copy-editing. The epistemic structure is sound.
