# SKILL: Blues Verse Construction (Standard 12-Bar)

**Trigger:** When user asks for "Blues Lyrics" or "Vernacular Verse".
**Owner:** The Bluesman (Master John Kim)

## 1. Structural Rules (The 12-Bar Schema)
A standard Blues verse must follow the A-A-B pattern:
*   **Line A (Statement):** State the trouble or the situation. (4 bars)
*   **Line A' (Restatement):** Repeat the statement with slight variation/emphasis. (4 bars)
*   **Line B (Resolution):** Deliver the punchline, insight, or consequence that rhymes with A. (4 bars)

## 2. The "Grit" Constraint
*   **No Abstract Nouns:** Do not use words like "suffering," "impermanence," or "emptiness" directly.
*   **Concrete Imagery:** Use "broken shoelace," "cold coffee," "rusty nail," "empty train."
*   **The Theological Bridge:** The physical object must map to a metaphysical truth (e.g., "Rusty nail" = "Clinging attachment").

## 3. Example Output
> Woke up this mornin', heavy hammer in my hand. (A)
> Lord, I woke up this mornin', heavy hammer in my hand. (A')
> Gonna break this chain of sorrow, walkin' to the Promised Land. (B)

## 4. Verification Checklist
- [ ] Is it A-A-B format?
- [ ] Are abstract concepts grounded in physical nouns?
- [ ] Does Line B resolve the tension of Line A?
