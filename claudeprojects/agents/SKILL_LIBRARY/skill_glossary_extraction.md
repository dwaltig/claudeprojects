# SKILL: Glossary Definition Extraction

**Trigger:** When creating/updating a Hybrid Glossary.
**Owner:** The Professor / The Bluesman

## 1. Extraction Protocol
When defining a term, you must produce TWO distinct definitions:

### A. Scholarly Definition (The "Head")
*   **Source:** Philological precision (Sanskrit/Pali/Chinese).
*   **Focus:** Etymology and doctrinal context.
*   **Tone:** Academic, neutral, precise.

### B. Blues Vernacular Definition (The "Heart")
*   **Source:** Lived experience, musical metaphor.
*   **Focus:** Emotional resonance and "street" application.
*   **Tone:** Raw, visceral, "The Why."

## 2. Formatting Schema
```markdown
### **[Term] ([Original Script] - [Translation])**
*   **Scholarly Definition**: [Definition A]
*   **Blues Vernacular**: **"[Metaphor 1]" / "[Metaphor 2]"**
*   **The "Why"**: [Explanation of the bridge between A and B]
```
