Enforcement

Enforcement of this Policy is at our sole discretion, and any failure by us to enforce this Policy in every instance does not constitute a waiver of our right to enforce it in other instances.

We use a combination of automated systems, user reports, and human review to assess material and usage that may violate this Policy. For users who violate this Policy, we may remove the violating material, and/or suspend your access to and use of our Generative AI Services. For certain material that poses a real-world risk of harm, we reserve the right to contact or cooperate with relevant law enforcement authorities.
