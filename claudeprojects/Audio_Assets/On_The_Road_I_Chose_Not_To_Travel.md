### Lyrics

**[Intro - Spoken/Hummed]**  
Hmm... aaah...

---

**[Verse 1]**  
I had to be me  
True to myself, you see  
Too proud to take that avenue  

I created my own world  
Now I have to live in it  
Live with it  
Didn't become the big wow  
Didn't die young and beautiful somehow  

---

**[Chorus]**  
It's just a case of the shouldas  
Watching people pass me by  
On the roads I chose not to travel  

---

**[Verse 2]**  
Too above it all  
Forever young only in my mind  
After a lifetime of drunken nights  
Had to face the blinding dawn  

Just the soul's hangover  
Never got a do-over  
While the body got old  

---

**[Bridge - Tender, with brass swells]**  
Oh... oh... *(sigh)*  

There's the tab to pay  
And I can't stay  
Tossed out in the darkness  
To face an irrelevant world  
Or maybe just an irrelevant me  

---

**[Chorus]**  
It's just a case of the shouldas  
Watching people pass me by  
On the roads I chose not to travel  

---

**[Verse 3]**  
Good times, bad choices  
Distant voices that used to matter  
Now just echoes scattered  

---

**[Outro - Intimate, guitar and strings only]**  
Sheltered in calloused indifference  
Too late to change the road I'm on  
But I walked it...  
I walked it on my own  

*(Instrumental fade: nylon guitar, soft congas, single muted trumpet)*

Empty glass on the worn wooden table.

On The Road I Chose Not To Travel
The William Altig Choir

A romantic melancholy bolero about the roads we didn't take and the people who passed us by while we sat at our own window, watching.

"It's just a case of the shouldas
Watching people pass me by
On the roads I chose not to travel"

This song is for everyone who ever chose their own path—and lived with it. For those who didn't become the "big wow," didn't die young, and had to face the blinding dawn with nothing but the soul's hangover and hard-won dignity.

LYRICS:

I had to be me
True to myself, you see
Too proud to take that avenue

I created my own world
Now I have to live in it
Live with it
Didn't become the big wow
Didn't die young and beautiful somehow

It's just a case of the shouldas
Watching people pass me by
On the roads I chose not to travel

Too above it all
Forever young only in my mind
After a lifetime of drunken nights
Had to face the blinding dawn

Just the soul's hangover
Never got a do-over
While the body got old

There's the tab to pay
And I can't stay
Tossed out in the darkness
To face an irrelevant world
Or maybe just an irrelevant me

Good times, bad choices
Distant voices that used to matter
Now just echoes scattered

Sheltered in calloused indifference
Too late to change the road I'm on
But I walked it...
I walked it on my own
