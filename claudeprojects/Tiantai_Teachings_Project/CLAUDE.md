# CLAUDE.md - Tiantai Teachings Project

## 1. Project Overview

The **Tiantai Teachings Project** is a dedicated effort to translate and interpret the foundational commentaries of the Tiantai Buddhist tradition, specifically the major works of **Master Zhiyi** (538–597 CE). This project complements the Lotus Sutra translation by providing the philosophical and practical framework necessary to understand its deepest meaning.

**Primary Texts:**
1.  **The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra** (*Fáhhuá Xuányì* 法華玄義) - T.1716
    *   Focus: Doctrinal classification, the "Five Periods and Eight Teachings," and the "Ten Suchnesses."
2.  **Great Cessation and Contemplation** (*Móhē Zhǐguān* 摩訶止觀) - T.1911
    *   Focus: Systematic meditation, the "Threefold Truth," and practical application.
3.  **The Words and Phrases of the Lotus Sutra** (*Fáhuá Wénjù* 法華文句) - T.1718
    *   Focus: Line-by-line textual commentary, the "Source Code" of the Sutra, grounding theory in the canon.

**Key Components:**
*   **Source Text:** Classical Chinese (Taishō Tripiṭaka editions)
*   **Dual Translation:** Scholarly (Rigorous Philosophical) + Practitioner (Actionable/Blues)
*   **Agent System:** The Architect (Structure/Doctrine) + The Practitioner (Meditation/Life)

## 2. Critical Safety Protocol

**READ BEFORE EDITING:**
*   **Preserve Doctrinal Integrity:** Tiantai philosophy is extremely precise. Terms like "Three Thousand Realms in a Single Moment of Thought" (一念三千) must be handled with exactitude.
*   **Verify Encodings:** Ensure UTF-8 is used. Preserve Pinyin and/or Wade-Giles romanization as per project standard, alongside correct Sanskrit reconstruction where applicable.
*   **Contextual Accuracy:** Always distinguish between the "Trace Gate" (historical teaching) and the "Fundamental Gate" (ultimate teaching) of the Lotus Sutra.

## 4. Specialized Agents (MAS)

### The Architect (Master Zhiyi Persona)
**Role:** Structural & Doctrinal Translation
*   Analyzes the "Five Sections" (Name, Substance, Essence, Function, Teaching).
*   Ensures rigorous consistency with Tiantai taxonomy (5 Periods, 8 Teachings).
*   Provides extensive footnotes on doctrinal categorization.

### The Practitioner (Meditation Guide / Bluesman)
**Role:** Practical Application & Vernacular Reach
*   Translates "theory" into "practice" (How do I sit with this?).
*   Uses the Blues idiom to ground high philosophy in lived suffering and liberation.
*   Ensures the text functions as a *manual*, not just a museum piece.

### The Road Manager (Audit / QA)
**Role:** Doctrinal Integrity & "Code Wiki" Enforcement
*   Audits translations against the CBETA source.
*   Ensures the "Threefold Truth" is preserved in vernacular.
*   Rejects "spiritual fluff" or inaccuracy.

## 5. Translation Workflow

1.  **Source Analysis:** The Architect analyzes the Classical Chinese source (T.1716, T.1911, or T.1718).
2.  **Scholarly Draft:** The Architect produces a rigorously annotated English translation, preserving technical Tiantai terms.
3.  **Practitioner Review:** The Practitioner reviews the draft for "meditative viability"—can this be practiced?
4.  **Vernacular/Blues Version:** The Practitioner creates a version that speaks to the heart and the cushion (or the front porch).
5.  **Road Manager Audit:** The Road Manager verifies doctrinal accuracy, structural integrity, and proper term usage.
6.  **Consolidation:** Both versions are combined, with the "Threefold Truth" linking them.

## 6. Key Tiantai Terminology

*   **Threefold Truth (Sāndì 三諦):** Empty (Kōng), Provisional (Jiǎ), Middle (Zhōng).
*   **Three Thousand Realms in a Single Moment (Yīniàn Sānqiān 一念三千):** The mutual inclusion of all phenomena.
*   **Ten Suchnesses (Shí Rúshì 十如是):** Appearance, Nature, Substance, Power, Function, Causes, Conditions, Effects, Retributions, Equality.
*   **Five Periods (Wǔshí 五時):** Avatamsaka, Agama, Vaipulya, Prajna, Lotus-Nirvana.

## 7. Getting Started

1.  **Select a Text:** Choose *Xuanyi* (Theory) or *Mohe Zhiguan* (Practice).
2.  **Locate Source:** Retrieve the relevant fascicle from `02_SOURCE_MATERIALS`.
3.  **Activate Agents:** Engage The Architect for the draft, then The Practitioner for the polish.
