# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 2: Opening the Gate (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun’s 'Two Wisdoms' theory was revolutionary for the Liang Dynasty. He was the first to systematically explain how the Buddha’s mind handles the 'One' vs. the 'Many.' However, Zhiyi felt Fayun’s 'Ten Suchnesses' analysis was too rigid."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the Two Wisdoms
*   **Fayun's View:** Real Wisdom is for the Buddha's own realization; Expedient Wisdom is for saving others. They are like two separate tools.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi introduces **'The Non-Duality of the Two Wisdoms' (*Èr Zhì Bù Èr*)**. For Zhiyi, Expedient Wisdom *is* Real Wisdom in action. You can't have one without the other. He uses the metaphor of the **'Gem in the Robe'**—the wealth (Real) is always there, even when you're working for wages (Expedient).

### 2. On the Ten Suchnesses (The Famous Battle)
*   **Fayun's View:** He divides the ten into two halves (5 Provisional, 4 Real, 1 Synthesis).
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** This is one of Zhiyi's most famous rebuttals in the *Fahua Xuanyi*. Zhiyi argues that **each of the Ten Suchnesses is simultaneously Empty, Provisional, and Middle**. You can't say the first five are just 'provisional.' Appearance *is* Reality. This leads to the Tiantai doctrine of **'The Threefold Truth in a Single Thought' (*Yīniàn Sānqiān*)**, which completely replaces Fayun's binary division.

### 3. On 'One Principle' (Li Yi)
*   **Fayun's View:** The goal is the 'One Principle' of Emptiness.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Fayun’s 'One Principle' is still too close to the 'Analytical Emptiness' of the Hinayana. Zhiyi proposes the **'Middle Way'** which includes both Emptiness and the wonderful existence of the world.
