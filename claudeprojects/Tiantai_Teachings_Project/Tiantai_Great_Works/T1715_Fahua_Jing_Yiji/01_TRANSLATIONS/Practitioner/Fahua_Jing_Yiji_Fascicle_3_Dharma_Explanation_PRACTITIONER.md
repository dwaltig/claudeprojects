# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 3: The Structural Blueprint (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun’s 'Four Unities' and his 'Three Capacities' division became the standard structure for all future Lotus Sutra commentaries. Master Zhiyi kept this structure but completely re-engineered the interior logic."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the Four Unities
*   **Fayun's View:** The Four Unities are four separate categories used to prove the One Vehicle.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi argues that these are not four separate things, but **Four Perspectives on the Single Reality**. He integrates them into the **Threefold Truth**. For example, the 'Unity of Cause' is the Provisional, the 'Unity of Fruit' is the Empty, and the 'Unity of Person' is the Middle. Fayun analyzes them; Zhiyi synthesizes them.

### 2. On the Three Capacities
*   **Fayun's View:** People are naturally divided into High, Middle, and Low. The Buddha speaks differently to each.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi introduces the idea of **'Interpenetrating Capacity'**. He argues that even a person of 'Low' capacity possesses the 'High' capacity nature. The Buddha isn't just speaking 'down' to the low; he is speaking to the **Hidden Greatness** within the small.
