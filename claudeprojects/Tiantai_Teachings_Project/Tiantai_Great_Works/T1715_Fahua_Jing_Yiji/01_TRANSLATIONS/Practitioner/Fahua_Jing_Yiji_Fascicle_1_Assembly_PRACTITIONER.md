# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 1: The Hierarchy of the Assembly (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun is very structured here. He divides the assembly strictly by 'Inner' (Arhats) and 'Outer' (Bodhisattvas). This reflects the Liang Dynasty's emphasis on monastic hierarchy."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. The 12,000 vs. The 80,000
*   **Fayun's View:** The Arhats are listed first because they are 'close' (*qīn*) to the Buddha physically. The Bodhisattvas are 'distant' (*shū*) because they travel.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi agrees but adds a doctrinal layer. The Arhats represent the **Trace (*Jī*)**—the provisional teaching. The Bodhisattvas represent the **Origin (*Běn*)**—the eternal reality. Listing the Arhats first shows the 'opening of the Trace' to reveal the Origin.

### 2. The Definition of Arhat
*   **Fayun's View:** Standard Hinayana definitions (Killer of Thieves, Non-Birth, Worthy of Offerings).
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi accepts these but adds the **Mahayana interpretation**. 'Killer of Thieves' now includes killing the 'thief of ignorance' (*wúmíng*). 'Non-Birth' now means realizing the 'Non-Arising of Dharmas' (*Wúshēng Fǎrěn*). Fayun treats them as static goals; Zhiyi treats them as stages on the way to Buddhahood.

### 3. The 'Four Kinds of Believers'
*   **Fayun's View:** Monks, Nuns, Laymen, Laywomen. Simple categories.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi sees the assembly as a **Mandala of the Dharma Realm**. The presence of the Dragon King's daughter, the devas, and the humans shows that *all* beings possess the Buddha-nature. It's not just a roll call; it's a statement of universal salvation.
