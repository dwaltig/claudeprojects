# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 7: The Mirage of Nirvana (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun’s explanation of the Phantom City as a 'necessary lie' or a 'rest stop' is the standard interpretation. But Tiantai looks deeper into the *nature* of the city itself. Is the city actually 'unreal'?"

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the 'Rest Stop'
*   **Fayun's View:** Nirvana is a temporary rest stop. Once you are rested, the Buddha 'vanishes' the city and makes you walk the rest of the way.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi argues that the **City *is* the Treasure Land** if you view it correctly. The Phantom City represents the **Provisional Truth**, and the Treasure Land represents the **Middle Way**. You don't leave the city; you realize that the 'City' (Nirvana) was just a partial view of the 'Treasure' (Buddhahood). This is the **'Non-Duality of the Provisional and the Real'**.

### 2. On the 500 Yojanas
*   **Fayun's View:** 300 yojanas to Arhatship, 200 yojanas more to Buddhahood. It’s a linear path.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi views the 500 yojanas as the **Five Dwellings of Affliction**.
    1.  Views (100)
    2.  Attachment to Desire (200)
    3.  Attachment to Form (300)
    4.  Attachment to the Formless (400)
    5.  Ignorance (500)
    Arhatship only clears the first four. Only the Lotus clearing the fifth (Ignorance) reaches the Treasure.

### 3. On the 'Guide's Intent'
*   **Fayun's View:** The Guide (Buddha) conjures the city to trick the people into not giving up.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi calls this **'The Inconceivable Use of the Provisional'**. The Buddha isn't 'tricking' them; he is manifesting the **Triple Truth**. The Phantom City is the 'Emptiness' side; the Treasure Land is the 'Middle' side. They are two ways of looking at the same step.
# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 8: Eternity vs. Infinity (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"This is the doctrinal climax of the Lotus Sutra. Fayun’s 'Long but Finite' view was the standard interpretation of the time. But Master Zhiyi saw this as a profound misunderstanding of the Buddha's nature."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the Life Span
*   **Fayun's View:** The Buddha's life is finite. It’s just very, very long. He treats the Buddha as a super-human being within time.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi argues for **Absolute Eternity (*Chángzhù*)**. The Buddha's life span is the **Dharmakaya** itself. It has no beginning and no end. To say it is 'finite' is to fall back into the 'Provisional' view. Zhiyi’s 'Opening the Trace to Reveal the Origin' means realizing that the Buddha *is* the life of the universe.

### 2. On the Physician's Death
*   **Fayun's View:** The Buddha pretends to die to make people value the Dharma.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi uses the **'Non-Duality of Life and Death'**. The Buddha is always present on **Gridhrakuta Mountain** (Spirit Vulture Peak). His 'death' is an illusion for those with 'blurred vision' (*yǎn yì*). The 'Medicine' is the realization that the Father never left.

### 3. On the Three Times (Past, Present, Future)
*   **Fayun's View:** Chronological stages of the Buddha's career.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi collapses the Three Times into the **Single Thought**. The past enlightenment, the present teaching, and the future Nirvana are all contained in the **Three Thousand Realms in a Single Thought**.
