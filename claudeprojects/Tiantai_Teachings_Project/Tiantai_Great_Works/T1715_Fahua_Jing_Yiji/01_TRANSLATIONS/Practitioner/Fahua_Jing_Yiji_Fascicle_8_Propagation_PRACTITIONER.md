# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 8: The Roots of the Eternal (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun treats the Earth Bodhisattvas as 'Old Friends' from the past. But Tiantai sees them as the **Primary Subject of the Eternal Buddha**."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the Earth Bodhisattvas
*   **Fayun's View:** Disciples from the distant past.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi argues that these Bodhisattvas are the **Eternal Retinue**. They are always present, always teaching, always enlightening. Their emergence 'cracks open' the view of the recent Buddha (Shakyamuni) to reveal the Eternal Buddha. The 'Earth' they come from is the **Ground of Ultimate Reality**.

### 2. On the Merit of the 50th Person
*   **Fayun's View:** A quantitative comparison. 1 > 50 > Charity.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi sees this as the **'Transfer of the Essence'**. The merit doesn't dilute as it passes down the line. The 50th person receives the *same* Buddha-seed as the 1st. It proves that the nature of the Lotus Sutra is **Holographic**—the whole is present in every part.

### 3. On the Transmission
*   **Fayun's View:** A series of encouraging stories.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi sees the final chapters as the **'Function of the Origin' (*Běn Yòng*)**. The Bodhisattvas (Avalokiteshvara, etc.) are the hands and eyes of the Eternal Buddha reaching into the world. They are not just models; they are the **Living Activity of the Lotus** in the phenomenal world.
