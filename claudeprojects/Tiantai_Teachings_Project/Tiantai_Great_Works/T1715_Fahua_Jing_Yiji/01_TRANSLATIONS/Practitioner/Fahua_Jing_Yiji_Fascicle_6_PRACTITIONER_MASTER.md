# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 6: The Guarantee of Buddhahood (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun sees the prophecies as a list of future events. He treats them like a legal document ensuring an inheritance. But for Tiantai, the prophecy is the **Activation of the Buddha-Nature**."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the Sequence of Prophecies
*   **Fayun's View:** Chronological sequence based on respect and age.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi sees the sequence as representing the **Four Siddhāntas** (Modes of Teaching).
    *   *Mahakashyapa:* The 'Ultimate' Siddhānta (Pure Truth).
    *   *Subhuti:* The 'Individual' Siddhānta (Personal Growth).
    *   *The rest:* The 'Counteractive' and 'Worldly' Siddhāntas.
    The prophecies are tailored to how each Arhat perceives the **Triple Truth**.

### 2. On the Buddha-Names
*   **Fayun's View:** A new identity for the future.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi argues that the future Buddha-name is actually the **Arhat's Original Name**. It’s the name they had 'before the kalpas.' The prophecy isn't giving them something new; it's revealing who they have **Always Been**.

### 3. On the '500 Disciples'
*   **Fayun's View:** A mass prophecy for the lower-ranking monks.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi uses the 500 Disciples to illustrate **'Universal Inheritance'**. It doesn't matter if you're a famous Arhat or an unknown monk; if you are in the assembly, you are an heir. This proves the **Inconceivable Power** of the One Vehicle.
