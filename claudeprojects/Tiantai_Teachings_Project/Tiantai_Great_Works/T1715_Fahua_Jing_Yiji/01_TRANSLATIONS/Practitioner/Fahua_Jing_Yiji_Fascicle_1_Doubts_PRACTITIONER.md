# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 1: The Lineage of Wisdom (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun focuses heavily on the *structure* of the Q&A (3 thoughts, 4 stages). He treats the story of Sun-Moon-Lamp Buddha as a historical proof text—a legal precedent. Tiantai sees it as a **Pattern of Cyclic Manifestation**."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On Maitreya's Doubt
*   **Fayun's View:** Maitreya truly didn't know. He's a 'Trace Bodhisattva' (*Jī Púsà*) who hasn't reached the full omniscience of a Buddha yet.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi argues Maitreya *pretended* not to know (**Shì Yí** - Manifested Doubt) for the sake of the assembly. As the next Buddha, Maitreya surely understands the Buddha's intent. He acts as the 'Influential Party' (*Yǐngxiǎng Zhòng*) to initiate the discourse.

### 2. On Sun-Moon-Lamp Buddha
*   **Fayun's View:** A historical Buddha who sets the precedent. The name represents his wisdom (Light) shining like the sun and moon.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi interprets the name doctrinally.
    *   **Sun/Moon:** The 'Relative' Wisdom (*Quán Zhì*) illuminating the world.
    *   **Lamp:** The 'Absolute' Wisdom (*Shí Zhì*) illuminating the inner chamber (Truth).
    *   The succession of **20,000 Buddhas** with the same name represents the transmission of the One Truth through endless ages.

### 3. On 'Seeker of Fame' (Maitreya)
*   **Fayun's View:** Maitreya was actually lazy and sought fame in the past, hence his name.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi defends Maitreya. 'Seeking Fame' was a form of **Skillful Means**. By seeking fame, he mingled with all classes of society to save them. It wasn't a flaw; it was a strategy. This is the **'Benefit of the Trace'** (*Jī Yì*).
