# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 7: The Mirage of Nirvana (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun’s explanation of the Phantom City as a 'necessary lie' or a 'rest stop' is the standard interpretation. But Tiantai looks deeper into the *nature* of the city itself. Is the city actually 'unreal'?"

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the 'Rest Stop'
*   **Fayun's View:** Nirvana is a temporary rest stop. Once you are rested, the Buddha 'vanishes' the city and makes you walk the rest of the way.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi argues that the **City *is* the Treasure Land** if you view it correctly. The Phantom City represents the **Provisional Truth**, and the Treasure Land represents the **Middle Way**. You don't leave the city; you realize that the 'City' (Nirvana) was just a partial view of the 'Treasure' (Buddhahood). This is the **'Non-Duality of the Provisional and the Real'**.

### 2. On the 500 Yojanas
*   **Fayun's View:** 300 yojanas to Arhatship, 200 yojanas more to Buddhahood. It’s a linear path.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi views the 500 yojanas as the **Five Dwellings of Affliction**.
    1.  Views (100)
    2.  Attachment to Desire (200)
    3.  Attachment to Form (300)
    4.  Attachment to the Formless (400)
    5.  Ignorance (500)
    Arhatship only clears the first four. Only the Lotus clearing the fifth (Ignorance) reaches the Treasure.

### 3. On the 'Guide's Intent'
*   **Fayun's View:** The Guide (Buddha) conjures the city to trick the people into not giving up.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi calls this **'The Inconceivable Use of the Provisional'**. The Buddha isn't 'tricking' them; he is manifesting the **Triple Truth**. The Phantom City is the 'Emptiness' side; the Treasure Land is the 'Middle' side. They are two ways of looking at the same step.
# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 7: The Meeting of Past and Present (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun provides a very clear, structural analysis of the Stupa. He sees it as a 'Proof of Authenticity.' But Tiantai sees the Stupa as the **Mandala of the Threefold Truth**."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the Two Buddhas
*   **Fayun's View:** Past witnessing Present. Origin witnessing Trace.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi interprets the two Buddhas as **Wisdom (*Zhì*)** and **Truth (*Lǐ*)**.
    *   *Shakyamuni:* The Subjective Wisdom that realizes the Truth.
    *   *Many Jewels:* The Objective Truth that is realized.
    *   *Seated Together:* The **Fusion of Wisdom and Truth (*Lǐ Zhì Míng Hé*)**. This is the state of Enlightenment itself.

### 2. On the Stupa Rising from the Earth
*   **Fayun's View:** A miracle to inspire awe.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** The Earth represents the **Field of Reality**. The Stupa rising represents the **Emergence of the Buddha-Nature** from within the afflictions of the world. It is not coming from 'outside'; it is coming from 'beneath' (within).

### 3. On the 'Assembly in Space'
*   **Fayun's View:** The Buddha lifts the assembly into the air to hear the final teaching (Transmission).
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** This is the **'Ceremony in Space' (*Xūkōng Huì*)**. It represents the transcendence of all attachments. Leaving the ground means leaving the 'Relative' truth to dwell in the 'Absolute' emptiness, before returning to the world in the final chapters.
