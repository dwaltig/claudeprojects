# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 3: The Great Cart Debate (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"This is the heart of the disagreement that defined the Tiantai school. Fayun’s 'Four Vehicle' theory was the dominant view until Zhiyi dismantled it. It’s a battle over whether the One Vehicle is *separate* from the Three or *identical* to them."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the 'Fourth Vehicle'
*   **Fayun's View:** The Three Carts are provisional; the Great White Ox Cart is a separate, fourth, real cart. (3 + 1 = 4).
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** This is Zhiyi's sharpest point in the *Fahua Xuanyi*. He argues that if there is a 'Fourth Cart,' then the Buddha *did* lie to the children. Zhiyi’s view is **'Three Carts are the One Vehicle' (*Sān Chē Jí Yī Shèng*)**.
    *   The 'Ox Cart' promised at the gate *is* the 'Great White Ox Cart' given at the end. The only difference is the *perception* of the practitioner. The 'provisional' is just the 'real' not yet fully understood.

### 2. On the Ten Metaphors
*   **Fayun's View:** A chronological timeline of the Buddha's life and teaching career.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi reinterprets these as the **Ten Suchnesses of the Burning House**.
    *   For example, the 'Fire' isn't just external suffering; it is the internal fire of **Ignorance** burning within the **Dharma Nature**. Zhiyi internalizes the parable into the mind of the practitioner.

### 3. On 'Requesting the Carts' (*Suǒ Chē*):
*   **Fayun's View:** Disciples asking for their 'wages' (Nirvana).
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi sees this as the **'Capacity of the Trace' (*Jī Jī*)**. The disciples are not 'begging'; their practice has naturally matured to the point where the 'Provisional' can no longer contain them. They are 'pulling' the 'Real' out of the Buddha.
