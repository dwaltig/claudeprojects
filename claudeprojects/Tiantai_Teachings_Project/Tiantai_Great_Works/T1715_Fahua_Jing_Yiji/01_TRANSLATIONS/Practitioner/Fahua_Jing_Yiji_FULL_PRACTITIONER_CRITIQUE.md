# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 1: The Pre-Tiantai Benchmark (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun’s commentary was the 'Gold Standard' of his time. He was the first to really nail down the logic of why the Lotus Sutra is 'Subtle' by comparing it to previous teachings. But when Master Zhiyi got hold of this, he felt Fayun hadn't gone deep enough."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On 'Subtle' (Miao)
*   **Fayun's View:** 'Subtle' means 'superior to the coarse.' It’s a relative comparison (*Xiāngdài Miào*).
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi argues that if 'Subtle' only exists in comparison to 'Coarse,' it’s still trapped in duality. Zhiyi introduces the **'Absolute Subtlety' (*Juéduì Miào*)**, where the Coarse *is* the Subtle. He expands Fayun's 3 meanings into **30 meanings** (10 for the Traces, 10 for the Origin, 10 for the Mind).

### 2. On the Lotus Metaphor
*   **Fayun's View:** The Lotus represents the 'simultaneity of Cause and Fruit' (the flower and the seed pod appearing at once).
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi finds this too simple. He develops the **Three Pairs of Metaphors** for the Lotus:
    1.  *Flower for the sake of Fruit:* Providing the Trace to reveal the Origin.
    2.  *Flower opening to reveal Fruit:* Stripping the Trace to show the Origin.
    3.  *Flower falling and Fruit remaining:* Discarding the Trace once the Origin is established.
    Fayun only sees the 'simultaneity,' while Zhiyi sees the 'evolution' of the teaching.

### 3. The 'Four Vehicles' Trap
*   **Fayun's View:** Famous for the 'Four Vehicles' (Sheep, Deer, Ox carts = 3; Great White Ox cart = 4). He thinks the Buddha gives a *new, fourth* cart.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** This is the big one. Zhiyi argues that there is no 'Fourth' vehicle. The **Three Carts *are* the One Vehicle**. If the Buddha gives a fourth cart, it implies the first three were lies. For Zhiyi, the 'White Ox' is the realization that the previous three were always the One Vehicle in disguise.
# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 1: The Hierarchy of the Assembly (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun is very structured here. He divides the assembly strictly by 'Inner' (Arhats) and 'Outer' (Bodhisattvas). This reflects the Liang Dynasty's emphasis on monastic hierarchy."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. The 12,000 vs. The 80,000
*   **Fayun's View:** The Arhats are listed first because they are 'close' (*qīn*) to the Buddha physically. The Bodhisattvas are 'distant' (*shū*) because they travel.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi agrees but adds a doctrinal layer. The Arhats represent the **Trace (*Jī*)**—the provisional teaching. The Bodhisattvas represent the **Origin (*Běn*)**—the eternal reality. Listing the Arhats first shows the 'opening of the Trace' to reveal the Origin.

### 2. The Definition of Arhat
*   **Fayun's View:** Standard Hinayana definitions (Killer of Thieves, Non-Birth, Worthy of Offerings).
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi accepts these but adds the **Mahayana interpretation**. 'Killer of Thieves' now includes killing the 'thief of ignorance' (*wúmíng*). 'Non-Birth' now means realizing the 'Non-Arising of Dharmas' (*Wúshēng Fǎrěn*). Fayun treats them as static goals; Zhiyi treats them as stages on the way to Buddhahood.

### 3. The 'Four Kinds of Believers'
*   **Fayun's View:** Monks, Nuns, Laymen, Laywomen. Simple categories.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi sees the assembly as a **Mandala of the Dharma Realm**. The presence of the Dragon King's daughter, the devas, and the humans shows that *all* beings possess the Buddha-nature. It's not just a roll call; it's a statement of universal salvation.
# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 1: The Prelude to the Lotus (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun provides a solid, standard breakdown of the Six Portents. His analysis of the *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra* as the 'Roaming Preface' is standard but crucial. However, Tiantai will take this much further."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the 'Roaming Preface' (*Yóu Xù*)
*   **Fayun's View:** The *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra* is a 'preface' because it was preached right before the Lotus. It's connected by proximity.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi agrees but adds the **'Opening the Gate'** aspect. The *Immeasurable Meanings* teaches that 'From the One Law, immeasurable meanings are born.' This is the **Relative** view (One produces Many). The *Lotus* will teach that 'Immeasurable meanings return to the One.' This is the **Absolute** view (Many return to One). They are doctrinally locked together as 'Opening' and 'Closing.'

### 2. On the Six Portents
*   **Fayun's View:** These are miracles to startle the audience and make them pay attention.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi interprets them as **Similes for the Ten Suchnesses**.
    *   *Earth Shaking:* Transforming the 'Environment' (Place).
    *   *Flower Rain:* The blossoming of the 'Cause' (Practice).
    *   *Light:* The illumination of 'Wisdom' (Nature).
    Zhiyi sees the portents not just as magic, but as *physical manifestations of the doctrine itself*.

### 3. On 'Illuminating the East'
*   **Fayun's View:** East = Rising Sun = Beginning.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi connects the 'East' to the **Spring**, to **Wood**, and to **Benevolence (*Rén*)**. But more importantly, the light illuminates the *18,000 worlds*, which Zhiyi interprets as the **18 Realms** (6 Senses + 6 Objects + 6 Consciousnesses) of the **Ten Dharma Realms** (18 x 1000 = 18,000, roughly). It symbolizes the **Three Thousand Realms in a Single Thought**.
# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 1: The Lineage of Wisdom (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun focuses heavily on the *structure* of the Q&A (3 thoughts, 4 stages). He treats the story of Sun-Moon-Lamp Buddha as a historical proof text—a legal precedent. Tiantai sees it as a **Pattern of Cyclic Manifestation**."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On Maitreya's Doubt
*   **Fayun's View:** Maitreya truly didn't know. He's a 'Trace Bodhisattva' (*Jī Púsà*) who hasn't reached the full omniscience of a Buddha yet.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi argues Maitreya *pretended* not to know (**Shì Yí** - Manifested Doubt) for the sake of the assembly. As the next Buddha, Maitreya surely understands the Buddha's intent. He acts as the 'Influential Party' (*Yǐngxiǎng Zhòng*) to initiate the discourse.

### 2. On Sun-Moon-Lamp Buddha
*   **Fayun's View:** A historical Buddha who sets the precedent. The name represents his wisdom (Light) shining like the sun and moon.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi interprets the name doctrinally.
    *   **Sun/Moon:** The 'Relative' Wisdom (*Quán Zhì*) illuminating the world.
    *   **Lamp:** The 'Absolute' Wisdom (*Shí Zhì*) illuminating the inner chamber (Truth).
    *   The succession of **20,000 Buddhas** with the same name represents the transmission of the One Truth through endless ages.

### 3. On 'Seeker of Fame' (Maitreya)
*   **Fayun's View:** Maitreya was actually lazy and sought fame in the past, hence his name.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi defends Maitreya. 'Seeking Fame' was a form of **Skillful Means**. By seeking fame, he mingled with all classes of society to save them. It wasn't a flaw; it was a strategy. This is the **'Benefit of the Trace'** (*Jī Yì*).
# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 2: Opening the Gate (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun’s 'Two Wisdoms' theory was revolutionary for the Liang Dynasty. He was the first to systematically explain how the Buddha’s mind handles the 'One' vs. the 'Many.' However, Zhiyi felt Fayun’s 'Ten Suchnesses' analysis was too rigid."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the Two Wisdoms
*   **Fayun's View:** Real Wisdom is for the Buddha's own realization; Expedient Wisdom is for saving others. They are like two separate tools.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi introduces **'The Non-Duality of the Two Wisdoms' (*Èr Zhì Bù Èr*)**. For Zhiyi, Expedient Wisdom *is* Real Wisdom in action. You can't have one without the other. He uses the metaphor of the **'Gem in the Robe'**—the wealth (Real) is always there, even when you're working for wages (Expedient).

### 2. On the Ten Suchnesses (The Famous Battle)
*   **Fayun's View:** He divides the ten into two halves (5 Provisional, 4 Real, 1 Synthesis).
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** This is one of Zhiyi's most famous rebuttals in the *Fahua Xuanyi*. Zhiyi argues that **each of the Ten Suchnesses is simultaneously Empty, Provisional, and Middle**. You can't say the first five are just 'provisional.' Appearance *is* Reality. This leads to the Tiantai doctrine of **'The Threefold Truth in a Single Thought' (*Yīniàn Sānqiān*)**, which completely replaces Fayun's binary division.

### 3. On 'One Principle' (Li Yi)
*   **Fayun's View:** The goal is the 'One Principle' of Emptiness.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Fayun’s 'One Principle' is still too close to the 'Analytical Emptiness' of the Hinayana. Zhiyi proposes the **'Middle Way'** which includes both Emptiness and the wonderful existence of the world.
# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 2/3: The Filter of the Dharma (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun’s explanation of the 5,000 departures is very logical. He sees it as a pragmatic 'sorting' of the audience. But Tiantai sees this moment as a **Cosmic Revelation of Capacity**."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the 'Three Requests'
*   **Fayun's View:** A psychological tool to make people want the teaching more.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi sees the three requests as representing the **Three Wisdoms** (Sariputra requests with the wisdom of the 'One,' the 'Provisional,' and the 'Middle'). The Buddha’s refusals represent the **Three Secret Intentions** of the Buddha. It’s a formal 'Dharma Combat' that establishes the authority of the One Vehicle.

### 2. On the 5,000 Departures
*   **Fayun's View:** They were 'Arrogant' (*Zēngshàngmàn*) and couldn't handle the truth. Better they leave.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi adds a terrifying layer. He argues that these 5,000 were **'Rootless' (*Wú Gēn*)** in *this* life, but the Buddha's silence was a **Secret Seed**. By allowing them to leave, the Buddha actually planted the 'Lotus Seed' in their sub-consciousness. They will wander for eons, but because they *saw* the Buddha enter the Samadhi of the Lotus, they are already saved in the long run.

### 3. On 'Only Solid Trunks Remain'
*   **Fayun's View:** The group is now pure and high-quality.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi uses this to define **'Perfect Capacity' (*Yuán Jī*)**. The people who stayed aren't just 'good monks'; they are beings whose minds are perfectly aligned with the **Triple Truth**. They are the 'Solid Trunks' because they can support the weight of the Absolute Reality without breaking.
# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 3: The Structural Blueprint (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun’s 'Four Unities' and his 'Three Capacities' division became the standard structure for all future Lotus Sutra commentaries. Master Zhiyi kept this structure but completely re-engineered the interior logic."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the Four Unities
*   **Fayun's View:** The Four Unities are four separate categories used to prove the One Vehicle.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi argues that these are not four separate things, but **Four Perspectives on the Single Reality**. He integrates them into the **Threefold Truth**. For example, the 'Unity of Cause' is the Provisional, the 'Unity of Fruit' is the Empty, and the 'Unity of Person' is the Middle. Fayun analyzes them; Zhiyi synthesizes them.

### 2. On the Three Capacities
*   **Fayun's View:** People are naturally divided into High, Middle, and Low. The Buddha speaks differently to each.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi introduces the idea of **'Interpenetrating Capacity'**. He argues that even a person of 'Low' capacity possesses the 'High' capacity nature. The Buddha isn't just speaking 'down' to the low; he is speaking to the **Hidden Greatness** within the small.
# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 3: The Great Cart Debate (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"This is the heart of the disagreement that defined the Tiantai school. Fayun’s 'Four Vehicle' theory was the dominant view until Zhiyi dismantled it. It’s a battle over whether the One Vehicle is *separate* from the Three or *identical* to them."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the 'Fourth Vehicle'
*   **Fayun's View:** The Three Carts are provisional; the Great White Ox Cart is a separate, fourth, real cart. (3 + 1 = 4).
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** This is Zhiyi's sharpest point in the *Fahua Xuanyi*. He argues that if there is a 'Fourth Cart,' then the Buddha *did* lie to the children. Zhiyi’s view is **'Three Carts are the One Vehicle' (*Sān Chē Jí Yī Shèng*)**.
    *   The 'Ox Cart' promised at the gate *is* the 'Great White Ox Cart' given at the end. The only difference is the *perception* of the practitioner. The 'provisional' is just the 'real' not yet fully understood.

### 2. On the Ten Metaphors
*   **Fayun's View:** A chronological timeline of the Buddha's life and teaching career.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi reinterprets these as the **Ten Suchnesses of the Burning House**.
    *   For example, the 'Fire' isn't just external suffering; it is the internal fire of **Ignorance** burning within the **Dharma Nature**. Zhiyi internalizes the parable into the mind of the practitioner.

### 3. On 'Requesting the Carts' (*Suǒ Chē*):
*   **Fayun's View:** Disciples asking for their 'wages' (Nirvana).
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi sees this as the **'Capacity of the Trace' (*Jī Jī*)**. The disciples are not 'begging'; their practice has naturally matured to the point where the 'Provisional' can no longer contain them. They are 'pulling' the 'Real' out of the Buddha.
# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 4: The Wages of Nirvana (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun’s alignment of the 'Poor Son' stages with the Five Periods of teaching (especially the *Prajna* connection) is brilliant and was largely adopted by later schools. However, his view of the 'Dung' and the 'Wages' is where Tiantai adds its own flavor."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On 'Clearing Dung' (*Chú Fèn*)
*   **Fayun's View:** Dung represents the gross afflictions of the Three Realms. 'Clearing' it is the Hinayana practice of Arhatship.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi agrees but adds the **'Dung of Views' (*Jiàn Fèn*)**. He argues that even the attachment to Arhatship itself is a form of 'dung' that needs to be cleared before the One Vehicle inheritance can be accepted.

### 2. On the 'Accounts' (*Cáiwù*)
*   **Fayun's View:** Managing the accounts is the *Prajna* period where Arhats taught Mahayana to others.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi calls this **'Secret Influence' (*An Zhù*)**. The Buddha was 'tricking' the Arhats into becoming Bodhisattvas without them knowing it. By making them handle the 'wealth' (the logic of Emptiness), he was secretly expanding their capacity until it could match his own.

### 3. On the 'Sick Father' (*Zhǎngzhě Yǒu Jí*)
*   **Fayun's View:** The Father being 'sick and near death' represents the Buddha reaching the end of his physical life (approaching the *Nirvana Sutra*).
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi interprets 'Sickness' as the **Buddha's Compassion**. The Buddha is 'sick' because sentient beings are sick. The 'Near Death' is the final stage of **Skillful Means** where the provisional forms must die so the Eternal Buddha can be revealed.
# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 5: The Forest of Capacities (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun’s classification is neat and tidy. He assigns each plant to a specific rank. It’s a very hierarchical, 'Liang Dynasty' way of looking at the world. But for Master Zhiyi, this misses the **Simultaneity** of the Lotus."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the 'Small Grass' (Humans/Devas)
*   **Fayun's View:** They are the lowest, merely seeking worldly benefit.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi argues that in the Lotus Sutra, even the 'Small Grass' is **'Secretly One Vehicle.'** The rain they receive is the Buddha-wisdom. Even if they don't know it, the seed of Buddhahood is being watered. Fayun sees them as stuck in their rank; Zhiyi sees them as Buddhas-in-waiting.

### 2. On the 'Two Trees'
*   **Fayun's View:** These are the elite Bodhisattvas.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi uses the 'Two Trees' to illustrate the **Interpenetration of the Grounds**. A 'Large Tree' isn't just bigger; it's a manifestation of the **Whole Forest** (the Dharma Realm). He critiques Fayun for treating the ranks as separate silos rather than a continuous, integrated whole.

### 3. On 'One Taste' (*Yī Wèi*)
*   **Fayun's View:** The rain is the same, but the plants are different. (Objective unity, subjective diversity).
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** This is where the **'Perfect Teaching' (*Yuán Jiào*)** comes in. Zhiyi says that from the Buddha's perspective, the **Plants are also the Rain**. There is no separation between the teacher, the teaching, and the student. This is the **'Non-Duality of Capacity and Response' (*Jī Yìng Bù Èr*)**.
# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 6: The Guarantee of Buddhahood (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun sees the prophecies as a list of future events. He treats them like a legal document ensuring an inheritance. But for Tiantai, the prophecy is the **Activation of the Buddha-Nature**."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the Sequence of Prophecies
*   **Fayun's View:** Chronological sequence based on respect and age.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi sees the sequence as representing the **Four Siddhāntas** (Modes of Teaching).
    *   *Mahakashyapa:* The 'Ultimate' Siddhānta (Pure Truth).
    *   *Subhuti:* The 'Individual' Siddhānta (Personal Growth).
    *   *The rest:* The 'Counteractive' and 'Worldly' Siddhāntas.
    The prophecies are tailored to how each Arhat perceives the **Triple Truth**.

### 2. On the Buddha-Names
*   **Fayun's View:** A new identity for the future.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi argues that the future Buddha-name is actually the **Arhat's Original Name**. It’s the name they had 'before the kalpas.' The prophecy isn't giving them something new; it's revealing who they have **Always Been**.

### 3. On the '500 Disciples'
*   **Fayun's View:** A mass prophecy for the lower-ranking monks.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi uses the 500 Disciples to illustrate **'Universal Inheritance'**. It doesn't matter if you're a famous Arhat or an unknown monk; if you are in the assembly, you are an heir. This proves the **Inconceivable Power** of the One Vehicle.
# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 7: The Mirage of Nirvana (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun’s explanation of the Phantom City as a 'necessary lie' or a 'rest stop' is the standard interpretation. But Tiantai looks deeper into the *nature* of the city itself. Is the city actually 'unreal'?"

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the 'Rest Stop'
*   **Fayun's View:** Nirvana is a temporary rest stop. Once you are rested, the Buddha 'vanishes' the city and makes you walk the rest of the way.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi argues that the **City *is* the Treasure Land** if you view it correctly. The Phantom City represents the **Provisional Truth**, and the Treasure Land represents the **Middle Way**. You don't leave the city; you realize that the 'City' (Nirvana) was just a partial view of the 'Treasure' (Buddhahood). This is the **'Non-Duality of the Provisional and the Real'**.

### 2. On the 500 Yojanas
*   **Fayun's View:** 300 yojanas to Arhatship, 200 yojanas more to Buddhahood. It’s a linear path.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi views the 500 yojanas as the **Five Dwellings of Affliction**.
    1.  Views (100)
    2.  Attachment to Desire (200)
    3.  Attachment to Form (300)
    4.  Attachment to the Formless (400)
    5.  Ignorance (500)
    Arhatship only clears the first four. Only the Lotus clearing the fifth (Ignorance) reaches the Treasure.

### 3. On the 'Guide's Intent'
*   **Fayun's View:** The Guide (Buddha) conjures the city to trick the people into not giving up.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi calls this **'The Inconceivable Use of the Provisional'**. The Buddha isn't 'tricking' them; he is manifesting the **Triple Truth**. The Phantom City is the 'Emptiness' side; the Treasure Land is the 'Middle' side. They are two ways of looking at the same step.
# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 7: The Meeting of Past and Present (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun provides a very clear, structural analysis of the Stupa. He sees it as a 'Proof of Authenticity.' But Tiantai sees the Stupa as the **Mandala of the Threefold Truth**."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the Two Buddhas
*   **Fayun's View:** Past witnessing Present. Origin witnessing Trace.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi interprets the two Buddhas as **Wisdom (*Zhì*)** and **Truth (*Lǐ*)**.
    *   *Shakyamuni:* The Subjective Wisdom that realizes the Truth.
    *   *Many Jewels:* The Objective Truth that is realized.
    *   *Seated Together:* The **Fusion of Wisdom and Truth (*Lǐ Zhì Míng Hé*)**. This is the state of Enlightenment itself.

### 2. On the Stupa Rising from the Earth
*   **Fayun's View:** A miracle to inspire awe.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** The Earth represents the **Field of Reality**. The Stupa rising represents the **Emergence of the Buddha-Nature** from within the afflictions of the world. It is not coming from 'outside'; it is coming from 'beneath' (within).

### 3. On the 'Assembly in Space'
*   **Fayun's View:** The Buddha lifts the assembly into the air to hear the final teaching (Transmission).
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** This is the **'Ceremony in Space' (*Xūkōng Huì*)**. It represents the transcendence of all attachments. Leaving the ground means leaving the 'Relative' truth to dwell in the 'Absolute' emptiness, before returning to the world in the final chapters.
# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 8: Eternity vs. Infinity (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"This is the doctrinal climax of the Lotus Sutra. Fayun’s 'Long but Finite' view was the standard interpretation of the time. But Master Zhiyi saw this as a profound misunderstanding of the Buddha's nature."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the Life Span
*   **Fayun's View:** The Buddha's life is finite. It’s just very, very long. He treats the Buddha as a super-human being within time.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi argues for **Absolute Eternity (*Chángzhù*)**. The Buddha's life span is the **Dharmakaya** itself. It has no beginning and no end. To say it is 'finite' is to fall back into the 'Provisional' view. Zhiyi’s 'Opening the Trace to Reveal the Origin' means realizing that the Buddha *is* the life of the universe.

### 2. On the Physician's Death
*   **Fayun's View:** The Buddha pretends to die to make people value the Dharma.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi uses the **'Non-Duality of Life and Death'**. The Buddha is always present on **Gridhrakuta Mountain** (Spirit Vulture Peak). His 'death' is an illusion for those with 'blurred vision' (*yǎn yì*). The 'Medicine' is the realization that the Father never left.

### 3. On the Three Times (Past, Present, Future)
*   **Fayun's View:** Chronological stages of the Buddha's career.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi collapses the Three Times into the **Single Thought**. The past enlightenment, the present teaching, and the future Nirvana are all contained in the **Three Thousand Realms in a Single Thought**.
# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 8: The Roots of the Eternal (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun treats the Earth Bodhisattvas as 'Old Friends' from the past. But Tiantai sees them as the **Primary Subject of the Eternal Buddha**."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the Earth Bodhisattvas
*   **Fayun's View:** Disciples from the distant past.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi argues that these Bodhisattvas are the **Eternal Retinue**. They are always present, always teaching, always enlightening. Their emergence 'cracks open' the view of the recent Buddha (Shakyamuni) to reveal the Eternal Buddha. The 'Earth' they come from is the **Ground of Ultimate Reality**.

### 2. On the Merit of the 50th Person
*   **Fayun's View:** A quantitative comparison. 1 > 50 > Charity.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi sees this as the **'Transfer of the Essence'**. The merit doesn't dilute as it passes down the line. The 50th person receives the *same* Buddha-seed as the 1st. It proves that the nature of the Lotus Sutra is **Holographic**—the whole is present in every part.

### 3. On the Transmission
*   **Fayun's View:** A series of encouraging stories.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi sees the final chapters as the **'Function of the Origin' (*Běn Yòng*)**. The Bodhisattvas (Avalokiteshvara, etc.) are the hands and eyes of the Eternal Buddha reaching into the world. They are not just models; they are the **Living Activity of the Lotus** in the phenomenal world.
