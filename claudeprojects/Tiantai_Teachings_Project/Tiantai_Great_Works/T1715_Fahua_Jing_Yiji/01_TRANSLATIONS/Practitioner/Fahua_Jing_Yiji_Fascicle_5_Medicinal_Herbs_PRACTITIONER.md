# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 5: The Forest of Capacities (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun’s classification is neat and tidy. He assigns each plant to a specific rank. It’s a very hierarchical, 'Liang Dynasty' way of looking at the world. But for Master Zhiyi, this misses the **Simultaneity** of the Lotus."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the 'Small Grass' (Humans/Devas)
*   **Fayun's View:** They are the lowest, merely seeking worldly benefit.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi argues that in the Lotus Sutra, even the 'Small Grass' is **'Secretly One Vehicle.'** The rain they receive is the Buddha-wisdom. Even if they don't know it, the seed of Buddhahood is being watered. Fayun sees them as stuck in their rank; Zhiyi sees them as Buddhas-in-waiting.

### 2. On the 'Two Trees'
*   **Fayun's View:** These are the elite Bodhisattvas.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi uses the 'Two Trees' to illustrate the **Interpenetration of the Grounds**. A 'Large Tree' isn't just bigger; it's a manifestation of the **Whole Forest** (the Dharma Realm). He critiques Fayun for treating the ranks as separate silos rather than a continuous, integrated whole.

### 3. On 'One Taste' (*Yī Wèi*)
*   **Fayun's View:** The rain is the same, but the plants are different. (Objective unity, subjective diversity).
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** This is where the **'Perfect Teaching' (*Yuán Jiào*)** comes in. Zhiyi says that from the Buddha's perspective, the **Plants are also the Rain**. There is no separation between the teacher, the teaching, and the student. This is the **'Non-Duality of Capacity and Response' (*Jī Yìng Bù Èr*)**.
