# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 7: The Meeting of Past and Present (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun provides a very clear, structural analysis of the Stupa. He sees it as a 'Proof of Authenticity.' But Tiantai sees the Stupa as the **Mandala of the Threefold Truth**."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the Two Buddhas
*   **Fayun's View:** Past witnessing Present. Origin witnessing Trace.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi interprets the two Buddhas as **Wisdom (*Zhì*)** and **Truth (*Lǐ*)**.
    *   *Shakyamuni:* The Subjective Wisdom that realizes the Truth.
    *   *Many Jewels:* The Objective Truth that is realized.
    *   *Seated Together:* The **Fusion of Wisdom and Truth (*Lǐ Zhì Míng Hé*)**. This is the state of Enlightenment itself.

### 2. On the Stupa Rising from the Earth
*   **Fayun's View:** A miracle to inspire awe.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** The Earth represents the **Field of Reality**. The Stupa rising represents the **Emergence of the Buddha-Nature** from within the afflictions of the world. It is not coming from 'outside'; it is coming from 'beneath' (within).

### 3. On the 'Assembly in Space'
*   **Fayun's View:** The Buddha lifts the assembly into the air to hear the final teaching (Transmission).
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** This is the **'Ceremony in Space' (*Xūkōng Huì*)**. It represents the transcendence of all attachments. Leaving the ground means leaving the 'Relative' truth to dwell in the 'Absolute' emptiness, before returning to the world in the final chapters.
