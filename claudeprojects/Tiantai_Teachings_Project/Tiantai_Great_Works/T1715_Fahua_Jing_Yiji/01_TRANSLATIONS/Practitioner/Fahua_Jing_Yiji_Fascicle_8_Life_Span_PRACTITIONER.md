# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 8: Eternity vs. Infinity (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"This is the doctrinal climax of the Lotus Sutra. Fayun’s 'Long but Finite' view was the standard interpretation of the time. But Master Zhiyi saw this as a profound misunderstanding of the Buddha's nature."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the Life Span
*   **Fayun's View:** The Buddha's life is finite. It’s just very, very long. He treats the Buddha as a super-human being within time.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi argues for **Absolute Eternity (*Chángzhù*)**. The Buddha's life span is the **Dharmakaya** itself. It has no beginning and no end. To say it is 'finite' is to fall back into the 'Provisional' view. Zhiyi’s 'Opening the Trace to Reveal the Origin' means realizing that the Buddha *is* the life of the universe.

### 2. On the Physician's Death
*   **Fayun's View:** The Buddha pretends to die to make people value the Dharma.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi uses the **'Non-Duality of Life and Death'**. The Buddha is always present on **Gridhrakuta Mountain** (Spirit Vulture Peak). His 'death' is an illusion for those with 'blurred vision' (*yǎn yì*). The 'Medicine' is the realization that the Father never left.

### 3. On the Three Times (Past, Present, Future)
*   **Fayun's View:** Chronological stages of the Buddha's career.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi collapses the Three Times into the **Single Thought**. The past enlightenment, the present teaching, and the future Nirvana are all contained in the **Three Thousand Realms in a Single Thought**.
