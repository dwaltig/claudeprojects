# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 8: Eternity vs. Infinity (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"This is the doctrinal climax of the Lotus Sutra. Fayun’s 'Long but Finite' view was the standard interpretation of the time. But Master Zhiyi saw this as a profound misunderstanding of the Buddha's nature."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the Life Span
*   **Fayun's View:** The Buddha's life is finite. It’s just very, very long. He treats the Buddha as a super-human being within time.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi argues for **Absolute Eternity (*Chángzhù*)**. The Buddha's life span is the **Dharmakaya** itself. It has no beginning and no end. To say it is 'finite' is to fall back into the 'Provisional' view. Zhiyi’s 'Opening the Trace to Reveal the Origin' means realizing that the Buddha *is* the life of the universe.

### 2. On the Physician's Death
*   **Fayun's View:** The Buddha pretends to die to make people value the Dharma.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi uses the **'Non-Duality of Life and Death'**. The Buddha is always present on **Gridhrakuta Mountain** (Spirit Vulture Peak). His 'death' is an illusion for those with 'blurred vision' (*yǎn yì*). The 'Medicine' is the realization that the Father never left.

### 3. On the Three Times (Past, Present, Future)
*   **Fayun's View:** Chronological stages of the Buddha's career.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi collapses the Three Times into the **Single Thought**. The past enlightenment, the present teaching, and the future Nirvana are all contained in the **Three Thousand Realms in a Single Thought**.
# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 8: The Roots of the Eternal (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun treats the Earth Bodhisattvas as 'Old Friends' from the past. But Tiantai sees them as the **Primary Subject of the Eternal Buddha**."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the Earth Bodhisattvas
*   **Fayun's View:** Disciples from the distant past.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi argues that these Bodhisattvas are the **Eternal Retinue**. They are always present, always teaching, always enlightening. Their emergence 'cracks open' the view of the recent Buddha (Shakyamuni) to reveal the Eternal Buddha. The 'Earth' they come from is the **Ground of Ultimate Reality**.

### 2. On the Merit of the 50th Person
*   **Fayun's View:** A quantitative comparison. 1 > 50 > Charity.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi sees this as the **'Transfer of the Essence'**. The merit doesn't dilute as it passes down the line. The 50th person receives the *same* Buddha-seed as the 1st. It proves that the nature of the Lotus Sutra is **Holographic**—the whole is present in every part.

### 3. On the Transmission
*   **Fayun's View:** A series of encouraging stories.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi sees the final chapters as the **'Function of the Origin' (*Běn Yòng*)**. The Bodhisattvas (Avalokiteshvara, etc.) are the hands and eyes of the Eternal Buddha reaching into the world. They are not just models; they are the **Living Activity of the Lotus** in the phenomenal world.
