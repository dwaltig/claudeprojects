# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 1: The Pre-Tiantai Benchmark (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun’s commentary was the 'Gold Standard' of his time. He was the first to really nail down the logic of why the Lotus Sutra is 'Subtle' by comparing it to previous teachings. But when Master Zhiyi got hold of this, he felt Fayun hadn't gone deep enough."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On 'Subtle' (Miao)
*   **Fayun's View:** 'Subtle' means 'superior to the coarse.' It’s a relative comparison (*Xiāngdài Miào*).
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi argues that if 'Subtle' only exists in comparison to 'Coarse,' it’s still trapped in duality. Zhiyi introduces the **'Absolute Subtlety' (*Juéduì Miào*)**, where the Coarse *is* the Subtle. He expands Fayun's 3 meanings into **30 meanings** (10 for the Traces, 10 for the Origin, 10 for the Mind).

### 2. On the Lotus Metaphor
*   **Fayun's View:** The Lotus represents the 'simultaneity of Cause and Fruit' (the flower and the seed pod appearing at once).
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi finds this too simple. He develops the **Three Pairs of Metaphors** for the Lotus:
    1.  *Flower for the sake of Fruit:* Providing the Trace to reveal the Origin.
    2.  *Flower opening to reveal Fruit:* Stripping the Trace to show the Origin.
    3.  *Flower falling and Fruit remaining:* Discarding the Trace once the Origin is established.
    Fayun only sees the 'simultaneity,' while Zhiyi sees the 'evolution' of the teaching.

### 3. The 'Four Vehicles' Trap
*   **Fayun's View:** Famous for the 'Four Vehicles' (Sheep, Deer, Ox carts = 3; Great White Ox cart = 4). He thinks the Buddha gives a *new, fourth* cart.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** This is the big one. Zhiyi argues that there is no 'Fourth' vehicle. The **Three Carts *are* the One Vehicle**. If the Buddha gives a fourth cart, it implies the first three were lies. For Zhiyi, the 'White Ox' is the realization that the previous three were always the One Vehicle in disguise.
