# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 2: Opening the Gate (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun’s 'Two Wisdoms' theory was revolutionary for the Liang Dynasty. He was the first to systematically explain how the Buddha’s mind handles the 'One' vs. the 'Many.' However, Zhiyi felt Fayun’s 'Ten Suchnesses' analysis was too rigid."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the Two Wisdoms
*   **Fayun's View:** Real Wisdom is for the Buddha's own realization; Expedient Wisdom is for saving others. They are like two separate tools.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi introduces **'The Non-Duality of the Two Wisdoms' (*Èr Zhì Bù Èr*)**. For Zhiyi, Expedient Wisdom *is* Real Wisdom in action. You can't have one without the other. He uses the metaphor of the **'Gem in the Robe'**—the wealth (Real) is always there, even when you're working for wages (Expedient).

### 2. On the Ten Suchnesses (The Famous Battle)
*   **Fayun's View:** He divides the ten into two halves (5 Provisional, 4 Real, 1 Synthesis).
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** This is one of Zhiyi's most famous rebuttals in the *Fahua Xuanyi*. Zhiyi argues that **each of the Ten Suchnesses is simultaneously Empty, Provisional, and Middle**. You can't say the first five are just 'provisional.' Appearance *is* Reality. This leads to the Tiantai doctrine of **'The Threefold Truth in a Single Thought' (*Yīniàn Sānqiān*)**, which completely replaces Fayun's binary division.

### 3. On 'One Principle' (Li Yi)
*   **Fayun's View:** The goal is the 'One Principle' of Emptiness.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Fayun’s 'One Principle' is still too close to the 'Analytical Emptiness' of the Hinayana. Zhiyi proposes the **'Middle Way'** which includes both Emptiness and the wonderful existence of the world.

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun’s explanation of the 5,000 departures is very logical. He sees it as a pragmatic 'sorting' of the audience. But Tiantai sees this moment as a **Cosmic Revelation of Capacity**."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the 'Three Requests'
*   **Fayun's View:** A psychological tool to make people want the teaching more.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi sees the three requests as representing the **Three Wisdoms** (Sariputra requests with the wisdom of the 'One,' the 'Provisional,' and the 'Middle'). The Buddha’s refusals represent the **Three Secret Intentions** of the Buddha. It’s a formal 'Dharma Combat' that establishes the authority of the One Vehicle.

### 2. On the 5,000 Departures
*   **Fayun's View:** They were 'Arrogant' (*Zēngshàngmàn*) and couldn't handle the truth. Better they leave.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi adds a terrifying layer. He argues that these 5,000 were **'Rootless' (*Wú Gēn*)** in *this* life, but the Buddha's silence was a **Secret Seed**. By allowing them to leave, the Buddha actually planted the 'Lotus Seed' in their sub-consciousness. They will wander for eons, but because they *saw* the Buddha enter the Samadhi of the Lotus, they are already saved in the long run.

### 3. On 'Only Solid Trunks Remain'
*   **Fayun's View:** The group is now pure and high-quality.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi uses this to define **'Perfect Capacity' (*Yuán Jī*)**. The people who stayed aren't just 'good monks'; they are beings whose minds are perfectly aligned with the **Triple Truth**. They are the 'Solid Trunks' because they can support the weight of the Absolute Reality without breaking.
