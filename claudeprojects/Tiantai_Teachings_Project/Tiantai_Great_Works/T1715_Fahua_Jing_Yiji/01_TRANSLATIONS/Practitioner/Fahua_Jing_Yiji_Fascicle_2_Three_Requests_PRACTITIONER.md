# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 2/3: The Filter of the Dharma (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun’s explanation of the 5,000 departures is very logical. He sees it as a pragmatic 'sorting' of the audience. But Tiantai sees this moment as a **Cosmic Revelation of Capacity**."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On the 'Three Requests'
*   **Fayun's View:** A psychological tool to make people want the teaching more.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi sees the three requests as representing the **Three Wisdoms** (Sariputra requests with the wisdom of the 'One,' the 'Provisional,' and the 'Middle'). The Buddha’s refusals represent the **Three Secret Intentions** of the Buddha. It’s a formal 'Dharma Combat' that establishes the authority of the One Vehicle.

### 2. On the 5,000 Departures
*   **Fayun's View:** They were 'Arrogant' (*Zēngshàngmàn*) and couldn't handle the truth. Better they leave.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi adds a terrifying layer. He argues that these 5,000 were **'Rootless' (*Wú Gēn*)** in *this* life, but the Buddha's silence was a **Secret Seed**. By allowing them to leave, the Buddha actually planted the 'Lotus Seed' in their sub-consciousness. They will wander for eons, but because they *saw* the Buddha enter the Samadhi of the Lotus, they are already saved in the long run.

### 3. On 'Only Solid Trunks Remain'
*   **Fayun's View:** The group is now pure and high-quality.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi uses this to define **'Perfect Capacity' (*Yuán Jī*)**. The people who stayed aren't just 'good monks'; they are beings whose minds are perfectly aligned with the **Triple Truth**. They are the 'Solid Trunks' because they can support the weight of the Absolute Reality without breaking.
