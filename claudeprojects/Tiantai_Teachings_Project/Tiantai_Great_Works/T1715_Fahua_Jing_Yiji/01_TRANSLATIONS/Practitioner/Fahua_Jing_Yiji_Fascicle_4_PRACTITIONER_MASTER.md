# Fahua Jing Yiji - Fascicle 4: The Wages of Nirvana (The Critic)

## The Tiantai Critic's Review
"Fayun’s alignment of the 'Poor Son' stages with the Five Periods of teaching (especially the *Prajna* connection) is brilliant and was largely adopted by later schools. However, his view of the 'Dung' and the 'Wages' is where Tiantai adds its own flavor."

## ⚖️ The Tiantai Critique

### 1. On 'Clearing Dung' (*Chú Fèn*)
*   **Fayun's View:** Dung represents the gross afflictions of the Three Realms. 'Clearing' it is the Hinayana practice of Arhatship.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi agrees but adds the **'Dung of Views' (*Jiàn Fèn*)**. He argues that even the attachment to Arhatship itself is a form of 'dung' that needs to be cleared before the One Vehicle inheritance can be accepted.

### 2. On the 'Accounts' (*Cáiwù*)
*   **Fayun's View:** Managing the accounts is the *Prajna* period where Arhats taught Mahayana to others.
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi calls this **'Secret Influence' (*An Zhù*)**. The Buddha was 'tricking' the Arhats into becoming Bodhisattvas without them knowing it. By making them handle the 'wealth' (the logic of Emptiness), he was secretly expanding their capacity until it could match his own.

### 3. On the 'Sick Father' (*Zhǎngzhě Yǒu Jí*)
*   **Fayun's View:** The Father being 'sick and near death' represents the Buddha reaching the end of his physical life (approaching the *Nirvana Sutra*).
*   **Zhiyi's Critique:** Zhiyi interprets 'Sickness' as the **Buddha's Compassion**. The Buddha is 'sick' because sentient beings are sick. The 'Near Death' is the final stage of **Skillful Means** where the provisional forms must die so the Eternal Buddha can be revealed.
