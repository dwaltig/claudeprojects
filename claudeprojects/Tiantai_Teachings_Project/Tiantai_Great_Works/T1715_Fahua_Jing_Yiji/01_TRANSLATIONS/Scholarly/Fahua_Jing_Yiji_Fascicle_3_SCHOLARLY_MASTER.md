"**1. The Method of the Three Capacities (*Sān Gēn*):**
Fayun explains that the Buddha’s strategy for 'Opening the Three and Revealing the One' is divided into three distinct stages to match the three levels of human capacity:
1.  **Dharma-Explanation (*Fǎ Shuō*):** For those of high capacity (like Sariputra). They understand the principle immediately upon hearing the logic.
2.  **Parable-Explanation (*Pìyù Shuō*):** For those of middle capacity (like Kashyapa). They require metaphors (like the Burning House) to grasp the meaning.
3.  **Causal-Precedent Explanation (*Yīnyuán Shuō*):** For those of low capacity (like Purna). They need to hear about their past-life connections to the Buddha (like the Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Buddha) to find faith.

**2. The Four Unities (*Sì Yī*):**
In this 'Dharma-Explanation' stage, Fayun identifies four specific 'Unities' that the Buddha reveals to collapse the Three Vehicles into the One:
1.  **Unity of Teaching (*Jiào Yī*):** All different sutras ultimately point to one message.
2.  **Unity of Person (*Rén Yī*):** There is no 'Arhat' vs 'Bodhisattva'; all are simply 'Buddha-Sons.'
3.  **Unity of Cause (*Yīn Yī*):** All practices (even small ones like giving a flower) are causes for Buddhahood.
4.  **Unity of Fruit (*Guǒ Yī*):** There is only one final result: the 'All-Knowledge' (*Sarvajna*) of a Buddha."

"**1. The Ten Metaphors of the Burning House (*Shí Pì*):**
Fayun breaks the Parable of the Burning House into ten distinct sub-metaphors, meticulously mapping each to the Buddha's pedagogical process:
1.  **The Householder:** The Buddha as the universal father.
2.  **The Fire:** The 'Five Turbidities' and 'Eight Sufferings' consuming the world.
3.  **Failure to Save via the Great Vehicle:** The Buddha's initial attempt to teach the One Vehicle, which the children (sentient beings) could not understand.
4.  **Saving via the Three Carts:** The Buddha's use of the Sheep, Deer, and Ox carts (Three Vehicles) to entice the children out.
5.  **Escape from Danger:** Attaining Arhatship/Pratyekabuddhahood (escaping the Three Realms).
6.  **The Father's Joy:** The Buddha's fulfillment in seeing beings safe.
7.  **Requesting the Carts (*Suǒ Chē*):** The beings ask for the Sheep, Deer, and Ox carts they were promised.
8.  **Granting the Great Cart (*Cì Dàchē*):** Instead of the small carts, the Father gives them all the **Great White Ox Cart**.
9.  **Receiving the Unexpected:** The joy of the disciples upon receiving the One Vehicle.
10. **Non-Falsehood:** Proving the Buddha did not lie by promising small and giving large.

**2. The Four Vehicles Doctrine (*Sì Shèng Shuō*):**
Fayun’s most famous and controversial thesis is that the **Three Carts** (Sheep, Deer, Ox) mentioned at the gate are *different* from the **Great White Ox Cart** given at the end.
*   **The Three Carts:** Represent the literal Three Vehicles (Sravaka, Pratyekabuddha, Bodhisattva) of the provisional teachings.
*   **The Great White Ox Cart:** Represents a **Fourth Vehicle**—the Buddha Vehicle.
*   **The Logic:** Because the children 'request' the three but 'receive' the one, Fayun concludes the 'One Vehicle' is a distinct, superior fourth entity that replaces the three."
