"**1. The Nature of Prophecy (*Shòujì*):**
Fayun explains that 'Prophecy' involves two aspects:
1.  **The Granting (*Shòu*):** The Buddha's act of giving the prediction (The Teacher's side).
2.  **The Receiving (*Jì*):** The disciple's act of taking the assurance of future Buddhahood (The Student's side).
Prophecy is not just a 'fortune telling'; it is the formalizing of the 'One Vehicle' cause. It transforms the Arhat's mind into a Bodhisattva's mind by giving them a specific target (a future Buddha-name and land).

**2. The Parable of the Phantom City (*Huàchéng Pì*):**
Fayun breaks this down into five logical sub-metaphors:
1.  **The Guide:** The Buddha.
2.  **The Travelers:** Sentient beings seeking the Treasure.
3.  **The Difficult Path:** The 500 *yojanas* of the Three Realms and the secondary afflictions.
4.  **The Phantom City:** Nirvana as understood by the Sravakas. It is a 'conjured' city, a place to rest, not the final destination.
5.  **The Treasure Land:** The ultimate Buddhahood (One Vehicle).

**3. The '300 and 500' Logic:**
Fayun argues that the 300 *yojanas* represent the point where the Sravakas 'rest' in Arhatship (The Phantom City). The final 200 *yojanas* represent the distance from Arhatship to Buddhahood. The Phantom City is necessary because the travelers are 'exhausted' and 'terrified' by the long road. Without the rest stop, they would give up and turn back."

"**1. The Nature of the Life Span (*Shòuliàng*):**
Fayun explains that the Buddha’s life span is measured in 'dust and sand' (*chénshā*). He reveals that his attainment of Buddhahood was not a recent event under the Bodhi tree, but occurred eons ago.
*   **The Traces (*Jī*):** The Buddha appearing to be born in the palace and attaining enlightenment is a 'Trace.'
*   **The Origin (*Běn*):** The Buddha has actually been enlightened for an incalculable time. This is the 'Origin.'

**2. The Parable of the Physician (*Liángyī Pì*):**
Fayun breaks this parable down into four logical stages of the Buddha's work across the Three Times (Past, Present, Future):
1.  **The Past:** The Buddha as the Wise Physician who knows the medicine.
2.  **The Present:** The children (beings) drinking poison (delusion) and the Father returning to save them.
3.  **The Future:** The Father appearing to 'die' (Nirvana) to cure the children's lack of respect and make them seek the medicine themselves.
4.  **The Proof:** Showing that this 'death' is not a lie, but a supreme skillful means.

**3. The Finite Nature of Life:**
Fayun makes a controversial claim: Although the Buddha's life is 'immeasurably long' (*wúliàng*), it is still **Conditioned (*Yǒuwéi*)**. He argues that the Buddha’s life span, though it lasts for countless kalpas, will ultimately have an end point. It is 'eternity within time' rather than absolute eternity."
