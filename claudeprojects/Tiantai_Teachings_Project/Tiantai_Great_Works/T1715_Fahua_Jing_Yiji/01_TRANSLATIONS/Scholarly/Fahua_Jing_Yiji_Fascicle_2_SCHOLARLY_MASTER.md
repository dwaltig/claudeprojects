"**1. The Meaning of the Chapter Title 'Skillful Means' (*Fāngbiàn Pǐn*):**
This chapter should actually be called 'The Reality of All Dharmas' (*Shíxiàng Pǐn*), but it is named 'Skillful Means' to highlight the contrast. In the past, the Three Vehicle teachings were considered 'real.' Now, with the revelation of the One Vehicle, those past teachings are revealed to be 'Convenient Devices' (*Fāngbiàn*).
*   **The Metaphor of the Door:** A wooden door is closed, and one only sees the door. When the hand opens the door, one sees the golden statue inside. The 'Skillful Means' is the hand that opens the door; the 'Golden Statue' is the Real Truth of the One Vehicle.

**2. The Theory of the Two Wisdoms (*Èr Zhì*):**
The Buddha possesses two primary types of wisdom to save sentient beings:
1.  **Real Wisdom (*Shí Zhì*):** Also called 'Prajna' or 'Wisdom.' It is the internal, silent realization of the True Nature. It corresponds to the 'One Reality' (*Yī Shí*).
2.  **Expedient Wisdom (*Fāngbiàn Zhì*):** Also called 'Provisional Wisdom' (*Quán Zhì*). It is the 'skillful ability' to manifest various teachings according to the capacity of the audience.

**3. The Object of the Two Wisdoms:**
*   **Expedient Wisdom** contemplates the 'Three Realms' (Three Teachings, Three Capacities, Three Types of People). This is the 'Three-Three' realm.
*   **Real Wisdom** contemplates the 'Four Ones' (One Teaching, One Principle, One Capacity, One Person). This is the 'Four-One' realm.

**4. The 'Ten Suchnesses' (*Shí Rúshì*):**
Fayun breaks down the 'Ten Suchnesses' into two groups:
*   **The First Five (Appearance, Nature, Substance, Power, Function):** These represent the **Expedient** side—the differentiated characteristics of the Three Vehicles.
*   **The Last Four (Cause, Condition, Effect, Retribution):** These represent the **Real** side—the ultimate karmic chain leading to Buddhahood.
*   **The Tenth (Ultimate Equality):** This is the synthesis where both 'Provisional' and 'Real' are seen as ultimately the same."

## Source Text (Fascicle 3)
> 「爾時佛告舍利弗止止不須復說」... 「舍利弗重白佛言唯願說之」...
> 「佛復止舍利弗若說是事，一切世間諸天及人皆當驚疑」...
> 「說此語時會中有五千等禮佛而退... 世尊默然不止。」

"**1. The Three Requests and Two Refusals (*Sān Qǐng Liǎng Zhǐ*):**
The Buddha initially refuses to preach the Lotus Sutra three times to Sariputra. This is not because the Buddha is stingy with the Dharma, but for two critical reasons:
1.  **To Evoke Sincerity:** By refusing, the Buddha forces the audience to examine their own hearts and generate a profound 'thirst for the Dharma' (*shù kě*).
2.  **To Signal the Difficulty:** It shows that the Two Wisdoms (Real and Expedient) are subtle and not easily understood by commoners or even Hinayana saints.

**2. The Departure of the 5,000 (*Wǔqiān Tuìxí*):**
When the Buddha finally agrees to speak, 5,000 monks, nuns, and laypeople bow and leave the assembly.
*   **The Cause:** These are people of 'Overweening Pride' (*Zēngshàngmàn*). They believe they have already attained ultimate Nirvana and thus have no need for the One Vehicle.
*   **The Buddha's Silence:** Why did the Buddha not stop them? Because their 'roots of faith' were missing (*wú gēn*). To force them to stay and hear the 'One Vehicle' would only cause them to commit the sin of slander, leading them to the hells. His silence was an act of Great Compassion—allowing them to leave rather than suffer further karmic downfall.

**3. The Resulting Purity:**
After they leave, the Buddha tells Sariputra: 'This assembly is now free of branches and leaves; only the solid trunks remain.' This signifies that those who remain are the true 'Buddha-Sons' (*Fózǐ*) ready for the Real Truth."
