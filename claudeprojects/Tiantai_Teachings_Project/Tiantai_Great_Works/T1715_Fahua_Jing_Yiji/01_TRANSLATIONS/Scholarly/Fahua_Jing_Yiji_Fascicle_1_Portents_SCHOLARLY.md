## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. The Two Prefaces (*Èr Xù*):**
*   **The Common Preface (*Tōng Xù*):** From 'Thus have I heard' to 'sat to one side.' This is common to all Sutras, verifying the transmission.
*   **The Specific Preface (*Bié Xù*):** From 'At that time the World Honored One...' to the end of the Introduction. This is unique to the Lotus Sutra, setting the stage for the specific teaching.

**2. The Six Portents of this Earth (*Cǐ Tǔ Liù Ruì*):**
To reveal the 'One Vehicle,' the Buddha first displays six miraculous signs in this world:
1.  **Teaching the *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra* (*Wúliángyì Jīng*):** This serves as the 'roaming preface' (*Yóu Xù*) to the Lotus. It teaches that 'all dharmas flow from one source,' preparing the mind for the One Vehicle.
2.  **Entering the Samadhi of Immeasurable Meanings (*Rù Dìng*):** Silence before speech. The Buddha enters meditation to contemplate the 'Immeasurable Reality.'
3.  **Raining of Four Flowers (*Tiān Yǔ Sì Huā*):** Heaven rains Mandarava (white) and Manjushaka (red) flowers. This symbolizes the 'flowering' of the Cause before the Fruit.
4.  **Earth Shaking in Six Ways (*Dì Liù Zhòng Dòng*):** The earth shakes (east rises, west sinks, etc.). This symbolizes the breaking of the six rigid attachments of the Six Realms.
5.  **The Assembly Rejoicing (*Dàzhòng Huānxǐ*):** The hearts of the audience are gladdened, signaling their readiness to receive the Great Dharma.
6.  **Emitting the Light (*Fàng Guāng*):** The Buddha emits a ray of light from his white hair tuft (*Báiháo*), illuminating 18,000 worlds to the East. This is the 'Sign of Manifestation' (*Xiǎn Xiàng*).

**3. The Meaning of 'East':**
Why the East? The East is the direction of the rising sun, symbolizing the beginning of wisdom and the 'Origin' of the teaching. It represents the start of the 'Great Cause' (*Dà Yīn*)."
