## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. The Meaning of the Chapter Title 'Skillful Means' (*Fāngbiàn Pǐn*):**
This chapter should actually be called 'The Reality of All Dharmas' (*Shíxiàng Pǐn*), but it is named 'Skillful Means' to highlight the contrast. In the past, the Three Vehicle teachings were considered 'real.' Now, with the revelation of the One Vehicle, those past teachings are revealed to be 'Convenient Devices' (*Fāngbiàn*).
*   **The Metaphor of the Door:** A wooden door is closed, and one only sees the door. When the hand opens the door, one sees the golden statue inside. The 'Skillful Means' is the hand that opens the door; the 'Golden Statue' is the Real Truth of the One Vehicle.

**2. The Theory of the Two Wisdoms (*Èr Zhì*):**
The Buddha possesses two primary types of wisdom to save sentient beings:
1.  **Real Wisdom (*Shí Zhì*):** Also called 'Prajna' or 'Wisdom.' It is the internal, silent realization of the True Nature. It corresponds to the 'One Reality' (*Yī Shí*).
2.  **Expedient Wisdom (*Fāngbiàn Zhì*):** Also called 'Provisional Wisdom' (*Quán Zhì*). It is the 'skillful ability' to manifest various teachings according to the capacity of the audience.

**3. The Object of the Two Wisdoms:**
*   **Expedient Wisdom** contemplates the 'Three Realms' (Three Teachings, Three Capacities, Three Types of People). This is the 'Three-Three' realm.
*   **Real Wisdom** contemplates the 'Four Ones' (One Teaching, One Principle, One Capacity, One Person). This is the 'Four-One' realm.

**4. The 'Ten Suchnesses' (*Shí Rúshì*):**
Fayun breaks down the 'Ten Suchnesses' into two groups:
*   **The First Five (Appearance, Nature, Substance, Power, Function):** These represent the **Expedient** side—the differentiated characteristics of the Three Vehicles.
*   **The Last Four (Cause, Condition, Effect, Retribution):** These represent the **Real** side—the ultimate karmic chain leading to Buddhahood.
*   **The Tenth (Ultimate Equality):** This is the synthesis where both 'Provisional' and 'Real' are seen as ultimately the same."
