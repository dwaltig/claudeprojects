## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. The Bodhisattvas from the Earth (*Cóng Dì Yǒng Chū*):**
Fayun explains the significance of these countless Bodhisattvas rising from the earth:
*   **The Original Disciples:** These are the disciples the Buddha taught in his **Original Land** (*Běn Tǔ*) countless eons ago. They are not his 'Trace' disciples (like Sariputra); they are his 'Family.'
*   **Why from Beneath?** Because they dwell in the Space of Reality (*Empty Space* beneath the world), untouched by worldly affairs.
*   **The Four Leaders:** Superior Conduct, Boundless Conduct, Pure Conduct, Steadfast Conduct. These represent the **Four Virtues of Nirvana** (Permanence, Bliss, Self, Purity) in their causal stage.

**2. The Distinction of Merit (*Fēnbié Gōngdé*):**
Fayun categorizes the merit of hearing the Lotus Sutra into specific grades:
*   **The 12 Grades of Hearing:** From merely rejoicing (lowest) to fully understanding and practicing (highest).
*   **The 50th Person:** Even the 50th person to hear a single verse of the Lotus Sutra has more merit than a person who gives charity to the whole world for 80 years. Why? because material charity is finite; the Dharma-seed is infinite.

**3. The Circulation of the Sutra (*Liútōng Fēn*):**
Fayun groups the final chapters (17-28) into the 'Circulation Division.' He identifies two modes of propagation:
1.  **Transmission by Merit:** (Chapters 17-20) Encouraging people to spread the Sutra by promising vast rewards (Six Sense Purification).
2.  **Transmission by Example:** (Chapters 21-28) Using the stories of great Bodhisattvas (Medicine King, Wonderful Sound, Avalokiteshvara) as models for how to protect and spread the text in evil times.
    *   *Medicine King:* Self-sacrifice for the Dharma.
    *   *Avalokiteshvara:* Universal salvation through skill in means.
    *   *Samantabhadra:* The final protector who ensures the text survives the Later Day of the Law."
