## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. The Method of the Three Capacities (*Sān Gēn*):**
Fayun explains that the Buddha’s strategy for 'Opening the Three and Revealing the One' is divided into three distinct stages to match the three levels of human capacity:
1.  **Dharma-Explanation (*Fǎ Shuō*):** For those of high capacity (like Sariputra). They understand the principle immediately upon hearing the logic.
2.  **Parable-Explanation (*Pìyù Shuō*):** For those of middle capacity (like Kashyapa). They require metaphors (like the Burning House) to grasp the meaning.
3.  **Causal-Precedent Explanation (*Yīnyuán Shuō*):** For those of low capacity (like Purna). They need to hear about their past-life connections to the Buddha (like the Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Buddha) to find faith.

**2. The Four Unities (*Sì Yī*):**
In this 'Dharma-Explanation' stage, Fayun identifies four specific 'Unities' that the Buddha reveals to collapse the Three Vehicles into the One:
1.  **Unity of Teaching (*Jiào Yī*):** All different sutras ultimately point to one message.
2.  **Unity of Person (*Rén Yī*):** There is no 'Arhat' vs 'Bodhisattva'; all are simply 'Buddha-Sons.'
3.  **Unity of Cause (*Yīn Yī*):** All practices (even small ones like giving a flower) are causes for Buddhahood.
4.  **Unity of Fruit (*Guǒ Yī*):** There is only one final result: the 'All-Knowledge' (*Sarvajna*) of a Buddha."
