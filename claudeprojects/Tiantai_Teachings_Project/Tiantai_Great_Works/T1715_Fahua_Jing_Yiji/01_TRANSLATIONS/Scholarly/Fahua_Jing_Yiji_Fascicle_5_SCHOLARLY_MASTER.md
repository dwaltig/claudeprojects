## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. The Metaphor of One Rain, Many Capacities:**
The Buddha’s teaching is like a single great cloud that covers the entire world and rains equally on all. However, because the plants (sentient beings) have different roots, stems, and natures, they absorb the water differently and grow to different heights.

**2. The Three Grasses and Two Trees (*Sān Cǎo Èr Mù*):**
Fayun classifies sentient beings into five distinct categories based on this parable:
*   **The Small Grass (*Xiǎo Cǎo*):** Represents those in the **Human and Heavenly Vehicles**. They seek better rebirths but do not yet understand liberation.
*   **The Middle Grass (*Zhōng Cǎo*):** Represents the **Sravakas and Pratyekabuddhas** (Two Vehicles). They seek personal Nirvana and have 'middle' capacity.
*   **The Large Grass (*Shàng Cǎo*):** Represents **Bodhisattvas of the Three Vehicles**. They seek the Buddha-path but still operate within the provisional framework.
*   **The Small Tree (*Xiǎo Shù*):** Represents **Bodhisattvas of the 'Internal Ordinary' stage** (*Nèifán*). They have deep faith and a broader capacity than the 'grasses.'
*   **The Large Tree (*Dà Shù*):** Represents **Bodhisattvas of the First Ground (*Bhumi*) and above**. They are the giants of the forest, deeply rooted in the Real Truth.

**3. The Meaning of 'One Taste' (*Yī Wèi*):**
Though the growth is different, the rain has only one taste: the taste of **Liberation** and **Nirvana**. Fayun argues that while the Buddha sees the 'One Taste' (The Real), he provides the 'Many Rains' (The Provisional) because that is all the grasses can absorb."
