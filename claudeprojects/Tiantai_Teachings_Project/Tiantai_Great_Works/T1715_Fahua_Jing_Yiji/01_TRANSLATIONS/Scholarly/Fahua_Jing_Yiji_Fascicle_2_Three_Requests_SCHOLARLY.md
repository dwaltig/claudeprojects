## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. The Three Requests and Two Refusals (*Sān Qǐng Liǎng Zhǐ*):**
The Buddha initially refuses to preach the Lotus Sutra three times to Sariputra. This is not because the Buddha is stingy with the Dharma, but for two critical reasons:
1.  **To Evoke Sincerity:** By refusing, the Buddha forces the audience to examine their own hearts and generate a profound 'thirst for the Dharma' (*shù kě*).
2.  **To Signal the Difficulty:** It shows that the Two Wisdoms (Real and Expedient) are subtle and not easily understood by commoners or even Hinayana saints.

**2. The Departure of the 5,000 (*Wǔqiān Tuìxí*):**
When the Buddha finally agrees to speak, 5,000 monks, nuns, and laypeople bow and leave the assembly.
*   **The Cause:** These are people of 'Overweening Pride' (*Zēngshàngmàn*). They believe they have already attained ultimate Nirvana and thus have no need for the One Vehicle.
*   **The Buddha's Silence:** Why did the Buddha not stop them? Because their 'roots of faith' were missing (*wú gēn*). To force them to stay and hear the 'One Vehicle' would only cause them to commit the sin of slander, leading them to the hells. His silence was an act of Great Compassion—allowing them to leave rather than suffer further karmic downfall.

**3. The Resulting Purity:**
After they leave, the Buddha tells Sariputra: 'This assembly is now free of branches and leaves; only the solid trunks remain.' This signifies that those who remain are the true 'Buddha-Sons' (*Fózǐ*) ready for the Real Truth."
