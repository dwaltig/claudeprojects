## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. The Logic of Individual Prophecy:**
Fayun explains that the Prophecies (Chapters 6-9) are given sequentially to reflect the different 'shocks' required to wake up the different capacities of the Arhats.
*   **Mahakashyapa:** Receives his prophecy first because he is the eldest and most respected.
*   **Subhuti, Katyayana, Maudgalyayana:** Follow because they represent different facets of the 'Dung-clearing' life (Wisdom, Debate, Supernatural Powers).

**2. The Purpose of Naming:**
The Buddha gives each Arhat a future Buddha-name (e.g., Light Bright Buddha for Kashyapa). Fayun argues this is necessary because the Arhats previously believed their names would be extinguished in Nirvana. By giving them a future name, the Buddha is confirming their **Eternal Continuation** in the One Vehicle."

## 📜 Doctrinal Analysis (Guangzhai View)
*   **Gradual Acceptance:** Fayun sees the prophecies as a pedagogical process. The Buddha doesn't tell everyone at once; he waits for each group to 'ripen.'
*   **The Inherited Wealth:** This fascicle emphasizes that the Arhats are finally 'taking ownership' of the house they have been cleaning for decades.
