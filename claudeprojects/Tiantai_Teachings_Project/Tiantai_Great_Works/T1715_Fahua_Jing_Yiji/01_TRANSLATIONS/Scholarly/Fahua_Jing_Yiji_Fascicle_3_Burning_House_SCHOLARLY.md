## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. The Ten Metaphors of the Burning House (*Shí Pì*):**
Fayun breaks the Parable of the Burning House into ten distinct sub-metaphors, meticulously mapping each to the Buddha's pedagogical process:
1.  **The Householder:** The Buddha as the universal father.
2.  **The Fire:** The 'Five Turbidities' and 'Eight Sufferings' consuming the world.
3.  **Failure to Save via the Great Vehicle:** The Buddha's initial attempt to teach the One Vehicle, which the children (sentient beings) could not understand.
4.  **Saving via the Three Carts:** The Buddha's use of the Sheep, Deer, and Ox carts (Three Vehicles) to entice the children out.
5.  **Escape from Danger:** Attaining Arhatship/Pratyekabuddhahood (escaping the Three Realms).
6.  **The Father's Joy:** The Buddha's fulfillment in seeing beings safe.
7.  **Requesting the Carts (*Suǒ Chē*):** The beings ask for the Sheep, Deer, and Ox carts they were promised.
8.  **Granting the Great Cart (*Cì Dàchē*):** Instead of the small carts, the Father gives them all the **Great White Ox Cart**.
9.  **Receiving the Unexpected:** The joy of the disciples upon receiving the One Vehicle.
10. **Non-Falsehood:** Proving the Buddha did not lie by promising small and giving large.

**2. The Four Vehicles Doctrine (*Sì Shèng Shuō*):**
Fayun’s most famous and controversial thesis is that the **Three Carts** (Sheep, Deer, Ox) mentioned at the gate are *different* from the **Great White Ox Cart** given at the end.
*   **The Three Carts:** Represent the literal Three Vehicles (Sravaka, Pratyekabuddha, Bodhisattva) of the provisional teachings.
*   **The Great White Ox Cart:** Represents a **Fourth Vehicle**—the Buddha Vehicle.
*   **The Logic:** Because the children 'request' the three but 'receive' the one, Fayun concludes the 'One Vehicle' is a distinct, superior fourth entity that replaces the three."
