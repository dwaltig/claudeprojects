## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. Defining 'Subtle Dharma' (*Miàofǎ*):**
The term 'Subtle' (*Miào*) refers to that which is extraordinary and transcends the 'coarse' (*cū*). In terms of the Dharma, it speaks of both Cause and Fruit.
In former days, the Buddha taught the Six Paramitas as the Cause, resulting in two kinds of fruit (Conditioned and Unconditioned). However, those were not the ultimate beauty; they were 'coarse.' Today, the Cause encompasses all ten thousand virtues as the 'Single Road of Return' (*Tóngguī zhī lù*). The Fruit is the 'Ultimate Fruit,' which is double the number of previous reckonings.

**2. Defining 'Lotus' (*Liánhuā*):**
The Lotus is an external metaphor. In nature, a plant must have both flower and fruit together. To speak of the Lotus's flower is like the Cause of the Fruit-family; to speak of the flower's Lotus is like the Fruit of the Cause-family. Because this Sutra demonstrates the simultaneity of the One-Vehicle Cause and Fruit, it borrows this metaphor and is named 'Lotus.'

**3. The Three Meanings of Subtlety (*Miào*):**
The 'Subtle' of today is contrasted with the 'Coarse' of the past through three specific criteria:
1.  **Length of Substance (*Tǐ cháng*):** The Cause of the past was short, only covering the Three Realms. The Cause of today is long, extending from the first aspiration to the 'Diamond Mind,' covering both inside and outside the Three Realms.
2.  **Breadth of Meaning (*Yì guǎng*):** The Cause of the past was narrow, only mentioning the Six Paramitas. Today’s Cause is broad, encompassing every virtue encountered.
3.  **Superiority of Function (*Yòng shèng*):** The past Cause only severed the 'Four Dwellings' of affliction. Today’s Cause is superior, severing the 'Dwellings of Ignorance' (*Wúmíng zhùdì*) as well."

## 📜 Doctrinal Analysis (Guangzhai View)
*   **Four Vehicles:** The "Three Vehicles" are distinct from the "One Vehicle" (the fourth). The Buddha's previous teachings were provisional (coarse), and only now is he revealing the true, distinct Fourth Vehicle.
*   **Impermanence of the Buddha:** Fayun interprets the "Eternal" life span as just "very long," whereas Tiantai argues for true literal Eternity.

## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. The Five Common Prefaces (*Tōng Xù*):**
*   **'Thus':** Indicates the entire Sutra is what was heard.
*   **'I Heard':** Indicates Ananda is transmitting the words, not creating them.
*   **'At One Time':** Indicates the correspondence of the teaching with the capacity of the audience.
*   **'Buddha Dwells...':** Indicates the place (Gridhrakuta), verifying the 'I heard' is not false.
*   **'With the Great Bhikshu Assembly':** Lists the audience to prove the 'One Time' (correspondence).

**2. The Assembly Breakdown:**
*   **The 12,000 Arhats:** Why are they listed first? Because they are the 'Inner Kind' (*Nèizhòng*), constantly accompanying the Buddha.
*   **The Bodhisattvas (80,000):** Why listed second? Because they travel the ten directions to save beings and are not always at the Buddha's side ('Outer Kind').
*   **The Difference:** The Arhats have 'Small Names' (known locally); the Bodhisattvas have 'Great Names' (known universally).

**3. Defining 'Arhat' (*Luóhàn*):**
The term Arhat has three meanings, corresponding to the three meanings of 'Bhikshu':
1.  **Slayer of Thieves (*Shā Zéi*):** Killing the thieves of affliction (corresponds to Bhikshu as 'Destroyer of Evil').
2.  **Non-Birth (*Bù Shēng*):** No longer being reborn in the Three Realms (corresponds to Bhikshu as 'Frightener of Mara').
3.  **Worthy of Offerings (*Yìng Gòng*):** Worthy of receiving gifts from humans and gods (corresponds to Bhikshu as 'Mendicant')."

## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. The Two Prefaces (*Èr Xù*):**
*   **The Common Preface (*Tōng Xù*):** From 'Thus have I heard' to 'sat to one side.' This is common to all Sutras, verifying the transmission.
*   **The Specific Preface (*Bié Xù*):** From 'At that time the World Honored One...' to the end of the Introduction. This is unique to the Lotus Sutra, setting the stage for the specific teaching.

**2. The Six Portents of this Earth (*Cǐ Tǔ Liù Ruì*):**
To reveal the 'One Vehicle,' the Buddha first displays six miraculous signs in this world:
1.  **Teaching the *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra* (*Wúliángyì Jīng*):** This serves as the 'roaming preface' (*Yóu Xù*) to the Lotus. It teaches that 'all dharmas flow from one source,' preparing the mind for the One Vehicle.
2.  **Entering the Samadhi of Immeasurable Meanings (*Rù Dìng*):** Silence before speech. The Buddha enters meditation to contemplate the 'Immeasurable Reality.'
3.  **Raining of Four Flowers (*Tiān Yǔ Sì Huā*):** Heaven rains Mandarava (white) and Manjushaka (red) flowers. This symbolizes the 'flowering' of the Cause before the Fruit.
4.  **Earth Shaking in Six Ways (*Dì Liù Zhòng Dòng*):** The earth shakes (east rises, west sinks, etc.). This symbolizes the breaking of the six rigid attachments of the Six Realms.
5.  **The Assembly Rejoicing (*Dàzhòng Huānxǐ*):** The hearts of the audience are gladdened, signaling their readiness to receive the Great Dharma.
6.  **Emitting the Light (*Fàng Guāng*):** The Buddha emits a ray of light from his white hair tuft (*Báiháo*), illuminating 18,000 worlds to the East. This is the 'Sign of Manifestation' (*Xiǎn Xiàng*).

**3. The Meaning of 'East':**
Why the East? The East is the direction of the rising sun, symbolizing the beginning of wisdom and the 'Origin' of the teaching. It represents the start of the 'Great Cause' (*Dà Yīn*)."

## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. Maitreya's Three Thoughts (*Mílé Sān Niàn*):**
When the Buddha emitted the light, Maitreya Bodhisattva had three distinct thoughts:
1.  **The Thought of Surprise:** 'Why is there this瑞 (ruì - portent)?' (Wondering about the cause).
2.  **The Thought of Inquiry:** 'Who should I ask?' (Wondering about the person).
3.  **The Thought of Resolution:** 'Manjushri has been close to many Buddhas; he must know.' (Resolving to ask Manjushri).

**2. The Four Stages of Manjushri's Answer:**
Manjushri does not answer immediately with a simple 'Yes.' He builds a logical case using four stages:
1.  **Reflecting (*Sīwéi*):** 'I suspect the Buddha wishes to speak the Great Dharma.' (A tentative hypothesis).
2.  **Citing the Past (*Yǐn Gǔ*):** 'I have seen this before.' (Establishing a precedent).
3.  **Broad Evidence (*Guǎng Yǐn*):** 'In the past, the Buddha Sun-Moon-Lamp (*Rìyuèdēngmíng*) did this...' (Detailed historical proof).
4.  **Concluding (*Jié Dá*):** 'Therefore, I know that today is the same as the past.' (Final judgment).

**3. The Ancient Precedent (Sun-Moon-Lamp Buddha):**
Manjushri recalls the Buddha **Sun-Moon-Lamp** (*Candrasūryapradīpa*).
*   **The Sign:** He preached the *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra*, entered Samadhi, and the earth shook.
*   **The Teaching:** He then preached the *Lotus Sutra* for **60 small kalpas**.
*   **The Transmission:** After his Nirvana, the Bodhisattva **Fine Light** (*Varaprabha*) maintained the Sutra.
*   **The Connection:** Fine Light was **Manjushri** himself; the lazy student **Seeker of Fame** (*Yaśaskāma*) was **Maitreya**. This proves that Manjushri is qualified to answer and Maitreya is the one to ask."

## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. The Meaning of the Chapter Title 'Skillful Means' (*Fāngbiàn Pǐn*):**
This chapter should actually be called 'The Reality of All Dharmas' (*Shíxiàng Pǐn*), but it is named 'Skillful Means' to highlight the contrast. In the past, the Three Vehicle teachings were considered 'real.' Now, with the revelation of the One Vehicle, those past teachings are revealed to be 'Convenient Devices' (*Fāngbiàn*).
*   **The Metaphor of the Door:** A wooden door is closed, and one only sees the door. When the hand opens the door, one sees the golden statue inside. The 'Skillful Means' is the hand that opens the door; the 'Golden Statue' is the Real Truth of the One Vehicle.

**2. The Theory of the Two Wisdoms (*Èr Zhì*):**
The Buddha possesses two primary types of wisdom to save sentient beings:
1.  **Real Wisdom (*Shí Zhì*):** Also called 'Prajna' or 'Wisdom.' It is the internal, silent realization of the True Nature. It corresponds to the 'One Reality' (*Yī Shí*).
2.  **Expedient Wisdom (*Fāngbiàn Zhì*):** Also called 'Provisional Wisdom' (*Quán Zhì*). It is the 'skillful ability' to manifest various teachings according to the capacity of the audience.

**3. The Object of the Two Wisdoms:**
*   **Expedient Wisdom** contemplates the 'Three Realms' (Three Teachings, Three Capacities, Three Types of People). This is the 'Three-Three' realm.
*   **Real Wisdom** contemplates the 'Four Ones' (One Teaching, One Principle, One Capacity, One Person). This is the 'Four-One' realm.

**4. The 'Ten Suchnesses' (*Shí Rúshì*):**
Fayun breaks down the 'Ten Suchnesses' into two groups:
*   **The First Five (Appearance, Nature, Substance, Power, Function):** These represent the **Expedient** side—the differentiated characteristics of the Three Vehicles.
*   **The Last Four (Cause, Condition, Effect, Retribution):** These represent the **Real** side—the ultimate karmic chain leading to Buddhahood.
*   **The Tenth (Ultimate Equality):** This is the synthesis where both 'Provisional' and 'Real' are seen as ultimately the same."

## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. The Three Requests and Two Refusals (*Sān Qǐng Liǎng Zhǐ*):**
The Buddha initially refuses to preach the Lotus Sutra three times to Sariputra. This is not because the Buddha is stingy with the Dharma, but for two critical reasons:
1.  **To Evoke Sincerity:** By refusing, the Buddha forces the audience to examine their own hearts and generate a profound 'thirst for the Dharma' (*shù kě*).
2.  **To Signal the Difficulty:** It shows that the Two Wisdoms (Real and Expedient) are subtle and not easily understood by commoners or even Hinayana saints.

**2. The Departure of the 5,000 (*Wǔqiān Tuìxí*):**
When the Buddha finally agrees to speak, 5,000 monks, nuns, and laypeople bow and leave the assembly.
*   **The Cause:** These are people of 'Overweening Pride' (*Zēngshàngmàn*). They believe they have already attained ultimate Nirvana and thus have no need for the One Vehicle.
*   **The Buddha's Silence:** Why did the Buddha not stop them? Because their 'roots of faith' were missing (*wú gēn*). To force them to stay and hear the 'One Vehicle' would only cause them to commit the sin of slander, leading them to the hells. His silence was an act of Great Compassion—allowing them to leave rather than suffer further karmic downfall.

**3. The Resulting Purity:**
After they leave, the Buddha tells Sariputra: 'This assembly is now free of branches and leaves; only the solid trunks remain.' This signifies that those who remain are the true 'Buddha-Sons' (*Fózǐ*) ready for the Real Truth."

## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. The Method of the Three Capacities (*Sān Gēn*):**
Fayun explains that the Buddha’s strategy for 'Opening the Three and Revealing the One' is divided into three distinct stages to match the three levels of human capacity:
1.  **Dharma-Explanation (*Fǎ Shuō*):** For those of high capacity (like Sariputra). They understand the principle immediately upon hearing the logic.
2.  **Parable-Explanation (*Pìyù Shuō*):** For those of middle capacity (like Kashyapa). They require metaphors (like the Burning House) to grasp the meaning.
3.  **Causal-Precedent Explanation (*Yīnyuán Shuō*):** For those of low capacity (like Purna). They need to hear about their past-life connections to the Buddha (like the Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Buddha) to find faith.

**2. The Four Unities (*Sì Yī*):**
In this 'Dharma-Explanation' stage, Fayun identifies four specific 'Unities' that the Buddha reveals to collapse the Three Vehicles into the One:
1.  **Unity of Teaching (*Jiào Yī*):** All different sutras ultimately point to one message.
2.  **Unity of Person (*Rén Yī*):** There is no 'Arhat' vs 'Bodhisattva'; all are simply 'Buddha-Sons.'
3.  **Unity of Cause (*Yīn Yī*):** All practices (even small ones like giving a flower) are causes for Buddhahood.
4.  **Unity of Fruit (*Guǒ Yī*):** There is only one final result: the 'All-Knowledge' (*Sarvajna*) of a Buddha."

## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. The Ten Metaphors of the Burning House (*Shí Pì*):**
Fayun breaks the Parable of the Burning House into ten distinct sub-metaphors, meticulously mapping each to the Buddha's pedagogical process:
1.  **The Householder:** The Buddha as the universal father.
2.  **The Fire:** The 'Five Turbidities' and 'Eight Sufferings' consuming the world.
3.  **Failure to Save via the Great Vehicle:** The Buddha's initial attempt to teach the One Vehicle, which the children (sentient beings) could not understand.
4.  **Saving via the Three Carts:** The Buddha's use of the Sheep, Deer, and Ox carts (Three Vehicles) to entice the children out.
5.  **Escape from Danger:** Attaining Arhatship/Pratyekabuddhahood (escaping the Three Realms).
6.  **The Father's Joy:** The Buddha's fulfillment in seeing beings safe.
7.  **Requesting the Carts (*Suǒ Chē*):** The beings ask for the Sheep, Deer, and Ox carts they were promised.
8.  **Granting the Great Cart (*Cì Dàchē*):** Instead of the small carts, the Father gives them all the **Great White Ox Cart**.
9.  **Receiving the Unexpected:** The joy of the disciples upon receiving the One Vehicle.
10. **Non-Falsehood:** Proving the Buddha did not lie by promising small and giving large.

**2. The Four Vehicles Doctrine (*Sì Shèng Shuō*):**
Fayun’s most famous and controversial thesis is that the **Three Carts** (Sheep, Deer, Ox) mentioned at the gate are *different* from the **Great White Ox Cart** given at the end.
*   **The Three Carts:** Represent the literal Three Vehicles (Sravaka, Pratyekabuddha, Bodhisattva) of the provisional teachings.
*   **The Great White Ox Cart:** Represents a **Fourth Vehicle**—the Buddha Vehicle.
*   **The Logic:** Because the children 'request' the three but 'receive' the one, Fayun concludes the 'One Vehicle' is a distinct, superior fourth entity that replaces the three."

## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. The Nine Metaphors of the Poor Son (*Jiǔ Pì*):**
Fayun breaks the Parable of the Poor Son (Chapter 4) into nine stages, which he aligns with the history of the soul's relationship with the Buddha:
1.  **Separation of Father and Son:** The 'Original Loss' where the son (sentient being) wanders away from the Father (Buddha) into the Six Realms.
2.  **The Reunion (Seeing the Father):** The son accidentally encounters the Father but is terrified by his wealth and power.
3.  **Failure to Call the Son:** The Father's initial attempt to bring the son back via the Great Vehicle fails due to the son's fear.
4.  **Successful Recruitment:** The Father sends 'emissaries' (provisional teachings) to hire the son for menial labor (clearing dung).
5.  **Instruction in Labor:** The son works for 20 years, gradually becoming familiar with the household.
6.  **Entrusting the Wealth (*Fù Cáiwù*):** The Father puts the son in charge of the accounts (the *Prajnaparamita* teachings), but the son still does not claim ownership.
7.  **Growth of the Son's Ambition:** The son's mind gradually expands and becomes noble.
8.  **Granting the Inheritance:** The Father publicly declares the son as his heir and hands over the entire estate.
9.  **Rejoicing in the Inheritance:** The son finally realizes his true status as a Buddha-Son.

**2. The *Prajna* Connection:**
Fayun makes a critical historical link at stage 6. He argues that the Father 'putting the son in charge of accounts' represents the **Prajnaparamita Period**. In those sutras, the Sravakas (Arhats) were told to teach the Bodhisattva path to others, essentially 'managing' the Buddha's wealth, even though they themselves still believed they were 'dung-clearers' (Arhats) and not future Buddhas."

## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. The Metaphor of One Rain, Many Capacities:**
The Buddha’s teaching is like a single great cloud that covers the entire world and rains equally on all. However, because the plants (sentient beings) have different roots, stems, and natures, they absorb the water differently and grow to different heights.

**2. The Three Grasses and Two Trees (*Sān Cǎo Èr Mù*):**
Fayun classifies sentient beings into five distinct categories based on this parable:
*   **The Small Grass (*Xiǎo Cǎo*):** Represents those in the **Human and Heavenly Vehicles**. They seek better rebirths but do not yet understand liberation.
*   **The Middle Grass (*Zhōng Cǎo*):** Represents the **Sravakas and Pratyekabuddhas** (Two Vehicles). They seek personal Nirvana and have 'middle' capacity.
*   **The Large Grass (*Shàng Cǎo*):** Represents **Bodhisattvas of the Three Vehicles**. They seek the Buddha-path but still operate within the provisional framework.
*   **The Small Tree (*Xiǎo Shù*):** Represents **Bodhisattvas of the 'Internal Ordinary' stage** (*Nèifán*). They have deep faith and a broader capacity than the 'grasses.'
*   **The Large Tree (*Dà Shù*):** Represents **Bodhisattvas of the First Ground (*Bhumi*) and above**. They are the giants of the forest, deeply rooted in the Real Truth.

**3. The Meaning of 'One Taste' (*Yī Wèi*):**
Though the growth is different, the rain has only one taste: the taste of **Liberation** and **Nirvana**. Fayun argues that while the Buddha sees the 'One Taste' (The Real), he provides the 'Many Rains' (The Provisional) because that is all the grasses can absorb."

## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. The Logic of Individual Prophecy:**
Fayun explains that the Prophecies (Chapters 6-9) are given sequentially to reflect the different 'shocks' required to wake up the different capacities of the Arhats.
*   **Mahakashyapa:** Receives his prophecy first because he is the eldest and most respected.
*   **Subhuti, Katyayana, Maudgalyayana:** Follow because they represent different facets of the 'Dung-clearing' life (Wisdom, Debate, Supernatural Powers).

**2. The Purpose of Naming:**
The Buddha gives each Arhat a future Buddha-name (e.g., Light Bright Buddha for Kashyapa). Fayun argues this is necessary because the Arhats previously believed their names would be extinguished in Nirvana. By giving them a future name, the Buddha is confirming their **Eternal Continuation** in the One Vehicle."

---

## 📜 Doctrinal Analysis (Guangzhai View)
*   **Gradual Acceptance:** Fayun sees the prophecies as a pedagogical process. The Buddha doesn't tell everyone at once; he waits for each group to 'ripen.'
*   **The Inherited Wealth:** This fascicle emphasizes that the Arhats are finally 'taking ownership' of the house they have been cleaning for decades.

## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. The Nature of Prophecy (*Shòujì*):**
Fayun explains that 'Prophecy' involves two aspects:
1.  **The Granting (*Shòu*):** The Buddha's act of giving the prediction (The Teacher's side).
2.  **The Receiving (*Jì*):** The disciple's act of taking the assurance of future Buddhahood (The Student's side).
Prophecy is not just a 'fortune telling'; it is the formalizing of the 'One Vehicle' cause. It transforms the Arhat's mind into a Bodhisattva's mind by giving them a specific target (a future Buddha-name and land).

**2. The Parable of the Phantom City (*Huàchéng Pì*):**
Fayun breaks this down into five logical sub-metaphors:
1.  **The Guide:** The Buddha.
2.  **The Travelers:** Sentient beings seeking the Treasure.
3.  **The Difficult Path:** The 500 *yojanas* of the Three Realms and the secondary afflictions.
4.  **The Phantom City:** Nirvana as understood by the Sravakas. It is a 'conjured' city, a place to rest, not the final destination.
5.  **The Treasure Land:** The ultimate Buddhahood (One Vehicle).

**3. The '300 and 500' Logic:**
Fayun argues that the 300 *yojanas* represent the point where the Sravakas 'rest' in Arhatship (The Phantom City). The final 200 *yojanas* represent the distance from Arhatship to Buddhahood. The Phantom City is necessary because the travelers are 'exhausted' and 'terrified' by the long road. Without the rest stop, they would give up and turn back."

## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. The Prophecy for Ananda and Rahula:**
Fayun explains why these two specific disciples are singled out in Chapter 9:
*   **Ananda:** Represents those who are 'Learners' (*Xué*). He is the Keeper of the Dharma Storehouse. His prophecy ensures the transmission of the teaching.
*   **Rahula:** Represents the 'Non-Learners' (*Wú Xué* - in practice, though technically he might still be learning in some classifications, here he stands for the quiet practice). As the Buddha's biological son, his prophecy resolves the doubt that 'family connection' is a barrier to enlightenment.

**2. The Prophecy for the 2,000:**
The simultaneous prophecy for the 2,000 Learners and Non-Learners signifies the 'Universal Rain.' It shows that the One Vehicle is not just for the elite leaders (like Sariputra and Kashyapa) but for the mass of the Sangha. Fayun notes they all receive the same title: **Jewel Sign Tathagata** (*Baoxiang Rulai*), indicating the uniformity of their realization.

**3. The Jeweled Stupa (*Bǎo Tǎ*):**
Fayun divides the miraculous appearance of the Stupa into specific doctrinal functions:
1.  **Verification (*Zhèng Míng*):** The Stupa rises from the earth to verify the truth of the Lotus Sutra. The past Buddha (Many Jewels) comes to witness the present Buddha (Shakyamuni).
2.  **The Two Buddhas Seated Together:** When Shakyamuni opens the Stupa and sits next to Many Jewels, it symbolizes the **Non-Duality of the Trace and the Origin**.
    *   *Many Jewels:* Represents the Eternal Dharma Body (Origin).
    *   *Shakyamuni:* Represents the Manifested Response Body (Trace).
    *   *Sitting Together:* Shows that the Phenomenal and the Noumenal are one reality."

*   **The Traces (*Jī*):** The Buddha appearing to be born in the palace and attaining enlightenment is a 'Trace.'

**2. The Parable of the Physician (*Liángyī Pì*):**
Fayun breaks this parable down into four logical stages of the Buddha's work across the Three Times (Past, Present, Future):
1.  **The Past:** The Buddha as the Wise Physician who knows the medicine.
2.  **The Present:** The children (beings) drinking poison (delusion) and the Father returning to save them.
3.  **The Future:** The Father appearing to 'die' (Nirvana) to cure the children's lack of respect and make them seek the medicine themselves.
4.  **The Proof:** Showing that this 'death' is not a lie, but a supreme skillful means.

**3. The Finite Nature of Life:**
Fayun makes a controversial claim: Although the Buddha's life is 'immeasurably long' (*wúliàng*), it is still **Conditioned (*Yǒuwéi*)**. He argues that the Buddha’s life span, though it lasts for countless kalpas, will ultimately have an end point. It is 'eternity within time' rather than absolute eternity."

## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. The Bodhisattvas from the Earth (*Cóng Dì Yǒng Chū*):**
Fayun explains the significance of these countless Bodhisattvas rising from the earth:
*   **The Original Disciples:** These are the disciples the Buddha taught in his **Original Land** (*Běn Tǔ*) countless eons ago. They are not his 'Trace' disciples (like Sariputra); they are his 'Family.'
*   **Why from Beneath?** Because they dwell in the Space of Reality (*Empty Space* beneath the world), untouched by worldly affairs.
*   **The Four Leaders:** Superior Conduct, Boundless Conduct, Pure Conduct, Steadfast Conduct. These represent the **Four Virtues of Nirvana** (Permanence, Bliss, Self, Purity) in their causal stage.

**2. The Distinction of Merit (*Fēnbié Gōngdé*):**
Fayun categorizes the merit of hearing the Lotus Sutra into specific grades:
*   **The 12 Grades of Hearing:** From merely rejoicing (lowest) to fully understanding and practicing (highest).
*   **The 50th Person:** Even the 50th person to hear a single verse of the Lotus Sutra has more merit than a person who gives charity to the whole world for 80 years. Why? because material charity is finite; the Dharma-seed is infinite.

**3. The Circulation of the Sutra (*Liútōng Fēn*):**
Fayun groups the final chapters (17-28) into the 'Circulation Division.' He identifies two modes of propagation:
1.  **Transmission by Merit:** (Chapters 17-20) Encouraging people to spread the Sutra by promising vast rewards (Six Sense Purification).
2.  **Transmission by Example:** (Chapters 21-28) Using the stories of great Bodhisattvas (Medicine King, Wonderful Sound, Avalokiteshvara) as models for how to protect and spread the text in evil times.
    *   *Medicine King:* Self-sacrifice for the Dharma.
    *   *Avalokiteshvara:* Universal salvation through skill in means.
    *   *Samantabhadra:* The final protector who ensures the text survives the Later Day of the Law."
