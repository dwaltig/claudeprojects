"**1. The Nature of the Life Span (*Shòuliàng*):**
Fayun explains that the Buddha’s life span is measured in 'dust and sand' (*chénshā*). He reveals that his attainment of Buddhahood was not a recent event under the Bodhi tree, but occurred eons ago.
*   **The Traces (*Jī*):** The Buddha appearing to be born in the palace and attaining enlightenment is a 'Trace.'
*   **The Origin (*Běn*):** The Buddha has actually been enlightened for an incalculable time. This is the 'Origin.'

**2. The Parable of the Physician (*Liángyī Pì*):**
Fayun breaks this parable down into four logical stages of the Buddha's work across the Three Times (Past, Present, Future):
1.  **The Past:** The Buddha as the Wise Physician who knows the medicine.
2.  **The Present:** The children (beings) drinking poison (delusion) and the Father returning to save them.
3.  **The Future:** The Father appearing to 'die' (Nirvana) to cure the children's lack of respect and make them seek the medicine themselves.
4.  **The Proof:** Showing that this 'death' is not a lie, but a supreme skillful means.

**3. The Finite Nature of Life:**
Fayun makes a controversial claim: Although the Buddha's life is 'immeasurably long' (*wúliàng*), it is still **Conditioned (*Yǒuwéi*)**. He argues that the Buddha’s life span, though it lasts for countless kalpas, will ultimately have an end point. It is 'eternity within time' rather than absolute eternity."
