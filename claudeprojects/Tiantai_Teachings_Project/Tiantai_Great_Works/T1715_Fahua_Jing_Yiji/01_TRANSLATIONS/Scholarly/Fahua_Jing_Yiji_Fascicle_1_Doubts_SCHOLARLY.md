## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. Maitreya's Three Thoughts (*Mílé Sān Niàn*):**
When the Buddha emitted the light, Maitreya Bodhisattva had three distinct thoughts:
1.  **The Thought of Surprise:** 'Why is there this瑞 (ruì - portent)?' (Wondering about the cause).
2.  **The Thought of Inquiry:** 'Who should I ask?' (Wondering about the person).
3.  **The Thought of Resolution:** 'Manjushri has been close to many Buddhas; he must know.' (Resolving to ask Manjushri).

**2. The Four Stages of Manjushri's Answer:**
Manjushri does not answer immediately with a simple 'Yes.' He builds a logical case using four stages:
1.  **Reflecting (*Sīwéi*):** 'I suspect the Buddha wishes to speak the Great Dharma.' (A tentative hypothesis).
2.  **Citing the Past (*Yǐn Gǔ*):** 'I have seen this before.' (Establishing a precedent).
3.  **Broad Evidence (*Guǎng Yǐn*):** 'In the past, the Buddha Sun-Moon-Lamp (*Rìyuèdēngmíng*) did this...' (Detailed historical proof).
4.  **Concluding (*Jié Dá*):** 'Therefore, I know that today is the same as the past.' (Final judgment).

**3. The Ancient Precedent (Sun-Moon-Lamp Buddha):**
Manjushri recalls the Buddha **Sun-Moon-Lamp** (*Candrasūryapradīpa*).
*   **The Sign:** He preached the *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra*, entered Samadhi, and the earth shook.
*   **The Teaching:** He then preached the *Lotus Sutra* for **60 small kalpas**.
*   **The Transmission:** After his Nirvana, the Bodhisattva **Fine Light** (*Varaprabha*) maintained the Sutra.
*   **The Connection:** Fine Light was **Manjushri** himself; the lazy student **Seeker of Fame** (*Yaśaskāma*) was **Maitreya**. This proves that Manjushri is qualified to answer and Maitreya is the one to ask."
