## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. Defining 'Subtle Dharma' (*Miàofǎ*):**
The term 'Subtle' (*Miào*) refers to that which is extraordinary and transcends the 'coarse' (*cū*). In terms of the Dharma, it speaks of both Cause and Fruit.
In former days, the Buddha taught the Six Paramitas as the Cause, resulting in two kinds of fruit (Conditioned and Unconditioned). However, those were not the ultimate beauty; they were 'coarse.' Today, the Cause encompasses all ten thousand virtues as the 'Single Road of Return' (*Tóngguī zhī lù*). The Fruit is the 'Ultimate Fruit,' which is double the number of previous reckonings.

**2. Defining 'Lotus' (*Liánhuā*):**
The Lotus is an external metaphor. In nature, a plant must have both flower and fruit together. To speak of the Lotus's flower is like the Cause of the Fruit-family; to speak of the flower's Lotus is like the Fruit of the Cause-family. Because this Sutra demonstrates the simultaneity of the One-Vehicle Cause and Fruit, it borrows this metaphor and is named 'Lotus.'

**3. The Three Meanings of Subtlety (*Miào*):**
The 'Subtle' of today is contrasted with the 'Coarse' of the past through three specific criteria:
1.  **Length of Substance (*Tǐ cháng*):** The Cause of the past was short, only covering the Three Realms. The Cause of today is long, extending from the first aspiration to the 'Diamond Mind,' covering both inside and outside the Three Realms.
2.  **Breadth of Meaning (*Yì guǎng*):** The Cause of the past was narrow, only mentioning the Six Paramitas. Today’s Cause is broad, encompassing every virtue encountered.
3.  **Superiority of Function (*Yòng shèng*):** The past Cause only severed the 'Four Dwellings' of affliction. Today’s Cause is superior, severing the 'Dwellings of Ignorance' (*Wúmíng zhùdì*) as well."

## 📜 Doctrinal Analysis (Guangzhai View)
*   **Four Vehicles:** The "Three Vehicles" are distinct from the "One Vehicle" (the fourth). The Buddha's previous teachings were provisional (coarse), and only now is he revealing the true, distinct Fourth Vehicle.
*   **Impermanence of the Buddha:** Fayun interprets the "Eternal" life span as just "very long," whereas Tiantai argues for true literal Eternity.

> 「佛住王舍城」，此下是第四... 「與大比丘眾」此下訖「退坐一面」，是第五，出同聞眾證成一時...
> 萬二千人俱，皆是阿羅漢... 諸漏已盡...

"**1. The Five Common Prefaces (*Tōng Xù*):**
*   **'Thus':** Indicates the entire Sutra is what was heard.
*   **'I Heard':** Indicates Ananda is transmitting the words, not creating them.
*   **'At One Time':** Indicates the correspondence of the teaching with the capacity of the audience.
*   **'Buddha Dwells...':** Indicates the place (Gridhrakuta), verifying the 'I heard' is not false.
*   **'With the Great Bhikshu Assembly':** Lists the audience to prove the 'One Time' (correspondence).

**2. The Assembly Breakdown:**
*   **The 12,000 Arhats:** Why are they listed first? Because they are the 'Inner Kind' (*Nèizhòng*), constantly accompanying the Buddha.
*   **The Bodhisattvas (80,000):** Why listed second? Because they travel the ten directions to save beings and are not always at the Buddha's side ('Outer Kind').
*   **The Difference:** The Arhats have 'Small Names' (known locally); the Bodhisattvas have 'Great Names' (known universally).

**3. Defining 'Arhat' (*Luóhàn*):**
The term Arhat has three meanings, corresponding to the three meanings of 'Bhikshu':
1.  **Slayer of Thieves (*Shā Zéi*):** Killing the thieves of affliction (corresponds to Bhikshu as 'Destroyer of Evil').
2.  **Non-Birth (*Bù Shēng*):** No longer being reborn in the Three Realms (corresponds to Bhikshu as 'Frightener of Mara').
3.  **Worthy of Offerings (*Yìng Gòng*):** Worthy of receiving gifts from humans and gods (corresponds to Bhikshu as 'Mendicant')."

"**1. The Two Prefaces (*Èr Xù*):**
*   **The Common Preface (*Tōng Xù*):** From 'Thus have I heard' to 'sat to one side.' This is common to all Sutras, verifying the transmission.
*   **The Specific Preface (*Bié Xù*):** From 'At that time the World Honored One...' to the end of the Introduction. This is unique to the Lotus Sutra, setting the stage for the specific teaching.

**2. The Six Portents of this Earth (*Cǐ Tǔ Liù Ruì*):**
To reveal the 'One Vehicle,' the Buddha first displays six miraculous signs in this world:
1.  **Teaching the *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra* (*Wúliángyì Jīng*):** This serves as the 'roaming preface' (*Yóu Xù*) to the Lotus. It teaches that 'all dharmas flow from one source,' preparing the mind for the One Vehicle.
2.  **Entering the Samadhi of Immeasurable Meanings (*Rù Dìng*):** Silence before speech. The Buddha enters meditation to contemplate the 'Immeasurable Reality.'
3.  **Raining of Four Flowers (*Tiān Yǔ Sì Huā*):** Heaven rains Mandarava (white) and Manjushaka (red) flowers. This symbolizes the 'flowering' of the Cause before the Fruit.
4.  **Earth Shaking in Six Ways (*Dì Liù Zhòng Dòng*):** The earth shakes (east rises, west sinks, etc.). This symbolizes the breaking of the six rigid attachments of the Six Realms.
5.  **The Assembly Rejoicing (*Dàzhòng Huānxǐ*):** The hearts of the audience are gladdened, signaling their readiness to receive the Great Dharma.
6.  **Emitting the Light (*Fàng Guāng*):** The Buddha emits a ray of light from his white hair tuft (*Báiháo*), illuminating 18,000 worlds to the East. This is the 'Sign of Manifestation' (*Xiǎn Xiàng*).

**3. The Meaning of 'East':**
Why the East? The East is the direction of the rising sun, symbolizing the beginning of wisdom and the 'Origin' of the teaching. It represents the start of the 'Great Cause' (*Dà Yīn*)."

## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. Maitreya's Three Thoughts (*Mílé Sān Niàn*):**
When the Buddha emitted the light, Maitreya Bodhisattva had three distinct thoughts:
1.  **The Thought of Surprise:** 'Why is there this瑞 (ruì - portent)?' (Wondering about the cause).
2.  **The Thought of Inquiry:** 'Who should I ask?' (Wondering about the person).
3.  **The Thought of Resolution:** 'Manjushri has been close to many Buddhas; he must know.' (Resolving to ask Manjushri).

**2. The Four Stages of Manjushri's Answer:**
Manjushri does not answer immediately with a simple 'Yes.' He builds a logical case using four stages:
1.  **Reflecting (*Sīwéi*):** 'I suspect the Buddha wishes to speak the Great Dharma.' (A tentative hypothesis).
2.  **Citing the Past (*Yǐn Gǔ*):** 'I have seen this before.' (Establishing a precedent).
3.  **Broad Evidence (*Guǎng Yǐn*):** 'In the past, the Buddha Sun-Moon-Lamp (*Rìyuèdēngmíng*) did this...' (Detailed historical proof).
4.  **Concluding (*Jié Dá*):** 'Therefore, I know that today is the same as the past.' (Final judgment).

**3. The Ancient Precedent (Sun-Moon-Lamp Buddha):**
Manjushri recalls the Buddha **Sun-Moon-Lamp** (*Candrasūryapradīpa*).
*   **The Sign:** He preached the *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra*, entered Samadhi, and the earth shook.
*   **The Teaching:** He then preached the *Lotus Sutra* for **60 small kalpas**.
*   **The Transmission:** After his Nirvana, the Bodhisattva **Fine Light** (*Varaprabha*) maintained the Sutra.
*   **The Connection:** Fine Light was **Manjushri** himself; the lazy student **Seeker of Fame** (*Yaśaskāma*) was **Maitreya**. This proves that Manjushri is qualified to answer and Maitreya is the one to ask."
