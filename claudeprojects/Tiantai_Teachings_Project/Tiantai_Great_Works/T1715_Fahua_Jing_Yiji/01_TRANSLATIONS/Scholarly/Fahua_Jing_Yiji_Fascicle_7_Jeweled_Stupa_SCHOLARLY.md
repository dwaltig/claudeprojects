## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. The Prophecy for Ananda and Rahula:**
Fayun explains why these two specific disciples are singled out in Chapter 9:
*   **Ananda:** Represents those who are 'Learners' (*Xué*). He is the Keeper of the Dharma Storehouse. His prophecy ensures the transmission of the teaching.
*   **Rahula:** Represents the 'Non-Learners' (*Wú Xué* - in practice, though technically he might still be learning in some classifications, here he stands for the quiet practice). As the Buddha's biological son, his prophecy resolves the doubt that 'family connection' is a barrier to enlightenment.

**2. The Prophecy for the 2,000:**
The simultaneous prophecy for the 2,000 Learners and Non-Learners signifies the 'Universal Rain.' It shows that the One Vehicle is not just for the elite leaders (like Sariputra and Kashyapa) but for the mass of the Sangha. Fayun notes they all receive the same title: **Jewel Sign Tathagata** (*Baoxiang Rulai*), indicating the uniformity of their realization.

**3. The Jeweled Stupa (*Bǎo Tǎ*):**
Fayun divides the miraculous appearance of the Stupa into specific doctrinal functions:
1.  **Verification (*Zhèng Míng*):** The Stupa rises from the earth to verify the truth of the Lotus Sutra. The past Buddha (Many Jewels) comes to witness the present Buddha (Shakyamuni).
2.  **The Two Buddhas Seated Together:** When Shakyamuni opens the Stupa and sits next to Many Jewels, it symbolizes the **Non-Duality of the Trace and the Origin**.
    *   *Many Jewels:* Represents the Eternal Dharma Body (Origin).
    *   *Shakyamuni:* Represents the Manifested Response Body (Trace).
    *   *Sitting Together:* Shows that the Phenomenal and the Noumenal are one reality."
