## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. The Five Common Prefaces (*Tōng Xù*):**
*   **'Thus':** Indicates the entire Sutra is what was heard.
*   **'I Heard':** Indicates Ananda is transmitting the words, not creating them.
*   **'At One Time':** Indicates the correspondence of the teaching with the capacity of the audience.
*   **'Buddha Dwells...':** Indicates the place (Gridhrakuta), verifying the 'I heard' is not false.
*   **'With the Great Bhikshu Assembly':** Lists the audience to prove the 'One Time' (correspondence).

**2. The Assembly Breakdown:**
*   **The 12,000 Arhats:** Why are they listed first? Because they are the 'Inner Kind' (*Nèizhòng*), constantly accompanying the Buddha.
*   **The Bodhisattvas (80,000):** Why listed second? Because they travel the ten directions to save beings and are not always at the Buddha's side ('Outer Kind').
*   **The Difference:** The Arhats have 'Small Names' (known locally); the Bodhisattvas have 'Great Names' (known universally).

**3. Defining 'Arhat' (*Luóhàn*):**
The term Arhat has three meanings, corresponding to the three meanings of 'Bhikshu':
1.  **Slayer of Thieves (*Shā Zéi*):** Killing the thieves of affliction (corresponds to Bhikshu as 'Destroyer of Evil').
2.  **Non-Birth (*Bù Shēng*):** No longer being reborn in the Three Realms (corresponds to Bhikshu as 'Frightener of Mara').
3.  **Worthy of Offerings (*Yìng Gòng*):** Worthy of receiving gifts from humans and gods (corresponds to Bhikshu as 'Mendicant')."
