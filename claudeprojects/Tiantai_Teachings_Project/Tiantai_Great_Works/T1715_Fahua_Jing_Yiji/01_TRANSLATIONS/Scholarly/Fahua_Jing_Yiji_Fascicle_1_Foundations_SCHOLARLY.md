## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. Defining 'Subtle Dharma' (*Miàofǎ*):**
The term 'Subtle' (*Miào*) refers to that which is extraordinary and transcends the 'coarse' (*cū*). In terms of the Dharma, it speaks of both Cause and Fruit.
In former days, the Buddha taught the Six Paramitas as the Cause, resulting in two kinds of fruit (Conditioned and Unconditioned). However, those were not the ultimate beauty; they were 'coarse.' Today, the Cause encompasses all ten thousand virtues as the 'Single Road of Return' (*Tóngguī zhī lù*). The Fruit is the 'Ultimate Fruit,' which is double the number of previous reckonings.

**2. Defining 'Lotus' (*Liánhuā*):**
The Lotus is an external metaphor. In nature, a plant must have both flower and fruit together. To speak of the Lotus's flower is like the Cause of the Fruit-family; to speak of the flower's Lotus is like the Fruit of the Cause-family. Because this Sutra demonstrates the simultaneity of the One-Vehicle Cause and Fruit, it borrows this metaphor and is named 'Lotus.'

**3. The Three Meanings of Subtlety (*Miào*):**
The 'Subtle' of today is contrasted with the 'Coarse' of the past through three specific criteria:
1.  **Length of Substance (*Tǐ cháng*):** The Cause of the past was short, only covering the Three Realms. The Cause of today is long, extending from the first aspiration to the 'Diamond Mind,' covering both inside and outside the Three Realms.
2.  **Breadth of Meaning (*Yì guǎng*):** The Cause of the past was narrow, only mentioning the Six Paramitas. Today’s Cause is broad, encompassing every virtue encountered.
3.  **Superiority of Function (*Yòng shèng*):** The past Cause only severed the 'Four Dwellings' of affliction. Today’s Cause is superior, severing the 'Dwellings of Ignorance' (*Wúmíng zhùdì*) as well."

## 📜 Doctrinal Analysis (Guangzhai View)
*   **Four Vehicles:** The "Three Vehicles" are distinct from the "One Vehicle" (the fourth). The Buddha's previous teachings were provisional (coarse), and only now is he revealing the true, distinct Fourth Vehicle.
*   **Impermanence of the Buddha:** Fayun interprets the "Eternal" life span as just "very long," whereas Tiantai argues for true literal Eternity.
