## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. The Nine Metaphors of the Poor Son (*Jiǔ Pì*):**
Fayun breaks the Parable of the Poor Son (Chapter 4) into nine stages, which he aligns with the history of the soul's relationship with the Buddha:
1.  **Separation of Father and Son:** The 'Original Loss' where the son (sentient being) wanders away from the Father (Buddha) into the Six Realms.
2.  **The Reunion (Seeing the Father):** The son accidentally encounters the Father but is terrified by his wealth and power.
3.  **Failure to Call the Son:** The Father's initial attempt to bring the son back via the Great Vehicle fails due to the son's fear.
4.  **Successful Recruitment:** The Father sends 'emissaries' (provisional teachings) to hire the son for menial labor (clearing dung).
5.  **Instruction in Labor:** The son works for 20 years, gradually becoming familiar with the household.
6.  **Entrusting the Wealth (*Fù Cáiwù*):** The Father puts the son in charge of the accounts (the *Prajnaparamita* teachings), but the son still does not claim ownership.
7.  **Growth of the Son's Ambition:** The son's mind gradually expands and becomes noble.
8.  **Granting the Inheritance:** The Father publicly declares the son as his heir and hands over the entire estate.
9.  **Rejoicing in the Inheritance:** The son finally realizes his true status as a Buddha-Son.

**2. The *Prajna* Connection:**
Fayun makes a critical historical link at stage 6. He argues that the Father 'putting the son in charge of accounts' represents the **Prajnaparamita Period**. In those sutras, the Sravakas (Arhats) were told to teach the Bodhisattva path to others, essentially 'managing' the Buddha's wealth, even though they themselves still believed they were 'dung-clearers' (Arhats) and not future Buddhas."
