## 🏛️ The Guangzhai Master's Translation

"**1. The Nature of Prophecy (*Shòujì*):**
Fayun explains that 'Prophecy' involves two aspects:
1.  **The Granting (*Shòu*):** The Buddha's act of giving the prediction (The Teacher's side).
2.  **The Receiving (*Jì*):** The disciple's act of taking the assurance of future Buddhahood (The Student's side).
Prophecy is not just a 'fortune telling'; it is the formalizing of the 'One Vehicle' cause. It transforms the Arhat's mind into a Bodhisattva's mind by giving them a specific target (a future Buddha-name and land).

**2. The Parable of the Phantom City (*Huàchéng Pì*):**
Fayun breaks this down into five logical sub-metaphors:
1.  **The Guide:** The Buddha.
2.  **The Travelers:** Sentient beings seeking the Treasure.
3.  **The Difficult Path:** The 500 *yojanas* of the Three Realms and the secondary afflictions.
4.  **The Phantom City:** Nirvana as understood by the Sravakas. It is a 'conjured' city, a place to rest, not the final destination.
5.  **The Treasure Land:** The ultimate Buddhahood (One Vehicle).

**3. The '300 and 500' Logic:**
Fayun argues that the 300 *yojanas* represent the point where the Sravakas 'rest' in Arhatship (The Phantom City). The final 200 *yojanas* represent the distance from Arhatship to Buddhahood. The Phantom City is necessary because the travelers are 'exhausted' and 'terrified' by the long road. Without the rest stop, they would give up and turn back."
