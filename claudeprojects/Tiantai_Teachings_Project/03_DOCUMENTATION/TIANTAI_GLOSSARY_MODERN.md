# Tiantai Glossary - Modern English

## The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra (Modern English)

- **Five Chapters**: Tiantai framework for reading a sutra: Title, Substance, Essence, Function, and Teaching Classification.
- **Ten Subtleties**: Ten technical lenses used to reveal the Lotus as complete. In the Trace Gate they run from Realm to Benefits; in the Fundamental Gate they begin with Fundamental Cause and end with Fundamental Benefits.
- **Reality-Mark**: The ultimate seal of all dharmas. The nondual reality that underlies both emptiness and form.
- **Three Truths**: Emptiness, Provisional, and Middle understood as simultaneous.
- **Middle**: The nondual reality that includes emptiness and provisional without being limited by either.
- **Dharma-Realm**: The complete field of reality in which all dharmas arise and interpenetrate.
- **One Vehicle**: The single path that all teachings ultimately return to.
- **Trace Gate / Fundamental Gate**: The historical display of the Buddha (Trace) and the eternal Buddha revealed in the Lifespan chapter (Fundamental).
- **Round Gate**: The Perfect Teaching's entry point where birth-and-death is Dharma-nature and all gates are one.
- **Four Gates**: Existence, Emptiness, Both, and Neither; entry points rather than fixed positions.
- **Four Siddhantas**: Worldly, For-Each-Person, Therapeutic, and First Principle; four modes of teaching adapted to readiness.
- **Five Flavors / Five Periods**: Milk, Curds, Fresh Butter, Clarified Butter, Ghee; the temporal ordering of the Buddha's teaching career.
- **Four Teachings**: Tripitaka, Shared, Distinct, Perfect; doctrinal classifications of content.
- **Three Tracks**: True Nature, Contemplative Illumination, Resource Accomplishment; one reality spoken from three angles.
- **Three Virtues**: Dharma-body, Prajna, Liberation; the revealed form of the Three Tracks.
- **Three Obstacles**: Root ignorance, view-and-thought, dust-and-sand; confusions that obscure the Three Tracks.
- **Ten Contemplations**: The Tiantai meditation sequence for entering the real through the Round Gate.
- **Four Sentences of Resonance**: Hidden/Hidden, Hidden/Manifest, Manifest/Manifest, Manifest/Hidden; how stimulus and response function.
- **Three Cycles of Benefit**: Root (sowing), Ripening (maturing), Release (harvest); benefit spans lifetimes.
- **Opening/Combining**: The Lotus opens provisional teachings and recombines them into the One Vehicle.
- **Coarse/Subtle**: The provisional vs the complete; coarse is expedient and partial, subtle is nondual and complete.
- **Essence**: The Lotus aim of One Vehicle cause-and-fruit across Trace and Fundamental gates.
- **Function**: The Lotus power to break doubt and generate faith.
