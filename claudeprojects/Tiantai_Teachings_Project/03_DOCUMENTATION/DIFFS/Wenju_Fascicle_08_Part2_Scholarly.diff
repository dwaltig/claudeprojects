-## Explanation of the Vision of the Jeweled Stupa Chapter
-
-**(Text Lines 192-231)**
-
-### 1. Title Explanation
-
-**"Vision of the Jeweled Stupa" (*Jiàn Bǎo Tǎ Pǐn*):**
-*   **Stupa (*Tǎ Pó*):** Sanskrit *Stupa* or *Thupa*. Translated as "Square Grave" (*Fāng Fén*) or "Sacred Shrine" (*Líng Miào*). Also called *Caitya* (*Zhī Tí*) if it contains no bodily relics.
-    *   *Note:* Since this Stupa contains the Whole Body (of Prabhutaratna) undispersed, it is technically not a Caitya (which usually lacks relics), but the text and tradition vary.
-    *   *Four Caityas (Agama):* Birth, Enlightenment, Turning Wheel, Nirvana.
-    *   *Lotus Stupa:* The Stupa of the **Primal Buddha's Nirvana**.
-*   **Significance:**
-    *   **Three Bodies:** The Buddha's Three Bodies are born from this Sutra.
-    *   **Proof:** The Stupa emerges to prove the validity of the previous teaching ("Opening the Provisional").
-    *   **Four Assemblies See It:** Hence "Vision" (*Jiàn*).
-*   **Whole vs. Fragmented Relics:**
-    *   *Small Vehicle:* Fragmented relics (bones) vs. Whole body.
-    *   *Lotus:* The **Dharma Body** is the Relic. This Sutra is the Whole Body of the Dharma Body.
-*   **Why Now?**
-    *   *Northern Master's View:* It should have appeared during the preaching. Appearing after seems late.
-    *   *Tiantai Critique:* It appears to prove the **Three Weeks of Preaching** (Dharma/Parable/Causality) were True. And to open the **Future** (lifespan).
-*   **Symbolism of the Stupa:**
-    *   **From Earth:** Shows the Dharma Body is not extinguished (Permanent).
-    *   **In Sky:** Shows the Dharma Body is transcendent (Space-like).
-    *   **Duo Bao (Many Jewels):** Represents the **Dharma Body Buddha** (Truth).
-    *   **Shakyamuni:** Represents the **Reward Body Buddha** (Wisdom).
-    *   **Branch Buddhas:** Represents the **Response Body Buddha** (Action).
-    *   *Three in One:* Though three, they are not different.
-

-*   **"All is Truth" (*Jiē Shì Zhēn Shí*):**
-    *   *Specific:* Matches the Reality Mark.
-    *   *General:* Matches the Absolute (beyond words).
-    *   *Middle:* Matches the Eight Negations.
-
-**C. Doubt and Question:**
-*   **Question 1:** Why this Stupa?
-*   **Question 2:** Why from the Earth?
-*   **Question 3:** Why the Sound?
-*   *(Buddha answers only #2 and #1 explicitly, #3 implies proof).*
-
-**D. Branch Buddhas and Opening the Stupa:**
-*   **Shakyamuni's Light:** Summons the Branch Buddhas from ten directions.
-    *   *Why?* To open the Stupa (Prabhutaratna's Vow: "When my Stupa is opened, all Buddhas must gather").
-    *   *Meaning:* Gathering the Traces (Branch Buddhas) to return to the Origin (Dharma Body).
-*   **Purifying the Lands (Three Transformations):**
-    *   1st: Purifying Saha (Turning Earth to Lapis Lazuli). Removes **Great Earth** (Desire/Form).
-    *   2nd: Purifying 200 Myriad Lands. Removes **Dust/Sand** (Bodhisattva's ignorance).
-    *   3rd: Purifying another 200 Myriad. Removes **Ignorance**.
-*   **Opening the Stupa:** 
-    *   *"Like opening a lock":* Removing the obstruction.
-    *   **Sharing the Seat:** Shakyamuni enters and sits with Duo Bao.
-        *   *Meaning:* Trace (Shakyamuni) and Origin (Duo Bao) are Non-Dual.
-        *   *Structure:* "Three Buddhas" (Duo Bao, Shakyamuni, Branches).
-
-### 3. Entrustment (Selling the Dharma)
-
-**(Lines 226-231)**
-**"Shakyamuni sees the Buddhas gathered..."**
-*   **The Advertisement (Casting the Net):** "Who can guard this Sutra?"
-*   **Reason:** "The Tathagata will soon enter Nirvana."
-*   **Two Entrustments:**
-    1.  **Near:** To the 80,000 Bodhisattvas present.
-    2.  **Far:** To the "Underground" Bodhisattvas (implied/future).
-
-**Verses (48 Lines):**
-*   Praising the Stupa, the gathering, and the difficulty of holding the Sutra.
-*   **"Six Difficulties and Nine Easies":**
-    *   *Easy:* Kicking the galaxy, holding the earth, preaching other sutras.
-    *   *Difficult:* Preaching/Holding the *Lotus Sutra* in the evil age.
-    *   *Why?* Because it attacks the root of ignorance and requires the full "Opening of the Provisional."

-## Explanation of the Devadatta Chapter
-
-**(Text Lines 232-275)**
-
-### 1. Title and Historical Context
-
-**"Devadatta" (*Tí Pó Dá Duō*):**
-*   **Meaning:** *Deva* = Heaven/God. *Datta* = Given (*Tiān Shòu*) or Heat (*Tiān Rè*).
-    *   **Trace Interpretation:** Born when the gods were hot/feverish/angry. "Heavenly Heat."
-    *   **Origin Interpretation:** The Bodhisattva manifests "Heat" (Desire/Anger) equal to the sentient beings' "Fever" to cure them. (Principle of "Same Illness, Same Cure").
-*   **Textual History (Bao Chang's Catalog):**
-    *   **Translations:** Four versions. Dharmaraksha (Western Jin) translated the *Zheng Fahua* (Correct Lotus). Kumarajiva (Later Qin) translated the *Miao Fahua* (Wonderful Lotus).
-    *   **Missing Chapter:** In Kumarajiva's original translation (at Chang'an), the "Devadatta Chapter" was missing or kept separate (called the *Tian Pin*). Later, Fa Xian obtained the Sanskrit text in the South.
-    *   **Reintegration:** Master Paramartha (Liang Dynasty) and Nanyue Huisi (Chen Dynasty) integrated it. Huisi placed it *after* the Stupa chapter, matching Dharmaraksha's version. Tiantai Zhiyi follows this ordering.
-
-### 2. Analysis of the Chapter
-
-The chapter has two main sections:
-1.  **Past (King and Seer):** Shakyamuni (King) and Devadatta (Seer). Shows the **Merit of the Teacher** (Devadatta) and the **Diligence of the Disciple** (Shakyamuni).
-2.  **Present (Manjushri and Dragon Girl):** Shows the effectiveness of the Sutra in the present (Dragon Girl's Instant Buddhahood).
-
-**A. The Past: King Seeking Dharma**
-*   **The King:** A past life of Shakyamuni. He was a King who "bored holes in his body to light lamps" (in other sutras) or served as a slave (here) for the Dharma.
-*   **The Seer (*Asita*):** A past life of Devadatta. He possessed the *Lotus Sutra*.
-*   **Six Paramitas (Hexadu):**
-    *   The King sought to fulfill the Six Paramitas.
-    *   *Tiantai Analysis of the Six Paramitas:*
-        1.  **Tripitaka Level:** Giving material wealth, keeping rules against 7 sins, etc. (Counteractive).
-        2.  **Common Level:** Giving with "Three Wheels Empty" (No Giver, Receiver, Gift).
-        3.  **Separate Level:** Giving with "Ten Benefits" (countering stinginess, etc.).
-        4.  **Round Level:** "Seeking the Buddha Way." Every act of giving is for the sake of the One Vehicle.
-*   **32 Marks:** The text mentions fulfilling the 32 Marks.
-    *   *Examples:* Flat feet (Firm Charity), Long fingers (Non-Killing), etc.
-    *   *Tiantai:* These are the "Trace Marks" (Reward Body). The Real Mark is the "Dharma Body Mark" (No Mark).
-
-**B. Convergence and Prophecy:**
-*   Shakyamuni says: "Because of Devadatta's Good Friend ( *Shàn Zhī Shí*) power, I attained the 32 Marks and Buddhahood."
-*   **Prophecy:** Devadatta will become **Heavenly King Buddha** (*Tiān Wáng Fó*).
-    *   *Significance:* Even though Devadatta committed the **Five Deadly Sins** (Wounding Buddha, Killing Arhat, etc.) in the Trace, his **Origin** is a Great Bodhisattva who helped the Buddha.
-    *   This proves that there is no fixed "Evil" nature; the Lotus can transform even the Ichantika.
-
-**C. The Present: Manjushri and the Dragon Girl**
-*   **Manjushri from the Sea:**
-    *   Wisdom Accumulation Bodhisattva (*Zhì Jī*) asks: "How many beings have you saved?"
-    *   Manjushri: "Innumerable." (Lotus flowers emerge from the sea to prove it).
-*   **Dragon Girl's Enlightenment:**
-    *   **The Being:** Daughter of Dragon Sagara. 8 Years Old.
-    *   **The Act:** Offers a Precious Jewel to the Buddha.
-    *   **The Speed:** "Is this offer quick?" "Yes." "My becoming a Buddha is faster than that."
-    *   **The Transformation:** Instantly turns into a male, goes to the Southern Spotless World, and sits on the Lotus Throne as a Buddha.
-*   **Meaning:**
-    *   **Dragon (Animal):** Overcoming the obstruction of lower rebirth.
-    *   **Female:** Overcoming the obstruction of gender (Five Obstructions).
-    *   **Young (8 Years):** Overcoming the obstruction of time/age.
-    *   **Southern World:** Represents the Sravaka (Growth/Rightness).
-    *   **Instant:** This is the **Power of the Lotus Sutra** (*Lì Yòng*). It opens the Provisional (Dragon/Female body) to reveal the Real (Buddha Nature).
-    *   **Silent Faith:** Sariputra (representing the doubting Sravaka) and Wisdom Accumulation (representing the doubting Bodhisattva) are silenced by the fact.

+梵言塔婆，[8]或偷婆，此翻方墳，亦言靈廟。又言支提，無骨身者也。此塔既有全身不散，則不稱支提。《阿含》明四支徵(知[9]倚切)，謂生處、得道、轉法輪、入滅四處起塔，今之寶塔是先佛入滅支徵。經云，佛三種身從此經生，諸佛於此而坐道場、諸佛於此而轉法輪、諸佛於此而般涅槃，[10]秖此《法華》即是三世諸佛之四支徵。先佛已居，今佛並坐，當佛亦然。此塔出來明顯此事，四眾皆覩，故言「見寶塔品」。《瓔珞經》善吉問「生身全身碎身功德等耶？」佛言「不等。色身言教化訓，三業具足清淨，眾生得至道場；全碎舍利正可威神光明，供養得福，是故不等。」又問頂王如來「十二那術劫說法教化，舍利亦爾此應是等。」佛言「皆頂王如來神力所作耳。」彼經格全碎舍利皆由生身佛力，今經格生身全碎舍利、法身偏圓舍利皆從經出，顯此經功德弘持力大，從地[1]涌來證明此事，四眾皆覩，故言「見寶塔品」。北地師云：「佛為身子說經時，寶塔已現為作證明，若說經竟，來證何等？經家作次第，安置三周後耳。」此乃人情則不可信。今依《薩雲分陀利經》云「佛說法華無央數偈時，有七寶塔從地涌出，中有金床，床上有佛，字袍休蘭羅，漢言大寶，歎釋尊言：『我故來供養，願坐我金床，更為我說《薩[2]雲分陀利》。』」依此經證即是說三周，後更請壽量，明文聖說而不肯用，人之穿鑿那可承耶？此塔正為證前請後從地涌出，四眾皆覩，故言「見寶塔品」。地師說多寶是法身佛；《釋論》說多寶誓願化身來證經，此文亦爾。師言，法身無來無出，報身巍巍堂堂，應身普應一切，若即此謂是三佛者，未盡其體也，[＊10-1]秖是表示而已，多寶表法佛，釋尊表報佛，分身表應佛，三佛雖三而不一異，應作如[3]此說，如此信解也。此四番即四悉檀解見寶塔云云。塔出為兩：一、發音聲以證前，開塔以起後。證前者，證三周說法皆是真實，若略言真實者，皆與實相相應也；若廣言真實者，離四句絕百非也；若處中說者，八不名真實。塔從地涌示不滅，分座共坐示不生，入塔示不常，現塔示不斷，分身示不一，全身示不異，多寶讓座示不來，釋迦坐半座示不出，八不顯然，故是真實。又證迹門流通，持經功深弘宣力大，皆真實也。「平等大慧」者，與般若云何？《釋論》七十九云「般若是三世諸佛妙法，如一城門四方皆入」，當知[4]般若亦稱妙法，此經稱平等大慧，二文相指其意可知。起後者，若欲開塔，須集分身明玄付囑，聲徹下方召本弟子論於壽量，久遠之塔從地涌出，開自在神通之力，顯過去世益物也。發大音聲，開師[5]子奮迅之力，顯現在十方開權顯實也。有大誓願，未來諸佛若說此經，我之寶塔皆到其所為作證明，開大勢威猛之力，顯未來常住不滅也。又塔在空中亦證前起後，七方便人藏理未開無明所隱，如塔在地；聞三周開三顯實開佛知見，顯出法身如塔涌空此即證前；修得法身久已明著，如塔在空無能開者，表本地久成眾所不識。若發迹顯本了達無疑，此即起後也。若塔從地出，表法身顯，與餘經亦同亦異，菩薩顯法身則同，二乘顯法身則異。若塔在空開門見佛，表發迹顯本，與餘經永異。若塔來證，前事已彰灼，蓋不須疑；塔來起後，密有其意眾所未知，今取後義預作此釋亦復無咎。觀心解者，依經修觀與法身相應境智必會，如塔來證經，境智既會則大報圓滿，如釋迦與多寶同坐一座，以大報圓故隨機出應，如分身皆集，由多寶出故則三佛得顯，由持經故即具三身，《普賢觀》云「佛三種身從方等生」，即此義也。有人分此品下十一品，是神通身輪開本迹，從「彌勒問」下，是說法口輪開本迹，本迹意未彰，從此分文太早(云云)。

+The Sanskrit is *stūpa*, [8] or *thūpa*; it is translated as “square tomb,” and also called a numinous shrine. It is also called *caitya*, for those without bodily bones. Since this stupa has a complete body not dispersed, it is not called a caitya. The Āgamas explain the four caitya‑sites (pronounced [9] yǐ‑qiè): the places of birth, awakening, turning the Dharma wheel, and entering extinction, where stupas are raised. This jeweled stupa is the caitya‑site of a prior Buddha’s extinction. The sutra says that the Buddha’s three bodies arise from this sutra: all Buddhas here sit at the site of awakening, all Buddhas here turn the Dharma wheel, all Buddhas here enter parinirvāṇa; [10] only this *Lotus* is the four caitya‑sites of the Buddhas of the three times. Previous Buddhas have already resided; the present Buddha now sits; future Buddhas will be the same. This stupa emerges to make this clear; the four assemblies all see it; therefore it is called the “Vision of the Jeweled Stupa” chapter. The *Yingluo Sūtra* says that Sujāti asked, “Are the merits of the living body, the whole‑body relics, and the fragmented relics equal?” The Buddha said, “Not equal. The physical body teaches and transforms; the three karmas are fully pure, and beings reach the site of awakening. Whole or fragmented relics only display numinous light; offerings gain merit. Therefore they are not equal.” He further asked the Topping‑King Tathāgata, “For twelve nayuta kalpas you preached and taught; the relics likewise should be equal.” The Buddha said, “All are produced by the supernatural power of the Topping‑King Tathāgata.” That sutra measures whole and fragmented relics as all due to the Buddha‑power of the living body; this sutra measures the living‑body relics, whole and fragmented relics, and the partial and complete relics of the Dharma‑body as all arising from this sutra, showing that this sutra’s merit and the power of upholding are great. The stupa rises from the ground [1] to prove this; the four assemblies all see it; therefore it is called the “Vision of the Jeweled Stupa” chapter. The Northern teacher says: “When the Buddha preached to Śāriputra, the jeweled stupa already appeared to certify it; if it came after the preaching, what would it certify? The compiler arranged the sequence and placed it after the three cycles.” This is merely human sentiment and cannot be trusted. Now, according to the *Sāyun‑Phundarīka Sūtra*, it says: “When the Buddha preached the Lotus for innumerable verses, a seven‑jeweled stupa emerged from the ground. Within was a golden couch; on the couch was a Buddha named Pao‑xiulānluó, in Chinese ‘Great Jewel,’ who praised Śākyamuni saying, ‘I came to make offerings. I wish to sit on my golden couch, and for me you should again preach the Sā[2]yun‑Phundarīka.’” Relying on that sutra, this proves that he had already preached the three cycles, and later again requested the lifespan. The explicit text is holy speech, yet some refused to use it; how could we accept human fabrications? This stupa precisely rises from the ground to certify the earlier and request the later; the four assemblies all see it; therefore it is called the “Vision of the Jeweled Stupa” chapter. The Northern teacher says Many‑Jewels is the Dharma‑body Buddha; the *Treatise* says Many‑Jewels is a transformation body produced by vows to certify the sutra; this text is the same. The teacher says: the Dharma‑body neither comes nor goes; the reward body is lofty and grand; the response body responds everywhere. If one takes these as the three Buddhas, one has not exhausted their substance; [＊10‑1] this is only an indication. Many‑Jewels indicates the Dharma‑Buddha, Śākyamuni indicates the reward‑Buddha, and the division bodies indicate the response‑Buddha. Though three, they are not one nor different; one should speak thus and understand thus. These four explanations are the four siddhāntas for interpreting the vision of the jeweled stupa, etc. The stupa’s emergence has two functions: first, it issues a sound to certify what precedes; second, it opens the stupa to initiate what follows. Certifying what precedes means certifying that the three cycles of preaching are all true: if stated briefly, they all accord with real‑mark; if stated broadly, they are beyond the four propositions and cut off the hundred negations; if stated from the middle, the eight negations are true. The stupa rising from the ground shows non‑extinction; dividing the seat and sitting together shows non‑birth; entering the stupa shows non‑constancy; displaying the stupa shows non‑cessation; the division bodies show not‑one; the complete body shows not‑different; Many‑Jewels yielding the seat shows not‑coming; Śākyamuni sitting on half the seat shows not‑going. The eight negations are manifest; thus it is true. It also certifies the trace‑gate circulation: the merit of holding the sutra is deep and the power of propagating it is great; all are true. “Equal great wisdom” — how does it compare to prajñā? *Treatise* 79 says, “Prajñā is the wondrous Dharma of the Buddhas of the three times; like one city gate, it is entered from the four directions.” Thus know that prajñā is also called wondrous Dharma. This sutra is called “equal great wisdom”; the two texts point to each other and the meaning can be known. Initiating what follows: if one wishes to open the stupa, one must gather the division bodies, clarify the mysterious entrustment, and with a sound reaching the lower realms summon the original disciples to discuss the lifespan. The ancient stupa rises from the ground, opening the power of自在神通 and manifesting benefit to past worlds. It issues a great sound, opening the lion’s rapid‑stride power, manifesting the present opening of the provisional and revealing of the real in the ten directions. It has a great vow: when future Buddhas preach this sutra, my jeweled stupa will come to their place to certify it, opening the great might and showing future constant non‑extinction. Moreover, the stupa in空 also certifies what precedes and initiates what follows: the seven expedient persons hide the principle, not yet opened and obscured by ignorance, like the stupa in the ground; when they hear the three cycles and open the three to reveal the real, opening Buddha‑knowledge, the Dharma‑body appears like the stupa rising into空 — this certifies what precedes. When one cultivates and the Dharma‑body has long been bright, it is like the stupa in空 that no one can open, showing the original ground long accomplished and unknown to the assembly. If one reveals traces and displays the origin and understands without doubt, that is initiating what follows. If the stupa rises from the ground, it indicates the Dharma‑body manifest; this is the same as other sutras for bodhisattvas manifesting the Dharma‑body, but different for the two vehicles manifesting the Dharma‑body. If the stupa is in空 and its door is opened to see the Buddha, it indicates revealing traces and displaying the origin, and is entirely different from other sutras. If the stupa comes to certify, the prior matters are already clear and there is no need to doubt; if the stupa comes to initiate what follows, it secretly has meaning unknown to the crowd — here we take the latter meaning in advance, and it is not blameworthy. In the contemplation‑of‑mind interpretation: by practicing contemplation in accordance with the sutra, one corresponds with the Dharma‑body and the object and wisdom must meet. When the stupa comes to certify the sutra, the object and wisdom meeting means the great retribution is complete, like Śākyamuni and Many‑Jewels sitting together on one seat. Because the great retribution is complete, responses appear according to capacities, like all the division bodies gathering; because Many‑Jewels emerges, the three Buddhas are revealed; because one upholds the sutra, one immediately possesses the three bodies. *Samantabhadra Contemplation* says, “The Buddha’s three bodies arise from the Vaipulya”; this is that meaning. Some people divide the eleven chapters below this as opening origin and trace by the body‑wheel, and from “Maitreya asks” as opening origin and trace by the mouth‑wheel. But the intent of origin and trace is not yet manifest; dividing the text here is too early (etc.).

+This chapter has prose and verse. The prose has three: (1) clarifying Many‑Jewels’ emergence, (2) clarifying the distant gathering of division bodies, (3) clarifying Śākyamuni’s call to seek those who will circulate the sutra. The first text has six: (1) the stupa’s appearance, (2) the gods’ offerings, (3) Many‑Jewels’ praise, (4) the assembly’s surprise, (5) Great Joy of Preaching’s question, (6) the Tathāgata’s answer. “A stupa of seven jewels” means the ground of the Dharma‑body is endowed by nature with the seven awakening factors and the seven noble treasures; the stupa is the境 of real‑mark, the place on which the Dharma‑body depends. “Five hundred yojanas in height” is twenty thousand li, indicating vertically the ten‑thousand practices in the cause and ten‑thousand virtues in the result. “Two hundred fifty yojanas in width” is ten thousand li, indicating horizontally the ten‑thousand good qualities as adornments. “Earth” is the ground of ignorance: by having nothing to break, it breaks ignorance; by having nothing to dwell in, it dwells in first‑principle emptiness. “Various treasures” are the multitude of samādhi and wisdom as adornment. “Railings” are dhāraṇī. “Myriad niches” are the rooms of infinite compassion, also the empty houses of infinite emptiness. “Banners and pennants” are the superior marks of supernatural powers. “Strings of jeweled necklaces” are the merits of the forty stages, adorning the Dharma‑body above and benefitting beings below. “Myriads of jeweled bells” are the eight tones and four kinds of eloquence. “Fragrance issuing from the four sides” is the path‑wind of the Four Truths blowing the fragrance of the four virtues. “Rising as high as the Palace of the Four Heavenly Kings” means exhausting the principle of the Four Truths.

+
+Below “Thirty‑Three Heavens,” second: the gods’ offerings. The event‑explanation is clear; again it is explained by principle. The thirty minds are thirty; the ten grounds are one; equal‑awakening is one; wondrous‑awakening is one; together they make thirty‑three, all relying on the real‑mark realm. “Raining heavenly mandāra flowers” means the initial mind already possesses the merits of the forty‑two stages, and the later mind also does; all take the causal flowers of the forty stages and dedicate them to the Dharma‑body. “The remaining gods and dragons” are inner and outer ordinary beings and so on, also relying on real‑mark and practicing causes toward the fruit.

+
+Below “At that time, within the jeweled stupa,” third: Many‑Jewels’ praise, directly certifying that the earlier opening of the provisional and revealing of the real is not false. “Equal great wisdom” is precisely the wisdom of all Buddhas, like the earlier meaning of a level and even gait. Equality has two: equality of Dharma, namely the middle‑way principle; and equality of beings, namely that all beings equally obtain Buddha‑wisdom. “Great” is as before, the meaning of height and breadth. In contemplation‑of‑mind: emptiness‑contemplation is vertical equality, provisional‑contemplation is horizontal equality, and middle‑contemplation is both horizontal and vertical equality; equal double illumination is equal great wisdom. “Thus, thus” means: (1) as the Dharma‑marks are, (2) as the root‑capacities are. “All is true” [1]; because it is spoken according to the Dharma‑marks, therefore [2] it says “true.”

+
+Below “At that time the Buddha said,” sixth: the Buddha answers. There are three: first, answering the second question — that Buddha has a vow to certify the Lotus, thus it rises from the ground. Below “That Buddha attained the Way,” he answers the first question: that Buddha ordered this stupa to be built. Next, below “That Buddha by spiritual power,” third, he answers the [3] third question: it issues the sound to certify. The *Treatise* says that Many‑Jewels Buddha did not speak the Dharma and thus entered extinction; the teacher explains otherwise. That Buddha spoke to the bhikṣus; the bhikṣus are those being transformed — how could it be said he did not speak? [4] It should be that Many‑Jewels could open the three but not reveal the real; therefore the *Treatise* says he did not speak the Dharma. For this reason, though he has entered extinction, wherever the *Lotus Sutra* is preached he rejoices and certifies it.

+Below “Great Joy of Preaching, by the Tathāgata’s spiritual power,” second: clarifying the distant gathering of division bodies. This has seven: (1) Great Joy requests to see Many‑Jewels, (2) the Buddha should gather the division bodies, (3) Great Joy requests the gathering, (4) releasing light to summon from afar, (5) all Buddhas come together, (6) purifying the lands, (7) giving consent to open the stupa. Explaining the first request: saying “by relying on the Buddha’s spiritual power” means that to open the stupa one must gather the Buddhas; gathering the Buddhas is entrustment; entrustment is summoning the disciples below; when the disciples below emerge, the near is opened and the far revealed — this is the cause of this great matter; how could it not be the Buddha’s spiritual power that prompts the question? The remaining sections are as in the text. Below “At that time the Buddha emitted light from the white hair‑mark,” fourth: releasing light to summon from afar. The three transformations of the land are due to samādhi, and samādhi has three: the first transforms Saha, which is the back‑rejection that can transform defilement into purity; the second transforms two hundred nayutas, which is the mastery of the sphere of victory; the third transforms another two hundred nayutas, which is the all‑pervading sphere with no obstruction to its object. Again, the first transformation shows purification of the four abodes; the second shows purification of dust‑sand; the third shows purification of ignorance. “At that time the Buddhas sat on lion seats,” seventh: giving consent to open the stupa, again in five: (1) the Buddhas exchange greetings and declare consent, (2) Śākyamuni opens the stupa, (3) the four assemblies all see and hear, (4) the two Buddhas divide the seat and sit, (5) the four assemblies request empowerment. The Buddhas [5] all consent to open the stupa, like the consent in a saṅgha procedure. The *Great Collection* explains that a number of Buddhas consent; the *Huayan* also says Buddhas in the ten directions together speak the *Huayan*; the *Great Prajñā* also says a thousand Buddhas together speak the *Prajñā* — none say they are Śākyamuni’s division bodies; but according to this sutra they should be division bodies. Those sutras are provisional, so at that time they did not explicitly say so. This sutra not only has many, it also directly says they are division bodies and all come to consent. Below “At that time Śākyamuni saw,” second: opening the stupa is opening the provisional; seeing the Buddha is revealing the real; it also certifies what preceded and will open what follows. “Like unfastening a lock” means removing obstruction and moving the capacity. Below “with a great sound,” second: Śākyamuni proclaims and seeks those who will circulate the sutra. This again has three: (1) loudly proclaims the search, (2) below “The Tathāgata will not be long” clarifies the time of entrustment, (3) below “The Buddha wishes to” clarifies that the entrustment has a recipient. “Has a recipient” has two meanings: near — entrusting the eighty‑thousand and twenty‑thousand bodhisattvas who already dwell here to propagate in this land; far — entrusting the original disciples in the thousand‑world dust to propagate everywhere, and thus initiating the lifespan chapter.

+The verses have forty‑eight lines, praising the three meanings above: first three and a half lines praise Many‑Jewels’ extinction; second, eight and a half lines praise the gathering of division bodies; third, thirty‑six lines praise Śākyamuni’s entrustment. The first two are as in the text. Below “Telling the great assembly,” third: again two — first eight and a half lines, presenting the three Buddhas to exhort circulation; second, twenty‑seven and a half lines, presenting the difficulty of holding the Dharma to exhort circulation. In the first there are three: first one and a half lines seek the person; next, below “That Many‑Jewels,” second: three lines, directly present the three Buddhas to exhort holding the sutra; next, below “If there is one able to protect,” third: four lines — if one can hold this sutra, it is to make offerings to and see the three Buddhas, explaining the exhortation. Below “Good men,” second: twenty‑seven and a half lines, presenting the difficulty of holding the Dharma to exhort circulation, again in two: first twenty lines, directly exhort; second, seven and a half lines, explain the exhortation. In the first there are three: first one line, admonishing; next, below “All other sutras,” second: seventeen lines, directly presenting difficulty to exhort circulation. Below “After I, for the Buddha‑way,” third: two lines explain the difficulty; if one can hold it, one holds the Buddha’s body — how easy could that be? Second, below “Good men, I, in,” seven and a half lines clarify that being able to hold what is hard to hold produces superior virtue, thus explaining the exhortation. Within that again three: first one and a half lines, re‑seeking those who hold the sutra; next, below “This sutra is hard to hold,” second: one and a half lines, clarifying that if one can hold what is hard to hold, the Buddhas rejoice and praise; next, below “This is then courageous,” third: four and a half lines, clarifying that holding the hard‑to‑hold is to accomplish superior practices — superior practices have self and others. “World of fear” is in India called *sabhaya*; in Chinese it is “fear.” In India it is called *bhadra*; in Chinese it is “Worthy Kalpa” (only a name).

+The *Baochang Catalogue* says: “The *Lotus* has four translations: two survive, two are lost. Dharmarakṣa (in Chinese, Fa‑hu), translated at Chang’an in the Western Jin, named *Zheng Fahua*. [7] Fa‑hu further expanded it; this is what An and Tai transmitted. Kumārajīva, translated as ‘Child‑Longevity,’ a person of Kucha, in the Later Qin Hongshi fifth year, fourth month, twenty‑third day, at Chang’an’s Xiaoyao Garden, completed the translation of the *Mahāprajñā*; by the eighth year in summer, at Caotang Temple he translated this *Wonderful Lotus*, commissioning Seng‑rui to lecture on it. Rui opened it into nine ruts; at that time there were twenty‑eight chapters, but palace people at Chang’an requested this chapter and it was kept inside, so the Jiangdong transmission only had twenty‑seven chapters. In the Liang there was Master Man who lectured on the sutra one [8] hundred times and burned his body in Changsha; he placed this chapter before the *Upholding* chapter — his own private arrangement not known in the realm. In the Chen there was Master Nanyue, who placed this chapter after the *Jeweled Stupa*; later he checked it against the *Zheng Fahua* and it matched well. Now [1] the four streams are mixed; seeing the old Chang’an recension, we know the two masters deeply grasped the sutra’s intent.” Devadatta is also called Datou; it is translated as “heavenly heat.” He split the saṅgha and took five hundred bhikṣus away; Śāriputra disliked him. When they slept, Maudgalyāyana carried the assembly back; upon waking, he swore to repay this enmity. He lifted a stone thirty cubits long and fifteen cubits wide and threw it at the Buddha; a mountain‑spirit’s hand blocked it, and a small stone splinter wounded the Buddha’s foot so blood flowed. He instructed King Ajātaśatru to release a drunken elephant to trample the Buddha; he killed the nun Utpalavarṇā; he smeared poison on ten nails to bow to the Buddha’s feet and wounded the Buddha — these are the five heinous crimes. If counted as three heinous crimes, the king‑instruction and poisoned nails are included in harming the Buddha. Because he should perform contrary deeds, when he was born humans and gods were hot‑hearted; from this he got his name, thus “heavenly heat” — this is the trace. If explained at the origin, beings have afflictions, so the bodhisattva [2] manifests heat, sharing their illness‑conduct to liberate them. The intent of this chapter is to cite ancient propagation and show its benefit is not false, to clarify that present teaching has proven efficacy, and to use the past to exhort the present to circulate it. The text has two: (1) up to “born from a lotus before the Buddha,” clarifies past Devadatta transmitting the sutra and Śākyamuni attaining Buddhahood; (2) from “at that time the bodhisattvas from below in Many‑Jewels’ place” down, clarifies present Mañjuśrī transmitting the sutra and the dragon girl becoming Buddha; if even those who receive the teaching are so, how could the benefit of propagating be not great! Therefore Devadatta receives prediction; Mañjuśrī can be known by intent (etc.).

+Below “Telling the bhikṣus, the king...” second: concluding past and present, again in two: (1) directly concluding past and present, as in the text; (2) below “Because of Devadatta,” clarifying that both teacher and disciple’s merit and reward are complete. Within the completion there are two: first clarifying that the disciple’s causal reward is complete; second, below “The Buddha told the four assemblies,” clarifying that the Dharma‑teacher’s wondrous fruit will be accomplished. Within the disciple section there are three: first clarifying the cause completed; next, below “Thirty‑two marks,” clarifying the fruit completed; last, below “All because of Devadatta,” concluding that the benefit is due to the one who transmitted the sutra. First, “complete the six pāramitās”: the meanings of pāramitā are many. The *Great Treatise* says: abandoning the dependent and the dependent‑recompense is dāna; preventing the seven branches is precepts; being beaten and cursed without retaliation is patience; carrying things through from start to finish is diligence; the four dhyānas and eight samādhis are meditation; dividing stages and ceasing disputes is prajñā. Again, if one bundles the ten good acts into six: not killing through not lying are dāna; not double‑tongue is śīla; not harsh speech is patience; not frivolous speech is diligence; not greed and not anger are meditation; not wrong view is prajñā. The *Bodhisattva Good Precepts*, fascicle 10, says: “The six pāramitās are of three kinds: (1) as antidotes, namely to stinginess, evil, anger, laziness, chaos, and delusion (etc.); (2) as mutually generating: abandoning home and keeping precepts, meeting insult and needing patience, patience then leading to diligence, diligence then regulating the five roots, the roots regulated then knowing the dharma‑realm; (3) as fruits: wealth, color, strength, longevity, peace, and eloquence.” Other sutras say: giving yields wealth; precepts yield good destinies; patience yields uprightness; diligence yields supernatural powers; meditation yields rebirth in heaven; wisdom yields the breaking of afflictions. Such examples are the Tripiṭaka teaching’s explanation of the six pāramitās. If giving, recipient, and thing are all empty, it is called dāna; not seeing keeping or breaking is called precepts; the patient and the object of patience being unobtainable is called patience; body and mind unmoved is called diligence; not scattered and not savoring is called meditation; neither wise nor foolish is called prajñā — this pattern is the Common teaching’s six pāramitās. If one says that dāna has ten benefits: [7] subduing the stingy affliction, continuity of the giving mind, sharing resources with beings, being born in a wealthy house, in each life the giving mind appears, the four assemblies love and respect, in the crowd one is not timid, a superior name spreads everywhere, hands and feet are soft, up to reaching the site of awakening and constantly meeting good friends. Precepts have ten benefits: fulfilling all‑knowledge as the Buddha learned it, not being destroyed by the wise, vows not退, abiding in practice, abandoning birth‑and‑death and yearning for nirvāṇa, obtaining an un‑entangled mind, obtaining superior samādhi, and not lacking faith‑treasure. Patience has ten benefits: fire, blades, poison, and water cannot harm; non‑humans guard one; the body‑marks are adorned; it closes the evil paths and is born in Brahmā heaven; day and night are always at ease; the body never leaves joy. Diligence has ten benefits: others cannot subdue one; one is protected by the Buddha; non‑humans guard one; one does not forget what is heard; what is not heard can be heard; eloquence grows; one obtains samādhi‑nature; few illnesses and troubles; food is easily digested, like the uḍumbara flower’s increase. Meditation has ten benefits: abiding in proper deportment and practicing the慈境界; no remorse‑heat; guarding the faculties; obtaining joy without food; departing desire and cultivating meditation without emptiness; being freed from the māra‑net and abiding in the Buddha‑realm; liberation becomes [8] mature. Prajñā has ten benefits: not grasping the marks of giving; not relying on precepts; not abiding in patience‑power; [9] not departing body‑mind diligence; meditation has nowhere to abide and māras cannot disturb; others’ words cannot move one; one reaches the bottom of birth‑and‑death and gives rise to superior慈; one does not delight in the two‑vehicle ground. Four things should be practiced for dāna: (1) practitioners destroy stinginess; (2) to adorn bodhi; (3) self‑and‑other benefit — when one wishes to give, gives, and after giving rejoices, this is self‑benefit; when the hungry and thirsty are relieved, this is benefit to others; (4) to obtain great good fruit in future lives, gaining great honor and abundant wealth. Four things should be practiced for precepts: self‑cultivating good dharmas and extinguishing evil; precepts adorn bodhi and gather beings; in lying or waking one is at ease, has no [10] regret, and has no harmful mind toward beings; afterward one receives human and heavenly joy and nirvāṇa, etc. Four things should be practiced for patience: cultivating patience removes non‑patience; adorning bodhi and gathering beings; both sides depart fear; in future lives there is no anger, kin are not destroyed, and one does not receive suffering, gaining human and heavenly nirvāṇa‑joy. Four things should be practiced for diligence: diligence breaks laziness; adorns bodhi and gathers beings; increasing good dharmas is self‑benefit; not troubling others is benefit to others; afterward one gains great power and reaches bodhi. Four things should be practiced for meditation: meditation breaks a scattered mind; adorns bodhi and gathers beings; body and mind are tranquil as self‑benefit; not troubling beings is benefit to others; afterward one receives a pure body, is at ease, and gains nirvāṇa. Four things should be practiced for prajñā: wisdom breaks ignorance; adorns bodhi and gathers beings; wisdom‑joy is self‑benefit; teaching beings is benefit to others; it can destroy afflictions and wisdom‑obstructions and is a great fruit. Such patterns are the Distinct teaching’s six pāramitās. The *Moon‑Storehouse* (fascicle 1) says: “If beings only rely on reading and recitation to seek bodhi, they are attached to the worldly; they still cannot tame their own afflictions, how could they tame others? Such a person clings to jealousy, fame, profit, wealth, and honor, is high‑minded, self‑righteous, and lightly slanders others. They still cannot obtain wholesome roots of the desire realm, much less wholesome roots of form and formless, much less two‑vehicle bodhi, much less unsurpassed bodhi. It is like star‑fire cannot dry the sea, breath cannot move a mountain, lotus‑threads cannot weigh a peak. Why? The worldly cannot fulfill bodhi. What is the first‑principle? It is making all meritorious acts: if one cultivates body, mind, and wisdom, perfuming them with the first principle, then one quickly fulfills the six pāramitās. Whether walking or sitting, abandoning clinging thoughts is dāna; abandoning clinging and not violating is śīla; not raising sores in境界 is kṣānti; not abandoning separation is diligence; not being lax in affairs is meditation; the nature of all dharmas being unborn is prajñā. Again: regarding the skandhas, abandoning is dāna; not counting and thinking the skandhas is śīla; not‑self thoughts about the skandhas is kṣānti; raising resentment toward the skandhas is diligence; the skandhas not blazing is meditation; the skandhas being ultimately abandoned is prajñā. Regarding the realms: abandoning is dāna; not being turbulent in the realms is śīla; abandoning causal conditions in the realms is kṣānti; repeatedly abandoning in the realms is diligence; not giving rise in the realms is meditation; like幻 in the realms is prajñā. Such are called the profound dharma‑essentials of first‑principle skillful means, which can fulfill the six pāramitās.” Using this Dharma for self and others, bodhisattvas of the three times all cultivate it to achieve bodhi; therefore it is not worldly. This Dharma can still the afflictions‑path and suffering‑path of beings and place them on the bodhi path. The *Huayan* explains that on the seventh ground, in every thought one fully possesses and cultivates all Buddha‑dharmas with the ten pāramitās: seeking the Buddha‑path’s good roots for all beings is dāna; extinguishing the heat of all afflictions is śīla; not harming any beings is patience; seeking good without weariness is diligence; cultivating the path‑mind without scattering and always oriented to all‑wisdom is meditation; enduring the gate of non‑arising of all dharmas is prajñā; being able to raise immeasurable wisdom‑gates is skillful means; seeking to turn supreme wisdom is vow; māras and wrongs cannot阻 is power; speaking the marks of all dharmas as they truly are is knowledge. Because the ten pāramitās are complete, the four摄, the path factors, the three liberations, and all aids to bodhi are all complete in every thought; all grounds are complete in every thought; because this ground is superior. Such examples are the Perfect teaching’s six pāramitās.

+
+Next, below “Thirty‑two marks,” it clarifies the fruit’s completeness. “Thirty‑two marks”: [1] flat feet like the bottom of a chest, insteps raised like a turtle’s back — the two marks cultivated together through firm giving; the thousand‑spoked wheel is cultivated alone through comforting the fearful; long heels, long fingers and toes, and a round, straight body — three marks cultivated together through the precept of not killing; the seven places full, shoulders, neck, arms, and legs — cultivated together by constantly being a giver; webbed hands and feet and softness — two marks cultivated together by the four摄; straight heels, hidden ankles, and right‑curling hair — three marks cultivated together by always benefiting beings with善法; the [A2] deer‑leg and calf mark is cultivated alone by teaching people with scriptures without stinginess; the skin that does not take dust is cultivated alone by answering when asked; the golden‑color mark is cultivated alone by patience and giving good clothes; the hidden‑horse mark is cultivated alone by reconciling disputes; the梵 body’s roundness and the hand reaching the knees [2] are cultivated together by teaching with慈‑equal minds; rounded shoulders,光 at the nape, and lion’s chest — three marks cultivated together by always increasing others’ giving; the swastika mark is cultivated alone by not harming beings; dark‑blue eyes and ox‑king eyelashes — two marks cultivated together by regarding beings without anger or attachment; top‑knot and青 hair — two marks cultivated together by putting all merits before others; one pore, one hair, and the白毫 — two marks cultivated together by not lying; forty teeth and even white teeth — two marks cultivated together by not double‑tongue; broad long tongue and梵 voice — two marks cultivated together by not coarse speech; lion’s cheeks cultivated alone by not frivolous speech; four fangs cultivated alone by leaving wrong livelihood. The merit of all beings equals one hair of the Buddha; the merit of the Buddha’s hairs equals one “good”; all goods equal one mark; all marks equal the white‑tuft and flesh‑topknot; the white‑tuft and flesh‑topknot, over hundreds of thousands of millions, then become the梵 voice. Though the causes of the thirty‑two marks are each distinct, as for their true cause: precepts and diligence — without diligence or precepts one does not even obtain a human or heavenly body, much less the other marks. This is the Tripiṭaka teaching’s basis for marks. “Emptiness and non‑arising” is the Common teaching’s basis; “knowledge of the path‑seeds” is the Distinct teaching’s basis; “real‑mark” is the Perfect teaching’s basis. “Eighty kinds of secondary marks”: twenty for the inside and outside of fingers and toes; eight for the level fullness of eight places; six for ankles, knees, and thighs; six for wonderful shoulders, elbows, and wrists; three for the two hips and the奇中; one for hips and buttocks and the hidden‑horse; two for the two shoulder‑blades and two for the腰‑alignment; six for the ribs, armpits, and乳; four for abdomen, chest, back, and nape; upper and lower teeth, upper and lower lips and palate; two cheeks, two temples, two eyes, two eyebrows; two nostrils, forehead, two [𮌋], two ears, and the head’s roundness. If one distinguishes the meanings of the four kinds of secondary marks, the correlations can be known.

+Below “The Buddha told the bhikṣus,” third: exhorting cultivation, as in the text. “Born from a lotus” — the *Embryo Sūtra* says, “Those born from a lotus are not the transformational birth among胎,卵,濕,化”; they are called “transformational” but are not the same as the transformational birth among the four. The *Asking Avalokiteśvara* says, “Lotus‑born take the lotus as father and mother.” The *Contemplation of Infinite Life* says, “Those who dwell long on the lotus pedestal are called胎‑born; it is not actual胎‑birth. By analogy, lotus‑born are also called濕 or卵, but are not濕 or卵” (etc.).

+
+“At that time, from below” is second: clarifying Mañjuśrī’s present‑day benefit in transmitting the sutra, again in two: first clarifying Mañjuśrī’s transmission; second, from “Mañjuśrī said, I, in the sea” downward, clarifying the benefit. The first has five: (1) clarifying that Zhiji (Wisdom‑Accumulation) requests to leave. The *Pundarīka Sūtra* says, “The bodhisattva from the Buddha‑land below is named Prajñā‑[3]kulā; in Chinese, Wisdom‑Accumulation.” (2) Below “Śākyamuni,” clarifying that the World‑Honored One stops him and orders him to wait for proof of the benefit of transmitting the sutra. Zhiji said: Many‑Jewels came to certify the sutra; once exhorting circulation is done, he requests to return. Śākyamuni stops him: though trace‑gate matters are complete, the original gate is not yet manifest, so he entrusts it to Mañjuśrī to keep Many‑Jewels; the Buddha’s secret intent is not known to bodhisattvas. (3) From “At that time Mañjuśrī” downward: Mañjuśrī soon arrives. (4) Below “Bodhisattva Zhiji”: Zhiji asks how many he has transformed [4]. (5) Below “Mañjuśrī said”: Mañjuśrī answers that it is not宣 by mouth. Within the fifth there are seven: (1) he answers that the benefit is very great. (2) Below “What was said has not yet…”: those who received benefit gather as proof. (3) Below “These bodhisattvas”: they are all transformed by Mañjuśrī. (4) Below “Originally śrāvaka persons”: originally they received the provisional teaching and dwelled in the two‑vehicle path. The *Pundarīka Sūtra* says: “Lotus flowers that emerge from a pond originally aroused the bodhisattva mind; their flowers in空 speak Mahāyāna matters. Those who originally aroused the śrāvaka mind have flowers in空 that only speak of cutting off birth and death.” (5) Below “Now all cultivate and practice”: now hearing the real teaching, all abide in Mahāyāna Dharma. (6) Below “Mañjuśrī said to Zhiji”: Mañjuśrī concludes the benefit. (7) Below “At that time”: Zhiji’s verses praise [1].

+從「文殊言我於海中」下，第二，明利益。文為九：一、文殊自敘，二、智積問，三、答，四、智積執別教為疑，五、龍女明圓釋疑，六、身子挾三藏權難，七、龍女以一實除疑，八、時眾聞見得益，九、智積身子默然信伏。第五，龍女明圓釋疑：初、經敘現申敬。次有三行半偈，為三：初半行，明持經得解；次二行，明成就二身；後一行，引佛為證。「罪福」者，約七方便傳作，今偈深達無罪無福入一實相，名為「深達」也。「十方」即十法界，同以實慧朗之，故言「遍照」也。「具三十二相」者，深得法身之理即備相好，如《大品》明：欲得一切法當學般若，如得如意珠也，二乘但得空，空無相好也(云云)。第六，身子復難，先總難信，後釋出五礙。第七，龍女現成明證，復二：一者獻珠表得圓解。圓珠表其修得圓因，奉佛是將因剋果，佛受疾者獲果速也，此即一念坐道場，成佛不虛也。二正示因圓果滿。《胎經》云「魔梵釋女皆不捨身不受身，悉於現身得成佛故」。偈言「法性如大海，不說有是非，凡夫賢聖人，平等無高下，唯在心垢滅，取證如反掌」。第八，「爾時娑婆」下，明時眾見聞，復二：先、明見聞；二、人天歡喜，彼此蒙益。南方緣熟宜以八相成道，此土緣薄[＊10-2]秖以龍女教化，此是權巧之力。得一身一切身，普現色身三昧也。
+
+From “Mañjuśrī said, I in the sea” downward, second: clarifying the benefit. The text has nine: (1) Mañjuśrī’s self‑statement, (2) Zhiji’s question, (3) answer, (4) Zhiji’s doubt based on the Distinct teaching, (5) the dragon girl clarifies the Perfect teaching to resolve doubt, (6) Śāriputra, holding the Tripiṭaka’s provisional view, raises difficulties, (7) the dragon girl uses the One‑Real to remove doubt, (8) the assembly sees and hears and gains benefit, (9) Zhiji and Śāriputra silently believe and submit. In the fifth, the dragon girl clarifies the Perfect teaching to resolve doubt: first, the sutra narrates her appearing and expressing reverence. Next there are three and a half lines of verse, in three: first half‑line clarifies understanding gained by holding the sutra; next two lines clarify accomplishing the two bodies; last line cites the Buddha as proof. “Merit and demerit”: in the seven expedients it is transmitted as such; now the verse deeply reaches no‑merit and no‑demerit entering the One‑Real, named “deep reach.” “Ten directions” are the ten dharma‑realms, all illumined by real wisdom, hence “pervading illumination.” “Complete the thirty‑two marks” means: deeply obtaining the principle of the Dharma‑body is to possess the marks, as the *Mahāprajñā* explains: if one wishes to obtain all dharmas, one should study prajñā, like obtaining a wish‑fulfilling jewel; the two vehicles only obtain emptiness, and emptiness has no marks (etc.). Sixth, Śāriputra again raises difficulties: first generally doubting, then explaining the five obstacles. Seventh, the dragon girl manifests immediate attainment to prove: again in two — first, she offers the jewel to indicate complete understanding. The round jewel shows she has cultivated the perfect cause; offering it to the Buddha is bringing cause to complete fruit; the Buddha receives it swiftly, thus the fruit is obtained swiftly; this is immediate seating at the path‑site, attainment of Buddhahood is not false. Second, she directly shows cause complete and fruit full. The *Embryo Sūtra* says: “The daughters of māras, Brahmā, and Śakra do not abandon the body or receive another body; all attain Buddhahood in the present body.” The verse says: “Dharma‑nature is like the great sea; it does not speak of is or is‑not. Ordinary and sage persons are equal with no high or low. Only when the mind’s defilements are extinguished is realization taken as quickly as turning the palm.” Eighth, below “At that time Saha…”: clarifying that the assembly sees and hears; again in two: first, seeing and hearing; second, humans and gods rejoice, both sides gain benefit. The southern land has mature affinities and is suited for eight‑phase Buddhahood; this land’s affinities are weak, [＊10‑2] thus only the dragon girl teaches here — this is the power of expedient skill. Obtaining one body and all bodies, universally manifesting a form‑body samādhi.

+
+---
+二萬菩薩奉命弘經，故名「持品」；重勸八十萬億那由他弘經，故名「勸持品」。
+
+Twenty thousand bodhisattvas receive the command to propagate the sutra, thus it is called the “Upholding Chapter”; again it exhorts eighty thousand koṭis of nayutas to propagate the sutra, thus it is called the “Exhorting to Uphold Chapter.”

+
+The twenty thousand are the number of those separately commanded in the first section of the “Dharma Teacher” chapter, so they receive the Buddha’s order to uphold. The eighty thousand koṭis of nayutas had no separate command before, only a general seeking. Now the Buddha gazes with his eyes and has them vow to propagate the sutra in this land; such propagation proves and manifests the Buddha’s deep and earnest intent. Therefore they are exhorted and propagate — thus there are two meanings.

+第二勸持，有長行、偈頌。長行有五：一、佛眼視，二、菩薩請告，三、佛默[2]然，四、菩薩知意，五、發誓通經。眼視默勸而不告言者，上來雖不別命，而舉持經功德深厚引證分明，多寶分身遠來勸發，此之殷勤事義已足，有欲應命宜即發誓無[3]煩復言，又將護聲聞他方之願故不稱揚也。偈有二十行請護持經，不復細分，尋文可解。前十七行，被忍衣弘經；次第二，一行，入室弘經；次第三，一行，坐座弘經；次第四，一行，總結請[4]加。《中阿含》第六云「阿蘭若此翻無事，頭陀此翻[5]抖擻。」《寶雲經》第六云「阿練兒處比丘，見王王子婆羅門及一切人來，比丘唱善來可就此坐，彼即共坐，彼不坐比丘亦不坐，當為說法令歡喜。」佛滅後末惡世不應式比丘，雖說戒法而得活，而於戒法不樂行，歷五分法身，餘一切道法亦如是，說如齆鼻人說栴檀[6]自既無香亦不自聞，天人、龍神、鳩槃[7]茶終不供養無戒人，餘四分亦如是說，無有[8]能將妙法來，必由淨戒之所起，餘四亦如是。若遇垂死最重病，痛惱逼迫極無[9]瘳，念佛三昧常不捨，一切苦切奪其心，彼人自解是法故，則知一切諸法空。「忍辱鎧」者，《中阿含》第五云「黑齒比丘訴佛云：『舍利弗罵我說我。』佛疾喚舍利弗。『實罵說不？』舍利弗言：『心不定者或說罵，我心已定云何說罵？如折角牛不觸嬈人，如殘童子恥不惱彼，我心如地水火風，淨與不淨大小便利涕唾受而不罵，心如掃箒，淨不淨俱掃，又如破器盛脂置之日中，渧渧恒漏，自觀九孔常漏不淨，云何罵說於他？又如死蛇狗等繫淨童子頸，慚恥自愧不罵說他。』佛問：『如是惡人汝云何觀？』答：『人有五：一、身善、口意[10]不善，但念其善不念不善，如納衣比丘見糞聚弊帛，左捉右舒，截棄不淨而取於淨，念用其身淨以規我身，棄其口意以誡我口意。又口行淨、身意不淨，亦念其口、棄其身意，如熱渴者值多草池披草掬水涼身止渴。又意淨、身口不淨，亦念其意、不用其身口，如行路熱渴唯牛跡少水，我若用掬若手水則渾濁，應兩膝跪兩手憑口就吸之以除熱渴。又三業皆不淨者，雖無可用當痛念之，如路見病人安置使穩，念此不淨使得值善知識治其三業，勿令墮落三途。又三種皆淨，常念是人以自訓況，念齊願齊，如清涼池多諸花草，熱渴入中以自蘇息，常念境界以去我惡。』」此是三藏教中用苦、無常、不淨、無我、空為鎧也。《毘婆沙》第八云「念罵是一語，餘皆喚聲，終日喚聲於我何為？又此方是卑陋語，他方是稱讚語，我若念此卑語，無處得樂。又觀此字罵，若顛倒此字即成讚。又罵是一界少分，一入少分，一陰少分，罵少不罵多。又誰成就罵，罵者成就，成就自彼，於我何為？又罵是一字，一字不成罵，二字成罵，無有一時稱二字者，若稱後字，前字已滅。又能罵所罵一時，同一剎那俱滅，於我何為？」如是等用空為鎧也。十七云「凡聖俱有三受，云何差別？凡夫於苦受有二：一、身受苦，二、心受憂悲，如三毒箭，失樂則瞋、得樂則喜、不苦不樂則癡；聖人但有身受而無心受，於苦不瞋、於樂不愛、於不苦不樂不癡，三使不能使，於使得解脫，故有凡聖之異。」如此等有無差降者，此用別教為鎧也。今經明鎧者，以念佛為鎧，是念法佛第一義，佛即是法故。文云念佛告勅即法也，佛即是僧，僧即事理俱和，[1]毘盧遮那遍一切處也，如此之鎧，一鎧一切鎧，即圓教鎧也。

+Second, the exhortation to uphold has prose and verse. The prose has five: (1) the Buddha gazes with his eyes, (2) the bodhisattvas ask for instruction, (3) the Buddha is [2] silent, (4) the bodhisattvas know his intent, (5) they vow to propagate the sutra. The Buddha’s gazing and silent exhortation without spoken instruction means: above, though there was no separate command, the profound merit of holding the sutra has been lifted and proven clearly; Many‑Jewels and the division bodies came from afar to exhort and arouse; the earnestness of this matter is sufficient. Those who wish to accept the command should vow immediately without [3] repeated words; moreover, he protects the śrāvakas’ vows for other lands and thus does not praise them. The verse has twenty lines requesting protection of those who uphold the sutra; it is not further subdivided — follow the text. The first seventeen lines are about propagating the sutra by wearing the armor of patience; the next, the second, one line, is propagating by entering the room; the next, the third, one line, is propagating by sitting on the seat; the next, the fourth, one line, is a general conclusion requesting [4] empowerment. The *Middle Āgama* (fascicle 6) says, “Araṇya is translated as ‘no matters’; dhūta is translated as [5] ‘shaking off’.” The *Bao‑yun Sūtra* (fascicle 6) says, “A bhikṣu in an āraṇya place, seeing kings, princes, brahmins, and all people come, the bhikṣu chants ‘welcome, you may sit here.’ They then sit together; if they do not sit, the bhikṣu also does not sit; he should speak Dharma to gladden them.” After the Buddha’s extinction, in the final evil age, one should not be a model bhikṣu: though one speaks the precepts and obtains livelihood, one does not delight in practicing the precepts. Through the five parts of the Dharma‑body, the rest of all path‑dharmas are likewise: it is like a snuffling‑nose person speaking of sandalwood — [6] he himself has no fragrance and does not smell it himself. Gods, humans, dragons, and kumbhāṇḍas will never make offerings to a preceptless person. The remaining four parts are likewise; there is no [8] one who can bring the wondrous Dharma — it must arise from pure precepts, and the other four are likewise. If one encounters a most severe illness near death, with pain and distress pressing to the point of no [9] cure, if one constantly does not abandon the Buddha‑samādhi, all suffering cuts off the mind; because that person himself understands this Dharma, he then knows that all dharmas are empty. “Armor of patience”: the *Middle Āgama* (fascicle 5) says, “Bhikṣu Kālaka complained to the Buddha, saying, ‘Śāriputra cursed me and spoke ill of me.’ The Buddha quickly summoned Śāriputra: ‘Did you in fact curse him?’ Śāriputra said, ‘Those whose minds are unsettled may curse; my mind is settled, how could I curse? Like an ox with broken horns that does not gore, like a crippled child ashamed and not harming others, my mind is like earth, water, fire, and wind: it receives clean and unclean, large and small, feces and spittle, without cursing. My mind is like a broom: clean and unclean are both swept. Again, like a broken vessel filled with fat set in the sun, drip by drip it constantly leaks; I contemplate the nine apertures constantly leaking impurity — how could I curse others? Again, like a dead snake or dog tied around a clean child’s neck, ashamed and abashed, he does not curse others.’ The Buddha asked, ‘How do you view such evil people?’ He answered, ‘There are five kinds of persons: (1) body good, mouth and mind [10] not good — only think of their goodness and not their non‑good, like a robe‑gathering bhikṣu who sees a heap of filth and torn cloth, takes the right and left, cuts off the unclean and takes the clean, and uses the clean of his body to regulate my body, discarding his mouth and mind to warn my mouth and mind. (2) mouth conduct clean, body and mind unclean — also think of his mouth and discard his body and mind, like a hot and thirsty person who meets a grassy pond, pushes aside the grass and scoops water to cool the body and stop thirst. (3) mind clean, body and mouth unclean — also think of his mind and do not use his body and mouth, like a traveler hot and thirsty who finds only a little water in an ox‑hoofprint; if he uses a scoop or hand, it becomes muddy, so he should kneel on both knees, bring both hands to his mouth, and drink to relieve thirst. (4) all three karmas unclean — though there is nothing to use, one should pity and念 him, like seeing a sick person on the road, arranging him to be stable, thinking of his impurity so that he may meet good friends to heal his three karmas and not fall into the three bad paths. (5) all three are clean — always think of this person to instruct and compare oneself, aligning one’s thoughts and vows; like a cool pond with many flowers and grasses, the hot and thirsty enter it to revive themselves, always念 the境界 to remove my evils.’” This is the Tripiṭaka teaching using suffering, impermanence, impurity, no‑self, and emptiness as armor. The *Vibhāṣā* (fascicle 8) says: “Thinking ‘cursing’ is one word; the rest are all summons. If all day they summon, what is it to me? Again, here it is a base word, elsewhere it is a word of praise; if I念 this base word, there is nowhere I can find joy. Again, observe the word ‘curse’: if you invert the word, it becomes praise. Again, cursing is a small part of one realm, one entrance, one skandha; the cursing is small and the non‑cursing is much. Again, who accomplishes the curse? The curser accomplishes it; the accomplishment is on his side — what is it to me? Again, cursing is one word; one word does not make a curse, two words make a curse; there is no time when two words are spoken at once; if one speaks the latter word, the former has already ceased. Again, the one who curses and the one cursed are in one time, the same instant, and both cease — what is it to me?” Such is using emptiness as armor. Fascicle seventeen says: “Both ordinary and sage have three feelings. How do they differ? The ordinary have two in painful feeling: bodily pain and mental sorrow, like three poison‑arrows. Losing pleasure they become angry, gaining pleasure they rejoice, neither‑pain‑nor‑pleasure they are deluded. The sage has only bodily feeling and no mental feeling; toward pain he does not get angry, toward pleasure he does not cling, toward neither he is not deluded; the three afflictors cannot afflict him; he is liberated from the afflictors. Thus there is the difference of ordinary and sage.” Such differences of having and not having are using the Distinct teaching as armor. Now this sutra clarifies armor as “mindfulness of the Buddha is armor”: this is mindfulness of the Dharma‑Buddha of first principle; the Buddha is the Dharma. The text says: mindfulness of the Buddha and his exhortation is the Dharma; the Buddha is the saṅgha; the saṅgha is the harmony of事 and理; [1] Vairocana pervades all places. Such armor — one armor is all armors — is the Perfect teaching’s armor.

+
+This chapter is explained in three: by events, by attaching to the text, and by the Dharma‑gate. By events: the body has no danger, thus “peace”; the mind has no忧惱, thus “joy”; body and mind at peace and joy, thus it can advance in practice. By attaching to the text: wearing the Tathāgata’s robe makes the Dharma‑body peaceful; entering the Tathāgata’s room makes the mind joyful in liberation; sitting on the Tathāgata’s seat means prajñā guides the practice’s advance — this is explanation attached to the previous chapter’s text. Dwelling on the ground of patience makes the body peaceful; not being sudden or violent makes the mind joyful; contemplating the real‑mark of all dharmas makes practice advance. By the Dharma‑gate: peace is “not moving,” joy is “non‑reception,” practice is “non‑practice.” Not‑moving means that birth‑and‑death of the six paths and the nirvāṇa of the two sages cannot move it; since it does not cling to the two extremes, the body has no movement. The prior text says, “Body and limbs are calm and unmoving; the mind is always still and never scattered”; thus it abides in the not‑moving gate like the peak of Sumeru. Joy means it does not receive the vast functions of samādhi, does not receive the five feelings of ordinary people; even in the Perfect teaching the five feelings that give rise to views are not received. If there is reception, there is suffering; if there is no reception, there is no suffering; no suffering and no joy is called great joy. Non‑practice: if there is reception there is practice; if no reception there is no practice — it does not practice the ordinary person’s practice, nor the sage’s practice; therefore it is called non‑practice, yet it practices the middle way; hence it is named “practice” and is the Dharma‑gate. Now further explanation by events: peaceful practice is great nirvāṇa, named from the fruit; practice is the path to nirvāṇa, named from the cause. Other causes and fruits are both suffering: the eternalist outsiders practice苦行 and obtain苦果; or the cause is pleasure and the fruit is suffering, like the annihilationist outsiders indulging pleasure and later gaining苦報; or the cause is苦 and the fruit is樂, like the analytical two vehicles with impermanent clumsy deliverance, who only enter nirvāṇa after painful exertion. Now peaceful practice is cause and fruit both joyful — this is the *Mahāprajñā*’s skillful crossing as such. The *Great Sutra* says: “Those who definitely practice苦行 are ordinary people; those who practice苦樂 are śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas; those who definitely practice樂行 are bodhisattvas.” The seven expedients’ coarse causes and coarse fruits are all not peaceful practice; only this wondrous cause and wondrous fruit are called peaceful practice. Further explaining by the text: peaceful practice is the nirvāṇa path. Nirvāṇa has three meanings, namely the secret treasury of the three virtues; practice has three meanings, namely cessation‑practice, contemplation‑practice, and compassion‑practice. Cessation‑practice: the three karmas, gentle and compliant, are all quiet — this is the Dharma‑body practice, i.e., the Tathāgata’s robe above. Contemplation‑practice: the one real‑mark wisdom with non‑discriminating light — this is prajñā practice, i.e., the Tathāgata’s seat above. Compassion‑practice: the four vast vows widely deliver all — this is liberation practice, i.e., the Tathāgata’s room above. Gathering these three practices as the nirvāṇa path, and taking the three virtues as the境 of practice, the境 is called peaceful and the path is called practice. The *Great Treatise* says: “From first arousing the mind, the bodhisattva always contemplates nirvāṇa and practices the path; at the causal stage he uses these three practices, guiding the three karmas as practice. When the three karmas are pure, this is purity of the six roots; when the six roots are pure, a likeness‑understanding arises and one enters the real; at the fruit stage it is called the Buddha’s eyes and ears, etc.” The cause is called cessation‑practice, the fruit is called the virtue of cutting off; the cause is called contemplation‑practice, the fruit is the virtue of wisdom; the cause is compassion‑practice, the fruit is the virtue of grace. Again, the cause is three karmas, the fruit is three mysteries; in the causal stage compassion guides the three karmas to benefit others, in the fruit stage it is the three wheels of inconceivable transformation. In such contemplation there is no further discrimination: in all [2] dharmas there is peaceful‑joy nature; all beings are great nirvāṇa and cannot be further extinguished; practicing the non‑path, one通 to the Buddha‑path — this is the absolute explanation of peaceful practice, and this practice accords with nirvāṇa‑meaning. That text also says there is another practice that is the Tathāgata‑practice: the Tathāgata is the person, peaceful‑joy is the Dharma; the Tathāgata is the peaceful person, peaceful‑joy is the Tathāgata‑Dharma — in general the meaning is not different, and in distinction it is also not different. This clarifies that the quiescent‑extinction patience is the Dharma‑empty seat and the Tathāgata’s room; that text clarifies golden and silver jeweled trees — jeweled trees are the forest of non‑outflow jewels; the non‑outflow aligns with the empty quiescent‑extinction patience; the golden sand great river entering the western sea aligns with the one real wisdom and the emptiness of all dharmas; women attaining the path means no flattery or曲 — this aligns the unconditioned great [3] compassion with the Tathāgata’s room; they call it the meaning of no remainder; here it is called the unsurpassed path. Again, the meaning of the five practices also matches the robe, seat, and room.

+The *Great Sutra* leans toward subduing, dwelling on the “one‑son ground”; how could it lack receiving and gathering? This sutra leans toward receiving and gathering; “head‑broken into seven parts” is not without subduing. Each raises one end as suited to the time; in principle all four must be present. What are the four? “Suited to the time and fitting” is the world‑intention; receiving and gathering is the intention for persons; subduing is the intention for治; awakening to the path is the first‑principle intention.

+
+In the broad explanation of Dharma‑gates, one should clarify the not‑moving gate, the non‑receiving gate, and the non‑practice gate; this is briefly not recorded. This chapter is the fourth intent of the trace‑gate circulation. If twenty‑thousand and eighty‑billion nayutas receive the command to propagate the sutra, deeply knowing provisional and real, widely knowing gradual and sudden, and also reaching capacities and conditions with自在神力, then the turbulent evils of the defiled world do not obstruct their propagation and there is no need to further show methods. But if beginners at the initial mind wish to cultivate the perfect practice and enter the defiled world to propagate, the defilement disturbs them; their self‑practice does not stand and they have no transforming功. For such persons, methods must be shown to clarify peaceful practices, therefore this chapter comes. What is the sequence of these peaceful practices? The Lotus’ perfect practice is one practice of immeasurable practices, inconceivable — how could there be fixed before and after? Now for the moment, with one thread: the “Dharma Teacher” chapter briefly shows propagation and takes benefiting others as the root, [1] first clarifying entering the room. In this chapter, discriminating evil‑world propagation and安 of逼惱, it first puts on the Tathāgata’s robe — thus the front and back mutually appear. If one speaks by the sequence of practice: all dharmas from the [2] beginning are always quiescent; if one departs quiescence and raises marks, one should first use prajñā to sweep away entanglements, thus first sit on the seat. All dharmas do not arise, yet prajñā arises; with同體 compassion for [3] beings one practices the path, next entering the Tathāgata’s room. Since compassion transforming the world must encounter compliance and opposition, one must settle in patience, next putting on the Tathāgata’s robe. Although made into this sequence, it is said not to be when practice is practiced: when practicing one enters [4] emptiness and immediately possesses all dharmas, how much more compassion and patience?

+
+Regarding the four peaceful practices, the former tradition says: (1) the two emptinesses of provisional and real are the substance, (2) preaching Dharma is the substance, (3) departing faults is the substance, (4) compassion is the substance. Master Ji says: (1) emptiness, (2) departing arrogance, (3) removing jealousy, (4) great compassion. Master Long says: (1) the body keeps far from all evil and gradually approaches the principle of emptiness, (2) remove mouth‑faults, (3) remove mind‑jealousy, (4) give rise to compassion. Master Nanyue says: (1) non‑attachment right wisdom, (2) the mouth does not speak faults, (3) revering above and接 below, (4) great compassion. Master Tiantai says: cessation‑contemplation‑compassion guide the three karmas and vows. For body‑karma, because there is cessation one departs coarse bodily karma; because there is contemplation one does not obtain the body; not obtaining bodily karma is not being able to depart it; because there is no attainment one does not fall into the ordinary‑person ground. Because there is compassion one diligently cultivates bodily karma and widely benefits all, not falling into the two‑vehicle ground. Because there is cessation‑practice one wears the patience‑robe; because there is contemplation‑practice one sits on the Tathāgata’s seat; because there is compassion one enters the Tathāgata’s room. The cessation‑practice departing faults becomes the virtue of cutting off; the contemplation‑practice non‑attachment becomes the virtue of wisdom; compassion benefitting others becomes the virtue of grace. The virtue of grace supports and completes the virtue of wisdom; the virtue of wisdom can通 the virtue of cutting off. This is called the peaceful practice of body‑karma. The remaining mouth, mind, and vows are also thus.

+
+The chapter’s text has question and answer. In the question, it first praises that the deep‑practice bodhisattvas of the prior chapter can thus propagate the sutra, then asks how the shallow‑practice bodhisattvas should preach this sutra in an evil age. Below “The Buddha said,” second: the answer has three: (1) marking the chapter of four practices, (2) explaining the methods of cultivation, (3) generally clarifying the marks of practice completed. The first marking is as in the text. Below “First, abide,” second: explaining the method, which is four divisions. The first section again has two: (1) explaining the method, (2) concluding practice‑completion. Cultivation has prose and verse. The prose again has two: [5] first, below “First,” marks the practice‑place; next, below “Mañjuśrī,” explains the practice‑place. First, double‑marking, as in the text. Next, in the explanation there are two: the “practice‑place” and the “near‑place.” Some say the inner ordinary person’s initial practice is called the practice‑place; if one long practices and becomes熟, one gradually can approach the principle and is called the near‑place, taking the prior chapter’s “near fruit” practice as an example. Some say the practice‑place is about the cause, the near‑place about the fruit; the practice‑place clarifies wisdom, the near‑place clarifies the境. Master Yao says: “From the seventh abode upward, the mind’s essence is in the principle, which is the practice‑place; it has passed the segmented realm. Below that, non‑arising is not yet present; gradually approaching the principle is the near‑place. Both are in the segmented realm; these two are the beginning of practice, and together are one peaceful practice.” I say: the first view takes practice as shallow; but the *Great Sutra* says “the tenth‑ground bodhisattvas, because of practice, see not‑clearly,” thus practice is not shallow. The latter view takes near as shallow; but the *Vimalakīrti* says “near to the incomparable Buddha’s自在 wisdom,” thus the near becomes deep. If both practices are deep, they become the practice of the prior chapter’s bodhisattvas’ propagation and do not concern beginners’ methods; if both are shallow, they are the practices of the seven expedients — how do they concern the perfect practice? Therefore one cannot偏 insist on shallow/deep. Yet “practice” means advance, “near” means intimate habituation; intimacy produces advance, and advance produces intimacy — how could there be shallow/deep? Moreover, the practice‑near is the method above: the practice‑place is the Tathāgata’s robe, the near‑place is the Tathāgata’s seat. Since robe and seat are not shallow or deep, how could practice‑near have superiority or inferiority? Again, patience must inwardly hold ultimate principle and endure events; it is called “practice.” The empty seat must fully realize external conditions [6] and rest in the true境; it is called “near.” Thus event and principle mutually appear — how could there be shallow/deep? If so, why divide practice and near? Approaching principle with a brief explanation is called the practice‑place; attaching to events with a broad explanation is called the near‑place. The explanations have breadth or brevity; the principle has no shallow or deep.

+
+Now, explaining the practice‑place by three dharmas. First: directly relying on the one truth. The one truth is where all return, and is the foundation for all, and is everywhere non‑discriminating. “Where all return” is the ground of patience. The ground is the middle way; all dharmas return to it, thus it is called ground. When all practices rest, it is called patience. This is the practice of “not‑practicing.” “The foundation for all” is like all things arising when they obtain the earth, and all practices being completed when they obtain the principle. If one obtains this principle‑basis, then in the hard one can be柔, in逆 one can be順, in暴 one can治, in驚 one can安. Measureless功德 arise from the middle‑way ground; though the ground has nothing born, it gives rise to功德 — this is the practice of “not‑practicing yet practicing.” “Everywhere non‑discriminating” means not discriminating the difference of not‑practicing and practicing; thus it says “also not‑practice and not‑discriminate,” which is “neither practice nor non‑practice.” Without the three practices yet having three practices, it is called practice; sharing one real truth, it is called place. This practice‑place matches the sutra text above: resting all practices matches the Tathāgata’s robe; spontaneously giving rise to功德 matches the Tathāgata’s room; everywhere non‑discriminating matches the Tathāgata’s seat. This is called explaining the practice‑place by one dharma; it is the method of propagating the sutra.

+二、約二法，即生、法二忍，二忍即生、法二空。二空異二乘。何者？人、法二空約真俗假實，明二空二忍悉見中道，故不同二乘。若更開者即四忍，若作五忍指善字為信忍，若作六忍指和字為和從忍；若對地即開四十二忍，一地尚有四十一地功德，一忍寧無四十一忍法耶？今且約四忍消文，謂伏、順、無生、寂滅忍[7]也。此四忍與別教異，彼前二忍是生忍，位則淺；後二忍是法忍，位則深。今圓生法悉通，四忍亦通。何者？二空理即是中道，初住修四忍入中見二空理，乃至後心亦[8]窮二空理。《大經》云「發心畢竟二不別」。若約無淺深判四忍者，從初發心圓伏五住，至金剛頂皆名伏忍；初後悉不違實相，名順忍；初後悉不起二邊心，名無生忍；初後悉休息眾行，名寂滅忍。聞生死不怱卒畏苦，聞涅槃不怱卒證樂，聞佛常與無常、二乘作佛不作佛，聞生死涅槃異與不異，聞佛道長短難易非長非短非難非易等皆不驚怖，行此行者，從始至終以二空理忍諸法，即著如來衣；安住二空理，即坐如來座；愍諸眾生，即入如來室。二空四忍名為行，理即是處，是名約二法明行處為弘經方軌也。

+Second: by two dharmas — the patience toward beings and the patience toward dharmas. The two patiences are the two emptinesses of beings and dharmas. The two emptinesses differ from the two vehicles. Why? The emptiness of persons and dharmas is explained via true and conventional, provisional and real, showing that the two emptinesses and two patiences all see the middle way, thus they are not the same as the two vehicles. If further opened, it becomes four patiences; if made five patiences, the善 character is taken as faith‑patience; if made six patiences, the和 character is taken as compliance‑patience. If matched to the grounds it opens into forty‑two patiences; one ground still has forty‑one grounds’功德 — how could one patience lack forty‑one patiences’ dharmas? Now, for the moment, use the four patiences to interpret the text: the patience of伏, 順, non‑arising, and quiescent‑extinction [7]. These four patiences differ from the Distinct teaching: there the first two are patience toward beings, with shallow position; the latter two are patience toward dharmas, with deep position. Now in the Perfect teaching, patience toward beings and dharmas both通; the four patiences also通. Why? The principle of the two emptinesses is exactly the middle way. At first abode one cultivates the four patiences and enters the middle, seeing the two‑emptiness principle; up to the later mind one also [8] exhausts the two‑emptiness principle. The *Great Sutra* says, “From the first arousing of mind to the end, the two are not separate.” If one judges the four patiences without shallow or deep, then from the first arousing of mind one perfectly subdues the five abodes, up to the diamond summit — all are called the patience of伏; from first to last none violates real‑mark, named the patience of順; from first to last none gives rise to two‑side mind, named the patience of non‑arising; from first to last all rest the myriad practices, named the patience of quiescent‑extinction. Hearing of birth‑and‑death, one does not abruptly fear suffering; hearing of nirvāṇa, one does not abruptly certify joy; hearing that the Buddha is constant or impermanent, that the two vehicles become or do not become Buddhas; hearing that birth‑and‑death and nirvāṇa are different or not different; hearing that the Buddha‑path is long or short, hard or easy, neither long nor short, neither hard nor easy — all these do not startle or fear. Those who practice thus, from beginning to end, use the two‑emptiness principle to endure all dharmas — this is wearing the Tathāgata’s robe; abiding in the two‑emptiness principle is sitting on the Tathāgata’s seat; pitying beings is entering the Tathāgata’s room. The two‑emptiness four‑patience is called practice; the principle is the place — this is called explaining the practice‑place by two dharmas and is the method of propagating the sutra.

+三、約三法，三法即不思議三諦也。「住忍辱地」總論三諦，如有地可據，方能忍辱也；「柔和善順」者，善順真諦，能忍虛妄見愛寒熱等，故言善順也。「而不卒暴[1]心不驚」者，安於俗諦，忍眾根緣稱適機宜，故云不卒暴，體忍違從故心不驚也。「於法無所行」等者，即安中諦，能忍二邊，故云無所行。正住中道故云「觀實相」，亦不得中實，故云「不分別」。此則據三諦之地名處，忍五住之辱名行。行亦為三，謂止行即行不行，觀行即非行非不行，慈悲行即不行行，合上衣座舍等，是為約三法明行處，辯弘經方軌也。
+
+Third: by three dharmas — the three inconceivable truths. “Dwelling on the ground of patience” generally discusses the three truths; only with ground to rely on can one endure. “Gentle and compliant” means well complying with the true truth, able to endure false views, craving, cold and heat, etc.; thus it says gentle and compliant. “And not sudden‑violent, [1] the mind not startled” means being at ease in the conventional truth, enduring beings’ roots and conditions as suitable to the capacities; thus it says not sudden‑violent, and because one embodies patience toward compliance and opposition the mind is not startled. “With respect to dharmas, there is nothing to practice” and the like means resting in the middle truth, able to endure the two extremes; thus it says nothing to practice. Precisely abiding in the middle way, thus it says “contemplate real‑mark”; also not grasping the middle’s realness, thus it says “not discriminating.” This takes the ground of the three truths as “place,” and patience toward the five abodes as “practice.” Practice is also three: cessation‑practice is “not‑practicing yet practicing”; contemplation‑practice is “neither practice nor non‑practice”; compassion‑practice is “not‑practicing yet practicing.” These correspond to the robe, seat, and room above; thus this explains the practice‑place by three dharmas and discriminates the method of propagating the sutra.

+龍師云：「住忍辱地總舉生、法二忍，下別明二忍，『柔和善順』明身業也，『而不卒暴』是口業，『心亦不驚』是意業。此就三業明修生忍。『於諸法無所行』，不行有相也；『而觀如實相』，行空平等也；『亦不行不分別』，不行無相也，有無兩亡會於中道，此三句明修法忍。得是二忍，結為行處。」彼明二忍，未知約何？若三教二忍，全非《法華》之義；若約圓教，不應隔別不融(云云)。
+
+Master Long says: “Dwelling on the ground of patience generally presents the two patiences of beings and dharmas; below it separately clarifies the two patiences. ‘Gentle and compliant’ clarifies body‑karma; ‘and not sudden‑violent’ is mouth‑karma; ‘mind also not startled’ is mind‑karma. This uses the three karmas to clarify cultivating patience toward beings. ‘With respect to dharmas there is nothing to practice’ is not‑practicing of marks; ‘and contemplate the real‑mark’ is practicing emptiness‑equality; ‘also no‑practice, no‑discrimination’ is not‑practicing of no‑marks. With existence and non‑existence both gone and meeting in the middle way, these three sentences clarify cultivating patience toward dharmas. Attaining these two patiences, they are concluded as the practice‑place.” He explains two patiences, but does not know by what they are taken; if by the two patiences of the three teachings, it is entirely not the *Lotus* meaning; if by the Perfect teaching, it should not be separated and not merged (etc.).

+「云何名近」下，第二，近處。文為三：遠十惱亂，即遠故論近，亦是附戒門助觀：修攝其心，即近故論近，亦是附定門助觀也；觀一切法空，即非遠非近論近，亦是附慧門助觀。上直緣理住忍辱地，今戒門廣出眾辱之緣應修遠離，非持刀仗亦不棄捨，但以正慧而遠離之，當知遠近廣上行所不行也。上直明不暴驚，今定門廣出修定心、修定處、修定要門，以定力故，在暴而治、在驚而安，當知即近論近，廣上不行行也。上直明無所行，今廣觀一切空具歷諸境，無量無邊無礙無障，當知非遠非近，廣上非行非不行。就初有十種應遠者：一、豪勢，二、[2]邪人法，三、兇險戲，四、[3]旃陀羅，五、二乘眾，六、遠欲想，七、遠不男，八、遠危害，九、遠譏嫌，十、遠畜養等。「路伽耶」，此云惡論，亦云破論。「逆路」者，逆君父之論。又「路」名為善論，亦名師破弟子；「逆路」名惡論，亦名弟子破師。「那羅延」者，上伎戲，亦云綵畫，其身作變異，又云緣幢擲倒之屬也。分十種為二邊：九是生死，一是涅槃，二俱遠離，即寂滅之異名耳。觀心釋十種云云，近近處有三意(云云)。[4]

+Below “How is it called near,” second: the near‑place. The text has three: keeping far from ten disturbances — speaking of near by way of far, also attaching to the precepts gate to aid contemplation; cultivating and gathering the mind — speaking of near by way of near, also attaching to the samādhi gate to aid contemplation; contemplating all dharmas as empty — speaking of near as neither far nor near, also attaching to the wisdom gate to aid contemplation. Above, one directly relies on principle and dwells on the ground of patience; now, through the precepts gate, the many conditions of辱 are broadly stated as to be kept far from. It is not that one holds刀仗 and does not abandon them, but that one uses correct wisdom to stay far from them — know that the far and near broadly extend the above “practice of not‑practicing.” Above it directly clarified not being sudden‑violent or startled; now the samādhi gate broadly gives cultivating the samādhi mind, cultivating the samādhi place, and cultivating the essential gate of samādhi; by the power of samādhi one can be among violence and still govern, among startling and still be calm — know that speaking of near by way of near broadly extends the above “not‑practicing yet practicing.” Above it directly clarified nothing to practice; now it broadly contemplates all emptiness and traverses all境, measureless, boundless, unobstructed, without障 — know that speaking of near as neither far nor near broadly extends the above “neither practice nor non‑practice.” In the first there are ten things to keep far from: (1) powerful influence, (2) [2]邪 persons and dharmas, (3) dangerous plays, (4) [3] caṇḍālas, (5) assemblies of the two vehicles, (6) desire‑thoughts, (7) hermaphrodites, (8) harm and danger, (9) slander and suspicion, (10) keeping livestock, etc. “Lokāyata” is translated “evil doctrines,” also “destructive doctrines.” “Inverse road” means doctrines that oppose ruler and parents. Again, “road” can mean good doctrine, also “teacher refutes disciple”; “inverse road” means evil doctrine, also “disciple refutes teacher.” “Nārāyaṇa” means upper‑level tricks and戏, also “painted transformation,” also those who climb poles and throw themselves down, etc. Dividing the ten kinds into two extremes: nine are birth‑and‑death, one is nirvāṇa; both extremes are to be kept far, which is simply another name for quiescent‑extinction. The contemplation‑of‑mind explains the ten kinds, etc.; the near‑near place has three meanings (etc.). [4]
