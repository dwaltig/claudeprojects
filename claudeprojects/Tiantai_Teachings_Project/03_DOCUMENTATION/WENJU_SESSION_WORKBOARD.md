## Active Block Card (Fill Each Session)

Session date: 2026-02-07

Operator: Codex + William

Block ID: F10-B56

Source file: `Tiantai_Teachings_Project/Tiantai_Great_Works/T1718_Fahua_Wenju/T1718_010.txt`

Source lines: line 463 發益結文 chain + line 467 final fascicle seam heading + lines 469-470 apparatus ([6]/[7])

CBETA start anchor: 第四、從「說是」下，發益之文也

CBETA end anchor: 下【大】，〔－〕【甲】

Target translation file: `Tiantai_Teachings_Project/01_TRANSLATIONS/The_Words_and_Phrases/Scholarly/Full_Translation/Wenju_Fascicle_10_FULL_Scholarly.md`

## Workflow V2 Gate Tracker (Must Stay In Order)

### Gate 1 - Boundary Map First
- [x] Boundaries explicitly mapped with CBETA locators.
- [x] Contiguity checked and confirmed.
- [x] Structural map drafted before English output.

### Gate 2 - Source Lock

- [x] Defect state moved only by lifecycle rules. (No state transitions required for F08-B01 through F08-B50 + F09-B01 through F09-B39 + F10-B01 through F10-B56 scope.)

### Gate 4 - Re-Audit Against CBETA
- [x] One-to-one coverage verified.

### Gate 5 - Tone Pass (Only After PASS)
- [ ] Allowed only after source-locked PASS.
- [ ] Meaning preserved and traceable to base text.
- [ ] Any tone edit remains re-checkable.

## Handoff Block (End Of Session)

Next recommended block: None (T1718 fascicles complete through T1718_010.txt end)

Next exact source range: None. Terminal anchor reached at T1718_010.txt line 467 seam + lines 469-470 apparatus ([6]/[7]).

Carry-over risks: If starting non-Wenju work in this log, preserve F10-B56 as terminal source-lock boundary and do not renumber prior F10 block IDs.

Open defects remaining: 0 (for F01-B01 through F01-B67 + F02-B01 through F02-B125 + F03-B01 through F03-B57 + F04-B01 through F04-B50 + F05-B01 through F05-B39 + F06-B01 through F06-B45 + F07-B01 through F07-B41 + F08-B01 through F08-B50 + F09-B01 through F09-B39 + F10-B01 through F10-B56 scopes)

Pending re-audit items: None for F01-B01 through F01-B67 + F02-B01 through F02-B125 + F03-B01 through F03-B57 + F04-B01 through F04-B50 + F05-B01 through F05-B39 + F06-B01 through F06-B45 + F07-B01 through F07-B41 + F08-B01 through F08-B50 + F09-B01 through F09-B39 + F10-B01 through F10-B56

Notes for next operator: Wenju source-lock corpus reached terminal end at `T1718_010.txt`; next session should either run a cross-fascicle consistency sweep or begin approved tone pass only after preserving this PASS baseline.
