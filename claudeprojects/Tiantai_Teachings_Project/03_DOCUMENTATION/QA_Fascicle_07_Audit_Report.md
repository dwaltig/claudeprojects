## I. Executive Summary

This audit confirms that the remediated translations of **Fascicle 7 Part 1** (Medicinal Herbs, Prophecy) and **Fascicle 7 Part 2** (Magic City, 500 Disciples) now meet the **Clarified Butter** standard of the Tiantai Translation Protocol. All identified ellipses and summary omissions have been resolved, and the text faithfully preserves Master Zhiyi's exegetical structure.

One final omission in Part 1 (regarding the "Eight Kinds of Bestowal") was identified and corrected during this audit session.

## II. Audit Findings

### A. Fascicle 7 Part 1 (Upper Roll)
*Focus: Medicinal Herbs Chapter (5) & Bestowal of Prophecy Chapter (6)*

| Checkpoint | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Medicinal Herbs Parable** | **PASS** | Complex "Six Parables" matching (Cloud, Rain, Ground, Plants, etc.) is fully translated without abbreviation. |
| **Verse Analysis** | **PASS** | Clause-by-clause correspondence between Prose and Verse sections is preserved. |
| **Prophecy Definitions** | **PASS** | Tiantai definitions of *Vyākaraṇa* (Jì) vs. *Avyākata* (Non-record) are clear. |
| **"Eight Kinds of Bestowal"** | **FIXED** | *Found:* Summary note ("Detailed breakdown omitted").<br>*Action:* Replaced with full translation of the *Yingluo Sutra* citations (Lines 696-704). |
| **Four Siddhantas** | **PASS** | Application of Four Siddhantas to Prophecy (Worldly, Individual, Therapeutic, First Principle) is accurate. |

### B. Fascicle 7 Part 2 (Lower Roll)
*Focus: Magic City Parable Chapter (7) & 500 Disciples Chapter (8)*

| Checkpoint | Status | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Three Turnings** | **PASS** | The "Three Turnings of the Dharma Wheel" (Demonstration, Exhortation, Certification) section is fully expanded (Lines 112+). |
| **Magic City Parable** | **PASS** | Detailed breakdown of the "500 Yojanas" and "Magic City" metaphor is complete. |
| **Time/Assembly Pure** | **PASS** | Ellipses resolved; full argument regarding the purity of time and assembly is present. |

| **500 Disciples** | **PASS** | Narrative of the "Drunken Man" parable and the "Gem in the Robe" is preserved with exegetical commentary. |

## III. Protocol Adherence

### 1. Structural Integrity
The translation rigorously maintains the **Wen-Da (Question/Answer)** format and the **Number-List** structures characteristic of Zhiyi's style. No "syllabus-style" flattening was detecting in the final version.

### 2. Terminology
*   **Three Truths:** Consistently applied. "Real" (*Shí*) and "Provisional" (*Quán*) are treated as simultaneous integrated aspects, not sequential stages.
*   **Tiantai Specifics:** *Panjiao* terms (Five Flavors, Four Teachings) are rendered correctly. The distinction between "Ash-Body" (Hinayana Nirvana) and "Ultimate Nirvana" (Mahayana) is sharp.

### 3. Tone
The **Scholarly (Professor)** persona is maintained throughout. The footnotes provide necessary context without becoming intrusive. The "Road Manager" confirms that the polemical edge (Zhiyi's critique of "Old Interpretations" and "Guangzhai") is preserved and not softened.

## IV. Conclusion

Fascicle 7 is now considered **Audit Complete**. The text is ready for integration into the Master Compilation.

**Signed,**
The Road Manager
