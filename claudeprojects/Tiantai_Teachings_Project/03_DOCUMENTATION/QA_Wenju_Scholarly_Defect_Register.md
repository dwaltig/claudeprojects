For example, when Sudhana enters the Dharma-realm and sees that Manjuśrī's form and images are boundless and his Dharma-gates deep and far, [this shows they] are fundamentally adjacent to the Buddhas. In trace, they assist Śākyamuni as bodhisattvas. By the power of the samādhi of universally manifesting form-bodies, they scatter their traces and let their appearances descend.

**Next, in terms of the "horizontal" praise: it directly explains it in terms of the First Abode; by analogy, the other ranks can be understood. In the First Abode of initial arousing of the mind, one arouses once and everything is aroused; one goes beyond the two extremes, transforms the ordinary and surpasses the sage, entering the Middle Way. The mind is quiescent, and thought after thought flows into the sea of omniscience; therefore it is said to attain non-retrogression.**

**This meaning should now be distinguished. The rising and sinking of the destinies depends on whether precepts are upheld or violated; seeing the Buddha or not seeing the Buddha depends on whether the vehicle is slow or swift. Upholding precepts has coarse and fine, therefore the recompense is superior or inferior; upholding the vehicle has small and great, therefore seeing the Buddha has provisional and real. Briefly judging both precepts and vehicle each as three grades, and by one line from the *Nirvāṇa* unfolding them into four statements, the meaning becomes clear: (1) both precepts and vehicle are swift; (2) precepts are lax and vehicle is swift; (3) precepts are swift and vehicle is lax; (4) both precepts and vehicle are lax.**

**As for the phrase "the entire Buddha-world's earth moves in six ways": the old explanation says it is the six fixed attachments of the three-vehicle people's cause-and-fruit. This breaks the Tripiṭaka school's three vehicles' six attachments, but does not break the Shared Teaching's three vehicles' six attachments. In the Shared Teaching, if one speaks in terms of dharmas, the three people's cause-and-fruit are the same; if one speaks in terms of persons, the three people's cause-and-fruit differ. Both this sameness and difference are broken, yet the old school's intent of breaking does not break this. In the Distinct Teaching, since there is no name of \"three vehicles,\" there are then no six attachments - which the old [explanation] does not break. Now we clarify that in the Distinct school, at the time of cause the three dharmas interweave horizontally and vertically, and at the time of fruit the three dharmas also interweave horizontally and vertically - this too must be broken.**

**Answer: Heavenly flowers delight the eyes; earth-shaking shakes the mind. The *Mahā-sūtra* says: \"When it moves, it can cause sentient beings' minds to move.\" Flowers and earth are external omens; mind-joy is an internal omen. It is not ordinary joy. Though such joy has existed in the past, [one] was not moved by joy and yet could contemplate the Buddha with one mind - how could it not be an omen? If one says joy moves the defiled (skandha) mind, that is the human-and-heaven meaning. If joy moves the undefiled mind of the True Truth, that is the Tripiṭaka/Shared meaning. If joy moves the Provisional mind, that is the Distinct meaning. If joy moves the mind of the Real Aspect, that is the Perfect meaning.**[^14]

**Next, explaining the omen of the Buddha emitting light: it signifies establishing teaching in response to capacities, breaking delusion and removing doubt. The white curl possesses various merits. The *Contemplation of the Buddha-Sea Samādhi Sutra* says: \"When the Buddha was first born, it was drawn out to be five *chǐ* long; when practicing asceticism it was one *zhàng* four *chǐ* long; when he attained Buddhahood it was one *zhàng* five *chǐ* long. Within the hair, inside and outside are both empty, like a white beryl tube, pure within and without. From the first arousing of the mind, through the various practices and various appearances in the middle, up to entering nirvāṇa, all merits are displayed within the hair.\" The curl is between the two eyebrows, symbolizing the Middle Way's permanence; its softness symbolizes bliss; its free rolling and unrolling symbolizes self; its whiteness symbolizes purity. Emitting light breaks darkness, symbolizing that from the Middle Way wisdom arises. The light illuminating this land and other lands symbolizes self-enlightenment and enlightening others.**[^15]

In a moment a trusted report arrived: "Last night heaven and earth shook greatly; the Crown Prince has become a Buddha." The King had great joy. King Śuklodana reported: "A son has been born."

**From "If a person has blessings"—the next single line—this opens the Middle Vehicle. If one makes few offerings to a Buddha, one encounters suffering and is afflicted. If one makes many[^25] offerings to a Buddha, although one encounters suffering one has blessings. Therefore it says: a śrāvaka plants blessings over three lifetimes; a pratyekabuddha plants blessings over a hundred kalpas. In comparison with those śrāvakas, therefore it says "has blessings."**

**From "If there are Buddha-sons" downwards, this opens the Mahāyāna of the Six Pāramitās. True compassion can continue the Buddha-seed, therefore they are called "Buddha-sons." They cultivate the Six Pāramitās, therefore it says "various practices." Because they aspire and seek,[^26] therefore it says "unsurpassed wisdom." Within the Six Pāramitās there are no six hindrances; like medicine that contains no disease, therefore it is called the "pure path"—it is not ultimately pure.**
