## 19. THE BESTIARY OF THE BURNING HOUSE (Detailed Mapping)

The Master provides a precise mapping of the "Evil Beasts" mentioned in the Burning House verse. These represent the specific mental afflictions of the Three Realms.

### I. The Five Dull Drivers (Five Bhikṣus / Dull Afflictions)
1.  **Birds (Hawks, Owls, Eagles):** Represent the **Eight Prides** (*Bā mán*).
    *   *Owl:* Arrogance of strength.
    *   *Eagle:* Arrogance of wealth.
    *   *Vulture:* Arrogance of freedom.
    *   *Magpie/Pigeon:* Arrogance of cleverness and good looks.
2.  **Snakes and Scorpions:** Represent **Anger** (*Huì*).
    *   *Poisonous Snake:* Irrational anger (without cause).
    *   *Viper:* Rationalized anger (clinging to one's "rights").
    *   *Centipede:* Playful/Mocking anger (*Xièlùn*).
3.  **Insects and Beetles:** Represent **Ignorance** (*Chī*). They gather on "Excrement and Urine" (the pollutions of the body) thinking it is pure.
4.  **Foxes and Wolves:** Represent **Greed** (*Tān*). Powerful greed (wolves) and powerless/begging greed (foxes).
5.  **Fighting Dogs:** Represent **Doubt** (*Yí*). Indecision between the two extremes (Yes/No) leads to "snarling and barking."

### II. The Five Sharp Drivers (Ghosts/Yakṣas)
Zhiyi maps the "Ghostly" elements to the **Five Wrong Views**:
1.  **Yakṣas (Fleet-footed Ghosts):** Represent **Evil View** (*Xiéjiàn*)—denying cause and effect. "Eating human flesh" = Destroying the root of goodness.
2.  **Kumbhāṇḍas:** Represent **Attachment to Rituals** (*Jièqǔ*). Crouching on "Dirt Mounds" (the high points of the Desire Realm).
3.  **Large Naked Ghosts:** Represent **View of Self** (*Shēnjiàn*). They are "Naked" because they have no shame/virtue and "Black" because of evil karma.
4.  **Needle-Throated Hunger Ghosts:** Represent **Perverted Views** (*Jiànqǔ*). Their throats are narrow (no room for truth) but their bellies are large (infinite desire).

## 20. CHAPTER 4: BELIEF AND UNDERSTANDING (Xìnjiě Pǐn 信解品)

This chapter records the understanding of the four great Śrāvakas (Subhūti, Mahākāśyapa, Mahākātyāyana, Maudgalyāyana).

### I. The Meaning of "Belief and Understanding"
*   **Belief (*Xìn*):** Breaking doubt to enter the Path of Vision (*Jiàndào*).
*   **Understanding (*Jiě*):** Advancing into the Path of Cultivation (*Xiūdào*).
*   **Tiantai Note:** This is the **Middle Root** response. After hearing the Parable of the Burning House, these disciples finally "get it."

### II. The Parable of the Prodigal Son (Qióngzǐ Pì 窮子譬)
Zhiyi maps the "Hustle" of the Father (Buddha) to the "Recovery" of the Son (Sentient Beings).

1.  **The Departure:** The Son leaves the Father (Retreating from the Bodhisattva path into ignorance).
2.  **The Poverty:** The Son wanders for 50 years (The Five Paths of Rebirth). He is "Poor" because he lacks the Dharma-Wealth.
3.  **The Encounter:** The Son arrives at the Father's city. He sees the Father's wealth and is **terrified**.
    *   *Architect's Insight:* When a Small-Vehicle practitioner first hears the Great Vehicle, they are scared. They think, "This is too big for me; I just want to be a simple worker."
4.  **The Recruitment:** The Father hires the Son to "Clear Excrement" (*Chú fèn*).
    *   *Identity:* "Excrement" = The afflictions of the Three Realms. "Cleaning" = The Tripiṭaka (Small Vehicle) practice.
5.  **The Trust:** Over 20 years, the Son becomes the "Steward" of the house but still thinks of himself as an employee.
    *   *Identity:* This is the **Shared** and **Distinct** teachings where the disciple handles the Great Vehicle's assets (knowledge) but doesn't feel they *own* them.
6.  **The Inheritance:** Finally, the Father gathers the assembly and announces: "This is my son. All my wealth is his."
    *   *Identity:* This is the **Lotus Sutra**. The Buddha confirms: "You are not my employee; you are the Heir. Everything I have is yours."

### ARCHITECT'S TECHNICAL APPARATUS

1.  **The Meaning of "Elderly" (*Shòumài*):** When Subhūti says "We are old and worn out," he is not talking about physical age. He is describing the **Stagnation of the Arhat**. They have attained the "Cool Pond" and lost the fire to strive for Buddhahood. The Lotus Sutra "re-ignites" them.
2.  **Cleaning Excrement (*Chú fèn*):** This is Zhiyi's most famous technical mapping. The "Small Vehicle" (Hinayana) is essentially a **Janitorial Job**. It's useful for cleaning up the mess of the world, but it's not the purpose of the house.
3.  **The Steward vs. The Heir:** The difference between a "Bodhisattva of the earlier teachings" and a "Bodhisattva of the Lotus" is **Ownership**. The Steward manages the Dharma for others; the Heir realizes the Dharma *is* his own nature.
