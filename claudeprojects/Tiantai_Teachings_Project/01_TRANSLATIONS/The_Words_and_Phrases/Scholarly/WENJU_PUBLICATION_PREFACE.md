## 1. Project Scope & Methodology

This publication represents a **Scholarly Study Edition** of Grand Master Zhiyi's *Fáhuá Wénjù* (Words and Phrases of the Lotus Sutra). 

The *Wenju* is a massive, ten-fascicle commentary that functions as a line-by-line exegesis of the *Lotus Sutra*. In the original Chinese (CBETA T.1718), it spans over 150,000 characters of dense, dialectical Classical Chinese.

**This edition does not aim for exhaustive, sentence-by-sentence reproduction.** Instead, it adopts a "Core Architecture" approach, translating approximately **17% of the total source text**.

### Selection Criteria
The translated sections were selected based on the following priorities:
1.  **Doctrinal Architecture:** The complete translation of Zhiyi's "Four Methods of Interpretation" (*Sì Yì Xiāowén*), the "Ten Suchnesses," and the "Three Truths."
2.  **Parable Exegesis:** The full structural mapping of the Seven Parables (Burning House, Prodigal Son, Medicinal Herbs, Phantom City, Gem in the Robe, King's Jewel, Physician).
3.  **Polemical Criticality:** The retention of key Q&A (*Wèn-Dá*) sections where Zhiyi distinguishes the Perfect Teaching from the Tripiṭaka, Shared, and Distinct teachings.
4.  **Practice Relevance:** Sections that provide direct instruction on "Observation of the Mind" (*Guānxīn*).

## 2. Note on "Liberation Technology"

While this is a "Scholarly" edition—adhering to rigorous terminology and historical context—it is designed as **Liberation Technology**.

*   **Philological Rigor:** We have retained the precise Tiantai vocabulary (e.g., *Quán/Shí* for Provisional/Real, *Jī/Yìng* for Capacity/Response) rather than smoothing them into generic English.
*   **Dialectical Edge:** We have preserved the "Q&A" format which acts as the engine of Zhiyi's thought. This is not a passive lecture; it is an active interrogation of the nature of reality.
*   **The "Architect" Persona:** The translation voice is that of "The Architect"—systematic, precise, and structural. It avoids the colloquialisms of the "Practitioner" track to provide a stable, authoritative reference.

## 3. How to Use This Text

This edition is designed to be read alongside the *Lotus Sutra* itself (Kumārajīva's translation). 
1.  Read the Sutra chapter.
2.  Consult the corresponding *Wenju* fascicle to understand the **"Why"** and **"How"** behind the Sutra's narrative.
3.  Use the **Observation of the Mind** sections to internalize the external teaching.

## 4. Source Reference

All translations are based on the **CBETA edition of T.1718** (Taishō Shinshū Daizōkyō, Vol. 34). 
*   **Total Source Lines:** ~4,032
*   **Translated Lines:** ~669 (Scholarly Core)
*   **Coverage Ratio:** ~17%

This ratio ensures that the student receives the *essential structure* of the Master's thought without being overwhelmed by the exhaustive scholastic detail of the 6th century.
