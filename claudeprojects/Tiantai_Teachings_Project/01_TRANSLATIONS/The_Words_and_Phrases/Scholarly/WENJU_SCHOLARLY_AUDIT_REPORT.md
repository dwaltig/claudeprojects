## Pattern Analysis

### Strengths Across Corpus

1. **Doctrinal Fidelity**: All core Tiantai terms accurately rendered
   - 三諦 (Three Truths) → Empty, Provisional, Middle
   - 權實 (Provisional/Real) → Expedient/Ultimate
   - 本迹 (Fundamental/Trace) → properly distinguished
   - 四教 (Four Teachings) → Tripiṭaka, Shared, Distinct, Perfect

2. **Q&A Preservation**: 問/答 structure consistently maintained as scholarly dialogue

3. **Technical Apparatus**: Zhiyi's "Architect's Technical Apparatus" sections add valuable meta-commentary

4. **Polemical Edge**: Most of Zhiyi's anti-Huayan/anti-Chan arguments preserved

5. **Structural Integrity**: 10-Fascicle architecture maintained, chapter flow logical

### Weaknesses Across Corpus

1. **Coverage Compression**: 17% average ratio means this is a study edition, not exhaustive translation

2. **Occasional Softening**: A few polemical edges diplomatized (Fascicles 4, 7)

3. **Terminology Consistency**: Minor variations need glossary standardization

## Required Corrections

### HIGH PRIORITY

1. **Glossary Standardization**
   - Create appendix with canonical term mappings
   - Ensure 100% consistency on key terms across all 10 fascicles
   - Add Chinese characters for all technical terms

2. **Source Citation**
   - Add CBETA line references to footnotes
   - Format: `T1718_001.txt, lines 45-52`
   - Allows readers to cross-reference Chinese source

3. **Coverage Transparency**
   - Add preface note:
   > "This translation renders approximately 17% of Zhiyi's original text, prioritizing core doctrinal arguments, Q&A dialogues, and parable exegesis. It functions as a scholarly study edition, not an exhaustive translation."

### MEDIUM PRIORITY

4. **Fascicle 4 & 7 Review**
   - Re-audit for polemical edge
   - Check if any Q&A compressed too aggressively
   - Restore dialectical nuance where space permits

5. **Cross-References**
   - Add internal references between fascicles
   - E.g., "See Fascicle 3 for Sun Moon Lamp Bright Buddha discussion"

### LOW PRIORITY

6. **Practitioner Notes**
   - Consider adding "Application" sidebars for key passages
   - Balances scholarly rigor with accessibility
   - Optional, not mandatory

## Seven-Factor Integrity Assessment

| Factor | Grade | Finding |
|--------|-------|---------|
| **Right View** | A | Doctrinal accuracy maintained; Three Truths preserved |
| **Right Intent** | A | Translation serves liberation, not academic vanity |
| **Right Speech** | A- | Sacca (Truth) gate passed; minor Kāla (Timeliness) issues |
| **Right Action** | A | No harm; precision over force |
| **Right Effort** | B+ | Good prevention of errors; some cultivation needed |
| **Right Livelihood** | A | No harm laundering; ethical translation practice |
| **Right Mindfulness** | A | Clear purpose; appropriate method |

---

## The Single Integrative Question

> "Does this translation decrease clinging—in the reader—right now?"

**Answer: YES**

By preserving Zhiyi's systematic deconstruction of attachment to expedient teachings (權) and his clear pointing to ultimate reality (實), this translation functions as liberation technology. The Q&A format forces readers to confront conceptual rigidity. The Burning House parable's existential urgency is intact. The Life-Span chapter's "eternal Buddha" teaching correctly undermines nihilistic views.

---

## Conclusion

The Wenju Scholarly Edition demonstrates exceptional fidelity to Zhiyi's T.1718 source. The translator ("The Architect") has successfully navigated the technical density of the original without academic ossification or populist dilution.

**Final Verdict: PASS with commendation.**

Proceed to publication with HIGH PRIORITY corrections (Glossary, Source Citations, Coverage Note).
