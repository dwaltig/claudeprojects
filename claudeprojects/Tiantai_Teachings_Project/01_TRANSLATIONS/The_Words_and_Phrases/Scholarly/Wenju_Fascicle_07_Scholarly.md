## 19. CHAPTER 5: THE PARABLE OF THE MEDICINAL HERBS (Yàocǎo Yù Pǐn)

### I. Exegesis of the Title
The Master (Zhiyi) explains the nomenclature: "In this parable, there are mountains, rivers, clouds, and rain, yet it is titled solely after the 'Medicinal Herbs.' The earth is the producer; the clouds and rain are the moisteners. The grasses and trees are that which is produced and moistened. While all have utility, the utility of medicinal herbs is most potent. They represent the capacity of 'Non-leakage' (*wúlòu*) to eradicate the 'Four Winds and Cold' of the afflictions."

### II. Mapping the Ecosystem of Capacity
The Master distinguishes the growth according to the **Seven Expedients** (*qī fāngbiàn*):

1.  **Small Herbs (*Xiǎo yào*)**: Represent the Human and Deva vehicles. They possess the "roots" of the five precepts and ten virtues, seeking to escape the heat of the lower realms but lacking the capacity for self-transcendence.
2.  **Medium Herbs (*Zhōng yào*)**: Represent the Śrāvaka and Pratyekabuddha. They have realized the Four Noble Truths and Twelve Links of Dependent Origination. They possess the "juice" of Nirvana but lack the "shade" of extensive compassion.
3.  **Superior Herbs and Trees**:
    *   **Small Trees**: Bodhisattvas of the **Shared Teaching** (*tòng jiào*). They have broken the view and thought afflictions and began the work of universal benefit.
    *   **Large Trees**: Bodhisattvas of the **Distinct Teaching** (*bié jiào*). They are established in the "Infrastructure" of the Ten Stages (*bhūmi*), capable of sustaining the dharma-rain and providing refuge for all sentient beings.

### III. The Non-Dual Ground (Wú Chábié)
The Master argues for the unity of the source: "Though produced from one ground and moistened by one rain, the differences arise from the species. The ground represents the **True Mark** (*shíxiàng*); the rain represents the **One Vehicle** (*yīshèng*). The Buddha's wisdom is like the great cloud—universal and impartial."

## 20. CHAPTER 7: THE PARABLE OF THE PHANTOM CITY (Huàchéng Yù Pǐn)

### I. Scholastic Debates on the 500 Yojanas
The Master records and adjudicates various interpretations of the distance:
*   **Master Ji (Kuiji's) View**: 300 yojanas represent the afflictions of the Three Realms; 400 represent the habit-residues of the seven stages; 500 represent the fundamental ignorance beyond the eighth stage.
*   **The Master's Synthesis**: The distance represents the progression of "View", "Thought", "Dust and Sand", and "Ignorance" (*wúmíng*).
    *   **300 Yojanas**: The escape from the Three Realms (The Two-Vehicle attainment).
    *   **400 Yojanas**: The entry into the Realization of the Middle Path (The Distinct Teaching).
    *   **500 Yojanas**: The attainment of the **Treasure Place** (*zhēnbǎo chù*), the Sea of All-Knowledge.

### II. Dialectical Q&A (Wèn-Dá)

**Question:** Both the "Three Cars" (Burning House) and the "Phantom City" represent the attainment of Non-arising Wisdom (*wúshēng zhì*). Why are the cars described as non-existent (skillful means) while the city is described as existent? Why are there three cars but only one city?

**Answer:**
1.  **Existence vs. Non-existence**: In the Burning House, the Elder promises cars outside the gate to lure the children out. This is a verbal expedient (*shèlì*)—the cars do not physically exist at that moment. In the Phantom City, the Guide manifests a city in the wilderness through supernatural power. Because it is a manifestation to provide rest, it is described as "existent" within the context of the travelers' experience, though it is "phantom" in its ultimate nature.
2.  **Unity vs. Multiplicity (Polemical Edge):**
    *   **The City is One:** All travelers (Three Vehicles) require the same rest at the same stage of exhaustion (the 300 Yojana mark). This refutes the view that the Three Vehicles have different Nirvanas. There is only one cessation of the sectioned birth-and-death (*fēnduàn shēngsǐ*).
    *   **The Cars are Three:** They represent the specific inclinations (*yù*) and methods of the three types of practitioners.
3.  **Motion vs. Stillness:** The Cars represent the "Vehicle" (*shèng*) that carries one forward (Dynamic). The City represents the "Nirvana" (*nièpán*) that provides cessation and rest (Static).

## 21. CHAPTER 8: THE PREDICTION OF THE FIVE HUNDRED DISCIPLES

### I. The Parable of the Hidden Pearl
The Master explains the mapping of the "Drunkard" and the "Pearl":
*   **The Inebriation**: Represents the fundamental ignorance that obscures the Buddha-nature.
*   **The Sewing of the Pearl**: Represents the **Original Connection** (*jiéyuán*) made under previous Buddhas (specifically the 16th Prince).
*   **The Wandering Poverty**: Represents the practitioners of the Small Vehicle who are satisfied with "minimal gain" (the rest-stop of Arhatship) while possessing the potential for supreme wealth.
*   **The Reveal**: The realization that the "Wealth of the Buddha" has been present within the "Garment of the Mind" throughout the cycle of birth and death.
