## 15. CHAPTER 12: DEVADATTA (Tipópótí Pǐn 提婆達多品)

The Master explains the function of "Devadatta" as the **Teacher of the Buddha** in the distant past, representing the non-duality of good and evil.

### I. The Attainment of the Great Slanderer
*   **The Exegesis:** Why does the Buddha predict Buddhahood for Devadatta, who committed the three deadly sins? 
*   **The Principle:** This demonstrates the **Subtle Dharma of the One Vehicle** where even the "Icchantika" (the incorrigible) possess the Buddha-nature. Devadatta is the "Good Knowledge Advisor" (*shànzhīshí*) in reverse, providing the adversarial conditions necessary for the Buddha's perfection of patience.

### II. The Dragon Girl’s Enlightenment (Lóngnǚ Chéngfó)
*   **The Three Doubts:** The assembly doubts because (1) she is female, (2) she is an animal, and (3) she is young.
*   **The Resolution:** By offering her pearl (the essence of her life/causal merit) and immediately attaining enlightenment in the Southern World, she proves that the **Perfect Teaching** does not depend on time, gender, or species. It is "Direct Seating at the Path-site."

## 16. CHAPTER 13: ENCOURAGEMENT TO UPHOLD (Quànchí Pǐn 勸持品)

The Master distinguishes between the "Vow of the Bodhisattvas" and the "Vow of the Śrāvakas."

### I. The Armor of Patience (*Rěnrǔ Kǎi* 忍辱鎧)
*   **Definition:** Upholding the sutra in an evil age requires "Armor." 
*   **The Three Types of Armor:**
    1.  *Tripiṭaka:* Observing impermanence and no-self.
    2.  *Distinct:* Observing the progression of the Ten Stages.
    3.  *Perfect:* "念佛為鎧" (Mindfulness of the Buddha as Armor)—realizing that the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Mind are a single, indestructible Reality.

## 17. CHAPTER 14: PEACEFUL PRACTICES (Ānlèxíng Pǐn 安樂行品)

This chapter provides the "Methodology for Beginners" (*chūxīn*) to uphold the sutra without burnout or spiritual danger.

### I. The Meaning of "Peaceful Practice"
*   **Peace (*Ān*):** Unmoved by the six paths of birth and death (Body).
*   **Joy (*Lè*):** Free from the "Five Receptions" (*pañca-vedanā*) of the worldly and the partial (Mind).
*   **Practice (*Xíng*):** The non-action of the Middle Way.

### II. The Four Peaceful Practices (*Sì ānlè xíng*)
1.  **Peaceful Practice of the Body:** Avoiding the "Ten Attachments" (power, wrong views, dangerous games, etc.).
2.  **Peaceful Practice of the Mouth:** Refraining from speaking of the faults of others or the deficiencies of earlier teachings.
3.  **Peaceful Practice of the Mind:** Freeing the mind from jealousy, flattery, and deceit.
4.  **Peaceful Practice of Vows:** Cultivating the "Great Compassionate Vow" to lead all beings to the Lotus realization.

### ARCHITECT'S TECHNICAL APPARATUS

1.  **The Mapping of the Dragon Girl's Pearl:** The pearl is not a physical object but the **Round Result** (*yuán guǒ*) of her practice. Offering it to the Buddha represents the "Conversion of Cause into Result."
2.  **Devadatta as "Teacher":** Zhiyi uses this to establish the **First Principle Siddhānta**—in the ultimate reality, there is no distinction between "Saint" and "Sinner." Both are functions of the One Reality.
3.  **The Armor of the Perfect Teaching:** Unlike the "Defensive" armor of the Small Vehicle (avoiding the world), the Perfect Armor is "Pervasive." One realizes that the environment *is* the Buddha-nature, thus there is nothing to be "defended" against.
