## 1. PREFACE BY SHENJIONG (鏡中沙門神逈述)

The ultimate Principle (*zhìlǐ* 至理) is without name, yet its name flows beneath the four heavens. The True Vehicle (*zhēncéng* 真乘) is unmoving, yet its movement emerges from the midst of the Triple Realm. To realize the teaching is to find stillness within the affair (*shì* 事); the Siddhāntas follow conditions to transform sentient beings.

Regarding the *Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sūtra*: Ever since the Buddha appeared in the world, it was spoken for the sake of the **One Great Matter of Causes and Conditions** (*yī dàshì yīnyuán* 一大事因緣). Medicinal plants differ, and the moisture they receive varies; capacities (*jī* 機) are not singular, and the teachings received vary accordingly. When the Buddha applied the **Provisional** (*quán* 權), he turned the Dharma-wheel of the Four Truths. When he revealed the **Real** (*shí* 實), he manifested the Pure Land on Eagle Peak.

The Tiantai Grand Master, Zhiyi, formerly heard this scripture directly before the Tathāgata at the assembly on Gṛdhrakūṭa; his rank resides in the **Five Stages of Identity** (*wǔ pǐn* 五品). This *Wenju* (Words and Phrases) is the record of the Dharma Master Guanding, totaling twenty volumes.

## 2. VOLUME 1: COMMENTARY ON THE INTRODUCTION (序品第一)

### I. Defining "Introduction" (序 *Xù*)
"Introduction" implies "orderly sequence" (*xiángxù* 庠序). The scriptural masters define it as **Sequence** (*cì* 次), **Reason** (*yóu* 由), and **Narration** (*shù* 述).
1.  **Sequence:** The five matters that crown the head of the sūtra.
2.  **Reason:** The six auspicious omens that serve as the starting point.
3.  **Narration:** The questions and answers that resolve doubt.

### II. The Four Methods of Interpretation (四意消文)
Every phrase of the sūtra is filtered through these four lenses:
1.  **Causes and Conditions (*Yīnyuán* 因緣):** Also called **Resonance** (*gǎnyìng* 感應). The intersection of the seeker's readiness and the Buddha's response.
2.  **According to the Teaching (*Yuējiào* 約教):** Differentiation by the Four Teachings (Tripiṭaka, Shared, Distinct, Perfect).
3.  **Fundamental and Trace (*Běnjì* 本迹):** Distinguishing the historical manifestation (Trace) from the original enlightenment (Fundamental).
4.  **Observation of the Mind (*Guānxīn* 觀心):** Internalizing the external words as a meditative realization within one's own mind.

## 3. THE COMMON PROLOGUE (通序 Tōng Xù)

### I. "Thus have I heard" (Rúshì wǒwén 如是我聞)
*   **According to the Teaching:** 
    *   *Tripiṭaka:* Ananda transmits the conventional words which correspond to the Buddha's speech.
    *   *Shared:* Realizes Form is Emptiness.
    *   *Distinct:* Realizes the progression from limited to limitless.
    *   *Perfect:* Realizes Samsara *is* Nirvana; the "Thus-Thus Unmoving" is "Right."
*   **Fundamental and Trace:** "I heard" applies to the Trace (the historical gathering). The communication of Truth since the distant past applies to the Fundamental.

### II. "At One Time" (Yīshí 一時)
*   **First Principle:** The moment when the Path and the Time unite. In the Lotus Sutra, this is the "Upper-Upper One-Time," the highest possible union of reality and wisdom.

### III. "The Buddha" (Fó 佛)
*   **The Four Buddhas:**
    1.  *Tripiṭaka:* The 16-foot old Bhikṣu body.
    2.  *Shared:* The "Superior Body" (*Zūn-tè shēn*).
    3.  *Distinct:* Sitting on the Lotus Throne of the Ten Stages.
    4.  *Perfect:* Pervading the Dharma-realm like space.

## 4. THE ASSEMBLY (海眾集結)

### I. The Arhats (Great Disciples)
Zhiyi provides a detailed exegesis of the primary disciples, mapping each according to the Four Methods:

1.  **Śāriputra (舍利弗):**
    *   *Etymology:* "Son of Śārī" (the Myna bird).
    *   *Trace:* The "Foremost in Wisdom."
    *   *Fundamental:* He has attained the Mother of Wisdom (Real Mark) in the distant past; his manifestation as a Śrāvaka is a skillful means to lead those of the Small Vehicle.
    *   *Mind:* Wisdom is the Subject; Truth is the Object. Their union is the internal Śāriputra.

2.  **Mahākāśyapa (摩訶迦葉):**
    *   *Etymology:* "Great Turtle" or "Light-Drinker."
    *   *Trace:* Foremost in Dhūta (ascetic) practices.
    *   *Fundamental:* He has long practiced the "Dharma of the Middle Way," yet manifests as an ascetic to rebuke the greed and attachment of the age.

3.  **Mahākātyāyana (摩訶迦旃延):**
    *   *Etymology:* "Ornamental Eloquence."
    *   *Trace:* Foremost in debating and expanding on the Dharma.
    *   *Mapping (According to Teaching):*
        *   *Tripiṭaka:* Using "Impermanence/No-self" to refute nihilism.
        *   *Perfect:* Using "Non-dual Reality" to refute all views.

4.  **Mahāmaudgalyāyana (大目揵連):**
    *   *Etymology:* "Bean Root" (Maudgala Clan).
    *   *Trace:* Foremost in Supernatural Powers (*ṛddhi*).
    *   *Fundamental:* Established in the **Śūraṅgama Samādhi**, he manifests powers to subdue the arrogant (e.g., the dragons Nanda and Upananda).
    *   *Mind:* The spontaneous function of the Three Truths within a single thought-moment is the true supernatural power.

5.  **Aniruddha (阿㝹樓馱):**
    *   *Etymology:* "Unimpeded" or "Never Poor."
    *   *Trace:* Foremost in the Celestial Eye (*tiānyǎn*).
    *   *Narrative:* Having lost his physical eyes through over-exertion in meditation (never sleeping for seven days), the Buddha taught him the "Vajra-Illuminating Samādhi," granting him the Celestial Eye that sees the Great Thousand World as a fruit in the palm of his hand.

### ARCHITECT'S TECHNICAL APPARATUS

1.  **The Mappings of the Disciples:** Notice that for every disciple, Zhiyi performs a "Recovery" of their status. They are not merely "Small Vehicle Arhats" but Bodhisattvas of the distant past (Fundamental) playing roles (Trace).
2.  **Supernatural Powers (*ṛddhi*):** Zhiyi redefines Maudgalyāyana’s powers. They are not merely magic tricks but the external manifestation of the **Perfect Teaching's** realization of the interpenetration of all phenomena.
3.  **Celestial Eye (*tiānyǎn*):** In Aniruddha's case, the loss of physical sight is the "Cause" for the opening of the "Spiritual Sight." This mirrors the Lotus Sutra's move: discarding the "Provisional Eye" (Small Vehicle) to attain the "Real Eye" (Buddha Wisdom).
