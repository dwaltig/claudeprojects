From [the line] "At that time the World-Honored One told Śāriputra, 'You have already earnestly requested three times, how could I not speak?'" onwards, the text extensively clarifies the **Opening of the Three** (*kāi sān*) and **Revealing of the One** (*xiǎn yī*).

### Meanings 1: General and Distinct (Lines 22-23; CBETA 004:22–23)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
一、明通別者，初周別名法說，通則具三；
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**1. Clarifying the General and Distinct:**<br>
In the **First Week** (Dharma-Statement), the **Distinct Name** (*bié míng*) is "Dharma-Statement." However, the **General** (*tōng*) [nature] possesses all three [modes].
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「如優曇花時一現耳」，即譬說；「若我遇眾生，盡教以佛道」，即因緣說也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
[For example, the line] "Like the *Uḍumbara* flower which appears once in a [long] time" is the **Parable Statement**.<br>
[The line] "If I encounter sentient beings, I teach them all the Buddha Path" is the **Causes and Conditions Statement**.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
中周別名譬說，通則亦三，「我先不言，皆為化菩薩故」。又合譬於一佛乘分別說三，即是法說；
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
In the **Middle Week** (Parable Statement), the **Distinct Name** is "Parable Statement," but the General [nature] also possesses three.<br>
[The line] "I did not speak before, because it was all for converting Bodhisattvas" is the **Causes and Conditions Statement**.<br>
Furthermore, combining the parable [with the meaning] "Within the One Buddha Vehicle, distinguishing and speaking of three," this is the **Dharma-Statement**.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「於二萬億佛所常教化汝」，即因緣說。若謂此文屬法說者，可取長者聞已驚入火宅方宜救濟，即因緣說。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
[The line] "In the place of two-myriad *koṭis* of Buddhas, I constantly taught and converted you," is the **Causes and Conditions Statement**.<br>
If one says this text belongs to the Dharma-Statement, one can take "The Elder heard this and was alarmed, entering the Burning House to expediently save them"—this is the **Causes and Conditions Statement**.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
下周別名宿世因緣，通亦具三，「涅槃時到眾又清淨令入佛慧」，是法說；「有一導師」是譬說，而作三周者，從多從正，從略從傍，欲令名字不濫，各據一意耳。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
In the **Lower Week**, the **Distinct Name** is "Past Causes and Conditions." The General also possesses three.<br>
[The line] "The time for Nirvana has arrived, the assembly is pure again... leading them to enter Buddha Wisdom," is the **Dharma-Statement**.<br>
[The line] "There is a Guide..." is the **Parable Statement**.<br>
Thus, creating [the distinction of] "Three Weeks" follows the **Majority** (*duō*) or the **Correct** (*zhèng*) [aspect], or follows the **Abbreviated** (*lüè*) or the **Secondary** (*báng*). Desiring that the names not be confused, each relies on one [dominant] meaning only.
</div>
</div>

### DIALECTICAL Q&A (Lines 24-30; CBETA 004:24–30)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
問：三周為三根人，一周通有三說者，一說應具三根？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Question:** The Three Weeks are for the people of the Three Roots. If one Week generally possesses [all] three Statements, should one Statement possess [all] Three Roots?
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
答：法說非止逗上中之上，又有中下，從正略傍，故言逗上根人耳，餘二周亦如是。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Answer:** The Dharma-Statement targets not only the Superior (*shàng*) [Root], or the Superior of the Intermediate (*zhōngzhīshàng*); it also possesses [capacity for] the Intermediate and Inferior.<br>
Following the **Correct** [focus] and abbreviating the **Secondary**, generally we say it "targets the people of the Superior Root." The remaining two Weeks are also like this.
</div>

### Meanings 2: Presence or Absence of Voice-Hearers (Lines 32-36; CBETA 004:32–36)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
[1]二、明有聲聞、無聲聞者，光宅定有實行聲聞，若言無實，權何所應。開善解無實行聲聞，引《勝鬘》「三乘初業不愚於法」，外凡已知一乘，寧有二乘猶執小果？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**2. Clarifying the Presence or Absence of Voice-Hearers:**<br>
**Guangzhai** determines there *are* "Real Practice Voice-Hearers" (*shíxíng shēngwén*). [He argues:] If one says there are no Real [Voice-Hearers], to whom does the Provisional [Teaching] respond?<br>
**Kaishan** explains there are *no* Real Practice Voice-Hearers. He cites the *Śrīmālādevī Sūtra*: "Those beginning the practice of the Three Vehicles are not ignorant of the Dharma." [He argues:] If ordinary beings (*wài fán*) already know the One Vehicle, how could there be Two Vehicles who still grasp the Small Fruit?
</div>
</div>
*[Critical apparatus: [1] 二【大】，第二【甲】; [1] 優【大】＊，〔－〕【甲】＊; [＊1-1] 優【大】＊，〔－〕【甲】＊]*


<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
經明有者權也，此二家偏執，乖經失義；若定有者，經那言無聲聞弟子但化諸菩薩？若定無者，誰入化城？亦無三可會，權何所引？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
The **Sutra** clarifies that "Existence" [of Voice-Hearers] is Provisional. These two schools [Guangzhai and Kaishan] hold **Partial Attachments** (*piān zhí*), violating the Sutra and losing the meaning.<br>
If there are definitely [Real Voice-Hearers], how can the Sutra say "There are no Voice-Hearer disciples, I only convert Bodhisattvas"?<br>
If there are definitely *no* [Real Voice-Hearers], who enters the Magic City? There would also be no "Three" to "Converge" (*huì*). What would the Provisional be leading?
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
若言實有為權所引者，亦應實有三藏佛，復為權三藏佛所引；若實無此佛，但有權佛者，何意不許但有權聲聞、無實聲聞耶？此義不例，實有斷界內惑者，呼此為實，而權者應之。何處有斷界內惑佛，而有權佛應此佛？今明有無不可偏執，若從長者實智往觀則無客作人，若就窮子根性則便自謂作人。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
If one says that there are **real** [voice-hearers] as what the **provisional** [teaching] \"responds to,\" then one should likewise say there are **real Tripiṭaka Buddhas**, and that they are again what **provisional Tripiṭaka Buddhas** respond to. If there is no such real Buddha and only provisional Buddhas, why is it not permitted to say that there are only **provisional** voice-hearers and no **real** voice-hearers? The meaning is not analogous: the \"real\" refers to those who have cut off **afflictions within the triple realm** (界內惑), and the provisional corresponds to them. Where is there a Buddha who has cut off afflictions within the triple realm, and yet there is a provisional Buddha responding to that Buddha? Now it is clarified that one must not cling one-sidedly to \"existence\" or \"non-existence\": if one views from the elder’s real wisdom, then there is no hired servant; if one goes by the poor son’s root-capacity, then he himself claims to be a hired servant.

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
《法華論》有四種聲聞：一、決定；二、上慢；三、退大；四、應化。前二未熟不與授記，後二與記。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
The ***Treatise on the Lotus Sutra*** (*Fǎhuá Lùn*)[^6] lists four kinds of Voice-Hearers:<br>
1.  **Determinate** (*juédìng*).<br>
2.  **Overweening** (*shàng màn*).<br>
3.  **Retreating from Great** (*tuì dà*).<br>
4.  **Transformation/Response** (*yìng huà*).<br>
The first two are not yet mature and are not given the Prediction (*shòu jì*). The latter two are given the Prediction.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
若依今經應有五：一、久習小，今世道熟，聞小教證果，如《論》是決定聲聞；
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
If we rely on **this Sutra** [the *Lotus*], there should be **Five**:<br>
1.  Those who have long practiced the Small, and in this life their Way is mature; hearing the Small Teaching they certify the Fruit. This corresponds to the *Treatise*’s "Determinate Voice-Hearer."
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
二、本是菩薩積劫修道，中間疲厭生死，退大取小，《大品》稱為別異善根，佛且成其小道為說小教，齊教斷結取果，是退大未久習小來近，理應易悟，如《論》是退菩提聲聞；
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
2.  Originally a Bodhisattva who cultivated the path through accumulated kalpas, but midway grew weary of birth-and-death, retreated from the Great and took up the Small. The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā* calls this \"distinct-and-different good roots.\" The Buddha first perfects their small path by preaching the small teaching, and—within that teaching—they cut the fetters and obtain the fruit. This is \"retreating from the Great\" but not long practiced in the Small, and thus, coming close again, they should be easy to awaken. In the *Treatise*, this is the \"retreating-from-Bodhi\" voice-hearer.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
三、以此二故，諸佛、菩薩內祕外現，成就引接令入大道，如《論》是應化聲聞；
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
3.  Because of these first two, Buddhas and Bodhisattvas conceal within and manifest without, perfecting [their appearance] as \"guides\" who lead and receive beings into the Great Way. In the *Treatise*, this is the \"response-transformation\" voice-hearer.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
四、若見權實兩種能出生死，欣樂涅槃，修戒定慧，微有觀慧未入似位薄有所得，謂是證果，此名未得謂得、未證謂證，如《論》即是增上慢聲聞；
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
4.  If one sees that both the Provisional and the Real can enable one to go forth from birth-and-death, then one delights in nirvana, cultivates morality, concentration, and wisdom, and has a slight contemplative insight—yet has not entered even the \"resemblance\" position—and has only a thin sense of attainment, but claims it is certification of the fruit: this is called \"not attained yet claiming attainment; not certified yet claiming certification.\" In the *Treatise*, this is precisely the overweening voice-hearer (增上慢).
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
五者、大乘聲聞，以佛道聲令一切聞，若從決定退菩提兩種，即有聲聞，若從大乘理無灰斷永住化城，終歸寶所。實者既爾，則無有權，故無聲聞。若增上慢者，既未入位則非實，又非應化，則非權。若得此意，有無冷然，何須苦諍？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
5.  The Mahāyāna voice-hearer: using the voice of the Buddha-path to cause all to hear. If we proceed from the two types \"determinate\" and \"retreating from Bodhi,\" then there are voice-hearers. If we proceed from the Mahāyāna principle—there is no \"ash-body extinction\"; one abides forever in the Magic City and in the end returns to the Jewel Place. Since \"the real\" is so, then there is no \"provisional,\" and therefore \"no voice-hearers.\" If [we speak of] the overweening [type], since they have not entered a position, they are not \"real\"; and since they are not response-transformations, they are not \"provisional.\" If one grasps this meaning, existence and non-existence are clear and cool—why struggle in dispute?
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
復次秪就大乘聲聞復論有無，若權作應化，外現小迹內隱大德，則謂無大乘聲聞；若從自行發迹顯本，則言有大乘聲聞。今開三顯一正意，為決定退大聲聞令成大乘聲聞，自行既立即能化應聲聞，若得此意則達有無也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Further, speaking only of \"Mahāyāna voice-hearers\" and again discussing existence/non-existence: if one takes the provisional as response-transformation—outwardly manifesting small traces while inwardly hiding great virtue—then one says there are no Mahāyāna voice-hearers. If one proceeds from self-practice—bringing forth traces and revealing the origin—then one says there are Mahāyāna voice-hearers. The central intent of \"opening the three and revealing the one\" is to cause determinate and retreat-from-the-Great voice-hearers to become Mahāyāna voice-hearers. Once self-practice is established, one can then transform response-voice-hearers. If one grasps this meaning, one comprehends \"existence\" and \"non-existence.\"

### Meanings 3: Confusion is Thick or Thin (Lines 36-39; CBETA 004:36–39)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
第三、惑有厚薄者，瑤師云：「三根得果已後遊觀無生。無生之理是一，及其出觀，緣三教則異，將必異之三教，惑於無生之一理，謂教既三，理豈容一？又將一理惑於三教，理既是一，教寧得三？踟蹰理教之間迴遑得失，以理惑教，此有得義；以教惑理，此有失義。上根以理惑教情多，初聞法說順情即悟；下根以教惑理情多，聞法說無三，逆其計謂故三聞乃解；中根處二楹之際，法說不悟，譬說便了。」今謂此釋三根未必應爾，三人踟蹰何等理教？若迴遑小乘理教則疑惑未盡，尚非初果斷結之人；若迴遑大乘理教，大乘條然永異，何曾與小乘相濫而言踟蹰耶？若以小惑大、以大惑小，爾前未斥方便，那忽遊觀出入預有踟蹰？既預踟蹰即已疑生執動，非始今日，若先動執生疑，聞開三顯一即應領解，那忽猶有驚疑？進退無據，故不用此解。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**3. Clarifying if Confusion (*huò*) is Thick or Thin:**<br>
Master Yao says: \"After the Three Roots attain the fruit, they roam and contemplate the Unproduced. The principle of the Unproduced is one. Yet when they come out of contemplation, because they relate to the Three Teachings, they differ. Taking the necessarily-different Three Teachings, they are confused about the one principle of the Unproduced: since the teaching is three, how could the principle permit being one? And again taking the one principle, they are confused about the Three Teachings: since the principle is one, how could the teaching be three? Hesitating between principle and teaching, they turn about, gaining and losing: using principle they confuse the teaching - this has \"gain\"; using the teaching they confuse the principle - this has \"loss.\" The superior root has much feeling of using principle to confuse teaching; on first hearing the Dharma-statement, they accord with their feeling and immediately awaken. The inferior root has much feeling of using teaching to confuse principle; hearing the Dharma-statement that there are \"no three,\" it goes against their counting-thought, so only after hearing three times do they resolve it. The intermediate root stands between the two pillars: the Dharma-statement they do not awaken to, but the parable-statement they readily understand.\"<br><br>
Now I say: This explanation of the Three Roots is not necessarily so. What kind of principle-and-teaching are these three people hesitating over? If they are turning about regarding the Small Vehicle's principle and teaching, then their doubts are not yet ended; they are not even people who have cut the fetters of the first fruit. If they are turning about regarding the Great Vehicle's principle and teaching, the Great Vehicle is plainly and eternally distinct—how could it ever be mixed with the Small Vehicle such that one could speak of \"hesitating\"? If one says the Small confuses the Great, or the Great confuses the Small: before this, expedients had not yet been rebuked—how could they already, while roaming and entering/exiting [contemplation], have had prior hesitations? If they had prior hesitations, then doubts already arose and attachments were already stirred—this would not be beginning only today. If attachment had stirred and doubt had arisen earlier, then hearing \"opening the three and revealing the one\" they should immediately have received understanding—why would there still be startled doubts? Advancing and retreating has no basis; therefore we do not use this explanation.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
今明根有利鈍者，皆論大乘根性，惑有厚薄者，約別惑為言耳，即為四句：一、惑輕根利；二、惑重根利；三、惑輕根鈍；四、惑重根鈍。若別惑輕、大根利，初聞即悟；若惑重根利，再聞方曉；若惑輕根鈍，三聞乃決；第四句雖復三聞不能得悟，止為結緣眾耳。或可初兩句根利同為上根，或可中間兩句為中下根(云云)。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Now, when clarifying if roots are sharp or dull, we are all discussing Mahāyāna root-nature. When discussing whether confusion is thick or thin, we speak with reference to the \"distinct confusion\". Thus there are four phrases: (1) confusion light, root sharp; (2) confusion heavy, root sharp; (3) confusion light, root dull; (4) confusion heavy, root dull. If distinct confusion is light and the great root is sharp, on first hearing one awakens. If confusion is heavy and root is sharp, only upon hearing a second time does one understand. If confusion is light and root is dull, only after hearing three times does one decide. In the fourth phrase, though hearing three times, one still cannot awaken—this is only an assembly for forming karmic ties. Or one may take the first two phrases (sharp roots) together as the superior root; or one may take the middle two phrases as the intermediate and inferior roots (etc.).
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
復次約初品無明三重，覆初住中道，若初法說，上根之人三重無明一時俱盡，開佛知見入菩薩位，得菩提記；中根斷二重無明；下根斷一重。次譬說時，中根斷第三重盡，開佛知見入菩薩位得授記莂；下根進斷二重。次聞因緣說，下根斷三重盡，開佛知見入菩薩位也。例如小乘十六心未滿不得名初果，十六心滿名須陀洹也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Further, with reference to the first chapter: there are three layers of ignorance covering the Middle Way of the First Abode. If, in the initial Dharma-statement, the superior-root person’s three layers of ignorance are all exhausted at once, then they open the Buddha’s knowledge and vision, enter the bodhisattva position, and obtain a Bodhi prediction. The intermediate root cuts off two layers of ignorance; the inferior root cuts off one. Next, in the parable-statement, the intermediate root cuts off the third layer and exhausts it, opens the Buddha’s knowledge and vision, enters the bodhisattva position, and receives the written prediction; the inferior root advances and cuts off two layers. Next, hearing the causes-and-conditions statement, the inferior root cuts off all three layers and exhausts them, opens the Buddha’s knowledge and vision, and enters the bodhisattva position. It is like the Small Vehicle: before the sixteen thought-moments are complete one cannot be named a first-fruit; when the sixteen thought-moments are complete, one is named a srotaāpanna.

### Meanings 4: Turning Roots or Not Turning (Lines 40-49; CBETA 004:40–49)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
四、明轉根不轉根者，舊云：「上根初聞法說即悟，而中根轉同上根，下根進同中根；若譬說時，中根前已成上，即能得悟，下根成上；次因緣說時，下根已同於上故即得悟。」若爾轉下成上，因緣說時皆悉是上，為利則均，那得猶稱鈍者待因緣說耶？若轉成上即同上悟，若其未悟猶受鈍名，則無轉根之義。例如身子一聞，目連再聽，同得初果，若二皆利則無復優劣，若猶稱利鈍，轉根義不成。夫眾生心神不定，遇惡緣轉利為鈍，遇善緣轉鈍為利，先世值佛聞法，自有轉下中為上，俱於法說得悟；自有轉下為中，聞譬說得解；下者不轉，三周乃了。如此轉根不同舊釋。譬三刀斫木，利一、中二、鈍者三下，利鈍之名不失，木斷之處是同。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**4. Clarifying Turning Roots or Not Turning Roots:**<br>
Old explanations say: \"The superior root awakens on first hearing the Dharma-statement, and the intermediate root turns to become the same as the superior root; the inferior root advances to become the same as the intermediate root. If, at the time of the parable-statement, the intermediate root has already become superior, then it can awaken; the inferior root becomes superior. Next, at the time of the causes-and-conditions statement, the inferior root has already become the same as the superior root, thus it can awaken.\" If so—turning the inferior into the superior—then at the time of the causes-and-conditions statement they would all be superior; in benefit they would be equal. How then could it still be called that the dull ones must wait for the causes-and-conditions statement? If they have turned into the superior, they should awaken as the superior does; but if they have not awakened and still receive the name \"dull,\" then there is no meaning of \"turning roots.\" For example: Śāriputra hears once, Maudgalyāyana hears twice, and both obtain the first fruit. If both are sharp, then there is no longer superiority/inferiority; if one still calls them sharp and dull, then the meaning of \"turning roots\" is not accomplished.<br><br>
Now, sentient beings’ minds and spirits are not fixed: encountering bad conditions, they turn from sharp to dull; encountering good conditions, they turn from dull to sharp. In past lives, encountering Buddhas and hearing the Dharma: some turn the inferior and intermediate into the superior, and together awaken upon the Dharma-statement; some turn the inferior into the intermediate and, hearing the parable-statement, obtain understanding; as for the inferior who do not turn, only after three cycles are they clarified. Thus \"turning roots\" is not like the old interpretation.<br><br>
It is like three knives chopping wood: the sharp [cuts] in one stroke, the intermediate in two, the dull in three. The names sharp and dull are not lost, yet the place where the wood is severed is the same.

### Meanings 5: Roots have Awakening or Do Not Have Awakening (Lines 58-69; CBETA 004:58–69)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
五、明有悟不悟者，經中多明菩薩為上根、緣覺中根、聲聞下根，若言菩薩上根，應併在法說中得悟，緣覺併在譬說中得解，聲聞併在於因緣中得悟耶？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**5. Clarifying if Roots Have Awakening or Do Not Have Awakening:**<br>
Sutras often clarify that **Bodhisattvas** are the Superior Root, **Pratyekabuddhas** are the Intermediate Root, and **Voice-Hearers** are the Inferior Root.<br>
If we say Bodhisattvas are the Superior Root, should they all awaken in the **Dharma-Statement**?<br>
Should Pratyekabuddhas all understand in the **Parable-Statement**?<br>
Should Voice-Hearers all awaken in the **Causes and Conditions Statement**?
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
然經中一往判出三根，至於悟解義未必然。今經但見聲聞得解、不見支佛者，支佛是中根，既值佛出世入聲聞數，隨根得悟故，不別標緣覺耳。故身子請偈云：「其求緣覺者，比丘、比丘尼。」依此文即知緣覺入四眾中攝也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
However, while the Sutras generally categorize the Three Roots this way, regarding the meaning of "Awakening and Understanding," it is not necessarily so.<br>
In **this Sutra** [the *Lotus*], we see only Voice-Hearers understanding, but **do not see Pratyekabuddhas** [mentioned separately]. Why?<br>
Pratyekabuddhas are the Intermediate Root. Since they encounter a Buddha appearing in the world, they enter into the number of the Voice-Hearers (*shēngwén shù*). They awaken according to their roots, so the text does not separately mark "Pratyekabuddhas" [as a distinct group].<br>
Therefore, in Śāriputra’s request verse, it says: "**Those seeking the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle, Bhikṣus and Bhikṣuṇīs**..." Relying on this text, we know that Pratyekabuddhas are gathered within the Four Assemblies.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
又〈法師品〉云：「比丘、比丘尼、[1]優婆塞、[＊1-1]優婆夷，求聲聞者、求支佛者」，豈無緣覺得解耶？舊云：「菩薩是上根，不必皆利，從多為上，而執心易轉，原其域懷求佛，但執過三百已即求近果，此疑易悟。三根菩薩同在法說得解，上者或在略說，中者或在廣說之初，下者與身子齊。」今明菩薩語通，但使發大心悉是菩薩，何必併是利根？及身子尚少，豈得初周之前已併得悟？若爾，流通壽量，何意有諸菩薩節節得悟無生忍者、發菩提心者。舊云：「壽量中悟，皆是法身增道損生。」今言不爾，有六百八十萬億那由他恒河沙人得無生法忍，此人始得此忍，當知〈壽量〉之前未是法身，故知菩薩得悟，不可局在初周之初也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Further, the *Dharma-Teacher* chapter says: \"Bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās—those seeking the voice-hearer [way], those seeking the pratyekabuddha [way]\"—how could there be no pratyekabuddhas attaining understanding? Old interpretations say: \"Bodhisattvas are the superior root; they need not all be sharp. Taking the majority as superior, their attached minds are easily turned: originally, within their domain and intent they seek Buddhahood, but after holding attachment past three hundred [times], they then seek a near fruit; this doubt is easy to awaken from. The three-root bodhisattvas all attain understanding within the Dharma-statement: the superior may be in the brief explanation; the intermediate may be at the beginning of the expansive explanation; the inferior is on par with Śāriputra.\" Now I clarify: \"bodhisattva\" is a general term—so long as one generates the great mind, all are bodhisattvas; why must they all be sharp roots? Moreover, Śāriputra is still few—how could [bodhisattvas] already, before the first cycle, all have attained awakening? If it were so, then in the *Entrustment* and *Life-span* [chapters], why would there be bodhisattvas, step by step, attaining the endurance of the unproduced and generating the Bodhi mind? Old interpretations say: \"Those who awaken in the *Life-span* are all dharma-body, increasing the path and diminishing birth.\" Now I say it is not so: there are six hundred and eighty ten-thousand koṭis of nayutas of Ganges-sands people who attain the endurance of the unproduced—these people begin to obtain this endurance. You should know that before the *Life-span* [chapter], they were not yet dharma-body. Therefore we know that bodhisattvas’ awakening cannot be confined to only the beginning of the first cycle.

### Meanings 6: Receiving Understanding or Not Receiving (Lines 71-73; CBETA 004:71–73)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
六、明有領解無領解者，若三乘同悟，何意但見聲聞領解，其二則無？今明無佛出世名獨覺，聞佛說十二因緣法名緣覺，既入聲聞數中得悟領解，皆不別出，大意可見。身子、迦葉等，悉是中乘根性，故聲聞領解兼得緣覺，無勞別出也。又四眾中，有發緣覺心者，其人得悟即不一也，〈信解品〉云：「密遣二人追捉將還」即是其義。菩薩不領解者，聲聞之教不明得佛，今經開其歸大之路，自恐解謬故對佛述解，菩薩不爾故無領解。又其意有三：一、菩薩本意求佛，設有異執而執輕終歸取佛，無有不得之慮，今聞三周之說，但是正其觀慧，故不須領解。二、菩薩悟大，處處有文，二乘作佛始自今教，逐要流傳，故略菩薩領解，[2]胡文或有，漢略不書耳。三、菩薩位行深絕，諸新小菩薩不敢領解，說〈壽量〉竟，彌勒總都領解，初從無生法忍，終訖餘有一生在，則是具足領解，更求何物(云云)？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**6. Clarifying Receiving Understanding (*lǐng jiě*) or Not Receiving Understanding:** If the Three Vehicles all awaken together, why do we only see the voice-hearers receiving understanding while the other two do not? Now: in a world with no Buddha appearing, it is called \"solitary awakening\" (獨覺). Hearing the Buddha preach the twelvefold dependent-arising Dharma is called \"conditioned awakening\" (緣覺). Since they enter the category of voice-hearers and attain awakening and understanding, they are not separately brought out—this general meaning can be seen. Śāriputra, Kāśyapa, and the like are all of the intermediate-vehicle root-nature; therefore, when the voice-hearers receive understanding, it also includes the pratyekabuddhas, and there is no need to list them separately. Further: among the four assemblies, there are those who arouse the pratyekabuddha mind; their attaining awakening is not uniform. The *Faith and Understanding* chapter says, \"secretly sending two people to pursue and bring him back\"—this is the meaning.<br><br>
As for why bodhisattvas do not \"receive understanding\": the voice-hearer teaching did not clarify attaining Buddhahood. Now that this sutra opens the road of returning to the Great, they fear their understanding might be mistaken, and therefore they state their understanding to the Buddha. Bodhisattvas are not like this, and thus they have no \"receiving understanding.\" Further, there are three intentions: (1) Bodhisattvas’ original intent is to seek Buddhahood; even if they have different attachments, those attachments are light and in the end they return to grasp Buddhahood—there is no worry of not attaining it. Now, hearing the teaching of the three cycles simply corrects their contemplative wisdom; thus they do not need to \"receive understanding.\" (2) Bodhisattvas’ awakening to the Great is found everywhere in the text; the Two Vehicles’ becoming Buddhas begins with this present teaching, and as it transmits what is essential, it therefore omits bodhisattva \"receiving understanding.\" Some Indic texts may have it; the Chinese abridges and does not write it. (3) The bodhisattva position and practice are profoundly transcendent; the newly [arisen] small bodhisattvas do not dare to receive understanding. When the *Life-span* chapter is finished, Maitreya comprehensively receives understanding: beginning from the endurance of the unproduced and ending with having one life remaining—this is complete receiving-understanding. What more should one seek (etc.)?

### Meanings 7: Obtaining Prediction or Not Obtaining (Lines 75-84; CBETA 004:75–84)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
七、得記不得記者，若同皆領解，何故聲聞得記，不見緣覺、菩薩受記？此亦三意：一者、昔明二乘入正位不能發心，何由得記？今既悟大，欣斯別決，故為記劫國也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**7. Clarifying Obtaining Prediction (*dé jì*) or Not Obtaining:**<br>
If all equally receive understanding, why do Voice-Hearers receive the Prediction (*vyākaraṇa*), but we do not see Pratyekabuddhas or Bodhisattvas receiving it?<br>
This also has **three meanings**:<br>
1.  **First:** Formerly, it was explained that Two Vehicles entering the **Correct Position** (*zhèng wèi*) could not generate the [Bodhi] Mind. How could they receive a prediction? Now that they have awakened to the Great, they rejoice in this special decision (*bié jué*). Therefore, the Buddha predicts their **Kalpas and Lands** (*jié guó*).
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
菩薩發心求佛行成自滿，故不欣急求佛亦不促授，又前教處處授菩薩記，此是恒說逐要傳譯如前(云云)。二、菩薩亦有別記，調達、龍女豈非記耶？又〈法師品〉云：「求聲聞者、求辟支佛者、求佛道者，如是等類，咸於佛前聞法華經，我皆與授記，當得三菩提。」此豈非皆記耶？三、二乘昔來未曾得八相記，故記其劫國；菩薩先已曾記，故不重明耳。淺近之記初住已得，非菩薩所欣，菩薩所欣乃是圓極妙覺遠記耳。故〈壽量品〉中，始從發心訖一生得，妙因斯滿、極果頓圓，此乃授法身記莂，何謂無記耶？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Bodhisattvas generate the mind to seek Buddhahood; their practice is completed of itself. Therefore, they are not anxious, urgently seeking Buddhahood, nor does the Buddha hastily confer it. Moreover, in the former teachings, predictions for bodhisattvas are conferred everywhere—this is constantly spoken, and, selecting what is essential, it has been transmitted and translated as before (etc.).<br><br>
2.  Bodhisattvas also have particular predictions: are Devadatta and the Dragon Girl not predictions? Further, the *Dharma-Teacher* chapter says: \"Those seeking the voice-hearer [way], those seeking the pratyekabuddha [way], those seeking the Buddha way—such kinds: all, before the Buddha, hear the *Lotus Sutra*; I will all confer predictions on them, and they will attain unsurpassed Bodhi.\" Is this not that all are predicted?<br><br>
3.  The Two Vehicles, from former times until now, have never obtained an \"eight-phase\" prediction; therefore, their kalpas and lands are predicted. Bodhisattvas have already been predicted earlier; therefore it is not repeated. Predictions that are shallow and near—already obtained at the first abode—are not what bodhisattvas rejoice in. What bodhisattvas rejoice in is the far prediction of Perfect Ultimate Marvelous Awakening. Therefore, in the *Life-span* chapter, beginning from first arousing the mind and ending with attaining one-life-remaining: the marvelous cause is thereby fulfilled and the ultimate fruit suddenly rounded—this is a dharma-body prediction. How could one say there is \"no prediction\"?

**Answer:** The eight phases are a prediction of response-manifestation. Since one has obtained the response prediction, one knows there must certainly be an origin. Wishing to make beings know and hear, and to bind together conditions for the future, therefore the response prediction is given. Further: if these Two Vehicles hear the *Life-span* [chapter], then likewise—diminishing birth—they obtain the dharma-body prediction.

### Meanings 8: Awakening is Shallow or Deep (Line 85; CBETA 004:85)

**8. Clarifying if Awakening is Shallow or Deep:**<br>
Generally speaking, all [Three Groups] equally break Ignorance and enter the **First Abode** (*chū zhù*). However, if we examine closely, there must be brightness and obscurity.<br>
If one enters Buddha Wisdom upon first hearing the Dharma-Statement, and then *further* hears the Parable-Statement, how could it not be doubly clear?<br>
Hearing the Causes and Conditions [Statement], the principle naturally increases and advances. Further, hearing the *Life-span* [chapter], it becomes even more superior and deep—like a listener to the Dharma who hears again and surpasses what was heard before. Comparing single and repeated hearings, and thick and thin [confusions], this can be known.

### Meanings 9: Benefit has Provisional and Real (Line 87a; CBETA 004:87a)

**9. Clarifying if Benefit (*yì*) has Provisional (*quán*) and Real (*shí*) Differences:**<br>
One [view] says that the **Real Practice** [Bodhisattvas] obtain benefit, while the **Provisional Practice** [Bodhisattvas] are only for leading and influencing (*yǐngxiǎng*), and we do not discuss their benefit.<br>
**Current Clarification:** It is not so. If we reach the *Life-span* chapter, both Provisional and Real [Bodhisattvas] entirely obtain benefit. Their **Way increases** ever higher, and their **Births decrease** ever more completely. Approaching the Perfect [Result] and bordering the Ultimate, with only one life remaining—is this not the benefit of the Provisional ones?

</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Therefore, initially they [Provisional Bodhisattvas] act as Influencers to help mature the Real Practice; later, when the Ultimate Fruit is spoken, their own Way becomes clear.<br>
The text says: "**Interests** (*xī lì*) [of the trade] spread even to other lands." The interest spreading to others is precisely one's own benefit. The Real Practice obtaining benefit is due to the Provisional's leading. The merit of conversion returns to oneself, so the Provisional also obtains benefit.<br>
Thus, "With one voice He preaches the Dharma, and sentient beings each obtain understanding according to their kind." Why must we wait for the *Life-span* chapter (etc.)? <br>
Furthermore, [the line] "I myself desire to obtain this Great Dharma of True Purity" is precisely **Self-Benefit**.

**10. Clarifying Waiting for Time (*dài shí*) or Not Waiting for Time:**<br>

Those who already understood in the teachings **Before the *Lotus*** are named "**Not Waiting for Time**."<br>
Why is this? The Buddha has **Two Expositions**: **Explicit** (*xiǎn*) and **Secret** (*mì*).

</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">

If we discuss the **Explicit Exposition**: Before the *Lotus*, the Two Vehicles did not awaken to the Great Way. They required the **Five Flavors** to tune and mature them, converging (*huì*) only in the *Lotus*.<br>
Therefore it says: "Because the Time for speaking had not yet arrived, now is exactly the Time; I decisively speak the Great Vehicle." This is **Waiting for Time**.

<div class="english-translation">
If we discuss the **Secret Teaching**: They need not necessarily wait for the Five Flavors to converge only in the *Lotus*. Previously, there were those who secretly entered [the Great Vehicle], thus named **Not Waiting for Time**.<br>
This broadly judges Time and Not Time. Regarding the **Three Weeks**, there is also Waiting for Time and Not Waiting for Time. Regarding the **Two Gates of Trace and Origin** (*jī běn èr mén*), there is also Waiting for Time and Not Waiting for Time. This leads to awakening and entering occurring before and after—this is the meaning.

**Question:** Old interpretations take the **Five Corruptions** (*wǔ zhuó*) as obstructing the Great [Vehicle].

If, on the ground of commonality, one does not cling to nirvana and yet does not hear the Dharma, then ignorance alone is the obstacle. If so: is ignorance broken after hearing the Dharma in the Three Cycles? Or is ignorance broken before hearing the Dharma? If it is broken after hearing, then ignorance was not the obstacle.

答：<br><br>
此經亦云知。文云「若實得羅漢，不信此法無有是處，除佛滅後現前無佛，此人雖生滅度之想，若遇餘佛便得決了。」凡有三意，前明知，次明不知，後會歸知，非永不知。又身子云：「今於佛前皆墮疑惑，我今不知是義所趣。」又大通佛時，聲聞多生疑惑，彼見佛、聞法尚疑不知，況不見聞那忽得知？若執二文更相矛盾，[1]秖增諍競於道何益？論者止可論餘事，聲聞成聖能知、不能知，唯佛境界非爾所[2]諳，今試融之。三乘初業，初業為二，若久遠為初業，曾聞於大則不愚於法；若取中忘，今日學小始修念處，為初業者，是則不知。其義如此。若得此意，權為初業是則能知，實是初業則不能知。有人言「利者能知，鈍者不能知。」此應四句：權為利鈍，示俱不能知；權為利鈍，示俱能知；權為利鈍，聞則能知，不聞不知；權為利鈍，俱示非知、非不知。今不取此判，但取權者內心了了久知，實行者未得入大是故不知，於義自顯(云云)。

**Answer:** This sutra also speaks of \"knowing.\" The text says: \"If one truly attained arhatship, it would be impossible not to believe this Dharma—except after the Buddha’s extinction when there is no Buddha present. Although this person gives rise to the thought of extinction, if they encounter another Buddha they will then decisively understand.\" There are three intentions: first it clarifies knowing; next it clarifies not-knowing; finally it reconciles back to knowing—it is not that they forever do not know. Further, Śāriputra says: \"Now before the Buddha we all fall into doubt; I do not know where this meaning tends.\" And in the time of the Great-Universal-Wisdom-Excellence Buddha, voice-hearers often gave rise to doubt—those people, even seeing the Buddha and hearing the Dharma, still doubted and did not know; how much more so those who do not see or hear—how could they suddenly know? If one clings to these two texts as mutually contradictory, one only increases contention—what benefit is that for the path? One should discuss other matters: whether voice-hearers, becoming sages, can know or cannot know. Only the Buddha’s境界 is not something you can master; now we try to harmonize it.<br><br>
\"Beginning practice\" of the Three Vehicles has two kinds: if one takes \"beginning practice\" as far in the past, then having once heard the Great [Vehicle], one is not ignorant of the Dharma. If one takes it as \"having forgotten the middle\": today learning the Small and only beginning to cultivate mindfulness foundations is \"beginning practice\"—then one does not know. That is the meaning. If one grasps this, then for the provisional, \"beginning practice\" means one can know; for the real, \"beginning practice\" means one cannot know. Some say: \"the sharp can know; the dull cannot know.\" This would correspond to four phrases: with the provisional as sharp/dull, in showing [the teaching] both cannot know; with the provisional as sharp/dull, in showing both can know; with the provisional as sharp/dull, hearing means one can know, not hearing means one does not know; with the provisional as sharp/dull, in showing both are neither knowing nor not-knowing. Now we do not take this judgment. We simply take it that those who are provisional internally clearly know long ago; those who are real practitioners have not yet entered the Great and therefore do not know—this meaning is self-evident (etc.).

**Answer:** The *Treatise* says: \"Of pratyekabuddhas and solitary-awakeners: solitary-awakeners arise in a world without a Buddha; pratyekabuddhas vow to be born in a Buddha-world.\" The *Avataṃsaka* says: \"Bodhisattvas descend from Tuṣita and emit light to illumine them; if they awaken, then they relinquish the body; if they do not awaken, they are moved.\" The *Great Sutra* speaks of comets. The *Madhyamaka* says: \"When pratyekabuddhas appear and the Buddha Dharma has already perished, this is a solitary-awakener person. Those who vow to be born in a Buddha-world first attain the first fruit; if, before fourteen births are complete, they meet a Buddha, they become an arhat; if they do not meet a Buddha, they become a solitary-awakener. If they do meet a Buddha, they neither relinquish life nor are they moved, because they vow to see the Buddha. The second and third fruits are analogous.\" Further, there are \"pratyekabuddhas of the sect-practice\" who, in a world without a Buddha, teach and train as master and disciple. There should be two kinds: after the Buddha has passed, with no written texts and beings’ roots dull, pratyekabuddhas do not preach the Dharma—this is not the sect-practice [type]. The sect-practice [type] can preach the Dharma. Further, there are transformational pratyekabuddhas: to those who should see them, they manifest a pratyekabuddha body. Thus, that there are pratyekabuddhas in the seats of the Three Cycles can be understood.

Master and disciple assessed the capacities—it was not merely stinginess and obstinacy.

**Question:** The Buddha’s great compassion is [boundless]. Why not, by spiritual power, make them remain yet not hear—like the deaf-and-mute in the *Avataṃsaka*? Why not intensify [the teaching] like a poisonous drum—like [the case of] Joyous Root and Victorious Intent?
</div>

<div class="english-translation">
**Answer:** Each has its reason. In the *Avataṃsaka*, only at the final seat is the gradual opened; since small attachments have not yet been broken, they remain in the assembly yet are separated [from hearing/understanding]. Now, the Buddhas’ Dharma, after a long time, is about to speak the true; it is precisely to end the provisional and break the hut, so it is appropriate to select and send them away. If, whether leaving or staying, they would both slander, then one should forcefully speak as with Joyous Root; but now their leaving is beneficial—why make them stay? Their staying would be harmful—why not send them away? Joyous Root, out of kindness, forcefully spoke; the Tathāgata, out of compassion, sends them away.

These people [the 5,000] are also like this. When the *Mahāyāna Parinirvāṇa Sūtra* (*Dà Jīng*) was spoken, 15,000 *koṭis* of people did not generate faith in that Sutra; yet these people will also obtain faith in the future. The benefit lies in the near future.<br>

## III. SPECIFIC EXPLANATION OF THE OPENING (Lines 183-187; CBETA 004:183–187)

<div class="bilingual-row">

從「如是妙法」下，是正廣說，文為二：一、明四佛章，廣上諸佛權實；二、明釋迦章，廣上釋迦權實。上句逗少，是文略；總云諸佛，是人略；但開三顯一，是義略。此中章句多，是文廣；明五佛，是人廣；明六番，是義廣，六者：一、歎法希有，二、說無虛妄，三、開方便，四、示真實，五、舉五濁釋權，六、[＊4-6]揀偽敦實。歎法令生尊重，說無虛謬止其誹謗，開方便使莫執小，示真實使其悟大，舉五濁示必施三，揀偽要必真實。於五章中，一一應備六義，而前後互出不具足者，蓋如來巧說，使略而無闕，詣而不煩文耳。又六義前後亦復無在(云云)。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
From “Such a wonderful Dharma as this …” onward is the proper extensive exposition. The text has two parts: (1) the “chapter on the four Buddhas,” which extensively clarifies the provisional and the real of the Buddhas discussed above; (2) the “chapter on Śākyamuni,” which extensively clarifies the provisional and the real of Śākyamuni discussed above.<br><br>
In the earlier passage, the pauses in the sentences were few—this is brevity of text; it spoke generally of “the Buddhas”—this is brevity of persons; it only opened the three and revealed the one—this is brevity of meaning. Here, sections and sentences are many—this is extensiveness of text; it clarifies five Buddhas—this is extensiveness of persons; it clarifies six “turns”—this is extensiveness of meaning. The six are: (1) praising the Dharma as rare, (2) declaring no falsehood, (3) opening the expedient, (4) showing the real, (5) raising the five corruptions to explain the provisional, (6) selecting the false and urging the real.<br><br>
Praising the Dharma makes one generate reverence; declaring no error or falsehood stops their slander; opening the expedient prevents clinging to the small; showing the real makes them awaken to the great; raising the five corruptions shows that one must employ the three; selecting the false requires that one insist on the real. In the five chapters, each should possess the six meanings; yet because earlier and later passages mutually bring them forth, each chapter is not fully complete [in isolation]. This is the Tathāgata’s skillful speaking: making it brief yet without omissions, reaching the point without making the text burdensome. Moreover, the ordering of the six meanings is also not fixed (etc.).

The “chapter on the four Buddhas” has two parts: first, a general clarification of the Buddhas; second, a listing of the Buddhas of the three times.

The two missing meanings are indicated later in the text. Within “praising the Dharma,” there is a paired praise of Dharma and parable.

</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Regarding “Only then does he speak it”: all Buddhas arise amidst the five corruptions; they must first open the three—as with the present World-Honored One—who only after more than forty years reveals the true. Since it is rare over a long time, it is said “only then does he speak it.” That it is not spoken for a long time is because people are not yet capable, because the time has not yet arrived, and because the five thousand have not yet been sent away. Now people are capable, the time has arrived, and the five thousand have departed; therefore the Great Vehicle is decisively spoken, and thus it says “only then does he speak it.”

<div class="english-translation">
Regarding “You should believe”: this exhorts belief in a Dharma with no falsehood. This principle is extremely deep—its principle differs from before; these words are extremely subtle—the wording runs counter to before; this practice is extremely universal—its practice deviates from before; these persons are extremely supreme—surpassing the former inferior [capacities]. It again points to the four kinds of “hired servants” as coarse in the past, yet now all are subtle; fearing that people will give rise to slander, it therefore exhorts belief. Those who believe are people without falsehood; what is spoken is a Dharma without falsehood.

</div>
<div class="english-translation">
From “according to what is appropriate, he speaks” onward is “opening expedients.” The text has three: opening, explaining, and concluding. First, it clarifies that the Buddha-path, according to three kinds of capacities, speaks expedients; therefore it says “according to what is appropriate.” Yet the Buddha’s intention lies in the real, and beings cannot understand; therefore it says “its intended purport is difficult to understand.” “Why so?” is the explanation: it raises the current Buddha’s provisional capacities to explain the Buddhas’ expedients; since their skillful wisdom is the same, we borrow this [present case] to explain that [other case]. For example, “I use innumerable expedients …” means that all Buddhas open the provisional just as I do.

Regarding “This Dharma is not [something] thought or discrimination can understand”: there are two meanings here. It may be taken as concluding the opening of the provisional; or it may be taken directly as revealing the real. As a conclusion to opening the provisional: the Buddha’s intention is difficult to know; only Buddhas together with Buddhas can fully understand it. Those who receive the teaching call it “three”; the Buddhas know it is “one.”

</div>
<div class="english-translation">
If taken as revealing the real, it belongs to the following text. The text has five: (1) stating the superior person and Dharma, (2) stating the intent of appearing in the world, (3) restating, (4) explaining properly, (5) concluding. “Stating the person and Dharma” means: it raises the non-discriminating Dharma as only known by the Buddha; the Buddha, with non-discriminating wisdom, understands and knows the non-discriminating Dharma—this is revealing the real Dharma.

</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Below “Why so?” the second point—stating the intent of appearing in the world—has two parts: first, a general statement; second, an analysis of the characters. The general statement is: the Buddhas awaken to the mark “as it really is,” and riding this real path they emerge in response within the world; they only cause sentient beings to obtain this Real Mark. They appear in the world solely for this matter—there is no other matter at all. Apart from the Real Mark of dharmas, all else is called “demonic affairs.”

In the analysis of the characters: “one” means the one Real Mark; it is not five, not three, not seven, not nine—therefore it is called “one.” Its nature is broad and expansive, encompassing five, three, seven, and nine; therefore it is called “great.” It is the rite and pattern of the Buddhas’ appearing in the world; therefore it is called an “affair.” Sentient beings have this capacity that moves the Buddha; therefore it is called “cause.” The Buddha rides the capacity and responds; therefore it is called “condition.” This is the fundamental intent of appearing in the world. And the “opening of the three” is only a lure: like a person who wants to take—first one must give; although one speaks various paths, in truth it is for the One Vehicle. This is the meaning.

Below “Śāriputra, how is it?” the third point—restating—means: wishing to differentiate [the meaning], it is again raised as the starting point for explanation. Moreover, this great affair is what the Buddha esteems and honors: as clarified in the *Treatise*, a king-father, wanting the prince-heir to hear his name, repeats it again and again without ever tiring (etc.).

「諸佛世尊」下，第四、正釋者，先出諸解，舊云：「四一，謂：果一、人一、教一、因一。果一者，初兩句據說者，後兩句據受者。就說者，一往於前因門，略說果理，先開佛知見，卒終於後果門廣顯果理，示佛知見。約受者，先因門略開，始得悟解，後果門廣得深入理趣。」今不用此解，何者？經明四句，皆云「為令眾生」，語意悉主前機得益，非關化主，應作所化人開悟，那即分兩句，作能化者開示耶？又正是因門說法，開三顯一之時，那得分出兩句為果門中說耶？果門因緣未會，那得預說？若爾六瑞初興，佛未起定，應是略說；五千未去，應是廣說。二處既其不然，果門安得如此？下方未出，分身未集，那得以因門二句為果門耶？次光宅云：「初一句是開除開出，昔方便說三令除五濁，開出大乘覺悟知見道理。先雖為人開說此理，不說所以，更示況此理令生聞慧。雖聞未悟所以，更廣分別開悟思慧。既信悟得意，即令發心學佛知見，令得修慧入佛知見道理。」今亦不用，何者？汝同舊命章云是果一，四句皆應作果義，云何用三慧消文，因果[1]矛盾前後相違？又三慧多種，此經正破二乘，決定不用三藏中三慧，菩薩方便與二乘同者，蓋是通意，又不可用；[2]若作別三慧，是菩薩法都非佛法；若作圓三慧，圓三慧[3]來開佛知見，消經不可；若作餘三慧，去經逾遠；若作圓三慧，果一義不成。都不可用(云云)。次地論師云：「第五恒沙得八分解，即三十心位為開，從初地至六地，見思盡解轉分明如示，七地至八地，空有並觀無礙如悟，十地為入，引經十地名為眼見。」今亦不用，何者？此經明開佛知見，佛以一切種智知，佛以佛眼見，開此智眼乃名佛知見，云何取第五恒沙生八分解，猶未入地稱之為開？如此論開非開佛眼，如此之知非一切種智知，不與經會故不用(云云)。有人解：「初句是理，後三句是略解，謂八苦、五濁障當果是閉，今教除五濁，佛果知見顯故名開，穢累除而理顯名清淨，後三句是聞思修。」難此同前。有人言：「三乘別教為開，三乘通教為示，抑揚[4]為悟，《法華》為入。」又人解：「三乘通為開，抑揚為示，無量義為悟，《法華》為入。」此二解擘三句向他經，裂一句置《法華》，擘裂穿鑿，傷害誣誷其過大矣！有人言：「三十心是開，初地至六地為示，七地至九地為悟，十地為入。」此人傍通挾別，作如此語，未見《法華》奇異，何俟稱歎耶？有人引《華嚴》、《纓珞》、《仁王》、《攝大乘》、《十七地論》五凡夫等皆有五十二位，地前有四十心，何不用之？此人謬引《華嚴》，《華嚴》不明十信，縱使諸部明地前四十心位者，皆非斷道，何因用此解開佛知見，皆漫語耳。有人引《釋論》四智總別一時而得。不應用此解開示悟入，開示悟入似有淺深；又四智位高，開示通淺深，此應非例。此人但見《釋論》四智之一時，不見開示之一時。有人言：「非空非有是開，能空能有是示，空有不二是悟，了空有不二而二是入。」此人約二諦作解，尚不能拔出二乘，寧是《法華》一意？有人言：「達三諦理為開，三諦分明為示，不見三諦一異為悟，任運順流為入也。」此人約邐迤三諦作義，尚不出菩薩法，寧是佛法？有人解：「佛知見者，一切智總相為知，一切種智別相為見。」此亦不然，《釋論》明一切智是聲聞智，道種智是菩薩智，一切種智是佛智。此是歷別一切種智，非三智在一心中，何以二乘之知、別佛之見，釋圓佛知見耶？有人解：「盡智煩惱清淨名知，無生智因果患累畢竟無生名見。」此人取通家佛名教，解究竟佛，都不相應。如上諸師漫取諸經中語，都不見《法華》大意。

<div class="english-translation">
Below “All Buddhas, World-Honored Ones …,” the fourth point—proper explanation—first presents various interpretations. An older explanation says: “There are four ‘ones’: fruit-one, person-one, teaching-one, and cause-one. As to fruit-one: the first two sentences are from the side of the one who speaks; the latter two are from the side of the one who receives. From the speaker’s side: broadly within the earlier cause-gate, it briefly speaks the fruit-principle—first ‘opening Buddha knowledge-and-vision,’ and finally, within the later fruit-gate, extensively manifesting the fruit-principle and ‘showing Buddha knowledge-and-vision.’ From the receiver’s side: first, in the cause-gate, it briefly opens and one begins to awaken and understand; later, in the fruit-gate, one extensively attains deeper penetration into the principle.”<br><br>
Now we do not use this explanation. Why? The sutra’s four sentences all say “in order to cause sentient beings …” The wording’s intention wholly concerns the prior capacities obtaining benefit; it does not concern the one who transforms. It should be that the transformed persons are opened and awakened—how could one divide it into two sentences and take them as the transformer’s “opening and showing”? Moreover, this is precisely the time of teaching in the cause-gate, “opening the three and revealing the one”—how could one separate two sentences as being spoken in the fruit-gate? The causal conditions of the fruit-gate have not yet converged—how could it be spoken in advance? If it were so, then when the six portents first arose and the Buddha had not yet entered samādhi, it should be “brief speaking”; and when the five thousand had not yet departed, it should be “extensive speaking.” Since neither of these is the case, how could the fruit-gate be like that? The earth has not yet opened below and the emanated bodies have not yet assembled—how could one take the two sentences of the cause-gate as belonging to the fruit-gate?<br><br>
Next, Guangzhai says: “The first sentence is ‘opening-away’ and ‘opening-forth’: formerly, expediently preaching three removes the five corruptions; [now] it opens forth the Mahāyāna and awakens the principle of knowledge-and-vision. Though previously it opened and preached this principle for people, it did not explain the ‘why’; thus it further ‘shows’ this principle and makes hearing-wisdom arise. Though one hears, if one has not yet awakened to the ‘why,’ it further extensively differentiates and awakens thinking-wisdom. Having already believed and awakened to the meaning, it then makes one arouse the mind to study Buddha knowledge-and-vision, attain cultivation-wisdom, and enter the principle of Buddha knowledge-and-vision.” Now we also do not use this. Why? You, like the older chapter-labeling, call it fruit-one—then the four sentences should all be fruit-meaning. How could one use the three wisdoms to interpret the text, making cause and fruit contradictory and inconsistent before and after? Moreover, there are many kinds of three wisdoms. This sutra is precisely breaking the two vehicles: it definitely does not use the three wisdoms of the Tripiṭaka. And the bodhisattva expedient that is shared with the two vehicles is only a general/shared idea and likewise cannot be used. If one takes it as the “distinct three wisdoms,” that is bodhisattva-dharma and not Buddha-dharma at all. If one takes it as the “perfect three wisdoms,” the perfect three wisdoms come to open Buddha knowledge-and-vision, and thus cannot be used to interpret this sutra. If one takes other three-wisdoms, one departs from the sutra ever farther; if one takes it as perfect three-wisdoms, fruit-one does not stand. In every case, it cannot be used (etc.).<br><br>
Next, the Dilun masters say: “The fifth 恒沙 [bodhisattvas] attain an eight-part understanding; the position of the thirty minds is ‘opening.’ From the first ground to the sixth, when view and thought are exhausted, understanding becomes progressively clearer—this is like ‘showing.’ From the seventh ground to the eighth, contemplation of emptiness and existence is both performed without obstruction—this is like ‘awakening.’ The tenth ground is ‘entering,’ citing that the sutra names the tenth ground ‘eye-seeing.’” Now we also do not use this. Why? This sutra clarifies opening Buddha knowledge-and-vision: the Buddha knows with all-kinds wisdom and sees with the Buddha-eye; opening this wisdom-and-eye is then called Buddha knowledge-and-vision. How could one take the fifth 恒沙 producing an eight-part understanding—still not having entered the grounds—and call it “opening”? In such a theory, “opening” is not opening the Buddha-eye; and such “knowing” is not the knowing of all-kinds wisdom. It does not accord with the sutra, so it is not used (etc.).<br><br>
Some explain: “The first sentence is principle; the latter three sentences are a brief explanation: namely, the eight sufferings and five corruptions obstruct the fruit and are ‘closed’; now the teaching removes the five corruptions, the Buddha-fruit knowledge-and-vision appears, hence it is called ‘open’; defilements are removed and the principle appears, hence it is ‘pure’; and the latter three sentences are hearing, thinking, and cultivation.” This is refuted as the same as the foregoing. Some say: “The distinct teaching of the three vehicles is opening; the shared teaching of the three vehicles is showing; suppression-and-praise is awakening; and the Lotus is entering.” Another explains: “The shared teaching of the three vehicles is opening; suppression-and-praise is showing; *Infinite Meaning* is awakening; and the Lotus is entering.” These two explanations split three sentences toward other sutras and tear one sentence to place in the Lotus—splitting and chiseling, with a great fault of harm and slander!<br><br>
Some say: “The thirty mind-positions are opening; the first ground to the sixth is showing; the seventh to the ninth is awakening; and the tenth ground is entering.” This person sideways takes shared and smuggles in distinct. They have not seen the Lotus’s extraordinary character—why wait to praise it? Some cite *Avataṃsaka*, *Yingluo*, *Renwang*, *She Dasheng*, and the *Seventeen-Ground Treatise*: that five types of ordinary beings, etc., all have fifty-two positions, with forty mind-positions before the grounds—why not use these? This is a mistaken citation of *Avataṃsaka*: *Avataṃsaka* does not explain the ten faiths. Even if various schools speak of forty mind-positions before the grounds, all of them are not the cutting-off path; on what grounds can one use this to interpret “opening Buddha knowledge-and-vision”? These are all empty words.<br><br>
Some cite the *Treatise* that the four wisdoms, general and particular, are attained at one time. One should not use this to interpret “opening, showing, awakening, and entering,” since opening/showing/awakening/entering seems to have shallow and deep; moreover, the four-wisdom stages are lofty, while opening/showing can span shallow/deep—this is not analogous. Such people only see the “one-time” of the four wisdoms in the *Treatise* and do not see the “one-time” of opening and showing. Some say: “Neither empty nor existent is opening; able to empty and able to exist is showing; non-dual emptiness-and-existence is awakening; realizing non-duality yet still two is entering.” Explaining by the two truths, they still cannot pull one beyond the two vehicles—how could it be the Lotus’s one intent? Some say: “To reach the principle of the three truths is opening; the three truths being distinct is showing; not seeing the one/different of the three truths is awakening; spontaneously flowing along is entering.” Using a gradual three-truths for the meaning, they still do not go beyond bodhisattva-dharma—how could it be Buddha-dharma?<br><br>
Some explain: “As to Buddha knowledge-and-vision: all-knowledge, in its general aspect, is ‘knowledge’; all-kinds wisdom, in its particular aspect, is ‘vision’.” This too is not so: the *Treatise* clarifies that all-knowledge is voice-hearer wisdom, path-seed wisdom is bodhisattva wisdom, and all-kinds wisdom is Buddha wisdom. This is a stepwise, separate all-kinds wisdom—not the three wisdoms within one mind. How could one use the “knowledge” of the two vehicles and a “vision” separately assigned to the Buddha to explain the perfect Buddha knowledge-and-vision? Some explain: “Exhaustion-wisdom—afflictions purified—is called knowledge; non-arising-wisdom—where the sufferings of cause and fruit are ultimately non-arising—is called vision.” This takes the Buddha-name teaching of the shared school to explain the ultimate Buddha and does not correspond at all. As above, the masters indiscriminately pick phrases from various sutras and do not see the great intent of the Lotus.

The *Treatise on the Lotus Sutra* says: “(1) the meaning of ‘unsurpassed’: apart from all-knowledge there is no other matter; as the sutra says, it opens Buddha knowledge-and-vision and appears in the world in order to cause sentient beings to attain purity; (2) the meaning of ‘sameness’: voice-hearers and pratyekabuddhas are equal in Buddha-nature and dharmakāya; as the sutra says, it appears in the world to show sentient beings Buddha knowledge-and-vision, because Buddha-nature and dharmakāya have no further difference; (3) the meaning of ‘not knowing’: the two vehicles do not know that ultimately there is only the One Buddha Vehicle; as the sutra says, it appears in the world to awaken [them] to Buddha knowledge-and-vision; (4) the meaning of enabling one to certify the non-retrogressive ground and to manifest the karmic work of immeasurable wisdom; as the sutra says, it appears in the world to cause sentient beings to enter Buddha knowledge-and-vision.”<br><br>
The treatise speaks in sequence: first, opening Buddha knowledge-and-vision is the unsurpassed; second, showing that the three vehicles all share Buddha-nature and dharmakāya—although Buddha wisdom is unsurpassed, it fears people will think the Buddha alone has it, so second it clarifies that the three vehicles also share it; although the three vehicles share it, the two vehicles do not awaken to it, so it “shows” to make them know; although they know, they cannot yet attain non-retrogression, so the fourth makes them attain non-retrogression.<br><br>
Another set is “with respect to bodhisattvas”: opening is as above; showing means that for bodhisattvas with doubts, it causes them to know and to cultivate practice in accord with reality; awakening means that those who have not yet aroused the bodhi-mind are caused to arouse it; entering means that those who have already aroused the bodhi-mind are caused to enter the Dharma. A third set is “with respect to ordinary beings”: opening is as above; showing means showing that they have dharmakāya and Buddha-nature; awakening means causing non-Buddhist beings to awaken; entering means causing them to enter great bodhi.

The current master’s four explanations do not conflict with the *Treatise*: the *Treatise* explains sentence by sentence, while here one sentence is explained as four; the *Treatise* clarifies “certifying the non-retrogressive ground,” while here it is explained as the four positions; the *Treatise* says the Tathāgata can certify the real, while here it is explained as the four wisdoms; the *Treatise* clarifies “the meaning of sameness,” while here it is explained as contemplation of mind; the *Treatise* clarifies “the meaning of not knowing the ultimate,” while here it is explained as the four gates (etc.).<br><br>
Now, in explaining “revealing the real,” immeasurable dharmas are all one. As the *Xuányì*’s “ten subtleties” are ten kinds of subtlety, they are also ten kinds of “oneness.” If one harmonizes with the old explanation, one may temporarily speak of “four ones.” If one speaks of immeasurable ones, then in “one color” and “one scent” there is nothing that is not the Middle Way—this meaning can be understood. If one makes “eleven,” the textual fit is complete; although it is not in strict sequence, the ten meanings are not reduced. Why? “I use innumerable expedients and various causes and conditions to expound the dharmas”—this is itself a passage of opening the provisional. From “This Dharma is not what thought and discrimination can understand” one reveals principle-one; from “Only the Buddhas can know it” one reveals wisdom-one; in “Only for one great affair,” one must distinguish slightly: “one” is principle, “great” is wisdom, and “affair” is practice—principle gives rise to wisdom, wisdom guides practice; following this meaning, it is “revealing practice-one.” As for “knowledge and vision”: wisdom knows the principle, and the eye sees the truths; since the truths are unconditioned, there is no discrimination, and because they are unconditioned there are distinctions. On this basis, using knowledge-and-vision to speak of opening/showing/awakening/entering: if one uses the brief to analogize the extensive, there are forty positions—this is revealing position-one. Further, taking the four concluding sentences to clarify “one”: “one” is dharmakāya, “great” is prajñā, and “affair” is liberation—this is the secret store and thus reveals the three dharmas as one. “Appearing in the world” reveals response-and-resonance as one; “only transforming bodhisattvas” reveals retinue as one; “all that is done” reveals supernormal powers as one; “only using the Buddha’s knowledge and vision to show and awaken beings” reveals benefit as one; “only using the one Buddha vehicle to preach for beings” reveals preaching as one. The sutra’s wording seals the meaning as matching tallies.<br><br>
If one briefly harmonizes with the old as “four ones,” the number is the same but the meanings differ. The old says fruit-one; here it is principle-one—following both meaning and text. Following meaning: if there is no principle-one, then all affairs are inverted and are all demonic talk, no longer Buddha-sūtra—therefore principle-one is necessary. Following the text: the text calls it Buddha knowledge-and-vision; here we take what is known and what is seen—what is seen is the truths, what is known is the object; the object and the truths are the principle of Real Mark, therefore it is called principle-one. The old says cause-one; here it is practice-one: “cause” is a single word with a narrower meaning, whereas “practice-one” broadly gathers cause and fruit, therefore it is called practice-one. Person-one and teaching-one are the same as in that [old explanation].

</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Now, for the moment speaking briefly, we use the Four Ones to interpret the text. First, we explain principle-one, and further give four intentions: (1) in terms of four positions, (2) in terms of four wisdoms, (3) in terms of four gates, (4) in terms of contemplating mind.<br><br>
1) In terms of four positions: the realm of truths cannot be known or seen; only by means of the wisdom-eye can it be known and seen. The two wisdoms and four eyes cannot know and see it; only all-kinds wisdom—the Buddha-eye—can know and see it. The sutra says “in order to cause sentient beings to open Buddha knowledge and vision”; it is not discussing the Buddha-fruit’s self-knowing and self-seeing. If one speaks only of the Buddha-fruit, one loses sentient beings; if one speaks only of sentient beings, then there would be no Buddha knowledge and vision—therefore one cannot take either side alone. Practitioners of the three teachings are indeed sentient beings, but since they do not yet have the Buddha-eye and Buddha-wisdom, they cannot know and see Real Mark. The four positions of the perfect teaching are also sentient beings, and yet they partially obtain the Buddha-eye and Buddha-wisdom; thus the “sentient being” meaning is fulfilled and the “knowledge and vision” meaning is fulfilled as well. Therefore we temporarily rely on these four positions to explain principle-one. It is like, in the auspicious portent, the heavenly rain of four flowers indicates that the myriad virtues return together and attain entry into the four positions; riding the flowers of the four positions to approach the Buddha-fruit. Therefore one reveals principle in terms of position.<br><br>
“Opening” is the first breaking of ignorance in the ten dwellings: opening the tathāgata-storehouse and seeing the principle of Real Mark. Why? The principle of innate virtue is stained by the two confusions of shared and distinct, and is difficult to fully know. At the beginning, one can perfectly believe, perfectly receive, and perfectly subdue, but cannot yet cut [the confusions]—this is not called “opening.” One must internally add contemplative practice and externally rely on the aid of Dharma-rain, break the storehouse of shared-and-distinct confusions, and manifest true cultivated nature; knowledge and vision open forth clearly—like the sun rising and darkness perishing so that eyes have function—therefore it is called “opening.” Because one breaks confusion through conditions-cultivation, it is called “causing [them] to become pure.” The *Renwang* says: “Entering principle prajñā is called dwelling”—dwelling in the ten dwellings, the “small white flower” position.<br><br>
“Showing” is when confusion-obstacles have been removed and the substance of knowledge and vision is manifest; its substance is endowed with myriad virtues, and the virtues of the Dharma-realm are displayed distinctly—therefore it is called “showing.” This is the ten practices, the “great white” position. “Awakening” is when obstacles are removed, the substance is manifest, and the practice of the Dharma-realm is bright; phenomenon and principle are fused and there is no second destination. The *She Dasheng* master says: “as-principle wisdom and as-measure wisdom.” Now, since principle and measure are not two, it is called “awakening.” This is the ten dedications, the “small red” position. “Entering” is when phenomenon and principle have fused and there is自在 without obstruction; it flows freely and spontaneously, from A to Cha entering the sea of omniscience. As the *She Dasheng* master says: “as-principle and as-measure, penetrating and自在.” As-measure knowledge and vision can uphold the virtues of beings; as-principle knowledge and vision can block the confusions. This is the ten grounds, the “great red” position.<br><br>
Yet on the perfect path’s subtle positions, within a single position are already present the virtues of forty-one grounds; [＊1-2] merely in “opening” one already contains showing/awakening/entering, etc. It is not another mind; it is only as-principle knowledge and vision, without discriminating shallow and deep. In order to manifest as-measure knowledge and vision, they are distinguished as four positions. The initial and the final minds are not separate; yet since it speaks of difficulty and ease, one knows that between the initial mind and the final mind there are differences of brightness/darkness and shallow/deep—like the moon’s body is round both at beginning and end, yet there is the difference of new moon and full moon. The knowledge and vision of the four positions all clearly illumine the Real Mark, yet they are spoken of as different in “opening” and “entering” (etc.).

2) In terms of the four wisdoms: now, wishing to match the perfect teaching’s four wisdoms with the four positions, it is not like the shared-teaching interpretation in the *Prajñā*. (1) Path-wisdom sees the path’s real nature; within that real nature one obtains opening Buddha knowledge-and-vision. (2) Path-seed wisdom knows the distinct characteristics of the path-seeds of the ten dharma-realms and the confusions of distinct understanding; each and every one displays Buddha knowledge-and-vision. (3) All-knowledge knows that all dharmas are of one mark of quiescent extinction; that quiescent extinction is awakening to Buddha knowledge-and-vision. (4) All-kinds wisdom knows the quiescent-extinction mark of all dharmas and recognizes the various types and appearances of practices; this is entering Buddha knowledge-and-vision. Again: path-wisdom, as-principle, is called opening; path-seed wisdom, as-measure, is called showing; all-knowledge, with principle and measure not two, is called awakening; all-kinds wisdom, with principle and measure doubly illumined, is called entering. This too: within the real principle there is no shallow or deep, yet shallow/deep are distinguished.

三、約圓教四門橫釋四句者，空門，一空一切空，即開佛知見；有門，一有一切有，即示佛知見也；亦空亦有門，一切亦空亦有，即悟佛知見也；非空非有門，一切非空非有，即入佛知見。能通則四，所通則一，開示悟入是能通之門，所知所見是所通之理也。

3) In terms of the perfect teaching’s four gates, interpreting the four sentences “crosswise”: the empty gate—one emptiness, all empty—is opening Buddha knowledge-and-vision; the existent gate—one existence, all existent—is showing Buddha knowledge-and-vision; the both-empty-and-both-existent gate—everything both empty and both existent—is awakening to Buddha knowledge-and-vision; the neither-empty-nor-existent gate—everything neither empty nor existent—is entering Buddha knowledge-and-vision. The “able-to-penetrate” is four; what is “penetrated” is one. Opening/showing/awakening/entering are the gates that penetrate; what is known and what is seen are the principle that is penetrated.

四、約觀心釋者，觀於心性三諦之理不可思議，此觀明淨，名為開；雖不可思議，而能分別空、假、中心，宛然無濫，名為示；空、假、中心，即三而一、即一而三，名為悟；空、假、中心，非空、假、中，而齊照空、假、中，名為入。是為一心三觀而分開示悟入之殊也。

4) In terms of contemplating mind: one contemplates the inconceivable principle of the three truths of mind-nature. When this contemplation is bright and pure, it is called opening. Though inconceivable, it can still distinguish emptiness, provisionality, and the middle—clearly and without confusion; this is called showing. Emptiness/provisionality/the middle are: three and yet one, one and yet three; this is called awakening. Emptiness/provisionality/the middle are neither emptiness, nor provisionality, nor middle, and yet illumine emptiness/provisionality/the middle together; this is called entering. This is to take one mind and three contemplations and distinguish the differences of opening/showing/awakening/entering.

### Clarifying Teaching One and Action One (Lines 212-219)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
所以四種釋者，見理由位，位立由智，智發由門，門通由觀；觀故則門通，門通故智成，智成故位立，位立故見理，見理故名為理一也。從「舍利弗是為諸佛以一大事」下，即是結成理一義也。昔方便教，亦得義論開示悟入，而非佛知見，故是權；今明佛知見，故是實，實即理一也。從「告舍利弗，如來但教化菩薩」是明人一，就昔方便，謂教化三乘，理實而言但化菩薩。如彼窮子自謂客作賤人，長者所觀實為己子，即是人一也。從「諸有所作常為一事」，光宅稱教一，今言行一。諸三乘眾行名之為諸，為圓故諸，即是一事。此行何所至到？唯趣佛之知見，即是行一意也。亦可持此為教一，若就教主為言，諸有所作唯以教化為事，此教一為便。若就行人為語，所作之事，事作即是行，今取此便呼為行一也。然四句皆二義，至如理一中，若取能知見，即位一為便；所知見，理一為便。人一句中若取教化，教一為便；若取菩薩，人一為便。教一句中，若取以一佛乘而為眾生說法，此教一為便；若取乘運之義，行一為便。四句通然，逐便釋耳。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Therefore, in the four kinds of explanation: seeing principle comes from position; position is established by wisdom; wisdom arises from gate; and the gate penetrates by contemplation. Because of contemplation the gate penetrates; because the gate penetrates wisdom is accomplished; because wisdom is accomplished position is established; because position is established one sees principle; because one sees principle it is called principle-one. From “Śāriputra, this is for the Buddhas … one great affair …” onward is the concluding establishment of the meaning of principle-one. Formerly, the expedient teachings could also speak of opening/showing/awakening/entering in meaning, but it was not Buddha knowledge-and-vision; therefore it was provisional. Now it clarifies Buddha knowledge-and-vision; therefore it is real—and the real is precisely principle-one.<br><br>
From “Tell Śāriputra, the Tathāgata only teaches and transforms bodhisattvas” is clarifying person-one. In terms of the former expedient, it was said to teach and transform the three vehicles; in real meaning, it only transforms bodhisattvas. It is like the poor son thinks himself a hired low person, while the elder regards him as truly his own son—this is person-one.<br><br>
From “All that is done is always for one affair,” Guangzhai calls it teaching-one; here we call it practice-one. The myriad practices of the three vehicles are called “all”; because it is the perfect, the “all” is precisely one affair. Where does this practice go? It goes only toward the Buddha’s knowledge and vision—this is the meaning of practice-one. One may also take this as teaching-one: if one speaks from the teacher’s side, all that is done takes teaching and transforming as the affair; then teaching-one is a convenient interpretation. If one speaks from the practitioner’s side, what is done is the affair; when the affair is done, that is practice—here, taking this convenience, it is called practice-one.<br><br>
However, each of the four sentences has two meanings, and one interprets according to what is convenient. For example, within principle-one: if one takes the “able-to know-and-see,” then position-one is the convenient interpretation; if one takes what is known and what is seen, then principle-one is convenient. In the person sentence: if one takes teaching-and-transforming, teaching-one is convenient; if one takes “bodhisattvas,” person-one is convenient. In the teaching sentence: if one takes “using only one Buddha vehicle to preach for sentient beings,” teaching-one is convenient; if one takes the meaning of “vehicle conveying and operating,” practice-one is convenient. The four sentences are all like this.

從「但以一佛乘」者，光宅為因一，今言教一。圓頓之教，名一佛乘，故〈序品〉云「說大乘經」即是教義也，自別教已去，皆名有餘之說，即不了義非佛一乘。光宅云：「無緣覺、聲聞之二，無偏行菩薩之三。」又有人云：「無菩薩、緣覺為無二，無聲聞為無三。」若作此解，[＊1-3]秖是無三藏諸乘、存於通乘，何關一佛乘耶？有人言：「無緣覺為無二，無聲聞為無三，存於菩薩大乘。」若爾[＊1-4]秖無三藏中二乘，不無三藏中菩薩，此存有餘，何關佛乘？何處經論以聲聞為第三？既無此次第，都是妄說。若依汝解，無二是無緣覺，無三是無菩薩，第一是聲聞應不被無；若如此者則大倒亂。今言「但以一佛乘」者，純說佛法之圓教乘也。「無餘乘」者，無別教帶方便有餘之說。「無二」者，無《般若》中之帶二。「無三」者，無方等中所對之三也。如此二三皆無，況三藏中三耶？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
From “Only with the one Buddha vehicle …,” Guangzhai takes it as cause-one; here it is teaching-one. The round-and-sudden teaching is called the one Buddha vehicle; therefore the *Introductory Chapter* says “preaching the Mahāyāna sutra”—this is precisely the meaning of teaching. From the Distinct Teaching onward, all are called “with-remainder” teachings; they are non-definitive and not the Buddha’s one vehicle.<br><br>
Guangzhai says: “No pratyekabuddha and voice-hearer is ‘no two’; no one-sided-practice bodhisattva is ‘no three.’” Another says: “No bodhisattva and pratyekabuddha is ‘no two’; no voice-hearer is ‘no three.’” If interpreted this way, [＊1-3] it is only negating the Tripiṭaka vehicles and preserving the Shared vehicle—what does that have to do with the one Buddha vehicle? Some say: “No pratyekabuddha is ‘no two’; no voice-hearer is ‘no three’; preserving the bodhisattva Mahāyāna.” If so, [＊1-4] it only negates the two vehicles within the Tripiṭaka and does not negate the Tripiṭaka bodhisattva; this preserves “with remainder”—what does that have to do with the Buddha vehicle? Where do sutras or treatises take voice-hearers as “the third”? Since there is no such ordering, these are all false explanations. If we follow your explanation—“no two” is no pratyekabuddha, “no three” is no bodhisattva—then the “first” would be voice-hearers and should not be negated; if so, it is utterly inverted and confused.<br><br>
Here, “only with the one Buddha vehicle” means purely speaking the Round Teaching vehicle of the Buddha-dharma. “No other vehicles” means there is no Distinct Teaching with expedient “with-remainder” sayings. “No two” means there is no “with-two” in the *Prajñā*. “No three” means there is no “facing-three” in the Vaipulya. If these two and three are absent, how much more so the three vehicles of the Tripiṭaka?

### Conclusion of General Explanation (Lines 219-229)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
從「舍利弗一切十方諸佛法亦如是」，即是第五總[1]結。三世佛章各明教一、行一，後總論人一、理一，在文可見。若當章自作四一者亦得，而不及總文顯也，《菩薩纓珞經》第十三，明九世佛，過去三世佛，現、未亦爾。未來三世佛者，古佛慈悲入未來，作種種形度眾生者是；未來現在佛者，當受未來記者是；未來未來佛者，當佛轉次受記者是。過去準此可知(云云)。現在現在佛者，當化主者是；現在未來佛，次補者是；現在過去佛，古佛垂迹者是。從過去諸佛章，此中應具六義，但出二種：一、開方便，二、顯真實。兩則指上，兩則指下。「以無量無數方便」者明開權也，「是法皆為一佛乘故」明顯實也，例上一佛乘即是教一；「從諸佛聞法」，是雖聞於法，法被眾生兼得人一；「究竟皆得一切種智」，種智所知即是理一，能知即是行一。雖不次第，四一兼足也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
From “Śāriputra, the Dharma of all Buddhas of the ten directions is also like this” is the fifth overall conclusion. In the chapters on the Buddhas of the three times, each clarifies teaching-one and practice-one; afterward, it generally discusses person-one and principle-one—this can be seen in the text. If, within that chapter, one wished to make four ones by oneself, that is also possible, but it does not display as clearly as the overall text.<br><br>
The *Bodhisattva Yingluo Sutra* (fascicle 13) clarifies “nine world-ages Buddhas”: the three past ages Buddhas, and the present and future are analogous. As for the future three ages Buddhas: “future-of-past” Buddhas are the ancient Buddhas who, out of compassion, enter the future and take various forms to liberate beings; “future-of-present” Buddhas are those who are about to receive a future prediction; “future-of-future” Buddhas are those who, when they become Buddhas, will in turn receive predictions. The past can be understood analogously (etc.). As for the present three ages: “present-of-present” Buddha is the current transforming leader; “present-of-future” Buddha is the next-in-line (the successor); “present-of-past” Buddha is an ancient Buddha letting down a trace manifestation.<br><br>
From the chapter on past Buddhas, here one should have six meanings, but only two are brought forth: (1) opening expedients, (2) revealing the real. Two point upward; two point downward. “With immeasurable innumerable expedients …” clarifies opening the provisional; “these dharmas are all for the sake of the one Buddha vehicle” clarifies revealing the real. Analogously, above: the one Buddha vehicle is teaching-one. “Having heard the Dharma from the Buddhas”: although they have heard the Dharma, the Dharma is for sentient beings, and thus person-one is also obtained. “Ultimately all attain all-kinds wisdom”: what all-kinds wisdom knows is principle-one; the knower is practice-one. Though not in strict sequence, the four ones are all fully present.

#### FOOTNOTES

[^1]: **Seven and a Half Chapters:** Refers to the *Lotus Sutra* text from the *Expedient Means* chapter (Chapter 2) through the *Prophecies Conferred on Learners and Adepts* (Chapter 9). This section constitutes the "Trace Gate" teaching of Opening the Three to Reveal the One.
[^2]: **Upper:** Fascicle 4 is typically divided into "Upper" and "Lower" parts in printed editions due to length.
[^3]: **Three Weeks (Sān Zhōu 三周):** Zhiyi's exegetical structure for the *Lotus Sutra*. (1) **Dharma Week** (*Fǎ shuō*): Direct teaching (Ch. 2). (2) **Parable Week** (*Pì shuō*): Teaching via story (Ch. 3-4). (3) **Causes and Conditions Week** (*Yīnyuán shuō*): Teaching via past lives (Ch. 7-9).
[^4]: **Uḍumbara Flower:** A mythical flower said to bloom only once every 3,000 years, symbolizing the rarity of a Buddha's appearance or the preaching of the *Lotus Sutra*.
[^5]: **Correct vs. Secondary:** Zhiyi uses the logic of "Principal vs. Ancillary" (*zhèng* / *báng*). While a section might be named "Parable," it contains doctrinal propositions (Dharma) and history (Conditions). The name is derived from the *dominant* pedagogical method used.
[^6]: **Treatise on the Lotus Sutra (Fǎhuá Lùn):** Vasubandhu’s *Upadeśa* on the Lotus Sutra (T.1519), translated by Bodhiruci and Tanlin. It provides the definitive category of the "Four Types of Śrāvakas."
[^7]: **Distinct Confusion (Bié Huò):** Specifically refers to the **Ignorance** (*wúmíng*) that obstructs the Middle Way, distinct from the View/Affliction confusion common to the Three Vehicles.
[^8]: **Eight Phases Prediction (Bā Xiàng Jì):** Predicting the full career of a Buddha, from descent from Tuṣita Heaven to Parinirvāṇa. The Two Vehicles were previously thought incapable of this.
[^9]: **Ground of Commonality (Bó Dì):** The stage of ordinary beings (*pṛthagjana*) who have not yet entered the Holy Stream (Srotāpanna). "Bó" means thin/slight (or sometimes spread out/common); here referring to the common state of mortals.
[^10]: **CBETA Sigla:** Bracketed markers such as `[＊4-3]`, `[＊4-4]`, or inline `[1]` are CBETA apparatus/location markers kept for line-traceability. They are not missing text or additional footnotes; translation coverage is complete.
