### 2. The Seven and a Half Chapters (Lines 18-21)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
○從「爾時世尊告舍利弗，汝已殷懃三請，豈得不說」下，廣明開三顯一，凡七品半，文為三：
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
From [the line] "At that time the World-Honored One told Śāriputra, 'You have already earnestly requested three times, how could I not speak?'" onwards, the text extensively clarifies the **Opening of the Three** (*kāi sān*) and **Revealing of the One** (*xiǎn yī*). In total, [this covers] seven and a half chapters.<br>
The text is [divided into] three [sections]:

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
一、為上根人法說；二、為中根人譬說；三、為下根人宿世因緣說，亦名理事行，例如《大品》亦為三根(云云)。

<div class="english-translation">
1.  **Dharma-Statement** (*fǎ shuō*) for people of the **Superior Root** (*shàng gēn*).<br>
2.  **Parable-Statement** (*pì shuō*) for people of the **Intermediate Root** (*zhōng gēn*).<br>
3.  **Past Causes and Conditions Statement** (*sùshì yīnyuán shuō*) for people of the **Inferior Root** (*xià gēn*).<br>
This is also named [the Division of] Principle (*lǐ*), Affairs (*shì*), and Practice (*xíng*). It is like the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra* (*Dà Pǐn*) which is also [divided] for the three roots (etc.).

## II. THE TEN MEANINGS (DIAGNOSTIC FRAMEWORK) (Lines 18-92; CBETA 004:18–92)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
今以十義料[4]揀：一、有通有別，二、有聲聞、無聲聞，三、惑有厚薄，四、根轉不轉，五、根有悟不悟，六、領解無領解，七、得記不得記，八、悟有淺深，九、益有權實，十、待時不待時。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Now, using **Ten Meanings** (*shí yì*), we analyze and distinguish [the nature of these Three Statements]:<br>
1.  Concerning General (*tōng*) and Distinct (*bié*).<br>
2.  Concerning the Presence of Voice-Hearers (*yǒu shēngwén*) or Absence of Voice-Hearers (*wú shēngwén*).<br>
3.  Confusion (*huò*) is Thick or Thin.<br>
4.  Roots Turn (*zhuǎn*) or Do Not Turn.<br>
5.  Roots have Awakening (*wù*) or Do Not Have Awakening.<br>

### Meanings 1: General and Distinct (Lines 22-23; CBETA 004:22–23)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
一、明通別者，初周別名法說，通則具三；
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**1. Clarifying the General and Distinct:**<br>
In the **First Week** (Dharma-Statement), the **Distinct Name** (*bié míng*) is "Dharma-Statement." However, the **General** (*tōng*) [nature] possesses all three [modes].
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「如優曇花時一現耳」，即譬說；「若我遇眾生，盡教以佛道」，即因緣說也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
[For example, the line] "Like the *Uḍumbara* flower which appears once in a [long] time" is the **Parable Statement**.<br>
[The line] "If I encounter sentient beings, I teach them all the Buddha Path" is the **Causes and Conditions Statement**.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
中周別名譬說，通則亦三，「我先不言，皆為化菩薩故」。又合譬於一佛乘分別說三，即是法說；
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
In the **Middle Week** (Parable Statement), the **Distinct Name** is "Parable Statement," but the General [nature] also possesses three.<br>
[The line] "I did not speak before, because it was all for converting Bodhisattvas" is the **Causes and Conditions Statement**.<br>
Furthermore, combining the parable [with the meaning] "Within the One Buddha Vehicle, distinguishing and speaking of three," this is the **Dharma-Statement**.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「於二萬億佛所常教化汝」，即因緣說。若謂此文屬法說者，可取長者聞已驚入火宅方宜救濟，即因緣說。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
[The line] "In the place of two-myriad *koṭis* of Buddhas, I constantly taught and converted you," is the **Causes and Conditions Statement**.<br>
If one says this text belongs to the Dharma-Statement, one can take "The Elder heard this and was alarmed, entering the Burning House to expediently save them"—this is the **Causes and Conditions Statement**.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
下周別名宿世因緣，通亦具三，「涅槃時到眾又清淨令入佛慧」，是法說；「有一導師」是譬說，而作三周者，從多從正，從略從傍，欲令名字不濫，各據一意耳。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
In the **Lower Week**, the **Distinct Name** is "Past Causes and Conditions." The General also possesses three.<br>
[The line] "The time for Nirvana has arrived, the assembly is pure again... leading them to enter Buddha Wisdom," is the **Dharma-Statement**.<br>
[The line] "There is a Guide..." is the **Parable Statement**.<br>
Thus, creating [the distinction of] "Three Weeks" follows the **Majority** (*duō*) or the **Correct** (*zhèng*) [aspect], or follows the **Abbreviated** (*lüè*) or the **Secondary** (*báng*). Desiring that the names not be confused, each relies on one [dominant] meaning only.
</div>
</div>

---

### DIALECTICAL Q&A (Lines 24-30; CBETA 004:24–30)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
問：三周為三根人，一周通有三說者，一說應具三根？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Question:** The Three Weeks are for the people of the Three Roots. If one Week generally possesses [all] three Statements, should one Statement possess [all] Three Roots?
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
答：法說非止逗上中之上，又有中下，從正略傍，故言逗上根人耳，餘二周亦如是。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Answer:** The Dharma-Statement targets not only the Superior (*shàng*) [Root], or the Superior of the Intermediate (*zhōngzhīshàng*); it also possesses [capacity for] the Intermediate and Inferior.<br>
Following the **Correct** [focus] and abbreviating the **Secondary**, generally we say it "targets the people of the Superior Root." The remaining two Weeks are also like this.
</div>
</div>

### Meanings 2: Presence or Absence of Voice-Hearers (Lines 32-36; CBETA 004:32–36)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
[1]二、明有聲聞、無聲聞者，光宅定有實行聲聞，若言無實，權何所應。開善解無實行聲聞，引《勝鬘》「三乘初業不愚於法」，外凡已知一乘，寧有二乘猶執小果？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**2. Clarifying the Presence or Absence of Voice-Hearers:**<br>
**Guangzhai** determines there *are* "Real Practice Voice-Hearers" (*shíxíng shēngwén*). [He argues:] If one says there are no Real [Voice-Hearers], to whom does the Provisional [Teaching] respond?<br>
**Kaishan** explains there are *no* Real Practice Voice-Hearers. He cites the *Śrīmālādevī Sūtra*: "Those beginning the practice of the Three Vehicles are not ignorant of the Dharma." [He argues:] If ordinary beings (*wài fán*) already know the One Vehicle, how could there be Two Vehicles who still grasp the Small Fruit?
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
經明有者權也，此二家偏執，乖經失義；若定有者，經那言無聲聞弟子但化諸菩薩？若定無者，誰入化城？亦無三可會，權何所引？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
The **Sutra** clarifies that "Existence" [of Voice-Hearers] is Provisional. These two schools [Guangzhai and Kaishan] hold **Partial Attachments** (*piān zhí*), violating the Sutra and losing the meaning.<br>
If there are definitely [Real Voice-Hearers], how can the Sutra say "There are no Voice-Hearer disciples, I only convert Bodhisattvas"?<br>
If there are definitely *no* [Real Voice-Hearers], who enters the Magic City? There would also be no "Three" to "Converge" (*huì*). What would the Provisional be leading?
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
《法華論》有四種聲聞：一、決定；二、上慢；三、退大；四、應化。前二未熟不與授記，後二與記。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
The ***Treatise on the Lotus Sutra*** (*Fǎhuá Lùn*)[^6] lists four kinds of Voice-Hearers:<br>
1.  **Determinate** (*juédìng*).<br>
2.  **Overweening** (*shàng màn*).<br>
3.  **Retreating from Great** (*tuì dà*).<br>
4.  **Transformation/Response** (*yìng huà*).<br>
The first two are not yet mature and are not given the Prediction (*shòu jì*). The latter two are given the Prediction.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
若依今經應有五：一、久習小，今世道熟，聞小教證果，如《論》是決定聲聞；
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
If we rely on **this Sutra** [the *Lotus*], there should be **Five**:<br>
1.  Those who have long practiced the Small, and in this life their Way is mature; hearing the Small Teaching they certify the Fruit. This corresponds to the *Treatise*’s "Determinate Voice-Hearer."
</div>
</div>

### Meanings 3: Confusion is Thick or Thin (Lines 36-39; CBETA 004:36–39)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
第三、惑有厚薄者，... 今明根有利鈍者，皆論大乘根性，惑有厚薄者，約別惑為言耳，即為四句：
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**3. Clarifying if Confusion (*huò*) is Thick or Thin:**<br>
[...] Now, when clarifying if Roots are Sharp or Dull, we discuss only the **Mahāyāna Root Nature**. When discussing if Confusion is Thick or Thin, we speak regarding the **Distinct Confusion** (*bié huò*)[^7]. This forms Four Phrases:
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
一、惑輕根利；二、惑重根利；三、惑輕根鈍；四、惑重根鈍。若別惑輕、大根利，初聞即悟；...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
1.  **Confusion Light, Root Sharp** (*huò qīng gēn lì*): Upon first hearing, they awaken immediately (e.g. Upper Root in Dharma Week).<br>
2.  **Confusion Heavy, Root Sharp**.<br>
3.  **Confusion Light, Root Dull**.<br>
4.  **Confusion Heavy, Root Dull**: Though hearing three times, they do not awaken; they are merely an assembly for forming Karmic Ties (*jié yuán*).
</div>
</div>

---

### Meanings 4: Turning Roots or Not Turning (Lines 40-49; CBETA 004:40–49)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
四、明轉根不轉根者，... 譬三刀斫木，利一、中二、鈍者三下，利鈍之名不失，木斷之處是同。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**4. Clarifying Turning Roots or Not Turning Roots:**<br>
[...] For example, **Three Knives Chopping Wood**:<br>
The **Sharp** one [cuts in] one blow.<br>
The **Intermediate** one [cuts in] two blows.<br>
The **Dull** one [cuts in] three blows.<br>
The names "Sharp" and "Dull" are not lost, but the place where the wood is severed is the same [Identity/Result].
</div>
</div>

---

### Meanings 5: Roots have Awakening or Do Not Have Awakening (Lines 58-69; CBETA 004:58–69)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
五、明有悟不悟者，經中多明菩薩為上根、緣覺中根、聲聞下根，若言菩薩上根，應併在法說中得悟，緣覺併在譬說中得解，聲聞併在於因緣中得悟耶？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**5. Clarifying if Roots Have Awakening or Do Not Have Awakening:**<br>
Sutras often clarify that **Bodhisattvas** are the Superior Root, **Pratyekabuddhas** are the Intermediate Root, and **Voice-Hearers** are the Inferior Root.<br>
If we say Bodhisattvas are the Superior Root, should they all awaken in the **Dharma-Statement**?<br>
Should Pratyekabuddhas all understand in the **Parable-Statement**?<br>
Should Voice-Hearers all awaken in the **Causes and Conditions Statement**?
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
然經中一往判出三根，至於悟解義未必然。今經但見聲聞得解、不見支佛者，支佛是中根，既值佛出世入聲聞數，隨根得悟故，不別標緣覺耳。故身子請偈云：「其求緣覺者，比丘、比丘尼。」依此文即知緣覺入四眾中攝也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
However, while the Sutras generally categorize the Three Roots this way, regarding the meaning of "Awakening and Understanding," it is not necessarily so.<br>
In **this Sutra** [the *Lotus*], we see only Voice-Hearers understanding, but **do not see Pratyekabuddhas** [mentioned separately]. Why?<br>
Pratyekabuddhas are the Intermediate Root. Since they encounter a Buddha appearing in the world, they enter into the number of the Voice-Hearers (*shēngwén shù*). They awaken according to their roots, so the text does not separately mark "Pratyekabuddhas" [as a distinct group].<br>
Therefore, in Śāriputra’s request verse, it says: "**Those seeking the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle, Bhikṣus and Bhikṣuṇīs**..." Relying on this text, we know that Pratyekabuddhas are gathered within the Four Assemblies.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
... 舊云：「菩薩是上根，不必皆利...」今明菩薩語通，但使發大心悉是菩薩，何必併是利根？... 故知菩薩得悟，不可局在初周之初也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
[...] **Old Interpretations** say: "Bodhisattvas are the Superior Root, but not all are necessarily sharp..."<br>
**Current Clarification:** The term "Bodhisattva" is general (*tōng*). Anyone who generates the **Great Mind** (*dà xīn*) is entirely a Bodhisattva; why must they all be Sharp Roots?<br>
[...] Therefore we know that Bodhisattvas' awakening cannot be restricted to the beginning of the First Week.
</div>
</div>

---

### Meanings 6: Receiving Understanding or Not Receiving (Lines 71-73; CBETA 004:71–73)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
六、明有領解無領解者，若三乘同悟，何意但見聲聞領解，其二則無？... 身子、迦葉等，悉是中乘根性，故聲聞領解兼得緣覺，無勞別出也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**6. Clarifying Receiving Understanding (*lǐng jiě*) or Not Receiving Understanding:**<br>
If the Three Vehicles all awaken together, why do we only see the Voice-Hearers receiving understanding, but the other two do not?<br>
[...] Śāriputra, Kāśyapa, and others possess the **Intermediate Vehicle Root Nature**. Therefore, when the Voice-Hearers receive understanding, it simultaneously includes the Pratyekabuddhas; there is no labor in separately listing them.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
菩薩不領解者，... 又其意有三：一、菩薩本意求佛... 二、菩薩悟大，處處有文... 三、菩薩位行深絕，諸新小菩薩不敢領解...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Regarding why **Bodhisattvas do not Receive Understanding**:<br>
[...] There are three meanings:<br>
1.  **Original Intent:** Bodhisattvas originally seek Buddhahood. Even if they had different attachments, they are light; ultimately they return to grasping Buddhahood.<br>
2.  **Ubiquity:** Bodhisattvas awakening to the Great [Vehicle] is found everywhere in the text.<br>
3.  **Depth:** The Bodhisattva position and practice are deeply transcendent. The new, small Bodhisattvas dare not [presume to] receive understanding.
</div>
</div>

---

### Meanings 7: Obtaining Prediction or Not Obtaining (Lines 75-84; CBETA 004:75–84)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
七、得記不得記者，若同皆領解，何故聲聞得記，不見緣覺、菩薩受記？此亦三意：一者、昔明二乘入正位不能發心，何由得記？今既悟大，欣斯別決，故為記劫國也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**7. Clarifying Obtaining Prediction (*dé jì*) or Not Obtaining:**<br>
If all equally receive understanding, why do Voice-Hearers receive the Prediction (*vyākaraṇa*), but we do not see Pratyekabuddhas or Bodhisattvas receiving it?<br>
This also has **three meanings**:<br>
1.  **The Surprise Factor:** Formerly, it was explained that Two Vehicles entering the **Correct Position** (*zhèng wèi*) could not generate the [Bodhi] Mind. How could they receive a prediction? Now that they have awakened to the Great, they rejoice in this special decision (*bié jué*). Therefore, the Buddha predicts their **Kalpas and Lands** (*jié guó*).
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
菩薩發心求佛行成自滿，故不欣急求佛亦不促授... 二、菩薩亦有別記，調達、龍女豈非記耶？... 三、二乘昔來未曾得八相記，故記其劫國；菩薩先已曾記，故不重明耳。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Bodhisattvas generate the mind to seek Buddhahood and their practice naturally fulfills itself. Thus, they are not anxious to seek it, nor does the Buddha hurriedly confer it.<br>
2.  **Also Predicted:** Bodhisattvas *do* have special predictions. Are not **Devadatta** and the **Dragon Girl** predictions?<br>
3.  **Novelty:** The Two Vehicles have never before received the **Eight Phases Prediction** (*bā xiàng jì*)[^8], so the Buddha predicts their Kalpas and Lands. Bodhisattvas have already been predicted before, so it is not restated.
</div>
</div>

---

### Meanings 8: Awakening is Shallow or Deep (Line 85; CBETA 004:85)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
八、明悟有淺深者，一往同破無明入證初住，細尋必應明晦。初聞法說尚入佛慧，更聞譬說豈不重明？又聞因緣，理自增進...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**8. Clarifying if Awakening is Shallow or Deep:**<br>
Generally speaking, all [Three Groups] equally break Ignorance and enter the **First Abode** (*chū zhù*). However, if we examine closely, there must be brightness and obscurity.<br>
If one enters Buddha Wisdom upon first hearing the Dharma-Statement, and then *further* hears the Parable-Statement, how could it not be doubly clear?<br>
Hearing the Causes and Conditions [Statement], the principle naturally increases and advances... like a listener hearing the Dharma again, it exceeds the previous [understanding].
</div>
</div>

---

### Meanings 9: Benefit has Provisional and Real (Line 87a; CBETA 004:87a)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
[3]九、明權實得益不同者，一云實行得益，權行[4]正為接引影響不論其益。今明不爾，若至〈壽量〉權實悉得益，增道彌高、損生彌盡，隣圓際極，唯一生在，豈非權者益耶？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**9. Clarifying if Benefit (*yì*) has Provisional (*quán*) and Real (*shí*) Differences:**<br>
One [view] says that the **Real Practice** [Bodhisattvas] obtain benefit, while the **Provisional Practice** [Bodhisattvas] are only for leading and influencing (*yǐngxiǎng*), and we do not discuss their benefit.<br>
**Current Clarification:** It is not so. If we reach the *Life-span* chapter, both Provisional and Real [Bodhisattvas] entirely obtain benefit. Their **Way increases** ever higher, and their **Births decrease** ever more completely. Approaching the Perfect [Result] and bordering the Ultimate, with only one life remaining—is this not the benefit of the Provisional ones?
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
所以初為影響共熟實行，後說極果則自道明，文云：「出入息利乃遍他國」，息利在他即是己利，實行得益由於權引，化功歸己權亦得益，故一音演說法，眾生隨類各得解，何必須待〈壽量〉耶(云云)？又我自欲得此真淨大法即是自益也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Therefore, initially they [Provisional Bodhisattvas] act as Influencers to help mature the Real Practice; later, when the Ultimate Fruit is spoken, their own Way becomes clear.<br>
The text says: "**Interests** (*xī lì*) [of the trade] spread even to other lands." The interest spreading to others is precisely one's own benefit. The Real Practice obtaining benefit is due to the Provisional's leading. The merit of conversion returns to oneself, so the Provisional also obtains benefit.<br>
Thus, "With one voice He preaches the Dharma, and sentient beings each obtain understanding according to their kind." Why must we wait for the *Life-span* chapter (etc.)? <br>
Furthermore, [the line] "I myself desire to obtain this Great Dharma of True Purity" is precisely **Self-Benefit**.
</div>
</div>

### Meanings 10: Waiting for Time vs. Not Waiting (Line 87b; CBETA 004:87b)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
十、明待時不待時，爾前不悟必待《法華》悟者，名為待時；《法華》前教已解者，名不待時。何故爾？佛有顯密二說...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**10. Clarifying Waiting for Time (*dài shí*) or Not Waiting for Time:**<br>
Those who did not awaken **Previously** (*ěr qián*) and must wait for the *Lotus Sutra* to awaken are named "**Waiting for Time**."<br>
Those who already understood in the teachings **Before the *Lotus*** are named "**Not Waiting for Time**."<br>
Why is this? The Buddha has **Two Expositions**: **Explicit** (*xiǎn*) and **Secret** (*mì*).
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
若顯說為論，《法華》之前二乘未悟大道，要須五味調熟會在法華，故云：「說時未至故，今正是其時，決定說大乘。」此即待時也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
If we discuss the **Explicit Exposition**: Before the *Lotus*, the Two Vehicles did not awaken to the Great Way. They required the **Five Flavors** to tune and mature them, converging (*huì*) only in the *Lotus*.<br>
Therefore it says: "Because the Time for speaking had not yet arrived... Now is exactly the Time; I decisively speak the Great Vehicle." This is **Waiting for Time**.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
若密教為論，未必具待五味在法華方會，爾前密有入者故名不待時，此乃大判時不時... 迹本二門，亦是待時、不待時，致有前後悟入，即此意也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
If we discuss the **Secret Teaching**: They need not necessarily wait for the Five Flavors to converge only in the *Lotus*. Previously, there were those who secretly entered [the Great Vehicle], thus named **Not Waiting for Time**.<br>
This broadly judges Time and Not Time. Regarding the **Three Weeks**, there is also Waiting for Time and Not Waiting for Time. Regarding the **Two Gates of Trace and Origin** (*jī běn èr mén*), there is also Waiting for Time and Not Waiting for Time. This leads to awakening and entering occurring before and after—this is the meaning.
</div>

### Q&A: Lost Time (Lines 92-106; CBETA 004:92–106)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
問：有一種根性非密、非顯二時不攝者，應是失時永不得悟耶？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Question:** There is a type of root nature that is not gathered by either the Secret or Explicit times. Would this be **Lost Time** (*shī shí*), never obtaining awakening?
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
答：餘經或謂此為失時，今經不爾。此人雖於密、顯兩時不悟，雖生滅度之想，而於彼土得聞是經，故無失時，乃是待彼土之時耳。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Answer:** Other Sutras might call this "Lost Time," but **This Sutra** [the *Lotus*] does not. Although this person does not awaken during the Secret or Explicit times [of this life], and although they produce the thought of [entering] Extinction (Nirvana), they will obtain hearing of this Sutra in **That Land** [where they are reborn].<br>
Therefore, there is **No Lost Time**. It is merely **Waiting for the Time of That Land**.

### Q&A on Three Roots Sequence (Lines 110-114; CBETA 004:110–114)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
問：身子初周為四眾三根請，譬周為中下請，云何言佛各為三根人三周說法耶？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Question:** In the First Week, Śāriputra requested on behalf of the Three Roots of the Four Assemblies. In the Parable Week, he requested for the Intermediate and Inferior [Roots].<br>
Why then do we say the Buddha speaks Dharma in Three Weeks, each for the people of the Three Roots? If the request was specific, why is the response general?
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
答：此語不便，請則普請、說亦普說，但上根智利聞法得悟，中根處中聞譬得悟，下根居下聞三得悟，汝當隨義云何隨語(云云)？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Answer:** This phrasing [of the question] is inconvenient (awkward).<br>
Regarding **Requesting**, he requests universally (*pǔ qǐng*).<br>
Regarding **Speaking**, the Buddha also speaks universally (*pǔ shuō*).<br>
However:<br>
The **Superior Root** (*shàng gēn*), being wise and sharp, hears the Dharma [Statement] and obtains awakening.<br>
The **Intermediate Root** (*zhōng gēn*), occupying the middle, hears the Parable and obtains awakening.<br>
The **Inferior Root** (*xià gēn*), dwelling below, hears [all] Three and obtains awakening.<br>
You should follow the **Meaning** (*suí yì*); why follow the mere words (*suí yǔ*)?
</div>
</div>

### Q&A on Past, Present, Future (Lines 118-122; CBETA 004:118–122)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
問：宿世是過去事法，譬是當、現事不？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Question:** "**Past Lives**" (*sùshì*) refers to the affairs and dharmas of the Past (*guòqù*). Is the "**Parable**" (*pì*) referring to affairs of the Future (*dāng*) and Present (*xiàn*)?
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
答：經無文，義推應爾。引三歸一，三望一，一則是當；舉事為譬，譬即是現。準後望前，應如所問。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Answer:** The Sutra has no [explicit] text, but by inferring the meaning, it should be so.<br>
Guiding the Three to return to the One: The Three look toward the One; the One is the **Future**.<br>
Raising affairs to make a Parable: The Parable is the **Present**.<br>
Measuring the Back (Future) and looking at the Front (Past), it should be as you asked. [Thus: Past = Causes/Conditions, Present = Parable, Future = Dharma/One Vehicle Result].
</div>
</div>

### Q&A on Obstacles (Lines 126-132; CBETA 004:126–132)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
問：舊以五濁障大... 若博地不執涅槃而不聞法者，即是無明獨為障... 是義云何？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Question:** Old interpretations take the **Five Corruptions** (*wǔ zhuó*) as obstructing the Great [Vehicle]. [...]<br>
If a person on the **Ground of Commonality** (*bó dì*)[^9] does not grasp Nirvana and does not hear the Dharma, then **Ignorance** (*wúmíng*) alone constitutes the obstacle.<br>
If this is so, is Ignorance broken *after* hearing the Dharma in the Three Weeks? Or is Ignorance broken *before* hearing the Dharma?<br>
If broken after hearing, then Ignorance was not the [preventative] obstacle [to hearing].<br>
If broken before hearing, then we worry there was no obstacle at all.<br>
What is the meaning of this?
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
答：是他人立義，今為其通。譬如燈生闇滅，不可定其前後，雖不前後，闇定是障(云云)。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Answer:** This is a meaning established by others, but I will make it pass (harmonize it) for them.<br>
It is like a **Lamp** arising and the **Darkness** perishing. One cannot determine [a gap regarding] their "Before and After" (they are simultaneous).<br>
Although not Before or After, the Darkness is definitely the obstacle [to the Light]. (etc.)
</div>

### III. THE FIVE THOUSAND LEAVE (Lines 155-161)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「說[4]是語時」，是[＊4-3]揀眾許，五千在座故如來三止，今將許說，威神遣去，故名[＊4-4]揀眾。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
[The line] "When He spoke these words" refers to the **Selection/filtering of the Assembly for Permission** (*jiǎn zhòng xǔ*).<br>
Because the **Five Thousand** were in the seat, the Tathāgata stopped three times (*sān zhǐ*). Now that He is about to permit the speaking, His Awesome Spirit sends them away (*qiǎn qù*). Therefore it is named "filtering the assembly."[^10]
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
五濁障多名罪重，執小翳大名根深，未得謂得名上慢，未得三果未證無學。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
The **Five Corruptions** are heavy obstacles, hence named **Heavy Sin** (*zuì zhòng*).<br>
Grasping the Small to obscure the Great is named **Deep Roots** [of delusion].<br>
Claiming to have obtained what one has not obtained is named **Overweening Pride** (*shàng màn*). They had not obtained the Three Fruits and had not certified to No-Learning (*wú xué*).
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「有如此失」者，謂障、執、慢三種之失也。「而不制止」者，上聞開三顯一，言略義隱猶未生謗，足作繫珠因緣，去則有益；若聞廣開三顯一，乖情起謗，住則有損，是故不制止也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
[The line] "They had such faults as these" refers to the three kinds of faults: **Obstacles** (*zhàng*), **Grasping** (*zhí*), and **Pride** (*màn*).<br>
[The line] "He did not restrict or stop them [from leaving]":<br>
Previously, they heard the [brief] Opening of the Three and Revealing of the One. The words were abbreviated and the meaning hidden, so they had not yet generated slander. This was sufficient to create the **Causes and Conditions of the Tied Jewel** (*xì zhū yīnyuán*). Leaving brings benefit.<br>
If they heard the **Extensive** Opening of Three and Revealing of One, it would violate their feelings (*guāi qíng*) and generate slander. Staying would bring harm.<br>
Therefore, He did not stop them.
</div>
</div>

### Q&A: Benefit of Leaving? (Lines 173-179; CBETA 004:173–179)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
問：五千在座即不蒙益，去有何益？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Question:** If the Five Thousand, while in the seat, did not receive benefit, what benefit is there in their leaving?
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
答：此非當機，是結緣人耳，已如上說。昔大通佛時，亦有無量眾生心生疑惑，世世與師俱生，今皆得度，此人亦爾... 《金光明》中，時閻浮提有二種人，亦是斯例意。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Answer:** These are not [people of the present] **Capacity** (*dāng jī*); they are merely people for **Forming Karmic Ties** (*jié yuán rén*), as explained above.<br>
Formerly, in the time of the Buddha **Great Universal Wisdom Excellence** (*Daītóng*), there were also immeasurable sentient beings whose minds produced doubt. Yet life after life they were born together with the Master [Śākyamuni], and now they are all saved.<br>
These people [the 5,000] are also like this. When the *Mahāyāna Parinirvāṇa Sūtra* (*Dà Jīng*) was spoken, 15,000 *koṭis* of people did not generate faith in that Sutra; yet these people will also obtain faith in the future. The benefit lies in the near future.<br>
In the *Suvarṇaprabhāsa Sūtra* (*Golden Light*), it says in Jambudvīpa there were two kinds of people... this is also the meaning of this example.

## III. SPECIFIC EXPLANATION OF THE OPENING (Lines 183-187; CBETA 004:183–187)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
從「如是妙法」下，是正廣說，文為二：一、明四佛章，廣上諸佛權實；二、明釋迦章，廣上釋迦權實。上句逗少，是文略；總云諸佛，是人略；但開三顯一，是義略。此中章句多，是文廣...

<div class="english-translation">
From the line "Such a Wonderful Dharma as this..." onwards is the **Correct Extensive Explanation**.<br>
The text is divided into two:<br>
1.  **Chapter on the Four Buddhas**: Although it extensively clarifies the Provisional and Real of All Buddhas [Generally].<br>
2.  **Chapter on Śākyamuni**: Extensively clarifying the Provisional and Real of Śākyamuni [Specifically].<br>
Previously, the sentences were few (Abbreviated Text); it generally spoke of "All Buddhas" (Abbreviated Person); and it only Opened the Three to Reveal the One (Abbreviated Meaning).<br>
Here, the chapters and sentences are many (**Extensive Text**); it clarifies Five Buddhas (**Extensive Person**); and it clarifies Six Aspects (**Extensive Meaning**).

<div class="english-translation">
**The Six Aspects are:**<br>
1.  Praising the Dharma as Rare.<br>
2.  Speaking No Falsehoods.<br>
3.  Opening Expedients.<br>

5.  Raising the Five Corruptions to explain the Provisional.<br>
6.  Rejecting the False to Establish the Real.<br>
In [each of] the Five Chapters [of the Buddhas], each one should possess these Six Meanings.

### Detailed Explanation of the Four Ones (Lines 201-212)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
今且從略說，以四一消文，先釋理一，復為四意：一、約四位，二、約四智，三、約四門，四、約觀心。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Now, speaking briefly, we use the **Four Ones** to dissolve (interpret) the text.<br>
First, explaining **One Principle** (*Lǐ Yī*), we further use four meanings:<br>
1.  According to the Four Positions.<br>
2.  According to the Four Wisdoms.<br>
3.  According to the Four Gates.<br>
4.  According to Contemplating Mind.
</div>
</div>

#### 1. According to the Four Positions (*Yuē Sì Wèi*)
*   **Opening (*Kāi*):** Corresponds to the **Ten Inital Dwellings** (*Shí Zhù*). Breaking Ignorance, opening the Tathāgatagarbha, seeing the Principle of Real Mark. Like the sun rising and darkness perishing.
*   **Indicating (*Shì*):** Corresponds to the **Ten Lines** (*Shí Xíng*). Obstacles removed, the Substance of Knowledge and Vision is displayed. "Substance equipped with Myriad Virtues."
*   **Awakening (*Wù*):** Corresponds to the **Ten Dedications** (*Shí Huíxiàng*). Matters and Principle are fused; no dual destination.
*   **Entering (*Rù*):** Corresponds to the **Ten Grounds** (*Shí Dì*). Freedom/Sovereignty without obstruction. Flowing from "A" to "Cha" (Alpha to Omega) entering the Sea of Sarvājñā.

#### 2. According to the Four Wisdoms (*Yuē Sì Zhì*)
*   **Opening:** **Path Wisdom** (*Màrga-jñāna* / *Dào Huì*) - Seeing the real nature of the Path.
*   **Indicating:** **Path-Seed Wisdom** (*Dao-zhong-jñāna* / *Dào-zhǒng Huì*) - Knowing the discriminative aspects of the Ten Dharma Realms.
*   **Awakening:** **All-Knowledge** (*Sarvajñāna* / *Yīqiè Zhì*) - Knowing all dharmas are One Mark of Quiescence.
*   **Entering:** **Universal Knowledge** (*Sarvākārajñāna* / *Yīqiè Zhǒng Zhì*) - Rational and Functioning aspects doubly illuminated.

#### 3. According to the Four Gates (*Yuē Sì Mén*)
*   **Empty Gate:** One Emptiness, Everything Empty = Opening.
*   **Existential Gate:** One Existence, Everything Existing = Indicating.
*   **Both Empty and Existing Gate:** = Awakening.
*   **Neither Empty Nor Existing Gate:** = Entering.

#### 4. According to Contemplating Mind (*Yuē Guānxīn*)
*   Contemplating the Principle of the Three Truths of Mind-Nature as Inconceivable.
*   **Opening:** The contemplation is bright and pure.
*   **Indicating:** Distinguishing Empty, Provisional, Middle without confusion.
*   **Awakening:** The Three are One; the One is Three.
*   **Entering:** Neither Three nor One, yet illuminating Three and One simultaneously.

### Clarifying Teaching One and Action One (Lines 212-219)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
從「告舍利弗，如來但教化菩薩」... 即是人一也。從「諸有所作常為一事」... 今言行一... 從「但以一佛乘」者... 今言教一。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
From [the textual line] "Tell Śāriputra, the Tathāgata only teaches and transforms Bodhisattvas..." this is **One Person** (*Rén Yī*).<br>
From "All that is done is always for One Affair..." this is **One Action** (*Xíng Yī*).<br>
From "Only using the One Buddha Vehicle..." this is **One Teaching** (*Jiào Yī*).<br>
The Round and Sudden Teaching is named the "One Buddha Vehicle."
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
有人言... 若作此解，[＊1-3]秖是無三藏諸乘、存於通乘，何關一佛乘耶？... 都是妄說。今言「但以一佛乘」者，純說佛法之圓教乘也。「無餘乘」者，無別教帶方便有餘之說。「無二」者，無《般若》中之帶二。「無三」者，無方等中所對之三也。如此二三皆無，況三藏中三耶？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Some say [interpretations of "No Two vehicles, No Three vehicles"]...<br>
**Critique:** If interpreted that way, it is merely negating the Tripiṭaka vehicles and keeping the Shared Teaching vehicles; what does this have to do with the One Buddha Vehicle? These are all false explanations.<br>
**Current Explanation:** "Only using One Buddha Vehicle" means **Purely Speaking the Round Teaching Vehicle of the Buddha-Dharma.**<br>
"No other vehicles" means no "Distinct Teaching" with its Expedient/With-Remainder sayings.<br>
"No Two" means no "With-Two" (Bodhisattva + Śrāvaka) found in *Prajñā*.<br>
"No Three" means no "Facing Three" found in *Vaipulya*.<br>
If these Two and Three are absent, how much more so the Three [Vehicles] of the Tripiṭaka?

#### FOOTNOTES

[^1]: **Seven and a Half Chapters:** Refers to the *Lotus Sutra* text from the *Expedient Means* chapter (Chapter 2) through the *Prophecies Conferred on Learners and Adepts* (Chapter 9). This section constitutes the "Trace Gate" teaching of Opening the Three to Reveal the One.
[^2]: **Upper:** Fascicle 4 is typically divided into "Upper" and "Lower" parts in printed editions due to length.
[^3]: **Three Weeks (Sān Zhōu 三周):** Zhiyi's exegetical structure for the *Lotus Sutra*. (1) **Dharma Week** (*Fǎ shuō*): Direct teaching (Ch. 2). (2) **Parable Week** (*Pì shuō*): Teaching via story (Ch. 3-4). (3) **Causes and Conditions Week** (*Yīnyuán shuō*): Teaching via past lives (Ch. 7-9).
[^4]: **Uḍumbara Flower:** A mythical flower said to bloom only once every 3,000 years, symbolizing the rarity of a Buddha's appearance or the preaching of the *Lotus Sutra*.
[^5]: **Correct vs. Secondary:** Zhiyi uses the logic of "Principal vs. Ancillary" (*zhèng* / *báng*). While a section might be named "Parable," it contains doctrinal propositions (Dharma) and history (Conditions). The name is derived from the *dominant* pedagogical method used.
[^6]: **Treatise on the Lotus Sutra (Fǎhuá Lùn):** Vasubandhu’s *Upadeśa* on the Lotus Sutra (T.1519), translated by Bodhiruci and Tanlin. It provides the definitive category of the "Four Types of Śrāvakas."
[^7]: **Distinct Confusion (Bié Huò):** Specifically refers to the **Ignorance** (*wúmíng*) that obstructs the Middle Way, distinct from the View/Affliction confusion common to the Three Vehicles.
[^8]: **Eight Phases Prediction (Bā Xiàng Jì):** Predicting the full career of a Buddha, from descent from Tuṣita Heaven to Parinirvāṇa. The Two Vehicles were previously thought incapable of this.
[^9]: **Ground of Commonality (Bó Dì):** The stage of ordinary beings (*pṛthagjana*) who have not yet entered the Holy Stream (Srotāpanna). "Bó" means thin/slight (or sometimes spread out/common); here referring to the common state of mortals.
[^10]: **CBETA Sigla:** Bracketed markers such as `[＊4-3]`, `[＊4-4]`, or inline `[1]` are CBETA apparatus/location markers kept for line-traceability. They are not missing text or additional footnotes; translation coverage is complete.
