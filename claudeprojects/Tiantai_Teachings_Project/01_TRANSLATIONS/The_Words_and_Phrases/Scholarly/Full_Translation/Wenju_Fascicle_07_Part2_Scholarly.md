## X. EXPLANATION OF MAGIC CITY PARABLE CHAPTER (Lines 141-180; CBETA 007:141–180)

### 1. Title and Cause/Condition (Lines 141-150)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「化」者，神力所為也，以神力故無而欻有，名之為化。防非禦敵，稱之為「城」，內合二乘涅槃者，權智所為也。以權智力無而說有，用教為化防思禦見，名為涅槃；蘇息引入實未究竟，而言滅度。權假施設故言「化城」。喻如前說。此是因緣釋也。

約教者，若三藏義者，於涅槃生安隱想、生滅度想；若通教二乘與三藏同；菩薩不爾，《釋論》云，如父過險，一脚入城一脚門外，憶妻子故從城入險，誓願扶餘習入生死，而不以空為證也；別教不道城如化，用城防險，從城門徑過，將城作方便斷見思惑，不道此為極也；圓教知無賊[3]病亦不須城，故言化城也。今是圓教意，故題為「化城喻品」也。本迹、觀心不記。

問：此品說因緣事，下根得悟，應名宿世品。答：品初廣說因緣，末則結譬化城，若從前應稱宿世，經從末故言化城。又上根疑薄，但取道樹三七思惟，以明機緣；中根疑濃加以譬喻，探取二萬億佛所教無上道，以為機緣；下根疑復厚，則明宿世久遠機緣。若從宿世之始，明久遠因緣，語其中間言其化城，明其究竟言其寶所，經家處中標品，收得初後，從此義便，故言化城品。

問：化城是權、寶所是實，何意棄實從權？答：由知城是化，則知寶所是實，故標化不失實也。

**1. Definitions and Causal Explanation (*Yīn Yuán Shì*):**<br>
*   **"Transformation/Magic" (*Huà*):** This is created by **Spiritual Power** (*Shén Lì*). Because of spiritual power, "that which does not exist suddenly exists" (*wú ér xū yǒu*) is named "Transformation."<br>
*   **"City" (*Chéng*):** "Defending against wrong and resisting enemies" (*fáng fēi yù dí*) is called "City."<br>
*   **Internal Match:** This matches the **Nirvana of the Two Vehicles**, which is created by **Provisional Wisdom** (*Quán Zhì*).<br>
    *   Using the power of Provisional Wisdom, "that which does not exist is said to exist" (*wú ér shuō yǒu*).<br>
    *   Using the teaching to act as transformation (*yòng jiào wéi huà*), defending against [False] Thoughts and resisting [Wrong] Views (*fáng sī yù jiàn*), is named **Nirvana**.<br>
    *   Resting and breathing to lead into the Real, not yet being ultimate, yet it is traditionally called "Extinction" (*miè dù*).<br>
*   Because it is a **Provisional and Temporary Establishment** (*Quán Jiǎ Shī Shè*), it is called "Magic City." The parable is as explained before. This is the **Explanation by Cause and Conditions**.<br>

**2. Explanation by Restricting the Teaching (*Yuē Jiào Shì*):**<br>
*   **Tripitaka Teaching (*Sān Zàng*):** Regarding Nirvana, they produce thoughts of "Safety and Peace" (*Ān Yǐn*) and thoughts of "extinction."<br>
*   **Shared Teaching (*Tōng Jiào*):**<br>
    *   The Two Vehicles are the same as the Tripitaka.<br>
    *   The Bodhisattva is not like this. *The Treatise* says: "Like a father passing danger, one foot enters the city, one foot is outside the gate. Because he remembers his wife and children, from the city he enters danger [again], swearing a vow to support remaining habits to enter birth and death, and does not take Emptiness as realization."<br>
*   **Distinct Teaching (*Bié Jiào*):** Does not say the city is "like magic." Uses the city to defend against danger. Passing straight through the city gate, taking the city as a skillful means to sever View and Thought confusions, but does not say this is the ultimate.<br>
*   **Perfect Teaching (*Yuán Jiào*):** Knows there are no thieves/bandits, and the [3] sickness also does not require a city. Therefore, it is called "Magic City."<br>
*   **Conclusion:** Now, this is the intent of the **Perfect Teaching**. Therefore, the title is "Magic City Parable Chapter." (The Vital/Traces and Contemplating Mind are not recorded).<br>

**3. Question and Answer: Naming the Chapter:**<br>
*   **Question:** This chapter speaks of **Causes and Conditions events** (*Yīn Yuán Shì*). Lower Roots attain realization [through this]. It should be named "Past Lives Chapter" (*Sù Shì Pǐn*).<br>
*   **Answer:**<br>
    *   The beginning of the chapter extensively speaks of causes and conditions; the end concludes with the parable of the Magic City. If following the beginning, it should be called "Past Lives." The Sutra follows the end, thus it says "Magic City."<br>
    *   **Root Capacities:**<br>
        *   **Upper Roots:** Doubts are thin. Simply taking the "Three Sevens" (21 days) of contemplation at the Way Tree explains the mechanism (*jī yuán*).<br>
        *   **Middle Roots:** Doubts are thick. Added with parables, probing the instruction of the Unsurpassed Way at the place of the 20,000 million Buddhas to be the mechanism.<br>
        *   **Lower Roots:** Doubts are even thicker. Thus clarifying the **Past Lives' Prominent/Distant Mechanism** (*Sù Shì Jiǔ Yuǎn Jī Yuán*).<br>
    *   **Synthesis:** If following the beginning (Past Lives), it clarifies distant causes and conditions; speaking of the middle, it refers to the Magic City; clarifying the ultimate, it refers to the Treasure Trove. The Sutra compiler, situated in the middle, marks the chapter [title], gathering the beginning and end. From this meaning of convenience, thus it is called "Magic City Chapter."<br>

**4. Question and Answer: Provisional vs. Real:**<br>
*   **Question:** The Magic City is Provisional (*Quán*); the Treasure Trove is Real (*Shí*). Why abandon the Real and follow the Provisional [in the title]?<br>
*   **Answer:** Because knowing the City is Magic, one knows the Treasure Trove is Real. Therefore, **Marking the Magic does not lose the Real** (*Biāo Huà Bù Shī Shí Yě*).<br>

此段三品經文，例前應四，但領解、述成皆在授記段中。何者？若不領解，安得授記、述成，故兼得二意。又領解、述成、得記，或前後不定，領解或默念、發言不同，其文少，不足分品，但入他段中。此品正說因緣，後兩品授記。初又二：一、先明知見久遠，二、明宿世結緣。如來三達，遠明如見今日，所引往事決定不虛，然後說宿命也。此二各有長行、偈頌。初長行有三：一、出所見事，即是好成、大相、大通勝佛也；二、舉譬明久遠；三、結見昔如今(云云)。偈有七行，頌前三義，如文。「佛壽五百四十」下，正明結緣。又為兩：初、結緣由，二、正結緣。由中又兩：遠由、近由。遠[4]由又二：一、大通智勝佛成道，二、十方梵請法。成道為五：一、佛壽長遠。「其佛本坐」下，第二，成道前事。但諸佛道同、為緣事異，釋迦苦行六年，草生攢髀至肘不覺，諸天哭喚動地不聞，移坐得道；彌勒即出家日得道；彼佛十劫猶不現前，非根有利鈍、道有難易，緣宜奢促應示長短耳。三，「諸比丘大通過十小劫」下，明正成道。四，「其佛未出家」下，明成道後眷屬供養。五，「爾時十六王偈讚」下，明請轉法輪。第一文易解。第二成佛前事，有二：一、佛坐道場所經時節，二、諸天供養。「佛告諸」至「得三菩提時」下，第二，諸梵請。文為二：一、威光照動，二、十方梵請。初威光者，《過去因果經》云「薩婆悉達處胎時，三千國土朗然大光，日月所不照處大明，其中眾生各得相見」。初成道時亦如是，朝為色天、中為欲天、晡為鬼神說法，夜亦如是。觀解，「忽生眾生」者，心性本淨，陰入界覆[5]之則闇，若修觀慧本性理顯。又兩山是二諦，其[6]間是中道。日月光是二智，佛光是中道。無分別智光，照本有三諦洞明也。「爾時東方」下，第二，十方梵。文為二：先九方，後上方。九方為四：一東，二東南，三南，四總明六方。前三方梵，文各有七：一覩瑞，二驚駭，三相問決，四尋光見佛，五三業供養，六請法，七默許，皆如文。上方梵止有六，世尊即說故無默許。舊云東、東南請小，七方請大，上方請小大。若《釋論》明梵本請大，佛雖說小未遂所請，若說般若猶酬梵請耳。若依〈方便品〉文，梵王請大，然佛法道同不應偏請。但經論存略，諸師偏據耳。又如今佛自始至終，具轉五味法輪，一一皆酬梵請，彼亦應然。初十六子請轉滿教，如今佛說《華嚴》；東、東南二方請轉半教，如今佛說三藏；後七方請轉對半明滿，如今佛說方等；上方梵請帶半明滿，如今佛說《般若》，後十六子請廢半明滿，如今佛說《法華》醍醐教也。今古節目文義相應(云云)。「爾時大通[7]智受十方」下，結緣近由。由佛受請說法，故後得覆講正作結緣。文為二：一、先轉半字法輪，二、諸子請轉廢半明滿字法輪。初為三：一、受請，二、正轉，三、聞法得道。此中應說三乘，如序品文，而今不說者，正為下根論結緣開顯等，略不言六度耳。三轉者，謂示、勸、證(云云)。亦將三轉對示教利喜，示即示轉，教即勸轉，利喜即證轉也。亦對見諦思惟無學也，為聲聞三轉，為緣覺再轉，為菩薩一轉。何故爾？由根利鈍。此一往說耳。通方例皆三轉。何故三轉？諸佛語法，法至於三，為眾生有三根故，《大論》及《婆沙》悉作此說。問：初為五人，云何作三根耶？復有八萬諸天，何故無三根？為生三慧、三根、三道故。「十二行」者，一約四諦教，二約十六行。教十二者，即示勸證是也；行十二者，三轉皆生眼智明覺。又教十二為能轉，行十二為所轉。十二行是輪，十二教非輪，若作二輪義，眼智明覺者，約四十八法，開此四心成十六心，謂苦法忍為眼、苦法智為智，比忍為明、比智為覺，餘三諦亦爾，故成十六心，三根人各得十六心，故成四十八行也。十二諦是教法輪，十二行是行法輪，教輪則能轉唯是一權智，所轉則有十二教也。若行法輪能轉之教有十二，所轉之行亦十二。或通三人、或約一人，今就見諦道三人，利根聞示轉，即生眼智明覺，三人合舉故言十二行也。所不能轉者，沙門不聞尚不[1]能知，何況能轉？支佛雖悟，口不能說；婆羅門雖聞其名，不解其理；魔梵亦爾。夫轉者，轉此法度入他心，令彼得悟，破六十二見，乃名轉法輪；為無此義，魔梵等所不能轉也。有解大乘四諦，次轉二諦、次轉一諦、次轉無諦，皆是卷舒之意。小乘四諦以生滅為體，大乘以無生為體(云云)。「十二因緣」者，還是別相細觀四諦耳。約苦、集即有無明老死，約道、滅即有無明滅乃至老死滅也。又三人通觀十二緣，二乘生滅十二緣，為菩薩無生十二緣。無生十二緣，本不生、今不滅，相生則相、生傳傳滅(云云)。又三乘亦通論四諦，二乘有量四諦，為菩薩無量四諦。又六度亦通三人，《大品．發趣品》云「阿羅漢、支佛，因六波羅蜜至彼岸。」《攝大乘》云「凡夫、二乘皆有六度，但不同耳。」若爾應俱名波羅蜜，然二乘行到涅槃彼岸亦稱波羅蜜，但不能到佛道彼岸，比菩薩異耳。《阿毘曇》有六足，[2]六足即六度，《寶雲經》明三乘毘尼(云云)。第三，聞法得悟者，初少中多。「不受」者，不受四見，悟初果[3]也。「得解脫」者，脫子、果兩縛，得無學也。「深妙定」者，即俱解脫也(云云)。

<div class="english-translation">
**1. Structure of the Segment (*Sān Pǐn Jīng Wén*):**<br>
*   **The Three Chapters:** This segment includes three chapters (Magic City, 500 Disciples, Prophecy).<br>
*   **Comparison:** Following previous examples, there should be four parts (Explanation, Understanding, Re-telling, Prophecy). However, **Understanding** (*Lǐng Jiě*) and **Re-telling/Confirmation** (*Shù Chéng*) are both included within the **Prophecy Section**.<br>
*   **Reason:** If they did not understand, how could they receive prophecy or confirmation? Thus, it inherently possesses both meanings.<br>
*   **Textual Note:** Sometimes Understanding and Confirmation are before or after; sometimes Understanding is silent thought or spoken words. Because the text is brief, it is not sufficient to divide into separate chapters, so they are entered into other segments.<br>
*   **Division:**<br>
    1.  **This Chapter (Magic City):** Correctly explains **Causes and Conditions** (*Yīn Yuán*).<br>
    2.  **Next Two Chapters:** **Bestowal of Prophecy** (*Shòu Jì*).<br>

**2. Two Main Divisions of this Chapter:**<br>
*   **First:** Clarifying **Knowledge and Vision of the Long Ago** (*Zhī Jiàn Jiǔ Yuǎn*).<br>
*   **Second:** Clarifying **Past Lives Bonding** (*Sù Shì Jié Yuán*).<br>
*   **Rationale:** The Tathagata uses the **Three Reaches** (*Sān Dá* - Past, Present, Future knowledge). He sees the distant past as if it were today. The past events cited are definitely not false. Only then does he speak of Past Lives.<br>
*   **Format:** Both sections have Prose (*Cháng Xíng*) and Verse (*Jì Sòng*).<br>

**3. Knowledge of Long Ago (Prose):**<br>
1.  **Bringing forth the Seen Event:** Specifically, the [7] **Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Buddha** (*Dà Tōng Zhì Shèng Fó*), his Good Accomplishment (*Hǎo Chéng*), and Great Marks (*Dà Xiàng*).<br>
2.  **Citing Parables:** Clarifying the duration (Dust Moth Kalpas).<br>
3.  **Conclusion:** Seeing the past is like [seeing] today.<br>
*   **Verse:** Seven lines praise the first three meanings, as in the text.<br>

**4. Clarifying Bonding (Prose):**<br>
Divided into two: **Basis of Bonding** (*Jié Yuán Yóu*) and **Correctly Bonding** (*Zhèng Jié Yuán*).<br>
The Basis (*Yóu*) is further divided into **Distant Basis** (*Yuǎn Yóu*) and **Near Basis** (*Jìn Yóu*).<br>

**A. Distant Basis [4] (*Yuǎn Yóu*):**<br>
1.  **Buddha Life Span Long/Far:** "That Buddha originally sat"<br>
2.  **Events Before Attaining Way:** "That Buddha originally sat in the Way Place"<br>
    *   *Note:* Although the Way of all Buddhas is the same, the conditions/events differ. Shakyamuni practiced bitterness for six years, grass growing through his elbows, not noticing; gods weeping and shaking the earth, not hearing. Maitreya attains the Way on the very day of leaving home. That Buddha [Great Universal Wisdom Excellence] sat for ten kalpas with [the Way] not appearing. It is not that roots are sharp/dull or the Way is hard/easy; the conditions suitable for "Long" or "Short" respond accordingly.<br>
3.  **Correctly Attaining the Way:** "The Bhikshus passed ten small kalpas" clarifies the actual attainment.<br>
4.  **Offerings After Attaining:** "That Buddha not yet leaving the home" clarifies the retinue offerings after attainment.<br>
5.  **Requesting to Turn Wheel:** "At that time the sixteen Kings Verse Praise" clarifies the request to turn the Dharma Wheel.<br>
    *   *Note:* The first is easy to understand. The second (Before Attaining) has two parts: 1. Time passing at the Way Place; 2. Offerings by Gods.<br>
    *   **Brahma Request (Ten Directions):** Two parts: **Majestic Light Shaking** and **Ten-Direction Brahmas**.<br>
        *   **Majestic Light Shaking:** *Past Causes Sutra* says: "When Sarvasiddhartha was in the womb, the three-thousand worlds were brightly illuminated; places not lit by sun and moon were greatly brightened; beings there could see each other." At first enlightenment it was likewise: morning teaching the Form Heavens, midday teaching the Desire Heavens, afternoon teaching ghosts/spirits; at night also likewise.<br>
        *   **Contemplative Interpretation:** "Suddenly beings arise" means mind-nature is originally pure; when skandhas/entrances/realms cover [5] it, it becomes dark. If one cultivates contemplative wisdom, the original nature and principle manifest. The two mountains are the Two Truths; [6] between them is the Middle Way. Sun/moon light are the Two Wisdoms; Buddha light is the Middle Way. The light of non-discriminating wisdom illuminates the inherently existing Three Truths.<br>
        *   **Ten-Direction Brahmas:** The text has two parts: first the nine directions, then the upper direction. The nine directions are four: East, Southeast, South, and a general explanation of the remaining six. For the first three directions, each has seven items: seeing the omen, shock, mutual inquiry/confirmation, following the light to see the Buddha, three-karmas offerings, requesting Dharma, and silent permission—each as in the text. The upper direction Brahmas have only six items; the World-Honored One immediately speaks, so there is no silent permission.<br>
        *   **Old Explanation:** East and Southeast request the Small; the seven directions request the Great; the upper direction requests both Small and Great.<br>
        *   **Treatise View:** If the *Treatise* says Brahmas originally requested the Great, then even if the Buddha spoke the Small, it did not fulfill their request; if he spoke Prajna, it still repaid the Brahma request.<br>
        *   **Expedient Means Chapter:** Brahma kings request the Great, but the Buddha's Dharma path is the same and should not have partial requests. Sutras and treatises are brief; later teachers took partial evidence.<br>
        *   **Five Flavors Correspondence:** The present Buddha from beginning to end turns the Five-Flavors Dharma Wheel; each answers the Brahma request—so it should be the same there. First, the sixteen sons request turning the Full Teaching (like the present Buddha speaking *Avatamsaka*). East and Southeast request turning the Half Teaching (like the present Buddha speaking Tripitaka). The later seven directions request turning "Half vs. Full" (like the present Buddha speaking *Fangdeng*). The upper direction requests "Mixed Half/Full" (like the present Buddha speaking *Prajna*). Later, the sixteen sons request abandoning the Half and revealing the Full (like the present Buddha speaking *Lotus*, the ghee teaching). Thus the structure and meaning of ancient and present texts correspond (etc.).<br>

**B. Near Basis (*Jìn Yóu*):**<br>
Because the Buddha accepted the request to speak Dharma, later he could have the **Re-telling** (*Fù Jiǎng*) [by the Princes], which correctly makes the Bond.<br>
1.  **Turning the Half-Word Wheel** (*Zhuǎn Bàn Zì Fǎ Lún* - Four Truths).<br>
2.  **Princes Requesting Full-Word** (*Qǐng Zhuǎn Mǎn Zì* - One Vehicle).<br>

**5. Analysis of the "Three Turnings" (*Sān Zhuǎn*):**<br>
*   **Ideally (Introductory Chapter):** Should mention Three Vehicles (Six Paramitas, etc.). But here, for the sake of Lower Roots discussing Bonding and Opening/Revealing, it abbreviates and does not speak of Six Paramitas.<br>
*   **The Three Turnings:**<br>
    1.  **Demonstration (*Shì*):** [Demonstrating the Truth].<br>
    2.  **Exhortation (*Quàn*):** [Exhorting to Practice].<br>
    3.  **Realization/Witness (*Zhèng*):** [Verifying Attainment].<br>
    *   Also matches: **Demonstration Order** (*Shì Jiào*), **Benefit/Joy Order** (*Lì Xǐ* - Realization).<br>
    *   Also matches: **Vision of Truth** (Darśana-mārga), **Cultivation** (Bhāvanā-mārga), **No-Learning** (Aśaikṣa).<br>
    *   **Sravakas:** Three Turnings.<br>
    *   **Pratyekabuddhas:** Two Turnings.<br>
    *   **Bodhisattvas:** One Turning.<br>
*   *Why?* Due to Sharp vs. Dull roots. This is only a one-way explanation. Correctly, all cases have Three Turnings. Why? Because the Buddha's words/dharma reach the number Three, and living beings have three types of roots (Low, Middle, High). The *Great Treatise* and *Vibhasha* all make this explanation.<br>
*   **Q/A:**
    *   *Question:* Determine the Five Men—how do they make Three Roots? And the 80,000 Gods?
    *   *Answer:* To generate Three Wisdoms, Three Roots, and Three Paths.<br>

**6. Analysis of "Twelve Lines/Rows" (*Shí Èr Xíng*):**<br>
*   **Two Meanings:** 1. Regarding the **Four Truths Teaching**; 2. Regarding the **Sixteen Aspect Minds**.<br>
*   **Teaching Twelve:** That is, the Demonstration, Exhortation, and Realization [3 Turnings x 4 Truths = 12].<br>
*   **Activity/Line Twelve:** In the Three Turnings, all produce **Eye, Wisdom, Clarity, and Awakening** (*Yǎn Zhì Míng Jué*) [3 Turnings x 4 Aspects = 12].<br>
*   **Wheel Metaphor:**
    *   **Teaching Twelve** is the **Turner** (*Néng Zhuǎn*).
    *   **Activity Twelve** is the **Turned** (*Suǒ Zhuǎn*).
    *   **Twelve Lines are the Wheel; Twelve Teachings are not the Wheel.** (Or if making the Two Wheels meaning: Eye/Wisdom/Clarity/Awakening regarding 48 Dharmas, opening these four minds to form Sixteen Minds; Three Roots people each attain 16 Minds, thus 48 Lines).
    *   Twelve Truths are the **Teaching Wheel**. Twelve Lines are the **Activity Wheel**.
    *   The Teaching Wheel (Capable of Turning) is only the One Provisional Wisdom. The Activity Wheel (Object of Turning) has Twelve Teachings.<br>
    *   **If the Activity Wheel is the Turning:** The teaching that turns has Twelve, and the activity turned also has Twelve. It can apply to **Three Persons** or **One Person**. Here, regarding the three persons in the Seeing-Truth path: sharp roots hearing the Demonstration Turning immediately produce Eye/Wisdom/Clarity/Awakening. The three persons are combined, thus called **Twelve Lines**.<br>
*   **"What Mara/Brahma Cannot Turn":**
    *   Sravakas not hearing it cannot even [1] know it, let alone turn it.
    *   Pratyekabuddhas although awakened, cannot speak it.
    *   Brahmins although hearing the name, do not understand the principle.
    *   Maras/Brahmas also thus.
    *   *Turning* means transferring this Dharma to enter another's mind, causing them to awaken and break the 62 Views—this is named "Turning the Dharma Wheel." Because they lack this meaning, Maras/Brahmas cannot turn it.<br>
*   **Mahayana Interpretation:** Turning 4 Truths, then 2, then 1, then No Truth. This implies the "Rolling and Unrolling" (*Juǎn Shū*) of the teaching.<br>
*   **Substance:** Small Vehicle uses Birth/Extinction as Substance. Mahayana uses **Non-Birth** (*Wú Shēng*) as Substance.<br>
“As for the ‘Twelve Links of Dependent Arising’: it is still a detailed contemplation of the Four Truths in their specific aspects. In terms of Suffering and Accumulation there are ignorance and aging‑and‑death; in terms of Path and Cessation there are the cessation of ignorance up to the cessation of aging‑and‑death. Also, the three kinds of persons all contemplate the twelve links: for the two vehicles, the twelve links of arising‑and‑ceasing; for bodhisattvas, the twelve links of non‑arising. The twelve links of non‑arising are originally not born and now not extinguished; when there is arising it is only relative arising, and in succession it is relative extinction (etc.). Moreover, the three vehicles all in general discuss the Four Truths: for the two vehicles, limited Four Truths; for bodhisattvas, immeasurable Four Truths. The six pāramitās are also common to the three kinds of persons. The *Mahāprajñā* “Fāqù” chapter says: ‘Arhats and pratyekabuddhas reach the other shore by means of the six pāramitās.’ The *Mahāyānasaṃgraha* says: ‘Ordinary beings and the two vehicles all have the six pāramitās, only they differ.’ If so, all should be called pāramitās; yet the two vehicles’ practice reaching the nirvāṇa other shore is also called pāramitā, but they cannot reach the Buddha‑way’s other shore—therein they differ from bodhisattvas. The *Abhidharma* has six “legs”; [2] the six legs are precisely the six pāramitās. The *Baoyun Sūtra* explains the three‑vehicle vinaya (etc.). Third, those who hear the Dharma and awaken: few at first, many in the middle. ‘Not accepting’ means not accepting the four views, awakening the first fruit [3]. ‘Obtaining liberation’ means being freed from the two bonds of seed and fruit, attaining no‑learning. ‘Profound and wondrous samādhi’ is precisely the liberation of both (etc.).”<br>

「爾時十六[4]王子皆出家」下，第二，重請滿字法輪。文為七：一、出家，二、請法，三、所將亦出家，四、佛受請，五、時眾有解不解，六、時節，七、說已入定。「諸根」者，六根也，六根清淨故言通利。又六根互用故言「通」，入佛境界故言「利」。「智慧明了」者，開示悟入也，彼佛初說圓頓，諸子大乘功德悉皆具足，愍諸方便重請佛開權顯實也。「聲聞皆已成就」者，明其障除機動，是故為請。「我等志願如來知見」者，此《法華經》但明佛之知見，唯志於此，即正請滿字廢半之文，明顯若此也。「過二萬[5]劫」者，上開三既久，不容中間無事，望下文意，二萬劫中必說方等《般若》，文云「說六波羅蜜及諸神通事」，般若是行、神通是事，諸方等經多明不可思議事行也。頌中又云「分別真實法」，即是《大品》明實相般若意也。十六沙彌信受及二乘，即信得解者；其餘千萬皆生疑惑，是不解眾。此不解眾即與十六子，結法華之緣者也。第七，明說法已入定，[6]此正是結緣之近由。由佛入定不出，諸疑惑眾無所諮問，十六於後為不解者覆講說經也。文中明入定處所，即是靜室，正入定即是住於禪定，入定時節即是八萬四千劫(云云)。

**From “At that time the sixteen [4] princes all left home” downward:** Second, the repeated request to turn the full‑word Dharma wheel. The text has seven: (1) leaving home, (2) requesting Dharma, (3) those they led also leaving home, (4) the Buddha accepting the request, (5) at that time a multitude with understanding and non‑understanding, (6) the time period, (7) after speaking he enters samādhi. “Faculties” are the six faculties; because the six are pure, it is called penetrating and sharp. Because the six inter‑function, it is called “penetrating”; because they enter the Buddha realm, it is called “sharp.” “Wisdom is clear” means opening, showing, awakening, entering. That Buddha first spoke the perfect‑sudden; the princes’ Mahāyāna merit was fully complete; out of compassion for expedients they again request the Buddha to open the provisional and reveal the real. “The śrāvakas are already accomplished” clarifies their obstacles removed and capacities moving, so they request. “We aspire to the Tathāgata’s knowledge and vision” — the Lotus only clarifies Buddha knowledge‑and‑vision; they solely aspire to this. This is the direct request for the full‑word, abandoning the half; it is explicit. “After two‑ten‑thousand [5] kalpas”: since opening the three has already been long, there cannot have been no events in between; considering the text below, within those twenty thousand kalpas he must have spoken Vaipulya and Prajñā. The text says “speaking the six pāramitās and the matters of supernormal powers”; Prajñā is practice and supernormal powers are matters; many Vaipulya sūtras illuminate inconceivable practices. The gāthā also says “discriminating the true Dharma,” which is the *Great Prajñā*’s meaning of real‑mark Prajñā. The sixteen śrāmaṇeras’ faith‑acceptance and the two vehicles are those who believe and understand; the remaining thousands of ten‑thousands all give rise to doubt—these are the non‑understanding multitude. This non‑understanding multitude are those who, with the sixteen princes, formed the Lotus karmic bond. Seventh: after speaking he enters samādhi; [6] this is precisely the near cause of bonding. Because the Buddha enters samādhi and does not emerge, the doubting multitude have nowhere to ask; later the sixteen re‑explain the sūtra for those who do not understand. The text clarifies the place of entering samādhi: the quiet chamber; to enter samādhi is to abide in dhyāna‑samādhi; the time of entering samādhi is eighty‑four thousand kalpas (etc.).

「是時十六菩薩知佛入室」下，第二，正結緣。就此有二：先法說結緣，次譬說結緣。就法說有三：第一明昔日共結緣，第二明中間更相值遇，第三明今還說法華。第一有四：一者知佛入定，二者王子覆講，三者眾得利益，四佛從定起稱歎菩薩。由佛入定所以得說，佛知一化將畢不復熟此段之人，故令王子共其結緣；又知此等必由王子究竟得度，所以入定久而不出也(云云)。

「是十六沙彌」下，第一，知佛入定。「各升法座」下，第二，覆說《法華》。「一一皆度」下，第三，說法利益。皆發菩提心故云「度」，若初發心時誓願當作佛已過於世間，即是度七方便彼岸義也。「大通智勝過八萬」下，第四，佛從定起稱歎勸信。此中復二：一、正稱歎菩薩，二、「汝等皆當」下，勸物親近。勸物親近中[7]又二：先勸親近，次「所以者何」下，第[8]一、釋勸意，「佛告[9]諸比丘是十六」下，第二、明中間常相逢值。逢值有三種，若相逢遇常受大乘，此輩中間皆已成就不至于今；若相逢遇，遇其退大仍接以小，此輩中間猶故未盡，今得還聞大乘之教；三但論遇小不論遇大，則中間未度，于今亦不盡，方始受大乃至滅後得道者是也。

問：如上塵數多許時節，今始得羅漢，當知無生法忍何易可階。

答：一云，大聖善巧，依四悉檀作如是說，或說佛道長遠，或說佛易得，對治厭道長者說短，於道生輕易想者說長，或為發生宿善，或隨世間所欲，或為聞說長短即得入第一義，當知言如許劫方今得羅漢者，此是權行四悉檀，引諸實行令入道耳。

「諸比丘我今語汝彼佛」下，第三，明今日還說《法華》。此文復二：先會古今，後明還說《法華》。先會古今復二：一、結師之古今，二、會弟子古今。十六沙彌是古，八方作佛是今也。「諸比丘我等為沙彌各各」下，次會弟子，復二：一、會現在，二、會未來。現在復四：一、不退者，住三菩提也；二、此諸眾生退轉者，今住聲聞；三、「所以者何」下，釋退住意；四、「爾時所化無量」下，正結古今也。「及我滅度未來」下，第二，會未來弟子，復二：一、正會，二、「我滅度後復有」下釋疑。疑者云，現在者，得聞佛說《法華》得入一道，可是結緣之流；未來者，不聞《法華》而入滅度，此豈能捨小得入一乘？釋云，雖滅度之，終會得聞，我於餘國作佛得聞是經。「餘國」者，三乘通教有餘國也。「除諸如來方便說」者，斷疑也。三是方便說，其實無三也。

「諸比丘若如來」下，第二，正明今日還說《法華》。就此復三：一、時眾清淨，二、正說《法華》，三、釋前開三意。「涅槃時到」者，諸佛出世教道將畢之時，即說此經，如迦葉佛、日月燈明等，說此經竟即入涅槃，釋迦說《法華》竟仍唱當滅。「眾又清淨」者，即斷德也。「信解堅固」者，信即四不壞信，解即無漏正解。了達真諦具諸禪定，此智斷立也。爾時堪教大道，聞必信受也。復次「眾又清淨」者，得三藏教益免難也。「信解堅固」者，於方等教心相體信也。「了達空法」，聞般若教說法，於空法中心得了達，即轉教意也。「便集諸菩薩」下，正說《法華》。集菩薩是聚親族等，是說此經也。上釋親族法身大士影嚮眾，以此文驗之，其義明也。「集諸菩薩」是會親族，「及聲聞眾」是命其子也。「比丘當知如來方便」下，釋開三意也。若世無二乘得滅度者，何故如來前說權教？釋云，比丘當知如來方便，深知眾生有小性欲，著於五塵、弊於五濁，故先說三令破蔽免難，後說一也。

「譬如五百」下，第二譬者，有開、有合。開譬為二：第一、導師譬，譬上覆講共結大緣，即擬〈火宅〉之總譬、〈方便〉之略頌也；第二、將導譬，譬上中間相遇今還說《法華》也，若中間相逢從我聞法皆為三菩提者，不為此人設譬；若中間相逢于今有住聲聞地者，正為此人設第二譬也，即擬〈火宅〉之別譬、〈方便〉之廣頌。

就初導師譬，其文有五，即擬〈火宅〉總譬、〈方便〉略頌中之六意也。一、五百由旬譬。譬上未度之眾樂著諸有[A1]輪迴處所，即擬〈火宅〉中其家廣大三界無安、〈方便品〉安隱對不安隱處之意也。二、險難惡道譬。譬上未度之眾煩惱垢重，於如來智慧難信難解，即擬〈火宅〉中火起、〈方便品〉安隱對不安隱之法也。三、若有多眾譬，正譬上百千萬億種皆生疑惑不解之眾[1]生也，即擬〈火宅〉中三十子五百人、〈方便〉中知眾生性欲意也。四、欲過此道至珍寶處譬，舊不取，今取此譬譬上覆講《法華》，擬〈草喻〉中一味雨、〈火宅〉中唯有一門、〈方便品〉宣示佛道意也。五者、一導師譬，譬上第十六王子也，即〈藥草〉中密雲、〈火宅〉中長者、〈方便〉中[2]我今亦如是意也。

問：

此中作譬，那不作父子相失、長者驚入火宅、不虛等名耶？

答：

凡作譬名，各逐義便，上取機感有無，故言父子相失、父子相見；若取感應始赴機，故言驚入火宅；此中明將導眾人世世相值，那得言相失？先久結緣那得言始應？為此義故，不作相失、驚入名耳，而其意則通。

問：

何故不作不虛譬？

答：

上來已二十二番開權顯實，其義已彰不虛。本欲勸信，下根信在不久，故不須也。

<div class="english-translation">
**1. Correctly Bonding (*Zhèng Jié Yuán*):**<br>
Divided into two: **Dharma Explanation** (*Fǎ Shuō*) and **Parable Explanation** (*Pì Shuō*).<br>
**A. Dharma Explanation Section:** Divided into three parts:<br>
1.  **Past Days Mutual Bonding:** Knowing the Buddha entered samadhi, Princes re-telling, Crowd gaining benefit, Buddha praising.<br>
    *   **Reason for Samadhi:** The Buddha knew the transforming work was ending and he would not mature this segment of people again. Thus, he let the Princes make the bond with them. Also, he knew these people must be ultimately saved by the Princes.<br>
2.  **Intermediate Encounters:** Clarifying that in between, they met each other again.<br>
3.  **Today Returning to Speak:** Clarifying that now he returns to preach the *Lotus Sutra*.<br>

**2. Details of Past Bonding:**<br>
*   **Princes Re-telling:** "Each ascended the Dharma Seat" (*Gè Shēng Fǎ Zuò*).<br>
*   **Benefit:** "One by one, all were saved." Saved means generating the **Bodhicitta**. If at the initial time one swears to become a Buddha, one has already surpassed the world.<br>
*   **Buddha Praising:** "Great Universal Wisdom Excellence arose from samadhi"<br>
    *   **Praising:** Praising the Bodhisattvas.<br>
    *   **Exhorting [7]:** "You should all draw near to them."<br>

**3. Intermediate Encounters [8] (*Zhōng Jiān Cháng Xiāng Féng Zhí*):**<br>
Three types of encounters:<br>
1.  **Always Accepting Great:** Those who met and always accepted the Mahayana are already accomplished and not here today.<br>
2.  **Retreating to Small:** Those who met, retreated from the Great, but were still received/connected (*Jiē*) with the Small. These people are not yet exhausted, so today they return to hear the Mahayana teaching.<br>
3.  **Only Meeting Small:** Those who only met the Small (not Great) in the intermediate encounters. Thus in the middle they were not saved; even until today they are not exhausted [of birth/death]. They are just beginning to accept the Great, up to those who attain the Way after [Buddha's] Extinction.<br>

**4. Q/A: Difficulty of Stages (*Nàn Xìn*):**<br>
*   **Question:** If so many kalpas have passed, and only now they attain Arhatship, we should know that **Non-Arising Dharma Patience** (*Wú Shēng Fǎ Rěn*) is extremely hard to climb/reach.<br>
*   **Answer:**<br>
    *   The Great Sage uses **Skillful Means** (*Shàn Qiǎo*). Relying on the **Four Siddhāntas**, he speaks like this.<br>
    *   Sometimes quoting "Long," sometimes "Short."<br>
    *   **Therapeutic:** For those weary of the long path, he says "Short." For those treating the path lightly, he says "Long."<br>
    *   **Provisional Wisdom:** Saying it takes "This many kalpas to attain Arhatship" is the **Worldly Siddhānta** of provisional practice, guiding people to enter the True Path.<br>

**5. Today Returning to Speak Lotus (*Jīn Rì Huán Shuō Fǎ Huá*):**<br>
*   **Connecting Ancient and Modern (*Huì Gǔ Jīn*):**<br>
    *   **Teachers:** 16 Novices (Ancient) = 8 Directions Buddhas (Modern).<br>
    *   **Disciples:**<br>
        *   **Non-Retreating:** Dwelling in Bodhi.<br>
        *   **Retreating:** Dwelling in Sravaka.<br>
    *   **Explanation of Retreating:** "Why? Because"<br>
    *   **Conclusion:** [9] "At that time the 16" concludes the Ancient/Modern.<br>
*   **Connecting Future Disciples:**<br>
    *   **Doubt:** Those who don't hear the Lotus now and enter Nirvana—how can they enter the One Vehicle?<br>
    *   **Answer:** Even if they enter Nirvana, they will eventually hear it. "I will become a Buddha in another land and they will hear this sutra." (*Yú Guó Zuò Fó*).<br>
    *   **Clarification:** "Other Land" refers to the **Land of Convenience with Remainder** (*Yǒu Yú Guó*).<br>
    *   **Cutting Doubt:** "Except for the Tathagata's skillful means/provisional teachings" (*Chú Zhū Rú Lái Fāng Biàn Shuō*). The "Three" are provisional; in reality, there is no Three.<br>

**"From 'Bhikshus, If the Tathagata' [Knows Time of Nirvana]":** This is the Second, Correctly Explaining **Today Returning to Speak the Lotus**. This has three parts:
    1.  **Time/Assembly Pure:**
        *   **"Time of Nirvana Arrived":** When the teaching path of Buddhas is about to end, they speak this Sutra.
            *   *Examples:* **Sun Moon Lamp Bright Buddha, 20,000 Lamp Brights, Great Universal Wisdom Excellence, Shakyamuni**—all speak this Sutra and then immediately enter Nirvana.
            *   *Text Support:* This Sutra says "Now I am also like this," confirming implied immediate Nirvana.
            *   **Question:** Shakyamuni spoke the *Lotus*, but then spoke the *Nirvana Sutra*. How can you say he "immediately entered"?
            *   **Answer:** The Buddha announced his extinction right then. "Announcing extinction" means the *Time* for the Function had arrived (even if physical death was slightly later).
        *   **"Assembly Again Pure":** This is **Severing Virtue** (*Duàn Dé*).
        *   **"Faith/Understanding Firm" (*Xìn Jiě Jiān Gù*):**
            *   Faith is the **Four Indestructible Faiths**.
            *   Understanding is **Non-Leaking Correct Understanding**.
            *   Penetrating the Real Truth, possessing all Dhyanas—this establishes Wisdom and Severing.
            *   At that time, capable of being taught the Great Way; hearing it, they definitely accept it.
            *   *Alternative:* "Assembly Again Pure" means obtaining Tripitaka benefits and escaping difficulties. "Faith/Understanding Firm" means trusting the Fangdeng Teaching. "Penetrating Emptiness Dharmas" means hearing Prajna Teaching and penetrating the principle of emptiness.
            *   **The Three Turnings (*Sān Zhuǎn*):**
                *   **Definition:** First **Indication** (*Shì*), Next **Exhortation** (*Quàn*), Last **Witness/Proof** (*Zhèng*).
                *   **History:** At first enlightenment, turned for 5 people (PC5). Middle turned for 3 people. Later turned for 1,000 people.
                *   **Capacity:** Corresponding to Sharp, Dull, and Middle people.
                *   **Contrast:** This *Lotus Sutra* differs from those. It has **Only One Turning, Only One Time, Only One Person**. Therefore, the text says "Will not turn (the wheel) again" (*Gèng Bù Zhuǎn Yě*)—meaning no further provisional turnings are needed.
    2.  **Correctly Speaking Lotus:** "Then gathers all Bodhisattvas" Gathering Bodhisattvas is grouping the relatives; speaking this Sutra to them. "And Sravaka multitude" is commanding the sons. The earlier explanation of the **Kinship Assembly** as Dharma-body great bodhisattvas in the supporting audience is verified by this passage.
    3.  **Explaining Previous 'Opening Three' Meaning:** "Bhikshus should know, the Tathagata's Expedient Means" If there are no Two Vehicles entering Nirvana, why did the Tathagata previously preach the Provisional? Answer: Deeply knowing beings have **Small Nature Desires**, attached to Five Dusts, obstructed by Five Turbidities; thus first preached Three to break obstructions/escape difficulties, later speaking One.

**6. The Guide Parable (Five Correspondences) (*Dǎo Shī Pì*):**
*   **Opened into two parts:**
    1.  **The Guide Parable:** Metaphor for the **Re-telling and Bonding** in the past.
        *   Matches the **General Parable** (Six References) of the *Burning House*.
        *   Matches the **Brief Verse** of *Expedient Means*.
    2.  **The Leading/Conducting Parable (*Jiāng Dǎo Pì*):** Metaphor for the **Intermediate Encounter** and **Today's Teaching**.
        *   Matches the **Specific Parable** of the *Burning House*.
        *   Matches the **Wide Verse** of *Expedient Means*.
    *   **Why a Second Parable:** If those met in the intermediate encounters all heard from the Buddha and became **Unsurpassed Bodhi**, there would be no need to set up this parable. Because some who met in between now dwell in the **Sravaka stage**, the second parable is established specifically for them.

*   **The Five Elements of the Guide Parable (Matching *Burning House*):**
    1.  **500 Yojanas Parable:** Metaphor for the **Unsaved Multitudes** delighting in the Place of Samsara [A1]. Matches the *Burning House* (the house is vast; the three realms have no peace) and *Expedient Means* (safe vs. unsafe place).
    2.  **Dangerous Evil Road Parable:** Metaphor for the **Unsaved Multitudes** having heavy defilements/afflictions, hard to believe or understand the Tathagata's wisdom. Matches the *Burning House* fire and *Expedient Means* (safe vs. unsafe dharmas).
    3.  **"If there are Many Multitudes" (*Ruò Yǒu Duō Zhòng*) Parable:** Directly metaphors the "Living Beings of the Hundred-Thousand-Million kinds" in the *Burning House*. Matches the *Burning House*'s thirty children/five hundred people and *Expedient Means*' knowing beings' desires.
    4.  **Desiring to Cross this Road to Treasure Place:** (Old masters didn't take this; Tiantai takes it). Metaphors the **Covering/Re-telling of the Lotus**. Matches *Herbs Parable*'s **One-Flavor Rain**, *Burning House*'s **Single Door**, and *Expedient Means*' proclamation of the **Buddha Path**.
    5.  **One Guide Parable:** Metaphors the **16th Prince** (The Father/Teacher). Matches *Medicinal Herbs*' **Dense Cloud**, *Burning House*'s **Elder**, and *Expedient Means*' [2] **"I am also like this"** meaning.
        *   *Qualities:* "Clever" (*Cōng*) = Pure Eyes/Ears. "Sharp" (*Lì*) = Pure Will. "Illuminated" (*Míng*) = Three Wisdoms. "Reaching" (*Dá*) = Ten Powers.



**8. Q/A: Naming the Parable:**<br>
*   **Question:** Here making a parable, why not make "Father and Son Losing Each Other," or "Elder Shocked Entering Fire House," or "Not False/Empty" names?<br>
*   **Answer:**
    *   Making parable names follow the **Meaning/Convenience** (*Yì Biàn*).
    *   Above (Parable Chapter) took "Capacity/Response Existing/Not Existing," thus "Father and Son Losing Each Other" (No Response) and "Father and Son Meeting" (Response).
    *   If taking "Response beginning to approach Capacity," thus "Shocked Entering Fire House."
    *   **Here:** Clarifying the Guide leading the magnitude of people, **Life after Life meeting Each Other**—how can we say "Losing Each Other"?
    *   Previously "Long Bonded," how can we say "Beginning to Respond"?
    *   For this meaning, we do not make "Losing" or "Shocked Entering" names; but the intent permeates.<br>
*   **Question:** Why not make "Not False" parable?<br>
*   **Answer:** Previously 22 times Opening Provisional Revealing Real; the meaning is already displayed as Not False. Originally intending to Exhort Faith—Lower Roots faith is not far off, thus no need.<br>
    *   Parable names follow the **Meaning/Function** (*Zhú Yì Biàn*).<br>
    *   **Burning House:** Focuses on "Response to Capacity" (*Jī Gǎn*), gaining and losing the Father.<br>
    *   **Here:** Focuses on **Leading/Conducting** (*Jiāng Dǎo*) and **Mutual Encounter life after life**. How can you say "Lost Each Other"? Since the bond was formed long ago, how can you say "Shocked/Startled Entry"?<br>
    *   Therefore, the names "Lost" or "Shocked" are not used, though the intent communicates.<br>
*   **Question:** Why is there no "Not False" (*Bù Xū*) parable here (like in Ch. 3)?<br>
*   **Answer:** The text has already "Opened the Provisional to Reveal the Real" 22 times. The meaning that it is "Not False" is already manifest. The Lower Roots will believe soon, so it is not needed.<br>

### 4. Doctrinal Analysis of the 500 Yojanas (Lines 221-240)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「五百由旬」者，基師：三界結惑為三百，七地所斷習氣為四百，八地已上所斷無明為五百。今謂非正別義，又非三乘通義。又有家云，流來生死、變易生死、中間生死、分段生死，但取三種開為五百，不取流來；流來是有識之初、反源之始，故不說之。

有人難此云，《勝鬘》云「因五果二」，果二者謂分段、變易；因五者謂五住。語果既別開流來與中間，語因亦應更廣五住。無據不可用。《大論》明肉身菩薩即分段，法身菩薩謂變易。又云，阿羅漢捨三界報身受法性身，故知生死二耳。

有人云，三百喻三界，四百喻七地，二國中間難過，五百喻八地已上。難者言，四百喻七地，則應三百喻六地，六地與二乘齊功，二乘極久唯六十劫、或百劫，菩薩至六地時，二十二大僧祇，二乘於佛道紆迴不應得齊。今謂此非別義亦非通義。

有人言，三界為三百，七住及二乘為四百，七住已上為五百，如《大經》云「初果八萬劫至菩提心處」，如三根人至此處即領解，五種人至此處名度五百也，此取極鈍故云八萬劫到，利人不必爾，如佛世得四果者，聞《法華》皆發心，何必八萬劫？難云，經明度三百由旬立二地，豈是度三人也？若五人並發菩提心名度五百者，乃大經之一意，明五人發心離於五位，非此中意。此中明三百是權度在化城，五百至寶所名實度，廢化城進寶所，若五人皆度皆進，失化城譬意。

有人云，三界為三百，聲聞為四百，緣覺地為五百，凡夫三界障，二乘涅槃障，亦是有空二見。《華嚴》藥樹不生深水火坑，火坑即三界，深水即二乘，三界是二乘之牢獄，二乘是菩薩之牢獄，又是福智二邊，不能自行不能化他。《大品》明四百由旬，合二乘為一百，《法華》開為五百。《大品》明菩薩度凡聖二地，未明二乘是權，闕化城之意，既未論化城，亦未明寶所。答：《大品》已顯實故辨寶所，未開權不明化城。下文云「為止息故說二涅槃」，此令度三百由旬也。「汝所住地近於佛慧」，此令出二百由旬也。文既分明，無勞惑也。

又明二乘，六義同、十義別，同出三界、同盡無生、同斷正使、同得有餘無餘、同得一切智、同名小乘，所以合為一化城。別開十義：行因久近，六[1]十劫、百劫故；根利鈍；從師獨悟無悲鹿羊；有相無相；觀略廣；能說得四果法，不能說法得煖法；在佛世不在佛世；頓證漸證；多現通少說法，聲聞不定。火宅三車今為二百，三根同為火宅所燒，三根求出故三車；佛道長遠，二乘是惡道，故二百須離。佛乘非障，但明二百，何故約凡開三、約聖開二？此引進之言耳。所度猶少、未度猶多，若爾未成了義。佛道雖長如萬里行，但五百是難、餘者則易。

問：二百是二乘難，三界是凡夫難，菩薩有難不？菩薩不以火宅為難，不應求車而出。既求車出，何不為二百所障(云云)？《大論》六十六云「險道是世間，一百由旬是欲界，二百色界，三百無色界，四百是二乘。」又倒出數，一百是二乘道，二百是無色，三百是色界，四百是欲界。此經明五百由旬即菩薩道，若過五百即入佛道(云云)。

人師及經論異出，如前。今依此經判之。三界果報處為三百，有餘國處為四百，實報國處為五百。下文合譬云知諸生死，生死即是處所明矣。但佛旨難知，更須廣解。見惑為一百，五下分為二百，五上分為三百，塵沙為四百，無明為五百，下文合譬云煩惱險難惡道義相扶也。入空觀能過三百，入假觀能過四百，入中觀能過五百，下文合譬云善知險道通塞之相，即雙知因果二種五百義相扶也。

二，「險難惡道」者，譬生死因果也，分段、變易此即果險難也，見思五住即因險難也，由此因果故言惡道也。「無人」者，道有二種：一、曠絕有人可依，二、無人可依。譬生死中有涅槃、煩惱中有菩提，雖復曠絕則有人可依。若生死煩惱無涅槃菩提，藥中無病、病中無藥，此則曠絕無人可依也。三，「若有多眾」者，此譬王子所化未度之眾也。四，「欲過此險道」，求至種覺，故言「至珍寶處」也。五，「有一導師」者，即第十六王子也。眼耳清淨曰「聰」，意清淨曰「利」，總而言之即六根清淨也。智即一心三智也，「明」即具足五眼也。又三明為「明」，十力為「達」。

**1. Debates on the 500 Yojanas (*Wǔ Bǎi Yóu Xún*):**<br>
Zhiyi reviews and refutes multiple past interpretations:<br>
    *   **Master Ji (*Jī Shī*) says:** 300=Three Realms, 400=Traces cut on 7th Ground, 500=Ignorance cut on 8th Ground. *Critique:* Not the correct Specific Meaning, nor the General Meaning of the Three Vehicles.
<br>
    *   **There is a House/School that says (*Yǒu Jiā Yún*):** 300 = Flowing/Transformation/Intermediate/Fragmentary Birth & Death. *Critique:* No scriptural basis. *Srimala Sutra* only cites "Five Causes, Two Results."
<br>
    *   **Someone critiques this, saying (*Yǒu Rén Nàn Cǐ Yún*):** 400=7th Ground. *Critique:* If so, 300=6th Ground. But 6th Ground Bodhisattvas have practiced for 22 Asankhyeya Kalpas. How can they be equal to Sravakas (60 kalpas)?
<br>
    *   **Someone says (*Yǒu Rén Yán*):** 300=Three Realms. 400=7 Abodes/2 Vehicles. 500=7 Abodes+.
<br>
*   **Someone says (*Yǒu Rén Yún*):** 300=Three Realms. 400=Sravaka. 500=Pratyekabuddha. *Critique:* *Prajnaparamita* (Da Pin) combines 2 Vehicles into 100 (Total 400). *Lotus* opens it to 500.
<br>
*   **Comparison:** *Prajnaparamita* reveals the Real (Treasure Trove) but doesn't fully explain the Provisional (Magic City). *Lotus* explains both.<br>

**Two Vehicles: Six Shared Meanings, Ten Differences:**<br>
Shared six: both exit the Three Realms; both exhaust non-arising; both cut the proper afflictions; both attain with-remainder and without-remainder; both attain all-knowledge; both are called the Small Vehicle--therefore they are combined as one Magic City.<br>
Ten differences:<br>
1.  Length of causal practice (60 kalpas vs 100).<br>
2.  Sharp vs dull roots.<br>
3.  From a teacher vs self-awakened; lacking compassion (deer/ram).<br>
4.  With marks vs without marks.<br>
5.  Contemplation brief vs broad.<br>
6.  Can teach the dharma for attaining the four fruits; cannot teach and only attains the Warmth stage.<br>
7.  In the Buddha's time vs not in the Buddha's time.<br>
8.  Sudden realization vs gradual realization.<br>
9.  Display many supernormal powers vs speak little Dharma.<br>
10. Sravaka not fixed (classification unsettled).<br>
Fire-House three carts are now 200: the three roots are burned by the burning house; the three roots seek exit, therefore three carts. The Buddha-path is long and far; the Two Vehicles are an evil road, therefore the 200 must be left behind. The Buddha-vehicle is not an obstruction--why, for ordinary beings, open three, but for saints open two? This is language of guiding-in. Those already crossed are few; those not yet crossed are many--if so, this is not yet definitive. Though the Buddha-path is long like a ten-thousand-li journey, the 500 are the difficulty; the rest are easy.<br>
**Q&A on the 200 Yojanas (Great Treatise, Fascicle 66):**<br>
**Q:** If 200 is the Two-Vehicle difficulty and the Three Realms are the ordinary-being difficulty, do bodhisattvas have a difficulty? Bodhisattvas do not take the burning house as a difficulty, so they should not seek a cart to exit. If they seek the cart to exit, why are they not obstructed by the 200? (etc.)<br>
**A:** The *Great Treatise* (*Da Lun*) fascicle 66 says: the perilous road is the world; 100 yojanas = Desire Realm, 200 = Form Realm, 300 = Formless Realm, 400 = Two Vehicles. It also reverses the numbers: 100 = Two-Vehicle path, 200 = Formless, 300 = Form, 400 = Desire. This sutra clarifies that 500 yojanas are the bodhisattva path; passing beyond 500 one enters the Buddha path. (etc.)<br>

**2. Zhiyi's Determination (*Jīn Yī Cǐ Jīng Pàn Zhī*):**<br>
Relying on the Lotus Text:<br>
*   **300 Yojanas:** The Place of **Result Retribution of the Three Realms** (*Sān Jiè Guǒ Bào Chù*).<br>
*   **400 Yojanas:** The Place of the **Land with Remainder** (*Yǒu Yú Guó*).<br>
*   **500 Yojanas:** The Place of the **Land of Real Reward** (*Shí Bào Guó*).<br>
*   *Text Proof:* "Knowing all Births and Deaths." Birth/Death refers to *Places*.<br>

**3. Detailed Causal Analysis (*Yīn Guǒ Wǔ Bǎi*):**<br>
To understand the "Difficulties/Afflictions" (*Xiǎn Nàn*):<br>
1.  **100 Yojanas:** **View Delusions** (*Jiàn Huò*).<br>
2.  **200 Yojanas:** **Five Lower Bonds** (*Wǔ Xià Fēn*).<br>
3.  **300 Yojanas:** **Five Upper Bonds** (*Wǔ Shàng Fēn*). (Exiting here = Arhat).<br>
4.  **400 Yojanas:** **Dust and Sand Delusions** (*Chén Shā*).<br>
5.  **500 Yojanas:** **Fundamental Ignorance** (*Wú Míng*).<br>
*   *Observation Mapping:*<br>
    *   **Empty View:** Crosses 300.<br>
    *   **Provisional View:** Crosses 400.<br>
    *   **Middle View:** Crosses 500.<br>

**4. Guide Parable Elements:**<br>
*   **"Dangerous Evil Road":** Metaphor for Birth/Death Causes and Effects (Fragmentary and Mutational).<br>
*   **"No Person" (*Wú Rén*):** A road with "No Person to Rely On." In Samsara without Nirvana, there is no one to rely on. (Like sickness without medicine).<br>
*   **"Many Multitudes":** The bond-forming beings who haven't crossed.<br>
*   **"Treasure Trove":** Species Wisdom (*Zhǒng Jué*).<br>
*   **"One Guide":** The 16th Prince (Sakyamuni). "Clear Eyes/Ears" = Clever (*Cōng*). "Clear Will" = Sharp (*Lì*). Having the Three Knowledges and Five Eyes.<br>

<div class="english-translation">
**“From ‘Leading the Multitude’”:** This is the second, the **Leading/Conducting Parable**. It matches the intent of the *Burning House* and *Expedient Means* separate parable and wide verse. This text has three parts:<br>
1.  **Parable of the People Being Led:** Metaphors those who, in the original bonding, had not yet been crossed. The original bond is not lost, and they are led by the guide. This corresponds to the *Burning House* elder seeing the fire and being frightened, and the *Expedient Means* seeing the five turbidities and arousing great compassion.<br>
2.  **Parable of Slackening Mid‑Road:** Metaphors the intermediate encounter—retreating from the Great Vehicle and then being received with the Small. This corresponds to the *Burning House* not using hands/body but praising the three carts as rare, and to the *Expedient Means* stopping the Great‑Vehicle conversion‑thought and using expedients.<br>
3.  **From “At that time the guide knew these people” onward:** Parable of **extinguishing the magic and leading to the treasure place**. It metaphors returning to speak the *Lotus Sutra*, gathering bodhisattvas and śrāvakas to speak this sutra—matching the *Burning House* giving one great cart and *Expedient Means* only speaking the unsurpassed path.<br>
*Parsing complete.* Next, explanation: “People being led” in general are the bonded multitude; specifically, those who previously received great benefit have already been led; those who have not received great benefit are precisely those led; or, among the 500 people/30 sons, those not yet awakened.<br>
“Slackening mid‑road” is the second parable. The text has two: (1) retreating from the Great; (2) receiving the Small. Retreating from the Great corresponds above to **stopping the One**; receiving the Small corresponds above to **applying the Three**. Retreating has three: (1) “slackening mid‑road” = above, no Great‑vehicle capacity; (2) “telling the guide” = above, not receiving exhortation/discipline; “we are exhausted” = not receiving exhortation; “and further fearful” = not receiving discipline; (3) “cannot go forward” = above, stopping the transformation. *Parsing complete.* Next explanation:<br>
**“Mid‑road”** is not literal halfway; resolve is the beginning and Buddhahood the end, and between these two pillars the thought of retreat arises—hence “mid‑road.” **“Telling the guide”** includes: a general compassionate guide (“a guide leading the multitude”), a bond‑forming guide (“the people led told the guide”), a provisional‑wisdom guide (“the guide has many expedients”), and a real‑wisdom guide (“the guide knew these people”). Here “told the guide” means the bond‑forming guide. Retreating from the Great makes the Great cease; receiving the Small makes the Small arise—one arising and one ceasing respond to the Dharma‑body; this is called “telling.” The prince knows their retreat from the Great—that is, he hears what they told. Good roots are weak and covered by ignorance; thus “exhausted.” Fear of birth and death is called “fearful.” **“Cannot advance; the road ahead is far”** refers to view‑thought, dust‑sand, and ignorance delusions being hard to cut quickly; yet by receiving with the Small Vehicle they are not suddenly returned to the original place, and there is still a sense of progress.<br>
From “The guide has many expedients” downward is the second part—**receiving with the Small**. Above, *Burning House* and *Expedient Means* opening the Three Vehicles have four meanings; here they are complete: (1) “many expedients” parable = fitting suitability; (2) from “and he thought thus” = lamenting the loss of the treasure, knowing there is Small and no Great; (3) from “having thought thus” = conjuring the city, properly using expedients; (4) from “at that time the exhausted multitude” = entering the city, the Three Vehicles awakening/entering. The first two are as the text says. The conjured‑city parable again has two: first conjuring, then speaking. “By the power of expedients” is the actual conjuring; “telling the multitude” is the speaking. In the cart parable it said, “I made this cart for you.” Here the city is existent, so it must first be made. Explaining the conjured‑city parable corresponds to **exhortation, demonstration, and proof**: “Do not fear; do not return” = exhortation turning, leading them to enter the city. “Now this is a great city… you may act as you wish” = demonstration turning, showing it is a place to dwell. “If you enter this city you will quickly gain peace and joy [1]” = proof turning, praising its safety.<br>
“From here to the treasure place you can also go”: In the Tripitaka teaching, advancing beyond was not discussed. One explanation: when explaining the Three Vehicles, if one arouses Mahayana seeking Buddhahood, that is good; if unable, one may take the [2] Two Vehicles—e.g., *Śrīmālā* says “those of the Three Vehicles at the first stage are not deluded about the Dharma”; they know they should become Buddhas but are tired and cannot bear it, so they take permanent extinction. If so, it becomes the Distinct Teaching. Another says: after entering the conjured city, then advance; *Da Pin* and *Vimalakīrti* have this meaning—this is the Distinct‑meeting‑Common intent. But before the present Buddha has opened and revealed, one must not openly say this; regarding past lives, one should have spoken thus. Why? Knowing their retreat, the prince teaches: if you fear birth and death, first take the rest of Nirvana, then practice the great path; likewise today, if one fears birth and death and wants to retreat, someone advises: first cut afflictions and certify Arhatship, then later take the great path. In this present lifetime, the teaching work is not yet complete, so one must not suddenly say this; once the provisional is opened and the real revealed, one may say it—this is the meaning of those who take Arhatship in the *Nirvana Sutra*.<br>
“Great joy” = hearing‑wisdom; “never had” = warm stage; “freed from evil paths” = summit stage; “quick peace” = patience stage; “entering the city before” = seeing‑truth stage; “already passed the thought” = no‑learning stage—matching the *Burning House*’s apt [3] son who courageously pushes them out of the house. “Already passed the thought” is like attaining exhaustion‑knowledge; “peaceful thought” is like attaining non‑arising‑knowledge. It also has wisdom‑virtue as “already passed,” and severing‑virtue as “peaceful.”<br>
Someone says the treasure place is: once the three realms and two vehicles are passed, one reaches the Buddha‑path; the Buddha‑path is the treasure place. The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sutra* has three passages: (1) reaching bodhicitta, (2) reaching bodhi, (3) reaching the gate of great nirvana. If one reaches bodhicitta, one must reach bodhi and nirvana. These three passages show: bodhicitta is cause; bodhi and nirvana are fruit. In the fruit there is wisdom and severing: bodhi is wisdom, nirvana is severing. It explains beginning/end and wisdom/severing, hence three passages. Yet passing five hundred has three meanings: (1) escaping evil paths, (2) obtaining a good road, (3) reaching the treasure place. Bodhicitta is crossing the evil path; bodhi practice is like a level road; the third is reaching Buddhahood as the treasure place. The later text says, “Now I tell you the truth: what you obtained is not real”—this clarifies crossing the five‑hundred evil path; “for the Buddha’s all‑wisdom you should arouse great vigor” means practicing the bodhi good road; “you will realize all‑wisdom, the ten powers, and other Buddha‑dharmas” means attaining the Buddha‑path. Why must one cross five hundred? The Two Vehicles cross three hundred, bodhisattvas cross four hundred, and the Buddha‑vehicle crosses five hundred.<br>

**“From ‘At that time the guide knew this’”:** Third, **extinguishing the magic and leading to the treasure place**. This has two parts: (1) knowing they have rested; (2) directing toward the treasure place. “Having already attained rest and no longer being weary” metaphors the above: the time of Nirvana arrives, the assembly is again pure and free of difficulty, and the great capacity is aroused. “Immediately extinguishing the conjured city” leads them toward the treasure place, metaphorizing the above **correctly speaking the *Lotus* and revealing true reality**. The treasure place has two meanings: if taken as **ultimate**, then the treasure place is the ultimate fruit—above it says, “Only Buddha and Buddha can fully know[4] the real mark of all dharmas.” If taken as **partial entry**, then the treasure place is the first arousal of bodhicitta; thus above it says, “The unsurpassed treasure‑heap is obtained without seeking,” and also “obtaining a share of Buddha‑dharma”—what the Buddha’s children ought to obtain they have already obtained. The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sutra* says, “A srota‑āpanna reaches it in eighty‑thousand kalpas”—that is, reaching the place of first arousing bodhicitta. This is for dull roots, letting them progress in eighty‑thousand or ten‑thousand [kalpas]; but as in the Tripiṭaka’s four fruits, they can enter the Great without long time—why must there be eighty‑thousand or ten‑thousand? (etc.).<br>

“The treasure place is near; the great city before was what I conjured”—this raises the **abandoning‑provisional** parable to attach the **revealing‑real** parable. Above it says, “The Tathagata’s wisdom is hard to believe and understand; these people should gradually enter Buddha‑wisdom by this Dharma,” corresponding to *Expedient Means* saying, “ [5]I caused them to be freed from the bonds of suffering and to attain Nirvana”—the Buddha uses expedient power to show the Three Vehicles teaching.<br>

舊問：車城皆譬無生智，車何故無？城何故有？而車三城一、車動城靜？

答：長者道門外有車，有隔故諸子不見，可得假設門外有車，車實無也；城在逈地不得假設，故城是有也。就理教者，執三教取理，則三教皆得理，此即有義如城也；將理取教，理既唯一，此教即無三家之果，即車義據無也。車三城一者，諸人同息一處，所以城一也；車就三人，三人所樂不同故三。理教者，三家盡無生不異，如城；三人正使雖同盡，而習氣有盡不盡，有傍得知見，有不得者，故用此莊嚴盡無生，此義不同如三車。三家盡無生智，明因盡果亡，此處是極，如城靜；盡無生智運入無餘，如車動也。難(云云)。今明約眾生心，車、城俱有；約佛智明，亦有亦無。權智所明為有，如城；實智所明為無，如車(云云)。化城正意為退大取小人，傍為發軫學小人。上二周正意，為發軫學小人，傍為退大人也。三車通今昔，化城正是引教意，未道是化也。

問：化為三車，與化城何異？

答：三車為說法輪作譬，化城為神通輪作譬。又車約聲作譬，諸子聞而不見；城為色作譬。問：城與二使云何？使能指示，如教[1]詮理；城為息患，教動而城靜。教即四諦、十二緣有異；城是二智入無餘不異。教通因果；城車但在果。教通有為無為；城車但在無為。權智謂車是無，名教施設故；實智謂車是有，無離文字說解脫故。權智照城為有，引眾生故；實智照城是無，偏真非實故。權智照車是三，逗三緣故；實智照車是一，俱會一乘故。權智照城為一，是偏真故；實智照城為三，如來藏故。權智照城為靜，是灰斷故；實智照城為動，滅此化故。權智照車為運，運入無餘故；實智照車為靜，不動不出故。作如此釋豈與舊同？舊[2]秖在小乘中作義。

問：凡五處開三顯一，為有何異？

答：通論無異，別論有差。〈方便品〉約教開三顯一，文云「如來但以一佛乘故，為眾生說法，無二亦無三」也。〈火宅〉約行開三顯一，車是運義，運則譬行，文云「各乘大車遊於四方，嬉戲快樂」也。〈信解〉中約人開三顯一，結會傭作之人即是長者之兒，「我等[A2]昔來真是佛子」也。〈藥草喻〉中，約差別無差別明權實，不的去取，但明眾生不知，佛令其知。若七種差別即知權，同依一理無差別即知實。差別無差別，無差別而差別，令知此意耳，終不說言無一有一，此約自行權實二智隨自意語，故佛能知而眾生不知也。亦是通前通後，知不知明權實也。今化城正約理開三顯一，寶所化城，皆是小大兩理，破除二乘化理，顯於寶所真實一理也。下去五百領解舉珠為[3]譬，亦是約理也。

**1. Q/A: Three Cars vs. One City (*Sān Chē Yī Chéng*):**<br>
*   **Old Question:** Both metaphor Non-Outflow Wisdom. Why is the Car "Non-Existent" (Provisional) and the City "Existent"? Why are there 3 Cars but 1 City? Why does the Car "Move" and the City "Stay Static"?<br>
*   **Answer:**<br>
    *   **Exist vs. Not:** The Car is outside the gate (unseen), so it can be "Hypthetical/Provisional" (*Jiǎ Shè*). The City is on the road (needed for shelter), so it must be "Existent" (*Yǒu*).<br>
    *   **Principle vs. Teaching:** Taking Teaching to find Principle: Principle is One, so no "Three Fruits" (Car is empty). Taking Teaching to grasp Principle: The Three Teachings attain the Principle, so it exists (City).<br>
    *   **Three vs. One:**<br>
        *   **One City:** All rest in the same place (Liberation).<br>
        *   **Three Cars:** People's delights/roots differ, so Three.<br>
    *   **Moving vs. Static:**<br>
        *   **City Static:** Represents the "Extinction" aspect (Nirvana state).<br>

    *   **From Sentient Beings' Minds:** Both Existent.<br>
    *   **From Buddha's Wisdom:** Both Existent and Non-Existent.<br>
    *   **Provisional Wisdom:** Sees City as Existent (to lead). Sees Cars as Three (to suit capacities).<br>
    *   **Real Wisdom:** Sees City as Non-Existent (Magic). Sees Cars as One (One Vehicle).<br>

**2. Q/A: Transformed Cars vs. Magic City (*Huà Chē vs Huà Chéng*):**<br>
*   **Question:** What is the difference?<br>
*   **Answer:**<br>
    *   **3 Cars:** Metaphor for the **Dharma Wheel** (Sound). Children hear but don't see.<br>
    *   **Magic City:** Metaphor for the **Supernatural Power Wheel** (Form/Color).<br>
*   **Analysis:**<br>
    *   **City vs. Messengers:** Messengers (Ch 4) point the way (Teaching [1]). City rests the affliction (Result).<br>
    *   **Dynamic/Static:** Teaching moves (Methods change). City is static (Nirvana is same).<br>
    *   **Provisional/Real Dialectic:**<br>
        *   Provisional Wisdom sees City as One (Partial Truth). Real Wisdom sees City as Three (Tathagatagarbha has aspects).<br>
        *   Provisional Wisdom sees City as Static (Grey Body/Extinguished Knowledge). Real Wisdom sees City as Dynamic (Extinguishing the Magic to advance).<br>
        *   *Zhiyi's Critique:* Old [2] masters only interpreted within the Small Vehicle. This explanation uses the Great Vehicle.<br>
<br>
**3. Q/A: The Five Places Opening Three and Revealing One:**<br>
*   **Question:** In all five places opening the three and revealing the one, what differences are there?<br>
*   **Answer:** Generally there is no difference; specifically there are distinctions.<br>
    *   **Expedient Means:** By teaching; it says, “The Tathāgata only uses the one Buddha‑vehicle to teach beings; there are not two and not three.”<br>
    *   **Burning House:** By practice; the cart signifies carrying/transport, thus practice; it says, “Each rides a great cart and roams the four directions, playing in delight.”<br>
    *   **Faith Understanding:** By persons; those hired workers are the elder’s son; “We [A2] in the past were truly Buddha‑sons.”<br>
    *   **Medicinal Herbs:** By difference and non‑difference to clarify provisional and real. It does not explicitly accept or reject; it only shows that beings do not know and the Buddha lets them know. If the seven kinds of difference are known, that is provisional; if all rely on one principle without difference, that is real. Difference within non‑difference and non‑difference within difference is taught so they know this meaning; it never says there is no one or there is one. This is the Buddha’s own speech of the two wisdoms of provisional and real; thus the Buddha can know and beings cannot know. It also connects earlier and later, using knowing/not‑knowing to clarify provisional and real.<br>
*   **Magic City:** Here it is primarily by principle to open three and reveal one. The treasure place and the magic city are the two principles of small and great; it breaks the two‑vehicle transformed principle and reveals the treasure place’s true one principle.<br>
*   **Below:** In the 500 disciples’ understanding, the jewel is used as a parable [3]; this too is by principle.<br>

**2. Joining the Parable (*Hé Pì*):**<br>
**"O Bhikshus, the Tathagata" (Line 261 onwards):**<br>
This section joins the metaphors to the Dharma. It does not follow the original sequence strictly (*Bù Cì Dì*).<br>
1.  **"Tathagata is also thus":** Joins with the **Guide Metaphor** (5th).<br>
2.  **"Now for all of you":** Joins with the **Many Multitudes Metaphor** (3rd).<br>
3.  **"Knowing the dangerous difficulties of Birth, Death, and Affliction":** Joins with the **Dangerous Evil Road Metaphor** (2nd).<br>
4.  **"Long and Far":** Joins with the **500 Yojanas Metaphor** (1st).<br>
5.  **"Should go, should be crossed":** Joins with the **Clever, Wise, and Clear-Sighted** (part of Guide), and also fits "Wishing to cross the dangerous road to the Treasure."<br>

**Joining the "Leading/Conducting" (*Jiāng Dǎo*):**<br>
*   **"If sentient beings only hear":** Joins with the **Leading Metaphor**.<br>
*   **"Only hear One Buddha Vehicle":** (They become anxious/retreat). Joins with **Retreating from Great to receive Small**.<br>
*   **" If sentient beings dwell in the Two Lands":** Joins with **Extinguishing Magic to reach the Treasure**.

**Further Joining of the Second Parable (Retreating/Receiving):**<br>
The second parable originally has **retreating from the Great** and **receiving the Small**; here it is fully joined. In the retreating from the Great there are three meanings: “only hearing one Buddha‑vehicle” joins the previous mid‑road slackening (no capacity); “not wishing to see the Buddha, not wishing to hear the Dharma” joins the previous telling the guide (not accepting admonition/exhortation); “then they think thus” joins the previous inability to advance (stopping the transformation). From “the Buddha knows this mind” downward joins the previous receiving‑with‑the‑Small. The parable originally has four; here it joins only three: “the Buddha knows this mind” joins the previous “the guide has many expedients” (fitting suitability); “cowardly and inferior” joins the previous “these are pitiable” (knowing there is small capacity); from “for the sake of rest in mid‑road” downward joins the third, actually creating the conjured city—people entering the city parable; and “in mid‑road he speaks two Nirvanas” means: when three‑realm afflictions are exhausted but dust‑sand and ignorance are not yet broken, between these two pillars he distinguishes remainder and non‑remainder Nirvana, also the Nirvana of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas. Also, when fragmentary birth‑death is exhausted and transformational birth‑death not yet removed, between the two deaths he distinguishes remainder and non‑remainder; therefore it is called mid‑road (etc.). From “if sentient beings dwell in the two stages” downward joins the third, leading toward the treasure place. The text above has two; here the joining is also two: “if sentient beings dwell in the two stages” joins knowing they have rested; from “then the Tathagata immediately speaks” downward joins leading toward the treasure place. From “like that guide” downward, second, reiterating the parable to attach the joining—reiterating the receiving‑with‑the‑Small parable to join applying the Three, reiterating the extinguishing‑the‑magic parable to join revealing the One, as in the text (etc.).<br>

**“From ‘These śrāmaṇeras [3]…’”:** Twenty‑seven lines, praising the correct bonding. The prose above has two; now the first eight lines praise the **Dharma explanation**, and the next nineteen lines praise the **parable explanation**. The Dharma explanation has three: now the first three lines praise the first (former bonding causes); next one line praises the second (intermediate encounter); next four lines praise the third (today returning to speak the *Lotus*). The former bonding has four: first half‑line praises the Buddha entering samādhi; next, from “for countless …” second, one and a half lines praise the re‑explaining; later, from “each śrāmaṇera” third, one line praises hearing Dharma and benefiting—omitting the fourth (the Buddha rising from samādhi to praise). [4] Next, from “after that Buddha’s extinction [5]” the second, [6] three lines praise intermediate encounter. From “these sixteen śrāmaṇeras” the third, four lines praise today’s[7] speaking of the *Lotus*. The above text has [8] two: first, connecting ancient and modern (present and future). Now the first three lines praise connecting the present teachers and disciples. From “by these original causes and conditions” onward, second, one line praises returning to speak the *Lotus*—the prose above has three; now the first line praises the first (assembly pure): by these original causes and conditions, today’s assembly is free of difficulty and capacities arise. Next, from “now speak the *Lotus*” onward, second, three phrases praise the second (speaking this sutra), omitting the third (explaining the opening of the Three). From “dangerous evil road” onward, second, nineteen lines praise the opening and joining of the parable: first 11.5 lines praise the opening; later 7.5 lines praise the joining. The opening parable has two: now the first three lines praise the 500‑yojanas parable; the next eight and a half lines praise the leading parable. The 500‑yojanas parable has five: now the first line praises the second (dangerous evil road); next, from “countless thousands…” second, half‑line praises the third (many multitudes); next, from “the road is very…” third, half‑line praises the first (500 yojanas); next, from “there was a guide” fourth, one phrase praises the fifth (one guide); from “strongly knowing…” three phrases praise cleverness and penetration, not praising the fourth. From “the people were all weary” onward, second, eight and a half lines praise the leading parable. The prose has three; now it also praises three: the first two characters praise the first leading; from “all weary” onward, second, five lines three phrases three characters praise the second (multitudes slacken and provisionally establish the conjured city); next, from “the guide knew” onward, third, [9] two and a half lines praise the third (extinguishing the magic and leading to the treasure). The second prose has two—first slackening, second receiving; now the first three phrases three characters praise slackening, and the next five lines praise making the conjured city to receive. In the slackening portion there are three; now it omits praising the first mid‑road. In the receiving/conjuring portion it praises all: first line praises the second (lamenting loss of the Great); next, from “then thought” second, two phrases praise the first (forming the thought); next, from “conjuring a great city” third, two and a half lines praise the third (conjuring). The prose has two; now the first one and a half lines praise the actual conjuring parable. “Houses” are the realms of empty contemplation; “parks/groves” are the two‑vehicle dhāraṇī forests of non‑outflow dharmas. The nine successive samādhis are “channels”; the eight liberations are “bathing pools”; “double gates” are the three gates of emptiness and also the double‑emptiness samādhi that exhausts non‑arising wisdom, as towers rise high. “Men and women” are concentration and wisdom. In contemplative interpretation, the wisdom‑body is complete like city walls; good dharmas are full like encircling outer walls; ultimate emptiness is the houses; [10] straight good can accomplish self‑practice like men managing household affairs; compassionate external transformation is like women marrying outward. Next, from “having conjured thus” onward, second, one line praises the speaking of the conjuring. Next, from “after the people entered” onward, fourth, one line praises [11] the fourth (entering the city). From “the guide knew they had rested” onward, third, two and a half lines praise the third (extinguishing the magic and reaching the treasure). The prose has two; now the first phrase praises knowing they have rested; next, from “gathering the assembly” onward, second, two lines and one phrase praise extinguishing the magic and leading to the treasure. From “I am also like this” onward, second, seven and a half lines praise the joining of the two parables: first half‑line praises joining the first (500‑yojanas) parable; next seven lines praise joining the second (leading) parable. The joining of the 500 has four; now half‑line summarizes. “Seeing those who seek the [12] Way” two lines praise joining the slackening parable. In the opening parable, the mid‑road was not praised; now one line joins the mid‑road slackening, and the next line praises joining the receiving/conjuring. From “already knowing they have reached Nirvana” onward, second, five lines praise joining the extinguishing‑magic and leading‑to‑treasure parable. The joining prose has two; now the verse also has two: first half‑line praises knowing they have rested; next, from “then gathers the great assembly” onward, second, three and a half lines praise joining extinguishing the magic and leading to the treasure. In the extinguishing‑magic verse there is the hidden treasury of three virtues: “you will realize all‑wisdom” is prajñā; “possessing the thirty‑two marks” is dharmakāya; “that is true extinction” is liberation. The three dharmas are not vertical and not horizontal—this is seeing Buddha‑nature. From “Buddhas are guides” onward, one line praises the concluding joining.<br>

**1. Title Explanation (*Shì Wǔ Bǎi Dì Zǐ Shòu Jì Pǐn*):**
This is the **Third Cycle of Prediction** (Causes and Conditions Cycle).
*   **Why "500"?** Although 1200 disciples receive the prediction, 500 share the **Same Name** (*Dé Jì Míng Tóng*) and 500 orally express understanding. Thus, the chapter is titled "500."
*   **Context:** This is the second section of the "Causes and Conditions" narrative.
*   **Metaphorical Comparisons:**
    *   **Poor Man Parable (Ch 4):** Metaphors the **Lower Root receiving Dharma** (Understanding).
    *   **Hidden Jewel Parable (Ch 8):** Metaphors the **Lower Root receiving Grace** (Gratitude/Realization).
        *   Previously, the Poor Man received the Master's wealth (Dharma).
        *   Now, the "Jewel in the Robe" parable clarifies that one always possessed the wealth (Grace/Buddha Nature).

    *   **Purna (Mǎn Yuàn):** The foremost speaker. Handled first.
    *   **The Rest of the 1200:** Handled second.
2.  **2000 Disciples:** (Later).

**3. Purna's Section:**
*   **Sequence:** First describes his **Joy in Understanding** (*Huān Xǐ*), then describes his **Silent Thought/Understanding** (*Mò Niàn Lǐng Jiě*).

**4. Joy in Understanding — Detailed Analysis:**<br>
*   **Two Parts:** (1) Causes of understanding; (2) The joy of understanding.<br>
*   **Causes of Understanding (Four):**<br>
    1.  **Hearing the Dharma Parable:** The two cycles opened the Three and revealed the One.<br>
    2.  **Receiving predictions for Sariputra and the five great disciples.**<br>
    3.  **Hearing the past-life bonding events.**<br>
    4.  **Hearing the Buddhas' Three Reaches, unobstructed.**<br>
*   **Seeing the Distant Past as Today:** This is the power of **Great自在神通** (great self-mastery spiritual power), refuting the Two Vehicles' limit of only 80,000 kalpas.<br>
*   **Phrase Mapping (Opening/ Revealing):**<br>
    *   **"From the Buddha hearing this wisdom":** Understands **revealing the real** in *Expedient Means* and *Burning House*.<br>
    *   **"Expediently spoken according to suitability":** Understands **opening the provisional** in those two places.<br>
    *   **"Great disciples":** Understands **opening the provisional**.<br>
    *   **"Bestowing bodhi predictions":** Understands **revealing the real**.<br>
    *   **"Past-life causes/conditions":** Understands **revealing the real**.<br>
    *   **"Supernatural power":** Understands **opening the provisional**.<br>
*   **From “Attaining what has never been” onward:** Explains the joy of understanding—first **inner joy**, then **outer reverence**.<br>
    *   **"Never had":** Formerly they had not heard Opening-Provisional/ Revealing-Real; now they have.<br>
    *   **"Mind pure":** Removing Nirvana-attachment and breaking distinct delusions.<br>
    *   **"Leaping with joy":** Opening Buddha knowledge/vision.<br>
    *   **"Reverence":** Understanding arises from the Buddha, hence reverence [1].<br>
*   **Root/Trace View:** If read as Root/Trace, this is celebrating those who practice the Real.<br>

**5. Silent Understanding — Detailed Analysis:**<br>
*   **Two Parts:** (1) Silent understanding; (2) Silent request to reveal traces and ask for prediction.<br>
*   **Why Silent Now?** In the first two cycles, they spoke to encourage lower roots who had not yet awakened. Now lower roots have awakened, so there is no need to encourage. Earlier they only understood and did not ask to reveal traces; now they both understand and ask, and remain silent to avoid criticism—thus silent understanding is appropriate.<br>
*   **Great Understanding:** Silent understanding is a **great understanding**, like *Vimalakirti*—silence is true entry into the non-dual Dharma gate.<br>
*   **Provisional/Real Inconceivable:** It is neither speech nor thought, yet they speak and think. Earlier they spoke to express understanding; now they silently understand.<br>
*   **Why not request revealing traces earlier?** Because lower roots had not yet awakened. Now lower roots have understood and the provisional teaching has completed its function. If lower roots revealed traces, then the middle/upper would also be provisional; by middle/upper standards, that would not be fitting for the lower.<br>
*   **Phrase Explanations:**<br>
    *   **"World-Honored One’s deeds are rare":** Understanding the **Real Wisdom**.<br>
    *   **"Following worldly kinds of nature and speaking Dharma":** Understanding the **Provisional Wisdom**—the seven expedient roots. This receives the Opening-Provisional/ Revealing-Real meaning in the *Expedient Means* chapter.<br>
    *   **"Pulling beings out of attachments everywhere":** Receives the Opening-Provisional/ Revealing-Real in the *Burning House* chapter.<br>
    *   **"We cannot proclaim the Buddha’s merits":** Receives the *Medicinal Herbs* teaching that the Tathagata has immeasurable merits beyond them. Since they cannot proclaim it in words, it is also beyond thought.<br>
*   **"Only the Buddha can know":** This is the **silent request** to reveal traces and ask for prediction.<br>
    *   **"We":** A general silent request for all to reveal traces.<br>
    *   **"Deep mind":** Root and present; now manifest as traces.<br>
    *   **"Original vow":** The great compassion vow—compassionate descent to teach is the vow; seeking Buddhahood is the vow. Requesting the upward seeking is asking for prediction; requesting the downward teaching is asking for revealing traces.<br>
    *   **Result:** From deep mind they show assistance to the Buddha across three times; from the original vow they are thus given prediction.<br>
*   **Reasons for Joy:**
    1.  Heard the **Parable** (Ch 7) opening the Three to reveal One.
    2.  Saw the **5 Great Disciples** receive prediction.
    3.  Heard the **Past Life Bonding** matters.
    4.  Heard the **Buddha's Unobstructed Wisdom** (Three Reaches).
*   **"And he thought to himself" (Line 300):** This is the Correct Explanation of Silent Understanding.
    *   *Question:* In previous cycles, disciples spoke. Why silent here?
    *   *Answer:* Previous cycles Lower Root hadn't awakened, needed encouraging speech. Now they are awakened. Also, avoiding redundancy and mockery. "Understanding so I think; avoiding mockery so I am silent."
    *   *Comparison:* Like Vimalakirti's Silence being the true entry into Non-Duality. This is "Great Understanding."

**3. The Logic of Silent Understanding (*Mò Niàn*):**<br>
**"And he thought to himself" (Line 300):**<br>
*   **Question:** In the previous two cycles (Voice Hearers, Middle Root), they all spoke aloud. Why is Purna silent here?<br>
*   **Answer:**<br>
    1.  **Function:** Previously, the Lower Root had not engaged/awakened, so speech was needed to encourage/move them (*Quàn Dòng*). Now, the Lower Root has already awakened. No need to encourage. Thus, silent.<br>
    2.  **Modesty:** Previously, they admitted fault (Lost Son) but didn't explicitly ask for the "Traces to be Revealed" (Bodhisattva deeds). But now, he both understands and wants to request the Trace. "Understanding so I think; avoiding mockery so I am silent." Silent thought is appropriate (*Mò Niàn Yǔn Yí*).<br>
    3.  **Doctrinal Depth:** "Silent Understanding is the Great Understanding." Just as in the *Vimalakirti Sutra* (*Jìng Míng*), **Silence is the true entry into the Non-Dual Dharma Gate.**<br>
    4.  **Inconceivable:** The Provisional and Real are inconceivable. Non-speaking yet speaking; speaking yet non-speaking. Today, he uses "Silent Thought."<br>
*   **Why not request Trace verbally?**<br>
    *   For the sake of the Lower Root who has not yet awakened, one does not Request Trace. Now the Lower Root has understood, the expedient matter is sufficient. If the Lower Root requested the Trace, then [people would know] the Middle/Upper were also provisional; if regarding Upper/Middle, then for the Lower it is not convenient.<br>
*   **Interpreting the Silent Thoughts:**<br>
    *   **"World Honored One Very Rare":** Receives/Understands the **Real Wisdom**.<br>
    *   **"Following Worldly Species":** Receives/Understands the **Provisional Wisdom** (Seven Expedients roots).<br>
    *   **"Pulling out attachment":** Receives the **Opening Provisional / Revealing Real** of *Burning House*.<br>
    *   **"Cannot Declared by Words":** Understanding *Medicinal Herbs*—Buddha's merit cannot be reached by words or thought.<br>
    *   **"Only Buddha Can Know":** This is the **Silent Request for Trace/Prediction**. "We" implies requesting for all.<br>
    *   **"Deep Mind":** This is the Origin/Present. Present act is the Trace.<br>
    *   **"Original Vow":** Great Compassion Vow. Great Compassion downwardly saves, thus "Vow." Upwardly seeking Buddhahood, thus "Wish." Asking for Upward Seeking is Requesting Prediction. Asking for Downward Saving is Requesting Revealing Trace.<br>

**3. Verse Analysis (*Jì Sòng*):**
There are **49 and a half lines** of verse relating to the above.
**A. Praise of the Cause (`22.5 Lines`):**
*   **First 12 Lines:** Praise the **Far Cause** (*Yuǎn Yóu*). (Great Universal Buddha, Princes appearing).
    *   **First 3 Lines:** Praise **Matters Before Attaining the Way**.
    *   **Next 1 Line:** Praise **Correctly Attaining the Way** (Passed 10 small kalpas).

**"The Buddha told" (Line 302):**<br>
The Buddha narrates and bestows the prediction (*Shù Ér Jì Zhī*). This has Prose and Verse. The Prose has two parts: 1. Narrating Origin and Traces (*Shù Běn Jī*), 2. Bestowing Prediction (*Yǔ Shòu Jì*).<br>
**Narrating Origin and Traces (3 Parts):**<br>
1.  **Shakyamuni's Age:** Revealing Traces through Causal Practice (*Xíng Yīn Fā Jī*).<br>
2.  **Past Buddhas' Age:** Revealing the Origin through Causal Practice (*Xíng Yīn Xiǎn Běn*).<br>
3.  **Three Periods:** Fulfilling the Causal Practice of Buddhas of the Three Times (*Xiū Yīn Xíng Mǎn*).<br>
<br>
**1. Shakyamuni's Age (Revealing Traces):**<br>
*   **"Do you see?" (*Rǔ Děng Jiàn Fǒu*):** Two meanings:<br>
    1.  Do you see his **Trace** acts as "Small" (Sravaka)?<br>
    2.  Do you see his **Origin** Merit (Bodhisattva)?<br>
    *   *The Crowd:* Only sees the Trace (Sravaka), cannot know the Origin.<br>
*   **"I always praise him" (*Wǒ Cháng Chēng Qí*):** Marks the **Trace** (*Biāo Qí Jī*).<br>
    *   In the Trace, he is "Number One Preacher of Dharma."<br>
    *   *Insight:* If not for the **Subtle Origin of the Dharma Body** (*Fǎ Shēn Miào Běn*), he could not manifest the Supreme Trace.<br>
    *   Previously, he was called "#1 Preacher" (Small). Now, we see he has been "#1 in the Supreme Dharma" for a long time. This is **Raising the Trace to Reveal the Origin**.<br>
*   **"Also always admire him" (*Yì Cháng Tàn Qí*):** Marks the **Origin Ground** (*Biāo Qí Běn Dì*).<br>
    *   "Various Merits" = Ten Thousand Practices of Blessings and Wisdom.<br>
    *   If the Origin has "Various Merits," why is the Trace only a Two Vehicle? This **Raises the Origin to Clarify the Trace**.<br>
*   **"Diligently Protects and Upholds" (*Jīng Qín Hù Chí*):** Detailed Explanation [2].<br>
    *   **"Helping Proclaim My Dharma" (*Zhù Xuān Wǒ Fǎ*):** This refers to helping proclaim the **Half and Full Teachings** (*Bàn Mǎn*) within the Traces.<br>
    *   **Five Flavors Mapping:**<br>
        1.  **Trace as Sravaka:** Helps proclaim the **Dairy Dharma** (*Lào Fǎ*) (Avatamsaka/Agamas).<br>
        2.  **Trace in Vaipulya (Scolded):** Helps proclaim the **Cream/Curds Dharma** (*Shēng Sū Fǎ*). (Vimalakirti scolding).<br>
        3.  **Trace leading Prajna:** Helps proclaim the **Butter/Cheese Dharma** (*Shú Sū Fǎ*). (Subhuti teaching Prajna).<br>
        4.  **Trace enlightenment in Lotus:** Helps proclaim the **Ghee Dharma** (*Tí Hú Fǎ*).<br>
    *   **Meaning:** He possesses the full Merit of Provisional and Real (Origin), yet manifests the Five Flavors in the Traces to help the Buddha tune and ripen beings.<br>
    *   **"Able to show/teach the Four Assemblies":** Distinguishing the **Half-Word Teaching**.<br>
    *   **"Fully Explain":** Helping proclaim the **Full-Word Prajna Teaching**.<br>
    *   **"Self-discarding the Tathagata":** Aside from the Tathagata (who knows), no one else knows his depth. "Self-discarding" implies descending from the level of Subtle Enlightenment.

<div class="english-translation">
**2. Past Buddhas' Age (Revealing Origin) (*Jiù Guò Qù Fó Shì Xiǎn Qí Běn Xíng*):**<br>
**"Do not say [he only] helps proclaim My Dharma" (Line 306):**<br>
*   Not only helping Me (Shakyamuni) proclaim Half/Full teachings, but also helped in the **Far Distant Past**.<br>
*   **Trace vs. Origin:** Today's helping = **Revealing Trace** (*Fā Jī*). Past helping = **Revealing Origin** (*Xiǎn Běn*).<br>
*   **Two Origins:**<br>
    1.  **Far Origin (*Yuǎn Běn*):** Mysterious and distant, hard to believe. Omitted.<br>
    2.  **Near Origin (*Jìn Běn*):** **90 Billion Buddhas**. Mentioned because those with Past-Life Knowledge can verify it. Uses "Near" to prove "Far."<br>
*   **Five Flavors in the Past:**<br>
    *   Even under those 90 Billion Buddhas, he helped proclaim the Five Flavors:<br>
    *   **"Protects and Helps Proclaim":** Corresponds to **Half-Word / Dairy Dharma**.<br>
    *   **"Buddha's True Dharma":** Corresponds to **Vaipulya / Cream Dharma**.<br>
    *   **"Clear Understanding of Emptiness Dharma":** Corresponds to **Butter / Prajna Dharma**. (Just as Subhuti turns the wheel of Prajna today).<br>
    *   **"Transforming Limitless Beings to Establish Bodhi":** Corresponds to **Ghee / Lotus Dharma**.<br>
    *   *Note:* In those past times, people also thought he was just a Sravaka.<br>
<br>
**3. Three Compounds/Periods (Fulfilling Practice):**<br>
**"Also under the Seven Buddhas" (Line 311):**<br>
Refers to the **Three Periods** (Past 90 Billion, Recent Past 7 Buddhas, Present).<br>
*   It illustrates that throughout all these times, he has been helping proclaim the Half and Full, Five Flavor Dharmas to benefit beings both Small and Great.<br>
