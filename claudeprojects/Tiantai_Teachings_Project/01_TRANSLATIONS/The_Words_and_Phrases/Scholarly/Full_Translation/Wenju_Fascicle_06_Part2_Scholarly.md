### 1. Father and Son Seeing Each Other (Lines 207-220)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「爾時窮子傭賃」下，第二父子相見譬，近領火宅中見火，遠領方便中五濁意。為三：一、明窮子傭賃，領火宅所見之火，法說所見五濁；二、父見子，領火宅長者見，法說中佛眼見也；三、歡喜適願，領火宅中驚怖，法說中起大悲心...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**"At that time the Poor Son, hiring himself out..."**<br>
This is the second part: **Father and Son Seeing Each Other**.<br>
*   **Near Match:** Matches "Seeing the Fire" in the Burning House Parable.<br>
*   **Far Match:** Matches "Five Turbidities" in Expedient Means Chapter.<br>
**Three Sections:**<br>
1.  **Poor Son Hiring Out:** Matches "Seen Fire" (and "Seen 5 Turbidities").<br>
2.  **Father Seeing Son:** Matches "Elder Seeing" (and "Buddha Eye Seeing").<br>
3.  **Rejoicing/Suiting Wish:** Matches "Alarm/Fear" (and "Great Compassion Arising").<br>
*(Burning House: Fear from seeing suffering. Here: Joy from seeing capacity—matched by paradox.)*<br>
**Order of Seeing:**<br>
*   **Buddha's Side:** Spirit Wisdom knows first; Response follows. So "Father sees Son first."<br>
*   **Being's Side:** Capacity (*Jī*) must occur before Response. So "Son sees Father first."<br>
*   **Ultimate Reality:** Neither before nor after (Inconceivable). Text alternates.<br>
**Textual Division (Two Parts):**<br>
1.  **Son Sees Father (4 Aspects):**<br>
    *   *Cause:* Seeking Clothing/Food.<br>
    *   *Place:* By the Gate/Door.<br>
    *   *Mark/Appearance:* Squatting on Lion Seat.<br>
    *   *Reaction:* Fear/Avoidance ("Regret coming here").<br>
2.  **Father Sees Son (4 Aspects):**<br>
    *   *Place:* Lion Seat.<br>
    *   *Recognition:* Knew him immediately.<br>
    *   *Emotion:* Great Joy.<br>
    *   *Intent:* Suiting the Wish (Treasury has someone to entrust to).
</div>
</div>

### 2. Analysis of the Son Seeing the Father (Lines 213-219)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
見父之由，由厭苦欣樂推求理味，漸漸積習，遂成出世善根... 父喻道後法身，舍喻無[5]緣慈悲... 「遙見其父」... 「踞師子床」者，圓報法身安處空理... 「婆羅門」... 「真珠瓔珞」... 「吏民僮僕」... 「白拂」... 「覆以寶帳」... 「威德特尊」...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**1. Cause of Seeing:** Disliking suffering, seeking logic/taste (*Lǐ Wèi*). Gradually accumulated Good Roots.<br>
**2. Place (The Gate):**<br>
*   **"Father":** Post-Way Dharma Body (*Dào Hòu Fǎ Shēn*).<br>
*   **"House":** Unconditioned Compassion.<br>
*   **"Remote" (*Yáo*):** Great Capacity is distant; Response is subtle. Thus "Remote."<br>
*   **"By the Gate":** (Small Capacity). Two Views (Side) vs. Middle Way (Center Gate). Sravakas use Partial Truth (*Piān Zhēn*), essentially peeking at the Dharma Body from the side.<br>
**3. Marks of the Father (The Reward Body / *Rocana*):**<br>
*   **"Squatting on Lion Seat":** Resting in First Principle Emptiness. Fearless.<br>
*   **"Jeweled Bench" (*Bǎo Jī*):** Real Truth (*Shí Dì*) supporting the Feet (Samadhi/Wisdom).<br>
*   **"Brahmins":** 8th Stage Bodhisattvas (Pure Conduct).<br>
*   **"Kshatriyas":** 7th Stage and below (Ruling Class).<br>
*   **"Householders":** Inner Ordinary Ranks.<br>
    *(This indicates a Reward Body surrounded by Great Bodhisattvas, not merely a Transformed Body.)*<br>
*   **"Pearl Necklaces":** Four Paramitas / Four Dhaāraṇīs.<br>
*   **"Clerks/Citizens":** Those asserting Expedient Teachings (breaking obstacles).<br>
*   **"White Whisk":** Function of Expedient Wisdom (Brushing away dust). Right = Empty; Left = Provisional.<br>
*   **"Jeweled Curtains":** True Compassion covering all.<br>
*   **"Fragrant Water sprinkling":** Dharma Water settling the dust of illusions.<br>
*   **"Scattered Flowers":** Seven Limbs of Enlightenment / Three Precepts.<br>
*   **"Took off Necklaces... Put on Dirty Clothes":** This proves the *Nirmanakaya* (Dirty Clothes) is worn by the *Sambhogakaya* (Rich Man). He holds the "Dung Vessel" (Expedient Method) to approach the son.
</div>
</div>



### 3. Sending the Person to Chase him (Lines 221-229)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「即遣傍人急追將還」下，第三明追誘譬，近領火宅捨几用車，遠領法說寢大施小。此文為二：初、遣傍人追，次、遣二人誘... 火宅長行，誡、勸、釋各有三，今則併領。「即遣傍人疾走往捉」，領上勸門之擬宜；「窮子驚愕」，領上勸門之無機；「強牽將還」，領上誡門之擬宜；「窮子自念無罪」至「悶絕躃地」，領上誡門之無機...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**"Immediately sent a bystander to chase and catch him..."**<br>
This is Part 3: **Chasing and Luring**.<br>
*   **Near Match:** Discarding the Bench to Use Carts (Admonition/Encouragement).<br>
*   **Far Match:** Ceasing the Great to Bestow the Small.<br>
**Structure:**<br>
1.  **Chasing (*Zhuī*) with a Bystander:** Represents the attempt to use the Great Vehicle (Encouragement/Admonition).<br>
2.  **Luring (*Yòu*) with Two Men:** Represents the switch to the Small Vehicle.<br>
**Interpretation of the Chase:**<br>
*   **"Sent Bystander / Ran Fast / Caught Him":** Matches "Encouragement" (*Quàn*). Using the Direct Great Vehicle to approach the capacity.<br>
*   **"Son Surprised/Alarmed":** Matches "No Capacity" for Encouragement.<br>
*   **"Forcibly Dragging Back":** Matches "Admonition" (*Jiè*). Using Fear/Hell to warn against evil.<br>
*   **"No Sin / Fainted":** Matches "No Capacity" for Admonition. (Sravakas think they have no sin because they don't value Compassion. Dragging them into "Birth and Death" to save others feels like prison to them).<br>
**Who is the Bystander?**<br>
*   **Teaching:** The **Teachings** (*Jiào*). Truth is Right/Central; Teaching is "By the Side" (*Bàng*).<br>
*   **Person:** **Dharma Body Bodhisattvas** (*Fǎ Shēn Púsà*). Like 40th Stage Bodhisattvas preaching in *Avatamsaka*. Because the Son (Two Vehicles) cannot handle them, they are "Side People."<br>
**Son's Reaction:**<br>
*   **"Crying out in resentment":** Small Vehicle treats Affliction as an enemy. "Affliction is Bodhi" sounds like slander/abuse to them.<br>
*   **"I have no sin/offense":** I am not seeking the Great Way, why force me? I lack Great Compassion, but that is not a "Crime" in my view.<br>
*   **"Fainted and Fell" (*Mèn Jué Bì Dì*):** Strong Great Teaching caused confusion (Fainted) and Slander/Falling into Evil Paths (Fell to Earth).
</div>
</div>

### 4. The Father's Strategy (Lines 229-236)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
從「父遙見」下，即是第三，放捨勸誡息大乘化。就此為四：一、思惟息化，二、釋息化，三、正息化，四、息化得宜... 「父遙見」者，小去大遠故名為遙... 「而語使言」者，約教... 約人... 「勿強將來」... 「冷水灑面」...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**"The Father saw from afar...":**<br>
This is **Ceasing the Great Vehicle Teaching** (*Xī Dà Chéng Huà*).<br>
1.  **Contemplating Ceasing:**<br>
    *   **"Do not force him":** Knows the Great Will is weak. Forcing will destroy Good Roots.<br>
    *   **"Speak to the Messenger":** Tells the Bodhisattvas/Great Teaching to stop.<br>
    *   **"Don't need this person":** Stops the Encouragement.<br>
    *   **"Do not force":** Stops the Admonition.<br>
2.  **Using Cold Water:**<br>
    *   **"Cold Water sprinkled on face":** Using the "Water of Principle" (Ash-Body/Extinction) to cool the "Heat of Views/Thoughts" (*Jiàn Sī Rè*).<br>
    *   **"Face":** Turning away from Samsara (Back) and facing Nirvana (Face).<br>
    *   **"Wake up":** Waking from the confusion of the Great Teaching to understand the Four Noble Truths.<br>
3.  **Explanation:** Why stop? Because his will is low/inferior. But the Buddha's intent is not finished ("Wait for later period").<br>
4.  **Proper Ceasing:** "I now let you go." (Releasing form the Great).<br>
5.  **Son Rejoicing:** "Rose from the ground." (Escaped fear of Great/Hell; aroused Small Good Roots).
</div>
</div>

### 5. Secretly Sending Two Men (Lines 240-250)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「將欲誘引」下，是密遣二人誘引... 「密遣二人」者，四弟子齊己分領，不涉菩薩，故言二人。約法是因緣四諦，約理是有作真俗，約人是聲聞緣覺... 「形色憔悴」... 「汝可詣彼」... 「倍與汝直」... 「雇汝除糞」...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**"Secretly Sent Two Men" (*Mì Qiǎn Èr Rén*):**<br>
*   **"Secretly" (*Mì*):** Hiding the Real, Showing the Expedient.<br>
*   **"Two Men":**<br>
    *   *Law:* Four Truths and Twelve Causes.<br>
    *   *Principle:* Created (*Yǒu Zuò*) Real and Mundane Truths.<br>
    *   *Person:* **Sravakas and Pratyekabuddhas**.<br>
*   **"Haggard Appearance" (*Xíng Sè Qiáo Cuì*):** Bodhisattvas hiding their True Form/Marks (32 Marks) to appear as Sravakas (No marks, merely discussing Suffering/Imperminence).<br>
*   **"Softly Speak" (*Xú Yǔ*):** Small Teaching is circuitous/slow, unlike the "Fast Run" of the Great.<br>
*   **"Double the Wages":**<br>
    *   *Old Way (5 Precepts):* Escapes 3 Evil Paths (One wage).<br>
    *   *New Way (4 Truths):* Escapes All Samsara (Double wage). Or: Outer Paths suppress defilements (1x); This cuts defilements (2x).<br>
*   **"Working / Removing Dung":** Removing Sufferings (Dung) to get Nirvana (Price).<br>
*   **"We Two will work with you":**<br>
    *   *Meaning:* The Expedient Person (Manifestation Body) works alongside the Real Person. Or Wisdom and Truth aiding each other.<br>
**"Father saw the Son, Pity and Wonder":**<br>
*   **Pity (*Mǐn*):** For taking the Small Fruit (Arhatship).<br>
*   **Wonder/Blame (*Guài*):** That he doesn't seek the Great Way. Loss is huge, gain is small.<br>
**"Another Day" (*Tā Rì*):**<br>
*   **Refrospective Interpretation:** The text says "Another Day" not to mean a literal time sequence, but "Another Mode of Wisdom" (Expedient Wisdom vs Real Wisdom). The Buddha's Wisdom (Day/Sun) shines through the "Window" (Partial View) to see the Son.<br>
*   **"Took off Necklaces... Put on Dirty Clothes":** This proves the *Nirmanakaya* (Dirty Clothes) is worn by the *Sambhogakaya* (Rich Man). He holds the "Dung Vessel" (Expedient Method) to approach the son.

## VII. DETAILED PARABLE: PART 3 - HOUSE MANAGEMENT (Lines 251-280; CBETA 006:251–280)

### 1. The Strategy of Employment (Lines 251-266)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
今初語諸作人者，即是說三藏示四念處，是除糞之器，斷結之境故... (Lines 251-256) 「咄男子」... 「汝常此作勿復餘去」... 「當加汝價」... 「好自安意」... 「我老汝少」... 「自今已後如所生子」... 第六，「即時長者更與作字名之為兒」... 「爾時窮子雖欣此遇」下，第七，常令傭作譬... 「由是之故二十年中常令除糞」...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**"Speaking to the Workers":**<br>
Speaking the **Tripitaka** teaching, showing the **Four Foundations of Mindfulness** (*Sì Niàn Chù*) as the "Tool for Removing Dung" (cutting off bonds).<br>
*   **"Do not slack off":** Exerting effort in the Four Right Efforts (*Sì Zhèng Qín*).<br>
*   **"Hey Man!" (*Duō Nán Zǐ*):**<br>
    *   *Duō:* Shock/Scolding. (Mindfulness is "Male/Yang"; Samadhi is "Female/Yin"). Since Efforts are active/scattered, he scolds them to enter stillness (Samadhi - Four Steps to Power).<br>
*   **"Work here constantly, don't go elsewhere":** Focus on Samadhi (Four Ru Yi Zu) without distraction. This is the **Warmth Stage** (*Nuǎn Wèi*).<br>
*   **"Increase your Wages":** In the Warmth stage, one cannot yet generate true non-outflow wisdom. In the **Summit Stage** (*Dǐng Wèi*), non-outflow wisdom can arise, hence "Increased Wages."<br>
*   **"Good, rest your mind":** **Five Roots** (*Wǔ Gēn*) are stable/safe. This is the **Patience Stage** (*Rěn Wèi*).<br>
*   **"I am old, you are young":**<br>
    *   *Old:* Buddha has completed Wisdom/Cutting.<br>
    *   *Young:* Disciple is just beginning. This is the **Worldly First Dharma Stage** (*Shì Dì Yī Fǎ*).<br>
*   **"No Five Faults":** Attaining **Five Powers** (*Wǔ Lì*) eliminates 5 faults (Deceit, Laziness, Anger, Resentment, Grudge).<br>
*   **"Like my own born son":** At the moment of the Unimpeded Path (*Wú Ài Dào*), adjoining the Truth, named "Like a Son."<br>
*   **"Gave him a name, called him Son":** Entering the Path of Seeing (*Jiàn Dào*), becoming a True Son of the Buddha (Stream-Enterer, etc.).<br>
**"Although the Poor Son rejoiced... still called himself a hired hand":**<br>
Even though he is a "Son" (Sravaka), he thinks his job is just to cut off suffering (Dung), not to inherit the family business (Buddha Knowledge).<br>
**"20 Years of Removing Dung":**<br>
1.  **Time:** The period of 20 years represents the "Deer Park" period?<br>
2.  **Meaning:**<br>
    *   *View/Thought:* Cutting View Defilements (1) + Thought Defilements (9) = 10? No.<br>
    *   *Tiantai View:* **Two Paths:** Path of Seeing + Path of Cultivation = 20.<br>
    *   *Or:* 5 Lower Bonds + 5 Upper Bonds x 2 = 20.<br>
    *   *Or:* Working with the "Two Men" (Sravaka/Pratyeka) to cut remaining bonds.<br>
    *   *Or:* **From the time of feeling the capacity** to the time of "Entrusting," approximately 20 years (Agama Period).
</div>

### 2. Entrusting the Family Business (Lines 257-266)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">

</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**From "After this..." (*Guò Shì Yǐ Hòu*):**<br>
This is Part 4: **Managing/Knowing the Family Business**.<br>
*   **Near Match:** Bestowing the Great Cart.<br>
*   **Far Match:** The Unsurpassed Way.<br>
**The Five Flavors (*Wǔ Wèi*):**<br>
Tiantai connects the flow of the Parable to the Five Flavors of Teaching:<br>
1.  **Milk (*Rǔ*) / Avatamsaka:** "Sent a Bystander to Chase." (Great Teaching rejected).<br>
2.  **Cream (*Lào*) / Agamas:** "Sent Two Men to Lure." (Deer Park, 3 Vehicles). "Removing Dung" (Cutting Defilements).<br>
3.  **Raw Curds (*Shēng Sū*) / Vaipulya:** "Mutual Trust / Coming and Going without difficulty." Hearing the Great (Net-Man / Vimalakirti) scold the Small, but not getting angry ("No Difficulty").<br>
4.  **Cooked Curds (*Shú Sū*) / Prajna:** "Managing the Household Business." The Father commands the Son to manage the Gold/Silver (Prajna Wisdom) but the Son takes none for himself. (Transmitting the Great teachings while remaining an Arhat).<br>
5.  **Ghee (*Tí Hú*) / Lotus & Nirvana:** "Bequeathing the Estate." (You are my Son, all this is yours).<br>
**"Mutual Trust" (*Xīn Xiāng Tǐ Xìn*):**<br>
*   The Son trusts the Father (Mahayana is not false).<br>
*   The Father trusts the Son (He has cut defilements and looks like a Bodhisattva).<br>
*   **"Coming and Going without difficulty":** Sravakas can listen to Mahayana (In) and return to Sravaka practice (Out) without contradiction.

### 3. Managing the Warehouse (Lines 266-280)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
領家業[7]文為二... 「然其所止猶在本處」者，雖復入出無難得聞大乘，而謂是菩薩之事非己智分，不肯迴小向大，猶居羅漢... 「語窮子言我今多有」下，第二，命知家事。「金」即別教理，「銀」即通教理... 「倉」是定門... 「庫」是慧門... 「其中多少」者，說於般若，則有廣、略二門... 「我心如是」下... 誡令體我心... 「今我與汝便為不異」...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**"However, he still lived in the original place":**<br>
Although he managed the Gold/Silver, he still lived in the Hired Hand's hut. Meaning: He understood the Mahayana Emptiness (*Prajna*), but considered it "Bodhisattva Business," not his own share. He remained an Arhat.<br>
**"Knowing the Family Business":**<br>
*   **Gold:** Separate Teaching Principle (*Bié Jiào*).<br>
*   **Silver:** Pervasive Teaching Principle (*Tōng Jiào*).<br>
    *(Gold/Silver in Prajna represents the Two Truths.)*<br>
*   **Granary:** Samadhi Gate (108 Samadhis).<br>
*   **Treasury:** Wisdom Gate (18 Emptinesses).<br>
*   **"Abundance/Overflowing":** Internal Fullness / External Teaching.<br>
*   **"Amount (Much/Little)":** Broad and Brief explanations of Prajna.<br>
**"My Mind is like this":**<br>
The Buddha commands the Sravaka (Subhuti) to teach Prajna. "Understand my mind" means "Understand that My Mind = Emptiness. You Teach Emptiness. Therefore, your teaching = My Mind."<br>
*   **"You and I are not different":**<br>
    1.  *Empowerment:* You speak by my power.<br>
    2.  *Principle:* Subhuti's 'Suchness' and Tathagata's 'Suchness' are One.<br>
    3.  *Hidden Meaning:* We are Father and Son (though you don't know it yet).<br>
**"Short Time Later":**<br>
Between the *Prajna* assembly and the *Lotus* assembly. The Son's mind gradually broadened (*Tōng Tài*), realizing the "Original Intention" was to lead to the One Vehicle.

**"Called the Son... and gathered Kinsmen":**<br>
*   **Gathering the Assembly:** The multitudes from the 20,000 Widespread Buddhas (Great Capacity) gather like clouds from the 10 directions.<br>
*   **"Kinsmen" (*Qīn Zú*):**<br>
    *   *Old Interpretation:* Transformation Bodies = Kinsmen; Kings = 10th Stage; Ministers = 9th Stage. (Tiantai rejects this: Manjusri/Maitreya etc. were present, no need to wait for Transformation Bodies).<br>
    *   *Tiantai Interpretation:* **Dharma Body Bodhisattvas** (Simultaneous/Shadow Bodhisattvas) are the Kinsmen. They are the Buddha's "Uncles" and "Cousins" in practice.<br>
    *   *King:* The Sutra (The Truth) is the King.<br>
**"Gentlemen, you should know... This is my Son":**<br>
*   **Connecting Father and Son:** "Originally received my teaching really is my son."<br>

**"Poor Son hearing this... Great Joy":**<br>
Matches the "Unprecedented" (*Wèi Céng Yǒu*) feeling. Not seeking, yet self-obtained.<br>
**Matching the Parable (Lines 294-312):**<br>
The text matches the Parable sections (Lost, Found, Hired, Manager, Heir) to the Teaching Career (Avatamsaka, Agamas, Vaipulya, Prajna, Lotus).

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">

</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**[Private Note] The World Honored One's Great Kindness:**<br>
1.  **Chamber of Tathagata:** First establishing Compassion, saving from 6 Paths, entering Great Vows. (Sheltering Kindness).<br>
