### 1. Father and Son Seeing Each Other (Lines 207-220)

[3]「爾時窮子傭賃」下，第二父子相見譬，近領火宅中見火，遠領方便中五濁意。為三：一、明窮子傭賃，領火宅所見之火，法說所見五濁；二、父見子，領火宅長者見，法說中佛眼見也；三、歡喜適願，領火宅中驚怖，法說中起大悲心。法譬並明父前見子，此中明子前見父。就佛則靈智先知，機後起應，故言父先見子；若約眾生，必先機而後應，故言子先見父。機應不可思議，不後不前，故前後互舉也。今取文便但為二段：一、子見父，二、父見子。此兩段中各復為四。初子見父四者：一、見父之由，由求衣食；二、見父之處，處在門側；三、見父[4]之相，踞師子床；四、生畏避，悔來至此。

Below “At that time the poor son hires himself out,” this is the second parable of father and son seeing each other: near it receives the burning‑house’s seeing‑the‑fire[^3], far it receives the intent of the five turbidities[^2] in expedient means[^1]. It is three: (1) it clarifies the poor son hiring himself out, receiving the burning‑house’s seen fire, and, in the Dharma exposition, the seen five turbidities; (2) the father sees the son, receiving the burning‑house elder’s seeing, and, in the Dharma exposition, the Buddha‑eye seeing[^4]; (3) joy suiting the wish, receiving in the burning‑house the alarm and fear, and, in the Dharma exposition, the arousing of great compassion[^5]. The Dharma and parable both clarify that the father sees the son first; here it clarifies that the son sees the father first. With respect to the Buddha, numinous wisdom knows first and capacity later gives rise to response, therefore it says the father first sees the son; if in terms of beings, the capacity must first and then response, therefore it says the son first sees the father. Capacity and response[^6] are inconceivable, neither after nor before, therefore the before and after are raised mutually. Now, taking the convenience of the text, it is only two sections: (1) the son sees the father, (2) the father sees the son. In these two sections each again has four. The four of the son seeing the father are: (1) the cause of seeing the father, due to seeking clothing and food; (2) the place of seeing the father, located at the side of the gate; (3) the appearance of seeing the father [4], squatting on a lion seat[^7]; (4) giving rise to fear and avoidance, regretting coming here.

見父之由，由厭苦欣樂推求理味，漸漸積習，遂成出世善根，故言「傭賃展轉」。以此善根能扣佛慈悲，故言「遇到父舍」。父喻道後法身，舍喻無[5]緣慈悲。大小二機雙扣此舍，有大機故，故言「遙見其父」，有小機故「住在門側」。若唯小無大則應不見[6]尊特之身，父不應言「我財物庫藏今有所付」；若唯大無小，不應住立門側，子不應言「非我傭力得物之處」也。見父之處者即是門側，二觀為方便即門二邊，圓中之機當門正見，二乘偏真故言門側，但空三昧偏真慧眼，傍窺法身耳。「遙見其父」，正見有二種，一近見、二遠見，今言大機始發扣召事遠，是故言「遙」；又機微非應赴，名之為「遙」也。「踞師子床」者，圓報法身安處空理，無復通別二惑、八魔等畏，故[7]云踞師子床也。《華嚴》說第一義空，四無所畏為床也。「寶几承足」者，定慧為足，實諦為几，無生定慧依真如境也。「婆羅門」，舊云，高良大姓，八地已上也。「剎利」者，七地已還也。「居士」，內凡夫等。舊云，此經中明法身，非常住法身也，乃是他方應身將應此土，即為此間之法身，故有內凡諸人圍遶。今謂不爾，若作他方佛者，子父機應體用著脫，皆不成，如前說。又不容小機扣此、大機扣彼，亦不應結大緣於彼、結小緣於此，亦不應雙結在此、雙應在彼，如是大惑亂。今明勝應應菩薩，即盧舍那尊特身，大機所扣者也；劣應應小乘，丈六弊衣，小機所扣者也。今經明常住醍醐與《涅槃》等，法身圓頓與《華嚴》等，所譬長者威德侍衛剎利婆羅門恭敬圍遶，悉指《華嚴》中眷屬皆無異也，所說法相如彼所明亦復無別。婆羅門名淨行，貴族高潔即等覺離垢菩薩也；剎利即是王種，九地已下初地已上也；居士富而不貴，即三十心也。「真珠瓔珞」者，即戒定慧。陀羅尼、三昧，四瓔珞也。「價直千萬」[8]者，即四十地功德，以嚴法身也。「吏民僮僕」者，異門明義，即是稟方便教，斷通惑者名為民，稟別教斷通惑者名為吏；若同門明義者，還是方便波羅蜜也。內與實智同，外與機緣同，喻如吏民有內奉外役之義也。「白拂」者，即是權智之用也。「左右」者，右即入空智用。拂四住塵，左即入假智用；拂無知塵，此二為中道方便，故言侍立(云云)。「覆以寶帳」者，真實慈悲也。「垂諸花幡」者，花即四攝，幡即神通。「香水灑地」，降注[9]法水灑諸菩薩心地以淹惑塵，亦是定水灑散心也。「散眾名花」者，布以七淨花，謂戒、定、慧、斷疑、道非道、知見淨、斷知淨也，戒者攝律儀等三種戒也，定者首楞嚴等也，慧者實智慧也，斷疑者已度二諦之疑也，道非道淨者行於非道通達佛道也，知見淨者智德圓滿了了見佛性也，斷知者斷德成就無明永盡也。「羅列寶物」者，羅列諸地真實功德也。出內如前釋(云云)。「威德特尊」者，光明無邊、色像無邊，相海巍巍堂堂，此義須作舍那之佛，豈得作餘釋耶？

<div class="english-translation">
The cause of seeing the father is detesting suffering and delighting in seeking the flavor of principle, gradually accumulating habits and finally forming supramundane good roots; therefore it says “hiring himself out and going around.” By these good roots he can knock on the Buddha’s compassion, therefore it says “arriving at the father’s house.” The father is a parable of the post‑Path Dharma‑body[^8]; the house is a parable of unconditioned compassion[^9]. The two capacities, great and small, both knock on this house: because there is great capacity, it says “from afar he sees his father”; because there is small capacity, it says “standing at the side of the gate.” If only small and no great, one should not see [6] the honored body; the father should not say, “my stores of wealth now have someone to entrust to.” If only great and no small, one should not stand at the gate side; the son should not say, “this is not a place where I can gain things by hired labor.”  
The place of seeing the father is precisely the gate side. The two contemplations[^62] are expedients, namely the two sides of the gate; the capacity of the Perfect Middle[^11] sees straight at the gate, the two vehicles[^10] are partial‑true[^12], therefore it says gate side; with the emptiness samādhi[^13] and partial‑true wisdom‑eye, they only peer sideways at the Dharma‑body. “From afar he sees his father”: right seeing has two kinds, near seeing and far seeing. Now it says the great capacity has just arisen and the calling response is a far matter, therefore it says “afar”; also the capacity is subtle and not yet met by response, thus it is called “afar.”  
“Squatting on the lion seat” means: the perfect reward Dharma‑body[^59] abides in the principle of emptiness, no longer fearing the two delusions of the Pervasive and Distinct teachings[^60] or the eight Māras[^61]; therefore [7] it is called squatting on the lion seat. The *Avataṃsaka*[^14] teaches ultimate emptiness[^15]; the four fearlessnesses[^16] are the seat. “Jeweled bench supporting the feet” means: samādhi and wisdom are the feet; the real truth[^17] is the bench; the non‑arising samādhi and wisdom[^18] rely on the suchness realm[^19].  
“Brahmins”[^20], the old explanation says, are high and noble great families, from the eighth bhūmi and above; “Kṣatriyas”[^21] are from the seventh bhūmi and below; “householders” are inner‑ordinary beings[^22], etc. The old explanation says: in this sūtra the Dharma‑body is not the permanently abiding Dharma‑body; it is a response body from another land[^23] that comes to respond in this land, and thus becomes the Dharma‑body of this place, therefore there are inner‑ordinary people surrounding it. Now we say it is not so. If it were another‑land Buddha, then the father‑son capacity/response and body/function, wearing and removing, would all fail, as said above. Moreover, it would not permit small capacity to knock here and great capacity to knock there; nor should one bind the great condition there and the small condition here; nor should one bind both here and respond both there—such would be great confusion.  
Now we clarify: the superior response answering bodhisattvas[^24] is precisely the honored body of Rocana[^25]; this is what the great capacity knocks on. The inferior response answers the small vehicle, the sixteen‑foot coarse robe[^26]; this is what the small capacity knocks on. This sūtra clarifies the permanently abiding ghee[^27] with the *Nirvāṇa* sūtra[^28], and the Dharma‑body’s perfect suddenness with the *Avataṃsaka*[^14]; the parable’s elder’s awesome virtue, attendants, Kṣatriyas and Brahmins reverently surrounding, all indicate the retinue in the *Avataṃsaka* with no difference, and the Dharma‑marks spoken are likewise no different from what it explains there.  
“Brahmin” names pure conduct: high and noble, it is the equal‑awakening stainless bodhisattva[^29][^30]; “Kṣatriya” is the royal lineage, from the first bhūmi through the ninth[^32][^31]; “householders” are rich but not noble, namely the thirty minds[^33]. “Pearl necklaces” means precepts, samādhi, and wisdom[^34]; dhāraṇī and samādhi[^35][^36] are the four necklaces[^37]. “Valued at ten million” [8] means the merits of the forty stages[^38], to adorn the Dharma‑body.  
“Clerks, citizens, and servants” means: explained by a distinct gate, it is those who take up the expedient teaching[^39]; those who cut off shared delusions[^40] are called citizens; those who take up the Distinct teaching[^41] and cut off shared delusions are called clerks. If explained by the same gate, it is still the expedient pāramitās[^42]. Internally they accord with real wisdom[^43], externally they accord with capacities and conditions; it is like clerks and citizens who have the meaning of inward service and outward labor. “White whisk” means the function of provisional wisdom[^44]. “Left and right”: the right is the function of entering emptiness[^45], brushing away the dust of the four dwellings[^46]; the left is the function of entering the provisional[^45], brushing away the dust of ignorance[^47]; these two are expedients of the middle way[^48], therefore it says attending (etc.).  
“Covered with jeweled canopy” means true compassion. “Hanging flower banners” means the flowers are the four means of gathering[^49] and the banners are supernormal powers[^50]. “Fragrant water sprinkling the ground” means pouring the Dharma water[^51] to sprinkle the bodhisattvas’ mind‑ground and drown the dust of delusion; it is also the samādhi‑water sprinkling and dispersing the mind. “Scattering many named flowers” means distributing the seven pure flowers[^52]: precepts, samādhi, wisdom, cutting doubt, purity of the way and non‑way, purity of knowledge‑and‑seeing, and purity of cutting knowledge. The precepts are the three kinds of precepts[^53]; samādhi is the Śūraṅgama and the like[^54]; wisdom is real wisdom; cutting doubt means already crossing the doubts of the two truths[^55]; purity of way and non‑way means practicing in the non‑way and reaching the Buddha‑way; purity of knowledge‑and‑seeing means the wisdom‑virtue is complete and clearly sees Buddha‑nature[^56]; cutting knowledge means the virtue of severance is accomplished and ignorance ends forever.  
“Arranging treasures” means arranging the true merits of the various bhūmis; the inner and outer are as previously explained (etc.). “Majesty and virtue are supremely honored” means limitless light, limitless forms, the sea of marks towering and grand; this meaning must be explained as the Śe‑na Buddha[^57]—how could it be explained otherwise?

「窮子見父有大力勢」下，是第四，見父畏避。「大力勢」者，智大故名大力，神通大故名大勢，如上身手有力義也。「恐怖」者，小機劣弱怯懼大道也。「悔來至此」者，佛本欲以大法擬之，應不稱機，但有退大之意，故言悔來至此也。「竊作是念」者，機中潛密冥有此事，非是顯對見勝應身也。「或是王王等」者，波旬是王，徒輩為等，小機灰斷無言說道絕於色像，既見勝應之像，非天人所及，所說法相逈異二乘，小智薄德未曾見聞，便謂是魔是魔所說。略開三顯一，身子狐疑將非魔作佛惱亂我心耶？若初用大逗小疑佛為魔，有過今日也。復次勝應譬長者，長者即表報身佛，故是王等，法身是報師，師即如王，諸經多名是經王，智契於法即是智與法等，故名報佛為等，此乃大乘法報，非是小乘得益之處，故或是王王等也。「非我傭力得物之處」者，小機不能受大化也。「不如往至貧里」乃至「衣食易得」者，《淨名》云「能以貧所得法，度斯下劣」也。但空之理不含萬德非如來藏，故言貧里；偏空稱於小智，故言「肆力有地」也。「衣食易得」者，能得有餘涅槃無漏衣食，行行衣惠行食也。「若久住此或見逼迫強使我作」者，行大乘道經無量劫，故言久住。我本厭怖生死，若修大乘必入生死。廣學萬行，故言逼迫。我本樂小，而今令我發大乘菩提心，是為強使。捨大取小故言「疾走」也。

<div class="english-translation">
Below “the poor son saw the father with great power and authority,” this is the fourth: seeing the father and fearing avoidance. “Great power and authority” means: because wisdom is great it is called great power; because spiritual powers are great it is called great authority; it is like the above meaning of “body and hands having strength.” “Fear and terror” means the small capacity is weak and timid, afraid of the great path. “Regretting coming here” means: the Buddha originally wished to match him with the great Dharma; it would not fit the capacity, and there was only the intention of retreating from the Great; therefore it says “regretting coming here.” “Secretly he made this thought” means: within the capacity there is covertly and obscurely this matter; it is not a manifest face‑to‑face seeing of the superior response‑body. “Perhaps he is a king or the like” means: Pāpīyān is the king and his followers are the like. The small capacity ashes and cuts, with no speech and the Way cut off from form and appearance; once it sees the image of the superior response, which is beyond devas and humans, and the Dharma‑marks spoken are far different from the two vehicles—small wisdom and thin virtue have never seen or heard it—thus they say it is Māra and Māra’s teaching. Slightly opening the three and revealing the one, Śāriputra was suspicious: could it be Māra making the Buddha to trouble my mind? If at first the great is used to meet the small and one doubts the Buddha is Māra, that is a fault greater than today. Moreover, the superior response is a parable of the elder; the elder represents the reward‑body Buddha; therefore he is “king and the like.” The dharma‑body is the reward’s teacher; the teacher is like a king. Many sūtras call it the king of sūtras; wisdom matching the Dharma is wisdom and Dharma being equal, therefore the reward‑Buddha is called “the like.” This is the Mahāyāna Dharma‑reward, not the place where the Small Vehicle obtains benefit; therefore it says “perhaps a king or the like.” “This is not a place where my hired labor can obtain things” means the small capacity cannot receive the great conversion. “Better to go to the poor village” up to “clothing and food are easy to obtain”: the *Vimalakīrti* says, “With the Dharma obtained in poverty, one can ferry these lower [beings].” The principle of mere emptiness does not include the myriad virtues and is not the tathāgata‑store; therefore it is called the poor village. Partial emptiness corresponds to small wisdom; therefore it says “a place where one can exert oneself.” “Clothing and food are easy to obtain” means one can obtain the unconditioned clothing and food of with‑remainder nirvāṇa: conduct is clothing, beneficent conduct is food. “If one dwells here long, one might be pressed and forced to make me work” means: practicing the Mahāyāna path passes through immeasurable kalpas, therefore it says long dwelling. I originally detest and fear birth‑and‑death; if I cultivate the Mahāyāna I must enter birth‑and‑death. Broadly learning the myriad practices, therefore it is called being pressed. I originally delight in the small; now he makes me arouse the Mahāyāna bodhi‑mind—this is forcing. Abandoning the great and taking the small, therefore it says “fleeing quickly.”

Below “At that time the wealthy elder,” second, is the parable of the father seeing the son. It also has four: (1) the father sees the son’s place, (2) seeing the son he immediately recognizes him, (3) seeing the son he rejoices, (4) seeing the son he fits the wish. The place of seeing the son is precisely the lion seat. The Tathāgata’s dharma‑body abides in the fearless realm of ultimate‑meaning emptiness, clearly illuminating capacities. Seeing the son and immediately recognizing him means knowing he is a being who formed affinities in past days. The great rejoicing of the mind: the Buddha always waits for the son’s capacity; now the capacity comes and accords with compassion, therefore he rejoices—this is receiving the Dharma exposition and arousing great compassion. In the burning‑house it is great alarm and fear; there it clarifies rescuing from suffering, therefore it says alarm and fear; here it clarifies giving joy, therefore it says rejoicing. “He then made this thought: now there is someone to entrust the storehouse and treasury” is seeing the son fitting the wish. Formerly, seeing beings retreat from the Great and take the small, in a poor village seeking food to sustain life with difficulty, he always wished to give wealth but had no capacity and could not; today the capacity comes and accords with the great compassionate mind, therefore it says now the storehouse and treasury have someone to entrust. “I always think of him” clarifies that it is not only poverty and lack of great wealth, but also cycling through birth‑and‑death and being pressed by many sufferings, painful to great compassion; therefore it says he always thinks of him. Although he wished to rescue, without capacity he could not save; therefore it says “there was no way to see him.” Now a capacity that can be crossed over arises, therefore it says “and suddenly he comes by himself.” Calling it the [1] great compassionate mind, therefore it says “very much fits my wish.” “Although I am old and worn, I still cherish” explains the reason for fitting the wish: because one period of transformation is completed, it says old and worn; without seeing a great capacity, the Dharma has no entrustment—who will the future followers obtain liberation from? Because there is a capacity that can be crossed over, therefore he cherishes. Now the capacity comes by itself and there is no such worry; therefore my wish is obtained and fitted [2].

Below “Immediately dispatches a bystander to urgently chase and bring back,” third clarifies the parable of chasing and luring; near it receives the burning‑house’s “discarding the bench and using carts”[^3], far it receives the Dharma‑exposition’s withholding the great and giving the small. This text is two: first, dispatching a bystander to chase; second, dispatching two men to lure. The earlier chase receives the above “body and hands having strength, yet not using it,” but in the *Expedients* chapter[^63] the overall admonition and encouragement are one and the commentary is three; in the burning‑house, encouragement is opened and admonition is brought out, and the commentary has three for each; the “letting go” text is brief, the long‑prose combines encouragement but does not combine admonition, and the “ceasing conversion” text is broad; in the verses only admonition is versified and encouragement is not, and ceasing conversion is not versified—there are appearances and disappearances in all. In the burning‑house long‑prose, admonition, encouragement, and explanation each have three; now they are combined and received.  
“Immediately dispatches a bystander who quickly runs and seizes” receives the fitting of the encouragement gate; “the poor son is alarmed” receives the encouragement gate’s lack of capacity; “forcibly dragging back” receives the fitting of the admonition gate; “the poor son himself thinks ‘I am without罪’” through “fainting and falling to the ground” receives the admonition gate’s lack of capacity. From “the father sees from afar” below, it also receives the ceasing conversion of both encouragement and admonition. This probes the Buddha’s intent: although the encouragement gate was fitting yet without capacity, his intent had not yet ceased; he further made the admonition gate fitting; unable to accomplish it, only then did he cease conversion.  
“Dispatching the bystander” means the first encouragement gate’s fitting: wisdom is the dispatcher, teaching is what is dispatched; the meaning of principle is the proper, the meaning of teaching is the side. From the Buddha issues the Mahāyāna twelve divisions[^69][^67] to fit beings; those without capacity do not accept; for them it is like milk, therefore it says “dispatching a bystander.” Moreover, the bystander is like side ministers and assistants; that is, dispatching Dharma‑body bodhisattvas[^68][^8] to preach the Mahāyāna[^69], as in the *Avataṃsaka*[^14] where four bodhisattvas are made to preach the forty stages[^38]—this is “dispatching a bystander.” “Quickly runs and seizes” means: the Mahāyāna clarifies principle in a manifest and straightforward way; using this to meet capacity, it swiftly heads toward bodhi[^72]; therefore in the great cart it says its speed is like wind. If we take bodhisattvas as the bystanders, the bodhisattvas themselves have spiritual power, and also receive the Buddha’s empowerment, and thus can cause them to swiftly enter bodhi.  
“The poor son is alarmed” is precisely the encouragement gate’s lack of capacity. Once no capacity appears, even if he had aroused it in the past, it has long been abandoned and forgotten; suddenly hearing the great teaching, it conflicts with his mind, therefore he is alarmed; not recognizing it, therefore he is startled. “Crying out in resentment” means: the Small Vehicle[^73] takes afflictions[^74] as enemies and birth‑and‑death[^75] as suffering; if one encourages “afflictions are bodhi,” he cries out loudly, calling it a wrongful resentment; if he hears “birth‑and‑death is nirvāṇa”[^28], he cries out loudly, calling it painful suffering. No capacity does not accept—this is the encouragement gate. “I do not offend” means: I do not intrude or seek; why use the great conversion on me? This receives the two intentions of the encouragement gate, not yet the ceasing conversion. Next, after calling again he does not come; “seizing him more urgently” receives the fitting of the admonition gate. Earlier it clarified that encouraging good is still tolerable[3]; I should speak fearful matters—this is the urgency. [4] Although “forcibly dragging back” means admonishing with painful words to make him keep far from evil. Internally he already lacks capacity; externally he is forced by great conversion—this is forcibly dragging back. “He himself thinks ‘I am without罪’” receives not accepting the admonition gate: 죄 is compassion; because beings have罪 they enter the prison of birth‑and‑death, and bodhisattvas likewise enter that prison. Two‑vehicle people lack great compassion[^5], and are called without罪. To make them enter birth‑and‑death is to be imprisoned; without great expedient means and yet entering birth‑and‑death, they will certainly forever lose the wisdom‑life[^77] of the three vehicles[^76], therefore it says “must die.” Thinking these things, therefore it says “even more terrified.” Forcing them with the great teaching, small wisdom cannot understand, therefore it says “fainting.” At once slander arises and they must fall into the three evil paths[^78], therefore it says “falling to the ground”; this is also being deluded and sinking into the ground of ignorance[^79].

<div class="english-translation">
Below “the father sees from afar,” this is third: letting go of encouragement and admonition and ceasing the Mahāyāna conversion. In this there are four: (1) contemplating the ceasing of conversion, (2) explaining the ceasing of conversion, (3) directly ceasing conversion, (4) ceasing conversion as fitting. First there are two intents: one, knowing the great aspiration is weak; two, knowing the small aspiration is strong. “The father sees from afar” means the small has gone far from the great, therefore it is called “afar”; because he is a son with a connection‑binding, therefore it says he sees him.  
“And he tells the messenger” means: with respect to teaching, the messenger is the teaching [1]; wisdom originally speaks the teaching, wisdom knows there is no capacity, when wisdom ceases the teaching ceases. With respect to persons, the messenger means: he tells the bodhisattvas, “you need not display your honored and wondrous bodies to let the two vehicles see.” In the *Vimalakīrti* it says, “gather in your body’s fragrance; do not let those beings give rise to deluded attachment”; when Samantabhadra enters this Sahā world he contracts his body and makes it small—this is all the same meaning.  
“Do not force him to come” means: since there is no great capacity, fearing injury to his good roots[^80], therefore it says do not force. Privately we say: “we do not need this person” means contemplating the ceasing of the encouragement gate’s fitting; “do not force him to come” means contemplating the ceasing of the admonition gate’s fitting.  
“Cold water sprinkling the face” is second: knowing there is a small aspiration, it is fitting to use the ash‑extinction principle‑water[^81] to remove the heat of views and thoughts[^82]. “Face” means: detesting birth‑and‑death is called “back,” turning to nirvāṇa is like “face.” “Awakening” means: opening the small and meeting the capacity to leave vexation and realize the four noble truths[^83]. “Do not speak to him further” means: one should decisively cease Mahāyāna teaching.  
Below “Why is that?” is second, explaining the intent of ceasing conversion: he truly detests suffering and delights in emptiness, is intimate with the lower, lacking a compassionate mind; thus he fears the great Dharma. For now, allow his small aspiration and restrain the Buddha’s own [3] original intent; therefore he ceases conversion. He knows clearly that among the twenty‑thousand Buddhas he once aroused the mind of the Way; it is not that there is entirely no great capacity. For now he ceases great conversion; the Buddha’s intent is not yet finished and waits for a later time.  
“Not speaking to others” means: within the former small‑vehicle teaching, speaking in accord with others’ intent, the expedient covers and protects by calling them śrāvakas; one does not speak in accord with one’s own intent and say they are bodhisattvas.  
Below “the messenger tells him” is third, directly clarifying the ceasing of conversion. “I now release you” means: it is precisely knowing the great capacity is weak and following where he wishes; it is also knowing the small good is strong. Because of these two conditions, he ceases the great conversion.  
Below “the poor son rejoices” is fourth: ceasing conversion fitting the capacity. Not being forced by the great teaching, therefore “rejoices”; having no great罪 of slander and being spared the three paths[^78], therefore it says “from the ground”; the small good arises, therefore it says “he rises.” Moreover, earlier the great Dharma was fitting, but he was confused and did not understand, lying on the ground of ignorance; now he is met with the small and can awaken, therefore it says “he rises from the ground.” In the Four Truths he seeks the path‑Dharma, therefore it says “he goes to the poor hamlet seeking clothing and food”; or he seeks the path within the four views, therefore it says “poor hamlet.”

「將欲誘引」下，是密遣二人誘引，此為二：一、齊教，近領三車救子，遠領波羅柰施權；次、從「又以他日」下，取意，領法身地久照方便，非道樹始知用小，早鑒眾生，致難尊特親狎垢衣，故追領往前以成今解。

問：

四大弟子，何因能知法身久照？

答：

推近知遠，若始道樹知無大機，不應兜率降神正慧託胎，乃至現有煩惱納妃生子，三十四心後身斷結，驗知脫大小相海微妙瓔珞，更著麁弊丈六垢衣，其已久矣。今初且釋齊教。領者，〈譬喻品〉文有四：一、用方便擬宜，二、知先心，三、歎三車，四、適其所願，〈方便品〉亦四。今領亦四：從「將欲誘引」下，是領上擬宜。「時二使人即求窮子，既已得之」，領上知子先心有機也。「具陳上事」，領上歎三車希有。「窮子先取其價」下，領上適願爭出火宅也。初、「將欲誘引」者，既息大化不容孤棄，欲設方便，故言將欲。「密遣二人」者，四弟子齊己分領，不涉菩薩，故言二人。約法是因緣四諦，約理是有作真俗，約人是聲聞緣覺。初擬大乘云密遣傍人，表一實諦、一大乘教、一菩薩人，今明方便，隱實為密，指偏真為遣。約教，隱滿字為密，指半字言遣。約人，內祕菩薩行故言密，外現是聲聞故言遣。「形」者，二乘教中不修相好，但說苦、無常、不淨，即是「形色憔悴」也。約人，則諸菩薩隱其本色示以迹形。非了義說，無有十力無畏，名「無威德」也。「汝可詣彼」者，即以小教擬小機也。大教明理直實，故言「疾走往捉」；小教明理迂隱，故云「徐語」。「此有作處」者，見修兩道是斷惑作處也。「倍與汝直」者，五戒十善止出三途，今四諦十二因緣能出生死，是為一倍；又外道六行但能伏惑，今修四諦則能斷惑得至涅槃，是為二倍也。「窮子若許」者，有機是許，即設教；無機是不許，不設教。「欲何所作」者，二乘唯欲除惑取證，不論淨佛國土成就眾生。所以言「雇汝除糞，我等二人亦共作」者，二乘鈍根憑教行行方能修業，約理者即是智諦相資也，約人即權人共實人修行也。「時二使人即求窮子」者，第二，審知有機，故[7]言「已得」，領上知先心也。「具陳上事」下，第三，陳說雇作，領上歎三車也。除苦集之糞，取道滅之價。「窮子先取其價尋與除糞」下，第四，尋即為作，領上適願爭出火宅也。二乘慕果行因，所以先取也。「其父見子愍而[8]怪之」者，怪不求佛道，愍其取阿羅漢，所失者大、所得者寡，故言怪也。齊此領法譬中意，其文竟。從「又以他日」下，第二，是取意領，靈智先照久設權謀崎嶇[9]隨逐，非止樹下始見因緣，已如上說。此文為四：一、「又以他日」取意領先以權智久欲擬宜；二、見子憔悴，是久知方便是其玩好；三、脫妙著麁，領久知須歎三車；四、親教子作，久知適願受行今初。「又」者，鄭重辭也。將欲取意領法身之地久知大小之機(一三)施化，重述佛意故標章稱「又」也。「他日」者，二乘自謂方便為己，非二乘法為他，即擬法身也。「日」者時也，亦智也，依法身之時，用智照機，故言「他日」。若從此義，實智照實為自，權智照方便為他。齊教領，領化身用事為己日，非化身用事為他日。若就如來，自行權實之智皆名為己，如來化他權實之照，皆名為他。如來自他權實之照，照實為己，照權為他。此之探領法身之時，用化他之權智，照於權機若有若無，照用權事若可若否，皆是權智所照，故言他日。若從此義，齊教領，領化他之權事，故二乘稱己[1]事，探領[2]領自他之權，此權非二乘事，故稱為他。雖有兩意，他日俱成，今依二乘所領，又逐他日之文，以探領領法身中照機也。「[3]牖窓」者，偏見則小，表權智照彼偏機也。「遙」者，小去大懸，故名為遙。「見子」者，昔曾種大稱之為子，以大擬之故言為見。窓牖偏狹未宜大化，故息大而施小也。「羸瘦」下，第二，是領先知有小玩好也。修因智力少為「羸」，修因福力少為「瘦」，內怖無常為「憔」，外遭八苦為「悴」。四住為「糞土」，無知為「塵坌」也。「即脫瓔珞」下，第三，是領先知須歎三車希有也。脫妙服，譬隱報身無量功德。四十二地戒定慧陀羅尼等「瓔珞」，寂滅忍「細軟上服」，大小相海「嚴飾之具」。容服若盛子則驚畏，二乘不宜見此相好，是故脫之。「更著麁弊」者，現丈六形是麁，生忍、法忍是弊也。「塵土坌身」者，現有煩惱有為有漏也。「執除糞」下，但治見思有漏之法，不論諸地清淨智慧也。左手喻實，右手喻權，權用便易，自以此法斷結成佛，又用此化人。「狀有所畏」者，[4]示同怖生死，又有寒風馬麥之報也。

<div class="english-translation">
Below “about to lure and lead,” this is the secret dispatch of two men to lure and lead. This is two: first, the equal teaching[^84]; near it receives the three carts saving the son[^85], far it receives Benares applying the provisional[^86]; second, from “again on another day” below, it takes the intent, receiving the Dharma‑body ground’s[^87] long illumination of expedients[^1]. It was not only under the Bodhi tree[^88] that he first knew to use the small; he already discerned beings early. Thus it was difficult for the honored and special to be intimate with dirty clothes, so he retrieves the earlier (parables) to complete the present explanation.  

**Question:** Why can the four great disciples know that the Dharma‑body has long illuminated?  
**Answer:** We infer the far from the near: if, at the beginning under the Bodhi tree, he knew there was no great capacity, he should not have descended from Tuṣita[^89], entrusted the embryo with right wisdom[^90], and up through manifesting afflictions, taking a consort, and begetting a son. After thirty‑four minds[^91] in the final body he cut off bonds; this verifies that he removed the great and small mark‑sea’s subtle necklaces[^92] and again put on a coarse and shabby sixteen‑foot dirty robe—this has been long indeed.  

Now we first explain the equal‑teaching reception. The received: in the *Parable* chapter[^93] the text has four—(1) using expedients to fit the suitable, (2) knowing the former mind, (3) praising the three carts, (4) suiting what is wished; the *Expedients* chapter[^63] also has four. Now the reception is also four: from “about to lure and lead” below, it receives the fitting above; “the two messengers then sought the poor son; once they had found him” receives above knowing the son’s former mind has capacity; “fully stating the above matters” receives above praising the three carts as rare; below “the poor son first takes his wages” receives above suiting the wish, striving to exit the burning house.  

First, “about to lure and lead” means: since he has ceased the great conversion and cannot leave him alone, he wishes to set up expedients; therefore it says “about to.” “Secretly dispatching two men” means: the four disciples each receive according to their own portion, not involving bodhisattvas, therefore it says two men. In terms of Dharma it is the Four Truths[^83] and the Twelve Links[^99]; in terms of principle it is the constructed true and conventional[^100]; in terms of persons it is śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas[^101].  
At first, fitting the great vehicle said “secretly dispatching a bystander,” representing one real truth[^94], one Mahāyāna teaching[^69], one bodhisattva person[^68]. Now clarifying expedients, he hides the real as “secret,” and points to the partial‑true as “dispatch.” In terms of teaching, hiding the full‑character teaching[^95] is “secret,” and pointing to the half‑character teaching[^95] is “dispatch.” In terms of persons, secretly holding bodhisattva practice within is “secret,” while outwardly appearing as śrāvaka is “dispatch.”  

“Appearance” means: within the two‑vehicle teaching there is no cultivation of marks and characteristics[^102]; they only speak of suffering, impermanence, and impurity—this is “emaciated in form and color.” In terms of persons, the bodhisattvas hide their original form and display a trace‑form. Because it is not an ultimate teaching, there are no ten powers or fearlessnesses[^96]; this is called “without majesty and virtue.”  

“You may go to him” means: it is precisely using the small teaching to fit the small capacity. The great teaching clarifies principle directly and truly, therefore it says “quickly run and seize”; the small teaching clarifies principle in a roundabout and hidden way, therefore it says “slowly speak.” “This is a place of doing” means: the paths of seeing and cultivation[^97] are places where delusions are cut and practice is done.  

“Double your wages” means: the five precepts and ten good deeds[^98] only exit the three evil paths[^78]; now the Four Truths and Twelve Links can exit birth‑and‑death[^75]—this is one doubling. Moreover, the non‑Buddhists’ six practices[^103] only subdue delusions; now cultivating the Four Truths can cut delusions and reach nirvāṇa[^28]—this is a second doubling. “If the poor son agrees” means: if there is capacity, he agrees and teaching is established; if there is no capacity, he does not agree and no teaching is established.  

“What do you wish to do?” means: the two vehicles only wish to cut off delusion and obtain realization; they do not discuss purifying Buddha‑lands or accomplishing beings. Therefore it says, “We hire you to remove filth; we two will also work with you.” Two‑vehicle dull roots rely on teaching and practice—only by practice can they cultivate deeds. In terms of principle, this is wisdom and truth supporting each other; in terms of persons, it is provisional persons practicing together with real persons[^105].  

“The two messengers then sought the poor son” is second: they carefully know there is capacity, therefore [7] it says “already found,” receiving above knowing the former mind. “Fully stating the above matters” below, third, explains the hiring and work, receiving above praising the three carts. Removing the filth of suffering and accumulation, they take the wages of the path and cessation. Below “the poor son first takes his wages and then removes filth,” fourth, immediately he works, receiving above suiting the wish and striving to exit the burning house. The two vehicles admire the fruit and practice the cause; therefore they take it first.  

“The father sees the son, pities and [8] is puzzled” means: he is puzzled that he does not seek the Buddha‑path, and pities that he chooses arhatship[^104]; what is lost is great and what is gained is small, therefore it says “puzzled.” Up to here, the intent of receiving the Dharma‑parable is complete.  

From “again on another day” below, second, it is receiving by intent: numinous wisdom first illuminates and for long sets up provisional strategy, rugged and [9] following; it is not only under the tree that he first sees causes and conditions—this is already as said above. This text is four: (1) “again on another day,” receiving by intent that long ago with provisional wisdom he wished to fit the suitable; (2) seeing the son emaciated is knowing for a long time that expedients are his play‑thing; (3) removing the wondrous and putting on the coarse receives knowing for a long time that one must praise the three carts; (4) personally instructing the son to work receives knowing for a long time and suiting the wish to accept practice.  

“Again” is a word of emphasis. Wishing to receive by intent the Dharma‑body ground’s long‑knowing of great and small capacities (one, three) in transforming, he restates the Buddha’s intent, therefore he marks the section with “again.” “Another day” means: the two vehicles regard expedients as for self; what is not the two‑vehicle Dharma is for others—this thus models the Dharma‑body. “Day” means time, and also wisdom; relying on the Dharma‑body’s time, he uses wisdom to illuminate capacities, therefore it says “another day.” If from this meaning, real wisdom illumining the real is self; provisional wisdom illumining expedients is other. The equal‑teaching reception receives the transformation‑body’s acts as one’s own day, and not the transformation‑body’s acts as another day.  

If with respect to the Tathāgata, the wisdom of provisional and real in self‑practice are all called self; the illumination of provisional and real in transforming others are all called other. The Tathāgata’s illumination of self and other—illumining the real is self, illumining the provisional is other. This probing reception of the Dharma‑body’s time uses the transforming‑others’ provisional wisdom, illuminating whether provisional capacities exist or not, and whether provisional matters are possible or not; all are what provisional wisdom illuminates, therefore it says “another day.” If from this meaning, the equal‑teaching reception receives the provisional matters of transforming others; therefore the two vehicles call them their own [1] matters. This probing reception [2] receives the self/other provisional; this provisional is not a two‑vehicle matter, therefore it is called other. Though there are two meanings, “another day” is completed in both.  

Now, according to what the two vehicles receive, and following the text of “another day,” it probes the reception of illuminating capacities in the Dharma‑body. “[3] window” means: partial view is small, expressing provisional wisdom illuminating those partial capacities. “Afar” means: the small is far from the great, therefore it is called far. “Seeing the son” means: long ago he planted the great and called him a son; fitting him with the great, therefore it says he sees him. The window is narrow and not fit for great conversion, therefore he ceases the great and applies the small.  

Below “emaciated and thin,” second, it receives knowing in advance that he has small play‑things. In cultivating causes, his power of wisdom is small, thus “emaciated”; his power of merit is small, thus “thin.” Internally fearing impermanence is “haggard”; externally encountering the eight sufferings[^29] is “withered.” The four dwellings[^46] are “filth‑soil,” and ignorance[^79] is “dust.”  

Below “immediately removes the necklaces,” third, it receives knowing in advance that one must praise the three carts as rare. Removing wondrous clothing is a parable of hiding the reward‑body’s immeasurable merits. The necklaces of the forty‑two stages[^106]—precepts, samādhi, wisdom, dhāraṇī, etc.—the “fine soft upper garment” of quiescent‑extinction patience[^107], the great and small mark‑sea “ornaments”: if the splendid clothing is shown, the son would be frightened; the two vehicles are not fit to see these marks, therefore he removes them. “Again putting on the coarse and shabby” means: manifesting the sixteen‑foot form is coarse; birth‑patience and Dharma‑patience[^108] are shabby. “Dust and dirt covering the body” means: manifesting afflictions, the conditioned and the defiled.  

Below “holding the filth‑remover,” he only treats the defiled dharmas of views and thoughts[^82], not the pure wisdom of the various bhūmis. The left hand is a parable of the real, the right hand a parable of the provisional; the provisional is easy to use—by this Dharma he cuts bonds and becomes Buddha, and by this he transforms people. “Appearance as if fearful” [4] means: showing himself as equally fearing birth‑and‑death, and also having the karmic retribution of cold winds and horse‑feed.

Below “telling the workers,” this is the fourth: the parable of personally teaching the son to work. It is precisely the seven sets of path factors, in order to clarify the aspect of removing filth; it receives above where the sons’ minds are each brave and sharp, mutually pushing and racing, competing to flee the burning house. First, the parable of telling the workers corresponds to the four foundations of mindfulness as the stage of external ordinary persons. Second, the parable of ordering diligent work without slackness corresponds to the four right efforts. Third, “Ho, man!” and “do not go elsewhere” corresponds to the four bases of miraculous power. Fourth, below “calm your mind well,” the comfort parable corresponds to the five roots. Fifth, below “why is this,” the parable of no five faults corresponds to the five powers. These preceding four clauses are the second stage of inner ordinary persons. Sixth, the parable of the elder immediately giving him a name and calling him a son corresponds to the eightfold right path. Seventh, below “although he rejoiced at this encounter,” the parable of constantly teaching him to remove filth corresponds to the seven factors of awakening. These two clauses are the third stage of the noble.

Now first, “telling the workers” means: he expounds the Tripiṭaka[^109] and shows the four foundations of mindfulness[^110]; this is the tool for removing filth, the realm where bonds are cut. The *Bequeathed Teachings*[^111] says, “Constantly relying on the mindfulness foundations in practice can break the four inversions.”[^112] This receives the burning‑house’s “suited wish, brave and sharp,” which is precisely hearing‑wisdom[^113].  
Second, “do not be lax or idle” means: it is precisely causing diligent cultivation of the four mindfulness foundations. If laxity arises one cannot extinguish the two evils or produce the two goods. By the two diligences[^114], one can kindle the warmth‑fire and, in relation to the burning‑house’s mutual pushing and jostling, enter the warmth stage of cultivating wisdom[^115]. “By expedient [5] one can approach his son” means: the mindfulness foundations have not yet gained the principle‑fire that warms the mind, so one remains a distant outsider and cannot approach; with the initial warmth‑expedient one can approach.  
Third, “Ho, man!”: “ho” is both startling and reproaching. In the above right‑effort, the scattered stirring is wisdom‑dharma; “man” is yang‑nature. The bases of miraculous power[^117] are samādhi‑dharma; “woman” is yin‑nature. Because right‑effort’s stirring cannot yet accord with true suchness, he uses “ho” to startle and reproach, causing one to abandon scattering and enter stillness; therefore “Ho, man!”  
“Work here constantly, do not go elsewhere” means: mindfulness foundations and right‑effort are active and not single‑minded, thus they are not called “constant.” In the four bases of miraculous power, samādhi does not differ in its object: with contemplation there is samādhi, with contemplation there is severance; samādhi and severance are unified, therefore “constant”; not scattered, therefore “do not go elsewhere.” This is still within mutual pushing and jostling, and is the position of the summit‑dharma[^116].  
“I will increase your wages” means: in the warmth‑dharma’s intention‑contemplation one cannot yet produce the real; in the base‑of‑power contemplation one can produce the outflow‑free, therefore it says “increase the wage.” If anything is needed, outflow and outflow‑free goods, auxiliary path and right path, all are sought from base‑of‑power contemplation; once desired, one obtains.  
The four dhyānas[^118] contain the [6] branches like a bowl‑vessel; arising‑emptiness is coarse like rice, dharma‑emptiness is fine like flour—this is the right path. Under the Four Truths, the sixteen‑aspect contemplation[^119]: impermanence is like salt, suffering like vinegar—this is the auxiliary path. As rice‑flour is hard to eat and requires salt and vinegar, the right path is hard to manifest and needs the auxiliary path to assist it.  
“Do not doubt or fear” means: concluding the right and auxiliary above. Assured that it lies in base‑of‑power contemplation, therefore he says do not doubt; it can certainly be accomplished—like one’s own possessions—therefore he says do not fear.  
“There are also old, worn‑out servants” means: if one wishes to directly obtain supernormal powers to substitute for hands and feet, it is like employing servants to drive and labor. In base‑of‑power contemplation there are also such powers; but the powers are weak, similar to old and worn‑out (servants); though not strong, they can still carry and work. Moreover, by the right path one seeks principle; the right path is weak and cannot yet produce the real, therefore one needs the auxiliary path: the nine contemplations, ten contemplations, eight relinquishments, etc.[^120] The auxiliary‑path servants are: in base‑of‑power contemplation there is also such Dharma; if the auxiliary assists the right, one becomes a co‑liberated person.  
Fourth, “calm your mind well” means: attaining the five roots[^121] and being secure, hard to break. “I am like your father” means: patience‑understanding is near the real but only a semblance, not yet real; therefore it says “like a father,” and also “like a son.” “Do not again worry” means: he causes them to calm their minds and break the views‑and‑thoughts[^82].  
Fifth, “I am old, you are young” means: the Buddha dwells at the end of the path with wisdom and severance complete, therefore he is called old and great; you dwell at the start of the path without wisdom and severance, therefore you are called young and strong. This is the patience‑dharma stage[^122]. “Without five faults” means: attaining the five powers[^123] and leaving the five evil dharmas. By the power of faith one does not deceive; by the power of diligence one is not lazy; by the power of mindfulness one is not angry; by the power of samādhi one does not hate; by the power of wisdom one does not speak resentfully.  
“Other workers” means: from afar it points to non‑Buddhists, those who seek principle through various views are called other workers; nearby it points to the four stages such as warmth, which have not yet left the five faults and are also called other workers. This passage’s “without five faults” is precisely the five powers.  
“From now on you are like a son born to me” means: in the lower patience, sixteen instants are still long; the middle patience, though it shortens contemplation, is still not a single instant; if the upper patience is the final worldly instant, with its mind close to the real and pressing the saintly, therefore this stage is called “like a son born to me,” i.e., the world‑first‑dharma stage[^124].  
Sixth, “immediately the elder again gives him a name and calls him a son” means: attaining the eightfold right path[^125] and entering the path of seeing, they compete and race; therefore it says he names him son. Because world‑first‑dharma is not long from the real, it says “immediately.” The *Āgama*[^126] speaks of five kinds of Buddha‑sons: the four fruits[^127] and pratyekabuddha are called true Buddha‑sons; bodhisattvas do not cut bonds, so the son‑meaning is not yet complete.  
Below “although the poor son rejoiced at this encounter,” seventh, is the parable of continually making him hire himself out. Although he is a son, his reflection is not yet exhausted and he still abides in the learning stage without reaching “no‑difficulties”; therefore for twenty years he is constantly made to remove filth. He also knows himself unfit to inherit the great, and is precisely relying on the teaching to practice and exhaust suffering; therefore it says “he still called himself a hired low person.” If he obtains the first fruit[^128], detesting the small and delighting in the great, and the Mahāyāna capacity arises, then one should immediately grant the Mahāyāna and there would be no need to go on cutting the remaining residual bonds. Precisely because he does not abandon the small aspiration and the great capacity does not arise, therefore he is for now made to rely on the teaching and exhaust the outflows; thus it says “therefore for twenty years he was constantly made to remove filth.”  
“Twenty years” means: in seeing the truths[^129], one liberation and one non‑hindrance; in contemplation, nine non‑hindrances and nine liberations—therefore it says twenty years. Another says: cutting bonds within the two paths of seeing and thought is called twenty years. Another says: five lower and five higher fetters[^130] are twenty years. Another says: still within the two‑vehicle Dharma, cutting thought‑delusions, therefore called twenty years. Another says: relying on the two messengers, together cutting the remaining bonds, therefore called twenty years. Because he came with the two‑vehicle capacity and resonated with the Buddha, therefore it says “since he saw his son it has been twenty years.” If one dwells in the two‑vehicle position and turns to Mahāyāna teaching, this is called “within twenty years he handled household affairs.” The “twenty” statements each have their reasons; pointing to this one sentence, it is precisely the stage of striving to exit the three‑realm burning house.

<div class="english-translation">
Below “After this,” this is the fourth receiving of the parable of entrusting the household business; near it receives the burning‑house’s equal bestowal of the great cart, far it receives the Dharma‑exposition’s unsurpassed path[^131]. Here it is two: first the receiving, then the entrusting. Each is again two. Together they receive the four meanings in the burning‑house’s equal bestowal of the [1] cart, which are also the four meanings of revealing the real[^132] in the *Expedients* chapter[^63].  
In the first chapter there are two: (1) mutual trust of minds[^133], which receives the above “escaping difficulty”; (2) entrusting the household business, gradually by openness and ease[^134] accomplishing the great aspiration, which receives the above “requesting the cart.” In the latter chapter there are two: (1) entrusting the household business, which receives the equal bestowal of the great cart; (2) joy in receiving the entrustment, which receives the above “joy at obtaining the cart.” Because mutual trust of minds is present, one can entrust the household business; once the household business is thoroughly known and understanding complete, the great aspiration is accomplished. Because the will becomes open and free, one can be entrusted with the household business, and being entrusted is itself joy. Since there are far and near causes, if one had not first taught him to hire himself out and given a single day’s wages, how could one reach mutual trust, entrust the enterprise, and transfer the wealth?  
Internally this corresponds: because by the Tripiṭaka[^109] the bonds are cut, one is able to hear the *Mahāsamnipāta*[^135], receive the scolding in the *Vimalakīrti*[^136], and transmit the *Prajñā*[^137], thereby leading to entrusting the wealth. You should know that hiring and taking wages is the far cause; mutual trust and entrusting the enterprise is the near cause.  
Moreover, in the earlier parable of luring there is an equal‑teaching reception, starting from the Bodhi tree and ending when leaving the house; there is also a probing reception, starting from the Dharma‑body and ending when thoughts are exhausted. The present reception is also two: it begins with the probing reception of the four [2] positions of compassion being matured, and ends with receiving the entrusting of wealth as the ultimate single flavor. The far and near, beginning and end, are together discussed as the five flavors[^139].  
Why? Immediately dispatching the bystander: what the bystander says is a parable of the *Avataṃsaka*’s perfect suddenness. This teaching is the first; the bystander is a parable of the cow, what is spoken is a parable of milk. Internally it corresponds to the twelve divisions of the canon[^67] emerging from the Buddha; this is the first flavor. Using this to fit the two‑vehicle people, having no capacity they do not accept and fall fainting to the ground; for them, in their complete rawness, it is like the flavor of milk.  
Next, clarifying the secret dispatch of two men to speak the dung‑removal Dharma: this is a parable of, after ceasing the great, speaking the three at Deer Park[^140]; for the small they immediately believe and [3] transform from ordinary to sage, like turning milk into curds. Internally it corresponds to sūtras[^138] emerging from the twelve divisions; this is the second flavor.  
Next, clarifying mutual trust of minds and coming and going without difficulty: this is a parable of, after the Tripiṭaka, speaking Vaipulya and the *Vimalakīrti*, praising the great and scolding the small. The two vehicles hearing the great do not slander, and being scolded for the small they do not retreat. This is because by cutting bonds in the Tripiṭaka and taking one day’s wages, they can tolerate praise and blame; if they had not cut bonds they could not bear hearing the praise of the great, like earlier they did not accept the encouragement gate; nor could they bear hearing the scolding of the small, like earlier they did not accept the admonition gate. Now they do not slander and do not retreat because the minds mutually trust. Having personally certified the small, they trust that the great is not false; having obtained the price of nirvāṇa, they accept scolding without anger. Though it is not their own affair, they do not doubt or slander. This mind is ripe, like fresh butter arising from curds; internally it corresponds to Vaipulya sūtras emerging from the sūtras, this is the third flavor.  
Next, clarifying below “the elder himself knows he will die before long”: this is a parable of, after Vaipulya, mutual trust of minds and coming and going without difficulty, he entrusts the household business, causing them to receive instruction and teach Mahāprajñā for great bodhisattvas. Once they receive and know all the goods, threading the Dharma‑doors, their minds become clear and mouths eloquent, increasingly delighted, only regretting that staying in the small is not their own share; if it were further opened and allowed, how could they not rejoice? Thus the mind gradually becomes open and free, accomplishing the great aspiration, like cooked butter arising from fresh butter[^141]. This is the passage from Vaipulya to Mahāprajñā, the fourth flavor.  
Next, “when nearing the end he commands his son”: this is a parable of, after Prajñā [4], determining the inherent nature and fixing father and son, bringing the three back to one, entrusting wealth and predictions [5], teaching the *Lotus*[^142]: opening the Buddha‑knowledge and vision[^142], showing the true real mark[^143]. Bodhisattva doubts are removed, śrāvakas become Buddhas; all are [6] led to cessation by the Tathāgata’s extinction, like ghee arising from cooked butter[^141]. This is the emergence of the Great Nirvāṇa[^28] from Mahāprajñā, the fifth flavor.  
The four great disciples deeply grasped the Buddha’s intent, probing and receiving the one conversion as the teaching of the five flavors; beginning and end in sequence, the text emerges here.

</div>
<div class="english-translation">
The text on receiving the household business[7] has two: (1) mutual trust in essence, (2) being commanded to receive the business. Within trust there are again two: first it clarifies the trust; second it still abides in the original position. Now, first, “mutual trust” means mutual trust: in the Tripiṭaka[^109] one attains the wage of nirvāṇa[^28]—this is already not false; now for bodhisattvas[^68] he speaks this Mahāyāna[^69], which is also not false—this is the son trusting the father. The Buddha knows these have already cut off view‑ and thought‑delusions[^82]; on hearing they will surely not slander. Their undefiled faculties are sharp; on hearing, faith arises slightly—this is the father trusting the son. From this they see the honored/superior body and hear the Mahāyāna teaching—this is called “entering.” Again, being reproached and refuted, they still see the sixteen‑foot body[^26] speaking the Small Vehicle[^73] Dharma—this is called “exiting.” Thus in great and small they enter and exit without doubt or difficulty. Second, “yet his dwelling still remained in the original place” means: although entering and exiting without difficulty and hearing the Mahāyāna, they consider it the bodhisattvas’ affair and not their own share of wisdom; they do not turn from the small toward the great, still abiding as arhats and not saying that in the future they will become Buddhas. This receives the *Mahāsamnipāta*[^135] and *Vimalakīrti*[^136]—the fresh‑butter teaching. From “At that time the World‑Honored One, the elder, was ill” downward is the second, entrusting the household business; this receives the *Mahāprajñā*[^137], the Buddha’s command to transmit *Prajñā*[^137]—the cooked‑butter teaching.[^141] Here there are two: (1) command to know the household affairs, (2) receiving the command and knowing. Each chapter has four. The first four are: (1) clarify the time, (2) properly command knowing the household affairs, (3) admonish to embody my mind, (4) command not to let anything leak or be lost. First, “will die before long” means: when there is capacity one should respond as life; when capacity ends one should cease as death. Now the capacity for transformation is about to finish; the cessation is not far.  
Below “speaking to the poor son: I now have much,” second, is the command to know the household affairs. “Gold” is the principle of the Distinct Teaching[^41]; “silver” is the principle of the Shared Teaching. The true truth clarified in the *Mahāprajñā* does not go beyond these two, yet it says “much”—the principle is not many, but in terms of various gates it may be called many; for example, emptiness is not eighteen, but in terms of breaking the eighteen dharmas it is called the eighteen emptinesses. In the encouragement to study it clarifies that all Dharma‑gates are jewels. “Granary” is the samādhi gate, namely the 108 samādhis; “treasury” is the wisdom gate, the realm of the eighteen emptinesses. The two kinds of samādhi and wisdom, shared and distinct, are granaries and treasuries that store all dhyāna and wisdom without lack; internally full and externally overflowing, therefore it is called “overflowing.” “How much within it” means: speaking of prajñā, there are two gates, broad and brief. When bodhisattvas practice prajñā, they should know the brief and broad aspects: brief is little, broad is much; self‑practice is “taking,” transforming others is “giving.” The *Mahāprajñā* says “You should speak for bodhisattvas,” therefore it says “you should know it all.”[1]  
Below “my mind is thus,” third, is the admonition to embody. “My mind” means: the Buddha takes prajñā as mind; you now transmit the lamp and should speak in accordance with the Buddha’s intent. Moreover, the two‑vehicle people[^10] originally understand analytic emptiness; commanding them to embody this meaning is the command to turn the teaching and, by admonition, make them share my embodiment of analytic emptiness.[2] Formerly, when commanded, they thought it meant transmitting the lamp to others; now they know the Buddha commands me to recognize the gate of embodiment; therefore it says “you should embody this meaning.”  
As for “now I and you are not different,” this is explained in three ways: (1) being empowered to speak, one is not different from the Buddha; (2) in principle, because all dharmas are suchness, one is not different—Subhūti’s suchness and the Tathāgata’s suchness are one suchness, not two, therefore “not different”; (3) in the present time, they first awaken that father and son are originally not different, while two‑vehicle people merely thought they were different because of being empowered. Below “you should apply your mind,” fourth, is the command not to let anything leak or be lost. You speak the prajñā teaching for bodhisattvas—do not let it leak or be lost. Second, in principle this is the Dharma you will use later; therefore do not let it be lost.  
Below “then he received the instruction and command,” second, is receiving the command. Again there are four: (1) properly receiving the command and knowing it; (2) no hope of taking—although Subhūti speaks prajñā, he regards it as not his share; (3) not yet abandoning the inferior mind and still abiding in the original place: abiding in the arhat position, though he admires the great, he has not yet decisively said he wants to be a bodhisattva; not yet abandoning the inferior mind, though ashamed of the small, he has not yet decisively said he will abandon small realization; (4) below “after a short time, the father knew the son’s intent,” this receives the above parable of requesting the cart—despising the former mind, the desire to seek the Great Way arises, the great capacity is activated.

Question:

When is it called “a short time”?

Answer:

One says: when the *Prajñā*[^137] teaching is finished, traveling and contemplating elsewhere, one reflects on the Mahāyāna[^69] Dharma‑gates received and gives rise to a mind of delight—whether lost or not lost; such reflection is precisely the time when Mahāyāna capacity arises. At this time it is not far from the *Lotus*[^142], therefore it is called “a short time.”[3]  
Also, when the *Infinite Meanings* is about to be spoken, Mahāyāna capacity arises. How is this known? In the *Infinite Meanings* it clarifies seven kinds of expedients; the immeasurable gradual and sudden arise from one dharma. Having heard this, they reflect that the former Tripiṭaka[^109] three vehicles[^76] all arise from one dharma; thus the three vehicles should also enter the one. When reflecting in this way, the mind gradually becomes open and at ease[^134] and the great aspiration arises; therefore it is said “accomplishing the great aspiration.”

「諸君當知」下，第三，結會父子。實從我受學，實是我子；從我起解，是我所生。我實曾於二萬億佛所[6]甞教大法，故我實是父。「於某城中」者，此經西國文多，度此甚少，或可說昔名字國土如大通智勝因緣，今簡略名字直言某甲。是諸眾生背此大乘，起無明闇遁入生死，故[7]言「捨吾逃走」。備經六趣，故云「五十餘年」。「昔在本城懷憂推覓」，自昔法身地中，常以二智觀覓可化之機也。始於今日感應道交，故云「忽於是間會遇見之」。

Below “approaching the end,” second, this is the proper entrusting of the household business. Again it is two: [5] namely (1) entrusting the business, (2) rejoicing. The first has four: (1) time of entrusting the business, (2) commanding the son to gather the assembly as witnesses, (3) uniting father and son, (4) properly entrusting the household business. First, the time of entrusting: “approaching the end” clarifies the time. The conditions for transformation are about to be completed; on Vulture Peak he taught the *Lotus Sūtra*[^142] for eight years and announced entering nirvāṇa[^28].  
Below “and he commanded his son,” second, is gathering the assembly: namely, those transformed under the two‑myriad‑koṭi Buddhas are called sons; those of great capacity, fully matured, gather like clouds from the ten directions. This corresponds to the four assemblies surrounding above.  
As for “and he assembled the relatives,” old explanations say: emanation bodies are like relatives; the ten bhūmis[^31] are like kings; the ninth bhūmi like great ministers; the eighth bhūmi like kṣatriyas[^21]; the seventh bhūmi like householders. Northern interpreters take emanations as relatives, Many‑Treasures as the king; the ten bhūmis as great ministers; the eighth bhūmi as kṣatriyas; the thirty minds[^33] as householders. If so, in the trace‑gate teaching, the emanations and Many‑Treasures have not yet appeared—how can one point to them here? That explanation says: it is precisely when Śāriputra harbors doubt and cannot yet give rise to faith in the *Lotus* that Many‑Treasures and the emanations come at once to certify. If doubts are removed and understanding and prediction are already complete, what need is there for Many‑Treasures to certify? Therefore one knows that at the time of Dharma exposition Many‑Treasures had already appeared; but those who transmitted the text did not repeat it and placed it in sequence after the causes‑and‑conditions section. Now we say this is human conjecture and cannot be relied upon. For near matters of the trace‑gate there is no need for ancient proofs; for far matters of the fundamental gate one must first certify the past. Now we do not use that explanation; we rely on the *Sa‑yun Sūtra* (etc.).  
Now it clarifies: the Dharma‑body[^8] bodhisattvas of the ten directions, as “influencing” companions, are the relatives. This multitude of influence are Shakyamuni’s former co‑practitioners who, together with the Tathāgata, were taught under the two‑myriad‑koṭi Buddhas; among them all are in the role of uncles, therefore they are used as “relatives.”  
As for “kings”: among all gradual and sudden sūtras, each calls the place of what it explicates the sūtra‑king. According to the audience’s benefit, they rise and fall in time; each section is different and is called a “country”; all that are called first are kings. Moreover, this sūtra harmonizes all teachings—how could it not be the gathering of kings? Therefore in the *Infinite Meanings* it was already gathered earlier; it says: “First he taught the Four Truths and twelve links of dependent arising; next he taught Vaipulya and the twelve divisions of the canon; next he taught the Great Prajñā and the Avataṃsaka’s ocean of emptiness.” This universally gathers the sūtras, harmonizing gradual and sudden and assembling them into this text; therefore it is called “the gathering of kings.”  
Maitreya and other great bodhisattvas are all equal‑awakening[^29] and are great ministers. From the first bhūmi to the ninth bhūmi they are kṣatriyas, born in the lineage of the Dharma‑King. The thirty minds are householders. All these are transformed by Shakyamuni.  
Below “Gentlemen, you should know,” third, is uniting father and son: truly receiving learning from me, they are truly my sons; understanding arises from me, they are born from me. I truly once taught the great Dharma at the two‑myriad‑koṭi Buddhas[6]; therefore I truly am the father.  
As for “in a certain city,” the Indian version has much detail, but little was transmitted here; perhaps it is a former named land like the causes and conditions of Great‑Universal‑Wisdom‑Excellence. Now the name is abbreviated and simply said as “so‑and‑so.” These beings turned their backs on the Mahāyāna, aroused the darkness of ignorance, and fled into birth and death; therefore it says “left me and ran away.”[7] Having passed through the six destinies, therefore it says “more than fifty years.” “Formerly in the original city, grieving and searching”: from long ago, in the Dharma‑body ground, he constantly used the two wisdoms to observe and seek the capacities that could be transformed. Beginning today the path of stimulus and response meets, therefore it says “suddenly in this place he met and saw him.”

「今我所有」下，第四，正付家業。一切大乘萬行萬德，故云一切所有也。「先所出內是子所知」者，追指昔日《大品》領教所委有廣略般若共不共法，是汝所知即是汝有，故《法華》但明佛之知見，不更廣說一切行相也。「[1]窮子聞父此言」下，第二，即是得付歡喜，領上各乘大車得未曾有，自顧無心希望佛道，而今忽聞得記作佛，故云不求自得也。三藏中本心不求，方等中恥小望絕故不求，般若中雖領非己分故不求，如此不求而今自得也。「世尊大富長者」下，第二，合譬。光宅合之或前或後，釋之甚略。今但依文點意不復子派。合譬略者，貴在得意不俟費辭。「大富長者」，合父子相失譬。譬文有四，但合父子總得餘意，如來合父，似則合子。似有二義：一、取大機為子，昔未逃逝既非真位，猶居外凡故云似也；取小機為子者，小機似像大乘根性耳。子既逃父，貶之言似(云云)。

<div class="english-translation">
Below “Now all that I have,” fourth, is the proper entrusting of the household business. All the myriad practices and virtues of Mahāyāna[^69] are therefore called “all that I have.” “What had previously gone out and in is known by the son” points back to the former reception of the *Mahāprajñā*[^137] teaching, entrusted with broad and brief prajñā, shared and unshared dharmas: what you know is what you have. Therefore the *Lotus*[^142] only clarifies the Buddha’s knowledge‑and‑vision and does not further expound all modes of practice.  
Below “[1] the poor son heard his father’s words,” second, this is the joy of receiving the entrustment, corresponding above to each vehicle receiving the great cart and obtaining what was never before. Looking back, he had no mind to hope for the Buddha‑way, and now suddenly hears the prediction of Buddhahood—therefore it says “not seeking yet self‑obtained.” In the Tripiṭaka[^109] his original mind did not seek; in Vaipulya he was ashamed of the small and hope was cut off, so he did not seek; in prajñā, though he received, it was not his share, so he did not seek—thus not seeking and yet now self‑obtained.  
Below “World‑Honored One, great wealthy elder,” second, is the combined parable. Guangzhai combines it either before or after and explains it very briefly. Now we only follow the text to indicate the meaning and do not branch into sub‑schools. When combining the parable, the value is in grasping the meaning without verbose wording. “Great wealthy elder” combines the parable of father and son being separated. The parable text has four, but it only combines father and son to obtain the other meaning: the Tathāgata combines as the father; “semblance” combines as the son. “Semblance” has two meanings: (1) taking great capacity as the son—formerly he had not escaped, thus not yet a true stage, still outside ordinary, therefore called “semblance”; (2) taking small capacity as the son—small capacity is only a likeness of Mahāyāna roots. Since the son already fled the father, he is depreciated as “semblance.” (etc.).

Question:

The first explanation of the chapter says they have already entered the real—why does this say “semblance”?

This combines the time when the son fled the father; therefore it says “semblance.” The beginning of the chapter clarifies the son’s awakening—your question is not about that.

From “The Tathāgata always says we are sons” downward, it combines the parable of father and son meeting, but only combines that the elder sees the son and immediately recognizes him. From “Because we were afflicted by the three sufferings” downward, it combines the parable of chasing and luring. Above there are two lures—bystander and pursuing; now the combination is also two. Above, first he sends the bystander to chase, second he chases again, third he lets go; now it combines the two gates of no capacity. “When we were seen and caught we thought ourselves innocent” combines the lack of great capacity; “delighting in small dharmas” combines having a small aspiration and does not combine the letting‑go.  
From “Today, World‑Honored One, you have enabled us” downward, it combines the two lures. Above there is equal‑teaching reception and probing reception; now it combines both meanings. From “clearing away” downward, it combines the equal‑teaching, fully stating the above matter. From “we in the midst diligently strive” downward, it combines the above “immediately had them remove the dung.” “Attaining nirvāṇa” combines the above “first took his wage.”  
From “Yet the World‑Honored One previously knew us” downward, it combines the probing reception. Above the parable has four; now it combines three, not combining “properly teaching the work,” pointing to the above diligent removal of dung as already including it. Above it said “seeing from afar,” now “previously knew”; above “emaciated and haggard,” now “mind attached to base desires”; above “immediately removed the necklaces and put on coarse and shabby,” now “thus [2] saw abandoning, not making distinctions for a share of the treasure‑store.”  
From “With expedient power he speaks the Tathāgata’s wisdom” downward, it combines the parable of entrusting the household business. Above there are cause and entrusting; now it combines both. The cause has two: (1) mutual trust, (2) entrusting the business; now it combines both.  
First, mutual trust has two: first it combines the essence‑trust. “With expedient [3] power he speaks the Tathāgata’s wisdom”: old explanations said it is the cause of Tathāgata‑wisdom, held as the two‑vehicle fruit. Now it clarifies: bringing the three‑vehicle[^76] expedients, he speaks the Mahāyāna[^69] real aspect[^143]; therefore he says, by expedient power he speaks the Mahāyāna Dharma before us. This also combines “entering and exiting without difficulty”: by expedient power he exits, discriminating the two vehicles[^10]; by Buddha‑wisdom he enters, clarifying the real aspect. If there were no essence‑trust, how could he clarify the Buddha‑wisdom before us?  
From “We obtained from the Buddha the wage of one day’s nirvāṇa” downward, it combines still abiding in the original place.  
From “We also because of the Tathāgata’s wisdom” downward, it combines receiving the household business. Above there is command and receiving; now it only combines receiving. Receiving has four: (1) receiving the command, (2) no hope of taking, (3) not abandoning the inferior, (4) gradual openness; now it only combines two. First it combines receiving the command and receiving the business. Below “and of ourselves in this…” it combines no hope of taking and the other items. “No aspiration” clarifies that the Buddha adds power so one speaks as if with the Buddha‑mind; therefore we have no aspiration. “Therefore” explains the no‑hope‑of‑taking: by expedient power, following the small‑vehicle mind, he said there is no share; thus we did not know we are truly Buddha‑sons, therefore we did not take. “The Buddha by expedient power spoke in accord with us” means: the Buddha, bearing expedient power, spoke real‑aspect Dharma together with the two vehicles; we did not recognize the unshared meaning, therefore we were not [aware of being] Buddha‑sons.  
From “Now we for the first time know” downward, it combines the entrusting of the household business. Above there are two: entrusting and rejoicing; now it combines both. Above the entrusting has four; now it broadly combines the entrusting. [4] The entrusting has two: (1) clarifying that the Buddha originally is not stingy with the great, (2) explaining that the lack of stinginess is precisely because he delighted in the small and thus did not give the great early. In this sūtra, [5] below uses the present to verify the past: now the principle is only one, therefore we know the former three were not real; only because beings were not yet capable, therefore before the great he vilified the small mind, wishing them to abandon the false and take the true—thus we know he was not stingy. Yet the Buddha in truth teaches with the Mahāyāna.  
From “We say originally we had no mind” downward, it combines rejoicing, which also means “not seeking” in the three [vehicles].

These eighty‑six and a half lines of verses: the first seventy‑three and a half lines praise the above; the next thirteen lines praise the Buddha’s deep kindness. The first again has two: the first two lines praise the Dharma explanation; the latter seventy‑one and a half lines praise the parable explanation. In the Dharma explanation it does not praise “not seeking” but only praises self‑attainment. The parable explanation again has two: the first forty‑one verses praise opening the parable; the next thirty and a half verses praise the combined parable. Above, the opening has four: father and son lose each other, meet, entrust the business, and give the wealth; now all are praised. The first thirteen lines praise father and son losing each other. Above, the loss parable has four: (1) the son turns his back on the father, (2) the father seeks the son, (3) the son gradually returns, (4) the father thinks of the son. Now the verses also have four, but not in order. First, one and a half lines praise the first: the son turns his back on the father and leaves. Next, the second: seven lines praise the [6] second—the father seeks the son and cannot obtain him. Next, the third: two lines skip‑praise the fourth, the worry deepening. Next, the fourth: two and a half lines trace‑praise the third, the gradual return and drawing near the father. The above four passages each have two. Now first, below “譬如” one and a half lines only praise the son turning his back on the father and leaving, not praising going toward the country and returning. In the burning‑house, it clearly says the elder rules countries, towns, and villages, with broad wording; here it clarifies that the poor son’s cycling through the three realms are named “various countries,” and the six destinies are named “fifty‑plus years.”  
Below “其父憂念,” second, seven lines, this praises the father seeking the son and not obtaining. Above also has two; now the verses also have two. The first half line praises seeking [7] the son and not obtaining. Below “求之既疲” six and a half verses praise not abandoning the household business because of losing one son. “Four directions seeking” is not the same as above: above, four directions is reasoning by the four noble truths; now four directions is observing among the four births to seek a capacity that can be saved. “Building a house” is the remainder nirvāṇa in the remainder country; he raises a house of compassion, relying on a house of nature‑emptiness. “Many coming and going” are bodhisattvas of the various lands coming and going to hear the Dharma.  
Below “and his years were old,” third, two lines, skip‑praise the fourth, the worry deepening. The above text has two; here it only praises first losing the son; now he suffers having no one to entrust, therefore he worries.  
Below “At that time the poor son sought clothing and food,” fourth, two and a half lines, trace‑praise the third, the gradual return toward the father. Above text has two; now the verses also have two. The first two lines praise the cause of being near the father, because he sought clothing and food. Below “gradually passing through,” half line praises actually nearing the father’s city. First the cause of nearing the father is in the middle. “From town to town” means roots and dusts [8] intersect like “town”; the eighteen realms are like “country.” Cultivating conditioned good is like “with attainment”; cultivating the two‑vehicle good is like “without attainment.” Not obtaining Mahāyāna Dharma‑food is “hungry”; lacking great power is “weak”; lacking great merit is “emaciated”; on good and bad there arise views and thoughts as “sores and scabs.”  
From “hired laborer” down seven and a half verse lines praise the second: father and son meet. The above text has two; now the verses also have two. The first six and a half lines praise the son seeing the father; the next one line praises the father seeing the son. Above, the text of the son seeing the father has four; now the verses praise three: first half line praises the cause of seeing the father, because he was hired and thereby reached the father’s house. Next, below “At that time [1] the elder,” second, two and a half lines praise the third: the appearance when seeing the father. Above it made clear the place of seeing the father: the place was beside the gate; now it says “the elder within his gate,” which also obtains the place. “Setting up a great jeweled canopy,” etc, is precisely seeing the father’s appearance; the place is [2] seated on the lion seat. The Dharma‑body is the teacher and the king; the reward and response are the elder; “noting certificates and documents” is giving prediction, clarifying cultivation. Privately I say: using “notes” to reveal the broad and make it concise is “annotation”; granting a decision is “record”; the four vast vows are “certificates”; cultivation is “documents.” Below “the poor son sees the father,” three and a half lines praise the fourth: giving rise to a mind of fear and avoidance.  

Below “At that time the elder,” one line praises the second: the father sees the son. Above text has four: (1) seeing the place, (2) seeing and immediately recognizing, (3) seeing and rejoicing, (4) as wished. Now it only praises two: the upper half praises seeing the place; below “seeing from afar,” the second, half line, praises seeing the son and immediately recognizing.  
Below “Immediately ordered the messenger to chase and bring [him] back,” the third, ten and a half lines, praise the above parable of chasing and luring. Now first, three lines praise the bystander chase. Above, the text of the bystander chase has three: (1) call the son and he does not come, (2) call again and he does not come, (3) let go. Now the first three phrases praise the first calling with no capacity and he does not come; next, below “bewildered,” the second, one phrase, praises the second calling and he does not come; next, below “that person,” the third, two lines, praise no capacity, [3] which is the above explanation of letting‑go.  
Below “then by expedient means,” the second, seven and a half lines, praise secretly sending two men to lure and lead. Above text has two; now the verses also have two. The first three lines praise the parable of hiring for work; the next four and a half lines praise the parable of teaching to work. Above, the hiring‑for‑work text has four: (1) set up expedient means, (2) seek him and immediately obtain him, (3) state the hiring for work, (4) take the wage and remove the dung. Now it only praises two: the first two lines praise the first, setting up expedient means; below “the poor son heard this” one line praises the fourth, taking the wage and removing the dung.  
Now, in the first setting up expedients: “one eye” is partial emptiness; “short” is vertically short, not exhausting the source of real‑aspect; “ugly” is horizontally narrow, lacking the Mahāyāna’s many good adornments. Lacking the four fearlessnesses is called “no majesty”; lacking the extraordinary permanence, bliss, self, and purity is called “no virtue.” Next, below “the poor son heard this,” the second, taking the wage, is cleansing the six‑root rooms and the five‑aggregate house.  
Below “the elder at the window,” the second, four and a half lines, praise the above teaching‑to‑work. Above text has four; now the verses also have four. The first half line praises being in the window; below “thinking the son was foolish and inferior,” the second, half line, praises being weak and emaciated; below “thereupon the elder put on…” the third, one line, praises removing the fine and putting on the coarse; below “expediently drew near,” the fourth, two and a half lines, praises correctly teaching to work.  
Above there are seven categories of Dharma‑gates; “speaking” is [4] the four establishments of mindfulness; “order him to diligently work” is the four right efforts; below “and then increase your wage” one line praises the four bases of miraculous power; “oil‑smeared feet” means able to tread deep water like supernatural powers, and oil can remove wind, so samādhi is without disturbance; “food and drink sufficient” is the above rice and [＊7-1] flour; “thick [5] warm mats and bedding” are contemplating, training, perfuming, and cultivating samādhi that can remove scattering and agitation. “With such harsh words you should diligently work” half line generally praises the above fourth, comforting, and fifth, no five faults; only after roots and powers are accomplished can he bear harsh words. “And again with [6] soft words” half line generally praises the sixth, writing characters, and seventh, having him work constantly; both are the son stage.  
Below “the elder has wisdom,” the fourth, ten lines, praise the above fourth, receiving and entrusting the household business. Above text has two; now the verses also have two. Now the first three and a half lines praise the cause of entrusting the business; the next six and a half lines praise the actual entrusting. In the first cause there are two; now the verses also have two. First, below “the elder has wisdom” half line generally praises mutual trust in mind‑appearance; [7] this is entering and exiting. Below “after twenty years,” the second, three lines, praise entrusting and receiving the household business. Above, entrusting the business has command and receiving; now it only praises receiving the command. Above, receiving the command has four; now it only praises three. The first one and a half lines praise receiving the command; next, below “still dwelling by the gate,” the second, one line, praises still dwelling in the original position and not abandoning the inferior mind; next, below “the father knows the son’s mind,” the third, half line, praises opening and broadening the great aspiration and the great‑vehicle capacity moving.  
First, “twenty years” cannot be the same as above; above, removing view and thought is called twenty; here it clarifies taking charge of the household affairs. Some say it is turning to Mahāyāna teaching to teach bodhisattvas, cutting the Mahāyāna distinct delusions of view and thought, called twenty years. Some say the time of speaking prajñā is long, totaling twenty years. Some say abiding in the two‑vehicle position and turning to Mahāyāna teaching is twenty years. The *Renwang Prajñā* says, “For twenty‑eight years he preached Mahāprajñā.”  
From “wishing to give the wealth” downward, the second, six and a half lines praise the second: correctly entrusting the household business. Above text has two; now the verses also have two. The first four and a half lines praise correctly entrusting the business; the next two lines praise rejoicing in receiving the entrustment. Above, correctly entrusting the business has four; now it only praises three, without time‑sequence. First, below “wish to give” one line praises the above second, gathering the relatives. Below “in this great assembly,” second, with two and a half lines, praises the above third, settling the father‑son nature. Below “all that I have,” third, one line praises the above fourth, correctly entrusting and giving. Below “the son remembers former poverty,” the second, two lines, praise rejoicing in receiving the entrustment.  
From “the Buddha is also like this” downward, third, ten and a half verses, praise the combined parable. “The Buddha is also like this” combines the first father‑son loss; “knowing we delight in the small” one phrase combines the parable of father and son meeting; “never said” two phrases praise the combined third, the parable of chasing and calling. Above, the combination has two: (1) combining the second calling not coming, (2) combining letting go; now it only generally praises its meaning. Below “and saying that we…” one line praises the above combined parable of secretly sending two men to lure and lead. Above, it combines the equal teaching and probing teaching two chapters; now this one line only generally praises its meaning.  
Below “the Buddha ordered us,” twenty‑eight and a half lines, praise the combined fourth, receiving the household business. Above, the combination has two: mutual trust and entrusting; now the first eighteen and a half lines only praise the combined entrusting; the next ten lines praise the combined correct entrusting. Above, in receiving the command there are only two: receiving the command and no hope of taking; now the first one line long‑praises the command and knowing to receive; above had no “receiving.” “Supreme path” is just emptiness‑prajñā; there is nothing above it. Next, the following seventeen and a half lines correctly [8] receive the command and no‑hope‑of‑taking and so on; there is no not‑abandoning nor open‑broadening. “We accept the Buddha’s teaching” [9] has five lines, praising [10] correct receiving of the command. That Buddha‑sons hear the Dharma and obtain prediction clarifies turning the teaching to benefit others. “At that time” means turning the teaching, teaching bodhisattvas; it does not speak as for oneself.  
Below “like that poor son,” twelve and a half lines, praise the second, no hope of taking; this passage is expansive of the above. Within it are again two: the first one line repeats the prior parable and adheres to the combination; next, below “although we say,” the second, eleven and a half lines, correctly combine no hope of taking, and again there are three: first one line correctly praises no hope of taking. Next, below “we internally extinguished,” nine and a half lines—because wisdom and cutting are complete, there is no hope of taking—and again there are three, namely heading, explanation, and conclusion. The first has two: first one line marks that because the cutting‑virtue is complete there is no hope of taking; next, below “if we hear,” the second, one line, marks that because the wisdom‑virtue is complete there is no hope of taking. Below “Therefore,” six lines, dual‑explain the wisdom and cutting two sections. Next, below “although we are,” third, one and a half lines, concludes and explains self‑no‑hope‑of‑taking. Next, below “the guide sees,” third, one line, clarifies that the Buddha sees and lets us go, combining no hope of taking.  
Below “like a rich elder,” ten lines, praise correctly entrusting the business. Above the combination has two: correctly entrusting the business and rejoicing in receiving the entrustment. Now the verses also have two: first three lines praise correctly entrusting; next seven lines praise obtaining [1] joy. In the first three lines, above generally combines correct entrusting; now it also generally praises it, but the first one and a half lines repeat the parable and adhere to the combination, and the next one and a half lines correctly praise the combination. Below “we today,” seven lines, praise the second, rejoicing in receiving the entrustment. “Attaining the path” means attaining the real‑aspect path. “Attaining the fruit” means obtaining a portion of the Mahāyāna‑training fruit. These two phrases clarify opening the Buddha’s knowledge. “In the unconditioned Dharma obtaining the pure eye”—these two phrases clarify opening the Buddha’s vision, seeing the principle of real aspect. Formerly, seeing the unconditioned did not fall into ordinary beings; today seeing the unconditioned does not fall into the two vehicles. Formerly the wisdom‑eye saw emptiness; now the pure eye sees the middle.  
“Holding [2] the precepts’ reward” means: formerly holding precepts and brahma‑conduct together revealed the unconditioned; the ash‑body and extinguished‑wisdom had no one to receive this reward. Today brahma‑conduct can obtain the unconditioned: this is the meaning of taking the fruit by the realizing cause; holding precepts is the meaning of the conditioning cause; the principle seen by the pure eye is the meaning of the proper cause. “We truly are śrāvakas” means it is the true Mahāyāna position. The ten faiths, with one sound pervading the three‑thousand worlds, are a semblance path, not true; entering the ten abodes is true. The true arhat has three meanings; here only the “worthy of offerings” meaning is raised. If one does not arise in transformation‑birth and kills the shared and distinct delusions, that is the meaning of non‑arising and slaying thieves; it can be the field of merit for the ten dharma‑realms—this is the meaning of worthy of offerings. Worthy of offerings and slaying thieves mutually illuminate [3] each other. The following thirteen lines praise the Buddha’s deep kindness, difficult to repay, as in the text.

### 2. Eulogy of the Buddha's Kindness (Lines 337)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
私謂「世尊大恩」者，一、佛始建慈悲，拔六道苦與四聖樂，普十法界入四弘中，此如來室恩。二、如來行菩薩道示教利喜，曾教我大乘，雖復中忘，智願不失，蓋如來室清涼溫煖，大慈與樂恩。三、眾生遭苦，視父而已，佛伺其宜如犢逐母，備行六度以利眾生，蓋如來室遮寒障熱，大悲拔苦恩。四、佛成道已，應受無為寂滅之樂，而隱其神德，用貧所樂法五戒十善，冷水灑面令得醒悟，蓋是佛衣遮貪欲熱恩。五、示老比丘像，方便附近與一日價，蓋是佛衣除見寒愛熱恩。六、過是已後，心相體信彈訶貶斥，令恥小慕大，[4]蓋佛衣遮醜陋恩。七、命領家業，金銀庫藏[5]皆悉令知，蓋是佛衣與我莊嚴恩。八、會親族、定父子、付以家業，無上寶聚不求自得，蓋如來座恩。九、十，既坐座已，身意泰然快得安隱，以佛道聲令一切聞，一切天人普於其中應受供養，蓋如來座令我具足，自行化他恩。世尊大恩，兩肩荷負所不能報，此之謂也。

<div class="english-translation">
Privately I say that “the World‑Honored One’s great kindness” is: (1) The Buddha first established compassion, pulled beings out of the suffering of the six destinies and gave them the joy of the four sages, universally bringing the ten dharma‑realms into the four vast vows; this is the kindness of the Tathāgata’s room. (2) The Tathāgata practiced the bodhisattva path, teaching, benefiting, and rejoicing; he once taught me Mahāyāna; although I later forgot, wisdom and vows were not lost; this is the Tathāgata’s room’s cool warmth, the great‑compassion giving‑joy kindness. (3) When beings encounter suffering, they only look to a father; the Buddha watches what is appropriate, like a calf following its mother, fully practicing the six perfections to benefit beings; this is the Tathāgata’s room shielding cold and blocking heat, the great‑compassion pulling‑out‑suffering kindness. (4) After the Buddha attained the path, he should receive the joy of unconditioned quiescent extinction, yet he concealed his spiritual virtue, using the poor man’s liked Dharma of five precepts and ten good deeds; with cold water he sprinkled the face to awaken him—this is the Buddha’s clothing shielding the heat of greed and desire. (5) He manifested as an old bhikṣu, expediently drawing near and giving a day’s wage—this is the Buddha’s clothing removing the cold of views and the heat of craving. (6) After this, with mutual trust of mind‑appearance he admonished and depreciated, making him ashamed of the small and yearning for the great; [4] this is the Buddha’s clothing shielding ugliness. (7) He ordered the son to manage the household business; the gold and silver treasury [5] he let him all know; this is the Buddha’s clothing giving me adornment kindness. (8) He gathered relatives, fixed the father‑son relation, and entrusted the household business; the unsurpassed treasure‑mass is obtained without seeking; this is the Tathāgata’s seat kindness. (9) and (10): once seated on the seat, body and mind are tranquil and quickly obtain peace and security; with the Buddha‑way’s sound he causes all to hear; all devas and humans universally therein should receive offerings—this is the Tathāgata’s seat enabling me to be complete, the kindness of self‑practice and transforming others. The World‑Honored One’s great kindness cannot be repaid even with two shoulders bearing; this is what is meant.
