釋藥草喻品 (Line 18)
此中具山川雲雨，獨以「藥草」標名者，土地是能生，雲雨是能潤，草木是所生所潤，所生所潤通皆有用，而藥草用強，有漏諸善悉能除惡，無漏為最，無漏眾中四大弟子，以譬領佛譬深會聖心，佛讚善哉甚為希有，述其得解以喻其人，故稱「藥草喻品」。夫藥草叢育日久，一蒙雲雨扶疏暐曄，芽莖豐蔚於外，力用充潤於內，譬諸無漏住最後身有餘涅槃，更不願求無上佛道；今得聞經自乘佛乘兼以運人，文云「我等今日真是聲聞」，以佛道聲令一切聞，內外自他具勝力用，故稱「藥草喻品」。夫藥草者，能除四大風冷，補養五臟還年駐色，今蒙雲雨忽成藥王，餌之遍治眾病變體成仙，譬諸無漏聞經，破無明惑開佛知見，文云「我等今日真是佛子，無上寶聚不求自得」，佛子所應得者皆已得之，面於佛前得受記莂，嘉著而稱微，故言「藥草喻品」。

<div class="english-translation">
**Explanation of the Medicinal Herbs Parable Chapter:**<br>
In this parable, Mountains, Rivers, Clouds, and Rain are all present. Why is it titled solely "**Medicinal Herbs**" (*Yào Cǎo*)?<br>
*   **The Land:** Is the "Able to Produce" (*Néng Shēng*).<br>
*   **Clouds and Rain:** Are the "Able to Moisten" (*Néng Rùn*).<br>
*   **Grasses and Trees:** Are "What is Produced and Moistened" (*Suǒ Shēng Suǒ Rùn*).<br>
What is produced and moistened generally all have utility, but the utility of **Medicinal Herbs** is strong. All "Leaking Goodness" (*Yǒu Lòu Zhū Shàn*) can eliminate evil, but "Non-Leaking" (*Wú Lòu*) is the supreme.<br>
Among the non-leaking assembly, the Four Great Disciples used a parable to understand the Buddha's parable, deeply according with the Sage's Mind (*Shèng Xīn*). The Buddha praised them saying "Excellent!" (*Shàn Zāi*) and "Very rare." He narrates their attainment of understanding by using a parable for *these people* [the Disciples]. Therefore, it is called the "Medicinal Herbs Parable Chapter."<br>
<br>
**The Metaphor of Growth:**<br>
Medicinal herbs grow in clusters for a long time. Once receiving the cloud and rain, they spread and flourish outwardly, and their powerful utility fills and moistens them inwardly.<br>
*   **Matching the Non-Leaking Ones:** This metaphors the Non-Leaking Ones dwelling in the "Last Body" (*Zuì Hòu Shēn*) of Remainder Nirvana. Formerly, they did not wish to seek the Unsurpassed Buddha Way.<br>
*   **Current Benefit:** Now, gaining the hearing of this Sutra, they self-ride the Buddha Vehicle and concurrently transport others.<br>
*   **Text Quote:** "We today are truly Sravakas (Voice Hearers), causing everything to hear the Buddha Path Voice."<br>
*   **Conclusion:** Internally and externally, for self and others, they possess superior powerful utility. Thus, it is called "Medicinal Herbs Parable."<br>
<br>
**The Metaphor of Curing:**<br>
Medicinal herbs can remove the "Four Great Elements" (*Sì Dà*) wind and cold, nourish the Five Organs, return youth, and halt aging.<br>
*   **Medicine King:** Now, receiving the Cloud and Rain, they suddenly become "Medicine Kings" (*Yào Wáng*). Taking them universally cures all sicknesses and transforms the body into an Immortal (*Xiān*).<br>
*   **Matching the Meaning:** This metaphors the Non-Leaking Ones hearing the Sutra, destroying Ignorance Delusions (*Pò Wú Míng Huò*), and opening Buddha Knowledge and Vision.<br>
*   **Text Quote:** "We today are true Sons of the Buddha; the Unsurpassed Jewel Cluster, sought not, is self-obtained."<br>
*   **Prediction:** The Sons of the Buddha obtained what they should obtain. Face-to-face with the Buddha, they obtain the Prediction (*Shòu Jì Bié*). Their merit is manifest, yet they are named "Subtle" [Herbs]—thus "Medicinal Herbs Parable."

### 2. Chapter Structure and The Three Siddhāntas (Lines 26-27)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
前一番是師弟領述，世界悉檀意也；次一番生善，為人意也；次一番是對治、第一義兩悉檀意也。是名「因緣釋品」。餘約教、本迹、觀心，準例可知，不復記(云云)。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**"First Round" (*Qián Yī Fān*):** This is the Disciples narrating their understanding. This is the **Worldly Siddhānta** intent (Joy).<br>
**"Next Round" (*Cì Yī Fān*):** Generating Goodness. This is the **For-The-Person Siddhānta** intent.<br>
**"Next Round" (*Cì Yī Fān*):** Counteracting and Supreme Truth. This is the **Counteracting** and **First Principle Siddhānta** intent.<br>
This is named the "Causes and Conditions Explanation of the Chapter." The rest—Teaching, Origin/Trace, Observing the Mind—can be known by standard example and are not recorded here.

</div>

### 3. Detailed Explanation: Approving the Disciples (Lines 27-38)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
此品是譬說中第三述成段。舊云：述其十三偈歎佛恩深，又述其教作人譬文言曲巧。師云：不應偏爾，經稱善說如來真實功德，備述其領權領實，明文在此；十三偈止是二乘齊教荷恩，教作人譬是佛權功德耳。今言都述其周遍領解，始天性結緣、中間追誘、終於付財，自微自著無量無邊諸恩德也。其文為二：一、略述成，二、廣述成。略述又二：一、雙述善哉，二、領所不及。雙述者，一善哉述其兩處領實，一善哉述其兩處領權。「善說如來真實功德」者，「真實」是述實，「功德」是述權。又《華嚴》之擬宜領實也，三藏之誘引領權也，方等之體信，《般若》之領教，俱領權實也，《法華》之付財，專論實也。辭致曲巧故言「善說」，皆是佛法故言「真實」。「誠如所言」者，印定之旨也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
This chapter is the **Third Section** of the "Parable Cycle" (Metaphorical Exposition): The **Narrative of Approval/Confirmation** (*Shù Chéng Duàn*).<br>
*   **Old Interpretation (*Jiù Yún*):** Says it approves the 13 Verses praising Buddha's kindness, and furthermore approves the Teaching's "Destitute Son Parable" text as being crookedly skillful.<br>
*   **Master's [Zhiyi's] Critique (*Shī Yún*):** One should not be partial like that. The Sutra praises "Well spoken, the Tathagata's Real Merit." It fully narrates their understanding of Provisional (*Quán*) and Real (*Shí*). The clear text is here; the 13 Verses only represent the Two Vehicles determining the Teaching and bearing gratitude. The Teaching's "Destitute Son Parable" is only the Buddha's Provisional merit.<br>
*   **Current Interpretation (*Jīn Yán*):** It wholly narrates their **All-Pervasive Understanding** (*Zhōu Biàn Lǐng Jiě*). Beginning with the "Nature/Bonding of Conditions" (*Tiān Xìng Jié Yuán*), in the Middle "Pursuing and Luring" (*Zhuī Yòu*), and Finally "Bestowing the Wealth" (*Fù Cái*). From the subtle to the manifest, receiving the infinite and boundless merits of grace.<br>
**Textual Division:** The text is divided into two: 1. **Brief Approval** (*Lüè Shù Chéng*), 2. **Broad Approval** (*Guǎng Shù Chéng*).<br>
**1. Brief Approval:** Also two parts: 1. Doubly narrating "Excellent" (*Shàn Zāi*); 2. Narrating What Was Not Reached.<br>
*   **Double Excellent:** One "Excellent" narrates their understanding of the Real in two places; One "Excellent" narrates their understanding of the Provisional in two places.<br>
*   **"Well Spoken the Tathagata's Real Merit":**<br>
    *   **"Real" (*Zhēn Shí*):** Approves the Real (Avatamsaka/Lotus).<br>
    *   **"Merit" (*Gōng Dé*):** Approves the Provisional (Tripitaka/Agama).<br>
*   **Approved Understandings:**<br>
    *   *Avatamsaka:* "Intended Fitting" (*Nǐ Yí*) - Approves Understanding Real.<br>
    *   *Tripitaka:* "Luring/Guiding" - Approves Understanding Provisional.<br>
    *   *Vaipulya:* "Mutual Trust" - Approves Both.<br>
    *   *Prajna:* "Managing Instructions" - Approves Both.<br>
    *   *Lotus:* "Bestowing Wealth" - Exclusively Real.<br>
*   **"Well Spoken":** Because the phrasing is crooked and skillful (*Qū Qiǎo*).<br>
*   **"Real":** Because all are Buddha Dharma.<br>
*   **"Truly as you have said":** This is the purport of Certification/Sealing (*Yìn Dìng*).

### 4. What the Disciples Missed (Lines 38-48)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
又從「如來復有」下，述其領所不及。云何不及？謂退進、橫豎、亦橫亦豎、非橫非豎皆不及也。所以者何？大雲普覆遍荷清涼，大雨俱霑無不蒙澤，咸令世間皆得知見未曾有法，那忽齊教止領二乘得益？不道人天小草，是為退所不及。菩薩名上草，亦名小樹大樹，敷榮欝茂自他饒益而復不領，是為進所不及。又十法界同成佛法界，那忽止領二乘，餘八法界都不涉言？是為橫所不及。又七方便從淺至深皆入真實，餘五方便都不在言，是為豎所不及。又三世利益未曾暫廢，是為亦橫亦豎所不及。夫山川谿谷(云云)，總言一地，一地能生未嘗揀擇攘彼受此，草木種子皆依於地更無餘依，一雲靉靆無處不密，一雨一味不隔枯榮，普潤既同普得增長，如來平等不可思議，實不先頓後漸、初三末一，如龍興慶雲普雨於一切身心不降雨除熱得清涼，是為五乘七方便十方三世平等廣大，甚深博遠不可思議無有差別，是為非橫非豎領所不及。不及之旨非都頓奪，特以初心望後心，未窮極地故云不盡耳。又初悟初阿，亦具後茶功德，但齊教之領未暇進領橫豎周遍耳。又權行大士宜應如此也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**From "The Tathagata also has" (*Rú Lái Fù Yǒu*):**<br>
This narrates what their understanding **did not reach** (*Lǐng Suǒ Bù Jí*). What did they not reach? Specifically, "Retreating and Advancing," "Horizontal and Vertical," "Both Horizontal and Vertical," and "Neither Horizontal Nor Vertical"—all were not reached.<br>
*   **Why is this?** (*Suǒ Yǐ Zhě Hé*):<br>
    *   The Great Cloud universally covers, everywhere bearing coolness. The Great Rain universally soaks, nothing is not Mongol to the moisture. This causes the entire world to obtain the knowledge and vision of the Unprecedented Law.<br>
    *   **Retreating (*Tuì*) Not Reached:** How could it suddenly equal the Teaching, stopping at the understanding of the Two Vehicles' gain? It does not speak of the Human and Heavenly "Small Grasses"; this is what the Retreating understanding did not reach. (They retreated to the middle and missed the lower).<br>
    *   **Advancing (*Jìn*) Not Reached:** The Bodhisattvas are named "Superior Grasses," and also named "Small Trees and Great Trees." Their spreading glory and dense luxuriance benefit self and others, yet [the Disciples] did not understand this; this is what the Advancing understanding did not reach.<br>
    *   **Horizontal (*Héng*) Not Reached:** Furthermore, the **Ten Dharma Realms** (*Shí Fǎ Jiè*) together accomplish the Buddha Dharma Realm. How could they stop at understanding only the Two Vehicles (Sravaka/Pratyeka), while the other Eight Dharma Realms are not involved in their words? This is "Horizontal" failing.<br>
    *   **Vertical (*Shù*) Not Reached:** Furthermore, the **Seven Expedients** (*Qī Fāng Biàn*) from shallow to deep all enter the Real. The other Five Expedients are not in their words; this is what the "Vertical" did not reach.<br>
    *   **Both Horizontal and Vertical Not Reached:** Furthermore, the benefit of the **Three Times** (Past, Present, Future) has never been temporarily abandoned; this is "Both Horizontal and Vertical" failing.<br>
    *   **The Ultimate Reality:** Now, the Mountains, Rivers, Streams, and Valleys generally speak of "One Ground." The One Ground is able to produce; it has never selected "rejecting that" or "accepting this." The Grass and Tree seeds all rely on the Ground; there is no other reliance. The "One Cloud" implies dense gathering; there is no place not dense. The "One Rain" is One Flavor; it does not separate the withered from the flourishing. The Universal Moisture is the same, and the Universal Attainment of Growth is the same.<br>
    *   The Tathagata's equality is inconceivable. Truly, it is not "First Sudden, Later Gradual," nor "Initial Three, Final One." Like a Dragon rousing the auspicious clouds, universally raining on all bodies and minds, descending rain, removing heat, and obtaining coolness.<br>
    *   **Neither Horizontal Nor Vertical (*Fēi Héng Fēi Shù*):** This is the Five Vehicles, Seven Expedients, Ten Directions, and Three Times—Equal, Vast, Great. Deep, Broad, Far-reaching, Inconceivable, having no discrimination. This is what the "Neither Horizontal Nor Vertical" understanding did not reach.<br>
    *   **The Purport:** This does not mean completely snatching/negating their understanding (*Fēi Dū Dùn Duó*). It is specially presenting the Initial Mind looking toward the Later Mind; because they have not exhausted the Ultimate Ground, it is said "does not exhaust" (*Bù Jìn*).<br>
    *   Also, the Initial Awakening and Initial Fruit (*A*) also possess the later Merit (*Cha*). But regarding the understanding of the Teaching, they did not have time to advance their understanding to the Horizontal and Vertical all-pervasiveness.<br>
    *   Moreover, the Great Knight of Provisional Practice (*Quán Xíng Dà Shì*) fittingly should be like this.<br>

### 5. Broad Approval: The Metaphors (Lines 48-50)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
廣述成又二：長行、偈頌。長行又二：初述成開三顯一，次從「汝等迦葉」下，結歎。初有法譬合。法中又二：初先舉法王者，不虛勸信也；次「於一切法」下，正述開三顯一。夫人王外無所畏、內不二言；法王亦爾，眾惡已盡、發言誠諦。舊云：述中根不虛，獎下根信受。今言：佛法雖多不出權實，權實之外更無別法，而言「無量」者，此意難信，故舉法王勸信，又為下大雲譬作本。從「於一切法」下，約教明開權顯實。從「如來觀知」下，約智明開權顯實。由二教顯二智，由二智說二教，智教相成也。「一切法」者，謂七方便，橫也；對一實，為豎也。若言不爾，何故二萬億佛所初發大心，中間取小，又流轉五趣，又十法界一人尚具，況七方便耶？此法雖多，方便波羅蜜照之罄無不盡，以隨其類音說之無不逗會，為人天說戒善，為二乘說諦緣，為三藏說事度，為通教說無生，為別教說次第開如來藏，是名述其領開三也。從「其所說法」下，約教述其顯實也。「地」者實相也。究竟非二故名「一」，其性廣博故名為「切」，寂而常照故名為「智」，無住之本立一切法故名為「地」，此圓教實說也。凡有所說皆令眾生到此智地，顯實之文灼然如日，云何闇寱作餘解耶？例《大品》廣歷諸法皆摩訶衍，衍即大乘，乘即實相，實相即一切智地，上文云「唯此一事實」指此地也，「餘二則非真」，指七方便也。此約漸頓二教，述其開權顯實也。從「如來觀知一切諸法」下，約智述開權顯實。「觀一切歸趣」，是能照權也；「究竟明了」者，能照實也，二智所照偏圓兩境通達無礙，故能說權實二教，此舉智釋教也。「知所歸趣」是識藥，「深心所行」是知病，病藥俱是權法，權法各有歸趣，戒善等近趣人天，若作緣義，低頭舉手遠趣佛果；念處道品等近趣涅槃，若作福德莊嚴，汝等所行是菩薩道遠趣寶所；乃至六度通、別等法，近遠歸趣途轍不同，可解。又戒善是人天藥，諦緣度是三乘人藥，乃至通、別等亦可解。「深心所行」有二種：深心著於依正，又深心著所執之法。著依正者，起深重十惡障人天乘；著所執法，起四倒三道六蔽四住五住等，障諸聖乘。當知深心病相不同，權智照之通達無礙。「又於諸法究盡明了」者，實智所照也。一切權法無不入實，故言「究竟」，實智所知故言「了」，佛眼所見故言「明」。若此智照此藥此病，不照彼藥彼病，彼智照彼不能照此，種別不同者，權智照也；一智遍照一切藥一切病，實智照也。能示眾生如此圓境智，故言「一切智慧」也。又「一切法」者，謂十法界也，十法各各相欲不同，各獲果報歸趣亦異。知諸法盡者名知病，知一切深心所著名知藥。藥有深淺，《大品》云「如實智知貪欲心瞋癡心」，以如實智知名知深心，如理通達無有障礙，若戒善、諦、緣、度等一切法藥，悉用如實智知者，名「通達無礙」。又權智文中通達無礙者，約權論實；實智文中，又於諸法諸法者，約實論權。二文亙現者，此明實是權實、權是實權，當知究竟非權非實，非差別非不差別，以智方便權有差別，悉到智地則無差別。如地無差別草木若干，若干無若干、無若干若干。又如約心論法、約法論心，心有諸數、法無諸數，心不離法、法不離心，無數而數、數而無數耳。權實亦爾(云云)。
110: 
111: 從「譬如」下，第二，譬說。文為二：初譬說，後復宗稱歎。譬有開、合。開為二：一、差別譬，譬上述權教權智；二、無差別譬，譬上述實教實智也。三草二木纖濃不等，故言差別；一地一雨普載普潤，故無差別。若觀其末派，謂各各不同；若究其根榮，莫非地雨。內合方便智照七五各異，實智往照終歸一實，一實七五、七五一實，差別無差別，無差別差別(云云)。差別譬有六：一、土地，二、卉木，三、密雲，四、注雨，五、受潤，六、增長。

<div class="english-translation">
**Broad Approval (*Guǎng Shù Chéng*):** divided into two: Prose and Verses. The Prose is also two: First, narrating the Approval of **Opening Three Revealing One**; Second, from "You Kasyapa" downwards, the concluding praise. First comes the Dharma, Parable, and Matching. Within the Dharma there are also two: First, initially raising the **Dharma King**, merely meaning exhorting faith without falsity; Second, from "Regarding all dharmas" downwards, properly narrating Opening Three Revealing One.<br>
*   **Dharma King Exhortation:** Now, a Human King has no fear outwardly and no two words [duplicity] inwardly; the Dharma King is also thus, having exhausted all evils, his words are sincere and true.
    *   *Old Interpretation:* Narrates that the Middle Root is not false, encouraging the Lower Root to believe and accept.
    *   *Current Interpretation:* Although the Buddha Dharma is manifold, it does not go beyond Provisional and Real. Outside of Provisional and Real, there is no other Dharma. But saying "Immeasurable" [meanings] is hard to believe, therefore he raises the Dharma King to exhort faith, and also to serve as the basis for the "Great Cloud" parable below.<br>
*   **Opening Three Revealing One (Teaching):** From "Regarding all dharmas" downwards, outlines **Opening the Provisional to Reveal the Real** (*Kāi Quàn Xiǎn Shí*) according to the **Teaching** (*Yuē Jiào*).<br>
*   **Opening Three Revealing One (Wisdom):** From "The Tathagata observes and knows" downwards, outlines Opening the Provisional to Reveal the Real according to **Wisdom** (*Yuē Zhì*).<br>
    *   From the Two Teachings, the Two Wisdoms are revealed; from the Two Wisdoms, the Two Teachings are spoken. Wisdom and Teaching complete each other.<br>
*   **"All Dharmas" (*Yī Qiè Fǎ*):** Refers to the **Seven Expedients** (*Qī Fāng Biàn*), which is Horizontal; contrasted with the **One Real** (*Yī Shí*), which is Vertical.<br>
    *   If this were not so, why would one initially give rise to the Great Mind at the place of 20,000 million Buddhas, then in the middle take the Small, and also transmigrate through the Five Destinations? Also, one person in the Ten Dharma Realms still possesses [the others], how much more so the Seven Expedients? Although this Dharma is manifold, the **Expedient Paramita** illuminates it completely without exhaustion.<br>
    *   Using the sounds according to their categories, speaking without failing to meet the capacity: for Humans/Heaven he speaks Precepts/Goodness; for the Two Vehicles he speaks Truths/Conditions; for the Tripitaka he speaks Six Degrees; for the Shared he speaks Non-Arising; for the Separate he speaks the Gradual Opening of the Tathagata Store. This is named narrating their understanding of **Opening the Three**.<br>
*   **Revealing the Real (Teaching):** From "The Dharma he speaks" downwards, narrates **Revealing the Real** according to the Teaching.<br>
    *   **"Ground" (*Dì*):** Is the Real Mark (*Shí Xiàng*). Ultimately not two, thus named "One." Its nature is broad and vast, thus named "All" (*Qiè*). Quiet yet constantly illuminating, thus named "Wisdom" (*Zhì*). The root of Non-Abiding establishes all dharmas, thus named "Ground." This is the Real Teaching of the Perfect Teaching.<br>
    *   Whatever is spoken causes living beings to arrive at this Wisdom Ground. The text Revealing the Real is blazing like the sun; how could one be obscured in sleep and make other interpretations? Just as the *Great Treatise* broadly traverses all dharmas as Mahayana; the Vehicle is the Real Mark, the Real Mark is the Ground of All-Wisdom. The previous text saying "Only this One Fact is Real" refers to this Ground; "The other two are not True" refers to the Seven Expedients. This narrates Opening the Provisional and Revealing the Real regarding the Sudden and Gradual Two Teachings.<br>
*   **Opening Three Revealing One (Wisdom):** From "The Tathagata observes and knows all dharmas" downwards, narrates it according to **Wisdom**.<br>
    *   **"Observing where all tend":** This is **Illuminating the Provisional**.<br>
    *   **"Ultimately understanding":** This is **Illuminating the Real**.<br>
    *   The Two Wisdoms illuminate the two realms of Partial and Perfect, penetrating without obstruction, therefore he can speak the Two Teachings of Provisional and Real. This raises Wisdom to explain the Teaching.<br>
*   **Medicine and Disease Parable:**<br>
    *   **"Knowing where they tend":** Is **Identifying the Medicine** (*Shí Yào*).<br>
    *   **"Deep mind practice":** Is **Knowing the Disease** (*Zhī Bìng*).<br>
    *   Disease and Medicine are both Provisional Dharmas (*Quán Fǎ*). Provisional Dharmas each have a tendency/destination. Precepts/Goodness tend toward Human/Heaven. If taken as the meaning of Conditions, lowering the head and raising the hand far tends toward the Buddha Fruit. Mindfulness Foundations and Path Grades near tend toward Nirvana; if taken as Blessing/Virtue Adornment, "what you practice is the Bodhisattva Path" far tends toward the Treasure Place. Even the Six Degrees, Shared, Separate, etc., their near and far tendencies are different tracks, which can be understood.<br>
*   **Deep Mind (*Shēn Xīn*):** Has two types: Deep Mind attached to Dependents/Orthodox (*Yī Zhèng*), and Deep Mind attached to the Held Dharma (*Suǒ Zhí Zhī Fǎ*).<br>
    *   Attached to Dependents/Orthodox: Arises deep/heavy Ten Evils, obstructing the Human/Heaven Vehicle.<br>
    *   Attached to Held Dharma: Arises Four Inversions, Three Paths, Six Coverings, Four Abodes, Five Abodes, etc., obstructing the various Sage Vehicles.<br>
    *   You should know the marks of the Deep Mind disease are different; Provisional Wisdom illuminates them penetratingly without obstruction.<br>
*   **"Also regarding all dharmas, ultimately understanding":** This is the illumination of **Real Wisdom**.<br>
    *   All Provisional Dharmas enter the Real without exception, thus "Ultimate." Known by Real Wisdom, thus "Understood" (*Liǎo*). Seen by the Buddha Eye, thus "Clear" (*Míng*).<br>
    *   If *this* wisdom illuminates *this* medicine/disease but not *that* medicine/disease, or *that* wisdom illuminates *that* but not *this*, the types are different; this is **Provisional Wisdom Illumination**.<br>
    *   One Wisdom universally illuminates *all* medicines and *all* diseases; this is **Real Wisdom Illumination**.<br>
    *   "Being able to show beings this Perfect Realm Wisdom is thus called 'All Wisdom/Sarvajna.'"
    *   **Matching the Grass/Tree Differentiation Parable (*Hé Cǎo Mù Chā Bié Pì*):**
        *   (As explained later, not re-recorded here).
        *   Sometimes matched with **Three Meanings**:
            1.  **Non-Differentiation Meaning:** Matches "One Ground, One Rain."
            2.  **Differentiation Meaning:** Matches "Grass/Tree Differentiation."
                *   "One Phase": Matches One Ground.
                *   "One Flavor": Matches One Rain.
            3.  **Tathagata Able to Know:** Explains the "Non-Differentiation of the Two Meanings." That is, "One Phase One Flavor"—One Phase matches One Ground.

        *   **Detailed Explanation (Source Line 80):**
            *   From **"The Tathagata knows this"** downwards is the Fourth, repeating the previous to summarize "Able to Know."
            *   **"One Phase, One Flavor,"** etc., as explained before.
            *   "One Phase, One Flavor, Liberation, Separation, Extinction": If analyzed as conditions (*Wéi Yuán Fēn Bié*), this is **Immeasurable amidst One**.
            *   **"Ultimately Nirvana, finally returning to Emptiness":** This is **One amidst Immeasurable**.
            *   This repeats the previous to re-explain Non-Differentiation. Why?
                *   If "One Phase, One Flavor, Liberation, Separation, Extinction" are taken as the Two Vehicles' Dharma Substance, they are still differentiated words.
                *   Now, making them "Great Vehicle Ultimate Nirvana finally returning to Emptiness," this unifies them as Non-Differentiation.
            *   **"Ultimate Nirvana":** Concludes that the previous phrases are *not* the Two Vehicles' Remainder/No-Remainder, but the Ultimate Nirvana.
            *   **"Permanent Extinction Aspect" (*Cháng Jí Miè Xiàng*):** Concludes the phrases are not Small Vehicle Extinction, but Permanently Abiding Extinction. (As the text says: "All Dharmas from the origin are constantly of the extinction aspect").
            *   **"Finally returning to Emptiness":** Not the Emptiness of Ash-Body/Extinguished-Knowledge ("Ash-Cut"), but the **Middle Way First Principle Emptiness**. This solemnly and strictly distinguishes the Real from the Provisional.
            *   *Critique of Old Views:* Old masters said "Finally returning to emptiness" meant that even after miracles/long life, one finally returns to Ash-Cut Emptiness. This is the "Suffering Buddha, Suffering Sutra" view. How can one say this?
            *   *Guangzhai's View:* "Finally returning to Remainder" (abandoning impermanent body/wisdom).
                *   *Critique:* If so, how is it different from Two Vehicles? The text raises two Ultimates:
                    1.  "Ultimately arriving at All-Seed Wisdom" (Wisdom Fruit vs. Two Vehicles).
                    2.  "Ultimately Nirvana returning to Emptiness" (Severance vs. Two Vehicles).
                *   The word "Ultimate" knows it is not Small Vehicle Emptiness.

        *   **Definitions:**
            *   **"Liberation Phase" (*Jiě Tuō Xiàng*):** No Birth/Death phase.
            *   **"Separation Phase" (*Lí Xiàng*):** No Nirvana phase.
            *   **"Extinction Phase" (*Miè Xiàng*):** No "Phase" and "No Non-Phase"; only Real Phase, thus called "One Phase." One Phase establishes all dharmas from the Non-Abiding Basis. Non-Abiding and Non-Phase is **Non-Differentiation**. Establishing all dharmas is **Differentiation**.
        *   **Analogy:**
            *   Differentiation is like **Grasses/Trees**. Non-differentiation is like **One Ground**.
            *   Although the Ground has no difference, it can produce differences like **Peaches, Plums, Grasses, Trees**.
            *   Although Peaches, Plums, Grasses, Trees differ, they are same in the **One Solidity Phase** (*Yī Jiān Xiàng*) of the Ground.
        *   **Application:**
            *   If knowing the Ground possesses Peaches/Plums, one recognizes the **Provisional within the Real** (*Shí Zhōng Yǒu Quán*). Understanding Non-Differentiation *is* Differentiation.
            *   If knowing the Peaches/Plums Solidity Phase, one recognizes the **Real within the Provisional** (*Quán Zhōng Yǒu Shí*). Understanding Differentiation *is* Non-Differentiation.
            *   For this meaning, "One Phase" matches the "One Ground" parable.
        *   **"One Flavor":** This is the Real Teaching, pure and unmixed; understood by the example of One Phase.
            *   "Liberation": No binding of Segmented or Mutable karmas.
            *   "Separation": Attaining Middle Way Wisdom; this wisdom separates from the Two Extremes without attachment.
            *   "Extinction": Causes of Two Extremes extinguished (Remainder Nirvana); Fruits of Two Extremes extinguished (No Remainder Nirvana).
            *   Sentence by sentence, apply the "Differentiation/Non-Differentiation" meaning; it can be understood by the standard of One Phase.
    *   **"Ultimately Arriving at All-Seed Wisdom":**
        *   If attaining the Extinction Phase of the Two Extremes, it is the exhaustion of Shared and Separate delusions, entering Buddha Knowledge and Vision. Using All-Seed Wisdom Mind to practice Prajna, the Initial and Ultimate are not different (*Chū Bì Èr Bù Bié*), thus "Ultimate." This is the Buddha's Wisdom, thus "All-Seed Wisdom."<br>
*   **"All Dharmas" as Ten Dharma Realms:** The "All Dharmas" refers to the Ten Dharma Realms. The ten dharmas each have different marks/desires, and each obtains fruit/retribution tendencies that are also different.<br>
    *   Knowing all dharmas exhaustively is named **Knowing the Disease**.<br>
    *   Knowing all deep mind attachments is named **Knowing the Medicine**.<br>
    *   Medicine has shallow and deep. The *Great Treatise* says: "Using 'As-Real Wisdom' (*Rú Shí Zhì*) to know the greedy mind, angry, foolish mind." Using As-Real Wisdom to know is named Knowing the Deep Mind. According to Principle (*Rú Lǐ*) penetrating without obstruction. If Precepts, Goodness, Truths, Conditions, Degrees, etc., all Dharma Medicines are known using As-Real Wisdom, it is named "Penetrating Without Obstruction."<br>
*   **Mutual Containment:**<br>
    *   Also, the "Penetrating Without Obstruction" in the Provisional Wisdom text discusses the Real regarding the Provisional.<br>
    *   In the Real Wisdom text, "Also regarding all dharmas" discusses the Provisional regarding the Real.<br>
    *   The two texts appear reciprocally (*Gèn Xiàn*). This clarifies that **Real is Provisional-Real**, and **Provisional is Real-Provisional**. You should know that ultimately it is **Neither Provisional Nor Real**, **Neither Different Nor Not Different**.<br>
    *   Using Wisdom/Expedients, the Provisional has differences; when all arrive at the Wisdom Ground, there is no difference.<br>
    *   Like the Ground having no difference, but the plants being various. The "Various" has no "Various" [in the Ground]; the "No Various" has "Various" [in the Plants].<br>
    *   Like discussing Dharmas regarding Mind, or Mind regarding Dharmas. Mind has various numbers, Dharmas have no numbers; Mind is not separate from Dharmas, Dharmas not separate from Mind. Countless yet Counting, Counting yet Countless. Provisional and Real are also thus [Non-Dual].<br>
161: 
162: **Parable Speech (*Pì Shuō*):**<br>
163: From "For Example" (*Pì Rú*) downwards is the **Second**, the Parable Speech. Text is divided into two: First, Parable Speech; Second, Repeating the Source and Praising.<br>
164: **Opening and Combining (*Kāi Hé*):**<br>
165: The Parable has Opening and Combining. Opening is two:<br>
166: 1.  **Likeness of Differentiation (*Chā Bié Pì*):** Metaphors the Provisional Teaching and Provisional Wisdom discussed above.<br>
167: 2.  **Likeness of Non-Differentiation (*Wú Chā Bié Pì*):** Metaphors the Real Teaching and Real Wisdom discussed above.<br>
168: *   **Differentiation:** The Three Grasses and Two Trees are unequal in fineness/thickness, thus "Differentiation."<br>
169: *   **Non-Differentiation:** The One Ground and One Rain universally support and universally moisten, thus "Non-Differentiation."<br>
170: *   **Synthesis:** If observing the Branches/Streams, we say each is different. If investigating the Root and Glory, it is all nothing but Ground and Rain.<br>
171: *   **Internal Match:** Provisional Wisdom illuminates the Seven and Five as distinct. Real Wisdom goes to illuminate and ultimately returns to One Real. One Real is Seven/Five; Seven/Five are One Real. Difference is Non-Difference; Non-Difference is Difference.<br>
172: 
173: **The Six Parables of Differentiation:**<br>
174: 1.  **Land/Ground (*Tǔ Dì*):**<br>
175:     *   *Old Interpretation:* Generally raises the Three Thousand Lands, specifically citing Mountains, Rivers, Streams, Valleys as the Habit-Cause (*Xí Yīn*) of the Five Vehicles. Valley receiving much water metaphors Bodhisattva; Stream metaphors Pratyekabuddha; River metaphors Sravaka; Mountain High receiving less moisture metaphors Human/Heaven Vehicle.<br>
176:     *   *Current Critique:* The Habit-Causes should metaphor the Seeds receiving moisture and growing. But Land/Mountains/Rivers, though receiving moisture, lack the two meanings of "Seeds" and "Growth." Also, the Matching text below says "Universally covering the World, Heavens, Humans, Asuras," and the Verses say "Among all heavenly and human multitudes"—neither uses Land to metaphor Habit-Causes. Thus, we do not use this [Old] interpretation.<br>
177:     *   *Current Interpretation:* We use **"Great Thousand Worlds"** to metaphor the **Sentient Being World**. "Mountains, Rivers, Streams, Valleys, Land" metaphor the **Five Skandhas World**.<br>
178:         *   World has no separate dharma; it is constituted by Mountains/Rivers/Land.<br>
179:         *   Sentient Beings have no separate dharma; they are constituted by Five Skandhas.<br>
180:         *   Land permeates to metaphor Consciousness Skandha. Mountains/Rivers/Valleys metaphor the other four Skandhas. The reliant Grasses/Trees rely on the Land/Earth, but the Land/Earth is not the Grasses/Trees. The Grass/Tree substance/trunk is merely named Grass/Tree. The Grass/Tree seeds have no further name, but taking the "efficacy of being able to produce," they are named Seeds. The produced trunk/substance is named Grass/Tree. All are planted/rooted in the Ground; the Ground is the Root/Basis.<br>
181:     *   *Internal Match:* Habit-Cause and Habit-Fruit, though relying on the Five Skandhas, the Five Skandhas are not the Cause/Fruit. One must rely on the Skandhas to have Habit-Causes; growth and accomplishment is named Habit-Fruit. Fruit and Cause arising in reliance on Skandhas—thus the Mountains/Rivers/Land parable is established; Grass/Tree/Seeds receiving moisture and growing—this parable is also established.<br>
182:     *   *Refined Parable:* Although Mountains are high and steep, they have five marks like depressions/elevations. Even if Land is flat, it has five marks like mounds/ponds. These metaphor the **Five Skandhas of the Five Vehicles**.<br>
183:         *   Mountain High: Metaphors Bodhisattva Five Skandhas.<br>
184:         *   River: Metaphors Sravaka.<br>
185:         *   Stream: Metaphors Pratyekabuddha.<br>
186:         *   Land: Metaphors Heaven.<br>
187:         *   Valley/Bottom: Metaphors Human.<br>
188:     *   Each Five Skandhas has the reliance of Habit-Cause and Habit-Fruit, just as Mountains/Rivers/Land are the reliance of Seeds/Trunks.<br>
189: 
190: 2.  **Produced Plants and Trees (*Suǒ Shēng Huì Mù*):**<br>
191:     *   **"Hui" (*Huì*):** General name for Grasses.<br>
192:     *   **"Mu" (*Mù*):** General title for Trees.<br>
193:     *   Many grasses form a **Cluster** (*Cóng*). Many trees form a **Forest** (*Lín*).<br>
194:     *   **"Medicinal Herbs":** Those with superior power to cure sickness are called "Medicine." Just as all Good Dharmas can cure Evil, but Non-Leaking Goodness is superior in curing Delusion.<br>
195:     *   **Trees/Forests:** Branches/Trunks cover shade broadly, vessel utility is great; thus metaphors the Two Bodhisattvas.<br>
196:     *   **"Species Various/Manifold" (*Zhǒng Lèi Ruò Gān*):** The Cause/Fruit seeds of the Five Vehicles and Seven Goodnesses, thus "Manifold." Each species has a designation (*Name*) and a substance/mark (*Form/Rupa*).<br>
197: 
198: 3.  **Dense Cloud (*Mì Yún*):**<br>
199:     *   Clouds have Form/Color and Covering/Shade. Below text says "Thunder Sound far quakes."<br>
200:     *   **Covering/Shade:** Metaphors Buddha's Compassion (*Cí Bēi*).<br>
201:     *   **Form/Color:** Metaphors Buddha's Responsive Body (*Yìng Shì*).<br>
202:     *   **Thunder Sound:** Metaphors Buddha's Verbal Teaching (*Yán Jiào*).<br>
203:     *   **Three Mysteries (*Sān Mì*):** Dense Cloud is the Three Mysteries. Compassion is Mind Mystery. Form/Color is Body Mystery. Thunder Sound is Mouth Mystery.<br>
204:     *   **"Spreading/Cloth" (*Mí Bù*):** Means pervasive. Being both dense and pervasive, it says "Spreading." Using Compassion to perfume, the Responsive Body speaking Dharma pervades the Ten Dharma Realms, thus "Spreading."<br>
205:     *   **Citation (*Jīng Lǜ Yì Xiàng*):**<br>
206:         *   **"Clouds have Five Colors:** Azure means much Wind. Red means much Fire. Yellow/White means much Earth. Black means much Water."<br>
207:         *   **"Four Lightning Masters:** East: *Shēn Wèi*. South: *Bǎi Zhǔ*. West: *Ā Jié Luó*. North: *Ā Zhù Lán*."<br>
208:         *   **"Thunder Causes:** The Four Lightnings fighting causes Thunder. Also Water, Fire, Wind, Earth fighting causes Thunder."<br>
209:         *   **"Five Events Cause No Rain:** 1. Wind rises and blows it away. 2. Fire rises and scorches it. 3. Asuras catch it by hand and throw it into the sea. 4. Rain Master is lascivious/disorderly. 5. King does not govern reasonably, Rain Master is angry and does not rain." (etc.)
    *   **Extended Example Sequence (Other Sutras):**
        *   Also in other Sutras, it says Dragons, Birds, Ghosts, Spirits, etc., hear the Dharma and attain the Way.
        *   **Current/Later Benefits:**
            *   If "Fire Extinguished, Soup Cold," this is **Present World Peace/Security**.
            *   Or "Born in Heavens/Humans," this is **Later Birth in Good Place**.
            *   "Cultivating Way in Heaven/Humans," this is **Receiving Joy by the Way**.
        *   **Application to Beings:**
            *   **Humans/Heavens:** Hearing Dharma, Holding Precepts, Virtue supporting the body, Ghosts/Dragons not violating—this is **Present Security**. Or Heavens reborn as Heavens/Humans, or Humans reborn as Humans—this is **Later Good Place**. Born and able to awaken/understand—this is **Joy by the Way**.
            *   **Two Vehicles:** Hearing Dharma and attaining Remainder Nirvana—this is **Present Security**. As the text below says: "This person produces the Extinction Thought regarding attained merit," and "I will become a Buddha in another land with a different name." This person hearing this Sutra in that land—referring to the Expedient Remainder Land being the **Good Place**; hearing the Sutra there is **Joy by the Way**.
            *   **Birth Body Bodhisattva:** Hearing Rochana Buddha speak Dharma and attaining Non-Birth Patience—this is **Present Security**. Later born in the Pure Fullness World (*Jìng Mǎn Shì Jiè*) as Dharma Body Retinue—this is **Good Place and Joy by the Way**. "Separating from various obstructions" is Present Security. "According to power/capacity gradually entering the Way" is Later Joy by the Way.
        *   **Five Vehicles:**
            1.  **Five Precepts Vehicle:** Exits Three Paths suffering.
            2.  **Ten Goodnesses Vehicle:** Exits Human Path Eight Sufferings.
            3.  **Sravaka Vehicle:** Exits Three Realms Impermanence Suffering.
            4.  **Pratyekabuddha Vehicle:** Exits "Suffering of Hearing Dharma from Others."
            5.  **Bodhisattva Vehicle:** Exits "Internal No Sharp Wisdom, External No Marks/Goodness" suffering.

**Matching the Six Parables (Summary):**
*   From **"Like that Great Cloud"** (*Rú Bǐ Dà Yún*) downwards is the **Second**, bringing up the Parable to match the Six Meanings:
    1.  **"Great Cloud":** Matches the First Meanings (Form/Sound Two Benefits).
    2.  **"Raining on all":** Matches the Second Meaning (Six Chapters/Dharma Gates).
    3.  **"Grasses, Trees, Thickets, Forests":** Matches the Fourth Meaning (Receiving Transformed Beings, Sharp/Dull, Diligent/Lazy, Habit-Cause Deep/Shallow).
    4.  **"According to their species sufficiently moistened":** Matches the Fifth Meaning (Receiving Moisture/Getting Dharma Benefits).
    5.  **"Each gets growth":** Matches the Sixth Meaning (Present Security/Growth).

        *   **Q/A on Vehicle Counts:**
            *   *Question:* Should only use Human/Heaven as Worldly Vehicle, rest as Trans-Worldly? Or Buddha as Real, rest as Provisional? Or Buddha as Fruit, rest as Cause? Or Three Vehicles (Human/Heaven=Low, 2V=Middle, Buddha=High)? Or Human/Heaven=Not Severing, 2V=Severing, Buddha=Non-Severing Non-Not-Severing? Etc.
            *   *Answer:* *Da Lun* clarifies Five Good Roots; *Sheng Man* clarifies Four Stores. How about Three Grasses Two Trees? Human/Heaven are Two Goodnesses; Two Vehicles are One; Buddha/Bodhisattva are Five. Opening Large Combining Small, etc. (See text).
<br>
210: 
211: 4.  **Pouring Rain (*Zhù Yǔ*):**<br>
212:     *   Metaphors using Mouth Mystery, Eight Sounds, and Four Eloquences to proclaim and pour the Dharma Rain, enriching sentient beings.<br>
213: 
214: 5.  **Receiving Moisture (*Zhān Rùn*):**<br>
215:     *   The Dharma Jewel universally rains on the Habit-Cause Seeds in the Mind-Ground of the Seven Kinds of beings. Birth of **Hearing Wisdom** (*Wén Huì*) is named "Moistening/Soaking."<br>
216:     *   **"Branches, Leaves, Roots, Stems":** Faith is Root. Precepts are Stem. Concentration is Branch. Wisdom is Leaf. They aid each other in sequence, thus metaphors these four.<br>
217:     *   Small/Medium/Great Roots/Stems metaphor Human/Heaven, Two Vehicles, and Bodhisattva Faith/Precepts.<br>
218: 
219: 6.  **Growth (*Zēng Zhǎng*):**<br>
220:     *   Briefly restates that plants/trees receive moisture according to their portion. Habit and Retribution—the two Cause Good Dharmas—receive Dharma rain, and Habit and Retribution—the two Fruit Goodnesses—each obtain growth.<br>
221:     *   **"Matching their Seed Nature":** Dispensing Provisionals matches the Capacity. Small do not exceed their portion; Great do not decrease.<br>
222:     *   **"Flowers/Fruit spreading substantially":** This is the Two Fruits of Habit and Retribution.<br>
223: 
224: **Likeness of Non-Differentiation (One Ground, One Rain):**<br>
225: From "Although one ground produces" downwards. This is the **Second** large segment, metaphoring the One Real.<br>
226: 1.  **One Ground Produced:** Produced from the Mind-Ground *before* the Way, ultimately caused by the Wisdom-Ground *after* the Way.<br>
227: 2.  **One Cloud Raining:** One Sound claiming the One Vehicle Dharma Gate. Developing the Five Good Roots *in* the Way. Ultimately it is the Teaching of One Sound Equality.<br>
228: 3.  **Unconscious Benefit:** The Three Grasses and Two Trees receive benefit without self-awareness. The Five Good Roots receive Buddha's Dharma Rain and grow according to portion without self-knowing. The Five Causes all rely on **One Buddha Nature**, yet they do not know the Five Vehicle Teachings are all Mahayana, nor do they know they return together to Buddha Wisdom. Only the Tathagata is able to know.<br>

**From "The Tathagata at that time" to "Diligent and Lazy":**<br>
This is the **Fourth**, matching the above **Second Parable, Plants and Trees** (*Huì Mù Pì*).<br>
*   **Old Interpretation:** Says this text is "Long Out" (*Cháng Chū* - Redundant/Added) and does not match the above.<br>
*   **Current Clarification:** The above parable has the textual differentiation of Plants/Trees and Big/Small. This text clarifies **Roots as Sharp/Dull** (*Gēn Yǒu Lì Dùn*) and **Practice as Diligent/Lazy** (*Xíng Yǒu Jìn Dài*). This is precisely the **Shallow and Deep Habit Causes** (*Xí Yīn*), which is identical in meaning to the Plants/Trees. How could it not match the parable and be called "Redundant"?<br>
*   **"At that time" (*Yú Shí*):** If discussing the "Gradual Beginning," it is Deer Park initially speaking the Three Vehicles time. If discussing the Middle, everywhere one can discuss "At that time."<br>
*   **"Sharp and Dull" (*Lì Dùn*):**<br>
    *   **General Assessment:** Three Paths (Hell/Ghost/Animal) having evil causes and suffering fruits, unable to accept the Way, are named "Dull." Seven Expedients hearing the teaching and gaining benefit are named "Sharp."<br>
    *   **Specific Assessment:** Human/Heaven only accepting retribution fruit and not willing to accept the Way are named "Dull." Three Vehicles roots/natures severing delusion and exiting the realm are named "Sharp."<br>
    *   **Further:** Sravakas observing Birth/Death are "Dull." Bodhisattvas observing Non-Birth/Non-Death are "Sharp." (Shared, Separate, Perfect etc.)<br>
*   **"Diligent and Lazy" (*Jīng Dài*):**<br>
    *   Three Paths indulgent/unrestrained (*Fàng Yì*) are named "Lazy."<br>
    *   Human/Heaven keeping Five Precepts/Ten Goodness are "Diligent." Human/Heaven not loathing suffering are "Lazy."<br>
    *   Two Vehicles fearing Impermanence are "Diligent." Two Vehicles craving realization and not seeking to be Buddha are "Lazy."<br>
    *   Bodhisattvas willfully seeking the Buddha Path are "Diligent."<br>
**From "According to their capacity" to "Quickly obtaining good benefit":**<br>
This is the **Fifth**, matching the above **Fifth Parable, Receiving Moisture** (*Shòu Rùn*).<br>
*   **"According to their capacity":** Meaning fitting/meeting the capacity's suitability, without error of increase or decrease.<br>
*   **"Joyfully obtaining good benefit":** Meaning each receives the Dharma moisture and receives benefit.

<div class="english-translation">
**From "The Tathagata speaks Dharma of One Form" downwards:**<br>
This is the **Second**, Matching the **Non-Differentiating Parable** (*Hé Wú Chā Bié Pì*). Above opened as three; now the matching is also three, but not in sequence.<br>
1.  **"One Form One Flavor":** Doubly matches **One Ground and One Rain**.<br>
2.  **"So-called":** Doubly explains One Ground and One Rain.<br>
3.  **"If there are beings":** Matches the above "Various grasses and trees each have differentiation."<br>
4.  **"Why is this?":** Explains the differentiation; The Tathagata is able to know Differentiation and Non-Differentiation.<br>
<br>
**Detailed Explanation:**<br>
*   **"One Form" (*Yī Xiàng*):** The mind of sentient beings is Identical to the One True Suchness Form (*Tóng Yī Zhēn Rú Xiàng*). This is the **One Ground**.<br>
*   **"One Flavor" (*Yī Wèi*):** The Dharma of the One Vehicle identically elucidates One Principle (*Tóng Quán Yī Lǐ*). This is the **One Rain**.<br>
*   **History:** Formerly, regarding the One Real Mark, he expediently opened it as Seven Marks. Regarding the One Vehicle Dharma, he differentiated and spoke Seven Teachings. The Buddha knows that ultimately they finally return (*Zhōng Guī*) to One Form and One Flavor.<br>
*   **"So-called":** Doubly explains One Form One Flavor. Sentient beings' Mind Nature *is* the Nature Virtue (*Xìng Dé*). The three kinds of marks—**Liberation, Separation, Extinction** (*Jiě Tuō, Yuǎn Lí, Jì Miè*)—are the One Sound of the Tathagata speaking these three Dharmas, which is the Three Flavors.<br>
*   **Progression:** These three marks take the Boundary/Object (*Jìng Jiè*) as conditions to produce the Middle Way Practice. Finally, one obtains the All-Wisdom Fruit. Thus it says: "**Ultimately arriving at All-Seed Wisdom**."<br>
*   **Combining the Differentiation Parable:** This combines the grasses/trees differentiation parable. As explained later, it is not repeated here.<br>
*   **Three Meanings of Matching (Sometimes):**<br>
    1.  **Non-Differentiation Meaning:** Matches the **One Ground and One Rain**.<br>
    2.  **Differentiation Meaning:** Matches **Grasses/Trees Differentiation**.<br>
    3.  **Tathagata Able to Know:** Explains and completes the two meanings.<br>
    *   **Non-Differentiation:** Refers to **One Form and One Flavor**. **One Form** matches the **One Ground**.<br>
*   **Definitions (First Pass):**<br>
    *   **"Liberation Form":** No Samsara Form (*Wú Shēng Sǐ Xiàng*).<br>
    *   **"Separation Form":** No Nirvana Form (*Wú Niè Pán Xiàng*).<br>
    *   **"Extinction Form":** No Form and also "No Form" (No Mark of No Mark). Only having Real Mark is therefore named **One Form**. **One Form** is the **Non-Abiding Root** establishing all Dharmas. **Non-Abiding/No-Form** is **Non-Differentiation**. **Establishing All Dharmas** is **Differentiation**. **Differentiation** is like Plants/Trees; **Non-Differentiation** is like One Ground.<br>
*   **Ground/Plants Analogy:** Although the Ground has no differentiation, it can produce the differentiated kinds of peaches, plums, grasses, and trees. Although peaches, plums, grasses, and trees differ, they share one hard nature. If you know the Ground contains peaches and plums, then you recognize **Provisional within the Real**, and understand **Non-Differentiation is Differentiation**. If you know the hard nature of peaches and plums, then you recognize **Real within the Provisional**, and understand **Differentiation is Non-Differentiation**. By this meaning, **One Form** matches the **One Ground** parable.<br>
*   **One Flavor:** This is the **Real Teaching**—purely one, without admixture. By analogy, One Form can be understood in the same way.<br>
*   **Definitions (Second Pass):**<br>
    *   **"Liberation":** Free from the karmic bondage of the two extremes of **Segmented** and **Transformed** [birth/death]. Thus it is called **Liberation Form**.<br>
    *   **"Separation":** Obtaining **Middle Way Wisdom**; this wisdom can far-separate from the two extremes with no attachment. Thus it is called **Separation Form**.<br>
    *   **"Extinction":** The **causes** of the two extremes extinguished yields **Remainder Nirvana**; the **fruits** of the two extremes extinguished yields **No-Remainder Nirvana**. Thus it is called **Extinction Form**.<br>
*   **Each Sentence:** Each sentence can be taken as **Differentiation/Non-Differentiation**. Use **One Form** as the standard to understand the rest.

### 12. Critique of "Ash-Body" Intrepretations (Lines 80-84)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「究竟至於一切種智」者，若得二邊滅相，即是通、別二惑盡，入佛知見，以一切種智心中行般若，初發、畢竟二不別，故言「究竟」，此即佛之智慧，故言「一切種智」也。
從「如來知是」下，第四，牒前總結能知也。「一相一味」等，如前釋。一相一味、解脫、離、滅等，為緣分別，即是一中無量；「究竟涅槃終歸於空」，即是無量中一。此是牒前重釋無差別也。何者？一相一味、解脫、離、滅，若是二乘法體，猶是差別言宣，今作大乘究竟涅槃終歸於空，即通無差別。究竟涅槃結前諸句皆非二乘有餘無餘，乃是究竟涅槃也。「常寂滅相」者，結諸句非是小乘寂滅，乃是常住寂滅。上文云「諸法從本來常自寂滅相」，即此義也。「終歸於空」者，非是灰斷之空，乃是中道第一義空，鄭重抵掌簡實異權。舊云終歸於空者，雖復神通延壽無量示現復倍上數，壽盡終歸灰斷，故言終歸空。此苦佛苦經，那可言？光宅云：終歸入有餘，捨無常身智也。有人難此解，若爾與二乘何異？經文舉兩究竟，初究竟至於一切種智，此舉智果對二乘智非究竟；二舉究竟涅槃常寂滅相終歸於空，此舉斷對二乘斷非究竟。究竟之文，知非小乘空也。龍印云：大涅槃空，無法相、無煩惱故名空，終歸常住第一義空。忠師云：終歸第一義空智慧。有人云，佛果無累故言空。注者云：空有洞遣乃名空。古諸師皆不作小解，光宅何意獨然？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**"Ultimately arriving at All-Seed Wisdom":** If one obtains the Extinction Mark of the Two Extremes (Samsara/Nirvana), then the Two Delusions (Shared/Separate) are exhausted, entering Buddha Knowledge. Practicing Prajna within the All-Seed Wisdom Mind, the Initial Launch and the Ultimate End are not two/different. Thus it says "Ultimate." This is the Buddha's Wisdom, thus "All-Seed Wisdom."<br>
<br>
**From "The Tathagata knows this" (Line 80):**<br>
This is the Fourth, repeating the previous to generally conclude "Able to Know."<br>
*   **"One Form, One Flavor" etc.:** As explained above. **One Form/One Flavor, Liberation, Separation, Extinction** and the like are differentiations of conditions—this is the **Immeasurable within the One**.<br>
*   **"Ultimate Nirvana finally returning to Emptiness":** This is "One within the Immeasurable." This repeats the previous to re-explain Non-Differentiation.<br>
*   **Why?** If One Form, One Flavor, Liberation, Separation, Extinction were the substance of the Two Vehicles' Dharma, they would still be differentiated verbal explanations. Now, acting as Mahayana Ultimate Nirvana finally returning to Emptiness, it penetrates Non-Differentiation.<br>
*   **"Ultimate Nirvana":** Concludes that the previous concepts are *not* the Remainder/No-Remainder [Nirvana] of the Two Vehicles; they are indeed the **Ultimate Nirvana**.<br>
*   **"Constantly Extinguished Form" (*Cháng Jì Miè Xiàng*):** Concludes the sentences are not Small Vehicle Extinction, but **Constantly Abiding Extinction**. As the text above says: "All Dharmas from the beginning are constantly of the Self-Extinguished Form," this is the meaning.<br>
*   **"Finally Returning to Emptiness" (*Zhōng Guī Yú Kōng*):**<br>
    *   **The Correct View:** It is **NOT the Emptiness of Ash-Cutting** (*Fēi Shì Huī Duàn Zhī Kōng* - i.e., annihilating body/consciousness). It **IS the Middle Way First Principle Emptiness** (*Zhōng Dào Dì Yī Yì Kōng*). This solemnly claps hands (* Zhèng Zhòng Dǐ Zhǎng*) to select the Real and differentiate from the Provisional.<br>
    *   **Old Interpretation (*Jiù Yún*):** Says "Finally returning to Emptiness" means: although they have supernatural powers, extend their life immeasurably, and manifest again doubling the number above, when life is exhausted, they finally return to Ash and Cutting [Annihilation]. Thus "Returning to Emptiness."<br>
    *   **Zhiyi's Critique:** This causes suffering to the Buddha and suffering to the Sutra (*Kǔ Fó Kǔ Jīng*). How can it be said?<br>
    *   **Guangzhai's Interpretation:** "Finally returning" means entering Remainder [Nirvana], abandoning the Impermanent Body and Wisdom.<br>
    *   **Critique of Guangzhai:** Someone challenges this explanation: "If so, how is it different from the Two Vehicles?" The Sutra text raises **Two Ultimates**:<br>
        1.  "Ultimately arriving at All-Seed Wisdom": Raises **Wisdom Fruit** to contrast with Two Vehicle Wisdom being non-ultimate.<br>
        2.  "Ultimate Nirvana finally returning to Emptiness": Raises **Severing Fruit** (*Duàn Guǒ*) to contrast with Two Vehicle Severing being non-ultimate.<br>
    *   **Conclusion:** The text "Ultimate" lets us know it is **Not Small Vehicle Emptiness**.<br>
    *   **Master Longyin (Dragon Seal):** "Great Nirvana Emptiness—having no Dharma Mark and no Afflictions is named Emptiness. Finally returning to Constantly Abiding First Principle Emptiness."<br>
    *   **Master Zhong:** "Finally returning to First Principle Emptiness Wisdom."<br>
    *   **Annotator:** "Emptiness and Existence are both deeply banished, thus named Emptiness."<br>
    *   **Final Rebuke:** The ancient masters all did not make the "Small" [Vehicle] interpretation. **Why does Guangzhai alone stand alone so [incorrectly]?**

「如是迦葉」下，第二，五行，頌上無差別譬。又為二：前一行半，頌無差別之差別；後三行半，頌差別無差別。「譬如大雲如一味雨」，即頌合上一味雨無差別也。「潤於人華各得成實」，即是頌上差別也。次「迦葉當知以諸因緣」下，即是明權權即差別，合上所生也。「今當為汝」者即是顯實，實即無差別，合上一地也。「非滅度」者，未度變易也。獨言二乘者，為其保證強也。人天不計，果為涅槃，菩薩不中間取證也。「是菩薩道」者，菩薩行道亦須斷通惑，汝已斷盡即是菩薩道。《法華論》謂，發心退已還發，前所修善不滅，同後得果。二乘智斷是菩薩道者，二乘執其果故斥，言是菩薩道，道即因也。

問：菩薩亦有果，〈信解〉云「得道得果」，《大品》云「有法是菩薩道，無法是菩薩果」，何故不言是菩薩果？

答：

此義亦應得，今言若道若果皆是佛因，因即是道也。

**1. Dharma Speech (5 Lines):**
*   **"Like this Kasyapa"** (*Rú Shì Jiā Yè*) downwards is the **Second**, 5 lines, versing the **Non-Differentiation Parable**.
*   **Divided into Two:**
    1.  **First 1.5 Lines:** Verse the **Differentiation of Non-Differentiation** (*Wú Chā Bié Zhī Chā Bié*).
    2.  **Last 3.5 Lines:** Verse the **Non-Differentiation of Differentiation** (*Chā Bié Wú Chā Bié*).
*   **Specific Lines:**
    *   *"Like Great Cloud, Like One Flavor Rain":* Matches the **One Flavor Rain** (Non-Differentiation) above.
    *   *"Moistening Human Flowers, each getting fruit":* Matches the **Differentiation** above.
    *   *"Kasyapa should know, by causes and conditions"*: This clarifies that the **Provisional of the Provisional** (*Quán Quán*) is Differentiation, matching the "Things Produced" (Grass/Trees) above.
    *   *"I now for your sake"*: This **Reveals the Real** (*Xiǎn Shí*). Real is Non-Differentiation, matching the **One Ground** above.

**2. Bodhisattva Path and Doctrine (Source Lines 109 continued):**
*   **"Not Extinction (Nirvana) This is the Bodhisattva Path":**
    *   **"Not Extinction":** Means they have not yet crossed the Variable Birth/Death (*Biàn Yì*).
    *   **"Only mentions Two Vehicles":** This is to forcefully assure them (of their future Buddhahood).
    *   Humans/Devas do not calculate their Fruit as Nirvana. Bodhisattvas do not seize realization in the middle.
    *   **"This is the Bodhisattva Path":** Bodhisattvas practicing the Way also must cut off the Shared Delusions (*Tōng Huò*). "You have already cut them off"—this *is* the Bodhisattva Way. "Way" (*Dào*) means Cause.
    *   ***Treatise on the Lotus Sutra*:** "Aroused mind, retreated, then aroused again previous good is not extinguished, same as the later obtained fruit."
    *   **Why call Two Vehicle Wisdom/Severance the Bodhisattva Path?** Because the Two Vehicles cling to it as a Fruit. The Buddha rebukes them, saying "This is [just] the Bodhisattva Path (Cause)."

**3. Question and Answer on Bodhisattva Fruit (Source Lines 115-119):**
*   **Question:** Bodhisattvas also have a Fruit. The *Faith Interpretation Chapter* says "Attaining the Way, Attaining the Fruit." The *Great Treatise* says "Having Dharmas is Bodhisattva Path, No Dharmas is Bodhisattva Fruit." Why not say "Is Bodhisattva Fruit"?
*   **Answer:**
    *   This meaning is also permissible.
    *   But here, we say: Whether Path or Fruit, **All are the Buddha Cause**. Cause is the Path within the Real.
<br>

</div>

*   **Conclusion on Structure:**<br>
    *   The prose explains the meaning extensively.<br>
    *   The verses reiterate the meaning (Repeating the Source) to assist understanding.<br>
    *   The doctrinal structure of "Opening Three, Revealing One" is maintained relative to the "One Ground" and "One Rain."<br>

釋授記品。梵音和伽羅，此云授記。諸經破受記，《淨名》云「從如生得記，從如滅得記，如無生滅則知無記。」《思益》云「願不聞記名」。《大品》云「受記是戲論」。今經云何？
答：若見有記記人，此見須破；菩薩誓記，此記須與。世諦故記，第一義故無。四悉，適時如下說；若通途記，如〈法師品〉初；若別與記，如三周後說；若正因記，如〈常不輕〉；若緣因記，如〈法師品〉十種供養；若了因記，如授三根人；若正因記則廣，若緣了記則狹，或遲記、或速記；或佛記如此文，或菩薩記如不輕，雖無劫國之定亦得是記；復懸記，如〈化城品〉未來弟子是也。他經但記菩薩、不記二乘，但記善、不記惡，但記男、不記女，但記人天、不記畜；今經皆記。
若《首楞嚴》有四種記，今經具之：未發心與記，如〈常不輕品〉，發心現前無生，三周記是也；《瓔珞》第九，八種授記，己知他不知，眾人盡知己不知，己眾俱知，己眾俱不知，近覺遠不覺，遠覺近不覺，俱覺，俱不覺。己知他不知者，發心自誓未廣及人，未得四無所畏，未得善權故。眾人盡知己不知者，發心廣大得無畏善權故。皆知者，位在七地無畏善權得空觀故。皆不知者，未入七地未得無著行(云云)。
遠者不覺者，彌勒是也，諸根具足不捨如來無著之行故。近者不覺，此人未能演說賢聖之行，師子膺是也。近遠俱覺者，諸根具足不捨無著之行，柔順菩薩是也。近遠俱不覺者，未得善權不能悉知如來藏，等行菩薩是也。餘經又云，近知者從現佛得記也，如彌勒等。遠知者，不從今佛從當佛得記，如佛語弊魔，彌勒當與汝記。近遠俱知者，今當佛俱與記也。近遠俱不知者，今當佛俱不記也。
元諸佛本為大事因緣出世，令眾生開示悟入佛之知見，今大事已顯，佛已說竟，眾生已入，暢佛本懷眾生願滿，法應與記，如父遇子豈不付財？又行人無量世行願願在今佛，文云「其本願如此故獲斯記」，此兩緣是世界悉檀故記。又二乘聞經改小入大，圓因已足，因必招果，故如來與記。時眾咸知發願，願為生身法身內外眷屬，或願但生彼土饒益眾生，此兩是為人悉檀與記。又授二乘記，破欲退大入小菩薩。何者？若定有二乘可退為小，今無二乘，何所可退？又破欲發二乘心者，彼證自捨，我何為取？又破未改小者則便改小，將證小者即不取證。此四，對治悉檀與記。又無生現前，必由實解開佛知見不謬，又明了佛性故與受記。小乘入實決定作佛，若爾一切眾生亦有佛性，何不與記？然眾生但正無緣，今聞經信解緣正具足，開佛知見知佛性、見佛法見佛性，此兩，第一義悉檀與記。此四記，攝上諸受記盡(云云)。
授記亦云受記、受決、受莂，授是與義，受是得義，記是記事，決是決定，莂是了莂。中根人聞法，譬二周開三顯一，具足領解如來述成，雖自知作佛，而時事未審，若蒙佛誠言，授其當果，劫國決定，近遠了莂，則大歡喜。今從佛授與得名，故言「授記品」。

**Explanation of the Bestowal of Prophecy Chapter (*Shì Shòu Jì Pǐn*):**<br>
The Sanskrit sound is **Vyākaraṇa** (*Hé Qié Luó*), translated here as **Bestowal of Prophecy** (*Shòu Jì*).<br>
**Critique of Prophecy in other Sutras:**<br>
*   ***Vimalakirti Sutra* (*Jìng Míng*):** "Is prophecy obtained from birth (*Rú Shēng*) or from extinction (*Rú Miè*)? If Like/Suchness (*Rú*) has no birth or extinction, then know there is no prophecy."<br>
*   ***Si Yi Sutra* (*Sī Yì*):** "I wish not to hear the name of Prophecy."<br>
*   ***Prajna Sutra* (*Dà Pǐn*):** "Receiving Prophecy is Playful Discourse (*Xì Lùn*)."<br>
*   **Question:** What does this Sutra say?<br>
**Answer:**<br>
*   **Breaking Views:** If one sees "There is a Prophecy that prophecies a Person," this view must be broken.<br>
*   **Bestowal:** If a Bodhisattva vows for prophecy, this prophecy must be given.<br>
*   **Two Truths:** By the Worldly Truth (*Shì Dì*), there is Prophecy. By the First Principle (*Dì Yī Yì*), there is none.<br>
*   **Four Siddhantas:** They are applied according to the time (as explained below).<br>
**Types of Prophecy:**<br>
*   **General Path Prophecy (*Tōng Tú Jì*):** Like the beginning of the *Dharma Teacher Chapter*.<br>
*   **Specific Bestowal Prophecy (*Bié Yǔ Jì*):** Like said after the Three Cycles.<br>
*   **Proper Cause Prophecy (*Zhèng Yīn Jì*):** Like *Never Disparaging Chapter*.<br>
*   **Conditional Cause Prophecy (*Yuán Yīn Jì*):** Like the Ten Kinds of Offerings in *Dharma Teacher Chapter*.<br>
*   **Revealing Cause Prophecy (*Liǎo Yīn Jì*):** Like bestowing to the Three Root People (here).<br>
*   **Scope:** Proper Cause is Broad; Conditional/Revealing is Narrow. Sometimes Slow Prophecy, Sometimes Fast Prophecy.<br>
*   **Agent:** Sometimes Buddha Prophecies (like this text); Sometimes Bodhisattva Prophecies (like Never Disparaging).<br>
*   **Content:** Even if without fixed Kalpa/Land, it still obtains being a prophecy. Also Remote Prophecy, like the future disciples in *Magic City Chapter*.<br>
**Unique Features of Lotus Sutra Prophecy:**<br>
*   Other Sutras only prophecy Bodhisattvas, not Two Vehicles.<br>
*   Only prophecy Good, not Evil (Devadatta).<br>
*   Only prophecy Men, not Women (Dragon Girl).<br>
*   Only prophecy Humans/Devas, not Animals (Dragon Girl).<br>
*   **This Sutra prophecies ALL.**<br>
**Shoulengyan and Yingluo Classifications:**<br>
*   ***Shurangama Samadhi* (*Shǒu Léng Yán*):** Has **Four Kinds of Prophecy**. This Sutra has them all.<br>
    *   Example: "Not yet aroused mind bestowed prophecy" (like *Never Disparaging*). "Aroused mind, Manifest No-Birth" (like Three Cycles Prophecy).<br>
*   ***Yingluo Sutra* (*Yīng Luò*) Ninth:** **Eight Kinds of Bestowal:**<br>
    1.  Self knows, Others know not.<br>
    2.  Others all know, Self knows not.<br>
    3.  Self and Others both know.<br>
    4.  Self and Others both know not.<br>
    5.  Near aware, Far not aware.<br>
    6.  Far aware, Near not aware.<br>
    7.  Both aware.<br>
    8.  Both not aware.<br>
    *   **"Self knows, Others know not":** Because having set the mind and self-vowed, but not yet broadly extending to others; not yet obtaining the Four Fearlessnesses; not yet obtaining Skillful Means.
    *   **"Others all know, Self knows not":** Because the Aroused Mind is vast and great, obtaining Fearlessness and Skillful Means.
    *   **"Both Know":** Position is in the **Seventh Ground** (*Seventh Bhumi*), obtaining Fearlessness, Skillful Means, and Empty Observation.
    *   **"Both Know Not":** Not yet entered Seventh Ground, not yet obtained Non-Attached Practice (*Wú Zhuó Xíng*).
    *   **"Far Not Aware" (*Yuǎn Zhě Bù Jué*):** This is **Maitreya**. Because his roots are complete and he does not abandon the Tathagata's Non-Attached Practice.
    *   **"Near Not Aware" (*Jìn Zhě Bù Jué*):** This person cannot yet expound the Sages' practice. This is **Lion's Breast** (*Shī Zǐ Yīng*) [Bodhisattva].
    *   **"Near/Far Both Aware":** Roots complete, not abandoning Non-Attached Practice. This is **Gentle Compliance Bodhisattva** (*Róu Shùn Pú Sà*).
    *   **"Near/Far Both Not Aware":** Not yet obtained Skillful Means, cannot fully know the Tathagata Store. This is **Equal Practice Bodhisattva** (*Děng Xíng Pú Sà*).
    *   **Other Sutras Say:**
        *   **"Near Know":** Obtaining prophecy from the **Present** Buddha. Like Maitreya etc.
        *   **"Far Know":** Not from Present Buddha, but obtaining prophecy from **Future** Buddha. Like Buddha telling the Evil Mara: "Maitreya will bestow prophecy upon you."
        *   **"Near/Far Both Know":** **Present and Future** Buddhas both bestow prophecy.
        *   **"Near/Far Both Not Know":** **Present and Future** Buddhas both do not bestow.<br>
**Rationales for Prophecy (Four Siddhantas):**<br>
1.  **Worldly Siddhanta:**<br>
    *   Buddhas appear for the Great Matter (Opening Buddha Knowledge). Now the Matter is revealed, Buddha has spoken, beings have entered. The Buddha's intent is fulfilled, beings' vows are filled. By Dharma, he should bestow prophecy. Like a father paying wealth to a son.<br>
    *   Practitioners practiced vows for immeasurable ages to be with this Buddha. Text says: "His original vow was like this, thus he obtains this prophecy."<br>
2.  **Individual Siddhanta (For People):**<br>
    *   Two Vehicles change Small to enter Great. Perfect Cause is full; Cause must attract Fruit. Thus Tathagata bestows.<br>
    *   The Multitude knows and makes vows to be inner/outer retinue or save beings. This is "For People."<br>
3.  **Therapeutic Siddhanta (Counteracting):**<br>
    *   Bestowing to Two Vehicles breaks the "Bodhisattvas desiring to retreat to Small." If Two Vehicles don't exist (all are One), where can they retreat to?<br>
    *   Breaks those desiring to arouse Two Vehicle Mind. "They (Arhats) abandon it themselves; why should I take it?"<br>
    *   Breaks those not yet changed to change; those about to verify Small to not take verification.<br>
4.  **First Principle Siddhanta:**<br>
    *   No-Birth manifests. Must rely on Real Understanding Opening Buddha Knowledge without error. Also clearly understanding Buddha Nature, thus bestowed.<br>
    *   If Small Vehicle entering Real decides Buddhahood, then all beings have Buddha Nature—why not prophecy all? Answer: Beings have Proper [Cause] but no Conditions. Now hearing Sutra, Conditions/Proper are complete. Seeing Buddha Dharma is seeing Buddha Nature.<br>
**Definitions:**<br>
*   **Shòu (授):** Giving meaning.<br>
*   **Shòu (受):** Receiving/Obtaining meaning.<br>
*   **Jì (記):** Recording capability/matter.<br>
*   **Jué (決):** Determination/Decision.<br>
*   **Bié (莂):** Distinct/Differentiation.<br>
*   **Context:** Medium Root people heard the Dharma (Parable Cycle), opened Three and revealed One, fully understood the Tathagata's narration. Though they know they will be Buddhas, the specific "Time/Events" are not examined. If they receive the Buddha's sincere words bestowing the Future Fruit, Kalpa, and Land decisively and clearly, they have Great Joy. Now taking the name from "Buddha Bestowing," it is called **Bestowal of Prophecy Chapter**.

### 14. Textual Explanation of the Chapter (Lines 129-135)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
此文是譬說第四段，上三段皆以譬喻說之，此中授記亦用譬喻論記。何意無第五段？一解云，指上指下略不論耳。又云，〈草喻〉中明一切受潤各得增長，審知四眾皆獲利益，經家略不出耳。文為二：一、正與中根授記，二、許為下根宿世之說。初又二：先授迦葉，次授三人，並有長行、偈頌。迦葉長行中有六：一行因，二得果，三劫國名字莊嚴，四壽命，五正像久近，六國淨。三弟子中復二：一請記，二與記。請記中七偈：初一行，正請。次二行半，開譬。次二行半，合譬。次一行，結三人記，各有行因得果劫國壽命法住數量，悉如文。從「我諸弟子」下二行半，許為下根更說宿世，此人已聞法譬，復見上中受記，而猶疑不了深生愧恥，欲增進其道，先許總記，更說宿緣(云云)。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**This text is the Fourth Section of the Parable Speech.**<br>
The above three sections all used Parables to speak. Here, Bestowal of Prophecy also uses Parables to discuss Prophecy.<br>
*   **Why no Fifth Section?**<br>
    *   *Interpretation 1:* Pointing above and below, it is omitted and not discussed.<br>
    *   *Interpretation 2:* The *Medicinal Herbs Parable* clarified that "All receiving moisture each obtain growth." We carefully know that the Four Assemblies all obtained benefits. The Sutra compiler omitted it and did not bring it out.<br>
**Structure:** Divided into Two:<br>
1.  **Correctly Bestowing Prophecy to Medium Roots.**<br>
2.  **Promising to speak of Past Lives for Lower Roots.**<br>
**1. Correctly Bestowing (Divided into Two):**<br>
*   **First:** Bestowing to **Kasyapa**.<br>
*   **Next:** Bestowing to **The Three People** (Subhuti, Maudgalyayana, Mahakatyayana).<br>
*   Both have Prose and Verses.<br>
**Kasyapa's Prose (Six Parts):**<br>
1.  Practice Cause (*Xíng Yīn*).<br>
2.  Obtaining Fruit (*Dé Guǒ*).<br>
3.  Kalpa, Land, Name, Adornment.<br>
4.  Lifespan.<br>
5.  Right/Image Dharma Duration (As in text).<br>
6.  Land Purity.<br>
**The Three Disciples (Two Parts):**<br>
1.  **Requesting Prophecy (*Qǐng Jì*):** Contains 7 Verses.<br>
    *   First 1 Verse: Correctly Requesting.<br>
    *   Next 2.5 Verses: Opening Parable.<br>
    *   Next 2.5 Verses: Matching Parable.<br>
    *   Next 1 Verse: Concluding.<br>
2.  **Bestowing Prophecy (*Yǔ Jì*):** Each of the three has Practice Cause, Fruit, Kalpa, Land, Lifespan, and Dharma Duration. (As in text).<br>
**2. Promising to Speak for Lower Roots:**<br>
*   **From "My Disciples" (2.5 Lines):** Promise to speak of Past Lives (*Sù Shì*) for the Lower Roots.<br>
*   **Rationale:** These people have heard the Dharma and Parables, and seen the Upper and Medium roots receive prophecy, yet still doubt and do not understand, giving rise to deep shame. Desiring to advance their Way, [The Buddha] first promises a General Prophecy, and then speaks of Past Conditions/Causes (*Sù Yuán*).<br>
*[End of Fascicle 7 Part 1]*
