## I. CONCLUSION OF EXPEDIENT MEANS VERSES (Lines 13-35; CBETA 005:13–35)

### 1. Using Expedients (Lines 13-19)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
[7]從「我始坐道場」下，第二十七行半，頌施方便化，就此為二：初有六行半，明念用大乘擬不得；次「尋念」下，第二十一行，明念同諸佛用三乘化，稱宜可得。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
From “I first sat at the place of enlightenment” onward, there are twenty‑seven and a half lines, versing the application of expedient transformation. Here it is two: first, six and a half lines clarify the thought of using the Great Vehicle (Mahāyāna)[^1] and finding it unsuitable; next, from “Seeking/Thinking” onward, twenty‑one lines clarify thinking together with the Buddhas to transform by the Three Vehicles[^2], matching what is appropriate and attainable.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
就初念用大化，又為三：初，一行半，明用大擬宜；次「眾生」下，第二，三行，明眾生無機；次「我即」下，第三，二行，明念息大化也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
As for the initial thought of using the Great transformation, it is again three: first, one and a half lines clarify using the Great and testing its appropriateness; next, from “living beings” onward, the second—three lines—clarifies that living beings lack capacity; next, from “I then” onward, the third—two lines—clarifies the thought of ceasing the Great transformation.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「始坐道場」者，至理無時，假時化物，為化之初故言始也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
As for “first sat at the place of enlightenment”: the ultimate principle has no time. Borrowing time to transform beings, and because it is the beginning of transformation, it is therefore called “first.”
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
事釋者，初在此處修治得道故言道場，坐此樹下得三菩提故名道樹，感樹恩故觀察，念地德故經行，道成賽澤之時，欲以大法擬宜眾生也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
In the “event/phenomenal” explanation: at first, because he cultivated and attained the Way in this place, it is called the “place of enlightenment.” Because he attained samyak‑sambodhi[^3] while seated beneath this tree, it is called the “Bodhi tree.” Feeling gratitude for the tree’s恩, he observes it; mindful of the ground’s virtue, he walks about. When the Way is accomplished and he repays its favor, he wishes to test the appropriateness of the Great Dharma for living beings.

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
觀心釋者，樹即十二因緣之大樹也，深觀緣起自成菩提，欲以無漏法林樹蔭[1]益眾生，故言「觀樹」。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
In the “contemplation‑of‑mind” explanation: the tree is precisely the great tree of the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising[^4]. Deeply contemplating dependent arising, one naturally accomplishes bodhi; wishing to benefit living beings with the shade of the forest of undefiled dharmas,[1] it therefore says “observe the tree.”
</div>

<div class="chinese-source">
「經行」者，大乘三十七品是行道法，自以道品履一切地得成佛道，欲以此法化度眾生，是故起行。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
As for “walking about” (*jingxing*): the Great Vehicle’s Thirty‑Seven Aids to Awakening[^5] are the methods of the path. He himself uses the path‑factors to tread all grounds and attain Buddhahood; wishing to transform and deliver beings by this Dharma, he therefore rises and walks.

樹地無有分別，豈須報恩？《未曾有經》云：「[2]秖以通化傳法，名報恩耳。

The tree and ground have no discrimination—why must one repay恩? The *Sūtra of Never‑Before‑Have*[^6] says: “[2] Only by universally transforming and transmitting the Dharma is it called ‘repaying恩.’”

」《過去因果經》云：「佛成道初一七日，思惟我法妙無能受者；二七日思眾生上、中、下根；三七日思惟誰應先聞法。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
The *Past Causes and Effects Sūtra*[^7] says: “In the first seven days after the Buddha accomplished the Way, he contemplated: ‘My Dharma is subtle; none can receive it.’ In the second seven, he contemplated living beings’ upper, middle, and lower roots. In the third seven, he contemplated who should first hear the Dharma.”

<div class="english-translation">
Then he went to Vārāṇasī and preached the Four Noble Truths[^14] to five persons. Kauṇḍinya attained the pure Dharma‑eye; Aśvajit, Daśabala‑Kāśyapa, Mahānāman, and Koli did not yet attain the Way. The Buddha again preached the Four Truths, and the four attained the pure Dharma‑eye.

<div class="chinese-source">
佛又說五陰無常、苦、空、非我，五人得阿羅漢。

The Buddha further taught that the five aggregates are impermanent, suffering, empty, and not‑self; the five attained arhatship.[^15]

<div class="english-translation">
Below, the Buddha Suwanghuazhi[^10] teaches the Lotus Sūtra beneath the seven‑jeweled Bodhi tree; therefore one should know that the present Buddha also taught the Lotus beneath the Bodhi tree. But dull‑rooted beings could not bear it, and so—truly in accord with the Buddhas—he opened the Three to transform, and later, in the royal city, spoke the One Vehicle only.”

</div>
<div class="english-translation">
If we follow the intent of the Zhiyi Master, then first beneath the Bodhi tree he taught Buddha‑wisdom, and later in other places he taught Buddha‑wisdom—just as the present Buddha first taught the Avataṃsaka[^11] and later taught the Lotus[^9]. Therefore the text says: “First seeing my body and hearing what I say, [they] enter the Tathāgata’s wisdom.”

Question:
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
何故初為五人轉法輪？

Why, at first, did he turn the Dharma wheel for five persons?

答：
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Answer:
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
人先見諦故、人是現見故、人為證故、佛所行事業與人同故，諸天從人中得善利故、人中有四眾故。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Because humans first see the truths[^14]; because humans are manifestly seen; because humans serve as witnesses; because the Buddha’s deeds and activities are the same as humans’; because devas obtain good benefits from among humans; and because among humans there are the four assemblies.[^13]

<div class="chinese-source">
輪王出世聲至他化自在，憍陳如得道聲至梵天，佛得道聲至首陀會，何故爾？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
When a Wheel‑Turning King[^30] appears, his sound reaches the Paranirmita‑vaśavartin Heaven[^17]; when Kauṇḍinya[^18] attains the Way, the sound reaches Brahmā Heaven[^19]; when the Buddha attains the Way, the sound reaches the Śuddhāvāsa[^20]. Why is this?
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
答：善業、名譽業、稱讚父母師長業，有上中下故爾也。若使有頂有耳識者，佛聲亦至彼。輪王行十善，善生欲天，欲天喜我眷屬增多故；陳如離欲故徹梵；佛最勝至尼吒(云云)。若依大乘，佛得道聲遍至百億尼吒，又遍十方無量無邊世界尼吒(云云)。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Answer: Because the karma of good deeds, the karma of reputation, and the karma of praising parents and teachers have superior, middle, and lower grades. If the Peak of Existence[^21] had ear‑consciousness, the Buddha’s sound would also reach there. The Wheel‑Turning King practices the ten wholesome deeds; the wholesome are born in the Desire Heavens, and the Desire Heavens rejoice that my retinue increases. Kauṇḍinya, having left desire, penetrates Brahmā. The Buddha, being most supreme, reaches Niṭha[^22] (etc.). If according to the Mahāyāna, the Buddha’s attainment‑of‑the‑Way sound pervades a hundred billion Niṭha, and further pervades the Niṭha of the ten directions’ immeasurable, boundless worlds (etc.).

### 3. The Three Weeks of Thinking (Lines 32-35; CBETA 005:32–35)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
初轉法輪處、菩提樹處、初忉利下處、大神變處，此四處諸佛皆定，餘處不定。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
The place of first turning the Dharma wheel, the place of the Bodhi tree, the place of the first descent from Trāyastriṃśa[^23], and the place of the Great Miracles[^24]—these four places are fixed for all Buddhas; the remaining places are not fixed.

</div>

<div class="chinese-source">
又除轉法輪一處，其三處決定。

Further, aside from the single place of turning the Dharma wheel, the other three places are determined.

<div class="chinese-source">
「三七日」者，舊云「思理教等」，又云「勸誡等」。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
As for “three sevens of days”: older explanations say “thinking of principle and teaching, etc.”; others say “admonishing, etc.”
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
瑤師云：「事之至深，至聖猶思而後行。一七思佛智微妙，二[4]七思眾生根性不同，三七思法藥萬品，即舉偈證之：『我所得智慧，微妙最第一，眾生諸根鈍，云何而可度？』」
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Master Yao[^25] says: “When a matter is extremely deep, even the utmost sage still thinks and only then acts. The first seven [days] he thinks of the subtlety of Buddha‑wisdom; the second seven he thinks of the differences in living beings’ faculties; the third seven he thinks of the myriad kinds of Dharma‑medicine. He then cites a verse as proof: ‘The wisdom I have obtained is subtle, most foremost; living beings’ faculties are dull—how could they be saved?’”
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
今明佛在法身之地寂而常照，恒以佛眼洞覽無遺，豈始至道場淹留三七方思此事？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Now we clarify: the Buddha abides in the ground of the dharmakāya, quiescent yet constantly illuminating; he always uses the Buddha‑eye to look through without omission. How could it be only after arriving at the place of enlightenment that he lingered for three sevens and then thought these matters?
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
言三七者，明有所表也，表佛初欲三周說法，故假言三七耳。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Saying “three sevens” indicates a symbolic meaning: it symbolizes that the Buddha at first wished to preach the Dharma in three cycles; therefore he uses the provisional expression “three sevens.”
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
初七思法說，次七思譬說，後七思因緣說，皆無機不得，是故息大施小也，此偏就圓教大乘為釋耳。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
The first seven he thinks of Dharma‑exposition; the next seven he thinks of parable‑exposition; the last seven he thinks of causation‑exposition. In each, there was no capacity and thus it could not be attained; therefore he stops the Great and applies the Small. This explanation is specifically from the standpoint of the Perfect Teaching’s Great Vehicle.[^26]
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
若通途約大乘釋者，初七思惟欲說圓教大乘，次七思惟欲說別教，後七思惟欲說通教大乘，皆無機不得，是故息大說三藏三乘，為方便之化也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
If one broadly interprets it in terms of the Great Vehicle: in the first seven he thinks to preach the Perfect Teaching’s Great Vehicle[^26]; in the next seven he thinks to preach the Distinct Teaching[^27]; in the last seven he thinks to preach the Shared Teaching’s Great Vehicle[^28]. All lacked capacity and could not be attained; therefore he stops the Great and speaks the Tripiṭaka Three Vehicles[^29] as expedient transformation.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
觀心釋者，初欲觀中道，中道妙難觀不得；次欲觀即假，即假觀分別智難生不得；後欲觀即空，即空巧度又不得，方觀方便析法小觀也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
In the contemplation‑of‑mind explanation: first he wished to contemplate the Middle Way, but the Middle Way is subtle and difficult to contemplate and thus not attained; next he wished to contemplate “provisionality‑as‑such,” but the discriminating wisdom of that contemplation was difficult to generate and not attained; last he wished to contemplate “emptiness‑as‑such,” but the skillful crossing of that contemplation was again not attained—therefore he then contemplates the expedient, analytic, Small‑Vehicle contemplation.

## II. NO CAPACITY FOR THE GREAT (Lines 36-39; CBETA 005:36–39)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
從「眾生諸根鈍」下，第二，三行，明無機。又為三：初，半行，明障重；次「如斯」下，第二，半行，明不堪聞；「爾時梵王」者下，第三，有二行，明諸梵雖請說，大佛知無機，所以不說。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
From “living beings’ faculties are dull” onward, the second: three lines clarify the absence of capacity. It is again three: first, half a line clarifies heavy obstructions; next, from “thus” onward, the second—half a line—clarifies that they cannot bear to hear; under “at that time, the Brahmā king,” the third—two lines—clarifies that although the Brahmās requested the teaching, the Great Buddha knew there was no capacity, and therefore did not speak.
</div>
</div>

## III. THINKING OF CEASING THE TEACHING (Lines 38-39; CBETA 005:38–39)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「我即自思惟」下，第二，有二行，明念欲息化，又二：初，一行半，明無機強說，聞則有損；後，半行，正明息化。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
From “I immediately thought to myself” onward, the second: two lines clarify the thought of ceasing transformation. It is again two: first, one and a half lines clarify that if one forcefully speaks the Great when there is no capacity, hearing will cause harm; last, half a line directly clarifies ceasing the transformation.
</div>

## IV. USING EXPEDIENTS (Lines 40-45; CBETA 005:40–45)

<div class="english-translation">
In the prior ten lines there are four: first, one line makes clear the fitting adaptation of the Three Vehicles[^2]; next, below “Thus I think,” the second, six and a half lines make clear that there is capacity; next, below “Thinking thus,” the third, one and a half lines make clear the application of transformation; next, below “This is called,” the fourth, one line makes clear acceptance and practice.[5]

</div>
<div class="english-translation">
“Seeking/Thinking” means: he thinks that although those beings have no Great capacity, they cannot be permanently abandoned; one must use expedients[^32] to entice and rescue them. It is not that he completely did not know to “open the three” (teach three vehicles); rather, he wished to draw them to be the same as the Buddhas, therefore it is called “seeking/thinking.”

Below “Since you already know,” the next one and a half lines briefly give prediction: above, three clauses explain that they have understanding; the middle clause explains they have no doubt; the latter half‑verse explains that they receive prediction.

# CHAPTER 3: THE PARABLE (Lines 83-253; CBETA 005:83–253)

## I. GENERAL EXPLANATION OF "PARABLE" (Lines 83-85; CBETA 005:83–85)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
[4]先總釋，「譬」者比況也，「喻」者曉訓也，託此比彼，寄淺訓深...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**General Explanation ([Zǒng Shì]):**<br>
*   **"Pì" (Semblance/Comparison):** Means comparing (*Bǐkuàng*).<br>
*   **"Yù" (Illustration):** Means enlightening instruction (*Xiǎoxùn*).<br>
It means entrusting "this" to compare to "that"; lodging the shallow to instruct the deep.<br>
Because the High Roots heard the Dharma and attained enlightenment, but the Medium and Lower streams held onto delusion and were not dismissed (*Wèi Qiǎn*), the Great Compassion is ceaseless and Clever Wisdom unlimited. Thus, He moves the tree to instruct the wind, and raises a fan to illustrate the moon, causing them to understand. Thus it is called "Parable."
</div>
</div>

## II. EXPLANATION VIA TEACHINGS (Lines 90+)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
約教解者，佛意本讚佛乘，為物不堪，尋念先佛大悲方便，趣於鹿苑稱讚三車... 此三藏教中譬喻也... 《大品》云：「二乘如螢火，菩薩如日光。」此別教中譬喻也...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Explanation via Teachings (*Yuē Jiào Jiě*):**<br>
1.  **Tripitaka Teaching Parable:** The Buddha intended to praise the Buddha Vehicle, but beings were incapable. Seeking past Buddhas' expedients, He went to Deer Park (*Lù Yuàn*) to praise the Three Carts. Śrāvakas save themselves; Bodhisattvas drive the ox to transport others out of the fire.<br>
2.  **Shared Teaching Parable:** The Three People all fear the burning. Śravakas are like deer (fleeing alone); Pratyekabuddhas like the doe (looking back); Bodhisattvas like the Great Elephant (defending against arrows and leading the herd out).<br>
3.  **Distinct Teaching Parable:** The Two Vehicles are like fireflies; Bodhisattvas are like sunlight.<br>
4.  **Perfect Teaching Parable:** "As soon as they see my body and hear my teaching, they all trust and accept." Like the *Avataṃsaka*, matter itself is Truth; no parable is needed. But for those who have not entered, for 40+ years He used different expedients. Today in the Royal City (*Wáng Chéng*), He decisively speaks the Great Vehicle.

## III. SHARIPUTRA'S NARRATIVE (Lines 92-125; CBETA 005:92–125)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
文有二：一、經家敘，二、身子自陳。敘為二：謂內解、外儀...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
The text has two parts: (1) The Sutra Narrator's description; (2) Shariputra's own statement.<br>
The Narration has two parts: **Inner Understanding** (*Nèi Jiě*) and **Outer Demeanor** (*Wài Yí*).<br>
**Inner Understanding:** "Joy in the mind" is called *Xǐ*; when joy moves the physical form, it is called *Yǒngyuè* (Dancing/Leaping).<br>
Hearing the Wonderful Dharma from the Wonderful Person and obtaining Wonderful Understanding—if one encounters even one [of these], one would rejoice; how much more so when all **Three Joys** are complete?<br>
1.  **Worldly Joy:** Inner and outer harmony causing happiness.<br>
2.  **Person Joy:** Abandoning the "Poor Service" (Hinayana) and accepting the "Rich Family Inheritance" (Mahayana). "Today I know I am truly a Buddha Son."<br>
3.  **Antidote Joy:** Worry and regret are banished; doubts are removed. "I have attained extinction of outflows; hearing this also removes grief and worry."<br>
4.  **Supreme Truth Joy:** "Peacefully abiding in Real Wisdom, I will definitely become a Buddha."
</div>
</div>

### Q&A: Why Rejoice Now? (Lines 94+)
<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
若苦忍明發、若究竟無學，先已得之，今不應重喜...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Objection:** If he already attained the clear arising of patience (*duḥkha-kṣānti*) or ultimate No-Learning (*aśaikṣa*), he attained [liberation] long ago; he should not rejoice again now. If the three people coincide in the "Wordless Way," though methods differ, the witness of Emptiness is identical. He attained it long ago.<br>
**Answer:**<br>
The previous Two Emptinesses were only an **Expedient Way**. The Provisional View (*Jiǎ Guān*) washes away the narrowness of the Two Vehicles; the Empty View (*Kōng Guān*) washes away the noise of mortals. Surpassing the evils of the Two Extremes, he obtains Great Joy.<br>
Relying on the Perfect Awakening, the **First Abode** (*Chū Zhù*) is called the **Abode of Joy** (*Huānxǐ Zhù*). The First Stage (*Bhūmi*) is called the **Stage of Joy**. Since Shariputra is of sharp roots, he must have "surpassed entry" (*Chāo Rù*) into this Joy.
</div>
</div>

### Outer Demeanor (Lines 100-110)
<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
敘外儀者，「即起合掌」名身領解...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**"Immediately rose and joined palms":** Physical understanding (*Shēn Lǐngjiě*).<br>
In the past, Provisional and Real were two (separate), like palms not joined. Now he understands "Provisional *is* Real," like two palms joining.<br>
**"Facing the Buddha":** In the past, Provisional was not the Buddha Cause, and Real was not the Buddha Fruit. Now he understands "Provisional *is* Real" and constitutes the Great Perfect Cause. Since Cause must tend towards Fruit, he "joins palms facing the Buddha."<br>
**"Gazing up at the Honored Face":** Expresses understanding of the Real. The Real is the Buddha-Realm, not an expedient dharma. Gazing with no other thought expresses opening the Buddha-Wisdom.
</div>
</div>

### Three Joys in the Text (Lines 110-118)
<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
偈有二十五行半，為三：初一行，頌標三喜...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**"Now from the World Honored One...":**<br>
1.  **Body Joy:** "I see the Buddha's Body."<br>
2.  **Mouth Joy:** "Hearing this Dharma Sound" (relying on Buddha's mouth).<br>
3.  **Mind Joy:** "Obtaining what I never had before" (My mind understands Buddha's mind).<br>
**Verses (25.5 lines):**<br>
*   **"Since Olden Times" (1.5 lines):** Praises "Body and Mind Joy" - not losing the Great Vehicle.<br>
*   **"I dwelt in mountain valleys" (11 lines):** Praises "Not Hearing the Dharma."<br>
    *   **"I grasped wrong views":** Ordinary people grasp wrong views; Two Vehicles grasp the "Nature of Dharma" (*Dharmatā*). Both fail to hear the [True] Dharma.<br>
*   **"But now I am self-aware" (9.5 lines):** Praises "Mind attaining Wonderful Understanding." Hearing "Shall become a Buddha" is the Cause; hearing "Five Buddhas' Ways are Same" is the Expedient.<br>
*   **"Hearing Buddha's Soft Voice" (2.5 lines):** Conclusion.
</div>
</div>

### Narrating the Accomplishment (Lines 118-125)
<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「爾時佛告舍利弗吾今」下，是第三，述成段...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**"At that time Buddha told Shariputra, I now...":** This is the section of **Narrating the Accomplishment** (*Shù Chéng*).<br>
The Buddha confirms Shariputra's understanding is not false.<br>
1.  **Previously Taught the Great:** Recounts the condition of seeing the Buddha.<br>
2.  **In the Middle, Forgot and Took Small:** Recounts the condition of grief/regret.<br>
3.  **Returned to Speak Great:** Recounts the condition of realization.<br>
**"Long Night followed me to receive learning":** Although the ignorance was not broken in the past, the "Understanding Cause" (*Liǎo Yīn*) was planted deep and never perished.<br>

### Q&A: Why Shariputra First? (Lines 126-133)
<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
問：迦葉、善吉諸大聲聞，尚未得解，四眾何人而先獲悟？<br>
答：四眾天人亦具三品，上根同身子，中下可知...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Question:** Kāśyapa, Subhūti, and other Great Śrāvakas have not yet attained understanding. Who among the Four Assemblies attained awakening first?<br>
**Answer:**<br>
The Four Assemblies of Devas and Humans also possess the Three Grades [of roots]. The Superior Roots are the same as Shariputra [in capacity]. Medium and Lower can be known [by inference].<br>
**Alternate Explanation:** Shariputra and Kāśyapa are all Provisional Actions (*Quán Xíng*); the Medium and Lower capacities are not yet opened. Thus Kāśyapa and Pūrna *manifest* as not understanding/not yet healed (*Wèi Yù*), as the *Vimalakīrti Sutra* says: "If living beings are not healed, the Bodhisattva is not healed."

# THE PARABLE FOR MEDIUM ROOTS (Lines 134-140; CBETA 005:134–140)

從「爾時舍利弗白佛」下，第二大段，為中根譬說。文有四品...

<div class="english-translation">
**From "At that time, Shariputra said to the Buddha":**<br>
This is the **Second Great Section** (*Dì-èr Dà Duàn*), the Parable Explanation for the **Medium Roots** (*Zhōng Gēn*). The text covers four chapters:<br>
1.  **Parable Chapter:** Correctly uses parables to Open Three and Reveal One.<br>
2.  **Faith and Understanding Chapter:** Clarifies the Medium Roots obtaining understanding.<br>
3.  **Medicinal Herbs Chapter:** The Tathāgata narrates/confirms their understanding.<br>
4.  **Prophecy Chapter:** Giving the prediction (*Vyākaraṇa*); the final decision.<br>
These four turns are all the **Parable Explanation**.<br>
(The subsequent four sections are the "Causal Connection Explanation" for Lower Roots, e.g., Kauṇḍinya and Ānanda).

## I. REQUEST AND ANSWER (Lines 136-146; CBETA 005:136–146)

<div class="bilingual-row">

<div class="english-translation">
**I. The Request (*Qǐng*):**<br>
1.  **Self-statement of No Doubt.**<br>
2.  **Stating peers have doubts:** "The Buddha constantly taught Three Teachings; now He speaks One Principle. This contradiction causes confusion."<br>
3.  **Universal Request for Four Assemblies:** "Excellent, World Honored One! speak the causes and conditions."<br>
**II. The Answer (*Dá*):**<br>
1.  **Initiation (*Fāqǐ*):**<br>
    *   **Supressing (*Yì*):** Scolding them for not understanding the previous "Real is for Bodhisattvas." "I already spoke clearly, why do you grasp the Teaching and remain confused?"<br>
    *   **Leading (*Yǐn*):** Comforting them. "Now I will use parables to clarify this meaning." If they can understand this, they are still called wise.

## II. THE PARABLE (Lines 147-150; CBETA 005:147–150)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
二譬喻說長行偈頌... 今為二：一總、二別。總譬有六...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
The Parable section has Prose and Verse. It is divided into **General Parable** (*Zǒng Pì*) and **Specific Parable** (*Bié Pì*).<br>
**The General Parable has Six Metaphors:**<br>
1.  **The Elder (*Zhǎngzhě*):** Parable for "Me" (Śākyamuni), the Lord of the Teaching.<br>
2.  **The House (*Shèzhái*):** Parable for the "Place" (The Three Worlds, which are insecure).<br>
3.  **One Door (*Yī Mén*):** Parable for the "Door of Declaring the Buddha Way."<br>
4.  **Five Hundred People:** Parable for "Living Beings" (The Sentient Beings of the Five Paths).<br>
5.  **Fire Arising:** Parable for the "Five Turbidities and Eight Sufferings" (Unsafe Dharmas).<br>

## III. SPECIFIC PARABLE: THE SIX METAPHORS (Lines 151-180; CBETA 005:151–180)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
[5]從「長者見是大火」下，是第二，別譬也... 長者譬為三：一、名行；二、位號；三、德業。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Narrator:** The "Specific Parable" (*Bié Pì*) begins here.<br>
**1. The Elder (*Zhǎngzhě*):** Analyzed in three aspects: Name-Action, Rank-Title, and Virtue-Karma.<br>
    *   **Name & Action:** "Name" implies Guest; "Action" implies Host. Limits (Frontiers) are the "Country" (Furthest); Governing Center is the "City" (Middle); Gathering places are "Villages" (Nearest). The Elder's name and action pervade all three. He is a "Truthful Great Man" whose inner deeds match the Tathāgata's Three Karmas.<br>
        *   **Current Interpretation:** "Country" = Reward Land (*Real Reward*); "City" = Convenience Land (*With Remainder*); "Village" = Together-Dwelling Land (*Tóngjū*). The Buddha's influence pervades all Three Lands.<br>
    *   **Rank-Title:** Worldly Elder has 10 Virtues (Noble Lineage, High Rank, Great Wealth, etc.). Out-of-World Elder (Buddha) is born from the True Reality of Three Worlds, fully possessed of Ten Titles, Ten Powers, etc.<br>
    *   **Virtue-Karma:** "Age Decayed/Old" (*Shuāi Mài*) represents the maturity of Wisdom and Severance virtues (Buddha's Disconnection Virtue).
</div>
</div>

### 2. The House and Fire (Lines 158+; CBETA 005:158+)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「財富」譬外德... 「田宅」別譬... 「門」又二：宅門、車門...「堂閣」下，譬上安隱對不安隱...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**2. The House (*Shèzhái*):** "Wealth" parallels External Virtue (Ten Powers). "Field" nourishes life (Samadhi nourishing Prajna). "House" shelters the body (Real Realm sheltering Wisdom).<br>
**"Wide and Large":** Represents the Three Worlds being vast. The Tathāgata manages them as a house.<br>
**3. One Door (*Yī Mén*):**<br>
*   **One:** The Single Principle/Truth.<br>
*   **Door:** The Teaching which leads to the Principle.<br>
*   **Interpretation:** The Teaching Door of the Three Vehicles (*Tripitaka*). But strictly speaking, the House Door is the "Exit" (Expedient teaching); the Cart Door is the "Entrance" (Perfect Teaching). If the exit door is the cart door, then the Three Carts initiated at the start are the same as the Great Cart given at the end.<br>
**4. Five Hundred People:** The Sentient Beings of the Five Paths.<br>
**5. Fire Specifics:**<br>
*   **Hall:** Desire Realm.<br>
*   **Pavilion (*Gé*):** Form and Formless Realms.<br>
*   **Walls:** Four Elements.<br>
*   **Decayed/Fallen:** Old age/decay.<br>
*   **Pillars/Base:** Life force.<br>
*   **Beams/Ridgepole:** Consciousness (*Manas*).<br>
*   **Fire Arising:** The Eight Sufferings pervasively burning the Four Elements and Four Births. "Suddenly" (*Hūrán*) implies originally non-existent, arising from Ignorance.
</div>
</div>

### 6. The Thirty Sons (Lines 158 end; CBETA 005:158)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
六、「長者諸子」下，三十子，譬上知眾生性欲...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**6. The Thirty Sons:** Parable for knowing the natures/desires.<br>
*   **10 Sons:** Bodhisattva nature.<br>
*   **20 Sons:** Two Vehicles (10 Śrāvaka + 10 Pratyekabuddha).<br>
Those with the "Nature to Enter the House of Law" are called Sons. The 500 (without this nature) are just "People."<br>
Alternatively: All 30 have the "Nature of Ten Wisdoms" (inner potential), but lack the "Nature of Real Wisdom" (manifestation).
</div>
</div>

### Seeing the Fire (Lines 172-180; CBETA 005:172–180)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
從「長者見是大火」下，是第二，別譬也... 一、明能見；二、明所見；三、明驚怖...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**The Elder Sees the Fire:**<br>
1.  **Able to See:** Buddha Eye views the Five Turbidities.<br>
2.  **Object Seen:** The Great Fire arising from four sides (Four Inverted Views: Impurity, Suffering, Impermanence, Non-self).<br>
3.  **Great Fear/Alarm:**<br>
    *   **Alarm (*Jīng*):** Compassion (*Maitrī*) noting they have no happiness.<br>
    *   **Fear (*Bù*):** Pity (*Karuṇā*) worrying about their suffering.<br>
**"I although am able to exit safely":** The Buddha, by Wisdom Power, finds the True Teaching and is not endangered by the Five Turbidities. He is "Outside" the burning.<br>
**"Teaching as Door":** If the Teaching is the Door, is the Teaching burned? [Discussion on whether Teaching is conditioned/unconditioned].<br>
**"Enjoying Play/Games":** Attaching to Views is "Play" (*Xī*); attaching to Love/Desire is "Games" (*Xì*). Or attaching to Four Views is Play; losing merit is Games. <br>
**"Unaware, Unknown, Not Alarmed, Not Afraid":**<br>
*   **Unaware (*Bù Jué*):** Not sensing the fire (suffering).<br>
*   **Unknown (*Bù Zhī*):** Not understanding it is hot (accumulation).<br>
*   **Not Alarmed:** Not fearing injury to body (Path).<br>
*   **Not Afraid:** Not worrying about death (Extinction).<br>
Basically: Lacking Hearing Wisdom = Unaware; Lacking Thinking Wisdom = Unknown.
</div>
</div>

### 3. Discarding the Table and Using Carts (Lines 182-198; CBETA 005:182–198)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
從「是長者作是思惟」下，是第二，捨几用車譬...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Narrator:** This section explains "Discarding the Table [and Chair] / Using Carts Parable" (*Shě Jī Yòng Chē Pì*).<br>
Previously, the Buddha intended to use the Great Teaching (Table/Chair) but found no capacity; now He uses the Small (Carts).<br>
**Two Approaches to Expedients:**<br>
1.  **Exhortation Door (*Quàn Mén*):** Using gentle encouragement (Siddhānta of Acting for Others). Corresponds to "Body and Hand Power."<br>
    *   **"Body":** Spiritual Power (Miracles) to carry/support.<br>
    *   **"Hand":** Wisdom Power to pull/extract.<br>
    *   **"Table and Chair" (*Yī Jiè Jī Àn*):** *Yī Jiè* is a foreign flower-container (or lapel/sash). *Jī Àn* is a table/bench. Metaphor for the Great Teaching's supports. Since beings couldn't use the Great Supports, He discarded them.<br>
2.  **Admonition Door (*Jiè Mén*):** Using warnings of suffering (Siddhānta of Counteracting).<br>
    *   **"Or they will fall and be burned":** Warning of the dangers of the Five Turbidities.<br>
    *   **"Narrow and Small Door":** The Principle is One (Pure), so "Narrow." The Teaching is subtle, so "Small." Beings cannot pass through the Great Logic.<br>
    *   **"ATTACHED TO PLAY (*Liànzhuó Xìchù*):** Attached to the Play of Views and Love.<br>
    *   **"FALLING (*Duòluò*):** Falling into the Three Paths due to slander or ignorance.<br>
**Using the Carts:**<br>
Since the Exhortation (Great) failed, He uses the Admonition (Small). He "Knows the Children's Prior Minds" (knowing they attach to small things) and "Each has their preferences" (Śrāvaka vs Pratyekabuddha).<br>
**"Rare Playthings" (*Wán-hào Xī Yǒu*):** The Three Vehicles are praised as rare to entice them.

2.  **"Brave and Sharp" (*Yǒng Ruì*):** Correspond to **Thinking Wisdom** (*Sī Huì*) / Expedient Path. Mind moves firmly.<br>
3.  **"Pushing and Shoving" (*Hù Xiāng Tuī Pái*):** Pushing against delusions. Correspond to **Warmth and Summit** stages (*Nuan/Ding*).<br>
4.  **"Racing" (*Jìng*):** Competing to grasp the Superior Principle. Correspond to **Patience** stage (*Rěn*).<br>
5.  **"Together" (*Gòng*):** Correspond to **World's First Dharma** (*Laukikāgra*). Together viewing the One Truth.<br>
6.  **"Scrambling/Running Out" (*Chízóu*):** Running out of the Burning House. Correspond to **Path of Vision** (*Darśana-mārga*) and **Path of Cultivation** (*Bhāvanā-mārga*). Cutting off delusions and exiting the Three Worlds.<br>
**Contemplation Interpretation:** The "Middle Way Correct Views" directly view Real Aspect. The Mind and Dharma matching is "Suited Wishes." The Boundless Object makes the view "Brave." Pushing against the duality of Empty/Provisional is "Pushing."

### 5. Giving the Great Carts (Lines 200+; CBETA 005:200+)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「是時長者見諸子等」下，是別譬中第三等賜諸子大車譬...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**"At that time the Elder saw the sons...":** This is the **Equally Bestowing Great Carts Parable**.<br>
**Four parts:**<br>
1.  **Father Rejoicing at Escape:** The Buddha rejoices that beings have escaped the sufferings of the Three Worlds.<br>
2.  **Sons Asking for Carts:** Beings (or Disciples) asking for the promised Nirvana (Reward).<br>
3.  **Equally Bestowing:** Giving the One Buddha Vehicle to all, not the Three Vehicles originally promised.<br>
4.  **Sons Rejoicing:** Obtaining the Great Vehicle.<br>
**"Sitting in the Open Space" (*Lù Dì Pì*):**<br>
*   **Old Interpretation:** "Four Crossroads" (*Sì Qú Dào*) = Four Truths. "Open Space" = Extinction of Sufferings.<br>
*   **Current Interpretation:** "Open Ground" (*Lù Dì*) means the exhaustion of delusions of the Three Worlds. Having exited the House (Three Worlds), they sit on the ground of Emptiness. "Sitting" implies not advancing further (into the Provisional/Middle), hence "Sitting in Open Space" represents the Arhat's Nirvana (Peace/Safety).

### 6. No Falsehood (Lines 221-253; CBETA 005:221–253)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「舍利弗於汝意云何」下，[1]第四，長者無虛妄譬...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**"Shariputra, what do you think?":** This is the fourth part, the **Elder Has No Falsehood Parable** (*Zhǎngzhě Wú Xūwàng Pì*).<br>
**Metaphor:** "Equal Gift of Great Carts" (Giving the One Vehicle).<br>
**Question:** The Father promised Three but gave One. Is this a lie?<br>
**Answer:** No. "Not empty/false" (*Bù Xū*).<br>
1.  **Sutra Explanation:** The Buddha asks Shariputra: "Is this Elder guilty of the falsehood of vain speech?" Shariputra answers: "No, World Honored One." reason: "He caused the sons to attain peace and save their lives."<br>
2.  **Saving Life is not Falsehood:** Even if he gave no carts at all, saving their lives from fire is already a great benefit. How much more so when he gives a better cart!<br>
3.  **The "Lying" Objection:**<br>
    *   **Objection:** He promised Goat/Deer carts but didn't give them. He gave an Ox cart which wasn't promised. The promise and gift don't match -> Falsehood.<br>
    *   **Resolution:**<br>
        *   **Specific:** The "Body" of the vehicle (Wisdom) acts as the Goat/Deer cart "Function." The Great Cart *contains* the functions of the Three. Thus he gave *what serves as* the Three, plus more. Not a lie.<br>
        *   **General:** The Father's intent was always to save the sons. The "Means" (promise) achieved the "End" (safety). Expedients are not lies when they lead to Truth.<br>
**Verse (Lines 240+):**<br>
"The Elder has no Falsehood" (*Zhǎngzhě Wú Xū-wàng*).<br>
"He possesses Seven Treasures/Carts."<br>
The Verse reiterates that the Buddha, possessing immeasurable wealth (Dharma), gives the same Great Vehicle to all beings, leading them to the same Buddha-Ground.
