## I. CONCLUSION OF EXPEDIENT MEANS VERSES (Lines 13-35; CBETA 005:13–35)

### 1. Using Expedients (Lines 13-19)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
[7]從「我始坐道場」下，第二十七行半，頌施方便化，就此為二...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**From "I first sat at the Way-place" (*Wǒ shǐ zuò dàochǎng*):**<br>
This section of 27.5 lines praises the **Application of Expedients in Teaching** (*Shī Fāngbiàn Huà*). It is divided into two parts:<br>
23: 1.  **First 6.5 lines:** Explains the thought of using the Great Vehicle (*Dàshèng*) but finding it inapplicable.<br>
24: 2.  **Next 21 lines:** Following the Buddhas to use Three Vehicles.[^1]<br>
25: 
26: [^1]: Numbers in brackets like [7] are CBETA source line anchors/apparatus markers, not missing text.
### 2. Q&A: Why the Five Companions? (Lines 20-27)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
問：何故初為五人轉法輪？<br>
答：人先見諦故、人是現見故、人為證故、佛所行事業與人同故，諸天從人中得善利故、人中有四眾故。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Question:** Why did He turn the Dharma Wheel for the **Five Persons** (*Wǔ Rén*) first?<br>
**Answer:**<br>
1.  Humans see the Truth (*Satyas*) first.<br>
2.  Humans are visible to manifest [the Teaching].<br>
3.  Humans serve as witnesses.<br>
4.  The Buddha's deeds/career are the same as humans.<br>
5.  All Devas obtain good benefits from among humans.<br>
6.  Among humans, there are the Four Assemblies.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
輪王出世聲至他化自在... 佛得道聲至首陀會，何故爾？<br>
答：善業、名譽業、稱讚父母師長業，有上中下故爾也...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Question:** When a Wheel-Turning King appears, his voice reaches the *Paranirmitavaśavartin* Heaven. When Kaundinya attained the Way, the voice reached the Brahma Heaven. When the Buddha attained the Way, the voice reached *Śuddhāvāsa* (Pure Abodes). Why is this?<br>
**Answer:** Good Karma, Reputation Karma, and Praising Parents/Teachers Karma have Superior, Intermediate, and Inferior grades.
</div>

### 3. The Three Weeks of Thinking (Lines 32-35)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
初轉法輪處... 「三七日」者，舊云「思理教等」... 今明佛在法身之地寂而常照...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Four Fixed Places:** The place of First Turning the Wheel, the Bodhi Tree, the place of Descending from Trayastriṃśa, and the place of Great Miracles—these four are fixed for all Buddhas.<br>
**"Three Seven Days" (21 Days):**<br>
*   **Old Interpretation:** He thought about Principle and Teaching, etc.<br>
*   **Current Explanation:** The Buddha, on the ground of the Dharma Body, is Silent yet Constantly Shining (*jì ér cháng zhào*). He uses the Buddha Eye to view all without omission. How could He wait until arriving at the Way Place to spend 21 days thinking about this?<br>
"Three Seven Days" indicates a symbolic meaning:<br>
1.  **First Week:** Thinking of the **Dharma Explanation** (*Fǎshuō*).<br>
2.  **Second Week:** Thinking of the **Parable Explanation** (*Pìyù shuō*).<br>
3.  **Third Week:** Thinking of the **Causal Connection Explanation** (*Yīnyuán shuō*).<br>
Seeing no capacity [for the Great], He stopped the Great and applied the Small.
</div>
</div>

## II. NO CAPACITY FOR THE GREAT (Lines 36-39; CBETA 005:36–39)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
從「眾生諸根鈍」下，第二，三行，明無機... 初，半行，明障重... 次「如斯」下，明不堪聞...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**From "Living beings' roots are dull" (*Zhòngshēng zhūgēn dùn*):**<br>
This section of 3 lines clarifies the **Absence of Capacity** (*Wú Jī*).<br>
1.  **First half-line:** Clarifies heavy obstructions (Severe Obstacles).<br>
2.  **Next:** Clarifies they are unworthy/unable to hear (*Bùkān wén*).<br>
3.  **"At that time, Brahma King"**: Clarifies that although the Brahma Kings requested the teaching, the Great Buddha knew there was no capacity, so He did not speak.
</div>
</div>

---

## III. THINKING OF CEASING THE TEACHING (Lines 38-39; CBETA 005:38–39)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「我即自思惟」下... 明念欲息化... 明無機強說，聞則有損...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**From "I immediately thought to myself":**<br>
Clarifies the thought of ceasing the transformation (*Xī Huà*).<br>
1.  **First 1.5 lines:** If one speaks the Great forcefully when there is no capacity, hearing it will cause harm (loss).<br>
2.  **Last half-line:** Properly clarifies stopping the teaching (entering Nirvana).
</div>
</div>

## IV. USING EXPEDIENTS (Lines 40-45; CBETA 005:40–45)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
從「尋念過去佛」下，第二，有十一行... 頌上「於一佛乘方便說三」也...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**From "Seeking/Thinking of Past Buddhas" (*Xúnniàn Guòqù Fó*):**<br>
This section of 11 lines praises "Within the One Buddha Vehicle, expediently speaking of Three."<br>
It has two parts: (1) Correctly clarifying that conversion is possible (*Huà Dé* - 10 lines); (2) Resolving Doubts (1 line).
</div>
</div>

### 1. Thinking of the Three Vehicles (Line 40)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「尋念」者，念彼雖無大機，不容永捨，要以方便而誘濟之... 故云尋念也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**"Seeking/Thinking" (*Xúnniàn*):**<br>
Thinking that although they lack Great Capacity, they cannot be abandoned forever. One must use expedients to entice and rescue them.<br>
It is not that He didn't know to "Open the Three" [before], but He wishes to cite/draw parallels with All Buddhas, hence "Seeking/Thinking."
</div>
</div>

### 2. The Praises of Buddhas (Lines 40-41)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「作是思惟」下... 明有小機... 初，四行半，明諸佛歎...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**From "Making this thought":** Clarifies there is **Small Capacity** (*Xiǎo Jī*).<br>
Since the Great Teaching had no capacity, the Buddhas did not praise. Now that He wishes to speak the Small to curve/bend to meet the roots, enabling ultimate liberation, the Buddhas praise Him.<br>
**"Excellent!" (*Shànzāi*):** The Buddhas praise Śākyamuni for being able to hide the Real and establish the Provisional.<br>
**"First Guide" (*Dìyī Dǎoshī*):** Because He dispenses Three for the sake of the One, leading into Buddha Wisdom.
</div>
</div>

### 3. Accepting and Practicing (Lines 41-45)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「諸法寂滅相，不可以言宣」下... 是名轉法輪...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**"The Mark of Tranquil Extinction of Dharmas cannot be expressed in words":**<br>
This refers to the Principle of the Middle Way without Nature (*Zhōngdào Wúxìng*). This principle is not a number and cannot be spoken.<br>
*   Now, using expedients, He makes a "Three Vehicle" explanation.<br>
*   It is neither born nor extinguished, yet He makes a "Birth and Extinction" explanation.<br>
*   The Principle of Partial Truth (*Piānzhēn*) is also beyond words, but He makes a "Four Gates" explanation.<br>
**"First for the Five Persons (Ajñāta-Kauṇḍinya etc.) preaching Impermanence":** This is the **Gate of Existence** (*Yǒu Mén*).<br>

---

## V. RESOLVING DOUBTS (Lines 45-46; CBETA 005:45–46)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「從久遠劫來」下... 是釋疑... 疑師... 疑弟子...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**From "Since Long Distant Kalpas" (*Cóng jiǔyuǎn jié lái*):**<br>
This section resolves doubts (*Shì Yí*).<br>
1.  **Doubt regarding the Teacher:** "Did the Buddha initially not understand the capacity, and only knew the roots after thinking of past Buddhas?"<br>
    *   **Explanation:** It's not that He didn't know to use expedients; He specifically wanted to cite/align with the past Buddhas. It is not that He only knew after thinking. From long distant kalpas, He has seen their delight in the Small.<br>
2.  **Doubt regarding the Disciples:** "How could living beings, hearing briefly in one lifetime, immediately testify to Arhatship?"<br>
    *   **Explanation:** From long distant kalpas, He has praised and shown them [the path]. Because it matches their original habits (*Běn Xí*), they attained the Way quickly.
</div>
</div>

## VI. REVEALING THE REAL (Lines 45-60; CBETA 005:45–60)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
從「我見佛子等」下，第三，有六行，頌上顯實... 文具四一...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**From "I see the Buddha Sons etc." (*Wǒ jiàn Fózǐ děng*):**<br>
This section of 6 lines praises the "Revealing of the Real" (*Xiǎn Shí*). The text possesses the **Four Onenesses** (*Sì Yī*):<br>
1.  **"I see Buddha Sons" (2 lines):** Praises the **Oneness of Person** (*Rén Yī*). Three Vehicle practitioners are all Buddha Sons.<br>
2.  **"I immediately make this thought" (1 line):** Praises the **Oneness of Principle** (*Lǐ Yī*). Speaking Buddha Wisdom corresponds to the Omniscient Wisdom (*Sarvajñā*) mentioned above.<br>
3.  **"Śāriputra should know" (2 lines):** Praises the **Oneness of Teaching** (*Jiào Yī*). "Only speaking the Unsurpassed Way."<br>
4.  **"Bodhisattvas hearing this Dharma" (1 line):** Praises the **Oneness of Practice** (*Xíng Yī*). "All shall become Buddhas."
</div>
</div>

### Detailed Analysis of the Revelation
<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
更就此文為四意：初，二行，明大乘機發，亦云索果... 次... 明佛歡喜... 次... 正明顯實... 次... 受行悟入也...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
This text has four meanings:<br>
1.  **Great Capacity Manifests (Seeking the Fruit):** (2 lines) The obstruction is removed, and the mechanism (*Jī*) triggers.<br>
2.  **Buddha's Joy:** (2 lines, 1 phrase) "Because living beings obtain Great Vehicle benefits."<br>
3.  **Correctly Revealing the Real:** (3 phrases) "Abandoning the partial/crooked."<br>
4.  **Accepting and Practicing:** (1 line) "Doubt removed."
</div>
</div>

### Three Meanings of "Seeking" (*Suǒ*)
<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
索有三意：一、大機有感果之義... 二、情中密求... 三、發言索...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Seeking (*Suǒ*) has three meanings:**<br>
1.  **Functional Seeking:** The Great Mechanic (*Dà Jī*) has the sense of stimulating the Fruit. This is seeking within the Mechanism/Capacity itself.<br>
2.  **Secret Seeking:** Seeking secretly in one's feelings ("Will I get it or not?").<br>
3.  **Verbal Seeking:** Specifically the "Three Requests" spoken aloud.<br>
In the past teaching, there were the first two seekings, but no spoken request. Today, all three are present.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
問：昔出宅索三，是機、情索者，文云如先所許，此乃求三，何關求一？<br>
答：出外不見，必有異途，將昔許三以求異意耳，亦得是索一也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Question:** In the Parable, when they leave the Burning House and seek the Three Carts, this is Mechanism and Feeling seeking. The text says "As promised before." This is seeking Three; how does it relate to Seeking One?<br>
**Answer:** When they get outside and do not see [the Three], there must be a different path. Taking the "Three Promised in the Past" to seek a different intention is also equivalent to Seeking the One.
</div>
</div>

### Resolving the Bodhisattva's Doubt (Lines 61-63)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
問：菩薩何疑？<br>
答：三藏說三僧祇未斷惑，一斷即入真；通教說菩薩斷正留習，習盡即成佛... 今聞《法華》掃蕩諸疑無復遺芥。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Question:** What doubt does the Bodhisattva have?<br>
**Answer:**<br>
*   **Tripitaka Teaching:** Says one spends three *asaṃkhyeya* kalpas without cutting off delusions; once cut, one enters Truth.<br>
*   **Shared Teaching:** Says Bodhisattvas cut the True [Delusions] but retain the Habits (*Xí*); when Habits are exhausted, they become Buddha.<br>
Having first heard the brief explanation saying "All are Expedients" (*Xī yún fāngbiàn*), they wonder: "The True [Attainment] of the past, the Completion of the past—where does it stand now?"<br>
Also: "The Three Vehicles study the One Path together; why is there a distinction?"<br>
Now, hearing the *Lotus Sutra*, all doubts are swept away without a mustered seed remaining.
</div>
</div>

## VII. PRAISING THE DHARMA AS RARE (Lines 67-68; CBETA 005:67–68)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
從「如三世諸佛」下，第四，五行半，頌上歎法希有...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**From "Like the Buddhas of the Three Worlds":**<br>
This section of 5.5 lines praises the "Dharma as Rare" (*Xī Yǒu*).<br>
**"Saying the Method of No Discrimination" (*Shuō wú fēnbié fǎ*):** Citing the Buddhas to reveal the Real. The Real cuts off the path of language; how could it have rituals/formulas? Originally, Provisional and Real had no discrimination. It was only for dull roots that He discriminated Provisional and Real. Now, returning to awakening that the Three and One are Non-Dual, we know the Buddha speaks of Three and One without discrimination.
</div>
</div>

---

## VIII. EXHORTING FAITH (Lines 69-82; CBETA 005:69–82)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
從「汝等勿有疑」下，第五，二行半，頌上不虛... 勿於可信人生疑... 勿於可信法起疑...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**From "You etc. do not have doubts":**<br>
This section of 2.5 lines praises "No Falsehood" (*Bù Xū*). It exhorts:<br>
1.  **Do not doubt the Trustworthy Person (*Kěxìn Rén*).**<br>
2.  **Do not doubt the Trustworthy Dharma (*Kěxìn Fǎ*).**<br>
**"Dharma King" (*Fǎ Wáng*):** If a worldly king's words are non-dual, how could the Dharma King speak falsely? Even if Expedients are temporary/provisional, how could the Truth be a lie?
</div>
</div>

### Selecting the Audience (Lines 73-82)
<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
今明從五濁下，第六，六行，頌上揀眾...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**From "Five Turbidities" (*Wǔ Zhuó*) down:**<br>
This section of 6 lines praises the "Selecting of the Audience" (*Jiǎn Zhòng*) and "Exhorting Faith" (*Dūn Xìn*).<br>
*   **"Five Turbidities":** Praises selecting against "Non-Disciples." If they delight in desires, they practice Mara's deeds; how can they be Buddha's disciples?<br>
*   **"Finally not seeking Buddha Way":** Praises selecting against "Overweening Pride" (*Zēngshàngmàn*).<br>
*   **"Future Generation Evil Persons":** Praises that those who understand the meaning after the Tathāgata's extinction are hard to find.<br>
*   **"Having Shame and Purity":** Praises that if they meet other Buddhas, they will attain decision/understanding (*Jué Liǎo*).
</div>

# CHAPTER 3: THE PARABLE (Lines 83-253; CBETA 005:83–253)

## I. GENERAL EXPLANATION OF "PARABLE" (Lines 83-85; CBETA 005:83–85)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
[4]先總釋，「譬」者比況也，「喻」者曉訓也，託此比彼，寄淺訓深...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**General Explanation ([Zǒng Shì]):**<br>
*   **"Pì" (Semblance/Comparison):** Means comparing (*Bǐkuàng*).<br>
*   **"Yù" (Illustration):** Means enlightening instruction (*Xiǎoxùn*).<br>
It means entrusting "this" to compare to "that"; lodging the shallow to instruct the deep.<br>
Because the High Roots heard the Dharma and attained enlightenment, but the Medium and Lower streams held onto delusion and were not dismissed (*Wèi Qiǎn*), the Great Compassion is ceaseless and Clever Wisdom unlimited. Thus, He moves the tree to instruct the wind, and raises a fan to illustrate the moon, causing them to understand. Thus it is called "Parable."
</div>
</div>

## II. EXPLANATION VIA TEACHINGS (Lines 90+)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
約教解者，佛意本讚佛乘，為物不堪，尋念先佛大悲方便，趣於鹿苑稱讚三車... 此三藏教中譬喻也... 《大品》云：「二乘如螢火，菩薩如日光。」此別教中譬喻也...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Explanation via Teachings (*Yuē Jiào Jiě*):**<br>
1.  **Tripitaka Teaching Parable:** The Buddha intended to praise the Buddha Vehicle, but beings were incapable. Seeking past Buddhas' expedients, He went to Deer Park (*Lù Yuàn*) to praise the Three Carts. Śrāvakas save themselves; Bodhisattvas drive the ox to transport others out of the fire.<br>
2.  **Shared Teaching Parable:** The Three People all fear the burning. Śravakas are like deer (fleeing alone); Pratyekabuddhas like the doe (looking back); Bodhisattvas like the Great Elephant (defending against arrows and leading the herd out).<br>
3.  **Distinct Teaching Parable:** The Two Vehicles are like fireflies; Bodhisattvas are like sunlight.<br>
4.  **Perfect Teaching Parable:** "As soon as they see my body and hear my teaching, they all trust and accept." Like the *Avataṃsaka*, matter itself is Truth; no parable is needed. But for those who have not entered, for 40+ years He used different expedients. Today in the Royal City (*Wáng Chéng*), He decisively speaks the Great Vehicle.
</div>

## III. SHARIPUTRA'S NARRATIVE (Lines 92-125; CBETA 005:92–125)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
文有二：一、經家敘，二、身子自陳。敘為二：謂內解、外儀...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
The text has two parts: (1) The Sutra Narrator's description; (2) Shariputra's own statement.<br>
The Narration has two parts: **Inner Understanding** (*Nèi Jiě*) and **Outer Demeanor** (*Wài Yí*).<br>
**Inner Understanding:** "Joy in the mind" is called *Xǐ*; when joy moves the physical form, it is called *Yǒngyuè* (Dancing/Leaping).<br>
Hearing the Wonderful Dharma from the Wonderful Person and obtaining Wonderful Understanding—if one encounters even one [of these], one would rejoice; how much more so when all **Three Joys** are complete?<br>
1.  **Worldly Joy:** Inner and outer harmony causing happiness.<br>
2.  **Person Joy:** Abandoning the "Poor Service" (Hinayana) and accepting the "Rich Family Inheritance" (Mahayana). "Today I know I am truly a Buddha Son."<br>
3.  **Antidote Joy:** Worry and regret are banished; doubts are removed. "I have attained extinction of outflows; hearing this also removes grief and worry."<br>
4.  **Supreme Truth Joy:** "Peacefully abiding in Real Wisdom, I will definitely become a Buddha."
</div>
</div>

### Q&A: Why Rejoice Now? (Lines 94+)
<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
若苦忍明發、若究竟無學，先已得之，今不應重喜...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Objection:** If he already attained the clear arising of patience (*duḥkha-kṣānti*) or ultimate No-Learning (*aśaikṣa*), he attained [liberation] long ago; he should not rejoice again now. If the three people coincide in the "Wordless Way," though methods differ, the witness of Emptiness is identical. He attained it long ago.<br>
**Answer:**<br>
The previous Two Emptinesses were only an **Expedient Way**. The Provisional View (*Jiǎ Guān*) washes away the narrowness of the Two Vehicles; the Empty View (*Kōng Guān*) washes away the noise of mortals. Surpassing the evils of the Two Extremes, he obtains Great Joy.<br>
Relying on the Perfect Awakening, the **First Abode** (*Chū Zhù*) is called the **Abode of Joy** (*Huānxǐ Zhù*). The First Stage (*Bhūmi*) is called the **Stage of Joy**. Since Shariputra is of sharp roots, he must have "surpassed entry" (*Chāo Rù*) into this Joy.
</div>
</div>

### Outer Demeanor (Lines 100-110)
<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
敘外儀者，「即起合掌」名身領解...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**"Immediately rose and joined palms":** Physical understanding (*Shēn Lǐngjiě*).<br>
In the past, Provisional and Real were two (separate), like palms not joined. Now he understands "Provisional *is* Real," like two palms joining.<br>
**"Facing the Buddha":** In the past, Provisional was not the Buddha Cause, and Real was not the Buddha Fruit. Now he understands "Provisional *is* Real" and constitutes the Great Perfect Cause. Since Cause must tend towards Fruit, he "joins palms facing the Buddha."<br>
**"Gazing up at the Honored Face":** Expresses understanding of the Real. The Real is the Buddha-Realm, not an expedient dharma. Gazing with no other thought expresses opening the Buddha-Wisdom.
</div>
</div>

### Three Joys in the Text (Lines 110-118)
<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
偈有二十五行半，為三：初一行，頌標三喜...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**"Now from the World Honored One...":**<br>
1.  **Body Joy:** "I see the Buddha's Body."<br>
2.  **Mouth Joy:** "Hearing this Dharma Sound" (relying on Buddha's mouth).<br>
3.  **Mind Joy:** "Obtaining what I never had before" (My mind understands Buddha's mind).<br>
**Verses (25.5 lines):**<br>
*   **"Since Olden Times" (1.5 lines):** Praises "Body and Mind Joy" - not losing the Great Vehicle.<br>
*   **"I dwelt in mountain valleys" (11 lines):** Praises "Not Hearing the Dharma."<br>
    *   **"I grasped wrong views":** Ordinary people grasp wrong views; Two Vehicles grasp the "Nature of Dharma" (*Dharmatā*). Both fail to hear the [True] Dharma.<br>
*   **"But now I am self-aware" (9.5 lines):** Praises "Mind attaining Wonderful Understanding." Hearing "Shall become a Buddha" is the Cause; hearing "Five Buddhas' Ways are Same" is the Expedient.<br>
*   **"Hearing Buddha's Soft Voice" (2.5 lines):** Conclusion.
</div>
</div>

### Narrating the Accomplishment (Lines 118-125)
<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「爾時佛告舍利弗吾今」下，是第三，述成段...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**"At that time Buddha told Shariputra, I now...":** This is the section of **Narrating the Accomplishment** (*Shù Chéng*).<br>
The Buddha confirms Shariputra's understanding is not false.<br>
1.  **Previously Taught the Great:** Recounts the condition of seeing the Buddha.<br>
2.  **In the Middle, Forgot and Took Small:** Recounts the condition of grief/regret.<br>
3.  **Returned to Speak Great:** Recounts the condition of realization.<br>
**"Long Night followed me to receive learning":** Although the ignorance was not broken in the past, the "Understanding Cause" (*Liǎo Yīn*) was planted deep and never perished.<br>

### Q&A: Why Shariputra First? (Lines 126-133)
<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
問：迦葉、善吉諸大聲聞，尚未得解，四眾何人而先獲悟？<br>
答：四眾天人亦具三品，上根同身子，中下可知...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Question:** Kāśyapa, Subhūti, and other Great Śrāvakas have not yet attained understanding. Who among the Four Assemblies attained awakening first?<br>
**Answer:**<br>
The Four Assemblies of Devas and Humans also possess the Three Grades [of roots]. The Superior Roots are the same as Shariputra [in capacity]. Medium and Lower can be known [by inference].<br>
**Alternate Explanation:** Shariputra and Kāśyapa are all Provisional Actions (*Quán Xíng*); the Medium and Lower capacities are not yet opened. Thus Kāśyapa and Pūrna *manifest* as not understanding/not yet healed (*Wèi Yù*), as the *Vimalakīrti Sutra* says: "If living beings are not healed, the Bodhisattva is not healed."

# THE PARABLE FOR MEDIUM ROOTS (Lines 134-140; CBETA 005:134–140)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
從「爾時舍利弗白佛」下，第二大段，為中根譬說。文有四品...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**From "At that time, Shariputra said to the Buddha":**<br>
This is the **Second Great Section** (*Dì-èr Dà Duàn*), the Parable Explanation for the **Medium Roots** (*Zhōng Gēn*). The text covers four chapters:<br>
1.  **Parable Chapter:** Correctly uses parables to Open Three and Reveal One.<br>
2.  **Faith and Understanding Chapter:** Clarifies the Medium Roots obtaining understanding.<br>
3.  **Medicinal Herbs Chapter:** The Tathāgata narrates/confirms their understanding.<br>
4.  **Prophecy Chapter:** Giving the prediction (*Vyākaraṇa*); the final decision.<br>
These four turns are all the **Parable Explanation**.<br>
(The subsequent four sections are the "Causal Connection Explanation" for Lower Roots, e.g., Kauṇḍinya and Ānanda).

**I. The Request (*Qǐng*):**<br>
1.  **Self-statement of No Doubt.**<br>

3.  **Universal Request for Four Assemblies:** "Excellent, World Honored One! speak the causes and conditions."<br>
**II. The Answer (*Dá*):**<br>
1.  **Initiation (*Fāqǐ*):**<br>
    *   **Supressing (*Yì*):** Scolding them for not understanding the previous "Real is for Bodhisattvas." "I already spoke clearly, why do you grasp the Teaching and remain confused?"<br>
    *   **Leading (*Yǐn*):** Comforting them. "Now I will use parables to clarify this meaning." If they can understand this, they are still called wise.

4.  **Five Hundred People:** Parable for "Living Beings" (The Sentient Beings of the Five Paths).<br>

## III. SPECIFIC PARABLE: THE SIX METAPHORS (Lines 151-180; CBETA 005:151–180)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
[5]從「長者見是大火」下，是第二，別譬也... 長者譬為三：一、名行；二、位號；三、德業。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Narrator:** The "Specific Parable" (*Bié Pì*) begins here.<br>
**1. The Elder (*Zhǎngzhě*):** Analyzed in three aspects: Name-Action, Rank-Title, and Virtue-Karma.<br>
    *   **Name & Action:** "Name" implies Guest; "Action" implies Host. Limits (Frontiers) are the "Country" (Furthest); Governing Center is the "City" (Middle); Gathering places are "Villages" (Nearest). The Elder's name and action pervade all three. He is a "Truthful Great Man" whose inner deeds match the Tathāgata's Three Karmas.<br>
        *   **Current Interpretation:** "Country" = Reward Land (*Real Reward*); "City" = Convenience Land (*With Remainder*); "Village" = Together-Dwelling Land (*Tóngjū*). The Buddha's influence pervades all Three Lands.<br>
    *   **Rank-Title:** Worldly Elder has 10 Virtues (Noble Lineage, High Rank, Great Wealth, etc.). Out-of-World Elder (Buddha) is born from the True Reality of Three Worlds, fully possessed of Ten Titles, Ten Powers, etc.<br>
    *   **Virtue-Karma:** "Age Decayed/Old" (*Shuāi Mài*) represents the maturity of Wisdom and Severance virtues (Buddha's Disconnection Virtue).
</div>
</div>

### 2. The House and Fire (Lines 158+; CBETA 005:158+)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「財富」譬外德... 「田宅」別譬... 「門」又二：宅門、車門...「堂閣」下，譬上安隱對不安隱...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**2. The House (*Shèzhái*):** "Wealth" parallels External Virtue (Ten Powers). "Field" nourishes life (Samadhi nourishing Prajna). "House" shelters the body (Real Realm sheltering Wisdom).<br>
**"Wide and Large":** Represents the Three Worlds being vast. The Tathāgata manages them as a house.<br>
**3. One Door (*Yī Mén*):**<br>
*   **One:** The Single Principle/Truth.<br>
*   **Door:** The Teaching which leads to the Principle.<br>
*   **Interpretation:** The Teaching Door of the Three Vehicles (*Tripitaka*). But strictly speaking, the House Door is the "Exit" (Expedient teaching); the Cart Door is the "Entrance" (Perfect Teaching). If the exit door is the cart door, then the Three Carts initiated at the start are the same as the Great Cart given at the end.<br>
**4. Five Hundred People:** The Sentient Beings of the Five Paths.<br>
**5. Fire Specifics:**<br>
*   **Hall:** Desire Realm.<br>
*   **Pavilion (*Gé*):** Form and Formless Realms.<br>
*   **Walls:** Four Elements.<br>
*   **Decayed/Fallen:** Old age/decay.<br>
*   **Pillars/Base:** Life force.<br>
*   **Beams/Ridgepole:** Consciousness (*Manas*).<br>
*   **Fire Arising:** The Eight Sufferings pervasively burning the Four Elements and Four Births. "Suddenly" (*Hūrán*) implies originally non-existent, arising from Ignorance.
</div>
</div>

### 6. The Thirty Sons (Lines 158 end; CBETA 005:158)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
六、「長者諸子」下，三十子，譬上知眾生性欲...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**6. The Thirty Sons:** Parable for knowing the natures/desires.<br>
*   **10 Sons:** Bodhisattva nature.<br>
*   **20 Sons:** Two Vehicles (10 Śrāvaka + 10 Pratyekabuddha).<br>
Those with the "Nature to Enter the House of Law" are called Sons. The 500 (without this nature) are just "People."<br>
Alternatively: All 30 have the "Nature of Ten Wisdoms" (inner potential), but lack the "Nature of Real Wisdom" (manifestation).
</div>
</div>

### Seeing the Fire (Lines 172-180; CBETA 005:172–180)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
從「長者見是大火」下，是第二，別譬也... 一、明能見；二、明所見；三、明驚怖...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**The Elder Sees the Fire:**<br>
1.  **Able to See:** Buddha Eye views the Five Turbidities.<br>
2.  **Object Seen:** The Great Fire arising from four sides (Four Inverted Views: Impurity, Suffering, Impermanence, Non-self).<br>
3.  **Great Fear/Alarm:**<br>
    *   **Alarm (*Jīng*):** Compassion (*Maitrī*) noting they have no happiness.<br>
    *   **Fear (*Bù*):** Pity (*Karuṇā*) worrying about their suffering.<br>
**"I although am able to exit safely":** The Buddha, by Wisdom Power, finds the True Teaching and is not endangered by the Five Turbidities. He is "Outside" the burning.<br>
**"Teaching as Door":** If the Teaching is the Door, is the Teaching burned? [Discussion on whether Teaching is conditioned/unconditioned].<br>
**"Enjoying Play/Games":** Attaching to Views is "Play" (*Xī*); attaching to Love/Desire is "Games" (*Xì*). Or attaching to Four Views is Play; losing merit is Games. <br>
**"Unaware, Unknown, Not Alarmed, Not Afraid":**<br>
*   **Unaware (*Bù Jué*):** Not sensing the fire (suffering).<br>
*   **Unknown (*Bù Zhī*):** Not understanding it is hot (accumulation).<br>
*   **Not Alarmed:** Not fearing injury to body (Path).<br>
*   **Not Afraid:** Not worrying about death (Extinction).<br>
Basically: Lacking Hearing Wisdom = Unaware; Lacking Thinking Wisdom = Unknown.
</div>
</div>

### 3. Discarding the Table and Using Carts (Lines 182-198; CBETA 005:182–198)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
從「是長者作是思惟」下，是第二，捨几用車譬...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Narrator:** This section explains "Discarding the Table [and Chair] / Using Carts Parable" (*Shě Jī Yòng Chē Pì*).<br>
Previously, the Buddha intended to use the Great Teaching (Table/Chair) but found no capacity; now He uses the Small (Carts).<br>
**Two Approaches to Expedients:**<br>
1.  **Exhortation Door (*Quàn Mén*):** Using gentle encouragement (Siddhānta of Acting for Others). Corresponds to "Body and Hand Power."<br>
    *   **"Body":** Spiritual Power (Miracles) to carry/support.<br>
    *   **"Hand":** Wisdom Power to pull/extract.<br>
    *   **"Table and Chair" (*Yī Jiè Jī Àn*):** *Yī Jiè* is a foreign flower-container (or lapel/sash). *Jī Àn* is a table/bench. Metaphor for the Great Teaching's supports. Since beings couldn't use the Great Supports, He discarded them.<br>
2.  **Admonition Door (*Jiè Mén*):** Using warnings of suffering (Siddhānta of Counteracting).<br>
    *   **"Or they will fall and be burned":** Warning of the dangers of the Five Turbidities.<br>
    *   **"Narrow and Small Door":** The Principle is One (Pure), so "Narrow." The Teaching is subtle, so "Small." Beings cannot pass through the Great Logic.<br>
    *   **"ATTACHED TO PLAY (*Liànzhuó Xìchù*):** Attached to the Play of Views and Love.<br>
    *   **"FALLING (*Duòluò*):** Falling into the Three Paths due to slander or ignorance.<br>
**Using the Carts:**<br>
Since the Exhortation (Great) failed, He uses the Admonition (Small). He "Knows the Children's Prior Minds" (knowing they attach to small things) and "Each has their preferences" (Śrāvaka vs Pratyekabuddha).<br>
**"Rare Playthings" (*Wán-hào Xī Yǒu*):** The Three Vehicles are praised as rare to entice them.
</div>
</div>

### 4. Sons Hearing and Escaping (Lines 198-200; CBETA 005:198–200)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
從「爾時諸子聞父所說」下，第四，適子所願譬...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**"At that time the sons heard the father...":** This is the **Matching the Sons' Wishes Parable**.<br>
Explanation via the **Six Lines** corresponding to the **Stages of Trainee**:<br>
1.  **"Suited their Wishes" (*Shì Yuàn*):** Correspond to **Hearing Wisdom** (*Wén Huì*). Capacity matches Teaching.<br>
2.  **"Brave and Sharp" (*Yǒng Ruì*):** Correspond to **Thinking Wisdom** (*Sī Huì*) / Expedient Path. Mind moves firmly.<br>
3.  **"Pushing and Shoving" (*Hù Xiāng Tuī Pái*):** Pushing against delusions. Correspond to **Warmth and Summit** stages (*Nuan/Ding*).<br>
4.  **"Racing" (*Jìng*):** Competing to grasp the Superior Principle. Correspond to **Patience** stage (*Rěn*).<br>
5.  **"Together" (*Gòng*):** Correspond to **World's First Dharma** (*Laukikāgra*). Together viewing the One Truth.<br>
6.  **"Scrambling/Running Out" (*Chízóu*):** Running out of the Burning House. Correspond to **Path of Vision** (*Darśana-mārga*) and **Path of Cultivation** (*Bhāvanā-mārga*). Cutting off delusions and exiting the Three Worlds.<br>
**Contemplation Interpretation:** The "Middle Way Correct Views" directly view Real Aspect. The Mind and Dharma matching is "Suited Wishes." The Boundless Object makes the view "Brave." Pushing against the duality of Empty/Provisional is "Pushing."
</div>
</div>

### 5. Giving the Great Carts (Lines 200+; CBETA 005:200+)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「是時長者見諸子等」下，是別譬中第三等賜諸子大車譬...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**"At that time the Elder saw the sons...":** This is the **Equally Bestowing Great Carts Parable**.<br>
**Four parts:**<br>
1.  **Father Rejoicing at Escape:** The Buddha rejoices that beings have escaped the sufferings of the Three Worlds.<br>
2.  **Sons Asking for Carts:** Beings (or Disciples) asking for the promised Nirvana (Reward).<br>
3.  **Equally Bestowing:** Giving the One Buddha Vehicle to all, not the Three Vehicles originally promised.<br>
4.  **Sons Rejoicing:** Obtaining the Great Vehicle.<br>
**"Sitting in the Open Space" (*Lù Dì Pì*):**<br>
*   **Old Interpretation:** "Four Crossroads" (*Sì Qú Dào*) = Four Truths. "Open Space" = Extinction of Sufferings.<br>
*   **Current Interpretation:** "Open Ground" (*Lù Dì*) means the exhaustion of delusions of the Three Worlds. Having exited the House (Three Worlds), they sit on the ground of Emptiness. "Sitting" implies not advancing further (into the Provisional/Middle), hence "Sitting in Open Space" represents the Arhat's Nirvana (Peace/Safety).
</div>
</div>

### 6. No Falsehood (Lines 221-253; CBETA 005:221–253)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「舍利弗於汝意云何」下，[1]第四，長者無虛妄譬...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**"Shariputra, what do you think?":** This is the fourth part, the **Elder Has No Falsehood Parable** (*Zhǎngzhě Wú Xūwàng Pì*).<br>
**Metaphor:** "Equal Gift of Great Carts" (Giving the One Vehicle).<br>
**Question:** The Father promised Three but gave One. Is this a lie?<br>
**Answer:** No. "Not empty/false" (*Bù Xū*).<br>
1.  **Sutra Explanation:** The Buddha asks Shariputra: "Is this Elder guilty of the falsehood of vain speech?" Shariputra answers: "No, World Honored One." reason: "He caused the sons to attain peace and save their lives."<br>
2.  **Saving Life is not Falsehood:** Even if he gave no carts at all, saving their lives from fire is already a great benefit. How much more so when he gives a better cart!<br>
3.  **The "Lying" Objection:**<br>
    *   **Objection:** He promised Goat/Deer carts but didn't give them. He gave an Ox cart which wasn't promised. The promise and gift don't match -> Falsehood.<br>
    *   **Resolution:**<br>
        *   **Specific:** The "Body" of the vehicle (Wisdom) acts as the Goat/Deer cart "Function." The Great Cart *contains* the functions of the Three. Thus he gave *what serves as* the Three, plus more. Not a lie.<br>
        *   **General:** The Father's intent was always to save the sons. The "Means" (promise) achieved the "End" (safety). Expedients are not lies when they lead to Truth.<br>
**Verse (Lines 240+):**<br>
"The Elder has no Falsehood" (*Zhǎngzhě Wú Xū-wàng*).<br>
"He possesses Seven Treasures/Carts."<br>
The Verse reiterates that the Buddha, possessing immeasurable wealth (Dharma), gives the same Great Vehicle to all beings, leading them to the same Buddha-Ground.
