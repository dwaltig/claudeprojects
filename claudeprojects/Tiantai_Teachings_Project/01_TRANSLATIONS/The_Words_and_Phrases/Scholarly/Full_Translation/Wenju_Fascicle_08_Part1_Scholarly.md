## Explanation of the Prophecy for Five Hundred Disciples Chapter

**(Text Lines 1-47)**

### 1. Title Explanation

**"Prophecy for Five Hundred Disciples" (*Wǔ Bǎi Dì Zǐ Shòu Jì Pǐn*):**
Why mention "Five Hundred" when the chapter actually prophesies for 1,200 disciples?
*   **Same Name:** All 500 receive the *same* prophesied name (Universal Light).
*   **Expression:** The 500 voiced their understanding, so the chapter is marked by them.
*   This chapter represents the second segment of the "Causes and Conditions" (Parable) preaching cycle.

### 2. Analysis of Prophecy Recipients

Those receiving prophecies are divided into two groups:
1.  **The 1,200** (Arhats).
2.  **The 2,000** (Learners and Non-Learners).

The **1,200** are further divided:
1.  **Purna (Maitrayani-putra):** Bestowed prediction individually.
2.  **The (Remaining) 1,200:** Bestowed prediction collectively.

**Purna's Section:**
1.  **Silent Understanding:** Narrative of his joy and silent comprehension.
2.  **Tathagata's Statement:** The Buddha validates his understanding and gives the prophecy.

**Purna's Joy:**
1.  **Reason for Understanding:**
    *   Heard the *Dharma* and *Parables* (First two cycles: "Opening Three Refined One").
    *   Saw the **Five Great Disciples** (Sariputra, etc.) receive prophecies.
    *   Heard of past "Bonding Causes" (Karma).
    *   Heard of the Buddhas' "Unobstructed Three Wisdoms" (Past/Present/Future), viewing the distant past as if today. This is the power of **Great Sovereign Supernatural Penetration**, explicitly contrasting with the Two Vehicles' limit of 80,000 kalpas.

*   *"Hearing this wisdom from the Buddha"* = Understanding the **Revealing of Reality** in the *Expedient Means* and *Burning House* chapters.
*   *"Expedient means preached according to capacity"* = Understanding the **Opening of the Provisional** in both places.
*   *"Great Disciples... Bodhi Prophecies"* = Understanding "Revealing Reality."
*   *"Past Causes"* = Understanding "Revealing Reality."
*   *"Supernatural Power"* = Understanding "Opening the Provisional."

**"Unprecedented" (*Wèi Céng Yǒu*):**
*   **Internal Joy:** Because he had never heard "Opening Provisional / Revealing Real" before.
*   **"Mind Purified":** Cutting off the craving for (Hinayana) Nirvana and breaking distinct delusions.
*   **"Leaping for Joy":** Because the Buddha's Wisdom-Vision (*Fó Zhī Jiàn*) has been opened.
*   **External Respect:** Bowing because the understanding came from the Buddha.
    *   *From Origin/Trace perspective:* He is rejoicing in the **Real Practice** (of the Bodhisattva path).

**(Line 300)**
**"Thinking this thought..." (Silent Understanding):**
*   **Question:** In the previous two cycles (Dharma/Parable), the disciples spoke aloud. Why is Purna silent?
    *   **Reason 1:** Previously, lower-capacity listeners hadn't understood, so words were needed to move/encourage them. Now that even lower-capacity (Arhats) have understood, no further encouragement is needed.
    *   **Reason 2:** Previously, they understood but didn't seek the "Revealing of the Trace" (Local Origin). Now Purna understands *and* seeks the Trace revelation. Because he understands, he thinks; because he avoids public criticism (of boasting), he is silent. Silent thought is appropriate.
    *   **Reason 3:** Silent understanding is **Great Understanding**, like Vimalakirti's silence being the true entry into the Non-Dual Dharma Gate.
    *   **Reason 4:** The Provisional and Real are inconceivable—beyond words and thought. Yet via words and thought, the previous disciples spoke. Now, grasping "Beyond words/thoughts," he uses silent thought.
    *   **Reason 5:** Why didn't they seek "Trace Revelation" before? Because the lower-capacity root hadn't matured. Now that the lower root (Arhats) understands, the "Provisional Teaching" matter is concluded. If the lower root seeks the Trace, we know the Middle/Upper roots were also provisional (expedients).

**Interpretive Mapping (Silent Thoughts):**
*   *"World Honored One is marvelous/rare"* = Understanding **Real Wisdom** (*Shí Zhì*).
*   *"Accord with worldly species... to preach"* = Understanding **Provisional Wisdom** (*Quán Zhì*). This is the root nature of the Seven Expedients. (Matches *Expedient Means* chapter).
*   *"Pulling sentient beings out of attachment"* = Matches *Burning House* chapter (Opening Provisional / Revealing Real).
*   *"We cannot express the Buddha's merit"* = Matches *Medicinal Herbs* (Buddha has limitless merit/wisdom). "Cannot express" implies thoughts also cannot reach it.
*   *"Only the Buddha knows"* = Silent request for "Revealing the Trace" (*Fā Jī*).
    *   *"We"* = Universal request for everyone's Trace to be revealed.
    *   *"Deep Mind"* = Looking at the Origin and Present.
    *   *"Original Vow"* = Great Compassionate Vow (Downward Transforming).
    *   *Requesting "Ascending Seeking" (Buddhahood)* = Seeking Prophecy.
    *   *Requesting "Downward Transforming"* = Seeking Trace Revelation.

### 3. The Buddha's Validation and Prophecy

**(Line 302)**
**"The Buddha said..." (Description):**
The Buddha narrates and prophesies. There are Prose and Verse sections.
The Prose has two parts:
1.  **Granting Predictions to the 1,200** (implied).
2.  **Specifically Granting to Ajnata-Kaundinya** (the first Arhat).
3.  **Specifically Granting to the 500** (Same Name).

**Narrating Origin/Traces (Purna):**
1.  **Revealing Trace via Shakyamuni's Age:**
    *   *"Do you see this person?"* = Do you see his Trace (Small Vehicle) or his Origin (Bodhisattva Merit)? People only see the Sravaka Trace.
    *   *"I always praise him [as first in preaching]":* If he weren't from the Marvelous Origin of the Dharma Body, he couldn't manifest the "First" trace. In the past, I praised his Trace; now I praise him as "First" in the Unsurpassed Dharma. This **Raises the Trace to Reveal the Origin**.
2.  **Revealing Origin Merit:**
    *   *"Also always praise his [various merits]":* He has "Ten Thousand Practices" of Blessings and Wisdom.
    *   Since the Origin (Local) has various Dharma Gates, the Trace cannot just be a Two Vehicle. This **Raises the Origin to Clarify the Trace**.
3.  **Specific Explanation:**
    *   *"Diligently Protects and Upholds":* Helping proclaim the **Half and Full Teachings** in the Traces.
    *   *Five Flavors Mapping:*
        *   Trace as Sravaka = Helping proclaim **Dairy** (Agamas).
        *   Trace in Vaipulya (Scolded) = Helping proclaim **Cream** (*Shēng Sū*).
        *   Trace leading Prajna = Helping proclaim **Butter** (*Shú Sū*) (Subhuti).
        *   Trace in Lotus = Helping proclaim **Ghee** (*Tí Hú*).
    *   *"Self-discarding the Tathagata":* Aside from the King of Doctors (Buddha), no one knows his depth. He "discards himself" (descends) from the level of Subtle Enlightenment.

**(Line 306)**
**Revealing Past Origins:**
*"Do not say [he only] helps proclaim My Dharma..."*
*   He also helped in the **Far Distant Past**.
*   **Trace vs. Origin:** Today's helping = **Revealing Trace** (*Fā Jī*). Past helping = **Revealing Origin** (*Xiǎn Běn*).
*   **Two Origins:**
    1.  **Far Origin (*Yuǎn Běn*):** Mysterious and distant, omitted.
    2.  **Near Origin (*Jìn Běn*):** **90 Billion Buddhas**. Cited because those with Past-Life Knowledge can verify it.
*   *Five Flavors in the Past:* Even then, he helped proclaim the Dairy, Cream, Butter, and Ghee teachings.
    *   *"Empty Dharmas clearly understood"* = Helping proclaim **Prajna** (Butter).
    *   *"Transforming limitless beings"* = Helping proclaim **Lotus** (Ghee).

**(Line 310)**
**Three Periods (Fulfilling Practice):**
*"Also under the Seven Buddhas..."*
Refers to the **Three Periods** (Past 90 Billion, Recent Past 7 Buddhas, Present). Throughout all, he helped proclaim the Half/Full and Five Flavor Dharmas.

**(Text Line 26 in Source T1718_008)**
**2. Prophecy for the 1,200:**
1.  **Request (implied/silent).**
2.  **Prophecy.**
3.  **Silent Understanding/Rejoicing.**

**Question:** Only 500 receive the prophecy here. Where are the 1,200?
**Answer:** The 500 *are* part of the 1,200. The verses later mention "700 remaining," completing the count. Also, the "Holding" chapter says "I have already predicted all Sravakas."

**Explanation of Verses:**
*   **Parable of the Hidden Jewel (Line 40):**
    *   *"Like a man [drunk]":* The Two Vehicle person.
    *   *"Close Friend":* The 16th Prince (Past affinity).
    *   *"House":* The Great Vehicle Teaching.
    *   *"Drunk and Asleep":* The Great Capacity triggered (temporarily) but covered by Ignorance. "Drunk" means either totally unaware (Heavy) or dimly aware and forgetting (Light).
    *   *"Official Business":* The Prince's duty to transform others elsewhere (not personal business).
    *   *"Priceless Jewel":* The **One Vehicle Real Mark True Suchness Wisdom Jewel**.
    *   *"Sewn in Robe":*
        *   *Outer Robe:* Shame and Patience (Protects from evil).
        *   *Inner Robe:* Faith and Joy (inner roots).
    *   *"Drunk/Unaware":* Forgetting the Great Vehicle seed.
    *   *"Rising and Wandering to Other Lands":* Leaving the "Great Vehicle Country" to wander in "Samsara" (Demon Country) or "Small Vehicle" (Other Country). Seeking "Small Vehicle Clothing/Food" (Nirvana/Samadhi) instead of the Jewel.
    *   *"Satisfied with Little":* Content with Arhatship.

*   **Friend Awakening Him (Line 44):**
    *   Matches the "Today" teaching (Lotus Sutra).
    *   **Scolding:** "Why do you do this?" (Why satisfied with small?).
    *   **Showing the Jewel:** Revealing the Past Cause.
    *   **Advising Trade:** Encouraging them to take the Great Vehicle.

**(Line 48)**
## Explanation of the Prophecy for Learners and Adepts Chapter

*"Studying Truth and cutting off Delusion is 'Learning' (*Xué*). Truth exhausted and Delusion ended is 'No-Learning' (*Wú Xué*)."*

*   **Three Storehouse (Tripitaka) Meaning:** Analytic study of Truth = Learning.
*   **Common (Shared) Meaning:** Embodying Truth/Emptiness = Learning.
*   **Separate (Distinct) Meaning:** Shallow to Deep = Learning. Cutting off Ignorance completely = No-Learning.
*   **Round (Perfect) Meaning:** Studying the **Tathagata-Garbha**. Dharma Nature Real Mark is neither Learning nor No-Learning, yet is both.

**The 2,000 People:**
Some are Learners, some Adepts. They are of one "Teacher" (flow), receive prophecy at one time, and share one name.

**Two Groups Requesting:**
1.  **Specific Two (Ananda and Rahula):**
    *   **Rahula:** Buddha's son (Close in Worldly ties).
    *   **Ananda:** Holder of Dharma Treasury (Close in Dharma ties).
    *   *Why last?* If these two "Closest" ones don't get a specific prophecy, the crowd's hope isn't satisfied.
2.  **The 2,000 (General):**
    *   They only "Think" (Silent request) and "Look" (Expectation).

**Question:** If they are "Close" and "Important," why are they last?
**Answer:** They were *implicitly* included in the General Prophecy (1,200). Now they seek a *Specific* prophecy. Also, Ananda is a "Learner" only, so he is grouped here.

**Ananda's Prophecy:**
*   Eight Thousand Bodhisattvas doubt: *"Why do these Sravakas get a prophecy before us?"*
*   **Buddha Resolves Doubt:** Revelation of Origin (*Fā Jī*).
    *   I (Shakyamuni) and Ananda developed the Mind for Bodhi *at the same time* under Empty King Buddha.
    *   Ananda loved **Learning (Multi-Hearing)**.
    *   I loved **Energy (Diligence)**.
    *   Therefore, I became Buddha quickly. He protects my Dharma Treasury (as a Sravaka). This is his Vow/Function, not a lower state.

## Explanation of the Dharma Teacher Chapter

**(Text Lines 69-120)**

### 1. The Five Kinds of Dharma Teachers

**"Prophecy for Dharma Teachers" (*Fǎ Shī Pǐn*):**
*   **Five Kinds:**
    1.  **Receive and Hold (*Shòu Chí*):** Faith Power (Mind).
    2.  **Read (*Dú*):** Looking at the text (Mouth).
    3.  **Recite (*Sòng*):** Not forgetting/reciting from memory (Mouth).
    4.  **Explain (*Jiě Shuō*):** Propagating to others (Mouth).
    5.  **Copy/Write (*Shū Xiě*):** Body Karma.

*   *Comparison:* The *Great Treatise* lists six. Here, "Receive/Hold" are combined, and "Explain/Preach" are combined. "Read/Recite" are split into two, and "Copying" is added to make five.
*   **Self-Practice vs. Transforming Others:**
    *   First 4 (Hold, Read, Recite) = Self-Practice (mostly).
    *   Explain/Copy = Transforming Others.
    *   The *Nirvana Sutra* divides these into 9 grades.
*   **Generic Meaning:**
    *   Standardizing oneself with the Five Dharmas = **Self-Practice Dharma Teacher**.
    *   Teaching others the Five Dharmas = **Transforming-Others Dharma Teacher**.
    *   Therefore, both Disciples (Self) and Teachers (Others) are called "Dharma Teachers."

**Why "Dharma Teacher"?**
1.  **Teacher of the Dharma:** The person takes the Dharma as their Teacher (Self-Practice).
2.  **Teacher of Dharma:** The person uses the Dharma to teach others (Transforming Others).

### 2. The Three Ornaments (Robe, Seat, Room)

The text explains three methods (Ornaments) for protecting the Teacher:
1.  **Room (*Shì*):** **Great Compassion (*Cí Bēi*):**
    *   Entering the Room = Entering the Buddha's Compassion.
    *   Function: Sheltering self and others from evil/ugliness.
2.  **Robe (*Yī*):** **Gentle Patience (*Róu Hé Rěn Rǔ*):**
    *   Wearing the Robe = Enduring difficulty.
    *   Function: Hiding ugliness (defilements) and protecting against external harm.
3.  **Seat (*Zuò*):** **Emptiness of All Dharmas (*Yí Qiè Fǎ Kōng*):**
    *   Sitting on the Seat = Resting in Emptiness.
    *   Function: Annulling anxiety. Peaceful dwelling.

**Why Three?**
*   **Compassion (Room):** Saves from the **Delusion of Suffering** (Birth/Death).
*   **Patience (Robe):** Saves from the **Delusion of Karma** (Conflict/Harm).
*   **Emptiness (Seat):** Saves from the **Delusion of Views/Knowledge** (Attachment).
*   Also corresponds to the **Three Void Gates** (Emptiness, Signlessness, Wishlessness).

### 3. Five Grades of Propagation (Trace Door)

This chapter begins a sequence of **Five Chapters on Propagation** (Trace Door Circulation):
1.  **Dharma Teacher (Ch. 10):** Explains the merit of holding the Sutra.
2.  **Jeweled Stupa (Ch. 11):** Great verification/proof.
3.  **Devadatta (Ch. 12):** Past propagation (proving deep merit).
4.  **Fortitude (Ch. 13):** 80,000 Bodhisattvas vow to propagate in the visible world.
5.  **Peaceful Practices (Ch. 14):** Method for comfortable propagation in the evil world.

### 4. Analysis of the Text (Prophecy for Teachers)

**A. Buddha's Lifetime (Prophecy for Present Disciples):**
*   **Medicine King (*Yào Wáng*):** Addressed as the representative.
*   **The 80,000 Great Men:** The recipients.
*   **Prophecy:** "If one hears one verse/sentence... and has one moment of rejoicing... I predict they will attain Bodhi."
    *   *Why?* Even a small seed of the Lotus (One Verse) leads to the Ultimate Fruit.

**B. After Extinction (Prophecy for Future Disciples):**
*   **Lower Grade Teacher:** Secretly teaches one person one phrase.
    *   **"Envoy of the Tathagata" (*Rú Lái Shǐ*):** Because they carry the Buddha's message.
    *   **"Doing the Tathagata's Work" (*Xíng Rú Lái Shì*):** The work of saving beings.
*   **Upper Grade Teacher:** Teaches in the Great Assembly.
    *   Merit is even greater.

**C. Comparison of Merit (Offense and Blessing):**
*   **Offending the Teacher:**
    *   "If someone scolds a Buddha for a kalpa... sin is light."
    *   "If someone scolds a Layperson/Monk reading the Lotus Sutra for a moment... sin is heavy."
    *   *Analogy:* The Buddha is like a Great King (Unmovable, Transcendent). The Teacher (Beginner) is like the King's young Prince traveling in a dangerous land. He is vulnerable and represents the King's lineage. Therefore, harming him is a graver attack on the functional lineage.
    *   Also, the Beginner has potential defilements (needs protection), so attacks obstruct their Way. The Buddha is beyond obstruction.

**D. Praise of the Sutra:**
*   *"Of all Sutras I have preached, am preaching, or will preach, this is the most difficult to believe and understand."*
    *   **Preached (Past):** Prajna/Vaipulya.
    *   **Am Preaching (Present):** Immeasurable Meanings Sutra.
    *   **Will Preach (Future):** Nirvana Sutra.
    *   *Meaning:* The Lotus is the **First** among all these. It is the "Secret Storehouse."
    *   *"Secret"* (*Mì*): Hidden/Not spoken before.
    *   *"Essential"* (*Yào*): Gathering everything into the One Way.

### 5. Method of Propagation (Rule for Others)

**Three Rules (Ornaments) Detailed:**
1.  **Room (Compassion):** "Great Compassion is the Room."
    *   *Function:* To cover/shelter living beings.
2.  **Robe (Patience):** "Gentle Patience is the Robe."
    *   *Function:* To protect against the "poisonous insects" (abuse/scolding) of the evil age.
3.  **Seat (Emptiness):** "Emptiness of All Dharmas is the Seat."
    *   *Function:* To dwell peacefully without attachment.

*   *Shouldering the Tathagata:* Using the **Two Modes of Wisdom** (Provisional/Real). To "Shoulder" (*Dān*) is on the shoulder (Active/Wisdom). To "Carry" (*Hè*) is on the back (Passive/Body).

### 6. Parable of Digging for Water (Nearness to Enlightenment)

**(Text Lines 125-151)**

**"Just as someone digging for water in a high plateau..."**
*   **High Plateau (*Gāo Yuán*):** Analogy for the deluded mind of sentient beings (or the theoretical teachings).
*   **Dry Soil (*Gān Tǔ*):** Analogy for the **Three Storehouse (Tripitaka) Teaching**. Investigating Emptiness analytically (Dry). Far from the Water of Buddha Nature.
*   **Wet Soil (*Shī Tǔ*):** Analogy for the **Vaipulya and Prajna Teachings**. Containing the flavor of the Middle, mixed with provisionality. Approaching the water.
*   **Mud (*Ní*):** Analogy for the **Lotus Sutra**. The simultaneous presence of Emptiness and Existence (Earth and Water mixed). The Middle Way is clearly seen.
*   **Water (*Shuǐ*):** The **Buddha Fruit (Bodhi/Nirvana)**.

**Critique of Interpretations:**
*   Some masters say *Prajna* is Dry Soil, *Lotus* is Wet Soil, *Nirvana* is Water.
*   **Tiantai's Verdict:** All previous sutras (Tripitaka, Vaipulya, Prajna) are considered "Distant" (Dry/Wet) because the **Expedient Door was not yet opened**. The practitioners were stuck in the "Provisional," not realizing it was just a means.
*   The *Lotus Sutra* is "Near" (Mud/Water) because it **decides the Sravaka Law**, revealing it as the One Vehicle. "Deciding" (*Jué Liǎo*) removes the doubt/distance.

### 7. Opening the Door of Expedients

**(Text Lines 151-169)**

**"Opening the Expedient Door, Showing the Real Mark" (*Kāi Fāng Biàn Mén, Shì Zhēn Shí Xiàng*):**
*   **Guangzhai's View:** "In the Deer Park, the One Truth was hidden by the Three. Now in the Lotus, the Truth is revealed, so the old Three are abolished. Abolishing is 'Opening'."
    *   *Tiantai Critique:* This is **breaking** the expedient, not opening it. If you destroy the clay to get the gold, that is destruction.
*   **River West (Dao Lang)'s View:** "Directly labeling the Three as Expedient *is* opening the door. Before, we didn't say they were expedients (closed). Now we say they are expedients (open) for the Real."
    *   *Tiantai:* This implies a duality.
*   **Tiantai's View:**
    *   The Three *are* the One.
    *   Opening means revealing that the Provisional *is* the Real.
    *   **Door Logic:**
        *   Is the Expedient a Door to the Real? Yes.
        *   Is the Real a Door to the Expedient? Yes (From Real arises Provisional).
        *   Is "Three" a door? No, "Three" is the closed state. Revealing "Three is One" opens the door.

### 8. The Five Benefits of Propagation

**(Text Lines 173-180)**

The Buddha promises five kinds of supernatural assistance to the Teacher in the evil age:
1.  **Sending Transformation People (*Qiǎn Huà Rén*):** To sit in the audience and listen.
2.  **Sending Transformation Monks/Nuns/Laypeople (*Huà Sì Zhòng*):** To support the teacher.
3.  **Sending Eight Departments (*Bā Bù*):** Gods/Dragons to protect.
4.  **Seeing the Buddha Body (*Jiàn Fó Shēn*):** If the mind is unattached (no arrogance), one sees the Buddha.
5.  **Giving Dharani (*Yǔ Zǒng Chí*):** Memory retention.

*   *Note:* If the beginner's mind is not pure, they only see transformation people. If pure, they see the Buddha and receive Dharani.

**Verses (18.5 Lines):**
*   Summarizing the "Method" (Ornaments) and "Benefits" (Sending people/Seeing Buddha).
