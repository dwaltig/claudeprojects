[1]「漸漸具足菩薩」下，第二，授記。文為七：一、明因圓；二、「過無量」下，明果滿；三、明國土廣淨；四、明國劫名字；五、明佛壽量；六、明法住大久；七、明佛滅後供養舍利。就第三國廣淨中復五：一、明國大嚴淨。「地平如掌」者，經直言如掌不言手掌，手掌不平則非所引，海底有石名掌，此石無有一微塵許不平，當[2]是類如海掌耳。又《賢劫經》正明如佛手掌，非引人掌也。二、明純是善道。三、明人天福慧具足，《月藏》第九法食、喜食、禪食，經文總言法喜禪悅，[3]別分應有三種差別。四、明菩薩聲聞眾數甚多。五、總結[4]也。《月藏》第五云「不殺得十功德，一於一切眾生得無所畏，乃至第十命終生善道後作佛，國無害仗之具國人長壽；不盜十功德，一果報具足而大，為事決斷無有難礙，乃至第十死生善道，後作佛國華寶莊嚴充滿；不[5]淫十功德，一諸根律儀為事決斷，乃至死生善道，後作佛國無女人；不妄語十功德，一眾生信其言，乃至死生善道，後作佛時國無臭穢常滿寶華；不兩舌十功德，一身不可壞，乃至死生善道，後作佛國魔不能壞眷屬；不惡口得十功德，一柔軟語乃至死生善道，作佛國法聲充滿；不綺語十功德，一天人愛敬，乃至死生善道，作佛國眾生強記不忘；不貪十功德，一身根不缺，乃至死生善道，作佛國無魔外道；不瞋十功德，一離一切瞋，乃至死生善道，作佛國人得三昧；不邪見十功德，一心性柔善，乃至死生善道作佛國人正信。」

Below “Gradually complete the bodhisattva” is the second section, the prophecy. The text has seven: (1) clarify the perfection of causes; (2) below “past innumerable,” clarify the fulfillment of results; (3) clarify the vast purity of the land; (4) clarify the land’s kalpa‑name; (5) clarify the Buddha’s lifespan; (6) clarify the long duration of the Dharma; (7) clarify offerings to relics after the Buddha’s extinction. Within the third (vast purity) there are five: (1) clarify the land’s great adornment and purity. “The ground is level like a palm” — the sutra says “like a palm,” not “hand‑palm”; a human palm is uneven, so that is not the referent. In the sea there is a stone called “palm”; it has not a speck of unevenness—this should be like the sea‑palm. The *Sūtra of the Worthy Kalpa* explicitly says it is like the Buddha’s hand‑palm, not a human palm. (2) clarify it is wholly a good path. (3) clarify that humans and gods have complete blessings and wisdom: *Moon‑Storehouse*, fasc. 9, speaks of dharma‑food, joy‑food, and dhyāna‑food; the sutra text generally says dharma‑joy and dhyāna‑delight, but [3] separately there should be three kinds. (4) clarify that the bodhisattva and śrāvaka assemblies are very numerous. (5) general conclusion. *Moon‑Storehouse*, fasc. 5, says: “Not killing gains ten merits: first, among all beings one gains fearlessness; … up to the tenth, at life’s end one is born on a good path and afterward becomes Buddha; in that land there are no harmful weapons and the people live long. Not stealing gains ten merits: first, the reward is complete and great and one decides affairs without obstruction; … up to the tenth, at death one is born on a good path and later becomes Buddha, and the Buddha‑land is filled with jeweled adornments. Not engaging in sexual misconduct gains ten merits: first, the faculties are disciplined and decisive; … up to death one is born on a good path and later becomes Buddha, and the land has no women. Not lying gains ten merits: first, beings trust one’s words; … up to death one is born on a good path and later becomes Buddha, and the land has no foulness and is always filled with jeweled flowers. Not double‑tongue gains ten merits: first, the body is unbreakable; … up to death one is born on a good path and later becomes Buddha, and in that land māras cannot destroy the retinue. Not harsh speech gains ten merits: first, gentle words; … up to death one is born on a good path, and when one becomes Buddha the land is filled with the sound of the Dharma. Not frivolous speech gains ten merits: first, gods and humans love and respect; … up to death one is born on a good path, and as Buddha the land’s beings are strong in memory and do not forget. Not greed gains ten merits: first, the sense‑faculties are not deficient; … up to death one is born on a good path, and as Buddha the land has no māras or outsiders. Not anger gains ten merits: first, one departs all anger; … up to death one is born on a good path, and as Buddha the land’s people obtain samādhi. Not wrong view gains ten merits: first, the mind‑nature is gentle and good; … up to death one is born on a good path, and as Buddha the land’s people have right faith.”

偈有二十一行半，頌上發迹授記。初，有十四行，頌發迹；次，七行半，頌授記。初復二：前七行，總發諸聲聞迹，頌上我等之意也；後七行，頌上發滿願迹。總中有五：初一行，總標佛子為行難思，已得垂迹之法。次「知眾樂小法」下，第二，一行，明垂迹之由。次「以無數方便」下，第三，二行，明垂迹利益。次「內祕」下，第四，二行，明內懷大道外現小失。次「若我具足」下，第五，一行，指略抑廣。「小欲」者，示求小乘也；「懈怠」，示退大乘也。非但示為聲聞，亦作外道及三毒凡夫也。身子示瞋、難陀示貪、調達示癡(云云)。

The verses have twenty‑one and a half lines, praising the above revelation‑of‑traces predictions. First, fourteen lines praise the revelation of traces; next, seven and a half lines praise the predictions. The first again has two: the first seven lines generally praise the traces of the śrāvakas, echoing our intention above; the latter seven lines praise the traces of fulfilling vows. The general part has five: first one line generally marks the Buddha‑sons as difficult‑to‑think practices, already obtaining the dharma of manifesting traces. Next, below “Knowing beings delight in small dharmas,” second: one line clarifying the cause of manifesting traces. Next, below “By innumerable expedients,” third: two lines clarifying the benefit of manifesting traces. Next, below “Secret within,” fourth: two lines clarifying that inwardly they hold the great path and outwardly display small defects. Next, below “If I were complete,” fifth: one line pointing briefly to omitting the broad. “Small desire” indicates seeking the Small Vehicle; “laziness” indicates retreating from the Great Vehicle. Not only do they manifest as śrāvakas, they also act as outsiders and as ordinary beings of the three poisons: Śāriputra manifests anger, Nanda manifests greed, Devadatta manifests delusion (etc.).

「今此富」下，第二，七行，頌發滿願迹本。上文有三，今略頌二。初，五行，頌顯過去本；後「未來亦供養」下，第二，二行，頌三世中佛所行因；略不頌七佛及現佛也。「供養諸如來」下，七行半，頌授記。上文有七，今頌其四：初半行，頌因圓。次半行，頌果滿。「其國名淨」下三句，超頌國劫名號。「菩薩眾甚多」下五行三句，頌國土廣淨。略不頌壽命、法住、滅後起塔也。

Below “Now this wealth,” second: seven lines praising the trace‑root of fulfilling vows. Above there were three; now two are briefly praised. First, five lines praise revealing the past root; then below “Future also will make offerings,” second: two lines praise the causes practiced by Buddhas across the three times; it omits praising the seven Buddhas and the present Buddha. Below “Making offerings to the Tathāgatas,” seven and a half lines praise the prediction. Above there were seven; now four are praised: first half‑line praises perfect causes; second half‑line praises fulfilled results. The three phrases below “Its land is named Pure” leap‑praise the names of land and kalpa. The five lines and three phrases below “The bodhisattva assembly is very many” praise the vast purity of the land. It omits praising lifespan, Dharma‑duration, and post‑extinction stūpa‑building.

第二，授千二百記：一、念請，二、與記，三、領解。請、記如文。授記文有長行、偈頌。長行有三：一、總許千二百記；二、別授陳如，陳如最初悟道，居首上座故別授記；三、別授記五百，五百名同須別與記。

Second, bestowing the twelve hundred predictions: (1) silent request, (2) giving the prediction, (3) receiving and understanding. The request and prediction are as in the text. The prediction passage has prose and verse. The prose has three: (1) generally grants the twelve hundred predictions; (2) separately predicts Kauṇḍinya, who first awakened the Way and is first among the elders; (3) separately predicts the five hundred, who share one name and thus must be given separately.

問：

Question:

---
但見五百得記，不見千二百。

We only see five hundred receive prediction; we do not see twelve hundred.

---
答：

Answer:

---
此五百即千二百數，頌中末後一行半總授七百，故是千二百也。又〈持品〉云「我先總[6]記一切聲聞皆已授記」，即指今一行半，非是止授七百聲聞也。

These five hundred are the number of the twelve hundred. In the verses, the final one and a half lines generally predict the seven hundred, thus making twelve hundred. Moreover, the *Upholding* chapter says, “I previously generally predicted all śrāvakas,” referring precisely to this one‑and‑a‑half line; it is not that only seven hundred śrāvakas were predicted.

偈頌有十一行，為二：初九行半，頌記陳如及與五百；後一行半，總授一切聲聞記。五百領解，文有長行、偈頌。長行先經家敘其歡喜，次自陳領解。經家先慶今得解歡喜，次愧昔不解故自責。慶中先明內心慶喜，後明外形恭敬也。悔過自責者，即是明其愧昔不解也。「世尊我等」下，第二，自陳領解，有二：一、法說，二、譬說。法說中初悔得少為足，次責根鈍難悟。從「世尊」乃至「滅度」，是悔責昔迷得小為足不知求大；從「今乃知之」，是責根鈍始悟不早知之，今知小非究竟、大為真實也。譬中二：初、略，次、正舉譬。「如無智者」，略舉譬況。「所以者何」下，釋無智意也。譬說有二：一者醉酒譬，譬法說自悔得少為足不知求大，領前法譬宿世中施權意；二者親友覺悟譬，譬法說自責根鈍難悟，今乃知之，領前法譬宿世中顯實。就初復三意：一者繫珠譬，領上王子結緣；二者醉臥不覺譬，領上遇其退大；三者起已遊行譬，領上接之以小。「譬如有人」者，即二乘人也。「親友」者，昔日第十六王子也。「家」即大乘教為家也。「醉酒而臥」者，當于爾時大機暫發無明暫伏，[7]以得聞經內心微解，以無明重故還復迷失。醉有二義：一、重醉，都不覺知；二、輕醉，微覺尋忘亦名不覺。雖有二義，終成繫珠如毒鼓耳。「官事當行」者，明王子餘處機興逗緣往應，故云「當行」。弘法化他此非私務，故云「官事」。「無價寶珠」者，一乘實相真如[1]智寶也。「繫其衣裏」者，慚愧忍辱能遮瞋恚及防外惡，即是外衣；信樂之心內裏善根，即是內衣。于時聞法微信樂欲，即了因智願種子也。第二，「醉臥不覺知」者，無明心重尋復不憶，此領中間懈退不受大法也。第三，「起已遊行他國」者，領上中間接之以小，受三乘化也，善根欲發厭苦求樂，故云「起已遊行」。無明覆解不知向本求大乘衣食，故言向他國求於小乘衣食。若魔佛相望，生死魔界為他國，佛法大小皆為本國；就小大相望，小乘未免生死，猶是他國，大乘永免生死，乃為本土。究竟還源也，明背大乘國往小乘土，不知從珠取給，而傭作自資獲一日價，得少為足也。

The verses have eleven lines, in two: the first nine and a half lines praise the prediction for Chenru and the five hundred; the latter one and a half lines generally predict all śrāvakas. The five hundred’s understanding has prose and verse. In the prose, the compiler first narrates their joy, then they state their understanding. The compiler first rejoices in their present understanding and joy, then they themselves reproach their former lack of understanding. In rejoicing, first the inner mind’s joy is clarified, then outer form’s reverent behavior. Their remorse and self‑reproach shows their shame at former non‑understanding. From “World‑Honored One, we…” down to “extinction,” they repent that in the past they were deluded, took the small as sufficient, and did not know to seek the great; from “Now we then know,” they reproach their dull roots, only now awakening, not knowing earlier—now knowing the small is not ultimate and the great is true. The parable has two: first a brief parable, then a full parable. “Like a foolish man” briefly raises the parable; below “Why is this?” explains the foolishness. The parable explanation has two: (1) the drunk‑man parable, which matches the Dharma explanation—repenting being satisfied with the small and not seeking the great, and echoes the earlier Dharma parable about past lives and provisional means; (2) the friend‑awakening parable, which matches reproaching dull roots—“now we know”—and echoes the earlier Dharma parable about revealing the real in past lives. In the first there are three meanings: (1) the jewel‑tying parable, matching the earlier prince’s forming an affinity; (2) the drunken‑sleeping, unaware parable, matching the earlier meeting and retreating from the great; (3) the rising and wandering parable, matching the earlier being led by the small. “Like someone” means the two‑vehicle person; “close friend” means the sixteenth prince of old. “House” is the Great Vehicle teaching. “Drunk and asleep” means at that time the great capacity briefly arose and ignorance briefly subsided; hearing the sutra, the mind slightly understood, but because ignorance was heavy it again lost it. Drunkenness has two meanings: heavy drunkenness, not knowing at all; light drunkenness, dimly aware then forgetting—also called not knowing. Though two meanings, it finally becomes the jewel‑tying as with the poison‑drum. “Official business to go” means the prince, when other conditions arose, went elsewhere to respond, hence “must go”; propagating the Dharma for others is not private business, thus “official.” The “priceless jewel” is the one‑vehicle true‑suchness wisdom‑jewel. “Tied in his robe” means: shame and patience can cover anger and guard against outward evil—this is the outer robe; faith and joy within are inner wholesome roots—this is the inner robe. At that time hearing the Dharma with slight faith and joy is the seed of the conditioning‑cause wisdom and vow. Second, “drunk and unaware” means ignorance is heavy and again does not remember, matching the middle retreat and not receiving the great Dharma. Third, “rising and wandering to another country” matches being led in the middle by the small, receiving the three‑vehicle transformation; as wholesome roots desire to arise, tired of suffering and seeking joy, thus “rising and wandering.” Ignorance covers understanding and does not know to seek the great‑vehicle clothing and food in the home country, thus it seeks the small‑vehicle clothing and food in another country. If we set māra and Buddha against each other, the realm of birth‑and‑death is the other country, and both great and small Dharma are the home country; if set small and great against each other, the small vehicle still has birth‑and‑death and is another country, while the great vehicle forever transcends birth‑and‑death and is the homeland. Returning to the ultimate source means: turning from the great‑vehicle land to the small‑vehicle land, not knowing to draw on the jewel, but working for wages to support oneself, gaining a day’s pay and thinking it sufficient.

「於後會遇」下，第二，親友發覺譬，領上以是本因緣今說《法華》等賜大車也。此為三：先、呵責，二、示珠，三、勸貿。呵責譬上動執生疑，示珠譬宿世因緣，勸貿譬得記作佛，三周皆有此三意。法說中我令脫苦縛，即是呵責；五佛章即是開示；身子得記即是勸貿。譬說中我先不言皆為菩提，即是呵責；三車一車即是示珠；中根得記即是勸貿。下根宿世因緣汝等善聽，即是呵責；覆講結緣還為說大，即是示珠；下根得記即是勸貿。繫珠中三意望三周者，始在佛樹以大擬，即是繫珠；無機息化即是醉臥；尋施方便即是起行。譬喻中二萬億佛所，即是繫珠；遣傍人追悶絕不受，即是醉臥；三車引得即是起行。因緣中大通智勝佛所，即是繫珠；中路懈退即是醉臥；接之以小即是起行。此等皆名領權也。「某年日月」者，指大通佛所也。「佛亦如是」下，第二，合譬。譬本有二，今各有三意：從「教化我等」下，合初一繫珠；「而尋廢忘」，合初二醉不覺知；「既得羅漢」下，合初三起已遊行。「一切智願」下，合後親友覺示譬。上有三，今亦三。從「智願不失」者，是合後一呵責；從「我久令汝」下，合後二示珠；從「我今乃知」下，合後三勸貿所須也。

Below “At a later time he meets,” second: the friend‑awakening parable, matching the earlier statement “by these causes and conditions I now speak the *Lotus*” and granting the great cart. This has three: first, scolding; second, showing the jewel; third, urging trade. Scolding matches the previous “stirred by attachment and produced doubt”; showing the jewel matches former causes and conditions; urging trade matches receiving prediction and becoming Buddha. In the Dharma explanation, “I cause you to escape bondage of suffering” is scolding; the five‑Buddha section is revealing; Śāriputra’s prediction is urging trade. In the parable, “I earlier did not say all are for bodhi” is scolding; the three carts and one cart are showing the jewel; the middle‑roots receiving prediction is urging trade. The lower‑roots’ past causes and conditions, “you should listen well,” is scolding; reviewing and forming affinities, then again speaking the great, is showing the jewel; the lower‑roots’ prediction is urging trade. The three meanings of tying the jewel correspond to the three cycles: at the Buddha‑tree with the great intention is tying the jewel; no capacity and cessation of transformation is drunken sleep; then applying expedients is rising and going. In the parable: at two‑trillion Buddhas is tying the jewel; sending bystanders, their fainting and non‑acceptance is drunken sleep; leading by three carts is rising and going. In the causes‑and‑conditions: at the Great‑Universal‑Wisdom‑Excellence Buddha is tying the jewel; mid‑way slacking is drunken sleep; leading by the small is rising and going. These are all called receiving the provisional. “In such year, month, day” refers to the Great‑Universal Buddha. Below “The Buddha is also like this,” second: the parable‑matching. The parable has two, each with three meanings: from “teaching and transforming us” matches the first tying‑jewel; “and then forgetting” matches the first drunken‑sleep; “having obtained arhatship” matches the first rising‑and‑going. “The all‑wisdom vow” matches the later friend‑awakening‑and‑showing‑jewel. Above there are three; here too: “the wisdom‑vow does not fail” matches the later first scolding; “for long I caused you” matches the later second showing the jewel; “now I then know” matches the later third urging trade and providing what is needed.

第二，偈頌，有十二行半，為二：初一行半，頌內心得解，又二：初一行，頌慶喜，次半行，頌悔責也。次「於無量佛寶」下，第二，有十一行，頌自陳領解。上文有二，今初半行，頌悔責得少為足，略不頌難悟今乃知之。「如無智愚人」半行，頌略舉譬。「便自以為足」，頌釋無智意。次十行，頌譬說開合，初六行頌開，後四行頌合。上開有二，今初四行頌捨寶不知，後二行頌親友覺悟。餘文易見。

Second, the verses, twelve and a half lines, in two: the first one and a half lines praise inner understanding and again two: first one line praises joy; next half‑line praises remorse. Next, below “Among innumerable Buddha‑treasures,” second: eleven lines praise self‑statement of understanding. Above there were two; now the first half‑line praises repenting being satisfied with the small and omits praising “difficult to awaken, now we know.” “Like a foolish and ignorant person,” half‑line, praises the brief parable. “Then he himself takes it as sufficient” praises explaining the foolishness. The next ten lines praise opening and closing of the parable: first six lines praise the opening, last four lines praise the closing. In the opening there are two; now the first four lines praise abandoning the jewel and not knowing, the last two lines praise the friend’s awakening. The remaining text is easy to see.

研真斷惑名為學，真窮惑盡名無學。研修真理慕求勝見，名之為學。學位在三果四向真無漏慧也；阿羅漢果，研理已窮勝見已極，無所復[2]學故名無學。約教釋品者，析法研真名之為學，惑盡真窮名為無學，三藏意也。體法研真名之為學，無真無惑名為無學，通意也。自淺之深名之為學，通別惑盡權實理窮名為無學，此別意也。研如來藏有學無學，法性實相非學非無學，而學而無學(云云)。是二千人，或是學或是無學人，同是一流，一時受記同一名號，故別為一品也。此品是授記文中第二段也。就此文為二：一、請記，二、授記。請中復二：一者二人請，二者二千[3]人請。二人請記復有二：一默念，二者發言請記。發言請記復二：一者引例亦應有分，二者引望。二人最親時眾所望，羅[4]雲是佛子俗中親重，阿難持佛法藏道中親勝，勝重兩人不蒙別記，則眾望不足也。

To study truth and cut off delusion is called “learner”; when truth is exhausted and delusions are ended it is called “non‑learner.” Investigating and cultivating true principle, admiring and seeking superior insight, is called learner. The learner’s rank is the three fruits and four paths of true non‑outflow wisdom; the arhat fruit, where investigation of principle is exhausted and superior insight is complete, with nothing further to learn, is called non‑learner. Explaining the chapter by teachings: in the Tripiṭaka, analyzing dharmas and investigating truth is learner, and ending delusion and exhausting truth is non‑learner. In the Common teaching, embodying dharmas and investigating truth is learner, and no truth and no delusion is non‑learner. In the Distinct teaching, from shallow to deep is learner; when delusions are ended and provisional/real principle is exhausted, it is non‑learner. In the Perfect teaching, investigating the Tathāgata‑store as learner/non‑learner: dharma‑nature true‑suchness is neither learner nor non‑learner, yet both learner and non‑learner (etc.). These two thousand people are either learners or non‑learners; all of one flow, receiving prediction at one time with one name, thus a separate chapter. This chapter is the second segment in the prediction text. The text has two: (1) request prediction, (2) give prediction. The request again has two: two persons request, and two thousand request. The two persons’ request again has two: silent thought and spoken request. The spoken request again has two: citing precedent that they too should have a share, and citing expectation. These two are most intimate and most hoped for: Rāhula is the Buddha’s son, closest in worldly ties; Ānanda holds the Dharma treasury, closest in Dharma ties. If these two do not receive a separate prediction, the assembly’s hope is not satisfied.

問：

Question:

---
若重若勝應同上流，何意在此？若如列眾，二人在上數中獲記，何意居下？

If weight and excellence should be with the upper stream, why are they here? If, as in the listed assembly, the two already received prediction among the upper ranks, why are they placed below?

---
答：

Answer:

---
總與千二百記，二人已同上流，今更索別記耳。阿難是學人，羅[＊4-1]雲弟子位，故入[＊2-1]學無[＊2-2]學章耳。二千請記但有默念、引例，二意同故言如阿難願耳。無發言者，無重無勝等事也。授記復二：一、先記二人，後記二千。阿難記中復五：一、長行，二、偈頌，三、八千菩薩生疑，四、如來發迹釋疑，五、阿難顯本述歎。疑者，通疑聲聞今日發心即蒙佛記國淨若此，昔方等中記諸菩薩，無量劫行乃得佛記，佛即發迹釋疑，昔日與我同發大心即是同學，由我精進前超得佛，由彼多聞猶故持經，迹為侍者本地如此，今授妙記何足可疑。餘記悉如文。[5]

The general bestowal of the twelve hundred already included the two in the upper stream; now they ask for a separate prediction. Ānanda is a learner; Rāhula is in the disciple position, thus they enter the “learners/non‑learners” chapter. The two thousand’s request has only silent thought and citing precedent; the two meanings are the same, so it says “like Ānanda’s wish.” Those without spoken request have no matters of weight or excellence. The giving of predictions again has two: first predict the two, then predict the two thousand. Ānanda’s prediction has five: (1) prose, (2) verse, (3) eight thousand bodhisattvas give rise to doubt, (4) the Tathāgata reveals traces to resolve doubt, (5) Ānanda reveals his original state and praises it. The doubt is that śrāvakas today arouse the mind and immediately receive prediction for a land so pure, while in the past the Buddha predicted bodhisattvas only after innumerable kalpas of practice; thus the Buddha reveals traces to resolve it: in the past, he and I together aroused the great mind and were fellow students; because I was diligent I became Buddha earlier, while he, though much‑hearing, still serves as keeper of the scriptures; in traces he is the attendant, and in original ground he is thus; now he receives the wondrous prediction—what could be doubtful? The remaining predictions are as in the text.

[6]此品五種法師：一受持，二讀，三誦，四解說，五書寫。《大論》明六種法師：信力故受，念力故持，看文為讀，不忘為誦，宣傳為說，聖人經書難解須解釋。六種法師，今經合受、持為一，合解、說為一，開讀誦為二，足書寫為五。別論四人是自行，一人是化他。《大經》分九品，前四人無解是弟子位，後五人有解是師位。通論若自軌五法，則自行之法師；若教他五法，則化他之法師。自軌故通稱弟子，化他故通稱法師。今從通義故名「法師品」。若作減數說者，束五為四，即四安樂行，如後說；若束四為三者，受持是意業，讀誦說是口業，書寫是身業，別論口業是化他，身意是自行，通論三業自軌，即是自行之法師，三業教詔，即化他之法師，故言「法師品」。又是三門行此五法以自熏修即福德門，弘宣五法廣利益者即化他門，自修益彼皆順佛教即報恩門。別論者，自修報恩名自行，益彼即化他；通論自軌軌他皆稱法師，故言「法師品」也。又讀誦書寫是外行，即如來衣；受持是內行，即如來座；解說益他是如來室。如來室別論是匠他，衣、座別論是自匠；通論不爾，慈悲覆物惠利歸己名之如室，遮彼惡、障己醜名之為衣，安心於空方能安他，安他安己名之為座，此則自軌三法亦名法師。利物必以慈悲入室為首，涉有[1]以忍辱為基，濟他以[2]亡我為本，能行三法大教宣通，即世間依止，故名法師。又束為二，謂自行、化他，此易解，不復記。又束為一，謂如來行具一切行，悲拔一切苦，謂四趣三界二乘菩薩等苦，慈與一切樂，謂人天涅槃常住等樂；柔和衣障一切醜，謂四住無知無明等醜；空座亡一切相，謂有相無相非有相非無相，此則通意。別意者，慈悲生一切善，柔和遮一切惡，[3]空座蕩一切相。又慈忍立一切福德，空座成一切智慧，智慧是目所謂五眼，福德是足所謂六度。又慈悲勝一切聲聞緣覺，柔和勝一切凡夫外道，空座勝析體偏等菩薩。故淨名云「譬如勝怨乃可為勇」。又慈悲破天魔，柔和破陰魔，[4]空破煩惱魔、死魔，大品云「化一切眾生，觀一切空，魔不得便」(云云)。又慈[5]忍故能問，空座故能答，具二莊嚴。又觀空故能問，慈忍故能答，慈忍故能種能立能資，空慧故能耘能破能導。又慈悲故何所隔？柔和故何[6]所礙？空座故何所諍？出三諦故名為勝幢，包含普攝名摩訶衍，是如來行故稱三昧王。經言，一切善法慈為根本，忍辱第一道無相最上，若論圓行說不可盡(云云)。

This chapter has five kinds of Dharma‑teachers: (1) receiving and holding, (2) reading, (3) reciting, (4) explaining, (5) copying. The *Great Treatise* explains six: by faith‑power one receives; by mindfulness‑power one holds; looking at the text is reading; not forgetting is reciting; transmitting and proclaiming is explaining; holy persons’ scriptures are hard to understand and require explanation. Of the six, this sutra combines receive and hold as one, combines explain and preach as one, separates reading and reciting as two, and adds copying to make five. In a separate discussion, four persons are self‑practice and one person transforms others. The *Great Sutra* divides nine grades: the first four without understanding are disciple‑rank; the latter five with understanding are teacher‑rank. Generally, if one self‑models the five dharmas, one is a Dharma‑teacher of self‑practice; if one teaches others the five dharmas, one is a Dharma‑teacher of transforming others. Self‑modeling thus generally called disciple; transforming others thus called teacher. Now from the general meaning, it is called the “Dharma Teacher” chapter. If speaking by reduction, bundling five into four gives the four peaceful practices (as later); bundling four into three: receiving/holding is mind‑karma, reading/reciting/explaining is mouth‑karma, copying is body‑karma. Separately, mouth‑karma transforms others; body and mind are self‑practice. Generally, the three karmas self‑model are self‑practice; the three karmas teach and instruct are transforming others; thus it is called “Dharma Teacher.” Again, there are three gates: practicing these five to self‑perfume is the merit gate; broadly proclaiming the five to benefit others is the transforming‑others gate; self‑cultivation and benefitting others both accord with the Buddha’s teaching, thus the gratitude‑repayment gate. Separately, self‑cultivation and repaying kindness is self‑practice; benefiting others is transforming others; generally, self‑modeling and modeling others are both called Dharma‑teachers, thus the “Dharma Teacher” chapter. Again, gathering into two: self‑practice and transforming others—this is easy and not recorded. Again, gathering into one: the Tathāgata’s practice contains all practices; compassion removes all suffering of the four destinies, three realms, two vehicles, and bodhisattvas; kindness gives all bliss of humans, gods, nirvāṇa, and permanence. The gentle robe covers all ugliness, namely the ugliness of the four abodes and ignorance; the empty seat erases all marks—marks of existence, non‑existence, neither‑existence nor non‑existence; this is the general meaning. Separately: compassion gives rise to all good; gentleness covers all evil; the empty seat sweeps away all marks. Again, compassion and patience establish all merit; the empty seat completes all wisdom: wisdom is the eye (five eyes), merit is the feet (six pāramitās). Again, compassion and patience surpass all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas; gentleness surpasses all ordinary people and outsiders; the empty seat surpasses the partial bodhisattvas of analytic/embodied teachings. Thus *Vimalakīrti* says, “Only one who overcomes enemies is called brave.” Again, compassion breaks the heavenly māra, gentleness breaks the skandha‑māra, and emptiness breaks the affliction‑māra and death‑māra; the *Great Perfection of Wisdom* says, “Transform all beings; contemplate all as empty; the māra cannot find a way” (etc.). Again, because of compassion and patience one can ask; because of the empty seat one can answer—thus the two adornments are complete. Again, by contemplating emptiness one can ask; by compassion and patience one can answer; compassion and patience can sow, establish, and support, and empty wisdom can weed, destroy, and guide. Again, by compassion nothing is blocked; by gentleness nothing is obstructed; by the empty seat nothing is contended. By going beyond the three truths it is named the Victory Banner; by containing and universally encompassing it is called Mahāyāna; as the Tathāgata’s practice it is called the Samādhi‑King. The sutra says: all good dharmas have compassion as root; patience is the first path; formlessness is supreme; if discussing the perfect practices, it cannot be exhausted (etc.).

事[7]一往論，必須登堂整服坐座，乃可敷弘，故約三耳。又事理合論，夫迷惑不出三種：一、約苦果起惑，二、約結業起惑，三、約諦理起惑，故用三門而示導之。又約理，迷真故墮苦，故用慈悲門；迷俗故沈空受樂，故用和忍門；迷中故成智障，故用空門(云云)。

Speaking only on the level of events, one must enter the hall, set the robes, and sit on the seat before one can proclaim; therefore it is explained by three. Speaking of events and principle together: delusion does not go beyond three kinds—(1) delusion arising from the bitter result, (2) delusion arising from binding karma, (3) delusion arising from truth‑principle—thus three gates are used to guide. Again, in terms of principle: deluded about the true and thus falling into suffering, so the gate of compassion is used; deluded about the conventional and thus sinking into empty pleasure, so the gate of gentleness and patience is used; deluded about the middle and thus forming wisdom‑obstruction, so the gate of emptiness is used (etc.).

法者軌則也，師者訓匠也，法雖可軌，體不自弘，通之在人，五種通經皆得稱師，舉法成其自行，皆以妙法為師，師於妙法自行成就，故言法師。又五種人能以妙法訓匠於他，故舉法目師，故稱「法師品」也。若自軌法、若法匠他，俱名法師者，則因緣釋品也。凡多種解，皆約圓教法門而釋品也。前三周是迹門，正說領解受記竟，此下五品是迹門流通，非止蔭益當時，復欲津洽來世，故有五品流通。〈法師〉、〈寶塔〉兩品，明弘經功深福重，流通未聞利益巨大；〈達多〉一品，引往弘經彼我兼益，以證功德深重；〈持品〉八萬大士忍力成者，此土弘經，新得記者他土弘經；〈安樂行〉一品，舊云，接退流通，或當如此未必全然。外凡初心欣斯勝福，見聲聞畏憚，聞菩薩擯辱，顧己力弱，無益自他，便生退沒，佛為此人說安樂行，依之法弘不慮危苦。又〈法師品〉，釋尊自說弘經功福命覓流通；〈寶塔品〉多寶分身，且證且助勸[8]覓流通，〈法師品〉初長行偈頌，歎[9]美五種法師能持法人，後長行偈頌，歎美所持之法。又示通經方軌，初復二：一、就稟道弟子門功深福重，二、授道師門功深福重。弟子門又二：一、佛世弟子，二、滅後弟子。初「因藥王告八萬」者，因者憑寄也，欲以妙法憑寄藥王，使其領受告[10]語八萬，皆流通也。指人問其見不者，的示持經得福之人也。佛世又二：一、從「告藥王」下，[11]揀出人類；二、從「咸於佛前」下，[＊11-1]揀出得記之緣。苦於佛前當機妙悟者，是多聞深解二千五百者是也，皆已現前與總別記竟，今所[＊11-2]揀類或是八部之類，或是四眾三乘之類，絓法華座席。「咸於佛前」者，明其時節，值佛在座也。「一句一偈」者，聞法極少也。「乃至一念」者，時節最促也。「皆與記當得菩提」者，明其聞極少、時極促，隨喜之功遂得佛果，何況具足得聞、盡形受持，五種流通三業供養(云云)。「聞一句一偈」者，聞少解淺之類今皆與記，少者尚記況復多深？以少況多普廣若此。下周既爾，中上亦然，可以意知不俟更說。《見實三昧經》別與四天王記同名火持，三十三天同名因陀羅幢王，拘翼同名無著，焰天同名淨智，兜率同名釋法王，上兩天亦通與記不顯別名，梵天名大智力，此是聞多解深之類，今與聞少解淺之類耳。舊云，支佛菩薩無受記，此文三乘皆記，不須疑也。「一偈一句」者，《增一集》云「隨取經中要偈，如四諦之流者是也」，《十住毘婆沙》云「惡賤名厭，不求名無欲，心無垢名解脫，捨檐名涅槃；惡賤於集，不求於苦，無垢是道，捨檐是滅」。又云「佛語滿宿，我有四句，所謂四諦四念處」等是也。觀心者，以一一句、以一一偈，無句無偈而不一者(云云)。若取迹門中要句開示悟入，乘是寶乘遊於四方，四安樂行勸發四意等是也。「一念隨喜」者，自未有行但隨喜法及人，功報尚多，況行到耶？隨喜[1]喜心有二：若聞開權顯實，即於一念心中，深解非權非實之理信佛知見，又能雙解權實事理圓融，雖具煩惱性，能知如來祕密之藏，此即豎論隨喜；又若聞開權顯實之意，即於一心廣解一切心，及一切法皆是佛法無有障礙，若欲分別辯說無窮，月四月至歲旋轉不盡，雖未得真隨喜心能如此解，法既如此人亦如是，此約橫論隨喜。即橫而豎、即豎而橫，故《大經》云「寧願少聞多解義味」即此意也，後當更說。

Dharma is a rule; teacher is a craftsman. Although the Dharma can be a rule, its substance cannot spread itself; it depends on persons. The five kinds of those who transmit the sutra can all be called teachers: by raising the Dharma they accomplish their own practice; all take the wondrous Dharma as teacher; the teacher, through the wondrous Dharma, completes self‑practice; therefore it is called “Dharma Teacher.” Again, five kinds of persons can craft others by the wondrous Dharma; therefore using the Dharma to name the teacher, it is called the “Dharma Teacher” chapter. If one self‑models the Dharma or uses the Dharma to craft others, both are called teachers; this is the causal‑conditions explanation of the chapter. Many explanations all interpret the chapter by the Perfect‑teaching dharma‑gate. The first three cycles are the trace‑gate; the proper preaching, understanding, and prediction are complete. The following five chapters are the trace‑gate’s circulation, not only benefiting that time but also to ferry and moisten later ages; thus there are five circulating chapters. The “Dharma Teacher” and “Jeweled Stūpa” chapters clarify that the merit of propagating the sutra is deep and weighty, and that the circulating, unheard benefits are vast. The “Devadatta” chapter cites past propagation, benefiting both others and self, to prove deep merit. The “Upholding” chapter: eighty thousand great beings perfected in patience; those newly predicted propagate here, those in other lands propagate there. The “Peaceful Practices” chapter: formerly it was said to pick up the retreating and circulate; perhaps so, but not entirely. Ordinary beginners delight in this superior merit; seeing śrāvakas are fearful and hearing bodhisattvas are slandered, they consider themselves weak and unbeneficial to self and others, and thus retreat; for such persons the Buddha teaches Peaceful Practices, so that by relying on the Dharma to propagate they need not fear danger and suffering. Again, in the “Dharma Teacher” chapter the World‑Honored One himself speaks of the merit of propagating the sutra and seeks circulation; in the “Jeweled Stūpa” chapter, Many‑Jewels and the division‑bodies both testify and assist in seeking circulation. In the “Dharma Teacher” chapter, the first prose and verses praise the five kinds of Dharma‑teachers who can uphold the Dharma‑person; the later prose and verses praise the Dharma that is upheld. It also shows the methods of transmission. First there are two: (1) the disciple‑gate with deep merit; (2) the teacher‑gate with deep merit. The disciple‑gate again has two: disciples in the Buddha’s time and disciples after extinction. First, “Because the Medicine King is told and the eighty thousand…”: “because” means to rely and entrust; he wishes to entrust the wondrous Dharma to Medicine King, so that he will accept it and tell the eighty thousand, all to circulate. He points to persons and asks whether they see them, thus clearly showing those who gain merit by upholding. In the Buddha’s time there are two: (1) from “telling Medicine King” downward, he selects the human class; (2) from “all in the Buddha’s presence” downward, he selects those with the conditions for prediction. Those who, in the Buddha’s presence, awaken to the wondrous meaning are the two thousand five hundred of deep hearing and understanding; they already received general and separate predictions. Those now selected may be of the eight classes or the four assemblies and three vehicles, tied to the Lotus seats. “All in the Buddha’s presence” indicates the time‑condition—meeting the Buddha in session. “One sentence, one verse” indicates hearing very little; “up to a single thought” indicates very short time; “all are predicted to attain bodhi” indicates that even with minimal hearing and time, rejoicing yields Buddhahood—how much more if one fully hears and upholds for one’s whole life, and makes three‑karma offerings in the five kinds of circulation (etc.). “Hearing one sentence, one verse” means those with little hearing and shallow understanding now are all predicted; if even the few are predicted, how much more those with much and deep? By the lesser, infer the greater. If the lower cycle is so, the middle and upper are also so; it can be known by intent without further saying. The *Seeing‑Real Samādhi Sūtra* separately predicts the Four Heavenly Kings all with the same name Fire‑Holder; the Thirty‑Three Heavens with the same name Indra‑Banner King; Kauṣika with the same name Unattached; the Heaven of Flame with the same name Pure Wisdom; Tuṣita with the same name Dharma‑King; the two higher heavens are also generally predicted without explicit separate names; Brahmā is named Great Wisdom‑Power. These are those with much hearing and deep understanding; now it predicts those with little hearing and shallow understanding. Formerly it was said that pratyekabuddhas and bodhisattvas do not receive prediction; this text predicts all three vehicles, so there is no need to doubt. “One verse, one sentence”: *Ekottara* says, “Take the essential verse in the sutra, such as the stream of the Four Truths.” *Daśabhūmika‑Vibhāṣā* says: “Vile is called disgust; not seeking is called no desire; mind without defilement is called liberation; abandoning attachment is called nirvāṇa; vile is with respect to accumulation, not seeking with respect to suffering, non‑defilement is the path, abandoning attachment is cessation.” It also says, “The Buddha’s words are vast; I have four phrases, namely the Four Truths and Four Foundations of Mindfulness,” etc. In contemplating mind, with one sentence or one verse—or with no sentence and no verse—there is nothing not one (etc.). If one takes the essential phrase in the trace‑gate—opening, showing, awakening, entering—ride this treasure‑vehicle and roam in the four directions; the four peaceful practices encourage the four intentions, etc. “A single thought of rejoicing” means: even if one has no practice yet, only rejoices in the Dharma and persons, the merit‑reward is still great—how much more if one practices to completion? Rejoicing has two: if one hears opening the provisional and revealing the real, then within a single thought one deeply understands the principle of neither provisional nor real and trusts the Buddha‑knowledge; one can also doubly understand the provisional and real in both principle and event as perfectly fused. Though one still has afflictive nature, one can know the Tathāgata’s secret treasury—this is vertical (sequential) rejoicing. Or if one hears the meaning of opening the provisional and revealing the real, then in a single mind one broadly understands all minds, and all dharmas are Buddha‑dharmas without obstruction; even if one wished to differentiate and explain, over four months and through yearly cycles it would not be exhausted—though one has not yet attained the true rejoicing‑mind, one can understand thus; the Dharma is thus and the person is thus. This is horizontal rejoicing. Thus horizontal and vertical are one. Therefore the *Great Sutra* says, “I would rather hear little and understand much in meaning and flavor”—this is that meaning, and will be further explained later.

從「告藥王又如來滅後」下，明佛滅後弟子，亦二：先出弟子類略舉於人，例上可知；次言「我亦與記」，功報如前解也。

From “Telling Medicine King and after the Tathāgata’s extinction” downward, it clarifies disciples after the Buddha’s extinction, also in two: first, it briefly lists the disciple types (as above can be inferred); next, it says “I also predict them,” and the merit‑reward is as explained above.

「若復有人」下，第二，師門，有長行、偈頌。長行有二：先別、後總。別者，人[2]譚下，上時[＊2-1]譚現未；總者，無論下，上及以現未，通明逆之得罪、順之得福也。就別復二：一、明現世，二、明來世。就現世復二：先明下品師，後明上品師。下品師為二：初、明師相，次、明師功報。師相者，即是五種法師，十種供養也。次「藥王當知是諸人等已曾供養」下，明下品功報也。「曾供養」者，先因深也。「愍眾生故生此人間」，明現功大也。「若有人問」下，明未來報重也。從「何[3]況盡能受持」者，明上品師，亦二：先況出上品師相；次「藥王當知，是人自捨清淨業報」，此明上品功報也。「若是善男子[4]於我滅後能竊為一人」下，明滅後師亦有下上。下品亦二：先出下品人者，即是但豎得其意，有慧無聞止堪竊說未可處眾，故是下品之師；「竊為一人說一句」者，雖得一句之解，既不廣聞多學異義，不可眾中而說，一切問難有所不通，便令正理不得宣弘，如《釋論》明有慧無聞，譬如小雨無雷，若欲申此一句正言，且當竊說耳。「當知是人則如來使」者，明其功報。經是如智所說、說於如理，今日行人秉此如教宣於如理，即是如來所使也。「行如來事」者，如智照如理為事，今日行人依如教行如理，即是行如來事也。一如智、一如理，化眾生為事，今日行人能有大悲，以此經中真如之理，為眾生說令得利益，亦名行如來事也。觀心解，如來使者，智心觀境境即真如，境來發智，智為如所使也。「如來所遣」者，觀智從如中來也。「行如來事」者，歷一切法無不真如，真如即佛事也。「何況於大眾中」下，明上品人，略不格量功報，此意可知也。「若有惡人」下，第二，總明五種法師，逆者得罪順者得福也。此中罪福不論福田濃瘠，但約初後心明其輕重。初心學人既具煩惱，若加障礙則所學事廢，故獲罪多；佛則平等，惡不干偪豈能障礙？故言罪輕。供養亦爾，此人有待，若得供養，所修事成，故施其福勝；佛則無待，眾事滿足，雖復獻供於佛無益，故言報劣。譬如王子在難，供奉所須其功甚大，若辱王種獲罪不輕，故罪福俱重；若獻大王衣食為要事微，汝欲侵陵不能致損，故罪福俱薄。「藥王」下，明讀誦、如佛莊嚴，即是順之得福。佛以定慧莊嚴，此人能修定慧故也。「為如來肩荷」者，在背為荷、在肩為檐，修非權非實法身之體，即是為如來荷，能[5]種能實二智之用，即是為如來檐。「隨所向方應向禮」者，上明以法為師，今明堪為物師。此人有趣向，悉與實相相應，皆可敬順，順即是向、敬即是禮，敬而順之及興供養等(云云)。

Below “If there are people” is the second, the teacher‑gate, with prose and verse. The prose has two: first, separate; then general. The separate: below “persons speak” (as above, present and future are spoken). The general: below “regardless,” it generally clarifies that those who go against it incur罪罪 and those who follow it gain merit, whether in present or future. The separate again has two: clarifying this life and future life. This‑life again has two: first, lower‑grade teachers; then, upper‑grade teachers. Lower‑grade teachers have two: first, the teacher’s characteristics; then, the teacher’s merit‑rewards. The teacher’s characteristics are the five kinds of Dharma‑teachers and the ten kinds of offerings. Below “Medicine King, you should know these people have already made offerings,” it clarifies the lower‑grade merit‑rewards. “Already made offerings” means the prior causes are deep. “Out of compassion for beings they are born in this human world” clarifies the greatness of present merit. Below “If someone asks,” it clarifies the heavy future reward. From “How much more can they fully receive and uphold” …, it praises the upper‑grade teacher. In the verses it praises the present upper‑grade teacher: first half‑line shows the upper‑grade teacher; below “Abandoning the pure land,” second, two and a half lines praise the merit‑reward. Below “After my extinction,” these three lines praise the future: first two lines leap‑praise the upper‑grade teacher, in two: first “After my extinction” half‑line praises the Dharma‑teacher; in the prose the merit‑reward was lacking, but here the verse has it. Below “They should join palms,” second, one and a half lines clarify the merit‑reward. Below “If one can in later ages,” second, one line, it retroactively praises the lower‑grade teacher. First half‑line shows the person; next “I will send them” half‑line praises the merit‑reward. Below “If in one kalpa,” second, six lines generally praise the overall gate. The overall gate also has two: first two lines praise those who oppose, gaining罪; below “If someone seeks the Buddha‑way,” second, four lines praise those who follow, gaining merit. Below “Medicine King, now I tell you,” third, one line praises the sutra’s honored wondrousness.

偈有十六行，為三：初二偈，不頌長行，別獎勸自行利他；次十三行，頌上師門別通；後一行歎經。頌別總中又二：初七行頌別，後六行頌總。上別門有現未，今初四行頌現，後三行頌未。上現未一師各有上下。今初，「若有能」下一行，頌下品，上半出法師，「當知佛所」下，半出功報也。「諸有能受持」，此[1]下三行，頌現在上品師，初半行出上品師。「捨於清淨土」下，第二，二行半，頌功報也。「吾滅後」下，此三行頌未來，初二行超頌況出上品，為二：今初「吾滅後」下半行，頌法師，長行中本闕功報，今偈則有。「當合掌」下，第二，一行半，明功報也。「若能於後世」下，第二，一行，追頌下品師。初半頌出人，次「我遣在」下，第二，[2]半頌，功報也。「若於一劫」下，第二，六行，總頌上總門。上總門亦二：初二行，頌逆者得罪；「有人求佛道」下，第二，四行，頌順之得福也。「藥王今告汝」下，第三，一行，歎經尊妙。

The verses have sixteen lines in three: first two verses, not praising the prose, but separately encouraging self‑practice and benefiting others; next thirteen lines praise the separate and general of the teacher‑gate; last one line praises the sutra. Within the separate/general praise there are two: first seven lines praise the separate, last six lines praise the general. In the separate gate there is present and future; now the first four lines praise the present, the next three lines praise the future. For present and future, each teacher has lower/upper grades. Now first, below “If there is one able,” one line praises the lower‑grade: the upper half shows the Dharma‑teacher, the lower half shows the merit‑reward. Below “You should know this person,” second line praises the upper‑grade teacher. Below “If he abandons the pure land,” third line praises the upper‑grade merit‑reward. Below “After my extinction,” fourth line praises the future upper‑grade teacher. Below “Those who hear one verse,” fifth line praises the future lower‑grade teacher. Thus the verse corresponds to the prose.

從「爾時佛復告」下，第二，歎所持法及弘經方法。所持法是自軌法，弘經法是軌他法。有長行、偈頌。長行，初、歎經法，次、方軌。歎為五：一、約法歎亦格量歎，二、約人歎，三、約處歎，四、約因歎，五、約果歎。法妙故人貴，人貴故處尊，處尊因圓，因圓果極也。初歎法者，已、今、當說，此經為最。有師解，已是《般若》，當是《涅槃》，《法華》之前小大相隔，《法華》已後已得會同，此經正是會三之始、歸一之初，故言第一。經歎《法華》在已、今、當外。此師闕一節(云云)。今初，言「已」者，《大品》已上漸頓諸說也。「今」者，同一座席，謂無量義經也。「當」者，謂《涅槃》也。《大品》等漸頓皆帶方便取信為易；今無量義一生無量，無量未還一，是亦易信；今《法華》論法，一切差別融通歸一法，論人則師弟本迹俱皆久遠，二門悉與昔反，難信難解，當鋒難事《法華》已說，《涅槃》在後則易可信也。「祕要之藏」者，隱而不說為祕，總一切為要，真如實相包蘊為藏。「不可分布」者，法妙難信，深智可授、無智益罪，故不可妄說也。「從昔已來未曾顯說」者，於三藏中不說二乘作佛，亦不明師弟本迹，方等《般若》雖說實相之藏，亦未說五乘作佛，亦未發迹顯本，頓漸諸經皆未融會故名為祕。此經具說昔所祕法，即是開祕密藏，亦即是祕密藏。如此祕藏未曾顯說。「如來在世猶多怨嫉」者，四十餘年不得即說，今雖欲說而五千尋即退座，佛世尚爾，何況未來！理在難化也。

From “At that time the Buddha again told” downward, second: praising the Dharma that is upheld and the methods of propagating the sutra. The upheld Dharma is the self‑modeled Dharma; the propagation Dharma is the Dharma that models others. There are prose and verse. The prose: first, praise the sutra‑Dharma; next, the methods. The praise has five: (1) praising the Dharma by dharma and by comparison, (2) praising by persons, (3) praising by place, (4) praising by cause, (5) praising by result. Because the Dharma is wondrous, people are noble; because people are noble, places are honored; places honored, causes are complete; causes complete, results are ultimate. First, praising the Dharma: past, present, and future teachings—this sutra is the foremost. Some teachers explain: the past is the *Prajñā*, the future is the *Nirvāṇa*; before the *Lotus* the small and great are separated; after the *Lotus* they are already harmonized; this sutra is the beginning of uniting the three and returning to the one, thus called first. The sutra praises the *Lotus* as beyond past, present, and future. That teacher lacks one segment (etc.). Now, “past” means the gradual and sudden teachings from *Mahāprajñā* and above; “present” means the same seat, i.e., the *Infinite Meaning Sutra*; “future” means the *Nirvāṇa Sutra*. The gradual and sudden of *Mahāprajñā* etc. all carry expedients and are easy to believe; the *Infinite Meaning* is easy to believe because one gives rise to the immeasurable and returns to one; now the *Lotus* discusses Dharma in which all differences融通归一 and discusses persons in which teacher and disciple, trace and origin, are all long‑distant—both gates are reversed from before—hard to believe and hard to understand; the hardest point is already spoken in the *Lotus*, so the *Nirvāṇa* after it is easy to believe. “Secret essentials treasury” means: hidden and not spoken is “secret”; gathering all is “essential”; true‑suchness real‑mark enveloping all is “treasury.” “Not to be distributed” means: the Dharma is wondrous and hard to believe; it should be given to the wise, and given to the unwise it increases罪, thus it should not be spoken rashly. “From long ago it has never been openly taught” means: in the Tripiṭaka it does not say the two vehicles become Buddhas, nor does it reveal teacher/disciple traces and origins; the Vaipulya and Prajñā speak the treasury of real‑mark but do not say the five vehicles become Buddhas or reveal traces and origins; the sudden and gradual sutras are not融會; therefore it is called secret. This sutra fully explains the formerly secret Dharma; it both opens the secret treasury and is itself the secret treasury. “While the Tathāgata is in the world there is still much resentment and jealousy” means: for forty‑plus years it could not be spoken directly; now though he wished to speak, the five thousand withdrew—if so in the Buddha’s time, how much more in the future; thus it is hard to transform.

「如來滅後其能書持」下，第二，約人歎也。此法在人則人尊貴。「如來衣覆」者，即是修學大忍為衣也，上文云「如來莊嚴」也。「佛護念」者，實相為佛、實智為子，尊崇實相發生實智，即為諸佛所護念也。四信為「信力」，四弘為「願力」，大智為「善根力」也。信則信理，理即法身；志願是立行，行即解脫；善根根固難動，此即般若。當知三力，即是三德祕密之藏，初心[3]棲此與佛不殊，故名「與如來共宿」也。又信力修畢竟空如來智，如來[＊3-1]棲畢竟空為舍，此人信力亦學畢竟空，故與如來共宿。「手摩頭」者，此人以願力善力自行權實以為機感，機感名頭；如來以化他權實二智名手，開發前人自行權實之頭，感應道交故言摩頭，摩頭即授記也。

Below “After the Tathāgata’s extinction, who can write and uphold,” second: praising persons. The Dharma in persons makes persons noble. “Clothed by the Tathāgata’s robe” means cultivating great patience as robe; above it said “Tathāgata’s adornment.” “Protected and remembered by the Buddha” means: real‑mark is Buddha, real‑wisdom is child; honoring the real‑mark and giving rise to real‑wisdom is being protected and remembered by all Buddhas. The four faiths are “faith‑power,” the four great vows are “vow‑power,” great wisdom is “good‑root power.” Faith trusts the principle, which is the Dharma‑body; aspiration and vows establish practice, which is liberation; good roots are firm and hard to move, which is prajñā. Know that these three powers are the secret treasury of the three virtues; the beginner who rests in this is not different from the Buddha, thus called “sharing the same lodging as the Tathāgata.” Again, faith‑power cultivates the Tathāgata‑wisdom of ultimate emptiness; the Tathāgata abides in ultimate emptiness as a dwelling; this person’s faith‑power also studies ultimate emptiness, thus he lodges with the Tathāgata. “The hand touches the head” means: this person uses vow‑power and good‑root power to cultivate self‑practice in provisional/real, becoming a response‑capacity; the response‑capacity is named the head. The Tathāgata uses the two wisdoms of transforming others in provisional/real as the hand, opening and developing the former person’s head of self‑practice in provisional/real; the resonance of response is thus called touching the head, and touching the head is prediction.

「在在處處」下，第三，約處歎。此法在處即處貴。夫佛生處、得道、轉法輪、入涅槃等處，法王所遊皆應起塔。此經是法身生處、得道之場、法輪正體、大涅槃窟，此經所在須塔供養。「不復安舍利」者，《釋論》云「碎骨是生身舍利，經卷是法身舍利」，此經是法身舍利，不須更安生身舍利。生法二身各有全碎，皆可解(云云)。

Below “Everywhere, in every place,” third: praising by place. Where this Dharma is, the place is honored. The Buddha’s birth, awakening, turning the wheel, and entering nirvāṇa are places where towers should be built; this sutra is the Dharma‑body’s birth place, the place of awakening, the very body of the Dharma‑wheel, the cave of great nirvāṇa—wherever this sutra is, towers should be built and offerings made. “No need to install relics” — the *Treatise* says, “Broken bones are body‑relics; scripture‑rolls are Dharma‑body relics.” This sutra is the Dharma‑body relic, so there is no need to install bodily relics. The body and Dharma bodies each have whole and broken; both are interpretable (etc.).

---
「若出家」下，第四，舉因歎。「若未善行菩薩道」者，稟前三教即是碎散法身舍利未能巧度，若入圓教即是全身舍利則巧度，巧度為善行也。「其有眾生」下，第五，舉果歎。文為五：一、明近果，二、開譬，三、合譬，四、釋近，五、[＊11-3]揀非。今初，明近果。「當知必得近三菩提果」者，〈安樂行〉中名為「近處」。此菩提果，佛眼佛智知見處為體，則有二種：一者初心菩提，二者後心菩提。今言近者，正近初住菩提。又望圓果而修圓因得似解者，名之為近。前約因歎，修通別因即是未善，去圓果遠也；若修圓因即是善行，去圓果近也。今以圓如實智為因，還以為果，道前真如即是正因，道中真如即為緣因亦名了因，道後真如即是圓果。故《普賢觀》云「大乘因者即是實相，大乘果者亦是實相。」《釋論》云「初觀實相名因，觀竟名果。」就理而論，真如實相無當因果亦非前後，若約眾生修行，則有前後及以因果也。

Below “If one leaves home,” fourth: praising by cause. “If one has not yet well practiced the bodhisattva path,” then receiving the earlier three teachings is like scattered Dharma‑body relics, not yet able to skillfully cross; if one enters the Perfect teaching, it is like a complete‑body relic and thus skillful crossing—skillful crossing is good practice. Below “If there are beings,” fifth: praising by fruit. The text has five: (1) clarify the near result, (2) open the parable, (3) combine the parable, (4) explain the nearness, (5) [*11‑3] exclude the non‑fit. Now first, clarify the near result. “You should know they will surely obtain the near fruit of three‑bodhi” — in the “Peaceful Practices” chapter this is called “near place.” This bodhi fruit has the Buddha‑eye, Buddha‑wisdom, and know‑and‑see as its substance; there are two: initial‑mind bodhi and later‑mind bodhi. “Near” here means near the first‑abiding bodhi. Again, relative to the perfect果, cultivating the perfect cause and attaining a likeness‑understanding is called near. Previously, praising the cause: cultivating common/distinct causes is “not yet good,” far from the perfect果; cultivating the perfect cause is “good practice,” near to the perfect果. Now using perfect‑as‑real wisdom as cause, and returning it as果: true suchness before the path is the正因; in the path it is the conditioning‑cause and also the revealing‑cause; after the path it is the perfect fruit. Thus *Samantabhadra Contemplation* says, “The Mahāyāna cause is real‑mark; the Mahāyāna fruit is also real‑mark.” The *Treatise* says, “First contemplating real‑mark is called cause; when contemplation is complete it is called fruit.” In principle, true‑suchness real‑mark has no fixed cause or fruit and no before/after; but in terms of beings’ practice there are before/after and cause/fruit.

「譬如有人」下，第二，開譬。為二釋：一、約觀門，二、約教門。觀門者，眾生之心具諸煩惱名「高原」，修習觀智名「穿掘」，方證理味如得清水。依通觀，乾慧地如「乾土」，性地為「濕土泥」，見諦為得清水。別觀從假入空，但見空不見不空，斷四住如鑿乾土，去水尚遠；從空出假，先知非假今知非空，因是二觀得入中道，能伏無明轉見濕土，去水則近也。圓觀中道非空非假而照空假，如漸至濕泥，四住已盡無明已伏，已得中道相似圓解故言如泥，若入初住發真中解，即破無明如泥澄清，得見中道如見清水。《法華論》云「佛性水」當知次第。次，約教門者，土譬經教，水喻中道，教詮中道如土含水。三藏教門未詮中道猶如乾土；方等、[1]般若帶於方便說中道義，如見濕土；法華教正直顯露說無上道，如見泥。因法華教生聞思修，即悟中道真見佛性，所發真慧不復依文，如獲清水無復土相。故《華嚴》云「十住菩薩所有慧身，不由他悟也。」有人言，初教如高原乾土，《大品》如濕土，《法華》如泥佛果如水。有人言，《維摩》、《思益》如乾土，《無量義》如濕土，《法華》如泥，佛果如水。有人言，《大品》如乾土，《無量義》如濕土，《法華》如泥，佛果如水。三家皆五時之說。生師云「受持法華求佛道，欲得如渴；三乘於一乘難信，於法華求解如高原；受持讀誦為穿。未能如聞而解，為未聞如乾土，能解為至泥。」注家同。有人云，此一解去佛遠，一解去佛近，初三師明諸教去佛遠、法華去佛近，後二解但於法華中論遠近。尋經應二義：一、舉餘經對《法華》明遠近，二、就《法華》論遠近。諸師失經旨。

Below “Like someone,” second: opening the parable, with two explanations: (1) by the contemplation‑gate, (2) by the teaching‑gate. In the contemplation‑gate, the mind of beings, endowed with afflictions, is called “high ground”; cultivating contemplative wisdom is called “digging,” and only then is the taste of principle verified, like obtaining clear water. In the common contemplation: the dry‑wisdom stage is “dry earth”; the nature‑stage is “moist earth and mud”; seeing the truths is obtaining clear water. In the distinct contemplation, from provisional to emptiness: one sees emptiness but not non‑emptiness; cutting the four abodes is like digging dry earth, still far from water. From emptiness to provisional: first knowing not‑provisional, now knowing not‑empty; by these two contemplations one enters the middle way, can subdue ignorance and turn to seeing moist earth, near to water. In the perfect contemplation, the middle way is neither empty nor provisional yet illumines empty and provisional; it is like gradually reaching moist泥: the four abodes are ended and ignorance is subdued; one has attained a likeness‑perfect understanding of the middle way, thus it is called like mud; if one enters first‑abiding and truly resolves the middle, one breaks ignorance like mud澄清 and sees the middle like seeing clear water. The *Lotus Treatise* says “Buddha‑nature water”—know the sequence. Next, by the teaching‑gate: earth is the teachings, water is the middle way; teachings explicate the middle way like earth含水. The Tripiṭaka teaching does not explicate the middle way, like dry earth; the Vaipulya and Prajñā with expedients speak middle‑way meaning like seeing moist earth; the Lotus teaching reveals the unsurpassed path directly, like seeing mud. From the Lotus teaching one generates hearing‑thinking‑cultivation and then awakens the middle way and sees Buddha‑nature; the true wisdom thus produced no longer relies on words, like obtaining clear water with no earth‑appearance. Thus *Huayan* says, “The ten‑abiding bodhisattvas’ wisdom‑body is not awakened by others.” Some say: the first teaching is high ground and dry earth, the *Mahāprajñā* is moist earth, the *Lotus* is mud, and the Buddha‑fruit is water. Others say: *Vimalakīrti* and *Siyi* are dry earth, *Infinite Meaning* is moist earth, *Lotus* is mud, and the Buddha‑fruit is water. Others say: *Mahāprajñā* is dry earth, *Infinite Meaning* is moist earth, *Lotus* is mud, and the Buddha‑fruit is water. These three are all five‑period explanations. The Master Sheng says: “Upholding the Lotus and seeking Buddhahood is like thirst; the three vehicles have difficulty trusting the one vehicle, and seeking understanding of the Lotus is like high ground; upholding and reciting is digging. Not yet able to understand as heard is dry earth; able to understand is reaching mud.” Commentators agree. Some say: one interpretation is far from Buddha, one is near to Buddha; the first three teachers make the other teachings far and the Lotus near; the latter two discuss far and near only within the Lotus. Reading the sutra should allow two meanings: (1) set other sutras against the Lotus to clarify far and near, (2) discuss far and near within the Lotus. The various teachers miss the sutra’s intent.

Question:

餘經何故去佛遠？

Why are the other sutras far from Buddhahood?

---
答：

Answer:

---
未開權，求佛人未決，《法華》唯一無三，永出退心，故去佛近，文云「決了聲聞法」。

Because expedients have not been opened, those seeking Buddhahood are not yet resolved. The *Lotus* has only one and no three, forever leaving退心; thus it is near to Buddhahood. The text says, “Decisively explains the śrāvaka dharma.”

Question:

[＊1-1]般若云何去佛遠？

[*1‑1] How is the *Prajñā* far from Buddhahood?

*[Critical apparatus: [＊1-1] 般【大】＊，波【甲】＊]*

---
答：未開權，邊則遠，始行菩薩不覺《般若》密化付財，則於其是遠。夫般若實慧方便，是三世佛法身父母，求佛者如老病人，兩健扶之遍能遠去，當知般若最勝。《法華》開權不異《般若》顯實，非般若外別有法華，法華、般若異名耳。既是諸師異釋，故錄之耳。

Answer: expedients have not been opened, so the edges are far. Beginning bodhisattvas do not觉 that *Prajñā* secretly transforms and entrusts wealth, thus for them it is far. Prajñā, real wisdom and expedient means, is the father and mother of the Buddha‑dharma of the three times; seekers of Buddhahood are like old and sick persons—two strong people扶 them and they can go far; thus prajñā is supreme. The *Lotus* opens the provisional and does not differ from the *Prajñā* revealing the real; there is no separate Lotus outside prajñā—Lotus and prajñā are different names only. Since these are varied interpretations by teachers, they are recorded here.

---
次「菩薩亦如是」下，第三，合譬。於《法華》中獲聞思修，即是圓觀三慧方能近果，非乾濕等教中聞思修也。

Next, below “The bodhisattva is also like this,” third: combining the parable. In the *Lotus*, obtaining hearing‑thinking‑cultivation is the three wisdoms of perfect contemplation, thus one can approach the fruit; it is not the hearing‑thinking‑cultivation of the dry/moist teachings.

---
「所以者何」下，第四，釋得近意也。「一切菩薩」者，明諸權因也。「三菩提」者，明一切權果也。權因權果皆攝屬此經，如乾濕等土悉依於水，故言攝屬也。「開方便門示真實相」者，光宅云：「昔鹿苑機雜，盛說三藏未明一理，爾時以權隱實，一理為權教所閉；今王城赴大機顯於真實，真實既顯則廢除昔教，昔教被廢故方便門開，一理既彰真實相顯也。」私謂此解乃是破方便，非開方便也。河西道朗云：「直[2]詺三為方便，即是開方便門。昔不言三是方便，故方便門閉，今詺三為方便，即示一為真實也。」私謂此釋符文。有人解，開教身兩方便，示教身兩真實，三[3]世佛唯有形聲權實，約此開示則十二八萬煥然了矣。私謂前二師約教開示，後人加之以身，此竊龍印之義而為己釋，還是破方便意非開義也。

Below “Why is this?” fourth: explaining the nearness. “All bodhisattvas” clarifies all provisional causes; “three bodhi” clarifies all provisional fruits. Provisional causes and fruits are all subsumed by this sutra, as dry and moist soils all rely on water; thus it says “subsumed.” “Opening the gate of expedient means and showing the true reality‑mark”: Guangzhai says, “Formerly, at Deer Park the capacities were mixed; the Tripiṭaka was strongly preached and one principle was not yet clarified; then the real was hidden by expedients and the one principle was closed by provisional teachings. Now at the royal city the great capacity is met and the true is revealed; once the true is revealed, the former teachings are abolished; because the former teachings are abolished, the gate of expedient means opens; once the one principle is manifest, the true reality‑mark is revealed.” I say: this explanation breaks expedients; it does not open expedients. Hexi Daolang says, “Directly naming the three as expedients is opening the gate of expedients. Formerly, not calling the three expedients, the gate was closed; now calling the three expedients, it shows the one as true.” I say: this fits the text. Some explain: opening two expedients of teaching and body, showing two truths of teaching and body; the three‑time Buddhas have only form and sound provisional/real; by this opening and showing, the twelve and eighty‑thousand are clearly illuminated. I say: the first two teachers interpret by the teaching, the latter adds the body; this steals the dragon‑seal’s meaning to explain for oneself—still breaking expedients, not the meaning of opening.

問：方便當體是門？為通實相故為門？私答：具二義，為實相門，可解。當體是門，如《華嚴》尋善知識得種種法門，[4]算砂觀海等。此二門各有開閉，昔不言三是方便，故其門掩；今說三是方便，故其門開。昔不說一是真[5]實，實門掩；今說一是真實，故實門開。二者，此方便復通實相，故三乘方便為一乘門。實相亦二義：一、當體虛通故名之為門，如《淨名》不二門、《華嚴》法界門等；二、能通方便作門，劉虬云「通[6]物之功乃由乎一，故一為方便之門，汲引之效頗賴於三，故三為真實之相。言非三則方便之門得開，語唯一則真實之相可示。」有人云，具論有三義：一、以三為方便一為真實；二、三一皆方便，非三非一為真實；三、三一為二，非三非一為不二，二不二皆權，非二非不二為實。此三[7]章得為門。如以三為一門，此以權通實，若以一為三門，以實起權，乃至二不二亦爾互得為門，亦互得為相，但不得互為權實耳。私謂以三為一門者，三乘通實相不？若不通則非門，須開三始得是門。若開三者非復三也，云何以三為實相門？又三非佛因，那得是實相門？破此一義，餘二例去(云云)。

Question: Is expedient in itself the gate, or is it the gate because it通 to real‑mark? I privately answer: it has both meanings, as a gate to real‑mark. In itself it is a gate, like in *Huayan* seeking good friends and obtaining various gates—counting sands and observing the sea, etc. These two gates each have opening and closing: formerly not calling the three expedients, so the gate was shut; now calling the three expedients, so the gate is open. Formerly not saying the one is true, so the real‑gate was shut; now saying the one is true, so the real‑gate is open. Second, these expedients also通 to real‑mark, thus the three‑vehicle expedients are the gate to the one vehicle. Real‑mark also has two meanings: (1) in itself it is empty and通, thus named a gate, like the non‑dual gate in *Vimalakīrti* or the dharma‑realm gate in *Huayan*; (2) it can通 expedients as a gate. Liu Qiu says, “The功 of通 things comes from the one; therefore the one is the gate of expedients. The effect of drawing in relies on the three; therefore the three are the marks of true reality. If not three, the gate of expedients can open; if only one, the true‑reality marks can be shown.” Some say, fully discussed there are three meanings: (1) take three as expedient and one as true; (2) three and one are both expedient, non‑three non‑one is true; (3) three and one are two, non‑three non‑one is non‑dual; the dual and non‑dual are provisional, non‑dual‑and‑non‑non‑dual is true. These three chapters can be gates. If three is a gate to one, this is expedient通 to true; if one is a gate to three, this is true giving rise to expedient; up to two and non‑two likewise—each can be gate and each can be mark, but they cannot mutually be expedient and true. I say: if three is a gate to one, do the three vehicles通 to real‑mark? If they do not通, then it is not a gate, and one must open the three before it is a gate. If one opens the three, then it is no longer three; how can three be a gate to real‑mark? Also, the three are not the Buddha‑cause—how can they be the real‑mark gate?破 this one meaning; the remaining two follow by analogy (etc.).

問：方便真實互得為門，亦得方便為方便門，實相為實相門不？此有四句，二如前，三、實相為實相門，四、方便為方便門。如名為義門、義為名門，由方便名顯方便義，故名為義門；由方便義應方便名，故義為名門，實相亦爾，《中論．序》云「實非名不悟，故寄中以宣之」即其事也。

Question: If expedient and true can mutually be gates, can expedient be the expedient‑gate and real‑mark be the real‑mark gate? There are four statements; two are as above; third, real‑mark is the real‑mark gate; fourth, expedient is the expedient gate. It is like name being the gate to meaning and meaning being the gate to name: by the expedient name one reveals expedient meaning, thus the name is the meaning‑gate; by the expedient meaning one responds to expedient name, thus meaning is the name‑gate. Real‑mark is the same. *Madhyamaka*, “Preface” says, “Without names the real is not awakened; therefore it is expressed by the middle”—this is the case.

[8]問：得以三顯三、以一顯一不？此亦四句，二如前，以三顯三者，言昔三異今一，此三在一外，今一異昔三，此一在三外，故一非三一，三非一三，悉是執見。破此病故，於一佛乘分別說三，故三是一三，汝等所行是菩薩道，故一是三一。三一既不相異，因緣之義，以因緣三一，顯自性三一，亦以自性三一，顯因緣三一，故云以三顯一、以一顯三。有人引十五處明門，〈方便品〉有二，〈譬喻品〉有六，〈信解品〉有三，〈化城品〉有二，〈法師品〉有一，〈觀音品〉有一。〈方便〉二者，智慧門，權智為實智門，生師云：「言教為門，言教說實智，故言教是實智門。」《法華論》同也。次云以種種法門宣示佛道，此用大乘教為門，譬喻六者：一、其家廣大唯有一門，還以大乘教為門；二、云所燒之門，此約三界限域為門，如詺家為門；三、唯有一門而復狹小，還是大乘教為門；四、三車在門外，還以三界為門；五、以佛教門出三界苦，此用小教為門；六、在門外立，依大乘用二死限域為門，小乘亦出一切煩惱外正習已盡，名在門外立也。〈信解品〉住立門側，大乘理教為門；二云猶在門外亦如前；三云長者門內如前。〈化城〉請開甘露門，亦大小教門，重門高樓閣，亦用小乘三空門。〈方便〉門如前釋。〈觀音〉亦以大教為門。今釋「開方便門」者，昔所不說今皆說之。昔說一切世間治生產業，何曾是於方便？今皆開之，即是實相不相違背。昔說小乘方便若小乘果，小乘果尚非實相門，況小方便而當是門？今皆開之即是實相，汝等所行是菩薩道，決了聲聞法，是諸經之王。昔說二為方便門者，今皆開之即是實相，寧復是門？咸令眾生開示悟入佛之知見，一色一香無非佛法，若門若非門，悉皆開之示真實相顯佛性水。若不開者則深固幽遠無人能到，而今開之即得見水無乾土也。又作三慧釋，一切皆屬此經，即圓聞慧也；此經開方便，即圓思慧也；示真實相者，即圓修慧也。此三幽遠，佛今開示即得覩真。

[8] Question: Can one use three to reveal three and one to reveal one? This also has four statements; two are as above. Using three to reveal three means: previously three differed from now’s one; the three were outside the one. Now’s one differs from the former three; the one is outside the three. Therefore the one is not a three‑one, and the three are not a one‑three—both are执 views. To break this illness, within the one Buddha‑vehicle the three are differentiated; thus the three are a three‑one, and what you practice is the bodhisattva path, thus the one is a one‑three. Since three and one are not different, by the meaning of causes and conditions one uses conditioned three‑one to reveal self‑nature three‑one, and uses self‑nature three‑one to reveal conditioned three‑one; therefore it says to use three to reveal one and one to reveal three. Some cite fifteen places that clarify “gate”: the *Expedient Means* chapter has two, the *Parable* chapter has six, the *Faith and Understanding* chapter has three, the *Magic City* chapter has two, the *Dharma Teacher* chapter has one, the *Avalokiteśvara* chapter has one. The two in *Expedient Means* are the wisdom‑gate: provisional wisdom is the gate to real wisdom. Master Sheng says: “Verbal teaching is the gate; verbal teaching speaks real wisdom, thus verbal teaching is the real‑wisdom gate.” The *Lotus Treatise* agrees. Next it says “Using various dharma‑gates to declare the Buddha‑way”: this uses the Mahāyāna teaching as the gate. The six parables are: (1) the house is vast and has only one gate—again using the Mahāyāna teaching as the gate; (2) the gate where it burns—using the three‑realms boundary as the gate, like calling the house the gate; (3) only one gate but it is small—again the Mahāyāna teaching as the gate; (4) the three carts are outside the gate—again using the three realms as the gate; (5) using the Buddha‑teaching gate to exit the suffering of the three realms—here the small teaching is the gate; (6) standing outside the gate, relying on the Mahāyāna to use the boundary of the two deaths as the gate; the small vehicle also exits beyond all afflictions and its direct and habitual contaminants are exhausted, so it is named standing outside the gate. The *Faith and Understanding* chapter: “standing at the gate’s side” uses the Mahāyāna principle‑teaching as the gate; “still outside the gate” is also as above; “within the elder’s gate” is as above. The *Magic City* chapter: “please open the nectar gate” is also a gate of large and small; the “multiple gates and lofty towers” also use the small vehicle’s three emptiness gates. The *Expedient Means* gate is as explained above. The *Avalokiteśvara* also uses the great teaching as the gate. Now explaining “opening the gate of expedient means”: what was previously not spoken is now all spoken. Formerly, worldly livelihoods and industries were never called expedients; now all are opened—this is not contrary to real‑mark. Formerly, the small vehicle expedients and the small‑vehicle fruit—if the fruit itself is not a real‑mark gate, how much less are the small expedients a gate? Now all are opened; this is real‑mark—“what you practice is the bodhisattva path; it decisively explains the śrāvaka dharma; it is the king of sutras.” Formerly, saying the two are expedient gates—now all are opened and are real‑mark; how can they still be gates? It causes all beings to open, show, awaken, and enter the Buddha’s knowledge and vision; one color and one fragrance are all Buddha‑dharmas. Whether gate or not‑gate, all are opened, showing true‑reality and revealing the Buddha‑nature water. If not opened, it is deep and幽遠 and no one can reach; now it is opened and one sees water with no dry earth. It also explains by the three wisdoms: all are subsumed by this sutra—this is perfect hearing‑wisdom; this sutra opens expedients—this is perfect thinking‑wisdom; showing true‑reality is perfect cultivation‑wisdom. These three are deep and far; now the Buddha opens and shows them and one can see the true.

「藥王若有菩薩聞」下，第五[＊11-4]揀非。若菩薩聞此說而驚疑、聲聞上慢，悉是乾土，尚非濕土況見水耶？

Below “Medicine King, if a bodhisattva hears,” fifth: [*11‑4] excluding the unfit. If a bodhisattva hears this teaching and is startled and doubtful, or a śrāvaka is arrogant, they are all dry earth—still not moist earth, how could they see water?

從「若有善男子善女人如來滅後」下，第二，略示弘經方法。又為二：一、示方法，二、明利益。方法為三：一、標章門，二、解釋，三、勸修。修如來室是大慈悲，若就同體即法身也；若被眾生即是解脫；能令眾生會於同體即是般若。修如來衣者，若就所覆，即法身也；若就能覆嚴身，即寂滅忍也；若[1]就和光利物即解脫也。若就能坐即般若也；若就所坐即法身也；身座冥稱即解脫也。又大慈安樂即資成，柔和伏嗔斷惑即觀照，坐座即法身。〈安樂行〉中還廣此三法，上文「如來莊嚴」即衣也，上云「如來肩所[2]荷」者即此座也，檐者即檐運是入室也。「我於餘國」下，第二，舉五利益勸獎流通：一、遣化人，二、遣化四眾，三、遣八部，四、見佛身，五、與總持也。若初心未淳，止可遣化人，未可遣化四眾八部，若見天龍倚此自高妨損其道，故不可令[3]見也；若心無倚著則堪見佛，況復天龍，況得總持自證利益耶？

From “If there are good men and good women after the Tathāgata’s extinction,” second: briefly showing methods of propagating the sutra. Again in two: (1) show the methods, (2) clarify the benefits. Methods are three: (1) mark the chapter‑gate, (2) explain, (3) encourage cultivation. Cultivating the Tathāgata’s room is great compassion: in terms of same‑body it is Dharma‑body; as bestowed on beings it is liberation; enabling beings to meet the same‑body is prajñā. Cultivating the Tathāgata’s robe: as what is covered, it is Dharma‑body; as what covers and adorns the body, it is the patience of extinction; as harmonizing light and benefiting beings, it is liberation. As what can sit it is prajñā; as what is sat upon it is Dharma‑body; the matching of body and seat is liberation. Again, great compassion and ease are the supporting completion; gentle subduing of anger and cutting off delusion is contemplation; sitting on the seat is Dharma‑body. In the “Peaceful Practices” chapter these three dharmas are further expanded; above, “Tathāgata’s adornment” is the robe; above, “what the Tathāgata’s shoulders carry” is the seat; the carrying‑beam is entering the room. Below “In other lands I…” second: listing five benefits to encourage circulation: (1) sending transformation‑persons, (2) sending transformation‑four assemblies, (3) sending the eight classes, (4) seeing the Buddha‑body, (5) granting dhāraṇī. If the beginner’s mind is not yet pure, one should only send transformation‑persons, not yet the four assemblies and eight classes; if one sees gods and dragons, one may rely on them and become arrogant, harming the path, so they should not be seen. If the mind has no reliance, then one can see the Buddha, let alone gods and dragons, and can even obtain dhāraṇī and self‑verified benefit.

偈有十八行半，為三：初一行，總勸不頌長行；次十六行半，頌上長行；後一行，結勸。上約果歎文有五，今初一行半頌開譬；次「藥王汝當[4]知」，第二，二行半，頌合譬，略不頌餘三，近果、釋、[＊11-5]揀非等也。上通經方軌中有二：方軌、利益；今十二行半頌，初三行半，頌方[5]軌，中有三，今亦頌三意也。「我千萬億」下，次九行，頌利益。初一行總明如來以五事利益之意，正由應身遍滿十方，能為五事守護行人。「若我滅後」下一行半，頌第二遣四眾。「引導」下一行半，頌第一遣化人。「若說法之人」下二行，頌第五令得總持。「若人具是德」下一行，頌第四令得見佛。「若人在空閑」下二行，頌第三遣八部(云云)。[6]

The verses have eighteen and a half lines, in three: first one line, generally exhorting without praising the prose; next sixteen and a half lines, praising the prose above; last one line, concluding the exhortation. In the prose above there are five in the fruit‑praise; now the first one and a half lines praise opening the parable. Next, below “Medicine King, you should know,” second: two and a half lines praise combining the parable, omitting praise of the other three—near fruit, explanation, and [*11‑5] exclusion. Above, in the methods of transmission there are two: method and benefit; now twelve and a half lines praise them. The first three and a half lines praise the method, and within it are three, also praised here. Below “I, for innumerable billions,” the next nine lines praise benefits. The first line generally clarifies the Tathāgata’s intent to benefit by five matters; precisely because the response‑body pervades the ten directions, it can guard and protect practitioners in five matters. Below “After my extinction,” one and a half lines praise the second, sending the four assemblies. “Leading and guiding” one and a half lines praise the first, sending transformation‑persons. Below “If one who preaches the Dharma,” two lines praise the fifth, granting dhāraṇī. Below “If a person has these virtues,” one line praises the fourth, enabling seeing the Buddha. Below “If a person is in a quiet place,” two lines praise the third, sending the eight classes (etc.).
