## Explanation of the Vision of the Jeweled Stupa Chapter

**(Text Lines 192-231)**

### 1. Title Explanation

**"Vision of the Jeweled Stupa" (*Jiàn Bǎo Tǎ Pǐn*):**
*   **Stupa (*Tǎ Pó*):** Sanskrit *Stupa* or *Thupa*. Translated as "Square Grave" (*Fāng Fén*) or "Sacred Shrine" (*Líng Miào*). Also called *Caitya* (*Zhī Tí*) if it contains no bodily relics.
    *   *Note:* Since this Stupa contains the Whole Body (of Prabhutaratna) undispersed, it is technically not a Caitya (which usually lacks relics), but the text and tradition vary.
    *   *Four Caityas (Agama):* Birth, Enlightenment, Turning Wheel, Nirvana.
    *   *Lotus Stupa:* The Stupa of the **Primal Buddha's Nirvana**.
*   **Significance:**
    *   **Three Bodies:** The Buddha's Three Bodies are born from this Sutra.
    *   **Proof:** The Stupa emerges to prove the validity of the previous teaching ("Opening the Provisional").
    *   **Four Assemblies See It:** Hence "Vision" (*Jiàn*).
*   **Whole vs. Fragmented Relics:**
    *   *Small Vehicle:* Fragmented relics (bones) vs. Whole body.
    *   *Lotus:* The **Dharma Body** is the Relic. This Sutra is the Whole Body of the Dharma Body.
*   **Why Now?**
    *   *Northern Master's View:* It should have appeared during the preaching. Appearing after seems late.
    *   *Tiantai Critique:* It appears to prove the **Three Weeks of Preaching** (Dharma/Parable/Causality) were True. And to open the **Future** (lifespan).
*   **Symbolism of the Stupa:**
    *   **From Earth:** Shows the Dharma Body is not extinguished (Permanent).
    *   **In Sky:** Shows the Dharma Body is transcendent (Space-like).
    *   **Duo Bao (Many Jewels):** Represents the **Dharma Body Buddha** (Truth).
    *   **Shakyamuni:** Represents the **Reward Body Buddha** (Wisdom).
    *   **Branch Buddhas:** Represents the **Response Body Buddha** (Action).
    *   *Three in One:* Though three, they are not different.

### 2. Analysis of the Chapter

1.  **Appearance of the Stupa.**
2.  **Offerings by Gods.**
3.  **Duo Bao's Praise.**
4.  **Assembly's Surprise/Doubt.**
5.  **Great Joy of Preaching (Da Le Shuo) Asks.**
6.  **Buddha Answers.**

**A. Appearance of the Stupa:**
*   **Seven Jewels:** Represents the Seven Factors of Enlightenment and Seven Noble Wealths naturally possessed by the Dharma Body.
*   **Height (500 Yojanas):** Vertical Causes (Ten Thousand Practices) and Result (Ten Thousand Virtues).
*   **Width (250 Yojanas):** Horizontal Virtues.
*   **From Earth:** Breaking Ignorance (Earth) to dwell in First Principle Emptiness.

*   **"All is Truth" (*Jiē Shì Zhēn Shí*):**
    *   *Specific:* Matches the Reality Mark.
    *   *General:* Matches the Absolute (beyond words).
    *   *Middle:* Matches the Eight Negations.

**C. Doubt and Question:**
*   **Question 1:** Why this Stupa?
*   **Question 2:** Why from the Earth?
*   **Question 3:** Why the Sound?
*   *(Buddha answers only #2 and #1 explicitly, #3 implies proof).*

**D. Branch Buddhas and Opening the Stupa:**
*   **Shakyamuni's Light:** Summons the Branch Buddhas from ten directions.
    *   *Why?* To open the Stupa (Prabhutaratna's Vow: "When my Stupa is opened, all Buddhas must gather").
    *   *Meaning:* Gathering the Traces (Branch Buddhas) to return to the Origin (Dharma Body).
*   **Purifying the Lands (Three Transformations):**
    *   1st: Purifying Saha (Turning Earth to Lapis Lazuli). Removes **Great Earth** (Desire/Form).
    *   2nd: Purifying 200 Myriad Lands. Removes **Dust/Sand** (Bodhisattva's ignorance).
    *   3rd: Purifying another 200 Myriad. Removes **Ignorance**.
*   **Opening the Stupa:** 
    *   *"Like opening a lock":* Removing the obstruction.
    *   **Sharing the Seat:** Shakyamuni enters and sits with Duo Bao.
        *   *Meaning:* Trace (Shakyamuni) and Origin (Duo Bao) are Non-Dual.
        *   *Structure:* "Three Buddhas" (Duo Bao, Shakyamuni, Branches).

### 3. Entrustment (Selling the Dharma)

**(Lines 226-231)**
**"Shakyamuni sees the Buddhas gathered..."**
*   **The Advertisement (Casting the Net):** "Who can guard this Sutra?"
*   **Reason:** "The Tathagata will soon enter Nirvana."
*   **Two Entrustments:**
    1.  **Near:** To the 80,000 Bodhisattvas present.
    2.  **Far:** To the "Underground" Bodhisattvas (implied/future).

**Verses (48 Lines):**
*   Praising the Stupa, the gathering, and the difficulty of holding the Sutra.
*   **"Six Difficulties and Nine Easies":**
    *   *Easy:* Kicking the galaxy, holding the earth, preaching other sutras.
    *   *Difficult:* Preaching/Holding the *Lotus Sutra* in the evil age.
    *   *Why?* Because it attacks the root of ignorance and requires the full "Opening of the Provisional."

## Explanation of the Devadatta Chapter

**(Text Lines 232-275)**

### 1. Title and Historical Context

**"Devadatta" (*Tí Pó Dá Duō*):**
*   **Meaning:** *Deva* = Heaven/God. *Datta* = Given (*Tiān Shòu*) or Heat (*Tiān Rè*).
    *   **Trace Interpretation:** Born when the gods were hot/feverish/angry. "Heavenly Heat."
    *   **Origin Interpretation:** The Bodhisattva manifests "Heat" (Desire/Anger) equal to the sentient beings' "Fever" to cure them. (Principle of "Same Illness, Same Cure").
*   **Textual History (Bao Chang's Catalog):**
    *   **Translations:** Four versions. Dharmaraksha (Western Jin) translated the *Zheng Fahua* (Correct Lotus). Kumarajiva (Later Qin) translated the *Miao Fahua* (Wonderful Lotus).
    *   **Missing Chapter:** In Kumarajiva's original translation (at Chang'an), the "Devadatta Chapter" was missing or kept separate (called the *Tian Pin*). Later, Fa Xian obtained the Sanskrit text in the South.
    *   **Reintegration:** Master Paramartha (Liang Dynasty) and Nanyue Huisi (Chen Dynasty) integrated it. Huisi placed it *after* the Stupa chapter, matching Dharmaraksha's version. Tiantai Zhiyi follows this ordering.

### 2. Analysis of the Chapter

The chapter has two main sections:
1.  **Past (King and Seer):** Shakyamuni (King) and Devadatta (Seer). Shows the **Merit of the Teacher** (Devadatta) and the **Diligence of the Disciple** (Shakyamuni).
2.  **Present (Manjushri and Dragon Girl):** Shows the effectiveness of the Sutra in the present (Dragon Girl's Instant Buddhahood).

**A. The Past: King Seeking Dharma**
*   **The King:** A past life of Shakyamuni. He was a King who "bored holes in his body to light lamps" (in other sutras) or served as a slave (here) for the Dharma.
*   **The Seer (*Asita*):** A past life of Devadatta. He possessed the *Lotus Sutra*.
*   **Six Paramitas (Hexadu):**
    *   The King sought to fulfill the Six Paramitas.
    *   *Tiantai Analysis of the Six Paramitas:*
        1.  **Tripitaka Level:** Giving material wealth, keeping rules against 7 sins, etc. (Counteractive).
        2.  **Common Level:** Giving with "Three Wheels Empty" (No Giver, Receiver, Gift).
        3.  **Separate Level:** Giving with "Ten Benefits" (countering stinginess, etc.).
        4.  **Round Level:** "Seeking the Buddha Way." Every act of giving is for the sake of the One Vehicle.
*   **32 Marks:** The text mentions fulfilling the 32 Marks.
    *   *Examples:* Flat feet (Firm Charity), Long fingers (Non-Killing), etc.
    *   *Tiantai:* These are the "Trace Marks" (Reward Body). The Real Mark is the "Dharma Body Mark" (No Mark).

**B. Convergence and Prophecy:**
*   Shakyamuni says: "Because of Devadatta's Good Friend ( *Shàn Zhī Shí*) power, I attained the 32 Marks and Buddhahood."
*   **Prophecy:** Devadatta will become **Heavenly King Buddha** (*Tiān Wáng Fó*).
    *   *Significance:* Even though Devadatta committed the **Five Deadly Sins** (Wounding Buddha, Killing Arhat, etc.) in the Trace, his **Origin** is a Great Bodhisattva who helped the Buddha.
    *   This proves that there is no fixed "Evil" nature; the Lotus can transform even the Ichantika.

**C. The Present: Manjushri and the Dragon Girl**
*   **Manjushri from the Sea:**
    *   Wisdom Accumulation Bodhisattva (*Zhì Jī*) asks: "How many beings have you saved?"
    *   Manjushri: "Innumerable." (Lotus flowers emerge from the sea to prove it).
*   **Dragon Girl's Enlightenment:**
    *   **The Being:** Daughter of Dragon Sagara. 8 Years Old.
    *   **The Act:** Offers a Precious Jewel to the Buddha.
    *   **The Speed:** "Is this offer quick?" "Yes." "My becoming a Buddha is faster than that."
    *   **The Transformation:** Instantly turns into a male, goes to the Southern Spotless World, and sits on the Lotus Throne as a Buddha.
*   **Meaning:**
    *   **Dragon (Animal):** Overcoming the obstruction of lower rebirth.
    *   **Female:** Overcoming the obstruction of gender (Five Obstructions).
    *   **Young (8 Years):** Overcoming the obstruction of time/age.
    *   **Southern World:** Represents the Sravaka (Growth/Rightness).
    *   **Instant:** This is the **Power of the Lotus Sutra** (*Lì Yòng*). It opens the Provisional (Dragon/Female body) to reveal the Real (Buddha Nature).
    *   **Silent Faith:** Sariputra (representing the doubting Sravaka) and Wisdom Accumulation (representing the doubting Bodhisattva) are silenced by the fact.
