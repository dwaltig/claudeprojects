## 13. MAITREYA'S VERSES (彌勒偈)

### [OVERVIEW: WHY MAITREYA ASKS]
The *Introduction Chapter* serves as the narrative frame for the entire Sutra. The dramatic tension is built through **Doubts (*Yí*)**. The Great Assembly witnesses the Six Omens (Flowers, Earth Shaking, Light, etc.) but does not understand their cause. **Maitreya**, the Future Buddha, acts as the representative doubter. He asks **Manjuśrī**, the Past Buddha (teacher of seven Buddhas), who acts as the historical authority. This dialogue between the **Future** (Action/Capacity) and the **Past** (Wisdom/Authority) establishes the continuity of the **One Great Matter** across all time.

### [GENERAL ANALYSIS OF VERSES]

**從「爾時彌勒欲自決疑」下訖偈，即是發問序，文為二：長行、偈頌。**

**From "At that time Maitreya wished to resolve his doubts" down to the end of the verses, this is the **Preface of Asking Questions** (*Fā Wèn Xù*). The text has two parts: Prose and Verses.**

---

**長行中經家述自疑、他疑發問。**

**In the Prose, the Sutra Compiler narrates the self-doubt and other-doubt to initiate the questioning.**

---

**問中此土、他土如文，何意有偈頌耶？**

**In the questioning, [the doubts regarding] This Land and That Land are as in the text. Why is there a Verse Section (*Gāthā*)?**

---

**龍樹《毘婆沙》云：**

**Nāgārjuna's *[Mahā]vibhāṣā [Śāstra]*[^2] says:**

**「一、隨國土天竺有散花、貫花之說，如此間序、後銘也；**

**1.  **According to the Country:** India (*Tiānzhú*) has the convention of 'Scattered Flowers' (Prose) and 'Strung Flowers' (Verse); this is like the 'Preface' (*Xù*) and 'Post-Inscription' (*Míng*) in this land [China].**

**二、隨樂欲不同，有樂散說，或樂章句；**

**2.  **According to Delight/Desire:** [Beings] differ; some delight in scattering exposition (Prose), some delight in stanzas (Verse).**

**三、隨生解不同，或於散說得解，或於章句得解；**

**3.  **According to Arising of Understanding:** Some obtain understanding from prose, some obtain understanding from stanzas.**

**四、隨利鈍，利者一聞即悟，鈍者再說方悟。」**

**4.  **According to Sharp and Dull:** The Sharp one awakens upon one hearing; the Dull one awakens only after it is said again.**

---

**又表佛殷勤重說，又為眾集前後故有偈也。**

**Also, it symbolizes the Buddha's **Solicitous Repetition** (*Yīnqín Chóngshuō*) [earnestness]. Also, there are verses for the sake of the assembly gathering early or late [so latecomers hear the teaching].**

---

**偈有六十二行，文為兩：初五十四行頌上問，後八行請答。**

**The Verses have sixty-two lines [stanzas]. The text has two parts: The first fifty-four lines recount the **Questions** above; the latter eight lines **Request an Answer**.[^1]**



---

**就問為兩：前四行，問此土；後五十行，問他土。**

**Regarding the **Questioning**, there are two parts: The first four lines ask about **This Land**; the latter fifty lines ask about **That [Other] Land**.**

---

**長行總問此土六瑞，偈中長有香風地淨，無說法入定。觀文謂言盈縮，尋義不然。**

**The Prose generally asks about the Six Omens of This Land. The Verses extend [add] "Fragrant Wind" and "Ground Purification," but lack "Expounding Dharma" and "Entering Samādhi." Looking at the text, one might call this **Existing/Shrinking** (*Yíng Suō* - Adding/Subtracting). Seeking the meaning, it is not so.**

---

**說法是慧性，入定是天心，由天心慧性，能作動地放光，舉末即能知本故，縮非縮也。**

**"Expounding Dharma" is **Wisdom Nature** (*Huì Xìng*). "Entering Samādhi" is **Heavenly Mind** (*Tiān Xīn*). Because of Heavenly Mind and Wisdom Nature, one can create Earth Shaking and Light Emission. Raising the Branch [Omen] enables knowing the Root [Samādhi/Wisdom]; thus, "Shrinking" is **Not Shrinking** (*Suō Fēi Suō*).**

---

**他不見此意，謂彌勒不問兩事，便不以為瑞。今反難之，若彌勒不問，文殊何故而答？**

**Others [Old Masters like Fayun/Guangzhai] do not see this intent; they say Maitreya did not ask about these two matters [Dharma/Samādhi], so they are not Omens. Now I counter-question them: If Maitreya did not ask, why did Manjuśrī answer [about them]?**

---

**又，問指何處為問？今指長行，總問是也，若更顯其別問，秖導師兩字是也。**

**Also, if you ask "Where is the Question point?", I point to the Prose—the **General Question** is it. If we further reveal the **Specific Question**, it is simply in the two words **"Guide/Teacher"** (*Dǎoshī*).**

---

**良以說法、入定能導於人，既稱導師，即是問說法、入定也，是故非縮。**

**Ideally, Expounding Dharma and Entering Samādhi can **Guide** people. Since he is called "Guide," this *is* asking about Expounding Dharma and Entering Samādhi. Therefore, it is **Not Shrinking** (Omission).**

---

**他云：「風由檀林故香，地加之嚴淨，盈長兩事。」今謂非盈，風本無香而香，為奇特故以成瑞...**

**Others say: "Wind is fragrant because of Sandalwood forests; the ground adds adornment and purity. This is **Adding/Extending** (*Yíng*) two matters." I say it is **Not Adding**. Wind originally has no fragrance yet becomes fragrant; because it is rare/special (*Qí Tè*), it becomes an Omen...**

---

### [ASKING ABOUT OTHER LANDS] (問他土)

**「眉間光」下，次有五十行，頌問他土六瑞...**

**From "Brow Light" downwards, next are fifty lines of verse asking about the Six Omens of **Other Lands**...**

**舊云：「頌中不問三乘四眾，不問佛涅槃。今教廢三，那忽問三？方說壽量，那問滅度？於義不便故不問也。」**

**Old masters say: "The verses do not ask about the Three Vehicles, the Four Assemblies, or the Buddha's Nirvana. [They argue:] The Current Teaching [Lotus] discards the Three, so why suddenly ask about Three? It is about to expound the [Eternal] Life Span, so why ask about Extinction? It is inconvenient to the meaning, therefore he does not ask."**

---

**嗚呼！不解消文，抑經就情。今明頌中具問他土六瑞，文為六：**

**Alas! They do not understand how to explain the text, suppressing the Sutra to fit their sentiments. Now I clarify: The Verses fully ask about the Six Omens of **Other Lands**. The text has six parts:**

1.  **初、三行問六趣眾生；** (First, 3 lines ask about sentient beings of Six Destinies.)
2.  **二、四行問見彼佛及說法；** (Second, 4 lines ask about Seeing the Buddhas and Expounding Dharma.)
3.  **三、三行問他土四眾；** (Third, 3 lines ask about the Four Assemblies of Other Lands.)
4.  **次、一行半結前開後；** (Next, 1.5 lines Conclude the Previous and Open the Subsequent.)
5.  **次、三十一行半，問他土修菩薩行；** (Next, 31.5 lines ask about cultivating Bodhisattva Practices in Other Lands.)
6.  **次、七行問供養舍利，即是問佛涅槃也。** (Next, 7 lines ask about Offering to Relics, which is asking about Buddha's Nirvana.)

---

### 1. SIX DESTINIES (問六趣)

**初三行問六趣，驗此頌，知上文光照東方是總照他土意也，此頌頌上總問。**

**First, three lines ask about the Six Destinies. Examining this verse, we know that the text above "Light Illuminating all in the East" had the intent of Generally Illuminating Other Lands. This verse praises [recounts] that General Question.**

**六趣眾生是能趣之人，生死是所趣之處，善惡業緣是趣因，好醜是趣果也。**

**"Sentient beings of Six Destinies" are the **Persons Who Go** (*Néng Qù*). "Birth and Death" is the **Place Gone To** (*Suǒ Qù*). "Good and Evil Karma Conditions" are the **Causes of Going** (*Qù Yīn*). "Beautiful and Ugly" are the **Results of Going** (*Qù Guǒ*).**

---

### 2. SEEING BUDDHAS & DHARMA (問見佛說法)

**從「又覩諸佛」下，第二四行問見彼佛土，直見佛說法，此廣明說法之相，謂說頓教逗大根性，聖主師子即如此土現盧舍那像也。**

**From "Also seeing the Buddhas" downwards, the second part (4 lines) asks about Seeing those Buddha Lands and directly Seeing the Buddhas Expound Dharma. This broadly clarifies the marks of expounding Dharma, meaning expounding the **Sudden Teaching** (*Dùn Jiào*) to meet the **Great Root Nature** (*Dà Gēn Xìng*). "Sage Lord Lions" is like **This Land** manifesting the image of **Vairocana** (*Lúshěnuó*)[^3].**

**「演說經法微妙第一」者，即如此土先照高山演華嚴教也。**

**"Expounding Sutra Dharmas, subtle, wondrous, and foremost" is like **This Land** first illuminating the High Mountains and expounding the *Avataṃsaka* Teaching.**

**「教諸菩薩」者，即如此土七處等會，無聲聞人也。**

**"Teaching various Bodhisattvas" is like **This Land**'s[^4] **Seven Locations and Nine Assemblies** (*Qī Chù Jiǔ Huì*), where there are no Śrāvaka people.**
**「照明佛法，開悟眾生」者，即如此土始見佛身，入如來慧也。**

**"Illuminating Buddha Dharmas, opening and awakening sentient beings" is like **This Land** beginning to see the Buddha Body and entering the Tathāgata Wisdom.**

---

### [3. ASKING ABOUT FOUR ASSEMBLIES] (第三三行問彼土四眾)

**「若人遭苦」下，第三三行問彼土四眾，即是頓說之後，次明三藏教也。**

**From "If persons encounter suffering" downwards, the third part (3 lines) asks about the Four Assemblies of That Land. This is after the Sudden Preaching, next clarifying the **Tripiṭaka Teaching** (*Sānzàng Jiào*).**

**「若人遭苦」者，開聲聞乘也，此頌具明四諦，在文分明(云云)。**

**"If persons encounter suffering" opens the **Śrāvaka Vehicle**. This verse fully clarifies the Four Noble Truths; it is clear in the text.**

**若人遭苦而造惡業，苦不得盡，底下眾生是也；若人遭苦而造善業，苦亦不盡，厭下攀上，如難陀為欲故持戒等是也；**

**If persons encounter suffering and create evil karma, suffering cannot be exhausted—these are the "Bottom" sentient beings. If persons encounter suffering and create good karma, suffering is also not exhausted; they loathe the lower and climb to the higher [heavens], like Nanda holding precepts for the sake of desire.**

**若人遭苦，於外道法中求解脫，增見長非者，苦亦不盡；**

**If persons encounter suffering and seek liberation in **Outer Path** (*Tīrthika*) dharmas, increasing views and growing errors, suffering is also not exhausted.**

**若人遭苦厭集，復厭依果，感佛說涅槃者，此人能盡諸苦際也。他土亦開此乘也。**

**If persons encounter suffering and **Loathe Arising** (*Yàn Jí* - Second Truth), and further loathe the Dependent Result [Body], moving the Buddha to speak of Nirvana—this person can "Exhaust the boundaries of all suffering." Other Lands also open this Vehicle.**

**「若人有福」下一行，是開中乘也...**

**From "If persons have blessings" downwards (1 line) opens the **Middle Vehicle** [Pratyekabuddha]...**

**「志求勝法」者... 即是他土開中乘也。**

**"Intent on seeking Superior Dharma"... this is Other Lands opening the Middle Vehicle.**

**「若有佛子」下，是開六度大乘也，真慈悲能紹佛種故言佛子...**

**From "If there are Buddha Sons" downwards, opens the **Six Pāramitā Mahāyāna**. True Kindness and Compassion can continue the Buddha Seed, thus called "Buddha Sons"...**

---

### 4. CONCLUDING & OPENING (結前開後)

**「文殊我住」下，第四有一行半結前開後。「見聞若斯」，即是結前，「如是眾多」，即是開後。**

**From "Manjuśrī, I abide/see" downwards, the fourth part (1.5 lines) concludes the previous and opens the subsequent. "Seeing and hearing like this" concludes the previous. "Thus vast and many" opens the subsequent.**

---

### 5. BODHISATTVA PRACTICES (問菩薩行)

**就此為三：初、一行總問，次、十五行次第問，次、十五行半雜問。**

**Regarding this [Part 5: 31.5 lines], there are three parts: 1. One line of General Questioning; 2. Fifteen lines of **Sequential Questioning**; 3. Fifteen and a half lines of **Mixed Questioning**.**

**初總問可解。「或有行施」下，第二有十五行次第問，中為六：初、六行問檀，二、二行問尸，三、一行問忍，四、一行問進，五、二行問禪，六、三行問慧。**

**The initial General Question is understandable. From "Some perform giving (*Dāna*)" downwards, the second part (15 lines of Sequential Questioning) has six sections: 1. Six lines ask Dāna (Giving); 2. Two lines ask Śīla (Precepts); 3. One line asks Kṣānti (Patience); 4. One line asks Vīrya (Exertion); 5. Two lines ask Dhyāna (Meditation); 6. Three lines ask Prajñā (Wisdom).**

### [SEQUENTIAL QUESTIONING: THE SIX PĀRAMITĀS] (次第問)

**就問檀有三意：初四行問捨財，一行問捨身，一行問捨命。**

**Regarding Asking Dāna (Giving), there are three meanings: 1. First 4 lines ask Giving Wealth; 2. One line asks Giving Body; 3. One line asks Giving Life.**

**珍寶奴婢，貴賤共能此施；駟馬寶車，豪俠者所施；妻子等是外身，身肉等是內身，捨頭目即捨命。**

**Jewels and slaves—both noble and base can perform this giving. Four-horse chariots—only the heroic/wealthy give these. Wife and children are the **External Body**. Body and flesh are the **Internal Body**. Giving head and eyes is **Giving Life**.**

**而不言法施者，讓後般若也。又約身、命、財與生死後際等得不壞常住，即是法施，故不別說也。**

**Why not mention **Dharma Giving**? It defers to **Prajñā** [later]. Also, giving body, life, and wealth to equal the Latter Edge of Birth and Death (*Shengsi Houji*) and obtain the Indestructible Abiding—this *is* Dharma Giving, so it is not explained separately.**

---

**「文殊師利見王」下，第二二行問戒。約比丘論持戒者，在家施易戒難，出家施難戒易，故約比丘明戒，此中引《五王經》(云云)。**

**From "Manjuśrī sees Kings..." downwards, the second part (2 lines) asks about **Śīla** (Precepts). Discussing precept-holding regarding **Bhikṣus**: For Laypeople, Giving is easy but Precepts are hard; for Monastics, Giving is hard but Precepts are easy. Thus, it clarifies Precepts regarding Bhikṣus. Here it cites the *Sutra of Five Kings* (*Wǔ Wáng Jīng*).**

---

**「或見菩薩」下，第三一行問忍。忍有三種：閑林邃谷，惡人惡獸，忍耐無瞋即生忍；自節守志即苦行忍；為求佛道即第一義忍。**

**From "Or seeing Bodhisattvas..." downwards, the third part (1 line) asks about **Kṣānti** (Patience). Patience has three kinds:**
1.  **Life Patience** (*Shēng Rěn*): Enduring evil people and evil beasts in quiet forests and deep valleys without anger.
2.  **Ascetic Patience** (*Kǔxíng Rěn*): Self-regulation and guarding the will.
3.  **First Principle Patience** (*Dìyīyì Rěn*): Seeking the Buddha Way.[^5]

**又「而作比丘」即苦行忍，「獨處閑靜」即生忍，「樂誦經典」即第一義忍。**

**Also [in the verse]: "Acting as Bhikṣus" corresponds to Ascetic Patience. "Dwelling alone in quietude" corresponds to Life Patience. "Delighting in reciting Sutras" corresponds to First Principle Patience.**

---

**「又見菩薩勇」下，第四一行問精進者，夫深山可畏，非窳怯者所居，勇進者能安之，傍若無物，思修實相念念不休，進求佛道也。**

**From "Also seeing Bodhisattvas courageous..." downwards, the fourth part (1 line) asks about **Vīrya** (Exertion). Deep mountains are fearful; they are not places for the lazy or timid. The Courageous one can be at peace there, as if no one else exists, thinking and cultivating the **True Mark** (*Shíxiàng*) unceasingly thought after thought, advancing to seek the Buddha Way.**

---

**「又見離」下，第五兩行問禪，前一行問修根本禪，後一行問修出世上上禪，通途皆得有根本之修也。**

**From "Also seeing separation..." downwards, the fifth part (2 lines) asks about **Dhyāna** (Meditation). The first line asks about cultivating **Fundamental Dhyāna** (*Gēnběn Chán* - Four Dhyānas etc.). The latter line asks about cultivating **Out-of-World Highest Dhyāna** (*Chūshì Shàngshàng Chán*). In general, all paths involve fundamental cultivation.**

**離欲者，若離欲得五通，通教定也。又根本本離欲，背捨亦修不淨等離欲，別教兼離二乘欲，中道又離順道法愛欲(云云)。**

**"Separating from desire": If one separates from desire to obtain Five Superknowledges (*Abhijñā*), this is the Samādhi of the Common Teaching. Also, Fundamental Dhyāna separates from desire; Back-Discarding (*Bèishě* - Eight Liberations) also cultivates impurity to separate from desire. The Distinct Teaching additionally separates from Two Vehicle desires. The Middle Way further separates from the desire of Dharma-Love for the compliant path.**

**深修禪定者：初禪五支：先去五蓋，謂貪欲、瞋恚、睡眠、掉悔、疑。五支者：覺、觀、喜、樂、一心。二禪四支：內淨、喜、樂、一心。三禪五支：捨、念、慧、樂、一心。四禪四支：不苦不樂、捨、念、一心。此定轉變自在，能發諸通。**

**"Deeply cultivating Dhyana Suspension": First Dhyana has five branches (removing Five Covers: Desire, Anger, Sleep, Agitation, Doubt): Awareness (*Jué*), Observation (*Guān*), Joy (*Xǐ*), Bliss (*Lè*), One-Pointedness (*Yī Xīn*). Second Dhyana has four branches: Inner Purity (*Nèi Jìng*), Joy, Bliss, One-Pointedness. Third Dhyana has five branches: Equanimity (*Shě*), Mindfulness (*Niàn*), Wisdom (*Huì*), Bliss, One-Pointedness. Fourth Dhyana has four branches: Neither-Suffering-Nor-Bliss, Equanimity, Mindfulness, One-Pointedness. This Suspension transforms freely and can generate various penetrations (*Tōng*).**

**凡夫但五通，二乘具六，別教菩薩讓佛分有無漏，亦但稱五通也，圓教初後皆具六通。**

**Commoners have only Five Superknowledges. Two Vehicles possess Six. Distinct Teaching Bodhisattvas defer to the Buddha regarding "Outflows/No-Outflows," so they also claim only Five. The Perfect Teaching from beginning to end possesses Six.[^6]**

**「安禪萬偈」下，第二一行明上上禪，此是別、圓之禪，靜散不相妨，不起滅定現諸威儀，如修羅琴不拊而韻，無緣無念有感則形，故能安禪讚佛也。**

**From "Peaceful Dhyāna, ten thousand verses" downwards, the second line illuminates **Highest Dhyāna**. This is the Dhyāna of Distinct and Perfect Teachings. Quietude and Scattering do not obstruct each other. "Without arising from Extinction Samādhi, he manifests various dignities." Like the Asura's Harp playing without being strummed; without condition or thought, if there is a response, it takes form. Thus he can praise the Buddha while in Peaceful Dhyāna.**

---

**「復見智深」下，第六三行問般若，為二：初一行是自行，「智深」者，慧窮理本也；「志固」者，誓願廣大也，此即二種莊嚴，能問、能持也。**

**From "Also seeing Wisdom Deep" downwards, the sixth part (3 lines) asks about **Prajñā** (Wisdom). It has two parts: The first line is **Self-Practice**. "Wisdom Deep" means Wisdom exhausts the Root of Principle. "Will Firm" means Vows are vast and great. This is the **Two kinds of Adornment** (Wisdom & Merit); able to ask and able to hold.**

**「又見佛子定慧」下，次兩行是化他也，未到慧多，無色定多，四禪等。**

**From "Also seeing Buddha Sons, Samādhi and Wisdom..." downwards, the next two lines are **Transforming Others**. In Not-Yet-Arrived (*Wèi Dào*) Dhyāna, Wisdom is excessive. In Formless (*Wú Sè*) Dhyāna, Samādhi is excessive. In the Fourth Dhyāna, [Samādhi and Wisdom] are Equal.**

**「無量喻」即是種種方便，諸教之中引無量譬類，助顯第一義也。**

**"Immeasurable Similes" refers to various Skillful Means; in all teachings citing immeasurable analogies to assist in revealing the First Principle.**

**「破魔兵」者，空觀破四魔，假觀次第破八魔，中觀圓破八魔、十魔、一切魔。**

**"Breaking Mara's Army": The **Empty View** breaks 4 Maras. The **Provisional View** sequentially breaks 8 Maras. The **Middle View** perfectly breaks 8 Maras, 10 Maras, and All Maras.**

**「擊鼓」者，初發心住便成正覺，百佛世界作佛，圓擊梵輪法鼓。**
**"Beating the Drum": At the First Abode of Generating the Mind, one accomplishes True Awakening, becoming a Buddha in a hundred Buddha Worlds, perfectly beating the Brahma Wheel Dharma Drum.[^11]**

---

### [MIXED QUESTIONING] (雜問)

**從「又見菩薩寂然宴默」下，第三有十五行半，不歷次第隨見而問。**

**From "Also seeing Bodhisattvas silent and still" downwards, the third part (15.5 lines) is **Mixed Questioning**, asking according to what is seen without following a sequence.**

**就雜問中，文為七意：初二行問禪，又二，前一行問入捨禪，即是自行；次「又見菩薩放光」下，第二一行問入悲禪，初是化他。**

**Regarding Mixed Questioning, the text has seven meanings. 1. First 2 lines ask Dhyāna; this has two parts: The first line asks "Entering Renunciation Dhyāna" (*Rù Shě Chán*), which is **Self-Practice**. The next line "Also seeing Bodhisattvas emitting light" asks "Entering Compassion Dhyāna" (*Rù Bēi Chán*), which is **Transforming Others**.**

**菩薩入定、放光種種利益，具出《華嚴》、《思益》(云云)。**

**Detailed benefits of Bodhisattvas entering Samādhi and emitting light are set forth in the *Avataṃsaka* and *Viśeṣacintī-brahma-paripṛcchā Sūtra* (*Sīyì*)[^7].**

**次「又見佛子未甞」下，第二一行問精進，即是《般舟》念佛等法門也。**

**2.  Next, from "Also seeing Buddha Sons never sleeping" downwards (1 line) asks **Vīrya** (Exertion); this refers to Dharma Gates like the *Pratyutpanna* (*Bānzhōu*) Buddha-Recitation.**

**次「又見具戒」下，第三一行問戒，「威儀無缺」，即是初不缺戒，「淨如寶珠」，即是第十究竟戒，中間可解，十戒如《玄義》中說。**

**3.  Next, from "Also seeing those possessing precepts" downwards (1 line) asks **Śīla** (Precepts). "Dignity without lack" is the initial **Non-Lacking Precept**. "Pure like precious pearls" is the tenth **Ultimate Precept**. The middle ones can be understood; the Ten Precepts are explained in the *Xuányì* (*Profound Meaning*) [Fascicle 4].**

**次「又見佛子住忍」下，第四一行半問忍，即生、法二忍。**

**4.  Next, from "Also seeing Buddha Sons abiding in patience" downwards (1.5 lines) asks **Kṣānti** (Patience); this is the Two Patiences of Life and Dharma.**

**次「又見菩薩離戲」下，第五兩行更問禪，「離戲笑」是却掉悔蓋，離「癡眷屬」即除瞋蓋，「近智者」除疑蓋，「一心除亂」是却貪蓋，「攝念山林」除睡蓋。**

**5.  Next, from "Also seeing Bodhisattvas separating from play" downwards (2 lines) asks **Dhyāna** again. "Separating from play and laughter" removes the Cover of Restlessness and Regret. "Separating from foolish retinue" removes the Cover of Anger. "Near the wise" removes the Cover of Doubt. "One-mind removing confusion" removes the Cover of Greed. "Gathering thoughts in mountain forests" removes the Cover of Sleep. [Removing the Five Hindrances/Covers].**

**次從「或見菩薩」至「飲食」下，第六五行問檀，為二：前四行明四事施，「如是」下第二一行結成。**

**6.  Next, from "Some seeing Bodhisattvas" to "Drink and Food" downwards (5 lines) asks **Dāna** (Giving). It has two parts: The first 4 lines clarify giving the Four Requisites [clothing, food, bedding, medicine]. The line from "Thus..." downwards (1 line) concludes it.**

**次「或有菩薩說」下，第七有三行問般若，初一行不可說而說般若，二一行不可觀而觀般若，三一行言語道斷心行處滅，即是說不可說、觀不可觀而論般若也。**

**7.  Next, from "Some Bodhisattvas expound" downwards (3 lines) asks **Prajñā** (Wisdom). 1. The first line is "Speaking the Unspeakable Prajñā." 2. The second line is "Observing the Unobservable Prajñā." 3. The third line is "The Path of Words cut off, place of Mind's Action extinguished"—discussing Prajñā by speaking the unspeakable and observing the unobservable.**

**Although these are called "Mixed Questioning," generally the questions on giving and Dhyāna correspond to the meaning of the *Vaipulya* (*Fāng Děng*) Sutras. The questions on Prajñā correspond to the meaning of the *Great Perfection of Wisdom* (*Mahāprajñāpāramitā*).**

---

### [ASKING OFFERINGS TO RELICS] (問供養舍利)

**「文殊師利又有菩薩」下，第六有七行，明佛滅後以舍利起塔者，正頌上他土佛出五濁，從無相一法開漸、頓教，故有二法、三道種種行類相貌不同，如上所見也。**

**From "Manjuśrī, there are also Bodhisattvas" downwards, the sixth part (7 lines) clarifies raising Stupas for Relics after the Buddha's Extinction. This praises [recounts] the fact that the Buddha of that Land appeared in the Five Turbidities, opened Gradual and Sudden Teachings from the One Markless Dharma, hence there are Two Dharmas, Three Paths, and various different marks of practice as seen above.**

**今見他土佛般涅槃，佛子慕德為樹墳塔，即表無量悉歸入一、一出無量。**

**Now seeing the Buddha of That Land enter Parinirvāṇa, and Buddha Sons admiring his virtue by erecting Tomb-Stupas (*Fén Tǎ*), symbolizes **Immeasurable returning entering One** and **One producing Immeasurable**.**

**前相已表無量歸一，正是入於涅槃，云何畏妨壽量，作起塔為佛事耶？痛哉！痛哉！**

**The previous omens already symbolized "Immeasurable returning to One," which *is* entering Nirvana. Why fear that this obstructs the [Eternal] Life Span, and thus [avoid] treating "Raising Stupas" as a Buddha Work? Painful! Painful! [Referring to the Old Masters' error].**

**就文為六... (Detailed breakdown of 6 parts: 1. Raising Stupas; 2. Number; 3. Height; 4. Form; 5. Offerings; 6. Conclusion).**

**塔婆此云方墳，方墳如此土塚墓，《大灌頂》翻為塚也。殿堂如此土靈宇，崇臺峻階承露干雲，長表淨域歸心上聖耳。**

**"*Stūpa*" (*Tǎpó*) is translated here as **Square Tomb** (*Fāng Fén*). A Square Tomb is like a grave mound (*Zhǒng Mù*) in this land. The *Great Consecration Sutra* translates it as "Grave" (*Zhǒng*). "Palace Halls" are like spirit-shrines in this land... long symbolizing the Pure Limit and returning the heart to the Superior Sage.**

**樹王者即波利質多，正供舍利傍嚴佛國土。**

**"Tree King" is the **Pārijāta** (*Bōlìzhìduō*)[^8]. Strictly speaking, it offers to the Relics; incidentally, it adorns the Buddha Land.**

---

### [REQUEST FOR ANSWER & MANJUSHRI'S REPLY] (請答)

**從「佛放」下，第二有八行請答，為二：初三行舉疑事述請，後五行釋伏難。**

**From "The Buddha emits [light]..." downwards, the second part (8 lines) is **Requesting an Answer**. It has two parts: 1. First 3 lines raise the doubt and state the request; 2. Latter 5 lines explain **Latent Difficulties** (*Fú Nàn*).**

**初三行為三：初一行舉見此土事，白毫為本故先舉，及諸事故言「種種」；次「諸佛」下，第二一行舉見他土事，諸佛為本即總攝餘五也；「我等」下，第三一行請答。**

**The first 3 lines [of Request] have 3 parts: 1. Raises "Seeing This Land's matters"—White Hair-Mark is the root, thus raised first; "Variously" refers to other matters. 2. Raises "Seeing Other Lands' matters"—Buddhas are the root, encompassing the other five omens. 3. "We and others" asks for an answer.**

**第二就釋伏難為二：初四行正釋伏難，次一行結請。**

**The second part explaining **Latent Difficulties** (*Fú Nàn*)[^9] has two parts: 1. First 4 lines explain the difficulties; 2. Last line implies the request.**

**言伏難者，文殊內心搆難不肯時答，其意有三：一、此瑞希奇，不可倉卒輕爾有判；二、智眾如海謙光推高；三、靳固前却生眾渴仰，故以伏難潛而拒之。**

**"Latent Difficulties" means Manjuśrī internally constructs difficulties and is unwilling to answer immediately. His intent has three points: 1. This Omen is rare and strange; one cannot hastily judge it lightly. 2. The wise assembly is like an ocean; he modestly pushes high [defers to Buddha]. 3. Holding back to generate thirst/admiration in the assembly. Thus he uses Latent Difficulties to subtly refuse.**

**彌勒彰灼，釋難意亦有三：一、瑞大疑大，若不為釋，憂兕在懷妨聞正說；二、眾海乃多機在仁者；三、闔眾瞻仁，故知注誠殷重，所以彰言釋難，請令時答。**

**Maitreya is explicit/burning (*Zhāng Zhuó*); his intent in explaining the difficulties also has three points: 1. The Omen is Great, Doubt is Great; if not explained, the "Worried Rhinoceros" (*Yōu Sì*) in the chest will obstruct hearing the True Preaching. 2. Although the Ocean Assembly is many, the Catalyst is in the Benevolent One [Manjuśrī]. 3. The whole assembly looks to the Benevolent One, knowing their sincerity is heavy. Therefore he explicitly explains the difficulties and requests a timely answer.**

**初伏難者，因正請生，請云「佛子文殊願決眾疑」，文殊仍此起初伏難，汝云眾疑，眾未曾疑，若疑應問；眾既不疑，我何所決？**

**1.  **First Latent Difficulty:** Arises from the direct request. The request says "Buddha Son Manjuśrī, please resolve the assembly's doubts." Manjuśrī raises the first difficulty: "You say the assembly doubts? The assembly has not doubted. If they doubted, they would ask. Since they don't doubt, what is there for me to resolve?"**

**彌勒即以第一偈釋云「四眾欣仰瞻仁及我」。及我欲令我問，瞻仁欲得仁答。**

**Maitreya uses the first verse to explain: "The Four Assemblies look up to the Benevolent One and me." "And me" means they want me to ask; "Look up to Benevolent One" means they want you to answer.**

**文殊因此起第二難，眾同有疑，不易可答，待佛出定，然後決疑。**

**2.  **Second Difficulty:** Manjuśrī asks: "If the assembly collectively doubts, it is not easy to answer. Wait for the Buddha to exit Samādhi, then resolve the doubt."**

**彌勒即用第二偈釋，若有疑在，懷憂兕不泰，應以時答。復知如來何時起定，故言「佛子時答，決疑令喜」。**

**Maitreya uses the second verse to explain: "If doubt exists, holding the 'Worried Rhinoceros' is not peaceful. You should answer in time. Who knows when the Tathāgata will exit Samādhi?" Thus he says, "Buddha Son, answer in time; resolve doubts and cause delight."**

**文殊因此起第三難，我與仁者同居學地，欲測佛意微共籌量，獨令我答，於理不可。**

**3.  **Third Difficulty:** Manjuśrī asks: "I and the Benevolent One coexist in the Stage of Learning (*Śaikṣa*). We can consult together to fathom the Buddha's intent. To make *me alone* answer is unreasonable."**

**彌勒即以第三偈釋，我亦微心下思踟蹰兩楹，為說妙法？為當授記？故言「佛坐道場，所得妙法，為欲說此，為當授記。」**

**Maitreya uses the third verse to explain: "I also have a subtle mind and ponder, hesitating between two pillars (*Liǎng Yíng*): Is it to expound Wondrous Dharma? Or is it to bestow Prediction?" Thus he says: "Buddha sits in Bodhimanda, obtained Wondrous Dharma; is it desiring to speak this? Or bestow Prediction?"**

**文殊因此起第四難，若如汝說即是釋疑，何煩我答？**

**4.  **Fourth Difficulty:** Manjuśrī asks: "If it is as you say [prediction/preaching], that *is* explaining the doubt. Why bother me to answer?"**

**彌勒即以第四偈釋，安得以我猶豫之心而判大事？故言「示諸佛土，此非小緣」。文殊伏難既窮，謙光亦止，後一偈結請答也。**

**Maitreya uses the fourth verse to explain: "How can my hesitant mind judge the Great Matter?" Thus he says: "Manifesting Buddha Lands, this is not a small condition." Manjuśrī's latent difficulties are exhausted, his modesty stops. The last verse concludes the Request to Answer.**

**昔化道已竟，顯本事彰，故言發大乘意；今未發迹猶言羅漢，至下文發本，即是菩薩，其義則同。**
**Ancient [context]: Transformation Way completed, manifesting the Root Matter clearly; thus says "Generated Mahāyāna Intent." Current [context]: Not yet revealed the Trace, still called Arhat. When reaching the text below revealing the Root, he is a Bodhisattva. The meaning is Same.**

**從「是時日月燈佛說大乘經」下，第二明曾與今同。**

**From "At that time Sun Moon Lamp Buddha preached the Great Vehicle Sutra" downwards, the second part clarifies **Past Same as "Now"** (*Céng Yǔ Jīn Tóng*).[^12]**

**昔佛自土六瑞悉與今同，次第如文。**

**Ancient Buddha's Own Land Six Omens are all same as Now; the sequence is as in the text.**

**昔佛他土六瑞，總云如今所見，則知昔佛他土六瑞亦與今同；**

**Ancient Buddha's Other Land Six Omens are summarized as "Like what is seen now"; thus we know Ancient Buddha's Other Land Six Omens are also same as Now.**

**昔明別序，既有現相、懷疑二序同，而無集眾、發問、答問三序者，義推則有，**

**Ancient text clarified the Specific Preface. Since it has "Manifesting Omens" and "Harboring Doubts"—these two Prefaces are Same. But "Gathering Assembly," "Asking Questions," and "Answering Questions"—these three Prefaces [seem absent]. Inferring from meaning, they exist.**

**既言說法知必集眾，既道懷疑知應有問，若問必答，例二必兼，得三序同也。**

**Since it speaks of "Expounding Dharma," we know the Assembly must Gather. Since it speaks of "Harboring Doubt," we know there must be Questioning. If there is Questioning, there must be Answering. Applying the example of two, the [other] three must be included. Thus Three Prefaces are Same.**

**又若述昔答，則不俟文殊費辭，既不言答亦不出問，其義可解。**

**Also, if it narrated the Ancient Answer, it would not wait for Manjuśrī to waste words [now]. Since it does not state the Answer nor produce the Question, the meaning can be understood.**

## 14. MANJUSHRI'S ANSWER (文殊答)

### [D. PRESENT SAME AS "WILL BE"] (明曾與當同)

**從「時有菩薩名曰妙光」下，第三，明曾與當同。**

**From "At that time there was a Bodhisattva named **Wonderfully Bright** (*Miào Guāng*)[^14] downwards, the third part clarifies **Past Same as "Will Be"** (*Céng Yǔ Dāng Tóng*).**

**此文為六：一、從「時有菩薩」者，是因人同；二、從「爾時日月燈明佛從三昧起」者，是說法名同；**

**This text has six parts:**
1. **From "At that time there was a Bodhisattva": **Depending Person Same** (*Yīn Rén Tóng*).**
2. **From "At that time Sun Moon Lamp Bright Buddha rose from Samādhi": **Preaching Name Same**.**

**三、從「六十小劫」者，是時節同；四、從「說是經已於梵魔沙門」者，是唱滅同；**

3. **From "Sixty Small Kalpas": **Time Period Same**.**
4. **From "Having preached this Sutra... amidst Brahma, Maras, Shramanas": **Announcing Extinction Same**.**

**五、從「時有菩薩名曰德藏」者，是授記同；六、從「便於中夜」者，明滅後通經同。**

5. **From "At that time there was a Bodhisattva named Virtue Store": **Bestowing Prediction Same**.**
6. **From "Then at midnight": Clarifies **Post-Extinction Passing Sutra Same** (*Tōng Jīng Tóng*).**

#### [1. DEPENDING PERSON SAME] (因人同)

**今初，云何因人同？昔佛定起，因妙光菩薩說經，今佛定起，因身子聲聞說經，此云何同？**

**Now the first: How is "Depending Person" Same? Ancient Buddha rose from Samādhi and, depending on Wonderfully Bright Bodhisattva, preached the Sutra. Current Buddha rose from Samādhi and, depending on **Śāriputra** (*Shēnzǐ*) the Śrāvaka, preached the Sutra. How is this Same?**

**瑤師云：「因者因託，付傳一乘之經，非直對告之人也。」**

**Master Yáo[^10] says: "Depending (*Yīn*) means Depending/Entrusting (*Yīn Tuō*); entrusting the transmission of the One Vehicle Sutra, not merely the person addressed directly."**

**彼佛對告何必是妙光？如今對告身子，身子未必能有宣通，因託宣通莫若妙光，如今因委莫若文殊，今佛不歎者，往佛何必歎也？**

**That Buddha's direct address—why must it be Wonderfully Bright? Like now addressing Śāriputra; Śāriputra is not necessarily capable of propagating/transmitting. Depending/Entrusting propagation is none other than Wonderfully Bright; like now Entrusting is none other than Manjuśrī. If Current Buddha does not praise [Manjuśrī], why must Ancient Buddha praise [Wonderfully Bright]?**

**文殊引往佛歎妙光者，正明可因託耳。**

**Manjuśrī citing Ancient Buddha praising Wonderfully Bright correctly clarifies that he *can* be relied upon/entrusted.**

**又舊以藥王為所因人者，亦可爾，但引往證今，小不類耳。**

**Also, old interpretations take **Medicine King** (*Yàowáng*) as the person relied upon. This is also permissible, but citing Past to verify Present, it slightly doesn't match categories.**

**或言，因文殊釋疑，得起定說經，此對不便。今明不爾，經文自云因妙光正說，而作因託流通之解，**

**Some say: Because Manjuśrī resolved doubts, [Buddha] got to rise from Samādhi and preach. This correspondence is inconvenient. Now I clarify it is not so. The Sutra text itself says "Depending on Wonderfully Bright to Preach Correctly" (*Zhèng Shuō*). Yet they create an interpretation of "Depending/Entrusting for Propagation" (*Liú Tōng*).**

**又取藥王為例，此乃公抗佛語，何關釋經？**

**Also taking Medicine King as an example—this is publicly resisting the Buddha's words! How does this concern explaining the Sutra?**

**昔因妙光、今因身子，正是所因人同。**

**Anciently depending on Wonderfully Bright, Now depending on Śāriputra—this is precisely **Depending Person Same**.**

**昔佛八子師於妙光，如來起定對告妙光，又付託妙光；今佛子羅云亦師身子，佛從定起亦對告身子，**

**Ancient Buddha's Eight Sons took Wonderfully Bright as Master; Tathāgata rose from Samādhi and addressed Wonderfully Bright, and entrusted Wonderfully Bright. Current Buddha's Son Rāhula also takes Śāriputra as Master; Buddha rises from Samādhi and also addresses Śāriputra.**

**迹門竟又付託身子，今古孱齊更若為勝此，而近棄身子遠取藥王？**

**After the **Trace Gate** concludes, He also entrusts Śāriputra [in *Transmission* chapter?]. Present and Ancient are equal/level (*Chán Qí*); how could there be anything surpassing this? Why closely abandon Śāriputra and distantly take Medicine King?**

**疑者言：「妙光是菩薩，身子是聲聞，云何是同？」**

**Doubter says: "Wonderfully Bright is a Bodhisattva. Śāriputra is a Śrāvaka. How are they Same?"**

**昔事已彰譚為菩薩，今事未發道是聲聞，比及發迹，身子是大菩薩，非同何謂？**

**Ancient matters are already manifest, so he is discussed as Bodhisattva. Current matters are not yet revealed, so he is said to be Śrāvaka. Wait until the **Trace is Revealed** (*Fā Jī*): Śāriputra is a Great Bodhisattva. If not Same, what is it?**

**昔妙光垂迹，何必不作聲聞？特是文殊巧說，方便隱顯耳。**

**When Ancient Wonderfully Bright manifested Traces, why must he *not* have acted as a Śrāvaka? It is specially Manjuśrī's skillful speech, employing Skillful Means to **Hide and Reveal** (*Yǐn Xiǎn*).**

#### [2. PREACHING NAME SAME] (說法名同)

**從「是時日月」下，第二、說法名同者，如文。**

**From "At that time Sun Moon" downwards, the second part "Preaching Name Same" is as in text.**

**上彌勒見他土初頓，頓後見漸，漸後見種種行，行後無境，後見佛涅槃；**

**Above, Maitreya saw Other Lands: First **Sudden**; after Sudden seeing **Gradual**; after Gradual seeing **Various Practices**; after Practices seeing no [further] object, then seeing Buddha enter **Nirvana**.**

**今文殊答曾見佛初，頓頓後漸，後云種種行，即見《法華》。**

**Now Manjuśrī answers Past Seeing Buddha: First **Sudden**; after Sudden, **Gradual**; afterwards saying "Various Practices" *is* seeing the *Lotus Sutra*.**

**此彼六瑞之後已說《法華》，《法華》後即入涅槃，此分明定答他土之問也。**

**This and That [Land], after Six Omens, already preached *Lotus Sutra*. After *Lotus*, immediately entered Nirvana. This clearly and definitely answers the Question of Other Lands.**

#### [3. TIME PERIOD SAME] (時節同)

**從「六十小」下，第三、時節同者，如下文云：「五十小劫謂如半日」，即是同也。**

**From "Sixty Small [Kalpas]" downwards, the third part "Time Period Same": As the text below says "Fifty Small Kalpas were perceived as half a day." This is Same.**

#### [4. ANNOUNCING EXTINCTION SAME] (唱滅同)

**從「日月燈明」下，第四、唱滅同者，昔說《法華》即唱入滅，亦如迦葉佛(云云)。**

**From "Sun Moon Lamp Bright" downwards, the fourth part "Announcing Extinction Same": Anciently preaching *Lotus* then immediately announcing entry into Extinction; also like Kāśyapa Buddha.**

**今佛說〈寶塔品〉中，明如來不久當入涅槃，化道已足，唱滅事齊也。**

**Current Buddha, in the *Jeweled Stupa Chapter*, clarifies the Tathāgata will soon enter Nirvana. Transformation Way is sufficient. The matter of Announcing Extinction is equal/aligned.**

#### [5. BESTOWING PREDICTION SAME] (授記同)

**「時有菩薩」下，第五、授記同者，昔授德藏菩薩記，今經授聲聞記，豈得是同？**

**From "At that time there was a Bodhisattva" downwards, the fifth part "Bestowing Prediction Same." Anciently bestowed prediction on **Virtue Store** (*Dé Zàng*) Bodhisattva. Current Sutra bestows prediction on Śrāvakas. How can this be Same?**

**昔事已成故言授菩薩記，然正是會三歸一，聲聞得記也。**

**Ancient matter is already accomplished, so it says "Bestowed Bodhisattva Prediction." However, it was precisely **Uniting Three to Return to One**, where Śrāvakas received prediction.**

**若說昔授聲聞記者，佛從定起，更何所論？文殊巧譚故不發迹耳。**

**If he said "Anciently bestowed Śrāvaka Prediction," [then when] Buddha rises from Samādhi [now], what more would be discussed? [The surprise would be spoiled]. Manjuśrī speaks skillfully, therefore does not reveal the Trace [of Śāriputra].**

**若說授菩薩記，諸經皆爾，執教者未驚也(云云)。**

**If he says "Bestowed Bodhisattva Prediction," all Sutras are like this; those attached to Teaching would not be surprised.**

#### [6. PASSING SUTRA SAME] (通經同)

**從「佛授記已」下，第六、通經同。文為五：一、時節，即佛滅後也；二、出其人，即妙光也；**

**From "Buddha having bestowed prediction" downwards, the sixth part "Passing Sutra Same." Text has five parts:**
1. **Time Period: After Buddha's Extinction.**
2. **Producing the Person: Wonderfully Bright.**

**三、久近，即八十小劫也；四、所化之眾，即八子八百也；五、結會古今，即求名妙德等也。**

3. **Duration (*Jiǔ Jìn*): Eighty Small Kalpas.**
4. **Assembly Transformed: Eight Sons and Eight Hundred [Disciples].**
5. **Concluding/Uniting Ancient and Present: "Fame Seeker," "Wonderfully Virtuous" etc.**

**就所化之人又為二：初、八子行成久已得佛，八百之一方成今住補處。**

**Regarding the Transformed People, there are two:**
1. **Eight Sons' practice accomplished, long ago attained Buddhahood.**
2. **One of the Eight Hundred just accomplished, now abides in **Designated Succession** (*Bǔ Chù* - Maitreya).**

**所以引此八子八百者，近則釋疑密開壽量。**

**The reason for citing Eight Sons and Eight Hundred: **Near** purpose is resolving doubt; **Secret** purpose is Opening the Life Span.**

**釋疑者，或謂彌勒補處為大，文殊非補處為小，小不應答，大不應問，**

**Resolving Doubt:** Some might say Maitreya (Successor) is Great; Manjuśrī (Non-Successor) is Small. Small should not Answer; Great should not Ask.**

**故舉八百，宜應有問，妙光昔親對佛，先復為師，故釋疑非謬。**

**Therefore raising the "Eight Hundred" [including Maitreya]: It is suitable he should Ask. Wonderfully Bright anciently personally faced the Buddha and was teacher to the predecessors. Thus resolving doubt is not erroneous.**

**密開壽量者，八子最小佛號然燈，然燈是定光，妙光是釋迦九世祖師，**

**Secretly Opening Life Span:** The youngest of Eight Sons was Buddha named **Dīpaṃkara** (*Rán Dēng*). Dīpaṃkara is "Fixed Light" (*Dìng Guāng*). Wonderfully Bright is Śākyamuni's Ninth Generation Ancestral Teacher.**

**孫今成佛，師、祖為弟子，師弟無定，將密顯生非生、滅非滅之意。**

**The Grandson [Śākyamuni] now becomes Buddha; the Teacher/Ancestor [Manjuśrī] becomes Disciple [of Śākyamuni]. Teacher and Disciple are not fixed. This intends to secretly reveal **Birth is Non-Birth, Extinction is Non-Extinction**.**

**問：彌勒昔見諸佛，曾聞《法華》，何故疑問？**

**Question:** Maitreya anciently saw all Buddhas and already heard the *Lotus*. Why does he doubt and ask?**

**答：時眾機宜應須扣發耳。**

**Answer:** The Capacity (*Jī*) of the current Assembly required knocking/activation (*Kòu Fā*).**

### [4. CLEARLY JUDGING ANSWER] (分明判答)

**第四、從「今見此瑞」下，名分明判答。**

**Fourth, from "Now seeing this omen" downwards, is called **Clearly Judging Answer**.**

**今昔六瑞既同，惟忖決定不謬，略曾、廣曾，皆決定也。**

**Since Ancient and Current Six Omens are Same[^13], the **Thinking Answer** is definitely not erroneous; **Brief Past** and **Broad Past** are all Definite/Decided.**

**「當說大乘」，決定前說法瑞也；「名妙法蓮華」，決定前雨花瑞也；**

**"Will preach Great Vehicle": Decides the previous Omen of **Expounding Dharma**.**
**"Named Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower": Decides the previous Omen of **Raining Flowers**.**

**「教菩薩法」，決定前眾喜瑞也；「佛所護念」，決定前地動瑞也。**

**"Teaching Bodhisattva Dharmas": Decides the previous Omen of **Assembly Rejoicing**.**
**"Buddha supposedly protects/mindfulness" (*Fó Suǒ Hù Niàn*): Decides the previous Omen of **Earth Shaking**.**

**兼總入定悉在其中，有人作已同當同，不作今同。**

**Simultaneously, the general "Entering Samādhi" is entirely within it. Some people make "Already Same" and "Will Be Same," but do not make "Now Same" (*Jīn Tóng*).**

**尋文云：「今見此瑞與本無異」，此正語於今，云何喚六瑞作已？據此文為今，故作三同之釋也。**

**Seeking the text "Now seeing this omen is no different from the Root": This correctly speaks of **Now**. How can one call Six Omens "Already"? Based on this text being "Now," I make the interpretation of **Three Sames** [Past, Now, Future].**

### [MANJUSHRI'S VERSES] (頌)

**頌有四十五行偈，為三：初一行頌序即惟忖答；**

**The Verses have forty-five lines. There are three parts:**
1. **First line praises the **Preface**; this is the **Thinking Answer** (*Wéi Cǔn Dá*).**

**Also, we can bundle these three into two: First line praises "Thinking"; latter forty-four lines praise "Decided/Definite."**

**言「我惟」者，此是文殊自惟，非更惟忖昔日也。**

**Saying "I think" (*Wǒ Wéi*): This is Manjuśrī "Thinking" *himself* [now]; not further "Thinking/Measuring the Past Days."**

**「睹此亦復然」者，頌上略曾見同，「略」中唯頌放光，下廣中亦兼頌放光。**

**今偈便故先三乘後頓，無別意也。**

**Now the Verses, for convenience, put Three Vehicles first and Sudden after. There is no other special meaning.**

**Fascicle 3 Part 1:** Covers the commentary on the latter half of the "Introduction Chapter" of the *Lotus Sutra*, focusing on the Q&A between Maitreya and Manjuśrī.

[^1]: **62 Lines:** Refers to the Chinese verse structure (4 characters/lines per stanza).

[^2]: **Vibhāṣā/Da Zhi Du Lun:** (*Pí Pó Shā*) Traditionally attributed to the *Mahāvibhāṣā Śāstra*, but often refers to the *Dà Zhì Dù Lùn* (T1509) in Zhiyi’s usage when discussing Mahāyāna concepts. Scholarly consensus varies on specific attributions without direct citation.

[^3]: **Vairocana (*Lúshěnuó*):** The "Reward Body" (*Sambhogakāya*) Buddha. In Tiantai, Vairocana represents the glorious, ubiquitous body of the Buddha formed by merits, distinct from the physical *Śākyamuni* (*Nirmāṇakāya*) and the abstract Principle *Birushana* (*Dharmakāya*).

[^4]: **Seven Locations and Nine Assemblies:** The traditional structure of the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*, where the Buddha (as Vairocana) preaches in seven different locations (Bodhimanda, Universal Light Hall, Trayastriṃśa Heaven, etc.) over nine assemblies.

[^5]: **First Principle Patience:** *Paramārtha-kṣānti*. The highest patience, which endures the non-arising of dharmas (*Anutpattika-dharma-kṣānti*) and seeks the ultimate Buddha Way, transcending mere endurance of suffering.

[^6]: **Five vs. Six Superknowledges:** The Six *Abhijñā* are: 1. Divine Eye, 2. Divine Ear, 3. Knowledge of Others' Minds, 4. Past Lives, 5. Psychic Travel, 6. Extinction of Outflows (*Āsravakṣaya*). Ordinary beings and lesser Bodhisattvas lack the 6th (Extinction of Outflows); therefore, they are said to have only Five. The Perfect Bodhisattva possesses all Six.

[^7]: **Sīyì:** *Viśeṣacintī-brahma-paripṛcchā Sūtra* (Sutra of the Questions of Excellent Thought Brahma), translated by Kumārajīva. It is a key Vaipulya text discussing the non-duality of the Bodhisattva path.

[^8]: **Pārijāta:** The "Coral Tree" or "Tree of Heaven," growing in the Trayastriṃśa Heaven. Its fragrance perfumes the entire heaven, symbolizing the pervasive power of merit.

[^9]: **Latent Difficulties (*Fú Nàn*):** An exegetical device where the commentator assumes an unasked question or hidden doubt ("Difficulty") lies behind the text's surface structure. The transmission from **Master Zhao of Jiangbei** to **Guangzhai Fayun** shows this was an established method in the Southern traditions before Zhiyi.

[^10]: **Master Yáo:** Likely referring to **Sengyou** or **Daoyou**, prominent exegetes of the Nirvana/Satysiddhi tradition who emphasized the "Depending/Entrusting" meaning of *Yīn*.

[^11]: **First Abode / Breaking Ignorance:** Corresponds to the **Six Stages of Identity** (*Liù Jí Fó*). At each stage (Reason, Name, Practice, Semblance, True Fraction, Ultimate), a layer of Ignorance is broken. The "First Abode" corresponds to the Stage of True Fraction (*Fēn Zhèng Jí*), where one starts to break fundamental Ignorance and reveal the Dharma Body.

[^12]: **Sun Moon Lamp Bright:** Sanskrit **Candrasūryapradīpa**. A past Buddha name symbolizing the Three Wisdoms: Sun (All-Knowledge/Compassion), Moon (Path Wisdom), Lamp (All-Modes Wisdom/Breaking Darkness).

[^13]: **Omen Correspondence:** Zhiyi here correlates the *Past* Omen of Raining Flowers with the *Present* Omen of **Expounding Dharma**, and the *Past* Earth Shaking with the *Present* **Assembly Rejoicing**. This differs from the direct "Flowers-to-Flowers" correspondence seen in the earlier "Thinking Answer," illustrating the fluidity of the Six Omens in the "Broad" view where all omens interpenetrate.

[^14]: **Wonderfully Bright (*Miào Guāng*):** Or *Varaprabha*. The past incarnation of **Manjuśrī**, showing his role as the teacher of past Buddhas, including Maitreya (Fame Seeker).
