## 13. MAITREYA'S VERSES

**從「爾時彌勒欲自決疑」下訖偈，即是發問序，文為二：長行、偈頌。**

**From "At that time Maitreya wished to resolve his doubts" down to the end of the verses, this is the **Preface of Asking Questions** (*Fā Wèn Xù*). The text has two parts: Prose and Verses.[^15]**
*[Critical apparatus: 不分卷【甲】]*


---

**長行中經家述自疑、他疑發問。**

**In the Prose, the Sutra Compiler narrates the self-doubt and other-doubt to initiate the questioning.**

---

**問中此土、他土如文，何意有偈頌耶？**

**In the questioning,[^16] [the doubts regarding] This Land and That Land are as in the text. Why is there a Verse Section (*Gāthā*)?**
*[Critical apparatus: 問【大】，〔－〕【甲】]*


---

**龍樹《毘婆沙》云：**

**Nāgārjuna's *[Mahā]vibhāṣā [Śāstra]*[^2] says:**

**「一、隨國土天竺有散花、貫花之說，如此間序、後銘也；**

**1.  **According to the Country:** India (*Tiānzhú*) has the convention of 'Scattered Flowers' (Prose) and 'Strung Flowers' (Verse); this is like the 'Preface' (*Xù*) and 'Post-Inscription' (*Míng*) in this land [China].**

**二、隨樂欲不同，有樂散說，或樂章句；**

**2.  **According to Delight/Desire:** [Beings] differ; some delight in scattering exposition (Prose), some delight in stanzas (Verse).**

**三、隨生解不同，或於散說得解，或於章句得解；**

**3.  **According to Arising of Understanding:** Some obtain understanding from prose, some obtain understanding from stanzas.**

**四、隨利鈍，利者一聞即悟，鈍者再說方悟。」**

**4.  **According to Sharp and Dull:** The Sharp one awakens upon one hearing; the Dull one awakens only after it is said again.**

---

**又表佛殷勤重說，又為眾集前後故有偈也。**

**Also, it symbolizes the Buddha's **Solicitous Repetition** (*Yīnqín Chóngshuō*) [earnestness]. Also, there are verses for the sake of the assembly gathering early or late [so latecomers hear the teaching].**

---

**偈有六十二行，文為兩：初五十四行頌上問，後八行請答。**

**The Verses have sixty-two lines [stanzas]. The text has two parts: The first fifty-four lines recount the **Questions** above; the latter eight lines **Request an Answer**.[^1]**



---

**就問為兩：前四行，問此土；後五十行，問他土。**

**Regarding the **Questioning**,[^17] there are two[^18] parts: The first four lines ask about **This Land**; the latter fifty lines ask about **That [Other] Land**.**
*[Critical apparatus: 問【大】，答問【甲】; 兩【大】，二【甲】]*


---

**長行總問此土六瑞，偈中長有香風地淨，無說法入定。觀文謂言盈縮，尋義不然。**

**The Prose generally asks about the Six Omens of This Land. The Verses extend [add] "Fragrant Wind" and "Ground Purification," but lack "Expounding Dharma" and "Entering Samādhi." Looking at the text, one might call this **Existing/Shrinking** (*Yíng Suō* - Adding/Subtracting). Seeking the meaning, it is not so.**

---

**說法是慧性，入定是天心，由天心慧性，能作動地放光，舉末即能知本故，縮非縮也。**

**"Expounding Dharma" is **Wisdom Nature** (*Huì Xìng*). "Entering Samādhi" is **Heavenly Mind** (*Tiān Xīn*). Because of Heavenly Mind and Wisdom Nature, one can create Earth Shaking and Light Emission. Raising the Branch [Omen] enables knowing the Root [Samādhi/Wisdom]; thus, "Shrinking" is **Not Shrinking** (*Suō Fēi Suō*).**

---

**他不見此意，謂彌勒不問兩事，便不以為瑞。今反難之，若彌勒不問，文殊何故而答？**

**Others [Old Masters like Fayun/Guangzhai] do not see this intent; they say Maitreya did not ask about these two matters [Dharma/Samādhi], so they are not Omens. Now I counter-question them: If Maitreya did not ask, why did Manjuśrī answer [about them]?**

---

**又，問指何處為問？今指長行，總問是也，若更顯其別問，秖導師兩字是也。**

**Also, if you ask "Where is the Question point?", I point to the Prose—the **General Question** is it. If we further reveal the **Specific Question**, it is simply in the two words **"Guide/Teacher"** (*Dǎoshī*).**

---

**良以說法、入定能導於人，既稱導師，即是問說法、入定也，是故非縮。**

**Ideally, Expounding Dharma and Entering Samādhi can **Guide** people. Since he is called "Guide," this *is* asking about Expounding Dharma and Entering Samādhi. Therefore, it is **Not Shrinking** (Omission).**

---

**他云：「風由檀林故香，地加之嚴淨，盈長兩事。」**

**Others say: "The wind is fragrant because of sandalwood groves; the earth is additionally adorned and purified. This is adding/lengthening two matters."**

**今謂非盈，風本無香而香，為奇特故以成瑞，夫天花至妙，豈有色而無香？**

**I say it is not an addition: the wind originally has no fragrance yet becomes fragrant. Because it is extraordinary, it becomes an omen. Since heavenly flowers are supremely wondrous, how could they have color yet have no fragrance?**

**此表因運至果，如花有香風，花既集地，地則嚴淨，因若趣果，果則嚴淨。**

**This indicates cause being conveyed to fruit: when the flowers have fragrant wind; once the flowers gather on the ground, the ground is adorned and purified. If the cause tends toward the fruit, the fruit is adorned and purified.**

**《金光明》云：「聚集功德莊嚴佛身。」**

**The *Golden Light Sutra* says: "Gathering merits adorns the Buddha-body."**

**故以二事顯成四花，盈非盈也。**

**Therefore, by these two matters [wind fragrance and ground purification], it manifests and completes the four flowers; "adding" is not adding.**

---

### [ASKING ABOUT OTHER LANDS]

**「眉間光」下，次有五十行，頌問他土六瑞，**

**From "Brow Light"[^19] downwards, next there are fifty lines [of verse] that versify the questions about the Six Omens of Other Lands.**
*[Critical apparatus: 光【大】，光明【甲】]*


**舊云：「頌中不問三乘四眾，不問佛涅槃。今教廢三，那忽問三？方說壽量，那問滅度？於義不便故不問也。」**

**Old [commentators] say: "In the verses, he does not ask about the Three Vehicles and Four Assemblies, and does not ask about the Buddha's Nirvana. Now this teaching abolishes the three; why suddenly ask about three? Now it is about to speak of Lifespan; why ask about extinction? It is inconvenient to the meaning, so he does not ask."**

**嗚呼！不解消文，抑經就情。**

**Alas! They do not understand how to make the text cohere, and they press the Sutra to fit their sentiments.**

**今明頌中具問他土六瑞，文為六：**

**Now I clarify: the verses fully ask about the Six Omens of Other Lands. The text has six [items]:**

**初、三行問六趣眾生；**

**First: three lines ask about sentient beings of the Six Destinies.**

**二、四行問見彼佛及說法；**

**Second: four lines ask about seeing those Buddhas and [their] expounding of Dharma.**

**三、三行問他土四眾；**

**Third: three lines ask about the Four Assemblies of Other Lands.**

**次、一行半結前開後；**

**Next: one and a half lines conclude what comes before and open what comes after.**

**次、三十一行半，問他土修菩薩行；**

**Next:[^20] thirty-one and a half lines ask about cultivating Bodhisattva practices in Other Lands.**
*[Critical apparatus: 次【大】，五【甲】]*


**次、七行問供養舍利，即是問佛涅槃也。**

**Next:[^21] seven lines ask about offerings to relics; this is precisely asking about the Buddha's Nirvana.**
*[Critical apparatus: 次【大】，六【甲】]*


---

### 1. SIX DESTINIES

**初三行問六趣，驗此頌，知上文光照東方是總照他土意也，此頌頌上總問。**

**First, three lines ask about the Six Destinies. Examining this verse, we know that the text above "Light Illuminating all in the East" had the intent of Generally Illuminating Other Lands. This verse praises [recounts] that General Question.**

**六趣眾生是能趣之人，生死是所趣之處，善惡業緣是趣因，好醜是趣果也。**

**"Sentient beings of Six Destinies" are the **Persons Who Go** (*Néng Qù*). "Birth and Death" is the **Place Gone To** (*Suǒ Qù*). "Good and Evil Karma Conditions" are the **Causes of Going** (*Qù Yīn*). "Beautiful and Ugly" are the **Results of Going** (*Qù Guǒ*).**

---

### 2. SEEING BUDDHAS & DHARMA

**從「又覩諸佛」下，第二四行問見彼佛土，直見佛說法，此廣明說法之相，謂說頓教逗大根性，聖主師子即如此土現盧舍那像也。**

**From "Also seeing the Buddhas" downwards, the second part (4 lines) asks about Seeing those Buddha Lands and directly Seeing the Buddhas Expound Dharma. This broadly clarifies the marks of expounding Dharma, meaning expounding the **Sudden Teaching** (*Dùn Jiào*) to meet the **Great Root Nature** (*Dà Gēn Xìng*). "Sage Lord Lions" is like **This Land** manifesting the image of **Vairocana** (*Lúshěnuó*)[^3].**
*[Critical apparatus: [9] 佛【大】，諸佛【甲】; [10] 生【大】，生者【甲】]*


**「演說經法微妙第一」者，即如此土先照高山演華嚴教也。**

**"Expounding Sutra Dharmas, subtle, wondrous, and foremost" is like **This Land** first illuminating the High Mountains and expounding the *Avataṃsaka* Teaching.**

**「教諸菩薩」者，即如此土七處等會，無聲聞人也。**

**"Teaching various Bodhisattvas" is like **This Land**'s[^4] **Seven Locations and Nine Assemblies** (*Qī Chù Jiǔ Huì*), where there are no Śrāvaka people.**
**「照明佛法，開悟眾生」者，即如此土始見佛身，入如來慧也。**

**"Illuminating Buddha Dharmas,[^22] opening and awakening sentient beings"[^23] is like **This Land** beginning to see the Buddha Body and entering the Tathāgata Wisdom.**
*[Critical apparatus: 佛【大】，諸佛【甲】; 生【大】，生者【甲】]*


---

### [3. ASKING ABOUT FOUR ASSEMBLIES]

**「若人遭苦」下，第三三行問彼土四眾，即是頓說之後，次明三藏教也。**

**From "If persons encounter suffering" downwards, the third part (3 lines) asks about the Four Assemblies of That Land. This is after the Sudden Preaching, next clarifying the **Tripiṭaka Teaching** (*Sānzàng Jiào*).**
*[Critical apparatus: [1] 人【大】，〔－〕【甲】; [2] 供【大】，供養【甲】; [3] 故【大】，佛故【甲】]*


**「若人遭苦」者，開聲聞乘也，此頌具明四諦，在文分明(云云)。**

**"If persons encounter suffering" opens the **Śrāvaka Vehicle**. This verse fully clarifies the Four Noble Truths; it is clear in the text.**

**若人遭苦而造惡業，苦不得盡，底下眾生是也；若人遭苦而造善業，苦亦不盡，厭下攀上，如難陀為欲故持戒等是也；**

**If persons encounter suffering and create evil karma, suffering cannot be exhausted—these are the "Bottom" sentient beings. If persons[^24] encounter suffering and create good karma, suffering is also not exhausted; they loathe the lower and climb to the higher [heavens], like Nanda holding precepts for the sake of desire.**
*[Critical apparatus: 人【大】，〔－〕【甲】]*


**若人遭苦，於外道法中求解脫，增見長非者，苦亦不盡；**

**If persons encounter suffering and seek liberation in **Outer Path** (*Tīrthika*) dharmas, increasing views and growing errors, suffering is also not exhausted.**

**若人遭苦厭集，復厭依果，感佛說涅槃者，此人能盡諸苦際也。他土亦開此乘也。**

**If persons encounter suffering and **Loathe Arising** (*Yàn Jí* - Second Truth), and further loathe the Dependent Result [Body], moving the Buddha to speak of Nirvana—this person can "Exhaust the boundaries of all suffering." Other Lands also open this Vehicle.**

**「若人有福」下一行，是開中乘也，若供養佛少，遭苦致惱；若供佛多，雖遭苦而福，故云聲聞三生種福，支佛百劫種福，形彼聲聞故言有福。**

**From "If a person has blessings"—the next single line—this opens the Middle Vehicle. If one makes few offerings to a Buddha, one encounters suffering and is afflicted. If one makes many[^25] offerings to a Buddha, although one encounters suffering one has blessings. Therefore it says: a śrāvaka plants blessings over three lifetimes; a pratyekabuddha plants blessings over a hundred kalpas. In comparison with those śrāvakas, therefore it says "has blessings."**
*[Critical apparatus: 供【大】，供養【甲】]*


**「志求勝法」者，聲聞厭苦而修行，支佛求道故修行，深求緣起勝妙之理，即是他土開中乘也。**

**As for "intent on seeking superior Dharma": śrāvakas cultivate practice because they loathe suffering; pratyekabuddhas cultivate practice because they seek the path. They deeply seek the superior and subtle principle of dependent arising—this is precisely the other land opening the Middle Vehicle.**

**「若有佛子」下，是開六度大乘也，真慈悲能紹佛種故言佛子，修於六度故言種種行，志求故言無上慧，六度中無六蔽，如藥中無病故言淨道，非畢竟淨也。**

**From "If there are Buddha-sons" downwards, this opens the Mahāyāna of the Six Pāramitās. True compassion can continue the Buddha-seed, therefore they are called "Buddha-sons." They cultivate the Six Pāramitās, therefore it says "various practices." Because they aspire and seek,[^26] therefore it says "unsurpassed wisdom." Within the Six Pāramitās there are no six hindrances; like medicine that contains no disease, therefore it is called the "pure path"—it is not ultimately pure.**
*[Critical apparatus: 故【大】，佛故【甲】]*


**又聲聞苦諦為觀門，緣覺集諦為門，六度菩薩道諦為門，故言淨道。**

**Further: for śrāvakas, the Truth of Suffering is the contemplation gate; for pratyekabuddhas, the Truth of Arising is the gate; for Six-Pāramitā bodhisattvas, the Truth of the Path is the gate. Therefore it is called the "pure path."**

---

### 4. CONCLUDING & OPENING

**「文殊[^27]我住」下，第四有[^28]一行半結前開後。「見聞若斯」，即是結前，「如是眾多」，即是開後。**

**From "Manjuśrī, I abide/see" downwards, the fourth part (1.5 lines) concludes the previous and opens the subsequent.[^27][^28] "Seeing and hearing like this" concludes the previous. "Thus vast and many" opens the subsequent.**

*[Critical apparatus: [4] 文殊【大】，次文殊師利【甲】; [5] 有【大】＊，〔－〕【甲】＊]*

---

### 5. BODHISATTVA PRACTICES

**「我見彼土」下，第五有三十一行半，問他土菩薩種種修行。**

**From "I see that land" downwards, the fifth part has thirty-one and a half lines, asking about the various practices cultivated by bodhisattvas in that other land.**
*[Critical apparatus: [6] 第【大】，〔－〕【甲】; [7] 目【大】，眼【甲】; [8] 一行【大】，〔－〕【甲】; [9] 也【大】，〔－〕【甲】]*


**就此為三：初、一行總問，次、十五行次第問，次、十五行半雜問。**

**Regarding this [Part 5: 31.5 lines], there are three parts: 1. One line of General Questioning; 2. Fifteen lines of **Sequential Questioning**; 3. Fifteen and a half lines of **Mixed Questioning**.**

**初總問可解。「或有行施」下，第[^29]二有十五行次第問，中為六：初、六行問檀，二、二行問尸，三、一行問忍，四、一行問進，五、二行問禪，六、三行問慧。**

**The initial General Question is understandable. From "Some perform giving (*Dāna*)" downwards, the second part (15 lines of Sequential Questioning) has six sections:[^29] 1. Six lines ask Dāna (Giving); 2. Two lines ask Śīla (Precepts); 3. One line asks Kṣānti (Patience); 4. One line asks Vīrya (Exertion); 5. Two lines ask Dhyāna (Meditation); 6. Three lines ask Prajñā (Wisdom).**

### [SEQUENTIAL QUESTIONING: THE SIX PĀRAMITĀS]

**就問檀有三意：初四行問捨財，一行問捨身，一行問捨命。**

**Regarding Asking Dāna (Giving), there are three meanings: 1. First 4 lines ask Giving Wealth; 2. One line asks Giving Body; 3. One line asks Giving Life.**

**珍寶奴婢，貴賤共能此施；駟馬寶車，豪俠者所施；妻子等是外身，身肉等是內身，捨頭目[^30]即捨命。**

**Jewels and slaves—both noble and base can perform this giving. Four-horse chariots—only the heroic/wealthy give these. Wife and children are the **External Body**. Body and flesh are the **Internal Body**. Giving head and eyes is **Giving Life**.[^30]**

**而不言法施者，讓後般若也。又約身、命、財與生死後際等得不壞常住，即是法施，故不別說也。**

**Why not mention **Dharma Giving**? It defers to **Prajñā** [later]. Also, giving body, life, and wealth to equal the Latter Edge of Birth and Death (*Shengsi Houji*) and obtain the Indestructible Abiding—this *is* Dharma Giving, so it is not explained separately.**

---

**「文殊師利見王」下，第二二行問戒。約比丘論持戒者，在家施易戒難，出家施難戒易，故約比丘明戒，此中引《五王經》(云云)。**

**From "Manjuśrī sees Kings..." downwards, the second part (2 lines) asks about **Śīla** (Precepts). Discussing precept-holding regarding **Bhikṣus**: For Laypeople, Giving is easy but Precepts are hard; for Monastics, Giving is hard but Precepts are easy. Thus, it clarifies Precepts regarding Bhikṣus. Here it cites the *Sutra of Five Kings* (*Wǔ Wáng Jīng*).**

---

**「或見菩薩」下，第三一行問忍。忍有三種：閑林邃谷，惡人惡獸，忍耐無瞋即生忍；自節守志即苦行忍；為求佛道即第一義忍。**

**From "Or seeing Bodhisattvas..." downwards, the third part (1 line) asks about **Kṣānti** (Patience). Patience has three kinds:**
1.  **Life Patience** (*Shēng Rěn*): Enduring evil people and evil beasts in quiet forests and deep valleys without anger.
2.  **Ascetic Patience** (*Kǔxíng Rěn*): Self-regulation and guarding the will.
3.  **First Principle Patience** (*Dìyīyì Rěn*): Seeking the Buddha Way.[^5]

**又「而作比丘」即苦行忍，「獨處閑靜」即生忍，「樂誦經典」即第一義忍。**

**Also [in the verse]: "Acting as Bhikṣus" corresponds to Ascetic Patience. "Dwelling alone in quietude" corresponds to Life Patience. "Delighting in reciting Sutras" corresponds to First Principle Patience.**

---

**「又見菩薩勇」下，第四一行問精進者，夫深山可畏，非窳怯者所居，勇進者能安之，傍若無物，思修實相念念不休，進求佛道也。**

**From "Also seeing Bodhisattvas courageous..." downwards, the fourth part (1 line) asks about **Vīrya** (Exertion). Deep mountains are fearful; they are not places for the lazy or timid. The Courageous one can be at peace there, as if no one else exists, thinking and cultivating the **True Mark** (*Shíxiàng*) unceasingly thought after thought, advancing to seek the Buddha Way.**

---

**「又見離」下，第五兩行問禪，前一行問修根本禪，後一行問修出世上上禪，通途皆得有根本之修也。**

**From "Also seeing separation..." downwards, the fifth part (2 lines) asks about **Dhyāna** (Meditation). The first line asks about cultivating **Fundamental Dhyāna** (*Gēnběn Chán* - Four Dhyānas etc.). The latter line asks about cultivating **Out-of-World Highest Dhyāna** (*Chūshì Shàngshàng Chán*). In general, all paths involve fundamental cultivation.**

**離欲者，若離欲得五通，通教定也。又根本本離欲，背捨亦修不淨等離欲，別教兼離二乘欲，中道又離順道法愛欲(云云)。**

**"Separating from desire": If one separates from desire to obtain Five Superknowledges (*Abhijñā*), this is the Samādhi of the Common Teaching. Also, Fundamental Dhyāna separates from desire; Back-Discarding (*Bèishě* - Eight Liberations) also cultivates impurity to separate from desire. The Distinct Teaching additionally separates from Two Vehicle desires. The Middle Way further separates from the desire of Dharma-Love for the compliant path.**

**深修禪定者，發初禪一品此定未深，乃至九品傳傳為深，又背捨、九定、八勝、十一切入等傳傳為深，此定轉變自在，能發諸通。**

**"Deeply cultivating dhyāna concentration": when one attains the first dhyāna, the first grade, this concentration is not yet deep; up through the ninth grade it becomes deeper and deeper. Further, the Back-Discardings, Nine Samādhis, Eight Victories, Eleven All-Permeations, and so on, become deeper and deeper. This concentration transforms freely and can give rise to various penetrations (*tōng*).**

**凡夫但五通，二乘具六，別教菩薩讓佛分有無漏，亦但稱五通也，圓教初後皆具六通。**

**Commoners have only Five Superknowledges. Two Vehicles possess Six. Distinct Teaching Bodhisattvas defer to the Buddha regarding "Outflows/No-Outflows," so they also claim only Five. The Perfect Teaching from beginning to end possesses Six.[^6]**

**「安禪萬偈」下，第二一行[^31]明上上禪，此是別、圓之禪，靜散不相妨，不起滅定現諸威儀，如修羅琴不拊而韻，無緣無念有感則形，故能安禪讚佛也。**

**From "Peaceful Dhyāna, ten thousand verses" downwards, the second line illuminates **Highest Dhyāna**.[^31] This is the Dhyāna of Distinct and Perfect Teachings. Quietude and Scattering do not obstruct each other. "Without arising from Extinction Samādhi, he manifests various dignities." Like the Asura's Harp playing without being strummed; without condition or thought, if there is a response, it takes form. Thus he can praise the Buddha while in Peaceful Dhyāna.**

---

**「復見智深」下，第六三行問般若，為二：初一行是自行，「智深」者，慧窮理本也；「志固」者，誓願廣大也，此即二種莊嚴，能問、能持也。**

**From "Also seeing Wisdom Deep" downwards, the sixth part (3 lines) asks about **Prajñā** (Wisdom). It has two parts: The first line is **Self-Practice**. "Wisdom Deep" means Wisdom exhausts the Root of Principle. "Will Firm" means Vows are vast and great. This is the **Two kinds of Adornment** (Wisdom & Merit); able to ask and able to hold.**

**「又見佛子定慧」下，次兩行是化他也[^32]，未到慧多，無色定多，四禪等。**

**From "Also seeing Buddha Sons, Samādhi and Wisdom..." downwards, the next two lines are **Transforming Others**.[^32] In Not-Yet-Arrived (*Wèi Dào*) Dhyāna, Wisdom is greater. In Formless (*Wú Sè*) Dhyāna, Samādhi is greater. In the Four Dhyānas, [Samādhi and Wisdom] are equal.**

**又背捨慧多，九定定多，十一切中等。又二乘定多，菩薩慧多，佛則等。又空觀定多，假觀慧多，中觀則等。**

**Further: In the Back-Discardings (*Bèishě*), Wisdom is greater. In the Nine Samādhis, Samādhi is greater. In the Eleven All-Permeations, they are equal. Further: the Two Vehicles have more Samādhi; Bodhisattvas have more Wisdom; the Buddha is equal. Further: the Contemplation of Emptiness has more Samādhi; the Contemplation of the Provisional has more Wisdom; the Contemplation of the Middle is equal.**

**「無量喻」即是種種方便，諸教之中引無量譬類，助顯第一義也。**

**"Immeasurable Similes" refers to various Skillful Means; in all teachings citing immeasurable analogies to assist in revealing the First Principle.**

**「破魔兵」者，空觀破四魔，假觀次第破八魔，中觀圓破八魔、十魔、一切魔。**

**"Breaking Mara's Army": The **Empty View** breaks 4 Maras. The **Provisional View** sequentially breaks 8 Maras. The **Middle View** perfectly breaks 8 Maras, 10 Maras, and All Maras.**

**「擊鼓」者，初發心住便成正覺，百佛世界作佛，圓擊梵輪法鼓。**
**"Beating the Drum": At the First Abode of Generating the Mind, one accomplishes True Awakening, becoming a Buddha in a hundred Buddha Worlds, perfectly beating the Brahma Wheel Dharma Drum.[^11]**

---

### [MIXED QUESTIONING]

**從「又見菩薩寂然宴默」下，第三有十五行半，不歷次第隨見而問。**

**From "Also seeing Bodhisattvas silent and still" downwards, the third part (15.5 lines) is **Mixed Questioning**, asking according to what is seen without following a sequence.**

**問：**

**Question:**

**上六度自收得萬行，何須更問，太煩雜耶？**

**The above Six Pāramitās already gather in the ten-thousand practices; why must one ask again? Is it not too complicated?**

**答：**

**Answer:**

**上問次第者，自漸一途；非次第者，不定一途。既言種種相貌，何啻兩途而言是煩耶？此次第雜亂，兩番六度，擬他土開三藏，後說方等十二部經，辯六度相貌，具如此間不異。**

**The above questioning in sequence is one route of gradualness; non-sequential questioning is not fixed to one route. Since the text says "various marks and appearances," how could it be only two routes and then be called vexing? This mixture of sequential and non-sequential makes two rounds of the Six Pāramitās: it is patterned after the other land opening the Tripiṭaka [teaching], and afterward speaking Vaipulya, the twelve divisions of scripture, distinguishing the marks and appearances of the Six Pāramitās—fully not differing from this land.**

**就雜問中，文為七意：初二行問禪，又二，前一行問入捨禪，即是自行；次「又見菩薩放光」下，第二一行問入悲禪，初是化他。**

**Regarding Mixed Questioning, the text has seven meanings. 1. First 2 lines ask Dhyāna; this has two parts: The first line asks "Entering Renunciation Dhyāna" (*Rù Shě Chán*), which is **Self-Practice**. The next line "Also seeing Bodhisattvas emitting light" asks "Entering Compassion Dhyāna" (*Rù Bēi Chán*), which is **Transforming Others**.**

**菩薩入定、放光種種利益，具出《華嚴》、《思益》(云云)。**

**Detailed benefits of Bodhisattvas entering Samādhi and emitting light are set forth in the *Avataṃsaka* and *Viśeṣacintī-brahma-paripṛcchā Sūtra* (*Sīyì*)[^7].**

**次「又見佛子未甞」下，第二一行問精進，即是《般舟》念佛等法門也。**

**2.  Next, from "Also seeing Buddha Sons never sleeping" downwards (1 line) asks **Vīrya** (Exertion); this refers to Dharma Gates like the *Pratyutpanna* (*Bānzhōu*) Buddha-Recitation.**

**次「又見具戒」下，第三一行問戒，「威儀無缺」，即是初不缺戒，「淨如寶珠」，即是第十究竟戒，中間可解，十戒如《玄義》中說。**

**3.  Next, from "Also seeing those possessing precepts" downwards (1 line) asks **Śīla** (Precepts). "Dignity without lack" is the initial **Non-Lacking Precept**. "Pure like precious pearls" is the tenth **Ultimate Precept**. The middle ones can be understood; the Ten Precepts are explained in the *Xuányì* (*Profound Meaning*) [Fascicle 4].**

**次「又見佛子住忍」下，第四一行半問忍，即生、法二忍。**

**4.  Next, from "Also seeing Buddha Sons abiding in patience" downwards (1.5 lines) asks **Kṣānti** (Patience); this is the Two Patiences of Life and Dharma.**

**次「又見菩薩離戲」下，第五兩行更問禪，「離戲笑」是却掉悔蓋，離「癡眷屬」即除瞋蓋，「近智者」除疑蓋，「一心除亂」是却貪蓋，「攝念山林」除睡蓋。**

**5.  Next, from "Also seeing Bodhisattvas separating from play" downwards (2 lines) asks **Dhyāna** again. "Separating from play and laughter" removes the Cover of Restlessness and Regret. "Separating from foolish retinue" removes the Cover of Anger. "Near the wise" removes the Cover of Doubt. "One-mind removing confusion" removes the Cover of Greed. "Gathering thoughts in mountain forests" removes the Cover of Sleep. [Removing the Five Hindrances/Covers].**

**次從「或見菩薩」至「飲食」下，第六五行問檀，為二：前四行明四事施，「如是」下第二一行結成。**

**6.  Next, from "Some seeing Bodhisattvas" to "Drink and Food" downwards (5 lines) asks **Dāna** (Giving). It has two parts: The first 4 lines clarify giving the Four Requisites [clothing, food, bedding, medicine]. The line from "Thus..." downwards (1 line) concludes it.**

**次「或有菩薩說」下，第七有三行問般若，初一行不可說而說般若，二一行不可觀而觀般若，三一行言語道斷心行處滅，即是說不可說、觀不可觀而論般若也。**

**7.  Next, from "Some Bodhisattvas expound" downwards (3 lines) asks **Prajñā** (Wisdom). 1. The first line is "Speaking the Unspeakable Prajñā." 2. The second line is "Observing the Unobservable Prajñā." 3. The third line is "The Path of Words cut off, place of Mind's Action extinguished"—discussing Prajñā by speaking the unspeakable and observing the unobservable.**

**或可用此三番般若成上見他土說《方等》中六度，或可別擬他土說《方等》後明《大品》教，盛譚般若，寂滅無二，清淨不著，此彼同也。**

**One could use these three rounds of prajñā to complete the above [interpretation]: that in other lands they speak the Six Pāramitās within the Vaipulya (*Fāngděng*) [teachings]. Or one could separately pattern it as: after other lands speak Vaipulya, they then clarify the *Great Perfection of Wisdom* (*Dàpǐn*) teaching, fully discoursing on prajñā—quiescent and non-dual, pure and unattached. In this, that land and this land are the same.**

**或可說寂滅法是《方等》中意，觀諸法性猶如虛空是般若意，正是歷法作觀，法相無二，此義實與《大品》相會。**

**Or one could say: the dharma of quiescent extinction is the intent within Vaipulya; "contemplating the nature of all dharmas as like empty space" is the intent of prajñā. This is precisely making contemplation while passing through dharmas—dharma-marks are non-dual. This meaning truly meets with the *Dàpǐn* [Prajñā] teaching.**

**若作彼土見《法華》意者，「以此妙慧求無上道」一行是也，但見修妙慧人，不見《法華》妙慧座席，若見座席即知此如彼，何事須疑？但見人不見座，闔眾疑問耳。**

**If one takes it as: in that land, it is the meaning of seeing the *Lotus*, then it is the single line: "With this wondrous wisdom they seek the unsurpassed path." One only sees people cultivating wondrous wisdom; one does not see the wondrous-wisdom seat of the *Lotus*. If one saw the seat, one would know this is like that—what would there be to doubt? But the assembly sees the people and does not see the seat; therefore the whole assembly doubts and asks.**

**或可三番般若與此間般若相同，未知此後，次何所說，是故疑問，此兩意從人用之耳。**

**Or one could say: these three rounds of prajñā are the same as the prajñā of this land. Not knowing what will be spoken next after this, therefore they doubt and ask. These two meanings are to be used according to the person [interpreter].**

**上長行文迮但舉六意，偈頌既廣，顯義冷然(云云)。**

**In the prose, the wording is tight and only raises six meanings. Since the verses are expansive, the revealed meaning is clear and coolly distinct (and so on).**

### [ASKING OFFERINGS TO RELICS]

**「文殊師利又有菩薩」下，第六有七行，明佛滅後以舍利起塔者，正頌上他土佛出五濁，從無相一法開漸、頓教，故有二法、三道種種行類相貌不同，如上所見也。**

**From "Manjuśrī, there are also Bodhisattvas" downwards, the sixth part (7 lines) clarifies raising Stupas for Relics after the Buddha's Extinction. This praises [recounts] the fact that the Buddha of that Land appeared in the Five Turbidities, opened Gradual and Sudden Teachings from the One Markless Dharma, hence there are Two Dharmas, Three Paths, and various different marks of practice as seen above.**
*[Critical apparatus: [1] 兕【大】＊，光【甲】＊; [＊1-1] 兕【大】＊，光【甲】＊]*


**今見他土佛般涅槃，佛子慕德為樹墳塔，即表無量悉歸入一、一出無量。**

**Now seeing the Buddha of That Land enter Parinirvāṇa, and Buddha Sons admiring his virtue by erecting Tomb-Stupas (*Fén Tǎ*), symbolizes **Immeasurable returning entering One** and **One producing Immeasurable**.**

**前相已表無量歸一，正是入於涅槃，云何畏妨壽量，作起塔為佛事耶？痛哉！痛哉！**

**The previous omens already symbolized "Immeasurable returning to One," which *is* entering Nirvana. Why fear that this obstructs the [Eternal] Life Span, and thus [avoid] treating "Raising Stupas" as a Buddha Work? Painful! Painful! [Referring to the Old Masters' error].**

**就文為六，初一行總標佛滅起塔；次「又見佛子造」下，第二一行明塔數；次「寶塔高妙」下，第三一行明塔量；次「一一塔」下，第四一行明塔相；次「諸天龍神」下，第五一行明供養；次「文殊」下，第六兩行結。**

**In terms of the text, there are six: first, one line generally marks "the Buddha's extinction and raising a stūpa"; next, from "Also seeing Buddha Sons build..." downwards, the second is one line clarifying the number of stupas; next, from "Treasure stupas, lofty and wondrous..." downwards, the third is one line clarifying the size/measure; next, from "Each and every stūpa..." downwards, the fourth is one line clarifying the stūpa-forms; next, from "The devas, nāgas, and spirits..." downwards, the fifth is one line clarifying the offerings; next, from "Manjuśrī..." downwards, the sixth is two lines concluding.**

**塔婆此云方墳，方墳如此土塚墓，《大灌頂》翻為塚也。殿堂如此土靈宇，崇臺峻階承露干雲，長表淨域歸心上聖耳。**

**"*Stūpa*" (*Tǎpó*) is translated here as **Square Tomb** (*Fāng Fén*). A Square Tomb is like a grave mound (*Zhǒng Mù*) in this land. The *Great Consecration Sutra* translates it as "Grave" (*Zhǒng*). "Palace Halls" are like spirit-shrines in this land; lofty terraces and steep steps receiving dew and drying clouds, long symbolizing the Pure Limit (*Jìng Yù*) and returning the heart to the Superior Sage.**

**樹王者即波利質多，正供舍利傍嚴佛國土。**

**"Tree King" is the **Pārijāta** (*Bōlìzhìduō*)[^8]. Strictly speaking, it offers to the Relics; incidentally, it adorns the Buddha Land.**

### [REQUEST FOR ANSWER & MANJUSHRI'S REPLY]

**從「佛放」下，第二有八行請答，為二：初三行舉疑事述請，後五行釋伏難。**

**From "The Buddha emits [light]..." downwards, the second part (8 lines) is **Requesting an Answer**. It has two parts: 1. First 3 lines raise the doubt and state the request; 2. Latter 5 lines explain **Latent Difficulties** (*Fú Nàn*).**

**初三行為三：初一行舉見此土事，白毫為本故先舉，及諸事故言「種種」；次「諸佛」下，第二一行舉見他土事，諸佛為本即總攝餘五也；「我等」下，第三一行請答。**

**The first 3 lines [of Request] have 3 parts: 1. Raises "Seeing This Land's matters"—White Hair-Mark is the root, thus raised first; "Variously" refers to other matters. 2. Raises "Seeing Other Lands' matters"—Buddhas are the root, encompassing the other five omens. 3. "We and others" asks for an answer.**

**第二就釋伏難為二：初四行正釋伏難，次一行結請。**

**The second part explaining **Latent Difficulties** (*Fú Nàn*)[^9] has two parts: 1. First 4 lines explain the difficulties; 2. Last line implies the request.**

**言伏難者，文殊內心搆難不肯時答，其意有三：一、此瑞希奇，不可倉卒輕爾有判；二、智眾如海謙光推高；三、靳固前却生眾渴仰，故以伏難潛而拒之。**

**"Latent Difficulties" means Manjuśrī internally constructs difficulties and is unwilling to answer immediately. His intent has three points: 1. This Omen is rare and strange; one cannot hastily judge it lightly. 2. The wise assembly is like an ocean; he modestly pushes high [defers to Buddha]. 3. Holding back to generate thirst/admiration in the assembly. Thus he uses Latent Difficulties to subtly refuse.**

**彌勒彰灼，釋難意亦有三：一、瑞大疑大，若不為釋，憂兕[^33]在懷妨聞正說；二、眾海乃多機在仁者；三、闔眾瞻仁，故知注誠殷重，所以彰言釋難，請令時答。**

**Maitreya is explicit/burning (*Zhāng Zhuó*); his intent in explaining the difficulties also has three points: 1. The Omen is Great, Doubt is Great; if not explained, the "Worried Rhinoceros" (*Yōu Sì*)[^33] in the chest will obstruct hearing the True Preaching. 2. Although the Ocean Assembly is many, the Catalyst is in the Benevolent One [Manjuśrī]. 3. The whole assembly looks to the Benevolent One, knowing their sincerity is heavy. Therefore he explicitly explains the difficulties and requests a timely answer.**

**初伏難者，因正請生，請云「佛子文殊願決眾疑」，文殊仍此起初伏難，汝云眾疑，眾未曾疑，若疑應問；眾既不疑，我何所決？**

**1.  **First Latent Difficulty:** Arises from the direct request. The request says "Buddha Son Manjuśrī, please resolve the assembly's doubts." Manjuśrī raises the first difficulty: "You say the assembly doubts? The assembly has not doubted. If they doubted, they would ask. Since they don't doubt, what is there for me to resolve?"**

**彌勒即以第一偈釋云「四眾欣仰瞻仁及我」。及我欲令我問，瞻仁欲得仁答。**

**Maitreya uses the first verse to explain: "The Four Assemblies look up to the Benevolent One and me." "And me" means they want me to ask; "Look up to Benevolent One" means they want you to answer.**

**文殊因此起第二難，眾同有疑，不易可答，待佛出定，然後決疑。**

**2.  **Second Difficulty:** Manjuśrī asks: "If the assembly collectively doubts, it is not easy to answer. Wait for the Buddha to exit Samādhi, then resolve the doubt."**

**彌勒即用第二偈釋，若有疑在，懷憂兕不泰，應以時答。復知如來何時起定，故言「佛子時答，決疑令喜」。**

**Maitreya uses the second verse to explain: "If doubt exists, holding the 'Worried Rhinoceros' is not peaceful. You should answer in time. Who knows when the Tathāgata will exit Samādhi?" Thus he says, "Buddha Son, answer in time; resolve doubts and cause delight."**

**文殊因此起第三難，我與仁者同居學地，欲測佛意微共籌量，獨令我答，於理不可。**

**3.  **Third Difficulty:** Manjuśrī asks: "I and the Benevolent One coexist in the Stage of Learning (*Śaikṣa*). We can consult together to fathom the Buddha's intent. To make *me alone* answer is unreasonable."**

**彌勒即以第三偈釋，我亦微心下思踟蹰兩楹，為說妙法？為當授記？故言「佛坐道場，所得妙法，為欲說此，為當授記。」**

**Maitreya uses the third verse to explain: "I also have a subtle mind and ponder, hesitating between two pillars (*Liǎng Yíng*): Is it to expound Wondrous Dharma? Or is it to bestow Prediction?" Thus he says: "Buddha sits in Bodhimanda, obtained Wondrous Dharma; is it desiring to speak this? Or bestow Prediction?"**

**文殊因此起第四難，若如汝說即是釋疑，何煩我答？**

**4.  **Fourth Difficulty:** Manjuśrī asks: "If it is as you say [prediction/preaching], that *is* explaining the doubt. Why bother me to answer?"**

**彌勒即以第四偈釋，安得以我猶豫之心而判大事？故言「示諸佛土，此非小緣」。文殊伏難既窮，謙光亦止，後一偈結請答也。**

**Maitreya uses the fourth verse to explain: "How can my hesitant mind judge the Great Matter?" Thus he says: "Manifesting Buddha Lands, this is not a small condition." Manjuśrī's latent difficulties are exhausted, his modesty stops. The last verse concludes the Request to Answer.**

**此四伏難，光宅受於次師，次師受於江北釗師；既是先賢文外巧思，今用之。**

**These four "latent difficulties": Guangzhai received them from Master Ci; Master Ci received them from Master Zhao of Jiangbei. Since they are earlier worthies' ingenious reflections outside the text, we adopt them here.[^9]**

### [ANSWERING THE QUESTIONS: PREFACE]

**從「是時文殊師利語彌勒」下訖偈，名答問序，有長行偈頌。**

**From "At that time Manjuśrī said to Maitreya" down to the end of the verses is called the **Preface of Answering Questions**. It has prose and verses.**
*[Critical apparatus: [2] 從【大】，從諸【甲】]*


**長行文為四：一、從[^34]「語彌勒」下，名惟忖答；二、從「善男子我於過去」下，名略曾見答；三、從「諸善男子如過去」下，名廣曾見答；四、從「今見此瑞與本無異」下，名分明判答。**

**The prose has four parts: (1) from "said to Maitreya" downwards, called the **Thinking-and-Measuring Answer** (*Wéi Cǔn Dá*);[^34] (2) from "Good men, in the past..." downwards, called the **Brief Past-Seeing Answer** (*Luè Céng Jiàn Dá*); (3) from "All good men, as in the past..." downwards, called the **Broad Past-Seeing Answer** (*Guǎng Céng Jiàn Dá*); (4) from "Now seeing this omen is no different from the root..." downwards, called the **Clearly Judging Answer** (*Fēnmíng Pàn Dá*).**

**夫以下測上，止可罔像卜度、惟昔儔今，不可頓決，所以初從髣髴，次引略見，略見未周，更引廣見，以多證一，爾乃分判。**

**In general, using what is below to measure what is above can only be a groping image and divining estimate: thinking about the past to compare with the present. One cannot decide abruptly. Therefore, first it starts from the indistinct; next it cites a brief past-seeing. Since the brief past-seeing is not yet complete, it further cites a broad past-seeing, using many to prove one; only then does it make a discriminating judgment.**

**惟忖答，答上此土問；略曾見答，答上他土問；廣曾見答，雙答此土、他土問；判當答，雙判此土他土問也。**

**The Thinking-and-Measuring Answer answers the above question about this land. The Brief Past-Seeing Answer answers the above question about other lands. The Broad Past-Seeing Answer answers both the question about this land and the question about other lands. The Judging Answer judges both the question about this land and the question about other lands.**

---

### [1. THINKING-AND-MEASURING ANSWER]

**惟忖答為二：初、標章；次、正惟忖。**

**The Thinking-and-Measuring Answer has two parts: first, it marks the section; next, it truly thinks and measures.**

**惟者思惟也，忖者忖量，惟今如昔、忖昔如今，然文殊古佛豈應不知？迹示思惟也。**

**"Thinking" means reflecting; "measuring" means gauging. It thinks "the present is like the past" and measures "the past is like the present." Yet Manjuśrī is an ancient Buddha—how could he not know? This is the trace-gate's demonstration of "thinking."**

**光宅以初後兩句是法說，表因果廣略，中間三句是譬說，「欲說大法」是略開三顯一、略開近顯遠；演大法義，是廣開三顯一、廣開近顯遠。**

**Guangzhai takes the first and last two phrases as Dharma-exposition, indicating broad/brief cause and fruit, and takes the middle three phrases as simile-exposition. "Desiring to speak the great Dharma" is the brief opening of three to reveal one, and the brief opening of near to reveal far; "expounding the meaning of the great Dharma" is the broad opening of three to reveal one, and the broad opening of near to reveal far.**

**「大法雨」者，譬得記作佛，昔因果定執不得作佛，是枯涸義；今皆作佛，是被雨潤義。**

**"The great Dharma rain" is a simile for receiving prediction and becoming Buddha. In the past, because cause and fruit were fixedly grasped, one could not become Buddha—this is the meaning of dryness and desiccation. Now all become Buddhas—this is the meaning of being moistened by rain.**

**吹䗍是改三乘之號，嚴鼓誡兵譬破無明。**

**"Blowing the conch" is changing the labels of the Three Vehicles. "Beating the solemn drum and warning the troops" is a simile for breaking ignorance.**

**今明其法，說不用。**

**Now, clarifying the Dharma: this explanation is not used.**

**何者？迹本兩門由籍各異，迹由籍起彌勒生疑，文殊為釋；本由籍未起，彌勒何所疑？文殊何所釋？**

**Why? The trace and the root are two gates whose textual bases are different. In the trace, because of the textual basis Maitreya gives rise to doubt and Manjuśrī explains it. In the root, the textual basis has not arisen—what would Maitreya doubt, and what would Manjuśrī explain?**

**若於此中，已是釋於開近顯遠之疑者，後地裂眾涌，彌勒何故更疑？**

**If, within this, one already takes it as explaining the doubt about opening the near to reveal the far, then later—when the earth splits and the multitude surges forth—why would Maitreya doubt again?**

**更疑則浪疑、浪釋，釋後既虛，釋前亦謬，此大有所妨，故不用也。**

**If he doubts again, then it is pointless doubt and pointless explanation. If the later explanation is empty, then the earlier explanation is also mistaken. This would greatly obstruct [the sutra's structure], so it is not used.**

**今明彌勒但問迹中此彼二土等瑞，文殊以惟忖答，答迹中事，不關〈壽量〉本中事也。**

**Now I clarify: Maitreya only asks about the omens of the trace-gate—this land and that land. Manjuśrī answers with thinking-and-measuring: he answers matters in the trace-gate, and it is not connected to the root-gate matter of the "Lifespan" chapter.**

**「欲說大法」者，答說法瑞；「雨大法雨」，答雨花瑞；「吹大法䗍」，答大眾心喜瑞；「擊大法鼓」，答地動瑞；「演大法義」，答放光瑞。**

**"Desiring to speak the great Dharma" answers the omen of expounding Dharma. "Raining the great Dharma rain" answers the omen of raining flowers. "Blowing the great Dharma conch" answers the omen of the great assembly's rejoicing. "Beating the great Dharma drum" answers the omen of the earth quaking. "Expounding the meaning of the great Dharma" answers the omen of emitting light.**

**「欲說大法」者，惟昔諸佛說無量義後，則開權顯實，收無量歸一；忖於今佛既說法已，亦應開權顯實，會無量以歸一，一者即大法也。**

**As for "desiring to speak the great Dharma": thinking of the past, after the buddhas preached the *Immeasurable Meanings*, they opened the provisional to reveal the real, gathering the immeasurable back into one. Measuring the present: now that the Buddha has already expounded Dharma, he should likewise open the provisional to reveal the real, uniting the immeasurable into one. This "one" is precisely the great Dharma.**

**「雨大法雨」者，惟昔諸佛天雨四花之後，普入圓因住、行、向、地；忖於今佛雨花之後皆成佛因住、行、向、地，故言雨大法雨也。**

**As for "raining the great Dharma rain": thinking of the past, after the buddhas had the heavens rain the four flowers, all enter the Perfect causal stages—abodes, practices, dedications, and grounds. Measuring the present: after the current Buddha rains the flowers, all likewise accomplish the Buddha-causes of abodes, practices, dedications, and grounds. Therefore it says "raining the great Dharma rain."**

**「吹大法䗍」者，惟昔四眾見瑞歡喜，得未曾有，障除機動，即改人教行理；忖今眾喜，亦應障除機動改人教行理，所改既深，故言吹大法䗍也。**

**As for "blowing the great Dharma conch": thinking of the past, when the four assemblies saw the omens they rejoiced, obtaining what they had never had; hindrances were removed and capacities were stirred, and so they changed the person's teaching, practice, and principle. Measuring the present: now that the assembly rejoices, hindrances should likewise be removed and capacities stirred, changing the person's teaching, practice, and principle. Since what is changed is deep, therefore it says "blowing the great Dharma conch."**

**「擊大法鼓」者，惟昔地動已後即有六番破無明賊；忖於今佛地動已後亦應六番破無明惑，聲教極妙，故言擊大法鼓。**

**As for "beating the great Dharma drum": thinking of the past, after the earth quaked there were immediately six rounds of breaking the thieves of ignorance. Measuring the present: after the current Buddha's earth-quaking there should likewise be six rounds of breaking the delusions of ignorance. Since the sound-and-teaching are supremely wondrous, therefore it says "beating the great Dharma drum."**

**「演大法義」者，惟昔諸佛放白毫光後說《法華》彼此道同；忖於今佛放光已後廣明五佛道同，既是佛道，故言演大法義。**

**As for "expounding the meaning of the great Dharma": thinking of the past, after the buddhas emitted the white hair-mark light, they preached the *Lotus*, and the path was the same in that land and this land. Measuring the present: after the current Buddha emits light, he should broadly clarify that the paths of the five buddhas are the same. Since it is the Buddha-path, therefore it says "expounding the meaning of the great Dharma."**

**如是五句悉是惟昔判今，忖今類昔，會文附義唯少入定一瑞，而雨花、動地、放光等，皆由入定故爾，意則兼具，無勞疑也，闕此一條故稱略答耳。**

**Thus these five phrases are entirely: thinking of the past to judge the present, and measuring the present to resemble the past. Aligning text and meaning, there is only the slight absence of the single omen of "entering samādhi." Yet raining flowers, quaking the earth, emitting light, and so forth all occur because of entering samādhi; in meaning it is included, so there is no need to doubt. It is only because this single item is missing that it is called a "brief answer."**

**今更別解，初一句總，後四句別。**

**Now, another separate interpretation: the first phrase is general; the latter four phrases are specific.**

**總者大法是也，別者雨、吹、擊、演開示悟入是也，如天非小大、非赤白，而雨赤白之花。**

**The general is the "great Dharma." The specifics are rain, blow, beat, and expound—opening, showing, awakening, and entering. It is like the sky: it is neither small nor great, neither red nor white, yet it rains red and white flowers.**

---

**如第一義非開示悟入，見此理時即證開示悟入，譬如種子得雨萌開，今聞大法雨，潤法性種，破無明糠，開於十住佛知見也，譬如吹䗍知是改號。**

**Just as the First Principle is not [separately] "opening, showing, awakening, and entering"—when one sees this principle one immediately realizes opening, showing, awakening, and entering—it is like seeds: when they get rain they sprout and open. Now, hearing the great Dharma rain, it moistens the seed of dharma-nature, breaks the husk of ignorance, and opens into the ten abodes' Buddha-knowledge-and-view. It is like: hearing the conch blown, one knows it means a change of name.**

**今之與先已得十住，今從十住聞法更改入十行，示佛知見也，譬如擊鼓知是誡兵。**

**Now, together with what came before, having already attained the ten abodes: now, from the ten abodes, hearing the Dharma, they further change and enter the ten practices—this is showing Buddha-knowledge-and-view. It is like: hearing the drum beaten, one knows it is warning the troops.**

**今之與先已在十行，今從十行聞法誡入迴向，悟佛知見也。**

**Now, together with what came before, already being in the ten practices: now, from the ten practices, hearing the Dharma, they are warned and enter the [ten] dedications, awakening to Buddha-knowledge-and-view.**

**演之言布橫闊豎深，乃是演義。**

**"Expounding" means spreading horizontally in breadth and vertically in depth—this is what "expounding the meaning" is.**

**今之與先已在十向，今從十迴向入於十地，入佛知見，窮源盡邊，深廣備足也。**

**Now, together with what came before, already being in the ten dedications: now, from the ten dedications, they enter the ten grounds, entering Buddha-knowledge-and-view, exhausting the source and reaching the limits—depth and breadth are fully complete.**

**惟昔六瑞已後即開示悟入，忖今瑞後亦應如是，橫豎釋惟忖答竟。**

**Thinking of the past: after the six omens, it immediately opened, showed, awakened, and entered. Measuring the present: after the current omens, it should likewise be so. This completes the horizontal-and-vertical explanation of the Thinking-and-Measuring Answer.**

---

**從「我於過去」下，第二引略曾見答者，初以己智惟忖，今以略曾小分明於前，舉此答他土問也。**

**From "In the past I..." downwards, the second is the cited **Brief Past-Seeing Answer**: first, he used his own wisdom to think and measure; now he uses a brief past-seeing to make a small clarification of what came before, raising this to answer the question about other lands.**

**此土五瑞不通他土，唯放光一瑞遍照東方，略曾見答專答放光，故知是答他土之問也。**

**The five omens of this land do not reach other lands; only the single omen of emitting light shines everywhere in the east. The Brief Past-Seeing Answer exclusively answers the emitting light; therefore we know it answers the question about other lands.**

**今見如昔，昔秖如今，欲令眾生咸得聞知者，即聞、思兩慧，亦信、法兩行，收無量歸一，改三乘教理，六番破無明等，諸佛道同開示悟入佛之知見，故言一切世間難信之法也。**

**"Seeing now is like the past; the past is just like now." "Wishing to cause all sentient beings to hear and know" means the two wisdoms of hearing and thinking, and also the two practices of faith and dharma. It gathers the immeasurable back into one; changes the teaching and principle of the Three Vehicles; has six rounds of breaking ignorance; and so forth. The paths of the buddhas are the same: opening, showing, awakening, and entering the Buddha's knowledge-and-view. Therefore it says: a dharma difficult for all worlds to believe.**

---

**「如過去」下，三引廣曾見答，更分明於略，此廣答此土、他土之問，彌勒因光橫見東方以為問，文殊引昔豎見而為答，橫豎顯諸佛道同也。**

**From "As in the past" downwards, the third is the cited **Broad Past-Seeing Answer**, which is more clearly distinct than the brief: this broadly answers both the question about this land and the question about other lands. Maitreya, because of the light, sees the east horizontally and takes it as a question; Manjuśrī cites the past as a vertical seeing and takes it as an answer. Horizontal and vertical reveal that the Buddha-path is the same.**

**文為三：初、引一佛同，次、引二萬佛同，後、引最後一佛同。**

**The text has three parts: first, citing one Buddha as the same; next, citing twenty thousand Buddhas as the same; last, citing the final Buddha as the same.**

**就前一佛又為三：一、明時節；二、標名；三、說法時節，如文。**

**Within the first (one Buddha), there are again three: (1) clarifying the time-period; (2) marking the name; (3) the time-period of preaching Dharma—as in the text.**

**「有佛號日月標名同」者，通號與今佛可同，別名云何同？此當以名別義同為釋。**

**As for "There was a Buddha named Sun-Moon": the generic epithet can be the same as the current Buddha; how can the specific name be the same? This should be explained as: the name is different but the meaning is the same.**

**何者？日是慧，月是定，定慧是自行德，燈明是化他德，能仁能定，慧能自他。**

**Why? "Sun" is wisdom; "moon" is samādhi. Samādhi and wisdom are virtues of self-practice; "lamp-bright" is the virtue of transforming others. The "Able One" is able in samādhi; wisdom is able for self and others.**

**又日月燈是三智，今佛亦三智，隨緣稱別，義則不殊，故言名同。**

**Further, sun, moon, and lamp are the three wisdoms; the current Buddha also has the three wisdoms. In accord with conditions they are given different names, but the meaning is not different; therefore it says the name is the same.**

**「演說法」下，第三說法同者，昔佛先頓後漸，與今佛初頓後漸同也。**

**From "expounding the Dharma" downwards, the third—preaching Dharma as the same—means: the past Buddha was first sudden and later gradual; this is the same as the current Buddha being first sudden and later gradual.**

**「演說正法初、中、後善」者，即是頓教也。**

**"Expounding the true Dharma—good at the beginning, middle, and end" is precisely the sudden teaching.**

**夫七善之語乃通大小，尋文是大乘七善，初、中、後善者，即是頓教序、正、流通，名為時節善；**

**The phrase "seven goods" in general spans great and small, but looking at the text, it is the Mahāyāna seven goods. The beginning-, middle-, and end-good are precisely the sudden teaching's preface, main discourse, and circulation—this is called the good of time-period.**

**「其義深遠」，即是頓教了義之理，二乘不測其邊底，故言深遠，是名義善。**

**"Its meaning is deep and far-reaching" is the principle of the sudden teaching's definitive meaning. The two vehicles cannot fathom its bounds and depths, so it is called deep and far-reaching—this is called the good of meaning.**

**「其語巧妙」即是頓教八音所吐，會理直說悅菩薩心，即頓教之文，名為語善。**

**"Its words are skillful and subtle" is what the sudden teaching's eight tones utter: meeting the principle and speaking it directly, delighting the bodhisattvas' minds. This is the sudden teaching's wording—this is called the good of words.**

**「純一無雜」不與二乘共，即是頓教獨一善。**

**"Purely one, without mixture"—not shared with the two vehicles—is the sudden teaching's unique one-good.**

**「具足」者，具明界內、界外滿字之法，即是頓教圓滿善。**

**"Complete" means: it fully clarifies the "full-character" dharmas within and beyond the realm—this is the sudden teaching's good of perfect completeness.**

**「清白」，無二邊瑕穢，即是頓教調柔善，師云行善。**

**"Pure and clean"—without the defilements of the two extremes—is the sudden teaching's good of pliant refinement. The master says: the good of conduct.**

**「梵行之相」者，梵即頓教無緣慈善。**

**As for "the mark of Brahma-conduct": Brahma here is the sudden teaching's good of unconditional lovingkindness.**

**又初、中、後善，解者不同，今且依一途，若小乘以戒、定、慧為三善，大乘以初、中、後心為三善。**

**Also, interpreters differ about "good at beginning, middle, and end." For now, rely on one approach: the Hīnayāna takes precepts, samādhi, and wisdom as the three goods; the Mahāyāna takes the beginning-, middle-, and end-mind as the three goods.**

**《金光明》云：「前心如來不可思議，中心如來種種莊嚴，後心如來不可破壞。」此亦三善之意也。**

**The *Golden Light Sutra* says: "The Tathāgata of the prior mind is inconceivable; the Tathāgata of the middle mind has various adornments; the Tathāgata of the latter mind cannot be destroyed." This also conveys the intent of the three goods.**

**文殊引古佛頓教七善，與今佛頓說七善同，亦與他土初頓說同。**

**Manjuśrī cites the ancient Buddha's seven goods of the sudden teaching as the same as the current Buddha's sudden expounding of the seven goods, and also the same as the other land's initial sudden preaching.**

**所以用此為答者，酬上彌勒據光橫問他土佛云聖主師子，演說經法微妙第一，文殊豎引昔舉此為答，即是初佛說頓法同也。**

**The reason he uses this as an answer is: it responds to Maitreya's earlier question—based on the light, he horizontally asked about the other-land Buddha, saying "holy lord and lion," "expounding sutra-dharmas subtle and foremost." Manjuśrī vertically cites the past and raises this as the answer—this is that the initial Buddha's sudden Dharma preaching is the same.**

**「為求聲聞人，說應四諦法」者，即是古佛次頓之後，開漸教法同也。**

**"For those seeking śrāvakas, he preached the dharmas that accord with the Four Truths": this is that, after the ancient Buddha's sudden [teaching], he opened the gradual teaching's dharmas as the same.**

**上問若人遭苦為說《涅槃》，今引古佛亦開此漸，以答斯問也。**

**Above, [Maitreya] asked: "If people encounter suffering" and he speaks of nirvāṇa. Now [Manjuśrī] cites that the ancient Buddha likewise opened this gradual [teaching] to answer that question.**

**「為求辟支佛，說應十二因緣法」，答上若人有福志求勝法之問也。**

**"For those seeking pratyekabuddhas, he preached the dharmas that accord with the Twelve Links of Dependent Arising": this answers the above question of "If people have blessings" and "intent on seeking superior Dharma."**

**「為諸菩薩，說應六波羅蜜」，答上佛子修種種行之問也。**

**"For the bodhisattvas, he preached the dharmas that accord with the Six Pāramitās": this answers the above question of Buddha-sons cultivating various practices.**

**皆引古佛開漸教同也，廣引曾見佛，答他土之問也。**

**All of these cite that the ancient Buddha opened the gradual teaching as the same; broadly citing the Buddhas he had seen in the past answers the question about other lands.**

**「令得三菩提成一切種智」者，此明古佛開頓漸後，即顯實之說始終究竟，此答彌勒見他土佛般涅槃，涅槃後起塔之問也。**

**"Causing them to attain the three bodhis and accomplish all-mode wisdom": this clarifies that, after the ancient Buddha opened sudden and gradual [teachings], he then revealed the real discourse that is ultimately complete from start to finish. This answers Maitreya's question: seeing that-land Buddha enter parinirvāṇa, and raising stupas after parinirvāṇa.**

**若引古佛說法至六波羅蜜者，明今佛已與昔同。從「令得三菩提」去，明今佛當與昔同(云云)。**

**If citing the ancient Buddha's preaching up through the Six Pāramitās clarifies that the current Buddha is already the same as the past, then from "causing them to attain the three bodhis" onward clarifies that the current Buddha will be the same as the past (and so on).**

---

**次引二萬佛，名號、說法皆同。**

**Next it cites twenty thousand Buddhas: their names and their preaching are all the same.**

**初引一佛，備舉頓漸說法同；中舉二萬佛，但舉說頓同，故言初、中、後善也；後引一佛，但舉開漸同。**

**First it cites one Buddha, fully raising the sameness of sudden-and-gradual preaching. In the middle it raises the twenty thousand Buddhas, but only raises the sameness of sudden preaching, therefore it speaks of "good at the beginning, middle, and end." At the end it cites one Buddha, but only raises the sameness of opening the gradual [teaching].**

**所以然者，互舉耳，指前可知。**

**Why is it so? It is mutually raising [different parts]; by pointing to what came before, it can be known.**

**而不引二萬之前佛者，正為名字、說法皆同，據義為便耳。**

**As for not citing the Buddhas before the twenty thousand: it is precisely because their names and preaching are all the same; it is for convenience according to the meaning.**

**「姓頗羅墮」者，此翻捷疾，亦云利根，亦云滿語也。**

**As for "the surname *Póluóduò*": this is translated as swift/rapid; it is also called sharp faculties; it is also called full speech.**

---

**「其最後」下，第三引一佛同。**

**From "As for the final..." downwards, the third is citing one Buddha as the same.**

**文為三：一、明曾見事與今已同；二、明曾見事與今今同；三、明曾見事與今當同。**

**The text has three parts: (1) clarifying that what was seen in the past is the same as the present "already"; (2) clarifying that what was seen in the past is the same as the present "now"; (3) clarifying that what was seen in the past is the same as the present "will be."**

**曾謂昔之所更，已謂謝在過去，曾之與已俱謝、俱更，今取久遠者為曾，小近者謂已；取六瑞等為今，取佛出定去為當也。**

**"Past" (*céng*) means what was changed in the past; "already" (*yǐ*) means what has gone and is in the past. Both "past" and "already" have gone and have changed. Here it takes what is long-ago and distant as "past," and what is near and small as "already." It takes the six omens and the like as "now," and it takes the Buddha leaving samādhi as "will be."**

**第一，從「其最後佛有八子」者，是曾與已同。**

**First, from "the final Buddha had eight sons": this is past-same-as-already.**

**昔佛八子今佛一子，數雖不等，並出同居之土，土有見思俱示有子，有子事同，一八赴緣別有所表，生一子總表一道清淨，生八子表八正道，數異義同，今取有子義同也。**

**The past Buddha had eight sons; the current Buddha has one son. Although the numbers are not equal, both arise from the land of shared residence. Since the land has view-and-thought [delusions], it both-times manifests having sons; the "having sons" matter is the same. The one and the eight respond to conditions and separately symbolize something: giving birth to one son generally symbolizes the one pure path; giving birth to eight sons symbolizes the eightfold noble path. The numbers differ but the meaning is the same; here it takes the meaning of "having sons" as the same.**

**又昔佛子出家發大乘意，今佛子住小乘果，此云何同？**

**Further, the past Buddha's son left home and aroused the Mahāyāna intent, while the current Buddha's son abides in the Hīnayāna fruition—how is this the same?**

**昔化道已竟，顯本事彰，故言發大乘意；今未發迹猶言羅漢，至下文發本，即是菩薩，其義則同。**

**In the past, transformation and conversion were already completed, and the manifestation of the root matter was made clear; therefore it says "arousing Mahāyāna intent." Now, traces not yet revealed, he is still called an arhat; when below the text reveals the root, he is a bodhisattva—its meaning is the same.**

**從「是時日月燈佛說大乘經」下，第二明曾與今同。**

**From "At that time Sun Moon Lamp Buddha preached the Great Vehicle Sutra" downwards, the second part clarifies **Past Same as "Now"** (*Céng Yǔ Jīn Tóng*).[^12]**

**昔佛自土六瑞悉與今同，次第如文。**

**Ancient Buddha's Own Land Six Omens are all same as Now; the sequence is as in the text.**

**昔佛他土六瑞，總云如今所見，則知昔佛他土六瑞亦與今同；**

**Ancient Buddha's Other Land Six Omens are summarized as "Like what is seen now"; thus we know Ancient Buddha's Other Land Six Omens are also same as Now.**

**昔明別序，既有現相、懷疑二序同，而無集眾、發問、答問三序者，義推則有，**

**Ancient text clarified the Specific Preface. Since it has "Manifesting Omens" and "Harboring Doubts"—these two Prefaces are Same. But "Gathering Assembly," "Asking Questions," and "Answering Questions"—these three Prefaces [seem absent]. Inferring from meaning, they exist.**

**既言說法知必集眾，既道懷疑知應有問，若問必答，例二必兼，得三序同也。**

**Since it speaks of "Expounding Dharma," we know the Assembly must Gather. Since it speaks of "Harboring Doubt," we know there must be Questioning. If there is Questioning, there must be Answering. Applying the example of two, the [other] three must be included. Thus Three Prefaces are Same.**

**又若述昔答，則不俟文殊費辭，既不言答亦不出問，其義可解。**

**Also, if it narrated the Ancient Answer, it would not wait for Manjuśrī to waste words [now]. Since it does not state the Answer nor produce the Question, the meaning can be understood.**

## 14. MANJUSHRI'S ANSWER

### [D. PRESENT SAME AS "WILL BE"]

**從「時有菩薩名曰妙光」下，第三，明曾與當同。**

**From "At that time there was a Bodhisattva named **Wonderfully Bright** (*Miào Guāng*)[^14] downwards, the third part clarifies **Past Same as "Will Be"** (*Céng Yǔ Dāng Tóng*).**

**此文為六：**

**This text has six parts:**

**一、從「時有菩薩」者，是因人同；**

**1. From "At that time there was a Bodhisattva": **Depending Person Same** (*Yīn Rén Tóng*).**

**二、從「爾時日月燈明佛從三昧起」者，是說法名同；**

**2. From "At that time Sun Moon Lamp Bright Buddha rose from Samādhi": **Preaching Name Same**.**

**三、從「六十小劫」者，是時節同；**

**3. From "Sixty Small Kalpas": **Time Period Same**.**

**四、從「說是經已於梵魔沙門」者，是唱滅同；**

**4. From "After preaching this Sutra, among Brahmas, Māras, and Śramaṇas": **Announcing Extinction Same**.**

**五、從「時有菩薩名曰德藏」者，是授記同；**

**5. From "At that time there was a Bodhisattva named Virtue Store": **Bestowing Prediction Same**.**

**六、從「便於中夜」者，明滅後通經同。**

**6. From "Then at midnight": Clarifies **Post-Extinction Passing Sutra Same** (*Tōng Jīng Tóng*).**

#### [1. DEPENDING PERSON SAME]

**今初，云何因人同？昔佛定起，因妙光菩薩說經，今佛定起，因身子聲聞說經，此云何同？**

**Now the first: How is "Depending Person" Same? Ancient Buddha rose from Samādhi and, depending on Wonderfully Bright Bodhisattva, preached the Sutra. Current Buddha rose from Samādhi and, depending on **Śāriputra** (*Shēnzǐ*) the Śrāvaka, preached the Sutra. How is this Same?**

**瑤師云：「因者因託，付傳一乘之經，非直對告之人也。」**

**Master Yáo[^10] says: "Depending (*Yīn*) means Depending/Entrusting (*Yīn Tuō*); entrusting the transmission of the One Vehicle Sutra, not merely the person addressed directly."**

**彼佛對告何必是妙光？如今對告身子，身子未必能有宣通，因託宣通莫若妙光，如今因委莫若文殊，今佛不歎者，往佛何必歎也？**

**That Buddha's direct address—why must it be Wonderfully Bright? Like now addressing Śāriputra; Śāriputra is not necessarily capable of propagating/transmitting. Depending/Entrusting propagation is none other than Wonderfully Bright; like now Entrusting is none other than Manjuśrī. If Current Buddha does not praise [Manjuśrī], why must Ancient Buddha praise [Wonderfully Bright]?**

**文殊引往佛歎妙光者，正明可因託耳。**

**Manjuśrī citing Ancient Buddha praising Wonderfully Bright correctly clarifies that he *can* be relied upon/entrusted.**

**又舊以藥王為所因人者，亦可爾，但引往證今，小不類耳。**

**Also, old interpretations take **Medicine King** (*Yàowáng*) as the person relied upon. This is also permissible, but citing Past to verify Present, it slightly doesn't match categories.**

**或言，因文殊釋疑，得起定說經，此對不便。今明不爾，經文自云因妙光正說，而作因託流通之解，**

**Some say: Because Manjuśrī resolved doubts, [Buddha] got to rise from Samādhi and preach. This correspondence is inconvenient. Now I clarify it is not so. The Sutra text itself says "Depending on Wonderfully Bright to Preach Correctly" (*Zhèng Shuō*). Yet they create an interpretation of "Depending/Entrusting for Propagation" (*Liú Tōng*).**

**又取藥王為例，此乃公抗佛語，何關釋經？**

**Also taking Medicine King as an example—this is publicly resisting the Buddha's words! How does this concern explaining the Sutra?**

**昔因妙光、今因身子，正是所因人同。**

**Anciently depending on Wonderfully Bright, Now depending on Śāriputra—this is precisely **Depending Person Same**.**

**昔佛八子師於妙光，如來起定對告妙光，又付託妙光；今佛子羅云亦師身子，佛從定起亦對告身子，**

**Ancient Buddha's Eight Sons took Wonderfully Bright as Master; Tathāgata rose from Samādhi and addressed Wonderfully Bright, and entrusted Wonderfully Bright. Current Buddha's Son Rāhula also takes Śāriputra as Master; Buddha rises from Samādhi and also addresses Śāriputra.**

**迹門竟又付託身子，今古孱齊更若為勝此，而近棄身子遠取藥王？**

**After the **Trace Gate** concludes, He also entrusts Śāriputra [in *Transmission* chapter?]. Present and Ancient are equal/level (*Chán Qí*); how could there be anything surpassing this? Why closely abandon Śāriputra and distantly take Medicine King?**

**疑者言：「妙光是菩薩，身子是聲聞，云何是同？」**

**Doubter says: "Wonderfully Bright is a Bodhisattva. Śāriputra is a Śrāvaka. How are they Same?"**

**昔事已彰譚為菩薩，今事未發道是聲聞，比及發迹，身子是大菩薩，非同何謂？**

**Ancient matters are already manifest, so he is discussed as Bodhisattva. Current matters are not yet revealed, so he is said to be Śrāvaka. Wait until the **Trace is Revealed** (*Fā Jī*): Śāriputra is a Great Bodhisattva. If not Same, what is it?**

**昔妙光垂迹，何必不作聲聞？特是文殊巧說，方便隱顯耳。**

**When Ancient Wonderfully Bright manifested Traces, why must he *not* have acted as a Śrāvaka? It is specially Manjuśrī's skillful speech, employing Skillful Means to **Hide and Reveal** (*Yǐn Xiǎn*).**

#### [2. PREACHING NAME SAME]

**從「是時日月」下，第二、說法名同者，如文。**

**From "At that time Sun Moon" downwards, the second part "Preaching Name Same" is as in text.**

**上彌勒見他土初頓，頓後見漸，漸後見種種行，行後無境，後見佛涅槃；**

**Above, Maitreya saw Other Lands: First **Sudden**; after Sudden seeing **Gradual**; after Gradual seeing **Various Practices**; after Practices seeing no [further] object, then seeing Buddha enter **Nirvana**.**

**今文殊答曾見佛初，頓頓後漸，後云種種行，即見《法華》。**

**Now Manjuśrī answers Past Seeing Buddha: First **Sudden**; after Sudden, **Gradual**; afterwards saying "Various Practices" *is* seeing the *Lotus Sutra*.**

**此彼六瑞之後已說《法華》，《法華》後即入涅槃，此分明定答他土之問也。**

**This and That [Land], after Six Omens, already preached *Lotus Sutra*. After *Lotus*, immediately entered Nirvana. This clearly and definitely answers the Question of Other Lands.**

#### [3. TIME PERIOD SAME]

**從「六十小」下，第三、時節同者，如下文云：「五十小劫謂如半日」，即是同也。**

**From "Sixty Small [Kalpas]" downwards, the third part "Time Period Same": As the text below says "Fifty Small Kalpas were perceived as half a day." This is Same.**

#### [4. ANNOUNCING EXTINCTION SAME]

**從「日月燈明」下，第四、唱滅同者，昔說《法華》即唱入滅，亦如迦葉佛(云云)。**

**From "Sun Moon Lamp Bright" downwards, the fourth part "Announcing Extinction Same": Anciently preaching *Lotus* then immediately announcing entry into Extinction; also like Kāśyapa Buddha.**

**今佛說〈寶塔品〉中，明如來不久當入涅槃，化道已足，唱滅事齊也。**

**Current Buddha, in the *Jeweled Stupa Chapter*, clarifies the Tathāgata will soon enter Nirvana. Transformation Way is sufficient. The matter of Announcing Extinction is equal/aligned.**

#### [5. BESTOWING PREDICTION SAME]

**「時有菩薩」下，第五、授記同者，昔授德藏菩薩記，今經授聲聞記，豈得是同？**

**From "At that time there was a Bodhisattva" downwards, the fifth part "Bestowing Prediction Same." Anciently bestowed prediction on **Virtue Store** (*Dé Zàng*) Bodhisattva. Current Sutra bestows prediction on Śrāvakas. How can this be Same?**
*[Critical apparatus: [7] 說【大】，疑【甲】; [8] 記【大】，說記【甲】]*


**昔事已成故言授菩薩記，然正是會三歸一，聲聞得記也。**

**Ancient matter is already accomplished, so it says "Bestowed Bodhisattva Prediction." However, it was precisely **Uniting Three to Return to One**, where Śrāvakas received prediction.**

**若說昔授聲聞記者，佛從定起，更何所論？文殊巧譚故不發迹耳。**

**If he said "Anciently bestowed Śrāvaka Prediction," [then when] Buddha rises from Samādhi [now], what more would be discussed? [The surprise would be spoiled]. Manjuśrī speaks skillfully, therefore does not reveal the Trace [of Śāriputra].**

**若說授菩薩記，諸經皆爾，執教者未驚也(云云)。**

**If he says "Bestowed Bodhisattva Prediction," all Sutras are like this; those attached to Teaching would not be surprised.**

#### [6. PASSING SUTRA SAME]

**從「佛授記已」下，第六、通經同。文為五：一、時節，即佛滅後也；二、出其人，即妙光也；**

**From "Buddha having bestowed prediction" downwards, the sixth part "Passing Sutra Same." Text has five parts:**
1. **Time Period: After Buddha's Extinction.**
2. **Producing the Person: Wonderfully Bright.**

**三、久近，即八十小劫也；四、所化之眾，即八子八百也；五、結會古今，即求名妙德等也。**

3. **Duration (*Jiǔ Jìn*): Eighty Small Kalpas.**
4. **Assembly Transformed: Eight Sons and Eight Hundred [Disciples].**
5. **Concluding/Uniting Ancient and Present: "Fame Seeker," "Wonderfully Virtuous" etc.**

**就所化之人又為二：初、八子行成久已得佛，八百之一方成今住補處。**

**Regarding the Transformed People, there are two:**
1. **Eight Sons' practice accomplished, long ago attained Buddhahood.**
2. **One of the Eight Hundred just accomplished, now abides in Designated Succession (*Bǔ Chù* - Maitreya).**

**所以引此八子八百者，近則釋疑密開壽量。**

**The reason for citing Eight Sons and Eight Hundred: **Near** purpose is resolving doubt; **Secret** purpose is Opening the Life Span.**

**釋疑者，或謂彌勒補處為大，文殊非補處為小，小不應答，大不應問，**

**Resolving Doubt: Some might say Maitreya (Successor) is Great; Manjuśrī (Non-Successor) is Small. Small should not Answer; Great should not Ask.**

**故舉八百，宜應有問，妙光昔親對佛，先復為師，故釋疑非謬。**

**Therefore raising the "Eight Hundred" [including Maitreya]: It is suitable he should Ask. Wonderfully Bright anciently personally faced the Buddha and was teacher to the predecessors. Thus resolving doubt is not erroneous.**

**密開壽量者，八子最小佛號然燈，然燈是定光，妙光是釋迦九世祖師，**

**Secretly Opening Life Span: The youngest of Eight Sons was Buddha named Dīpaṃkara (*Rán Dēng*). Dīpaṃkara is "Fixed Light" (*Dìng Guāng*). Wonderfully Bright is Śākyamuni's Ninth Generation Ancestral Teacher.**

**孫今成佛，師、祖為弟子，師弟無定，將密顯生非生、滅非滅之意。**

**The Grandson [Śākyamuni] now becomes Buddha; the Teacher/Ancestor [Manjuśrī] becomes Disciple [of Śākyamuni]. Teacher and Disciple are not fixed. This intends to secretly reveal **Birth is Non-Birth, Extinction is Non-Extinction**.**

**問：彌勒昔見諸佛，曾聞《法華》，何故疑問？**

**Question: Maitreya anciently saw all Buddhas and already heard the *Lotus*. Why does he doubt and ask?**

**答：時眾機宜應須扣發耳。**

**Answer: The Capacity (*Jī*) of the current Assembly required knocking/activation (*Kòu Fā*).**

### [4. CLEARLY JUDGING ANSWER]

**第四、從「今見此瑞」下，名分明判答。**

**Fourth, from "Now seeing this omen" downwards, is called **Clearly Judging Answer**.**

**今昔六瑞既同，惟忖決定不謬，略曾、廣曾，皆決定也。**

**Since Ancient and Current Six Omens are Same[^13], the **Thinking Answer** is definitely not erroneous; **Brief Past** and **Broad Past** are all Definite/Decided.**

**「當說大乘」，決定前說法瑞也；「名妙法蓮華」，決定前雨花瑞也；**

**"Will preach Great Vehicle": Decides the previous Omen of **Expounding Dharma**.**
**"Named Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower": Decides the previous Omen of **Raining Flowers**.**

**「教菩薩法」，決定前眾喜瑞也；「佛所護念」，決定前地動瑞也。**

**"Teaching Bodhisattva Dharmas": Decides the previous Omen of **Assembly Rejoicing**.**
**"Buddha supposedly protects/mindfulness" (*Fó Suǒ Hù Niàn*): Decides the previous Omen of **Earth Shaking**.**

**兼總入定悉在其中，有人作已同當同，不作今同。**

**Simultaneously, the general "Entering Samādhi" is entirely within it. Some people make "Already Same" and "Will Be Same," but do not make "Now Same" (*Jīn Tóng*).**

**尋文云：「今見此瑞與本無異」，此正語於今，云何喚六瑞作已？據此文為今，故作三同之釋也。**

**Seeking the text "Now seeing this omen is no different from the Root": This correctly speaks of **Now**. How can one call Six Omens "Already"? Based on this text being "Now," I make the interpretation of **Three Sames** [Past, Now, Future].**

### [MANJUSHRI'S VERSES]

**頌有四十五行偈，不頌上惟忖略曾見答，於廣曾見中，但頌前後，不頌中間也。**

**The verses have forty-five lines; they do not versify the preceding Thinking-and-Measuring and Brief Past-Seeing answers. Within the Broad Past-Seeing, they only versify the beginning and end, not the middle.**

**初、有兩行，頌廣曾見中時節、名號、說法等同也。**

**First, there are two lines: they versify that within the Broad Past-Seeing, the time-period, name, preaching, and so on are the same.**

**從「佛未出家」下，第二、有三十九行偈，頌最後佛三同，次有四行頌決定答。**

**From "Before the Buddha left home..." downwards, the second part has thirty-nine lines of verses: it versifies the final Buddha's three samenesses; next there are four lines versifying the decisive answer.**

**就第二三同中有三：初、有一行偈，頌曾與已同；次第二、有十五行半，頌曾與今同；第三、次有二十二行半，頌曾與當同。**

**Within this second section (the three samenesses), there are three: first, one line of verse versifies past-same-as-already; second, fifteen and a half lines versify past-same-as-now; third, twenty-two and a half lines versify past-same-as-will-be.**

**從「佛說大」下，第二、就今同中又二：初、十四行頌此彼六瑞；第二、從爾時四部眾下一行半，頌四眾懷疑。**

**From "The Buddha preached the great..." downwards, second, within the "now-same" there are again two: first, fourteen lines versify the six omens of this land and that land; second, from "At that time the fourfold assembly..." downwards (one and a half lines) versifies the four assemblies harboring doubt.**

**初又二：初、有四行偈，頌此土六瑞同，而長出天鼓自鳴，表無問自說也。**

**The first also has two: first, four lines of verse versify that this land's six omens are the same, and additionally bring out "the heavenly drums sound of themselves," indicating preaching without being asked.**

**「現諸希有事」者，即總頌諸瑞也。**

**"Manifesting various rare events" is the general versification of the various omens.**

**從「此光照」下，第二、次十行，頌他土六瑞同，長行但云：「如今所見是諸佛土」，其文則略、此頌廣也。**

**From "This light illumines..." downwards, second, the next ten lines versify that the other lands' six omens are the same. The prose only says: "What is now seen are the Buddha-lands"; its wording is abbreviated, but these verses are expansive.**

**文為五：**

**The text has five parts:**

**初、三行頌見六趣眾生同；**

**First: three lines versify the sameness of seeing sentient beings in the six destinies.**

**次、「又見諸如來」下，第二、一行兩句，頌見佛同；**

**Next, from "Also seeing the Tathāgatas..." downwards: second, one line and two phrases versify the sameness of seeing the Buddha.**

**次、「世尊在」下，第三、兩句頌聞佛說頓教七善法同也；**

**Next, from "The World-Honored One is..." downwards: third, two phrases versify the sameness of hearing the Buddha preach the sudden teaching's seven good dharmas.**

**次、「一一諸佛」下，第四、三行，頌見聲聞等三乘，即是昔佛開漸教法同也；**

**Next, from "In each and every Buddha-land, the śrāvaka assembly..." downwards: fourth, three lines versify seeing śrāvakas and the like—the three vehicles. This is that the past Buddha opened the gradual teaching's dharmas as the same.**

**次、「又見諸菩薩」下，第五、二行頌見菩薩種種因緣，即是頌開方等、般若教同。**

**Next, from "Also seeing bodhisattvas..." downwards: fifth, two lines versify seeing bodhisattvas and their various causes-and-conditions; this is versifying that opening the Vaipulya and Prajñā teachings is the same.**

**初、三行如文。**

**First: the three lines are as in the text.**

**第二、一行半釋。「自然成佛道」者，方便道則加心修習，發真道即是自然任運與理合也，約四教可知(云云)。**

**Second: one and a half lines of explanation. As for "naturally accomplishing the Buddha-path": on the expedient path one adds mind and cultivates; when the true path is aroused, it is naturally and effortlessly in accord with principle. This can be known in terms of the four teachings (and so on).**

**問：**

**Question:**

**發真自然者，何須諸佛說法？**

**If arousing the true [path] is natural, why is there need for the buddhas to preach Dharma?**
*[Critical apparatus: [5] 自【大】，若自【甲】]*


**答：**

**Answer:**

**如船順流，若遇風、加棹助，疾有所至，風喻見佛聞法，棹喻修行。**

**It is like a boat going with the current: if it meets wind and adds oar-assistance, it quickly reaches its destination. The wind is a metaphor for seeing the Buddha and hearing Dharma; the oars are a metaphor for cultivation.**
*[Critical apparatus: [6] 成【大】，〔－〕【甲】]*


**例如初果任運七生，若值佛加修，或一生、二生得至無學(云云)。**

**For example, the first fruit naturally proceeds through seven births; if one meets a Buddha and adds cultivation, one may reach the stage of no-more-learning in one or two lives (and so on).**

**「自然成佛道」是報身，「瑠璃」是法身本淨，「金像」是應物現形。**

**"Naturally accomplishing the Buddha-path" is the reward body. "Lapis-lazuli" is the dharma-body's original purity. "Golden image" is responding to beings by manifesting form.**

**「世尊在大眾敷演深法義」下，第三、半行，此則將法約人，法既深玄，當知必運大機開頓教也，此頌上純一無雜七善之文。**

**From "The World-Honored One, in the great assembly, spreads forth the meaning of deep dharma" downwards: third, half a line. This takes Dharma in terms of people. Since the Dharma is deep and mysterious, we should know it surely conveys great capacities and opens the sudden teaching. This versifies the above text about "purely one without mixture"—the seven goods.**

**「一一諸佛土聲聞眾」下，第四、三行，此即將人約法，人既二乘，必知開三藏說也，即頌上為聲聞人說應四諦等也，雖不頌出緣覺兼攝在中，行施、忍辱等，等於四度耳，此一行頌上六度大乘也。**

**From "In each and every Buddha-land, the śrāvaka assembly" downwards: fourth, three lines. This takes people in terms of Dharma. Since the people are the two vehicles, one must know it is opening the Tripiṭaka preaching. That is: it versifies the above about preaching dharmas that accord with the Four Truths for śrāvaka people. Although it does not versify pratyekabuddhas explicitly, they are included within it. Practicing giving, patience, and so on corresponds to the four pāramitās. This single line versifies the above Mahāyāna of the Six Pāramitās.**
*[Critical apparatus: [7] 等【大】，等教【甲】]*


**「又見菩薩深入諸禪定」下，第五、兩行，頌上見他土菩薩種種因緣信解相貌也，略不答上起塔也，上不見他土法華相故。次此見起塔，今答出法華相故，起塔入滅事在後答也。**

**From "Also seeing bodhisattvas deeply enter various dhyāna concentrations" downwards: fifth, two lines. This versifies the above about seeing in other lands bodhisattvas' various causes-and-conditions, faith, understanding, and marks. It briefly does not answer the above about raising stupas, because above it did not see the other land's Lotus marks. Next it sees raising stupas; now the answer brings out the Lotus marks; the matters of raising stupas and entering extinction are answered later.**

**次、「爾時四部眾」下，第二、一行半，追頌昔佛四眾疑念，如文。**

**Next, from "At that time the fourfold assembly" downwards: second, one and a half lines. This retrospectively versifies the past Buddha's fourfold assembly harboring doubts, as in the text.**
*[Critical apparatus: [8] 二【大】，二有【甲】; [9] 四偈【大】，我見下四行偈【甲】; [10] 燈【大】，燈明【甲】; [＊5-1] 有【大】＊，〔－〕【甲】＊; [1] 召【大】，名【甲】; [2] 美【大】，義美【甲】]*


**從「天人所奉尊」下，二十二行半，頌曾與今當同，文為六：**

**From "Honored one venerated by devas and humans" downwards: twenty-two and a half lines versify the past being the same as the present and the future. The text has six parts:**

**初、兩行二句，頌因人同；**

**First: two lines and two phrases versify the sameness of the causal person.**

**次、「說是法下」，第二、一句，頌上說法同；**

**Next, from "Having preached this Dharma..." downwards: second, one phrase versifies the sameness of the preaching.**

**次、「滿六十小劫」下，第三、一行一句，頌時節同，約不思議延促劫智也，妙光皆悉受持昔佛法也，亦如身子受佛付囑也；**

**Next, from "Filling sixty small kalpas" downwards: third, one line and one phrase versify the sameness of the time-period, in terms of the wisdom of inconceivable extension and contraction of kalpas. Wonderfully Bright fully receives and holds the past Buddha's Dharma, like Śāriputra receiving the Buddha's entrustment.**

**次、「佛說是法華」下，第四、五行，頌上唱滅同，即是答上他土入滅之意也，就此文有唱滅、有囑累，囑累如《遺教》，有悲泣如《涅槃》，有慰喻亦如《遺教》，其得度者悉皆得度，未度者作得度因緣，例如今佛將付彌勒(云云)。**

**Next, from "The Buddha preached this Lotus" downwards: fourth, five lines versify the above sameness of announcing extinction—this answers the above meaning of the other-land Buddha entering extinction. In this text there is announcing extinction and entrustment: the entrustment is like the *Bequeathed Teachings*; there is sorrow and weeping like the *Nirvāṇa*; there is consoling admonition also like the *Bequeathed Teachings*. Those who can be liberated all attain liberation; those not yet liberated are made causes-and-conditions for attaining liberation—like the current Buddha being about to entrust [the teaching] to Maitreya (and so on).**

**次、「是德藏」下，第五、有一行半，頌上授記；**

**Next, from "This Virtue-Store" downwards: fifth, one and a half lines versify the above bestowing of prediction.**

**次、「佛此夜」，第六、有十二行，頌上通經，通經又為五：**

**Next, from "This night the Buddha..." downwards: sixth, twelve lines versify the above passing-on of the sutra. The passing-on has five parts:**

**初、有兩行，頌上佛滅後時節四眾得益，「如薪盡火滅」者，小乘佛以果報身為薪、智慧為火，慧依報身、身滅智亡；大乘佛以機為薪、逗應為火，眾生機盡、應形亦滅。「倍加精進」者，應以滅度度者也。**

**First: two lines versify the above about after the Buddha's extinction, the time-period and the fourfold assembly gaining benefit. As for "like fire is extinguished when the fuel is exhausted": in the Small Vehicle, the Buddha takes the retribution-body as fuel and wisdom as fire; wisdom relies on the retribution-body—when the body is extinguished, the wisdom perishes. In the Great Vehicle, the Buddha takes capacities as fuel and responsive manifestation as fire; when beings' capacities are exhausted, the responsive form is also extinguished. As for "redoubling exertion": it is those who are to be guided through extinction being guided.**

**次、「是妙光」下，第二、有兩句，頌上能弘經之人。**

**Next, from "This is Wonderfully Bright" downwards: second, two phrases versify the above person able to propagate the sutra.**

**次、「八十小劫」下，第三、有兩句，頌上行經時節；**

**Next, from "Eighty small kalpas" downwards: third, two phrases versify the above time-period of practicing the sutra.**

**次、「是諸八王」下，第四、有八行，頌上所益弟子，又為二：初、三行頌已成弟子；次、「是妙光」下，第二、五行頌當成弟子。**

**Next, from "These eight princes" downwards: fourth, eight lines versify the above disciples who were benefited. This has two parts: first, three lines versify those who have already become disciples; next, from "This is Wonderfully Bright" downwards, second, five lines versify those who will become disciples.**

**次、「彼佛滅」下，第五、有一行，頌上結會古今。**

**Next, from "That Buddha's extinction" downwards: fifth, one line versifies the above conclusion that unites past and present.**

**後四偈，舊云是結成令物慕仰，今釋不爾，上長行有分明判答，此文頌之，文為三：**

**The final four verses: the old say this is concluding in order to cause beings to yearn and admire; now I explain it is not so. Above, the prose has a clearly judging answer; these verses versify it. The text has three parts:**

**初、「我見燈」下，初、有一行，頌上當說大乘經；**

**First, from "I see Lamp..." downwards: first, one line versifies the above "will preach the Great Vehicle sutra."**

**次、「今相如本」下，第二、兩行，頌上教菩薩法；**

**Next, from "Now the marks are like the root" downwards: second, two lines versify the above "teaching bodhisattva dharmas."**

**次、「諸求三乘人」下，第三、一行，頌上佛所護念，在文可解。**

**Next, from "All those seeking the three vehicles" downwards: third, one line versifies the above "Buddha's protection and mindfulness." In the text it can be understood.**

**又前彌勒釋四伏難，令文殊必定有答，此中是文殊斷四伏疑，使彌勒莫復更問。**

**Further, earlier Maitreya explained the four latent difficulties, causing Manjuśrī certainly to have an answer. Here, it is Manjuśrī cutting off the four latent doubts, causing Maitreya not to ask again.**

**初、第一疑，因文殊廣引先佛曾說《法華》，故彌勒潛疑欲問：「諸佛赴緣，人時各異，古佛雖名《法華》，今佛何必如此？」**

**First, the first doubt: because Manjuśrī broadly cited that prior buddhas had preached the *Lotus*, Maitreya secretly doubts and wishes to ask: "Buddhas respond to conditions; persons and times differ. Although the ancient Buddha was named 'Lotus,' why must the current Buddha be the same?"**

**文殊即以第一偈斷云：「我見燈明佛，本光瑞如此，以是知今佛，欲說法華經。」此斷其疑名之問也。**

**Manjuśrī immediately cuts it off with the first verse, saying: "I see the Lamp-Bright Buddha; the root light-omen was like this. By this I know the current Buddha desires to preach the Lotus Sutra." This cuts off the doubt about the name.**

**彌勒因此又疑：「自有名同義同，自有名同義異，此名何所顯召？」**

**Because of this, Maitreya again doubts: "Some have the same name and the same meaning; some have the same name and different meanings. What does this name reveal and indicate?"**

**文殊即以第二偈斷云：「今相如本瑞，是諸佛方便，今佛放光明，助發實相義。」此是斷其疑體之問。**

**Manjuśrī immediately cuts it off with the second verse, saying: "The current marks are like the root-omen; this is the buddhas' skillful means. The current Buddha emits light to assist in bringing forth the meaning of real marks." This cuts off the doubt about the substance.**

**彌勒因此又疑：「實相無相，何人會之？」**

**Because of this, Maitreya again doubts: "Real marks are markless—who can comprehend it?"**

**文殊即以第三偈斷云：「諸人今當知，合掌一心待，佛當雨法雨，充足求道者。」此斷其疑宗之問。**

**Manjuśrī immediately cuts it off with the third verse, saying: "All people now should know: with joined palms, wait with one mind; the Buddha will rain the Dharma rain, fully satisfying those who seek the path." This cuts off the doubt about the principle.**

**彌勒因此又疑：「佛雨法雨，止洽菩薩？亦潤二乘？」**

**Because of this, Maitreya again doubts: "When the Buddha rains the Dharma rain, does it only reach bodhisattvas? Does it also moisten the two vehicles?"**

**文殊即以第四偈斷云：「諸求三乘人，若有疑悔者，佛當為除斷，令盡無有餘。」此即斷其疑用之問。**

**Manjuśrī immediately cuts it off with the fourth verse, saying: "All those seeking the three vehicles—if they have doubts and regrets—the Buddha will remove and cut them off, causing them to be exhausted with none remaining." This cuts off the doubt about the function.**

**彌勒聯翩構疑，文殊頻煩為斷，既事窮理盡即得之於懷，可謂善於問答，具二莊嚴。**

**Maitreya continuously constructs doubts; Manjuśrī repeatedly troubles himself to cut them off. When events are exhausted and principle is brought to completion, it is obtained in the heart. One could say he is skilled in question-and-answer and complete in the two adornments.**

**光宅但知述於釗師釋四種伏難，使文殊必答，顯彌勒之美；不見文殊釋四伏疑，令彌勒不問，抑妙德之能。**

**Guangzhai only knows to recount Master Zhao's explanation of the four latent difficulties, causing Manjuśrī certainly to answer, thereby displaying Maitreya's excellence; he does not see Manjuśrī explaining the four latent doubts and causing Maitreya not to ask, thereby restraining Wonderfully Virtuous' ability.**

**此義出自天台，非傳他疏。**

**This meaning comes from Tiantai; it is not transmitted from other commentaries.**

**寄語後賢勿遏人長也，自釗師已後，數百年中，講《法華》者溢路，頗有見斯意不非長何(謂也)？**

**I send a message to later worthies: do not stifle others' strengths. Since after Master Zhao, over several hundred years, lecturers on the *Lotus* have overflowed the roads—how many have ever seen this meaning and not stifled strengths (so to speak)?**

**釋方便品**

**Interpreting the Chapter on Skillful Means.**

**○釋此有略、廣。略為二：先、略，次、料簡。**

**Explaining this has a brief and a broad [treatment]. The brief has two parts: first, the brief [explanation]; next, the analytical discrimination.**

**「方」者法也，「便」者用也；法有方圓，用有差會；三權是矩、是方，一實是規、是圓。**

**"Fāng" is dharma; "biàn" is function. Dharmas have square and round; functions have differences and meetings. The three provisionals are the carpenter's square—square; the one real is the compass—round.**

**若智詣於矩，則善用偏法逗會眾生；若智詣於規，則善用圓法逗會眾生。**

**If wisdom reaches the square, then one skillfully uses partial dharmas to meet beings. If wisdom reaches the compass, then one skillfully uses perfect dharmas to meet beings.**

**譬如偏舉指以目偏處，是舉偏法以目智，宜用法以釋方，將用以釋便。**

**It is like raising a finger to point to a partial place: this is raising partial dharmas to point to wisdom. It is fitting to use dharma to explain "fāng" and to use function to explain "biàn."**

**若總舉指以目圓處，宜將祕以釋方，妙以釋便也。**

**If one generally raises the finger to point to a round place, it is fitting to take "secret" to explain "fāng" and "wondrous" to explain "biàn."**

**舉偏法釋方便，蓋隨眾生欲，非佛本懷，如經令離諸著出三界苦，是故如來殷勤稱歎方便。此義可釋他經，非今品意。**

**To raise partial dharmas to explain skillful means is to follow beings' desires, not the Buddha's original intent—like the sutras that cause one to depart from attachments and leave the suffering of the three realms. Therefore the Tathāgata earnestly praises skillful means. This meaning can explain other sutras; it is not the intent of this chapter.**

**又方便者，門也，門名能通，通於所通，方便權略皆是哢引，為真實作門，真實得顯，功由方便，從能顯得名，故以門釋方便，如經：「開方便門示真實相」，此義可釋他經，非今品意。**

**Further, skillful means are a "gate." A gate is named for its ability to pass through, passing through to what it passes through. Skillful means, the provisional, and the abridged are all coaxing inducements, making a gate for the real. When the real is revealed, the merit is due to skillful means. Because it can reveal, it gains the name; therefore one uses "gate" to explain skillful means, as the sutra says: "Opening the gate of skillful means, it reveals the real marks." This meaning can explain other sutras; it is not the intent of this chapter.**

**又方者祕也，便者妙也，妙達於方即是真祕，點內衣裏無價之珠，與王頂上唯有一珠，無二無別；指客作人是長者子亦無二無別，如斯之言，是祕、是妙，如經：「唯我知是相，十方佛亦然」「止止不須說，我法妙難思。」**

**Further, "fāng" is secret and "biàn" is wondrous. When wondrousness reaches secrecy, it is true secrecy. Pointing out the priceless pearl sewn in the lining of one's clothing is not different from the single pearl on the king's crown—no two, no difference. Pointing out that the hired laborer is the elder's son is also no two, no difference. Words like these are secret and wondrous, as the sutra says: "Only I know this mark; the buddhas of the ten directions are also thus," and: "Stop, stop—no need to speak; my Dharma is wondrous and difficult to conceive."**

**故以祕釋方，以妙釋便，正是今品之意，故言方便品也。**

**Therefore, taking secret to explain "fāng" and wondrous to explain "biàn" is precisely the intent of this chapter; therefore it is called the Chapter on Skillful Means.**

**料簡者，初番釋者是體外方便，化物之權隨他意語；次釋亦是體外方便，自行化他之權，亦是隨自他意語；後釋是同體方便，即是自行權、隨自意語。**

**As for the analytical discrimination: the first explanation is skillful means outside the essence—converting beings through provisionality, following others' intent-words. The next explanation is also skillful means outside the essence: provisionality of self-practice and converting others, also following self-and-others intent-words. The later explanation is skillful means of shared essence: provisionality of self-practice, following one's own intent-words.**

**初釋方便，非能入、非所入；次釋方便，是能入、非所入；後釋方便，是所入、非能入，故知名同，其義大異，世人多不見此意，浪釋「方便品」(云云)。**

**In the first explanation, skillful means are neither what can enter nor what is entered. In the next explanation, skillful means are what can enter but not what is entered. In the later explanation, skillful means are what is entered but not what can enter. Therefore, we know: although the name is the same, its meaning is greatly different. Most people in the world do not see this intent, and they recklessly explain "Skillful Means" (and so on).**

**問：**

**Question:**

**方便與權云何？**

**How are skillful means and provisionality?**

**答：**

**Answer:**

**四句分別：自有方便破權，權破方便；方便修權，權修方便；方便即權，權即方便。**

**They are distinguished in four sentences: there are those in which skillful means break provisionality and provisionality breaks skillful means; skillful means cultivate provisionality and provisionality cultivates skillful means; skillful means are provisionality and provisionality is skillful means; provisionality is skillful means with no two and no difference.**
*[Critical apparatus: [4] 皆【大】，皆是【甲】]*


**方便破權者，四種皆是祕妙之方便，此方便破隨他意，權也；權破方便者，權是同體之權，破於體外之方便也；相修者亦可解，相即者亦可解(云云)。**

**In "skillful means break provisionality": the four kinds are all secret and wondrous skillful means; these skillful means break the provisional of following others' intent. In "provisionality breaks skillful means": provisionality is provisionality of shared essence; it breaks the skillful means outside the essence. As for mutual cultivation, it can also be explained; as for mutual identity, it can also be explained (and so on).**

**三句可釋他經，第四句今品意也，故《正法華》名善權品，權即方便無二無別，低頭、舉手皆成佛道，方便、善權皆真實也。**

**The first three sentences can explain other sutras; the fourth sentence is the intent of this chapter. Therefore, the *Proper Dharma Flower* names it the Chapter of Good Provisionality: provisionality is precisely skillful means, with no two and no difference; lowering the head or raising the hand—all accomplish the Buddha-path. Skillful means and good provisionality are both real.**

**廣釋者，先出舊解五時權實，十二年前，照無常事為權，照無常理為實，指阿毘曇，今謂《釋論》破無常是對治法，皆屬三悉檀，云何有實耶？非今所用。**

**As for the broad explanation: first it presents the old explanation of the five periods' provisional/real. Before the twelve years: illuminating impermanent events is provisional; illuminating impermanent principle is real—pointing to the Abhidharma. Now I say: the *Treatise* breaks impermanence as an antidotal dharma; all belong to the three siddhāntas. How could there be any real? It is not used here.**

**十二年後《般若》照假有為權，照假有即空為實，《釋論》亦破此義，念想觀已除，言語法皆滅，照假有即空者，猶是觀想耳。非今所用。**

**After the twelve years, the Prajñā: illuminating provisional existence is provisional; illuminating that provisional existence is emptiness is real. The *Treatise* also breaks this meaning: once conceptual contemplation is removed, verbal dharmas are all extinguished; illuminating provisional existence as emptiness is still only contemplative ideation. It is not used here.**

**次《淨名》、《思益》，內諍鑒空有二境為實智，外變動應用為權智。今謂內鑒外用為二，非入不二門，非今所用。**

**Next, the *Vimalakīrti* and the *Sīyì*: inward contention takes contemplating the two realms of empty and existent as real wisdom; outward transformations and responsive applications as provisional wisdom. Now I say: inward contemplation and outward function as two is not entering the non-dual gate; it is not used here.**

**次《法華》照三三為權，照四一為實。今謂三權一向不會實，一實不關三權，非今所用。**

**Next, the *Lotus*: illuminating the three threes is provisional; illuminating the four one is real. Now I say: the three provisionals do not, in one direction, meet the real; the one real is not connected to the three provisionals. It is not used here.**

**次《涅槃》金剛前無常為權，金剛後常為實。今謂道前真如亦是常，道後如量智亦是權。此五時權實非今所用，乃至半滿四宗所明權實二智，亦非今所用。**

**Next, the *Nirvāṇa*: before the diamond, impermanence is provisional; after the diamond, permanence is real. Now I say: before the path, suchness is also permanent; after the path, wisdom as-it-is is also provisional. These five periods' provisional/real are not used here; even the two wisdoms of provisional/real as clarified by the four schools of half and full are also not used here.**

**復有人解，方便是權爾，實是審實；又方便是權巧，實是智慧；又方便是權假，假三車於門外；又方便是權宜，宜說三乘故；又權是譬名，譬如秤錘前之則重，却之則輕，處中則平，合於佛智照察稱量。**

**Further, some explain: skillful means are "merely provisional" and the real is "carefully real"; or skillful means are "provisional skill" and the real is "wisdom"; or skillful means are "provisional provisionality," provisionally positing the three carts outside the gate; or skillful means are "provisional suitability," suitable for speaking the three vehicles; or "provisional" is a metaphor-name—like a balance-weight: push it forward and it is heavy; pull it back and it is light; place it in the middle and it is level—matching the Buddha's wisdom in observing and weighing.**

**如是等釋各取一途，權爾、權假約處所，權宜約法門，權巧秤錘約智能，各不包含，義不融妙，不可用此釋今品。**

**Explanations like these each take one route: "merely provisional" and "provisional provisionality" are in terms of location; "provisional suitability" is in terms of dharma-gates; "provisional skill" and "balance-weight" are in terms of wisdom. None includes the others; the meaning does not merge into wondrousness. One cannot use these to explain this chapter.**

**又有人以四種二慧，初一是權、一是實；次空有二智，觀空不證離二乘，涉有無染出凡夫；次空有內靜為實，外用為權；次金剛前後常、無常為權實。**

**Further, some use the four kinds of two wisdoms: first, one is provisional and one is real; next, the two knowledges of empty and existent—contemplating emptiness without realizing it departs from the two vehicles, engaging existence without defilement departs from ordinary beings; next, inner quiescence of empty and existent is real and outer functioning is provisional; next, permanence/impermanence before/after the diamond are provisional/real.**
*[Critical apparatus: [5] 權【大】，權後【甲】]*


**初二慧令生信，次二慧令生解，次二慧令化他，後二慧是果。**

**The first two wisdoms cause the arising of faith; the next two cause the arising of understanding; the next two cause transforming others; the final two are the fruition.**

**此諸二慧凡有三轉：初以有為俗、空為真；次空有為俗，非空非有為真；次空有為二，非空非有為不二，二不二皆為俗，非二非不二為真，教智亦然，何故爾？為人悉檀故。**

**These two wisdoms have, in general, three turnings: first, taking the existent as conventional and emptiness as true; second, taking empty and existent as conventional and neither empty nor existent as true; third, taking empty and existent as two, neither empty nor existent as non-two; taking both the two and the non-two as conventional, and neither two nor non-two as true. Teaching-wisdom is also so. Why is it so? Because it is the siddhānta for people.**

**自有人聞前不悟，聞後即悟，是故二諦不同。**

**Some people hear the earlier and do not awaken; hearing the later, they awaken. Therefore the two truths are not the same.**

**又如來常依二諦說法，故二諦有三門。又佛教雖多，不出三門。**

**Further, the Tathāgata always relies on the two truths to preach Dharma; therefore the two truths have three gates. Although the Buddha's teachings are many, they do not go beyond these three gates.**

**又漸引眾生故，凡夫計心形是實，蓋非實也，法性空乃真耳，凡夫即捨有取空，故說空有皆是俗，非空非有乃是真。**

**Further, because beings are gradually guided: ordinary people take mind and form to be real—this is not real. Dharma-nature's emptiness is the true. Ordinary people then abandon existence and grasp emptiness; therefore it says both empty and existent are conventional, and neither empty nor existent is true.**

**或者捨二邊復滯中道，故第三遠離二邊不著中道，乃是真。此為五乘人。**

**Or, one abandons the two extremes and again becomes stuck in the middle way. Therefore, the third [gate] is to be far from the two extremes and not attach to the middle way—this is true. This is for the people of the five vehicles.**

**初引凡夫生信出有，次引二乘令入中，次引菩薩令中偏俱捨。**

**First it guides ordinary people to give rise to faith and leave existence; next it guides the two vehicles to enter the middle; next it guides bodhisattvas to abandon both the middle and the partial.**

**又為學中者，謂三假為世，三假空為真。此但得初意。次非三假，空有皆俗，非空非有為真(云云)。**

**Also, for those studying the middle: it says the three provisionals are the worldly, and the emptiness of the three provisionals is true. This only obtains the first intent. Next, it is not the three provisionals: empty and existent are both conventional, and neither empty nor existent is true (and so on).**

**今詳彼釋，乃是傍五時顯己意，却漸次梯隥之非耳，可釋他經，非今品意。**

**Now, examining those explanations in detail: they are merely relying on the five periods to display their own intent, rejecting the error of gradual step-ladders. They can explain other sutras; they are not the intent of this chapter.**

**經云：「咸令眾生皆得覩見」，何時前後開悟不同？**

**The sutra says: "All cause beings to gain seeing." When is there any difference of opening and awakening between earlier and later?**

**又云：「正直捨方便」，那用漸次會於圓妙？**

**And it says: "Straightforwardly abandon skillful means"—how could one use gradual steps to meet the perfect wondrous?**

**又初引生信解化果等，何關今經悟入之意耶？**

**And the initial guiding into faith, understanding, transformation, fruition, and so on—how does that relate to this sutra's intent of awakening and entering?**

**如天親列十七名，第十三名大巧方便。又《大乘方便經》明方便十種，第九名善巧，移二乘令入大乘方便波羅蜜，當知今品乃是如來方便攝一切法，如空包色、若海納流，豈可以諸師一枝、一派釋法界之大都耶？**

**As Vasubandhu lists seventeen names, the thirteenth is called Great Skillful Means. And the *Mahāyāna Skillful Means Sutra* clarifies ten kinds of skillful means; the ninth is named "skillful," shifting the two vehicles and causing them to enter the Mahāyāna skillful-means pāramitā. One should know: this chapter is the Tathāgata's skillful means that gather all dharmas—like empty space containing form, like the ocean receiving streams. How could one use the one branch and one faction of various masters to explain the great capital of the dharma-realm?**

**今明權實者，先作四句：謂一切法皆權，一切法皆實，一切法亦權亦實，一切法非權非實。**

**Now, clarifying provisional and real: first make four sentences: (1) all dharmas are provisional; (2) all dharmas are real; (3) all dharmas are both provisional and real; (4) all dharmas are neither provisional nor real.**
*[Critical apparatus: [1] 不分卷【甲】]*


**一切法權者，如文云：「諸法如是性、相、體、力、本、末等」，介爾有言皆是權也。**

**As for "all dharmas are provisional": as the text says, "Dharmas are such in nature, mark, essence, power, root, and end, etc." Even the slightest utterance is all provisional.**

**一切法實者，如文：「如來巧說諸法，悅可眾心」，眾心以入實為悅。**

**As for "all dharmas are real": as the text says, "The Tathāgata skillfully speaks the dharmas, pleasing the minds of the multitude." The minds of the multitude take entering the real as what pleases them.**

**又「諸法從本來，常自寂滅相」又云：「如來所說，皆悉到於一切智地」又云：「皆實不虛」，又大經四句皆不可說也。**

**Also: "Dharmas from the root onward are always of the mark of quiescent extinction." And it also says: "What the Tathāgata says all arrives at the ground of all-wisdom." And it also says: "All are real and not false." And in the Mahāparinirvāṇa [sutra], the four sentences are all unspeakable.**

**一切法亦權亦實者，如文所謂「諸法如實相」，是雙明一切亦權亦實，例如不淨觀，亦實亦虛(云云)。**

**As for "all dharmas are both provisional and real": as the text says, "Dharmas are like the real marks." This doubly clarifies that all are both provisional and real—for example, in contemplation of impurity, it is both real and false (and so on).**

*Words and Phrases of the Lotus Sutra*, Fascicle 3, Part 1 [End].

### [SCHOLARLY APPARATUS]

**Fascicle 3 Part 1:** Covers the commentary on the latter half of the "Introduction Chapter" of the *Lotus Sutra*, focusing on the Q&A between Maitreya and Manjuśrī.

[^1]: **62 Lines:** Refers to the Chinese verse structure (4 characters/lines per stanza).

[^2]: **Vibhāṣā/Da Zhi Du Lun:** (*Pí Pó Shā*) Traditionally attributed to the *Mahāvibhāṣā Śāstra*, but often refers to the *Dà Zhì Dù Lùn* (T1509) in Zhiyi’s usage when discussing Mahāyāna concepts. Scholarly consensus varies on specific attributions without direct citation.

[^3]: **Vairocana (*Lúshěnuó*):** The "Reward Body" (*Sambhogakāya*) Buddha. In Tiantai, Vairocana represents the glorious, ubiquitous body of the Buddha formed by merits, distinct from the physical *Śākyamuni* (*Nirmāṇakāya*) and the abstract Principle *Birushana* (*Dharmakāya*).

[^4]: **Seven Locations and Nine Assemblies:** The traditional structure of the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*, where the Buddha (as Vairocana) preaches in seven different locations (Bodhimanda, Universal Light Hall, Trayastriṃśa Heaven, etc.) over nine assemblies.

[^5]: **First Principle Patience:** *Paramārtha-kṣānti*. The highest patience, which endures the non-arising of dharmas (*Anutpattika-dharma-kṣānti*) and seeks the ultimate Buddha Way, transcending mere endurance of suffering.

[^6]: **Five vs. Six Superknowledges:** The Six *Abhijñā* are: 1. Divine Eye, 2. Divine Ear, 3. Knowledge of Others' Minds, 4. Past Lives, 5. Psychic Travel, 6. Extinction of Outflows (*Āsravakṣaya*). Ordinary beings and lesser Bodhisattvas lack the 6th (Extinction of Outflows); therefore, they are said to have only Five. The Perfect Bodhisattva possesses all Six.

[^7]: **Sīyì:** *Viśeṣacintī-brahma-paripṛcchā Sūtra* (Sutra of the Questions of Excellent Thought Brahma), translated by Kumārajīva. It is a key Vaipulya text discussing the non-duality of the Bodhisattva path.

[^8]: **Pārijāta:** The "Coral Tree" or "Tree of Heaven," growing in the Trayastriṃśa Heaven. Its fragrance perfumes the entire heaven, symbolizing the pervasive power of merit.

[^9]: **Latent Difficulties (*Fú Nàn*):** An exegetical device where the commentator assumes an unasked question or hidden doubt ("Difficulty") lies behind the text's surface structure. The transmission from **Master Zhao of Jiangbei** to **Guangzhai Fayun** shows this was an established method in the Southern traditions before Zhiyi.

[^10]: **Master Yáo:** Likely referring to **Sengyou** or **Daoyou**, prominent exegetes of the Nirvana/Satysiddhi tradition who emphasized the "Depending/Entrusting" meaning of *Yīn*.

[^11]: **First Abode / Breaking Ignorance:** Corresponds to the **Six Stages of Identity** (*Liù Jí Fó*). At each stage (Reason, Name, Practice, Semblance, True Fraction, Ultimate), a layer of Ignorance is broken. The "First Abode" corresponds to the Stage of True Fraction (*Fēn Zhèng Jí*), where one starts to break fundamental Ignorance and reveal the Dharma Body.

[^12]: **Sun Moon Lamp Bright:** Sanskrit **Candrasūryapradīpa**. A past Buddha name symbolizing the Three Wisdoms: Sun (All-Knowledge/Compassion), Moon (Path Wisdom), Lamp (All-Modes Wisdom/Breaking Darkness).

[^13]: **Omen Correspondence:** Zhiyi here correlates the *Past* Omen of Raining Flowers with the *Present* Omen of **Expounding Dharma**, and the *Past* Earth Shaking with the *Present* **Assembly Rejoicing**. This differs from the direct "Flowers-to-Flowers" correspondence seen in the earlier "Thinking Answer," illustrating the fluidity of the Six Omens in the "Broad" view where all omens interpenetrate.

[^14]: **Wonderfully Bright (*Miào Guāng*):** Or *Varaprabha*. The past incarnation of **Manjuśrī**, showing his role as the teacher of past Buddhas, including Maitreya (Fame Seeker).

[^15]: **Critical Apparatus:** 不分卷【甲】 — "Does not divide fascicles." The Jiaxing edition (甲) does not mark the division between upper/lower parts at this point in the fascicle.
