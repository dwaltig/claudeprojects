**從「餘失心者」下，譬上非滅現滅。上有二：一、不久應死，譬上非滅現滅；二、諸子醒悟，譬上唱滅利益。又唱死之由，由子不服，譬上薄德見佛常在但增憍恣。上現滅中有二：一、本實不滅，二、非滅唱滅，不出現滅之由由，亦是唱滅利益中。今譬不譬第一，而明現滅之由，正由眾生薄德見佛不修行，即是不肯服藥也。「我今當設」下，正唱應死，譬非滅唱滅。此中明衰老為二：一、擬宜去住，譬上住有損、滅有益；二、「即作是言」下，唱應死，正譬現滅化期將竟也。「死時已至」者，當入涅槃也。留經教在，故云「是好良藥今留在此」。「復至他國」者，即是此方現滅、他方現生，上文云「願在他方遙見守護」，即其義也。「遣使」者，或取涅槃中大聲普告為使人，或用神通，或用舍利，或用經教等為使人，今用四依菩薩語眾生云佛已滅度，但留此法我今宣弘，汝當受行也。後時眾生若無四依傳述經法，豈能自知佛已滅度？故用四依是使人也。二、「是時諸子」下，諸子醒悟譬現滅利益。上文有二：一、明損益，二、釋損益，今但譬得益。此中「自惟孤露」下，明滅後得益，如優波笈多所化之流也。又為二：一、現滅利益，二、是未來機感。良由滅後眾生醒悟服藥修行以作因緣，能感未來應化，如《遺教》云「其未度者作得度因緣」；亦有現得感見，《普賢觀》云「精進苦到得見釋迦分身、多寶、東力、善德等及七佛世尊」。第三，「其父聞子悉已得差」下，即是未來益物威猛之力。父聞子差即機咸使見之，即是起未來之應化，方將形聲兩益也，如文。從「諸善男子於意云何」下，牒不虛譬，明三世利益不虛也。從「佛言我亦如是」去，明合譬也。「成佛已來無量劫」者，合過去世也。「方便力言當滅度」，合現在世也。文略不合未來，亦無能說我虛妄，合益物不虛也。**

**From “the remaining sons who had lost their minds” downward, it parables the above non-extinction manifesting extinction. Above there are two: (1) “they should soon die,” parabling non-extinction manifesting extinction; (2) the sons awaken, parabling the benefits of proclaiming extinction. The reason for proclaiming death is that the sons do not take the medicine--this parables the above “thin virtue,” seeing the Buddha constantly present yet only increasing arrogance. In the above manifesting-extinction there are two: (1) the origin is truly not extinct, (2) non-extinction proclaiming extinction. This is not beyond the reasons for manifesting extinction, and is also within the benefits of proclaiming extinction. Here the parable does not parable the first, but clarifies the reason for manifesting extinction: precisely because beings of thin virtue see the Buddha and do not practice--this is the refusal to take the medicine. From “now I will set up” downward, it directly proclaims impending death, parabling non-extinction proclaiming extinction. Here the decline is clarified in two: (1) indicating what is appropriate for going or staying, parabling that abiding is harmful and extinction is beneficial; (2) from “then he said thus,” proclaiming death, directly parabling that the period of manifesting-extinction transformation is about to end. “The time of death has arrived” means he is about to enter nirvāṇa. He leaves the teachings behind; therefore he says, “This good medicine I now leave here.” “Again he goes to another country” means: in this land he manifests extinction, in another land he manifests birth; above it said, “I vow to be in another land, remotely seeing and protecting”--that is its meaning. “Dispatching messengers”: some take the great voice in nirvāṇa that universally proclaims as the messenger; others use spiritual powers, relics, or scriptures and teachings as the messenger. Here he uses the bodhisattvas of the Four Reliances to tell beings that the Buddha has already entered extinction, and only this Dharma remains; I now proclaim it--receive and practice it. If later beings lacked the Four Reliances to transmit the scripture and Dharma, how could they know by themselves that the Buddha has entered extinction? Therefore the Four Reliances are used as messengers. Second, from “at that time the sons…” the sons awaken, parabling the benefit of manifesting extinction. Above there are two: (1) clarifying harm and benefit, (2) explaining harm and benefit; here it only parables gaining benefit. From “they themselves considered their loneliness” downward, it clarifies the benefit gained after extinction, as in the example of those transformed by Upagupta. Again there are two: (1) the benefit of manifesting extinction, (2) the future capacity-response. Because after extinction beings awaken, take the medicine, and practice as causes and conditions, they can elicit the future response-transformation. As the *Bequeathed Teachings* says, “Those not yet saved become causes and conditions for being saved.” There are also present attainments that elicit a vision; the *Samantabhadra Contemplation* says, “By diligent austerities to the end, one obtains vision of Śākyamuni’s emanations, Many Treasures, Dongli, Shande, and the Seven Buddhas, World-Honored Ones.” Third, from “the father, hearing that the sons had all been cured,” this is the mighty power of future benefit for beings. The father hearing the sons are cured means the capacities all cause him to make them see--this is the arousal of future response-transformation, which then brings the two benefits of form and sound, as in the text. From “Good sons, what do you think?” downward, it references the parable of not-false, clarifying that the benefits for beings through the three times are not false. From “the Buddha said, I am also thus” onward, it clarifies the matching of the parable. “Since I became Buddha, innumerable kalpas” matches the past time. “By the power of expedients he says he will enter extinction” matches the present time. The text does not explicitly match the future, yet there is no one who can say I am false--this matches the benefit of beings not being false.**

**The verse has twenty-five and a half lines, praising the above dharma-parable. The first twenty and a half lines praise the dharma-explanation; the next five lines praise the parable-explanation. The above dharma-explanation has two; the verse also has two: first, nineteen and a half lines praise benefiting beings in the three times; next, one line praises that all are truly not false. The first four lines, praising past benefit, have three: first, one line praises that attainment of the Way was long ago; next, from “constantly preaching the Dharma,” second, one line praises the benefit during the middle period; next, from “in order to deliver beings,” third, two lines praise the dwelling place. Next, from “beings see me,” second, five lines praise the present. The above text has two: the first two and a half lines praise non-birth manifesting birth; next, from “at that time I say,” second, two and a half lines praise non-extinction manifesting extinction. Next, from “I see all,” third, ten and a half lines praise the future. Above it only relied on the four words “constantly abiding, not extinguished”; here the verse is expansive. The text has four parts: first, from “I see,” one and a half lines clarify future capacity-response. Next, from “the power of spiritual penetrations is thus,” second, four lines praise the above constant abiding and non-extinction. “Always on Vulture Peak” refers to the true-reward land; “and other dwelling places” refers to the expedient-with-remainder lands, i.e., the “other lands” above. “Gods and humans fill it” means the thirty minds are “humans,” the ten grounds are “gods.” “Striking the heavenly drums” means preaching without being asked. “Māndārava flowers” refers to the ranks of sages and saints. Next, from “my pure land,” third, two lines clarify the conditions for not seeing. Next, from “those who cultivate merit,” fourth, three lines clarify the conditions for seeing. Next, from “you who have wisdom,” second, one line praises the above benefit as not false.**

**次，五行，頌譬，為二：一行頌開譬，為三：初一句，頌過去；「為治」下二句，頌現在，不頌未來也，「無能說」下，第三，一句，頌不虛。「後我亦為」下，第二，四行，頌合譬。上合中本不合未來，今初半行頌合過去；次「凡夫」下，第二，二行半，頌合現在；後「每自作」下，第三，一行，頌合不虛，開三顯一、開近顯遠，欲令眾生速入佛道，此事必得不虛也。**

**Next, five lines praise the parable, in two parts: one line praises the opening parable, in three: the first phrase praises the past; the next two phrases from “to cure” praise the present (not the future); the third phrase from “none can say” praises that it is not false. From “afterward I also” downward, second, four lines praise the matching parable. In the matching above, the future was not matched; here the first half line praises the past matching; next, from “ordinary beings,” second, two and a half lines praise the present matching; last, from “each himself makes,” third, one line praises the not-false matching. It opens the three and reveals the one, opens the near and reveals the far, wishing to cause beings to swiftly enter the Buddha-way--this matter must be not false.**

**釋分別功德品**

**Explanation of the "Distinguishing Merits" Chapter**

---

**佛說壽量，二世弟子得種種益，故言「功德」，淺深不同故，言「分別品」也。此文是本門第二授記段，論分此文，有法力、修行力。法力者有五：一證，二信，三供養，皆如今品，四聞法，如〈隨喜品〉，五讀誦持說，讀誦如〈法師功德品〉，持者追指〈法師〉、〈安樂行〉、〈勸持〉三品，說者如〈神力〉、〈囑累品〉也。修行力者，苦行力如〈藥王〉，教化如〈妙音〉，護難如〈觀音〉、〈陀羅尼〉，示功德如〈妙莊嚴王〉，護法如〈普賢品〉也。光宅云：「一約功德門，記其行進現在修因；二約智慧門，記其損生未來得果；三明外凡發心，夫授記通因果，此三通是授記耳。下八世界發心，應在初列，以外凡聞經發心住三十心；三十心聞經始出內凡登於初地得無生忍；初地聞經進入二地得聞持；二地聞經得入三地，名樂說辯；三地聞經入四地，得無量旋；四地聞經入五地，名不退；五地入六地，名清淨輪，小千已去約損生門授記；七地已斷無明惑，惑有九品，能為九生作因；從七地已上，果報無有期限，難可得判，但斷九品煩惱為言。煩惱品數百千萬種，今約一種九品作義。七地所斷，作下上二品，乃至十地所斷，亦作上下二品，金剛心所斷作一品，六地聞經登七地下忍斷一品，所餘八品在，為八生作因，故云八生當得菩提。七地上忍復斷一品，即損二品生，餘七品為七生作因，七生當得菩提。諸品例有上下，一品盡損一生，文略，故從八地乃至四生，餘有一生，即金剛心斷之法也。」《法華論》云「得無生忍者，謂入初地證智，應知從八生乃至一生得菩提者，謂諸凡夫決定能證初地隨分生及一生則證菩提。菩提者，離三界分段生死，隨分能見真如佛性，名得菩提，非謂究竟滿足菩提。」今謂《論》前深後淺，光宅前淺後深，二彼相拒世孰判之？夫無生法忍經論不同，迦旃延子明五法成就獲不退轉，六度菩薩位也；須陀洹若智若斷是菩薩無生法忍者，三乘共位也；登初地得無生忍者，別菩薩位也；登初住得無生法忍者，圓菩薩位也。皆聖教明文，不可參濫。又《淨名》「近無等等得無生忍」，《仁王》云「至金剛頂皆名伏忍，亦名寂滅忍」，蓋是別、圓。地地，通途之意不可定用。即光宅以發心為內凡，三十心位為無生忍，是初地，皆別家名教非通家門戶；從初地至六地，呼為福德門，《大經》稱有為有漏，名聲聞僧，則通教意耳；七地已上斷九品生因者，小乘大乘得入位人，誰不斷惑未足定判，若言七地斷無明者，非通又非別，乃是別接通意耳。光宅游漾，不會今經。天親以發心為無生忍，從八生至一生，凡夫決定斷果報生盡得入初地，獲無生忍者，專據別義，亦不會經。**

**The Buddha speaks of the lifespan; disciples of the two ages obtain various benefits, therefore it is called “merits and virtues.” Because the shallow and deep differ, it is called the “Distinguishing Merits” chapter. This passage is the second prediction section of the Fundamental Gate. In analyzing it, there are the power of Dharma and the power of practice. The power of Dharma has five: (1) realization, (2) faith, (3) offerings--all as in this chapter; (4) hearing the Dharma, as in the “Rejoicing” chapter; (5) reading, reciting, upholding, and teaching. Reading and reciting are as in the “Merits of the Dharma Teacher” chapter; upholding points back to the three chapters “Dharma Teacher,” “Peaceful Practices,” and “Encouraging Upholding”; teaching is as in the “Spiritual Powers” and “Entrustment” chapters. The power of practice: the power of austerities is as in “Medicine King”; teaching and transforming is as in “Wonderful Sound”; protecting in adversity is as in “Avalokiteśvara” and “Dharani”; displaying merits is as in “Wonderful Adornment King”; protecting the Dharma is as in the “Samantabhadra” chapter. Guangzhai says: “First, by the gate of merits, it records their practice advancing and their present cultivation of causes. Second, by the gate of wisdom, it records their reduction of births and their future attainment of the fruit. Third, it clarifies the arousing of resolve by outer ordinary beings. Predictions encompass causes and fruits; these three are all predictions. The arousing of resolve in the lower eight worlds should be placed in the first category, because outer ordinary beings hear the sutra, arouse resolve, and abide in the thirty minds. Those in the thirty minds, hearing the sutra, first leave the inner-ordinary stage and ascend to the first ground, attaining the patience of non-arising. At the first ground, hearing the sutra advances into the second ground and attains retention. At the second ground, hearing the sutra enters the third ground, called joyful eloquence. At the third ground, hearing the sutra enters the fourth ground and attains immeasurable turning. At the fourth ground, hearing the sutra enters the fifth ground, called non-retrogression. The fifth ground enters the sixth ground, called the Pure Wheel; from the small thousand-world system on, predictions are in terms of the gate of reducing births. At the seventh ground one has already cut off ignorance-delusions; delusions have nine grades and can serve as causes for nine births. From the seventh ground and above, the retribution has no fixed limit and is difficult to judge; therefore we speak only in terms of cutting the nine grades of affliction. The grades of affliction are in the hundreds of thousands of myriad kinds; here we take one set of nine grades as the meaning. What is cut at the seventh ground becomes the lower and upper two grades; up through what is cut at the tenth ground also becomes the lower and upper two grades; what the Vajra Mind cuts is one grade. At the sixth ground, hearing the sutra and ascending to the seventh ground’s lower patience cuts one grade; the remaining eight grades remain and serve as causes for eight births, therefore it is said that in eight births one will attain bodhi. The upper patience of the seventh ground again cuts one grade, thus reducing two grades of births; the remaining seven grades serve as causes for seven births, and in seven births one will attain bodhi. By analogy, all grades have upper and lower; one grade fully reduces one birth. The text is brief; therefore, from the eighth ground to four births, with one birth remaining, this is the method of the Vajra Mind cutting.” The *Treatise on the Lotus Sutra* says, “Those who attain the patience of non-arising are those who enter the first ground and realize wisdom. You should know that ‘from eight births down to one birth one attains bodhi’ means that ordinary beings definitively can realize the first ground: in a partial birth and in one birth they then realize bodhi. Bodhi means leaving the segmented birth-and-death of the three realms and, in accordance with one’s portion, being able to see true suchness Buddha-nature; it is called attaining bodhi, not the ultimate complete bodhi.” Now I say: the Treatise is deep at first and shallow later; Guangzhai is shallow at first and deep later. The two oppose each other--who in the world can judge this? The patience of non-arising is not the same in sutras and treatises: Kātyāyana’s son clarifies that by fulfilling five dharmas one attains non-retrogression--this is the six-perfection bodhisattva stage. A stream-enterer’s wisdom and cutting being the bodhisattva’s patience of non-arising is a stage shared by the three vehicles. Attaining the patience of non-arising upon reaching the first ground is the Distinct bodhisattva stage. Attaining the patience of non-arising upon reaching the first abiding is the Perfect bodhisattva stage. These are all explicit statements of the holy teachings and cannot be mixed together. Moreover, the *Vimalakirti* says, “Near to unequalled, one attains the patience of non-arising.” The *Renwang* says, “Up to the Vajra Summit, all are called subduing patience, also called quiescent-extinction patience.” These are the Distinct and Perfect. The intent of the grounds is not fixed for common usage. Thus Guangzhai takes the arousing of resolve as the inner-ordinary stage, and the thirty-mind stage as the patience of non-arising, calling it the first ground--these are names and teachings of the Distinct school, not the gateways of the Common school. From the first to the sixth ground he calls it the gate of merits; the *Great Sutra* calls it conditioned and tainted, naming it the śrāvaka saṅgha--this is the Common teaching intent. For those above the seventh ground who cut the nine grades of birth-causation, whether those who have entered the stages in the Small or Great Vehicle do not cut off delusions is not yet decisive. If one says the seventh ground cuts ignorance, it is neither Common nor Distinct, but is the Distinct taking up the Common intent. Guangzhai drifts about and does not understand this sutra. Vasubandhu takes the arousing of resolve as the patience of non-arising; from eight births to one birth, ordinary beings definitively cut off retributive births and enter the first ground, attaining the patience of non-arising--this is exclusively based on the Distinct meaning and also does not accord with the sutra.**

**今分文為三：一、經家總序，二、如來分別，三、時眾供養。**

**Now we divide the text into three: (1) the sutra-compilers’ general preface, (2) the Tathāgata’s distinguishing, (3) the offerings of the assembly at that time.**

---

**總序如文。**

**The general preface is as in the text.**

---

**分別者，佛語圓妙，不可用權位釋經，故上文開示悟入佛之知見，今本門增道損生皆約圓位解釋。下八世界發心者，六根清淨人，初入十信位也，故《仁王》云「十善菩薩發大心，長別三界苦輪海」，即此義也。得無生忍，入十住位也，故《華嚴》云「初發心住，一發一切發，得如來一身無量身，清淨妙法身，湛然應一切」，即此義也。得聞持陀羅尼，入十行位也。得樂說辯才，入十迴向位也。得無量旋陀羅尼，入初地也。得不退，入二地也。得清淨，入三地也。八生，入四地也。七生，入五地也。六生，入六地也。五生，入七地也。四生，入八地也。三生，入九地也。二生，入十地也。一生，入等覺金剛心。若論增道損生，不如光宅斷因生之生，不如天親斷果報之生，但約智德論增、約斷德論損，約法身論生、約無明論滅。例如《大經》月喻，從初一日至十五日光色漸增，從十六日至三十日光色漸減，約一月體而論增減，喻約法身而論智斷。或可一人一時有八番增，或可一世，或八世，或無量世；或可一念，或可八念，或無量念；或可眾微塵數，人亦如是，是故不可以因生果生局之，不可離張智斷釋之。然本門得道數倍眾經，非但數多又熏修日久，元本垂迹處處開引，中間相值數數成熟，今世五味節節調伏，收羅結撮歸會《法華》。譬如田家，春生夏長耕種耘治，秋收冬藏一時穫刈。自《法華》已後有得道者，如捃拾耳。**

**As for the distinguishing: the Buddha’s words are perfect and wondrous, and the sutra must not be interpreted with provisional stages; therefore above it opened, revealed, awakened, and entered the Buddha’s knowledge and vision. In the Fundamental Gate, the increase of the Path and the reduction of births are all explained according to Perfect stages. Those in the lower eight worlds who arouse resolve are persons whose six roots are purified, first entering the ten-faith stage; thus the *Renwang* says, “The ten-good bodhisattvas arouse the great mind, long separated from the bitter wheel-ocean of the three realms,” which is this meaning. Attaining the patience of non-arising enters the ten-abidings stage; thus the *Avatamsaka* says, “In the first abiding of arousing the mind, with one arousal all arousals are aroused; one attains the Tathāgata’s one body as immeasurable bodies, the pure wondrous Dharma-body, serenely responding to all,” which is this meaning. Attaining the dharani of retention enters the ten-practices stage. Attaining joyful eloquence enters the ten-transferences stage. Attaining the dharani of immeasurable turning enters the first ground. Attaining non-retrogression enters the second ground. Attaining purity enters the third ground. Eight births enter the fourth ground. Seven births enter the fifth ground. Six births enter the sixth ground. Five births enter the seventh ground. Four births enter the eighth ground. Three births enter the ninth ground. Two births enter the tenth ground. One birth enters the Equal Enlightenment Vajra Mind. If we speak of increasing the Path and reducing births, it is not like Guangzhai’s cutting of causal births, nor like Vasubandhu’s cutting of retributive births; rather, we speak of increase in terms of wisdom-virtue and reduction in terms of severing-virtue; in terms of the Dharma-body we speak of birth, and in terms of ignorance we speak of extinction. For example, in the *Great Sutra*’s moon simile: from the first day to the fifteenth, the light and color gradually increase; from the sixteenth to the thirtieth, the light and color gradually decrease. It discusses increase and decrease in terms of the one-month body, and the simile speaks in terms of the Dharma-body for wisdom and severing. It may be that one person at one time has eight turns of increase; it may be one lifetime, or eight lifetimes, or immeasurable lifetimes. It may be one thought, or eight thoughts, or immeasurable thoughts. It may be the number of countless motes of dust--people are also like this. Therefore one must not restrict it by causal births or retributive births, nor explain it apart from the unfolding of wisdom and severing. Yet in the Fundamental Gate the number who attain the Way is many times that of other sutras; it is not only many in number but also long in perfuming and cultivation. From the very origin, traces are cast down, opening and guiding everywhere; in the middle they encounter each other and mature again and again; in this present lifetime the five flavors tame them step by step, gathering and tying them together and bringing them to the Lotus. It is like a farming household: spring gives rise, summer grows, they plow, sow, and weed; in autumn they harvest, in winter they store--and at one time reap. Those who attain the Way after the Lotus are like gleanings.**

**三，時眾供養者，聞深遠法得大饒益，欲報佛恩而設供養；亦是寄事以表領解。上迹門，菩薩亦悟而大事未畢，所以不陳；本門既竟，彌勒總申領解，明諸菩薩執持幡蓋次第而上至于梵天。幡者轉義，蓋者覆義，地者始義，梵者淨義，智斷番番轉，慈悲番番覆，高下深淺不失次第際于梵天，表諸菩薩增道損生，鄰于妙覺極於極淨。若作天親解者，只得初地一番，豈得與此文會耶？**

**Third, the assembly at that time makes offerings: hearing the profound and far-reaching Dharma, they gain great benefit, and wishing to repay the Buddha’s kindness they set up offerings; it also uses the event to symbolize their understanding. In the Trace Gate, the bodhisattvas also awakened but their great task was not yet complete, so it was not stated. Now that the Fundamental Gate is complete, Maitreya sums up his understanding, describing the bodhisattvas holding banners and canopies in order, ascending up to the Brahma heaven. A banner signifies turning; a canopy signifies covering; the ground signifies beginning; Brahma signifies purity. Wisdom and severing turn again and again; compassion and kindness cover again and again. High and low, deep and shallow, the sequence is not lost, reaching to the Brahma heaven--this symbolizes the bodhisattvas’ increase of the Path and reduction of births, neighboring on wondrous enlightenment and reaching the utmost purity. If one makes Vasubandhu’s interpretation, one only obtains a single turn at the first ground; how could it accord with this passage?**

**偈有十九行，分為三：初，二行，頌時眾得解；次，九行，頌如來分別；後，八行，頌時眾供養。「得無量無漏清淨之果報」者，揀異二乘有量故言無量，妙因所感故言清淨，無障礙土故言果報，異二乘無報也。「聞佛壽無量」，此文定判為無量，何得用舊解有量？**

**The verse has nineteen lines, divided into three: first, two lines praise the assembly’s gaining of understanding; next, nine lines praise the Tathāgata’s distinguishing; last, eight lines praise the assembly’s offerings. “Obtaining the immeasurable, undefiled, pure retribution” selects and distinguishes it from the two vehicles: since theirs is limited it is called immeasurable; because it is evoked by a wondrous cause it is called pure; because it is a land without obstructions it is called retribution; this differs from the two vehicles, which have no retribution. “Hearing the Buddha’s lifespan is immeasurable”--this text definitively judges it to be immeasurable; how can one use the old interpretation that it is limited?**

**南師從偈後長行下，屬流通段，引上迹門文殊現在亦是流通；北師以四信弟子現在聞經，判屬正說，從「又如來滅後」下，乃是流通。二家盡可用，今且依南方。**

**The Southern masters, starting from the prose after the verse, classify it as the circulation section, citing the Trace Gate where Mañjuśrī in the present is also circulation. The Northern masters take the four-faith disciples hearing the sutra in the present as belonging to the main exposition, and from “after the Tathāgata’s extinction” downward as circulation.

**從偈後凡十一品半，分為二：一、從此下至〈不輕品〉，明弘經功德深，勸流通；二從〈神力品〉下八品，付囑、流通各復有三：此半品及〈隨喜品〉，明初品因功德，勸流通；二從〈法師功德〉，明初品果功德，勸流通，〈不輕品〉引信毀罪福，證勸流通；後三者〈神力〉、〈囑累〉，囑累流通，〈藥王〉下五品，約化他勸流通，〈普賢〉約自行勸流通。生起者，現在聞經得真似兩解益如上說，若直聞一句而生隨喜，如現在四信格其功德，未來無佛恐人疑福少，故說滅後五品功德也。因功德微密，未若果功德彰灼，故說〈法師功德品〉；因果雙舉，未若引證分明，故說〈不輕〉；雖舉往人，未若現變，故說〈神力〉；雖示神力，未若摩頂付囑，故說〈囑累〉；雖通途囑累，未若示其要術棄身存道，故說〈藥王〉；雖誡能化，未若誡其所化，隨聞法處應生佛想，故說〈妙音觀音〉；若初心弘經，既無神力當依內禁，故說〈陀羅尼〉；復須外護，故說〈嚴王〉、〈普賢〉，聯翩重疊使大法弘通耳。**

**From the prose after the verse there are eleven and a half chapters, divided into two: first, from here down to the “Never Disparaging” chapter, it clarifies that the merits of spreading the sutra are deep, urging circulation; second, from the “Spiritual Powers” chapter down eight chapters, it is entrusting and circulating, each again with three. This half chapter and the “Rejoicing” chapter clarify the cause merits of the first chapter, urging circulation. Second, from the “Merits of the Dharma Teacher” chapter, it clarifies the fruit merits of the first chapter, urging circulation; the “Never Disparaging” chapter cites the sins and blessings of faith and slander, evidencing the exhortation to circulation. The latter three are: “Spiritual Powers” and “Entrustment” are entrustment-circulation; from “Medicine King” downward five chapters exhort circulation in terms of transforming others; “Samantabhadra” exhorts circulation in terms of self-practice. As for why it arises: in the present, hearing the sutra yields the benefits of true and semblance understanding as described above. If one merely hears a single line and gives rise to rejoicing, as in the present four faiths, their merit is measured; in the future, without a Buddha, people may suspect the merit is small, so the five post-extinction grades of merit are taught. The cause merits are subtle and hidden; they are not as manifest as the fruit merits, hence the “Merits of the Dharma Teacher” chapter. Even when cause and fruit are both raised, it is not as clear as adducing proof, hence “Never Disparaging.” Though former persons are cited, it is not as immediate as present transformation, hence “Spiritual Powers.” Though spiritual powers are displayed, it is not as direct as the crown-touching entrustment, hence “Entrustment.” Though there is general entrustment, it is not as much as revealing the essential technique of abandoning the body to preserve the Way, hence “Medicine King.” Though it admonishes those who transform, it is not as much as admonishing those transformed--wherever they hear the Dharma they should generate the thought of the Buddha--hence “Wonderful Sound” and “Avalokiteśvara.” If beginners spread the sutra and lack spiritual powers, they should rely on inner injunctions, hence “Dharani.” Further, they need outer protection, hence “Wonderful Adornment King” and “Samantabhadra.” Linked and layered, it makes the great Dharma widely circulate.**

**就偈後長行為二：一、現在四信，二、滅後五品。云何四信？略解三人、廣說二人、觀成一人、信通四人，故言四信也。四信者，一、一念信解未能演說，二、略解言趣，三、廣為他說，四、深信觀成。初、一念信解，有長行、偈頌。長行有三：一、舉示其人，二、明功德，三、位行不退。今釋一念信解者，謂隨所聞處豁爾開明，隨語而入無有罣礙，信一切法皆是佛法，又信佛法不隔一切法，不得佛法不得一切法，而見一切法亦見佛法，即一而三、即三而一，亦是行於非道通達佛道、行於佛道通達一切道，不得佛道一切道，而通達佛道一切道，無所有而有，而有無所有，非所有非無所有，如門前路通達一切東西南北𢄶無壅礙，眼耳鼻舌身意，凡有所對悉亦如是。無疑曰信，明了曰解，是為一念信解心也。若坐思惟，隨所思惟豁然開悟，通達三諦亦復如是，如是信解名鐵輪位。又一解，未是具足鐵輪，乃是十信之初心，其人未得六根清淨，故非鐵輪正位也。次格量者，先、總論無量；次、格量多少，為二，初舉五度為格量本，般若即是今之正慧，故言「除般若」也。**

**After the verse, the prose has two parts: (1) the four faiths in the present, (2) the five grades after extinction. What are the four faiths? The abbreviated explanation speaks of three persons, the extensive exposition speaks of two persons, the contemplation-complete is one person, and faith encompasses four persons; therefore it is called four faiths. The four faiths are: (1) one-thought faith-and-understanding, unable yet to expound; (2) brief understanding that states the gist; (3) broadly explaining it for others; (4) deep faith with contemplation accomplished. First, one-thought faith-and-understanding has prose and verse. The prose has three: (1) identifying the person, (2) clarifying the merits, (3) the stage and practice are non-retrogressing. Now, to explain one-thought faith-and-understanding: when one hears, the place of hearing suddenly opens in clarity, one enters along the words with no obstruction; one believes all dharmas are Buddha-dharma, and also that Buddha-dharma does not obstruct any dharma. To not obtain Buddha-dharma is to not obtain any dharma, and when seeing all dharmas one also sees Buddha-dharma--the one is the three, the three is the one. It is also to practice the non-path and penetrate the Buddha-path, to practice the Buddha-path and penetrate all paths; not obtaining the Buddha-path or any path, and yet penetrating the Buddha-path and all paths. Having nothing yet having it; having it yet having nothing; neither having nor not having. It is like the road before one’s gate reaching all directions--east, west, south, north--without obstruction. Eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind--whatever they encounter is also like this. To have no doubt is called faith; to be clear is called understanding. This is the mind of one-thought faith-and-understanding. If one sits and contemplates, wherever one contemplates there is sudden awakening; penetrating the three truths is likewise. Such faith-and-understanding is called the iron-wheel stage. Yet this single understanding is not the full iron wheel; it is the initial mind of the ten faiths. Such a person has not yet attained the purification of the six roots, therefore it is not the proper iron-wheel stage. Next, the measurement: first, it generally discusses immeasurable; next it measures the amount in two. First, it raises the five perfections as the basis for measurement; prajna is the present right wisdom, therefore it says “excluding prajna.”**

**問：**

**Question:**

---

**既離般若，則五不名度。**

**If prajna is removed, then the five are not called perfections.**

---

**答：**

**Answer:**

---

**皆為求佛慧盡施戒邊，亦得名度，蓋次第意也。**

**All are for seeking Buddha-wisdom, extending to the edge of generosity and morality; they may also be called perfections--this is the sequential sense.**

---

**「以是功德」下，第二，正格多少也。「若善男子」下，第三，明位行不退。別六心猶退七心不退，圓初住心即不退，聞壽量功德自外而資，圓順信解自內而熏所以不退。《大品》云「有菩薩退有不退」，有魔無魔皆此義也。**

**From “with these merits” downward, second, it measures the amount directly. From “if a good man” downward, third, it clarifies that the stage and practice are non-retrogressing. In the Distinct teaching the sixth mind still retrogresses, the seventh mind does not retrogress; in the Perfect teaching, the first abiding mind does not retrogress. Hearing the merits of the lifespan, one is aided from without; perfect and compliant faith-and-understanding is perfumed from within--therefore there is no retrogression. The *Great Prajna* says, “There are bodhisattvas who retrogress and those who do not retrogress”; with or without māras this is the meaning.**

**偈十九行半，初十二行，先頌格量多少；次，二行，追頌人相；後五行半，頌行位不退。「無量劫行道」者，久修諸度也。「願我於未來」者，起慈悲願也。藉久行願聞經信解，今之初品始聞此經一念信解，功等久行亦乃過之也。**

**The verse has nineteen and a half lines: the first twelve lines first praise the measurement of amount; next, two lines follow with praise of the persons; the last five and a half lines praise the non-retrogression of practice and stage. “Practicing the Way for immeasurable kalpas” means long cultivation of the perfections. “May I in the future” means arousing the compassionate vow. Relying on long practice and vows, hearing the sutra one gains faith-and-understanding; the first grade now, hearing this sutra and giving rise to one-thought faith-and-understanding, has merit equal to long practice and even surpasses it.**

**“Again, Ajita, hearing that the Buddha’s lifespan is long and remote” is the second grade. Previously there was only faith-and-understanding without being able to expound; explanation involves names and numbers and requires skillful expression. In this grade it is complete, therefore it is said to explain for others. Taking the superior recipient as the name, it is called the second grade. Because of the power of explanation, one can arouse supreme wisdom in self and others. This text first marks the person, then measures the amount.**

---

**「何況廣聞此經」下，第三品，廣聞廣解，廣為他說，廣修供養，供養外資令內智疾入能生一切種智。先出人相，次格量也。**

**From “How much more one who widely hears this sutra” downward is the third grade: widely hearing, widely understanding, widely explaining for others, widely cultivating offerings; offerings aid from without and cause inner wisdom to enter swiftly, able to generate all-seed wisdom. It first states the person, then measures the amount.**

---

**「阿逸多」下，第四，人備上三品加修觀行，入禪用慧想成相起，能見有餘、實報兩土相貌。「見佛共比丘僧常在耆山」者，方便有餘土相也；「又見娑婆純諸菩薩」者，實報相也。初二品是聞慧位，廣聞廣說是思慧位，觀行想成是修慧位，自淺之深成六根清淨十信位也。**

**From “Ajita” downward is the fourth: the person completes the three grades above and adds cultivation of contemplative practice, entering dhyana and using wisdom; once the contemplations are completed and images arise, one can see the appearances of the expedient-with-remainder and true-reward lands. “Seeing the Buddha together with the bhikṣu saṅgha always on Vulture Peak” is the appearance of the expedient-with-remainder land; “again seeing the Sahā world filled with bodhisattvas” is the appearance of the true-reward land. The first two grades are the stage of hearing-wisdom; widely hearing and widely explaining is the stage of thinking-wisdom; contemplative practice completed is the stage of cultivating-wisdom--from shallow to deep, it becomes the ten-faith stage with purified six roots.**

**問：**

**Question:**

---

**何故爾？**

**Why so?**

---

**答：**

**Answer:**

---

**四品粗格量，初品廣格量，廣格量已況出勝者可以意得，佛不煩文，巧說若此也。五品者，一、直起隨喜心，二、加自受持讀誦，三、加勸他受持讀誦，四、加兼行六度，五、加正行六度。此五人者，通論皆自行化他，下文云「五十人展轉相教」也，既皆有自行通稱弟子，皆有化他通稱法師也。別論二人但自行，三人具化他，作法師往名，在三不在五，自行既通所以皆稱弟子也。初品標人而已，格量在後說。「何況」下，第二品，況出能受持讀誦者是也，標人可解。從「斯人頂戴」下，是格量也。初心畏緣所紛動妨修正業，直專持此經，即上供養，廢事存理所益弘多；後心理觀若熟，涉外不妨內，事資於道如油多火猛、若順流而揚帆，又加功力其勢轉疾也。指經文，是法身舍利不須安生身舍利，文詮所詮能詮是塔不須事塔，經文能容第一義僧，不俟相從僧也。**

**The four grades are coarsely measured; the first grade is broadly measured. Once it is broadly measured, those superior to it can be inferred--the Buddha does not belabor the text; his skillful preaching is thus. The five grades are: (1) directly arousing the mind of rejoicing, (2) adding personal reception, upholding, reading, and reciting, (3) adding encouraging others to receive, uphold, read, and recite, (4) adding concurrent practice of the six perfections, (5) adding correct practice of the six perfections. These five persons, broadly speaking, all practice themselves and transform others; the text below says, “fifty persons teach one another in succession.” Since they all have self-practice, they are generally called disciples; since they all transform others, they are generally called Dharma teachers as well. In a narrower sense, two persons only practice themselves, three persons include transforming others; the name “Dharma teacher” applies to the three and not the five. Since self-practice is common, they are all called disciples. The first grade merely indicates the person; the measurement is stated later. From “How much more” downward, the second grade is the one able to receive, uphold, read, and recite; the person is identified and can be understood. From “This person will lift it on his head” downward is the measurement. At the beginning, fearing that conditions and entanglements will disturb and obstruct correct practice, one directly and exclusively upholds this sutra--this is the above offering. Abandoning affairs and preserving principle yields broad benefit. Later, when inner mind-contemplation is mature, engaging with externals does not obstruct the inner; affairs aid the Way like more oil makes the fire fiercer, or like raising sails with the current. Adding further effort, the momentum turns even swifter. Indicating the sutra text: it is the Dharma-body relics and does not need to enshrine physical-body relics. The text, the interpretive and the interpreted, the able-to-interpret and that which is interpreted, is the stupa and does not need an external stupa. The sutra text can contain the saṅgha of the first principle and does not await the assembled saṅgha.**

**問：**

**Question:**

---

**若爾持經即是第一義戒，何故復言能持戒者？**

**If so, upholding the sutra is the precept of the First Principle; why then speak again of one who can uphold the precepts?**

---

**答：**

**Answer:**

---

**此明初品意，不應以後品作難。若欲釋者，持經即順理戒，亦是任運持得初篇二篇，今言能持戒者，第三篇去事中無虧耳。**

**This clarifies the intent of the first grade; one should not use the later grades to object. If one wishes to explain it, upholding the sutra is to accord with the precepts of principle, and also to effortlessly uphold the first and second sections; now saying “one who can uphold the precepts” refers to no deficit in matters from the third section onward.**

---

**第三品，復能教他者是也，先標人，從「起立」下，格量也。「況復有人」下，第四品，復能兼行六度者是也。先標人，從「其德最勝」下，格量也。「若人讀誦」下，第五品，復能正行六度是也。先標人，從「若我滅後」下，格量也。結此五品，前三人是聞慧位，兼行六度思慧位，正行六度是修慧位，都是十信前耳。或云初〈隨喜品〉，是入信心位，分一品為兩心，五品即十信心，即是鐵輪六根清淨位也。**

**The third grade is one who can further teach others. It first identifies the person; from “arise and stand” downward is the measurement. From “How much more, if there is someone” downward, the fourth grade is one who can additionally practice the six perfections. It first identifies the person; from “his merit is supreme” downward is the measurement. From “If a person reads and recites” downward, the fifth grade is one who can correctly practice the six perfections. It first identifies the person; from “If after my extinction” downward is the measurement. Concluding these five grades: the first three persons are the stage of hearing-wisdom; concurrent practice of the six perfections is the stage of thinking-wisdom; correct practice of the six perfections is the stage of cultivating-wisdom--all are before the ten faiths. Some say the initial “Rejoicing” chapter is entrance into the faith-mind stage, dividing one grade into two minds; the five grades are the ten faith-minds, i.e., the iron-wheel, six-roots-purified stage.**

**偈十九行半，初五行半，頌第二品；次「若能持」下三行，頌第三品；「若有信解」下四行，頌第四品；次「恭敬」下七行，頌第五品。「生心如佛想」者，初依人號如來也。「不久詣道樹」者，其位在鐵輪，不久得入銅輪，能八相作佛也。「已趣道場」者，行處也。「三菩提」者，近處也。此第五品與第四信齊同是修慧位，若論入位同是六根清淨位也，而有現未佛世滅後之異耳(云云)。**

**The verse has nineteen and a half lines: the first five and a half lines praise the second grade; next, from “if one can uphold,” three lines praise the third grade; from “if there is faith-and-understanding,” four lines praise the fourth grade; next, from “reverently,” seven lines praise the fifth grade. “Giving rise to the thought of the Buddha” refers to first relying on the person and calling him the Tathāgata. “Before long he will reach the bodhi tree” means his stage is the iron wheel; before long he can enter the copper wheel, able to enact the eight phases of Buddhahood. “Already approaching the seat of enlightenment” is the place of practice. “Supreme Bodhi” is the near place. This fifth grade and the fourth faith are both the stage of cultivating-wisdom; if speaking of entry into the stage, both are the six-roots-purified stage, with the difference being whether in the present Buddha’s time or after extinction (and so forth).**

**「隨」者隨順事理無二無別，「喜」是慶己慶人，聞深奧法順理有實功德，順事有權功德；慶己有智慧，慶人有慈悲，權實智斷合而說之，故言「隨喜功德品」。又順理者，聞佛本地深遠深遠信順不逆，無一毫之疑滯；順事者，聞佛三世益物橫豎該亘遍一切處，亦無一毫疑滯，即廣事而達深理，即深理而達廣事，不二而二、不別而別，雖二雖別、無二無別，如此信解名之為隨。如來出世四十餘年不顯真實，七方便人不語誠諦，慶我及人，以凡夫心等佛所知，用所生眼同如來見，如此知見究竟法界廣無涯底，無等無等等更無過上，佛今說此我得聞此，故名「隨喜功德品」。第五十人是初品之初，初但有一念理解，但有一念慶己慶他，未有事行恩不及人，所獲功德如來巧喻功蓋無學，況復最初於會聞者，況復二三四五品者，況復入位十住十行乃至後心者，誰聞如是深妙功德而不景慕？如來說此令物尚之，故言「隨喜功德品」。上來稱美持經功德，時眾咸謂入真因位乃致斯德，於初心之初起輕弱想，忽聞好堅處地、芽已百圍，頻伽在㲉聲勝眾鳥，希有奇特輕疑釋然，故名「隨喜功德品」。外道得五通者，能移山竭海而不伏見愛，不及煖法人；二乘無學子果俱脫，猶被涅槃縛，不知其因果俱權；通教人修因雖巧，發心不識五百由旬，得果止除四住；別人雖勝二乘，修因則偏、其門又拙，非佛所讚，皆不及初隨喜人。佛今舉阿以況後茶都勝諸教，故言「隨喜功德品」。**

**“Rejoicing” means to accord with principle and phenomena, with no duality and no difference; “joy” means rejoicing for oneself and for others. Hearing the profound Dharma, in accord with principle one has real merits, in accord with phenomena one has provisional merits; rejoicing for oneself has wisdom, rejoicing for others has compassion. Provisional and real, wisdom and severing are spoken together, therefore it is called the “Merit of Rejoicing” chapter. Moreover, to accord with principle is: upon hearing the Buddha’s origin-ground as deep and far, one faithfully accords without opposition, with not the slightest doubt or blockage. To accord with phenomena is: upon hearing the Buddha’s benefiting beings through the three times, spanning breadth and depth everywhere, one likewise has not the slightest doubt. One reaches the deep principle through the broad phenomena, and reaches broad phenomena through the deep principle--not two yet two, not separate yet separate; though two and though separate, not two and not separate. Such faith-and-understanding is called “rejoicing.” The Tathāgata, for more than forty years after appearing in the world, did not reveal the real; the seven expedient persons were not told the true truth. Rejoice for oneself and others: with an ordinary mind equal to what the Buddha knows, with the born eye identical to the Tathāgata’s seeing. Such knowledge and vision exhaust the Dharma-realm, vast without boundary or bottom, unequalled and more-than-unequalled with nothing beyond. The Buddha now speaks this and I get to hear it; therefore it is called the “Merit of Rejoicing” chapter. The fiftieth person is the beginning of the first grade: at first there is only one thought of understanding, only one thought of rejoicing for self and others; there is not yet outward practice and the kindness does not reach others. The merit obtained, by the Tathāgata’s skillful simile, surpasses those beyond learning; how much more the very first hearer in the assembly, how much more the second, third, fourth, and fifth grades, how much more those who enter stages of ten abidings and ten practices up to the later mind--who would hear such profound and wondrous merit and not admire it? The Tathāgata says this to cause beings to esteem it; therefore it is called the “Merit of Rejoicing” chapter. Above, it praised the merits of upholding the sutra; the assembly all believed that only by entering the true causal stage could one attain such merits, and at the very beginning of the beginner’s mind they gave rise to weak and light thoughts. Suddenly they hear: good hard ground, a sprout already a hundred spans around; the kalaviṅka still in its shell, its voice surpassing the flock of birds. Rare and marvelous, their light doubts are released--therefore it is called the “Merit of Rejoicing” chapter. Non-Buddhists who attain the five superknowledges can move mountains and drain seas yet do not subdue views and attachments; they are inferior to the stage of warmth. The two vehicles’ beyond-learning, with both seed and fruit freed, are still bound by nirvāṇa and do not know that their causes and fruits are both provisional. Practitioners of the Common teaching, though skillful in cultivating causes, when they arouse the mind do not recognize the five hundred yojanas; obtaining the fruit they only remove the four abodes. Distinct practitioners, though superior to the two vehicles, are partial in cultivating causes and their gate is clumsy; they are not praised by the Buddha--all are inferior to the first rejoicing person. The Buddha now cites the “A” to infer the later “cha,” all surpassing the other teachings; therefore it is called the “Merit of Rejoicing” chapter.**

**The text has questions and answers, each with prose and verse. In the previous chapter the four persons were already measured and the first was not spoken; Maitreya, responding to the capacities, asked it out--this meaning is as in the text. The Buddha’s answer has two parts: first, he answers the inner rejoicing person; second, he directly clarifies the external listener to the Dharma. The first has five: (1) teaching one another in succession, (2) the basis for measurement, (3) question, (4) answer, (5) the direct measurement. The Southern interpretation divides the fifty persons into three: (1) successive-superior, (2) successive-equal, (3) successive-inferior. The superior are hard to obtain, the equal are also rare, the inferior are common; measuring the inferior infers the equal and superior. The Northern interpretation says the initial wondrous enlightenment speaks for a tenth-ground person, the tenth-ground person speaks for a ninth-ground person, and so on in succession down to the ten faiths; measuring the later infers the first. Now I say this is not so. The Buddha clearly states that in the first grade, within the assembly, they hear and transmit in succession; through fifty in succession, measure the later to infer the earlier. The later is not the beginning of the ten faiths, and the first is not the end of wondrous enlightenment--why use this explanation? This explanation exhausts depth but does not meet the sutra’s intent. Now there are two: (1) horizontally, in terms of the four assemblies of the various teachings, (2) directly counting in the Perfect teaching. In the Tripiṭaka teaching there are four gates; each gate has four assemblies. Further dividing into śrāmaṇera and śrāmaṇerī makes six persons; four gates then make twenty-four persons. In terms of faith-practice and dharma-practice, that makes forty-eight persons; combining the first and last makes fifty. The Common and Distinct four gates are likewise. Directly counting in the Perfect gate: the method of counting has a small seven and a great seven; the great seven has seven sevens, forty-nine. All are teachers and disciples endowed with both self-practice and transforming others; the last person only understands for himself and has no virtue of teaching others, therefore measuring below reveals above. In the measurement, first it grants worldly joy and removes the suffering of the fruit; later it grants nirvāṇa joy and removes the suffering of birth and death. This is a brief mention of Brahma merit. Now broaden it: the merit of all the people in Jambudvīpa does not equal the merit of one person in Aparagodānīya; the merit of all in Aparagodānīya does not equal that of one person in Pūrvavideha; the merit of all in the three continents does not equal that of one person in Uttarakuru; the merit of all in the four continents does not equal one Four Heavenly King; the Four Heavenly Kings do not equal one Indra; up to the Sixth Heaven does not equal one Brahma merit. Brahma merit has concentrated and scattered: for the scattered, one builds a stupa where there is no stupa; one repairs a ruined stupa; one gathers the saṅgha and asks to turn the wheel of Dharma; if the assembly disperses one reunites them--these are the four merits. Being equal to Brahma heaven, it is called Brahma merit. Holy merit refers to arhats abiding in their final body and attaining nirvāṇa-with-remainder. There are also those of the three vehicles who realize the dharma-body, together studying the unarising and cutting off afflictions completely, like burning wood into charcoal. There is also the holy merit of bodhisattvas: practicing themselves and transforming others, all by the wordless Way, cutting off afflictions and entering nirvāṇa-without-remainder. There is also bodhisattva merit: from the first arousing of the mind, sequentially transforming people into the great nirvāṇa. In such measurement, Brahma merit does not equal holy merit; holy merit does not equal dharma-body holy merit; dharma-body holy merit does not equal lesser-bodhisattva merit; lesser-bodhisattva merit does not equal great-bodhisattva merit; great-bodhisattva merit does not equal the initial rejoicing merit of hearing the *Lotus Sutra*. Why? Because those are not Buddha-dharma, not real, and not perfect; though one abides in a later fruit, it does not equal my initial mind--this is its meaning. I privately say: to urge people to hear the Dharma, from being born in the same place with dharani bodhisattvas up to possessing all the marks of a person, there are fifty merits in total; taking merits to classify persons also makes fifty. Above, the fifty discuss inner understanding of rejoicing; here we only discuss external affairs as the difference. Moreover, this text also has merits of the six roots: keen faculties and wisdom are the merit of the mind; the tongue not being mute is the merit of the tongue; the nose being long and straight is the merit of the nose; seeing the Buddha is the merit of the eye; hearing the Dharma is the merit of the ear; the rest are the merits of the body. The former are merits of the semblance stage; these are merits before the semblance stage. As to listening to the sutra, the text has four: (1) going oneself, (2) sharing seats, (3) encouraging others, (4) fully listening and practicing (and so forth).**

**釋法師功德品**

**Explanation of the "Merits of the Dharma Teacher" Chapter**

---

**「法師」義，如上說。「功德」者，前謂初品之初功德，今五品之上，謂六根清淨，內外莊嚴五根清淨名外莊嚴；意根清淨名內莊嚴。又從地獄已上至佛[6]而還，一切色像悉身中現者，名內莊嚴；從地獄已上佛已還，一切色像以普現三昧而外化者，名外莊嚴。身根既爾，餘五根亦然。讀誦既爾，四種亦然。初品既爾，四品加然。相似既爾，分真倍然。行者聞說此功德利喜不自勝，勤求無[7]厭信進倍增，明識大乘有大勢力決無疑網，似解之初初，過二乘之極極百千萬倍，指始顯終懸解究竟第一義諦不可思議。此品所明備斯四意，故言「法師功德品」也。六根功德者，光宅云：「三業合十善，一善具十為百，自行、化他、隨喜、讚歎合四百，約五種法師為二千，三品分之即六千功德，此土三根用弱奪言八百，三根用強與言千二，與奪合論還是六千也。」有人明數與光宅同，下品八百、中品一千、上品千二百。諸師偏釋未會今經，亦不合諸教。《大品》云「色淨故般若淨，般若淨故色淨，色淨五根淨，般若淨意根淨」，若六根等，云何判上中下、強弱用耶？若一強一不強，一淨一不淨，一上品餘非上品(云云)。《正法華》整足具六千功德，不論上中下(云云)。《法華論》云「凡人以經力故得勝根用，雖未入初地，以父母所生肉眼，見大千內外也。」《大經》云「如來一根則能見色、聞聲、嗅香、別味、覺觸、知法」，今經六根清淨與《大品》同；以是功德莊嚴六根，與《正法華》同，鼻見色聞聲覺知與《涅槃》同，肉眼有天眼慧法佛眼等用與《論》同，文義如此，不可以偏見抑正經。今當說之，光宅數整足根不依文，今按三業安樂行即有十善，一善有十即百善，一善中有十如即千善，就化他為二千，約如來室、如來衣、如來座，即成六千，五種法師悉具六根清淨，一一根皆有一千功德也。**

**The meaning of “Dharma teacher” is as explained above. “Merits and virtues”: previously it referred to the initial merits of the first grade; now it is above the five grades, meaning the purification of the six roots and inner and outer adornment. The purification of the five roots is called outer adornment; the purification of the mind root is called inner adornment. Moreover, from hell up to the Buddha and back, if all forms and images are entirely manifested within the body, it is called inner adornment; from hell up to the Buddha and back, if all forms and images are externally transformed by the samadhi of universal manifestation, it is called outer adornment. If it is so for the body root, it is likewise for the other five roots. If it is so for reading and reciting, it is likewise for the four [modes]. If it is so for the first grade, it is all the more so for the four grades. If it is so for the semblance stage, it is doubly so for partial realization. When practitioners hear these merits and benefits, their joy surpasses itself; they diligently seek without weariness and their faith and vigor double, clearly knowing the Great Vehicle has great power and certainly no net of doubt. The very first of semblance understanding surpasses the utmost of the two vehicles by hundreds of thousands of myriads. Pointing to the beginning reveals the end; suspended understanding of the ultimate First Principle is inconceivable. This chapter clarifies all four meanings; therefore it is called the “Merits of the Dharma Teacher” chapter. As for the merits of the six roots, Guangzhai says: “The three karmas combined with the ten good [deeds]; one good includes ten to make a hundred. Self-practice, transforming others, rejoicing, and praising together make four hundred. By the five kinds of Dharma teachers it becomes two thousand. Dividing by the three grades yields six thousand merits. In this land, the use of three roots is weak and reduced to eight hundred; the use of three roots is strong and increased to twelve hundred; combining reduction and increase still comes to six thousand.” Someone explains the numbers the same as Guangzhai: lower grade eight hundred, middle grade one thousand, upper grade twelve hundred. The various masters explain partially and do not meet this sutra, nor accord with the other teachings. The *Great Prajna* says, “Because form is pure, prajna is pure; because prajna is pure, form is pure; because form is pure the five roots are pure; because prajna is pure the mind root is pure.” If the six roots are equal, how can one judge upper, middle, and lower, or strong and weak usages? If one is strong and another not strong, one pure and another not pure, one upper-grade and the rest not upper-grade (and so forth). The *Correct Dharma Lotus* fully has six thousand merits and does not discuss upper, middle, or lower (and so forth). The *Treatise on the Lotus Sutra* says, “Because of the power of the sutra, ordinary people gain superior root-function; though they have not entered the first ground, with the fleshly eyes born of father and mother they can see inside and outside a great thousand.” The *Great Sutra* says, “With a single root, the Tathāgata can see forms, hear sounds, smell fragrances, distinguish tastes, feel touches, and know dharmas.” In this sutra, the purification of the six roots accords with the *Great Prajna*; adorning the six roots with these merits accords with the *Correct Dharma Lotus*; the nose seeing forms, hearing sounds, and knowing through contact accords with the *Nirvāṇa*; the fleshly eye having the functions of the heavenly eye, wisdom eye, dharma eye, and Buddha eye accords with the *Treatise*. The text and meaning are thus; one must not suppress the correct sutra with a partial view. Now I will speak: Guangzhai’s numbers for the fully complete roots do not follow the text. According to the three karmas, peaceful-practice conduct already has the ten goods; one good has ten, thus a hundred goods; one good has ten suchnesses, thus a thousand goods. Taking transforming others makes two thousand; in terms of the Tathāgata’s room, robe, and seat, it becomes six thousand. The five kinds of Dharma teachers all possess six-root purification, and each root has one thousand merits.**

**復次一心中具十法界，一一界皆有十如，即成一百，一根通取六塵，即有六百，約定慧二莊嚴，即是一千二百，根根悉用定慧莊嚴等千二百也。若論六根清淨，清淨則不言功德若少若多，若言莊嚴能盈能縮能等等莊嚴者，根根六千，若言千二顯其能盈，若言八百顯其能縮，若言清淨無盈無縮無等，六根互用根自在故、不可思議故。若偏判者則失旨也。相似之位，若依四輪即鐵輪位也；若依五十二位，即十信心也；若依《仁王》即十善大心也。今對常精進者，即十信之第三心也。諸經名目雖異，同是圓教相似位耳。**

**Furthermore, one mind contains the ten dharma realms; each realm has ten suchnesses, making one hundred. One root universally takes the six sense objects, making six hundred. In terms of the two adornments of samadhi and wisdom, this is twelve hundred; each root is adorned with samadhi and wisdom and is thus twelve hundred. If we speak of six roots being pure, purity does not speak of merits as few or many. If we speak of adornment that can expand or contract or equalize, then each root has six thousand. If we say twelve hundred, that displays its ability to expand; if we say eight hundred, that displays its ability to contract; if we say purity, there is no expansion, no contraction, no equality. The six roots mutually function; the roots are self-mastered because of inconceivability. If one judges partiality, one loses the intent. The semblance stage: if according to the four wheels, it is the iron-wheel stage; if according to the fifty-two stages, it is the ten-faith mind; if according to the *Renwang*, it is the ten-good great mind. Now, in relation to constant vigor, it is the third mind of the ten faiths. Although the names in various sutras differ, they are all the Perfect teaching’s semblance stage.**

**文為二：初、總列六根盈縮功德數，次、別作六章解釋。各有長行、偈頌。眼根章明父母所生名肉眼，而所見過於天眼。梵王報得天眼，在己界遍見大千，大千外有風輪與眼作障不能見外，若在他界則不遍見大千，非所統故。小羅漢見小千，大羅漢見大千，辟支佛見百佛世界，不以風輪為礙，亦無己他界隔。今經論眼，能見大千內外應是天眼，那名肉眼？此是圓教似位。因經之力有勝根用，既未發真不得稱天眼，猶名肉眼，例如小乘方便未得神通則不稱天眼耳。猶是分段之身，故稱父母所生。雖稱肉眼，具五眼用：見大千內外，天眼用；見一切眾生及業因緣，法眼用；其目甚清淨，慧眼用；一時悉見大千內外見業見淨，又圓伏法界上惑，佛眼用。《大經》云「雖有肉眼名為佛眼」，佛眼故名清淨，具五眼故故言莊嚴，能盈能縮名勝根用，名根自在，豈可[1]祇作八百千二百解耶？耳根章遍聞大千內外十法界音聲，聞六道即肉天二耳，聞二乘即慧耳，聞菩薩即法耳，聞佛即佛耳。又父母所生肉耳，能聞內外即天耳，聽之不著即慧耳，不謬即法耳，一時互聞即佛耳。以耳例眼眼亦如是，見人天是二眼，見二乘是慧眼，見菩薩是法眼，見佛即佛眼(云云)。鼻根章亦如是，父母所生即肉鼻，大千內外即天鼻，不染不著即慧鼻，分別不謬即法鼻，一時互用即佛鼻。此章明互用者，鼻知好惡別貴賤，覩天宮莊嚴等，則鼻有眼用；讀經說法聞香能知，鼻有耳用；諸樹花果實及蘇油香氣，鼻有舌用；入禪出禪禪有八觸故，五欲嬉戲亦是觸法，鼻有身用；染欲癡恚心亦知修善者，鼻有意用。鼻根自在勝用若茲，例五根亦如是。舌根章亦如是，父母所生即[2]是肉舌，能作十法界語，約此即是五舌義明矣，能作十法界語即天舌，不壞即慧舌，不謬即法舌，一時互用即佛舌(云云)。問：苦澁惡味至舌皆變成上味，眾色到眼何不變成妙色？舊不例，味有損益，損者變，不損者不變，諸色不壞眼故不例。今解不爾，一切色同佛色，一切聲同佛聲，等皆清淨例則無妨。遍知一切色法聲法無亂無謬，分別亦無妨，自在之根那作頑礙之解耶？身根章亦如是，世間所有，皆於身中現肉身用也，上至有頂於身中現天身用也，二乘身中現慧身用也，菩薩於身中現法身用也，佛於身中現佛身用也，一時圓現一時互用，一時無謬一時無著(云云)。意根章亦如是，世間資生產業，皆順正法人意淨天心所行天所動作悉知天意淨。四月即四諦，一歲即十二月，是十二因緣，與實相不相違背，即慧意淨。一月即一乘菩薩意淨，有所思量皆是先佛經中所說即佛意淨。一時圓明一時圓互，一時無染一時無謬，根用自在能盈能縮能等[3]能淨(云云)。**

**The text has two parts: first, it generally lists the numbers of the merits of the six roots in expansion and contraction; second, it separately explains them in six chapters. Each has prose and verse. The eye-root chapter clarifies that the eyes born of father and mother are called the fleshly eyes, yet what they see surpasses the heavenly eye. The Brahma king’s reward-granted heavenly eye can see throughout a great thousand within his own realm; outside the great thousand there is a wind-wheel that blocks the eyes, so they cannot see beyond. If he is in another realm, he cannot see throughout the great thousand, because it is not under his domain. Lesser arhats see a small thousand; great arhats see a great thousand; pratyekabuddhas see a hundred Buddha-worlds, not impeded by the wind-wheel and not separated by one’s own or another’s realm. In this sutra, discussing the eyes, they can see inside and outside a great thousand--should that not be the heavenly eye? Why call it fleshly eyes? This is the semblance stage of the Perfect teaching. By the power of the sutra they have superior root-function; since true realization has not yet arisen, they cannot be called heavenly eyes and are still called fleshly eyes--just like the Small Vehicle’s expedients: if one has not yet gained spiritual powers, one is not called to have heavenly eyes. It is still a body of segmented existence, therefore it is called born of father and mother. Though called fleshly eyes, they have the function of the five eyes: seeing inside and outside a great thousand is the function of the heavenly eye; seeing all beings and their karmic causes and conditions is the function of the dharma eye; the eyes themselves are very pure, the function of the wisdom eye; seeing all inside and outside at once, seeing karma and seeing purity, and also perfectly subduing the higher delusions of the dharma-realm is the function of the Buddha eye. The *Great Sutra* says, “Though there is a fleshly eye, it is called the Buddha eye.” Because it is the Buddha eye, it is called pure; because it has the five eyes, it is called adornment. The ability to expand and contract is called superior root-function, called root-mastery. How could one[1] merely interpret it as eight hundred or twelve hundred? The ear-root chapter universally hears the sounds of the ten dharma realms within and beyond a great thousand. Hearing the six paths is the two ears of flesh and heaven; hearing the two vehicles is the wisdom ear; hearing bodhisattvas is the dharma ear; hearing the Buddha is the Buddha ear. Again, the fleshly ear born of father and mother can hear inside and outside--this is the heavenly ear; hearing without attachment is the wisdom ear; without error is the dharma ear; hearing mutually at one time is the Buddha ear. Taking the ear as an example, the eye is likewise: seeing humans and gods is the two eyes, seeing the two vehicles is the wisdom eye, seeing bodhisattvas is the dharma eye, seeing the Buddha is the Buddha eye (and so forth). The nose-root chapter is likewise: the nose born of father and mother is the fleshly nose; inside and outside a great thousand is the heavenly nose; not tainted and not attached is the wisdom nose; discerning without error is the dharma nose; mutual functioning at one time is the Buddha nose. This chapter clarifies mutual functioning: the nose knows good and bad and distinguishes noble and base; seeing the adornments of heavenly palaces and the like means the nose has the function of the eye. Reading sutras and explaining the Dharma, hearing fragrances and knowing them means the nose has the function of the ear. The flowers and fruits of trees and the fragrances of ghee and oils means the nose has the function of the tongue. Entering and leaving dhyana, dhyana has eight touches; play in the five desires is also a dharma of touch, so the nose has the function of the body. The mind’s stained desire, delusion, and anger also know who cultivates the good, so the nose has the function of the mind. The nose-root’s mastery and superior function are thus; by analogy the five roots are likewise. The tongue-root chapter is likewise: the tongue born of father and mother is[2] the fleshly tongue. It can produce the speech of the ten dharma realms--with this, the meaning of the five tongues is clear. Being able to produce the speech of the ten dharma realms is the heavenly tongue; not being destroyed is the wisdom tongue; not erring is the dharma tongue; mutual functioning at one time is the Buddha tongue (and so forth). Question: bitter, astringent, and evil flavors all become supreme flavors upon reaching the tongue; why do the many forms not become wondrous forms when they reach the eye? The old explanation does not take it as analogous: flavors have harm and benefit; the harmful transforms, the non-harmful does not; forms do not harm the eye, therefore it is not analogous. The present explanation is not so: all forms are identical to the Buddha’s forms; all sounds are identical to the Buddha’s sounds; since all are pure, the analogy is unobstructed. Universally knowing all forms and all sounds without confusion or error, and without obstructing discrimination as well--how could one interpret the root of mastery as dull and obstructed? The body-root chapter is likewise: all in the world are manifested within the body as the function of the flesh body; up to the Peak of Existence, within the body is manifested the function of the heavenly body; within the two vehicles’ bodies is manifested the function of the wisdom body; within bodhisattvas’ bodies is manifested the function of the dharma body; within the Buddha’s body is manifested the function of the Buddha body--all are perfectly manifested at one time, mutually functioning at one time, without error at one time, without attachment at one time (and so forth). The mind-root chapter is likewise: worldly means of livelihood and production all accord with the right Dharma, and thus the human mind is pure; all actions of the heavenly mind are known, and thus the heavenly mind is pure. Four months are the Four Truths; one year is twelve months, i.e., the twelve links of dependent origination; they do not contradict suchness, and thus the wisdom mind is pure. One month is the mind-purity of the One Vehicle bodhisattva; all thoughts are what the former Buddhas said in the sutras, and thus the Buddha mind is pure. At one time it is perfectly bright, at one time it perfectly interpenetrates; at one time without defilement, at one time without error; the root-functions are self-mastery, able to expand, able to contract, able to equalize, able to purify[3] (and so forth).**

**釋常不輕菩薩品**

**Explanation of the "Never Disparaging Bodhisattva" Chapter**

---

**內懷不輕之解，外敬不輕之境，身立不輕之行，口宣不輕之教，人作不輕之目。不輕之解者，《法華論》云「此菩薩知眾生有佛性不敢輕之。佛性有五，正因佛性，通亘本當；緣了佛性，種子本有非適今也。果性果果性定當得之，決不虛也，是名不輕之解。」將解以歷人，彼亦如此，是名敬不輕之境；敬此境故名不輕之行；宣此語故名不輕之教。昔毀者以此目人，今經家以此目品。《見實三昧》云「佛為父王說一切皆是佛，王問：『一切眾生即是佛不？』佛答：『若如實見眾生，於其即是佛。』」私類此語，若不如實見佛，於其則非聖。譬初學射的多乖少當，以地為的無往不著。若分別賢聖孰是孰非，如實觀之即是佛也。初是因緣解，後是圓教解(云云)。此品引人為證，證五品功德深、六根報重，我昔隨喜獲現生後報，以募流通也。**

**Internally he holds the understanding of not-disparaging; externally he reveres the realm of not-disparaging. His body establishes the practice of not-disparaging; his mouth proclaims the teaching of not-disparaging; people make the name “Never Disparaging.” As for the understanding of not-disparaging, the *Treatise on the Lotus Sutra* says: “This bodhisattva knows that beings have Buddha-nature and does not dare to disparage them. Buddha-nature has five: the primary-cause Buddha-nature, universally inherent as originally to-be; the conditions-and-understanding Buddha-nature, the seed originally present, not newly acquired; the fruit-nature and fruit-of-fruit nature are certainly to be attained and are never false--this is called the understanding of not-disparaging.” Applying this understanding to persons, they are also thus; this is called revering the realm of not-disparaging. Revering this realm is therefore called the practice of not-disparaging; proclaiming this speech is therefore called the teaching of not-disparaging. Formerly the slanderers used this to name him; now the sutra-compilers use it to name the chapter. The *Samadhi of Seeing Reality* says, “The Buddha told his royal father that all are Buddhas. The king asked: ‘Are all beings then Buddhas?’ The Buddha replied: ‘If one truly sees beings, then with respect to them they are Buddhas.’” I privately analogize these words: if one does not truly see the Buddha, then with respect to him one is not a sage. It is like a beginner shooting at a target--many miss, few hit; taking the ground as the target, one hits without fail. If one discriminates sages and saints as who is or is not, then truly observing it, it is the Buddha. The first is an explanation by causes and conditions; the latter is a Perfect-teaching explanation (and so forth). This chapter cites a person as evidence, attesting that the five grades’ merits are deep and the retribution of the six roots is weighty. I formerly rejoiced and obtained present-life and later retribution, thereby recruiting circulation.**

**The text has prose and verse. The prose has three parts: (1) it doubly indicates the sins and blessings of the previous chapter; (2) it doubly opens the faith and slander of this chapter; (3) it doubly exhorts the latter two, adverse and favorable[4]. The double indication: first it points to the sins, as stated in the “Dharma Teacher” chapter; next it points to the blessings, as stated in the “Merits” chapter, as in the text. The second, doubly opening faith and slander, has the present basis and the past event. The present basis has the time period, names, kalpa, land, and preaching, all as in the text. Second, from “the very first King Awesome Sound” down it clarifies the past event, in three: first, clarifying the time period; second, from “in the Dharma-Image age,” it doubly marks two persons’ names--the slanderer, due to the time, is called Increased Pride; the believer, due to the time, is called Never Disparaging. Third, from “gaining great power,” it doubly clarifies gains and losses. Gains and losses are again two: first, in terms of the believer, it discusses the gains--gaining the vast purport of the correct preaching, gaining the wondrous benefit of circulation. The name “Never Disparaging” is the one of person; whatever is seen is the one of principle; all prostrations are the one of practice; and making this statement[1] is the one of teaching. These are the four ones of opening the provisional and revealing the real. From “up to seeing from afar” down is the original one of principle; therefore going to prostrate is the original one of practice, and making this statement is the original one of teaching. If one reduces the one of person, the meaning is explainable. These are the four ones of opening the near and revealing the far. The text says, “not specializing in reading and reciting scriptures but only practicing prostration”--this is the stage of the first rejoicing person. Rejoicing in all dharmas as all possessing the nature of peace and bliss, all being the one real suchness; rejoicing that all people have the three Buddha-natures; reading and reciting scriptures is the nature of understanding as cause; all practice of the bodhisattva path is the nature of conditions as cause; not daring to disparage and instead deeply revering is the primary-cause nature. Revering[2] people and revering the Dharma without giving rise to contention is precisely the meaning of rejoicing. Not-disparaging and deep reverence is the Tathāgata’s seat; enduring blows and insults is wearing the Tathāgata’s robe; constantly practicing with a compassionate mind without ceasing is the Tathāgata’s room. Moreover, deep reverence is the karma of mind, the teaching of not-disparaging is the karma of speech, and thus going to prostrate is the karma of body. These three together with compassion are the vow-based peaceful practices. With these three and four, how could they not be the wondrous benefit of circulation--what else could it be?**

**從「四眾之中」下，第二，明毀者之失。「生瞋恚心不淨者」，不受四一也。「罵言無智」，智知於理，既言無智，不受理一也；「比丘」即不受人一也；「從何所來」，不受行一也，「虛妄授記」，不受教一也。「經歷多年常被罵」者，結不受開權顯實之四一也。「避走遠住高聲唱言」亦復不受，此不受開近顯遠本地之四一也。「常作是語故」，結信者深信不休也。「四眾為作不輕名」者，此結毀者呰毀不止也。**

**From “within the four assemblies” down, second, it clarifies the loss of those who slander. “Giving rise to an impure mind of anger” means not accepting the four ones. “Cursing, saying ‘without wisdom’”: wisdom knows principle; once one says “without wisdom,” one does not accept the one of principle. “Bhikshu” means not accepting the one of person. “Where do you come from” means not accepting the one of practice. “False prediction” means not accepting the one of teaching. “Through many years, constantly cursed” concludes not accepting the four ones of opening the provisional and revealing the real. “Fleeing far away and dwelling there, loudly proclaiming” likewise does not accept; this is not accepting the four ones of opening the near and revealing the far, the original ground. “Because he constantly made such speech” concludes that the believer’s deep faith does not rest. “The four assemblies made the name ‘Never Disparaging’” concludes that the slanderers’ reviling does not cease.**

**問：**

**Question:**

---

**釋迦出世踟蹰不說，常不輕一見，造次而言，何也？**

**Śākyamuni appeared in the world and hesitated to speak; Never Disparaging saw once and spoke on the spot--why?**

---

**答：**

**Answer:**

---

**本已有善，釋迦以小而將護之；本未有善，不輕以大而強毒之(云云)。**

**If there was already good, Śākyamuni used the small to protect it; if there was not yet good, Never Disparaging used the great to strongly poison it (and so forth).**

**從「臨欲終時」下，雙明信、毀果報。初文為二：一、明果報，二、結會古今。信者論三報，現得六根清淨，生值燈明佛，後值二千億佛。「神通力」是身業淨，「樂說辯力」是口業淨，「善寂力」是意業淨(云云)。結會又二：初、結會，如文；從「若我宿世」下，第二，是舉信者而勸順也，如文。從「彼時四眾」下，明毀者果報，又二：先明得果，後結古今。毀者得善惡兩果，謗故墮惡，聞佛性名毒鼓之力獲善果報。結古今又二：初、結古今，次從「當知」下，舉逆以顯順，勸持以遮毀。經有大力終感大果，務當勤習五種之行。**

**From “when he was about to die” down, it doubly clarifies the retributions of faith and slander. The first passage has two parts: (1) clarifying retribution, (2) concluding the connection of past and present. For the believer, it discusses three retributions: in the present he attains purification of the six roots; in birth he meets the Buddha Lamp Bright; afterward he meets two thousand kotis of Buddhas. “Power of spiritual penetrations” is purity of bodily karma; “power of joyful eloquence” is purity of verbal karma; “power of good quiescence” is purity of mental karma (and so forth). The conclusion also has two parts: first, concluding the connection, as in the text; second, from “if in my past lives,” it raises the believer to exhort accord, as in the text. From “at that time the four assemblies” down, it clarifies the retribution of the slanderers, again in two: first it clarifies the obtained fruits, then it concludes past and present. The slanderers obtain both good and evil fruits: because of slander they fall into evil; by hearing the name of Buddha-nature, the power of the poison-drum yields good retribution. The conclusion of past and present again has two: first, concluding past and present; next, from “you should know,” it raises the adverse to reveal the favorable, exhorting upholding to block slander. The sutra has great power and in the end elicits great fruits; one must diligently practice the five kinds of conduct.**

**偈有十九行半，初十五行半，但頌信毀因果；後四行，頌勸持，在文可見，不細出也。「著法」者，是法不可示，若定謂是有，即是著法，乃至定謂是非有非無，亦名著法者。《佛藏》云「刀輪害閻浮人其失猶少，有所得心說大乘者，其罪過彼也(云云)。」《大論》云「執有與無諍，乃至執非有非無與有無諍，如牛皮龍繩俱不[3]免患。」《中論》云「諸佛說空法，本為化於有，若有著空者，諸佛所不化。」若定言諸法非有非無者，是名愚癡論，若失四悉檀意。自行化他皆名著法，若得四悉檀意，自他俱無著也。[4]**

**The verse has nineteen and a half lines: the first fifteen and a half lines only praise the causes and fruits of faith and slander; the last four lines praise exhorting to uphold--this can be seen in the text and need not be detailed. “Attachment to dharmas” means this Dharma cannot be indicated; if one definitively asserts it is existent, that is attachment to dharmas. Even to definitively assert it is neither existent nor non-existent is also called attachment to dharmas. The *Buddha Treasury* says, “The harm of the wheel of blades killing people in Jambudvīpa is still a lesser loss; one who speaks the Great Vehicle with a mind of acquisition has a transgression far beyond that (and so forth).” The *Great Treatise* says, “Clinging to existence and nonexistence and contending, even clinging to neither existence nor nonexistence and contending with existence and nonexistence, is like oxhide and dragon rope--both do not[3] escape calamity.” The *Madhyamaka* says, “The Buddhas speak the Dharma of emptiness originally to transform those attached to existence; if there are those attached to emptiness, the Buddhas do not transform them.” If one definitively says all dharmas are neither existent nor non-existent, this is called a foolish theory, as it loses the intent of the Four Siddhantas. Self-practice and transforming others are both called attachment to dharmas; if one attains the intent of the Four Siddhantas, self and other are both unattached.[4]**

*[Critical apparatus: [5] 不分卷【甲】]*

**如來者，上釋[6]竟。「神」名不測，「力」名幹用，不測則天然之體深，幹用則轉變之力大，此中為付囑深法，現十種大力，故名「神力品」。自此品下凡有八品，是付囑、流通。今品明菩薩受命弘經，次品如來摩頂付累。**

**As for the Tathāgata, the above has already explained it and completed[6]. “Spirit” means unfathomable; “power” means functional efficacy. The unfathomable means the innate substance is deep; functional efficacy means the power of transformation is great. Here, in order to entrust the deep Dharma, he manifests ten kinds of great power, therefore it is called the “Spiritual Powers” chapter. From this chapter down there are eight chapters--entrustment and circulation. This chapter clarifies bodhisattvas receiving the commission to propagate the sutra; the next chapter has the Tathāgata touching their crowns to entrust.**

**文有長行、偈頌。長行為三：一、菩薩受命，二、佛現神力，三、結要勸持。初、經家敘敬儀，次、發誓弘經。弘經為三：一、時節，佛滅後是也；二、處所，分身等國是也；三、誓願，非但奉命益他，亦自願此真淨大法，兼濟俱美也。**

**The text has prose and verse. The prose has three parts: (1) the bodhisattvas receive the commission; (2) the Buddha manifests spiritual powers; (3) he summarizes the essentials and exhorts upholding. First, the sutra-compilers narrate the ritual of reverence; next, they vow to propagate the sutra. Propagating the sutra has three: (1) the time period--after the Buddha’s extinction; (2) the place--the lands of the emanation bodies and the like; (3) the vows--not only to carry out the command and benefit others, but also to personally vow this true and pure great Dharma; to rescue and to be beautiful together.**

**From “at that time” downward is the second: manifesting the ten spiritual powers, in two parts. First, the assembly addressed[7]; second, the direct manifestation of the spiritual powers. “Mañjuśrī and the like” are the trace-transformed assembly. “Previously dwelling” are the original transformed assembly from below. “All” refers to those who came from other directions and those who came from the emanation Buddhas.**

**The ten spiritual powers are: (1) the tongue-protruding sign. The present sutra expounds opening the three and revealing the one, the inner concealed and the outer manifest, abandoning the near and revealing the far--it clarifies that the benefits for beings through the three times are all true and not false. The tongues of those with merit reach to the nose; those of the Tripiṭaka Buddhas reach to the hairline. Now it reaches the Brahma heaven, surpassing ordinary and sage and extending to the summit of the pure heaven. Since the sign is beyond the usual, the preaching is all the more credible. (2) From every hair pore of the whole body light is emitted everywhere, universally illuminating the ten directions with no place unbright, signifying that the wisdom-realm is exhausted. Above, the white ūrṇā emitted radiance starting in the east, signifying that the seven expedients first see one principle. Now that the Fundamental Gate is complete, it emits all lights to illuminate all lands, able to lead initial causes to finally reach Equal Enlightenment and ultimate Buddha-wisdom; the emanation Buddhas are likewise. (3) Clearing the throat is the gesture before speaking and also a sign of unblocking and free flow. For more than forty years the true was concealed; now it is stretched out and released without remaining obstruction. This is the great matter of my appearance in the world being free-flowing. Therefore he clears his throat, wishing to entrust this Dharma to the bodhisattvas so that in later ages they guide and benefit beings. Because he is about to speak of this matter, he clears his throat. Clearing the throat has two meanings: one[1] clearing means the matter is settled; one[2] clearing means entrusting it to others. (4) Snapping the fingers is rejoicing. Rejoicing that the seven expedients together enter the Perfect[3] path;[4] rejoicing that the Perfect path increases wisdom and reduces births; rejoicing that the bodhisattvas uphold the true and pure great Dharma; rejoicing that later ages will obtain the unsurpassed treasure. This single snap pierces the three times vertically and spans the ten directions horizontally. (5) The sixfold quake of the earth signifies the six turns by which ignorance is moved from the initial mind to the final mind; now it clarifies again that it moves the six roots of all people so they attain purity. (6) Universally seeing the great assembly signifies that the Buddhas’ paths are the same, and from now on it will be likewise. The five thousand who rose and left were moved through three transformations; having already lost their original mind, they could not manifest benefit. It is fitting to manifest extinction though not extinct; by the bodhisattvas’ propagation of the sutra they attain the path and enter the Buddha-wisdom, no different from this assembly now; it also signifies that in the future there will be a unified capacity. (7) A voice in the sky proclaims, signifying that in the future there will be a unified teaching. (8) “Namo, taking refuge as Buddha’s disciples” signifies that in the future there will be a unified person. (9) Scattering objects from afar that gather like clouds and arrive signifies that in the future there will be a unified practice. (10) The ten directions being fully the same as one Buddha-land signifies the unity of principle.**

**從「爾時佛告上行」下，是第三，結要付囑。文為四：一、稱歎付囑；二、結要付囑；三、勸獎付囑；四、釋付囑。初歎如文。結要有四句：一切法者，一切皆佛法也，此結一切皆妙名也；一切力者，通達無礙具八自在，此結妙用也；一切秘藏者，遍一切處皆是實相，此結妙體也；一切深事者，因果是深事，此結妙宗也。「皆於此經宣示顯說」者，總結一經唯四而已，撮其樞柄而授與之。從「是故汝等」下，三，是獎勸付囑，如文。從「所以者何」下，四，是釋付囑也。上云「經卷所在之處皆應起塔」，經中要說要在四事：「道場」釋上甚深之事，「得菩提」釋上祕藏，「轉法輪」釋上一切法，「入涅槃」釋上神力，此之四要攝經文盡，故皆應起塔也。所言要者，得菩提是法身，轉法輪是般若，入涅槃是解脫，三法成祕密藏，佛住其中，即是塔義也。《阿含》云「佛出世唯四處起塔，生處、得道[6]處、轉法輪、入涅槃。」坐道場是法身生處，餘悉如文。**

**From “at that time the Buddha told Superior Practice” down is the third: summarizing the essentials and entrusting. The text has four parts: (1) praise and entrust; (2) summarize the essentials and entrust; (3) exhort and encourage entrustment; (4) explain the entrustment. The first praises as in the text. The summary of essentials has four phrases: “all dharmas” means all are Buddha-dharma--this concludes that all are wondrous in name; “all powers” means penetrating without obstruction, possessing the eight freedoms--this concludes wondrous function; “all secret treasuries” means everywhere is real suchness--this concludes wondrous substance; “all deep matters” means causes and fruits are deep matters--this concludes wondrous principle. “All are proclaimed and revealed in this sutra” summarizes that the entire sutra is only these four, gathering its pivot and handing it over to them. From “therefore you” down, third, is exhorting and encouraging entrustment, as in the text. From “why is this” down, fourth, is explaining the entrustment. Above it says, “Wherever the sutra scroll is located, one should raise a stupa.” The essential points of the sutra are in four matters: “the bodhi seat” explains the above deep matters; “attaining bodhi” explains the above secret treasury; “turning the Dharma wheel” explains the above all dharmas; “entering nirvāṇa” explains the above spiritual powers. These four essentials encompass the sutra text entirely; therefore one should raise a stupa everywhere. The essentials are: attaining bodhi is the Dharma-body; turning the Dharma wheel is prajna; entering nirvāṇa is liberation. The three dharmas form the secret treasury; the Buddha dwells within them--this is the meaning of a stupa. The *Agamas* say, “When the Buddha appears in the world, only four places should raise a stupa: the place of birth, the place of attaining the path[6], turning the Dharma wheel, and entering nirvāṇa.” Sitting at the bodhi seat is the birthplace of the Dharma-body; the rest are as in the text.**

**The verse has sixteen lines: the first four lines praise the ten spiritual powers; the next twelve lines praise the summary of essentials. From “entrustment” down, two lines, and from “the merit of this person,” generally praise the four dharmas. From “one who can uphold is to have already seen me” down, second, eight and a half lines separately praise the four dharmas. The first one and a half verses praise all dharmas--upholding the Dharma is upholding the Buddha-body (and so forth). The two verses “let me and my emanations” praise spiritual powers; spiritual powers exhort the Buddha and make him[7] rejoice. The one verse “the Buddhas sit at the bodhi seat” praises the secret essentials and can be understood. The four verses “the meanings of dharmas” praise the deep matters. Preaching the Dharma to break darkness and enter the One Vehicle is the Buddha’s deep matter[8]. The last one and a half verses generally praise the concluding summary.**

**釋囑累品**

**Explanation of the "Entrustment" Chapter**

---

**「囑」是佛所付囑，「累」是煩爾宣傳，此從聖旨得名，故言「囑累」。「囑」是頂受所囑，「累」是甘而弗勞，此從菩薩敬順得名，故言「囑累」。「囑」是如來金口所囑，「累」是菩薩丹心頂荷，此從授受合論，故言「囑累品」也。是故如來躬從座起，申手摩頂授以難得之法，大眾曲躬合掌，如世尊勅當具奉行殷勤授受，故名「囑累品」也。**

**“Entrust” is what the Buddha entrusts; “burden” is troubling you to proclaim it. This name comes from the holy decree, therefore it is called “Entrustment.” “Entrust” is receiving the entrustment on the crown of the head; “burden” is bearing it gladly without toil. This name comes from the bodhisattvas’ reverent compliance, therefore it is called “Entrustment.” “Entrust” is what the Tathāgata’s golden mouth entrusts; “burden” is the bodhisattvas’ crimson heart carrying it on their crown. From considering the giving and receiving together, it is called the “Entrustment” chapter. Therefore the Tathāgata personally rises from his seat, extends his hand to touch the crowns and grants the hard-to-obtain Dharma. The great assembly bends and joins palms; as the World-Honored One commands, they should fully carry it out, diligently giving and receiving. Therefore it is called the “Entrustment” chapter.**

**The text has two parts: first, entrustment; second, the assembly’s rejoicing. The first has three: (1) the Tathāgata entrusts; (2) the bodhisattvas receive; (3) when the matter is complete he proclaims the dismissal. The first again has three: (1) direct entrustment, (2) explaining the entrustment, (3) admonitory entrustment. Direct entrustment: the Buddha, with the skillful hand of expedient wisdom, touches the crowns of the bodhisattvas of real wisdom who fill the side of the void across three thousand three hundred nayuta lands. Because the Tathāgata confers the path to transform others, it is called the hand of expedient wisdom; because the bodhisattvas personally practice and receive the path, it is called the crown of real wisdom. Extending the hand to touch the crown is bodily entrustment. Expedient wisdom approaching real wisdom is mental entrustment. “And he said thus” is verbal entrustment. The text contains the intent of the Four Siddhantas: “I cultivated this hard-to-obtain Dharma for immeasurable kalpas” refers to receiving it from the former Buddha and now entrusting it to you; you should entrust it to others--the inheritance through three times is the World Siddhanta. “With one mind, spread it” is the Siddhanta for Persons. “Widely cause increase” is the Siddhanta of Counteracting. “Benefit” is the Supreme-Meaning Siddhanta. From “why is this” down is explaining the entrustment. “Great compassion” is the Tathāgata’s room; “no stinginess” is the Tathāgata’s robe; “no fear” is the Tathāgata’s seat. “The Buddha’s wisdom” is all-knowledge; “the Tathāgata’s wisdom” is knowledge of the paths; “natural wisdom” is all-seed wisdom. In the Tathāgata’s room he can bestow the three kinds of wisdom on beings; and in the seat it is likewise. As such a benefactor he has no stinginess and no fear; you should learn this Dharma of the Tathāgata. This is called explaining the Buddha’s intent and entrusting it. From “in future ages” down is the admonitory entrustment: if roots are deep and wisdom sharp, directly preach the Buddha-wisdom; if they are not capable, then in other deep dharmas instruct, teach, benefit, and gladden. Buddha-wisdom is deep and not “other”; the six expedients are “other” and not deep; the Distinct teaching’s sequential stages are “other” and also deep. If you can use the “other”[10] deep to assist in proclaiming Buddha-wisdom, then you skillfully repay the Buddha’s kindness; this is called admonitory entrustment.**

**From “then the bodhisattvas” down is the second: receiving. The mind receives in joy; “bending the body and lowering the head” is bodily receiving; “all speak together” is verbal receiving, and it also includes mental receiving. “As the World-Honored One commands” receives the great benefactor’s intent of the Tathāgata’s room; “we will fully carry it out” receives the intent of the Tathāgata’s robe of no stinginess; “we pray that you have no concern” receives the intent of the Tathāgata’s seat of no fear. The Buddha entrusts three times; the bodhisattvas receive three times, all as in the text.**

**From “at that time Śākyamuni” down is the third: proclaiming the dismissal. Many Treasures came to certify the sutra; now the two gates of trace and origin are complete, so he must be respectfully sent back as before. The emanation bodies assembled for the opening of the stupa; when the opening is finished, the emanation bodies return to their origin. The stupa cannot be opened again, so the emanation bodies leave and do not appear; the stupa still listens to the Dharma, so it is closed yet remains.**

**From “when these words were spoken” down is the great assembly’s rejoicing. The Buddhas rejoice because the work of transforming others is fulfilled; the bodhisattvas rejoice because they themselves have obtained the Dharma. Moreover, they rejoice because the speaker is pure--that is the Buddha; they rejoice because the heard Dharma is pure--that is the wondrous sutra; they rejoice because hearing the Dharma brings realization--that is those in the present and future who obtain benefit. With these three matters complete, there is great rejoicing (and so forth).**

**《觀經》曰「昔名星光，從尊者日藏聞說佛慧，以雪山上藥供養眾僧，願我未來能治眾生身心兩病，舉世歡喜號曰藥王。」此文明一切眾生喜見，頓捨一身[1]復燒兩臂，輕生重法命殞道存，舉昔顯今，故言「本事品」也。若推此義，星光應在喜見之後，從捨藥發誓已來名藥王故(云云)。此下五品皆是化他流通，今品明化他之師，唯願大法大得弘宣，大願眾生獲大饒益，所以竭其神力盡其形命，殷殷虔虔志猶未已，庶令弟子宗法如師，我傳爾明、爾復傳明，明明無已師之志也，故知此品勗弘法之師也。下如〈妙音〉、〈觀音〉兩品，明他方大士奉命弘經，普現色身形無定準，不可牛羊眼看，不可以凡庸識度，於所聞處勿生輕想，輕想則法不染心，故[2]知下品勗受法弟子也。有人言，上諸品諸佛為佛事，此品下菩薩為佛事。此一往耳，上品亦有菩薩，此下品亦有諸佛(云云)。今明〈方便品〉開三顯一圓因已竟，〈安樂行品〉明乘乘之法，〈壽量〉明乘果已竟，此品下明乘乘之人，故《十二門論》云「大乘者，普賢、文殊大人之所乘也」，〈藥王〉以苦行乘乘，〈妙音〉、〈觀音〉以三昧乘乘，〈陀羅尼〉以總持乘乘，〈妙莊嚴〉以誓願乘乘，〈普賢〉以神通乘乘，作此解者，於化他流通義便也。**

**The *Contemplation Sutra* says: “Formerly named Starlight, I heard the Buddha-wisdom from the venerable Sun-Store. With herbs from the Snow Mountains I offered to the assembled saṅgha, and I vowed that in the future I would be able to heal beings’ two illnesses of body and mind. The whole world rejoiced and called [me] Medicine King.” This text clarifies All-Beings-Rejoice: suddenly he relinquished one body and then burned both arms, valuing life lightly and the Dharma heavily; life perished and the Way remained. It cites the past to illuminate the present, therefore it is called the “Past Deeds” chapter. If we push this meaning, Starlight should come after All-Beings-Rejoice, since he was named Medicine King from the time he vowed after offering the medicine (and so forth). The five chapters below are all circulation through transforming others. This chapter clarifies the teacher who transforms others: he only wishes that the great Dharma be greatly proclaimed and that beings obtain great benefit. Therefore he exhausts his spiritual power and his bodily life, earnest and reverent, his resolve not yet ended. He hopes that disciples will honor the Dharma like the teacher: I transmit and you make it bright; you transmit and make it bright; bright and bright without end--this is the teacher’s resolve. Thus we know this chapter exhorts the teachers who propagate the Dharma. The following chapters, such as “Wonderful Sound” and “Avalokiteśvara,” clarify great beings from other lands who accept the command to propagate the sutra, universally manifesting form bodies with no fixed standard. One must not look with the eyes of oxen and sheep, nor measure with ordinary consciousness. Wherever one hears, do not give rise to light thoughts; if one gives rise to light thoughts, the Dharma does not permeate the mind. Therefore[2] we know the chapters below exhort the disciples who receive the Dharma. Some say: in the chapters above, the Buddhas do the Buddha’s work; from this chapter down, the bodhisattvas do the Buddha’s work. This is only one pass; the chapters above also have bodhisattvas, and the chapters below also have Buddhas (and so forth). Now, the “Skillful Means” chapter has opened the three and revealed the one, completing the perfect cause; the “Peaceful Practices” chapter clarifies the Dharma of vehicles and vehicles; the “Lifespan” chapter clarifies that the fruit of the vehicle is complete. From this chapter down it clarifies the persons of the vehicles and vehicles. Therefore the *Twelve Gate Treatise* says, “The Great Vehicle is what great persons such as Samantabhadra and Mañjuśrī ride.” “Medicine King” rides with ascetic practice; “Wonderful Sound” and “Avalokiteśvara” ride with samadhi; “Dharani” rides with total retention; “Wonderful Adornment” rides with vows; “Samantabhadra” rides with spiritual powers. Interpreting it this way fits the meaning of circulation through transforming others.**

**The text has four: (1) question, (2) answer, (3) benefits, (4) Many Treasures praising goodness. The question has three: (1) a general question about traveling and transforming, (2) a specific question about ascetic practice, (3) a request for an answer, as in the text. The answer has two: (1) only answering about ascetic practice--traveling and transforming then refers to the samadhi of manifesting form bodies, or perhaps to the two following chapters; (2) praising the sutra. In answering the ascetic practice, first it clarifies the present basis; next it clarifies the past event and the present basis[3], in three--the time period, the Buddha, śrāvakas, lands, and so forth, all as in the text. The past event has three: (1) the Buddha preaches the Dharma, (2) cultivating offerings, (3) concluding the meeting. Yet the Buddha is universal for all; why only All-Beings-Rejoice? This is to highlight him[4], needing to entrust circulation, like Śāriputra now is used as a proxy for all. Ascetic practice is again two: (1) present, (2) future. The present again has two: (1) cultivating and obtaining the Dharma, (2) forming the thought of repaying kindness. Repaying kindness is again two: (1) the power of samadhi, (2) the power of the retribution body. The power of the body has three: (1) burning the body, (2) the Buddha’s praise, (3) the time period. “True Dharma offerings” means internally directing wisdom-contemplation to contemplate the causes and fruits of afflictions and sweep them all away with the wisdom of emptiness; therefore it is called true Dharma. Further, contemplate: if the body, if the fire, the one who offers and that which is offered are all real suchness, who burns, who burns? The one who offers and that which is offered are all unattainable, therefore it is called true Dharma. From “all beings” down, the future ascetic practice is again five: (1) being born in a royal household, (2) telling the past deeds, (3) going to the Buddha, (4) the Tathāgata’s entrustment, (5) receiving the command and maintaining it. All as in the text. Maintaining it is again four: (1) raising a stupa, (2) burning the arm, (3) benefit, (4) present retribution. All as in the text. From “the Buddha told” down is the third: concluding past and present. It again has two: (1) concluding, (2) exhorting practice. Exhorting practice: to burn a single finger surpasses giving up the external body; because the external is light and the internal is heavy, merits and blessings differ. The text says “wife and children” are the external body; “country and city” and so forth are external wealth. From “if again there is[5] someone who uses the seven treasures” down, it praises the sutra: first praising those who can uphold it, next praising the Dharma that is upheld, and afterward clarifying the deep blessings of upholding. Offering the seven treasures to the four holy ones is not as good as upholding one verse; the Dharma is the holy teacher, able to give birth, nourish, complete, and glorify--nothing surpasses the Dharma, therefore people are light and the Dharma is heavy. From “King of Constellations” down, second, it praises the Dharma that is upheld, again in two: first, praising the Dharma’s substance; next, praising the Dharma’s function. “Among streams, rivers, and all waters, the sea is first”--the *Sutra of Infinite Meaning* says, “The four waters are a simile for teachings; in the parable of medicinal herbs, one cloud able to rain is the simile for preaching.” Now, with all waters summing all teachings and separately raising four, it parallels the four-flavor teachings of milk, curd, fresh butter, and cooked butter. This Lotus teaching is like the sea of ghee: it speaks to the farthest origin-ground and is “deep”; it pervades all places and is “great”; it purely clarifies Buddha-dharma without speaking other dharmas and is “salty.” “Most deep and great” has this meaning. The names of the ten jeweled mountains come from the *Avatamsaka* and other sutras (and so forth). The mountains of earth, black, and iron enclosure are not jewels. Though the ten mountains are jeweled, one or two divine dragons dwell mixed within them. Sumeru is composed of four jewels and purely inhabited by devas; this parallels other teachings that explain reliance on ten grounds and forty minds, or on ordinary, worthy, or sage persons, and on the conventional, the true, or the middle--this is low[6]. The *Lotus Sutra* explains the truth-principle of constant bliss, self, and purity, as if composed of four jewels, relied upon by those who open, reveal, awaken, and enter; therefore this meaning is most lofty. Stars and moon are both yin essence and appear together at night; the stars have no waxing or waning and do not reach the moon. The other sutras explain provisional wisdom without attaining self-mastery; this sutra clarifies that the provisional is precisely the real and the real is precisely the provisional. Waxing and waning point to each other, not two yet two; thus its explanation of provisional wisdom surpasses the other teachings. The sun is yang essence and alone can break darkness. The other sutras explain real wisdom breaking delusion, yet still do not reach “the real as provisional”; how could they also reach “the provisional as real”? Thus we know this sutra’s explanation of real wisdom is the foremost. The Wheel-Turning King’s command only reaches the four[7] continents; Indra’s reaches the Thirty-Three; Brahma’s command encompasses above and below. This parallels other sutras that explain the three truths and samadhis as each not taking in the others, unable to attain self-mastery. What this sutra teaches: by real suchness entering the true, it decisively clarifies the śrāvaka dharma--it is the king of the sutras. Real suchness entering the conventional: all livelihoods and industries are not in conflict. Real suchness entering the middle: there is no dharma that is not Buddha-dharma. The text says, “the father of all learners and non-learners and those who have aroused the bodhisattva mind,” and its meaning is thus. “First among all ordinary beings, the four fruits, and pratyekabuddhas” clarifies effortless, non-fabricated functioning. Other sutras require effort to enter the stream; for example, those of the four fruits only awaken by hearing, thinking, and cultivating. This sutra clarifies the unmade Four Truths without mixed expedients, naturally flowing into the ocean of omniscience, like a great white ox, fat and strong, swift as the wind (and so forth). “Śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas are first” clarifies the firstness of the cause. Other sutras clarify the cause as the seven expedients; this sutra clarifies the cause beyond expedients, therefore the cause is first. “The Tathāgata is first” clarifies the fruit. Other sutras clarify the fruit as near, in the stilling ground; this sutra clarifies the fruit as far, pointing to the origin-ground, therefore it is most first. From “this sutra can save” down, it praises the Dharma’s function: first it praises the function of removing suffering; next it praises the function of giving joy in twelve ways; afterward it concludes. All as in the text. From “if a person[1] obtains hearing” down, it clarifies that the blessings of upholding the sutra are deep. First it raises the blessings of fully hearing the[2] sutra; next it raises the blessings of hearing a chapter. There are measurements and entrustments, as in the text. Fragrance from the mouth is present retribution; the rest are later retributions. To obtain hearing of this sutra and not age or die must be understood by contemplation: not aging is bliss, not dying is permanence. Hearing this sutra gives the understanding of permanence and bliss, resting in the heart with no fear or avoidance.**

**Explanation of the "Wonderful Sound Bodhisattva" Chapter**

**文中自釋，昔奉雲雷音王佛十萬種[3]妓，今遊化[4]他土音樂自隨；昔奉八萬四千寶鉢，今爾許道器眷屬圍遶；昔得一切眾生語言陀羅尼，今以普現色身，以妙音聲遍吼十方弘宣此教，故名「妙音品」。此品明菩薩以難思之力，隨類通經，物覩其迹莫測其本，但甘其味無擇其形，當卑其地自壅其流，即是化他門中第二意也。**

**The text explains itself: formerly he offered ten thousand kinds of music[3] to the Buddha Cloud-Thunder-Sound King; now as he travels and transforms[4] other lands, music follows him. Formerly he offered eighty-four thousand jeweled bowls; now that many Dharma instruments and retinues surround him. Formerly he obtained the dharani of all beings’ languages; now with universally manifested bodies and wondrous sounds he roars throughout the ten directions to widely proclaim this teaching, therefore it is called the “Wonderful Sound” chapter. This chapter clarifies that the bodhisattva, by inconceivable power, accords with types and communicates the sutra; beings see his traces and cannot measure his origin. They only savor the flavor without selecting the form; they should lower their ground and block their own flow. This is the second meaning in the gate of transforming others.**

**文為六：一、放光東召，二、奉命西來，三、十方弘經，四、二土得益，五、還歸本國，六、聞品進道。「大人相」者大相海也。遍體[5]毛功德不及一好功德，眾好功德不及一相功德，諸相從下向上展轉相勝不及[6]白毫功德，[＊6-1]白毫功德不及肉髻功德，故是大人相也。此相業者從孝順師長起，今放是光召本弟子，使弘中道之經利益大機者也。[＊6-2]白毫從一道清淨起，今放此光令弘此法也。**

**The text has six parts: (1) emitting light to summon from the east, (2) receiving the command and coming from the west, (3) propagating the sutra in the ten directions, (4) benefits in the two lands, (5) returning to the original country, (6) advancing on the path by hearing the chapter. “The great person’s mark” is the ocean of great marks. The merit of the body’s[5] hairs does not equal the merit of a single fine mark; the merits of the fine marks do not equal the merit of a single major mark; the major marks, ascending from lower to higher and surpassing each other, still do not equal the merit of the white ūrṇā;[＊6-1] the merit of the white ūrṇā does not equal the merit of the flesh topknot. Therefore it is a mark of a great person. The karma of this mark arises from filial obedience to teachers and elders. Now he releases this light to summon his original disciples, causing them to propagate the Middle Way sutra and benefit great capacities.[＊6-2] The white ūrṇā arises from a single pure path; now he releases this light to cause propagation of this Dharma.**

**問：**

**Question:**

---

**佛一一相皆法界海，何故勝負？**

**Each of the Buddha’s marks is a dharma-realm ocean; why are there victories and defeats?**

---

**答：**

**Answer:**

---

**他經所明宜作此說耳。**

**This explanation is appropriate for what other sutras clarify.**

---

**問：**

**Question:**

---

**佛有緣弟子布滿十方，何故召東說西，不論八方耶？**

**The Buddha has disciples with affinities spread through the ten directions; why speak of summoning from the east and coming from the west, and not discuss the eight directions?**

---

**答：此有所表，《淨名》云「日月何意行閻浮提，欲以光明除眾闇瞑。東是光始、西是其終，有始有終其唯聖人乎。」未發心者令其發心，未究竟者令其究竟，一菩薩既爾諸眾亦然，一方既爾諸方亦然，聖不煩文舉一蔽諸，故但言東西耳。**

**Answer: this has a symbol. The *Vimalakirti* says, “Why do the sun and moon move over Jambudvīpa? They wish by their light to remove the many darknesses. The east is the beginning of light, the west is its end. Having a beginning and an end--is that not only the sages?” Those who have not yet aroused the mind are made to arouse it; those not yet complete are made complete. If one bodhisattva is so, all beings are also so; if one direction is so, all directions are also so. The sage does not belabor the text; he raises one to cover all, therefore he only speaks of east and west.**

**發來，文為二：一、發來緣，二、正發來。來緣為六：一、經家敘其福慧，二、被照，三、辭，四、誡，五、受旨，六、現來相。敘福之由，由值先佛多也。「甚深智慧」即智慧莊嚴，十六三昧即福德莊嚴也。**

**As for the coming, the text has two: (1) the conditions for coming, (2) the direct coming. The conditions for coming are six: (1) the sutra-compilers narrate his blessings and wisdom, (2) he is illuminated, (3) he takes leave, (4) admonition, (5) receiving the command, (6) manifesting the coming signs. The reason for narrating his blessings is that he met many former Buddhas. “Very deep wisdom” is the adornment of wisdom; the sixteen samadhis are the adornment of merit.**

---

**光照身、辭佛，悉如文。**

**The light illuminating his body and taking leave of the Buddha are all as in the text.**

---

**佛誡者，然法身大士故不肅而成，所將眷屬或未達者，故寄彼而規此耳。夫佛身與理相稱，不得見卑小而忘其尊嚴，此約如來座為誡也。夫師及弟子智斷具足，師既施權、弟子亦隱其實，此約如來衣為誡也。夫依報國土皆正報所感，如來以慈臨大千，宜須高須下，勿覩依報而忽正報也，此約如來室為誡也。此佛弘經亦勅三意，彼尊誡約諸佛道同也。受旨者，「如來力」是座力，「神通力」是室力，「莊嚴力」是衣力，此受弘經之大旨利物之宗要，故能不動此會，遊化十方焉。**

**As for the Buddha’s admonition: since he is a great bodhisattva of the Dharma-body, he accomplishes without formality; yet the retinue he brings may not have reached this level, so he uses that to admonish this. The Buddha-body corresponds with principle; one must not see the low or small and forget its dignity--this admonishes in terms of the Tathāgata’s seat. The teacher and disciples are complete in wisdom and severing; when the teacher bestows the provisional, the disciples also conceal the real--this admonishes in terms of the Tathāgata’s robe. The lands of dependent retribution are all evoked by the principal retribution; the Tathāgata, with compassion, comes to the great thousand, and one should regard high and low appropriately; do not see the dependent retribution and neglect the principal retribution--this admonishes in terms of the Tathāgata’s room. This Buddha’s propagation of the sutra also commands these three intents; that honored admonition refers to all Buddhas’ paths being the same. As for receiving the command: “the Tathāgata’s power” is the power of the seat; “the power of spiritual penetrations” is the power of the room; “the power of adornment” is the power of the robe. This is receiving the great intent of propagating the sutra and the essential aim of benefiting beings; therefore he can leave this assembly unmoved and travel to transform the ten directions.**

**若文殊位下，辭不應求見，若文殊位高相來，那忽不識？**

**答：雖同一位，有始、中、終，止此一事不知，無忝高位；[7]又眾中見瑞不了，發起令知，故問佛耳。**

**Answer: Though they are at the same level, there is a beginning, middle, and end; for this one matter not to be known does not disgrace a high position.[7] Moreover, among the assembly they saw the auspicious sign and did not understand it; to arouse them to know, he questioned the Buddha.**

**第三，弘經為二：問、答。初、問種何善根，二、問有是神力。善根是問昔，神力是問今。佛還答二意，昔獻樂奉器仍結古今，悉如文，此答其種善根之問。從「華德」下，答其神力之問。[9]示三十四凡身四聖人身，結成十法界六道耳。「爾時華德」下，是問今住何定而能如此自在利益，佛答如文。**

**Third, propagating the sutra has two: question and answer. First, he asks what good roots were planted; second, he asks about such spiritual powers. The good roots question asks about the past; the spiritual powers question asks about the present. The Buddha answers both: formerly he offered music and presented vessels and still links past and present; all as in the text--this answers the question about planting good roots. From “Huade” down, he answers the question about spiritual powers.[9] He manifests thirty-four bodies of ordinary beings and four bodies of sages, forming the ten dharma realms and the six paths. From “at that time Huade” down, he asks what samadhi he now abides in to be able to benefit so freely; the Buddha answers as in the text.**

**「說是品」下，是第四，二土利益。三昧與陀羅尼，體一而用異，寂用為三昧、持用名陀羅尼。又色身變現名三昧、音聲辯說名陀羅尼。上品云「初得一切色身三昧轉身、得一切語言陀羅尼」，當知音聲猶是色法，故言體一用異。又舌根清淨名陀羅尼，餘根清淨名三昧，都是六根清淨法門耳。**

**From “when this chapter was explained” down is the fourth: benefits in the two lands. samadhi and dharani are one in substance but differ in function: the function of quiescence is samadhi; the function of holding is called dharani. Further, the transformation of form bodies is called samadhi; eloquent sound and speech is called dharani. The above chapter says, “First he attained the samadhi of all form bodies and transformed his body; he attained the dharani of all languages.” You should know that sound is still a dharma of form; therefore it is said that the substance is one and the functions differ. Further, purity of the tongue root is called dharani; purity of the other roots is called samadhi. All are the dharma gate of six-root purity.**

**「爾時妙音」下，第五，還本土。「動地雨花」者，菩薩[＊8-1]經歷尚能傍益，[10]況佛前放光，傍照東方百八萬億那由他土，亦傍論利益也。**

**From “at that time Wonderful Sound” down is the fifth: returning to his original land. “The earth moved and flowers rained” means that even in the bodhisattva’s[＊8-1] travel there are still incidental benefits;[10] how much more when light is emitted before the Buddha, incidentally illuminating one hundred and eight myriads of nayuta lands in the east--this also counts as incidental benefit.**

**此品是當途王經，講者甚眾，今之解釋不與他同，別有《私記》兩卷，略撮彼。釋此題，有通有別，通有十雙、別有五隻。十雙者，一人法乃至第十智斷(云云)。「觀世音」者人也，「普門」者法也。人有多種(云云)，法有多種(云云)。依前問答論觀世音人，依後問答論普門法，人法合題故言「觀世音普門品」。(二)「觀世音」者大悲拔苦，依前問答，百千苦惱皆得解脫；「普門」者大慈與樂，依後問答，應以得度而為說法也。(三)「觀世音」者智慧莊嚴，智能斷惑如明時無闇；「普門」者福德莊嚴，福能轉壽如珠雨寶者也。(四)「觀世音」者觀冥於境，即法身也；「普門」者隨所應現，即應身也。(五)「觀世音」者，譬藥樹王遍體愈病；「普門」者，譬如意珠王隨意所與。(六)「觀世音」者，冥作利益無所見聞，三毒七難皆離，二求兩願皆滿也；「普門者」，顯作利益，目覩三十三聖容，耳聞十九尊教也。(七)「觀世音」者，隨自意照實智也；「普門」者，隨於他意照權智也。(八)「觀世音」者，不動本際也「普門」者，迹任方圓也(九)「觀世音」者，根本是了因種[1]子；「普門」者，根本是緣因種子也。(十)「觀世音」者，究竟是智德，如十四夜月光也；「普門」者，究竟是斷德，如二十九夜月[2]邪輝將盡也。經文兩問答含無量義，略用十雙，始從人法終至智斷，釋品通名，其義如是。別論五隻者，一、「觀」也。觀有多種，謂析觀、體觀、次第觀、圓觀。析觀者滅色入空也；體觀者即色是空也；次第觀者，從析觀乃至圓觀也；圓觀者，即析觀是實相，乃至次第觀亦實相也。今簡三觀唯論圓觀，文云「普門」，觀若不圓，門不稱普，即此義也。「世」者，若就於行先世後觀，若就言說先觀後世，今從說便故後論世。世亦多種，謂有為世、無為世、二邊世、不思議世。有為世者三界世也，無為世者二涅槃也，二邊世者生死涅槃也，不思議世者實相境也。簡却諸世但取不思議世也。「音」者機也，機亦多種，人天機、二乘機、菩薩機、佛機。人天機者，諸惡莫作諸善奉行也；二乘機者，厭畏生死欣尚無為也；菩薩機者，先人後己慈悲仁讓也；佛機者，一切諸法中悉以等觀入，一切無礙人，一道出生死也。揀却諸音之機，唯取佛音之機而設應，以此機應因緣故，名「觀世音」也。「普」者周遍也，諸法無量，若不得普則是偏法，若得普者則是圓法，故《思益》云「一切法[＊2-1]邪、一切法正」，略約十法明普，得此意已類一切法無不是普，所謂慈悲普、弘誓普、修行普、離惑普、入法門普、神通普、方便普、說法普、成就眾生普、供養諸佛普，始自人天終至菩薩皆有慈悲，然有普有不普。生法兩緣慈體既偏，被緣不廣不得稱普；無緣與實相體同，其理既圓慈靡不遍。如[3]磁石吸鐵任運相應，如此慈悲遍薰一[4]切，名慈悲普。弘誓普者，弘廣也、誓制也，廣制要心故言弘誓。弘誓約四諦起，若約有作無生無量四諦者，收法不盡不名為普；若約無作四諦者，名弘誓普也。修行普者，例如佛未值定光佛前凡有所修不與理合，從得記已觸事即理，理智歷法而修[5]行者，無行而不普也。斷惑普者，若用一切智、道種智，斷四住塵沙等惑，如却枝條，不名斷惑普；若用一切種智斷無明者，五住皆盡如除根本，名斷惑普。入法門普者，道前名修方便，道後所入名入法門。若二乘以一心入一定，一心作一不得眾多，又為定所縛，故不名普；若歷別諸地淺深階差，亦不名普；若入王三昧，一切三昧悉入其中，不起滅定現諸威儀，故名法門普。神通普者，大羅漢天眼照大千，支佛照百佛世界，菩薩照恒沙世界，皆緣境狹發通亦偏；若緣實相修者，一發一切發，相似神通[6]如上說，況真神通而非普耶？方便普者二種，道前方便修行中攝，道後又二：一者法體，如入法門中說；二者化用，如今說，逗機利物稱適緣宜一時圓遍，雖復種種運為，於法性實際而無損減，是名方便普。說法普者，能以一妙音，稱十[7]法界機，隨其宜類俱令解脫，如修羅琴，故名說法普。成就眾生普者，一切世間及出世間所有事業，皆菩薩所為，鑿井造舟神農甞藥雲蔭日照利益眾生，乃至利益一切賢聖，示教利喜令入三菩提，是名成就眾生普。供養諸佛普者，若作外事供養，以一時一食一花一香普供養一切佛，無前無後一時等供，於一塵中出種種塵亦復如是；若作內觀者，圓智導眾行，圓智名為佛，眾行資圓智，即是供養佛，若行資餘智，不名供養普，眾行資圓智，是名供養普。門者，從假入空空通而假壅，從空入假假通而空壅，偏通則非普，壅故非門；中道非空非假，正通實相雙照二諦故名普，正通故名門。普門圓通義則無量，略舉其十類則可知。此品猶是普現三昧化他流通也。**

**This chapter is a kingly sutra on the main road; many expound it. Our explanation does not match others; there is a separate *Private Notes* in two juan, from which we extract briefly. Explaining this title has a general and a specific aspect. The general has ten pairs; the specific has five items. The ten pairs range from person and Dharma to the tenth, wisdom and severing (and so forth). “Avalokiteśvara” is the person; “Universal Gate” is the Dharma. There are many kinds of persons (and so forth); there are many kinds of Dharma (and so forth). Based on the earlier questions and answers, we discuss the person Avalokiteśvara; based on the later questions and answers, we discuss the Dharma of the Universal Gate. Combining person and Dharma as the title, it is called the “Universal Gate of Avalokiteśvara” chapter. (2) “Avalokiteśvara” is great compassion removing suffering; per the earlier questions and answers, hundreds of thousands of sufferings and troubles are all liberated. “Universal Gate” is great kindness giving joy; per the later questions and answers, he preaches according to what is needed for liberation. (3) “Avalokiteśvara” is wisdom adornment; wisdom can sever delusion like daylight without darkness. “Universal Gate” is merit adornment; merit can extend lifespan like a jewel raining treasures. (4) “Avalokiteśvara” is contemplation hidden in the object, namely the Dharma-body. “Universal Gate” is manifesting according to what is needed, namely the response body. (5) “Avalokiteśvara” is like the King of Medicinal Trees, healing illnesses throughout the body. “Universal Gate” is like the King of Wish-Fulfilling Jewels, giving according to desire. (6) “Avalokiteśvara” secretly benefits with no seeing or hearing; the three poisons and seven difficulties are all removed, and the two seekings and two vows are all fulfilled. “Universal Gate,” by contrast, openly benefits: the eyes see the thirty-three holy forms, the ears hear the teachings of nineteen honored ones. (7) “Avalokiteśvara” is illuminating real wisdom according to one’s own intent; “Universal Gate” is illuminating provisional wisdom according to others’ intent. (8) “Avalokiteśvara” is not moving the original boundary; “Universal Gate” is the traces freely adapting to square and round. (9) “Avalokiteśvara”: the root is the seed[1] of understanding as cause; “Universal Gate”: the root is the seed of conditions as cause. (10) “Avalokiteśvara” ultimately is the virtue of wisdom, like the moonlight of the fourteenth night; “Universal Gate” ultimately is the virtue of severing, like the light of the twenty-ninth night[2] as the moon wanes. The two rounds of questions and answers in the sutra contain immeasurable meanings; using the ten pairs in brief, starting from person and Dharma and ending with wisdom and severing, we explain the general title of the chapter--its meaning is thus. In specific, there are five items. First, “contemplation.” There are many kinds of contemplation: analytic contemplation, essential contemplation, sequential contemplation, and perfect contemplation. Analytic contemplation is extinguishing form and entering emptiness. Essential contemplation is form itself as emptiness. Sequential contemplation is from analytic to perfect. Perfect contemplation is that analytic contemplation itself is real suchness, and even sequential contemplation is real suchness. Now we set aside the three contemplations and discuss only perfect contemplation. The text says “Universal Gate”; if contemplation is not perfect, the gate is not called universal--this is its meaning. “World”: in terms of practice, first world then contemplation; in terms of speech, first contemplation then world. Now following ease of expression, we discuss world afterward. The world is also many: the conditioned world, the unconditioned world, the two-extremes world, the inconceivable world. The conditioned world is the world of the three realms; the unconditioned world is the two nirvāṇas; the two-extremes world is birth-and-death and nirvāṇa; the inconceivable world is the realm of real suchness. We set aside the various worlds and take only the inconceivable world. “Sound” means capacities, and capacities are many: human-and-heavenly capacities, the two-vehicle capacities, bodhisattva capacities, and Buddha capacities. Human-and-heavenly capacities are: do no evil and practice all good. Two-vehicle capacities are: detesting birth-and-death and delighting in the unconditioned. Bodhisattva capacities are: putting others before self, with compassion and humility. Buddha capacities are: in all dharmas, enter equally with observation; all people are unobstructed, and the one path leads out of birth-and-death. We set aside the capacities of the various “sounds,” and take only the Buddha-sound capacity to establish response. Because of the causal conditions of capacity and response, it is named “Avalokiteśvara.” “Universal” means pervading. Dharmas are immeasurable; if one does not attain the universal, it is a partial dharma; if one attains the universal, it is the Perfect Dharma. Therefore the *Si Yi* says, “All dharmas are[＊2-1] deviant; all dharmas are correct.” Briefly, we use ten dharmas to clarify universality. Once this meaning is obtained, it follows that there is no dharma that is not universal: universal compassion, universal great vows, universal practice, universal severing of delusion, universal entry into Dharma-gates, universal spiritual powers, universal expedients, universal preaching of Dharma, universal fulfillment of beings, universal offerings to the Buddhas. From humans and devas up to bodhisattvas, all have compassion, yet some are universal and some are not. The compassion based on the two conditions of beings and dharmas is partial in its substance, and its objects are not broad, so it cannot be called universal. Compassion without conditions is identical in substance with real suchness; since its principle is perfect, its compassion pervades all. Like a[3] magnet attracting iron spontaneously, such compassion universally perfumes all[4], and is called universal compassion. “Universal great vows”: “great” means broad, “vow” means restraining; broadly restraining the essential mind is called great vows. Great vows arise in terms of the Four Truths. If in terms of the conditioned, non-arising, and immeasurable Four Truths, the included dharmas are not exhaustive and are not called universal; if in terms of the unmade Four Truths, they are called universal great vows. “Universal practice”: for example, before the Buddha met Dīpaṃkara, whatever he practiced did not accord with principle; from the time he received the prediction, encountering affairs was immediately principle. Those who practice with principle and wisdom through the dharmas have no practice that is not universal. “Universal severing of delusion”: if one uses all-knowledge and knowledge of the paths to sever the delusions of the four abodes and dust-like delusions, it is like cutting branches and is not called universal severing of delusion. If one uses all-seed wisdom to sever ignorance, all five abodes are exhausted like removing the root; this is called universal severing of delusion. “Universal entry into Dharma-gates”: before the path it is called cultivating expedients; after the path what is entered is called entry into Dharma-gates. If the two vehicles enter one samadhi with one mind, making one as one and not attaining the many, and are bound by that samadhi, it is not called universal. If they traverse distinct grounds of shallow and deep in stages, it is also not universal. If one enters the king of samadhis, all samadhis enter within it; without rising from the cessation samadhi one manifests all deportments, therefore it is called universal entry into Dharma-gates. “Universal spiritual powers”: great arhats’ heavenly eye illuminates a great thousand; pratyekabuddhas illuminate a hundred Buddha-worlds; bodhisattvas illuminate worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges. All have a narrow object and thus their spiritual powers are partial. If one cultivates in relation to real suchness, with one arousing all are aroused; semblance spiritual powers are as described above[6]--how much more true spiritual powers are not universal? “Universal expedients” are two kinds: before the path, expedients are included within cultivation and practice; after the path there are two: one is the Dharma substance, as spoken in the entry into Dharma-gates; the other is transformative function, as spoken now. Meeting capacities and benefiting beings, fitting conditions and appropriateness, all at once perfectly pervading, though of many kinds, in the dharma-nature’s real boundary there is no loss or decrease--this is called universal expedients. “Universal preaching of Dharma”: one can use one wondrous sound to accord with the capacities of the ten[7] dharma realms, and according to their appropriateness, all are liberated, like the asura’s lute; therefore it is called universal preaching of Dharma. “Universal fulfillment of beings”: all enterprises in the world and beyond are done by the bodhisattvas--digging wells, making boats, Shennong tasting herbs, cloud shade and sun shining benefit beings, up to benefiting all sages and saints, instructing, teaching, benefiting, and gladdening them, causing entry into supreme bodhi--this is called universal fulfillment of beings. “Universal offerings to the Buddhas”: if one makes external offerings, with one time, one meal, one flower, one incense, one universally offers to all Buddhas; without before or after, one offers equally at one time, and from one mote of dust one produces many motes of dust, likewise. If one makes internal contemplation, perfect wisdom guides the myriad practices; perfect wisdom is called Buddha; the myriad practices support perfect wisdom--this is offering to the Buddha. If practices support other wisdom, it is not called universal offering; if the myriad practices support perfect wisdom, it is called universal offering. “Gate”: from the provisional entering emptiness, emptiness is open and the provisional is blocked; from emptiness entering the provisional, the provisional is open and emptiness is blocked. Partial opening is not universal; because of blockage it is not a gate. The middle way is neither empty nor provisional; it is precisely open to real suchness, illuminating the two truths together, therefore it is called universal. Because it is precisely open, it is called a gate. The meaning of universal gate and perfect penetration is immeasurable; by briefly raising these ten types it can be known. This chapter is still the circulation of transforming others by the samadhi of universal manifestation.**

**文為三：一、問，二、答，三、聞品得益。問、答兩番。初番問為二：初、經家敘時者，說東方菩薩竟，次說西方菩薩時也(其一)。說東方生善竟，次說西方生善時(其二)。說東方斷疑竟，次說西方斷疑時(其三)。說東方得道竟，次說西方得道時(其四)。「無盡意」者，《大品》明空則無盡，《大集》明八十無盡門，《淨名》云「夫無盡者，非盡非無盡故名無盡」。總三經，用三觀三智，釋無盡也。「意」者智也，「無盡」者境也。智契於境，單從於境應言無盡，單從於智應言於意，境智合稱故言「無盡意」也。[1](一)又意者，世出世之本也。(二)又意即法界中道，故言能觀心性名為上定。(三)此約三智三觀釋名也。興問者，《大經》云「具二莊嚴能問能答」。無盡意前以慧莊嚴問觀世音慧莊嚴，佛以慧莊嚴答觀世音慧莊嚴也。佛答為三：一、總答，二、別答，三、勸持名答。總為四：一、人數，二、遭苦，三、聞名稱號，四、得解脫。自有多苦，苦一人、多人受一苦、一人受多苦、一人受少苦。今文百千萬億眾生，多人也；受諸苦惱，多苦也。舉多顯少，多尚能救況少苦耶！遭苦是惡、稱名是善，善惡合為機義也。「而得解脫」是應也，此是機感因緣名觀世音，亦是人法因緣乃至智斷因緣名觀世音。後去例如此結名，不煩文。**

**The text has three: (1) question, (2) answer, (3) benefits from hearing the chapter. There are two rounds of questions and answers. The first round’s question has two parts. First, the sutra-compilers narrate the time: after speaking of the eastern bodhisattva, it is the time of speaking of the western bodhisattva (first). After the eastern one produces good, it is time for the western one to produce good (second). After the eastern one cuts off doubts, it is time for the western one to cut off doubts (third). After the eastern one attains the path, it is time for the western one to attain the path (fourth). “Inexhaustible Mind”: the *Great Prajna* clarifies emptiness as inexhaustible; the *Great Assembly* clarifies the eighty inexhaustible gates; the *Vimalakirti* says, “The inexhaustible is named inexhaustible because it is neither exhaustible nor inexhaustible.” Summarizing the three sutras, using the three contemplations and three wisdoms, it explains “inexhaustible.” “Mind” is wisdom; “inexhaustible” is the object. When wisdom accords with the object, from the object alone it should be called inexhaustible; from wisdom alone it should be called mind. Because object and wisdom are combined, it is called Inexhaustible Mind.[1] (1) Further, mind is the basis of the mundane and supramundane. (2) Further, mind is the middle way of the dharma-realm; therefore, being able to contemplate mind-nature is called the highest samadhi. (3) This explains the name in terms of the three wisdoms and three contemplations. As for initiating the question, the *Great Sutra* says, “Possessing the two adornments, one can ask and can answer.” Inexhaustible Mind, adorned with wisdom, asks Avalokiteśvara adorned with wisdom; the Buddha, adorned with wisdom, answers Avalokiteśvara adorned with wisdom. The Buddha’s answer has three: (1) a general answer, (2) a specific answer, (3) an answer urging upholding the name. The general answer has four: (1) the number of persons, (2) encountering suffering, (3) hearing the name and title, (4) obtaining liberation. There are many kinds of suffering: one person suffers one suffering; many people suffer one suffering; one person suffers many sufferings; one person suffers few sufferings. In the text, hundreds of thousands of myriads of beings are many people; they suffer various troubles, many sufferings. By raising the many, the few are made manifest. If even the many can be saved, how much more the few sufferings? Encountering suffering is evil; calling the name is good. Good and evil together form the meaning of capacity. “And obtain liberation” is the response. This is called Avalokiteśvara in terms of capacity-response causal conditions; it is also called Avalokiteśvara in terms of person-and-Dharma causal conditions, up to causal conditions of wisdom and severing. The following passages conclude the name likewise and need not be belabored.**

**別答為三：一、口機應，二、意機應，三、身機應。口又二：初、明七難，次、結。火難為四：一、持名是善，二、遭火是惡，三、應，四、結。於一難中例為三番：一、果報火，地獄已上初禪已還皆論機應；二、惡業火，地獄已上非想已還皆論機應；三、煩惱火，地獄已上等覺已還皆論機應。七難三毒二求例皆如此。此義既廣，可以意知不可文記。身機為二：初、二求，次、結。求男有立願修行德業，求女文略修行，正言禮拜是同，故略之；願業各異故重出之。結，如文。**

**The specific answer has three: (1) response to the mouth’s capacity, (2) response to the mind’s capacity, (3) response to the body’s capacity. The mouth has two: first, clarifying the seven difficulties; next, concluding. The fire difficulty has four: (1) upholding the name is good, (2) encountering fire is evil, (3) the response, (4) conclusion. In one difficulty, there are three cases by analogy: (1) karmic-retribution fire--from hell up to the first dhyana, all discussed as capacity-response; (2) evil-karma fire--from hell up to the realm of neither perception nor non-perception, all discussed as capacity-response; (3) affliction fire--from hell up to equal enlightenment, all discussed as capacity-response. The seven difficulties, three poisons, and two seekings are all like this. This meaning is broad; it can be understood by intent and cannot be fully recorded in text. The body’s capacity has two: first, the two seekings; next, the conclusion. Seeking a son includes establishing vows and cultivating merit; seeking a daughter is briefly stated for cultivation, and in fact the prostrations are the same, so it is abbreviated; the vows and deeds differ, therefore they are stated again. The conclusion is as in the text.**

**從「是故眾生」下，是勸持名，為三：勸持、格量、結歎。上述勝名美德不辨形質，若欲歸崇宜持名字，是故勸持也。《入大乘論》云「法身唯一應色則多」，格六十[2]二億應，等一法身也。智者云：「圓人唯一、偏人則多」，格六十二億偏菩薩，等一圓菩薩[3]也。**

**From “therefore beings” down is exhorting to uphold the name, in three: exhorting, measuring, and concluding with praise. The above excellent name and beautiful virtue do not distinguish form or substance; if one wishes to return and revere, one should uphold the name--therefore it exhorts upholding. The *Entering the Great Vehicle Treatise* says, “The Dharma-body is one; response forms are many”; measuring sixty-[2]two kotis of responses is equal to one Dharma-body. The Master Zhizhe says, “For Perfect persons there is one; for partial persons there are many”; measuring sixty-two kotis of partial bodhisattvas equals one Perfect bodhisattva[3].**

**第二番問，為三：「云何遊」問身，「云何說」問口，「方便」問意。此聖人三密無謀之權，隨機適應也。佛答亦三：一、別答，二、總答，三、勸供養。「應以」者，答方便力也；「現身」，答其問遊也；「說法」，答其問口也。凡有三十三身、十九說法(云云)。從「成就」下，結別開總。別文廣意狹，總答文狹意廣(云云)。從「是故」下，勸供養。此中見形聞法，故勸供養[＊3-1]也。初、勸，次、受旨。受旨為六：奉命、不受、重奉、佛勸、即受、結，皆如文。從「持地」下，是聞品功德(云云)。「無等等」者，九法界心不能等理，佛法界心能等此理，故無等而等也。又畢竟之理是無等，初緣畢竟理而發心，能等於理，故言無等等也。又心之與理俱不可得，將何物等何物，而[4]言無等等耶？心之與理俱不可說，不可說而說，說此心等此理，故言無等等耳。初一是橫釋，次一是豎釋，次一非橫非豎釋也(云云)。**

**The second round of questions has three: “How does he travel?” asks the body; “How does he preach?” asks the mouth; “expedients” asks the mind. These are the sage’s three mysteries and uncontrived expedients, responding suitably to capacities. The Buddha’s answer also has three: (1) specific answer, (2) general answer, (3) exhortation to make offerings. “Should use” answers the power of expedients; “manifest a body” answers the question about traveling; “preach the Dharma” answers the question about the mouth. Altogether there are thirty-three bodies and nineteen ways of preaching (and so forth). From “accomplishing” down, he concludes the specific and opens the general. The specific text is broad but the intent is narrow; the general answer’s text is narrow but its intent is broad (and so forth). From “therefore” down, he exhorts offerings. Here one sees the form and hears the Dharma, therefore he exhorts offerings[＊3-1]. First, exhortation; next, receiving the command. Receiving the command has six: accepting the command, not accepting, re-accepting, the Buddha’s exhortation, immediate acceptance, and conclusion--all as in the text. From “Holding the Earth” down are the merits of hearing the chapter (and so forth). “Unequalled” means: the minds of the nine dharma realms cannot equal the principle; the mind of the Buddha-dharma realm can equal this principle, therefore unequal yet equal. Further, the ultimate principle is unequalled; the initial arousing of the mind in relation to the ultimate principle can equal the principle, therefore it is called more-than-unequalled. Further, mind and principle are both unattainable; with what does one equal what, that one[4] says “more-than-unequalled”? Mind and principle are both unspeakable; it is unspeakable yet spoken--speaking that this mind equals this principle, therefore it is called more-than-unequalled. The first is a horizontal explanation; the second is a vertical explanation; the third is neither horizontal nor vertical (and so forth).**

**此翻總持，總持惡不起、善不失(其一)。又翻能遮能持，能持善、能遮惡(其二。其三)此能遮邊惡、能持中善。(其四)眾經開遮不同，或專用治病，如那達居[5]士；或專護法，如此文；或專用滅罪，如方等；或通用治病滅罪護經，如《請觀音》，或大明呪無上明呪無等等明呪，則非治病、非滅罪、非護經，若通方者亦應兼，若論別者幸須依經勿乖教(云云)。諸師或說呪者，是鬼神王名，稱其王名，部落敬主不敢為非，故能降伏一切鬼魅(其一)。或云呪者如軍中之密號，唱號相應無所訶問，若不相應即執治罪，若不順呪者頭破七分，若順呪者則無過失(其二)。或云呪者，密默治惡惡自休息，譬如微賤，從此國逃彼國，訛稱王子，彼國以公主妻之，多瞋難事。有一明人從其國來，主往說之，其人語主，若當瞋時說偈，偈云「無親遊他國，欺誑一切人，麁食是常事，何勞復作瞋。」說是偈時默然瞋歇後不復瞋，是主及一切人但聞斯偈，皆不知意。呪亦如是，密默遮惡餘無識者(其三)。或云呪者，是諸佛密語，如王索先陀婆，一切群下無有能識，唯有智臣乃能知之。呪亦如是，秖是一法遍有諸力，病愈罪除善生道合(其四)。為此義故皆存本音，譯人不翻意在此也。惡世弘經喜多惱難，以呪護之使道流通也。**

**This is translated as dharani, “total retention”: total retention causes evil not to arise and good not to be lost (first). It is also translated as “able to ward and able to hold”: able to hold good and able to ward off evil (second and third). This means able to ward off evil on the margins and able to hold good in the middle (fourth). The sutras open and close these differently: some are used specifically to cure illness, such as the layman Nadā[5]; some are specifically to protect the Dharma, as in this text; some are specifically to eliminate sin, as in the Vaipulya; some are used generally to cure illness, eliminate sin, and protect the sutra, as in the *Supplication to Avalokiteśvara*. Or the great bright mantra, the unsurpassed bright mantra, the more-than-unequalled bright mantra are not for curing illness, not for eliminating sin, not for protecting the sutra; if one treats it generally, it should also include these; if one speaks specifically, one should rely on the sutra and not deviate from the teaching (and so forth). Some masters say that mantras are the names of kings of ghosts and spirits; by invoking the king’s name, the clan reveres its lord and does not dare do wrong, therefore all demons can be subdued (first). Others say that mantras are like secret signals in the army: if the signal matches, there is no interrogation; if it does not match, they arrest and punish. If one does not accord with the mantra, the head is split into seven parts; if one accords with the mantra, there is no fault (second). Others say that mantras are secretly and silently used to cure evil so that evil ceases by itself. For example, a lowly person fled from this country to another, falsely claiming to be a king’s son; the other country married him to the princess, and he became very angry and difficult. A wise man came from his country; the king went to consult him. The man said to the king: when he becomes angry, recite a verse--the verse says, “Without kin he roams another land, deceiving everyone; coarse food is a common matter, why labor again to be angry.” When this verse was spoken, he fell silent and his anger subsided, and afterward he was no longer angry. The king and all people only heard the verse, but did not know its meaning. Mantras are also like this: they secretly and silently ward off evil, with no one else understanding (third). Others say that mantras are the Buddhas’ secret language, like a king requesting saindhava; none of the officials can recognize it, only a wise minister can know it. Mantras are likewise: they are just one Dharma, pervading with various powers--illness is healed, sin is eliminated, good is produced, and the path accords (fourth). For this reason the original sounds are all preserved; translators do not translate, and the intent lies here. In evil ages, propagating the sutra often meets many troubles; mantras are used to protect it so that the Way circulates.**

**The text has four: (1) asking about the merits of upholding the sutra, (2) answering that they are very many, (3) requesting protection by mantra, (4) benefits from hearing the chapter. The first[6] asks, as in the text. The second answer has measurements: the question asks whether they are many; the answer says very many, measuring out the merits, as in the text. Requesting the mantra has five rounds: (1) Medicine King, (2) Brave Giving, (3) Vaiśravaṇa, (4) Upholding the Nation, (5) the ten daughters. Medicine King has four: (1) request, (2) recite, (3) praise, (4) seal. The following cases have three, as in the text. The ten daughters have five: (1) list names, (2) request recitation, (3) praise, (4) vow, (5) seal. “Yakṣa” translates as swift demon; “Rākṣasa” translates as man-eating demon. These two groups are under the north. “Pūtana” is a fever demon; “Kītā” is a corpse-raising demon; both humans and yakṣas can have this demon. “Vidāra” is a red demon; “Kandāra” a yellow demon (details unknown); “Umāle” a black demon (details unknown); “Aparāmāra” a blue demon. Branches of the ārī tree fall to the ground and, by their nature,[1] break into seven pieces. Killing parents and breaking the saṅgha are the three heinous offenses. As for foreign oils: they pound hemp, let insects arise, then crush them together, to obtain more juice and increase fat--this transgression is even worse. For scales and measures, taking out lightly and bringing in heavily is severe fraud and theft. In recent times there are small measures for taking out and big measures for bringing in; they even stamp inscriptions on the back of the measures. This offense is also not light.**

**此因緣出他經，昔佛末法有四比丘，於《法華經》極生殷重，雖卷舒祕教，甘露未[2]霑，日夜翹誠，晷刻無忘，歎云：「苟非其人乎？地非其處乎？」世間[3]紛愀，靜散相乖，直爾求閑尚須厭棄，況崇道乎？於是結契山林，志欣佛慧，幽居日積，衣糧單[4]罄，有待多煩，無時不乏，一餐喀喀，廢萬里之行，十旬九飯，屈雲霄之志，可得言哉？其一人云：「吾等四窮尚不存身，法當安寄？君三人者但以命奉道，莫慮朝中，我一人者捨此身力，誓給所須。」於是振錫門閭以求供繼，自春至冬周而復始，如僕奉大家，甘苦無喜慍。三人得展其誠，功圓事辦，一世之益，當無量生。其一人者數涉人間，[5]屢逢聲色，坯器未火，難可護持。偶逢王出車，馬駢[6]闐旌旗噏赫，生心動念愛彼光榮，功德薰修隨念受報，人中天上常得為王，福雖不貲亦有限也。三人得道會而議云：「我免籠樊功由此王，其耽果報增長有為，從此死已不復為王，方沈火坑良難可救，幸其未苦正可開化。」其一人云：「此王著欲而復邪見，若非愛鈎無由可拔，一人可為端正婦，二作聰明兒，兒婦之言必當從順，如宜設化果獲改邪。」婦者，妙音菩薩是；昔二子者，今藥王、藥上二菩薩是，昔時王者，今華德菩薩是。所以白毫東召，[7]升紫臺而西引，神呪護經，使流通而大益，說四聖之前緣故，名「妙莊嚴王本事品」。又「妙莊嚴」者，妙法功德莊嚴諸根也。此王往日於妙法有緣，道熏時熟，諸根應淨，生雖未獲，其理必臻，靈瑞感通，嘉名早立。例如善吉雖未無諍，已號空生，故下文云「得清淨功德莊嚴三昧」，以是義故名「妙莊嚴王」也。前品說呪護，今品說人護，人護尚爾，呪護彌良，普勸流通也。**

**This causal account comes from other sutras. In the final Dharma of a former Buddha there were four bhikṣus who deeply revered the *Lotus Sutra*. Though they unrolled and rolled up the secret teaching, the sweet dew had not yet[2] touched them; day and night they lifted sincere intent, not forgetting for even a moment. They lamented: “Is it that the person is not right? Is the ground not the right place?” The world is[3] in turmoil; stillness and distraction conflict. To seek quiet directly already requires casting off aversion; how much more to revere the Way? Therefore they formed a pact in the mountains and forests, aspiring to Buddha-wisdom. Their secluded dwelling accumulated by the day; clothing and food were single and depleted[4]; much irritation with needing to wait, never without lack. One meal was meager, preventing a thousand-mile journey; in ten ten-day periods there were nine meals. Their aspiration to the clouds was bent--how can it be spoken? One of them said, “We four are poor; we cannot even preserve our bodies--how can the Dharma be secured? You three only offer your lives to the Way; do not worry about the court. I alone will give up this bodily strength and vow to supply what is needed.” Thereupon he shook his staff and went to the gate to seek offerings and support, from spring to winter circling and beginning again, like a servant attending a great household, taking bitterness and sweetness without joy or resentment. The three were able to extend their sincerity; their work was complete and the matter accomplished. The benefit of one life should extend to immeasurable lives. The one person often went among people and[5] repeatedly encountered sights and sounds; as an unfired vessel, he was hard to protect. By chance he encountered the king’s carriage going out; horses were aligned and[6] filled, banners and flags were blazing and brilliant. He gave rise to thoughts and loved that glory; merits and cultivation perfumed him so that he received retribution in accord with his thoughts, becoming a king among humans and in heavens. Though his blessings were not to be scoffed at, they were limited. The three attained the path, gathered, and discussed: “Our escape from the cage and thicket is due to this king. He clings to the fruit and increases the conditioned; after this death he will not again be king, and he will then sink into the fire pit and be hard to save. Fortunately he has not yet suffered; it is just the time to transform him.” One of them said, “This king is attached to desire and also holds wrong views. Unless we use a hook of love, there is no way to pull him out. One of us can become his upright wife; two can become his intelligent sons. The words of sons and wife he will certainly follow. We should set the transformation accordingly and he will change his wrong views.” The wife is the bodhisattva Wonderful Sound; the two sons then are now the two bodhisattvas Medicine King and Medicine Superior; the king at that time is now the bodhisattva Huade. Therefore the white ūrṇā summons from the east,[7] ascending the purple dais and drawing from the west; the divine mantras protect the sutra, enabling circulation and great benefit. Because it explains the past causes of the four sages, it is called the “Past Deeds of King Wonderful Adornment” chapter. Moreover, “Wonderful Adornment” means the merits of the wondrous Dharma adorn the roots. This king in former days had affinity with the wondrous Dharma; when the perfuming of the Way matured, the roots should be pure. Though he had not yet obtained it in that life, the principle would necessarily reach it; spiritual auspices and responsive penetration arose, and the fine name was established early. For example, though Sudatta had not yet attained non-contention, he was already called “Born of Emptiness.” Therefore the text below says, “he attained the samadhi adorned by pure merits.” For this reason he is named “King Wonderful Adornment.” The previous chapter spoke of mantra protection; this chapter speaks of human protection. If human protection is thus, mantra protection is even better; it universally exhorts circulation.**

**From “within that Buddha’s Dharma” down, [8] second, it doubly marks the transformer and the transformed. The one transformed and the three transformers are all named, separately manifesting the two sons’ blessings and wisdom, the six perfections, and the four vast vows. Other sutras take this as the ten pāramitās, a horizontal Dharma-gate; the thirty-seven aids to the path are a vertical Dharma-gate. In other sutras it is the right path, and each practice is an aid to the path. In this sutra the ten perfections are taken as the right, and these are called the aids to the path. The perfection of dhyana includes samadhi; each step in the path factors has samadhi. Further, naming seven samadhis is to widely reveal the Dharma-gates.**

**From “at that time that Buddha” down, third, the transforming skillful means, the text has three: (1) the time arrives, (2) discussion, (3) manifesting transformation. The time arriving: that Buddha appears in the world, always proclaiming the true Dharma; when the king’s affinity is weak it is not the right time, but if the *Lotus Sutra* is preached, then it is the right time. The text says, “That Buddha was about to[9] guide and preach the *Lotus Sutra*,” which is its meaning. Second, discussion: in the text the sons tell the mother that the time has arrived; the mother yields and tells them to transform the father; the sons resent being in the house of wrong views; the mother reproaches them and makes them worry--all as in the text. From “thereupon the two sons” down is the third: manifesting transformation. The manifestations should be eighteen transformations and can be explained in detail. From “when the father saw the sons” down, [10] fourth, the transformed obtains benefit. The text has ten: (1) trusting the sons and submitting to the teacher. The king sees wrong transformations--one or two, narrow and crude; seeing what his sons do, he exclaims that it is unprecedented. Trusting his sons, he submits to their teacher and asks who the teacher is, saying he too wishes to see him. (2) Once the father-king believes, the palace’s eighty-four thousand are also matured; they tell the mother and rejoice, wishing to allow departure into the homeless life, and the mother also permits it. (3) They again urge their parents: now is the time, and the Buddha is hard to meet. (4) The work of transformation is already manifest; the Buddha praises the merits. “Lotus Samadhi” gathers all dharmas and returns them to the one real suchness, as explained above. “Leaving evil destinies”: in one pass the three bad paths are called evil destinies; in a full discussion, the twenty-five existences all oppose the true and arise from delusion and are all evil destinies. Now all are left; this is the twenty-five samadhis, breaking the twenty-five existences. “Buddha-assembly samadhi” means the Buddhas gather in the secret treasury; it is only the Buddhas’ practice-place, not that of others. (5) Together they go to the Buddha’s place, hear the Dharma and make offerings, see auspicious signs and rejoice. (6) The Buddha gives them predictions. (7) They leave home and practice. (8) He praises the two sons. (9) The Buddha recounts the height of their practice. (10) He praises the Buddha’s own vows. The Buddha praises good spiritual friends as having great meaning; good spiritual friends can accomplish Buddha work--this is external-protection good spiritual friends. “Instruct, teach, benefit, and gladden” are good spiritual friends of teaching. “That is, transforming and guiding so that they can see the Buddha” are good spiritual friends as fellow-travelers. “Causing entry into bodhi” are good spiritual friends of ultimate reality and real suchness. The *Saṃyukta Āgama* says, “Good spiritual friends are like a virtuous wife,” which is the meaning of external protection; further, good spiritual friends[11] are like relatives and wealth, which is the meaning of fellow-travelers; further, good spiritual friends are like a merchant guide, which is the meaning of teaching; further, good spiritual friends are like a child lying in the father’s arms, which is the meaning of ultimate reality[12].**

**釋普賢菩薩勸發品**

**Explanation of the "Samantabhadra Bodhisattva’s Exhortation" Chapter**

**《大論》、《觀經》同名遍吉，此經稱「普賢」，皆漢語，梵音邲輸颰陀，此云普賢。《悲華》云「我誓於穢惡世界，行菩薩道使得嚴淨，我行要當勝諸菩薩。寶藏佛言：『以是因緣今改汝字名為普賢。』」此即三悉檀意，復是因緣解釋，又是行願得名。由來從於念處至四善根，通稱為[1]普賢。別約世第一法隣真近聖，稱之為賢，此三藏中說耳。今明伏道之頂，其因周遍曰「普」，斷道之後隣于極聖曰「賢」。若十信是伏道之始，非頂、非周，隣[2]于初聖之初，非後、非極，乃至第十地亦非周極，況前諸位乎？今論等覺之位，居眾伏之頂，伏道周遍故名為「普」，斷道纔盡所較無幾，隣終際極故名為「賢」，《釋論》引十四夜月如十五夜月，斯義明矣。此約圓教位，釋後位普賢也。「勸發」者，戀法之辭也，遙在彼國具聞此經始末既周，欲令自行化他永永無已，故自東自西而來勸發，具四悉檀意(云云)。文云「我為供養《法華經》故自現其身，若見我身甚大歡喜(其一)；[3]已見我故轉復精進，即得三昧及陀羅尼(其二)；得是陀羅尼故，無有非人能破壞者，亦復不為女人之所惑亂(其三)；三千大千世界微塵菩薩具普賢道(其四)。」如此明文即四悉檀，而來勸發也。上判流通為三：從十九行偈已後[4]三品半，舉經力大以勸流通；〈藥王品〉下五品，舉菩薩化道力大以勸流通；此一品舉普賢誓願力大以勸流通。**

**The *Great Treatise* and the *Contemplation Sutra* both name him “Universal Auspice”; this sutra calls him “Universal Virtue.” Both are Chinese; the Sanskrit is Bìshūpátuó, which means Universal Virtue. The *Sutra of Compassionate Flower* says, “I vow in defiled and evil worlds to practice the bodhisattva path and make them pure and adorned; my practice should surpass all bodhisattvas.” The Buddha Treasure-Store said, “Because of this cause and condition, I now change your name to Universal Virtue.” This is the intent of the Three Siddhantas; it is also an explanation by causes and conditions, and a naming by vows in practice. From the four mindfulness foundations up to the four good roots, it is generally called[1] Samantabhadra. Separately, with reference to the worldly first Dharma, being near the true and near the sage, he is called “virtuous”; this is only spoken in the Tripiṭaka. Now we clarify the summit of the path of subduing: its cause is pervasive, called “universal”; after the path of severing, being near the utmost sage, it is called “virtuous.” If the ten faiths are the beginning of the path of subduing, they are neither summit nor pervasive; they are near[2] the beginning of the first sage, neither later nor ultimate. Even the tenth ground is not pervasive and ultimate--how much more the previous stages? Now discussing the stage of equal enlightenment: it resides at the summit of all subduing; because the path of subduing is pervasive it is called “universal”; because the path of severing is almost complete and is near the final ultimate, it is called “virtuous.” The *Treatise* cites the fourteenth-night moon as like the fifteenth-night moon, making this meaning clear. This explains the later-stage Samantabhadra in terms of the Perfect teaching. “Exhortation” is the language of longing for the Dharma. From afar in that land, having heard this sutra from beginning to end, he wishes to cause self-practice and transforming others to continue without end; therefore he comes from east and west to exhort, embodying the Four Siddhantas (and so forth). The text says, “I, in order to make offerings to the *Lotus Sutra*, manifest my body; if one sees my body, one greatly rejoices (first);[3] having seen me, one becomes even more diligent and immediately attains samadhi and dharani (second); because one attains this dharani, no non-human can damage one, and one is not confused by women (third); bodhisattvas as numerous as the motes of dust in the three-thousand great-thousand world possess the Samantabhadra path (fourth).” These explicit words are the Four Siddhantas, and he comes to exhort. Above, circulation is divided into three: after the nineteen-line verse, there are[4] three and a half chapters, raising the great power of the sutra to exhort circulation; from the “Medicine King” chapter down five chapters, raising the great power of the bodhisattvas’ transformative path to exhort circulation; this one chapter raises the great power of Samantabhadra’s vows to exhort circulation.**

**分文為四：一、發來；二、勸發；三、述發；四、發益。初經家敘發來，為三：一、上供；二、下化；三、修敬。「自在」者理一也，「神通」者行一也，「威德」者人一也，「名聞」者教一也。又「自在」者常也，「神通」者樂也，「威德」者我也，「名聞」者淨也，言說如此，即一而四，德無不備，自在義焉。淨力故雨花，樂力故奏伎，神通故動地。自在力故隨意而雨，隨去隨雨，隨動隨奏。譬如大龍飛行不息，身邊雲雨流起無窮。普賢及眷屬，以菩薩身、用四德力來。勸發四：一、[5]所逕[6]歷處自行上供，其事如此。從「又與諸天龍」下，所[7]逕歷處下化利益，隨他所宜現八部像，略用二力隨所堪任，其事如此。三者、修敬，身旋面禮，如文。**

**The text is divided into four: (1) coming forth, (2) exhorting, (3) describing the exhortation, (4) issuing benefits. First, the sutra-compilers narrate his coming, in three: (1) offerings above, (2) transforming below, (3) cultivating reverence. “Self-mastery” is the unity of principle; “spiritual powers” are the unity of practice; “majesty and virtue” are the unity of person; “fame” is the unity of teaching. Further, “self-mastery” is permanence, “spiritual powers” are bliss, “majesty and virtue” are self, and “fame” is purity. Spoken thus, the one is four; no virtue is lacking--this is the meaning of self-mastery. Because of the power of purity, flowers rain; because of the power of bliss, music plays; because of spiritual powers, the earth moves. Because of the power of self-mastery, it rains according to intent, and rains as he goes; music plays as he moves. It is like a great dragon flying without ceasing, with clouds and rain streaming endlessly around it. Samantabhadra and his retinue come with bodhisattva bodies, using the power of the four virtues. Exhorting has four: first, in the places[5] he travels[6], he makes offerings above himself; the matter is thus. From “also with devas and nāgas” down, in the places[7] he travels, he transforms below and benefits; according to what is suitable for others he manifests the forms of the eight divisions. Using two powers in brief, according to what they can bear, the matter is thus. Third, cultivating reverence: he turns his body and bows, as in the text.**

**勸發為二：一、請問勸發；二、誓願勸[8]發。有問、有答。問者，遙聞經竟，戀法無已，遠來之志，志在勸發，是故更請。正說勸發自行，更請流通勸發化他，如來若許，二途再演光光無極，是故雙請也。佛答，先總、次別、三結。別列四法名，如文。其既雙請，如來巧答，略舉四以蔽諸。何者？四法之要該括正、通。何者？佛雖無偏，若能遠惡從善，[9]反迷還正，開權知見，顯佛知見者，則稱可聖心，諸佛護念；若佛知見開，則般若照明，是植眾德本；亦是入正定聚，不亂、不味，不取、不捨；亦是發救眾生。當知此四與開權顯實，名異體同，無二無別。又「佛護念」者，是開佛知見；「植眾德本」是示佛知見；「發救眾生」是悟佛知見；「入正定聚」是入佛知見。迹門之要，此四收矣。又迹則有本，從本開示悟入，故有迹中開示悟入。今開迹即顯本，本迹無二無別，以四法答其請正，於義明矣。**

**Exhortation has two: (1) asking and requesting exhortation, (2) exhortation by vow.[8] There is question and answer. The questioner hears from afar that the sutra has been completed; his longing for the Dharma has no end, and his intention in coming from afar is to exhort, therefore he asks again. The main exposition exhorts self-practice; he further requests circulation to exhort transforming others. If the Tathāgata permits, the two paths will be re-proclaimed again and again without end; therefore he asks both. The Buddha answers: first generally, next specifically, third with a conclusion. Specifically he lists the names of the four dharmas, as in the text. Since he asked both, the Tathāgata answers skillfully, briefly raising four to cover all. Why? The essentials of the four dharmas encompass both the main and the circulation. Why? Though the Buddha is impartial, if one can keep far from evil and follow good,[9] turn from delusion and return to the correct, open the provisional knowledge and reveal the Buddha’s knowledge, then one accords with the holy mind and the Buddhas protect and remember them. If the Buddha’s knowledge is opened, prajna illuminates--this is planting the root of all virtues. It is also entering the assembly of right concentration, not confused, not savoring, not grasping, not rejecting. It is also arousing the resolve to save beings. You should know these four and the opening of the provisional and revealing of the real are different in name but the same in substance, neither two nor different. Further, “the Buddha’s protection and remembrance” is opening the Buddha’s knowledge and vision; “planting the root of all virtues” is showing the Buddha’s knowledge and vision; “arousing the resolve to save beings” is awakening to the Buddha’s knowledge and vision; “entering the assembly of right concentration” is entering the Buddha’s knowledge and vision. The essentials of the Trace Gate are gathered by these four. Further, traces have a root; opening, showing, awakening, and entering from the root, therefore there are opening, showing, awakening, and entering within the trace. Now opening the trace is precisely revealing the root; root and trace are neither two nor different. Using the four dharmas to answer his request about the main exposition makes the meaning clear.**

**以四法答請流通，流通之方，唯三唯四，「發救眾生」是入如來室；「入正定聚、佛所護念」是著如來衣；「植眾德本」是坐如來座。是弘宣之要，即四而三。「發救眾生」是誓願安樂行；「入正定聚」是意安樂行；「植眾德本」是口安樂行；「護念」是身安樂行，當知後四即前四也。一答酬其兩請，舉四冠罩一經，《法華》之重演，斯經之再宣，遠來之勸發，其義如此。**

**Using the four dharmas to answer the request for circulation: the method of circulation is only three and only four. “Arousing the resolve to save beings” is entering the Tathāgata’s room; “entering the assembly of right concentration” and “the Buddha’s protection and remembrance” are wearing the Tathāgata’s robe; “planting the root of all virtues” is sitting on the Tathāgata’s seat. These are the essentials of promulgation, four that are three. “Arousing the resolve to save beings” is peaceful practice of vows; “entering the assembly of right concentration” is peaceful practice of mind; “planting the root of all virtues” is peaceful practice of speech; “protection and remembrance” is peaceful practice of body. You should know the latter four are precisely the former four. One answer repays his two requests; raising the four, he crowns and covers the whole sutra. The re-proclamation of the *Lotus Sutra*, the re-expounding of this sutra, the exhortation from afar--its meaning is thus.**

**三、結者，於如來滅後必得是經。舊云：「能行四法於未來世，常手得是經。」今謂不爾，上文云「諸法實相義，已為汝等說」，又云「咸令眾生開示悟入佛之知見」。蓋《法華》之正體，能行四法必得此解，名[11]解為經，此結其請正之問，若能運此解，行傳與他人，他人得斯信解成初依人，能得真解成第二、第三、第四依人，此結其請流通之問，此意不見，浪作餘說耶？**

**Third, the conclusion: after the Tathāgata’s extinction one must obtain this sutra. The old saying is, “Those who can practice the four dharmas in future ages will always have this sutra at hand.” Now I say this is not so. Above the text says, “The meaning of the real suchness of all dharmas has already been spoken for you,” and it also says, “all are caused to open, reveal, awaken, and enter the Buddha’s knowledge and vision.” The true body of the *Lotus Sutra* is this: those who can practice the four dharmas must obtain this understanding; calling the understanding[11] the sutra, this concludes his question requesting the main exposition. If one can apply this understanding and practice transmitting it to others, others obtain this faith-and-understanding and become the first reliance; those who can obtain true understanding become the second, third, and fourth reliance. This concludes his question requesting circulation. If one does not see this meaning, why make other explanations in vain?**

**「白佛」下，第二，誓願勸發。文為二：一、護人，二、護法。護人為六：一、攘其外難，初、總攘其難，故言「使無伺求得其便」者是也。次、別攘其難，舉十二非是也。二、教其內法，凡三番教訓，初、行立讀誦，乘六牙白象安慰其心；次、坐思惟，復乘六牙教示其經，與其三昧[12]也。「陀羅尼」旋假入空也，「百千旋」者，旋空出假也，「方便」者，二為方便道，得入中道第一義諦也。後、三七一心精進，復乘六牙示教利喜說呪，如文。三、覆以神力，若聞、若持莫非神力，如文。四、示勝因，若能五種法師，即三世佛所為種，為熟為脫，此人同未來諸佛得脫，故言「同普賢行」。此人已於先佛[＊10-3]植善，故言「深種善根」。此人為現佛所熟，故言「手摩其頭」。五、示近果，但能書寫近在忉利，具五法師次在兜率，如文。六、總結，「是故智者」下是也。**

**From “he addressed the Buddha” down is the second: exhortation by vow. The text has two: (1) protecting people, (2) protecting the Dharma. Protecting people has six: first, warding off external difficulties. First, the general warding off of difficulties: therefore it says, “so that there are no spies who can find their convenience.” Next, specific warding off of difficulties: it raises twelve “not so.” Second, teaching the internal Dharma: there are three rounds of instruction. First, walking and standing, reading and reciting, riding a six-tusked white elephant to comfort their minds. Second, sitting in contemplation, again riding the six-tusked [elephant] to teach and show the sutra and give its samadhi.[12] “dharani” is turning from the provisional and entering emptiness; “hundred-thousand rotations” are turning from emptiness and exiting the provisional; “expedients” are the two as the expedient path, enabling entry into the middle way’s First Principle. Afterward, three times seven, with one mind in diligence, again riding the six-tusked [elephant] to teach, benefit, gladden, and speak the mantra, as in the text. Third, covering with spiritual power: whether hearing or upholding, none is not spiritual power, as in the text. Fourth, showing the superior cause: if one can be the five kinds of Dharma teachers, then one is a seed, a maturation, and a liberation for the Buddhas of the three times; such a person will be liberated together with future Buddhas, therefore it is said “together with Samantabhadra’s practice.” This person has already planted good with the former Buddhas,[＊10-3] therefore it is said “deeply planted good roots.” This person is matured by the present Buddha, therefore it says “he touches his crown.” Fifth, showing the near fruit: if one can only write it, one will soon be in Trāyastriṃśa; if one fully has the five Dharma teachers, next one will be in Tuṣita, as in the text. Sixth, the general conclusion is from “therefore the wise” down.**

**第三、述發者，即是如來舉勝述成其劣，增進行者勇銳弘宣。先述護法，云汝能如是外多利益，內積慈悲，又久劫[＊3-1]已來作如此護，我亦以佛之神力守護是法，況復汝耶？如文。從「若有[1]人」下，述其護人，雖不次第，述成意足。「當知是人則見釋迦牟尼佛」者，述其示身教法，[2]其尚見我萬德果身，況汝因中六牙白象？其尚從佛口具足聞經，況汝所教忘失章句？其尚為佛口讚、手摩、佛衣所覆，況汝因人陀羅尼覆耶？從「不貪著世樂」下，述其舉因。廣舉因中無諸過惡，少欲知足修普賢行，述勝因也。從「若如來滅後」下，述其舉近果也。其人當詣道場[3]必成遠果，況近果耶？亦於現世得其近果，不但生天也。從「若人輕毀」下，述其能攘外難。佛廣示毀者之罪，令知過必改不相惱亂，非但持經者難滅，亦乃欲毀者福生，無毀、無難彼此安樂，曠濟無偏，慈之至也。從「應起遠迎當如敬[4]佛」述其結信者功德。**

**Third, describing the exhortation: this is the Tathāgata raising the superior and describing to complete the inferior, increasing the practitioner’s courage and sharpness in propagating. First he describes the protection of the Dharma, saying that you can thus bring many external benefits and internally accumulate compassion, and for many kalpas[＊3-1] you have protected in this way; I also, by the Buddha’s spiritual power, protect this Dharma--how much more you? As in the text. From “if there is a[1] person” down, he describes the protection of persons. Though not in sequence, the description is sufficient in meaning. “You should know that this person will see Śākyamuni Buddha” describes his manifesting the body and teaching the Dharma.[2] If he can even see my fruit-body of ten-thousand virtues, how much more your six-tusked white elephant in the causal stage? If he can even hear the sutra fully from the Buddha’s mouth, how much more will he forget the lines and phrases of what you teach? If he can even be praised by the Buddha’s mouth, touched by the Buddha’s hand, and covered by the Buddha’s robe, how much more will he be covered by your human dharani? From “not greedy for worldly pleasures” down, he describes the raising of causes. He broadly raises the causes as having no faults or evils, few desires and contentment, cultivating the Samantabhadra practice--this describes superior causes. From “if after the Tathāgata’s extinction” down, he describes the raising of near fruits. Such a person should go to the bodhi seat and[3] certainly accomplish the distant fruit; how much more the near fruit? He also obtains the near fruit in the present life, not only rebirth in heaven. From “if a person lightly slanders” down, he describes his ability to ward off external difficulties. The Buddha broadly shows the offenses of those who slander, causing them to know their faults and thus reform without troubling each other. It is not only that the difficulties of those who uphold the sutra are eliminated; those who would slander also generate blessings. With no slander and no difficulties, both parties are at ease; vast benefit without partiality--this is compassion at its utmost. From “one should rise and go far to welcome them as one would revere the[4] Buddha” he describes the concluding merits of the believers.**

**第四、從「說是」下，發益之文也。一、聞品益，「[5]旋陀羅尼」是初地位，「具普賢道」是十地位；二、聞經益，「大眾歡喜」是也。「歡喜」如前說。此中云何猶稱聲聞？乃是經家存其本位耳。又經家稱其是大乘聲聞，以佛道聲令一切聞，斯義彌顯也。**

**Fourth, from “when this was said” down is the text of issuing benefits. First, benefits of hearing the chapter: “[5]Rotational dharani” is the first-ground stage; “fully possessing the Samantabhadra path” is the tenth-ground stage. Second, benefits of hearing the sutra: “the great assembly rejoiced” is this. “Rejoicing” is as explained above. Why are they still called śrāvakas here? This is simply the sutra-compilers preserving their original status. Moreover, the sutra-compilers call them Mahayana śrāvakas, making all hear the sound of the Buddha-way; this meaning is even more manifest.**
