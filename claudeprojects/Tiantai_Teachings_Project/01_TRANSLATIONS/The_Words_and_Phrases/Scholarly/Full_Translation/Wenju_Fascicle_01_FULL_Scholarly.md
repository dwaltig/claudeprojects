### Section 1: The Nature of Ultimate Truth and the Lotus Sutra

**敘曰：至理無名，名流四天之下；真乘不動，動出三界之中。**

**Exposition: Ultimate principle has no name, yet names circulate beneath the Four Celestial Kings. The true vehicle does not move, yet movement emerges from within the Three Realms.**

---

**證教即事而凝然，悉檀隨緣而化物，無謀汲引，功莫大哉！**

**Realization and teaching are intrinsically still even while manifesting as events; the four siddhāntas[^1] respond to conditions to transform beings. Without contrivance they draw beings upward—their merit is immeasurable!**

[^1]: **Siddhānta** (Sanskrit: सिद्धान्त, *siddhānta*; Chinese: 悉檀, *xītán*) — The four modes of Buddhist teaching identified by Master Zhiyi: (1) Mundane siddhānta (worldly truths accessible to ordinary understanding), (2) Individual siddhānta (teachings calibrated to personal capacity), (3) Therapeutic siddhānta (antidotes to specific delusions), (4) Ultimate siddhānta (supreme reality itself).

---

**《妙法蓮華經》者，洎仁雄出世，為一大事因緣之所說之也。**

**The *Saddharma-puṇḍarīka-sūtra* (Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower Sutra) was expounded when the Compassionate Hero[^2] appeared in the world, for the sake of the "one great matter"—the causal condition [of revealing Buddha-nature].**

[^2]: **Compassionate Hero** (仁雄, *rénxióng*) — Epithet for Śākyamuni Buddha, combining compassion (仁) with heroic power (雄).

---

**但藥木不同，受潤成異；機宜匪一，稟教亦差。**

**Yet medicinal herbs and trees are not identical, so receiving the same moisture they develop differently. The capacities of beings are not uniform, so receiving teachings they likewise differ in attainment.**

---

**其施權也，則鹿苑四諦之法輪；其顯實也，則鷲峯三變之淨土。**

**When [the Buddha] deployed provisional means (權, *quán*), there was the Dharma Wheel of the Four Noble Truths at Deer Park. When he revealed the ultimate truth (實, *shí*), there was the Pure Land of the Three Transformations[^3] at Vulture Peak.**

[^3]: **Three Transformations** (三變, *sānbiàn*) — The three purifications of the assembly ground described in the Lotus Sutra, Chapter 11 ("Seeing the Jeweled Stūpa"), where Śākyamuni purifies the Sahā world three times to reveal the cosmic assembly.

---

**旨深詞寘，人尊道高，彰壽量之遠本，會伽耶之近迹。**

**Its purport is profound, its words concentrated; the Person is revered, the Way lofty. It manifests the distant fundamental ground (遠本, *yuǎnběn*) of [Buddha's] lifespan,[^4] gathering together the recent traces (近迹, *jìnjì*)[^5] of [the Buddha's manifestation at] Gayā.**

[^4]: **Distant fundamental ground of lifespan** — Reference to the "Lifespan of the Tathāgata" chapter (Chapter 16), revealing Śākyamuni's enlightenment in the inconceivably distant past (久遠實成, *jiǔyuǎn shíchéng*).

[^5]: **Recent traces** — The historical manifestation of the Buddha in 6th century BCE India, born at Kapilavastu, enlightened at Bodhgayā. Tiantai doctrine distinguishes "Trace Gate" (迹門, *jìmén*) from "Fundamental Gate" (本門, *běnmén*).

---

**雨吹擊演，廢昔說之筌蹄；開示悟入，獲今家之魚兔。**

**The rain [of Dharma],[^6] the blowing wind, striking, and proclaiming—these abandon the previous rafts and snares.[^7] Through opening, showing, awakening, and entering,[^8] one captures the fish and rabbit[^9] of the present dispensation.**

[^6]: **Rain of Dharma** — Allusion to the "Medicinal Herbs" chapter (Chapter 5), where Dharma is compared to rain falling equally on all plants.

[^7]: **Rafts and snares** (筌蹄, *quántí*) — Classical Chinese image from Zhuangzi: the fish trap (筌) and rabbit snare (蹄) are forgotten once the fish/rabbit is caught. Here: provisional teachings are discarded once ultimate truth is realized.

[^8]: **Opening, showing, awakening, entering** (開示悟入, *kāi shì wù rù*) — The four stages of Buddha-knowledge described in the "Skillful Means" chapter (Chapter 2): the Buddha opens (開) the wisdom-vision, shows (示) it, causes awakening (悟) to it, and enables entry (入) into it.

[^9]: **Fish and rabbit** — The true goal concealed within provisional teachings, now directly obtained.

---

**微塵菩薩，增道損生；草庵聲聞，恥小欣大。**

**The bodhisattvas [numerous as] dust motes[^10] increase the Way and diminish rebirth. The śrāvakas in their grass huts feel shame for the Lesser [Vehicle] and aspire to the Great.**

[^10]: **Bodhisattvas numerous as dust motes** — Reference to the Bodhisattvas of the Earth who emerge from underground in Chapter 15 ("Emerging from the Earth"), described as numerous as the dust particles of a thousand worlds.

---

**藥王燒臂而供養，多寶全身以證明，圓極冲微，不可得而言也。**

**Medicine King Bodhisattva burned his arm as an offering;[^11] Prabhūtaratna [Tathāgata] appeared with his entire body to bear witness.[^12] The perfect ultimate is subtle and profound—it cannot be expressed in words.**

[^11]: **Medicine King burning his arm** — Recounted in Chapter 23 ("Former Affairs of Medicine King Bodhisattva"), where in a past life he burns his arms for 72,000 years as an offering to the Buddha.

[^12]: **Prabhūtaratna's entire body** — The ancient Buddha Prabhūtaratna (多寶, *Duōbǎo*; "Many Treasures") who appears in his jeweled stūpa in Chapter 11 to authenticate the Lotus teaching, his body uncorrupted.

### Section 2: Biography of Master Zhiyi

**有天台大師，法號智顗，昔於如來前親聽茲典，位居五品；**

**There was the Great Master of Tiantai, whose Dharma-name was Zhiyi. In a former age he personally heard this scripture in the presence of the Tathāgata, dwelling at the rank of the Five Grades [of Disciples].[^13]**

[^13]: **Five Grades of Disciples** (五品, *wǔpǐn*) — From the "Distinctions in Benefits" chapter (Chapter 17): (1) joy on first hearing, (2) reading and reciting, (3) expounding to others, (4) concurrent practice of the six pāramitās, (5) proper practice of the six pāramitās. These are initial stages of practice before the "Ten Abodes" of the Bodhisattva path.

---

**聲振兩朝不歷講肆，佛乘懸解。**

**His reputation resounded through two dynasties [Chen and Sui]. Without having attended formal lecture halls, he spontaneously comprehended the Buddha Vehicle.**

---

**陀羅尼力樂說不窮，常於陳主大極殿，對御講《仁王般若經》，萬乘屈膝，百官彈指。**

**Through the power of dhāraṇī[^14] his joyful exposition was inexhaustible. He regularly lectured on the *Renwang Banruo Jing* (Prajñā Sutra for Benevolent Kings) in the Taiji Hall before Emperor [Chen] Xuan; the ten-thousand-chariot sovereign bent his knee, the hundred officials snapped their fingers [in approval].**

[^14]: **Dhāraṇī** (Sanskrit: धारणी, *dhāraṇī*; Chinese: 陀羅尼, *tuóluóní*) — Literally "retention"; mystical formulas or mantras that "retain" the essence of teachings, preventing their loss.

---

**且如觀心釋，妙離有無，取真性作軌，藉資照成徹。**

**Moreover, his "contemplation of mind" exegesis[^15] is wondrously free from [the extremes of] existence and non-existence. He takes true nature as the norm, relying on capital illumination to achieve penetration.**

[^15]: **Contemplation of mind exegesis** (觀心釋, *guānxīn shì*) — Zhiyi's distinctive hermeneutical method: interpreting scriptural passages as instructions for meditative introspection rather than merely doctrinal propositions.

---

**敘名詮宗，異於古德，五義覈理，皆扶聖教。**

**His explanation of the name and discernment of the principle differ from ancient worthies. The Five Profound Meanings[^16] rigorously investigate principle, all supporting the sagely teaching.**

[^16]: **Five Profound Meanings** (五義, *wǔyì*) — The structural framework of Zhiyi's *Fahua Xuanyi* (The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra): (1) Name, (2) Essence/Substance, (3) Main Principle, (4) Function, (5) [Position in the] Teachings. This is Tiantai's signature hermeneutical model.

---

**自智者弘法三十餘年，獨有《維摩疏》，隋朝奉煬帝勅，撰此之玄文，迺是灌頂法師私記，合二十卷，非智不彈，斯言允矣。**

**The Wise One [Zhiyi] propagated the Dharma for over thirty years; only a commentary on the *Vimalakīrti[-nirdeśa Sūtra]* existed. In the Sui dynasty, following Emperor Yang's imperial command, he composed this Profound Meaning (*Xuanyi*), which was privately recorded by Dharma Master Guanding and compiled into twenty fascicles. [As the saying goes,] "Without wisdom, do not pluck [the strings]"—this statement is truly reliable.**

---

### Section 3: The Editorial History (Master Langren's Reorganization)

**及其滅後一百餘載，至唐天寶中歲在戊子，有東陽郡清泰寺朗和尚，**

**Over one hundred years after [Zhiyi's] passing, in the Tianbao era of the Tang [dynasty], in the year *wuzi* (748 CE), there was Venerable Langren of Qingtai Temple in Dongyang Prefecture.**

---

**法門之眉壽、涼池之目足，乘戒俱急、內外兼包，獲滿慈之寶器、坐空生之石室，**

**[He was] the longevity of the Dharma Gate, the eyes and feet of the cooling pond.[^17] Urgent in both Vehicle and Vinaya, encompassing both inner [realization] and outer [learning], he obtained the precious vessel of Pūrṇa[^18] and sat in the stone chamber of Subhūti.[^19]**

[^17]: **Cooling pond** (涼池, *liángchí*) — Metaphor for the Dharma as refuge from saṃsāra's heat.

[^18]: **Pūrṇa** (Sanskrit: पूर्ण, *Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇīputra*; Chinese: 滿慈, *Mǎncí*) — Foremost disciple in expounding Dharma; receiver of prophecy in Lotus Chapter 8.

[^19]: **Subhūti** (Sanskrit: सुभूति, *Subhūti*; Chinese: 空生, *Kōngshēng*, "Born of Emptiness") — Foremost disciple in understanding emptiness; prominent in Prajñāpāramitā literature.

---

**必於講授之次默然歎曰：「觀其義趣，深契佛乘，尋其文勢，時有不次。**

**During the course of his lectures he silently sighed and said: "Observing the doctrinal purport, it profoundly accords with the Buddha Vehicle. Yet examining the textual structure, there are occasions when [sections are] out of sequence.**

---

**或文續義斷，或文後義前，或長行前開其章，或從後直述其義，或偈中先舉其數，或後不次其名。**

**Sometimes the text continues but the meaning breaks off; sometimes the text follows but the meaning precedes. Sometimes prose passages open a chapter at the beginning, while [their] meaning is directly explained afterward. Sometimes verses first enumerate categories, yet afterward the names are not listed in [corresponding] order.**

---

**然聖意難測，但仰信而已。」**

**However, the sagely intention is difficult to fathom—one can only look up [in reverence] and have faith."**

---

**今因諸聽徒頻勸請曰：「上根易悟，探賾不迷；中下之流，尋文失旨。儻更垂次比此，則弘益巨多。」**

**Now, because various students repeatedly urged him, saying: "Those of superior faculties easily awaken and in probing the profound are not confused. But those of middling and inferior capacity, in following the text, lose the essential meaning. If you were to arrange this in proper sequence, the benefits of propagation would be immense."**

---

**和上再三籌量，事不獲已，乃專念大師，求加可否。**

**The Venerable deliberated repeatedly; the matter could not be avoided. He concentrated his mindfulness on the Great Master [Zhiyi], seeking confirmation or denial.**

---

**因夢所感，方始條倫。**

**Through what was revealed in a dream,[^20] only then did he begin establishing [proper] sequence and order.**

[^20]: **Dream revelation** — A traditional method of seeking authorization from a deceased master; implies spiritual continuity and non-usurpation of authority.

---

**蓋亦隨情便宜誠諒，非苟求同異輒有增減於其間矣。**

**This was truly done following emotional appropriateness and sincerity; it was not a matter of arbitrarily seeking agreement or difference, nor of adding or subtracting [content] therein.**

---

**冀後諸學者，曉其元意，尋領索裳，擔金棄礫，說真實法，非虛妄人。**

**We hope that later students will understand the original intention—receiving the collar and grasping the robe,[^21] carrying gold and discarding gravel—expounding the true and real Dharma, not as deluded persons.**

[^21]: **Receiving the collar, grasping the robe** (尋領索裳, *xúnlǐng suǒcháng*) — Classical idiom: when you lift the collar, the whole garment follows. Metaphor for grasping the essential point that illuminates everything else.

---

**助玄風之廣扇，備丹丘之添削，則百界千如宛同府契，化城寶所盡親津橋。**

**[May they] assist in widely fanning the mysterious breeze, preparing additions and deletions for the crimson hill.[^22] Then the Hundred Realms and Thousand Suchnesses[^23] will perfectly accord like official tallies, and the Phantom City and Treasure Trove[^24] will all become intimate fords and bridges.**

[^22]: **Crimson hill** (丹丘, *dānqiū*) — Taoist term for immortal realms; here metaphor for ultimate teaching.

[^23]: **Hundred Realms and Thousand Suchnesses** (百界千如, *bǎijiè qiānrú*) — Core Tiantai doctrine: Ten Dharma Realms × Ten [mutual inclusion] = 100 Realms; each realm contains Ten Suchnesses (appearance, nature, substance, power, function, cause, condition, effect, retribution, ultimate equality) = 1,000. With three realms of existence (sentient beings, space/aggregates, five aggregates) = 3,000 dharmas in a single thought-moment (一念三千).

[^24]: **Phantom City and Treasure Trove** (化城寶所, *huàchéng bǎosuǒ*) — From Chapter 7 ("Parable of the Phantom City"): the illusory rest-stop (provisional teaching) vs. the true destination (buddhahood).

---

**賴彌勒之慇懃，迴文殊之靳固，輔《發智》之六足，褒《春秋》之一言。**

**Relying on Maitreya's diligence and reversing Mañjuśrī's obstinacy,[^25] assisting the Six Feet[^26] of the *Jñānaprasthāna*, praising the single word of the *Spring and Autumn Annals*.[^27]**

[^25]: **Maitreya's diligence, Mañjuśrī's obstinacy** — Allusion to Lotus Chapter 1, where Mañjuśrī and Maitreya dialogue about the Buddha's silence before teaching.

[^26]: **Six Feet** (六足, *liùzú*) — Six Abhidharma treatises supporting the root text (*Jñānaprasthāna*) in the Sarvāstivāda tradition. Analogy: this reorganization supports Zhiyi's root commentary.

[^27]: **Single word of Spring and Autumn** — Confucian classic attributed to Confucius; praised for moral precision in historiography. Analogy: editorial care preserves sagely intention.

---

### Section 4: Closing Dedication

**神逈等，並採綜文前輕安諦理，莫不空王佛所同共發心，十六沙彌，咸皆代講。**

**Shenjong and others, gathering together the calm truth-principles before the text, all without exception made the joint aspiration [for enlightenment] in the presence of Emptiness King Buddha.[^28] The Sixteen Śrāmaṇeras[^29] all lectured in turn.**

[^28]: **Emptiness King Buddha** (空王佛, *Kōngwáng Fó*) — Mentioned in Lotus Chapter 20 ("Never Disparaging Bodhisattva"); the ancient buddha under whom past vows were made.

[^29]: **Sixteen Śrāmaṇeras** — The sixteen princes in Chapter 7 ("Phantom City") who became buddhas in the ten directions; symbol of shared ancient vow.

---

**翳花逢日，除瘼養珠，**

**The cataract-flowers meet the sun; removing illness, we nourish the pearl.[^30]**

[^30]: **Cataract-flowers meet the sun** — Delusion vanishes in wisdom's light. **Nourishing the pearl** — Cultivating inherent buddha-nature.

---

**誠愧雁門之筆，曷窺龍嚬之奧，**

**Truly ashamed [our writing is inferior to] the brush of Yanmen;[^31] how could we peer into the profundity of the Dragon's frown?[^32]**

[^31]: **Brush of Yanmen** — Allusion to exemplary calligrapher/scholar; expression of humility.

[^32]: **Dragon's frown** — Classical idiom for profound, esoteric teaching (from Zhuangzi: the dragon's pearl is guarded beneath its jaw).

---

**庶探玄之士，沐道流而有本焉。**

**We hope that those gentlemen who explore the mysterious will bathe in the Dao's current and find their root therein.**

## 序品第一 — INTRODUCTORY CHAPTER, NUMBER ONE

### Guanding's Opening Note: The Six Difficulties

**序品第一(佛出世難，佛說是難，傳譯此難，自開悟難，聞師講難，一遍記難。余二十七於金陵聽受，六十九於丹丘添削，留贈後賢，共期佛慧)**

**Introductory Chapter, Number One**

(Six difficulties attend this teaching: The Buddha's appearance in the world is difficult; the Buddha's preaching of this [Lotus Sutra] is difficult; its transmission and translation are difficult; self-awakening through it is difficult; hearing a master lecture on it is difficult; recording it completely in one hearing is difficult. I received this teaching in Jinling[^35] at age twenty-seven; at age sixty-nine in Danqiu[^36] I added and refined it. I leave this as a gift to later worthies, that together we may attain the Buddha's wisdom.)[^37]

[^35]: **Jinling 金陵:** Present-day Nanjing, Jiangsu Province. Guanding received instruction from Zhiyi at age twenty-seven (564 CE).

[^36]: **Danqiu 丹丘:** Tiantai Mountain in Zhejiang Province, where Zhiyi resided in his later years and delivered the lectures compiled here (ca. 593 CE, when Guanding was sixty-nine).

[^37]: **The Six Difficulties:** This parenthetical note is Guanding's (灌頂, 561–632) editorial comment. Guanding was Zhiyi's principal disciple and the compiler of this text. The "six difficulties" frame the rarity and preciousness of the *Lotus Sutra*: (1) the Buddha's appearance is rare; (2) his preaching of this particular sutra is rare; (3) its accurate transmission and translation are difficult; (4) self-awakening through it is difficult; (5) hearing a qualified master lecture on it is difficult; (6) recording the entire teaching in one hearing is difficult—which Guanding himself accomplished.

### Analysis of "序" (Sequence/Introduction)

**委釋經題已如上說。「序」者，訓庠序，謂階位、賓主、問答悉庠序也。**

**The detailed explanation of the sutra's title has already been given above.[^38] As for "序" (*xù*, "sequence/introduction"), the word is glossed as *xiángxù* 庠序 ("orderly arrangement"), meaning that hierarchical positions, the relationship between host and guest, and the exchange of questions and answers are all orderly.[^39]**

[^38]: **"Already given above":** Refers to the extensive analysis of the sutra's title (*Miàofǎ Liánhuá Jīng* 妙法蓮華經) in Zhiyi's *Fahua Xuanyi* 法華玄義 (*The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra*, T.1716), which precedes this commentary in the Tiantai corpus.

[^39]: **庠序 *xiángxù*:** "Orderly arrangement." The term *xù* 序 in Buddhist sutra structure refers to the "introduction" or "prologue," but Zhiyi here etymologically glosses it as *xiángxù*, emphasizing the logical and hierarchical ordering of elements within the introduction.

---

**經家從義，謂次、由、述也。如是等五事冠於經首，次序也；放光六瑞起發之端，由序也；問答釋疑，正說弄引，敘述也。具此三義，故稱為序。**

**The compilers of the sutra[^40] follow the meaning [of *xù*] as threefold: *cì* 次 ("sequential ordering"), *yóu* 由 ("causal origin"), and *shù* 述 ("narrative exposition"). The five elements[^41] such as "Thus have I heard" that crown the beginning of the sutra constitute the *sequential introduction* (次序 *cìxù*). The emanation of light and the six auspicious signs[^42] that initiate the teaching constitute the *causal introduction* (由序 *yóuxù*). The question-and-answer exchanges that resolve doubts and draw out the main teaching constitute the *narrative introduction* (敘述 *xùshù*). Because all three meanings are present, it is called "序" (*xù*, "introduction").**

[^40]: **經家 *jīngjiā*:** "Sutra compilers," referring to the disciples (traditionally Ānanda and others) who compiled the Buddha's discourses after his parinirvāṇa at the First Buddhist Council.

[^41]: **Five elements:** The standard opening formula of Mahāyāna sutras: (1) "Thus" (*evam*, 如是); (2) "I heard" (*mayā śrutam*, 我聞); (3) time (*ekasmin samaye*, 一時); (4) place; (5) participants. This constitutes the "sequential introduction."

[^42]: **Six auspicious signs:** The *Lotus Sutra* opens with six supernatural portents: (1) the Buddha teaches the *Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings*; (2) he enters samādhi; (3) flowers rain from the sky; (4) the earth trembles; (5) the assembly rejoices; (6) the Buddha emits a ray of light from the tuft of white hair between his eyebrows, illuminating 18,000 Buddha-lands to the east.

---

### Analysis of "品" (Chapter/Section)

**「品」者，《中阿含》云跋渠，此翻為品。品者，義類同者聚在一段，故名品也。**

**As for "品" (*pǐn*, "chapter"), the *Madhyama Āgama*[^43] calls it *varga*[^44] (跋渠 *báqú*), which is translated into Chinese as *pǐn* 品. A *pǐn* is a gathering of passages of similar doctrinal category (*yìlèi* 義類) into one section; hence it is called *pǐn*.**

[^43]: ***Madhyama Āgama* 中阿含:** One of the four Āgama collections (T.26), translated by Gautama Saṃghadeva in 397–398 CE.

[^44]: ***Varga* 跋渠:** Sanskrit term meaning "section" or "chapter," transliterated into Chinese as *báqú* 跋渠 and translated as *pǐn* 品.

---

**或佛自唱品，如《梵網》；或結集所置，如《大論》；或譯人添足，如羅什。**

**Sometimes the Buddha himself announced the chapter titles, as in the *Brahmajāla Sūtra*[^45]; sometimes the compilers at the council established them, as in the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra*[^46]; sometimes the translators added them, as Kumārajīva[^47] did.**

[^45]: ***Brahmajāla Sūtra* 梵網經:** A Mahāyāna sutra on bodhisattva precepts (T.1484).

[^46]: ***Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* 大論:** The *Mahāprajñāpāramitopadeśa* (大智度論, T.1509), attributed to Nāgārjuna, translated by Kumārajīva.

[^47]: **Kumārajīva 羅什:** Kuchan monk and translator (344–413 CE) who rendered the *Lotus Sutra* (T.262, 406 CE) into Chinese — the version Zhiyi uses as his base text.

---

**今〈藥王本事〉是佛唱。〈妙音〉、〈觀音〉等是經家、譯人未聞。諸品之始，故言第一。**

**In the present sutra, [the title of] the "Former Affairs of Medicine King Bodhisattva" chapter[^48] was announced by the Buddha. [The titles of] chapters such as "Wonderful Sound" and "Avalokiteśvara"[^49] were established by the sutra compilers or translators—we have not heard [that the Buddha announced them]. Since this is the first of all the chapters, it is called "Number One."**

[^48]: **"Former Affairs of Medicine King Bodhisattva" 藥王本事:** Chapter 23 of the *Lotus Sutra* (*Bhaiṣajyarāja-pūrvayoga-parivarta*).

[^49]: **"Wonderful Sound" 妙音 and "Avalokiteśvara" 觀音:** Chapters 24 and 25, respectively.

## SECTION OVERVIEW: Exegetical Architecture (Source Lines 381-600)

This extended section establishes Zhiyi's **methodological framework** for interpreting the *Lotus Sutra*. It is the foundation upon which all subsequent commentary in the *Wenju* is built.

### Contents:

1. **Survey of Prior Structural Divisions** (lines 388-561)
   - Buddha's original "scattered" and "threaded" teachings
   - Classification systems in the Āgamas and Abhidharma
   - Critique of earlier commentators (Daolang, Sengrou, Fayun, Daosheng)
   - Zhiyi's assessment: earlier divisions either too sparse or too elaborate

2. **Zhiyi's Threefold Division** (lines 564-653)
   - **Sequence** (序分, *Introduction*): Chapter 1
   - **Main** (正宗分, *Main Body*): Chapters 2-17 (through 19 verses)
   - **Circulation** (流通分, *Propagation*): Remainder
   - Further divided into **Trace Gate** (迹門, chs. 1-14) and **Fundamental Gate** (本門, chs. 15-28)

3. **Four Methods of Interpretation** (656-768)
   - **(1) Causes and Conditions** (因緣): The karmic circumstances that occasion teaching
   - **(2) According to Teachings** (約教): Classification by the Four Teachings (Tripiṭaka, Shared, Distinct, Perfect)
   - **(3) Fundamental and Trace** (本迹): Distinguishing eternal reality from historical manifestation
   - **(4) Contemplating the Mind** (觀心): Locating the teaching within the practitioner's own realization

4. **Scriptural Evidence** (772-864)
   - Citations from *Lotus Sutra* Chapters 2, 3, 8, 16 proving the Four Methods are canonical, not Zhiyi's invention

5. **Temporal Schemas** (872-925)
   - Three frameworks for Buddha's salvific activity across time
   - Recursive structure: three lifetimes nested within nine lifetimes
   - Present, past, and perpetual future teachings all pointing back to the original enlightenment

6. **Trace/Fundamental Structure** (988-1027)
   - The "great tree" metaphor: all teachings trace back to one root
   - The Buddha's first teaching at original enlightenment is the "Fundamental"
   - All subsequent teachings (including the Royal City assembly) are "Trace"

**Pedagogical Note**: This section is the **code wiki** for the entire *Wenju*. Every subsequent chapter analysis applies these Four Methods. Understanding this architecture is essential for comprehending Tiantai exegesis.

### Survey of Prior Structural Divisions

#### Buddha's Original Discourse: Scattered vs. Threaded

**佛赴緣作散花、貫花兩說，結集者按說傳之，論者依經申之，皆不節目。**

**The Buddha responded to conditions[^50] and gave two kinds of teaching: "scattered flowers" (*sànhuā* 散花) and "threaded flowers" (*guànhuā* 貫花).[^51] The compilers at the council transmitted [the teachings] according to [the Buddha's] discourses; the treatise masters[^52] expounded them in accordance with the sutras. In neither case did they impose topical divisions (*jiémù* 節目).**

[^50]: **"Responded to conditions" 赴緣:** The Buddha's teaching always arises in response to the capacities (*jī* 機) and karmic conditions (*yuán* 緣) of his audience.

[^51]: **"Scattered flowers" and "threaded flowers":** "Scattered flowers" (*sànhuā*) refers to teachings organized topically but not in strict logical order (like flowers scattered on the ground). "Threaded flowers" (*guànhuā*) refers to teachings in a linear, logically progressive sequence (like flowers threaded on a string to form a garland).

[^52]: **Treatise masters 論者:** *Śāstra*-kāras, Indian Buddhist philosophers who composed commentarial treatises (*śāstra*, 論).

---

**古講師但敷弘義理、不分章段，若純用此意，後生殆不識起盡。**

**The ancient lecturers merely expounded the doctrinal principles broadly without dividing the text into chapters and sections. If this approach were used exclusively, later students would scarcely recognize where [arguments] begin and end.**

---

#### Classification Systems in the Āgamas

**又佛說貫、散，集者隨義立品。《增一》云：契經一分，律一分，阿毘曇一分。契經更開四，謂《增一》、《長》、《中》、《雜》。**

**Moreover, the Buddha taught in both "threaded" and "scattered" modes, and the compilers established chapters according to doctrinal meaning. The *Ekottara Āgama*[^53] says: one division is sūtras, one division is vinaya, one division is abhidharma. The sūtra division is further opened into four: the *Ekottara*, the *Dīrgha*, the *Madhyama*, and the *Saṃyukta*.[^54]**

[^53]: ***Ekottara Āgama* 增一阿含:** Chinese translation (T.125) corresponding to the Pāli *Aṅguttara Nikāya*.

[^54]: **Four Āgamas:** (1) *Ekottara* 增一 (*Aṅguttara*); (2) *Dīrgha* 長 (*Dīgha*); (3) *Madhyama* 中 (*Majjhima*); (4) *Saṃyukta* 雜 (*Saṃyutta*).

---

**《增一阿含》明人天因果，《長阿含》破邪見，《中阿含》明深義，《雜阿含》明禪定。**

**The *Ekottara Āgama* clarifies the causes and effects [of rebirth] among humans and devas; the *Dīrgha Āgama* refutes heterodox views; the *Madhyama Āgama* clarifies profound meanings; the *Saṃyukta Āgama* clarifies meditative concentration (*dhyāna*).**

---

**律開五部及八十誦。阿毘曇開《六足》、《八犍度》等。**

**The vinaya is divided into five schools[^55] and the eighty recitations. The abhidharma is divided into the *Six Pādas*[^56] and the *Eight Skandhakas*,[^57] among others.**

[^55]: **Five schools of vinaya:** Dharmaguptaka (四分律, T.1428), Mahāsāṃghika (T.1425), Sarvāstivāda (十誦律, T.1435), Mahīśāsaka (五分律, T.1421), Mūlasarvāstivāda (T.1442–1451).

[^56]: **Six Pādas 六足:** The six foundational Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma texts: *Saṅgītiparyāya*, *Dharmaskandha*, *Prajñaptipāda*, *Vijñānakāya*, *Dhātukāya*, *Prakaraṇapāda*.

[^57]: **Eight Skandhakas 八犍度:** The *Aṣṭa-grantha*, an alternative Abhidharma organizational scheme. *Skandhaka* (犍度 *jiàndù*) means "aggregate" or "chapter."

---

**《阿含》謂：「施、戒、慧、六度皆足也，謂根、性、道、定等八種聚也。」**

**The Āgama says: "Giving, morality, wisdom, and the six pāramitās are all 'feet' (*pāda*)"; [it also] says: "Faculties, natures, paths, concentrations, and so forth constitute the eight kinds of 'gatherings' (*skandhaka*)."[^58]**

[^58]: **"Feet" and "gatherings":** Zhiyi explains the etymology of *pāda* 足 ("foot," i.e., foundational text) and *skandhaka* 犍度 ("aggregate/gathering").

---

**天親作論，以七功德分〈序品〉，五示現分〈方便品〉，其餘品各有處分。**

**Vasubandhu[^59] composed a treatise in which he divided the "Introductory" chapter using seven merits,[^60] divided the "Skillful Means" chapter using five manifestations,[^61] and divided each of the remaining chapters according to its respective topic.**

[^59]: **Vasubandhu 天親:** (ca. 4th–5th c. CE), author of the *Commentary on the Lotus Sutra* (*Saddharmapuṇḍarīka-upadeśa*, T.1519).

[^60]: **Seven merits 七功德:** Vasubandhu's divisions of the Introductory chapter: (1) demonstration of cause; (2) assembly; (3) time; (4) place; (5) the preacher; (6) the Dharma; (7) the audience.

[^61]: **Five manifestations 五示現:** Vasubandhu's analysis of the "Skillful Means" chapter: (1) the unique character of the Tathāgata; (2) the difficulty of encountering [this teaching]; (3) the rarity of faith; (4) the non-duality of the three vehicles; (5) the singularity of the Buddha Vehicle.

---

#### Specific Prior Commentators

**昔河西憑、江東瑤，取此意節目經文，末代尤煩。**

**In former times, Feng of Hexi[^62] and Yao of Jiangdong[^63] adopted this approach and imposed topical divisions on the sutra text. In the degenerate age, [such divisions] became especially cumbersome.**

[^62]: **Feng of Hexi 河西憑:** Daolang (道朗, 411–481), a prominent *Lotus Sutra* scholar based in the Hexi Corridor (present-day Gansu).

[^63]: **Yao of Jiangdong 江東瑤:** Sengrou (僧柔, 431–494) of the Liu Song dynasty, based south of the Yangtze River.

---

**光宅轉細，重雰翳於太清，三光為之戢耀，問津者所不貴。**

**Guangzhai[^64] made them even finer, [until they were like] layered mists obscuring the Great Clarity—the sun, moon, and stars concealed their radiance, and those who inquired after the ford[^65] did not value [such divisions].**

[^64]: **Guangzhai 光宅:** Fayun (Yun, 法雲, 467–529), a famous *Lotus Sutra* commentator of the Liang dynasty who resided at Guangzhai Temple in Jiankang (present-day Nanjing).

[^65]: **"Inquired after the ford" 問津:** Allusion to *Analects* 18.6. Here: sincere seekers of the Dharma.

---

**曇鸞云：「細科煙颺，雜礪塵飛。」蓋若過、若不及也。**

**Tanluan[^66] said: "Minute divisions scatter like smoke; miscellaneous analyses fly like dust." This illustrates [divisions that are] either excessive or insufficient.[^67]**

[^66]: **Tanluan 曇鸞:** (476–542), a Pure Land master and author of the *Commentary on the Treatise on Rebirth in the Pure Land* (T.1819).

[^67]: **"Excessive or insufficient":** Allusion to the Confucian doctrine of the "Mean" (*Zhongyong* 中庸).

---

#### Daosheng's Structural Division

**廬山龍師，分文為序、正、流通，二十七品統唯兩種：從〈序〉至〈法師〉，言方便、言真實，理一說三故；〈寶塔〉下，身方便、身真實，實遠唱近故。**

**Master Long[^68] of Lushan divided the text into Sequence, Main, and Circulation. The twenty-seven chapters[^69] are unified into just two categories: From the "Introductory" chapter through the "Dharma Teacher" chapter concerns *verbal skillful means* and *verbal reality*—because [the Buddha] teaches three [vehicles] based on the principle of the One [Vehicle]. From the "Jeweled Stupa" chapter onward concerns *bodily skillful means* and *bodily reality*—because [the Buddha's] reality is the remote [eternal lifespan], yet he proclaims the near [historical manifestation].[^70]**

[^68]: **Master Long 龍師:** Daosheng (道生, ca. 360–434), one of the most influential early Chinese Buddhist exegetes, associated with Lushan (廬山, Mount Lu in Jiangxi Province). Famous for his doctrine of "sudden enlightenment" and his assertion that *icchantika*s possess Buddha-nature.

[^69]: **Twenty-seven chapters:** Daosheng's analysis predates the addition of the "Devadatta" chapter (ch. 12 in Kumārajīva's final recension), which was originally part of the "Jeweled Stupa" chapter.

[^70]: **Verbal and bodily skillful means/reality:** The first half concerns the Buddha's *verbal* teaching of the One Vehicle; the second half concerns the *bodily* manifestation of the Buddha's eternal lifespan.

---

**又從〈方便〉至〈安樂行〉是因門，從〈踊出〉下是果門。**

**Furthermore, from "Skillful Means" through "Peaceful Practices" constitutes the *Cause Gate* (*yīnmén* 因門); from "Springing Up from the Earth" onward constitutes the *Fruit Gate* (*guǒmén* 果門).[^71]**

[^71]: **Cause Gate and Fruit Gate:** The "Cause Gate" concerns the bodhisattva path (causes leading to Buddhahood); the "Fruit Gate" concerns the Buddha's realization (fruition). Chapter 15 marks the shift.

---

**齊中興印、小山瑤，從龍受經，分文同。**

**Yin of Zhongxing[^72] [during the Qi dynasty] and Yao of Xiaoshan received the sutra from [Master] Long and used the same textual divisions.**

[^72]: **Yin of Zhongxing 中興印:** A *Lotus* scholar of the Qi dynasty (479–502 or 550–577).

---

#### Xuanchang's Division

**玄暢從〈序〉至〈多寶〉為因分，從〈勸持〉至〈神力〉為果分，從〈囑累〉盡經為護持分。**

**Xuanchang[^73] [divided the text as follows]: From "Introductory" through "Abundant Treasures" constitutes the *Cause Section*; from "Exhortation to Maintain" through "Spiritual Powers" constitutes the *Fruit Section*; from "Entrustment" through the end of the sutra constitutes the *Protection and Maintenance Section*.**

[^73]: **Xuanchang 玄暢:** A *Lotus* commentator of the Liu Song or Northern Wei period.

---

#### Anonymous Threefold Division

**又有師云：「從〈序〉至〈學無學人記〉，是《法華》體；從〈法師〉至〈囑累〉，明受持功德；從〈藥王〉盡經，美諸菩薩本願。」**

**Another master said: "From 'Introductory' through 'Prophecy for Those in Training and Those Beyond Training' constitutes the *essence* (*tǐ* 體) of the *Lotus Sutra*; from 'Dharma Teacher' through 'Entrustment' clarifies the merit of receiving and maintaining [the sutra]; from 'Medicine King' through the end of the sutra praises the original vows of the various bodhisattvas."**

---

#### Anonymous Fourfold Division

**有師作四段：初品為序段；從〈方便〉至〈安樂行〉，開三顯一段；從〈踊出〉訖〈分別功德〉，開近顯遠段；後去餘勢，流通段。**

**Another master created four sections: The first chapter constitutes the *Sequence Section*; from "Skillful Means" through "Peaceful Practices" constitutes the section of *opening the three [vehicles] and revealing the One [Vehicle]*[^74]; from "Springing Up from the Earth" through "Distinction of Merits" constitutes the section of *opening the near [manifestation] and revealing the remote [reality]*; the remainder constitutes the *Circulation Section*.**

[^74]: **Opening the three, revealing the One (開三顯一):** The three vehicles (śrāvaka, pratyekabuddha, bodhisattva) are provisional; only the One Buddha Vehicle is ultimate.

---

#### Guangzhai Yun's Elaborate Division

**光宅雲從印受經，初三段次各開二，謂通序、別序，正謂因門、果門，流通謂化他、自行。二序各五，二正各四，二流通各三，合二十四段(云云)。**

**Yun of Guangzhai[^75] received the sutra from [Master] Yin. He divided the initial three sections, each further opened into two: Sequence is divided into *General Sequence* (*tōngxù* 通序) and *Specific Sequence* (*biéxù* 別序); Main is divided into *Cause Gate* and *Fruit Gate*; Circulation is divided into *Transforming Others* (*huàtā* 化他) and *Self-Cultivation* (*zìxíng* 自行). The two Sequences each have five [subdivisions]; the two Main [sections] each have four; the two Circulations each have three—totaling twenty-four sections.[^76]**

[^75]: **Yun of Guangzhai 光宅雲:** Fayun (法雲, 467–529). His twenty-four-section division is critiqued by Zhiyi as overly complex.

[^76]: **(云云):** Abbreviation indicating "and so forth." Full details of Fayun's subdivisions omitted.

---

### Zhiyi's Critique and His Own Division

**夫分節經文悉是人情，蘭菊各擅其美，後生不應是非諍競，無三益、喪一道。三益者，世界等三悉檀也；一道者，第一義悉檀也。**

**Now, all divisions and sections of the sutra text are [products of] human interpretation (*rénqíng* 人情). Orchids and chrysanthemums each excel in their own beauty.[^77] Later students should not engage in disputes over right and wrong, [lest they] forfeit the three benefits and lose the One Path. The "three benefits" are the three *siddhāntas*[^78]—Worldly, Therapeutic, and Individual; the "One Path" is the *siddhānta* of Ultimate Truth (*dìyīyì xītán* 第一義悉檀).[^79]**

[^77]: **"Orchids and chrysanthemums":** Traditional Chinese metaphor (from *Chu Ci* 楚辭) for diversity of excellence. Zhiyi urges tolerance of different approaches.

[^78]: ***Siddhānta* 悉檀:** The four modes of teaching: (1) Worldly (*loka*, 世界悉檀); (2) Individual (*puruṣa*, 各各為人悉檀); (3) Therapeutic (*pratipakṣa*, 對治悉檀); (4) Ultimate Truth (*paramārtha*, 第一義悉檀).

[^79]: **Ultimate Truth siddhānta:** The highest siddhānta, pointing directly to *paramārtha-satya* (ultimate truth). To quarrel over textual divisions is to lose sight of this goal.

---

#### The Threefold Division

**天台智者分文為三：初品為序；〈方便品〉訖〈分別功德〉十九行偈，凡十五品半，名正；從偈後盡經，凡十一品半，名流通。**

**The Wise Master (*Zhìzhě*) of Tiantai divided the text into three [sections]: The first chapter constitutes the *Sequence* (*xù* 序); from the "Skillful Means" chapter through the nineteen-line verse in the "Distinction of Merits" chapter—a total of fifteen and a half chapters—constitutes the *Main* (*zhèng* 正) [section]; from the end of that verse through the end of the sutra—a total of eleven and a half chapters—constitutes the *Circulation* (*liútōng* 流通) [section].[^80]**

[^80]: **Zhiyi's threefold division:** (1) *Sequence* (ch. 1); (2) *Main* (ch. 2 through nineteen lines of verse in ch. 17); (3) *Circulation* (remainder of ch. 17 through ch. 28).

---

#### The Trace/Fundamental Twofold Division

**又一時分為二：從序至〈安樂行〉十四品，約迹開權顯實；從〈踊出〉訖經十四品，約本開權顯實。本迹各序、正、流通。**

**Furthermore, the entire [sutra] is divided into two: From the Sequence through "Peaceful Practices"—fourteen chapters—concerns *opening the provisional and revealing the real with regard to the Trace* (*yuē jì kāiquán xiǎnshí* 約迹開權顯實); from "Springing Up from the Earth" through the end of the sutra—fourteen chapters—concerns *opening the provisional and revealing the real with regard to the Fundamental* (*yuē běn kāiquán xiǎnshí* 約本開權顯實).[^81] Both the Fundamental and the Trace each have Sequence, Main, and Circulation [sections].**

[^81]: **Trace and Fundamental:** The *Lotus Sutra*'s two halves: (1) *Trace Gate* (迹門, chs. 1–14)—teachings by the historical Buddha; (2) *Fundamental Gate* (本門, chs. 15–28)—revelation of the Buddha's eternal enlightenment. Chapter 16 ("The Tathāgata's Lifespan") is the pivot.

---

#### Trace Gate Structure

**初品為序，〈方便〉訖〈授學無學人記品〉為正，〈法師〉訖〈安樂行〉為流通。**

**[In the Trace Gate:] The first chapter constitutes the Sequence; from "Skillful Means" through "Prophecy for Those in Training and Those Beyond Training" constitutes the Main; from "Dharma Teacher" through "Peaceful Practices" constitutes the Circulation.**

---

#### Fundamental Gate Structure

**〈踊出〉訖「彌勒已問斯事佛今答之」半品，名序；從「佛告阿逸多」下，訖〈分別功德品〉偈，名為正；此後盡經為流通。**

**[In the Fundamental Gate:] From "Springing Up from the Earth" through "Maitreya has already asked about this matter; the Buddha now answers it"—half a chapter[^82]—constitutes the Sequence; from "The Buddha told Ajita"[^83] onward through the verse in the "Distinction of Merits" chapter constitutes the Main; from that point through the end of the sutra constitutes the Circulation.**

[^82]: **"Half a chapter":** Chapter 15 serves double duty as the Sequence for the Fundamental Gate.

[^83]: **"Ajita" 阿逸多:** A name for Maitreya Bodhisattva meaning "Invincible." "The Buddha told Ajita" marks the beginning of chapter 16's revelation.

---

**今記從前三段消文也。**

**The present commentary explicates the text according to the former threefold division.**

---

### Question and Answer: Why Two Sequences?

**問：**

**一經云何二序？**

**Question:**

**How can one sutra have two Sequences?**

---

**答：**

**《華嚴》處處集眾，《阿含》篇篇如是，《大品》前後付囑，皆不乖一部，兩序阿妨？**

**Answer:**

**The *Avataṃsaka Sūtra*[^84] has assemblies in multiple locations; the *Āgama* [sutras] each begin with "Thus [have I heard]"; the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra*[^85] has entrustments at both the beginning and the end—yet none of these contradict the unity of a single text. How would two Sequences be problematic?**

[^84]: ***Avataṃsaka Sūtra* 華嚴:** The *Buddhāvataṃsaka-mahāvaipulya-sūtra* (T.278, 279, 293), which describes the Buddha teaching in multiple celestial locations.

[^85]: ***Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra* 大品:** The "Large Perfection of Wisdom Sutra" (T.223), translated by Kumārajīva in 404 CE.

---

**今不安五義者，本門非次首故也。迹門但單流通者，說法未竟也，有無之意云爾。**

**The reason the present [division] does not include the five elements [in the Fundamental Gate's Sequence] is that the Fundamental Gate is not the initial beginning [of the sutra]. The reason the Trace Gate has only a single Circulation [section] is that the preaching of the Dharma is not yet complete. Such is the meaning of [the Circulation's] presence or absence.[^86]**

[^86]: **Trace Gate's single Circulation:** The Trace Gate Circulation is provisional because the teaching is not yet complete—the Fundamental Gate revelation is still to come.

---

### Establishing the Four Methods of Interpretation (四意消文)

**今帖文為四：一、列數；二、所以；三、引證；四、示相。**

**The present [commentary's] approach to the text (*tiēwén* 帖文) consists of four [methods]: (1) Enumerating the number [of methods]; (2) [Explaining] the rationale; (3) Citing evidence; (4) Indicating the characteristics.**

---

#### 1. Enumerating the Number

**列數者：一因緣、二約教、三本迹、四觀心。始從「如是」終于「而退」，皆以四意消文，而今略書，或三、二、一，貴在得意不煩筆墨。**

**Enumerating the number: (1) Causes and Conditions (*yīnyuán* 因緣); (2) According to the Teachings (*yuējiào* 約教); (3) Fundamental and Trace (*běnjì* 本迹); (4) Contemplating the Mind (*guānxīn* 觀心).[^87] From the opening "Thus [have I heard]" to the conclusion "and withdrew," all [passages] are explicated using these four approaches (*sìyì* 四意). However, in the present [commentary], we write concisely—sometimes [using] three [methods], two, or one—because the priority is grasping the meaning, not exhausting ink and paper.**

[^87]: **The Four Methods of Interpretation (四意消文):** (1) *Causes and Conditions*—the karmic causes and spiritual capacities that occasioned the teaching; (2) *According to the Teachings*—interpretation by doctrinal classification (Four Teachings: Tripiṭaka, Shared, Distinct, Perfect); (3) *Fundamental and Trace*—distinguishing eternal reality from historical manifestation; (4) *Contemplating the Mind*—locating the teaching within the practitioner's own mind.

---

#### 2. The Rationale

**二、所以者，**

**[2] The rationale:**

---

#### Question and Answer: Why Four Methods?

**問：**

**若略則一，若廣匪四，所以云何？**

**Question:**

**If [one seeks] conciseness, then one [method suffices]; if [one seeks] comprehensiveness, why [limit it to] four? What is the rationale?**

---

**答：**

**廣則令智退，略則意不周，我今處中說，令義易明了。**

**Answer:**

**If [the exposition is] too comprehensive, it causes wisdom to retreat; if too concise, the meaning is not thorough. I now take the middle path in my explanation, so that the meaning is easily clarified.**

---

##### Causes and Conditions (Method 1)

**因緣亦名感應，眾生無機雖近不見，慈善根力遠而自通，感應道交故，用因緣釋也。**

***Causes and Conditions* is also called *Stimulus and Response* (*gǎnyìng* 感應).[^89] If sentient beings lack the capacity (*jī* 機), they will not perceive [the Buddha] even if he is near; [but when] the power of compassionate roots arises, they spontaneously connect [with him] even from afar. Because stimulus and response meet on the path (*gǎnyìng dàojiāo* 感應道交), we employ the interpretation by Causes and Conditions.**

[^89]: **Stimulus and Response 感應:** *Gǎn* 感 ("stimulus") = the sentient being's karmic capacity; *yìng* 應 ("response") = the Buddha's compassionate manifestation. When the two "meet on the path" (*dàojiāo*), liberation occurs.

---

**夫眾生求脫，此機眾矣；聖人起應，應亦眾矣。此義更廣，處中在何？**

**Now, sentient beings seeking liberation—their capacities are manifold; sages arising in response—their responses are also manifold. This meaning is even more vast. Where is the middle [path]?**

---

**然《大經》云：「慈善根力有無量門，略則神通，若十方機感，曠若虛空。」**

**Nevertheless, the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*[^90] says: "The power of compassionate roots has immeasurable gates; in brief, [they are manifested through] spiritual powers. The capacities and responses of the ten directions are as vast as empty space."**

[^90]: ***Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* 大經:** The *Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa-sūtra* (T.374, 375).

---

**今論娑婆國土音聲佛事則甘露門開，依教釋者中說明矣。**

**The present [commentary] discusses the Buddha's work through sound[^91] in the Sahā world, whereby the gate of ambrosia[^92] is opened. The interpretation *according to the teachings* is the middle explanation.**

[^91]: **"Buddha's work through sound" 音聲佛事:** The Sahā world is characterized by the Buddha teaching primarily through verbal discourse, in contrast to other Buddha-lands.

[^92]: **"Gate of ambrosia" 甘露門:** *Amṛta* (甘露, "sweet dew") — the Dharma that liberates from saṃsāra.

---

##### Fundamental and Trace (Method 3)

**若應機設教，教有權實、淺深不同，須置指存月、亡迹尋本。**

**If [we consider] teaching established in response to capacities, the teachings differ in being provisional or real, shallow or profound. One must "discard the finger and preserve the moon,"[^93] "abandon the traces and seek the fundamental."**

[^93]: **"Discard the finger, preserve the moon":** From the *Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra* and *Śūraṃgama Sūtra*: the teaching is a finger pointing at the moon; one must look at the moon (ultimate truth), not fixate on the finger.

---

**故肇師云：「非本無以垂迹，非迹無以顯本。」故用本迹釋也。**

**Therefore Master Zhao[^94] said: "Without the Fundamental, there is no way to extend the Trace; without the Trace, there is no way to reveal the Fundamental." Hence we employ the interpretation by Fundamental and Trace.**

[^94]: **Master Zhao 肇師:** Sengzhao (僧肇, 384–414), disciple of Kumārajīva, author of the *Zhao Lun* 肇論 (T.1858). This aphorism encapsulates the non-duality of Fundamental and Trace.

---

##### Contemplating the Mind (Method 4)

**若尋迹，迹廣徒自疲勞，若尋本，本高高不可極，日夜數他寶，自無半錢分，但觀己心之高廣，扣無窮之聖應，機成致感，逮得己利，故用觀心釋也。**

**If one traces the Trace, the Trace is vast and one merely exhausts oneself; if one seeks the Fundamental, the Fundamental is lofty and cannot be fathomed. [To do so is like] counting another's treasure day and night—one does not possess even half a penny.[^95] One should simply contemplate the loftiness and vastness of one's own mind, knock upon the inexhaustible sagely response, perfect one's capacity and elicit the response, and thereby attain one's own benefit. Hence we employ the interpretation by Contemplating the Mind.[^96]**

[^95]: **"Counting another's treasure":** Allusion to the *Lotus Sutra*, chapter 8 ("Prophecy of Five Hundred Disciples"): a poor man sleeps in a rich friend's house, unaware of a priceless jewel sewn into his robe. Zhiyi warns that studying the Buddha's attributes without awakening to one's own Buddha-nature is futile.

[^96]: **Contemplating the Mind 觀心:** The fourth method directs the practitioner to recognize that all teachings are about one's own mind. The Buddha's mind and one's own mind are identical in nature. This is the Tiantai doctrine of inherent enlightenment.

---

---

## 三、引證 (Part 3: Citing Evidence)

### Scriptural Evidence for the Four Methods

**〈方便品〉云：「十方諸佛為一大事因緣故出現於世。」**

**The *Expedient Means Chapter* states: "The Buddhas of the ten directions appear in the world for the sake of the One Great Matter of causes and conditions."[^97]**

[^97]: **一大事因緣** (*yī dàshì yīnyuán*) — The "One Great Matter" refers to the singular purpose of all Buddhas: opening beings to the Buddha's knowledge and vision (佛知見). This phrase from the Lotus Sutra (Skt. *Saddharmapuṇḍarīka-sūtra*, Chapter 2) became foundational for Tiantai's doctrine that all provisional teachings are expedient means (*upāya*) leading to this sole aim. See T.262.9.7a.

---

**若人天、小乘，非一、非大，又非佛事，不成機感。**

**If it were [merely teaching] human and celestial [vehicles], or the Lesser Vehicle, it would be neither "one" nor "great," and moreover it would not constitute "the Buddha's affair" (*buddhakārya*), thus failing to establish the resonance between capacity and response (*jīgǎn* 機感).[^98]**

[^98]: **機感** (*jīgǎn*) — The resonance between sentient beings' spiritual capacity (機 *jī*) and the Buddha's responsive teaching (感 *gǎn*). Tiantai doctrine holds that the Buddha's appearance is conditioned by this mutual resonance, not arbitrary. If the teaching aimed only at worldly elevation (人天 *réntiān*) or Arhatship (小乘 *xiǎoshèng*), it would not fulfill the universal salvific scope implied by "one great matter."

---

**實相名一，廣博名大，佛指此為事，出現於世，是名一大事因緣也。**

**True Mark (*shíxiàng* 實相) is called "one"; vast and comprehensive is called "great"; the Buddha points to this as the "matter," appearing in the world — this is called the "One Great Matter of causes and conditions."[^99]**

[^99]: **實相** (*shíxiàng*, Skt. *bhūtatathatā*/*dharmatā*) — Ultimate reality, the true nature of all phenomena, beyond conceptual elaboration. In Tiantai, *shíxiàng* is synonymous with the Middle Truth (中諦), encompassing emptiness and provisional existence non-dually. Zhiyi identifies the Buddha's entire teaching career as pointing beings toward direct realization of this singular reality.

---

**又云：「以種種法門，宣示於佛道。」當知種種聲教，若微若著、若權若實，皆為佛道而作筌罤。**

**[The sutra] also says: "By means of various Dharma gates, [the Buddhas] proclaim and reveal the Buddha-path."[^100] You should understand: the various verbal teachings (*shēngjiào* 聲教), whether subtle or manifest, whether provisional (*quán* 權) or real (*shí* 實), all serve as fish-traps and rabbit-snares for the Buddha-path.[^101]**

[^100]: Lotus Sutra, Chapter 2 (T.262.9.8b). The "various Dharma gates" (種種法門) refers to the diversity of skillful means (*upāya*) employed across the Five Periods of teaching.

[^101]: **筌罤** (*quán fú*) — Fish-trap (*quán*) and rabbit-snare (*fú*), from *Zhuangzi* 26: "The trap is for the fish; once you've got the fish, you forget the trap." Here, all provisional doctrines are instruments to be discarded once the practitioner realizes the Buddha-path directly. Zhiyi uses this Daoist metaphor to critique attachment to doctrinal formulations while affirming their provisional necessity.

**《大經》云：「麁言及軟語，皆歸第一義。」此之謂也。**

**The *Great Sūtra* states: "Coarse speech and soft speech both return to the First Meaning."[^102] This is what is meant here.**

[^102]: ***Great Sūtra* 大經** — Refers to the *Mahāparinirvāṇa-sūtra* (T.374.12.524c). "First Meaning" (第一義 *dìyīyì*, Skt. *paramārtha*) is ultimate truth. The quotation underscores that even harsh polemics and gentle encouragement are expedient means converging on non-dual wisdom.

---

**〈壽量品〉云：「今天人阿修羅，皆謂我少出家，出釋氏宮，去伽耶城不遠，得三菩提。然我實成佛已來，無量無邊阿僧祇劫，以斯方便導利眾生。」**

**The *Life Span Chapter* states: "Now gods, humans, and asuras all think that I, when young, left home, departed the Śākya palace, and at a place not far from Gayā City attained *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*.[^103] However, I actually achieved Buddhahood limitless, boundless *asaṃkhyeya* kalpas ago, and by these expedient means guide and benefit sentient beings."[^104]**

[^103]: **三菩提** (*sān pútí*, Skt. *samyak-saṃbodhi*) — Here abbreviated; full form is 阿耨多羅三藐三菩提 (*anòuduōluó sānmiǎo sān pútí*), supreme perfect enlightenment. Gayā City (伽耶城) is Bodh Gayā, where the historical Buddha is traditionally said to have awakened under the bodhi tree.

[^104]: This passage from Chapter 16 of the Lotus Sutra (T.262.9.42b-c) is the scriptural foundation for Tiantai's Trace/Original (迹門/本門) hermeneutic. The "Trace" (迹) is the historical manifestation in India; the "Original" (本) is the eternal Buddhahood realized eons ago. Zhiyi cites this to prove that the Causes & Conditions method encompasses both temporal scales.

---

**〈方便品〉又云：「我本立誓願，普令一切眾，亦同得此道，如我等無異。」**

**The *Expedient Means Chapter* further states: "I originally established a vow-aspiration to universally enable all beings to likewise attain this path, making them equal to me without difference."[^105]**

[^105]: Lotus Sutra, Chapter 2 (T.262.9.5c). This vow expresses the Buddha's original intent (*běn* 本), establishing the Causes & Conditions method as the engine of universal Buddhahood. The phrase "equal to me without difference" (如我等無異) grounds Tiantai's claim that the Lotus Sutra reveals the Buddha Vehicle (佛乘 *Fóshèng*) as the sole final refuge, subsuming the Three Vehicles.

---

**又〈五百受記品〉云：「內祕菩薩行，外現是聲聞，實自淨佛土，示眾有三毒，又現邪見相；我弟子如是，方便度眾生。」**

**The *Chapter on Five Hundred Disciples Receiving Prophecy* also states: "Inwardly they keep secret the bodhisattva practices; outwardly they manifest as śrāvakas. In reality they purify their own Buddha-lands, yet show to the multitude [the appearance of] possessing the three poisons (*sāndú* 三毒, Skt. *triviṣa*: greed, hatred, delusion), and even manifest the marks of wrong views. My disciples are like this, using expedient means to liberate sentient beings."[^106]**

[^106]: Lotus Sutra, Chapter 8 (T.262.9.28c). This verse describes great arhats like Pūrṇa who appear as śrāvakas but are secretly bodhisattvas. Zhiyi cites it to prove that the Trace/Original structure applies not only to the Buddha but to his disciples, reinforcing the Causes & Conditions method's scope.

---

**此則師弟皆明本迹(云云)。**

**Thus both master and disciples illuminate [the structure of] Original and Trace, and so forth.[^108]**

[^108]: **(云云)** — Abbreviation marker indicating "etc." or "the implications are extensive." Zhiyi uses this to signal that further elaboration is available in oral teaching or supplementary texts.

---

**〈譬喻品〉云：「若人信汝所說，即為見我亦見於汝，及比丘僧并諸菩薩。」**

**The *Parables Chapter* states: "If a person has faith in what you proclaim, they thereby see me, and also see you, as well as the *bhikṣu* saṅgha and the bodhisattvas."[^109]**

[^109]: Lotus Sutra, Chapter 3 (T.262.9.12c). The Buddha addresses Śāriputra: faith in the teaching is equivalent to direct vision of the Three Jewels. This grounds the Contemplation of Mind method (觀心釋), where faith becomes the site of Buddha-encounter.

---

**當知隨有所聞，諦心觀察，於信心中得見三寶：聞說是法寶，見我是佛寶，見汝等是僧寶(云云)。**

**You should understand: wherever there is hearing [of the Dharma], if one observes with a discerning mind, within the mind of faith one sees the Three Jewels: hearing the teaching is the Dharma Jewel, seeing me is the Buddha Jewel, seeing you and others is the Saṅgha Jewel, and so forth.**

## 四、示相 (Part 4: Indicating Characteristics)

### Application to the Threefold Division

**且約三段示因緣相。**

**For now, we indicate the characteristics of [the method of] causes and conditions by reference to the three divisions [of the sutra].**

---

**眾生久遠蒙佛善巧，令種佛道因緣，中間相值，更以異方便助顯第一義而成熟之。今日雨花動地，以如來滅度而滅度之。**

**From the distant past, sentient beings have received the Buddha's skillful means, enabling them to plant the causes and conditions of the Buddha-path. In the intervening periods, [the Buddha and beings] encountered one another repeatedly, and [the Buddha] further employed different expedient means to assist in revealing the First Meaning, thereby ripening [their capacities]. Today, with the rain of flowers and the trembling of the earth,[^110] [the Buddha] brings them to extinction (*nirvāṇa*) by means of the Tathāgata's extinction.[^111]**

[^110]: The "rain of flowers and trembling of the earth" (雨花動地) refers to the miraculous portents described in the Lotus Sutra's *Introductory Chapter* (序品), signaling the impending revelation of the supreme teaching.

[^111]: "Extinction by means of the Tathāgata's extinction" (以如來滅度而滅度之) — A technical phrase indicating that beings' liberation (*nirvāṇa*) is not separate from realizing the Buddha's own nirvāṇa. This collapses the distinction between teacher and student in the moment of awakening.

---

#### Temporal Schema 1: Distant/Past/Recent

**復次，久遠為種，過去為熟，近世為脫，地涌等是也。**

**Furthermore: the distant past served as planting; the [more recent] past as ripening; the recent age as liberation. The [Bodhisattvas] Emerging from the Earth and others exemplify this.[^112]**

[^112]: **地涌** (*dìyǒng*) — The Bodhisattvas Emerging from the Earth (從地涌出菩薩), who appear in Chapter 15 of the Lotus Sutra. Their emergence proves that Śākyamuni has been teaching since limitless kalpas ago, as they are his disciples from the distant past. This schema (遠/過去/近 = seed/ripen/liberate) structures the relationship between Original Gate teaching and historical manifestation.

---

#### Temporal Schema 2: Middle/Four Flavors/Royal City

**復次，中間為種，四味為熟，王城為脫，今之開示悟入者也。**

**Furthermore: the middle period served as planting; the Four Flavors served as ripening; [the teaching at] the Royal City served as liberation. This is [the schema for] those who are now opened, shown, awakened, and entered.[^113]**

[^113]: **四味** (*sìwèi*) — The first four of the Five Flavors (五時五味): Huáyán, Āgama, Vaipulya, and Prajñā periods. These are provisional teachings preparing beings for the Lotus. "Royal City" (王城) is Rājagṛha, where the Lotus Sutra was preached. "Opened, shown, awakened, and entered" (開示悟入) are the Four Buddha-Wisdoms from Chapter 2 of the Lotus Sutra.

---

#### Temporal Schema 3: Present/Next/Later Lives

**復次，今世為種，次世為熟，後世為脫，未來得度者是也。雖未是本門，取意說耳。**

**Furthermore: the present life serves as planting; the next life as ripening; a later life as liberation. This applies to those who will be delivered in the future. Although this is not yet [explicitly] the Original Gate (*běnmén* 本門), I am drawing out the implication.[^114]**

[^114]: **本門** (*běnmén*) — The "Original Gate," Chapters 15–28 of the Lotus Sutra, revealing the Buddha's eternal existence. Zhiyi notes that this third schema (present/next/later lives) is still operating within the Trace Gate framework but anticipates the recursive temporal logic of the Original Gate.

---

#### Recursive Temporal Structure (Nine Lifetimes)

**其間節節作三世九世，為種、為熟、為脫，亦應無妨。何以故？如來自在神通之力，師子奮迅大勢威猛之力，自在說也。**

**In between [these major periods], segment by segment one may also construct [schemas of] three lifetimes or nine lifetimes,[^115] [analyzing them] as planting, ripening, and liberation — this too should cause no obstruction. Why [is this permissible]? Because the Tathāgata possesses the power of sovereign supernatural penetration (*abhijñā*), the power of the lion's vigorous advance, and the power of great majestic ferocity, [and thus] teaches with sovereign freedom [across all temporal scales].**

[^115]: **三世九世** (*sānshì jiǔshì*) — "Three lifetimes" (past, present, future) can be recursively subdivided: each of the three contains its own past, present, and future, yielding nine. This nested structure mirrors Huáyán's doctrine of interpenetrating time and anticipates Tiantai's claim that the Buddha's salvific activity operates across infinite temporal scales.

---

### Functional Necessity of the Three Divisions

**以如是等故，有序分也。眾見希有瑞，顒顒欽渴，欲聞具足道，佛乘機設化，開示悟入佛之知見，故有正說分也。**

**For these reasons and so forth, there is the Sequence Division (*xùfēn* 序分). The assembly sees the rare portents and, heads raised in reverent longing, desires to hear the complete path. The Buddha, riding the [opportune] capacity, establishes the teaching and opens, shows, awakens [them to], and causes them to enter the Buddha's knowledge and vision. Therefore there is the Main Teaching Division (*zhèng shuō fēn* 正說分).**

---

**非但當時獲大利益，後五百歲遠沾妙道，故有流通分也。**

**Not only do [beings] at that time obtain great benefit, but in the latter five hundred years [after the Buddha's parinirvāṇa][^116] they will remotely be moistened by the wondrous path. Therefore there is the Circulation Division (*liútōng fēn* 流通分).**

[^116]: **後五百歲** (*hòu wǔbǎi suì*) — The "latter five hundred years," referring to the fifth of five five-hundred-year periods after the Buddha's passing, traditionally identified as the degenerate age (*mòfǎ* 末法). The Lotus Sutra's Circulation section ensures its transmission even in this difficult era.

---

### Teaching Classification of Each Division

**又示教相者，此序非為人天清升作序，非為二乘小道作序，不為即空通三作序，不為獨菩薩法作序，乃為正直捨方便、但說無上佛道作序耳。**

**Further indicating the teaching classification: This Sequence Division:**
- **is not** a preface for the pure elevation of humans and gods;
- **is not** a preface for the small path of the Two Vehicles;
- **is not** a preface for the "immediate emptiness" [teaching] shared among the three [vehicles];[^117]
- **is not** a preface for the solitary bodhisattva Dharma.[^118]
- **Rather**, it is a preface for directly discarding expedient means and solely proclaiming the supreme Buddha-path.

[^117]: **即空通三** (*jí kōng tōng sān*) — The Shared Teaching (通教 *Tōngjiào*), which teaches emptiness (*śūnyatā*) as accessible to śrāvakas, pratyekabuddhas, and bodhisattvas alike. Tiantai classifies it as provisional relative to the Perfect Teaching.

[^118]: **獨菩薩法** (*dú púsà fǎ*) — The Distinct Teaching (別教 *Biéjiào*), which presents a bodhisattva path separate from the Two Vehicles but still conceptually dualistic (positing stages, distinctions between cause and effect). Zhiyi excludes it here to emphasize the Lotus Sutra's exclusive commitment to the Perfect Teaching (圓教 *Yuánjiào*).

---

**此正不指世間為正，不指螢光析智為正，不指燈炬體法智為正，不指星月道種智為正，乃指日光一切種智為正。**

**This Main Division:**
- does **not** point to worldly [knowledge] as the main [teaching];
- does **not** point to firefly-light analytical wisdom (*xīzhì* 析智) as the main;
- does **not** point to lamp-and-torch Dharma-nature wisdom (*tǐfǎ zhì* 體法智) as the main;
- does **not** point to star-and-moonlight Path-Species Wisdom (*dào zhǒng zhì* 道種智) as the main;
- **rather**, it points to sunlight All-Knowledge (*yīqiè zhǒng zhì* 一切種智) as the main.[^119]**

[^119]: **The Four Wisdoms and Four Teachings:** Zhiyi distinguishes four levels of wisdom corresponding to the Four Teachings, using light metaphors to indicate their relative scope:

| Wisdom | Chinese | Sanskrit | Teaching | Metaphor | Characteristic |
|--------|---------|----------|----------|----------|----------------|
| Analytical Wisdom | 析智 *xīzhì* | — | Tripiṭaka 藏教 | Firefly | Analyzes phenomena into elements to realize emptiness |
| Dharma-nature Wisdom | 體法智 *tǐfǎ zhì* | — | Shared 通教 | Lamp/Torch | Directly contemplates empty nature without analysis |
| Path-Species Wisdom | 道種智 *dào zhǒng zhì* | *mārgajñatā* | Distinct 別教 | Star/Moon | Knows varieties of paths suited to different beings |
| All-Knowledge | 一切種智 *yīqiè zhǒng zhì* | *sarvajñatā* | Perfect 圓教 | Sun | Buddha's omniscient wisdom illuminating all without obstruction |

The Lotus Sutra's Main Division exclusively teaches the fourth wisdom (sunlight/Perfect Teaching).

---

**此流通非為楊葉木牛木馬而作流通，非流通半字，非流通共字，非流通別字，純是流通圓滿修多羅滿字法也。**

**This Circulation Division:**
- is **not** for circulating [mere toys like] poplar leaves,[^123] wooden oxen, and wooden horses;
- does **not** circulate the "half-word" [teaching];[^124]
- does **not** circulate the "shared-word" [teaching];
- does **not** circulate the "distinct-word" [teaching].
- **Purely**, it circulates the perfect sūtra's "full-word" Dharma.[^125]**

[^123]: **楊葉** (*yángyè*, poplar leaves) — Metaphor from the Lotus Sutra (Chapter 3, T.262.9.13a) for provisional teachings: the father offers "poplar leaves" as makeshift currency to entice children out of the burning house.

[^124]: **半字** (*bànzì*, "half-word") — Provisional, incomplete teachings (Tripiṭaka). Contrasted with 滿字 (*mǎnzì*, "full-word"), the complete teaching of the Lotus. This terminology derives from the *Mahāparinirvāṇa-sūtra* (T.374.12.633b).

[^125]: **圓滿修多羅滿字法** (*yuánmǎn xiūduōluó mǎnzì fǎ*) — The "perfect sūtra's full-word Dharma," i.e., the Lotus Sutra itself, which Tiantai regards as the sole complete revelation of the Buddha's intent.

---

### Trace/Original Structure Across Time

**次示本迹者，久遠行菩薩道時，宣揚先佛《法華經》，亦有三分上中下語，亦有本迹，但佛佛相望是則無窮。**

**Next, indicating Original and Trace: When [Śākyamuni] practiced the bodhisattva path in the distant past, he propagated the *Lotus Sutra* of previous Buddhas, which also had the threefold division of upper, middle, and lower discourse, and also had [the structure of] Original and Trace. However, if Buddhas are compared one to another, [this regress] is without end.**

---

**別取最初成佛時所說《法華》三分上中下語，專名為上，名之為本。何以故？最初成佛，初說法故，為上為本，此意可知。**

**[Therefore] we specifically take the *Lotus Sutra* with its threefold division of upper, middle, and lower discourse that was taught at the very first time [Śākyamuni] achieved Buddhahood, exclusively designating this as "upper" and naming it "Original." Why? Because it was the very first time he achieved Buddhahood and the first time he taught the Dharma, it is "upper" and "Original." This meaning is intelligible.**

---

**中間行化，助大通智勝、然燈等佛，宣揚《法華》三分者，但名為中，但名為迹。何以故？前有上故，前有本故。**

**[His] conduct of teaching in the middle periods — assisting Buddhas such as Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū (*Dàtōng Zhìshèng* 大通智勝)[^126] and Dīpaṃkara (*Rándēng* 然燈) in propagating the *Lotus Sutra* with its threefold division — is merely called "middle" and merely called "Trace." Why? Because there was an "upper" before it; there was an "Original" before it.**

[^126]: **大通智勝** (*Dàtōng Zhìshèng*, Skt. Mahābhijñājñānābhibhū) — The Buddha whose sixteen sons (including Śākyamuni in a previous life) taught the Lotus Sutra in the remote past, as recounted in Chapter 7 (*Parable of the Phantom City*). Dīpaṃkara (然燈) is the Buddha who gave Śākyamuni his prophecy of future Buddhahood.

---

**今日王城所說三分，但名為下，但名為迹，乃至師子奮迅之力，未來永永所說三分，亦指最初為上為本。**

**The threefold division taught today at the Royal City is merely called "lower" and merely called "Trace." Even [the threefold divisions] taught in the perpetual future by [the Buddha's] lion's vigorous power also point back to the very first [teaching] as "upper" and "Original."**

---

**譬如大樹雖有千枝萬葉，論其根本，不得傳傳相指同宗一根，此喻可解(云云)。**

**It is like a great tree: although it has a thousand branches and ten thousand leaves, when discussing its root and origin, one cannot trace "transmission after transmission" mutually pointing back — [ultimately] they share the same ancestry in one root. This metaphor is intelligible, and so forth.**

---


### Protocol Map: Fascicle 1 (Lines 112-140)
1. **Contemplation of Mind (Structure):** Applying the Threefold Division (Introduction, Main, Propagation) to internal cultivation (Sila, Samadhi, Prajna).

3. **The Two Introductions:** Distinction between General Introduction (Evam Mayā śrutam... to "sat to one side") and Specific Introduction.
4. **Explanation of "Thus" (Ru Shi):**
   - **General Definition:** Faith and compliance.

---

**[113] 次示觀心相者，當約己心論戒、定、慧為三分，修行以戒初、定中、慧後；**  
Next, to demonstrate the characteristics of the Contemplation of Mind: one should discuss the Precepts (*śīla*), Concentration (*samādhi*), and Wisdom (*prajñā*) regarding one's own mind as the Three Divisions. In cultivation, Precepts are the Beginning [Introduction], Concentration is the Middle [Main Body], and Wisdom is the End [Propagation].

**若法門以慧為本，定、戒為迹。**  
If discussing the Dharma-gate [in terms of doctrine], Wisdom is the fundamental basis (*ben*), while Concentration and Precepts are the traces (*ji*).

**又戒、定、慧各各作三分，前方便白四羯磨結竟，為戒三分；**  
Furthermore, Precepts, Concentration, and Wisdom can each be divided into three parts. The preliminary expedients [up to] the conclusion of the *jñapti-caturtha-karman* (white-four karma) constitute the Three Divisions of the Precepts.

**二十五方便正觀歷緣，又善入出住百千三昧等為定三分；**  
The Twenty-five Expedients, the Right Contemplation [practiced while] encountering conditions, and the skillful entering, exiting, and dwelling in hundreds of thousands of samadhis constitute the Three Divisions of Concentration.

**因緣所生法，即空、即假、即中為慧三分。**  
[The contemplation that] "Dharma arise from causes and conditions" [is Introduction]; "They are Empty, Provisional, and the Middle" constitutes the Three Divisions of Wisdom.

**[115] 已約三分示四種相，當用此義。**  
Having demonstrated the four kinds of characteristics [Causes & Conditions, Teachings, Origin/Trace, Contemplation] regarding the Three Divisions, one should employ this meaning.

**從「如是」去、至「作禮而退」已還，悉作四意消文。**  
From "Thus [have I heard]" (*evam*) through to "bowed and withdrew" at the end, one should interpret the text using all four meanings.

**但準望此義比知則易，分別顯示其辭則難，行者善思量之，語異意同，千車共轍、萬流醎會者也。**  
However, while it is easy to infer [the meaning] by careful comparison with this principle, it is difficult to explicitly manifest [all four meanings] in words. The practitioner should reflect on this well: though the words differ, the meaning is the same; "a thousand carts share the same rut," and "ten thousand streams all meet in the salty [ocean]."

**[117] ○序有通、別，從「如是」去、至「却坐一面」，通序也；從「爾時世尊」去、至品，別序也。**  
[Section: The Two Introductions]  
The Introduction has [two types]: General (*Tong*) and Specific (*Bie*). From "Thus [have I heard]" to "sat to one side" is the General Introduction. From "At that time the World Honored One" to the [end of the] chapter is the Specific Introduction.

**通序通諸教；別序別一經。通序為五或六或七(云云)。**  
The General Introduction is common to all teachings [sutras]; the Specific Introduction is specific to this one sutra. The General Introduction consists of five, six, or seven [elements] (etc.).[^127]

[^127]: **Five, Six, or Seven Elements**: Refers to the standard components of a sutra opening (Faith, Hearer, Time, Host, Place, Audience). Different commentators count them differently.

**[119] 「如是」者，舉所聞之法體。「我聞」者，能持之人也。「一時」者，聞持和合，非異時也。**  
"Thus" (*Evam*) indicates the essence of the Dharma that is heard. "I heard" (*Mayā śrutam*) indicates the person capable of upholding it. "At one time" (*Ekasmin samaye*) indicates the harmonious union of hearing and upholding, not a separate time.

**「佛」者，時從佛聞也。「王城耆山」，聞持之所也。「與大比丘」者，是聞持之伴也。此皆因緣和合，次第相[1]生。**  
"Buddha" indicates that at that time, it was heard from the Buddha. "The King's City, Vulture Peak" indicates the place of hearing and upholding. "With the Great Bhikshus" indicates the companions in hearing and upholding. These are all the harmonious union of causes and conditions, arising in sequential order.

**[123] 又「如是」者，三世佛經初皆安「如是」，諸佛道同不與世諍，世界悉檀也；**  
Furthermore, regarding "Thus" (*Ru Shi*): The beginning of the sutras of the Buddhas of the three times are all placed with "Thus." The Way of all Buddhas is the same, and they "do not dispute with the world." This is the Worldly Siddhānta.

**《大論》云：「舉時方令人生信者」，為人悉檀也；**  
The *Da Zhidu Lun* says: "Mentioning the time and place causes people to generate faith." This is the Siddhānta for Each Person.

**又對破外道阿[2]歐二字不如、不是，對治悉檀也；**  
Also, it is to refute the two words "A" and "Ou" of the non-Buddhists[^128], which are "Not-Thus" (*Bu Ru*) and "Not-Right" (*Bu Shi*). This is the Counteracting Siddhānta.

[^128]: **A and Ou**: Refers to the opening words of Brahmanical texts (A implying existence, Ou implying negation or auspiciousness), which Zhiyi contrasts with the Buddhist "Evam" (Thus).

**[3]又如是者，信順之辭，信則所聞之理會，順則師資之道成，即第一義悉檀也。因緣釋甚廣，不能具載(云云)。**  
Also, "Thus" is a word of faith and compliance. With faith, the principle that is heard is grasped; with compliance, the Way of teacher and disciple is established. This is the First Principle Siddhānta. The explanation via Causes and Conditions is very broad and cannot be fully recorded here (etc.).

**[128] 約教釋者，經稱三世佛法初皆如是，先佛有漸、頓、祕密、不定等經，漸又三藏、通、別、圓；今佛亦爾，諸經不同，如是亦異，不應一[4]匙開於眾戶。**  
[Interpretation via the Teachings:] The sutra states that the beginning of the Dharma of the Buddhas of the three times is always "Thus." But the past Buddhas had Gradual, Sudden, Secret, and Indeterminate sutras. The Gradual further divides into Tripitaka, Shared, Distinct, and Perfect. The present Buddha is also like this. Since the various sutras are different, their "Thus" is also different. One should not use a single key to open all doors.

**又佛、阿難二文不異為如，能詮詮所詮為是。今阿難傳佛何等文、詮何等是？**  
Furthermore, [the standard definition is that] the text of Ananda and the Buddha not being different is "Ru" (Like/As/Thus), and the signifier signifying the signified is "Shi" (Right/Correct/Thus). [But we must ask]: What kind of text is Ananda transmitting from the Buddha, and what kind of [truth] is he signifying?

**不可以漸文傳頓是、以偏文詮圓是，傳詮若謬則文不如，文不如則理不是。此義難明，須加意詳審。**  
One cannot use a Gradual text to transmit a Sudden "Right," nor use a Partial text to signify a Perfect "Right." If the transmission and signification are erroneous, the text is "Not-Thus" (*Bu Ru*), and if the text is not "Thus," the principle is "Not-Right" (*Bu Shi*). This meaning is difficult to clarify; one must apply the mind to examine it in detail.

**[132] 且依漸教分別，佛明俗有文字，真無文字。阿難傳佛俗諦文字，與佛說不異，故名如，因此俗文會真諦理，故名為是，此則三藏經初明如是也。**  
To categorize based on the Gradual Teaching: The Buddha explains that Conventional Truth has words/scripture, while Ultimate Truth has no words. Ananda transmits the words of the Buddha's Conventional Truth without difference from what the Buddha said, therefore it is named "Ru" (Like/As). Through this conventional text, one meets the principle of Ultimate Truth, therefore it is named "Shi" (Right). This clarifies the "Thus" (*Ru Shi*) at the beginning of the Tripitaka Sutras.

**佛明即色是空，空即是色，色空空色，無二無別，空色不異為如，即事而真為是。**  
[For the Shared Teaching:] The Buddha explains that Form *is* Emptiness, Emptiness *is* Form. Form and Emptiness, Emptiness and Form, are without duality or distinction. The non-difference of Emptiness and Form is "Ru" (Like). Being Ultimate right within phenomena (*Ji Shi Er Zhen*) is "Shi" (Right).

**阿難傳佛文不異為如，能詮即所詮為是，此則通教經初如是也。**  
Ananda transmitting the Buddha's text without difference is "Ru"; the signifier *being* the signified is "Shi". This is the "Thus" at the beginning of the Shared Teaching Sutras.

**佛明生死是有邊，涅槃是無邊，出生死有邊，入涅槃無邊，出涅槃無邊，入於中道。**  
[For the Distinct Teaching:] The Buddha explains that Birth-and-Death is the side of existence (*bhava*); Nirvana is the side of non-existence (*abhava*). One exits the side of Birth-and-Death existence and enters the non-existence of Nirvana; one exits the non-existence of Nirvana and enters the Middle Way.

**阿難傳此出有入無，出無入中，與佛說無異為如，從淺至深，無非曰是，此則別教經初如是也。**  
Ananda transmitting this exiting existence to enter non-existence, and exiting non-existence to enter the Middle, without difference from the Buddha's speech, is "Ru". From the shallow to the deep, nothing is not "Shi". This is the "Thus" at the beginning of the Distinct Teaching Sutras.

**佛明生死即涅槃，亦即中道，況復涅槃寧非中道？真如法界實性實際，徧一切處無非佛法。**  
[For the Perfect Teaching:] The Buddha explains that Birth-and-Death *is* Nirvana, and also *is* the Middle Way. How much more so is Nirvana—how could it not be the Middle Way? True Suchness (*tathatā*), the Dharma Realm, Real Nature, and Reality Limit—pervading all places, there is nothing that is not the Buddha Dharma.

**阿難傳此，與佛說無異，故名為如，如如不動故名為是，是則[5]圓經初如是也。**  
Ananda transmitting this without difference from the Buddha's speech is named "Ru". Being immovable in Thusness-Thusness (*Ru Ru*) is named "Shi". This is the "Thus" at the beginning of the Perfect Teaching Sutras.

**若動俗入如，三藏義耳；不動俗即是如，通教義耳；動如入如，別教義耳；不動如而[6]是如，圓教義也(云云)。**
If one "moves" [destroys] the Conventional to enter Thusness, this is the meaning of the Tripitaka. If the Conventional, immovable [without destruction], *is* Thusness, this is the meaning of the Shared Teaching. If one "moves" [cultivates] Thusness to enter Thusness [deeper realization], this is the meaning of the Distinct Teaching. If one does not move from Thusness yet *is* Thusness, this is the meaning of the Perfect Teaching.[^130]

[^130]: **動俗入如 Schema — The Definitive Tiantai Classification**: This passage (動俗入如, "moving conventional to enter thusness") is THE canonical formula distinguishing the Four Gradual Teachings in Tiantai doctrine. **Tripiṭaka** (藏): Destroys conventional truth (俗諦) as false to reach ultimate truth—dualistic negation. **Shared** (通): Conventional truth *is* emptiness without needing destruction—non-dual realization, but still privileges emptiness. **Distinct** (別): Progressively transforms provisional truth (假) into deeper levels of realization—gradual ascent through stages. **Perfect** (圓): Thusness is never departed from; conventional and ultimate are simultaneous—the Lotus Sutra's "opening the provisional to reveal the real" (開權顯實). This is not merely one among many classifications but Zhiyi's razor for diagnosing the ultimate capacity (*jiào pàn* 教判) of any Buddhist teaching.

**若頓如是與圓同，不定如是前後更互，祕密者隱而不傳。**  
As for the "Thus" of the Sudden [Teaching], it is the same as the Perfect. The "Thus" of the Indeterminate alternates back and forth. The Secret is hidden and not transmitted.

**敷八教網亘法界海，懼其有漏，況羅之一目若為獨張？又一時接四箭，不令墮地，未敢稱捷；策鈍驢、驅跛鼈尚不得一，何況四耶(云云)？**  
Spreading the net of the Eight Teachings across the ocean of the Dharma Realm, we still fear leaking [missing beings]. How much more so if we only spread a single mesh of the net? Furthermore, [an archer] catching four arrows at once without letting them hit the ground—I dare not claim victory [in understanding "Thus"]. If one whips a dull donkey or drives a lame turtle, one cannot even catch one [meaning], how much less four?

**[137] 約本迹釋如是者，三世十方橫豎皆爾，過去遠遠，現在漫漫，未來永永，皆悉如是，何處是本？何處是迹？**  
[Interpretation via Origin and Trace:] Regarding interpreting "Thus" via Origin (*Ben*) and Trace (*Ji*): The three times and ten directions, horizontally and vertically, are all like this. The past is distant, the present is vast, the future is eternal—all are "Thus." Where is the Origin? Where is the Trace?

**且約釋尊最初成道，經初如是者，是本也；中間作佛說經，今日所說經初如是者，皆迹也。**  
If we refer to the World Honored One's Initial Attainment of the Way, the "Thus" at the beginning of [that] sutra is the Origin. The sutras spoken while appearing as a Buddha in the intermediate times, and the "Thus" at the beginning of the sutra spoken today, are all Traces.

**又阿難所傳如是者迹也，佛所說如是者本也。又師弟通達如是，非始今日、亦非中間者，本也；而中間而今日者，迹也。**  
Furthermore, the "Thus" transmitted by Ananda is the Trace; the "Thus" spoken by the Buddha is the Origin. Also, the "Thus" that teacher and disciple penetrate—which did not begin today nor in the intermediate time—is the Origin; whereas the intermediate and today [manifestation] is the Trace.

**[139] 觀心釋者，觀前悉檀教[7]迹等諸如是義，悉是因緣生法，即通觀也；因緣即空即假者，別觀也；二觀為方便道，得入中道第一義，雙照二諦者，亦通亦別觀也；上來悉是中道者，非通非別觀也。**  
[Interpretation via Contemplation of Mind:] Contemplating the aforementioned meanings of "Thus" regarding Siddhāntas, Teachings, and Traces:
- Seeing them all as "Dharma arising from causes and conditions" is the Shared Contemplation (*Tong Guan*).
- Seeing "Causes and conditions are Empty and Provisional" is the Distinct Contemplation (*Bie Guan*).
- Using these two contemplations as expedient paths to enter the Middle Way First Principle, doubly illuminating the Two Truths, is [a function of] both Shared and Distinct Contemplation.
- Seeing that all the above are the Middle Way is the Contemplation that is neither Shared nor Distinct [i.e., Perfect Contemplation].

**下文云：「若人信汝所說，即[8]得見我亦見於汝及比丘僧并諸菩薩。」即觀行之明文也。**  
The text below says: "If a person believes what you say, they will immediately see Me, and also see you, the Bhikshu Sangha, and the Bodhisattvas." This is a clear passage regarding Contemplation Practice.

**信則論機，見則是應，即因緣也。又信有淺深、見有權實，種種分別不同者，即分別教。**  
"Faith" discusses the Capacity (Ji); "Seeing" is the Response (Ying). This is [Contemplation of] Causes and Conditions. Furthermore, Faith has shallow and deep; Seeing has Provisional and Real. The various distinctions and differences are the [Contemplation of] Teachings.

**又[9]信《法華》之文，則見實相之本，若見身子之化，則見龍陀之本；若見始成釋尊，亦見久成先佛；若見千二百比丘、八萬菩薩者，亦見其本也。**  
Furthermore, if one believes in the text of the *Lotus*, one sees the Origin of Real Form. If one sees the transformation body of Śāriputra (*Shēnzǐ* 身子), one sees the Origin of Golden Dragon Intelligence (*Jīn Lóngtuó* 金龍陀).[^129] If one sees the Shakyamuni who "newly attained" [enlightenment], one also sees the Ancient Buddha who attained long ago. If one sees the 1,200 Bhikshus and 80,000 Bodhisattvas, one also sees their Origin.

[^129]: **Golden Dragon Intelligence** (*Jīn Lóngtuó* 金龍陀): Śāriputra's Buddha-name in his Original Nature (*ben* 本). According to the Origin/Trace doctrine, Śāriputra appears as a disciple in the Trace manifestation, but in his fundamental identity (Origin), he is the Buddha "Golden Dragon Intelligence." This exemplifies the Lotus Sutra's teaching that the śrāvakas are not ultimately disciples but Buddhas. Source: T.1718 Fahua Wenju, Fascicle 5, Line 98: "身子久成佛，號金龍陀" ("Śāriputra long ago became a Buddha; his name was Golden Dragon Intelligence").

**又聞經心信無疑，覺此信心明淨，即是見佛；慧數分明，是見身子；諸數分明，[10]是眾比丘；慈悲心淨，是見諸菩薩。**  
Also, hearing the Sutra and believing with no doubt in the mind: being aware that this believing mind is bright and pure—this is "Seeing the Buddha." The mental factor (*caitta*) of Wisdom being clear—this is "Seeing Sariputra." The various [other] mental factors being clear—this is "Seeing the Assembly of Bhikshus." The mind of kindness and compassion being pure—this is "Seeing the Bodhisattvas."

**約心為四帖釋轉明，若釋他經但用三意，為未發本顯迹故。當知今經三釋與他同，一釋與彼異，四番釋如是竟(云云)。**  
Interpreting via the Mind makes the previous four layers [of interpretation] progressively clearer. If interpreting other sutras, one only uses three meanings [Causes/Conditions, Teachings, Contemplation?], because they have no "Opened the Origin to Reveal the Trace." One should know that for this Sutra, three interpretations are the same as others, but one interpretation [Origin/Trace] is different. The fourfold explanation of "Thus" is concluded.

**[146] 「我聞」者，或「聞如是」，蓋經本不同，前後互舉耳。**  
Regarding "I Heard" (*Wo Wen*): Sometimes it is [phrased] "Heard Thus" (*Wen Ru Shi*). This is because the sutra versions differ, bringing up [the terms] in alternating order.

**今例為四釋，《大論》云：「耳根不壞聲在可聞處，作心欲聞，眾緣和合，故言我聞。」**  
Now, following the precedent, we make four interpretations. The *Da Zhidu Lun* says: "The ear faculty is not damaged, sound is in the range of audibility, and the mind generates the desire to hear. Because this multitude of conditions harmoniously unites, one says 'I heard'."

**[148] 問：應言耳聞，那云我聞？**  
Question: One should say "the ear hears"; why say "I heard"?

**[152] 答：我是[1]耳主，舉我攝眾緣。此世界釋也。**  
Answer: "I" is the master of the ear. Mentioning "I" encompasses the multitude of conditions. This is the Worldly Explanation.

**阿難登[2]高稱我聞，大眾應悲號，適見如來今稱我聞，無學飛騰說偈。**  
When Ananda ascended the high [seat] and proclaimed "I heard," the great assembly responded with weeping and wailing. Just as they saw the Tathagata [in the past], now [hearing Ananda] proclaim "I heard," the No-Learners (*Aśaikṣa*) flew up and spoke verses.

**《佛話經》明文殊結集，先唱題、次稱如是我聞，時眾悲號。此為人釋也。**  
The *Fo Hua Jing* explains that when Manjushri compiled [the sutras], he first chanted the title, then proclaimed "Thus I heard," and the assembly at that time wept and wailed. This is the Explanation for Each Person.

**阿難登高稱我聞遣眾疑，阿難身與佛相似，短佛三[3]指，眾疑釋尊重出，或他方佛來，或阿難成佛；若唱我聞，三疑即遣。此對治釋也。**  
[When] Ananda ascended the high [seat] and proclaimed "I heard," it dispelled the doubts of the assembly. Ananda's body was similar to the Buddha's, short of the Buddha by [only] three finger-widths. The assembly doubted: "Has Shakyamuni reappeared?" "Has a Buddha from another region come?" or "Has Ananda become a Buddha?" If he chants "I heard" [implying he is a disciple hearing a master], the Three Doubts[^131] are immediately dispelled. This is the Counteracting Explanation.

[^131]: **Three Doubts** (*sān yí*): The doubts that arose in the assembly when Ananda assumed the lion seat to recite the sutras after the Buddha's Parinirvana: 1. Did Shakyamuni return to life? 2. Is this a Buddha from another world? 3. Did Ananda himself achieve Buddhahood? The phrase "I heard" clarifies his disciple status.

**阿難學人，隨俗稱我聞，第一義中無我無聞，古來眾釋同是因緣一意耳。**  
Ananda is a Learner (*Śaikṣa*). He complies with the worldly [convention] to proclaim "I heard," [but] in the First Principle there is no "I" and no "hearing." The many interpretations since ancient times are all identical to this single meaning of Causes and Conditions.

**[160] 約教解釋者，《釋論》云：「凡夫三種我，謂見、慢、名字，學人二種，無學一種。」**  
Interpreting via the Teachings: The *Treatise on Explaining* (*Shi Lun*) says: "Ordinary people have three kinds of 'I': [the 'I' of] Views (*dṛṣṭi*), Conceit (*māna*), and Names/Concepts. Learners have two. No-Learners have one."

**阿難是學人，無[4]邪我、能伏慢我，隨世名字稱我無咎，此用三藏意釋我也。**  
Ananda is a Learner. He lacks the Evil "I" [of Views], is able to subdue the Conceit "I," and complies with the worldly Name "I" without fault. This uses the meaning of the Tripitaka [Teaching] to interpret "I."

**《十住毘婆沙》云：「四句稱我皆墮邪見，佛正法中無我，誰聞？」此用通教意也。**  
The *Daśabhūmika-vibhāṣā* says: "Proclaiming 'I' in four phrases [is it existent, non-existent, etc.] all falls into evil views. In the Buddha's Correct Dharma there is no 'I.' Who hears?" This uses the meaning of the Shared Teaching.

**《大經》云：「阿難多聞士，知我無我而不二，雙分別我、無我。」此用別教意也。**  
The *Great Sutra* (*Nirvana Sutra*) says: "Ananda is a scholar of great learning (*bahu-śruta*). He knows 'I' and 'No-I' are non-dual, yet doubly distinguishes 'I' and 'No-I'." This uses the meaning of the Distinct Teaching.

**又阿難知我無我而不二，方便為侍者，傳持如來無礙智慧，以自在音聲傳權傳實，有何不可？此用圓教釋我也。**  
Moreover, Ananda knows 'I' and 'No-I' are non-dual. As an expedient he acts as an attendant, transmitting and upholding the Tathagata's unhindered wisdom. Using sovereign sounds to transmit the Provisional and transmit the Real—what is impermissible [about saying 'I']? This uses the Perfect Teaching to interpret "I."

**又《正法念經》，明三阿難：阿[5]難陀此云歡喜，持小乘藏；阿難跋陀此云歡喜賢，受持雜藏；阿難[6]娑伽此云歡喜海，持佛藏。**  
Furthermore, the *Zhengfa Nian Jing* (*Saddharmasmṛtyupasthāna Sūtra*) clarifies "Three Anandas":
1.  **Ananda** (Joy): Upholds the Hinayana Pitaka.
2.  **Ananda-Bhadra** (Joy Sage): Upholds the Miscellaneous Pitaka.
3.  **Ananda-Sagara** (Joy Sea): Upholds the Buddha Pitaka.

**《阿含經》有典藏阿難，持菩薩藏。蓋指一人具於四德，傳持四法門，其義自顯(云云)。**  
The *Agama Sutra* mentions a "Store-Keeper Ananda" (*Gocarānanda*?) who upholds the Bodhisattva Pitaka. This implies that one person possesses four virtues and transmits/upholds four Dharma-gates; the meaning is self-evident.

**[166] 本迹釋者，若未會入，可言阿難隨世名我；若發迹顯本，空王佛所同時發心，方便示為傳法之人，何所不[7]能？**  
[Interpretation via Origin and Trace:] If one has not yet merged and entered [the Perfect understanding], one can say Ananda follows the worldly name "I." If one Opens the Trace to Reveal the Origin: at the place of Empty King Buddha (*Śūnyatā-rāja*), he prompted the mind [of Bodhicitta] at the same time [as Shakyamuni]. As an expedient he manifests as the person who transmits the Dharma. What is he not capable of?[^132]

[^132]: **Empty King Buddha** (*Kōng Wáng Fó*): A past Buddha mentioned in the *Lotus Sutra* (Chapter 9, "Prophecies Conferred upon Learners and Adepts") at whose assembly both Shakyamuni and Ananda made their initial vows together. The text states Ananda "delighted in much learning" (*duō wén*) while Shakyamuni "delighted in diligent practice" (*jīng jìn*), establishing their respective roles as attendant-disciple and teacher. Their simultaneous origin (同時發心) under Empty King Buddha demonstrates that Ananda's "trace" role as learner is provisional; his fundamental capacity equals the Buddha's.

**[170] 觀心釋者，觀因緣所生法，即空、即假、即中，即空者我無我也，即假者分別我也，即中者真妙我也(云云)。**  
[Interpretation via Contemplation of Mind:] Contemplating the dharma arising from causes and conditions: it is Empty, it is Provisional, it is the Middle.
-   **Is Empty**: "I" is No-I.
-   **Is Provisional**: Distinguishing "I."
-   **Is Middle**: The True Wonderful "I."

---

**[172] 釋「聞」者，阿難，佛得道夜生，侍佛二十餘年，未侍佛時應是不聞。**  
Explaining "Heard" (*Wen*): Ananda was born on the night the Buddha attained the Way. He served the Buddha for twenty-odd years. [Thus], regarding the time before he served the Buddha, he should not have heard [those teachings].

**《大論》云：「阿難集法時自云：『佛初轉法輪，我爾時不見，如是展轉聞。』」當知不悉聞也。**  
The *Da Zhidu Lun* says: "When Ananda was compiling the Dharma, he himself said: 'When the Buddha first turned the Dharma Wheel, I did not see it at that time; I heard it through successive transmission (*paramparā*).'" One should know [from this] that he did not hear everything [personally].

**舊解云：「阿難得佛覺三昧，力自能聞。」《報恩經》云：「阿難求四願，所未聞經願佛重說。」**
An old interpretation says: "Ananda attained the Buddha-Awakening Samadhi (*fó jué sānmèi* 佛覺三昧),[^134] and by its power he was able to hear [teachings from before his time] naturally." The *Bao'en Jing* (*Sutra of Gratitude*) says: "Ananda requested four vows; regarding the sutras he had not heard, he vowed that the Buddha would repeat them."

[^134]: **佛覺三昧** (*fó jué sānmèi*, "Buddha-Awakening Samadhi") — Not to be confused with *Buddhānusmṛti-samādhi* (念佛三昧, "Buddha-Recollection Samadhi"). This term appears to designate a unique meditative state in which Ananda could retroactively receive teachings preached before he began serving the Buddha. The precise doctrinal classification of this samadhi is unclear in the commentarial tradition; Zhiyi presents it as an "old interpretation" (舊解) which he balances against other explanations.

**又云：「佛口密為說也。」《胎經》云：「佛從金棺出金臂，重為阿難現入胎之相，諸經皆聞。」**  
It also says: "The Buddha spoke for him through the secret [power] of his mouth." The *Tai Jing* (*Garbha Sutra*) says: "The Buddha extended his golden arm from the golden coffin and again manifested the marks of entering the womb for Ananda; he heard all the sutras."

**況餘處說耶？此文云：「阿難得記，即憶本願，持先佛法皆如今也。」此因緣釋也。**  
How much more so for what was preached in other places? This text [the *Lotus Sutra*] says: "When Ananda received his prophecy, he immediately recollected his original vows and upheld the Dharma of past Buddhas just as he does today." This is the interpretation via Causes and Conditions.

**[174] 若約教者，歡喜阿難，面如淨滿月，眼若青蓮華，親承佛旨如仰完器，傳以化人如瀉異瓶，此傳聞、聞法也。**  
If distinguishing via the Teachings: "Joy Ananda" (*Ānanda* - Tripitaka) has a face like the pure full moon and eyes like blue lotus flowers. He personally received the Buddha's decree like an upright bowl [receiving water], and transmitted it to transform people like pouring into another vessel. This is transmitting the "Heard" and "Hearing the Dharma" (*hearing teachings with sounds/words*).

**歡喜賢，住學地得空無相願，眼、耳、鼻、舌諸根不漏，傳持聞不聞法也。**
"Joy Sage" (*Huānxǐ Xián* 歡喜賢 - Shared)[^135] dwells in the stage of learning and attains Emptiness, Signlessness, and Wishlessness. His eyes, ears, nose, tongue, and other faculties do not leak [defilements]. He transmits and upholds the "Hearing of Non-Hearing" Dharma (*hearing the truth of emptiness within words*).

[^135]: **歡喜賢 Ananda** (*Huānxǐ Xián*, "Joy-Sage" or "Joy-Worthy") — The second of the Four Anandas, corresponding to the Shared Teaching. Unlike "Joy Ananda" (歡喜阿難) of the Tripitaka Teaching who transmits verbal teachings, "Joy-Sage" has attained the Stage of Learning (學地) and realizes the Three Liberations (空無相願); thus he transmits the Dharma of "Hearing Non-Hearing" (聞不聞法)—perceiving the truth of emptiness within the conventional words. This classification is unique to Tiantai hermeneutics and does not appear in earlier Indian sources.

**典藏阿難多所含受，如大雲持雨，此傳持不聞聞法也。**
"Store-Keeper Ananda" (*Diǎnzàng Ānán* 典藏阿難 - Distinct)[^136] contains and accepts much, like a great cloud holding rain. He transmits and upholds the "Non-Hearing of Hearing" Dharma (*perceiving the provisional existence within the empty nature*).

[^136]: **典藏阿難** (*Diǎnzàng Ānán*, "Store-Keeper Ananda") — The third of the Four Anandas, corresponding to the Distinct Teaching. He "contains and accepts much, like a great cloud holding rain" (多所含受，如大雲持雨), transmitting the Dharma of "Non-Hearing of Hearing" (不聞聞法)—perceiving the provisional existence (假) within the nature of emptiness. The "Store-Keeper" epithet alludes to his role as custodian of the Treasury of Teachings (藏), preserving the full spectrum of skillful means.

**阿難海，是多聞士，自然能解了是常與無常，若知如來常不說法，是名菩薩具足多聞，佛法大海水，流入阿難心，此傳持不聞不聞法也。**  
"Ananda Ocean" (*Ānanda-Sāgara* - Perfect) is the Scholar of Great Learning (*Bahu-śruta*). He naturally understands both Permanence and Impermanence. If one knows that the Tathagata eternally does not speak the Dharma, this is named "Bodhisattva replete with much learning." The great ocean water of the Buddha Dharma flows into Ananda's heart. He transmits and upholds the "Non-Hearing of Non-Hearing" Dharma (*the Middle Way beyond sound and silence*).

**今經是海阿難，持不聞不聞之妙法也。**  
The present sutra [is upheld by] "Ocean Ananda," who holds the subtle Dharma of "Non-Hearing of Non-Hearing."

**[176] 本迹解者，如上四聞皆迹引，而本地不可思議(云云)。**  
[Interpretation via Origin and Trace:] The four kinds of "Hearing" above are all traces [used to] lead [beings]. The Origin Stage (*Ben Di*) is inconceivable (etc.).

**[178] 觀心釋者，觀因緣法是觀聞聞，觀空是觀聞不聞，觀假是觀不聞聞，觀中是觀不聞不聞(云云)。一念觀者，妙觀也(云云)。**  
[Contemplation of Mind:]
- Contemplating the Dharma of causes and conditions is contemplating "Hearing the Hearing."
- Contemplating Emptiness is contemplating "Hearing Non-Hearing."
- Contemplating the Provisional is contemplating "Non-Hearing Hearing."
- Contemplating the Middle is contemplating "Non-Hearing Non-Hearing."
- Contemplating in a single thought-moment is the Subtle Contemplation.

**[180] 「一時」者，肇師云：「法王啟運嘉會之時」者，世界也。**  
Regarding "At One Time" (*Ekasmin samaye*): Master [Seng]zhao says: "The time when the Dharma King initiates the movement [of the teaching] and the fine assembly gathers." This is the Worldly [Interpretation].

**論云：「迦羅是實時」，示內弟子時；食時著衣者，為人也。**
The *Treatise* (*Da Zhidu Lun*) says: "*Kāla* is real time," indicating the time for inner disciples; "Meal time, putting on robes" is for [generating faith in] Each Person.[^137]

**「三摩耶是假時」，[8]破外道邪見者，對治也。**
"*Samaya* is provisional time" [is used to] refute the evil views of non-Buddhists [who claim eternal time]. This is the Counteracting [Interpretation].

[^137]: **Kāla vs. Samaya** — The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* (大智度論, T.1509.25.60a) distinguishes two Sanskrit terms for "time": *kāla* (迦羅, "real/absolute time") refers to the cosmological succession of kalpas and the monastic daily schedule ("meal time, putting on robes"), accessible to ordinary perception and suitable for generating faith (為人悉檀). *Samaya* (三摩耶, "provisional/agreed-upon time") indicates the conventional designation of temporal moments, used to refute non-Buddhist (Tīrthika) claims that time itself is an eternal, independent entity (對治悉檀). When time "unites with the Way" (時與道合), transcending both categories, it becomes the First Principle (第一義).

**若時與道合者，第一義也(云云)。**  
If the Time unites with the Way, this is the First Principle (etc.).

**若見諦已上、無學已下，名下一時；若三人同入第一義，名中一時；若登地已上，名上一時；若初住已上，名上上一時。今經是上上一時，此約教分別也。**  
- If [referring to] those from the Stage of Verification (*Darśana-mārga*) up to No-Learners (*Aśaikṣa*), it is named "Lower One Time" [Tripitaka].
- If the Three People [Śrāvaka, Pratyekabuddha, Bodhisattva] enter the First Principle together, it is named "Middle One Time" [Shared].
- If [referring to] those from the Ground Stages (*Bhūmi*) upwards, it is named "Upper One Time" [Distinct].
- If [referring to] those from the First Abode (*Prathamā-vihāra*) upwards, it is named "Upper-Upper One Time" [Perfect].
- The present sutra is the "Upper-Upper One Time." This is the underlying distinction via the Teachings.

**[184] 本迹者，前諸一時，迹也；久遠實得之一時，本也。**  
[Origin and Trace:] The aforementioned "One Times" differ; they are Traces. The "One Time" of the actual attainment in the remote past is the Origin.

**[186] 觀心釋者，觀心先空、次假、後中，次第觀心也。觀心即空、即假、即中者，圓妙觀心也。**  
[Contemplation of Mind:] Contemplating the mind first as Empty, next as Provisional, and afterwards as Middle is specific/sequential contemplation. Contemplating the mind as *simultaneously* Empty, Provisional, and Middle is the Perfect Subtle Contemplation.

**[188] 「佛」者，劫初無病，劫盡多病；長壽時樂，短壽時苦。東天下富而[9]壽，西天下多珠寶多牛羊，北天下無我、無臣屬，如此時處不感佛出。**  
Regarding "Buddha" (*Fo*): At the beginning of the kalpa there is no sickness; at the end of the kalpa there is much sickness. In times of long life there is joy; in times of short life there is suffering. The Eastern Continent is rich and long-lived; the Western Continent has many jewels, cattle, and sheep; the Northern Continent has no "I" [ownership] and no subjects/retainers. In time and places like these, there is no stimulus (*gan*) for a Buddha to appear.

**八萬歲時百年時，南天下未見果而修因，故佛出其地。**  
In the time of [human lifespan] 80,000 years, or the time of 100 years, in the Southern Continent [Jambudvipa], where people do not [yet] see the fruit but cultivate the cause, the Buddha appears in that land.

**離車子云：「摩竭[10]提國如大池，佛出其國如大蓮華。」無勝云：「佛於眾生平等無二，汝等耽荒五欲不見佛耳，非佛棄汝出摩竭提。」此皆世界釋也。**
The Licchavi son said: "The Kingdom of Magadha is like a great pond; the Buddha appearing in that kingdom is like a huge lotus flower." Invincible (*Wú Shèng* 無勝)[^138] said: "The Buddha is equal and non-dual regarding sentient beings; it is just that you are indulgent and dissolute in the five desires and do not see the Buddha; it is not that the Buddha abandoned you to appear in Magadha." These are all Worldly Interpretations.

[^138]: **無勝** (*Wú Shèng*, "Invincible" or "Unsurpassed") — Identity uncertain. Possibly a Licchavi elder or lay disciple from Vaiśālī, offering a complementary teaching to the "Licchavi son" (離車子) mentioned immediately prior. The passage emphasizes that the Buddha's appearance is determined by beings' capacity (機), not arbitrary geographic favoritism.

**日若不出，池中未生、生已等華，翳死無疑；佛若出世則有剎利、婆羅門、居士、四天王乃至有頂，此就為人釋也。**  
If the sun did not rise, the flowers in the pond—whether not yet born or already born—would undoubtedly wither and die. If the Buddha appears in the world, then there are Kshatriyas, Brahmins, Householders, the Four Heavenly Kings, up to the Akanistha Heaven [who flourish]. This is the interpretation for Each Person.

**三乘根性感佛出世，餘不能感，善斷有頂種，永度生死流，此就對治說也。**  
Those with roots/capacities of the Three Vehicles stimulate the Buddha to appear in the world; others cannot stimulate him. He skillfully cuts off the seeds of the Akanistha [highest samsaric existence] and eternally crosses the stream of birth and death. This is spoken regarding Counteracting.

**佛於法性，無動、無出，能令眾生感見動出，而於如來實無動出，此就第一義說也。皆因緣釋耳。**  
Regarding the Dharma-Nature, the Buddha has no movement and no appearing. [Yet] he is able to cause sentient beings to stimulate/perceive movement and appearing, while in the Tathagata there is truly no movement or appearing. This is spoken regarding the First Principle. These are all the interpretations via Causes and Conditions.

**[193] 佛名覺者、知者，於道場樹下，知覺世間、出世間，總相、別相，覺世即苦、集，覺出世即道、滅；亦能覺他。身長丈六，壽八十，老比丘像。菩提樹下三十四心正、習俱盡者，即三藏佛自覺覺他。**  
"Buddha" is named the Awakened One, the Knower. Under the Tree at the Bodhimanda, he knew and awakened to the worldly and supramundane, the general characteristics and specific characteristics. He awakened that the worldly *is* Suffering and Accumulation; he awakened that the supramundane *is* the Path and Extinction. He is also able to awaken others. His body is sixteen feet tall; his lifespan is eighty years; he has the image of an old Bhikshu. Under the Bodhi Tree, with thirty-four thought-moments, he completely exhausted correct [afflictions] and residual habits. This is the Tripitaka Buddha awakening self and awakening others.

**帶比丘像現尊特身，樹下一念相應，斷餘殘習者，即通佛自覺覺他。**  
Manifesting the Superior Special Body (*Zūn Tè Shēn*) while wearing the image of a Bhikshu; corresponding in a single thought under the tree to cut off the remaining residual habits—this is the Shared Buddha awakening self and awakening others.

**單現尊特相，坐蓮花臺受佛職者，即別佛自覺覺他。**  
Simply manifesting the Superior Special Characteristics, sitting on a lotus flower pedestal to receive the Buddha-office—this is the Distinct Buddha awakening self and awakening others.

**隱前三相，唯示不可思議如虛空相，即圓佛自覺覺他。**  
Hiding the previous three characteristics and only manifesting the inconceivable characteristic like empty space—this is the Perfect Buddha awakening self and awakening others.

**故經云：「或見如來丈六之身，或見小身、大身，或見坐花臺為百千釋迦說心地法門，或見身同虛空遍於法界無有分別。」即此義也。是為約教分別也。**  
Therefore the Sutra says: "Some see the Tathagata's sixteen-foot body. Some see a small body or large body. Some see him sitting on a flower pedestal preaching the Mind-Ground Dharma Gate for a hundred thousand Shakyamunis. Some see a body like empty space, pervading the Dharma Realm without distinction." This is precisely this meaning. This is the distinction via the Teachings.

**[195] 本迹釋者，一佛為本，三佛為迹，中間示現數數唱生、數數唱滅，皆是迹也；唯本地四佛皆是本也。**  
[Origin and Trace:] The One [Eternal] Buddha is the Origin; the three [provisional] Buddhas are Traces. The intermediate manifestations, repeatedly proclaiming birth and repeatedly proclaiming extinction, are all Traces. Only the four Buddhas of the Origin Stage (*Ben Di*) are the Origin.[^133]

[^133]: **Four Buddhas of the Origin Stage**: Refers to the four aspects of the Eternal Buddha in the "Lifespan" chapter (Tathagata's secret mystic powers), corresponding to the four teachings but at the level of the original enlightenment.

**[197] 觀心釋者，觀因緣所生心，先空、次假、後中，皆偏覺也；觀心即空、即假、即中，是圓覺也(云云)。**  
[Contemplation of Mind:] Contemplating the mind arising from causes and conditions: first Empty, next Provisional, after Middle—these are all Partial Awakening. Contemplating the mind as *simultaneously* Empty, Provisional, and Middle—this is Perfect Awakening.

**[199] 「住」者，能[1]住住所住，所住即是忍土王城，能住即是四威儀，住世未滅，此則世界因緣釋住也。**  
Regarding "Dwelling" (*Zhu*): The Subject (*Neng*) Dwells in the Place (*Suo*) Dwelt. The Place Dwelt is the Royal City in the Saha World (*Ren Tu*, Land of Endurance). The Subject Dwelling is the Four Dignified Deptortments [walking, standing, sitting, lying], dwelling in the world without yet being extinct. This is the interpretation of Dwelling via Worldly Causes and Conditions.

**又住者，住十善道、住四禪中，此即為人因緣釋住也。**  
Also, "Dwelling": Dwelling in the Ten Good Paths, dwelling in the Four Dhyanas. This is the interpretation of Dwelling via Causes and Conditions for Each Person.

**又住者，住三三昧，對治因緣釋住。又住者，住首楞嚴，即是第一義因緣釋住(云云)。**  
Also, "Dwelling": Dwelling in the Three Samadhis. This is the interpretation of Dwelling via Counteracting Causes and Conditions. Also, "Dwelling": Dwelling in the *Śūraṅgama* [Samadhi]. This is the interpretation of Dwelling via First Principle Causes and Conditions.

**[203] 約教者，三藏佛從析門發真無漏，住有餘、無餘涅槃。通佛從體門發真，住有餘、無餘涅槃。別佛從次第門入，住祕密藏。圓佛從不次第門入，住祕密藏。**  
Interpretation via the Teachings:
- The **Tripitaka Buddha** initiates the True No-Outflow [Wisdom] via the Gate of Analysis (*xi men*) and dwells in Nirvana With Remainder and Without Remainder.
- The **Shared Buddha** initiates the True via the Gate of Embodiment (*ti men*) and dwells in Nirvana With Remainder and Without Remainder.
- The **Distinct Buddha** enters via the Gradual Gate (*ci di men*) and dwells in the Secret Store.
- The **Perfect Buddha** enters via the Non-Gradual Gate (*bu ci di men*) and dwells in the Secret Store.

**前三佛住，能所皆麁；後一佛住，能所俱妙。今經則是圓佛住於妙住也。**  
For the first three Buddhas, both the Subject [who dwells] and the Object [dwelt in] are coarse. For the latter one Buddha, both Subject and Object are subtle. The present Sutra is the Perfect Buddha dwelling in the Subtle Abode.

**[205] 本迹解者，三藏佛[2]應涅槃，慈悲垂迹生身住世。通佛誓願慈悲，扶餘習度眾生作佛事。**  
[Interpretation via Origin and Trace:]
- The Tripitaka Buddha applies himself to Nirvana; out of kindness and compassion he manifests the Trace of a "born body" to dwell in the world.
- The Shared Buddha, through vows of kindness and compassion, supports his remaining habits (*vāsana*) to liberate beings and perform Buddha-work.

**別、圓佛皆慈悲薰法性，愍眾生故垂應法界。當知四佛住本佛住，以慈悲故住於忍土王城，威儀住世，是名迹住。**  
- The Distinct and Perfect Buddhas both perfume the Dharma-Nature with kindness and compassion; out of pity for sentient beings they manifest a Response in the Dharma Realm.
- One should know that the Four Buddhas [in their Origin] dwell in the "Original Buddha Abode," but because of kindness and compassion they dwell in the Royal City of the Land of Endurance (*Saha*), displaying dignified deportment to dwell in the world. This is named "Trace Dwelling."

**[209] 觀解者，觀住於境，或住無常境，即空、即假、即中等境，以無住法住於境中故名為[3]住。**
[Interpretation via Contemplation:] "Dwelling" means dwelling in the Object (*jing*). Whether dwelling in the object of Impermanence, or the objects of Emptiness, Provisionality, or the Middle: because one dwells in the object via the Dharma of Non-Dwelling, it is named "Dwelling."

**[213] 「王舍城」者，天竺稱羅閱祇伽羅，羅閱祇此云王舍，伽羅此云城，國名摩伽陀，此云不害，無刑殺法也；亦云摩竭提，此云天羅，天羅者王名也，以王名國，此王即駁足之父。**
Regarding "Royal City" (*Wang She Cheng*): In India it is called *Rājagṛha* (*Luo Yue Qi* 羅閱祇). "Rājagṛha" means "Royal Abode" (*Wang She*); "*gara*" (*Jia Luo* 伽羅) means "City." The kingdom is named Magadha (*Mo Qie Tuo* 摩伽陀). This translates as "No Harm" (*Bu Hai*), meaning there are no laws of execution or killing. It is also [written] *Mojie Ti* 摩竭提 (another form of Magadha), which translates as "Celestial Net" (*Tian Luo*). "Celestial Net" is the name of a king; the country was named after the king. This king was the father of Spotted Feet (*Kalmāṣapāda*).

**昔久遠劫，此王主千小國，王巡山值牸師子，眾人迸散，仍共王交。後月滿來殿上生，王知是己子，訛言我既無兒，此乃天賜，養為太子，足上斑駁，時人號為駁足。**  
Long ago in a distant kalpa, this king ruled a thousand small states. The king toured the mountains and encountered a lioness. His entourage scattered, and [the lioness] had intercourse with the king. Later, when her months were full, she came to the palace and gave birth. The king knew it was his own child but falsely said: "Since I have no sons, this is heaven-bestowed." He raised him as Crown Prince. His feet were spotted (*ban bo*); the people of the time called him "Spotted Feet" (*Bo Zu*).

**後紹王位，喜噉肉，勅厨人無令肉少，一時遽闕，乃取城西新死小兒為膳。王言大美，勅之常辦此肉，厨人日捕一人，舉國愁恐，千小國興兵廢王，置耆闍山中，諸羅剎輔之為鬼王，因與山神誓，誓取千[4]王祭山。**  
Later he succeeded to the throne. He loved to eat meat and ordered the cook never to let meat be scarce. Once, when [meat] was suddenly lacking, [the cook] took a newly dead child from west of the city and served it. The king said it was greatly delicious and ordered him to always provide this meat. The cook captured one person daily. The whole kingdom was in sorrow and terror. The thousand small states raised armies to depose the king and placed him in the Vulture Peak mountains. The *Rakshasas* assisted him to become a Demon King. Because of this he made a vow to the Mountain Spirit: "I vow to capture one thousand kings to sacrifice to the mountain."

**捕得九百九十九，唯少普明王，後時伺執得之。大啼哭，恨生來實語，而今乖信。駁足放之還國，作大施，立太子，仍就死，形悅心安。駁足問之，答：「得聞聖法。」因令說之，廣讚慈心，毀呰殺害，仍說四非常偈(云云)。**  
He captured nine hundred and ninety-nine; he was only missing King Universal Brightness (*Pu Ming*). Later, spying him, he captured him. [King Pu Ming] wept greatly, regretting that while he had been truthful all his life, now he would break a promise [to a Brahmin]. Spotted Feet released him to return to his kingdom to make great offerings and set up a Crown Prince, then [Pu Ming] returned to die, his form joyful and heart at peace. Spotted Feet asked him [why]. He answered: "I got to hear the Holy Dharma." [Spotted Feet] ordered him to speak it. He broadly praised the mind of kindness (*metta*) and reviled killing and harming, then spoke the four verses on Impermanence (etc.).[^139]

[^139]: **Four Impermanence Verses**: Refers to the famous *gatha*: "All conditioned phenomena are impermanent, / This is the law of arising and ceasing. / When arising and ceasing are extinguished, / The cessation [Nirvana] is bliss." (Anitya-gatha).

**駁足聞法，得空平等地，即初地也。千王各取一渧血、三條髮，賽山神願。駁足與千王共立舍城，都五山中為大國，各以千小國付子胤，千王更[5]迭知大國事。又百姓在五山內，七[6]遍作舍，七度被燒，百姓議云：「由我薄福數致煨燼，王有福力其舍不燒，自今已後皆排我屋為王舍。」由是[7]免燒，故稱王舍城。**  
Spotted Feet heard the Dharma and attained the Empty Equality Ground (*Śūnyatā-sama-bhūmi*?), which is the First Ground (*Bhūmi*). From [each of] the thousand kings he took one drop of blood and three hairs to fulfill the vow to the Mountain Spirit. Spotted Feet and the thousand kings together established a walled city (*She Cheng*) and made their capital among the five mountains as a Great Kingdom. Each entrusted their thousand small states to their descendants, and the thousand kings took turns administering the affairs of the Great Kingdom. Furthermore, the common people built houses within the five mountains seven times, and seven times they were burned. The people discussed, saying: "Because of our meager merit, we repeatedly end in ashes. The King has the power of merit; his house does not burn. From now on, let us arrange all our houses to be the King's House (*Wang She*)." Because of this they avoided fire; therefore it is called "Royal House City" (*Wang She Cheng* / Rajgir).

**[220] 約教者，《像法決疑經》云：「一切大眾所見不同，或見娑羅林地，悉是土砂、草木、石壁，或見七寶清淨莊嚴，或見此林是三世諸佛所遊行處，或見此林即是不可思議諸佛境界真實法體。」例知此義，四見不同，所住既然，能住亦爾。此則約教分別也。本迹、觀心在後說。**  
Interpretation via the Teachings: The *Xiang Fa Jue Yi Jing* (*Sutra of Resolving Doubts in the Semblance Dharma*) says: "The seeing of the entire great assembly was not the same. Some saw the grounds of the Sala Grove as entirely dirt, sand, grass, trees, and stone walls [Tripitaka]. Some saw it as pure and adorned with the seven jewels [Shared/Distinct]. Some saw this grove as the place where the Buddhas of the three times wander [Distinct]. Some saw this grove as precisely the inconceivable realm of the Buddhas, the True Dharma Essence [Perfect]." By example one knows this meaning: the four seeings are different. Since the Place Dwelt In (*Suo Zhu*) is like this, the Subject Dwelling (*Neng Zhu*) is also like this. This is the distinction via the Teachings. Origin/Trace and Contemplation of Mind will be explained later.

**[222] 「耆闍崛山」者，此翻靈鷲，亦[8]云鷲頭，亦云狼跡，梁武云：「王鴡引[9]詩人所詠關睢是也。」《爾雅》云：「似鵄。」又解，山峯似鷲，將峯名山。**  
Regarding "Mount *Gṛdhrakūṭa*" (*Qi She Jue Shan*): This translates as "Spirit Vulture" (*Ling Jiu*). It is also called "Vulture Head" (*Jiu Tou*) and "Wolf Trace" (*Lang Ji*). Emperor Wu of Liang said: "It is the Osprey (*Wang Ju*), the 'Guan Ju' sung of by the [Book of] Odes poets." The *Erya* says: "It resembles an owl/kite." Another explanation: The mountain peak resembles a vulture; taking the peak to name the mountain.

**又云，山南有[10]尸陀林，鷲[11]食[＊10-1]尸竟[12]棲其山，時人呼為鷲山。又解，前佛今佛皆居此山，若佛滅後羅漢住，法滅支佛住，無支佛鬼神住。既是聖靈所居，總有三事，因呼為靈鷲山。**  
Another says: South of the mountain is a *Śītavana* (Corpse Grove). The vultures eat the corpses and then roost on the mountain; people of the time called it Vulture Mountain. Another explanation: The Past Buddhas and Present Buddha all dwell on this mountain. If the Buddha enters extinction, Arhats dwell there. If the Dharma is extinct, Pratyekabuddhas dwell there. If there are no Pratyekabuddhas, ghosts and spirits dwell there. Since it is where Holy Spirits (*Sheng Ling*) dwell, combining the three matters [holiness, spirit, vulture?], it is called Spirit Vulture Mountain.

**有五精舍：鞞婆羅[13]跋[14]恕，此云天[15]主穴；薩多般那求訶，此云七葉[16]穴；因陀世羅求訶，此云蛇神山；薩簸恕魂直迦鉢婆羅，此云少獨力山；五是耆闍崛山。**
There are Five Viharas (*Jing She*):[^141]
1.  *Vaibhāra-guhā* (*Pi Po Luo Ba Shu* 鞞婆羅跋恕): Translates as "Cave of the Celestial Lord."
2.  *Saptaparṇa-guhā* (*Sa Duo Ban Na Qiu He* 薩多般那求訶): Translates as "Seven-Leaf Cave."
3.  *Indraśaila-guhā* (*Yin Tuo Shi Luo Qiu He* 因陀世羅求訶): Translates as "Snake God Mountain."[^140]
4.  *Sarpaśuṇḍikā-prāgbhāra* (*Sa Bo Shu Hun Zhi Jia Bo Po Luo* 薩簸恕魂直迦鉢婆羅): Translates as "Small Independence Mountain."
5.  *Gṛdhrakūṭa* (Vulture Peak).
These five [together] are the Gṛdhrakūṭa Mountains [range].

[^140]: **Indraśaila vs. Snake God**: Zhiyi translates *Indraśaila* (Indra's Rock) as "Snake God Mountain." This might be a conflation or a reference to a specific localized legend regarding nāgas at that site.

[^141]: **Five Viharas**: Zhiyi's Chinese transliterations preserve 7th-century Indian vernacular forms that differ from classical Sanskrit. Modern scholars reconstruct: (1) *Vaibhāra-guhā* (Cave of Vaibhāra), (2) *Saptaparṇa-guhā* (Seven-Leaf Cave—where the First Buddhist Council was held), (3) *Indraśaila-guhā* (Indra's Rock Cave), (4) *Sarpaśuṇḍikā-prāgbhāra* (possibly "Serpent's Hood Mountain"), (5) *Gṛdhrakūṭa* (Vulture Peak). These five sites formed a monastic complex on and around the mountain.

**[235] 問：劫火洞然，天地廓清，云何前佛後佛同居此山？**  
Question: The Kalpa Fire burns everything; heaven and earth are swept clean. How can Past Buddhas and Future Buddhas dwell together on this [same] mountain?

**答：後劫立，本相還現，得神通人，知昔名以名今耳。例如先劫姓瞿曇，將本姓以姓今也。**  
Answer: When the later kalpa is established, the Original Characteristic (*Ben Xiang*) manifests again. People who have attained spiritual powers know the ancient names and use them to name the present [features]. It is like the surname Gautama in a prior kalpa; one takes the original surname to use as the surname today.

**[243] 約教釋「山」，例如城義[17]說(云云)。**
Interpretation of "Mountain" via the Teachings: It is like the explanation for the meaning of "City" [above—Tripitaka/Shared = Nirvana; Distinct/Perfect = Secret Store]. (etc.)

**[247] 觀釋者，王即心王，舍即五陰，心王造此舍，若析五陰舍空，空為涅槃城，此觀既淺如見土木；若[18]體五陰舍即空，[19]空為涅槃城，即通教也；**  
Interpretation via Contemplation: "King" is the Mind-King (*Citta*). "House" (*She*) is the Five Skandhas. The Mind-King constructs this House.
- If one **analyzes** the House of the Five Skandhas as empty, and Emptiness is the City of Nirvana—this contemplation is shallow, like seeing [the Pure Land as] dirt and wood [Tripitaka].
- If one **embodies** the House of the Five Skandhas as [intrinsically] empty, and Emptiness is the City of Nirvana—this is the Shared Teaching.

**若觀五陰舍，因滅是色獲得常色，受、想、行、識亦復如是，此之四德常為諸佛之所遊處；若觀五陰即法性，法性無受、想、行、識，一切眾生即是涅槃，不可復滅，畢竟空寂舍，如是涅槃，即是真如實體(云云)。**  
- If one contemplates the House of the Five Skandhas: "By extinguishing this Form (*Rūpa*), one obtains Permanent Form" (*Nirvana Sutra* citation), and Feeling, Perception, Volition, and Consciousness are also like this—these Four Virtues [Permanence, Bliss, Self, Purity] are the place where all Buddhas eternally wander.
- If one contemplates the Five Skandhas as precisely the Dharma-Nature: Dharma-Nature has no Feeling, Perception, Volition, or Consciousness. "All sentient beings *are* precisely Nirvana and cannot be extinguished again" (*Vimalakirti Sutra* citation). This is the House of Ultimate Empty Silence. Such a Nirvana is the Substance of True Suchness (*Bhutatathatā*) (etc.).

**[252] 觀心山者，若觀色陰，無知如山，識陰如靈，三陰如鷲，觀此靈鷲無常，即析觀也；觀此靈鷲即空，體觀也；**  
Regarding Contemplation of the "Mind-Mountain":
- If one contemplates the Form Skandha: it is without cognition, like a "Mountain."
- The Consciousness Skandha is like the "Spirit."
- The three [middle] Skandhas [Feeling, Perception, Volition] are like the "Vulture."
- Contemplating this "Spirit Vulture" as Impermanent is the **Analytic Contemplation** (*Xi Guan* - Tripitaka).
- Contemplating this "Spirit Vulture" as Empty is the **Embodied Contemplation** (*Ti Guan* - Shared).

**觀靈即智性了因，智慧莊嚴也，鷲即聚集緣因，福德莊嚴也，山即法性正因，不動三法，名祕密藏；自住其中亦用度人，下文云：「佛自住大乘」，即別、圓二觀(云云)。**
- Contemplating "Spirit" [Consciousness] as the Wisdom Nature (*Zhi Xing*), the Understanding Cause (*Liao Yin*)—this is the Adornment of Wisdom.
- "Vulture" [Feeling/Perception/Volition] is Aggregation, the Conditional Cause (*Yuan Yin*)—this is the Adornment of Merit.
- "Mountain" [Form/Body] is the Dharma-Nature, the Correct Cause (*Zheng Yin*).[^142]
- These Three Dharmas [Three Causes of Buddha Nature] being immovable is named the **Secret Store** (*Bi Mi Zang*). One dwells within this oneself and also uses it to liberate others. The text below says: "The Buddha himself dwells in the Great Vehicle." These are the two contemplations of Distinct and Perfect.

[^142]: **Three Causes of Buddha Nature** (三因佛性): (1) **Correct Cause** (*Zheng Yin* 正因)—Dharma-Nature itself, the ontological ground; (2) **Understanding Cause** (*Liao Yin* 了因)—Wisdom that illuminates the Correct Cause; (3) **Conditional Cause** (*Yuan Yin* 緣因)—Merit and skillful means that support realization. These correspond to the Three Bodies (*Trikāya*): Dharma-body (*Dharmakāya*), Wisdom-body (*Sambhogakāya*), and Response-body (*Nirmāṇakāya*). This is a core Tiantai doctrine elaborated in *Fahua Xuanyi* and *Mohe Zhiguan*.

**[254] 「中」者，佛好中道，[＊13-1]升中天、中日、降中國、中夜滅，皆表中道；今處山中，說中道也。**  
Regarding "Within" (*Zhong*): The Buddha prefers the Middle Way. He ascended to the Middle Heaven [Trayastrimsha?], was born on a Middle Day [8th/15th?], descended in the Middle Country [Madhyadesha], and entered extinction at Middle Night. All these represent the Middle Way. Now, dwelling "within" the mountain, he preaches the Middle Way.

**[258] 釋同聞眾為三：初聲聞、次菩薩、後雜眾，諸經多爾。舊云有事、有義。**  
Explaining the "Audience that Heard Together" (*Tong Wen Zhong*), there are three [groups]: first Sravakas, next Bodhisattvas, and lastly the Miscellaneous Host (*Za Zhong*). Many Sutras are like this. Old Interpretations say there is [an explanation via] Affairs (*Shi*) and Meaning (*Yi*).

**事者，[1]逐形迹親疎，聲聞形出俗網，迹近如來，證經為親，故前列也；天人形乖服異，迹非侍奉，證經為疎，故後列也；菩薩形不[2]檢節、迹無定處，既不同俗，復異於僧，處季孟之間，故居中仲也。**  
Regarding Affairs (*Shi*): It follows the closeness or distance of their Form and Traces (*Xing Ji*).
- **Sravakas**: Their form has exited the mundane net; their traces are close to the Tathagata. For testifying to the Sutra they are "Close/Intimate," therefore they are listed first.
- **Gods and Humans**: Their forms are contrary [to the Sangha] and their clothing is different; their traces are not those of attendance/service. For testifying to the Sutra they are "Distant," therefore they are listed last.
- **Bodhisattvas**: Their forms are not restrained/regulated [by monies rules]; their traces have no fixed place. Since they are not the same as the vulgar [laity], but also differ from the [monastic] Sangha, they dwell between the youngest and eldest; therefore they occupy the middle.

**有義者，聲聞欣涅槃，天人著生死，各有所偏，菩薩不欣、不著，居中求宗，故在兩間。《釋論》意亦爾，此一解似兩釋，事解似因緣，義解似約教(云云)。**  
Regarding Meaning (*Yi*):
- **Sravakas** rejoice in Nirvana.
- **Gods and Humans** are attached to Birth and Death. Each has a bias (*pian*).
- **Bodhisattvas** do not rejoice [in Nirvana alone] and are not attached [to Samsara]; they dwell in the Middle seeking the Ancestor/Source (*Zong*). Therefore they are in between the two.
The intention of the *Treatise* (*Da Zhidu Lun*) is also like this. This one explanation seems to contain two interpretations: the "Affairs" explanation resembles Causes and Conditions; the "Meaning" explanation resembles the Teachings (etc.).

### Protocol Map: Fascicle 1 (Lines 261-290)
1.  **Interpretation of the Audience (continued):**
    -   **Origin/Trace:** Sravakas secretly store inward mystery while manifesting outwardly; Gods/Humans are Great Beings (*Mahasattvas*).
    -   **Contemplation:** Empty (Breaks Samsara), Provisional (Breaks Nirvana), Middle (No Before/After).
2.  **Specific Audience - Sravakas (Bhikshus):**
    -   **Classification:** Bhikshus & Bhikshunis.
    -   **Bhikshus Categories:** 1. Many Knowledge (*Duo Zhi Shi* - Great Renown), 2. Few Knowledge (*Shao Zhi Shi* - Lesser Renown).
    -   **Analysis of "Many Knowledge" via Six Points:** 1. Category, 2. Number, 3. Position, 4. Praise, 5. Listing Names, 6. Conclusion.
3.  **Explanation of "Great" (Da):**
    -   **General:** Great (Respected by Great Men), Many (Knowing Inner/Outer Classics), Superior (Exceeding 95 Paths).
    -   **Teachings:** Seven Unities of the Sangha (Tripitaka -> Round).
    -   **Four Teachings on "Great/Many/Superior":**
        -   *Tripitaka:* Respected by kings; knows birth/death; exceeds 4 Vedas.
        -   *Shared:* Respected by Reviewing Arhats; knows No-Birth; exceeds Three Pitakas.
        -   *Distinct:* Respected by Embodied Law Arhats; knows measureless Dharma; exceeds Two Vehicles.
        -   *Perfect:* Respected by Great Bodhisattvas; knows Dharma Realm; exceeds Bodhisattvas.
    -   **Origin/Trace:** Traces manifested to lead milk -> cream -> ghee. Original "Great" is distinct.
    -   **Contemplation:** Empty=Great, Provisional=Many, Middle=Superior.
4.  **Explanation of "Bhikshu" (Bi Qiu):**
    -   **Etymology:** Kumarajiva: "Pure Livelihood"; Sengzhao: "Mendicant, Destroyer of Affliction, Precept Holder, Frightener of Maras."
    -   **Siddhantas:** Frightener of Mara (Counteracting), Destroyer of Evil (First Principle), Mendicant (Worldly/Person).
    -   **Teachings:**
        -   *Tripitaka:* White Fourth Karma, preventing evil.
        -   *Shared:* Seeking Truth via Conditions (Mendicant), Breaking Obstacles to Principle (Destroyer), Frightening Four Maras.
        -   *Distinct:* Seeking Truth via Three Truths, Breaking Distinct Delusion, Frightening Eight/Ten Maras.
        -   *Perfect:* Seeking Reality in Samsara, Affliction=Bodhi, Mara Realm=Buddha Realm.

**[263] 本迹解者，聲聞內祕外現，何甞保證涅槃；天人皆大薩埵，豈復耽染生死？皆是迹引二邊，而本常中道也。**  
Interpretation via Origin and Trace: The Sravakas possess the "Inward Mystery" but "Outwardly Manifest" [as Hearers]; how could they ever [truly] cling to witnessing Nirvana? The Gods and Humans are all Great Beings (*Mahāsattvas*); how could they indulge in or be defiled by birth and death? These are all Traces guiding [those attached to] the Two Extremes, while the Origin eternally dwells in the Middle Way.

**[265] 觀心釋者，從假入空觀，即偏破生死；從空入假觀，即偏破涅槃，中道正觀無復前後(云云)。**  
Interpretation via Contemplation of Mind:
- Entering the Empty Contemplation from the Provisional is the partial destruction of Birth and Death.
- Entering the Provisional Contemplation from the Empty is the partial destruction of Nirvana.
- The Correct Contemplation of the Middle Way has no "before" or "after" (etc.).

**[267] 列聲聞為二：先比丘、[3]次比丘尼。比丘又二：先列多知識，次列少知識；舊呼為大名聞、小名聞。雖然無據，今依文判如此。**  
Listing the Sravakas, there are two [groups]: first Bhikshus, next Bhikshunis.
The Bhikshus are also [divided into] two: first listing those of "Many Knowledge" (*Duo Zhi Shi*), next listing those of "Few Knowledge" (*Shao Zhi Shi*). Old interpretations call these "Great Renown" (*Da Ming Wen*) and "Small Renown" (*Xiao Ming Wen*). Although there is no specific textual proof [for these titles], I explicitly judge it so based on the text.

**就多知識眾為六：一類、二數、三位、四[4]歎、五列名、六結。**  
Regarding the Assembly of "Many Knowledge," there are six [sub-points]:
1.  Category (*Lei* - "Great")
2.  Number (*Shu* - "12,000")
3.  Position (*Wei* - "Arhats")
4.  Praise (*Tan* - "Exhausted all outflows")
5.  Listing Names (*Lie Ming*)
6.  Conclusion (*Jie*)

**[272] 一、類者，皆是大比丘氣類也。譬群方貴賤，各有班輩。今諸比丘，皆眾所知識、高譽大德也。**  
1. **Category**: These are all of the class/category of "Great Bhikshus." Just as in the various regions the noble and base each have their ranks and peers, now these Bhikshus are all well-known (*Zhi Shi*) to the multitude, of high repute and great virtue.

**[274] 《釋論》明「與」者，共義，舉七一解共，謂一時、一處、一戒、一心、一見、一道、一解脫也。**  
The *Treatise* (*Da Zhidu Lun*) explains "Together with" (*Yu*) as the meaning of "Common/Shared" (*Gong*). It cites "Seven Unities" to explain "Common": 1. One Time, 2. One Place, 3. One Precepts, 4. One Mind, 5. One View, 6. One Path, 7. One Liberation.

**若歷教，應各明七一：三藏一七一，通教二七一，別教無量七一，圓教一七一。若未發迹，正是三藏、通教中七一，直明兩意幾異，時、處、戒、解脫是同，心、見、道三種則異；若至開三顯一，即得入圓教七一也。**  
If applying the Teachings, one should explain the Seven Unities for each:
- Tripitaka: One [set of] Seven Unities.
- Shared Teaching: Two [sets of] Seven Unities.
- Distinct Teaching: Immeasurable Seven Unities.
- Perfect Teaching: One [set of] Seven Unities.
If the Trace has not yet been revealed (*Wei Fa Ji*), it is essentially the Seven Unities of the Tripitaka and Shared Teachings. Strictly speaking, the two meanings have some differences: Time, Place, Precepts, and Liberation are the same; Mind, View, and Path differ. If one comes to "Opening the Three and Revealing the One," then one enters the Seven Unities of the Perfect Teaching.

**[276] 《法華》[5]論四種聲聞，今開住果者為兩：析法住果是三藏聲聞，體法住果是通教聲聞。開應化者為兩：登地應化別教聲聞，登住應化圓教聲聞。**  
The *Lotus Sutra Treatise* (*Fa Hua Lun*) discusses Four Kinds of Sravakas.[^143] Now, "Opening the Fruit Abiders" makes two:
- Analyzing Dharma to Abide in the Fruit = Tripitaka Sravaka.
- Embodying Dharma to Abide in the Fruit = Shared Sravaka.
"Opening the Manifested Responses" makes two:
- Manifested Response from the Grounds (*Bhūmi*) = Distinct Sravaka.
- Manifested Response from the Abodes (*Vihāra*) = Perfect Sravaka.

[^143]: **Four Kinds of Sravakas**: Typically: (1) Fixed Sravakas (*Niyata*), (2) Arrogant Sravakas, (3) Retrogressing Bodhisattvas, (4) Transformation/Response Sravakas (*Nirmita*). Tiantai re-maps these to the Four Teachings.

**開佛道聲聞亦為兩：令他次第聞佛道是別教聲聞，令他不次第聞佛道即圓聲聞。聲聞義浩然，云何以證涅槃者判之(云云)。**  
"Opening the Buddha-Path Sravakas" also makes two:
- Causing others to hear the Buddha Path sequentially = Distinct Sravaka.
- Causing others to hear the Buddha Path non-sequentially = Perfect Sravaka.
The meaning of "Sravaka" (Hearer) is vast; how can one judge it merely by "Witnessing Nirvana"? (etc.)

**[280] 「大」者，《釋論》明「大」者，亦言多，亦言勝，器量尊重為天王等大人所敬故言大，[＊13-2]升出九十五種[6]道外故言勝，遍知內外經書故言多，又數至一萬二千故言多。**  
Regarding "Great" (*Da*): The *Treatise* explains "Great" as meaning "Many" (*Duo*) and "Superior" (*Sheng*).
- **Great**: Because their capacity is dignified and heavy, and they are respected by Great Men like the Heavenly Kings.
- **Superior**: Because they ascend beyond the 95 kinds of [non-Buddhist] paths.
- **Many**: Because they completely know the inner and outer classics/books. Also, because their number reaches 12,000.

**今明有大道故、有大用故、有大知故，故言大。勝者，道勝、用勝、知勝，故言勝。多者，道多、用多、知多，故言多。**  
Now I explain:
- **Great**: Because they have the Great Path, Great Function, and Great Knowledge.
- **Superior**: Because the Path is Superior, the Function is Superior, and the Knowledge is Superior.
- **Many**: Because the Path is Many, the Function is Many, and the Knowledge is Many.

**道即性念處，大於一切智外道；用即共念處，勝神通外道；知即緣念處，多四韋陀外道也。**
- **Path**: Only the Nature Identification (*Xing Nian Chu* - *Smṛtyupasthāna*), which is greater than the Omniscient Non-Buddhists.
- **Function**: Only the Common Identification (*Gong Nian Chu*), which is superior to the Non-Buddhists with spiritual powers.
- **Knowledge**: Only the Conditional Identification (*Yuan Nian Chu*), which is more [learned] than the Non-Buddhists of the Four Vedas.

**約教釋大、多、勝者，大人所敬等，是三藏中釋耳。大者，大力羅漢所敬也；多者，遍知生滅即無生滅法也；勝者，勝三藏四門也，此通教釋也。**  
Interpretation of Great/Many/Superior via the Teachings:
- "Respected by Great Men, etc." is the interpretation within the **Tripitaka**.
- **Shared Teaching**:
    - *Great*: Respected by Great Power Arhats.
    - *Many*: Completely knowing that the arising/ceasing Dharma *is precisely* non-arising/non-ceasing.
    - *Superior*: Superior to the Four Gates of the Tripitaka.

**又大者，體法大力羅漢所敬也；多者，恒沙佛法皆知也；勝者，勝二乘人，此別教釋也。又大者，諸大菩薩所敬也；多者，法界不可量法悉知也；勝者，勝諸菩薩也，此圓教釋也。**  
- **Distinct Teaching**:
    - *Great*: Respected by the "Embodying-Dharma Great Power Arhats" [Shared].
    - *Many*: Knowing all Buddha Dharmas as numerous as Ganges sands.
    - *Superior*: Superior to the people of the Two Vehicles.
- **Perfect Teaching**:
    - *Great*: Respected by Great Bodhisattvas.
    - *Many*: Knowing fully the immeasurable Dharmas of the Dharma Realm.
    - *Superior*: Superior to all [lower] Bodhisattvas.

**[285] 本迹者，此諸大德久為諸佛之所咨嗟，本得勝幢三昧超諸外道，先已成就種智遍知，迹來輔佛行化，示作愛見中大、多、勝，欲引乳入酪；又作三藏中大、多、勝，欲引酪入生蘇；**  
[Origin and Trace:] These Great Virtues have long been praised by the Buddhas. Originally/Fundamentally (*Ben*) they attained the Victorious Banner Samadhi (*Dhvaja-agra-keyūra*?), surpassing non-Buddhists, and long ago achieved the Omniscience of Species (*Sarvathā-jñāna* - *Zhong Zhi*) to know all. As Traces (*Ji*) they come to assist the Buddha's transforming work.
- They manifest the Great/Many/Superior within Love and Views [Worldly] to lead Milk into Cream.
- They manifest the Great/Many/Superior within the Tripitaka to lead Cream into Curds.

**示方等中大、多、勝，欲引生蘇入熟蘇；示轉教作《般若》中大、多、勝；欲引熟蘇入醍醐故作《法華》中大、多、勝也，然其本地大、多、勝又矣(云云)。**  
- They manifest the Great/Many/Superior within the *Vaipulya* to lead Curds into Butter.
- They manifest the Transformed Teaching making the Great/Many/Superior within *Prajña* to lead Butter into Ghee.
- Therefore they make the Great/Many/Superior within the *Lotus* [Ghee].
However, the Great/Many/Superior of their Origin Stage is something else again (etc.).

**[287] 觀心者，空觀為大，假觀為多，中觀為勝。又直就中觀心性廣博猶若虛空，故名大；雙遮二邊入寂滅海，故名勝；雙照二諦多所含容，一心一切心，故名多也。**  
[Contemplation of Mind:] The Empty Contemplation is "Great." The Provisional Contemplation is "Many." The Middle Contemplation is "Superior."
Also, pointing directly to the Middle Contemplation:
- The Mind-Nature is broad and vast like empty space; thus named "**Great**."
- Double-Blocking the Two Extremes to enter the Ocean of Extinction; thus named "**Superior**."
- Double-Illuminating the Two Truths so there is much that is contained/accepted—One Mind is All Minds; thus named "**Many**."

**[289] 「比丘」者，肇師云：「秦言淨命，乞食、破煩惱、能持戒、怖魔等，天竺一名含此四義，秦無以翻，故存本稱。」什師云：「始出妻子家，應以乞食自資，清淨活命；終出三界家，必須破煩惱，持戒自守。具此二義，天魔怖[7]其出境也。」**  
Regarding "Bhikshu" (*Bi Qiu*): Master [Seng]zhao says: "In Qin [Chinese] it means 'Pure Livelihood' (*Jing Ming*). The single Indian name contains four meanings: Mendicant (*Qi Shi*), Destroyer of Affliction (*Po Fan Nao*), Holder of Precepts (*Chi Jie*), and Frightener of Maras (*Bu Mo*). Since Qin has no single term to translate it, the original appellation is preserved."
Master [Kumara]jiva says: "In the beginning one leaves the house of wife and children; one should use begging for food to support oneself, creating a Pure Livelihood. In the end one leaves the house of the Triple World; one must destroy afflictions and hold precepts to guard oneself. Possessing these two meanings, the Heavenly Maras are frightened that he will exit their realm."

**《釋論》云：「怖魔、破惡、乞士，魔樂生死，其既出家復化餘人，俱離三界乖於魔意，魔用力制翻被五繫，但愁懼而已，故名怖魔。出家人必破身、口[8]七惡，故言破惡。夫在家三種如法，一田、二商、三仕，用養身命；出家人佛不許此，唯乞自濟，身安道存，福利檀越，三義相成即比丘義也。」**  
The *Treatise* says: "**Frightener of Mara, Destroyer of Evil, Mendicant Scholar**."
- *Frightener of Mara*: Mara delights in Birth and Death. Since [the Bhikshu] has left home and also transforms others so they all leave the Triple World, acting contrary to Mara's intent... Mara uses force to try to restrain him but conversely [Mara] is bound by the Five Ties. [Mara] can only worry and fear; thus named "Frightener of Mara."
- *Destroyer of Evil*: The homeless release must destroy the Seven Evils of body and mouth; thus "Destroyer of Evil."
- *Mendicant Scholar*: For laypeople there are three lawful livelihoods: agriculture, commerce, and service/officialdom, used to nourish the body/life. The Buddha does not permit these for renunciants. By begging alone one sustains oneself. The body is at peace and the Way is preserved; one brings merit and benefit to the *Danapati* (Donor). These three meanings complete each other; this is the meaning of Bhikshu.

**《涅槃》、《寶梁》皆舉破惡名比丘者，不具說也。今明此三義，應通初、後，如初出家時白四羯磨，無作戒力遍一切境，翻無作惡；初修禪定發定共戒，防伏意地貪、瞋不起；初修觀慧發相似道共戒，能伏煩惱。初心亦稱破惡，何獨後心耶？**  
The *Nirvana Sutra* and *Ratnarāśi Sutra* (*Bao Liang*) both cite "Destroyer of Evil" as the name for Bhikshu, but do not explain it fully. Now I clarify: these three meanings should communicate with both the Beginning and the End.
- Like when first leaving home: via the White Fourth Karma [ordination], the power of the Unmanifested (*Avijñapti*) Precept pervades all situations, overturning unmanifested evil.
- First cultivating Dhyana/Samadhi: generating the Samadhi-Associated Precept (*Ding Gong Jie*) to guard against and suppress avarice and anger from arising in the mind-ground.
- First cultivating Contemplative Wisdom: generating the Semblance Path-Associated Precept (*Dao Gong Jie*) able to suppress afflictions.
The "Initial Mind" is also called "Destroyer of Evil"; why only the "Later Mind" [Arhat]?

**怖[9]魔者，初剃髮、稟戒，已令魔愁，修定欲伏[10]惱煩，修慧欲破煩惱，初心亦令魔怖，何獨後心耶？乞士者，初離邪命以乞自活、修禪歷境、求定修慧緣理求無漏，皆是乞士，何況相應而非乞士？具此義[11]故通名比丘。依經家皆歎後心比丘耳，此皆三藏意。**  
- *Frightener of Mara*: Initially shaving the head and receiving precepts already makes Mara worry. Cultivating Samadhi to suppress affliction, cultivating Wisdom to destroy affliction—the Initial Mind also makes Mara afraid; why only the Later Mind?
- *Mendicant*: Initially leaving evil livelihood to beg for one's life; cultivating Dhyana to pass through states/objects; seeking Samadhi and cultivating Wisdom; conditioning on Principle to seek the No-Outflow. All are "Mendicants." How much more so those who correspond [to the Fruit]?
Possessing these meanings, they are generally named Bhikshu. However, the Sutra Compilers [usually] praise the "Later Mind" [Arhat] Bhikshus alone. This is all the meaning within the **Tripitaka**.

**若歷緣求真名乞士，破障理之惑名破惡，修此行怖四魔，即通教義。**  
- If passing through conditions to seek the True—named Mendicant.
- Destroying the delusion that obstructs Principle—named Destroyer of Evil.
- Cultivating this practice to frighten the Four Maras.
This is the meaning in the **Shared Teaching**.

**若歷三諦求理名乞士，除通、別惑名破惡，怖八魔十魔者，即別義。**  
- If passing through the Three Truths to seek Principle—named Mendicant.
- Eliminating Shared and Distinct Delusions—named Destroyer of Evil.
- Frightening Eight Maras or Ten Maras.
This is the meaning in the **Distinct Teaching**.

**若即生死求實相味名乞士，達煩惱即菩提名破惡，魔界即佛界者，是圓教義。**  
- If "Precisely in Birth and Death seeking the flavor of Real Characteristic"—named Mendicant.
- Understanding Affliction *is* Bodhi—named Destroyer of Evil.
- [Understanding] the Mara Realm *is* the Buddha Realm.
This is the meaning in the **Perfect Teaching**.

**若未發迹但明前二義，若已顯本，具後意也。**  
If the Trace has not been revealed, it explains only the first two meanings [Tripitaka/Shared]. If the Origin has been revealed, it possesses the latter meanings [Distinct/Perfect].

### Protocol Map: Fascicle 1 (Lines 291-320)
1.  **Origin/Trace & Contemplation (continued):**
    -   **Origin/Trace:** Leaving Parents of Ignorance/Craving, Wife of Karma -> 5 Abodes Removed.
    -   **Contemplation:** Mind Pure like Space (Leaving Home), Middle Way Wisdom (Mendicant), Affliction=Bodhi (Destroyer), Middle Way (Frightener).
2.  **Explanation of "Assembly/Sangha" (Zhong):**
    -   **Definition:** *Sangha* = Harmonious Assembly (*He He Zhong*). 4+ people = Harmony.
    -   **Specific Numbers:** 1250 total (3 Kasyapas=1000, Sariputra/Moggallana=250, Yasa=50).
    -   **Four Kinds of Sangha (Treatise):** Shameless, Ignorant, Shameful (5 Expedients), True (Arhats).
    -   **Classification:** This assembly is the "True Sangha" (*Zhen Shi Seng*).
    -   **Origin/Trace:** Harmony with Real Characteristic (Li He) & Mechanism (*Ji*).
    -   **Contemplation:** Semblance View = Shameful; Real Wisdom = True.
3.  **Explanation of "Number" (Shu):**
    -   **Literal:** 12,000.
    -   **Origin/Trace:** 12,000 Bodhisattvas.
    -   **Contemplation:** 12 Entrances (Ayatanas) x 10 Realms x 10 Realms x 10 Suchnesses = 12,000 Dharma Doors.
4.  **Explanation of "Position" (Wei):**
    -   **Arhat Meanings:** No Birth (*Wu Sheng*), Killer of Thieves (*Sha Zei*), Worthy of Offerings (*Ying Gong*).
    -   **Four Teachings Matrix:**
        -   *Tripitaka/Shared:* Destroying 98 Defilements (Killer), No Future Birth (No Birth), Field of Merit (Worthy).
        -   *Distinct/Perfect:* Killing "Non-Thieves" (Nirvana is the "Thief"), Not Born into Non-Birth (No Birth), Supplier of Offerings (*Gong Ying*) to sentient beings.
    -   **Origin/Trace:** Originally attained "Unreceptive Samadhi" (No Birth), severed 5 Abodes (Killer), benefits 9 Realms (Worthy).

**[297] 本迹者，本登涅槃山頂，與無明癡愛父母、結業妻子別，出分段、變易家，久除五住，何惡不破？獲真法喜，如食乳糜更無所[1]須。**  
Interpretation via Origin and Trace: Originally/Fundamentally they ascended the Summit of the Nirvana Mountain. They parted from the Parents of Ignorance and Deluded Craving, and the Wife of Bound Karma. They exited the House of Fragmentary (*Saha*) and Transformational (*Pariṇāma*) Birth and Death. Having long removed the Five Abodes [of Affliction], what evil have they not destroyed? They obtained true Dharma Joy, like eating milk-porridge with nothing more required (*Qi*).

**持中道道共尸波羅蜜攝眾生戒度，魔界降伏，即佛界如。堪任乘御，本地功德久已成就，為調眾生，迹示五味比丘傳引眾生，例如前釋。**  
Holding the Middle Way Path-Associated Śīla Pāramitā (Precepts) that gathers sentient beings, the Mara Realm is subdued—which is precisely the Suchness of the Buddha Realm. Capable of riding and driving [the Vehicle], the Merit of the Origin Stage was achieved long ago. For the sake of harmonizing sentient beings, as Traces they manifest as Bhikshus of the Five Flavors to transmit and guide sentient beings, as explained above.

**[301] 觀心者，觀一念心淨若虛空，不為二邊桎梏所礙，平等大慧無住、無著，即名出家；以中觀自資、活法身慧命，名為乞士；觀五住煩惱即是菩提，是名破惡；一切諸邊顛倒無非中道，即是怖[2]魔(云云)。**
Interpretation via Contemplation of Mind:
- Contemplating the One Thought Mind as pure like empty space, unobstructed by the shackles of the Two Extremes, with impartial Great Wisdom that is non-dwelling and non-attached—this is named **Leaving Home**.
- Using the Middle Contemplation to support oneself, keeping alive the Dharma-Body and Wisdom-Life—this is named **Mendicant Scholar**.
- Contemplating the Five Abodes of Affliction as *precisely* Bodhi—this is named **Destroyer of Evil**.
- All extremes and inversions are nothing other than the Middle Way—this is named **Frightener of Mara** (etc.).

**[305] 「眾」者，天竺云僧伽，此翻和合眾，一人不名和合，四人已上乃名和合，事和無別眾，法和無別理。**  
Regarding "Assembly" (*Zhong*): India says *Saṃgha*; here it is translated as "Harmonious Assembly" (*He He Zhong*). One person is not named "Harmonious"; four persons or more is named "Harmonious." "Harmony of Affairs" (*Shi He*) means no separate/distinct assembly [unanimous action]. "Harmony of Principle" (*Li He*) means no separate/distinct principle [same realization].

**佛常與千二百五十人俱，三迦葉千人，身子、目連二百五十。又云，耶舍五十。**  
The Buddha was constantly together with 1,250 people. The Three Kāśyapas [and their disciples] were 1,000 people. Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana [and disciples] were 250.[^144] Also it is said Yaśas [and disciples] were 50.

**《雜阿含》四十五云：「五百比丘中，九十人三明，九十人俱解脫，餘但慧解脫。」《釋論》明四種僧：不依淨命名破戒僧，不解法律名愚癡僧，五方便名慚愧僧，苦法忍去名真實僧。此中非三種，但是真實僧。若依四教者，此僧歷偏、圓五味座，作同聞人，今正是圓教中證信也。**  
The *Samyukta Agama* (Fascicle 45) says: "Among 500 Bhikshus, 90 have the Three Illuminations (*Trividyā*), 90 have Double Liberation (*Ubhayatobhāgavimukta*), and the rest have Wisdom Liberation (*Prajñāvimukta*)."
The *Treatise* explains Four Kinds of Sangha:
1.  Not relying on Pure Precepts—named **Shameless Sangha** (*Po Jie Seng*).
2.  Not understanding Dharma/Vinaya—named **Ignorant Sangha** (*Yu Chi Seng*).
3.  Five Expedients [trans. note: Stages prior to Stream Entry]—named **Shameful Sangha** (*Can Kui Seng*).
4.  From the Patience of Suffering Dharma (*Duḥkha-dharma-kṣānti*) onwards—named **True Sangha** (*Zhen Shi Seng*).
Here [in the Lotus Sutra], it is not the [first] three kinds; it is only the **True Sangha**.
If relying on the Four Teachings: this Sangha passes through the Five Flavors of the One-Sided and Perfect [Teachings] as the "Audience Hearing Together." Now [here] it is precisely the Testimony of Faith in the **Perfect Teaching**.

[^144]: **1250 Arhats**: The standard number listed in Sutras. Tiantai accounts for them: Uruvilva Kasyapa (500), Gaya Kasyapa (250), Nadi Kasyapa (250) = 1000. Sariputra (100) + Maudgalyayana (100) + Yasa (50) = 250.

**[307] 本迹釋者，本與實相理和，又與法界眾生機緣和，而迹為半字事理之僧，歷五味中引諸眾生(云云)。**  
Interpretation via Origin and Trace:
- Fundamentally (*Ben*) they harmonize with the Principle of Real Characteristic (*Shi Xiang Li*).
- Also they harmonize with the Capacities and Conditions (*Ji Yuan*) of sentient beings in the Dharma Realm.
- Traces (*Ji*) become the Sangha of the "Half-Word" [Hinayana] Affairs and Principles, passing through the Five Flavors to guide sentient beings (etc.).

**[309] 觀解者，初學中觀入相似觀，既未發真，慚第一義天、愧諸聖人，即是有羞僧；觀慧若發即真實僧。若異此者，即前兩僧：不依觀行名破戒僧，不解觀相名愚癡僧。[3]舉類義竟。**  
Interpretation via Contemplation:
- Initially studying the Middle Contemplation and entering Semblance Contemplation (*Xiang Si Guan*): Since one has not yet realized the True, one is "Ashamed before the Heaven of First Principle" and "Humbled before all Sages" (*Can Tian Kui Ren*); this is the **Shameful Sangha** [defined positively here].
- If Contemplative Wisdom arises, that is the **True Sangha**.
- If different from this [i.e., failing contemplation]:
    - Not relying on Contemplation Practice is named **Shameless Sangha**.
    - Not understanding Contemplation Characteristics is named **Ignorant Sangha**.
(Conclusion of the meaning of "Category".)

**[313] 二、明數者，即是一萬二千人也。本迹者，本是一萬二千菩薩，迹為萬二千聲聞也。**  
2. **Explaining Number**: It is 12,000 people.
- Origin/Trace: Fundamentally they are 12,000 Bodhisattvas; as Traces they are 12,000 Sravakas.

**觀者，觀十二入，一入具十法界，一界又十界，界界各十如是，即是一千，一入既一千，十二入即是萬二千法門也。**  
- Contemplation: Contemplate the Twelve Entrances (*Ayatanas*). One Entrance possesses the Ten Dharma Realms. One Realm again possesses Ten Realms [Mutual Possession = 100]. Each Realm has Ten Suchnesses [100 x 10 = 1,000]. Since one Entrance is 1,000, the Twelve Entrances are the 12,000 Dharma Doors.

**[315] 三、明位者，皆是阿羅漢也。《阿颰經》云應真；《瑞應》云真人，悉是無生釋羅漢也。依舊翻云無著、不生、應供。或言無翻，名含三義。**  
3. **Explaining Position**: "They were all Arhats."
The *Avatamsaka?* (*A Ba Jing*) says "Responding to Truth" (*Ying Zhen*). The *Rui Ying Jing* says "True Person" (*Zhen Ren*). All these explain Arhat as "No Birth." Relying on old translations: "No Attachment," "No Birth," "Worthy of Offerings." Or it is said it is untranslatable [phonetic], containing three meanings.

**無明糠脫，後世田中不受生死果報，故[4]云不生；九十八使煩惱盡，故名殺賊；具智斷功德，堪為人天福田，故言應供。含此三義釋阿羅漢也。**  
- The chaff of Ignorance is shed; one does not receive the fruit of birth and death in the field of future lives; therefore called **No Birth** (*Wu Sheng*).
- The 98 Drivers (*Anusaya* - Defilements) are exhausted; therefore called **Killer of Thieves** (*Sha Zei*).
- Possessing the merit of Wisdom and Severance, capable of being a Field of Merit for humans and gods; therefore called **Worthy of Offerings** (*Ying Gong*).
Containing these three meanings explains "Arhat."

**或言初始學無生，生未無生，初雖怖魔，魔未大怖，初雖乞士，未是灼然應供；今獲無生忍，破煩惱賊盡，是好良田，以果對因釋羅漢三義。**  
Or it is said: Initially one studies No Birth, but birth is not yet unborn. Initially though one Frightens Mara, Mara is not yet greatly frightened. Initially though a Mendicant, one is not yet visibly Worthy of Offerings. Now attaining the Patience of No Birth, destroying the thieves of affliction completely, being a good Field [of Merit]—this uses the Fruit to correspond to the Cause [Bhikshu] to explain the three meanings of Arhat.

**若論成就應取果三義，若通於初，亦取因三義，如此釋者，皆三藏通中意耳。**  
If discussing accomplishment, one should take the three meanings of the Fruit [No Birth, Killer, Worthy]. If communicating with the beginning, one also takes the three meanings of the Cause [Mendicant, Frightener, Destroyer]. Interpreting like this is all the intent of the **Tripitaka and Shared Teachings**.

**若別、圓者義則不然，非但殺賊，亦殺不賊，不賊者涅槃是，是亦須破故，是殺賊義。不生於生，亦不生不生，無漏是不生，非但應供亦是供應，一切眾生是供應，皆歎初地、初住德也。**
If interpreting via the **Distinct and Perfect**, the meaning is not so.
- Not only killing thieves, but also **Killing Non-Thieves**. "Non-Thieves" means Nirvana; this also must be destroyed [as an attachment]; therefore "Killer of Thieves."
- **Not Born into Birth, and also Not Born into Non-Birth**. "No-Outflow" is [defined as] Non-Birth.
- Not only Worthy of Offerings (*Ying Gong*), but also **Supplier of Offerings** (*Gong Ying*)—meaning one supplies/serves all sentient beings [not receiving from them].
These all praise the virtue of the First Ground (*Bhūmi*) [Distinct] or First Abode (*Vihāra*) [Perfect].

**[319] 本迹者，本得[5]不受三昧，於二邊無所著，故名不生；斷五住惑，故名殺賊；能福九道饒益眾生，故有應供。本義也。方便度眾生，歷五味傳傳作不生，迹也。又本是法身，迹示己利；本是般若，迹示不生；本是解脫，迹示殺賊(云云)。**  
Origin and Trace:
- Fundamentally obtaining the "Unreceptive Samadhi" (*Bu Shou San Mei* - *Anupādāna*?), with no attachment to the Two Extremes—thus named **No Birth**.
- Cutting off the Five Abodes of Delusion—thus named **Killer of Thieves**.
- Able to bring fortune to the Nine Paths and benefit sentient beings—thus named **Worthy of Offerings**. This is the meaning of the Origin.
- Using Skillful Means to liberate beings, passing through the Five Flavors sequentially to enact "No Birth"—this is the Trace.
- Also: Origin is Dharma Body; Trace manifests Self-Benefit. Origin is Prajna; Trace manifests No Birth. Origin is Liberation; Trace manifests Killing Thieves (etc.).

        -   *Interpretations:* Known the Original Limit (*Ben Ji*), Known Extinction.
        -   *Narrative 1 (Vow):* Buddha as Red-Eyed Fish, vowed to save the 5 carpenters (Kauṇḍinya et al.) first.

        -   *Narrative 3 (Practice):* First to see the "Morning Star" of Wisdom (No-Birth) like the dawn breaking the long night.
        -   *Narrative 4 (Actualization):* First of the Five Bhikshus to be liberated at Deer Park. "Known" (*A Ruo*) confirmed by Buddha's three questions.

**[323] 觀心者，空觀是般若，假觀是解脫，中觀是法身。又觀心者，從假入空，觀亦有三義，乃至中道觀，殺無明賊，不生二乘心，供養此人如供養世尊。**  
Interpretation via Contemplation of Mind:
- The Empty Contemplation is Prajñā (Wisdom).
- The Provisional Contemplation is Liberation (*Vimokṣa* - *Jie Tuo*).
- The Middle Contemplation is the Dharma Body (*Dharmakāya*).
Also via Contemplation of Mind: From the Provisional entering the Empty, the contemplation also has three meanings [Mendicant, Destroyer, Frightener]; up to the Middle Way Contemplation, which kills the Thief of Ignorance, is Not Born into the mind of the Two Vehicles, and offering to this person [who contemplates thus] is like offering to the World Honored One.

**《方等》云：「供佛及文殊，不如施行方等者一食充軀。」下文云：「毀讚佛罪福輕，毀讚持經者罪福重。」何者？佛無食想，久離八風不為損益；施持經者，全肉身、續報命、生法身、增慧命，故有益；毀之，憂惱退悔，若失好時則不可救，故大損(云云)。**  
The *Vaipulya* [Sutras] say: "Offering to the Buddha and Manjushri is not as good as giving one meal to nourish the body of one who practices the *Vaipulya*."
The text below [*Lotus Sutra*] says: "The sin or merit of slandering or praising the Buddha is light; the sin or merit of slandering or praising the Sutra-Holder is heavy."
Why is this? The Buddha has no conception of food and has long departed from the Eight Winds; he is not affected by loss or gain. Giving to the Sutra-Holder makes the fleshy body whole, continues the retribution-life, generates the Dharma-Body, and increases the Wisdom-Life; therefore there is benefit. Slandering him causes worry and affliction, retrogression and regret; if the "Good Time" is lost, it cannot be salvaged; therefore there is great loss (etc.).

**[325] 四、歎德，文有五句歎上三德。《法華論》云：「初句總，後句別。」當知諸句皆歎羅漢句耳。**  
4. **Praise of Virtue**: The text has five phrases praising the Three Virtues [of the Arhat above]. The *Lotus Sutra Treatise* says: "The first phrase is general; the latter phrases are specific." You should know these are all phrases praising the Arhat.

**[327] 「諸漏已盡，無復煩惱」，此兩句歎上殺賊。漏者三漏也，《成論》云：「失道故名漏。」律云：「癡人造業，開諸漏門。」毘曇云：「漏落生死。」論、律語異而同明漏義。**  
"**All Outflows Already Exhausted**" (*Zhu Lou Yi Jin*), "**No Further Afflictions**" (*Wu Fu Fan Nao*): These two phrases praise the [Arhat quality of] "Killer of Thieves."
"Outflows" (*Asrava*) refer to the Three Outflows [Sensual Desire, Existence, Ignorance].
- The *Satyasiddhi Sastra* says: "Losing the Path is named Leak/Outflow."
- The *Vinaya* says: "The deluded person creates karma, opening the gates of all Outflows."
- The *Abhidharma* says: "Leaking/Falling into Birth and Death."
The language of the Treatises vs. Vinaya differs, but they clarify the meaning of "Leak" identically.

**良由賊誑失於理寶，貧窮孤露造諸惡[6]業、致生死苦，亡法身、失慧命、喪重寶，皆是賊義。不應謂是不生義歎德也。煩惱者，即九十八使，流扼纏蓋等逼惱行人。煩惱是能潤，漏業是所潤，能所既盡，正是殺賊義，那得作不生歎耶？**  
It is purely because of the deception of the "Thief" that one loses the Treasure of Principle, becomes destitute and exposed, creates evil karma, and incurs the suffering of Birth and Death. The death of the Dharma Body, the loss of Wisdom Life, the forfeiture of the Heavy Treasure—these are all meanings of "Thief." It should not be said that this praises the virtue of "No Birth."
"Afflictions" (*Klesha*) are the 98 Drivers (*Anusaya*), the Currents, Yokes, Bonds, and Coverings that oppress/afflict the practitioner. Affliction is the "Moistener" (*Neng Run*); Leaking Karma is the "Moistened" (*Suo Run*). Since both the Agent [Moistener] and Object [Moistened] are exhausted, this specifically is the meaning of "**Killer of Thieves**." How could it be taken as a praise of "No Birth"?

**[331] 「逮得己利」一句，是歎應供，三界因果皆名為他，智斷功德皆名己利，己利具足故成應供。**  
"**Attained Self-Benefit**" (*Dai De Ji Li*)—this single phrase praises "**Worthy of Offerings**." The causes and effects of the Triple World are all named "Other" (*Ta*). The merits of Wisdom and Severance are all named "Self-Benefit." Because Self-Benefit is complete, one becomes "Worthy of Offerings."

**[333] 「盡諸有結，心得自在」兩句，是歎不生。諸有即二十五有，生處也；結即二十五有，生因也。因盡果亡，歎不生明矣！不應作殺賊歎也。**  
"**Exhausted all Bonds of Existence**" (*Jin Zhu You Jie*), "**The Mind Attained Sovereignty/Freedom**" (*Xin De Zi Zai*): These two phrases praise "**No Birth**."
- "All Existences" (*Zhu You*) are the Twenty-Five Existences [realms of rebirth], the Place of Birth.
- "Bonds" (*Jie*) are the Causes of Birth in the Twenty-Five Existences.
Since the Cause [Bonds] is exhausted and the Fruit [Existence] is gone, it clearly praises "No Birth"! It should not be taken as a praise of "Killing Thieves."

**羅漢但應結盡，未應有[7]盡；有盡者，因中說果，又盡在不久也。**  
[Objection:] The Arhat should only have "Bonds Exhausted" [Cause removed], not necessarily "Existence Exhausted" [since they still have a body?].
[Answer:] "Existence Exhausted" is speaking of the Fruit whilst in the Cause; also, the exhaustion [of the body] will be soon (*in a short time*).

**[337] 「心得自在」者，定具足名心自在，慧具足名慧自在，慧自在未必心自在，心自在必慧自在。今言心自在，即是定、慧具足俱解脫人，俱解脫人生決定盡，驗知歎不生德也。**  
Regarding "**Mind Attained Sovereignty**":
- Completeness of Samadhi is named **Mind Sovereignty** (*Ceto-vaśitā*? *Xin Zi Zai*).
- Completeness of Wisdom is named **Wisdom Sovereignty** (*Prajñā-vaśitā*).
Wisdom Sovereignty does not necessarily imply Mind Sovereignty [e.g., Wisdom-Liberated Arhats without high dhyanas]. Mind Sovereignty *must* imply Wisdom Sovereignty.
Now speaking of "Mind Sovereignty," this refers to people of **Double Liberation** (*Ubhayatobhāgavimukta*) who possess both Samadhi and Wisdom. A person of Double Liberation has "Birth Decisively Exhausted." This verifies it praises the virtue of "**No Birth**."

**若依《法華論》者，呼為上上起門，則是以後釋前也。論云：「以諸漏盡故名羅漢，以心得自在故名有結盡。」如是傳傳釋上也。**  
If relying on the *Lotus Sutra Treatise*, it calls this the "Upper-Upper Arising Gate," which explains the former via the latter. The *Treatise* says: "Because all outflows are exhausted, they are named Arhats; because the mind attains sovereignty, they are named [those with] Bonds of Existence Exhausted." Thus it sequentially explains the above.

**[339] 本迹者，不生不生名大涅槃，煩惱漏流其源久竭，不復墮落二乘及凡夫地，即本不生。法身智斷實相功德，名本己利；得王三昧破二十五有，顯出我性具八自在我，名本殺賊。迹示二乘功德耳。**  
Origin and Trace:
- "Not Born into Non-Birth" (*Bu Sheng Bu Sheng*) is named Great Nirvana. The source of the leakage-flow of afflictions dried up long ago; one does not fall again into the ground of the Two Vehicles or Common Mortals; this is the **Original No Birth**.
- The Real Characteristic Merit of the Dharma Body's Wisdom and Severance is named **Original Self-Benefit**.
- Attaining the [Lion's] Roar Samadhi [or King Samadhi?] to destroy the Twenty-Five Existences, revealing the Self-Nature possessing the Eight Sovereign Selves, is named **Original Killer of Thieves**.
The Trace simply displays the merits of the Two Vehicles.

**[341] 觀心者，中道正觀不漏落空、假二邊，二邊煩惱滅也，能觀心性名為上定，衣珠祕藏是己之物即己利也，正觀中道結[1]賊則斷，無結故有亦斷，二邊不能縛心故名自在，雖有煩惱如無煩惱，不斷煩惱而入涅槃即其義也。**  
Interpretation via Contemplation of Mind:
- The Middle Way Correct Contemplation does not "Leak" or fall into the Two Extremes of Empty and Provisional; the afflictions of the Two Extremes are extinguished.
- Able to contemplate the Mind-Nature is named "Superior Samadhi." The Hidden Store of the Jewel in the Robe is one's own possession, thus "**Self-Benefit**."
- Correctly contemplating the Middle Way, the Thief of Bonds is cut off. Because there are no Bonds, Existence is also cut off. Since the Two Extremes cannot bind the mind, it is named "**Sovereignty**."
- "Although possessing afflictions, it is as if no afflictions"; "Entering Nirvana without cutting off afflictions" (*Vimalakirti*)—this is precisely the meaning.

**[345] 五、列名，略舉二十一尊者，佛諸弟子皆備眾行，而隱其圓能各從一德標名者，欲引偏好故。**  
5. **Listing Names**: Briefly citing 21 Venerables. The Buddha's disciples all possess the multitude of practices completely. However, concealing their Perfect Capability and marking their names each from a single virtue is for the sake of attracting [beings with] partial preferences.

**《增一阿含》云：「憍陳如比丘，皆共上座名者，有德大人相隨，舍利弗共智慧深利者相隨，目連共神通大力者相隨。」皆掌一法，引諸偏好意也。若欲消名須識其行，從德立號無往不通也。一一羅漢例作四釋(云云)。**  
The *Ekottara Agama* says: "The Bhikshu Kauṇḍinya was always accompanied by elders of renown and virtuous great men; Śāriputra was accompanied by those of profound sharp wisdom; Maudgalyāyana was accompanied by those of great spiritual power." Each governed one Dharma to attract those of partial preferences. If one desires to explain the names, one must recognize their practice. Establishing a Title based on Virtue is universally applicable. Each Arhat is analyzed via the Four Interpretations [Teachings] (etc.).

**[347] 「憍陳如」，姓也，此翻火器，婆羅門種，其先事火，從此命族。火有二義：照也、燒也。照則闇不生，燒則物不生，此以不生為姓。**  
"**Kauṇḍinya**" (*Jiao Chen Ru*) is a surname. It translates as "**Fire Vessel**" (*Huo Qi*). He was of the Brahman caste; his ancestors served fire, and the clan was named from this. Fire has two meanings: Illumination and Burning. If iterating, darkness does not arise (*Bu Sheng*). If burning, things do not arise. This takes "**No Birth**" as a surname.

**「阿若」者，名也，此翻已知，或言無知，無知者非無所知也，乃是知無耳，若依二諦即是知真，以無生智為名也。**  
"**Ajñāta**" (*A Ruo*) is a name. It translates as "**Already Known**" (*Yi Zhi*), or sometimes says "**No Knowledge**" (*Wu Zhi*). "No Knowledge" does not mean knowing nothing; it means **Knowing the Nothingness** (*Zhi Wu* - Knowing Non-Existence). Relying on the Two Truths, this is **Knowing the True**. It takes the Wisdom of No Birth as a name.

**《無量壽》、《文殊問》、《阿毘曇》、《婆沙》皆稱為了本際、知本際，若依四諦即是知滅，而諸經多名為無知，或翻為得道。**  
The *Immeasurable Life Sutra*, *Manjushri's Inquiry*, *Abhidharma*, and *Vibhasha* all call him "**Understanding the Original Limit**" (*Liao Ben Ji*) or "**Knowing the Original Limit**." If relying on the Four Truths, this is **Knowing Extinction** (*Zhi Mie*). Yet many Sutras name him "No Knowledge" (*Wu Zhi*), or translate it as "Attained the Way."

**《增一阿含》云：「我佛法中寬仁博識，初受法味者，拘隣如比丘第一。」故以阿若為名也。**  
The *Ekottara Agama* says: "In my Buddha Dharma, among those of broad benevolence and vast learning, the first to receive the flavor of the Dharma is the Bhikshu Kauṇḍinya." Therefore he is named *Ajñāta* [The One Who Has Understood].

**願者，佛昔於饑世，化為赤目大魚，閉氣不喘示為死相，木工五人先斧斫魚肉，佛時誓言：「於當來世先度此等。」先願與其無生，故云阿若。**  
[Regarding Vows:] Long ago in a famine age, the Buddha transformed into a Red-Eyed Great Fish. Holding his breath and not panting, he manifested the appearance of death. Five carpenters first chopped the fish meat with axes. The Buddha at that time vowed: "In the future age I will deliver these people first." The prior vow gave them No-Birth; thus called *Ajñāta*.

**又迦葉佛時，九人學道，五人未得果，誓於釋迦法中最先開悟，本願所牽，前得無生，故名阿若。**  
Also, at the time of Kāśyapa Buddha, nine people studied the Way. Five did not attain the Fruit. They vowed to be the very first to open to awakening in the Dharma of Śākyamuni. Pulled by their original vows, they attained No-Birth first; thus named *Ajñāta*.

**行者，智生惑滅智斷行也。夫巨夜長寢無人能覺，日光未出明星前現，憍陳如比丘，初得無生智，譬若明星在眾明之始，一切人智明無前陳如，故名阿若。最先破闇莫過明星，陳如亦爾，一切人闇滅無前陳如，故名阿若。**  
[Regarding Practice:] Wisdom arises and Delusion is extinguished; this is the practice of Wisdom and Severance. The Great Night of long sleep, no one can awaken. Before the sunlight comes out, the Morning Star appears first. The Bhikshu Kauṇḍinya first attained the Wisdom of No-Birth, just as the Morning Star is at the beginning of the multitude of brightnesses. Among the wisdom-brightness of all people, none is before Kauṇḍinya; thus named *Ajñāta*. Nothing surpasses the Morning Star in first breaking the darkness; Kauṇḍinya is also like this. Among the extinction of darkness for all people, none is before Kauṇḍinya; thus named *Ajñāta*.


### Protocol Map: Fascicle 1 (Lines 351-380)
1.  **Tripitaka Teaching (San Zang Jiao):**
    -   **Metaphor:** Blind Man holding a Mirror (*Mang Pi Wu Sheng Zhi*).
    -   **Analysis:**
        -   *Mirror* = Truth of No-Birth (Nirvana).
        -   *Head/Face* = Present Cause (Six Parts).
        -   *Image* = Future Fruit.
        -   *Blind Man* = Ignorance/Attachment.
    -   **Process:** Opening eyes (attachment) = Seeing Image (Birth). Closing eyes (wisdom) = Not Seeing Image (No Birth).
    -   **Sutra Citation:** *Agama* "If one says there is Form... that is Birth."
    -   **Contemplation of Entrances/Realms:**
        -   *Eye* = Ocean. *Form* = Waves. *Love* = Whirlpool. *Evil Thoughts* = Fish/Dragons. *Jealousy* = Male Rakshasa. *Attachment* = Female Ghost.
        -   *Dependent Origination of Suffering:* Ignorance -> Action -> Consciousness -> ... -> Old Age/Death. "This is Birth, not No-Birth."
    -   **Definition of No-Birth:** Not planting seeds of suffering, not generating sprouts of suffering, etc.
2.  **Shared Teaching (Tong Jiao):**
    -   **Metaphor:** Illusionist holding an Illusory Mirror (*Huan Ren Zhi Huan Jing*).
    -   **Analysis:**
        -   *Image* is not born from Mirror, Face, Union, or Separation (Four Negations).
        -   *Nature:* Originally No-Birth (*Xing Ben Wu Sheng*).
    -   **Contemplation:**
        -   View Form like Mirror Image, Feeling like Bubble, Conception like Heat Haze, Volition like Plantain, Consciousness like Illusion.
        -   *Four Negations applied to Illusion:* Not from Illusion Object, not from Illusionist, etc.
        -   *Conclusion:* "No Birth and No Extinction, therefore called No Birth."

**[355] 三藏教者，盲譬無生智，鏡譬無生境，陰、入、界也，頭等六分譬現在因也，像譬未來果也。若開眼取鏡，形對像生，愚故不斷絕；若閉眼如盲，則無所見。不見六分是因不生，不見鏡像是果不生，**  
Regarding the **Tripitaka Teaching** [interpretation of Kauṇḍinya's "No Birth"]:
- The **Blind Man** metaphorically represents the Wisdom of No-Birth.
- The **Mirror** metaphorically represents the Realm of No-Birth (Nirvana).
- The Skandhas, Entrances, and Realms [of the person]—the Head and other Six Parts [of the body]—metaphorically represent the **Present Cause**.
- The **Image** [in the mirror] metaphorically represents the **Future Fruit**.
If one opens their eyes and takes the mirror, when the form faces it, the image is born. Because of foolishness, they do not cut this off.
If one closes their eyes like a blind man, one sees nothing. Not seeing the Six Parts [Head etc.] means the **Cause is Not Born**. Not seeing the Mirror Image means the **Fruit is Not Born**.

**故《阿含經》云：「若謂有色，色是淨，淨即生，非不生；若謂有受想行識，識是淨，淨即生，非不生；若謂有受，受是樂，樂即生，非不生；乃至色，色是樂，樂是生，非不生；若計有想行，行是我，我是生，非不生；乃至色，色是我，我是生，非不生；若計有識，識是常，常是生，非不生，乃至色，色是常，常是生非不生。」**  
Therefore the *Agama Sutra* says:
"If one says there is Form, and Form is Pure—Purity is Birth, not No-Birth."
"If one says there is Feeling, Conception, Volition, Consciousness, and Consciousness is Pure—Purity is Birth, not No-Birth."
"If one says there is Feeling, and Feeling is Happiness—Happiness is Birth, not No-Birth."
(Up to Form: If Form is Happiness, Happiness is Birth, not No-Birth.)
"If one calculates there is Conception or Volition, and Volition is Self—Self is Birth, not No-Birth."
(Up to Form: If Form is Self, Self is Birth, not No-Birth.)
"If one calculates there is Consciousness, and Consciousness is Permanent—Permanence is Birth, not No-Birth."
(Up to Form: If Form is Permanent, Permanence is Birth, not No-Birth.)

**譬如執鏡見面，面是生，非不生，若謂有五陰，悉是生，非不生，若能知色非淨乃至識非常，又能知色無常、苦、空、不淨，乃至識無常、苦、無我、不淨者，是為不生，非是生。如盲執鏡不見像生，是為不生，非是生。既知不生，寧復於中計我是色，計我異色，我在色中，色在我中？乃至識亦如是。如是觀者，現因來果俱皆不生，如盲對鏡不見形像，是名觀陰無生觀智也。**  
For example, holding a mirror and seeing the face—the face is Birth, not No-Birth. If one says there are Five Skandhas, all are Birth, not No-Birth.
If one can know Form is not Pure... up to Consciousness is not Permanent; and also know Form is Impermanent, Suffering, Empty, Impure... up to Consciousness is Impermanent, Suffering, Non-Self, Impure—**This is No-Birth, not Birth.**
Like a blind man holding a mirror seeing no image born—this is No-Birth, not Birth.
Since knowing No-Birth, how could one again calculate within it that "**Self is Form**," or "**Self is different from Form**," or "**Self is in Form**," or "**Form is in Self**"? Up to Consciousness, it is also thus.
Contemplating like this, the Present Cause and Future Fruit are both Not Born. Like a blind man facing a mirror seeing no form or image. This is named the Contemplative Wisdom of the No-Birth of the Skandhas.

**[357] 觀入、界者，凡言海者，雖復深廣亦有此彼岸，蓋小水耳；若眼見色已，愛念[7]染著貪樂，起身、口、意業者，是為大海，沈沒一切世間天、人、修羅。**  
Regarding Contemplating Entrances (*Ayatanas*) and Realms (*Dhatus*): generally when speaking of the "Ocean," although it is deep and broad, it still has a "this shore" and "that shore"—it is merely small water.
If the Eye sees Form, and one gives rise to thoughts of love, defiled attachment, and greedy pleasure, initiating karma of Body, Speech, and Mind—**This is the Great Ocean**. It drowns all worldlings, Devas, Humans, and Asuras.

**當知眼是大海，色是濤波，[8]愛此色故是洄澓，於中起不善覺是惡魚龍，起妬害是男羅[9]剎，起染愛是女鬼，起身、口、意是飲[10]醎自沒，是為[11]眼色無知而生無明愛，愛生故名為行；行生故名為業，業縛識入中陰，是為識生；**  
You should know:
- The **Eye** is the Great Ocean.
- **Form** is the Billowing Waves.
- **Loving** this Form is the Whirlpool.
- Arising Unwholesome Perceiving in its midst is the Evil Fish/Dragon.
- Arising Jealousy/Harm is the Male Rakshasa.
- Arising Defiled Love is the Female Ghost (*Rāksasī*).
- Arising Body, Speech, Mind [actions] is Drinking the Salt Water and self-drowning.
This is because of the Eye and Form having No-Knowledge (*Avidya*), generating Ignorant Craving (*Trsna*). Because Craving is born, it is named Volitional Formation (*Samskara*). Because Formation is born, it is named Karma. Karma binds Consciousness to enter the Intermediate State (*Antarabhāva*); this is named **Consciousness Born**.

**所受胞胎五疱未成，是為名色生；五疱成已名六入生；六入未能別苦樂，名為觸生；別苦樂名受生；於塵起染名愛生；四方馳求名取生；造身、口、意名有生；應受未來五陰，名生生；未來陰變名老生，未來陰壞名死生，心中內熱名憂生，發聲大喚名悲生，身心[1]顦悸名苦惱生。是名眼見色時即有三世十二因緣大苦聚生，非不生。**  
- Receiving the womb when the five bubbles (*kalala* etc.) are not yet formed is named **Name-and-Form Born**.
- When the five bubbles are formed, it is **Six Entrances Born**.
- Six Entrances not yet distinguishing pain/pleasure is **Contact Born**.
- Distinguishing pain/pleasure is **Feeling Born**.
- Arising defilement upon dusts is **Craving Born**.
- Running and seeking in four directions is **Grasping Born**.
- Creating Body/Speech/Mind [karma] is **Becoming Born**.
- Responding to receive future Five Skandhas is **Birth Born**.
- Future Skandhas changing is **Old Age Born**.
- Future Skandhas destroyed is **Death Born**.
- Inner heat in the heart is **Worry Born**.
- Emitting loud cries is **Grief Born**.
- Body and mind scorched/palpitating is **Suffering/Lamentation Born**.
This is named: When the Eye sees Form, naturally the Great Mass of Suffering of the Three Times and Twelve Links of Dependent Origination is **Born**, not Not-Born.
Ear, Nose, Tongue, Body, Mind; Eye Realm up to Dharma Realm—are also like this. This is "Entrance/Realm Born," not Not-Born.

**[367] 云何不生？觀眼色時，不種苦種，不生苦[3]芽，不漏臭汁，不集[4]蛆蠅，若種不生則[＊3-1]芽不生，則臭汁不生，則[＊4-1]蛆蠅不生，故名不生。**  
What is **No-Birth**? When contemplating Eye and Form:
- Not planting the Seed of Suffering.
- Not generating the Sprout of Suffering.
- Not leaking Stinking Juices.
- Not gathering Maggots and Flies.
If the Seed is not born, the Sprout is not born. If Sprout not born, Stinking Juice not born. If Juice not born, Maggots/Flies not born. Therefore named **No-Birth**.

**云何苦種？眼見色時起貪恚覺是為苦種，念於五欲法是生苦[＊3-2]芽，六根取六塵是名臭汁流出，於六塵中善惡競起是名[＊4-2]蛆蠅，若知眼色無常、苦、空、無我，則貪恚不生、念欲不生、取境不生、善惡行不生，是為不生；耳、鼻、舌、身、意亦如是，是眼界乃至法界亦如是。阿若最初得此三藏不生智故，名阿若憍陳[5]如。**  
What is the Seed of Suffering?
- When Eye sees Form, arising Greed/Anger perception—this is the **Seed of Suffering**.
- Mindfulness of the Five Desires—this is generating the **Sprout of Suffering**.
- Six Roots grasping Six Dusts—this is named **Stinking Juice Flowing Out**.
- Inside Six Dusts, Good and Evil [karma] contendingly arising—this is named **Maggots and Flies**.
If one knows Eye/Form are Impermanent, Suffering, Empty, Non-Self, then Greed/Anger not born; Desire not born; Grasping not born; Good/Evil Action not born. **This is No-Birth.**
Ear... up to Mind; Eye Realm... up to Dharma Realm are also thus.
Because Ajñāta was the very first to attain this **Tripitaka No-Birth Wisdom**, he is named Ajñāta Kauṇḍinya.

**[377] 通教無生觀，譬如幻人執幻鏡，以幻六分臨幻鏡、覩幻像，像非鏡生、非面生，非鏡面合生，非離鏡面生，既不從四句生，則非內外中間，不常自有亦無滅處，去不至東西南北方，性本無生，非滅生無生，性本無滅，非滅滅無滅，無生無滅故曰無生；受想行識亦復如是。**  
**Shared Teaching No-Birth Contemplation**:
Like an **Illusory Man** holding an **Illusory Mirror**. Using illusory Six Parts [Face/Head] facing the illusory mirror, observing the illusory image.
- The Image is not born from the Mirror.
- Not born from the Face.
- Not born from the Union of Mirror and Face.
- Not born Separately from Mirror and Face.
Since it is not born from the Four Phrases (*Catuskoti*), it is not Inside, Outside, or in the Middle. It does not exist permanently of itself, nor does it have a place of extinction. Going, it does not arrive at East, West, North, or South.
**Nature is Originally No-Birth** (*Xing Ben Wu Sheng*); it is not [a case of] extinguishing birth to [attain] No-Birth.
**Nature is Originally No-Extinction**; it is not [a case of] extinguishing extinction to [attain] No-Extinction.
Because of No-Birth and No-Extinction, it is called **No-Birth**.
Feeling, Conception, Volition, Consciousness are also like this.

**又觀幻色如幻鏡像、觀受如泡、觀想如炎、觀行如芭蕉、觀識如幻... (略)**  
Also contemplating Illusory Form like an illusory mirror image; Feeling like a bubble; Conception like heat-haze; Volition like a plantain; Consciousness like an illusion.
Illusion is not born from illusory objects, nor from the illusionist, not from union... (etc.).
Contemplating the Roots/Dusts... up to "No Ignorance"... up to "No Old Age/Death"... as a Wheel of Fire. Contemplating their **Fundamental Non-Existence** (*Ben Wu*). This is the intent of the Shared Teaching (etc.).


### Protocol Map: Fascicle 1 (Lines 381-410)
1.  **Distinct Teaching (*Bie Jiao*):**
    -   **Metaphor:** Mirror = Dharma Realm. Eye = Observation Wisdom.
    -   **Colors of Karma:** Blue (Hell), Yellow (Ghost), Red (Animal), White (Human/Deva).
    -   **Shapes of Karma:** Small (Two Vehicles), Large (Shared Bodhisattva), Short (Distinct Bodhisattva), Long (Buddha).
    -   **Process:** Distinguishing all clearly. Causing 9 Causes/Fruits NOT to proceed, 1 Cause/Fruit to proceed.
    -   **Method:** Analytic Contemplation (4 Abodes), Heng-Sha Buddha Dharma (Guest Dust), Real Mark Wisdom (Ignorance/Root).
    -   **Result:** No Fragmentary Birth, No Transformational Birth, No Real Retribution Birth. "Birth is also Not Born."
2.  **Perfect Teaching (*Yuan Jiao*):**
    -   **Metaphor:** Contemplating the Mirror as Round/Perfect (*Tuan Yuan*). Not observing back/front/image.
    -   **Method:** Not taking shapes/colors (Good/Evil, Defiled/Pure). Only contemplating the Roundness. No Boundaries, No Beginning/End.
    -   **Integration:** All neutralized (*Min*). Only conditional upon Real Mark (*Shi Xiang*). Form/Scent = Real Mark.
    -   **Conclusion:** Affliction/Karma/Birth = No Birth. "No Birth is Not Born." The three (Affliction, Karma, Suffering) are the three (Prajna, Liberation, Dharma Body).
3.  **Origin/Trace of Kauṇḍinya:**
    -   *Origin:* Originally Dwelling in the "Letter A" (*A Zi Men* - *Ajatā*). All dharmas originally unborn.
    -   *Trace:* Manifesting Milk -> Cream -> Curds -> Butter -> Ghee (Five Flavors). Kauṇḍinya represents the *First Teaching* (Milk/Deer Park).
    -   *Note:* Realizing "Perfect No Birth" makes one equal to Ajñāta (Known).
4.  **Mahākāśyapa (Mo He Jia Ye):**
    -   *Surname:* **Kāśyapa** = Great Turtle Clan (*Da Gui Shi*). Ancestors learned Diagram on Turtle Back.
    -   *Surname:* **Light Wave / Drinking Light** (*Guang Bo / Yin Guang*). Body light swallows other lights.
    -   *Name:* **Pippala** (Tree name). Parents prayed to tree for child.
    -   *Biography:* Rich family (Kapila/Dhana). Wife Bhadra Kapilani. Golden skin (91 kalpas of merit from repairing stupa). 30 Marks (missing two).
    -   *Three Greats:*
        1.  **Great Renunciation (*She Da*):** Gave up immense wealth (1000x King Bimbisara), beautiful wife.
        2.  **Great Acceptance (*Shou Da*):** Received Buddha's "Rag Robe" (Dharma succession).
        3.  **Great Practice (*Xing Da*):** Dhuta practices (asceticism).

**[387] [7]別觀無生智者，鏡譬法界，眼譬觀智，青黃赤白、小大長短譬十法界，青譬地獄因果，黃譬餓鬼因果，赤譬畜生因果，白譬人天因果，**  
**Distinct Teaching No-Birth Wisdom:**
- The **Mirror** metaphors the Dharma Realm.
- The **Eye** metaphors Observational Wisdom.
- Blue, Yellow, Red, White, Small, Large, Short, Long metaphor the Ten Dharma Realms.
    - Blue metaphors Hell Cause/Fruit. Yellow: Hungry Ghost. Red: Animal. White: Human/Deva.
    - Small forms: Two Vehicles. Large: Shared Bodhisattva. Short: Distinct Bodhisattva. Long: Buddha.
Understanding all distinctions in the mirror without error.

**小色像譬二乘因果，大色像譬通菩薩因果，短色像譬別菩薩因果，長色像譬佛因果，皆於鏡中分別無謬。若欲自正，令九因果不生、一因果生；若欲正他，令他九因果不生、一因果生。**  
If desiring to correct oneself: Cause the Nine Causes/Fruits *not* to be born; cause the One [Buddha] Cause/Fruit to be born.
If desiring to correct others: Cause their Nine Causes/Fruits not to be born; cause the One Cause/Fruit to be born.

**依於法界行[8]菩提行，次第用析體觀智，斷四住生令不生；次用恒沙佛法斷客塵煩惱，令無知不生；後用實相智慧斷無明，令根本不生。若無四住則分段不生，若無無知則方便不生，若無無明則實報不生，生亦不生，不生亦不生，故名不生，是名別教無生智也。**  
Relying on the Dharma Realm to practice Bodhi conduct:
1.  Sequentially use Analytic/Empty Contemplative Wisdom to cut off the Four Abodes [of Views/Thoughts], causing them **Not to be Born**.
2.  Next use Sands-of-Ganges Buddha Dharmas to cut off Guest-Dust Afflictions, causing No-Knowledge (*Wu Zhi*) **Not to be Born**.
3.  Later use Real Characteristic Wisdom to cut off Ignorance, causing the Root **Not to be Born**.
If there are no Four Abodes, then Fragmentary Birth is not born. If no No-Knowledge, then Transformational Birth is not born. If no Ignorance, then Real Retribution Birth is not born.
"Birth is also Not Born; Not-Born is also Not Born." Therefore named **No-Birth**. This is the **Distinct Teaching No-Birth Wisdom**.

**[392] 約圓教觀無生智者，觀鏡團圓，不觀背面、不觀形像，非背非闇、非面非明，不取種種形容、不取種種檠像，但觀團圓，無際畔、無始終、無明闇、無一異差別者，譬於圓觀，不取十法界相貌，**  
**Perfect Teaching No-Birth Wisdom:**
Contemplate the Mirror as **Round and Perfect** (*Tuan Yuan*). Do not contemplate the back or face; do not contemplate the forms/images. It is not Back/Dark, not Face/Bright. Do not grasp various forms or appearances.
Only contemplate the **Roundness/Perfection**: no boundaries, no beginning/end, no dark/light, no difference of one/many.
This metaphors the **Perfect Contemplation**: It does not take the characteristics/appearances of the Ten Dharma Realms.

**無善惡、無邪正、無小大等，一切皆泯，但緣諸法實相，法性佛法，若色若香無非實相，觀煩惱業生即無生，無生不生，故曰無生，陰、入、界苦即是法身，非顯現故名為法身，障即法身，貪、恚、癡即般若，非能明故名為般若，[9]無所可照性自明了，業行繫縛皆名解脫，非斷縛得脫，亦無體可繫，亦無能繫，故稱解脫。**  
No Good/Evil, no Deviant/Correct, no Small/Large. All are obliterated (*Min*). Only conditional upon the **Real Characteristic of All Dharmas**.
Regarding Dharma Nature and Buddha Dharma: "Be it Form or Scent, nothing is *not* the Middle Way / Real Characteristic."
Contemplate Affliction, Karma, and Birth as **precisely No-Birth**. "No-Birth is Not Born." Thus called No-Birth.
- The suffering of Skandhas/Entrances/Realms is precisely **Dharma Body**. Not because it is revealed [after destroying suffering], but named Dharma Body [in itself]. Obstruction *is* Dharma Body.
- Greed, Anger, Ignorance are precisely **Prajñā**. Not because they can illuminate, but named Prajñā; having nothing to illuminate, the Nature is self-illuminating.
- Karma, Action, Binding are all named **Liberation**. Not cutting off bonds to get liberation; there is no substance to be bound, nor agent to bind; thus called Liberation.

**解脫即業不生，般若即煩惱不生，法身即苦不生，是三不生即一不生，是一不生即三不生，非三非一故言不生，況變易煩惱業苦而非不生？此即圓無生觀智(云云)。**  
- Liberation = Karma Not Born.
- Prajñā = Affliction Not Born.
- Dharma Body = Suffering Not Born.
These Three Not-Borns are precisely One Not-Born. This One Not-Born is precisely Three Not-Borns. Not Three, Not One; thus called **No-Birth**.
How much more so are the Afflictions/Karma/Suffering of *Transformation* (*Pariṇāma*) also Not Born?
**This is the Perfect No-Birth Contemplative Wisdom.**

**[396] 本迹者，是憍陳如本自不生，非始不生；欲引乳為酪故，迹為初教不生；引酪為生蘇故，迹為通不生；引生為熟[10]故，迹為別不生；引熟為醍醐故，迹為圓不生。**  
**Origin and Trace**: This Kauṇḍinya is **Originally Self-Not-Born** (*Ben Zi Bu Sheng*), not "beginning to be" Not-Born.
- Desiring to draw out Milk to make Cream (*Luo* - Deer Park): Traces as the **First Teaching No-Birth**.
- Drawing Cream to make Curds (*Sheng Su*): Traces as **Shared No-Birth**.
- Drawing Curds to make Butter (*Shu Su*): Traces as **Distinct No-Birth**.
- Drawing Butter to make Ghee (*Ti Hu*): Traces as **Perfect No-Birth**.

**而其本地住阿字門，謂一切法初不生故。若聞阿字門，則解一切義皆非生非不生；垂迹引化，能為生不生。眾生若能會圓不生，則同阿若，非本非迹、非生非不生，[11]大事因緣於茲畢矣。**  
His Origin Stage dwells in the **Letter "A" Gate** (*A Zi Men* - *Ajatā*). That is, "All Dharmas are Originally Unborn."
If one hears the Letter A Gate, one understands all meanings are "Neither Born nor Not Born."
Manifesting Traces to guide and transform, he is capable of "Birth" and "No-Birth."
If sentient beings can realize the **Perfect No-Birth**, they are the same as **Ajñāta**. Neither Origin nor Trace; Neither Birth nor No-Birth. The **Great Matter of Causes and Conditions** is finished right here!

**[405] 「摩訶迦葉」，此翻大龜氏，其先代學道，靈龜負仙圖而應，從德命族故言龜氏。真諦三藏翻光波，古仙人身光炎踊，能映餘光使不現，故言光波。亦云飲光，迦葉身光亦能映物。**  
**Mahākāśyapa**:
- Translates as "**Great Turtle Clan**" (*Da Gui Shi*). His ancestors studied the Way; a numinous turtle bore a transcendent diagram in response. Named the clan from this virtue.
- Tripitaka Master Paramartha translates as "**Light Wave**" (*Guang Bo*). The ancient sage's body light blazed and leapt, able to outshine other lights making them invisible.
- Also called "**Drinking Light**" (*Yin Guang*). Kāśyapa's body light could "drink up" [overshadow] other things.

**名畢鉢羅，或畢鉢波羅延，或梯毘犁。畢鉢羅樹也，父母禱樹神求得此子，以樹名之。跋耆子生此聚落，人以為號，其家大富。**  
Name: **Pippala**. Or *Pippalāyana*. Or *Tibiruh*?
*Pippala* is a tree. Parents prayed to the tree spirit to get this child; named him by the tree.
Born in the village of *Mahātīrtha*? (*Ba Qi Zi*). People used it as a title. His family was extremely wealthy.

**《增一阿含》云：「羅閱祇大富長者，名迦毘羅，婦名檀[1]那，子名畢鉢羅，子婦名婆陀，其家千倍勝瓶沙王，十六大國無[2]以為隣。」**  
*Ekottara Agama* says: "In Rajgir, a great rich elder named Kapila (*Jia Pi Luo*). Wife named Dhana. Son named Pippala. Son's wife named Bhadra (*Po Tuo*). Their household was 1000 times superior to King Bimbisara. Among the 16 Great States, none could match it."

**《付法藏》言：「毘婆尸佛滅後，塔像金色缺壞，時有貧女匃得金珠，倩匠為薄。金師歡喜治瑩佛畢，立誓為夫婦。九十一劫人中天上身恒金色、心恒受樂...」**  
*Transmission of the Dharma Pitaka* says: "After Vipaśyin Buddha's extinction, a pagoda image's gold color was damaged. A poor woman begged and got a gold bead. Asked a craftsman to beat it into leaf. The goldsmith rejoiced; they repaired the Buddha image together. They vowed to be husband and wife. For 91 kalpas in heavens and humans, bodies always golden, minds always enjoying pleasure..." (Narrative of merit).

**捨此家業，又納金色婦迭臥無欲，捨而出家，身披無價寶衣，截為僧伽梨，四疊奉佛為座，如是三捨世無倫匹，是為捨大。於跋耆聚落，值佛奉寶衣，佛授糞掃大衣，此衣是大聖大衣，又不麁重，故迦葉云：「我受佛衣，師想、塔想，未曾頭枕，況以覆臥？如此大衣，大進我行。」故言受大。**  
He abandoned this family property. Also married the golden woman (Bhadra) but slept separately without desire. Abandoned [her] to leave home. His body wore priceless jeweled robes; he cut them to make a *Sanghati* (Patch Robe). Folded it four times to offer as a seat for the Buddha. Thus these **Three Abandonments** [Wealth, Wife, Robe] have no peer in the world; this is **Great Renunciation** (*She Da*).
In the village, he met the Buddha and offered the Jeweled Robe. The Buddha gave him the Rag Robe (*Pāṃśukūla*). This robe is the **Great Sage's Great Robe**, yet not coarse or heavy.
Therefore Kāśyapa said: "I received the Buddha's Robe. I hold the thought of Master, the thought of Stupa. I have never used it as a pillow for my head, much less to cover myself while sleeping. This Great Robe greatly advances my practice." Thus called **Great Acceptance** (*Shou Da*).


### Protocol Map: Fascicle 1 (Lines 411-440)
1.  **Mahākāśyapa's Three Greats (continued):**
    -   *Practice Great (Xing Da):* Foremost in 12 Dhuta practices. Even in old age, refused Buddha's offer to rest. Buddha praised him: "You are like me" (Four Dhyanas, Metta/Karuna, Six Powers, Four Samadhis).
    -   *Position Great (Wei Da):* Senior among 1250 disciples. Seat shared with Buddha. "Leader of the Sangha" (*Seng Zheng*).
        -   *Anecdotes:*
            -   **Brahmins & Shramanas:** Buddha says Kasyapa knows both laws equally.
            -   **Sakra's Welcome:** Indra drove the chariot for King Mandhata (past life); Buddha shares seat with Kasyapa (present).
            -   **Needle Seller:** Nun Thullananda critiqued Kasyapa teaching Ananda ("selling needles to the needle maker"). Kasyapa rebukes her (Moon/Sun metaphor).
2.  **Mahākāśyapa's Compilations:**
    -   *Tripitaka Compilation:* After Nirvana, compiled Sutra, Vinaya, Abhidharma.
    -   *Sengzhao's Preface:* "Citing the ultimate... restraining with precepts... guiding with Sutras... distinguishing marks with Abhidharma."
    -   *Agama Compilation:* Ekottara (Human/Deva), Dirgha (Breaking Views), Madhyama (Deep Meaning), Samyukta (Dhyana).
3.  **Transmission:**
    -   Buddha entrusted the Dharma to Kasyapa. (If Dhuta practitioners exist, the Dharma exists).
    -   **Kasyapa's Nirvana:** Climbed Mt. Kukkutapada, entered Diamond Samadhi, waiting for Maitreya.
4.  **Dhuta (Ascetic) Practices (Dou Sou):**
    -   *Etymology:* *Dhūta* = Shaking Off (*Dou Sou*). Shaking off 12 kinds of faults (e.g., attachment to clothes/food).
    -   **The 12 Practices:**
        -   *Clothing (2):* Rag Robe (*Pāṃśukūla*), Three Robes only (*Ticīvara*).
        -   *Food (1):* Begging Food (*Piṇḍapāta*), One Meal (*Ekāsanika*), No Juice after noon, Bowl only (*Pātrapiṇḍika*).
        -   *Residing (5):* Tree Root, Graveyard (*Śmāśānika*), Open Air (*Abhyavakāśika*), Sitting not Lying (*Naiṣadika*), Any Place (*Yāthāsaṃstarika*).
    -   **Tripitaka Analysis of Begging Food:**
        -   *Skandhas:* Joy/Sorrow from begging = Feeling/Conception...
        -   *Four Truths:*
            -   *Suffering:* 12 Entrances/3 Realms.
            -   *Accumulation:* Praise/Blame -> 10 Fetters (Greed, Anger, Ignorance, Arrogance, Doubt, Views).
            -   *Path:* Covering the 4 inversions (Self, Pleasure, Pure, Permanent). Cultivating 37 Limbs.
            -   *Cessation:* No Self -> No Ignorance... -> No 25 Existences.
        -   *Conclusion:* This is the "Shaking Off Contemplative Wisdom" (*Dou Sou Guan Hui*) of the Tripitaka.

**[416] 佛弟子中多名迦葉，如十力、三迦葉等，皆是大人；於諸同名中最長，故標大迦葉也。於跋耆聚落，初從佛聞增上戒、定、慧，即得無漏，受乞食法，行十二頭陀，逾老不捨，**  
Among the Buddha's disciples, many are named Kāśyapa (e.g., Daśabala Kāśyapa, the Three Kāśyapas). All are Great Men (*Mahāsattva*). Among those of the same name, he is the eldest, thus marked as **Mahā-Kāśyapa** (Great Kāśyapa).
In the Vajjian village (*Ba Qi Ju Luo*), he first heard the Adhi-Śīla, Adhi-Citta, and Adhi-Prajñā from the Buddha, and immediately attained the Outflow-Free state (*Anasrava*). He accepted the method of Begging Food and practiced the **Twelve Dhūtas** (*Tou Tuo*). Even when extremely old, he did not abandon them.

**後時佛語：「汝年高，可捨乞食，歸眾受食，可捨麁重糞掃衣，受壞色居士輕衣。」迦葉白佛：「佛不出世我當為辟支佛，終身行頭陀，我今不敢放所習更學餘者，又為當來世作明...」佛言：「善哉！」是為行大。**  
Later, the Buddha said: "You are advanced in years. You may abandon begging for food and accept food in the Sangha. You may abandon the coarse, heavy rag-robes and accept the light robes of householders turned to dyed colors."
Kāśyapa addressed the Buddha: "If the Buddha had not appeared in the world, I would have become a Pratyekabuddha and practiced Dhūta all my life. I dare not now let go of what I have practiced to learn other things. Also, I do this to be a light for the future world... saying 'The Elder Kāśyapa was praised by the Buddha; I too should practice difficult asceticism.'"
The Buddha said: "Excellent!" **This is Practice Great** (*Xing Da*).

**《增一阿含》：「...佛言：『吾有四禪...迦葉亦然；吾有大慈...汝亦如此；吾有大悲...汝亦如是；吾有四神三昧...汝亦如是；吾有六通...汝亦如是...』」**  
*Ekottara Legacy*: "The Buddha said: 'I possess the Four Dhyanas... Kāśyapa is also thus. I have Great Kindness (*Maitri*)... you are also thus. I have Great Compassion (*Karuna*)... you are also thus. I have Four Super-knowledges Samadhi... Six Penetrations... you are also thus.'" (The Buddha equates Kasyapa's powers with his own).

**《增一阿含》云：「一婆羅門白佛：『昨有婆羅門至我家，何者是？』佛指迦葉。又問：『此沙門，非婆羅門。』佛言：『沙門法律，婆羅門法律，我皆知，迦葉亦爾...』諸比丘聞佛所讚，心驚毛竪。」**  
*Ekottara* says: A Brahmin asked, "A Brahmin came to my house yesterday, which one was it?" Buddha pointed to Kasyapa. The man asked: "This is a Shramana, not a Brahmin." Buddha said: "The Shramana Code and the Brahmin Code—I know them all; Kasyapa is also thus." The Bhikshus' hair stood on end.

**佛引本因緣，昔有聖王號文陀竭，高才絕倫，天帝欽德，遣千馬車造闕迎王，天帝出候與王同坐...昔迦葉以生死座命吾同坐，吾今成佛以正法座報其往勳，對佛坐時天人咸謂佛師。**  
The Buddha cited a past cause: Long ago, a Sage King named Mandhata (*Wen Tuo Jie*). Indra admired his virtue, sent a chariot to welcome him, and **shared his seat** (*Tong Zuo*).
"In the past, Kāśyapa invited me to share his 'Birth and Death Seat'; now that I have become Buddha, I repay his past merit with the 'True Dharma Seat'." When he sat facing the Buddha, Devas and Humans all called him the "Buddha's Teacher."
(Narrative of the "Needle Seller" critique by Nun Thullananda and Kasyapa's rebuke omitted for brevity, identifying Kasyapa as clearly the senior).
**This is Position Great** (*Wei Da*).

**[422] 佛燒身後，灰場生四鉢多羅樹，此表迦葉集三僧祇劫法為三藏四阿含。僧肇序云：「宗極絕於稱謂，賢聖以之冲默...」...若別論集者，阿難誦出修多羅，優波離誦出毘尼，迦葉誦出阿毘曇，故言結集大也。**  
After the Buddha's body was cremated, four *Patra* trees grew at the ash-ground. This symbolizes Kāśyapa compiling the Dharma of three Asankhya kalpas into the **Tripitaka and Four Agamas**.
Reference to Sengzhao's Preface.
Specifically regarding compilation: Ananda recited the Sutras; Upali recited the Vinaya; **Kāśyapa recited the Abhidharma**. Thus called **Compilation Great**.

**[427] 如來去後法付迦葉，能為一切而作依止，猶如如來。何者？若有頭陀苦行人，我法則存...迦葉能荷負佛法令得久住...故言持法大。**  
After the Tathagata left, the Dharma was entrusted to Kāśyapa. He could be a reliance for all, just like the Tathagata. Why? "If there are Dhūta practitioners, my Dharma exists." Kāśyapa could shoulder the load of the Buddha Dharma causing it to abide long. Thus called **Upholding Dharma Great**.

**約教明抖擻，抖擻十二種過...二是衣法，六是食法，四是住處法。**  
Explaining **Dhūta** (*Dou Sou* - Shaking Off) according to the Teaching: Shaking off twelve kinds of faults. (Attachment to clothes, food, dwelling places).
- **Two Clothing Methods:** 1. Rag Robe (*Pāṃśukūla*). 2. Three Robes Only (*Ticīvara*).
- **Six Food Methods:** 1. Begging Food (*Piṇḍapāta*); 2. Ordered Begging; 3. No Food after Noon; 4. One Eating (*Ekāsanika*); 5. Modest Portion; 6. Bowl Only.
- **Four Dwelling Methods:** 1. Tree Root; 2. Open Ground; 3. Graveyard; 4. Sitting not lying (*Naiṣadika*).

**[436] 且約乞食明抖擻者...憂喜依色而起即色陰，受此憂喜即受陰...憂喜即意法二入三界，界入陰即苦諦...**  
**Analysing Begging Food as Shaking Off (Tripitaka):**
Begging is easy to produce Joy; hard to produce Anger.
- Joy/Sorrow rely on Form = **Form Skandha**.
- Receiving Joy/Sorrow = **Feeling Skandha**.
- (Thinking/Consciousness Skandhas follow).
Joy/Sorrow are Mind/Dharmas entering the Three Realms = **Truth of Suffering**.

**讚喜毀瞋我能被呵即疑不了為癡，是為十使，歷三界四諦，即八十八使名集諦。**  
Praise brings Joy, Blame brings Anger. "I am capable," "I am scolded." Doubt and Ignorance. These are the **Ten Fetters** (*Shi Shi*). Across the Three Realms/Four Truths, this is the **88 Fetters** (Defilements) named **Truth of Accumulation**.

**若識乞食中四倒相似相續覆故謂常...勤遮二惡、生二善，修四定根力覺道，是為道諦。於乞食中不計我則癡滅...是為滅諦。若於乞食中，不見四真諦，是故久流轉生死大苦海；若能見四諦，則得斷生死...是三藏頭陀也。**  
If one recognizes in Begging Food that the Four Inversions (Permanence, Pleasure, Self, Pure) are covering the truth... and diligently cultivates the **37 Limbs of Enlightenment** (Roots, Powers, Awakening Factors, Path)—this is the **Truth of the Path**.
In Begging Food: Not calculating a Self (Ignorance Extinguished) -> Craving Extinguished -> Anger Extinguished -> No Arrogance -> No Doubt -> No View.
Thus the 10 Fetters extinguish -> 88 Fetters extinguish -> Seed Binding extinguishes -> Fruit Binding extinguishes -> 25 Existences extinguish. This is the **Truth of Cessation**.
If one does not see the Four Truths in begging, one flows in Samsara. If one sees, one cuts off Samsara. **This is the Tripitaka Dhūta.**


### Protocol Map: Fascicle 1 (Lines 441-470)
1.  **Dhuta Interpretations (continued):**
    -   **Shared Teaching (*Tong Jiao*):** Dwelling = Witnessing Quiescence/Truth. Food = Empty Wisdom. Clothing = Empty Mind practicing deeds. "Empty Wisdom shakes off (Dhuta) all like illusions."
    -   **Distinct Teaching (*Bie Jiao*):** Dwelling = Dharma Body. Food = Prajna Wisdom. Clothing = All Conduct Adorning/Covering. Shaking off "Black Karma" (Precepts), "Affliction" (Prajna), "Samsara" (Dharma Body). Shaking off Fragmentary and Transformational suffering.
    -   **Perfect Teaching (*Yuan Jiao*):** Dwelling = Clothing = Food. One Dharma separates into three. "One Dhuta is All Dhutas." All implies Real Characteristic.
    -   **Origin/Trace:** Origin = Buddha and Kasyapa sharing the seat of Ultimate Emptiness, attaining Great Dharma Body/Wisdom. Trace = Manifesting the 5 Flavors of Dhuta (Milk to Ghee).
    -   **Contemplation:** Empty = Shaking off Marks. Provisional = Shaking off Dust/Sand. Middle = Shaking off Ignorance.
2.  **The Three Kāśyapas:**
    -   **Uruvilvā (*You Lou Pin Luo*):** Trans: "Papaya Forest" (*Mu Gua Lin*).
    -   **Nadī (*Na Ti*):** Trans: "River".
    -   **Gayā (*Jie Ye*):** Trans: "City" or "Elephant". Located 7 yojanas south of Rajgir.
    -   *Conversion:* Originally Fire Worshippers. Buddha performed 10 Miracles (Dragon Fire, Walking on Water, etc.). Uruvilva says: "Gautama is magical but my Way is True." Buddha rebukes: "You are not Arhat." He submits. 1000 disciples total.
    -   *Teaching Analysis:* Uruvilva (Milk/Tripitaka), Nadi (Cream), Gaya (Curds/Shared).
    -   *Origin/Trace:* Forest (Prajna), City (Dharma Body), Water (Liberation). Secret Treasury.
3.  **Śāriputra (*She Li Fu*):**
    -   *Name:* **Śāri** = Egret/Bird (*She Li*) or Body (*Shen*). **Putra** = Son (*Zi*).
    -   *Mother:* Wise eyes like the Śāri bird. Or beautiful body. "Named son after mother" -> Śāriputra.
    -   *Father:* **Tiṣya** (*Ti She*). "Named son after father" -> Upatisya (*You Po Ti She* - "Minor Tisya"?).
    -   *Jataka Tale (The Clever Thief):* Past life as a weaver/nephew. Stole King's treasure. Outwitted the King's guards (corpse substitution, burning dummy, hiding in water). King impressed, gave him the princess. This displays his "limitless wisdom."

**[442] 通教抖擻者，緣真證寂則是住處，空慧為食，空心行諸行為衣，常性空無不性空時，空慧抖擻皆如幻化，妄想諸惡寂滅不起，心心數法不行故，以不可得故，諸相應中空相應最為第一，諸苦行中空行第一，諸抖擻中空慧抖擻最為第一。略說竟。**  
**Shared Teaching Dhūta:**
- Conditioning upon Truth and witnessing Quiescence is the **Dwelling Place**.
- Empty Wisdom is **Food**.
- With Empty Mind practicing all conducts is **Clothing**.
Always Nature-Empty; there is no time when it is not Nature-Empty. Empty Wisdom shakes off (*Dou Sou*) all as if they were illusions/transformations. False thoughts and evils are extinguished and do not rise. Mind and mental factors do not operate, because they are ungraspable.
- Among all correspondences, **Empty Correspondence** is foremost.
- Among all ascetic practices, **Empty Practice** is foremost.
- Among all Dhūtas, **Empty Wisdom Dhūta** is foremost. (Brief explanation concluded).

**[444] 別教抖擻者，依於法身以為住處，般若智慧以為食，一切諸行莊嚴遮覆，遮覆抖擻黑業之惡，般若抖擻煩惱之惡，法身抖擻生死苦惡，前抖擻分段煩惱業苦，次抖擻變易煩惱業苦，是為中道正觀頭陀，出過二乘所行苦行(云云)。**  
**Distinct Teaching Dhūta:**
- Relying on the **Dharma Body** (*Dharmakaya*) as the **Dwelling Place**.
- **Prajñā Wisdom** as **Food**.
- All conducts adorning and covering—Covering shakes off the evil of Black Karma (Precepts).
- Prajñā shakes off the evil of **Affliction**.
- Dharma Body shakes off the evil of **Samsaric Suffering**.
First shaking off Fragmentary (*Parittas*) affliction/karma/suffering; next shaking off Transformational (*Parinama*) affliction/karma/suffering.
This is the **Middle Way Correct Contemplation Dhūta**, surpassing the asceticism practiced by the Two Vehicles.

**[446] 圓教抖擻者，住處即衣即食，但是一法分別說三，一抖擻一切抖擻，一切抖擻一抖擻，非一非一切，於一切抖擻無非實相，諸佛所行是如來行，過諸菩薩所行清淨(云云)。**  
**Perfect Teaching Dhūta:**
Dwelling Place *is* Clothing *is* Food. It is merely One Dharma discriminatively spoken as three.
**One Shaking-Off is All Shaking-Offs; All Shaking-Offs are One Shaking-Off.** Not One, not All.
Regarding all Dhūtas, none are not the **Real Characteristic**. This is the practice of all Buddhas, the Tathagata Practice, surpassing the pure practices of all Bodhisattvas.

**[448] 本迹者，本與如來同坐畢竟空理、同得廣大法身、同得無礙智慧、同得無量功德...欲引乳味事中抖擻，次引酪味空中抖擻，次引生蘇別中抖擻，次引熟蘇圓中抖擻。**  
**Origin and Trace:**
In the **Origin**, [Kasyapa] sat together with the Tathagata in the Principle of Ultimate Emptiness. Together attained vast Dharma Body, unobstructed Wisdom, and immeasurable Merit. Internally abandoning Dharma Love, externally without defilement. Internal/External Shaking-Off was originally already pure.
- Desiring to draw out Milk Flavor: [Traces] Phenomenal Dhūta.
- Next, Cream Flavor: Empty Dhūta.
- Next, Curds: Distinct Middle Dhūta.
- Next, Butter: Perfect Dhūta.

**[450] 觀心者，即空抖擻取相，即假抖擻塵沙，即中抖擻無明，一心中抖擻五住(云云)。**  
**Contemplating Mind:**
- *Emptiness:* Shakes off grasping marks.
- *Provisionality:* Shakes off Dust and Sand.
- *Middle:* Shakes off Ignorance.
In One Mind, shaking off the Five Abodes (*Wu Zhu*).

**[452] 三迦葉，迦葉如前釋。「優樓頻蠡」，亦優樓毘，亦優為，此翻木瓜[5]林。「那提」，此翻河，亦江。「伽耶」，亦竭夷亦象，此翻城家。在王舍城南七由旬...**  
**The Three Kāśyapas**: "Kāśyapa" is explained as before.
1.  **Uruvilvā** (*You Lou Pin Luo*): Translates as **Papaya Forest** (*Mu Gua Lin*).
2.  **Nadī** (*Na Ti*): Translates as **River**.
3.  **Gayā** (*Jie Ye*): Translates as **City** or Elephant.
Located 7 yojanas south of Rajgir. In the time of Vipaśyin Buddha, they erected a pagoda pillar together; resulting in being brothers [in this life].
Elder brother was teacher to King Bimbisara, with 500 disciples. Two brothers each had 250, practicing the brother's instruction.
The Buddha performed **Ten Variations** (Miracles): Poison Dragon couldn't harm him; Dragon Fire couldn't burn him; Ganges water couldn't drown him... brought Indra's ambrosia, etc.
Though seeing many miracles, [Uruvilva's] wrong attachment did not change. He said: "Though Gautama is miraculous, he is not as true as my Way."
Buddha said: "You are not an Arhat, nor have you attained the Way."
Suddenly he opened to awakening; master and disciples all submitted. Two brothers seeing the signs also returned to the Buddha. Thus **1,000 Bhikshus**.

(Teaching Analysis per *Ekottara Agama* and 5 Flavors omitted for brevity in summary, but translated in full thought).
**Origin/Trace:** Dwelling in Three Virtues. Forest = Prajna. City = Dharma Body. Water = Liberation. This is the **Secret Origin Treasury**. Traces rely on Forest/City/Water to liberate beings.

**[465] 「舍利弗」，具存應言舍利弗羅，此翻身子，又翻舍利為珠，其母於女人中聰明，聰明相在眼珠，珠之所生故是珠子；又翻身，此女好形身，身之所生故言身子。時人以子顯母，為作[9]此號也。**  
**Śāriputra**: Fully **Śāriputra** (*She Li Fu Luo*).
- Translates as **Body Son** (*Shen Zi*).
- Or translates *Śāri* as **Egret/Bead** (*Zhu*). His mother was the most intelligent of women; the mark of intelligence is in the eye-pupil (bead). Born of this 'bead', thus "Bead Son."
- Or translates [Śāri] as **Body**. This woman had a fine physical form. Born of this body, thus named "Body Son."
People of the time used the child to manifest the [fame of the] mother, thus this title.

**父為作名，名優波提舍...雙顯父母故言舍利弗。弗，子也。**  
Father gave him a name: **Upatiṣya** (*You Po Ti She*). Translates as "Discussing Meaning" (*Lun Yi*)... Or *Tiṣya* is a star name. *Upa* means "Minor/Following".
Thus "**Śāriputra**" (*She Li Fu*) displays both father and mother. *Putra* (*Fu*) means Son.
Surname: *Kaudinya*? (*Ju Li Tuo*). Brahmin caste. *Ekottara*: "Foremost in Wisdom resolving doubts."

**昔者，[11]生經云，過去舅甥俱為織師，知王寶藏，因穿土盜之，大獲珍寶...**  
Long ago, the *Jataka Sutra* says: In the past, uncle and nephew were both weavers. Knew the King's treasure; dug earth and stole it. King said: "Don't announce it. The thief will return; wait and catch him."
Nephew made Uncle fall in; Uncle was caught. Nephew feared identification, so he cut off Uncle's head [and took it].
King ordered corpse placed at crossroads to catch the kin. Nephew drove a cart of firewood, overturned it on the corpse (pretending accident) to burn it [giving funeral rights].
King reset the trap with wine. Nephew came disguised, got guards drunk, put bones in wine jar and left.
King worried about his cleverness; set out the Princess ("Daughter") by the water to catch him. Nephew came on a log, disguised... (Detailed clever escape).
Finally King admired his wisdom and gave him the daughter.
**The Nephew was Śāriputra.** The Uncle was Devadatta.


### Protocol Map: Fascicle 1 (Lines 471-500)
1.  **Śāriputra (continued):**
    -   *Prenatal Signs:* Mother defeated her brother Kausthila (*Ju Chi Luo*) in debate during pregnancy. Kausthila knew the child was wise ("entrusting eloquence to mother's mouth"), so he went to study ("Long Nails" Brahmin).
    -   *Early Life:* At age 8, defeated all scholars at the King's assembly. At 16, mastered all 16 Great States' philosophies.
    -   *Teacher:* Sañjaya Vairatiputra (*Sha Ran*). Sariputra mastered his way in 7 days.
    -   *Conversion:* Met Aśvajit (*E Pi*) begging. Heard the verse: "All Dharmas arise from conditions..." (*Ye Dharma Hetu...*). Attained Srotapanna instantly. Converted Moggallana and 250 disciples.
    -   *Position:* "Right-hand disciple" among Sravakas. Converted the 500 heretics led by Devadatta back to the Sangha.
    -   *Meeting Pūrṇa:* Sariputra and Pūrṇa Maitrāyaniputra (*Man Ci Zi*) check each other's attainment in the *Andhavana* (Blind Forest). Purna uses the "Seven Relay Chariots" metaphor (King Pasenadi going to Saketa) to explain purification levels. Sariputra praises him with "lion's roar."
2.  **Maudgalyayana (Mu Lian):**
    -   *Contest of Powers:* Dragon King asks Buddha to summon Sariputra. Moggallana goes to call him.
    -   *Sewing Scene:* Sariputra sewing robe; Moggallana tries to move him with powers (shaking earth, etc.) but fails. (demonstrating Sariputra's Samadhi power > Moggallana's Abhijna).
    -   *Buddha's Verdict:* "Sariputra has mastery over 4 Supernatural Powers; Moggallana also has mastery, but cannot move him due to Buddha's power."
    -   *Moggallana's Feat:* Puts 500 arrogant monks in his bowl and lifts them to Brahma Heaven.
3.  **Wisdom Analysis (Teaching Specific):**
    -   **Tripitaka Wisdom:** "Right-Hand General." Cutting fetters, verifying Truth, assisting Buddha.
    -   **Shared Wisdom:** Breaking "Buddha View, Bodhi View, Dharma Wheel View" (as seen in *Prajñā* Sutras). Not just breaking samsaric views.
    -   **Distinct Wisdom:** Explained via **Five Flavors**:
        -   Milk/Cream Only: First Teaching.
        -   Cream Only (not from Milk): Shared Teaching (Nature Empty).
        -   Milk -> Cream -> Curds -> Butter -> Ghee: **Distinct Teaching** (Gradual Cultivation).
    -   **Perfect Wisdom:** "Eating Poisonous Herb (Nirvishi) produces Ghee." All medicines are included. This is Perfect Wisdom.

**[472] 胎者，父名優波提舍...妻夢見人身被甲冑，手執金剛杵碎一切山...弟弟自念言：「此非姊力，必懷智人寄辯母口...」...時人呼為長爪梵志(云云)。**  
Regarding the Womb: Father Upatisya... Wife dreamed of a man in armor holding a Vajra mace smashing all mountains...
The younger brother (Kausthila) thought: "This is not my sister's power; she must be carrying a wise man who entrusts his eloquence to the mother's mouth."
He left home to study broadly; no time to cut his nails. People called him the "Long-Nail Brahmin" (*Dirghanakha*).

**[474] 難陀、跋難陀二龍，護王舍城，雨澤以時...身子以八歲之年身到會所，問人三座...即越眾，登論床...盡墮諸幢，無敢當者。**  
Nanda and Upananda, the two Dragon Kings, protected Rajgir...
At age **eight**, [Sariputra] went to the King's assembly... asked about the three high seats (King, Prince, Debater). He climbed the Debate Seat. The scholars were ashamed to debate a child... [but he defeated them]. All banners fell; no one dared oppose him.

**及年十六，究盡閻[3]浮典籍...師事沙然梵志...頞䫌答云：「諸法從緣生，是故說因緣，是法緣及盡，我師如是說。」一聞即得須陀洹果...調達破僧，引五百比丘去，身子往化五百人歸(云云)。」**  
At age **sixteen**, mastered all Jambudvipa classics... Served standard Brahmin teachers (*Sañjaya*)...
Met **Aśvajit** (*E Pi* - also *Assaji*) whose deportment was serene. Asked his Master's dharma.
Aśvajit answered: "**All Dharmas arise from Conditions; thus the Cause and Conditions are preached. These Dharmas' conditions also extinguish; my Master teaches thus.**" (*Ye Dharma Hetu...*)
Hearing it once, he attained the **Srotapanna** fruit.
(Later): Devadatta broke the Sangha, leading 500 Bhikshus away. Sariputra went and converted the 500 to return.

**勞度差捔力，度差為花池，身子為象拔花蹋池...《中阿含》云：「身子是四眾所生母，目連是所養母(云云)。」**  
Contest with Raudraksha (*Lao Du Cha*): Raudraksha [magically] made a flower pond; Sariputra made an Elephant to trample it... (etc.).
*Madhyama Agama*: "Sariputra is the **Birth Mother** of the Four Assemblies; Maudgalyayana is the **Nursing Mother**."

**[485] 《中阿含》第二云...「滿慈子...後於安陀林——此云勝林——相見...仁者[13]聽我說喻。如波斯匿王欲從拘薩羅至婆雞帝，中間布七車，捨初乘二...若離此七者，凡夫人當般涅槃...從戒淨至心淨，乃至道迹智斷淨。」**  
*Madhyama Agama*: Pūrṇa Maitrāyaniputra... met in the Andhavana (Blind/Victory Forest).
[Purna uses the] **Seven Relay Chariots Metaphor**: Like King Prasenajit going from Kosala to Saketa (Sravasti to Saketa?), setting up seven relay chariots. Abandoning the first to ride the second...
"Is the first chariot the arrival?" "No." "Is it apart from the chariots?" "No."
From **Precept Purity** to **Mind Purity**... up to **Path-Trace Wisdom-Severance Purity**. (The Seven Stages of Purification).

**[495] 《[A2]中阿含》第二十云：「佛在阿耨達池，龍王云：『此眾不見舍利弗，願佛召之。』佛命目連往祇洹呼，身子正縫五納衣...即以衣繩擲地，『汝能舉此耶？』目連...盡力舉不起。身子于時以繩繫閻浮樹，一天下動；繫二三四，四天下亦不立...十方佛世界皆鎮鎮不動。**  
*Madhyama Agama*: Buddha at Anavatapta Lake. Dragon King asked for Sariputra. Buddha sent **Maudgalyayana** (*Mu Lian*) to call him.
Sariputra was sewing his robe. Said: "You go first." Moggallana tried to force him.
Sariputra threw his sash on the ground: "Can you lift this?" Moggallana tried with all might but couldn't.
Sariputra tied it to the Jambu Tree—the whole world shook. Tied to 4 worlds... up to 10 directions Buddha worlds shook.

**目連自念：『我神力第一，今不能動，將不失神力？』...佛言：『舍利弗於四神力得自在，目連亦自在，而不能拔者，佛力耳。』**  
Moggallana thought: "I am foremost in Supernatural Power (*Abhijna*), why can I not move him?"
Buddha said: "Sariputra has mastery in 4 Supernatural Powers; Moggallana also has mastery. That he cannot pull him is due to the Buddha's [sustaining] power."

**語目連云：『現汝神力。』目連以鉢絡盛五百比丘，舉著梵宮，一足躡須彌，一足至梵宮，身在彼方而說偈滿大千國，五百心伏(云云)。」**  
Buddha told Moggallana: "Show your power." Moggallana put 500 [arrogant] Bhikshus in his bowl, lifted them to the Brahma Palace. One foot on Sumeru, one on Brahma Palace... 500 minds submitted.

**[499] 約教者，若三藏智慧即是無學十智，斷結證真輔佛揚化。《釋論》四十稱為右面大將，即其義也。**  
**Teaching Analysis:**
- **Tripitaka Wisdom:** The Ten Wisdoms of No-Learning (*Asekha*). Cutting bonds, witnessing Truth, assisting Buddha. *prajñāpāramitā-śāstra* calls him the "Right-Hand General."

**通教智慧者，如《般若》中自說所以為摩訶薩，謂我見、眾生見、佛見、菩提見、轉法輪見，破如此等見故，名摩訶薩。...當知身子非但破生死見，亦破佛見、菩提、法輪、涅槃等見，此慧異初教也。**  
- **Shared Wisdom:** As *Prajna Sutra* says: "Why **Mahasattva**? Because he destroys Self View... Buddha View, Bodhi View, Turning Dharma Wheel View."
You should know Sariputra not only breaks Samsaric Views, but also breaks **Buddha View, Bodhi View, Nirvana View**. This wisdom differs from the First Teaching.

**別教智慧者，當約五味分別...若轉入熟蘇，即應委業領教；若轉入醍醐，如此經中得記作佛也。**  
- **Distinct Wisdom:** Distinguished by the **Five Flavors**.
    - If only Milk/Cream (First Teaching).
    - If "Cream not from Milk" (Shared Teaching - nature empty).
    - If Milk -> Cream -> Curds -> Butter -> Ghee: This is **Distinct Teaching Wisdom** (Gradual sequence).

**若從元初但聞牛食忍草即出醍醐，若能服者眾病皆除，一切諸藥悉入其中。為此修行，即是圓教智慧也。**  
- **Perfect Wisdom:** From the very beginning hearing that "Cows eat Poisonous Grass (*Nirvishi*?) and immediately produce Ghee." (Direct production).
If one can take this, all diseases are removed. All medicines are entered within it. Practicing for this is **Perfect Teaching Wisdom**.


### Protocol Map: Fascicle 1 (Lines 501-530)
1.  **Śāriputra (Conclusion):**
    -   **Origin/Trace:**
        -   *Origin:* Mother = Real Characteristic Wisdom Paramita (*Shi Xiang Zhi Du*). Father = Wisdom. "From Realm (Mother) extends Wisdom (Son)."
        -   *Trace:* Manifesting as "Heretic Wisdom" (teaching 16 Kingdoms), then "Tripitaka Wisdom" (Sravaka), then "Shared/Distinct/Perfect" (Vimalakirti defeat, Prajna leading, Lotus evaluation).
    -   **Contemplating Mind:**
        -   One Mind Three Contemplations gathers all wisdoms.
        -   Empty = Cream. Provisional = Curds/Butter. Middle = Ghee.
2.  **Maudgalyayana (Mu Lian):**
    -   *Names:*
        -   **Mahāmaudgalyāyana** (*Da Mu Jian Lian*).
        -   *Maudgal:* Translated as "Praise/Recitation" (*Zan Song*)? Or "Turnip Root" (*Lai Fu Gen*). Or "Mung Bean" (*Hu Dou*). (Ancestors ate these in retreat).
        -   *Kolita* (*Ju Lv Tuo*): Tree name. Parents prayed to the tree spirit for a son.
    -   *Status:* Left-hand disciple. Foremost in Supernatural Powers (*Abhijna*). "Sariputra = Wisdom/Right; Maudgalyayana = Powers/Left."
    -   *Anecdotes:*
        -   **Moving the Mountain:** Heretics tried to move a mountain with mantras; Moggallana held it still with samadhi.
        -   **Subduing Dragons:** Nanda and Upananda (*Nan Tuo, Ba Nan Tuo*) spat black clouds. Moggallana grew huge, entered their bodies (in/out of eyes/ears), and subdued them. Put them in his bowl to show the Buddha.
        -   **Purifying the Assembly:** In *Samyukta Agama*, Buddha refused to recite precepts because the assembly was impure. Moggallana spotted the two impure monks (Horse-Master/Full-Constellation?) and dragged them out.
        -   **Jīvaka in Heaven:** Jivaka (*Qi Yu*) reborn in Trayastrimsa. Too busy playing to greet his former master. Moggallana showed him the impermanence of Indra's "Victory Hall" (*Sudharma*) to wake them up.
        -   **Testing Buddha's Voice:** Moggallana flew East to find the limit of the Buddha's voice. Landed in a world of giants (Buddha "Light King"?). Giants thought he was a "Head Worm" (*Tou Chong*). They put him on the rim of a bowl.

**[506] 本迹者，本住實相智度為母，從境生智慧，境即是身，智慧即是子...欲烹乳為酪...欲引酪為生蘇，訥大現小，受淨名之屈；欲引生蘇為熟蘇...於般若領教；欲引熟蘇為醍醐...**  
**Origin and Trace:**
- **Origin:** Abiding in Real Characteristic Wisdom Paramita (*Prajnaparamita*) as **Mother**. From the Realm/Object arises Wisdom. The Realm is the Body (*Shen*); Wisdom is the Son (*Zi*).
Compassionate for beings, the **Trace** manifests the Five Flavors:
    - Turning affliction-blood into Good Milk (Heretic Wisdom).
    - Cooking Milk into Cream (Tripitaka Wisdom - Second World Honored One).
    - Drawing Cream into Curds: "Retracting the Great to manifest the Small," suffering defeat from Vimalakirti (*Jing Ming*).
    - Drawing Curds into Butter: Receiving instruction in the *Prajna*.
    - Drawing Butter into Ghee: Awakening in the *Lotus*.
These are all external manifestations in the Trace; the internal Secret of the Origin has been real for a long time.

**[510] 觀心者，一心三觀，攝得一切智慧...觀心即中故，攝得醍醐智慧...**  
**Contemplating Mind:**
One Mind Three Contemplations gathers all wisdoms.
- Contemplating Mind as **Empty** gathers Cream Wisdom.
- Contemplating Mind as **Provisional** gathers Curds and Butter Wisdoms (and Worldly Wisdom).
- Contemplating Mind as **Middle** gathers Ghee Wisdom.
This is named "One Wisdom is All Wisdoms; All Wisdoms are One Wisdom."

**[514] [6]「大目揵連」，姓也...《文殊問經》翻萊茯根，真諦云：「勿伽羅，[7]此翻胡豆...」《釋論》云：「...名拘律陀...」**  
**Mahāmaudgalyāyana** (*Da Mu Jian Lian*): This is a surname.
- Translates as "Praise and Recitation" (*Zan Song*).
- *Manjushri Inquires Sutra* translates as **Turnip Root** (*Lai Fu Gen*).
- Paramartha says: *Maudgala* translates as **Mung Bean** (*Hu Dou*). The ancient sages liked to eat these two things, so they named the clan after them.
- *Prajna Sastra*: His father was **Kolita** (*Ju Lv Tuo*), named after the Kolita Tree. Prayed to the tree spirit for a son.
*Ekottara*: "Among my disciples, freely flying to the ten directions, **Mahāmaudgalyāyana is Foremost**."
*Prajna Sastra*: Called the **Left-Hand Disciple**. (Sariputra is Right, Maudgalyayana is Left).
*Anecdote:* 500 Heretics tried to move a mountain with mantras. Moggallana sat in emptiness above the mountain; it would not move.

**[522] 「難陀、跋難陀」，兄弟，居須彌邊海...是龍瞋恨...目連云：「我能降是龍。」...目連化為細身入龍身內，從眼入耳出、耳入鼻出...目連手擎將還...**  
**Nanda and Upananda**, Dragon brothers, lived by Sumeru's sea. Angry that "Bald men" (monks) flew over them. Spat black clouds/fog.
Buddha forbade others, but allowed Moggallana to subdue them.
Dragon coiled Mt Sumeru 7 times. Moggallana grew huge, coiled it 14 times.
Dragon rained Vajra sand. Moggallana turned it to soft flowers.
Moggallana turned into a tiny body, entered the Dragon's body—**in through the eye, out the ear; in the ear, out the nose**—gnawing its body. The Dragon submitted.
Moggallana put the two dragons [in his bowl?] and brought them to the Buddha.

**[524] 《雜阿含》二十九...佛默然不言...目連尋入定，觀誰不清淨，見馬師、滿宿二比丘，即手執牽出...**  
*Samyukta Agama*: Buddha silent during Uposatha. Ananda asked 4 times. Buddha: "The assembly is not pure."
Moggallana entered Samadhi, saw the two impure Bhikshus (**Aśvajit and Punarvasu**? "Horse Master" and "Full Star"). He grabbed them by the hand, threw them out, and locked the door.
Buddha: "I will not recite the precepts myself [anymore]."

**[526] 「耆域」，此翻固活...目連飛往，帝釋將目連看堂...即變化燒得勝堂...**  
**Jīvaka** (*Qi Yu*): Translates as "Solid Life" (*Gu Huo*). Reborn in Trayastrimsa.
Moggallana (his former teacher's associate) visited. Jivaka was driving a chariot, just folded his hands without stopping [too busy playing].
Moggallana stopped the chariot... Moggallana flew to Indra's **Victory Hall** (*Sudharma*?). Moggallana turned the hall into ash/ruin to show impermanence. Indra rejoiced.

**[530] 如來梵聲深遠...目連欲知佛聲遠近，極去遠遠猶如近聞...彼人驚怪：「此人頭蟲從何處來？」**  
The Tathagata's **Brahma Voice** is deep and far-reaching. Heard near or far, it is the same.
Moggallana wanted to know the limit. Flew West (East?) past Ganges sands of lands. Still heard it as if near.
Exhausting his power, he landed on a bowl's rim where giants were eating.
The giants said: "**Where did this Head-Worm (*Tou Chong*) come from?**"
That Buddha said: "This is the disciple of Shakyamuni Buddha in the Saha world... Do not slight him."

**[532] 約教論神通者，依四禪十四變化...能作十八變...依空起慧...次地依三諦習得神通...依於實相所得神通...**  
**Teaching Analysis of Supernatural Powers (*Abhijna*):**

**Mahākātyāyana**:

*Dirgha Agama*: A Heretic held the View of Annihilation (No Afterlife)...
- **Heretic:** "I see people die and not return; thus no afterlife."
- **Katyayana:** "If a criminal is imprisoned, can he return home?"
- **Heretic:** "If they are born in Heaven, why not return?"
- **Katyayana:** "If a man falls in a toilet and gets out, would he go back in? Also, one day in heaven is 100 years here. They haven't even settled in yet; and by the time they return, you are dead."
- **Heretic:** "I boiled a criminal in a sealed pot/caldron; watched but saw no soul exit."
- **Katyayana:** "When you sleep, do people see your soul leave?"
- **Heretic:** "I weighed a dying man. If soul leaves, should be lighter. If no soul, then no afterlife."
- **Katyayana:** "Hot iron is light; cold iron is heavy. A living body with spirit is light/supple; a dead body without spirit is heavy/stiff."
- **Heretic:** "I cannot abandon this view."
- **Katyayana:** "Like a man gathering hemp. First takes hemp. Then sees hemp-bark -> thread -> cloth -> silk -> silver -> gold. If you see Gold (Truth), why not abandon Hemp (Lower View)?"

**Cūḍapanthaka** (*Zhou Li Pan Te* - Slower Brother) performed 18 transformations. Brahmin: "He only flies; he doesn't understand meaning."
Katyayana heard with Divine Ear. Hid Panthaka, manifested his own body as Panthaka. Descended and asked: "What is your name?"
Brahmin: "Name is **Male/Huge Husband** (*Nan Zhang Fu*)."
Katyayana: "Male is Husband, Husband is Male. Is this not redundant?"
... Defeated him on the "Five Aggregates arising from Craving" and "Eightfold Path ceases Craving."

**[561] 姓者，劫初大水風吹結構以成世界...眾共生中呼為眾生...遂立一平能者，為田主...是為民主。**

**從懿摩王四子...被猜徙雪山北直樹林中...父王歎曰：「我子有能。」...又其地釋迦樹甚茂，此翻直林...**  
King Okkaka's four sons were exiled to the Himalayas, into the **Direct Tree Forest** (*Śāka Forest*). Father praised them: "My sons are **Capable** (*Śākya*)."
Also the *Śāka* trees were lush; translates as "Direct Forest." Thus named **Śākya**.

Dronodana (*Hu Fan*) had two sons: Eldest **Mahānāma**, Youngest **Aniruddha**.
Thus Aniruddha is Suddhodana's nephew, the World Honored One's cousin, Ananda's cousin, Rahula's uncle.
