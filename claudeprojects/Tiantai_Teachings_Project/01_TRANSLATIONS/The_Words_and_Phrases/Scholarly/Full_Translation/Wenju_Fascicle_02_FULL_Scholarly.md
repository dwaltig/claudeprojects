## 6. THE LIST OF ARHATS (Continued)

### 11. Gavāmpati (憍梵波提)

**「憍梵波提」，此翻牛呞，《無量壽》稱牛王，《增一》云：「牛跡，昔五百世曾為牛王，牛若食後，恒事虛哨；餘報未夷，唼唼常嚼，時人稱為牛呞。」**

**"Gavāmpati" (憍梵波提 *Jiāofànbōtí*):[^1] Translated as "Cow Ruminate" (*Niú Shī*). The *Immeasurable Life Sutra* calls him "Ox King." The *Ekottara Āgama* says: "[Regarding] trace-actions like an ox: in the past for five hundred lifetimes he was an ox king. When an ox finishes eating, it constantly engages in empty chewing (ruminating). Because his residual retribution was not yet extinguished, he made a *shà-shà* sound, constantly chewing. Contemporaries called him 'Cow Ruminate'."**

[^1]: **Gavāmpati:** Represents the purification of oral karma. Even an Arhat retains the "trace" (*vāsanā*) of past habits, though the defilement is gone.

---

**昔五百雁，一雁常得花果，供於雁王，佛一夏受阿耆達王請，五百比丘皆噉馬麥，而憍梵獨在天上尸利沙園，受天王供養。**

**In the past, among five hundred wild geese, one goose always obtained flowers and fruits to offer to the Goose King. [Later,] when the Buddha accepted the invitation of King Agnidatta regarding the summer retreat, five hundred bhikṣus all ate horse-fodder, yet Gavāmpati alone was in the Śirīṣa Garden[^2] in the heavens, receiving offerings from the Heavenly King.**

[^2]: **Śirīṣa Garden:** The garden of the Acacia trees in the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven.

---

**《增一》云：「樂在天上，不樂人間者，牛跡比丘第一。」**

**The *Ekottara Āgama* says: "Among those who delight in being in the heavens and do not delight in the human world, the Bhikṣu 'Ox-Traces' [Gavāmpati] is foremost."**

---

**樂在天上者，是隨樂欲，世界悉檀也；供雁王福所致者，為人也；避人笑者，對治也；天不笑者，第一義也(云云)。**

**"Delighting in being in the heavens" corresponds to following desires and preferences—this is the *Worldly Siddhānta*. "Caused by the merit of offering to the Goose King" corresponds to the *Individual Siddhānta*. "Avoiding the ridicule of humans" corresponds to the *Therapeutic Siddhānta*. "The gods do not ridicule" corresponds to the *Ultimate Siddhānta*.[^3]**

[^3]: **Four Siddhāntas Application:** Zhiyi applies his hermeneutical key to every disciple. Gavāmpati's residence in heaven is not just a quirk; it fulfills all four teaching modes.

---

**又云：「人但觀形不知有德，若笑羅漢即得罪，避人笑故常居天上，天知有德不笑其形，故居天也。」**

**Furthermore, it is said: "Humans only observe the form and do not know he possesses virtue. If they were to ridicule an Arhat, they would incur sin. Therefore, to avoid human ridicule, he constantly dwells in the heavens. The gods know he possesses virtue and do not ridicule his form; thus he dwells in the heavens."**

---

**佛滅度後，迦葉集千大羅漢，遣下座僧使追憍梵，憍梵問：「佛及和尚。」答言：「皆滅。」即言：「佛出我出，佛住我住，佛滅我滅。」**

**After the Buddha's Parinirvāṇa, [Mahā-]Kāśyapa gathered a thousand great Arhats and dispatched a junior monk to summon Gavāmpati. Gavāmpati asked: "What of the Buddha and my Preceptor (*upādhyāya*)?" The reply was: "They have both entered extinction." He immediately said: "When the Buddha appears, I appear; when the Buddha abides, I abide; when the Buddha enters extinction, I enter extinction."**

---

**四道流注大迦葉所，水說偈(云云)：「大象既去象子隨，世尊和尚既滅度，我今在此復何為？」斯亦第一義也。**

**Four streams [from his body] flowed to the place of Mahākāśyapa, and the water spoke a verse: "Since the great elephant has departed, the young elephant follows. Since the World Honored One and the Preceptor have entered extinction, why should I remain here now?" This is also the *Ultimate Siddhānta*.**

---

**約教者，住天園是示善，有牛嚼是示惡，三藏意也。以牛嚼身得道，此示惡非惡也，居天園而嚼，示善非善，通教意。示界內外善惡者，別教意。示善惡實相者，圓教意。**

**According to the *Teachings* (*yuējiào* 約教):**
*   **Tripiṭaka:** Dwelling in the heavenly garden demonstrates good; having cow-chewing [habits] demonstrates evil.
*   **Shared (Tong):** Attaining the Way with a cow-chewing body demonstrates that evil is not [inherently] evil; chewing while dwelling in a heavenly garden demonstrates that good is not [inherently] good.
*   **Distinct (Bie):** Demonstrating the good and evil of both the mundane (within the realms) and supramundane (outside the realms).
*   **Perfect (Yuan):** Demonstrating the **Reality Mark** (*shíxiàng*) of good and evil.

---

**本迹者，本住四無所畏，安住聖主如牛王第一義天；迹示牛呞樂居天上也。**

**According to the *Fundamental and Trace* (*běnjì* 本迹):**
*   **Fundamental:** He abides in the Four Fearlessnesses, peacefully abiding as a Noble Lord like the Ox King in the Heaven of Ultimate Truth.
*   **Trace:** He manifests cow-ruminating and delights in dwelling in the [literal] heavens.

---

**觀心者，觀於心性中道之理，安步平正其疾如風，即牛王觀也。**

**According to *Contemplating the Mind* (*guānxīn* 觀心):**
*   Contemplating the principle of the Middle Way of the mind-nature; walking peacefully and uprightly yet with speed like the wind—this is the **Ox King Contemplation**.

---

### 12. Revata (離婆多)

**「離婆多」，亦云離越，此翻星宿，或室宿，或假和合，《文殊問經》稱常作聲。**

**"Revata" (離婆多 *Lípódūo*): Also called Li-yue. Translated as "Constellation" (*Xīngxiù*),[^4] or "House Constellation" (*Shìxiù*), or "False Union" (*Jiǎhéhé*). The *Mañjuśrī Inquiry Sutra* calls him "Constantly Making Sound."**

[^4]: **Constellation:** From Sanskrit *Revatī* (a nakṣatra).

---

**父母從星辰乞子，既其感獲因星作名，雖得出家猶隨本字。**

**His parents begged for a child from the stars (*xīngchén*). Since they obtained him through this response, they named him after the star. Although he left home [to become a monk], he still followed his original name.**

---

**假和合者，有人引《釋論》，空亭中宿，見二鬼爭屍，告其分判。設依理、枉理俱不免害，故隨實而答。大鬼拔其手足，小鬼取屍補之，食竟，拭口而去。其因煩惱不測誰身故，言假和合。**

**As for "False Union": Someone cites the *Dazhilun* (Māhaprajñāpāramitā-śāstra): spending the night in an empty pavilion, he saw two ghosts fighting over a corpse and they asked him to judge [whose it was]. Whether he relied on reason or twisted reason, he could not avoid harm, so he answered according to the facts. The big ghost ripped off his hands and feet; the small ghost took [limbs from] the corpse to patch him up. When they finished eating [his original limbs], they wiped their mouths and left. Because of his distress at not fathom whose body this was, it is called "False Union."**

---

**常作聲者，其疑此事，若我本身眼見拔去，若是他身復隨我行住。疑惑猶豫逢人即問：「汝見我身不？」故言常作聲。**

**As for "Constantly Making Sound": He doubted this matter—"If it was my original body, I saw it ripped away generally. If it is another's body, it now follows me in walking and dwelling." Doubting and hesitating, whenever he met someone he would ask: "Do you see my body or not?" Thus it is said he "Constantly Making Sound."**

---

**眾僧云：「此人易度。」語云：「汝身本是他遺體，非己有也。」即得道也(云云)。《增一》云：「坐禪入定，心不倒亂者，離越比丘第一。」**

**The multitude of monks said: "This person is easily liberated." They told him: "Your body was originally the remnants of another; it is not your own possession." He immediately attained the Way. The *Ekottara Āgama* says: "Among those who sit in meditation (*dhyāna*) entering samādhi with a mind not inverted or scattered, the Bhikṣu Revata is foremost."**

---

**約教言，析破五陰非我所有，三藏意。體達五陰本非我有，通意。分別十法界、五陰皆非己有，別意。達五陰非我有、非他有，見陰實相，即圓意。**

**According to the *Teachings*:**
*   **Tripiṭaka:** Analytically destroying the Five Aggregates as not "my" possession.
*   **Shared:** Embodying the understanding that the Five Aggregates are originally not "mine."
*   **Distinct:** Discriminating that the Five Aggregates of the Ten Dharma Realms are all not "one's own possession."
*   **Perfect:** Understanding the Five Aggregates are not "mine" nor "another's"—seeing the **Reality Mark of the Aggregates**.

---

**本迹者，本住日星宿三昧，迹示此名。**

**According to *Fundamental and Trace*:**
*   **Fundamental:** Abiding in the Sun, Star, and Constellation Samādhi.
*   **Trace:** Manifesting this name.

---

**觀心者，觀心念佛，見十方佛多，如夜觀星(云云)。**

**According to *Contemplating the Mind*:**
*   Contemplating the mind mindful of the Buddha (*niànfó*), seeing the Buddhas of the ten directions as numerous as observing stars at night.

---

### 13. Pilindavatsa (畢陵伽婆蹉)

**「畢陵伽婆蹉」，此翻餘習，五百世為婆羅門，餘氣猶高，過恒水：「咄！小婢駐流。」**

**"Pilindavatsa" (畢陵伽婆蹉 *Bìlíngqiápócuō*): Translated as "Residual Habit" (*Yúxí*). For five hundred lifetimes he was a Brahmin, and his residual arrogance (*yúqì*) was still high. Crossing the Ganges River, he said: "Hey! Little Maid, stop the flow!"**

---

**恒神為之兩派。神往訴佛，佛令懺謝，即合手：「小婢莫瞋。」大眾笑之，懺而更罵。佛言：「本習如此，實無高心。」《增一》云：「樹下苦坐，不避風雨者，婆蹉比丘第一。」**

**The River Goddess parted the stream for him. The spirit went to complain to the Buddha. The Buddha ordered him to apologize. He immediately joined his palms: "Little Maid, do not be angry." The great assembly laughed at him—apologizing yet scolding again! The Buddha said: "His original habit is like this; effectively he has no arrogant mind." The *Ekottara Āgama* says: "Among those who sit in bitter practice under trees, avoiding neither wind nor rain, the Bhikṣu Vatsa is foremost."**

---

**約教者，滅慢無慢，三藏意也。即慢無慢，通意也。分別十法界高下，別意也。八自在我具足佛法，圓意也。**

**According to the *Teachings*:**
*   **Tripiṭaka:** Extinguishing pride, [realizing] no pride.
*   **Shared:** [Realizing] pride itself is no-pride (*jí màn wú màn*).
*   **Distinct:** Discriminating the highs and lows of the Ten Dharma Realms.
*   **Perfect:** The Eight Self-Existences (*zìzài*); "I" am complete with the Buddha-Dharma.

---

**本迹者，本住常樂我淨八自在我，微妙梵聲；迹示慢心惡口耳。**

**According to *Fundamental and Trace*:**
*   **Fundamental:** Abiding in the Eternity, Bliss, Self, and Purity (Four Virtues) and the Eight Self-Existences; the subtle Brahma voice.
*   **Trace:** Manifesting an arrogant mind and rough speech.

---

**觀心者，觀麁言、軟語皆歸第一義(云云)。**

**According to *Contemplating the Mind*:**
*   Contemplating that coarse speech and soft words both return to the Ultimate Truth (*Dìyīyì*).

---

### 14. Vakkula (薄拘羅)

**「薄拘羅」者，此翻善容，或偉形，或大肥盛，或腬囊，或楞鄧，或賣性，然而色貌端正，故言善容也。**

**"Vakkula" (薄拘羅 *Bójūluó*): Translated as "Good Countenance" (*Shànróng*), or "Great Form," or "Great Fatness/Prosperity," or "Soft Bag," or "Leng-deng," or "Selling Nature." However, because his physical appearance was upright and correct, it is called "Good Countenance."**

---

**年一百六十歲，無病無夭，有五不死報。後母置熬盤釜中、水中，魚食、刀破皆不死，昔持不殺戒故，九十一劫命不中夭。**

**He was one hundred and sixty years old, without sickness or premature death, possessing the retribution of "Five Undying States." His stepmother placed him in a roasting pan/cauldron, in water, [he was] eaten by a fish, [the fish was] cut by a knife—in all cases he did not die. Because in the past he upheld the precept against killing, for ninety-one kalpas his life was not cut short.**

---

**昔施僧一訶梨勒果故，身常無病，能持一戒、四戒莊嚴，堅持不犯不避火水，餘人雖持五戒，多毀犯也(云云)。**

**Because in the past he gave one Haritaki fruit to the Saṃgha, his body was constantly without sickness. He was able to hold "One Precept" [against killing] and adorned with "Four Precepts"; holding them firmly without transgression, he did not [need to] avoid fire or water. Other people, though they hold the five precepts, mostly violate them.**

---

**身樂寂靜，常處閑居，不樂眾中，眼不樂玄黃等色，耳不樂聞世間之聲，鼻不嗅世間香臭，舌不曾為人說一兩句語，意常在禪定不散亂，乃至舍利塔亦樂閑靜。**

**His body delighted in stillness; he constantly dwelt in leisure, not delighting in crowds. His eyes did not delight in colors like black and yellow; his ears did not delight in hearing worldly sounds... his tongue never spoke even one or two sentences for others; his mind was constantly in *dhyāna* without scattering. Even [after death] his śarīra stupa delighted in leisure and stillness.**

---

**阿育王禮諸羅漢塔，次至其塔而說偈言：「雖自練無明，於世少利益。」供二十貝子。《增一》云：「施一錢而貝子從塔飛出，來著王足。諸臣驚怪，閑靜少欲乃至其塔猶有是力故。」《增一》云：「壽命極長終不中夭，常樂閑居，不處眾中，薄拘羅第一。」**

**King Aśoka paid homage to the stupas of the Arhats. When he came next to [Vakkula's] stupa, he spoke a verse: "Although he trained himself in [removing] ignorance, he was of little benefit to the world." He offered twenty cowrie shells. The *Ekottara Āgama* says: "He offered one coin [cowrie], and the cowrie flew out from the stupa and attached itself to the King's foot. The ministers were astonished—even his stupa had such power of leisure, stillness, and few desires." The *Ekottara* says: "Among those of extremely long life never cut short, constantly delighting in leisure dwelling and not abiding in crowds, Vakkula is foremost."**

---

**約教者，滅喧入真，三藏寂靜。即喧而真，通寂靜。離二邊入中，別寂靜。即邊而中，圓寂靜。**

**According to the *Teachings*:**
*   **Tripiṭaka:** Extinguishing noise to enter the Real (*zhēn*)—Tripiṭaka Stillness.
*   **Shared:** [Realizing that] noise *is* the Real—Shared Stillness.
*   **Distinct:** Leaving the two extremes to enter the Middle—Distinct Stillness.
*   **Perfect:** The extremes *are* the Middle (*jí biān ér zhōng*)—Perfect Stillness.

---

**本者，本住大寂滅定，長壽是常，無病是樂，不夭是我，寂靜是淨；居此四德之本，迹示六根寂靜耳。**

**According to *Fundamental*: He abides in the Great Quiescent Samādhi (Mahāparinirvāṇa). Long life is **Permanence**; no sickness is **Bliss**; no premature death is **Self**; stillness is **Purity**. Dwelling in the root of these Four Virtues, his trace demonstrates the stillness of the six sense faculties.**

---

**觀心者，心性中道，即空、即假、即中，常、樂、我、淨觀也。**

**According to *Contemplating the Mind*: The Middle Way of Mind-Nature (*xīnxìng*)—identical to Emptiness, Provisionality, and the Middle—is the contemplation of Permanence, Bliss, Self, and Purity.**

---

### 15. Mahākauṣṭhila (摩訶拘絺羅)

**「摩訶拘絺羅」，此翻大膝，舍利弗舅，由來論勝姊。姊孕，論則不勝，知所懷者，智寄辯尚爾，何況出胎？(云云)即棄家往南天竺，讀十八經。**

**"Mahākauṣṭhila" (摩訶拘絺羅 *Móhē Jūchīluó*): Translated as "Big Knee" (*Dàxī*). He was Śāriputra's uncle. Formerly he won arguments against his sister. When his sister was pregnant, he could not win arguments [against her]. He knew that the one she carried [Śāriputra] was wise—if the eloquence borrowed [by the unborn child] was like this, how much more so after birth? He immediately abandoned his home and went to South India to read the eighteen classics.**

---

**時人笑之：「累世難通，一生非冀。」喟然歎曰：「在家為姊所勝，出路為他所輕。」誓讀不休，無暇剪爪，時人呼為長爪梵志。**

**Contemporaries ridiculed him: "[These texts] are difficult to master over consecutive lifetimes; one lifetime is not enough to hope for it." He gathered his breath and sighed: "At home I was defeated by my sister; on the road I am slighted by others." He vowed to read without resting, having no time to cut his nails. Contemporaries called him the "Long-Nail Brahmin" (*Dīrghanakha*).**

---

**學訖還家，問甥所在，人云：「為佛弟子。」即大憍慢：「我甥八歲聲震五竺，彼沙門者有何道術誘我姊子？」徑往佛所，思惟良久，不得一法入心，語佛言：「一切法不忍，忍即安義，此言一切法我皆能破，使不得安故，言一切法不忍。」**

**Finishing his studies, he returned home and asked where his nephew was. People said: "He is a disciple of the Buddha." He became greatly arrogant: "My nephew at age eight shook the Five Indias with his voice. What method does that Śramaṇa [Buddha] have to seduce my sister's son?" He went directly to the Buddha. He thought for a long time but could not get a single dharma into his mind. He told the Buddha: "I do not endure (*ren*, accept/sanction) all dharmas." (*Ren* implies 'peace/stability'; this means "I can destroy all dharmas so they cannot find stability," thus "I do not accept all dharmas.")**

---

**佛問：「汝見是忍不？」此墮兩負處：若我見忍，前已云：「一切不忍。」若我見不忍，無以勝佛，即低頭，得法眼淨。身子扇佛聞舅論，得阿羅漢果。《增一》云：「得四辯才，觸難能答，拘絺羅第一。」南方天王毘留匐叉常來隨侍。**

**The Buddha asked: "Do you 'accept' this view [of not accepting]?" He fell into a double defeat: If "I accept [my view]," then previously I said "I do not accept *all* [dharmas]." If "I do not accept [my view]," then I have no way to defeat the Buddha. He immediately lowered his head and attained the Purity of the Dharma Eye. Śāriputra, who was fanning the Buddha and heard his uncle's argument, attained the Fruit of Arhatship. The *Ekottara Āgama* says: "Among those who attain the Four Eloquences and can answer difficult questions upon contact, Kauṣṭhila is foremost." ...**

---

**約教者，外通四韋陀，內通三藏，三藏四辯也。我無所得，辯乃如是，通教辯也。若名、若義遍十法界，別教辯也。依於實相遍一切辯，圓教辯也。**

**According to the *Teachings*:**
*   **Tripiṭaka:** Externally mastering the Four Vedas, internally mastering the Tripiṭaka—the Four Eloquences of the Tripiṭaka.
*   **Shared:** "I attain nothing," yet eloquence is like this.
*   **Distinct:** If names and meanings pervade the Ten Dharma Realms.
*   **Perfect:** Relying on **Reality Mark**, pervading all eloquence.

---

**本者，本住口密、口輪不思議化，大定、大慧；迹示大膝也。**

**According to *Fundamental*: He abides in the Secret of the Mouth, the inconceivable transformation of the Voice Wheel, Great Concentration and Great Wisdom. His trace manifests as "Big Knee."**

---

**According to *Contemplating the Mind*: Contemplating the mind as identical to Emptiness and Samādhi, identical to Provisionality and Wisdom, thereby adorning the mind.**

---

### 16. Nanda (難陀)

**「難陀」，亦云放牛難陀，此翻善歡喜，亦翻欣樂。淨飯王逼十萬釋出家，即一人也。有師言：「是律中跋難陀。」**

**"Nanda" (難陀 *Nántuó*): Also called "Cowherding Nanda." Translated as "Good Joy" (*Shàn Huānxǐ*) or "Delight" (*Xīnlè*). King Śuddhodana forced ten thousand Śākyas to leave home [to become monks]; he was one of them. Some masters say: "This is the Upananda (*Bá-nántuó*) mentioned in the Vinaya."**

---

**約教者，事歡喜，理無歡喜，三藏意也。即事歡喜是理歡喜，是通教意也。歡喜地，即別教也。歡喜住，即圓教意也。**

**According to the *Teachings*:**
*   **Tripiṭaka:** Phenomenal joy (*shì huānxǐ*), but in principle (*lǐ*) there is no joy.
*   **Shared:** Phenomenal joy *is* principle joy.
*   **Distinct:** The Stage of Joy (*Pramuditā-bhūmi*).
*   **Perfect:** The Abode of Joy (*Huānxǐ-zhù*).

---

**本者，本住實際，非喜非不喜；迹名歡喜。**

**According to *Fundamental*: He abides in the **Reality Limit** (*shíjì*), neither joy nor non-joy; his trace is named "Joy."**

---

**觀心者，觀心與理相似相應，故名歡喜觀也。**

**According to *Contemplating the Mind*: Contemplating the mind as corresponding to Principle in resemblance (*xiāngsì*), thus it given the name "Joy Contemplation."**

---

### 17. Sundarananda (孫陀羅難陀)

**「孫陀羅難陀」，孫陀羅，此翻好愛，亦端正，難陀如前，種姓如那律中說。**

**"Sundarananda" (孫陀羅難陀 *Sūntuóluó Nántuó*): "Sundara" is translated as "Beautiful Love" (*Hǎo'ài*) or "Upright/Correct." "Nanda" is as before. His lineage is as described in the account of Aniruddha.**

---

**四月九日生，短佛四指，容儀挺特與世殊異，若入眾中有不識者，謂言佛來。**

**He was born on the ninth day of the fourth month. He was four fingers shorter than the Buddha. His appearance was outstanding and different from the world; if he entered an assembly and there were those who did not recognize him, they would say "The Buddha has come."**

---

**《彌沙塞律》云：「摩竭有裸形外道，大聰明，國人號為智者、見者，共身子論議，結舌，善心生，欲於佛法出家。見難陀色貌姝偉，歎云：『短小比丘智慧難概，況堂堂者乎？』難陀即度出家。」**

**The *Mahīśāsaka Vinaya* says: "In Magadha there was a naked ascetic (*Nirgrantha*), greatly intelligent; people called him 'The Wise One, The Seer.' He debated with Śāriputra, became tongue-tied, and a good mind arose; he wished to leave home in the Buddha's Dharma. Seeing Nanda's magnificent appearance, he sighed: 'If the wisdom of a short, small bhikṣu [like Śāriputra] is hard to measure, how much more so this imposing one?' Nanda immediately ordained him."**

---

**婦即孫陀利，極端正，食息不相離。佛與阿難途行乞食到其門，正共婦在高樓食，即起迎佛，婦言：『須君還乃共食耳。』白佛言：『轉輪王種云何自辱？』持佛鉢取飯。**

**His wife was Sundarī (*Sūntuólì*), extremely upright and beautiful; in eating and resting they never separated. The Buddha and Ānanda were begging for food and arrived at his gate. He was just eating with his wife in a high tower. He immediately rose to welcome the Buddha. His wife said: 'I must wait for my lord to return before we eat together.' He said to the Buddha: 'How can a Wheel-Turning King's seed disgrace himself [by begging]?' He took the Buddha's bowl to get rice.**

---

**佛即還尼俱類園，語阿難：『令難陀送食來。』阿難宣佛旨，令其送飯奉佛，佛令剃頭，握拳語剃者：『勿持刀臨閻浮提王頂。』佛逼不得止，乃剃頭。**

**The Buddha immediately returned to the Nyagrodha Garden and told Ānanda: 'Let Nanda bring the food.' Ānanda announced the Buddha's decree... The Buddha ordered his head to be shaved. [Nanda] clenched his fist and told the barber: 'Do not bring a knife near the crown of a Jambudvīpa King!' The Buddha coerced him and he could not stop it; thus his head was shaved.**

[Note: The text continues with the story of Nanda trying to escape the monastery to return to his wife, seeing the monkeys in the burning hell, and seeing the nymphs in heaven. Zhiyi summarizes this familiar narrative.]

---

**約教者，俗諦有法喜，真諦無喜，三藏教也。即俗喜是真喜，通教也。從通法喜，有俗法喜、中法喜，別教也。即通喜具一切法喜，圓教也。**

**According to the *Teachings*:**
*   **Tripiṭaka:** Conventional Truth has Dharma Joy (*fǎxǐ*); Ultimate Truth has no joy.
*   **Shared:** Conventional joy *is* true joy.
*   **Distinct:** From Shared Dharma Joy, there is Conventional Dharma Joy and Middle Dharma Joy.
*   **Perfect:** Shared Joy possesses *all* Dharma Joy.

### 18. Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra (富樓那)

**「富樓那」，翻滿願；彌多羅，翻慈；尼，女也。父於滿江禱梵天求子，正值江滿，又夢七寶器，盛滿中寶入母懷，母懷子，父願獲滿，從諸遂願，故言滿願。**

**"Pūrṇa" (富樓那 *Fùlóunà*) translates as "Full Wish" (*Mǎnyuàn*). "Maitrāyaṇī" translates as "Compassion" (*Cí*); "nī" means woman. His father prayed to Brahmā for a son by the Full River (Gangā?); it just happened the river was full. He also dreamt of a seven-jeweled vessel filled with treasures entering the mother's womb. Because the father's wish was fulfilled, he is called "Full Wish."**

---

**母名彌多羅尼，此翻慈行，亦云知識。四韋陀有此品，其母誦之，以此為名。尼者女也，通稱女為尼，通稱男為那，既是慈之所生故言慈子。《增一》云：「我父名滿，我母名慈，諸梵行人呼我為滿慈子。」**

**His mother was named Maitrāyaṇī (*Míduōluóní*), translated as "Compassionate Practice" (*Cíxíng*) or "Knowledge" (*Zhīshì*). The Four Vedas contain this chapter, and his mother recited it, taking it as her name... Since he was born of Compassion, he is called "Son of Compassion" (*Cízǐ*). The *Ekottara Āgama* says: "My father was named Man (Full), my mother was named Ci (Compassion); the pure practitioners call me Full Compassion Son (Mancizi)."**

**《增一》云：「善能廣說分別義理，滿願子最第一。」下文云：「於說法人中最為第一。」第一者，說滿字也。**

**The *Ekottara* says: "In skillfully expounding and analyzing principles, the Son of Full Wish is foremost." The text below [in the *Lotus Sutra*] says: "Among those who preach the Dharma, he is foremost." "Foremost" means he preaches the Full Word (*mǎnzì* - Mahāyāna), not just the Half Word.**

---

**欲還本國利益，佛言：「彼國弊惡，汝云何？」答：「我當修忍，若毀辱我，我當自幸不得拳歐，拳歐時自幸不得木杖，木杖時自幸不得刀刃，刀刃時自幸離五陰毒器。」是為行忍滿，故名滿。**

**He wished to return to his native land to benefit others. The Buddha said: "That country is vile and evil; what will you do?" He replied: "I will cultivate patience (*kṣānti*). If they insult me, I will consider myself lucky they do not hit me with fists. If they hit me with fists, I will consider myself lucky they do not use wooden staffs... lucky they do not use knives... lucky to be separated from this poisonous vessel of the Five Aggregates." This is the fulfillment (*mǎn*) of the practice of patience; thus he is called "Full."**

---

**約教者，殷勤析法，所作已辦，三藏願滿；體達即空，於空法得證，通教願滿；法眼具足，別教願滿；住祕密藏，圓教願滿。**

**According to the *Teachings*:**
*   **Tripiṭaka:** Diligently analyzing dharmas; what was to be done is done—Tripiṭaka Wish Fulfillment.
*   **Shared:** Embodying emptiness; attaining realization in empty dharmas—Shared Wish Fulfillment.
*   **Distinct:** The Dharma Eye is complete—Distinct Wish Fulfillment.
*   **Perfect:** Abiding in the Secret Store (*mìmì zàng*)—Perfect Wish Fulfillment.

---

**本迹者，本願久滿，迹為說法第一，示眾生知識也。**

**According to *Fundamental/Trace*: His fundamental wish was fulfilled long ago; his trace is "Foremost in Preaching Dharma," demonstrating a Good Friend (*kalyāṇamitra*) to sentient beings.**

---

### 19. Subhūti (須菩提)

**「須菩提」，此翻空生，生時家中倉庫筐篋器皿一切皆空。問占者，占者言吉。因空而生，字曰空生。從依報器皿瑞空以名正報，依正俱吉，故言空生也。**

**"Subhūti" (須菩提 *Xūpútí*): Translated as "Empty Born" (*Kōngshēng*). When he was born, the storehouses, baskets, and vessels in his home were all empty. They asked a diviner; the diviner said it was auspicious (*jí*). Because he was born due to emptiness, he was named "Empty Born." Naming the Direct Retribution (person) from the auspicious emptiness of the Dependent Retribution (vessels)—both Dependent and Direct were auspicious, so he is called "Good Auspiciousness" (*Shànjí* - *Subhūti* also means Good/Well-Being).**

---

**常樂遊止閑林石窟寂靜之處，所修行業以空為本，常入空定住無諍三昧，喜說空法，有所宣辯皆分別空。將護眾生不令起礙，嫌行即住，嫌住即行。**

**He constantly delighted in roaming and stopping in leisure forests and stone caves, quiet places. His practice took Emptiness as the root. He constantly entered the Emptiness Samādhi and abode in the **Samādhi of No-Dispute** (*Araṇa*). He delighted in preaching the Dharma of Emptiness... To protect sentient beings from arising obstructions: if they disliked him walking, he stood; if they disliked him standing, he walked.**

---

**佛忉利下，率土輻湊爭前頂禮，端坐石室念諸法空，色非佛乃至識非佛，眼非佛乃至意非佛，豁然悟道。佛告蓮華比丘尼：「非汝前禮，汝禮色身；須菩提前見法身。」**

**When the Buddha descended from the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven, the whole land gathered, vying to be first to bow. [Subhūti] sat upright in his stone chamber recalling the Emptiness of all dharmas: "Form is not the Buddha... Consciousness is not the Buddha... The Eye is not the Buddha..." He suddenly realized the Way. The Buddha told the Nun Utpalavarṇā (Lotus Color): "You are not the first to bow; you bowed to the Form Body. Subhūti saw the Dharma Body first."**

---

**約教者，自有滅色空智生，體色空智生，從有智生空智，從空智生俗智，從俗智生中智，空生即有智，是圓空智生，而今是圓空智生也。**

**According to the *Teachings*: [There is] "Emptiness Wisdom born from extinguishing Form" (Tripiṭaka); "Emptiness Wisdom born from embodying Form" (Shared)... "Emptiness born is Being Wisdom" (*Kōngshēng jí yǒuzhì*), this is Perfect Emptiness Wisdom Born.**

---

**本者，本住實相法身，迹示見空而生也。**

**According to *Fundamental*: He abides in the Reality Mark Dharma Body; his trace demonstrates "Being Born from Seeing Emptiness."**

---

### 20. Ānanda (阿難)

**「阿難」，此云歡喜，或無染，淨飯王冀太子為金輪霸其宗社，忽棄國捐王，憂惱殆絕，魔來誑之：「汝子已死。」王哭云：「阿夷語既虛，瑞相亦無驗。」**

**"Ānanda" (阿難 *Ānán*): Translated as "Joy" (*Huānxǐ*) or "No Defilement" (*Wúrǎn*). King Śuddhodana hoped the Crown Prince [Siddhārtha] would become a Gold Wheel [King] to dominate the clan and society. Suddenly he abandoned the country... The King's grief was nearly fatal. Mara came to deceive him: "Your son is dead."**

---

**復有天來云：「汝子成佛。」王疑未決，須臾信報：「昨夜天地大動，太子成佛。」王大歡喜，白飯王奏云：「生兒。」舉國欣欣，因名歡喜，是為父母作字。**

**Then a Deva came and said: "Your son has become a Buddha." ... In a moment a messenger reported: "Last night heaven and earth shook greatly; the Prince has become a Buddha." The King had Great Joy. [At that moment] King Śuklodana reported: "[I] have born a son." The whole country was jubilant. Because of this he was named "Joy." This is the name given by his parents.**

---

**阿難端正，人見皆悅，佛使著覆肩衣。有一女人將兒詣井，見阿難目視不眴，不覺以綆繫其兒頸。**

**Ānanda was upright and correct; all who saw him were pleased. The Buddha made him wear a robe covering his shoulder [to hide his beauty]. A woman taking her child to the well saw Ānanda and stared unblinkingly; unknowingly she tied the rope around her child's neck [instead of the bucket].**

---

**《中阿含》云：「四眾若聞阿難所說，若多若少無不歡喜，欲發問時先為謦咳，大眾皆歡喜。四眾若觀其默，行住坐臥，指撝處分，進止動轉皆歡喜。」**

**The *Madhyama Āgama* says: "If the four assemblies hear what Ānanda says, whether much or little, there are none who do not rejoice... If the four assemblies observe his silence, his walking, standing, sitting, lying... all rejoice."**

---

**佛言：「阿難勝過去侍，過去侍聞說乃解，今佛未發言，阿難已解如來意，須是、不須是皆悉能知。」故以法付阿難，如來歡喜。**

**The Buddha said: "Ānanda surpasses the attendants of the past. Past attendants investigated and then understood; now before the Buddha speaks, Ānanda already understands the Tathāgata's intent..." Therefore he entrusted the Dharma to Ānanda, and the Tathāgata rejoiced.**

---

**約教者，歡喜阿難，三藏也；賢阿難，通也；典藏阿難，別也；海阿難，圓也。**

**According to the *Teachings*:**
*   **Tripiṭaka:** "Joyful Ānanda."
*   **Shared:** "Worthy Ānanda" (*Xián*).
*   **Distinct:** "Storehouse-Holder Ānanda."
*   **Perfect:** "Ocean Ānanda" (*Hǎi Ānán*).

---

**本迹者，本住非歡喜非不歡喜，法身如虛空，智慧如雲雨，能持能受。迹為歡喜也。**

**According to *Fundamental/Trace*: He abides in neither joy nor non-joy; the Dharma Body is like empty space, Wisdom like clouds and rain, able to hold and receive. His trace acts as Joy.**

---

### 21. Rāhula (羅睺羅)

**「羅睺羅」，此言覆障，往昔塞鼠穴，又不看婆羅門六日，由是緣故故言覆障。太子求出家... 菩薩指指妃腹：「却後六年，汝當生男。」在胎六年，故言覆障。**

**"Rāhula" (羅睺羅 *Luóhóuluó*): This means "Covering Obstacle" (*Fùzhàng*). In the past he blocked a mouse hole, and also did not see a Brahmin for six days. Because of these causes, he is called "Covering Obstacle." When the Crown Prince sought to leave home... the Bodhisattva pointed at his wife's belly: "After six years, you will bear a male child." He was in the womb for six years, thus "Covering Obstacle."**

---

**真諦三藏云：「羅睺，本名修羅，能手障日月，翻此應言障月。」佛言：「我法如月，此兒障我不即出家，世世障我，我世世能捨，故言覆障。」**

**Paramārtha Tripiṭaka Master said: "Rāhu originally refers to [A]sura, who can obstruct the sun and moon with his hand; this should be translated as 'Obstructing the Moon'." The Buddha said: "My Dharma is like the moon; this child obstructed me from immediately leaving home. In lifetime after lifetime he obstructed me; in lifetime after lifetime I was able to renounce, so he is called Obstacle."**

---

**行還使羅云洗足，脚挑澡盆三覆三仰，然後覆地命令注水，羅睺云：「盆覆注水不立。」佛言：「汝如覆盆，於佛法中法水不立，今當實語，勿妄語也。」**

**[Because Rāhula lied frequently as a novice:] The Buddha told Rāhula to wash his feet. [After washing,] he tipped the basin over and up three times, then covered it on the ground and ordered water to be poured on it. Rāhula said: "The basin is covered; water will not stay." The Buddha said: "You are like the covered basin; in the Buddha Dharma, the Dharma-water does not stay. Now you must speak truth; do not lie."**

---

**約教者，析法道諦障四住，三藏意也；體法道諦障四住，通教也；次第三智障五住，別教也；一心三智障五住，圓教也。**

**According to the *Teachings*:**
*   **Tripiṭaka:** Analytical Path Truth obstructing the Four Abodes [of affliction].
*   **Shared:** Embodied Path Truth obstructing the Four Abodes.
*   **Distinct:** Sequential Three Wisdoms obstructing the Five Abodes.
*   **Perfect:** One-Mind Three Wisdoms obstructing the Five Abodes.

---

**本迹者，本住中道，障塞二邊，八種障，障涅槃邊，一種障，障生死邊，一種非障生死、非障涅槃，障無餘也。**

**According to *Fundamental/Trace*: Substantially abiding in the Middle Way, obstructing and blocking the two extremes.**

---

## 7. CONCLUSION OF THE ARHATS

**「如是等」者，結句也。大數有萬二千，舉二十一人為首，其餘各有德行，不能遍以此等結之。**

**"And the like" (*rúshì děng*): This is the concluding phrase. The great number is twelve thousand; twenty-one individuals were cited as the leaders. The others each have their own virtuous conduct, but they cannot all be fully listed, so "and the like" is used to conclude it.**

---

**問：那先經說，佛未出家，與五百人為伴，佛既成道，五百人皆得羅漢，何故不但列五百，而列千二百耶？**

**Question: The *Nāgasena Sutra* says that before the Buddha left home, he was a companion to five hundred people; when the Buddha attained the Way, these five hundred all attained Arhatship. Why does [the Sutra] not just list five hundred, but lists one thousand two hundred?**

---

**答：此同類相從耳。優樓頻螺有五百弟子，伽耶、那提各二百五十，身子、目連各一百，耶舍長者子五十人，三迦葉兼師合一千五，身子師徒二百二，耶舍師徒五十一，併一千二百七十八人。**

**Answer: This is simply grouping similar categories together. Uruvilvā[-kāśyapa] had five hundred disciples; Gayā and Nadī each had two hundred and fifty. Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana each had one hundred. The Elder's Son Yaśas had fifty people. The three Kāśyapas together with their masters total one thousand and five people. Śāriputra's master and disciples total two hundred and two. Yaśas's master and disciples total fifty-one. Combined, this is 1,278 people.**

---

**言千二百者，舉大數也。此諸人等，先修外道，勤苦無益。值佛得悟，感佛恩深，常隨逐佛，給侍左右，又是同行外道，同類相隨，故遍遊諸國化導時眾。**

**Saying "one thousand two hundred" cites the round number. These people originally cultivated non-Buddhist paths with bitter diligence but no benefit. Meeting the Buddha, they attained awakening. Feeling the depth of the Buddha's grace, they constantly followed the Buddha, attending to him left and right. Furthermore, they were fellow practitioners of non-Buddhist paths, so similar categories followed one another; thus they roamed through all lands converting and guiding the contemporary multitudes.**

---

## 8. THE LEARNERS AND NO-LEARNERS (二千人)

**「復有學無學二千人」者，次列眾也。研真斷惑名為學，真窮惑盡名無學。**

**"There were also two thousand Learners and No-Learners" (*fù yǒu xué wúxué èrqiān rén*): This is the next listing of the assembly. Grinding towards the Real (*zhēn*) and severing confusion is called "Learner" (*Śaikṣa, xué*). When the Real is exhausted and confusion is ended, it is called "No-Learner" (*Aśaikṣa, wúxué*).**

---

**此二千人，是佛初成道度千二百人已，次度學無學者也。**

**These two thousand people were converted by the Buddha *after* he first attained the Way and converted the one thousand two hundred; next he converted these Learners and No-Learners.**

---

**《婆沙》問：「學人未離欲，有親愛好隨逐佛，可爾；無學已離欲，何故隨逐？」**

**The *Vibhāṣā Śāstra* asks: "Learners have not yet departed from desire and have affection; it is acceptable that they delight in following the Buddha. No-Learners have already departed from desire; why do they follow?"**

---

**答：「為報恩故，為尊重佛故，為護持佛法生人信故，為說法故，為見佛相好故，故常隨逐。」**

**Answer: "To repay grace; to honor the Buddha; to protect and uphold the Buddha-Dharma so that people generate faith; to preach the Dharma; to see the Buddha's major and minor marks. For these reasons they constantly follow."**

---

## 9. THE BHIKṢUNĪS (比丘尼)

### 22. Mahāprajāpatī (摩訶波闍波提)

**「摩訶波闍波提」，此翻大愛道，亦大世主。悉達喪母，姨用乳養得至於大，恩愛深重，故號大愛道。**

**"Mahāprajāpatī" (摩訶波闍波提 *Móhē Bōshébōtí*): Translated as "Great Path of Love" (*Dà'àidào*), or "Great Lord of the World" (*Dàshìzhǔ* - *Prajāpatī*). Siddhartha lost his mother; his aunt used her milk to raise him until he was grown. Her loving kindness was deep and heavy; thus she is called "Great Path of Love."**

---

**為大主者，亦是釋種之中大姓也，為世人所敬，故言世主。**

**As for "Great Lord": She was also of a great clan among the Śākyas, respected by the people of the world; thus she is called "World Lord."**

---

**求佛出家，佛不聽，三請不許，阿難為請亦不聽。阿難云：「佛姨母有乳養恩。」佛云：「我亦有恩於彼，令其信戒施慧，除煩惱瘡苦。」佛令行八敬，依此即得戒，不須得阿闍梨、師，即是大僧。**

**She sought the Buddha to leave home; the Buddha did not listen. She requested three times; he did not permit it. Ānanda requested on her behalf; he also did not listen. Ānanda said: "The Buddha's aunt has the grace of nursing him." The Buddha said: "I also have grace upon her: causing her to have Faith, Precepts, Giving, and Wisdom, removing the sores of affliction." The Buddha ordered her to practice the **Eight Garudhammas** (*Bājìng* - Eight Rules of Respect). Relying on this, she immediately attained the precepts. She did not need an Ācārya or Master [for ordination]; she immediately became a great monk (Bhikṣuṇī).**

---

**行八敬已，即得無漏。**

**Having practiced the Eight Rules of Respect, she immediately attained the Outflow-Free (*anāsrava*) state.**

---

**本住大乘，迹現女身，為眾之首。「與眷屬六千人」，皆是釋種，亦是同緣，從其出家。**

**According to *Fundamental*: She abides in the Mahāyāna. Her *Trace* manifests a female body, acting as the leader of the multitude. "With a retinue of six thousand people": they were all of the Śākya clan, also sharing causes and conditions, and left home following her.**

---

### 23. Yaśodharā (耶輸陀羅)

**「耶輸陀羅」，此翻華色，亦云名稱，亦云持譽。顏貌如華，種族榮華名聞遐邇。是羅睺羅母，為佛在家二妃，一是瞿夷，二耶輸。**

**"Yaśodharā" (耶輸陀羅 *Yéshūtuóluó*): Translated as "Flower Color" (*Huāsè*), or "Name/Fame" (*Míngchēng*), or "Holding Glory" (*Chíyù*). Her countenance was like a flower; her clan's glory and fame were heard near and far. She is Rāhula's mother. She was one of the Buddha's two wives when he was at home: one was Gopā (*Qúyí*), the second was Yaśodharā.**

---

**耶輸有三種：一、迹耶輸，二、本耶輸，三、觀心耶輸。**

**There are Three Kinds of Yaśodharā:**
1.  **Trace Yaśodharā** (*Jì Yéshū*)
2.  **Fundamental Yaśodharā** (*Běn Yéshū*)
3.  **Contemplating Mind Yaśodharā** (*Guānxīn Yéshū*)

---

**迹者，悉達納妃，為世法故，以神力指腹成娠，六年處胎，時人疑謗，焚火坑不燒，毒酒飯不損，皆是法身大士，迹示為母子，度魔界眾生耳。**

**As for the *Trace*: Siddhartha taking a wife was for the sake of worldly dharma. Using spiritual power he pointed at her belly to create a pregnancy. [Rāhula] dwelt in the womb for six years. Contemporaries doubted and slandered her. [She was tested by] a burning fire pit but was not burned; poisonous food and drink did not harm her. They were all Great Bodhisattvas of the Dharma Body; the trace demonstrated "mother and son" merely to liberate sentient beings in the realm of Mara.**

---

**本者，元是過去上行菩薩，與世尊誓願，世世為夫婦，引導眾生，見佛生者，見子亦生，離佛生斷，離子亦斷，為是義故，世世與佛共為因緣。**

**As for the *Fundamental*: Originally she was the Bodhisattva Visistacaritra (*Shàngxíng* - Superior Practice) in the past. She made a vow with the World Honored One to be husband and wife in lifetime after lifetime to guide sentient beings. "Those who are born [in faith] seeing the Buddha, are also born seeing the Son; those who are cut off [from faith] leaving the Buddha, are also cut off leaving the Son." For the sake of this meaning, in lifetime after lifetime she shared causes and conditions with the Buddha.**

---

**觀心者，佛譬心王，妃譬明智，子譬善動，若無智慧，心王不能發動善業。以智慧莊嚴，即生三業無漏子也。**

**As for *Contemplating the Mind*: The Buddha equates to the Mind King (*Citta-rāja*). The Wife equates to Luminous Wisdom. The Son equates to Good Action (*Kuśala-karma*). If there is no wisdom, the Mind King cannot initiate good karma. Adorned with wisdom, it immediately gives birth to the Outflow-Free Son of the Three Karmas (Body, Speech, Mind).**

---

## 10. QUESTION AND ANSWER ON THE ASSEMBLY

**問：聲聞眾中，初千二百，次二千，後六千，何故前後不多不少？**

**Question: Among the Śrāvaka assembly, first there were one thousand two hundred, next two thousand, and finally six thousand. Why are the numbers exactly this much, neither more nor less?**

---

**答：千二百者，是法門之舊舊；二千者，是法門之新舊；六千者，是法門之新新。聲聞眾有三番，故列三人。**

**Answer: The one thousand two hundred are the "Old among the Old" of the Dharma Gate. The two thousand are the "New among the Old" of the Dharma Gate. The six thousand are the "New among the New" of the Dharma Gate. The Śrāvaka assembly has three groupings, generally represented by these three.**

---

**問：聲聞列名有三，菩薩唯一，何耶？**

**Question: The Śrāvakas are listed with three groups [Arhats, Learners/No-Learners, Nuns], but the Bodhisattvas are only one group [Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas]. Why is this?**

---

**答：聲聞是佛家私眷，親教弟子，常隨從佛，形同法別，可得別列。菩薩是客眷，從他方來，形服疏散，不可備舉，故合說八萬也。**

**Answer: The Śrāvakas are the private retinue (*sījuàn*) of the Buddha's household, his personally taught disciples who constantly follow the Buddha. Their form [shaved head, robes] is the same [as the Buddha], though their Dharma [level] is different; thus they can be listed separately. The Bodhisattvas are a "guest retinue" (*kèjuàn*), coming from other directions. Their forms and clothing are diverse and scattered, and they cannot be fully enumerated; thus they are collectively said to be "eighty thousand."**

---

**問：初列比丘，次比丘尼，後優婆塞夷；何故菩薩列在尼後、清信士女前？**

**Question: First the Bhikṣus are listed, then the Bhikṣunīs, and finally the Upāsakas and Upāsikās [laymen and laywomen]. Why are the Bodhisattvas listed *after* the Nuns but *before* the laymen and laywomen?**

---

**答：此有三義。一、聲聞稟教已久，證果已久，故在前已說。菩薩雖大，稟教在後，故後說。**

**Answer: There are three meanings:**
1.  **Order of Teaching:** The Śrāvakas received the teaching long ago and verified the fruit long ago, so they are mentioned first. The Bodhisattvas, though great, received the teaching later, so they are mentioned later.

---

**二、比丘、比丘尼是親眷屬，常隨侍佛，外護內護事須在前。菩薩客寄，形雖出家，不同常隨，以其客故處中而說。**

**2.  **Kindred Relationship:** The Bhikṣus and Bhikṣunīs are the close retinue, constantly attending the Buddha. Their external protection and internal protection necessitate them being in front. The Bodhisattvas are guests. Although their form is "left-home," they do not constantly follow [like attendants]. Because they are guests, they are mentioned in the middle.**

---

**三、二眾形心俱出家，二眾形心俱在家，菩薩形在出家、心在在家，形在在家、心在出家，故處二眾之間。**

**3.  **Form and Mind:** The two assemblies [Bhikṣus/Nuns] are "left-home" in both form and mind. The two assemblies [Laymen/Laywomen] are "at-home" in both form and mind. The Bodhisattvas may be "form left-home, mind at-home" [saving beings] or "form at-home, mind left-home" [detachment]. Thus they are placed between the two groups.**

---

**「復有菩薩摩訶薩八萬人」，「摩訶」翻大，「薩埵」翻有情，亦云成眾生。**

**"There were also Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas, eighty thousand in number." "Mahā" translates as Great. "Sattva" translates as Sentient Being (*Yǒuqíng* - Having Feelings), or also "Accomplishing Sentient Beings" (*Chéng Zhòngshēng*).**

---

## 11. THE SIX AUSPICIOUS OMENS (六瑞)

**《序品》文為二：初、一經家，序如是乃至人等。二、時世尊下，是發起序，亦名證信序。**

**The text of the *Introduction Chapter* is divided into two parts:**
1.  **The Compiler's Preface:** From "Thus have I heard" to the listing of people.
2.  **The Initiating Preface:** From "At that time the World Honored One..." downwards. This is also called the "Preface Verifying Faith."

---

**發起序有六瑞：一說法，二入定，三雨華，四地動，五眾喜，六放光。**

**The Initiating Preface has Six Auspicious Omens (*Liù Ruì*):**
1.  **Expounding the Dharma** (*Shuōfǎ*)
2.  **Entering Samādhi** (*Rùdìng*)
3.  **Rain of Flowers** (*Yǔhuā*)
4.  **Earth Shaking** (*Dìdòng*)
5.  **Assembly Rejoicing** (*Zhòngxǐ*)
6.  **Emitting Light** (*Fàngguāng*)

---

**前五是集眾瑞，後一是說法瑞。**

**The first five are Omens for Gathering the Assembly. The last one [Emitting Light] is the Omen for Expounding the Dharma.**

---

### [OMEN 1: EXPOUNDING THE DHARMA] (說法瑞)

**「爾時世尊... 為諸菩薩說大乘經，名無量義」。說法瑞也。**

**"At that time, the World Honored One... for the sake of all Bodhisattvas expounded the Great Vehicle Sutra named *Immeasurable Meanings*." This is the Omen of Expounding the Dharma.[^5]**

[^5]: **Immeasurable Meanings Sutra** (*Wúliàngyì Jīng*): Traditionally regarded as the "Opening Sutra" (*Kāijīng*) for the Lotus Sutra. Zhiyi classifies it as the "Relative Truth" leading into the "Ultimate Truth" of the Lotus.

---

**所以說此經者，為顯一法流出無量法，無量法還入一法，即是《法華》無量義也。**

**The reason for preaching this sutra is to reveal that "One Dharma flows out into Immeasurable Dharmas, and Immeasurable Dharmas return to enter One Dharma." This is precisely the Immeasurable Meaning of the *Lotus Sutra*.**

---

### [OMEN 2: ENTERING SAMĀDHI] (入定瑞)

**「佛說此經已... 入于無量義處三昧」。入定瑞也。**

**"After the Buddha finished preaching this sutra... he entered the Samādhi of the Abode of Immeasurable Meanings." This is the Omen of Entering Samādhi.**

---

**處者，印也。入此三昧，印定諸法，如印印泥，無非印相。**

**"Abode" (*Chù*) means "Seal" (*Yìn*). Entering this samādhi seals and fixes all dharmas; like a seal stamping clay, there is nothing that does not bear the mark of the seal.**

---

**身心不動者，身不動，入王三昧；心不動，入數三昧。又身不動，扣寂；心不動，泯理。**

**"Body and mind unmoving":[^6]**

[^6]: **King Samādhi** (*Wáng Sānmèi*): Refers to the *Samādhi of the Lotus* itself, the "King of Samādhis." "Mind Unmoving" refers to the cessation of mental discrimination (*vikalpa*).

*   **Body unmoving:** Entering the King Samādhi (*Wáng Sānmèi*).
*   **Mind unmoving:** Entering the Number/Counting Samādhi (*Shù Sānmèi*).
*   Also: Body unmoving = Striking Stillness (*Kòu Jì*). Mind unmoving = Obliterating Principle (*Mǐn Lǐ*).

---

### [OMEN 3: RAIN OF FLOWERS] (雨華瑞)

**「是時天雨曼陀羅華...」。雨華瑞也。**

**"At that time, the heavens rained Mandārava flowers..." This is the Omen of the Rain of Flowers.**

---

**曼陀羅，此云適意，亦云白華。摩訶，翻大。曼殊沙，此云柔軟，亦云赤華。摩訶，翻大。**

**"Mandārava": This translates as "Pleasing to the Mind" (*Shìyì*), or "White Flower." "Mahā" translates as Great. "Mañjuśaka": This translates as "Soft and Flexible" (*Róuruǎn*), or "Red Flower." "Mahā" translates as Great.**

---

**適意者，表四住調柔适悅，將入圓位，見此瑞也。白者，表分段垢盡。大白者，變易垢盡。赤者，表無明行傾。大赤者，表無明行盡。**

**"Pleasing to the Mind" symbolizes that the Four Abodes [of affliction] are tuned and flexible, bringing delight; one is about to enter the Perfect Position, thus seeing this omen.**
*   **White:** Symbolizes the exhaustion of the defilement of Fragmented Birth and Death (*Fēnduàn*).
*   **Great White:** The exhaustion of the defilement of Mutated Birth and Death (*Biànyì*).
*   **Red:** Symbolizes that the activity of Ignorance (*Avidyā*) is tilting/toppling.
*   **Great Red:** Symbolizes that the activity of Ignorance is exhausted.

**由入定感四華，四華表住、行、向、地四位引發也。**

**Due to entering Samādhi, the Four Flowers are stimulated. The Four Flowers symbolize the four positions of **Abodes, Practices, Directions, and Grounds** (*Zhù, Xíng, Xiàng, Dì*) being triggered.**

---

### [OMEN 4: EARTH SHAKING] (地動瑞)

**「普佛世界六種震動」。地動瑞也。**

**"The universal Buddha World shook in six ways." This is the Omen of Earth Shaking.[^7]**

[^7]: **Six Ways:** *Dòng* (shaking), *qǐ* (rising), *yǒng* (surging) are visual; *zhèn* (quaking), *hǒu* (roaring), *jī* (cracking) are auditory. Each corresponds to purification of the six senses.


---

**六種者，動、起、涌、震、吼、擊。動、起、涌，形也；震、吼、擊，聲也。**

**As for "Six Ways": Shaking (*Dòng*), Rising (*Qǐ*), Surging (*Yǒng*), Quaking (*Zhèn*), Roaring (*Hǒu*), Cracking (*Jī*). Shaking, Rising, and Surging refer to **Form** (*Xíng*). Quaking, Roaring, and Cracking refer to **Sound** (*Shēng*).**

---

**動者，搖颺；起者，下高上低；涌者，一齊怱出。震者，隱隱有聲；吼者，雄猛之聲；擊者，磕磕破裂。**

*   **Shaking:** Swaying and oscillating.
*   **Rising:** Low parts goes up, high parts goes down (uneven movement).
*   **Surging:** Suddenly bursting out all at once.
*   **Quaking:** A hidden, rumbling sound.
*   **Roaring:** A fierce, heroic sound.
*   **Cracking:** The sound of dashing and splitting apart (*kē-kē pòliè*).

---

**又，東涌西沒、西涌東沒、南涌北沒、北涌南沒、邊涌中沒、中涌邊沒。**

**Furthermore [there are directional variations]: East surges and West sinks; West surges and East sinks; South surges and North sinks; North surges and South sinks; Borders surge and Center sinks; Center surges and Borders sink.**

---

**此依《大經》風動水、水動金、金動地。**

**This relies on the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sutra*: Directing the Wind to move the Water; the Water moves the Gold [Wheel]; the Gold moves the Earth.**

---

**表破六種無明習氣，六根清淨，六界動，六道傾，六度滿，六入開(云云)。**

**This symbolizes destroying the residual habits of the Six Kinds of Ignorance; the Six Sense Faculties becoming pure; the Six Realms shaking; the Six Paths toppling; the Six Perfections being fulfilled; the Six Entrances opening.**

---

### [OMEN 5: AUDIENCE REJOICING] (眾喜瑞)

**「爾時會中... 得未曾有，歡喜合掌，一心觀佛」。眾喜瑞也。**

**"At that time in the assembly... [they] obtained what they had never had before, rejoiced, joined their palms, and with one mind gazed at the Buddha." This is the Omen of the Assembly Rejoicing.**

---

**由見地動心生歡喜，內心歡喜發在威儀，故合掌觀佛。**

**Because they saw the earth shaking, joy arose in their minds. The inner joy expressed itself in their dignified deportment; thus they joined their palms and gazed at the Buddha.**

---

**此表四悉檀歡喜，悅動眾生機緣。**

**This symbolizes the joy of the Four Siddhāntas, delighting and moving the Catalyst (*Jī*) and Conditions (*Yuán*) of sentient beings.**

---

### [OMEN 6: EMITTING LIGHT] (放光瑞)

**「爾時佛放眉間白豪相光」。放光瑞也。**

**"At that time the Buddha emitted light from the White Hair-Pore Mark between his eyebrows." This is the Omen of Emitting Light.**

---

**豪是中道像，在此二眉之間。白是眾色之本，表圓法是諸法之本也。**

**The Hair-Pore is the image of the **Middle Way**, being between the "two eyebrows" [symbolizing the two extremes]. White is the root of all colors, symbolizing that the Perfect Dharma (*Yuánfǎ*) is the root of all dharmas.**

---

**「照東方」。東方，是震旦，群動之始，日出之方，表一乘是眾教之始也。**

**"Illuminating the East." The East is the Dawn (*Zhèndàn* - Cīna/China direction?), the beginning of all movement, the direction where the sun rises. This symbolizes that the **One Vehicle** is the beginning of all teachings.**

---

**「萬八千土」。萬八千表十八界，一一界中各有十如是，百界千如，一一界皆見一萬八千土，即顯十八空也。**

**"Eighteen thousand lands." Eighteen thousand symbolizes the **Eighteen Realms** (*Dhātu*). Within each realm, there are the Ten Suchnesses—One Hundred Realms and One Thousand Suchnesses. In each realm, one sees eighteen thousand lands; this reveals the Eighteen Emptinesses.**

---

**「靡不周遍」。表遍照一切，無所障礙也。**

**"There was nowhere not pervaded." This symbolizes illuminating everything universally without obstruction.**

---

### [ANALYSIS OF OTHER LANDS' OMENS] (光照他土六瑞)

**次明光照他土六瑞者，一見六趣，二見諸佛，即是上聖下凡為一雙，三聞佛說法，四見四眾得道，即是人法一雙，五見菩薩行行，六見佛涅槃，即是始終一雙。**

**Next, explaining the Six Omens of the Light Illuminating Other Lands:**
1.  **Seeing the Six Destinies.**
2.  **Seeing the Buddhas.** — This is the pair of **Superior Sages and Inferior Ordinary** (*Shàng Shèng Xià Fán*).
3.  **Hearing the Buddhas expound the Dharma.**
4.  **Seeing the Four Assemblies attaining the Way.** — This is the pair of **Person and Dharma** (*Rén Fǎ*).
5.  **Seeing Bodhisattvas practicing conduct.**
6.  **Seeing Buddhas entering Nirvana.** — This is the pair of **Beginning and End** (*Shǐ Zhōng*).

---

**既有可化眾生，即有能化之佛，有佛即有說法，說法即有弟子，弟子即是行始，行始必致終也。**

**Since there are sentient beings to be transformed (*Kě Huà*), there are Buddhas who can transform (*Néng Huà*). Having Buddhas, there is Expounding Dharma. Having Dharma, there are Disciples. Disciples are the Beginning of Practice. Practice must lead to the End [Nirvana].**

---

**若此土六瑞，總報眾生當獲自覺；彼土六瑞，總報眾生當獲覺他。又此彼六瑞，表此彼諸佛道同。**

**The Six Omens of **This Land** generally signal that sentient beings will obtain **Self-Enlightenment** (*Zì Jué*). The Six Omens of **That [Other] Land** generally signal that sentient beings will obtain **Enlightenment of Others** (*Jué Tā*). Moreover, the Six Omens of here and there symbolize that **The Way of All Buddhas is the Same** (*Zhū Fó Dào Tóng*).[^10]**

[^10]: **Self-Enlightenment vs. Enlightening Others:** This Land's omens (shaking, raining flowers) happen *here*, signaling the assembly's own awakening. The Light shines *there*, revealing the Buddha's work of saving others, signaling the Bodhisattva practice of enlightening others.

---

**更廣說者，從又見六趣眾生，是現彼佛為五濁故出現於世，此佛亦然，二土出世意同也。**

**Speaking more widely: "Seeing sentient beings of the six destinies" reveals that the Buddha of that land appears in the world because of the Five Turbidities (*Wǔ Zhuó*); **This Buddha** is also like this. The intent of appearing in the world in the two lands is the same.**

---

**及「聞諸佛所說經」者，是現彼佛初從無相一法非頓而頓，與此土初說《華嚴》意同也。**

**And "Hearing the Sutras expounded by the Buddhas" reveals that the Buddha of that land, from the single Dharma of Marklessness (*Wú Xiàng*), manifests "Non-Sudden yet Sudden" (*Fēi Dùn Ér Dùn*); this is the same intent as **This Land** initially expounding the *Avataṃsaka Sutra* (*Huáyán*).[^11]**

[^11]: **Non-Sudden yet Sudden:** Refers to the *Avataṃsaka* (Flower Adornment) period. It is "Sudden" (high-level teaching) but "Non-Sudden" in that it comes from the markless dharmakaya. Or, it matches the *Distinct* and *Perfect* teachings (Sudden) but is preached in a specific location (Non-Sudden/Gradual context).

---

**從「并見諸比丘」下，是現彼佛非漸而漸，與此土佛次說三藏意同也。**

**From "Also seeing the Bhikṣus" downwards, reveals that the Buddha of that land manifests "Non-Gradual yet Gradual" (*Fēi Jiàn Ér Jiàn*); this is the same intent as the Buddha of **This Land** next expounding the **Tripiṭaka** (*Sānzàng*).**

---

**從「復見諸菩薩」下，是彼佛三藏之後，說方等、《般若》眾經，與此土佛三藏之後意同也。**

**From "Also seeing the Bodhisattvas" downwards, [reveals] that after the Tripiṭaka, the Buddha of that land expounds the *Vaipulya* (*Fāngděng*) and *Prajñā* (*Bōrě*) Sutras; this is the same intent as the Buddha of **This Land** after the Tripiṭaka.**

---

**從「復見諸佛」下，至「起七寶塔」，是現彼佛般若之後開權顯實，收無量法還入一法，唱入涅槃息化起塔，光照彼土始終究竟炳然在目。**

**From "Also seeing the Buddhas" down to "building Stupas of Seven Jewels," reveals that the Buddha of that land, after the *Prajñā*, **Opens the Provisional and Reveals the Real** (*Kāi Quán Xiǎn Shí*), gathers immeasurable dharmas to return into One Dharma, announces entry into Nirvana, ceases transformation, and raises Stupas. The light illuminating that land makes the **Beginning and End** (*Shǐ Zhōng*) and **Ultimate** (*Jiūjìng*) distinct and visible.**

---

**當知此土從一出無量，非頓而頓、非漸而漸，其事已竟，必當收無量法還入一法，開權顯實、息化歸真，與彼土同也。**

**One should know that in **This Land**, "From One produces Immeasurable," "Non-Sudden yet Sudden, Non-Gradual yet Gradual"—these matters are already concluded. It must be that [the Buddha] will "Gather Immeasurable Dharmas to return into One Dharma," "Open the Provisional and Reveal the Real," and "Cease Transformation and Return to Truth" (*Xī Huà Guī Zhēn*); this is the same as in That Land.**

---

**復次種種因緣者，昔善為因，今教為緣。**

**Furthermore, regarding "various causes and conditions": Past good deeds are **Causes** (*Yīn*); present teachings are **Conditions** (*Yuán*).**

---

## 12. PREFACE OF DOUBT (疑念序)

**「爾時彌勒作是念」訖「今當問誰」，是疑念序，文為兩：一、彌勒疑念，二、大眾疑念。**

**From "At that time Maitreya had this thought" to "Now whom shall I ask," this is the Preface of Doubting Thoughts (*Yí Niàn Xù*). The text has two parts: 1. Maitreya's Doubting Thoughts; 2. The Great Assembly's Doubting Thoughts.**

---

**彌勒有三念：一、正念六瑞，二、念問誰，三、念文殊。文殊念起，第二念除，唯初念在，但成一疑也。**

**Maitreya has three thoughts: 1. Directly pondering the Six Omens; 2. Pondering whom to ask; 3. Pondering Manjuśrī. When the thought of Manjuśrī arises, the second thought ["Whom to ask"] is removed; only the first thought [the Doubt itself] remains, thus forming a single Doubt.**

---

**「神變」者，神，內也；變，外也。神名天心，即是天然內慧；變名變動，即是六瑞外彰。**

**"Spiritual Transformation" (*Shén Biàn* - Vikurvaṇa): *Shén* (Spirit) is Internal; *Biàn* (Transformation) is External. *Shén* is called the "Heavenly Mind" (*Tiān Xīn*), which is the natural internal wisdom. *Biàn* is called "Transformation/Movement," which is the external manifestation of the Six Omens.**

---

**《首楞嚴》云：佛住不二法，能作神通，法王法力超蓋一切。**

**The *Śūraṅgama [Samādhi] Sutra* says: "The Buddha abides in the Non-Dual Dharma and can create spiritual powers (*abhijñā*). The Dharma Power of the Dharma King surpasses and covers everything."**

---

**彌勒不測外變，亦不知內慧，故興念至此...**

**Maitreya cannot fathom the external transformations, nor does he know the internal wisdom; thus he gives rise to thought [doubt] on this...**

---

**若夫庸人不知術者，散人不知定者，凡人不知聖者，小聖不知身子，身子不知菩薩，菩薩不知補處，補處不知尊極，此就極處亦不知也。**

**[Hierarchy of Knowing]: Mediocre people don't know techniques... Scattered people don't know Samādhi... Worldly people don't know Sages... Small Sages don't know Śāriputra (**Small Sage**: Arhats/Pratyekabuddhas)... Śāriputra doesn't know Bodhisattvas... Bodhisattvas don't know the Successor (Maitreya)... The Successor doesn't know the Most Honored One (Buddha). This means even at the highest place, he does not know.[^12]**

[^12]: **Hierarchy of Knowledge:** Zhiyi lists seven levels of understanding (Commoner → Scattered → Worldly → Small Sage → Śāriputra → Bodhisattva → Successor). Each level is "ignorant" compared to the one above it. Thus, even Maitreya does not fully know the Buddha's intent.

---

**又彌勒值佛植善既多，何容不髣髴知？應須隱明示闇，權言不知也。**

**Furthermore, Maitreya has met [many] Buddhas and planted much goodness; how could he not even vaguely know? It must be that he **"Hides Brightness and Displays Darkness"** (*Yǐn Míng Shì Àn*), provisionally saying he does not know.**

---

**大眾有兩念：一、正念六瑞，二、念問誰...**

**The Assembly has two thoughts: 1. Directly pondering Six Omens; 2. Pondering whom to ask. ... [Explanation omitted] ... Here [in prose] the third thought is absent, to push the Successor [Maitreya] to be first.**

---

**問：文殊、彌勒德位相亞，何故一問一答？**

**Question: Manjuśrī and Maitreya are equal in virtue and position (*Dé Wèi Xiāng Yà*). Why is it one asks and one answers?**

---

**答：夫機有在無，位雖齊等，賓主異宜，聖人承機非問者不能答也。**

**Answer: Catalyst (*Jī*) exists or not. Although positions are equal, Host and Guest have different suitabilities. The Sage responds to the Catalyst; if there is no questioner, he cannot answer.**

---

**又法門有權實，權補處須問，實者須答。**

**Also, Dharma Gates have **Provisional** (*Quán*) and **Real** (*Shí*). The Provisional [Maitreya] Successor must ask; the Real One [Manjuśrī] must answer.[^13]**

[^13]: **Provisional asking Real:** Maitreya represents the *position* of Successor (Future Buddha), thus "Provisional." Manjuśrī represents the *wisdom* of Past Buddhas (Dragon Seed), thus "Real."

---

**又迹有久近，近問久答。**

**Also, Traces have **Long/Old** and **Near/New**. The Near [Maitreya, new successor] asks; the Long [Manjuśrī, past Buddha] answers.**

---

**又名有便易，彌勒名慈，慈為眾生應須問；文殊名妙德，德應須答。**

**Also, Names have appropriateness. Maitreya is named "Compassion" (*Cí*); Compassion for sentient beings means he must ask. Manjuśrī is named "Wondrous Virtue" (*Miào Dé*); Virtue means he must answer.**

---

**此即四種消文意。**

**These are the four meanings of interpreting the text.**
