## 6. THE LIST OF ARHATS (Continued)

### 11. Gavāmpati (憍梵波提)

**「憍梵波提」，此翻牛呞，《無量壽》稱牛王，《增一》云：「牛跡，昔五百世曾為牛王，牛若食後，恒事虛哨；餘報未夷，唼唼常嚼，時人稱為牛呞。」**

**"Gavāmpati" (憍梵波提 *Jiāofànbōtí*):[^1] Translated as "Cow Ruminate" (*Niú Shī*). The *Immeasurable Life Sutra* calls him "Ox King." The *Ekottara Āgama* says: "[Regarding] trace-actions like an ox: in the past for five hundred lifetimes he was an ox king. When an ox finishes eating, it constantly engages in empty chewing (ruminating). Because his residual retribution was not yet extinguished, he made a *shà-shà* sound, constantly chewing. Contemporaries called him 'Cow Ruminate'."**

[^1]: **Gavāmpati:** Represents the purification of oral karma. Even an Arhat retains the "trace" (*vāsanā*) of past habits, though the defilement is gone.

---

**昔五百雁，一雁常得花果，供於雁王，佛一夏受阿耆達王請，五百比丘皆噉馬麥，而憍梵獨在天上尸利沙園，受天王供養。**

**In the past, among five hundred wild geese, one goose always obtained flowers and fruits to offer to the Goose King. [Later,] when the Buddha accepted the invitation of King Agnidatta regarding the summer retreat, five hundred bhikṣus all ate horse-fodder, yet Gavāmpati alone was in the Śirīṣa Garden[^2] in the heavens, receiving offerings from the Heavenly King.**

[^2]: **Śirīṣa Garden:** The garden of the Acacia trees in the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven.

---

**《增一》云：「樂在天上，不樂人間者，牛跡比丘第一。」**

**The *Ekottara Āgama* says: "Among those who delight in being in the heavens and do not delight in the human world, the Bhikṣu 'Ox-Traces' [Gavāmpati] is foremost."**

---

**樂在天上者，是隨樂欲，世界悉檀也；供雁王福所致者，為人也；避人笑者，對治也；天不笑者，第一義也(云云)。**

**"Delighting in being in the heavens" corresponds to following desires and preferences—this is the *Worldly Siddhānta*. "Caused by the merit of offering to the Goose King" corresponds to the *Individual Siddhānta*. "Avoiding the ridicule of humans" corresponds to the *Therapeutic Siddhānta*. "The gods do not ridicule" corresponds to the *Ultimate Siddhānta*.[^3]**

[^3]: **Four Siddhāntas Application:** Zhiyi applies his hermeneutical key to every disciple. Gavāmpati's residence in heaven is not just a quirk; it fulfills all four teaching modes.

---

**又云：「人但觀形不知有德，若笑羅漢即得罪，避人笑故常居天上，天知有德不笑其形，故居天也。」**

**Furthermore, it is said: "Humans only observe the form and do not know he possesses virtue. If they were to ridicule an Arhat, they would incur sin. Therefore, to avoid human ridicule, he constantly dwells in the heavens. The gods know he possesses virtue and do not ridicule his form; thus he dwells in the heavens."**

---

**佛滅度後，迦葉集千大羅漢，遣下座僧使追憍梵，憍梵問：「佛及和尚。」答言：「皆滅。」即言：「佛出我出，佛住我住，佛滅我滅。」**

**After the Buddha's Parinirvāṇa, [Mahā-]Kāśyapa gathered a thousand great Arhats and dispatched a junior monk to summon Gavāmpati. Gavāmpati asked: "What of the Buddha and my Preceptor (*upādhyāya*)?" The reply was: "They have both entered extinction." He immediately said: "When the Buddha appears, I appear; when the Buddha abides, I abide; when the Buddha enters extinction, I enter extinction."**

---

**四道流注大迦葉所，水說偈(云云)：「大象既去象子隨，世尊和尚既滅度，我今在此復何為？」斯亦第一義也。**

**Four streams [from his body] flowed to the place of Mahākāśyapa, and the water spoke a verse: "Since the great elephant has departed, the young elephant follows. Since the World Honored One and the Preceptor have entered extinction, why should I remain here now?" This is also the *Ultimate Siddhānta*.**

---

**約教者，住天園是示善，有牛嚼是示惡，三藏意也。以牛嚼身得道，此示惡非惡也，居天園而嚼，示善非善，通教意。示界內外善惡者，別教意。示善惡實相者，圓教意。**

**According to the *Teachings* (*yuējiào* 約教):**
*   **Tripiṭaka:** Dwelling in the heavenly garden demonstrates good; having cow-chewing [habits] demonstrates evil.
*   **Shared (Tong):** Attaining the Way with a cow-chewing body demonstrates that evil is not [inherently] evil; chewing while dwelling in a heavenly garden demonstrates that good is not [inherently] good.
*   **Distinct (Bie):** Demonstrating the good and evil of both the mundane (within the realms) and supramundane (outside the realms).
*   **Perfect (Yuan):** Demonstrating the **Reality Mark** (*shíxiàng*) of good and evil.

---

### 12. Revata (離婆多)

**「離婆多」，亦云離越，此翻星宿，或室宿，或假和合，《文殊問經》稱常作聲。**

**"Revata" (離婆多 *Lípódūo*): Also called Li-yue. Translated as "Constellation" (*Xīngxiù*),[^4] or "House Constellation" (*Shìxiù*), or "False Union" (*Jiǎhéhé*). The *Mañjuśrī Inquiry Sutra* calls him "Constantly Making Sound."**

[^4]: **Constellation:** From Sanskrit *Revatī* (a nakṣatra).

---

**父母從星辰乞子，既其感獲因星作名，雖得出家猶隨本字。**

**His parents begged for a child from the stars (*xīngchén*). Since they obtained him through this response, they named him after the star. Although he left home [to become a monk], he still followed his original name.**

---

**假和合者，有人引《釋論》，空亭中宿，見二鬼爭屍，告其分判。設依理、枉理俱不免害，故隨實而答。大鬼拔其手足，小鬼取屍補之，食竟，拭口而去。其因煩惱不測誰身故，言假和合。**

**As for "False Union": Someone cites the *Dazhilun* (Māhaprajñāpāramitā-śāstra): spending the night in an empty pavilion, he saw two ghosts fighting over a corpse and they asked him to judge [whose it was]. Whether he relied on reason or twisted reason, he could not avoid harm, so he answered according to the facts. The big ghost ripped off his hands and feet; the small ghost took [limbs from] the corpse to patch him up. When they finished eating [his original limbs], they wiped their mouths and left. Because of his distress at not fathom whose body this was, it is called "False Union."**

---

**常作聲者，其疑此事，若我本身眼見拔去，若是他身復隨我行住。疑惑猶豫逢人即問：「汝見我身不？」故言常作聲。**

**As for "Constantly Making Sound": He doubted this matter—"If it was my original body, I saw it ripped away generally. If it is another's body, it now follows me in walking and dwelling." Doubting and hesitating, whenever he met someone he would ask: "Do you see my body or not?" Thus it is said he "Constantly Making Sound."**

---

**眾僧云：「此人易度。」語云：「汝身本是他遺體，非己有也。」即得道也(云云)。《增一》云：「坐禪入定，心不倒亂者，離越比丘第一。」**

**The multitude of monks said: "This person is easily liberated." They told him: "Your body was originally the remnants of another; it is not your own possession." He immediately attained the Way. The *Ekottara Āgama* says: "Among those who sit in meditation (*dhyāna*) entering samādhi with a mind not inverted or scattered, the Bhikṣu Revata is foremost."**

*[Critical apparatus: [12] 辰【大】，神【甲】; [A1] 己【CB】，已【大】; [13] 道【大】，道也【甲】]*

---

**約教言，析破五陰非我所有，三藏意。體達五陰本非我有，通意。分別十法界、五陰皆非己有，別意。達五陰非我有、非他有，見陰實相，即圓意。**

**According to the *Teachings*:**
*   **Tripiṭaka:** Analytically destroying the Five Aggregates as not "my" possession.
*   **Shared:** Embodying the understanding that the Five Aggregates are originally not "mine."
*   **Distinct:** Discriminating that the Five Aggregates of the Ten Dharma Realms are all not "one's own possession."

### 13. Pilindavatsa (畢陵伽婆蹉)

**「畢陵伽婆蹉」，此翻餘習，五百世為婆羅門，餘氣猶高，過恒水：「咄！小婢駐流。」**

**"Pilindavatsa" (畢陵伽婆蹉 *Bìlíngqiápócuō*): Translated as "Residual Habit" (*Yúxí*). For five hundred lifetimes he was a Brahmin, and his residual arrogance (*yúqì*) was still high. Crossing the Ganges River, he said: "Hey! Little Maid, stop the flow!"**

---

**恒神為之兩派。神往訴佛，佛令懺謝，即合手：「小婢莫瞋。」大眾笑之，懺而更罵。佛言：「本習如此，實無高心。」《增一》云：「樹下苦坐，不避風雨者，婆蹉比丘第一。」**

**The River Goddess parted the stream for him. The spirit went to complain to the Buddha. The Buddha ordered him to apologize. He immediately joined his palms: "Little Maid, do not be angry." The great assembly laughed at him—apologizing yet scolding again! The Buddha said: "His original habit is like this; effectively he has no arrogant mind." The *Ekottara Āgama* says: "Among those who sit in bitter practice under trees, avoiding neither wind nor rain, the Bhikṣu Vatsa is foremost."**

*[Critical apparatus: [＊7-3] 笑【大】＊，咲【甲】＊]*

---

*   **Shared:** [Realizing] pride itself is no-pride (*jí màn wú màn*).
*   **Distinct:** Discriminating the highs and lows of the Ten Dharma Realms.

**According to *Fundamental and Trace*:**
*   **Fundamental:** Abiding in the Eternity, Bliss, Self, and Purity (Four Virtues) and the Eight Self-Existences; the subtle Brahma voice.

*   Contemplating that coarse speech and soft words both return to the Ultimate Truth (*Dìyīyì*).

### 14. Vakkula (薄拘羅)

**「薄拘羅」者，此翻善容，或偉形，或大肥盛，或腬囊，或楞鄧，或賣性，然而色貌端正，故言善容也。**

**"Vakkula" (薄拘羅 *Bójūluó*): Translated as "Good Countenance" (*Shànróng*), or "Great Form," or "Great Fatness/Prosperity," or "Soft Bag," or "Leng-deng," or "Selling Nature." However, because his physical appearance was upright and correct, it is called "Good Countenance."**

---

**年一百六十歲，無病無夭，有五不死報。後母置熬盤釜中、水中，魚食、刀破皆不死，昔持不殺戒故，九十一劫命不中夭。**

**He was one hundred and sixty years old, without sickness or premature death, possessing the retribution of "Five Undying States." His stepmother placed him in a roasting pan/cauldron, in water, [he was] eaten by a fish, [the fish was] cut by a knife—in all cases he did not die. Because in the past he upheld the precept against killing, for ninety-one kalpas his life was not cut short.**

---

**昔施僧一訶梨勒果故，身常無病，能持一戒、四戒莊嚴，堅持不犯不避火水，餘人雖持五戒，多毀犯也(云云)。**

**Because in the past he gave one Haritaki fruit to the Saṃgha, his body was constantly without sickness. He was able to hold "One Precept" [against killing] and adorned with "Four Precepts"; holding them firmly without transgression, he did not [need to] avoid fire or water. Other people, though they hold the five precepts, mostly violate them.**

---

**身樂寂靜，常處閑居，不樂眾中，眼不樂玄黃等色，耳不樂聞世間之聲，鼻不嗅世間香臭，舌不曾為人說一兩句語，意常在禪定不散亂，乃至舍利塔亦樂閑靜。**

**His body delighted in stillness; he constantly dwelt in secluded leisure, not delighting in crowds. His eyes did not delight in dark and yellow and the like; his ears did not delight in hearing the sounds of the world; his nose did not smell the world's fragrances and stench; his tongue never once spoke even one or two sentences for other people; his mind was constantly in dhyāna-samādhi without scattering. Even his śarīra stupa also delighted in secluded stillness.**

---

**阿育王禮諸羅漢塔，次至其塔而說偈言：「雖自練無明，於世少利益。」供二十貝子。《增一》云：「施一錢而貝子從塔飛出，來著王足。諸臣驚怪，閑靜少欲乃至其塔猶有是力故。」《增一》云：「壽命極長終不中夭，常樂閑居，不處眾中，薄拘羅第一。」**

**King Aśoka paid homage to the stupas of the Arhats. When he came next to [Vakkula's] stupa, he spoke a verse: "Although he trained himself in [removing] ignorance, he was of little benefit to the world." He offered twenty cowrie shells. The *Ekottara Āgama* says: "He offered one coin [cowrie], and the cowrie flew out from the stupa and attached itself to the King's foot. The ministers were astonished—even his stupa had such power of leisure, stillness, and few desires." The *Ekottara* says: "Among those of extremely long life never cut short, constantly delighting in leisure dwelling and not abiding in crowds, Vakkula is foremost."**

---

### 15. Mahākauṣṭhila (摩訶拘絺羅)

**「摩訶拘絺羅」，此翻大膝，舍利弗舅，由來論勝姊。姊孕，論則不勝，知所懷者，智寄辯尚爾，何況出胎？(云云)即棄家往南天竺，讀十八經。**

**"Mahākauṣṭhila" (摩訶拘絺羅 *Móhē Jūchīluó*): Translated as "Big Knee" (*Dàxī*). He was Śāriputra's uncle. Formerly he won arguments against his sister. When his sister was pregnant, he could not win arguments [against her]. He knew that the one she carried [Śāriputra] was wise—if the eloquence borrowed [by the unborn child] was like this, how much more so after birth? He immediately abandoned his home and went to South India to read the eighteen classics.**

---

**時人笑之：「累世難通，一生非冀。」喟然歎曰：「在家為姊所勝，出路為他所輕。」誓讀不休，無暇剪爪，時人呼為長爪梵志。**

**Contemporaries ridiculed him: "[These texts] are difficult to master over consecutive lifetimes; one lifetime is not enough to hope for it." He gathered his breath and sighed: "At home I was defeated by my sister; on the road I am slighted by others." He vowed to read without resting, having no time to cut his nails. Contemporaries called him the "Long-Nail Brahmin" (*Dīrghanakha*).**

---

**學訖還家，問甥所在，人云：「為佛弟子。」即大憍慢：「我甥八歲聲震五竺，彼沙門者有何道術誘我姊子？」徑往佛所，思惟良久，不得一法入心，語佛言：「一切法不忍，忍即安義，此言一切法我皆能破，使不得安故，言一切法不忍。」**

**Finishing his studies, he returned home and asked where his nephew was. People said: "He is a disciple of the Buddha." He became greatly arrogant: "My nephew at age eight shook the Five Indias with his voice. What method does that Śramaṇa [Buddha] have to seduce my sister's son?" He went directly to the Buddha. He thought for a long time but could not get a single dharma into his mind. He told the Buddha: "I do not endure (*ren*, accept/sanction) all dharmas." (*Ren* implies 'peace/stability'; this means "I can destroy all dharmas so they cannot find stability," thus "I do not accept all dharmas.")**

---

**佛問：「汝見是忍不？」此墮兩負處：若我見忍，前已云：「一切不忍。」若我見不忍，無以勝佛，即低頭，得法眼淨。身子扇佛聞舅論，得阿羅漢果。《增一》云：「得四辯才，觸難能答，拘絺羅第一。」南方天王毘留匐叉常來隨侍。**

**The Buddha asked: "Do you 'accept' this accepting [or not accepting]?" Here he fell into a double defeat: if I say, "I accept [this]," earlier I already said, "I do not accept all [dharmas]." If I say, "I do not accept [this]," then I have no way to defeat the Buddha. He immediately lowered his head and attained the Purity of the Dharma Eye. Śāriputra, who was fanning the Buddha and heard his uncle's debate, attained the fruit of Arhatship. The *Ekottara Āgama* says: "Among those who attain the Four Eloquences and, when confronted with difficulties, are able to answer, Kauṣṭhila is foremost." The Southern Heavenly King Virūpākṣa constantly came to attend him.**

**"Nanda" (難陀 *Nántuó*): Also called "Cowherding Nanda." Translated as "Good Joy" (*Shàn Huānxǐ*) or "Delight" (*Xīnlè*). King Śuddhodana forced ten thousand Śākyas to leave home [to become monks]; he was one of them. Some masters say: "This is the Upananda (*Bá-nántuó*) mentioned in the Vinaya."**

### 17. Sundarananda (孫陀羅難陀)

**「孫陀羅難陀」，孫陀羅，此翻好愛，亦端正，難陀如前，種姓如那律中說。**

**"Sundarananda" (孫陀羅難陀 *Sūntuóluó Nántuó*): "Sundara" is translated as "Beautiful Love" (*Hǎo'ài*) or "Upright/Correct." "Nanda" is as before. His lineage is as described in the account of Aniruddha.**

---

**四月九日生，短佛四指，容儀挺特與世殊異，若入眾中有不識者，謂言佛來。**

**He was born on the ninth day of the fourth month. He was four fingers shorter than the Buddha. His appearance was outstanding and different from the world; if he entered an assembly and there were those who did not recognize him, they would say "The Buddha has come."**

---

**《彌沙塞律》云：「摩竭有裸形外道，大聰明，國人號為智者、見者，共身子論議，結舌，善心生，欲於佛法出家。見難陀色貌姝偉，歎云：『短小比丘智慧難概，況堂堂者乎？』難陀即度出家。」**

**The *Mahīśāsaka Vinaya* says: "In Magadha there was a naked ascetic (*Nirgrantha*), greatly intelligent; people called him 'The Wise One, The Seer.' He debated with Śāriputra, became tongue-tied, and a good mind arose; he wished to leave home in the Buddha's Dharma. Seeing Nanda's magnificent appearance, he sighed: 'If the wisdom of a short, small bhikṣu [like Śāriputra] is hard to measure, how much more so this imposing one?' Nanda immediately ordained him."**

---

**婦即孫陀利，極端正，食息不相離。佛與阿難途行乞食到其門，正共婦在高樓食，即起迎佛，婦言：『須君還乃共食耳。』白佛言：『轉輪王種云何自辱？』持佛鉢取飯。**

**His wife was Sundarī (*Sūntuólì*), extremely upright and beautiful; in eating and resting they never separated. The Buddha and Ānanda were begging for food and arrived at his gate. He was just eating with his wife in a high tower. He immediately rose to welcome the Buddha. His wife said: 'I must wait for my lord to return before we eat together.' He said to the Buddha: 'How can a Wheel-Turning King's seed disgrace himself [by begging]?' He took the Buddha's bowl to get rice.**

**佛即還尼俱類園，語阿難：『令難陀送食來。』阿難宣佛旨，令其送飯奉佛，佛令剃頭，握拳語剃者：『勿持刀臨閻浮提王頂。』佛逼不得止，乃剃頭。明日佛與五百比丘應請，求住守寺，意欲逃去。佛令關房掃地，關南北開，掃此彼污。復懼佛歸，即逃走歸去。於路值佛，屏身隱樹，樹逈升空，佛見即喚將還。問：『何故去？』即答：『昨與婦別，待還乃食。憶婦去耳。』佛將遊天堂、地獄(云云)。」故以婦字標之。**

**The Buddha then returned to the Nyagrodha Garden and said to Ānanda: "Have Nanda bring the meal." Ānanda proclaimed the Buddha's instruction and had him deliver the food as an offering to the Buddha. The Buddha then ordered his head to be shaved. [Nanda] clenched his fist and said to the barber: "Do not bring a knife near the crown of the King of Jambudvīpa!" The Buddha pressed him and he could not stop it; thus his head was shaved.**

**On the next day, the Buddha and five hundred bhikṣus were invited [to a meal]. [Nanda] requested to remain behind to guard the monastery, intending to flee. The Buddha ordered his room shut and told him to sweep the floor: the south [door] was shut and the north opened, and he was made to sweep this side and that side of the filth. Again he feared the Buddha's return, so he ran away and went back home. On the road he encountered the Buddha. He hid himself behind a tree, and the tree suddenly rose into the sky. Seeing him, the Buddha immediately called him and brought him back. [The Buddha] asked: "Why did you leave?" He replied: "Yesterday I separated from my wife; I was waiting to return and only then eat. I merely missed my wife, so I left." The Buddha took him to tour the heavens and hells (and so on)." Therefore, he marks this [entry] with the character "wife."**

### 18. Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra (富樓那)

**「富樓那」，翻滿願；彌多羅，翻慈；尼，女也。父於滿江禱梵天求子，正值江滿，又夢七寶器，盛滿中寶入母懷，母懷子，父願獲滿，從諸遂願，故言滿願。**

**"Pūrṇa" (富樓那 *Fùlóunà*) translates as "Full Wish" (*Mǎnyuàn*). "Maitrāyaṇī" translates as "Compassion" (*Cí*); "nī" means woman. His father prayed to Brahmā for a son by the Full River (Gangā?); it just happened the river was full. He also dreamt of a seven-jeweled vessel filled with treasures entering the mother's womb. Because the father's wish was fulfilled, he is called "Full Wish."**

---

**母名彌多羅尼，此翻慈行，亦云知識。四韋陀有此品，其母誦之，以此為名。尼者女也，通稱女為尼，通稱男為那，既是慈之所生故言慈子。《增一》云：「我父名滿，我母名慈，諸梵行人呼我為滿慈子。」此從父母兩緣得名，故云滿慈子。是人善知，內外經書靡所不知，就知滿故復名滿。**

**His mother was named Maitrāyaṇī (*Míduōluóní*), translated as "Compassionate Practice" (*Cíxíng*) or also "Good Friend/Spiritual Friend" (*Zhīshì*). The Four Vedas contain this section; his mother recited it and took it as her name. "Nī" means "woman": in general, women are called *nī*, and men are called *nà*. Since he was born from "Compassion" (*maitrī*), he is called "Son of Compassion" (*Cízǐ*). The *Ekottara Āgama* says: "My father was named Full, my mother was named Compassion; the pure practitioners call me Full-Compassion Son."**

**This name is obtained from the two conditions of father and mother, therefore he is called "Full-Compassion Son." He was good at knowing: among internal and external scriptures and books there was nothing he did not know. Because his knowledge was "full," he was again named "Full."**

**《增一》云：「善能廣說分別義理，滿願子最第一。」下文云：「於說法人中最為第一。」第一者，說滿字也。**

**The *Ekottara* says: "In skillfully expounding and analyzing principles, the Son of Full Wish is foremost." The text below [in the *Lotus Sutra*] says: "Among those who preach the Dharma, he is foremost." "Foremost" means he preaches the Full Word (*mǎnzì* - Mahāyāna), not just the Half Word.**

---

**欲還本國利益，佛言：「彼國弊惡，汝云何？」答：「我當修忍，若毀辱我，我當自幸不得拳歐，拳歐時自幸不得木杖，木杖時自幸不得刀刃，刀刃時自幸離五陰毒器。」是為行忍滿，故名滿。**

**He wished to return to his native land to benefit others. The Buddha said: "That country is vile and evil; what will you do?" He replied: "I will cultivate patience (*kṣānti*). If they insult and revile me, I will count myself lucky that they do not strike me with their fists. If they do strike me with their fists, I will count myself lucky that they do not use wooden staffs. If they do use wooden staffs, I will count myself lucky that they do not use knife-blades. If they do use knife-blades, I will count myself lucky that I will be separated from this poisonous vessel of the Five Aggregates." This is called the fulfillment of the practice of patience; therefore he is named "Full."**

---

**《七車喻經》中說：「為大智舍利弗所稱歎，一切梵行人皆當縈衣頂戴於汝，若見汝者得大利益。」是為歎滿，故名滿。**

**In the *Sutra of the Parable of the Seven Carts*, it is said: "Praised by the great-wisdom [one], Śāriputra: all pure-practice people (*brahmacārins*) should wrap their robes and place [them] on their heads before you; if they see you, they obtain great benefit." This is called praising "Full"; therefore he is named "Full."**

---

**約教者，殷勤析法，所作已辦，三藏願滿；體達即空，於空法得證，通教願滿；法眼具足，別教願滿；住祕密藏，圓教願滿。**

### 19. Subhūti (須菩提)

**「須菩提」，此翻空生，生時家中倉庫筐篋器皿一切皆空。問占者，占者言吉。因空而生，字曰空生。從依報器皿瑞空以名正報，依正俱吉，故言空生也。常修空行故言善業。若供養者得現報故，故言善吉。**

**"Subhūti" (須菩提 *Xūpútí*): Translated as "Empty Born" (*Kōngshēng*). When he was born, the storehouses, baskets, and vessels in his home were all empty. They asked a diviner; the diviner said it was auspicious (*jí*). Because he was born due to emptiness, he was named "Empty Born." He takes the auspicious "emptiness" of the dependent retribution (the vessels) and uses it to name the direct retribution (the person): dependent and direct are both auspicious, therefore he is called "Empty Born."**

**Because he constantly cultivated the practice of emptiness, he is called "Good Deeds/Good Practice." Because those who make offerings obtain immediate recompense, he is also called "Good Auspiciousness."**

**常樂遊止閑林石窟寂靜之處，所修行業以空為本，常入空定住無諍三昧，喜說空法，有所宣辯皆分別空。將護眾生不令起礙，嫌行即住，嫌住即行。**

**He constantly delighted in roaming and dwelling in secluded forests and stone caves, quiet places. The practices he cultivated took emptiness as their root. He constantly entered the emptiness samādhi and abode in the **Samādhi of No-Dispute** (*Araṇa*). He delighted in preaching the Dharma of emptiness; whatever he proclaimed and argued, all was discriminating emptiness. Wishing to protect sentient beings and not allow obstructions to arise: if they disliked his walking, he would stop; if they disliked his stopping, he would walk.**

---

**佛忉利下，率土輻湊爭前頂禮，端坐石室念諸法空，色非佛乃至識非佛，眼非佛乃至意非佛，豁然悟道。佛告蓮華比丘尼：「非汝前禮，汝禮色身；須菩提前見法身。」**

**When the Buddha descended from the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven, the whole land gathered like spokes converging on a hub, vying to be first to bow. [Subhūti] sat upright in his stone chamber, contemplating the emptiness of all dharmas: "Form is not the Buddha - up to and including Consciousness is not the Buddha. The eye is not the Buddha - up to and including the mind is not the Buddha." Suddenly he awakened to the Way. The Buddha told the bhikṣuṇī Utpalavarṇā (蓮華): "It was not you who bowed first. You bowed to the form-body. Subhūti first saw the Dharma-body."**

---

**約教者，自有滅色空智生，體色空智生，從有智生空智，從空智生俗智，從俗智生中智，空生即有智，是圓空智生，而今是圓空智生也。**

**According to the *Teachings*: there is "Emptiness-wisdom born from extinguishing form" (Tripiṭaka); "Emptiness-wisdom born from embodying form" (Shared); "from being-wisdom is born emptiness-wisdom"; "from emptiness-wisdom is born conventional wisdom"; and "from conventional wisdom is born middle wisdom." "Empty-born" is precisely being-wisdom: this is Perfect-Teaching emptiness-wisdom-born; and here, now, it is Perfect-Teaching emptiness-wisdom-born.**

### 20. Ānanda (阿難)

**「阿難」，此云歡喜，或無染，淨飯王冀太子為金輪霸其宗社，忽棄國捐王，憂惱殆絕，魔來誑之：「汝子已死。」王哭云：「阿夷語既虛，瑞相亦無驗。」**

**"Ānanda" (阿難 *Ānán*): Translated as "Joy" (*Huānxǐ*) or "No Defilement" (*Wúrǎn*). King Śuddhodana hoped the Crown Prince [Siddhārtha] would become a golden-wheel [cakravartin] and dominate the clan and state. Suddenly he abandoned the country and cast aside the king; the King's sorrow and distress nearly killed him. Mara came to deceive him: "Your son is dead." The King wept and said: "Ayi's words have already proven false, and the auspicious marks have also not come to verification."**

---

**復有天來云：「汝子成佛。」王疑未決，須臾信報：「昨夜天地大動，太子成佛。」王大歡喜，白飯王奏云：「生兒。」舉國欣欣，因名歡喜，是為父母作字。**

**Then a deva came and said: "Your son has become a Buddha." The King had not yet resolved his doubt. In a moment a trusted report arrived: "Last night heaven and earth shook greatly; the Crown Prince has become a Buddha." The King had great joy. King Śuklodana reported: "A son has been born." The whole country was delighted; because of this he was named "Joy." This is the name given by his parents.**

*[Critical apparatus: [9] 信【大】，使【甲】; [10] 大【大】，太【甲】; [11] 頸【大】，頸云云【甲】]*

---

**阿難端正，人見皆悅，佛使著覆肩衣。有一女人將兒詣井，見阿難目視不眴，不覺以綆繫其兒頸。**

**Ānanda was upright and correct; all who saw him were pleased. The Buddha made him wear a robe covering his shoulder [to hide his beauty]. A woman taking her child to the well saw Ānanda and stared unblinkingly; unknowingly she tied the rope around her child's neck [instead of the bucket].**

---

**《中阿含》云：「四眾若聞阿難所說，若多若少無不歡喜，欲發問時先為謦咳，大眾皆歡喜。四眾若觀其默，行住坐臥，指撝處分，進止動轉皆歡喜。」**

**The *Madhyama Āgama* says: "If the four assemblies hear what Ānanda says, whether much or little, there are none who do not rejoice. When they wish to ask questions, he first clears his throat, and the great assembly all rejoices. If the four assemblies observe his silence - his walking, standing, sitting, and lying down; his pointing and directing; his advancing and stopping, his movements and turns - all rejoice."**

---

**阿難四月八日佛成道日生，侍佛得二十五年，推此佛年五十五，阿難年二十五。**

**Ānanda was born on the eighth day of the fourth month, the day the Buddha attained the Way. He attended the Buddha for twenty-five years. From this one infers: the Buddha was fifty-five years old, and Ānanda twenty-five.**

---

**佛時求侍，五百請為如前說，眾勸阿難，阿難順從，五百皆歡喜。**

**At that time, the Buddha sought an attendant. Five hundred requested [the post], as explained earlier. The assembly urged Ānanda; Ānanda complied, and the five hundred all rejoiced.**

---

**目連騰阿難三願，佛言：「預知譏嫌，求不受故衣食，欲自利益求出入無時。」佛印而許。**

**Maudgalyāyana raised Ānanda's three requests. The Buddha said: "[He] anticipates slander and suspicion, so he requests not to accept old robes or food [set aside]; wishing to benefit himself, he requests unrestricted times for going out and coming in." The Buddha sealed [approved] it and granted it.**

---

**佛言：「阿難勝過去侍，過去侍聞說乃解，今佛未發言，阿難已解如來意，須是、不須是皆悉能知。」故以法付阿難，如來歡喜。**

**The Buddha said: "Ānanda surpasses the attendants of the past. Past attendants, after hearing the teaching, then understood. Now, before the Buddha has even spoken, Ānanda already understands the Tathāgata's intent; whether it is necessary or unnecessary, he is able to know it all." Therefore he entrusted the Dharma to Ānanda, and the Tathāgata rejoiced.**

---

**四天王各奉佛鉢，佛累而按之合成一鉢，四緣宛然而此鉢大重，阿難歡喜，荷持無倦。**

**The Four Heavenly Kings each offered the Buddha a bowl. The Buddha stacked them and pressed them together, combining them into a single bowl. The four rims remained distinct, yet the bowl was very heavy. Ānanda rejoiced and carried it without weariness.**

---

**《中阿含》第七云：「阿難侍佛二十五年，所聞八十千揵度皆誦不遺，不重問一句。」念力歡喜。**

**The seventh [fascicle] of the *Madhyama Āgama* says: "Ānanda attended the Buddha for twenty-five years. Of what he heard - eighty thousand *skandhakas* - he recited them all without omission, and did not need to ask again even a single sentence." This is joy in the power of mindfulness/recall.**

---

**阿難隨佛入天人龍宮，見天人龍女，心無染著，雖未盡殘思而能不染，一切天人龍神無不歡喜。**

**Ānanda followed the Buddha into the palaces of devas, humans, and dragons. Seeing deva-people and dragon-women, his mind had no defiled attachment. Although he had not yet exhausted residual thought, he was able to remain undefiled, and all devas, humans, dragons, and spirits rejoiced.**

---

**佛滅度後在師子床，迦葉大眾讚曰：「面如淨滿月，眼若青蓮華，佛法大海水，流入阿難心。」**

**After the Buddha entered extinction, upon the lion-seat, Kāśyapa and the great assembly praised him, saying: "His face is like the pure full moon; his eyes are like blue lotus flowers. The ocean-water of the Buddha-Dharma flows into Ānanda's mind."**

---

**自誓坐入涅槃，住恐離車有怨，進恐闍王有怨。**

**He vowed to sit and enter Nirvana. If he stayed, he feared the Licchavis would harbor resentment; if he went forward, he feared King Ajātaśatru would harbor resentment.**

---

**於恒河中，入風奮迅三昧，分身為四分：一與天，一與龍，一毘舍離，一阿闍世。**

**In the Ganges, he entered the Samādhi of Wind Swift-Vigor and divided his body into four parts: one for the devas, one for the dragons, one for Vaiśālī, and one for Ajātaśatru.**

---

**阿育王禮阿難塔，奉千萬兩金，偈歎白：「能攝持法身，法燈故法住，念盛佛智海，故設上供養，念持多所聞，口出微妙語，世尊所讚歎，天人之所愛。」**

**King Aśoka paid homage at Ānanda's stupa and offered ten million taels of gold. In verse he praised, saying: "Able to gather and uphold the Dharma-body; because of the Dharma-lamp, the Dharma abides. Mindfulness fills the ocean of the Buddha's wisdom; therefore I establish supreme offerings. Mindfulness holds much that was heard; from his mouth issue subtle and wondrous words. Praised by the World Honored One; beloved by devas and humans."**

---

**《增一》云：「知時明物，所至無疑，所憶不忘，多聞廣達，堪任奉持，阿難第一。」**

**The *Ekottara Āgama* says: "Knowing the time and understanding things; wherever he goes there is no doubt; what he remembers he does not forget; much-hearing and broadly penetrating; capable of bearing and upholding [the Dharma] - Ānanda is foremost."**

---

**約教者，歡喜阿難，三藏也；賢阿難，通也；典藏阿難，別也；海阿難，圓也。**

**According to the *Teachings*:**
*   **Tripiṭaka:** "Joyful Ānanda."
*   **Shared:** "Worthy Ānanda" (*Xián*).
*   **Distinct:** "Storehouse-Holder Ānanda."
*   **Perfect:** "Ocean Ānanda" (*Hǎi Ānán*).

---

**本迹者，本住非歡喜非不歡喜，法身如虛空，智慧如雲雨，能持能受。迹為歡喜也。**

**According to *Fundamental/Trace*: He abides in neither joy nor non-joy; the Dharma Body is like empty space, Wisdom like clouds and rain, able to hold and receive. His trace acts as Joy.**

---

**觀心與相似即空、即假、即中相應，是觀心歡喜，乃至真觀相應(云云)。**

**[As for] contemplating the mind: corresponding with the stage of resemblance as identical-to-emptiness, identical-to-provisional, and identical-to-middle is what is called "Contemplating-the-Mind Joy" - up to corresponding with true contemplation (and so on).**

---

### 21. Rāhula (羅睺羅)

**「羅睺羅」，此言覆障，往昔塞鼠穴，又不看婆羅門六日，由是緣故故言覆障。太子求出家，父王不許，殷勤不已，王言：「若汝有子，聽汝出家。」菩薩指指妃腹：「却後六年，汝當生男。」在胎六年，故言覆障。**

**"Rāhula" (羅睺羅 *Luóhóuluó*): This means "Covering Obstacle" (*Fùzhàng*). In the past he blocked a mouse hole, and also did not see a Brahmin for six days; because of these conditions he is called "Covering Obstacle." When the Crown Prince sought to leave home, the king-father would not permit it; the prince was earnest and would not stop. The king said: "If you have a son, I will allow you to leave home." The Bodhisattva pointed at his wife's belly: "After six years, you will bear a male child." He dwelt in the womb for six years; therefore he is called "Covering Obstacle."**

---

**真諦三藏云：「羅睺，本名修羅，能手障日月，翻此應言障月。」佛言：「我法如月，此兒障我不即出家，世世障我，我世世能捨，故言覆障。」**

**Paramārtha Tripiṭaka Master said: "Rāhu originally refers to [A]sura, who can obstruct the sun and moon with his hand; this should be translated as 'Obstructing the Moon'." The Buddha said: "My Dharma is like the moon; this child obstructed me from immediately leaving home. In lifetime after lifetime he obstructed me; in lifetime after lifetime I was able to renounce, so he is called Obstacle."**

*[Critical apparatus: [12] 翻此【大】，此翻【甲】; [13] 輪【大】，輪王【甲】; [1] 云【大】，睺【甲】; [2] 當【大】，當廣【甲】; [3] 法【大】，〔－〕【甲】]*

**佛出家後耶輸有娠，諸釋咸瞋，何因有此？欲治、欲殺，惡聲盈路，寶女劬毘羅證之小差。因焚火坑，發大誓願：「我若為非，子母俱滅，若真遺體，天當為證！」因抱子投坑，坑變為池，蓮華捧體，王及國人，始復不疑。**

**After the Buddha left home, Yaśodharā became pregnant. The Śākyas were all enraged: "By what cause could this be?" They wished to punish [her], even to kill [her]; vile rumors filled the roads. The jeweled maiden Gopikā gave testimony and there was some difference [in the situation]. Because of this, [Yaśodharā was made to face] a burning fire pit. She made a great vow: "If I have done wrong, then mother and child will both perish; if [this child is] truly a leftover body [from the Bodhisattva], heaven should bear witness!" She then held the child and threw herself into the pit. The pit transformed into a pond, and lotus flowers supported her body. Only then did the king and the people of the country cease to doubt.**

---

**後佛還國，耶輸令羅睺奉佛歡喜丸，羅云以幼稚之年，於大眾中徑持上佛，耶輸以此息謗。謗由有子，故言覆障。**

**Later, when the Buddha returned to the country, Yaśodharā had Rāhula offer the Buddha a "joy-pellet." Rāhula, though still a young child, in the midst of the great assembly directly carried it up to the Buddha. Yaśodharā used this to extinguish the slander. The slander arose because there was a child; therefore it is called "Covering Obstacle."**

---

**祖王歡喜：「雖失其父，而獲其子，孫為金輪，吾亦何恨？」想其長大，冀神寶至。**

**The ancestral king rejoiced: "Although I have lost his father, I have gained his son. When the grandson becomes a golden-wheel [king], what regret could I have?" He imagined him grown and hoped for the arrival of the divine treasures.**

---

**而佛索令出家，父王不許，耶輸將上高樓，目連飛空來取，佛度出家，付舍利弗為弟子。既出家已，王位亦失，故言覆障。**

**But the Buddha demanded that he leave home. The king-father would not permit it. Yaśodharā brought [Rāhula] up to a high tower; Maudgalyāyana flew through the air and came to take him. The Buddha ordained him, assigning him to Śāriputra as a disciple. Once he had left home, the royal succession was also lost; therefore it is called "Covering Obstacle."**

---

**羅睺以沙彌之年喜多妄語，國王、大臣、婆羅門、居士來求見佛，羅云答云：「不在。」令無量人不得見佛，是為障他。由是妄語，佛即訶責。**

**When Rāhula was a novice (*śrāmaṇera*), he delighted in telling many falsehoods. When kings, great ministers, brahmins, and householders came seeking to see the Buddha, Rāhula answered: "He is not here." Countless people were thereby unable to see the Buddha - this is called obstructing others. Because of this lying, the Buddha immediately rebuked him.**

---

**行還使羅云洗足，脚挑澡盆三覆三仰，然後覆地命令注水，羅睺云：「盆覆注水不立。」佛言：「汝如覆盆，於佛法中法水不立，今當實語，勿妄語也。」**

**[Because Rāhula lied frequently as a novice:] The Buddha told Rāhula to wash his feet. [After washing,] he tipped the basin over and up three times, then covered it on the ground and ordered water to be poured on it. Rāhula said: "The basin is covered; water will not stay." The Buddha said: "You are like the covered basin; in the Buddha Dharma, the Dharma-water does not stay. Now you must speak truth; do not lie."**

---

**後時修道殷勤不獲，以問佛，佛言：「汝為人說五陰未？」答言：「未。」「當為他說。」說竟又問，「汝說十二入未？說十八界未？說法是得道之門，若欲得道當為他說法。」因廣說法竟然後得道，是為覆障。**

**Later, he cultivated the path with diligence but did not obtain [realization], so he asked the Buddha. The Buddha said: "Have you explained the Five Aggregates to others yet?" He answered: "Not yet." [The Buddha said:] "You should explain them for others." After he finished explaining, he asked again: "Have you explained the Twelve Sense-Bases yet? Have you explained the Eighteen Elements yet? Explaining Dharma is the gate of attaining the path. If you wish to attain the path, you should explain Dharma for others." Therefore, after he had broadly explained Dharma and finished, only then did he attain the path - this is called "Covering Obstacle."**

---

**既已得道，見愛皆除，三界生盡，故言覆障。三界生盡，願不能牽，故言覆障。**

**After he attained the path, views and cravings were all eliminated and births in the three realms were exhausted; therefore it is called "Covering Obstacle." With births in the three realms exhausted, vows could no longer pull [him onward]; therefore it is called "Covering Obstacle."**

---

**佛勅四大羅漢不得滅度，待我法滅盡。由是住持于今，未得入無餘涅槃，故言覆障(云云)。**

**The Buddha commanded the four great Arhats not to enter extinction, but to await the complete extinction of my Dharma. Because of this, he remains preserving [the teaching] to the present and has not been able to enter Nirvana without remainder; therefore it is called "Covering Obstacle" (and so on).**

---

**約教者，析法道諦障四住，三藏意也；體法道諦障四住，通教也；次第三智障五住，別教也；一心三智障五住，圓教也。**

**According to the *Teachings*:**
*   **Tripiṭaka:** Analytical Path Truth obstructing the Four Abodes [of affliction].
*   **Shared:** Embodied Path Truth obstructing the Four Abodes.
*   **Distinct:** Sequential Three Wisdoms obstructing the Five Abodes.

## 7. CONCLUSION (結)

**六、結。「如是等眾所知識」，或言知秖是識，或言聞名為知、見形為識，見形為知、見心為識。**

**Sixth, "Conclusion": "Such assemblies are what the multitude knows as [good] friends." Some say "knowing" (*zhī*) is simply "recognition" (*shí*). Some say: hearing the name is "knowing" and seeing the form is "recognition"; seeing the form is "knowing" and seeing the mind is "recognition."**

**本者，本為眾生作滿字知識，迹為半字知識(云云)。**

**According to *Fundamental/Trace*: fundamentally [they] act for sentient beings as a "full-word" good friend; in trace [they] act as a "half-word" good friend (and so on).**

## 8. LEARNERS AND NO-LEARNERS (學無學二千)

**多知識眾竟，次列少知識眾者。「復有學無學二千人俱」，但舉位明數而不歎德，呼此為少知識眾耳。聖與凡絕交，亦不分別多識少識，特以希高慕遠者以多識引之，藏名隱德退讓者以少識引之，隨順眾生故有若干，不可以多少之迹失其本。**

**When the assembly of "many good friends" is complete, next they list the assembly of "few(er) good friends." As for "There were also two thousand Learners and No-Learners together": it merely cites the rank to clarify the number and does not praise their virtue; therefore it calls this the "few-good-friends" assembly. Sages and ordinary people are utterly disconnected; there is also no discrimination of many-good-friends versus few-good-friends. Rather, because those who hope for the lofty and admire the far are led by many-good-friends, while those whose names are hidden and whose virtue is concealed and who yield and withdraw are led by few-good-friends, in accordance with sentient beings there are thus various numbers. One must not, because of the trace of "more" or "less," lose its fundamental [meaning].**

---

**「學無學」者，三藏中十八種學人，九種無學人；通教五地皆名學，六地名無學，又通教九地名為學，佛地為無學；別圓中，或就功用、無功用，或就具足、未具足，明學無學。《阿含》云：「外道問佛：『羅漢更學不？』佛言：『羅漢不作惡法，住於善法，學其無學即名為學。』」若爾，學人亦稱無學。學人齊其所斷，不復更斷，即是無學，是為四句。就五方便，非學非無學，便是五句。約四教中例亦應爾，四五二十句。**

**As for "Learner/No-Learner": in the Tripiṭaka there are eighteen kinds of Learners and nine kinds of No-Learners. In the Shared Teaching, the Five Grounds are all called Learner and the Sixth Ground is called No-Learner; also, in the Shared Teaching the Ninth Ground is called Learner and the Buddha-ground is No-Learner. In the Distinct and Perfect [Teachings], one may clarify Learner/No-Learner either in terms of "with effort" and "without effort," or in terms of "complete" and "not yet complete."**
*[Critical apparatus: [6] 為【大】，名【甲】]*


**The Āgamas say: "A non-Buddhist asked the Buddha: 'Does an Arhat still learn?' The Buddha said: 'An Arhat does not make evil dharmas; he abides in good dharmas. Learning his no-more-learning is precisely called learning.'" If this is so, then learners are also called no-more-learners. When learners are equal to what they have cut off and do not cut off further, that is no-more-learning: this makes four statements. Taking the five "expedients," [one may also say] neither learner nor no-more-learner: that makes five statements. By analogy in the four teachings, it should likewise be so: four times five makes twenty statements.**

---

**本迹者，本法身大士，居滿字學無學位，眾生應以半字學無學人，莊嚴雙樹也。**

**According to *Fundamental/Trace*: fundamentally, they are Dharma-body great beings dwelling in the "full-word" learner/no-more-learning position; sentient beings respond by [appearing as] "half-word" learners/no-more-learners, adorning the Twin Sāla Trees.**

---

**觀者正觀中道，不緣二邊，中間即是無學，能如是觀是名為學。若就觀門明數者，觀色心具十法界、十如，界如互論即具二千，舉迹故標本法，迹即是本迹也。**

**As for contemplation: rightly contemplating the Middle Way, not conditioning on the two extremes, the "middle" is precisely no-more-learning; one who can contemplate in this way is called a learner. If one clarifies the number by the contemplation-gate: in contemplating form and mind as possessing the Ten Dharma Realms and the Ten Suchnesses, with realms and suchnesses mutually interfused, one thereby has two thousand. Raising the trace, it thus marks the fundamental Dharma; trace itself is precisely Fundamental/Trace.**

## 9. THE BHIKṢUNĪS (比丘尼)

**次列尼眾者，舊以此例前為二眾，今不用。若例前為多識、少識二眾者，又復無文，義亦不可。但是舉兩眾主，何須苦名為大小、多少耶？**

**Next they list the nuns. The old [interpretation] took this, by analogy with what precedes, as [making] two assemblies, but now we do not use that. If one were to analogize it to the prior "many-good-friends" and "few-good-friends" as two assemblies, again there is no textual basis, and the meaning is also untenable. It merely raises the leaders of the two assemblies; why must one labor to name them "greater/smaller" or "more/less"?**

---

### 22. Mahāprajāpatī (波闍波提)

**先列「波闍波提」，此翻大愛道，亦云憍曇彌，此翻眾主，尼者天竺女人通名也。**

**First is listed "Prajāpatī" (波闍波提): this is translated as "Great Path of Love." It is also called "Gautamī" (憍曇彌), translated as "Host of the Multitude." "Nun" (*ní*) is the general name for Indian women.**

---

**本住智度法門，迹為千佛之母，生育導師。**

**Fundamentally, [she] abides in the Dharma-gate of wisdom-transcendence; in trace, [she is] the mother of a thousand Buddhas, a teacher who gives birth and nurtures.**

*[Critical apparatus: [7] 迹【大】，〔－〕【甲】]*

---

**觀釋者，中觀廣博名大；無緣慈名愛；中理虛通名道。大即自行；愛即化他，如以愛故受生，慈故涉有；道即通自行、化他也。**

**Interpreted by contemplation: the Middle Contemplation is broad and expansive - thus it is called "great." Unconditioned compassion is called "love." The Middle principle is open and penetrating - thus it is called "path." "Great" is precisely self-practice; "love" is precisely transforming others - as, because of love, [one] receives birth, and because of compassion, [one] enters existence. "Path" precisely connects self-practice and transforming others.**

---

**「六千」者，數也。**

**"Six thousand": this is a number.**

---

**觀門者，觀六根清淨具千功德，雖眼有八百，耳千二百，以多足少，數滿六千，表本法門，亦是觀行意也。**

**In terms of a contemplation-gate: in contemplating the six sense faculties as pure and complete with a thousand merits - although the eye has eight hundred and the ear has twelve hundred - one uses the greater to fill out the lesser and the count reaches six thousand. This signifies the fundamental Dharma-gate and is also the intent of contemplation-and-practice.**

---

### 23. Yaśodharā (耶輸陀羅)

**「羅睺羅母耶輸陀羅」者，以子標母，此翻花色，亦曰名聞，或云無翻，溫良恭儉德齊太子，然在家為菩薩之妻、天人知識，出家為尼眾之主、位居無學，豈是無名聞眾耶？《十二遊經》出三夫人：第一、瞿夷，二、耶輸，三、鹿野。《未曾有》及《瑞應》皆云，羅睺是瞿夷子。《涅槃》及《法華》皆云，是耶輸子。二義云何通？或可彼經舉大母，此處舉所生。《釋論》瞿毘陀是寶女不孕。即是瞿夷，此翻明女，故知定是耶輸子也。**

**As for "Yaśodharā, mother of Rāhula": it uses the son to mark the mother. This is translated as "Flower-Color," and is also said to mean "Name-and-Fame"; some say it is left untranslated. She was gentle, good, respectful, and frugal; her virtue equaled the Crown Prince. While at home she was the Bodhisattva's wife and a good friend to devas and humans; after leaving home she was the leader of the nuns and held the rank of no-more-learning. How could she be among those without name and fame?**

**The *Twelve Wanderings Sutra* lists three consorts: first, Gopā (瞿夷); second, Yaśu (耶輸); third, Deer Park (鹿野). The *Unprecedented Events* and the *Auspicious Responses* both say that Rāhula is the son of Gopā. The *Nirvāṇa* and the *Lotus* both say he is the son of Yaśu. How are the two meanings to be reconciled? Perhaps those sutras cite the "greater mother," while here it cites the birth mother. The *Treatise* says that Gopikā (瞿毘陀) is a jeweled maiden who is barren. This is Gopā, translated as "Bright Maiden." Therefore we know for sure that he is Yaśu's son.**

---

**本迹者，妻則齊也，豈有博地為太子妻？故知本住寂定微妙法喜，迹為佛妻。《悲花》云：「寶藏佛所，誓願為妻耳。」**

**According to *Fundamental/Trace*: as wives, they are equal - how could one of vast ground [a great bodhisattva] be the Crown Prince's wife? Therefore we know that fundamentally she abides in quiescent samādhi and subtle Dharma-joy; in trace she is the Buddha's wife. The *Sūtra of the Sorrowful Flower* says: "In the presence of the Buddha Ratnagarbha (Treasure-Store), [she] vowed only to be a wife."**

*[Critical apparatus: [8] 寶【大】，昔寶【甲】]*

---

**觀空無漏法喜，即以鹿野表妻；觀假道種智法喜，即以耶輸表妻；觀中法喜，即以瞿夷表妻。**

**In contemplating emptiness and the outflow-free Dharma-joy, Deer Park represents the wife; in contemplating provisionality and the Dharma-joy of path-kind wisdom, Yaśu represents the wife; in contemplating the middle and Dharma-joy, Gopā represents the wife.**

**上當分明本迹、觀心，今更總論，顯善權曲巧，明觀行精微。夫首楞嚴種種示現，稱適根性靡所不為，今且近論，託迹王宮降神聖后，法身菩薩，皆輔佛行化，散影餘家，若三十二瑞，金姿誕應，諸大士各各出生，或空室雨寶，寄辯通夢，若皇皇太子，捨國捐王，踰城學道，諸大士悉從師請業，才藝兼通，為彼宗匠，若法輪初啟甘露門開，聞諸大士化緣未熟，示同不受，分庭抗禮，崇我道真，能化所化全生如乳；若所化緣熟，則素絲易染，池花早開，革凡成聖轉乳成酪；師宗為佛上首弟子，或智慧、神通、辯才、三昧各各第一，共輔法王更度未度，重熟已熟，於方等座席聞菩薩不可思議功德，耻小慕大，耻小則嗚呼自責，失於如來無量知見，慕大則不知當云何得佛無上慧，如轉酪為生蘇；次聞般若摩訶衍門，初歷色心終于種智，含挾小大，出內取與，或共或別或偏或圓，奉命領知而無希取，雖未頓捨已漸通泰，如轉生蘇為熟蘇；次聞《法華》會天性，定父子、授記莂、付大乘，廢三歸一，如餘四味，同一醍醐，不令一人獨得滅度，皆以如來滅度而滅度之。法王、法臣大事出世巧用方便，初用半字法，破二十五有之繁芿，成四枯雙樹利益眾生。次用半滿法，破二乘之獨善，成菩薩之廣大，成四榮雙樹利益聖人。後用常住滿字，破二邊之前後，成非枯非榮佛祕密藏，究竟利益。主將之功畢，大誓之願滿，故身子、目連於《法華》而息化，聖主贖命，斯亦不久，文云：「如我本誓願，今者已滿足，如來不久當入涅槃。」唱滅之言起自於此，二萬燈明迦葉佛等，皆於《法華》究竟，今以師弟皆於此經發迹，內祕菩薩道，外現作聲聞。「我實成佛已來無量億劫」，以此推之，諸大羅漢從法身地，俯影隨緣迹臨萬水，為學無學，作男作女，示道示俗，首楞嚴力靡所不現，方便善權為若此(云云)。**

**Above, we should have clearly distinguished the Fundamental/Trace and Contemplating-the-Mind. Now we further present a general discussion, manifesting the subtle ingenuity of good provisional expedients and clarifying the subtlety of contemplative practice.**
*[Critical apparatus: [9] 革【大】＊，隔【甲】＊; [1] 以【大】，之【甲】; [2] 佛【大】，道【甲】]*


**The Śūraṅgama [power] manifests in many ways, fitting capacities and leaving nothing it will not do. For the moment, we speak in closer terms: taking on trace in a royal palace and descending as a numinous response into a holy queen. Dharmakāya bodhisattvas all assist the Buddha in teaching and transforming, scattering their shadows into other households. Whether it is the thirty-two auspicious marks and the golden form responding to birth, with great beings each being born; or an empty chamber raining treasures; or eloquence lodged in and communicated through dreams; or the majestic Crown Prince abandoning country and king, crossing beyond the city to seek the Way - the great beings all follow the teacher and request instruction, their skills and arts comprehensively penetrating, serving as masters of that tradition.**

**When the Dharma wheel is first set in motion and the gate of sweet dew is opened: if they hear that the bodhisattvas' transforming conditions are not yet ripe, they manifest as similarly not accepting [the teaching], standing apart and offering resistance, exalting their own way as true. Transformer and transformed remain wholly in the stage of milk. If the conditions of those to be transformed are ripe, then plain silk is easily dyed and pond flowers bloom early: ordinary is transformed into saintly, and milk is turned into curds.**

**The masters and lineages become the Buddha's chief disciples. Some are foremost in wisdom, some in spiritual powers, some in eloquence, some in samādhi - each in their own way. Together they assist the Dharma King, again liberating those not yet liberated and further ripening those already ripened. At the Vaipulya seats, hearing the bodhisattvas' inconceivable merits, they feel ashamed of the small and yearn for the great. Ashamed, they cry out and reproach themselves for having missed the Tathāgata's immeasurable knowledge and vision. Yearning for the great, they do not know how they could obtain the Buddha's unsurpassed wisdom - like turning curds into fresh butter.**

**Next they hear the Mahāyāna gate of Prajñā: beginning by traversing form and mind, ending in seed-wisdom. They encompass and carry along small and great; go out and in, take and give; are sometimes shared, sometimes distinct, sometimes partial, sometimes perfect. They receive the Buddha's command and understand, without seeking acquisition. Though they have not abruptly renounced, they gradually become open and at ease - like turning fresh butter into cooked butter.**

**Next they hear the *Lotus*: it brings heavenly nature into one; determines father and son, bestows prophecies, entrusts the Mahāyāna, abolishes the three and returns to the one. Like the other four flavors, it becomes one ghee. It does not allow a single person to attain extinction alone; all take the Tathāgata's extinction as their extinction.**

**In the great matter of appearing in the world, the Dharma King and the Dharma ministers skillfully use expedients. First they use the half-word Dharma, breaking the luxuriant branches of the twenty-five existences and establishing the four withered twin trees, benefiting sentient beings. Next they use the half-and-full Dharma, breaking the two vehicles' solitary self-good and establishing the bodhisattvas' vastness - the four flourishing twin trees - benefiting sages. Afterwards they use the permanent, full-word Dharma, breaking the before-and-after of the two extremes and establishing the Buddha's secret store that is neither withered nor flourishing, bringing ultimate benefit.**

**When the merit of the general and commander is complete and the vow of the great oath is fulfilled, Śāriputra and Maudgalyāyana therefore cease their transformations in the *Lotus*. The holy lord redeems lives; this too is not long. The text says: "As my original vow, now it is fulfilled; the Tathāgata will not long remain and will enter Nirvana." The words of proclaiming extinction arise from this. Twenty-thousand Lamp-Brightness Buddhas, Kāśyapa Buddhas, and the like all come to completion in the *Lotus*. Now, since both teacher and disciples manifest their traces in this sutra, inwardly they keep secret the bodhisattva path and outwardly appear as śrāvakas. "Since I truly became Buddha, immeasurable hundreds of thousands of myriads of kalpas [have passed]." From this we infer that the great Arhats descend from the ground of the Dharmakāya, bowing their shadows and following conditions; their traces come down upon the waters in myriad ways. They are learners and non-learners; they appear as male and female; they manifest the path and manifest the mundane. With Śūraṅgama power there is nothing they do not manifest - skillful expedients and good provisional means are like this (and so on).**

**總明觀者，上師弟施化法身所為，若不作觀方便，於行人無益，如貧數寶、似盲執燭。然心數甚多，且約善數，如弟子者眾但舉十人耳。十善數者，謂：信、進、念、定、慧、喜、猗、捨、覺、戒，此十數輔心王，能改惡就善、革凡成聖，辦一切法門，但以十心為本，如十弟子，輔佛行化，共熟眾生，立于佛法也。信數對那律天眼第一，眼是五根首，如諸方以東為上，信於諸數初入佛法也。進數對迦葉頭陀第一，抖擻勤苦對進數也。念數對波離持律第一，念力牢強憶持不忘也。定數對目連神通第一，慧數對身子智慧第一，皆可解。喜數對阿難多聞第一，多聞分別樂，樂即喜數也。猗數對旃延，論體窮微盡理，除邪顯正，如猗離惡得善，放苦入樂也。捨數對善吉解空第一，若住空平等與捨數相應。覺數對富樓那說法第一，覺是語本，本立則辯說無窮。戒數對羅云持戒第一，可解。十數扶心王能成觀行，於一念中深入善法，三寶具足，王即佛寶；數即僧寶；所緣實際，無王無數，即法寶。若入實際王數之功，力用足矣。**

**To sum up contemplations: what the above teacher and disciples do - the workings of the dharmakāya that bestows transformation - if one does not make it into a contemplating expedient, it is of no benefit to the practitioner. It is like a poor man counting another's treasure; it is like a blind man holding a lamp.**
*[Critical apparatus: [＊9-1] 革【大】＊，隔【甲】＊]*


**The mind-factors are extremely many; for now, we take the wholesome set. Although the disciples are many, we only cite ten people. The ten wholesome factors are: faith, vigor, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom, joy, ease, equanimity, awakening, and restraint. These ten factors assist the mind-king: they can transform evil into good, transform the ordinary into sagehood, and accomplish all Dharma-gates. Taking only these ten minds as the basis - like the ten disciples assisting the Buddha in teaching and transforming, together ripening sentient beings and establishing them in the Buddha-Dharma.**

**The faith-factor corresponds to Aniruddha, foremost in the divine eye: the eye is the foremost among the five roots, just as among directions the east is taken as highest - faith is the first among the factors when first entering the Buddha-Dharma. The vigor-factor corresponds to Kāśyapa, foremost in ascetic practice: shaking off and diligent hardship corresponds to vigor. The mindfulness-factor corresponds to Upāli, foremost in upholding the vinaya: mindfulness-power is firm and strong, remembering and upholding without forgetting. The concentration-factor corresponds to Maudgalyāyana, foremost in spiritual powers. The wisdom-factor corresponds to Śāriputra, foremost in wisdom - these are all understood. The joy-factor corresponds to Ānanda, foremost in much-hearing: much-hearing discriminates joy; joy is precisely the joy-factor. The ease-factor corresponds to Kātyāyana: his analysis of the principle exhausts subtlety and reaches the ultimate meaning, removing the wrong and revealing the right - like ease leaving evil and obtaining good, releasing suffering and entering joy. Equanimity corresponds to Subhūti, foremost in understanding emptiness: if one abides in the equality of emptiness, it corresponds to equanimity. Awakening corresponds to Pūrṇa, foremost in preaching the Dharma: awakening is the root of speech; when the root is established, eloquence and expounding are inexhaustible. Restraint corresponds to Rāhula, foremost in holding precepts - this can be understood.**

**When the ten factors support the mind-king, they can accomplish contemplating practice. In a single thought one penetrates deeply into wholesome dharmas, and the Three Jewels are complete: the king is the Buddha Jewel; the factors are the Saṅgha Jewel; the object contemplated is the reality-limit - with neither king nor factors - which is the Dharma Jewel. If one enters the reality-limit, the merit of king and factors has power and function sufficient [for the work].**

---

**又取通大地十數與心王俱起，入善、入惡遍通一切，謂：想、欲、觸、慧、念、思、解脫、憶、定、受也。想對富樓那，想得假名，其人善達假名，辯才無滯。欲對迦葉，迦葉無世間欲而欲於無為。觸對旃延，觸入二事更相涉入，旃延善論義，能窮往復。慧即身子，可解。念對波離，念持律之上也。思對羅云，思是行陰，此人實行持戒也。解脫對善吉，脫名無累，此人解空於有得脫。憶對那律，憶動發取境修天眼，易三摩提。定數對目連，可解。受對阿難，多聞領持無謬也。十人各備眾德，為引專門，宣示佛道，隨眾生欲。欲慧者師身子，乃至欲多聞者師阿難，共輔法王，各掌一職。**

**Further, take the ten universal factors of the great earth that arise together with the mind-king, entering good and entering evil and pervading all: conceptualization, desire, contact, wisdom, mindfulness, intention, liberation, recollection, concentration, and feeling.**
*[Critical apparatus: [3] 旃【大】＊，栴【甲】＊; [＊3-1] 旃【大】＊，栴【甲】＊]*


**Conceptualization corresponds to Pūrṇa: conceptualization obtains provisional names; this person is good at understanding provisional names, and his eloquence has no obstruction. Desire corresponds to Kāśyapa: Kāśyapa has no worldly desire, yet desires the unconditioned. Contact corresponds to Kātyāyana: contact enters into two matters and they mutually interpenetrate; Kātyāyana is skilled in debating meaning and can exhaust the back-and-forth. Wisdom is Śāriputra - this can be understood. Mindfulness corresponds to Upāli: mindfulness is supreme in upholding the vinaya. Intention corresponds to Rāhula: intention is the formation aggregate; this person truly practices and holds precepts. Liberation corresponds to Subhūti: liberation means without entanglement; this person understands emptiness and thereby gains liberation amid existence. Recollection corresponds to Aniruddha: recollection is stirred, arousing the taking of objects to cultivate the divine eye, and facilitating samādhi. Concentration corresponds to Maudgalyāyana - this can be understood. Feeling corresponds to Ānanda: much-hearing receives and upholds without error.**

**The ten people each fully possess the assembly of virtues, serving as lead-teachers for specialized approaches, proclaiming and revealing the Buddha-way according to sentient beings' desires. Those who desire wisdom take Śāriputra as their teacher; up to those who desire much-hearing taking Ānanda as their teacher. Together they assist the Dharma King, each taking charge of one office.**

---

**今觀心亦如是，一一心中皆具王數，為成觀故，王數相扶而取開悟，或於想數入道，或於欲數入道，隨所宜者，心王、心數而共攻之，化取塵勞諸心而作佛事。作此觀未悟，觀行如乳；若發無漏，觀行如酪；若破塵沙，如生熟蘇；若破無明，觀如醍醐。至醍醐時王數皆畢，心心法數不行故，名行般若波羅蜜。《普賢觀》云：「觀心無心，法不住法，我心自空，罪福無主。」即是無心、無數名為正觀。是心數塵勞若不盡者，觀則不訖，故經言：「眾生不度，我不成正覺。」即此意也(云云)。**

**Now contemplating the mind is also like this: within each and every mind, the king and the factors are all present. In order to accomplish contemplation, king and factors mutually support one another and thereby obtain awakening. One may enter the path through the conceptualization-factor, or enter the path through the desire-factor - according to what is appropriate. Mind-king and mind-factors together apply themselves, transforming and taking the dusty-labors of the various minds and making them into Buddha-work.**
*[Critical apparatus: [4] 法數【大】，數法【甲】]*


**If one performs this contemplation and has not yet awakened, contemplative practice is like milk. If one gives rise to the outflow-free, contemplative practice is like curds. If one breaks through dust-and-sand, it is like fresh and cooked butter. If one breaks through ignorance, contemplation is like ghee. When it reaches ghee, the king and the factors are all complete; because in each and every mind the Dharma-factors do not operate, it is called practicing prajñā-pāramitā.**

**The *Samantabhadra Contemplation* says: "Contemplate mind as no-mind; dharmas do not abide in dharmas; my mind is itself empty; sin and blessing have no master." This is precisely what is called correct contemplation: no mind and no factors.**

**If the dusty-labors of mind-factors are not yet exhausted, contemplation is not yet finished. Therefore the sutra says: "If sentient beings are not liberated, I will not attain unsurpassed awakening." This is precisely the meaning here (and so on).**

## 10. THE BODHISATTVA ASSEMBLY (菩薩眾)

### Structural Map (CBETA 002:232–363)
1. 氣類 (Type)
2. 大數 (Great number)
3. 階位 (Rank/position)
4. 歎德 (Praising virtues)
5. 列名 (Listing names)
6. 結句 (Concluding phrase)

---

**第二列菩薩眾者，《釋論》云：「菩薩為出家、在家四眾攝，何故別列？答：『有菩薩墮四眾中，有四眾不墮菩薩中，為其不發心作佛，故今別列。』」同發心求作佛者名菩薩眾。文為六：一、氣類；二、大數；三、階位；四、歎德；五、列名；六、結句。**

**Second is listed the Bodhisattva assembly. The *Treatise* says: "Bodhisattvas are included within the four assemblies of those who have left home and those who remain at home; why then are they listed separately? Answer: 'Some bodhisattvas fall within the four assemblies, but some members of the four assemblies do not fall within the bodhisattvas, because they have not aroused the aspiration to become Buddhas. Therefore, they are now listed separately.'" Those who equally arouse the mind and seek to become Buddhas are called the Bodhisattva assembly. The text has six parts: (1) type; (2) great number; (3) rank; (4) praising virtues; (5) listing names; (6) concluding phrase.**

*[Critical apparatus: [5] 眾【大】，〔－〕【甲】; [6] 名【大】，名為【甲】]*

---

**一、氣類者，即是菩薩摩訶薩也。若具存，應言菩提薩埵摩訶薩埵，什師嫌煩，略提埵二字。菩提，此言道；薩埵，此言心；摩訶，此言大。此諸人等皆求廣博大道，又成熟眾生故，道心、大道心之氣類也。菩薩多種，謂偏通別圓，如《釋論》引迦旃延子明六度齊限而滿者，此欲調血眾生為乳也；若《大品》明有菩薩發心與薩婆若相應者，此欲調乳入酪也；若《大品》明有菩薩發心遊戲神通淨佛國土，又如《淨名》中得不思議解脫者，皆能變身登座而復受屈被訶者，此欲調酪為生熟蘇也；若《大品》明有菩薩發心即坐道樹成正覺、轉法輪度眾生者，此是調蘇為醍醐也。故下文云：「菩薩聞是法，疑網皆已除。」又云：「若菩薩不聞《法華》，非善行菩薩道，若聞此經即善行菩薩道。」又《涅槃》云：「菩薩不聞《涅槃》，常有希望；若聞《涅槃》，希望都息。」故略有四種也。**

**1. Type: This is precisely the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas. If preserved in full, it should be "bodhi-sattva-mahā-sattva"; Master Kumārajīva considered it verbose and abbreviated it, only mentioning the two characters *sattva* (*duò*). "Bodhi" means the Path; "sattva" means mind; "mahā" means great. These people all seek the broad, vast Great Path, and also mature sentient beings; thus they are the type of those with the "path-mind" and the "great-path-mind."**
*[Critical apparatus: [＊3-2] 旃【大】＊，栴【甲】＊; [1] 蘇【大】，熟蘇【甲】]*


**Bodhisattvas are of many kinds - partial, shared, distinct, and perfect. For example: the *Treatise* cites Kātyāyanīputra explaining the pāramitās as having fixed limits and becoming complete - this is the wish to transform blood-sentient-beings into milk. The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā* states that there are bodhisattvas who arouse the aspiration in correspondence with omniscience (*sarvajñatā*) - this is the wish to transform milk into curds. The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā* also states that there are bodhisattvas who arouse the aspiration, sport in supernormal powers, and purify Buddha-lands; and as in the *Vimalakīrti*, those who attain the inconceivable liberation can all transform their bodies, ascend the seat, and yet again accept humiliation and rebuke - this is the wish to transform curds into fresh and cooked butter. If the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā* states that there are bodhisattvas who, upon arousing the aspiration, immediately sit at the bodhi-tree, realize unsurpassed awakening, turn the Dharma wheel, and liberate sentient beings - this is transforming butter into ghee.**

**Therefore the text below says: "When bodhisattvas hear this Dharma, their nets of doubt are all removed." It also says: "If bodhisattvas do not hear the *Lotus*, they do not skillfully practice the bodhisattva path; if they hear this sutra, they do skillfully practice the bodhisattva path." And the *Nirvāṇa* says: "If bodhisattvas do not hear the *Nirvāṇa*, they always have hope; if they hear the *Nirvāṇa*, hope entirely ceases." Therefore, there are broadly four kinds.**

**本迹者，本地難測，或居等覺，或齊法王，如善財入法界見文殊色像無邊，法門深遠，本隣諸佛，迹輔釋迦為菩薩，普現色身三昧力，散影垂容，以口輪不可思議化隨宜廣說，可以意知，不可以言辯也。所以迹引四味，歸乎一實，譬如鎚碪器諸淳璞，成醍醐已，一期化息，然其本地究竟成就，豈是今日始入大乘？亦非寂滅道場高山先照，若頓、若漸皆迹所為耳。**

**According to *Fundamental and Trace*: the fundamental ground is hard to fathom - some dwell at the level of equal awakening; some are equal to the Dharma King. For example, when Sudhana enters the Dharma-realm and sees that Manjuśrī's form and images are boundless and his Dharma-gates deep and far, [this shows they] are fundamentally adjacent to the Buddhas. In trace, they assist Śākyamuni as bodhisattvas. By the power of the samādhi of universally manifesting form-bodies, they scatter their traces and let their appearances descend. By the inconceivable transformations of the "wheel of speech," they speak broadly as is appropriate. This can be known by meaning, but cannot be fully debated by words.**
*[Critical apparatus: [2] 迦【大】，尊【甲】; [3] 鎚【大】，槌【甲】]*


**Thus, in trace they cite the four flavors and return them to the One Real. It is like hammering and anvil-working raw ore into implements: once ghee is produced, the single period of teaching is brought to rest. Yet their fundamental ground is ultimately accomplished - how could it be that only today they first enter the Great Vehicle? And it is not that the quiescent-destruction bodhimaṇḍa is like a high mountain shining first; whether sudden or gradual, it is all trace-activity.**

**觀解者，中道觀心雙照二諦名大，通至菩提果名道，破五住塵勞名成眾生(云云)。**

**In terms of contemplation and understanding: contemplating the mind in the Middle Way and simultaneously illuminating the Two Truths is called "great"; reaching through to the fruit of bodhi is called "path"; breaking the dusty labors of the Five Abodes is called "accomplishing sentient beings" (and so on).**

**「八萬人」者，數也。餘經集眾甚多，此經何少？或是語其大數，或譬王論密事，不可率土同謀(云云)。**

**"Eighty thousand": this is a number. Other sutras gather assemblies in very large numbers - why is this sutra's [number] comparatively small? Perhaps it is speaking of the assembly's greatness by number; or it is like a king discussing secret matters, which cannot be planned together with the entire land (and so on).**

**約觀心者，觀一善心具十法界，十界交互，具百法界，千性相等，十善即萬法，約八正道即八萬法門也(云云)。**

**In terms of contemplating the mind: contemplate that one wholesome mind contains the Ten Dharma Realms; with ten realms mutually interfused, one has one hundred dharma-realms; with one thousand suchnesses of nature and characteristics, the ten wholesome [dharmas] are precisely the ten thousand dharmas. In terms of the Noble Eightfold Path, this is precisely eighty thousand Dharma-gates (and so on).**

**「皆於阿耨三菩提不退轉」者，明位也。阿耨，此云無上，道如境妙中說，位如位妙中說。不退轉者，約位、行、念論不退，應四種分別：不生三惡道，位不退；不生邊地，諸根完具不受女身，即行不退；常識宿命，即念不退，具此名阿鞞跋致地。三藏義也。若六心已前，輕毛菩薩信根未立，其位猶退；七心已上從初地至六地，不退為凡夫二乘，名位不退；雖正使已盡，而未能遍修萬行，其行猶退；至七地名行不退，而猶起二乘念，故有念退；至八地道觀雙流入法流水，名念不退，此名阿鞞跋致地，此乃三乘共十地之義耳。地師云：「十住是證不退，十行是位不退，十迴向是行不退，十地是念不退。」此是別教義，不會此經，今所不用。《瓔珞》云：「初地三觀現前，心心寂滅自然流入。」此亦別教不退，今亦不用。若《華嚴》明初住得如來一身、無量身，具三不退，此圓教不退，此是一實事，今用此判位也。**

**As for "All are irreversible from unsurpassed awakening": this clarifies rank/position. "Anuttara" means "unsurpassed." The "path" is as explained in the Wondrous of Objects; the "rank" is as explained in the Wondrous of Position.**
*[Critical apparatus: [6] 三【大】，此三【甲】]*


**"Irreversible" may be discussed in terms of position, practice, and thought. It should be analyzed in four ways: not being reborn in the three evil destinies is non-retrogression in position; not being reborn in borderlands, having the faculties complete, and not receiving a female body is non-retrogression in practice; constantly knowing past lives is non-retrogression in thought. Possessing these is called the Abhivartika ground - this is the Tripiṭaka meaning.**

**If it is before the sixth mind, the "light-as-feathers" bodhisattva has not yet established the faculty of faith and his position still retrogresses. From the seventh mind and above, from the First Ground through the Sixth Ground, he does not retrogress into ordinary persons or the two vehicles - this is called non-retrogression in position. Although the afflictions of right usage are already exhausted, he is not yet able to universally cultivate the ten thousand practices, so his practice still retrogresses. At the Seventh Ground it is called non-retrogression in practice, yet he still gives rise to thoughts of the two vehicles, so there is retrogression in thought. At the Eighth Ground, the path and contemplation flow together and enter the stream of Dharma - this is called non-retrogression in thought. This is called the Abhivartika ground - but this is only the meaning of the ten grounds shared by the three vehicles.**

**Some ground-masters say: "The Ten Abodes are non-retrogression in verification; the Ten Practices are non-retrogression in position; the Ten Dedications are non-retrogression in practice; the Ten Grounds are non-retrogression in thought." This is the Distinct Teaching meaning and does not accord with this sutra; we do not use it here. The *Yingluo* says: "At the First Ground, the Three Contemplations are present; in each mind there is quiescent destruction and it naturally flows in." This too is Distinct-Teaching non-retrogression and we also do not use it here. If the *Avataṃsaka* clarifies that at the First Abode one attains the Tathāgata's one body and immeasurable bodies and possesses the three non-retrogressions, this is Perfect-Teaching non-retrogression. This is the One Real Matter - we use this to judge the rank here.**

**本迹者，本地寂滅尚非十地，況是初住？尚非初住不退，況復別、通？別、通之位宜釋餘經列眾，圓教之位正在今經，諸經論師既不識迹安能知本？所歎既謬，毀在其中，還成增減兩謗，何謂歎德？觀心者，三觀即三不退，又一心三觀，即一心三不退(云云)。舊云：「皆得陀羅尼」去，始是歎德。今取不退轉即具兩意，成上屬明位，起後屬歎德。舊云：「歎德作十二句，分為四意：初三句歎現德，次三句歎往行，次四句歎內體，後兩句歎外名，四意不同而德居於初，故稱歎德。歎現又兩：初一句歎自行，後二句歎化他。歎行為三：初句歎行本，本從諸佛得般若；次句歎本行，行福德也，既有福德能資於慧；次句為佛所歎。體又三：初慈悲歎應身，中間兩句歎心慧報身，後一句歎法身。歎名為二：初句歎名普聞，次句歎能度眾生。」此之分文極有眉眼，覈論宗體，殊無趣向。若歎通教，通教無三身，又非入佛慧，名不普聞，種種義不成。若歎別教，別教初地已過二乘，云何七地更起聲聞、支佛之念？若歎圓教，不應言七地已下無不退之德，進退無當，竟知歎誰？是所不用。**

**According to *Fundamental/Trace*: the quiescent-destruction of the fundamental ground is still not the Ten Grounds - how much less is it the First Abode? If it is still not even the First Abode's non-retrogression, how much less can it be the Distinct or Shared? The Distinct and Shared ranks are appropriate for explaining other sutras' assembly lists. The Perfect Teaching rank is precisely in this sutra. Since the treatise-masters of other sutras do not recognize the trace, how can they know the fundamental? When what is praised is already mistaken, condemnation is contained within it; it turns into the two slanders of increasing and decreasing - how could this be called praising virtue?**
*[Critical apparatus: [7] 歎【大】，歎往【甲】; [8] 歎【大】，〔－〕【甲】]*


**As for contemplating the mind: the Three Contemplations are precisely the three non-retrogressions; and the one-mind three contemplations are precisely the one-mind three non-retrogressions (and so on).**

**The old [interpretation] said: only after the words "all attain dhāraṇī" does it begin praising virtues. Now we take "non-retrogression" as already containing two intentions: it completes the prior part as clarifying rank, and it initiates the later part as praising virtues.**

**The old [interpretation] said: "The praise of virtue forms twelve clauses, divided into four intentions: the first three clauses praise present virtues; the next three praise past practices; the next four praise the inner substance; the last two praise the outer name. The four intentions are different, yet 'virtue' is placed in the first, therefore it is called 'praising virtues.' The praise of the present has two [parts]: the first clause praises self-practice; the latter two praise transforming others. The praise of practice has three [parts]: the first clause praises the practice's root (obtaining prajñā from the Buddhas); the next clause praises the root-practice (merit that can support wisdom); the next clause is being praised by the Buddha. The substance also has three [parts]: first, compassion and pity praise the response-body; the middle two clauses praise mind-and-wisdom as the reward-body; the last clause praises the Dharma-body. The praise of name has two [parts]: first, the name being universally heard; second, the ability to ferry sentient beings."**

**This division of the text has a certain sharpness; but when one examines the doctrinal core, it has no direction. If it praises the Shared Teaching, the Shared Teaching has no three bodies, it is not entering Buddha-wisdom, and the name is not universally heard - various meanings cannot be made to work. If it praises the Distinct Teaching, at the First Ground the Distinct Teaching has already surpassed the two vehicles; how could the Seventh Ground again give rise to thoughts of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas? If it praises the Perfect Teaching, it should not say that below the Seventh Ground there is no virtue of non-retrogression; advance and retreat are ungrounded - who then is being praised? Therefore, this is not used.**

**今以十三句作橫竪消文，一、竪，約十地義便；二、橫，約初住義便。「不退轉」者成前，即是明位，起後即是歎德，以對初地。初地名歡喜，喜其不退墮二邊，入中道獲三不退，故知歎初歡喜地也。「皆得陀羅尼」歎二地，二地名離垢，亦名離達，離遮諸惡、達持眾善，即陀羅尼義，故知歎離垢地也。「樂說辯才」歎三地，三地名明地，內智明、外說辯，欲知智在說，說有種種樂，說最勝故，故知歎第三明地也。「轉不退轉法輪」歎四地，四地名焰，焰能破闇，又能焦炷，轉法輪自害己惑如焦炷，破他迷如除闇，故知歎第四焰地也。「供養百千諸佛」歎五地，五地名難勝地，此地得深禪定，用神通力難勝難及，於一念頃遍至十方供養諸佛，故知歎第五地也。「於諸佛所植眾德本」歎六地，六地名現前，由得禪能供養諸佛，福資種智，種智現前，智是德本，如植種於地，故知歎第六地也。「常為諸佛之所稱歎」歎第七遠行地，此地二智方便出過一切，廣修利益稱會佛心，故知歎第七地。「以慈修身」歎第八不動地，正智不動不出三界，但以慈董身應入五道，董口為說法，董心為設方便，正法華具董三業，故知歎第八地也。「善入佛慧」歎第九地，九地名善慧，深入實際妙徹本源，此名義最合，故知歎第九地。「通達大智」歎第十地，十地名法雲，法身如虛空，禪定如大雲，智慧如大雨，善入佛法名慧，巧用佛法名智，互舉耳。「到於彼岸」歎十地內德，到三諦之彼岸因中說果，又到在不久也。「名稱普聞」歎十地外德，由內德深廣，致令聲名普聞，內外相稱。若開等覺位者，此二句擬之。「能度百千眾生」者，餘地度人，或一界至九界，不名能度，十地勝前故稱能度。諸地悉具眾功德，而今出沒釋者，為人情好異故，依十地名便故，又豎義易解故，作此一途消文耳。**

**Now, using thirteen clauses, [Zhiyi] dissolves the text by "vertical" and "horizontal" [interpretations]: (1) the vertical - in terms of the Ten Grounds - is convenient; (2) the horizontal - in terms of the First Abode - is convenient.**
*[Critical apparatus: [9] 禪【大】，禪故【甲】; [10] 董【大】＊，薰【甲】＊; [＊10-1] 董【大】＊，薰【甲】＊; [11] 為【大】，為諸【甲】; [＊10-2] 董【大】＊，薰【甲】＊; [＊10-3] 董【大】＊，薰【甲】＊; [12] 地【大】，地也【甲】; [1] 或【大】，〔－〕【甲】]*


**"Non-retrogression" completes what precedes as clarifying rank and initiates what follows as praising virtues, corresponding to the First Ground. The First Ground is named Joy: joy that one does not retrogress and fall into the two extremes, but enters the Middle Way and obtains the three non-retrogressions - therefore we know it praises the First Joy Ground. "All attain dhāraṇī" praises the Second Ground: the Second Ground is named Purity-from-Defilement, also called Purity-from-Obstruction; "removing" blocks all evils and "maintaining" upholds all goods - this is precisely the meaning of dhāraṇī - therefore we know it praises the Second Purity-from-Defilement Ground.**

**"Delight in expounding eloquence" praises the Third Ground: the Third Ground is named Radiance; inner wisdom is bright and outer speech is eloquent. If one wishes to know wisdom, it is in speech; speech has various delights; speech is most excellent - therefore we know it praises the Third Radiance Ground. "Turning the non-retrogressive Dharma wheel" praises the Fourth Ground: the Fourth Ground is named Flame; flame can break darkness and can also scorch fuel. Turning the Dharma wheel harms one's own delusions like scorching fuel, and breaks others' confusion like removing darkness - therefore we know it praises the Fourth Flame Ground.**

**"Making offerings to hundreds and thousands of Buddhas" praises the Fifth Ground: the Fifth Ground is named Hard-to-Conquer; this ground obtains deep dhyāna, and by supernormal power it is hard to conquer and hard to reach; in a single thought it pervades the ten directions and makes offerings to Buddhas - therefore we know it praises the Fifth Hard-to-Conquer Ground. "Planting roots of virtues at the Buddhas" praises the Sixth Ground: the Sixth Ground is named Manifest; by obtaining dhyāna one can make offerings to Buddhas, merit supports seed-wisdom, and seed-wisdom becomes manifest; wisdom is the root of virtue, like planting seed in the ground - therefore we know it praises the Sixth Manifest Ground.**

**"Constantly praised by the Buddhas" praises the Seventh Far-Going Ground: on this ground, the two wisdoms and expedient means surpass everything, broadly cultivate benefit and accord with the Buddha's mind - therefore we know it praises the Seventh Far-Going Ground. "Cultivating the body with compassion" praises the Eighth Unmoving Ground: correct wisdom does not move and does not depart from the three realms, yet by compassion it guides the body to enter the five destinies, guides the mouth to preach the Dharma, and guides the mind to set up expedient means - therefore we know it praises the Eighth Ground.**

**"Well entering Buddha-wisdom" praises the Ninth Ground: the Ninth Ground is named Good Wisdom; it deeply enters the reality-limit and subtly penetrates the source - this name and meaning fit best - therefore we know it praises the Ninth Good-Wisdom Ground. "Penetrating great wisdom" praises the Tenth Ground: the Tenth Ground is named Dharma Cloud; the Dharma-body is like empty space, dhyāna is like a great cloud, and wisdom is like great rain. Skillfully entering Buddha-dharmas is called wisdom; skillfully using Buddha-dharmas is called knowledge - they are mutually raised.**

**"Arriving at the other shore" praises the inner virtue of the Ten Grounds: arriving at the other shore of the Three Truths - speaking of fruit within cause - and also, arriving is 'not far off.' "Name universally heard" praises the outer virtue of the Ten Grounds: because the inner virtue is deep and broad, the name becomes universally heard; inner and outer correspond. If one opens the Equal Awakening rank, these two clauses may be matched to it.**

**As for "able to ferry hundreds and thousands of sentient beings": other grounds ferry people in one realm up to nine realms, and are not called "able to ferry." The Tenth Ground surpasses the former, therefore it is called able. All grounds possess myriad virtues, yet now, by extracting and emerging [certain virtues], it is because human feelings favor difference; it follows the convenience of the Ten Grounds' names; and because the vertical meaning is easy to explain - therefore it dissolves the text by this single approach.**

---

**次，橫歎者，直約初住說之，餘位位例可解。初發心住，一發一切發，出過二邊革凡超聖入中道，其心寂滅，念念流入薩婆若海故，言得不退轉。初住遮離取相無知無明等障，持達般若解脫法身等德，故言得陀羅尼。十信似解，尚能以妙音遍滿三千界，何況初住？真解口密功德，故言樂說辯才。初住能分身百世界作佛，論其實處無量無邊，以能作佛，說法教化，故言能轉不退法輪。初住得不思議神力，遍能承事法界諸佛，故言供養百千諸佛。初住得實相本，能植眾德也。初住開佛知見，知見已法與諸佛同，故為佛之所稱歎。初住無緣慈普現色身，遍應法界，故言以慈修身。初住入祕密藏，故言善入佛慧。初住一心三智無能障礙，故云通達大智。初住事理分究竟，故言到於彼岸。初住圓德真實與名相稱，故言名稱普聞諸佛世界。初住能為十法界而作依止，安立救護，故言能度百千眾生。初住更有無量無邊不可思議種種功德，略言十三句耳。二住去乃至等覺亦復如是，故《大品》云：「初阿字門，具四十一字功德，後茶亦具諸字功德，中間亦爾，字等、語等、功德亦等。」**

**Next, in terms of the "horizontal" praise: it directly explains it in terms of the First Abode; by analogy, the other ranks can be understood. In the First Abode of initial arousing of the mind, one arouses once and everything is aroused; one goes beyond the two extremes, transforms the ordinary and surpasses the sage, entering the Middle Way. The mind is quiescent, and thought after thought flows into the sea of omniscience; therefore it is said to attain non-retrogression.**
*[Critical apparatus: [＊9-2] 革【大】＊，隔【甲】＊; [2] 供【大】，能供【甲】; [3] 能【大】，有【甲】]*


**The First Abode blocks and removes the obstructions of grasping at characteristics, ignorance of knowing, ignorance, and so on; and maintains and reaches the virtues of prajñā, liberation, the Dharma-body, and so on; therefore it is said to attain dhāraṇī. The Ten Faiths are only a semblance of understanding, yet they can already fill the three-thousand-world with wondrous sound - how much more the First Abode? Truly understanding the merits of the mouth-secret, therefore it is said to delight in expounding eloquence.**

**The First Abode can manifest bodies in a hundred worlds and act as Buddha; in truth it is immeasurable and boundless. Because it can act as Buddha and teach and transform, therefore it is said to be able to turn the non-retrogressive Dharma wheel. The First Abode attains inconceivable supernormal power and can everywhere serve the Buddhas of the Dharma-realm; therefore it is said to make offerings to hundreds and thousands of Buddhas. The First Abode attains the root of reality-mark and can plant all virtues.**

**The First Abode opens the Buddha's knowledge and vision; once knowledge and vision are opened, the dharmas are the same as the Buddhas'; therefore it is praised by the Buddhas. The First Abode, with unconditioned compassion, universally manifests form-bodies and pervades the Dharma-realm in response; therefore it is said to cultivate the body with compassion. The First Abode enters the secret store; therefore it is said to well enter Buddha-wisdom. The First Abode's one-mind three wisdoms have nothing that can obstruct them; therefore it is said to penetrate great wisdom. The First Abode exhausts the analysis of phenomena and principle; therefore it is said to arrive at the other shore. The First Abode's perfect virtue is real and corresponds to name and characteristic; therefore it is said the name is universally heard in the Buddhas' worlds.**

**The First Abode can become a support for the Ten Dharma Realms, establishing and protecting; therefore it is said to be able to ferry hundreds and thousands of sentient beings. The First Abode still has immeasurable and boundless inconceivable myriad virtues; thirteen clauses are spoken only briefly. From the Second Abode through Equal Awakening it is likewise. Therefore the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā* says: "In the initial 'A' gate, the merits of the forty-one letters are complete; the later 'CHA' likewise has the merits of all letters; the middle is also so - the letters are equal, the phrases are equal, and the merits are also equal."**

**問：此中歎斷惑德，三藏不斷惑，可不被歎；聲聞尚被歎，迹為通、別，何不歎德？**

**Question: Here, the praised virtues are virtues of cutting off delusions. Since the Tripiṭaka does not cut off delusions, it is acceptable that it not be praised; yet śrāvakas are still praised. If [this passage] in trace corresponds to the Shared and Distinct [Teachings], why are their virtues not praised?**

---

**答：通歎於迹乃有此義，今經正明圓人，不歎方便耳。**

**Answer: To universally praise trace, there would indeed be this meaning. But this sutra correctly clarifies Perfect persons; it simply does not praise expedients.**

---

**問：云何諸句功德皆歎初住耶？**

**Question: Why do all the clauses of virtues praise the First Abode?**

---

**答曰：餘位亦如是，何獨初住。舊云「八地有諸功德」，不以為疑；今圓歎初住，何德不攝？初住尚爾，何況後位耶？《法華論》云：「上支、下支門，總相、別相應知。」初得不退轉一句是總。此不退有十種示現：聞法不退轉，即是陀羅尼；樂說不退轉，即是樂說辯才；說不退轉，即是轉不退法輪；依善知識不退轉，即是供養百千諸佛植眾德本；斷疑不退轉，即是為諸佛稱歎；入事不退轉，即是以慈修身；入一切智如實境不退轉，即是善入佛慧；依我空法空不退轉，即是通達大智；入如實境不退轉，即是到於彼岸；應作所作不退轉，即是度百千眾生。故初總句即是上支，次諸別句即是下支。記中橫歎初住德，即與此意同也。論云：「二者攝取事門者，示現諸菩薩住何等清淨地中，因何等方便、何等境界、何等應作所作故。」若從此義，作豎歎菩薩德亦無妨。**

**Answer: The other ranks are also like this - why only the First Abode? The old [interpretation] said that the Eighth Ground has various virtues, and did not take it as doubtful. Now, when the Perfect Teaching praises the First Abode, what virtue would it not encompass? If even the First Abode is like this, how much more the later ranks?**
*[Critical apparatus: [4] 位【大】，住【甲】; [5] 空【大】，〔－〕【甲】]*


**The *Lotus Treatise* says: "The upper-branch and lower-branch gates - the general and particular aspects should be known." The initial clause "attaining non-retrogression" is the general. This non-retrogression has ten manifestations: non-retrogression in hearing Dharma is dhāraṇī; non-retrogression in delighting in expounding is delighting in expounding eloquence; non-retrogression in speaking is turning the non-retrogressive Dharma wheel; non-retrogression in relying on good friends is making offerings to hundreds and thousands of Buddhas and planting roots of virtues; non-retrogression in cutting off doubt is being praised by the Buddhas; non-retrogression in entering affairs is cultivating the body with compassion; non-retrogression in entering the realm of all-wisdom as it really is is well entering Buddha-wisdom; non-retrogression in relying on self-emptiness and dharma-emptiness is penetrating great wisdom; non-retrogression in entering the realm as it really is is arriving at the other shore; non-retrogression in what should be done and what is done is ferrying hundreds and thousands of sentient beings. Therefore, the first general clause is the upper branch, and the subsequent particular clauses are the lower branch. The "horizontal" praise of the First Abode's virtues in this commentary accords with this intent.**

**The treatise also says: "Second, the gate of gathering and taking up affairs: it manifests in what kind of pure ground bodhisattvas dwell, by what kind of expedient means, in what kind of object-realm, and what kind of should-do and done." If one follows this meaning, it is also acceptable to do a "vertical" praise of bodhisattva virtues.**

---

**觀心解歎德者，不退轉如前說。陀羅尼者，空觀是旋陀羅尼，假觀是百千旋陀羅尼，中觀是法音方便陀羅尼。又空觀觀心但有名字，即聞持陀羅尼；假觀觀心無量心，心、心數法皆是法門，即行持陀羅尼；中觀觀心，心即實相，即是義持陀羅尼。假觀觀心具十法界法，即法無礙辯；中觀觀心十法界皆入實相，即義無礙辯；空觀觀心十法界但有名字語言，即辭無礙辯。觀一心即三心，三心即一心，一界一切界，旋轉無礙，即樂說無礙辯。空觀是轉位不退法輪，假觀是轉行不退法輪，中觀是轉念不退法輪。供養佛者，秖是隨順佛語。今順佛教修三觀心，即是供養佛；為破五住得解脫故，即供養法；三諦理和即供養僧。又眾行心資觀智心，即供養佛；觀智心開發境界，即供養法；境智心和即供養僧。實相心是觀智心本，觀智心是眾行心本，得本種植則立，故言植眾德本。觀智心冥於境界，境界印於觀智，智有所照常與境合，即是為佛所歎。空觀為法緣慈所薰，假觀為眾生緣慈所薰，中觀為無緣慈所薰。空觀入通佛慧，假觀入別佛慧，中觀入圓佛慧。空觀到一切智彼岸，假觀到道種智彼岸，中觀到一切種智彼岸。空觀聞於真諦，假觀聞於俗諦，中觀普聞中道第一義諦，亦普聞三諦。空觀度四住百千眾生，假觀度塵沙百千眾生，中觀度無明百千眾生。一心三觀有無量德，歎不能盡，止略說耳。**

**In terms of contemplating-the-mind and interpreting the praise of virtues: non-retrogression is as discussed above. As for dhāraṇī: the emptiness contemplation is the "revolving dhāraṇī"; the provisional contemplation is the "hundreds-and-thousands revolving dhāraṇī"; the middle contemplation is the "Dharma-sound expedient dhāraṇī."**
*[Critical apparatus: [6] 名【大】，〔－〕【甲】; [7] 字語言【大】，空言語【甲】; [＊4-1] 秖【大】＊，只【甲】＊]*


**Further: in contemplating the mind with the emptiness contemplation, there are only names - this is "dhāraṇī of hearing-and-holding." In contemplating the mind with the provisional contemplation, there are immeasurable minds; mind and mind-factors dharmas are all Dharma-gates - this is "dhāraṇī of practicing-and-holding." In contemplating the mind with the middle contemplation, mind is precisely reality-mark - this is "dhāraṇī of holding meaning."**

**In the provisional contemplation, contemplating the mind as complete with the dharmas of the Ten Dharma Realms is unobstructed eloquence in dharmas. In the middle contemplation, contemplating the mind as all Ten Dharma Realms entering reality-mark is unobstructed eloquence in meaning. In the emptiness contemplation, contemplating the mind as the Ten Dharma Realms having only names and language is unobstructed eloquence in phrasing. Contemplating one mind as precisely three minds, and three minds as precisely one mind - one realm is all realms - revolving without obstruction - is unobstructed eloquence in delighting in expounding.**

**The emptiness contemplation is turning the non-retrogressive Dharma wheel of position; the provisional contemplation is turning the non-retrogressive Dharma wheel of practice; the middle contemplation is turning the non-retrogressive Dharma wheel of thought.**

**As for making offerings to the Buddha: it is simply following the Buddha's words. Now, in following the Buddha's teaching and cultivating the three contemplations of mind, that is making offerings to the Buddha. Because it breaks the Five Abodes and attains liberation, that is making offerings to the Dharma. Because the principles of the Three Truths harmonize, that is making offerings to the Sangha. Also: the mind of myriad practices supports the mind of contemplative wisdom - that is offering Buddha; the mind of contemplative wisdom opens and develops the object-realm - that is offering Dharma; and the object and the wisdom harmonize - that is offering Sangha.**

**The reality-mark mind is the root of the contemplative-wisdom mind; the contemplative-wisdom mind is the root of the myriad-practices mind. Obtaining the root, the planting stands - therefore it is said to plant roots of virtues. When the contemplative-wisdom mind merges with the object-realm, the object-realm seals the contemplative wisdom; the wisdom that illuminates is constantly united with the object - this is being praised by the Buddhas.**

**The emptiness contemplation is perfumed by Dharma-conditions compassion; the provisional contemplation is perfumed by sentient-being-conditions compassion; the middle contemplation is perfumed by unconditioned compassion. The emptiness contemplation enters Shared Buddha-wisdom; the provisional contemplation enters Distinct Buddha-wisdom; the middle contemplation enters Perfect Buddha-wisdom. The emptiness contemplation arrives at the other shore of all-wisdom; the provisional contemplation arrives at the other shore of knowledge-of-paths; the middle contemplation arrives at the other shore of all-seed wisdom. The emptiness contemplation hears the ultimate truth; the provisional contemplation hears the conventional truth; the middle contemplation universally hears the Middle Way, the ultimate truth, and also universally hears the Three Truths. The emptiness contemplation ferries hundreds and thousands of sentient beings of the Four Abodes; the provisional contemplation ferries hundreds and thousands of sentient beings of dust-and-sand; the middle contemplation ferries hundreds and thousands of sentient beings of ignorance. The one-mind three contemplations has immeasurable virtues; praise cannot exhaust them - only brief statements are made.**

**五、列名者，大士大名，或從法門，或從行德，或從本願，雖是一名備無量義，今依經、依觀，銷十八菩薩名。**

**5. Listing names: the great beings have great names - some are from Dharma-gates, some from virtuous practices, and some from fundamental vows. Although each is a single name, it fully contains immeasurable meanings. Now, relying on the sutra and relying on contemplation, [Zhiyi] interprets the names of the eighteen bodhisattvas.**

---

**「文殊師利」，此云妙德，《大經》云：「了了見佛性，猶如妙德等。」《無行經》云「滿殊尸利」，《普超》云「濡首」，《思益》云：「雖說諸法而不起法相、不起非法相，故名妙德。」《悲花》云：「願我行菩薩道，所化眾生皆於十方先成正覺，令我天眼悉皆見之，我之國土皆一生菩薩，悉令從我勸發道心，我行菩薩道無有齊限。寶藏佛言：『汝作功德甚深甚深，願取妙土，今故號汝名文殊師利，在北方歡喜世界作佛，號歡喜藏摩尼寶積佛。』」今猶現在，聞名滅四重罪，為菩薩像，影響釋迦耳。觀心性理，三德祕密，不縱不橫故名妙德。**

**"Manjuśrī" (文殊師利) is translated as Wondrous Virtue. The *Mahā-sūtra* says: "Clearly seeing Buddha-nature, like Wondrous Virtue and others." The *Anavatapta?* (*Wuxing Jing*) calls him "Mañjuśrī." The *Puchao* calls him "Moist Head." The *Siyi* says: "Although he preaches all dharmas, he does not give rise to dharma-marks and does not give rise to non-dharma-marks; therefore he is named Wondrous Virtue." The *Sorrowful Flower* says: "May I practice the bodhisattva path, and may the sentient beings I transform all first attain unsurpassed awakening in the ten directions, so that with my deva-eye I can see them all. In my Buddha-land, all will be one-life bodhisattvas; may they all, following me, be encouraged to arouse the path-mind. May my practice of the bodhisattva path have no limit." The Buddha Ratnagarbha said: "You make virtues that are very deep, very deep. May you vow to take a wondrous land. Now therefore I name you Manjuśrī. In the northern world of Joy you will become Buddha, named Joyful-Treasury Maṇi-Jewel-Accumulation Buddha."**

**Now he still exists: hearing his name eradicates the Four Heavy offenses. As the image of a bodhisattva, he is the "shadow and influence" of Śākyamuni. In contemplating mind-nature and principle: the three virtues are secret and neither vertical nor horizontal - therefore he is named Wondrous Virtue.**

---

**「觀世音」者，天竺云婆婁吉底稅。《思益》云：「若眾生見者，即時畢定得於菩提，稱名者得免眾苦，故名觀音。」《悲花》云：「若有眾生受苦，稱我名者、念我者，為我天耳、天眼所見聞，不得免苦，不取正覺。寶藏佛云：『汝觀一切眾生生大悲心，今當字汝為觀世音。』」此下文自釋名(云云)。**

**As for "Avalokiteśvara" (觀世音): in India it is called Avalokiteśvara. The *Siyi* says: "If sentient beings see [him], at that time they are certainly able to attain bodhi; if they recite the name, they are able to be free from the multitude of sufferings; therefore he is named 'Observing Sounds.'" The *Sorrowful Flower* says: "If there are sentient beings who suffer, and if they recite my name or contemplate me, and [yet], as seen and heard by my deva-ear and deva-eye, they cannot be freed from suffering, then I will not take unsurpassed awakening." The Buddha Ratnagarbha said: "You observe all sentient beings and give rise to great compassionate mind; now I shall name you Avalokiteśvara." The text below itself explains the name (and so on).**

---

**觀心釋者，三智名觀，三諦名世，三觀是語，本故名音。**

**Interpreted by contemplating the mind: the three wisdoms are called "observing"; the three truths are called "world"; the three contemplations are the "speech" and, as the root, are therefore called "sound."**

**As for "Mahāsthāmaprāpta" (得大勢): the *Siyi* says: "Wherever I set my foot, it shakes the three-thousand great thousand-world system and the māra palaces; therefore I am named Mahāsthāmaprāpta." The *Sorrowful Flower* says: "May my Buddha-land be no different from Avalokiteśvara's." The Buddha Ratnagarbha said: "Because you vowed to take the great thousand-world system, I now name you Mahāsthāmaprāpta."**

**As for "Never Resting" (不休息): the *Siyi* says: "Ganges-sand kalpas make one day and night; thirty such days make a month; twelve months make a year. After passing a hundred thousand *hundred-million* *hundred-million* kalpas, one meets one Buddha. Thus, meeting Ganges-sand Buddhas, practicing brahmacarya and cultivating merits - only then does one receive a prediction. Because the mind does not rest, it is called Never Resting."**

---

**觀心者，觀空不住空，出假不住假，而入中不住中，雙照二諦名不休息。**

**As for contemplating the mind: in contemplating emptiness, one does not abide in emptiness; in going out into the provisional, one does not abide in the provisional; and in entering the middle, one does not abide in the middle. Simultaneously illuminating the Two Truths is called Never Resting.**

**As for "Jeweled Palm" (寶掌): the *Puchao* says: "Wearing the armor of superior virtue, up to and including Buddhas there are none who can defeat [him]. He enables the explanation of the Great Vehicle. Even in dreams, he does not set his intent on the two vehicles. Constantly with the true mind and the mind of supernormal wisdom, he lectures and proclaims for others. In regard to jewels, the mind is without stinginess; therefore he is named Jeweled Palm."**

---

**觀心者，不思議三諦名之為寶，一心三觀名之為掌，以此觀掌執此諦寶，自利、利他故云寶掌。**

**As for contemplating the mind: the inconceivable Three Truths are called jewels; the one-mind three contemplations are called the palm. With this contemplative palm holding these truth-jewels, benefiting self and benefiting others, therefore it is called Jeweled Palm.**

**As for "Bhagavān of Medicine" / "Medicine King" (藥王): the *Sorrowful Flower* says: "May I make offerings to all one thousand and four Buddhas of the Bhadrakalpa when they first attain the Way. When all Buddhas enter extinction, may I raise stupas for them. When the kalpa is exhausted and there are sufferings, may I rescue and protect. In times of weapons and epidemics, may I act as a great medicine king, and only afterward become Buddha." The Buddha Ratnagarbha said: "Now I shall name you Fire-Purified Medicine King; later, when you become Buddha, [you will be] the Tathāgata Samudgata." Interpreted by contemplating the mind (and so on). Below this, the explanations for seven bodhisattvas are missing.**

**「跋陀婆羅」者，此言善守，亦云賢守。《思益》云：「若眾生聞名者，畢定得三菩提，故名善守。」**

---

**觀解者，中道正觀，於諸善中最為上首，故言善守。**

**In terms of contemplation and understanding: rightly contemplating the Middle Way is foremost among all goods; therefore it is called Good Guard.**

**「彌勒」者，此云慈氏。《思益》云：「若眾生見者，即得慈心三昧，故名慈氏。」《賢愚》云：「國王見象師調象，即慈心生，從是得名慈氏。」《悲花》云：「發願於刀火劫中擁護眾生。」**

**As for "Maitreya" (彌勒): this is translated as "Clan of Compassion." The *Siyi* says: "If sentient beings see [him], they immediately attain the samādhi of the compassionate mind; therefore he is named Clan of Compassion." The *Xianyu* says: "When a king saw an elephant-trainer training an elephant, a compassionate mind arose; from this he got the name Clan of Compassion." The *Sorrowful Flower* says: "He vows to protect sentient beings in kalpas of knives and fire."**

**今觀解者，中道正觀即是無緣大慈，慈善根力令諸心數皆入同體大慈法中，離諸不善，故稱慈氏。又云慈乃姓也，名阿逸多，此翻無勝，下文(云云)。此下欠釋寶積。**

**Now, in terms of contemplation and understanding: rightly contemplating the Middle Way is precisely the great unconditioned compassion. The power of compassion's good roots causes all mind-factors to enter the Dharma of great compassion of the same substance, departing from all unwholesome [dharmas]; therefore he is called Clan of Compassion. It is also said that "Compassion" is the clan name, and the personal name is Ajita (阿逸多), translated as "Unsurpassed"; [this appears] in the text below (and so on). Below this, the explanation for Ratnakūṭa (寶積) is missing.**

**「導師」者，《思益》云：「於墮邪道眾生，生大悲心令入正道，不求恩報，故名導師。」**

**As for "Guide" (導師): the *Siyi* says: "Toward sentient beings who have fallen into wrong paths, he gives rise to a great compassionate mind and causes them to enter the right path; he does not seek gratitude or recompense; therefore he is named Guide."**

---

**觀解者，三觀妙智導一切行，不墜二邊，皆入正觀，故名導師。未釋者，俟後追註(云云)。**

**In terms of contemplation and understanding: the wondrous wisdom of the Three Contemplations guides all practices, not falling into the two extremes, and all enter right contemplation; therefore it is named Guide. Those not yet explained will be supplemented later in annotations (and so on).**

## 11. THE MIXED ASSEMBLY (雜眾)

**第三列雜眾者，舊云凡夫眾，此中有聖；舊云俗眾，此中有道；舊云天人眾，此中有龍鬼；皆不便。今呼為雜眾，意則兼矣，所謂五道、二界、八番，是故言雜。方等經亦列地獄，《中陰經》亦化無色，此皆隨機適現，不可一例作並，復不可定其次第。舊云人是土主，讓諸客在前，《無量義經》秖與此經同席，明國王、國臣，國民、士女，不論賓主相讓。出經家趣列在文，或有別意未詳。今觀此文有八番，先標帝釋，次列四王，前龍後鳥，鬼神重出，為此義故呼為雜眾，不可言其次第。又雜眾者，此中有得道、未得道者，雜果報與形服雜，故言雜。其中得二乘道者，無漏智與無明煩惱雜，故言雜；其中得菩薩道者，漚和與眾機雜，故言雜；其中得佛道者，一法具一切法，故言雜。雜義如是，豈可以凡夫形俗判之，復不可以五道人天等判之，故言雜也。此是約教釋(云云)。**

**Third is listed the "mixed assembly." The old [interpretations] said it is an assembly of ordinary people, yet here there are sages; said it is a worldly assembly, yet here there is the Way; said it is a deva-and-human assembly, yet here there are dragons and ghosts - all of these are unsuitable. Now it is called the mixed assembly, because the meaning includes them all: namely, the five destinies, the two realms, and eight groupings - therefore it is called "mixed." Vaipulya sutras also list hell; the *Intermediate-State Sutra* also teaches the formless - all of these appear in accord with capacities; one cannot make a single rule and line them up, and one also cannot fix their sequence.**
*[Critical apparatus: [10] 呼【大】，呼報【甲】; [11] 之【大】，〔－〕【甲】]*


**The old [interpretation] said humans are the local hosts and therefore let the guests be listed first; yet the *Infinite Meaning Sutra* sits in the same seat as this sutra and clarifies kings, ministers, citizens, men and women, without discussing host/guest deference. The sutra-compilers arranged the list in the text; perhaps there is another intent not yet understood. Now, observing this text, there are eight groupings: first it marks Indra; next it lists the Four Kings; dragons come before birds; ghosts and spirits appear again - because of this meaning it is called the mixed assembly, and one cannot speak of its sequence.**

**Furthermore, the mixed assembly includes those who have attained the path and those who have not; mixed fruit-retributions and mixed forms and clothing - therefore it is called mixed. Among those who attain the two-vehicle path, outflow-free wisdom is mixed with ignorance and afflictions - therefore it is called mixed. Among those who attain the bodhisattva path, the harmony of expedients and the capacities of the assembly are mixed - therefore it is called mixed. Among those who attain the Buddha path, one dharma contains all dharmas - therefore it is called mixed. Such is the meaning of "mixed": how could one judge it by the secular form of ordinary people, or judge it by categories such as the five destinies and devas/humans? Therefore it is called mixed. This is interpreting it by way of the teachings (and so on).**

### Śakra Devānām Indra (釋提桓因)

**「釋提桓因」，因陀羅，或云旃提羅，此翻能作，作忉利天主。忉利此翻三十三，四面各八城，就喜見城合三十三，共居須彌頂。須彌，此翻安明，四寶所成，高廣三百三十六萬里，此是欲天之主，故前列。《雜阿含》四十云：「有一比丘問佛：『何故名釋提桓因？』答：『本為人時行於頓施，堪能作主，故名釋提桓因。』『何故名富蘭陀羅？』『為人時數數行施故。』『何故名摩伽婆？』『本為人時名故。』『何故名娑婆羅？』『本為人時此衣布施故。』『何故名憍尸迦？』『本為人時姓故。』『何故名舍脂鉢低？』『舍脂是婦，鉢低是夫。』『何故名千眼？』『本為人時聰明，於一時坐思千種義，觀察稱量，故名千眼。』『何故名因提利？』『為三十二天主。』」《瓔珞》第三云：「天帝名拘翼。」**

**"Śakra Devānām Indra" (釋提桓因): Indra is also called Candira; this is translated as "Able to Act," acting as the lord of the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven. "Trāyastriṃśa" is translated as "Thirty-Three": on each of the four sides there are eight cities, and together with the City of Good-View they make thirty-three, all dwelling atop Mount Sumeru. "Sumeru" is translated as "Stable Brightness"; it is formed of four treasures and is 3,360,000 *lǐ* in height and breadth. This is the lord of the desire heavens; therefore he is listed first.**

**The *Saṃyukta Āgama*, fascicle 40, says: "A bhikṣu asked the Buddha: 'Why is he named Śakra Devānām Indra?' [The Buddha] answered: 'When he was a human, he practiced sudden giving and was capable of acting as a lord; therefore he is named Śakra Devānām Indra.' 'Why is he named Purandara?' 'Because as a human he repeatedly practiced giving.' 'Why is he named Maghavan?' 'Because it was his name when he was a human.' 'Why is he named Śabara?' 'Because as a human he gave this robe-cloth.' 'Why is he named Kauśika?' 'Because it was his clan name when he was a human.' 'Why is he named Śacīpati?' 'Śacī is the wife; pati is the husband.' 'Why is he named Thousand-Eyed?' 'Because as a human he was clever and in one sitting could think a thousand meanings, observe and weigh them; therefore he is named Thousand-Eyed.' 'Why is he named Indriya?' 'Because he is lord of the thirty-two heavens.'" The *Yingluo*, fascicle 3, says: "The name of the Heavenly Emperor is Kōyoku."**

**教門者，《阿含》中帝釋是阿那含，般若明十方，難問般若者，皆名釋提桓因。別、圓中明釋提桓因得首楞嚴三昧，內證不同，過賢劫二千二十四劫作佛，號無著世尊(云云)。**

**In terms of the teaching-gate: in the Āgamas, Indra is an Anāgāmin. In the Prajñā teachings, those who ask difficult questions about prajñā - in the ten directions - are all named Śakra Devānām Indra. In the Distinct and Perfect [Teachings], Indra is clarified as attaining the Śūraṅgama Samādhi; the inner realization differs. After the Bhadrakalpa, in 2,024 kalpas, he will become Buddha, named the World-Honored One "Non-Attached" (and so on).**

---

**本迹者，十住、行、向即三十，十地為一，等覺為二，妙覺為主，同棲第一義天，共服實相甘露即本也，居須彌頂迹也。**

**According to *Fundamental/Trace*: the Ten Abodes, Ten Practices, and Ten Dedications make thirty; the Ten Grounds are one; Equal Awakening is two; Wondrous Awakening is the lord. Together they dwell in the heaven of the Ultimate Meaning and together partake of the nectar of reality-mark - this is the fundamental. Dwelling atop Mount Sumeru is the trace.**

---

**觀心解者，自行十善，勸他隨喜，此三十善皆空、皆假、皆中，即是三十三觀門也。**

**Interpreted by contemplating the mind: practicing the ten wholesome oneself and encouraging others to rejoice - these thirty wholesomes are all empty, all provisional, and all middle - this is precisely the thirty-three contemplation gates.**

**「名月」等三天子，是內臣如卿相，或云是三光天子耳。名月是寶吉祥月天子，大勢至應作；普香是明星天子，虛空藏應作；寶光是寶意日天子，觀世音應作。此即本迹釋也。**

**The three deva sons such as "Name-Moon" are inner ministers, like great officers; or it is said they are simply the deva sons of the three luminaries. Name-Moon is the deva son Treasure-Auspicious-Moon - Mahāsthāmaprāpta corresponds. Universal-Fragrance is the deva son Morning-Star - Ākāśagarbha corresponds. Treasure-Light is the deva son Treasure-Intention-Sun - Avalokiteśvara corresponds. This is interpreting it by Fundamental/Trace.**

---

**觀解者，三觀即二智，三智即三光，從三諦生三智，諦即天、智即子(云云)。**

**In terms of contemplation and understanding: the Three Contemplations are the Two Wisdoms; the Three Wisdoms are the Three Luminaries. From the Three Truths arise the Three Wisdoms: the truths are the devas, and the wisdoms are the sons (and so on).**

### The Four Great Heavenly Kings (四大天王)

**「四大天王」者，帝釋外臣，如武將也，居四寶山，高半須彌，廣二十四萬里。東提頭賴吒，此云持國，亦言安民，居黃金山，領二鬼：揵闥婆、富單那。南毘留勒叉，此云增長，亦云免離，居瑠璃山，領二鬼：薜荔多、鳩槃茶。西毘留博叉，此云非好報，亦云惡眼，亦云雜語，居白銀山，領二鬼：毒龍、毘舍闍。北毘沙門，此云種種聞，亦云多聞，居水精山，領二鬼：羅剎、夜叉。各領二鬼不令惱人，故稱護世。**

**As for "the Four Great Heavenly Kings": they are Indra's outer ministers, like military commanders. They dwell on the four jeweled mountains, half the height of Sumeru and 240,000 *lǐ* in breadth. In the east is Dhṛtarāṣṭra, translated as "Upholding the Nation," also "Pacifying the People"; he dwells on the golden mountain and governs two kinds of spirits: gandharvas and pūtanas. In the south is Virūḍhaka, translated as "Increasing and Growing," also "Freeing from Departure"; he dwells on the lapis mountain and governs pretas and kumbhāṇḍas. In the west is Virūpākṣa, translated as "Not a Good Recompense," also "Evil Eye," also "Mixed Speech"; he dwells on the silver mountain and governs poisonous dragons and piśācas. In the north is Vaiśravaṇa, translated as "Manifold Hearing," also "Much Hearing"; he dwells on the crystal mountain and governs rākṣasas and yakṣas. Each governs two kinds of spirits and does not allow them to torment humans; therefore they are called Protectors of the World.**

**本迹者，本為常樂我淨四王護持佛法，不令外人取其枝葉斫截破壞，常王護東方常、無常雙樹，樂王護南方樂、無樂雙樹，我王護西方我、無我雙樹，淨王護北方淨、不淨雙樹。枝榦喻常，華喻於我，果喻於樂，茂葉喻淨，護此華果，常能利益一切眾生故，迹為四王而護世也。**

**According to *Fundamental/Trace*: fundamentally, the Four Kings of Eternity, Bliss, Self, and Purity protect and uphold the Buddha-Dharma, not allowing outsiders to seize its branches and leaves and chop and destroy them. The King of Eternity protects the eastern Twin Trees of Eternity and Non-Eternity; the King of Bliss protects the southern Twin Trees of Bliss and Non-Bliss; the King of Self protects the western Twin Trees of Self and Non-Self; and the King of Purity protects the northern Twin Trees of Purity and Non-Purity. The branches and trunk are a metaphor for eternity; the flowers are a metaphor for self; the fruit is a metaphor for bliss; and the luxuriant leaves are a metaphor for purity. By protecting these flowers and fruits and constantly benefiting all sentient beings, in trace they become the Four Kings who protect the world.**

---

**觀解者，觀四諦智即是四王，一諦下除愛見二惑，即是護八愛見也。次忉利上有焰摩，此翻善時，《大論》云妙善，去忉利三百三十六萬里。善時上有兜率陀，此翻妙足，去焰摩如地遠，而不列者，略耳。何者？下天鈍、上天著樂，尚知來集，況不著、不鈍而不來耶？**

**In terms of contemplation and understanding: contemplating the wisdom of the Four Truths is precisely the Four Kings. Under a single truth, removing the two afflictions of craving and views is protecting the eight cravings and views. Next, above Trāyastriṃśa there is Yāma, translated as "Good Times"; the *Great Treatise* calls it "Wondrous Good." It is 3,360,000 *lǐ* above Trāyastriṃśa. Above Good Times is Tuṣita, translated as "Wondrous Contentment," as far above Yāma as the earth [is below]. That they are not listed is simply abbreviation. Why? The lower heavens are dull and the higher heavens are attached to pleasures - yet they still know to come and gather. How much more would those who are neither attached nor dull fail to come?**

**「自在」即第五，「大自在」即第六，自化五欲，他化五欲(云云)。有人言，是色界頂大自在。此不應超至彼也。**

**"Mastery" (自在) is the fifth [heaven]; "Great Mastery" (大自在) is the sixth: self-transforming the five desires and other-transforming the five desires (and so on). Some say it is the Great Mastery at the summit of the form realm; this should not leap beyond to that.**

---

**本迹者，此兩天本住自在、自在王等定，迹為兩天耳。**

**According to *Fundamental/Trace*: these two heavens fundamentally abide in samādhis such as Mastery and Mastery-King; in trace, they are just these two heavens.**

---

**觀心者，入空是自在觀，入中是大自在觀(云云)。**

**As for contemplating the mind: entering emptiness is the Mastery contemplation; entering the middle is the Great Mastery contemplation (and so on).**

### The Form-Realm Heavens (色界天)

**次列色界天。「娑婆」，此翻忍，其土眾生安於十惡不肯出離，從人名土，故稱為忍。《悲花經》云：「云何名娑婆？是諸眾生忍受三毒及諸煩惱，故名忍土。」亦名雜，雜九道共居(云云)。「梵」者，此翻離欲，除下地繫，上升色界，故名離欲，亦稱高淨。「尸棄」者，此翻為頂髻，又外國喚火為樹提尸棄，此王本修火光定，破欲界惑，從德立名。然經標梵王，復舉尸棄，似如兩人，依《釋論》正以尸棄為王，今經舉位顯名，恐目一人耳。住禪中間，內有覺觀，外有言說，得主領為王，單修禪為梵民，加四無量心為王也。初禪有梵眾、梵輔、大梵，今舉王攝諸也。**

**Next the form-realm heavens are listed. "Sahā" (娑婆) is translated as "endurance": the sentient beings in that land settle in the ten evils and are unwilling to depart; the land is named from the people and is therefore called the land of endurance. The *Sorrowful Flower Sutra* says: "Why is it named Sahā? Because the sentient beings endure the three poisons and various afflictions; therefore it is called the land of endurance." It is also called "mixed," because the nine paths dwell together (and so on).**

**"Brahmā" (梵) is translated as "departing desire": removing the bonds of the lower ground and ascending to the form realm; therefore it is named departing desire, and is also called lofty purity. "Śikhin" (尸棄) is translated as "topknot." Also, in foreign lands, fire is called "śikhin." This king originally cultivated the samādhi of fire-light and broke the delusions of the desire realm; he is named from virtue. Yet the sutra marks the Brahmā King and again raises Śikhin; it seems like two people. According to the *Treatise*, it is precisely Śikhin who is king; this sutra raises the rank to display the name - it may refer to one person only.**

**Dwelling between dhyānas: internally there is vitarka and vicāra, and externally there is speech; attaining lordship, he is king. Those who cultivate dhyāna alone are Brahmā citizens; those who add the Four Immeasurables are kings. The first dhyāna has the Brahmā assembly, Brahmā ministers, and Great Brahmā; now it raises the king to include them all.**

**「光明」者，二禪也，此有少光、無量光、光音；三禪有少淨、無量淨、遍淨；四禪有密身亦無挂礙、無量密亦受福、密果亦廣果、無想密亦無想。又有五那含：不煩、不熱、善見、善現、色究竟亦大自在即摩醯首羅，經文存略不具出，但等等此諸天也。例有教門、本迹、觀心，自思之。**

**"Light" (光明) refers to the second dhyāna: it has Limited Light, Immeasurable Light, and Light-Sound. The third dhyāna has Limited Purity, Immeasurable Purity, and Pervasive Purity. The fourth dhyāna has Secret-Body (also called Non-Obstruction), Immeasurable Secret (also called Receiving Blessing), Secret Fruit (also called Vast Fruit), and Non-Thought Secret (also called Non-Thought).**

**There are also the five Anāgāmins: No-Affliction, No-Heat, Good-View, Good-Manifestation, and Form's Ultimate - also Great Mastery, namely Maheśvara. The sutra text is abbreviated and does not fully list them; it only says "and so on," meaning these various heavens. By analogy there are teaching-gate, Fundamental/Trace, and contemplating-the-mind interpretations - reflect on them yourself.**

### The Eight Dragon Kings (八龍)

**次列八龍者，「難陀」名歡喜，「跋」名善，兄弟常護摩竭提，雨澤以時，國無饑年，瓶沙王年為一會，百姓聞皆歡喜，從此得名，即目連所降者也，居海中。**

**Next the eight dragons are listed. "Nanda" means Joy; "Bhadra" means Good. The two brothers constantly protect Magadha, sending timely rains so that the kingdom has no famine years. Each year of King Bimbisāra is one occasion; hearing of it, the hundred families all rejoice - from this they obtained the name. They are those subdued by Maudgalyāyana, dwelling in the sea.**

---

**本迹解者，本住歡喜地，迹居海間。**

**According to Fundamental/Trace: fundamentally they dwell in the Joy Ground; in trace they dwell within the sea.**

---

**觀解者，三觀即中道，生法喜也。**

**In terms of contemplation and understanding: the Three Contemplations are precisely the Middle Way, giving rise to Dharma-joy.**

---

**「娑伽羅」，從居海受名，《華嚴》所稱，舊云因國得名。本住智度大海，迹處滄溟。**

**"Sāgara" (娑伽羅) is named from dwelling in the sea, as called in the *Avataṃsaka*; the old [interpretation] says it is named from a country. Fundamentally, [it] abides in the great sea of wisdom-transcendence; in trace it dwells in the blue ocean.**

---

**「和修吉」，此云多頭，亦云寶稱，居於水中。本住普現色身三昧，迹示多頭也。觀者，入假之觀，分別無量法門也(云云)。**

**"Vāsuki" (和修吉) is translated as "Many Heads," also "Jeweled Name," dwelling in the water. Fundamentally, [it] abides in the samādhi of universally manifesting form-bodies; in trace it displays many heads. In terms of contemplation: entering the provisional contemplation discriminates immeasurable Dharma-gates (and so on).**

---

**「德叉迦」，此云現毒，亦云多舌，或云兩舌，本住樂說無礙辯法門，迹示多舌。「阿那婆達多」，從池得名，此云無熱。無熱池，《長阿含》十八云：「雪山頂有池，名阿耨達池，中有五柱堂，從池為名，龍王常處其中。閻浮提諸龍有三患：一、熱風、熱沙著身，燒皮肉及骨髓以為苦惱；二、惡風暴起吹其宮殿，失寶飾衣等，龍身自現以為苦惱；三、諸龍娛樂時，金翅鳥入宮，搏撮始生龍子食之，怖懼熱惱。此池無三患，若鳥起心欲往即便命終，故名無熱惱池也。」本住清涼常樂我淨，迹處涼池。觀者，三觀妙慧，淨五住之煩唼，免二死之熱沙(云云)。**

**"Takṣaka" (德叉迦) is translated as "Manifest Poison," also "Many Tongues," or "Two Tongues." Fundamentally, [it] abides in the Dharma-gate of delighting in expounding unobstructed eloquence; in trace it displays many tongues.**

**"Anavatapta" (阿那婆達多) is named from a lake; this is translated as "No Heat." The No-Heat Lake: the *Dīrgha Āgama*, fascicle 18, says: "On the summit of the Snow Mountains there is a lake named Anavatapta Lake. Within it is a hall with five pillars. Named from the lake, the Dragon King constantly dwells within. The dragons of Jambudvīpa have three afflictions: (1) hot winds and hot sand attach to the body, burning skin, flesh, and even bone marrow, causing suffering and distress; (2) violent bad winds arise and blow their palaces away, losing jeweled ornaments, clothing, and so on, and the dragon body itself appears, causing suffering and distress; (3) when dragons amuse themselves, the garuḍa enters the palace and seizes and eats newly-born dragon children, causing fearful distress and heat. This lake has none of the three afflictions. If the bird gives rise to the intention to go [there], it immediately dies; therefore it is called the No-Heat-Annoyance Lake."**

**Fundamentally, [it] abides in coolness and in Eternity, Bliss, Self, and Purity; in trace it dwells at the cool lake. In terms of contemplation: the wondrous wisdom of the Three Contemplations purifies the gnawing afflictions of the Five Abodes and avoids the hot sands of the two deaths (and so on).**

### More Classes Among the Mixed Assembly

**「摩那斯」，此云大身，或大意、大力等。修羅排海淹喜見城，此龍縈身以遏海水。本住無邊身法門，迹為大體。觀者，中道正觀其性廣博(云云)。**

**"Manas" (摩那斯) is translated as "Great Body," or "Great Intent," "Great Strength," and so on. When asuras push through the sea and flood the City of Good-View, this dragon coils its body to dam the ocean waters. Fundamentally, [it] abides in the Dharma-gate of the boundless body; in trace it is "great body." In terms of contemplation: rightly contemplating the Middle Way, its nature is broad and vast (and so on).**

---

**「漚鉢羅」，此云黛色蓮華池，龍依住，從池得名。本住法華三昧，迹居此池。觀者，三觀即是修因，因即蓮華也。《正法念經》云：「龍為諸天保境，修羅興兵前與龍鬪。」故知為天所管也。**

**"Utpala" (漚鉢羅) is "the blue-lotus-flower pool." A dragon relies on it and dwells there and is named from the pool. Fundamentally, [it] abides in the Lotus Samādhi; in trace it dwells in this pool. In terms of contemplation: the Three Contemplations are precisely the cultivating cause; the cause itself is the lotus flower. The *Zhengfa nian jing* says: "Dragons guard the borders for the devas; when asuras raise armies, first they fight the dragons." Therefore we know they are governed by the devas.**

---

**次列四緊那羅，亦云真陀羅，此云疑神，似人而有一角，故號人非人。天帝法樂神，居十寶山，身有異相即上奏樂。佛時說法，諸天弦歌、般遮于瑟而頌法門。舊云：「法緊奏四諦，妙緊奏十二因緣，大緊奏六度，持緊總奏前三。」今言奏四教法門也。本住不可思議，不起滅定安禪合掌，以千萬偈讚諸法王，迹寄弦管歌詠十力。觀者，觀音聲即空、即假、即中，隨順三諦即是讚佛也。**

**Next are listed four kinnaras, also called Candra. This is translated as "doubtful spirit": resembling humans but having a single horn, therefore called "human but not human." They are Indra's Dharma-music spirits, dwelling on the Ten-Jeweled Mountain. When their bodies show unusual marks, they immediately go up and perform music. When the Buddha teaches the Dharma, the devas sing with strings and with instruments and praise the Dharma-gates.**

**The old [interpretation] said: "The Dharma kinnara plays the Four Truths; the wondrous kinnara plays the Twelve Links; the great kinnara plays the Six Perfections; the preserving kinnara plays the prior three as a whole." Now it says they play the Dharma-gates of the Four Teachings. Fundamentally, [they] abide in the inconceivable, without-arising-and-ceasing samādhi, peacefully sitting in dhyāna with palms joined, praising all Dharma Kings with tens of thousands of verses; in trace they borrow strings and pipes to sing the Ten Powers. In terms of contemplation: contemplate that sound itself is empty, provisional, and middle - according with the Three Truths - this is praising the Buddha.**

---

**四乾闥婆，此云嗅香，以香為食，亦云香陰，其身出香，此是天帝俗樂之神也。樂者幢倒伎也，樂音者，鼓節弦管也，美者幢倒中勝品者，美音者弦管中勝者也。**

**The four gandharvas: this is translated as "sniffing fragrance"; they take fragrance as food. It is also called "fragrance-shadow": their bodies emit fragrance. These are the spirits of Indra's worldly music. "Music" is the banner-and-tumbling performers; "music sounds" are drums, clappers, and strings and pipes. "Beautiful" are those superior among banner-and-tumbling; "beautiful sounds" are those superior among strings and pipes.**

---

**「阿修羅」者，此云無酒，四天下採花醞於大海，魚龍業力其味不變，瞋妬誓斷，故言無酒神，亦云不端，彌天安師云「質諒」。質諒，直信也。此神諂曲，不與名相稱。有二種：鬼道攝者，居大海邊；畜生道攝者，居大海底。**

**"Asura" (阿修羅) is translated as "no wine": throughout the four continents they gather flowers and brew [them] in the great sea. By the karma-power of fish and dragons, the taste does not change. Out of anger and jealousy they vow to abstain; therefore it is called the spirit of no-wine. It is also called "not upright." Master Mitian'an says it is "true and trustworthy." "True and trustworthy" means straight faith. Yet these spirits are flattering and crooked; their names do not match their characteristics. There are two kinds: those included in the ghost-destiny dwell at the seashore; those included in the animal-destiny dwell at the bottom of the sea.**

---

**「婆稚」者，此云被縛，或云五處被縛，或云五惡，物繫頸不得脫故云被縛。亦云有縛，為帝釋所縛。本能五繫，繫魔外道，迹為此像耳。《正法華》云「最勝觀」者，以三觀智，縛五住惑，入實際中。**

**"Vaji" (婆稚) is translated as "bound": some say bound in five places; some say five evils. Because things are tied to the neck and cannot be removed, it is called bound. It is also called "having bondage," being bound by Indra. Fundamentally, [it] can bind the five bonds and bind māras and non-Buddhists; in trace it appears as this image. The *Zhengfahua* says "Supreme Contemplation": by the wisdom of the Three Contemplations, one binds the delusions of the Five Abodes and enters the reality-limit.**

---

**「佉羅騫馱」，此云廣肩胛，亦云惡陰，涌海水者，《正》本云寶錦。本住權、實二智，慈荷眾生故，迹為廣肩胛。觀者，三觀能鼓覆五住生死大海也。**

**"Kharaskandha" (佉羅騫馱) is translated as "broad shoulders," also "evil aggregate." The one who surges the sea waters: the *Zheng* version calls him Jeweled Brocade. Fundamentally, [he] abides in the two wisdoms of provisional and real; because compassion bears and carries sentient beings, in trace he is "broad shoulders." In terms of contemplation: the Three Contemplations can drum and cover the great sea of birth-and-death of the Five Abodes.**

---

**「毘摩質多」此云淨心，亦云種種疑，波海水出聲，名毘摩質多，即舍脂父也。《觀佛三昧》云：「光音天生此地，地使有欲，入海洗不淨，墮泥變為卵，八千歲生一女，千頭少一，二十四手。此女戲于水，水精入身，八千歲生一男，二十四頭，千手少一，海水波音名為毘摩質多。索乾闥婆女，生舍脂，帝釋業力令其父居七寶殿，納為妻，後讒其父，遂交兵，脚波海水、手攻喜見，帝釋以般若呪力，不能為害。」《正》本云「燕居」。本者色心本淨，迹為此名。觀者，正觀中道即是淨心。**

**"Vemacitrin" (毘摩質多) is translated as "Pure Mind"; it is also translated as "various doubts." As the sound of waves in the sea waters, it is called Vemacitrin; he is Śacī's father. The *Contemplation of Buddha Samādhi* says: "From the Ābhāsvara Heaven, [a being] was born on this earth. The earth caused desire. Entering the sea to wash away impurity, he fell into mud and transformed into an egg. At eight thousand years, a girl was born: one thousand heads minus one, and twenty-four hands. This girl played in the water; a water-essence entered her body. At eight thousand years, she gave birth to a boy: twenty-four heads, and one thousand hands minus one. The wave-sounds of the sea waters are named Vemacitrin. He sought a gandharva daughter and she gave birth to Śacī. By Indra's karma-power, he caused her father to dwell in a seven-jeweled palace and took her as wife. Later she slandered her father and they went to war: his feet made waves in the sea waters and his hands attacked the City of Good-View. By Indra's prajñā mantra-power, he could not do harm." The *Zheng* version calls him "Swallow-Dwelling." Fundamentally, form and mind are originally pure; in trace he bears this name. In contemplation: rightly contemplating the Middle Way is precisely the pure mind.**

---

**「羅睺羅」，此云障持，障持日月者也，是畜生種，身長八萬四千由旬，口廣千由旬，寶珠嚴身，觀天女天園林，若四天下人，孝養父母、供養沙門者，諸天有威力，上空雨刀；若不爾，諸天入宮不出。又日放光照其眼，不能得見，舉手掌障日，世人咸言日蝕怪險，種種邪說；掩月亦如是。或作大聲，世人言天獸吼，險亂王衰，種種邪說。怖日月時，倍大其身氣呵日月，日月失光。來訴佛，佛告羅睺：「莫吞日月。」羅睺支節戰動，身流白汗，即放日月，日月力、眾生力、佛力，眾因緣故不能為害。昔有婆羅門聰明廣施，四千車載食，於曠野施。有一佛塔，惡人所燒，即以四千車載水滅火救塔，歡喜發願，願得大身，欲界第一。既無正信、好鬪愛戰、喜施，故生光明城，作羅睺羅修羅主也。《正》本云「吸氣」。本、觀(云云)。**

**"Rāhu" (羅睺羅) is translated as "obstructing and holding" - one who obstructs and holds the sun and moon. It is of the animal type. Its body is 84,000 yojanas long, its mouth is a thousand yojanas wide, and jeweled pearls adorn its body. It observes the deva maidens and deva parks. If the people of the four continents are filial to parents and make offerings to śramaṇas, the devas have mighty power and rain knives from the sky above; if not, the devas enter the palace and do not come out.**

**Further, when the sun emits light and shines on its eyes, it cannot see; it raises its hand and palm to obstruct the sun. People all say there is a strange and dangerous solar eclipse - various wrong theories. Covering the moon is also so. Sometimes it makes a great sound; people say heavenly beasts roar and that danger and disorder mean kings decline - various wrong theories. When it frightens the sun and moon, it doubles its body and exhales energy at the sun and moon, and the sun and moon lose their light. It came to complain to the Buddha. The Buddha told Rāhu: "Do not swallow the sun and moon." Rāhu's joints trembled and his body flowed with white sweat; it immediately released the sun and moon. By the power of the sun and moon, the power of sentient beings, and the power of the Buddha, by the many causal conditions it could not do harm.**

**In the past there was a brahmin, intelligent and broadly generous, who carried food on four thousand carts and gave in the wilderness. There was a Buddha-stūpa burned by evil people; he used four thousand carts of water to extinguish the fire and rescue the stūpa. Rejoicing, he made a vow: may I attain a great body, foremost in the desire realm. Because he lacked right faith, delighted in fighting and loving war, and delighted in giving, he was born in the City of Light and became the asura lord Rāhu. The *Zheng* version calls this "inhaling breath." Fundamental and contemplation (and so on).**

### The Four Garuḍas (迦樓羅)

**次列四迦樓羅，此云金翅，翅翮金色，居四天下大樹上，兩翅相去三百三十六萬里，有人言：《莊子》呼為鵬，鵬行眾鳥翼之，亦稱為鳳皇。私謂鳳不踐生草，噉竹實，棲乳桐；金翅噉龍，云何是類？「大威德」者，威勝群輩，又威攝諸龍也，《正》本云「具足」。「大身」者，大群輩也。「大滿」者，龍恒充滿己意也。「如意」者，頸有此珠也，《正》本云「不可動」。迦樓鳥有神力，雄化為天子，雌變為天女，化己住處有寶宮，亦有百味，而報須食龍，胎能噉胎，不能噉三，卵能噉二，濕能噉三，化能噉四。《觀佛三昧經》云：「正音迦樓，一日山東噉一龍王，五百小龍，三方亦爾，周而復始壽八千年。臨終失勢欲噉龍子，龍母𭋣嘇之不得食，即嗔從金剛山透海，穿地輪過，不能過風輪，風彈之，從故孔湧到金剛山，如是七返，還山頂命終，肉裂火起，將燒寶山，難陀雨雨滅之，肉爛心衝風輪亦七返，墮山上成如意珠，龍得之即為王，人王亦感此珠者也。」**

**Next are listed four garuḍas. This is translated as "golden-winged": their wing-feathers are golden in color. They dwell atop the great trees of the four continents. The two wings are 3,360,000 *lǐ* apart. Some say that in the *Zhuangzi* they are called the *péng*; when the *péng* travels, the myriad birds wing alongside it, and it is also called a phoenix. Privately, [Zhiyi] says: the phoenix does not tread on living grass, eats bamboo fruit, and perches on paulownia; the golden-winged bird eats dragons - how could they be the same kind?**
*[Critical apparatus: [5] 此【大】，〔－〕【甲】]*


**"Great Majestic Virtue" means its might surpasses the multitude and also subdues dragons; the *Zheng* version calls it "complete." "Great Body" means the multitude is great. "Great Fullness" means dragons constantly fill its intent. "Wish-Fulfilling" means its neck has this jewel; the *Zheng* version calls it "immovable."**

**Garuḍas have spiritual power: males transform into deva sons and females transform into deva daughters. Transforming their own dwelling, they have jeweled palaces and also a hundred flavors; yet their karmic recompense requires eating dragons. Those born from womb can eat womb-born (but cannot eat three); those born from eggs can eat two; those born from moisture can eat three; those born by transformation can eat four.**

**The *Contemplation of Buddha Samādhi Sutra* says: "In correct pronunciation it is 'garuḍa.' In one day, east of the mountain it eats one dragon king and five hundred small dragons; the other three directions are likewise. Circling and repeating, its lifespan is eight thousand years. At death, losing its power, it wishes to eat dragon children; the dragon-mothers support and protect them and it cannot eat. Immediately angry, it goes from the Vajra Mountain through the sea, pierces through the earth-wheel, and cannot pass the wind-wheel. The wind rebounds it; from its former hole it gushes back up to the Vajra Mountain. Thus seven times, it returns to the mountain top and dies. Its flesh splits and fire arises, about to burn the jeweled mountain; Nanda rains and extinguishes it. Its flesh rots and the heart strikes the wind-wheel also seven times; it falls on the mountain and becomes a wish-fulfilling jewel. Dragons who obtain it become kings; human kings who likewise respond to this jewel also [become kings]."**

### Humans (人眾)

**次列人者，「韋提希」，母也，翻思惟。頻婆娑羅，此翻模實，父也。「阿闍世」者，未生怨，或呼為婆留支，此云無指，內人將護呼為善見，善見之名本也，無指之稱表迹。《大經》云：「阿闍名不生，世者名怨。」以不生佛性故，則煩惱怨生，煩惱怨生故不見佛性，不生煩惱即見佛性。又阿闍者名不生，世名世法，以世八法所不污故，故名阿闍世，此是本義也。《普超經》云：「阿闍世從文殊懺悔，得柔順忍，命終入賓吒羅地獄，即入、即出，生上方佛土得無生忍，彌勒出時復來此界，名不動菩薩，後當作佛，號淨界如來。」其迹既爾，本豈可量？說《法華》時預清淨眾，至《涅槃》時引逆罪者，何異迦葉於《法華》受記，於《涅槃》不堪付囑？不可迷迹而惑其本也。**

**Next are listed the humans: "Vaidehī" is the mother; it is translated as "Concentration/Contemplation." "Bimbisāra" is translated as "Modeled Reality"; he is the father. "Ajātaśatru" means "unborn enemy." He is also called Vāruci, translated as "No Finger." The inner attendants who nursed him called him Good-View; Good-View is the fundamental name, and "No Finger" is the trace designation.**
*[Critical apparatus: [6] 翻【大】，此翻【甲】; [7] 者【大】＊，〔－〕【甲】＊; [＊7-1] 者【大】＊，〔－〕【甲】＊; [1] 時【大】，世時【甲】; [2] 而惑【大】，或【甲】]*


**The *Mahā-sūtra* says: "Ajāta means not born; śatru means enemy." Because Buddha-nature is not born, the enemy of afflictions is born; because the enemy of afflictions is born, one does not see Buddha-nature; when afflictions are not born, one sees Buddha-nature. Further: Ajāta means not born; śatru means worldly dharmas. Because he is not defiled by the eight worldly dharmas, therefore he is named Ajātaśatru - this is the fundamental meaning.**

**The *Puchao Sutra* says: "Ajātaśatru repented with Mañjuśrī and attained pliant patience. At death he entered the Binṭāra hell; he immediately entered and immediately emerged. He was born in the Buddha-land above and attained non-arising patience. When Maitreya emerges, he will again come to this realm, named the Unmoving Bodhisattva, and later will become Buddha, titled the Tathāgata of the Pure Realm." Since his trace is already like this, how could his fundamental be measured? When the *Lotus* is expounded he is included among the pure assembly; when the *Nirvāṇa* is expounded he is drawn in as one of the reverse-offenders. How is this different from Kāśyapa receiving prediction in the *Lotus* yet being unable to bear the entrustment in the *Nirvāṇa*? One must not be deluded by the trace and thereby doubt the fundamental.**

---

**觀解者，貪愛母、無明父，害此故稱逆，逆即順也，行於非道，通達佛道。**

**In terms of contemplation and understanding: craving is the mother and ignorance is the father. Because one harms this, one is called "reverse" (rebellious). Yet reverse is precisely compliant: one "practices the non-path" and thereby penetrates the Buddha-path.**

#### Question and Answer

**問：**

**Question:**

**佛在人中說法，列人眾何少？**

**The Buddha teaches Dharma among humans. Why does the text list so few among the human assembly?**

**答：**

**Answer:**

**文略不載，人實不少，文云：「及諸小王、轉輪聖王等。」《無量義》中列四輪王，國王、國臣，國民、士女，其眾則廣。**

**The text is brief and does not record them in detail; in reality, the humans are not few. The text says: "and the minor kings, wheel-turning sage kings, and so on." The *Infinite Meaning* lists the four wheel-kings, as well as kings, ministers, citizens, and men and women; that assembly is broad.**

---

**問：**

**Question:**

**天、人、龍、鬼皆見佛聞法，地獄一道，無色一界，何意不列？**

**Devas, humans, dragons, and ghosts all see the Buddha and hear the Dharma. Why, then, are the one destiny of hell and the one realm of the formless not listed?**

**答：**

**Answer:**

**此義今當辯。夫諸道升沈，由戒有持、毀；見佛、不見佛，由乘有緩、急。然持戒有麁細，故報有優、劣；持乘有小、大，見佛有權、實，且略判戒乘各為三品，依《涅槃》一句開為四句釋之，其義則顯：一、戒乘俱急，二、戒緩乘急，三、戒急乘緩，四、戒乘俱緩。若通論戒乘，一切善法，一切觀慧，皆得稱戒，亦皆是乘，人天五乘即是其義，道、共等戒悉是通意也。今就別判，三歸、五戒、十善、八齋、出家律儀，乃至定共、能防身口、遮惡道果、得人天報者，名之為戒。若聞經生解，觀智推尋四諦、十二緣、六度、生滅無生滅等，智能破煩惱，運出三界者，名之為乘。故《大品》云：「有相之善不動、不出，無相之善能動、能出。」即此義也。若戒乘俱急者，持下品戒，戒急報在人中，持小乘乘急，以人中身，於三藏教時見佛聞法；持中乘乘急，以人報身，於通教大乘乃至帶方便諸大乘經時，見佛聞法；持上乘乘急，以人報身於華嚴、法華等教及諸教中圓，見佛聞法，預列為同聞眾者是也。若持中品戒急，報在欲界天，持小乘乘急，以欲界天身，於三藏時見佛聞法，餘如上說。若持上品戒急，加修禪定報在色、無色天等，持小乘乘急，以色、無色天身，於三藏中見佛聞法，餘如上說。釋第一句竟。若戒緩乘急者，三品戒皆緩，報墮三途，持小乘乘急，以三途身，於三藏中見佛聞法，餘如上說。釋第二句竟。若戒急乘緩者，三戒急故，受欲界人天及色、無色天身，三乘緩故，佛雖出世說三乘法，愛著樂報耽荒五欲，不見佛、不聞法，舍衛三億家，及諸不見聞者，三界著樂諸天等是也。釋第三句竟。若戒乘俱緩者，受三途報，不見佛、不聞法也，釋第四句竟。此文不列地獄者，以其戒緩，苦重報隔；上乘又緩，不能於法華見佛聞法，餘經有列者，餘乘急耳。又不列無色天者，上戒急故受天身著定味，上乘緩故，不能於法華見佛聞法；餘經有列者，有餘乘急耳。若得此意，一一勘天龍八部，皆識本緣緩急，來、不來義悉可解，廣釋如《淨名疏》。又識權者引實，本迹義轉明，將此勘已觀行，三世因果朗然可識。**

**This meaning should now be distinguished. The rising and sinking of the destinies depends on whether precepts are upheld or violated; seeing the Buddha or not seeing the Buddha depends on whether the vehicle is slow or swift. Upholding precepts has coarse and fine, therefore the recompense is superior or inferior; upholding the vehicle has small and great, therefore seeing the Buddha has provisional and real. Briefly judging both precepts and vehicle each as three grades, and by one line from the *Nirvāṇa* unfolding them into four statements, the meaning becomes clear: (1) both precepts and vehicle are swift; (2) precepts are lax and vehicle is swift; (3) precepts are swift and vehicle is lax; (4) both precepts and vehicle are lax.**
*[Critical apparatus: [3] 以下斷缺【甲】]*


**If one speaks broadly of precepts and vehicle: all wholesome dharmas and all contemplative wisdom may be called precepts, and all are also vehicles. The five vehicles of humans and devas are precisely this meaning; the precepts such as the path-precepts and shared-precepts are all the Shared intent. Now, in a distinct classification: taking refuge in the Three Jewels, the five precepts, ten wholesomes, eight fast-days, monastic discipline, up to the dhyāna-shared precepts - those that can guard body and speech, block the fruits of evil destinies, and attain human and deva recompense are called precepts. If, hearing sutras, understanding is born, and contemplative wisdom investigates the Four Truths, Twelve Links, Six Perfections, arising-and-ceasing and non-arising-and-ceasing, and so on, such that wisdom can break afflictions and carry one out of the three realms, that is called vehicle. Therefore the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā* says: "Wholesome with characteristics cannot move and cannot depart; wholesome without characteristics can move and can depart." This is precisely the meaning here.**

**If both precepts and vehicle are swift: upholding lower-grade precepts, swift precepts yield human rebirth; upholding the swift small-vehicle, with a human body, one sees the Buddha and hears the Dharma in the Tripiṭaka Teaching time. Upholding the swift middle vehicle, with a human recompense body, in the Shared Teaching Great Vehicle up to the Great Vehicle sutras with expedient means, one sees the Buddha and hears the Dharma. Upholding the swift upper vehicle, with a human recompense body, in the Avataṃsaka, Lotus, and other teachings that are perfect within other teachings, one sees the Buddha and hears the Dharma and is listed among those who hear together.**

**If one upholds swift middle-grade precepts, the recompense is in the desire-realm heavens. Upholding the swift small-vehicle, with a desire-realm deva body, one sees the Buddha and hears the Dharma in the Tripiṭaka time; the rest is as above. If one upholds swift upper-grade precepts, adding cultivation of dhyāna, the recompense is in the form and formless heavens. Upholding the swift small-vehicle, with a form/mless deva body, one sees the Buddha and hears the Dharma in the Tripiṭaka; the rest is as above. This completes the first statement.**

**If precepts are lax and vehicle is swift: all three grades of precepts are lax and the recompense falls into the three evil paths. Upholding the swift small-vehicle, with a three-evil-path body, one sees the Buddha and hears the Dharma in the Tripiṭaka; the rest is as above. This completes the second statement.**

**If precepts are swift and vehicle is lax: because the three precepts are swift, one receives bodies of desire-realm humans and devas as well as form/mless deva bodies. Because the three vehicles are lax, though the Buddha appears in the world and teaches the three vehicles, [one] clings to pleasurable recompense and is dissipated by the five desires, not seeing the Buddha and not hearing the Dharma - such as the three hundred million households of Śrāvastī and others who do not see and hear, and the devas of the three realms attached to pleasures, and so on. This completes the third statement.**

**If both precepts and vehicle are lax: one receives the three-evil-path recompense and does not see the Buddha and does not hear the Dharma. This completes the fourth statement.**

**That this text does not list hell is because precepts are lax, the suffering is heavy, and the recompense is cut off; and the upper vehicle is also lax, so [they] cannot see the Buddha and hear the Dharma in the *Lotus*. If other sutras list them, it is because other vehicles are swift. And that it does not list the formless heavens is because upper precepts are swift so one receives a deva body attached to the flavor of concentration, but the upper vehicle is lax so one cannot see the Buddha and hear the Dharma in the *Lotus*. If other sutras list them, there are other vehicles that are swift.**

**If one grasps this meaning, then investigating each member of the devas, dragons, and eight classes, all will recognize whether their fundamental conditions are slow or swift, and the meaning of coming or not coming can all be understood. For a full explanation see the *Vimalakīrti Commentary*. Also, recognizing provisional as leading to real, the meaning of Fundamental/Trace becomes even clearer. Once one uses this to examine contemplation-and-practice, the causes and fruits of the three times can be clearly known.**

## 12. THE DISTINCT SEQUENCE (別序)

**「爾時世尊」下，訖品，名別序。文為五：一、眾集，二、現瑞，三、疑念，四、發問，五、答問。光宅逆順生起，由眾集故現瑞，乃至由問故答，答由於問，乃至瑞由眾集，此乃翻覆緣起，鉤鎖相連，序於正意，竟自未顯，直是因緣一釋，尚自不明，況二三四緣，了無趣向。今明五序，序正中四一，集眾敘人一，現瑞敘理一，疑念敘行一，問答敘教一，此則因緣釋也。約教者，此序序正，非三藏，非通、非別，乃是序於圓正耳。約本迹者，若以序序〈壽量〉中本地四一者，此義自可知，不復記。觀心可解(云云)。就眾集又二，初眾集威儀，次眾集供養，《法華論》目此為威儀如法住。**

**From below the words "At that time the World-Honored One..." up to the end of the chapter is called the Distinct Sequence. The text has five parts: (1) the assembly gathering; (2) the manifestation of omens; (3) doubt and pondering; (4) raising the question; (5) answering the question.**
*[Critical apparatus: [4] 法華文句卷第三首，卷首題下無天台智者大師說七字【甲】]*


**Guangzhai's reverse-and-forward arising says: because the assembly gathers there are omens, up to because there is a question there is an answer; the answer depends on the question, up to the omens depend on the assembly gathering. This overturns conditioned arising, linking hook-to-link; yet the sequence toward the main intent is ultimately not revealed. It is merely one interpretation by causal conditions - it is not even clear there, much less in the second, third, and fourth kinds of conditions; there is no direction.**

**Now we clarify the five sequences: within the sequence toward the main meaning there are four "ones"; gathering the assembly narrates the people as one; the manifest omens narrate principle as one; doubt and pondering narrate practice as one; and question-and-answer narrate teaching as one. This is the interpretation by causal conditions. In terms of the teachings: this sequence sequences the main; it is not the Tripiṭaka, not the Shared, and not the Distinct - it is only a sequence toward the Perfect main.**

**In terms of Fundamental/Trace: if, by using sequence to sequence the "Life Span" chapter's fundamental ground four ones, this meaning can be known of itself and need not be recorded. Contemplating the mind can be understood (and so on).**

**Within the assembly gathering there are again two: first, the assembly's dignified deportment; second, the assembly's offerings. The *Lotus Treatise* calls this "dignified deportment abiding according to the Dharma."**

---

**「四眾」者，舊云：「出家、在家各二，合為四眾。」此名局，意不周。今約一眾，更開為四：謂發起眾、當機眾、影響眾、結緣眾。發起者，權謀智鑒，知機、知時，擊揚發動，成辦利益，如大象躄樹使象子得飽，所謂發起令集，發起瑞相，乃至發起問答等，皆名發起眾。當機者，宿植德本，緣合時熟，如癰欲潰，不起于座，聞即得道，此名當機眾。影嚮者，古往諸佛、法身菩薩，隱其圓極，匡輔法王，如眾星繞月，雖無為作而有巨益，此名影嚮眾。結緣者，力無引導擊動之能，德非伏物鎮嚴之用，而過去根淺，覆漏污雜，三慧不生，現世雖見佛、聞法，無四悉檀益，但作未來得度因緣，此名結緣眾。比丘眾既爾，餘三眾亦然，合十六眾。類如大通智勝佛時，王子覆講即彼時發起眾，聞法得道即彼時當機眾，聞法未度而世世相值，于今有住聲聞地者，即彼時結緣眾。彼佛世時尚有四四十六眾，今佛道同，寧得無耶？此是圓教十六眾，約三教亦例可知。**

**As for the "four assemblies": the old [interpretation] said: "Those who have left home and those who remain at home each have two; together they make the four assemblies." This name is narrow and the intent is not comprehensive. Now, taking it as one assembly and further opening it as four, they are: the initiating assembly, the responsive assembly, the shadow-and-influence assembly, and the karmic-connection assembly.**
*[Critical apparatus: [5] 合【大】，各合【甲】; [6] 集【大】，眾集【甲】; [7] 古往【大】，往古【甲】]*


**Initiating: having strategic wisdom and discerning insight, knowing capacities and knowing time, striking and raising and stirring, accomplishing benefits - like a great elephant shaking a tree so that the elephant-calf is fed. That is, initiating the gathering, initiating omens, up to initiating question-and-answer and so on - all are called the initiating assembly.**

**Responsive: in the past they planted roots of virtue; when conditions combine and the time is ripe, like an abscess about to rupture - without rising from the seat, hearing they immediately attain the path. This is called the responsive assembly.**

**Shadow-and-influence: Buddhas of the ancient past and Dharma-body bodhisattvas hide their perfect ultimate and support the Dharma King, like the many stars circling the moon. Though they act with no deliberate doing, there is great benefit - this is called the shadow-and-influence assembly.**

**Karmic-connection: lacking the power to guide and strike and stir, and lacking the virtue and function to subdue and solemnly stabilize others; because past roots are shallow and their vessel leaks and is impure and mixed, the three wisdoms do not arise. Although in the present life they may see the Buddha and hear the Dharma, there is no benefit of the Four Siddhāntas - they only become causes and conditions for future liberation. This is called the karmic-connection assembly.**

**Since the bhikṣu assembly is like this, the other three assemblies are also so; together they make sixteen assemblies. It is like at the time of the Great-Universal-Wisdom-Excellence Buddha: the royal sons who "covered and lectured" were the initiating assembly; those who heard the Dharma and attained the path were the responsive assembly; those who heard the Dharma but were not yet saved, and life after life met again so that up to the present there are those dwelling on the śrāvaka ground - these were the karmic-connection assembly. In that Buddha's world at that time there were still four times four, namely sixteen assemblies - now the Buddha-path is the same; how could there not be? This is the Perfect Teaching's sixteen assemblies. By analogy, in the three teachings it can also be known.**

**本迹可解。**

**Fundamental/Trace can be understood.**

---

**觀心者，研境作觀，在名字觀行位中，即成結緣眾，入相似位即成當機眾，入分真位即成發起、影嚮眾(云云)。**

**In terms of contemplating the mind: investigating the objects and making contemplation - within the levels of "name" and "contemplation-practice," one becomes the karmic-connection assembly. Entering the level of resemblance, one becomes the responsive assembly. Entering the level of partial truth, one becomes the initiating and shadow-and-influence assemblies (and so on).**

---

**「圍遶」者，佛初出世，人未知法，淨居天下化為人像，到已右旋，旋已敬禮，禮已却坐聽法。因於天敬，人以為楷，此因緣解也。圍遶者，行旋威儀也，表四門機動，俱見圓理，以圓對偏，例有四義，即教門解也。又佛身周匝相好莊嚴，四旋瞻仰，增念佛定，即觀心解也。若觀佛色身，得見法身，即本迹解。**

**As for "circumambulating": when the Buddha first appeared in the world, people did not yet know the Dharma. The Pure-Abodes heavens transformed into human forms; after arriving they circumambulated to the right; after circling they paid respect; after paying respect they withdrew and sat to hear the Dharma. Because of the deva reverence, humans took it as a model - this is the interpretation by causal conditions.**

**Circumambulating is the deportment of walking in circles. It signifies that the capacities of the four gates are stirred, all seeing the perfect principle. By matching perfect against partial, there are four meanings by analogy - this is the teaching-gate interpretation. Further: the Buddha-body is adorned with marks and excellences all around. By circling and gazing four times, one increases the samādhi of mindfulness of the Buddha - this is the contemplating-the-mind interpretation. If one contemplates the Buddha's form-body and attains seeing the Dharma-body, this is the Fundamental/Trace interpretation.**

---

**「供養」者，通三業皆是供養，別論卑謹虔禮名恭敬，至念專注名尊重，發言稱美名讚歎，施其依報名供養。此中文略，具辯應如《無量義經》廣說。天厨、天香、天鉢器等即是供養。大莊嚴菩薩及八萬大士，合掌叉手即是恭敬，一心瞻仰即是尊重，說七言偈即是讚歎。今論眾集，指彼文者，彼經眾集，說法竟，儼然不散，即彼座席仍說《法華》，故知三業供養不得有異，用彼廣釋，此略，於義無咎。**

**As for "making offerings": in general, the three karmas are all offerings. Specifically: humble and careful reverent bowing is called respect; focused attention in thought is called veneration; speaking and praising is called extolling; giving its dependent retribution is called making offerings. The text here is brief; a full explanation should be as in the *Infinite Meaning Sutra*. Heavenly food, heavenly fragrance, heavenly bowls and vessels, and so on are offerings. Great-Adornment Bodhisattva and the eighty thousand great beings: joining palms and placing hands together is respect; with one mind gazing up is veneration; speaking seven-syllable verses is extolling.**

**Now, in discussing the assembly gathering, it points to that text because in that sutra the assembly gathers and, after the Dharma is finished being taught, they remain solemn and do not disperse; and in that very seat it continues by preaching the *Lotus*. Therefore we know the three-karmas offerings cannot differ. Using that sutra's broad explanation and this one's brevity, there is no fault in meaning.**

## 13. THE MANIFESTATION SEQUENCE (現相序)

**從「為諸菩薩說大乘經」下，訖「以佛舍利起七寶塔」，是現相序。瑤師明七瑞，此土開六，他土總一；光宅此彼各六瑞。此六者，動則說法度人，靜則入定觀理，動靜為一雙；上天雨四花，下地六種動，上下為一雙；大眾內懷歡喜，如來外放光明，內外為一雙。今謂尋文起盡如光宅，若取名義便易，表報之意並自未彰。今明智定、因果、感應為三雙：智則指一說多，定則諦緣義處；因則四位天花，果則六處地動；感則大乘機發，應則圓毫照之。此六皆稱瑞相者，文云：「今相如本瑞」，瑞秖是相耳，人情分別，以密報為瑞，奇異為相。相何所報？妙理玄賾說之至難，人情悠悠不能尊重，先以異相駭變常情，常情既變而生欽渴，故以異釋相，以報釋瑞。略明六瑞，表報十妙，感應妙中已說，今更道說法瑞，表報說法妙、智妙；入定瑞，表報行妙；雨花瑞，表報位妙；地動瑞，表報境妙、乘妙；眾喜瑞，表報眷屬妙、利益妙；放光瑞，表報感應妙、神通妙，是故六種俱名現相序。**

**From the words "expounded the Great Vehicle Sutra for the sake of all bodhisattvas" down to "using the Buddha's relics to raise a seven-jeweled stupa" is the Manifestation Sequence. Master Yao explains seven omens: in this land six are opened, and in that land they are combined as one. Guangzhai says there are six omens here and six there.**
*[Critical apparatus: [1] 並【大】，普【甲】; [2] 秖【大】下同，只【甲】下同]*


**As for these six: in movement there is expounding Dharma and ferrying people across; in stillness there is entering samādhi and contemplating principle - movement and stillness form one pair. Above, heaven rains four flowers; below, the earth moves in six ways - above and below form one pair. The great assembly internally harbors joy; the Tathāgata externally emits light - internal and external form one pair.**

**Now [Zhiyi] says: if we follow the text's rise and end, it is as Guangzhai has it. But if one merely takes names and meanings, it is easy, while the intent of what is signified and what is reported is not yet made manifest. Now we clarify three pairs as wisdom/samādhi, cause/fruit, and stimulus/response: wisdom points from one to many in expounding; samādhi is the meaning-place of truth and conditions. Cause is the four stages signified by the heavenly flowers; fruit is the six locations signified by the earth shaking. Stimulus is the arousal of the Mahāyāna capacity; response is the illumination from the white curl between the brows.**

**That these six are all called auspicious signs is because the text says, \"The present signs are like the former signs.\" \"Auspicious\" is only \"sign\" - human feeling discriminates, taking hidden reporting as \"auspicious\" and the strange and unusual as \"sign.\" What do the signs report? The subtle principle is profound and hard to speak; human minds are dull and cannot revere it. First, therefore, unusual signs startle and transform the ordinary mind; when the ordinary mind is transformed, reverence and thirst arise. Thus, one uses the unusual to explain \"sign\" and uses reporting to explain \"auspicious.\"**

**Briefly clarifying the six signs: they signify and report the Ten Wondrous. In the \"Wondrous of Stimulus-and-Response\" it has already been explained; now we further speak of the Omen of Expounding Dharma, signifying and reporting the Wondrous of Expounding Dharma and the Wondrous of Wisdom. The Omen of Entering Samādhi signifies and reports the Wondrous of Practice. The Omen of Raining Flowers signifies and reports the Wondrous of Position. The Omen of Earth Shaking signifies and reports the Wondrous of Objects and the Wondrous of Vehicle. The Omen of the Assembly's Joy signifies and reports the Wondrous of Retinue and the Wondrous of Benefit. The Omen of Emitting Light signifies and reports the Wondrous of Stimulus-and-Response and the Wondrous of Supernormal Powers. Therefore, all six together are called the Manifestation Sequence.**

### [OMEN 1: EXPOUNDING THE GREAT VEHICLE SUTRA] (說大乘經瑞)

**「說大乘經」者，《善戒經》有七大：一、法大，謂十二部毘佛略也；二、心大，謂求於菩提也；三、解大，謂解菩薩藏也；四、淨大，謂見道淨心(云云)；五、莊嚴大，謂福德智慧也；六、時大，謂三僧祇行行也；七、具足大，謂以相好自嚴得菩提也。六是因大，七是果大，大因大果，合為大乘經也。今將十妙義捒經應可解。**

**As for \"Expounding a Great Vehicle Sutra\": the *Ś善戒經* speaks of Seven \"Greats\" (*Qī Dà*): (1) Great in Dharma - namely, the Twelve Divisions and the Vaipulya; (2) Great in mind - seeking bodhi; (3) Great in understanding - understanding the Bodhisattva Treasury; (4) Great in purity - the purified mind that sees the Path (and so on); (5) Great in adornment - merit and wisdom; (6) Great in time - practicing through three asaṃkhyeya kalpas; (7) Great in completeness - adorning oneself with marks and excellences and attaining bodhi. The first six are Great Causes; the seventh is Great Fruit. Great cause and great fruit together constitute a Great Vehicle Sutra. Now, by taking the meaning of the Ten Wondrous as a \"comb\" for this sutra, it should be understandable.**[^5]

[^5]: **\"Seven Greats\" (七大) in the *善戒經*:** Zhiyi cites this Mahāyāna rubric to gloss \"Great Vehicle Sutra\". The term `毘佛略` (*pífóluè*) is an older transliteration for *vaipulya* (\"extensive\"), tied to the \"twelve divisions\" (十二部) classification of Buddhist scripture. \"Three asaṃkhyeya\" (三僧祇) refers to the long bodhisattva-cultivation timescale.

**生師云：「無相空理，大乘之本，封三來久，頓說無三，不能取信，故說無相為《法華》序。」觀師意同。若爾，《般若》、《淨名》皆應是序，何獨《無量義》耶？彼釋云：「如此由五時故後教得起。」更問：「若爾，《無量義》與諸經皆通途相生，非關別序。」基師云：「空理無形故云無量，序意同前，難亦如是。」印師云：「無相善有成佛義，故言無量。」又云：「彼經不說有三、無三有異，《大品》非《法華》所指，指者不來秦地。」今謂此經是宋元嘉三年慧表比丘，於南海郡朝廷寺，遇曇摩耶舍受此本，還武當山，永明三年始傳於世。經既已來，豈可送還天竺？光宅云：「《無量義》以萬善同歸能成佛道，《法華》正明無二、無三，破三與一為異，故即為序。」若言萬善同歸，二三何不同歸？二三若歸，序正不異；若言破二、破三，何不破萬？破二、破三，則無二無三，既其破萬，是則無序。取經互舉意為異者，不成異也，異意不顯，序義亦不成也。劉虬注云：「無相為本，無相一法含義不貲。」若含義不貲，即是有相，何謂無相？尋諸師各偏一種，若言有相之善有成佛義，此三藏意耳；若言無相之善有成佛義，此通教意耳；若言含法不貲，此別教意耳。並他經所明，皆非序《法華》意耳。若《法華論》列十七種，皆《法華》之異名，無量義者，即《法華》之一名也。今申論意，佛直說此名而入此定，故得為序。《大品》、《金光明》、《涅槃》，皆先唱名，於序無妨。今經文殊引古佛，亦名無量義；又云：「當說大乘經名妙法蓮華」，此亦序中唱名，與論意同也。今按彼經釋無量義者從一法生，其一法者所謂無相，無相、不相名為實相，從此實相生無量法，所謂二法、三道、四果。今釋此文，無相者，無生死相也；不相者，不涅槃相也；涅槃亦無，故言不相無相，指中道為實相也。二法即頓、漸，頓謂《華嚴》頓中一切法也，漸謂三藏、方等、般若一切法也。三道即三乘，四果即羅漢、支佛、菩薩、佛，此等諸法名為無量。實相為義處，從一義處出無量法，得為無量法入一義處作序。譬如算師，從一算下諸算，除諸算歸一算，由下故除，下為除序。從一派諸，收諸歸一，開為合序，亦復如是。如此消釋，不違彼經論，亦與此經合(云云)。**

**Master Sheng says: \"The markless empty principle is the root of the Great Vehicle. The sealing of the Three has been long; if one suddenly says \"no three,\" people cannot accept it. Therefore one speaks marklessness as the *Lotus* preface.\" Master Guan's intent is the same. If so, then the Prajñā sutras and the *Vimalakīrti* should all be prefaces; why only the *Infinite Meaning*? Their explanation says: \"Because of the Five Periods, later teachings can arise.\" We further ask: if so, then *Infinite Meaning* and the other sutras all mutually generate one another along the common road; that has nothing to do with a distinct preface.**[^6]
*[Critical apparatus: [4] 宋【大】，宗【甲】; [5] 與【大】，與歸【甲】; [6] 若【大】，善【甲】; [7] 序正【大】，正序【甲】; [8] 耳【大】，也【甲】; [9] 無【大】，出無【甲】; [10] 佛【大】，佛也【甲】; [1] 亦【大】，〔－〕【甲】]*

*[Critical apparatus: [3] 僧【大】，阿僧【甲】]*


**Master Ji says: \"Because the empty principle has no form, it is called 'infinite'; the intent of 'preface' is the same as before; the difficulty is also like that.\" Master Yin says: \"Because markless good has the meaning of becoming Buddha, it is called 'infinite'.\" He also says: \"That sutra does not speak of a difference between 'having three' and 'no three'. The *Great Prajñā* is not what the *Lotus* points to; what it points to did not come to the Qin land.\" Now we say: this sutra was [transmitted] by the bhikṣu Huibiao in the third year of Yuanjia (Song); in the Court Monastery of Nanhai Commandery he met Dharmayaśas and received this copy; returning to Mount Wudang, it was first circulated in the third year of Yongming. Since the sutra has already arrived, how could one \"send it back\" to India?**

**Master Guangzhai says: \"The *Infinite Meaning*, by having the ten-thousand goods converge to one, can accomplish the Buddha-way. The *Lotus* precisely clarifies 'no two' and 'no three', breaking the difference between three and one; therefore it is the preface.\" If one says the ten-thousand goods converge to one, why would two and three not also converge? If two and three converge, then preface and main are not different. If one says it breaks two and breaks three, why does it not break the ten-thousand? If one breaks two and breaks three, then there is no two and no three. If one then breaks the ten-thousand, there is no preface. To take sutras \"mutually citing one another\" as establishing difference does not establish difference: the intent of difference is not made manifest, and the preface-meaning is also not established.**

**Liu Qiu's annotation says: \"Marklessness is the basis; the single markless dharma contains meanings without measure.\" If it \"contains meanings without measure,\" that is precisely characteristic - how can it be \"markless\"? Examining the various masters, each leans to one side: if one says that characteristic good has the meaning of becoming Buddha, that is the Tripiṭaka intent; if one says that markless good has the meaning of becoming Buddha, that is the Shared Teaching intent; if one says \"containing dharmas without measure,\" that is the Distinct Teaching intent. All are what other sutras explain; none is the intent of serving as the preface to the *Lotus*.**

**If the *Lotus Treatise* lists seventeen kinds, they are all alternate names of the *Lotus*. \"Infinite Meanings\" is one name of the *Lotus*. Now, explicating the Treatise's intent: the Buddha directly spoke this name and entered this samādhi; therefore it can serve as the preface. The *Great Prajñā*, *Golden Light*, and *Nirvāṇa* all first announce the name; that does not obstruct their prefaces. In the present sutra, Manjuśrī cites ancient Buddhas and also names \"Infinite Meanings\"; it also says, \"I will expound a Great Vehicle Sutra named *The Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower*.\" This too is announcing the name within the preface, matching the Treatise's intent.**

**Now, according to that sutra: \"Infinite Meanings\" are explained as arising from one dharma. That one dharma is what is called marklessness. Marklessness and non-mark are named the Real Aspect. From this Real Aspect arise infinite dharmas - namely, the Two Dharmas, the Three Paths, and the Four Fruits. Interpreting this passage: \"marklessness\" means no mark of saṃsāra; \"non-mark\" means no mark of nirvāṇa. Nirvāṇa too is absent; therefore it says \"non-mark and marklessness,\" pointing to the Middle Way as the Real Aspect.**

**The Two Dharmas are Sudden and Gradual. Sudden refers to all dharmas within the Sudden teaching of the *Avataṃsaka*; Gradual refers to all dharmas of the Tripiṭaka, Vaipulya, and Prajñā. The Three Paths are the Three Vehicles. The Four Fruits are Arhat, Pratyekabuddha, Bodhisattva, and Buddha. These dharmas are named \"infinite.\" The Real Aspect is the Meaning-Place: from one Meaning-Place arise infinite dharmas; thus \"infinite dharmas entering one Meaning-Place\" can serve as the preface. It is like a calculator: from one computation it produces the other computations; by subtracting, it returns the other computations to one computation - because it goes downward, there is subtraction, and the downward is the preface of subtraction. From one, it distributes many; it gathers many and returns to one; the opening is the preface of the closing. It is likewise. Interpreting it like this does not contradict that sutra and its Treatise, and it accords with this sutra too (and so on).**

[^6]: **Texts and frameworks in CBETA 002:516:** `《般若》` = Prajñā corpus; `《淨名》` = *Vimalakīrti-nirdeśa*; `《無量義》` = *Infinite Meaning Sutra*; `五時` = Tiantai \"Five Periods\" periodization; `《法華論》` = *Lotus Treatise* (attributed to Vasubandhu); `《大品》` = *Mahāprajñāpāramitā* (Great Prajñā); `《金光明》` = *Golden Light Sutra*; `《涅槃》` = *Mahāparinirvāṇa*; `《華嚴》` = *Avataṃsaka*.

**復次《無量義》讚偈，明法身百非洞遣，應為丈六紫金輝。《普賢觀》明常樂我淨四波羅蜜住處。前後兩文皆明常，豈有中間壽量而是無常耶？他難云：「序已說常，正何所道？」今反難之，《涅槃》以純陀是序，已開常宗，正何所道？他又例《淨名》序金剛無為無數，而正說不明常，《法華》亦應爾。今還反難之，純陀序常，《涅槃》正應無常，今論序常，正常何疑也？**

**Furthermore: the praise-verses in the *Infinite Meaning* clarify the dharmakāya by exhaustively negating the hundred \"nots\"; its response-body should be the sixteen-foot purple-gold radiance. The *Samantabhadra Contemplation* clarifies the \"abode\" of the four pāramitās of permanence, bliss, self, and purity. The two passages before and after both clarify \"permanence\"; how could the \"lifespan\" in the middle be impermanent? Someone objects: \"The preface has already spoken permanence; what does the main discourse speak?\" Now we object in turn: the *Nirvāṇa* takes Cunda as its preface and has already opened the doctrine of permanence; what does its main discourse speak? Someone again compares it to the *Vimalakīrti*: its preface speaks of countless vajra-like unconditioned dharmas, yet the main discourse does not clarify permanence; the *Lotus* should be the same. Now we object back: if Cunda is the preface of permanence, then the *Nirvāṇa*'s main discourse should be impermanent; but it is not. Since we are discussing the preface as permanence, why doubt the main discourse as permanence?**[^7]

[^7]: **Cunda and \"permanence\":** `純陀` (Cunda) appears in the *Mahāparinirvāṇa-sūtra* as a framing figure. Zhiyi uses the Nirvāṇa case as a strict parallel: a preface that \"opens\" permanence does not entail an \"impermanent\" main discourse. `《普賢觀》` here refers to the *Samantabhadra Contemplation Sutra*.

**「教菩薩法」者，無量義處用教菩薩也，義處即諦理也。下文：「普令一切眾，亦同得此道」又云：「若我遇眾生，盡教以佛道」即此意焉。**

**As for \"Teaching bodhisattvas\": the Meaning-Place of Infinite Meanings is used to teach bodhisattvas; the Meaning-Place is precisely the truth-principle. Below it says: \"Universally causing all beings to also attain this Way\"; and it also says: \"If I meet sentient beings, I will teach them all the Buddha-way\" - that is exactly this intent.**

---

**「佛所護念」者，無量義處是佛自所證得，是故如來之所護念。下文云：「佛自住大乘也，雖欲開示，眾生根鈍，久默斯要，不務速說。」故言護念。**

**As for \"That which the Buddha protects and keeps in mindfulness\": the Meaning-Place of Infinite Meanings is what the Buddha himself has realized; therefore it is what the Tathāgata protects and keeps in mindfulness. Below it says: \"The Buddha himself abides in the Great Vehicle. Although he wishes to open and reveal [it], sentient beings' faculties are dull; for a long time he kept this essential point silent, not hastening to speak.\" Therefore it says \"protected and kept in mindfulness.\"**

### [OMEN 2: ENTERING THE SAMĀDHI OF THE MEANING-PLACE] (入無量義處三昧瑞)

**「佛說經已，入無量義處三昧」者，慧定相成，非禪不智，須先入定，非智不禪，故先說法。即智而定，即定而智，先後入出，無有隔礙。疑者云：「若未說無量義可入斯定，說此經已何故入定？」釋言：「先入此定，後說此經，可解。說此經竟而更入者，是為《法華》作序耳。何者？若不先開，則後無所合，先入開定為合定作序，稱為瑞相，即此義焉。若作次第者，先入無量義三昧已，應入法華三昧，若明文彰顯時眾則知，何俟彌勒殷勤、文殊靳固，故知作序其義轉明。」**

**As for \"After the Buddha finished expounding the sutra, he entered the Samādhi of the Meaning-Place of Infinite Meanings\": wisdom and samādhi complete one another - without dhyāna there is no wisdom, so one must first enter samādhi; without wisdom there is no dhyāna, so one first expounds the Dharma. It is wisdom-as-samādhi and samādhi-as-wisdom; entering and emerging, earlier and later, there is no separation or obstruction.**

**A doubter says: \"If, before expounding *Infinite Meanings*, one could enter this samādhi, then after expounding this sutra why enter samādhi?\" The explanation says: \"If he first entered this samādhi and later expounded this sutra, it is understandable. That after finishing this sutra he enters again is to make the *Lotus*' preface. Why? If one does not open first, then later there is nothing to close. First entering the opening samādhi makes the preface for the closing samādhi; it is named an auspicious sign - this is the meaning.\"**

**If one takes it as a step-by-step sequence: having first entered the *Infinite Meaning* samādhi, one should then enter the *Lotus* samādhi. If the text were bright and manifest, the assembly would know - why would we need Maitreya's earnestness and Manjuśrī's holding back? Therefore we know that, as preface, the meaning becomes all the clearer.**

---

**「身心不動」者，與所緣之處相應也。身之本源湛若虛空，心之理性畢竟常寂，大通智勝身體及手足，寂然安不動，其心常憺怕，未曾有散亂。身若金剛不可動轉，心若虛空無有分別，無量義處三昧法持於身心故不動也。稱為無量者，此定寂而常，照能知世間，從此一法出無量法也。若作序義，身法體動運，今令不動運；心法體分別，今令不分別，序義明矣。**

**As for \"Body and mind unmoving\": it corresponds to and accords with the place that is taken as the object. The body's source is clear and deep like empty space; the mind's principle-nature is ultimately ever-quiescent. Great-Universal-Wisdom-Excellence's body and hands and feet rested in stillness and did not move; his mind was constantly calm and detached, never scattered. The body is like vajra and cannot be shifted; the mind is like empty space and has no discriminations. Because the Samādhi of the Meaning-Place of Infinite Meanings sustains body and mind, they do not move.**

**It is called \"infinite\" because this samādhi is quiescent yet constant; its illumination can know the world; from this one dharma arise infinite dharmas. If we take it as \"preface\" meaning: the essence of bodily dharmas is to move and turn - now it is made not to move and turn; the essence of mental dharmas is to discriminate - now it is made not to discriminate. The preface-meaning is thus clear.**

**問：**

**Question:**

---

**瑞相本論奇異，說法入定，佛之恒儀，何得為瑞？**

**Question: Auspicious signs are, in principle, a matter of the strange and extraordinary. Expounding the Dharma and entering samādhi are the Buddha's constant procedure; how can they be auspicious signs?**

---

**答：**

**Answer:**

---

**說法雖竟，時眾不散，肅有所待，故知前之說法，舉眾來集，待於後聞；此事奇特與常說異，何意非瑞？雖入開定，意在合定，與常入定有異，何意非瑞相耶？又文殊引古佛六瑞皆有此事，若昔非瑞相，何以證今？今古同然，豈可以凡情而非之耶？**

**Answer: Although the preaching is finished, the assembly does not disperse; solemnly, it has something it is waiting for. Therefore we know that the previous preaching gathered the assembly to come together, waiting for what they will hear afterward. This is strange and special, different from ordinary preaching - why is it not an auspicious sign? Although he enters the \"opening\" samādhi, his intent is in the \"closing\" samādhi; it differs from ordinary entering of samādhi - why is it not an auspicious sign? Moreover, Manjuśrī cites ancient Buddhas whose Six Omens all include this matter. If in the past it were not an auspicious sign, how could it certify the present? Past and present are the same; how could one use ordinary feelings to deny it?**

### [OMEN 3: RAINING FOUR FLOWERS] (雨花瑞)

**「天雨四花」者，舊云：「小、大白，小、大赤。」《正法華》云：「意花、大意花，浦嚮花、大浦嚮花。」《釋論》九十九云：「天花妙者，名曼陀羅。」又七十九云：「八百比丘成佛國土，常雨五色曼陀羅花。」舊雨小、大白，表在家二眾，小、大赤表出家二眾，表其昔來因而未果。今謂此解狹而不當，直論四眾，收三藏中十六眾尚不盡，況復四十八眾？是故為狹。夫花相密報其因，四眾昔來已是因，何俟花報？若報其果，天應雨實，何故雨花？故云不當。今言雨花，明其昔因非佛因，三藏中因是二乘因，通中因是共因，別中是菩薩因，皆非佛因。今天雨花，報其當獲佛因。佛因者，即四輪因也，小白表銅輪，習種性開佛知見也；大白表銀輪，性種性十行，示佛知見也；小赤表迦輪，道種性十迴向，悟佛知見也；大赤表琉璃輪，聖種性十地，入佛知見也。四輪皆同是因，是因由中而生，故從天而雨，由是因位故，以花表之。但因有趣果之義，故而散佛上。如此因果，誰當感剋？秖是此會時眾，故言「及諸大眾」也。下文殊釋疑，吹大法䗍等四句，又正說中開示悟入，又與大車中遊於四方，節節相承皆是位義，故知花表因位也。**

**As for \"Heaven rains four flowers\": the old explanation says, \"Small and great white; small and great red.\" The *Zhengfa-hua* says: \"Meaning-flower; Great-meaning-flower; Pǔxiàng-flower; Great-Pǔxiàng-flower.\" The *Treatise* (99) says: \"Heavenly flowers, when wondrous, are called māndārava.\" And again (79) says: \"Eight hundred bhikṣus become Buddhas in their lands, where five-colored māndārava flowers constantly rain.\" The old explanation takes the raining of small and great white to represent the two lay assemblies, and small and great red to represent the two renunciant assemblies, signifying their former causes but not yet their fruits.**
*[Critical apparatus: [3] 實【大】，寶【甲】; [4] 迦【大】，金【甲】]*


**Now we say: this explanation is narrow and improper. Even if one speaks only of the four assemblies, it still does not fully include the sixteen assemblies of the Tripiṭaka teaching - how much less the forty-eight assemblies? Therefore it is narrow. Moreover: the flower-appearance secretly reports its cause. Since the four assemblies have long already been causes, why wait for flowers to report it? If they report the fruit, heaven should rain \"real things\" - why rain flowers? Therefore it is improper.**

**Now we say that the raining of flowers clarifies that their former causes were not Buddha-causes. In the Tripiṭaka teaching, the cause is the two-vehicle cause; in the Shared teaching, the cause is the \"common\" cause; in the Distinct teaching, it is the bodhisattva cause - none are Buddha-causes. Now heaven rains flowers, reporting that they will obtain Buddha-causes. Buddha-causes are precisely the Four Wheel Causes: small white represents the copper wheel - the \"Habit-seed\" nature opening Buddha-knowledge-and-insight; great white represents the silver wheel - the \"Nature-seed\" nature of the Ten Practices, showing Buddha-knowledge-and-insight; small red represents the gold wheel - the \"Path-seed\" nature of the Ten Transferences, awakening to Buddha-knowledge-and-insight; great red represents the lapis wheel - the \"Sage-seed\" nature of the Ten Grounds, entering Buddha-knowledge-and-insight.**[^8]

**All four wheels are causes. Causes arise from the middle; therefore they rain from heaven. Because they are cause-positions, flowers symbolize them. Yet causes have the sense of \"tending toward fruit,\" therefore they scatter upon the Buddha. With causes and fruits like this, who is to \"stimulate\" and \"fulfill\" them? Precisely the assembly of this occasion; therefore it says \"and the great assembly.\" Below, Manjuśrī explains the doubt: the four phrases such as \"blowing the great Dharma conch,\" and also, in the main preaching, \"opening, showing, awakening, and entering\"; and also, traveling the four directions in the great cart - each step following the next is meaning of position. Therefore we know the flowers symbolize the cause-positions.**

[^8]: **Four Wheel Causes (四輪因) and the seed-natures:** Zhiyi maps the four flowers to a Tiantai position-schema (習種性 / 性種性 / 道種性 / 聖種性) and \"Four Wheels\" (copper/silver/gold/lapis). He ties them to the *Lotus* refrain \"open/indicate/awaken/enter\" Buddha-knowledge-and-insight, reading the flowers as omens of *positions* (位) rather than mere \"four assemblies\" symbolism. The cited texts include `《正法華》` and `《釋論》` (the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra*).

---

**問：**

**Question:**

---

**四輪是別位義，那得釋圓位耶？**

**Question: The Four Wheels are a \"Distinct Teaching\" position-meaning (別位義). How can they be used to interpret the Perfect positions?**

---

**答：**

**Answer:**

---

**名通義圓尚無所失，況名別義圓而不得用耶？**

**Answer: Even when the *name* is shared and the *meaning* is perfect, there is no fault. How much more, then, when the name is distinct and the meaning is perfect - how could it be unusable?**

---

**問：**

**Question:**

---

**別義賢聖，圓亦有耶？**

**Question: In the Distinct Teaching sense there are \"worthies\" and \"sages\" (賢聖). Does the Perfect Teaching also have them?**

---

**答：**

**Answer:**

---

**已如《玄義》，若言四花俱從天雨，表四眾當同成一因，如此釋者，出三藏義未出通義；若言四眾同是菩薩因者，此釋出通義，未出別義；並非佛因，皆非《法華》意也。《法華》意如前說。**

**Answer: This is already as in the *Profound Meaning* (*Xuányì*). If one says the four flowers all rain from heaven and symbolize that the four assemblies will together become one cause, this interpretation leaves the Tripiṭaka meaning and does not yet leave the Shared meaning. If one says the four assemblies are all bodhisattva causes, this leaves the Shared meaning but does not yet leave the Distinct meaning. Since both are not Buddha-causes, neither is the *Lotus* intent. The *Lotus* intent is as explained above.**[^9]

[^9]: **\"Xuányì\" (玄義):** Zhiyi's *Fahua Xuanyi* (Profound Meaning of the *Lotus Sūtra*), frequently cited as the doctrinal baseline for these interpretive disputes.

### [OMEN 4: EARTH SHAKING] (地動瑞)

**「普佛世界地六種動」者，舊云動三乘人因果決定六執者，此破三藏家三乘六執，未破通教三乘六執。通教約法，三人因果同，若約人，三人因果異，此之同異俱被破，而舊家破意不破此也。別教無三乘名則無六執，舊所不破。今明別家因時三法縱橫，果時三法亦縱橫，此則須破。今釋地六種動，表圓家六番破無明，無明磬礴未曾侵毀，方將破壞，故動地以表之，無明若轉即變為明，故普佛世界六種震動也。六種表住、行、向、地、等、妙六番也。《優婆塞清淨行經》云：「菩薩生時動地，示此生已盡無復煩惱，一切眾生應得道者，煩惱將滅故動。」即此義也。**

**As for the phrase "the entire Buddha-world's earth moves in six ways": the old explanation says it is the six fixed attachments of the three-vehicle people's cause-and-fruit. This breaks the Tripiṭaka school's three vehicles' six attachments, but does not break the Shared Teaching's three vehicles' six attachments. In the Shared Teaching, if one speaks in terms of dharmas, the three people's cause-and-fruit are the same; if one speaks in terms of persons, the three people's cause-and-fruit differ. Both this sameness and difference are broken, yet the old school's intent of breaking does not break this. In the Distinct Teaching, since there is no name of \"three vehicles,\" there are then no six attachments - which the old [explanation] does not break. Now we clarify that in the Distinct school, at the time of cause the three dharmas interweave horizontally and vertically, and at the time of fruit the three dharmas also interweave horizontally and vertically - this too must be broken.**
*[Critical apparatus: [5] 以【大】，〔－〕【甲】]*


**Now, in explaining the earth's six kinds of movement: it signifies the Perfect school's six rounds of breaking ignorance. Ignorance is vast and has never yet been violated; it is just about to be broken, therefore the earth is shaken to signify it. If ignorance turns, it then transforms into clarity; therefore the entire Buddha-world shakes in six ways. The six kinds signify the six rounds of Abodes, Practices, Transferences, Grounds, Equal Enlightenment, and Wondrous Enlightenment. The *Upāsaka Precepts (Pure Conduct) Sutra* says: \"When a bodhisattva is born, the earth moves, showing that once this birth has occurred, there are no further afflictions. For all sentient beings who should attain the Way, because their afflictions are about to cease, the earth moves.\" This is precisely that meaning.**

---

**本迹解者，如文殊釋疑，引古佛為答，密得此意即是識本，非謂他佛昔現斯瑞，而我世尊本亦斯瑞，非今一反也(云云)。**

**In the Fundamental/Trace interpretation: as in Manjuśrī's explanation resolving the doubt, he cites an ancient Buddha as the answer. Secretly obtaining this intent is precisely \"recognizing the Fundamental\". It is not that another Buddha formerly manifested these omens and that our World-Honored One's Fundamental is also *only* these same omens; it is not that now [the Buddha] \"turns back once\" (and so on).**

---

**觀行者，動六根也，地相堅固如六根水執，未曾入大乘之道，動難動之地，表淨未淨之根。東涌西沒者，東方青主肝，肝主眼；西方白主肺，肺主鼻，此表眼根功德生、鼻根煩惱互滅，鼻根功德生、眼中煩惱互滅，餘方涌沒表餘根生滅亦復如是。六動者，動、起、涌、震、吼、覺，一一中又有三：謂動、遍動、等遍動。直動為動，四天下動為遍動，大千動為等遍動。餘五亦如是，合十八種動，此即表淨十八界也(云云)。**

**In terms of contemplating practice, it is the moving of the six sense faculties. The earth-characteristic is firm and solid, like the six faculties' watery clinging. [Since one] has never entered the Great Vehicle's path, the \"hard-to-move\" earth is moved, signifying faculties that are pure-yet-not-pure.**
*[Critical apparatus: [1] 滅【大】，滅也【甲】]*


**As for \"east surges and west sinks\": the east is green and governs the liver; the liver governs the eye. The west is white and governs the lungs; the lungs govern the nose. This signifies that the eye-faculty's merit arises while the nose-faculty's afflictions mutually cease; and that the nose-faculty's merit arises while the eye's afflictions mutually cease. The surging and sinking of the remaining directions signifies that the arising and ceasing of the remaining faculties is likewise.**

**As for the six movements: shaking, rising, surging, quaking, roaring, and awakening. Within each there are again three: namely, movement, pervasive movement, and equal-pervasive movement. A direct movement is called \"movement\"; movement of the four continents is \"pervasive movement\"; movement of a great thousand-world is \"equal-pervasive movement.\" The other five are the same. Together, this makes eighteen kinds of movement; this signifies the purification of the eighteen realms (and so on).**

### [OMEN 5: AUDIENCE REJOICING] (眾喜瑞)

**次明大眾心喜瑞者，眾見雨花地動，知甘露將降欣躍內充，表大機當發感於勝應。**

**Next, explaining the omen of the great assembly's mind-joy: seeing the raining of flowers and the shaking of the earth, they know \"sweet dew\" is about to descend and rejoice and leap with inner fullness. This symbolizes that a great capacity is about to arouse stimulus toward a superior response.**

---

**問：**

**Question:**

---

**喜怒人之常情，何得為瑞？**

**Question: Joy and anger are ordinary human emotions. How can they be omens?**

---

**答：**

**Answer:**

---

**天花悅眼，地動震心，《大經》云：「動時能令眾生心動。」花地是外瑞，心喜是內瑞，非常之喜，昔雖曾有，而不為喜所動，而能一心觀佛，何得非瑞？若言歡喜動陰心者，人天義也；若喜動真諦無漏心者，藏通義也；若喜動即假心者，別義也；喜動實相心者，圓義也。**

**Answer: Heavenly flowers delight the eyes; earth-shaking shakes the mind. The *Mahā-sūtra* says: \"When it moves, it can cause sentient beings' minds to move.\" Flowers and earth are external omens; mind-joy is an internal omen. It is not ordinary joy. Though such joy has existed in the past, [one] was not moved by joy and yet could contemplate the Buddha with one mind - how could it not be an omen? If one says joy moves the defiled (skandha) mind, that is the human-and-heaven meaning. If joy moves the undefiled mind of the True Truth, that is the Tripiṭaka/Shared meaning. If joy moves the Provisional mind, that is the Distinct meaning. If joy moves the mind of the Real Aspect, that is the Perfect meaning.**[^14]

### [OMEN 6: EMITTING LIGHT] (放光瑞)

**次明佛放光瑞，即表應機設教，破惑除疑。白毫具種種功德，《觀佛海三昧經》云：「佛初生時，牽長五尺，苦行時長一丈四尺，得佛時長一丈五尺，其毫中表俱空，如白琉璃筒，內外清淨。從初發心，中間行行種種相貌，乃至入涅槃，一切功德皆現毫中。」毫在二眉之間，即表中道常也，其相柔軟表樂，卷舒自在表我，白即表淨，放光破闇表中道生智慧，光照此土、他土表自覺、覺他。**

**Next, explaining the omen of the Buddha emitting light: it signifies establishing teaching in response to capacities, breaking delusion and removing doubt. The white curl possesses various merits. The *Contemplation of the Buddha-Sea Samādhi Sutra* says: \"When the Buddha was first born, it was drawn out to be five *chǐ* long; when practicing asceticism it was one *zhàng* four *chǐ* long; when he attained Buddhahood it was one *zhàng* five *chǐ* long. Within the hair, inside and outside are both empty, like a white beryl tube, pure within and without. From the first arousing of the mind, through the various practices and various appearances in the middle, up to entering nirvāṇa, all merits are displayed within the hair.\" The curl is between the two eyebrows, symbolizing the Middle Way's permanence; its softness symbolizes bliss; its free rolling and unrolling symbolizes self; its whiteness symbolizes purity. Emitting light breaks darkness, symbolizing that from the Middle Way wisdom arises. The light illuminating this land and other lands symbolizes self-enlightenment and enlightening others.**[^15]
*[Critical apparatus: [6] 牽【大】，毫【甲】]*


[^15]: **Texts cited in CBETA 002:593:** `《觀佛海三昧經》` is cited for the \"white curl\" (白毫) imagery and its doctrinal reading. Measurements (尺/丈) are kept as given in the source.

---

**復次二乘雖達二諦不知中道，如有二眉而無白毫，別教雖知三諦，不能毫中具一切法，當知從初至後，法界中事悉現毫內者，即表圓教之意。**

**Furthermore: though the Two Vehicles reach the Two Truths, they do not know the Middle Way - like having two eyebrows but no white curl. Although the Distinct Teaching knows the Three Truths, it cannot have all dharmas contained within the curl. Know that \"from beginning to end, all matters in the dharma-realm appearing within the curl\" precisely signifies the intent of the Perfect Teaching.**

---

**復次，眾經明放光不同，《大品》從足下千輻輪相，乃至頂髻，一一各放六萬億光明，如彼廣說。《大經》面門放光，此經白毫放光，緣宜不同耳。又收光不同，《育王經》云：「收從背入，欲記過去事；收從前入，欲記未來事。」而不見記現在事，私謂脇入應記現在事也。足入記地獄，踝入記畜生，脚指入記鬼，膝入記人，左掌入記鐵輪王，右掌入記金輪王及記諸天，臍入記聲聞，口入記緣覺，白毫入記菩薩，肉髻入記佛。而今經放白毫光，而未見收光之文者，略耳。又解云，放光照現在事，收光明將來事，此經正論此土、他土諸佛道同，故正論放光。若解諸佛道同，即開示悟入，任運獲記則放光為正，收光是傍，故略而不說耳。若丈六佛放光者，三藏義也；若尊特佛與丈六佛共放光者，通義也；若尊特佛獨放光者，別義也；若丈六佛即毘盧遮那法身放光者，圓義也。舊云：「此土六瑞訖至膩吒天。」今尋文從照東方萬八千土下，即是他土六瑞之文，蓋斟酌由人耳。舊云：「實照十方，照東方者，表一乘因果是諸因果之上，萬是數圓表果位滿，八千數缺表因果未足，若照東方義已足，更照九方復何所表？」今明東是方始，表十住是位始，迹門說法，生身菩薩朗然見理，入於十住開佛知見。舉初即知中後，故云：「靡不周遍者」。當知諸方亦然，諸位亦然，若就本門說法，四方佛集即表本門說法，法身菩薩增道損生，四位增長也。**

**Furthermore: the sutras describe \"emitting light\" differently. In the *Great Prajñā*, it is from the thousand-spoked wheel-mark beneath the feet up to the topknot; each emits sixty thousand myriads of millions of rays, as explained there in detail. The *Mahā-sūtra* has light emitted from the face; this sutra has light emitted from the white curl; it is simply that conditions and suitability differ.**[^16]
*[Critical apparatus: [7] 緣宜【大】，宜緣【甲】; [8] 今【大】，此【甲】]*


**Moreover, the \"collecting\" of the light differs. The *Aśoka Sutra* says: \"If it is collected from the back and enters [the body], it is to predict past matters; if it is collected from the front and enters, it is to predict future matters.\" Yet it does not mention predicting present matters; privately, I say that entering from the side should predict present matters. \"Entering the feet\" predicts hell; the ankles predict animals; the toes predict ghosts; the knees predict humans; the left palm predicts the Iron Wheel King; the right palm predicts the Gold Wheel King and predicts the heavens; the navel predicts śrāvakas; the mouth predicts pratyekabuddhas; the white curl predicts bodhisattvas; the fleshy topknot predicts Buddhas.**

**Yet in this sutra, although the white-curl light is emitted, we do not see text on collecting the light; it is brief. Another explanation says: emitting light illuminates present matters; collecting light indicates future matters. This sutra is precisely discussing that, in This Land and That Land, the Way of the Buddhas is the same; therefore it focuses on emitting light. If one explains \"the Buddhas' way is the same,\" that is precisely \"opening, showing, awakening, and entering\"; obtaining predictions then happens spontaneously. Thus emitting light is primary and collecting light is secondary; therefore it is omitted and not discussed.**

**If a sixteen-foot Buddha emits light, that is the Tripiṭaka meaning. If a \"Specially Honored\" Buddha and a sixteen-foot Buddha emit light together, that is the Shared meaning. If only the Specially Honored Buddha emits light, that is the Distinct meaning. If the sixteen-foot Buddha is itself Vairocana's Dharma-body emitting light, that is the Perfect meaning. The old saying is: \"This land's six omens extend up to the Niṭa Heaven.\" Now, examining the text: from the phrase \"illuminating the east, eighteen thousand lands\" downward, it is the text of the other lands' six omens; such weighing and deciding is merely human.**[^16]

**The old also says: \"In fact it illuminates the ten directions; illuminating the east symbolizes that the One Vehicle's cause and fruit are above all causes and fruits. Ten-thousand is a round number symbolizing the fruition-position being complete; eight-thousand is an incomplete number symbolizing cause-and-fruit not yet complete. If the meaning of illuminating the east is already sufficient, what could illuminating the nine directions further symbolize?\" Now we clarify: the east is the beginning direction, symbolizing the Ten Abodes as the beginning positions. In the Trace Gate's preaching, embodied bodhisattvas clearly see the principle and enter the Ten Abodes, opening Buddha-knowledge-and-insight. By citing the first, one thereby knows the middle and later; therefore it says, \"there was nowhere not pervaded.\" One should know that the other directions are likewise, and the other positions likewise. If, in terms of the Fundamental Gate's preaching, the Buddhas gathering from the four directions symbolizes preaching in the Fundamental Gate; Dharma-body bodhisattvas increase the Way and decrease birth, and the four positions increase.**

[^16]: **Texts and doctrinal distinctions in CBETA 002:599:** `《大品》` = *Mahāprajñāpāramitā*; `《大經》` here = *Mahāparinirvāṇa*; `《育王經》` = *Aśoka Sutra*. Zhiyi distinguishes \"sixteen-foot\" (丈六) vs. \"specially honored\" (尊特) Buddhas and reads them as markers for the Four Teachings; he also critiques older attempts to localize the \"six omens\" to a fixed \"heavenly\" endpoint (膩吒天).

**觀解「萬八千」者，約十八界，論百法界、千性相，即有一萬八千，此等境界佛慧未開，今應當開，故以數表之耳。文云：「從阿鼻獄上至有頂」即六法界也。又見諸佛、菩薩、比丘等，十界具足，故文云：「靡不周遍」，即此意也。若分文屬此土第六相，若屬他土即是總相照他土文。**

**Interpreting \"eighteen thousand\": by the Eighteen Realms, and by discussing the Hundred Dharma-Realms and the Thousand Natures-and-Aspects, there are eighteen thousand. These realms are ones the Buddha-wisdom has not yet opened; now it should open them. Therefore the number symbolizes this. The text says: \"From Avīci hell up to the Peak of Existence\" - that is the Six Dharma-Realms. Further, seeing Buddhas, bodhisattvas, bhikṣus, and so on makes the Ten Realms complete; therefore the text says \"there was nowhere not pervaded\" - that is this meaning. If one assigns this passage, it belongs to This Land's sixth sign; if one assigns it to other lands, it is the general sign of illuminating other lands.**

### [ANALYSIS OF OTHER LANDS' OMENS] (光照他土六瑞)

**次明光照他土六瑞者，一見六趣，二見諸佛，即是上聖下凡為一雙，三聞佛說法，四見四眾得道，即是人法一雙，五見菩薩行行，六見佛涅槃，即是始終一雙。既有可化眾生，即有能化之佛，有佛即有說法，說法即有弟子，弟子即是行始，行始必致終也。若此土六瑞，總報眾生當獲自覺；彼土六瑞，總報眾生當獲覺他。又此彼六瑞，表此彼諸佛道同。從「盡見彼土六趣眾生」下，至「行菩薩道」者，是現彼土已與此同。從「復見諸佛」下，至「七寶塔」者，是現此土當與彼同。略說竟。更廣說者，從又見六趣眾生，是現彼佛為五濁故出現於世，此佛亦然，二土出世意同也。及「聞諸佛所說經」者，是現彼佛初從無相一法非頓而頓，與此土初說《華嚴》意同也。從「并見諸比丘」下，是現彼佛非漸而漸，與此土佛次說三藏意同也。從「復見諸菩薩」下，是彼佛三藏之後，說方等、《般若》眾經，與此土佛三藏之後意同也。從「復見諸佛」下，至「起七寶塔」，是現彼佛般若之後開權顯實，收無量法還入一法，唱入涅槃息化起塔，光照彼土始終究竟炳然在目。當知此土從一出無量，非頓而頓、非漸而漸，其事已竟，必當收無量法還入一法，開權顯實、息化歸真，與彼土同也。**

**Next, explaining the Six Omens of the light illuminating other lands: (1) seeing the six destinies; (2) seeing the Buddhas - this is the pair of superior sages and inferior ordinary beings; (3) hearing the Buddhas expound the Dharma; (4) seeing the four assemblies attain the Way - this is the pair of person and Dharma; (5) seeing bodhisattvas practicing conduct; (6) seeing Buddhas' nirvāṇa - this is the pair of beginning and end. Since there are sentient beings to be transformed, there are Buddhas who can transform; having Buddhas, there is preaching; having preaching, there are disciples; disciples are the beginning of practice; practice must reach the end.**
*[Critical apparatus: [9] 眾【大】，之眾【甲】; [10] 經【大】，經法【甲】; [11] 竟【大】，竟日【甲】; [12] 出【大】，生出【甲】]*


**If it is This Land's Six Omens, they generally report that sentient beings will obtain self-enlightenment. If it is that land's Six Omens, they generally report that sentient beings will obtain enlightening others. Moreover, the Six Omens here and there symbolize that the Way of the Buddhas here and there is the same.**[^10]

**From \"fully seeing the six-destinies beings in that land\" down to \"practicing the bodhisattva path\" reveals that that land is already the same as this. From \"also seeing the Buddhas\" down to \"the seven-jeweled stupa\" reveals that this land will be the same as that. This is the brief explanation; it is finished.**

**If explained more broadly: starting from seeing the six-destinies beings reveals that the Buddha of that land appears in the world because of the Five Turbidities; this Buddha is also so; the intent of appearing in the world in the two lands is the same. And \"hearing the sutras expounded by the Buddhas\" reveals that the Buddha of that land, from the single Dharma of marklessness, is \"non-sudden yet sudden\"; this is the same intent as This Land first expounding the *Avataṃsaka*.**[^11]

**From \"also seeing the bhikṣus\" downwards reveals that the Buddha of that land is \"non-gradual yet gradual\"; it is the same intent as This Land next expounding the Tripiṭaka. From \"also seeing the bodhisattvas\" downwards reveals that after the Tripiṭaka, that Buddha expounds the Vaipulya and Prajñā sutras; it is the same intent as This Land after the Tripiṭaka. From \"also seeing the Buddhas\" down to \"raising the seven-jeweled stupa\" reveals that after Prajñā, that Buddha opens the provisional and reveals the real, gathers immeasurable dharmas back into one dharma, announces entry into nirvāṇa, ceases transformation, and raises a stupa; the light makes that land's beginning and end, and its ultimate, clearly visible. One should know that in This Land, \"from one produces immeasurable,\" \"non-sudden yet sudden, non-gradual yet gradual\" - these matters are already concluded. It must be that [this Buddha] will gather immeasurable dharmas back into one dharma, open the provisional and reveal the real, cease transformation and return to truth; it is the same as that land.**

[^10]: **Self-Enlightenment vs. Enlightening Others:** This Land's omens (shaking, raining flowers) happen *here*, signaling the assembly's own awakening. The Light shines *there*, revealing the Buddha's work of saving others, signaling the Bodhisattva practice of enlightening others.

[^11]: **Non-Sudden yet Sudden:** Refers to the *Avataṃsaka* (Flower Adornment) period. It is \"Sudden\" (high-level teaching) but \"Non-Sudden\" in that it comes from the markless dharmakāya. Or, it matches the *Distinct* and *Perfect* teachings (Sudden) but is preached in a specific location (Non-Sudden/Gradual context).

**復次種種因緣者，昔善為因，今教為緣。又別說者，正是三藏之後，明共不共般若為因，助道戒定慧等為緣。約三人即有種種因緣。又就共不共人種種因緣、種種相貌者，共不共各四門，一一門復有無量相貌，五百比丘各說身因，即其義也。不共四門亦如是，故知因緣、相貌種別無量，皆是彼與此同，彼明此相因緣相貌，還入一因、一緣、一相、一貌，當知此土亦與彼同。**

**Furthermore, regarding \"various causes and conditions\": past goodness is the cause, and present teaching is the condition. Another, distinct explanation says: it is precisely after the Tripiṭaka, clarifying \"common\" and \"uncommon\" Prajñā as causes, and the assisting-path precepts, concentration, wisdom, and so on as conditions. In terms of the three persons, there are thereby various causes and conditions. Further: for common/uncommon persons' various causes-and-conditions and various marks-and-appearances: in both the common and uncommon there are four gates; within each gate there are again immeasurable marks-and-appearances. The five hundred bhikṣus each speaking their bodily causes is precisely this meaning. The four gates of the uncommon are likewise. Therefore we know that the kinds of causes-and-conditions and marks-and-appearances are immeasurably diverse; all are the same in that land and this. That land explains these marks-and-appearances of causes-and-conditions and returns them back into one cause, one condition, one mark, one appearance; one should know that this land is also the same as that land.**

## 14. PREFACE OF DOUBT (疑念序)

**「爾時彌勒作是念」訖「今當問誰」，是疑念序，文為兩：一、彌勒疑念，二、大眾疑念。**

**From "At that time Maitreya had this thought" to "Now whom shall I ask," this is the Preface of Doubting Thoughts (*Yí Niàn Xù*). The text has two parts: 1. Maitreya's Doubting Thoughts; 2. The Great Assembly's Doubting Thoughts.**

---

**彌勒有三念：一、正念六瑞，二、念問誰，三、念文殊。文殊念起，第二念除，唯初念在，但成一疑也。**

**Maitreya has three thoughts: 1. Directly pondering the Six Omens; 2. Pondering whom to ask; 3. Pondering Manjuśrī. When the thought of Manjuśrī arises, the second thought ["Whom to ask"] is removed; only the first thought [the Doubt itself] remains, thus forming a single Doubt.**

---

**「神變」者，神，內也；變，外也。神名天心，即是天然內慧；變名變動，即是六瑞外彰。**

**"Spiritual Transformation" (*Shén Biàn* - Vikurvaṇa): *Shén* (Spirit) is Internal; *Biàn* (Transformation) is External. *Shén* is called the "Heavenly Mind" (*Tiān Xīn*), which is the natural internal wisdom. *Biàn* is called "Transformation/Movement," which is the external manifestation of the Six Omens.**

---

**《首楞嚴》云：佛住不二法，能作神通，法王法力超蓋一切。**

**The *Śūraṅgama [Samādhi] Sutra* says: "The Buddha abides in the Non-Dual Dharma and can create spiritual powers (*abhijñā*). The Dharma Power of the Dharma King surpasses and covers everything."**

---

**彌勒不測外變，亦不知內慧，故興念至此。**

**Maitreya cannot fathom the external transformations, nor does he know the internal wisdom; therefore he gives rise to thought up to this point.**

---

**若夫庸人不知術者，散人不知定者，凡人不知聖者，小聖不知身子，身子不知菩薩，菩薩不知補處，補處不知尊極，此就極處亦不知也。**

**If ordinary people do not know techniques, scattered people do not know concentration, common people do not know sages, lesser sages do not know Śāriputra, Śāriputra does not know bodhisattvas, bodhisattvas do not know the successor, the successor does not know the utmost honored - then even at the ultimate point, [there is] not knowing.**[^12]

[^12]: **Hierarchy of Knowledge:** Zhiyi lists seven levels of understanding (Commoner → Scattered → Worldly → Small Sage → Śāriputra → Bodhisattva → Successor). Each level is "ignorant" compared to the one above it. Thus, even Maitreya does not fully know the Buddha's intent.

---

**又彌勒值佛植善既多，何容不髣髴知？應須隱明示闇，權言不知也。**

**Furthermore, Maitreya has met [many] Buddhas and planted much goodness; how could he not even vaguely know? It must be that he **"Hides Brightness and Displays Darkness"** (*Yǐn Míng Shì Àn*), provisionally saying he does not know.**

---

**大眾有兩念：一、正念六瑞，二、念問誰。若將下偈望此，亦得有三念，偈云：「四眾欣仰，瞻仁及我。」無第三念，何事瞻仁？而此中無者，欲推補處居先也。舊解先有三意：一、是補處，二、有三念，三、能發問。為此義故大眾闕一念也。**

**The great assembly has two thoughts: first, directly pondering the Six Omens; second, pondering whom to ask. If we look at this in relation to the following verse, we can also take there to be three thoughts. The verse says: "The four assemblies, admiring and looking up, gaze upon you and me." If there were no third thought, why would they gaze upon you? Yet here [in the prose] it is absent because it is intended to push the Successor (Maitreya) to take the first place. The old explanation first has three meanings: (1) he is the Successor; (2) there are three thoughts; (3) he is able to initiate the question. For this reason, the great assembly lacks one thought.**

---

**問：文殊、彌勒德位相亞，何故一問一答？**

**Question: Manjuśrī and Maitreya are equal in virtue and position (*Dé Wèi Xiāng Yà*). Why is it one asks and one answers?**

---

**答：夫機有在無，位雖齊等，賓主異宜，聖人承機非問者不能答也。**

**Answer: Catalyst (*Jī*) exists or not. Although positions are equal, Host and Guest have different suitabilities. The Sage responds to the Catalyst; if there is no questioner, he cannot answer.**

*[Critical apparatus: [1] 不分卷【甲】]*

---

**又法門有權實，權補處須問，實者須答。**

**Also, Dharma Gates have **Provisional** (*Quán*) and **Real** (*Shí*). The Provisional [Maitreya] Successor must ask; the Real One [Manjuśrī] must answer.[^13]**

[^13]: **Provisional asking Real:** Maitreya represents the *position* of Successor (Future Buddha), thus "Provisional." Manjuśrī represents the *wisdom* of Past Buddhas (Dragon Seed), thus "Real."

---

**又迹有久近，近問久答。**

**Also, Traces have **Long/Old** and **Near/New**. The Near [Maitreya, new successor] asks; the Long [Manjuśrī, past Buddha] answers.**

---

**又名有便易，彌勒名慈，慈為眾生應須問；文殊名妙德，德應須答。**

**Also, Names have appropriateness. Maitreya is named "Compassion" (*Cí*); Compassion for sentient beings means he must ask. Manjuśrī is named "Wondrous Virtue" (*Miào Dé*); Virtue means he must answer.**

---

**此即四種消文意。**

**These are the four meanings of interpreting the text.**
