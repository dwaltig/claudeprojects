## Translation: Fascicle 3, Part 2

### 1. The Fourth Lemma: Non-Provisional, Non-Real

**一切法非權非實者，文云：「非如非異」又云：「亦復不行上中下法，有為無為、實不實法，非虛非實如實相也。」**
**"All dharmas are neither provisional nor real," as the text states: "It is neither like nor different." And again: "It also does not practice superior, medium, or inferior dharmas, conditioned or unconditioned, real or unreal dharmas; it is neither empty nor real, but like the Real Mark [Reality itself]."**

**若一切法皆權，何所不破？**
**If [one argues that] all dharmas are provisional, what is not destroyed [by this view]?**

**縱令百千種師，一一師作百千種說，無不是權，**
**Even if a hundred thousand masters each make a hundred thousand explanations, none are not provisional.**

**如來有所說尚復是權，況復人師寧得非權？**
**If what the Tathāgata says is still provisional, how could human masters obtain that which is non-provisional?**

**如前所出悉皆權也，**
**As produced before, all are indeed provisional.**

**若一切法皆實者，何所不破？**
**If [one argues that] all dharmas are real, what is not destroyed?**

**「唯此一事實，餘二則非真」但一究竟道，寧得眾多究竟道耶？**
**[As the sutra says:] "Only this one matter is real (fact), the other two are not true." There is only one Ultimate Way; how could there be many "Ultimate Ways"?**

**如前所出諸師，皆破入實，寧復保其樔窟耶？**
**As the various masters produced before are all broken and [must] enter the Real, how can they preserve their old nests and caves [of provisional theories]?**

**若一切法亦權亦實，復何所不破？**
**If [one argues that] all dharmas are both provisional and real, again, what is not destroyed?**

**一切悉有權有實，那得自是一途，非他異解，**
**If everything implies [both] provisionality and reality, how can one hold to one's own path as absolute while rejecting others' different interpretations?**

**一一法中皆有權實，不得一向權一向實也。**
**Within every single dharma there is [both] provisionality and reality; one cannot obtain a "purely provisional" or "purely real" [state].**

**若一切法非權非實，復何所不破？**
**If [one argues that] all dharmas are neither provisional nor real, again, what is not destroyed?**

**何復紛紜強生建立？**
**Why then is there this chaotic confusion of forced establishments [of doctrine]?**

**直列名尚自如此，遙觀玄覽曠蕩高明為若此，況論旨趣耶？**
**Merely listing the names is already like this [difficult]; remotely contemplating the dark mystery (*xuanlan*), which is vast, boundless, lofty, and bright, is like this—how much more so when discussing the profound import (*zhiqu*)?**

---

### 2. The Tenfold Expansion of Power/Real (Convenience/Truth)

**今就有權有實句更開十法，**
**Now, regarding the phrase "having provisionality and having reality," we further open up ten [pairs of] dharmas.**

**就十法中，為八番解釋：**
**Within these ten dharmas, we make eight turns of explanation:**

**一、列十名，二、生起，三、解釋，四、引證，五、結十為三種權實，六、分別三種權實照三種二諦，七、約諸經判權實，八、約本迹判權實。**
**1. Listing the Ten Names.**
**2. Origination (*Shengqi*).**
**3. Explanation (*Jieshi*).**
**4. Citation of Proof (*Yinzheng*).**
**5. Concluding the Ten into Three Types of Power/Real.**
**6. Distinguishing the Three Types of Power/Real illuminating the Three Types of Two Truths.**
**7. Judging Power/Real according to Various Sutras.**
**8. Judging Power/Real according to the Trace and Origin (*Benji*).**

#### I. Listing the Ten Names

**一、列名者，謂事理、理教、教行、縛脫、因果、體用、漸頓、開合、通別、悉檀，即是十種名也。**
**1. Listing the Names: That is, 1. Matter/Principle (*Shi-Li*), 2. Principle/Teaching (*Li-Jiao*), 3. Teaching/Practice (*Jiao-Xing*), 4. Bondage/Liberation (*Fu-Tuo*), 5. Cause/Effect (*Yin-Guo*), 6. Essence/Function (*Ti-Yong*), 7. Gradual/Sudden (*Jian-Dun*), 8. Opening/Closing (*Kai-He*), 9. General/Specific (*Tong-Bie*), 10. Siddhāntas (*Xitan*). These are the ten names.**

#### II. Origination (Shengqi)

**二、生起者，從無住本立一切法。**
**2. Origination: From the "Non-Abiding Base" (*Wuzhu Ben*)[^1], all dharmas are established.**

**無住者，理也；一切法者，事也。**
**"Non-Abiding" is the Principle (*Li*); "All dharmas" are Matter/Events (*Shi*).**

**理事故有教，**
**Because of [the distinction/relation of] Principle and Matter, there is Teaching (*Jiao*).**

**由教故有行，**
**Due to Teaching, there is Practice (*Xing*).**

**由行故有縛脫，**
**Due to Practice, there is Bondage and Liberation (*Fu-Tuo*).**

**由脫故成因果，**
**Due to Liberation, Cause and Effect (*Yin-Guo*) are completed.**

**由果故明顯能用，**
**Due to the Effect [Result], the Essence is revealed and executes Function (*Ti-Yong*).**

**故有漸頓之化，**
**Therefore, there is the transformation of Gradual and Sudden (*Jian-Dun*).**

**由開漸頓故有於開合，**
**Due to opening the Gradual and Sudden, there is Opening and Closing (*Kai-He*).**

**開合故有通別之益，**
**Due to Opening and Closing, there are General and Specific Benefits (*Tong-Bie*).**

**分別兩益故有四悉檀，是為十章次第(云云)。**
**Distinguishing these two benefits, there are the Four Siddhāntas. This is the sequence of the ten chapters (etc.).**

#### III. Explanation (Jieshi)

**三、解釋者，理是真如，真如本淨，有佛無佛常不變易故，名理為實；**
**3. Explanation:**
***   Matter/Principle: "Principle" is *Tathātā* (True Suchness). True Suchness is originally pure; whether there are Buddhas or no Buddhas, it remains eternally unchanging. Thus, we name Principle as Real.**

**事是心意識等，起淨、不淨業，改動不定故，名事為權。**
**"Matter" (*Shi*) is the mind, intellect, and consciousness (*citta-manas-vijñāna*), etc., which give rise to pure and impure karma. Because they change and move and are not fixed, we name Matter as Provisional (Convenient/Power).**

**若非理無以立事，非事不能顯理，事有顯理之功，是故殷勤稱歎方便。**
**If not for Principle, there is no way to establish Matter; if not for Matter, one cannot reveal Principle. Matter has the merit of revealing Principle; therefore, [the Buddha] earnestly praises Expedient Means (*Upāya*/Convenience).**

**理教者，總前理事皆名為理，例如真俗俱稱為諦，**
**Principle/Teaching: Summarizing the previous Matter and Principle, both are [here] named "Principle." For example, both the Real and Secular are called "Truths" (*Satya*).**

**諸佛體之而得成聖，聖者正實也，**
**The Buddhas embody this and assume sagehood; the Sage is Correct and Real.**

**欲以己法下被眾生，因理而設教，教即權也，**
**Desiring to use their own Dharma to downwardly cover sentient beings, they establish Teachings based on this Principle. The Teaching is Provisional.**

**非教無以顯理，顯理由教，是故如來稱歎方便(云云)。**
**If not for Teaching, there is no way to reveal Principle; revealing Principle comes from Teaching. Therefore, the Tathāgata praises Expedient Means (etc.).**

**教行者，依教求理則生正行，行有進趣深淺之殊，故行名權也；**
**Teaching/Practice: Relying on the Teaching to seek Principle generates Correct Practice. Practice has differences of progress and depth; therefore, Practice is named Provisional.**

**教無進趣深淺之異，故教名實也。**
**The Teaching [itself] lacks differences of progress or depth; therefore, Teaching is named Real. [^2]**

**非教無以立行，非行無以會教，會教由行，是故如來稱歎方便(云云)。**
**If not for Teaching, there is no way to establish Practice; if not for Practice, one cannot meet [realize] the Teaching. Meeting the Teaching comes from Practice. Therefore, the Tathāgata praises Expedient Means (etc.).**

**縛脫者，為行違理則縛，縛是虛妄故稱權；**
**Bondage/Liberation: If, in practicing, one violates Principle, it is Bondage. Bondage is illusion/falsehood, thus it is called Provisional.**

**為行順理則生解，解冥於理故稱實。**
**If, in practicing, one accords with Principle, it generates Liberation (*Jie*). Liberation merges obscurely (*Ming*) with Principle, thus it is called Real.**

**非縛無由求脫，得脫由縛，如因屍渡海，屍有濟岸之力，故稱歎方便。**
**If not for Bondage, there is no cause to seek Liberation; obtaining Liberation comes from Bondage. It is like relying on a corpse to cross the sea [reference to *Nirvana Sutra*]: the corpse has the power to help reach the shore. Therefore, [He] praises Expedient Means.**

**因果者，因有進趣暫用故名權，果有剋終永證故為實。**
**Cause/Effect: Cause has progress and temporary use, thus it is named Provisional. Effect [Fruit] has ultimate mastery and eternal functioning, thus it is Real.**

**無果，因無所望；無因，果不自顯。**
**Without Result, Cause has no hope; without Cause, Result does not self-reveal.**

**是以二觀為方便道，斷惑成因得入中道解脫之果，**
**Therefore, the Two Contemplations [Empty and Provisional] act as the Expedient Path, cutting off confusion and forming the Cause (*Hetu*), obtaining entry into the Fruit of the Middle Way Liberation.**

**若非二觀豈契中道？果由因剋，故稱歎方便。**
**If not for the Two Contemplations, how could one accord with the Middle Way? The Fruit is mastered through the Cause; therefore, [He] praises Expedient Means.**

**體用者，前方便為因，正觀入住為果，住出為體用，**
**Essence/Function: The previous Expedients are the Cause; Correct Contemplation entering Abiding [realization] is the Fruit. Abiding and Emerging are Essence and Function. [^3]**

**體即實相無有分別，用即立一切法差降不同，**
**Essence is the Real Mark (*Dharmatā*), which has no discrimination. Function establishes all dharmas with differences and gradations.**

**如大地一生種種芽，非地無以生，非生無以顯，尋流得源推用識體，用有顯體之功，故稱歎方便。**
**It is like the great earth producing various sprouts. Without the earth, nothing grows; without growth, nothing is revealed. By tracing the stream you find the source; by inferring from Function you recognize Essence. Function has the merit of revealing Essence; therefore, [He] praises Expedient Means.**

**漸頓者，修因證果從體起用，俱有漸頓，**
**Gradual/Sudden: Cultivating Cause, verifying Fruit, and arising Function from Essence—all possess Gradual and Sudden [aspects].**

**今明起用，用漸為權、用頓為實，**
**Now we clarify "Arising Function": functioning gradually is Provisional; functioning suddenly is Real.**

**若非漸引無由入頓，從漸得實，故稱歎方便。**
**If not for Gradual leading, there is no way to enter the Sudden. From the Gradual one obtains the Real; therefore, [He] praises Expedient Means.**

**開合者，從頓開漸，漸自不合亦不合頓，故名為權；**
**Opening/Closing: From the Sudden, opening out the Gradual. The Gradual does not unite with itself, nor does it unite with the Sudden; therefore it is named Provisional. [^4]**

**漸令究竟還合於頓，故名為實。**
**The Gradual causes one to reach the Ultimate, returning to unite with the Sudden; therefore it is named Real.**

**由開故合，開有合力從開受名，故稱歎方便。**
**Due to Opening, there is Closing. Opening possesses the power to Close; receiving the name from "Opening," therefore [He] praises Expedient Means.**

**通別益者，通則半字無常之益，別即滿字常住之益。**
**General/Specific Benefits: "General" means the benefit of the Half-Word [Letter], Impermanence. "Specific" implies the benefit of the Full-Word, Permanence/Abiding.**

**然常益道長，喜生退沒故，以化城接引，生安隱想，然後息化引至寶所，**
**However, the Path of Permanent Benefit is long, and one is prone to retreat or sink. Thus, using the Conjured City to receive and guide them, generating the thought of peace and comfort; afterwards, extinguishing the Conjured and leading to the Treasure Place.**

**若無半益不得會常，半有顯滿之功，故稱歎方便。**
**If not for the "Half" benefit, one could not meet the "Permanent." The "Half" has the merit of revealing the "Full"; therefore, [He] praises Expedient Means.**

**四悉檀者，三是世間是故為權，第一義是出世是故為實。**
**Four Siddhāntas: The [first] three are worldly, therefore they are Provisional. The Primary Meaning (*Paramārtha*) is world-transcending, therefore it is Real.**

**非世不得出世，由三悉檀得第一義，是故如來稱歎方便。**
**Without the worldly, one cannot obtain the world-transcending. Through the three Siddhāntas one obtains the Primary Meaning; therefore the Tathāgata praises Expedient Means.**

**當用四句釋十番權實，三番是他經意，一番是此品意(云云)。**
**One should use the Four Phrases to explain the ten types of Power/Real. Three phrases are the intent of other sutras; one phrase is the intent of this chapter (etc.).**

#### IV. Citation of Proof (Yinzheng)

**四引證者，此十義通大小教，亘一切法，且引今經「不如三界見於三界」，**
**4. Citation of Proof: These ten meanings pervasively cover the Great and Small Teachings, spanning all dharmas. We tentatively cite this sutra: "Not seeing the Three Realms as the Three Realms [are usually seen]"—**

**三界者是事，不如三界見者理也；**
**"The Three Realms" is Matter (*Shi*). "Not seeing the Three Realms [as such]" is Principle (*Li*).**

**「諸法寂滅不可言宣」是理，「方便力為五比丘說」是教。**
**"All dharmas are quiescent and extinguishing, un-expressible by words" is Principle. "By the power of Expedient Means, speaking for the five bhikshus" is Teaching.**

**「若聞此經是善行菩薩道證」，教行也。**
**"If one hears this sutra, it is the verification of good practice of the Bodhisattva Way"—this is Teaching/Practice.**

**又「汝等所行是菩薩道，佛子行道已，來世得作佛」。**
**Also: "What you are practicing is the Bodhisattva Way; purify the Buddha-seeds, practice the Way, and in the future obtain Buddhahood."**

**又「種種因緣而求佛道，但離虛妄名為解脫」，**
**Also: "By various causes and conditions seeking the Buddha Way; merely separating from falsehood is named Liberation."**

**「未得一切解脫，盡行諸佛所有道法，道場得成果」(云云)。**
**"Not yet obtaining 'All' Liberation; completely practicing the Way-dharmas of all Buddhas; at the Bodhimanda obtaining the Fruit" (etc.).**

**「我以佛眼觀見六道眾生，始見我身，聞我所說，即皆信受入如來慧，除先修習學小乘者」(云云)。**
**"I, with the Buddha Eye, observe sentient beings of the six paths, in impoverished and lowly conditions, suffering from birth and death..." initially seeing my body, hearing what I say, immediately believing and accepting, entering the Tathāgata's Wisdom; "except those who previously cultivated and studied the Small Vehicle" (etc.).**

**窮子初逃，中間客糞，後則付財，初息化城後引寶所，種種欲種種性相憶念等，此通引一部為證。**
**The Poor Son initially fleeing (Loss), in the middle working as a hired dung-remover (Gradual), later entrusted with the wealth (Sudden/Real). Initially resting in the Conjured City, later led to the Treasure Place. Various desires, various natures, marks, memories, etc. This generally cites the entire [Sutra] text as proof.**

**今別引一品，雖不次第，十文具足。**
**Now we specifically cite *one chapter* [Skillful Means]. Although not in sequence, the text for all ten [pairs] is complete.**

**「諸佛智慧甚深無量，其智慧門難解難入」者，一切事理境智等，悉名為實，施設詮辯阿含言教悉是智慧門，此證理教論權實；**
**"The wisdom of all Buddhas is extremely profound and measureless; the wisdom-gate is difficult to understand and difficult to enter." All Matter/Principle, Boundary/Wisdom, etc., are named Real. Establishing explanations and debates, the *Agama* verbal teachings are all the "Wisdom Gate." This proves the discussion of Power/Real via Principle/Teaching.**

**難解難入，一切聲聞支佛不能知者，即是縛脫論權實。**
**"Difficult to understand and difficult to enter, which all Voice-Hearers and Pratyekabuddhas cannot know"—this discusses Power/Real via Bondage/Liberation.**

**所以者何？「佛曾親近」至「名稱普聞」，即是教行論權實；**
**Why? "The Buddha has intimately approached [numberless Buddhas]" up to "name and fame universally heard"—this discusses Power/Real via Teaching/Practice.**

**「成就甚深」至「意趣難解」，即是體用論權實；**
**"Perfecting the extremely profound [Dharma]" up to "the purport is difficult to understand"—this discusses Power/Real via Essence/Function.**

**「吾從成佛已來」者，成佛即是果，果必有因，即是因果論權實；**
**"Since I accomplished Buddhahood"—Accomplishing Buddhahood is the Fruit; Fruit must have a Cause. This discusses Power/Real via Cause/Effect.**

**「種種因緣譬喻，至令離諸著」，即是漸頓論權實。**
**"By various causes, conditions, and similes [expounding the Dharma]" up to "causing them to detach from various attachments"—this discusses Power/Real via Gradual/Sudden.**

**所以者何？「如來方便知見皆已具足」，即是開合論權實；**
**Why? "The Tathāgata's expedient knowledge and vision are all already complete"—this discusses Power/Real via Opening/Closing.**

**「諸佛為大事因緣故出現於世，為令眾生開示悟入佛之知見故」者，是為利益論權實。**
**"All Buddhas appear in the world for the sake of the One Great Matter [Causes and Conditions] to cause sentient beings to Open, Show, Awaken, and Enter the Buddha's Knowledge and Vision"—this discusses Power/Real via Benefit (General/Specific).**

**「取要言之，佛悉成就」，即是三悉檀成就也，「止止不須說」，即是第一義悉檀，是為四悉檀論權實。**
**"To take the essential point, the Buddha has perfected [all Dharmas]"—this is the perfection of the Three Siddhāntas. "Stop, stop, no need to speak"—this is the Primary Meaning Siddhānta. This discusses Power/Real via Four Siddhāntas.**

**所以者何？「佛悉成就第一希有」至「諸法實相」，即是理；**
**Why? "The Buddha has fully perfected the foremost, rare [Dharma]" up to "the Real Mark of all dharmas"—this is Principle.**

**「所謂諸法如是相」者，即是事，是為理事論權實。**
**"That is to say, all dharmas: such a Mark [Nature, etc.]"—this is Matter. This discusses Power/Real via Matter/Principle.**

**此一段長行明五佛權實，佛佛皆爾。**
**This long passage of prose explains the Power/Real of the Five Buddhas; every Buddha is like this.**

### 3. The Main Discourse Division (Lines 236-275)

**○從此品下，訖〈分別功德品〉十九行偈，或至偈後現在四信弟子文盡，名為正說分。**
**From this chapter down to the 19 verses of the *Distinctions in Merit Chapter*, or up to the end of the text on the "Four Faiths of Disciples in the Present," is named the Main Discourse Division (*Zhengshuo Fen*).**

**若作兩正說，從此下訖〈授學無學人記品〉，是迹門正說。**
**If making "Two Main Discourses" [Trace and Origin], then from here down to the *Prophecies for Learners and Adepts Chapter* is the Trace Gate Main Discourse.**

**今且逐近，就迹門正說更為兩：一、從此下，是略開三顯一；二、從「告舍利弗汝已殷勤」下，是廣開三顯一。**
**Now, pursuing the immediate context, within the Trace Gate Main Discourse, we further divide it into two: 1. From here downwards is the "Brief Opening of the Three to Reveal the One." 2. From "I tell Sariputra, you have already been earnest [requesting]" is the "Wide Opening of the Three to Reveal the One."**

**○略更為二：初、從「爾時世尊」下，是略開三顯一；二、從「爾時大眾」下，是動執生疑。**
**The "Brief Opening" is further divided into two: 1. From "At that time the World Honored One" is the Brief Opening of the Three to Reveal the One. 2. From "At that time the Great Assembly" is Shaking Attachments and Birthing Doubts.**

**略開三顯一，有長行、偈頌。長行為二：一、寄言歎二智；二、絕言歎二智。**
**The Brief Opening has prose and verses. The prose has two parts: 1. Praising the Two Wisdoms via Words (*Jiyan*). 2. Praising the Two Wisdoms transcending Words (*Jueyan*).**

**若不措言則無能知者，雖復稱揚言不能盡，諸佛二智如前說(云云)。**
**If one does not employ words, no one can know it; although one praises it, words cannot exhaust it. The Two Wisdoms of all Buddhas are as explained before (etc.).**

**寄言為二：一、明諸佛權實；二、明釋迦權實。**
**Praising via Words has two parts: 1. Clarifying the Power/Real of All Buddhas; 2. Clarifying the Power/Real of Shakyamuni.**

**諸佛道同是故俱歎，上光照他土，彌勒橫問，文殊引古，大眾豎聞，正表於此，故發軫定起，即明諸佛道同也。**
**The Way of all Buddhas is identical, therefore they are praised together. Previously, the Light shone on other lands, Maitreya asked horizontally, Manjushri cited the ancient vertically, and the Great Assembly heard it vertically—perfectly expressing this. Thus, rising from samadhi signifies the identity of the Buddha-Way.**

**就歎諸佛文為三：一、雙歎；二、雙釋；三、雙結。**
**Praising All Buddhas has three parts: 1. Double Praise; 2. Double Explanation; 3. Double Conclusion.**

**就雙歎中，先、經家提起；次、正歎。**
**Within Double Praise: First, the Sutra Compiler brings it up; Next, the Main Praise.**

**「爾時」者，當爾之時也，**
**"At that time" (*Ershi*) means exactly at that time.**

**佛常在定，何故言起？此有所示。**
**The Buddha is constantly in Samadhi; why does it say "Rise"? This has a demonstration.**

**往古諸佛說此經時，必前入無量義即入法華，今佛亦爾，此示世界悉檀哀從定起；**
**Ancient Buddhas, when speaking this Sutra, necessarily first entered *Immeasurable Meanings* then entered *Lotus*. The present Buddha is also like this. This demonstrates the Worldly Siddhāntas, compassionately rising from Samadhi.**

**履歷法緣二俱審諦，說必不謬增長物信，此示為人悉檀哀從定起；**
**Reviewing the Dharma and Conditions, both being thoroughly examined, the speech will definitely not be erroneous, increasing beings' faith. This demonstrates the Individual Siddhānta, compassionately rising from Samadhi.**

**佛寂而常照，尚須入定方乃說法，況復散心妄有所說，此是對治悉檀哀從定起；**
**The Buddha is quiescent yet constantly shining. If He still must enter Samadhi before speaking Dharma, how much more so [should we avoid] speaking falsely with a scattered mind? This demonstrates the Counteractive Siddhānta, compassionately rising from Samadhi.**

**入定緣理安心實相，出定令他安心實相，此是第一義悉檀哀從定起。**
**Entering Samadhi focuses on Principle, resting the mind in the Real Mark. Exiting Samadhi causes others to rest their minds in the Real Mark. This demonstrates the Primary Meaning Siddhānta, compassionately rising from Samadhi.**

**安此四法故言「安詳而起」也。**
**Established in these four dharmas, thus it says "Serenely and quietly arose" (*Anxiang er qi*).**

**「告舍利弗」者，小乘中智慧第一，將欲因其破小智、顯大智，廢會開覆凡十種，如《玄義》中說，此乃經家提起之文。**
**"Told Sariputra": He is foremost in wisdom among the Small Vehicle. [The Buddha] intends to use him to break small wisdom and reveal Great Wisdom. This is the text raised by the Sutra Compiler.**

### The Double Praise of Two Wisdoms

**就雙歎二智，先歎實，次歎權。**
**Regarding Double Praise of Two Wisdoms: First praising Real, next praising Provisional.**

**實者諸佛智慧也，非三種化他權實故言諸佛，顯自行之實故言智慧，此智慧體即一心三智。**
**Real: This is "The Wisdom of All Buddhas." It is not the three types of Converting-Others Power/Real, hence "All Buddhas." It reveals the Real of Self-Practice, hence "Wisdom." The essence of this Wisdom is the One Mind Three Wisdoms (*Yixin Sanzhi*). [^5]**

**「甚深無量」者，即稱歎之辭也。明佛實智豎徹如理之底故言甚深，橫窮法界之邊故言無量，**
**"Extremely Profound and Measureless": These are words of praise. It clarifies that the Buddha's Real Wisdom vertically penetrates the bottom of Principle (Profound) and horizontally exhausts the edges of the Dharma Realm (Measureless).**

**「其智慧門」即是歎權智也，蓋是自行道前方便，有進趣之力故名為門，從門入到道中，道中稱實、道前謂權也。**
**"Its Wisdom Gate": This praises Provisional Wisdom. It is the Expedient Means before the Path of Self-Practice. It has the power of progress/entry, hence named "Gate." From the Gate one enters the Path. Inside the Path is called Real; before the Path is called Provisional.**

**「難解難入」者，歎權智之辭也。**
**"Difficult to understand and difficult to enter": Words praising Provisional Wisdom.**

**從「所以者何」下，光宅云：「歎釋迦章」。今推文意，是雙釋諸佛二智也。**
**From "Why is this so?" downwards, Guangzhai says this praises Shakyamuni. Now inferring the text's intent, it is the Double Explanation of All Buddhas' Two Wisdoms.**

**「佛曾親近」至「盡行道法」，是釋諸佛實智，**
**"The Buddha has intimately approached [numberless Buddhas]" up to "exhaustively practiced the Way-dharmas" explains All Buddhas' Real Wisdom.**

**「勇猛精進名稱普聞」，是釋諸佛權智。**
**"Courageous and energetic, name and fame universally heard" explains All Buddhas' Provisional Wisdom.**

**從「成就甚深」下，雙結諸佛二智。**
**From "Perfecting the extremely profound [Dharma]" downwards, is the Double Conclusion of All Buddhas' Two Wisdoms.**

**稱理究竟故言成就，到彼岸底故言甚深，此結成實智也；**
**According with Principle to the ultimate, hence "Perfecting." Reaching the bottom of the Other Shore, hence "Extremely Profound." This concludes the Real Wisdom.**

**稱機適會故言隨宜，非七方便所知故言難解，此結成權智也。**
**According with Capacities (*Ji*) and fitting the meeting, hence "In accordance with what is appropriate" (*Suiyi*). Not known by the Seven Expedients, hence "Difficult to understand." This concludes the Provisional Wisdom.**

**從「吾從成佛已來」者，是歎釋迦權實。**
**From "Since I became Buddha" is the Praise of Shakyamuni's Power/Real.**

**「吾從成佛已來」歎實智。**
**"Since I became Buddha" praises Real Wisdom.**

**若實智不圓佛道不成，既云成佛，一成一切成，即是歎實智也。**
**If Real Wisdom were not perfect, the Buddha Way would not be accomplished. Since it says "Became Buddha," one accomplishment implies all accomplishments; thus it praises Real Wisdom.**

**「種種因緣」下，是歎權智。**
**"Various causes and conditions" praises Provisional Wisdom.**

**四十餘年以三種化他權實逗會眾生，故言種種因緣也。**
**For over forty years, meeting sentient beings with the three types of Converting-Others Power/Real; hence "Various causes and conditions."**

**從「所以者何」，是雙釋二智也。**
**From "Why is this so?" is the Double Explanation of the Two Wisdoms.**

**如來半句即是釋實智，從真如實相中來而得成佛道，故名如來，即釋成實智也；**
**The half-sentence "Tathāgata" explains Real Wisdom. Coming from *Tathātā* (True Suchness/Real Mark) and attaining the Buddha Way, hence named "Thus Come One" (*Tathāgata*). This explains Real Wisdom.**

**方便即是釋權智；**
**"Expedient Means" (*Upāya*) explains Provisional Wisdom.**

**由於方便善巧故能種種因緣知見波羅蜜者，即是雙舉權實知見也。**
**Because of convenient skill-in-means, being able to [use] various causes/conditions [to teach] "Knowledge and Vision Paramita": this brings up both Power and Real Knowledge/Vision.**

**從「如來知見廣大深遠」，即是雙結釋迦二智也。**
**From "The Tathāgata's Knowledge and Vision is broad, great, deep, and far," is the Double Conclusion of Shakyamuni's Two Wisdoms.**

**「無量無礙」下，即是結權智也。**
**From "Measureless, Unobstructed" concludes Provisional Wisdom.**

**從「舍利弗如來能種種分別」下，舊將結成前權實；今用起後將欲絕言，更舉權實為絕歎之由。**
**From "Sariputra, the Tathāgata is able to make various distinctions" Old interpretations take this to conclude the previous Power/Real. Now we use it to start the later section; intending to Transcend Words (*Jueyan*), we again bring up Power/Real as the cause for the "Praise Transcending Words."**

---

### 4. Praise Transcending Words (Jueyan Tan) (Lines 276-End)

**「止」者下，第二，即絕言歎也。**
**From "Stop" downwards is the Second part: Praise Transcending Words (*Jueyan Tan*).**

**印師云：「欲因止生其疑請之心也。」**
**Dharma Master Yin says: "Intending to use 'Stop' to generate the mind of doubt and request."**

**觀師云：「實法難知，故先抑止，驚其常情。」**
**Dharma Master Guan says: "The Real Dharma is difficult to know; thus first suppressing/stopping it to startle their ordinary feelings."**

**今明此法深寂言語道斷，體不可說，故止而歎之。**
**Now we clarify: This Dharma is deeply quiescent; the path of language is cut off. The Essence cannot be spoken; therefore, He stops and [thereby] praises it.**

**設慈悲為說，聞不能解，傷其善根，是故止也。**
**If, out of compassion, He were to speak it, hearing it they would not understand, injuring their roots of goodness. Therefore, He stops.**

**從「所以者何」下，是釋止歎之意。**
**From "Why is this so?" downwards explains the intention of "Stopping and Praising."**

**意為兩：一、就佛是最上人成就，修得最上法，故不可說；**
**The meaning is twofold: 1. Regarding the Buddha as the Supreme Person perfecting it, cultivating and obtaining the Supreme Dharma, therefore it cannot be spoken.**

**次、明甚深境界不可思議，故不可說。**
**2. Clarifying the Extremely Profound Boundary [State] is inconceivable, therefore it cannot be spoken.**

**就「佛成就」下，明上人權實橫滿不可說；**
**Regarding "The Buddha has perfected [the foremost, rare Dharma]" downwards: clarifying the Supreme Person's Power/Real is Horizontally Complete (*Heng Man*) and cannot be spoken.**

**從「唯佛與佛」下，明上人權實豎深不可說。**
**From "Only a Buddha and a Buddha" downwards: clarifying the Supreme Person's Power/Real is Vertically Profound (*Shu Shen*) and cannot be spoken.**

**成就對不成就，乃至難解對不難解，即是橫明成就，修道得故，故不可說。**
**"Perfected" vs "Not Perfected," up to "Difficult to Understand" vs "Not Difficult"—this clarifies perfection horizontally. Because it is obtained through cultivation, it cannot be spoken.**

**「唯佛與佛乃能究盡」者，初中分獲，未盡其源，如十四日月，光用未普；**
**"Only a Buddha and a Buddha can exhaustively fathom it": The initial and middle [stages] partially obtain it but do not exhaust its source; like the moon on the 14th day, its light and function are not yet universal.**

**獨佛與佛究竟邊底，如十五日之月，體無不圓、光無不遍，如此豎深，修道得故，故不可說。**
**Only a Buddha and a Buddha exhaust the boundaries and bottom; like the moon on the 15th day, its essence is perfectly round, its light is all-pervading. Being vertically profound like this, obtained through cultivation, therefore it cannot be spoken.**

**從「諸法實相」下，即是甚深境界不可思議，故不可說。**
**From "The Real Mark of all dharmas" downwards clarifies the Extremely Profound Boundary is inconceivable, thus unspeakable.**

**光宅云：「初一句標二智章，諸法標權智境。」三三非一故言諸法，三法之中其教最顯，教必逗機仍有其人，故知三三是權也。**
**Guangzhai says: "The first sentence marks the Two Wisdoms chapter, 'All Dharmas' marks the Provisional Wisdom Boundary." [He argues] the "Three Threes" are not one, thus "All Dharmas." Within the three dharmas, the teaching is most obvious, and the teaching must accord with capacities and still have its people; thus it is known that the Three Threes are Provisional. (Zhiyi cites this to refute).**

**實相者是實智境，一理非虛故言實相，四一之中遍舉一理，理是本故，故是實也。**
**"Real Mark" is the Real Wisdom Boundary. The One Principle is not false, hence "Real Mark." Within the "Four Ones," it strictly brings up the One Principle, because Principle is the Root; thus it is Real.**

**中有九句，還釋上兩章耳。前五句釋權章。**
**Within [the text] there are nine sentences, returning to explain the previous two chapters. The first five sentences explain the Provisional Chapter.**

**「如是相」者，三乘言教攬而可別也；**
**"Such a Mark": The verbal teachings of the Three Vehicles can be grasped and distinguished.**

**「如是性」者，三乘教性分不可移易也；**
**"Such a Nature": The nature of the Three Vehicle teachings is distinct and unalterable.**

**「如是體」者，三乘之教八音章句各各有體，菩薩教以六度為體(云云)；**
**"Such an Essence": The teachings of the Three Vehicles, with their Eight Tones and chapters/sentences, each have an essence. The Bodhisattva teaching takes the Six Paramitas as essence (etc.).**

**「如是力」者，三乘教用訓導之力也；**
**"Such a Power": The functionality of the Three Vehicle teachings has the power to instruct and guide.**

**「如是作」者，三乘教被前人有造作也，廣實智境，略不牒章。**
**"Such an Action": The Three Vehicle teachings cover the previous persons' constructions/actions. Broadly [explaining] the Real Wisdom boundary, briefly not listing the chapters.**

**實境有四一，以四廣其一理，「如是因」者，境生真解為因，萬善望果也；**
**The Real Boundary has "Four Ones." Using the four to broaden the One Principle: "Such a Cause": The boundary generates true understanding as Cause; myriad goodnesses look toward the Fruit.**

**「如是緣」者，境發實智為緣，以因所望處為果，果起酬因為報。**
**"Such a Condition": The boundary activates Real Wisdom as Condition. Taking what the Cause looks toward as Fruit. The Fruit arising to repay the Cause is Retribution.**

**後二句雙結，初句結權，「本」即舉相，「末」即舉作，次句結實，「究竟」即結因，「等」即結報也。**
**The last two sentences form a Double Conclusion. The first concludes Provisional: "Beginning" brings up Mark; "End" brings up Action. The next concludes Real: "Ultimate" concludes Cause; "Equal" concludes Retribution.**

**北地師云：四亦是權，三亦是權。瑤師云：四則是實。暢師云：三則是實。（智者評舊解）**
**The Northern Masters say: "Four is also Provisional; Three is also Provisional." Master Yao says: "Four is Real." Master Chang says: "Three is Real." (Zhiyi reviews old interpretations).**

**上來諸釋非不一途，然於理不通，於文不允。**
**The above interpretations are not without a path, but they do not penetrate the Principle and do not accord with the Text.**

**文不允者經云「諸法」，何法不收？豈止三乘耶？**
**"Does not accord with the Text": The Sutra says "All Dharmas" (*Zhu Fa*). What dharma is not included? Does it stop at only the Three Vehicles?**

**理不通者，經云「實相」，何所不在，而但在因果體？**
**"Does not penetrate Principle": The Sutra says "Real Mark." Where is it not present? Yet [they say] it is only in Cause, Fruit, and Essence?**

**今明此境為二：初一句略標權實章，如文；次十句廣釋權實相。**
**Now we clarify this boundary in two parts: 1. The first sentence briefly marks the Power/Real chapter, as in the text. 2. The next ten sentences broadly explain the marks of Power/Real.**

**今作四番釋：一、約十法界；二、約佛法界；三、約離合；四、約位。**
**Now we make Four Turns of Explanation:**
**1. According to the Ten Dharma Realms.**
**2. According to the Buddha Dharma Realm.**
**3. According to Separation and Combination.**
**4. According to Position/Stage.**

**經云「諸法」，故用十法界釋也；**
**The Sutra says "All Dharmas," therefore we use the Ten Dharma Realms to explain.**

**經云「佛所成就第一希有之法」，故用佛法界釋也；**
**The Sutra says "The foremost rare dharmas perfected by the Buddha," therefore we use the Buddha Dharma Realm to explain.**

**經云「止止不須說，我法妙難思」，故用離合釋也；**
**The Sutra says "Stop, stop, no need to speak, my Dharma is wonderful and difficult to conceive," therefore we use Separation and Combination to explain. [^6]**

**經云「唯佛與佛乃能究盡」，故用位釋也。**
**The Sutra says "Only a Buddha and a Buddha can exhaustively fathom it," therefore we use Position to explain.**

#### 1. According to the Ten Dharma Realms (Lines 282-283)

**約十法界者，謂六道、四聖，是為十法也。**
**According to the Ten Dharma Realms: Meaning the Six Paths and Four Sages; these are the Ten Dharmas.**

**法雖無量，數不出十，一一界中雖復多派，不出十如。**
**Although dharmas are measureless, their number does not exceed Ten. Within every single realm, although there are many branches, they do not exceed the Ten Suchnesses.**

**如地獄界，當地自具相性本末，**
**Like the Hell Realm: it inherently possesses its own Mark, Nature, [up to] Beginning and End.**

**亦具畜生界相性本末，乃至具佛法界相性本末，無有缺減，**
**It also possesses the Mark, Nature, Root, and Branch of the Animal Realm, up to possessing the Mark, Nature, Root, and Branch of the Buddha Dharma Realm, without lack or decrease. [^7]**

**故毘曇《毘婆沙》第七云：「地獄道成就他化天法」，即是其例，餘九法界亦如是。**
**Thus the *Abhidharma-vibhasha* (Fascicle 7) says: "The Hell Path perfects the dharmas of the Paranirmita-vasavartin Gods." This is an example; the other nine realms are also like this.**

**當知一一界皆有九界、十如，若照自位，九界、十如皆名為權；照其自位，佛界十如名之為實。**
**You should know: Every single realm possesses the Nine Realms and [their] Ten Suchnesses. If illuminating its own position [as distinct], the Nine Realms' Ten Suchnesses are all named Provisional. Illuminating its own position, the Buddha Realm's Ten Suchnesses are named Real.**

**一中具無量，無量中具一，所以名不可思議。**
**One contains Measureless; Measureless contains One. Therefore it is named Inconceivable.**

#### 2. According to the Buddha Dharma Realm (Lines 284-285)

**二、約佛法界釋者，佛界非相、非不相，而名如是相，指萬善緣因，故下文云「眾寶莊校」，即其義也。**
**2. According to the Buddha Dharma Realm: The Buddha Realm is neither Mark nor Non-Mark, yet is named "Such a Mark." It refers to the "Myriad Goodness Conditional Cause," as the text below says "Adorned with various gems"; this is the meaning.**

**佛界非性、非不性，而名如是性，指智慧了因，故下文云「有大白牛」也。**
**The Buddha Realm is neither Nature nor Non-Nature, yet is named "Such a Nature." It refers to the "Wisdom Revealing Cause," as the text below says "There is a Great White Ox." [^8]**

**佛界非體、非不體，而名如是體，指實相正因，故下文云「其車高廣」也。**
**The Buddha Realm is neither Essence nor Non-Essence, yet is named "Such an Essence." It refers to the "Real Mark Correct Cause," as the text below says "The carriage is high and broad."**

**佛界非力、非不力，而名為力，指菩提道心，慈善根力等，故下文云「又於其上張設幰蓋」也。**
**The Buddha Realm is neither Power nor Non-Power, yet is named "Power." It refers to the Bodhi Mind, Compassion, and Root Power, as the text below says "And on top of it set up canopies."**

**佛界非作、非不作，而名如是作，指任運無功用道，故下文云「其疾如風」也。**
**The Buddha Realm is neither Action nor Non-Action, yet is named "Such an Action." It refers to the effortless, unconditioned Way, as the text below says "Swift as the wind."**

**佛界非因、非不因，而名如是因，指四十一位，故下文「乘是寶乘遊於四方」也。**
**The Buddha Realm is neither Cause nor Non-Cause, yet is named "Such a Cause." It refers to the Forty-one Stages, as the text below says "Riding this Treasure Carriage, roaming the four directions."**

**佛界非緣、非不緣，而名如是緣，指一切助菩提道，故下文「又多僕從而侍衛之」。**
**The Buddha Realm is neither Condition nor Non-Condition, yet is named "Such a Condition." It refers to all aids to the Bodhi Way, as the text below says "Also many servants guarding it."**

**佛界非果、非不果，而名如是果，指妙覺朗然，圓因所剋，故下文「直至道場」也。**
**The Buddha Realm is neither Fruit nor Non-Fruit, yet is named "Such a Fruit." It refers to Marvelous Awakening being bright and clear, mastered by the Perfect Cause, as the text below says "Going straight to the Bodhimanda."**

**佛界非報、非不報，而名如是報，指大般涅槃，故下文「得無量無漏清淨之果報」也。**
**The Buddha Realm is neither Retribution nor Non-Retribution, yet is named "Such a Retribution." It refers to Great Parinirvana, as the text below says "Obtaining measureless, leakless, pure fruit-retribution."**

**佛果非本、非末，而言本末，本即佛相，末即佛報，是自行權也。**
**The Buddha Fruit is neither Beginning nor End, yet we speak of Beginning and End. Beginning is the Buddha Mark; End is the Buddha Retribution. This is the Self-Practice Provisional.**

**佛界非等、非不等，而言究竟等，指於實相，故標章云實相也。**
**The Buddha Realm is neither Equal nor Non-Equal, yet we speak of Ultimate Equality. It refers to the Real Mark, thus the chapter title says "Real Mark."**

**是自行之實也，即實而權故言本末，即權而實故言為等，**
**This is the Self-Practice Real. Because it is Real yet Provisional, we speak of Beginning and End. Because it is Provisional yet Real, we speak of Being Equal.**

**此是如來自行權實，最為無上。**
**This is the Tathāgata's Self-Practice Power/Real, which is most supreme.**

#### 3. According to Separation and Combination (Lines 286-287)

**三、約離合者，若佛心中所觀，十界、十如皆無上相，一佛乘無二無三，此即自行權實；**
**3. According to Separation and Combination: If contemplating within the Buddha's Mind, the Ten Realms and Ten Suchnesses are all Supreme Marks; there is only One Buddha Vehicle, no Two and no Three. This is the Self-Practice Power/Real.**

**若隨他意則有九法界、十如相性等，即是化他權實。**
**If according with others' minds, there are Nine Dharma Realms, Ten Suchnesses, Marks, Natures, etc. This is the Converting-Others Power/Real.**

**化他雖復有實，皆束為權；自行雖復有權，皆束為實，此即自行化他權實。**
**Although Converting-Others possesses the Real, it is all bundled as Provisional. Although Self-Practice possesses the Provisional, it is all bundled as Real. This is the Self-Practice Converting-Others Power/Real.**

#### 4. According to Position (Lines 288)

**四、約位者，如是相者，一切眾生皆有實相，本自有之，乃是如來藏之相貌也；**
**4. According to Position: "Such a Mark": All sentient beings possess the Real Mark; they originally possess it themselves. It is the mark of the *Tathāgatagarbha*. [^9]**

**如是性，即是性德智慧第一義空也；**
**"Such a Nature": This is the Virtue of Nature, Wisdom, the Primary Meaning Emptiness.**

**如是體，即是中道法性之理也，是為三德，通十法界位位皆有。**
**"Such an Essence": This is the Principle of the Middle Way Dharma Nature. These are the Three Virtues, pervasive in the Ten Dharma Realms, existing in every position.**

**若研此三德入於十信位，則名如是力、如是作；**
**If one grinds/polishes these Three Virtues and enters the Ten Faiths Position, it is named "Such a Power, Such an Action."**

**入四十一地，名如是因、如是緣；**
**Entering the Forty-one Lands [Stages], it is named "Such a Cause, Such a Condition."**

**若至佛地，名如是果、如是報。**
**If arriving at the Buddha Ground, it is named "Such a Fruit, Such a Retribution."**

**初三名本，後三名末，初後同是三德，故言究竟等。**
**The first three are named Beginning; the last three are named End. Beginning and End are identically the Three Virtues, therefore it says "Ultimately Equal."**

**Regarding the "Three Virtues": 1. The Real Mark of All Dharmas is the Dharma Body Virtue (*Dharmakāya*). 2. Knowing the various Dharmas is Wisdom Virtue (*Prajñā*). 3. Merits and various practices are Liberation Virtue (*Mokṣa*).**

**[290] 復次，三德究竟等者，若迷此境，即有六界相性，名為世諦；若解此境，即有二乘相性，名為真諦；達此非迷非解，即有菩薩、佛界性相中道第一義諦。**
**Furthermore, regarding "Three Virtues Ultimately Equal": If deluded regarding this boundary, there are the Marks/Natures of the Six Realms, named Worldly Truth. If understanding this boundary, there are the Marks/Natures of the Two Vehicles, named True Truth. Penetrating this as neither Delusion nor Understanding, there are the Nature/Marks of the Bodhisattva and Buddha Realms, the Middle Way Primary Meaning Truth.**

### 5. Commentary on the Verses (Lines 292-312)

**[292] 偈有二十一行，為兩：初十七行半頌長行，後三行半略開三顯一，動執生疑。**
**There are 21 verses, divided into two: 1. The first 17.5 verses eulogize the Prose. 2. The latter 3.5 verses explain the Brief Opening of the Three to Reveal the One, Shaking Attachments and Birthing Doubts.**

**初寄言中又二：初兩行合頌二佛二智，後二行合頌二佛釋歎結歎等也。**
**First, within "Praising via Words" there are two parts: 1. The first two lines collectively praise the Two Buddhas' Two Wisdoms. 2. The latter two lines collectively praise the Two Buddhas' explanation and conclusion.**

**初又二：今初一句「世雄」者，頌上諸佛智慧也。「不可量」者，頌上甚深無量。此頌諸佛實智也。**
**The first part has two: The first sentence "World Hero" praises All Buddhas' Wisdom. "Immeasurable" praises the "Extremely profound and measureless." This praises All Buddhas' Real Wisdom.**

**次三句頌上諸佛權智，此有三異：一者、上直明權實，此但歎權；二者、上直言難解，此出難解之意(無能測者)；三者、上云一切二乘不知，今言一切眾生類不知。**
**The next three sentences praise All Buddhas' Provisional Wisdom. This has three differences: 1. Above clearly elucidated both Provisional and Real; here it only praises Provisional. 2. Above directly said "difficult to understand"; here it brings out the *meaning* of difficult to understand (none can fathom). 3. Above it said "All Two Vehicles do not know"; now it says "All classes of sentient beings do not know."**

**「佛力」下，後一行頌歎釋迦二智也。「佛」者頌吾從成佛也，正頌實智；「力、無畏」等頌諸功德，是頌權智；**
**From "Buddha Power" downwards: The latter line praises Shakyamuni's Two Wisdoms. "Buddha" praises "Since I became Buddha," properly praising Real Wisdom. "Power, Fearlessness" etc. praises the various merits; this praises Provisional Wisdom.**

**「本從」下，後二行合頌二佛，釋歎結歎之意也。**
**From "Originally following" downwards: The latter two lines collectively praise the Two Buddhas, explaining the meaning of Explanation and Conclusion.**

**「本從無數佛具足行諸道」，頌上諸佛釋歎「佛曾親近百千諸佛盡行道法」之文也。**
**"Originally following numberless Buddhas, fully practicing all Ways": Praises the text "The Buddha has intimately approached a hundred thousand Buddhas, exhaustively practicing the Way-dharmas."**

**「勇猛精進名稱普聞，成就甚深未曾有法，隨宜所說意趣難解」，頌上諸佛結歎「勇猛精進名稱普聞，成就甚深意趣難解」之文也。**
**"Courageous and energetic, name and fame universally heard; perfecting the extremely profound, unprecedented Dharma; speaking according to what is appropriate, the purport is difficult to understand": Praises the text "Courageous and energetic, name and fame universally heard; perfecting the extremely profound, the purport is difficult to understand."**

**[298] 「止」者下，第二，即絕言歎也。**
**From "Stop" downwards is the Second part: Praise Transcending Words (*Jueyan Tan*).**

**文為五：初半行「如是大果報」，即頌不思議境，此境即諸佛果報也。**
**The text has five parts: 1. First half-line "Such great fruit-retribution" praises the Inconceivable Boundary; this Boundary is All Buddhas' Fruit Retribution.**

**「我及十方佛」下，第二，半行，追頌「取要言之佛悉成就」也。**
**From "I and the Ten Direction Buddhas" downwards: Second, half-line, retrospectively praises "To take the essential point, the Buddha has perfected [all]."**

**「不可示」下，第三，半行，追頌上「止不須說」也，實相非方所故不可示，非言說故不可說。**
**From "Cannot be shown" downwards: Third, half-line, retrospectively praises "Stop, no need to speak." Real Mark has no spatial location, thus "Cannot be shown," and it is beyond verbal expression, thus "Cannot be spoken."**

**從「諸餘眾生類」下，第四，頌舉不知之人，即三乘之人也。**
**From "All other classes of sentient beings" downwards: Fourth, praises/raises the persons who do not know, namely the people of the Three Vehicles.**

**「除諸」下，第二，二句，揀能入者，即圓教十信，故言「信力堅固者」也。**
**From "Except the various" downwards: Second, two sentences, selecting those who can enter—namely the Ten Faiths of the Perfect Teaching—thus it says "Those firm in the power of faith."**

**「諸佛法久後，要當說真實」，即頌上「世尊法久後，要當說真實」也。**
**"The Buddhas' Dharma, after a long time, must speak the truth": This praises the above "After a long time, the World Honored One's Law / Must speak the Truth."**

**「假使滿」下，第四，有一行，舉身子不知。**
**From "Even if filling" downwards: Fourth, one line, raising that Sariputra does not know.**

**「正使滿」下，第五，一行半，舉諸大弟子。**
**From "Even if filling" [again] downwards: Fifth, one line and a half, raising that all Great Disciples [do not know].**

**「辟支佛」下，第六，二行，舉支佛。**
**From "Pratyekabuddha" downwards: Sixth, two lines, raising Pratyekabuddhas.**

**「新發意」下，第七，二行半，舉發心菩薩不入。**
**From "Newly resolving" downwards: Seventh, two and a half lines, raising that newly resolved Bodhisattvas do not enter.**

**「不退菩薩」下，第八，有一行，揀不退菩薩亦不知也。**
**From "Non-sliding Bodhisattva" downwards: Eighth, one line, selecting that Non-sliding [Avaivartika] Bodhisattvas also do not know.**

**從「舍利弗當知諸佛語無異」下，略開三顯一，動執生疑。**
**From "Sariputra, you should know, the Buddhas' words have no difference" downwards: Brief Opening of the Three to Reveal the One; Shaking Attachments and Birthing Doubts.**

**「世尊法久後，要當說真實」，即顯真。**
**"After a long time, the World Honored One's Law / Must speak the Truth": This reveals the True.**

**「我等今者聞佛音，得除諸漏心安隱」，即顯權。**
**"We, hearing the Buddha's voice now, are able to remove all defilements and our minds are at peace": This reveals the Provisional.**

**從「爾時大眾」下，是騰疑致請。**
**From "At that time the Great Assembly" downwards is presenting doubts and making requests.**

### Scholarly Apparatus (Continued)

[^1]: **Non-Abiding Base (Wuzhu Ben)**:
Refers to the ultimate principle of Emptiness/True Suchness which has no fixed abode or characteristics, yet is the ground from which all phenomena (dharmas) arise. A key concept from the *Vimalakirti Sutra*.

[^2]: **Teaching named Real**:
Since the Teaching itself (the verbal expression of truth) is constant and does not undergo the changes of "progress" seen in Practice, it is categorized here as Real/Constant, whereas Practice is Provisional/Changing.

[^3]: **Essence/Function (Abiding/Emerging)**:
"Abiding" in the realization of Truth is the Essence (*Ti*). "Emerging" to interact with the world is the Function (*Yong*). This pairs the internal state (Real) with external application (Provisional).

[^4]: **Opening/Closing**:
"Opening" means revealing the Gradual as a method to reach the Sudden. "Closing" means identifying the Gradual as part of the Sudden. The Gradual in itself is Provisional; when it leads to the Ultimate, it is seen as Real.

[^5]: **One Mind Three Wisdoms (Yixin Sanzhi)**:
The "One Mind Three Wisdoms" is the core Tiantai epistemological framework. It refers to the simultaneous functioning of Three Wisdoms in a single moment of thought (One Mind). The Three Wisdoms are:
1.  **All-Knowledge (Sarvajñatā)**: Knowing Emptiness (breaking illusions of view and thought).
2.  **Path-Knowledge (Mārgajñatā)**: Knowing the Provisional (mastering infinite methods to save beings).
3.  **All-Mode-Knowledge (Sarvākārajñāna)**: Knowing the Middle (perfectly integrating Empty and Provisional).
In the Separate Teaching, these are sequential. In the Perfect Teaching (Tiantai), they are simultaneous ("One Mind").

[^6]: **Separation and Combination (Li-He)**:
*Li* (Separation) refers to viewing the Provisional and Real as distinct (Nine Realms vs Buddha Realm). *He* (Combination) refers to viewing them as integrated (Nine Realms *are* the Buddha Realm). In the Buddha's self-enlightenment, they are combined (One Vehicle). In teaching others, they are separated (Three Vehicles).

[^7]: **Mutual Possession of Ten Realms**:
This is the first seedling of the "Three Thousand Realms in a Single Moment of Thought" (*Yinian Sanqian*). Here Zhiyi states "Hell possesses the Buddha Realm," implying the potential for enlightenment is intrinsic even in the lowest state.

[^8]: **Three Causes of Buddha Nature**:
Zhiyi correlates the Ten Suchnesses with the Three Causes:
*   **Correct Cause (Zhengyin)**: The innate potential/truth (Essence/Real Mark) = "High and Broad Carriage".
*   **Revealing Cause (Liaoyin)**: The wisdom that realizes truth (Nature/Wisdom) = "Great White Ox".
*   **Conditional Cause (Yuanyin)**: The practices that support realization (Mark/Goodness) = "Adornments".

[^9]: **Tathāgatagarbha**:
