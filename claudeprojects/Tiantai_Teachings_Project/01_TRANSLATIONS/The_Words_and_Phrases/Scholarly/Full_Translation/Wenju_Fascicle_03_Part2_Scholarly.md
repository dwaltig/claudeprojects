## Translation: Fascicle 3, Part 2

### 1. The Fourth Lemma: Non-Provisional, Non-Real

**一切法非權非實者，文云：「非如非異」又云：「亦復不行上中下法，有為無為、實不實法，非虛非實如實相也。」**
**"All dharmas are neither provisional nor real," as the text states: "It is neither like nor different." And again: "It also does not practice superior, medium, or inferior dharmas, conditioned or unconditioned, real or unreal dharmas; it is neither empty nor real, but like the Real Mark [Reality itself]."**

**若一切法皆權，何所不破？**
**If [one argues that] all dharmas are provisional, what is not destroyed [by this view]?**

**縱令百千種師，一一師作百千種說，無不是權，**
**Even if a hundred thousand masters each make a hundred thousand explanations, none are not provisional.**

**如來有所說尚復是權，況復人師寧得非權？**
**If what the Tathāgata says is still provisional, how could human masters obtain that which is non-provisional?**

**如前所出悉皆權也，**
**As produced before, all are indeed provisional.**

**若一切法皆實者，何所不破？**
**If [one argues that] all dharmas are real, what is not destroyed?**

**「唯此一事實，餘二則非真」但一究竟道，寧得眾多究竟道耶？**
**[As the sutra says:] "Only this one matter is real (fact), the other two are not true." There is only one Ultimate Way; how could there be many "Ultimate Ways"?**

**如前所出諸師，皆破入實，寧復保其樔窟耶？**
**As the various masters produced before are all broken and [must] enter the Real, how can they preserve their old nests and caves [of provisional theories]?**

**若一切法亦權亦實，復何所不破？**
**If [one argues that] all dharmas are both provisional and real, again, what is not destroyed?**

**一切悉有權有實，那得自是一途，非他異解，**
**If everything implies [both] provisionality and reality, how can one hold to one's own path as absolute while rejecting others' different interpretations?**

**一一法中皆有權實，不得一向權一向實也。**
**Within every single dharma there is [both] provisionality and reality; one cannot obtain a "purely provisional" or "purely real" [state].**

**若一切法非權非實，復何所不破？**
**If [one argues that] all dharmas are neither provisional nor real, again, what is not destroyed?**

**何復紛紜強生建立？**
**Why then is there this chaotic confusion of forced establishments [of doctrine]?**

**直列名尚自如此，遙觀玄覽曠蕩高明為若此，況論旨趣耶？**
**Merely listing the names is already like this [difficult]; remotely contemplating the dark mystery (*xuanlan*), which is vast, boundless, lofty, and bright, is like this—how much more so when discussing the profound import (*zhiqu*)?**

### 2. The Tenfold Expansion of Power/Real (Convenience/Truth)

**今就有權有實句更開十法，**
**Now, regarding the phrase "having provisionality and having reality," we further open up ten [pairs of] dharmas.**

**就十法中，為八番解釋：**
**Within these ten dharmas, we make eight turns of explanation:**

**一、列十名，二、生起，三、解釋，四、引證，五、結十為三種權實，六、分別三種權實照三種二諦，七、約諸經判權實，八、約本迹判權實。**
**1. Listing the Ten Names.**
**2. Origination (*Shengqi*).**
**3. Explanation (*Jieshi*).**
**4. Citation of Proof (*Yinzheng*).**
**5. Concluding the Ten into Three Types of Power/Real.**
**6. Distinguishing the Three Types of Power/Real illuminating the Three Types of Two Truths.**
**7. Judging Power/Real according to Various Sutras.**
**8. Judging Power/Real according to the Trace and Origin (*Benji*).**

#### I. Listing the Ten Names

**一、列名者，謂事理、理教、教行、縛脫、因果、體用、漸頓、開合、通別、悉檀，即是十種名也。**
**1. Listing the Names: That is, 1. Matter/Principle (*Shi-Li*), 2. Principle/Teaching (*Li-Jiao*), 3. Teaching/Practice (*Jiao-Xing*), 4. Bondage/Liberation (*Fu-Tuo*), 5. Cause/Effect (*Yin-Guo*), 6. Essence/Function (*Ti-Yong*), 7. Gradual/Sudden (*Jian-Dun*), 8. Opening/Closing (*Kai-He*), 9. General/Specific (*Tong-Bie*), 10. Siddhāntas (*Xitan*). These are the ten names.**

#### II. Origination (Shengqi)

**二、生起者，從無住本立一切法。**
**2. Origination: From the "Non-Abiding Base" (*Wuzhu Ben*)[^1], all dharmas are established.**

**無住者，理也；一切法者，事也。**
**"Non-Abiding" is the Principle (*Li*); "All dharmas" are Matter/Events (*Shi*).**

**理事故有教，**
**Because of [the distinction/relation of] Principle and Matter, there is Teaching (*Jiao*).**

**由教故有行，**
**Due to Teaching, there is Practice (*Xing*).**

**由行故有縛脫，**
**Due to Practice, there is Bondage and Liberation (*Fu-Tuo*).**

**由脫故成因果，**
**Due to Liberation, Cause and Effect (*Yin-Guo*) are completed.**

**由果故體顯能用，**
**Due to the Effect [Result], the Essence is revealed and executes Function (*Ti-Yong*).**

**故有漸頓之化，**
**Therefore, there is the transformation of Gradual and Sudden (*Jian-Dun*).**

**由開漸頓故有於開合，**
**Due to opening the Gradual and Sudden, there is Opening and Closing (*Kai-He*).**

**開合故有通別之益，**
**Due to Opening and Closing, there are General and Specific Benefits (*Tong-Bie*).**

**分別兩益故有四悉檀，是為十章次第(云云)。**
**Distinguishing these two benefits, there are the Four Siddhāntas. This is the sequence of the ten chapters (etc.).**

#### III. Explanation (Jieshi)

**三、解釋者，理是真如，真如本淨，有佛無佛常不變易故，名理為實；**
**3. Explanation:**
***   Matter/Principle: "Principle" is *Tathātā* (True Suchness). True Suchness is originally pure; whether there are Buddhas or no Buddhas, it remains eternally unchanging. Thus, we name Principle as Real.**

**事是心意識等，起淨、不淨業，改動不定故，名事為權。**
**"Matter" (*Shi*) is the mind, intellect, and consciousness (*citta-manas-vijñāna*), etc., which give rise to pure and impure karma. Because they change and move and are not fixed, we name Matter as Provisional (Convenient/Power).**

**若非理無以立事，非事不能顯理，事有顯理之功，是故殷勤稱歎方便。**
**If not for Principle, there is no way to establish Matter; if not for Matter, one cannot reveal Principle. Matter has the merit of revealing Principle; therefore, [the Buddha] earnestly praises Expedient Means (*Upāya*/Convenience).**

**理教者，總前理事皆名為理，例如真俗俱稱為諦，**
**Principle/Teaching: Summarizing the previous Matter and Principle, both are [here] named "Principle." For example, both the Real and Secular are called "Truths" (*Satya*).**

**諸佛體之而得成聖，聖者正實也，**
**The Buddhas embody this and assume sagehood; the Sage is Correct and Real.**

**欲以己法下被眾生，因理而設教，教即權也，**
**Desiring to use their own Dharma to downwardly cover sentient beings, they establish Teachings based on this Principle. The Teaching is Provisional.**

**非教無以顯理，顯理由教，是故如來稱歎方便(云云)。**
**If not for Teaching, there is no way to reveal Principle; revealing Principle comes from Teaching. Therefore, the Tathāgata praises Expedient Means (etc.).**

**教行者，依教求理則生正行，行有進趣深淺之殊，故行名權也；**
**Teaching/Practice: Relying on the Teaching to seek Principle generates Correct Practice. Practice has differences of progress and depth; therefore, Practice is named Provisional.**

**教無進趣深淺之異，故教名實也。**
**The Teaching [itself] lacks differences of progress or depth; therefore, Teaching is named Real. [^2]**

**非教無以立行，非行無以會教，會教由行，是故如來稱歎方便(云云)。**
**If not for Teaching, there is no way to establish Practice; if not for Practice, one cannot meet [realize] the Teaching. Meeting the Teaching comes from Practice. Therefore, the Tathāgata praises Expedient Means (etc.).**

**縛脫者，為行違理則縛，縛是虛妄故稱權；**
**Bondage/Liberation: If, in practicing, one violates Principle, it is Bondage. Bondage is illusion/falsehood, thus it is called Provisional.**

**為行順理則生解，解冥於理故稱實。**
**If, in practicing, one accords with Principle, it generates Liberation (*Jie*). Liberation merges obscurely (*Ming*) with Principle, thus it is called Real.**

**非縛無由求脫，得脫由縛，如因屍渡海，屍有濟岸之力，故稱歎方便。**
**If not for Bondage, there is no cause to seek Liberation; obtaining Liberation comes from Bondage. It is like relying on a corpse to cross the sea [reference to *Nirvana Sutra*]: the corpse has the power to help reach the shore. Therefore, [He] praises Expedient Means.**

**因果者，因有進趣暫用故名權，果有剋終永證故為實。**
**Cause/Effect: Cause has progress and temporary use, thus it is named Provisional. Effect [Fruit] has ultimate mastery and eternal functioning, thus it is Real.**

**無果，因無所望；無因，果不自顯。**
**Without Result, Cause has no hope; without Cause, Result does not self-reveal.**

**是以二觀為方便道，斷惑成因得入中道解脫之果，**
**Therefore, the Two Contemplations [Empty and Provisional] act as the Expedient Path, cutting off confusion and forming the Cause (*Hetu*), obtaining entry into the Fruit of the Middle Way Liberation.**

**若非二觀豈契中道？果由因剋，故稱歎方便。**
**If not for the Two Contemplations, how could one accord with the Middle Way? The Fruit is mastered through the Cause; therefore, [He] praises Expedient Means.**

**體用者，前方便為因，正觀入住為果，住出為體用，**
**Essence/Function: The previous Expedients are the Cause; Correct Contemplation entering Abiding [realization] is the Fruit. Abiding and Emerging are Essence and Function. [^3]**

**體即實相無有分別，用即立一切法差降不同，**
**Essence is the Real Mark (*Dharmatā*), which has no discrimination. Function establishes all dharmas with differences and gradations.**

**如大地一生種種芽，非地無以生，非生無以顯，尋流得源推用識體，用有顯體之功，故稱歎方便。**
**It is like the great earth producing various sprouts. Without the earth, nothing grows; without growth, nothing is revealed. By tracing the stream you find the source; by inferring from Function you recognize Essence. Function has the merit of revealing Essence; therefore, [He] praises Expedient Means.**

**漸頓者，修因證果從體起用，俱有漸頓，**
**Gradual/Sudden: Cultivating Cause, verifying Fruit, and arising Function from Essence—all possess Gradual and Sudden [aspects].**

**今明起用，用漸為權、用頓為實，**
**Now we clarify "Arising Function": functioning gradually is Provisional; functioning suddenly is Real.**

**若非漸引無由入頓，從漸得實，故稱歎方便。**
**If not for Gradual leading, there is no way to enter the Sudden. From the Gradual one obtains the Real; therefore, [He] praises Expedient Means.**

**開合者，從頓開漸，漸自不合亦不合頓，故名為權；**
**Opening/Closing: From the Sudden, opening out the Gradual. The Gradual does not unite with itself, nor does it unite with the Sudden; therefore it is named Provisional. [^4]**

**漸令究竟還合於頓，故名為實。**
**The Gradual causes one to reach the Ultimate, returning to unite with the Sudden; therefore it is named Real.**

**由開故合，開有合力從開受名，故稱歎方便。**
**Due to Opening, there is Closing. Opening possesses the power to Close; receiving the name from "Opening," therefore [He] praises Expedient Means.**

**通別益者，通則半字無常之益，別即滿字常住之益。**
**General/Specific Benefits: "General" means the benefit of the Half-Word [Letter], Impermanence. "Specific" implies the benefit of the Full-Word, Permanence/Abiding.**

**然常益道長，喜生退沒故，以化城接引，生安隱想，然後息化引至寶所，**
**However, the Path of Permanent Benefit is long, and one is prone to retreat or sink. Thus, using the Conjured City to receive and guide them, generating the thought of peace and comfort; afterwards, extinguishing the Conjured and leading to the Treasure Place.**

**若無半益不得會常，半有顯滿之功，故稱歎方便。**
**If not for the "Half" benefit, one could not meet the "Permanent." The "Half" has the merit of revealing the "Full"; therefore, [He] praises Expedient Means.**

**四悉檀者，三是世間是故為權，第一義是出世是故為實。**
**Four Siddhāntas: The [first] three are worldly, therefore they are Provisional. The Primary Meaning (*Paramārtha*) is world-transcending, therefore it is Real.**

**非世不得出世，由三悉檀得第一義，是故如來稱歎方便。**
**Without the worldly, one cannot obtain the world-transcending. Through the three Siddhāntas one obtains the Primary Meaning; therefore the Tathāgata praises Expedient Means.**

**當用四句釋十番權實，三番是他經意，一番是此品意(云云)。**
**One should use the Four Phrases to explain the ten types of Power/Real. Three phrases are the intent of other sutras; one phrase is the intent of this chapter (etc.).**

#### IV. Citation of Proof (Yinzheng)

**四引證者，此十義通大小教，亘一切法，且引今經「不如三界見於三界」，**
**4. Citation of Proof: These ten meanings pervasively cover the Great and Small Teachings, spanning all dharmas. We tentatively cite this sutra: "Not seeing the Three Realms as the Three Realms [are usually seen]"—**

**三界者是事，不如三界見者理也；**
**"The Three Realms" is Matter (*Shi*). "Not seeing the Three Realms [as such]" is Principle (*Li*).**

**「諸法寂滅不可言宣」是理，「方便力為五比丘說」是教。**
**"All dharmas are quiescent and extinguishing, un-expressible by words" is Principle. "By the power of Expedient Means, speaking for the five bhikshus" is Teaching.**

**「若聞此經是善行菩薩道證」，教行也。**
**"If one hears this sutra, it is the verification of good practice of the Bodhisattva Way"—this is Teaching/Practice.**

**又「汝等所行是菩薩道，佛子行道已，來世得作佛」。**
**Also: "What you are practicing is the Bodhisattva Way; purify the Buddha-seeds, practice the Way, and in the future obtain Buddhahood."**

**又「種種因緣而求佛道，但離虛妄名為解脫」，**
**Also: "By various causes and conditions seeking the Buddha Way; merely separating from falsehood is named Liberation."**

**「未得一切解脫，盡行諸佛所有道法，道場得成果」(云云)。**
**"Not yet obtaining 'All' Liberation; completely practicing the Way-dharmas of all Buddhas; at the Bodhimanda obtaining the Fruit" (etc.).**

**「我以佛眼觀見六道眾生，始見我身，聞我所說，即皆信受入如來慧，除先修習學小乘者」(云云)。**
**"I, with the Buddha Eye, observe sentient beings of the six paths, in impoverished and lowly conditions, suffering from birth and death..." initially seeing my body, hearing what I say, immediately believing and accepting, entering the Tathāgata's Wisdom; "except those who previously cultivated and studied the Small Vehicle" (etc.).**

**窮子初逃，中間客糞，後則付財，初息化城後引寶所，種種欲種種性相憶念等，此通引一部為證。**
**The Poor Son initially fleeing (Loss), in the middle working as a hired dung-remover (Gradual), later entrusted with the wealth (Sudden/Real). Initially resting in the Conjured City, later led to the Treasure Place. Various desires, various natures, marks, memories, etc. This generally cites the entire [Sutra] text as proof.**

**今別引一品，雖不次第，十文具足。**
**Now we specifically cite *one chapter* [Skillful Means]. Although not in sequence, the text for all ten [pairs] is complete.**

**「諸佛智慧甚深無量，其智慧門難解難入」者，一切事理境智等，悉名為實，施設詮辯阿含言教悉是智慧門，此證理教論權實；**
**"The wisdom of all Buddhas is extremely profound and measureless; the wisdom-gate is difficult to understand and difficult to enter." All Matter/Principle, Boundary/Wisdom, etc., are named Real. Establishing explanations and debates, the *Agama* verbal teachings are all the "Wisdom Gate." This proves the discussion of Power/Real via Principle/Teaching.**

**難解難入，一切聲聞支佛不能知者，即是縛脫論權實。**
**"Difficult to understand and difficult to enter, which all Voice-Hearers and Pratyekabuddhas cannot know"—this discusses Power/Real via Bondage/Liberation.**

**所以者何？「佛曾親近」至「名稱普聞」，即是教行論權實；**
**Why? "The Buddha has intimately approached [numberless Buddhas]" up to "name and fame universally heard"—this discusses Power/Real via Teaching/Practice.**

**「成就甚深」至「意趣難解」，即是體用論權實；**
**"Perfecting the extremely profound [Dharma]" up to "the purport is difficult to understand"—this discusses Power/Real via Essence/Function.**

**「吾從成佛已來」者，成佛即是果，果必有因，即是因果論權實；**
**"Since I accomplished Buddhahood"—Accomplishing Buddhahood is the Fruit; Fruit must have a Cause. This discusses Power/Real via Cause/Effect.**

**「種種因緣譬喻，至令離諸著」，即是漸頓論權實。**
**"By various causes, conditions, and similes [expounding the Dharma]" up to "causing them to detach from various attachments"—this discusses Power/Real via Gradual/Sudden.**

**所以者何？「如來方便知見皆已具足」，即是開合論權實；**
**Why? "The Tathāgata's expedient knowledge and vision are all already complete"—this discusses Power/Real via Opening/Closing.**

**「諸佛為大事因緣故出現於世，為令眾生開示悟入佛之知見故」者，是為利益論權實。**
**"All Buddhas appear in the world for the sake of the One Great Matter [Causes and Conditions] to cause sentient beings to Open, Show, Awaken, and Enter the Buddha's Knowledge and Vision"—this discusses Power/Real via Benefit (General/Specific).**

**「取要言之，佛悉成就」，即是三悉檀成就也，「止止不須說」，即是第一義悉檀，是為四悉檀論權實。**
**"To take the essential point, the Buddha has perfected [all Dharmas]"—this is the perfection of the Three Siddhāntas. "Stop, stop, no need to speak"—this is the Primary Meaning Siddhānta. This discusses Power/Real via Four Siddhāntas.**

**所以者何？「佛悉成就第一希有」至「諸法實相」，即是理；**
**Why? "The Buddha has fully perfected the foremost, rare [Dharma]" up to "the Real Mark of all dharmas"—this is Principle.**

**「所謂諸法如是相」者，即是事，是為理事論權實。**
**"That is to say, all dharmas: such a Mark [Nature, etc.]"—this is Matter. This discusses Power/Real via Matter/Principle.**

**此一段長行明五佛權實，佛佛皆爾。**
**This long passage of prose explains the Power/Real of the Five Buddhas; every Buddha is like this.**

**然《法華論》解諸佛智慧甚深，為證甚深，甚深有五：謂義甚深、實體甚深、內證甚深、依止甚深、無上甚深。**
**However, the *Lotus Sutra Treatise*[^10] explains "All Buddhas' wisdom is extremely profound" as demonstrating profundity. Profundity has five: profundity of meaning; profundity of substantial essence; profundity of inner realization; profundity of reliance; and unsurpassed profundity.**

**無上甚深，謂證大菩提也，名智慧門為說阿含義甚深，此與理教權實意同；**
**"Unsurpassed profundity" means realizing great bodhi. It takes the "wisdom gate" as the preaching of the *Agamas*, calling it the "profundity of meaning"—this accords with the Matter/Principle discussion of Power/Real.**

**《論》解佛曾親近百千佛，為修行甚深；**
**The Treatise explains "The Buddha has intimately approached hundreds of thousands of Buddhas" as "profundity of cultivation/practice."**

**勇猛精進名稱普聞，為增長功德甚深，此與教行權實意同；**
**It explains "courageous and vigorous, name universally heard" as "profundity of increasing merits"—this accords with the Teaching/Practice discussion of Power/Real.**

**《論》解成就甚深未曾有法，為微妙事甚深；意趣難解等，為無上甚深、入甚深，此與體用權實意同。**
**It explains "accomplishing the profoundly deep, unprecedented Dharma" as "profundity of subtle matters." "The purport is hard to understand," and the like, are "unsurpassed profundity" and "entering profundity"—this accords with the Essence/Function discussion of Power/Real.**

**《論》解吾從成佛已來，為說如來功德成就法，此與因果權實意同。**
**It explains "Since I accomplished Buddhahood" as speaking the Tathagata's "merit-accomplishment Dharma"—this accords with the Cause/Effect discussion of Power/Real.**

**《論》解無數方便者即是教化成就、說法成就，此與漸頓、權實意同。**
**It explains "countless expedients" as the accomplishment of teaching/transforming and the accomplishment of preaching Dharma—this accords with the Gradual/Sudden discussion of Power/Real.**

**《論》解如來方便知見，乃至深入無際等，是自身成就不可思議境，勝餘一切菩薩，此是明利也。**
**It explains "the Tathagata's expedient knowledge and vision," up to "penetrating into the boundless without limit," and the like, as the Tathagata's own accomplishment of an inconceivable realm, surpassing all other bodhisattvas—this clarifies sharpness (keen capacity).**

**《論》解能種種分別，悅可眾心等，是言語成就，此是益也，與利益權實意同。**
**It explains "able to make various discriminations, pleasing the hearts of the assembly," and the like, as the accomplishment of language—this is "benefit," and accords with the Benefit discussion of Power/Real.**

**《論》解取要言之止不須說等，為可化眾生成就，此與四悉檀分別可化、不可化意同。**
**It explains "to take the essential point..." and "stop, no need to speak," and the like, as the accomplishment regarding transformable sentient beings—this accords with the Four Siddhantas' distinction between what can and cannot be transformed.**

**《論》解唯佛與佛乃能究盡，為無量福成就諸佛能知，謂如來法身之體不變故覺，能自證成就，能隨順眾生，說一切諸法相等，此與理事權實意同。**
**It explains "Only a Buddha and a Buddha can fully exhaust [this]" as: because immeasurable merit is accomplished, Buddhas can know. That is, because the essence of the Tathagata's Dharma-Body does not change, there is awakening; able to self-verify and accomplish; able to accord with sentient beings and speak the marks of all dharmas, and so on—this accords with the Matter/Principle discussion of Power/Real.**

**彼論解佛經，今疏冥符二聖，可謂與修多羅、優波提舍皆合也。**
**That Treatise explains the Buddha's scriptures. This commentary secretly accords with the two sages; it may be said to accord with both Sūtra and Upadeśa.[^11]**

#### V. Concluding Power/Real (Jie Quan-Shi)

**五、結權實者，此十種通四教，合四十權實。**
**5. Concluding Power/Real: These ten kinds pervade the Four Teachings, forming forty [types of] Power/Real.**

**若三藏中自證十法，名自行權實；說己十法利益眾生，名化他權實。**
**If, within the Tripitaka Teaching, one self-verifies the ten dharmas, it is named Self-Practice Power/Real. If one speaks one's ten dharmas to benefit sentient beings, it is named Converting-Others Power/Real.**

**化他之十皆合為權，自行之十皆合為實，名為自他權實。**
**The ten of Converting-Others are all bundled as Provisional; the ten of Self-Practice are all bundled as Real. This is named Self/Other Power/Real.**

**餘三教十法，束為三種權實亦如是。**
**For the other three teachings, the ten dharmas are likewise bundled as three kinds of Power/Real.**

**又當教各以事理、教行、縛脫、因果四種，為自行權實；各以理教、開合二種，是化他權實；各以體用、漸頓、通別、悉檀四種，為自他權實。**
**Further, within each teaching, it takes Matter/Principle, Teaching/Practice, Bondage/Liberation, and Cause/Effect as the four kinds of Self-Practice Power/Real; it takes Principle/Teaching and Opening/Closing as the two kinds of Converting-Others Power/Real; and it takes Essence/Function, Gradual/Sudden, General/Specific, and Siddhantas as the four kinds of Self/Other Power/Real.**

**其名雖同，其義各異也。**
**Although the names are the same, the meanings differ.**

**別結者，三教若通、若別，當分皆是化他權實，隨他意語故；圓教若通、若別，當分皆是自行權實，隨自意語故。**
**A further specific conclusion: for the three teachings, whether interpreted generally or specifically, in their own proper scope they are all Converting-Others Power/Real, because they are words "following others' intent." For the Perfect Teaching, whether general or specific, in its own proper scope it is all Self-Practice Power/Real, because it is words "following self-intent."**

**化他之三皆名為權，自行皆名為實。**
**The three [types] of Converting-Others are all named Provisional; Self-Practice is all named Real.**

**次、結成四句，隨他意語者，即一切法權；隨自意語者，即一切法實；雙取，即一切法亦權亦實；雙非，即一切法非權非實。**
**Next, it is concluded into four phrases: words following others' intent are \"all dharmas are provisional\"; words following self-intent are \"all dharmas are real\"; taking both is \"all dharmas are both provisional and real\"; negating both is \"all dharmas are neither provisional nor real.\"**

**次、結成三番釋品者，若自行自意者，此文稱道場所得法，《大經》云：「修道得故」，《攝大乘》稱如理如量智，皆是圓教自行權實，隨自意語。**
**Next, it is concluded into three rounds of interpreting this chapter: If it is Self-Practice / self-intent, then this text praises the Dharma obtained at the Bodhimanda. The \"Great Sutra\"[^12] says, \"because it is attained by cultivating the path\"; the *Mahāyānasaṃgraha*[^12] calls it \"wisdom as-it-is\" and \"wisdom as-it-measures\". These are all Perfect Teaching Self-Practice Power/Real—words following self-intent.**

**佛雖能於此不可說法，方便能說，而眾生不堪，若發軫單說此法取眾生者，即不能得也，故言不可說、不可說也。**
**Although the Buddha can, by expedients, speak this \"unspeakable\" Dharma, sentient beings cannot bear it. If, upon setting out, He were to speak only this Dharma to \"take\" sentient beings, He would fail to obtain them; therefore it says \"cannot be spoken\"—\"cannot be spoken.\"**

**復置此事，以自行權實，共別教權實，共取眾生者，大機利者直得、鈍者曲得，小機利鈍俱不得，蓋《華嚴》意也。**
**Again, setting this matter aside: if one uses Self-Practice Power/Real together with the Distinct Teaching Power/Real to \"take\" sentient beings, then for the Great faculties the sharp obtain directly and the dull obtain indirectly; for the Small faculties both sharp and dull obtain nothing—this is the intent of the *Avataṃsaka*.**

**復置此事，單用三藏權實取眾生者，大機利鈍者，密得、顯不得；小機利鈍者，但保於證，取亦不得，蓋三藏意也。**
**Again, setting this matter aside: if one uses only the Tripitaka Power/Real to \"take\" sentient beings, then among the Great faculties the sharp and dull obtain secretly but do not obtain manifestly; among the Small faculties the sharp and dull merely preserve their realization—yet still cannot be \"taken\"—this is the intent of the Tripitaka.**

**復置是事，合用四種權實，共取眾生者，大機利鈍者，曲直俱得；小機利鈍者，保證俱不得，蓋《方等》意也。**
**Again, setting this matter aside: if one combines and uses four kinds of Power/Real to \"take\" sentient beings, then among the Great faculties the dull and sharp both obtain, whether indirectly or directly; among the Small faculties the dull and sharp both fail to preserve realization—this is the intent of the Vaipulya (*Fāngděng*) teachings.**

**復置是事，捨三藏權實，用三種權實，共取眾生者，大機利鈍俱得；小機利鈍保證俱不得，蓋《般若》意也。**
**Again, setting this matter aside: if one discards Tripitaka Power/Real and uses three kinds of Power/Real to \"take\" sentient beings, then among the Great faculties the sharp and dull both obtain; among the Small faculties the sharp and dull both fail to preserve realization—this is the intent of Prajñā.**

**復置是事，捨三種權實，單用圓教自行權實取眾生者，大小機利鈍俱得，蓋《法華》意也。**
**Again, setting this matter aside: if one discards the three kinds of Power/Real and uses only the Perfect Teaching Self-Practice Power/Real to \"take\" sentient beings, then among both Great and Small faculties, sharp and dull all obtain—this is the intent of the *Lotus*.**

**如來智慧靡所不達，明照時宜用與可否，故釋品云，方者諸方法也，便者善巧用也，巧用方法取眾生得，是故殷勤稱歎方便。**
**The Tathagata's wisdom reaches everywhere; it illuminates clearly what is timely and what can or cannot be applied. Therefore, the explanation of the chapter says: \"Fāng\" means the various methods; \"Biàn\" means skillful application. By skillfully applying methods, one can \"take\" sentient beings and bring them to attainment; therefore, [the Buddha] earnestly praises Expedient Means.**

**復次如來自證權實俱不可說，愍念眾生說自證之權為門，於物非宜，眾生不能得入，故自證亦不可說。**
**Further: the Tathagata's self-verified Power/Real cannot be spoken. Out of compassion for sentient beings, He speaks the provisional aspect of self-verification as a \"gate\". Yet it is not suitable for beings; sentient beings cannot enter it; therefore the self-verified [Power/Real] is also \"unspeakable.\"**

**說別權實為門，利者得入，鈍者不入，於物非宜，別權實亦不可說。**
**If one speaks the Distinct Teaching Power/Real as a gate: the sharp enter; the dull do not. It is not suitable for beings; therefore Distinct Power/Real is also \"unspeakable.\"**

**說三藏權實為門，利者密入，鈍者亦不入，於物非宜，亦不可說。**
**If one speaks Tripitaka Power/Real as a gate: the sharp enter secretly; the dull do not enter. It is not suitable for beings; therefore it too is \"unspeakable.\"**

**說三種化他權實為門，利者得入、鈍亦不入，於物非宜，亦不可說。**
**If one speaks the three kinds of Converting-Others Power/Real as a gate: the sharp enter; the dull do not. It is not suitable for beings; therefore it too is \"unspeakable.\"**

**說二種化他權實為門，於利者得入，鈍亦不入，亦不可說，於物非宜。**
**If one speaks the two kinds of Converting-Others Power/Real as a gate: the sharp enter; the dull do not. It too is \"unspeakable\"—it is not suitable for beings.**

**捨三種化他權實，但說自行之權，於利者鈍者俱得入，從始至終以方便為門，是故如來稱歎方便。**
**Discarding the three kinds of Converting-Others Power/Real, and speaking only the provisional [aspect] of Self-Practice: both sharp and dull can enter it. From start to finish, using Expedient Means as the gate—therefore the Tathagata praises Expedient Means.**

**釋品云，方便為入實之門，即此意也。**
**The commentary on this chapter says \"Expedient Means is the gate for entering the Real\"—this is that meaning.**

**前一番，明如來能知方便、能用方便，此一番明行者能隨順方便(云云)。**
**The previous round clarifies that the Tathagata can know expedients and can employ expedients. This round clarifies that the practitioner can accord with expedients (etc.).**

**復次，如來自證修道所得，於一切方便即是真實，而此真實不可得說；雖能說之，眾生不能即實，以方便力，帶不即說一即，利者能即、鈍不能即；又純說一不即，利者密即、鈍者不即；又帶三不即說一即，利者能即、鈍者不即；又帶二不即說一即，利者能即、鈍者不即；又廢三不即，純說一切即，利鈍者俱能即，於方便得見真實。**
**Further: what the Tathagata self-verifies and attains by cultivating the path is \"in every expedient, precisely the real\"—yet this real cannot be spoken. Although it can be spoken, sentient beings cannot immediately be the real. Therefore, by the power of expedients: speaking \"one\" together with \"not-immediately\"—the sharp can immediately [realize], the dull cannot; again, speaking only \"one\" and \"not-immediately\"—the sharp secretly immediately [realize], the dull do not; again, with \"three\" and \"not-immediately\" speaking \"one\" and \"immediately\"—the sharp can, the dull cannot; again, with \"two\" and \"not-immediately\" speaking \"one\" and \"immediately\"—the sharp can, the dull cannot; again, abolishing \"three\" and \"not-immediately,\" and purely speaking \"all are immediately\"—both sharp and dull can immediately [realize], and within expedients they see the real.**

**上兩意用方便從方便，此一意即方便即真實，真實即圓因，圓因即自行之方便，如此自行方便今始證入。**
**The previous two explanations used expedients *from* expedients. This explanation is: expedients are precisely the real. The real is precisely the Perfect Cause; the Perfect Cause is precisely the expedients of Self-Practice. Only now is such Self-Practice expedient being verified/entered.**

**上釋品云，方便者即是真實，從自行方便得名，故言方便品。**
**The earlier explanation of the chapter says: \"Expedients are precisely the real.\" Taking the name from the Self-Practice expedients, therefore it is called the \"Skillful Means\" chapter.**

#### VI. Distinguishing Illumination of the Truths (Fenbie Zhaodi)

**六、分別照諦者，前既通別當分結束權實，今還約此智照義則易見，若通以十種，明自行二智者，即照隨智二諦也；通用十法逗緣者，即照隨情二諦也；若束四為二者，即照隨情智二諦也；若當分照諦者，事理、教行、縛脫、因果悉是自證，即照隨智二諦也；理教、開合此兩屬化他，即照隨情二諦也；體用、漸頓、通別、悉檀四通自他，即照隨情智二諦也。**
**6. Distinguishing illumination of the Truths: Since \"general\" and \"specific\" have already been concluded into Power/Real within their proper scope, now returning to the meaning of wisdom illuminating [the Truths] makes it easy to see. If, in general terms, one uses the ten kinds to clarify the two wisdoms of Self-Practice, that illuminates the two truths \"following wisdom.\" If, in general terms, one uses the ten dharmas to meet conditions, that illuminates the two truths \"following feelings.\" If one bundles four as two, that illuminates the \"following feelings\" and \"following wisdom\" two truths. If, within the proper scope, one illuminates the Truths: Matter/Principle, Teaching/Practice, Bondage/Liberation, and Cause/Effect are all self-verified; thus they illuminate the two truths \"following wisdom.\" Principle/Teaching and Opening/Closing belong to Converting-Others; thus they illuminate the two truths \"following feelings.\" Essence/Function, Gradual/Sudden, General/Specific, and Siddhantas—these four span both self and other; thus they illuminate the \"following feelings\" and \"following wisdom\" two truths.**

**三教照諦準此可解。**
**How the Three Teachings illuminate the Truths can be understood by this guideline.**

**又三藏三十種二智，是化他二智，皆照隨情二諦；若通別六十種，是自他二智，即照隨情智二諦也。**
**Further: the Tripitaka's thirty kinds of two wisdoms are Converting-Others two wisdoms, all illuminating the \"following feelings\" two truths. If [counted as] general+specific sixty kinds, they are Self/Other two wisdoms, thus illuminating the \"following feelings\" and \"following wisdom\" two truths.**

**通教或時與前三藏共為隨情二諦；若圓教三十種權實，是自行二智照隨智二諦。**
**The Shared Teaching sometimes, together with the prior Tripitaka, becomes the \"following feelings\" two truths. But the Perfect Teaching's thirty kinds of Power/Real are the two wisdoms of Self-Practice illuminating the \"following wisdom\" two truths.**

**又三教若通若別，皆是逗緣，悉是化他二智，照隨情二諦；圓教若通若別，皆是自行二智，即照隨智二諦。**
**Further: the three teachings, whether generally or specifically, all meet conditions; they are all Converting-Others two wisdoms illuminating the \"following feelings\" two truths. The Perfect Teaching, whether general or specific, is all Self-Practice two wisdoms illuminating the \"following wisdom\" two truths.**

**若束三教之實為權，束圓教之權為實，即自他二智照隨情智二諦也。**
**If one bundles the \"real\" of the three teachings as Provisional, and bundles the \"provisional\" of the Perfect Teaching as Real, then it is Self/Other two wisdoms illuminating the \"following feelings\" and \"following wisdom\" two truths.**

#### VII. Judging Power/Real According to the Sutras (Yue Zhu Jing)

**七、約諸經者，《華嚴》論教但是滿字，論時但是乳，論法是一自行一化他，若對人但是菩薩，二乘聾啞，生身菩薩亦未能發自行之權、隨智之實；若依今經文，未曾向人說如此事。**
**7. Judging by various sutras: In *Avataṃsaka*, in terms of teaching it is only the Full-Word; in terms of time it is only \"Milk\"; in terms of Dharma it is one Self-Practice and one Converting-Others. If speaking regarding persons, it is only for bodhisattvas: the Two Vehicles are deaf-mute, and bodhisattvas of the \"born body\" have also not yet been able to bring forth the provisional of Self-Practice and the real \"following wisdom.\" If relying on the wording of this sutra, it has never spoken such matters to people.**

**約三藏者，若論教唯是半字，若論法是一種化他，若論時即是酪；若依今文，住立門外著弊垢衣，執除糞器，二乘人耳。**
**Regarding the Tripitaka: in terms of teaching it is only the Half-Word; in terms of Dharma it is one kind of Converting-Others; in terms of time it is \"Curds.\" If relying on this text, they stand outside the gate wearing ragged dirty clothes, holding the dung-scraper—these are people of the Two Vehicles.**

**約方等教，若論教對半論滿，若論時並酪明蘇，若論法有三種化他一種自行；若依今文，心相體信入出無難。**
**Regarding the Vaipulya teachings: in terms of teaching they match Half and Full; in terms of time they are both \"Curds\" and \"Fresh Butter\"; in terms of Dharma there are three kinds of Converting-Others and one kind of Self-Practice. If relying on this text, their minds and marks \"in essence\" believe—entering and exiting are without difficulty.**

**約《般若》，若論教帶半論滿，若依時挾生而熟，若依法則有二種化他一種自行；若依今文，出內取與皆使令知。**
**Regarding Prajñā: in terms of teaching it carries Half and Full; in terms of time it \"holds the raw and ripens\"; in terms of Dharma there are two kinds of Converting-Others and one kind of Self-Practice. If relying on this text, both \"bringing out and taking in\" and \"giving and taking\" are all made known.**

**約《法華》，論教廢半論滿，若論時純是醍醐，若論法唯有自行；若依今文開權顯實，此實我子我之所生我實是父，付以家業授記作佛。**
**Regarding the *Lotus*: in terms of teaching it abolishes Half and speaks Full; in terms of time it is purely \"Ghee\"; in terms of Dharma there is only Self-Practice. If relying on this text's opening the provisional and revealing the real: \"This is truly my child, born of me; I am truly the father\"—entrusting the family business and bestowing prediction of Buddhahood.**

**前教不說者，今皆發之，正直捨方便，但說無上道，故是自行之權，故言方便品。自餘或是自他二智，或化他二智。**
**What the former teachings did not speak, now all is disclosed. \"Straightforwardly abandoning expedients, only speaking the unsurpassed path\"—therefore it is the provisional of Self-Practice, hence it is called the Skillful Means chapter. The remainder is either Self/Other two wisdoms or Converting-Others two wisdoms.**

**復次《華嚴》對二菩薩，說一自一他，不擬二乘不聞不解。**
**Further: *Avataṃsaka* addresses two kinds of bodhisattvas, speaking one Self and one Other, not intending the Two Vehicles (who do not hear and do not understand).**

**三藏對二乘說一化他，不擬菩薩故無自行。**
**The Tripitaka addresses the Two Vehicles, speaking one Converting-Others; it does not intend bodhisattvas, therefore it lacks Self-Practice.**

**方等具對小大，對二乘，說兩化他，對菩薩說一自一他。**
**The Vaipulya teachings address both small and great: to the Two Vehicles they speak two Converting-Others; to bodhisattvas they speak one Self and one Other.**

**《般若》亦對三，說一自二他，對二乘說一他，對菩薩說一自一他。**
**Prajñā likewise addresses three [types], speaking one Self and two Others; to the Two Vehicles it speaks one Other; to bodhisattvas it speaks one Self and one Other.**

**《法華》普對機熟者，但明一自不復論他。**
**The *Lotus* universally addresses those whose capacities are mature; it only clarifies one Self and no longer discusses Other.**

**文云：「菩薩聞是法，疑網皆已除。千二百羅漢，悉亦當作佛。」一切眾生悉入自行之方便，故言方便品(云云)。**
**The text says: \"When bodhisattvas hear this Dharma, their net of doubts is already removed. The twelve hundred arhats will all become Buddhas.\" All sentient beings enter the expedients of Self-Practice; therefore it is called the Skillful Means chapter (etc.).**

#### VIII. Judging Power/Real According to Trace and Origin (Yue Ben-Ji)

**八、本迹者，如來本地久已證得一切權實，名為自行；中間垂迹亦作兼帶等說，今日垂迹寂滅道場，帶別化他說自行，次說一化他，次說三，次說二，次說廢三等，皆名化他權實，束本權名實，束迹實名權，即是自他權實也。**
**8. Trace and Origin: The Tathagata in the original ground long ago verified all Power/Real—this is named Self-Practice. In the interim, in descending traces, He also speaks in \"combining\" and \"carrying\" ways. Today, in the descending trace of the tranquil Bodhimanda, He carries the Distinct [Teaching] Converting-Others while speaking Self-Practice; next He speaks one Converting-Others; next He speaks three; next He speaks two; next He speaks abolishing three; and so on—these are all named Converting-Others Power/Real. Bundling the provisional of the Origin as Real, and bundling the real of the Trace as Provisional—this is Self/Other Power/Real.**

**結此則有四句：一切實、一切權，一切亦權亦實，一切非權非實(云云)。**
**Concluding this, there are four phrases: all real; all provisional; all both provisional and real; all neither provisional nor real (etc.).**

**身子本證一切權實即自行，迹在鹿苑單受化他，在方等受一被三折，在《般若》帶二轉一，至《法華》廢三悟一，皆是化他權實，束本權為實，束迹實為權，即自他權實，亦具四句(云云)。**
**Śāriputra, in the Origin, verifies all Power/Real—this is Self-Practice. In traces: at Deer Park he receives only Converting-Others; in Vaipulya he receives \"one\" while being broken by \"three\"; in Prajñā he carries \"two\" and turns to \"one\"; reaching the *Lotus* he abolishes \"three\" and awakens to \"one\"—all these are Converting-Others Power/Real. Bundling the provisional of the Origin as Real and bundling the real of the Trace as Provisional is precisely Self/Other Power/Real; it also includes the four phrases (etc.).**

**若從佛迹說，亦是化他之權實，亦稱方便品；若從引入圓因自行，亦是方便品；若從身子迹權，亦是方便品；若從身子迹入實，亦是方便品；為此諸義故稱方便品也。**
**If speaking from the Buddha's traces, it is also Converting-Others Power/Real, and is also called the Skillful Means chapter. If speaking from drawing [beings] into the Perfect Cause Self-Practice, it is also the Skillful Means chapter. If speaking from Śāriputra's trace-provisional, it is also the Skillful Means chapter. If speaking from Śāriputra's trace entering the real, it is also the Skillful Means chapter. For all these meanings, it is therefore called the Skillful Means chapter.**

### 3. The Main Discourse Division (Lines 236-275)

**○從此品下，訖〈分別功德品〉十九行偈，或至偈後現在四信弟子文盡，名為正說分。**
**From this chapter down to the 19 verses of the *Distinctions in Merit Chapter*, or up to the end of the text on the "Four Faiths of Disciples in the Present," is named the Main Discourse Division (*Zhengshuo Fen*).**

**若作兩正說，從此下訖〈授學無學人記品〉，是迹門正說。**
**If making "Two Main Discourses" [Trace and Origin], then from here down to the *Prophecies for Learners and Adepts Chapter* is the Trace Gate Main Discourse.**

**今且逐近，就迹門正說更為兩：一、從此下，是略開三顯一；二、從「告舍利弗汝已殷勤」下，是廣開三顯一。**
**Now, pursuing the immediate context, within the Trace Gate Main Discourse, we further divide it into two: 1. From here downwards is the "Brief Opening of the Three to Reveal the One." 2. From "I tell Sariputra, you have already been earnest [requesting]" is the "Wide Opening of the Three to Reveal the One."**

**○略更為二：初、從「爾時世尊」下，是略開三顯一；二、從「爾時大眾」下，是動執生疑。**
**The "Brief Opening" is further divided into two: 1. From "At that time the World Honored One" is the Brief Opening of the Three to Reveal the One. 2. From "At that time the Great Assembly" is Shaking Attachments and Birthing Doubts.**

**略開三顯一，有長行、偈頌。長行為二：一、寄言歎二智；二、絕言歎二智。**
**The Brief Opening has prose and verses. The prose has two parts: 1. Praising the Two Wisdoms via Words (*Jiyan*). 2. Praising the Two Wisdoms transcending Words (*Jueyan*).**

**若不措言則無能知者，雖復稱揚言不能盡，諸佛二智如前說(云云)。**
**If one does not employ words, no one can know it; although one praises it, words cannot exhaust it. The Two Wisdoms of all Buddhas are as explained before (etc.).**

**寄言為二：一、明諸佛權實；二、明釋迦權實。**
**Praising via Words has two parts: 1. Clarifying the Power/Real of All Buddhas; 2. Clarifying the Power/Real of Shakyamuni.**

**諸佛道同是故俱歎，上光照他土，彌勒橫問，文殊引古，大眾豎聞，正表於此，故發軫定起，即明諸佛道同也。**
**The Way of all Buddhas is identical, therefore they are praised together. Previously, the Light shone on other lands, Maitreya asked horizontally, Manjushri cited the ancient vertically, and the Great Assembly heard it vertically—perfectly expressing this. Thus, rising from samadhi signifies the identity of the Buddha-Way.**

**就歎諸佛文為三：一、雙歎；二、雙釋；三、雙結。**
**Praising All Buddhas has three parts: 1. Double Praise; 2. Double Explanation; 3. Double Conclusion.**

**就雙歎中，先、經家提起；次、正歎。**
**Within Double Praise: First, the Sutra Compiler brings it up; Next, the Main Praise.**

**「爾時」者，當爾之時也，**
**"At that time" (*Ershi*) means exactly at that time.**

**佛常在定，何故言起？此有所示。**
**The Buddha is constantly in Samadhi; why does it say "Rise"? This has a demonstration.**

**往古諸佛說此經時，必前入無量義即入法華，今佛亦爾，此示世界悉檀哀從定起；**
**Ancient Buddhas, when speaking this Sutra, necessarily first entered *Immeasurable Meanings* then entered *Lotus*. The present Buddha is also like this. This demonstrates the Worldly Siddhāntas, compassionately rising from Samadhi.**

**履歷法緣二俱審諦，說必不謬增長物信，此示為人悉檀哀從定起；**
**Reviewing the Dharma and Conditions, both being thoroughly examined, the speech will definitely not be erroneous, increasing beings' faith. This demonstrates the Individual Siddhānta, compassionately rising from Samadhi.**

**佛寂而常照，尚須入定方乃說法，況復散心妄有所說，此是對治悉檀哀從定起；**
**The Buddha is quiescent yet constantly shining. If He still must enter Samadhi before speaking Dharma, how much more so [should we avoid] speaking falsely with a scattered mind? This demonstrates the Counteractive Siddhānta, compassionately rising from Samadhi.**

**入定緣理安心實相，出定令他安心實相，此是第一義悉檀哀從定起。**
**Entering Samadhi focuses on Principle, resting the mind in the Real Mark. Exiting Samadhi causes others to rest their minds in the Real Mark. This demonstrates the Primary Meaning Siddhānta, compassionately rising from Samadhi.**

**安此四法故言「安詳而起」也。**
**Established in these four dharmas, thus it says "Serenely and quietly arose" (*Anxiang er qi*).**

**「告舍利弗」者，小乘中智慧第一，將欲因其破小智、顯大智，廢會開覆凡十種，如《玄義》中說，此乃經家提起之文。**
**"Told Sariputra": He is foremost in wisdom among the Small Vehicle. [The Buddha] intends to use him to break small wisdom and reveal Great Wisdom. This is the text raised by the Sutra Compiler.**

**《法華論》云：「佛入甚深三昧正念不動，如實智觀，從三昧而起，現如來得自在力故，如來入定無能驚忤故。」**
**The *Lotus Sutra Treatise* says: "The Buddha entered the very profound samadhi, right mindfulness unmoving; with true-as-it-is wisdom he contemplated; he arose from samadhi. Because the Tathagata manifests the power of sovereignty, there is none who can startle or disturb the Tathagata while he is in samadhi."**

**《論》與今義相應，第(一義)悉檀出過世間，故無能驚忤，四悉檀無障礙，故得自在(云云)。**
**The Treatise accords with the present meaning: the Primary Meaning Siddhānta transcends the world, therefore none can startle/disturb; the Four Siddhāntas are unobstructed, therefore sovereignty is obtained (etc.).**

**「加趺坐」者，古往微塵恒沙諸佛及弟子盡行此法故。**
**As for "sitting cross-legged": in ancient times, Buddhas and disciples as numerous as dust-motes and sands all practiced this method.**

**又加趺起惡覺，尚生他敬心，況入深境界而不適悅天人耶？**
**Further, sitting cross-legged stops evil thoughts and still gives rise to others' respectful minds—how much more so when entering a deep realm, would it not delight devas and humans?**

**又非世受用法，不與外道共，能破魔軍煩惱故，又能生三種菩提道故，私謂此是四悉檀意也。**
**Further, it is not a worldly \"enjoyment\" dharma and is not shared with outsiders. It can break Māra's army of afflictions, and can give rise to the three kinds of bodhi-path. I privately say: this is the meaning of the Four Siddhāntas.**

**問：**

**Question:**

**餘經云：「繫念在前」者，云何？**

**Other sutras say \"fasten mindfulness upon what is in front\"—what does this mean?**

**答：**

**Answer:**

**背色想生死煩惱境界在後故，觀寂滅涅槃所緣在前，故應作四解(云云)。**

**Because the object-realm of turning away from form-perception, birth-and-death, and afflictions is \"behind\"; and the contemplative object of quiescent-extinction nirvana is \"in front\"; therefore one should make four explanations (etc.).**

**問：**

**Question:**

**云何在面？**

**How is it \"upon the face\"?**

**答：**

**Answer:**

**凡人於面起欲能生猗樂，然後遍身。又九處流穢，面有七孔，以不淨治欲，故繫緣在面(其一)。又六識在面，心多上緣，表一切賢聖尚空與空相應故，繫緣在面(其二)。又若觀於面則能分別六識，為分別故故繫緣在面(其三)。又身有六分，頭面為勝，表諸法中實相第一，第一法故繫緣在面(其四)。**

**For ordinary people, desire arising at the face can generate delight, and then spreads throughout the body. Further, the nine places flow with filth; the face has seven apertures. Using impurity to treat desire, therefore the object is fastened on the face (first). Further, the six consciousnesses are on the face; the mind mostly conditions upward—indicating that all sages still accord with emptiness and with the mark of emptiness; therefore the object is fastened on the face (second). Further, if one contemplates the face, one can discriminate the six consciousnesses; because it is for discrimination, therefore the object is fastened on the face (third). Further, the body has six parts; head and face are supreme—indicating that among all dharmas, the Real Mark is first. Because it is the first dharma, therefore the object is fastened on the face (fourth).**

### The Double Praise of Two Wisdoms

**就雙歎二智，先歎實，次歎權。**
**Regarding Double Praise of Two Wisdoms: First praising Real, next praising Provisional.**

**實者諸佛智慧也，非三種化他權實故言諸佛，顯自行之實故言智慧，此智慧體即一心三智。**
**Real: This is "The Wisdom of All Buddhas." It is not the three types of Converting-Others Power/Real, hence "All Buddhas." It reveals the Real of Self-Practice, hence "Wisdom." The essence of this Wisdom is the One Mind Three Wisdoms (*Yixin Sanzhi*). [^5]**

**「甚深無量」者，即稱歎之辭也。明佛實智豎徹如理之底故言甚深，橫窮法界之邊故言無量，**
**"Extremely Profound and Measureless": These are words of praise. It clarifies that the Buddha's Real Wisdom vertically penetrates the bottom of Principle (Profound) and horizontally exhausts the edges of the Dharma Realm (Measureless).**

**無量甚深深高橫廣，譬如根深則條茂、源遠則流長，實智既然，權智例爾(云云)。**
**Measureless and profound—deep-high and horizontal-vast—are like: if roots are deep, branches flourish; if sources are far, streams are long. Since Real Wisdom is so, Provisional Wisdom is likewise (etc.).**

**「其智慧門」即是歎權智也，蓋是自行道前方便，有進趣之力故名為門，從門入到道中，道中稱實、道前謂權也。**
**"Its Wisdom Gate": This praises Provisional Wisdom. It is the Expedient Means before the Path of Self-Practice. It has the power of progress/entry, hence named "Gate." From the Gate one enters the Path. Inside the Path is called Real; before the Path is called Provisional.**

**「難解難入」者，歎權之辭也。**
**"Difficult to understand and difficult to enter": Words praising Provisional Wisdom.**

**不謀而了，無方大用，七種方便不能測度，十住始解，十地為入，舉初與後，中間難示，難悟可知，而別舉聲聞、緣覺所不能知者，執重故別破之耳。**
**Without deliberation it understands; without method it has great function. The seven kinds of expedients cannot measure it. The Ten Abodes begin to understand; the Ten Grounds are entry. Citing the first and the last, the middle is hard to show; its difficulty to awaken is thus known. It specifically cites \"voice-hearers\" and \"pratyekabuddhas\" as unable to know only because their attachments are heavy—therefore it breaks them specifically.**

**法身本意元以自行權實擬之，無機逃走故言不知；**
**The Dharma-Body's fundamental intent originally uses the Self-Practice Power/Real as its analogue. Because those without capacity flee, it says \"do not know.\"**

**《華嚴》頓照，聾啞瞽聵故言不知；**
**In *Avataṃsaka*, [the Buddha] illuminates suddenly; they are deaf-mute and blind-deaf, therefore it says \"do not know.\"**

**《方等》彈斥保住草庵故言不知；**
**In Vaipulya, [the Buddha] reproaches and rebukes; they cling to their grass-hut, therefore it says \"do not know.\"**

**《般若》轉教無心悕取一飱之意故言不知；**
**In Prajñā, [the Buddha] turns the teaching; they have no mind that hopes to grasp even a single meal—therefore it says \"do not know.\"**

**今大機啟發放光動地，彼此今古諸佛道同，由懷疑惑故言不知。**
**Now, great capacities are stimulated and brought forth, emitting light and shaking the earth; present and ancient, here and there, the Buddha-way is the same—yet because they harbor doubts, it says \"do not know.\"**

**利根菩薩節節能知，鈍同二乘是亦不知也。**
**Sharp-rooted bodhisattvas can know step by step. The dull are like the Two Vehicles—these too do not know.**

**「門」者，光宅取二乘方便為今經智慧門，此須與奪。**
**As for \"gate\": Guangzhai takes the Two Vehicles' expedients as the \"wisdom gate\" of this sutra. This requires granting or rejecting.**

**若爾即是得門，云何如來破言不知？不知者則非門也。**
**If that were so, they would have obtained the gate—then how could the Tathagata refute them by saying \"do not know\"? If they do not know, then it is not a gate.**

**與者，此是最淺之能永不識所(云云)。**
**If one were to grant it: this would be the shallowest—yet one could forever not recognize what it is (etc.).**

**今解自有方便智慧為門，得入佛智慧，如《瓔珞》云：「二觀為方便道，得入中道第一義諦。」**
**Now I explain: it is one's own expedient wisdom that is the gate, by which one enters the Buddha's wisdom. As the *Yingluo* says: \"The Two Contemplations are the expedient path, by which one enters the Middle Way Primary Meaning Truth.\"**

**亦是三教各各有四門，為方便得入中道。**
**Likewise, the three teachings each have their own four gates, as expedients by which one enters the Middle Way.**

**光宅之解於二觀中秖是一觀，於十二門秖是一門(云云)。**
**Guangzhai's interpretation makes the Two Contemplations into only one contemplation, and the Twelve Gates into only one gate (etc.).**

**又方便智慧為門，得入方便智，即是三教各各四門齊教入證也。**
**Further: taking expedient wisdom as the gate, one enters \"expedient wisdom\"—this is the three teachings each, through their four gates, entering realization according to their own teaching.**

**自有佛智為門得入佛智慧，如上說圓因稱方便品，即是自行觀智為門，即是今經所歎其智慧門，圓教四門即其一也，**
**Taking the Buddha's own wisdom as the gate, one enters the Buddha's wisdom. As stated above, the Perfect Cause calls it the Skillful Means chapter: taking the Self-Practice contemplative wisdom as the gate—this is the \"wisdom gate\" praised in this sutra; the Perfect Teaching's four gates are precisely one of these.**

**自有實為門入方便智雙照二諦，即其義也。**
**Taking the Real as the gate, one enters expedient wisdom that doubly illuminates the two truths—this is its meaning.**

**如此釋者豐富開闊，何如光宅區區一種耶？**
**Such an explanation is rich and expansive—how could it compare to Guangzhai's petty single-type [reading]?**

**若依論以阿含為門，此須開拓諸教，準觀可知(云云)。**
**If, relying on the Treatise, one takes the Agamas as the gate, one must broaden and open out the various teachings; by analogy and contemplation it can be known (etc.).**

**從「所以者何」下，光宅云：「歎釋迦章」。今推文意，是雙釋諸佛二智也。**
**From "Why is this so?" downwards, Guangzhai says this praises Shakyamuni. Now inferring the text's intent, it is the Double Explanation of All Buddhas' Two Wisdoms.**

**「佛曾親近」至「盡行道法」，是釋諸佛實智，**
**"The Buddha has intimately approached [numberless Buddhas]" up to "exhaustively practiced the Way-dharmas" explains All Buddhas' Real Wisdom.**

**良由外值佛多，稟承至要故，實智甚深；良由內行純厚盡行道法故，實智無量。無量則釋橫廣，甚深則釋豎高也。**
**This is because: outwardly, He encountered many Buddhas and received their essential teachings—therefore the Real Wisdom is \"profound.\" Inwardly, His practice was pure and abundant and he exhaustively practiced the way-dharmas—therefore the Real Wisdom is \"measureless.\" \"Measureless\" explains horizontal vastness; \"profound\" explains vertical height.**

**「勇猛精進名稱普聞」，是釋諸佛權智。**
**"Courageous and energetic, name and fame universally heard" explains All Buddhas' Provisional Wisdom.**

**「其智慧門難解難入」，良由勇猛精進能入難入之門，既入門已澤被無疆物欽勝德，故名稱普聞。**
**\"Its wisdom-gate is hard to understand and hard to enter\": because courageous vigor can enter that which is hard to enter. Once having entered the gate, one's beneficence spreads without bounds, and beings admire the superior virtue—therefore the name is universally heard.**

**亦可分句，「勇猛精進」能入法門，即釋權智深，「名稱普聞」即釋權智廣；觀權文無深廣之語，例實智此義則成(云云)。**
**One can also split the phrase: \"courageous and vigorous\"—able to enter the Dharma gate—explains the profundity of Provisional Wisdom; \"name universally heard\" explains its breadth. Although the Provisional text does not use the words \"deep\" and \"broad,\" by analogy with Real Wisdom, this meaning is established (etc.).**

**從「成就甚深」下，雙結諸佛二智。**
**From "Perfecting the extremely profound [Dharma]" downwards, is the Double Conclusion of All Buddhas' Two Wisdoms.**

**稱理究竟故言成就，到彼岸底故言甚深，此結成實智也；**
**According with Principle to the ultimate, hence "Perfecting." Reaching the bottom of the Other Shore, hence "Extremely Profound." This concludes the Real Wisdom.**

**稱機適會故言隨宜，非七方便所知故言難解，此結成權智也。**
**According with Capacities (*Ji*) and fitting the meeting, hence "In accordance with what is appropriate" (*Suiyi*). Not known by the Seven Expedients, hence "Difficult to understand." This concludes the Provisional Wisdom.**

**隨情則翳理，故言難解；了義故意顯，故言易知。**
**Following feelings obscures Principle; therefore it says \"hard to understand.\" Because it is definitive meaning, its intent is manifest; therefore it says \"easy to know.\"**

**《攝大乘》云：「了義經依文判義，不了義經依義判文」，即斯義也。**
**The *Mahāyānasaṃgraha* says: \"For definitive-meaning sutras, rely on the text to judge the meaning. For non-definitive-meaning sutras, rely on the meaning to judge the text\"—this is that meaning.**

**有時解「成就甚深未曾有法」，結自行權實，「隨宜所說意趣難解」，結化他權實(云云)。**
**Sometimes it is explained that \"accomplishing the profoundly deep, unprecedented Dharma\" concludes the Self-Practice Power/Real, and \"in accordance with what is appropriate, the purport is hard to understand\" concludes the Converting-Others Power/Real (etc.).**

**從「吾從成佛已來」者，是歎釋迦權實。**
**From "Since I became Buddha" is the Praise of Shakyamuni's Power/Real.**

**舊云釋迦權實各各歎，謂「吾從成佛」下，是歎權，「所以者何」是釋權；「如來知見廣大」下，是歎實，從「無量無礙」下，是釋實；從「如來能種種分別」下，是結歎實文。**
**The old [commentators] say that Shakyamuni's provisional/real are praised separately: from \"Since I became Buddha\" downward is praising the provisional; \"Why is this so\" explains the provisional; from \"The Tathagata's knowledge and vision is broad\" downward is praising the real; from \"measureless and unobstructed\" downward explains the real; from \"The Tathagata can make various discriminations\" downward is the concluding praise of the real.**

**舊料揀前後有三意：一、合歎諸佛二智者，明二智體同，開歎釋迦二智者，明二智功用有異；**
**The old analysis selecting front and back has three intentions. First: \"uniting\" the praise of all Buddhas' two wisdoms clarifies that the substance of the two wisdoms is the same; \"separating\" the praise of Shakyamuni's two wisdoms clarifies that the functions of the two wisdoms differ.**

**二、明垂迹之本，故諸佛先歎實，明顯本之能，故釋迦先歎權；**
**Second: to clarify the Origin of the descending traces, therefore \"all Buddhas\" first praise the real; to manifest the power of the Origin, therefore Shakyamuni first praises the provisional.**

**三、諸佛顯自行，先須得實，釋迦明化他，先以權引童蒙，而互現出沒者，將明體圓不可偏存，存則失旨也。**
**Third: all Buddhas reveal Self-Practice, and thus must first obtain the real. Shakyamuni clarifies Converting Others, and thus first uses the provisional to guide the childish and ignorant. Their mutually appearing \"emerging\" and \"withdrawing\" is to clarify that the substance is perfect and cannot be retained on one side; to retain one side is to miss the intent.**

**今謂不爾，但依文次第於義易解，不須曲辯。**
**Now I say it is not so. Simply rely on the text's sequence; the meaning is easy to understand—there is no need for tortuous argumentation.**

**又汝云諸佛道同，云何異解？如人善讚孝順而打擲父母(云云)。**
**Moreover, you say the Buddha-way is the same for all Buddhas—so how can you give a different interpretation? It is like a person who praises filial piety well and yet beats and throws down his parents (etc.).**

**就釋迦文亦為三：初、雙歎；次、雙釋；後、雙結。**
**Regarding the Shakyamuni passage, it is also in three parts: first, the Double Praise; second, the Double Explanation; third, the Double Conclusion.**

**「吾從成佛已來」歎實智。**
**"Since I became Buddha" praises Real Wisdom.**

**若實智不圓佛道不成，既云成佛，一成一切成，即是歎實智也。**
**If Real Wisdom were not perfect, the Buddha Way would not be accomplished. Since it says "Became Buddha," one accomplishment implies all accomplishments; thus it praises Real Wisdom.**

**「種種因緣」下，是歎權智。**
**"Various causes and conditions" praises Provisional Wisdom.**

**四十餘年以三種化他權實逗會眾生，故言種種因緣也。**
**For over forty years, meeting sentient beings with the three types of Converting-Others Power/Real; hence "Various causes and conditions."**

**「譬喻」者，小乘中以芭蕉、水沫為譬，大乘中以乾城、鏡幻等譬。**
**"Similes": In the Hinayana, banana tree and water-bubbles are used as similes; in the Mahayana, a dry (gandharva) city, mirror-illusions, and the like are used as similes.**

**依諸論者以小乘譬乳，大乘譬醍醐也。**
**According to the treatises, the Hinayana is likened to milk; the Mahayana is likened to ghee.**

**「廣演」者，能於一法出無量義也。**
**"Broadly expounding": being able, from a single dharma, to bring forth immeasurable meanings.**

**「無數方便」者，即七種方便也。**
**"Countless expedient means": that is, the seven kinds of expedients.**

**「引導眾生令離諸著」者，說散十善離三途著，說淨十善離欲界著，說三藏離見思著，說菩薩法離涅槃著，說佛法離順道法愛著。**
**"Guiding sentient beings so that they depart from all attachments": preaching the scattered ten good [deeds] to depart from attachment to the three evil paths; preaching the purified ten good [deeds] to depart from attachment to the desire realm; preaching the Tripitaka [teaching] to depart from attachment to view-and-thought delusions; preaching the bodhisattva Dharma to depart from attachment to nirvana; preaching the Buddha Dharma to depart from attachment to love/attachment for dharmas that accord with the path.**

**從「所以者何」，是雙釋二智也。**
**From "Why is this so?" is the Double Explanation of the Two Wisdoms.**

**如來半句即是釋實智，從真如實相中來而得成佛道，故名如來，即釋成實智也；**
**The half-sentence "Tathāgata" explains Real Wisdom. Coming from *Tathātā* (True Suchness/Real Mark) and attaining the Buddha Way, hence named "Thus Come One" (*Tathāgata*). This explains Real Wisdom.**

**方便即是釋權智；**
**"Expedient Means" (*Upāya*) explains Provisional Wisdom.**

**由於方便善巧故能種種因緣知見波羅蜜者，即是雙舉權實知見也。**
**Because of convenient skill-in-means, being able to [use] various causes/conditions [to teach] "Knowledge and Vision Paramita": this brings up both Power and Real Knowledge/Vision.**

**一切種智名實知，佛眼名實見；道種智名權知，法眼名權見，悉到事理邊故，悉名波羅蜜。**
**All-Mode Wisdom is named Real Knowing; the Buddha-eye is named Real Seeing. Path Wisdom is named Provisional Knowing; the Dharma-eye is named Provisional Seeing. Because they fully reach the boundary of events and principle, all are named paramita.**

**「皆已具足」者，權實悉究竟也。**
**"All are already complete": provisional and real are both ultimate.**

**若不作雙釋之意，那忽言皆已？**
**If one does not take this as a double explanation, why would it suddenly say "all are already"?**

**皆已者雙釋意顯也。**
**The phrase "all are already" makes the double-explanation intent manifest.**

**從「如來知見廣大深遠」，即是雙結釋迦二智也。**
**From "The Tathāgata's Knowledge and Vision is broad, great, deep, and far," is the Double Conclusion of Shakyamuni's Two Wisdoms.**

**如來知見如前說，廣大明橫、深遠明豎，如此實智非橫非豎，寄言往歎論其橫豎照無限極，如函大、蓋大也。**
**The Tathāgata's knowledge and vision, as explained above: \"broad and great\" clarifies the horizontal; \"deep and far\" clarifies the vertical. Such Real Wisdom is neither horizontal nor vertical—yet using words to praise it, we discuss its horizontal/vertical illumination as limitless-extreme, like: the case is great and the lid is great.**

**「無量無礙」下，即是結權智也。**
**From "Measureless, Unobstructed" concludes Provisional Wisdom.**

**自行之權，道前方便，約諸法門，故知是結權智明矣；實智無若干也。**
**The provisional of Self-Practice is the expedients \"before the path\" and is spoken in terms of various Dharma gates—therefore it is clear this concludes Provisional Wisdom. Real Wisdom has no such \"many kinds.\"**

**光宅以此釋實智，非但光宅不識實智，梁代皆不知其無礙慧無若干也(云云)。**
**Guangzhai uses this to explain Real Wisdom. It is not only Guangzhai who does not recognize Real Wisdom; in the Liang dynasty, all did not know that unobstructed wisdom has no \"many kinds\" (etc.).**

**「無量」即佛地四等也，「無礙」即佛地四辯也。**
**\"Measureless\" is the four equalities on the Buddha-ground; \"unobstructed\" is the four kinds of eloquence on the Buddha-ground.**

**能於一辭一義，旋出無量樂說不窮，比於別通菩薩，如甲上土方地。**
**With a single phrase or a single meaning, one can immediately produce immeasurable joyous preaching without exhaustion. Compared to Distinct/Shared bodhisattvas, it is like the upper arm compared to the square ground.**

**「力」即十力，「畏」即四無所畏，「禪」盡禪之實相，「定」即首楞嚴定，「三昧」即王三昧，「深入無際」者，結成豎深，「成就一切未曾有法」，結成橫廣。**
**\"Powers\" are the Ten Powers. \"Fearlessnesses\" are the Four Fearlessnesses. \"Dhyānas\" are the Real Mark of exhausting dhyāna. \"Concentration\" is the Śūraṃgama Samādhi. \"Samādhi\" is the King Samādhi. \"Penetrating deeply without limit\" concludes the vertical depth. \"Accomplishing all unprecedented dharmas\" concludes the horizontal breadth.**

**從「舍利弗如來能種種分別」下，舊將結成前權實；今用起後將欲絕言，更舉權實為絕歎之由。**
**From "Sariputra, the Tathāgata is able to make various distinctions" Old interpretations take this to conclude the previous Power/Real. Now we use it to start the later section; intending to Transcend Words (*Jueyan*), we again bring up Power/Real as the cause for the "Praise Transcending Words."**

**文為二：初、舉絕歎之由；次、指絕言之境。**
**The text has two parts: first, raising the basis for the praise that transcends words; second, pointing to the realm that transcends words.**

**鄭重者表殷勤也，「如來能善分別、巧說諸法」者，即舉權也。**
**\"With weight and emphasis\" indicates earnestness. \"The Tathāgata can skillfully discriminate and cleverly speak the dharmas\" raises the provisional.**

**「言辭柔軟悅可眾心」者，舉實也。**
**\"His words are gentle, pleasing the hearts of the assembly\" raises the real.**

**何以得知？上見他土說頓云：「其聲清淨出柔軟音」下，身子領解云：「聞佛柔軟音深遠甚微妙」，據前後兩文，知是舉實智也。**
**How do we know? Above, when seeing that other land preaching the Sudden, it says \"its voice is pure, producing gentle sounds.\" Below, Śāriputra's understanding says \"hearing the Buddha's gentle voice, deep, far, extremely subtle and wondrous.\" Based on these earlier and later passages, we know this raises Real Wisdom.**

**前歎中，前實後權，今何意前權後實？明前欲寄言故從實而舒權，今欲絕言須卷權歸實耳。**
**In the earlier praise, Real came first and Provisional came after. Now why is Provisional first and Real after? It clarifies: earlier, wanting to \"praise via words,\" it unfolded the provisional from the real. Now, wanting to transcend words, it must roll up the provisional and return it to the real.**

**從「取要言之」，是指實境，要者莫過于實也；「無量無邊未曾有法」是指權境。**
**From \"to take the essential point\": this points to the real realm—nothing is more essential than the real. \"Measureless, boundless, unprecedented dharmas\" points to the provisional realm.**

**又「舉要」是創指之端，「無量無邊」是指權，「未曾有法」是指實，言此二法佛悉成就，修道得故，此那可說？**
**Further: \"raising the essential\" is the initial beginning of pointing; \"measureless and boundless\" points to the provisional; \"unprecedented dharmas\" points to the real. It says: the Buddha has perfected these two dharmas and attained them by cultivating the path—how could that be spoken?**

**若單明一事，不應言悉，既雙指權實，其意明矣。**
**If it clarified only a single matter, it should not say \"all.\" Since it points to both provisional and real, its intent is clear.**

---

### 4. Praise Transcending Words (Jueyan Tan) (Lines 276-End)

**「止」者下，第二，即絕言歎也。**
**From "Stop" downwards is the Second part: Praise Transcending Words (*Jueyan Tan*).**

**印師云：「欲因止生其疑請之心也。」**
**Dharma Master Yin says: "Intending to use 'Stop' to generate the mind of doubt and request."**

**觀師云：「實法難知，故先抑止，驚其常情。」**
**Dharma Master Guan says: "The Real Dharma is difficult to know; thus first suppressing/stopping it to startle their ordinary feelings."**

**今明此法深寂言語道斷，體不可說，故止而歎之。**
**Now we clarify: This Dharma is deeply quiescent; the path of language is cut off. The Essence cannot be spoken; therefore, He stops and [thereby] praises it.**

**設慈悲為說，聞不能解，傷其善根，是故止也。**
**If, out of compassion, He were to speak it, hearing it they would not understand, injuring their roots of goodness. Therefore, He stops.**

**從「所以者何」下，是釋止歎之意。**
**From "Why is this so?" downwards explains the intention of "Stopping and Praising."**

**意為兩：一、就佛是最上人成就，修得最上法，故不可說；**
**The meaning is twofold: 1. Regarding the Buddha as the Supreme Person perfecting it, cultivating and obtaining the Supreme Dharma, therefore it cannot be spoken.**

**次、明甚深境界不可思議，故不可說。**
**2. Clarifying the Extremely Profound Boundary [State] is inconceivable, therefore it cannot be spoken.**

**就「佛成就」下，明上人權實橫滿不可說；**
**Regarding "The Buddha has perfected [the foremost, rare Dharma]" downwards: clarifying the Supreme Person's Power/Real is Horizontally Complete (*Heng Man*) and cannot be spoken.**

**從「唯佛與佛」下，明上人權實豎深不可說。**
**From "Only a Buddha and a Buddha" downwards: clarifying the Supreme Person's Power/Real is Vertically Profound (*Shu Shen*) and cannot be spoken.**

**成就對不成就，乃至難解對不難解，即是橫明成就，修道得故，故不可說。**
**"Perfected" vs "Not Perfected," up to "Difficult to Understand" vs "Not Difficult"—this clarifies perfection horizontally. Because it is obtained through cultivation, it cannot be spoken.**

**「唯佛與佛乃能究盡」者，初中分獲，未盡其源，如十四日月，光用未普；**
**"Only a Buddha and a Buddha can exhaustively fathom it": The initial and middle [stages] partially obtain it but do not exhaust its source; like the moon on the 14th day, its light and function are not yet universal.**

**獨佛與佛究竟邊底，如十五日之月，體無不圓、光無不遍，如此豎深，修道得故，故不可說。**
**Only a Buddha and a Buddha exhaust the boundaries and bottom; like the moon on the 15th day, its essence is perfectly round, its light is all-pervading. Being vertically profound like this, obtained through cultivation, therefore it cannot be spoken.**

**從「諸法實相」下，即是甚深境界不可思議，故不可說。**
**From "The Real Mark of all dharmas" downwards clarifies the Extremely Profound Boundary is inconceivable, thus unspeakable.**

**光宅云：「初一句標二智章，諸法標權智境。」三三非一故言諸法，三法之中其教最顯，教必逗機仍有其人，故知三三是權也。**
**Guangzhai says: "The first sentence marks the Two Wisdoms chapter, 'All Dharmas' marks the Provisional Wisdom Boundary." [He argues] the "Three Threes" are not one, thus "All Dharmas." Within the three dharmas, the teaching is most obvious, and the teaching must accord with capacities and still have its people; thus it is known that the Three Threes are Provisional. (Zhiyi cites this to refute).**

**實相者是實智境，一理非虛故言實相，四一之中遍舉一理，理是本故，故是實也。**
**"Real Mark" is the Real Wisdom Boundary. The One Principle is not false, hence "Real Mark." Within the "Four Ones," it strictly brings up the One Principle, because Principle is the Root; thus it is Real.**

**中有九句，還釋上兩章耳。前五句釋權章。**
**Within [the text] there are nine sentences, returning to explain the previous two chapters. The first five sentences explain the Provisional Chapter.**

**「如是相」者，三乘言教攬而可別也；**
**"Such a Mark": The verbal teachings of the Three Vehicles can be grasped and distinguished.**

**「如是性」者，三乘教性分不可移易也；**
**"Such a Nature": The nature of the Three Vehicle teachings is distinct and unalterable.**

**「如是體」者，三乘之教八音章句各各有體，菩薩教以六度為體(云云)；**
**"Such an Essence": The teachings of the Three Vehicles, with their Eight Tones and chapters/sentences, each have an essence. The Bodhisattva teaching takes the Six Paramitas as essence (etc.).**

**「如是力」者，三乘教用訓導之力也；**
**"Such a Power": The functionality of the Three Vehicle teachings has the power to instruct and guide.**

**「如是作」者，三乘教被前人有造作也，廣實智境，略不牒章。**
**"Such an Action": The Three Vehicle teachings cover the previous persons' constructions/actions. Broadly [explaining] the Real Wisdom boundary, briefly not listing the chapters.**

**實境有四一，以四廣其一理，「如是因」者，境生真解為因，萬善望果也；**
**The Real Boundary has "Four Ones." Using the four to broaden the One Principle: "Such a Cause": The boundary generates true understanding as Cause; myriad goodnesses look toward the Fruit.**

**「如是緣」者，境發實智為緣，以因所望處為果，果起酬因為報。**
**"Such a Condition": The boundary activates Real Wisdom as Condition. Taking what the Cause looks toward as Fruit. The Fruit arising to repay the Cause is Retribution.**

**後二句雙結，初句結權，「本」即舉相，「末」即舉作，次句結實，「究竟」即結因，「等」即結報也。**
**The last two sentences form a Double Conclusion. The first concludes Provisional: "Beginning" brings up Mark; "End" brings up Action. The next concludes Real: "Ultimate" concludes Cause; "Equal" concludes Retribution.**

**北地師云：「三乘法皆有相、性、果、報、本末也。」**
**The Northern Masters say: "The dharmas of the Three Vehicles all have mark, nature, fruit, retribution, and beginning-and-end."**

**瑤師云：「如是相、性，此釋智慧照用三乘萌異，為相必爾成三為性；發心為體；隨心所堪為力；力有所造為作；作行招果為因；因者語其已分，所由為緣；緣者語其外力，遂剋為果；酬因為報；相為本；報為末；終同一致為究竟等也。如是者，其事不差也。」**
**Master Yao says: "'Such a mark' and 'such a nature' explain wisdom illuminating/operating with the Three Vehicles as they sprout divergences: that which must become the three is 'mark'; becoming the three is 'nature'. Arousing the mind is 'essence'. According to what the mind is capable of is 'power'. That which power produces is 'action'. Action-practice draws in fruit, and so is 'cause'. 'Cause' speaks of what is already apportioned; that from which it proceeds is 'condition'. 'Condition' speaks of external power; and so it masters and becomes 'fruit'. Repaying cause is 'retribution'. Mark is 'beginning'; retribution is 'end'. Finally, all are the same and one, and so it is 'ultimately equal'. In this way, the matter is not mistaken.'\"**

**暢師但約佛上作，相者，十力各有相貌也；**
**Master Chang only interprets it with reference to the Buddha: 'Mark' means the Ten Powers each has its own appearance.**

**性者，從根各有所習，所習不改謂之為性，是性力境也；**
**'Nature' means: from the faculties each has what it has become accustomed to; what is accustomed-to and does not change is called 'nature' - this is the boundary of the Nature Power.**

**體者，根性不同所欲亦異，言其心用縛著故以體為名，此欲力境也；**
**'Essence' means: the faculties and natures differ, and what is desired also differs. Speaking of the mind's functions being bound and attached, it is named 'essence' - this is the boundary of the Desire Power.**

**力者，定別名也，神通變動非定不運，鎮心靜亂非定不寂，故力為禪定境也；**
**'Power' is another name for concentration: supernormal transformations do not operate without concentration; calming the mind and stilling disturbance is not tranquil without concentration; therefore 'power' is the boundary of dhyana/concentration.**

**作者，是業，即業力境也；**
**'Action' is karma - that is, the boundary of the Karma Power.**

**因者，道為因能至涅槃，即至處道力境也；**
**'Cause' means: the path is the cause that can reach nirvana - that is, the boundary of the Power of the Path-to-the-Place.**

**緣者，緣宿命力境也；**
**'Condition' is the boundary of the Power of Recollecting Past Lives.**

**果者，據今因，所召果在未來，是天眼力境也；**
**'Fruit': based on the present cause, the fruit it summons lies in the future - this is the boundary of the Deva-Eye Power.**

**報者，今報以望往因，據即漏盡力境也，故語報是漏盡也；**
**'Retribution': taking the present retribution with reference to past causes - this is the boundary of the Power of Exhausting the Outflows; therefore it says that 'retribution' is 'exhausting the outflows'.**

**本者是相，末是報，總而望之都是處非處力境也。**
**'Beginning' is mark; 'end' is retribution. Taken together as a whole, they are all the boundary of the Power of Place/Non-Place.**

**上來諸釋非不一途，然於理不通，於文不允。**
**The above interpretations are not without a path, but they do not penetrate the Principle and do not accord with the Text.**

**文不允者經云「諸法」，何法不收？豈止三乘耶？**
**"Does not accord with the Text": The Sutra says "All Dharmas" (*Zhu Fa*). What dharma is not included? Does it stop at only the Three Vehicles?**

**理不通者，經云「實相」，何所不在，而但在因果體？**
**"Does not penetrate Principle": The Sutra says "Real Mark." Where is it not present? Yet [they say] it is only in Cause, Fruit, and Essence?**

**若實獨在於佛，佛則不權；權獨在三乘，三乘則永無實；若三乘但為五，則權法不足，復全無實；若四句但在佛，佛全無權，實亦不足；義不涉於凡夫，則諸法之文，便是無用。實相不遍，實相外別更有法。如此等過故，皆不用也。**
**If the real were exclusively in the Buddha, then the Buddha would not be provisional. If the provisional were exclusively in the Three Vehicles, then the Three Vehicles would forever lack the real. If the Three Vehicles were only \"for five,\" then the provisional dharmas would be insufficient and there would again be no real at all. If the four phrases were only in the Buddha, then the Buddha would entirely lack the provisional and the real would also be insufficient. If the meaning does not touch ordinary people, then the wording \"all dharmas\" becomes useless. If the Real Mark is not pervasive, then outside the Real Mark there would separately be other dharmas. Because of faults such as these, none of them are used.**

**《釋論》三十一，明一一法各有九種：一、各有體；二、各有法，如眼、耳雖同四大造，而眼有見用，耳無見功，如火以熱為法而不能潤也；三各有力，如火以燒為力，水以潤為力；四、各有因；五、各有緣；六、各有果；七、各有性；八、各有限礙；九、各有開通方便。**
**The *Treatise* (fascicle 31) clarifies that each and every dharma has nine kinds: (1) each has its own essence; (2) each has its own dharma—for example, although eye and ear are both made from the four great elements, the eye has the function of seeing, while the ear has no seeing function; like fire takes \"heat\" as its dharma yet cannot moisten; (3) each has its own power—for example, fire takes burning as its power, water takes moistening as its power; (4) each has its own cause; (5) each has its own condition; (6) each has its own fruit; (7) each has its own nature; (8) each has its own limitation/obstruction; (9) each has its own opening-and-penetrating expedient means.**

**達磨欝多將此九種會《法華》中十如：各有法者，即是《法華》中如是作；各有限礙者，即是《法華》中如是相；各有果者，即是《法華》中如是果，如是報也；各有開通方便者，即是《法華》中如是本末究竟等；餘者名同可解。**
**Dámó Yùduō correlates these nine kinds with the *Lotus*' Ten Suchnesses: \"each has its own dharma\" corresponds to the *Lotus*' \"such an action\"; \"each has its own limitation/obstruction\" corresponds to the *Lotus*' \"such a mark\"; \"each has its own fruit\" corresponds to the *Lotus*' \"such a fruit\" and \"such a retribution\"; \"each has its own opening-and-penetrating expedients\" corresponds to the *Lotus*' \"such a beginning and end ultimately equal\". The remaining items share the same names and can be understood.**

**今明此境為二：初一句略標權實章，如文；次十句廣釋權實相。**
**Now we clarify this boundary in two parts: 1. The first sentence briefly marks the Power/Real chapter, as in the text. 2. The next ten sentences broadly explain the marks of Power/Real.**

**今作四番釋：一、約十法界；二、約佛法界；三、約離合；四、約位。**
**Now we make Four Turns of Explanation:**
**1. According to the Ten Dharma Realms.**
**2. According to the Buddha Dharma Realm.**
**3. According to Separation and Combination.**
**4. According to Position/Stage.**

**經云「諸法」，故用十法界釋也；**
**The Sutra says "All Dharmas," therefore we use the Ten Dharma Realms to explain.**

**經云「佛所成就第一希有之法」，故用佛法界釋也；**
**The Sutra says "The foremost rare dharmas perfected by the Buddha," therefore we use the Buddha Dharma Realm to explain.**

**經云「止止不須說，我法妙難思」，故用離合釋也；**
**The Sutra says "Stop, stop, no need to speak, my Dharma is wonderful and difficult to conceive," therefore we use Separation and Combination to explain. [^6]**

**經云「唯佛與佛乃能究盡」，故用位釋也。**
**The Sutra says "Only a Buddha and a Buddha can exhaustively fathom it," therefore we use Position to explain.**

#### 1. According to the Ten Dharma Realms (Lines 282-283)

**約十法界者，謂六道、四聖，是為十法也。**
**According to the Ten Dharma Realms: Meaning the Six Paths and Four Sages; these are the Ten Dharmas.**

**法雖無量，數不出十，一一界中雖復多派，不出十如。**
**Although dharmas are measureless, their number does not exceed Ten. Within every single realm, although there are many branches, they do not exceed the Ten Suchnesses.**

**如地獄界，當地自具相性本末，**
**Like the Hell Realm: it inherently possesses its own Mark, Nature, [up to] Beginning and End.**

**亦具畜生界相性本末，乃至具佛法界相性本末，無有缺減，**
**It also possesses the Mark, Nature, Root, and Branch of the Animal Realm, up to possessing the Mark, Nature, Root, and Branch of the Buddha Dharma Realm, without lack or decrease. [^7]**

**故毘曇《毘婆沙》第七云：「地獄道成就他化天法」，即是其例，餘九法界亦如是。**
**Thus the *Abhidharma-vibhasha* (Fascicle 7) says: "The Hell Path perfects the dharmas of the Paranirmita-vasavartin Gods." This is an example; the other nine realms are also like this.**

**當知一一界皆有九界、十如，若照自位，九界、十如皆名為權；照其自位，佛界十如名之為實。**
**You should know: Every single realm possesses the Nine Realms and [their] Ten Suchnesses. If illuminating its own position [as distinct], the Nine Realms' Ten Suchnesses are all named Provisional. Illuminating its own position, the Buddha Realm's Ten Suchnesses are named Real.**

**一中具無量，無量中具一，所以名不可思議。**
**One contains Measureless; Measureless contains One. Therefore it is named Inconceivable.**

**若照六道、三聖，五如為權；若照佛界，四如為實。**
**If illuminating the Six Paths and Three Sages, five suchnesses are provisional; if illuminating the Buddha Realm, four suchnesses are real.**

**當分歷歷，此則可說、可示，何俟止止絕言歎也？**
**If it were discriminated clearly, then it could be spoken and could be shown - why wait for "stop, stop" and the praise that cuts off words?**

**所以一中無量，凡夫雖具，絕理情迷；二乘雖具，捨離求脫；菩薩雖具，照則不周，名不了了；**
**Therefore: within the one there is the immeasurable. Although ordinary people possess it, their feelings are deluded and cut off from the principle. Although the Two Vehicles possess it, they abandon and depart, seeking liberation. Although bodhisattvas possess it, their illumination is not yet complete; they are called \"not-yet-fully-illumining.\"**

**如來洞覽橫豎具足，唯獨自明了，餘人所不見，不可宣示，止止絕言其在此耳。**
**The Tathagata penetratively surveys, possessing horizontal and vertical completeness; only he alone clearly knows. What other people do not see cannot be proclaimed or shown - the \"stop, stop\" and cutting off of words lies here.**

**上《玄義》中已說，今不具記(云云)。**
**This has already been explained above in the *Xuanyi*; here it is not fully recorded (etc.).**

#### 2. According to the Buddha Dharma Realm (Lines 284-285)

**二、約佛法界釋者，佛界非相、非不相，而名如是相，指萬善緣因，故下文云「眾寶莊校」，即其義也。**
**2. According to the Buddha Dharma Realm: The Buddha Realm is neither Mark nor Non-Mark, yet is named "Such a Mark." It refers to the "Myriad Goodness Conditional Cause," as the text below says "Adorned with various gems"; this is the meaning.**

**佛界非性、非不性，而名如是性，指智慧了因，故下文云「有大白牛」也。**
**The Buddha Realm is neither Nature nor Non-Nature, yet is named "Such a Nature." It refers to the "Wisdom Revealing Cause," as the text below says "There is a Great White Ox." [^8]**

**佛界非體、非不體，而名如是體，指實相正因，故下文云「其車高廣」也。**
**The Buddha Realm is neither Essence nor Non-Essence, yet is named "Such an Essence." It refers to the "Real Mark Correct Cause," as the text below says "The carriage is high and broad."**

**佛界非力、非不力，而名為力，指菩提道心，慈善根力等，故下文云「又於其上張設幰蓋」也。**
**The Buddha Realm is neither Power nor Non-Power, yet is named "Power." It refers to the Bodhi Mind, Compassion, and Root Power, as the text below says "And on top of it set up canopies."**

**佛界非作、非不作，而名如是作，指任運無功用道，故下文云「其疾如風」也。**
**The Buddha Realm is neither Action nor Non-Action, yet is named "Such an Action." It refers to the effortless, unconditioned Way, as the text below says "Swift as the wind."**

**佛界非因、非不因，而名如是因，指四十一位，故下文「乘是寶乘遊於四方」也。**
**The Buddha Realm is neither Cause nor Non-Cause, yet is named "Such a Cause." It refers to the Forty-one Stages, as the text below says "Riding this Treasure Carriage, roaming the four directions."**

**佛界非緣、非不緣，而名如是緣，指一切助菩提道，故下文「又多僕從而侍衛之」。**
**The Buddha Realm is neither Condition nor Non-Condition, yet is named "Such a Condition." It refers to all aids to the Bodhi Way, as the text below says "Also many servants guarding it."**

**佛界非果、非不果，而名如是果，指妙覺朗然，圓因所剋，故下文「直至道場」也。**
**The Buddha Realm is neither Fruit nor Non-Fruit, yet is named "Such a Fruit." It refers to Marvelous Awakening being bright and clear, mastered by the Perfect Cause, as the text below says "Going straight to the Bodhimanda."**

**佛界非報、非不報，而名如是報，指大般涅槃，故下文「得無量無漏清淨之果報」也。**
**The Buddha Realm is neither Retribution nor Non-Retribution, yet is named "Such a Retribution." It refers to Great Parinirvana, as the text below says "Obtaining measureless, leakless, pure fruit-retribution."**

**佛果非本、非末，而言本末，本即佛相，末即佛報，是自行權也。**
**The Buddha Fruit is neither Beginning nor End, yet we speak of Beginning and End. Beginning is the Buddha Mark; End is the Buddha Retribution. This is the Self-Practice Provisional.**

**佛界非等、非不等，而言究竟等，指於實相，故標章云實相也。**
**The Buddha Realm is neither Equal nor Non-Equal, yet we speak of Ultimate Equality. It refers to the Real Mark, thus the chapter title says "Real Mark."**

**是自行之實也，即實而權故言本末，即權而實故言為等，**
**This is the Self-Practice Real. Because it is Real yet Provisional, we speak of Beginning and End. Because it is Provisional yet Real, we speak of Being Equal.**

**此是如來自行權實，最為無上。**
**This is the Tathāgata's Self-Practice Power/Real, which is most supreme.**

**無上相乃至無上果報，橫廣豎深而無有上，故標章云諸法實相也。**
**From unsurpassed mark up through unsurpassed fruit-retribution: horizontally broad and vertically deep, with nothing above - therefore the chapter title says \"Real Mark of all dharmas.\"**

**例亦應言諸法實性、實體、實力，乃至應言實究竟等，但略舉一而蔽諸耳。**
**By the same pattern, one should also say \"real nature of all dharmas,\" \"real essence,\" \"real power,\" up to saying \"real ultimately-equal,\" but it briefly raises one to cover the rest.**

**如來遍照橫豎悉周如觀掌果，秖為凡夫如雙盲，二乘如眇目，菩薩夜視矇朧不曉，不可得說，止止絕言，其意在此耳。**
**The Tathagata pervasively illuminates; horizontally and vertically all are entirely complete - like looking at a fruit in one's palm. But ordinary people are like the doubly blind; the Two Vehicles are like the one-eyed; bodhisattvas see at night, dimly and not yet understanding. It cannot be spoken; \"stop, stop\" and cutting off words - the intent lies here.**

#### 3. According to Separation and Combination (Lines 286-287)

**三、約離合者，若佛心中所觀，十界、十如皆無上相，乃至無上果報，唯是一佛法界，如海總萬流、若千車共一轍，此即自行權實；**
**3. According to Separation and Combination: If contemplated within the Buddha's mind, the Ten Realms and Ten Suchnesses are all unsurpassed marks, up through unsurpassed fruit-retribution—there is only the single Buddha Dharma Realm, like the sea gathering all streams, or like a thousand carts sharing one track. This is the Self-Practice Power/Real.**

**若隨他意則有九法界、十如相性等，即是化他權實。**
**If according with others' minds, there are Nine Dharma Realms, Ten Suchnesses, Marks, Natures, etc. This is the Converting-Others Power/Real.**

**化他雖復有實，皆束為權；自行雖復有權，皆束為實，此即自行化他權實。**
**Although Converting-Others possesses the Real, it is all bundled as Provisional. Although Self-Practice possesses the Provisional, it is all bundled as Real. This is the Self-Practice Converting-Others Power/Real.**

**隨他則開，隨自則合，橫豎周照開合自在，雖開無量，無量而一；雖合為一，一而無量。**
**Following others, it opens; following self, it closes. Horizontally and vertically it illuminates everywhere; opening and closing are自在 (free/unimpeded). Although it opens into the immeasurable, the immeasurable is one; although it closes into one, the one is immeasurable.**

**雖無量一，而非一、非無量；雖非一、非無量而一而無量，唯佛與佛乃能究盡，凡夫則誹謗不信，二乘則迷悶不受，菩薩則塵杌未明，為此義故止止絕言(云云)。**
**Although \"immeasurable-one,\" it is neither one nor immeasurable; although neither one nor immeasurable, it is one-and-immeasurable. Only a Buddha and a Buddha can fully exhaust it. Ordinary people slander and disbelieve; the Two Vehicles are confused and do not accept; bodhisattvas are still dusty and dark, not yet clear. For this meaning, therefore, it says \"stop, stop\" and cuts off words (etc.).**

#### 4. According to Position (Lines 288)

**四、約位者，如是相者，一切眾生皆有實相，本自有之，乃是如來藏之相貌也；**
**4. According to Position: "Such a Mark": All sentient beings possess the Real Mark; they originally possess it themselves. It is the mark of the *Tathāgatagarbha*. [^9]**

**如是性，即是性德智慧第一義空也；**
**"Such a Nature": This is the Virtue of Nature, Wisdom, the Primary Meaning Emptiness.**

**如是體，即是中道法性之理也，是為三德，通十法界位位皆有。**
**"Such an Essence": This is the Principle of the Middle Way Dharma Nature. These are the Three Virtues, pervasive in the Ten Dharma Realms, existing in every position.**

**若研此三德入於十信位，則名如是力、如是作；**
**If one grinds/polishes these Three Virtues and enters the Ten Faiths Position, it is named "Such a Power, Such an Action."**

**入四十一地，名如是因、如是緣；**
**Entering the Forty-one Lands [Stages], it is named "Such a Cause, Such a Condition."**

**若至佛地，名如是果、如是報。**
**If arriving at the Buddha Ground, it is named "Such a Fruit, Such a Retribution."**

**初三名本，後三名末，初後同是三德，故言究竟等。**
**The first three are named Beginning; the last three are named End. Beginning and End are identically the Three Virtues, therefore it says "Ultimately Equal."**

**初位三德通惡、通善，通賢、通聖，通小、通大，通始、通極，**
**In the initial position, the Three Virtues are common to evil and common to good; common to the worthy and common to the sagely; common to the small and common to the great; common to the beginning and common to the ultimate.**

**雖在惡而不沈，雖在善而不升，雖在賢而不下，雖在聖而不高，**
**Though in evil, they do not sink; though in good, they do not rise; though in the worthy, they are not low; though in the sagely, they are not high.**

**雖在小而不窄，雖在大而不寬，雖在始而非新，雖在極而非故，**
**Though in the small, they are not narrow; though in the great, they are not broad; though in the beginning, they are not new; though in the ultimate, they are not old.**

**故是不可思議、不可得說，止止絕言耳。**
**Therefore they are inconceivable and cannot be spoken; hence it says \"stop, stop\" and cuts off words.**

**Regarding the "Three Virtues": 1. The Real Mark of All Dharmas is the Dharma Body Virtue (*Dharmakāya*). 2. Knowing the various Dharmas is Wisdom Virtue (*Prajñā*). 3. Merits and various practices are Liberation Virtue (*Mokṣa*).**

**[290] 復次，三德究竟等者，十界相性權實開合差別若干，以平等大慧如實觀之，究竟皆等。**
**Furthermore, regarding \"the Three Virtues are ultimately equal\": among the Ten Dharma Realms, the marks and natures—provisional/real, opening/closing, and their various distinctions—when contemplated as-it-is with great, equal wisdom, are ultimately all equal.**

**若迷此境，即有六界相性，名為世諦；若解此境，即有二乘相性，名為真諦；達此非迷非解，即有菩薩、佛界性相中道第一義諦。**
**If deluded regarding this boundary, there are the marks and natures of the Six Realms, named Worldly Truth. If understanding this boundary, there are the marks and natures of the Two Vehicles, named True Truth. Penetrating this as neither delusion nor understanding, there are the nature-and-marks of the Bodhisattva and Buddha Realms: the Middle Way Primary-Meaning Truth.**

**若以此慧等於俗諦，俗諦非迷；等於真諦，真諦非解。非解非迷，雙非迷解，但名平等。**
**If, by this wisdom, one makes it equal to the secular truth, then secular truth is not \"delusion\". If one makes it equal to the true truth, then true truth is not \"understanding.\" Neither-understanding nor delusion—negating both delusion and understanding—this is simply called \"equality.\"**

**若雙照者，權即是實，實即是權，雖二而不二，亦名究竟等也。**
**If one illuminates both, then the provisional is precisely the real, and the real is precisely the provisional: though two, not two—this is also called \"ultimately equal.\"**

**又權實不二之境七種方便，不能以不二智等不二之境，唯有諸佛以不二智等不二境，故言究竟等。**
**Further: regarding the non-dual boundary of provisional and real— the seven kinds of expedients cannot, with non-dual wisdom, make equal that non-dual boundary. Only the Buddhas, with non-dual wisdom, can make equal the non-dual boundary—therefore it says \"ultimately equal.\"**

**又今大乘機動，不明九界性相，直說一切性相悉入佛界性相，昔教不說，謂昔不與今等；今教說之，知昔與今等，故言究竟等。**
**Further: now the Mahāyāna capacities are stirred. It does not clarify the nature-and-marks of the Nine Realms; it directly says that all natures and marks entirely enter the Buddha-Realm's natures and marks. The former teachings did not speak this, thus one says the former are not equal to the present. The present teaching speaks it, and thus one knows the former and present are equal—therefore it says \"ultimately equal.\"**

**初、約惑解等；次、約人等；後、約教等，說此甚廣，記者不能委悉耳。**
**First, this was explained by \"delusion/understanding\" equality; next, by \"persons\" equality; finally, by \"teachings\" equality. This is spoken very broadly—recorders cannot relate it in full detail.**

**若就絕言絕思，明不可思議，《釋論》七十九云：「不可思議名不決定，出一切心心數法，出一切言語道，不能行、不能到，故名不可思議。」**
**If, in terms of cutting off words and cutting off thought, one clarifies \"inconceivable\": the *Treatise* says (fascicle 79): \"Inconceivable means indeterminate; it transcends all mind and mental factors; it transcends every path of language. One cannot practice it, cannot arrive at it—therefore it is called inconceivable.\"**

**若就譬喻明不可思議，如《釋論》十四：「不以敗壞色得趣平等道，觀色不異乃能等於大乘。如明與暗共合，而汝不見，謂明暗異，欲知其義，如彼月光。又日出時暗不向十方，暗常在，無所歸趣；明亦如是與暗共合。生死與道合，道即是生死，佛之所盡已盡、所度已度，皆不可思議。」**
**If, by simile, one clarifies \"inconceivable\": the *Treatise* says (fascicle 14): \"One does not approach the equal path by destroying form; by contemplating that form is not different, one can become equal to the Mahāyāna. It is like light and darkness joining together: yet you do not see it and claim light and darkness are different. If you want to know this meaning, [it is] like moonlight. Further, when the sun rises, darkness does not go toward the ten directions; darkness always remains and has nowhere to return. Light is also like this, joining together with darkness. Birth-and-death joins with the path; the path is precisely birth-and-death. What the Buddha has ended is already ended; what he has ferried across is already ferried across— all are inconceivable.\"**

**諸經諸論此例甚多。**
**In various sutras and treatises, examples like this are very numerous.**

**若就事中不可思議者，如《阿含經》明四不可思議，謂眾生、世界、龍、佛。**
**If, within \"events,\" one speaks of the inconceivable: the *Agamas* clarify four inconceivables: sentient beings, the world, dragons, and the Buddha.**

**眾生從何處來？向何處去？為底而生？為底而死？世界為有邊？無邊？為可斷？不可斷？為天龍人鬼誰所造耶？**
**From where do sentient beings come? To where do they go? For what do they live? For what do they die? Is the world bounded or unbounded? Can it be cut off or cannot it be cut off? Who made the devas, dragons, humans, and ghosts?**

**《阿含》云：「一士夫於王舍城拘絺羅池側，思惟世間邊、無邊，見四兵入藕絲孔，自驚我狂耶？世無此狂。問佛，佛言：『非狂，是脩羅！為諸天所逐，退入藕絲孔藏。』」**
**The *Agamas* say: \"A man, by the side of the Gucchila pond in Rājagṛha, contemplated whether the world is bounded or unbounded. He saw four armies enter the hole of a lotus-fiber, and was startled: 'Am I mad? There is no such madness in the world.' He asked the Buddha. The Buddha said: 'Not madness—an asura! Chased by the devas, he retreated and hid in the hole of a lotus-fiber.'\"**

**此乃世間思惟非涅槃道，無義饒益、無法饒益、無梵行饒益(云云)。**
**This is worldly speculation, not the nirvana-path; it has no benefit in meaning, no benefit in dharma, no benefit in the holy life (etc.).**

**龍雨為從龍口、耳、眼、鼻、舌出耶？實不從爾許出，但從其念出，念善、念惡皆能出雨，由前本行今得是力。**
**Does a dragon's rain come out from the dragon's mouth, ears, eyes, nose, or tongue? In truth it does not come from those places; it comes only from its thought. Both good thoughts and bad thoughts can produce rain—because of prior root practices, it now obtains this power.**

**須彌腹有天名大力亦能作雨。**
**In the belly of Mount Sumeru there is a deva named Great Strength who can also produce rain.**

**又經出五道各一不可思議：地獄有斷續，畜生能飛，鬼能變少為多，人能令火燒薪，天能自然致果報，皆是果報法事不可思議(云云)。**
**Further, sutras produce one \"inconceivable\" for each of the five paths: hell has interruption and continuation; animals can fly; ghosts can transform the few into the many; humans can make fire burn fuel; devas can naturally bring about karmic retribution—all are inconceivable matters of karmic result (etc.).**

**此是約因緣事，釋不可思議，況甚深境界，寧非不可思議耶？**
**This explains \"inconceivable\" in terms of events of causes and conditions—how much more would an extremely profound realm not be inconceivable?**

### 5. Commentary on the Verses (Lines 292-312)

**[292] 偈有二十一行，為兩：初十七行半頌長行，後三行半略開三顯一，動執生疑。**
**There are twenty-one verse lines, divided into two: the first seventeen and a half lines versify the prose; the latter three and a half lines briefly open the three and reveal the one, shaking attachment and giving rise to doubt.**

**前又二：初四行頌寄言歎，後十三行半頌絕言歎。**
**The former part again has two: the first four lines versify the \"praise via words\"; the latter thirteen and a half lines versify the \"praise transcending words.\"**

**夫偈頌長行互有廣略者，令義易顯耳。**
**Verses and prose alternately have breadth and brevity only so that the meaning is easy to manifest.**

**長行二佛權實各歎表化緣異，故頌中二佛合歎，示二智理同故。**
**In the prose, the two Buddhas' Power/Real are praised separately, indicating that the transforming conditions differ. Therefore, in the verses, the two Buddhas are praised together, indicating that the principle of the two wisdoms is the same.**

**[294] 初寄言中又二：初兩行合頌二佛二智，後二行合頌二佛釋歎結歎等也。**
**Within the initial \"praise via words\" there are again two: the first two lines collectively versify the two Buddhas' two wisdoms; the latter two lines collectively versify the two Buddhas' explanation-praise and concluding-praise, and so on.**

**初又二：今初一句「世雄」者，頌上諸佛智慧也。**
**The first two lines again have two parts. The first sentence \"World-Hero\" versifies the above \"All Buddhas' wisdom.\"**

**「不可量」者，頌上甚深無量。此頌諸佛實智也。**
**\"Immeasurable\" versifies the above \"extremely profound and measureless.\" This versifies All Buddhas' Real Wisdom.**

**次三句頌上諸佛權智，此有三異：一、上舉人又標法，故云諸佛智慧；今頌但頌人，將人以美法，故云世雄。**
**The next three sentences versify the above All Buddhas' Provisional Wisdom. This has three differences. First: above, it raised the person and also marked the dharma, therefore it said \"All Buddhas' wisdom.\" Now the verse only versifies the person; using the person to adorn the dharma, therefore it says \"World-Hero.\"**

**二者、上開歎，今合歎，以法別故須開，以人總故須合。**
**Second: above it opened out the praise; now it combines the praise. Because dharmas are distinct, it must open; because persons are general, it must combine.**

**三者、上云一切二乘不知，今言一切眾生類不知。**
**Third: above it said all Two Vehicles do not know; now it says all classes of sentient beings do not know.**

**「佛力」下，後一行頌歎釋迦二智也。**
**From \"Buddha powers\" downward, the latter line versifies praise of Śākyamuni's two wisdoms.**

**「佛」者頌吾從成佛也，正頌實智；「力、無畏」等頌諸功德，是頌權智；**
**\"Buddha\" versifies \"Since I became Buddha\"—properly versifying Real Wisdom. \"Powers\" and \"fearlessnesses,\" and the like, versify the various merits—this versifies Provisional Wisdom.**

**「餘法」者即指化他之權，是實智之餘助耳，正頌上種種因緣(云云)。**
**\"Other dharmas\" directly points to the provisional of converting others; it is simply an auxiliary to Real Wisdom. It properly versifies the above \"various causes and conditions\" (etc.).**

**「本從」下，後二行合頌二佛，釋歎結歎之意也。**
**From \"Originally following\" downward, the latter two lines collectively versify the two Buddhas—the meaning of explaining-praise and concluding-praise.**

**「本從無數佛具足行諸道」，頌上諸佛釋歎「佛曾親近百千諸佛盡行道法」之文也。**
**\"Originally following countless Buddhas, fully practicing all ways\" versifies the above All Buddhas explanation-praise: \"The Buddha has intimately approached hundreds of thousands of Buddhas, exhaustively practicing the way-dharmas.\"**

**「甚深微妙法」，頌上結歎實成就甚深未曾有法也。**
**\"The profoundly deep and subtle Dharma\" versifies the above concluding-praise of the real: \"accomplishing the profoundly deep, unprecedented Dharma.\"**

**「難見難可了」，頌上結歎權意趣難解也。**
**\"Hard to see, hard to understand\" versifies the above concluding-praise of the provisional: \"the purport is hard to understand.\"**

**「於無量億劫，行此諸道已」，頌上釋釋迦知見波羅蜜皆已得具足。上二句舉因具足，次下一句舉果具足。**
**\"Over immeasurable billions of kalpas, having practiced these ways\" versifies the above explanation of Śākyamuni: knowledge-and-vision pāramitā is already fully possessed. The first two sentences raise the sufficiency of the cause; the next single sentence raises the sufficiency of the fruit.**

**「我已悉知見」一句，頌上結釋迦二智如來知見廣大之文也。**
**The single sentence \"I have already fully known and seen\" versifies the above conclusion of Śākyamuni's two wisdoms: \"the Tathāgata's knowledge and vision is broad and great.\"**

**[296] 或時用四偈，合頌上二佛權實。**
**Sometimes one uses four gāthās to collectively versify the above two Buddhas' Power/Real.**

**文為六：初、「世雄」一句，總頌二佛二智；二、「諸天及世人」三句，頌揀人；三、「佛力」下一行，頌釋迦中釋權實；四、「本從」下一行，頌諸佛釋權實；五、「於無量」下半行，頌上行因；六、「道場得成」下二句，頌上得果。**
**The text has six: (1) the single sentence \"World-Hero\" generally versifies the two Buddhas' two wisdoms; (2) the three sentences \"devas and humans of the world\" versify selecting persons; (3) the single line from \"Buddha powers\" versifies Śākyamuni's explanation of Power/Real; (4) the single line from \"Originally following\" versifies all Buddhas' explanation of Power/Real; (5) the half-line from \"Over immeasurable\" versifies the cause-practice; (6) the two sentences from \"attaining at the bodhimanda\" versify obtaining the fruit.**

**[298] 從「如是大果報」去，第二，有十三行半，頌上絕言也。**
**From \"Such great fruit-retribution\" onward, the second part has thirteen and a half lines, versifying the above praise transcending words.**

**文為五：初半行「如是大果報」，即頌不思議境，但舉初，後、中間略可知，義字兼頌究竟等也。大與種種，如《玄義》中說。**
**The text has five: first, the half-line \"Such great fruit-retribution\" versifies the inconceivable realm. It only raises the beginning; the latter and the middle can be known in brief. The character \"meaning\" also versifies \"ultimately equal.\" \"Great\" and \"various\" are as explained in the *Profound Meaning* (*Xuanyi*).**

**「我及十方佛」下，第二，半行，追頌「取要言之佛悉成就」也。**
**From \"I and the Buddhas of the ten directions\" downward: second, a half-line, retroactively versifying \"To take the essential point, the Buddha has perfected [all].\"**

**「不可示」下，第三，半行，追頌上「止不須說」也，實相非方所故不可示，非言語道故言辭相寂滅。**
**From \"Cannot be shown\" downward: third, a half-line, retroactively versifying \"Stop, no need to speak.\" Because the Real Mark is not a location, it cannot be shown; because it is not a path of language, therefore it says the marks of speech are quiescent.**

**從「諸餘眾生類」下，第四，頌舉不知之人，故上長行明無有知者故止而不說。**
**From \"All other classes of sentient beings\" downward: fourth, the verse raises the persons who do not know. Therefore, above, the prose clarified that there are none who know; thus the Buddha stops and does not speak.**

**頌中十行半，頌出不知之人，文為八：初半偈總揀不入者，即七方便也；**
**Within the verses, ten and a half lines versify the persons who do not know. The text has eight: first, a half-verse generally selecting those who do not enter—namely the seven kinds of expedients.**

**「除諸」下，第二，二句，揀能入者，即圓教十信，故言「信力堅固者」也。長行明究竟佛知，頌中明初信知，互舉耳。**
**From \"Except the various\" downward: second, two sentences selecting those who can enter—namely the Ten Faiths of the Perfect Teaching—therefore it says \"those whose faith-power is firm.\" The prose clarifies that ultimately only a Buddha knows; the verse clarifies that the first faith knows—each is raised in relation to the other.**

**「諸佛子」下，第三，有一行半，揀二乘不知。**
**From \"Buddha-sons\" downward: third, one and a half lines selecting that the Two Vehicles do not know.**

**「假使滿」下，第四，有一行，舉身子不知。**
**From \"Even if [they] fill\" downward: fourth, one line raising that Śāriputra does not know.**

**「正使滿」下，第五，一行半，舉諸大弟子。**
**From \"Even if [they] fill\" [again] downward: fifth, one and a half lines raising the great disciples.**

**「辟支佛」下，第六，二行，舉支佛。**
**From \"Pratyekabuddhas\" downward: sixth, two lines raising the pratyekabuddhas.**

**「新發意」下，第七，二行半，舉發心菩薩不入。**
**From \"newly aroused resolve\" downward: seventh, two and a half lines raising that newly resolved bodhisattvas do not enter.**

**發心語通，或可六度菩薩三僧祇未斷惑名為發心；或可指上人天中自攝得六度，而發心之語別擬通、別等發心也。**
**The phrase \"arousing the mind\" is general: it may refer to Six-Pāramitā bodhisattvas who, over three asaṃkhyeya [kalpas], have not yet cut off delusions and are called \"arousing the mind\"; it may also refer to the above [human and heavenly beings] who, within themselves, gathered the Six Pāramitās—while the phrase \"arousing the mind\" separately corresponds to the Shared, Distinct, and other kinds of arousing the mind.**

**「不退菩薩」下，第八，有一行，揀不退菩薩亦不知也。通教不退斷界內惑，是故不知別理；別教地前亦有證位不退、行不退等，亦所不知也。**
**From \"non-retreating bodhisattvas\" downward: eighth, one line selecting that non-retreating bodhisattvas also do not know. In the Shared Teaching, non-retreating cuts off delusions within the realm; therefore it does not know the distinct principle. In the Distinct Teaching, before the grounds there are also non-retreating in realization and non-retreating in practice, and so on—these too do not know.**

**[300] 次「又告舍利弗無漏」下，第五，一行半，頌上難解法佛能知實相境。**
**Next, from \"Again he told Śāriputra: without outflows...\" downward, the fifth part—one and a half lines—versifies the above hard-to-understand Dharma: the Buddha can know the realm of the Real Mark.**

**「無漏不思議」者，頌上結要，舉權實所止之境也。**
**\"Without outflows, inconceivable\" versifies the above conclusion of essentials, raising the realm where Power/Real abide.**

**「甚深微妙法」一句，頌上第一希有難解之法。**
**The single sentence \"the profoundly deep and subtle Dharma\" versifies the above first \"rare\" and hard-to-understand Dharma.**

**「我今已具得」三句，頌上唯佛與佛乃能究盡也，明諸佛道同，同皆究竟，故云：「唯我知是相，十方佛亦然。」**
**The three sentences \"I now have fully attained\" versify the above \"only Buddha with Buddha can fully exhaust\": clarifying that the Buddha-way is the same for all Buddhas, and being the same, all fully exhaust it. Therefore it says: \"Only I know this mark; the Buddhas of the ten directions are also thus.\"**

**[302] 釋不思議者，如如意珠無毫釐之有能雨眾寶，實相不生能生般若也。**
**Explaining \"inconceivable\": it is like a wish-fulfilling jewel that, without a hair's-breadth of existence, can rain down many treasures. The Real Mark does not arise, yet can give rise to prajñā.**

**「無漏不思議」一行半為本，生出四種解釋，已如上說。**
**The one-and-a-half lines \"without outflows, inconceivable\" are the basis that produces four kinds of explanation, as already explained above.**

**從無漏半句，為十法界釋作本，十法界十如，收諸凡聖理性無漏失也，收三諦無漏失，權實智無漏失。**
**Taking the half-sentence \"without outflows\" as the basis for the \"ten Dharma realms\" explanation: the ten Dharma realms and ten suchnesses gather the principle-nature \"without-outflows\" of all ordinary and sage beings; they gather the three truths' \"without-outflows\"; and they gather the Power/Real wisdom's \"without-outflows.\"**

**約不思議為開合釋作本，即權而實，即實而權，故不可思議也。**
**Taking \"inconceivable\" as the basis for the \"opening/closing\" explanation: provisional is precisely real, and real is precisely provisional—therefore it is inconceivable.**

**約甚深微妙法，為佛法界釋作本，此可知。**
**Taking \"profoundly deep and subtle Dharma\" as the basis for the \"Buddha Dharma-realm\" explanation—this can be known.**

**約唯我知是相，為約位釋作本，此亦可知(云云)。**
**Taking \"Only I know this mark\" as the basis for the \"according to position\" explanation—this too can be known (etc.).**

**[304] 從「舍利弗當知諸佛語無異」下，略開三顯一，動執生疑。**
**From \"Śāriputra, you should know that the Buddhas' words are without difference\" downward: this is the Brief Opening of the Three to Reveal the One, shaking attachment and giving rise to doubt.**

**就開顯為二：初、明諸佛顯實，次、明釋迦開三，互明一邊耳。**
**Regarding \"opening and revealing,\" there are two: first clarifying all Buddhas revealing the real; next clarifying Śākyamuni opening the three—each clarifies one side in mutual illumination.**

**「諸佛語無異」者，此論諸佛化道是同，次兩句勸信，後兩句正顯實。**
**\"The Buddhas' words are without difference\" discusses that all Buddhas' transforming path is the same. The next two sentences exhort to faith; the last two sentences directly reveal the real.**

**「世尊法久後，要當說真實」，即顯真。**
**\"After a long time, the World-Honored One's Dharma will surely speak the true real\"—this reveals the true.**

**動昔之執，生今之疑，將非魔作佛，正由聞此語也。**
**It shakes former attachments and gives rise to present doubt: \"Could it be that Māra has made himself into a Buddha?\"—this is precisely due to hearing these words.**

**佛既如實語勸信，何事翻疑？為防因疑起謗者，故須勸信耳。**
**Since the Buddha, by true words, exhorts faith, why then turn and doubt? To prevent slander arising from doubt, he therefore must exhort faith.**

**從「告諸聲聞眾」下，明釋迦開三，文為三：初一行正明開三，將明二乘之非，故言「逮得涅槃者」。**
**From \"He told the assembly of śrāvakas\" downward, it clarifies Śākyamuni opening the three. The text has three: first, one line directly clarifies opening the three. Since it is clarifying the Two Vehicles' error, it says \"those who have reached nirvana.\"**

**又解「我令脫苦縛逮得涅槃」，即擬六度菩薩乘。**
**It is also explained that \"I cause [them] to be freed from the bondage of suffering and to reach nirvana\" corresponds to the Six-Pāramitā bodhisattva vehicle.**

**何以知之？修六度行即免四趣縛，未能入滅度，三僧祇百劫乃得涅槃，逮之言遠乃及耳。**
**How do we know? Cultivating the Six Pāramitās frees one from the bondage of the four destinies, yet one cannot enter extinction. Only after three asaṃkhyeya [kalpas] and a hundred kalpas does one obtain nirvana. The word \"reach\" implies that only from afar does one arrive.**

**又六度行前度他，故言「我令脫苦縛」，後取無漏，故言「逮得涅槃」，此義推之，知是六度乘也。**
**Further, in Six-Pāramitā practice, first one ferries others across, therefore it says \"I cause [them] to be freed from the bondage of suffering\"; later one takes up \"without outflows,\" therefore it says \"reach nirvana.\" Pushing this meaning, we know it is the Six-Pāramitā vehicle.**

**又以數推之，下句云「佛以方便力，示以三乘教」，若不指此，將何為三？不應重數二乘為三乘也。**
**Further, reasoning from the count: the next sentence says \"The Buddha, by the power of expedients, shows the teaching of three vehicles.\" If it does not point to this, what would make the \"three\"? One should not redundantly count the Two Vehicles as the three vehicles.**

**次半行正斥三乘皆是虛偽，次兩句出立三之意，意是權引離諸苦故，非為真實，但是方便門耳。**
**Next, the half-line directly rebukes the three vehicles as all false and deceptive. Next, two sentences bring forth the intent of establishing the three: the intent is provisionally guiding [beings] away from various sufferings; it is not for the sake of the true real—it is only the gate of expedients.**

**[306] ○從「爾時大眾」下，是騰疑致請，由聞三偽一真故，執動疑生。**
**From \"At that time the great assembly\" downward: this is raising doubt and making a request. Because they hear three false and one true, attachments are shaken and doubt arises.**

**文為二：一、敘疑；二、正請決。**
**The text has two: (1) narrating the doubt; (2) directly requesting a decision.**

**敘疑又二：一、經家敘；二、正生疑。**
**The narration of doubt also has two: (1) the sutra-compiler narrates; (2) doubt actually arises.**

**先、敘千二百疑；次、敘四眾。**
**First, it narrates the doubts of the twelve hundred; next, it narrates the four assemblies.**

**上斥三乘皆是方便，敘疑但在二乘者，以其執重疑深偏舉。**
**Above, it rebuked the three vehicles as all expedients. Yet it narrates doubt only in the Two Vehicles because their attachments are heavy and their doubt deep, thus it singles them out.**

**若至下陳疑中，即云求佛諸、菩薩大數有八萬，亦皆有疑，故知三乘僉疑，偏舉二乘耳。**
**But when it reaches the later listing of doubts, it says the vast number of bodhisattvas seeking Buddhahood is eighty thousand, and they too all have doubt. Thus we know the three vehicles all doubt; it only singled out the Two Vehicles.**

**從「各作是念」下，是正疑，又為二：一、疑佛二智；二、疑己所得。**
**From \"each had this thought\" downward is the actual doubt. It again has two: (1) doubting the Buddha's two wisdoms; (2) doubting what they themselves have obtained.**

**從「何故殷懃稱歎方便」，即是總疑權實二智。**
**From \"Why does he earnestly praise expedient means\" is the general doubt of the two wisdoms of Power/Real.**

**從「而作是言，佛所得法甚深」者，是疑實智；「有所言說意趣難知」下，是疑權智。**
**From \"and he says: the Dharma attained by the Buddha is extremely profound\" is doubting Real Wisdom. From \"what is spoken has an intent hard to know\" downward is doubting Provisional Wisdom.**

**以聞「諸佛語無異，要當說真實」，從此生疑。**
**Because they heard \"The Buddhas' words are without difference; it will surely speak the true real\"—from this, doubt arises.**

**何者？佛昔說三乘智慧同證不差，但餘習有盡不盡耳。**
**Why? Formerly the Buddha said the three vehicles' wisdoms verify the same and do not differ; only the residual habits are exhausted or not exhausted.**

**今忽稱歎如來二智非我所及，是故疑佛二智也。**
**Now suddenly he praises the Tathāgata's two wisdoms as beyond what I can reach; therefore they doubt the Buddha's two wisdoms.**

**從「佛說一解脫義，我等亦得此法」下，此是自疑所得。**
**From \"The Buddha speaks one liberation meaning; we too have obtained this Dharma\" downward—this is self-doubt about what they have obtained.**

**三乘聖道是真出要，我修此理亦到涅槃，而今忽言皆是方便，未知何者真實，故言不知是義所趣。**
**The three vehicles' noble path is truly an escape. I cultivate this principle and also reach nirvana, yet now he suddenly says it is all expedient means. Not knowing what is truly real, therefore they say they do not know where this meaning tends.**

**此從上斥三為偽而生是疑。**
**This doubt arises from the above rebuking the three as false.**

**[308] 「爾時舍利」下，第二，正請。文有三請二止，就前為三止。**
**From \"At that time Śāriputra\" downward, the second part is the direct request. The text has three requests and two stops; together with what came before, it makes three stops.**

**瑤師、龍師云：「初止為理深難解，初請為自他求決；次止為驚疑不信，次請為久殖必解；後止為必謗墮惡，後請為利根得益。」**
**Masters Yao and Long say: \"The first stop is because the principle is deep and hard to understand; the first request seeks a decision for self and others. The second stop is because of startled doubt and disbelief; the second request is because long cultivation will surely understand. The last stop is because slander will certainly fall into evil; the last request is because sharp roots obtain benefit.\"**

**今師或時云，佛豫知三周得益，前後不俱，故三抑，俟其三請也。**
**The present master sometimes says: the Buddha foresaw that benefit would be obtained in three turnings, and that before and after are not simultaneous; therefore he suppressed three times, waiting for the three requests.**

**就初請為二：一、長行，二、偈頌。長行為二：一、陳疑；二、陳請。陳疑，疑二智；陳請，已請、眾請。**
**Regarding the first request, there are two: prose and verses. The prose has two: stating doubt and stating the request. The doubt doubts the two wisdoms. The request: he already requests, and the assembly requests.**

**頌中有十一行偈，文為六：初、二句，頌疑實智。**
**In the verses there are eleven lines of gāthā. The text has six. First: two sentences versify doubting Real Wisdom.**

**「自說得」下，第二、三行，頌疑權智。**
**From \"self says he attained\" downward: second, three lines versify doubting Provisional Wisdom.**

**「無漏諸」下，第三，有三行，明三乘四眾有疑，上句明羅漢，後二行明緣覺，中間稱「及求涅槃者」，即是明六度菩薩。**
**From \"without outflows\" downward: third, three lines clarify that the three vehicles and four assemblies have doubt. The first sentence clarifies arhats; the latter two lines clarify pratyekabuddhas. In the middle it says \"and those seeking nirvana\"—this clarifies the Six-Pāramitā bodhisattvas.**

**何以得知？上云「逮得涅槃者」，此中稱「及」，及者此菩薩自求涅槃，又以及他，故異二乘，知是菩薩也。**
**How do we know? Above it said \"those who have reached nirvana\"; here it says \"and\". \"And\" means these bodhisattvas seek nirvana for themselves and also reach others; thus they differ from the Two Vehicles—so we know they are bodhisattvas.**

**「於諸」下，第四，有一行半，明身子疑。**
**From \"among all\" downward: fourth, one and a half lines clarifying Śāriputra's doubt.**

**「佛口所生」下，第五、有一行，明佛子疑。**
**From \"born from the Buddha's mouth\" downward: fifth, one line clarifying the Buddha-sons' doubt.**

**「諸天龍」下，第六，二行，總明同疑請也。**
**From \"devas and dragons\" downward: sixth, two lines generally clarifying that they share doubt and request.**

**夫偈頌、長行，可以意推，如其非頌即是長出，於義非急者，不能煩文分擘故略耳。**
**As for verses and prose, one can infer by intent. Where it is not in verse, it is extended in prose. Where the meaning is not urgent, one cannot trouble the text by splitting it into parts—therefore it is brief.**

**從「爾時佛告」下，是二止，更牒疑為請，悉如文(云云)。**
**From \"At that time the Buddha told\" downward are the second and third stops: again restating the doubt as the request—everything is as in the text (etc.).**

### Scholarly Apparatus (Continued)

[^1]: **Non-Abiding Base (Wuzhu Ben)**:
Refers to the ultimate principle of Emptiness/True Suchness which has no fixed abode or characteristics, yet is the ground from which all phenomena (dharmas) arise. A key concept from the *Vimalakirti Sutra*.

[^2]: **Teaching named Real**:
Since the Teaching itself (the verbal expression of truth) is constant and does not undergo the changes of "progress" seen in Practice, it is categorized here as Real/Constant, whereas Practice is Provisional/Changing.

[^3]: **Essence/Function (Abiding/Emerging)**:
"Abiding" in the realization of Truth is the Essence (*Ti*). "Emerging" to interact with the world is the Function (*Yong*). This pairs the internal state (Real) with external application (Provisional).

[^4]: **Opening/Closing**:
"Opening" means revealing the Gradual as a method to reach the Sudden. "Closing" means identifying the Gradual as part of the Sudden. The Gradual in itself is Provisional; when it leads to the Ultimate, it is seen as Real.

[^5]: **One Mind Three Wisdoms (Yixin Sanzhi)**:
The "One Mind Three Wisdoms" is the core Tiantai epistemological framework. It refers to the simultaneous functioning of Three Wisdoms in a single moment of thought (One Mind). The Three Wisdoms are:
1.  **All-Knowledge (Sarvajñatā)**: Knowing Emptiness (breaking illusions of view and thought).
2.  **Path-Knowledge (Mārgajñatā)**: Knowing the Provisional (mastering infinite methods to save beings).
3.  **All-Mode-Knowledge (Sarvākārajñāna)**: Knowing the Middle (perfectly integrating Empty and Provisional).
In the Separate Teaching, these are sequential. In the Perfect Teaching (Tiantai), they are simultaneous ("One Mind").

[^6]: **Separation and Combination (Li-He)**:
*Li* (Separation) refers to viewing the Provisional and Real as distinct (Nine Realms vs Buddha Realm). *He* (Combination) refers to viewing them as integrated (Nine Realms *are* the Buddha Realm). In the Buddha's self-enlightenment, they are combined (One Vehicle). In teaching others, they are separated (Three Vehicles).

[^7]: **Mutual Possession of Ten Realms**:
This is the first seedling of the "Three Thousand Realms in a Single Moment of Thought" (*Yinian Sanqian*). Here Zhiyi states "Hell possesses the Buddha Realm," implying the potential for enlightenment is intrinsic even in the lowest state.

[^8]: **Three Causes of Buddha Nature**:
Zhiyi correlates the Ten Suchnesses with the Three Causes:
*   **Correct Cause (Zhengyin)**: The innate potential/truth (Essence/Real Mark) = "High and Broad Carriage".
*   **Revealing Cause (Liaoyin)**: The wisdom that realizes truth (Nature/Wisdom) = "Great White Ox".
*   **Conditional Cause (Yuanyin)**: The practices that support realization (Mark/Goodness) = "Adornments".

[^9]: **Tathāgatagarbha**:
The "Womb/Embryo of the Tathāgata." Here equated with "Such a Mark" inherent in all beings.

[^10]: **Lotus Sutra Treatise (Fahua Lun)**:
Common shorthand for the *Saddharmapuṇḍarīkopadeśa* (妙法蓮華經優波提舍), traditionally attributed in East Asian scholastic usage to Vasubandhu. Zhiyi cites it here as an interpretive authority for the *Lotus Sutra*.

[^11]: **Sūtra and Upadeśa**:
*Sūtra* refers to the *Lotus Sutra* itself. *Upadeśa* (優波提舍) refers to an explanatory treatise; here, contextually, it points to the *Fahua Lun* (Lotus Sutra Upadeśa/Treatise).

[^12]: **Great Sutra and Mahāyānasaṃgraha**:
"Great Sutra" (大經) commonly refers to the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* in Tiantai usage. The *Mahāyānasaṃgraha* (攝大乘論) is a Yogācāra treatise attributed to Asaṅga.
