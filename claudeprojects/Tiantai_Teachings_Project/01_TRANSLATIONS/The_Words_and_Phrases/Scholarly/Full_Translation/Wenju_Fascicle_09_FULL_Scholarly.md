## CHAPTER 14: PEACEFUL PRACTICES (Continued)

**非遠非近文為三：一、總標境智，二、別釋，三、結成。「觀」者，中道觀智也，「一切法」者，十法界境也。若單論智，智無所觀，故舉一切以顯皆空。「如實」去，別釋也。二邊三諦無一異名「如」，非七方便故名「實」，以實為相故言「如實相」。「不顛倒」者，無八倒也。「不動」者，不為二死所動也。「不退」者，心心寂滅入薩婆若海也。「不轉」者，不如凡夫轉生死，不如二乘轉凡聖。「如虛空」者，但有名字，字不可得，中道觀智亦但有字，求不可得。「無所有性」者，無自、他、共、無因等性也。「一切言語道斷」者，不可思議也。「不生」者，惑智理皆不生也。「不出」者，如來所治，畢竟不復發也。「不起」者，諸方便皆寂滅也。「無名」者，名不能名也。「無相」者，相不能相也。「無所有」者，無二邊之有也。「無量」者，非數法也。「無邊」者，無方所也。「無礙無障」者，遍一切處也。「但以因緣有」者，結也。上直明中道觀慧，今明雙照二邊，理性畢竟清淨如上所說，非解非惑，而從惑因緣生生死，從解因緣生涅槃。又因緣有有於涅槃，從顛倒生者生於生死，此則雙照意顯也。「常樂觀如是等法」者，即三諦等法也。又「但因緣有從顛倒生」者，結不思議三諦境也。「故說」者，不思議教也。「常樂觀」者，結不思議三觀也。又觀一切法空如實相，標觀體；不顛倒去九句，釋觀相。不為二邊八倒所動，名不倒不動；不墮二乘凡夫二地，故云不退不轉。此二句明智用理。非未來故不生，非過去故不出，非現在故不起，《釋論》五十一云「如虛空，無入、無出、無住相」，《攝大乘》亦爾，無未來入處，無過去出處，無現在住處。第四十三云「因邊不起名不出，緣邊不起名不生。」凡有十九句，初一句總，後十八句對《大品》十八空。如實相即第一義空；不顛倒即內空，內無六入我我所；不顛倒不動即外空，外不為六塵流動也；不退者即內外空，十二入空故，故言不退；不轉即空空，空破諸法，諸法是所破，空是能破，無復諸法唯有空在，此空亦空故言空空；空既空故無復能轉，故言不轉也；如虛空即是大空；執方計破故言如虛空；無所有性即畢竟空；諸法無遺餘故，名畢竟空；以畢竟空故，無所有性也，一切言語道斷即一切空，一切空不可說故言語道斷；不生即有為空，有為是因緣和合，既不合即不生，不出即無為空；無名出離，出離法空故名不出；不起即無始空，求原初不可得故無起；無名即性空可解；無相即相空；實無所有即不可得空；無量即有法空；有法即有量，有量既空故言無量無邊即無法空；無法則是邊表，今空故則無邊無礙，即有法無法空；二不可得故言無礙，無障即散空，妨障不可得故言無障。十八空皆是中道正慧，皆名為空，隨十八種境故言十八耳。《大經》云「如來常修十八空義故」，故用十八空，用釋十八句也。**

**The passage on "neither far nor near" has three parts: (1) generally marking object and wisdom; (2) distinct explanation; (3) conclusion. "Contemplation" means the Middle-Way contemplative wisdom; "all dharmas" means the objects of the Ten Dharma Realms. If one speaks only of wisdom, wisdom has nothing to contemplate; therefore "all" is raised to show that all are empty. From "as they really are" onward is the distinct explanation. The two extremes and the Three Truths are neither one nor different; their name is "thus." Not of the Seven Expedients, it is called "real"; taking the real as its mark, it is called "the real mark as it is." "Not inverted" means no eight inversions. "Not moving" means not moved by the two deaths. "Not retreating" means thought after thought is quiescent, entering the sea of Sarvajñā. "Not turning" means not turning in birth-and-death like ordinary people, nor turning between ordinary and holy like the Two Vehicles. "Like space" means only a name; the word cannot be grasped. Middle-Way contemplative wisdom is likewise only a word, sought and not found. "Nature of no-possessing" means no self-, other-, shared-, or causeless nature. "All paths of speech are cut off" means inconceivable. "Not born" means delusion, wisdom, and principle are all unborn. "Not emerging" means what the Tathāgata has cured never arises again. "Not arising" means all expedients are quiescent. "No name" means name cannot name. "No mark" means mark cannot mark. "No possessing" means no existence of the two extremes. "Immeasurable" means not a numerical dharma. "Boundless" means no direction. "Unobstructed, unhindered" means pervading all places. "Exists only by conditions" is the conclusion. Above, it directly clarified Middle-Way contemplative wisdom; now it clarifies the double-illumination of the two extremes. The nature is ultimately pure as stated above—neither understanding nor delusion—yet from deluded conditions arises birth-and-death, and from understanding conditions arises nirvāṇa. Moreover, conditioned existence exists in nirvāṇa; those born from inversion are born in saṃsāra. This reveals the intent of double-illumination. "Always delight in contemplating such dharmas" means the Three Truths and such dharmas. Again, "exists only by conditions, born from inversion" concludes the inconceivable Three-Truths object. "Therefore it is taught" is the inconceivable teaching. "Always delight in contemplating" concludes the inconceivable Threefold Contemplation. Again, to contemplate all dharmas as empty and as the real mark is the heading for the object of contemplation; from "not inverted" through nine phrases explains the characteristics of contemplation. Not moved by the eight inversions of the two extremes is called not inverted and not moving; not falling into the two grounds of the Two Vehicles and ordinary people is called not retreating and not turning. These two phrases clarify the function of wisdom and principle. Not future, therefore not born; not past, therefore not emerging; not present, therefore not arising. The *Treatise* (卷 51) says, "Like space, there is no entering, no departing, no abiding sign"; the *Mahāyānasaṃgraha* says likewise: no place for future entering, no place for past departing, no place for present abiding. The *Treatise* (卷 43) says, "On the side of causes, not arising is called not emerging; on the side of conditions, not arising is called not being born." In all there are nineteen phrases: the first is general; the remaining eighteen correspond to the eighteen emptinesses of the *Great Prajñā*. "Real mark as it is" is the First-Principle emptiness. "Not inverted" is inner emptiness: within, no six sense-bases of self and what belongs to self. "Not inverted and not moving" is outer emptiness: externally not moved by the six dusts. "Not retreating" is inner-outer emptiness: the twelve bases are empty, therefore it is called not retreating. "Not turning" is emptiness of emptiness: emptiness destroys dharmas; dharmas are what is destroyed; emptiness is what destroys. When no dharmas remain, only emptiness remains, and this emptiness is also empty, therefore it is called emptiness of emptiness. Since emptiness is empty, there is nothing left to turn it, therefore it is called not turning. "Like space" is great emptiness; clinging to directions is destroyed, therefore it is like space. "Nature of no-possessing" is ultimate emptiness: dharmas leave nothing remaining, therefore it is called ultimate emptiness; because it is ultimate emptiness, it is nature of no-possessing. "All paths of speech are cut off" is emptiness of all: the emptiness of all cannot be spoken, therefore speech is cut off. "Not born" is emptiness of the conditioned: the conditioned is the harmonization of causes and conditions; since they do not harmonize, it is not born. "Not emerging" is emptiness of the unconditioned; the unconditioned is emancipation, and emancipation-dharma is empty, therefore it is called not emerging. "Not arising" is beginningless emptiness: the origin cannot be found, therefore no arising. "No name" is emptiness of nature; "no mark" is emptiness of marks. "Truly no possessing" is emptiness of the unattainable. "Immeasurable" is emptiness of dharmas with measure; dharmas have measure, and since measure is empty, it is called immeasurable. "Boundless" is emptiness of dharmas without measure; dharmas without measure are boundary-marks, and since they are empty, it is boundless and unobstructed—thus the emptiness of both measurable and non-measurable dharmas. "Unobstructed" means the two are unattainable; "unhindered" is dispersing emptiness, since hindrances are unattainable. The eighteen emptinesses are all Middle-Way right wisdom, all called emptiness; they are said to be eighteen according to the eighteen kinds of objects. The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says, "The Tathāgata constantly cultivates the meaning of the eighteen emptinesses"; therefore the eighteen emptinesses are used to explain the eighteen phrases.**

**偈有二十八行三句，為三：初一行，頌標章；次二十二行，頌修行；後五行三句，明行成。長行行、近別釋，偈中合頌，正言意同開合互現，廣略之解彌復可依。上行、近二文各有三，今偈合頌不復次第。初、「應入行」下十四行，頌事遠近，上有十種遠離，頌中略不次第，在文可見。亦是頌人空行處，取意即兼頌近處三意，故偈云「是則名為行處近處」。「常離國王」者，比丘親近國王有十非法：一、陰謀王命，二、王誅大臣，三、典藏亡寶，四、宮人懷妊，五、王身中毒，六、大臣諍競，七、二國交兵，八、王悋不施民，九、歛民物，十、多疾疫，謂比丘行呪。有此十事，一切臣民謂是比丘所作，作此謗比丘，即謗法亦謗佛，故佛不令親近王也。「外道梵志」者，《摩隥伽經》云「初人名梵天造一韋陀。次名白淨，變一為四：一名讚誦韋陀，二名祭祀，三名歌詠，四名禳災。一一各三十二萬偈，合成一百二十八萬偈，有一千七百卷也。次名弗沙，有二十五弟子，各於一韋陀能廣分別，遂有二十五韋陀。次有人名鸚鵡，變一韋陀為十八。次有人名善道，有二十一弟子，變為二十一韋陀。如是展轉變為千二百六韋陀也。」毘陀論此云智論，婆耶娑造，凡四種：一信力毘陀，明事火滅罪；二、耶受毘陀，明供養婆羅門得福；三、娑摩毘陀，明和合二國；四、阿陀婆毘陀，明鬪戰。讀此四論自稱一切智人。毘伽羅此名記論，婆尼尼造，明種種經書并諸雜語。衛世師論，優留佉造，此翻最勝，出世八百年明六諦。迦毘羅此翻黃頭，亦云龜種，造論名僧佉，僧佉此云無頂，因人名論故言迦毘羅，說二十五諦。「小乘三藏學者」，佛在波羅柰，最初為五人說契經修多羅藏；佛在羅閱祇，最初為須那提說毘尼藏；佛在毘舍離獼猴池，最初為跋耆子說阿毘曇藏。五百羅漢初夜集阿毘曇藏《相續解脫經》，此為三藏學也。「深著五欲」，欲相者，四天下人、龍、須輪、四天王皆根相到，忉利天以風為事，炎天相近為事，兜率相牽為事，化樂天相視為事，他化自在心念為事，上天皆離欲。「寡女處女」者，阿難問佛：如來滅後見女人云何？佛言：勿與相見，設見勿共語，設共語當專心念佛。「及諸不男」，彼名般吒者，此翻黃門。黃門者，有男女形不能男女。「入里乞食」者，《雜阿含》云「有一羊往糞聚飽食，還群貢高我得好食，比丘亦如是，得四事已起染著欲想不知出要，設不得，恒生想，設得，向諸比丘貢高毀篾他人，我得彼不能得，是為羊比丘乞食。師子王遇大獸即噉，不味不著，得小獸即噉，不鄙不薄；比丘亦爾，得四事供養不起染著無有欲想自知出要，設不得利養，不起亂念無增減心，是為師子王比丘乞食。乞食行役病四事，而前後八時明八精進、八懈怠。乞食前作是念，為修道補飢瘡，乞雖未得不廢念行；乞食得已，為報恩念道不輟，前後兩時倍加精進。餘三事前後亦如是，反此名八懈怠。《寶雲經》明乞食作四分：一分奉同梵行，一分與匃人，一分施鬼神，一分自食。**

**The verses have twenty-eight lines and three phrases, divided into three parts: the first line praises the heading; the next twenty-two lines praise the practice; the final five lines and three phrases clarify the completion of practice. The prose has the practice and the near part explained separately; in the verses they are combined in praise. The stated intent is the same, opening and closing interappear, and broad and concise explanations can be relied upon. Above, the practice and the near prose each have three parts; now the verses combine the praise without sequence. First, from "should enter practice" downward fourteen lines praise the far/near matters. Above there are ten kinds of distancing; in the verses the order is abbreviated and not sequential, as can be seen in the text. This also praises the "person-emptiness practice place"; taking the intent, it also praises the three meanings of the near-place, hence the verse says, "This is called the practice-place and the near-place." "Always keep distant from kings" means: when a bhikṣu draws near a king there are ten illegal matters: (1) plotting the king's command; (2) the king executing ministers; (3) losing stored treasure; (4) palace women being pregnant; (5) the king's body being poisoned; (6) ministers arguing; (7) two countries at war; (8) the king being stingy and not giving to the people; (9) levying the people's goods; (10) many diseases and epidemics—saying the bhikṣu performs spells. If these ten matters occur, all ministers and people say the bhikṣu did it. To slander the bhikṣu in this way is to slander the Dharma and the Buddha, therefore the Buddha forbids approaching kings. "Non-Buddhist Brahmans": the *Mātanga Sūtra* says, "The first person named Brahmā composed one Veda. The next, named White Purity, transformed one into four: one called the Veda of Praise and Recitation; second, the Veda of Sacrifice; third, the Veda of Songs; fourth, the Veda of Averting Calamity. Each has 320,000 verses; together they become 1,280,000 verses, in 1,700 scrolls. Next, one named Fuṣa had twenty-five disciples, each able to broadly explicate one Veda, thus there were twenty-five Vedas. Next, a person named Parrot transformed one Veda into eighteen. Next, a person named Good Path had twenty-one disciples, transforming [it] into twenty-one Vedas. Thus, by successive transformations, they became 1,206 Vedas." The Veda Treatises are called the "Treatise on Wisdom" and were composed by Vyāsa. There are four kinds: (1) the Faith-Power Veda, which explains that offering fire extinguishes sin; (2) the Yashou Veda, which explains that offerings to Brahmans gain merit; (3) the Sāma Veda, which explains harmonizing two kingdoms; (4) the Atharva Veda, which explains warfare. Reading these four treatises, they call themselves omniscient. Vyākaraṇa is called the "Records Treatise" and was composed by Pāṇini; it explains various scriptures and mixed languages. The Vaiśeṣika Treatise was composed by Uluḍha; it translates as "Most Excellent" and, eight hundred years after the Buddha, clarified the six truths. Kapila translates as "Yellow-Head," also "Tortoise Lineage"; he composed the treatise called Sāṃkhya. "Sāṃkhya" translates as "without crown"; because the treatise is named after the person, it is called Kapila. It teaches the twenty-five tattvas. "Students of the Small Vehicle Tripiṭaka": when the Buddha was in Vārāṇasī, he first taught the Sutra Basket to five people; when the Buddha was in Rājagṛha, he first taught the Vinaya Basket to Sunati; when the Buddha was at the Monkey Pond in Vaiśālī, he first taught the Abhidharma Basket to the Vajjiputra. Five hundred arhats, in the first night, compiled the Abhidharma Basket, the *Continuity Liberation Sūtra*; this is the Tripiṭaka study. "Deeply attached to the five desires": regarding the appearance of desire, people of the four continents, dragons, Sūlun, and the Four Heavenly Kings all have desires arising from the root-contact. The Trāyastriṃśa Heaven takes wind as its activity; the Yāma Heaven takes proximity as its activity; the Tuṣita Heaven takes mutual pulling as its activity; the Nirmāṇarati Heaven takes mutual seeing as its activity; the Paranirmitavaśavartin Heaven takes mental thought as its activity. The higher heavens are all free from desire. "Widows and virgins": Ānanda asked the Buddha, "After the Tathāgata's extinction, how should one see women?" The Buddha said: do not meet them; if you meet them, do not speak; if you speak, then single-mindedly contemplate the Buddha. "And all who are not male": those called *paṇḍaka* translate as "huangmen" (eunuch). A "huangmen" has male and female forms but cannot be male or female. "Entering the village for alms": the *Saṃyukta Āgama* says, "A sheep went to a pile of dung and ate until full, then returned to its herd boasting, 'I got good food.' A bhikṣu is like this: having obtained the four requisites, he gives rise to craving and desire and does not know the way out. If he does not obtain [them], he always gives rise to thoughts; if he obtains them, he boasts to the other bhikṣus, belittling others: 'I obtained it; he did not obtain it.' This is the sheep-bhikṣu begging for food. The Lion King, encountering a great beast, immediately devours it without savoring or attaching; encountering a small beast, he immediately devours it without despising or slighting. A bhikṣu is likewise: receiving offerings of the four requisites, he does not give rise to craving and desire and knows his way out. If he does not obtain offerings, he does not give rise to confused thoughts and has neither increase nor decrease of mind; this is the Lion-King bhikṣu begging for food. Begging for food, doing services, illness, and the four requisites: in the times before and after there are eight periods clarifying eight diligences and eight laxities. Before begging, he thinks: for cultivating the Way and patching the hunger-sore. Though he has not obtained, he does not abandon the practice of mindfulness. After obtaining food, he thinks of repaying恩 and does not cease the path; thus, before and after he doubles his diligence. The other three matters are likewise before and after; the opposite is called the eight laxities." The *Jeweled Cloud Sūtra* clarifies that alms are divided into four portions: one portion supports the same brahma-practice, one portion is given to beggars, one portion is offered to ghosts and spirits, and one portion is eaten by oneself.**

**「又復不行」下，第二，八行，頌非遠非近理遠近處。**

**From "Moreover, do not practice" downward, this is the second: eight lines praising the principle of neither far nor near and the far/near practice-places.**

---

**「若有比丘」下，第三，五行三句，明行成，又三：初一行半，標行成。事成外儀無失，理成內心無滯，故云「無怯弱」也。次「菩薩有時」下，第二，三行，行成而得安樂。後，一行一句，頌長行總結。「菩薩入靜室」下，釋安樂之因。因修禪定止於過惡，得人無我外則不損，因修智慧離諸取著，得法無我內無顛倒，是則心不怯弱，不怯弱名安樂也。「文殊」下，第三，一行一句，頌長行總結也。**

**From "If there is a bhikṣu" downward, this is the third: five lines and three phrases clarifying the completion of practice, again in three parts. First, one and a half lines mark completion. When practice is complete, external deportment has no loss; when principle is complete, the inner mind has no obstruction; therefore it is said "without timidity." Next, from "At times a bodhisattva...," three lines, practice is complete and one attains peace and joy. Last, one line and one phrase praises the prose conclusion. From "The bodhisattva enters a quiet room" downward, it explains the cause of peace and joy. Because one cultivates dhyāna and samādhi, one halts prior evils; one attains no-self of persons, and thus externally does not harm. Because one cultivates wisdom and departs all grasping and attachment, one attains no-self of dharmas, and thus internally there is no inversion. Therefore the mind is not timid; not timid is called peace and joy. From "Mañjuśrī" downward, one line and one phrase praise the prose conclusion.**

**第二，口安樂行，亦長行、偈頌。長行為二：一、標章，二、釋行法。標章如文。「若口宣說」下，釋行法，又二：謂止行、觀行。止為四：一、不說過，二、不輕慢，三、不歎毀，四、不怨嫌。初、不樂說人經過者，人聽有過，法有何過？七方便法是佛隨他意語，名不了義，若過其法則惱其人，非安樂行相也。二、「亦不輕慢」者，不倚圓篾偏、重實輕權也。三、不說他人長短者，初不說一切人，次別舉聲聞。夫人惡聞其失故不譚短，面譽對毀故不稱長，亦不約張說趙長，趙謂以他長譏己短、寄彼諷此，亦不得向張說趙短，背毀於彼亦復背毀於我，為此義故善惡俱止也。又「不說長短」者，《日藏》第一云「初中後夜減省睡眠，精進坐禪誦經修道，背捨生死向涅槃路，不稱他短不說己長，謙下卑遜不自憍高，衣食知足頭陀精進不放逸行，係念思惟心不馳散，於一切眾生起慈悲心。」又如修多羅所說空行，自讀誦、教人讀誦，不謗他、不說他過、不稱己長。於聲聞人又根性不定，若歎二乘或令彼退大取小，若毀呰二乘，或令其大小俱失兩無所取也。四、「不生怨嫌心」者，若謂其人法妨害我道即是怨心，謂其鄙劣即是嫌心，心機一動聲說即發，杜說過之源故不生怨嫌也。**

**Second: the peaceful practice of the mouth, also with prose and verses. The prose has two parts: (1) marking the heading, (2) explaining the practice-method. The heading is as in the text. From "If one preaches by mouth" downward, it explains the practice-method, again in two: cessation-practice and contemplation-practice. Cessation has four: (1) not speaking faults, (2) not slighting, (3) not praising or slandering, (4) not giving rise to resentment or aversion. First, not delighting in speaking of people's past faults: people hear and have faults, but what fault does the Dharma have? The Seven Expedient Dharmas are the Buddha's words according to others' intent, called provisional; if one faults those dharmas one troubles those persons—this is not the mark of peaceful practice. Second, "also not slighting" means not leaning on the Perfect to disparage the Partial, not valuing the Real and despising the Provisional. Third, not speaking of others' long and short points: first, not speaking of anyone at all; next, specifically the śrāvakas. People dislike hearing their faults, therefore do not speak their shortcomings. To praise to the face and condemn behind is not to call them long [good]. Nor should one speak of Zhang's strengths to Zhao, for Zhao will take another's strengths to mock one's own weaknesses, using him to satirize this; nor should one speak of Zhao's faults to Zhang—backbiting others is also backbiting oneself. For this reason, both praise and blame are stopped. Again, "not speaking of long and short": the first fascicle of the *Sun Treasury Sūtra* says, "In the first, middle, and last watches of the night, reduce sleep, diligently sit in meditation and recite sutras to cultivate the path, turn away from birth-and-death toward the road of nirvāṇa. Do not praise others' faults and do not speak one's own strengths. Be humble and deferential, not arrogant. Be content with clothing and food; practice dhūta and diligence without laxity. Tie thoughts and contemplate so the mind does not scatter. Toward all beings give rise to compassionate mind." Likewise, as the sutras say regarding empty practice: read, recite, and teach others to read and recite; do not slander others, do not speak others' faults, do not call one's own strengths. For śrāvakas their capacities are also unsettled: if one praises the Two Vehicles, one may cause them to retreat from the Great and take the Small; if one disparages the Two Vehicles, one may cause them to lose both Great and Small, obtaining neither. Fourth, "not giving rise to resentment or aversion": if one thinks that a person's Dharma obstructs my path, that is resentment; if one thinks he is inferior, that is aversion. When the mind-mechanism moves, speech immediately issues; to block the source of speaking faults, therefore do not give rise to resentment or aversion.**

**「善修如是」下，觀行門也。觀諸法空，無所取著心不苟執，不逆人意不違法相，則不說小乘法答。「但以大乘答」者，若見無大機而說小，得方便益；若不見無大而說小，妨其大緣；等是不見，但說大無咎。**

**From "Well cultivate thus" downward is the contemplation-practice gate. Contemplate all dharmas as empty, with nothing to grasp or attach; the mind does not rashly cling, does not oppose others' intent, does not violate the Dharma-mark; thus one does not answer with Small Vehicle dharmas. "Answer only with the Great Vehicle" means: if one sees there is no Great Vehicle capacity and speaks the Small, one gains the benefit of expedient means; if one does not see that there is no Great capacity and yet speaks the Small, one obstructs their Great affinity. If it is equally not seen, then to speak only the Great has no fault.**

**偈有十六行半，為三：初二行，頌標章；次九行半，頌前行法；後五行，明行成。初二行，頌上住安樂行。上總稱應住，頌中別出行相。行相者有三：「安隱說法」者半行，欲令前人得安隱道及果，即入室義；「清淨地」等半行，即坐座義；「油塗身」等一行，即著衣義。三法導口業名安樂行。「安處法座」下九行半，頌行，為二：初五行半，頌止行；次四行，頌觀行。上止行有四，今具頌。初「隨問為說」半行，頌不輕慢，慢則不隨。「若有比丘」至「隨義答」，二，二行半，頌不說長短，但依義不譚人好惡。「若有難問隨義答」者有二：一、可答，二、不可答。問答相難詰相上下，若勝負則自知，是為智者語；是放恣敢有違者誅之，是為王者語；長短是非皆不知，唯覓勝而已，是為愚者語。「因緣譬喻」去至「入於佛道」，三，一行半，追頌不樂說人法過。若說人過生人毒念，今不說過故，使發心入佛道，佛道從喜生也。「除懶惰意」，四，一行，頌無怨嫌。怨嫌心起則懈懶憂惱，今以慈心說法無怨嫌者，精進無憂。上長行皆約止善說，頌中皆約行善也。**

**The verses have sixteen and a half lines, divided into three: the first two lines praise the heading; the next nine and a half lines praise the foregoing practice-methods; the last five lines clarify completion of practice. The first two lines praise abiding in the peaceful practice above. Above it generally says one should abide; in the verses the characteristics of practice are separately produced. The characteristics are three: "peacefully and safely preaching the Dharma"—half a line—means wishing that the former person attain the peaceful path and its fruit, which is the meaning of entering the room; "pure ground" and the like—half a line—means the meaning of sitting on the seat; "oiling the body" and the like—one line—means the meaning of wearing the robe. These three dharmas guide the mouth-karma and are called the peaceful practice. From "peacefully abiding on the Dharma-seat" downward, nine and a half lines praise the practice in two parts: the first five and a half lines praise cessation-practice; the next four lines praise contemplation-practice. The cessation-practice above has four; now all are praised. First, "answer according to the question"—half a line—praises not slighting; if one is arrogant one does not follow. "If there is a bhikṣu" up to "answer according to meaning"—two and a half lines—praise not speaking of long and short points, only following meaning and not talking of others' likes and dislikes. "If there are difficult questions, answer according to meaning" has two: (1) answerable, (2) not answerable. In question-and-answer, there is challenging and being challenged, rising and falling; if there is victory or defeat, one knows oneself—this is the speech of the wise. If one is licentious and any who oppose are punished, this is the speech of kings. If one knows nothing of long and short, right and wrong, and only seeks victory, this is the speech of the foolish. "Causes and conditions, parables" down to "entering the Buddha path"—one and a half lines—retroactively praise not delighting in speaking of others' Dharma faults. If one speaks others' faults, poison-thoughts arise in people; now by not speaking faults, one causes them to arouse the mind and enter the Buddha path, and the Buddha path arises from joy. "Remove slothful intent"—one line—praises no resentment or aversion. When resentment arises, sloth and anxiety arise; now one preaches the Dharma with a compassionate mind and no resentment, and diligence is without sorrow. The prose above is all cessation good-speech; in the verses it is all practice good-speech.**

**From "day and night constantly proclaim the unsurpassed teaching of the Way" onward is the second: four lines praising the contemplation gate above. Above it says "answer only with the Great Vehicle"; the verse says "preach the unsurpassed Way." Above it says "cause them to obtain all-seed wisdom"; the verse says "vow to accomplish the Buddha Way." From "after my extinction" downward is the third: five-line verse clarifying the completion of the peaceful practice of the mouth. First line marks completion. Next, from "without jealousy" downward—two lines—clarifies that when there are no inner faults, outer difficulties do not arise, like flies not coming when there is no stench. Next, from "the wise are thus" downward—one line—clarifies that inner good dharmas are the reason practice is completed. "As I said above": if there is no inner fault, it is as in the prose; if there are inner good dharmas, it is as in the verse. Next, from "his merit" downward—one line—measures merit, as in the text.**

**第三，意安樂行，亦長行、偈頌。長行亦為三：標章、釋行、結成。釋中亦先止、後觀。止中有四：一、不嫉諂，二、不輕罵，三、不惱亂，四、不諍競。夫二乘欲速出生死先除貪欲，菩薩先除瞋見，嫉是瞋垢、諂是見垢，嫉忌違慈悲之心，非化他之法，諂誑乖智慧之道，非自行之法，智慧被障將何上求？慈悲苟妨將何下化？安樂行菩薩最須棄之。「亦勿輕罵」下，不應以圓行呵別，知機可責、不知勿罵，容有退善根義。「比丘」下，不應以圓呵通，其本無大機，強以圓呵乖心成惱，通既被呵圓復未解，前疑後悔大小俱失。去道紆迴名「甚遠」，此惱別行人；沈空取證名「不得」，此惱通人。厭生死名「懈怠」，《悲花》明小乘者為懈怠。「起大悲心」去，明觀行，亦為四：約前四惡而起於行善，一「於一切起大悲」，違於嫉諂。二「於如來起慈父心」，違於輕罵。凡求佛道即是學人，敬學如佛不得輕罵。「諸」者通三世，此即未來如來也。三「於菩薩起大師想」，違於惱亂。理論三乘皆是菩薩，有化訓德、皆眾生師，應起師想，勿言其短。四「平等說法」，違於諍論，平等破偏執諍也，不多不少量器利鈍也。「文殊」下，結行成，又二：一、由止惡惡不能加，故云「無能惱亂」；二、由觀行故勝人來集，「得好同學」也。**

**Third: the peaceful practice of the mind, also prose and verses. The prose has three: heading, explaining practice, and conclusion. In the explanation, first cessation, then contemplation. In cessation there are four: (1) not jealous and flattering; (2) not lightly reviling; (3) not vexing and confusing; (4) not contending. The Two Vehicles wish to quickly exit birth-and-death, therefore they first remove craving; bodhisattvas first remove anger and views. Jealousy is the filth of anger, flattery the filth of views. Jealousy violates the compassionate mind and is not the method of transforming others; flattery and deceit oppose the path of wisdom and are not the method of self-practice. If wisdom is obstructed, how can one seek upward? If compassion is hindered, how can one transform downward? Therefore the bodhisattva of peaceful practice must abandon these. From "also do not lightly revile" downward: do not, by the Perfect practice, scold those of the Distinct; if one knows the capacity, one may admonish, but if one does not know, do not revile, for it might cause regression of good roots. From "bhikṣu" downward: do not use the Perfect to scold those of the Shared; they originally lack Great Vehicle capacity; if one forces the Perfect and scolds, it conflicts with their mind and becomes vexation. The Shared are scolded and the Perfect is still not understood; earlier doubts and later regrets cause both Great and Small to be lost. The path is circuitous and far, called "very far"—this vexes those in the Distinct practice. Sinking into emptiness and grasping attainment is called "not attaining"—this vexes those in the Shared. Loathing birth-and-death is called "laziness"; the *Compassionate Flower* clarifies that the Small Vehicle is laziness. From "arouse great compassion" onward clarifies contemplation-practice, also in four, arising from the previous four evils into good practice: (1) "toward all, arouse great compassion," countering jealousy and flattery; (2) "toward the Tathāgata, arouse the mind of a compassionate father," countering light reviling. All who seek the Buddha Way are learners; respect learning as the Buddha, and do not lightly revile. "All" refers to the three times; this is the future Tathāgata. (3) "Toward bodhisattvas, arouse the thought of a great teacher," countering vexation: in principle, the Three Vehicles are all bodhisattvas; having the virtue of transforming and training, all are teachers of beings. One should arouse the thought of a teacher and not speak their shortcomings. (4) "Preach the Dharma equally," countering contention: equality breaks partial, contentious grasping; neither too much nor too little, according to the capacity, sharp or dull. From "Mañjuśrī" downward, it concludes completion in two: (1) by ceasing evil, evil cannot add, therefore it is said "none can vex or confuse"; (2) by contemplation-practice, superior persons gather, thus "attain good fellow students."**

**Fourth: the peaceful practice of vows, in two: first prose, second verses. The prose is again in two: first clarifying the practice-method, second praising the sutra. Regarding the practice-method, there are three: heading, practice-method, and conclusion. The heading is as in the text.**

---

**行法為三：初「在家出家」去，明標誓願境；二、從「應作是念」去，明起誓願之由；三、從「我得」去，正立誓願。初明慈誓境，通取曾發方便心者，而未出三界名在家，斷通惑盡名出家，此攝得兩種二乘、三種菩薩，此輩亦具無明，亦應是大悲境，但其皆曾發心，與慈誓相應，須與其圓道圓果之樂，故言「生大慈心」耳。悲境者非菩薩人，通取未曾發方便心者，名「非菩薩」。全不歸向方便，況復真實。此悲境攝得一切三界內者，此等亦須與樂，但其流轉無際，正與悲誓相應，宜拔其罪因罪果，故言「生大悲心」耳。從「應作是念」至「隨宜說法」者，即起慈之由。由諸樂小執佛方便以為真實，不會圓道故言「大失」，大失是慈誓之由。從「不聞不知」去，是悲誓之由。由未發偏圓心、不聞偏圓二道故，以不聞偏道無聞慧，不知者無思慧，不覺者無修慧。又無圓三慧。何者？不問故不聞，不信故不知，不解故不修，偏圓三慧權實皆無，甚可憐愍，起悲之由。從「其人雖不問不信此經」去，正發誓願。彼雖不問不信偏圓二道，菩薩不約偏發誓，但欲與其圓道三慧，故言「雖不問不信此經，我得三菩提引令得入」也。誓願、菩提、智慧、神通，皆約安樂行得。何者？深觀如來座，故得智慧力，四辯莊嚴，能以慧拔也；深觀如來室、如來衣，得大善寂力，不起滅定現諸威儀；神通福德莊嚴先以定動也。**

**The practice-method is in three: first, from "householder and renunciant" onward, clarifying the object of the vow; second, from "should make this thought" onward, clarifying the cause for arousing the vow; third, from "when I attain" onward, establishing the vow itself. First clarifies the object of the compassionate vow: it generally includes those who have once aroused the expedient mind but have not yet left the three realms, called householders; those who have cut off shared delusions to exhaustion are called renunciants. This includes two kinds of Two Vehicles and three kinds of bodhisattvas. These too still possess ignorance and should also be objects of great compassion; yet because they have already aroused the mind, they accord with the compassionate vow, and one must give them the joy of the Perfect path and Perfect fruit; therefore it says "give rise to great loving-kindness." The object of compassion are those who are not bodhisattvas; it generally includes those who have not yet aroused the expedient mind, called "non-bodhisattvas." They do not return to expedients at all, much less the real. This object of compassion includes all within the three realms. They too must be given joy, but their wandering has no limit; they match the compassionate vow, and one should extract their karmic causes and karmic results of罪, therefore it says "give rise to great compassion." From "should make this thought" to "speak the Dharma according to what is appropriate" is the cause for arousing loving-kindness. Because those who delight in the small grasp the Buddha's expedients as real, not understanding the Perfect path, it is called "great loss"; that great loss is the cause for the compassionate vow. From "do not hear and do not know" onward is the cause for the vow of compassion. Because they have not aroused the mind for Partial and Perfect, and do not hear the two paths of Partial and Perfect, not hearing the Partial path means no hearing-wisdom; not knowing means no contemplation-wisdom; not awakening means no cultivation-wisdom. Moreover, they lack the three Perfect wisdoms. Why? Not asking means not hearing; not believing means not knowing; not understanding means not cultivating. The three wisdoms of Partial and Perfect, expedient and real, are all absent—pitiful indeed; thus arises the cause for compassion. From "Although that person does not ask and does not believe this sutra" onward, one properly arouses the vow. Although they do not ask and do not believe the two paths of Partial and Perfect, the bodhisattva does not vow in terms of the Partial; he only wishes to give them the three wisdoms of the Perfect path, therefore it says, "Though he does not ask and does not believe this sutra, when I attain unsurpassed bodhi I will lead him to enter." Vow, bodhi, wisdom, and supernatural powers are all obtained through the peaceful practice. Why? By deeply contemplating the Tathāgata's seat, one gains the power of wisdom; adorned with the four eloquences, one can rescue by wisdom. By deeply contemplating the Tathāgata's room and the Tathāgata's robe, one gains the power of great善寂; without entering cessation-samādhi one manifests all dignified deportments. Supernatural powers and the adornment of merit are first moved by concentration.**

**從「文殊」去，是結行成，為三：初、總結無過失則是行成。行云何成？以其立大誓願故，入如來室行成；以其知四眾失圓道故，即如來座行成；以其誓制其心不懈怠故，如來衣行成。三行具立，故言行成。「無過失」者，慈悲成故無瞋垢失，如來衣成故無懈怠，如來座成故無諂曲也。「常為比丘」下，第二、別結慈悲行成。以慈成故攝得四眾人天供養聽法；誓願成故感佛神通諸天作護；如來座成聽者歡喜。「所以」下，第三、釋誓行成。三世佛尚守護，況諸天耶？**

**From "Mañjuśrī" onward is the concluding completion of practice, in three: first, a general conclusion that absence of faults is completion. How is practice completed? Because one establishes a great vow, the practice of entering the Tathāgata's room is completed; because one knows that the four assemblies lose the Perfect path, the practice of the Tathāgata's seat is completed; because one vows to restrain the mind and not be lax, the practice of the Tathāgata's robe is completed. With the three practices fully established, it is called completion. "Without faults" means: because compassion is completed, there is no fault of anger-filth; because the Tathāgata's robe is completed, there is no laxity; because the Tathāgata's seat is completed, there is no flattery or crookedness. From "always being bhikṣus" downward is the second: a separate conclusion of compassionate practice. Because loving-kindness is completed, the four assemblies and humans and gods are gathered to offer and listen to the Dharma; because vows are completed, one感佛神通 and the gods act as protection; because the Tathāgata's seat is completed, the listeners rejoice. From "therefore" downward is the third: explaining completion of the vow-practice. The Buddhas of the three times still protect, how much more the gods.**

**From "Mañjuśrī" down to "this is the Lotus" is the second: praising the sutra as difficult to hear. It is again two: dharma-explanation and parable-explanation. The dharma-explanation is also two: (1) in the past it had never been openly preached, therefore it was not obtained; (2) today it is obtained. The parable-explanation is also two: (1) the parable of not giving the jewel, illustrating that in the past it was not openly preached; (2) the parable of giving the jewel, illustrating that today it is heard. Each of the two parables has opening and closing. The "not giving the jewel" parable has six: (1) subduing the various countries by威; (2) small kings not obeying; (3) raising armies to punish; (4) rejoicing in merit; (5) rewarding according to merit; (6) yet not giving the jewel. The "Wheel-Turning King" is a metaphor for the Tathāgata transforming the world; "subduing countries" is a metaphor for the aggregates, realms, and sense-bases subduing all objects. Second, the "small kings" are a metaphor for afflictions and the like; they have not yet been subdued by the unconditioned, thus are called "not obeying their command." Third, "raising various armies" is a metaphor: among the seven worthy stages, the method-practice is the vanguard; among the srotaāpanna and sakṛdāgāmin stages, the method-practice is the middle army; among the anāgāmin and arhat stages, the method-practice is the rear army. What is destroyed are the thieves and bandits of the three poisons, divided into eighty-four thousand; what destroys them are the officer-soldiers of the eighty-four thousand Dharma gates. From "the king sees the army" downward is the fourth: rejoicing in merit. From "rewards according to merit" downward is the fifth: rewarding according to merit—"fields" are samādhi; "houses" are wisdom; "villages" are the first and second fruits; "towns" are the third fruit; "cities" are nirvāṇa; "clothing" is wholesome dharmas of shame and patience; "adornments for the body" are wholesome dharmas that assist the path; "various seven treasures" are the seven factors of awakening; "elephants, horses, and vehicles" are the Two Vehicles' exhausted non-arising wisdom; "servants" are supernatural powers; obtaining conditioned wholesome dharmas are like "people." From "only in the topknot" downward is the sixth: not giving the jewel. Those who exit the portioned birth-and-death are minor merits; those who exit the changed birth-and-death are great merits. "Amazed" means: those without great merit are suddenly given the topknot jewel; all ministers are amazed. This is a metaphor for sentient beings whose great capacity has not yet moved and who suddenly hear this sutra: the Two Vehicles doubt and bodhisattvas are amazed. The six parables match the text one by one.**

**From "Mañjuśrī, like a wheel-turning king" downward is the parable of giving the jewel, also in two: (1) having great merit, (2) giving the jewel. "Bright jewel": the brightness is a metaphor for Middle-Way wisdom; the round is a metaphor for permanence. "On the crown" means the ultimate fruit is revered; "in the topknot" means the Real is hidden by the Provisional; loosening the topknot is opening the Provisional; giving the jewel is revealing the Real. The matching is also two: "able to lead to all-wisdom"—wisdom is the name of the fruit; this is the One of practice. "The foremost teaching" is the One of teaching. "Secret treasury" is the One of principle, also including the One of persons.**

**The verses have fourteen and a half lines, divided into two: the first four lines praise the practice-method above; the next ten and a half lines praise the sutra as difficult to hear. The first praise of practice has two: first one line, a superimposed praise of completion. Above it generally clarifies completion; here the verse separately displays it. "Always practice patience" praises completion of wearing the robe; "pity all" praises completion of entering the room; "only then can one expound" praises completion of sitting on the seat. Next, from "in the latter evil age" downward—three lines—praise the practice-method. Above there were three (object, cause, vow); the verse fully praises them. Next, from "like a powerful man" downward—ten and a half lines—praise the above difficulty of hearing the Dharma. Above there were dharma, parable, and matching; here only the parable and matching are praised. The parable is in two: the first three lines praise not giving the jewel; next, from "if there is a brave one" downward, one line praises giving the jewel. Next, from "the Tathāgata is also thus" downward is the matching: first three and a half lines praise the matching to not giving the jewel; next, from "having known beings" downward, three lines praise the matching to giving the jewel. The detailed divisions are as stated (云云).**

**From "after my extinction" downward, twenty-three lines: this is the third part of the chapter, summarizing the signs of practice-completion and responsive verification in order to encourage cultivation. It has three parts: first, one and a half lines concluding and encouraging the four practices; second, twenty and a half lines citing three kinds of retribution to encourage—also called the purification of the three obstacles; last, one line concluding. When the three obstacles are purified and transformed, present-life and future-life evil karma is exhausted, and one obtains superior retribution in this life and later. The first line, "without sorrow or vexation," is the transformation of the retribution obstacle, transforming present retribution. Second, the half line "not born in poverty" is the transformation of the karma obstacle, transforming rebirth. Third, from "beings delight to see" downward, nineteen lines: the affliction obstacle is transformed and later retribution is transformed. Now first, the one line "reading this sutra" extinguishes present-life sorrow and vexation, immediately removing the retribution of painful feeling; this transforms the present-retribution mind, and the absence of illnesses and pains is the transformation of the retribution-body. From "not born in poverty" downward, the second half-line transforms evil karma: evil karma should bring evil fruit; the sutra's power transforms evil causes and gains good fruit—this is transformation of rebirth retribution. "Not born" means no evil rebirth karma; in the present, holding the sutra does not make poverty-karma; in future lives one is not born lowly. From "beings delight to see" downward, nineteen lines clarify transformation of later retribution, transforming the three affliction obstacles. This has two parts: first three lines distinctly clarify transformation of the three affliction obstacles; second, sixteen lines generally clarify transformation of all obstacles. The first has three: first, one line from "beings delight to see" distinctly clarifies transformation of the greed obstacle. Those with many desires are despised by people and are obstructed from being born in the Brahma heavens; when the desire obstacle is transformed, people delight to see them, and heavenly youths attend them. From "blades and staffs do not harm" downward, second, one and a half lines distinctly clarify transformation of the anger obstacle. Abandoning anger removes inner knives and arrows; entering battle, outer blades do not wound. From "wisdom light" downward, half a line is the third, clarifying transformation of the ignorance obstacle. From "if in a dream one dreams of wondrous things" downward, second: sixteen lines generally clarify transformation of all affliction obstacles; this is also transformation of later retribution. Holding the sutra and presently感 these signs, one should know that in the past they were long since accomplished; now they are aroused by conditions. Moreover, there are signs of causes and fruits of Buddhahood; all are later retribution, therefore in dreams one sees the signs of future later retribution. Events of hundreds of thousands of myriads of kalpas are within one dream-thought, showing that the wondrous Dharma is inconceivable: the many within the one and the one within the many. These signs appear first, later the fruit will be realized. Again there are six parts: from initial faith to wondrous awakening and the eight phases of Buddhahood, all are the Tathāgata's adornment and self-adornment, which is the retribution of patience. Concerning the first three lines—dreaming entry into the ten faiths—there are two: first two and a half lines are the retribution of compassion; next half line is the retribution of correct view without ignorance. Next, from "again seeing the Buddhas" downward, second: six and a half lines, dreaming entry into the ten abodes. Next, from "again seeing oneself in" downward, third: three phrases, dreaming cultivation of the ten practices. Next, from "attaining the real marks" downward, fourth: one phrase, dreaming awakening to the ten dedications. Next, from "deep entering dhyāna" downward, fifth: half a line, dreaming entry into the ten grounds. Next, from "Buddhas' bodies of gold" downward, sixth: five lines, dreaming entry into wondrous awakening. Since it says "attaining non-retreating wisdom is itself a prediction," know that this is entering the first abode, the position of prediction attained by the unborn. "Again seeing oneself in mountains and forests" shows the ten practices cultivating good dharmas. "Attaining the real marks" shows the ten dedications, the position of correctly contemplating the Middle Way. "Deep entering dhyāna" is the stainless samādhi in the tenth ground; entering the vajra-samādhi, all Buddhas appear and rub the crown, bestowing the office. Dreaming the Buddha of the eight phases indicates wondrous awakening; here it may be the sign that the first abode can accomplish Buddhahood through eight phases, still speaking of ultimate awakening by borrowing the previous stages. The line "if in the later evil age" is the general conclusion of practice completion. The faith-root attains firm faith in the Three Jewels, which nothing can destroy; the vigor-root attains the four right efforts; the mindfulness-root attains the four mindfulness establishments; diligent skillful means tame greed and sorrow; the concentration-root attains the four dhyānas; the wisdom-root attains understanding of the Four Noble Truths, knowing them as they really are. Again, the faith-root is the pure faith-mind attained by arousing bodhi-mind toward the Tathāgata; the vigor-root is the diligence arising from the mind aroused toward the Tathāgata; the mindfulness-root is the mindfulness arising from that mind; the concentration-root is the samādhi arising from that mind; the wisdom-root is the wisdom arising from that mind. The Eightfold Right Path is the śramaṇa path and also the śramaṇa dharma; achieving the exhaustion of all afflictions of greed and anger is the meaning of śramaṇa. The four fruits are the fruits of śramaṇa. As for dreams, from srotaāpanna up to pratyekabuddhas all have dreams; only the Buddha does not dream, because there is no doubt and no habitual tendencies. There are dreams from five causes, as the verse says: because of doubt, discrimination, learning, present circumstances, and non-human communication; from these five causes come dreams. There are also dreams from what was recently heard and seen and from various illnesses, which are seven causes for dreams.**

**師嚴道尊鞠躬祇奉，如來一命四方奔踊，故言「從地踊出品」。三世化導惠利無疆，一月萬影孰能思量？召過以示現，弘經以益當，故言「從地踊出品」。虛空湛然無早無晚，或者執迹而闇其本，召昔示今破近顯遠，故言「從地踊出品」。寂場少父、寂光老兒，示其藥力咸令得知，故言「從地踊出品」。文云「是從何所來，以何因緣集」，今以諸義釋品，顯四悉檀因緣之解，故言「從地踊出品」。此下是大段，第二開師門之近迹，顯佛地之遠本。其文為三：一、從此下，至「汝等自當因是得聞」，序段也；二、從「爾時釋迦告彌勒」下，至〈分別功德品〉彌勒說十九行偈，正說段也；三、從偈後下十一品半，流通段(云云)。**

**The Master reverently serves the honored teacher; at a single command of the Tathāgata, [they] surge up from the four directions—therefore it is called the "Emerging from the Earth" Chapter. The guidance and benefit of the three times is boundless; who can fathom a single moon and ten thousand reflections? He summons the past to manifest it, and propagates the sutra to benefit the present; therefore it is called the "Emerging from the Earth" Chapter. Space is clear and still, with no early or late; some cling to traces and obscure the origin. He summons the former and shows the present, breaking the near and revealing the far; therefore it is called the "Emerging from the Earth" Chapter. At the Quiescent Site there is a young father; in Quiescent Light an old child; he reveals the power of the medicine so that all may know—therefore it is called the "Emerging from the Earth" Chapter. The text says, "From where do they come, by what causes and conditions do they gather?" Now, by various meanings we explain the chapter, manifesting the Four Siddhāntas' causal interpretation; therefore it is called the "Emerging from the Earth" Chapter. From here onward is the great section: second, opening the near traces of the master's lineage and revealing the far origin of the Buddha-ground. The text has three parts: (1) from here down to "you yourselves will thereby hear" is the preface section; (2) from "At that time Śākyamuni told Maitreya" down to the "Discrimination of Merits" chapter where Maitreya speaks nineteen lines of verse is the main exposition section; (3) from after the verse down through eleven and a half chapters is the circulation section (云云).**

**The preface has two parts: (1) the surging up, (2) the doubts. The surging up has three: (1) bodhisattvas from other lands ask to propagate the sutra; (2) the Tathāgata does not permit; (3) those from below surge up. Bodhisattvas from other lands hear that the merit of propagating the sutra is great and all wish to vow to remain here and宣弘; therefore they request it. The Tathāgata stops them for three reasons: (1) each of you has your own duty; if you remain in this land you will abandon benefit there; (2) the karmic ties between other lands and this land are shallow—though you wish to propagate, there will not be great benefit; (3) if he permits you, then he cannot summon those below; if those below do not come, the traces cannot be broken and the far cannot be revealed. These are the three reasons the Tathāgata stops them. Summoning those from below also has three meanings: they are my disciples and should propagate my Dharma; their affinities are deep and broad and can benefit this land, the lands of the emanated bodies, and other lands; moreover, it opens the near and reveals the far. Therefore he stops those above and summons those below. From "When the Buddha said this" downward is the third: those from below surge up. It has two: (1) the sutra compiler narrates the appearance, (2) clarifies the greeting. Each of the two sections has five. The first five are: (1) surging up, (2) body appearance, (3) dwelling place, (4) hearing the command, (5) retinue. The dwelling place is the Land of Constant Quiescent Light: "constant" is the virtue of permanence; "quiescent" is the virtue of bliss; "light" is the pure self. These are the secret treasury of the four virtues; it is their dwelling place. By the Dharma of non-abiding they abide in the secret treasury. "Below" means the deep bottom of Dharma-nature, the ultimate ground of the profound principle; therefore it is called "below." In the below it does not belong to this; in empty space it does not belong to that. Neither this nor that is the Middle Way. Emerging from this is neither above nor below; not above, not below, it dwells in empty space—this also is the Middle Way. The cause of their coming is: they come because they heard the command, to propagate the Dharma, to break attachments, to reveal the origin—all as stated above. Their retinues: according to ordinary expectations, leading sixty thousand or fifty thousand Ganges sands is considered many; leading three, two, or one is few; alone is solitary. But according to the text, sixty thousand or fifty thousand are few, a single person is many. The text says that those who are solitary alone have a number that surpasses the above. According to the Dharma-gate, each one has the virtue of a guide, able to lead multitudes to the treasure place. One should know: one is not solitary, sixty thousand is not many. One is one path of purity; two is concentration and wisdom; three is precepts, concentration, and wisdom; four is the Four Truths; five is the five eyes; six is the six perfections. Each perfection contains the ten Dharma Realms; each realm has ten; ten makes a hundred; a hundred contains a thousand; the ten good deeds make ten thousand. One perfection contains ten thousand; six perfections are sixty thousand Dharma gates. Many is not many; one is not few; neither many nor few, yet many and yet few (云云).**

**「是諸菩薩從地出」下，第二，問訊，為五：一、三業供養，二、陳問訊之辭，三、佛答安樂，四、偈頌隨喜，五、如來述歎。就初三業供養，經五十小劫謂如半日，四眾遍見，此乃隱長而現短，借其神力令狹而見廣，俱是不可思議也。「拜遶」是身、「讚法」是口、「瞻仰」是意；「五十小劫」與「半日」者，此是時節不可思議。如來所見不以二相，下方菩薩常面稱揚，如來默然常受其讚，解者即短而長，謂五十小劫，惑者即長而短，謂如半日，斯為本迹而作弄引。如來未說，闇本而執迹；佛若開顯，悟近而達遠，亦知不思議一也。四眾遍見菩薩者，亦是不思議也。夫肉眼、天眼所見不遠，而今所覩充滿虛空，見雨猛知龍大，見花盛知池深，見應滿虛空，則知真彌法界也。初、標四導師。**

**From "These bodhisattvas emerged from the earth" downward is the second: the greeting, in five: (1) offerings of the three karmas, (2) presenting the words of inquiry and greeting, (3) the Buddha answers with peace and joy, (4) verses of rejoicing, (5) the Tathāgata's commendation. Regarding the first, the offerings of the three karmas: fifty small kalpas are said to be like half a day; the four assemblies all see it. This is hiding the long and manifesting the short, borrowing the Buddha's spiritual power to make narrow seem broad; both are inconceivable. "Bow and circumambulate" is body; "praise the Dharma" is mouth; "gaze up" is mind. "Fifty small kalpas" and "half a day" are inconceivable in time. The Tathāgata's seeing is not in terms of two marks: the bodhisattvas below constantly praise him face-to-face, and the Tathāgata silently always receives their praise. The one who understands sees the short as long and calls it fifty small kalpas; the one confused sees the long as short and calls it half a day. This is using origin and traces as playful guidance. Before the Tathāgata speaks, one obscures the origin and clings to traces; if the Buddha opens and reveals, one awakens from the near and reaches the far, and also knows the inconceivable one. That the four assemblies see the bodhisattvas everywhere is also inconceivable. The flesh-eye and heavenly-eye do not see far, yet now what is seen fills empty space; seeing fierce rain one knows the dragon is great; seeing flowers abundant one knows the pond is deep; seeing the responses fill empty space one knows it truly pervades the Dharma realm. First, it marks the four guiding teachers.**

**次、陳問辭。問又二：長行、偈頌。長行有二：一、問如來安樂，二、問眾生易度(云云)。但舉四人者，欲擬開示悟入四十位耳，如《華嚴》但舉法慧、德林、金幢、金藏說四十位(云云)。**

**Next, presenting the words of inquiry. The inquiry again has two: prose and verses. The prose has two: (1) asking about the Tathāgata's peace and joy, (2) asking whether beings are easily度化 (云云). It only raises four persons in order to model the "opening, showing, awakening, and entering" of the forty positions; just as the *Avataṃsaka* only raises Fǎhuì, Délín, Jīnchuáng, and Jīnzàng to speak of the forty positions (云云).**

**三，如來具答。安樂、易度兩事相成，易度則安樂，安樂則易度。易度為兩：一、根利德厚，世世已來常受大化，始見我身即稟《華嚴》入如來慧，果熟易零，是眾生易度；二、根鈍德薄，世世已來不受大化，為是人故須開鈍說漸，三藏、方等、《般若》而調伏之，亦令此人今聞《法華》入於佛慧。比前雖難，於佛甚易，佛識其宜方便得所，薄須塗熨慧悟是同。今略舉十意釋之：第一、始見今見，第二、開合不開合，第三、豎廣橫略，第四、本一迹多迹共本獨，第五、加說不加說，第六、變土不變土，第七、多處不多處，第八、斥奪不斥奪，第九、直顯實開權顯實，第十、利根初熟鈍根後熟。第一始見今見者，初成道時名始見，法華座席久後真實名今見也。日照高山即說於頓，不開不合；為不入者開頓說漸，五味調伏令漸歸頓。頓直豎入入於法界故言豎廣，不歷方便故言橫略，今歷五味即是橫廣，得入佛慧亦是豎廣。一臺故本一，千葉故迹多，迹與眾經同故言共，本與眾經異故言獨。加四菩薩說四十位，自說開示悟入不加於他。花王世界故言不變，二變土田故言變土。七處八會是為多處，耆闍崛山遠處虛空故不多處。滅化城改客作故言斥奪，無如此事故不斥奪。行大直道名直顯實，決了聲聞法，名開權顯實。根利緣熟始入佛慧，根鈍後熟今入佛慧。緣宜不同略為十異，種智法界等無差別，故文云「始見我身聞我所說，即皆信受入如來慧，除先修習學小乘者。」今於此經入於佛慧，明文在茲不須疑也。諸師見其緣異，逐緣異解迷不知反去道轉遠，若識理同千車共轍，佛慧則無殊也。舊云，《華嚴》了義滿字常住，《法華》不了義非滿非常，今以此文並之，若始入是了義，今入不了義者，始入是佛慧，今入非佛慧，若佛慧既齊了義亦等，滿字常住悉然(云云)。地人呼《華嚴》為圓宗，《法華》為不真宗，今亦用此文並之。**

**Third, the Tathāgata answers fully. The two matters of peace and joy and ease of度 are mutually completing: if it is easy to度, there is peace and joy; if there is peace and joy, it is easy to度. Ease of度 has two: (1) those of sharp roots and deep virtue, who in life after life have always received great transformation; upon first seeing my body they immediately receive the *Avataṃsaka* and enter the Tathāgata's wisdom. Their fruit is ripe and easily falls; these beings are easy to度. (2) Those of dull roots and thin virtue, who in life after life have not received great transformation; for these people one must open dullness and speak gradually, using Tripiṭaka, Vaipulya, and *Prajñā* to tame them, also causing these people now, upon hearing the *Lotus*, to enter the Buddha's wisdom. Compared with the former, though difficult, for the Buddha it is very easy: the Buddha knows what is appropriate and skillfully finds the proper means; the thin and thick must be smoothed, but the wisdom-awakening is the same. Now he briefly raises ten meanings to explain: (1) first-seeing and now-seeing, (2) opening-and-closing vs. not opening-and-closing, (3) vertical-broad vs. horizontal-concise, (4) origin one, traces many, traces shared, origin unique, (5) added preaching vs. not added preaching, (6) transformed land vs. untransformed land, (7) many places vs. not many places, (8) reprimanding and depriving vs. not reprimanding and depriving, (9) directly revealing the real and opening the provisional to reveal the real, (10) sharp roots maturing early, dull roots maturing later. First, first-seeing and now-seeing: at the time of initial enlightenment it is called first-seeing; the true long-later of the Lotus assembly is called now-seeing. When the sun illuminates the high mountains, he immediately speaks the sudden, without opening or closing. For those who do not enter, he opens the sudden and speaks the gradual, using the five flavors to tame them, causing them gradually to return to the sudden. The sudden directly enters vertically into the Dharma realm, therefore it is called vertical-broad; not passing through expedients is called horizontal-concise. Now, passing through the five flavors is horizontal-broad; attaining entry to the Buddha's wisdom is also vertical-broad. One platform means the origin is one; a thousand petals means the traces are many. The traces are the same as other sutras, therefore called shared; the origin is different from other sutras, therefore called unique. Adding four bodhisattvas to speak the forty positions is added preaching; the Buddha's own speaking of opening, showing, awakening, and entering is not added. The Flower-King world is therefore "untransformed"; two transformed lands are called transformed lands. Seven places and eight assemblies are many places; Vulture Peak in the far empty space is not many places. Destroying the magic city and changing the hired son is reprimanding and depriving; without such events is not reprimanding and depriving. Practicing the great straight path is called directly revealing the real; deciding the śrāvaka dharma is called opening the provisional to reveal the real. Sharp roots mature earlier and first enter Buddha wisdom; dull roots mature later and now enter Buddha wisdom. Since affinities and appropriateness differ, it is briefly called ten differences. Yet the dharma realm of all-seed wisdom is equal and without difference; therefore the text says, "When they first see my body and hear what I preach, they all believe and accept and enter the Tathāgata's wisdom, except those who previously practiced and studied the Small Vehicle." Now, in this sutra they enter the Buddha's wisdom; the clear text is here, so there is no need to doubt. Various teachers, seeing differences in conditions, follow those differences in interpretation and, confused, do not know that they are turning away from the path and going farther; if one knows that the principle is the same, like a thousand carts sharing the same ruts, then the Buddha's wisdom has no difference. The old saying is: the *Avataṃsaka* is definitive meaning, full word, permanent; the *Lotus* is not definitive, not full, not permanent. Now, by this passage we compare them: if first entry is definitive, and now entry is not definitive, then first entry is Buddha wisdom and now entry is not Buddha wisdom. If Buddha wisdom is already equal, definitive meaning is also equal; full word and permanence are all thus (云云). People of the land call the *Avataṃsaka* the Perfect School and the *Lotus* the Not-True School; now we also use this passage to compare them.**

**第四，菩薩領解隨喜。能問者，即是《華嚴》中四大士，《法華》中身子三請，俱是能問也。所問者，即是問佛智慧也。**

**Fourth: the bodhisattvas understand and rejoice. Those who can ask are precisely the four great bodhisattvas in the *Avataṃsaka* and, in the *Lotus*, Śāriputra's three requests—these are the ones who can ask. What is asked is precisely the Buddha's wisdom.**

---

**第五，如來述歎者，與問碩異，問家隨喜。能問人皆是菩薩，及所化人聞已信行，我等隨喜。如來述歎能化人生隨喜者，此義云何？然能問者皆是古佛，汝能隨喜即是如來，菩薩隨喜其迹，如來述歎其本，此亦密表壽量(云云)。「爾時彌勒及八萬大士」下，第二，疑問序。自寂場已降，今座已往，十方大士來會不絕，雖不可限，我以補處智力悉見悉知，而於此眾不識一人，然我遊化十方覲奉諸佛，諸佛大眾快所諳知，就履歷之處亦所不識，若來若去如是推之皆所不識。又彼諸大士是前進先達，彌勒是後番末學，後不知前故所不識。又彼等大士，本實相底應現十方，別頭教化所有真應，非彌勒境界，是故不識。又佛託弘經召諸大士，大士聞師命故來，密聞壽量，非時眾所知，故言不識。此約四悉檀，釋疑問序也(云云)。疑問為二：一、此土菩薩疑，二、他土菩薩疑。此土疑又二：初、長行，疑念；次、偈，十九行半偈，正問，又為五：初一行一句，問何處來；次「何因緣」下，第二，一行三句，問何因緣來；次「一一諸菩薩」下，第三，九行，敘其數量；次「是諸大威德」下，第四，兩行，問其師誰；次「如是菩薩神通」下，第五，五行半，結請，又五：初兩句，結歎；次「四方地」下，第二，兩行，請答來處；次「我於此眾」下，第三，一行，請答來緣；次「今此之大眾」下，第四，一行半，大會同請；次「無量德」下，第五，二句，請答師主(云云)。**

**Fifth: the Tathāgata's narration and praise are different from the questioners; the questioners rejoice. Those who can ask are all bodhisattvas, and the transformed people, upon hearing, believe and practice; we all rejoice. The Tathāgata narrates and praises the rejoicing of the transforming and transformed—what does this mean? The ones who can ask are all ancient Buddhas; you who can rejoice are the Tathāgata. Bodhisattvas rejoice in their traces; the Tathāgata narrates and praises their origin—this also subtly indicates the Life-Span (云云). From "At that time Maitreya and the eighty thousand great ones" downward is the second: the preface of doubts. From the Quiescent Site onward, and now in the present assembly, great bodhisattvas from the ten directions come without ceasing; though limitless, I (with the wisdom of one in the successor position) see and know them all, yet in this assembly I do not recognize a single one. I have traveled and transformed the ten directions, served the Buddhas; among the Buddhas' assemblies there are many whom I know, yet in the places I have traversed I recognize none of these; whether they come or go, by such inference I do not recognize them. Moreover, those great bodhisattvas are the earlier, more advanced ones; Maitreya is a later, junior learner; the later does not know the former, therefore he does not recognize them. Moreover, those great bodhisattvas are manifestations from the base of real-mark; they appear throughout the ten directions, separately teaching and transforming true responses; this is not within Maitreya's境界, therefore he does not recognize them. Moreover, the Buddha entrusts propagation and summons these great bodhisattvas; they come hearing the master's command, secretly hearing the life-span; it is not known to the present assembly, therefore it says he does not recognize them. This, according to the Four Siddhāntas, explains the preface of doubts (云云). The doubts are in two: (1) doubts of the bodhisattvas of this land, (2) doubts of the bodhisattvas of other lands. The doubts of this land are again two: first, prose, the doubt-thought; second, verses, nineteen and a half lines of verse, the direct question, again in five parts: first, one line and one phrase asking where they came from; next, from "by what causes and conditions" downward, second, one line and three phrases asking by what causes and conditions they came; next, from "each bodhisattva" downward, third, nine lines describing their number; next, from "these great powerful virtues" downward, fourth, two lines asking who their teacher is; next, from "such bodhisattvas' supernatural powers" downward, fifth, five and a half lines concluding the request, again in five: first two phrases, concluding praise; next, from "the four directions' earth" downward, second, two lines requesting the place of their coming; next, from "among this assembly" downward, third, one line requesting the cause of their coming; next, from "now this great assembly" downward, fourth, one and a half lines, the great assembly's共同 request; next, from "immeasurable virtues" downward, fifth, two phrases requesting the teacher-master (云云).**

**二、他方菩薩疑者，分身眷屬橫在十方，與彌勒同疑，二土俱不知本地，欲顯成道甚久，各各陳疑已佛，佛皆抑待彌勒(云云)。**

**Second, the doubts of bodhisattvas from other lands: the retinues of the emanated bodies spread across the ten directions and share Maitreya's doubt. Both lands do not know the original ground; wishing to reveal that enlightenment was long ago, each presents doubt to the Buddha, and the Buddha restrains them, waiting for Maitreya (云云).**

**From "At that time Śākyamuni Buddha told Maitreya" downward is the second: the main exposition. The text has two: first the prose, then verse-admonition and permission, then the main exposition. The prose first narrates praise; next admonishes—admonishing not to be disorderly, not lazy, not retreat; next permits and marks the fruit-wisdom: the fruit-wisdom is the Tathāgata's knowledge and vision, the wondrous fruit of knowledge and vision. Next, opening the transformative teaching is "to proclaim and show." "Sovereign spiritual power" refers to benefiting beings in the past; "lion's奋迅" refers to places covered by the present emanated bodies in the ten directions. Some say the奋迅 carries forward the prior state; this indicates the sign of future constant-abiding benefit to beings. "Great power and mighty strength" refers to benefiting beings in the future. Some take this as present震動 of the ten directions, used according to people's intentions. It is best to follow the sequence of the text. Also, privately: "Tathāgata's sovereignty" is myself; "supernatural power" is bliss; "lion's奋迅" is swift removal of defilements and purity; "great power and mighty strength" is future benefit to beings, that is, permanence. This points to the meaning of the four virtues (云云). The four-line verse: the first three phrases praise the three admonitions; the last three lines and one phrase praise the permission. The first line praises the marked wisdom-fruit; the next three lines praise the three times.**

**From "At that time the World Honored One" downward is the second: the main exposition section. The text has three: from here through the end of the "Life-Span" chapter, it directly opens the near and reveals the far; second, the beginning of the "Discrimination" chapter, generally conferring the Dharma-body prediction; third, Maitreya's general statement of understanding. The first has two: first, a brief opening of the near and revealing the far that moves attachment and gives rise to doubt; second, a broad opening of the near and revealing the far that cuts delusion and gives rise to faith. The brief has two: (1) brief opening, (2) because of doubt, further request. In the brief opening there are prose and verse; here it only answers two questions and does not answer "by what causes and conditions they gathered." Because it does not answer, there is further request. The prose answers both questions and explains both, as in the text. Explaining "dwelling in the air below": the *Treatise* clarifies a samādhi with a "bottom"; it should be explained in four ways: "existence" means the three existences; "bottom" means neither-perception-nor-nonperception, and because it is deep and supreme it is called bottom. Again, "existence" means names and marks; "bottom" means emptiness, and because emptiness is quiescent it is called bottom. Again, "existence" means the two extremes of the conventional; "bottom" means boundary wisdom is full, therefore it is called bottom. Now the sutra takes the air below as the bottom—not the upper realm, not the lower realm—indicating the Middle Way as the bottom; this is differentiated in terms of teaching (云云). From "among the sutras" downward is the explanation: the Master knows that the disciples have complete two virtues, wisdom and cutting; first, they cultivate wisdom and cutting together; next, they證 wisdom and cutting together. Discerning in the sutras is cultivation of wisdom; correctly remembering is cultivation of cutting; not delighting to be in the assembly is certification of cutting; diligent practice of effort is certification of wisdom. From "not relying on humans and gods and abiding" is explanation of the place: humans and gods are the two extremes; not abiding, not attaching. "Deep wisdom unobstructed" means relying on inconceivable wisdom. "Delighting in the Buddha-Dharma" means delighting in the inconceivable境. The境 and wisdom are extremely subtle; it is not the bodhisattva who practices near.**

**From "At that time Maitreya" downward, because of doubt he again requests. There are prose and verses. The prose has two: (1) doubt, (2) request. Hearing above "Under the bodhi tree he taught them and now they all dwell in non-retreat," and also hearing "From long ago I have taught these assemblies," hearing these two statements stirs attachment and gives rise to doubt. From "he addressed the Buddha" downward, raising doubts and again requesting, also in two: dharma and parable. The dharma explanation is three: first, from "he immediately said to the Buddha" downward—doubting that enlightenment was near and that those transformed were many, clinging to the near and doubting the far; next, from "World Honored One, these great bodhisattvas" downward—since the transformed are many and their stages are deep and subtle, he clings to the far and doubts the near; next, from "World Honored One, such a matter" downward—the concluding request. The parable has opening and closing. The opening has three: "beautiful complexion and black hair" is a metaphor for the previous meaning of near enlightenment; "pointing to a hundred-year-old man" and onward is a metaphor for the previous meaning that those transformed are many. The Huai-bei masters interpret the parable by a parable: a father takes a medicine that returns his years, and his appearance is like twenty-five; the son does not take the medicine and looks like a hundred. If one knows the power of the medicine, one does not doubt father and son; if one does not know, one is astonished. The Tathāgata horizontally takes the medicine of manifesting traces, showing that in Gayā he was first born; the bodhisattvas directly discuss the origin-ground, having long aroused the mind and now dwelling in non-retreat. If Buddhas know this quickly, those below who do not reach it cannot but doubt. From "this matter is hard to believe" downward is the conclusion of the parable. First, it matches the near-parable, as in the text; from "and this great assembly" downward, it matches the far-parable. Seeing that these bodhisattvas long planted good roots, it is not only at Gayā they aroused the mind. "Good entering, good exiting, good abiding": the nine successive concentrations are good entering; the lion's奋迅 is good exiting; surpassing is good abiding—this is the Shared and Tripiṭaka meaning. From the first ground to the tenth ground is called good entering; the tenth ground entering the profound mystery gate, reversing and cultivating ordinary people's affairs is called good exiting; wondrous awakening pervading fulfillment is called good abiding—this is the Distinct meaning. The completion of the dharma-nature samādhi is good entering; the Śūraṅgama is good exiting; the King Samādhi is good abiding—this is the Perfect meaning. Sequentially cultivating all good dharmas is called good practice in terms of cause; in terms of fruit it is called good entering (云云). "Good at answering difficult questions" means possessing the two adornments. The尊 of the seven expedients is therefore called "treasure." From "today, World Honored One" downward is the request for an answer, again in three: from "today" downward, stating the Buddha's words; from "we" downward, second, clarifying the intent of the request. The intent has two: (1) for the present. Though I have not attained understanding, I only believe. (2) From "but the bodhisattvas" downward, for the future: those of shallow practice may give rise to slander; those newly arousing aspiration may slander and fall into the evil paths; those in non-retreat, though they believe and do not slander, cannot increase the path. If one differentiates, those who slander will give rise to faith, and those who have faith will increase the path (云云). From "only so" downward, third, the request for an answer. The request is also two: first, "remove our doubts"; second, from "and the future" downward, remove future doubts.**

**先出異解。叡師〈序〉云「壽無量劫未足以明其久，分身無數不足以異其體，然則壽量定其非數，分身明其不異，普賢顯其無成，多寶明其不滅耳。」河西道朗云：「明法身真化不異、存沒理一，多寶現明法身常存，壽量明與太虛齊量。」道場觀云：「會三歸一，乘之始也；滅影澄神，乘之終也。滅影謂息迹，澄神則明本，故迹無常而本常也。」注者云「非存亡之數曰壽，出修夭之限稱量，法身非形年所攝，使大士修踐極之照，不以伽耶為成佛、百年為期頤也。」竺道生云：「其色身佛者，應現而有，無有實形，既形不實豈有壽哉？然則萬形同致、古今為一，古亦今也今亦古也，無時不有、無處不在，若有時不有、有處不在者，於眾生然耳，佛不爾也，是以極譚長壽，云伽耶是也。伽耶是者非復伽耶，伽耶既非，彼長何獨是乎？長短斯亡，長短恒存焉。」前代匠者如向所說，多約無量明常，近世人師多云壽是量法，前過恒沙、後倍上數，終歸限極而明無常。又惑者執品明壽量，量是無常那作常解？今為答之，品直道壽量，不道壽有量、不道壽無量，爾作無常、他作常解，此復何咎？鷸蚌相扼，我乘其弊，應具四解：謂實有量而言無量，《彌陀》是也；實無量而言量，如此品及《金光明》是也，實無量而言無量，如《涅槃》云「唯佛與佛其壽無量」是也；實有量而言量，如八十唱滅是也。品文具有此義，豈可是一而非三耶？**

**First, present divergent interpretations. Master Rui in the "Preface" says: "A life-span of immeasurable kalpas is still not enough to clarify its length; countless emanated bodies are still not enough to make their substance different. Thus, the life-span clarifies that it is not a number; the emanated bodies clarify that they are not different. Samantabhadra reveals that it is not produced; Prabhūtaratna reveals that it is not extinguished." Dao Lang of Hexi says: "It clarifies that the Dharma-body and true transformation are not different, that presence and absence are one in principle. Prabhūtaratna's manifestation clarifies that the Dharma-body eternally abides; the Life-Span clarifies that it is equal in measure to the Great Void." Daochang Guan says: "The Three are unified into One—this is the beginning of the vehicle; the shadow is extinguished and the spirit clarified—this is the end of the vehicle. Extinguishing the shadow means ceasing the trace; clarifying the spirit means making the origin clear; therefore the trace is impermanent while the origin is permanent." The annotator says: "Life-span is not the number of presence or absence; it transcends the limits of longevity and shortness to be called a measure. The Dharma-body is not captured by form and years; it causes great bodhisattvas to cultivate the ultimate illumination, not taking Gayā as the site of Buddhahood nor a hundred years as the period of longevity." Zhu Daosheng says: "The Buddha of the form-body exists by responsive manifestation; there is no real form. Since the form is not real, how can there be a life-span? Thus, the myriad forms all arrive at the same; past and present are one; the past is also the present and the present also the past. There is no time when it does not exist, no place where it is not present. If there were a time when it did not exist, or a place where it is not present, that would be only for sentient beings; the Buddha is not thus. Therefore he speaks to the utmost of long life, saying it is at Gayā. Yet if Gayā is that, it is no longer Gayā; once Gayā is not, how can that long life be only there? Long and short are thus negated, and yet long and short ever abide." The sages of earlier generations, as said above, mostly used the immeasurable to clarify permanence; recent teachers mostly say life-span is a measured dharma, that it passes over Ganges sands in the past and doubles the numbers ahead, finally returning to a limit and clarifying impermanence. Again, the deluded cling to the chapter's clarity of life-span, saying that measure is impermanent—how can it be explained as permanent? Now, in response, the chapter directly speaks of life-span, not saying the life-span has measure, nor saying the life-span is immeasurable. You interpret impermanence, others interpret permanence—what fault is this? The sandpiper and the clam cling to each other; I ride their weakness and should provide four explanations: (1) truly has measure and yet speaks of immeasurable—this is *Amitābha*; (2) truly immeasurable and yet speaks of measure—this chapter and the *Golden Light*; (3) truly immeasurable and yet speaks of immeasurable—this is the *Nirvāṇa* saying, "Only Buddha with Buddha, their life-span is immeasurable"; (4) truly has measure and yet speaks of measure—this is the eighty-year proclamation of extinction. The chapter's text includes these meanings; how can one take one and reject the other three?**

**今反質之，《法華》一乘與《勝鬘》一乘何異(云云)？若分別答者，《法華》略明常，《涅槃》廣明常，《勝鬘》為一明一，《法華》會三明一(云云)。**

**Now, in reply: how is the One Vehicle of the *Lotus* different from the One Vehicle of the *Śrīmālā* (云云)? If one answers by distinguishing, the *Lotus* briefly clarifies permanence; the *Nirvāṇa* broadly clarifies permanence; the *Śrīmālā* clarifies One to reveal One; the *Lotus* unites three to clarify One (云云).**

---

**問：近成是方便，遠成是真實者，《華嚴》寂滅道場、《大經》超前九劫，皆成方便；若爾，《法華》開遠竟，常不輕那更近？當知《法華》已復方便。若爾，會三歸一竟，亦應不會三歸一。若爾，開三顯一諸佛道同，開近顯遠亦諸佛道同。若爾，諸佛皆爾，非獨釋迦；若獨釋迦，前諸義壞。**

**Question: If near attainment is expedient and far attainment is real, then the *Avataṃsaka*'s quiescent道場 and the *Mahāparinirvāṇa*'s "surpassing nine kalpas before" are all expedients. If so, once the *Lotus* opens the far, would "Never-Despising" be even nearer? One should know the *Lotus* then becomes expedient again. If so, once the three are united into one, it should also be not uniting three into one. If so, opening three and revealing one means the Buddhas' paths are the same; opening the near and revealing the far also means the Buddhas' paths are the same. If so, all Buddhas are so, not only Śākyamuni; if only Śākyamuni, then the previous meanings are destroyed.**

---

**答云：是我方便諸佛亦然，又諸菩薩聞〈壽量〉發願，願我於未來說壽亦如是。此即諸佛道同，亦不偏言一近一遠，故知寄無始無終、無近無遠，顯法身常住；有始有終、有近有遠，論其應迹。用此義望諸經，對緣雖異，終不異也。既了眾經，諸師不可師也。**

**Answer: This is my expedient; all Buddhas are likewise. Moreover, bodhisattvas, hearing the "Life-Span," vow that I in the future will also preach life-span in the same way. This is that the Buddhas' paths are the same; it also does not偏ly speak of one near and one far. Therefore know that by provisionally positing beginningless and endless, near and far are absent, to manifest the Dharma-body's constant abiding; when there is beginning and end, near and far, one is speaking of responsive traces. Using this meaning to view the sutras, though the conditions differ, in the end they do not differ. Having understood all sutras, the various teachers are not to be teachers.**

---

**問：義推常可，然徵文何據？**

**Question: One can infer permanence by meaning; but what textual basis is there?**

---

**答：明者貴其理，暗者守其文，但尋詮會宗，是教之正意，苟執糟糠，問橋何益？又教本為緣，緣異說異，或隨欣隨宜隨治隨悟，悟則達到已矣，那更盤桓阡陌何為？故云泥洹真法寶，眾生種種門入，此之謂也。又文有多少，《涅槃》以未來常住為宗，其文則多，不以過去久成為宗，其文則少，若隨多棄少，則是魔說非佛說也。此經以過去久成為宗，點塵數界其文則多，未來常住其文則少，若從多棄少，頭破作七分，如阿梨樹枝。譬天子勅，若多若少俱不可違，違之得罪。〈方便品〉云「世間相常住，於道場知已，導師方便說」，此文即未來常住不滅；又云「我常住於此」；又云「常在靈鷲山，及餘諸住處」；《普賢觀》云「常波羅蜜所攝成處，我波羅蜜所安立處」，如此常文亦復不少。又此經處處明法身，法身豈不常耶。**

**Answer: Those who understand value the principle; those who are dark cling to the text. One should only seek the terms and meet the main meaning—that is the correct intent of the teaching. If one clings to chaff and husks, what benefit is there in asking about the bridge? Moreover, the teaching is originally for conditions; when conditions differ, the teachings differ. Sometimes it follows joy, sometimes suitability, sometimes remedy, sometimes awakening. When one awakens, one has already arrived—why linger in lanes and byways? Therefore it is said, "Nirvāṇa is the true Dharma-treasure; beings enter by various gates"—this is its meaning. Again, the text has more and less: the *Nirvāṇa* takes future constant abiding as its宗, so its text is much; it does not take past long-ago accomplishment as its宗, so its text is little. If one follows the much and discards the little, that is Māra's speech, not the Buddha's. This sutra takes past long-ago accomplishment as its宗; the dust-mote-numbered worlds have much text; future constant abiding has little text. If one follows the much and discards the little, one's head is split into seven parts like the branches of the āḷi tree. It is like a crown prince's decree: whether much or little, both must not be violated; violation incurs罪. The "Expedient Means" chapter says, "The marks of the world are constantly abiding; having known [this] at the道場, the guide speaks expedients"—this text is future constant abiding without extinction. It also says, "I constantly abide here"; also, "always on Vulture Peak and other dwelling places"; the *Samantabhadra Contemplation* says, "the place accomplished by being embraced by the constant pāramitā, the place established by my pāramitā." Thus, these constant texts are not few. Moreover, throughout this sutra the Dharma-body is clarified; how could the Dharma-body not be permanent?**

**釋品，「如來」者，十方三世諸佛二佛三佛本佛迹佛之通號也。「壽量」者，詮量也，詮量十方三世二佛三佛本佛迹佛之功德也。今正詮量本地三佛功德，故言「如來壽量品」。如來義甚多，且明二三如來，餘例可解。二如來者，《成論》云「乘如實道來成正覺故名如來」。乘是法如如智，實是法如如境，道是因、覺是果。若單論乘者，如如無所知；單明實者，如如無能知。境智和合則有因果，照境未窮名因，盡源為果，道覺義成，即是乘如實道來成正覺，此真身如來也。以如實智，乘如實道，來生三有示成正覺者，即應身如來也。三如來者，《大論》云「如法相解、如法相說，故名如來」。如者法如如境，非因非果，有佛無佛性相常然，遍一切處而無有異為如，不動而至為來，指此為法身如來也。法如如智，乘於如如真實之道來成妙覺，智稱如理，從理名如、從智名來，即報身如來。故《論》云「如法相解故名如來」也。以如如境智合故，即能處處示成正覺。水銀和真金，能塗諸色像，功德和法身，處處應現往，八相成道轉妙法輪，即應身如來。故《論》云「如法相說故名如來」也。法身如來名毘盧遮那，此翻遍一切處；報身如來名盧舍那，此翻淨滿；應身如來名釋迦文，此翻度沃焦。是三如來若單取者則不可也，《大經》云「法身亦非、般若亦非、解脫亦非，三法具足稱祕密藏、名大涅槃」，不可一異縱橫並別，圓覽三法稱假名如來也。《梵網經》結成華嚴教，華臺為本、華葉為末，別為一緣作如此說，而本末不得相離。《像法決疑經》結成涅槃，文云「或見釋迦為毘盧遮那，或為盧舍那」，蓋前緣異見，非佛三也。《普賢觀》結成法華，文云「釋迦牟尼名毘盧遮那」，乃是異名非別體也。總眾經之意，當知三佛非一異明矣。**

**Explaining the chapter: "Tathāgata" is the common designation for all Buddhas of the ten directions and three times—two Buddhas, three Buddhas, origin-Buddha and trace-Buddha. "Life-span" is the measuring and explicating; it explicates and measures the merits of all Buddhas of the ten directions and three times, whether two or three Buddhas, origin or trace. Now it directly explicates and measures the merits of the three Buddhas of the origin-ground; therefore it is called the "Life-Span of the Tathāgata" chapter. The meaning of Tathāgata is many; for now, clarify the two and three Tathāgatas; the rest can be understood by analogy. The two Tathāgatas: the *Cheng Lun* says, "Riding the thus-real path and coming to accomplish correct awakening, therefore named Tathāgata." The riding is the thus-real wisdom of the Dharma; the real is the thus-real object; the path is the cause, awakening is the fruit. If one speaks only of the riding, thusness has nothing it knows; if one speaks only of the real, thusness has nothing that knows. When object and wisdom harmonize, there are cause and fruit: illuminating the object without exhausting it is called cause; exhausting the source is called fruit. When the meanings of path and awakening are complete, this is riding the thus-real path and coming to accomplish correct awakening—this is the true-body Tathāgata. By the thus-real wisdom, riding the thus-real path, coming to be born in the three existences and showing the accomplishment of correct awakening—this is the response-body Tathāgata. The three Tathāgatas: the *Great Treatise* says, "Explaining in accord with the Dharma-mark and teaching in accord with the Dharma-mark, therefore called Tathāgata." "Thus" is the Dharma's thus-real object, neither cause nor fruit; whether Buddha or not, its nature-mark is ever thus, pervading all places with no difference—this is "thus"; unmoving yet arriving is "coming." This indicates the Dharma-body Tathāgata. The thus-real wisdom of Dharma, riding the thus-real true path to accomplish wondrous awakening—wisdom accords with principle. From principle it is called "thus"; from wisdom it is called "coming"—this is the reward-body Tathāgata. Therefore the Treatise says, "Because he understands in accord with the Dharma-mark, he is called Tathāgata." Because the thus-real object and wisdom unite, he can everywhere show the accomplishment of correct awakening. Mercury mixed with pure gold can coat all colored images; merit mixed with the Dharma-body responds everywhere and appears; the eight phases of accomplishing the Way and turning the wondrous Dharma wheel is the response-body Tathāgata. Therefore the Treatise says, "Because he speaks in accord with the Dharma-mark, he is called Tathāgata." The Dharma-body Tathāgata is named Vairocana, translated "Pervading All Places"; the reward-body Tathāgata is named Rocana, translated "Pure and Full"; the response-body Tathāgata is named Śākyamuni, translated "Able to Overcome Burning". These three Tathāgatas cannot be taken separately. The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says, "The Dharma-body is not, the Prajñā is not, the Liberation is not; when the three dharmas are complete, it is called the Secret Treasury, named Great Nirvāṇa." One cannot treat them as one or different, vertical or horizontal, combined or separate; fully viewing the three dharmas, one calls the provisional name "Tathāgata." The *Brahmajāla Sūtra* concludes the Avataṃsaka teaching: the flower platform is root, the flower leaves are branch; it speaks thus for a particular condition, yet root and branch cannot be separated. The *Image-Dharma Resolving Doubts Sūtra* concludes the Nirvāṇa, saying, "Some see Śākyamuni as Vairocana, some as Rocana"—this is because previous conditions produce different views; it is not that there are three Buddhas. The *Samantabhadra Contemplation* concludes the *Lotus*, saying, "Śākyamuni is named Vairocana"—this is a different name, not a different body. The overall intention of the sutras: one should know that the three Buddhas are not explained as one or different.**

**問：此品無三佛名，那作此釋？**

**Question: This chapter does not name the three Buddhas; why make this explanation?**

---

**答：雖不標名而具其義。文云「非如非異，非如三界見於三界」，此非偏如顯於圓如，即法身如來義也；又云「如來如實知見三界之相」，即是如如智稱如如境，一切種智知見即佛眼，此是報身如來義也；又云「或示己身己事，或示他身他事」，此即應身如來義也。若但性德三如來者是橫，但修德三如來者是縱，先法次報後應亦是縱；今經圓說不縱不橫三如來也，揀縱橫如來尚非今義，況三藏通教如來耶？又《法華》之前，亦明圓如來者，同是迹中所說耳。發迹顯本三如來者，永異諸經。論云「示現成大菩提無上故，示三種菩提，一、應化菩提，隨所應現即為示現，如經出釋氏宮故；二、報佛菩提，十地滿足得常涅槃，如經我實成佛已來無量無邊劫故，三、法佛菩提，謂如來藏性淨涅槃不變，如經如來如實知見三界之相故。」經具其義、論出其名，不作上釋寧會經論耶？**

**Answer: Though it does not mark the names, it contains the meaning. The text says, "neither thus nor different, not as the three realms see the three realms"—this is not a partial thusness but reveals the perfect thusness, which is the meaning of the Dharma-body Tathāgata. It also says, "the Tathāgata truly knows and sees the marks of the three realms"—this is the thus-real wisdom corresponding to the thus-real object; all-seed wisdom and knowledge and vision are the Buddha-eye; this is the meaning of the reward-body Tathāgata. It also says, "sometimes he shows his own body and his own affairs; sometimes he shows another's body and another's affairs"—this is the meaning of the response-body Tathāgata. If one speaks only of the three Tathāgatas of intrinsic virtue, that is horizontal; only the three Tathāgatas of cultivated virtue is vertical; first Dharma, then reward, then response is also vertical. Now this sutra speaks in the perfect way of the three Tathāgatas neither vertical nor horizontal. Selecting vertical or horizontal Tathāgatas is not the meaning here; how much less the Tathāgata of the Tripiṭaka and Shared teachings? Moreover, before the *Lotus*, it also clarifies the perfect Tathāgata—this is still spoken within the traces. The three Tathāgatas that reveal traces and manifest origin are forever different from other sutras. The Treatise says: "To manifest and accomplish unsurpassed great bodhi, it reveals three kinds of bodhi: (1) response-transformation bodhi: according to what should be manifested it is manifested, as in the sutra where he leaves the Śākya palace; (2) reward-Buddha bodhi: when the ten grounds are complete, one attains constant nirvāṇa, as in the sutra where it says, 'I have truly become Buddha since immeasurable boundless kalpas'; (3) Dharma-Buddha bodhi: the Tathāgata-garbha's nature is pure nirvāṇa, unchanging, as in the sutra where it says, 'the Tathāgata truly knows and sees the marks of the three realms.'" The sutra contains the meaning and the Treatise provides the names; if we do not explain it thus, how could we harmonize sutra and treatise?**

**次明「壽量」者，「壽」者受義，真如不隔諸法故名為受，又境智相應故名受，又一期報得百年不斷故名受。「量」者詮量也，量字則通無的別據，詮量法如來以如理為命、報如來以智慧為命、應如來同緣理為命，詮量諸命若有量、若無量、若非量非無量。法身如來如理命者，有佛無佛性相常然，不論相應與不相續，亦無有量及無量。文云「非如非異非虛非實」，蓋是詮量法身如理命也。詮量報身如來，以如如智契如如境，境發智為報，智冥境為受，境既無量無邊常住不滅，智亦如是，函大蓋大。文云「我智力如是，久修業所得，慧光照無量，壽命無數劫」，此是詮量報身如來智慧命也。詮量應身者，應身同緣，緣長同長、緣促同促(云云)，自彼於我何為？文云「數數現生、數數現滅」，或復自說名字不同年紀大小，此是詮量應佛同緣命也。**

**Next, clarify "life-span": "life" means receiving. True suchness does not separate from all dharmas, therefore it is called receiving; object and wisdom correspond, therefore it is called receiving; and a single period of retribution that attains a hundred years without interruption is also called receiving. "Measure" means to explicate and measure; the word "measure" broadly has no fixed particular basis. It explicates and measures the Dharma Tathāgata who takes thus-principle as life, the reward Tathāgata who takes wisdom as life, and the response Tathāgata who takes shared conditions and principle as life; it explicates and measures these lives as having measure, having no measure, or neither measure nor no measure. The Dharma-body Tathāgata's thus-principle life: whether Buddhas arise or not, the nature and marks are ever thus; it does not discuss correspondence or discontinuity, and there is neither measure nor no-measure. The text says, "neither thus nor different, neither empty nor real"—this is explicating the Dharma-body's thus-principle life. The reward-body Tathāgata: the thus-real wisdom accords with the thus-real object; the object gives rise to wisdom as the reward; wisdom merges with the object as receiving. Since the object is boundless and immeasurable, constantly abiding and not extinguished, wisdom is likewise, embracing the great and covering the great. The text says, "My wisdom power is thus, obtained through long cultivation of karma; the light of wisdom illuminates the immeasurable, life-span is countless kalpas"—this explicates the reward-body Tathāgata's wisdom-life. The response-body: the response-body accords with conditions; long conditions yield long, short conditions yield short (云云). Why compare them to me? The text says, "repeatedly manifesting birth, repeatedly manifesting extinction"; it also speaks of different names and different sizes of years—this explicates the response-Buddha's life according to shared conditions.**

**復次，法身非量非無量，報身金剛前有量、金剛後無量，應身隨緣則有量、應用不斷則無量。通途詮量三句在聖、一句屬凡，有量無常都非佛義。舊來所說乃是增減兩謗加誣於佛，非魔是何？四句詮量其義已顯，為未解者，更常等四句料簡：先別作、次通作。別者，非常非無常，雙非理極即法身也；常者即報身也，報智境合亦非常非無常，但取正智圓滿不生不滅，過金剛心之前故，取常為報身耳；亦常亦無常應身也，應用無盡為亦常，數唱涅槃名亦無常，無常者，金剛心已前智用增進，乃至凡夫生滅出沒皆是無常。三佛各一句，凡夫共一句，此約別教別分別也。通途圓說者，一一如來悉備四句。法身四者：非常非無常，雙破凡聖八倒故；常者如虛空常故；無常者無凡夫生滅倒故；亦常亦無常者，寂而雙照故。報身四者：非常非無常者，智冥境故，常者出過二乘故：無常者無生滅倒故：亦常亦無常能雙照故。應身四者：非常非無常者，非報非生死故；常者常應同故；無常者同無常故；亦常亦無常者，兩存故。凡夫既得無常一句，通途亦作四句，但有性德之理，尚無四句名字，況行用耶？可以意得不俟說也。**

**Furthermore, the Dharma-body is neither measure nor no-measure; the reward-body has measure before the vajra [mind] and no-measure after the vajra; the response-body, following conditions, has measure, and since its responsive functioning does not cease, it has no-measure. In general, three sentences of measuring belong to sages and one sentence belongs to凡; "having measure" and "impermanent" are both not Buddha meanings. What has been said in former times is slander against the Buddha by the two extremes of increase and decrease—if this is not Mara, what is it? The four-sentence measuring already makes its meaning clear; for those who have not understood, one further analyses with the four sentences of constancy and the like: first specific, then general. Specifically: "neither constant nor impermanent"—dual negation at the ultimate of principle—is the Dharma-body. "Constant" is the reward-body: the reward wisdom and object united are also neither constant nor impermanent, but because it takes the perfected right wisdom as unborn and undying and is prior to the vajra-mind, it takes "constant" as the reward-body. "Both constant and impermanent" is the response-body: its responsive function is endless and thus "constant"; repeatedly proclaiming nirvāṇa is "impermanent." "Impermanent" refers to the increase of the function of wisdom before the vajra-mind, and even the arising and ceasing of ordinary beings are all impermanent. The three Buddhas each take one sentence; ordinary beings share one sentence—this is the Distinct teaching's specific differentiation. In the general Perfect explanation, each Tathāgata fully has the four sentences. For the Dharma-body's four: "neither constant nor impermanent" because it doubly breaks the eight inversions of ordinary and holy; "constant" because it is constant like space; "impermanent" because there is no inversion of ordinary-beings' arising and ceasing; "both constant and impermanent" because it is quiescent and doubly illuminates. For the reward-body's four: "neither constant nor impermanent" because wisdom merges with object; "constant" because it surpasses the Two Vehicles; "impermanent" because there is no inversion of arising and ceasing; "both constant and impermanent" because it can doubly illuminate. For the response-body's four: "neither constant nor impermanent" because it is neither reward nor saṃsāra; "constant" because it is constantly responding in the same way; "impermanent" because it accords with impermanence; "both constant and impermanent" because it preserves both. Since ordinary beings obtain the one sentence of impermanence, the general explanation also makes four sentences; yet there is only the principle of intrinsic virtue and not even the names of the four sentences, much less their practice and function. This can be understood by intent; there is no need to await explanation.**

**一身即是三身，不一不異，當知一佛身即具諸身壽命功德，隨緣感見長短不同。《大經》云「凡夫二乘見佛壽命猶如冬日，菩薩所見猶如春日，唯佛見佛壽命無量猶如夏日。所以然者，凡夫博地翳障朦朧，藏通二乘雖斷四住不見中道，若捨分段受法性身未破無明，彼土所奉猶是勝應，當知二乘秖見冬日。若諸菩薩未登地住，所見同前；若破無明乃至受分法身，與而為語得見報身壽命，奪而為語猶是勝應，未窮報身之源，未盡法性之極，所見佛壽猶是春日。唯佛與佛窮性盡源，見法身壽猶如夏日。」《大經》舉三譬譬之，於諸常中虛空第一，一切壽命如來第一，此譬法身壽命無始無終性相凝湛不同應報也；二譬如四河皆歸大海，此譬報身所修萬善皆感佛報壽命海中也；三阿耨達池出四大河，此譬應身壽命從法報出，同他長短也。此品詮量通明三身，若從別意正在報身。何以故？義便文會。義便者，報身智慧上冥下契，三身宛足，故言義便；文會者，我成佛已來甚大久遠，故能三世利益眾生，所成即法身，能成即報身，法報合故能益物，故言文會。以此推之，正意是論報身佛功德也。**

**One body is precisely the three bodies—neither one nor different. One should know that one Buddha-body fully contains the life-span and merits of all bodies; according to conditions, perceptions of long and short differ. The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says, "Ordinary beings and the Two Vehicles see the Buddha's life-span like a winter day; bodhisattvas see it like a spring day; only Buddha sees Buddha's life-span as immeasurable, like a summer day. Why is this? Ordinary beings on the broad ground are obscured and indistinct. Although the Tripiṭaka and Shared Two Vehicles have cut off the four abodes, they do not see the Middle Way; if they abandon the portioned body and receive the Dharma-nature body but have not broken ignorance, the land they奉 is still the superior response [body]. One should know the Two Vehicles only see the winter day. If bodhisattvas have not yet ascended to the grounds, what they see is the same as before; if they break ignorance and even receive a portion of the Dharma-body, speaking with concession they obtain vision of the reward-body's life-span; speaking by deprivation, it is still the superior response. They have not exhausted the source of the reward-body, nor fully exhausted the极 of Dharma-nature; thus what they see of the Buddha's life-span is still like a spring day. Only Buddha with Buddha exhausts nature and exhausts the source; seeing the Dharma-body life-span is like a summer day." The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* gives three analogies: among all constants, space is first; among all life-spans, the Tathāgata is first—this analogy is for the Dharma-body's life-span, without beginning or end, with nature and marks凝湛, unlike response or reward. Second, like the four rivers all return to the great ocean—this is an analogy that the myriad good practices cultivated by the reward-body all enter the ocean of the Buddha's reward life-span. Third, the Anavatapta Lake gives rise to the four great rivers—this is an analogy that the response-body's life-span comes forth from Dharma and reward, sharing others' long and short. This chapter's measuring generally clarifies the three bodies; from a specific standpoint it primarily concerns the reward-body. Why? The meaning is convenient and the text accords. "Meaning convenient" means: the reward-body's wisdom accords above and below, and the three bodies are complete—therefore it is convenient. "Text accords" means: since I became Buddha it has been extremely long ago; therefore I can benefit beings in the three times. What is accomplished is the Dharma-body; what accomplishes is the reward-body. Because Dharma and reward combine, they can benefit beings; therefore the text accords. By this inference, the primary intent is to discuss the merits of the reward-body Buddha.**

**復次，如是三身種種功德，悉是本時道場樹下先久成就，名之為本；中間今日寂滅道場所成就者，名之為迹。諸經所說本迹者，即寂滅道場所成法報為本；從本所起勝劣兩應為迹。今經所明，取寂場及中間所成三身，皆名為迹；取本昔道場所得三身，名之為本，故與諸經為異也。「非本無以垂迹，非迹無以顯本，本迹雖殊不思議一也。」肇師之言，意在寂場之本耳。**

**Furthermore, the various merits of the three bodies are all accomplished long ago under the bodhi tree at the original道場; this is called the origin. What is accomplished in the intermediate present quiescent道場 is called the trace. The origin and trace spoken of in other sutras take the Dharma and reward accomplished at the quiescent道場 as the origin, and the superior and inferior responses arising from the origin as traces. What this sutra clarifies takes the three bodies accomplished at the quiescent道場 and in the interim as traces; it takes the three bodies obtained at the original former道場 as the origin. Therefore it differs from other sutras. "Without the origin there is no way to cast down traces; without traces there is no way to manifest the origin. Though origin and trace are distinct, they are inconceivably one." This saying of Master Sengzhao has in mind the origin of the quiescent道場.**

---

**復次，寂場本迹復有多種，或以涅槃為本，從真起應為迹，迹本俱空言思雙斷，故不思議一也。或以俗為本，從俗起應為迹，迹本深廣，下地不能言思邊涯，故言不可思議一也。或以中為本，從中起應為迹，迹本皆言語道斷心行處滅，故云不思議一也。**

**Furthermore, the origin and trace of the quiescent道場 have many kinds. One may take nirvāṇa as origin and responsive manifestation arising from the real as trace; origin and trace are both empty, and speech and thought are doubly severed, therefore they are inconceivably one. One may take the conventional as origin and responsive manifestation arising from the conventional as trace; origin and trace are deep and broad, and those on lower grounds cannot speak or think their boundaries, therefore it is called inconceivably one. One may take the middle as origin and responsive manifestation arising from the middle as trace; origin and trace are both where speech is cut off and mind-activity extinguished, therefore it is called inconceivably one.**

---

**復次，此三非三亦復非一，非三非一為本，而三而一為迹，皆言語道斷心行處滅，不思議一也。未知諸師指何處本迹不思議一也。今攝𮒸四番，皆是迹中不思議一耳；遠指本地三番四番不可思議以為其本。從箇本而垂迹，將箇迹而顯本，本迹雖殊不思議一。如此本迹何得不異眾經？何得不異諸師？**

**Furthermore, these three are not three and also not one. The non-three and non-one is the origin; the three-and-one is the trace. All are where speech is cut off and mind-activity extinguished—inconceivably one. It is not known to which place the various masters point as the origin-and-trace inconceivably one. Now, gathering the first four turns, all are only the inconceivable one within the traces; the three and four turns that point far to the origin-ground's inconceivability are taken as the origin. From this origin one casts down traces; taking these traces one reveals the origin; though origin and trace are distinct, they are inconceivably one. With such origin and trace, how could it not differ from the other sutras? How could it not differ from the other masters?**

**Question: The various sutras speak of stages and practices, sometimes many, sometimes few. The *Avataṃsaka* has forty-one stages, the *Yingluo* has fifty-two stages; the names and meanings are all broad. This sutra from beginning to end has none of this. How can you say it is different?**

**答：譬如世人修種種業、集種種寶、求種種位，若無壽命用財位為？《大經》云「譬如長者生育一子，相師占之有短壽相，不任紹繼。父母知已，忽之如草。」法門亦爾，行種種因、獲種種果、現種種通、化種種眾、說種種法、度種種人，總在如來壽命海中，海中之要法性智應，喉襟目蒵非異是何？**

**Answer: It is like worldly people who cultivate various karmas, gather various treasures, and seek various positions—if there is no life-span, what use are wealth and position? The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says, "It is like a wealthy elder who gives birth to a son; the physiognomist divines that he has the sign of short life and is unfit to inherit. The parents, knowing this, neglect him like grass." The Dharma-gates are likewise: practicing various causes, obtaining various fruits, manifesting various penetrations, transforming various assemblies, speaking various dharmas, and delivering various people—all are within the ocean of the Tathāgata's life-span. Within that ocean, the essentials—Dharma-nature, wisdom, and response—are the throat, collar, eyes, and tendons; how could they be different?**

**In broadly opening the near and revealing the far, the text has two parts: first, admonishing faith; second, the direct answer. The Buddha's intent is to admonish the assembly to receive it as faith. This text has three admonitions and three requests, repeated requests and repeated admonitions. The Trace Gate has three requests and one admonition; here there are four requests and four admonitions. Together, before and after, there are five admonitions and seven requests—an extraordinary great matter, earnestly and solemnly stated. "Cheng" means loyal sincerity; "di" means verifying the real—speech that does not deceive things thus reaches truth. Formerly, the Seven Expedients followed others' intent and were not told as sincere truth; now he follows his own intent and shows the essential, therefore he says "sincere and true." Once the bodhisattvas accept this sincere admonition, they dare not give rise to doubt; upon hearing they must take faith, and accept the sincere words in faith.**

**正答有長行、偈頌。長行為二：法說、譬說。法說為二：一、三世益物，二、總結不虛。近情唯見現在八十，不知過去無央、未來不滅，故約三世開近顯遠。如此利益非獨我然，諸佛亦爾，故總結不虛也。法說中未來語少，譬說偈中文多(云云)。**

**The direct answer has prose and verses. The prose has two: dharma-explanation and parable-explanation. The dharma-explanation has two: (1) benefiting beings through the three times, (2) a general conclusion of "not false." Near-minded people see only the present eighty [years] and do not know the past is boundless or that the future does not extinguish; therefore he uses the three times to open the near and reveal the far. Such benefit is not only mine; all Buddhas are likewise, therefore it concludes "not false." In the dharma-explanation, words about the future are few; in the parable-explanation and verses, there are many (云云).**

**The passage on past benefit has two: (1) from "the Tathāgata's secret" downward, revealing the attachment to the near; (2) from "however, good sons" downward, breaking the near and revealing the far. The first has three: (1) reveal the dharma that is misunderstood; (2) reveal the beings who are misled; (3) reveal what is meant by being confused about the far. "Secret": one body is three bodies, named "secret"; the three bodies are one body, named "hidden"; moreover, what was not spoken in the past is called "secret"; what only the Buddha knows is called "hidden." "Power of spiritual penetrations" is the function of the three bodies: "spiritual" is the naturally unmoving principle, that is the Dharma-nature body; "penetration" is unobstructed inconceivable wisdom, that is the reward body; "power" is the自在 of operative function, that is the response body. The Buddha equally has the three bodies in the three times, but in the various teachings he kept them secret and did not transmit them; therefore all beings in the world—gods, humans, and asuras—say that the present Buddha first obtained these three bodies under the bodhi tree, thus clinging to the near and doubting the far. In this origin teaching, it does not again speak of the Two Vehicles, only addressing bodhisattvas. Bodhisattvas are included among the three good paths of humans, gods, and asuras; the other three evil destinies have heavy罪 and dull roots and little wisdom, and do not make such a statement. Therefore the *Great Prajñā* only says, "The Mahāyāna surpasses gods, humans, and asuras" and does not mention the three evil paths. Bodhisattvas are of three kinds: those from below, those from other lands, and those who have long been abiding. Those from below were transformed in the present; therefore they do not have attachment to the near. Those from other lands and those long abiding each have two kinds: (1) those born in response from the Dharma-body, who in past lives first attained the unborn, or who previously heard the revelation of traces and manifestation of origin; if they have not yet heard it, their reward is exhausted and they receive the Dharma-nature body, and on the Dharma-body ground they should naturally hear the long-ago teaching. Therefore response-born bodhisattvas mostly do not have attachment to the near; (2) those who in this life have just attained the patience of the unborn and those who have not yet attained it all have this attachment.**

**「然善男子我實成佛已來」下，第二，明破執遣迷以顯久遠之本，上文誠諦之誡即是此也。就此復二：一、顯遠，二、從「自從是來」下，明過去益物所宜。就初又二：一、法說顯遠，二、舉譬格量法說。成佛已來甚大久遠，伽耶近謂即破，破近顯遠略有十意，如《玄義》(云云)。此文正用破近顯遠，破近謂情廢近顯遠，廢於近教也。**

**From "However, good sons, since I truly became Buddha" downward is the second: clarifying the breaking of attachment and dispelling delusion to reveal the far-ago origin. The sincere admonition above is precisely this. Here again there are two: (1) reveal the far, (2) from "since then" downward, clarify what is appropriate for past benefit. The first again has two: (1) dharma-explanation revealing the far, (2) raising a parable to measure and explain the dharma. "Since I became Buddha it has been extremely long"—the near statement about Gayā is thereby broken. Breaking the near to reveal the far has ten meanings in brief, as in the *Profound Meaning* (云云). This text precisely uses breaking the near and revealing the far; "breaking the near" means abolishing attachment to the near and revealing the far, thus abolishing the near teaching.**

**The parable has three: (1) raising the parable question, (2) answer, (3) matching, to reveal the long-ago. Other sutras may clarify numbers as indescribable, using dust and sand as metaphors; compared to this, those are many. Simply the worlds that are dotted by the dust below are already indescribable; how much less the dust not below—how could that be described? The dust-below and dust-not-below worlds are already indescribable; how could the dust-below and dust-not-below dust itself be describable? How much more what exceeds that—how could it be described? From "Maitreya and the others" downward, second, the answer raises three persons who do not know. The matching parable is as in the text.**

**從「自從是來」下，明益物所宜又三：一、益物處，二、拂迹上疑，三、從「若有眾生來至我所」下，正明益物所宜。須顯處者，上引譬甚久，久居何處？故云常在此土及於他國而作佛事，如文。「於是中間」下，拂執迹上之疑，疑因疑果，昔教所說處處行因，又處處得記即是果疑。今拂除此疑，指然燈佛者即拂因疑，又復言其入於涅槃即拂果疑，如此因果非復一條，皆我方便非實說也，故名拂疑。或有人云，方便說然燈佛是我之師，然實是釋迦現作，非生現生、非滅現滅，故言又復言其涅槃。今謂不爾，但取前釋。何者？然燈佛于時緣熟，以佛像化之；我緣未熟，但為菩薩從佛得記，得記即是果義，行行即是因，消文自足。言「其」者，即是中間施化之其耳，非謂然燈也。又中間益物，即有形聲兩益，若言值然燈佛者，此有形益，又復言其入於涅槃者，彼佛滅後助佛揚化，即有聲益，若爾形聲兩益，皆屬中間因耳。既有形聲之生，生必有死，死即入涅槃，名此為果耳。不得言中間已成佛果，何者？《法華》之前未說成佛，何得有佛果之疑？舊以然燈是我現作，此亦非解，《法華》前經未論昔已成佛，何教說然燈是我所現而拂此疑耶？「若有眾生來至我所」下，第三正明益物所宜，又為二：一、感應，二、施化。「至我所」者，即是過去眾生漸頓兩機冥扣法身也。「佛眼觀」者，即是久已成佛，用佛眼鑑照無有遺差，將欲起於劣勝兩應而利益之。善機凡有二力：一、感人天花報，二、感佛道果報。若以法眼觀知萬善，緣其重輕各得花報，不能究竟知其終得種智果報；若以佛眼，圓照萬善知其始末。此經一向明佛眼觀知眾生萬善究竟得佛，一大事出世之正意也。「信等諸根」者，信等五根也，慧根即了因，餘根即緣因。此二善根各有利鈍，通攝頓漸機緣：頓機利鈍即是圓、別根機，漸機利鈍即是藏、通機緣。又小乘根名鈍，大乘根名利。又小乘根名利，人天乘名鈍。十法界眾生所有善根利鈍為機，不用惡法，惡法非緣、了二因也。如來悉照十界善機，隨所應度而現形聲饒益也。從「處處自說」下，正明應化所宜，又二：先、形聲益，次、得益歡喜。先、形益又二：先明非生現生，次非滅現滅。「自說名字不同」者，形既其現則有名字，因名召體，機有優劣、形有勝負，形異故名則不同。「年紀大小」者，即形勝負，勝者即勝應，負者即劣應也。「名不同」者，即二佛現壽有量無量也。「處處」者，竪論則過去之處處行因國土也，橫論即十方國土也。名字不同約竪處所，亦有生法名字不同，如今之應身望過去然燈佛等；約橫國土亦有生法名字，如今之望分身，亦如《華嚴》十號中所列釋迦異名若干不同。又諸經所辯，佛有三身名字不同，所召法體皆異，或說毘那、或舍那、或釋迦，法身佛或名如如、實相、第一義、般若、楞嚴等比也。此約示現佛法界身名字不同，若現九法界身名字不同，則無量無邊，可以意得。「年紀大小」者，此明壽命長短，逐上所現應身，或說壽二萬，如迦葉佛時；或說壽八萬時，如彌勒佛時，傳互明大小縱橫可知。就法報應佛壽命大小，如《玄義》(云云)。或三身相望辯大小，或三身各別皆為小、合說名為大，例三點(云云)。此皆隨所應度，為其現身及命長短耳。「亦復現言當入涅槃」者，應以滅度而得度者，即現滅度也，令其戀仰而得解脫。此義現下譬說中也。「又以種種方便說微妙法」者，是現聲益也。小身短壽即是說於漸教，故言「種種方便」也。大身長壽即是說頓教，故言「說微妙法」。雖初以漸，終令入大，故言「皆令得歡喜」。仍此歡喜即是施化得益，佛依四悉檀，施形聲兩益，眾生獲於四利，稱機則喜、乖機則惱，下文云「皆實不虛」，即此義也。**

**From "since then" downward, it clarifies what is appropriate for benefiting beings, again in three: (1) the place of benefiting beings, (2) dispelling the doubts about traces, (3) from "if there are beings who come to me" downward, directly clarifying what is appropriate for benefiting beings. It must reveal the place: above it cited a parable of great length; where did he dwell for so long? Therefore it says he always abides in this land and in other lands performing Buddha-works, as in the text. From "during this interval" downward, it dispels doubts about traces—doubts about cause and doubts about fruit. The former teachings spoke of practicing causes in many places, and obtaining predictions in many places is precisely doubt about fruit. Now it dispels these doubts: pointing to Dīpaṃkara Buddha dispels cause-doubt; and again speaking of his entering nirvāṇa dispels fruit-doubt. Such cause and fruit are no longer a single strand; all are my expedients, not real statements—therefore it is called dispelling doubt. Some say: it is expediently said that Dīpaṃkara Buddha is my teacher, yet in reality it is Śākyamuni's manifestation—non-birth manifesting birth, non-extinction manifesting extinction—therefore it says again that he entered nirvāṇa. Now we say it is not so; we only take the prior explanation. Why? At that time, Dīpaṃkara's conditions were ripe and he transformed with a Buddha image. My conditions were not yet ripe; I was only a bodhisattva receiving prediction from the Buddha. Receiving prediction is the meaning of fruit; practice upon practice is the cause—thus the text is sufficient. The word "that" refers to the "that" of the middle period of transformation, not to Dīpaṃkara. Moreover, the middle-period benefit has two benefits, form and sound: if it says "met Dīpaṃkara Buddha," this is form-benefit; and again saying "entered nirvāṇa" means that after that Buddha's extinction he assisted the Buddha's propagation—this is sound-benefit. If so, the two benefits of form and sound both belong to the middle-period causes. Once there is birth of form and sound, there must be death; death is entering nirvāṇa—this is named fruit. One must not say that the middle period already achieved Buddha-fruit. Why? Before the *Lotus*, Buddhahood was not spoken of; how could there be doubt about Buddha-fruit? The old interpretation says Dīpaṃkara was my manifestation; this is also not correct. The sutras before the *Lotus* did not discuss past Buddhahood; what teaching said Dīpaṃkara was my manifestation to dispel this doubt? From "if there are beings who come to me" downward, third, it directly clarifies what is appropriate for benefiting beings, again in two: (1)感應, (2)施化. "Come to me" refers to past beings with gradual and sudden capacities, secretly knocking on the Dharma-body. "Buddha-eye observes" means: I have long since become Buddha, using the Buddha-eye to inspect and illuminate without遗漏, about to arouse the inferior and superior two responses and benefit them. Good capacities have two powers: (1) to感 the flower-retribution of humans and gods, (2) to感 the果-retribution of Buddha-way. If one uses the Dharma-eye to observe and know myriad good, according to their weight and lightness each obtains the flower retribution, but one cannot ultimately know their final attainment of the all-seed wisdom果. If one uses the Buddha-eye, one fully illuminates all good and knows their beginning and end. This sutra consistently clarifies that the Buddha-eye observes and knows that beings' myriad good ultimately obtain Buddhahood—this is the primary intent of the Buddha's one great cause for appearing in the world. "Faith and the other roots" are the five roots of faith and so on. The wisdom-root is the cause of understanding; the other roots are causes of conditions. These two good roots each have sharp and dull, broadly encompassing gradual and sudden capacities: the sudden capacities, sharp and dull, are the Perfect and Distinct faculties; the gradual capacities, sharp and dull, are the Tripiṭaka and Shared faculties. Again, Small Vehicle faculties are called dull, Great Vehicle faculties are called sharp; again, Small Vehicle faculties are called sharp, and the human and heavenly vehicle is called dull. The good roots of beings in the ten Dharma Realms, sharp and dull, are their capacities. Evil dharmas are not used; evil dharmas are not the two causes of condition and understanding. The Tathāgata fully illuminates the good capacities of the ten realms, and according to what should be度 he manifests form and sound to benefit. From "in each place, he himself speaks" downward, it directly clarifies what is appropriate for response-transformation, again in two: first, form-and-sound benefit; second, benefit and rejoicing. First, form benefit has two: first, clarifying non-birth manifesting birth; second, non-extinction manifesting extinction. "He himself speaks names that are different": once form is manifested, there are names; by names the body is called. Capacities have superiority and inferiority; forms have胜 and负; since forms differ, names differ. "Years, large and small" means the superiority and inferiority of form: superiority is the superior response; inferiority is the inferior response. "Names differ" means the two Buddhas manifest life-spans with measure and without measure. "In each place"—vertically, it refers to the past places where causes were practiced and the lands; horizontally, it refers to the lands of the ten directions. Names differing in the vertical places also means names of birth dharmas differ, as when the present response-body is seen in relation to past Buddhas such as Dīpaṃkara. In terms of horizontal lands, there are also different names of birth dharmas, as when the present is seen in relation to emanated bodies; likewise in the *Avataṃsaka*'s ten titles, Śākyamuni's different names are listed in many differences. Moreover, the sutras辨 that the Buddha has three bodies with different names; the Dharma-body or its called essence are all different: sometimes called Vina, sometimes Śana, sometimes Śākyamuni; the Dharma-body Buddha is sometimes called suchness, real mark, First Principle, Prajñā, Śūraṅgama, and the like. This is in terms of the manifested Buddha Dharma-realm body's differing names. If one manifests the nine Dharma-realm bodies with differing names, then they are immeasurable and boundless and can be understood by intent. "Years, large and small" here clarifies length and shortness of life-span, following the above manifested response-bodies: sometimes it says life-span is twenty thousand, as in the time of Buddha Kāśyapa; sometimes it says life-span is eighty thousand, as in the time of Maitreya Buddha. The transmission mutually clarifies large and small; vertical and horizontal can be understood. As for the Dharma, reward, and response Buddhas' life-span sizes, see the *Profound Meaning* (云云). One may辨大小 by comparing the three bodies; or each of the three bodies can separately be small, and when combined they are called great—by the example of the three dots (云云). All these are according to what should be度, manifesting the body and life-span length accordingly. "Again, he manifests saying he will enter nirvāṇa" means: for those who should be度 by extinction, he manifests extinction, causing longing and thus liberation. This meaning appears below in the parable-explanation. "Again, he uses various expedients to speak the subtle Dharma" is the manifestation of sound-benefit. A small body and short life mean speaking the gradual teaching, therefore it says "various expedients." A great body and long life mean speaking the sudden teaching, therefore it says "speaking the subtle Dharma." Though at first gradual, in the end he causes entry into the Great, therefore it says "all cause [them] to rejoice." This rejoicing is precisely the benefit obtained through transformation. The Buddha, relying on the Four Siddhāntas, bestows the two benefits of form and sound; beings obtain the four benefits: when it accords with their capacity they rejoice, when it conflicts they are vexed. The text below says "all are truly not false"—this is the meaning.**

**從「諸善男子如來見諸眾生」下，是現在師子奮迅益物。此三昧有十功德：一、分別他人諸根熟不熟清淨不清淨；二、以如來法輪教未度者悉入法律；三、弘誓遍滿十方音聲亦爾，或一音遍滿，百千萬音皆亦遍滿普教眾類；四、轉無上輪化眾生皆取滅度，餘人不能轉獨佛能轉；五、能示出家剃髮持淨戒，亦能使人樂；六、性行合空；七、放光示滅或存或亡，或示相好或隱相好；八、降伏四魔；九、令他得入至要增長止觀；十、具上十善之本，身三口四等(云云)。此文為二：一、明機感，二、明應化。「如來見」者，即佛眼照也。「諸眾生樂小法」者，所見之機也。《華嚴》云「大眾雖清淨，其餘樂小法者，或生疑悔長夜衰惱，愍此故默。」偈云「其餘不久行，智慧未明了，依識不依智，聞已生憂悔，彼將墜惡道，念此故不說」。按彼經無聲聞二乘，但指不久行者，為樂小法人耳。師云，樂小者非小乘人也，乃是樂近說者為小耳。今當通說之，所謂貪愛二十五有，即人天之機，來至我所名小法也；貪樂涅槃求自解脫，即二乘之機來至我所，亦名樂小法也；樂於漸次紆迴佛道，即三菩薩機來至我所，亦名樂小法也。「德薄」者，緣了二善功用微劣。下文云「諸子幼稚」也。「垢重」者，見、思未除也。**

**From "Good sons, the Tathāgata sees sentient beings" downward is the present lion's奋迅 benefiting beings. This samādhi has ten merits: (1) distinguishing whether others' faculties are mature or not, pure or not; (2) with the Tathāgata's Dharma-wheel, teaching those not yet度 so that all enter the Dharma-law; (3) great vows pervade the ten directions and sound likewise—one sound may pervade, and hundreds of thousands of sounds likewise pervade, universally teaching the classes of beings; (4) turning the unsurpassed wheel, transforming beings so that all take extinction; others cannot turn it, only the Buddha can; (5) able to show leaving home, shaving hair, holding pure precepts, and also able to make people delight; (6) nature and practice unite with emptiness; (7) emitting light and showing extinction—sometimes abiding, sometimes gone; sometimes showing marks, sometimes hiding marks; (8) subduing the four māras; (9) enabling others to enter the crucial essentials and increase stopping and contemplation; (10) possessing the basis of the ten good deeds—three of body, four of mouth, and so on (云云). This passage has two: (1) clarifying capacity and response, (2) clarifying response-transformation. "The Tathāgata sees" means the Buddha-eye illuminates. "Sentient beings who delight in small dharmas" indicates the capacities seen. The *Avataṃsaka* says, "Though the great assembly is pure, those who delight in small dharmas may give rise to doubt and regret, long-night decline and suffering; out of pity for this he remains silent." The verse says, "The rest do not practice for long; wisdom is not yet clear. Relying on consciousness, not relying on wisdom, after hearing they give rise to sorrow and regret; they will fall into evil paths; thinking of this he does not speak." According to that sutra, there are no śrāvaka Two Vehicles; it only points to those who do not practice for long as those who delight in small dharmas. The Master says: those who delight in the small are not necessarily Small Vehicle people; rather, those who delight in near teaching are called "small." Now, in general: craving the twenty-five existences is the capacity of humans and gods; coming to me is called small dharmas. Craving nirvāṇa and seeking self-liberation is the capacity of the Two Vehicles; coming to me is also called delighting in small dharmas. Delighting in gradual and circuitous Buddha-path is the capacity of the three bodhisattva vehicles; coming to me is also called delighting in small dharmas. "Thin virtue" means that the two goods of conditioning and understanding have weak function. The text below says, "the children are immature." "Heavy defilement" means views and thoughts have not been removed.**

**問：非生現生，備施頓漸二化，七方便等可是樂小法者，圓頓赴機是應樂大法者，云何通判為樂小法耶？**

**Question: If non-birth manifests birth, fully applying the two transformations of sudden and gradual, then the Seven Expedients and the like can be called those who delight in small dharmas; and those who respond to perfect-sudden capacities should delight in great dharmas. Why, then, are they generally classified as those who delight in small dharmas?**

---

**答：向略其意，今廣釋，凡為四義：一、約往日，雖發大心不能專精，多著弊欲不得出世，名弊欲為小法也。二、約現在，如佛未出世，諸天人等雖有大機，而心染世樂著於邪見，故名樂小法。此二義與下譬「宛轉于地」意同也。三、約修行，雖不樂於三界弊欲小法，而樂三乘灰斷亦名小法；雖不樂於三乘近果，而樂歷別修於一乘，不能於一心圓頓普修，故名樂小。此三意約因門，明樂小法也。四、約果門，樂聞近成之小，出釋氏宮始得菩提，不欲樂聞長遠大久之道，故言樂小。此等小心非始今日，若先樂大，佛即不說始成，說始成者皆為樂小法者耳。**

**Answer: Earlier we briefly stated the meaning; now we explain broadly, in four meanings. (1) In terms of the past: though they aroused the great mind, they could not focus; they were mostly attached to base desires and could not leave the world. Thus those base desires are called small dharmas. (2) In terms of the present: if the Buddha has not yet appeared in the world, gods and humans may have great capacity, yet their minds are stained by worldly pleasure and attached to wrong views; therefore they are called those who delight in small dharmas. These two meanings accord with the later parable's idea of "rolling on the ground." (3) In terms of cultivation: though they do not delight in the base desires of the three realms (small dharmas), they delight in the three vehicles' ash-like cessation, which is also called small dharmas. Though they do not delight in the near fruits of the three vehicles, they delight in sequential and partial cultivation of the One Vehicle, unable to universally cultivate the perfect-sudden in one mind; therefore it is called delighting in small. These three meanings are in terms of the cause gate, clarifying delighting in small dharmas. (4) In terms of the fruit gate: they delight in hearing the small of near attainment—leaving the Śākya palace and first attaining bodhi—and do not wish to delight in hearing the long-ago, great and vast path; therefore it is called delighting in small. Such small-mindedness is not only today. If they had first delighted in the great, the Buddha would not speak of initial attainment; those for whom he speaks of initial attainment are all those who delight in small dharmas.**

**「為是人說」下，第二，現在應化，又二：一、非生現生，二、非滅現滅。現生又二：一、現生，二、利益。現生又二：一、現生，二、非生。現生者迹現於生，非生者非始爾生也。為是人說我始得菩提，前明利鈍二機來感法身，今即現勝劣兩應，劣應應鈍根、勝應應利根。此兩應並有生法二身生，劣應二身生者，以正慧託胎，出生行七步，如迦旃延子所述，乃至六年苦行已還，是名生身生也。法身生者，即三十四心斷結習盡，所得五分法身是也。勝應生身生者，如《華嚴》、《大經》等說，與諸菩薩處摩耶胎常說大乘，出行十方各各七步，是名生身生。法身生者，於寂滅道場，金剛後心斷無明盡，得妙覺相應慧窮照法性，萬德種智圓明普備，是名法身生。「出家者」，劣應出分段家，勝應出二死家。「得菩提」者，劣應得有作四諦所發無漏盡無生智，名為菩提；勝應即照三諦一實之道，一切種智為菩提也。「然我實成」下，明本實不生，但天人修羅，見此二種生法二身謂言始生，此則不然。然我久已得此生法二身，今日之生非實生也，故云「久遠若斯」。「若斯」者，如上譬之長久也。「但以方便」下，明既非實生，何故現生？為利樂小法人德薄垢重者使得佛道，故言「但以方便教化眾生」。「作如是說」者，非生而現生，故云「作如是說」也。餘經破劣應生身生非生，尚不破劣應法身生非生；今經正破勝應法身生非生。何者？我實成佛已來久遠若斯，故知今日劣勝兩法身生皆被破故生非生，與餘經永異也。「如來所演」下，第二，明現生形聲益：先明形聲，次明不虛。說即聲教、示即形現。形聲不出自他，若說法身是說己身，若說應身是說他身益；言值然燈佛即是說己身，然燈是我師，是說他身；示正報是自己事，示現依報是示他事；隨他意語是說他身，隨自意語是說己身。示己他事，亦類如此。「諸所言說皆實不虛」者，又二：先、明不虛，次、釋不虛。初偏據聲益不虛，釋則雙釋不虛。初不虛者，漸頓二機稟此二種形聲皆益不虛。上過去章明皆歡喜，似如世界之益，今明皆不虛，勝劣形聲逗於二機，獲四悉檀皆不虛也。《大論》明四悉檀並實，世界故實，對治為人故實，篤而為論，三是世間實此實則虛，緣中亦有世間三實、第一義則虛，若以此虛實約迹本二門，漸頓益者虛實，昔方便行未得實道之益，是其因虛，執於近迹未得本地真實之益，即是果虛；今聞迹門之說同入實相，即得因中實益，聞本門之說，即除執近之情，得於長遠果地之實益。今得二實對昔二虛。約圓頓眾生，於迹本二門一實一虛得中道之行，是得因中之實益而執近果，是於果虛；今聞說因更不別得真實之益，聞說遠果即得實果之益，昔有一虛今得一實，故云皆實不虛也。**

**From "For these people he says" downward is the second: present response-transformation, again in two: (1) non-birth manifesting birth, (2) non-extinction manifesting extinction. Manifesting birth again has two: (1) manifesting birth, (2) benefit. Manifesting birth again has two: (1) manifesting birth, (2) not-birth. Manifesting birth means traces manifest as birth; not-birth means it was not that at the beginning. "For these people he says I first attained bodhi": above it clarified the two capacities, sharp and dull, that come and感 the Dharma-body; now he manifests two responses, superior and inferior. The inferior response corresponds to dull roots; the superior response corresponds to sharp roots. These two responses both have two births, the birth of the physical body and the birth of the Dharma-body. The inferior response's two-body birth: with right wisdom he enters the womb, is born and walks seven steps, as described by Kātyāyana's son, and even returns after six years of ascetic practice—this is called the birth of the physical body. The Dharma-body birth is: in the thirty-four minds he cuts off bonds and habits to exhaustion and attains the five-part Dharma-body. The superior response's physical-body birth: as said in the *Avataṃsaka* and the *Mahāparinirvāṇa* and the like, he dwells in the womb of Māyā with the bodhisattvas, constantly preaching the Great Vehicle; after emergence he walks seven steps in each of the ten directions—this is called the birth of the physical body. The Dharma-body birth is: at the quiescent道場, after the vajra mind he cuts off ignorance to exhaustion, attains the wisdom that corresponds with wondrous awakening and illuminates Dharma-nature to the limit; the myriad virtues and all-seed wisdom are perfectly bright and fully endowed—this is called the birth of the Dharma-body. "Leaving home": the inferior response leaves the portioned-birth-and-death household; the superior response leaves the two-deaths household. "Attaining bodhi": the inferior response attains the non-outflow, exhausted, non-arising wisdom produced by the constructed Four Truths—this is called bodhi; the superior response directly illuminates the path of the One Reality of the Three Truths, and all-seed wisdom is bodhi. From "But I truly became" downward, it clarifies that in the origin it is truly unborn; yet gods, humans, and asuras, seeing these two kinds of birth and the two bodies, say it is initial birth—this is not so. I have long since attained these two bodies of birth-and-dharma; today's birth is not true birth, therefore it says "so long-ago." "So long-ago" means long as in the parable above. From "only by expedient means" downward, it clarifies: since it is not true birth, why manifest birth? To benefit those who delight in small dharmas, with thin virtue and heavy defilements, so that they obtain the Buddha Way; therefore it says, "only by expedient means I teach and transform beings." "He says thus" means: not-birth yet manifesting birth; therefore it says "he says thus." Other sutras break the inferior response's physical-body birth as not-birth, yet do not break the inferior response's Dharma-body birth as not-birth; this sutra directly breaks the superior response's Dharma-body birth as not-birth. Why? Since I truly became Buddha long ago, therefore one knows that today the inferior and superior Dharma-body births are both broken—thus birth is not birth—forever differing from other sutras. From "what the Tathāgata expounds" downward, second, it clarifies the benefits of form and sound in manifesting birth: first clarifying form and sound, then clarifying not-false. Speaking is sound-teaching; showing is form-manifestation. Form and sound do not go beyond self and other. If one speaks of the Dharma-body, it is speaking one's own body; if one speaks of the response-body, it is speaking benefit to others. Saying he met Dīpaṃkara Buddha is speaking one's own body; Dīpaṃkara being my teacher is speaking another's body. Showing the direct retribution is one's own affair; manifesting the dependent retribution is another's affair. Following others' intent is speaking another's body; following one's own intent is speaking one's own body. Showing one's own and others' affairs is likewise. "All that is said is truly not false" is again two: first, clarifying not-false; second, explaining not-false. First, not-false is primarily about sound-benefit; in explanation, it is both. First, not-false: gradual and sudden capacities receive these two kinds of form and sound, and the benefits are all not false. Above, in the past section, it says all rejoice—this seems like a worldly benefit; now it says all are not false. Superior and inferior form and sound meet the two capacities; the four Siddhāntas are all not false. The *Great Treatise* clarifies that the Four Siddhāntas are all real: the worldly is real, the therapeutic-for-person is real. Strictly speaking, the three are worldly real, yet this real is empty; in conditions, there are also three worldly reals, while the First Principle is empty. If one uses this emptiness and realness to interpret the Trace and Origin gates: for gradual and sudden benefits, there are empty and real. Formerly, the expedient practices had not yet obtained the real path's benefit—this is cause-empty. Clinging to the near traces and not yet obtaining the true benefit of the origin-ground is fruit-empty. Now, hearing the Trace Gate teaching, one enters the real mark together and obtains real benefit in the cause; hearing the Origin Gate teaching, one removes attachment to the near and obtains real benefit of the long-ago fruit-ground. Thus now one gains two reals, contrasted with the former two empties. For perfect-sudden beings, in the Trace and Origin gates there is one real and one empty; attaining the Middle Way practice is obtaining real benefit in the cause while clinging to the near fruit—this is fruit-empty. Now, upon hearing the teaching of cause, there is no further separate real benefit; upon hearing the teaching of far fruit, one obtains real benefit of the fruit. Formerly there was one empty; now one gains one real. Therefore it says all are truly not false.**

By analogy, entry into the true meaning: the dull rely on analysis of dharmas and contemplation of impermanence and the like; the sharp use contemplation of the emptiness of dharmas' substance. Therefore the Tripiṭaka and Shared are distinguished.**

**從「所以者何如來如實知見」下，第二，總釋益物不虛。先、釋形益，後、釋言益不虛。此中六句顯於應身不離法身，法身無形亦無起滅，眾生有起滅之機感於法身，如來願力應同起滅，起滅之見出自眾生，故約三界以明諸句。又為二：一、照理不虛，二、從「以諸眾生」下，明稱機不虛，達理稱機、設教化物，必不虛也。「如實知見」即是實智，如理而照三界之實，實則無三界之因相也。「無有生死」者，無有二死之苦也。起集名「退」，無常果現名「出」也，亦無在生死之世及入涅槃之滅，此二俱滅，故云「亦無在世及滅度者」。非於滅度之實，非於生死之虛，故云「非實非虛」也。非於世間之隔異，非於出世之真如，故云「非如非異」。此四明中道也。若雙非二邊，結句定一邊，例如非生非死結句為生，是生是死結句為死，是退是出結句為退，非退非出結句為出，非虛非實結句為實，是虛是實結句為虛，如此之流今皆非之，乃至單複具足亦非之，方顯中道意耳。「不如三界見於三界」者，不如二種三界眾生所見三界之相，唯佛一人如實窮照三界之實，內具實智之用，亦是隨自意語，亦是或說己身之事，故《大品》云「第一義中無所分別」也。如來權智如量知見三界之相，即如三界眾生之見，如實知見無二死，而隨他意示二死身說有二死；無退無出而隨他意說有退有出；亦無在世及滅度者，而隨他意示生世間示入涅槃，說有在世有得滅者；無實而說涅槃之實，無虛而說三界之虛；無三世之異而說有異，無真諦之如而說有如。同於三界見於三界，皆是隨他意語，名為或說他身事、示他身事。如來二智明審二諦，所以形言兩益，皆實不虛也。「以諸眾生下」，第二，釋稱機不虛：先明機感，次論施化。以諸眾生根機利鈍漸頓不同、性欲行智種種差別，欲令各得增諸善根，故說己他之教，不虛因緣譬喻也。漸頓根性各有種種，此須用為人悉檀，為人悉檀正為生諸善根。善根猶是性，習欲成性，今何故先性後欲？釋云，因有本日根性，能起今日之欲樂，如因煩惱故有五陰，復因五陰更有煩惱，不前不後；性欲亦爾，要因習欲而成性也。欲者漸頓二機，若種種欲樂不同，此須用世界悉檀也。行者起作業行，隨樂欲而修諸行也，此須用為人悉檀也。行中好多愛著致有妨障，此須對治悉檀。憶想者是智慧即相似解，由修行故能得解生，此是方便猶未稱理，無言說道，猶是念想之觀，漸頓眾生居在內外凡位，有諸善根欲樂，欲樂故修行，修行故得似解，此須用第一義悉檀，隨其所得憶想之解更為說法，即得朗悟第一義。乃至初地欲樂修行二地時，亦憶想二地之境，即是念想；若發生二地真解，即是念想觀除、言語法滅，乃至佛方得究竟離於憶想，獲常寂照耳。「欲令生」下，第二，正對機。施己他聲益，於漸頓種種根機，令生種種善根，故現若干己他身事、若干自他聲教、若干因緣譬喻。若對漸機，以三藏中四門若干因緣譬喻，於一一門中復有若干，如為懈怠者說苦忍，為我慢者說無常忍等。通教四門亦如是，若對頓機如別圓等，亦各四門若干種種，如三十二菩薩各說入不二法門，《華嚴》中種種行類相貌，皆為種種根機，施若干譬喻言辭說法也。「所作佛事未曾暫廢」者，總結不虛。如上若干己他形聲，皆令眾生入佛知見，不為人天二乘小事，故云「所作佛事」也。若一人獨得滅度，餘人不得者，所作佛事即為有廢，廢即令眾不得實益，豈得會皆實不虛？云何皆實？昔云我坐道場不得一法實，七方便並非究竟滅，二涅槃者方便空拳，故知唯虛未見皆實。若昔施七權遂不得入一實者，可言其虛。虛引得出，無有虛出而不入實者，故知昔虛為實故也。皆實不虛佛事無廢，即此義矣。**

**From "For what reason? The Tathāgata truly knows and sees" downward is the second: a general explanation that benefiting beings is not false. First, it explains the benefit of form; later, it explains that the benefit of speech is not false. Here, six phrases reveal that the response-body is not separate from the Dharma-body. The Dharma-body is formless and has no arising or ceasing. Beings with the capacity for arising and ceasing感 the Dharma-body; by the Tathāgata's vow-power he responds in accord with arising and ceasing. The view of arising and ceasing comes from beings; therefore these phrases are explained by way of the three realms. It is also two: (1) illumination of principle is not false; (2) from "with regard to beings" downward, clarifying that accord with capacities is not false. Understanding principle and matching capacities, establishing teachings to transform beings—none of this is false. "Truly knows and sees" is real wisdom, illuminating the reality of the three realms according to principle; in reality there is no causal mark of the three realms. "There is no birth-and-death" means there is no suffering of the two deaths. The arising of accumulation is called "retreat"; the manifestation of the impermanent fruit is called "emergence." There is also no abiding in the world of birth-and-death and no entering the extinction of nirvāṇa; both are extinguished, therefore it says "there is also no abiding in the world nor entering extinction." It is not the real of extinction, not the empty of birth-and-death; therefore it says "neither real nor empty." It is not the separation and difference of the worldly, not the suchness of the supramundane; therefore it says "neither thus nor different." These four clarify the Middle Way. If one doubly negates the two extremes, the concluding phrase fixes one side. For example: "neither birth nor death" concludes as birth; "is birth and death" concludes as death. "Is retreat and emergence" concludes as retreat; "neither retreat nor emergence" concludes as emergence. "Neither empty nor real" concludes as real; "is empty and real" concludes as empty. All such cases are negated here; even singly, doubly, or fully, they are negated—only then is the Middle Way intent revealed. "Not as the three realms see the three realms" means: it is not like the two kinds of beings of the three realms who see the marks of the three realms. Only the Buddha alone truly and fully illuminates the reality of the three realms; inwardly he possesses the function of real wisdom—this is also speech following his own intent, and can be called speaking his own body's affairs. Therefore the *Great Prajñā* says, "In the First Principle there is no distinction." The Tathāgata's provisional wisdom knows and sees the marks of the three realms in accord with measure, just like the view of beings in the three realms. But his true knowledge and vision have no two deaths; yet following others' intent he shows the two-deaths body and speaks of two deaths. Having no retreat or emergence, he follows others' intent and speaks of retreat and emergence. Having no abiding in the world or entering extinction, he follows others' intent and shows birth in the world and entry into nirvāṇa, speaking of abiding in the world and attaining extinction. Having no real, he speaks of the real of nirvāṇa; having no empty, he speaks of the empty of the three realms. Having no difference of three times, he speaks of difference; having no suchness of true principle, he speaks of suchness. Seeing the three realms as the three realms is all speech following others' intent, called sometimes speaking another's body-affairs, sometimes showing another's body-affairs. The Tathāgata's two wisdoms clearly discern the two truths; therefore the two benefits of form and speech are all truly not false. "With regard to beings"—second, explaining that accord with capacities is not false. First clarifying capacity and response, then discussing施化. Because beings' faculties—sharp or dull, gradual or sudden—differ, and their natures, desires, practices, and wisdom differ, he wishes each to increase their good roots; therefore he speaks the teachings of self and other—not false in causes, conditions, and parables. Gradual and sudden roots each have their many kinds; for this, the For-the-Person Siddhānta must be used—the For-the-Person Siddhānta is precisely for producing good roots. Good roots are still "nature"; habitual desire becomes nature. Why then first nature and then desire? The explanation says: because there is prior root-nature, it can give rise to today's desires—like how, because of afflictions, there are the five aggregates, and because of the five aggregates, there are further afflictions; neither is prior nor posterior. Nature and desire are also thus: only by habitual desires does nature become. Desires are the two capacities, gradual and sudden; if the various desires differ, the Worldly Siddhānta must be used. Practitioners undertake karmic practices, cultivating various practices according to what they delight in; this requires the For-the-Person Siddhānta. In practice, many loves and attachments lead to obstructions; this requires the Therapeutic Siddhānta. "Recollection" is wisdom, that is, a similar understanding; by practice one can gain an understanding. This is still expedient and not yet in accord with principle; it is a contemplative of thought, without the path of speech; it is still contemplative of mental images. Gradual and sudden beings dwell in inner and outer ordinary positions; they have various good roots and desires. Because of desires they cultivate; because of cultivation they obtain similar understanding. This requires the First Principle Siddhānta: according to the understanding attained from recollection, he further teaches the Dharma, and then they clearly awaken the First Principle. Even to the first ground, one desires to practice in the second ground and still recalls the境 of the second ground—this is recollection; if the true understanding of the second ground arises, then the recollecting contemplation is removed and speech and dharmas are extinguished. Only at Buddhahood is one ultimately free from recollection and obtains constant, quiescent illumination. From "to cause [them] to produce" downward, second, directly matching capacities: he bestows the sound-benefit of self and other; among gradual and sudden capacities of various kinds, he causes them to produce various good roots. Therefore he manifests various self-and-other body-affairs, various self-and-other sound teachings, and various causes, conditions, and parables. For gradual capacities, he uses the Tripiṭaka's four doors with various causes, conditions, and parables; within each door there are further varieties, such as speaking of patience toward suffering for the lazy, speaking of impermanence patience for the arrogant, and so on. The Shared teaching's four doors are likewise. For sudden capacities, such as the Distinct and Perfect, each also has its four doors and various kinds—such as the thirty-two bodhisattvas each speaking entry into the gate of non-duality; the various kinds of practice and appearances in the *Avataṃsaka* all address various capacities, bestowing various parables and words to speak the Dharma. "The Buddha-work he does has never been briefly abandoned" is the general conclusion of not-false. As above, the various self-and-other forms and sounds all cause beings to enter the Buddha's knowledge and vision, not the small matters of humans, gods, or the Two Vehicles; therefore it is called "Buddha-work." If only one person attained extinction while others did not, then the Buddha-work would be abandoned; abandonment would cause beings not to obtain true benefit—how could it be that all are truly not false? Why are all truly not false? Formerly it was said, "I sat at the道場 and did not obtain one real dharma." The Seven Expedients are not ultimate extinction; the two nirvāṇas are an expedient empty fist. Therefore one knows that only emptiness was seen, not that all were real. If formerly the seven expedients were bestowed and one still did not enter the one real, one could say it was empty. The empty leads one out; there is no empty exit that does not enter the real. Therefore the former empty is for the real. "All are truly not false" and "Buddha-work is not abandoned"—this is its meaning.**

**「如是我成佛甚大久遠」下，明非滅現滅，又二：初、明非滅現滅，二、從「如來以是方便」下，明現滅利益。初又二：先、明本實不滅，次、從「然今」下，明迹中唱滅。「我成佛已來」下，明果位常，常故不滅，寄此四字明未來大勢威猛常住益物也。從「我本行」下，舉因況果以明常住。舊人據此以證無常云，前過恒沙後倍上數，神通延壽猶是無常。僻取文意大有所失，經舉因況果，果非數也。經云久修業所得壽命無數劫，非神通延壽也。何者？佛修圓因登初住時已得常壽，常壽叵壽已倍上數，況復果耶？云何棄所況之果，苟執能況之因？縱令此因已是於常非無常也。譬如太子時，祿已不可盡，況登尊極，祿用寧可盡乎？明文在茲，何須迴捩疑誤後生耶！「然今非實」下，第二，迹中唱滅。三身並有非滅唱滅義，如《淨名》云「法本不生今則無滅」，即是法身非滅；又云「是寂滅義」，即是唱滅也。何者？若已了達不唱寂滅，為未了者唱耳。若言照寂即是唱滅，若言寂照即是唱生。夫法身者，雖非生非滅亦有生滅，若迷心執著，即煩惱生而智慧滅；若解心無染，即智慧生煩惱滅。滅惑生解此是無常滅，若解生惑滅即是寂滅，此之生滅悉約法性而辨。若無迷解二緣，則不唱有此生滅也。報身非滅唱滅者，誰有智慧誰有煩惱，而言智慧能破，此即明闇不相除，即報身不滅義；眾生未了，聞此便謂其即是佛，而生憍恣不復修道，故復唱言道能滅惑，有煩惱時則無智慧，有智慧時則無煩惱，豈非智慧能滅煩惱耶？應身非滅唱滅者，應是法報之用，體既無滅用豈有窮？即應身不滅，但為眾生若常見佛則生憍恣故，唱我於今夜當取滅度。又法身當體明不滅，報身說不滅必約法身，以理而論，智慧能破為到故破，不到故破為共為獨。如此推理無有能破之功，即智慧不滅惑義；就有智慧則無煩惱，即是慧能滅惑。應身說不滅須約法報，法報常然應用不絕，眾生不盡即不滅度。若法身當體論不生滅，報身了達無能生滅，應身相續不生滅(云云)。從「以是方便教化」下，第二，明現滅益物，又為二：先、不滅眾生有損，二、從「以方便說比丘當知」下，若唱滅者於物有益。初又二：初、不滅有損，次、廣釋不滅。有損者，如前樂小法人，見佛常在，不種善根、貧窮下賤，不生二善故無益；見、思不斷，不斷二惡則是有損。貪著五欲入於憶想，憶想即是見惑；五欲即是思惑也。由此眾生垢重故須唱滅，不唱滅則二惡生而不滅，二善損而不生。若依四悉檀現滅，則二惡滅、二善生，為滅二惡故，用對治、第一義，第一義滅未生惡，對治滅已生惡；世界、為人生二善，世界生未生善，為人生已生善。又世界滅已生惡，對治滅未生惡，如禪五陰滅欲界惡，即是世界滅已生惡，為人生已生善，第一義生未生無為之善。「若見」下，第二，廣釋。若見佛常在，便起憍恣心等故有損，不能生恭敬故無益。「憍恣」即增見惑，「厭怠」即生思惑，「不生難遭想」即不能生見諦解，「不恭敬」即不能生思惟道，為是義故宜應現滅。若見聞三佛不滅，悉有憍恣義，便謂眾生如彌勒如，一如無二如，平等即真，由是生於憍心上慢，謂一切煩惱本自不生，今亦無滅何須修道，即便恣情放逸，為是唱言是寂滅義。又聞一切眾生即菩提相，菩提相即煩惱相，明暗不相除，顯出佛菩提，眾生聞此復起慢恣，不復修善懈怠放逸，為是等故，唱言報身智慧能滅煩惱。無明力大，佛菩提智之所能滅。應身非滅現滅易解。若唱言法本不生今亦不滅，要須滅惑方乃寂滅。經云「智慧不滅煩惱」，然明時無暗，汝今具足煩惱，何能有慧？當知智慧能滅障惑，眾生聞是唱滅，便於三佛生難遭想、起恭敬心。「是故如來以方便」下，明唱滅有益：先、歎佛難值，次、釋難值，三、佛並難值。眾生樂著小法見思障重，聞三身不滅則不修道，難得契會也。「所以」下，釋也。諸薄德人過百千劫，或有見佛或不見者。若見三佛，其人多善少惡，不為其人唱滅，是人見佛常在靈山也；或不見佛，其人障重善輕，為說三身難會，眾生聞之便作是念，三佛雖復非生非滅，必須生善滅惑乃得證見，此事不易，故云「難遭」也。「心懷戀慕渴仰」者，此明現滅無損。滅於見思名無損，種善根名有益。**

**From "Thus it has been an extremely long time since I became Buddha" downward, it clarifies non-extinction manifesting extinction, again in two: first, clarifying non-extinction manifesting extinction; second, from "the Tathāgata by these expedients" downward, clarifying the benefit of manifesting extinction. The first again has two: first, clarifying that the origin is truly not extinguished; second, from "but now it is not real" downward, clarifying the trace-proclamation of extinction. From "since I became Buddha" downward, it clarifies that the fruit-position is constant; since it is constant, it is not extinguished. By these four words it clarifies that in the future, great power and mighty constant abiding benefits beings. From "I originally practiced" downward, it raises the cause to illustrate the fruit in order to clarify constant abiding. The old interpreters took this to prove impermanence, saying that before it surpasses the sands of the Ganges, afterward it doubles the upper number; even a lifespan extended by spiritual powers is still impermanent. This crooked grasp of the text's intent is greatly mistaken. The sutra raises the cause to illustrate the fruit; the fruit is not a number. The sutra says that the life-span obtained by long cultivation of karma is countless kalpas, not a life-span extended by spiritual powers. Why? When the Buddha cultivated the Perfect cause and ascended to the First Abode, he had already obtained constant life. Constant life is beyond life; it already exceeds the upper number--how much more the fruit! How can one abandon the fruit used for illustration and cling to the cause that illustrates? Even if that cause were so, it is already constant, not impermanent. It is like a crown prince: his stipend is already inexhaustible--how much more when he ascends to the utmost rank, would his stipend be exhaustible? The clear text is here; why twist it and mislead later generations? From "but now it is not real" downward, second, it is the trace-proclamation of extinction. The three bodies all have the meaning of non-extinction yet proclaiming extinction. As the *Vimalakīrti* says, "The Dharma is originally not born; now there is no extinction"--this is the Dharma-body's non-extinction; and again it says, "This is the meaning of quiescent extinction"--this is the proclamation of extinction. Why? If one has already fully realized, one does not proclaim quiescent extinction; it is proclaimed for those not yet realized. If one says illumination-quiescence, that is proclaiming extinction; if one says quiescence-illumination, that is proclaiming birth. As for the Dharma-body: though it is neither born nor extinguished, it also has birth and extinction. If the deluded mind clings, afflictions are born and wisdom is extinguished; if the understanding mind is undefiled, wisdom is born and afflictions are extinguished. Extinguishing afflictions and giving rise to understanding--this is impermanent extinction; if understanding is born and afflictions are extinguished, this is quiescent extinction. These births and extinctions are all discriminated in terms of Dharma-nature. If there are no two conditions of delusion and understanding, then one does not proclaim such birth and extinction. As for the reward-body's non-extinction yet proclamation of extinction: who has wisdom, who has afflictions, that one says wisdom can destroy? This is the meaning that light and darkness do not eliminate each other; that is the reward-body's non-extinction. But beings, not yet realized, hearing this, then think they are already Buddha and give rise to arrogance and self-indulgence, no longer cultivating the path. Therefore he again proclaims that the path can destroy afflictions: when there are afflictions there is no wisdom; when there is wisdom there are no afflictions--how is this not wisdom able to destroy afflictions? As for the response-body's non-extinction yet proclamation of extinction: the response is the function of the Dharma and reward; if the substance has no extinction, how could its function be exhausted? That is, the response-body is not extinguished, but because if beings constantly see the Buddha they give rise to arrogance and self-indulgence, he proclaims: "Tonight I will take extinction." Again, the Dharma-body, in its own substance, clearly does not extinguish. The reward-body's not-extinguishing must be explained in relation to the Dharma-body. By principle, to say wisdom can destroy is to say it destroys because it reaches; if it does not reach, its destroying is either common or distinct. Reasoning thus, there is no power that can destroy; this is the meaning that wisdom does not extinguish afflictions. But in terms of having wisdom, there are no afflictions--this is wisdom able to extinguish afflictions. The response-body's not-extinguishing must be explained in relation to Dharma and reward: Dharma and reward are constant, and the response-function is unceasing; when beings are not exhausted, extinction is not taken. If one discusses the Dharma-body in its own substance, it is unborn and unextinguished; the reward-body, having realized, has no one who can be born or extinguished; the response-body continues without being born or extinguished (云云). From "by these expedients he teaches and transforms" downward, second, it clarifies that manifesting extinction benefits beings, again in two: first, not extinguishing is harmful to beings; second, from "by expedient means he says, 'Bhikṣus, you should know'" downward, if he proclaims extinction it is beneficial to beings. The first again has two: first, not extinguishing is harmful; second, broadly explaining not extinguishing. As for harm: as before, those who delight in small dharmas see the Buddha constantly present, do not plant good roots, are poor and lowly, and because they do not produce the two goods, there is no benefit; views and thoughts are not cut off, and if the two evils are not cut off, that is harm. Greed for the five desires enters into recollection; recollection is view-delusion, and the five desires are thought-delusion. Because beings' grime is heavy, it is necessary to proclaim extinction; if extinction is not proclaimed, then the two evils are born and not extinguished, and the two goods are diminished and not produced. If one manifests extinction according to the Four Siddhāntas, then the two evils are extinguished and the two goods are produced. To extinguish the two evils, one uses the Therapeutic and the First Principle: the First Principle extinguishes unarisen evils; the Therapeutic extinguishes already-arisen evils. The Worldly and For-the-Person produce the two goods: the Worldly produces unarisen goods; the For-the-Person produces already-arisen goods. Again, the Worldly extinguishes already-arisen evils; the Therapeutic extinguishes unarisen evils--like the five aggregates of dhyāna extinguishing desire-realm evils, which is the Worldly extinguishing already-arisen evils and the For-the-Person producing already-arisen goods, while the First Principle produces unarisen unconditioned goods. From "if [one] sees" downward, second, it broadly explains. If one sees the Buddha constantly present, then arrogance and self-indulgence arise and thus there is harm; because reverence cannot be produced, there is no benefit. "Arrogance and self-indulgence" increase view-delusion; "laxity and sloth" give rise to thought-delusion; "not giving rise to the thought that [Buddha] is hard to meet" means one cannot produce understanding of the truth of views; "not reverent" means one cannot produce the contemplative path. For these reasons, it is appropriate to manifest extinction. If one sees or hears that the three Buddhas do not extinguish, all will have the meaning of arrogance and self-indulgence, then think that beings are as Maitreya is, one thus, no other thus, equality is truth. From this they give rise to arrogant pride, saying that all afflictions are originally unborn and now also unextinguished--why cultivate the path? They then indulge their passions and become lax. For this reason, he proclaims, "this is the meaning of quiescent extinction." Again, hearing that all beings are the mark of bodhi, and the mark of bodhi is the mark of afflictions, that light and darkness do not eliminate each other, and that Buddha-bodhi is thus revealed, beings hearing this again give rise to pride and self-indulgence, no longer cultivate good, becoming lax and indulgent. For these reasons, he proclaims that reward-body wisdom can extinguish afflictions. The power of ignorance is great; it is what Buddha-bodhi wisdom can extinguish. The response-body's non-extinction manifesting extinction is easily understood. If one proclaims, "The Dharma is originally unborn and now also not extinguished," one must still extinguish afflictions before there is quiescent extinction. The sutra says, "Wisdom does not extinguish afflictions"; but when there is light there is no darkness--if you now fully possess afflictions, how can you have wisdom? Know that wisdom can extinguish obstructing afflictions. When beings hear this proclamation of extinction, they then give rise, with regard to the three Buddhas, to the thought that they are hard to meet, and they arouse reverence. From "therefore the Tathāgata by expedient means" downward, it clarifies that proclaiming extinction has benefit: first, praising the Buddha as difficult to meet; second, explaining why difficult to meet; third, all Buddhas are difficult to meet. Beings delight in small dharmas and have heavy view-and-thought obstructions; if they hear that the three bodies do not extinguish, they will not cultivate the path and will be hard to bring into accord. From "therefore" downward, it explains. People of thin virtue, over a hundred thousand kalpas, may see the Buddha or may not see him. If they see the three Buddhas, such people have much good and little evil, and for such people extinction is not proclaimed; such people see the Buddha constantly on Vulture Peak. If they do not see the Buddha, such people have heavy obstructions and light good; for them it is said that the three bodies are hard to meet. When beings hear this, they think: although the three Buddhas are neither born nor extinguished, one must produce good and extinguish afflictions in order to realize and see--this is not easy, therefore it is said to be "hard to encounter." "With minds full of longing and thirst" clarifies that manifesting extinction is not harmful. Extinguishing view-and-thought is called not harmful; planting good roots is called beneficial.**

**「又善男子」下，第二大段，結三世益物物得實益。又為三：先明諸佛出五濁，必先三後一、先近後遠；次明皆是為化眾生；後明皆非虛妄也。「譬如」下，第二，譬說，有開譬、合譬。開譬為二：一、良醫治子譬，譬上三世應化所宜；二、治子實益譬，譬上三世利物不虛。上未來文少，此中具有。就初為三：一、醫遠行譬，譬過去益物；二、還已復去，譬現在應化；三、尋復來歸，譬未來應化。過去文為二：一、發近顯遠，二、明過去應化所宜。今但譬應化所宜。所宜有三：一、處所，二、拂迹疑，三、正應化，今但譬應化。應化又二：一、機感，二、正應化，今具譬之。「如有良醫」者，超譬上「我以佛眼觀」，有能應之智也。從「多諸子息」，是追譬上「若有眾生來至我所」，能感之機也。上應化所宜又二：一、益物，二、明歡喜，今但譬益物。上益物又二：一、非生現生，二、非滅現滅，今但譬現滅。初「良醫」者，醫有十種：一者治病病增無損，或時致死，譬空見外道，恣意行惡教人起邪斷善根，法身既亡慧命亦死。二者治病不增不損，譬有見苦行外道，投巖赴火苦行行善，不得禪定不能斷結即是無損，亦不能斷善即是不增也。三者治病損而無增，但世醫所治差已還復生，即是修定斷結外道也。四者治病能令差已不復發，而所治不遍，即二乘人止治一兩種有緣者，不能遍治一切也。五者雖能兼遍，而無巧術用治苦痛，《釋論》呼為拙度，即是六度菩薩慈悲廣治也。六、治病妙術，治無痛惱而不能治必死之人，譬通教菩薩體法，但治有反復凡夫，不治焦種二乘也。七、雖治難愈之病，而不一時治一切病，即是別教菩薩也。八、能一時治一切病，而不能令平復如本，即圓教初心十信也。九、能遍治一切，亦能平復如本，而不能令過本，即圓教後心也。十、一時治一切病即能平復，又使過本，即是如來。前三種醫即《大經》中之舊醫用乳藥也；後七並客醫，無術者，但用無常苦等法，如用辛苦酢藥也，有術遠來還令服乳，最後究竟良醫也。良者善也，內有三達五眼即是八術。妙得藥性善治者，外識病源能用藥也。「智慧」者，權實二智，深知二諦也。「聰達」者，五眼鑒機頓漸不差也。十二部教文理甚深，如「明鍊方藥」，依四悉檀治眾生病，如「善治眾病」也。《無量義》云「醫王大醫王」，以大醫故稱為良醫。「多諸子息」，「若十」，聲聞；「二十」，支佛；「百數」，菩薩。菩薩之子，凡有三種子義：一、就一切眾生，皆有三種性德，佛性即是佛子，故云「其中眾生悉是吾子」，此文云「多諸子息」也。約十心數法即有百子，心王為正因佛性，慧是了因性，餘九相扶起屬緣因性，一數起時九數扶助，如是成百也。性德佛子非善非惡而通善惡，故此十數及與心王為通心數，是以性德三因，悉屬正因佛子。二者就昔結緣為佛子，如十六王子覆講《法華》，時聞法者亦生微解，即成了因性；昔微能修行，為緣因性；正性為本，此三因並屬緣因，資發今日一實之解，故以昔日結緣，為緣因佛子，即火宅中三十子也。此約十信，一信起時即具餘九，還有百信，故得結緣為佛子也。三者了因之子，即是今日聞《法華經》，安住實智中，我定當作佛，決了聲聞法，是諸經之王，從佛口生、得佛法分，故名真子。此亦有三因性，今既顯了見於佛性，並屬了因佛子；百子之義還將十數入十善法中，十信入初住中，是故正因通於本末。此文明百子，不取了因子，了因子屬下不失心服藥中明之。「以有事緣遠至他國」者，譬過去應化中現滅也。「諸子於後」下，第二，還已復去，譬現世益物，又二：一、諸子於後飲毒，譬上機應相關，見諸眾生德薄垢重，眾生於佛滅後，樂著三界邪師之法，故云「飲他毒藥」，即是「遊行詣他國」，輪轉諸趣墮在三界，故云「宛轉于地」。「是時其父還來歸家」下，譬上我少出家得三菩提第二非生現生也。上有二，形聲及利益不虛，今言諸子飲毒去譬上形益，信受邪師之法名為「飲毒」，「失心」是無大小機感生，不失心是有大小機感生。又失心者，貪著三界，失先所種三乘善根也，為是人非滅唱滅。不失心者，雖著五欲而不失三乘善根，為是人故非生現生，善強惡輕見佛即能修道斷結，如子見父求藥病愈；善輕惡重得見佛，亦求護而不修道，如子見父求救不肯服藥，父為此子唱言應死。「遙見」者，明佛出世時眾生亦見色身，而為見、思障隔五分，不得親奉法身，故云「遙」也。見聞佛出皆有喜敬之事，現諸經文梵王請等，例是求救之辭也。「父見子等苦」下，譬上聲益，又二：初譬佛受請轉二諦法輪也。「而作是言」下，譬誡勸。「經方」者，即十二部教也，「藥草」即教所詮八萬法門也。從佛出十二部乃至出《涅槃》，此出漸頓藥草也。直從佛出十二部，此出頓藥草也；從佛出修多羅，此出漸藥草也。「色」者譬戒，戒防身口事相彰顯也。「香」者譬定，功德香熏一切也。「味」者譬慧，能得理味也。此戒定慧即八正道，修八正道能見佛性。又「色」是般若，照了法性之色分明無礙；「香」是解脫，斷德離臭也；「味」是法身，理味也。三法不縱不橫名祕密藏，依教修行得入此藏也。說三乘空三昧力如「擣」、無相如「篩」、無作如「合」，一一三昧具戒定慧也。又空觀如「擣」、假觀如「篩」、中觀如「合」，此三觀各不離戒定慧。將此法與漸頓眾生令修行，名「服」也。從「而作是言」乃至「可服」，即是勸門也。從「速除苦惱」乃至「無復眾患」，即是誡門也。將誡勸二教，令諸眾生服法藥也。「其諸子中不失心者」下，譬上得益不虛。上有二：一、不虛，次、釋不虛，今云「其諸子中不失心者服藥病差」，即譬上皆實不虛也。釋不虛，不作譬也。**

**From "Again, good sons" downward, the second major section concludes that beings in the three times obtain real benefit. Again it has three parts: first, it clarifies that all Buddhas who appear in the five turbidities must first teach three then one, first near then far; second, it clarifies that all is for transforming beings; third, it clarifies that all is not false. From "for example" downward, second, the parable-explanation: it has an opening parable and a matching parable. The opening parable has two: (1) the parable of a good physician healing his sons, corresponding to the above suitability of response-transformation in the three times; (2) the parable of the sons' real benefit, corresponding to the above three-times benefiting of beings that is not false. Above, the future text was brief; here it is all included. The first has three: (1) the physician's distant travel, a parable of past benefit; (2) returning and then going again, a parable of present response-transformation; (3) returning again, a parable of future response-transformation. The past portion has two: (1) opening the near and revealing the far, (2) clarifying what is appropriate for past response-transformation; here it only parables what is appropriate for response-transformation. The appropriate has three: place, dispelling trace doubts, and proper response-transformation; here it only parables response-transformation. Response-transformation again has two: capacity-response and proper response-transformation; here both are parabled. "As if there were a good physician" goes beyond the earlier parable "I observe with the Buddha-eye"; it is the wisdom able to respond. From "having many sons" it retroactively parables "if there are beings who come to me"; it is the capacities that can respond. Above, the suitability of response-transformation again had two: benefiting beings and clarifying rejoicing; here it only parables benefiting beings. Above, benefiting beings again had two: non-birth manifesting birth, and non-extinction manifesting extinction; here it only parables manifesting extinction. First, as for "good physician": physicians are of ten kinds. First, one whose treatment increases illness without benefit, sometimes even causing death--this is like nihilistic non-Buddhists who indulge in evil and teach others to give rise to perverse views that cut off good roots; when the Dharma-body is lost, the wisdom-life also dies. Second, one whose treatment neither increases nor decreases--this is like the eternalist ascetic outsiders who throw themselves off cliffs and into fires, practicing austerities and good deeds but attaining no dhyāna and cutting no fetters; this is no decrease, and they also cannot cut off good, which is no increase. Third, one whose treatment decreases but does not increase; worldly doctors cure but the illness returns--this is the outsiders who cultivate concentration and cut fetters. Fourth, one whose treatment can cure so that it does not recur, but what is treated is not all-pervasive--this is the Two Vehicles who only treat one or two kinds of those with affinities, unable to treat all. Fifth, one who can treat both and pervade, yet lacks skillful technique and treats with pain; the *Great Treatise* calls this "clumsy deliverance"; this is the bodhisattva of the Six Pāramitās who compassionately treats broadly. Sixth, one with subtle medical skill, who treats without pain and distress yet cannot treat those who must die--this is the Shared Teaching bodhisattva contemplating dharmas' substance, who only treats ordinary people who can revert, not the burnt-seed Two Vehicles. Seventh, one who can treat difficult-to-cure illnesses, yet cannot treat all illnesses at once--this is the Distinct Teaching bodhisattva. Eighth, one who can treat all illnesses at once, yet cannot restore to the original condition--this is the Perfect Teaching initial mind of the Ten Faiths. Ninth, one who can universally treat all, and can restore to the original condition, yet cannot make it surpass the original--this is the Perfect Teaching later mind. Tenth, one who can treat all illnesses at once and restore, and also make it surpass the original--this is the Tathāgata. The first three kinds of physicians are the old physicians in the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* who use milk medicine; the latter seven are guest physicians. Those without skill only use impermanence, suffering, and the like, like using pungent, bitter, and sour medicines; those with skill come from afar and again have them take milk--the last is the ultimate good physician. "Good" means skillful: inwardly, having the three penetrations and five eyes is the eight arts. "Wonderfully obtaining the nature of medicines and being good at healing" means outwardly recognizing the source of illness and being able to use medicine. "Wisdom" means the two wisdoms of provisional and real, deeply knowing the two truths. "Quick understanding" means the five eyes discerning capacities, sudden and gradual, without error. The doctrines and principles of the twelve divisions are very deep, like "clearly refining prescriptions and medicines"; relying on the Four Siddhāntas to cure beings' illnesses is like "well treating all illnesses." The *Sūtra of Immeasurable Meanings* says "Physician-King, Great Physician-King"; because of being a great physician, he is called a good physician. "Many sons": "if ten" means śrāvakas; "twenty" means pratyekabuddhas; "a hundred" means bodhisattvas. As for the sons of bodhisattvas, there are three kinds of meaning. First, with respect to all beings: all have three kinds of inherent virtue; Buddha-nature is precisely Buddha-child. Therefore it says, "all beings among them are my children"; this text says "many sons." In terms of the ten mental factors there are a hundred sons: the mind-king is the proper-cause Buddha-nature; wisdom is the understanding-cause nature; the remaining nine, mutually supporting and arising, belong to the condition-cause nature. When one factor arises, nine factors support it, thus making a hundred. The inherent-virtue Buddha-child is neither good nor evil and yet includes good and evil; therefore these ten factors and the mind-king are common mental factors, and thus the three causes of inherent virtue all belong to the proper-cause Buddha-child. Second, those who in the past formed affinities as Buddha-children: such as the sixteen princes who re-expounded the *Lotus*; those who heard the Dharma then produced slight understanding, thus becoming understanding-cause nature; in the past they could slightly cultivate practice, thus becoming condition-cause nature; the proper nature is the root. These three causes all belong to the condition-cause, supporting and giving rise to today's one-real understanding; therefore, because of past affinities, they are condition-cause Buddha-children--namely, the thirty children in the burning house. This is in terms of the Ten Faiths: when one faith arises, it already includes the other nine; there are again a hundred faiths, thus enabling the formation of affinities as Buddha-children. Third, the child of understanding-cause: these are those who today hear the *Lotus Sutra*, abide in real wisdom, and say, "I will certainly become Buddha"; they decisively understand the śrāvaka Dharma. This is the king of sutras, born from the Buddha's mouth, receiving a share of the Buddha's Dharma, therefore called true children. This too has the three cause-natures. Now that they clearly see Buddha-nature, they all belong to the understanding-cause Buddha-children. The meaning of "hundred sons" again brings the ten factors into the ten wholesome dharmas, the Ten Faiths into the First Abode; therefore the proper cause permeates root and branch. This text clarifies the hundred sons and does not take the understanding-cause sons; the understanding-cause sons belong below, in the section on not losing one's mind and taking the medicine. "Because of some affair, [he] traveled far to another country" parables the past response-transformation's manifesting extinction. From "afterward, the sons..." downward, second: returning and then going again, a parable of present-world benefit, again in two. First: "afterward the sons drank poison" parables the correlation of capacity and response above, seeing that beings have thin virtue and heavy grime. After the Buddha's extinction, beings delight in the dharmas of heterodox teachers in the three realms; therefore it says "they drank another's poison" --this is "traveling and going to another country," revolving through the destinies and falling in the three realms, therefore it says "rolling about on the ground." From "then their father returned home" downward, it parables above: I in my youth left home and attained the three bodhis, second, non-birth manifesting birth. Above there are two: form-and-sound and benefit not false. Now it says the sons drank poison and left, parabling the form benefit above. Trusting and accepting the dharmas of heterodox teachers is named "drinking poison." "Losing their minds" means there is no response-capacity of great or small; not losing their minds means there is response-capacity of great or small. Again, those who lose their minds are greedy for the three realms and lose the previously planted good roots of the three vehicles; for such people he proclaims extinction though not extinguished. Those who do not lose their minds, though attached to the five desires, do not lose the good roots of the three vehicles; for such people he manifests birth though unborn. The good are strong and the evil light; seeing the Buddha they can cultivate the path and cut fetters, like sons who see their father and seek medicine and are cured. Those with light good and heavy evil, though they see the Buddha, also seek protection but do not cultivate the path, like sons who see their father and seek rescue yet refuse to take the medicine; for such sons the father proclaims that they should die. "Seeing from afar" means: when the Buddha appears in the world, beings also see the form body, but because of the five portions obstructed by view and thought, they cannot personally attend the Dharma-body; therefore it says "from afar." Seeing and hearing the Buddha's appearance all involves joy and reverence; in the sutras the Brahmā King's request and the like are exemplars of words seeking rescue. From "the father, seeing the sons' suffering" downward, it parables the sound benefit above, again in two. First, it parables the Buddha accepting the request and turning the Dharma wheel of the two truths. From "and he said thus" downward, it parables admonition and exhortation. "Prescriptions" are the twelve divisions of teaching; "medicinal herbs" are the eighty-four thousand Dharma-gates that the teachings expound. From the Buddha's teaching of the twelve divisions up to teaching the *Nirvāṇa*, this brings forth the gradual and sudden medicinal herbs. Directly bringing forth the twelve divisions from the Buddha brings forth the sudden medicinal herbs; bringing forth the sūtras from the Buddha brings forth the gradual medicinal herbs. "Color" parables precepts: precepts guard bodily and verbal conduct and make characteristics manifest. "Fragrance" parables concentration: the fragrance of merit perfumes all. "Taste" parables wisdom: it can obtain the taste of principle. These precepts, concentration, and wisdom are the Noble Eightfold Path; cultivating the Eightfold Path can reveal Buddha-nature. Again, "color" is prajñā, illuminating the color of Dharma-nature clearly and without obstruction; "fragrance" is liberation, the virtue of cutting off and leaving stench; "taste" is the Dharma-body, the taste of principle. The three dharmas are neither vertical nor horizontal and are called the Secret Treasury; relying on the teaching to cultivate practice one enters this treasury. Explaining the three-vehicle emptiness samādhi: its power is like "pounding"; the signless is like "sifting"; the wishless is like "combining" --each samādhi possesses precepts, concentration, and wisdom. Again, contemplation of emptiness is like "pounding"; contemplation of the provisional is like "sifting"; contemplation of the middle is like "combining"; these three contemplations each do not depart from precepts, concentration, and wisdom. Taking this Dharma and having gradual and sudden beings cultivate it is called "taking [the medicine]." From "and he said thus" through "can be taken" is the gate of exhortation. From "quickly remove suffering and vexation" through "no longer many troubles" is the gate of admonition. Taking the two teachings of admonition and exhortation, he causes beings to take the Dharma-medicine. From "among the sons, those who did not lose their minds" downward, it parables above that the benefit is not false. Above it had two: (1) not false, (2) explaining not false. Now it says "among the sons, those who did not lose their minds took the medicine and their illness was cured" --this parables that above all is truly not false. The explanation of not-false does not use a parable.**
