## V. THE FIVE CORRUPTIONS (Lines 240-255; CBETA 004:240–255)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
從「十方尚無二乘，何況有三」者，是第三、舉五濁釋開權也。將舉五濁，先標其意，上已說諸佛開權顯實，未明隱實施權，其法清淨湛一如空，尚無帶二、帶三之權，況有單三、單五之權？

<div class="english-translation">
From the line **"In the Ten Directions there are not even Two Vehicles, how much less are there Three"** is the **Third Part: Raising the Five Corruptions to explain Opening the Provisional.**<br>
Before raising the Five Corruptions, he first marks out the intention.<br>
Above, it already explained that all Buddhas Open the Provisional and Reveal the Real. It did not yet clarify **Hiding the Real to Implement the Provisional** (*Yǐn Shí Shī Quán*).<br>
The Dharma is pure, deeply One like Space. There is not even the "Provisional containing Two" or "Provisional containing Three"—how much less could there be the "Provisional of the Single Three" or "Single Five"?[^1]<br>

<div class="chinese-source">
[5]秖為五濁障重實不得宣，須施單五、單三之權，亦施帶二、帶三之權，故言「於一佛乘分別說三」，分別說於若帶二、帶三之三，若單五、單三之三也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
It is only because the **Five Corruptions** are heavy obstacles that the Real cannot be proclaimed.<br>
Thus, one must implement the Provisional of the **Single Five** [Human/Heavenly Vehicle] and **Single Three** [Tripiṭaka].<br>
One also implements the Provisional of the **Containing Two** [Shared Teaching] and **Containing Three** [Distinct Teaching].<br>
Therefore it says: **"Within the One Buddha Vehicle, distinguishingly speaking Three."**<br>
"Distinguishing" means speaking of the "Three" that contains Two/Three, or the "Three" of the Single Five/Single Three.

### Definitions of the Five Corruptions

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「五濁」者，自有四別：初、唱數，二、列名，三、體相，四、釋結。唱數、列名如文。「如是」者，明體相也。劫濁無別體，劫是長時，剎那是短時，但約四濁立此假名，文云「劫濁亂時」，即此義也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Regarding the **Five Corruptions** (*Wǔ Zhuó*), there are four distinctions:<br>
1.  Chanting the Number.<br>
2.  Listing the Names.<br>
3.  Substance and Marks (*Tǐ Xiàng*).<br>
4.  Explanation and Conclusion.<br>
"Chanting the number" and "Listing the names" are as in the text.<br>
**[Sutra Text]: "Thus." (*Rúshì*)** clarifies the Substance and Marks.<br>
1.  **Corruption of the Kalpa (*Jié Zhuó*):** It has no separate substance. "Kalpa" is a long time; "Kṣaṇa" is a short time. This false name is established only with regard to the [other] Four Corruptions.<br>
The text says "The time when the Corruption of the Kalpa is chaotic/disordered"—this is the meaning.

<div class="english-translation">
2.  **Corruption of Living Beings (*Zhòngshēng Zhuó*):** This also has no separate substance. It establishes this false name based on **Views** (*Jiàn*) and **Pride** (*Màn*) upon the Retribution (*Guǒbào*) [of the Aggregates].<br>
The text says "Living Beings are heavy with filth"—this is the meaning.

3.  **Corruption of Afflictions:** Points to the **Five Dull Drivers** (*Wǔ Dùn Shǐ*) as its substance.<br>
4.  **Corruption of Views:** Points to the **Five Sharp Drivers** (*Wǔ Lì Shǐ*) as its substance.<br>
5.  **Corruption of Life-span:** Points to the **Connecting and Holding of Form and Mind** (*Liánchí Sè Xīn*) as its substance.

相者，四濁增劇聚在此時，瞋恚增劇刀兵起，貪欲增劇飢餓起，愚癡增劇疾疫起，三災起故煩惱倍隆、諸見轉熾，麁弊色心惡名穢稱，摧年減壽眾濁交湊，如水奔昏風波鼓努魚龍攪撓，無一憀賴時使之然。

Regarding the **Marks** (*Xiàng*):<br>
The Four Corruptions increase and intensify, gathering in this time.<br>

*   When **Greed** increases intensely, the [Disaster of] Famine arises.<br>
*   When **Ignorance** increases intensely, the [Disaster of] Pestilence arises.<br>
Because the Three Disasters arise, Afflictions doubly flourish, and Views turn blazing.<br>
Coarse and vile Form and Mind, evil names and filthy designations, destroying years and reducing lifespan—the Multitude of Corruptions gather together (*jiāocòu*).<br>

For example: at the beginning of a kalpa, the Light-Sound Heaven beings fall to the earth and the earth causes desire; like the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven beings entering a coarse and rough garden, the garden gives rise to fighting-minds—this is called the mark of kalpa-corruption. As for afflictions-corruption: the sea of greed receives streams and is never sated; the venomous serpent of anger absorbs poison and vexes the world; the darkness of ignorance is more stubborn than lacquer and ink; pride looks down from on high with no limit; the net of doubt has no faith and cannot be told the truth—these are the marks of afflictions-corruption. As for views-corruption: taking “no person” as “there is a person,” taking “there is a path” as “there is no path,” the sixteen views and sixty-two, etc., are like a net and like a dense forest—binding and twisting so one cannot escape—these are the marks of views-corruption. As for beings-corruption: grasping form and mind and establishing a single “controller,” like sticky glue that does not fail to adhere to anything; drifting through the six destinies, receiving birth everywhere; like poverty and shortness being named long and rich—these are the marks of beings-corruption. As for life-corruption: born in the morning, dying at dusk; emerging by day, sinking by evening; like waves turning and smoke circling, instant by instant not abiding—these are the marks of life-corruption. The marks of corruption are many and cannot be fully described. As for their sequence: afflictions and views are the root; from these two corruptions beings are formed; from beings there is the linking-and-holding of life; these four, passing through time, are called kalpa-corruption.

### Q&A: Hearing the Great in Avataṃsaka Before Removing Turbidities? (Lines 242-248; CBETA 004:242–248)

<div class="bilingual-row">

問：五濁若障大，《華嚴》中未除濁而聞法者，何也？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Question:** If the five corruptions obstruct the Great [Vehicle], why in the *Avataṃsaka* are there those who, without having removed the corruptions, nevertheless hear the Dharma?

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
答：此應四句分別：一、大乘根利障重，以根利故重障不能障，此土《華嚴》初聞大乘者是也；二、根利障輕；三、根鈍障輕，他方淨土聞大乘者是也；四、根鈍障重，如此土身子流輩，除濁方聞大乘者是也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Answer:** This should be distinguished by four phrases: (1) Mahāyāna roots sharp, obscuration heavy—because the roots are sharp, heavy obscurations cannot obstruct; these are those in this world who first heard the Mahāyāna in the *Avataṃsaka*; (2) roots sharp, obscuration light; (3) roots dull, obscuration light—those in the pure lands of other directions who hear the Mahāyāna; (4) roots dull, obscuration heavy—those like Śāriputra and his cohort in this world, who only after removing the corruptions then hear the Mahāyāna.

<div class="english-translation">
**Answer:** Regarding the Small Vehicle, one should distinguish **Four Phrases** (*Sì Jù*):<br>
1.  **Roots Keen, Obscuration Light:** The Obstacle cannot obstruct. Example: **Śāriputra**.<br>
2.  **Roots Keen, Obscuration Heavy:** The Obstacle also cannot obstruct. Example: **Aṅgulimāla** (*Yāngjué*, the serial killer).<br>
3.  **Roots Dull, Obscuration Light:** Also not obstructed. Example: **Cūḍapanthaka** (*Pántè*, who couldn't memorize a verse).<br>
4.  **Roots Dull, Obscuration Heavy:** This then forms an obstacle; they do not hear the Small Vehicle and do not obtain deliverance.

### Q&A: Hearing the Great Outside the Teachings? (Lines 260-266; CBETA 004:260–266)

<div class="chinese-source">
問：自有不在《華嚴》，不在三藏而得聞大、聞小乘者，何也？

<div class="english-translation">
**Question:** There are those who are not present at the *Avataṃsaka* and not present at the *Tripiṭaka* [assemblies], yet obtain the hearing of the Great or Small Vehicles. Why is this?
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
答：此就四教，教教中作四門分別。根利遮輕者，聞非空非有門入也；根利遮重者，聞亦空亦有門入也；根鈍遮輕者，聞空門入也；根鈍遮重者，聞有門入也。兩教四門，約小乘分別，兩教四門，約大乘分別，細推可解(云云)。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Answer:** This depends on the Four Teachings. Within each Teaching, one makes a distinction of **Four Gates**.<br>
*   **Roots Keen / Obscuration Light:** They enter by hearing the **Neither-Empty-Nor-Existing Gate**.<br>
*   **Roots Keen / Obscuration Heavy:** They enter by hearing the **Both-Empty-And-Existing Gate**.<br>
*   **Roots Dull / Obscuration Light:** They enter by hearing the **Empty Gate**.<br>
*   **Roots Dull / Obscuration Heavy:** They enter by hearing the **Existing Gate**.<br>

### Why Corruptions Obstruct Great but Not Small (Lines 268-274; CBETA 004:268–274)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
問：五濁一往何故障大而不障小？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Question:** Generally speaking, why do the Five Corruptions obstruct the Great but not the Small?
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
答：眾生濁重，妄計五陰為四德，若聞常我即執非為是，舊醫頑騃不知乳之好惡，不知病起根源，不知藥餌開遮，無所知曉故濁障大也。文云：「我若讚佛乘，眾生沒在苦」，即此義也。若聞無常、苦、空，即厭生死、欣涅槃，破其[2]邪計[3]執，故五濁不障小，文云：「[4]作是思惟時，十方佛皆現，梵音慰喻我」，即此義也。約五濁論四悉檀者，劫、命是世界，眾生、見是為人，煩惱是對治，用三悉檀除其五濁，後為說大第一義悉檀也。若論因果則二因三果，一人四法，四法一時，二報障、二煩惱障，業在其間，眾生是因成假，命是相續假，相待假可知。眾生是受假，四是法假，名假通兩處，煩惱、見在凡夫，餘三通凡聖。命短、劫長，餘三通長短。劫但是時，命帶法論時。劫通內外，命但在內。三小害人、不害物，三大害物、不害人。小劫但在人，大劫通色界，命通五道、三界。劫是共濁，四各各濁，小劫是劫濁，大劫通濁不濁，從八萬至十歲為小劫，八十反為大劫也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Answer:** The corruption of sentient beings is heavy: they falsely calculate the five aggregates to be the four virtues. If they hear [the Mahāyāna] “permanence” and “self,” they grasp what is not [true] as true. It is like an old doctor facing stubborn fools: they do not know whether milk is good or bad; they do not know the root-source of the illness; they do not know which medicines should be opened or blocked. Having no understanding at all, the corruptions obstruct the Great. The text says: “If I were to praise the Buddha Vehicle, sentient beings would sink into suffering”—this is the meaning.<br><br>
If they hear impermanence, suffering, and emptiness, then they loathe saṃsāra and delight in nirvāṇa, breaking their evil calculations and attachments; therefore the five corruptions do not obstruct the Small. The text says: “When I made this reflection, the Buddhas of the ten directions all appeared; with Brahma voice they comforted me”—this is the meaning.<br><br>
Discussing the four siddhāntas in terms of the five corruptions: kalpa and lifespan are the worldly; sentient beings and views are for-the-person; afflictions are therapeutic. By using the three siddhāntas, one removes the five corruptions; afterward, for their sake, one speaks the Great first-principle siddhānta.<br><br>
If one discusses cause and fruit: there are two causes and three fruits; one person and four dharmas; the four dharmas in one time; two retribution obstructions and two affliction obstructions, with karma between them. Sentient beings are the cause-constructed provisional; lifespan is the continuity provisional; and the mutual-dependence provisional can be understood. Sentient beings are the receiving provisional; the four are dharma-provisional; the name-provisional spans both places. Afflictions and views are in ordinary beings; the other three span ordinary and sages. Lifespan is short; kalpa is long; the other three span long and short. Kalpa is only time; lifespan discusses time together with dharmas. Kalpa spans inner and outer; lifespan is only inner. The three small disasters harm persons and do not harm things; the three great disasters harm things and do not harm persons. The small kalpa pertains only to persons; the great kalpa spans the form realm. Lifespan spans the five destinies and the three realms. Kalpa is a shared corruption; the other four are each individual corruptions. The small kalpa is kalpa-corruption; the great kalpa spans corrupted and uncorrupted. From eighty thousand down to ten years is a small kalpa; eighty [years] in reverse is a great kalpa.

From the line **"If my disciples call themselves."** onward is the **Fourth Part: Discriminating the False and Urging the True** (*Jiǎn wěi dūn zhēn*).<br>
If one is a Buddha’s disciple, one should naturally be able to believe and understand. If one does not believe and understand, one is not a true disciple and also not an arhat—this is to press the assembly of the time, causing them to believe, accept, and understand.<br>

This **Discriminating** again has two parts:<br>

2. If they hear but do not believe and accept, they become **overweening pride** (*Zēngshàngmàn*).<br><br>
It is like worldly disciples: they comply with their teacher’s dharma and inherit the transmission of the lamp. If they have not heard and do not know, then there is no dharma they can comply with—how could they be called “disciples”?<br>
The Tathāgata formerly spoke of the five corruptions and opened the three. You complied and attained nirvāṇa; you obtained hearing and obtained knowing—thus you were named “disciples.”<br>
Now that the five corruptions have already been removed, he speaks the One for your sake—why would you not hear and not know?

Next, from **"Also, Śāriputra."** onward, the second [subsection] clarifies that **not believing** becomes overweening pride—this is to press them so that they believe.<br>
Why?<br>
You yourself say you are in the **final body**, yet the body is still immeasurable—truly, it is not the final body.<br>
You yourself say you are **ultimate**, yet there remain two hundred yojanas—truly, it is not ultimate.<br>

Next, from **"Why is this? After the Buddha’s extinction."** onward, he clarifies that good people are hard to obtain and deep sūtras are hard to understand—this also does not constitute overweening pride.<br>
If the Buddha is in the world and is directly preaching this sūtra, then not believing and not accepting means one is not a true arhat and becomes overweening pride. If, after the Buddha’s extinction, one only then attains arhatship: clinging one-sidedly to provisional sūtras and not believing the Perfect Dharma is permitted as **not** being overweening pride.<br>
Moreover, though the Buddha has entered extinction, this sūtra still remains—if one does not believe and does not accept, should that be overweening pride? Here too he can open the exception: after the Buddha’s extinction, though this sūtra exists, those who can explain its words and meaning are hard to encounter; thus the arhat does not believe and does not understand, and it is again permitted as not being overweening pride.<br>
Next, he resolves doubt: if after the Buddha’s extinction, those who can explain the sūtra are hard to meet, then will those who attain arhatship **enter nirvāṇa forever**?

即釋云，是人雖生滅度之想，捨命已後便生界外有餘之國，值遇餘佛得聞此經，即便決了。《釋論》第九十三釋〈畢定品〉云：「羅漢受先世身，身必應滅，住在何處而具足佛道？答：『羅漢三界漏因緣盡，更不復生三界，出三界外有淨佛土，無煩惱名，於是國土佛所，聞《法華經》具足佛道。』」即引《法華》云：「有羅漢若不聞《法華》，自謂得滅度，我於餘國為說是事，汝皆作佛。」《論》既引經為證，今釋經還[1]將《論》解。

<div class="english-translation">
He immediately explains, saying: Although this person gives rise to the thought of extinction, after casting off this life, he is then born in a **Land-with-Remainder outside the realm**; meeting another Buddha and hearing this sūtra, he immediately resolves it [i.e., becomes decisive/clear].<br>
The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra* (Fascicle 93), explaining the **"Certainty Chapter"** (畢定品), says:<br>
**Question:** An arhat receives a body from past-life causes; that body must certainly be extinguished—where does he abide and yet fulfill the Buddha Way?<br>
**Answer:** “An arhat’s causal conditions for outflows in the Three Realms are exhausted; he is not again born in the Three Realms. Outside the Three Realms there is a pure Buddha-land, called ‘No Afflictions.’ In that land, at that Buddha’s place, he hears the *Lotus Sūtra* and fulfills the Buddha Way.”<br><br>
It then cites the *Lotus* and says: “If there is an arhat who has not heard the *Lotus*, he calls himself as having attained extinction. In other lands I speak of this matter; you will all become Buddhas.”<br>
Since the treatise cites the sūtra as proof, here in explaining the sūtra we in turn use the treatise to interpret it.

南岳師云：「餘佛者，四依也，羅漢遇之聞經決了。又羅漢修念佛定見十方佛，為說此經便得決了。又凡夫行人，苦到懺悔見十方佛為說，亦得決了。」瑤師云：「實羅漢必自知《法華》志求於大，利根則自知，中、下根須聞而知，故言聞知。何容於佛滅後不聞《法華》？或聞而不信，遇餘佛方解耶？末法凡夫猶尚能信，況聖人乎？除佛滅後者，指凡夫也。」有人言：「凡夫未證法相，所見不明、執心不固，所以易信；羅漢證法相，所見分明、執心牢固，忽聞異說未便信受，故云不信，其義必然。故身子云：『將非魔作佛惱亂我心耶？』」若從此義，指羅漢不指凡夫(云云)。此直異解，不用此義也。

<div class="english-translation">
Master Nányuè says: “The ‘other Buddha’ means the **Four Reliances**. The arhat meets them, hears the sūtra, and becomes decisive/clear. Further, the arhat cultivates the *Buddha-recollection samādhi* and sees the Buddhas of the ten directions; when they speak this sūtra for him, he then becomes decisive/clear. Further, an ordinary practitioner, when suffering drives him to repentance, sees the Buddhas of the ten directions speaking [it], and likewise becomes decisive/clear.”<br><br>
Master Yáo says: “A true arhat must himself know that the *Lotus* sets his will on seeking the Great. If his roots are sharp, he knows on his own; those with middling or dull roots must hear and then know—therefore it says ‘hear/know.’ How could it be that after the Buddha’s extinction he does not hear the *Lotus*? Or that he hears but does not believe, and only upon meeting another Buddha does he then understand? Ordinary beings in the Final Dharma age can still believe—how much more should a sage! ‘Except after the Buddha’s extinction’ points to ordinary beings.”<br><br>
Someone says: “Ordinary beings have not yet realized the dharma-characteristics; what they see is unclear and their grasping-mind is not firm, therefore they easily believe. Arhats have realized the dharma-characteristics; what they see is clear and their grasping-mind is firm. When they suddenly hear a different teaching, they do not immediately believe and accept; therefore it says they do not believe—this meaning must be so. Thus Śāriputra says: ‘Could it be that Māra has become a Buddha to trouble my mind?’” If one follows this meaning, it points to arhats and not to ordinary beings (etc.).<br>
This is simply a different interpretation; we do not use this meaning.

## VI. EXPLANATION OF THE VERSES (Lines 299-331; CBETA 004:299–331)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「舍利弗」下，第五，明無虛妄者，止物謗心。此為三：初、勸信釋迦實說，故云：「汝等當一心信解、受持佛語。」次、勸信諸佛，故云：「諸佛言無虛妄」，諸佛道同，彌加信受。後結成不虛，故[2]云：「無[3]有餘乘，唯一佛乘」也。

<div class="english-translation">
From **"Śāriputra."** onward, the **Fifth** [meaning] clarifies **No Falsehood** (*Wú xūwàng*): it stops beings from harboring a mind of slander.<br>
This has three parts:<br>
First, he exhorts faith that **Śākyamuni truly speaks**, hence it says: “You should single-mindedly believe and understand, and uphold the Buddha’s words.”<br>
Second, he exhorts faith in **all Buddhas**, hence it says: “The Buddhas say there is no falsehood.” The Buddhas’ path is the same; all the more one should believe and accept.<br>
Finally, he concludes it as not false; therefore it says: “There is no other vehicle—there is only the One Buddha Vehicle.”

In the above “permission to answer” there are three: namely, **following**, **admonishing**, and **discriminating**. Here the verse does not verse the “following,” but only verses the discriminating and admonishing.<br>
The “discriminating [the] assembly” is [set] as two: first, three and a half lines verse the earlier “five thousand withdrew”; next, two phrases verse the earlier “the assembly has already become pure”; next, one phrase verses the admonition to listen.<br>
Overweening pride and self-pride, and not believing, are found throughout the fourfold assembly. Yet among the two monastic assemblies, many cultivate the path and attain meditative absorption and mistakenly claim the noble fruit—thus overweening pride tends to arise. Among the laity, many vaunt themselves and thus self-pride often arises. Women, having shallow wisdom, often give rise to deviant and perverse [views/behaviors].[^2]

### 2. Verse/Prose Structure of the Correct Answer (CBETA 004:308–315)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
從「諸佛所得法」下，有一百十六行三句，頌上正答也，又為二：初、從「諸佛所得法」下，有七十三行一句，頌四佛章門；從「今我亦如是」下，有四十三行半，頌上釋迦章門。就初又為四：初、諸佛所得下，三十四行三句，頌上諸佛門；從「過去無數劫」下，第二，有二十七行半，頌過去佛門；從「未來諸世尊」下，第三，有六行半，頌未來佛門；從「天人所供養」下，第四，有四行半，頌現在佛門。今就初頌諸佛門中，與長行凡有三異：一、彼此互無，二、前後間出，三、開合不同。上有歎法希有而無五濁，頌有五濁而無歎法。上先歎法，次明不虛，開權顯實；今先開權顯實，後明不虛。上勸信與不虛合說，今分勸信隔於不虛也。私謂上以釋迦方便，釋成諸佛之權，偈中以釋迦之實，釋成諸佛顯一，是四異也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
From **“The dharma obtained by the Buddhas”** onward, there are 116 lines and three phrases, versing the above “correct answer.” It is again divided into two: first, from “The dharma obtained by the Buddhas” onward there are 73 lines and one phrase, versing the gate of the Four-Buddhas chapter; from “Now I too am thus” onward there are 43 and a half lines, versing the gate of the Śākyamuni chapter.<br>
Within the first, there are again four: (1) from “The dharma obtained by the Buddhas,” thirty-four lines and three phrases, versing the gate of “All Buddhas”; (2) from “In the past, countless kalpas,” twenty-seven and a half lines, versing the gate of “Past Buddhas”; (3) from “Future World-Honored Ones,” six and a half lines, versing the gate of “Future Buddhas”; (4) from “Honored by devas and humans,” four and a half lines, versing the gate of “Present Buddhas.”<br><br>
Now, regarding the first—versing the gate of “All Buddhas”—there are three differences from the prose: (1) what each has, the other does not; (2) the former and latter appear interspersed; (3) opening and combining differ.<br>
Above, there is “praising the Dharma as rare” but no “five corruptions”; in the verse, there are “five corruptions” but no “praising the Dharma.”<br>
Above, it first praises the Dharma; next clarifies not-falsehood; [then] opens the provisional and reveals the real. Here, it first opens the provisional and reveals the real; afterward clarifies not-falsehood.<br>
Above, exhorting faith and not-falsehood are spoken together; here, exhorting faith is separated and placed between [other parts], apart from not-falsehood.<br>
Privately, I say: above, using Śākyamuni’s expedients, he explains and completes the Buddhas’ provisional [teaching]; in the verses, using Śākyamuni’s real, he explains and completes the Buddhas’ revealing of the One—this is a fourth difference.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
此初頌文為五：初、從「諸佛所得法」下，五行三句，頌諸佛施權；二、從「我設是方便」下十三行，頌諸佛顯實；三、從「若人信歸佛」下四行半，頌諸佛章勸信；四、從「若我過眾生」下九行半長頌五濁；五、「[4]我有方便下」兩行，頌上不虛。今初釋開權，文為二：初、四行一句頌正施權；次、一行半，頌結施權意。今初，「諸佛所得法」者，修道得於諸權法也。「無量方便力」下，頌上無數方便，種種因緣演說諸法也。「眾生心念」者，頌上隨宜說法也，頌中廣出隨宜之相，即是照九法界機、說七方便，總言九七不可定判，故言若干。隨欲之宜，應用世界悉檀；隨性之宜，應用為人悉檀；隨惡業宜，應用對治悉檀。現起希望名「念」，法門不同名「種種」，過去所習名「性」，現在欣樂名「欲」，或可習欲成性，成性生習欲(云云)。「善惡業」者，七方便傳傳為善惡(云云)。佛以權智照諸方便性欲，然後以諸因緣譬喻，隨其所宜說九部經，十二部如《玄義》中說。「鈍根樂小法」者，一行半，結施權之意。前世根鈍今世無機，不堪聞大，故言「不行深妙道」；前世貪著障重，今世眾苦所惱，唯可聞[5]小，故言「為是說涅槃」也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
This first section of the verse is fivefold: (1) from “The dharma obtained by the Buddhas,” five lines and three phrases, versing the Buddhas’ application of the provisional; (2) from “I set up this expedient,” thirteen lines, versing the Buddhas’ revealing of the real; (3) from “If persons believe and take refuge in the Buddha,” four and a half lines, versing exhorting faith in the Buddhas’ chapter; (4) from “If I meet living beings,” a nine-and-a-half-line long verse raising the five corruptions; (5) from “I have expedient power,” two lines, versing the above not-falsehood.<br><br>
Now, first, he explains **opening the provisional**. The text has two: first, four lines and one phrase verse the direct application of the provisional; next, one and a half lines verse the concluding intention of applying the provisional.<br>
Now, first: “The dharma obtained by the Buddhas” means cultivating the path and obtaining the various provisional dharmas. From “with immeasurable expedient power” onward, it verses the above “countless expedients, various causes and conditions, expounding the dharmas.” “Sentient beings’ mind-thoughts” verses the above “preaching according to what is appropriate.” In the verse it broadly brings forth the marks of “according to what is appropriate”: this is illuminating the faculties of the nine dharma-realms and preaching the seven expedient means. In sum, “nine” and “seven” cannot be fixedly determined, therefore it says “various.”<br>
According to what is appropriate to desire, one should apply the worldly siddhānta; according to what is appropriate to nature, one should apply the for-the-person siddhānta; according to what is appropriate to evil karma, one should apply the therapeutic siddhānta.<br>
The presently-arisen hoping is called “thought”; the dharma-gates differing is called “various”; what was practiced in the past is called “nature”; what is delighted in the present is called “desire.” Or perhaps habitual desire becomes nature, and once nature is formed it gives rise to habitual desire (etc.). “Good and evil karma” means that the seven expedient means, transmitted successively, become good and evil (etc.).<br>
The Buddha uses provisional wisdom to illuminate the various expedients, natures, and desires; then, by various causes and conditions and parables and similes, he preaches the nine-part sūtras according to what is appropriate—twelve parts as discussed in the *Fahua Xuanyi*. From “dull roots delight in small dharma” onward, one and a half lines, it concludes the intention of applying the provisional: the roots in past lives are dull, and in this life there is no capacity, so they cannot bear to hear the Great—therefore it says “they do not practice the deep and subtle path”; in past lives they were greedy and attached, with heavy obstacles; in this life they are troubled by the multitude of sufferings, and only can hear the small—therefore it says “for these I preach nirvāṇa.”

</div>
<div class="english-translation">
From **“I say this is an expedient”** onward, the second [portion], thirteen lines, verses the Buddhas’ **revealing of the real**. The text has four:<br>
First, three lines verse **Principle-One**. “Causing them to enter Buddha wisdom” verses the above “one great cause-and-condition.” “Decisively speaking the Great Vehicle” generally verses opening, showing, awakening, and entering the Buddha’s knowledge-and-vision. “Taking entering the Great Vehicle as the root” verses the above “entering the Buddha’s knowledge-and-vision.”<br>
From “Buddha-sons’ minds are pure” onward, the second, four and a half lines, verses the above “the Buddhas, Tathāgatas, only teach and transform bodhisattvas,” thereby clarifying **Person-One**. Above it simply says “teach and transform bodhisattvas”; in the verse it broadly brings out that all the persons of the various expedient means all become real persons. “There are Buddha-sons with pure minds” are the persons of the Distinct Teaching; for these Buddha-sons he preaches the Great Vehicle sūtras; receiving prediction and rejoicing in mind, they then become true persons of the Perfect Teaching. “Śrāvakas or bodhisattvas” means that śrāvakas also include pratyekabuddhas; and “bodhisattvas” also include the six-perfections [bodhisattvas], those of the Common Teaching, and the other bodhisattvas. “All become Buddhas without doubt” means that the seven kinds of expedient means are none other than Buddha-sons—this is precisely versing **Person-One**.<br>
From “In the ten directions Buddha-lands” onward, the third, one line and three phrases, verses the above: the Tathāgata only uses the One Buddha Vehicle to preach Dharma for sentient beings; there are no other vehicles, whether two or three. If the Buddhas of the ten directions only preach one dharma, this is **Teaching-One**; using provisional names to guide is expedient teaching. It repeats the provisional names of the three teachings and reveals the Buddha-wisdom as the one teaching; its wording is clear. “No other vehicle” means there is no “remainder” of the Perfect entering the Distinct Teaching. “No two” means there is no “two” of the half/complete opposition within the Common Teaching. “No three” means there is no “three” of the Tripiṭaka Teaching. These twos and threes are all provisional names to guide sentient beings; now there is only the One Buddha’s Perfect Teaching Vehicle.<br>
From “Buddhas appear in the world; only this one matter is real” onward, the fourth, three lines and three phrases, verses the above: all that they do is always for one matter—this is the passage on **Action-One**. The “matter” is precisely action. “They never use the Small Vehicle to ferry sentient beings” is versing the above intention of “always for one great matter.” “The Buddha himself abides in the Great Vehicle; by this he ferries sentient beings” verses the above: only by the Buddha’s knowledge-and-vision does he show and awaken sentient beings. The final line explains the intention of not ferrying by the small.

### 3. Exhorting Faith and Vow Fulfillment (CBETA 004:319–331)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
從「若人信歸佛」下，第三，四行半，頌上勸信，上云「汝等當信佛之所說」。頌中有二：初、有二行半，舉果勸信，二、「舍利弗」下二行，舉因勸信。舉果[2]中，初一行半舉內[3]心，「若人信歸佛如來不欺誑」者，明佛心清淨，無明慳垢眾惡已斷淨心中說，故是可信。「我以相嚴身」下一行，明外色。身相炳著光色端嚴，內無闇惑外有光明，則口無欺誑為眾所尊，說大乘印則可信受。「我本立誓願」下二行，是舉因勸信，此亦為二：初、「我本立[4]誓」下一行，舉昔誓；二「如我昔」下一行，明願滿。我昔誓願非但自誓菩提，亦誓眾生同入佛慧，今酬誓故說，是亦可信，今菩提既滿，眾生亦入，汝既自證佛慧，亦驗我誓不虛，結成舉因勸信也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
From **“If persons believe and take refuge in the Buddha”** onward, the third [portion], four and a half lines, verses the above **exhortation to faith**; above it said: “You should believe what the Buddha has spoken.” Within the verse there are two: first, two and a half lines raise the **result** to exhort faith; second, from “Śāriputra” onward, two lines raise the **cause** to exhort faith.<br>
Within raising the result: the first one and a half lines raise the inner mind. As for “if persons believe and take refuge in the Buddha, the Tathāgata does not deceive”: this clarifies that the Buddha’s mind is pure; ignorance, stinginess, defilement, and the multitude of evils have already been cut off; spoken from a pure mind, therefore it is believable. From “I adorn my body with marks” onward, one line, clarifies outer form: the body’s marks are blazing and manifest, with dignified radiance and color; within there is no dark delusion and without there is light—therefore the mouth has no deception, and he is honored by the assembly. When he speaks the Great Vehicle seal, it is believable and acceptable.<br>
From “I originally established vows” onward, two lines, raise the cause to exhort faith; this too has two: first, from “I originally established the vow” onward, one line, raises the former vow; second, from “As I formerly.” onward, one line, clarifies the fulfillment of the vow. My former vow was not only a vow of my own bodhi; it also vowed that sentient beings together enter the Buddha’s wisdom. Now, repaying the vow, I speak—this too is believable. Now that bodhi is already fulfilled, sentient beings also enter; since you yourself have already realized the Buddha’s wisdom, you also verify that my vow is not false—thus it concludes “raising the cause to exhort faith.”

<div class="bilingual-row">

「若我遇眾生」下，第四，九行半，舉五濁，上明五濁在釋迦章後，今頌文在總佛門末，釋迦門中又更重出，此明諸佛同出五濁，皆先三後一也。此文為四：初、一行，總明五濁障大；次、六行，別明五濁[5]障三；三、一行，明為五濁故方便說小；四、一行半，明為大說小，小治五濁大願得興。

<div class="english-translation">
From **“If I meet living beings”** onward, the fourth [portion], nine and a half lines, raises the five corruptions.<br>
Above, the five corruptions were clarified as being after the Śākyamuni chapter; now the verse-text places it at the end of the gate of “All Buddhas,” and within the Śākyamuni gate it again brings it forth once more. This clarifies that all Buddhas alike appear in the five corruptions, and all preach the Three first and the One later.<br>
This text has four: first, one line generally clarifies that the five corruptions obstruct the Great; second, six lines separately clarify that the five corruptions obstruct the Three; third, one line clarifies that because of the five corruptions one expediently speaks the Small; fourth, one and a half lines clarify that for the sake of the Great one speaks the Small—the Small cures the five corruptions and the great vow is able to arise.

As for “If I meet living beings”: the *Madhyama Āgama* (Fascicle 12) says: “At the beginning of a kalpa, the Light-Sound Heaven beings descend and give rise to the world. There is no male or female, no honored or base; the multitude together gives rise to the world—therefore they are called ‘living beings’.” This is based on the very beginning.<br>
If one gathers the many aggregates and there is the provisional name “living beings,” this is based on one life’s receiving of retribution.<br>
If one says that because they receive birth everywhere they are called “living beings,” this is based on karmic power as the five destinies flow and turn.

The *Saddharma-smṛty-upasthāna* says:<br>
“There are ten kinds of living beings: long, short, square, round, triangular, blue, yellow, red, white, purple.<br>
What are living beings’ long saṃsāra-lives? While in hell, their bodies undergo inconceivable suffering and their minds think immeasurable, boundless evils. While among animals, their bodies swallow and devour one another and their minds mutually press and torment. While among ghosts, their bodies are like burning mountains and their minds are like boiling cauldrons; deviant views blaze fiercely—violent, thick-headed, and brutal. While among humans, their body, speech, and mind constantly do unbeneficial things and toil themselves in suffering; their body, speech, and mind constantly think unbeneficial things and bind themselves. While among devas, they indulge in the six sense-objects, frolicking in abandon; they do not hear the true Dharma and block the source of merit—this is called living beings’ long saṃsāra-lives.<br><br>
What are living beings’ short saṃsāra-lives? While in hell, they can in a single thought of tranquil mind take up the precepts. While among animals, they can in a single thought of tranquil mind rely on the Three Jewels. While among hungry ghosts, they can in a single thought of tranquil mind quiet their faculties. While among humans, they can cultivate the six perfections, nurture father and mother, and revere the Three Jewels, adorning body, speech, and mind with wholesome [deeds]. While among devas, they relinquish heavenly pleasure and uphold the pleasure of precepts and the pleasure of dhyāna; teaching and transforming, reading and reciting, practicing brahmacarya with few words—this is living beings’ short saṃsāra-lives.<br><br>
What is square saṃsāra-life? Like Uttarakuru: with regard to all things there is no ‘mine’; when they abandon their bodies they must ascend to heaven; from heaven they ascend again to heaven, only rising to good places—this is called square saṃsāra-life.<br>
What is round saṃsāra-life? Only within the three evil paths and the four destinies: circling and revolving round and round, like a spinning fire-wheel or swirling smoke—this is it.<br>
What is triangular saṃsāra-life? It refers to wholesome karma, unwholesome karma, and neutral [karma], etc.—this is it.<br>
What is blue saṃsāra-life? Constantly entering dark hells, constantly fearful—this is it.<br>
What is yellow saṃsāra-life? Hungry ghosts: starving and emaciated, withered and yellow—this is it.<br>
What is red saṃsāra-life? Animals devour one another; flowing blood blazing red—this is it.<br>
What is white saṃsāra-life? The wholesome path of “white karma” among humans and devas. For example, when devas are at death, other devas say: ‘You will be born into the human path.’ When humans are at death, a knowledgeable friend says: ‘You will go to the deva realm.’ You should know: these two places are white saṃsāra-life.”<br><br>
Again, in Fascicle Five it says: “The mind paints hell as black; ghosts as pigeon-colored; animals as yellow; humans as red; devas as white. What is this meaning?”<br>
Answer: “Above it spoke of the five destinies’ fruit of retribution; now it speaks of the five destinies’ karma-creation; therefore they differ (etc.).”

As for such living beings meeting the Buddha: living beings roast themselves with suffering and distress; the Buddhas rescue beings with great compassion—compassion and suffering stand opposed, therefore it is called “meeting.”<br>

Great compassion constantly pities living beings. If I used only the human-and-deva teachings, then I would fall into dark delusion: it would only avoid blue, yellow, red, purple, square, round, “wedge,” triangular, and such saṃsāra-lives—it would not be teaching the Buddha Way.<br>
If I met living beings and caused them to cultivate the Small Vehicle, then I would fall into stingy greed—this is something that cannot be: it only exits the twenty-five existences.<br>
If I met living beings and taught them the Common and Distinct [teachings], then I would fall into one-sidedness and crookedness, losing the Buddha’s knowledge-and-vision.<br>

In the past there was a Buddha named **Abiding-in-Nonabiding**. He made a vow that the living beings in his land would, on the same day at the same time, become Buddhas—and on that very day he entered extinction.<br>
Further, before the Bhadrakalpa there was a Buddha named **Equality**, who likewise vowed that the living beings in his land and the living beings of the ten directions would also, on the same day, become Buddhas—and on that very day he entered extinction.<br>
Today there is a Buddha—how is it that there are again living beings?<br>
The Buddha said: “Stop! Stop! What I said before refers to those who have obtained a human body.”<br>
Is there anyone who has made a vow that the five paths would on the same day become Buddhas?<br>
The Buddha said: “One cannot accomplish the unsurpassed Way with a body that is not a vessel. One must first transform the three evil destinies so that they obtain human-and-deva [bodies]; only then can it be as wished. The three evil destinies are not wholesome paths—how could they become Buddhas? It is like a person seeking a heap of jewels: one does not seek them in empty space.”

<div class="english-translation">
From **“the subtle form when receiving the womb”** onward, the second [portion], one line, separately clarifies the corruption of lifespan.<br>
In the contemplation-of-mind interpretation: when a single thought of mind arises, it makes karma for the future; karma is precisely the womb; womb-karma is inexhaustible, unbroken from life to life. Not being broken is precisely increase and growth.<br>
The subtle form when receiving the womb: form is the five aggregates; aggregates are named “world”; lifespan continuously holds the aggregates and enters the world. Because it begins from thin curd and goes all the way to old age and death, it is called “increasing and growing life after life”—this is lifespan-corruption.<br>
The *Receiving-the-Aggregate-Body Sūtra* says: “When an ordinary person receives a body: in the first seven [days] there is no transformation; in the second seven, there is the mark of arising like thin curd; in the third seven, like thick curd; in the fourth seven, like congealed ghee; in the fifth seven, like a lump; in the sixth seven, like a ball of flesh; in the seventh seven, from the ball of flesh five pustules arise—head, hands, feet, etc.; in the eighth seven, again five pustules: one head, two shoulders, two arms; in the ninth seven, twenty-four pustules arise in succession: four pustules make eyes, ears, nose, tongue; twenty pustules are the twenty fingers; the seventeen then turn and manifest the belly-form; gradually skin and bone separate and become various different marks; seven hundred sinews and seven thousand vessels arise; according to the marks needed, one wind dyes them—if one needs the white mark, the white wind dyes it; and so forth for the other winds as well. Because of fragrant wind, one is secure and upright; because of stinking wind, one is not secure—ugly and twisted. After emerging from the womb and eating the five grains, then eighty-thousand households of worms arise.”[^3]

As for “such people are hard to save”: because the five corruptions obstruct them, they do not believe the One Vehicle—thus they cannot be saved/delivered. In the contemplation-of-understanding interpretation: in thought after thought evil thoughts arise; there is never right contemplation and self-awakening—therefore they do not see the Buddha.

If one analyzes the delusions of the three realms until exhausted, extinguishes form and takes emptiness, that is not true extinction. If one embodies and penetrates that ignorance is originally without [arising], constantly tranquil, that is true extinction.<br>
Though the originally-without is tranquil, if one does not cultivate the path, there is no way to accord and meet [it]; therefore it says: “After Buddha-sons practice the path, in a future life they will become Buddhas.”

From “different expedients” onward: the direct-cause Buddha-nature is precisely the first-principle principle. If one uses the perfect and wondrous right contemplation, this is the expedient of real mark and is not named “different.” If one uses the seven expedient contemplations to assist in revealing first principle, it is named “different expedients.”

This is threefold: first, two lines open the bodhisattva vehicle; second, one line opens the two vehicles; third, twenty lines open the deva-and-human vehicle.<br>
Now, first: from “If there are classes of living beings” onward, two lines open the bodhisattva vehicle. If explained as five vehicles, it is only the six-perfections bodhisattva vehicle. If explained as seven expedients, it also includes the bodhisattvas of the Common and Distinct Teachings. Why? The Great Vehicle of the three teachings all practices the six perfections, but the directing of mind differs: practicing the six perfections with a marks-attached mind is the Tripiṭaka bodhisattva; without marks is the Common Teaching; neither with-marks nor without-marks, practicing the six perfections in sequence, is the Distinct Teaching. Now it only lists the six perfections, and we do not yet know to which it is definitively assigned.<br>
Searching the prose above, it said “further by different expedients”: this is not only the six-perfections bodhisattva, but the bodhisattvas’ expedients of the three teachings. Formerly, hearing the Dharma has already become Teaching-One; formerly, the practice of the six perfections has already become Action-One; thus such persons have already become Person-One; all have already become the Buddha Way and already become Principle-One.

As for “from ‘Offering the relics’ onward”: the third [part], twenty lines, opens the human-and-deva vehicle. It does not explicitly mark it as the human-and-deva vehicle, but only clarifies making images and raising stūpas, concentrated [mind] and scattered [mind]; therefore we know these are deeds of devas and humans.<br>
The Earth Master explains: “The child is the Ground of Childlike Purity; there is no desire-mind of the two extremes of the Two Vehicles and ordinary beings. Piling sand into a stūpa: sand is non-attachment; the stūpa is the accumulation of many practices, containing the mind of correct awakening.” He takes “meaning uniting with non-arising” as deep attainment; now I say it violates the text and is vertically narrow. Why? One who has reached the grounds should already become a Buddha—what is strange about an asura crossing the sea? Now, using a child playing with sand, and a scattered mind singing and reciting, pointing at the minute and immediately grasping it—like an ordinary person crossing the sea, inconceivable—the Buddha plainly and broadly gathers the five vehicles’ slightest goodness and does not let it leak, yet [that interpretation] abandons the broad intention of gathering it all and instead directly grasps non-arising. If as explained above, it scarcely includes the Two Vehicles—how much less ordinary beings? Depth is only in being the same; but if one determines breadth, it violates the sūtra text.

**Answer:** This should clarify the meaning of the **three Buddha-natures**. The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: “Further there is Buddha-nature: those with wholesome roots have it; icchantikas do not—this is precisely the human-and-deva small good.”<br>
Lowering the head and raising the hand are like the first basket of earth that begins a mountain, and the first hair’s breadth that begins a tree embracing [one] in its arms. Formerly, before expedients were opened, it was said to abide in retribution. Now, with expedients opened, this practice is the **Buddha-nature of conditional cause**; it can tend toward bodhi and form the meaning of revealing the real.

Regarding this there are two: the first nineteen lines use human-and-deva small good as seeds of conditional cause to clarify revealing the real; the later one line uses seeds of discerning cause to clarify revealing the real—consulting the text, it can be understood.<br>
The first nineteen lines are ten [items]: first, three and a half lines use stūpa-building to clarify the deva vehicle. At the time of cause, with utmost sincerity they pour out wealth and relinquish treasures; at the time of result, naturally and effortlessly they receive bliss—therefore it is the deva vehicle. As for “wood-mì”: in Chang’an there is a tree named mì; it can also be used to make images. The *Golden Light Sūtra* says: “Taking Buddha relics as small as a mustard seed and placing them in a small stūpa—within the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven there is already natural retribution.” This is its meaning.<br>
Next, from “even children” onward, the [1] second: one line. A child playing with sand and making a stūpa is human karma. At the time of cause, one casually and at ease does wholesome [deeds]; at the time of result, one intentionally and diligently seeks and obtains bliss—therefore it is human karma.<br>
Next, from “If someone, for the sake of the Buddha.” onward, the third: four lines. Using resolute sincerity in making Buddha images clarifies deva karma. The *Upāsaka-śīla Sūtra* does not permit using glue; one obtains the offense of negligent intention. Yet this sūtra uses it; [2] an ancient master says: “In foreign lands they use tree-resin.” Guangzhai says: “In some places one must, for the sake of an image, permit using ox-hide glue; if there are other things, then one must not use it.” Some say: “Soy-bean juice can replace glue and be pure.” Yet ox-[3] hide is ultimately an impure thing, and afterward one obtains an impure retribution. Impure money is not fit to make images; one can exchange it for pure money in accord with the Dharma and make images. The *Bodhisattvabhūmi* does not use realgar and stinking substances. The “Precepts Sūtra” does not permit making half-body images; one obtains the offense of negligent intention. If a wholesome mark does not arise, [4] one falls into saṃsāra. Yet in making images, each has what it models: if it is the Buddha of the main hall, it must sit; a “message Buddha” may sit or recline; a “moving Buddha” must stand. Further, disciples within stūpa-halls and image-halls must not sit before standing images—because this place definitely belongs to the Buddha. If a layperson sits in other places, and cannot long stand before the image, if he asks to sit he is permitted; but in front of a standing image he must not sit (etc.).<br>
Next, from “even children” onward, the fourth: one line clarifies human karma. Next, from “such persons” onward, the fifth: one and a half lines conclude and form revealing the real. Such persons all become Person-One; gradually accumulating merit and fully possessing the mind of great compassion then becomes Action-One; the Buddha Way then becomes Principle-One; having already become Buddhas they again can [complete] the Four Ones, only transforming bodhisattvas—this is Teaching-One (etc.).<br>
Next, from “If a person, in stūpa-shrines.” onward, the sixth: three and a half lines. Using various dusty offerings clarifies deva karma. As for “copper cymbals”: the people of Chang’an call a dew-[5] tray a copper cymbal; because in that place [the translator] was translating sūtras, he used that name.<br>
Next, from “If a person is scattered” onward, the seventh: one line. Using offerings with scattered mind clarifies human karma. Next, from “Or someone bows” onward, the eighth: one line. Using bodily-karma offering clarifies human-and-deva karma. In the phrase “bowing”: with five limbs touching the ground is the highest bow and is deva karma; joining palms and lowering the head is the middle bow and is human karma.<br>
Next, from “By these offerings” onward, the ninth: one and a half lines conclude and form [it]. Not only does revealing the real itself complete the Buddha Way, it also can open the provisional: when firewood is exhausted, nirvāṇa [is reached] (etc.).<br>
Next, from “If a person is scattered.” onward, the tenth: one line. Using verbal karma: by analogy with the above it should include human-and-deva karma; now it only brings out human karma (etc.).<br><br>
“Namo” has great meaning. Some say: “Save me, save me—this can be applied to living beings.” If the Buddha answered: “The Buddhas save me,” the meaning would not be fitting. The *Five Precepts Sūtra* calls it “frightened”; “frightened” is precisely something that can be applied to the Buddha. The dangers of birth-and-death are indeed frightening; the Great cannot save them, and now, along with the Buddhas, [we] use the Small to aid them. Applying “frightened” to the Buddha is fitting; therefore the text says: “Joyfully say ‘Namo Buddha.’” “Joy” means rejoicing in having obtained the manner of saving beings. The *Five Precepts Sūtra* also says: “Taking refuge in life—this is entirely applied to living beings.” Devadatta, at death, uttered “Namo.” Before he could utter “Buddha,” he fell into hell. The Buddha predicted that when he emerges from hell he will become a pratyekabuddha, named Namo.<br>
As for foreign lands serving a deva image: they take gold and make the image’s head. A thief comes and steals it; he cannot get it, and then says: “Namo Buddha!” and immediately obtains the head. The next day the people gather and say: “The deva image has lost its head; it must be that a no-deva has come to possess it. How could a possessor lose his head?” The deva then descends, as one person, and says: “When the thief came to take the head, he said: ‘Namo Buddha!’ and all the devas were alarmed; therefore he obtained me—therefore I lost my head.” The people say: “Is the deva not equal to the Buddha? If it is not equal, why do we not now serve the Buddha?” If even a thief saying “Namo Buddha” can obtain a deva head, how much more can a worthy person saying “Namo Buddha”! The honored spirits of the ten directions do not dare withstand it—only be diligent and do not be lax.<br>
The *Nāgasena Sūtra* says: “When a person at death says ‘Namo Buddha,’ he can avoid the mud-plough [hell]. Why? It is like a person holding one stone and placing it in water: the stone certainly sinks, with no doubt. If one can hold a hundred stones and place them on a boat, they certainly do not sink. If one dies directly, one certainly enters the mud-plough, like a stone placed in water. If, at death, one says ‘Namo Buddha,’ by Buddha-power he is caused not to enter the mud-plough—by boat-power the stones do not sink (etc.).” The *Embryo Sūtra* and the *Repaying Kindness Sūtra* say: “In the Huálín Garden’s third great assembly, the 9.2 billion persons are those in Śākyamuni’s leftover Dharma, who by one utterance of ‘Namo Buddha’ are able to see Maitreya.”

**Answer:** The Buddhas of the Three Times all have opening the provisional. Yet the future has not yet arisen and the present has only just begun; therefore, regarding the meaning to be proven, it is weak. In the past, opening the provisional has already been long; the persons who received transformation all became the Four Ones, and throughout the ten directions they apply the provisional and reveal the real—thus, in terms of the proven meaning, the matter is strong. Constructing it as empty words is not as good as verifying it through the real; therefore, for the past Buddhas, it extensively speaks the Five Vehicles.[^4]

從「未來諸世尊」下，第三，有六行半，頌上未來佛章。文為二：初一行半，頌開三；後五行，頌顯一。「度脫諸眾生」者，一行，頌人一。「諸佛本誓願」一行，頌行一，佛所行道誓令得此道，豈非行一？「未來世諸佛」兩行，頌教一。「知法常無性」者，實相常住無自性，乃至無無因性，無性亦無性，是名無性。「佛種從緣起」者，中道無性即是佛種，迷此理者，由無明為緣，則有眾生起；解此理者，由教行為緣，則有正覺起，欲起佛種須一乘教，此即頌教一也。又無性者即正因佛性也；佛種從緣起者，即是緣了。以緣資了正種得起，一起一切起，如此三性名為一乘也。「是法住法位」一行，頌理一也，眾生、正覺一如無二悉不出如，皆如法為位也。「世間相常住」者，出世正覺以如為位，亦以如為相，位相常住；世間眾生亦以如為位，亦以如為相，豈不常住？世間相既常住，豈非理一？又釋世間者，即是陰、界、入也。常住者即正因也。然此正因不即六法，緣了不離六法，正因常故緣了亦常，故言「世間相常住」也。「於道場知已」，此舉果釋成開權顯實，道場朗然斯理久暢，物情障重方便施三(云云)。

<div class="english-translation">
From **“Future World-Honored Ones”** onward, the third [portion], six and a half lines, verses the above “Future Buddhas” chapter. The text has two: the first one and a half lines verse opening the Three; the latter five lines verse revealing the One.<br>
As for “delivering and liberating all living beings”: one line verses Person-One. “The Buddhas’ original vows”: one line verses Action-One—what the Buddha practices as the path, he vows beings will obtain that path; is this not Action-One? “The Buddhas of future worlds”: two lines verse Teaching-One.<br>
As for “knowing that dharmas are constantly without nature”: real mark abides forever, without self-nature—up to and including “no nature of no-cause,” and the “no-nature” itself is also without nature; this is called “without nature.”<br>
As for “Buddha-seeds arise from conditions”: the Middle Way without nature is precisely the Buddha-seed. Those who are deluded about this principle: by ignorance as condition, living beings arise. Those who understand this principle: by teaching-and-practice as condition, right awakening arises. If one wants Buddha-seeds to arise, one must have One Vehicle teaching—this is precisely versing Teaching-One. Further, “without nature” is precisely the Buddha-nature as direct cause; “Buddha-seeds arise from conditions” are precisely the conditional and discerning causes. Using conditions to support discerning, the direct seed is able to arise; when one arises, all arise—these three natures are named the One Vehicle.<br>
“This Dharma abides in the Dharma position”: one line verses Principle-One. Living beings and right awakening are one suchness with no second, and in every case do not depart from suchness; all take “suchness-as-dharma” as their position. “Worldly marks constantly abide” means: the supramundane right awakening takes suchness as its position, and also takes suchness as its mark; position and mark constantly abide. Worldly living beings also take suchness as their position and also take suchness as their mark—how could it not constantly abide? Since worldly marks constantly abide, is this not Principle-One? Further, interpreting “world” means the aggregates, elements, and sense-fields. “Constantly abiding” is precisely the direct cause. Yet this direct cause is not identical to the six dharmas; the conditional and discerning do not depart from the six dharmas. Because the direct cause is constant, the conditional and discerning are also constant; therefore it says “worldly marks constantly abide.”<br>
As for “having known this at the place of enlightenment”: this raises the result to explain and complete opening the provisional and revealing the real. The place of enlightenment is luminous; this principle has long been set forth. Yet beings’ feelings are heavily obstructed, so expedients implement the Three (etc.).

Next, from “knowing the first quiescent extinction,” one line verses the above revealing of the real: knowing the first quiescent extinction verses Principle-One; “its reality is the Buddha Vehicle” either verses Teaching-One or verses Action-One.

From **“Now I too am thus”** onward, the second [portion], forty-three and a half lines, verses the Śākyamuni chapter. In the prose above there is no “praising the Dharma as rare”; in the verse it includes all six. But old explanations of the Śākyamuni chapter point out the “parable-basis,” indicating that above is the basis and below is the text; the meaning of the text interweaves—if one looks up commentaries one becomes dizzy; if one listens to explanations one’s mind becomes scattered; the dull are led into confusion. As for private notes: first set it down in advance; when reaching the text, then paste [it] in, in order to use it as a mirror for oneself.<br>
Now, the Śākyamuni chapter verse has, in general, two intentions: one verses above; the second is the basis for below. The upper-roots have already awakened; the middle-roots are not yet complete; therefore it is necessary to make a simile and return to parable the Dharma above. The parable does not arise in isolation; it has a causal continuity to follow upon—therefore it is called the “parable-basis.”<br>
Orally, the old [scheme] made five parables: (1) the elder parable; (2) the “thinking to rescue” parable; (3) the “provisional luring” parable; (4) the “equality” parable; (5) the “not false” parable. Yet the first is the overall parable, not only the elder; “thinking to rescue” is only the meaning of being unable to save the children, and since it still lacks the “seeing the fire” parable, it is not used.

Master Yáo says: “In the *Expedient Means* chapter, from ‘what the Buddhas preach according to what is appropriate’ up to the end of the prose, it directly reveals the One Vehicle’s reality. In general there are four parts: (1) opening the former four-threes and completing the present four-ones; (2) because of the five corruptions, one cannot speak the One Vehicle; (3) from ‘If my disciples call themselves.’ onward, clarifying those who cannot [accept it]; (4) from ‘You should single-mindedly believe and understand’ onward, clarifying not-falsehood. The beginning and end speak differently; seeking it by meaning, all are real. In the parable of the burning house below, it only parables three parts within the *Expedient Means* chapter: from ‘For example.’ up to ‘at the time of vow, bestow,’ this is the first parable, the five-corruptions part; from ‘bestow on all the children one great cart’ up to ‘obtaining what they never had,’ this is the second parable, the true-real part; from ‘the elder bestows on the children’ up to ‘how could there be falsehood?,’ this is the third parable, the not-falsehood part.”<br><br>
Master Xuánchàng says there are six parables: “(1) the marks of many calamities within the house; (2) the awakened one, only the Buddha, gives rise to the thought of One Vehicle; (3) living beings do not accept, therefore he speaks of fearful matters; (4) he speaks of the pleasures of the three vehicles; (5) he again speaks the One Vehicle teaching; (6) he concludes not-falsehood.”<br><br>
[1] Master Lóng says there are six parables: “(1) house and father-and-son: parabling the Buddha King transforming living beings in the three realms; (2) the elder sees the fire: parabling ‘I use the Buddha-eye to see the living beings of the six destinies’; (3) the elder rescues from the fire: parabling that for three periods of seven the Buddha wanted to deliver living beings but could not use the Great; (4) the elder expediently lures with three carts: parabling the Buddha setting up the three-vehicle teaching; (5) the elder bestows one great cart: parabling preaching the *Lotus*; (6) the not-falsehood parable.”<br><br>
The burning-house has ten parables: (1) “Now I too am thus,” two lines, generally versing the above provisional/real, making the basis for the overall parable below; (2) “Śāriputra, you should know,” four lines, versing the above five corruptions, making the basis for the “seeing fire” parable below; (3) “I first sat at the place of enlightenment,” six and a half lines, clarifying that transforming by the Great Vehicle does not succeed, making the basis for the “unable to save the children” parable below; (4) “Seeking and recollecting the past Buddhas,” eleven lines, clarifying that transforming by the three vehicles succeeds, making the basis for the “able to save the children” parable below; (5) “I see Buddha-sons.” one line, clarifying the arising of the Great capacity, making the basis for the “seeing the children escape danger” parable below; (6) “all with reverent mind,” one line, clarifying the three vehicles’ seeking fruit, making the basis for the “children seek carts” parable below; (7) “I then made this thought,” two lines and one phrase, clarifying the Tathāgata’s joy, making the basis for the “elder rejoices” parable below; (8) “before the bodhisattvas,” three phrases, clarifying preaching the Great Vehicle, making the basis for the “equally bestowing the great cart” parable below; (9) “bodhisattvas hear this Dharma,” one line, clarifying living beings’ joy, making the basis for the “children obtain the cart and rejoice” parable below; (10) “You must not have doubts,” one and a half lines, clarifying the Buddha has no falsehood, making the basis for the “elder not false” parable below.<br><br>
Someone evaluates this: if judged by phrases, it should have nineteen phrases; if judged by meaning, it has six meanings: (1) overall; (2) seeing fire; (3) One Vehicle transforming does not succeed; (4) three vehicles transforming succeeds; (5) again speaking the One Vehicle; (6) not false—everything else is included within these six meanings. Further, with ten parables, the Dharma-parable is uneven: in Dharma-teaching, seeking carts comes first and the father’s joy comes after; in parable-teaching, the father’s joy comes first and seeking carts comes after. Though one may want to reconcile them, in the end it becomes circuitous. Further, great and small conflict: Dharma-teaching rejoices because it sees the Great capacity move; parable-teaching rejoices because it sees the small condition escape danger. Dharma-teaching clarifies the Great cause; parable-teaching narrates the small fruit. Dharma-teaching shows the Great obstruction about to collapse; parable-teaching shows the small difficulty already departed—meanings and forces diverge. Further, because of difference in having and not-having: in Dharma-teaching it narrates upper-roots easily awakening, therefore there is no “seeking carts”; parable-teaching clarifies middle-roots still confused, therefore there is “seeking carts.” If one takes “reverent mind” as “seeking carts,” it is wholly not embodying the text’s meaning; now there are not these four failures.<br><br>
Yet regarding having and not-having: the prose has five: (1) opening the Three; (2) revealing the One; (3) five corruptions; (4) true/false; (5) not false. The verse also has five, but the prose has true/false while the verse does not; the verse has praising Dharma while the prose does not—[2] they mutually manifest. As for sequence: prose first opens the Three and later reveals the One; verse first reveals the One and later opens the Three. As for opening and combining: opening the Three and revealing the One are the basis of the overall parable; the two verses combine but do not open. Next, separating out the five-corruptions text makes the basis of the four parables; it opens but does not combine. Not-falsehood is the basis of the not-falsehood parable; it neither combines nor opens. Clarifying taking and discarding: the four segments of the sūtra text are the basis of the six parables—taken and not discarded; the “praising Dharma” section is not among the six parables, therefore it is discarded and not taken. Discussing overall vs. particular: opening the Three and revealing the One generally narrates the gate of Śākyamuni’s one transformation-teaching; from the five-corruptions onward all belong to the particular parables. Next, regarding fundamental and trace: the overall narration of the Buddha’s teaching generally includes fundamental and trace; from the five-corruptions onward it separately clarifies fundamental and trace. The five-corruptions section directly clarifies abiding in the fundamental of the dharmakāya, seeing beings’ suffering and arousing great compassion; from “One Vehicle transforming does not succeed” onward is lowering trace (etc.).<br><br>
Now I say: the great intent of the Trace Gate is precisely opening the Three and revealing the One. Earlier, direct Dharma-teaching: the upper-roots immediately awaken and understand; the middle and lower have not yet awakened, therefore again a parable is made, parabling the Three and One so that they understand. Since earlier in Dharma-teaching the Three are opened and the One revealed in both brief and broad ways, later in parable-teaching it should likewise, in brief and broad ways, permit bestowing the Three and granting the One; in the Causes-and-Conditions [week] it should likewise lead the Three into the One. If one makes three parables, six parables, or ten parables, it does not fit the text of the Three Weeks, and it diverges from the four persons’ faith and understanding—therefore it is not used.

### 8. The Śākyamuni Verse Section: Two Major Divisions (CBETA 004:393)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
今明頌釋迦章中，大分為兩：初、從「今我亦如是」下兩行偈，略頌上權實，為下總譬作本；第二從「我以佛眼觀見」下，有四十一行半偈，廣頌上六義，為下別譬作本。今約總頌中即有六意，得為總譬六義作本。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Now, in clarifying the verses in the Śākyamuni section, it is broadly divided into two:<br>
First, from “Now I too am thus” onward—two lines of verse—briefly verses the above provisional and real, and serves as the basis for the overall parable below.<br>
Second, from “I use the Buddha-eye to observe and see” onward—forty-one and a half lines of verse—broadly verses the above six meanings, and serves as the basis for the particular parables below.<br>
Now, within the “overall summary” itself there are exactly six intents; thus it can serve as the basis for the six meanings of the overall parable.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
偈云「今我亦如是」，我即釋迦，是一化之主，為下有大長者譬作本。「安隱」者，即大涅槃常樂住處，此處寂靜無五濁障，故名安隱。安隱即對不安隱，不安隱即三界生死行化之所，有五濁障名不安隱，即為下火宅譬作本。眾生即是五道受化之徒，為下五百人譬作本。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
The verse says: “Now I too am thus.” “I” is precisely Śākyamuni—the lord of the single teaching-transformation—serving as the basis for the parable below of the Great Elder.<br>
As for “secure/at ease” (*ān-yǐn*): it is the dwelling-place of the Great Nirvāṇa’s constancy and bliss. That place is quiescent and has no obstruction of the five turbidities, therefore it is called “secure/at ease.”<br>
“Secure/at ease” stands in contrast to “not secure/at ease.” “Not secure/at ease” is precisely the place of transforming within the Three Realms of birth-and-death; because it has the obstruction of the five turbidities, it is called “not secure/at ease”—and it serves as the basis for the burning-house parable below.<br>
“Living beings” are precisely those among the five paths who receive transformation; it serves as the basis for the parable below of the five hundred persons.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
又安隱者，即是安隱法，還對不安隱法，不安隱法即五濁法也，為下火起譬作本；「種種法門」即對不種種，為下唯有一門譬作本；「知眾生性欲」者，即是五道根性有三乘差別，為下三十子譬作本。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Further, “secure/at ease” is the “Dharma of being secure/at ease,” and in turn stands opposite the “Dharma of not being secure/at ease.” The Dharma of not being secure/at ease is precisely the Dharma of the five turbidities; it serves as the basis for the parable below of the fire arising.<br>
“Various Dharma-doors” stands opposite “not various”; it serves as the basis for the parable below of “only one door.”<br>
“Knowing living beings’ natures and desires” means: within the five paths, the capacities/natures of roots have the differentiations of the Three Vehicles; it serves as the basis for the parable below of the thirty children.

<div class="chinese-source">
向上即是略頌，向下即是總譬本，本[1]末相承文義整足，譬中當更引上證下(云云)。從廣頌上六義中，分文為四，作下別譬本：初從「我以佛眼觀」下四行，廣頌上五濁，為下見火譬[2]本；二、從「我[3]始坐道場」下十七行半，廣頌上於一開三，為下寢[4]大施小譬作本；三、從「我見佛子等」六行，廣頌上顯實，為下等賜大車譬作本；四、從「如三世諸佛」下有五行半，廣頌上歎法希有，次有二行半正頌上不虛，次有六行頌上敦信，此三意合為下不虛譬作本，而正用二行半頌不虛，為下不虛譬作本。

Looking upward, it is a “brief summary-verse”; looking downward, it is the basis of the overall parable. Root and branch ([1]) mutually carry and follow one another; text and meaning are fully complete. Within the parable, one should further cite the above to prove the below (etc.).<br>
Within the “broad versing” of the above six meanings, the text is divided into four, as the basis for the particular parables below:<br>
(1) From “I use the Buddha-eye to observe.” onward, four lines: broadly versing the above five turbidities, as the basis of the “seeing the fire” parable below.[2]<br>
(2) From “When I[3] first sat at the place of enlightenment.” onward, seventeen and a half lines: broadly versing the above “within the One, opening the Three,” as the basis for the “setting aside the great and bestowing the small” parable below.[4]<br>
(3) From “I see the Buddha-children.” onward, six lines: broadly versing the above revealing of the real, as the basis for the parable below of equally bestowing the great cart.<br>
(4) From “Like the Buddhas of the three times.” onward, five and a half lines: broadly versing the above praise of the Dharma as rare; next, two and a half lines directly verse the above “not false”; next, six lines verse the above “pressing faith.” These three intents together serve as the basis for the “not-false” parable below; and one specifically uses the two and a half lines versing “not false” as the basis for the “not-false” parable below.

In broad outline it is like this; in finer subdivision ([A2]) it further opens it out. In the first part (versing the five turbidities), there are three intents:<br>
First, half a line and one character: it clarifies the Buddha-eye’s observing-and-seeing,[5] serving as the basis for the later parable that the elder is able to see.<br>
Second, from “living beings in the six paths” onward—two lines, three phrases, and four characters: it clarifies the five turbidities that are seen, serving as the basis for the later parable of “the fire that is seen.”<br>
Third, from “for the sake of these living beings” onward—half a line: it clarifies the arousing of great compassion, serving as the basis for the later parable of the elder rushing in, alarmed, into the burning house.

<div class="english-translation">
Second, under “When I first sat.” if one is versing “opening the Three,” it further opens two intents:<br>
First, six and a half lines: he thinks to use the Great Vehicle to transform, but cannot succeed; this serves as the basis for the parable below of “having strength in body and hands but not using it”—setting aside the great.<br>
Next, from “Then I thought of past Buddhas.” onward, eleven lines: he thinks to be the same as the Buddhas in transforming by the Three Vehicles; this serves as the basis for the later parable of establishing the three carts and bestowing the small.

Third, within the part that verses the above revealing of the real, it further opens four intents:<br>
First, under “Śāriputra, you should know; I see Buddha-children.” two lines: it clarifies that the Great Vehicle capacity is stirred; it serves as the basis for the later parable of “seeking carts.”<br>
Next, under “I then had this thought.” the second, two lines and one phrase: it clarifies the Buddha’s joy; it serves as the basis for the later parable of “seeing the children escape difficulty.”<br>
Next, under “Before the bodhisattvas.” the third, three phrases: it directly reveals the real; it serves as the basis for the later parable of equally bestowing the one great cart.<br>
Next, under “Bodhisattvas, hearing this.” the fourth, one line: it clarifies receiving, practicing, awakening, and entering; it serves as the basis for the later parable of the children[6] obtaining the one great cart and rejoicing.<br>
The “not false” that is versed above directly serves as the basis for the “not-false” parable below, and therefore it does not discuss “opening” here.

Further, at one time one can broadly open it as three parables:<br>
First, the two lines “Now I too am thus”: combined and not separated—serving as the basis for the overall parable below.<br>
Second, from “I use the Buddha-eye to observe.” onward: separated and not combined—serving as the basis for the particular parables below.<br>
Third, the not-false parable: neither separated nor combined—serving as the basis for the not-false parable.<br>
If one carries on the “brief and broad” two versings that connect root-above to branch-below, then throughout the Three Cycles and within the Faith-and-Understanding [chapter], both text and meaning are entirely not lacking. If, by contrast, one takes the “broad versing” and further opens four intents to verse the above four meanings, as the basis for the four parables below, this too passes through the Three Cycles and within Faith-and-Understanding, with text and meaning not lacking. If one further subdivides: opening the versing of the five turbidities into three; opening the versing of expedients into two; opening the versing of revealing the real into four; and within “not false” there is only one—combining to make ten intents, as the basis for the ten parables below. Yet these ten intents exist only within the two cycles of Dharma-teaching and parable-teaching; within Faith-and-Understanding and Causes-and-Conditions, the text is then lacking. Therefore, making the three-section opening of the chapter that carries root-above to branch-below is not done pointlessly and at random.

<div class="english-translation">
Within the brief summary-verse: the first line verses the above revealing of the real; the latter line verses the above opening of the provisional. Though this text is narrow/short, it fully verses the Four Ones.<br>
“Now I too am thus”: just as it is with the Buddhas, [Śākyamuni] likewise uses the One Real to teach-transform living beings—this is the overall summary’s versing of revealing the real.<br>
As for “secure/at ease”: the secret treasury of nirvāṇa is the “secure/at-ease” place. The Buddha himself abides within it, and he also settles living beings into the secret treasury. The “secure/at-ease” place thus verses Principle-One; “living beings” verses Person-One; “various Dharma-doors entering the Buddha-way” verses Practice-One; and “proclaiming and showing” verses Teaching-One.<br>
“Power of wisdom” is precisely the power of provisional wisdom. “Knowing living beings’ natures and desires” is discerning the small capacities. “Expediently preaching the various dharmas” is precisely applying the provisional. “All making them obtain joy” is suiting what is appropriate and matching capacities.<br>
Though the two verses are brief, they gather in the Buddha’s single teaching-transformation of opening the provisional and revealing the real—[7] from origin to completion nothing is left unexhausted. Therefore it is called a “brief summary,” and is taken as the basis of the overall parable below.

Above it says: because of the five turbidities, he speaks the Three; here it says: because of the five turbidities, he “comes forth in the world.” To “come forth in the world,” fundamentally, should be to speak the Great [Vehicle], but because the obstruction does not allow it, he first speaks the Small.<br>
This further becomes three parts: first, eleven characters clarifying that the Buddha has an eye that can see; second, under “six-path living beings,” two lines, three phrases, and four characters clarifying the five turbidities that are seen; third, under “for the sake of these living beings,” half a line clarifying the arousing of great compassion in response.

<div class="english-translation">
As for the first eleven characters, “I use the Buddha-eye to observe and see”: below the text says “the elder stood outside the door.” Raising the below to prove the above, we know the Buddha is on the ground of the dharmakāya: with the Buddha-eye of constant quiescence he perfectly illuminates the assemblies of capacities. If roots are sharp and turbidities light, then (as a Rocana image) he speaks the One Vehicle Dharma. If roots are dull and turbidities heavy, then he removes his jeweled necklace and takes on the appearance of an aged bhikṣu; startled, he enters the burning house and, by expedients, opens the Three. It is nothing other than discerning the capacities at that time—therefore it says “I use the Buddha-eye to observe and see.”<br>
If one is observing material dharmas, one should use the deva-eye; if one is discriminating capacities and faculties, one should use the Dharma-eye—so how can it say that he sees with the Buddha-eye? The Buddha-eye is perfectly interfused: it raises the superior and includes the inferior. Moreover, the four eyes enter into the Buddha-eye, and all are named “Buddha-eye” (etc.).

Some say: “five heats” scorch the body; one wishes and longs to abandon suffering but instead obtains the retribution of suffering.

地獄此方名，[3]胡稱泥犁者，秦言無有，無有喜樂、無氣[4]味、無歡、無利，故云無有。或言卑下，或言墮落，中陰倒懸諸根皆毀壞故。或言無者，更無赦處。獄卒是變化令見，非眾生數，初將罪人縛至閻王所者，是眾生數，若受苦時非眾生數，如此解者初皆正語，若受苦痛聲不復可分別。畜生者形傍，行傍故名畜生。又畜生者名遍有，遍有五道中，四天三十三天悉有，而上天所乘象馬等，是福業化作，非眾生數也。又畜生者名盲冥，盲冥者，無明多故名畜生。劫初時皆解聖語，後飲食異，諂心而語皆[5]變，或不復能語。

“Hell” is this land’s name. As for the foreign term *nílí* ([3])—in Qin it is translated as “no-have/no-there” (*wú yǒu*): there is no joy, no breath-[4]flavor, no delight, no benefit; therefore it is called “no-have/no-there.” Some say it means “lowly”; some say it means “fallen,” because in the intermediate state one hangs upside down and all faculties are destroyed. Some say: “no-have/no-there” means there is no further place of pardon.<br>
The prison guards are transformations made for [beings] to see; they are not counted as “living beings.” Those who at first bind the criminal and take them to Yama are counted as living beings; when [the criminal] is receiving suffering, they are not counted as living beings. With this interpretation, at the beginning [their speech] is all “right speech”; when suffering pains [them], the sounds are no longer distinguishable as speech.<br>
“Animal” (chùshēng) is so named because its bodily form is “sideways” and its conduct is “sideways.” Further, “animals” are also named “pervasively existing”: throughout the five paths, even in the Four Dhyāna Heavens and the Trāyastriṃśa Heaven, all have [animals]. Yet the elephants and horses ridden in higher heavens are transformations of blessed karma, and are not counted as living beings. Further, “animals” are also named “blind and dark”: because ignorance is abundant, they are named animals.<br>
At the beginning of the kalpa, all understood the noble language; later, because food and drink differed, with a flattering mind their speech all [5]changed—or they were no longer able to speak.

鬼者[＊3-1]胡言闍梨多，秦言祖父，眾生最初生彼道名祖父，後生者亦名祖父；又慳貪墮此趣，此趣多饑渴，故名餓鬼；亦被諸天驅使，亦希望飲食故名餓鬼。人者[＊3-2]胡言摩㝹奢，此云意，昔頂生王初化，諸有所作，當善思惟、善籌量、善憶念，即如王教諸有所作，先思量憶念，故名人為意；又人能息意、能修道得達分；又云：人名慢，五道中多慢者稱人趣也。阿修羅者，修羅名天，阿言非，非天故稱阿修羅；又修羅名端正，彼不端正故言阿修羅；修羅名酒，阿之言無，彼無酒故言阿修羅也。天者，天然自然勝、樂勝、身勝故天名勝，眾事悉勝餘趣，常以光自照故名為天；又天者天然自然，《阿含》云：「眾生是假名，界是法，五趣眾生與法界和合，若眾生行不善心時與不善界俱，行善心時與善界俱，行勝心時與勝界俱，行鄙心時與鄙界俱，是故比丘當作是學善種種界。」前是因緣釋六趣，後似觀心釋六趣也。「為是眾生故」下，第三，有半行，明起大悲。「而起大悲心」者，上舉能見，次明所見，今明大悲熏心，應入三界施設方便，引趣佛慧也。[6]

As for “ghosts” (*guǐ*): the foreign term ([＊3-1]) is *zhēlíduō*; in Qin it is translated as “ancestor/father.” The first beings born into that destiny are called “ancestor/father,” and those born afterward are also called “ancestor/father.” Further, stinginess and greed fall into this destiny; this destiny has much hunger and thirst, therefore it is named “hungry ghosts.” They are also driven by devas, and they also long for drink and food, therefore they are named hungry ghosts.<br>
As for “humans”: the foreign term ([＊3-2]) is *mónǚshē*; this is translated as “intent/mind.” In the past, when King Mūrdhajāta first transformed [the people], in everything they did they should well contemplate, well measure, and well remember—just as the king taught: before doing anything, first measure and remember; therefore humans are named “intent/mind.” Further, humans can still/cease the mind and can cultivate the path and obtain the “portion-of-arrival.” Further, it is said: humans are named “pride”—within the five paths, those with much pride are called the human destiny.<br>
As for “asuras”: “sura” is named “deva”; “a-” means “not.” Because they are “non-devas,” they are called asuras. Further, “sura” is named “upright/beautiful”; because they are not upright, they are called asuras. “sura” is named “wine”; “a-” means “without.” Because they have no wine, they are called asuras.<br>
As for “devas”: because their naturalness and spontaneity are superior—superior in bliss and superior in body—devas are named “superior.” In all affairs they surpass the other destinies; constantly using their own light to illuminate themselves, they are named devas. Further, devas are naturally and spontaneously [so]. The *Āgama* says: “Living beings are a provisional name; realms are dharmas. The living beings of the five destinies join and combine with the dharma-realm: when living beings practice unwholesome mind, they are together with the unwholesome realm; when they practice wholesome mind, they are together with the wholesome realm; when they practice a superior mind, they are together with the superior realm; when they practice a base mind, they are together with the base realm. Therefore, bhikṣus should train thus: learn well the various realms.”[^7]<br>
The former is an explanation of the six destinies by causes-and-conditions; the latter resembles an explanation of the six destinies by contemplation-of-mind. Under “for the sake of these living beings,” the third [part], half a line, clarifies arousing great compassion. As for “and arousing a great compassionate mind”: above he raised the one able to see; next he clarified what is seen; now he clarifies great compassion perfuming the mind—one should enter the Three Realms and establish expedients, leading them toward Buddha-wisdom.[6]

#### FOOTNOTES

[^1]: **Single Three / Single Five; Containing Two / Containing Three:** Tiantai categories of provisional teachings. "Single Five/Single Three" are standalone Human-Heaven or Tripiṭaka vehicles; "Containing Two/Containing Three" are shared (common) or distinct teachings that carry Śrāvaka/Pratyekabuddha tracks within a broader schema. Zhiyi uses them to explain how expedients diversify within the One Vehicle.

[^2]: **Translator’s Note (Gendered Claim in the Source):** The statement “women, having shallow wisdom.” is translated as written. It reflects a common medieval polemical trope in Chinese Buddhist exegetical literature and is not endorsed as an evaluative claim.

[^3]: **受陰身經 (Receiving-the-Aggregate-Body Sūtra):** A Buddhist scripture frequently cited in Chinese commentaries for a week-by-week account of embryological development; here it is used to gloss the continuity of “life-turbidity” across birth and death.

[^4]: **CBETA Apparatus ([7]):** In the CBETA source for CBETA 004:380, the marker `[7]` notes a textual variant: the final particle `也` appears in the Taishō “大” reading and is absent in the “甲” witness.

[^5]: **普曜經 (Pǔyào-jīng):** A Buddha-biography scripture (commonly identified with the *Lalitavistara*) cited here for a five-destinies karmic mapping (precepts/wholesome deeds/unwholesome deeds → human/heaven/three evil destinies).

[^6]: **毘曇 / 毘婆沙 (Abhidharma / Vibhāṣā):** Refers to Sarvāstivāda Abhidharma literature and its commentarial “Vibhāṣā” tradition; the quoted material is used here to explain causes and distinctive characteristics attributed to the destinies.

[^7]: **阿含 (Āgama):** Early Buddhist discourse collections; the cited passage distinguishes “living beings” as a conventional designation while treating “realms”/“dhātu” as dharmas, and is used here to pivot from causal explanation toward an interpretation in terms of contemplation of mind.
