## IV. DETAILED EXPLANATION OF THE ŚĀKYAMUNI CHAPTER (Lines 235-240; CBETA 004:235–240)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
第二、廣釋迦章，於六義中，無歎法希有，初開權，次顯實，三舉五濁釋方便，四[4]揀偽敦信一實，五無虛妄。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Second: The Chapter Extensively Explaining Śākyamuni.**<br>
Regarding the **Six Meanings** [mentioned in the General/Four Buddhas section], this chapter lacks "Praising the Dharma as Rare."<br>
It [contains]:<br>
1.  Opening the Provisional (*Kāi Quán*).<br>
2.  Revealing the Real (*Xiǎn Shí*).<br>
3.  Raising the Five Corruptions to explain Expedients (*Jǔ Wǔzhuó shì fāngbiàn*).<br>
4.  Rejecting the False and Exhorting Faith in the One Reality (*Jiǎn wěi dūn xìn yī shí*).<br>
5.  No Falsehood (*Wú xūwàng*).
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「我今亦如是」，我即釋迦，現在先三後一，如四佛不異，故言亦復如是。「知諸眾生有種種欲」者，即是五乘根性欲也。過去名根，現在名欲，未來名性。「深心所著」者，即是根也。「方便」者，即是隨宜開三乘權法也。「如此皆為得一佛乘」者，即是顯實也。佛乘是教一，一切是行一，種智所知是理一。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**[Sutra Text]: "I now am also like this."**<br>
"I" refers to **Śākyamuni**. In the present, He first [preaches] the Three and later the One. This is no different from the Four Buddhas [of the past/future etc.], hence He says "also like this."<br>
**[Sutra Text]: "Knowing that living beings have various kinds of desires."**<br>
This refers to the **Root-Nature and Desires** (*Gēn Xìng Yù*) of the Five Vehicles.<br>
*   In the Past, it is named **Root** (*Gēn*).<br>
*   In the Present, it is named **Desire** (*Yù*).<br>
*   In the Future, it is named **Nature** (*Xìng*).<br>
**[Sutra Text]: "That to which their deep minds are attached."**<br>
This refers to the **Root**.<br>
**"Expedients"**: This is following what is appropriate to open the Provisional Dharma of the Three Vehicles.<br>
**[Sutra Text]: "All of this is for the sake of obtaining the One Buddha Vehicle."**<br>
This is **Revealing the Real** (*Xiǎn Shí*).<br>
*   "Buddha Vehicle" corresponds to **One Teaching**.<br>
*   "All" (*yīqiè*) corresponds to **One Action**.<br>
*   "What is known by [All-Seed] Wisdom" corresponds to **One Principle**.

## V. THE FIVE CORRUPTIONS (Lines 240-255; CBETA 004:240–255)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
從「十方尚無二乘，何況有三」者，是第三、舉五濁釋開權也。將舉五濁，先標其意，上已說諸佛開權顯實，未明隱實施權，其法清淨湛一如空，尚無帶二、帶三之權，況有單三、單五之權？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
From the line **"In the Ten Directions there are not even Two Vehicles, how much less are there Three"** is the **Third Part: Raising the Five Corruptions to explain Opening the Provisional.**<br>
Before raising the Five Corruptions, he first marks out the intention.<br>
Above, it already explained that all Buddhas Open the Provisional and Reveal the Real. It did not yet clarify **Hiding the Real to Implement the Provisional** (*Yǐn Shí Shī Quán*).<br>
The Dharma is pure, deeply One like Space. There is not even the "Provisional containing Two" or "Provisional containing Three"—how much less could there be the "Provisional of the Single Three" or "Single Five"?[^1]<br>
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
[＊4-5]秖為五濁障重實不得宣，須施單五、單三之權，亦施帶二、帶三之權，故言「於一佛乘分別說三」，分別說於若帶二、帶三之三，若單五、單三之三也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
It is only because the **Five Corruptions** are heavy obstacles that the Real cannot be proclaimed.<br>
Thus, one must implement the Provisional of the **Single Five** [Human/Heavenly Vehicle] and **Single Three** [Tripiṭaka].<br>
One also implements the Provisional of the **Containing Two** [Shared Teaching] and **Containing Three** [Distinct Teaching].<br>
Therefore it says: **"Within the One Buddha Vehicle, distinguishingly speaking Three."**<br>
"Distinguishing" means speaking of the "Three" that contains Two/Three, or the "Three" of the Single Five/Single Three.
</div>
</div>

### Definitions of the Five Corruptions

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「五濁」者，自有四別：初、唱數，二、列名，三、體相，四、釋結。唱數、列名如文。「如是」者，明體相也。劫濁無別體，劫是長時，剎那是短時，但約四濁立此假名，文云「劫濁亂時」，即此義也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Regarding the **Five Corruptions** (*Wǔ Zhuó*), there are four distinctions:<br>
1.  Chanting the Number.<br>
2.  Listing the Names.<br>
3.  Substance and Marks (*Tǐ Xiàng*).<br>
4.  Explanation and Conclusion.<br>
"Chanting the number" and "Listing the names" are as in the text.<br>
**[Sutra Text]: "Thus..." (*Rúshì*)** clarifies the Substance and Marks.<br>
1.  **Corruption of the Kalpa (*Jié Zhuó*):** It has no separate substance. "Kalpa" is a long time; "Kṣaṇa" is a short time. This false name is established only with regard to the [other] Four Corruptions.<br>
The text says "The time when the Corruption of the Kalpa is chaotic/disordered"—this is the meaning.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
眾生濁亦無別體，攬見慢，果報上立此假名，文云「眾生垢重」，即此義也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
2.  **Corruption of Living Beings (*Zhòngshēng Zhuó*):** This also has no separate substance. It establishes this false name based on **Views** (*Jiàn*) and **Pride** (*Màn*) upon the Retribution (*Guǒbào*) [of the Aggregates].<br>
The text says "Living Beings are heavy with filth"—this is the meaning.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
煩惱濁指五鈍使為體，見濁指五利使為體，命濁指連持色心為體(云云)。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
3.  **Corruption of Afflictions:** Points to the **Five Dull Drivers** (*Wǔ Dùn Shǐ*) as its substance.<br>
4.  **Corruption of Views:** Points to the **Five Sharp Drivers** (*Wǔ Lì Shǐ*) as its substance.<br>
5.  **Corruption of Life-span:** Points to the **Connecting and Holding of Form and Mind** (*Liánchí Sè Xīn*) as its substance.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
相者，四濁增劇聚在此時，瞋恚增劇刀兵起，貪欲增劇飢餓起，愚癡增劇疾疫起，三災起故煩惱倍隆、諸見轉熾，麁弊色心惡名穢稱，摧年減壽眾濁交湊，如水奔昏風波鼓努魚龍攪撓，無一憀賴時使之然。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Regarding the **Marks** (*Xiàng*):<br>
The Four Corruptions increase and intensify, gathering in this time.<br>
*   When **Anger** increases intensely, the [Disaster of] Weapons arises.<br>
*   When **Greed** increases intensely, the [Disaster of] Famine arises.<br>
*   When **Ignorance** increases intensely, the [Disaster of] Pestilence arises.<br>
Because the Three Disasters arise, Afflictions doubly flourish, and Views turn blazing.<br>
Coarse and vile Form and Mind, evil names and filthy designations, destroying years and reducing lifespan—the Multitude of Corruptions gather together (*jiāocòu*).<br>
### Q&A: Do Corruptions Obstruct the Small? (Lines 250-256; CBETA 004:250–256)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
問：五濁障小不？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Question:** Do the Five Corruptions obstruct the Small [Vehicle]?
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
答：此就小乘，應四句分別：小乘根利遮輕，障不能障，身子是也；根利遮重，障亦不能障，央掘是也；根鈍遮輕亦不為障，槃特是也；根鈍遮重，此則成障，不聞小乘、不得度者是。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Answer:** Regarding the Small Vehicle, one should distinguish **Four Phrases** (*Sì Jù*):<br>
1.  **Roots Keen, Obscuration Light:** The Obstacle cannot obstruct. Example: **Śāriputra**.<br>
2.  **Roots Keen, Obscuration Heavy:** The Obstacle also cannot obstruct. Example: **Aṅgulimāla** (*Yāngjué*, the serial killer).<br>
3.  **Roots Dull, Obscuration Light:** Also not obstructed. Example: **Cūḍapanthaka** (*Pántè*, who couldn't memorize a verse).<br>
4.  **Roots Dull, Obscuration Heavy:** This then forms an obstacle; they do not hear the Small Vehicle and do not obtain deliverance.
</div>
</div>

### Q&A: Hearing the Great Outside the Teachings? (Lines 260-266; CBETA 004:260–266)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
問：自有不在《華嚴》，不在三藏而得聞大、聞小乘者，何也？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Question:** There are those who are not present at the *Avataṃsaka* and not present at the *Tripiṭaka* [assemblies], yet obtain the hearing of the Great or Small Vehicles. Why is this?
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
答：此就四教，教教中作四門分別... 兩教四門，約小乘分別，兩教四門，約大乘分別，細推可解(云云)。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Answer:** This depends on the Four Teachings. Within each Teaching, one makes a distinction of **Four Gates**.<br>
*   **Roots Keen / Obscuration Light:** They enter by hearing the **Neither-Empty-Nor-Existing Gate**.<br>
*   **Roots Keen / Obscuration Heavy:** They enter by hearing the **Both-Empty-And-Existing Gate**.<br>
*   **Roots Dull / Obscuration Light:** They enter by hearing the **Empty Gate**.<br>
*   **Roots Dull / Obscuration Heavy:** They enter by hearing the **Existing Gate**.<br>
Detailed inference can explain this (etc.).

### Why Corruptions Obstruct Great but Not Small (Lines 268-274; CBETA 004:268–274)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
問：五濁一往何故障大而不障小？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Question:** Generally speaking, why do the Five Corruptions obstruct the Great but not the Small?
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
答：眾生濁重，妄計五陰為四德，若聞常我即執非為是... 無所知曉故濁障大也。文云：「我若讚佛乘，眾生沒在苦」，即此義也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Answer:** The Corruption of Sentient Beings is heavy. They falsely calculate the Five Aggregates to be the **Four Virtues** [Permanence, Bliss, Self, Purity].<br>
If they hear of [True] Permanence and Self [of the Great Vehicle], they immediately grasp the false as true [reinforcing their delusion].<br>
Like an old doctor dealing with stubborn/foolish children who do not know good medicine from bad, do not know the source of illness, and do not know the Opening or Covering of prescriptions. Because they know nothing, the Corruption obstructs the Great.<br>
The text says: *"If I were to praise the Buddha Vehicle, sentient beings would sink into suffering."* This is the meaning.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
若聞無常、苦、空，即厭生死、欣涅槃，破其邪計執，故五濁不障小...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
If they hear [the Small Vehicle teachings of] **Impermanence, Suffering, and Emptiness**, they immediately loathe Birth and Death and delight in Nirvana. This breaks their grasping of crooked calculations. Therefore, the Five Corruptions do not obstruct the Small.<br>
The text says: *"Making this thought, the Buddhas of Ten Directions appeared... comforting me."* This is the meaning.
</div>
</div>

### Detailed Analysis of Corruptions and Disasters (CBETA 004:274–289)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
約五濁論四悉檀者，劫、命是世界，眾生、見是為人，煩惱是對治，用三悉檀除其五濁，後為說大第一義悉檀也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Regarding the Four Siddhāntas:**<br>
*   **Kalpa and Life-span:** Corresponds to the **Worldly Siddhānta**.<br>
*   **Sentient Beings and Views:** Corresponds to the **Individual Siddhānta** (*For-Others*).<br>
*   **Affliction:** Corresponds to the **Therapeutic Siddhānta** (*Counteracting*).<br>
Using these Three Siddhāntas removes their Five Corruptions. Afterwards, for their sake, speak the **First Principle Siddhānta** [The Great Vehicle].
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
若論因果則二因三果... 瞋恚增劇刀兵起，貪欲增劇飢餓起，愚癡增劇疾疫起...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Regarding Cause and Fruit:** There are Two Causes and Three Fruits...<br>
*   When **Anger** increases intensely, **Weapons/War** arise.<br>
*   When **Greed** increases intensely, **Famine** arises.<br>
*   When **Ignorance** increases intensely, **Pestilence** arises.<br>
The **Three Small Disasters** harm people but do not harm inanimate things (*wù*). The **Three Great Disasters** harm inanimate things but do not harm people.
</div>
</div>

### 4. Rejecting the False and Exhorting Truth (Lines 290-298; CBETA 004:290–298)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
從「若我弟子自謂」下，是第四[＊4-2]揀偽敦真。若佛弟子自能信解，若不信解非真弟子亦非羅漢，敦逼時眾令信受解。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
From the line "If my disciples call themselves Arhats..." is the Fourth Part: **Rejecting the False and Exhorting the True** (*Jiǎn wěi dūn zhēn*).<br>
If one is a Buddha-Disciple, one is naturally able to believe and understand. If one does not believe or understand, one is not a True Disciple nor an Arhat.<br>
This exerts pressure (*dūn bī*) on the assembly of the time to cause them to believe, accept, and understand.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
[＊4-4]揀又為二：初、若不聞、不知，非真弟子；次、聞不信受，成增上慢。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Rejecting the False** has two parts:<br>
1.  **If they do not Hear or Know:** They are not True Disciples.<br>
2.  **If they Hear but do not Believe/Accept:** They become persons of Overweening Pride (*Zēngshàng màn*).
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
不聞者，即不聞教一；不知者，即不知行一。非真即非理一，非弟子即非人一也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**"Not Hearing":** Means not hearing the **One Teaching**.<br>
**"Not Knowing":** Means not knowing the **One Action**.<br>
"Not True [Arhat]" means not [knowing] **One Principle**.<br>
"Not [Buddha] Disciple" means not [being part of] **One Person**.
</div>
</div>

#### The Exception: After the Buddha's Extinction (CBETA 004:298–306)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「除佛滅」下，第二開除釋疑者，先開除，除佛滅後不成增上慢... 次、釋疑。若佛滅後解經人難遇，得羅漢者即永[6]入涅槃耶？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
From "Except after the Buddha's Extinction..." is the Second Part: **Making an Exception to Resolve Doubt.**<br>
First, the **Exception**: After the Buddha's extinction, [not believing] does not constitute Overweening Pride. [Because "Good Teachers are hard to find"].<br>
Second, **Resolving Doubt**: If after Buddha's extinction, people who understand the Sutra are hard to meet, will those who attain Arhatship entering Nirvana [be lost] forever?
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
即釋云，是人雖生滅度之想，捨命已後便生界外有餘之國，值遇餘佛得聞此經，即便決了。《釋論》第九十三釋〈畢定品〉云... 羅漢三界漏因緣盡，更不復生三界，出三界外有淨佛土，無煩惱名，於是國土佛所，聞《法華經》具足佛道。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
The text explains: Although this person produces the thought of Extinction [Nirvana], after shedding their life/body, they are immediately born in a **Land with Remainder outside the Three Realms** (*Jièwài Yǒuyú Guó*).<br>
There, they meet another Buddha, obtain hearing of this Sutra, and immediately resolve/understand it.<br>
The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra* (Fascicle 93, *Certainty Chapter*) says:<br>
> "The Arhat's causes and conditions for outflows in the Three Realms are exhausted. He is not born again in the Three Realms. He exits the Three Realms to a Pure Buddha Land outside—called 'No Affliction'. In that Land, at that Buddha's place, he hears the *Lotus Sutra* and completes the Buddha Way."

## VI. EXPLANATION OF THE VERSES (Lines 299-314; CBETA 004:299–314)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
第二偈頌有一百二十一行，分為二：初、有四行一句，頌上許答；後有一百十六行三句，頌上正答。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
The **Second [Major Section]** consists of Verses (*Gāthā*), totaling 121 lines. Divided into two:<br>
1.  **4 Lines and 1 Phrase:** Praising the previous "Permission to Answer."<br>
2.  **116 Lines and 3 Phrases:** Praising the previous "Correct Answer."
</div>
</div>

### 1. Verses on Selection (Lines 299-306; CBETA 004:299–306)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「小智」者不得學、無學智，而有世間小智，妄謂有漏以為無漏，小中之小故言小智也。「糟糠」者，無無漏禪定潤故如糟，無理慧故如糠。是五千等有世間禪如糟，有文字解如糠...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**"Small Wisdom":** They do not obtain the Wisdom of Learning (*Śaikṣa*) or No-Learning (*Aśaikṣa*). They only have worldly small wisdom. They falsely call the Leaking (*Āsrava*) "Leakless" (*Anāsrava*). Being the "Small within the Small," it is called Small Wisdom.<br>
**"Chaff and Bran":**<br>
*   Having no moisture of Leakless Dhyāna Samādhi, they are like **Chaff** (*Zāo* - dregs/grains after brewing).<br>
*   Having no Wisdom of Principle, they are like **Bran** (*Kāng* - husk).<br>
The Five Thousand had worldly meditation like Chaff, and literal textual understanding like Bran. Sealing themselves in the text and missing the meaning is like "Bran without Rice."
</div>
</div>

### 2. Verses on the Correct Answer (Lines 308-315; CBETA 004:308–315)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
從「諸佛所得法」下，有一百十六行三句，頌上正答也 ... 與長行凡有三異：一、彼此互無，二、前後間出，三、開合不同。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
From "The Dharma obtained by the Buddhas..." onwards (116 lines) praises the Correct Answer.<br>
Compared to the Prose section (*Cháng háng*), there are **Three Differences**:<br>
1.  **Mutual Absence:** Prose had "Praising Dharma" but no "Five Corruptions"; Verse has "Five Corruptions" but no "Praising Dharma."<br>
2.  **Sequence:** Prose orders **Praise → No Falsehood → Open Provisional / Reveal Real**; Verse orders **Open Provisional / Reveal Real → No Falsehood**.<br>
3.  **Opening/Combining:** Prose combines "Exhorting Faith" with "No Falsehood"; Verse separates them.
</div>
</div>

### 3. Verses on Vow Fulfillment (Lines 319-331; CBETA 004:319–331)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
從「若人信歸佛」下，第三，四行半，頌上勸信... 「我本立誓願」下二行，是舉因勸信...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
From "If persons believe and take refuge in the Buddha" (4.5 lines) praises Exhorting Faith.<br>
From "I originally established a Vow" (2 lines) praises the Cause [of the Vow] to Exhort Faith.<br>
My original Vow was not only self-vowed Bodhi, but vowed that living beings would also enter the Buddha's Wisdom. Now, repaid by the Vow, I speak this; thus it is credible.
</div>
</div>

#### Q&A: Is the Vow Fulfilled?

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
問：本誓既普，今眾生尚多，願云何滿？
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Question:** Since the Original Vow was universal, and living beings today are still many, how is the Vow fulfilled?
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
答：佛三世益物，今明現在論願滿也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Answer:** The Buddha benefits beings in the Three Times. Here, it discusses the fulfillment of the Vow regarding the **Present** [Assembly/Dispensation].

### 4. Verses on the Five Corruptions (Lines 333-346; CBETA 004:333–346)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「若我遇眾生」下，第四，九行半，舉五濁... 此明諸佛同出五濁，皆先三後一也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
From "If I meet living beings..." (9.5 lines) raises the Five Corruptions.<br>
This clarifies that All Buddhas appear in the Five Corruptions and all [preach] the Three first and the One later.

Like the people of **Uttarakuru** (Northern Continent): regarding all objects, they have no sense of "Mine." When they shed their bodies, they are necessarily born in Heaven. From Heaven, they go again to Heaven. They only ascend to good places.<br>
This is named the "Square/Squared-off" Mortality.

**The Colors of Mortality:**<br>
*   **Blue Mortality:** Constantly entering Dark Hells, constantly fearful.<br>

*   **Red Mortality:** Animals—devouring one another, flowing blood blazing forth.<br>
*   **White Mortality:** The "White Karma" (Wholesome) path of Humans and Gods.

佛言：「不可以非器之身成無上道，要先化三趣令得人天，然後乃可如願... 如人求寶聚不於空中求。」

<div class="english-translation">
The Buddha said: "One cannot accomplish the Unsurpassed Way with a body that is a **Non-Vessel** (*Fēi Qì*). One must first transform the Three Evil Destinies to obtain Human or Heavenly [bodies], and only *then* can the Vow be fulfilled...<br>
Like a person seeking a heap of jewels—one does not seek them in the empty sky."

### 5. Verses on No Falsehood (Lines 347-350; CBETA 004:347–350)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「我雖說涅槃」下，第四，一行半，即是終令入大，析三界妄盡，滅色取空則非真滅...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
From "Although I preach Nirvana..." (1.5 lines). This is finally causing them to enter the Great.<br>
Analyzing the Three Realms until delusion is exhausted, extinguishing Form and taking Emptiness—this is **Not True Extinction**.<br>
If one embodies/penetrates that Ignorance is originally Tranquil and Extinct, *that* is True Extinction.

### 6. Small Acts Become the Buddha Way (Lines 360-370; CBETA 004:360–370)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
此應明三佛性義... 低頭舉手，為山始簣，合抱初毫...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
This clarifies the meaning of **Three Buddha Natures**.<br>
*   **Action:** Bowing the head, raising a hand.<br>
*   **Result:** Like the first basket of earth for a mountain, or the first hair's breadth of a great tree.<br>
Formerly, when Expedients were not yet opened, we called this "Goodness dwelling in Retribution."<br>
Now that Expedients are opened, this is the **Conditional Cause Buddha Nature** (*Yuányīn Fóxìng*). It can tend toward Bodhi and establish the meaning of Revealing the Real.
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「乃至童子」下，第二，一行，童子戲砂作塔即是人業... 「若人散亂」下... 「以此供養」下...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**"Even children in play":** Piling sand to make stupas is Human Karma. A causal act done casually/playfully results in the fruit of diligent seeking offering joy.<br>
**"If persons with scattered minds":** Offering a flower or music is Human Karma.<br>
**"By these Offerings":** Not only does Revealing the Real manifest the Buddha Way, but "Opening the Provisional" also [means] when the firewood is exhausted, Nirvana is reached.

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「南無」大有義... 調達臨終稱南無，未得稱佛便墮地獄，佛記其從地獄出，當作辟支佛，字曰南無。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**"Namo" (Homage):** Has great meaning.<br>
**Devadatta** (*Diàodá*), at the end of his life, cried out "Namo!" He did not get to say "Buddha" before he fell into Hell.<br>
The Buddha predicted that when he emerges from Hell, he will become a Pratyekabuddha named **Namo**.<br>
When a thief/tiger comes to take a head, or one falls in water: simply crying "Namo Buddha" relies on the Power of the Buddha (like a boat for a stone) to avoid sinking into the Muddy Plough (*Nílí* - Hell).

### 7. Past, Future, and Present Buddhas (Lines 384-388; CBETA 004:384–388)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
從「未來諸世尊」下，第三，有六行半，頌上未來佛章... 「知法常無性」者，實相常住無自性...
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
**Future Buddhas:**<br>
**"Knowing Dharmas are constantly without Nature":** Real Mark abides forever without Self-Nature (*Svabhāva*).<br>
**"Buddha Seeds arise from Conditions" (*Fózhǒng cóng yuán qǐ*):**<br>
*   The Middle Way without Nature is the **Direct Cause** (Buddha Nature).<br>
*   Delusion about this Principle is the condition for **Living Beings** to arise.<br>
*   Understanding this Principle is the condition for **Enlightenment** to arise.<br>
**"Worldly Marks Constantly Abide" (*Shìjiān xiàng chángzhū*):** The Worldly Marks (Five Skandhas) take Suchness as their Position/Mark. Since Suchness is permanent, the Marks are permanent.

3.  **Hungry Ghosts:** Sanskrit *Preta* (translit. *Jālíduō*). Qin says "Ancestor/Father" (*Zǔfù*). Originally the first born in that path, hence the name; also called "Hungry Ghost" because of craving.<br>

#### FOOTNOTES

[^1]: **Single Three / Single Five; Containing Two / Containing Three:** Tiantai categories of provisional teachings. "Single Five/Single Three" are standalone Human-Heaven or Tripiṭaka vehicles; "Containing Two/Containing Three" are shared (common) or distinct teachings that carry Śrāvaka/Pratyekabuddha tracks within a broader schema. Zhiyi uses them to explain how expedients diversify within the One Vehicle.
