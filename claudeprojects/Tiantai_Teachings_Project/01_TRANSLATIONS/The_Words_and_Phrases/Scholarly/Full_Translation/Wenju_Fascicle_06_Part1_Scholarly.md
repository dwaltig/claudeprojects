### 2. General Parable Verses (Lines 16-24)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
總頌六意，六意中止頌其四，兼得其二，頌家宅兼得一門，頌五百人兼得三十子。初一句明長者，即頌上位號，即兼得名行歎德。既有長人之德，即知名行遍為國邑所崇，亦知內外年德俱高也，內合婆伽婆即位號，自知具足智斷慈悲萬德也。「有一大宅」下，第二，三行一句，頌上第二家宅譬，為二：初一句頌宅廣大；「其宅久故」下，第二，三行，廣出宅體，明所燒之相，故知此頌宅體也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
It generally versifies six meanings; within the six meanings it only versifies four, and by that also gains two: versifying the house and dwelling also gains the one door; versifying the five hundred people also gains the thirty sons. The first sentence clarifies the elder, that is, it versifies the previous rank and title, and thereby also includes name‑and‑conduct and praising virtue. Since he has the virtue of a great person, we know his name and conduct are honored throughout countries and cities, and we also know his inner and outer age and virtue are both high. Internally it corresponds to Bhagavat[^23], namely the rank and title, knowing he fully possesses the myriad virtues of wisdom‑and‑severance and compassion.[^24] Below “There is a great house,” second, there are three lines and one phrase, versifying the previous second parable of the house, in two parts: first, one sentence versifies the house’s vastness; below “The house is old and worn,” second, three lines broadly set out the house’s substance and clarify the marks of what is burned; therefore we know this versifies the house‑substance.
</div>
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
三界無始為「久」，非今所造為「故」，無常卑鄙名「頓弊」。亦云頭殿、腹堂、背為舍，念念相續無常為「高危」。一云，色界為「堂」，欲界為「舍」，不免墮落名「高危」，命根支持如「柱」，過去行業為「基陛」也。亦云，兩足為「柱根」，三相所遷名「摧朽」也。意識綱維以為「梁棟」，諸苦所壞如「傾斜」。亦云脊骨為「梁棟」，𦝣為「基陛」，衰老之時為「頹毀」。「牆壁」者，一云，四大為「牆壁」，皮膚為「泥塗」，四威儀不正為「亂墜」，五識不聰不相主境為「差脫」。亦云，「牆壁[A1]圮圻」如皮膚皴朽，壯色鮮淨如初泥塗，老色枯悴如後褫落，髮髭朽老則皆脫落如「覆苫亂墜」，筋骨老弱支節不援如「椽梠荖脫」。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
The three realms[^5] are beginningless, therefore “long”; not made now, therefore “old”; impermanent and base are called “dilapidated.” It is also said: head as pavilion, belly as hall, back as house; moment‑to‑moment succession and impermanence is “high and dangerous.” One also says: the form realm[^6] is the “hall,” the desire realm[^7] is the “house”; not avoiding falling is called “high and dangerous.” The life faculty[^8] supports like “pillars,” past actions are the “foundation steps.” It is also said: the two feet are “pillar roots,” and being moved by the three marks[^9] is called “rotting.” The network of mental consciousness[^10] is taken as “beams and ridgepoles,” and being ruined by the sufferings is like “leaning.” It is also said: the spine is “beams and ridgepoles,” the buttocks are “foundation steps,” and in old age it is “crumbling.” “Walls”: one says the four elements[^11] are “walls,” skin is “mud plaster,” the four deportments[^12] being improper is “falling down,” and the five consciousnesses[^13] being dull and not mutually governing objects is “coming apart.” It is also said: “walls [A1] crumbling” are like skin chapping and rotting; robust color and freshness are like the first plastering, old color and withering are like later peeling; hair and beard decaying and falling are like “thatched coverings falling in disorder,” and sinews and bones weakening with the joints unsupported are like “rafters and beams decaying and falling.”

### 3. Obstacles and Impurities (Lines 34-37)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「周障屈曲」者，印師云：「三十六物更相隔障故云周障，猪[1]腸盤迴故云屈曲，非但無常所遷，亦有不淨苦等，故云雜穢充遍也。」今云，「周障」是六識，「屈曲」是六根，六識緣六根取境，艱關故言「屈曲」，六塵遍染六根故言「雜穢充[2]遍」。因緣、觀心兩番釋(云云)。「有五百人」下，第三，半行，頌上第三，五百人譬。三乘根性為五道所攝，兼得三十子譬也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
“Encircling obstacles and crookedness”: Master Yin[^14] says, “The thirty‑six substances[^15] mutually obstruct, therefore ‘encircling obstacles’; pig intestines [1] coil and turn, therefore ‘crookedness.’ Not only are they shifted by impermanence, there are also impurity and suffering, therefore it is said ‘miscellaneous filth fills everywhere.’” Now we say: “encircling obstacles” are the six consciousnesses[^16]; “crookedness” are the six roots[^17]; the six consciousnesses condition on the six roots to grasp objects, and because it is difficult and obstructed it is called “crookedness”; the six dusts[^18] pervasively stain the six roots, therefore it is said “miscellaneous filth fills [2] everywhere.” This is explained in two ways—by dependent origination[^19] and by contemplation of mind[^20] (etc.). Below “there are five hundred people,” third, a half line, it versifies the previous third parable, the five hundred people: the roots of the three vehicles[^21] are included within the five paths[^22], and it also gains the parable of the thirty sons.

## II. DETAILED PARABLE: 5 BLUNT & 5 SHARP ENVOYS (Lines 37-60; CBETA 006:37–60)

### 1. Introduction to Fire Arising (Lines 37-39)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
從「鴟梟」下，第四，有二十九[3]行偈，正頌上第五火起。就此復四：初有二十二偈，明地上事，譬欲界火起；次第二有三偈半，明穴中事，譬色界火起；次第三有二偈半，明空中事，譬無色[4]界火起；後第四，一偈，總結眾難非一。就欲界火起復為四：初十七偈半，明所燒之類，譬眾生十使；次第二[5]有一偈[6]半，明火起之由，譬起五濁所由；次第三，[7]一行半，正明火起之勢，譬正起五濁；[8]後第[9]四，一行半，明被燒之相，譬受八苦五濁。就第一，十七行半復二：初十六行，正明所燒；後一行半，總結。就所燒中又二：初六行，明禽獸被燒，譬五鈍使眾生；後十行，明鬼神被燒，譬五利使眾生。第一五鈍使，為二：初五行半，明五鈍；第二，半行，結。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
From "Kites and owls" downward, fourth, there are twenty-nine [3] lines of gatha, directly versifying the fifth above, the arising of fire. Within this there are again four: first there are twenty-two gatha, explaining matters on the ground, parabling the arising of the fire in the desire realm; second there are three and a half gatha, explaining matters in holes, parabling the arising of the fire in the form realm; third there are two and a half gatha, explaining matters in the air, parabling the arising of the fire in the formless [4] realm[^32]; fourth, one gatha, in general concludes that the many dangers are not just one. For the desire-realm fire arising there are again four: first seventeen and a half gatha explain the kinds being burned, parabling beings' ten envoys[^25]; second [5], one and a half gatha explain the causes of the fire's arising, parabling the causes for the five turbidities[^28]; third, [7] one and a half lines directly explain the momentum of the fire's arising, parabling the actual arising of the five turbidities; [8] fourth [9], one and a half lines explain the appearance of being burned, parabling receiving the eight sufferings[^29] and five turbidities. For the first, seventeen and a half lines again have two: first sixteen lines directly explain what is burned; later one and a half lines make the general conclusion. Within what is burned there are again two: first six lines explain birds and beasts being burned, parabling beings with the five blunt envoys[^26]; later ten lines explain ghosts and spirits being burned, parabling beings with the five sharp envoys[^27]. The first, five blunt envoys, has two: first five and a half lines explain the five blunt; second, a half line concludes.

### 2. The Five Blunt Envoys (Lines 40-49)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
今初五鈍為五：初半行[10]譬慢使。眾生自舉輕他，如鳥為性陵高下視。八鳥譬八慢，《文殊問經》明八憍，今用配八鳥。盛壯憍如鴟，性[11]憍如梟，富憍如雕，自在憍如鷲，壽命憍如烏，聰明憍如鵲，行善憍如鳩，色憍如鴿，陵他為憍、自貴為憍，自愛為貪、愛他為[12]淫，自忿為恚、忿他為瞋，自惑為愚、惑他為癡(云云)。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Now first, the five blunt are five: first, a half line [10] parables the arrogance envoy. Beings raise themselves and belittle others, like birds whose nature is to soar high and look down. The eight birds parable the eight arrogances[^30]; the Manjushri Inquiry Sutra[^31] clarifies the eight arrogances, and here they are paired with the eight birds. Arrogance of vigorous strength is like the kite; arrogance of nature [11] is like the owl; arrogance of wealth is like the eagle; arrogance of freedom is like the vulture; arrogance of lifespan is like the crow; arrogance of intelligence is like the magpie; arrogance of doing good is like the turtledove; arrogance of form is like the pigeon. Looking down on others is arrogance; esteeming oneself is arrogance. Self-love is greed; loving others is [12] lust. Self-anger is resentment; anger toward others is fury. Self-delusion is stupidity; deluding others is ignorance (etc.).
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
次「蚖蛇」下，第二，二句，譬瞋使。瞋有三：蚖毒盛，不觸而吸，譬非理生瞋；蝮[13]蠍觸則螫，譬執理瞋；蜈蚣譬戲論瞋。世人云，赤頸者是蜈蚣，不赤者是蚰[A2]蜒。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Next, below "vipers and snakes," second, two phrases, parables the anger envoy. Anger has three: the viper's poison is intense, it sucks without touching, parabling anger arising without reason; the adder [13] stings when touched, parabling anger that clings to reasons; the centipede parables contentious anger. People of the world say: the red-necked is a centipede; the non-red-necked is an A2 millipede.
</div>

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「守宮」下，第三，二行，譬癡使。癡有獨[14]起、相應起，守宮百足等兀然，譬獨頭無明，狖狸鼷鼠等譬相應也。「諸惡[15]蟲輩」下，從癡根本備起諸結也。明諸使相緣，或緣三界如交橫，起之速疾如馳走。「屎尿」下一行，明癡心所著之境，皆無常、苦、無我、不淨，由癡不了，於中計淨等而生染著，故云「蜣蜋諸[＊15-1]蟲而集其上」。

Below "geckos," third, two lines, parables the ignorance envoy. Ignorance has arising-alone [14] and arising-in-conjunction; geckos, millipedes, and the like are inert, parabling single-headed ignorance; weasels, foxes, and mice parable the concomitant. Below "various evil [15] insects," from the root of ignorance all the knots are fully raised. This clarifies the mutual conditioning of the envoys: they may condition the three realms like crisscrossing, and their arising is swift like running. The next line "dung and urine" clarifies the objects to which the ignorant mind clings: all are impermanent, painful, not-self, and impure; because ignorance does not understand, it takes purity and so forth within them and gives rise to defiled attachment, therefore it says "dung beetles and various [*15-1] insects gather on it."

「狐狼」下，第四，二行，明貪使。貪有二種：一有力，二無力。有力者，以威勢取，如狐狼等；無力者，但能從他乞索麁弊，如野干等。「咀嚼」下，明貪取境，引物向己如「咀嚼」，不以道理如「踐踏」。貪心取境，或取一城、或取一國，其有齊畔如「䶩囓」也。亦云，貪心取境有用不用，有用[16]而取如「咀嚼」，不用而取如「踐踏」，又少則咀嚼，多則踐踏也。「骨肉狼藉」者，積聚五塵不知止足也。「由是群狗競來搏撮」者，此有力貪，搏撮無力之者，謂王賊也。「饑羸慞惶」者，常不知足如饑，求不能得如羸，種種營覓如慞惶，多欲之人雖富而貧也。愛心貪，貪五塵之肉；見心貪，貪道理之骨，推求知見遂多所解即是多骨，須骨之狗競來撮之。諸見心中，未得正法之食名飢，不能伏斷見名羸，處處求解名為慞惶。一云，即是貪人希求念望也。

<div class="english-translation">
Below "foxes and wolves," fourth, two lines, clarifies the greed envoy. Greed has two kinds: one with power, one without power. Those with power take by force, like foxes and wolves; those without power only beg for coarse and base, like jackals. Below "chewing" it clarifies greed taking objects, drawing things toward oneself like "chewing"; not using the proper principle is like "trampling." The greedy mind takes objects: sometimes taking one city, sometimes one country; when it has boundaries it is like "gnawing." It is also said: greed taking objects has use and non-use; taking with use [16] is like "chewing," taking without use is like "trampling"; also little is chewing, much is trampling. "Bones and flesh strewn" means accumulating the five dusts without knowing sufficiency. "Therefore packs of dogs compete to seize" means this is powerful greed, seizing from the powerless, namely kings and bandits. "Hungry, emaciated, and frightened" means always not knowing sufficiency like hunger; seeking and not obtaining like emaciation; variously searching like fright. A person of many desires, though rich, is poor. Love-mind greed greedily takes the flesh of the five dusts; view-mind greed greedily takes the bones of principle. Pushing to seek knowledge and views thus produces many explanations, which are many bones; dogs that need bones compete to seize them. In the minds of various views, not yet obtaining the food of the correct Dharma is called hunger; not being able to subdue and cut off views is called emaciation; seeking explanations everywhere is called fright. One says: this is simply the greedy person's longing and hoping.

"Fighting and dragging," fifth, two phrases, parables the doubt envoy. Hesitating between two sides is called doubt; not deciding right and wrong is fighting; the mind thinks it is right and is called dragging; it again thinks it is wrong and is called pulling. "Gnashing, snarling, howling, and barking" is speaking and debating the principles of right and wrong. The two phrases "fear and terror," second, conclude the five blunt envoys above.

### 3. The Five Sharp Envoys (Lines 50-60)

<div class="chinese-source">
「處處皆有」下，第二，有十行，明五利[17]使。為二：初半行，總明利使，利使遍緣五陰四諦，下故言「處處皆有」。夫鬼神有通有智，禽獸則無，故以利使譬鬼神，鈍使喻[18]蟲獸。「夜叉」下，第二，九行半，別明五利使。為五：初三行，明夜叉，是捷疾鬼，譬邪見撥無因果，人是善報，譬出世因果不雜煩惱；撥無此理，如食人肉也。毒[＊15-2]蟲之屬是惡報，如世間因果雜諸煩惱，撥無此理，如噉毒[＊15-3]蟲之屬也。「孚乳產生」者，世間之法從自類因生自類果也。「各自藏護」者，因能有果名藏，必得不失名護也。又人肉是善，毒[＊15-4]蟲是惡，邪見之心，撥無善惡因果，事如噉食也。「孚乳產生」，總說善惡並有因果相生之用也。「食之既飽」者，見心成就也。「惡心[19]熾盛」者，見心增廣也。「鬪諍之聲」者，內心成就、外彰言教，宣於無因無果之法，能令聞者墮落三途，故言怖畏也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Below "Everywhere there are," second, there are ten lines, clarifying the five sharp [17] envoys. It has two: first, half a line, generally clarifying sharp envoys. Sharp envoys pervasively condition the five aggregates[^33] and the four noble truths[^34]; therefore it says "everywhere there are." Ghosts and spirits have penetrations and knowledge; birds and beasts do not. Therefore the sharp envoys are parabled by ghosts and spirits, and the blunt envoys are compared to [18] insects and beasts. Below "yaksa," second, nine and a half lines, separately clarifies the five sharp envoys, in five parts. First, three lines: it clarifies yaksa, swift ghosts, parabling wrong views that deny cause and effect. Humans are good retribution, parabling supramundane cause and effect not mixed with afflictions; denying this principle is like eating human flesh. Poisonous [*15-2] insects are evil retribution, like worldly cause and effect mixed with various afflictions; denying this principle is like eating poisonous [*15-3] insects. "Nursing and producing" means worldly dharmas give rise to their own kind of fruit from causes of the same kind. "Each stores and protects" means causes can produce fruit, called storing; necessarily obtaining and not losing is called protecting. Again, human flesh is good, poisonous [*15-4] insects are evil; the mind of wrong views denies good and evil causes and effects, the matter is like eating. "Nursing and producing" generally states that good and evil both have the function of causes and fruits arising together. "When it has eaten and is full" means the view-mind is accomplished. "Evil mind [19] blazing" means the view-mind expands. "The sound of fighting" means the inner mind is accomplished and outwardly manifests in words and teachings, proclaiming a doctrine of no cause and no fruit, able to make hearers fall into the three evil paths; therefore it is called terrifying.

「鳩槃[20]茶」下，第二，兩行二句，譬戒取。鳩槃[＊20-1]茶是鬼勝者，如有漏善能[21]勝諸[＊15-5]蟲也。「蹲踞土埵」者，修十善戒能生六天，六天是欲界高處，事如土埵也。又外道持戒能修禪定，初得欲界定，或得未來[22]定，未來[＊22-1]定未脫欲界，欲界之頂如土埵也。「或離一尺二尺」者，得色界定如一尺，得無色處定如二尺，得升上界為「往」，退墮為「反」，起見蓋如「縱逸嬉戲」。「捉狗兩足」，一云，謗無苦因如捉狗足，撥無苦果如脚加頸，集本得果如狗之聲，利見撥言無集無得苦之理，令其失聲也。觀解者，修六行觀伏貪，貪不行似[1]如被斷為失聲；狗是欲貪，兩足為覺觀，覺觀往還常在貪境，數息止心[2]是能縛義，為捉覺觀也。撲者，貪覺若強向不淨境，作不淨觀伏貪覺，貪覺摧伏，如狗被撲因不能聲。又云，作不淨觀如撲狗，能生禪定如被撲[3]失聲也。「脚加頸」者，如狗雖被撲，擾動不伏，更以脚加；貪雖知不淨止，貪猶未甚靜，更以無常觀脚，加保常之頸則生怖畏，則貪覺不起也。又云，一往制心如向地撲；常繫在緣，如脚加頸令不得起也；「怖狗自樂」者，以修無常覺悟貪心，如怖狗，因得禪味名自樂也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Below "kumbhanda," second, two lines and two phrases, parables precept-grasping. Kumbhanda [*20-1] is the superior among ghosts; it is like defiled good that can [21] overcome various [*15-5] insects. "Squatting on an earthen mound" means practicing the ten wholesome precepts[^35] can be born in the six heavens; the six heavens are high places in the desire realm, the matter is like an earthen mound. Also outsiders who keep precepts can cultivate dhyana; they first attain desire-realm samadhi, or attain the future [22] samadhi; the future [*22-1] samadhi has not left the desire realm; the top of the desire realm is like an earthen mound. "Some are one foot or two feet away" means attaining form-realm samadhi is like one foot, attaining formless-realm samadhi is like two feet; ascending to the higher realm is called "going," falling back is called "returning"; arising view-coverings is like "indulgent play." "Grabbing a dog by both legs": one says that slandering there is no cause of suffering is like grabbing the dog's legs; denying there is no fruit of suffering is like adding a foot to its neck; when the cause gathers it obtains fruit like the dog's sound; sharp views deny there is no cause and no attainment of suffering, causing it to lose its voice. For contemplative explanation: practicing the six practices to subdue greed—when greed does not function it is like being cut off and losing voice. The dog is desire-greed; the two legs are initial and sustained thought; initial and sustained thought go back and forth and are always in greedy objects. Counting the breath and stopping the mind [2] has the meaning of binding; this is grabbing initial and sustained thought. "Striking" means: if the greedy thought strongly turns toward an impure object, one makes the impure contemplation to subdue greedy thought; the greedy thought is subdued, like a dog struck and unable to bark. It is also said: making the impure contemplation is like striking a dog; being able to produce dhyana is like being struck [3] and losing voice. "Adding a foot to the neck" means: although the dog has been struck, it still stirs and is not subdued, so one adds a foot. Although greed knows to stop in the impure, it is still not very quiet; further using contemplation of impermanence as the foot, adding it to the neck of preserving permanence then produces fear, and greedy thought does not arise. It is also said: one push to control the mind is like striking toward the ground; constantly tying it to the object is like adding a foot to the neck so it cannot rise. "Frightening the dog and taking joy" means: by cultivating impermanence one awakens the greedy mind; like frightening a dog, one then gains the taste of dhyana and is called self-joy.

「其身長大」下，第三，一行半偈，譬身見。豎入三世計我名「長」，橫遍五陰計我名「大」，計我自在不修善法，即無慚愧故言「裸形」，以惡莊嚴故言「黑」，無功德資故言「瘦」。計我者不出三界，故言「常住其中」。計我在心，發言宣說有我之相，故言「發大惡聲」。冀因此說望得道果，故言「叫呼求食」也。

Below "its body is long and large," third, one and a half gatha, parables self-view. Vertically entering the three times and counting "self" is called "long"; horizontally pervading the five aggregates and counting "self" is called "large." Counting self as自在 and not cultivating good dharmas means no shame or conscience, thus "naked form"; adorning with evil, thus "black"; lacking merit as resources, thus "thin." Those who count a self do not exit the three realms, therefore it says "always dwelling within." Counting self in the mind, they speak and proclaim the appearance of a self, therefore it says "making a great evil sound." Hoping by this speech to obtain the fruit of the path, therefore it says "crying out and seeking food."

<div class="english-translation">
Below "the head is like an ox head," fifth, two lines, parables extreme views. Pushing the self to cessation and permanence, the two extremes of cessation and permanence are like the two horns of an ox head. "The body is self" [4] and "self is the body"—extreme views arise based on self-view like the two horns of the head. The faults of counting permanence and cessation can cut off supramundane good, like eating human flesh. They can cut off worldly good roots, like "sometimes [5] eating dogs." Sometimes they count permanence, sometimes count cessation, turning back and forth like "hair disheveled." Counting permanence breaks cessation; counting cessation breaks permanence, like "cruel and dangerous." With no wisdom or samadhi, they sustain themselves on food and drink, like being "pressed by hunger and thirst."

Below "yaksa and hungry ghosts," second, one and a half lines, generally concludes the appearance of desire-realm afflictions, and also concludes the appearance of beings purely of sharp afflictions. Both are minds with outflows, always without the flavor of the Way, therefore it says "hungry and urgent." "[6] Peering through a window" clarifies that their wrong contemplation of emptiness longs for the flavor of the Way; though they observe, they still cling, the mind mostly does not grasp correct principle—like peering through a window and seeing empty space without gaining unimpededness.

Below “At that time the householder stood outside the door,” there are thirty‑two and a half lines of gāthā, versifying the second specific parable. The specific parable has four; now the verses only versify three: first there are two and a half lines, versifying the elder seeing the fire; second, thirteen lines, versifying the parable of discarding the bench and using carts—stopping the great and giving the small; third, seventeen lines, versifying the parable of bestowing the great cart. The first two and a half lines that versify seeing the fire have three: (1) the one who can see, (2) what is seen, (3) arousing alarm and fear; all are included here. First, below “householder,” the three phrases are the one who can see. Above it clarified “seeing”; now it says “hearing,” using hearing in place of seeing—hearing must come from another. “Standing outside the door” directly versifies the above: “Though I can safely exit through the burning door.” “Standing” means: in the dharmakāya ground[^36] he constantly harbors great compassion[^42], wishing to save beings, and does not sit on the seat of ultimate‑meaning emptiness[^37]. The old explanation says: the Buddhas of the ten directions told Śākyamuni, “You have connected sons in the three realms[^5]; their good roots are about to be extinguished.” It also says: beings’ responsiveness to the Buddha is “another person.” Now we say: the Dharma is the Buddha’s teacher—namely the samādhi dharma[^38]; this Dharma is the teacher, namely “another person” [2]. If one enters samādhi one can see the capacity; samādhi enables the Buddha to see, therefore it says “someone said.” It also says: great compassion is the “other person” (etc.). Below “You sons, etc.,” second, one line and one phrase, it versifies the fire that is seen.

Also, principle‑nature is originally pure and is not a dharma of the three realms; because of ignorance[^39] it gives rise to proliferative discourse[^40], and then there is birth‑and‑death[^41]. Therefore it says, “first, because of play, they came in.”

Below “Just appropriately rescue,” second, thirteen lines, it versifies discarding the bench and using carts; it has two: first there are five and a half lines, versifying above “unable to rescue the sons.” In the opening parable there are exhortation and admonition; in the combining only exhortation is combined; now it only versifies admonition. The admonition text has three; here it also clarifies three: first four and a half gāthā versify the above “I should speak of fear and propose appropriately”; next, below “the sons are unknowing,” second, three phrases, versify not receiving the admonition; “playing without end,” third, one phrase, directly versifies stopping the transformation. “Appropriately propose” means proposing the great teaching. “Admonish and instruct” means speaking of the many dangers to admonish and teach. The single phrase about “not ending” versifies the above “only looking at the father,” the meaning of letting go of bitter words.

Now the verse has only three meanings, and it omits versifying “knowing the sons’ prior minds.” The first three lines versify proposing appropriately; below “telling the sons,” second, three gāthā [3] exhort and praise the rarity of the three carts.

Below “hearing of such carts,” third, one and a half gāthā versifies fitting the sons’ wishes.

Below “Telling Śāriputra, I am also like this,” second, thirty‑four and a half lines, this is the verse that combines the parable. The first four lines verse the combined general parable; it only makes four meanings and thereby also attains six parables. “I am also like this,” one line, verses the combined elder: the upper half verses the combined rank and title; the lower half verses the combined name and conduct and also praises the virtue‑meaning. [He is] honored among the sages of the seven kinds of expedients[^45], the father of the nine kinds of worlds[^46]. “All living beings are my sons,” one gāthā, verses the combined five paths[^22], and by meaning also includes the thirty sons. The thirty sons are children of the conditioned cause[^47]; all living beings are precisely children of the proper cause[^47]. “The three realms[^5] have no peace,” half a gāthā, verses the combined house‑and‑dwelling, and also attains the meaning of the one door. “Many sufferings fill [it],” one and a half gāthā, verses the combined arising of the fire.

Below “Although I nevertheless teach and instruct,” second, four lines, it verses the parable of discarding the bench and using carts, in two: the first one line verses discarding the bench, etc. In the opening parable there are three—proposing appropriately, no capacity, and ceasing the transformation; now this one gāthā also has three meanings, but in a general abridgment. The phrase “Although I nevertheless teach and instruct” verses proposing appropriately; the phrase “yet they do not believe and accept” verses no capacity; the next two phrases [1] verse ceasing the transformation; or it could be that the next two verse no capacity. “Because craving and attachment are deep [2]” verses the above “not yet avoiding birth, aging, sickness, death, sorrow, grief, suffering, [3] vexation, etc.” Below “By these expedient means”[^45], second, three gāthā, it verses the combined parable of using carts to rescue the sons and obtain [them]. Above there are four; now it only verses three; the combining also is three, and it omits combining “knowing the sons’ prior minds.” First, the phrase “by these expedient means” verses the above “only using wisdom‑expedients to propose appropriately”; from “to speak the three vehicles” below, [4] second, one line and one phrase, verses the combined above third “praising the rarity of the three carts”; below “these sons, etc.” third, one line and a half, verses the combined fourth “fitting their wishes.” Above, in the combining, each of the three vehicles has four phrases; now it generally verses them. “If the mind is determined” means: from the dharma‑patience with respect to suffering[^48] and above is true determination; this one phrase generally verses the stage of running of the three vehicles[^21]; afterward, the line below “complete” separately verses the stage of scrambling to get out of the three vehicles [*5‑1].

In the combined equal bestowal above there are four; it does not verse two of them. Now the combination is again abridged: it only combines the two chapter‑gates and the third, the vast great cart.

Next, below “If you are able,” second, one line, verses the combined chapter‑gate of equal mind; above it says these beings have escaped the three realms[^5]. Next, below “This vehicle is subtle,” third, two lines, verses the combined proper vast great cart; above it says all are of one mark and one kind, etc. Next, below “Immeasurable hundreds of thousands of millions of powers and liberations,” fourth, one line, this verses the above reason for having the cart.

Below “Obtaining such a vehicle,” second, three gāthā, it verses obtaining the cart and rejoicing. Within this there are again two: the first two gāthā clarify that each obtains the great cart; later, below “By these causes and conditions,” second, one gāthā, concludes by exhorting faith. Now in the first two gāthā, “day and night” means: at first one attains the Buddha‑knowledge‑and‑vision[^49]; the middle‑way wisdom‑light[^50] is like the daylight, and ignorance[^39] is like the night. One’s own attaining of middle‑way wisdom is like day; great compassion entering birth‑and‑death is like night. Because one constantly practices the two dharmas, it is called “play.” People of the three vehicles[^21] enter together into Buddha‑wisdom, therefore it says “together with the bodhisattvas[^51] and the assembly of śrāvakas[^52].” This also clarifies self‑practice and transforming others: oneself obtains this vehicle, therefore it says “day and night play”; by this one transforms others, therefore it says “together with the bodhisattvas and the assembly of śrāvakas.” Being able to transform the three vehicles, it is “together riding the jeweled vehicle.”

He says: if bodhisattvas[^51] do not ask for the cart, by what cause do they rejoice in riding the cart?

Below “Telling Śāriputra, you people, etc.,” fourth, there are fifteen and a half lines of gāthā, it verses the above fourth combined parable of “not false.” Above, the combining has two: first it raises two parables, then it combines “not false”; now it only verses the combined “not false.” The text is two: first three and a half lines directly verse the combined “not false” chapter‑gate; next, below “if there are bodhisattvas,” second, twelve gāthā, verse the combined explanation of “not false”—Śāriputra makes the parable of matching the original intent being not false. The father originally wished to let the sons get out of difficulty, therefore he set up three carts; once they had escaped difficulty, even to the point of not giving the small cart, he also did not violate the earlier intent—therefore it is not false. When the Buddha verses this parable, it clarifies “not false”; it clarifies that the Buddha’s original intent was precisely to speak the one [vehicle], but because of the five turbidities[^28] they would not believe and accept, he therefore spoke the three; once the turbid obstacles are removed he returns to speak the one great [vehicle], which then matches the original intent. Now first, the chapter‑gate is three: first one line, first determines father and sons, clarifying that originally he wished to give the great [vehicle], therefore the text says “all are my sons,” and in principle he should equally give the great [vehicle]. Next, below “you all,” second, one gāthā, clarifies that speaking the three vehicles[^21] was in order to remove obstacles, therefore it says you all are burned by many sufferings through cumulative kalpas. Next, below “I though previously,” third, one and a half lines: since the obstacles are already removed, he returns to carry out the original intent and give the Great Vehicle Dharma, therefore it says “what should now be done is only Buddha‑wisdom.”

</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Below “if there are bodhisattvas,” second, twelve lines, it verses the combined explanation, again explaining the previous three meanings. The first two gāthā explain that all alike are sons and should be equally [treated]; next, below “if people have small wisdom,” second, seven gāthā, it explains that because they cannot receive, he therefore speaks the three vehicles; next, below “actually not yet,” third, there are three gāthā, explaining that afterward, if they can bear it, he returns to give them the great [vehicle]. Now in the first two lines, “if there are bodhisattvas” means: the beings transformed by the expedients of the three vehicles are all Buddha‑sons who in former days formed affinities, and all alike possess suchness‑Buddha‑nature[^54]; therefore it says they are all bodhisattvas. Below “if people have small wisdom,” second, seven lines, it clarifies that small wisdom has heavy obstacles and does not immediately believe and accept, so by expedient means he opens the three to guide the small‑wisdom. “To speak of the truth of suffering” means: the śrāvaka[^52] is the smallest among the three vehicles; again he takes the truth of suffering as the first gate. “Beings’ minds rejoice” means: matching their former habits they rejoice; originally they detest birth‑and‑death and seek nirvāṇa, and now hearing of leaving [saṃsāra], they meet their former habits and therefore rejoice. Here it directly clarifies the constructed Four Noble Truths[^55]. “Only departing from falsehood” means: ignorance[^39] is already unreal; the universal afflictions attach to ignorance and arise, therefore they are called “falsehood.” The constructed Four Truths only remove these afflictions and are called “liberation”; they are freed from segmental [birth‑and‑death] but not yet from transformational [birth‑and‑death], therefore they are not自在.

Below “actually not yet obtained,” third, three gāthā, it explains that once the obstacles are removed and the faculties are again sharp, he returns to carry out the original intent and give the Great Vehicle Dharma. The Buddha originally wished to give all liberation; now you have only begun to cut off segmental [birth‑and‑death][^56], this is not Great Nirvāṇa[^57]. Because you have not yet obtained everything, in the end it still does not match the original intent; therefore it says, “My intent is not to make [you] reach extinction.” Now he again causes [them] to obtain the unsurpassed path[^58] and enter Great Nirvāṇa[^57]; this is ultimately matching the Buddha’s original intent. All liberation is precisely the unconstructed cessation truth[^59]; the unsurpassed path is precisely the unconstructed path truth[^59]. He uses the two truths[^60] to break the unconstructed suffering‑and‑accumulation; formerly he wished to speak this but [6] these beings were not capable; once the obstacles are removed he again speaks this. The Buddha is the Dharma‑king; with respect to provisional and real dharmas he already has mastery[^61]; opening the three and revealing the one real, how could there be falsity?

Below “You, Śāriputra, this Dharma‑seal of mine,”[^62] [7] sixth, fifteen lines of gāthā, it exhorts faith and propagation. “Faith” means believing in what the Buddha speaks and does not speak; “exhortation” means exhorting what can be passed on and what cannot; because there are these two meanings [8], it is called “exhorting faith.” The text has two: (1) marking the two chapters, (2) explanation. First, one line marks the “speaking / not speaking” chapter: the Tathāgata speaks this Dharma‑seal in order to benefit the world; “not speaking” means that for more than forty years it was not the time to speak, and because the five thousand had not yet departed, therefore he did not speak. Next, below “in the places [1] he roams,” the half‑line marks the “can pass / cannot pass” chapter: do not recklessly propagate. For evil people, to forcefully speak causes them to fall into suffering; for good people, not speaking wrongly makes them lose joy. If with great compassion one pities the evil, one therefore does not pass [it on]; if with great kindness one thinks of the good, one should pass [it on]. This is called marking the “can pass / cannot pass” chapter.

From “if there are those who hear,” this is the second, the explanation; it is again two: first eight lines explain what can be spoken and what cannot be spoken; second, fifty and a half lines explain what can be passed on and what cannot be passed on. Now the first eight lines clarify the Tathāgata’s manner of benefiting the world. It generally discusses benefits across the three times, and separately discusses enabling the two vehicles[^21] to enter faith. “Avinivartaniya”[^63] is observing the present benefit; “formerly seen” is observing the past benefit and speaking for it. “Believing you and me” is observing the future benefit and speaking for it; the text below says, “If one deeply believes and understands, one sees the Buddha constantly abiding at Vulture Peak,”[^64] which is precisely its meaning. This *Lotus Sūtra*[^65] one line [2] concludes what is above and opens what is below: the Tathāgata observes and knows the three‑time benefits, therefore he speaks; if shallow wisdom does not understand, he does not speak. This explains the Tathāgata’s “speaking / not speaking” chapter [3].

<div class="english-translation">
From “arrogant and lazy”[^66] below, it explains the chapter on whether practitioners [4] can or cannot be passed [the Dharma]; it is again two. First, thirty‑six and a half lines: it clarifies that if one uses the gate of great compassion[^42], one must not speak to the evil—first list the evil kinds; they will surely arouse evil slander and obtain evil retribution; therefore, by great compassion one must not speak [to them]. “Cutting off the worldly Buddha‑seed” means: the *Vimalakīrti Sūtra*[^69] takes afflictions[^67] as the Tathāgata‑seed[^68]; this takes the nature of objects/realm. The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra*[^70] takes the wisdom of all modes[^71] as learning prajñā[^72]; this takes the illuminating‑cause nature[^73] as the Buddha‑seed. The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*[^74] uses mind‑nature‑principle as not cut off; this takes the proper‑cause nature[^47] as the Buddha‑seed. This sūtra clarifies that small good [deeds] become Buddhahood; this takes the conditioned cause[^47] as the Buddha‑seed. If one does not believe that small good becomes Buddhahood, one then cuts off the worldly Buddha‑seed. Below “if there are those of sharp faculties,” nineteen lines, it explains that when propagating the sūtra one uses the gate of great kindness[^75]; good people should be taught so they do not lose joy. The essentials of propagation are to harmonize the two gates and make them obtain their proper place; this is good transmission. If they do not obtain their proper place, that is reckless propagation. The text is two: the first seventeen lines have five pairs and ten marks of good people who can be taught; the latter two lines conclude that they should be spoken to. First, past/present as one pair: “sharp faculties” is present; “[6] planted good” [7] is past; “strong memory” is present; “seeing a hundred thousand” is past. Second, above/below as one pair: “cultivating kindness” is pitying below; “reverent” is honoring above. Third, inner/outer as one pair: “abandoning evil and drawing near good” is seeking outward; “holding precepts like pearls” is guarding inward. Fourth, self‑practice and transforming others as one pair: “upright and revering the Buddha” is self‑practice; “speaking Dharma by parables” is transforming others. Fifth, beginning/end as one pair: “seeking Dharma in the four directions” is the beginning of requesting benefit; “receiving at the crown and exclusively cultivating” is the end of reliance (etc.). Below “Telling Śāriputra,” two lines, it concludes. There are many good believers; it briefly raises ten marks to show the methods of propagation, revealing the main essentials of the two gates of compassion—what can be passed on and what cannot. [8]

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
有人言，信解三法，謂一往化、隨逐化、畢竟化，昔說大為一往，背大後為隨逐，父子相見為畢竟。[10]又人天善為一往，說小乘齊法華為隨逐，說法華得記為畢竟。又初說二乘為一往，轉教為隨逐，法華為畢竟。又轉教為一往，歷方等為隨逐，悟一乘為畢竟。又說《法華》為一往，十地常教化為隨逐，至金剛心為畢竟。又結僧那為一往，中間為隨逐，得佛為畢竟。私謂諸解重疊，玉屑非寶，夫一往非本懷，畢竟是宗極，說人天、二乘為一往，可非本懷，昔為說大今說《法華》，[11]箇是畢竟那稱一往？若《法華》畢竟而更成一往，人天一往還成畢竟，則大顛倒。又二乘是一往，草庵須破；昔大為一往，繫珠亦須破。若一破一不破，一是一往、一非一往。又父子相見是畢竟者，前畢竟應悟一，則後畢竟無復用；若後畢竟乃悟一，前畢竟非畢竟。節節有妨，今皆不用。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Some say there are three dharmas of “belief and understanding”: one‑time transformation[^77], following transformation[^77], and ultimate transformation[^77]. Formerly speaking the Great [Vehicle] is the one‑time; afterward turning away from the Great is the following; the father and son meeting is the ultimate. [10] Moreover, human‑and‑heaven good[^78] is the one‑time; speaking the Small Vehicle to match the *Lotus Sūtra*[^65] is the following; speaking the *Lotus* and receiving prediction[^80] is the ultimate. Moreover, initially speaking the two vehicles[^79] is the one‑time; turning‑teaching[^81] is the following; the *Lotus* is the ultimate. Moreover, turning‑teaching is the one‑time; passing through the Vaipulya teachings[^82] is the following; awakening the One Vehicle[^53] is the ultimate. Moreover, saying the *Lotus* is the one‑time; the ten bhūmis’ constant teaching[^83] is the following; reaching the diamond‑mind[^84] is the ultimate. Moreover, “jiesengna”[^85] is the one‑time; the middle [stage] is the following; attaining Buddhahood is the ultimate. I privately say these explanations overlap; jade dust is not treasure. The one‑time is not the original intent; the ultimate is the doctrinal summit. Saying humans‑and‑heavens and the two vehicles are the one‑time is surely not the original intent. Formerly he spoke the Great; now he speaks the *Lotus*—[11] this is the ultimate; how can it be called the one‑time? If the *Lotus* is ultimate and yet becomes the one‑time, then the human‑and‑heaven one‑time becomes ultimate, which is a great inversion. Moreover, if the two vehicles are the one‑time, the “grass‑hut” must be broken; if the former Great is the one‑time, the “tied pearl” must also be broken.[^86] If one is broken and one is not broken, one is one‑time and one is not one‑time. Moreover, if the father and son meeting is the ultimate, the earlier ultimate should be awakening to the one; then the later ultimate has no further use. If the later ultimate is when one awakens to the one, the earlier ultimate is not ultimate. At each step there is obstruction; now all are not used.

<div class="english-translation">
Some say this chapter is Trace[^87]. Why? The Tathāgata attained the Way long ago; even the intermediate pause is also trace. I privately say: in principle that is so, but in the text it is not fitting. Why? The Buddha has not yet spoken of origin‑and‑trace; how could one prematurely take it? If they have not yet understood the three vehicles[^21], they should already have awakened to the One Vehicle[^53] (etc.). Now, to explain the chapter: roots have sharp and blunt; defilements have thick and thin; the teaching has Dharma and parable; realization has earlier and later. Before the Lotus seat they were like peas; the text says, “The Tathāgata has spoken the Dharma for a long time; at that time, sitting in the assembly, my body was weary and slack; I only thought of emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness[^88], and toward the Bodhisattva‑Dharma I did not have a single thought of delight.” At first, hearing the brief explanation stirred attachment and gave rise to doubt; hearing broadly of the five Buddhas[^89] they were fogged and did not understand; now, hearing the parable, they rejoice and leap; faith arises, understanding is born, doubt departs, principle becomes clear. Rejoicing is the Worldly Siddhānta, faith arising is the Individual Siddhānta, doubt departing is the Therapeutic Siddhānta, and principle becoming clear is the First‑Principle Siddhānta[^90]. By these causes and conditions, it is called the “Belief and Understanding” chapter. Receiving the small and great teachings[^92], at first they [12] transform from ordinary to sage, each with its own successive stages. For the Small Vehicle, the faith‑practice person[^91] produces understanding from hearing; when the dharma‑patience of suffering[^48] becomes manifest, the arising of faith is called “practice.” The dharma‑practice person[^91] observes the Dharma through the stages; when the dharma‑patience of suffering becomes manifest, the arising of Dharma is called “practice.” If one is a faith‑practice person, upon entering the path of cultivation[^93] one is renamed “belief and understanding”; if one is a dharma‑practice person, upon entering the path of cultivation one is renamed “seeing and attaining.” Taking the small to view the great, it should also be like this. Those of middle roots[^95], hearing the parable, first break doubt and enter the Great Vehicle path of seeing[^93], therefore it is named “faith”; entering the Great Vehicle path of cultivation[^93], therefore it is named “understanding.” The text says, “The unsurpassed treasure‑collection is obtained without seeking; today we are truly śrāvakas[^52].” By the Buddha‑way sound he causes all to hear; hearing the perfect teaching and entering the perfect stage[^94], therefore it is called the “Belief and Understanding” chapter. As for origin and trace: the four great disciples have long entered the Great Vehicle and accomplished Buddha‑dharma; by trace he leads the middle‑rooted and shows initial belief and understanding; therefore it is called the “Belief and Understanding” chapter.

</div>
<div class="english-translation">
This is the section of receiving‑understanding: nearby it receives the burning‑house [parable], and distantly it receives the expedients[^45]. The text is two: (1) the sūtra narrator narrates rejoicing; (2) addressing the Buddha [13], they self‑report. First it narrates the inner mind, next it narrates the outer reverence. Subhūti alone is called “Wisdom‑Life”[^96]. As for the three who are Mahā[^97]: generally speaking all are great and all have wisdom; specifically, Subhūti understands emptiness, and emptiness‑wisdom is his life—this is in terms of practice. Among all wise persons, Buddha‑wisdom is foremost. In the *Prajñā*[^72] [sūtra], the Buddha commands him to turn the teaching; because he is commanded by the wise, therefore [14] it is called “Wisdom‑Life.” The three disciples were commanded less; they do not take emptiness as the basis of practice—this is in terms of teaching. “Mahā” is as explained above (etc.). The reason for joy: in the distance they heard the expedient five‑section Dharma‑teaching; the sūtra narrator only narrates two kinds—hearing the rare Dharma and hearing the prediction[^80]. It may be that “hearing the rare Dharma” narrates four sections, and “seeing the prediction” is the fifth section. Thus hearing and seeing what was previously never; this is the reason for joy. “Arousing the rare mind” means: narrating that upon recently hearing the four rounds of the parable‑explanations, a rare mind arises; because the mind arises, it is named “faith.” Because of faith one enters; entering the stage of joy—this is precisely the meaning of the “Belief and Understanding” chapter. “Rising from the seat” narrates outer reverence, as in the text. By example of Śāriputra, it should also be the three karmas[^98] receiving understanding; following earlier, it can be explained. Below “Addressing the Buddha,” by mouth they self‑report. The text is two: first, the long‑prose and seventy‑three and a half gāthā[^1] directly state the obtained understanding; second, thirteen gāthā praise the Buddha’s deep恩. This understanding comes from the Buddha; therefore first state, then praise.

The long‑prose[^2] again has two: first, brief Dharma exposition; second, broad exposition by parable. The brief again has two: Dharma exposition and briefly raising the parable. The Dharma exposition again has two: first clarifying that formerly, because they received the three [vehicles], they did not seek; second clarifying that now, because they understand the One, they obtain it of themselves. Within “not seeking” there is a heading and an explanation. The heading is three: (1) because they are at the head of the sangha[^100], (2) because worldly age is advanced, (3) because they have attained [realization]. First, “because at the head of the sangha”: my Dharma years[^99] are already high; later students take me as their model. If I were suddenly to change the path and alter the tracks, abandoning the small and seeking the great, I would be disliked by those who come after; I therefore firmly guard them; therefore I do not seek. Second, worldly age is already advanced: if I were to become a bodhisattva[^51], I should take on the great path and broadly ferry beings; now I am already old and decayed, with nothing I can bear or undertake; therefore I do not seek. Third, I have already attained nirvāṇa[^103], the unconditioned proper position[^101]; I cannot arouse the great mind. On high plateau and dry land lotuses do not grow; the knowledge of exhaustion and the knowledge of non‑arising[^102] are already established; there is nothing to rely on in seeking.

<div class="english-translation">
Why is that? Explaining the three “not‑seeking” [reasons]: the text is not in order. First it explains “attaining nirvāṇa[^103] and not seeking”; next it explains “age advanced,” which also includes “head of the sangha”[^100]; or it refers to the earlier statement that the Dharma has long been spoken and the mind does not rejoice. Explaining “not seeking because one is head of the sangha”: since it says “sitting in the assembly” and again says “age is old,” we know it is explaining the head of the sangha. Explaining “not seeking” is as in the text.

Below “we now before the Buddha,” it states the reason for obtaining understanding: because from afar they heard the five sections[^105], briefly and broadly, opening the three and revealing the real[^104]; therefore they rejoice. “Obtaining great good benefit” means directly stating the obtained understanding: this is that recently, hearing the rare Dharma of the four rounds of parables[^106], they obtained awakening; the benefit of awakening is good benefit. Below “immeasurable treasures,” second, it briefly raises the parable: it likens that formerly they did not seek, but now they themselves obtain the rare Dharma‑treasure.

From “World‑Honored One, we delight to speak parables” below, this is the broad receiving‑understanding. It has opening‑parable and combining‑parable; wishing to open, first consult and arouse (etc.). The parables are five: (1) from “abandoning the father and fleeing away” below, named the parable of father and son losing each other; near it receives the burning‑house general parable, far it receives the expedients[^45] in brief verse. (2) From “the poor son hires himself out” below, named the parable of father and son seeing each other; near it receives the burning‑house seeing‑the‑fire [parable], far it receives the expedients: “I, with the Buddha‑eye, see.” (3) From “[1] immediately dispatches someone to urgently chase and bring back” below, named the parable of chasing and luring; near it receives the burning‑house discarding the bench and using carts, far it receives the expedients: withholding the great and giving the small. (4) From “after this the minds mutually trust” below, named the parable of fully knowing the household business; this does not receive the near/far above, but rather pursues the intent of Vaipulya admonition[^82] and the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā* turning‑teaching[^70]. (5) From “[2] again after [3] a short time the father knows the son’s intent” below, named the parable of bequeathing the household business; near it receives the burning‑house giving one great cart, far it receives the Dharma‑exposition’s “directly abandoning expedients” [4]. Moreover, combining the fourth and fifth together makes one parable of receiving and entrusting; below its meaning is explained again. Formerly, using the Western Infinite‑Life Buddha[^107] to combine with the elder, now we do not use it. The Western Buddha is distinct and the conditions are different: because the Buddhas are distinct, the meaning of concealment and revelation[^112] does not stand; because the conditions are different, the meaning of father and son does not stand. Moreover, at the beginning and end of this sūtra there is entirely no such intent—this is drilling and chiseling with eyes closed. Now, relying on the text and attaching the meaning: if explaining the poor son, take the two‑vehicle people[^79] and use the half‑character Dharma[^108] to interpret the text; if explaining the elder, take the Lushena Buddha[^109] and use the full‑character Dharma‑gate[^108] to interpret the text. Why? The elder inside the house removes [6] necklaces and puts on dirty clothing; the clothing’s [*6‑1] necklaces differ, but the person [7] is just one. This is a parable: the Lushena Buddha hides immeasurable divine virtues and shows a sixteen‑foot golden radiance[^110], holding the dung‑vessel[^111] and setting up the three‑vehicle teaching[^21]. Concealing and revealing differ; how could there be a difference of body? Even nearby, the wearing and removing of Śe‑na are not yet understood; [A3] Amitābha is far away—how could he change (etc.)?

## VI. DETAILED PARABLE: PART 1 - LOSING AND SEEKING (Lines 161-200; CBETA 006:161–200)

### 1. The Son Leaving the Father (Lines 161-170)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
問：

佛捨應後眾生起惑，是父離子，非是子捨父。

答：

由眾生不感佛則去世，還成子捨父義。

「久住他國」者，涅槃法界是佛自國，生死五欲是為他國，本求出離而退墮不[16]反，故云「久住」。「或十」是天道，「二十」人道，「五十」是五道，約於一人備輪諸道。

<div class="english-translation">
**Question:** After the Buddha discards the Response Body[^113], sentient beings give rise to delusion; this is the Father leaving the Son, not the Son abandoning the Father.  
**Answer:** Because sentient beings do not resonate/respond[^114] to the Buddha, he departs the world; it thus becomes the meaning of the Son abandoning the Father.  
**“Long dwelling in another land”:** The nirvāṇa‑dharma realm[^103][^115] is the Buddha’s own land; birth‑and‑death with the five desires[^116] is the other land. Originally seeking escape but falling back and not returning, therefore it is called “long dwelling.” “Or ten” is the heavenly path, “twenty” the human path, “fifty” the five paths[^22]; within a single person the revolving of the paths is fully present.

</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Below “year already grown,” second, returning toward the country: “young” has two meanings—first, because ignorance is small; second, because one has not yet encountered suffering, therefore one does not know to return. This is a parable: after forming the connection, great understanding is not yet dense; like ignorance it does not return; still having residual merit, one indulges in delusion and does not return. Now habitual karma secretly perfumes, and one slightly knows to turn toward the Way; encountering suffering and losing joy, one thinks to seek escape. These two become the capacities that knock at the Buddha; therefore it is called “gradually returning toward the father’s country.” The earlier text says, “if people encounter suffering, [the Buddha] speaks nirvāṇa”[^103]; if one takes the two goods of human and heaven as not resonating with the Buddha, then within the three realms[^5] not seeing the Buddha‑father is called “poor,” lacking the method of escape is again “poor,” and being burned by the fire of the eight sufferings[^29] is therefore “distressed.”  
“Rushing in four directions seeking clothing and food”: the old explanation says, the human‑and‑heaven five precepts and ten goods[^117] each have causes and effects, using them as the four directions to provision oneself; moreover, in the four births[^118] one makes a living to seek clothing and food. The later text says, “one hundred thirty kalpas[^121]—only now do I obtain a single meeting”; during those kalpas it is not that there were no human/heaven causes and effects that could not resonate with the Buddha; therefore we know these goods are not the capacity for seeing the Buddha. Now, before the Buddha has appeared, ordinary beings, in body, feelings, mind, and dharmas, give rise to the four views[^119]; within these they seek the right path[^120] as if seeking food, seek the assisting path[^120] as if seeking clothing. Taking weariness of suffering and seeking the principle as a condition for being transformed—when the Buddha first appeared, the various non‑Buddhists were all first to be delivered—this is the meaning. The Great Sūtra[^122] says, “truly contemplating the four directions is a parable of the Four Noble Truths”[^34]; by this one can know.  
“Gradually wandering, meeting toward the original country”: this clarifies that one detests suffering, hopes for release, and wrongly seeks nirvāṇa; although not the original intent, one still meets the Buddha, therefore it says “meeting toward”; the “original country” is as explained above. Below it clarifies how city and house are distinguished: all Buddha‑dharmas are the country—this meaning is broad; “city” speaks of the narrower and more guarded: the nirvāṇa of severance‑virtue, which prevents wrong and wards off evil, is the city; “house” speaks still more intimate: great compassion of the same substance is the house.

### 3. The Father Seeking the Son (Lines 181-197)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「其父先來求子不得」下，第二，求子中止，譬亦為二：初、從退大已後求機不會，不會故名「不得」。二、「中止一城」者，不為一子而廢家業，譬佛不以一處無機而廢餘方施化。舊云，二萬佛後、釋迦佛前，兩楹間為中止。今謂中義可然，止國城家皆不可用。今取方便有餘土為「國」，在同居、實報兩間為「中」，有餘涅槃為「城」，住此涅槃名「止」。處此為家，起勝劣兩應，劣應應聲聞，勝應應菩薩，五人斷通惑者，同生其土皆為菩薩，佛以勝應應之，純以大乘家業訓令修學，中止於此伺覓同居子機，非但中義得合，國城家業皆悉分明。「大富」者，實[2]相境為「家」，具足萬德名為「富」，五度福德名為「財」，般若智慧名為「寶」，導一切悉摩訶衍名「無量」。金銀珠等，是大乘三十七道品也。此即領上長者大富義也。「倉庫盈溢」者，在內為「盈」，在外為「溢」，盛米為「倉」，盛物為「庫」。「倉」譬禪定，禪生百八三昧故。「庫」譬實相，能發十八空智慧故。自資為「盈」，外化為「溢」，領上多有田宅義也。「僮僕」者，方便知見波羅蜜皆悉具足，屈曲隨機稱事稱理，此領上又多僕從。就位為語，二乘及通教菩薩、別教三十心，悉如「僮僕」；別教圓教十地如「臣」，十向如「佐」，十行如「吏」，十住如「民」。初入佛境界，率土之賓無非王民，雖得為民比吏佐等猶為疎遠；十行歷別修習諸法，種種驅馳如吏；十迴向事理稍深，職近王邊如佐；十地輔佛行化，降魔制敵故如臣也。一心三觀如「象」，運圓教大乘；次第三觀如「馬」，運別教大乘；即空析空觀如「牛」，運通教等大乘；析法觀自行如鹿羊等，運二乘之法。「無數」者，權實諸法皆名「車乘」，權實智觀名「象馬牛羊」，非但教法甚多，觀智亦復無數也。「出入」者，二而不二是入，不二而二是出；又不二而二是入，二而不二是出；無量還一是入，一中無量是出；化他用為出，自行用為入。出法益眾生為「息」，化功歸己為「利」。「乃遍他國」者，遍於三土行於非道通達佛道，即其義也，唯法性是己國耳。「商估賈客亦甚眾多」者，諸菩薩是商人，又遍入三土以求法利，故云眾多。此土菩薩往他方聽法，他方大士來此聞經，往還採利也。又應化二身如賈客，將實法遍入三土，化益眾生而歸法身，故云甚多。如世間人令他捉財興生亦自興生也。
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Below “the father previously came seeking the son but did not find him,” second is the seeking‑the‑son and stopping‑in‑the‑middle. The parable also has two: first, after retreating from the Great, he seeks the capacity but does not meet it; not meeting it is therefore called “not finding.” Second, “stopping in a city” means not abandoning the family enterprise for the sake of one son; it is a parable that the Buddha, because one place has no capacity, does not abandon transforming other regions. The old explanation says that after twenty‑thousand Buddhas and before Śākyamuni, the “middle stop” is between the two pillars. Now we say: the “middle” meaning can be so, but “stopping,” “country,” “city,” and “house” cannot be used that way. Now we take the Expedient With‑Remainder Land[^123] as the “country,” the space between the Common Dwelling and Real Reward lands[^124][^125] as the “middle,” the with‑remainder nirvāṇa[^126] as the “city,” and abiding in that nirvāṇa is called “stopping.” Taking this as the house, he raises superior and inferior responses[^127]: the inferior response answers the hearers, the superior response answers the bodhisattvas[^51]. Those five who cut off the shared delusions[^128] are all born in that land and are all bodhisattvas; the Buddha answers them with the superior response, purely training them in the Mahāyāna household enterprise[^139], stopping here in the middle to wait and seek the capacities of sons in the Common Dwelling. Thus not only does the meaning of “middle” fit; the country, city, and household enterprise are all made clear.  
“Great wealth” means: the realm of Real Mark[^142] is the “house”; possessing the myriad virtues is called “wealth”; the merits of the five pāramitās[^140][^141] are called “property”; prajñā wisdom[^72] is called “treasure”; leading all to Mahāyāna[^139] is called “immeasurable.” Gold, silver, and jewels are the thirty‑seven factors of the path[^135]. This is precisely receiving the meaning of the elder’s great wealth above.  
“Granaries and treasuries overflowing” means: inside is “full” and outside is “overflowing”; containing rice is a “granary,” containing goods is a “treasury.” The “granary” is a parable of dhyāna[^143], because dhyāna gives rise to the one‑hundred‑and‑eight samādhis[^38]. The “treasury” is a parable of Real Mark, because it can give rise to the wisdom of the eighteen emptinesses[^136]. Using for oneself is “full,” transforming others is “overflowing,” receiving the meaning above of “having many fields and houses.”  
“Servants” means: the expedient knowledge‑and‑insight pāramitās[^141] are all complete; bending and turning according to the capacity, they fit both affairs and principle—this receives the above “many servants.” Speaking by stage: the two vehicles[^79], the Pervasive‑teaching bodhisattvas, and the Distinct‑teaching thirty minds[^129][^130] are all like “servants”; the Distinct and Perfect teachings’ ten bhūmis[^83][^129][^94] are like “ministers”; the ten dedications[^131] are like “assistants”; the ten practices[^131] are like “clerks”; the ten abodes[^131] are like “citizens.” When first entering the Buddha realm, all under heaven are nothing but royal citizens; though one attains being a citizen, compared to clerks and assistants one is still distant. The ten practices successively cultivate distinct dharmas, variously driving about like clerks; the ten dedications’ affairs and principle are somewhat deep, their offices near the king like assistants; the ten bhūmis assist the Buddha’s transforming activity, subduing Māra and defeating enemies, therefore they are like ministers. One‑mind three contemplations[^132] are like the “elephant,” carrying the Perfect teaching Mahāyāna; sequential three contemplations[^133] are like the “horse,” carrying the Distinct teaching Mahāyāna; immediate‑emptiness and analytical‑emptiness contemplation[^134] are like the “ox,” carrying the Pervasive teaching Mahāyāna; analytical contemplation of dharmas practiced by oneself is like deer and sheep, carrying the Dharma of the two vehicles.  
“Innumerable” means: provisional and real dharmas are all called “vehicles,” and provisional and real wisdom‑contemplations are called “elephants, horses, cattle, and sheep”; it is not only that the teaching‑dharmas are very many, the wisdom‑contemplations are also innumerable.  
“Going out and coming in” means: two yet not two is coming in, not two yet two is going out; also, not two yet two is coming in, two yet not two is going out; the myriad returning to the one is coming in, the myriad within the one is going out; using for transforming others is going out, using for self‑practice is coming in. Going out with the Dharma to benefit beings is “interest,” the transforming work returning to oneself is “profit.”  
“And then it reaches other lands” means: it traverses the three lands[^137], traveling in the non‑path and reaching the Buddha‑path—that is its meaning; only the dharma‑nature[^144] is one’s own land.  
“The merchants and traders are also very numerous” means: bodhisattvas are merchants, and they again travel through the three lands seeking Dharma‑profit, therefore they are called numerous. Bodhisattvas of this land go to other regions to hear the Dharma; great beings from other regions come here to hear the sūtra; going and coming they gather profit. Moreover, the response and transformation bodies[^138] are like traders: bringing the real Dharma through the three lands, transforming and benefiting beings and returning to the dharma‑body[^36], therefore they are called very numerous. It is like people in the world who cause others to grasp wealth and flourish, and themselves also flourish.

### 4. Father's Anxiety and Regret (Lines 183-200)

<div class="bilingual-row">
<div class="chinese-source">
「父每念子」下，第四，即是父憂念子譬。此中亦二：一、念失子之苦。如來自昔至今，恒思子大機，故言「每念」。「五十餘年」者，五道也。開鬼出修羅，故言「餘」也。「未曾說」者，未曾向方便有餘土中臣佐吏[3]人說有此子機緣也。又應世已來自昔《華嚴》方等《大品》諸座，未曾向諸大士說此聲聞本是大乘之子。既非佛子，不解佛法，或如聾啞，或花著[4]拜座，或棄鉢茫然，種種不逮也。「心懷[5]悔恨」，悔昔不勤教詔致[6]令無訓逃逝，恨子不惟恩義疎我親他，內合如來悔不殷勤令入內凡，遂使退失。本解恨其無心不能精進固志逃迷不返，故言悔恨也。「自念老朽」者，化期將畢無傳大法之人，如老朽而無子也。

問：

法身所化諸菩薩等悉堪補處，何遽此憂？

答：

法身所化本無興廢，誰談老朽？此非所論。今明化身眷屬則有二種：一、法身大士，其相影嚮，迹雖弟子本或是師，亦不約此自念老朽也；二者同居凡夫，始從化佛初發道心者，名此為子也。子繼父業令胤族不斷，若身子受決作華光佛，則一方佛種相續不斷，大乘家業遞相傳付；若身子無可化之機，則大乘法財現無付囑，後[1]來眾生佛種安寄？老朽興歎正為此也。「復作是念我若得子」下，二、念得子為樂。可度之機名為「得子」，與受佛記名付法財，稱於本心復言「快樂」。領上總譬竟。[2]
</div>
<div class="english-translation">
Below “the father always thinks of the son,” fourth, this is the parable of the father’s anxious remembrance of the son. Within this there are also two: first, thinking of the pain of losing the son. From long ago until now the Tathāgata constantly thinks of the son’s great capacity, therefore it says “always thinks.” “Over fifty years” means the five paths[^22]; opening the ghost path and adding asuras, therefore it says “over.” “Never spoke” means he never told the ministers, assistants, clerks, and people[^3] in the Expedient With‑Remainder Land[^123] about this son’s capacity and conditions. Moreover, since appearing in the world, from the old *Avataṃsaka* and Vaipulya and *Mahāprajñāpāramitā* assemblies, he has never told the great ones that this śrāvaka is originally a son of the Mahāyāna[^139]. Since they are not Buddha‑sons, they do not understand Buddha‑dharma; some are like deaf‑mutes, some—flower‑offering—[4] worship the seat, some discard the bowl in confusion; in many ways they do not reach it. “Mind cherishing regret and resentment” means: he regrets that in the past he was not diligent in teaching and admonishing, leading to their being without instruction and fleeing away; he resents that the son does not consider gratitude and righteousness, distancing himself from me and drawing near to others. Internally this corresponds to the Tathāgata’s regret that he was not earnest in causing them to enter the inner‑ordinary stage[^148], thus causing them to retreat and be lost. The original explanation resents that they have no mind, cannot be diligent, and do not firmly set their resolve, fleeing delusion and not returning; therefore it says “regret and resentment.” “He himself thinks he is old and worn out” means: the period of transformation is about to end, and there is no one to transmit the great Dharma—like being old and worn out without a son.

**Question:** The bodhisattvas transformed by the dharma‑body[^36] are all able to fill the position of succession[^145]; why then this worry?

**Answer:** Those transformed by the dharma‑body are originally without rise or decline—who speaks of old and worn out? This is not the matter. Now we clarify that the retinue of the transformation body[^147][^146] has two kinds: first, dharma‑body great beings; their marks are like echoes and responses; though their traces are disciples, originally they may be teachers; he also does not, in terms of this, think himself old and worn out. Second are common‑dwelling ordinary beings, who from the transforming Buddha first aroused the mind of the Way; these are called sons. When the son continues the father’s enterprise, the lineage does not break: if Śāriputra receives the prediction[^149] and becomes the Buddha Flower‑Light[^152], then the Buddha‑seed[^150] in one region continues without break, and the Mahāyāna household enterprise[^139] is transmitted in turn. If Śāriputra has no capacity that can be transformed, then the Mahāyāna Dharma‑wealth[^151] presently has no entrustment; where will the Buddha‑seed of future beings be placed? The sigh over being old and worn out is precisely for this. Below “again he makes this thought: if I could obtain a son,” second, thinking of obtaining the son as joy. The capacity that can be crossed over is called “obtaining a son”; granting a Buddha prediction is called entrusting the Dharma‑wealth; it accords with his original mind and again he says “joy.” The receiving of the overall parable above is finished.[2]
