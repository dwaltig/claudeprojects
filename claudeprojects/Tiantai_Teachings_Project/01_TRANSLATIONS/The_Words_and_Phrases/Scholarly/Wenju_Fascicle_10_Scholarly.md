## 21. THE BENEFITS OF THE FUNDAMENTAL (Chapters 17 - 19)

The Master explains that the revelation of the Buddha's eternal life-span produces immense merit, categorized into levels of "Belief and Understanding."

### I. The Eight Stages of Merit
Zhiyi maps the merits of Chapters 17 and 18 to the **Eight Grades of Practitioners**. 
*   **The Architect's Note:** Merit is not a physical reward but the **Clarity of the Dharma-eye** obtained through the "Opening of the Fundamental." The "Teacher of the Dharma" (Chapter 19) obtains the purification of the six senses, representing the internal resonance with the Eternal Buddha.

## 22. THE UNIVERSAL GATE (Guānshìyīn Pǐn 觀世音品)

Chapter 25 is analyzed through the lens of **Resonance** (*gǎnyìng*).

### I. The Meaning of "Universal Gate"
*   **Universal (*Pǔ*):** Pervading the Dharma-realm without exception.
*   **Gate (*Mén*):** The wisdom through which sentient beings enter and the Buddha responds.
*   **The 33 Manifestations:** Zhiyi explains that these are not 33 fixed forms but the **Responsive Power of the Reward Body** appearing in whatever form resonates with the seeker's capacity. "Should they need a King, he appears as a King; should they need a Bhikṣu, he appears as a Bhikṣu."

## 23. TOTAL RETENTION AND PROPAGATION (Chapters 26 - 28)

### I. Dhāraṇī (Chapter 26)
*   **Definition:** "Total Retention" (*zǒngchí*). Holding all good and preventing all evil.
*   **Technical Mapping:** The Master defines the spells as "Secret Signs" (*mìhào*) of the Buddha's army, protecting the practitioner from the "Maras of the Five Corruptions."

### II. The Four Dharmas of Samantabhadra (Chapter 28)
To attain the Lotus Sutra after the Buddha's passing, one must practice the Four Dharmas:
1.  **Being Protected by the Buddhas:** Cultivating the "Root of Belief."
2.  **Planting Roots of Virtue:** Practicing the "Six Paramitas."
3.  **Entering the Group of the Truly Assured:** Stability in the Middle Way.
4.  **Arousing the Vow to Save All Beings:** The Great Compassion.

---

## 24. FINAL ENTRUSTMENT (The Conclusion)

The Master concludes the 10-fascicle series by emphasizing that the Lotus Sutra is the **King of Sutras** because it "Directly Points to the Source."
*   **The End of the Trace:** The historical mission is complete.
*   **The Beginning of the Fundamental:** The practitioner realizes that the "Assembly on Eagle Peak" has never dispersed. The sutra ends not with a departure, but with the **Eternal Presence** of the One Vehicle.

### ARCHITECT'S TECHNICAL APPARATUS

1.  **The Mapping of "No-Equal":** In the exegesis of Samantabhadra, Zhiyi uses the term "No-Equal" (*wú-děng-děng*) to describe the Middle Way—it is not equal to the two extremes, yet it makes all things equal.
2.  **The Protection of the Spells:** Zhiyi provides a fascinating scholastic defense of mantras, mapping them to the "Secret Language of Kings" (Saindhavas), where a single word contains multiple meanings known only to the wise.
3.  **Completion of the Series:** With Fascicle 10, the *Wenju* upgrade is complete. The work has transitioned from a study guide to a robust scholarly apparatus, preserving the dialectical rigor of the Tiantai tradition.
