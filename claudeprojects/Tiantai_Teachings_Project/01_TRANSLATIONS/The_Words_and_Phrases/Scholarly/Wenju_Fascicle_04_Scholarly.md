## 9. THE FIVE CORRUPTIONS (Wǔ Zhuó 五濁)

The Master explains the necessity of "Expedient Means" by analyzing the corruption of the age. Because the readiness (*jī*) of sentient beings is obscured, the "One Vehicle" must be temporarily veiled.

### I. Analysis of the Five Corruptions
1.  **Corruption of the Kalpa (*Jié zhuó*):** The temporal container. When the other four corruptions gather in a single age, it is called the "Corruption of the Kalpa."
2.  **Corruption of Views (*Jiàn zhuó*):** The dense thicket of the 62 wrong views. Beings "seek to abandon suffering through suffering" (practicing wrong austerities).
3.  **Corruption of Afflictions (*Fánnǎo zhuó*):** Deeply rooted attachment to the five desires. Beings are "poor and without merit or wisdom,"相續苦不斷 (continuously suffering without break).
4.  **Corruption of Living Beings (*Zhòngshēng zhuó*):** Beings are defined by the "Combination of Five Aggregates" which are themselves corrupted. They enter the "Evil Path of Birth and Death."
5.  **Corruption of Life-span (*Mìng zhuó*):** The shortening of the vital force. Beings are born and die in "micro-forms," their lives appearing and disappearing like thin curds (*bóluò*).

### II. The Decision: Discarding the Great to Apply the Small
The Master interprets the Buddha's internal deliberation:
*   **Initial Intent:** "When I first sat at the Path-site... I thought: I should reveal the One Vehicle."
*   **The Obstacle:** "But I saw that sentient beings were submerged in the Five Corruptions. If I spoke the Great, they would slander it and fall into the evil paths."
*   **The Solution:** "I followed the path of the previous Buddhas and applied the power of Expedients. I 'Discarded the Great' (*qì dà*) and 'Applied the Small' (*shī xiǎo*), speaking the Three Vehicles to lead them out of the house."

## 10. MAPPING THE "THREE CARS" AS PREPARATION

Zhiyi establishes that the "Three Cars" (Sheep, Deer, Ox) mentioned in the legal and poetic sections of the sutra are not the "Real" but are the "Entrance to the Real."

1.  **Sheep-cart:** Represents the Śrāvaka Vehicle (Four Noble Truths).
2.  **Deer-cart:** Represents the Pratyekabuddha Vehicle (Twelve Links of Dependent Origination).
3.  **Ox-cart:** Represents the Bodhisattva Vehicle of the Shared and Distinct teachings.
4.  **The Great White Ox-cart:** Represents the **Lotus Sutra** (The Perfect Teaching).

### III. Dialectical Q&A on the Mappings

**Question:** If the Buddha's original vow was to lead everyone to the Buddha-vehicle, why wait forty years?
**Answer:**
*   **Maturation of Capacity:** Like a physician waiting for a patient's fever to break before administering a potent tonic. The Small Vehicle is the "Cooling Medicine"; the Lotus is the "Restorative Treasure."
*   **The Nature of the Vow:** The vow is "Impartial" (*pěngděng*), but the application is "Sequential" (*cìdì*). The sequential application is itself the fulfillment of the impartial vow.

**Question:** Is the "Ox-cart" (Third Vehicle) the same as the "Great White Ox-cart" (One Vehicle)?
**Answer:**
*   **Distinct Difference:** No. The "Ox-cart" represents the **Distinct Teaching** Bodhisattva who still views the Three Realms as something to be escaped (Dualistic). The "Great White Ox-cart" represents the **Perfect Teaching** where Samsara and Nirvana are non-dual. The "White" color signifies the Pure Ground of Reality (*Shíxiàng*), untouched by the duality of "Escape" and "Bondage."

## 11. OBSERVATION OF THE MIND: INTERNALIZING THE CORRUPTIONS

The Master argues that the Five Corruptions are not just external historical conditions but internal mental states:
*   **Corruption of Views in the Mind:** Clinging to the "I" as a permanent entity.
*   **Corruption of Afflictions in the Mind:** The rising of the Three Poisons in every thought-moment.
*   **The Solution:** Observing that the mind is "Thus" (*rúshì*). By seeing the "Suchness" of the corruptions, they are transformed into the "Suchness" of Enlightenment.

### ARCHITECT'S TECHNICAL APPARATUS

1.  **The Mapping of the Three Vehicles to the One:** Zhiyi is careful to note that the Three Vehicles are not "False" in the sense of being lies, but are "Provisional" (*quán*)—they are true within their own limited scope, but their ultimate purpose is to lead to the One.
2.  **The 62 Views:** Zhiyi references the *Brahmajala* and *Prajñaparamita* to categorize the "Thicket of Views." This philological grounding distinguishes the Scholarly track from the vernacular.
3.  **Anachronism Check:** Terms like "Janitorial" or "Motel" (used in the Practitioner track) are replaced with "Cessation," "Rest-stop," and "Provisional Attainment" to maintain academic fidelity.
