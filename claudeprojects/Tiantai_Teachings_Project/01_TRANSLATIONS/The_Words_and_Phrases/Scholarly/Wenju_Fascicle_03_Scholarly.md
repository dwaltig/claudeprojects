## 8. CHAPTER 2: EXPEDIENT MEANS (Fāngbiàn Pǐn)

The text moves from the "Prose" (*Chángháng*) to the "Verses" (*Gè sòng*).

### I. Why Verses? (Lóngshù Pí póshā)
Nāgārjuna's *Vibhāṣā* gives four reasons for repeating the prose in verse:
1.  **Custom:** In India, it is customary to have "Scattered Flowers" (Prose) and "Strung Flowers" (Verse).
2.  **Preference:** Some people prefer prose, some prefer verse.
3.  **Understanding:** Some understand via prose, some via verse.
4.  **Capacity:** Sharp faculties understand instantly (Prose); dull faculties need repetition (Verse).

### II. Maitreya's Doubt (Mílè Yí)
Maitreya has three thoughts:
1.  **Mindfulness of the Omens:** "Why are these six strange things happening?" (Flower rain, earth shaking, light).
2.  **Mindfulness of the Respondent:** "Who can answer this?"
3.  **Mindfulness of Mañjuśrī:** "Mañjuśrī has served past Buddhas; he must know."

**Zhiyi's Technical Note:** Mañjuśrī had the thought to answer *before* Maitreya asked, but he waited. This is the **Hidden Question and Hidden Answer** (*Fúyí Fúdá*).

## 9. MAÑJUŚRĪ'S ANSWER (Wénshū Dá)

Mañjuśrī answers by citing the past. "I remember in the past..." (*Wǒ niàn guòqù...*).

### I. The Buddha Sun Moon Lamp Bright (Rìyuè Dēngmíng Fó)
*   **Name Analysis:**
    *   **Sun (*Rì*):** Wisdom (*Huì*).
    *   **Moon (*Yuè*):** Concentration (*Dìng*).
    *   **Lamp (*Dēng*):** The integration of both to illuminate the world.
    *   **Bright (*Míng*):** The function of breaking darkness.
*   **The 20,000 Buddhas:** There were 20,000 Buddhas with the same name.
    *   *Interpretation:* This signifies the continuity of the **Buddha-Nature** through time. The name is the same because the Real Nature (*Shíxìng*) is always the same.

### II. The Eight Sons (Bā Zǐ)
The final Sun Moon Lamp Bright Buddha had eight sons before leaving home.
*   **Meaning:** The "Eight Sons" represent the **Eight Consciousnesses** (*Bā Shí*) or the **Eightfold Path** (*Bā Zhèngdào*).
*   **Transformation:** When the Father (Buddha) taught the Lotus, the Sons (Consciousnesses) were transformed into Dharma-Princes (Wisdoms).

### III. The Two Bodhisattvas
1.  **Wonder Light (Miàoguāng):** The Teacher. This was **Mañjuśrī** in a past life.
    *   *Function:* He held the Sutra (Memory/Wisdom).
2.  **Fame Seeker (Qiúmíng):** The Disciple. This was **Maitreya** in a past life.
    *   *Name:* He sought fame and profit, read secular books, and was lazy.
    *   *Zhiyi's Defense:* "Fame Seeker" was an expedient display. He was actually a great Bodhisattva engaging with the secular world to save beings ("Harmonizing the Light"). If he were truly lazy, he wouldn't be Maitreya now.

## 10. THE CORRELATION (Jīn-Xī Xiāng-Zhào 今昔相照)

Mañjuśrī draws a parallel between the Past (Sun Moon Lamp Bright) and the Present (Shakyamuni).

| Past Event | Present Event | Implication |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Sun Moon Lamp Bright preached *Infinite Meanings* | Shakyamuni preached *Infinite Meanings* | The Setup is the same. |
| He entered Samādhi | Shakyamuni entered Samādhi | The Preparation is the same. |
| Flowers rained, Earth shook | Flowers rained, Earth shook | The Sign is the same. |
| He rose and preached *Lotus Sutra* | (Prediction) | **Shakyamuni will preach the *Lotus Sutra*.** |

**Conclusion:**
"I see this auspicious sign is exactly like the past. Therefore, I know the Tathāgata desires to speak the Great Dharma."

### ARCHITECT'S TECHNICAL APPARATUS

1.  **The Four Hidden Doubts:** Zhiyi analyzes the interaction between Maitreya and Mañjuśrī as a complex psychological dance. Maitreya pretends to doubt; Mañjuśrī pretends to recollect. Both are Ancient Buddhas putting on a play (*Yǎn xì*) for the assembly.
2.  **Fame Seeker (*Qiúmíng*):** This is a crucial defense of the "Worldly Bodhisattva." Just because a practitioner reads secular books or seeks fame doesn't mean they aren't on the Path. It might be their specific *Upaya* (Skillful Means).
3.  **The "One Time" of History:** By linking Shakyamuni to Sun Moon Lamp Bright, Zhiyi collapses time. The "Lotus Assembly" is not a one-time event; it is a **Ritual Reenactment** that happens in every world system.
