## 6. THE LIST OF ARHATS (Continued)

The Master provides detailed exegesis for the remaining disciples, recovering their "Fundamental" status from their "Trace" appearances as Śrāvakas.

### I. The Final Arhats
1.  **Gavāmpati (憍梵波提):** 
    *   *Trace:* Known for his "Cow-ruminating" habit (past karma).
    *   *Fundamental:* He dwells in the "Ox-King" Samādhi, demonstrating the Reality Mark where "coarse" habits do not obstruct pure wisdom.
2.  **Revata (離婆多):**
    *   *Trace:* Realized the "False Union" of the body through the parable of the two ghosts.
    *   *Perfect Teaching:* Perceives the Five Aggregates as the Dharma-Realm; neither self nor other.
3.  **Vakkula (薄拘羅):**
    *   *Trace:* Foremost in Longevity (160 years) and "Five Undying States."
    *   *Observation of the Mind:* His longevity represents the **Eternity** (*Cháng*) of Nirvana; his silence represents **Purity** (*Jìng*).
4.  **Mahākauṣṭhila (摩訶拘絺羅):**
    *   *Trace:* The "Long-Nail" Brahmin; foremost in the Four Unhindered Eloquences.
5.  **Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra (富樓那):**
    *   *Trace:* Foremost in Expounding the Dharma.
    *   *Fundamental:* A hidden Bodhisattva of the Distant Past who manifests as a Śrāvaka to refine the "Middle Root" practitioners.
6.  **Ananda (阿難):**
    *   *Trace:* Foremost in Multi-Hearing.
    *   *Perfect Mapping:* "Ocean Ananda"—the Ocean of Buddha-Dharma flows into his heart without overflow.
7.  **Rāhula (羅睺羅):**
    *   *Trace:* Foremost in Invisible Practice (*Mìxíng*).
    *   *Perfect Interpretation:* "Obstacle" (*Luóhóu*) refers to obstructing the two extremes (Samsara/Nirvana) to abide in the Middle Way.

### II. The Two Thousand Learners and No-Learners
The Master notes that these are listed to guide those who "Hide their virtue" (*Cángmíng*).
*   **No-Learning:** Represents the attainment where nothing more remains to be added to the realization of the Middle Way.
*   **Learning:** Represents the ongoing function of applying that realization to the world.

### III. The Bhikṣunīs (Nuns)
*   **Mahāprajāpatī (波闍波提):** Represents the "Great Love Way."
    *   *Fundamental:* She is the "Mother of Wisdom" (Prajñāpāramitā) from which all Buddhas are born.
*   **Yasodharā (耶輸陀羅):** Represents "Glory" or "Retention."
    *   *Fundamental:* She represents the ability to "Retain" the seeds of Buddhahood within the world of form.

## 7. THE SIX AUSPICIOUS OMENS (六種瑞相)

The Master explains that the Buddha manifests these omens to prepare the assembly for the "Opening of the Expedient."

### I. The Rain of Four Flowers
*   **The Flowers:** Mandārava (small/large white) and Mañjūṣaka (small/large red).
*   **Mapping to the Four Positions:**
    1.  *Small White:* The Ten Dwellings (*Jiù*).
    2.  *Large White:* The Ten Practices (*Xíng*).
    3.  *Small Red:* The Ten Dedications (*Xiàng*).
    4.  *Large Red:* The Ten Stages (*Dì*).
*   **Exegesis:** The flowers "rain" from the sky to represent that these ranks are born from the "Sky of Reality" (*Lǐ tiān*). They fall upon the assembly to signal that everyone present is a candidate for these positions.

### II. The Six Earth-Shaking Movements
*   **The Movements:** Moving, rising, surging, shaking, roaring, and crashing.
*   **Dialectical Mapping:** These represent the **Six Stages of Breaking Ignorance**.
    *   *The Master's Note:* "Ignorance is massive and unmoving. When the Great Path is about to be revealed, the 'Ground' of the mind must be shaken to its foundations to allow the Truth to emerge."

### III. Dialectical Q&A (Wèn-Dá)
**Question:** Teaching and entering Samādhi are the regular activities of a Buddha. Why are they considered "Auspicious Omens" here?
**Answer:**
1.  **Non-Dispersion:** Though the teaching ended, the assembly did not disperse. This is "Extraordinary."
2.  **The Nature of the Samādhi:** The Buddha entered the "Samādhi of the Place of Immeasurable Meaning." This is the "Preface" to the Lotus Samādhi. Entering one to signal the other is a unique signal of the "Opening of the Real."
3.  **Historical Precedent:** Mañjuśrī cites previous Buddhas who manifested the same omens. If they were common, they would not serve as a "Proof of the Past" to explain the present.

## 8. THE WHITE HAIR-PORE RADIANCE (白毫相光)

*   **The Mark:** The light emitted from the hair-pore between the eyebrows.
*   **Mapping:** The eyebrows represent the two extremes (Emptiness and Form); the hair-pore in the center represents the **Middle Way**.
*   **Function:** The light illuminates 18,000 worlds to the East.
    *   *Numerical Mapping:* 18,000 represents the **Eighteen Realms** (*dhātus*) multiplied by the **Hundred Realms and Thousand Suchnesses** (*Bǎijiè Qiān-rú*).
    *   *Directional Mapping:* The East represents the "Beginning" (the position of the Ten Dwellings). To illuminate the East is to illuminate the *starting point* of the Path.

### ARCHITECT'S TECHNICAL APPARATUS

1.  **The Four Flowers and the Four Ranks:** This is one of Zhiyi's most influential mappings. He transforms a poetic celestial event into a precise roadmap of the Bodhisattva's progress.
2.  **The Six Movements as Internal States:** Zhiyi consistently internalizes the "External Omens." The earth shaking is not a seismic event; it is the **Shattering of Habitual Views** (*vāsana*).
3.  **The Omens as "Proof":** The Q&A establishes that the Lotus Sutra is not a "new" teaching but a "Universal Constant." The omens are the "Formatting" that every Buddha uses when they are about to reveal the One Vehicle.
