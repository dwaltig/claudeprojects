### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi enters the third specific-parable movement: equal granting of great carts.

He maps four inner units:

1. father sees children escape danger and rejoices
2. children request carts
3. father equally grants great carts
4. children rejoice in receiving

---

### Order Shift and Mutual Manifestation

Zhiyi notes order can appear inverted relative to earlier law-exposition:

- here relief from danger can appear before explicit request dynamic

He treats this as mutual manifestation, not contradiction.

Obstacle-removal and capacity-arising illuminate each other.

---

### Four Cross-Case Possibilities

He lays out multiple cases:

- obstacle removed then great capacity stirs
- capacity stirs before obstacle fully removed
- reciprocal emergence cases

This supports non-rigid reading of pedagogical sequence.

---

### Four-Crossroads and "Open Ground"

He rejects simplistic impurity-removal readings and says:

- four crossroads correspond to four truths contemplatively met
- open ground corresponds to deeper completion beyond initial seeing

Thus joy is tied to real path status, not mere emotional relief.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 28 reframes "equal giving" as processual truth:

rescue, request, gift, and joy are doctrinally interlocked.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 等賜大車 | Equally granting great carts | One great gift for all children | Reveals non-discriminating great-vehicle completion |
| 免難歡喜 | Escape danger and rejoice | Out of fire, into calm joy | Initial completion marker |
| 索車 | Requesting carts | Asking for promised path | Capacity actively seeking completion |
| 機動障除互現 | Capacity-moving and obstacle-clearing mutually appear | Two lights crossing | Non-linear pedagogical causality |
| 四衢道中 | In four-crossroads way | Four-truths meeting point | Doctrinal geography of transition |
| 露地 | Open ground | Fully cleared field | Deeper completion state beyond first release |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi shows how one joy can carry many causal orders without losing doctrinal coherence.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Four-part equal-granting substructure preserved.
- [x] Relief/request order-shift logic preserved.
- [x] Mutual manifestation doctrine preserved.
- [x] Four-crossroads/open-ground interpretation preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
