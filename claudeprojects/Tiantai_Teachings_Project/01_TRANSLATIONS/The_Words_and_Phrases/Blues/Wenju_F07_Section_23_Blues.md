### The Setup

Now listen.

A practical challenge is raised around the difficulty of bearing no-birth insight.

Zhiyi answers by calibrating teaching length and density through the four siddhanta intents.

Not all roots can be led by the same tempo.

---

### Calibration Logic

This Q/A preserves a non-uniform pedagogy:

- some learners require long-form scaffolding
- some can receive concise direct articulation
- both are valid when aligned with intention and capacity

The criterion is not stylistic preference.
It is liberation-effectiveness.

---

### Witness Discipline

This F07-B23 block is mapped as a Q/A calibration segment with no additional apparatus bundle in scope.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 23 protects adaptive method.

Without this, either brevity is idolized or extension is dismissed, and both can fail real learners.

Skillful means listens before it speaks.
