### The Setup

Now listen.

This is the hard scene in the hall.

Right as the Dharma exposition proper is opening, five thousand stand up and leave.

Zhiyi refuses shallow reading here. He does not treat the scene as simple rejection theater. He reads it as capacity management under compassionate strategy.

---

### The First-Round Structure Behind the Scene

He reminds us the first round has five parts:

1. Dharma exposition proper.
2. Śāriputra's receiving-understanding.
3. Buddha's confirmation.
4. Bestowing prediction.
5. Four assemblies rejoicing.

The departure belongs in the threshold dynamics of that opening arc, not as an isolated anecdote.

---

### Why the Filtering Happens

Zhiyi interprets "when these words were spoken" as a deliberate filtering moment.

The five thousand are marked by three faults:

- obstruction (five-corruption burden)
- grasping (clinging small, obscuring great)
- overweening pride (claiming attainment not actually realized)

Buddha's three pauses plus Śāriputra's repeated requests are not petty theater. They are capacity checks.

When those branches-and-leaves depart, a certain kind of slander is prevented.

---

### "Branches and Leaves" Is Not Random Insult

Zhiyi glosses branches-and-leaves as fine and trivial material unfit for vessel-use in this moment.

Meaning: clinging to expedient-as-expedient blocks reception of the Great.

So "their withdrawal is fine" is not contempt speech. It means:

- they avoid deepening slander through forced hearing
- they stop obstructing others' clearer reception

Departure here can be less harmful than forced attendance.

---

### Q/A: Why Not Keep Them Seated and Block Their Hearing?

Question:

If Buddha's compassion is vast, why not keep them there but seal their hearing (as in other scriptural scenes), or force-hear for shock effect?

Zhiyi's answer is surgical:

Different contexts require different medicine.

In this setting, letting them leave is the compassionate act because staying would provoke greater slander and damage. If leaving gives some benefit and reduces harm, dispatch is appropriate.

He contrasts modes: in some cases forceful speech is right; here compassionate dispatch is right.

No single tactic is absolutized.

---

### Q/A: If They Didn't Benefit in the Hall, What's the Gain of Leaving?

Question:

If they were unbenefited in-seat, what benefit comes from departure?

Answer:

They are tie-forming people, not present-capacity receivers.

Zhiyi points to long-cycle examples: doubt now does not cancel future crossing. Karmic linkage can mature later, including through post-Buddha propagation streams.

So leaving now is not final exclusion. It is delayed ripening.

---

### Why This Matters for Reading the Lotus

This scene teaches non-binary compassion.

Compassion is not always "keep everyone in the room at all costs." Sometimes compassion is:

- protect the Dharma from immediate slander
- protect listeners from greater self-harm
- preserve future-entry conditions instead of forcing premature exposure

Zhiyi reads this as strategic mercy, not defeat.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 揀眾 | Filter the assembly | Clearing the room for the deep cut | Capacity-sorting before full disclosure |
| 三止 | Three pauses | Three warning bars before the drop | Protective pacing before decisive teaching |
| 上慢 | Overweening pride | Claiming you heard the master when you only heard noise | Key obstruction to Great-Vehicle reception |
| 枝葉/根本 | Branches-leaves / root-base | Surface clutter vs root line | Distinguishes unstable grasping from root reception |
| 結緣人 | Tie-forming person | Not tonight's receiver, still in future orbit | Explains delayed benefit logic |
| 弘經人 | Sutra-propagating persons | Future carriers of the track | Post-extinction transmission path for late ripening |

---

### The Lesson

The Five Thousand departure is not a cheap "bad audience" story. It is a hard mercy story. Zhiyi says timing and capacity govern whether staying helps or harms. In this case, letting them go preserves future possibility and reduces present damage. The path is still open; the hearing window is deferred.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Five-thousand departure interpreted within full first-round structure.
- [x] Three-fault diagnosis preserved (obstruction, grasping, pride).
- [x] Compassion-dispatch rationale preserved (not contempt, not exclusion).
- [x] Both Q/A exchanges preserved (non-forced hearing; delayed future benefit).
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
- [x] No doctrinal flattening (capacity triage and long-cycle benefit both retained).
