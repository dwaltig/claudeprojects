### The Setup

Now listen.

After release, Zhiyi shows the next move:

capacity-fit work assignment.

This is not giving up the child.

It is keeping relationship alive through an accessible form.

---

### Why Release Works

Release removes immediate pressure and slander-risk.

Then small-path work can begin without panic.

He frames this as preparatory alignment,
not final destination.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 34 demonstrates compassion's tactical patience.

The line can be carried only if the receiver is not crushed.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves:

- `[4] 語【大】，放【甲】`
- `[5] 途【大】，塗【甲】`
- `[6] 宜【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
