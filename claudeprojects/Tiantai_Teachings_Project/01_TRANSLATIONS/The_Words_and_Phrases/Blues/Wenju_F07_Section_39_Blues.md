### The Setup

Now listen.

The text marks a silent inward turn:

"they thought thus..."

Before public request is voiced,
an internal reception and recognition process occurs.

---

### Why Silent Understanding Matters

This unit preserves interiority in the transmission path.

- understanding can ripen before declaration
- shame, hope, and readiness can reorganize inwardly first
- spoken request then emerges from prepared interior ground

---

### Witness Discipline

This F07-B39 block is mapped as a line-300 silent-understanding chain with no additional apparatus bundle in scope.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 39 protects psychological realism.

Without this interior phase, prophecy reception can look mechanically procedural rather than existentially transformed.

| 領解 | Receiving understanding | Internal doctrinal uptake | Confirms comprehension before speech |
| 意先言後 | Mind first, speech later | Interior-first sequence | Orders transformation process |

### The Lesson

Sometimes the turning happens in silence first.
Then the mouth can ask true.
