Now listen.

After the named session musicians come the crew: the 2000 Learners and No-Learners, and the Bhikṣuṇī assembly led by Mahāprajāpatī and Yaśodharā.

These aren't extras. They're the backbone. Without the crew, there's no album.

## The 2000 Learners and No-Learners (學無學二千)

### What's a Learner? What's a No-Learner?

In the Tripiṭaka scheme:

- **18 kinds of Learners** — those still training, from stream-entry through once-returning
- **9 kinds of No-Learners** — Arhats who have completed the training

In the Shared Teaching:

- **Grounds 1-5** = Learners
- **Ground 6** = No-Learner
- Or: **Grounds 1-9** = Learners; **Buddha-ground** = No-Learner

In the Distinct and Perfect:

- Learner = "with effort" (*yǒu gōngyòng*)
- No-Learner = "without effort" (*wú gōngyòng*)

But here's the twist. The *Āgama* records a question:

> "A non-Buddhist asked the Buddha: 'Does an Arhat still learn?'
> The Buddha said: 'An Arhat does not make evil dharmas; he abides in good dharmas. Learning his no-more-learning is precisely called learning.'"

So Learners can be called No-Learners. And No-Learners can still learn. Four statements. Five statements. Twenty statements. The categories dissolve under examination.

### Fundamental and Trace

> "Fundamentally, they are Dharma-body great beings dwelling in the 'full-word' learner/no-more-learning position; sentient beings respond by appearing as 'half-word' learners/no-more-learners, adorning the Twin Sāla Trees."

The "full word" is Mahāyāna teaching. The "half word" is Hīnayāna. These 2000 are playing the Hīnayāna role, but fundamentally they're bodhisattvas in disguise.

### Contemplating the Mind

> "Rightly contemplating the Middle Way, not conditioning on the two extremes — the 'middle' is precisely no-more-learning; one who can contemplate in this way is called a learner."

If you contemplate the Middle Way, you're learning no-learning. The numbers dissolve:

> "In contemplating form and mind as possessing the Ten Dharma Realms and the Ten Suchnesses, with realms and suchnesses mutually interfused, one thereby has two thousand."

2000 = 10 realms × 10 suchnesses × mutual interfusion. A number, yes. But also a contemplation key.

## The Bhikṣuṇī Assembly (比丘尼)

### Why Two Leaders?

Old commentators tried to split the nuns into "many knowledge" and "few knowledge" assemblies. Zhiyi rejects this:

> "It merely raises the leaders of the two assemblies; why must one labor to name them 'greater/smaller'?"

Two names. Two leaders. Not a hierarchy.

## Mahāprajāpatī (波闍波提): Great Path of Love

### The Name

> "Prajāpatī (波闍波提): translated as 'Great Path of Love.' Also called 'Gautamī' — 'Host of the Multitude.'"

She was the Buddha's aunt and foster mother. She raised him after his mother died. When women asked to ordain, she was their leader.

### Fundamental and Trace

> "Fundamentally, she abides in the Dharma-gate of wisdom-transcendence; in trace, she is the mother of a thousand Buddhas, a teacher who gives birth and nurtures."

Not just the Buddha's foster mother — *the mother of a thousand Buddhas*. The trace-form (aunt who raised Siddhartha) is one manifestation of an endless maternal function.

### Contemplating the Mind

> "The Middle Contemplation is broad and expansive — thus 'great.' Unconditioned compassion — thus 'love.' The Middle principle is open and penetrating — thus 'path.' 'Great' is self-practice; 'love' is transforming others... 'Path' connects self-practice and transforming others."

The name itself encodes the Three Contemplations.

### The 6000

The number again encodes practice:

> "In contemplating the six sense faculties as pure and complete with a thousand merits — although the eye has eight hundred and the ear has twelve hundred — one uses the greater to fill the lesser and the count reaches six thousand."

6 faculties × 1000 merits = 6000. Every number is a gate.

## Yaśodharā (耶輸陀羅): Flower-Color, Mother of Rāhula

### The Name

> "Yaśodharā, mother of Rāhula: it uses the son to mark the mother. Translated as 'Flower-Color,' or 'Name-and-Fame.'"

She was the Buddha's wife. She held the household while he awakened. She was slandered when pregnant. She threw herself and her child into fire to prove her innocence — and the fire became a lotus pond.

### The Three Wives

The texts disagree on which wife bore Rāhula:

- Gopā (瞿夷) — "Bright Maiden"
- Yaśodharā (耶輸) — "Flower-Color"
- Deer Park (鹿野) — a third

Zhiyi reconciles:

> "Perhaps those sutras cite the 'greater mother,' while here it cites the birth mother."

But then he applies the Three Contemplations:

> "In contemplating emptiness and the outflow-free Dharma-joy, Deer Park represents the wife; in contemplating provisionality and path-kind wisdom, Yaśu represents the wife; in contemplating the middle and Dharma-joy, Gopā represents the wife."

Three wives = Three Contemplations. The domestic biography encodes the full doctrine.

### Fundamental and Trace

> "As wives, they are equal — how could one of vast ground be the Crown Prince's wife? Therefore we know that fundamentally she abides in quiescent samādhi and subtle Dharma-joy; in trace she is the Buddha's wife."

Yaśodharā isn't just "the wife who stayed behind." She's a bodhisattva who *vowed* to be the Buddha's wife:

> "The *Sūtra of the Sorrowful Flower* says: 'In the presence of the Buddha Ratnagarbha, she vowed only to be a wife.'"

She chose this role. For kalpas.

## The Big Picture: Śūraṅgama Power

Zhiyi's summary of the entire assembly:

> "The great Arhats descend from the ground of the Dharmakāya, bowing their shadows and following conditions; their traces come down upon the waters in myriad ways. They are learners and non-learners; they appear as male and female; they manifest the path and manifest the mundane. With Śūraṅgama power there is nothing they do not manifest — skillful expedients and good provisional means are like this."

**Śūraṅgama power** = the heroic march samādhi, the ability to manifest any form required.

Every Arhat, every nun, every learner, every number — all of it is *trace*. The fundamental is the Dharmakāya playing roles.

The studio is staffed with bodhisattvas pretending to be something less. The production crew is infinite.
