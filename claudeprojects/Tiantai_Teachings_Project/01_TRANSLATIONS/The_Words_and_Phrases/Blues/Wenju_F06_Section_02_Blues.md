### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi opens Fascicle Six by scoring the whole verse movement before running details.

He gives hard counts, nested splits, and what each split is doing.

---

### Macro Score: 165 Verse Lines

He divides the verse section into two major arcs:

1. first 100 lines: verses that echo the prior long prose
2. later 65 lines: method for transmitting the scripture

Within the first arc:

- opening/simile-expansion and synthesis-expansion are separated
- opening simile itself is split into general and specific parts

This is compositional architecture, not loose commentary.

---

### Six Intents, Four Explicit, Two Carried Along

Zhiyi says the general simile has six intents.

The verse explicitly sings four, while two are carried implicitly:

- house section carries the one-gate logic
- five-hundred section carries the thirty-sons logic

So omission on the surface is not doctrinal omission in function.

---

### House as Body-of-Samsara Diagnostics

He then turns the house imagery into layered diagnostics:

- long-duration decay, instability, collapse
- body/organ mappings
- cognition and sensory entanglement
- impurity/suffering/no-self dynamics

The house is both cosmological and contemplative anatomy.

---

### Fire Sequence (First Segment)

In this block he launches the fire sequence and details the first affliction field:

- focus falls on the five dull afflictions
- each is mapped by animal imagery and behavior patterns
- pride, anger, ignorance, greed, and doubt are rendered as lived psychodynamics

This section ends before the explicit five-sharp expansion begins.

---

### Witness Cluster Discipline

B02 includes an essential apparatus bundle for this opening mega-line:

`[3] [4] [A1] [1] [2] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [A2] [14] [15] [＊15-1] [16]`

These witnesses are part of the source lock and carry interpretive weight in this block.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 02 is the master chart plus first burn analysis.

It establishes how the verse should be read and prevents later doctrinal drift.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 偈一百六十五行 | 165 verse lines | Full track-length score | Sets total architecture for this unit |
| 開譬 / 合譬 | Open simile / combined simile | Image spread / image-doctrine lock | Two major interpretive movements |
| 六意止頌其四兼得其二 | Six intents, four sung, two carried | Four on the page, two in the weave | Compression rule for verse reading |
| 五鈍使 | Five dull afflictions | Heavy-habit cluster | First fire-house psychological field |
| 火起 | Fire rising | Affliction ignition | Names activation of suffering dynamics |
| 因緣觀心兩番釋 | Causal and contemplative twofold explanation | History read and mind read | Dual hermeneutic lane for one image set |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi starts by tuning the listener's ear: count the lines, map the structure, then read the fire as your own mind-world exposed.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] 165-line macro architecture preserved.
- [x] Nested opening/synthesis and general/specific splits preserved.
- [x] Six-intent compression rule preserved.
- [x] Fire-house first segment (five dull afflictions) preserved.
- [x] B02 witness bundle explicitly preserved.
- [x] No spill into line-37 five-sharp expansion block.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
