### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi enters direct Q/A to settle a practical confusion:

if one cloud and one rain represent one voice,
how do different receivers hear and advance differently?

He answers by keeping one source and differentiated uptake together.

---

### Path/Fruit Clarification

A second clarification follows:

- two-vehicle severance and wisdom are not rejected
- but they are repositioned as bodhisattva-path cause
- they are not to be seized as final completion

This redirects attachment without erasing real attainment.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B13 apparatus continuity:

- `[1] 當【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[2] 汝【大】，汝等【甲】`
- `[3] 還【大】，〔－〕【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 13 prevents stagnation at intermediate fruits.

It keeps gratitude for attained severance while reopening trajectory toward full Buddha fruition.

### The Lesson

One rain does not mean one timetable.
And genuine attainment is still not the final stop.
