### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi maps the father-side sequence in four beats:

1. where he sees
2. immediate recognition
3. joy
4. fulfillment of long-held wish to entrust

---

### Adapted Joy

This joy is not mere relief.

It is strategic joy:

at last there is someone who can receive and carry the household wealth.

Entrustment becomes possible.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 32 balances Section 31:

the child panics, the father recognizes and adapts.

Together they form the hinge into pursuit-and-inducement.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves:

- `[1] 大【大】，本【甲】`
- `[2] 也【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
