### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi opens a large architecture map:

- this segment spans three chapter units
- understanding and confirmation may be embedded, not always separately split
- current chapter speaks causes and conditions
- following chapters carry prophecy operations

Then he sets remote and near causal ladders through 大通智勝佛 narrative framing.

---

### Structural Work Being Done

This is a control-board passage.

It aligns:

- prose and verse roles
- event-history and doctrinal function
- chapter boundaries and pedagogical sequencing

Without this map, the long causal narrative can feel like digression.
With this map, it reads as targeted lower-root guidance toward liberation certainty.

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B20 apparatus continuity:

- `[4] 由【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[5] 之【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[6] 間是中道【大】，中間是中道【甲】`
- `[7] 智【大】，智勝【甲】`
- `[1] 能【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[2] 六足【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[3] 也【大】，〔－〕【甲】`

### Why This Section Matters

Section 20 is the macro-index for the rest of the 化城 sequence.

It tells us where each doctrinal move belongs before we enter detailed sub-arguments.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 三品經文 | Three-chapter text segment | Three-unit movement map | Declares macro scope |
| 領解 / 述成 / 得記 | Understanding / confirmation / receiving prophecy | Reception-confirmation-certification chain | Shows nested pedagogical flow |
| 久遠知見 | Long-ago knowledge and vision | Deep-time seeing register | Grounds authority of retrospective teaching |
| 遠由 / 近由 | Remote cause / near cause | Long arc / immediate trigger | Organizes causal ladder |
| 大通智勝佛 | Great Universal Wisdom Excellence Buddha | Deep-history awakening pivot | Anchors narrative authority for lower-root guidance |
| 三轉法輪 | Three-turn Dharma wheel | Show/urge/verify cycle | Defines pedagogical repetition mechanics |

### The Lesson

Before the line goes deep, Zhiyi gives us the map.
That map is mercy for readers who could get lost in scale.

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] F07-B20 long architecture chain preserved.
- [x] Three-chapter nesting logic preserved.
- [x] Remote/near causal ladder preserved.
- [x] Full B20 witness bundle preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
