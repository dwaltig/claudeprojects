### The Setup

Now listen.

This is the section where Zhiyi refuses spiritual elitism.

Question: if human-and-deva small goodness usually ripens as karmic reward, why say these acts "already become Buddha-way"?

Answer: because once expedient lock is opened, even tiny good can function as causal-seed for full awakening trajectory.

---

### Three Buddha-Natures in Play

Zhiyi frames this through Buddha-nature logic:

- direct cause
- conditional cause
- discerning cause

Small acts (bowing, offering, image-making, even scattered forms of recollection) can serve as **conditional-cause seeds** when read inside opened-One-Vehicle architecture.

So "small" does not mean spiritually irrelevant.

---

### The Mountain-Basket Image

He uses the classic scaling metaphor:

- first basket of earth starts a mountain
- first hair's breadth starts great accumulation

The teaching claim: minor gestures in right relation are not lost. They accumulate toward One-Vehicle realization.

---

### Human and Deva Karma as Entry Bands

Zhiyi maps many concrete acts into human/deva karmic bands, including:

- building stūpas
- making images
- offering with focused or scattered mind
- bodily reverence forms
- verbal homage (including "Namo Buddha")

He also preserves practical vinaya-ethical concerns around materials, purity, and image-making conduct, showing that devotional form and ethical discipline are not separable.

---

### "Namo Buddha" as Rescue Signal

Zhiyi compiles examples to show that even crisis-level utterance of homage can become a turning condition.

The famous analogy: stone sinks alone, but stones on a boat do not sink. Likewise, ordinary karmic gravity can be redirected by Buddha-power when sincere recollection hooks into it.

This is not magic bypass. It is condition-shift under refuge connection.

---

### Why the Past-Buddha Gate Gets the Broad Five-Vehicle Display

He is asked why this broad five-vehicle expansion appears under past Buddhas.

Answer: past-cycle evidence is "proven" rather than merely projected. Future is not yet arisen; present is in progress; past gives full verification that opening provisional and revealing real actually matures beings into Four-Ones completion.

Demonstrated lineage, not abstract assertion.

---

### Why This Section Matters

This section guards against two errors:

- dismissing small good as spiritually useless
- mistaking small-good inclusion for denial of One-Vehicle ultimacy

Zhiyi keeps both: nothing wholesome is wasted, and all wholesome is gathered toward full awakening.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 小善 | Small good | Small note with long decay | Micro-practice with long causal reach |
| 緣因佛性 | Conditional-cause Buddha-nature | Seed that needs rain and season | Explains how tiny acts can mature toward bodhi |
| 低頭舉手 | Lowering head, raising hand | Minimal-body homage cue | Example of tiny act entering big trajectory |
| 南無佛 | Namo Buddha | Emergency refuge call | Verbal act with heavy karmic-redirection potential |
| 四一 | Four Ones | Four-channel completion mix | Endpoint language for matured reception |
| 施權顯實 | Apply provisional, reveal real | Use the demo to deliver the master | Overarching pedagogical architecture |

### The Lesson

Zhiyi's pastoral rigor is clear: do not despise beginning gestures. Under right teaching conditions, even scattered devotion can become entry into the One Real. Small acts are not the destination, but they are real doors.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Human/deva small-good question retained with doctrinal answer.
- [x] Three Buddha-nature framing preserved.
- [x] Micro-act accumulation metaphors preserved.
- [x] Devotional examples retained without stripping ethical-vinaya concerns.
- [x] "Namo Buddha" rescue logic preserved as conditional-power, not cheap shortcut.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
