### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi follows the reception point with growth mechanics.

The chain is practical:

- beings hear
- seeds activate
- increase occurs by measure
- the parable thread is re-lifted to keep interpretation stable

---

### What This Increase Is

Growth is not random emotional uplift.

It is structured maturation:

- roots strengthen
- branches differentiate
- function expands according to each class

So "increase" means doctrinal uptake becoming durable in life-practice.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B07 apparatus continuity:

- `[3] 正合【大】，合正【甲】`
- `[4] 世【大】，〔－〕【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 07 protects continuity between distribution and effect.

Without this unit, rain-language sounds universal but leaves no account of how maturation actually unfolds.

| 增長譬 | Growth parable | Maturation engine image | Explains post-hearing development |

### The Lesson

Hearing is a beginning.
