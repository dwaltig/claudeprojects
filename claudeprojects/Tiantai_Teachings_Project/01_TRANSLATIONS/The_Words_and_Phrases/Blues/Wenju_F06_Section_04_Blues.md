### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi marks the transition:

the verse now moves from general parable coverage into the specific parable sequence.

He says this specific-verse block has thirty-two-and-a-half lines and, in this opening unit, compresses three functions:

1. seeing
2. what is seen
3. startled compassion

---

### Hearing-as-Seeing Shift

He notes a key hermeneutic move:

where prose says "seeing," the verse may say "hearing."

This is not contradiction; hearing can stand in for seeing in the commentary's reading logic.

---

### "Standing Outside the Gate"

"Standing outside the gate" is read as:

- already secure from the burning field
- yet refusing to abandon beings
- remaining in compassionate readiness, not resting in isolated emptiness

---

### Witness Discipline

This short pivot retains apparatus continuity:

- `[2] 也【大】，〔－〕【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 04 is the hinge that hands us from macro-fire analysis to the concrete rescue sequence.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 別譬偈 | Specific parable verses | Detail-lane verse run | Marks shift from general map to specific sequence |
| 能見 / 所見 / 驚怖 | Seer / seen / startled compassion | See, diagnose, respond | Three-function opening compression |
| 以聞代見 | Use hearing in place of seeing | Indirect perception stands in | Hermeneutic substitution rule |
| 門外立 | Standing outside the gate | Safe position, rescue posture | Compassion without re-immersion |
| 法身地 | Dharmakāya ground | Stable realization base | Perspective from which rescue operates |
| 大悲不坐空座 | Great compassion not seated in empty-only seat | Refusal of detached quietism | Motivates return toward beings |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi pivots fast: true safety is not withdrawal; it is the stance that can still rescue.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] B04 three-function opening preserved.
- [x] Hearing-for-seeing hermeneutic preserved.
- [x] "Outside gate" compassion posture preserved.
- [x] Witness `[2]` preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
