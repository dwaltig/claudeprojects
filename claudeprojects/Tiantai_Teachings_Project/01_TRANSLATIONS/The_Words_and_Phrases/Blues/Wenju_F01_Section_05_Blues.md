Now listen.

Zhiyi doesn't just announce the Four Methods and ask you to trust him. He goes to the Album — the Lotus Sutra itself — and pulls the passages that prove each method works. This section is the evidence room. Every claim gets a citation.

## Part 1: Evidence for Causes and Conditions

Zhiyi starts with the big one — the thesis statement of the entire Lotus:

> "The *Skillful Means Chapter* states: 'The Buddhas of the ten directions appear in the world for the sake of the One Great Matter of causes and conditions.'"

**一大事因緣** — The One Great Matter. That's why all Buddhas appear. Not to teach meditation as a self-help technique. Not to offer moral guidelines. To open beings to the Buddha's knowledge and vision. Everything else is setup.

Then Zhiyi unpacks what "one," "great," and "matter" mean:

> "True Mark (*shíxiàng*) is called 'one'; vast and comprehensive is called 'great'; the Buddha points to this as the 'matter,' appearing in the world — this is the One Great Matter of causes and conditions."

The "One" = reality itself. The "Great" = it's universal. The "Matter" = this is actual, concrete, here.

And what if someone thinks the purpose is just human welfare or arhatship?

> "If it were merely teaching human and celestial vehicles, or the Lesser Vehicle, it would be neither 'one' nor 'great,' and moreover it would not constitute 'the Buddha's affair,' thus failing to establish the resonance between capacity and response."

Lesser teachings happen. But they're not the final word. The final word is always: *return to the One Great Matter*.

## Part 2: Evidence for According to Teaching

The Skillful Means Chapter again:

> "'By means of various Dharma gates, the Buddhas proclaim and reveal the Buddha-path.' You should understand: the various verbal teachings, whether subtle or manifest, whether provisional or real, all serve as fish-traps and rabbit-snares for the Buddha-path."

Fish-traps and rabbit-snares — from Zhuangzi. You use the trap to catch the fish, then you throw away the trap. You use the snare to catch the rabbit, then you forget the snare.

All the earlier teachings — Tripiṭaka, Shared, Distinct — are tools. Useful. Necessary. But not the destination.

The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* confirms:

> "Coarse speech and soft speech both return to the First Meaning."

Harsh polemics. Gentle encouragement. Gradual paths. Sudden revelations. They all converge at the same point.

## Part 3: Evidence for Fundamental and Trace

Now the Lifespan Chapter — the second half of the Album, where the eternal Buddha is revealed:

> "'Now gods, humans, and asuras all think that I, when young, left home, departed the Śākya palace, and at a place not far from Gayā City attained supreme perfect enlightenment. However, I actually achieved Buddhahood limitless, boundless *asaṃkhyeya* kalpas ago, and by these expedient means guide and benefit sentient beings.'"

The historical Buddha was born, practiced, awakened under the Bodhi tree. That's the Trace.

But the Buddha himself says: *I was already enlightened.* For incalculable eons. The life in India was a manifestation — a performance for beings who needed to see the process.

And it's not just the Buddha. The *Five Hundred Disciples Chapter*:

> "'Inwardly they keep secret the bodhisattva practices; outwardly they manifest as śrāvakas. In reality they purify their own Buddha-lands, yet show to the multitude the appearance of possessing the three poisons, and even manifest the marks of wrong views. My disciples are like this, using expedient means to liberate sentient beings.'"

Even the senior disciples are playing a role. Śāriputra's "true name" is Golden Dragon Intelligence Buddha. He's not a new practitioner working toward Buddhahood — he's already a Buddha, appearing in disguise to help beings.

> "Thus both master and disciples illuminate the structure of Original and Trace."

## Part 4: Evidence for Contemplating the Mind

Finally, the Parables Chapter:

> "'If a person has faith in what you proclaim, they thereby see me, and also see you, as well as the bhikṣu saṅgha and the bodhisattvas.'"

Pay attention. The Buddha says: *faith is seeing*. If you believe the teaching, you're not just getting information — you're encountering the Three Jewels directly.

Zhiyi unpacks it:

> "Hearing the teaching is the Dharma Jewel. Seeing me is the Buddha Jewel. Seeing you and the others is the Saṅgha Jewel."

Your faith, right now, is the site of encounter. The Buddha isn't just in India 2,500 years ago. The Buddha is in the moment of your understanding.

This is the Contemplating the Mind method: stop treating the text as external. Recognize that the Buddha's wisdom and your mind are the same in nature.

## Part 5: Applying the Methods to the Three Divisions

Zhiyi then shows how the four methods map onto the Threefold Division (Sequence, Main, Circulation):

**Causes and Conditions across the Three Divisions:**

- The distant past = planting the seeds
- The intermediate past = ripening
- The present = liberation

The Bodhisattvas Emerging from the Earth prove it: they're disciples from immeasurable kalpas ago, appearing now to receive the Dharma. The whole timeline is one continuous causal chain.

**Teaching across the Three Divisions:**

- The Sequence is not a preface for "human and deva" ethics — it's a preface for the Perfect Teaching.
- The Main Division points to "sunlight All-Knowledge" — not firefly-light analytical wisdom.
- The Circulation doesn't circulate the "half-word" provisional teachings — it circulates the full word.

**Fundamental and Trace across the Three Divisions:**

- If Buddhas are compared across time, it's "without end" — infinite regression.
- Zhiyi cuts it: take the first teaching of the Lotus at Śākyamuni's *first* awakening (immeasurable kalpas ago) as the Original. Everything since is Trace.

**Contemplating the Mind across the Three Divisions:**

- The Sequence = Precepts (preparation)
- The Main = Concentration (practice)
- The Circulation = Wisdom (realization)

Or: the Three Truths — Empty, Provisional, Middle — as the threefold division within a single thought.

**The Lesson**: Zhiyi doesn't just claim. He cites. Every method is backed by passages from the Album itself. If you think the Four Methods are arbitrary, read this section again. The proof is in the Sutra.
