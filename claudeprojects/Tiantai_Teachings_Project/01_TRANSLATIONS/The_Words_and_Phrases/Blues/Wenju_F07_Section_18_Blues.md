### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi opens 化城 by defining both terms at function level:

- "化" is transformation-work produced through spiritual power
- "城" is defensive structure that wards off harm and secures passage

Then he maps this inwardly:

the two-vehicle nirvana served here is a provisional strategic construction.

---

### Doctrinal Engine

This unit is not dismissing nirvana language.

It is specifying mode:

- through provisional wisdom, what is not ultimately fixed is spoken as if established
- teaching is deployed as protective city-work
- this grants rest, redirects fear, and leads onward
- because it is temporary establishment, it is called "Magic City"

So the city is a compassionate staging ground, not the final treasure destination.

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B18 apparatus continuity:

- `[3] 病【大】，〔－〕【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 18 defines the core grammar for everything in 化城喻品:

provisional structure can be fully valid in function while not ultimate in endpoint.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 化 | Transformation (by spiritual power) | Compassion-made staging reality | Explains temporary but effective pedagogical construction |
| 城 | City/fortification | Protective rest-station | Names defensive aid against fear and error |
| 權智所為 | Done by provisional wisdom | Skillful strategic build | Grounds why "city" can be taught without being ultimate |
| 用教為化 | Using teaching as transformation | Doctrine-as-shelter deployment | Converts instruction into lived protection |
| 防思禦見 | Guarding against thought/error and views | Mind-defense rail | Describes therapeutic containment of delusive patterns |
| 權假施設 | Provisional temporary establishment | Time-bound compassionate setup | Confirms non-final status of the city |

---

### The Lesson

A good guide may build a shelter that is not the destination.
The shelter is true in function, and still not the final home.

---
