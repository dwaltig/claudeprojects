### The Setup

Now listen.

The "是諸沙彌等" segment opens a long verse macro-chain.

Zhiyi decomposes the sequence so no clause drifts out of role.

This is a high-density structural passage requiring ordered partitioning.

---

### Decomposition Function

The section does three heavy lifts:

- partitions long verse into interpretable units
- preserves internal sequence logic
- keeps narrative and doctrinal vectors aligned through complexity

This is where weak reading habits usually collapse.
Zhiyi prevents that collapse by disciplined segmentation.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B37 apparatus continuity:

- `[3] 等【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[4] 次【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[5] 後【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[6] 三【大】，一【甲】`
- `[7] 日【大】，日還【甲】`
- `[8] 文【大】，文有【甲】`
- `[9] 二【大】，兩【甲】`
- `[10] 直【大】，真【甲】`
- `[11] 第四【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[12] 道【大】，導【甲】`

### Why This Section Matters

Section 37 is a complexity-control node.

It preserves readability and auditability through a passage that could otherwise blur into undifferentiated commentary mass.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 沙彌等 | The shramanera group | Novice-heir cohort | Marks a key collective actor in verse flow |
| 宏鏈 | Macro-chain | Extended linked sequence | Signals multi-part structured continuity |
| 分解序列 | Decomposition sequence | Clause-by-clause breakdown rail | Maintains order in dense passages |
| 文義對鎖 | Text-meaning mutual lock | Surface-depth alignment | Prevents free-floating paraphrase drift |
| 長段稽核 | Long-segment auditability | Checkable complex unit | Keeps large blocks verifiable |
| 重段節點 | Heavy segment node | High-load interpretive checkpoint | Alerts reader to structure-critical terrain |

---

### The Lesson

Long passages need strong joints.
Without structure, memory leaks and meaning bends.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] F07-B37 long verse chain preserved.
- [x] Decomposition logic preserved.
- [x] Clause-role sequencing preserved.
- [x] Full B37 witness bundle preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
