### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi opens the entrustment movement with two macro stages:

1. receiving/leading phase
2. formal handing-over phase

He then overlays a five-flavor teaching arc to explain the long conditioning process.

---

### Near and Far Causes

He names remote and near causes for final entrustment:

- remote: earlier labor, wages, training, trust-building
- near: mutual confidence, intention maturity, readiness to inherit

So final handoff is cumulative, not sudden.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 37 is the doctrinal compression of the whole pedagogical timeline into a readable transfer logic.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves:

- `[1] 車【大】，大車【甲】`
- `[2] 位【大】，味【甲】`
- `[3] 革【大】，隔【甲】`
- `[4] 之【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[5] 說【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[6] 以【大】，已【甲】`
