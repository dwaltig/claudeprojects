### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi addresses Kasyapa directly and turns the metaphor into doctrinal matching.

The move is explicit:

- show how the rain image maps to teaching function
- show how capacities differ without leaving Buddha intention
- show how each receives timely benefit according to what it can bear

---

### Sixfold Matching Drift-Control

This unit keeps the six-part sequence operational:

- field and receivers are named
- rain-teaching is distributed
- uptake follows capacity
- growth unfolds according to type

No receiver is outside the rain, but not all receivers metabolize it at the same pace.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B06 apparatus continuity:

- `[1] 時【大】，時也【甲】`
- `[2] 即【大】，即是【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 06 prevents two errors at once:

- flattening all capacities into one immediate result
- splitting capacities so hard that equal rain disappears

Zhiyi keeps calibrated difference inside universal nourishment.

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 汝等迦葉 | You all, Kasyapa | Direct receiver address | Marks interpretive precision turn |
| 合譬 | Matching the parable | Image-to-doctrine lock | Converts metaphor into technical reading |
| 隨其所堪 | According to what each can bear | Capacity-fit delivery | Prevents overreach and underfeed |

### The Lesson

Universal compassion does not erase capacity.
It meets each life where it can actually receive.
