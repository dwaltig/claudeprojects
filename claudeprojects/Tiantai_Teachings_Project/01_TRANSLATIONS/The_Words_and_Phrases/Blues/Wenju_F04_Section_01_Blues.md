### The Setup

Now listen.

Fascicle 4 opens with no warm-up. Zhiyi takes us straight into the core run from "Śāriputra, you asked three times" and says: this whole stretch works one problem, **opening the three and revealing the one**.

He marks seven-and-a-half chapters, then gives three turns:

1. Dharma-statement for superior roots.
2. Parable-statement for middle roots.
3. Past-causes-and-conditions statement for lower roots.

He also says this can be read as principle, events, and practice. Same teaching body, different listener entries.

---

### The Ten-Meaning Board

Before he argues details, he lays down ten diagnostics:

1. General and distinct.
2. Voice-hearer present or absent.
3. Delusion thick or thin.
4. Root turns or does not turn.
5. Root awakens or does not awaken.
6. Receives understanding or not.
7. Gets prediction or not.
8. Awakening shallow or deep.
9. Benefit provisional or real.
10. Waits for the proper time or does not.

This is method control. Zhiyi is telling us: do not read by mood; read by tested categories.

---

### One Turn, Three Payloads

Then the question hits:

If three turns answer three root-types, and each turn can contain all three statement-modes, does one statement then carry all three root-types?

Zhiyi answers: effectively yes.

A turn is named by its dominant target, not by exclusive membership. The first turn is called "for superior roots" because that is its main line, but it still reaches middle and lower capacities. Same logic for the others.

This is a classic Tiantai move: keep distinctions, reject rigid partitions.

---

### The Voice-Hearer Dispute

Now he enters direct polemic.

One school says real-practice voice-hearers are truly present. Another says none are truly present and cites scripture to support that.

Zhiyi says both positions break if treated as absolutes.

- If voice-hearers are absolutely real, how do you read Lotus lines saying there are no voice-hearer disciples, only bodhisattvas being transformed?
- If voice-hearers are absolutely absent, who enters the phantom city? What is the provisional leading if there is no "three" to gather?

Then comes the decisive image:

From the elder's real wisdom, no hired laborer is truly there.  
From the poor son's own capacity, he still names himself hired labor.

One event, two standpoints. If you flatten standpoint, you lose the sutra's logic chain.

---

### Four Types, Then a Fifth in Scope

Zhiyi cites the *Lotus Treatise* and gives four voice-hearer types:

1. Determinate.
2. Overweening.
3. Retreating from the Great.
4. Responsive transformation.

The first two are not yet ripe for prediction; the latter two receive prediction.

Then he says: read this sutra in its own frame and you should articulate five in operational scope. He starts with those long-trained in the small vehicle, maturing in this life, certifying fruit upon hearing small teaching.

He is not erasing distinctions. He is tightening them to the Lotus frame.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 開三顯一 | Open the Three, Reveal the One | Breaking out the three cuts to reveal the one master track | Governing structure of this chapter run |
| 三周 | Three Rounds/Turns | Three turns of the same sermon body | Root-targeted teaching sequence |
| 通/別 | General/Distinct | Shared payload and named lead line | How one turn can carry more than its label |
| 有聲聞/無聲聞 | Voice-hearer present/absent | Presence and absence under different standpoints | Anti-absolutist doctrinal test |
| 化城 | Magic/Phantom City | The phantom city rest stop | Provisional destination inside larger path |
| 偏執 | One-sided attachment | Grabbing one side and calling it final | Error Zhiyi rejects in both camps |

### The Lesson

This section is a gatekeeper. Zhiyi does not let us enter Track 2 with sloppy categories. He gives the three-turn map, then the ten-meaning board, then forces us through a dispute where both extremes fail. His point is not compromise for its own sake. His point is that Lotus logic is capacity-sensitive without becoming relativistic, and real-claiming without becoming rigid. If we can hold elder-vision and poor-son standpoint together, we can hear the chapter the way it is built.

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] All major classifications preserved (three turns, ten meanings, four voice-hearer types, five-in-scope note).
- [x] Q/A logic preserved (one-turn/three-root question and response maintained).
- [x] Polemical structure preserved (both absolutist positions tested and rejected).
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes / listening guide; no Repair Shop drift).
- [x] Doctrinal terms retained where precision is required (phantom city, prediction, provisional/real).
