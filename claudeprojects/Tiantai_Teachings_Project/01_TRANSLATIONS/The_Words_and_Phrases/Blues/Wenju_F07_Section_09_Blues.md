### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi sharpens the asymmetry:

- beings receive rain but do not fully know their own grade and destination
- the Tathagata knows each root, trajectory, and fruition without obstruction

---

### Why the Asymmetry Matters

This is not to humiliate beings.

It is to establish epistemic order:

- learner-side awareness is partial
- Buddha-side diagnostic knowing is complete

That is why guidance can be precisely fitted rather than generally announced.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B09 apparatus continuity:

- `[3] 秖【大】，只【甲】`
- `[4] 念【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[5] 境【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[6] 亦【大】，〔－〕【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 09 secures trust in adaptive teaching.

If all agents already fully knew their own scope, graded instruction would be unnecessary.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 不自覺知 | Not self-aware, not self-knowing | Self-diagnostic limit | Explains why beings misread their own stage |
| 如來能知 | Tathagata is able to know | Perfect diagnostic knowledge | Grounds adaptive Dharma delivery |
| 種性差別 | Difference of seed-nature | Root-profile diversity | Explains tailored instruction necessity |
| 所歸趣 | Destination-tendency | Where the line is heading | Tracks near and far fruits |
| 權智照機 | Provisional wisdom illuminates capacities | Fit-by-fit reading light | Matches medicine to actual condition |
| 實智遍照 | Real wisdom illuminates all | Total field illumination | Holds whole map without exclusion |

---

### The Lesson

We often cannot read our own depth.
The Buddha reads the whole ledger and teaches accordingly.
