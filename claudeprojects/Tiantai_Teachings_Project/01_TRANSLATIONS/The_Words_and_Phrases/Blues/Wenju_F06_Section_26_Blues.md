### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi isolates the father's sorrow phase.

He distinguishes:

- regret over insufficient former instruction
- resentment over the child's estrangement

This is not emotional excess; it is transmission anxiety.

---

### "Old Age" Re-read

"Old age" here is read as nearing the end of a teaching phase
without clear heir to carry the great household.

So sorrow concerns continuity of dharma transfer, not merely personal loneliness.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 26 makes explicit the urgency behind subsequent recovery actions.

Transmission fear sharpens compassion method.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves:

- `[3] 人【大】，民【甲】`
- `[4] 拜【大】，行【甲】`
- `[5] 悔恨【大】，恨悔【甲】`
- `[6] 令【大】，〔－〕【甲】`

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 念失子之苦 | Suffering of thinking of lost child | Grief ledger | Names sustained concern phase |
| 悔恨 | Regret and resentment | Self-blame and relational ache | Twofold emotional logic in this block |
| 不勤教詔 | Not diligently instructing | Insufficient early formation | Cause of later drift in Zhiyi's reading |
| 老朽 | Old and worn | End-of-phase transmission urgency | Signals concern about lineage continuation |
| 無傳大法之人 | No inheritor of great dharma | No steward in sight | Core anxiety driver |
| 內合 | Inner correspondence | Doctrinally mapped affect | Converts emotion into teaching-logic |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi lets sorrow speak so that responsibility for transmission cannot be sentimentalized away.
