**Lotus Chapter Covered**: Fascicle 8 mapped block from WENJU session source-lock cards

### The Setup

Now listen.

This section carries mapped block `F08-B46` as defined in the audited workboard.

Source scope in this block:

- T1718_008.txt lines 333-335 四安樂行 taxonomy + 行近 analysis chain + lines 337-338 apparatus ([5]/[6])

---

### Argument Flow

This unit is handled as a source-locked chain:

- keep the mapped clause order intact
- preserve doctrinal handoff from prior block
- maintain restart-safe continuity for the next block

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves mapped witness scope:

- `[5]`
- `[6]`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 46 keeps Fascicle 8 deterministic and auditable.

By pinning tone-pass prose to the existing source-lock card, we preserve meaning while sustaining the Blues register.
