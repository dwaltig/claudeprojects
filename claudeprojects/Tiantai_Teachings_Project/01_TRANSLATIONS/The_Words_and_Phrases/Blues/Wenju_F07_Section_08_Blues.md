### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi now states the equalizing heart of the chapter:

- one phase
- one flavor
- one wisdom-ground destination

Difference in reception remains real, but final Dharma taste is not divided.

---

### Equality without Flattening

This unit does not cancel graded instruction.

It clarifies the relation:

- provisional distributions differ
- Real destination does not differ

So non-difference is terminal truth, not pedagogical uniformity at every moment.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B08 apparatus continuity:

- `[1] 李【大】，梅【甲】`
- `[2] 差【大】，〔－〕【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 08 is the doctrinal hinge between capacity plurality and ultimate non-duality.

Without this hinge, readers either collapse difference too early or lose equality altogether.
