### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi now shifts from root-speed diagnostics to reporting language:

- Who is said to awaken?
- Who is said to "receive understanding" in the text?
- Why are some groups named and others absorbed into broader labels?

This section is less about poetry and more about category discipline.

### Meaning 5: Awakening Is Not Locked to One Group at One Moment

A common shortcut says:

- Bodhisattvas = superior root
- Pratyekabuddhas = middle root
- Voice-hearers = lower root

Then people force a rigid timeline: superior awakens in Dharma exposition, middle in parable exposition, lower in causes-and-conditions exposition.

Zhiyi says: not necessarily.

In the Lotus text stream, pratyekabuddhas are often counted inside the voice-hearer grouping when they meet a Buddha in the world. So their awakening may be present without a separate label every time.

He cites lines like "those seeking pratyekabuddha" inside the four assemblies to show they are not absent, just not always separately tagged.

Then he pushes further:

Do not confine bodhisattva awakening to the earliest segment only. If that were true, later chapter-by-chapter awakenings (including non-arising endurance gains and bodhi-mind arousal) would become unintelligible.

His position: bodhisattva awakening runs across the whole arc, beginning to end.

### Q/A: If Bodhisattvas Awaken Across the Arc, Do Two Vehicles Also Do So?

Question: If bodhisattva awakening stretches from start to finish, should two-vehicle awakening also be treated that way?

Zhiyi's answer: once the three cycles establish same father-son nature, all are named in bodhisattva terms regarding this awakening direction. Even if realization appears later, it is still treated inside that bodhisattva-facing horizon.

This is reclassification by revealed nature, not erasure of process history.

### Meaning 6: Why "Receiving Understanding" Is Mostly Marked on Voice-Hearers

Another question follows naturally:

If all three vehicle-lines can awaken, why does the sutra mostly show voice-hearers giving explicit "we now understand" declarations?

Zhiyi gives a layered answer.

1. **Category absorption:** pratyekabuddha cases are often included within voice-hearer framing, so not every instance is listed separately.
2. **Rhetorical need:** voice-hearer lineages previously lacked explicit Buddhahood-confirming language; when Lotus opens their return route, explicit voiced-understanding matters.
3. **Bodhisattva position depth:** bodhisattva trajectory is already broad and deep in prior/later textual development, so "receiving understanding" is not always performed in the same way.

He also notes transmission economy: not every Indic detail is always expanded in Chinese redaction.

Bottom line: textual visibility of "receiving understanding" is strategic, not evidence of exclusion.

### The Structural Point

Zhiyi keeps one principle steady:

Follow meaning, not surface counting.

A label in one passage may be a broad container. A silence in one passage may be covered by another chapter's explicit statement. If you force every group to be named at every line, you break the sutra's own editorial logic.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 有悟不悟 | Having awakening / not having awakening | Waking line or still-dim line | Tests where awakening is actually occurring |
| 領解 | Receiving understanding | Giving your witness statement | Formal voiced-understanding marker |
| 四眾 | Four assemblies | The whole room in the hall | Shared audience frame that can include sub-groups |
| 緣覺 | Pratyekabuddha / conditioned awakening | Middle-listener line | Sometimes named directly, sometimes absorbed in larger grouping |
| 無生法忍 | Endurance of the unproduced | Non-breaking witness under pressure | Marker of deepening bodhisattva realization |
| 同名菩薩悟 | Same-name bodhisattva awakening | One revealed family-name on the record | Reclassification after same-nature determination |

---

### The Lesson

This section teaches reading ethics. Do not mistake naming frequency for doctrinal rank, and do not mistake compressed reporting for absence. Zhiyi is showing that awakening can be present across different listener-lines while the text chooses specific moments for explicit testimony. If we keep forcing rigid one-label-per-line accounting, we miss the way Lotus integrates process, audience, and revelation.

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Meaning 5 preserved: awakening distribution is not rigidly confined to one early slice.
- [x] Meaning 6 preserved: rationale for voice-hearer-weighted "receiving understanding" reporting retained.
- [x] Key Q/A preserved (two-vehicle awakening placement after same-nature determination).
- [x] Chapter-cross references retained at conceptual level (later-stage bodhisattva gains and witness pattern).
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
- [x] No doctrinal inversion introduced (category absorption explained without denying distinctions).
