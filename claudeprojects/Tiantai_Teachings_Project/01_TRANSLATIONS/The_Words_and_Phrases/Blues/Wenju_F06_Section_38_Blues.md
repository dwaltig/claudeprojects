### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi divides this part into:

1. mutual trust-confirmation
2. command to receive and manage household work

"As-if son" matures toward explicit naming and responsibility.

---

### Trust Before Transfer

He treats trust as two-way:

- child trusts father's promise is real
- father trusts child's capacity is now stable

Only then can real management be assigned.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 38 clarifies that inheritance is relationally verified before being legally/theologically declared.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves:

- `[7] 文【大】，文又【甲】`
- `[1] 云【大】，言【甲】`
- `[2] 命【大】，命令【甲】`
