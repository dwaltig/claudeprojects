### The Setup

Now listen.

With "諸比丘如來..." the text performs a direct matching move.

The parable thread is no longer left in image-space.
It is joined to doctrinal referent in ordered sequence.

---

### Join Discipline

This matching line prevents interpretive drift:

- image elements are re-bound to their intended meaning
- sequence is preserved so no layer is skipped
- prior symbolic movement is made accountable in explicit doctrinal speech

---

### Witness Discipline

This F07-B34 block is a line-271 join chain with no additional apparatus bundle in scope.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 34 is the hinge between metaphor and method.

Without strong join logic, readers can misapply the parable or over-literalize it.
