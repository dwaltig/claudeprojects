### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi zooms into the phrase "the child leaves the father and flees."

He gives a strict three-part reading:

- leaving father = retreat from the great
- fleeing = ignorance self-covering
- running on = movement toward birth-and-death circuitry

---

### "Young" and "Growing" Reframed

He rejects a simplistic "heard little/heard much" reading.

Instead:

- "young" means heavy obscuration and weak interpretive force
- "growing" means gradual perfuming by prior good roots

So maturation is not mere information quantity.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 22 fixes the lexicon for rupture: retreat is doctrinal and existential, not sentimental metaphor only.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves:

- `[＊5-2] 銷【大】＊，消【甲】＊`
- `[15] 穉【大】，稚【甲】`

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 子背父去 | Child turns away from father | Retreat from source-line | Names doctrinal rupture |
| 退大 | Retreat from the Great | Drop the high road | Core interpretive key for "leaving" |
| 無明自覆 | Ignorance self-covering | Mind pulls blinders over itself | Explains "fleeing" dynamic |
| 趣向生死 | Moving toward birth-death | Run back into the burn-cycle | Explains "running on" movement |
| 解心無力 | Interpretive heart without strength | Too weak to hold the line | Basis for "young" diagnosis |
| 熏被稍著 | Gradual perfuming and slight attachment | Slow warming to return-capacity | Basis for "growing" diagnosis |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi reads one short phrase as a full map of forgetting, covering, and drifting.

---
