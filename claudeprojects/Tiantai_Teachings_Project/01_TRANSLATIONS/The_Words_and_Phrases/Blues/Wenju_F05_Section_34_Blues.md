### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi now fuses (合) the parable mappings.

He critiques overly proliferated ten-parable schemes as cumbersome and non-convergent.

---

### Zhiyi's Integration Move

He instead combines:

- general parable layer
- specific parable layer

General has six components; current text merges them in non-rigid order.

So the key is doctrinal fit, not forced sequence literalism.

---

### Initial Correspondence Chain

He maps early correspondences:

- elder rank/virtue to Tathāgata titles
- nation-town-village scope to "all worlds" presence
- inner virtue to wisdom and severance powers
- outer wealth to power/fearlessness and skills
- compassion field to five destinies
- burning house to triple-world condition
- one gate to teaching that leads to bodhi

This stitches previous parable symbols into doctrinal unity.

### Witness Discipline

Variant pair preserved in this unit:

- `[1] 外德【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[2] 力【大】，力者【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 34 is the hinge between symbol and doctrinal completion.

It keeps the mapping engine coherent before the largest synthesis block.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 合譬 | Combining parables | Merge-map operation | Integrates symbolic layers into doctrinal reading |
| 總別雙合 | General/specific dual integration | Two-level lock-in | Prevents one-sided interpretation |
| 十譬繁而不會 | Ten parables too dense and not converging | Overbuilt schema drift | Critique of non-integrated classification |
| 一切世間 | All worlds | Full reception field | Correspondence for place-scope symbolism |
| 大慈大悲 | Great compassion | Rescue motive engine | Grounds transformation function |
| 佛教門 | Buddha-teaching gate | Doctrine-entry passage | Links instruction to liberation path |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi's hermeneutic is disciplined synthesis: enough distinctions to read clearly, enough integration to avoid fragmentation.

---
