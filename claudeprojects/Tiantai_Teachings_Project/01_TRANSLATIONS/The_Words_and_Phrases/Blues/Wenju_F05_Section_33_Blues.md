### The Setup

Now listen.

This line is brief and decisive:

Buddha's self-assertion after promising three and giving one would be harder;
Śāriputra's declaration is easier for trust.

---

### Why This Tiny Line Matters

It seals the prior Q&A with exact communicative strategy.

No surplus argument.

Just clean pedagogical realism.
