### The Setup

Now listen.

Before the burning-house parable opens, Zhiyi clarifies why this Śāriputra narrative appears here.

He is not doing casual placement notes. He is doing sequence control for how middle roots are brought online.

---

### Placement Debate

Zhiyi reports and tests views about where this section belongs:

- after devas' verse speech
- before the fire-house parable
- positioned as a receiving-understanding preface for parable unfolding

He rejects sentiment-only placement logic and insists on pedagogical fit.

---

### What "Receiving-Understanding" Means Here

He defines the section function:

- receive what was heard
- state what was understood

In prose, receiving and understanding are intertwined.

In verse, they are laid out distinctly.

So the text itself models two modes of integration: fused and articulated.

---

### Two Main Parts of the Narrative

Zhiyi sets a basic two-part frame:

1. narrator's account
2. Śāriputra's own statement

Then he subdivides narrator account into:

- inner understanding
- outer demeanor

Joy in mind, then joy moving the body: this is the embodied mark of real reception.

---

### Three Joys Entering the Field

He hints the "three joys" scaffold:

- wondrous speaker met
- wondrous Dharma heard
- wondrous understanding gained

Even one of these would provoke rejoicing. Three together produce full movement.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Without this narrative preface, parable can be heard as mere story.

With it, parable is tied to verified reception dynamics: hearing, understanding, embodiment, declaration.

This is middle-root ignition mechanics.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 領解段 | Receiving-understanding section | Catch the line, then name the line | Defines this unit's double function before parable expansion |
| 經家敘 | Narrator account | Session-room frame voice | Provides structural and affective staging |
| 身子自陳 | Śāriputra self-statement | Lead witness testimony | First-person confirmation of reception and shift |
| 內解 / 外儀 | Inner understanding / outer demeanor | Heart lock / body signal | Maps cognition and embodiment together |
| 踊躍歡喜 | Leaping joy | Full-body yes to the line | Reception marker of deep alignment, not superficial excitement |
| 三喜具足 | Three joys complete | Triple-lock reception state | Speaker, Dharma, and insight convergence |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi places Śāriputra's narrative as a tuning section: before parable does its heavy work, the text proves what authentic reception looks like. Middle roots need that bridge.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Placement-debate and sequence logic preserved.
- [x] Receiving/understanding dual function preserved (prose fused, verse separated).
- [x] Narrator vs self-statement structure preserved.
- [x] Inner/outer joy distinction preserved.
- [x] Three-joy setup preserved as reception architecture.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
