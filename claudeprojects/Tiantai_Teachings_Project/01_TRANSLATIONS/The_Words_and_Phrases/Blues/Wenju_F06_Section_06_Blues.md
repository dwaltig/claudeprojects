### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi says this verse unit covers the "set aside desk-plan, use carts" movement in two parts:

1. first five-and-a-half lines: rescue attempt fails
2. next seven-and-a-half lines: cart strategy deployed

---

### First Part: Warning Register in Focus

In prose, rescue-attempt had encouragement and warning strands.

In the prior synthesis, encouragement was foregrounded.

Here, Zhiyi says the verse foregrounds warning language instead.

He keeps the same three-step shape:

- proposed warning instruction
- children do not receive
- compassionate temporary release (pause of direct forcing)

---

### Second Part: Using Carts

The cart side keeps three operative functions in verse compression:

1. proposing the three carts
2. praising/urging/certifying their value
3. children responding according to wish

Zhiyi notes one prose element ("knowing prior inclinations") is not separately sung here.

Again, verse compresses without losing function.

---

### Witness Discipline

This B06 block carries apparatus continuity:

- `[3] 勸【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[4] 羊【大】，鹿【甲】`

These witnesses affect how the exhortation/showing sequence is read.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 06 is a method pivot in verse form:

when direct warning fails, the Dharma does not quit; it shifts to skillful offering.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 捨几用車 | Set aside desk-plan, use carts | Switch methods to save the line | Core strategic pivot |
| 誡文三義 | Three warning functions | Warn, refusal, pause | Verse rendering of failed direct rescue |
| 擬宜 | Proposed suitability | Offer matched to possible uptake | Initial teaching attempt move |
| 息化 | Pause of immediate transformation effort | Strategic release, not abandonment | Compassionate reset when no reception |
| 勸示證 | Urge, show, certify | Triple-offer cadence | Structure of cart presentation |
| 適子所願 | Fits the children's wish | Receiver-aligned uptake | Marks active response to skillful means |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi's verse logic is resilient compassion: form changes, intent does not.
