### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi maps the father's work-instruction language onto a seven-part path-training ladder:

1. four foundations
2. four right efforts
3. four bases of power
4. five faculties
5. five strengths
6. eightfold path
7. seven awakening factors (as ongoing practice shaping)

---

### Why This Mapping Matters

"Cleaning" is not menial metaphor only.

It encodes ordered practice development from outer training to near-truth and saintly stabilization.

Even "twenty years" receives multiple interpretive renderings across path frameworks.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 36 is a major doctrinal decoder ring for the whole labor phase.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves:

- `[5] 故【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[6] 支【大】，枝【甲】`
- `[7] 麪【大】＊，麵【甲】＊`

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 語諸作人 | Speak to the workers | Assign practice crew | Opens mapped training sequence |
| 除糞之器 | Tool for cleansing filth | Affliction-removal toolkit | Symbol for practice apparatus |
| 四念處…八正道 | Four foundations through eightfold path | Full training ladder | Progressive purification architecture |
| 二十年 | Twenty years | Long maturation interval | Multi-frame marker of gradual completion |
| 客作賤人 | Hired low worker self-view | Still not claiming inheritance | Self-position during training phase |

### The Lesson

Zhiyi transforms "work" into a full map of path maturation, one step at a time.
