### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi reads "grown older" and "turning toward home-country" through two triggers:

1. subtle root-perfuming toward the path
2. suffering pressure and loss-awareness that seek exit

These become the receptive knock on Buddha-compassion.

---

### Four-Direction Seeking

"Racing in four directions seeking clothing/food" is read as searching for path and supports.

He cautions: not every human/deva virtue stream is already direct Buddha-seeing condition.

Yet suffering-based seeking can become the opening.

---

### Country-City-House Distinction (Opened Here)

He begins differentiating:

- country as broad Buddha-dharma domain
- city as nirvāṇa defensive structure
- house as intimate same-body compassion space

This triad will control later mapping.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves:

- `[＊16-1] 反【大】＊，返【甲】＊`
- `[1] 之【大】，諸【甲】`
- `[A4] 經【CB】，輕【大】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 24 is the pivot from estrangement to directional return.

It also seeds the key country/city/house mapping grammar.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 向國而還 | Turn back toward home-country | Returnward trajectory | Recovery orientation marker |
| 遭苦失樂思求出要 | Encounter suffering, lose joy, seek exit | Pain-driven awakening pressure | First practical motive for return |
| 馳騁四方求衣食 | Race in four directions for clothing/food | Search for path and supports | Transitional seeking activity |
| 本國 / 城 / 舍 | Country / city / house | Broad domain / defended realization / intimate compassion space | Multi-scale doctrinal mapping |
| 厭苦求理 | Loathe suffering, seek principle | Raw opening tendency | Converts distress to search |
| 機扣佛 | Capacity knocking on Buddha | Signal-response initiation | Starts compassion engagement |

---

### The Lesson

Return begins when suffering is no longer normalized and the heart starts looking for the way out.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] B24 returnward two-trigger logic preserved.
- [x] Four-direction seeking interpretation preserved.
- [x] Country/city/house distinction opening preserved.
