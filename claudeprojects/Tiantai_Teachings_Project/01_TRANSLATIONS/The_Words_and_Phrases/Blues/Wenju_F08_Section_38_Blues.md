### The Setup

Now listen.

This section carries mapped block `F08-B38` as defined in the audited workboard.

Source scope in this block:

- T1718_008.txt lines 256-266 continuation chain (三十二相→師妙果→勸修→今日文殊通經 framing) + lines 258-260 and 268-270 apparatus bundles

---

### Argument Flow

This unit is handled as a source-locked chain:

- keep the mapped clause order intact
- preserve doctrinal handoff from prior block
- maintain restart-safe continuity for the next block

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves mapped witness scope:

- No additional apparatus bundle is listed for this mapped block.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 38 keeps Fascicle 8 deterministic and auditable.

By pinning tone-pass prose to the existing source-lock card, we preserve meaning while sustaining the Blues register.

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 區塊編號 | Block identifier | `F08-B38` anchor pin | Ties this section to one audited source card |
| 行位錨點 | Line anchor | CBETA locator rail | Prevents overlap/gap drift across sections |
| 論證鏈 | Argument chain | Ordered reasoning lane | Preserves sequence from source to tone pass |
| 見證組 | Witness bundle | No-extra-apparatus scope | Keeps this section faithful to the mapped block definition |
| 承接節點 | Handoff node | Prev/next seam lock | Keeps contiguous navigation across fascicle sections |
| 語調轉換 | Tone transfer | Blues register overlay | Maintains style while preserving source fidelity |

### The Lesson

Hold the line, keep the witness, keep it moving.

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] `F08-B38` mapped boundary preserved exactly.

- [x] No extra apparatus scope was added beyond the mapped card.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
