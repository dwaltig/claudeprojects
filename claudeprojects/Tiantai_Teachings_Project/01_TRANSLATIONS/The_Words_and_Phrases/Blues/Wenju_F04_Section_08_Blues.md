### The Setup

Now listen.

After the departure filtering scene, Zhiyi says we now enter the **proper extensive exposition**.

He splits it in two large movements:

1. Four-Buddha chapter (expanding how previous Buddhas handle provisional and real)
2. Śākyamuni chapter (expanding how the present Buddha handles provisional and real)

This is where the brief signals become full architecture.

---

### From Brief to Extensive: What Changes?

Zhiyi marks a threefold expansion:

- text expands (more clauses/sections)
- person-frame expands (multi-Buddha layering)
- meaning expands (six-turn explanatory sequence)

Then he names the six turns:

1. Praise the Dharma as rare.
2. Declare no falsehood.
3. Open expedients.
4. Show the real.
5. Use five-corruption conditions to explain why provisional speech was necessary.
6. Filter false grasping and press toward the real.

Important: each major chapter can contain all six by implication, but they are distributed across the flow rather than always fully repeated in one single local block.

So do not confuse distribution with omission.

---

### Why This Distribution Matters

Zhiyi says Buddha's skill here is brevity without loss and reach without clutter.

- enough said to prevent doctrinal hole
- not so much repeated that the line collapses into noise

He also says order is not absolutely fixed in every micro-instance. The sequence is stable as an architecture, flexible in local deployment.

That is high-level compositional control, not inconsistency.

---

### The Four-Buddha Chapter Opening

At the start of the Four-Buddha chapter, Zhiyi notes only four of the six turns appear explicitly at once:

- praise rarity
- no falsehood
- opening expedients
- showing real

The other two are carried later in the unfolding.

Then we get a timing key line: "only then does he speak it."

Zhiyi reads this as long-delay disclosure due to three conditions:

- people not yet ready
- timing not yet mature
- obstructive assembly factors not yet cleared

Once those conditions shift, decisive Great-Vehicle disclosure becomes proper.

---

### The Udumbara Image

The udumbara flower motif is read as rarity plus maturity marker.

It is not decorative mysticism. It means:

- long rarity of full disclosure
- only after maturation across prior teaching-flavor sequences does the deepest cut get dropped

In contemplative reading, mind-contemplation itself is called auspicious and spiritually potent when it penetrates toward Real Mark.

So symbol and method are linked.

---

### Why "You Should Believe" Appears Here

Zhiyi glosses this exhortation as anti-slander protection in a difficult transition:

- deeper principle than earlier phases
- wording that can sound opposite to prior framing
- wider practice claim than prior restricted claims

Because this turn can feel disruptive, exhortation to trust no-falsehood speech becomes necessary.

---

### The Lesson

This section teaches how Lotus expands: not by throwing away earlier lines, but by unfolding them into a fuller architecture at the right moment. Zhiyi's six-turn board is the map. If we read by isolated snippets, we think contradiction. If we read by distributed architecture, we hear compositional precision.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 廣說 | Extensive exposition | Full-length release cut | Transition from compressed signal to expanded explanation |
| 六番 | Six turns | Six-turn architecture board | Core explanatory sequence of this opening phase |
| 歎法希有 | Praise Dharma as rare | Name the rarity before the drop | Sets reverence posture for reception |
| 說無虛妄 | Speak no falsehood | This line has no fake notes | Anti-slander credibility anchor |
| 開方便 / 示真實 | Open expedients / show the real | Open the demo, reveal the master | Core Lotus conversion pattern |
| 時乃說之 | Only then speak it | Right-time release | Timing doctrine for full disclosure |

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Two-part macro structure preserved (Four-Buddha / Śākyamuni chapter split).
- [x] Six-turn sequence preserved with function labels.
- [x] Distributed-presence logic preserved (not all six forced into each local unit).
- [x] Timing rationale preserved for "only then does he speak it."
- [x] Udumbara symbolism kept functionally tied to maturation logic.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
