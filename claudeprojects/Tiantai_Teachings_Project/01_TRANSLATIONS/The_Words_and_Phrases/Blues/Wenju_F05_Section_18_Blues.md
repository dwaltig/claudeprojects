**Lotus Chapter Covered**: Track 3 — Parable (譬喻品), medium-root cycle setup and request architecture

### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi marks a major turn:

from this point, the text enters the medium-root parable cycle.

He maps the architecture before explanation begins.

---

### Four-Chapter Medium-Root Cycle

Zhiyi says this second large segment contains four chapter-functions:

1. **Parable chapter**: opening Three to reveal One through simile
2. **Faith-and-Understanding**: middle roots receiving understanding
3. **Medicinal Herbs**: Tathāgata narratively confirming
4. **Prediction**: formal bestowal

All four are read through the parable channel.

---

### Parallel Causal Cycle Below

He also says a lower four-part sequence will run by causal/condition logic:

- Chenru and pearl-cord cause connection
- Ānanda and Empty-King cause connection
- prediction consequences
- linked completion pattern

So simile and causal explanation run as mirrored pedagogical tracks.

---

### Request and Response: The Immediate Spine

Zhiyi compresses the operating structure:

- first: request
- second: response

The request has three parts:

1. self-statement of no doubt
2. statement that fellow practitioners still carry confusion
3. universal request for the four assemblies

---

### Why Confusion Persists

He names the core tension:

- attachment to former three-teaching deployment
- attachment to former one-principle reading

When earlier "three as final" and present "one as real" are not integrated, people fall into doubt.

That unresolved split generates the request.

---

### Witness Discipline in This Block

The line keeps paired apparatus readings for 同輩:

- `[1] 輩【大】＊，背【甲】＊`
- `[＊1-1] 輩【大】＊，背【甲】＊`

Zhiyi's argument assumes those witness variants are carried intact.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 18 is the map before the mountain road.

Without this frame, later parable detail looks sprawling.

With it, every move lands as part of a timed medium-root rescue design.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 中根譬說 | Parable for medium roots | Mid-room bridge teaching | Names the target receiver field |
| 文有四品 | Text has four chapters | Four-track session arc | Macro architecture for this segment |
| 請答 | Request and response | Ask-and-open spine | Immediate rhetorical engine |
| 同輩有惑 | Companions have doubt | Same-line confusion among peers | Grounds need for communal clarification |
| 四眾普請 | Universal request by four assemblies | Whole-room petition | Expands private doubt into collective teaching request |
| 因緣 parallel | Cause/condition parallel sequence | Backline causal mirror | Keeps parable and causal explanation synchronized |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi drafts the room before he runs the lesson. Structure itself is compassion.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Four-chapter medium-root architecture preserved.
- [x] Parable-track and cause-track parallelism preserved.
- [x] Request/response two-part spine preserved.
- [x] Threefold request structure preserved.
- [x] Doubt-cause logic (former-three / present-one tension) preserved.
- [x] Apparatus witness pair `[1]/[＊1-1]` preserved in analysis.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
