### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi notes a compositional shift: in prose, Five Corruptions were explicated after the Śākyamuni section; in verse, they are also placed at the end of the "All Buddhas" gate and then reappear.

His point is not editorial disorder.

His point is universal patterning:

All Buddhas entering five-corruption fields run the same compassionate sequence: **three first, one later**.

---

### Four-Part Breakdown of This Verse Unit

He divides the unit into four movements:

1. one line: in general, Five Corruptions obstruct the Great
2. six lines: in specific detail, five-corruption conditions obstruct reception routes
3. one line: because of that, Buddha expediently speaks the Small
4. one and a half lines: for the sake of the Great, the Small is used therapeutically so great-vow activation can rise

So this is not downshifting from Great intent. It is strategic sequencing under hostile conditions.

### "If I Meet Living Beings": What "Meeting" Means

Zhiyi layers "living beings" across scales:

- primordial world-emergence scale
- one-life aggregate-assembly scale
- karmic migration-through-five-destinies scale

Then he glosses "meeting":

- beings burn in suffering
- Buddhas move in great compassion
- suffering and compassion meet as operative opposite vectors

He adds the deeper line: Buddha-suchness and beings-suchness are one suchness, naturally responsive. So meeting is also ontological affinity, not only historical encounter.

### Why Not Teach Only Human-Deva, or Only Small, or Only Common/Distinct?

Zhiyi rejects all narrow options:

- human/deva-only instruction avoids some coarse suffering but does not complete Buddha-way disclosure
- small-vehicle-only route exits limited existential ranges but cannot be final full revelation
- common/distinct-only fixation risks one-sidedness and loss of Buddha knowledge-and-vision

Thus he restates the One-Vehicle intention:

Lead beings to real-mark wisdom where all dharmas are seen as Buddha-dharma and the true path is not fragmented.

### Why This Section Matters

This section prevents a familiar misunderstanding:

"If Buddha speaks Small first, then Small is final."

Zhiyi says no. Small-first under corruption pressure is therapeutic staging for Great fulfillment.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 先三後一 | First three, later one | Three-pass warmup before master line | Universal compassionate sequence in heavy-obstruction fields |
| 相遇 | Mutual meeting | Suffering-current meets compassion-current | Defines Buddha-beings encounter as functional and ontological |
| 天性相關 | Natural affinity relation | Same root-tone resonance | Grounds why "meeting" can occur beyond surface circumstance |
| 方便說小 | Expediently speak the Small | Low-gain channel for overloaded ears | Therapeutic pedagogical staging |
| 大願得興 | Great vow can arise | Master vow comes online | Goal-state after obstruction reduction |
| 佛知見 | Buddha knowledge-and-vision | Buddha-seeing channel | Non-negotiable destination criterion |

---

### The Lesson

All Buddhas in corrupted eras use fitted sequencing, not because truth is partial, but because ears are overloaded. The Great is never abandoned; it is protected, staged, and finally disclosed.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Verse/prose placement shift preserved without treating it as contradiction.
- [x] Four-part verse breakdown retained.
- [x] Multi-layer meanings of "living beings" preserved.
- [x] "Compassion meets suffering" and "one suchness" both retained.
- [x] Rejection of narrow-only pedagogies preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
