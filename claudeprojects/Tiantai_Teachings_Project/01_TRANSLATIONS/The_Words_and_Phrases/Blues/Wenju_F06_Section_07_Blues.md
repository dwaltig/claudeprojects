### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi says this seventeen-line verse unit sings the same four-part movement as the prose:

1. relief from danger
2. request for carts
3. equal granting of great carts
4. joy in receiving

---

### First Part: Relief and Joy

He divides the opening five lines into:

- one line for relief itself
- four lines for joy

"Sitting on the lion seat" is given two readings:

- children seated in fearlessness after leaving the three realms
- or the elder seated in fearlessness after seeing children safely out

Either way, fear shifts to fearless clarity.

---

### Second and Third Parts

The three-line request section follows plainly.

Then the seven-and-a-half-line giving section emphasizes:

- wealth-store abundance
- great cart chapter markers
- equality logic in the grant

Zhiyi notes verse selection is concise and does not re-sing every prose sub-division.

---

### Fourth Part: Joy as Free Movement

Final one-and-a-half lines present joy as free roaming:

- horizontal: four gates/four truths registers
- vertical: path stages through ultimate virtues

So "play" here is awakened ease, not delusive play.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves the B07 witness set:

`[5] [6] [7] [8] [9]`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 07 is the verse confirmation that equal great-vehicle bestowal is not accidental rhetoric; it is staged and complete.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

### The Lesson

In Zhiyi's score, equal giving ends in shared fearless movement, not in hierarchy anxiety.
