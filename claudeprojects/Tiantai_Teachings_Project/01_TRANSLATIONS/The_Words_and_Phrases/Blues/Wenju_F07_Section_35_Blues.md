### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi enters a metrical architecture unit,
organizing near/far causal basis into verse-ready sequence.

This is compression with structure, not compression with loss.

---

### Verse Function

The verse layer does three things:

- stabilizes memory pathways
- preserves ordered causal relation
- carries doctrinal distinctions in portable form

Near and far are kept relational, not adversarial.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B35 apparatus continuity:

- `[1] 也【大】，〔－〕【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 35 secures recitable precision.

Without architecture, verse can become merely lyrical; here it remains doctrinally indexed.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 偈體 | Verse form | Metered transmission frame | Packs doctrine into durable recitation form |
| 近遠由 | Near/far causal basis | Proximate and deep-time cause rails | Organizes layered causality |
| 壓縮不失序 | Compression without losing order | Tight form, intact sequence | Ensures brevity does not distort logic |
| 可誦可稽核 | Recitable and auditable | Mouth-ready and check-ready line | Preserves both liturgical and scholarly utility |
| 因由銜接 | Causal linkage | Cause-chain continuity | Prevents fragmented explanation |
| 偈中顯義 | Meaning revealed in verse | Doctrine in meter | Confirms verse as analytic medium |

---

### The Lesson

Short lines can still carry long truth
when the order is kept clean.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] F07-B35 verse-architecture chain preserved.
- [x] Near/far causal relation preserved.
- [x] Compression-without-loss principle preserved.
- [x] Witness `[1]` preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
