## What We Learned

1. **Every name is a teaching.** Zhiyi doesn't list Arhats — he decodes them. Each name carries etymology, biography, Four Siddhāntas, Four Teachings, Fundamental/Trace, and Contemplating the Mind.

2. **Residual habits don't disqualify.** Gavāmpati chewed. Pilindavatsa insulted. They were still front-row Arhats. Awakening coexists with quirks.

3. **The studio needs all kinds.** Vakkula never spoke. Mahākauṣṭhila won every argument. Pūrṇa would preach until beaten to death. Subhūti sat in a cave and saw the Dharma-body. All valid. All foremost.

4. **Family is complicated.** Ānanda and Rāhula were blood relatives of the Buddha. Neither entered easily. Both were essential.

5. **Numbers are contemplation keys.** 2000 Learners/No-Learners = 10 realms × 10 suchnesses × mutual interfusion. 6000 nuns = 6 faculties × 1000 merits.

6. **Everyone is playing a role.** The Arhats are trace-forms of bodhisattvas. The nuns are trace-forms of Great Beings. The entire assembly is Śūraṅgama power — the Dharmakāya scattering shadows.

## What's Ahead

Fascicle 2 covered the **śrāvaka assembly** (bhikṣus and bhikṣuṇīs). Fascicle 3 moves to:

- The **Bodhisattva assembly** (菩薩眾): 80,000 great beings
- The **Deva and Dragon assembly**: Indra, Brahmā, the Four Heavenly Kings, dragon kings, garuḍas, kinnaras, and more
- The **introduction of Mañjuśrī** and the prelude to the Buddha's teaching

The studio is staffed. The prelude is about to begin.
