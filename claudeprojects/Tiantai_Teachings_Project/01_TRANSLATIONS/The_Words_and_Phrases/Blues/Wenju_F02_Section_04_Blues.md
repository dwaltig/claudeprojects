Now listen.

Two masters. Two superlatives.

Pūrṇamaitrāyaṇīputra — foremost in preaching the Dharma. The one who could walk into hostile territory and keep teaching even if they cut him to pieces.

Subhūti — foremost in emptiness. The one who saw the Dharma-body first, from a stone cave, while everyone else crowded to bow to the Buddha's form.

## Pūrṇa (富樓那): Full Wish — Foremost in Preaching

### The Name

> "Pūrṇa (富樓那): translated as 'Full Wish.' His father prayed to Brahmā for a son by a river that was full. He dreamt of a seven-jeweled vessel filled with treasures entering the mother's womb. Because the father's wish was fulfilled, he is called 'Full Wish.'"

His mother was Maitrāyaṇī — "Compassionate Practice" — from the name of a Vedic section she recited. He was called "Son of Compassion" (*Cízǐ*). The *Ekottara* says:

> "My father was named Full, my mother was named Compassion; practitioners call me Full-Compassion Son."

His knowledge was also "full":

> "Among internal and external scriptures, there was nothing he did not know."

### The Test: Going to Hostile Territory

The Buddha asked Pūrṇa about returning to his native land. That land was violent:

> "The Buddha said: 'That country is vile and evil; what will you do?'"

Pūrṇa answered with an escalation:

> "'I will cultivate patience. If they insult me, I count myself lucky they did not strike me with fists. If they strike me with fists, I count myself lucky they did not use wooden staffs. If they use wooden staffs, I count myself lucky they did not use knives. If they use knives, I count myself lucky that I will be separated from this poisonous vessel of the Five Aggregates.'"

That's patience. That's full wish *for others* at any cost.

*Ekottara*:

> "In skillfully expounding and analyzing principles, Pūrṇa is foremost."

The *Lotus Sutra* calls him: "**Among those who preach the Dharma, he is foremost.**"

### The Four Teachings

| Teaching | Interpretation of "Full" |
|----------|--------------------------|
| Tripiṭaka | Diligently analyzing dharmas; what was to be done is done — Tripiṭaka Wish Fulfillment |
| Shared | Embodying emptiness; attaining realization in empty dharmas — Shared Wish Fulfillment |
| Distinct | The Dharma Eye is complete — Distinct Wish Fulfillment |
| Perfect | Abiding in the Secret Store — Perfect Wish Fulfillment |

### Fundamental and Trace

> "His fundamental wish was fulfilled long ago; his trace is 'Foremost in Preaching Dharma,' demonstrating a Good Friend to sentient beings."

Pūrṇa's fundamental is a bodhisattva who completed his realization eons ago. The trace-form is simply a teacher who goes where others won't go.

### Contemplating the Mind

> "This is the contemplation of a good friend such as 'the person who practices the principle,' as discussed in the *Mohe Zhiguan*."

When you contemplate a truly reliable teacher — that's Pūrṇa-mind.

## Subhūti (須菩提): Empty Born — First to See the Dharma-Body

### The Name

> "Subhūti (須菩提): Translated as 'Empty Born.' When he was born, the storehouses, baskets, and vessels in his home were all empty. They asked a diviner; the diviner said it was auspicious. Because he was born due to emptiness, he was named 'Empty Born.'"

> "Because he constantly cultivated the practice of emptiness, he is called 'Good Practice.' Because those who make offerings obtain immediate recompense, he is called 'Good Auspiciousness.'"

### The Practice

> "He constantly delighted in roaming in secluded forests and stone caves. The practices he cultivated took emptiness as their root. He constantly entered emptiness samādhi and abode in the **Samādhi of No-Dispute** (*Araṇa*)."

The Samādhi of No-Dispute: harmony without argument. Non-resistance that doesn't yield. Subhūti never fought because there was nothing to fight about.

> "He delighted in preaching the Dharma of emptiness; whatever he proclaimed, all was discriminating emptiness. Wishing to protect sentient beings and not allow obstructions: if they disliked his walking, he would stop; if they disliked his stopping, he would walk."

No friction. Everywhere he went, the conflict dissolved — not by conquest, but by yielding.

### The Dharma-Body Story

When the Buddha descended from Trāyastriṃśa Heaven, everyone rushed to bow. But Subhūti:

> "Sat upright in his stone chamber, contemplating the emptiness of all dharmas: 'Form is not the Buddha — up to and including consciousness is not the Buddha. The eye is not the Buddha — up to and including the mind is not the Buddha.' Suddenly he awakened to the Way."

The Buddha told Bhikṣuṇī Utpalavarṇā (who had arrived first physically):

> "It was not you who bowed first. You bowed to the form-body. Subhūti first saw the Dharma-body."

To see the form is second. To see emptiness is first.

### The Four Teachings

> "There is 'Emptiness-wisdom born from extinguishing form' (Tripiṭaka); 'Emptiness-wisdom born from embodying form' (Shared); 'from being-wisdom is born emptiness-wisdom'; 'from emptiness-wisdom is born conventional wisdom'; and 'from conventional wisdom is born middle wisdom.' 'Empty-born' is precisely being-wisdom: this is Perfect-Teaching emptiness-wisdom-born."

The Four Teachings layer upward. Subhūti occupies the highest layer — where emptiness births everything.

### Fundamental and Trace

> "He abides in the Reality Mark Dharma Body; his trace demonstrates 'Being Born from Seeing Emptiness.'"

### Contemplating the Mind

> "It is not within, not without, and not in-between; it is not self-possessed. This is called the Contemplating-the-Mind Dharma-body."

The Dharma-body isn't located anywhere. Subhūti's cave wasn't where the Dharma-body is — the Dharma-body is where the mind contemplates nothing.

**The Contrast**:

| Pūrṇa | Subhūti |
|-------|---------|
| Goes into danger | Stays in the cave |
| Preaches everywhere | Preaches emptiness |
| Willingly beaten | Never disputed |
| Full wish | Empty birth |

Both foremost. Both essential. The one who speaks endlessly and the one who says nothing — both voices of the same Dharma.
