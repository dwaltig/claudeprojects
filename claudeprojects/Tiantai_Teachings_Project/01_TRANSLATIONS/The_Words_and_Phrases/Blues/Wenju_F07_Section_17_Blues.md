### The Setup

Now listen.

This is a seam-control block.

It performs a precise four-part handoff:

- closes Fascicle Seven Upper
- reopens Fascicle Seven Lower
- reasserts Tiantai attribution line
- marks entry to 化城喻品

---

### Why Seam Work Is Doctrinal Work

If roll boundaries blur, chapter logic drifts.

This seam prevents that by making the transition explicit, auditable, and restart-safe.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B17 seam witness continuity:

- `[2] 不分卷【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 17 is the mechanical bridge from Part1 into Part2.

Without it, downstream 化城 analysis risks inheriting unstable boundary assumptions.
