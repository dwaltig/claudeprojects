### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi now handles the "three sevens" line.

If read flatly, it sounds like Buddha needed time to figure things out.

Zhiyi says no: Buddha in dharmakāya-ground is always illuminating. "Three sevens" is symbolic teaching architecture, not cognitive delay.

---

### The Four Sites and the Stability Pattern

He first names four sites associated with Buddha activity:

- first turning of the wheel
- Bodhi-tree site
- first descent from Trāyastriṃśa
- great miracle site

Then he marks fixed vs not-fixed patterning among them.

Meaning: Buddha activity has stable structural anchors, but not every location is rigidly identical across all contexts.

---

### Older Readings and Yao's Deep-Matter Framing

Zhiyi records older lines about what "three sevens" means.

Yao's reading:

- first seven: contemplate subtle Buddha wisdom
- second seven: contemplate differing capacities of beings
- third seven: contemplate many medicines of Dharma

This keeps solemn depth: even the highest sage moves with deliberative care when stakes are great.

---

### Zhiyi's Reframing: Symbolic Marker of Three Cycles

Zhiyi then gives his key correction:

Buddha does not start knowing only after arriving at the seat. So why "three sevens"?

Because it marks initial intention to teach through **three cycles**:

1. Dharma exposition
2. parable exposition
3. causation exposition

In each cycle, receiving-capacity was not yet ready, so direct Great-mode rollout could not land; therefore Great is paused and smaller-entry teaching is deployed.

---

### Two Doctrinal Lenses for the Same Move

He gives both a focused and a broader lens:

Focused Perfect-Teaching lens:

- three-cycle intent from the standpoint of full round Great-Vehicle disclosure

Broader Great-Vehicle lens:

- first contemplate preaching Perfect Teaching
- then Distinct Teaching
- then Shared-Teaching Great-Vehicle mode
- still no capacity-fit, so Tripiṭaka three-vehicle expedient teaching is applied

Different framing, same compassionate conclusion: sequence follows capacity.

---

### Contemplation-of-Mind Version

Zhiyi also mirrors this inwardly:

- first attempt Middle-Way contemplation (too subtle to sustain)
- then attempt provisionality-as-such contemplation (discriminating wisdom not stabilized)
- then attempt emptiness-as-such contemplation (skillful crossing still not stabilized)
- thus adopt expedient analytic small contemplation as workable entry

So macro teaching history and micro contemplative process follow the same law: fit the medicine to the present stability level.

### Why This Section Matters

This section keeps us from two mistakes:

- imagining Buddha as uncertain
- imagining pedagogical staging as compromise

Zhiyi gives a third way: complete insight with compassionate sequencing.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 三七日 | Three sevens of days | Three-bar setup phrase | Symbolic marker of three-cycle teaching architecture |
| 三周說法 | Three cycles of preaching | Three-pass release structure | Dharma / parable / causation sequence |
| 息大施小 | Pause the Great, apply the Small | Hold the master cut, feed a bridge mix | Capacity-sensitive staging rule |
| 圓教 / 別教 / 通教 | Perfect / Distinct / Shared teachings | Full-spectrum / tiered / common-line modes | Alternative doctrinal lenses for rollout sequence |
| 觀心釋 | Contemplation-of-mind interpretation | Inner mixboard reading | Maps outward teaching sequence onto inward practice process |
| 法身常照 | Dharmakāya constantly illuminates | Ever-on master light | Prevents "Buddha needed time to know" misread |

---

### The Lesson

"Three sevens" is Zhiyi's way of saying: the line was always known, but release must be staged. Buddha keeps the One intact while opening three cycles of entry so beings are not broken by what they cannot yet carry.

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Four-site framework preserved.
- [x] Yao interpretation preserved before Zhiyi's correction.
- [x] Symbolic "three sevens = three cycles" thesis preserved.
- [x] Both doctrinal lenses retained (Perfect-focused and broad Great-Vehicle sequence).
- [x] Contemplation-of-mind parallel retained.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
