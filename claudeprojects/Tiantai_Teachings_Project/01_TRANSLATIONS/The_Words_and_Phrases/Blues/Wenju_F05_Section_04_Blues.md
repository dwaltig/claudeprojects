### The Setup

Now listen.

After the three-cycle symbolic map, Zhiyi sharpens the reason Great-mode speech is still withheld.

He names this section plainly: **no capacity for the Great**.

This is not rhetorical pessimism. It is diagnostic compassion.

---

### The Three-Part No-Capacity Diagnosis

Zhiyi divides the unit into three moments:

1. heavy obstruction burden
2. inability to bear hearing
3. even though Brahmā-kings request teaching, Buddha knows no workable capacity and does not speak the Great directly

So refusal-to-force is not indifference. It is non-harm discipline.

---

### "Dull Faculties" Here Means Structural Mismatch

When Zhiyi says beings' faculties are dull, he is not making a contempt claim.

He is naming a structural mismatch between:

- message intensity (Great-Vehicle direct cut)
- receiver readiness (current karmic/cognitive stability)

If mismatch is too high, hearing becomes injury rather than liberation.

---

### Why Brahmā's Request Does Not Override Capacity Law

Important point:

Even a high cosmic request does not cancel pedagogical fit.

Buddha does not teach by prestige pressure. Buddha teaches by liberative efficacy.

So when capacity is absent, delaying Great-direct speech is itself compassion.

---

### The Hidden Protection Logic

Zhiyi's line implies a hard safeguard:

To force profound teaching into unready channels can deepen confusion, slander, or rejection.

Therefore "not speaking yet" can be a protection act for:

- the listener
- the assembly
- the integrity of the Dharma-line

---

### Bridge to the Next Movement

This section naturally hands off to the next unit:

- if no-capacity + forced speech causes harm
- then ceasing direct mode is necessary
- then expedient mode becomes the compassionate next move

So Section 4 is the diagnostic hinge between symbolic planning (Section 3) and concrete mode-switching (Section 5 onward).

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 無機 | No capacity | No receiving channel open | Core diagnostic claim for withholding direct Great-mode speech |
| 根鈍 | Dull faculties | Slow-open ears under load | Names readiness limitation, not moral condemnation |
| 不堪聞 | Cannot bear hearing | Signal too hot for current circuitry | Protects against harmful overexposure to profound teaching |
| 梵王請說 | Brahmā-kings request teaching | High-house request for the drop | Tests whether status-pressure can override fit (it cannot) |
| 知無機故不說 | Knowing no capacity, therefore not speaking | Compassionate hold decision | Non-harm pedagogical restraint principle |
| 障重 | Heavy obstruction | Thick static wall | Immediate reason direct-full transmission is delayed |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi teaches that compassion is not measured by how quickly you say the highest thing. It is measured by whether what you say can actually liberate. When capacity is absent, restraint is mercy.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Three-part no-capacity structure preserved (obstruction / unbearable hearing / Brahmā request declined).
- [x] "Dull faculties" rendered as readiness mismatch, not disdain.
- [x] Non-forcing principle preserved as protective compassion.
- [x] Brahmā-request episode retained as fit-test case.
- [x] Handoff logic into ceasing/expedient section preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
