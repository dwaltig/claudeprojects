### The Setup

Now listen.

Section 8 declared the Four Ones.

Section 9 asks a precise follow-up:

If earlier systems already mapped path and attainment, what exactly is still doubtful for bodhisattvas?

Zhiyi answers by showing the fault-line between prior doctrinal map and present Lotus re-clarification.

---

### The Question

"What doubt do bodhisattvas have?"

Not beginner doubt. Advanced-system doubt.

They are questioning alignment across frameworks.

---

### The Tension Zhiyi Names

He contrasts two prior explanatory lines:

- Tripiṭaka-style long-course framing (three asaṃkhyeya scale with staged delusion-cutting)
- Shared-Teaching framing (cut principal afflictions, residual habits remain, Buddhahood after habit exhaustion)

Then the Lotus brief explanation labels prior framing as expedient.

So the pressure point becomes:

Where are "former true" and "former attainment" now located?

---

### The Secondary Doubt: If One Path Is Studied Together, Why Distinctions?

If the Three Vehicles all study one path-line, why do distinctions persist?

This is not rejection of One Vehicle. It is a coherence challenge:

How do differentiated pedagogies and one final line coexist without contradiction?

---

### Zhiyi's Resolution Gesture

The section closes with a sweeping claim:

Hearing Lotus, doubts are swept out with not even a speck remaining.

Meaning:

Lotus does not erase prior teachings as pointless. It reorders them as expedient phases within a clarified whole.

That is how distinction and non-duality are both preserved.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 11 prevents two extremes:

- dismissing prior teachings as false trash
- freezing prior teachings as final and refusing Lotus re-clarification

Zhiyi's move is integrative and hierarchical: provisional is real as method, real is final as disclosure.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 菩薩何疑 | What do bodhisattvas doubt? | Where does the advanced map still snag? | Frames high-level coherence inquiry, not basic skepticism |
| 三僧祇 | Three asaṃkhyeya kalpas | Long-haul timeline frame | Marks earlier large-scale cultivation schema |
| 斷正留習 | Cut primary, retain residual habits | Main knot cut, background groove remains | Shared-Teaching developmental account |
| 方便 | Expedient | Training mode for current capacity | Reclassifies prior formulations without negating their function |
| 一道有別 | One path yet distinctions | Same destination, different channel configs | Core reconciliation problem in the section |
| 掃蕩諸疑 | Sweep away all doubts | Clear the board to the grain | Lotus resolution claim after doctrinal tension is surfaced |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi lets the hard doctrinal question stand, then resolves it without denial: prior models were workable medicine, not final endpoint. Lotus does not break them; it places them and clears the residue.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Bodhisattva-doubt question preserved as substantive doctrinal inquiry.
- [x] Tripiṭaka/Shared-Teaching contrast preserved.
