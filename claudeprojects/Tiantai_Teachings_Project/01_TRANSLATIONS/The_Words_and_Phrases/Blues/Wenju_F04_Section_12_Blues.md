### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi has already said why the provisional had to be spoken under heavy obstruction.

Now he does the technical work: he names the Five Corruptions with precision, then shows how they stack, intensify, and flood an era.

This is not mood language. It is a field diagnosis.

---

### The Four Distinctions Before the Details

Zhiyi says the Five Corruptions are handled through four distinctions:

1. number stated
2. names listed
3. substance-and-marks clarified
4. conclusion and interpretive tie-off

The first two are straightforward. The real doctrinal labor is in substance and marks.

---

### Which Corruptions Have a Separate Substance and Which Do Not

He makes an important split.

Two do **not** have an independent substance in themselves:

- **kalpa corruption** (time-frame designation)
- **sentient-being corruption** (provisional label built on view/pride plus karmic-retribution structure)

Three are assigned direct operative bases:

- afflictions corruption -> five dull drivers
- views corruption -> five sharp drivers
- lifespan corruption -> the linking-and-holding continuity of form-and-mind

So the five are not all the same type of claim. Some are derivative designations; some are active engine-clusters.

---

### The Marks: How a Corrupt Age Sounds and Feels

Zhiyi then paints the marks in escalating sequence:

- anger surges -> weapons disaster
- greed surges -> famine disaster
- ignorance surges -> pestilence disaster

When these rise together, affliction density increases, wrong views blaze, names turn foul, embodied life coarsens, and lifespan shrinks.

He uses forceful images:

- fish and dragons thrashing in storm-water
- no interval of rest
- turbulence without stable footing

This is a social, karmic, cognitive, and existential weather report all at once.

---

### The Long Simile Chain

He expands each corruption with concrete analogies:

- world-cycle decline and conflict as kalpa-corruption markers
- greed like a sea never filled
- anger like a venom-serpent attacking worlds
- ignorance darker than lacquer and ink
- pride looking down without limit
- doubt as netting that blocks truth-entry

For beings-corruption, the "false controller" language matters: grasping form-and-mind as a sovereign self becomes sticky like glue, producing repeated birth-drift through six destinies.

For lifespan-corruption, he stresses fragility: morning birth / evening death, breath-like impermanence.

This is not poetic excess. It is map detail for practice realism.

---

### Sequence Logic: Why These Five Are Ordered This Way

Zhiyi gives a root-chain:

- afflictions and views are root
- from those two, "sentient beings" configuration forms
- from that, lifespan continuity is held
- those four passing through time are called kalpa-corruption

So kalpa-corruption is not merely chronological background. It is fourfold corruption accumulated across duration.

---

### Why This Section Matters

If we skip this section, we romanticize expedients.

Zhiyi is showing that compassionate pedagogy is not delivered into neutral air. It is delivered into dense obstruction-fields.

The Five Corruptions are the acoustic conditions that explain why Dharma release must be adapted without surrendering the One Vehicle.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 五濁 | Five corruptions | Five-layer static field | Obstruction matrix explaining expedient deployment |
| 體相 | Substance and marks | Engine plus signal trace | Distinguishes essence-claim from lived symptom |
| 五鈍使 | Five dull drivers | Heavy-grip habit motors | Substance-base of afflictions corruption |
| 五利使 | Five sharp drivers | Fast-cut wrong-seeing blades | Substance-base of views corruption |
| 連持色心 | Linking and holding form-mind | Hold-chain of embodied continuity | Substance-base of lifespan corruption |
| 眾濁交湊 | Corruptions converging | All-channel distortion at once | Intensification image for a degenerate era |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi does not treat "degenerate age" as slogan. He anatomizes it. Once the anatomy is clear, expedient speech no longer looks like compromise. It looks like calibrated compassion in a storm.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Four-distinction framework preserved (number/name/substance-marks/conclusion).
- [x] Non-separate-substance logic retained for kalpa and beings corruptions.
- [x] Five dull/sharp driver assignments preserved.
- [x] Disaster triad linkage retained (anger-weapons, greed-famine, ignorance-pestilence).
- [x] Sequence chain preserved (affliction/view -> beings -> lifespan -> kalpa-through-time).
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
