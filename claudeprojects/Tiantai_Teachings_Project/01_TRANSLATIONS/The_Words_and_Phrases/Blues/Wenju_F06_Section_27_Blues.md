### The Setup

Now listen.

A hard question appears:

if dharmakāya-trained bodhisattvas are abundant and capable,
why this anxiety about lineage continuation?

Zhiyi answers by distinguishing domains.

---

### Two Kinds of Retinue

He says this block is about transformation-body retinue dynamics, where succession concerns are real in appearance-process.

Dharmakāya-level non-arising/non-ceasing logic is not the immediate frame here.

So "old-age lament" belongs to this pedagogical domain.

---

### Son as Carrier of Household

"Child" is the one who can inherit and continue the teaching-household in this visible line.

When such a capacity appears, joy returns: now wealth can be entrusted.

This closes the first large father-son-loss cycle.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 27 resolves the emotional-theological tension and seals the first parable movement before the fascicle seam.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves:

- `[1] 來【大】，解【甲】`
- `[2] 不分卷【甲】`

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 法身所化 | Dharmakāya-transformed retinue | Ultimate-line disciples | Distinguished from current pedagogical frame |
| 化身眷屬 | Transformation-body retinue | Manifest teaching-line heirs | Immediate frame for succession concern |
| 子繼父業 | Child continues father's work | Dharma household transmission | Core entrustment motif |
| 付法財 | Entrust dharma wealth | Hand over the lineage assets | Completion move of this cycle |
| 佛種相續 | Buddha-seed continuity | Line not cut off | Transmission objective |
| 領總譬竟 | General parable receiving complete | First-cycle closure marker | Formal end of this arc |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi answers the metaphysical objection by respecting pedagogical level: different frames, different concerns, one compassionate aim.
