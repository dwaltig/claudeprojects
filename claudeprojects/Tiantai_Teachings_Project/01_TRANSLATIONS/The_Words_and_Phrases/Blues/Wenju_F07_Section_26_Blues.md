### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi runs another dual Q/A to stress-test naming and method:

- does this naming create loss of proper doctrinal sign?
- does it induce frightened entry or confused reception?
- can provisional-city speech still count as non-false guidance?

He resolves the set without surrendering either compassion or truth.

---

### Resolution Pattern

The logic is consistent:

- apparent risk is acknowledged
- the pedagogical function is clarified
- non-false status is preserved by endpoint integrity

If the method truly leads onward to treasure, it is not deception.
It is calibrated rescue.

### Witness Discipline

This F07-B26 block is mapped as a dual Q/A sequence with no additional apparatus bundle in scope.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 26 is a hermeneutic shield.

It guards the guide-city strategy from charges of doctrinal compromise.
