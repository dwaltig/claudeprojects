### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi presents the proper bond-formation sequence in three phases:

- awareness of Buddha's shift/withdrawal moment
- renewed teaching continuation by capable heirs
- eventual reception and awakening unfolding even after delay

This is causal relay, not interruption.

---

### Three-Part Bond Logic

The section refuses instant-only models.

It preserves:

- immediate hearers
- deferred hearers
- post-event hearers who still come to fruition

So "bond formation" includes temporal dispersion while keeping one line of truth-work.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B22 apparatus continuity:

- `[7] 又【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[8] 一【大】，二【甲】`
- `[9] 諸【大】，〔－〕【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 22 is crucial for historical continuity doctrine.

It explains how the Dharma remains live across changing presenters, delayed reception, and different maturity windows.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 正結緣 | Properly forming karmic bonds | Authentic line-linking | Marks valid transmission continuity |
| 三分 | Three-part structure | Triple relay frame | Organizes the bond process stages |
| 知佛入室 | Knowing Buddha entered withdrawal | Transition-awareness moment | Triggers successor responsibility |
| 覆講轉續 | Re-teaching continuation | Relay teaching handoff | Keeps Dharma line active beyond single event |
| 方始受大 | Only then receiving the Great | Delayed major-vehicle uptake | Honors staggered maturation |
| 滅後得道 | Attaining the path after passing | Post-event awakening fruition | Extends efficacy beyond immediate historical scene |

---

### The Lesson

The line can pass through delay and still ripen true.
Bond-work is patient, not panic.
