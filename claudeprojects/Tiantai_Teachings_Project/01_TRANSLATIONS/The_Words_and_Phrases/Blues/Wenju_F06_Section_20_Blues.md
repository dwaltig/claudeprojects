### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi announces the expanded receiving-understanding parable architecture:

five major parable movements.

He also gives a major hermeneutic ruling about the elder figure.

---

### Five-Parable Map

He lays out:

1. father-son loss
2. father-son meeting
3. pursuit and inducement
4. entrusted-household maturation
5. transfer of household authority

He also notes a combined-reading possibility for latter units.

---

### She-Narrative Principle

Zhiyi rejects importing distant separate-buddha identification into this frame.

His ruling:

hidden and manifest forms are different displays of one body,
not body-swapping identities.

This guards continuity of the parable's doctrinal force.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 20 establishes both architecture and identity logic.

Without this, later father/son symbolism fractures.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves the B20 apparatus chain:

`[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [＊5-1] [6] [＊6-1] [7] [A3]`

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 廣領解 | Broad receiving-understanding | Full testimony expansion | Opens large parable explanatory field |
| 譬為五 | Five-parable structure | Five-track narrative engine | Primary architecture map |
| 舍那隱顯一體 | She-na hidden/manifest one body | One source, two display modes | Identity continuity rule |
| 著垢衣 / 脫纓珞 | Wear coarse robe / remove ornaments | Conceal glory for rescue | Expedient manifestation principle |
| 何甞變換 | Never actually changed body | No entity swap | Protects doctrinal continuity |
| 附文立義 | Ground meaning in textual fit | No free projection method | Hermeneutic discipline statement |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi insists on one body, many compassionate displays. That keeps the parable true and workable.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] B20 five-parable architecture preserved.
- [x] Hidden/manifest one-body ruling preserved.
- [x] Anti-import-of-unfitting-identity argument preserved.
- [x] Full witness bundle `[1]/[2]/[3]/[4]/[5]/[＊5-1]/[6]/[＊6-1]/[7]/[A3]` preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
