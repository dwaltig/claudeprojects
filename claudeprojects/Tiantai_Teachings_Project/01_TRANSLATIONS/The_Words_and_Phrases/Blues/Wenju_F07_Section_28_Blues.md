### The Setup

Now listen.

The guide now actively manages the group in difficulty.

This segment expands the operational sequence:

- detect fear and depletion
- deploy confidence-restoring strategy
- hold route coherence
- keep eventual treasure destination explicit

---

### Long-Form Guidance Logic

This is path governance, not motivational speech.

The leader must balance:

- immediate psychological stabilization
- long-range doctrinal direction

If either side is dropped, the group either collapses now or stalls later.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B28 apparatus continuity:

- `[1] 時【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[2] 二【大】，三【甲】`
- `[3] 子【大】，〔－〕【甲】`

### Why This Section Matters

Section 28 models skillful leadership under stress.

It explains how provisional structures are introduced without losing final-orientation truth.
