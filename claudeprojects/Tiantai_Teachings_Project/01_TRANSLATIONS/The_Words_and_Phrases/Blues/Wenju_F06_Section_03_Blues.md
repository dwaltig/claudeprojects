### The Setup

Now listen.

After the five-dull cluster, Zhiyi opens the five-sharp cluster and drives the fire image vertically through desire, form, and formless domains.

This is where the parable becomes a full psychocosmic model.

---

### Five-Sharp as Ghost-Field Hermeneutics

He says sharp afflictions are represented by ghost/demonic types because they carry tactical intelligence.

The sequence tracks:

1. wrong view (邪見)
2. precept-grasp (戒取)
3. self-view (身見)
4. view-grasp (見取)
5. edge views (邊見)

Each is decoded through behavior, speech, and doctrinal error-pattern.

---

### Wrong View as Causal Denial

In this block, wrong view is not vague confusion.

It is active denial of causal order, good/evil fruition, and liberative consequence.

Zhiyi repeatedly marks the external preaching effect:

inner fixation becomes outer doctrine that drags hearers downward.

---

### Precept-Grasp and Meditative Misread

He then shows how disciplined practice can still derail when grasping hardens:

- partial calm mistaken for completion
- suppression mistaken for liberation
- technique mistaken for truth

The imagery of restraining dogs and applying force is read as method-layers in contemplative correction.

---

### From Desire Fire to Form and Formless Fire

Zhiyi escalates the burn map:

- desire realm: coarse affliction blaze
- form realm: subtler heat and conflict in meditative states
- formless realm: even at the summit, suffering-fire remains unextinguished

So no layer of samsaric refinement is final release.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 03 blocks spiritual complacency.

Even high states can still burn when wrong view survives.

---

### Witness Cluster Discipline

B03 carries a large apparatus bundle and must remain locked:

`[17] [18] [＊15-2] [＊15-3] [＊15-4] [19] [20] [＊20-1] [21] [＊15-5] [22] [＊22-1] [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [＊15-6] [1]`

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 五利使 | Five sharp afflictions | Quick-cut delusion engines | Second affliction field after five-dull cluster |
| 邪見 | Wrong view | Causal-denial mind | Rejects karmic and liberative truth structures |
| 戒取 | Precept-grasp | Method fixation trap | Clings to form without liberative penetration |
| 邊見 | Edge views (eternalism/annihilationism) | Two-horn split | Polarized metaphysical error from self-view |
| 色界 / 無色界火起 | Fire rising in form/formless realms | Subtle burn layers | Shows refined states still within samsaric heat |
| 其宅如是眾難非一 | This house has many hazards | Full hazard field statement | Summative closure of the general parable's burn map |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi's warning is surgical: climbing higher inside the burning house is still inside the burning house.

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Five-sharp sequence preserved in order.
- [x] Wrong-view and preaching-effect logic preserved.
- [x] Meditative-misread caution in precept-grasp section preserved.
- [x] Desire/form/formless fire escalation preserved.
- [x] General-parable closure line function preserved.
- [x] B03 witness cluster preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
