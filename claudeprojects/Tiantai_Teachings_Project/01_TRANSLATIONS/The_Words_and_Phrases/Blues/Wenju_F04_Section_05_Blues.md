### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi moves from "who awakens" and "who gets prediction" into a timing-and-depth board:

1. Is awakening shallow or deep?
2. Do provisional and real lines receive different benefit?
3. Must everyone wait for the same teaching moment?

This section is about sequence without fatalism.

### Meaning 8: Awakening Has Depth Gradients

Zhiyi says there is a general statement and a finer one.

General statement: all three groups can be said to break ignorance and enter first-abode realization.

Finer reading: depth still differentiates.

- Hearing Dharma exposition gives entry.
- Hearing parable exposition can clarify it again and deepen it.
- Hearing causes-and-conditions exposition can advance it further.
- Hearing the *Life-span* chapter deepens still more.

So awakening is not one static checkbox. It can be cumulative in brightness.

He compares it to repeated hearing: hearing again can surpass what was previously heard.

### Meaning 9: Benefit Is Not "Real-Only"

A narrow view says: real-practice lines get benefit; provisional lines only assist others.

Zhiyi rejects that.

At mature disclosure (especially in life-span horizon), both provisional and real lines receive benefit.

- Path increase rises.
- Birth-burden decreases.
- Ultimate proximity intensifies.

He insists that "benefiting others" and "benefiting self" are not strictly separate silos here. If provisional action matures others and conversion merit returns, provisional lines are not benefit-empty.

One-voice preaching with many kinds obtaining understanding makes this explicit.

---

### Meaning 10: Waiting for Time, Not Waiting for Time

Now he gives timing doctrine.

**Waiting for time**: those who did not awaken in prior stages and require Lotus convergence.

**Not waiting for time**: those who had already entered through earlier, hidden/secret openings.

Zhiyi frames this through explicit vs secret exposition:

- In explicit sequence, many require flavor-by-flavor maturation into Lotus resolution.
- In secret sequence, some had already entered before public Lotus disclosure.

Same applies inside three cycles and trace/origin gates: awakening may appear earlier or later depending on conditions and mode of disclosure.

---

### Q/A: Is There Ever Truly "Lost Time"?

Question: what about capacities not gathered by either explicit or secret timing in this life? Is that permanent miss?

Zhiyi says no, at least in Lotus scope.

Not awakened here does not mean permanently excluded. Hearing can occur in another-land context; timing may be deferred, not annihilated.

So "lost time" becomes "waiting for that land's time."

Even the five-thousand who rose and left are not sealed off forever; they can still receive benefit through later propagation streams.

This is stern teaching with long mercy.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 悟有淺深 | Awakening has shallow/deep | First hit vs deeper replay | Tracks cumulative depth of realization |
| 權實得益 | Provisional/real benefit | Both lines getting paid in Dharma terms | Rejects real-only benefit framing |
| 待時/不待時 | Waiting for time / not waiting | Release-day listeners and advance listeners | Timing doctrine across explicit/secret disclosure |
| 顯說/密教 | Explicit preaching / secret teaching | Public drop and hidden feed | Two modes of teaching-time operation |
| 失時 | Lost time | Missed this release window | Reframed as deferred, not final exclusion |
| 彼土之時 | Time of that land | Next venue's listening hour | Cross-land continuation of awakening conditions |

### The Lesson

Zhiyi refuses despair reading. Some hear early, some hear late, some deepen by repeated hearing, some enter through secret routes before public naming. But Lotus does not reduce timing delay to permanent loss. In this frame, deferred hearing is still hearing, and path-depth can keep unfolding past first entry.

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Meanings 8-10 preserved as distinct but linked movement (depth, benefit, timing).
- [x] Explicit/secret timing distinction retained.
- [x] Lost-time Q/A preserved with "deferred not annihilated" logic.
- [x] Five-thousand implication retained as later-benefit possibility.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
- [x] No doctrinal flattening (sequence preserved; non-fatal timing maintained).
