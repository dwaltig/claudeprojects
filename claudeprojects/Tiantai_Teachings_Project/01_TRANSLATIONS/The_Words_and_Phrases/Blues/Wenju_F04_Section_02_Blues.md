### The Setup

Now listen.

After rejecting one-sided arguments about voice-hearer presence and absence, Zhiyi keeps tightening the board. Next he asks two linked questions:

1. Is confusion thick or thin?
2. Do roots turn, or not turn?

This is where he corrects older interpreters who treated awakening speed like a fixed caste mark.

### Meaning 3: Thick and Thin Is Not a Slogan

An older explanation says people hesitate between one principle and three teachings, and that this hesitation maps cleanly to superior, middle, and lower roots.

Zhiyi says the model does not hold.

He presses hard:

- If they are still wavering inside small-vehicle framework, their fetter-cutting claim is unstable.
- If they are wavering between great and small as if both are still mixed, that misses the Great Vehicle's distinct line.
- If prior doubt and attachment were already active before this teaching moment, then hearing "open three, reveal one" should have resolved it immediately, not produced fresh shock.

His verdict: no stable basis for that old explanation.

---

### The Four-Phrase Operational Model

Zhiyi then gives a cleaner framework:

1. Light confusion, sharp root.
2. Heavy confusion, sharp root.
3. Light confusion, dull root.
4. Heavy confusion, dull root.

Outcomes:

- Phrase 1: first hearing, awakening.
- Phrase 2: second hearing, understanding.
- Phrase 3: third hearing, decision.
- Phrase 4: even after three hearings, no awakening yet; only karmic tie-making.

He also allows a grouping move: first two as superior-root band; middle pair as middle/lower band depending on context.

This is not sentimental. It is diagnostic staging.

### Meaning 4: Turning Roots Without Erasing Difference

Older claim: lower turns to middle, middle turns to upper, and by later rounds everybody effectively becomes upper.

Zhiyi rejects that as incoherent.

If all have turned into the same root-status, why still call anyone dull and say they must wait for later rounds?

He gives a sharper account:

Mind is not fixed.

- Bad conditions can turn sharp toward dull.
- Good conditions can turn dull toward sharp.

So yes, turning happens, but not as a simplistic one-way promotion ladder.

Some transform fast and awaken in first-round Dharma exposition.  
Some turn enough to awaken with parable exposition.  
Some do not turn and need all three rounds.

Then the famous image:

Three knives cutting one block of wood:

- sharp knife: one stroke
- middle knife: two strokes
- dull knife: three strokes

Different speed names remain true. The place of cutting through is still one.

### Q/A: Once in First Abode, Is There Still Better/Worse?

Question: once all three roots enter first abode, is there still sharp/dull?

Answer: when true cultivation-body is manifest, no rank gap remains.

Question: above first abode, when contingent cultivation continues, is there superiority/inferiority?

Answer: in the same level, no win/loss remains; once true-cultivation substance is fused, difference-talk collapses.

This is important: distinctions guide entry; they do not define ultimate status.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 惑有厚薄 | Confusion thick/thin | Fog weight on the ear | Diagnostic weight of obscuration |
| 根轉不轉 | Root turns/does not turn | Ear shift or no shift | Capacity change under conditions |
| 四句 | Four phrases | Four-lane diagnostic board | Operational classification of hearing outcomes |
| 結緣眾 | Assembly forming ties | Tie-making crowd | Not yet awakened, still karmically linked |
| 真修體顯 | True-cultivation body manifest | The real groove shows itself | No gradation at realized level |
| 三刀斫木 | Three knives cutting wood | Three-cut test | Preserves speed difference without doctrinal split |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi refuses both fatalism and flattening. He will not let "sharp" and "dull" become permanent labels, and he will not let "turning" erase real differences in process. Conditions matter, sequence matters, and hearing-depth matters. But the cut-through point remains one. Different stroke counts, one severed block. That is the discipline of this section.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Core rejection preserved (old thick/thin model denied with reasons).
- [x] Four-phrase framework preserved with staged outcomes.
- [x] Turning-roots rebuttal preserved without collapsing distinctions.
- [x] Two Q/A exchanges preserved (first-abode and above-first-abode).
- [x] Three-knife metaphor retained as the section's decisive image.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
