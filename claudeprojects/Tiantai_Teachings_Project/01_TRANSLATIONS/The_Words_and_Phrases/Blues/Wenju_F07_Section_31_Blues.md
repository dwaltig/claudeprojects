### The Setup

Now listen.

A classic question set is revisited:

- what is the status of vehicle and city imagery?
- how should movement and stillness be interpreted?

Zhiyi answers by refusing hard splits.

---

### Dialectic Resolution

The teaching does not force one pole:

- stillness has function in rest and orientation
- movement has function in onward realization

City and vehicle language are coordinated means,
not rival absolutes.

---

### Witness Discipline

This F07-B31 block is mapped as an old Q/A dialectic segment with no additional apparatus bundle in scope.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 31 protects interpretive balance.

Without it, readers absolutize either stability or motion and mis-handle the parable's layered intent.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 舊問答 | Earlier/old Q&A | Received objection channel | Brings inherited disputes into present clarification |
| 車 / 城 | Vehicle / city | Transport means / protective station | Paired expedient figures under analysis |
| 動 / 靜 | Motion / stillness | Forward push / settling pause | Dialectical pair to be integrated |
| 體用關係 | Substance-function relation | Core and operation linkage | Prevents symbolic fragmentation |
| 兩邊不著 | Not clinging to either side | Anti-extreme method | Keeps middle-way interpretive posture |
| 會歸一旨 | Converging to one intention | Unified telos recovery | Rejoins dialectic to liberation aim |

---

### The Lesson

Rest and movement both serve the road,
when neither is worshiped as final.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)
