### The Setup

Now listen.

This final line closes Fascicle Five Lower:

`妙法蓮華經文句卷第五下`

---

### Why This Final Line Matters

In source-locked production, colophons are operational markers:

- they certify boundary completion
- they prevent spillover into next fascicle content
- they seal transmission units for audit and restart

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 36 gives us a clean endpoint.

No ambiguity about whether F05 drafting is complete.

### The Lesson

A clean ending line is part of truth-care. The roll closes where the source says it closes.

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Final colophon closure preserved one-to-one.
- [x] No spillover content added.
- [x] Fascicle-end boundary integrity preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
