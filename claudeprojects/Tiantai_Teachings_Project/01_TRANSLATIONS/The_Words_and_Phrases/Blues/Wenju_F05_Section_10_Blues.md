### The Setup

Now listen.

After revealing the real, Zhiyi does not soften the stakes.

He praises the Dharma as rare, then explains what "rare" actually means.

Not collector's rarity. Not mystical scarcity performance. Rarity here is a timing-and-reception equation.

---

### Two-Part Structure of the Rarity Unit

Zhiyi divides the block into two movements:

1. one line: wondrous Dharma = provisional and real in functional unity
2. four-and-a-half lines: "only at the right time is it spoken"

So rarity is tied to when disclosure can truly land.

---

### Provisional and Real Are Originally Non-Dual

He states a key corrective:

Provisional and real are originally without fixed discrimination.

Discrimination appears for dull roots and smaller wisdom.

When one reawakens to non-duality of one and three, one knows Buddha's speech of three and one is non-contradictory.

So "wondrous" is non-dual operability, not conceptual confusion.

---

### The Four Difficulties

Zhiyi maps four distinct difficulties:

1. **difficulty of the person**: a Buddha appearing after long spans
2. **difficulty of the Dharma**: even when Buddha appears, real disclosure may still wait
3. **difficulty of hearing**: many can sit in sound-range yet fail to truly hear (five-thousand type warning)
4. **difficulty of trust-acceptance**: among many listeners, very few first fully receive

This is why rarity language is pedagogically sober, not ornamental.

---

### Udumbara as an Interpretive Marker

The udumbara image is used to mark this fourfold difficulty frame.

Zhiyi notes it matches hearing-difficulty most directly, while the other difficulties are inferred by analogy.

So symbol is controlled, not overextended.

---

### Why "All Buddhas Are Like This" Matters

When Zhiyi says "all Buddhas are like this," he removes personality-exception thinking.

This is not Śākyamuni's private style choice. It is Buddha-method law:

- use provisional to lead
- reveal real in season
- measure by liberation outcome

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 10 prevents triumphal misunderstanding after Section 8's real disclosure.

Even with full truth present, the bottleneck remains hearing-plus-trusting capacity.

Rarity teaches humility in reception, not pessimism in doctrine.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 歎法希有 | Praise Dharma as rare | Name the weight before the deep cut | Establishes reception sobriety after real disclosure |
| 權實不二 | Provisional and real non-dual | One line, two delivery modes | Prevents false split between method and truth |
| 時乃說之 | Speak only at the right time | Drop when the room can hold it | Timing doctrine behind rarity language |
| 四難 | Four difficulties | Four choke-points in transmission | Person, Dharma, hearing, and trust/acceptance bottlenecks |
| 曇花譬 | Udumbara simile | Rare-bloom timing marker | Symbol for the difficulty conditions of authentic reception |
| 信受難 | Difficulty of faith-acceptance | Hearing is one thing, taking it in is another | Final and hardest reception gate |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi's rarity teaching says this: truth can be fully present and still rarely received. The hard part is not only proclamation; it is timing, hearing, and trust ripening together.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Two-part rarity structure preserved (wondrous Dharma + right-time speaking).
- [x] Non-dual provisional/real logic preserved.
- [x] Four-difficulty framework preserved explicitly.
- [x] Udumbara function preserved with scope limits.
- [x] "All Buddhas" universality retained as method-law claim.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
