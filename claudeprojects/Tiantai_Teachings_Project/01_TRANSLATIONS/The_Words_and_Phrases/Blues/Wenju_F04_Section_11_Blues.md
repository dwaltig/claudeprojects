### The Setup

Now listen.

Fascicle 4 turns into the lower roll, but Zhiyi keeps the same structural current.

We now enter the detailed Śākyamuni chapter expansion. In the six-meaning board, this lower segment does not re-run "praise rarity" as a separate item; it proceeds with the remaining operational turns:

1. open provisional
2. reveal real
3. raise five corruptions to explain expedient speech
4. reject false and urge trust in one reality
5. no falsehood

This is not missing content. It is distributed sequence.

---

### "I Now Am Also Like This"

Zhiyi reads this as continuity statement:

Śākyamuni in the present follows the same disclosure logic as the Buddhas previously mapped.

First three, then one. Same architecture, current execution.

Then he parses capacity-language temporally:

- past: root
- present: desire
- future: nature

The line about "deeply attached mind" is keyed to root orientation. "Expedients" means fitting three-vehicle provisional speech to present capacities. "All this for one Buddha vehicle" marks the real disclosure line.

So teaching-one, practice-one, and principle-one are reactivated, now in present-Buddha register.

---

### Why the Five Corruptions Enter Here

Zhiyi says: we already saw opening provisional and revealing real. What still needed explicit treatment is this:

Why would a pure one-like-space Dharma ever speak in layered provisional forms?

Answer: because five-corruption obstruction is heavy in lived worlds.

So this segment clarifies "hiding the real to implement the provisional" as compassionate strategy under obstruction pressure.

This is a key doctrinal hinge: expedient layering is not doctrinal compromise; it is adaptive method under field-conditions.

---

### The Functional Reframe

Without this reframe, people misunderstand two ways:

- they think provisional speech means truth is diluted
- they think one-vehicle truth cancels pedagogical staging

Zhiyi blocks both.

One-vehicle intent remains intact, while provisional articulation adjusts to actual obstruction-density.

That is skill, not contradiction.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 廣釋迦章 | Extensive Śākyamuni chapter | Present-Buddha full mix pass | Lower-roll expansion of current-Buddha teaching logic |
| 我今亦如是 | I now am also like this | Same line, this set | Continuity claim across Buddha presentations |
| 隱實施權 | Hide real, apply provisional | Keep the master under cloth while training ears | Adaptive strategy under obstruction conditions |
| 五乘根性欲 | Five-vehicle root-nature desires | Multi-audience listening profile | Capacity mapping for tailored instruction |
| 教一 / 行一 / 理一 | Teaching one / practice one / principle one | One instruction stream / one path line / one root line | Re-activated threefold unity markers in lower-roll frame |
| 五濁障重 | Five-corruption heavy obstruction | Dense static field | Justifies staged expedient deployment |

---

### The Lesson

This opening of the lower roll says the same Dharma-line continues, but conditions now are foregrounded. If we ignore obstruction conditions, expedients look suspicious. If we read with conditions in view, expedients become compassionate precision on the way to one-vehicle disclosure.

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Lower-roll transition preserved without breaking previous architecture.
- [x] Five-turn active sequence preserved (with rarity-turn absence noted correctly).
- [x] Temporal root/desire/nature mapping retained.
- [x] Hidden-real/applied-provisional hinge preserved as strategic logic.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
- [x] No simplification into either pure gradualism or pure immediatism.
