### The Setup

Now listen.

A clean question is raised:

if bodhisattvas also have fruit,
why not explicitly call this "bodhisattva fruit"?

The answer: in this location, whether named path or fruit, both are treated as Buddha-cause orientation.

---

### Terminology Discipline

Zhiyi is not denying fruit.
He is regulating naming function in context:

- language is chosen to prevent premature closure
- "path" keeps forward causal momentum explicit
- "fruit" is not discarded, but subsumed into Buddha-cause trajectory

---

### Witness Discipline

This F07-B14 unit is scoped as a Q/A closure segment with no additional apparatus bundle in block definition.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 14 guards against lexical confusion becoming doctrinal error.

The naming choice keeps practitioners moving toward full completion instead of freezing at a partial designation.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 菩薩果 | Bodhisattva fruit | Bodhisattva completion marker | Term under interpretive review |
| 菩薩道 | Bodhisattva path | Ongoing causal route | Preferred emphasis in this context |
| 佛因 | Buddha cause | Full-awakening seed line | Unifies path/fruit language here |
| 義亦應得 | This meaning is also admissible | Qualified allowance formula | Permits alternative term without losing argument |
| 名義調整 | Terminological adjustment | Context-fit naming discipline | Prevents word-level doctrinal drift |
| 不中途取證 | Do not seize proof mid-way | Anti-stagnation warning | Keeps trajectory open toward unsurpassed realization |

---

### The Lesson

Sometimes the safest word is the one that keeps the road open.
Zhiyi chooses language to protect completion, not ego-certainty.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] F07-B14 Q/A polarity preserved.
- [x] Path/fruit lexical calibration preserved.
- [x] Buddha-cause emphasis preserved.
- [x] No spill into F07-B15 prophecy-opening witness scope.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
