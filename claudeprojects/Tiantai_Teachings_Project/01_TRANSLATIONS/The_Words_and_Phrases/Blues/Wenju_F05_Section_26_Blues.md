### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi addresses a difficult phrase: "the gate that is burned."

If teaching is gate, can teaching itself burn?

He answers with analytic precision.

---

### Gate Has "Frame" and "Opening"

He distinguishes two aspects:

- frame element (件): can decay
- opening element (空): cannot be burned

Then maps this to teaching:

- explanatory speech (能詮) can cease
- what is explained (所詮) is not destroyed in that way

Thus one exits through teaching into what teaching points to.

---

### Two Registers of Exit

Zhiyi gives layered readings:

- from impermanent teaching gate (small-vehicle framing)
- from permanence-through-insight where text itself is liberation-expression (great-vehicle framing)

He keeps expedient and real wisdom both active.

---

### "Play" as Defilement Behavior

He glosses "play" multiple ways:

- clinging to views
- clinging to desire
- intoxication with dusts
- wasting life without renunciation

"Not aware, not knowing, not alarmed, not afraid" becomes a full ignorance profile.

Then he maps each phrase to five turbidities.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 26 turns one image into doctrinal diagnostics:

how language functions, how delusion behaves, and how rescue remains possible.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 所燒之門 | Burned gate | Crisis passageway | Names teaching-use inside danger-field |
| 件 / 空 | Structural frame / open pass | Burnable frame / unburnable opening | Clarifies two-layer gate ontology |
| 能詮 / 所詮 | Explaining / explained | Spoken pointer / realized meaning | Distinguishes language from realized truth |
| 樂著嬉戲 | Delighted attachment play | Delusion play loop | Behavioral map of samsaric fixation |
| 不覺不知不驚不怖 | Not aware, not knowing, not alarmed, not afraid | Total numbness profile | Ignorance-phase progression |
| 五濁相當 | Corresponding to five turbidities | Full-smoke mapping | Links behavior phrases to doctrinal pathology set |

### The Lesson

Zhiyi says the gate is not a slogan. It is a technical rescue interface between speech and realization.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Gate frame/opening distinction preserved.
- [x] 能詮/所詮 logic preserved.
- [x] Dual exit register (expedient/real) preserved.
- [x] "Play" diagnostics preserved across view/desire/five-dust patterns.
- [x] Five-turbidity mapping preserved.
- [x] Witness continuity preserved (`[6] 名【大】，為【甲】`).
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
