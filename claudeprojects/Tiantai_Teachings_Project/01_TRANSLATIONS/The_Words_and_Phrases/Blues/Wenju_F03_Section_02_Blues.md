### The Light Goes East

Now we get to the big stuff. The first four lines of Maitreya's verses asked about This Land — what's happening right here in the assembly. But from "Brow Light" (眉間光) onwards, the next **fifty lines** ask about what the light revealed in **Other Lands** — the eighteen thousand Buddha-worlds to the east, lit up like a stage when the spotlight swings wide.

And here's where the old critics — Guangzhai and his crew — dropped the ball again.

They said: "In these verses, Maitreya doesn't ask about the Three Vehicles and Four Assemblies. He doesn't ask about the Buddha's Nirvana. Why not? Because this teaching abolishes the three vehicles — so why ask about them? Because the sutra is about to speak of the Lifespan — so why ask about extinction? It's inconvenient to the meaning, so he doesn't ask."

And Zhiyi — the Liner Notes Writer — puts down his pen, looks up, and says:

**"Alas! They do not understand how to make the text cohere. They press the Sutra to fit their own feelings."**

That line again. It's Zhiyi's refrain. The old critics keep forcing the Album to match their own review instead of listening to what the record actually says.

Now Zhiyi clarifies: the verses **do** fully ask about all Six Omens of Other Lands. The text breaks into **six items**:

1. **Three lines** — ask about sentient beings of the **Six Destinies**
2. **Four lines** — ask about seeing those **Buddhas** and their **expounding of Dharma**
3. **Three lines** — ask about the **Four Assemblies** of Other Lands
4. **One and a half lines** — conclude what came before and open what comes after
5. **Thirty-one and a half lines** — ask about cultivating **Bodhisattva Practices** in Other Lands
6. **Seven lines** — ask about **offerings to relics** — and *this is precisely asking about the Buddha's Nirvana*

You hear that? The old critics said Maitreya doesn't ask about nirvana. Zhiyi says: look at the stupa section — "offerings to relics" *is* the nirvana question. You build a stupa because the Buddha is gone. Asking about stupas *is* asking about extinction. The critics couldn't see what was right in front of them.

### 1. The Six Destinies: Who Goes Where and Why

First three lines. Maitreya looks out across those eighteen thousand worlds and he sees **sentient beings of the Six Destinies** — the whole spectrum of existence.

Zhiyi breaks it down with surgical precision. When you examine this verse, he says, you understand that the earlier phrase "Light Illuminating all in the East" had the intent of **Generally Illuminating Other Lands**. This verse praises and recounts that General Question.

Now, the Six Destinies — hell, hungry ghosts, animals, asuras, humans, devas — Zhiyi reads the verse as laying out a complete map:

- **"Sentient beings of Six Destinies"** — these are the **Persons Who Go** (能趣之人). The travelers.
- **"Birth and Death"** — this is the **Place Gone To** (所趣之處). The destination.
- **"Good and Evil Karma Conditions"** — these are the **Causes of Going** (趣因). What put you on the road.
- **"Beautiful and Ugly"** — these are the **Results of Going** (趣果). What you look like when you arrive.

Four elements. Person, place, cause, result. That's the whole cycle of rebirth packed into three lines of verse. Maitreya looks across those worlds and he sees *everything* — every being on every road, carrying every kind of baggage, arriving at every kind of door.

### 2. Seeing Buddhas and Dharma: The Opening Track in Every World

From "Also seeing the Buddhas" (又覩諸佛) onward — four lines — Maitreya asks about seeing the Buddhas of those Other Lands and directly seeing them **Expound Dharma**.

Zhiyi says this section broadly clarifies the marks of Dharma-expounding. What does that mean? It means expounding the **Sudden Teaching** (頓教) — the full, uncompromised Album, no demos, no rough mixes — delivered to meet the **Great Root Nature** (大根性). These are the listeners who can handle the whole thing at once.

"Sage Lord Lions" (聖主師子) — that's like This Land manifesting the image of **Vairocana** (盧舍那), the Reward Body Buddha. The glorious, radiant form that appears when the teaching is at its peak.

Now check the parallels. Zhiyi maps every phrase in the verse back to This Land's teaching history:

- **"Expounding Sutra Dharmas, subtle, wondrous, and foremost"** — that's like This Land where the Buddha first illuminated the High Mountains and expounded the *Avatamsaka* (Flower Garland) teaching. The biggest, most complete teaching, given first to the sharpest listeners.

- **"Teaching various Bodhisattvas"** — that's like This Land's **Seven Locations and Nine Assemblies** (七處九會) of the *Avatamsaka*, where there were no Sravaka people at all. Just bodhisattvas. Pure big-vehicle crowd.

- **"Illuminating Buddha Dharmas, opening and awakening sentient beings"** — that's like This Land where beings begin to see the Buddha Body and enter the Tathagata Wisdom.

You see what Zhiyi is doing? He's showing you that what Maitreya sees in Other Lands is a mirror of what happened in This Land. The same Album gets pressed in every world. The tracklist is the same. The Artist never changes the set.

### 3. The Four Assemblies: After the Big Opening, the Gradual Teaching Begins

From "If persons encounter suffering" (若人遭苦) onward — three lines — Maitreya asks about the Four Assemblies of That Other Land. And Zhiyi says: this is *after* the Sudden Preaching. What comes next? The **Tripitaka Teaching** (三藏教) — the gradual path for those who weren't ready for the full Album on the first listen.

And here Zhiyi gives us a beautiful breakdown of four kinds of suffering people:

**Type 1**: People who encounter suffering and create *evil* karma. Suffering doesn't end. These are the "Bottom" sentient beings — stuck at the lowest level, digging deeper.

**Type 2**: People who encounter suffering and create *good* karma. But suffering *still* doesn't end. They loathe the lower realms and climb toward the heavens — like Nanda, who held precepts because he wanted celestial women. Doing the right thing for the wrong reason. Still spinning on the wheel.

**Type 3**: People who encounter suffering and seek liberation in **Outer Path** (外道) dharmas — non-Buddhist philosophies. They increase views and grow errors. Suffering doesn't end either.

**Type 4**: People who encounter suffering, **loathe arising** (the Second Noble Truth — the cause of suffering), loathe even their bodily existence, and move the Buddha to speak of Nirvana. *This* person — and only this person — can "exhaust the boundaries of all suffering." Other Lands open this vehicle too.

That's the **Sravaka Vehicle** — opened for those who hear the truth of suffering and follow it all the way to cessation.

Then: "If a person has blessings" (若人有福) — one line — this opens the **Middle Vehicle**, the Pratyekabuddha path. These folks have more merit than the sravakas. A sravaka plants blessings over three lifetimes; a pratyekabuddha plants blessings over a hundred kalpas. They're deeper in. They deeply seek the superior and subtle principle of dependent arising.

And: "If there are Buddha-sons" (若有佛子) — this opens the **Mahayana of the Six Paramitas**. True compassion continues the Buddha-seed, so they're called "Buddha-sons." They cultivate the Six Paramitas — giving, precepts, patience, exertion, meditation, wisdom — and aspire to unsurpassed wisdom. Within the Six Paramitas there are no six hindrances, like medicine that contains no disease. So it's called the "pure path." But — and here's the catch — **it's not ultimately pure**. Not yet.

And check this: Zhiyi maps each vehicle to a different Noble Truth as its contemplation gate:
- **Sravakas**: The Truth of Suffering is their gate
- **Pratyekabuddhas**: The Truth of Arising is their gate
- **Six-Paramita Bodhisattvas**: The Truth of the Path is their gate

Three vehicles, three entry points, three gates into the same building. Different doors, same house.

### The Lesson

When the light from the Buddha's brow sweeps across eighteen thousand worlds, Maitreya sees the same thing everywhere: suffering beings on the road, Buddhas preaching the full Album to the ready listeners, then opening gentler tracks for the rest. Three vehicles, three doors, three gates — but all leading into the same house. The Album is playing in every world. The only question is which track you're ready to hear.
