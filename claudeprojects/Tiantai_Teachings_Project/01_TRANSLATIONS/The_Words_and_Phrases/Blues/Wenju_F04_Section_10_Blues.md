### The Setup

Now listen.

After the long argument room, Zhiyi does something elegant: he rethreads the whole line.

He shows how contemplation, gate, wisdom, position, and principle interlock. Then he clarifies how the Four Ones can be read by convenience from different angles without breaking their shared root.

This is closure with structural integrity.

---

### The Interlock Chain

Zhiyi's chain runs like this:

- contemplation opens passage
- passage enables wisdom
- wisdom establishes position
- position sees principle

So principle-one is not floating abstraction. It is the seen result of an integrated path process.

From there, he reaffirms: former expedient speech could talk in analogous terms, but what is decisive now is Buddha knowledge-and-vision in real-mode disclosure.

---

### Person-One and the Poor-Son Logic

When the text says the Tathāgata only teaches/transforms bodhisattvas, Zhiyi reads this through revealed identity logic:

Outwardly, many still self-locate as hired laborers. From the elder's side, son-identity is already the real line.

So person-one is not social flattening; it is ontological reclassification under revealed relation.

---

### Teaching One vs Practice One

A debated line can be read as teaching-one or practice-one depending on interpretive convenience.

Zhiyi allows this with strict control:

- from teacher-side emphasis, teaching-one is foregrounded
- from practitioner-side movement, practice-one is foregrounded

Either way, the direction is one: toward Buddha knowledge-and-vision.

So this is not relativism. It is angle-sensitive precision inside one vector.

---

### "Only One Buddha Vehicle" Clarified

Zhiyi rejects confused counting games around "no two" and "no three" when they preserve leftover partial systems.

His point:

One Buddha Vehicle here means pure round-teaching disclosure, not an arithmetic reduction that quietly keeps remainder scaffolds intact.

If "two" and "three" are removed in name but residual structures are still smuggled in, the closure has not happened.

He insists on real closure, not slogan closure.

### The General Conclusion of This Upper Fascicle Arc

Across past, future, and present Buddha chapters, components may appear in different local concentrations, but the core ones are fully present when read in total sequence.

Not every block repeats every component at maximum volume. But the architecture is complete.

Fascicle 4 Upper closes with this distributed completeness and hands forward to the next movement.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 理一 | Principle one | Single root-line of meaning | Final target of interlock chain |
| 人一 | Person one | One family-name under revealed relation | Reclassification in Buddha-facing identity |
| 教一 | Teaching one | One instruction stream | Teacher-side interpretive convenience |
| 行一 | Practice one | One operating path-line | Practitioner-side interpretive convenience |
| 但以一佛乘 | Only one Buddha vehicle | No remainder cut | Strict closure against partial carry-over |
| 四一兼足 | Four ones fully present together | Distributed full mix | Completeness without forced redundancy |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi closes this arc by turning argument back into architecture. Different labels can be foregrounded from different sides, but they all run one line when the reading is sound. The test is simple: does the interpretation actually carry beings into Buddha knowledge-and-vision without remainder drift? If yes, it belongs. If not, drop it.

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Interlock chain preserved (contemplation -> gate -> wisdom -> position -> principle).
- [x] Person-one logic preserved via poor-son/elder relation without flattening process stages.
- [x] Teaching-one/practice-one dual-angle reading preserved as convenience, not contradiction.
- [x] "One Buddha vehicle" clarified against residual partial-system carry-over.
- [x] Distributed-completeness conclusion preserved for fascicle closure.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
