### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi immediately explains why those three non-seekings were held.

He does not mock them.

He shows their internal logic before surpassing them.

---

### Explanatory Order

The explanations are sequenced intentionally:

- what was thought attained
- why larger pursuit seemed inappropriate
- how long habituation reinforced that stance

This preserves the psychology of sincere but limited certainty.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 18 preserves continuity of dignity in the disciples' earlier position.

That continuity is crucial for credible transformation later.
