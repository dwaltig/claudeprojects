### The Setup

Now listen.

This block isolates the fear reaction:

the child sees overwhelming force and flees.

Zhiyi reads the force as wisdom-power and skill-power,
then explains the panic as small-capacity dread of great-path demands.

---

### Fear Logic

The child privately thinks:

this is not my work-place;
if I stay, I will be forced into what I cannot bear.

So fleeing is not random fear.

It is a capacity mismatch under high-intensity display.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 31 explains why immediate full-great teaching cannot be forced,
even when fatherly intent is pure.
