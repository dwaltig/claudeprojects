### The Setup

Now listen.

After the matrix Q&A, Zhiyi answers the sharper strategic question:

Why, in broad terms, do Five Corruptions seem to obstruct Great-Vehicle reception more than Small-Vehicle reception?

He answers with pedagogy, pathology, and siddhānta structure all at once.

---

### The Old-Doctor Analogy

Zhiyi says beings in heavy corruption misread the medicine itself.

They grasp wrongly, take false as true, and cannot read dosage, cause, or contraindication. So when they hear high Mahāyāna claims (like permanence/self in ultimate framing), they can invert meaning and deepen error.

That is why the Great can be obstructed in a specific way.

He likens this to an old doctor facing stubborn patients who cannot tell:

- good milk from bad milk
- disease root from surface symptom
- when to administer versus withhold medicine

No diagnostic literacy, no deep-dose safety.

---

### Why the Small May Still Function

When teaching impermanence, suffering, and emptiness at a fitted level, beings can at least:

- loosen coarse attachment
- develop revulsion toward cyclic suffering
- orient toward release

So the Small route can still operate as a valid obstruction-reduction channel under heavy turbidity.

This is not a final destination claim. It is a skillful sequencing claim.

---

### Four Siddhāntas Applied to Five Corruptions

Zhiyi then classifies by siddhānta function:

- kalpa and lifespan -> worldly siddhānta field
- sentient beings and views -> for-the-person siddhānta field
- afflictions -> therapeutic/counteractive siddhānta field
- after these are worked through -> first-principle siddhānta (Great disclosure)

Meaning: three siddhāntas do cleanup work; first-principle siddhānta gives full disclosure when capacity is ready.

---

### Obstruction Taxonomy and Time-Scale Clarifications

Zhiyi also runs a compact taxonomy:

- cause/fruit relations across the five
- retribution obstruction and affliction obstruction interplay
- shared vs individual corruption distinctions
- inner/outer span differences
- short-life vs long-kalpa time scale distinctions

The line is rigorous: corruption language is not one undifferentiated blob. It is a layered analytic system.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Without this section, people accuse Lotus strategy of inconsistency.

With this section, the structure is clear:

- same ultimate intent
- different pedagogical release based on risk profile
- gradual obstruction-clearing before full-dose disclosure where needed

That is not compromise. That is compassionate systems engineering.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 一往 | Generally speaking | On the broad pass | Signals rule-at-large before finer exceptions |
| 四悉檀 | Four siddhāntas | Four teaching modes on one board | Pedagogical-functional classifier |
| 世界悉檀 | Worldly siddhānta | Field-condition framing | Names context-level realities |
| 對治悉檀 | Counteractive siddhānta | Medicine-against-this-ill mode | Targets afflictive obstructions directly |
| 第一義悉檀 | First-principle siddhānta | Full truth cut | Great-Vehicle direct disclosure mode |
| 二障 | Two obstructions | Double-noise lock | Retribution and affliction barriers in play |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi answers "why not teach the highest immediately" by showing that mis-hearing can be more harmful than delayed hearing. He stages truth-release by obstruction profile, then brings beings forward. One intent, many medicine strengths, no loss of final aim.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] "Great obstructed / Small passable" rationale preserved without denigrating either vehicle's pedagogical role.
- [x] Old-doctor diagnostic analogy preserved.
- [x] Four-siddhānta mapping retained as functional framework.
- [x] Obstruction taxonomy retained in layered form (shared/individual, inner/outer, short/long).
- [x] Sequencing logic preserved: cleanup first, full-disclosure after.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
