Now listen.

Fascicle 4 opens with the title card, then goes straight to work: from "Śāriputra asked three times" onward, this stretch is about **opening the three and revealing the one**. Zhiyi says this whole run spans seven and a half chapters, and he slices it in three teaching turns:

1. Dharma-statement for the sharp roots.
2. Parable-statement for the middle roots.
3. Past-causes-and-conditions statement for the heavy roots.

He says this is also principle, events, and practice moving together. Not three disconnected sermons. One teaching turning three faces.

## The Ten Meaning Grid

Then the Liner Notes Writer drops a diagnostic board with ten switches:

1. General and distinct.
2. Voice-hearer present or absent.
3. Delusion thick or thin.
4. Root turns or does not turn.
5. Root awakens or does not awaken.
6. Receives understanding or does not.
7. Gets prediction or does not.
8. Awakening shallow or deep.
9. Benefit provisional or real.
10. Waiting for time or not waiting.

This is Zhiyi telling you: do not read this chapter flat. Read the internal mechanics.

## One Turn Can Carry All Three

Question comes fast:

If three turns are for three root-types, and one turn can include all three statement-modes, does one statement then carry all three root-types too?

Zhiyi answers yes, functionally. The first turn is named for the superior root, but it is not sealed off from the other two. Same for the other turns. The names follow the main line, not the total payload.

That is classic Tiantai discipline: name by dominant function, do not erase the secondary functions.

## The Voice-Hearer Dispute

Then the pressure rises.

Guangzhai says real-practice voice-hearers are truly there. Kaishan says no, citing the *Śrīmālādevī Sūtra* line that three-vehicle beginners are not ignorant of Dharma.

Zhiyi says both are one-sided when absolutized.

- If you insist they are absolutely real, how do you handle Lotus statements that there are no voice-hearer disciples, only bodhisattvas being converted?
- If you insist they are absolutely absent, who enters the phantom city? What is the provisional leading, if there is no "three" to converge?

Then he gives the image cut that matters:

From the elder's real wisdom, there is no hired laborer.  
From the poor son's root-capacity, he still calls himself a hired laborer.

Same event, two standpoints. No lazy absolutizing allowed.

## The Treatise Frame

The *Lotus Treatise* gives four voice-hearer types:

1. Determinate.
2. Overweening.
3. Retreating from the Great.
4. Responsive-transformational.

The first two are not yet ripe for prediction. The latter two receive prediction.

Zhiyi then says: read this sutra carefully and you can articulate five categories in play. The opening one he names here is those long-trained in the small vehicle who mature in this life and certify fruit on hearing small teaching.

He is not flattening categories. He is refining them track by track.

## The Lesson

This opening is the discipline chapter inside the chapter. Zhiyi gives you the map before the hard walk: three turns, ten meanings, and a direct warning against one-sided doctrine. If you cling to "only real" or "only absent," you miss how the Lotus works. The teaching answers to capacity without surrendering the real. You have to hear both the elder's vision and the poor son's confession at the same time. That is where the track starts breathing.
