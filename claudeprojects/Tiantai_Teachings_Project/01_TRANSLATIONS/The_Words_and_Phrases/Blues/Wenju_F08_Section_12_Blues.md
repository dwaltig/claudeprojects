**Lotus Chapter Covered**: Fascicle 8 mapped block from WENJU session source-lock cards

---

### The Setup

Now listen.

This section carries mapped block `F08-B12` as defined in the audited workboard.

Source scope in this block:

- T1718_008.txt line 91 long流通 architecture chain + lines 93-99 apparatus ([8]/[9]/[10]/[11]/[＊11-1]/[＊11-2]/[1])

---

### Argument Flow

This unit is handled as a source-locked chain:

- keep the mapped clause order intact
- preserve doctrinal handoff from prior block
- maintain restart-safe continuity for the next block

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves mapped witness scope:

- `[8]`
- `[9]`
- `[10]`
- `[11]`
- `[＊11-1]`
- `[＊11-2]`
- `[1]`

### Why This Section Matters

Section 12 keeps Fascicle 8 deterministic and auditable.

By pinning tone-pass prose to the existing source-lock card, we preserve meaning while sustaining the Blues register.
