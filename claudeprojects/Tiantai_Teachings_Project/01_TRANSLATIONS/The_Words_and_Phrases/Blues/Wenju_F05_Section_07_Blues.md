### The Setup

Now listen.

After laying out expedient deployment, Zhiyi tackles the suspicion that naturally follows:

Did Buddha only come to know capacities later?

Section 7 says no, directly and repeatedly.

---

### The One-Line Function

Zhiyi marks this unit as a single line whose task is explicit:

**resolve doubt**.

That one line carries two doubts:

1. doubt about the Teacher (Buddha's discernment)
2. doubt about disciples (how quick Arhat attainment can happen)

---

### Doubt 1: "Did Buddha Initially Not Know?"

Question behind the question:

If Buddha had to "seek/think of past Buddhas," does that mean he lacked capacity-discernment at first?

Zhiyi's answer:

- not so
- Buddha already knew how to use expedients
- invoking the Buddhas is lineage-alignment for leading beings, not late discovery

He insists this is not first-time cognition. It is intentional pedagogical consonance.

---

### Long-Distant Kalpas and Habit-Matching

Zhiyi adds the deep-time frame:

From long-distant kalpas, Buddha has already seen these beings' tendency to delight in the small.

So praise, guidance, and route-preparation have been ongoing.

Result:

When small teaching is heard now, liberation can occur quickly because it matches long-formed habit-lines.

---

### Doubt 2: "How Can Brief Hearing in One Life Yield Arhat Result?"

Zhiyi answers with the same principle:

Quick attainment in this life is not a one-session miracle detached from history.

It ripens because present hearing matches deeply cultivated prior dispositions.

So "fast" here means mature seeds meeting proper conditions, not shortcut bypass.

---

### Rejecting a Misread About Lifespan Doctrine

He also rejects an older remote-reading move:

This verse is not a hidden early pointer to the later Lifespan teaching.

His argument is practical:

If even Maitreya did not yet know that teaching at its proper place, forcing it into this one-line doubt verse is misplacement.

So he keeps the verse on task: resolve local doubt in local context.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 7 protects doctrinal coherence on two fronts:

- Buddha's omniscient pedagogical integrity (no late awakening to what was unknown)
- disciples' rapid attainment without ahistorical simplification

It shows timing and depth are compatible when karmic history is included.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 釋疑 | Resolve doubt | Clear static before the next movement | Focuses interpretation by removing false inferences |
| 鑒機 | Discern capacities | Read the room all the way down | Core claim: Buddha already sees capacity conditions |
| 久遠劫來 | From long distant kalpas | Long-play karmic memory line | Grounds present teaching outcomes in deep temporal continuity |
| 樂小 | Delighting in the small | Small-form preference groove | Explains why small teaching can function quickly for some beings |
| 本習 | Original habit | Old training pattern in the bones | Key reason brief hearing can ripen rapidly |
| 顯露意 | Revealed intent | What this line is actually doing now | Keeps interpretation local and context-faithful |

### The Lesson

Zhiyi refuses the "Buddha learned late" story and the "disciples attained instantly from nowhere" story. He offers a stronger account: complete discernment plus long-range karmic preparation yields timely, fitted liberation.

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] One-line doubt-resolution function preserved.
- [x] Both doubt targets preserved (teacher and disciple).
- [x] "Not first-time knowing" clarified as lineage-aligned pedagogy.
- [x] Long-kalpa habit-ripening logic preserved.
- [x] Misplaced lifespan-prolepsis reading explicitly rejected per source logic.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
