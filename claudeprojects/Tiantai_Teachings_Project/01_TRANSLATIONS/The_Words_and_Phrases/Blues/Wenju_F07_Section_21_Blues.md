### The Setup

Now listen.

The sixteen royal sons enter as insistence-bearers.

They do not settle for partial hearing.
They repeatedly request full exposition over immense duration framing.

This is the engine of "re-requested complete-character wheel-turn" in this block.

---

### Why Re-Request Matters

Repetition here is not rhetorical clutter.

It does three things:

- confirms depth of vow and receptivity
- secures full instruction beyond abbreviated delivery
- keeps the lower-root horizon linked to eventual full-path uptake

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B21 apparatus continuity:

- `[4] 王子【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[5] 劫【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[6] 此【大】，〔－〕【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 21 shows how repeated appeal becomes a doctrinal mechanism.

Persistence under long time is treated as skillful means in action.

not because truth changed, but because hearts need full rain.
