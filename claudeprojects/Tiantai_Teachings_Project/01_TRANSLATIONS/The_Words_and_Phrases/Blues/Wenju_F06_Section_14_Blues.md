### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi opens by reporting multiple proposals that divide "belief-understanding" into three phases:

- initial conversion phase
- follow-up cultivation phase
- final consummation phase

Different teachers assign these phases to different doctrinal timelines.

---

### Early Objection

Zhiyi's critique begins immediately:

if "initial" is truly not the original intent and "consummation" is truly final,
then certain allocations collapse into contradiction.

He challenges sequences that call former-great teaching merely "initial" while also claiming later positions as uniquely final.

The logic does not hold consistently.

### What This Block Secures

This opening slice establishes method:

- report views fairly
- test internal coherence
- reject attractive but unstable layering

It sets up the deeper continuation in the next block.

---

### Witness Discipline

This B14 slice preserves:

- `[10] 又【大】，又云【甲】`
- `[11] 箇【大】，筒【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 14 protects interpretive rigor at the chapter threshold.

Before building a positive reading, Zhiyi clears incoherent frameworks.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 信解三法 | Threefold belief-understanding model | Three-stage reading scheme | Reported framework under critique |
| 一往化 | One-pass transformation | First pass delivery claim | Candidate "initial" phase assignment |
| 隨逐化 | Follow-along transformation | Ongoing tracking formation | Candidate middle phase assignment |
| 畢竟化 | Ultimate consummation transformation | Final lock claim | Candidate completion phase assignment |
| 非本懷 | Not original intent | Off-center from core vow-line | Zhiyi's criterion against misclassification |
| 宗極 | Doctrinal culmination | True final summit | Test point for consistency claims |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi starts 信解品 by refusing pretty sequences that cannot survive their own logic.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] B14 opening-dispute setup preserved.
- [x] Three-phase model family preserved as reported views.
- [x] Coherence-test critique preserved at opening level.
- [x] Witnesses `[10]/[11]` preserved.
- [x] No spill into B15's line-135 continuation witness scope.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
