Now listen.

Not everyone comes to the path willingly. Some are pushed. Some are tricked. Some are so attached to love that the Buddha has to take them on a tour of heaven and hell before they get the point.

These two Nandas are not the same person — one is "Cowherding Nanda" and the other is "Sundarī's Nanda" (the Buddha's half-brother). But both share something: they didn't want to leave home.

## Nanda (難陀): Good Joy — The Conscripted Monk

### The Name

> "Nanda (難陀): Also called 'Cowherding Nanda.' Translated as 'Good Joy' or 'Delight.' King Śuddhodana forced ten thousand Śākyas to leave home; he was one of them."

Note that: *forced*. This wasn't a calling. This was a draft.

### The Four Teachings

| Teaching | Interpretation of Joy |
|----------|----------------------|
| Tripiṭaka | Phenomenal joy, but in principle there is no joy |
| Shared | Phenomenal joy *is* principle joy |
| Distinct | The Stage of Joy (*Pramuditā-bhūmi*) — the first bodhisattva ground |
| Perfect | The Abode of Joy (*Huānxǐ-zhù*) — the non-dual joy of Buddha-nature |

### Fundamental and Trace

> "He abides in the Reality Limit — neither joy nor non-joy; his trace is named 'Joy.'"

The fundamental self has no preferences. Pure presence. The trace-self, however, gets a name like "Joy" to teach the point.

### Contemplating the Mind

> "Contemplating the mind as corresponding to Principle in resemblance — thus it is called 'Joy Contemplation.'"

When the mind aligns with reality, even tentatively, there is joy. Not emotional joy — structural joy. The resonance of alignment.

## Sundarananda (孫陀羅難陀): Beautiful Love — The Buddha's Lovesick Brother

### The Name

> "Sundarananda (孫陀羅難陀): 'Sundara' is translated as 'Beautiful Love' or 'Upright.' 'Nanda' is as before."

He was born on the ninth day of the fourth month. He was four fingers shorter than the Buddha. His appearance was so magnificent that:

> "If he entered an assembly and there were those who did not recognize him, they would say 'The Buddha has come.'"

### The Problem: Sundarī

His wife was named Sundarī — also translated as "Beautiful." They were *inseparable*:

> "In eating and resting they never separated."

This is the setup for one of the most intense ordination stories in Buddhist literature.

### The Scene: The Forced Ordination

One day the Buddha came begging with Ānanda. Sundarananda was eating with his wife in a tower. He went to welcome the Buddha, and his wife said:

> "I must wait for my lord to return before we eat together."

Sundarananda told the Buddha:

> "How can a Wheel-Turning King's seed disgrace himself by begging?"

He took the Buddha's bowl to fill it. But the Buddha immediately returned to the monastery. When Sundarananda arrived:

> "The Buddha ordered his head to be shaved. Sundarananda clenched his fist and said to the barber: 'Do not bring a knife near the crown of the King of Jambudvīpa!' The Buddha pressed him and he could not stop it; thus his head was shaved."

He was ordained against his will.

### The Escape Attempts

The next day the Buddha and 500 bhikṣus were invited to a meal. Sundarananda asked to stay behind "to guard the monastery" — planning to flee. The Buddha:

> "Ordered his room shut and told him to sweep: the south door was shut and north opened, and he was made to sweep this side and that... Again he feared the Buddha's return, so he ran away."

On the road, he encountered the Buddha. He hid behind a tree — the tree rose into the sky.

> "Seeing him, the Buddha immediately called him and brought him back. 'Why did you leave?' He replied: 'Yesterday I separated from my wife; I was waiting to return and only then eat. I merely missed my wife, so I left.'"

### The Tour of Heaven and Hell

The Buddha didn't argue. He didn't shame. He took Sundarananda on a field trip:

> "The Buddha took him to tour the heavens and hells."

The text says simply *yún yún* — "and so on." But the implication is clear: Sundarananda saw what attachments produce. He saw celestial beauties. He saw hellish torment. He saw the arc of karma.

After that, he no longer ran.

> "Therefore, he marks this entry with the character 'wife' (*fù* 婦)."

### The Four Teachings

| Teaching | Interpretation of Joy |
|----------|----------------------|
| Tripiṭaka | Conventional Truth has Dharma Joy; Ultimate Truth has no joy |
| Shared | Conventional joy *is* true joy |
| Distinct | From Shared Dharma Joy, there is Conventional Joy and Middle Joy |
| Perfect | Shared Joy possesses *all* Dharma Joy |

### Fundamental, Trace, and Contemplating the Mind

> "As for Fundamental/Trace and Contemplating the Mind: they are as above."

Zhiyi says simply: *apply the same pattern*. The fundamental is joyless-joy; the trace is the reluctant monk named after his beautiful wife.

**The Lesson**: Not everyone enters the path gracefully. Some are shoved. Some run. Some get their trees levitated into the sky so the Buddha can catch them.

And yet — these are Arhats. These are the session musicians. The ones who didn't want to be here eventually became the ones who held the studio together.

If your entry to the path was messy, if you were dragged, if you ran, if you're still running — you're in good company.
