### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi turns to the future-Buddha verses and keeps the same architectural grammar:

- open three
- reveal one
- map Four-Ones through vow, teaching, practice, and principle

This is continuity, not a new doctrine.

---

### Key Verse Moves in the Future-Buddha Segment

He maps lines this way:

- "deliver beings" -> Person-One
- "Buddhas' original vows" -> Action-One
- future-Buddha teaching lines -> Teaching-One
- "this Dharma abides in Dharma-position" -> Principle-One

So the future field is not doctrinally hypothetical fluff. It is structurally identical One-Vehicle operation.

---

### "Dharmas Are Constantly Without Nature"

Zhiyi's reading is subtle:

- "without nature" is not nihilism
- "without nature" includes non-substantiality of fixed self-ground
- the "without-nature" itself is also not to be reified

Then: Buddha-seed arises from conditions.

- in delusion: ignorance as condition -> sentient-beings flow
- in awakening: teaching-and-practice as condition -> right awakening arises

Thus One-Vehicle teaching is the needed condition-field for Buddha-seed activation.

---

### Direct Cause and Conditional/Discerning Causes

He aligns these with Buddha-nature categories:

- direct-cause Buddha-nature
- conditional and discerning causes supporting manifestation

The core message: when one rises, all rise. These are not isolated causal fragments; they are integrated awakening dynamics.

---

### "Worldly Marks Constantly Abide"

Zhiyi reads this as suchness-position logic:

- awakened side and sentient side both grounded in suchness-position
- not two independent ontological universes
- "world" (aggregates/elements/fields) does not cancel direct-cause constancy

Hence Principle-One stands.

---

### Present-Buddha Verse Notes

In the present-Buddha segment, he tracks three emphasis lines:

- intention to transform for beings' safety
- revealing first quiescent extinction (Principle-One emphasis)
- knowing beings' practices and therefore opening expedients

Again, same composition: compassion with adaptive instruction, no split between real and method.

---

### Why This Section Matters

This section blocks both eternalism and nihilism, and blocks both rigid monism and loose pluralism.

Zhiyi gives dynamic non-substantial realism: conditionally arisen Buddha-seed unfolding within stable suchness-ground.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 常無性 | Constantly without nature | Stable no-fixed-core law | Guards against reifying essence while preserving lawful continuity |
| 佛種從緣起 | Buddha-seed arises from conditions | Awakening germ needs right weather | Links One-Vehicle teaching/practice to actual awakening emergence |
| 法住法位 | Dharma abides in Dharma-position | Each track sits in suchness key | Principle-One formulation |
| 世間相常住 | Worldly marks constantly abide | Field-pattern continuity | Shows suchness-ground includes worldly structures without collapse |
| 第一寂滅 | First quiescent extinction | Original still-point cut | Present-Buddha revealing-real marker |
| 安隱 | Secure at ease | Nirvāṇa-stable room | Compassionate teaching goal and contrast axis |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi's future/present Buddha exegesis says the same thing everywhere: One Vehicle is not a slogan for one historical moment. It is the operating law by which conditioned beings can awaken when teaching, practice, and principle line up.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Future-Buddha two-part structure preserved (open three / reveal one).
- [x] Four-Ones mapping retained in verse terms.
- [x] "Without nature" interpreted without nihilistic flattening.
- [x] Buddha-seed conditional-arising logic preserved.
- [x] Principle-One and worldly-constancy relation retained.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
