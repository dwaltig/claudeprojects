### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi stages two naming questions:

- if this section speaks past-life causes so much, why not title it that way?
- if city is provisional and treasure-place is real, why title from the provisional side?

He answers both without contradiction.

---

### Resolution Chain

The naming rule is functional and strategic:

- beginning, middle, and end scopes are all present
- "city" marks the central pedagogical turn where readers most need orientation
- knowing city-as-transformation is exactly how one is led to treasure-place-as-real

So choosing "Magic City" does not abandon the real.
It secures entry to the real through intelligible sequence.

### Witness Discipline

This F07-B19 block is mapped as a dual Q/A sequence with no additional apparatus bundle in scope.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 19 protects title hermeneutics.

Without it, readers split method and destination, then misread why provisional language is retained.

### The Lesson

A wise title meets the traveler where confusion starts,
then walks that traveler to what is real.

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] F07-B19 dual Q/A logic preserved.
- [x] Naming-priority argument preserved.
- [x] Provisional-title without loss-of-real doctrine preserved.
- [x] No spill into B20 long architecture/apparatus bundle.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
