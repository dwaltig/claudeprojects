### The Setup

Now listen.

At the right moment, the guide changes mode:

- the provisional city is no longer maintained as final
- the group is reoriented toward the treasure place

This is the decisive handoff in the parable.

---

### Transition Integrity

If dissolution happens too early, travelers collapse.
If too late, they attach to the city.

So timing is everything:

- city first serves life
- then city is released
- treasure trajectory becomes explicit

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B29 apparatus continuity:

- `[4] 竟【大】，盡【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 29 is the anti-attachment pivot.

It demonstrates how skillful means must be relinquished when its protective function is complete.
