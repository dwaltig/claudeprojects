### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi moves into the verse section and immediately says the function: stop slander-mind by establishing no-falsehood.

He gives a three-step trust ladder:

1. trust Śākyamuni's true speech
2. trust all Buddhas' same-path testimony
3. conclude one-vehicle exclusivity without leftover vehicle residue

Then he maps the verse architecture in detail.

---

### Macro Verse Map

He says the second verse set has 121 lines, split into:

- a short permission-to-answer recap segment
- a large correct-answer expansion segment

Then he subdivides again:

- Four-Buddha chapter verses
- Śākyamuni chapter verses

Then inside Four-Buddha chapter:

- all Buddhas
- past Buddhas
- future Buddhas
- present Buddhas

This is composition-level scoring, not only exegesis.

### Three Differences Between Prose and Verse

Zhiyi identifies key prose/verse differences:

- what appears in one may be absent in the other
- order can interleave differently
- open/combined structuring can differ

Example pattern he notes:

- prose foregrounds rarity praise where verse foregrounds five-corruption handling
- prose and verse may swap the local order of opening provisional / revealing real vs no-falsehood emphasis
- exhort-faith and no-falsehood may be merged in one format, separated in another

So structural variation is intentional compositional adaptation, not doctrinal conflict.

---

### The Five-Thousand Memory Is Still Active

In the short recap layer, verse still carries:

- five-thousand withdrawal
- assembly purification
- admonition to listen

Then Zhiyi comments on pride patterns across the fourfold assembly and links "not seeing one's faults" to shameless self-covering.

He is still doing reception ethics, now inside verse commentary.

---

### Why This Matters

If we read verse as a duplicate of prose, we miss design.

If we read differences as contradiction, we miss design.

Zhiyi wants us to hear arrangement as part of meaning. Order, grouping, and compression are themselves doctrinally functional.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 無虛妄 | No falsehood | No fake notes in this line | Anti-slander trust anchor |
| 偈頌 | Verse section | Lyric-format dharma pass | Alternate compositional register for same doctrinal current |
| 許答 / 正答 | Permission to answer / correct answer | Greenlight / full statement | Two-layer argumentative structure in verse mapping |
| 彼此互無 | Mutual absence across sections | One track holds what another omits | Structural variation principle |
| 前後間出 | Interleaving front/back | Sequence crossfade | Non-linear ordering rule in verse composition |
| 開合不同 | Different opening/combining | Different cuts of same master tape | Compositional flexibility without doctrinal drift |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi reads the verse turn like an arranger reads alternate takes: same song, different mix, deliberate sequencing choices. If we force prose order onto verse, we flatten the craft. If we track the compositional shifts, doctrinal coherence gets stronger, not weaker.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] No-falsehood three-part trust ladder preserved.
- [x] 121-line verse macro-structure retained with major subdivisions.
- [x] Prose/verse three-difference framework preserved.
- [x] Five-thousand recap function retained inside verse transition.
- [x] Reception-ethics notes retained (pride, fault-blindness, shamelessness).
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
