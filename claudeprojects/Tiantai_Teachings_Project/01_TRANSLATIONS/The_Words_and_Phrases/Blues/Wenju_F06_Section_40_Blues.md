### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi maps formal transfer in four steps:

1. transfer timing
2. gather witnesses
3. confirm father-son relation
4. hand over household assets

---

### Public Legitimacy

He stresses witnessing and assembly not as theater,
but as legitimating structure for irreversible handoff.

This is lineage continuity under public seal.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 40 is the juridical-ritual heart of the entrustment movement.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves:

- `[5] 謂【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[6] 甞【大】，常【甲】`
- `[7] 言【大】，云【甲】`
