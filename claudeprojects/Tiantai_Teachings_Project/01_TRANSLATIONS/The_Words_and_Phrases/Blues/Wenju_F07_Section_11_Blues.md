### The Setup

Now listen.

A direct question is faced:

if the Buddha knows the One,
why not speak the One all at once?

Zhiyi answers through root-condition realism.

---

### Diagnostic Answer

The issue is not deficiency in truth.
The issue is receivability.

- soft or unready roots cannot yet sustain full disclosure
- temporary threefold teaching is spoken for complete eventual meaning

So sequence is compassion calibrated by capacity, not concealment for its own sake.

---

### Witness Discipline

This F07-B11 unit is a line-84 micro-segment with no additional apparatus bundle in scope.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 11 stabilizes pedagogical timing.

Without it, staged teaching appears contradictory rather than compassionate.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 佛知是已 | The Buddha, having known this | Prior full diagnosis | Establishes omniscient starting point |
| 何不即說 | Why not speak immediately | Urgency objection | Forces timing question into the open |
| 根機柔軟 | Roots are soft | Receptive fragility profile | Explains why immediate total disclosure may fail |
| 權說三乘 | Provisionally speaking three vehicles | Transitional track layout | Keeps learners in motion without rupture |
| 了義 | Complete meaning | Full doctrinal completion | Final aim of staged instruction |
| 決疑 | Resolving doubt | Objection closure mechanism | Restores coherence to teaching sequence |

---

### The Lesson

Truth can be one and delivery can be staged.
Compassion chooses timing without lowering destination.

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] F07-B11 line-84 doubt-resolution preserved.
- [x] Timing-by-capacity logic preserved.
