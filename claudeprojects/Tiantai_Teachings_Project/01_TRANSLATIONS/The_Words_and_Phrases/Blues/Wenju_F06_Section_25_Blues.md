### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi explains "search and pause" this way:

Buddha does not suspend all transformation in all places because one child's conditions are absent.

Pause is local; compassion work continues elsewhere.

---

### Country / City / House Expanded

He deepens the triad with realm-language and response-language,
then opens "great wealth" as full dharma inventory:

- reality-domain as house-base
- virtues as wealth
- practices and wisdom as assets
- resources for self-cultivation and other-benefit

---

### Officials, Servants, Vehicles

He layers symbolic personnel and vehicle imagery:

- ranks of practitioners mapped to roles
- contemplative powers mapped to vehicles
- entry/exit as one-many and many-one operations

This is a large systems map for how dharma administration works.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 25 keeps the parable from being reduced to one emotional family scene.

It is also a governance model for large-scale compassionate function.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves:

- `[2] 相【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
