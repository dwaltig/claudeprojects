### The Setup

Now listen.

A key question appears:

how can the great disciples know this long prior illumination design?

Zhiyi answers through near-to-far inference:

what is visible now implies long-prepared adaptive work.

---

### Fourfold Integration of Inducement

He integrates the full sequence:

1. initial proposal
2. recognition of capacity
3. praise framing
4. receiver response

Then extends into deep pedagogical interpretation,
including two-person inducement and gradual conditioning.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 35 is the hermeneutic bridge from visible narrative detail to long-range compassionate design.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves the B35 apparatus bundle:

`[7] [8] [9] [1] [2] [3] [4]`
