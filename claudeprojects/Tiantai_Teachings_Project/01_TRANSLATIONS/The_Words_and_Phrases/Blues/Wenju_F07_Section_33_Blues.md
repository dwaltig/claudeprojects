### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi asks where and how 開三顯一 is enacted across the textual field.

He identifies five sites, each with distinct role-pressure,
while keeping one doctrinal intention throughout.

---

### Five-Site Logic

The point is not multiplication for its own sake.

It is precision:

- each site handles a different learner-condition and argumentative burden
- together they form one integrated reveal trajectory

Difference of site does not mean difference of ultimate purpose.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B33 apparatus continuity:

- `[A2] 昔【CB】，音【大】`
- `[3] 譬【大】，喻【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 33 prevents site-confusion.

It shows how distributed teaching actions can still belong to one coherent liberation design.
