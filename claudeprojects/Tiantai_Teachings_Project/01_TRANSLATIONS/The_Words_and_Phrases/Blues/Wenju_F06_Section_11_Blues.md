### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi marks a new movement: exhorting faith and circulation.

He says this unit holds two linked concerns:

1. trusting Buddha's saying and not-saying
2. transmitting where one should and not should

---

### Two Chapters, Then Explanation

He structures the unit as:

- first, label the two chapter-heads
- second, explain them

"Saying" is for world-benefit at the right time.

"Not saying" is also compassion when timing and audience are not ready.

So restraint is not refusal; it is timing intelligence.

---

### Three-Time Benefit Lens

Zhiyi then frames teaching through past/present/future benefit discernment.

If benefit-conditions are present, one speaks.

If shallow understanding cannot hold it, one withholds.

This is doctrinal triage, not favoritism.

---

### Witness Discipline

This opening block preserves the B11 witness set:

`[7] [8] [1] [2] [3]`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 11 shifts from exposition to stewardship.

It defines transmission ethics as part of truth-care.
