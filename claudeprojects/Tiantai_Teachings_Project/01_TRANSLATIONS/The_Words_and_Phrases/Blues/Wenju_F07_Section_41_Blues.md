### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi closes the arc by correcting disciple self-estimation:

they are not mere assistants to the Buddha's speech.

This line turns reception history toward deeper root disclosure,
then seals the fascicle boundary cleanly.

---

### Closure Function

This block does three jobs:

- completes the 顯本 (fundamental-reveal) movement
- locks the final witness line for this doctrinal unit
- marks deterministic end-of-fascicle handoff

No spill, no blur, no loose edge.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B41 witness continuity:

- `[3] 次頁[01]不分卷【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 41 is the terminal lock for Fascicle 7.

It protects both doctrinal closure and production continuity before F08 begins.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 汝等勿謂助宣我法 | Do not think you only helped proclaim my Dharma | Receiver-identity correction line | Reframes disciples as integral participants in deep transmission |
| 顯本 | Revealing the fundamental | Root-layer disclosure | Pulls trace-level reception back into foundational continuity |
| 卷尾邊界 | Fascicle-end boundary | Hard stop seam | Prevents cross-fascicle argument bleed |
| 見證鎖定 | Witness lock | Variant integrity seal | Keeps textual accountability at closure |
| 收束節點 | Closure node | Final command point | Marks completion before handoff |
| 轉卷承接 | Roll transition handoff | Next-fascicle launch seam | Creates restart-safe continuity |

### The Lesson

A good ending does not just stop.
It teaches who we are in the line, then hands forward clean.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] F07-B41 顯本 closure chain preserved.
- [x] Line-308 witness continuity preserved.
- [x] Line-310 fascicle-end boundary preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
