### The Setup

Now listen.

The text asks sharply:

if the child was originally not inside, why say he entered through play?

Zhiyi answers with two complementary readings.

---

### First Reading: Once Out, Then Retreat

One can be said to "come out" by initial awakening-intent.

If that intent recedes, one is "back in" again.

Zhiyi uses a simple image:

like lifting the foot toward the door and then turning back.

So "out" and "in again" can both be true across sequence.

---

### Second Reading: Original Purity, Then Ignorance-Play

At the level of principle:

- nature is originally pure and not three-realm bound
- because of ignorance, discursive play starts
- with discursive play, birth-and-death unfolds

Thus "came in by play" names the arising of samsaric fabrication.

---

### Closing Diagnostic Line

Zhiyi seals the hinge:

- great good not yet established -> "small/immature"
- covered by ignorance -> "without knowing"

Then hearing the warning gives rise to startled entry into fear-awareness.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 05 clarifies that entry into the burning house is not a single flat event.

It can be read as historical retreat and as principled obscuration.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 因戲來入 | Entered due to play | Drifted in through delusion-play | Names samsaric entry mechanism |
| 曾發心 | Previously aroused aspiration | Once stepped toward the door | Marks initial exit tendency |
| 退還 | Retreating back | Turned back into the house | Explains re-entry after initial awakening motion |
| 理性本淨 | Principle-nature originally pure | Original clean ground | Non-samsaric baseline at principle level |
| 無明戲論 | Ignorance discursivity | Delusion chatter engine | Produces birth-death sequence |
| 稚小無知 | Immature and unknowing | Undergrown goodness, covered mind | Final diagnosis of child-state in this unit |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi gives hope and warning together: original purity is real, but backsliding through play is real too.

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Q/A polarity preserved.
- [x] Two-answer structure preserved (retreat logic + original purity logic).
- [x] Doorstep-turnback image preserved.
- [x] Line-73 diagnostic close preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
