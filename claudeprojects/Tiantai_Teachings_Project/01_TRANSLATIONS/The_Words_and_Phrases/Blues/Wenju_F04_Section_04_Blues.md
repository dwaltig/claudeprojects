### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi turns to a sharp question from the room:

If understanding is shared across lines, why do we see explicit prediction language weighted toward voice-hearers? Where are the pratyekabuddha and bodhisattva predictions in the same register?

He answers with a three-part frame and then seals it with a Q/A.

### Meaning 7: Obtaining Prediction or Not

Zhiyi's first move is historical:

The two vehicles had long been treated as fixed in limited attainment. So when Lotus opens the return into the Great, explicit prediction naming (kalpas, lands, destiny) has a corrective force. It answers prior closure.

Second move:

Do not say bodhisattvas have no prediction. There are specific prediction cases already present (including famous edge cases), and chapter statements that extend prediction across seekers of the different paths.

Third move:

Prediction depth differs by level. Near-stage prediction exists, but bodhisattva aspiration is toward far, ultimate, perfectly complete awakening prediction. So "not repeated here" is not "not present at all."

Zhiyi's point: textual economy and doctrinal depth both matter.

### Q/A: If the Small Awakens to the Great, Why Give Eight-Phase Prediction?

Question:

If small-vehicle listeners awaken to the Great, should they not receive dharma-body prediction directly? Why still give the response-manifestation (eight-phase) form?

Answer:

Eight-phase prediction is response-oriented and pedagogical. It establishes a visible path-marker for beings, while implying origin-ground continuity behind it. It is not denial of deeper prediction; it is functional disclosure fitted to audience and timing.

And Zhiyi adds: once they hear the *Life-span* chapter, the dharma-body register is also entered.

So this is staged revelation, not contradiction.

---

### The Reading Rule Here

Do not read prediction forms as mutually exclusive silos.

- Response prediction can function as bridge language.
- Dharma-body prediction can be progressively disclosed.
- Different audiences hear different depths without breaking one path.

Lotus is not a single-volume shout; it is an arranged release.

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 得記不得記 | Obtaining prediction / not obtaining | Named on the future bill or not yet named | Tracks disclosure of buddhahood destiny |
| 授記 | Bestow prediction | Getting your future set announced | Formal assurance structure in sutra discourse |
| 八相記 | Eight-phase prediction | Response-manifestation roadmap | Audience-facing prediction form |
| 法身記 | Dharma-body prediction | Deep-body seal of awakening line | Ultimate-level prediction register |
| 劫國 | Kalpas and lands | Cosmic schedule and venue | Content of explicit prediction details |
| 損生增道 | Diminish birth, increase path | Less rebirth drag, more path-rise | Describes progressive deepening after hearing |

### The Lesson

Zhiyi is teaching us to hear prediction as layered speech. What is explicit for one group may be implicit or previously established for another. What is near-form disclosure in one chapter can open into deep-form disclosure in another. If we force one flat prediction model on every listener-line, we miss why Lotus speaks in staged clarity.

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Meaning 7 three-part rationale preserved (historical corrective, already-present bodhisattva prediction logic, depth distinction).
- [x] Core Q/A preserved (eight-phase vs dharma-body prediction compatibility).
- [x] Doctrinal sequence preserved (response disclosure now, deeper register explicit with life-span hearing).
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
- [x] No flattening of prediction categories.
