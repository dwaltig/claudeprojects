### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi enters the combined-verse section (thirty-four-and-a-half lines).

Its opening four lines summarize the combined-general parable.

---

### Four Explicit, Six Carried

He says these lines sing four direct intentions while still carrying six correspondences.

The sequence includes:

- elder correspondence (title/name/virtue)
- all beings as children (with thirty-sons implication)
- house and one-gate implication
- full suffering/fire correspondence

So compression remains structurally faithful.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 08 is a compact doctrinal index.

It reminds us the verse can abbreviate expression without losing mapping integrity.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves:

- `[10] 也【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
