### The Setup

Now listen.

Fascicle 5 opens by replaying the decisive moment after awakening: Buddha at the Bodhi site, full realization present, but teaching release still under review.

Zhiyi says this verse section turns on one mercy decision:

- the Great is true
- but not every ear can take full volume on first strike

So the sequence becomes: test Great fit, then open Three as compassionate entry architecture.

---

### The Core Structural Split

Zhiyi marks this verse span as twenty-seven and a half lines, with a two-part logic:

1. six and a half lines: thought to use Great-Vehicle transformation, but the fit is not yet workable
2. twenty-one lines: align with all Buddhas and deploy Three-Vehicle transformation according to capacity

This is not retreat from truth. It is release-order discipline.

---

### Three Moves Inside the First Part

Within the first six-and-a-half lines, he gives three steps:

1. test whether Great disclosure is timely
2. observe beings lacking receiving-capacity
3. suspend full Great-mode rollout for the moment

So "ceasing" here means pausing direct-full-dose mode, not abandoning One-Vehicle intent.

---

### "First Sat at the Place of Enlightenment"

Zhiyi reads "first" carefully:

Ultimate principle has no temporal sequence in itself, but compassionate teaching borrows time-sequence for beings.

So "first" names pedagogical beginning, not metaphysical beginning.

---

### Event-Level and Mind-Contemplation Readings

He layers two interpretive registers:

Event-level:

- Bodhi tree as actual awakening site
- gratitude to tree and ground
- walking contemplation before first broad release

Mind-contemplation level:

- "tree" as twelve-linked dependent-arising great tree
- deep contemplation yields bodhi
- "observing the tree" means wishing to shelter beings under the forest-shade of undefiled dharmas

He also links "walking" to Great-Vehicle thirty-seven aids-to-awakening in active path function.

---

### Three Weeks of Teaching Triage

Cited transmission memory gives the opening triage rhythm:

- first week: Dharma subtle, few can receive
- second week: assess upper/middle/lower roots
- third week: determine who should hear first

Then Vārāṇasī turning: Four Truths, repeated instruction, eventual arhat attainment by the five.

Zhiyi keeps this as compassionate calibration, not doctrinal downgrade.

---

### Why the Five Companions Matter in This Opening Memory

The five appear as karmically linked first-hearing recipients.

Zhiyi preserves both immediate narrative and deep vow-thread logic: first-hearing placement is not arbitrary chronology; it is vow, affinity, and readiness converging in one launch moment.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Fascicle 5 begins by protecting us from a common error:

"If Buddha doesn't teach full One immediately to all, maybe One isn't final."

Zhiyi answers: One remains final throughout. Sequence varies because compassion is accurate, not because truth is uncertain.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 始坐道場 | First sat at the place of enlightenment | First release seat after the master take | Marks pedagogical launch-point, not ultimate-time origin |
| 擬宜 | Test what is fitting | Soundcheck the room before full drop | Capacity-fit assessment before doctrinal release |
| 息大化 | Pause Great-mode transformation | Hold the high-voltage line for a minute | Strategic delay, not abandonment of One-Vehicle intent |
| 三乘化 | Transform by Three Vehicles | Three-entry channels for overloaded ears | Compassionate staging architecture |
| 觀樹 / 經行 | Observe the tree / contemplative walking | Read the source, pace the hall | Reflective transition from realization to teachable sequencing |
| 三十七品 | Thirty-seven aids | Full practice toolkit grid | Operational path framework behind compassionate teaching rollout |

---

### The Lesson

Buddha's first teaching move after awakening is not maximal volume, it is perfect calibration. Zhiyi wants us to trust this: the highest truth can remain intact even when its first delivery is stepped, staged, and tuned to capacity.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Two-part line structure preserved (6.5 + 21).
- [x] Three-step logic preserved (test, observe no-capacity, pause direct Great rollout).
- [x] "First" interpreted pedagogically, not as metaphysical clock-time.
- [x] Event-level and contemplation-level readings both preserved.
- [x] Three-week triage logic retained as compassionate sequencing.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
