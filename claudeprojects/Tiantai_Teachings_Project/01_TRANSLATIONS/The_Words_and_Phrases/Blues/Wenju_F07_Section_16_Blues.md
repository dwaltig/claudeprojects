### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi marks this as the fourth segment in the parable-speech progression.

He explains why no extra fifth segment is split out:

- prior understanding and confirmation are already folded into prophecy operations
- textual brevity and structural fit keep them embedded

Then he lays two tracks:

- directly bestowing prophecy to medium roots
- promising later explanation of past-life links for lower roots

---

### Structural Stakes

The architecture prevents omission anxiety.

Even when a section is not separately labeled, its function is still carried in the live structure.
That is how continuity is preserved across compact textual turns.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B16 anchor continuity:

- line-anchor `[7]` (right/image duration marker)
- line-anchor `[8]` (land-purity marker)
- line-anchor `[1]` (lower-root past-link promise marker)

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 16 is the scheduling bridge.

It tells us who gets immediate formal confirmation and who receives a promised explanatory expansion to prevent discouragement.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 譬說第四段 | Fourth segment of parable-speech | Stage-four architecture node | Locates this unit in macro progression |
| 正與中根授記 | Correctly bestowing prophecy to medium roots | Mid-root confirmation release | Defines immediate recipient scope |
| 許為下根宿世之說 | Promise to speak past lives for lower roots | Deferred explanatory promise | Maintains hope and continuity for slower uptake |
| 長行 / 偈頌 | Prose / verses | Expository rail / recitative rail | Dual delivery structure for same teaching line |
| 宿緣 | Past-life conditions | Deep-time relation ledger | Grounds present reception history |
| 先許後說 | Promise first, explain after | Pastoral sequencing rule | Stabilizes learners before full detail unfolds |

---

### The Lesson

Good teaching does not abandon slower hearts.
It marks the schedule and keeps everyone in the story.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] F07-B16 fourth-segment architecture preserved.
- [x] Medium-root immediate prophecy and lower-root deferred explanation both preserved.
- [x] Embedded-function logic (without extra chapter split) preserved.
- [x] Anchor witnesses `[7]/[8]/[1]` preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
