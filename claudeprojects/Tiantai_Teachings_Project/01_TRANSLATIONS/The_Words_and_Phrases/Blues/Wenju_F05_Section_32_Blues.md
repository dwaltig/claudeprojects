### The Setup

Now listen.

A concise question is raised:

why does Buddha not personally state "not false"?

---

### The Answer in Brief

Zhiyi records the direct reply:

- Buddha promised three and gave one
- self-assertion could be difficult to receive
- when Śāriputra says "not false," trust is easier to establish

So pedagogical credibility is calibrated through speaker-position.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 32 teaches rhetorical compassion:

sometimes truth lands better when voiced by the recipient-witness rather than the original speaker.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 佛何不自說 | Why not say it himself | Why doesn't the source self-certify? | Opens trust-process question |
| 許三與一 | Promised three, gave one | Expedient promise to ultimate gift | Core tension requiring explanation |
| 自說為難 | Self-saying is difficult | Self-certification friction | Notes rhetorical reception limit |
| 取信為易 | Taking trust is easy | Witness-speech persuades faster | Justifies delegating the statement |
| 身子說 | Śāriputra says | Receiver testifies | Strengthens communal trust uptake |
| 問答短軸 | Short Q&A axis | Compact doctrinal hinge | Small unit with high interpretive impact |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi honors form as much as content: who speaks can be part of how compassion works.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Short Q/A polarity preserved.
- [x] Trust-through-receiver logic preserved.
- [x] No additional claims added beyond the concise source answer.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
