### The Setup

Now listen.

Before Zhiyi moves into the Five Thousand leaving scene, he runs a dense Q&A cluster. This is doctrinal housekeeping with real stakes.

He keeps correcting one mistake: reading formula words too literally while missing the operating meaning.

---

### Q/A 1: If Requests Were Uneven, Why Say Three Rounds for Three Roots?

Question:

If Śāriputra's request pattern shifts (first broadly for all roots, then specifically for middle/lower), why say Buddha speaks three rounds for three roots?

Answer:

Because request is universal and teaching is universal, while reception differentiates by capacity.

- sharp root hears Dharma exposition and wakes
- middle root hears parable exposition and wakes
- lower root needs all three rounds and wakes

Zhiyi's rule is direct: follow meaning, not surface wording.

---

### Q/A 2: Past-Life Narrative vs Present/Future Parable Mapping

Question:

If past-life narrative is "past," does parable map present/future?

Answer:

The sutra may not spell every mapping explicitly, but inferentially yes: guiding three back to one carries a future-facing line, while raising concrete events into parable works at present disclosure level.

So the sequence is not random. It is temporally structured by function.

---

### Q/A 3: Is Ignorance Really an Obstacle or Not?

Question:

If ignorance is the obstacle, when exactly is it broken? If after hearing, does it still count as obstacle? If before hearing, was there ever an obstacle?

Answer:

Zhiyi harmonizes with the lamp-and-dark image.

When lamp rises and dark falls, you cannot force a crude before/after split. Yet darkness still truly functioned as obstacle.

This protects causal realism without clumsy temporal absolutism.

---

### Q/A 4: Other Sutras Say "They Know" — Why Here "They Doubt Then Awaken"?

Question:

If other texts say three-vehicle beginners "know" the path-direction, why does Lotus portray doubt and delayed awakening?

Zhiyi's reconciliation:

There are multiple senses of "beginning practice."

- One sense refers to long-ago contact with the Great: then "not ignorant" makes sense.
- Another sense refers to currently operating from small-vehicle cultivation with middle forgotten: then not-knowing makes sense.

He refuses contradiction games and refuses flat one-sense reading.

He also declines simplistic sharp/dull binaries as final explanation, and instead emphasizes a two-layer reading:

- provisional line may inwardly know
- real-practice line may not yet have entered the Great and thus not know

Again: layered status, not single-axis labeling.

---

### Q/A 5: How Can Pratyekabuddhas Be Present if They Arise in Buddha-less Ages?

Question:

If pratyekabuddhas are linked to Buddha-absent worlds, how can they appear in the three-round Lotus seat?

Answer:

Zhiyi expands typology.

There are vow-based and mode-based distinctions, including forms that can appear under different historical conditions, and transformational manifestations fitted to audience needs.

So presence here is doctrinally coherent, not a category error.

---

### Why This Cluster Matters

This cluster prepares the reader for the coming removal scene (Five Thousand leaving) by clearing bad inferences first.

If you do not clear these inferences, you'll read departure as pure rejection. Zhiyi is preparing a subtler reading: capacity, timing, and karmic linkage all stay in motion even when outward alignment breaks.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 隨義不隨語 | Follow meaning, not words | Read the score, not just the label | Governing hermeneutic rule in this Q&A block |
| 普請普說 | Universal request, universal speaking | Whole-room call, whole-room teaching | Distinguishes broadcast from differentiated reception |
| 三周 | Three rounds | Three-pass teaching cycle | Capacity-differentiated awakening sequence |
| 燈生闇滅 | Lamp arises, dark ceases | Light hit / dark drop | Simultaneity model for obstacle-resolution logic |
| 初業 | Beginning practice | First-pass track position | Multi-sense term requiring contextual interpretation |
| 部行緣覺 | Sect-practice pratyekabuddha | Lineage-trained solitary listener | Expanded typology for pratyekabuddha presence logic |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi is building interpretive stamina. He does not let one sentence cancel another when both can be harmonized by scope, timing, and term-sense. This is not compromise; it is precision. By the end of this cluster, the reader is trained to carry layered truth-claims without collapsing them into contradiction theater.

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] All five Q/A movements preserved in sequence.
- [x] "Follow meaning, not wording" treated as governing key.
- [x] Lamp/dark simultaneity model retained for obstacle logic.
- [x] Multi-sense "beginning practice" reconciliation preserved.
- [x] Pratyekabuddha presence explained via expanded typology, not simplification.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
