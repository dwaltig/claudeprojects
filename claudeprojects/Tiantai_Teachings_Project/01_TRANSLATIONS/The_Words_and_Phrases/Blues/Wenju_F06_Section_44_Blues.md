### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi continues the recap through:

- father sees child
- pursuit/inducement
- entrusted-household transfer
- combined-parable mapping

Then he rises into the gratitude-eulogy sequence.

---

### Recap Density

He tracks how recap verses compress many earlier prose layers,
including set-aside, inducement, labor-training, receiving, transfer, and joy.

He also keeps combined-mapping clarity where one line carries several prior units.

---

### Tenfold Grace Trajectory

In the concluding gratitude movement,
Zhiyi presents a cumulative grace arc:

from initial rescue-intent through full transmission and self/other completion.

This functions as devotional seal on doctrinal completion.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves the full B44 apparatus chain:

`[3] [4] [＊7-1] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [1] [2] [3]`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 44 is the recap climax and affective seal before fascicle closure.
