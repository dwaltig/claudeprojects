### The Setup

Now listen.

This is a major doctrinal courtroom section.

Zhiyi records the claim "only two vehicles request, bodhisattvas do not," then dismantles it.

---

### First Move: Redefining "Request"

He broadens the term:

- intention-level asking
- spoken asking
- embodied asking

Anyone not yet fully arrived is in some mode of asking.

So "request" cannot be reduced to one narrow verbal event.

---

### Ten Objections, Then Comprehensive Refutation

He lists ten objections and answers them across:

- scripture logic
- sequence logic
- capacity logic
- five-period teaching analysis
- four-teaching differentiation

Core claim:

limiting request to two vehicles is too narrow and misses the great-system reading.

---

### Multi-Layer Classification

Zhiyi allows multiple combinations:

- request / not request
- cut-delusion / not cut-delusion
- across Tripiṭaka, Shared, Distinct, and Perfect teachings

Then re-reads through milk/curds/fresh-ghee/cooked-ghee/clarified-butter phases.

His conclusion is inclusion with distinction, not flattening.

---

### Vehicle-Body Debate

He surveys competing views of "cart body" (vehicle essence).

Then affirms Tiantai position:

- dharma-real aspect is the cart body
- ornaments are adornments, not the core body

This anchors later "equal giving" interpretation.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 29 secures interpretive legitimacy for broad participation in great-vehicle seeking.

It keeps the parable from collapsing into a two-vehicle closure.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 索車 | Requesting carts | Asking for the promised way | Central contested act in this debate |
| 十難 | Ten objections | Ten-round challenge set | Opponents' argument matrix |
| 總別駁 | General and specific rebuttal | Full-spectrum answer method | Zhiyi's layered response strategy |
| 四教判 | Four-teaching discernment | Four-lens doctrinal sorting | Prevents one-level overreading |
| 五味歷判 | Five-flavor phase discernment | Teaching-era taste map | Historicizes request/no-request patterns |
| 諸法實相為車體 | Real aspect of dharmas as cart body | Truth-body as vehicle core | Tiantai resolution of vehicle-essence dispute |

---

### Witness Cluster Integrity

This block carries the largest apparatus bundle in F05 and must stay intact:

`[1]/[2]/[3]/[4]/[5]/[6]/[7]/[＊1-1]/[A1]` plus repeated variant lines.

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi refuses small interpretive gates. If liberation is universal in scope, the logic of asking must be universal in structure.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Ten-objection structure preserved.
- [x] General/specific refutation architecture preserved.
- [x] Four-teaching and five-period discriminations preserved.
- [x] Vehicle-body debate preserved with Tiantai resolution.
- [x] Full witness cluster continuity preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
