### The Setup

Now listen.

Once the Five Corruptions are named, obvious objections show up.

Zhiyi does not dodge them. He runs a matrix method: four-phrase distinctions, repeated across contexts, so readers stop using one hard rule for every listener.

This is capacity analytics, not doctrinal wavering.

### Q/A 1: If Turbidity Obstructs the Great, How Did Avataṃsaka Listeners Hear It?

Question:

If five-corruption obstruction blocks Great-Vehicle hearing, why did some hear the Great in the Avataṃsaka setting before full purification?

Answer:

Use four phrases:

1. sharp roots + heavy obstruction -> still not blocked because root sharpness overpowers obstruction
2. sharp roots + light obstruction
3. dull roots + light obstruction -> e.g., pure lands of other directions
4. dull roots + heavy obstruction -> e.g., this saha-world cohort like Śāriputra's group, needing obstruction-clearing before hearing Great

The key line: obstruction is real, but obstruction is not an absolute scalar independent of root quality.

---

### Q/A 2: Do the Five Corruptions Obstruct the Small Vehicle Too?

Zhiyi again applies four phrases, now in Small-Vehicle register:

1. sharp roots + light obstruction -> not blocked
2. sharp roots + heavy obstruction -> still not blocked (example: Aṅgulimāla-type reversal case)
3. dull roots + light obstruction -> not blocked (example: Cūḍapanthaka-type slow-memory but workable entry)
4. dull roots + heavy obstruction -> blocked; no hearing, no crossing

So "obstructs Great" does not mean "obstructs everything equally." It means transmission depth and entry-requirements differ.

---

### Q/A 3: What About Those Outside Avataṃsaka and Tripiṭaka Assemblies?

Question:

How can some hear Great or Small despite not being in those canonical assembly frames?

Answer:

Within each of the Four Teachings, classify entry through Four Gates:

- neither-empty-nor-existing gate
- both-empty-and-existing gate
- empty gate
- existing gate

Then map gate-entry by root/obstruction profile.

Zhiyi's move here prevents rigid historicism: dharma-entry is not locked to one event-site when gate-conditions align.

---

### One Method, Multiple Contexts

Across all three Q&A sets, the same method appears:

- do not absolutize one case
- classify capacities
- classify obstruction weight
- classify gate suitability
- assign pedagogical route accordingly

This keeps compassionate precision while preserving One-Vehicle destination.

---

### Why This Matters for Our Reading

If we read these Q&A units casually, they look like exceptions piled onto exceptions.

If we read Zhiyi's method, they become one coherent logic: **differential access under invariant intent**.

The intent line does not change. Delivery lines change according to roots, obstruction, place, and gate.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 四句分別 | Four-phrase discrimination | Four-lane diagnostic grid | Capacity/obstruction classifier used across disputes |
| 根利 / 根鈍 | Sharp roots / dull roots | Fast-ear / slow-ear capacity | Reception ability axis |
| 障重 / 障輕 | Heavy obstruction / light obstruction | Thick static / thin static | Obstruction intensity axis |
| 四教四門 | Four teachings, four gates | Multi-door entry board | Non-single-path access logic |
| 非空非有門 | Neither-empty-nor-existing gate | Beyond-binary door | Advanced entry mode for specific capacities |
| 空門 / 有門 | Empty gate / Existing gate | Subtraction door / structure door | Differentiated pedagogical routes |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi is teaching us to stop using slogans as doctrine. "Five corruptions obstruct" is true, but only when read with profile distinctions. The Dharma physician does not give one medicine for all constitutions. He gives one saving intent through many fitted gates.

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] All three Q&A clusters retained in sequence.
- [x] Four-phrase distinction logic preserved across Great and Small contexts.
- [x] Representative examples retained (Śāriputra cohort, Aṅgulimāla, Cūḍapanthaka profiles).
- [x] Four-Teachings/Four-Gates mapping preserved as method, not ornament.
- [x] No flattening into a single deterministic obstruction rule.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
