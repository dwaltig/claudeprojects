### The Setup

Now listen.

Fascicle Six closes with:

`妙法蓮華經文句卷第六下`

and its apparatus witness pair.

---

### Why This Final Seal Matters

This colophon is the deterministic endpoint for F06:

- marks completion boundary
- prevents bleed into F07
- preserves witness-layer traceability

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves:

- `[6] 妙法蓮華經【大】，法華【甲】`
- `[7] 下【大】，〔－〕【甲】` (+ colophon note chain)

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 45 confirms Fascicle 6 is complete in the tone-pass stream.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 卷第六下 | Fascicle Six Lower | Side-B final close stamp | Definitive endpoint marker |
| 卷尾題記 | Closing colophon | Final ledger line | Seals transmission unit |
| 見證鏈 | Witness chain | Variant trace line | Preserves textual accountability |
| 分卷終止 | Roll termination | Hard stop boundary | Prevents cross-fascicle drift |
| 可稽核終點 | Auditable endpoint | Verification-safe close | Supports deterministic workflow |
| 轉入第七卷 | Transition to Fascicle Seven | Next-run handoff | Declares onward continuation path |

---

### The Lesson

A clean ending is part of truth-work. The line closes exactly where the source closes.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] B45 colophon preserved one-to-one in function.
- [x] Witnesses `[6]/[7]` preserved.
- [x] Hard stop at fascicle end preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
