### The Chapter Title: 方便品 — "Skillful Means"

Now Zhiyi turns to the title of Track 2: 方便品 — the chapter the whole world calls "Skillful Means." Two characters. 方 (*fāng*) and 便 (*biàn*). And the Liner Notes Writer is about to show you that these two characters contain three completely different meanings, and only the third one is what this chapter is actually about.

The interpretation has a brief and a broad treatment. The brief has two parts: the explanation itself, and the analytical discrimination.

### Three Readings of 方便

**Reading 1: Dharma and Function**

"方 (*fāng*) is dharma; 便 (*biàn*) is function."

Dharmas have square and round. Functions have differences and meetings. The three provisionals are the carpenter's square — square. The one real is the compass — round. If wisdom reaches the square, you skillfully use partial dharmas to meet beings. If wisdom reaches the compass, you skillfully use perfect dharmas to meet beings.

This is the *pointing finger* reading: raise a finger to point at a partial place — that's raising partial dharmas to point to wisdom. Use dharma to explain 方, use function to explain 便.

Zhiyi says: this reading follows beings' desires, not the Buddha's original intent. Like sutras that cause you to leave attachments and escape the three realms. The Tathagata earnestly praises this kind of skillful means. "This meaning can explain other sutras; it is not the intent of this chapter."

**Reading 2: Gate**

"方便 is a gate. A gate is named for its ability to pass through."

Skillful means, the provisional, the abridged — they're all coaxing inducements, making a gate for the real. When the real is revealed, the merit belongs to skillful means. Because it *can* reveal, it gets the name. As the sutra says: "Opening the gate of skillful means, it reveals the real marks."

Zhiyi says: this too can explain other sutras. It is not the intent of this chapter.

**Reading 3: Secret and Wondrous — The Real Meaning**

"方 (*fāng*) is **secret**; 便 (*biàn*) is **wondrous**."

Now we're home. When wondrousness reaches secrecy, it is true secrecy. And Zhiyi gives two images:

*Pointing out the priceless pearl sewn in the lining of your clothing is not different from the single pearl on the king's crown — no two, no difference.*

*Pointing out that the hired laborer is the elder's son is also no two, no difference.*

You had the treasure all along. The servant was the heir all along. The Loving Tricks are not tools the Buddha uses *on* you — they are the revelation that what you already have *is* the real thing. Words like these are secret and wondrous, as the sutra says: "Only I know this mark; the buddhas of the ten directions are also thus." And: "Stop, stop — no need to speak; my Dharma is wondrous and difficult to conceive."

"Therefore, taking secret to explain 方 and wondrous to explain 便 is precisely the intent of this chapter." This is why it's called the Chapter of **Loving Tricks**.

### The Analytical Discrimination

Zhiyi maps the three readings to three different scopes:

| Reading | Type | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **Dharma & Function** | Skillful means *outside* the essence | Converting beings through provisionality — following others' intent |
| **Gate** | Also outside the essence | Self-practice and converting others — following self-and-others' intent |
| **Secret & Wondrous** | Skillful means *of shared essence* | Self-practice provisionality — following one's own intent |

And the philosophical precision:

- First reading: skillful means are neither what can enter nor what is entered
- Second reading: skillful means are what *can* enter but not what *is* entered
- Third reading: skillful means are what *is entered* but not what can enter

"Therefore, we know: although the name is the same, its meaning is greatly different. Most people in the world do not see this intent, and they recklessly explain 'Skillful Means.'"

### The Question of 方便 and 權 (Skillful Means and Provisionality)

**Question**: How are skillful means and provisionality related?

**Answer**: Four sentences distinguish them:

1. **Skillful means break provisionality, and provisionality breaks skillful means** — The four kinds of secret-wondrous skillful means break the provisional of following others' intent. Provisionality of shared essence breaks the skillful means outside the essence.

2. **Skillful means cultivate provisionality, and provisionality cultivates skillful means** — Mutual cultivation. Can be explained.

3. **Skillful means *are* provisionality, and provisionality *is* skillful means** — Mutual identity. Can be explained.

4. **Provisionality is skillful means with no two and no difference** — This is the intent of this chapter.

The first three sentences can explain other sutras. The fourth sentence is what Track 2 is about. And Zhiyi cites the *Proper Dharma Flower* (the alternative translation of the Lotus), which calls this the "Chapter of Good Provisionality": "Provisionality is precisely skillful means, with no two and no difference. Lowering the head or raising the hand — all accomplish the Buddha-path. Skillful means and good provisionality are both real."

That's the deepest reading of Loving Tricks: the trick *is* the truth. The provisional *is* the real. There never was a gap between them.

### The Broad Explanation: Demolishing Five Periods of Provisional and Real

Now Zhiyi goes broad — and demolishes every existing interpretation of provisional and real across the five periods of the Buddha's teaching career:

**Period 1 (Pre-12 years / Abhidharma)**: The old interpreters say illuminating impermanent events is provisional, illuminating impermanent principle is real. Zhiyi says: the *Treatise* breaks impermanence as an antidotal dharma — it all belongs to the three siddhāntas. "How could there be any real? It is not used here."

**Period 2 (Prajna)**: They say illuminating provisional existence is provisional, illuminating that provisional existence is emptiness is real. Zhiyi says: "Once conceptual contemplation is removed, verbal dharmas are all extinguished. Illuminating provisional existence as emptiness is still only contemplative ideation. It is not used here."

**Period 3 (Vimalakirti / Sīyì)**: They say inward contemplating empty-and-existent is real wisdom, outward transforming and responding is provisional wisdom. Zhiyi says: "Inward contemplation and outward function as two is not entering the non-dual gate. It is not used here."

**Period 4 (Lotus)**: They say illuminating the three threes is provisional, illuminating the four-and-one is real. Zhiyi says: "The three provisionals do not meet the real; the one real is not connected to the three provisionals. It is not used here."

**Period 5 (Nirvana)**: They say before the diamond-stage, impermanence is provisional; after the diamond, permanence is real. Zhiyi says: "Before the path, suchness is also permanent; after the path, wisdom-as-it-is is also provisional. It is not used here."

Five periods. Five rejected readings. "These five periods' provisional/real are not used here."

Then he demolishes six more partial readings of 方便 — "merely provisional," "provisional skill," "provisional provisionality," "provisional suitability," a balance-weight metaphor, and a four-kinds-of-two-wisdoms scheme. Each one "takes one route" and "none includes the others; the meaning does not merge into wondrousness. One cannot use these to explain this chapter."

And the alternative scheme — four kinds of two wisdoms with three turnings of the two truths — Zhiyi acknowledges as useful for *other* sutras but declares: "Now, examining those explanations in detail: they are merely relying on the five periods to display their own intent, rejecting the error of gradual step-ladders. They can explain other sutras; they are not the intent of this chapter."

The clincher: "The sutra says: 'All cause beings to gain seeing.' When is there any difference of opening and awakening between earlier and later?" And: "'Straightforwardly abandon skillful means' — how could one use gradual steps to meet the perfect wondrous?"

You can't get to the Lotus by climbing a ladder. The Lotus isn't at the top of anything. It's the ground you're already standing on.

### The Final Word: Four Sentences on All Dharmas

Zhiyi closes with four sentences that contain everything:

1. **All dharmas are provisional** — "Dharmas are such in nature, mark, essence, power, root, and end." Even the slightest utterance is provisional.
2. **All dharmas are real** — "The Tathagata skillfully speaks the dharmas, pleasing the minds of the multitude." The minds take entering the real as what pleases them. "Dharmas from the root onward are always of the mark of quiescent extinction." "All are real and not false."
3. **All dharmas are both provisional and real** — "Dharmas are like the real marks." This doubly clarifies that all are both provisional and real.
4. **All dharmas are neither provisional nor real** — (The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sutra*: the four sentences are all unspeakable.)

Four sentences. And the fourth one — neither provisional nor real — is where speech stops and the music begins.

### The Lesson

Two characters — 方便 — and Zhiyi finds three worlds inside them. The first reading says they're tools for reaching beings. The second says they're gates for reaching truth. But the third — the one this chapter is actually about — says the trick *is* the truth. Secret and wondrous. The pearl sewn in your jacket lining is the same pearl on the king's crown. The hired laborer is the elder's son. There was never a gap between the provisional and the real. And every other reading — five periods of them, six partial interpretations, three turnings of two truths — gets demolished not because they're wrong about other sutras, but because they're wrong about *this* one. The Lotus doesn't climb. It doesn't build. It doesn't open a gate to something else. It points at what was always there and says: *This. This is it. This was always it.*
