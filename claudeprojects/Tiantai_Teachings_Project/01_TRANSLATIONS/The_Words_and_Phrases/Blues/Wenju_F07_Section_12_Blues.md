### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi marks the verse body as a strict architecture:

- fifty-four and a half lines
- Dharma-speech and parable-speech
- two teachings and two wisdoms
- difference and non-difference layers

This is not ornamental versification.
It is controlled doctrinal replay.

---

### Structural Function

The verse unit does three jobs:

- re-states the prose in compressed form
- secures sequence memory for receivers
- keeps opening-three/revealing-one traceable under poetic density

So "repeating the source" means continuity with accountability.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves the F07-B12 witness bundle across lines 90-99:

- `[2] 教【大】，緣教【甲】`
- `[1] 植【大】＊，殖【甲】＊`
- `[2] 萄【大】，桃【甲】`
- `[3] 出【大】，出現【甲】`
- `[＊1-1] 植【大】＊，殖【甲】＊`
- `[4] 數【大】，量【甲】`
- `[5] （來至…法）七字【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[6] 上【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[7] 四【大】，四上【甲】`
- `[8] 生【大】，生而為說法也【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 12 locks the transition from prose exposition to verse recursion.

Without this lock, later Q/A readings lose the structural map that the verses are actively preserving.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 復宗稱述 | Repeating the source and praising | Source-recall relay | Maintains doctrinal continuity under compression |
| 法說 / 譬說 | Dharma-speech / parable-speech | Doctrine lane / image lane | Dual-channel transmission scaffold |
| 五十四行半 | Fifty-four and a half lines | Measured verse ledger | Prevents structural drift in recitation |
| 二教二智 | Two teachings, two wisdoms | Instruction pair / insight pair | Keeps provisional-real logic synchronized |
| 四悉檀 | Four siddhantas | Four-intent calibration grid | Maps pedagogical purpose across verse blocks |
| 譬帖 | Raised-parable matching | Re-anchoring image fit | Binds poetic image back to doctrinal target |

### The Lesson

When the line turns to verse, it is still engineering, not looseness.
Compression serves fidelity.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] F07-B12 verse-architecture chain preserved.
- [x] Dharma/parable dual structure preserved.
- [x] Two-teaching/two-wisdom logic preserved.
- [x] Full B12 witness bundle preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
