### The Setup

Now listen.

After naming corruption, Zhiyi names the counterline: purity.

Then he tightens the room: if someone calls themselves disciple but cannot hear, know, trust, and accept the One-Vehicle disclosure, that name-tag is under challenge.

This is not identity shaming. It is reception testing.

---

### Q/A: What Are the Five Clears?

Question:

If there are five corruptions, what are five clears?

Answer:

By analogy with the three poisons in evil and wholesome modes:

- evil mode corresponds to five corruptions
- wholesome mode corresponds to five clears

In purer lands where evil-poison momentum is light, five-corruption obstruction is light.

Simple equation, strong implication: obstruction density varies by karmic field quality.

---

### Enter the Fourth Turn: Reject the False, Urge the True

Zhiyi marks a new move in the chapter:

- discriminate true vs false disciple-status
- open exception pathways and resolve doubt

First he presses the present assembly hard:

If you are truly disciples, belief-and-understanding should follow hearing. If not, either hearing failed or pride hardened the channel.

---

### Two Failures Zhiyi Names

He gives two main failure forms:

1. not hearing / not knowing
2. hearing but not believing/accepting -> overweening pride

He uses transmission language:

A disciple inherits and follows the teacher's dharma-lamp. If there is nothing heard and known, what exactly is being inherited?

Then he sharpens the contrast:

Earlier, under five-corruption conditions, Buddha opened three and disciples followed that medicine. Now, with obstruction reduced, One-Vehicle disclosure is given. Why refuse the upgraded instruction?

---

### Four-Ones Reappear as the Diagnostic Frame

Zhiyi maps failure directly onto the Four Ones:

- not hearing -> failure of Teaching-One
- not knowing -> failure of Action-One
- not true arhat status -> failure relative to Principle-One
- not true disciple status -> failure relative to Person-One

So the Four Ones are not only interpretive theory. They are reception diagnostics.

---

### The Pride Warning

He warns against premature completion claims:

- "I am final body" while still unfinished
- "I am ultimate" while substantial path remains

Calling attainment before attainment is overweening pride.

By contrast, true arhat stance is:

- know what is not yet ultimate
- trust what is ultimate
- do not inflate partial attainment

That alignment restores Teaching-One, Action-One, Principle-One, and Person-One coherence.

---

### Why This Section Matters

This section prevents spiritual branding from replacing practice reality.

Zhiyi does not deny prior attainments. He denies falsely absolutizing them when One-Vehicle disclosure calls for further opening.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 五清 | Five clears | Five channels cleared of static | Counter-line to five-corruption obstruction |
| 揀偽敦真 | Reject false, urge true | Strip the fake, press the real | Fourth-turn rhetorical function in this chapter |
| 不聞不知 | Not hearing, not knowing | Signal missed, map unread | First disciple-failure mode |
| 增上慢 | Overweening pride | Claiming the encore before the set is done | Second disciple-failure mode |
| 後身 / 究竟 | Final body / ultimate | Last run / true finish line | Terms used to expose premature completion claims |
| 四一 | Four Ones | Four-channel integrity test | Diagnostic grid for real disciple status |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi is asking for honest spiritual bookkeeping. If Buddha updates the instruction and we cling to old partial completion claims, that is pride, not stability. True discipleship means receiving the next true word when it arrives.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Five-clears relation to evil/wholesome poison modes preserved.
- [x] Fourth-turn shift (reject false / urge true) preserved.
- [x] Two-failure structure retained (not hear/know vs hear-without-acceptance).
- [x] Four-Ones diagnostic mapping preserved.
- [x] Premature-attainment critique retained without anti-śrāvaka caricature.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
