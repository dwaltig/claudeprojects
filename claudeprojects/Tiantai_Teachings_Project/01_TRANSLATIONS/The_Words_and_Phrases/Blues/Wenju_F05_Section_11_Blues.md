### The Setup

Now listen.

After rarity is established, Zhiyi pushes the next demand: faith without naivete.

He does two things at once:

- insist there is no falsehood in the Dharma King's speech
- insist not every audience should be addressed identically in a five-corruptions age

This is trust plus discernment.

---

### First Layer: Do Not Doubt the Trustworthy Person or Dharma

Zhiyi divides the no-falsehood verse into two sub-aims:

1. do not doubt the trustworthy speaker
2. do not doubt the trustworthy Dharma

His reasoning is sharp:

- if even human kings are expected not to self-contradict, how much less the Dharma King
- expedients can be provisional by function, but the revealed real is not false

So doubt here is not critical intelligence. It is mistrusting a verified liberative source.

---

### Old Reading vs Zhiyi's Emphasis

He records an older interpretation that relocates these lines mainly to a "propagate-the-sutra" frame.

Zhiyi does not deny that dimension, but he insists nearby verse lines also directly carry selection-and-exhort-faith force.

In short: this is not merely future mission language; it is immediate reception governance.

---

### Secret-Essential Logic

Zhiyi explains why the One Vehicle was held as "secret essential" for decades:

- not because it was unreal
- because heavy obstruction made premature disclosure harmful or ineffective

Thus secrecy was medicinal timing, not doctrinal concealment by caprice.

---

### Propagation Body: To Whom It Should and Should Not Be Spoken

He makes a difficult but clear line:

- do not preach to unwholesome, untrained hearers who cannot bear/understand
- do preach to wholesome, practice-ready hearers who can receive

This is not elitism. It is damage control and efficacy logic in five-corruptions conditions.

---

### Selecting the Assembly (Six-Line Unit)

Zhiyi reads the six-line portion as:

- three lines: selection/exclusion work
- three lines: exhorting faith

Selection criteria include:

- those delighting in desire-paths (Māra-work trajectories)
- those attached to saṃsāra like earlier those attached to nirvāṇa
- overweening pride types claiming attainment while not seeking Buddha-way

So both saṃsāra-attachment and nirvāṇa-attachment can miss Buddha-discipleship if they block the One-Vehicle intention.

---

### Prediction Thread

He also links a brief prediction strand:

- understanding + no doubt -> prediction can be given
- this becomes a base for later explicit prediction scenes
- propagation commissioning is likewise foreshadowed

So exhort-faith here already seeds downstream narrative architecture.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 11 is where compassion gets procedural:

Believe the true line, but deliver it responsibly.

Truthfulness and audience discernment are not opposites. In Zhiyi, they are one ethics.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 勿有疑 | Do not have doubt | Don’t break the receiver on a verified line | Exhortation against mistrust of Dharma-King speech |
| 法王 | Dharma King | Sovereign of true line delivery | Grounds no-falsehood authority claim |
| 祕要 | Secret essential | Master track held until ears ripen | Timed disclosure of One-Vehicle core |
| 弘經體 | Substance of propagating the sutra | How to carry the teaching in the field | Defines who should or should not receive direct teaching |
| 揀眾敦信 | Select the assembly, press faith | Filter noise, strengthen true reception | Two-part reception governance in five-corruptions age |
| 增上慢 | Overweening pride | False-finish syndrome | Key exclusion marker for non-receiving listeners |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi's exhort-faith unit says this: trust the true speaker, trust the true Dharma, and protect the teaching from misdelivery. Right audience selection is part of compassion, not a betrayal of universality.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] No-falsehood dual focus preserved (trustworthy person + trustworthy Dharma).
- [x] Secret-essential timing logic preserved.
- [x] Propagation-body criteria preserved (do-not-preach / do-preach distinction).
- [x] Six-line selection/exhort split preserved.
- [x] Overweening-pride exclusion logic preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
