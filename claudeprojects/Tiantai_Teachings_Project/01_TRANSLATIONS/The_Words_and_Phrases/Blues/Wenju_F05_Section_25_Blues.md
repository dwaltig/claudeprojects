### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi turns from general map to specific parable detail.

He divides the specific parable into four movements:

1. elder sees fire
2. abandoning desk-plan, using carts
3. equally granting great carts
4. elder not false

---

### Verse Base and Structural Intent

Each movement is tied back to earlier verse units.

So prose expansion is anchored to verse-source discipline.

No free improvisation.

---

### First Movement: "Seeing Fire"

Zhiyi says the first movement has four textual steps but three core intentions:

- seeing subject
- seen condition
- shock/fear-compassion
- expanded seen condition (as explanatory support)

This gives the emotional and doctrinal ignition for the whole specific parable.

### Why This Section Matters

Section 25 is the route card.

It prevents later density from looking chaotic by locking the four-part progression at the start.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 別譬 | Specific parable | Detail-run teaching lane | Expands the general parable into operative steps |
| 長者見火 | Elder sees fire | Compassion sees the blaze | Launch point for rescue pedagogy |
| 捨机用車 | Set aside one plan, use carts | Method pivot for saving lives | Shift from failed direct method to skillful means |
| 等賜大車 | Equal granting of great carts | No child left on small promise | Culmination in equal great-vehicle bestowal |
| 無虛妄 | Not false | No broken Dharma promise | Validates pedagogical integrity |
| 文四意三 | Four textual units, three core intentions | Textual spread, doctrinal core | Hermeneutic compression principle |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi starts the specific parable with hard structure: compassion must be precise to be believable.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Four-part specific-parable macro map preserved.
- [x] Verse-base linkage preserved.
- [x] First movement's four-text/three-intent logic preserved.
- [x] Witness continuity acknowledged (`[5] 不分卷【甲】`).
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
