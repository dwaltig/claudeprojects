### The Setup

Now listen.

Fascicle Seven opens with heading and attribution lines,
plus witness notes that stabilize roll-title and author-mark transmission.

---

### Why This Opening Matters

This is a seam-control unit:

- marks entry to Fascicle Seven Upper
- secures heading variants in apparatus
- preserves attribution continuity at the new roll start

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 01 provides the deterministic handoff from F06 close into F07 opening.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves the mapped B01 witness set:

- `[8] ...卷第七上`
- `[9] ... heading variant note`
- `[10] ... attribution witness`

### The Lesson

A clean beginning keeps the next fascicle readable, auditable, and true to the line.
