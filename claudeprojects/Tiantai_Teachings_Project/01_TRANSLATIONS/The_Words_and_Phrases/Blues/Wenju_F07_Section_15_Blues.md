### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi opens 授記品 by defining "bestowal of prophecy" and immediately staging objections from other scriptures.

Then he resolves them through two truths and multi-type taxonomy:

- worldly truth: prophecy functions
- first principle: no fixed substantial recipient
- pedagogically: prophecy is still to be given where vow, capacity, and timing converge

---

### Taxonomy Function

The section builds a wide matrix:

- general vs specific prophecy
- proper-cause vs condition-cause vs revealing-cause prophecy
- fast vs delayed forms
- Buddha-bestowed and Bodhisattva-bestowed modes

Lotus then expands scope beyond earlier exclusions.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B15 apparatus continuity:

- `[4] 後說【大】，說後【甲】`
- `[5] 大【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[6] 莂【大】，別【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 15 establishes prophecy as a calibrated liberative instrument, not a sentimental reward.

It also frames why Lotus-style bestowal can include classes often excluded elsewhere.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 授記 | Bestowing prophecy | Future-certification line | Confirms eventual fruition under right conditions |
| 受決 / 受莂 | Receiving determination / distinct bestowal | Confirmed future assignment | Clarifies decisional and differentiating aspects |
| 世諦 / 第一義 | Worldly truth / first principle | Functional level / ultimate level | Prevents reification while preserving practice utility |
| 正因 / 緣因 / 了因記 | Proper/conditional/revealing cause prophecy | Cause-type prophecy matrix | Distinguishes doctrinal mechanisms of bestowal |
| 通途記 / 別與記 | General-path / specifically-given prophecy | Broad issuance / targeted issuance | Organizes scope and context |
| 圓因已足 | Perfect cause complete | Cause-line maturity threshold | Grounds why prophecy is now timely |

---

### The Lesson

Prophecy in Lotus is not flattery.
It is precise timing of a truth the line can now bear.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] F07-B15 prophecy-opening architecture preserved.
- [x] Two-truth framing preserved.
- [x] Multi-type prophecy taxonomy preserved.
- [x] Witnesses `[4]/[5]/[6]` preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
