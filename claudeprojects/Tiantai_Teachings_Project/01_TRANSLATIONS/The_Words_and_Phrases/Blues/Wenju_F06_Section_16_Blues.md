### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi turns from rejecting unstable models to establishing how the chapter should actually be entered:

through narrator framing and reception sequence.

---

### Narrator Function

The narrator does not only report events.

The narrator stabilizes:

- who has heard what
- where understanding has and has not emerged
- how the chapter's internal voice should be trusted

---

### Prose-First Utility

Zhiyi places prose opening logic before expansive parable unpacking.

That ordering keeps doctrinal claims and affective responses aligned.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 16 sets the narrative discipline that prevents a purely abstract reading of 信解.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves:

- `[13] 自陳【大】，陳自【甲】`
- `[14] 云【大】，言【甲】`

### The Lesson

Zhiyi makes sure we enter 信解 through an accountable voice structure, not through free-floating doctrine.

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] B16 narrator/prose opening preserved.
- [x] Prose-first reception-order logic preserved.
- [x] Witnesses `[13]/[14]` preserved.
- [x] No spill into B17 long-prose architecture block.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
