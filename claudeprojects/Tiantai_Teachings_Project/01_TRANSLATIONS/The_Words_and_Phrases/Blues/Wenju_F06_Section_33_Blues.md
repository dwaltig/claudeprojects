### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi aligns this pursuit unit with the earlier fire-house pattern:

- first invite-path
- then warning-path
- both fail under current capacity
- strategic release follows

---

### Double No-Reception

The child does not receive invitation language.

Then does not receive warning language.

Forcing further would damage the root.

So release is protective wisdom, not abandonment.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 33 is the operational link between fire-house rescue theory and father-son recovery praxis.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves:

- `[3] 與【大】，豫【甲】`
- `[4] 雖【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[1] 者【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[2] 除【大】，除其【甲】`
- `[3] 本【大】，大【甲】`

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 追誘 | Pursuit and inducement | Chase-and-guide method | Applied skillful means phase |
| 勸門 / 誡門 | Invite path / warning path | Soft call / sharp caution | Two pedagogical tracks |
| 無機 | No receptive capacity | Not receivable now | Explains failure of both tracks |
| 放捨 | Strategic release | Pause to protect the root | Compassionate de-escalation |
| 勿強將來 | Do not force bringing back | No coercive overreach | Explicit no-harm instruction |
| 冷水灑面 | Cool water to the face | Sobering small-door reset | Re-entry through manageable method |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi's compassion refuses coercion when coercion would destroy future possibility.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] B33 invite/warning double-path preserved.
- [x] Double no-reception preserved.
