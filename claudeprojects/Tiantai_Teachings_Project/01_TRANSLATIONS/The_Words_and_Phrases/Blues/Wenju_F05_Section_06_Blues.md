### The Setup

Now listen.

Section 5 paused forceful Great-mode speech.

Section 6 begins the positive turn: not silence, but skillful redirection.

Zhiyi frames it through one key line: inside the One Buddha Vehicle, expediently speak three.

---

### The Main Structural Layout

Zhiyi divides this unit as:

- eleven lines total
- ten lines: how transformation actually succeeds
- one line: resolving the resulting doubt

Inside the ten lines he maps four movements:

1. one line: fit the Three Vehicles to conditions
2. six-and-a-half lines: identify workable small-capacity
3. one-and-a-half lines: apply the teaching
4. one line: acceptance/practice enters

So this is not random compromise. It is staged efficacy.

---

### What "Seeking/Thinking of Past Buddhas" Really Means

Zhiyi explains "seeking/thinking" with precision:

Beings may lack Great-capacity now, but they are never to be abandoned forever.

So Buddha recalls and aligns with the Buddhas' own method:

- adapt Dharma
- match capacity
- rescue through expedients

This is continuity with Buddha-lineage, not innovation under panic.

---

### Why the Buddhas Praise This Move

Zhiyi notes a contrast:

- earlier Great-only attempt with no capacity -> no praise
- now small-vehicle entry fitted to roots/conditions -> praise

Because this path can carry beings from start to finish.

The praise logic has five beats (appearance, direct commendation, shared method, twofold explanation, concluding line):

Even when speaking three, the end-goal remains manifesting the real.

---

### Conceal Real / Use Provisional: Not Deception, But Guidance

Zhiyi's formula:

- attain unsurpassed true wisdom
- then use expedient power in accord with all Buddhas
- conceal real / set provisional for those with small appetite and limited bearing

He calls this "foremost guide" work:

for the sake of One, dispense Three, then lead into Buddha wisdom.

---

### Śākyamuni's "Namo" Response

After hearing Buddhas' praise, Śākyamuni responds "Namo" (reverent compliance).

Zhiyi interprets this in two movements:

- voiced assent
- inward assent to beings' actual capacities

So reverence here is active alignment with liberative fit, not ceremonial formality.

---

### The Teaching Core: Unspeakable Real, Speakable Expedient

Zhiyi states a difficult paradox cleanly:

- marks of quiescent extinction cannot be fully captured by language
- yet by expedients, teachings are cast as three vehicles, birth/death frames, and gate-based explanations

This is language used medicinally, not metaphysics reduced to slogans.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 6 is the first full demonstration that "pause" in Section 5 was constructive, not empty.

Great was paused to prevent harm; now Three is activated to create real entry.

That is compassionate engineering: same destination, changed ramp.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 尋念過去佛 | Seeking/thinking of past Buddhas | Check the elder liner notes before the next move | Aligns current pedagogy with Buddha-lineage method |
| 於一佛乘方便說三 | Within One Buddha Vehicle, expediently speak three | One destination, three entry lanes | Core architectural principle of this section |
| 隱實設權 | Conceal real, set provisional | Keep master tape covered while ears warm up | Adaptive disclosure under readiness limits |
| 第一導師 | Foremost guide | Lead engineer of liberation route | Title for method that truly carries beings through |
| 南無 | Reverent compliance | Yes to the right method at the right time | Marks Śākyamuni's assent to capacity-fit pedagogy |
| 受行悟入 | Accept, practice, realize, enter | Receive, run, wake, step through | Completion sequence after expedient teaching is given |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi shows that not abandoning beings means never confusing "highest" with "immediate." The Buddha who truly saves is the Buddha who can translate the unspeakable into workable entry without losing the One.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Eleven-line macro structure preserved (10 + 1).
- [x] Four-part internal movement preserved (fit, capacity, apply, receive/practice).
- [x] "Seeking/thinking" rendered as non-abandonment lineage-alignment.
- [x] Buddhas' praise logic preserved as efficacy-based.
- [x] Unspeakable-real / expediently-spoken paradox retained.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
