### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi states the long prose has two major layers:

1. brief dharma explanation
2. brief parable pointer

Inside the first, he marks the earlier non-seeking stance as a threefold header.

---

### Threefold Non-Seeking Header

The chapter reports three reasons for not seeking the greater path previously.

Zhiyi treats these as structural, not incidental emotion:

- role-position constraints
- age/ability framing
- attainment-position attachment

These become the baseline that later gets overturned.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 17 gives the skeleton of the long-prose entry so later explanatory detail can be placed correctly.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 長行又二 | Long prose in two parts | Two-lane prose frame | Primary architecture statement |
| 略法說 | Brief dharma statement | Compressed doctrinal declaration | First long-prose lane |
| 略舉譬 | Briefly raise parable | Parable preview cue | Second long-prose lane |
| 三不求 | Three non-seekings | Triple withholding rationale | Header for prior stance |
| 無所依求 | No basis for seeking | Stalled aspiration condition | Signals locked earlier posture |
| 架構先立 | Establish structure first | Build frame before detail | Zhiyi's compositional method |

---

### The Lesson

Before proving transformation, Zhiyi first names the exact structure of prior non-seeking.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] B17 two-part long-prose architecture preserved.
- [x] Threefold non-seeking header preserved.
- [x] Structural (not merely affective) reading preserved.
- [x] No apparatus expected in this block (none added).
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
