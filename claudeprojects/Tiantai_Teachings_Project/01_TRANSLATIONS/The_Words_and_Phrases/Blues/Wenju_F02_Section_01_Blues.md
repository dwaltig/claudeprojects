Now listen.

The first three Arhats in this section share something: **residual habits**. They're fully awakened — the defilements are gone — but the *traces* remain. Like an amp that buzzes even when no one's playing. Like a guitarist who still taps his foot to a tempo from a song he finished years ago.

Awakening doesn't mean perfection. It means freedom. And freedom includes the freedom to carry quirks.

## Gavāmpati (憍梵波提): Cow Rumination

### The Name

> "Gavāmpati (憍梵波提): Translated as 'Cow Ruminate.' For five hundred lifetimes he was an ox king. After eating, an ox constantly engages in empty chewing. Because his residual retribution was not yet extinguished, he made a chewing sound constantly. Contemporaries called him 'Cow Ruminate.'"

Five hundred lives as an ox. That's not a slip. That's karma. And even after full awakening, the habit persisted — the mouth kept moving.

### The Biography

Gavāmpati had a merit-history with geese:

> "In the past, among five hundred wild geese, one goose always obtained flowers and fruits to offer to the Goose King."

That merit ripened. When the Buddha and 500 bhikṣus survived on horse-fodder during a famine, Gavāmpati was in the heavens, being fed by the deva-king. He earned it.

But here's the catch: he stayed in heaven because humans ridiculed his chewing. The *Ekottara Āgama* says:

> "Among those who delight in being in the heavens and do not delight in the human world, Gavāmpati is foremost."

The devas knew his virtue. Humans saw only the quirk.

### The Four Siddhāntas

| Siddhānta | Application |
|-----------|-------------|
| Worldly | He delights in the heavens — following preference |
| Individual | Fed by the Goose King merit — karmic reward |
| Therapeutic | Avoiding human ridicule — protecting beings from sin |
| Ultimate | The devas don't ridicule — recognizing true worth |

### The Four Teachings

| Teaching | Good and Evil in Gavāmpati |
|----------|---------------------------|
| Tripiṭaka | Dwelling in heaven = good; cow-chewing = evil |
| Shared | Attaining the Way with a cow-chewing body = evil is not inherently evil; chewing in a heavenly garden = good is not inherently good |
| Distinct | The good and evil of both mundane and supramundane realms |
| Perfect | Demonstrating the **Reality Mark** of good and evil — neither fixed |

### Fundamental and Trace

- **Fundamental**: He abides in the Four Fearlessnesses, peacefully dwelling as a Noble Lord like the Ox King in the Heaven of Ultimate Truth.
- **Trace**: He manifests cow-ruminating and delights in the [literal] heavens.

### Contemplating the Mind

> "Contemplating the principle of the Middle Way of the mind-nature; walking peacefully and uprightly yet with speed like the wind — this is the **Ox King Contemplation**."

Steady, grounded, patient. No rush. Like an ox plowing a field. That's the mind-practice Gavāmpati teaches.

## Revata (離婆多): Constellation — "Whose Body Is This?"

### The Name

> "Revata (離婆多): Translated as 'Constellation,' or 'False Union.' His parents prayed to the stars for a child. Since they obtained him through this response, they named him after the star."

But there's a deeper story — the story of the ghosts:

### The Ghost Story

> "Someone cites the *Dazhilun*: Spending the night in an empty pavilion, he saw two ghosts fighting over a corpse. They asked him to judge whose it was. Whether he lied or told the truth, he could not avoid harm, so he answered according to the facts. The big ghost ripped off his hands and feet; the small ghost patched him with limbs from the corpse. When they finished eating his original limbs, they wiped their mouths and left."

Now Revata was rebuilt from borrowed parts. He didn't know whose body he had.

> "Doubting and hesitating, whenever he met someone he would ask: 'Do you see my body or not?' Thus it is said he 'Constantly Made Sound.'"

He couldn't stop asking the question. Is this me? Is this mine?

### The Liberation

> "The multitude of monks said: 'This person is easily liberated.' They told him: 'Your body was originally the remnants of another; it is not your own possession.' He immediately attained the Way."

That's the teaching of non-self, handed to him on a platter. He wasn't studying the doctrine. He was *living* it.

The *Ekottara Āgama* says:

> "Among those who sit in meditation entering samādhi with a mind not inverted or scattered, Revata is foremost."

No inversion. No scattering. He found stillness in the question that should have driven him mad.

### The Four Teachings

| Teaching | Interpretation of "Not Mine" |
|----------|------------------------------|
| Tripiṭaka | Analytically destroying the Five Aggregates as not "my" possession |
| Shared | Embodying the understanding that the aggregates are originally not "mine" |
| Distinct | Discriminating that the aggregates of the Ten Dharma Realms are all not one's own |
| Perfect | Understanding the aggregates are not "mine" nor "another's" — seeing the **Reality Mark of the Aggregates** |

### Fundamental and Trace

- **Fundamental**: Abiding in the Sun, Star, and Constellation Samādhi.
- **Trace**: Manifesting this name and this story.

### Contemplating the Mind

> "Contemplating the mind mindful of the Buddha, seeing the Buddhas of the ten directions as numerous as observing stars at night."

Stars everywhere. Buddhas everywhere. The mind that asks "Whose body is this?" is the mind that sees infinity.

## Pilindavatsa (畢陵伽婆蹉): Residual Arrogance

### The Name

> "Pilindavatsa (畢陵伽婆蹉): Translated as 'Residual Habit.' For five hundred lifetimes he was a Brahmin. His residual arrogance was still high. Crossing the Ganges River, he said: 'Hey! Little Maid, stop the flow!'"

He called the river goddess a *maid*. Full stop.

### The Scandal

The goddess wasn't having it:

> "The River Goddess parted the stream for him. Then the spirit went to complain to the Buddha. The Buddha ordered him to apologize. He immediately joined his palms: 'Little Maid, do not be angry.' The great assembly laughed — apologizing yet scolding again!"

He couldn't stop. The habit was too deep. Five hundred lifetimes of Brahmin superiority.

But the Buddha defended him:

> "The Buddha said: 'His original habit is like this; effectively he has no arrogant mind.'"

The habit was there. The defilement was not. The form of arrogance persisted; the substance was gone.

The *Ekottara Āgama* says:

> "Among those who sit in bitter practice under trees, avoiding neither wind nor rain, Pilindavatsa is foremost."

### The Four Teachings

| Teaching | Interpretation of Pride |
|----------|------------------------|
| Tripiṭaka | Extinguishing pride, realizing no pride |
| Shared | Pride itself is no-pride |
| Distinct | Discriminating the highs and lows of the Ten Dharma Realms |
| Perfect | The Eight Self-Existences — "I" complete with the Buddha-Dharma |

### Fundamental and Trace

- **Fundamental**: Abiding in Eternity, Bliss, Self, and Purity (the Four Virtues) and the Eight Self-Existences; possessing the subtle Brahma voice.
- **Trace**: Manifesting an arrogant mind and rough speech.

### Contemplating the Mind

> "Contemplating that coarse speech and soft words both return to the Ultimate Truth."

The form doesn't matter. The destination does. "Little Maid" and "Homage to the Goddess" — both return to the same place.

---

**The Lesson**: Residual habits are not disqualifications. Gavāmpati chewed; Revata asked; Pilindavatsa insulted. All three were Arhats in good standing. Awakening doesn't erase the grooves in the record — it just means you don't skip anymore.
