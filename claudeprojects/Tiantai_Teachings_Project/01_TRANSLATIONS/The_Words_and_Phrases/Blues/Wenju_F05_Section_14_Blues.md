### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi now slows the camera on reception itself.

He reads Śāriputra's joy in layered ways: worldly, for-the-person, counteractive, and ultimate.

This is not sentimentality. It is a full diagnostic of transformed understanding.

---

### Four-Siddhānta Joy Mapping

He maps joy through four lenses:

1. **worldly**: heart and body harmonize in rejoicing
2. **for-the-person**: shift from small-house poverty to great-house inheritance
3. **counteractive**: worry/regret/doubt obstructions are dissolved
4. **ultimate**: certainty of Buddhahood while abiding in true wisdom

So joy is doctrinally structured, not merely emotional overflow.

---

### Doctrinal Clarification: This Is Not Ordinary Happiness

Zhiyi insists this joy is not gain/loss pleasure.

An arhat beyond coarse reactivity is not rejoicing for worldly reasons.

The joy here belongs to stage-entry and real-line recognition.

---

### Origin-Trace Layer

He adds origin/trace framing:

Śāriputra as long-accomplished in origin, now appearing as trace-assistant to Śākyamuni.

Then he maps flavor-sequence benefits (milk/curd/raw butter/cooked butter/ghee) as compassionate pedagogical rollout toward Buddha knowledge-and-vision.

So the joy sequence is also historical-compassion sequence.

---

### Outer Demeanor as Doctrinal Gesture

"Rise, join palms, face Buddha" is read symbolically:

- former split between provisional and real -> now joined
- cause now truly tending fruit
- gaze with no side-thought -> opening Buddha knowledge-and-vision

Body here is not decorative ritual; body is enacted understanding.

---

### Confession Logic: Fault Returned to Self

Zhiyi highlights Śāriputra's retrospective honesty:

- I was deluded about provisional and real
- this was my confusion, not Buddha partiality

That move matters: gratitude replaces accusation; repentance stabilizes insight.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 14 shows the path through doctrinal shame without collapse:

- name former loss clearly
- refuse blame projection
- receive present gain fully

This is mature conversion, not emotional swing.
