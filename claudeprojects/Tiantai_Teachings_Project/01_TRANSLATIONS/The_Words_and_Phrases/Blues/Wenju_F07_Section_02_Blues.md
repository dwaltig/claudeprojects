### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi opens the chapter by naming the whole field:

- mountains and rivers
- clouds and rain
- grasses and trees

But he titles the unit "Medicinal Herbs" because herb-efficacy does the doctrinal heavy lifting.

---

### Why the Name Locks Here

The naming logic follows function, not scenery.

- land can produce
- cloud-rain can moisten
- all growth has use
- medicinal herbs carry stronger curative force

Then the argument rises:

- leaking good can remove evil
- non-leaking realization is highest
- four great disciples receive praise for deep reception

So "Medicinal Herbs" is not decorative. It is interpretive precision.

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B02 apparatus continuity:

- `[11] 除【大】，治【甲】`
- `[12] 芽【大】，可【甲】`
- `[13] 臟【大】，藏【甲】`
- `[14] 一義【大】，義一【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 02 fixes the naming rule at chapter entry:
title follows salvific efficacy, not broad imagery.

That anchor prevents drift in all later metaphor handling.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 藥草喻品 | Medicinal Herbs Parable Chapter | Healing-track chapter stamp | Declares curative doctrinal center |
| 能生 / 能潤 | Able to produce / able to moisten | Growth-side / rain-side engine | Defines causal roles in the metaphor field |
| 有漏諸善 | Leaking forms of good | Partial remedy virtues | Removes evil but not final disease-root |
| 無漏 | Non-leaking | Leak-free realization line | Marks superior liberation function |
| 四大弟子 | Four great disciples | Primary receivers of the line | Embody deep grasp of Buddha's intent |
| 領解 | Received understanding | Heard-and-held comprehension | Validates parable reception integrity |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi names what heals most deeply.
That keeps the chapter's center on liberation-work, not poetic scenery.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] F07-B02 opening naming chain preserved.
- [x] Efficacy hierarchy (land/cloud-rain/herbs) preserved.
- [x] Leak/non-leak contrast preserved in function.
- [x] Witnesses `[11]/[12]/[13]/[14]` preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
