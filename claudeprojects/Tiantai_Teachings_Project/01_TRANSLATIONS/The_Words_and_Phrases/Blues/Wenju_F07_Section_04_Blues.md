### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi turns to the central prose engine:

- raise the Dharma King to secure trust
- unfold opening-the-provisional and revealing-the-real
- show teaching and wisdom completing each other

---

### Core Architecture

The argument moves in two synchronized tracks:

- according to teaching: opening three, revealing one
- according to wisdom: illuminating provisional and real without obstruction

He then binds them:

- two teachings reveal two wisdoms
- two wisdoms speak two teachings

No split system. Mutual completion.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B04 apparatus continuity:

- `[2] 寱【大】，𭌵【甲】`
- `[3] 深【大】，染【甲】`
- `[4] 歸趣【大】，所趣【甲】`
- `[5] 照此【大】，此照【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 04 is the chapter's control room.

It prevents a shallow split between method and insight by proving they are reciprocal in operation.
