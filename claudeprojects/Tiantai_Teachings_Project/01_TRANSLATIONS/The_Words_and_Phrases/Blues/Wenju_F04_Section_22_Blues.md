### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi finishes this lower-roll architecture by tightening one triad:

1. Buddha-eye sees
2. five-corruption field is seen in six-path detail
3. great compassion rises and enters with expedient method

That is the bridge from doctrinal map to burning-house action.

---

### The Six-Part Verse Board (Broad Summary)

In the forty-one-and-a-half-line broad verse pass, Zhiyi keeps a six-part board:

1. five-corruption context and opening three
2. expedient-transformational deployment
3. revealing the real
4. rarity praise (linked from broader Buddha-section logic)
5. no-falsehood
6. pressing faith

He keeps reminding us: even when order shifts, the operational architecture remains coherent.

### First Four Lines: Why Buddha-Eye Matters

Zhiyi insists on "Buddha-eye" language because this sight is total and capacity-sensitive.

- sharp roots + light obstruction -> one-vehicle direct disclosure can land
- dull roots + heavy obstruction -> expedient forms are applied first

He explains that deva-eye and dharma-eye functions are not denied; rather, Buddha-eye includes and exceeds them. It is integrative sight.

---

### Six-Path Diagnosis as Five-Corruption Readout

He aligns verse phrases with corruption types and then expands six-destiny logic:

- poverty/lack of blessing-wisdom
- perilous birth-death continuity
- deep attachment to five desires
- failure to seek Buddha-force and suffering-cutting dharma
- deep entry into deviant views while trying to abandon suffering by suffering-causes

Then he adds destiny etymologies and karmic profiles (hell, animal, hungry ghost, human, asura, deva) to show that "six paths" is not decorative cosmology; it is practical diagnostic ecology.

---

### Final Half-Line: Compassion Enters

After seeing, compassion must move.

Zhiyi's final turn is clear:

Great compassion perfumes the mind, enters the three realms, establishes expedients, and leads beings toward Buddha wisdom.

Seeing without entry would be sterile. Entry without seeing would be reckless. He insists on both.

---

### Why This Closure Matters

This ending seals the lower roll's core rhythm:

- structural precision
- condition-sensitive pedagogy
- unwavering one-vehicle intent

Buddha does not improvise randomly in suffering-worlds. Buddha reads the field, then acts with measured mercy.

### The Lesson

The lower roll closes with a disciplined vow: see truly, diagnose precisely, teach expediently, and never lose the One-Vehicle destination. That is Zhiyi's compassionate engineering, all the way down.

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Six-part broad verse architecture retained.
- [x] Buddha-eye integrative function preserved.
- [x] Five-corruption / six-path diagnostic linkage preserved.
- [x] Etymological-destiny expansion retained as doctrinally functional, not ornamental.
- [x] Final compassion-entry movement preserved (seeing -> entering -> guiding).
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
