### The Setup

Now listen.

From "譬如" onward, Zhiyi lays out the metaphor engine in two layers:

- difference parable
- non-difference parable

Difference names varied capacities.
Non-difference names one ground, one rain, one final destination.

---

### Sixfold Difference Sequence

The differential stream is organized as six:

- land
- plants/trees
- dense cloud
- pouring rain
- receiving moisture
- growth increase

Then the non-difference seal clarifies that all these streams return to one field.

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B05 apparatus continuity:

- `[1] 譬【大】，譬說【甲】`
- `[2] 植【大】，殖【甲】`
- `[3] 蔭【大】，陰【甲】`
- `[4] 聲【大】，震【甲】`
- `[5] 下【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[6] 辯【大】，辨【甲】`
- `[7] 注法【大】，法注【甲】`

### Why This Section Matters

Section 05 gives the mechanical blueprint for the entire herb-rain teaching:
plural forms of growth, singular source of nourishment.

Without this architecture, later matching passages lose doctrinal precision.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 差別譬 | Difference parable | Capacity-graded imagery line | Explains varied reception profiles |
| 無差別譬 | Non-difference parable | Equal rain field | Protects one-flavor Dharma equality |
| 一地一雨 | One ground, one rain | Single-source nourishment | Unifies differentiated outcomes |
| 三草二木 | Three grasses, two trees | Multi-tier growth ensemble | Encodes graded capacities without severance |
| 普載普潤 | Universally carrying and moistening | No-one-left-dry rain rule | Signals impartial Buddha benefit |
| 途轍不同 | Tracks differ | Distinct travel lanes | Allows provisional plurality inside one return |

---

### The Lesson

Difference is real in appearance.
Non-difference is real at root.
Zhiyi makes us hold both without tearing the line.

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] F07-B05 difference/non-difference opening preserved.
- [x] Sixfold differential parable sequence preserved.
- [x] One-ground/one-rain equalizing logic preserved.
- [x] Witnesses `[1]/[2]/[3]/[4]/[5]/[6]/[7]` preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
