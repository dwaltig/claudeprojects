### The Setup

Now listen.

The question asks what "after a short while" means.

Zhiyi answers with two timing readings:

- near-term reflective maturation after prior teaching
- another explicit doctrinal timing window tied to later discourse context

---

### Function of the Q&A

This is a timing control device.

It prevents vague chronology and secures when great-capacity aspiration becomes active.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 39 protects narrative precision: maturation has a when, not just a what.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves:

- `[3] 去【大】，去般若【甲】`
- `[4] 是【大】，此【甲】`

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 少時 | Short while | Maturation interval marker | Clarifies timing of capacity shift |
| 尋思所領 | Reflect on what was received | Internal digestion phase | Prepares great-capacity rise |
| 大乘機發 | Great-vehicle capacity activation | Big-line ignition point | Transition from holding to seeking |
| 漸已通泰 | Gradually became open and settled | Deepening readiness curve | Psychological timing indicator |
| 成就大志 | Great intention accomplished | Aspiration stabilization | Threshold for transfer stage |
| 問答定時 | Q&A timing settlement | Chronology lock | Guards against loose sequencing |

### The Lesson

Zhiyi gives awakening-process a clock, not just a slogan.

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] B39 Q/A polarity preserved.
- [x] Dual timing reading preserved.
- [x] Capacity-activation timing function preserved.
