### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi expands "child sees father" through four steps:

1. cause of seeing
2. place of seeing
3. form seen
4. fear-and-avoid response

---

### Door-Side Logic

He interprets "standing at the side of the gate" as small-capacity partial seeing,
while "seeing from afar" marks great-capacity stirrings.

Both can coexist in one encounter: dual-capacity contact.

---

### Form and Retinue Symbolics

He maps throne, ornaments, attendants, banners, and ceremonial abundance
as compassion-display and dharma-administration symbolism,
not mere court spectacle.

This includes strong She-body continuity logic.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 30 supplies the visual grammar for why the child fears and why the father adapts.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves:

- `[5] 緣【大】，緣大【甲】`
- `[6] 尊特【大】，特尊【甲】`
- `[7] 云【大】＊，言【甲】＊`
- `[8] 者【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[9] 法【大】，法身【甲】`

Zhiyi reads the scene as precision staging: one father, two capacities, one adaptive compassion.
