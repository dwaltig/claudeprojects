# BLUES GLOSSARY: Fáhuá Wénjù (T.1718) — The Liner Notes Edition

This glossary maps Tiantai technical terminology to Blues vernacular equivalents used in the Wenju Blues adaptation. Terms are locked once established — any changes require explicit revision.

**Root Metaphor**: THE LINER NOTES — The Lotus Sutra is the Album; Zhiyi writes the definitive listening guide.
