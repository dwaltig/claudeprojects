### The Setup

Now listen.

Question:

if the chapter earlier says entry into truth is obtained, why here still call it "seeming"?

Answer:

different narrative moments are being referenced.

No contradiction.

---

### Combined-Parable Compression

Zhiyi then condenses the full chain:

- father-son meeting
- pursuit-inducement
- entrusted-household
- transfer and joy

He tracks where each earlier unit is being "combined" in this passage.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 42 is a high-value reconciliation node.

It prevents false contradictions from fragmenting the whole chapter.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves:

- `[2] 棄【大】，縱【甲】`
- `[3] 力說【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[4] 付【大】，付與【甲】`
- `[5] 下【大】，〔－〕【甲】`

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 那言似 | Why call it seeming here | Apparent inconsistency point | Opens reconciliation question |
| 子開悟時 | Time of child awakening | Awakening-moment reference | Distinguishes temporal frame |
| 合父子相見/追誘/付家業 | Combined meeting/chase/entrustment | Full-chain compression | Integrates major prior units |
| 棄捨不分別 | Set aside and not differentiate | Temporary non-allocation language | Stage-specific limitation marker |
| 方便力 | Power of expedient means | Adaptive speech engine | Explains staged expression |
| 今證昔權 | Present verifies former expedient | Later clarity resolves earlier form | Reconciliation principle |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi reconciles by framing time and function correctly, not by forcing sameness across unequal moments.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] B42 Q/A polarity preserved.
