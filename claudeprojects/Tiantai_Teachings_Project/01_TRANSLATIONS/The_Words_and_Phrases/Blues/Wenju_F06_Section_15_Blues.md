### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi pushes the critique further:

if one calls earlier movements merely "initial" and later movements "final" in the wrong order,
then middle-root awakening sequence becomes contradictory.

---

### Core Critique Move

He tests consistency across stages:

- if this is truly final, what work remains later?
- if later still resolves what was unresolved, earlier "final" was not final

This is a sequence-validity audit, not style preference.

### Why This Section Matters

Section 15 continues the logic-clearing operation so the chapter can proceed on stable ground.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves:

- `[12] 革【大】，隔【甲】`

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 中根次第 | Middle-root sequence | Mid-line awakening order | Tests whether stage assignment is coherent |
| 一往 / 畢竟 | Initial pass / final consummation | First claim / ultimate lock | Main terms under scrutiny |
| 前後相妨 | Prior-later conflict | Timeline self-collision | Signals invalid sequencing |
| 迹義承接 | Trace-level continuity | Surface-line handoff logic | Keeps chapter transition accountable |
| 分位失序 | Stage-order disorder | Wrong placement drift | Error condition in interpretation |
| 邏輯驗證 | Logical verification | Internal stress test | Zhiyi's method for view rejection |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi protects the line by refusing labels that cannot survive their own timeline.

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] B15 continuation-critique preserved.
- [x] Middle-root sequence test preserved.
- [x] Witness `[12]` preserved.
- [x] No spill into B16 narrator/prose apparatus scope.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
