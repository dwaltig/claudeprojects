### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi marks the recap-verses:

- first 73.5 lines: recap prior explanatory body
- last 13 lines: praise Buddha's deep grace

Within the first stretch, he begins with the father-son loss movement.

---

### Recap Method

He shows the recap does not always follow previous order exactly:

some sections are pursued, some are superposed, some are returned to.

Yet architecture remains intact.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 43 opens the recap logic so later verses can be tracked without confusion.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves:

- `[6] 弟【大】，第【甲】`
- `[7] 子【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[8] 相【大】，根相【甲】`
- `[1] 長者【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[2] 踞【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
