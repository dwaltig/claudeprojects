### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi pauses the flow with a hard question:

if great śrāvakas like Kāśyapa and Subhūti still have not openly received full understanding, how can the four assemblies already be described as first awakened?

He answers in two layers, and both are pedagogically deliberate.

---

### The Question Itself

The text asks directly:

- Kāśyapa, Subhūti, and other great voice-hearers are not yet resolved
- so who in the four assemblies is said to have understood first?

This is not contradiction-hunting for sport. It is sequence control.

---

### First Layer of the Answer: The Four Assemblies Also Have Three Grades

Zhiyi says heavenly and human members of the four assemblies are not one flat mass.

They also include:

1. upper-grade roots
2. middle-grade roots
3. lower-grade roots

Upper-grade members can align with Śāriputra's quick-entry profile.

So "first awakened" is internally graded, not universally simultaneous.

---

### Second Layer of the Answer: Provisional Performance by Senior Disciples

Zhiyi then deepens it:

- Śāriputra and Kāśyapa are both provisional-function figures
- middle/lower roots have not yet fully opened
- therefore Kāśyapa and Pūrṇa can be shown "as if not yet understanding"

Why?

To keep the teaching field open for those still in process.

This is staged compassion, not doctrinal delay.

---

### The Vimalakīrti Rule

Zhiyi cites the Vimalakīrti principle:

"When beings are not yet healed, bodhisattvas are not yet healed."

Meaning:

realization is not treated as private completion cut off from others.

The awakened one bends with the assembly's condition.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 17 protects narrative coherence and compassion coherence at once.

It explains why advanced disciples may appear to wait:

not because truth is absent, but because instruction is being timed for the many.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 四眾 | Four assemblies | Whole session room | Collective audience field, not one-level capacity |
| 三品 | Three grades | Three-depth listening tiers | Explains differential reception timing |
| 權行 | Provisional functioning | Compassion role-play line | Senior disciples can model incompletion for others' sake |
| 未開 | Not yet opened | Still-latched hearing | Marks middle/lower roots not yet fully unlocked |
| 眾生未愈，菩薩亦未愈 | Beings unhealed, bodhisattva unhealed | No one leaves the room alone | Compassion binds realization to communal healing |
| 示同不解 | Showing sameness in non-understanding | Standing with the struggling line | Didactic solidarity, not actual ignorance |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi refuses a solitary enlightenment story. The line keeps moving until the room can move.

---
