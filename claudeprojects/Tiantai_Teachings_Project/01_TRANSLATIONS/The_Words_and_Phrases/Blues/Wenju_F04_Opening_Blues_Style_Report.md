# Blues Tone Check — Wenju F04 Opening (Pilot)

## 1. Header Summary
- **Task status:** Pass (pilot started; ready to continue section-by-section)
- **Vibration Score:** 8/10
- **Moan Severity:** GOSPEL

## 2. Annotated Draft

- Original: "From ... onward, [the text] extensively clarifies opening the three and revealing the one."
  - Annotated: "From this point onward, the text keeps working the same hard line: open the three, reveal the one.{RHYTHM: break into two short beats for spoken cadence}{LEXICON: 'keeps working the same hard line' adds endurance register without doctrinal drift}"

- Original: "The text is divided into three [sections]."
  - Annotated: "The teaching turns three faces, but it stays one teaching.{RHYTHM: call-and-response cadence}{LEXICON: preserves threefold structure while strengthening testimony tone}"

- Original: "Now, using Ten Meanings, we analyze and distinguish."
  - Annotated: "Now Zhiyi lays down ten meanings like switches on the board, so nothing gets read flat.{RHYTHM: concrete image; one long, one short clause}{LEXICON: 'switches on the board' fits liner-notes world and keeps analytic force}"

- Original: "If one says there are definitely no [voice-hearers], who enters the Magic City?"
  - Annotated: "If you say there are none at all, then who walks into the phantom city?{RHYTHM: direct second-person challenge voice}{LEXICON: keep technical term 'phantom city' intact}"

- Original: "If one views from the elder's real wisdom, there is no hired servant; if one goes by the poor son's root-capacity, then he himself claims to be a hired servant."
  - Annotated: "From the elder's real wisdom, no hired laborer stands there; from the poor son's own capacity, he still names himself a hired laborer.{RHYTHM: balanced A/B parallelism kept intact}{LEXICON: no doctrinal substitution; preserve standpoint logic exactly}"

## 3. Suggested Rewrites

| Original | Blues-heavy rewrite |
| :--- | :--- |
| "From ... onward ... opening the three and revealing the one." | "From here on, the track keeps one burden: open the three, reveal the one." |
| "The text is [divided into] three." | "One teaching, three turns, each meeting a different root." |
| "Using Ten Meanings, we analyze and distinguish." | "Zhiyi sets ten meanings on the table so every move can be tested, not guessed." |
| "If there are definitely no [voice-hearers], who enters the Magic City?" | "If none are there at all, then who steps into the phantom city, and what is the provisional leading?" |
| "Do not cling one-sidedly to existence or non-existence." | "Do not grab one side and call it final: not 'only there,' not 'only absent.'" |

## 4. Notes
- The pilot keeps all doctrinal pivots in place: three-turn architecture, ten-meaning diagnostic grid, and the existence/non-existence dialectic.
- Risk line: replacing "Magic City" with any new metaphor would blur Lotus-specific reference; retained as "phantom city".
- Risk line: turning the elder/poor-son sentence into pure metaphor could collapse standpoint logic; kept literal enough to preserve argumentative force.
