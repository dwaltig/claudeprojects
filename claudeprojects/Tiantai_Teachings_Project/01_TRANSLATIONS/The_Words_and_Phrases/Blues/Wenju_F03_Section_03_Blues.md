### Concluding and Opening (Fourth Part: 1.5 Lines)

From "Manjushri, I abide/see" onward — just one and a half lines — Maitreya wraps up what came before and opens what comes next. "Seeing and hearing like this" concludes the previous section. "Thus vast and many" opens the floodgates for the big question: what are those bodhisattvas *doing* out there in those other worlds?

### The Big Question: Thirty-One and a Half Lines on Bodhisattva Practice

From "I see that land" onward, Maitreya pours out thirty-one and a half lines asking about the various practices cultivated by bodhisattvas in those other lands. This is the longest single block of questioning in the whole section.

Zhiyi breaks it into three:

1. **One line** — General Questioning (a sweeping look)
2. **Fifteen lines** — Sequential Questioning (the Six Paramitas in order)
3. **Fifteen and a half lines** — Mixed Questioning (the Six Paramitas jumbled up)

The General Question is self-explanatory. The real action starts with the Sequential Questioning.

### Sequential Questioning: The Six Paramitas in Order

From "Some perform giving" onward, fifteen lines walk through the Six Paramitas — the six perfections a bodhisattva cultivates — one by one. Zhiyi maps six sections:

1. **Six lines** — ask about **Dana** (Giving / 檀)
2. **Two lines** — ask about **Sila** (Precepts / 尸)
3. **One line** — asks about **Ksanti** (Patience / 忍)
4. **One line** — asks about **Virya** (Exertion / 進)
5. **Two lines** — ask about **Dhyana** (Meditation / 禪)
6. **Three lines** — ask about **Prajna** (Wisdom / 慧)

#### 1. Giving: Three Kinds

Zhiyi reads the giving section as containing three meanings:

- **Four lines** — Giving Wealth: "Jewels and slaves — both noble and base can perform this giving. Four-horse chariots — only the heroic and wealthy give these." Everybody can drop some coins in the plate. But the big-ticket stuff? That takes a different kind of heart.

- **One line** — Giving the Body: "Wife and children are the External Body. Body and flesh are the Internal Body." This is giving what's closest to you — not your possessions, but your *people* and then your own skin.

- **One line** — Giving Life: "Giving head and eyes is Giving Life." The ultimate sacrifice. Everything you are.

And why doesn't the sutra mention **Dharma Giving** — giving the teaching itself? Zhiyi says: it defers to Prajna later. And besides — when you give body, life, and wealth all the way to the edge of birth-and-death and obtain the Indestructible Abiding, *that is* Dharma Giving. It doesn't need a separate mention. It's already there inside the other three.

#### 2. Precepts: One Line, Big Lesson

Two lines on Sila, discussed in terms of bhiksus (monks). Zhiyi makes a sharp observation: "For laypeople, giving is easy but precepts are hard. For monastics, giving is hard but precepts are easy." Think about that. Different situations, different challenges. The precepts section cites the *Sutra of Five Kings*.

#### 3. Patience: Three Kinds

One line on Ksanti. But one line holds three kinds of patience:

- **Life Patience** (生忍): Enduring evil people and evil beasts in quiet forests and deep valleys without anger. You're out in the woods. The wolves come. The cruel ones come. And you don't flinch.

- **Ascetic Patience** (苦行忍): Self-regulation and guarding the will. This is discipline — "Acting as bhiksus."

- **First Principle Patience** (第一義忍): Seeking the Buddha Way. This is the deepest one — "Delighting in reciting sutras." Not enduring the world, but enduring the *truth*, which is harder than any wolf.

#### 4. Exertion: One Line, Deep Mountains

One line on Virya. "Deep mountains are fearful; they are not places for the lazy or timid." The courageous one can be at peace there, as if no one else exists, "thinking and cultivating the True Mark thought after thought, unceasingly, advancing to seek the Buddha Way." That's exertion — not effort for a season, but effort that never stops. Every breath, another step.

#### 5. Meditation: Two Levels

Two lines on Dhyana. The first line asks about cultivating **Fundamental Dhyana** — the four jhanas, the basic concentrations. The second line asks about **Out-of-World Highest Dhyana** — the meditation of the Distinct and Perfect Teachings.

Now check this out — Zhiyi gives us a stunning image for the highest meditation: "Quietude and scattering do not obstruct each other. Without arising from Extinction Samadhi, he manifests various dignities." And then: "Like the Asura's Harp — playing without being strummed. Without condition or thought, if there is a response, it takes form."

The Asura's Harp. An instrument that plays itself. No hand touches the strings, but when someone needs the music, the music comes. That's what the highest meditation looks like — you don't *do* it, it *does you*.

And Zhiyi tracks the superknowledges across the Four Teachings: Commoners have only five. The Two Vehicles have six. Distinct Teaching bodhisattvas defer to the Buddha, so they claim only five. But in the Perfect Teaching — from beginning to end — all six are present.

#### 6. Wisdom: Self-Practice and Transforming Others

Three lines on Prajna, split in two:

**Self-Practice** (one line): "Wisdom Deep" means wisdom that exhausts the Root of Principle. "Will Firm" means vows that are vast and great. These are the Two Adornments — wisdom and merit. Together, they make you able to ask and able to hold.

**Transforming Others** (two lines): Zhiyi maps the balance of samadhi and wisdom across different levels:

- Not-Yet-Arrived Dhyana: Wisdom is greater
- Formless Dhyana: Samadhi is greater
- Four Dhyanas: Equal
- The Two Vehicles: More samadhi
- Bodhisattvas: More wisdom
- The Buddha: Equal
- Emptiness Contemplation: More samadhi
- Provisional Contemplation: More wisdom
- Middle Contemplation: Equal

Three rounds of balancing — practice level, vehicle level, contemplation level. Always the same pattern: the highest is always equal. Balance is the mark of completion.

"Immeasurable Similes" refers to the various Loving Tricks — in all teachings, citing immeasurable analogies to help reveal the First Principle.

"Breaking Mara's Army": The Empty View breaks four Maras. The Provisional View sequentially breaks eight Maras. The Middle View — the Perfect Teaching — breaks eight, ten, and *all* Maras at once.

"Beating the Drum": At the First Abode, one accomplishes True Awakening, becoming a Buddha in a hundred worlds, "perfectly beating the Brahma Wheel Dharma Drum." That's the moment the music fills every room in the house.

### Mixed Questioning: The Second Round

Now somebody asks — and this is a real question, not just a structural one:

**Question:** "The Six Paramitas already gather in the ten-thousand practices. Why must one ask again? Isn't it too complicated?"

**Answer:** "The sequential questioning is one route of gradualness. The non-sequential questioning is not fixed to one route. Since the text says 'various marks and appearances,' how could it be only two routes?"

In other words: don't complain about getting the Album in two formats. The first round was the studio version — orderly, track by track. This second round is the live recording — improvised, mixed up, following the energy of the room. Same six perfections, different arrangement. And together they pattern the other land's full teaching cycle: first the Tripitaka, then the Vaipulya and the twelve divisions of scripture.

The Mixed Questioning has **seven meanings**:

1. **Two lines** — Dhyana again, split into Self-Practice ("Entering Renunciation Dhyana") and Transforming Others ("Entering Compassion Dhyana" — bodhisattvas entering samadhi and emitting light)

2. **One line** — Virya: "Buddha Sons never sleeping" — the *Pratyutpanna* Buddha-Recitation practice, walking and chanting without rest

3. **One line** — Sila: "Dignity without lack" is the initial Non-Lacking Precept. "Pure like precious pearls" is the tenth Ultimate Precept. The beginning and the end of the precept path, with everything between implied.

4. **One and a half lines** — Ksanti: The Two Patiences of Life and Dharma

5. **Two lines** — Dhyana yet again, but now through the Five Hindrances:
   - "Separating from play and laughter" removes the Cover of Restlessness and Regret
   - "Separating from foolish retinue" removes the Cover of Anger
   - "Near the wise" removes the Cover of Doubt
   - "One-mind removing confusion" removes the Cover of Greed
   - "Gathering thoughts in mountain forests" removes the Cover of Sleep

6. **Five lines** — Dana: Giving the Four Requisites (clothing, food, bedding, medicine)

7. **Three lines** — Prajna, and this is the crown jewel:
   - Line 1: "Speaking the Unspeakable Prajna" — saying what can't be said
   - Line 2: "Observing the Unobservable Prajna" — seeing what can't be seen
   - Line 3: "The Path of Words cut off, the place of Mind's Action extinguished" — discussing Prajna by speaking the unspeakable and observing the unobservable

And Zhiyi reads these three rounds of Prajna as potentially patterning the Vaipulya teaching — or, alternatively, as patterning the *Great Perfection of Wisdom* (*Dapin*) teaching: "quiescent and non-dual, pure and unattached."

Then comes the Lotus interpretation: "With this wondrous wisdom they seek the unsurpassed path." Zhiyi says: "One only sees people cultivating wondrous wisdom; one does not see the wondrous-wisdom seat of the Lotus. If one saw the seat, one would know this is like that — what would there be to doubt? But the assembly sees the people and does not see the seat; therefore the whole assembly doubts and asks."

They can see the practitioners but not the *source* of the practice. They can hear the music but can't find the stage. That's why they're still asking.

And the prose versus the verses? "In the prose, the wording is tight and only raises six meanings. Since the verses are expansive, the revealed meaning is clear and coolly distinct." The studio cut was compressed. The live version breathes.

### The Lesson

The bodhisattvas in those other worlds are doing the same six things every practitioner does — giving, keeping precepts, enduring, striving, meditating, and seeking wisdom. But Zhiyi shows you that each one goes deeper than you think. Giving starts with coins and ends with your life. Patience starts with wolves and ends with truth. Meditation starts with sitting still and ends with the Asura's Harp — an instrument that plays itself. And wisdom? Wisdom ends where all words end and all thoughts go quiet. The Album plays on, but the liner notes have run out of things to say. That's when you know you're getting close.
