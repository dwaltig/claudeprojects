### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi's third elder segment (virtue/work) explodes into a dense doctrinal ladder.

He moves from praise language into full parable mechanics.

---

### Inner and Outer Virtue Split

He distinguishes:

- inner virtues: wisdom strategy, mature roots, broken delusion
- outer virtues: wealth imagery, fields/houses/servants as functional correspondences

The point is not social realism alone.

It is symbolic transfer toward practice and realization structures.

---

### "One Gate" Clarified

Zhiyi refuses simplistic readings:

- if gate is only principle, no passage logic
- if gate is only text, too many hearers but no guaranteed release

So he articulates dual gate logic:

1. house-gate: expedient teaching as exit road from saṃsāra
2. cart-gate: perfect teaching as expression of great-vehicle entry

He keeps both pedagogical sequence and ultimate integration visible.

---

### Burning-House Detail as Doctrinal Anatomy

He maps architecture and decay terms to existential conditions:

- halls, pavilions, walls, columns, beams
- decay, collapse, danger, surrounding fire

Then ties these to six destinies, eight sufferings, five turbidities, four inversions, and body-mind contemplative diagnostics.

This is not decorative catastrophe language. It is precise soteriological anatomy.

---

### Thirty Sons and Capacity Typology

"Sons" are those with inherited relation to Buddha-Dharma capacities.

Zhiyi links them to three-vehicle dispositions and varied maturation states.

Those without that operative capacity remain in the broader "five hundred persons" field.

---

### Witness Cluster Integrity

This unit carries a dense apparatus chain that must remain intact:

- `[1] 統【大】，繞【甲】`
- `[2] 車門【大】，門車【甲】`
- `[3] 頹【大】＊，隤【甲】＊`
- `[＊3-1] 頹【大】＊，隤【甲】＊`
- `[4] 不分卷【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 23 is the doctrinal engine room.

It joins elder-image, gate-theory, body-of-suffering mapping, and capacity taxonomy into one sustained explanatory run.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 內德 / 外德 | Inner virtue / outer virtue | Inside power, outside provision | Distinguishes wisdom/realization from supportive function |
| 宅門 / 車門 | House-gate / cart-gate | Exit gate / great conveyance gate | Two-layer teaching-path logic |
| 所燒之門 | Gate of what is being burned | Burn-zone passageway | Clarifies teaching use inside crisis condition |
| 五濁八苦 | Five turbidities, eight sufferings | Full smoke-and-fire field | Existential danger framework of the parable |
| 三十子 | Thirty sons | Inherited response-capacity line | Names differentiated learner aptitude |
| 觀釋 | Contemplative explanation | Practice-reading of symbols | Turns imagery into contemplative diagnostics |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi makes the parable unbearably concrete and doctrinally exact at once: the house is the condition, the gate is the method, and compassion is the one doing the carrying.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Inner/outer virtue distinction preserved.
- [x] Dual gate logic (house-gate/cart-gate) preserved.
- [x] Burning-house symbolic anatomy preserved.
- [x] Thirty-sons capacity mapping preserved.
- [x] Full apparatus witness cluster preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
