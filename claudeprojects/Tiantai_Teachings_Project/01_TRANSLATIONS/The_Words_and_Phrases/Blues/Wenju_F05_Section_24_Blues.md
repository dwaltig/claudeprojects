### The Setup

Now listen.

This small block is a seam, but not dead space.

It marks:

- end of Fascicle Five Upper
- start of Fascicle Five Lower
- author heading reset (Tiantai Zhiyi)

---

### Why the Seam Matters

Zhiyi's long argument is segmented for transmission integrity.

The seam is a scribal and pedagogical checkpoint:

- preserve doctrinal continuity
- mark physical-roll transition
- keep attribution explicit at re-entry

Without respecting these seam lines, later block boundaries drift.

---

### Narrative Function

Immediately after this seam, the text enters the next distinct parable sub-unit (elder seeing fire).

So this bridge is the handoff joint between two dense explanatory runs.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 24 protects edition hygiene and reading flow.

In source-locked workflows, seam lines are part of meaning-preservation discipline.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 卷第五上 | Fascicle 5 upper | Side A close marker | Marks first-roll closure |
| 卷第五下 | Fascicle 5 lower | Side B open marker | Marks second-roll entry |
| 天台智者大師說 | Spoken by Tiantai Zhiyi | Lineage signature stamp | Reasserts authorial authority at transition |
| 卷橋接 | Fascicle bridge | Roll seam handoff | Structural continuity control |
| 邊界鎖定 | Boundary lock | No-drift checkpoint | Keeps subsequent blocks auditable |
| 續段起點 | Continuation start point | Next movement pickup | Anchors the following parable segment |

---

### The Lesson

Even short colophon lines carry weight: they keep the teaching body stitched when the roll turns.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Upper/lower roll seam preserved.
- [x] Author heading reset preserved.
- [x] Transitional function into next parable unit preserved.
- [x] Boundary-lock discipline preserved.
- [x] No doctrinal content invented beyond seam function.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
