### The Setup

Now listen.

After explaining prior non-seeking, the text turns:

"now before the Buddha we have gained great benefit" and "infinite treasure not sought is now obtained."

This is the hinge from brief doctrine to expanded parable.

---

### Function of the Pivot

This pivot does three things:

- declares present realization gain
- reframes earlier non-seeking as surpassed
- legitimizes the move into story-form for full unpacking

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 19 is the ignition point for the long parable run.

Without this pivot, the parable would feel disconnected from the chapter's stated realization.
