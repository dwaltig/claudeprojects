### The Setup

Now listen.

When Buddha answers, Zhiyi says the structure is threefold:

1. arousal (發起)
2. parable statement
3. exhortation to trust

This block is the first part: arousal.

---

### Arousal Has Two Motions

Zhiyi breaks arousal into:

- **抑** (restraining rebuke)
- **引** (drawing-in encouragement)

Rebuke to stir urgency.

Guidance to keep the listener from collapse.

---

### The Rebuke

Buddha points back:

- earlier teaching on provisional and real already aimed at bodhi
- both routes were declared as entering Buddha-way without abiding nirvāṇa

So clinging to confusion now is inexcusable drowsiness.

Zhiyi reads this as purposeful pressure.

---

### The Lift

After sharp rebuke, Buddha immediately consoles:

- "Now I will use parable to make this clearer"

Zhiyi says this prevents shame-hardening.

Without the lift, severe correction could produce withdrawal.

With the lift, correction becomes entry.

---

### Witness Discipline

The apparatus note in this unit remains active:

- `[2] 是引【大】，引是【甲】`

Word order shifts, but the doctrinal function is stable: this is the guiding reception movement.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 19 shows Buddha pedagogy as dual-force:

truth-pressure plus compassionate catch.

Not soft-only. Not hard-only.

Awakening requires both.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 發起 | Arousal / initiation | Strike the downbeat | Opens the teaching phase with directed force |
| 抑 | Restraining rebuke | Wake-up pressure | Breaks entrenched interpretive sleep |
| 引 | Drawing in | Pull-back-to-center line | Keeps listener inside the Dharma field after rebuke |
| 權實皆入佛道 | Provisional and real both enter Buddha-way | Both lanes feed the same line | Prevents dualistic trapping in former teaching frames |
| 譬喻更明 | Clarify again through parable | Re-say in image form | Compassionate re-delivery for unresolved receivers |
| 安慰 | Consoling reception | Catch before collapse | Guards against despair after strong correction |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi's Buddha does not flatter confusion and does not abandon the confused. He presses, then carries.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Three-part answer architecture preserved.
- [x] Two-part arousal (rebuke/guidance) preserved.
- [x] Rhetorical pivot from sharp reproach to reception preserved.
- [x] Apparatus witness `[2]` function preserved.
- [x] No collapse of rebuke or consolation force.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
