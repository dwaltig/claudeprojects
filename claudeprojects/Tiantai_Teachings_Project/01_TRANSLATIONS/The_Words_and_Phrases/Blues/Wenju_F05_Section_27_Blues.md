### The Setup

Now listen.

This is one of the heaviest logic units in Fascicle 5.

Zhiyi maps the pivot from great-plan non-reception to skillful three-cart activation.

---

### Two Gates, Three Steps Each

He divides method into two gates:

1. encouragement gate
2. warning/treatment gate

Each gate runs three steps:

- proposal
- refusal
- release/letting-go

This mirrors the earlier "planned great teaching / no capacity / temporary cessation" logic.

---

### Body-Hand and Implements

He reads "body-hand strength" as:

- body -> spiritual power / carrying force
- hand -> wisdom / lifting force

"Garment-fold, desk, bench" become graded expressions of Buddha-knowledge, fearlessness, and power-disclosure.

The issue is not deficiency in Dharma, but mismatch in recipient capacity.

---

### Why the First Attempt Fails

Zhiyi details the no-reception condition:

- gate is one but perceived as narrow
- subtle principle/teaching/practice cannot yet be entered
- great-root seeds are weak while lower attachment is strong

So letting go is compassionate realism, not abandonment.

---

### Transition to Three-Cart Strategy

After failed direct rescue, Buddha sets expedient strategy:

- knows prior inclinations
- praises rare carts (encourage, show, certify)
- children respond and move

Zhiyi then reads six progression verbs as path markers:

1. fitting wish (hearing)
2. bravery-sharpness (thinking)
3. mutual pushing (cultivation)
4. competing (for true principle)
5. joint running
6. contending out (completion)

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 27 is the mechanics of adaptive pedagogy under crisis.

When one road is too high for current capacity, compassion changes method without dropping final intent.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 捨机用車 | Set aside desk-plan, use carts | Method switch under pressure | Signals skillful pivot after non-reception |
| 勸門 / 誡門 | Encouragement gate / warning gate | Invite gate / treatment gate | Dual pedagogical strategy |
| 擬宜 / 不受 / 放捨 | Propose / not receive / release | Offer / refusal / reset | Three-step response cycle |
| 身手有力 | Body-hand has strength | Carry-force and lift-force | Symbol of Buddha power and wisdom |
| 衣裓几案 | Garment-fold, desk, bench | Graded Dharma instruments | Tiered explanatory supports for great teaching |

### The Lesson

Zhiyi's compassion is operational: no sentimentality, no rigidity. He changes vehicle form to keep liberation movement alive.

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Full two-gate/three-step architecture preserved.
- [x] Body-hand and implement symbolism preserved.
- [x] No-reception logic preserved with gate narrowing analysis.
- [x] Three-cart pivot sequence preserved.
- [x] Six-verb path progression preserved.
- [x] Witness continuity preserved (`[1] 秖【大】＊，只【甲】＊`; `[1] 設權【大】，權設【甲】`; `[2] 第【大】，〔－〕【甲】`).
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
