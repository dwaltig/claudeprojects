### The Setup

Now listen.

The Q/A asks for clean differentiation:

how do "three vehicles" and "magic city" differ,
if both are expedient structures?

Zhiyi distinguishes function without separating final intent.

---

### Distinction without Schism

The section keeps two lines clear:

- three-vehicle language governs graded path-framing
- magic-city language governs fatigue/rest/restart management

Different operational roles,
one completion horizon.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B32 apparatus continuity:

- `[1] 詮【大】，論【甲】`
- `[2] 秖【大】，只【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 32 prevents category confusion.

When these two expedients are collapsed, both doctrinal pedagogy and practical guidance lose precision.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 三車 | Three vehicles | Graded path schema | Organizes stratified instruction lanes |
| 化城 | Magic city | Rest-and-restart structure | Handles discouragement and retention under strain |
| 分判 | Distinguishing adjudication | Functional differentiation ruling | Prevents mixed-category misreading |
| 同歸 | Return together | Shared completion horizon | Preserves ultimate unity of destination |
| 權門各職 | Expedient gates with distinct roles | Different tools, same vow | Coordinates multi-method pedagogy |
| 不混不離 | Not mixed, not separated | Distinct yet integrated | Formula for non-conflicted doctrinal handling |

### The Lesson

Same teacher, different tools.
Different tools, one homecoming.
