### The Setup

Now listen.

Fascicle 5 now formally turns into the Parable Chapter.

Zhiyi asks first what "parable" is, then why it appears exactly here, and for whom.

His answer is pedagogical precision:

when direct line already awakens upper roots, parable is the compassionate device for middle and lower listeners still carrying unresolved doubt.

---

### General Definition: What "Parable" Means

Zhiyi gives two terms:

- "parable" as comparison
- "illustration" as clarifying instruction

Formula:

entrust this to compare that; use the shallow register to train toward deep realization.

So parable is not decorative story. It is calibrated transfer architecture.

---

### Why It Appears After Earlier Prose-and-Verse Exposition

He says the earlier Buddha-exposition already fully awakened upper sharp roots.

Middle/lower streams remain held in residual confusion.

Because great compassion does not stop, Buddha adds second-order skill:

- move tree to teach wind
- raise fan to point moon

In other words: use accessible relational images to trigger deep recognition where abstract declaration has not yet landed.

---

### Four Comparative Functions Zhiyi Highlights

He maps multiple comparison directions:

1. worldly relational forms (father/sons) -> supramundane teacher/disciple dynamics
2. worldly birth-process analogies -> supramundane awakening generation
3. worldly extinction language -> supramundane release sense
4. worldly non-birth/non-extinction framing -> abiding in true wisdom and Buddha-certainty

Then he seals it: one Buddha-sound can still generate four-siddhānta benefit for middle/lower recipients.

---

### Teaching-Based Extension (Early Setup)

Zhiyi begins the teaching-based read:

- Buddha's original intent is Buddha-Vehicle praise
- because beings cannot bear it, he follows former-Buddha compassion patterns
- he deploys three-cart style instruction at Deer Park and across teaching tiers

So parable chapter is not a doctrinal downgrade. It is the mode by which the original Great intent can still reach blocked hearers.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 12 explains the method shift between Track 2 and Track 3:

same truth line, new delivery form.

Parable is how non-abandonment looks when direct exposition alone does not finish the work.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 譬 / 喻 | Parable / illustration | Compare to carry, image to clarify | Defines parable as a transfer mechanism, not ornament |
| 託此比彼 | Entrust this to compare that | Use this groove to teach that depth | Core comparative method statement |
| 寄淺訓深 | Lodge shallow to instruct deep | Low-door entry into high meaning | Pedagogical principle for middle/lower capacity training |
| 一音說譬 | One sound speaking parable | Single line, many receivable forms | Shows unity of Buddha-intent across different delivery styles |
| 四悉檀益 | Four siddhānta benefits | Four therapeutic gains from one teaching act | Explains why parable can work where direct abstraction stalls |
| 大車譬 | Great cart parable | Full-capacity transport image | Signature vehicle for moving hesitant middle/lower hearers |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi opens the Parable Chapter by removing any illusion that story is secondary. In this phase, story is surgery: it carries the same real line into minds that could not yet hold it in direct form.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] General definition of parable preserved with both term-functions.
- [x] Upper-root already-awakened / middle-lower still-deluded contrast preserved.
- [x] Comparative-function set preserved across birth/extinction/non-birth frames.
- [x] Four-siddhānta efficacy claim preserved.
- [x] Teaching-based setup retained as continuation of original Great intent.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
