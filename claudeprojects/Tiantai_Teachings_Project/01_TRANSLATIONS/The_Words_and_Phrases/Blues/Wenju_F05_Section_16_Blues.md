### The Setup

Now listen.

After Śāriputra's self-report, Buddha narratively confirms it.

Zhiyi calls this the "narrating-accomplishment" section: not just praise, but formal validation of understanding as non-false.

---

### Three-Step Confirmation Pattern

Zhiyi maps three movements:

1. formerly taught the Great
2. midway forgot and took the Small
3. now returned to Great speaking

This mirrors the whole Lotus rhythm in miniature.

---

### Why This Matters for Truth-Status

The point is not biography detail alone.

It proves:

- seeing-Buddha condition was real
- sorrow/regret phase was real
- present awakening is real and not self-delusion

So narrative sequence becomes epistemic confirmation.

---

### Expedient Birth in Buddha-Dharma: Two Pulls

Zhiyi says "born in my Dharma by expedients" carries two pulls:

- former Great transformation now flowering as Great understanding
- provisional small-leading used to rescue from evil trajectories

One phrase holds both high-intent continuity and practical rescue logic.

---

### Midway Forgetting and Present Recovery

He distinguishes:

- forgetting mid-path (abandoning great, practicing small)
- present mistaken finality claims

Then the present "remember original vow" line restores orientation:

first provisional training matures small-good; then real disclosure fulfills great-vow mind.

---

### Prediction Section: Why Give Prediction If Understanding Already Arose?

Zhiyi asks implicitly: if one already knows Buddhahood, why formal prediction?

He gives four reasons:

1. previously two vehicles were not predicted; now they must be
2. middle/lower hearers need encouragement
3. hearers form karmic ties through witnessing prediction
4. original vows are fulfilled

Prediction is thus communal pedagogy, not redundant paperwork.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 16 secures the transition from private certainty to public seal.

That shift is essential for shared transmission, not only personal insight.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 述成段 | Narrating-accomplishment section | Official confirmation pass | Converts self-report into Buddha-validated realization |
| 昔教大 / 中忘小 / 還說大 | Formerly taught great / midway forgot small / return to great | Original line -> detour -> restored line | Miniature Lotus trajectory pattern |
| 生我法中 | Born in my Dharma | Brought into the lineage current | Names transformative inclusion via expedient means |
| 本願 | Original vow | Deep-start commitment line | Recalled to reorient from small fixation to great fulfillment |
| 授記 | Prediction | Public future seal | Encourages, binds community ties, and fulfills vow logic |
| 二乘未記 | Two vehicles not formerly predicted | Previously unsealed track | Historical reason prediction now must be explicit |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi shows that awakening needs both inward recognition and public confirmation. The Buddha's narrated seal protects the line, encourages the assembly, and carries vow-history forward into shared future.
