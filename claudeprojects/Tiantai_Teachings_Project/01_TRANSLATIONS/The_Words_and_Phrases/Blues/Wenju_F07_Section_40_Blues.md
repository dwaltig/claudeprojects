### The Setup

Now listen.

With "佛告" the voice mode shifts to authoritative direct instruction.

Zhiyi presents a trace/fundamental re-narration in tri-structured form,
repositioning prior reception within a deeper continuity frame.

---

### Tri-Structure Function

This segment organizes:

- what appeared at trace level
- what is grounded at fundamental level
- how current disciples' path is read through both

The result is not dualism.
It is layered intelligibility.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B40 apparatus continuity:

- `[2] 頌【大】，頌第四【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 40 is a re-framing command point.

It prevents prophecy reception from being read as isolated event by restoring deep structural context.

|---|---|---|---|
| 佛告 | The Buddha said | Direct-authority voice switch | Marks high-certainty instruction phase |
| 述本迹 | Recounting fundamental and trace | Deep-root / manifest-line framing | Recontextualizes present events in layered time |
| 三段架構 | Three-part architecture | Tri-structure frame | Organizes complex doctrinal restatement |

### The Lesson

The Buddha's "now" can open a deeper "always."
This is how present assurance is tied to timeless root.
