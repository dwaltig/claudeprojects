### The Setup

Now listen.

A chapter transition opens:

"Explaining the Five-Hundred-Disciples Prophecy Chapter."

Zhiyi moves from heading into rationale,
showing why this new recipient scope now comes into focus.

---

### Launch Mechanics

The launch does more than rename a section:

- identifies a new audience cluster
- carries forward prior prophecy logic
- narrows application to this cohort's reception condition

This is a scope shift with continuity, not a disconnected start.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B38 apparatus continuity:

- `[1] 時【大】，〔－〕【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 38 is a chapter-doorway control point.

It ensures the reader recognizes both the new target group and the unbroken doctrinal trajectory.
