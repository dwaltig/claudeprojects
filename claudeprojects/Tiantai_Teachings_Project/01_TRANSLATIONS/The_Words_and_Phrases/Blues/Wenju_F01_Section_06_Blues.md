Now listen.

Now Zhiyi takes his Four Methods — his mixing board — and starts applying them to the actual text. Fascicle 1 doesn't get to the main teaching yet. It stays in the Introduction. But it shows you **how** to read every phrase, starting with the opening formula:

> *Evam mayā śrutam ekasmin samaye bhagavān rājagṛhe viharati sma...*

> "Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha dwelt at Rājagṛha, on Vulture Peak Mountain, together with a great assembly of bhikṣus..."

These are among the most famous words in Buddhist literature. Every sutra opens this way (or something similar). But Zhiyi shows you that even "Thus have I heard" is a teaching — and it sounds different depending on which of the Four Teachings you're listening through.

## Part 1: Two Kinds of Introduction

First, Zhiyi distinguishes:

> "The Introduction has two types: General and Specific. From 'Thus have I heard' to 'sat to one side' is the **General Introduction**. From 'At that time the World Honored One' to the end of the chapter is the **Specific Introduction**."

**General Introduction (通序)** — the formula that applies to all sutras. Every Buddhist scripture has a time, place, audience, and preacher. This is the template.

**Specific Introduction (別序)** — the particular setup for *this* sutra. The light from the Buddha's brow. The question Maitreya asks. The answer Mañjuśrī provides. These are unique to the Lotus.

## Part 2: The Six Elements of the General Introduction

The General Introduction has **six elements** (or five, depending on who's counting):

1. **"Thus" (如是)** — What was heard. The Dharma itself.
2. **"I heard" (我聞)** — Who is recording. Ānanda.
3. **"At one time" (一時)** — When. The moment of teaching.
4. **"The Buddha" (佛)** — The speaker. The source.
5. **"At such a place" (住處)** — Where. Rājagṛha, Vulture Peak.
6. **"With such an assembly" (眾成)** — The witnesses. Bhikṣus, bodhisattvas, devas.

These six guarantee the teaching is authentic. It was heard (不是創作 — not invented). It was heard by Ānanda (an eyewitness). It was heard at a specific time and place (not a dream or vision). It came from the Buddha (not a secondary source).

## Part 3: "Thus (如是)" — The Four Interpretations

Now Zhiyi takes just the first word — "Thus" (如是) — and runs it through all four methods.

### Interpretation 1: Causes and Conditions

> "The Buddhas of the three times all begin their sutras with 'Thus.' The Way of all Buddhas is the same. This is the Worldly Siddhānta."

"Thus" signals that the content is universal — shared by all Buddhas across time. Then:

> "The *Da Zhidu Lun* says: 'Mentioning the time and place causes people to generate faith.' This is the Siddhānta for Each Person."

"Thus" is tailored to inspire trust. Then:

> "Also, it refutes the two words 'A' and 'Ou' of the non-Buddhists, which mean 'Not-Thus' and 'Not-Right.' This is the Counteracting Siddhānta."

Brahmanical texts open with different formulas. "Thus" is a polemical move — distinguishing the Buddhist canon. Then:

> "Also, 'Thus' is a word of faith and compliance. With faith, the principle that is heard is grasped. This is the First Principle Siddhānta."

"Thus" isn't just rhetoric — it points to reality itself.

---

### Interpretation 2: According to Teaching

Now the same word, but through the lens of the Four Teachings:

**Tripiṭaka "Thus":**
> "The Buddha explains that Conventional Truth has words/scripture, while Ultimate Truth has no words. Ānanda transmits the words of the Buddha's Conventional Truth without difference from what the Buddha said, therefore it is named 'Thus.'"

At this level, "Thus" means the words faithfully transmit the conventional teaching.

**Shared Teaching "Thus":**
> "The Buddha explains that Form *is* Emptiness, Emptiness *is* Form. The non-difference of Emptiness and Form is 'Thus.'"

At this level, "Thus" means the teaching itself is empty — there's no gap between signifier and signified.

**Distinct Teaching "Thus":**
> "One exits the side of Birth-and-Death existence and enters the non-existence of Nirvana; one exits the non-existence of Nirvana and enters the Middle Way."

At this level, "Thus" describes a progressive ascent toward the Middle.

**Perfect Teaching "Thus":**
> "Birth-and-Death *is* Nirvana, and also *is* the Middle Way. True Suchness pervades all places — there is nothing that is not the Buddha Dharma. Being immovable in Thusness-Thusness is named 'Thus.'"

At this level, "Thus" means: you're already there. No exit, no entry, no movement. Just this.

Zhiyi summarizes the four:

| Teaching | Movement | Result |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Tripiṭaka | "Move" the conventional to enter Thusness | Negation |
| Shared | Conventional, immovable, *is* Thusness | Non-dual emptiness |
| Distinct | "Move" Thusness to enter deeper Thusness | Progressive stages |
| Perfect | Do not move from Thusness, yet *is* Thusness | Already complete |

### Interpretation 3: Fundamental and Trace

> "The 'Thus' at the beginning of the sutra spoken at the World Honored One's Initial Attainment of the Way is the Original. The sutras spoken while appearing as a Buddha in the intermediate times, and the 'Thus' at the beginning of the sutra spoken today, are all Traces."

Even "Thus have I heard" has depth. The Ānanda speaking now is the Trace-Ānanda of the historical scene. But there's also an original Ānanda who heard the teaching incalculable kalpas ago.

---

### Interpretation 4: Contemplating the Mind

> "Contemplating the aforementioned meanings of 'Thus' regarding Siddhāntas, Teachings, and Traces: seeing them all as 'Dharma arising from causes and conditions' is the Shared Contemplation. Seeing 'Causes and conditions are Empty and Provisional' is the Distinct Contemplation. Seeing that all the above are the Middle Way is the Perfect Contemplation."

And the payoff:

> "If a person believes what you say, they will immediately see Me, and also see you, the Bhikshu Sangha, and the Bodhisattvas."

That's not poetry. That's practice. Your belief — right now — is Buddha-encountering.

**The Lesson**: Even "Thus have I heard" isn't just throat-clearing. It's Dharma. Depending on which Teaching you're listening through, the same two syllables open entirely different doors. The General Introduction is the tuning note before the symphony. But it's already the symphony.
