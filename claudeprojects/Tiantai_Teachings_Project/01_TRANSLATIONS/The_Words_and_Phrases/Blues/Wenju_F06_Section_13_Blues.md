### The Setup

Now listen.

This short unit marks the chapter turn:

`釋信解品`

with its associated witness note.

---

### Function of the Marker

This is not decorative labeling.

It acts as a textual handshake:

- close prior transmission-method discourse
- open the belief-understanding interpretive domain
- preserve edition-level continuity across roll framing

---

### Witness Discipline

This marker preserves:

- `[9]` witness line

including the note about alternate roll-heading tradition.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 13 secures a clean gate between thematic regimes.

It keeps downstream interpretation anchored to an explicit chapter threshold.

### The Lesson

Even one title line can hold transmission discipline when treated as a formal gate.

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] B13 chapter marker preserved.
- [x] Witness `[9]` continuity preserved.
- [x] Transition function preserved without adding new doctrinal payload.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
