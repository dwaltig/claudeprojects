### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi says the long-form parable has two layers:

1. general parable
2. specific parable

This section sets the general frame.

---

### General vs Specific in the Long Prose

He ties the two layers back to the earlier Śākyamuni chapter-logic:

- general layer: brief verse-level "now I am also like this" summary
- specific layer: forty-one-and-a-half-line expansion of six intentions in opening-three/revealing-one

So this is not free-floating storytelling.

It is a mirrored explanatory engine.

---

### The Six Elements of the General Parable

Zhiyi lists six components:

1. elder
2. house
3. one gate
4. five hundred persons
5. fire rising
6. thirty sons

Each item is doctrinally mapped.

---

### How the Mapping Works

He aligns each image to prior doctrinal terms:

- elder -> the transforming Buddha as one-era guide
- house -> the locus corresponding to the unstable three realms
- one gate -> the gate of Buddha-way proclamation
- five hundred persons -> sentient beings in scope
- fire -> five turbidities and eight sufferings
- thirty sons -> beings with three-vehicle dispositions already known by Buddha

This is architecture, not ornament.

---

### Witness Discipline

The section closes with apparatus continuity:

- `[3] 中【大】，〔－〕【甲】`

Variant noted, mapping retained.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 20 hands us the index key for the full burning-house movement.

If these six anchors are stable, the later details remain readable.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 總譬 | General parable | Master chart layer | Gives condensed doctrinal map |
| 別譬 | Specific parable | Detail-run layer | Expands each mapped function |
| 開三顯一 | Open three, reveal one | Three lanes resolved in one road | Main Lotus interpretive move mirrored in simile form |
| 長者 | Elder | Householder-guide figure | Embodies Buddha's guiding authority |
| 火宅 | Burning house | Crisis world-frame | Names existential instability of saṃsāric life |
| 三十子 | Thirty sons | Three-vehicle aptitude field | Marks latent capacity gradients among beings |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi tunes the listener before the blaze narrative deepens. If you know the six anchors, the whole parable stays doctrinally legible.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Two-layer (general/specific) parable structure preserved.
- [x] Six-element general scaffold preserved in order.
- [x] Element-to-doctrine mapping preserved.
- [x] Opening-three/revealing-one linkage preserved.
- [x] Apparatus witness `[3]` continuity preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
