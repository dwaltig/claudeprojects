### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi states two equality chapters:

1. equal children
2. equal carts

Equal children means equal Buddha-nature relation.

Equal carts means equal great-vehicle Dharma relation.

---

### Why "Each Given" Still Appears

He clarifies "each given" does not break equality.

It means:

- each receives according to prior practice idiom
- each prior idiom is opened into the real
- all are still the same great vehicle

Difference of entry, sameness of fulfillment.

---

### Cart Description as Virtue Topology

The long ornament list is doctrinally mapped:

- height/width -> vast Buddha-knowledge
- rails/bells/canopy/jewels -> dhāraṇī, eloquence, immeasurables, adorned virtues
- ropes/garlands/cushion/white ox/attendants -> vows, responsive means, meditative depth, pure wisdom-drive, expedient service

So the cart is a full-bodied path-body, not decorative fantasy.

---

### Why There Are Carts to Give

Zhiyi grounds it in abundance:

- treasury overflowing
- practice-store and principle-store both complete
- self-cultivation and transformation-of-others both full

Hence giving is neither scarce nor selective in final intent.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 30 is the doctrinal heart of equal-bestowal.

It joins equality, differentiation-in-delivery, and inexhaustible Dharma abundance.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 等子 | Equal children | Same lineage standing | Equality of Buddha-nature relation |
| 等車 | Equal carts | Same great vehicle grant | Equality of final Dharma conveyance |
| 各賜 | Each given | Differentiated doorway, same destination | Preserves prior capacity idioms without final inequality |
| 高廣 | High and broad | Vast range vehicle-body | Marks depth and breadth of Buddha-knowledge |
| 白牛 | White ox | Pure wisdom drive-force | Moving power of untainted liberating cognition |
| 財富藏溢 | Wealth and store overflow | Inexhaustible Dharma treasury | Reason equal giving is possible |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi's equal-gift logic is rigorous: one nature, one vehicle, many entry habits, no final deprivation.
