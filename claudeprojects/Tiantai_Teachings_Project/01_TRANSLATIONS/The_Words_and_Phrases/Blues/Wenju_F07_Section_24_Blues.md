### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi pivots with the line: "today again speaking Lotus."

This is not a restart from zero.
It is a convergence move:

- ancient causal line is recalled
- present assembly is clarified
- direct teaching is resumed
- prior opening-three operations are recontextualized inside present-time clarity

---

### Convergence Function

This block binds temporal registers:

- past teaching events are not discarded
- present speech act is not merely repetitive
- the same great intention is shown as continuous across eras

So the phrase "today again" means recurrence with deepened integration.

---

### Witness Discipline

This F07-B24 block is mapped as an architecture transition segment with no additional apparatus bundle in scope.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 24 protects temporal coherence.

Without it, readers split old and current teachings into unrelated episodes instead of one unfolding line.

### The Lesson

When the Buddha says it again,
it is the same heart speaking deeper into a riper field.
