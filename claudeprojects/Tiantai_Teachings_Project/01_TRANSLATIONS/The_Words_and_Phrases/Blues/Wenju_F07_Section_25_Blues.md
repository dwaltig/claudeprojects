### The Setup

Now listen.

The guide-parable opens.

A leader appears when travelers are strained,
and the route to treasure is still unfinished.

Zhiyi uses this image to map a fivefold doctrinal structure:

- guide role
- difficult route condition
- provisional city deployment
- renewed movement
- real destination continuity

---

### Why the Guide Appears

The guide is not replacing treasure.
The guide is preventing collapse before treasure.

This is compassionate route management:

- protect the exhausted
- prevent turning back
- resume the journey with confidence

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B25 apparatus continuity:

- `[A1] 輪【CB】【宮-CB】，論【大】`
- `[1] 生【大】，〔－〕【甲】`
- `[2] 我今【大】，今我【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 25 opens the operational heart of 化城譬.

Without this guide function, the whole parable can be mistaken as merely spatial imagery instead of liberation logistics.
