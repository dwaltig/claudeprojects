### The Setup

Now listen.

After doubt is cleared, Zhiyi opens the real line directly.

He says this six-line unit contains the Four Ones in full. That means this is not a side remark. It is structural reclassification of the whole assembly.

---

### The Four Ones Layout in This Passage

Zhiyi maps the lines this way:

1. two lines: **Person-One** -> practitioners of three vehicles are all Buddha-sons
2. one line: **Principle-One** -> Buddha-wisdom / Buddha knowledge-and-vision as the single real line
3. two lines: **Teaching-One** -> only the unsurpassed path is finally taught
4. one line: **Practice-One** -> all will become Buddhas

So the revelation is not abstract metaphysics alone. It is person, principle, teaching, and practice all re-threaded into one route.

---

### Second Internal Fourfold Meaning

Zhiyi then overlays another fourfold reading of the same passage:

- great-capacity arousal (also called seeking fruit)
- Buddha's joy as beings receive Great-Vehicle benefit
- direct revealing of the real
- acceptance/practice/awakening/entry

This gives both ontology and pedagogy in one unit.

---

### The Four-Case Capacity Matrix

He adds a precise matrix for capacity and obstruction:

1. obstacles removed, capacity not yet arisen
2. great capacity arisen, obstacles not yet removed
3. obstacles removed and capacity arisen
4. neither removed nor arisen (five-thousand type)

This blocks simplistic all-or-nothing narratives and shows staged awakening profiles.

---

### "Seeking" Clarified: Three Layers

Zhiyi explains "seeking" in three layers:

- seeking as latent capacity toward fruit
- inward affective seeking (will it be gained or not)
- explicit verbal seeking (earnest repeated request)

He notes earlier teachings already had inner forms of seeking, but now all three forms converge.

---

### Straight Path vs Crooked Path Framing

He draws a strong line:

- five vehicles as previously handled are curved/indirect
- shared/distinct partial framings remain side-angled
- here the single straight path is explicitly spoken

Yet this is not rejection of former teachings as useless. It is their integration and surpassing within real disclosure.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 8 is where expedient compassion and ultimate declaration meet without contradiction.

The same beings previously trained through smaller channels are now fully named as Buddha-destined in one coherent architecture.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 四一 | Four Ones | Four-channel unity board | Core architecture for revealing-the-real in this unit |
| 佛子 | Buddha-sons | Family-name restored under the real line | Person-One reclassification of three-vehicle practitioners |
| 佛慧 / 佛知見 | Buddha wisdom / Buddha knowledge-and-vision | Master seeing line | Principle-One anchor of final disclosure |
| 但說無上道 | Only speak unsurpassed way | No side route in the final statement | Teaching-One closure marker |
| 悉亦當作佛 | All likewise become Buddhas | Everybody in this line has Buddha-endpoint | Practice-One destination claim |
| 索果 | Seeking the fruit | Longing that finally turns articulate | Capacity and request dynamic in disclosure timing |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi's revealing-real section says this plainly: what looked like separate tracks were never separate destinies. Once the time is right, all four channels lock together and the assembly is named in Buddha terms.

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Six-line Four-Ones mapping preserved.
- [x] Secondary fourfold pedagogical reading preserved.
- [x] Four-case obstacle/capacity matrix preserved.
- [x] Three-layer meaning of "seeking" preserved.
- [x] Straight-path declaration preserved without erasing expedient history.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
