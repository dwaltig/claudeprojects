### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi asks a practical launch question right after the opening calibration logic:

Why did the first wheel-turning land on five people?

His answer is direct and strategic: the first public lock-in happens where truth can be seen, witnessed, transmitted, and socially stabilized.

---

### Q/A 1: Why Turn the Wheel First for Five Persons?

Question:

Why begin with five?

Answer cluster:

- humans first see the truths
- humans are publicly visible as evidence-bearers
- humans function as witnesses
- Buddha's enacted life-work aligns with human-mode practice
- devas gain benefit through human dharma-fields
- the four assemblies operate in the human world

So the first turn is not favoritism. It is transmission architecture.

---

### The Human Plane as Proof-Field

Zhiyi implies a hard rule:

Dharma that cannot be demonstrated in a shared human field cannot stabilize as history.

The human realm supports:

- observable transformation
- accountable testimony
- repeatable instruction pathways
- institutional continuity via fourfold assembly life

This is why the opening turn anchors here.

### Q/A 2: Why Do Different Attainments "Sound" to Different Heaven-Levels?

Next question compares reach-scale:

- wheel-turning king's emergence reaches one heaven band
- Kauṇḍinya's attainment reaches Brahmā band
- Buddha's attainment reaches even higher purity bands

Why?

Zhiyi answers by karmic grade and virtue-grade:

- good-karma, reputation-karma, and honoring-teacher/parent karma have upper/middle/lower magnitudes
- higher realization carries broader resonance

He also preserves the Mahāyāna expansion line: Buddha-attainment resonance pervades vast, immeasurable world-fields.

---

### What "Sound" Means in This Section

This is not just acoustic mythology.

"Sound" here means the effective radius of liberative significance:

- how far an attainment reorders beings' possibility-space
- how widely an awakened act can be received as operative truth

So higher attainment = wider liberative broadcast.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 1 told us why full-dose Great is staged.

Section 2 tells us where and how staged release gets socially and cosmically anchored:

- begin where witness and community can hold it
- unfold in graded radiance according to realization depth

That is doctrinal fidelity plus transmission realism.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 轉法輪 | Turn the Dharma wheel | Drop the teaching cut into the world | Marks the public launch of liberative instruction |
| 五人 | Five persons | First five ears in the room | Initial human witness-body for Dharma stabilization |
| 人為證 | Humans as witnesses | Living receipts on the line | Verifiability principle in first-turn transmission |
| 四眾 | Four assemblies | Fourfold keeper network | Social vessel for continuity of teaching and practice |
| 聲至梵天 | Sound reaches Brahmā heaven | Broadcast reaches higher channel | Graded resonance marker by realization depth |
| 十方無量世界 | Ten-direction immeasurable worlds | All-field transmission spread | Mahāyāna scale of Buddha-attainment influence |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi shows that compassion is not abstract. It chooses a field, a witness base, and a transmission radius. The first turn starts where beings can prove, share, and carry it. Then realization-sound expands as depth expands.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Both Q&A units (five-person launch and graded sound-reach) preserved.
- [x] Human-first rationale retained as witness/transmission logic, not anthropocentric slogan.
- [x] Karma-grade explanation retained for differing reach-levels.
- [x] Mahāyāna pervasion line preserved without flattening earlier graded schema.
- [x] Continuity maintained from Section 1 calibration logic.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
