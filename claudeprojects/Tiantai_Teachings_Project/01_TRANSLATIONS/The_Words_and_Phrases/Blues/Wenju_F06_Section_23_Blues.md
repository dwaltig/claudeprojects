### The Setup

Now listen.

The question challenges causal framing:

if after Buddha's responsive withdrawal beings generate delusion, isn't that father leaving child rather than child leaving father?

Zhiyi answers by responsivity principle:

when beings no longer evoke response, the appearing withdrawal still resolves back into child-leaving-father logic.

---

### "Other Country" Clarified

He glosses:

- Buddha-domain / nirvāṇa domain as own-country
- birth-death and five-desire domain as other-country

"Long stay" names prolonged non-return after retreat.

---

### Number Symbolism

He reads "ten / twenty / fifty" as wheelings across destinies.

One person can cycle across the full field.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 23 stabilizes agency logic in the parable and grounds the geography symbols doctrinally.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves:

- `[16] 反【大】＊，返【甲】＊`
