**Lotus Chapter Covered**: Track 3 — Parable (譬喻品), fascicle-six opening seam before verse expansion

---

### The Setup

Now listen.

Fascicle Six opens with two anchor lines:

- `妙法蓮華經文句卷第六上`
- `天台智者大師說`

---

### Why This Opening Matters

This unit is a transmission seam, not filler.

It does three jobs:

- confirms entry into Fascicle Six Upper
- reasserts authorial lineage attribution
- sets an auditable boundary before the long verse-analysis block begins

---

### Continuity from Fascicle Five

Fascicle Five ended on a closure colophon.

Fascicle Six begins with a mirrored opening stamp.

That close/open pair keeps the line continuous without content bleed.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 01 gives a clean doctrinal ledger reset.

From here, the verse architecture can unfold with boundary clarity.

| 卷首題記 | Opening colophon heading | Session-open ledger line | Establishes deterministic start point |
| 邊界續接 | Boundary continuation | Clean handoff seam | Ensures no drift across fascicle transition |

### The Lesson

A precise beginning is doctrinal care. The roll opens exactly where the source opens.

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Heading and author lines preserved one-to-one in function.
- [x] No line-13 content folded into this section.
- [x] Fascicle transition seam treated as a formal unit.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
