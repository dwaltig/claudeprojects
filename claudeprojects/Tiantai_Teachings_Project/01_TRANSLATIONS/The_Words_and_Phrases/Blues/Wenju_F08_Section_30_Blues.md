### The Setup

Now listen.

This section carries mapped block `F08-B30` as defined in the audited workboard.

Source scope in this block:

- T1718_008.txt lines 208-210 chapter architecture chain (長行三分 + 諸天供養 opening)

---

### Argument Flow

This unit is handled as a source-locked chain:

- keep the mapped clause order intact
- preserve doctrinal handoff from prior block
- maintain restart-safe continuity for the next block

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves mapped witness scope:

- No additional apparatus bundle is listed for this mapped block.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 30 keeps Fascicle 8 deterministic and auditable.

By pinning tone-pass prose to the existing source-lock card, we preserve meaning while sustaining the Blues register.
