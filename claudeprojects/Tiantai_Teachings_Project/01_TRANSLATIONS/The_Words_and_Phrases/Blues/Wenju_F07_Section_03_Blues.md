### The Setup

Now listen.

From "如來復有" onward, Zhiyi maps what the disciples' grasp did not yet cover.

He gives a fourfold diagnostic:

- retreating not reached
- advancing not reached
- horizontal not reached
- vertical not reached

Then he adds two higher calibrations:

- both horizontal-and-vertical not reached
- neither horizontal-nor-vertical not reached

---

### Why This Is Not a Rejection of Their Realization

This is not a full negation.

Zhiyi's point is developmental scope:

- their uptake is real
- their uptake is not yet exhaustive

The line compares earlier mind against later mind without denying the authenticity of initial awakening.

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B03 apparatus continuity:

- `[1] 云云【大】，〔－〕【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 03 prevents false closure.

Without this grid, readers can mistake partial reception for final completion and collapse the chapter's pedagogical arc.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 領所不及 | What understanding did not reach | Uncovered reception span | Marks remaining scope in realization |
| 退 / 進 | Retreat / advance | Lower-side miss / upper-side miss | Diagnoses directional partiality |
| 橫 / 豎 | Horizontal / vertical | Cross-realm spread / stage-depth climb | Tests breadth and depth coverage |
| 亦橫亦豎 | Both horizontal and vertical | Time-space full sweep | Adds three-times continuity check |
| 非橫非豎 | Neither horizontal nor vertical | Non-binary equality field | Protects inconceivable Tathagata impartiality |
| 不盡 | Not exhausted | Real but unfinished uptake | Clarifies non-negating critique |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi honors what was genuinely received while refusing to call it the whole sky.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] F07-B03 reception-limit taxonomy preserved.
- [x] Retreat/advance and horizontal/vertical ordering preserved.
- [x] Non-negating "not exhausted" logic preserved.
- [x] Witness `[1]` preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
