### Manjushri's Forty-Five Lines of Verse

Everything Manjushri said in prose, he now puts into song. Forty-five lines of verse — but they don't repeat everything. Zhiyi maps what gets versified and what doesn't:

- The Thinking-and-Measuring Answer? **Not versified.**
- The Brief Past-Seeing Answer? **Not versified.**
- The Broad Past-Seeing? **Partially versified** — only the beginning and end, not the middle.
- The Clearly Judging Answer? **Versified** — the final four verses.

Two whole movements of prose get skipped. The verses don't repeat what the prose already covered in detail. Instead they zoom in on the biggest story — the Broad Past-Seeing — and the decisive judgment at the end.

### Versifying the Broad Past-Seeing

The verses open with two lines on the time-period, name, and preaching of the past buddhas — confirming they are the same.

Then: from "Before the Buddha left home" onward — thirty-nine lines versifying the final Buddha's three samenesses:

**One line** — versifies Past same as Already (the Buddha's sons)

**Fifteen and a half lines** — versify Past same as Now. These break into two:

1. **Fourteen lines** on the six omens of This Land and Other Lands:
   - **Four lines** on This Land's six omens being the same. And here the verses add something the prose didn't mention: "the heavenly drums sound of themselves." That's the drum that beats without being struck — a sign of teaching that comes without being asked. Like the Asura's Harp from Section 3, but now it's a drum. The music plays before anyone requests it.
   - **Ten lines** on Other Lands' six omens being the same. The prose only said "like what is seen now" — abbreviated. The verses expand it. These ten lines break into **five parts**:
     - Three lines — seeing sentient beings in the six destinies (same)
     - One line, two phrases — seeing the Buddhas (same)
     - Two phrases — hearing the sudden teaching's Seven Goods (same)
     - Three lines — seeing the three vehicles: sravakas and the rest (same as opening the gradual teaching)
     - Two lines — seeing bodhisattvas and various causes-and-conditions (same as opening the Vaipulya and Prajna teachings)

2. **One and a half lines** on the four assemblies harboring doubt — retrospectively versifying the past Buddha's assembly, which doubted just as the present assembly doubts.

And now a Q/A embedded in the verses:

**Question**: "If arousing the true path is natural, why is there need for the buddhas to preach Dharma?"

**Answer**: "It is like a boat going with the current: if it meets wind and adds oar-assistance, it quickly reaches its destination. The wind is a metaphor for seeing the Buddha and hearing Dharma; the oars are a metaphor for cultivation."

You're already floating downstream — that's your buddha-nature carrying you. But wind and oars speed you up. The Dharma is the wind. Practice is the paddle. Without them, you'd get there eventually. With them, maybe in one or two lives instead of seven.

And the Three Bodies appear in a single line: "Naturally accomplishing the Buddha-path" is the reward body. "Lapis-lazuli" is the dharma-body's original purity. "Golden image" is the response body — manifesting form to meet beings. Three bodies in three images.

**Twenty-two and a half lines** — versify Past same as Will Be. Six parts matching the prose:

1. **Two lines, two phrases** — the causal person (Wonderfully Bright / Sariputra)
2. **One phrase** — the preaching name (same)
3. **One line, one phrase** — the time period (sixty small kalpas perceived as half a day), plus Wonderfully Bright fully receiving and holding the past Buddha's dharma — like Sariputra receiving the Buddha's entrustment
4. **Five lines** — announcing extinction (answering the other-land extinction question). Here there is announcing extinction and entrustment: "the entrustment is like the *Bequeathed Teachings*; there is sorrow and weeping like the *Nirvana*; there is consoling admonition also like the *Bequeathed Teachings*." Those who can be liberated are liberated; those not yet ready are given the causes for future liberation — like the current Buddha about to entrust the teaching to Maitreya.
5. **One and a half lines** — bestowing prediction (on Virtue Store)
6. **Twelve lines** — passing on the sutra. Five sub-parts:
   - Two lines — after the Buddha's extinction, time-period and the four assemblies gaining benefit. "Like fire is extinguished when the fuel is exhausted": in the small vehicle, the body is fuel and wisdom is fire — body gone, wisdom gone. In the great vehicle, beings' capacities are fuel and responsive manifestation is fire — capacities exhausted, manifestation ceases. "Redoubling exertion" — those who are to be guided through extinction *are* guided.
   - Two phrases — the person who propagates (Wonderfully Bright)
   - Two phrases — the duration (eighty small kalpas)
   - Eight lines — the disciples benefited. First three lines: the eight sons whose practice accomplished, long ago attaining Buddhahood. Next five lines: the disciples who *will* become — those still on the way.
   - One line — concluding and uniting ancient with present

### Movement 4: The Clearly Judging Answer

The final four verses. And here Zhiyi corrects the old critics one more time.

The old interpretation: these four verses are just a conclusion to "cause beings to yearn and admire." Zhiyi says: "Now I explain it is not so." These verses correspond to the Clearly Judging Answer in the prose. They're not decorative. They're *decisive*.

The four verses map to four decisions:

| Verse | What It Decides |
|---|---|
| **"I see Lamp Bright Buddha..."** | Decides the previous omen of Expounding Dharma — "Will preach Great Vehicle sutra" |
| **"Now the marks are like the root omen..."** | Decides the previous omen of Raining Flowers — "Teaching bodhisattva dharmas" |
| **(Third verse)** | Decides the previous omen of Assembly Rejoicing |
| **"All those seeking the three vehicles..."** | Decides the previous omen of Earth Shaking — "Buddha's protection and mindfulness" |

And "entering samadhi" — the general omen — is entirely within all of them. The baseline hum, again.

### The Four Latent Doubts: Manjushri's Counter-Move

Now Zhiyi reveals something no one else saw.

Remember the Four Latent *Difficulties* from Section 4? That was Maitreya forcing Manjushri to answer — four rounds of "you have to respond." Now Zhiyi shows that Manjushri's four verses do the same thing in reverse: they are the **Four Latent Doubts** (四伏疑) — Manjushri *cutting off* four doubts that Maitreya might raise, *before* Maitreya can ask.

**Doubt 1**: Maitreya secretly wonders: "Buddhas respond to conditions; persons and times differ. Although the ancient Buddha preached the *Lotus*, why must the current Buddha be the same?"

Manjushri cuts it off: *"I see the Lamp Bright Buddha; the root light-omen was like this. By this I know the current Buddha desires to preach the Lotus Sutra."* — This cuts off the doubt about the **name**.

**Doubt 2**: Maitreya wonders: "Some have the same name and the same meaning; some have the same name and different meanings. What does this name reveal?"

Manjushri cuts it off: *"The current marks are like the root-omen; this is the buddhas' Loving Tricks. The current Buddha emits light to assist in bringing forth the meaning of real marks."* — This cuts off the doubt about the **substance**.

**Doubt 3**: Maitreya wonders: "Real marks are markless — who can comprehend it?"

Manjushri cuts it off: *"All people now should know: with joined palms, wait with one mind; the Buddha will rain the Dharma rain, fully satisfying those who seek the path."* — This cuts off the doubt about the **principle**.

**Doubt 4**: Maitreya wonders: "When the Buddha rains the Dharma rain, does it only reach bodhisattvas? Does it also moisten the two vehicles?"

Manjushri cuts it off: *"All those seeking the three vehicles — if they have doubts and regrets — the Buddha will remove and cut them off, causing them to be exhausted with none remaining."* — This cuts off the doubt about the **function**.

Four doubts. Four answers. Before the doubts are even asked. "Maitreya continuously constructs doubts; Manjushri repeatedly troubles himself to cut them off. When events are exhausted and principle is brought to completion, it is obtained in the heart."

And then — Zhiyi's pride showing through: "Guangzhai only knows to recount Master Zhao's explanation of the four latent difficulties, causing Manjushri certainly to answer, thereby displaying Maitreya's excellence. He does not see Manjushri explaining the four latent doubts and causing Maitreya not to ask, thereby restraining Wonderfully Virtuous' ability."

Guangzhai saw one half. He saw Maitreya forcing the answer. He didn't see Manjushri closing the door on further questions. He celebrated the questioner but missed the answerer's genius.

"**This meaning comes from Tiantai; it is not transmitted from other commentaries.**"

That's Zhiyi planting his flag. Nobody else saw this. The Four Latent Difficulties and the Four Latent Doubts are a matched pair — call and response, question and closure, the front row and the elder, each one doing their work. And only the Liner Notes Writer caught both.

"I send a message to later worthies: do not stifle others' strengths. Since after Master Zhao, over several hundred years, lecturers on the *Lotus* have overflowed the roads — how many have ever seen this meaning?"

### The Lesson

The verses don't just repeat the prose — they expand where the prose was brief and skip where the prose was thorough. And in the final four verses, Manjushri does something no one but Zhiyi ever noticed: he answers four doubts Maitreya hasn't asked yet. The Four Latent Difficulties (Maitreya forcing Manjushri to talk) and the Four Latent Doubts (Manjushri silencing Maitreya's next questions) are a matched set — the most sophisticated call-and-response in the whole Introduction. One pushes open the door; the other closes it behind them. And Zhiyi, the Liner Notes Writer, is the only one in several hundred years of Lotus commentary who saw both halves. He says so himself. He earned it.
