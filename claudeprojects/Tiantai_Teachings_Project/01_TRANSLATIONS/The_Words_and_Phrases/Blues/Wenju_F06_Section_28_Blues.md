### The Setup

Now listen.

This seam block marks:

- end of Fascicle Six Upper
- start of Fascicle Six Lower
- author attribution reset

---

### Why the Seam Matters

It is a formal transmission hinge:

- closes one roll-unit cleanly
- opens the next without ambiguity
- anchors continuity for subsequent father-son meeting expansions

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 28 is the operational lock that keeps the long F06 narrative auditable across roll boundaries.

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 卷第六上 | Fascicle Six Upper | Side-A close stamp | Marks first half completion |
| 卷第六下 | Fascicle Six Lower | Side-B open stamp | Marks second half entry |
| 題記橋接 | Colophon bridge | Roll seam handoff | Ensures continuity integrity |
| 作者復標 | Author re-marking | Lineage voice reset | Reasserts attribution at re-entry |
| 分卷連續 | Cross-roll continuity | No-break narrative carry | Keeps large arc coherent |
| 邊界校準 | Boundary calibration | Audit-safe seam control | Prevents drift across parts |

### The Lesson

The seam is part of the teaching body. A clean bridge protects the whole argument.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] B28 seam triad preserved (upper close, lower open, attribution).
- [x] Cross-part continuity function preserved.
- [x] No doctrinal overreach added beyond seam function.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
