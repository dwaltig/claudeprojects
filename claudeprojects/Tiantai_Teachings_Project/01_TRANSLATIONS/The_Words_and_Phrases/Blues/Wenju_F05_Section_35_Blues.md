### The Setup

Now listen.

This is the closing doctrinal compression of the whole specific-parable run.

Zhiyi aligns every major movement back into a single teaching logic.

---

### First Integration: Seeing Fire

He maps:

- seeing subject -> Tathāgata's quiescent-illumining wisdom eye
- seen fire -> eight sufferings rising from four inversions
- deluded children -> no weariness toward suffering, no search for release
- Buddha response -> great compassion and great loving-kindness

Order shifts can occur between parable and synthesis, but doctrinal function remains stable.

---

### Second Integration: Set Aside Direct Great, Activate Expedient Means

Zhiyi says the synthesis primarily joins the encouragement side (warning implied).

He correlates:

- body/hand -> power/wisdom
- garment/desk/bench -> Buddha knowledge, powers, fearlessness gradations
- no-reception -> heavy five-turbidity obstruction
- cessation of first approach -> compassionate pivot, not final abandonment

Then three-vehicle teaching is deployed with show/assure structures.

---

### Third Integration: Equal Great-Cart Giving

He fuses relief and equal-granting meanings:

- children are out of immediate danger
- Buddha contemplates inexhaustible wisdom treasury
- all children are his children
- one-sign and one-kind merit field grounds the great vehicle

The cart body is read via three virtues and full adornments.

---

### Fourth Integration: Not False

He resolves truth-status:

- promising three then giving one is not deceptive
- because original intent was liberation and full benefit
- expedient distinction arose from recipients, not from Buddha's final intent

So "non-false" is secured by intention, method, and fulfilled outcome.

---

### Witness Cluster Integrity

This synthesis block preserves a dense witness chain:

`[3] [4] [5] [6] [＊3-1] [＊3-2] [A1] [1] [2]` and related variants.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 35 closes the argumentative architecture of Fascicle 5's parable exposition.

It confirms that compassion, expedient means, and ultimate one-vehicle disclosure are one continuous act.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 合別譬 | Integrating specific parable | Full-chain doctrinal weave | Consolidates all specific-parable stages |
| 寂照智眼 | Quiescent-illumining wisdom eye | Still-seeing liberation sight | Basis for seeing beings in danger accurately |
| 機教相稱 | Capacity and teaching correspond | Receiver-fit line | Core principle behind effective pedagogy |
| 一相一種 | One sign, one kind | Shared great-vehicle ground | Equality basis in final grant |
| 方便誘引 | Expedient guiding pull | Skillful leading strategy | Means-phase before full disclosure |
| 不虛 | Not false | Promise fulfilled in full scope | Final integrity seal |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi's final move is coherence: many forms, one liberating intent, zero contradiction.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Four-stage synthesis (seeing fire/pivot/equal grant/non-false) preserved.
- [x] Mutual-manifestation order flexibility preserved without loss of function.
- [x] Expedient-to-one-vehicle continuity preserved.
- [x] Non-false resolution preserved as intention+method+outcome coherence.
- [x] Witness cluster continuity preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
