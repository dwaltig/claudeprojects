### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi divides the father-son loss parable into four segments, each with paired internal articulations.

This is high-precision narrative scaffolding.

---

### Four Segments

1. child turns away
2. father searches then pauses
3. child arrives near father's city
4. father's sorrow and joy dynamic

He maps each to near/remote receiving threads.

---

### Why the Gate Matters

The one gate here is not merely architectural.

It carries emotional-doctrinal dual force:

- sorrow because separation persists
- joy because the same gate can become return-route

This is loss architecture already containing recovery potential.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 21 is the blueprint for the whole trust-recovery narrative.

If this structure is clear, later pursuit and transfer movements stay coherent.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves the B21 witness chain:

`[8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [＊1-1] [14]`

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 父子相失譬 | Father-son loss parable | Separation engine | Opens trust-recovery narrative arc |
| 子背父去 | Child turns away from father | Break in alignment line | Initial rupture movement |
| 父求子中止 | Father seeks child then pauses | Compassion searching under conditions | Holds longing without forcing closure |
| 子遇到本國 | Child reaches original country | Return-near threshold | Recovery proximity marker |
| 憂喜雙行 | Sorrow and joy in tandem | Grief-and-hope braid | Emotional logic of rescue narrative |
| 分章竟 | Division complete | Structural lock confirmed | Formal closure of this architecture pass |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi maps separation with such care that return becomes legible before it happens.

- [x] B21 four-segment/two-tier structure preserved.
