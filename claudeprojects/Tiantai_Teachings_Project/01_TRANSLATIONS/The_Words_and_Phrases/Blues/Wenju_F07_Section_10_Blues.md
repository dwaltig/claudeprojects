### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi closes this arc by binding two claims:

- grasses and trees are not identical in manifest form
- all trajectories ultimately return to one empty-real horizon

Difference is preserved in function.
Non-difference is preserved in consummation.

---

### Closure Logic

The closure refuses collapse in both directions:

- do not erase gradation in practice-history
- do not deny common return in ultimate truth

So "ultimately return to emptiness" is not nihilism.
It is the non-dual destination that gathers differentiated teaching lines.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B10 apparatus continuity:

- `[1] 空【大】，於空【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 10 completes the first major Medicinal-Herbs doctrinal arc.

It locks the grammar needed for everything that follows: graded means, single reality.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 卉木差別 | Grasses/trees differentiation | Visible growth variance | Preserves pedagogical gradation |
| 終歸於空 | Ultimately return to emptiness | Final homeward convergence | Declares shared non-dual destination |
| 權實不二 | Provisional and real not-two | Means-ground non-severance | Keeps bridge and destination linked |
| 近遠歸趣 | Near/far destination tendencies | Short-run and long-run endpoint map | Tracks staged and ultimate outcomes |
| 究竟 | Ultimate completion | Final doctrinal lock | Marks consummated interpretation |
| 非斷非常 | Neither annihilation nor permanence-fixation | Middle-way closure rule | Protects emptiness from extremes |

---

### The Lesson

The branches differ.
The rain is one.
The return is one.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] F07-B10 closure chain preserved.
- [x] Difference and non-difference co-presence preserved.
- [x] "Ultimately return to emptiness" interpreted as non-dual consummation, not negation.
- [x] Witness `[1]` preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
