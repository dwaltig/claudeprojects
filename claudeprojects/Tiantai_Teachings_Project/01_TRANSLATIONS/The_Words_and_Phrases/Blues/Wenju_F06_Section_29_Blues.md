### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi opens the father-son meeting parable and links it both near and far:

- near: fire-house "seeing fire" sequence
- far: five-turbidity diagnosis in earlier doctrinal exposition

---

### Two Priority Orders (Parent First / Child First)

He explains why the text can say either "father first sees child" or "child first sees father":

- from Buddha-side, wisdom precedes response
- from sentient-side, capacity appears before responsive manifestation

He then says this mutuality is not temporal contradiction.

---

### Structural Simplification

For textual convenience, he runs two major sections:

1. child sees father
2. father sees child

and then subdivides each.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves:

- `[3] 不分卷【甲】`
- `[4] 之【大】，〔－〕【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 29 sets the logic frame for all subsequent meeting, fear, pursuit, and entrustment units.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 父子相見譬 | Father-son meeting parable | Reunion engine | Main second movement of the expanded parable |
| 機應互舉 | Capacity-response mutual presentation | Two-way trigger logic | Explains parent-first/child-first alternation |
| 前後不定 | Non-fixed before/after | Sequence-flex in one function | Removes false contradiction reading |
| 文便二段 | Two sections for textual convenience | Practical narration cut | Keeps analysis legible |
| 近領遠領 | Near receiving and far receiving | Dual-layer correspondence | Links present parable to earlier doctrinal scaffolds |
| 見火對應 | Seeing-fire correspondence | Diagnostic continuity | Preserves structural alignment with prior cycle |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi treats meeting as relational event, not one-direction causality.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] B29 near/far correspondence preserved.
- [x] Parent-first/child-first mutuality preserved.
- [x] Two-section simplification preserved.
- [x] Witnesses `[3]/[4]` preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
