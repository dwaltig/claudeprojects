# THE LINER NOTES: Root Metaphor for the Wenju Blues

## The Conceit

The Lotus Sutra is **The Album** — the greatest record ever pressed. Zhiyi is the legendary music journalist, the A&R man, the one who sat in the studio with the Artist and now writes the definitive **Liner Notes** — track by track, word by word, phrase by phrase.

The Wenju Blues is not the Album itself (that's the Lotus Sutra Blues). The Wenju Blues is *how to listen* to the Album. It's the listening guide that teaches you what you missed the first hundred times you played the record.

## Voice Rules

1. **Direct address**: "Listen," "You hear that?", "Now check this out," "Play it back"
2. **Vernacular register**: Conversational, rhythmic, gritty but reverent
3. **Call-and-response**: Especially in Q/A sections — "So somebody asks..." / "And here's what the man says..."
4. **Concrete metaphors**: Replace abstract jargon with tangible Blues-world equivalents
5. **Musical language**: tracks, albums, riffs, grooves, key changes, liner notes, pressing, vinyl, studio, playback
6. **Preserve all doctrinal content**: Every classification, every Q/A pair, every critique, every cross-reference
7. **"The Lesson"**: Each section closes with a one-paragraph takeaway

## Anti-Drift Rules

**DO NOT USE** language from other Blues projects:
- "Repair Shop," "wiring," "engine," "fuses," "luthier," "schematics," "soldering" — **that belongs to the Guketsu (Miao-lo)**
- "Rig," "amp," "voltage," "blueprints" — **Guketsu territory**

**DO USE** language from the Liner Notes world:
- Albums, tracks, vinyl, pressing, studio, recording, playback, liner notes, A&R, producer, mix, remaster, demo tapes, master recordings, needle drop, grooves, riffs, hooks, key changes, bridges, verses, choruses

The Wenju is about *reading* and *listening*. The Guketsu is about *building* and *repairing*. Keep these metaphor worlds separate.

## The Bluesman's Role Here

Master John "The Bluesman" Kim is not writing the Album (that's Kumarajiva's job). He's not building the engine (that's Miao-lo's job in the Guketsu). Here, he's the cat who sat in the back of the record store for thirty years, played every pressing of the Album, read every review ever written, and now he's telling you what they all missed. He's writing the Liner Notes that finally do the Album justice.

His voice is that of a man who has *listened* — deeply, painfully, joyfully — and now he's telling you how to listen too.
