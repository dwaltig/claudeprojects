### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi opens the combined-specific synthesis (thirty-and-a-half lines).

He first aligns the "seeing fire" segment, then the "set aside desk/use carts" segment.

---

### Seeing Fire: Threefold Correspondence

Verse and synthesis both keep the triad:

1. Tathāgata as seer
2. beings as the seen-in-fire condition
3. compassion entering the rescue dynamic

This preserves the diagnostic-to-response arc.

---

### Set-Aside and Cart Strategy

Zhiyi compresses the failed direct approach and the expedient cart deployment:

- attempted instruction
- non-reception due to deep attachment
- pivot to three-vehicle guidance
- recipients moving according to capacity

He notes some prose subdivisions are omitted in verse but functional logic remains.

---

### Decision and Completion Markers

"Decision" lines map to stabilized path entry.

"Completion" lines map to distinct vehicle-completion stations in the combined reading.

So this unit remains procedural, not merely lyrical.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves the B09 witness bundle:

`[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [＊5-1]`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 09 is where the combined-specific engine turns on: diagnosis, failed direct method, expedient pivot, and effective response become one coherent sequence.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 合別譬 | Combined-specific parable | Detail-merge operation | Integrates specific sequence into doctrinal synthesis |
| 見火譬 | Seeing-fire simile | Crisis detection phase | Diagnostic start of compassionate action |
| 捨几用車 | Set aside desk, use carts | Method pivot under non-reception | Expedient shift preserving final intent |
| 方便 | Expedient means | Receiver-fit path shaping | Adapts teaching to capacity constraints |
| 心決定 | Mind decision | Stabilized commitment point | Marks threshold of reliable movement |
| 具足三明及六神通 | Full triple knowledge and six powers | Completion powers signature | Endpoint marker in tiered vehicle language |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi's synthesis shows compassion as disciplined sequence: see clearly, pivot skillfully, carry effectively.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] B09 opening synthesis structure preserved.
- [x] Seeing-fire triad preserved.
- [x] Non-reception-to-expedient pivot preserved.
- [x] Decision/completion markers preserved.
- [x] Witness bundle `[1]-[＊5-1]` preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
