### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi now turns to the verses and shows how the same three-joy structure is compressed, redistributed, and intensified.

He explicitly says prose and verse cross-reveal each other.

---

### Verse Macro Structure

He maps the verse block (25.5 lines) in three parts:

1. one line: mark the three joys
2. twenty-two lines: explain the three joys in depth
3. two-and-a-half lines: conclude completion

So verse is not summary-only; it is reconfigured analysis.

---

### Prose and Verse Reciprocity

Key Zhiyi move:

- prose foregrounds loss and distance
- verse foregrounds nearness and regained Great-line continuity

Neither cancels the other. They are reciprocal disclosures.

He calls this mutual manifestation from different sides.

---

### Two Non-Hearing Modes

In the "not hearing Dharma" sequence, Zhiyi distinguishes:

- ordinary clinging (wrong-view mode)
- two-vehicle clinging (Dharma-nature fixation mode)

Both can block true hearing, even though they look different from outside.

So obstruction is not only gross error; refined fixation can obstruct too.

---

### Day/Night Dialectic

He reads day/night imagery with multiple layers:

- saṃsāra as night / nirvāṇa as day
- then deeper reversal where both become "night" until non-dual doubt is broken

When awakening dawns, both dual doubts collapse.

This is a subtle anti-dual move inside the joy sequence.

---

### Final Verse Movement: Obtaining Cause, Understanding Expedient

Zhiyi says the last major part clarifies:

- spoken cause now received
- expedient method now understood
- previous confusion of real/provisional now corrected

Then conclusion verses seal body/mouth/mind joy completion.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 15 teaches how to read doctrinal recovery in poetic compression.

Verse here is not ornamental emotion. It is high-density correction of mistaken reception.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 二十五行半 | Twenty-five and a half lines | Compact full-set arrangement | Verse-scale architecture for three-joy reinterpretation |
| 互現 | Mutual manifestation | Two takes, one master line | Prose/verse reciprocity principle |
| 不聞法 | Not hearing the Dharma | In-room but not receiving | Diagnostic of both coarse and subtle obstruction modes |
| 生死為夜 / 涅槃為日 | Saṃsāra night / nirvāṇa day | Dark-pass / light-pass image pair | Used, then deepened into non-dual doubt-clearing |
| 得所因 / 解方便 | Obtain spoken cause / understand expedients | Catch the key / read the bridge method | Marks restored doctrinal coherence |
| 結成 | Concluding completion | Lock the sequence to the end | Seals three-joy realization in body-speech-mind terms |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi's verse reading shows mature recovery: what was once misheard becomes clear when cause and expedient are both understood. Joy then is not hype; it is the felt proof of corrected hearing.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] 25.5-line three-part verse architecture preserved.
- [x] Prose-loss / verse-gain reciprocity preserved.
- [x] Dual non-hearing modes preserved (ordinary and two-vehicle fixation).
- [x] Day/night reinterpretive depth preserved.
- [x] Final cause+expedient restoration logic preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
