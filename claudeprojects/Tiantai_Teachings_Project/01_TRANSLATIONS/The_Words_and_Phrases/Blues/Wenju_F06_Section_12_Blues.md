### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi expands the "pass / not pass" chapter in two major stretches:

1. do not force to harmful hearers (great-compassion gate)
2. do teach receptive hearers (great-kindness gate)

He insists both gates must be harmonized.

---

### First Stretch: Compassionate Non-Transmission

If arrogance, laziness, distortion, and slander conditions dominate,
forcing teaching can produce heavier harm.

He describes this as "cutting the Buddha-seed" in worldly continuity.

So non-transmission here is protective compassion.

---

### Second Stretch: Compassionate Transmission

He then lists paired signs of suitable hearers:

- present and past roots
- upper and lower relational virtues
- inner discipline and outer seeking
- self-cultivation and ability to teach others
- beginning request and ending commitment

This yields a method: match transmission to readiness profile.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves the B12 witness set:

`[4] [5] [6] [7] [8]`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 12 gives operational transmission ethics.

Without this discernment, circulation becomes either violence or negligence.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 可通不可通章 | Chapter on can-pass/cannot-pass | Transmission eligibility protocol | Core discernment framework |
| 大悲門 | Great compassion gate | Do-not-harm gate | Withhold when forcing would increase harm |
| 大慈門 | Great kindness gate | Do-not-withhold gate | Teach when readiness protects and nourishes growth |
| 斷世間佛種 | Cutting Buddha-seed in the world | Severing awakening continuity | Names grave consequence of slandered reception |
| 五雙十隻善人之相 | Five pairs, ten signs of good hearers | Ten-signal readiness matrix | Practical profile for transmission suitability |

### The Lesson

Zhiyi's transmission ethic is twin-fidelity: protect the unready from harm, protect the ready from omission.
