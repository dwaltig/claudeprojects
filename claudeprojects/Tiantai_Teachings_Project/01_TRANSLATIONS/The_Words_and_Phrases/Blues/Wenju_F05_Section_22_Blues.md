### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi now expands "rank/title" through a ten-virtue profile.

He does this across three levels:

1. worldly elder
2. supramundane elder
3. contemplative elder

---

### The Worldly Ten-Virtue Set

He lists ten marks for worldly "great elder":

1. noble lineage
2. high station
3. great wealth
4. strong authority
5. deep intelligence
6. advanced age
7. pure conduct
8. complete ritual propriety
9. praised above
10. relied on below

This is moral-social completeness, not merely money.

---

### Supramundane and Contemplative Lift

Zhiyi then lifts the same pattern:

- Buddha as supramundane great elder with ten powers and full virtues
- contemplative practitioner as "contemplative elder" when deep faith-understanding and correct contemplation operate

So the title migrates from social symbol to Dharma realization marker.

---

### Textual Fitting to the Sutra Phrases

He aligns the ten virtues to the sutra's wording around:

- great elder
- old age
- immeasurable wealth
- broad household
- many dependents
- one gate
- many people

Then notes one line appears unstated but can be included under "great." 

---

### Witness Discipline

Apparatus continuity in this unit:

- `[4] 儀【大】，議【甲】`
- `[5] 贍【大】，瞻【甲】`

Zhiyi's ten-virtue reading holds across those variants.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 22 stops reductionism.

"Great elder" is not a flat metaphor; it is a layered profile tying social imagery, Buddha virtue, and contemplative realization.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 十德 | Ten virtues | Ten-signal fullness profile | Defines "great elder" as integrated completeness |
| 世長者 | Worldly elder | Publicly recognized elder-line | Base social-ethical layer |
| 出世長者 | Supramundane elder | Buddha-level elder line | Transcendent doctrinal layer |
| 觀心長者 | Contemplative elder | Inner-practice elder mark | Practice-realization layer |
| 上歎下歸 | Praised above, relied on below | Trusted top to bottom | Vertical social-spiritual legitimacy |
| 大字兼之 | "Great" includes the missing mark | One word carries the absent clause | Hermeneutic completion move |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi widens one title into a three-tier diagnostic: society, Buddhahood, and contemplative life all converge in "great elder."

---
