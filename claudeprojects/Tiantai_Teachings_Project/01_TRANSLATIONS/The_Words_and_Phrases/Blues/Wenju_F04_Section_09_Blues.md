### The Setup

Now listen.

This is one of Zhiyi's hardest editorial rooms.

He takes "opening, showing, awakening, entering" and tests interpretation after interpretation. A lot of inherited readings get rejected, not because they are always useless elsewhere, but because they do not fit this Lotus-specific architecture.

He is guarding signal integrity.

---

### The Four Ones Frame

Competing readers label the four as different combinations of fruit, person, teaching, and cause.

Zhiyi presses a key objection:

The text repeatedly says "in order to cause sentient beings..." That keeps the center on transformed beings receiving benefit, not on importing an abstract split that overrides the local discourse flow.

So when a model forces the line into a premature fruit-gate or breaks sequence context, he rejects it.

---

### Why So Many Systems Get Rejected

He moves through numerous systems:

- inherited chapter-splitting schemes
- three-wisdom overlays that mismatch this sutra's intent
- stage-mapping systems pulled from other doctrinal corpora
- four-wisdom and two-truth constructions when deployed out of register
- cross-text splice models that carve three clauses into one scripture and one clause into another

His repeated complaint is precise:

Do not import a framework just because it exists elsewhere. If it does not meet the Lotus line's own grammar, audience logic, and purpose-flow, it is a bad mix.

---

### The Treatise Sequence as One Strong Anchor

Zhiyi still works with treatise logic where it fits:

- unsurpassed meaning
- sameness in Buddha-nature/dharma-body horizon
- not-knowing of two-vehicle lines before awakening
- non-retrogressive establishment

But he does not let this become a mechanical substitution.

He keeps sequence, capacity, and purpose tied together.

---

### The Compositional Point

Zhiyi is not anti-system.

He is anti-misfit system.

If a framework helps reveal Buddha knowledge-and-vision in this text's own force-field, use it.
If it forces foreign scaffolding onto the line and causes cause/fruit confusion or sequence damage, drop it.

That is strong editorial dharma: not eclectic for its own sake, not rigid for its own sake.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 四一 | Four Ones | Four-track unity board | Core interpretive frame under dispute |
| 開示悟入 | Open, show, awaken, enter | Four-stage access sequence | Main Lotus movement under competing readings |
| 佛知見 | Buddha knowledge-and-vision | Buddha-seeing line | Criterion term Zhiyi protects from dilution |
| 次第 | Sequence/order | Track order integrity | Used to test whether a model distorts flow |
| 穿鑿 | Forced chisel-work | Doctrinal over-editing | Zhiyi's critique of splice-heavy misreads |
| 不與經會 | Not meeting the sutra | Out-of-register mix | Failure test for imported frameworks |

---

### The Lesson

This section is a warning to interpreters: broad learning is not a license to patch anything into anything. Zhiyi models disciplined selection. Keep what meets the Lotus line; discard what merely sounds sophisticated while breaking sequence, audience orientation, or doctrinal target.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Four-Ones dispute context preserved.
- [x] Mass-rejection logic preserved (misfit framework critique, not blanket anti-system rhetoric).
- [x] Treatise-compatible sequence retained without over-substitution.
- [x] "Not meeting the sutra" used as evaluation standard.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
- [x] No doctrinal simplification into one-axis model.
