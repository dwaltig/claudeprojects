Now listen.

Fascicle 1 gave you the equipment check — the Four Methods, the Threefold Division, the whole mixing board. Now Fascicle 2 introduces the **session musicians**: the great Arhats who were present when the Buddha opened the Lotus Sutra.

These aren't just names on a list. Zhiyi takes every single Arhat and runs them through the Four Methods:

1. **Causes and Conditions** — What's the backstory? Why does this Arhat have this name?
2. **According to Teaching** — How does this Arhat's quality manifest in each of the Four Teachings?
3. **Fundamental and Trace** — What's the Arhat's true identity vs. their manifest role?
4. **Contemplating the Mind** — What does this Arhat teach *you* about your own practice?

Every name is a teaching. Every biography is a Dharma gate.

## The Method

Watch how Zhiyi works. For every Arhat:

1. He gives you the **etymology** — where the name comes from, what it means.
2. He gives you the **biography** — the key story that defines them.
3. He gives you the **Four Siddhāntas** — how their story fulfills all four modes of teaching.
4. He gives you the **Four Teachings** breakdown — what the quality means at each doctrinal level.
5. He gives you the **Fundamental and Trace** — the eternal identity behind the manifest form.
6. He gives you the **Contemplating the Mind** — the practice application.

This is the liner notes method applied to personnel. Every musician in the studio has infinite depth.

## Why This Matters

You might think: "Why should I care about some monk who couldn't stop chewing like a cow?"

Because that's you.

Gavāmpati had residual habits from 500 lifetimes as an ox. He was an Arhat — fully awakened — but the habit-energy (*vāsanā*) persisted. The form was purified; the trace remained.

If you think awakening means instant perfection, you're wrong. Even Arhats carry traces. The question isn't whether you have residues — you do. The question is whether you can practice *despite* them.

Every Arhat in Fascicle 2 teaches this: awakening and imperfection coexist. The Buddha doesn't exclude the Arhats with quirks. He puts them in the front row.
