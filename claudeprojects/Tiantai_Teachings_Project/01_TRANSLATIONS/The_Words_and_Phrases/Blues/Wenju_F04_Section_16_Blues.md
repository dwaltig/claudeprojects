### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi has just pressed hard against false claims and overweening pride.

Then he immediately opens a needed nuance: after Buddha-extinction, conditions change. Difficulty of encountering true explainers changes accountability conditions.

This keeps strictness from becoming cruelty.

---

### The Exception Clause

He says: after Buddha-extinction, non-acceptance does not always count as overweening pride.

Why?

- good guides are hard to meet
- deep sutra meaning is hard to unpack
- textual presence does not guarantee interpretive access

So moral diagnosis must include historical condition, not just formal scriptural availability.

---

### The Doubt: Does This Mean Arhats End in Permanent Extinction?

Zhiyi says no.

Even if one currently takes "I am extinguished" as endpoint, post-life continuation can occur beyond the three realms in purified fields.

There, meeting another Buddha and hearing Lotus, one resolves decisively and completes Buddha-way trajectory.

So delayed hearing is delay, not doctrinal dead-end.

---

### Treatise Support and Lotus Citation

He invokes the Mahāprajñāpāramitā treatise line:

- arhat no longer reborn in three realms
- born in pure land beyond those realms
- hears Lotus there
- completes Buddha path

Then he loops back with Lotus citation: if arhats have not yet heard Lotus and think extinction is final, Buddha in other lands teaches them and brings them to Buddhahood.

Scripture and treatise are braided to secure the point.

---

### Competing Interpretations and Zhiyi's Selection

Zhiyi records alternate views (including Nányuè, Yáo, and another interpretation set), then declines one line as an "other explanation" not adopted here.

This is important methodologically:

- he documents interpretive plurality
- he evaluates
- he selects

No fake consensus, no laissez-faire relativism.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Without this section, earlier anti-pride warnings could be weaponized into flat condemnation of post-extinction practitioners.

Zhiyi refuses that misuse.

He keeps both truths:

- pride is real danger
- conditions are real constraints

Compassionate judgment accounts for both.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 開除釋疑 | Open exception, resolve doubt | Mercy clause plus clarity pass | Balances strict diagnosis with condition-aware nuance |
| 佛滅後 | After Buddha's extinction | Post-headliner era | Historical condition affecting reception accountability |
| 界外有餘之國 | Land-with-remainder outside realm | Out-of-circuit training field | Post-three-realms continuation site for unresolved arhats |
| 值遇餘佛 | Meeting another Buddha | Catching the next true set | Delayed but real completion mechanism |
| 決了 | Decisive resolution | Full lock-in hearing | Marks arrival at settled understanding |
| 四依 | Four Reliances | Four trusted guides | One interpretive line for "other Buddha" mediation |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi shows that delayed awakening is not denied awakening. The Dharma does not end where one life-stage ends. If conditions block full hearing now, the line can reopen in another field under another Buddha, and the path still completes.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Exception clause preserved without nullifying prior anti-pride warnings.
- [x] Post-extinction difficulty factors preserved (guide scarcity, depth of text).
- [x] "Other Buddha" completion logic preserved with treatise support.
- [x] Delayed-completion arc preserved as continuity, not contradiction.
- [x] Competing interpretations acknowledged with Zhiyi's selective stance retained.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
