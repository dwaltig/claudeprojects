### The Setup

Now listen.

The verse recalls the sixteen princes again,
not as repetition for ornament,
but as confirmation of sustained request-energy.

---

### Recurrence Function

This recurrence does two key jobs:

- confirms that earlier re-request logic remains operative
- ties prose history to verse memory so doctrinal sequence stays whole

The line keeps proving that persistence in hearing is itself part of skillful means.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B36 apparatus continuity:

- `[2] 本【大】＊，〔－〕【甲】＊`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 36 secures continuity between earlier narrative argument and later metrical recap.

Without recurrence markers, the reader can mistake structural memory for duplication.
