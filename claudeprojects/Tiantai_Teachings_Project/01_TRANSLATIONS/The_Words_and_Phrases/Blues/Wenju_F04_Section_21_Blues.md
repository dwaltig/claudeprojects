### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi pauses and does architecture-first guidance.

He says many legacy explanations are hard to follow and can confuse readers, so he lays down a clean working map before line-by-line reading.

This is interpretive project management.

---

### Two Major Divisions in the Śākyamuni Verse Block

He divides the section into:

1. a brief two-line summary verse (basis for the overall parable)
2. a broad forty-one-and-a-half-line expansion (basis for specific parables)

He further says the brief summary itself contains six intentions, enough to ground the six meanings of the overall parable.

---

### What the Brief Summary Seeds

From "Now I too am thus," he derives multiple bases:

- Śākyamuni as teaching-lord -> basis for elder parable
- "secure at ease" vs "not secure at ease" -> basis for nirvāṇa/burning-house contrast
- living beings in five paths -> basis for transformed assembly imagery
- various dharma doors vs single entry function -> basis for one-door logic
- knowledge of beings' natures/desires -> basis for differentiated-child imagery

So one compact verse seeds a full parable machine.

---

### Four-Way Breakdown of the Broad Expansion

He then maps the longer section into four bases:

1. five-corruptions sightline -> basis for seeing-fire parable
2. within-One opening-Three sequence -> basis for setting-aside-great/bestowing-small dynamics
3. revealing real -> basis for equal-bestowal of the great cart
4. rarity + no-falsehood + pressing faith cluster -> basis for the non-falsehood parable line

This is a control board for downstream exegesis.

---

### Why Zhiyi Revises Older Parable Counts

He surveys older schemes (three, six, ten, etc.) and finds recurring fit problems:

- sequence mismatch between dharma exposition and parable exposition
- unstable mapping of cause/fruit emphasis
- over-forced equivalences
- loss of three-round coherence

He does not reject earlier masters casually; he rejects mappings that fail textual-engineering tests.

---

### Method Lesson: Basis and Branch Must Carry Each Other

Zhiyi's explicit rule here: root and branch, above and below, must mutually carry with complete textual-meaning integrity.

If a parable map cannot preserve that load-bearing relation, discard it.

This is exacting but practical.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 總譬作本 | Make basis for overall parable | Main arrangement chart | Macro-structure anchor before details |
| 別譬作本 | Make basis for specific parables | Section-by-section cue sheet | Local parable mapping framework |
| 本末相承 | Root and branch mutually inherit | Topline and reprise stay linked | Integrity rule for textual architecture |
| 六意 | Six intentions | Six control channels | Minimal verse seed with maximal mapping power |
| 取捨 | Take and discard | Keep-fit/drop-misfit discipline | Method for evaluating interpretive schemas |
| 本迹 | Fundamental and trace | Master line and stage line | Dual-level reading axis used in mapping debates |

---

### The Lesson

This section shows Zhiyi not only as commentator, but as editor-composer. He wants a map that can be used, not merely admired. Keep basis and branch aligned, and the parable system stays intelligible. Lose that alignment, and everything turns to doctrinal fog.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Two-division macro structure preserved.
- [x] Six-intention summary-verse logic retained.
- [x] Four-way broad-expansion mapping retained.
- [x] Legacy parable-scheme critique preserved as fit-analysis, not polemic.
- [x] Basis/branch load-bearing rule preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
