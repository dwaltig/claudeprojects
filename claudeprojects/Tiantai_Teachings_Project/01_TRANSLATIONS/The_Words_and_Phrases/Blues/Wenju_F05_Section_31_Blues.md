### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi enters the fourth specific-parable movement: "not false." 

Its structure is precise:

1. question
2. answer
3. confirming praise

---

### Two Grounds for "Not False"

The answer has two main grounds:

1. **Heavy-over-light logic**: preserving life outweighs preserving lesser goods
2. **No betrayal of original intent**: giving one great cart does not violate compassionate purpose

Each ground has marker, explanation, and concluding reinforcement.

---

### Wisdom and Compassion Pairing

Zhiyi pairs two powers:

- rescue/relief function
- inexhaustible treasury function

Together they show why the elder's promise is not deception.

---

### Closing Praise

Buddha's "well said" confirms both non-false lines.

So doctrinal validity is not inferred only by commentators; it is textually sealed.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 31 prepares the final justification that expedient promise and ultimate grant are coherent.
