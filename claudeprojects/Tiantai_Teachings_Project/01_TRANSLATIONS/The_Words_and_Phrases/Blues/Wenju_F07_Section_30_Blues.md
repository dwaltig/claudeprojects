### The Setup

Now listen.

The declaration comes plain:

the treasure place is near.

With that, provisional-city reliance is intentionally retired and the real destination is directly stated.

---

### Reveal Logic

This is not contradiction with earlier city-use.
It is completion of it.

- provisional shelter preserved the travelers
- now direct real-reveal advances them
- nearness language restores urgency and confidence

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B30 apparatus continuity:

- `[5] 我【大】，〔－〕【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 30 is the explicit reveal marker.

It clarifies that compassionate detours terminate in clear destination speech.
