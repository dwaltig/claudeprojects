### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi begins the elder-parable in three divisions:

1. name and conduct
2. rank and title
3. virtue and function

He uses this triad to prevent loose symbolic reading.

---

### Why "Place" Is Mentioned

He says place-language (nation, town, village) is not geography chatter.

It displays name-conduct range:

near and far both recognize the elder's integrity.

So the image functions as relational scope, not map trivia.

---

### Earlier Commentarial Views and Zhiyi's Recast

He notes older readings mapping nation/town/village onto cosmic scales.

Then he redirects:

- here the parable emphasizes fruit-virtue usage
- "nation / town / village" is better read through three-land doctrinal correspondence

Mapping he gives:

- recompense land
- residual land
- shared land

This makes the image doctrinally operative.

---

### Trace and Root Movement

He adds the dynamic:

from root dropping trace,
from trace returning to root,
with no final host/guest split.

So the elder image supports fundamental/trace circulation.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 21 locks the opening grammar for the elder sequence.

Without this frame, later lists of virtues lose doctrinal location.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 名行 | Name and conduct | Reputation and lived line | First marker of the elder figure |
| 位號 | Rank and title | Public standing signal | Locates authority register |
| 德業 | Virtue and work | Inner quality, outer labor | Completes elder-profile triad |
| 國邑聚落 | Nation/town/village | Far-middle-near reception field | Scope markers for influence and recognition |
| 本垂迹 / 攝迹反本 | Root drops trace / trace returns root | Outward teaching and return movement | Trace/fundamental dynamic |
| 三土對映 | Three-land correspondence | Three-level doctrinal terrain | Reframes place language doctrinally |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi builds the elder figure as a doctrinal instrument: integrity across distance, authority across lands, and trace-root reciprocity.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] Three-part elder opening preserved.
- [x] Place-language function preserved as name-conduct scope marker.
- [x] Older mappings noted and Zhiyi's reframing preserved.
- [x] Three-land correspondence preserved.
- [x] Trace/root circulation preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
