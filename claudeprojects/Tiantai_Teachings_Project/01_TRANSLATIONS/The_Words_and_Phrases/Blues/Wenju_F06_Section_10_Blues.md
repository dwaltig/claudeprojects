### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi says this eight-line unit has two movements:

1. five lines closing equal-grant synthesis
2. three lines opening the non-false trust argument

---

### First Movement: Equal Grant Completion

He concentrates on:

- great cart chapter marker
- equal-heart chapter marker
- broad cart description
- rationale for why carts can be given

Then two verses describe receiving and playing in day/night terms:

- self-cultivation movement
- transforming-others movement

The single-vehicle line is reaffirmed: truly sought, no second.

---

### Second Movement: Non-False Transition

The shift begins:

- define "all are children" and original intention to give the great
- explain provisional three-vehicle speech as obstacle-removal strategy
- once obstacles clear, return to full Buddha-wisdom aim

This is the handoff into the larger non-false explanation.

---

### Witness Discipline

This B10 transition preserves:

- `[6] 此【大】，〔－〕【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 10 seals the equal-grant logic and cleanly opens the integrity-proof logic.

Without this hinge, the non-false argument loses its practical setup.
