### The Setup

Now listen.

This block transitions from formal handover to receiving joy:

"all I own" is transferred, and the former low-worker language is re-read as provisional appearance-language.

---

### "As-If" Diminishment

Zhiyi notes the earlier child-language can be "as-if" belittling,
used within adaptive process,
not final identity truth.

This protects continuity between prior pedagogy and present full transfer.

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 41 prevents contradiction between earlier low-position rhetoric and current full inheritance.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves:

- `[1] 窮【大】，實【甲】`

---

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 今我所有 | What I now own | Total transfer declaration | Announces full inheritance scope |
| 不求自得 | Obtained without seeking | Gift beyond prior expectation | Joy signature of completion |
| 貶之言似 | Diminishing speech as-if | Provisional lowering language | Reconciles pedagogy with final status |
| 正付轉喜 | Proper transfer turning to joy | Handover-to-delight shift | Transition function in narrative arc |
| 所有即知 | What was managed now possessed | Stewardship becomes ownership | Completion marker |
| 權語歸實 | Provisional speech returns to real | Adaptive language resolved | Removes apparent contradiction |

---

### The Lesson

Zhiyi shows that provisional lowering language can serve final raising without deceit.

---
