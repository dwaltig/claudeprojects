### The Setup

Now listen.

Zhiyi addresses the five-hundred-yojana measure.

The question is not cartography.
The question is pedagogical distance:

- how far delusion-pressure can carry a traveler
- where provisional rest becomes necessary
- when onward motion toward treasure can be resumed

---

### Adjudication Function

Distance language here is interpretive instrumentation.

It calibrates:

- burden tolerance
- stage placement
- teaching intensity needed for safe continuation

So the measure is doctrinally precise even when not read as literal surveying.

---

### Witness Discipline

This block preserves F07-B27 apparatus continuity:

- `[1] 樂【大】，隱【甲】`

---

### Why This Section Matters

Section 27 prevents shallow literalism.

Without adjudicating what the distance signifies, the city/treasure dynamics lose explanatory force.

### Blues Glossary: New Terms This Section

| Chinese Term | Literal | Blues Translation | Function |
|---|---|---|---|
| 五百由旬 | Five hundred yojanas | Calibrated endurance distance | Measures staged burden in the path narrative |
| 判釋 | Adjudicative explanation | Precision ruling | Fixes interpretive scope of symbolic distance |
| 中路困乏 | Mid-route exhaustion | Journey fatigue threshold | Determines need for provisional stabilization |
| 權息 | Provisional rest | Temporary doctrinal shelter | Keeps travelers from collapse or retreat |
| 復前進 | Resume advance | Restarted forward motion | Marks return from rest to treasure trajectory |
| 非量取義 | Taking meaning, not mere quantity | Sense-over-math reading rule | Protects doctrinal utility of numeric imagery |

---

### The Lesson

Some numbers are there to measure the heart,
not just the road.

---

### Translation Principles Applied (The Bluesman Code)

- [x] F07-B27 distance adjudication chain preserved.
- [x] Symbolic-functional reading preserved.
- [x] Rest-and-resume path logic preserved.
- [x] Witness `[1]` preserved.
- [x] Root metaphor sustained (Liner Notes register; no Repair Shop drift).
