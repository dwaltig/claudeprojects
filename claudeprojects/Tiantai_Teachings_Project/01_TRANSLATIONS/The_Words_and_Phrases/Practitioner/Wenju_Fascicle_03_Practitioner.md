## 6. THE SETUP: RECOGNIZING THE SIGNAL

Fascicle 3 is about **Pattern Recognition**.
Maitreya sees the omens (Light, Flowers, Shaking) and asks: *"What is happening?"*
Mañjuśrī says: *"I've seen this before."*

### The Tool: The Archive Search
When your practice gets weird—when the ground shakes (anxiety) or the light shines (insight)—you need to check the Archive.
*   **The Question:** Is this just random noise, or is it a Signal?
*   **The Answer:** If it follows the Pattern (The 6 Omens), it's a Signal. The "Big Download" (The Lotus) is coming.

## 7. THE STORY OF SUN MOON LAMP BRIGHT

Mañjuśrī tells a story about a Buddha from eons ago. Why?
To tell you that **You Have Been Here Before.**

### The 20,000 Buddhas
There were 20,000 Buddhas with the *exact same name*.
*   **The Lesson:** The "Buddha" isn't a personality. It's a **Function**. It's a role that gets played over and over again.
*   **Your Practice:** You aren't inventing Buddhism. You are stepping into a stream that has been flowing forever. The role is already written. You either play it or you're an amateur.

### The Eight Sons (Your Consciousness)
The Buddha had 8 Sons.
*   **The Metaphor:** These are your **Eight Consciousnesses** (Sight, Sound, Smell, Taste, Touch, Mind, Ego, Storehouse).
*   **The Transformation:** When the Buddha preached the Lotus, the "Sons" became "Dharma Princes."
*   **The Move:** Your eyes and ears aren't the problem; it's the filter. Don't suppress your ego. **Convert it.** Let the "Lotus" remove the filter from your raw data (Sons) so it shines as Wisdom (Princes).

## 8. THE FAME SEEKER (QIÚMÍNG)

This is the most important part for us.
Mañjuśrī reveals a secret: **Maitreya (the Future Buddha) used to be a "Bad Student."**

### The Profile of Infiltrator Fame Seeker:
1.  **Lazy:** He didn't like hard practice.
2.  **Distracted:** He read "secular books" (Novels? Twitter? Reddit?) instead of Sutras.
3.  **Greedy:** He liked hanging out with rich people and getting famous.

**And yet... he is the Future Buddha.**

### The Defense of the "Worldly Practitioner"
Zhiyi says: *Don't judge a book by its cover.*
Fame Seeker wasn't "bad." He was practicing **"Harmonizing the Light"** (*Héguāng*). He didn't look like a monk; he looked like a regular guy in the mix.
*   He went into the bars to save the drinkers.
*   He read the novels to understand the culture.
*   He got famous to use the platform for the Dharma.

**The Tool: The Trojan Horse**
*   **The Hustle:** You don't have to live in a cave. You can use your "Worldly Life"—your job, your social media, your "Fame Seeking"—as a vehicle.
*   **The Condition:** You have to remember the *Root*. Fame Seeker eventually planted enough "Good Roots" to become Maitreya. If you just seek fame *without* the Roots, you're just a narcissist. If you use the Fame *for* the Roots, you're a Road Warrior.

**Summary for the Road:**
Fascicle 3 tells you to **Trust the Process.**
*   The weird signs in your life? They are the Setup.
*   Your distracted, "worldly" mind? That's just the "Fame Seeker" phase. Keep planting the roots.
*   The "Lotus" is coming to explain it all.

**You are right on schedule.**
