## 4. THE EXPANDED CREW: MORE SLEEPER AGENTS

Fascicle 1 introduced the core team. Fascicle 2 reveals the rest of the **Secret Service**.
Again, these aren't just "Arhats." They are Ancient Bodhisattvas running a long-con operation to wake you up.

### 6. Gavāmpati (The Habit Checker)
*   **The Trace:** "Cow Ruminate." He has a habit of chewing like a cow because of past karma.
*   **The Fundamental:** He dwells in the **Ox-King Samādhi**. He proves that you can have "coarse habits" (Trace) and still be totally Enlightened (Fundamental).
*   **The Lesson:** Don't hate your habits. Watch them. Let the "Cow" chew, but keep the "King" awake.

### 7. Revata (The Body Double)
*   **The Trace:** "False Union." He realized his body wasn't "his" after seeing ghosts rip a corpse apart.
*   **The Fundamental:** He sees the **Dharma-Realm** as his body. He knows the "rental" is breaking down, but the Driver is fine.

### 8. Vakkula (The Iron Chin)
*   **The Trace:** "Longevity." Lived 160 years. Never spoke. Fire couldn't burn him.
*   **The Fundamental:** His longevity represents the **Eternity of Nirvana**. His silence represents **Purity**. He is the "Unmoving One."

### 9. Pūrṇa (The Secret Preacher)
*   **The Trace:** "Foremost in Teaching." The guy who preached to barbarians.
*   **The Fundamental:** **A Hidden Bodhisattva of the Distant Past.** He has been helping Buddhas turn the wheel for eons. He *chose* to appear as a Śrāvaka to help the rookies.
*   **The Lesson:** Sometimes you have to "dumb it down" to help people. That's not compromise; that's **Compassion**.

### 10. Ananda (The Ocean)
*   **The Trace:** "The Secretary." Memorized everything.
*   **The Fundamental:** **Ocean Ananda.** The Dharma doesn't just "stick" to him; it *flows* into him like rivers into the sea. He holds the **storehouse of all Buddhas**.
*   **The Lesson:** Don't just "remember" the teachings. Let them become your nature.

### 11. Rāhula (The Invisible Man)
*   **The Trace:** "The Son." Practiced secretly.
*   **The Fundamental:** He practices the **Invisible Action** (*Mìxíng*). He represents the "Obstacle" that protects the Middle Way from the extremes.

## 5. THE NUNS: THE MOTHERS OF THE PATH

The assembly isn't complete without the "Mothers."

### Mahāprajāpatī (The Source)
*   **The Trace:** The Buddha's Aunt/Foster Mother.
*   **The Fundamental:** She is **Prajñāpāramitā** (Perfection of Wisdom). She is the "Mother" from whom all Buddhas are born.
*   **The Lesson:** You have to mother your own practice. Feed it, clean it, protect it.

### Yasodharā (The Keeper)
*   **The Trace:** The Buddha's Wife.
*   **The Fundamental:** She represents **Retention** (*Dhāraṇī*). She holds the seed of Buddhahood within the "Samsara" world until it's ready to be born.

## 6. THE SIX OMENS: THE SIGNAL FLARE

Before the Buddha speaks the Lotus Sutra, he sets off **Six Flares** (The Auspicious Omens).
This is the "Pre-Flight Check."

### 1. The Rain of Flowers (The Download)
*   **What It Is:** Flowers rain from the sky.
*   **The Meaning:** The **Four Ranks** (Dwelling, Practice, Dedication, Ground) are raining down on everyone.
*   **The Vibe:** You are being showered with potential. The "Sky of Reality" is opening up.

### 2. The Earth Shakes (The Shake-Up)
*   **What It Is:** The ground moves in six ways.
*   **The Meaning:** **Breaking the Habit.**
    *   Ignorance is hard and fixed (like the earth).
    *   When the Truth comes, the "Ground" of your ego has to shake.
    *   **The Diagnostic:** If you feel "Unstable" or "Shaken Up," good. That means the Lotus is working. You can't build a new house without shaking the old foundation.
