## 17. THE ZOO IN YOUR HEAD (THE BESTIARY)

Before we get to the Prodigal Son, we have to talk about the animals in the Burning House.
This is a **Field Guide** to the thoughts that try to kill you when you sit down to meditate.

### The Dull Drivers (Animals)
*   **The Owl (Arrogance):** The thought that says, "I'm smarter than this."
*   **The Snake (Anger):** The thought that says, "Why is that guy chewing so loud?"
*   **The Fox (Greed):** The thought that says, "I wish I had his car."
*   **The Fighting Dog (Doubt):** The thought that says, "Is this working? Am I wasting my time?"

### The Sharp Drivers (Ghosts)
*   **The Yakṣa (Evil View):** The nihilist. "None of this matters. Eat the rich."
*   **The Naked Ghost (Self View):** The narcissist. "Look at me meditating. I look great."
*   **The Needle-Neck Ghost (Perverted View):** The addict. Infinite hunger, tiny capacity to receive.

**The Move:** Don't fight them. Identify them. "Oh, there's the Owl." "There's the Needle-Neck." Once you name the animal, it stops running the house.

## 18. THE PARABLE OF THE PRODIGAL SON: FROM JANITOR TO OWNER

This is the most important story for anyone who feels "Unworthy" of the Dharma.
You think: *"I can't be a Buddha. I'm just a normal person with a messy life."*
**Subhūti felt the exact same way.**

### Phase 1: The Runaway (The Departure)
You left your "Home" (The Original Vibe) a long time ago. You wandered into "The Ditch" (The Grind). You got a job digging ditches (Living day-to-day). You forgot you were rich.

### Phase 2: The Panic (The Encounter)
You stumble upon the "Father's House" (A deep Dharma teaching or a moment of awe).
**Reaction:** Panic. "This is too big. This is for saints and monks. I don't belong here."
You run back to the ditch.

### Phase 3: The Hiring (Cleaning Excrement)
The Father (Buddha) sends a foreman to hire you.
**The Job:** "Janitor."
**The Meaning:** This is the **Small Vehicle** practice.
*   **The Excrement:** The entire Three Realms—the **"Slop"** you live in.
*   **The Work:** Cleaning it up. Meditation, ethics, therapy.
*   **The Pay:** A daily wage. (You feel a little better each day).
*   **The Trap:** You think this is the *whole job*. You identify as the Janitor.

### Phase 4: The Promotion (The Contractor)
You get good at cleaning. The Father promotes you. He gives you the keys to the treasury.
**The Meaning:** You start **Advanced Agent** training. You talk about "Emptiness" and "Compassion."
**The Trap:** You still think you're an employee. You are managing *Someone Else's* gear. You're a contractor, still invoicing for your time. You don't feel like you **Own** the Dharma.

### Phase 5: The Inheritance (The Reveal)
The Father calls a meeting. He points at you and says: *"This is my Son. Everything I have is his."*
**The Meaning:** This is the **Lotus Sutra**.
The Buddha tells you: *"You aren't the Janitor. You aren't the Contractor. You are the Buddha."*
*   The "Excrement" you cleaned? That was just fertilizer.
*   The "Money" you managed? That was your own Wisdom.

**Summary for the Road:**
Fascicle 6 asks you one question:
**Are you still working for a wage?**
Are you practicing just to "feel better" (The Janitor)?
Or are you ready to claim your Inheritance (The Owner)?

The Janitor works to fix problems.
The Owner knows there are no problems, only assets.
**Stop cleaning the house. Move in.**
