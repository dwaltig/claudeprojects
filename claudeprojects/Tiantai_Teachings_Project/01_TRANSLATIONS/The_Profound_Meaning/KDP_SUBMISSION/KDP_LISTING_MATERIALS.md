---

**Full Description:**

What if the "truth" of Buddhism wasn't something distant to achieve—but something you already are?

**Practicing the Profound Meaning** distills the essence of Master Zhiyi's *Fahua Xuanyi*—the most comprehensive analysis ever written on the Lotus Sutra—into a 22-day practice guide for modern seekers.

Written in 6th-century China, the *Fahua Xuanyi* laid the foundation for Tiantai Buddhism and influenced Zen, Pure Land, and Nichiren traditions across East Asia. For centuries, it was accessible only to monastics and scholars. Now, for the first time, its core insights are available in an accessible format designed for daily practice.

**What You'll Discover:**

• **The Three Truths** — How to see emptiness, provisional existence, and the middle way in every moment of your life

• **The Ten Subtleties** — A map of practice from where you stand to complete awakening

• **The Five Keys** — Master Zhiyi's framework for unlocking any Buddhist teaching

• **Why you're already there** — The fruit is already in the flower. This book shows you how to see it.

**How It Works:**

Each of the 22 chapters presents one teaching with a Practice Prompt at the end. Read slowly. Let it sit. Return tomorrow. This isn't a book to consume—it's a practice to absorb, what the tradition calls "perfuming the mind."

**Who This Book Is For:**

• Practitioners who want to deepen their meditation with philosophical understanding
• Students of Zen or Nichiren who want to understand their tradition's roots
• Anyone drawn to the Lotus Sutra seeking practical guidance
• Readers curious about Chinese Buddhism beyond the basics

**What This Book Is Not:**

This is not a scholarly translation. It's an interpretive companion—a bridge between ancient wisdom and contemporary practice. For academic study, seek the complete Chinese text.
