## Part 1: Guanding's Preface and the Xù Wáng

### The Origins of the Private Record of the Lotus Sutra

**Composed by the Śramaṇa Guanding (灌頂, 561–632 CE)**

#### [1] On the Unparalleled Virtue of Master Zhiyi

大法東漸，《僧史》所載，詎有幾人不曾聽講，自解佛乘者乎？

> When the Great Dharma flowed eastward, as recorded in the *Histories of the Saṅgha*—how many were there who, never having attended a lecture, attained understanding of the Buddha Vehicle on their own?

縱令發悟，復能入定得陀羅尼者不？

> Even granting such awakening, could any then enter samādhi and attain dhāraṇī?[^f1p1-1]

縱具定慧，復帝京弘二法不？

> Even possessing both concentration (*samādhi*) and wisdom (*prajñā*), did any then propagate the Two Dharmas[^f1p1-2] in the Imperial Capital?

縱令盛席，謝遣徒眾隱居山谷不？

> Even with flourishing assemblies, did any then dismiss their disciples and seclude themselves in mountain valleys?

縱避世守玄，被徵為二國師不？

> Even while shunning the world and guarding the profound, were any then summoned to serve as National Preceptor to two dynasties?[^f1p1-3]

縱帝者所尊，太極對御講《仁王般若》不？

> Even being honored by emperors, did any then expound the *Renwang Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra* in the Tàijí Hall before the sovereign?

縱正殿宣揚，為主上三禮不？

> Even proclaiming the Dharma in the main hall, did any receive the Three Prostrations from the ruler?

縱令萬乘屈膝，百高座百官稱美讚歎，彈指喧殿不？

> Even having the Emperor of Ten Thousand Chariots bend his knee, did a hundred high seats and a hundred officials voice praise and admiration, snapping their fingers until the hall resounded?

縱道俗顒顒，玄悟《法華》圓意不？

> Even with monastics and laity in reverent attention, did any profoundly awaken to the Perfect Meaning of the Lotus Sutra?

縱得經意，能無文字，以樂說辯，晝夜流瀉不？

> Even having grasped the sūtra's meaning, could any transcend written words and, with the eloquence of joyful speech, pour forth teaching day and night without cease?

**唯我智者，具諸功德。**

> **Only our Master Zhiyi fully possessed all these virtues.**

#### [2] Guanding's Personal Testimony

幸哉灌頂，昔於建業，始聽經文；次在江陵，奉蒙玄義；晚還台嶺，仍值鶴林。

> How fortunate I, Guanding! Long ago in Jiànye,[^f1p1-4] I first heard the textual teachings. Later in Jiānglíng, I was graced to receive the *Profound Meaning*. In my later years, returning to Mount Tiantai, I was present for the Crane Grove.[^f1p1-5]

荊揚往復，途將萬里，前後補接，纔聞一遍。

> Traveling back and forth between Jing and Yang,[^f1p1-6] a journey of nearly ten thousand *li*, piecing together teachings from before and after—I barely managed to hear [the complete exposition] once through.

非但未聞不聞，亦乃聞者未了，卷舒鑽仰，彌覺堅高，猶恨緣淺，不再不三，諮詢無地，如犢思乳。

> It is not merely that what I had not heard remained unheard; even what I did hear remained incomprehensible. Rolling and unrolling [the text], studying and contemplating, I became ever more aware of its solidity and loftiness. Yet I lamented my shallow karmic connection—unable to ask a second or third time, with no place to make inquiry—like a calf longing for milk.

並復惟念：斯言若墜，將來可悲。

> Moreover, I thought: "If these words should be lost, future generations would be pitiable indeed."

《涅槃》明若樹若石，今經稱若田若里，聿遵聖典，書而傳之，《玄》、《文》各十卷。

> The *Nirvāṇa Sūtra* speaks of [inscribing the Dharma on] trees and stones; this present sūtra speaks of [planting seeds in] fields and villages.[^f1p1-7] Following the holy scriptures, I have written them down to transmit them—the *Profound Meaning* and the *Textual Commentary*, each in ten fascicles.

或以經論誠言，符此深妙；或標諸師異解，驗彼非圓。後代行者，知甘露門之在茲。

> Some [sections] use the sincere words of sūtras and śāstras to accord with this profound and wonderful [teaching]; others mark the divergent interpretations of various masters, verifying that those are not the Perfect [doctrine]. Practitioners of future generations will know that the Gate of Sweet Dew[^f1p1-8] is found herein.

### The Xù Wáng (Preface by the King)[^f1p1-9]

#### [3] Explanation of "Myō" (妙)

所言「妙」者，「妙」名不可思議也。

> What is meant by "Myō" (Wonderful)? The name "Myō" signifies *the inconceivable*.

所言「法」者，十界、十如、權實之法也。

> What is meant by "Dharma"? It is the Dharma of the Ten Dharma-Realms, the Ten Suchnesses, and the Provisional and Real.[^f1p1-10]

「蓮華」者，譬權實法也。

> "Lotus Flower" is a metaphor for the Dharma of Provisional and Real.

良以妙法難解，假喻易彰！

> Since the Wonderful Dharma is difficult to understand, metaphors make it manifest!

況意乃多，略擬前後，合成六也。

> Moreover, the meanings are many; briefly comparing the preceding and following, they combine into six.[^f1p1-11]

#### [4] The Six-Fold Lotus Metaphor: Trace Gate (迹門)

**一、為蓮故華，譬為實施權。**

> **First: "The flower exists for the sake of the lotus"—this metaphors *granting the Provisional for the sake of the Real*.**

文云「知第一寂滅，以方便力故，雖示種種道，其實為佛乘。」

> The text says: "Knowing the supreme extinction, yet through the power of skillful means, though he shows various paths, they are truly for the Buddha Vehicle."[^f1p1-12]

**二、華敷譬開權，蓮現譬顯實。**

> **Second: "The flower blooming" metaphors *Opening the Provisional*; "The lotus appearing" metaphors *Revealing the Real*.**

文云「開方便門，示真實相。」

> The text says: "Open the gate of skillful means, and reveal the marks of true reality."[^f1p1-13]

**三、華落譬廢權，蓮成譬立實。**

> **Third: "The flower falling" metaphors *Abolishing the Provisional*; "The lotus maturing" metaphors *Establishing the Real*.**

文云「正直捨方便，但說無上道。」

> The text says: "Setting aside skillful means directly, he teaches only the unsurpassed Way."[^f1p1-14]

#### [5] The Six-Fold Lotus Metaphor: Fundamental Gate (本門)

又蓮譬於本，華譬於迹，從本垂迹，迹依於本。

> Again: the *lotus* metaphors the *Fundamental* (本); the *flower* metaphors the *Trace* (迹). From the Fundamental, the Trace descends; the Trace depends upon the Fundamental.

文云「我實成佛來，久遠若斯。但教化眾生，作如是說：『我少出家，得三菩提。』」

> The text says: "In truth, since I attained Buddhahood, it has been this long. But to teach and convert sentient beings, I spoke thus: 'In my youth I left home and attained the three kinds of bodhi.'"[^f1p1-15]

**二、華敷譬開迹，蓮現譬顯本。**

> **Second: "The flower blooming" metaphors *Opening the Trace*; "The lotus appearing" metaphors *Revealing the Fundamental*.**

文云「一切世間皆謂今始得道；我成佛來，無量無邊那由他劫。」

> The text says: "All the world thought I had just now attained the Way; [but] since I became Buddha, it has been immeasurable, boundless nayutas of kalpas."[^f1p1-16]

**三、華落譬廢迹，蓮成譬立本。**

> **Third: "The flower falling" metaphors *Abolishing the Trace*; "The lotus maturing" metaphors *Establishing the Fundamental*.**

文云「諸佛如來，法皆如是。為度眾生，皆實不虛。」

> The text says: "All Buddha Tathāgatas—their Dharmas are all thus. For the sake of saving sentient beings, all is real and not false."[^f1p1-17]

#### [6] Summary of the Lotus Metaphor

是以先標妙法，次喻蓮華：蕩化城之執教，廢草庵之滯情；開方便之權門，示真實之妙理；會眾善之小行，歸廣大之一乘；上、中、下根，皆與記莂。

> Therefore, first the Wonderful Dharma is proclaimed, then the Lotus Flower is employed as metaphor: to sweep away the fixed teaching of the Conjured City,[^f1p1-18] to abolish the stagnant attachments of the Grass Hut;[^f1p1-19] to open the Provisional gate of skillful means, to reveal the wonderful principle of true reality; to integrate the small practices of various goods, returning them to the vast and great One Vehicle; beings of superior, middling, and inferior capacities—all receive the bestowal of prediction.

又發眾聖之權巧，顯本地之幽微，故增道損生，位隣大覺。

> Again, he manifests the expedient skill of the many Sages, revealing the subtle profundity of the Original Ground. Therefore, the Way increases and [transmigration in] birth diminishes; one's stage approaches the Great Awakening.

一期化導，事理俱圓，蓮華之譬，意在斯矣。

> In the single period of guiding transformation, both phenomena and principle are perfectly complete. The meaning of the Lotus Flower metaphor lies herein.

#### [7] On "Sūtra" (經)

「經」者，外國稱修多羅，聖教之都名。有翻、無翻，事如後釋。

> "Sūtra" (*Jīng*)—in foreign lands it is called *sūtra* (*xiūduōluó*, Skt. *sūtra*)—is the general name for the holy teachings. Whether translated or untranslated, the matter is as explained later.

### Commentary by the Recorder (Guanding)

記者釋曰：蓋「序王」者，敘經玄意。

> The Recorder's explanation: The "Xù Wáng" expounds the profound meaning of the sūtra.

玄意述於文心，文心莫過迹本。

> The profound meaning is expressed through the heart of the text; the heart of the text is none other than the Trace and the Fundamental.

仰觀斯旨，眾義冷然。

> Looking up at this purport, the multitude of meanings becomes crystal clear.

妙法蓮華，即敘名也；示真實之妙理，敘體也；歸廣大之一乘，敘宗也；蕩化城之執教，敘用也；一期化圓，敘教也；六譬，敘迹本也。文略意周矣。

> "Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower" expounds the *Name*. "Revealing the wonderful principle of true reality" expounds the *Substance*. "Returning to the vast and great One Vehicle" expounds the *Essence*. "Sweeping away the fixed teaching of the Conjured City" expounds the *Function*. "The single period of transformation is perfectly complete" expounds the *Teaching*. The six metaphors expound the Trace and Fundamental. The text is concise, yet the meaning is complete.

### Footnotes (Part 1)

[^f1p1-1]: **Dhāraṇī** (陀羅尼): Literally "that which holds/retains." In this context, it refers to the power of total retention of the Dharma, a mark of advanced meditative attainment.

[^f1p1-2]: **Two Dharmas** (二法): Likely referring to *cessation* (止, *zhǐ*, Skt. *śamatha*) and *contemplation* (觀, *guān*, Skt. *vipaśyanā*)—the two fundamental meditation practices that form the core of Master Zhiyi's teaching.

## Part 2: The Five-Fold Analysis Introduction

**Expounded by the Great Master Zhiyi of Tiantai**

### The Five Chapters (五重玄義)

　釋名第一　辨體第二　明宗第三　論用第四　判教第五

> 1. **Interpreting the Name** (釋名)
> 2. **Discerning the Substance** (辨體)
> 3. **Clarifying the Essence** (明宗)
> 4. **Discussing the Function** (論用)
> 5. **Classifying the Teaching** (判教)

### General and Particular Interpretations

釋此五章，有通、有別。

> In interpreting these five chapters, there is the *general* (通) and the *particular* (別).

通是同義，別是異義。

> The general refers to shared meaning; the particular refers to distinctive meaning.

如此五章，遍解眾經，故言同也。

> These five chapters can be used to interpret all sūtras—hence they are called "shared."

釋名名異，乃至判教教異，故言別也。

> Yet the Name differs [for each sūtra], and so on through to the Teaching classification—hence they are called "distinctive."

例眾經之初，皆安五事，則同義也。如是詮異，我聞人異，一時感應異，佛住處所異，若干人聽眾異，則別義也。

> As an example: at the beginning of every sūtra, five items are established—this is the shared meaning.[^f1p2-1] But "Thus" (*evam*) is interpreted differently, the "I heard" refers to different persons, the "one time" refers to different occasions of resonance, the Buddha's dwelling place differs, and the assembly of listeners differs—this is the distinctive meaning.

又通者，共義；別者，各義。如此通、別，專在一部。

> Again, "general" means *collective* meaning; "particular" means *individual* meaning. This general-and-particular [analysis] is directed specifically at this one text.

通則七番共解，別則五重各說。

> The general [approach] consists of **seven shared interpretations** (七番共解). The particular [approach] consists of **five layers of individual exposition** (五重各說).

例如利鈍，須廣略二門也。

> Just as [the teaching must accommodate] the sharp and the dull, it requires both the extensive and the concise approaches.

眾教通別，今所不論；一經通別，今當辨。

> The general and particular aspects of all teachings—that is not our present concern. The general and particular aspects of this one sūtra—that is what we shall now analyze.

### The Seven Shared Interpretations (七番共解)

△就通作七番共解：

> ▷ The general [approach] employs seven shared interpretations:

一、標章；二、引證；三、生起；四、開合；五、料簡；六、觀心；七、會異。

> 1. **Establishing the Chapters** (標章)
> 2. **Citing Evidence** (引證)
> 3. **Demonstrating the Arising** (生起)
> 4. **Opening and Combining** (開合)
> 5. **Critical Discrimination** (料簡)
> 6. **Observing the Mind** (觀心)
> 7. **Reconciling Differences** (會異)

#### The Purpose of Each Interpretation

標章令易憶持，起念心故。

> **Establishing the Chapters** makes them easy to memorize and retain, arousing the *mind of mindfulness* (念心).

引證據佛語，起信心故。

> **Citing Evidence** relies on the Buddha's words, arousing the *mind of faith* (信心).

生起使不雜亂，起定心故。

> **Demonstrating the Arising** prevents confusion and disorder, arousing the *mind of concentration* (定心).

開合、料簡、會異等，起慧心故。

> **Opening and Combining**, **Critical Discrimination**, and **Reconciling Differences** arouse the *mind of wisdom* (慧心).

觀心即聞、即行，起精進心故。

> **Observing the Mind** means to hear and immediately practice, arousing the *mind of vigor* (精進心).

五心立，成五根，排五障，成五力，乃至入三脫門。

> When the Five Minds are established, they become the Five Faculties (五根).[^f1p2-2] They dispel the Five Hindrances (五障), become the Five Powers (五力), and lead even to entry into the Three Gates of Liberation (三脫門).[^f1p2-3]

略說七重，共意如此。

> This is a summary of the seven levels and their shared purpose.

#### The Detailed Exposition

廣解五章者，一一廣起五心、五根，令開、示、悟、入佛之知見耳。

> The detailed interpretation of the Five Chapters causes each to extensively arouse the Five Minds and the Five Faculties, enabling one to *open, reveal, awaken to, and enter* the Buddha's knowledge and vision.[^f1p2-4]

### Chapter 1: Interpreting the Name (釋名)

○初標五章(云云)。標名為四：一、立；二、分別；三、結；四、譬。

> ○ First, establishing the Five Chapters... The establishment of the Name has four aspects: (1) Establishing, (2) Distinguishing, (3) Concluding, (4) Illustrating with metaphor.

#### 1. Establishing the Name

立名者，原聖建名，蓋為開深以進始，咸令視聽，俱得見聞，尋途趣遠，而至於極，故以名名法，施設眾生。

> **Establishing:** The original sage established names in order to open what is profound and advance those at the beginning. He caused all to look and listen, enabling all to see and hear. Following the path, they proceed from afar and arrive at the ultimate. Therefore, names are used to designate the Dharma, providing for sentient beings.

#### 2. Distinguishing Coarse and Wonderful

分別者，但法有麁妙，若隔歷三諦，麁法也；圓融三諦，妙法也。

> **Distinguishing:** Dharmas may be *coarse* or *wonderful*. If the Three Truths are held as separate and sequential, it is the coarse Dharma. If the Three Truths are perfectly interfused, it is the Wonderful Dharma.[^f1p2-5]

此妙諦本有，文云「是法住法位，世間相常住。唯我知是相，十方佛亦然。」

> This Wonderful Truth is originally existent. The text says: "This Dharma abides in its Dharma-position; the worldly marks are eternally abiding. Only I know this mark, and the Buddhas of the ten directions likewise."[^f1p2-6]

尚非不退菩薩、入證二乘所知，況復人天群萌之類。

> Even non-retrogressing bodhisattvas and the Two Vehicles who have entered realization cannot know it—how much less the masses of humans and devas!

佛雖知是，不務速說。

> Though the Buddha knows this, he does not hasten to teach it.

文云「我若讚佛乘，眾生沒在苦。謗法不信故，墜於三惡道。」

> The text says: "If I were to praise the Buddha Vehicle, beings immersed in suffering, slandering the Dharma and lacking faith, would fall into the three evil paths."[^f1p2-7]

所以初教建立融不融，小根併不聞...

> Therefore, in the First Teaching, both fused and unfused [truths] were established, yet those of lesser capacity did not even hear it...

[Content continues through the Five Periods of teaching]

今經正直捨不融，但說於融，令一座席同一道味，乃暢如來出世本懷，故建立此經，名之為妙。

> Now, this present sūtra directly sets aside the unfused and teaches only the fused, causing the entire assembly to share one flavor of the Way. This fully expresses the Tathāgata's original intention in appearing in the world. Therefore this sūtra is established and named "Wonderful."

#### 3. Concluding Statement

結者，當知《華嚴》兼，《三藏》但，《方等》對，《般若》帶。

> **Concluding:** You should understand that the *Avataṃsaka* (華嚴) *includes* [the One Vehicle with the separate vehicles]; the *Tripiṭaka* (三藏) teaches *only* [the separate vehicles]; *Vaipulya* (方等) *contrasts* [One with Three]; *Prajñā* (般若) *carries* [the Three while teaching the One].[^f1p2-8]

此經無復兼、但、對、帶，專是正直無上之道，故稱為妙法也。

> This sūtra no longer includes, only-teaches, contrasts, or carries. It is exclusively the direct, unsurpassed Way. Therefore it is called the Wonderful Dharma.

#### 4. The Lotus Metaphor

譬蓮華者，例有麁妙。

> **Illustrating with metaphor:** The lotus flower likewise has coarse and wonderful [examples].

云何？麁狂華無果，或一華多菓，或多華一菓，或一華一菓，或前菓後華，或前華後菓。

> How so? A coarse, wild flower has no fruit. Or one flower with many fruits. Or many flowers with one fruit. Or one flower with one fruit. Or fruit before flower. Or flower before fruit.

初喻外道，空修梵行，無所剋獲。次喻凡夫，供養父母，報在梵天。次喻聲聞，種種苦行，止得涅槃。次喻緣覺，一遠離行，亦得涅槃。次喻須陀洹，却後修道。次喻菩薩，先籍緣修，生後真修。

> The first illustrates non-Buddhists who cultivate pure conduct in vain and gain nothing. The second illustrates ordinary beings who serve their parents and are reborn in the Brahma heavens. The third illustrates śrāvakas who practice various austerities and merely attain nirvāṇa. The fourth illustrates pratyekabuddhas who practice one form of renunciation and also attain nirvāṇa. The fifth illustrates stream-enterers who later progress on the path. The sixth illustrates bodhisattvas who first rely on conditioned cultivation and later attain true cultivation.

皆是麁華，不以為喻。

> All of these are coarse flowers and are not used as the metaphor.

蓮華多奇：為蓮故華，華實具足，可喻即實而權；又華開蓮現，可喻即權而實；又華落蓮成，蓮成亦落，可喻非權非實。

> The lotus flower has many extraordinary [qualities]: **The flower exists for the sake of the lotus**—flower and fruit are complete together—this can metaphor *the Real manifesting through the Provisional*. **The flower opens and the lotus appears**—this can metaphor *the Provisional revealing the Real*. **The flower falls and the lotus matures; the mature lotus also falls**—this can metaphor *neither Provisional nor Real*.

如是等種種義便故，以蓮華喻於妙法也。

> Because of these many convenient meanings, the lotus flower is used to metaphor the Wonderful Dharma.

### Chapter 2: Discerning the Substance (辨體)

體者為四：一、釋字。二、引同。三、簡非。四、結正。

> The Substance has four aspects: (1) Explaining the character, (2) Citing agreement, (3) Discriminating what is not [the Substance], (4) Concluding the correct [Substance].

體字訓禮。禮，法也...

> The character *tǐ* (體, substance) is glossed as *lǐ* (禮, propriety/law). Propriety means law...

正指實相，以為正體也。

> [The teaching] directly points to *True Reality* (實相) and takes it as the correct Substance.

故〈壽量品〉云「不如三界，見於三界，非如非異。」

> Therefore, the "Lifespan" chapter says: "Unlike the three realms, yet seeing the three realms—neither same nor different."[^f1p2-9]

今取佛所見為實相正體也。

> Now we take what the Buddha sees as the correct Substance of True Reality.

### Chapter 3: Clarifying the Essence (明宗)

宗者為三：一、示。二、簡。三、結。

> The Essence has three aspects: (1) Indicating, (2) Discriminating, (3) Concluding.

宗者，要也。所謂佛自行因果，以為宗也。

> *Essence* (*zōng* 宗) means *essential*. The Buddha's own practice of cause and effect is taken as the Essence.

云何為要？無量眾善，言因則攝；無量證得，言果則攝。如提綱維，無目而不動；牽衣一角，無縷而不來。

> What makes it essential? Immeasurable goods—speak of "cause" and they are included. Immeasurable realizations—speak of "effect" and they are included. It is like lifting the main cord of a net: no mesh fails to move. It is like pulling one corner of a garment: no thread fails to follow.

故言宗要。

> Therefore it is called the "essential essence."

### Chapter 4: Discussing the Function (論用)

用者為三：一、示。二、簡。三、益。

> The Function has three aspects: (1) Indicating, (2) Discriminating, (3) Benefits.

用者，力用也。三種權實二智，皆是力用。

> *Function* (*yòng* 用) means *power and function*. The three kinds of Provisional-and-Real dual wisdom are all power and function.[^f1p2-10]

於力用中，更分別：自行二智，照理理周，名為力；二種化他二智，鑒機機遍，名為用。

> Within power and function, further distinction is made: The dual wisdom of self-practice, which illuminates principle thoroughly—this is called *power*. The two kinds of dual wisdom for transforming others, which discerns capacities universally—this is called *function*.

化功廣大，利潤弘深，蓋茲經之力用也。

> The transforming merit is vast and great; the benefit is profound and deep. This is the power and function of this sūtra.

### Chapter 5: Classifying the Teaching (判教)

教相為三：一、根性融、不融相。二、化道始終、不始終相。三、師弟遠近、不遠近相。

> The Teaching Classification has three aspects: (1) The marks of root-natures as fused or unfused. (2) The marks of the path of transformation as complete or incomplete. (3) The marks of teacher and disciple as remote or near.

教者，聖人被下之言也；相者，分別同異也。

> *Teaching* (教) refers to the sage's words bestowed upon those below. *Marks* (相) refers to distinguishing sameness and difference.

#### The Five Flavors

如日初出，前照高山，厚殖善根，感斯頓說。頓說本不為小，小雖在座，如聾如瘂，良由小不堪大，亦是大隔於小，此如《華嚴》。

> It is like the sun first rising, first illuminating the high mountains. Those who had thickly planted good roots were moved by this sudden teaching. The sudden teaching was not originally for those of lesser [capacity]. Though the lesser sat in the assembly, they were like the deaf or mute. This is because the small cannot bear the great, and the great is separated from the small. This is like the *Avataṃsaka*.

約法被緣，緣得大益，名頓教相。約說次第，名從牛出乳味相。

> Considered in terms of Dharma matching conditions, it is called the **Sudden Teaching Mark**. Considered in terms of the sequence of teaching, it is called the **Milk-from-the-Cow Flavor Mark**.[^f1p2-11]

次照幽谷...此如三藏...名酪味相。

> Next it illuminates the dark valleys... This is like the *Tripiṭaka*... called the **Curds Flavor Mark**.

次照平地...此如《淨名》、《方等》...生蘇味相。

> Next it illuminates the level ground... This is like *Vimalakīrti* and *Vaipulya*... the **Fresh Butter Flavor Mark**.

...具如《大品》...熟蘇味相。

> ...as in the *Great Perfection of Wisdom*... the **Clarified Butter Flavor Mark**.

...具如今經...醍醐味相。

> ...as in this present sūtra... the ***Ghee* Flavor Mark**.[^f1p2-12]

#### The Lotus Sutra's Unique Position

今《法華》是顯露，非祕密；是漸頓，非漸漸；是合，非不合；是醍醐非四味；是定，非不定。

> Now, this *Lotus Sūtra* is **revealed**, not secret. It is **gradual-becoming-sudden**, not gradual-upon-gradual. It is **unified**, not disunified. It is **ghee**, not the [previous] four flavors. It is **definite**, not indefinite.

如此分別，此經與眾經相異也。

> By these distinctions, this sūtra differs from all other sūtras.

### Footnotes (Part 2)

[^f1p2-1]: The "five items" at the beginning of every sūtra refers to the standard opening formula: "Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha dwelt at [place], with a great assembly of [beings]."

[^f1p2-2]: **Five Faculties** (五根): Faith, Vigor, Mindfulness, Concentration, and Wisdom.

[^f1p2-3]: **Three Gates of Liberation** (三脫門): Emptiness (*śūnyatā*), Signlessness (*animitta*), and Wishlessness (*apraṇihita*).

[^f1p2-4]: "Open, reveal, awaken to, and enter" (開示悟入) are the famous four verbs from *Lotus Sūtra* Chapter 2, describing the Buddha's purpose for appearing in the world.

[^f1p2-5]: **Three Truths** (三諦): Emptiness (*kōng* 空), Provisional Existence (*jiǎ* 假), and the Middle (*zhōng* 中). This is the cardinal doctrine of Tiantai.

[^f1p2-6]: *Lotus Sūtra*, Chapter 2 ("Skillful Means").

[^f1p2-7]: *Lotus Sūtra*, Chapter 2.

[^f1p2-8]: This is a classic Tiantai doctrinal schema summarizing the Buddha's teaching career: *Avataṃsaka* includes the One Vehicle alongside the separate vehicles; *Tripiṭaka* teaches only the separate vehicles; *Vaipulya* contrasts Great and Small Vehicles; *Prajñā* carries the Three Vehicles while gradually revealing the One.

[^f1p2-9]: *Lotus Sūtra*, Chapter 16 ("The Lifespan of the Tathāgata").

[^f1p2-10]: "Three kinds of Provisional-and-Real dual wisdom" refers to: (1) wisdom of self-practice, (2) wisdom for transforming others, and (3) the unity of both.

[^f1p2-11]: The **Five Flavors** (五味) represent the Buddha's teaching career as progressive stages of refinement, like the production of ghee from milk: Milk (乳) → Curds (酪) → Fresh Butter (生蘇) → Clarified Butter (熟蘇) → Ghee (醍醐). This schema comes from the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*.

[^f1p2-12]: **Ghee** (醍醐, *tíhú*): The final, most refined product in the Five Flavors schema—representing the *Lotus Sūtra* as the ultimate, integrative teaching.


## Part 3: The Seven Shared Interpretations (Sections 2–7)

### Section 2: Citing Evidence (引證)

#### Scriptural Evidence for the Name

如文殊答問偈云「我見燈明佛，本光瑞如此，以是知今佛，欲說《法華經》」。

> As Mañjuśrī replied in verse: "I saw the Buddha Lamp-Bright; the original auspicious light was just like this. From this I know the present Buddha intends to teach the *Lotus Sūtra*."[^f1p3-1]

何但二萬億？大通智勝及五佛章中三世佛說，皆名「法華」也。

> Not only the two hundred trillion [Buddhas of the Lamp-Bright lineage]—the Great Pervasive Wisdom Excellence Buddha and the Three-World Buddhas in the Five Buddha Chapters—all taught what is named "Lotus."

文云「今佛放光明，助發實相義」，又云「諸法實相義，已為汝等說」，又云「無量眾所尊，為說實相印」。

> The text says: "Now the Buddha emits radiance to assist in revealing the meaning of true reality." And: "The meaning of the true reality of all dharmas has already been taught to you." And: "The one honored by immeasurable beings teaches the Real-Mark Seal."

此亦今古同以實相為體也。

> This also shows that past and present [Buddhas] alike take True Reality as the Substance.

#### Scriptural Evidence for Essence and Function

文云「佛當雨法雨，充足求道者」，即是會三歸一之法雨，令求佛道因者充足，乃至一切皆會令充足。

> The text says: "The Buddha shall rain the Dharma rain, fulfilling those who seek the Way." This is the Dharma rain that integrates the Three into the One, causing those who seek the Buddha Way as *cause* to be fulfilled, and indeed causing all to be integrated and fulfilled.

若開近顯遠之法雨，令求佛道果者充足。

> If it is the Dharma rain that opens the near to reveal the remote, it causes those who seek the Buddha Way as *fruit* to be fulfilled.

文云「諸求三乘人，若有疑悔者，佛當為除斷，令盡無有餘」，又云「諸佛法久後，要當說真實」，即是斷三乘、五乘、七方便、九法界等疑，皆令生信。

> The text says: "Those seeking the Three Vehicles, if any have doubts or regrets, the Buddha shall eliminate them entirely, leaving nothing remaining." And: "The Dharma of all Buddhas, after a long time, must finally speak the truth." This is the elimination of doubts about the Three Vehicles, Five Vehicles, Seven Expedients, and Nine Dharma-Realms, causing all to give rise to faith.

此證經用也。

> This is evidence for the sūtra's Function.

#### The "Supernatural Powers" Chapter Evidence

又〈如來神力品〉云「以要言之，如來一切所有之法，如來一切自在神力，如來一切祕要之藏，如來一切甚深之事，皆於此經宣示顯說」。

> The "Supernatural Powers of the Tathāgata" chapter says: "To speak in summary: all the Dharmas of the Tathāgata, all the sovereign supernatural powers of the Tathāgata, all the secret essential treasury of the Tathāgata, all the profound matters of the Tathāgata—all are proclaimed and revealed in this sūtra."[^f1p3-2]

一切法者，權實一切法皆攝也，此證經名。

> "All Dharmas" means all Dharmas, both Provisional and Real, are included—this is evidence for the sūtra's **Name**.

一切自在神力者，內用名自在，外用名神力，即證用也。

> "All sovereign supernatural powers"—inner functioning is called sovereignty, outer functioning is called supernatural power—this is evidence for the **Function**.

一切祕要之藏者，非器莫授為祕，正體為要，多所含容而無積聚名藏，此證體也。

> "All the secret essential treasury"—not to grant to the unworthy vessel is called secret; the correct Substance is called essential; containing much yet without accumulation is called treasury—this is evidence for the **Substance**.

一切甚深之事者，實相名甚深，為實相修因名深因，究竟實相名深果。

> "All profound matters"—True Reality is called profound; cultivating causes for True Reality is called profound cause; ultimate True Reality is called profound fruit.

#### The "Dharma Teacher" Chapter Evidence

又〈法師品〉云「若聞此經，乃是善行菩薩之道」，深因也。

> The "Dharma Teacher" chapter says: "If one hears this sūtra, this is the good practice of the bodhisattva path"—the profound cause.

「求佛道者，咸於我前聞《妙法華經》一句，乃至一念隨喜，我皆與授記。乃至須臾聞之，即得究竟三菩提深果。」

> "Those who seek the Buddha Way, who before me have heard even one phrase of the *Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sūtra*, or even given rise to a single thought of rejoicing—I give them all prediction [of Buddhahood]. Even those who hear it for just a moment immediately attain the profound fruit of ultimate *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*."[^f1p3-3]

此證宗也。

> This is evidence for the **Essence**.

#### The Six Similes from the "Medicine King" Chapter

又〈藥王品〉舉十譬歎教，今引其六：大如海，高如山，圓如月，照如日，自在如梵王、極如佛。

> The "Medicine King" chapter presents ten similes praising this Teaching. Now we cite six: **Great as the ocean**, **High as the mountain**, **Round as the moon**, **Brilliant as the sun**, **Sovereign as Brahma**, **Ultimate as Buddha**.

**1. Great as the Ocean (大如海)**

海是坎德，萬流歸故，同一鹹故。《法華》亦爾，佛所證得，萬善同歸，同乘佛乘。

> The ocean has the virtue of receiving—all streams return to it; all share the same saltiness. The *Lotus Sūtra* is likewise: what the Buddha has realized, the ten thousand goods return to, all riding the One Buddha Vehicle.

江湖川流，無此大德，餘經亦爾，故《法華》最大也。

> Rivers and lakes do not have this great virtue; other sūtras are the same. Therefore the *Lotus* is the greatest.

**2. High as the Mountain (高如山)**

山王最高，四寶所成故，純諸天居故。《法華》亦爾，在四味教之頂，離四誹謗，開、示、悟、入，純一根一緣，同一道味，純是菩薩，無聲聞弟子故。

> The Mountain King (Mount Sumeru) is highest, formed of four treasures, where only devas dwell. The *Lotus* is likewise: at the summit of the Four Flavor Teachings, free from the four slanders,[^f1p3-4] opening, revealing, awakening, and entering—purely one root, one condition, one flavor of the Way—purely bodhisattvas, with no śrāvaka disciples.

**3. Round as the Moon (圓如月)**

月能虧盈故，月漸圓故。《法華》亦爾，同體權實故，會漸入頓故。

> The moon can wax and wane; the moon gradually becomes full. The *Lotus* is likewise: the Provisional and Real share one substance; the gradual is integrated into the sudden.

**4. Brilliant as the Sun (照如日)**

燈、炬、星、月與闇共住，譬諸經存二乘道果，與小並立，日能破闇故。

> Lamps, torches, stars, and moon coexist with darkness—this metaphors how other sūtras preserve the Two Vehicle paths and fruits, allowing the small to stand alongside. The sun can destroy darkness.

《法華》破化城，除草庵故。又日映奪星月，令不現故。《法華》拂迹，除方便故。

> The *Lotus* destroys the Conjured City and removes the Grass Hut. The sun outshines stars and moon, making them invisible. The *Lotus* removes the traces and dispenses with skillful means.

**5. Sovereign as Brahma (自在如梵王)**

輪王於四域自在，釋王於三十三天自在，大梵於三界自在。諸經或於俗諦自在，或於真諦自在，或於中道自在；但是歷別自在，非大自在。

> A wheel-turning king is sovereign over the four continents; Śakra is sovereign over the Thirty-Three Heavens; Great Brahma is sovereign over the Three Realms. Other sūtras may be sovereign in conventional truth, or in ultimate truth, or in the Middle Way—but these are all separate sovereignties, not great sovereignty.

今經三諦圓融，最得自在，譬大梵王。

> This present sūtra's Three Truths are perfectly interfused, achieving the greatest sovereignty—metaphorically, the Great Brahma King.

**6. Ultimate as Buddha (極如佛)**

餘經拔眾生出生死，如五佛子，於凡夫第一。或拔眾生出涅槃，如菩薩居無學上。今經拔出眾生，過方便教菩薩上，即成法王，最為第一。

> Other sūtras deliver beings from birth-and-death, like the Five Buddha Sons, who are first among ordinary beings. Or they deliver beings from nirvāṇa, like bodhisattvas who dwell above the non-learners. This present sūtra delivers beings beyond the bodhisattvas of the expedient teachings, immediately becoming Dharma Kings—the ultimate first.

### Section 3: Demonstrating the Arising (生起)

能生為生，所生為起。前後有次第，麁細不相違。

> "That which generates" is called *arising*; "that which is generated" is called *starting*. There is a sequence from before to after; coarse and subtle do not conflict.

肇云：「名無召物之功，物無應名之實。無名無物，名、物安在？」蓋第一義中無相意耳。

> [Sēng]zhào said: "Names have no power to summon things; things have no reality to respond to names. If there are no names and no things, where are names and things?" This is the meaning of no-marks in the first principle.

世諦為言，無名無以顯法，故初釋名。名，名於法，法即是體，尋名識體；體非宗不會，會體自行已圓，從體起用，導利含識；利益既多，須分別教相也。

> Speaking in terms of conventional truth: without names, there is no way to reveal the Dharma—hence we first interpret the Name. Names designate the Dharma; the Dharma is the Substance. Following names, we recognize the Substance. The Substance cannot be integrated without the Essence. Integrating the Substance, self-practice is already complete. From the Substance arises Function, guiding and benefiting sentient beings. Since the benefits are many, we must distinguish the Teaching Classification.

#### The Arising According to "Open, Reveal, Awaken, Enter"

開、示、悟、入，亦約行次第，法本無開閉，今呼為方便門開，此聞名也。示真實相，體也。自迷得悟，悟因也。由因故悟果，宗也。悟故深入，亦令他入，用也。分別同異，教也。

> "Open, reveal, awaken, enter"—this also follows the sequence of practice. The Dharma originally has neither opening nor closing; now we call it "opening the gate of skillful means"—this is hearing the **Name**. "Revealing the marks of true reality"—the **Substance**. "Being confused yet attaining awakening"—awakening to the **cause**. "Due to cause, awakening to fruit"—the **Essence**. "Awakening, one deeply enters and causes others to enter"—the **Function**. "Distinguishing sameness and difference"—the **Teaching**.

今之五義，依〈序品〉扶行次第也。

> These five meanings follow the sequence of practice supported by the "Introduction" chapter.

### Section 4: Opening and Combining (開合)

五章共釋一經，種種分別，令易解故。凡三種開合，謂五種、十種、譬喻。

> The Five Chapters together interpret one sūtra. Various distinctions are made for ease of understanding. There are three kinds of opening and combining: the five kinds, the ten kinds, and simile.

#### The Five-Kind Opening

初、釋名通論事、理，顯體專論理，宗、用但論事，教相分別事、理。

> First: Interpreting the Name discusses both phenomena and principle. Discerning the Substance discusses only principle. Essence and Function discuss only phenomena. Teaching Classification distinguishes phenomena and principle.

釋名通說教行，顯體非教、非行，宗、用但行，教相但教。

> Interpreting the Name discusses both teaching and practice. Discerning the Substance is neither teaching nor practice. Essence and Function are only practice. Teaching Classification is only teaching.

釋名通說因果，顯體非因、非果，宗自因果，用教他因果，教相分別上法耳。

> Interpreting the Name discusses both cause and effect. Discerning the Substance is neither cause nor effect. Essence is self-practice cause-and-effect. Function teaches others cause-and-effect. Teaching Classification distinguishes the above dharmas.

#### The Simile: The Human Body

譬喻者，譬如總名人身，開身則有識、命、煖，分別諸身貴、賤、賢、愚，種種差降。人身譬名，識以譬體，命以譬宗，煖以譬用，分別譬教相(云云)。

> **Simile**: It is like the general designation "human body." Opening the body, there are consciousness, life, and warmth; distinguishing various bodies—noble or base, wise or foolish—there are various gradations. The **human body** metaphors the **Name**. **Consciousness** metaphors the **Substance**. **Life** metaphors the **Essence**. **Warmth** metaphors the **Function**. **Distinguishing** metaphors the **Teaching Classification**.

### Section 5: Critical Discrimination (料簡)

This section presents a series of questions and answers addressing potential objections.

#### Q1: Doesn't "flower for the lotus" imply cause contains effect?

問：若為蓮故華，華果必俱，將不墮因中有果耶？

> **Q:** If "the flower exists for the sake of the lotus" and flower and fruit necessarily coexist, doesn't this fall into [the Sāṃkhya heresy of] "effect within cause"?

答：因中有果，舊醫邪法，已為初教所破，尚非麁權實義，況是妙因妙果、新醫真乳法邪？

> **A:** "Effect within cause" is the old physician's heretical doctrine, already refuted by the initial teaching. It is not even the coarse meaning of Provisional and Real—how much less the wonderful cause and wonderful fruit of the new physician's true milk Dharma!

#### Q2: If the flower metaphors the Provisional, why destroy the Grass Hut?

問：華以喻權，權是小乘之法，則不應破於草庵。草庵既破，何得以華喻權？

> **Q:** If the flower metaphors the Provisional, and the Provisional is the Small Vehicle dharma, then it should not destroy the Grass Hut. Since the Grass Hut is destroyed, how can the flower metaphor the Provisional?

答：小乘是化他之權，是故須破。今明自行之權，故以華喻耳。

> **A:** The Small Vehicle is the **expedient for transforming others**—therefore it must be destroyed. Now we clarify the **expedient of self-practice**—hence the flower is used as metaphor.

#### Q3: Why five chapters, not four or six?

問：何故五章，不四不六？

> **Q:** Why five chapters, not four or six?

答：設作四六，亦復生疑，墮無窮問，非也。

> **A:** If we made it four or six, doubt would likewise arise, falling into infinite questioning. This is not [the point].

### Section 6: Observing the Mind (觀心)

This is the practical core of the Seven Interpretations—transforming doctrine into meditation.

#### The Mind and the Title

心如幻焰，但有名字，名之為心。適言其有，不見色質；適言其無，復起慮想。不可以有、無思度故，故名心為「妙」。

> The mind is like a magical flame—it merely has a name; it is called "mind." Just when you say it exists, you don't see its form or substance. Just when you say it doesn't exist, thoughts arise again. Because it cannot be measured by existence or non-existence, the mind is called **"Wonderful"** (妙).

妙心可軌，稱之為「法」。

> The wonderful mind can be a guiding standard—it is called **"Dharma"** (法).

心法非因、非果，能如理觀，即辦因果，是名「蓮華」。

> The dharma of mind is neither cause nor effect; yet when contemplated in accord with principle, it accomplishes cause and effect—this is called **"Lotus Flower"** (蓮華).

由一心成觀，亦轉教餘心，名之為「經」。

> Through one mind, contemplation is accomplished, and it transforms to teach other minds—this is called **"Sūtra"** (經).

釋名竟。

> This completes the interpretation of the Name.

#### The Mind as Substance, Essence, Function

心本無名，亦無無名。心名不生，亦復不滅，心即實相。

> The mind originally has no name, nor is it "no-name." The name of mind is not arising, nor is it ceasing. **The mind is True Reality.**

初觀為因，觀成為果。

> Initial contemplation is **cause**; accomplished contemplation is **fruit**.

以觀心故，惡覺不起。心數塵勞，若同若異，皆被化而轉，是為觀心。

> Because of contemplating the mind, evil thoughts do not arise. The mental factors and afflictions, whether same or different, are all transformed—this is contemplating the mind.

#### The Six Stages of Identity (六即)

若欲免貧窮，當勤三觀；欲免上慢，當聞六即。

> If you wish to escape poverty, you must diligently [practice] the Three Contemplations. If you wish to escape arrogance, you must hear [of] the Six Stages of Identity.[^f1p3-5]

世間相常住，理即也。

> "The worldly marks are eternally abiding"—this is **Identity in Principle** (理即).

於諸過去佛，若有聞一句，名字即也。

> "If regarding all past Buddhas, one has heard even a single phrase"—this is **Identity in Name** (名字即).

深信隨喜，觀行即也。

> "Deep faith and rejoicing"—this is **Identity in Contemplative Practice** (觀行即).

六根清淨，相似即也。

> "Six sense faculties purified"—this is **Identity in Resemblance** (相似即).

安住實智中，分證即也。

> "Abiding in real wisdom"—this is **Identity in Partial Realization** (分證即).

唯佛與佛究盡實相，究竟即也。

> "Only a Buddha and a Buddha can fathom the reality of all dharmas"—this is **Identity in Ultimate Realization** (究竟即).

#### The Balance of Study and Practice

《華嚴》云「譬如貧窮人，日夜數他寶，自無半錢分」，偏聞之失也。

> The *Avataṃsaka* says: "Like a poor person who day and night counts others' treasures yet has not half a coin"—this is the fault of **one-sided study**.

下文云「未得謂得，未證謂證」，偏觀之失也。

> The text below says: "Claiming attainment without attainment, claiming realization without realization"—this is the fault of **one-sided meditation**.

若欲免貧窮，當勤三觀；欲免上慢，當聞六即。

> If you wish to escape poverty, diligently practice the Three Contemplations. If you wish to escape arrogance, learn of the Six Stages.

修心內觀，則有法財；正信外聞，無復上慢。眼慧明聞，具足利益，何得不觀解耶？

> Cultivating inner contemplation of mind, one has Dharma wealth. With correct faith and external hearing, there is no more arrogance. With the eye of wisdom illuminating what is heard, one fully benefits. How could one not contemplate and understand?

### Section 7: Reconciling Differences (會異)

This section harmonizes the Five-Chapter system with the Four Siddhāntas.

#### The Four Siddhāntas and the Five Chapters

問：佛有所說，依四悉檀。今解五義，與彼會不？

> **Q:** The Buddha's teaching depends on the Four Siddhāntas. Does our present interpretation of the Five Meanings accord with those?

答：此義今當說，先對五章，次解四悉檀。

> **A:** This meaning shall now be explained. First, we correlate [the Four Siddhāntas] with the Five Chapters; next, we explain the Four Siddhāntas.

世界悉檀對釋名。名該一部，世界亦冠於三。

> **Worldly Siddhānta** corresponds to **Interpreting the Name**. The Name encompasses the entire text; the Worldly likewise crowns the [other] three.

第一義對體，最分明。

> **First-Principle Siddhānta** corresponds to **Substance**—this is most clear.

為人對宗，宗論因果，為人生善，義同。

> **For-Each-Person Siddhānta** corresponds to **Essence**. The Essence discusses cause and effect; "For Each Person" generates good—the meaning is the same.

對治對用，用破疑滯，與治病事齊。

> **Therapeutic Siddhānta** corresponds to **Function**. Function breaks through doubt and stagnation; treating illness is its equivalent.

分別悉檀對教相，教相如後說。

> **Distinguishing Siddhānta** corresponds to **Teaching Classification**, as explained later.

#### What Are the Four Siddhāntas?

南岳師，例「大涅槃」，梵、漢兼稱。「悉」是此言，「檀」是梵語，悉之言遍，檀翻為施。佛以四法，遍施眾生，故言悉檀也。

> Master Nanyue, following the example of "*Mahāparinirvāṇa*," used both Sanskrit and Chinese together. "Xī" (悉) is Chinese [meaning "universal"]; "tán" (檀) is Sanskrit [*dāna*, meaning "giving"]. "Xī" means "universally"; "tán" translates as "giving." The Buddha universally gives four dharmas to sentient beings—hence the term *siddhānta* (悉檀).

**1. Worldly Siddhānta (世界悉檀)**

世界如車，輪、輻、軸、輞和合故有車，無別車也。五眾和合故有人，無別人也。

> The world is like a cart: wheels, spokes, axle, and rim combine to give rise to "cart"—there is no separate cart. The five aggregates combine to give rise to "person"—there is no separate person.

有於五陰、十二入、十八界，一切名相隔別，名為世界。

> The existence of the five aggregates, twelve bases, and eighteen realms, with all their names and marks separately distinguished—this is called "world."

大聖隨順眾生所欲樂聞，分別為說正因緣世界法，令得世間正見，是名世界悉檀相。

> The Great Sage, following what sentient beings delight to hear, distinctly teaches the Dharma of correct causation and world—enabling them to gain correct worldly views. This is the mark of the Worldly Siddhānta.

**2. For-Each-Person Siddhānta (為人悉檀)**

大聖觀人心而為說法，人心各各不同，於一事中或聽或不聽。

> The Great Sage observes people's minds and teaches accordingly. People's minds differ; regarding one matter, some listen and some do not.

此意傍為破執，正是生信。增長善根，施其善法也。故名各各為人悉檀。

> The secondary purpose is to break attachments; the primary purpose is to generate faith, increase good roots, and bestow wholesome dharmas. Hence it is called the "For Each Person" Siddhānta.

**3. Therapeutic Siddhānta (對治悉檀)**

有法對治則有、實性則無。對治者：貪欲多，教觀不淨；瞋恚多，教修慈心；愚癡多，教觀因緣。

> There are dharmas that exist as treatment but have no inherent nature. Treatment means: for excessive greed, teach contemplation of impurity; for excessive anger, teach cultivation of loving-kindness; for excessive delusion, teach contemplation of causation.

對治惡病，說此法藥，遍施眾生，故名對治悉檀相也。

> Treating evil diseases, teaching this Dharma medicine, universally giving to sentient beings—this is the mark of the Therapeutic Siddhānta.

**4. First-Principle Siddhānta (第一義悉檀)**

有二種：一、不可說；二、可說。

> There are two kinds: (1) the inexpressible; (2) the expressible.

不可說者，即是諸佛、辟支佛、羅漢所得真實法。引偈云：「言論盡竟，心行亦訖，不生不滅，法如涅槃。」

> The inexpressible is what all Buddhas, pratyekabuddhas, and arhats realize as true reality. A verse says: "Speech and discourse come to an end; mental activity also ceases. Neither arising nor ceasing—the Dharma is like nirvāṇa."

說諸行處，名世界；說不行處，名第一義。

> Teaching where activities proceed is called "world." Teaching where [activities] do not proceed is called "First Principle."

約可說者，一切實、一切不實、一切亦實亦不實、一切非實非不實，皆名諸法之實相。

> Regarding the expressible: "All is real," "All is unreal," "All is both real and unreal," "All is neither real nor unreal"—these are all names for the True Mark of all dharmas.[^f1p3-6]

故《中論》云：「為向道人說四句，如快馬見鞭影即入正路。」

> Therefore the *Madhyamaka-śāstra* says: "For one who is heading toward the Way, explain the four phrases; like a swift horse seeing the shadow of the whip, they immediately enter the correct path."

若聞四句，心生取著，皆是戲論，豈第一義耶？

> But if upon hearing the four phrases, the mind gives rise to grasping—this is all idle talk. How is this the First Principle?

### Footnotes (Part 3)

[^f1p3-1]: *Lotus Sūtra*, Chapter 1 ("Introduction"). Mañjuśrī recounts having witnessed the same auspicious signs under Buddha Lamp-Bright (Dīpaṃkara).

[^f1p3-2]: *Lotus Sūtra*, Chapter 21 ("Supernatural Powers of the Tathāgata").

[^f1p3-3]: *Lotus Sūtra*, Chapter 10 ("Dharma Teacher").

[^f1p3-4]: The **four slanders** (四誹謗): (1) slandering the Buddha, (2) slandering the Dharma, (3) slandering the Saṅgha, (4) slandering those who practice.

[^f1p3-5]: The **Six Stages of Identity** (六即) are a cardinal Tiantai doctrine, showing how Buddhahood is already present but realized progressively: (1) Identity in Principle—Buddhahood is inherently present; (2) Identity in Name—one has heard the teaching; (3) Identity in Contemplative Practice—one is practicing; (4) Identity in Resemblance—preliminary realization; (5) Identity in Partial Realization—bodhisattva stages; (6) Identity in Ultimate Realization—full Buddhahood.

[^f1p3-6]: This is the famous *catuṣkoṭi* (tetralemma) of Mādhyamika logic, used by Nāgārjuna: (1) X, (2) not-X, (3) both X and not-X, (4) neither X nor not-X. All four can be skillfully employed to point toward True Reality.

## Part 4: The Four Siddhāntas Detailed (Ten Methods)

### The Four Siddhāntas Explained in Ten Methods

Master Zhiyi presents a comprehensive analysis of the Four Siddhāntas through ten methodological lenses:

> 一、釋名　二、辨相　三、釋成　四、對諦　五、起教觀　六、說默　七、用不用　八、權實　九、開顯　十、通經

1. **Explaining the Names** (釋名)
2. **Distinguishing the Marks** (辨相)
3. **Interpreting the Establishment** (釋成)
4. **Correlating with the Truths** (對諦)
5. **Generating Contemplation and Teaching** (起教觀)
6. **Holy Speech and Holy Silence** (說默)
7. **Application and Non-Application** (用不用)
8. **Provisional and Real** (權實)
9. **Opening the Provisional to Reveal the Real** (開顯)
10. **Connecting with the Sūtra** (通經)

### Section 4: Correlating with the Four Noble Truths

四、對諦者，直對一番四諦，如前說。

> **Correlating with the Truths:** Directly correlating one set of Four Noble Truths, as previously explained.

廣對四種四諦者，四種四諦，一一以四悉檀對之。

> More extensively correlating the Four Kinds of Four Noble Truths: each of the four kinds is correlated with the Four Siddhāntas.

復總對者，生滅四諦對世界，無生四諦對為人，無量四諦對對治，無作四諦對第一義。

> In summary correlation:
> - **Arising-and-Ceasing Four Truths** correspond to the **Worldly Siddhānta**
> - **Non-Arising Four Truths** correspond to the **For-Each-Person Siddhānta**
> - **Immeasurable Four Truths** correspond to the **Therapeutic Siddhānta**
> - **Non-Created Four Truths** correspond to the **First-Principle Siddhānta**[^f1p4-1]

### Section 5: Generating Contemplation and Teaching

#### Contemplation Arises Through the Siddhāntas

幽微之理，非觀不明；契理之觀，非悉檀不起。

> Profound and subtle principle cannot be illuminated without contemplation. Contemplation that accords with principle cannot arise without the Siddhāntas.

脩從假入空觀時，先觀正因緣法。

> When cultivating the contemplation of **entering emptiness from the provisional**, first contemplate the dharmas of correct dependent origination.

此法內、外、親、疎隔別，若不殷勤、樂欲，則所習不成，必須曉夜精勤、欣悅、無懈，此即世界悉檀起初觀也。

> These dharmas—inner and outer, intimate and distant—are separately distinguished. If there is no earnestness and delight, the practice will not succeed. One must diligently strive day and night with joy and without laxity. **This is the Worldly Siddhānta generating initial contemplation.**

若欲觀假入空，須識為人便宜...是為隨宜，善心則發。

> If one wishes to contemplate entering emptiness from the provisional, one must recognize what is expedient for each person... This is following what is appropriate; the wholesome mind then arises.

若有沈、浮之病，須用對治悉檀。若心沈時，念、擇、進、喜治之。若心浮時，念、捨、除、定治之。

> If there is the disease of **sinking** or **floating**, one must use the **Therapeutic Siddhānta**:
> - When the mind **sinks**: treat with mindfulness, discrimination, vigor, and joy.
> - When the mind **floats**: treat with mindfulness, equanimity, exclusion, and concentration.[^f1p4-2]

若善用為人，善根則厚。若善用對治，煩惱則薄。

> If one skillfully employs [the For-Each-Person Siddhānta], good roots become thick. If one skillfully employs the Therapeutic [Siddhānta], afflictions become thin.

於七覺中，隨依一覺，怳然如失。即依此覺分研修，能發真明，見第一義。

> Among the Seven Factors of Awakening, following one factor, suddenly [insight arises] as if lost [to ordinary awareness]. Relying on this factor of awakening for research and cultivation, one can generate true illumination and see the First Principle.

是為用四悉檀，起從假入空觀，成一切智，發慧眼也。

> **This is using the Four Siddhāntas to generate the contemplation of entering emptiness from the provisional, accomplishing all-knowledge, and opening the Wisdom Eye.**

若從空入假觀，巧用四悉檀，取道種智，法眼亦如是。

> If [cultivating] the contemplation of **entering the provisional from emptiness**, skillfully employ the Four Siddhāntas to attain Path-Knowledge—the Dharma Eye is likewise.

若修中道第一義觀，巧用四悉檀，取一切種智，佛眼亦如是。

> If cultivating the **Middle Way First-Principle Contemplation**, skillfully employ the Four Siddhāntas to attain All-Mode-Knowledge—the Buddha Eye is likewise.

若一心三觀，巧用亦如是。

> If [practicing] **Three Contemplations in One Mind**, the skillful application is likewise.

#### Teaching Arises Through the Siddhāntas

起教者，《大論》云：「佛常樂默然，不樂說法。」《淨名》亦論杜口。此經云：「不可以言宣」。

> **Generating Teaching:** The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* says: "The Buddha constantly delights in silence; he does not delight in teaching the Dharma." The *Vimalakīrti* also discusses closing the mouth. This sūtra says: "It cannot be proclaimed with words."

《大經》云：「生生不可說，乃至不生不生不可說」，又云：「亦可得說」。

> The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "The arising of arising cannot be spoken... down to the non-arising of non-arising cannot be spoken." Yet it also says: "It can also be spoken."

若十因緣法所成眾生有下品樂欲，能生界內事善，拙度破惑，析法入空；具此因緣者，如來則轉生滅四諦法輪，起三藏教也。

> If sentient beings formed by the ten-factor dependent origination have **lower-grade delight**, able to generate phenomenal good within the realms, with crude methods breaking delusion and analyzing dharmas to enter emptiness—for those possessing these conditions, the Tathāgata turns the Dharma Wheel of the **Arising-and-Ceasing Four Truths**, generating the **Tripiṭaka Teaching**.

若十因緣法所成眾生有中品樂欲...如來則轉無生四諦法輪，起通教也。

> If sentient beings have **middle-grade delight**... the Tathāgata turns the Dharma Wheel of the **Non-Arising Four Truths**, generating the **Common Teaching**.

若十因緣所成眾生有上品樂欲...如來則轉無量四諦法輪，起別教也。

> If sentient beings have **upper-grade delight**... the Tathāgata turns the Dharma Wheel of the **Immeasurable Four Truths**, generating the **Distinct Teaching**.

若十因緣所成眾生有上上品樂欲...如來則轉無作四諦法輪，起圓教也。

> If sentient beings have **highest-grade delight**... the Tathāgata turns the Dharma Wheel of the **Non-Created Four Truths**, generating the **Perfect Teaching**.

### Section 6: Holy Speech and Holy Silence

《思益》云：「佛告諸比丘：汝等當行二事，若聖說法、若聖默然。」

> The *Suvikrāntavikrāmi-paripṛcchā* says: "The Buddha told the monks: 'You should practice two things—either holy speech of Dharma, or holy silence.'"

聖說如上辨。聖默然者，夫四種四諦並是三乘聖人所證之法，非下凡所知，故不可說；假令說之，如為盲人設燭，何益無目者乎！

> Holy speech has been explained above. **Holy silence**: The four kinds of Four Noble Truths are all dharmas realized by the Three Vehicle sages, not known by lower ordinary beings. Therefore they cannot be spoken. Even if spoken, it is like setting up a candle for blind people—what benefit is there for those without eyes?

故不可說，名聖默然。

> Therefore, since it cannot be spoken, it is called **holy silence**.

#### Forms of Holy Silence in Each Teaching

華嚴中數世界，不可說、不可說，明理極不可說、不可說。

> In the *Avataṃsaka*, counting worlds—unspeakable, unspeakable—clarifies that principle at its ultimate is unspeakable, unspeakable.

若三藏中，憍陳如比丘最初獲得真實之知見，寂然無聲字。

> In the *Tripiṭaka*, the monk Kauṇḍinya first attained true knowledge and vision—silent, without sound or letters.

身子云：「吾聞解脫之中，無有言說者。」是約生滅四諦生生之法，明不可說。

> Śāriputra said: "I have heard that within liberation, there is no verbal expression." This clarifies, based on the Arising-and-Ceasing Four Truths of the arising-of-arising dharmas, that [it] cannot be spoken.

《淨名》杜口，《大集》無言菩薩...言語道斷，心行亦訖，不生不滅，法如涅槃。

> In the *Vimalakīrti*, [he] shuts his mouth. In the *Mahāsaṃnipāta*, the Bodhisattva of No Speech... "The path of speech is cut off; mental activity also ceases. Neither arising nor ceasing—the Dharma is like nirvāṇa."

此經明「止止不須說，我法妙難思」；「是法不可示，言辭相寂滅」，不可以言宣，非思量分別之所能解。

> This sūtra clarifies: "**Stop, stop—no need to speak. My Dharma is wonderful and hard to conceive.**" "**This Dharma cannot be shown; the marks of speech are extinguished.**" It cannot be proclaimed with words; it is not something that thought or discrimination can comprehend.

此約無作四諦，不生不生法，明不可說。不可說故，名聖默然。

> This clarifies, based on the Non-Created Four Truths of non-arising-of-non-arising dharmas, that [it] cannot be spoken. Because it cannot be spoken, it is called **holy silence**.

### Section 7: Application and Non-Application

夫四悉檀獨有如來究竟具得，微妙能用。下地已去，得、用不同，凡有四句：

> The Four Siddhāntas—only the Tathāgata has completely and ultimately attained them and can subtly employ them. From lower stages onward, attainment and application differ. There are four possibilities:

1. **不得不用** — Not attaining, not applying
2. **得而不用** — Attaining but not applying
3. **不得而用** — Not attaining yet applying
4. **亦得亦用** — Both attaining and applying

#### Who Falls into Each Category

凡夫外道苦集流轉，尚不能知四悉檀名字，誰論其得？既其不得，云何能用也！

> Ordinary beings and non-Buddhists revolve in suffering and accumulation—they cannot even know the names of the Four Siddhāntas. Who speaks of their attainment? Since they do not attain, how can they apply?

若三藏教二乘殷勤自行者，知苦、斷集、修道、證滅、入真，亦名為得。不度眾生，故不能用。

> If the Two Vehicles of the Tripiṭaka Teaching diligently practice themselves—knowing suffering, cutting off accumulation, cultivating the path, realizing cessation, entering truth—this is also called **attainment**. But they do not ferry sentient beings, so they **cannot apply**.

假令用者，差機不當...

> If they were to apply, they would misjudge capacities...

如富樓那九旬化外道，反被蚩笑！文殊暫往，師徒皆伏。此是不知樂欲，不能用世界悉檀也。

> Like Pūrṇa, who for ninety days tried to convert the non-Buddhists but was instead ridiculed! When Mañjuśrī briefly went, both teacher and disciples submitted. **This is not knowing delight—being unable to use the Worldly Siddhānta.**

如身子教二弟子，善根不發，更生邪疑，此不能用為人悉檀也。

> Like Śāriputra teaching two disciples—good roots did not arise; instead, wrong doubts increased. **This is being unable to use the For-Each-Person Siddhānta.**

如五百羅漢為迦絺那說四諦，都無利益；佛為說不淨觀，即得破惡。此不能用對治悉檀也。

> Like the five hundred arhats teaching the Four Truths to Kātyāyana—there was no benefit at all. The Buddha taught him the impurity contemplation, and immediately evil was broken. **This is being unable to use the Therapeutic Siddhānta.**

如身子不度福增，大醫不治，小醫拱手，五百皆不度，佛度即得羅漢，此不能用第一義悉檀也。

> Like Śāriputra not ferrying Puṇyavardhana—the great physician did not treat; the small physicians folded their hands. The five hundred all failed to ferry him; the Buddha ferried him and immediately he attained arhatship. **This is being unable to use the First-Principle Siddhānta.**

#### Progression Through the Teachings

若別教十住，但得析法、體法兩種四悉檀，而未能用；十行方能用；十迴向進得相似四悉檀，亦能相似用；登地分真得，亦分真用。

> In the Distinct Teaching at the Ten Abidings, one only attains the two kinds—analytic and embodied—of Four Siddhāntas, but cannot yet apply them. At the Ten Practices, one can apply. At the Ten Dedications, one progressively attains the resemblance Four Siddhāntas and can also apply in resemblance. Entering the Stages, one partially-truly attains and partially-truly applies.

圓教五品弟子，未能得用；六根清淨，相似得用；初住分真，得用也；唯佛究竟得、究竟用。

> In the Perfect Teaching, disciples at the Five Stages of Discipleship cannot yet attain or apply. At the Purification of the Six Senses, one attains and applies in resemblance. At the First Abiding, one partially-truly attains and applies. **Only the Buddha ultimately attains and ultimately applies.**

### Section 8: Provisional and Real

四諦各辨四悉檀者，此通途說耳。

> **Provisional and Real:** That each of the Four Noble Truths distinguishes Four Siddhāntas—this is the general approach.

《釋論》云：「諸經多說三悉檀，不說第一義」者，此指三藏。

> The *Śāstra* says: "Many sūtras speak of three Siddhāntas, not speaking of the First Principle"—this refers to the Tripiṭaka.

雖爾，終是拙度，權逗小機也。

> Even so, this is ultimately a crude method, **provisionally matching lesser capacities**.

若通教四諦明四悉檀，體法即真，其門則巧故...猶屬權也。

> If the Common Teaching's Four Truths clarify the Four Siddhāntas, embodying dharmas as directly true—the gate is skillful, yet... **it still belongs to the Provisional**.

若別教四諦明四悉檀，約於中道，此意則深；而猶是歷別，別相未融，教道是權，此則非妙。

> If the Distinct Teaching's Four Truths clarify the Four Siddhāntas, based on the Middle Way—this meaning is deep. Yet it is still sequential; distinct marks are not yet fused. The teaching-path is Provisional—**this is not yet Wonderful**.

今圓教四諦明四悉檀，其相圓融，最實之說。故四悉檀，是實、是妙。

> Now, the Perfect Teaching's Four Truths clarifying the Four Siddhāntas—their marks are perfectly fused. This is the **most Real explanation**. Therefore the Four Siddhāntas are **Real** and **Wonderful**.

#### The Five Flavors and Provisional/Real

若用此權、實約五味教者：

> If we apply this Provisional/Real to the Five Flavor Teachings:

| Teaching | Provisional? | Real? |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| **Milk (華嚴)** | 4 Provisional | 4 Real |
| **Curds (三藏)** | 4 Provisional only | — |
| **Fresh Butter (方等)** | 12 Provisional | 4 Real |
| **Clarified Butter (般若)** | 8 Provisional | 4 Real |
| **Ghee (法華)** | — | **All 4 Real** |

### Section 9: Opening the Provisional to Reveal the Real

一切諸法莫不皆妙，一色一香無非中道，眾生情隔於妙耳。

> All dharmas without exception are all Wonderful. **One form, one fragrance—none is not the Middle Way.** It is only that sentient beings' feelings are cut off from the Wonderful.

大悲順物，不與世諍，是故明諸權、實不同。

> Great Compassion follows beings and does not contend with the world. Therefore [the Buddha] clarifies the various Provisional and Real as different.

故《無量義》云：「四十餘年，三法、四果、二道不合」、「今開方便門，示真實相」、「唯以一大事因緣，但說無上道」、「開佛知見，悉使得入究竟實相」。

> Therefore the *Sūtra of Immeasurable Meanings* says: "For more than forty years, the Three Dharmas, Four Fruits, and Two Paths did not unite." "Now [I] open the gate of skillful means and reveal the marks of true reality." "Only for the One Great Matter as cause and condition—[I] teach only the unsurpassed Way." "Opening the Buddha's knowledge and vision, causing all to enter ultimate True Reality."

除滅化城，即是決麁；皆至寶所，即是入妙。

> Eliminating the Conjured City—this is **determining the coarse**. All reaching the Treasure Site—this is **entering the Wonderful**.

若乳教四妙，與今妙不殊。唯決其四權，入今之妙。

> If the four Wonderful [teachings] of the Milk Teaching—these are not different from today's Wonderful. Only their four Provisional [teachings] are determined to enter today's Wonderful.

決酪教四權、生蘇十二權、熟蘇八權，皆得入妙。

> Determining the four Provisional of the Curds Teaching, the twelve Provisional of the Fresh Butter Teaching, the eight Provisional of the Clarified Butter Teaching—all can enter the Wonderful.

故文云：「千二百羅漢，悉亦當作佛」。

> Therefore the text says: "**The twelve hundred arhats shall all become Buddhas.**"

又云：「決了聲聞法，是眾經之王，聞已諦思惟，得近無上道」。

> And: "**Decisively understanding the Śrāvaka Dharma—this is the King of all Sūtras. Having heard and carefully reflected, one approaches the unsurpassed Way.**"

開權顯實，其意在此。

> **Opening the Provisional to reveal the Real**—the meaning lies here.

### Section 10: Connecting with the Sūtra

問：今以四悉檀通此經，此經何文明四悉檀耶？

> **Q:** Now we connect the Four Siddhāntas with this sūtra. What text in this sūtra clarifies the Four Siddhāntas?

答：文中處處皆有此意，不能具引。今略引迹本兩文。

> **A:** Throughout the text, this meaning is everywhere; I cannot cite it all. Now I briefly cite two passages from the Trace and Fundamental [teachings].

#### From the "Skillful Means" Chapter (Trace Teaching)

〈方便品〉云：「知眾生諸行，深心之所念，過去所習業，欲性精進力，及諸根利鈍，以種種因緣，譬喻亦言辭，隨應方便說。」

> The "Skillful Means" chapter says: "Knowing the various practices of sentient beings, what their deep minds contemplate, the karmas of past cultivation, their desires, natures, vigor and power, and whether their faculties are sharp or dull—with various causes and conditions, similes and also words, [I] teach according to appropriate skillful means."[^f1p4-3]

此豈非是四悉檀之語耶？

> Is this not the language of the Four Siddhāntas?

欲者即是樂欲，世界悉檀也；性者是智慧性，為人悉檀也；精進力即是破惡，對治悉檀也；諸根利鈍即是兩人得悟不同，即是第一義悉檀也。

> - **Desires** (欲) is delight—the **Worldly Siddhānta**.
> - **Natures** (性) is the nature of wisdom—the **For-Each-Person Siddhānta**.
> - **Vigor and power** (精進力) is breaking evil—the **Therapeutic Siddhānta**.
> - **Faculties sharp or dull** (諸根利鈍) is two people attaining awakening differently—the **First-Principle Siddhānta**.

#### From the "Lifespan" Chapter (Fundamental Teaching)

又〈壽量品〉云：「如來明見，無有錯謬。以諸眾生，有種種性、種種欲、種種行、種種憶想分別故。欲令生諸善根，以若干因緣，譬喻言辭，種種說法，所作佛事，未曾暫廢。」

> The "Lifespan" chapter says: "The Tathāgata clearly sees without error. Because sentient beings have various natures, various desires, various practices, and various recollections and discriminations—wishing to cause them to generate various good roots, with numerous causes and conditions, similes, and words, [I] teach the Dharma in various ways. The Buddha's work is never even momentarily suspended."[^f1p4-4]

種種性者，即是為人；種種欲者，即是世界；種種行者，即是對治；種種憶想分別，即是推理轉邪憶想得見第一義。

> - **Various natures** (種種性) is the **For-Each-Person** [Siddhānta].
> - **Various desires** (種種欲) is the **Worldly** [Siddhānta].
> - **Various practices** (種種行) is the **Therapeutic** [Siddhānta].
> - **Various recollections and discriminations** (種種憶想分別) is inferring principle, transforming wrong recollection, and seeing the **First Principle**.

兩處明文，四義具足，而皆言為眾生說法，豈非四悉檀設教之明證也！

> In both passages, the four meanings are complete; both speak of teaching the Dharma for sentient beings. **Is this not clear evidence that the Four Siddhāntas establish the teaching?**

### Footnotes (Part 4)

[^f1p4-1]: The **Four Kinds of Four Noble Truths** are a distinctively Tiantai classification: (1) Arising-and-Ceasing (生滅) — Tripiṭaka; (2) Non-Arising (無生) — Common; (3) Immeasurable (無量) — Distinct; (4) Non-Created (無作) — Perfect. Each teaching has its own version of the Four Noble Truths.

[^f1p4-2]: These are the **Seven Factors of Awakening** (*saptabodhyaṅga*): mindfulness, discrimination, vigor, joy, tranquility, concentration, and equanimity. Master Zhiyi divides them into groups for treating mental sinking (torpor) and floating (restlessness).

[^f1p4-3]: *Lotus Sūtra*, Chapter 2 ("Skillful Means").

[^f1p4-4]: *Lotus Sūtra*, Chapter 16 ("The Lifespan of the Tathāgata").

# Fascicle 2

## Part 1: The Three Wonderful Dharmas

### Introduction to the Detailed Interpretation

四、正論今意，為二：先、略用彼名顯於妙義。

> **Fourth, the correct discussion of the present meaning** has two parts: first, briefly using those names to reveal the wonderful meaning.

#### The Three Meanings of Cause (因)

因具三義者：

> **Cause possesses three meanings:**

一法界具九法界，名體廣。

> 1. One Dharma-Realm contains the nine Dharma-Realms—this is called **breadth of substance** (體廣).

九法界即佛法界，名位高。

> 2. The nine Dharma-Realms are precisely the Buddha Dharma-Realm—this is called **height of position** (位高).

十法界即空、即假、即中，名用長。

> 3. The Ten Dharma-Realms are precisely emptiness, precisely provisional, precisely the Middle—this is called **length of function** (用長).

即一而論三，即三而論一，非各異，亦非橫，亦非一，故稱妙也。

> Discussing three in terms of one, discussing one in terms of three—neither separately different, nor horizontal, nor singular—therefore it is called **Wonderful**.

#### The Three Meanings of Fruit (果)

果體具三義者，體遍一切處，名體廣。久已成佛久遠久遠，名位高。從本垂迹，過、現、未來三世益物，名用長。

> **The substance of fruit possesses three meanings:**
> - Substance pervades all places—**breadth of substance**.
> - [The Buddha] has long since attained Buddhahood, remotely remote—**height of position**.
> - From the Fundamental, the Trace descends; past, present, and future—benefiting beings in the three times—**length of function**.

是為因果六義，異於餘經，是故稱妙。

> These are the **six meanings of cause and effect**, different from other sūtras. Therefore it is called **Wonderful**.

### The Five Flavors and Cause/Effect

又乳經一種因果廣、高、長，一種因果狹、下、短，則一麁一妙。

> In the **Milk Teaching** (*Avataṃsaka*), one kind of cause-and-effect is broad, high, and long; one kind is narrow, low, and short—thus one coarse, one wonderful.[^f2p1-1]

酪教唯一種因果狹、下、短，但麁無妙。

> In the **Curds Teaching** (*Tripiṭaka*), there is only one kind of cause-and-effect: narrow, low, and short—only coarse, no wonderful.

生蘇經三種因果狹、下、短，一種因果廣、高、長，則三麁一妙。

> In the **Fresh Butter Teaching** (*Vaipulya*), three kinds are narrow, low, short; one kind is broad, high, long—thus three coarse, one wonderful.

熟蘇經二種因果狹、下、短，一種因果廣、高、長，則二麁一妙。

> In the **Clarified Butter Teaching** (*Prajñā*), two kinds are narrow, low, short; one kind is broad, high, long—thus two coarse, one wonderful.

醍醐經一種因果廣、高、長，但妙無麁。

> In the **Ghee Teaching** (*Lotus*), there is one kind of cause-and-effect: broad, high, and long—**only wonderful, no coarse**.

又醍醐經妙因、妙果，與諸經妙因、妙果不異，故稱為妙也。

> Moreover, in the Ghee Teaching, the wonderful cause and wonderful fruit do not differ from the wonderful cause and fruit of other sūtras—therefore it is called **Wonderful**.

### Observing the Mind (觀心)

復次觀心釋。若觀己心不具眾生心、佛心者，是體狹；具者是體廣。

> **Furthermore, the interpretation through Observing the Mind:** If one contemplates one's own mind and [finds that] it does not contain the minds of sentient beings and the Buddha-mind, this is **narrow substance**. If it contains them, this is **broad substance**.

若己心不等佛心是位下；若等佛心是位高。

> If one's own mind is not equal to the Buddha-mind, this is **low position**. If equal to the Buddha-mind, this is **high position**.

若己心、眾生心、佛心，不即空、即假、即中者，是用短；即空、即假、即中者，是用長。

> If one's own mind, sentient beings' minds, and the Buddha-mind are not precisely empty, precisely provisional, precisely the Middle, this is **short function**. If they are precisely empty, precisely provisional, precisely the Middle, this is **long function**.

#### The Four Unities

復次，於一法界通達十法界六即位者，亦是體廣，亦是位高，亦是用長。

> Furthermore, penetrating the Ten Dharma-Realms and the Six Stages of Identity within one Dharma-Realm—this is also breadth of substance, height of position, and length of function.

初約十法界，是顯理一；次約五味，是約教一；次約觀心，是約行一；次約六即，是約人一。略示妙義竟。

> - First, in terms of the Ten Dharma-Realms—this reveals **unity of principle** (理一).
> - Second, in terms of the Five Flavors—this is **unity of teaching** (教一).
> - Third, in terms of Observing the Mind—this is **unity of practice** (行一).
> - Fourth, in terms of the Six Stages—this is **unity of person** (人一).

This completes the summary demonstration of the wonderful meaning.

### The Three Wonderful Dharmas (三法妙)

廣說者：先法，次妙。南岳師舉三種，謂眾生法、佛法、心法。

> **Extensive explanation:** First the dharmas, then the Wonderful. Master Nanyue raised three kinds: **Sentient Being Dharma**, **Buddha Dharma**, and **Mind Dharma**.

如經：「為令眾生，開示悟入佛之知見。」若眾生無佛知見，何所論開？當知佛之知見蘊在眾生也。

> As the sūtra says: "In order to cause sentient beings to open, reveal, awaken to, and enter the Buddha's knowledge and vision." If sentient beings had no Buddha-knowledge-and-vision, what would there be to discuss opening? Therefore know: **the Buddha's knowledge and vision is stored within sentient beings**.[^f2p1-2]

#### 1. Sentient Being Dharma Is Wonderful (眾生法妙)

又經：「但以父母所生眼」，即肉眼；「徹見內外彌樓山」，即天眼。洞見諸色而無染著，即慧眼。見色無錯謬即法眼。雖未得無漏，而其眼根清淨。若此一眼具諸眼用，即佛眼。此是今經明眾生法妙之文也。

> The sūtra says: "With only the eyes born from one's parents"—this is the **fleshly eye**. "Thoroughly seeing both inside and outside Mount Sumeru"—this is the **heavenly eye**. Seeing all forms without attachment—this is the **wisdom eye**. Seeing forms without error—this is the **Dharma eye**. Though one has not yet attained the outflows, the eye-faculty is purified. If this one eye possesses the functions of all eyes—this is the **Buddha eye**.

This is the text in the present sūtra clarifying that **Sentient Being Dharma is Wonderful**.

《大經》云：「學大乘者，雖有肉眼，名為佛眼。耳鼻五根，例亦如是。」

> The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "Those who study the Great Vehicle, though they have fleshly eyes, are called [to have] Buddha eyes. The ear, nose, and five faculties are also thus."

《大品》云：「六自在王，性清淨故。」又云：「一切法趣眼，是趣不過。」

> The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā* says: "The six sovereign kings—because their nature is pure." And: "All dharmas tend toward the eye; this tending does not surpass [the eye]."[^f2p1-3]

此即諸經明眾生法妙也。

> This is how the various sūtras clarify that **Sentient Being Dharma is Wonderful**.

#### 2. Buddha Dharma Is Wonderful (佛法妙)

佛法妙者，如經：「止止不須說，我法妙難思。」

> **Buddha Dharma is Wonderful:** As the sūtra says: "Stop, stop—no need to speak. My Dharma is wonderful and hard to conceive."

佛法不出權、實，「是法甚深妙，難見難可了。一切眾生類，無能知佛者」，即實智妙也。

> The Buddha's Dharma does not go beyond the Provisional and Real. "This Dharma is extremely profound and wonderful, hard to see and hard to comprehend. Among all classes of sentient beings, none can know the Buddha"—this is the **wonderfulness of Real Wisdom**.

「及佛諸餘法，亦無能測者」，即佛權智妙也。

> "And the Buddha's other dharmas—none can fathom them either"—this is the **wonderfulness of the Buddha's Provisional Wisdom**.

如是二法，唯佛與佛乃能究盡諸法實相，是名佛法妙。

> These two dharmas—only a Buddha and a Buddha can fully fathom the True Mark of all dharmas. This is called **Buddha Dharma is Wonderful**.

#### 3. Mind Dharma Is Wonderful (心法妙)

心法妙者，如〈安樂行〉中，修攝其心，觀一切法，不動不退。又一念隨喜等。

> **Mind Dharma is Wonderful:** As in the "Peaceful Practices" [chapter], one cultivates and controls the mind, contemplating all dharmas—unmoved, unretreating. And "a single thought of rejoicing," etc.

《普賢觀》云：「我心自空，罪福無主」「觀心無心，法不住法。」又「心純是法」。

> The *Samantabhadra Contemplation* says: "My mind is itself empty; sins and merits have no master." "Contemplating the mind, there is no mind; dharmas do not abide in dharmas." And: "The mind is purely the Dharma."

《淨名》云：「觀身實相，觀佛亦然。諸佛解脫當於眾生心行中求。」

> The *Vimalakīrti* says: "Contemplating the body's true mark—contemplating the Buddha is also thus. The liberation of all Buddhas should be sought within the mental activities of sentient beings."

《華嚴》云：「心、佛及眾生，是三無差別」「破心微塵，出大千經卷」，是名心法妙也。

> The *Avataṃsaka* says: "**Mind, Buddha, and sentient beings—these three are without difference.**" "**Breaking open the atom of the mind, there emerge sūtra-scrolls of the great-thousand [world].**"[^f2p1-4]

This is called **Mind Dharma is Wonderful**.

### The Ten Suchnesses (十如是)

經論或明一法攝一切法，謂心是：三界無別法，唯是一心作。

> Sūtras and śāstras sometimes clarify that one dharma encompasses all dharmas—this is **Mind**: "In the three realms there are no separate dharmas; they are only made by one mind."

今經用十法攝一切法：「所謂諸法：如是相、如是性、如是體、如是力、如是作、如是因、如是緣、如是果、如是報、如是本末究竟等。」

> **This present sūtra uses ten dharmas to encompass all dharmas:** "The so-called dharmas: suchness of mark, suchness of nature, suchness of substance, suchness of power, suchness of activity, suchness of cause, suchness of condition, suchness of effect, suchness of retribution, suchness of ultimate equality from beginning to end."[^f2p1-5]

南岳師讀此文皆云如，故呼為十如也。

> Master Nanyue read all [ten items] in this text as "*ru*" (如, "suchness")—hence they are called the **Ten Suchnesses**.

#### Master Zhiyi's Threefold Reading

天台師云：「依義讀文，凡有三轉。」

> **Master Tiantai said:** "Reading the text according to meaning, there are altogether **three turns**."

一云：是相如、是性如，乃至是報如。

> **First:** "The mark is suchness, the nature is suchness... down to the retribution is suchness."

二云：如是相、如是性，乃至如是報。

> **Second:** "Suchness of mark, suchness of nature... down to suchness of retribution."

三云：相如是、性如是，乃至報如是。

> **Third:** "The mark is thus, the nature is thus... down to the retribution is thus."

#### The Three Truths in the Three Readings

若皆稱如者，如名不異，即空義也。

> If all are called "suchness"—the name "suchness" is not different—this is the meaning of **Emptiness**.

若作如是相、如是性者，點空相性，名字施設，邐迤不同，即假義也。

> If read as "suchness of mark, suchness of nature," pointing out empty marks and natures with conventional designations, each proceeding differently—this is the meaning of the **Provisional**.

若作相如是者，如於中道實相之是，即中義也。

> If read as "the mark is thus"—"thus" being the true mark of the Middle Way—this is the meaning of the **Middle**.

#### Emptiness, Provisional, and Middle Are Mutually Inclusive

分別令易解故，明空、假、中，得意為言，空即假、中。

> For easy understanding, we distinguish Emptiness, Provisional, and Middle. But grasping the meaning: **Emptiness is precisely Provisional and Middle.**

約如明空，一空一切空。點如明相，一假一切假。就是論中，一中一切中，非一二三而一二三，不縱不橫，名為實相。

> From "suchness," clarify Emptiness—**one emptiness is all emptiness**. Pointing to "suchness," clarify marks—**one provisional is all provisional**. In terms of "thus," discuss the Middle—**one Middle is all Middle**. Neither one, two, three, yet one, two, three. Neither vertical nor horizontal—this is called **True Reality**.

唯佛與佛，究竟此法。

> **Only a Buddha and a Buddha can fathom this dharma.**

是十法，攝一切法。

> These **ten dharmas encompass all dharmas**.

### The Ten Dharma-Realms (十法界)

今明權實者，以十如是約十法界，謂六道、四聖也。

> Now to clarify Provisional and Real: the Ten Suchnesses in terms of the **Ten Dharma-Realms**—the Six Destinies and the Four Sagely [realms].

皆稱法界者，其意有三：

> All are called "Dharma-Realms"—the meaning has three aspects:

一、十數皆依法界，法界外更無復法。能、所合稱，故言十法界也。

> 1. All ten numbers depend on the Dharma-Realm; outside the Dharma-Realm there are no other dharmas. Combining the capable and what is capable—hence "Ten Dharma-Realms."

二、此十種法，分齊不同，因果隔別，凡聖有異，故加之以界也。

> 2. These ten kinds of dharmas differ in their divisions; cause and effect are separately distinguished; ordinary and sagely are different—hence "realm" is added.

三、此十皆即法界，攝一切法。一切法趣地獄，是趣不過。當體即理，更無所依，故名法界。

> 3. All ten are precisely the Dharma-Realm, encompassing all dharmas. All dharmas tend toward hell—the tending does not surpass [hell]. The very substance is principle; there is nothing further to depend on—hence "Dharma-Realm."[^f2p1-6]

### The Hundred Realms and Thousand Suchnesses (百界千如)

此一法界具十如是，十法界具百如是。

> One Dharma-Realm possesses ten suchnesses. **Ten Dharma-Realms possess one hundred suchnesses.**

又一法界具九法界，則有百法界，千如是。

> Moreover, one Dharma-Realm contains nine Dharma-Realms—thus there are **one hundred Dharma-Realms** and **one thousand suchnesses**.

束為五差：一、惡。二、善。三、二乘。四、菩薩。五、佛。判為二法：前四是權法，後一是實法，細論各具權實，且依兩義。

> Grouped into five categories: (1) Evil, (2) Good, (3) Two Vehicles, (4) Bodhisattva, (5) Buddha. Classified into two dharmas: the first four are **Provisional Dharma**; the last one is **Real Dharma**. In detailed discussion, each contains both Provisional and Real; for now we follow the twofold meaning.

然此權實不可思議，乃是三世諸佛二智之境。

> Yet this Provisional and Real is inconceivable—it is the realm of the dual wisdom of the Buddhas of the Three Times.

### The Buddha's Perfect Knowledge

如來洞達，究十法底、盡十法邊，明識眾生：種、非種，芽、未芽，熟、不熟，可度脫、不可度脫，如實知之，無有錯謬。

> The Tathāgata penetrates thoroughly, fathoming the bottom of the ten dharmas, exhausting the boundaries of the ten dharmas. He clearly recognizes sentient beings: seeded or unseeded, sprouted or unsprouted, ripened or unripened, capable of liberation or incapable—**knowing them as they truly are, without error**.

殃掘摩羅雖是惡人，實相性熟，即時得度。四禪比丘雖是善人，惡性相熟，即不堪度。

> Aṅgulimāla, though an evil man, had his true-mark nature ripened—he was immediately ferried across. The monk of the Fourth Dhyāna, though a good man, had his evil-nature mark ripened—he was not capable of being ferried.

當知，眾生之法不可思議，雖實而權，雖權而實，實、權相即，不相妨礙。

> **Know this: Sentient Being Dharma is inconceivable.** Though Real, yet Provisional; though Provisional, yet Real. Real and Provisional mutually entail each other without obstruction.

不可以牛、羊眼觀視眾生，不可以凡夫心評量眾生。智如如來，乃能評量。何以故？眾生法妙故。

> One cannot view sentient beings with ox or sheep eyes. One cannot evaluate sentient beings with an ordinary person's mind. Only wisdom like the Tathāgata's can evaluate them. **Why? Because Sentient Being Dharma is Wonderful.**

### Footnotes (Part 1 of Fascicle 2)

[^f2p1-1]: The **Five Flavor Teachings** represent stages of the Buddha's teaching: Milk (*Avataṃsaka*), Curds (*Tripiṭaka*), Fresh Butter (*Vaipulya*), Clarified Butter (*Prajñā*), and Ghee (*Lotus/Nirvāṇa*).

[^f2p1-2]: This is the famous statement of *tathāgatagarbha* (Buddha-nature) doctrine: the Buddha's knowledge and vision is already present within sentient beings.

[^f2p1-3]: "All dharmas tend toward the eye; this tending does not surpass [the eye]" means that all dharmas are subsumed within each sense faculty—a statement of the mutual containment doctrine.

[^f2p1-4]: "Mind, Buddha, and sentient beings—these three are without difference" (心佛及眾生，是三無差別) is one of the most famous statements in Mahāyāna Buddhism, foundational to Tiantai and Chan.

[^f2p1-5]: The **Ten Suchnesses** (十如是) are a distinctive Tiantai reading of *Lotus Sūtra* Chapter 2. Kumārajīva's translation repeats "ru shi" (如是) ten times; Zhiyi interprets this as ten categories applicable to all dharmas.

[^f2p1-6]: This triple interpretation of "Dharma-Realm" (法界) shows how each of the ten realms is (1) part of the totality, (2) distinct from others, and (3) complete in itself as principle.

---

## Part 2: Relative and Absolute Wonderful

### The Clarification of "Wonderful"

一、通釋，二、別釋。

> [This section has] two parts: (1) General interpretation, (2) Particular interpretation.

通又為二：一、相待，二、絕待。

> The general interpretation also has two parts: (1) **Relative** (相待), (2) **Absolute** (絕待).

此經唯論二妙，更無非絕非待之文。若更作者，絕何惑？顯何理？故不更論也。

> This sūtra discusses only these two kinds of Wonderful; there is no text about "neither absolute nor relative." If we were to posit another [kind], what delusion would it sever? What principle would it reveal? Therefore we do not discuss [a third].

### Section 1: The Relative Wonderful (相待妙)

光宅用《法華》之妙，待前諸教皆麁。巨有所妨，已如前難(云云)。

> Guangzhai used the *Lotus Sūtra's* Wonderful to contrast [it] with all previous teachings as coarse. This has great problems, as already critiqued above.

今待麁妙者，待半字為麁，明滿字為妙，亦是常無常、大小相待，為麁妙也。

> **The present Relative Wonderful:** contrasting the *half-word* [teaching] as coarse, clarifying the *full-word* [teaching] as wonderful. This is also constant/impermanent, great/small mutually contrasted—as coarse and wonderful.[^f2p2-1]

#### Scriptural Evidence for Relative Wonderful

《淨名》云：「說法不有亦不無，以因緣故諸法生。」即是明滿字也。始坐佛樹力降魔，得甘露滅覺道成，即提昔之半待出於滿也。

> The *Vimalakīrti* says: "Teaching the Dharma is neither existent nor non-existent; through causes and conditions, all dharmas arise." This clarifies the full-word [teaching]. "First sitting at the Bodhi Tree, with power subduing Māra, attaining the sweet-dew extinction, the *bodhi* path achieved"—this lifts up the former half-word in contrast to manifest the full.

《般若》云：「於閻浮提見第二法輪轉。」亦是對鹿苑為第一，待般若為第二也。

> The *Prajñā[pāramitā]* says: "In Jambudvīpa, seeing the second turning of the Dharma wheel." This also contrasts the Deer Park as first, waiting for *Prajñā* as second.

《涅槃》云：「昔於波羅柰初轉法輪，今於尸城復轉法輪。」

> The *Nirvāṇa [Sūtra]* says: "Formerly at Vārāṇasī I first turned the Dharma wheel; now at the city of Kuśinagara I again turn the Dharma wheel."

眾經皆共以鹿苑為半、為小、為麁，待此明滿、大、妙，其義是同。

> All sūtras together take the Deer Park as half, as small, as coarse—contrasted with this [later teaching] as full, great, and wonderful. The meaning is the same.

今《法華》明昔於波羅柰，轉四諦法輪，五眾之生滅。今復轉最妙、無上之法輪。此亦待鹿苑為麁，法華為妙。妙義皆同，待麁亦等，文義在此也。

> Now the *Lotus* clarifies: "Formerly at Vārāṇasī, [I] turned the Dharma wheel of the Four Noble Truths, the arising and ceasing of the five aggregates. Now I again turn the most wonderful, unsurpassed Dharma wheel." This also contrasts the Deer Park as coarse, the *Lotus* as wonderful. The meaning of "wonderful" is the same; the contrast with "coarse" is also equal. The text and meaning lie here.

#### The Three Teachings All Share This Structure

問：齊方等來，滿理無殊者，悉應稱妙？

> **Q:** From *Vaipulya* onward, if the full principle is not different, should all be called wonderful?

答：今亦不尅教定時，那忽云齊方等耶？縱令爾者，別有所以。何者？利根菩薩於彼入妙，與《法華》不異。鈍根菩薩及二乘人猶帶方便，諸味調伏。

> **A:** We do not precisely fix teachings to times—how can you suddenly speak of "from *Vaipulya*"? Even granting that: there is a separate reason. Sharp-rooted bodhisattvas at that [point] enter the Wonderful no differently from the *Lotus*. Dull-rooted bodhisattvas and Two Vehicle people still carry expedients; the various flavors discipline [them].

方等帶生蘇論妙以待麁；般若帶熟蘇論妙以待麁；今經無二味方便，純真醍醐論妙以待麁。此妙、彼妙，妙義無殊；但以帶方便、不帶方便為異耳。

> *Vaipulya* brings fresh butter in discussing the Wonderful to contrast the coarse. *Prajñā* brings aged butter in discussing the Wonderful to contrast the coarse. **This present sūtra has no two-flavor expedients—pure true ghee discusses the Wonderful to contrast the coarse.** This Wonderful and that Wonderful—the meaning of "wonderful" is not different. The only difference is bringing expedients or not bringing expedients.

#### The Navigation Metaphor

今以譬解。譬如官有三航及以私船，從於此岸，度人彼岸。

> Now we explain with a simile. It is like the government having three ships and also private boats, ferrying people from this shore to the other shore.

乳教如大中兩航，共度人彼岸。

> The **Milk Teaching** (*Avataṃsaka*) is like large and medium ships, together ferrying people to the other shore.

酪教如私船，度人中洲。

> The **Curds Teaching** (*Tripiṭaka*) is like private boats, ferrying people to a middle island.

生蘇如四種：小航與私船，度人於中洲：兩航度人於彼岸。

> The **Fresh Butter** (*Vaipulya*) is like four kinds: small ships and private boats ferry people to the middle island; two ships ferry people to the other shore.

熟蘇如三航：一航中洲，二航彼岸。

> The **Clarified Butter** (*Prajñā*) is like three ships: one ship [goes to] the middle island, two ships to the other shore.

醍醐如大航，度人彼岸。

> The **Ghee** (*Lotus*) is like a large ship, ferrying people to the other shore.

三航同是官物，故俱稱為滿。私船非官物，是故言半。官物之中，二航小，所容蓋寡；大航壯麗，容載倍多，獨稱為妙。

> The three ships are all government property—hence all are called "full." The private boats are not government property—hence they are called "half." Among the government property, the two [smaller] ships are small, their capacity limited; the large ship is magnificent, carrying many times more—**alone called Wonderful**.

智者以譬喻得解，其譬義如是(云云)。

> The wise understand through similes; the meaning of the simile is thus.

### Section 2: The Absolute Wonderful (絕待妙)

二、絕待明妙者，為四：

> The Absolute Wonderful has four [sub-types]:

#### 2.1 Tripiṭaka Absolute

一、隨情三假法起，若入真諦，待對即絕。故身子云：「吾聞解脫之中，無有言說。」此三藏經中絕待意也。

> First: When the three provisional [dharmas] arise following sentient feeling, if one enters the true principle, the contrast is immediately severed. Therefore Śāriputra said: "I have heard that within liberation, there is no verbal expression." **This is the Absolute meaning within the Tripiṭaka.**

#### 2.2 Common Teaching Absolute

二、若隨理三假，一切世間皆如幻化，即事而真，無有一事而非真者，更待何物為不真耶？望彼三藏，絕還不絕。即事而真，乃是絕待，此通教絕待也。

> Second: If following the three provisional [dharmas] of principle, all the world is like illusion and transformation—phenomena are precisely truth; not a single phenomenon is not truth. What further thing would one contrast as "not true"? Compared to the Tripiṭaka, this "absolute" still is not absolute. **Phenomena precisely being truth—this is absolute.** This is the **Common Teaching Absolute**.

#### 2.3 Distinct Teaching Absolute

三、別教若起，望即真之絕，還是世諦。何者？非大涅槃，猶是生死世諦，絕還有待。若入別教中道，待則絕矣！

> Third: If the Distinct Teaching arises, compared to the "phenomena precisely truth" absolute, [that teaching] is still conventional truth. Why? [Because] it is not the Great Nirvāṇa; it is still the conventional truth of birth-and-death—the absolute still has relativity. **If one enters the Distinct Teaching's Middle Way, then the relative is severed!**

#### 2.4 Perfect Teaching Absolute

四、圓教若起，說無分別法，即邊而中，無非佛法，亡泯清淨。豈更佛法待於佛法？如來法界故，出法界外，無復有法可相形比。待誰為麁？形誰得妙？無所可待，亦無所絕，不知何名，強言為絕。

> Fourth: **If the Perfect Teaching arises, teaching the dharma of no-discrimination**—precisely the extreme is the Middle; nothing is not Buddha-dharma; annihilated and extinguished, pure. How could Buddha-dharma further contrast Buddha-dharma? Because of the Tathāgata's Dharma-Realm, outside the Dharma-Realm there is no further dharma that can be compared. **Whom would one contrast as coarse? Compared to whom would one be wonderful? There is nothing to contrast with, nor anything to sever.** We do not know what to call it—we forcibly speak of it as "absolute."

#### The *Nirvāṇa Sūtra* on the Great

《大經》云：「大名不可稱量，不可思議，故名為大。譬如虛空，不因小空，名為大也。涅槃亦爾，不因小相，名大涅槃。」妙亦如是，妙名不可思議，不因於麁而名為妙。

> The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "**The name 'Great' cannot be weighed or measured; it is inconceivable—hence called 'Great.'** It is like empty space: it is not called 'great' because of small space. Nirvāṇa is also thus; it is not called 'Great Nirvāṇa' because of lesser marks." **Wonderful is also thus: "Wonderful" cannot be conceived; it is not called "Wonderful" because of [contrast with] the coarse.**

#### The Lotus Sutra on Inexpressibility

若謂定有法界廣大獨絕者，此則大有所有，何謂為絕？今法界清淨，非見聞覺知，不可說示。

> If one claims there is definitely a Dharma-Realm that is vast and uniquely absolute, then this "great" would have something to possess—how would it be "absolute"? **The Dharma-Realm is now pure—not seeing, hearing, awareness, or cognition—it cannot be spoken or shown.**

文云：「止止不須說，我法妙難思。」止止不須說，即是絕言；我法妙難思，即是絕思。

> The text says: "**Stop, stop—no need to speak. My Dharma is wonderful and hard to conceive.**" "Stop, stop—no need to speak"—this is **severance of speech**. "My Dharma is wonderful and hard to conceive"—this is **severance of thought**.

又云：「是法不可示，言辭相寂滅。」亦是絕歎之文。不可以待示，不可以絕示，滅待滅絕，故言寂滅。

> And: "**This Dharma cannot be shown; the marks of words are extinguished.**" This is also text of absolute wonder. It cannot be shown through relativity, cannot be shown through absoluteness—eliminating relativity, eliminating absoluteness—hence "extinguished."

又云：「一切諸法，常寂滅相，終歸於空。」此空亦空，則無復待絕。

> And: "**All dharmas constantly have the mark of extinction; they finally return to emptiness.**" This emptiness is also empty—then there is no more relativity or absoluteness.

#### The Middle Way Neither Arises nor Produces Arising

《中論》云：「若法為待成，是法還成待。」今則無因待，亦無所成。《法華》首云：「既得無生忍，亦不生無生。」無生即無生，是名絕待。

> The *Madhyamaka-śāstra* says: "**If a dharma is established through relativity, that dharma in turn establishes relativity.**" Now there is no cause of relativity, nor anything established. The *Lotus* opening says: "**Having attained the patience of non-arising, one also does not give rise to non-arising.**" Non-arising is precisely non-arising—**this is called Absolute Wonderful**.

#### Warning Against Further Proliferation

降此已外，若更作者，絕何物？顯何理？流浪無窮，則墮戲論。乃是迷情分別，絕待不絕，非絕非待待於亦待亦絕，言語相逐，永無絕矣！

> Beyond this, if one were to posit further [categories], what would one sever? What principle would one reveal? Wandering endlessly, one would fall into idle talk. This is confused feeling making discriminations—"absolute" not absolute, "neither absolute nor relative" contrasting "both relative and absolute"—words chasing words, never absolute!

何者？言語從覺觀生，心慮不息，語何由絕？如癡犬逐塊，徒自疲勞，塊終不絕。若能妙悟寰中，息覺觀風，心水澄清，言思皆絕。如黠師子放塊逐人，塊本既除，塊則絕矣！

> Why? Words arise from investigation and discrimination; if mental deliberation does not cease, how could words be severed? It is like a **foolish dog chasing a clod**—tiring itself in vain; the clods never end. If one can wonderfully awaken within the realm, ceasing the wind of investigation and discrimination, the water of mind becomes clear—words and thoughts are both severed. It is like a **clever lion that releases the clod and chases the person**—the source of clods having been removed, the clods are then severed![^f2p2-2]

### The Ten Trace Subtleties (迹中十妙)

別釋妙者，為三...迹中有眾生法妙、佛法妙、心法妙，各十重，合三十重。

> The particular interpretation of "Wonderful" has three [parts]... Within the Trace, there is Sentient Being Dharma Wonderful, Buddha Dharma Wonderful, and Mind Dharma Wonderful—each has ten layers, totaling thirty layers.

迹中十妙者：

> **The Ten Trace Subtleties are:**

一、境妙。二、智妙。三、行妙。四、位妙。五、三法妙。六、感應妙。七、神通妙。八、說法妙。九、眷屬妙。十、功德利益妙。

> 1. **Realm Subtlety** (境妙)
> 2. **Wisdom Subtlety** (智妙)
> 3. **Practice Subtlety** (行妙)
> 4. **Position Subtlety** (位妙)
> 5. **Three Dharmas Subtlety** (三法妙)
> 6. **Resonance Subtlety** (感應妙)
> 7. **Supernatural Powers Subtlety** (神通妙)
> 8. **Teaching the Dharma Subtlety** (說法妙)
> 9. **Retinue Subtlety** (眷屬妙)
> 10. **Merit and Benefit Subtlety** (功德利益妙)

#### Brief Explanations

○標章者...

> **Establishing the chapters:**

云何境妙？謂十如、因緣、四諦、三諦、二諦、一諦等。是諸佛所師，故稱境妙。

> What is **Realm Subtlety**? The Ten Suchnesses, dependent origination, Four Noble Truths, Three Truths, Two Truths, One Truth, etc. These are what all Buddhas take as their teacher—hence called Realm Subtlety.

智妙者，所謂二十智...以境妙故，智亦隨妙。

> **Wisdom Subtlety:** The so-called twenty kinds of wisdom... Because the realm is subtle, wisdom follows as subtle.

行妙者，謂增數行、次第五行、不次第五行，智導行故，故言行妙。

> **Practice Subtlety:** The numerical practices, sequential five practices, non-sequential five practices. Because wisdom guides practice, it is called Practice Subtlety.

位妙者，謂三草位、二木位、一實位，妙行所契，故言位妙。

> **Position Subtlety:** The three-grass positions, two-wood positions, one-real position. What subtle practice realizes—hence called Position Subtlety.[^f2p2-3]

三法妙者，謂總三法，縱三法、橫三法、不縱不橫三法、類通三法，皆祕密藏，故稱為妙。

> **Three Dharmas Subtlety:** The combined three dharmas, vertical three dharmas, horizontal three dharmas, neither-vertical-nor-horizontal three dharmas, analogically-pervading three dharmas. All are the secret treasury—hence called subtle.

感應妙者...水不上升、月不下降，一月一時普現眾水；諸佛不來、眾生不往，慈善根力見如此事，故名感應妙。

> **Resonance Subtlety:** Water does not rise; the moon does not descend. One moon simultaneously manifests in all waters. The Buddhas do not come; sentient beings do not go. Through the power of compassionate roots, one sees such things—hence called Resonance Subtlety.

神通妙者，謂報通、修通、作意通、體法通、無記化化通...若遠、若近、若種、若熟、若脫，皆為一乘，故言神通妙。

> **Supernatural Powers Subtlety:** Karmic powers, cultivated powers, intentional powers, embodying-dharma powers, neutral transformation powers... Whether remote or near, whether seeding or ripening or liberating—all are for the One Vehicle. Hence called Supernatural Powers Subtlety.

說法妙者，謂說十二部法、小部法、大部法、逗緣法、所詮法、圓妙法，如理圓說，咸令眾生開、示、悟、入佛之知見，故言說法妙。

> **Teaching the Dharma Subtlety:** Teaching the Twelve Divisions of scripture, lesser teachings, greater teachings, matching-conditions teachings, what is expressed, the perfect and subtle dharma. Teaching completely in accord with principle, causing all sentient beings to open, reveal, awaken to, and enter the Buddha's knowledge and vision—hence called Teaching Subtlety.

眷屬妙者，謂業眷屬、神通眷屬、願眷屬、應眷屬、法門眷屬，如陰雲籠月，群臣豪族，前後圍遶，故言眷屬妙。

> **Retinue Subtlety:** Karmic retinue, supernatural-power retinue, vow retinue, responsive retinue, dharma-gate retinue. Like cloudy sky surrounding the moon, like ministers and nobility surrounding [the king]—hence called Retinue Subtlety.

利益妙者，謂果益、因益、空益、假益、中益、變易益，猶如大海能受龍雨，故名利益妙。

> **Merit and Benefit Subtlety:** Fruit-benefits, cause-benefits, emptiness-benefits, provisional-benefits, middle-benefits, transformation-benefits. Like the great ocean able to receive dragon-rain—hence called Merit and Benefit Subtlety.

#### The Arising of the Ten Subtleties

○三生起者，實相之境，非佛天人所作，本自有之，非適今也，故最居初。

> **The arising [of the Ten Subtleties]:** The realm of True Reality is not made by Buddha, devas, or humans—it originally exists of itself; it is not [created] just now. Therefore it is placed first.

迷理故起惑，解理故生智。智為行本，因於智目，起於行足。目、足及境，三法為乘，乘於是乘，入清涼池，登於諸位。

> Due to confusion about principle, delusion arises; due to understanding principle, wisdom arises. Wisdom is the root of practice. Because of wisdom's eyes, practice's feet arise. Eyes, feet, and realm—these three dharmas become the vehicle. Riding on this vehicle, one enters the cool pond and ascends the various positions.

位何所住？住於三法祕密藏中。

> What do the positions abide in? They abide in the **secret treasury of the three dharmas**.

住是法已，寂而常照，照十法界機，機來必應。

> Having abided in this dharma, still yet always illuminating, illuminating the capacities of the ten Dharma-Realms—when capacity comes, there must be response.

若赴機垂應，先用身輪，神通駭發。見變通已，堪任受道，即以口輪，宣示開導。既霑法雨，稟教受道，成法眷屬。眷屬行行，拔生死本，開佛知見，得大利益。

> If responding to capacity and bestowing response, first using the body-wheel—supernatural powers startle and awaken. Having seen the transformations, [beings] are capable of receiving the Way. Then using the mouth-wheel, [the Buddha] proclaims and guides. Having been moistened by the Dharma rain, receiving teaching and the Way, they become Dharma retinue. The retinue practices practice, uprooting the root of birth-and-death, opening the Buddha's knowledge and vision, attaining great benefit.

前五約自，因果具足；後五約他，能所具足。法雖無量，十義意圓。自他始終，皆悉究竟也。

> **The first five [subtleties] are in terms of self—cause and fruit are complete. The last five are in terms of others—the able and what is enabled are complete.** Though the dharmas are immeasurable, the meaning of the ten is complete. Self and other, beginning and end—all are exhaustively complete.

### Footnotes (Part 2 of Fascicle 2)

[^f2p2-1]: **Half-word** (半字) refers to the Hīnayāna teaching of impermanence and suffering; **full-word** (滿字) refers to the Mahāyāna teaching of Buddha-nature and permanence. This terminology comes from the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*.

[^f2p2-2]: The simile of the **foolish dog and clever lion** is famous in Tiantai and Chan: a foolish dog chases thrown objects endlessly; a clever lion attacks the thrower, ending the game. Similarly, one must address the source of conceptual proliferation, not chase concepts.

[^f2p2-3]: The **three grasses** and **two trees** refer to the famous *Lotus Sūtra* parable (Chapter 5) of the rain falling equally on all plants, which grow according to their nature—symbolizing the various capacities of beings receiving the one Dharma rain differently.


## Part 3: Realm Subtlety (境妙) — The Six Realms

### The Extensive Interpretation of Realm

廣釋境，又為二：一、釋諸境，二、論諸境同異。

> The extensive interpretation of Realm has two parts: (1) Interpreting the [six] realms, (2) Discussing the sameness and difference of the realms.

釋境為六：一、十如境。二、因緣境。三、四諦境。四、二諦境。五、三諦境。六、一諦境。

> **Interpreting the Realm has six [categories]:**
> 1. **Ten Suchnesses Realm** (十如境)
> 2. **Dependent Origination Realm** (因緣境)
> 3. **Four Noble Truths Realm** (四諦境)
> 4. **Two Truths Realm** (二諦境)
> 5. **Three Truths Realm** (三諦境)
> 6. **One Truth Realm** (一諦境)

#### On the Sequence

然眾經赴緣，明境甚眾，豈可具載？略舉六種。

> The various sūtras respond to conditions, clarifying realms in great number—how could we exhaustively record them? We briefly raise six kinds.

六種次第者，十如是，此經所說，故在初。次十二因緣，三世輪迴，本來具有。如來出世，分別巧示，四諦名興。從廣至略，次辨二諦。二諦語通，別顯中道，次明三諦。三諦猶帶方便，直顯真實，次明一諦。一諦猶有名相，次明無諦。始從無明，終至實際，略用六種足。

> **The sequence of the six:** The Ten Suchnesses are spoken in this sūtra, hence placed first. Next, the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination—cyclic existence through three times, originally complete. The Tathāgata appeared in the world, skillfully distinguishing and revealing [them], and the name "Four Noble Truths" arose. Moving from extensive to concise, we next analyze the Two Truths. The language of Two Truths is comprehensive; to separately reveal the Middle Way, we next clarify the Three Truths. The Three Truths still carry expedients; to directly reveal the Real, we next clarify the One Truth. The One Truth still has name and marks; [beyond this] we clarify No-Truth. Beginning from ignorance, ending at the Real Limit—brief use of six kinds suffices.

### 1. The Ten Suchnesses Realm

已如前說(云云)。

> Already explained above.

### 2. The Dependent Origination Realm

又為四：一、正釋。二、判麁妙。三、開麁顯妙。四、觀心。

> This has four parts: (1) Direct interpretation, (2) Judging coarse and subtle, (3) Opening the coarse to reveal the subtle, (4) Mind contemplation.

#### 正釋 — Direct Interpretation

正釋，又為四：

> The direct interpretation has four [types]:

一、明思議生滅十二因緣。二、明思議不生不滅十二因緣。三、明不思議生滅十二因緣。四、明不思議不生不滅十二因緣。

> 1. **Conceivable Arising-and-Ceasing** Twelve Links
> 2. **Conceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing** Twelve Links
> 3. **Inconceivable Arising-and-Ceasing** Twelve Links
> 4. **Inconceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing** Twelve Links

**Type 1: Conceivable Arising-and-Ceasing (思議生滅)**

思議兩種因緣，為利、鈍兩緣，辨界內法論也。《中》(論云)：「為鈍根弟子說十二因緣生滅相。」

> The two conceivable types of dependent origination are for sharp and dull capacities, discussing dharmas within the [three] realms. The *Madhyamaka-śāstra* says: "For dull-rooted disciples, [we] teach the arising-and-ceasing marks of the twelve links."

此簡異外道；外道邪謂諸法從自在天生，或言世性，或言微塵，或言父母，或言無因，種種邪推，不當道理。

> This distinguishes [Buddhism] from non-Buddhists. Non-Buddhists wrongly claim that dharmas arise from Īśvara, or from world-nature, or from atoms, or from parents, or from no cause—various wrong inferences that do not accord with reason.

*The Painter Simile*

此正因緣不同邪計，唯是過去無明顛倒心中造作諸行，能出今世六道苦果，好惡不同。

> This correct dependent origination differs from wrong views. It is only that past ignorance, in the confused mind, creates various actions, producing the present-life suffering-fruit of the six destinies, good and bad differing.

《正法念》云：「畫人分布五彩，圖一切形，端正醜陋，不可稱計。」原其根本，從畫手出，六道差別，非自在等作，悉從一念無明心出。

> The *Saddharmasmṛtyupasthāna* says: "A painter distributes five colors, drawing all forms—beautiful and ugly beyond measure." Tracing to the root, they come from the painter's hand. **The differentiation of the six destinies is not made by Īśvara and such; all comes from the one-thought of the ignorant mind.**[^f2p3-1]

無明與上品惡行業合，即起地獄因緣，如畫出黑色。無明與中品惡行業合，起畜生道因緣，如畫出赤色。無明與下品惡行合，起鬼道因緣，如畫青色。無明與下品善行合，即起修羅因緣，如畫黃色。無明與中品善行合，即起人因緣，如畫白色。無明與上品善行合，即起天因緣，如畫上上白色。

> | Grade of Action | Destiny | Color |
> |-----------------|---------|-------|
> | **Upper evil** | Hell | Black |
> | **Middle evil** | Animal | Red |
> | **Lower evil** | Hungry ghost | Blue |
> | **Lower good** | Asura | Yellow |
> | **Middle good** | Human | White |
> | **Upper good** | Deva | Purest white |

當知無明與諸行合故，即有六道，名色、六入、觸、受、愛、取、有、生、老、病、死等，隨上中下，差別不同。

> Know that because ignorance combines with actions, there are the six destinies—name-and-form, six sense-bases, contact, feeling, craving, grasping, becoming, birth, old age, sickness, death, etc.—following upper, middle, and lower, differing in distinction.

*The Wheel of Existence*

人天諸趣，苦樂萬品，以生歸死，死已還生，三世盤迴，車輪旋火。

> Human and heavenly destinies, myriad kinds of suffering and happiness, from birth returning to death, after death being reborn again—**cycling through three times like a spinning wheel of fire**.

故《經》言：「有河洄澓沒眾生，無明所盲不能出。」經又稱為十二牽連更相拘帶，亦名十二重城，亦名十二棘園。

> Therefore the sūtra says: "There is a river with whirlpools drowning sentient beings; blinded by ignorance, they cannot escape." The sūtra also calls it "twelve mutually pulling and binding" (十二牽連), also "twelve-layered city" (十二重城), also "twelve-thorn garden" (十二棘園).

此十二因緣，新新生滅，念念不住，故名生滅十二因緣也。

> These twelve links, ever-newly arising and ceasing, not abiding for a single thought-moment—hence called the **Arising-and-Ceasing Twelve Links**.

**Type 2: Conceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing (思議不生不滅)**

二、思議不生不滅十二者，此以巧破拙。《中論》云：「為利根弟子說十二不生不滅。」

> Second, Conceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing Twelve Links: this uses the skillful to break the clumsy. The *Madhyamaka-śāstra* says: "For sharp-rooted disciples, [we] teach the twelve as non-arising-non-ceasing."

癡如虛空，乃至老死如虛空：無明如幻化，不可得故，乃至老死如幻化，不可得。

> **Delusion is like empty space**, up to old-age-and-death being like empty space. Ignorance is like illusion—unobtainable; up to old-age-and-death being like illusion—unobtainable.

《金光明》云：「無明體相，本自不有，妄想因緣，和合而有。」

> The *Suvarṇaprabhāsa* says: "The nature and marks of ignorance originally do not exist; due to false thinking and conditions, they combine to appear."

不善思惟心行所造，如幻師在四衢道，幻作種種象、馬、纓珞、人物等，癡謂真實、智知非真。無明幻出六道依正，當知本自不有，無明所為。如知藤本非蛇，則怖心不生，不生故不滅。是名思議不生不滅十二因緣相也。

> Created by unwholesome mental fabrication, like a magician at a crossroads conjuring various elephants, horses, ornaments, and people—the foolish consider them real; the wise know they are not real. **Ignorance conjures the six destinies' dependent and proper [retributions]**—know that they originally do not exist; ignorance creates them. It is like knowing that a vine is not a snake—then the fearful mind does not arise; not arising, it does not cease. **This is the Conceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing Twelve Links.**

**Type 3: Inconceivable Arising-and-Ceasing (不思議生滅)**

三、不思議生滅因緣者，破小明大，為利鈍兩緣說界外法也。

> Third, Inconceivable Arising-and-Ceasing: breaking the small to clarify the great, teaching dharmas beyond the [three] realms for both sharp and dull capacities.

《華嚴》云：「心如工畫師，作種種五陰。一切世間中，莫不從心造。」畫師，即無明心也。一切世間，即是十法界假實國土等也。

> The *Avataṃsaka* says: "**The mind is like a skilled painter, creating various five aggregates. In all the world, nothing is not made by mind.**" The painter is the ignorant mind. All worlds means the ten Dharma-Realms' provisional and real lands, etc.

*Beyond-Realm Dependent Origination*

出界外十二因緣者，如《寶性論》云：「羅漢、支佛空智，於如來身本所不見。」

> The **beyond-realm twelve links**: as the *Ratnagotravibhāga* says: "The emptiness-wisdom of Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas fundamentally does not see the Tathāgata's body."

二乘雖有無常等四對治，依如來法身，復是顛倒，顛倒故即是無明。

> Although the Two Vehicles have the four antidotes of impermanence, etc., in dependence on the Tathāgata's Dharma-body, [their view] is again confused—**because of confusion, it is ignorance**.

住無漏界中有四種障，謂緣、相、生、壞。

> **Within the outflow-free realm, there are four kinds of obstruction**: condition (緣), mark (相), birth (生), decay (壞).

緣者，謂無明住地，與行作緣也。相者，無明共行為因也。生者，謂無明住地，共無漏業因，生三種意生身也。壞者，三種意生身，緣不可思議變易死也。

> - **Condition**: The ground-of-ignorance conditions action.
> - **Mark**: Ignorance together with action becomes cause.
> - **Birth**: The ground-of-ignorance, together with outflow-free karmic cause, gives birth to the **three kinds of mind-made bodies**.
> - **Decay**: The three mind-made bodies condition **inconceivable transformation-death** (變易死).[^f2p3-2]

還如界內十二因緣，從無明至老死也。

> This is still like the within-realm twelve links, from ignorance to old-age-and-death.

*The Four Imperfections*

彼論云：「三種意生身，未得離無明垢，未得究竟無為淨；無明、細戲論未永滅，未得究竟無為我；無明、細戲論集，因無漏業生意陰未永滅，未得無為樂；煩惱染、業染、生染未究竟滅，未證甘露究竟常。」

> That treatise says: "The three mind-made bodies have not yet separated from the defilement of ignorance—not yet attaining ultimate unconditioned **purity**. The subtle conceptual proliferations of ignorance are not yet permanently extinguished—not yet attaining ultimate unconditioned **self**. The accumulation of subtle conceptual proliferations, mental aggregates born from outflow-free karma, are not yet permanently extinguished—not yet attaining unconditioned **bliss**. The defilements of affliction, karma, and birth are not yet ultimately extinguished—not yet realizing the ultimate **permanence** of sweet-dew."

| Obstruction | What's Missing | Pāramitā |
|-------------|----------------|----------|
| Condition (無明) | Great Purity | 淨 |
| Mark (業) | Eight-fold Self-Mastery | 我 |
| Birth (苦) | Great Bliss | 樂 |
| Decay (死) | Unchanging Permanence | 常 |

**Type 4: Inconceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing (不思議不生不滅)**

不思議不生不滅十二因緣者，為利根人即事顯理也。

> Fourth, **Inconceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing** Twelve Links: for sharp-rooted people, it manifests principle precisely in phenomena.

《大經》云：「十二因緣名為佛性」者，無明、愛、取既是煩惱，煩惱道即是菩提。菩提通達無復煩惱，煩惱既無，即究竟淨，了因佛性也。

> The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "**The twelve links of dependent origination are called Buddha-nature.**" Ignorance, craving, and grasping are afflictions; the path of affliction is precisely *bodhi*. *Bodhi* penetrates [them] so there is no more affliction; affliction not existing, there is ultimate purity—**the understanding-cause Buddha-nature**.

行、有是業道，即是解脫，解脫自在，緣因佛性也。

> Action and becoming are the path of karma—precisely liberation. Liberation is self-mastery—**the conditioning-cause Buddha-nature**.

名色、老死是苦道，苦即法身。法身無苦、無樂，是名大樂。不生不死是常，正因佛性。

> Name-and-form, old-age-and-death are the path of suffering—suffering is precisely the Dharma-body. The Dharma-body having neither suffering nor [ordinary] happiness is called **Great Bliss**. Neither arising nor ceasing is **permanence**—**the direct-cause Buddha-nature**.

故言無明與愛，是二中間，即是中道。無明是過去，愛是現在，若邊若中無非佛性、並是常樂我淨，無明不生亦復不滅。是名不思議不生不滅十二因緣也。

> Therefore it says: "Between ignorance and craving—this is the Middle Way." Ignorance is past; craving is present. **Whether edge or middle, nothing is not Buddha-nature; all is permanence, bliss, self, and purity.** Ignorance neither arises nor ceases. **This is the Inconceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing Twelve Links.**

### 3. The Four Noble Truths Realm

#### The Four Types of Four Noble Truths

四種四諦者：一、生滅。二、無生滅。三、無量。四、無作。其義出《涅槃．聖行品》，約偏、圓、事、理分四種之殊。

> **The Four Types of Four Noble Truths:**
> 1. **Arising-and-Ceasing** (生滅)
> 2. **Non-Arising** (無生滅)
> 3. **Immeasurable** (無量)
> 4. **Without-Action** (無作)

Their meaning comes from the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*, "Sacred Conduct Chapter," distinguished into four kinds according to partial/complete and phenomenal/principle.

**3.1 Arising-and-Ceasing Four Noble Truths (生滅四諦)**

所言生滅者，迷真重故，從事受名。

> What is called "Arising-and-Ceasing": because confusion about truth is heavy, [this teaching] receives its name from phenomena.

《大經》云：「陰入重檐，逼迫繫縛，是苦諦。見愛煩惱，能招來果，是集諦。戒、定、慧、無常、苦、空，能除苦本，是道諦。二十五有子、果縛斷，是滅諦。」

> The *Mahāyāna Parinirvāṇa* says: "The aggregates and sense-fields, layered burdens, oppressing and binding—this is **Suffering**. Views and craving, afflictions that can bring future fruit—this is **Accumulation**. Discipline, concentration, wisdom, impermanence, suffering, emptiness, able to remove the root of suffering—this is the **Path**. The offspring-bondage and fruit-bondage of the twenty-five existences cut off—this is **Cessation**."

**3.2 Non-Arising Four Noble Truths (無生四諦)**

無生者，迷真輕故，從理得名。苦，無逼迫相；集，無和合相；道，不二相；滅，無生相。

> "Non-Arising": because confusion about truth is light, [this teaching] receives its name from principle. **Suffering has no mark of oppression; Accumulation has no mark of combination; the Path has no mark of duality; Cessation has no mark of arising.**

《大經》云：「諸菩薩等解苦無苦，是故無苦而有真諦。」三亦如是。

> The *Mahāyāna Parinirvāṇa* says: "Bodhisattvas understand suffering as non-suffering; therefore there is no suffering yet there is true principle." The [other] three are also thus.

**3.3 Immeasurable Four Noble Truths (無量四諦)**

無量者，迷中重故，從事得名。苦有無量相，十法界果不同故。集有無量相，五住煩惱不同故。道有無量相，恒沙佛法不同故。滅有無量相，諸波羅蜜不同故。

> "Immeasurable": because confusion within [the middle way] is heavy, [this teaching] receives its name from phenomena. **Suffering has immeasurable marks because the fruits of the ten Dharma-Realms differ. Accumulation has immeasurable marks because the five-dwelling afflictions differ. The Path has immeasurable marks because Buddha-dharmas [numerous as] Ganges sands differ. Cessation has immeasurable marks because the *pāramitās* differ.**

《大經》云：「知諸陰苦，名為中智。分別諸陰，有無量相，非諸聲聞、緣覺所知。我於彼經，竟不說之。」

> The *Mahāyāna Parinirvāṇa* says: "To know the suffering of the aggregates is called middle wisdom. To distinguish that the aggregates have immeasurable marks—this is not known by Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas. In those sūtras, I never spoke of it."

**3.4 Without-Action Four Noble Truths (無作四諦)**

無作者，迷中輕故，從理得名。以迷理故，菩提是煩惱，名集諦。涅槃是生死，名苦諦。以能解故，煩惱即菩提，名道諦。生死即涅槃，名滅諦。

> "Without-Action": because confusion within [the middle way] is light, [this teaching] receives its name from principle. **Due to confusion about principle, *bodhi* is affliction—called Accumulation. *Nirvāṇa* is birth-and-death—called Suffering. Due to understanding, affliction is precisely *bodhi*—called the Path. Birth-and-death is precisely *nirvāṇa*—called Cessation.**

即事而中，無思無念，無誰造作，故名無作。

> Precisely phenomena are the Middle; no thought, no conception, no one creating—hence called "Without-Action."

《大經》云：「世諦即是第一義諦。有善方便，隨順眾生，說有二諦。出世人知即第一義諦。」

> The *Mahāyāna Parinirvāṇa* says: "Conventional truth is precisely ultimate truth. Through skillful means, following sentient beings, we speak of two truths. Those who transcend the world know it is precisely ultimate truth."

#### Summary Table: Four Types of Four Noble Truths

| Type | Teaching | Suffering | Accumulation | Path | Cessation |
|------|----------|-----------|--------------|------|-----------|
| **Arising-Ceasing** | Tripiṭaka | Oppression | Afflictions bringing fruit | Discipline, wisdom | Bondage cut |
| **Non-Arising** | Common | No oppression mark | No combination mark | Non-duality | No arising mark |
| **Immeasurable** | Distinct | Infinite per 10 realms | Five-dwelling afflictions | Ganges sands of dharmas | Various *pāramitās* |
| **Without-Action** | Perfect | Birth-death = Nirvāṇa | *Bodhi* = Affliction | Affliction = *Bodhi* | No one creating |

### 4. The Two Truths Realm

#### The Difficulty of Understanding Two Truths

夫二諦者，名出眾經，而其理難曉，世間紛紜，由來碩諍。

> The Two Truths—their name appears in many sūtras, but their principle is difficult to understand. The world is confused; there have long been great disputes.

《妙勝定經》云：「佛昔與文殊，共諍二諦，俱墮地獄。至迦葉佛時，共質所疑。」二聖因地尚不能了，況即人情強生去取？

> The *Subtle Victory Samādhi Sūtra* says: "The Buddha and Mañjuśrī once debated the Two Truths and both fell into hell. At the time of Kāśyapa Buddha, they together resolved their doubts." If even two sages in their causal stage could not understand, how much more [difficult for] ordinary human sentiment forcibly selecting [views]!

#### Three Ways of Speaking Two Truths

今謂不爾。夫經論異說，悉是如來善權方便，知根知欲，種種不同，略有三異，謂隨情、情智、智等。

> We now say it is not so. The various explanations in sūtras and treatises are all the Tathāgata's skillful expedient means, knowing roots and desires, with various differences. Briefly, there are **three different [approaches]**: following feeling (隨情), feeling-and-wisdom (情智), and following wisdom (智).[^f2p3-3]

#### The Seven Types of Two Truths

所言七種二諦者：

> **The Seven Types of Two Truths:**

| # | Conventional (俗) | Ultimate (真) | Teaching |
|---|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| 1 | Real existence | Real extinction | Tripiṭaka |
| 2 | Illusory existence | Illusory-existence-is-empty | Common |
| 3 | Illusory existence | Empty-and-not-empty combined | Distinct (entry) |
| 4 | Illusory existence | All dharmas converge on empty-not-empty | Distinct (full) |
| 5 | Illusory + Illusory-empty = Conventional | Not-existent-not-empty | Perfect (entry) |
| 6 | Illusory + Illusory-empty = Conventional | All converge on not-existent-not-empty | Perfect (approaching) |
| 7 | Illusory + Illusory-empty = Conventional | All converge on existent/empty/neither | Perfect (complete) |

**Type 1: Real Existence Two Truths (實有二諦)**

實有二諦者，陰、入、界等皆是實法。實法所成，森羅萬品，故名為俗。方便修道，滅此俗已，乃得會真。

> **Real Existence Two Truths**: The aggregates, sense-bases, and elements are all real dharmas. What real dharmas constitute, the myriad forms of the world, is called conventional. Through expedient path-cultivation, having extinguished this conventional, one can then realize truth.

《大品》云：「空色、色空」，以滅俗故謂為「空色」；不滅色故謂為「色空」。

> The *Prajñāpāramitā* says: "Emptying form, form is empty." Because conventional is extinguished, it is called "emptying form"; not extinguishing form, it is called "form is empty."

病中無藥，文字中無菩提，皆是此意。

> "Within sickness there is no medicine; within written words there is no *bodhi*"—all are this meaning.

**Type 2: Illusory Existence Two Truths (幻有空二諦)**

幻有空二諦者，斥前意也。何者？實有時無真，滅有時無俗，二諦義不成。

> **Illusory Existence Two Truths** refutes the former meaning. Why? When [dharmas] really exist, there is no truth; when existence is extinguished, there is no conventional. The meaning of Two Truths is not established.

若明幻有者，幻有是俗，幻有不可得，即俗而真。《大品》云：「即色是空，即空是色。」空色相即，二諦義成。

> If one clarifies illusory existence: illusory existence is conventional; illusory existence being unobtainable—precisely conventional is truth. The *Prajñāpāramitā* says: "**Precisely form is emptiness, precisely emptiness is form.**" Emptiness and form being mutually identical, the meaning of Two Truths is established.

**Type 7: Perfect Teaching Two Truths (圓教二諦)**

圓教二諦者，直說不思議二諦也。真即是俗；俗即是真。如如意珠，珠以譬真，用以譬俗。即珠是用，即用是珠，不二而二，分真俗耳。

> **Perfect Teaching Two Truths** directly teach the inconceivable Two Truths. **Truth is precisely conventional; conventional is precisely truth.** It is like a wish-fulfilling jewel: the jewel likens truth; its function likens conventional. **Precisely the jewel is the function; precisely the function is the jewel—not two yet two, distinguishing truth and conventional.**

身子云：「佛以種種緣，譬喻巧言說。其心安如海，我聞疑網斷。」即其義焉。

> Śāriputra said: "The Buddha through various conditions, similes, and skillful words—his mind peaceful as the ocean—I heard and my net of doubt was cut." This is that meaning.

### Footnotes (Part 3 of Fascicle 2)

[^f2p3-1]: This famous simile appears in the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* and becomes central to Tiantai's understanding of mind-only causality: "The mind is like a skilled painter, creating the five aggregates." Unlike Yogācāra's emphasis on *ālaya-vijñāna*, Tiantai emphasizes the **one-thought of ignorance** (一念無明) as the source.

[^f2p3-2]: **Transformation-death** (變易死) is the subtle death experienced by Arhats, Pratyekabuddhas, and great Bodhisattvas in the pure lands. Unlike the coarse birth-and-death of ordinary beings (分段生死), this is the refined death of those who have transcended the three realms but not yet attained complete Buddhahood.

[^f2p3-3]: **Three approaches to Two Truths teaching:**
- **隨情** (Following Feeling): Teaching adapted to the listener's current disposition, which may vary greatly
- **情智** (Feeling-and-Wisdom): The listener perceives conventionally but understands truly
- **隨智** (Following Wisdom): The sage perceives both conventional and ultimate with liberated wisdom

---

## Part 4: Three Truths, One Truth, and Realm Completion

### 5. The Three Truths Realm

眾經備有其義，而名出《纓珞》，《仁王》謂有諦、無諦、中道第一義諦。

> Various sūtras fully contain this meaning, but the name comes from the *Yingluo [Jing]* and *Renwang [Jing]*, which speak of: Existent Truth, Non-Existent Truth, and **Middle Way Ultimate Truth**.[^f2p4-1]

今經亦有其義，〈壽量〉云：「非如非異」即中道。如即真，異即俗。

> This present sūtra also contains this meaning. The *Lifespan Chapter* says: "**Neither same nor different**"—this is the Middle Way. "Same" is truth; "different" is conventional.

#### On Borrowing Terms Between Sūtras

問：若此經無四種因緣等名，那用其義？

> **Q:** If this sūtra does not have the names "four kinds of dependent origination," etc., why use those meanings?

答：五住、二死，名出《勝鬘》，《涅槃》不應用其義。若不用五住，則不破無明。若不用二死，則非常住。又，三佛名出《楞伽》，餘經應無三佛義。眾經皆是佛說，名乃不同，義不可壅(云云)。

> **A:** The "five dwellings" and "two deaths" come from the *Śrīmālā Sūtra*; [by that logic] the *Nirvāṇa Sūtra* should not use those meanings. But if we don't use the five dwellings, we cannot break ignorance. If we don't use the two deaths, there is no permanence. Also, the "three Buddhas" come from the *Laṅkāvatāra*; [by that logic] other sūtras should have no three Buddha meaning. **All sūtras are spoken by the Buddha; names may differ, but meanings cannot be obstructed.**

#### The Five Types of Three Truths

今明三諦為三：一、明三諦。二、判麁妙。三、開麁顯妙。却前兩種二諦，以不明中道故，就五種二諦，得論中道，即有五種三諦。

> Now we clarify the Three Truths in three parts: (1) Clarifying the Three Truths, (2) Judging coarse and subtle, (3) Opening the coarse to reveal the subtle. Setting aside the first two types of Two Truths (since they do not clarify the Middle Way), based on the [remaining] five types of Two Truths, we can discuss the Middle Way—hence there are **Five Types of Three Truths**.

**Type 1: Distinct-Entering-Common Three Truths (別入通三諦)**

約別入通，點非有漏非無漏，三諦義成：有漏是「俗」；無漏是「真」；非有漏非無漏是「中」。當教論中，但異空而已；中無功用，不備諸法。

> In terms of Distinct-entering-Common, pointing to "neither with-outflows nor without-outflows," the Three Truths meaning is established:
> - **With-outflows** = Conventional
> - **Without-outflows** = Truth
> - **Neither with-outflows nor without-outflows** = Middle

Within this teaching, [the Middle] is only different from emptiness; the Middle has no function and **does not contain all dharmas**.

**Type 2: Perfect-Entering-Common Three Truths (圓入通三諦)**

圓入通三諦者，二諦不異前；點非漏非無漏具一切法，與前中異也。

> In Perfect-entering-Common, the Two Truths are not different from before; but pointing to "neither with-outflows nor without-outflows" as **containing all dharmas**—this differs from the former Middle.

**Type 3: Distinct Three Truths (別三諦)**

別三諦者，開彼俗為兩諦，對真為中。中，理而已(云云)。

> Distinct Three Truths: opening that conventional into two truths, contrasting truth as Middle. **The Middle is principle only.**

**Type 4: Perfect-Entering-Distinct Three Truths (圓入別三諦)**

圓入別三諦者，二諦不異前，點真中道具足佛法也。

> Perfect-entering-Distinct Three Truths: the Two Truths are not different from before; pointing to the true Middle Way as **fully containing Buddha-dharma**.

**Type 5: Perfect Three Truths (圓三諦)**

圓三諦者，非但中道具足佛法，真、俗亦然。三諦圓融，一三、三一，如《止觀》中說(云云)。

> **Perfect Three Truths:** Not only does the Middle Way fully contain Buddha-dharma, but truth and conventional also do. **The Three Truths are perfectly interfused—one is three, three is one**—as explained in the *Mohe Zhiguan*.

#### Summary Table: Five Types of Three Truths

| Type | Teaching | Conventional | Truth | Middle |
|------|----------|--------------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Distinct-into-Common | With-outflows | Without-outflows | Neither (empty of function) |
| 2 | Perfect-into-Common | Same | Same | Neither (contains all dharmas) |
| 3 | Distinct | Opened from conventional | Truth | Principle only |
| 4 | Perfect-into-Distinct | Same | Same | Contains Buddha-dharma |
| 5 | **Perfect** | Contains all | Contains all | Contains all |

#### Judging Coarse and Subtle

二判麁妙者，別、圓入通，帶通方便，故為麁；別不帶通為妙。圓入別帶別方便為麁；圓不帶方便，最妙。

> Judging coarse and subtle: Distinct-entering-Common and Perfect-entering-Common carry Common expedients—hence coarse. Distinct not carrying Common is subtle. Perfect-entering-Distinct carries Distinct expedients—hence coarse. **Perfect not carrying expedients is most subtle.**

約五味教者，乳教說三種三諦，二麁一妙。酪教但麁無妙。生蘇、熟蘇，皆具五種三諦，四麁一妙。此經唯一種三諦，即相待妙也。

> In terms of the Five Flavors: Milk teaching has three types—two coarse, one subtle. Curds teaching is only coarse. Fresh Butter and Clarified Butter both have all five types—four coarse, one subtle. **This sūtra has only one type of Three Truths—this is the Relative Wonderful.**

三、開麁顯妙，決前諸麁入一妙，三諦無所可待，是為絕待妙也。

> Opening the coarse to reveal the subtle: deciding all former coarse [teachings] enter the one subtle—the Three Truths have nothing to contrast with—**this is Absolute Wonderful**.

### 6. The One Truth Realm

《大經》云：「所言二諦，其實是一，方便說二。如醉未吐，見日月轉，謂有轉日及不轉日。」醒人但見不轉，不見於轉。轉二為麁，不轉為妙。

> The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "What is called 'Two Truths' is actually one; [we] expediently speak of two. **It is like a drunk who has not yet vomited, seeing the sun and moon spinning, saying there is a 'spinning sun' and a 'non-spinning sun.'**" A sober person only sees non-spinning, not spinning. **The two that spin are coarse; the non-spinning is subtle.**

三藏全是轉二，同彼醉人。諸大乘經帶轉二、說不轉一。今經正直捨方便，但說無上道，不轉一實，是故為妙。

> The Tripiṭaka entirely consists of spinning two—like that drunk person. The various Mahāyāna sūtras carry the spinning two while speaking of the non-spinning one. **This present sūtra straightforwardly abandons expedients, only teaching the unsurpassed Way—the non-spinning One Reality—hence it is subtle.**

#### Teaching vs. Realization

《地持》明地相明義，說相似法。地實明義，說真實法。又教門方便即教道明義，說所證法即證道明義。今借用之。

> The *Daśabhūmika-sūtra-śāstra* clarifies: "Clarifying by stage-marks" means teaching approximate dharma. "Clarifying by stage-reality" means teaching true real dharma. Also: expedient teaching gates = teaching-path clarification; the dharma realized = realization-path clarification. We borrow this here.

「諸佛法久後，要當說真實」，即地實義。「道場所得法」，即是證道明義，是故妙也。

> "After a long time, the Buddhas must speak the Real"—this is the stage-reality meaning. "The Dharma attained at the Bodhi-site"—this is realization-path clarification. **Hence it is subtle.**

#### Beyond One Truth: No-Truth

執著此實，實語是虛語，生語見故，故名為麁。融通無著是故言妙。

> Clinging to this Reality, "real words" become false words, because verbal views arise—hence called coarse. **Penetrating without attachment—hence called subtle.**

諸諦不可說者，「諸法從本來，常自寂滅相」，那得諸諦紛紜相礙？一諦尚無，諸諦安有？一一皆不可說，可說為麁，不可說為妙。

> **The truths cannot be spoken**: "All dharmas from the beginning constantly have the mark of extinction"—how could there be various truths in confused mutual obstruction? If one truth does not exist, how could various truths exist? Each and every [truth] cannot be spoken. **What can be spoken is coarse; what cannot be spoken is subtle.**

不可說亦不可說是妙，是妙亦妙，言語道斷故。

> "Cannot be spoken" also cannot be spoken—this is subtle. **"This subtle" is also subtle, because the path of words is cut off.**

#### The Fourfold Unspeakability

若通作不可說者，生生不可說，乃至不生不生不可說。前不可說為麁，不生不生不可說為妙。若麁異妙，相待不融；麁妙不二，即絕待妙也(云云)。

> If we comprehensively make [all] unspeakable:
> - **Arising-arising** cannot be spoken
> - **Arising-non-arising** cannot be spoken
> - **Non-arising-arising** cannot be spoken
> - **Non-arising-non-arising** cannot be spoken

The former "unspeakable" is coarse; "non-arising-non-arising unspeakable" is subtle. If coarse differs from subtle, [they are] relative and not fused. **Coarse and subtle not being two—this is Absolute Wonderful.**

#### Why Do Both Small and Great Vehicles Have "No-Truth"?

問：何故大小通論無諦？

> **Q:** Why do both great and small vehicles discuss "no-truth"?

答：《釋論》云：「不破聖人心中所得涅槃，為未得者執涅槃生戲論，如緣無生使，故破。」言無諦也。

> **A:** The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* says: "We do not break the nirvāṇa attained in the sage's mind. For those who have not attained [it] and cling to nirvāṇa, generating idle talk—like conditions producing the 'non-arising' fetter—therefore we break [it]." This is called "no-truth."

問：若爾，小乘得與不得俱皆被破，大乘得與不得亦俱應破。

> **Q:** If so, in the small vehicle both attained and not-attained are both broken. Should not great vehicle attained and not-attained also both be broken?

答：不例。小乘猶有別惑可除、別理可顯故，雖得須破；中道不爾，得云何破？

> **A:** Not comparable. The small vehicle still has separate delusions to remove and separate principle to reveal—hence even what is attained must be broken. **The Middle Way is not thus—what is attained, how could it be broken?**

問：若爾，中道唯應有一實諦，不應言無諦也？

> **Q:** If so, the Middle Way should only have One Real Truth—it should not be called "no-truth"!

答：為未得者執中生惑，故須無諦。實得者有，戲論者無(云云)。

> **A:** For those who have not attained [it] and cling to the Middle, generating delusion—therefore we need "no-truth." **For those who have truly attained, there is [truth]; for those engaged in idle talk, there is not.**

#### Summary: Six Realms Overview

| # | Realm | Content | Teaching Progression |
|---|-------|---------|---------------------|
| 1 | Ten Suchnesses | Lotus Sutra's own | This sūtra |
| 2 | Dependent Origination | 4 types: Conceivable/Inconceivable × Arising/Non-Arising | Milk → Ghee |
| 3 | Four Noble Truths | 4 types: Arising-Ceasing → Without-Action | Tripiṭaka → Perfect |
| 4 | Two Truths | 7 types × 3 approaches | All teachings |
| 5 | Three Truths | 5 types: Distinct-Common → Perfect | Common → Perfect |
| 6 | One Truth / No-Truth | Non-spinning reality, path of words cut | Ultimate |

### Footnotes (Part 4 of Fascicle 2)

[^f2p4-1]: The **Three Truths** (三諦) doctrine becomes one of Tiantai's signature teachings. Unlike the Two Truths of Mādhyamaka (conventional and ultimate), Tiantai posits three: (1) **Emptiness** (空諦)—the ultimate nature of all phenomena, (2) **Provisional Existence** (假諦)—the conventional designations, and (3) **Middle** (中諦)—the simultaneous affirmation of both without one-sidedness. In the Perfect Teaching, these three are "perfectly interfused" (圓融)—each contains the others.

# Fascicle 3

## Part 1: Wisdom Subtlety (智妙) — The Twenty Wisdoms

### The Second [Subtlety]: Wisdom Subtlety

至理玄微，非智莫顯；智能知所，非境不融。境既融妙，智亦稱之，其猶影響矣，故次境說智。

> **Ultimate principle is profound and subtle—without wisdom, it cannot be revealed. Wisdom knows what [is to be known]—without realm, there is no fusion.** The realm being fused and subtle, wisdom also accords with it, just as shadow follows form. Therefore after Realm, we explain Wisdom.

#### Overview of the Six Topics

智即為二：初、總論諸智，二、對境論智。總智為六：一、數；二、類；三、相；四、照；五、判；六、開。

> Wisdom has two parts: (1) General discussion of the wisdoms, (2) Wisdom discussed in relation to realm. The general [discussion] has six [topics]: (1) **Number**, (2) **Classification**, (3) **Characteristics**, (4) **Illumination**, (5) **Judgment**, (6) **Opening**.

#### The Twenty Wisdoms

數者：

> **The Number:**

| 18 | **Six Roots Purified** (六根清淨智) | Perfect |
| 19 | **First Abiding to Equal Awakening** (初住至等覺智) | Perfect |
| 20 | **Wondrous Awakening** (妙覺智) | Perfect |

#### Classification by Group

二、類者，

> **Classification:**

世智無道，邪計妄執，心行理外，不信不入，故為一。

> **World Wisdom** has no [Buddhist] path—wrong views and false attachments, mental activity outside principle, not believing, not entering. Hence it is one [category].

五停心、四念處，已入初賢佛法氣分，俱是外凡，故為一。

> **Five Stilling-Hearts and Four Mindfulnesses**: having entered the initial stage of worthy Buddha-dharma, both are outer-ordinary. Hence one.

四善根同是內凡，故為一。

> **Four Roots-of-Good**: all are inner-ordinary. Hence one.

四果同見真，故為一。

> **Four Fruits**: all see truth. Hence one.

支佛別相觀能侵習，故為一。

> **Pratyekabuddha**: separate-aspect contemplation can encroach on habitual tendencies. Hence one.

六度緣理智弱、緣事智強，故為一。

> **Six Perfections**: wisdom conditioning principle is weak; wisdom conditioning phenomena is strong. Hence one.

通教方便聲聞體法智勝，故為一。支佛又小勝，故為一。

> **Common Śrāvaka Body-Dharma Wisdom** is superior [to Tripiṭaka]. Hence one. **Common Pratyekabuddha** is slightly superior again. Hence one.

通教菩薩入真方便智，四門遍學，故為一。通教出假菩薩智，正緣俗，故為一。

> **Common Bodhisattva Entry-True**: learns all four gates. Hence one. **Common Exit-Provisional**: properly conditions the conventional. Hence one.

別教十信智，先知中道，勝前劣後，故為一。別教三十心俱是內凡，故為一。十地同是聖智，故為一。

> **Distinct Ten Faiths**: first knows the Middle Way, superior to former, inferior to later. Hence one. **Distinct Thirty Minds**: all inner-ordinary. Hence one. **Ten Grounds**: all sage-wisdom. Hence one.

三藏佛是師位名，勝三乘弟子，故為一。通教佛智，斷惑照機勝，故為一。別教佛智又勝，故為一。

> **Tripiṭaka Buddha**: the teacher position, superior to three-vehicle disciples. Hence one. **Common Buddha**: cutting delusion and illuminating capacity is superior. Hence one. **Distinct Buddha**: yet superior. Hence one.

圓教五品弟子同具煩惱性，能知如來祕密之藏，故為一。六根清淨智隣真，故為一。初住至等覺同破無明，故為一。妙覺佛智無上最尊，故為一。

> **Perfect Five Grades**: all possess the nature of afflictions yet can know the Tathāgata's secret treasury. Hence one. **Six Roots Purified**: neighbors the true. Hence one. **First Abiding to Equal Awakening**: all break ignorance. Hence one. **Wondrous Awakening Buddha Wisdom**: unsurpassed, most honored. Hence one.

如是等隨其類分相似者，或離、或合，判為二十(云云)。

> Thus classifying by type those that are similar—whether separating or combining—**we judge them as twenty**.

#### Characteristics

三、辨相者，

> **Distinguishing Characteristics:**

**World Wisdom (世智)**

天竺世智，極至非想。此間所宗，要在忠孝、五行、六藝、天文、地理、醫方、卜相、兵法、貨法、草木千種皆識，禽獸萬品知名。

> In India, world wisdom reaches at most "neither-perception-nor-non-perception." What is valued here [in China] lies in loyalty and filial piety, the five elements, the six arts, astronomy, geography, medicine, divination, military strategy, commerce—knowing a thousand kinds of plants, naming ten thousand kinds of animals.

又塗左割右等無憎愛。獲根本定，發五神通，停河在耳，變釋為羊，納吐風雲，捫摸日月。

> Also [achieving] impartiality like painting left and cutting right without hatred or love. Attaining root concentration, developing the five supernatural powers—stopping rivers in the ear, transforming Indra into a sheep, breathing in and out wind and clouds, touching sun and moon.

法是世間法，定是不動定，慧是不動出。邀名利、增見愛，世心所知，故名世智也。

> The dharmas are worldly dharmas; the concentration is immovable concentration; the wisdom is exiting from immovability. **Seeking fame and profit, increasing views and craving—known by the worldly mind—hence called World Wisdom.**

**Four Roots-of-Good (煖、頂、忍、世第一法)**

**Warmth (煖)**

煖法緣四諦境生智，伏煩惱，智更增，成十六觀智。

> **Warmth-dharma**: conditioning the realm of four truths, wisdom arises, subduing afflictions; wisdom further increases, becoming the sixteen contemplation-wisdoms.

如火鑽，上下相依，生火燒薪。以有智知有境，能生煖智，令有萎悴。

> It is like a fire-drill—above and below depending on each other, generating fire to burn fuel. **With wisdom knowing realm, one can generate warmth-wisdom, causing [the fuel of] existence to wither.**

尊者瞿沙說：求解脫智火，煖最在初。如火，以煙在初為相。無漏智火亦以煖法在先為相。

> Venerable Ghoṣa said: "Seeking the wisdom-fire of liberation, warmth is at the beginning. Like fire, having smoke at the beginning as its mark—the fire of outflow-free wisdom also has warmth-dharma at the beginning as its mark."

**Summit (頂)**

頂法者，色界善根，有動、不動，住、不住，有難、不難，斷、不斷，退、不退。

> **Summit-dharma**: form-realm wholesome roots—movable and immovable, abiding and not abiding, with difficulty and without difficulty, cut and not cut, regressing and not regressing.

就動乃至退者，有二：下者是煖，上是頂。彼不動乃至不退者為二：下者是忍，上者是世第一法。

> Among those movable through regressing, there are two: lower is warmth, upper is summit. Among those immovable through non-regressing, there are two: lower is patience, upper is world-first-dharma.

如山頂之道，人不久住。若無難，必過此到彼；若遇難，即便退還。行者住頂不久，若無難必到忍；有難退還煖。猶如山頂，故名頂。

> **It is like a path on a mountain summit—people do not stay long.** Without difficulty, they necessarily cross to the other side; encountering difficulty, they then retreat. Practitioners at the summit do not stay long—without difficulty, they necessarily reach patience; with difficulty, they retreat to warmth. Like a mountain summit—hence called Summit.

**Patience (忍)**

忍法觀者，正觀欲界苦，色、無色界苦...

> **Patience-dharma contemplation**: Correctly contemplating the suffering of the desire realm, form and formless realms...

如是三十二心，是名下忍。行者後時，漸漸減損行及緣...是名中忍。復以一心觀欲界苦，是名上忍。

> Thus thirty-two minds—this is called **lower patience**. Later, the practitioner gradually reduces practices and conditions... this is called **middle patience**. Then with one mind contemplating desire-realm suffering—this is called **upper patience**.

**World-First-Dharma (世第一法)**

世第一法者，此心心數法，於餘法為最、為勝、為長、為尊、為上、為妙。

> **World-First-dharma**: This mind and mental factors, compared to other dharmas, are the most, the superior, the chief, the honored, the uppermost, the subtle.

最勝義是第一義；得妙果是第一義，如高幢頂，更無有上，是第一義。

> The meaning of "most superior" is "ultimate meaning." Attaining the subtle fruit is ultimate meaning—**like the top of a high banner, with nothing higher—this is ultimate meaning.**

#### Four Wisdoms Illuminating Dependent Origination

二十智照四種十二因緣境者：

> **Twenty Wisdoms illuminating the four types of Twelve Links:**

世智、五停、四念、四果乃至支佛、六度、三藏佛，凡七智，照思議生滅十二因緣境。

> World wisdom, Five Stillings, Four Mindfulnesses, Four Fruits, up to Pratyekabuddha, Six Perfections, Tripiṭaka Buddha—**seven wisdoms in total illuminate the Conceivable Arising-and-Ceasing Twelve Links**.

通教三乘入真方便智、出假智、佛智凡五智，照思議不生不滅十二因緣境。

> Common Teaching's three-vehicle Entry-True Expedient wisdom, Exit-Provisional wisdom, Buddha wisdom—**five wisdoms illuminate the Conceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing Twelve Links**.

別教十信、三十心、十地、佛凡四智，照不思議生滅十二因緣境。

> Distinct Teaching's Ten Faiths, Thirty Minds, Ten Grounds, Buddha—**four wisdoms illuminate the Inconceivable Arising-and-Ceasing Twelve Links**.

圓教四智，照不思議不生不滅十二因緣境。

> Perfect Teaching's **four wisdoms illuminate the Inconceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing Twelve Links**.

#### Judging Coarse and Subtle

五、明麁妙者，前十二番智是麁，後八番智為妙。

> **Judging coarse and subtle:** The former twelve types of wisdom are coarse; the latter eight types are subtle.

何者？藏、通等佛，自是無常，亦不說常，彼二乘菩薩何得聞常、信常、修常？是故為麁。

> Why? Tripiṭaka and Common Buddhas are themselves impermanent and do not teach permanence—how could their Two Vehicle and bodhisattva [disciples] hear, believe in, or cultivate permanence? **Hence coarse.**

別教十信初已聞常，信、修於常，尚勝彼佛，何況餘耶？是故為妙。

> **Distinct Teaching Ten Faiths has already heard permanence from the beginning**—believing and cultivating permanence—still surpasses those [Tripiṭaka/Common] Buddhas. How much more the rest! **Hence subtle.**

**Distinct Teaching: Three Coarse, One Subtle**

又，別教四智，三麁一妙。

> Also, Distinct Teaching's four wisdoms: **three coarse, one subtle**.

地人云：「中道乃是果頭能顯，初心學者仰信此理，如藕絲懸山。」

> The *Dilun* school says: "The Middle Way is revealed only at the fruit-stage. Beginners look up and believe in this principle **like hanging a mountain by a lotus fiber.**"

故說信、行皆非圓意也。故十信智為麁。十住正修空，傍修假、中。十行正修假，傍修中。十迴向始正修中。此中但理，不具諸法，是故皆麁。

> Hence they say faith and practice are not Perfect intention. Hence **Ten Faiths wisdom is coarse**. Ten Abidings primarily cultivate emptiness, secondarily cultivate provisional and middle. Ten Practices primarily cultivate provisional, secondarily middle. Ten Dedications begin primarily cultivating middle. But this middle is only principle, **not containing all dharmas—hence all coarse**.

登地智破無明，見中道，證則為妙。

> **Ground-attaining wisdom breaks ignorance, sees the Middle Way—realization is subtle.**

**Perfect Teaching: All Four Subtle**

圓教四智皆妙者，如法相說，如說而信，如理而行，始論五品，終竟妙覺，實而非權，是故皆妙。是名待麁智說妙智也。

> **Perfect Teaching's four wisdoms are all subtle:** As the dharma-mark is spoken, so one believes; as principle is, so one practices. Beginning with the Five Grades, ending with Wondrous Awakening—**real and not expedient—hence all subtle.** This is explaining subtle wisdom by contrasting coarse wisdom.

#### Opening the Coarse to Reveal the Subtle

六、明開麁顯妙者，前十六番智，若不決了，但是麁智；若得決了，悉成妙智。

> **Opening the coarse to reveal the subtle:** The former sixteen types of wisdom—if not decisively clarified, they are only coarse wisdom. If decisively clarified, **all become subtle wisdom**.

何者？如妙莊嚴王，先是外道世智，聞《法華經》便得決了，以邪相入正相，於諸見不動而修三十七品，不捨八邪而入八正，即是決於世智，得入妙智。

> Why? Like King Wonderful Adornment—formerly possessing non-Buddhist world wisdom, upon hearing the *Lotus Sūtra* he immediately attained decisive clarity. **With wrong marks entering right marks, among all views without moving he cultivated the thirty-seven factors of awakening; not abandoning the eight wrongs, he entered the eight rights.** This is deciding world wisdom, entering subtle wisdom.

十六麁智皆成妙智，無麁可待，即是絕待智妙也。

> **All sixteen coarse wisdoms become subtle wisdom. With no coarse to contrast, this is Absolute Wisdom Subtlety.**

### Footnotes (Part 1 of Fascicle 3)

[^f3p1-1]: The **Twenty Wisdoms** represent the complete taxonomy of Buddhist wisdom across all four teachings. The first twelve (wisdoms 1-16, minus Perfect) are "coarse" because they lead to impermanent results or partial understanding. The final eight (Perfect wisdoms + parts of Distinct) are "subtle" because they lead to permanent realization of the Middle Way.

---

## Part 2: Practice Subtlety (行妙) — Wisdom-Eyes and Practice-Feet

### The Third [Subtlety]: Practice Subtlety

#### The Relationship of Wisdom and Practice

為二：一、通途增數行，二、約教增數行。

> This has two [parts]: (1) **Common-path increasing-number practices**, (2) **Teaching-specific increasing-number practices**.

夫行名進趣，非智不前。智解導行，非境不正。智目行足，到清涼池。

> **Practice means advancing forward—without wisdom, there is no progress.** Wisdom-understanding guides practice—without realm, practice is not correct. **Wisdom is the eyes; practice is the feet—[together they] arrive at the clear cool pond.**[^f3p2-1]

而解是行本，行能成智，故行滿而智圓。智能顯理，理窮則智息。

> Understanding is the root of practice; practice can complete wisdom—hence when practice is full, wisdom is perfected. Wisdom can reveal principle; when principle is exhausted, wisdom ceases.

如此相須者，則非妙行。妙行者，一行一切行。

> **Such mutual dependence is not yet subtle practice. Subtle practice means: one practice is all practices.**

#### Scriptural Evidence

如經：「本從無數佛，具足行諸道。」又云：「無量諸佛所，而行深妙道。」又云：「盡行諸佛所有道法。」

> As the sūtra says: "Originally from numberless Buddhas, completely practicing all paths." Also: "At [the places of] immeasurable Buddhas, practicing the deep and subtle path." Also: "Exhaustively practicing all the path-dharmas of all Buddhas."

既具、復深、又盡。具即是廣，深即是高，盡即究竟。

> Having "complete," moreover "deep," and also "exhaustive": **Complete means broad; deep means high; exhaustive means ultimate.**

#### The Threefold Unity

此之妙行，與前境、智，一而論三，三而論一。

> This subtle practice, together with the former realm and wisdom, **is one discussed as three, three discussed as one**.

前境說如法相，法相亦具三，名祕密藏。前智是如法相解，解亦具三，如面上三目。今行是所行，如所說行，亦具三，名伊字三點。

> Former realm was explained as dharma-marks; dharma-marks also contain three, called the secret treasury. Former wisdom is understanding of dharma-marks; understanding also contains three, like three eyes on a face. **Present practice is what is practiced**; practicing as taught, it also contains three, called the **three dots of the *i* character** (伊字三點).[^f3p2-2]

若三若一，皆無缺減，故稱妙行耳。

> **Whether three or one, there is no deficiency—hence called subtle practice.**

#### Part 1: Common-Path Increasing-Number Practices

《釋論》云：「菩薩行般若時，以一法為行，攝一切行；或無量一法為行，攝一切行。或二法為行，攝一切行；或無量二法為行，攝一切行。乃至十法百法千萬億法為行，攝一切行；或無量十法百千萬億法為行，攝一切行。」

> The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* says: "When bodhisattvas practice *prajñā*, **with one dharma as practice, they encompass all practices**; or with immeasurable one-dharmas as practice, they encompass all practices. With two dharmas as practice, they encompass all practices... up to ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, a hundred million dharmas as practice—they encompass all practices."

行雖眾多，以智為本。智如導主，行若商人。智如利針，行如長線。智御行牛，車則安隱，能有所至。

> **Though practices are many, wisdom is the root.** Wisdom is like a guide-leader; practice is like merchants. **Wisdom is like a sharp needle; practice is like a long thread.** Wisdom drives the ox of practice; the cart is then stable and can arrive somewhere.

#### Part 2: Teaching-Specific Increasing-Number Practices

**Tripiṭaka Teaching: One Practice**

若三藏增數明行，如《阿含》中，佛告比丘：「當修一行，我證汝等四沙門果，謂心不放逸。若能護心不放逸行，廣演廣布，則所作已辦，能得涅槃。」

> In the Tripiṭaka's increasing-number practices: as in the *Āgamas*, the Buddha told the monks: "You should cultivate **one practice**—I guarantee you the four *śramaṇa* fruits—namely, **the mind not being heedless**. If you can guard the mind with non-heedless practice, broadly expounding and spreading it, then what is to be done is accomplished and you can attain nirvāṇa."

**Tripiṭaka: Two Practices**

增二數明行者，《阿含》云：「阿練若比丘，當修二法為行，謂修止、修觀。」

> In increasing by twos: The *Āgamas* say: "Forest-dwelling monks should cultivate **two dharmas** as practice: cultivating **cessation** (*śamatha*) and cultivating **insight** (*vipaśyanā*)."

若修止時，即能休息諸惡，戒律威儀、諸行禁戒悉皆不失，成諸功德。若修觀時，即能觀苦，如實知之。觀苦集、苦盡、苦出要，如實知之，得盡漏，不受後有。

> When cultivating cessation, one can rest all evil; discipline, conduct, and all precepts are not lost—accomplishing all merits. When cultivating insight, one can contemplate suffering, knowing it as it truly is. Contemplating suffering's accumulation, cessation, and path of escape, knowing them as they truly are—attaining the exhaustion of outflows, not receiving further existence.

怛薩阿竭亦如是修。

> The Tathāgata also cultivated thus.

**Tripiṭaka: Three Practices**

增三數明行者，謂戒、定、慧，此三是出世梯隥，佛法軌儀。

> In increasing by threes: **Discipline, concentration, wisdom**—these three are the ladder out of the world, the standard pattern of Buddha-dharma.

《戒經》云：「諸惡莫作，諸善奉行，自淨其意，是諸佛教。」

> The *Prātimokṣa* says: "**All evils not to be done; all goods to be practiced; self-purify one's mind—this is the teaching of all Buddhas.**"

諸惡即七支過罪輕重非違，《五部律》廣明其相。如是等惡，戒所防止。諸善者，善三業，若散若靜、前後方便、支林功德，悉是清升，故稱為善。自淨其意者，即是破諸邪倒，了知世間、出世間因果，正助法門，能消除心垢，淨諸瑕穢，豈過於慧？佛法曠海，此三攝盡。

> All evils means the seven-branch transgressions, grave and light violations—the *Five-part Vinaya* extensively clarifies their marks. Such evils are what discipline prevents. All goods means wholesome three karmas, whether scattered or concentrated, preparatory and subsequent skillful means, auxiliary merits—all are pure ascent, hence called goods. Self-purify one's mind means breaking all wrong views, understanding mundane and transcendent cause-and-effect, main and auxiliary dharma-gates—able to eliminate mental defilements, purifying all stains. What exceeds wisdom? **Buddha-dharma is a vast ocean; these three encompass it all.**

**Common Teaching: Increasing-Number Practices**

通教增數行者，不定部帙判通教，但取三乘共學法門，指此為通耳。

> Common Teaching's increasing-number practices: Not fixing texts to determine the Common Teaching, we simply take the dharma-gates studied in common by the three vehicles and point to this as "Common."

《論》云：「菩薩行般若時，雖知諸法一相，亦能知一切法種種相；雖知諸法種種相，亦能知一切法一相。」

> The *Treatise* says: "When bodhisattvas practice *prajñā*, **though knowing all dharmas as one-mark, they can also know all dharmas' various marks; though knowing all dharmas' various marks, they can also know all dharmas as one-mark.**"

云何觀一切法一相？所謂觀一切法無相：如四大各各不相離，地中有水、火、風，但地多，以地為名...

> How does one contemplate all dharmas as one-mark? Namely, contemplating all dharmas as no-mark: like the four great elements not separating from each other—earth contains water, fire, and wind, but earth is dominant, so it is named "earth"...

是為觀一切法一相，一相無相。

> **This is contemplating all dharmas as one-mark; one-mark is no-mark.**

**Distinct Teaching: Increasing-Number Practices**

別教增數行者。如善財入法界中說於一善知識所，各聞一法為行...乃至一百一十善知識，一一法門皆如是。

> Distinct Teaching's increasing-number practices: Like Sudhana entering the Dharma-realm, at each good teacher's place he heard one dharma as practice... up to 110 good teachers, each dharma-gate being thus.

是一一行皆破無明，入深境界。

> **Each and every practice breaks ignorance, entering deep realms.**

**Perfect Teaching: Increasing-Number Practices**

圓教增數行者，如《文殊問經》明菩薩修一行三昧，當於靜室，結跏趺坐，繫緣法界，一念法界，一切無明顛倒永寂如空。

> Perfect Teaching's increasing-number practices: As the *Mañjuśrī-paripṛcchā Sūtra* clarifies—bodhisattvas cultivating the **One-Practice Samādhi** (一行三昧): in a quiet room, sitting cross-legged, **binding conditions to the Dharma-realm, one-thought [being] the Dharma-realm, all ignorance and confusion eternally quiescent like space**.

此之一行，即是一切無礙人，一道出生死，一切諸法中，皆以等觀入，解慧心寂然，三界無倫匹，此乃一行攝一切行。

> **This one practice is precisely the unobstructed person of all, one path exiting birth-and-death.** Among all dharmas, entering through equal contemplation—the mind of liberating wisdom silent and still, within the three realms without peer. **This is one practice encompassing all practices.**

**Perfect: Increasing by Ten and Beyond**

增十數為行，攝一切行，謂十境界，或十觀成乘等。增百數、千萬億數、阿僧祇不可說法門為行，豈可具載？若得其意，例可解。

> Increasing by ten as practice, encompassing all practices: the **ten realms**, or the **ten contemplations completing the vehicle**, etc. Increasing by hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, a hundred million, asaṃkhya, unspeakable dharma-gates as practice—how could we exhaustively record them? **If one gets the meaning, by example one can understand.**

#### Coarse and Subtle Judgment

然增數明行，為行不同，須判麁妙。

> In increasing-number practices, practices being different, we must judge coarse and subtle.

若三藏增數諸行，以生滅智導，但期出苦，止息化城，是故為麁。

> **Tripiṭaka increasing-number practices**: guided by arising-and-ceasing wisdom, only expecting to exit suffering, resting at the Conjured City—**hence coarse**.

通教增數諸行，體智雖巧，但導出苦，灰斷是同。

> **Common Teaching**: though body-wisdom is skillful, it only guides exiting suffering; ashes and extinction are the same [result].

別教增數諸行，智導則遠，自淺階深，而諸行隔別，事理不融，是故為麁。

> **Distinct Teaching**: wisdom-guidance is far-reaching, ascending from shallow to deep; but practices are separated, phenomena and principle not fused—**hence coarse**.

圓教增數諸行，行融智圓，是故為妙。

> **Perfect Teaching increasing-number practices**: practice is fused, wisdom is complete—**hence subtle**.

#### Opening the Coarse

開麁論妙者，低頭舉手，積土弄砂，皆成佛道。雖說種種法，其實為一乘。諸行皆妙，無麁可待，待即絕矣。

> **Opening the coarse to discuss the subtle:** Lowering the head or raising the hand, piling earth or playing with sand—**all become the Buddha Path**. Though teaching various dharmas, actually it is for the One Vehicle. **All practices are subtle; there is no coarse to contrast—the contrast is severed.**

#### The Five Special Practices

復次，約五數明行妙者，又為二：先、明別五行，次、明圓五行。

> Further, regarding the subtle practice of the five-number: two parts—first, Distinct five practices; next, Perfect five practices.

別者，如《涅槃》云：「五種之行，謂聖行、梵行、天行、嬰兒行、病行。」

> Distinct: as the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "**Five kinds of practice:**
> 1. **Sacred Practice** (聖行)
> 2. **Pure Practice** (梵行)
> 3. **Heavenly Practice** (天行)
> 4. **Infant Practice** (嬰兒行)
> 5. **Sick Practice** (病行)"

**Sacred Practice (聖行)**

聖行有三：戒、定、慧。

> **Sacred Practice has three: discipline, concentration, wisdom.**

如經：「菩薩若聞大涅槃，聞已生信，作是思惟：諸佛世尊，有無上道，有大正法、大眾正行。」從此立行。

> As the sūtra says: "If a bodhisattva hears the Great Nirvāṇa and after hearing generates faith, thinking thus: 'All Buddha World-Honored Ones have the unsurpassed path, have the great true dharma, have the great assembly's true practice'—from this, practice is established."

「若聞大涅槃」即是信果，亦是信滅。「有無上道」已去，是信顯果之行。「無上道」是信慧；「有大正法」是信定；「大眾正行」是信戒。

> "Hearing the Great Nirvāṇa" is faith in the fruit, also faith in cessation. "Has the unsurpassed path" onward is faith in the practice revealing the fruit. "Unsurpassed path" is faith in wisdom; "great true dharma" is faith in concentration; "great assembly's true practice" is faith in discipline.

**The Ten Kinds of Discipline**

《大論》亦明十種戒：

> The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* also clarifies **ten kinds of discipline**:

不破、不缺、不穿、不雜四種...

> Not-broken, not-deficient, not-holed, not-mixed [make four]...

| # | Type | Meaning |
|---|------|---------|
| 1 | Not-broken (不破) | Root precepts intact |
| 2 | Not-deficient (不缺) | No missing aspects |
| 3 | Not-holed (不穿) | No subtle violations |
| 4 | Not-mixed (不雜) | Not polluted by wrong intentions |
| 5 | Following-the-Path (隨道) | Precepts of the path |
| 6 | Non-Attachment (無著) | Precepts without grasping |
| 7 | Praised-by-the-Wise (智所讚) | Praised by sages |
| 8 | Self-Mastery (自在) | Free and unhindered |
| 9 | Following-Concentration (隨定) | Arising from samādhi |
| 10 | Fully-Complete (具足) | All *pāramitās* contained |

#### Opening Coarse Precepts into Subtle

開麁顯妙者。他云：「《梵網》是菩薩戒。」今問：「是何等菩薩戒？」

> Opening the coarse to reveal the subtle: Others say: "The *Brahmajāla* is the bodhisattva precepts." We now ask: "Which kind of bodhisattva precepts?"

若作別、圓菩薩解者，可然。何者？三乘共眾外，別有菩薩，故別有戒。

> If understood as Distinct and Perfect bodhisattva [precepts], acceptable. Why? Outside the three-vehicle community, there are separate bodhisattvas—hence separate precepts.

開麁者，毘尼學者，即大乘學式叉。式叉即是大乘第一義光，非青、非黃、非赤白，三歸、五戒、十善、二百五十，皆是摩訶衍，豈有麁戒隔於妙戒！

> **Opening the coarse:** Those who study the Vinaya are precisely studying the Great Vehicle's *śikṣamāṇā*. *Śikṣamāṇā* is precisely the light of Great Vehicle ultimate meaning—neither blue, nor yellow, nor red, nor white. **The three refuges, five precepts, ten goods, 250 [bhikṣu rules]—all are Mahāyāna.** How could coarse precepts be separated from subtle precepts!

戒既即妙，人亦復然。「汝實我子」，即此義也。是名絕待妙戒。

> Precepts being precisely subtle, people are also thus. **"You are truly my children"**—this is that meaning. **This is called Absolute Subtle Precepts.**

### Footnotes (Part 2 of Fascicle 3)

[^f3p2-1]: The "**clear cool pond**" (清涼池) is a standard metaphor for nirvāṇa or the Buddha-realm—refreshing liberation from the burning of afflictions.

[^f3p2-2]: The "**three dots of the *i* character**" (伊字三點) refers to the Sanskrit vowel *i* (इ), which in its traditional form has three elements arranged in a triangular pattern. This became a key Tiantai symbol for the three aspects (realm, wisdom, practice) being mutually containing and non-linear—not stacked vertically or spread horizontally, but interpenetrating.

# Fascicle 4

## Part 1: Position Subtlety (位妙) — The Six Positions

### The Fourth [Subtlety]: Position Subtlety

#### Why Position After Practice

諦理既融，智圓無隔，導行成妙。三義已顯，體、宗、用足。更明位妙者，行之所階也。

> Principle-truth being fused, wisdom complete without obstruction, guiding practice to subtle—these three meanings are already revealed, encompassing substance, essence, and function. **Why further clarify Position Subtlety? Because [positions are] the stages that practice ascends.**

#### The Variety of Position Teachings

但位有權實，布在經論。

> **Positions have expedient and real [versions], spread throughout the sūtras and śāstras.**

若《成論》、《毘曇》判位，言不涉大。《地》、《攝》等論判位，別敘一途，義不兼括。

> If the *Satyasiddhi-śāstra* and *Abhidharma* determine positions, their language does not reach the great [vehicle]. The *Daśabhūmika*, *Mahāyānasaṃgraha* and other śāstras determine positions separately in one line, their meanings not mutually encompassing.

方等諸經明位，《瓔珞》已判淺深。般若諸經明位，《仁王》盛談高下而未彰麁妙。

> The various *Vaipulya* sūtras clarify positions; the *Yingluo Jing* has already determined shallow and deep. The various *Prajñā* sūtras clarify positions; the *Renwang Jing* abundantly discusses high and low yet has not manifested coarse and subtle.

今經位名不彰，而意兼小大，粗判權實...

> **This present sūtra does not manifest position names, yet its meaning encompasses small and great, roughly determining expedient and real...**

#### The Six Positions in the Medicinal Herbs Parable

今〈藥草喻品〉但明六位。

> Now the *Medicinal Herbs Parable Chapter* clarifies only **six positions**.

**Position 1-3: Small Herbs (小藥草) = Tripiṭaka**

文云：「轉輪聖王、釋、梵諸王，是小藥草。知無漏法，能得涅槃…，獨處山林，…得緣覺證，是中藥草。求世尊處，我當作佛，行精進定，是上藥草。」

> The text says: "**Wheel-turning sage kings, Indra, Brahmā and various kings—these are small herbs.** Knowing the outflow-free dharmas, able to attain nirvāṇa... dwelling alone in mountain forests... attaining Pratyekabuddha realization—**these are middle herbs.** Seeking the World-Honored One's place, 'I shall become Buddha,' practicing energetic concentration—**these are upper herbs.**"

前三義是藏中位；

> **The former three meanings are positions within the Tripiṭaka.**

**Position 4: Small Trees (小樹) = Common Teaching**

又諸佛子，專心佛道，常行慈悲，自知作佛，決定無疑，是名小樹。

> "Also the Buddha's children, single-mindedly [pursuing] the Buddha path, constantly practicing compassion, knowing themselves to become Buddha, definitely without doubt—**these are called small trees.**"

小樹是通位；

> **Small trees are Common Teaching positions.**

**Position 5: Great Trees (大樹) = Distinct Teaching**

安住神通，轉不退輪，度無量億百千眾生…，是名大樹。

> "**Abiding peacefully in supernatural powers, turning the non-regressing wheel, liberating immeasurable hundred-thousands of sentient beings...**—these are called **great trees**."

大樹是別位；

> **Great trees are Distinct Teaching positions.**

**Position 6: The Real Thing = Perfect Teaching**

追取長行中「一地所生，一雨所潤」，及後文云：「今當為汝說最實事」以為第六位也。

> Tracing back to the prose: "**One ground gives rise [to all], one rain moistens [all]**," and the later text: "**Now I shall speak the most real matter for you**"—this makes the sixth position.

最實事是圓位也。

> **"The most real matter" is the Perfect Teaching position.**

**Summary Table: Six Positions**

| Position | Chapter Symbol | Teaching | Content |
|----------|---------------|----------|---------|
| 1 | **Small Herbs** | Tripiṭaka | Human/heavenly beings |
| 2 | **Middle Herbs** | Tripiṭaka | Two Vehicles (Śrāvaka, Pratyekabuddha) |
| 3 | **Upper Herbs** | Tripiṭaka | Tripiṭaka Bodhisattvas |
| 4 | **Small Trees** | Common | Three vehicles via body-dharma |
| 5 | **Great Trees** | Distinct | Separate bodhisattva path |
| 6 | **The Real Thing** | Perfect | One Vehicle, most real |

#### Small Herbs: Human and Heavenly Positions

小草位者，人天乘也。輪王是人主位，釋梵是天主位，皆約報果明位。

> **Small herbs position is the human-heavenly vehicle.** Wheel-turning king is the human ruler position; Indra and Brahmā are celestial ruler positions. Both determine position according to retribution-fruit.

**Human Realm Positions**

人位因者，即是秉持五戒，略為四品：

> Human position causes—namely upholding the five precepts, roughly divided into four grades:

| Grade | Precept Quality | Reward |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| Lower | Basic five precepts | Iron-wheel king (one continent) |
| Middle | Moderate practice | Bronze-wheel king (two continents) |
| Upper | Strong practice | Silver-wheel king (three continents) |
| Highest | Excellent practice | Gold-wheel king (four continents) |

皆是散心持戒，兼以慈心勸他為福故，報為人主，飛行皇帝，四方歸德，神寶自然應也。

> All are scattered-mind precept keeping, combined with compassionate mind urging others to merit—hence their retribution is human rulership, a flying emperor, with the four directions returning to virtue, and divine treasures naturally responding.

**Heavenly Realm Positions**

天乘位者，修十善道，任運淳熟，通是天因，加修禪定，進升上界。

> **Heavenly vehicle positions**: cultivating the ten wholesome paths until naturally mature—this is the universal heavenly cause. Adding cultivation of meditation, one ascends to higher realms.

三界天果，高下不同，修因必深淺異也。

> The three-realm heavenly fruits differ in height—the cultivated causes necessarily differ in depth.

#### Middle Herbs: Two Vehicles

中藥草位者，即二乘也。

> **Middle herbs position is the Two Vehicles.**

**Seven Worthy Ones (七賢)**

七賢者：一、五停心。二、別相念處。三、總相念處。四、煗法。五、頂法。六、忍法。七、世第一法。

> **Seven Worthy Ones:**
> 1. Five Stilling-Hearts
> 2. Separate-aspect Mindfulness
> 3. General-aspect Mindfulness
> 4. Warmth-dharma
> 5. Summit-dharma
> 6. Patience-dharma
> 7. World-First-dharma

通稱賢者，隣聖曰賢。能以似解伏見，因似發真，故言隣聖。

> All are called "worthy" because **neighboring sagehood is called worthiness**. Able to use approximate understanding to subdue views, from the approximate to generate the true—hence called "neighboring sagehood."

**Seven Sages (七聖)**

七、聖位者：一、隨信行。二、隨法行。三、信解。四、見得。五、身證。六、時解脫羅漢。七、不時解脫羅漢。

> **Seven Sage positions:**
> 1. Following-Faith Practice
> 2. Following-Dharma Practice
> 3. Faith-Understanding
> 4. View-Attainment
> 5. Body-Witness
> 6. Time-Liberation Arhat
> 7. Non-Time-Liberation Arhat

通名聖者，正也。苦忍明發，捨凡性，入聖性。真智見理，故名聖人。

> All are called "sages" because **"sage" means correct**. When suffering-patience clarity arises, one abandons ordinary nature and enters sage nature. **True wisdom sees principle—hence called "sage."**

#### Upper Herbs: Tripiṭaka Bodhisattvas

上草位者，即是三藏菩薩位也。此菩薩從初發菩提心，起慈悲誓願，觀察四諦，以道諦為初門，行六波羅蜜。

> **Upper herbs position is the Tripiṭaka bodhisattva position.** This bodhisattva, from the initial arousing of *bodhi*-mind, generates compassionate vow-wishes, contemplates the Four Noble Truths, taking Path-truth as the initial gate, and practices the six *pāramitās*.

**The Three Incalculable Eons**

從初釋迦至罽那尸棄佛時，名第一阿僧祇劫。常離女人身，亦不自知當作佛、不作佛。

> From the initial Śākyamuni to the time of Kāśyapa Buddha, this is named the **first incalculable eon**. [The bodhisattva] constantly separates from female bodies, and does not yet know whether he will become Buddha or not.

從罽那尸棄佛至然燈佛時，名第二阿僧祇劫。爾時雖自知作佛，而口不說...

> From Kāśyapa Buddha to Dīpaṃkara Buddha, this is named the **second incalculable eon**. At that time, though knowing oneself will become Buddha, one does not speak it aloud...

從然燈佛至毘婆尸佛時，名第三阿僧祇劫。是時內心了了，自知作佛，口自發言，無所畏難。

> From Dīpaṃkara Buddha to Vipaśyin Buddha, this is named the **third incalculable eon**. At this time, the inner mind is clear; knowing oneself will become Buddha, one speaks aloud without fear or difficulty.

#### Small Trees: Common Teaching Ten Grounds

小樹位者，即是通教，明三乘之人，同以無言說道，斷煩惱，入第一義諦。

> **Small trees position is the Common Teaching**, clarifying that the three-vehicle persons **together use the wordless path, cutting afflictions, entering ultimate truth**.

體法觀慧不異，但智力強弱之殊，煩惱習有盡、不盡為異耳。

> Body-dharma contemplative wisdom is not different; only the strength and weakness of wisdom-power differs, and [whether] affliction habits are exhausted or not exhausted makes the difference.

**Common Teaching Ten Grounds**

| # | Ground | Content |
|---|--------|---------|
| 1 | **Dry Wisdom** (乾慧地) | Body-dharma mindfulness, no samādhi-water yet |
| 2 | **Nature** (性地) | Warmth through World-First-dharma |
| 3 | **Eight-Person** (八人地) | Eight patiences complete, one wisdom short |
| 4 | **Seeing** (見地) | Sees ultimate non-arising Four Truths |
| 5 | **Thin** (薄地) | Desire-realm afflictions thinned |
| 6 | **Free-from-Desire** (離欲地) | Five lower fetters exhausted |
| 7 | **Done-What-Is-To-Be-Done** (已辦地) | All three-realm afflictions cut |
| 8 | **Pratyekabuddha** (辟支佛地) | Encroaches on habitual tendencies |
| 9 | **Bodhisattva** (菩薩地) | Exits emptiness into provisional, dual observation |
| 10 | **Buddha** (佛地) | One thought completes all |

#### Great Trees: Distinct Teaching Positions

大樹位者，別教位也。此別教，名、義、理、惑、智、斷，皆別。

> **Great trees position is the Distinct Teaching position.** This Distinct Teaching—names, meanings, principle, delusion, wisdom, cutting—**all are distinct**.

此正約因緣假名、恒沙佛法、如來藏理、常住涅槃、無量四諦而論位次。

> This is precisely about **dependent-origination provisional names, Ganges-sands Buddha-dharmas, Tathāgatagarbha principle, eternal-abiding nirvāṇa, and immeasurable Four Truths**—discussing the position sequence.

**Distinct Teaching Fifty-Two Positions**

今判位名數，依《纓珞》、《仁王》者...《纓珞》五十二位，名義整足...

> Now determining position name-numbers, following the *Yingluo* and *Renwang*... The *Yingluo* [teaches] **fifty-two positions**, with complete name-meanings...

| Stage | Positions | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Ten Faiths** (十信) | 1-10 | Outer ordinary, dry wisdom, subduing patience |
| **Ten Abidings** (十住) | 11-20 | Inner ordinary, cutting interface delusion |
| **Ten Practices** (十行) | 21-30 | Exiting emptiness into provisional |
| **Ten Dedications** (十迴向) | 31-40 | Cultivating Middle Way |
| **Ten Grounds** (十地) | 41-50 | Breaking ignorance, seeing Buddha-nature |
| **Equal Awakening** (等覺) | 51 | Diamond-mind, nearly Buddha |
| **Wondrous Awakening** (妙覺) | 52 | Ultimate Buddhahood |

#### Coarse and Subtle Judgment

若開麁顯妙，無麁可待，即絕待行妙意也。

> **If we open the coarse to reveal the subtle, there is no coarse to contrast—this is the Absolute Practice Subtlety meaning.**

### Footnotes (Part 1 of Fascicle 4)

[^f4p1-1]: The **Six Positions** (六位) from the Medicinal Herbs chapter provide Master Zhiyi's framework for understanding all the different path structures across Buddhism. Just as different plants grow to different heights from the same rain, practitioners of different capacities attain different levels from the same Dharma rain.

# Fascicle 5

## Part 1: Three Dharmas Subtlety (三法妙) — The Three Tracks

### The Fifth [Subtlety]: Three Dharmas Subtlety

#### Overview

斯乃妙位所住之法也。言三法者，即三軌也。軌名軌範，還是三法可軌範耳。

> **This is the dharma in which the subtle positions abide.** The term "Three Dharmas" means the **Three Tracks** (三軌). "Track" means pattern or standard—these three dharmas can serve as patterns.

此即七意：一、總明三軌。二、歷別明三軌。三、判麁妙。四、開麁顯妙。五、明始終。六、類三法。七、悉檀料簡。

> This has **seven topics**:
> 1. General explanation of the Three Tracks
> 2. Specific explanation of the Three Tracks
> 3. Judging coarse and subtle
> 4. Opening coarse to reveal subtle
> 5. Explaining beginning and end
> 6. Classifying the Three Dharmas
> 7. Four Siddhānta analysis

#### Part 1: General Explanation of the Three Tracks

一、真性軌。二、觀照軌。三、資成軌。名雖有三，秖是一大乘法也。

> 1. **True Nature Track** (真性軌)
> 2. **Contemplative Illumination Track** (觀照軌)
> 3. **Resource Accomplishment Track** (資成軌)

> Though the names are three, **they are only the one Great Vehicle dharma**.

**The Three Names for the One Vehicle**

經曰：「十方諦求，更無餘乘，唯一佛乘」。一佛乘即具三法，亦名第一義諦，亦名第一義空，亦名如來藏。

> The sūtra says: "Seeking in the ten directions, there is no other vehicle—**only the One Buddha Vehicle**." The One Buddha Vehicle contains these three dharmas:
> - Also named **Ultimate Truth** (第一義諦)
> - Also named **Ultimate Emptiness** (第一義空)
> - Also named **Tathāgatagarbha** (如來藏)

**Not Three, Not One**

此三不定三，三而論一。一不定一，一而論三，不可思議，不並不別，伊字、天目。

> **These three are not definitely three**—discussing three, we speak of one. **One is not definitely one**—discussing one, we speak of three. Inconceivable, neither parallel nor separate—like the **three dots of the *i* character** (伊字) or the **heavenly eye** (天目).

故《大經》云：「佛性者，亦一、非一、非一非非一。亦一者，一切眾生悉一乘故。」此語第一義諦。「非一者，如是數法故。」此語如來藏。「非一非非一，數、非數法，不決定故。」此語第一義空。

> Hence the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "Buddha-nature is '**also one, non-one, neither-one-nor-non-one**.'
> - 'Also one' means all sentient beings are entirely One Vehicle"—this refers to **Ultimate Truth**.
> - "'Non-one' means such enumerable dharmas"—this refers to **Tathāgatagarbha**.
> - "'Neither-one-nor-non-one' means enumerable and non-enumerable dharmas are not fixed"—this refers to **Ultimate Emptiness**.

**Correspondence with Previous Subtleties**

前明諸諦，若開、若合，若麁、若妙等，已是真性軌相也。前明諸智，若開、若合，若麁、若妙，是觀照軌相也。前明諸行，若開、若合，若麁、若妙，已是資成軌相也。

> **Previous [discussions of] all truths—opening or closing, coarse or subtle—are already the mark of the True Nature Track.**
> **Previous [discussions of] all wisdoms—opening or closing, coarse or subtle—are the mark of the Contemplative Illumination Track.**
> **Previous [discussions of] all practices—opening or closing, coarse or subtle—are already the mark of the Resource Accomplishment Track.**

前明諸位，秖是修此三法所證之果耳。

> **Previous [discussions of] all positions are simply the fruits attained from cultivating these three dharmas.**

#### Part 4: The Perfect Teaching's Three Dharmas

以真性軌為乘體。不偽名真，不改名性，即正因常住，諸佛所師，謂此法也。

> **Taking the True Nature Track as the vehicle-body.** "Not false" is called "true"; "not changing" is called "nature." This is the **constant-abiding right cause**—what all Buddhas take as teacher—this is that dharma.

一切眾生亦悉一乘，眾生即涅槃相，不可復滅；涅槃即生死，無滅不生。

> All sentient beings are also entirely One Vehicle. **Sentient beings are precisely the mark of nirvāṇa**—there is nothing more to extinguish. **Nirvāṇa is precisely birth-and-death**—no extinction, no arising.

故《大品》云：「是乘不動、不出。」即此乘也。

> Hence the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā* says: "**This vehicle neither moves nor exits.**" This is that vehicle.

**Contemplative Illumination Track**

觀照者，秖點真性，寂而常照，便是觀照，即是第一義空。

> **Contemplative Illumination**: simply pointing to true nature, quiescent yet constantly illuminating—this is Contemplative Illumination, which is **Ultimate Emptiness**.

**Resource Accomplishment Track**

資成者，秖點真性法界，含藏諸行，無量眾具，即如來藏。

> **Resource Accomplishment**: simply pointing to the true-nature Dharma-realm, containing and storing all practices, immeasurable implements—this is **Tathāgatagarbha**.

**The Wish-Fulfilling Jewel**

三法不一異，如點如意珠中論光、論寶，光、寶不與珠一，不與珠異，不縱不橫。三法亦如是，亦一、亦非一，亦非一非非一，不可思議之三法也。

> **The three dharmas are neither one nor different.** Like pointing to a wish-fulfilling jewel and discussing its light and treasure—light and treasure are not one with the jewel, not different from the jewel, **not vertical, not horizontal**. The three dharmas are also thus: also one, also non-one, also neither-one-nor-non-one—**inconceivable three dharmas**.

**The Three Obstacles**

若迷此三法，即成三障：

> **If one is confused about these three dharmas, they become the three obstacles:**

| Dharma Confused | Obstacle | What It Blocks |
|-----------------|----------|----------------|
| Tathāgatagarbha | Dust-and-sand (塵沙) | Innumerable dharma-gates |
| Ultimate Emptiness | View-and-thought (見思) | Liberation |
| Ultimate Truth | Root Ignorance (無明) | Buddha-nature realization |

**Revealing the Three Dharmas**

若即塵沙障達無量法門者，即資成軌得顯。若即見思障達第一義空者，觀照軌得顯。若即無明障達第一義諦者，真性軌得顯。

> If through dust-and-sand obstacles one comprehends innumerable dharma-gates—**Resource Accomplishment Track is revealed**.
> If through view-and-thought obstacles one comprehends Ultimate Emptiness—**Contemplative Illumination Track is revealed**.
> If through root ignorance obstacle one comprehends Ultimate Truth—**True Nature Track is revealed**.

真性軌得顯，名為法身。觀照得顯，名為般若。資成得顯，名為解脫。

> **True Nature Track revealed is called Dharma-body.**
> **Contemplative Illumination revealed is called Prajñā.**
> **Resource Accomplishment revealed is called Liberation.**

此兩即是定慧莊嚴，莊嚴法身。法身是乘體，定慧是眾具。

> These two are concentration-and-wisdom adornments, adorning the Dharma-body. **Dharma-body is the vehicle-body; concentration-and-wisdom are the implements.**

#### Classifying the Three Dharmas

六、類通三法者...類通諸三法。何者？赴緣名異，得意義同，粗通十條，餘者可領。

> Classifying and penetrating the Three Dharmas... What are they? **Meeting conditions, names differ; grasping the meaning, the significance is the same.** Roughly penetrating ten categories, the rest can be understood.

**The Ten Three-Dharmas**

| # | Category | True Nature | Contemplative Illumination | Resource Accomplishment |
|---|----------|-------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | **Three Paths** (三道) | Suffering Path | Affliction Path | Karma Path |
| 2 | **Three Consciousnesses** (三識) | Amala | Ālaya | Ādāna |
| 3 | **Three Buddha-Natures** (三佛性) | Right Cause | Understanding Cause | Condition Cause |
| 4 | **Three Prajñās** (三般若) | Reality-mark | Contemplative | Literary |
| 5 | **Three Bodhis** (三菩提) | Reality-mark | Real-wisdom | Skillful-means |
| 6 | **Three Great Vehicles** (三大乘) | Principle Vehicle | Following Vehicle | Attainment Vehicle |
| 7 | **Three Bodies** (三身) | Dharma-body | Reward-body | Response-body |
| 8 | **Three Nirvāṇas** (三涅槃) | Nature-Purity | Perfect-Purity | Skillful-Purity |
| 9 | **One-Essence Three Jewels** (一體三寶) | Dharma | Buddha | Sangha |
| 10 | **Three Virtues** (三德) | Dharma-body | Prajñā | Liberation |

**Type-Penetrating the Three Paths**

三道即三軌。苦道即真性者，下文云：「世間相常住」，豈不即彼生死而是法身耶？

> The Three Paths are the Three Tracks. **Suffering Path is True Nature**: the text below says "worldly marks are eternally abiding"—is not birth-and-death precisely Dharma-body?

煩惱即觀照，觀照本照惑，無惑則無照...即煩惱是觀照也。

> **Affliction is Contemplative Illumination**: contemplative illumination fundamentally illuminates delusion; without delusion, there is no illumination... thus affliction is contemplative illumination.

資成即業道者，惡是善資，無惡亦無善。

> **Resource Accomplishment is Karma Path**: evil is the resource for good; without evil, there is no good either.

**Type-Penetrating the Three Buddha-Natures**

三佛性者，真性軌即是正因性；觀照軌即是了因性；資成軌即是緣因性。

> **Three Buddha-Natures**: True Nature Track is **Right-Cause Nature**; Contemplative Illumination Track is **Understanding-Cause Nature**; Resource Accomplishment Track is **Condition-Cause Nature**.

故下文云：「汝實我子；我實汝父。」即正因性。

> Hence the text below says: "**You are truly my children; I am truly your father**"—this is Right-Cause Nature.

又云：「我昔教汝無上道故，一切智願猶在不失。」智即了因性，願即緣因性。

> Also: "Because I formerly taught you the unsurpassed path, **your all-knowledge vow still remains, not lost**." Wisdom is Understanding-Cause Nature; vow is Condition-Cause Nature.

**Type-Penetrating the Three Virtues**

十、類通三德者，《大經》三德，共成大涅槃。此經三軌，共成大乘。

> Type-penetrating the **Three Virtues**: The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*'s Three Virtues together complete Great Nirvāṇa. This sūtra's Three Tracks together complete the Great Vehicle.

彼明法身德，此云實相。彼處明般若德；此經明其智慧門難解難入。彼經明解脫德；此經明數數示現...

> That [sūtra] clarifies Dharma-body virtue; this says Reality-mark. That clarifies Prajñā virtue; this sūtra clarifies that the wisdom-gate is difficult to understand, difficult to enter. That sūtra clarifies Liberation virtue; this sūtra clarifies repeated manifestation...

**Summary: The Architecture of Three Dharmas**

| Track | Source | Obstacle | Virtue | Body |
|-------|--------|----------|--------|------|
| **True Nature** | Ultimate Truth | Root Ignorance | Dharma-body | Dharma-body |
| **Contemplative Illumination** | Ultimate Emptiness | View-and-Thought | Prajñā | Reward-body |
| **Resource Accomplishment** | Tathāgatagarbha | Dust-and-Sand | Liberation | Response-body |

### Footnotes (Part 1 of Fascicle 5)

[^f5p1-1]: The **Three Tracks** (三軌) represent Master Zhiyi's synthesis of the entire Buddha-dharma into three interpenetrating aspects. They correspond to: the reality that is realized (True Nature), the wisdom that realizes (Contemplative Illumination), and the practice that enables realization (Resource Accomplishment). These three are neither one nor different—like the light and treasure of a wish-fulfilling jewel.

# Fascicle 6

## Part 1: Resonance Subtlety (感應妙) — Machine and Response

### The Sixth [Subtlety]: Resonance Subtlety

#### Why Resonance After Three Dharmas

上來四妙名為圓因，三法祕藏名為圓果...果智寂照，有感必彰，故明感應妙也。

> The previous four subtleties are called **Perfect Causes**; the Three Dharmas Secret Treasury is called **Perfect Fruit**...
> **Fruit-wisdom is quiescent-yet-illuminating; when there is a stimulus, it must manifest response**—hence we clarify Resonance Subtlety.

#### Six Topics

即為六：一、釋感應名。二、明相。三、明同異。四、明相對。五、明麁妙。六、明觀心。

> This has **six topics**:
> 1. Explaining the names "stimulus" and "response"
> 2. Explaining their marks
> 3. Explaining sameness and difference
> 4. Explaining correspondence
> 5. Explaining coarse and subtle
> 6. Explaining mind-contemplation

#### Explaining the Names

**Three Meanings of "Machine" (機)**

機有三義：

> **"Machine"** (機, stimulus/capacity) has three meanings:

**1. Machine = Subtle (微)**

一者、機是微義。故《易》云：「機者，動之微，吉之先現。」

> First, machine means **subtle**. Hence the *Yijing* says: "The machine is **subtlety of movement, the forerunner of fortune**."

又《阿含》云：「眾生有善法之機，聖人來應也。」

> Also the *Āgama* says: "Sentient beings have a machine of wholesome dharmas; **the sage comes to respond**."

如弩有可發之機，故射者發之，發之則箭動，不發則不前；眾生有可生之善，故聖應則善生，不應則不生。

> Like a crossbow has a triggerable machine—hence the archer triggers it: triggered, the arrow moves; not triggered, it stays still. Sentient beings have producible good; hence **when the sage responds, good arises; without response, it does not arise**.

**2. Machine = Hinge/Gate (關)**

二者、《古注楞伽經》云：「機是關義。」何者？眾生有善有惡，關聖慈悲，故機是關義也。

> Second, the *Ancient Commentary on the Laṅkāvatāra* says: "Machine means **hinge/gate**." Why? Sentient beings have good and evil that **hinge upon the sage's compassion**—hence machine means gate.

**3. Machine = Suitability (宜)**

三者、機是宜義。如欲拔無明之苦，正宜於悲；欲與法性之樂，正宜於慈，故機是宜義也。

> Third, machine means **suitability**. If one wishes to uproot ignorance-suffering, this is precisely suitable to compassion. If one wishes to give dharma-nature joy, this is precisely suitable to loving-kindness. Hence **machine means suitability**.

**Three Meanings of "Response" (應)**

次明應者，亦為三義：

> Next, explaining **"response"** (應) also has three meanings:

**1. Response = Going-to (赴)**

一者、應是赴義。既言機有可生之理，機微將動，聖人赴之，其善得生，故用赴而釋應。

> First, response means **going-to**. Since we say the machine has a principle of producibility, when the machine subtly stirs, **the sage goes to it and good arises**—hence we explain response as "going-to."

**2. Response = Matching (對)**

二者、應是對義。如人交關，更相主對，若一欲賣，一不欲買，則不相主對；若賣買兩和，則貿易交決...

> Second, response means **matching**. Like people doing business, mutually corresponding—if one wants to sell but the other doesn't want to buy, they don't correspond. If both buyer and seller agree, the trade is completed...

今以眾生譬買，如來譬賣，就機以論關，就應以論對，故以對釋應也。

> Now, taking sentient beings as buyer and Tathāgata as seller—**regarding machine we discuss the hinge; regarding response we discuss the match**—hence we explain response as "matching."

**3. Response = Responding (應)**

三者、應是應義。既言機是於宜，宜何等法？應以慈悲之法，是善惡所宜。

> Third, response means **responding**. Since we say machine is suitability, suitable for what dharma? **Responding with compassion-dharmas that suit good and evil**.

#### Marks of Stimulus and Response

**Good and Evil as Machine**

若善惡為機，為單？為共？...或取善惡相帶為機者，從闡提起改悔心，上至等覺，皆有善惡相帶，故得為機。

> If good and evil are machines, are they single or combined?... Taking **good and evil interlinked** as machine: from icchantika arising repentant mind up to Equal Awakening, all have good and evil interlinked—hence they can be machines.

**Three Worlds of Machine**

眾生善惡有三世，何世為機？...通論，三世善惡皆為機；別論，但取未來善惡為正機也。何者？過去已謝，現在已定，秖為拔未來惡，生未來善耳。

> Sentient beings' good and evil have three times—which time is the machine?... **Generally speaking, three-times good and evil are all machines. Specifically speaking, only future good and evil are the primary machines.** Why? The past has passed, the present is fixed—it is only for **uprooting future evil and producing future good**.

#### Different Types of Stimulus-Response

**The Four Sentences (四句)**

今略言為四：

> Now speaking briefly as **four**:

| # | Type | Description |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Hidden machine, hidden response** (冥機冥應) | Past good activates; no visible miracle, but secretly benefited by Dharma-body |
| 2 | **Hidden machine, manifest response** (冥機顯應) | Past good ripens; now meets Buddha, hears Dharma, obtains benefit |
| 3 | **Manifest machine, manifest response** (顯機顯應) | Present practice is vigorous; obtains visible spiritual response |
| 4 | **Manifest machine, hidden response** (顯機冥應) | Present practice is strong but no visible response; hidden benefit |

**Hidden Machine, Hidden Response (冥機冥應)**

若過去善修三業，現在未運身口，藉往善力名此為冥機也。雖不現見靈應，而密為法身所益。不見不聞而覺而知，是名為冥益也。

> If in the past one cultivated the three karmas in wholesome ways, and in the present has not yet activated body and speech, relying on past wholesome power—this is called **hidden machine**. Though one does not visibly see spiritual response, one is **secretly benefited by Dharma-body**. Not seeing, not hearing, yet awakening and knowing—this is called **hidden benefit**.

**Hidden Machine, Manifest Response (冥機顯應)**

冥機顯益者，過去殖善而冥機已成，便得值佛聞法，現前獲利是為顯益。

> **Hidden machine, manifest benefit**: Past-planted good makes the hidden machine complete; one then **meets Buddha, hears Dharma, obtains benefit in the present**—this is manifest benefit.

如佛初出世，最初得度之人，現在何甞修行？諸佛照其宿機，自往度之，即其義也。

> When the Buddha first appeared in the world, the first people to be liberated—had they cultivated in the present? **Buddhas illuminate their past machines and go to liberate them**—this is that meaning.

**Manifest Machine, Manifest Response (顯機顯應)**

顯機顯應者，現在身口，精勤不懈，而能感降。如須達長跪，佛往祇洹，月蓋曲躬，聖居門閫。

> **Manifest machine, manifest response**: Present body and speech are diligently tireless, and able to evoke descent. Like Sudatta kneeling long, Buddha went to Jetavana. Like Candrachatra bowing, the sage resided at his door.

如即行人，道場禮懺，能感靈瑞，即是顯機顯應也。

> Like practitioners in the practice-hall performing repentance, **able to evoke spiritual auspiciousness**—this is manifest machine, manifest response.

**Manifest Machine, Hidden Response (顯機冥應)**

顯機冥應者，如人雖一世勤苦，現善濃積而不顯感，冥有其利，此是顯機冥益。

> **Manifest machine, hidden response**: Like a person who toils diligently their whole life, present good thickly accumulated but no manifest response—**there is hidden benefit**—this is manifest machine, hidden benefit.

**The Practical Takeaway**

若解四意，一切低頭舉手，福不虛棄，終日無感，終日無悔。

> **If you understand these four meanings, every bow of the head and raising of the hand—merit is not discarded in vain. Though all day without visible response, all day without regret.**

若見喜殺壽長，好施貧乏，不生邪見；若不解此者，謂其徒功喪計，憂悔失理。

> If you see those who enjoy killing yet live long, or those who love giving yet are impoverished—**do not generate wrong views**. If one doesn't understand this, one thinks one's efforts are wasted and regrets losing principle.

**Thirty-Six Sentences (三十六句)**

若具足辨者，用四機為根本，所謂冥機、顯機、亦冥亦顯機、非冥非顯機。

> If we fully analyze, we use **four machines as roots**: hidden, manifest, both hidden-and-manifest, neither hidden-nor-manifest.

冥是過去，顯是現在，冥顯是過現，非冥非顯是未來。

> **Hidden is past; manifest is present; both is past-and-present; neither is future.**

於一句中，復為四句...四四即成十六句。機既召應，應亦有十六句。

> Within one sentence, there are again four sentences... Four times four makes **sixteen sentences**. Machine calls response; response also has sixteen sentences.

一機而感四應，一應而赴四機，機應各為十六，合成三十二句。就前根本四句，便是三十六句機應也。

> **One machine stimulates four responses; one response goes to four machines**—machine and response each are sixteen, combining to make thirty-two sentences. Adding the root four sentences makes **thirty-six sentences of stimulus-response**.

#### Coarse and Subtle

**Machine Coarse and Subtle**

九界機為麁，佛界機為妙。麁機召方便應...

> **Nine-realm machines are coarse; Buddha-realm machine is subtle.** Coarse machines call skillful-means responses...

妙機召究竟妙應，妙機亦有生、熟；妙應亦有淺、深。

> **Subtle machines call ultimate subtle responses**; subtle machines also have unripe and ripe; subtle responses also have shallow and deep.

**Response Coarse and Subtle**

三藏、通教等聖，亦得有應，但是作意神通，譬如圖畫，經紀乃成，覈論無本。何者？灰身滅智，無常住本，約何起應？

> Tripiṭaka and Common Teaching sages also have responses, but these are **intentional supernatural powers**—like paintings that require deliberate effort to complete, at core without foundation. Why? **Ash-body, extinguished-wisdom—no constant-abiding foundation—from what does response arise?**

若別、圓兩教，初心伏惑，未能有應。初地、初住三觀現前，證二十五三昧。法身清淨，無染如虛空，湛然應一切，無思無念隨機即對。

> If Distinct and Perfect teachings, the initial mind subdues delusion but cannot yet have response. At first ground or first abiding, when the three contemplations are present, one realizes the twenty-five samādhis. **Dharma-body is pure, undefiled like empty space, tranquil yet responding to all, without thought or intention, immediately matching the machine.**

**The Mirror Simile**

如一月不降，百水不升，而隨河短長，任器規矩，無前無後一時普現，此是不思議妙應也。

> Like the one moon does not descend, the hundred waters do not rise, yet **following rivers' length, conforming to vessels' shapes, without before or after, simultaneously universally manifesting**—this is **inconceivable subtle response**.

又如明鏡，表裏清澈，一像千像，無所簡擇，不須功力，任運像似，是名妙應。

> Also like a **bright mirror**, clear inside and out, one image or a thousand images, **no selection, no effort required, naturally resembling**—this is called subtle response.

#### Opening Coarse to Reveal Subtle

今經無量還為一，此則開權顯實，秖麁是妙。

> This sūtra returns the immeasurable to one—this is **opening expedient to reveal real; the coarse itself is subtle**.

如三草、二木，秖是一地所生，即是同源機一。一雨所潤，即是同受應一。

> Like three grasses and two trees, they are simply **produced from one ground—same-source machine is one**. Moistened by one rain—**same-received response is one**.

愚者未解，謂草木四微，永非是地；智者了達四微生秖是地變，四微滅秖是地還，豈有草木而非於地耶！

> The foolish don't understand, thinking grasses and trees' four elements are forever not the ground. **The wise thoroughly comprehend**: four elements arising is simply ground transforming; four elements ceasing is simply returning to ground—**how could grass and trees not be the ground?**

此即開權而顯實，決了聲聞法，是諸經之王。九法界機，皆佛界機；四聖之應，無非妙應也。

> This is **opening expedient to reveal real**, definitively clarifying śrāvaka dharma—this is the king of sūtras. **Nine-realm machines are all Buddha-realm machines; responses of the four sages are nothing but subtle responses.**

**Summary Table: Four Sentences of Resonance**

| Type | Machine | Response | Example |
|------|---------|----------|---------|
| 冥機冥應 | Past good (hidden) | Dharma-body benefit (hidden) | Not seeing Buddha, yet awakening |
| 冥機顯應 | Past good (hidden) | Meeting Buddha (manifest) | First disciples at Buddha's arising |
| 顯機顯應 | Present practice (manifest) | Visible miracle (manifest) | Sudatta and Jetavana |
| 顯機冥應 | Present practice (manifest) | Hidden benefit only | Lifelong practice, no visible sign |

### Footnotes (Part 1 of Fascicle 6)

[^f6p1-1]: The **Four Sentences** (四句) of resonance are Master Zhiyi's analysis of how spiritual practice relates to spiritual response. This teaching is profoundly pastoral: it explains why sincere practitioners may not see visible results (hidden response to manifest machine), and why unexpected transformations occur (manifest response to hidden machine). The key teaching: "Every bow of the head—merit is not discarded in vain."

---

## Part 2: Supernatural Powers Subtlety (神通妙) — The Three Wheels

### The Seventh [Subtlety]: Supernatural Powers Subtlety

#### Why Supernatural Powers After Resonance

前論機應，止是辨其可生、可赴之相；若正論化用益他，即是三輪不思議化：謂身輪、口輪、他心輪。

> Previously we discussed stimulus-response—simply analyzing the marks of what can arise and what can be approached. Now we **directly discuss transformative function benefiting others**—these are the **Three Wheels of Inconceivable Transformation**: Body-wheel, Speech-wheel, and Other-mind-wheel.

#### The Three Wheels

〈普門品〉但有二文，而兼得三意。「遊於娑婆世界」即是身輪；「而為說法」即是口輪。如見蓮華大，知池水深；若見說法大，則知智慧大。故兩輪兼示他心輪也。

> The *Universal Gateway Chapter* has only two texts but encompasses three meanings:
> - "**Roaming in the Sahā world**" is the **Body-wheel**
> - "**Expounding the Dharma for them**" is the **Speech-wheel**
> 
> Like seeing a large lotus and knowing the pond is deep—if one sees great Dharma-exposition, one knows wisdom is great. Hence **two wheels imply the Mind-wheel**.

#### Six Types of Supernatural Powers

今且依六種：謂天眼、天耳、他心、宿命、如意身通、無漏等也。

> Now following the **six types**: heavenly-eye, heavenly-ear, other-mind-knowledge, past-life-knowledge, supernormal-body-transformation, and outflow-free powers.

#### What Is "Supernatural"?

此六皆稱神通者，如《瓔珞》云：「神名天心，通名慧性。」天心者，天然之心也。慧性者，通達無礙也。

> All six are called "supernatural powers." The *Yingluo Jing* says: "**'Supernatural' means heavenly mind; 'powers' means wisdom-nature.**"
> - **Heavenly mind** = natural mind
> - **Wisdom-nature** = penetrating without obstruction

《毘曇》亦云障通，無知若去即發慧性也。當知天然慧性與六法相應，即能轉變自在，故名神通。

> The *Abhidharma* also says: "When obstructions are penetrated and ignorance is removed, wisdom-nature arises." When **natural wisdom-nature corresponds with the six dharmas**, one can **transform freely**—hence called supernatural powers.

**Real Transformation vs. Illusion**

《釋論》云：「幻術事是虛誑法，法於草木，誑惑人眼，物實不變。」神通不爾，實得變法，使物實變...

> The *Śāstra* says: "**Magical arts are deceptive dharmas**—they work on grass and trees, deceiving human eyes, but things don't actually change." **Supernatural powers are not like this**—they really transform dharmas, making things actually change...

如地有成水之理，水有成地之義。若金、銀得火則融，水遇寒則結；火、寒是融、結法。結則實結，融則實融；若得天然慧性，則實能如此變用自在。

> Like earth has the principle of becoming water; water has the principle of becoming earth. When gold or silver meets fire, they melt; when water meets cold, it freezes. Fire and cold are melting and freezing dharmas. **Freezing is real freezing; melting is real melting**—when one attains natural wisdom-nature, one can **truly transform freely** like this.

#### Supernatural Powers Across Teachings

諸教神通不同：

> Supernatural powers differ across teachings:

| Teaching | Type of Powers | Description |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Ghosts/Spirits** | Karmic-retribution | Born with powers |
| **Humans** | Medicine-induced | Through herbs/alchemy |
| **Externalists** | Root-meditation | From fundamental dhyāna |
| **Tripiṭaka** | Abandonment-based | Through eight liberations |
| **Common** | Body-dharma-based | Through instant-emptiness wisdom |
| **Distinct** | Sequential | Pre-ground: five powers; ground-entry: true outflow-free |
| **Perfect** | Non-intentional | Middle-way powers arising naturally |

**Perfect Teaching Supernatural Powers**

圓教通者，依今經及《普賢觀》，以鼻、舌兩根，以為六數。

> **Perfect Teaching powers**: According to this sūtra and the *Samantabhadra Contemplation*, the nose and tongue roots are counted among the six.

六根皆智慧，即互用意也。

> **All six roots are wisdom**—this is the meaning of mutual function.

今云六根之通，不因事禪而發，此乃中道之真。真自有通，任運成就，不須作意，故名無記化化禪。

> Now we say the **powers of six roots do not arise from mundane dhyāna**—this is the **truth of the Middle Way**. The truth itself has penetration, **naturally accomplished without intentional effort**—hence called "neutral transformation-upon-transformation dhyāna."

**The Distinction of Perfect Powers**

論其修習，皆緣實相常住之理。文云：「得是常眼根清淨。」既言是常，即本性清淨；常性無垢染。

> Discussing their cultivation: **all condition reality-mark constant-abiding principle**. The text says: "Attaining this constant eye-root purity." Since it says "constant," it refers to **originally-pure nature**; constant nature has no defilement.

彼者於佛為自，於眾生為彼；眾生謂為無常，於如來是常也。減修者，依禪而修，名為減脩；依實相修，名無減修。

> "That one" refers to Buddha as self, to sentient beings as other. Sentient beings consider it impermanent; **for the Tathāgata it is constant**. "Diminished cultivation" means depending on dhyāna—called diminished cultivation. **Depending on reality-mark is undiminished cultivation**.

#### Coarse and Subtle Powers

**Coarse Powers**

三藏、通教等聖...悉名為麁。譬如圖畫，盡思竭力，終不似真，名之為麁。

> Tripiṭaka and Common Teaching sages... are all called **coarse**. Like a **painting**—exhausting thought and effort, ultimately not resembling the real—this is called coarse.

**Subtle Powers**

若明鏡寫容，任運相似，名之為妙。方便神通，譬如麁畫；中道任運，即對即應，譬於淨鏡，故為妙也。

> Like a **bright mirror reflecting form**—naturally resembling—this is called subtle. **Expedient supernatural powers are like a coarse painting; Middle-Way natural powers are like a pure mirror**—hence subtle.

#### Supernatural Powers in the Five Flavors

五味教中用神通者：

| Flavor | Powers Usage |
|--------|--------------|
| **Milk** (*Avataṃsaka*) | One coarse, one subtle |
| **Curds** (*Tripiṭaka*) | One coarse only |
| **Fresh Butter** (*Vaipulya*) | Three coarse, one subtle |
| **Clarified Butter** (*Prajñā*) | Two coarse, one subtle |
| **Ghee** (*Lotus Sūtra*) | **One subtle only** |

此經神力，若多若少，唯為一妙。

> **This sūtra's supernatural powers, whether many or few, are solely for the one subtle.**

#### Ten Auspicious Signs in the Opening Chapter

所以〈序品〉中瑞相有十，咸皆表妙也：

> The *Introduction Chapter*'s ten auspicious signs **all express subtlety**:

| # | Sign | Represents |
|---|------|------------|
| 1 | "Ground entirely purified" | **Realm Subtlety** |
| 2 | "Light emitted between brows" | **Wisdom Subtlety** |
| 3 | "Entering samādhi" | **Practice Subtlety** |
| 4 | "Heaven raining four flowers" | **Position Subtlety** |
| 5 | "Sandalwood fragrant wind" | **Vehicle Subtlety** |
| 6 | "Four assemblies all had doubt" | **Machine** |
| 7 | "Seeing 18,000 lands" | **Response** |
| 8 | "Ground shaking six ways" | **Supernatural Powers Subtlety** |
| 9 | "Heavenly drum self-sounding" + "Dharma expounded" | **Dharma-exposition Subtlety** |
| 10 | "Dragons/gods greatly rejoicing" | **Retinue Subtlety** |
| 11 | "Seeing Buddha-children cultivating various practices" | **Benefits Subtlety** |

文云：「今佛入于三昧，是不可思議！現希有事！」現希有事，是妙神通也。

> The text says: "Now the Buddha enters samādhi—this is inconceivable! Manifesting rare events!" **Manifesting rare events is subtle supernatural powers.**

#### Opening Coarse to Reveal Subtle

今經非但妙者為妙，亦無復有麁，絓是前來諸麁，悉皆決了，為一平等大慧妙法門也。

> **This sūtra not only has subtle as subtle, but also has no more coarse.** All previous coarseness is thoroughly clarified—becoming the **one equal great-wisdom subtle dharma-gate**.

唯一大佛事因緣，曾無他事，假同九界神通。眾生，自謂他事；於佛，常是佛事。客作自謂賤人；長者審知是子。

> **Only the one great Buddha-matter cause-and-condition**—never any other matter. Even seemingly matching nine-realm supernatural powers: sentient beings consider them other matters; **for Buddha, they are always Buddha-matters**. The guest-laborer considers himself lowly; the elder truly knows he is his son.

### Footnotes (Part 2 of Fascicle 6)

[^f6p2-1]: The **Three Wheels** (輪) of transformation—body, speech, and mind—represent the Buddha's three modes of teaching. The wheel metaphor suggests constant turning/activity and the ability to crush obstacles. Master Zhiyi emphasizes that subtle supernatural powers arise naturally from Middle-Way realization, unlike the intentional effort required for coarse powers.


## Part 3: Dharma-Exposition Subtlety (說法妙) — The Twelve Divisions

### The Eighth [Subtlety]: Dharma-Exposition Subtlety

#### Why Dharma-Exposition After Supernatural Powers

諸法不可示，言辭相寂滅；有因緣故，亦可說示。前藥、珠二身，先以定動，今毒天二鼓，後以慧拔...

> **Dharmas cannot be shown; the mark of verbal expression is quiescence.** Yet due to causes and conditions, they can also be explained and shown. Previously the two bodies of medicine-tree and wish-fulfilling jewel—first, with samādhi stirring. Now the two drums of poison and heavenly—afterward, with wisdom uprooting...

演說一乘，無三差別，皆悉到於一切智地。其所說法，皆實不虛，是故次說法妙。

> **Expounding the One Vehicle**, without threefold distinction, all reaching the ground of all-knowledge. What is spoken is **all real, not empty**—hence we next discuss Dharma-Exposition Subtlety.

#### Six Topics

即為六意：一、釋法名。二、分大小。三、對緣同異。四、判所詮。五、明麁妙。六、明觀心。

> This has **six topics**:
> 1. Explaining the dharma-name
> 2. Distinguishing great and small
> 3. Correspondence with conditions: same and different
> 4. Determining what is expressed
> 5. Clarifying coarse and subtle
> 6. Clarifying mind-contemplation

#### The Twelve Divisions of Scripture

三世佛法雖多無量，十二部經收罄無不盡。

> Though **three-world Buddha-dharma is immeasurably vast**, the **Twelve Divisions of Scripture collect it completely without remainder**.

**The Twelve Divisions**

| # | Sanskrit | Chinese | Meaning |
|---|----------|---------|---------|
| 1 | **Sūtra** | 脩多羅 | Line-scripture; direct exposition |
| 2 | **Geya** | 祇夜 | Repeated verses (restating prose) |
| 3 | **Vyākaraṇa** | 和伽羅那 | Prophecy/prediction |
| 4 | **Gāthā** | 伽陀 | Non-repeated verses (independent) |
| 5 | **Udāna** | 優陀那 | Unprompted sayings |
| 6 | **Nidāna** | 尼陀那 | Cause/occasion narratives |
| 7 | **Avadāna** | 阿波陀那 | Parables/similes |
| 8 | **Itivṛttaka** | 伊帝目多伽 | Thus-it-was stories |
| 9 | **Jātaka** | 闍陀伽 | Birth stories |
| 10 | **Vaipulya** | 毘佛略 | Extensive/broad teaching |
| 11 | **Adbhutadharma** | 阿浮陀達摩 | Marvelous events |
| 12 | **Upadeśa** | 優波提舍 | Doctrinal exposition |

**Distinguishing Great and Small**

此經指九部為入大之本，則九部是小，三部是大...通而為言，小亦有記莂六道因果。

> This sūtra indicates **nine divisions as the basis for entering the great**—hence nine divisions are small, three divisions are great... Speaking comprehensively, even the small has prophecies of six-path causes and effects.

當知小乘，通具十二部也。

> Know that **Hīnayāna also comprehensively possesses all twelve divisions**.

#### The *Lotus Sūtra*'s Twelve Divisions Made Subtle

五、正就此經明妙十二部者：

> Now directly clarifying this sūtra's **subtle twelve divisions**:

**Sūtra Subtlety**

如脩多羅名直說，今經直說中道佛之智慧；不說六道、二乘、菩薩等法，唯說佛法，故直說為妙。

> Sūtra means direct exposition. **This sūtra directly expounds Middle-Way Buddha-wisdom**; not explaining six-path, Two Vehicle, bodhisattva dharmas—**only Buddha-dharma**—hence direct exposition is subtle.

**Geya (Repeated Verses) Subtlety**

祇夜妙者，重頌長行中道之說耳，故知祇夜亦妙。

> Geya subtlety: **restating in verse the prose Middle-Way teaching**—hence geya is also subtle.

**Gāthā (Independent Verses) Subtlety**

伽陀者，如龍女獻珠，喜見說偈，孤然特起。此偈明於剎那頃便成正覺...故知孤起伽陀妙也。

> Gāthā: Like **Dragon Girl offering the pearl**, Gladly-Seen speaking verses—standing alone and distinct. These verses clarify **becoming fully awakened in an instant**... hence independent gāthā is subtle.

**Vyākaraṇa (Prophecy) Subtlety**

授記妙者，授三根佛記，皆安住實智中，為天人所敬，即授記妙也。

> Vyākaraṇa subtlety: **Giving Buddha-prophecy to three roots** [sharp, medium, dull], all **abiding in real wisdom**, respected by gods and humans—this is prophecy subtlety.

**Vaipulya (Extensive) Subtlety**

方廣妙者，其車高廣，智慧深遠等，即是方廣妙也。

> Vaipulya subtlety: "**The carriage is high and broad**," wisdom deep and far-reaching—this is extensive subtlety.

#### Opening Coarse to Reveal Subtle

開麁顯妙者，昔十二、十一、九部不說實者；今無別實，異昔不實。昔但言廣，不明理廣；今開言廣，即理廣也。

> **Opening coarse to reveal subtle**: Previously twelve, eleven, or nine divisions didn't express the real; now there is no separate real different from the previous non-real. Previously only saying "extensive" without clarifying principle-extensive; **now opening word-extensive to be principle-extensive**.

開昔之異，顯今之同，即是絕待明說法妙也。

> **Opening the past differences to reveal the present sameness**—this is the Absolute [perspective on] Dharma-Exposition Subtlety.

### Footnotes (Part 3 of Fascicle 6)

[^f6p3-1]: The **Twelve Divisions** (十二部經) represent the complete classification of Buddhist scripture by literary form and content. Master Zhiyi shows how each division in the *Lotus Sūtra* directly expresses Middle-Way Buddha-wisdom, unlike other sūtras which expound provisional teachings.

## Part 4: Retinue Subtlety (眷屬妙) — Five Types of Assembly

### The Ninth [Subtlety]: Retinue Subtlety

#### Why Retinue After Dharma-Exposition

若無說而已，說必被緣，緣即受道人也。已受道故，即成眷屬。

> If there were no teaching, that would be one thing. **If there is teaching, it must reach those with affinity**—those with affinity are Dharma-receivers. **Having received the Dharma, they become retinue**.

譬如父母遺體，攬此成身，得為天性。天性親愛，故名眷；更相臣順，故名屬。

> Like parents' legacy-body—grasping this, one forms a body, becoming natural kinship. **Natural kinship's loving connection is called "kin" (眷); mutually serving and following is called "belonging" (屬)**.

#### How Retinue Forms

行者亦爾，受戒之時，說此戒法，授於前人，前人聽聞，即得發戒，師、弟所由生也。

> Practitioners are the same. At the time of receiving precepts, this precept-dharma is explained and transmitted to the person before [the teacher]; hearing it, [the student] develops precepts—**this is how teacher and disciple arise**.

禪亦如是，授安心法，如教修行，即得發定，是為我師，我是弟子。

> Dhyāna is also like this: transmitting the mind-settling method, cultivating as taught, one develops samādhi—**"this is my teacher; I am the disciple."**

慧亦如是，說諸法門，轉入人心，由法成親。親故則信，信故則順，是名眷屬也。

> Wisdom is also like this: explaining the dharma-gates, [they] turn and enter the person's mind—**through Dharma, kinship is established**. Kinship leads to faith; faith leads to following—this is called retinue.

#### Five Types of Retinue

二、明眷屬者，又為五種：

> Explaining retinue has **five types**:

| # | Type | Description |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Principle-nature** (理性眷屬) | Inherent Buddha-nature connection |
| 2 | **Karma-born** (業生眷屬) | Connection through shared karma |
| 3 | **Vow-born** (願生眷屬) | Connection through vows |
| 4 | **Supernatural-born** (神通生眷屬) | Connection through spiritual powers |
| 5 | **Response-born** (應生眷屬) | Connection through compassionate manifestation |

**1. Principle-Nature Retinue**

理性眷屬者，眾生如佛如，一如無二如，理性相關，任運是子。

> **Principle-nature retinue**: Sentient beings' suchness is Buddha's suchness; **one suchness, no second suchness**; principle-nature mutually connects—**naturally they are children**.

故云：「我亦如是，眾聖中尊，世間之父。一切眾生，皆是吾子。」

> Hence it says: "**I am also like this—honored among sages, father of the world. All sentient beings are my children.**"

此是理性，不關結緣、不結緣，皆是佛子也。

> This is principle-nature—**whether having established affinity or not, all are Buddha's children**.

**2. Karma-Born Retinue**

業生眷屬者，但眾生理論皆子，而飲他毒藥，有失心者、不失心者。

> **Karma-born retinue**: Though in principle all beings are children, they've drunk others' poison—**some have lost their minds, some haven't**.

不失心者，拜跪問訊，求索救護，與藥即服...

> Those who haven't lost their minds bow, inquire, seek protection—given medicine, they take it...

其失心者，雖與良藥而不肯服，流浪生死，逃逝他國。

> Those who have lost their minds—**though given good medicine, they won't take it**, wandering in birth-and-death, fleeing to other countries.

**3. Vow-Born Retinue**

願眷屬者，先世結緣，雖未斷苦，願生內眷屬中...

> **Vow-born retinue**: Past lives established affinity; though suffering not yet cut, **vowing to be born among inner retinue**...

**4. Supernatural-Born Retinue**

神通眷屬者，若先世值佛，發真見諦，生猶未盡，或在上界，或在他方...

> **Supernatural-born retinue**: If in past lives one met Buddha, developed true seeing of truth, but births not yet exhausted—whether in higher realms or other directions...

以通力分形來此...為親、中、怨，輔佛行化...

> Using supernatural power to divide one's form and come here... **being kin, neutral, or enemy—assisting Buddha's transformative teaching**...

**5. Response-Born Retinue**

法身惑除理顯，何故受生？應身受生，其意有三：一為熟他。二為自熟。三為本緣。

> Dharma-body—delusion removed, principle revealed—why take birth? **Response-body taking birth has three meanings**:
> 1. **For ripening others**
> 2. **For ripening oneself**
> 3. **For original affinities**

#### The Secret of the *Lotus Sūtra*'s Retinue

當知，諸眷屬非生死人。摩耶是千佛之母，淨飯是千佛之父，羅睺羅千佛之子。諸聲聞等，悉內祕外現，示眾有三毒，實自淨佛土...

> Know that **these retinue are not birth-and-death beings**. Māyā is mother of a thousand Buddhas; Śuddhodana is father of a thousand Buddhas; Rāhula is son of a thousand Buddhas. **All the śrāvakas secretly hide inside while manifesting outside**—showing they have the three poisons while **actually purifying Buddha-lands**...

諸親族等，皆是大權法身上地。豈有凡夫，能懷那羅延菩薩耶？

> All kinfolk are **great expedient Dharma-body higher-ground [bodhisattvas]**. Could an ordinary being carry the Nārāyaṇa bodhisattva [in the womb]?

**Even Enemies Are Dharma-Body Manifestations**

調達是賓伽羅菩薩，先世大善知識。阿闍世是不動菩薩。薩遮尼犍是大方便菩薩。波旬是住不思議解脫。

> **Devadatta is Siṃhavikrīḍita bodhisattva**—a great spiritual friend from past lives. **Ajātaśatru is Akṣobhya bodhisattva**. **Saccanigaṇṭha is Great Skillful Means bodhisattva**. **Māra is one dwelling in Inconceivable Liberation**.

故《華嚴》列眾，明諸天、龍、鬼神悉住不可思議法門。

> Hence the *Avataṃsaka*'s assembly lists make clear that all gods, dragons, ghosts, and spirits **dwell in inconceivable dharma-gates**.

#### Coarse and Subtle Retinue

若三藏根性眷屬，此性下劣...皆麁眷屬也。

> If Tripiṭaka root-nature retinue—this nature is inferior... all are **coarse retinue**.

今《法華》定天性審父子，非復客作，故常不輕深得此意，知一切眾生正因不滅，不敢輕慢。

> Now the *Lotus* **definitively establishes natural kinship, examining father and children**—no longer guest-laborers. Hence **Never-Disparaging** deeply grasped this meaning: knowing all sentient beings' right-cause is indestructible, **he dared not slight them**.

### Footnotes (Part 4 of Fascicle 6)

[^f6p4-1]: The **Five Types of Retinue** reveal the full scope of spiritual connection. Most remarkable is the teaching that even enemies and persecutors may be Dharma-body manifestations helping beings through "reverse methods."

## Part 5: Benefits Subtlety (功德利益妙) — Seven Benefits, Ten Applications

### The Tenth [Subtlety]: Benefits Subtlety

#### Why Benefits After Retinue

諸佛所為，未甞空過。

> **What Buddhas do never passes emptily.**

《釋論》云：「佛入王三昧，前放光度前者，後放光度後者。」譬如網魚，前獲、後獲，見光聞法，皆不唐捐。

> The *Śāstra* says: "Buddha enters the King Samādhi—**light released before liberates the former; light released after liberates the latter**." Like netting fish—catching before and after—seeing light and hearing Dharma, **none is wasted**.

#### Function and Benefit Distinguished

秖功德利益，一而無異；若分別者，自益名功德，益他名利益。

> **Merit and benefit are one without difference.** If distinguishing: **self-benefit is called merit; benefiting others is called benefit**.

#### The Seven Benefits

一、二十五有果報益，亦名地上清涼益。

> 1. **Twenty-five existences fruit-reward benefit**, also called **clear-cool benefit on the ground**

二、二十五有因華開敷益，亦名小草益。

> 2. **Twenty-five existences cause-flower-opening benefit**, also called **small herbs benefit**

三、真諦三昧析法益，亦名中草益。

> 3. **True-truth samādhi analytical-dharma benefit**, also called **middle herbs benefit**

四、俗諦三昧五通益，亦名上草益。

> 4. **Conventional-truth samādhi five-powers benefit**, also called **upper herbs benefit**

五、真諦三昧體法益，亦名小樹益。

> 5. **True-truth samādhi body-dharma benefit**, also called **small trees benefit**

六、俗諦三昧六通益，亦名大樹益。

> 6. **Conventional-truth samādhi six-powers benefit**, also called **great trees benefit**

七、中道王三昧益，亦名最實事益。

> 7. **Middle-Way King Samādhi benefit**, also called **most-real-matter benefit**

**Correspondence with Retinue Types**

若二十五有因果益，堪為業生眷屬。若真諦三昧體析益，堪為願生眷屬。若俗諦三昧五通六通益，堪為神通眷屬。若中道王三昧益，堪為應生眷屬。

> - **Twenty-five existences cause-and-effect benefit** → fit for **karma-born retinue**
> - **True-truth samādhi body-analytical benefit** → fit for **vow-born retinue**
> - **Conventional-truth samādhi five/six powers benefit** → fit for **supernatural-born retinue**
> - **Middle-Way King Samādhi benefit** → fit for **response-born retinue**

#### Ten Applications of Benefits

更廣開為十益：一、果益。二、因益。三、聲聞益。四、緣覺益。五、六度益。六、通益。七、別益。八、圓益。九、變易益。十、實報益。

> Further broadly opened into **ten benefits**:

| # | Benefit | Description |
|---|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Fruit** | Liberation from twenty-five existences' suffering |
| 2 | **Cause** | Building good karma toward liberation |
| 3 | **Śrāvaka** | Arhatship through analytical emptiness |
| 4 | **Pratyekabuddha** | Pratyekabuddha awakening |
| 5 | **Six Pāramitās** | Subduing afflictions through perfections |
| 6 | **Common** | Shared vehicle liberation |
| 7 | **Distinct** | Separate bodhisattva path |
| 8 | **Perfect** | Complete one-vehicle awakening |
| 9 | **Transformation-realm** | Expedient-remainder land benefits |
| 10 | **Real-reward** | Buddha-land benefits |

**Fruit Benefit: Clear-Cool in Twenty-Five Existences**

果益者，即二十五有果報益也。有八大地獄...

> **Fruit benefit is twenty-five existences fruit-reward benefit.** There are eight great hells...

地獄有，有善惡之機，關無垢三昧慈悲之應。

> **Hell existence has good-and-evil machines that hinge upon the Undefiled Samādhi's compassion-response.**

其中罪人，宿世善根，可發關宜。而為聖人赴對應之，或蒙光照、或注雨滅火、或調達婆藪開示說法，熱悶甦醒，身體清涼，獲冥、顯兩益，諸苦得息。

> Sinners there have **past-world good roots that can be triggered**. Sages go to respond to them—whether through light illuminating, rain extinguishing fire, or Devadatta/Vasiṣṭha explaining Dharma—**hot anguish revives, bodies become cool**, obtaining hidden and manifest benefits, all suffering ceasing.

**Middle-Way King Samādhi Benefit**

圓人益者，此是修三諦一實之理。一念法界，繫緣法界。若歷緣對境，舉足下足無非道場...

> **Perfect-person benefit**: This is **cultivating three-truths one-reality principle**. One-thought Dharma-realm, connecting with Dharma-realm. Whether passing through conditions or facing objects, **raising or lowering the foot—none is not the practice-site**...

可發關宜，聖人赴對應之，豁然開悟。或似或真，得冥顯兩益。此是圓用二十五三昧圓加破二十五有，顯出我性，得究竟實事之益也。

> Triggerable and suitable—sages go and respond—**suddenly awakening**. Whether seeming or true, obtaining hidden-and-manifest benefits. This is **perfect use of twenty-five samādhis perfectly added to break twenty-five existences**, revealing self-nature, obtaining **ultimate real-matter benefit**.

#### Opening Coarse to Reveal Subtle

若麁、妙機，若別、圓應，若淨、穢土，若淺、深益，不出十番，包括法界，利益略周，大意可見...

> Whether **coarse or subtle machines**, whether **Distinct or Perfect responses**, whether **pure or defiled lands**, whether **shallow or deep benefits**—none exceeds these ten applications. They **encompass the Dharma-realm, benefits roughly complete**, the great meaning visible...

#### Summary

此五番明妙，從因至果，以辨自行妙，半如意珠竟。

> **These five [latter] sections clarify subtlety**—from cause to fruit, distinguishing self-practice subtlety. **Half the wish-fulfilling jewel is complete**.

### Footnotes (Part 5 of Fascicle 6)

[^f6p5-1]: The **Ten Trace Subtleties** divide into two halves: the first five (Realm, Wisdom, Practice, Position, Three Dharmas) address "self-benefit" (功德); the latter five (Resonance, Supernatural Powers, Dharma-exposition, Retinue, Benefits) address "other-benefit" (利益). Together they complete the wish-fulfilling jewel's function.

# Fascicle 7

## Part 1: Fundamental and Trace (本迹) — The Second Half of the Jewel

### Part Two: Ten Subtleties Explained According to the Fundamental

#### Introduction: The Two Halves

The Ten Trace Subtleties (迹門十妙) represented the **first half** of the wish-fulfilling jewel—the Buddha's manifest teaching.

Now we turn to the Ten Fundamental Subtleties (本門十妙)—**the second half**—addressing the Buddha's eternal nature revealed in Chapter 16, "Lifespan of the Tathāgata."

#### Six Meanings of Fundamental and Trace

釋本迹為六：

> Explaining Fundamental and Trace has **six meanings**:

**1. Principle as Fundamental (理本)**

本者理本，即是實相一究竟道；迹者，除諸法實相，其餘種種皆名為迹。

> **Fundamental means Principle-Fundamental**—this is reality-mark, the One Ultimate Path. **Trace means**: except for reality-mark of all dharmas, everything else is called trace.

**2. Principle-and-Event as Fundamental (理事本)**

又理之與事，皆名為本；說理說事，皆名教迹也。

> Moreover, **both principle and event are called Fundamental**; **explaining principle and explaining event are called Teaching-Trace**.

**3. Teaching as Fundamental (教本)**

又理事之教，皆名為本；稟教修行，名為迹，如人依處，則有行跡，尋跡得處也。

> Moreover, **teaching of principle-and-event is Fundamental**; **receiving teaching and practicing is Trace**—like a person depending on a place leaves footprints; following tracks, one finds the place.

**4. Body as Fundamental (體本)**

又行能證體，體為本；依體起用，用為迹。

> Moreover, **practice can realize the Body; Body is Fundamental**. **Depending on Body to activate Function; Function is Trace.**

**5. Real-Attainment as Fundamental (實得本)**

又實得體用，名為本；權施體用，名為迹。

> Moreover, **actually attaining Body-and-Function is Fundamental**; **provisionally bestowing Body-and-Function is Trace**.

**6. Today-and-Already as Fundamental (今已本)**

又今日所顯者為本；先來已說者為迹。

> Moreover, **what is revealed today is Fundamental**; **what was already spoken before is Trace**.

約此六義，以明本迹也。

> According to these six meanings, we clarify Fundamental and Trace.

**Summary Table: Six Meanings**

| # | Fundamental | Trace |
|---|-------------|-------|
| 1 | Reality-mark principle | Everything else |
| 2 | Principle and event | Teaching about them |
| 3 | Teaching | Practice based on teaching |
| 4 | Body/Substance | Function/Use |
| 5 | Real attainment | Provisional bestowal |
| 6 | What's revealed now | What was said before |

#### The Ten Fundamental Subtleties

△二、明本十妙者：

| # | Fundamental Subtlety | Chinese |
|---|---------------------|---------|
| 1 | Fundamental Cause | 本因妙 |
| 2 | Fundamental Fruit | 本果妙 |
| 3 | Fundamental Land | 本國土妙 |
| 4 | Fundamental Resonance | 本感應妙 |
| 5 | Fundamental Supernatural Powers | 本神通妙 |
| 6 | Fundamental Dharma-Exposition | 本說法妙 |
| 7 | Fundamental Retinue | 本眷屬妙 |
| 8 | Fundamental Nirvāṇa | 本涅槃妙 |
| 9 | Fundamental Lifespan | 本壽命妙 |
| 10 | Fundamental Benefits | 本利益妙 |

#### Brief Explanation

**1. Fundamental Cause Subtlety (本因妙)**

本因妙者，本初發菩提心，行菩薩道所修因也。

> **Fundamental Cause Subtlety**: The original initial arising of bodhicitta, the cause cultivated through practicing the bodhisattva path.

若十六王子在大通佛時弘經結緣，皆是中間所作，非本因也。

> If the sixteen princes at Great-Penetration Buddha's time propagated the sūtra and established connections—**all this is intermediate activity, not Fundamental Cause**.

文云：「我以佛眼觀彼久遠，猶若今也。」唯佛能知如此久遠，皆是迹因，非本因也。

> The text says: "**With Buddha-eye I observe that distant past as if it were today.**" Only Buddha can know such remoteness—all these are **Trace Causes, not Fundamental Cause**.

若留中間之因，於後難信，是故《法華》拂迹除疑...過是已前所行道者，名之為本，即是本因妙也。

> If we retained the intermediate causes, later [practitioners] would find it hard to believe. Hence the *Lotus* **brushes away traces to remove doubt**... Before all that, what was practiced—this is called Fundamental, which is **Fundamental Cause Subtlety**.

**2. Fundamental Fruit Subtlety (本果妙)**

本初所行圓妙之因，契得究竟常、樂、我、淨，乃是本果。

> The originally first practiced perfect-subtle cause, **contracting ultimate Permanence, Bliss, Self, and Purity**—this is **Fundamental Fruit**.

不取寂滅道場，舍那成佛，為本果也。

> We **do not take the bodhi-tree site where Vairocana became Buddha as Fundamental Fruit**.

但取成佛已來，甚大久遠，初證之果，名本果妙也。

> We only take **"since becoming Buddha, immeasurably long ago"—the originally attained fruit**—as **Fundamental Fruit Subtlety**.

**3. Fundamental Land Subtlety (本國土妙)**

本既成果，必有依國...文云：「自從是來，我常在此娑婆世界說法教化。」

> Having achieved Fundamental Fruit, there must be a land to dwell in... The text says: "**Since then, I have always been in this Sahā world expounding Dharma and teaching.**"

按此文者，實非今日迹中娑婆，亦非中間權迹處所，乃是本之娑婆，即本土妙也。

> According to this text, it's really **not today's Trace-Sahā, nor the intermediate expedient-trace location**—it is **Fundamental Sahā**, which is **Fundamental Land Subtlety**.

**4. Fundamental Resonance Subtlety (本感應妙)**

既已成果，即有本時所證二十五三昧，慈悲誓願，機感相關，能即寂而照，故言本感應也。

> Having achieved Fruit, there are **the twenty-five samādhis realized at that original time**, compassion and vows, machine and response mutually connected, **able to be quiescent yet illuminating**—hence Fundamental Resonance.

**5-10. Remaining Fundamental Subtleties**

| Subtlety | Content |
|----------|---------|
| **Supernatural Powers** | Original powers with neutral transformation-upon-transformation dhyāna |
| **Dharma-Exposition** | Original turning of the Dharma-wheel |
| **Retinue** | Original disciples—"those from below are my children" |
| **Nirvāṇa** | Original extinction/non-extinction |
| **Lifespan** | Original limitless lifespan |
| **Benefits** | Original benefiting with karma-, vow-, power-, response-born |

#### Fundamental and Trace Though Different, Are Inconceivably One

This refrain appears throughout Fascicle 7:

> "**Fundamental and Trace, though different, are inconceivably one.**"

The point is not to reject the Trace but to understand that:
1. The Trace arises from the Fundamental
2. By following the Trace, we reach the Fundamental
3. Ultimately they are non-dual

### Footnotes (Part 1 of Fascicle 7)

[^f7p1-1]: The **Ten Fundamental Subtleties** parallel the Ten Trace Subtleties but address the Buddha's eternal reality rather than his manifest teaching. The key structural shift: Trace Subtleties 1-5 (境智行位三法) deal with cause; here **Cause** is condensed into one subtlety, while **Nirvāṇa** and **Lifespan** are added as separate subtleties.


## Part 2: The Lotus Flower Simile (蓮華) — Comprehensive Metaphor

### Explaining "Lotus Flower"

#### Four Topics

為四意：一、定法譬。二、引舊釋。三、出經論。四、正解釋。

> This has **four topics**:
> 1. Determining dharma and metaphor
> 2. Citing old explanations
> 3. Producing sūtra-and-śāstra [evidence]
> 4. Proper explanation

#### Part 1: Is "Lotus Flower" Dharma or Metaphor?

定法譬者，權實難顯，借喻蓮華，譬於妙法。

> Determining dharma and metaphor: **Expedient and real are difficult to reveal**, so we borrow the simile of the lotus to metaphorize the subtle dharma.

又七喻文多，故以譬標題。

> Also, because the seven parables [in the sūtra] have extensive text, **we use metaphor to mark the title**.

**The Alternative View: Lotus as Dharma Itself**

又解云：蓮華非譬，當體得名。

> Another explanation says: **The lotus is not a metaphor—it gets its name from [being] the thing itself.**

類如劫初，萬物無名，聖人觀理，準則作名：如蛛羅引絲，倣之結網；蓬飛獨運，依而造車...

> Like at the beginning of the kalpa when myriad things had no names, sages observed principle and made names accordingly: Like a spider drawing silk, one imitated it to make nets; like tumbleweeds flying independently, one relied on them to make carts...

今蓮華之稱，非是假喻，乃是法華法門；法華法門清淨，因果微妙，名此法門為蓮華，即是法華三昧當體之名，非譬喻也。

> Now the name "lotus" **is not a borrowed metaphor—it is the Lotus Dharma-Gate**. The Lotus Dharma-Gate is pure, cause and fruit are subtle—**this dharma-gate is named "Lotus"**—it is the essential name of the Lotus Samādhi, not a simile.

**Master Zhiyi's Synthesis**

今融二意。

> Now I **fuse both meanings**.

利根即名解理，不假譬喻，但作法華之解。中、下未悟，須譬乃知，以易解之蓮華，喻難解之蓮華。

> **Sharp-rooted** people understand principle from the name directly, not needing metaphor—they simply make the Lotus interpretation. **Middle and lower** [roots] haven't awakened yet—they need metaphor to know. Use the **easily understood lotus** to metaphorize the **hard-to-understand Lotus**.

約上根是法名，約中、下是譬名；三根合論，雙標法譬。

> For upper roots it's a **dharma-name**; for middle and lower roots it's a **metaphor-name**. Combining three roots, we **double-mark it as both dharma and metaphor**.

#### Part 2: Classical Names

叡師序云：「未敷名屈摩羅，將落名迦摩羅，處中盛時名分陀利。」

> Master Rui's preface says: "**Before opening, it's called kumuda; about to fall, it's called kamala; at its full prime, it's called puṇḍarīka.**"

遠師云：分陀利伽是蓮華開喻，然體逐時，遷名隨色變，故有三名也。

> Master Yuan says: Puṇḍarīka is the open-lotus metaphor. But the body follows time, names change with color—hence three names.

#### Part 3: The *Treatise on the Lotus Sūtra*'s Seventeen Names

《法華論》列十七名：

> The *Treatise on the Lotus Sūtra* lists **seventeen names**:

| # | Name | Sanskrit/Chinese |
|---|------|------------------|
| 1 | Immeasurable Meaning | 無量義 |
| 2 | Most Victorious | 最勝 |
| 3 | Great Vaipulya | 大方等 |
| 4 | Teaching Bodhisattva Dharma | 教菩薩法 |
| 5 | Buddha-Protected | 佛所護念 |
| 6 | All Buddhas' Secret Treasury | 諸佛祕藏 |
| 7 | All Buddhas' Storehouse | 一切佛藏 |
| 8 | All Buddhas' Secret Script | 一切佛密字 |
| 9 | Giving Birth to All Buddhas | 生一切佛 |
| 10 | All Buddhas' Bodhi-Site | 一切佛道場 |
| 11 | All Buddhas' Turned Dharma-Wheel | 一切佛所轉法輪 |
| 12 | All Buddhas' Firm Relics | 一切佛堅固舍利 |
| 13 | All Buddhas' Great Skillful Means | 諸佛大巧方便 |
| 14 | Speaking One Vehicle | 說一乘 |
| 15 | Abiding in Ultimate Meaning | 第一義住 |
| 16 | **Subtle Dharma Lotus Flower** | **妙法蓮華** |
| 17 | Dharma-Gate Collecting Immeasurable Names | 法門攝無量名字 |

**The *Treatise*'s Two Meanings of Lotus**

今解論意，若言令眾生見淨妙法身者，此以妙因開發為蓮華也。若言入如來大眾坐蓮華上者，此以妙報國土為蓮華也。

> Understanding the Treatise's meaning: If it says "causing beings to see the pure subtle Dharma-body," **this takes subtle cause's opening-and-developing as lotus**. If it says "entering among the Tathāgata's great assembly, sitting on a lotus," **this takes the subtle reward-land as lotus**.

#### Part 4: Comprehensive Lotus Simile

**Three Metaphors for the Trace Gate**

一、華生必有於蓮，為蓮而華，蓮不可見，此譬約實明權、意在於實，無能知者。

> **First**: When a flower grows, there must be a lotus. The flower is for the lotus, [but] the lotus cannot be seen. This metaphorizes **basing expedient on real, intent on the real, unknowable by any**.

二、華開故蓮現，而須華養蓮，譬權中有實，而不能知。今開權顯實，意須於權，廣識恒沙佛法者，秖為成實，使深識佛知見耳。

> **Second**: Because the flower opens, the lotus appears—yet the flower must nourish the lotus. This metaphorizes **real within expedient, yet not cognizable**. Now opening expedient to reveal real—the intent is on expedient. Broadly knowing sand-grain Buddha-dharmas is simply to complete the real, causing deep knowledge of Buddha's knowledge-and-vision.

三、華落蓮成，即喻廢三顯一，唯一佛乘直至道場。

> **Third**: Flower falls, lotus forms—this metaphorizes **abandoning three to reveal one**—only One Buddha Vehicle going straight to the bodhi-site.

**Three Metaphors for the Fundamental Gate**

一、華必有蓮，譬迹必有本，迹含於本。意雖在本，佛旨難知，彌勒不識。

> **First**: A flower must have a lotus—this metaphorizes **Trace must have Fundamental**, Trace contains Fundamental. Though intent is on Fundamental, Buddha's purport is hard to know—Maitreya doesn't recognize it.

二、華開蓮現，譬開迹顯本，意在於迹。能令菩薩識佛方便，既識迹已，還識於本，增道損生。

> **Second**: Flower opens, lotus appears—this metaphorizes **opening Trace to reveal Fundamental**—intent is on Trace. Able to make bodhisattvas recognize Buddha's skillful means; having recognized Trace, they return to recognize Fundamental, increasing path and decreasing birth.

三、華落蓮成，譬廢迹顯本。既識本已不復迷迹，但於法身修道，圓滿上地也。

> **Third**: Flower falls, lotus forms—this metaphorizes **abandoning Trace to reveal Fundamental**. Having recognized Fundamental, one no longer confuses Trace; simply cultivating the path in Dharma-body, completing upper grounds perfectly.

**The Lotus Simile Applied to Ten Suchnesses**

蓮華譬十如境。

> **The lotus metaphorizes the Ten Suchnesses realm**:

| Suchness | Lotus Element |
|----------|---------------|
| **Such-Mark** | Lotus seed's black indestructible shell—pure mind |
| **Such-Nature** | White flesh inside—wisdom-nature |
| **Such-Body** | Four elements not decaying—Buddha-nature body |
| **Such-Power** | Curled heart with growth energy—bodhicitta power |
| **Such-Activity** | Complete with root, stem, flower, leaf—initial bodhicitta activity |
| **Such-Cause** | Growing from mud to air—true cause |
| **Such-Condition** | Stamen surrounding lotus inside flower—myriad practices |
| **Such-Fruit** | Flower forms lotus, petals fall, fruit ripens—great fruit |
| **Such-Reward** | Pod encasing seeds—habit-fruit |
| **Such-Ultimate** | Four elements in mud = four elements in air—original-end equality |

**The Lotus Simile Applied to All Ten Subtleties**

Master Zhiyi extends the lotus metaphor to each subtlety:

| Subtlety | Lotus Element |
|----------|---------------|
| **Wisdom** | Inner growth nature |
| **Practice** | Stem = compassion, leaf = wisdom, stamen = samādhi |
| **Position** | Sprouting, emerging from mud, in water, in air = various stages |
| **Three Dharmas** | Four elements = True Nature; hollow center = Contemplative Illumination |
| **Resonance** | Shadow in clear water = manifest response; shadow in murky water = hidden |
| **Supernatural Powers** | Swaying in wind = ground-shaking; closing at night = entering samādhi |
| **Dharma-Exposition** | Closed = hidden One Vehicle; open = revealed One Vehicle |
| **Retinue** | New lotus from root = karma-born; from seed = vow-born |
| **Benefits** | Fish and turtles below, bees above = fruit benefits; gathering leaves = cause |

#### Concluding Application

如是等譬及餘無量譬喻，以譬迹中十妙...本初修因證果已竟，為眾生故更起方便，在生死中，示初發心，復示究竟。

> **These metaphors and immeasurable others metaphorize the Trace's Ten Subtleties**... Originally cultivating cause and realizing fruit was already complete; for sentient beings' sake, [Buddha] further arises skillful means, in birth-and-death showing initial aspiration and again showing ultimate completion.

若非蓮華，何由遍喻上來諸法？法、譬雙辨，故稱妙法蓮華也。

> **If not for the lotus, by what means could we universally metaphorize all the above dharmas? Dharma and metaphor doubly distinguished—hence called "Subtle Dharma Lotus Flower."**

### Footnotes (Part 2 of Fascicle 7)

[^f7p2-1]: The **comprehensive lotus simile** is one of Master Zhiyi's masterpieces of hermeneutics. Every aspect of the lotus—from seed to decay—maps onto Buddhist doctrine. The lotus is both dharma itself (for sharp roots) and metaphor (for middle/lower roots).

# Fascicle 8

## Name and Substance (釋名, 辨體)

### Part One: The Generic Title — "Sūtra" (經)

**The Generic Title**

脩多羅，或云脩單蘭，或云脩妬路。

> **Sūtra** [Chinese: 經] has varying transliterations: xiūduōluó, xiūdānlán, or xiūdùlù—due to regional dialect differences.

**The Debate: Translatable or Not?**

釋此為五：一、明無翻。二、明有翻。三、和融有無。四、歷法明經。五、觀心明經。

> Explaining this has **five sections**:
> 1. Why it cannot be translated
> 2. Why it can be translated
> 3. Harmonizing both views
> 4. Explaining "sūtra" through dharmas
> 5. Explaining "sūtra" through mind-contemplation

**Part 1: Five Meanings That Cannot Be Translated (無翻五義)**

言無翻者，彼語多含，此語單淺，不可以單翻複。

> The argument for **no translation**: That language has multiple meanings; this language is single and shallow—**cannot use single to translate multiple**.

舊云：經含五義：

> The old teaching says: **"Sūtra" has five meanings**:

| # | Meaning | Chinese | Explanation |
|---|---------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Dharma-Source** | 法本 | Source of all teaching, practice, and principle |
| 2 | **Subtle Development** | 微發 | Gradual arising and deepening |
| 3 | **Gushing Spring** | 涌泉 | Inexhaustible flow |
| 4 | **Plumb-line** | 繩墨 | Standard that cuts wrong |
| 5 | **Flower Garland** | 結鬘 | Threading together without scattering |

**1. Dharma-Source (法本)**

所言教本者，金口所說一言為本，流出無量言教。

> **Teaching-source**: "What the golden mouth speaks with one word as source **flows out as immeasurable verbal teachings**."

經是行本者，示人無諍法，導達通塞。

> **Practice-source**: Shows people the non-contention dharma, guides through obstructions.

經是義本者，尋一句詮於一義，尋無量句詮無量義。

> **Principle-source**: Following one sentence expresses one meaning; following immeasurable sentences expresses immeasurable meanings.

**2. Subtle Development (微發)**

初聞世界悉檀，次第領受，分別法相，微有解生，漸漸增長。

> "Initially hearing worldly siddhānta, sequentially receiving and differentiating dharma-marks, **subtle understanding arises, gradually increasing**."

**3. Gushing Spring (涌泉)**

佛以四悉檀說法，文義無盡，法流不絕。

> "Buddha using four siddhāntas to teach—**text and meaning are inexhaustible, dharma-flow is unceasing**."

**4. Plumb-Line (繩墨)**

裁愛見之邪教，不為邪風倒惑。

> "**Cutting the deviant teachings of craving and views**, not overturned by deviant winds."

**5. Flower Garland (結鬘)**

結教行理，如結華鬘，令不零落。

> "**Threading together teaching, practice, and principle—like stringing a flower garland**, not allowing them to scatter."

**Part 2: Five Meanings That Can Be Translated (有翻五義)**

| # | Translation | Meaning |
|---|-------------|---------|
| 1 | **Sūtra** (經) | "Passage through"—all passes through the sage's mind |
| 2 | **Contract** (契) | Fits beings, fits events, fits principle |
| 3 | **Dharma-Source** (法本) | As above |
| 4 | **Thread** (線) | Sews teaching, practice, principle together |
| 5 | **Good Teaching** (善語教) | Teaching of good words, actions, principles |

**Part 3: Harmonizing Both (和融有無)**

今和融有無，虛豁義趣。

> "Now **harmonizing translatable and untranslatable**, opening up the meaning."

若等是無翻，何不標微發、涌泉等？今正用經，於多含義強。

> "If equally untranslatable, why not mark it as 'subtle development' or 'gushing spring'? **Now correctly using 'sūtra' because it is strongest among multiple meanings.**"

含三法本、三微發、三涌泉、諸繩墨、結鬘等義，亦含契、線、善語教、訓法、訓常等，無不攝在經一字中。

> "[Sūtra] **contains three dharma-sources, three subtle developments, three gushing springs, all plumb-lines, flower garlands... all absorbed in the single character 經**."

**Summary: Fifteen Meanings of "Sūtra"**

Master Zhiyi expands the traditional five to **fifteen**:

| Original | × 3 Aspects | = |
|----------|-------------|---|
| 5 Untranslatable | Teaching, Practice, Principle | 15 |
| 5 Translatable | Also 3 aspects each | 15 |

> "The old teaching says sūtra contains five meanings; **now I say sūtra contains fifteen meanings**."[^f8-1]

### Part Two: Substance — Reality-Mark (體)

**Discerning the Substance**

體者，一部之指歸，眾義之都會也。

> "**Substance** is the pointing-return of the whole text, the assembly of all meanings."

文云：「是法不可示，言辭相寂滅。」

> The text says: "**This dharma cannot be shown; the mark of verbal expression is quiescent**."

**Seven Topics on Substance**

即為七：一、正顯經體。二、廣簡偽。三、一法異名。四、入體之門。五、遍為眾經體。六、遍為諸行體。七、遍一切法體。

> This has **seven topics**:
> 1. Directly revealing the sūtra's substance
> 2. Broadly distinguishing false from true
> 3. One dharma, different names
> 4. Gates of entry to substance
> 5. Pervading as substance of all sūtras
> 6. Pervading as substance of all practices
> 7. Pervading as substance of all dharmas

**Rejecting Previous Interpretations**

北地師用一乘為體...今不用此解。

> "Northern masters use 'One Vehicle' as substance... **I don't use this interpretation**."

又有解言：真諦為體。此亦通濫...故不用。

> "Others say 'True-truth' is substance. This is also too general... **so I don't use it**."

又有解言：一乘因果為體。今亦不用。

> "Others say 'One-Vehicle cause-and-fruit' is substance. **I also don't use this**."

**The Correct Substance: Reality-Mark (實相)**

三正顯體者，即一實相印也。

> "**Directly revealing substance: it is the One Reality-Mark Seal.**"

三軌之中，取真性軌。十法界中，取佛法界。佛界十如是中，取如是體。

> "Among Three Tracks, take True Nature Track. Among Ten Dharma-Realms, take Buddha Dharma-Realm. Among Buddha-realm's Ten Suchnesses, **take Such-Body**."

**Proof Texts**

〈序品〉云：「今佛放光明，助顯實相義。」

> *Introduction Chapter*: "Now Buddha emits light, **helping to reveal Reality-Mark meaning**."

〈方便品〉云：「唯佛與佛，乃能究盡諸法實相。」

> *Skillful Means Chapter*: "**Only Buddha with Buddha can fully fathom the Reality-Mark of all dharmas**."

〈法師品〉云：「開方便門，示真實相。」

> *Dharma-Teacher Chapter*: "**Opening the expedient gate, showing true Reality-Mark**."

**The Three Similes for True and False**

**1. Three Beasts Crossing the River**

三獸渡河，同入於水...兔、馬力弱，雖濟彼岸，浮淺不深...大象力強，俱得底岸。

> "Three beasts cross the river, entering the same water... Rabbit and horse are weak—though reaching the other shore, they float shallow, not deep... **The great elephant is strong—reaching both bottom and shore**."

水喻即空，底喻不空...菩薩獨到。

> "Water metaphorizes emptiness; bottom metaphorizes non-emptiness... **Only the bodhisattva reaches [the bottom]**."

**2. Crystal vs. Wish-Fulfilling Jewel**

頗梨、如意，兩珠相似...頗梨但空，不能雨寶。如意珠，亦空亦雨寶。

> "Crystal and wish-fulfilling jewel resemble each other... Crystal is merely empty, cannot rain treasures. **Wish-fulfilling jewel is both empty and rains treasures**."

**3. Gold in Stone**

譬如黃石中金，愚夫無識，視之謂石...估客得之，融出其金...金匠得之，造作種種...仙客得之，練為金丹，飛天入地。

> "Like gold in yellow stone: Fools don't recognize it, call it stone... Merchants get it, melt out the gold... Goldsmiths get it, make various ornaments... **Alchemists get it, refine it into elixir, fly to heaven, enter earth**."

金丹實相，以為經體也。

> "**Gold-elixir Reality-Mark is the sūtra's substance**."

### Footnotes (Fascicle 8)

[^f8-1]: The **fifteen meanings of sūtra** represent Master Zhiyi's characteristic expansion of traditional categories. By applying the teaching/practice/principle triad to each of the five meanings (both translatable and untranslatable sets), he shows the inexhaustible depth of even a single title-character.

# Fascicle 9

## Essence (宗) and Function (用)

### Part One: Essence/Aim (宗) — The Third of Five Chapters

宗者，修行之喉衿，顯體之要蹊，如梁柱持屋，結網綱維。

> "**Essence** is the **throat** of practice, the **key pathway** to revealing Substance. Like **pillars holding a house**, like the **main cord of a net**."

提維則目動，梁安則桷存。

> "**Lift the cord, and the mesh moves; set the beam, and the rafters stand.**"

**Five Topics on Essence**

釋宗為五：一、簡宗體。二、正明宗。三、眾經同異。四、明麁妙。五、結因果。

> Explaining Essence has **five topics**:
> 1. Distinguishing Essence from Substance
> 2. Directly clarifying Essence
> 3. Sameness and difference with other sūtras
> 4. Coarse and subtle
> 5. Concluding with cause-and-fruit

**Distinguishing Essence from Substance**

有人言：宗即是體，體即是宗。今所不用。

> "Some say: 'Essence is Substance, Substance is Essence.' **I don't use this**."

宗致既是因果，因果即二體...體若不二，體即非宗。

> "**Essence's point is cause-and-fruit**; cause-and-fruit are two... If Substance is non-dual, Substance is not Essence."

不異而異，約非因非果而論因果，故有宗體之別耳。

> "**Not-different yet different**: According to non-cause-non-fruit, we discuss cause-and-fruit—hence the distinction between Essence and Substance."

**Rejecting Previous Interpretations**

| Interpreter | Interpretation | Why Rejected |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| Master Yuan | One Vehicle as Essence | Too broad—doesn't include beginning-to-end |
| Master Long | Fruit alone as Essence | Fruit doesn't stand alone; ignores cause |
| Others | Cause alone | Ignores the complete fruit |
| Others | Expedient-Real as Essence | Expedient is what this sūtra abandons |
| Others | Awakening as Essence | Awakening is only fruit, no cause |

**The Correct Essence: One-Vehicle Cause-and-Fruit**

二、正明宗者，此經始從〈序品〉訖〈安樂行品〉...為成弟子實因，因正果傍...從〈涌出品〉訖〈勸發品〉...而顯師之實果，果正因傍。

> "**Directly clarifying Essence**: This sūtra from *Introduction* to *Peaceful Practices* [Chapters 1-14]... **establishes disciples' real cause—cause is primary, fruit is secondary**... From *Emerging from Earth* to *Encouragement* [Chapters 15-28]... **reveals the Teacher's real fruit—fruit is primary, cause is secondary**."

合前因果共為經宗，意在於此。

> "**Combining both cause-and-fruit together makes the sūtra's Essence**—the meaning is in this."

**The Two Halves of the Sūtra**

| Half | Chapters | Content | Focus |
|------|----------|---------|-------|
| **Trace Gate** (迹門) | 1-14 | Opening expedient, revealing real | **Cause** primary |
| **Fundamental Gate** (本門) | 15-28 | Revealing original lifespan | **Fruit** primary |

所以經分二文，論本論迹...師弟權實，總在其間也。

> "Hence the sūtra divides into two texts, discussing Fundamental and Trace... Teacher-and-disciple, expedient-and-real—all are within this."[^f9-1]

### Part Two: Function/Power (用) — The Fourth of Five Chapters

**Discussing the Function**

用是如來之妙能，此經之勝用。

> "**Function** is the Tathāgata's **subtle ability**, this sūtra's **superior power**."

如來以權實二智為妙能，此經以斷疑生信為勝用。

> "The Tathāgata takes **expedient-and-real two wisdoms** as subtle ability. This sūtra takes **breaking doubt and generating faith** as superior power."

**Distinguishing Function from Essence**

宗亦有用，用亦有宗。宗用非用用，用用非宗用。

> "Essence also has function; Function also has essence. **Essence's function is not Function's function; Function's function is not Essence's function.**"

宗用者，因果是宗，因果各有斷伏為用...

> "Essence's function: Cause-and-fruit is essence; cause-and-fruit each have subduing as function..."

用有宗者，慈悲為用宗，斷疑生信為用用。

> "Function has essence: **Compassion** is Function's essence; **breaking doubt, generating faith** is Function's function."

**The Unique Function of This Sūtra**

諸經不純明佛智慧...不正破廢二乘果...如此力用，眾經所無，今經具之。

> "Other sūtras don't purely clarify Buddha's wisdom... don't directly break and abandon Two-Vehicle fruit... **Such power and function no other sūtra has; this sūtra has it completely**."

純顯佛之微妙智慧；不開眾生九法界知見，純開眾生佛之知見。

> "**Purely reveals Buddha's subtle wisdom**; doesn't open beings' nine-dharma-realm knowledge-and-vision—**purely opens beings' Buddha knowledge-and-vision**."

**Ten Uses of the Trace Gate**

| # | Use | Meaning |
|---|-----|---------|
| 1 | 破三顯一 | **Breaking three, revealing one** — Breaking attachment to three vehicles |
| 2 | 廢三顯一 | **Abandoning three, revealing one** — Abandoning expedient teaching |
| 3 | 開三顯一 | **Opening three, revealing one** — Opening three to show they are one |
| 4 | 會三顯一 | **Meeting three, revealing one** — Gathering all practices into one |
| 5 | 住一顯一 | **Abiding in one, revealing one** — Buddha's original intent |
| 6 | 住三顯一 | **Abiding in three, revealing one** — Using expedient skillfully |
| 7 | 住非三非一顯一 | **Abiding in neither-three-nor-one, revealing one** — Transcending categories |
| 8 | 覆三顯一 | **Covering three, revealing one** — Preserving expedient for later use |
| 9 | 住三用一 | **Abiding in three, using one** — Disciples abiding in expedient |
| 10 | 住一用三 | **Abiding in one, using three** — Original vow to teach three |

**Ten Uses of the Fundamental Gate**

| # | Use | Meaning |
|---|-----|---------|
| 1 | 破迹顯本 | **Breaking trace, revealing fundamental** |
| 2 | 廢迹顯本 | **Abandoning trace, revealing fundamental** |
| 3 | 開迹顯本 | **Opening trace, revealing fundamental** |
| 4 | 會迹顯本 | **Meeting trace, revealing fundamental** |
| 5 | 住本顯本 | **Abiding in fundamental, revealing fundamental** |
| 6 | 住迹顯本 | **Abiding in trace, revealing fundamental** |
| 7 | 住非迹非本顯本 | **Abiding in neither-trace-nor-fundamental, revealing fundamental** |
| 8 | 覆迹顯本 | **Covering trace, revealing fundamental** |
| 9 | 住迹用本 | **Abiding in trace, using fundamental** |
| 10 | 住本用迹 | **Abiding in fundamental, using trace** |

**Connection to Four Siddhāntas**

結成悉檀者，權實二智，十用不同，即是一音演說，隨類各解。

> "**Concluding with Siddhāntas**: Expedient-real two wisdoms, ten uses different—this is **one voice teaching, each type understanding according to its kind**."

| Siddhānta | Trace Uses | Fundamental Uses |
|-----------|------------|------------------|
| **World** (世界) | Abiding in 3+1, using 3 | Abiding in trace/fundamental |
| **Person** (為人) | Opening, meeting, abiding in 3 | Opening, meeting trace |
| **Cure** (對治) | Breaking, abandoning, covering | Breaking, abandoning trace |
| **Ultimate** (第一義) | Abiding in 1, neither-3-nor-1 | Abiding in fundamental, neither |

**The Unique Power of This Sūtra**

此經開權顯實，四悉檀大用最為雄猛。發迹顯本，四悉檀永異眾經。

> "This sūtra's **opening expedient, revealing real**—Four Siddhāntas' great function is **most heroic and fierce**. **Revealing trace, manifesting fundamental**—Four Siddhāntas **eternally different from all other sūtras**."

迹中力用，已出諸教；本中十用，諸經無一！

> "The Trace's power and function **already surpasses all teachings**; the Fundamental's ten uses—**no other sūtra has even one**, let alone ten!"[^f9-2]

### Footnotes (Fascicle 9)

[^f9-1]: The **Essence (宗)** chapter establishes that the *Lotus Sūtra*'s aim is **One-Vehicle cause-and-fruit**, divided into the Trace Gate (cause-primary) and Fundamental Gate (fruit-primary).

[^f9-2]: The **Function (用)** chapter identifies the sūtra's unique power as **breaking doubt and generating faith** (斷疑生信), accomplished through twenty applications—ten for each gate.

# Fascicle 10

## Teaching Classification (教相) — Five Periods and Eight Teachings

### The Fifth Chapter: Teaching Classification

**Classifying the Teaching**

若弘餘經，不明教相，於義無傷；若弘《法華》，不明教者，文義有闕。

> "If promoting other sūtras, **not clarifying teaching-classification causes no harm**; if promoting the *Lotus Sūtra*, **not clarifying teaching-classification leaves the text-and-meaning incomplete**."

**Why Teaching Classification Is Essential for the Lotus**

今經不爾，絓是法門網目，大小觀法，十力無畏，種種規矩，皆所不論，為前經已說故。

> "This sūtra isn't like that—**all dharma-gate catalogs, great-and-small contemplation methods, Ten Powers, Fearlessnesses, various regulations—none are discussed**, because prior sūtras already explained them."

但論如來布教之元始，中間取與漸頓適時，大事因緣，究竟終訖。

> "It **only discusses the Tathāgata's original beginning of teaching-deployment**, the middle period's giving-and-withdrawing with gradual-and-sudden matching the time, **the Great Cause-and-Condition, and the ultimate conclusion**."

#### The Three Great Structures

**1. Three Kinds of Teaching (教)**

| Category | Chinese | Meaning |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Sudden** | 頓 | Direct teaching without stages |
| **Gradual** | 漸 | Sequential teaching through stages |
| **Indeterminate** | 不定 | Neither fixed sudden nor gradual |

**2. Five Periods (五時)**

The Buddha's teaching career divided into five periods, metaphorized by the Five Flavors of dairy:

| Period | Chinese | Teaching | Flavor |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **華嚴** | *Avataṃsaka* — for high bodhisattvas | **Milk** (乳) |
| 2 | **阿含** | *Āgamas* — Tripiṭaka for Two Vehicles | **Curds** (酪) |
| 3 | **方等** | *Vaipulya* — scolding small, praising great | **Fresh Butter** (生蘇) |
| 4 | **般若** | *Prajñāpāramitā* — emptiness for all | **Clarified Butter** (熟蘇) |
| 5 | **法華涅槃** | *Lotus* and *Nirvāṇa* — ultimate | **Ghee** (醍醐) |[^f10-1]

#### Critique of Other Schools (出異解)

Master Zhiyi surveys **ten different teaching-classification systems** from the South and North, critiquing each:

**Zhiyi's Critique Summary**

每一家皆有所失：

| System | What It Gets | What It Loses |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **Five Periods** | Gets expedient | Loses single-path real |
| **Half-Full** | Gets real intent | Loses expedient intent |
| **Four Tenets** | Gets structure | Loses Five-Flavor expedience |
| **One Sound** | Gets real wisdom | Loses expedient wisdom |

#### The Correct Teaching Classification

**The Three Proofs (引三文證)**

Master Zhiyi establishes his system with **three textual proofs**:

| Proof | Text | Evidence |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1 | **Skillful Means Chapter** | Describes sudden first, then gradual |
| 2 | **Sūtra of Immeasurable Meanings** | Five periods in order |
| 3 | **Trust-and-Understanding Chapter** | Four Voice-Hearers' parable matches progression |

**Five Flavors and Half-Full Combined (五味半滿相成)**

若直論五味，猶同南師，但得方便；若直半滿，猶同北師，但得其實。今明五味不離半滿，半滿不離五味。

> "If discussing Five Flavors alone, it's like Southern masters—only gets expedient. If discussing Half-Full alone, it's like Northern masters—only gets real. **Now I clarify: Five Flavors don't depart from Half-Full; Half-Full doesn't depart from Five Flavors.**"

| Period | Flavor | Half/Full |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Huayan** | Milk | Full only (唯滿不半) |
| **Āgama** | Curds | Half only (唯半不滿) |
| **Vaipulya** | Fresh Butter | Half-Full opposed (半滿相對) |
| **Prajñā** | Clarified Butter | Carrying half, discussing full (帶半論滿) |
| **Lotus** | Ghee | Abandoning half, clarifying full (廢半明滿) |

#### Opening and Combining (開合)

**The Four Teaching System (四教)**

| Teaching | Chinese | Characteristic |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Tripiṭaka** | 藏教 | Analytical emptiness |
| **Shared** | 通教 | Embodied emptiness |
| **Distinct** | 別教 | Sequential Middle Way |
| **Perfect** | 圓教 | Immediate Middle Way |[^f10-2]

從一開一者，十方佛土中，唯有一乘法，眾生不解，全生如乳...

> "**Opening one from one**: In Buddha-lands of ten directions, there is only One-Vehicle Dharma. Beings don't understand—entirely raw like milk... [Then various levels of opening until perfect]"

#### The Master's Conclusion

師云：我以五章，略譚玄義，非能申文外之妙，特是粗述所懷。

> "**The Master said**: With these five chapters, I've briefly discussed the Profound Meaning. This cannot express the subtlety beyond the text—it's merely a rough statement of what I hold in mind."

常恨言不能暢意，況復記能盡言！

> "I constantly regret that **words cannot fully express meaning**—how much more can records exhaust words!"

若能尋七義，次通十妙，研別體七，餘五鉤瑣相承，宛宛如繡，引經印定，句句環合...

> "If one can **seek the seven meanings, penetrate the Ten Subtleties, research the seven distinguishing Substances, and the remaining five linked in succession**, it will be like embroidery, **citing sūtras to confirm, sentence by sentence interlocking**..."

圓通之道，於斯通矣！遍朗之朗，於茲明矣！

> "**The path of perfect penetration is opened here! Universal illumination is illuminated here!**"

### Footnotes (Fascicle 10)

[^f10-1]: The **Five Periods** (五時) represent Master Zhiyi's temporal classification of the Buddha's teaching career, integrating the *Nirvāṇa Sūtra*'s Five Flavors metaphor with historical teaching content.

[^f10-2]: The **Four Teachings** (四教) represent Zhiyi's doctrinal classification: Tripiṭaka (藏), Shared (通), Distinct (別), and Perfect (圓).

[^f10-3]: The synthesis of **Five Periods + Half-Full + Four Teachings** creates the complete Tiantai teaching-classification system that became standard in East Asian Buddhism.
