## Book Description (4,000 character limit)

**Short Description:**
> The definitive scholarly translation of Master Zhiyi's *Fahua Xuanyi* (Fascicles 1–10)—the foundational text of Tiantai Buddhism.

**Full Description:**

**"Only our Master Zhiyi fully possessed all these virtues."**
— Guanding, Preface (594 CE)

The *Fahua Xuanyi* (Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra) is one of the most important philosophical texts in East Asian Buddhism. Composed by the Great Master Zhiyi (538–597 CE), the founder of the Tiantai school, this massive work shaped the doctrinal foundations of Chinese, Japanese, and Korean Buddhism for over a millennium.

This volume presents a rigorous **Scholarly Translation of Fascicles 1 through 10**, covering the core hermeneutical systems that define the Tiantai tradition.

**Key Contents:**

*   **The Five Profound Meanings:** Zhiyi's signature method for interpreting Buddhist scripture (Name, Substance, Essence, Function, Teaching).
*   **The Ten Subtleties (Trace Gate):** A comprehensive analysis of the historical Buddha's teaching, covering the Ten Suchnesses, the Three Truths, and the Three Tracks.
*   **The Ten Subtleties (Fundamental Gate):** The revelation of the Eternal Buddha's Cause, Fruit, Land, and Benefits.
*   **The Four Siddhāntas:** The diagnostic methodology for applying Buddhist teachings to different capacities.
*   **The Six Identities:** The map of spiritual progress from ordinary being to full Buddhahood.

**Features of This Edition:**

*   **Full English Translation:** A precise rendering of the Classical Chinese text (*Taishō Tripiṭaka* Vol. 33, No. 1716).
*   **Scholarly Apparatus:** Extensive footnotes explaining Sanskrit terms, doctrinal categories, and historical context.
*   **Structural Fidelity:** Preserves Zhiyi's intricate "opening and folding" outline structure.
*   **Technical Glossary:** Consistent rendering of Tiantai terminology (e.g., "True Nature Track," "Contemplative Illumination," "Resource Accomplishment").

Designed for scholars, monastics, and advanced practitioners, this edition opens the treasury of the "Wonderful Dharma" to the English-speaking world with unprecedented clarity and depth.
