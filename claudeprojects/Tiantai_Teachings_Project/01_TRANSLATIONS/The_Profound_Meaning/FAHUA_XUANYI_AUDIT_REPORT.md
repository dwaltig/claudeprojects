## 1. Doctrinal Integrity Audit

I have reviewed the English translations against the standard Tiantai doctrinal framework (*Panjiao*).

### Structural Verification
*   **The Five Sections (Introduction/Title/Substance/Essence/Function)**:
    *   **Generic Title (Sūtra)**: Correctly identified in Fascicle 8 with the "15 Meanings" (5 untranslatable x 3 aspects).
    *   **Specific Title (Lotus)**: Correctly distributed across Fascicles 1–7 (The Ten Subtleties).
    *   **Substance**: Correctly defined as "Reality-Mark" (Fascicle 8).
    *   **Essence**: Correctly defined as "One-Vehicle Cause-and-Fruit" (Fascicle 9).
    *   **Function**: Correctly defined as "Breaking Doubt, Generating Faith" (Fascicle 9).
    *   **Teaching**: Correctly defined as "Five Periods and Eight Teachings" (Fascicle 10).

### Key Terminology Check
*   **"Subtle" (*Miào*)**: Consistently rendered. The distinction between "Comparative Subtlety" (Absolute Subtlety) and "Relative Subtlety" is preserved in the logic, even if the terms are simplified for readability.
*   **"Trace" (*Jī*) and "Fundamental" (*Běn*)**: Correctly distinguished in Fascicle 7. The interpretation of the "Fundamental" as the *eternal* aspect (Chapter 16) vs. the "Trace" as the *manifest* aspect (Chapter 1-14) is accurate.
*   **"Ten Subtleties"**: The sequence (Objects, Wisdom, Practice, Position, Three Dharmas, Resonance, Supernatural Powers, Exposition, Retinue, Benefits) is preserved.

## 2. "English Only" Compliance Audit

*   **Status**: **PASSED**
*   **Methodology**: Automated grep scan for CJK Unified Ideographs (`\u4e00-\u9fff`) across all generated fascicle files.
*   **Findings**:
    *   Fascicles 1–10: **0 Chinese characters found.**
    *   Tables: Cleaned of Chinese columns.
    *   Parenthetical Glosses: Cleaned (e.g., "True Nature Track" instead of "True Nature Track (真性軌)").

## 3. Stylistic & Tone Audit

*   **Voice**: The voice is consistently "Scholarly Architect"—precise, structured, and authoritative. It avoids the "Blues" vernacular (good, as this is the scholarly version) but maintains readability better than a raw literal translation.
*   **Similes**: Key Tiantai metaphors (The Elephant Crossing the River, The Wish-Fulfilling Jewel, The Gold in Stone, The Three Poisons as Three Tracks) are preserved and lucidly translated.

## 4. Final Verdict

**APPROVED.**

The manuscript "Unified Field of Consciousness" (Fahua Xuanyi Fascicles 1–10) is doctrinally sound and meets the user's "English Only" specification. It is ready for compilation or publication.
