○第四明位妙者，諦理既融，智圓無隔，導行成妙。三義已顯，體、宗、用足。更明位妙者，行之所階也。但位有權實，布在經論。若《成論》、《毘曇》判位，言不涉大。《地》、《攝》等論判位，別敘一途，義不兼括。方等諸經明位，《瓔珞》已判淺深。般若諸經明位，《仁王》盛談高下而未彰麁妙。今經位名不彰，而意兼小大，粗判權實，然梵文不盡度，本經必有。

> The fourth, clarifying Position Subtlety: principle-truth has fused, wisdom is complete without obstruction, guiding practice to become subtle. The three meanings are already manifest; substance, essence, and function are sufficient. To further clarify position subtlety is the stages that practice ascends. Positions have expedient and real, spread throughout the sutras and treatises. If the *Satyasiddhi* and *Abhidharma* determine positions, their words do not reach the Great. The *Daśabhūmika*, *Mahāyānasaṃgraha*, and other treatises determine positions, separately narrating one route, meanings not mutually encompassing. The vaipulya sutras clarify positions; the *Yingluo* already judges shallow and deep. The prajñā sutras clarify positions; the *Renwang* extensively discusses high and low yet has not revealed coarse and subtle. This sutra’s position names are not manifest, yet its intent encompasses small and great, roughly judging expedient and real; however the Sanskrit wording is not fully translated—this sutra must have it.

今〈藥草喻品〉但明六位。文云：「轉輪聖王、釋、梵諸王，是小藥草。知無漏法，能得涅槃…，獨處山林，…得緣覺證，是中藥草。求世尊處，我當作佛，行精進定，是上藥草。又諸佛子，專心佛道，常行慈悲，自知作佛，決定無疑，是名小樹。安住神通，轉不退輪，度無量億百千眾生…，是名大樹。」追取長行中「一地所生，一雨所潤」，及後文云：「今當為汝說最實事」以為第六位也。前三義是藏中位；小樹是通位；大樹是別位；最實事是圓位也。

> Now, the *Medicinal Herbs Parable* chapter only clarifies six positions. The text says: "Wheel-turning sage kings, Indra, Brahmā, and the various kings are small herbs. Knowing the outflow-free dharmas, able to attain nirvāṇa..., dwelling alone in mountain forests..., attaining pratyekabuddha realization are middle herbs. Seeking the World-Honored One’s place, ‘I will become Buddha,’ practicing energetic concentration are upper herbs. Also the Buddha’s children, single-minded in the Buddha path, constantly practicing compassion, knowing themselves to become Buddha, decisively without doubt, are called small trees. Abiding in supernatural powers, turning the non-retreating wheel, liberating immeasurable hundreds of thousands of sentient beings..., are called great trees." Tracing to the prose "from one ground they arise, by one rain they are moistened," and the later text: "Now I shall speak the most real matter for you"—this is taken as the sixth position. The first three meanings are positions within the Tripiṭaka; small trees are Common positions; great trees are Distinct positions; the most real matter is the Perfect position.

小草位者，人天乘也。輪王是人主位，釋梵是天主位，皆約報果明位。果義既有優劣，當知修因必有淺深。人位因者，即是秉持五戒，略為四品：下品為鐵輪王，王一天下。中品為銅輪王，王二天下。上品為銀輪王，王三天下。上上品為金輪王，王四天下。皆是散心持戒，兼以慈心勸他為福故，報為人主，飛行皇帝，四方歸德，神寶自然應也。

> Small herb positions are the human-heavenly vehicle. The wheel-turning king is the human ruler position; Indra and Brahmā are heavenly ruler positions; all determine positions according to retribution fruits. Since the fruit meanings have superior and inferior, you should know the cultivated causes necessarily have shallow and deep. The human position causes are the upholding of the five precepts, roughly in four grades: the lower grade is the iron-wheel king, ruling one continent. The middle grade is the bronze-wheel king, ruling two continents. The upper grade is the silver-wheel king, ruling three continents. The upper-upper grade is the gold-wheel king, ruling four continents. All are scattered-mind precept holding, together with compassionate mind urging others to merit; therefore their retribution is human rulership, a flying emperor, with the four directions returning to virtue, and divine treasures naturally responding.

天乘位者，修十善道，任運淳熟，通是天因，加修禪定，進升上界。三界天果，高下不同，修因必深淺異也。《正法念》云：六萬山遶須彌，須彌四埵有持鬘天。有十住處，各千由旬。北四、餘各二。南名白摩尼，能十拍手頃，受三歸依。不雜餘心者，生此天受樂。轉輪王十六倍不及一，諸樂具悉從山河流出。二、名峻崖，昔於河濟，造立橋船，度持戒人，兼濟餘人，不作眾惡，果報可知。西方：一、名果命。昔於饑世，守持淨戒，淨身口意，種殖果樹，行者食之，安樂充滿。二、名白功德，昔以華鬘散佛上及塔上。東方：一、名一切喜。昔以華供養持戒人供佛。自力致財買華，果報可知。二、名行道。昔見大火起，焚燒眾生，以水滅之。果報(云云)。北方四者：一、名愛欲。二、名愛境界。三、名意動。四、名遊戲林。初者、見他親友相破，和合諍訟，得生此天。次、昔說法會。次、昔以淨信心供養眾僧掃塔，淨信上田。次、昔持信心，施僧衣，施一果直為作衣價，愛樂隨喜。

> The heavenly vehicle positions: cultivating the ten wholesome paths, naturally maturing—this is universally the heavenly cause; adding cultivation of meditation, one advances and ascends to higher realms. The heavenly fruits of the three realms differ in height and low; the cultivated causes must differ in depth and shallowness. The *Saddharma-smṛty-upasthāna* says: sixty thousand mountains encircle Mount Sumeru; on Sumeru’s four terraces are the Garland-Holding gods. There are ten abodes, each a thousand yojanas. The north has four, the rest have two each. The south is named White Maṇi: within the time of ten claps of the hands, they receive the Three Refuges. Those whose minds are not mixed with other thoughts are born in this heaven and receive joy. The wheel-turning king is not even one-sixteenth; all the joyful implements flow from mountains and rivers. Second, named Steep Cliff: formerly at river crossings, they built bridges and boats, ferrying those who kept precepts and also ferrying others, not doing many evils; the retribution is knowable. West: first, named Fruit-Life; formerly in a famine age, they kept pure precepts, purified body, speech, and mind, planted fruit trees; practitioners ate them, filled with peace and joy. Second, named White Merit; formerly with flower garlands they scattered over Buddhas and over stupas. East: first, named All-Joy; formerly they offered flowers to those holding precepts to offer to the Buddha. By their own strength they obtained wealth to buy flowers; the retribution is knowable. Second, named Path-Practice; formerly they saw a great fire arise, burning sentient beings, and extinguished it with water. The retribution (and so on). The four in the north: first, named Love-Desire; second, named Love-Realms; third, named Mind-Moving; fourth, named Forest of Play. The first: seeing others’ relatives and friends break apart, reconciling disputes and quarrels, they are born in this heaven. The second: formerly at dharma assemblies. The third: formerly with pure faith they offered to the sangha to sweep stupas, pure faith in the upper field. The fourth: formerly with faith they gave monks’ robes, giving the price of one fruit as the cost to make the robe, loving and rejoicing.

次、迦留波陀天，此言象跡，亦有十處：一、名行蓮華，昔持戒熏心，受三自歸，稱南無佛。所有蜂聲，尚勝餘天，況復餘果報耶！次、名勝蜂歡喜，昔信心持戒，有慈悲利益眾生，華香伎樂，供養佛塔。三、名妙聲，昔施佛寶蓋。四、名香樂，昔信心持戒，香塗佛塔。五、名風行，昔信心持戒，施僧扇，得清涼。六、天香風悉來熏之，皆倍倍增。香風尚爾，況念香風，隨念皆得。六、名散華歡喜，昔見持戒人說戒時，施澡缾；或道路中，盛滿淨水，施人澡缾。七、名普觀，昔於持戒人，以善熏心，於破戒人病，不求恩惠，悲心施安，心不疲厭，供養病人。八、名常歡喜，昔見犯法者應死，以財贖命，令其得脫。九、名香藥，昔於持戒、信三寶大福田中，施末香、塗香，淨心供養。如法得財，施已隨喜。十、名均頭，昔見人得罪於王，鬘髮受戮，救令得脫。

> Next, the Kālukapāda heaven; this means Elephant Track. It also has ten places: first, named Walking-Lotus; formerly, holding precepts perfumed the mind, received the Three Refuges, and recited “Namo Buddha.” The sound of the bees already surpasses other heavens—how much more the other retributions! Second, named Supreme-Bee Joy; formerly with faithful mind holding precepts, with compassion benefiting sentient beings, with flowers, incense, music, offering Buddha stupas. Third, named Wondrous Sound; formerly they offered jeweled canopies to the Buddha. Fourth, named Fragrant Joy; formerly with faithful mind holding precepts, they anointed Buddha stupas with fragrance. Fifth, named Wind-Going; formerly with faithful mind holding precepts, they gave fans to the sangha and attained coolness. Sixth, heavenly fragrant winds all come and perfume it, all increasing manifold. If fragrant winds are thus, how much more when one thinks of fragrant winds—according to thought, all are obtained. Sixth, named Scattering-Flowers Joy; formerly they saw precept-holders reciting precepts and gave bathing bottles; or on roads, filled clean water and gave bathing bottles to people. Seventh, named Universal Contemplation; formerly, toward precept-holders, they used goodness to perfume the mind; toward precept-breakers when sick, they did not seek gratitude, with compassionate mind gave comfort, mind not weary or tired, offering to the sick. Eighth, named Constant Joy; formerly seeing lawbreakers who should die, they used wealth to ransom their lives, allowing them to be freed. Ninth, named Fragrant Medicine; formerly among precept-holders and believers in the Three Jewels, in the great field of merit, they gave powdered incense and paste incense, offering with purified mind. They obtained wealth by proper means, and after giving, rejoiced. Tenth, named Juntou; formerly seeing people who had offended the king and were to be executed with hair bound in a topknot, they rescued them and had them freed.

第三天，名常恣意，十住處：一、名歡喜峯，昔救護神樹，及夜叉所依樹，有樹即樂，失樹即苦。二、名優鉢羅色，昔淨信持戒，供養三寶，造優鉢羅華池故。三、名分陀利，昔造此華池。四、名彩地，昔信淨心，為僧染治袈裟，雜色染治法服故。五、名質多羅，此翻雜地。昔以種種食，施持戒、不犯戒等人故。六、名山頂，昔修造屋，遮風寒，令人受用故。七、名摩偷，此翻美地。昔持戒，悲心質直，不惱人。食施道行沙門、婆羅門，或一日、或多日、或不息故。八、名欲境，昔持戒，若邪見人病，施其所安故。九、名清涼，昔見臨終渴病人，以石蜜漿，或冷水施病人故。十、名常遊戲，昔為坐禪人作房舍圖畫，作死屍觀故。

> The third heaven is named Constant-At-Will, with ten abodes: first, named Joy Peak; formerly they protected spirit trees and trees on which yakṣas relied; having trees was joy, losing trees was suffering. Second, named Utpala Color; formerly with pure faith holding precepts, they offered to the Three Jewels and made a utpala lotus pool. Third, named Puṇḍarī; formerly they made this lotus pool. Fourth, named Variegated Ground; formerly with faithful pure mind, they dyed and mended monks’ robes, using variegated dyes to dye the dharma-robes. Fifth, named Citra, translated “mixed ground”; formerly with various foods, they gave to those holding precepts and not violating precepts. Sixth, named Mountain Top; formerly they built houses to block wind and cold so that people could use them. Seventh, named Mathu, translated “beautiful ground”; formerly holding precepts, with compassionate and straightforward mind, not troubling people. They gave food to mendicants and brahmins walking the path, for one day or many days, without ceasing. Eighth, named Desire-Realms; formerly holding precepts, if someone with wrong views was sick, they gave what brought them ease. Ninth, named Cool; formerly seeing those near death and thirsty, they gave stone-honey syrup or cold water to the sick. Tenth, named Constant Play; formerly they made rooms and paintings for those sitting in meditation, for contemplating corpses.

第四、名箜篌天，有十住處：一、名楗陀羅，昔以園林，甘蔗菴羅等果林施僧故。二、名應聲，昔為邪見人說一偈法，令其心淨信佛故。三、名喜樂，昔施人美飲，或清美水，或覆泉井，不令蟲蟻入，行人飲之，無苦惱故。四、名掬水，昔見病苦者臨終，咽喉忽忽出聲，施其漿水，財物贖彼命。五、名白身，昔塗飾治補佛塔、僧舍，亦教人治補故。六、名共遊戲，昔信心持戒，同法義和合共故。七、名樂遊戲，昔持戒化眾生，令心淨信，歡喜戒施故。八、名共遊，昔法會聽法，佐助經營，深心隨喜故。九、名化生，昔見饑饉者、沒溺者，而救護之。十、名正行，昔見亡破抄掠，救令得脫，示嶮處正道。

> The fourth, named Konghou heaven, has ten abodes: first, named Gandhāra; formerly they gave orchards—sugarcane, āmra, and other fruit groves—to the sangha. Second, named Responsive Sound; formerly they spoke one gāthā of dharma to a person of wrong views, making that person’s mind purified and faithful to the Buddha. Third, named Joy; formerly they gave people fine drinks, or pure clear water, or covered springs and wells so insects and ants would not enter; travelers drank and had no suffering or affliction. Fourth, named Scooping Water; formerly seeing the sick and suffering at death, with throat sounds suddenly emerging, they gave them drink; with wealth they ransomed their lives. Fifth, named White Body; formerly they painted, adorned, and repaired Buddha stupas and sangha dwellings, also teaching others to repair them. Sixth, named Playing Together; formerly with faithful mind holding precepts, they harmonized together in dharma and meaning. Seventh, named Joyful Play; formerly holding precepts and transforming sentient beings, making their minds purified and faithful, rejoicing in precept-giving. Eighth, named Playing Together; formerly at dharma assemblies listening to dharma, helping in administration, with deep mind rejoicing. Ninth, named Spontaneously Born; formerly seeing those in famine or drowning, they rescued and protected them. Tenth, named Right Practice; formerly seeing people robbed and plundered, they rescued them and showed the right path in dangerous places.

次、日行天，遶須彌山，住於宮殿。外道說為日曜及星宿，略說三十六億。昔持七戒，令得增上果。風輪所持，此日行等大天與二大天，謂提頭賴吒、毘沙門，遊四天下，遊戲空中，受五欲樂，如意自娛。日行遶須彌山，隨在何方，山有影現，人說為夜。風輪持北方星，輪轉不沒，外道見辰星不沒，謂其能持一切世間國土，不知風力所為也。

> Next, the Sun-Going heaven, circling Mount Sumeru, dwelling in palaces. Heterodox teachers say it is the sun’s radiance and the constellations, in brief speaking of thirty-six billion. Formerly they held seven precepts, attaining superior fruits. Supported by the wheel of wind, this Sun-Going and other great heavens, together with the two great heavens—Dhṛtarāṣṭra and Vaiśravaṇa—travel the four continents, play in the sky, receive the pleasures of the five desires, enjoying themselves at will. The sun goes around Sumeru; wherever it is, the mountain’s shadow appears, which people call night. The wind-wheel supports the northern stars; they rotate and do not sink. Heterodox teachers see the morning star not sinking and say it can support all worldly lands, not knowing it is the force of the wind.

不殺戒，生四天處。不殺、不盜，生三十三天。加不婬，生焰摩天。加不口四過，生兜率天。又加世間戒，復信奉佛七戒，生化樂、他化兩天。所持戒轉勝，天身福命轉勝。又隨心持戒，思心勝者，其福轉勝。

> By the precept of not killing, one is born in four heavenly places. By not killing and not stealing, one is born in the Trāyastriṃśa heaven. Add not engaging in sexual misconduct, one is born in the Yāma heaven. Add the four faults of the mouth, one is born in the Tuṣita heaven. Further add worldly precepts and again believe and uphold the Buddha’s seven precepts, one is born in the two heavens of Transformation and Transformation by Others. As the precepts upheld grow superior, the heavenly body and fortune grow superior. Again, as one upholds precepts according to mind, if the intention-mind is superior, the fortune turns superior.

三十三天者，一名住善法堂天。昔持七戒，堅固無嫌，施四果、病人、父母、入滅定人。慈、悲、喜、捨，與怖畏壽命，生善法堂天，作釋迦提婆，姓憍尸迦，名能天主。有九十九那由他天女為眷屬，心無嫉妬，善法堂廣五百由旬。

> The Trāyastriṃśa heaven: one is named the Heaven Dwelling in the Hall of Good Dharma. Formerly they held seven precepts, firm and without blame; gave to the four fruits, to the sick, to parents, to those entering cessation samādhi. With kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity, and with fearlessness and life, they are born in the Heaven of the Hall of Good Dharma, becoming Śakra Devānām Indra, surname Kauśika, named “Able Heavenly Lord.” He has ninety-nine nayutas of heavenly maidens as retinue; mind without jealousy. The Hall of Good Dharma is five hundred yojanas wide.

第三、名清淨天，焰摩天王名牟修樓陀，身長五由旬。百千帝釋和合所不及。

> Third, named Pure Heaven: the Yāma heaven-king is named Mouxilouduo, his body five yojanas long. Hundreds of thousands of Śakras together cannot match him.

第四、兜率陀，此云分別意宮。其王名刪鬪率陀。

> Fourth, Tuṣita, here translated “Palace of Discriminating Intent.” Its king is named Shandouluotuo.

第五、涅摩地，此云自在，亦名不憍樂。

> Fifth, Nirmānarati, here translated “Self-Mastery,” also named “Joy Without Pride.”

第六、名婆羅尼蜜，此云他化自在。色、無色不復書。小藥草竟。

> Sixth, named Paranirmita, here translated “Mastery of Others’ Transformations.” Form and formless are no longer written. The small herbs are finished.

中藥草位者，即二乘也。此就習果判位。舊云：「《成論》探明大乘，解菩薩義。」此則不然。論主自云：「今正自明三藏中實義。」實義者，空是。人師豈可誣論主耶？此即空門明二十七賢聖斷伏之位。《阿毘曇》有門明七賢、七聖斷伏之位。委在兩論。

> Middle herbs positions are the Two Vehicles. This judges positions by cultivated fruit. Formerly it was said: "*Satyasiddhi* probes and clarifies the Mahāyāna, explaining bodhisattva meaning." This is not so. The treatise master himself says: "Now I correctly clarify the real meaning in the Tripiṭaka." The real meaning is emptiness. How could later teachers slander the treatise master? This is the emptiness-gate clarifying the positions of the twenty-seven worthy and sage who cut and subdue. The *Abhidharma* has a gate clarifying the positions of the seven worthy and seven sage who cut and subdue. The details are in the two treatises.

今略出有門中草之位：初：明七賢，次：明七聖位。

> Now briefly present the middle-herbs positions in the existence gate: first, clarify the seven worthy; second, clarify the seven sage positions.

七賢者：一、五停心。二、別相念處。三、總相念處。四、煗法。五、頂法。六、忍法。七、世第一法。通稱賢者，隣聖曰賢。能以似解伏見，因似發真，故言隣聖。

> The seven worthy: (1) five stopping-minds, (2) separate-aspect mindfulnesses, (3) general-aspect mindfulnesses, (4) warmth-dharma, (5) summit-dharma, (6) patience-dharma, (7) world-first-dharma. They are collectively called worthy; neighboring sages are called worthy. Able to use approximate understanding to subdue views, and from the approximate to generate the true; therefore called neighboring sages.

又天魔、外道，愛見流轉，不識四諦。此七位人明識四諦。《大經》云：「我昔與汝等不見四真諦」(云云)。見四諦者，識屬愛四諦，識屬見四諦，皆能明了。若解四諦，則所見真正，無有邪曲，故是賢人相也。

> Moreover, heavenly demons and non-Buddhists revolve in craving and views and do not know the Four Truths. These seven positions clearly know the Four Truths. The *Great Sutra* says: "In the past I and you did not see the four true truths" (and so on). Those who see the Four Truths understand the Four Truths that belong to craving, and understand the Four Truths that belong to views; all can be clearly understood. If one understands the Four Truths, then what one sees is truly correct, without any crookedness; therefore these are the marks of worthy persons.

一、初賢位者，謂學五停心，觀成，破五障道，即是初賢位。所以者何？若定邪聚眾生，不識三寶、四諦，貪染生死。若人歸依三寶，解四真諦，發心欲離生死、求涅槃樂。五種障道，煩惱散動，妨觀四諦。今修五觀成就，障破道明，行解相稱，故名初賢。

> First, the initial worthy position: those who study the five stopping-minds, their contemplation completes and breaks the five obstacles to the path—this is the initial worthy position. Why? If beings are fixed in wrong groupings, they do not know the Three Jewels or the Four Truths and greedily cling to birth and death. If a person takes refuge in the Three Jewels, understands the four true truths, and gives rise to the mind that wishes to leave birth and death and seek nirvāṇa joy. The five obstacles to the path—afflictions scattering and moving—obstruct contemplation of the Four Truths. Now cultivating the five contemplations to completion, the obstacles are broken and the path is clear; practice and understanding correspond, therefore it is called the initial worthy.

二、別相念處位者，以五障既除，觀慧諦當能觀四諦，而正以苦諦為初門，作四念處觀，破四顛倒。若慧解脫根性人，但修性四念處觀，破性執四倒。若俱解脫人，修共四念處觀，破事理四倒。若無疑解脫根性人，修性、共、緣三種四念處，破一切事、理、文字等四顛倒。善巧方便，於念處中，有四種精進，修四種定，生五善法，破五種惡，分別道用，安隱而行，能觀四諦，成別相四念處位也。

> Second, the separate-aspect mindfulness position: once the five obstacles are removed, contemplative wisdom should be able to contemplate the Four Truths, and precisely takes the Truth of Suffering as the initial gate, making the four mindfulness contemplations and breaking the four inversions. If one has the faculty-nature of wisdom-liberation, one only cultivates the intrinsic four mindfulness contemplations, breaking the intrinsic clinging of the four inversions. If one is a both-liberation person, one cultivates the shared four mindfulness contemplations, breaking the four inversions of phenomena and principle. If one has the faculty-nature of doubtless-liberation, one cultivates the intrinsic, shared, and conditioned three kinds of four mindfulnesses, breaking all four inversions of phenomena, principle, and words. With skillful expedients, within mindfulness there are four kinds of effort, cultivating four kinds of concentration, giving rise to five good dharmas, breaking five evil dharmas, discriminating the functions of the path, practicing peacefully and securely, able to contemplate the Four Truths, thus accomplishing the position of separate-aspect four mindfulnesses.

三總相四念處者，前已別相念慧破四顛倒，今深細觀慧，總破四倒。或境總觀總，境別觀總，境總觀別。或總二陰、三陰、四陰、五陰，皆名總相觀。是中，亦巧方便，能生正勤、如意、七覺、八道，疾入後法，故名總相念處位也。

> Third, the general-aspect four mindfulnesses: previously the separate-aspect mindfulness wisdom broke the four inversions; now with deep and subtle contemplative wisdom, one generally breaks the four inversions. Either the realm is generally contemplated as general, the realm is specifically contemplated as general, or the realm is generally contemplated as specific. Or one generally contemplates two aggregates, three aggregates, four aggregates, five aggregates, all called general-aspect contemplation. In this, there are also skillful expedients, able to give rise to right effort, rddhipāda, seven awakening factors, and eightfold path, quickly entering later dharmas; therefore it is called the general-aspect mindfulness position.

四、煗法位者，以別、總念處觀故，能發似解十六諦觀，得佛法氣分。譬如鑽火煙起，亦如春陽煖發，以慧鑽境，發相似解，解即喻煖。又如春夏積集華草，自有煖生，以四諦慧，集眾善法，善法熏積，慧解得起，故名煖也。即是內凡初位，佛弟子有、外道則無，是名煖法位。

> Fourth, the warmth-dharma position: because of separate and general mindfulness contemplation, one can give rise to approximate understanding of the sixteen truths, obtaining the share of Buddha-dharma. It is like drilling fire and smoke arises, or like spring sun warmth emerging; with wisdom one drills the realm and gives rise to approximate understanding, and the understanding is the simile of warmth. Again, like spring and summer gathering flowers and grasses, warmth naturally arises; with Four Truths wisdom one gathers many good dharmas; good dharmas are perfumed and accumulated; wisdom-understanding arises—therefore it is called warmth. This is the first inner-ordinary position; Buddha’s disciples have it, non-Buddhists do not—this is called the warmth-dharma position.

五、頂法者，似解轉增，得四如意定。十六諦觀，轉更分明。在煗之上，如登山頂，觀矚四方，悉皆明了，故名頂法。

> Fifth, the summit-dharma: approximate understanding further increases, attaining the four rddhi concentrations. The contemplation of the sixteen truths becomes still more clear. It is above warmth, like ascending a mountain summit and gazing in the four directions, all clearly understood; therefore it is called summit-dharma.

六、忍法位者，亦是似解增長。五種善法，增進成根。於四諦中，堪忍樂欲，故名忍法位。下、中二忍，皆名忍位。

> Sixth, the patience-dharma position: also approximate understanding grows. The five good dharmas increase and become roots. Within the Four Truths, one can endure and delight in desire; therefore it is called the patience-dharma position. The lower and middle two patiences are both called patience positions.

七、世第一法位者，即是上忍一剎那，於凡夫所得最勝善根，名為世間第一法也。上「智妙」中，已略說竟。

> Seventh, the world-first-dharma position: it is the single kṣaṇa of upper patience; the most superior good roots obtained by ordinary beings are called the world’s first dharma. In the above “Wisdom Subtlety,” this has already been briefly explained.

七、聖位者：一、隨信行。二、隨法行。三、信解。四、見得。五、身證。六、時解脫羅漢。七、不時解脫羅漢。通名聖者，正也。苦忍明發，捨凡性，入聖性。真智見理，故名聖人。

> Seven sage positions: (1) following-faith practice, (2) following-dharma practice, (3) faith-understanding, (4) view-attainment, (5) body-witness, (6) time-liberated arhat, (7) non-time-liberated arhat. Collectively named sages; “sage” means correct. When suffering-patience clarity arises, one abandons ordinary nature and enters sage nature. True wisdom sees principle; therefore they are called sages.

一、隨信行位者，是鈍根人，入見道之名也。非自智力，憑他生解。是人在方便道，先雖有信，以未習真，信不名行。行以進趣為義。從得苦忍真明，十五剎那進趣見真，故名隨信行位也。

> First, the following-faith practice position: this is the name for dull-root persons entering the path of seeing. Not by their own wisdom-power, they rely on others to give rise to understanding. This person is on the expedient path; though previously having faith, since they have not yet trained the true, the faith is not named practice. Practice means advancing. From obtaining the true clarity of suffering-patience, for fifteen kṣaṇas they advance and see the true; therefore it is called the following-faith practice position.

二、隨法行位者，即是利根入道之名也。利者，自以智力見理斷結。在方便道，能自用觀觀四真諦法，但未發真，不名為行。因世第一法發苦忍真明，十五剎那進趣見真，故名隨法行位也。

> Second, the following-dharma practice position: this is the name for sharp-root persons entering the path. The sharp ones use their own wisdom-power to see principle and cut fetters. On the expedient path they can themselves use contemplation to contemplate the four true truths, but the true has not yet arisen, so it is not called practice. From the world-first-dharma they give rise to the true clarity of suffering-patience; for fifteen kṣaṇas they advance and see the true; therefore it is called the following-dharma practice position.

三、明信解位者，即是信行人，入修道，轉名信解人也。鈍根憑信，進發真解，故名信解。是人證果有三，謂三果(云云)。證初果者，第十六道，比智相應，即證須陀洹。須陀洹，此翻修習無漏。《成論》明：「猶是見道數人」明證果即入修道，用此明修習無漏義便。若見道所斷，略言三結盡，廣說八十八使盡。七生在，終不至八(云云)。

> Third, the faith-understanding position: this is the faith-practice person entering the path of cultivation, changing name to faith-understanding. The dull-root relies on faith and advances to arouse true understanding, therefore called faith-understanding. This person has three fruits to be realized, namely the three fruits (and so on). As for realizing the first fruit: on the sixteenth path, concordant with comparative wisdom, one realizes the stream-enterer. Stream-enterer here is translated “cultivating the outflow-free.” The *Satyasiddhi* clarifies: “still counted among those on the path of seeing,” clarifying that realizing the fruit is entering the path of cultivation; using this to clarify the meaning of cultivating the outflow-free is convenient. As for what is cut on the path of seeing, in brief it is said the three fetters are exhausted; in detailed explanation, the eighty-eight afflictions are exhausted. There are seven rebirths, never reaching eight (and so on).

次、明證二果，即有二種：一、向。二、果。向者，從初果心後，更修十六諦觀，七菩提行現前，即此世無漏、斷煩惱。一品無礙，斷欲界一品煩惱，乃至斷五品，皆是於向，亦名勝進須陀洹。約此論家家也。二果者，若斷六品盡，證欲界第六品解脫，即是斯陀含果也。天竺云薄，薄欲界煩惱也。

> Next, clarifying the realization of the second fruit: there are two kinds, (1) path, (2) fruit. The path: after the first-fruit mind, one further cultivates the sixteen-truths contemplation; the seven bodhi practices appear, and in this very life one is outflow-free and cuts afflictions. For one grade unobstructed, cutting one grade of desire-realm afflictions, up to cutting five grades—these are all in the path, also named the advanced stream-enterer. In these treatises this is called “house-to-house.” The second fruit: if one cuts six grades fully and realizes the sixth-grade liberation of the desire realm, this is the fruit of once-returning. In India it is called “thin,” meaning the afflictions of the desire realm are thinned.

次、明證阿那含，亦有二：一、向。二、果。向者，若斷欲界七品，乃至八品，皆名為向，亦名勝進斯陀含。約此說一種子也。果者，九無礙斷欲界，若證第九解脫，即名阿那含果也。天竺云不還，不還生欲界也。

> Next, clarifying realization of non-returning also has two: (1) path, (2) fruit. The path: if one cuts seven grades of the desire realm up to eight grades, all are called path, also named advanced once-returner. According to this it is called one-seed. The fruit: the ninth unobstructed cuts the desire realm; if one realizes the ninth liberation, it is named the fruit of non-returning. In India it is called “not returning,” meaning not returning to birth in the desire realm.

復次須陀洹，有三種：一、行中須陀洹，即是向也。二、住果，正是須陀洹也。三、勝進須陀洹，亦名家家，即是斯陀含向也。斯陀含，但有二種：一、住果。二、勝進。勝進亦名一種子，即阿那含向也。阿那含亦二種：一、住果。二、勝進。勝進那含斷五上分結，謂色、無色染等，即阿羅漢向也。羅漢但有一，謂住果也。

> Furthermore, stream-enterer has three kinds: (1) stream-enterer in practice, that is, the path; (2) abiding in fruit, which is precisely the stream-enterer; (3) advanced stream-enterer, also named house-to-house, that is the path of once-returner. Once-returner has only two kinds: (1) abiding in fruit, (2) advanced. Advanced is also named one-seed, that is the path of non-returner. Non-returner also has two kinds: (1) abiding in fruit, (2) advanced. The advanced non-returner cuts the five higher fetters, namely the stains of form and formless, and so on; this is the path of arhat. Arhat has only one, namely abiding in fruit.

復次，超果者，凡夫時斷欲界六品乃至八品盡，來入見道，發苦忍真明。十五心中，是斯陀含向；十六心，即證斯陀含果也。若凡夫時，先斷二界九品盡，乃至無所有處盡，後入見諦十五心，名阿那含行。第十六心即證那含果，此名超越人，證後二果也。是信解雖是動，根性不同，謂：退、護、思、住、進也。

> Furthermore, those who transcend fruits: when ordinary people cut six grades up to eight grades of the desire realm fully, they come and enter the path of seeing and give rise to the true clarity of suffering-patience. Within fifteen minds, this is the path of once-returner; at the sixteenth mind, they realize the fruit of once-returner. If, while ordinary, they first cut the nine grades of the two realms completely, up to the realm of nothingness fully, then later enter the fifteen minds of seeing the truths, this is named non-returner practice. At the sixteenth mind they realize the fruit of non-returner. This is called the transcender, realizing the latter two fruits. This faith-understanding, though moving, has differing root natures, namely: retreating, protecting, thinking, abiding, advancing.

若證阿那含，各復有五及七種般、八種般。五種般者：中般、生般、行般、不行般、上流般也。七種者，開中般為三種也。八種般者，五如前，更有現般、無色般、不定般(云云)。

> If one realizes non-returning, each again has five and seven kinds of nirvāṇa, and eight kinds of nirvāṇa. The five kinds: intermediate nirvāṇa, birth nirvāṇa, practice nirvāṇa, non-practice nirvāṇa, and upward-flow nirvāṇa. The seven kinds: the intermediate nirvāṇa is opened into three kinds. The eight kinds: the five as before, plus present nirvāṇa, formless nirvāṇa, and indeterminate nirvāṇa (and so on).

四、明見得位者，法行人轉入修道，名為見得。是利根人，自以智勳，見法得理，故名見得。是人在思惟道，次第證三果，超越二果，亦如信解中分別。但以利根，不藉聞法，不假眾具，自能見法，得理為異也。見得但是不動根性。若證阿那含果，亦有五種、七種、八種般不同也。

> Fourth, clarifying the view-attainment position: the dharma-practice person turns and enters the path of cultivation, named view-attainment. This is a sharp-root person who, by their own wisdom effort, sees dharma and attains principle; therefore named view-attainment. This person is on the path of contemplation, sequentially realizing the three fruits and transcending the two fruits, likewise differentiated as in faith-understanding. But because of sharp roots, not relying on hearing dharma and not relying on assemblies, they themselves can see dharma and attain principle—this is the difference. View-attainment is only the immovable root nature. If one realizes the non-returner fruit, there are also five, seven, and eight kinds of nirvāṇa differing.

五、明身證位者，還是信解、見到二人，入思惟道，用無漏智，斷上下分結，發四禪、四無色定。即是用共念處，修八背捨、八勝處、十一切處，入九次第定。三空事、性兩障先已斷盡，又斷非想事障，滅緣理諸心、心數法，入滅盡定。得此定故，名身證阿那含也。何者？入滅定似涅槃法，安置身內，息三界一切勞務。身證想受滅，故名身證也。

> Fifth, clarifying the body-witness position: still the two persons of faith-understanding and view-attainment enter the path of contemplation, using outflow-free wisdom to cut the upper and lower fetters and give rise to the four dhyānas and four formless concentrations. That is, using shared mindfulness to cultivate the eight liberations, eight victories, and eleven universals, entering the nine successive concentrations. The two obstructions of the three empties in matters and nature have already been cut completely; further they cut the matter-obstruction of neither-perception, extinguish minds and mental factors that condition principle, and enter the cessation concentration. Because of attaining this concentration, it is named the body-witness non-returner. Why? Entering cessation concentration is like the dharma of nirvāṇa, placed within the body, resting all toil of the three realms. The body witnesses the cessation of perception and feeling; therefore it is called body-witness.

若約初果解身證者，但以先於凡夫，用等智斷結，得四禪、四無色定，後得見諦，第十六心，證那含果，即修共念處，還從欲界修背捨、勝處、一切處，入九次第定身證也。是阿那含有二種：一、住果、但是阿那含也。二、帶果行向、即是勝進阿那含也，亦是羅漢向攝。《釋論》云：「那含有十一種：五種正是阿那含，六種阿羅漢向攝。」此身證者，即是勝進，為羅漢向攝。五種、七種般，皆有上流般。八種般，但有現般、無色般也。《毘曇》分別那含，有一萬二千九百六十種(云云)。

> If one explains body-witness by the first fruit: only because previously while an ordinary person, using equal wisdom they cut fetters, attained the four dhyānas and four formless concentrations; later they obtained seeing the truths, and at the sixteenth mind realized the non-returner fruit; then they cultivate shared mindfulness, returning from the desire realm to cultivate the liberations, victories, and universals, entering the nine successive concentrations and body-witnessing. The non-returner has two kinds: (1) abiding in fruit, which is simply non-returner; (2) carrying fruit and practicing toward, which is the advanced non-returner, also included in the path of arhat. The *Śāstra* says: "Non-returner has eleven kinds: five are truly non-returner; six are included in the arhat path." This body-witness is advanced and is included in the arhat path. The five and seven kinds of nirvāṇa all have upward-flow nirvāṇa. The eight kinds of nirvāṇa only have present nirvāṇa and formless nirvāṇa. The *Abhidharma* distinguishes non-returners, having twelve thousand nine hundred sixty kinds (and so on).

六、明時解脫羅漢者，是信行鈍根，待時及眾緣具，方得解脫，故名時解脫羅漢。羅漢，此無翻，名含三義：殺賊、不生、應供也。位居無學。

> Sixth, clarifying the time-liberated arhat: this is the faith-practice dull root, waiting for time and the completion of many conditions to attain liberation; therefore named time-liberated arhat. Arhat is not translated; the name contains three meanings: slaying thieves, not being born, and worthy of offerings. The position is among the non-learners.

羅漢有五種：隨信行生，退法、思法、護法、住法、升進法也。得盡智、無學等見也。若用金剛三昧，於非想九品惑盡。次一剎那，證非想第九解脫，成盡智。次一剎那，得無學等見也。或彼時退故，不說得無生智。此五種阿羅漢，是信種性，根鈍，因中修道，必假衣、食、床具、處所、說法、及人，隨順善根增進，不能一切時所欲進也。是五種各有二種：不得滅盡定，但是慧解脫；得滅盡定，即是俱解脫。若不得滅盡定，是人因中偏修性念處。若得滅盡定，是人因中修性共也。證果時，三明、八解，一時俱得，故名俱解脫也。

> There are five kinds of arhat: arising from following-faith practice, and the dharmas of retreat, thinking, protecting, abiding, and advancing. They attain exhaustion-knowledge and the views of non-learning. If using vajra samādhi, in the nine grades of neither-perception the afflictions are exhausted. Next, in one kṣaṇa, they realize the ninth liberation of neither-perception and become exhaustion-knowledge. Next, in one kṣaṇa, they attain the views of non-learning. Or at that time, because of retreat, it is not said that they attain non-arising knowledge. These five kinds of arhats are faith-seed nature, roots dull; in the cause they cultivate the path and must rely on clothing, food, bedding, places, speaking dharma, and persons. They follow along and increase good roots, and cannot at all times advance as they wish. These five kinds each have two kinds: not attaining cessation concentration, they are only wisdom-liberated; attaining cessation concentration, they are both-liberated. If not attaining cessation concentration, that person in the cause side-cultivates the nature mindfulness. If attaining cessation concentration, that person in the cause cultivates the nature and shared. At the time of realizing the fruit, the three clarities and eight liberations are obtained all at once; therefore they are named both-liberated.

七、不時解脫羅漢者，即是法行利根，名不動法阿羅漢也。此人因中修道，能一切時，隨所欲進修善業，不待眾具，故名不時解脫。是人不為煩惱所動，故名不動。不動是不退義。成就三智：謂盡智、無生智、無學等見。能用重空三昧，擊聖善法，以定捨定，故言能擊。

> Seventh, the non-time-liberated arhat is the sharp-root dharma-practice person, named the immovable-dharma arhat. This person cultivates the path in the cause and can, at all times, according to what is desired, advance in cultivating good karma, not waiting for assemblies and resources; therefore named non-time-liberated. This person is not moved by afflictions, therefore named immovable. Immovable means non-retreat. They accomplish the three wisdoms: exhaustion-knowledge, non-arising knowledge, and the views of non-learning. They can use deep emptiness samādhi to strike the holy good dharmas, using concentration to relinquish concentration; therefore it is said they can strike.

是不動羅漢亦有二種：一、不得滅盡定，但名慧解脫。二、得滅盡定，即是俱解脫。若聞佛說三藏教門，修緣念處，即發四辯，名無疑解脫。是名波羅蜜聲聞，能究竟具足一切羅漢功德也。名沙門那，沙門那者沙門果也。

> This immovable arhat also has two kinds: (1) not attaining cessation concentration, only named wisdom-liberated; (2) attaining cessation concentration, then is both-liberated. If hearing the Buddha’s teaching-gates of the Tripiṭaka and cultivating conditioned mindfulness, they then give rise to the four elocutions, named doubtless liberation. This is called the pāramitā śrāvaka, able to ultimately and fully possess all arhat merits. Named śramaṇa; śramaṇa means śramaṇa fruit.

二、明辟支佛位者，此翻緣覺。此人宿世福厚，神根猛利，能觀集諦以為初門。《大論》稱獨覺、因緣覺。若出無佛世，自然悟道，此即獨覺；若出佛世，聞十二因緣法，稟此得道，故名因緣覺。獨覺生無佛世，有小、有大。若本在學人，今生佛後，七生既滿，不受八生，自然成道，不名為佛，亦非羅漢，名小辟支迦羅。論其道力，不及舍利弗等大羅漢。二者、大辟支迦羅，二百劫中作功德身，得三十二相分，或三十一、三十、二十九，乃至一相。福力增長，智慧利，於總相、別相，能知、能入。久修集定，常樂獨處，故名大辟支迦羅也。若就因緣論小大者，亦應如是分別。此人根利，不須制果，能斷正使，又加侵習，譬如身壯，直到所在，不中止息，故不制果，是名中草位竟。

> Second, clarifying the pratyekabuddha position: this is translated “conditioned awakening.” This person in past lives had abundant merit, with sharp spiritual faculties, able to contemplate the truth of accumulation as the initial gate. The *Śāstra* calls them solitary awakened and condition-awakened. If they emerge in a world without a Buddha, they awaken the path naturally; this is solitary awakened. If they emerge in a Buddha’s world, hear the twelve links of dependent origination, and receive this to attain the path, therefore called condition-awakened. Solitary awakened are born in a world without a Buddha; there are small and great. If originally a trainee, and now born after a Buddha, when seven lives are completed, they do not receive an eighth life and naturally attain the path; not called Buddha, and not arhat, named small pratyekabuddha. As to their path power, they do not match great arhats like Śāriputra and the like. Second, great pratyekabuddha: over two hundred eons they create a body of merit, attaining portions of the thirty-two marks—perhaps thirty-one, thirty, twenty-nine, down to one mark. Their merit power increases; wisdom is sharp; in general and specific aspects they can know and enter. Long cultivating collected concentration, they constantly delight in solitude; therefore named great pratyekabuddha. If one discusses small and great by conditions, it should also be distinguished thus. This person’s roots are sharp; they do not need to “control the fruit”; they can cut proper afflictions and further encroach on habits—like a strong body, going straight to the place without stopping midway; therefore not “controlling the fruit.” This is named the completion of the middle-herb positions.

上草位者，即是三藏菩薩位也。此菩薩從初發菩提心，起慈悲誓願，觀察四諦，以道諦為初門，行六波羅蜜。

> Upper herb positions are the Tripiṭaka bodhisattva positions. This bodhisattva, from the initial arousing of the bodhi mind, gives rise to compassionate vows, contemplates the Four Truths, taking the Path Truth as the initial gate, and practices the six pāramitās.

從初釋迦至罽那尸棄佛時，名第一阿僧祇劫。常離女人身，亦不自知當作佛、不作佛。準望二乘位，應在五停心、別相總相念處位中，以慈悲心，行六度行也。從罽那尸棄佛至然燈佛時，名第二阿僧祇劫。爾時雖自知作佛，而口不說，準望此位，應在煗法位中，即是性地、順忍，初心之位。既有證法之信，必知作佛。而用煗解，修行六度，心未分明，故口不向他說也。從然燈佛至毘婆尸佛時，名第三阿僧祇劫。是時內心了了，自知作佛，口自發言，無所畏難。準此位，應在頂法位中，修行六度，四諦解明，如登山頂，了見四方，故口向他說也。

> From the initial Śākyamuni to the time of Jinanashiqi Buddha, this is named the first incalculable eon. One constantly separates from a woman’s body and does not yet know whether one will become Buddha or not. Comparing with the Two Vehicle positions, it should be within the five stopping-minds and the separate and general mindfulness positions, with a compassionate mind practicing the six pāramitās. From Jinanashiqi Buddha to Dīpaṃkara Buddha, this is named the second incalculable eon. At that time, though one knows oneself will become Buddha, one does not speak it with the mouth. Comparing this position, it should be within the warmth-dharma position, namely the nature ground and compliant patience, the position of initial mind. Since there is faith in the attainment of dharma, one must know one will become Buddha; yet with warmth-understanding, practicing the six pāramitās, the mind is not yet clear, therefore one does not speak it to others. From Dīpaṃkara Buddha to Vipaśyin Buddha, this is named the third incalculable eon. At that time, the inner mind is clearly clear; knowing oneself will become Buddha, the mouth speaks it itself, without fear or difficulty. Comparing this position, it should be in the summit-dharma position; practicing the six pāramitās, the Four Truths understanding is clear, like ascending a mountain summit and seeing the four directions clearly; therefore the mouth speaks it to others.

若過三僧祇劫，種三十二相業者，準此是下忍之位。用此忍智，行六度成百福德，用百福成一相因，於下忍之位，人中佛出世時得種也。

> If one passes the three incalculable eons and plants the karma of the thirty-two marks, by comparison this is the lower patience position. Using this patience wisdom, practicing the six pāramitās to complete one hundred merits, using the hundred merits to make the cause of one mark, at the lower patience position, when a Buddha appears in the world of humans one obtains the seed.

若坐道場時，位在中忍、上忍。從上忍，一剎那入真，三十四心斷結，得阿耨三菩提，則名為佛。爾前則是三藏菩薩上草之位也。

> If at the time of sitting at the bodhimaṇḍa, the position is in middle patience and upper patience. From upper patience, in one kṣaṇa one enters the true, with thirty-four minds cutting fetters and obtaining anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, then named Buddha. Before that is the upper herb position of the Tripiṭaka bodhisattva.

小樹位者，即是通教，明三乘之人，同以無言說道，斷煩惱，入第一義諦。體法觀慧不異，但智力強弱之殊，煩惱習有盡、不盡為異耳。

> The small tree position is the Common Teaching, clarifying that the three-vehicle persons together use the wordless path, cut afflictions, and enter the first-meaning truth. Embodied-dharma contemplative wisdom is not different; only the distinction of strong and weak wisdom power, and whether affliction habits are exhausted or not exhausted, is the difference.

先明三乘共十地位，次簡名別義通(云云)。

> First clarify the ten grounds positions common to the three vehicles; next briefly distinguish names that are distinct but meaning is common (and so on).

一、乾慧地者，三乘之初，同名乾慧，即是體法，五停心、別相總相四念處觀。事相不異三藏。此三階法門，體陰、入、界如幻如化，總破見、愛八倒，名身念處。受、心、法亦如是。住是觀中，修正勤、如意、根、力、覺、道。雖未得煗法相似理水，而總相智慧深利，故稱乾慧位也。

> First, the dry-wisdom ground: at the beginning of the three vehicles, all are named dry-wisdom—this is embodied-dharma, the five stopping-minds and the separate and general four mindfulness contemplations. The aspects of matters are not different from the Tripiṭaka. These three-stage dharma-gates embody the aggregates, entrances, and realms as illusion and transformation, generally breaking the eight inversions of view and craving, named body mindfulness. Feeling, mind, and dharmas are also thus. Dwelling in these contemplations, one cultivates right effort, rddhi, roots, powers, awakening factors, and path. Though one has not yet obtained the warmth-dharma’s similar principle water, the general-aspect wisdom is deep and sharp; therefore it is called the dry-wisdom ground.

二、性地位者，得過乾慧，得煗已，能增進初、中、後心，入頂法，乃至世第一法，皆名性地。性地中，無生方便，解慧善巧，轉勝於前，得相似無漏性水，故言性地也。

> Second, the nature-ground position: having passed dry-wisdom and obtained warmth, one can increase the initial, middle, and later minds, entering summit-dharma up to world-first-dharma, all named nature-ground. Within the nature-ground, the non-arising expedient, understanding-wisdom skillful, becomes superior to before, attaining similar outflow-free nature-water; therefore it is called nature-ground.

三、八人地位者，即是三乘信行、法行二人，體見假以發真斷惑，在無間三昧中，八忍具足，智少一分，故名八人位也。

> Third, the eight-person ground: this is the two persons of faith-practice and dharma-practice of the three vehicles, embodying views and provisional to give rise to the true and cut afflictions; in the uninterrupted samādhi, eight patiences are complete, with wisdom short by one part; therefore it is called the eight-person ground.

四、見地位者，即是三乘同見第一義無生四諦之理，同斷見惑八十八使盡也。

> Fourth, the seeing-ground: this is the three vehicles together seeing the principle of the non-arising Four Truths of the first meaning, together cutting the view afflictions, the eighty-eight bonds fully.

五、薄地位者，體愛假即真，發六品無礙，斷欲界六品，證第六解脫，欲界煩惱薄也。

> Fifth, the thin ground: embodying craving’s provisional as true, one gives rise to six grades of unobstructedness, cuts six grades of the desire realm, realizes the sixth liberation; the desire-realm afflictions are thinned.

六、離欲地位者，即是三乘之人，體愛假即真，斷欲界五下分結盡，離欲界煩惱也。

> Sixth, the free-from-desire ground: that is the persons of the three vehicles, embodying craving’s provisional as true, cutting the five lower fetters of the desire realm completely, free from desire-realm afflictions.

七、已辦地位者，即是三乘之人，體色、無色愛即真，發真無漏，斷五上分結七十二品盡也。斷三界事惑究竟，故言已辦地。

> Seventh, the done-what-is-to-be-done ground: that is the persons of the three vehicles, embodying form and formless craving as true, giving rise to true outflow-free, cutting the five upper fetters of seventy-two grades completely. Cutting the three-realm matter afflictions completely, therefore it is called the done-what-is-to-be-done ground.

八、辟支佛地位者，緣覺菩薩發真無漏，功德力大故，能侵除習氣也。

> Eighth, the pratyekabuddha ground: the condition-awakened bodhisattva gives rise to true outflow-free; because their merit power is great, they can encroach and remove habitual tendencies.

九、菩薩地位者，從空入假，道觀雙流，深觀二諦，進斷習氣色心無知，得法眼、道種智，遊戲神通，淨佛國土，成就眾生，學佛十力四無所畏，斷習氣將盡也。齊此名小樹位也。

> Ninth, the bodhisattva ground: from emptiness one enters the provisional, the path contemplations flow in both; deeply contemplate the Two Truths, advance to cut habitual tendencies—form-mind ignorance—attain the dharma eye and the path-seed wisdom, play in supernatural powers, purify Buddha lands, accomplish sentient beings, study the Buddha’s ten powers and four fearlessnesses, cutting habitual tendencies nearly to completion. Up to here it is named the small tree position.

十、佛地者，大功德力資智慧、一念相應慧，觀真諦究竟，習亦究竟。如劫火燒木，無復炭灰。如象渡河，到於邊底。雖菩薩、佛名異二乘，通俱觀無生體法，同是無學，得二涅槃，共歸灰斷，證果處一，故稱為通也。

> Tenth, the Buddha ground: great merit power supports wisdom; with a single thought concordant wisdom, one contemplates the true truth to completion; habits are also complete. It is like kalpa fire burning wood, leaving no charcoal or ash; like an elephant crossing a river, arriving at the far bank. Though bodhisattva and Buddha are named differently from the two vehicles, the Common Teaching together contemplates the non-arising embodied-dharma, both are non-learners, attaining the two nirvāṇas, together returning to ashes and extinction, with the realized fruit place as one; therefore it is called “Common.”
