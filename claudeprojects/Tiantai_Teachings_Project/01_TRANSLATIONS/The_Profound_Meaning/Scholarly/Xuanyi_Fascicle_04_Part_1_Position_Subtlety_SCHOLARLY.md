## ○第四明位妙
# The Fourth [Subtlety]: Position Subtlety

---

### Why Position After Practice

諦理既融，智圓無隔，導行成妙。三義已顯，體、宗、用足。更明位妙者，行之所階也。

> Principle-truth being fused, wisdom complete without obstruction, guiding practice to subtle—these three meanings are already revealed, encompassing substance, essence, and function. **Why further clarify Position Subtlety? Because [positions are] the stages that practice ascends.**

---

### The Variety of Position Teachings

但位有權實，布在經論。

> **Positions have expedient and real [versions], spread throughout the sūtras and śāstras.**

若《成論》、《毘曇》判位，言不涉大。《地》、《攝》等論判位，別敘一途，義不兼括。

> If the *Satyasiddhi-śāstra* and *Abhidharma* determine positions, their language does not reach the great [vehicle]. The *Daśabhūmika*, *Mahāyānasaṃgraha* and other śāstras determine positions separately in one line, their meanings not mutually encompassing.

方等諸經明位，《瓔珞》已判淺深。般若諸經明位，《仁王》盛談高下而未彰麁妙。

> The various *Vaipulya* sūtras clarify positions; the *Yingluo Jing* has already determined shallow and deep. The various *Prajñā* sūtras clarify positions; the *Renwang Jing* abundantly discusses high and low yet has not manifested coarse and subtle.

今經位名不彰，而意兼小大，粗判權實...

> **This present sūtra does not manifest position names, yet its meaning encompasses small and great, roughly determining expedient and real...**

## The Six Positions in the Medicinal Herbs Parable

今〈藥草喻品〉但明六位。

> Now the *Medicinal Herbs Parable Chapter* clarifies only **six positions**.

---

### Position 1-3: Small Herbs (小藥草) = Tripiṭaka

文云：「轉輪聖王、釋、梵諸王，是小藥草。知無漏法，能得涅槃…，獨處山林，…得緣覺證，是中藥草。求世尊處，我當作佛，行精進定，是上藥草。」

> The text says: "**Wheel-turning sage kings, Indra, Brahmā and various kings—these are small herbs.** Knowing the outflow-free dharmas, able to attain nirvāṇa... dwelling alone in mountain forests... attaining Pratyekabuddha realization—**these are middle herbs.** Seeking the World-Honored One's place, 'I shall become Buddha,' practicing energetic concentration—**these are upper herbs.**"

前三義是藏中位；

> **The former three meanings are positions within the Tripiṭaka.**

---

### Position 4: Small Trees (小樹) = Common Teaching

又諸佛子，專心佛道，常行慈悲，自知作佛，決定無疑，是名小樹。

> "Also the Buddha's children, single-mindedly [pursuing] the Buddha path, constantly practicing compassion, knowing themselves to become Buddha, definitely without doubt—**these are called small trees.**"

小樹是通位；

> **Small trees are Common Teaching positions.**

---

### Position 5: Great Trees (大樹) = Distinct Teaching

安住神通，轉不退輪，度無量億百千眾生…，是名大樹。

> "**Abiding peacefully in supernatural powers, turning the non-regressing wheel, liberating immeasurable hundred-thousands of sentient beings...**—these are called **great trees**."

大樹是別位；

> **Great trees are Distinct Teaching positions.**

---

### Position 6: The Real Thing = Perfect Teaching

追取長行中「一地所生，一雨所潤」，及後文云：「今當為汝說最實事」以為第六位也。

> Tracing back to the prose: "**One ground gives rise [to all], one rain moistens [all]**," and the later text: "**Now I shall speak the most real matter for you**"—this makes the sixth position.

最實事是圓位也。

> **"The most real matter" is the Perfect Teaching position.**

---

### Summary Table: Six Positions

| Position | Chapter Symbol | Teaching | Content |
|----------|---------------|----------|---------|
| 1 | **Small Herbs** | Tripiṭaka | Human/heavenly beings |
| 2 | **Middle Herbs** | Tripiṭaka | Two Vehicles (Śrāvaka, Pratyekabuddha) |
| 3 | **Upper Herbs** | Tripiṭaka | Tripiṭaka Bodhisattvas |
| 4 | **Small Trees** | Common | Three vehicles via body-dharma |
| 5 | **Great Trees** | Distinct | Separate bodhisattva path |
| 6 | **The Real Thing** | Perfect | One Vehicle, most real |

---

## Small Herbs: Human and Heavenly Positions

小草位者，人天乘也。輪王是人主位，釋梵是天主位，皆約報果明位。

> **Small herbs position is the human-heavenly vehicle.** Wheel-turning king is the human ruler position; Indra and Brahmā are celestial ruler positions. Both determine position according to retribution-fruit.

---

### Human Realm Positions

人位因者，即是秉持五戒，略為四品：

> Human position causes—namely upholding the five precepts, roughly divided into four grades:

| Grade | Precept Quality | Reward |
|-------|-----------------|--------|
| Lower | Basic five precepts | Iron-wheel king (one continent) |
| Middle | Moderate practice | Bronze-wheel king (two continents) |
| Upper | Strong practice | Silver-wheel king (three continents) |
| Highest | Excellent practice | Gold-wheel king (four continents) |

皆是散心持戒，兼以慈心勸他為福故，報為人主，飛行皇帝，四方歸德，神寶自然應也。

> All are scattered-mind precept keeping, combined with compassionate mind urging others to merit—hence their retribution is human rulership, a flying emperor, with the four directions returning to virtue, and divine treasures naturally responding.

---

### Heavenly Realm Positions

天乘位者，修十善道，任運淳熟，通是天因，加修禪定，進升上界。

> **Heavenly vehicle positions**: cultivating the ten wholesome paths until naturally mature—this is the universal heavenly cause. Adding cultivation of meditation, one ascends to higher realms.

三界天果，高下不同，修因必深淺異也。

> The three-realm heavenly fruits differ in height—the cultivated causes necessarily differ in depth.

---

## Middle Herbs: Two Vehicles

中藥草位者，即二乘也。

> **Middle herbs position is the Two Vehicles.**

---

### Seven Worthy Ones (七賢)

七賢者：一、五停心。二、別相念處。三、總相念處。四、煗法。五、頂法。六、忍法。七、世第一法。

> **Seven Worthy Ones:**
> 1. Five Stilling-Hearts
> 2. Separate-aspect Mindfulness
> 3. General-aspect Mindfulness
> 4. Warmth-dharma
> 5. Summit-dharma
> 6. Patience-dharma
> 7. World-First-dharma

通稱賢者，隣聖曰賢。能以似解伏見，因似發真，故言隣聖。

> All are called "worthy" because **neighboring sagehood is called worthiness**. Able to use approximate understanding to subdue views, from the approximate to generate the true—hence called "neighboring sagehood."

---

### Seven Sages (七聖)

七、聖位者：一、隨信行。二、隨法行。三、信解。四、見得。五、身證。六、時解脫羅漢。七、不時解脫羅漢。

> **Seven Sage positions:**
> 1. Following-Faith Practice
> 2. Following-Dharma Practice
> 3. Faith-Understanding
> 4. View-Attainment
> 5. Body-Witness
> 6. Time-Liberation Arhat
> 7. Non-Time-Liberation Arhat

通名聖者，正也。苦忍明發，捨凡性，入聖性。真智見理，故名聖人。

> All are called "sages" because **"sage" means correct**. When suffering-patience clarity arises, one abandons ordinary nature and enters sage nature. **True wisdom sees principle—hence called "sage."**

---

## Upper Herbs: Tripiṭaka Bodhisattvas

上草位者，即是三藏菩薩位也。此菩薩從初發菩提心，起慈悲誓願，觀察四諦，以道諦為初門，行六波羅蜜。

> **Upper herbs position is the Tripiṭaka bodhisattva position.** This bodhisattva, from the initial arousing of *bodhi*-mind, generates compassionate vow-wishes, contemplates the Four Noble Truths, taking Path-truth as the initial gate, and practices the six *pāramitās*.

---

### The Three Incalculable Eons

從初釋迦至罽那尸棄佛時，名第一阿僧祇劫。常離女人身，亦不自知當作佛、不作佛。

> From the initial Śākyamuni to the time of Kāśyapa Buddha, this is named the **first incalculable eon**. [The bodhisattva] constantly separates from female bodies, and does not yet know whether he will become Buddha or not.

從罽那尸棄佛至然燈佛時，名第二阿僧祇劫。爾時雖自知作佛，而口不說...

> From Kāśyapa Buddha to Dīpaṃkara Buddha, this is named the **second incalculable eon**. At that time, though knowing oneself will become Buddha, one does not speak it aloud...

從然燈佛至毘婆尸佛時，名第三阿僧祇劫。是時內心了了，自知作佛，口自發言，無所畏難。

> From Dīpaṃkara Buddha to Vipaśyin Buddha, this is named the **third incalculable eon**. At this time, the inner mind is clear; knowing oneself will become Buddha, one speaks aloud without fear or difficulty.

---

## Small Trees: Common Teaching Ten Grounds

小樹位者，即是通教，明三乘之人，同以無言說道，斷煩惱，入第一義諦。

> **Small trees position is the Common Teaching**, clarifying that the three-vehicle persons **together use the wordless path, cutting afflictions, entering ultimate truth**.

體法觀慧不異，但智力強弱之殊，煩惱習有盡、不盡為異耳。

> Body-dharma contemplative wisdom is not different; only the strength and weakness of wisdom-power differs, and [whether] affliction habits are exhausted or not exhausted makes the difference.

---

### Common Teaching Ten Grounds

| # | Ground | Content |
|---|--------|---------|
| 1 | **Dry Wisdom** (乾慧地) | Body-dharma mindfulness, no samādhi-water yet |
| 2 | **Nature** (性地) | Warmth through World-First-dharma |
| 3 | **Eight-Person** (八人地) | Eight patiences complete, one wisdom short |
| 4 | **Seeing** (見地) | Sees ultimate non-arising Four Truths |
| 5 | **Thin** (薄地) | Desire-realm afflictions thinned |
| 6 | **Free-from-Desire** (離欲地) | Five lower fetters exhausted |
| 7 | **Done-What-Is-To-Be-Done** (已辦地) | All three-realm afflictions cut |
| 8 | **Pratyekabuddha** (辟支佛地) | Encroaches on habitual tendencies |
| 9 | **Bodhisattva** (菩薩地) | Exits emptiness into provisional, dual observation |
| 10 | **Buddha** (佛地) | One thought completes all |

---

## Great Trees: Distinct Teaching Positions

大樹位者，別教位也。此別教，名、義、理、惑、智、斷，皆別。

> **Great trees position is the Distinct Teaching position.** This Distinct Teaching—names, meanings, principle, delusion, wisdom, cutting—**all are distinct**.

此正約因緣假名、恒沙佛法、如來藏理、常住涅槃、無量四諦而論位次。

> This is precisely about **dependent-origination provisional names, Ganges-sands Buddha-dharmas, Tathāgatagarbha principle, eternal-abiding nirvāṇa, and immeasurable Four Truths**—discussing the position sequence.

---

### Distinct Teaching Fifty-Two Positions

今判位名數，依《纓珞》、《仁王》者...《纓珞》五十二位，名義整足...

> Now determining position name-numbers, following the *Yingluo* and *Renwang*... The *Yingluo* [teaches] **fifty-two positions**, with complete name-meanings...

| Stage | Positions | Status |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| **Ten Faiths** (十信) | 1-10 | Outer ordinary, dry wisdom, subduing patience |
| **Ten Abidings** (十住) | 11-20 | Inner ordinary, cutting interface delusion |
| **Ten Practices** (十行) | 21-30 | Exiting emptiness into provisional |
| **Ten Dedications** (十迴向) | 31-40 | Cultivating Middle Way |
| **Ten Grounds** (十地) | 41-50 | Breaking ignorance, seeing Buddha-nature |
| **Equal Awakening** (等覺) | 51 | Diamond-mind, nearly Buddha |
| **Wondrous Awakening** (妙覺) | 52 | Ultimate Buddhahood |

---

## Coarse and Subtle Judgment

若開麁顯妙，無麁可待，即絕待行妙意也。

> **If we open the coarse to reveal the subtle, there is no coarse to contrast—this is the Absolute Practice Subtlety meaning.**

---

## Footnotes

[^1]: The **Six Positions** (六位) from the Medicinal Herbs chapter provide Master Zhiyi's framework for understanding all the different path structures across Buddhism. Just as different plants grow to different heights from the same rain, practitioners of different capacities attain different levels from the same Dharma rain.
