# Part One: Essence/Aim (宗) — The Third of Five Chapters

## △大章第三、明宗

宗者，修行之喉衿，顯體之要蹊，如梁柱持屋，結網綱維。

> "**Essence** is the **throat** of practice, the **key pathway** to revealing Substance. Like **pillars holding a house**, like the **main cord of a net**."

提維則目動，梁安則桷存。

> "**Lift the cord, and the mesh moves; set the beam, and the rafters stand.**"

---

## Five Topics on Essence

釋宗為五：一、簡宗體。二、正明宗。三、眾經同異。四、明麁妙。五、結因果。

> Explaining Essence has **five topics**:
> 1. Distinguishing Essence from Substance
> 2. Directly clarifying Essence
> 3. Sameness and difference with other sūtras
> 4. Coarse and subtle
> 5. Concluding with cause-and-fruit

---

## Distinguishing Essence from Substance

有人言：宗即是體，體即是宗。今所不用。

> "Some say: 'Essence is Substance, Substance is Essence.' **I don't use this**."

宗致既是因果，因果即二體...體若不二，體即非宗。

> "**Essence's point is cause-and-fruit**; cause-and-fruit are two... If Substance is non-dual, Substance is not Essence."

不異而異，約非因非果而論因果，故有宗體之別耳。

> "**Not-different yet different**: According to non-cause-non-fruit, we discuss cause-and-fruit—hence the distinction between Essence and Substance."

## Rejecting Previous Interpretations

| Interpreter | Interpretation | Why Rejected |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| Master Yuan | One Vehicle as Essence | Too broad—doesn't include beginning-to-end |
| Master Long | Fruit alone as Essence | Fruit doesn't stand alone; ignores cause |
| Others | Cause alone | Ignores the complete fruit |
| Others | Expedient-Real as Essence | Expedient is what this sūtra abandons |
| Others | Awakening as Essence | Awakening is only fruit, no cause |

---

## The Correct Essence: One-Vehicle Cause-and-Fruit

二、正明宗者，此經始從〈序品〉訖〈安樂行品〉...為成弟子實因，因正果傍...從〈涌出品〉訖〈勸發品〉...而顯師之實果，果正因傍。

> "**Directly clarifying Essence**: This sūtra from *Introduction* to *Peaceful Practices* [Chapters 1-14]... **establishes disciples' real cause—cause is primary, fruit is secondary**... From *Emerging from Earth* to *Encouragement* [Chapters 15-28]... **reveals the Teacher's real fruit—fruit is primary, cause is secondary**."

合前因果共為經宗，意在於此。

> "**Combining both cause-and-fruit together makes the sūtra's Essence**—the meaning is in this."

---

## The Two Halves of the Sūtra

| Half | Chapters | Content | Focus |
|------|----------|---------|-------|
| **Trace Gate** (迹門) | 1-14 | Opening expedient, revealing real | **Cause** primary |
| **Fundamental Gate** (本門) | 15-28 | Revealing original lifespan | **Fruit** primary |

所以經分二文，論本論迹...師弟權實，總在其間也。

> "Hence the sūtra divides into two texts, discussing Fundamental and Trace... Teacher-and-disciple, expedient-and-real—all are within this."

---

# Part Two: Function/Power (用) — The Fourth of Five Chapters

## △大章第四、明用

用是如來之妙能，此經之勝用。

> "**Function** is the Tathāgata's **subtle ability**, this sūtra's **superior power**."

如來以權實二智為妙能，此經以斷疑生信為勝用。

> "The Tathāgata takes **expedient-and-real two wisdoms** as subtle ability. This sūtra takes **breaking doubt and generating faith** as superior power."

---

## Distinguishing Function from Essence

宗亦有用，用亦有宗。宗用非用用，用用非宗用。

> "Essence also has function; Function also has essence. **Essence's function is not Function's function; Function's function is not Essence's function.**"

宗用者，因果是宗，因果各有斷伏為用...

> "Essence's function: Cause-and-fruit is essence; cause-and-fruit each have subduing as function..."

用有宗者，慈悲為用宗，斷疑生信為用用。

> "Function has essence: **Compassion** is Function's essence; **breaking doubt, generating faith** is Function's function."

---

## The Unique Function of This Sūtra

諸經不純明佛智慧...不正破廢二乘果...如此力用，眾經所無，今經具之。

> "Other sūtras don't purely clarify Buddha's wisdom... don't directly break and abandon Two-Vehicle fruit... **Such power and function no other sūtra has; this sūtra has it completely**."

純顯佛之微妙智慧；不開眾生九法界知見，純開眾生佛之知見。

> "**Purely reveals Buddha's subtle wisdom**; doesn't open beings' nine-dharma-realm knowledge-and-vision—**purely opens beings' Buddha knowledge-and-vision**."

## Connection to Four Siddhāntas

結成悉檀者，權實二智，十用不同，即是一音演說，隨類各解。

> "**Concluding with Siddhāntas**: Expedient-real two wisdoms, ten uses different—this is **one voice teaching, each type understanding according to its kind**."

| Siddhānta | Trace Uses | Fundamental Uses |
|-----------|------------|------------------|
| **World** (世界) | Abiding in 3+1, using 3 | Abiding in trace/fundamental |
| **Person** (為人) | Opening, meeting, abiding in 3 | Opening, meeting trace |
| **Cure** (對治) | Breaking, abandoning, covering | Breaking, abandoning trace |
| **Ultimate** (第一義) | Abiding in 1, neither-3-nor-1 | Abiding in fundamental, neither |

---

## The Unique Power of This Sūtra

此經開權顯實，四悉檀大用最為雄猛。發迹顯本，四悉檀永異眾經。

> "This sūtra's **opening expedient, revealing real**—Four Siddhāntas' great function is **most heroic and fierce**. **Revealing trace, manifesting fundamental**—Four Siddhāntas **eternally different from all other sūtras**."

迹中力用，已出諸教；本中十用，諸經無一！

> "The Trace's power and function **already surpasses all teachings**; the Fundamental's ten uses—**no other sūtra has even one**, let alone ten!"

---

## Footnotes

[^1]: The **Essence (宗)** chapter establishes that the *Lotus Sūtra*'s aim is **One-Vehicle cause-and-fruit**, divided into the Trace Gate (cause-primary) and Fundamental Gate (fruit-primary).

[^2]: The **Function (用)** chapter identifies the sūtra's unique power as **breaking doubt and generating faith** (斷疑生信), accomplished through twenty applications—ten for each gate.
