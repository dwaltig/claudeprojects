# The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra

## Fascicle 10: Teaching Classification — Five Periods and Eight Teachings

**Scholarly Translation by The Architect**

---

### The Fifth Chapter: Teaching Classification

"If promoting other sūtras, **not clarifying teaching-classification causes no harm**; if promoting the *Lotus Sūtra*, **not clarifying teaching-classification leaves the text-and-meaning incomplete**."

Master Zhiyi frames teaching-classification in **five parts**:
1. Overall meaning
2. Differing interpretations
3. Difficulties and refutations
4. What to accept/reject
5. Final classification

### Why Teaching Classification Is Essential for the Lotus

"This sūtra isn't like that—**all dharma-gate catalogs, great-and-small contemplation methods, Ten Powers, Fearlessnesses, various regulations—none are discussed**, because prior sūtras already explained them."

"It **only discusses the Tathāgata's original beginning of teaching-deployment**, the middle period's giving-and-withdrawing with gradual-and-sudden matching the time, **the Great Cause-and-Condition, and the ultimate conclusion**."

### The Three Great Structures

#### 1. Three Kinds of Teaching (Common South/North Scheme)

| Category | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Sudden** | Direct teaching without stages |
| **Gradual** | Sequential teaching through stages |
| **Indeterminate** | Neither fixed sudden nor gradual |

#### 2. Five Periods

The Buddha's teaching career divided into five periods, metaphorized by the Five Flavors of dairy:

| Period | Teaching | Flavor |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | *Avataṃsaka* — for high bodhisattvas | **Milk** |
| 2 | *Āgamas* — Tripiṭaka for Two Vehicles | **Curds** |
| 3 | *Vaipulya* — scolding small, praising great | **Fresh Butter** |
| 4 | *Prajñāpāramitā* — emptiness for all | **Clarified Butter** |
| 5 | *Lotus* and *Nirvāṇa* — ultimate | **Ghee** |

#### 3. Four Teachings (Doctrinal)

| Teaching | Characteristic |
|---|---|
| **Tripiṭaka** | Analytical emptiness |
| **Shared** | Embodied emptiness |
| **Distinct** | Sequential Middle |
| **Perfect** | Immediate Middle |

### Critique of Other Schools

Master Zhiyi surveys **ten different teaching-classification systems** from the South and North, critiquing each:

#### Southern Schools
1. **Huqiu Mountain Master Ji** — Gradual teaching split into three: with-marks → without-marks → constant-abiding
2. **Zong'ai Master** — Gradual teaching split into four; adds “Converging Teaching” (Lotus: three return to one)
3. **Dinglin Rou / Second Two Masters / Daochang Guan** — Gradual teaching split into five; adds “Praise-and-Blame Teaching” (Vimalakīrti/Thought-Benefit) after no-sign, before converging

#### Northern Schools
4. **Northern Masters** — Five periods; *Tíwèi Bōlì* as Human-Heaven, Vimalakīrti + Prajñā as No-Sign
5. **Bodhiruci** — Half-Full Teaching
6. **Buddhabhadra / Scholar Guangtong** — Four Tenets (Cause-and-Condition, Provisional Names, Illusory Marks, Constant)
7. **Protecting-Body Master** — Five Tenets, adding the Dharma-Realm (Huayan)
8. **Qizhalin Master** — Six Tenets, adding True (Lotus) and Round (Daji)
9. **Northern Chan Masters** — Two Great Vehicles (with marks / without marks)
10. **Northern Chan Masters** — One Sound Teaching

### Zhiyi's Critique Summary

| Approach | What It Gets | What It Misses |
|---|---|---|
| **Five Flavors alone** | Expedient progression | Half/Full real intent |
| **Half/Full alone** | Real intent | Five-Flavors expedient ordering |
| **Four Tenets alone** | Doctrinal positions | Five-Flavors sequence |

---

### Difficulties and Refutations

Zhiyi refutes the competing systems in **their original progression**:

1. **South: Five‑Period scheme**  
   The “with‑marks / without‑marks” split fails because early sūtras already teach emptiness. The Deer‑Park phase is not purely “with marks,” and Prajñā is not uniquely “second.” The scheme also misplaces Lotus/Nirvāṇa and ignores explicit “earlier/later wheel” statements.

2. **South: Four‑Period scheme**  
   Placing “praise‑and‑blame” after Prajñā collapses distinct phases: the same rebukes appear earlier, and the logic of “after Prajñā” does not match the texts.

3. **South: Three‑Period scheme**  
   If everything from Prajñā through Lotus is “without marks,” then Lotus loses its distinct role of **opening the Three and returning to One**.

4. **North: Five‑Period scheme**  
   Treating the Tíwèi Bōlì text as purely “human/heaven” ignores its Mahāyāna scope and awakening results. It cannot be used as the first period without contradicting the record of the early compilation.

5. **Half/Full scheme (Bodhiruci)**  
   If “half” is only early and “full” only later, it contradicts texts that show full teaching from the beginning and cannot explain why Lotus is “secret” while Prajñā is not.

6. **Four Tenets (Buddhabhadra/Guangtong)**  
   The categories have weak scriptural support and blur distinct meanings; for example, they separate “Dharma‑Realm” from Nirvāṇa though the texts identify them.

7. **Five Tenets**  
   Adding “Dharma‑Realm” as a distinct highest category ignores other sūtras that already teach the Dharma‑Realm directly.

8. **Six Tenets**  
   Splitting “True” and “Round” forces contradictions: if “true” is not “constant,” it is unstable; if “constant” is not “true,” it is empty.

9. **Two Great Vehicles (with‑marks / without‑marks)**  
   A teaching cannot be only “with marks” (no truth) or only “without marks” (no teaching). Both sides must be held together.

10. **One‑Sound Teaching**  
    It erases the Buddha’s skillful means. The Lotus shows that one sound is **interpreted diversely**, not that one teaching abolishes all distinctions.

In each case, the system either **ignores explicit textual evidence** or **fails to account for expedient means**, so it cannot serve as a reliable classification.

---

### What to Accept and Reject

Zhiyi keeps what is **supported by both scripture and logic**, and discards what is not.

Accept:
- **Five Flavors** as a valid expedient progression **when paired** with Half/Full.
- **Half/Full** as the real intent **when paired** with Five Flavors.
- **Four Teachings** as a doctrinal map **when aligned** with the Five Flavors.

Reject:
- Any scheme that **replaces** the Lotus with another teaching.  
- Any scheme that **erases expedients** or **collapses distinctions** without textual support.  
- Any scheme that **privileges one gate** while ignoring the other three.

### The Correct Teaching Classification

#### The Three Proofs

Master Zhiyi establishes his system with **three textual proofs**:

| Proof | Text | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Skillful Means + Intro** | Sudden first, then gradual (present and past Buddhas) |
| 2 | **Sūtra of Immeasurable Meanings** | Sequence: Four Truths → Twelve Links → Vaipulya → Prajñā |
| 3 | **Trust-and-Understanding** | Four voice-hearers’ parable mirrors the five flavors |

---

### Five Flavors and Half-Full Combined

"If discussing Five Flavors alone, it's like Southern masters—only gets expedient. If discussing Half-Full alone, it's like Northern masters—only gets real. **Now I clarify: Five Flavors don't depart from Half-Full; Half-Full doesn't depart from Five Flavors.**"

| Period | Flavor | Half/Full |
|---|---|---|
| **Huayan** | Milk | Full only |
| **Āgama** | Curds | Half only |
| **Vaipulya** | Fresh Butter | Half-Full opposed |
| **Prajñā** | Clarified Butter | Carrying half, discussing full |
| **Lotus** | Ghee | Abandoning half, clarifying full |

Zhiyi’s core logic:
- **Huayan**: Full only—direct One Reality; no need for expedients
- **Āgamas**: Half only—expedient for small, guest workers
- **Vaipulya**: Half and Full in tension—full rebukes half
- **Prajñā**: Carrying half while discussing full—three vehicles within emptiness
- **Lotus**: Abandoning half, clarifying full—opening Buddha knowledge-and-vision

He adds: if there were no half, there would be no path to full; the full depends on earlier expedients to mature beings.

### Opening and Combining

"**Opening one from one**: In the Buddha-lands of ten directions, there is only One-Vehicle Dharma. When beings do not understand, it is opened into four—Perfect, Distinct, Shared, Tripiṭaka—then returned to One."

Zhiyi also treats opening/combining by number:
- **Two**: Half/Full—opening full to half, then abandoning half to return to full
- **Three**: One Vehicle opened into three, then returned to one
- **Four**: Four teachings (or four gates) opened and recombined
- **Five**: Five flavors opened and recombined
- **Six–Eight**: Extended sets (six perfections/seven factors/eightfold path; four teachings + two vehicles + human/heaven; further combinations)

### Combining or Not Combining (Half/Full + Five Flavors)

- **Huayan**: not combined (no half present)
- **Āgamas**: not combined (half only)
- **Vaipulya**: not combined (half hears full, but does not enter it)
- **Prajñā**: combined in dharma (half practices are reinterpreted as Mahāyāna), not combined in person
- **Lotus**: fully combined—people and dharma both merge into One Vehicle
- **Nirvāṇa**: both combined and not combined—keeps expedients for later ages

### “Broad vs. Specific” Application

- **Specific**: each flavor has a fixed place in the sequence.
- **Broad**: each flavor can extend earlier and later (e.g., Prajñā is taught throughout).

### Increasing the Count

Zhiyi notes that teaching-classification can be expanded beyond five flavors and half/full, since beings’ capacities differ. He sketches sets from **one to eight**, including:
- One Vehicle opened into four teachings and returned to One
- Opening and combining by five flavors
- Opening and combining by six perfections, seven factors of awakening, and eightfold path

### The Master's Conclusion

"**The Master said**: With these five chapters, I've briefly discussed the Profound Meaning. This cannot express the subtlety beyond the text—it's merely a rough statement of what I hold in mind."

"I constantly regret that **words cannot fully express meaning**—how much more can records exhaust words!"

"If one can **seek the seven meanings, penetrate the Ten Subtleties, research the seven distinguishing Substances, and the remaining five linked in succession**, it will be like embroidery, **citing sūtras to confirm, sentence by sentence interlocking**..."

"**The path of perfect penetration is opened here! Universal illumination is illuminated here!**"
