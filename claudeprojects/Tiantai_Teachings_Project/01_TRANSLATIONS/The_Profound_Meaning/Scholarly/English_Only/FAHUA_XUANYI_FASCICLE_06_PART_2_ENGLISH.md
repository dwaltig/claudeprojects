## Fascicle 6 (Part 2): Supernatural Powers Subtlety (The Seventh Subtlety)

**Scholarly Translation by The Architect**

### Overview

**Why Supernatural Powers After Resonance?**

Previously we discussed stimulus-response—simply analyzing the marks of what can arise and what can be approached. Now we **directly discuss transformative function benefiting others**—these are the **Three Wheels of Inconceivable Transformation**: Body-wheel, Speech-wheel, and Other-mind-wheel.

### The Three Wheels

The *Universal Gateway Chapter* has only two texts but encompasses three meanings:
- "**Roaming in the Sahā world**" is the **Body-wheel**
- "**Expounding the Dharma for them**" is the **Speech-wheel**

Like seeing a large lotus and knowing the pond is deep—if one sees great Dharma-exposition, one knows wisdom is great. Hence **two wheels imply the Mind-wheel**.

### Six Types of Supernatural Powers

Now following the **six types**: heavenly-eye, heavenly-ear, other-mind-knowledge, past-life-knowledge, supernormal-body-transformation, and outflow-free powers.

**What Is "Supernatural"?**

All six are called "supernatural powers." The *Yingluo Jing* says: "**'Supernatural' means heavenly mind; 'powers' means wisdom-nature.**"
- **Heavenly mind** = natural mind
- **Wisdom-nature** = penetrating without obstruction

The *Abhidharma* also says: "When obstructions are penetrated and ignorance is removed, wisdom-nature arises." When **natural wisdom-nature corresponds with the six dharmas**, one can **transform freely**—hence called supernatural powers.

**Real Transformation vs. Illusion**

The *Śāstra* says: "**Magical arts are deceptive dharmas**—they work on grass and trees, deceiving human eyes, but things don't actually change." **Supernatural powers are not like this**—they really transform dharmas, making things actually change...

Like earth has the principle of becoming water; water has the principle of becoming earth. When gold or silver meets fire, they melt; when water meets cold, it freezes. Fire and cold are melting and freezing dharmas. **Freezing is real freezing; melting is real melting**—when one attains natural wisdom-nature, one can **truly transform freely** like this.

### Supernatural Powers Across Teachings

Supernatural powers differ across teachings:

| Teaching | Type of Powers | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **Ghosts/Spirits** | Karmic-retribution | Born with powers |
| **Humans** | Medicine-induced | Through herbs/alchemy |
| **Externalists** | Root-meditation | From fundamental dhyāna |
| **Tripiṭaka** | Abandonment-based | Through eight liberations |
| **Common** | Body-dharma-based | Through instant-emptiness wisdom |
| **Distinct** | Sequential | Pre-ground: five powers; ground-entry: true outflow-free |
| **Perfect** | Non-intentional | Middle-way powers arising naturally |

### Perfect Teaching Supernatural Powers

**Perfect Teaching powers**: According to this sūtra and the *Samantabhadra Contemplation*, the nose and tongue roots are counted among the six.

**All six roots are wisdom**—this is the meaning of mutual function.

Now we say the **powers of six roots do not arise from mundane dhyāna**—this is the **truth of the Middle**. The truth itself has penetration, **naturally accomplished without intentional effort**—hence called "neutral transformation-upon-transformation dhyāna."

**The Distinction of Perfect Powers**

Discussing their cultivation: **all condition the Reality-Mark as the constant-abiding principle**. The text says: "Attaining this constant eye-root purity." Since it says "constant," it refers to **originally-pure nature**; constant nature has no defilement.

"That one" refers to Buddha as self, to sentient beings as other. Sentient beings consider it impermanent; **for the Tathāgata it is constant**. "Diminished cultivation" means depending on dhyāna—called diminished cultivation. **Depending on Reality-Mark is undiminished cultivation**.

### Coarse and Subtle Powers

Tripiṭaka and Common Teaching sages... are all called **coarse**. Like a **painting**—exhausting thought and effort, ultimately not resembling the real—this is called coarse.

Like a **bright mirror reflecting form**—naturally resembling—this is called subtle. **Expedient supernatural powers are like a coarse painting; Middle-Way natural powers are like a pure mirror**—hence subtle.

### Supernatural Powers in the Five Flavors

| Flavor | Powers Usage |
|---|---|
| **Milk** (*Avataṃsaka*) | One coarse, one subtle |
| **Curds** (*Tripiṭaka*) | One coarse only |
| **Fresh Butter** (*Vaipulya*) | Three coarse, one subtle |
| **Clarified Butter** (*Prajñā*) | Two coarse, one subtle |
| **Ghee** (*Lotus Sūtra*) | **One subtle only** |

**This sūtra's supernatural powers, whether many or few, are solely for the one subtle.**

### Ten Auspicious Signs in the Opening Chapter

The *Introduction Chapter*'s ten auspicious signs **all express subtlety**:

| # | Sign | Represents |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | "Ground entirely purified" | **Realm Subtlety** |
| 2 | "Light emitted between brows" | **Wisdom Subtlety** |
| 3 | "Entering samādhi" | **Practice Subtlety** |
| 4 | "Heaven raining four flowers" | **Position Subtlety** |
| 5 | "Sandalwood fragrant wind" | **Vehicle Subtlety** |
| 6 | "Four assemblies all had doubt" + "Seeing 18,000 lands" | **Resonance Subtlety (Readiness/Response)** |
| 7 | "Ground shaking six ways" | **Supernatural Powers Subtlety** |
| 8 | "Heavenly drum self-sounding" + "Dharma expounded" | **Dharma-exposition Subtlety** |
| 9 | "Dragons/gods greatly rejoicing" | **Retinue Subtlety** |
| 10 | "Seeing Buddha-children cultivating various practices" | **Benefits Subtlety** |

The text says: "Now the Buddha enters samādhi—this is inconceivable! Manifesting rare events!" **Manifesting rare events is subtle supernatural powers.**

### Opening Coarse to Reveal Subtle

**This sūtra not only has subtle as subtle, but also has no more coarse.** All previous coarseness is thoroughly clarified—becoming the **one equal great-wisdom subtle dharma-gate**.

**Only the one great Buddha-matter cause-and-condition**—never any other matter. Even seemingly matching nine-realm supernatural powers: sentient beings consider them other matters; **for Buddha, they are always Buddha-matters**. The guest-laborer considers himself lowly; the elder truly knows he is his son.

## Footnotes

[^1]: The **Three Wheels** of transformation—body, speech, and mind—represent the Buddha's three modes of teaching. The wheel metaphor suggests constant turning/activity and the ability to crush obstacles. Master Zhiyi emphasizes that subtle supernatural powers arise naturally from Middle-Way realization, unlike the intentional effort required for coarse powers.
