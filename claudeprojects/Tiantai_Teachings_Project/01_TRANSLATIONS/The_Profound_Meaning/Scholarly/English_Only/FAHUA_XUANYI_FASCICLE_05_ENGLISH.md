# The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra

## Fascicle 5: Three Dharmas Subtlety (The Fifth Subtlety)

**Scholarly Translation by The Architect**

---

### Overview

**This is the dharma in which the subtle positions abide.** The term "Three Dharmas" means the **Three Tracks**. "Track" means pattern or standard—these three dharmas can serve as patterns.

This has **seven topics**:
1. General explanation of the Three Tracks
2. Specific explanation of the Three Tracks
3. Judging coarse and subtle
4. Opening coarse to reveal subtle
5. Explaining beginning and end
6. Classifying the Three Dharmas
7. Four Siddhānta analysis

#### Ten Intentions Clarifying the Perfect Position

The Chinese text begins by framing the "Most Real Position" through **ten intentions**:

1.  **Simple naming meaning**: the name already carries the perfect sense.
2.  **Number of positions**: even with many enumerated stages, the equality of the principle remains.
3.  **Cutting and subduing**: how the teaching uproots afflictions.
4.  **Function**: what benefits each capacity.
5.  **Coarse versus subtle**: when provisional displays give way to the wondrous.
6.  **Arising of positions**: why different structures appear to match each listener.
7.  **Passing away of positions**: how provisional forms fade once the real is revealed.
8.  **Opening coarse to reveal subtle**: the pedagogy of progressively unveiling the subtle.
9.  **Scriptural citations**: pointing back to prior teachings.
10. **The beginning-and-end of the wondrous position**: the perfect teaching’s wholeness from first entry to final state.

These intentions frame the rest of the fascicle, even as we now dive into the Three Tracks themselves.

### 1. General Explanation of the Three Tracks

1.  **True Nature Track**
2.  **Contemplative Illumination Track**
3.  **Resource Accomplishment Track**

Though the names are three, **they are only the one Great Vehicle dharma**.

#### The Three Names for the One Vehicle

The sūtra says: "Seeking in the ten directions, there is no other vehicle—**only the One Buddha Vehicle**." The One Buddha Vehicle contains these three dharmas:
*   Also named **Ultimate Truth**
*   Also named **Ultimate Emptiness**
*   Also named **Tathāgatagarbha**

#### Not Three, Not One

**These three are not definitely three**—discussing three, we speak of one. **One is not definitely one**—discussing one, we speak of three. Inconceivable, neither parallel nor separate—like the **three dots of the *i* character** or the **heavenly eye**.

Hence the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "Buddha-nature is '**also one, non-one, neither-one-nor-non-one**.'
*   'Also one' means all sentient beings are entirely One Vehicle"—this refers to **Ultimate Truth**.
*   "'Non-one' means such enumerable dharmas"—this refers to **Tathāgatagarbha**.
*   "'Neither-one-nor-non-one' means enumerable and non-enumerable dharmas are not fixed"—this refers to **Ultimate Emptiness**.

#### Correspondence with Previous Subtleties

**Previous discussions of all truths—opening or closing, coarse or subtle—are already the mark of the True Nature Track.**
**Previous discussions of all wisdoms—opening or closing, coarse or subtle—are the mark of the Contemplative Illumination Track.**
**Previous discussions of all practices—opening or closing, coarse or subtle—are already the mark of the Resource Accomplishment Track.**

**Previous discussions of all positions are simply the fruits attained from cultivating these three dharmas.**

### 2. The Perfect Teaching's Three Dharmas

**Taking the True Nature Track as the vehicle-body.** "Not false" is called "true"; "not changing" is called "nature." This is the **constant-abiding right cause**—what all Buddhas take as teacher—this is that dharma.

All sentient beings are also entirely One Vehicle. **Sentient beings are precisely the mark of Nirvāṇa**—there is nothing more to extinguish. **Nirvāṇa is precisely birth-and-death**—no extinction, no arising.

Hence the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā* says: "**This vehicle neither moves nor exits.**" This is that vehicle.

#### Contemplative Illumination Track

**Contemplative Illumination**: simply pointing to true nature, quiescent yet constantly illuminating—this is Contemplative Illumination, which is **Ultimate Emptiness**.

#### Resource Accomplishment Track

**Resource Accomplishment**: simply pointing to the true-nature Dharma-realm, containing and storing all practices, immeasurable implements—this is **Tathāgatagarbha**.

#### The Wish-Fulfilling Jewel

**The three dharmas are neither one nor different.** Like pointing to a wish-fulfilling jewel and discussing its light and treasure—light and treasure are not one with the jewel, not different from the jewel, **not vertical, not horizontal**. The three dharmas are also thus: also one, also non-one, also neither-one-nor-non-one—**inconceivable three dharmas**.

#### The Three Obstacles

**If one is confused about these three dharmas, they become the three obstacles:**

| Dharma Confused | Obstacle | What It Blocks |
|---|---|---|
| Tathāgatagarbha | Dust-and-sand | Innumerable dharma-gates |
| Ultimate Emptiness | View-and-thought | Liberation |
| Ultimate Truth | Root Ignorance | Buddha-nature realization |

#### Revealing the Three Dharmas

If through dust-and-sand obstacles one comprehends innumerable dharma-gates—**Resource Accomplishment Track is revealed**.
If through view-and-thought obstacles one comprehends Ultimate Emptiness—**Contemplative Illumination Track is revealed**.
If through root ignorance obstacle one comprehends Ultimate Truth—**True Nature Track is revealed**.

**True Nature Track revealed is called Dharma-body.**
**Contemplative Illumination revealed is called Prajñā.**
**Resource Accomplishment revealed is called Liberation.**

These two are concentration-and-wisdom adornments, adorning the Dharma-body. **Dharma-body is the vehicle-body; concentration-and-wisdom are the implements.**

### 3. Classifying the Three Dharmas

Classifying and penetrating the Three Dharmas... What are they? **Meeting conditions, names differ; grasping the meaning, the significance is the same.** Roughly penetrating ten categories, the rest can be understood.

#### The Ten Three-Dharmas

| # | Category | True Nature | Contemplative Illumination | Resource Accomplishment |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Three Paths** | Suffering Path | Affliction Path | Karma Path |
| 2 | **Three Consciousnesses** | Amala | Ālaya | Ādāna |
| 3 | **Three Buddha-Natures** | Right Cause | Understanding Cause | Condition Cause |
| 4 | **Three Prajñās** | Reality-Mark | Contemplative | Literary |
| 5 | **Three Bodhis** | Reality-Mark | Real-wisdom | Skillful-means |
| 6 | **Three Great Vehicles** | Principle Vehicle | Following Vehicle | Attainment Vehicle |
| 7 | **Three Bodies** | Dharma-body | Reward-body | Response-body |
| 8 | **Three Nirvāṇas** | Nature-Purity | Perfect-Purity | Skillful-Purity |
| 9 | **One-Essence Three Jewels** | Dharma | Buddha | Sangha |
| 10 | **Three Virtues** | Dharma-body | Prajñā | Liberation |

This list follows the CBETA sequence from **paths and consciousnesses** through **buddha‑natures, prajñās, bodhis, vehicles, bodies, nirvāṇas, jewels, and virtues**.

#### Type-Penetrating the Three Paths

The Three Paths are the Three Tracks. **Suffering Path is True Nature**: the text below says "worldly marks are eternally abiding"—is not birth-and-death precisely Dharma-body?

**Affliction is Contemplative Illumination**: contemplative illumination fundamentally illuminates delusion; without delusion, there is no illumination... thus affliction is contemplative illumination.

**Resource Accomplishment is Karma Path**: evil is the resource for good; without evil, there is no good either.

#### Type-Penetrating the Three Buddha-Natures

**Three Buddha-Natures**: True Nature Track is **Right-Cause Nature**; Contemplative Illumination Track is **Understanding-Cause Nature**; Resource Accomplishment Track is **Condition-Cause Nature**.

Hence the text below says: "**You are truly my children; I am truly your father**"—this is Right-Cause Nature.

Also: "Because I formerly taught you the unsurpassed path, **your all-knowledge vow still remains, not lost**." Wisdom is Understanding-Cause Nature; vow is Condition-Cause Nature.

#### Type-Penetrating the Three Virtues

Type-penetrating the **Three Virtues**: The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*'s Three Virtues together complete Great Nirvāṇa. This sūtra's Three Tracks together complete the Great Vehicle.

That [sūtra] clarifies Dharma-body virtue; this says Reality-Mark. That clarifies Prajñā virtue; this sūtra clarifies that the wisdom-gate is difficult to understand, difficult to enter. That sūtra clarifies Liberation virtue; this sūtra clarifies repeated manifestation...

### 4. Judging Coarse and Subtle

The *Fahua Xuanyi* now re‑reads the previous enumerations—truths, wisdoms, practices, positions—as both coarse expressions and subtle truths. What was coarse is coarse only in appearance; the same lists, when seen through the three tracks, become subtle. **The True Nature Track is the principle side**, the **Contemplative Illumination Track is the name/interpretation side**, and the **Resource Accomplishment Track is the practice/result side**. All three contain both coarse and subtle meanings, so the distinctions between the vehicles, dharma names, and stages collapse into the interpenetration of the three tracks.

Zhiyi reinforces this by invoking the four Siddhāntas. The **Worldly Siddhānta** represents surface‑level doctrines that can be broken apart and rebuilt (coarse). The **For-Each-Person Siddhānta** and the **Therapeutic Siddhānta** both employ temporary, goal‑oriented devices to cut delusion—they still belong to the coarse, provisional level, because their “machine” and “response” are contingent and thus “breakable.” Only the **First Principle Siddhānta**, which points directly at Ultimate Truth and does not lend itself to being split apart, counts as subtle. This matches the CBETA commentary’s insistence that the “three coarse siddhāntas” are worldly constructions while the First Principle is unbreakable, and only when every Siddhānta is shown to contain the First Principle does the Perfect Teaching move beyond coarse scaffolding to subtle unity.

This judging process is not meant to reject the earlier teachings, but to arrange them: the ten suchnesses, the three paths, the ten bodhisattva virtues, and so on are the coarse scaffolding that the Perfect Teaching uses to display the subtle, non‑dual intelligence of the three tracks.

### 5. Opening the Coarse to Reveal the Subtle

Having judged coarse and subtle, the text emphasizes **opening the coarse (provisional presentations) so that the subtle (the One Vehicle) can appear**. This is the very tactic of the Perfect Teaching: it allows diverse names and positions to remain in place while revealing that they all participate in the same three dharmas. The names, the practices, the vows—whether listed as the three vehicles, three wisdoms, or ten stages—are opened so that the subtle unity and the original mind shine through. The coarse (expedient formulas) becomes the vehicle for the subtle (the inseparable three tracks).

### 6. Explaining Beginning and End

The Perfect Teaching begins with the ordinary mind that already contains the ten suchnesses: **ten kinds of characteristics (the ten suchnesses themselves) belong to the three tracks**; when a being with afflictive tendencies awakens, these characteristics reveal the True Nature Track, the Contemplative Illumination Track, and the Resource Accomplishment Track simultaneously. Beginning and end are therefore not two separate poles but the same continuity: the first arousing of the mind is already a complete set of Dharma-vehicles, and the final fruition simply manifests what was always present. The tenfold ordering (five tiers of seeds, ten hearts, six powers, etc.) shows how the three tracks unfold from beginning to end without abandoning their shared principle, name, and practice aspects.

### 7. Four Siddhānta Analysis

Zhiyi next turns to the **Four Siddhāntas (four discernments)**—Worldly, For-Each-Person, Therapeutic, and First Principle—as a final lens through which to view the three tracks. Each Siddhānta addresses a different readiness–and response–but **all four already participate in the three tracks**. The Worldly Siddhānta (laukika) offers the broad “worldly” patterns that introduce beginners to Dharma; the For-Each-Person Siddhānta (prātipauruṣika) customizes the teaching to individual agents; the Therapeutic Siddhānta (prātipākṣika) cuts through afflictions by responding with appropriate remedies; the First Principle Siddhānta (paramārtha) directly points to Ultimate Truth without being broken, so it is the “subtle” end of the spectrum. The CBETA commentary confirms that Zhiyi means to place all four side by side—he describes the three coarse siddhāntas as being “breakable” and subject to provisional teachings, whereas the First Principle is “unbreakable” and therefore properly “wonderful.” The Perfect Teaching keeps every siddhānta, but it also shows that once you see each through the unifying lens of the true principle, they all reveal the same three dharmas: world, wisdom, and practice inter-penetrate from coarse to subtle, and the “four benefits” (worldly/individual/therapeutic/prime) are different slices of that same dharma treasury.

## Footnotes

[^1]: The **Three Tracks** represent Master Zhiyi's synthesis of the entire Buddha-dharma into three interpenetrating aspects. They correspond to: the reality that is realized (True Nature), the wisdom that realizes (Contemplative Illumination), and the practice that enables realization (Resource Accomplishment). These three are neither one nor different—like the light and treasure of a wish-fulfilling jewel.
