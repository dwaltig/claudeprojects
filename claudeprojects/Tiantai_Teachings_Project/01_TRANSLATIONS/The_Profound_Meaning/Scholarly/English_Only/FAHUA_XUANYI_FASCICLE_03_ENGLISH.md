### Part 1: Wisdom Subtlety (The Second Subtlety)

**Ultimate principle is profound and subtle—without wisdom, it cannot be revealed. Wisdom knows what is to be known—without realm, there is no fusion.** The realm being fused and subtle, wisdom also accords with it, just as shadow follows form. Therefore after Realm, we explain Wisdom.

#### Overview of the Six Topics

Wisdom has two parts: (1) General discussion of the wisdoms, (2) Wisdom discussed in relation to realm. The general discussion has six topics: (1) **Number**, (2) **Classification**, (3) **Characteristics**, (4) **Illumination**, (5) **Judgment**, (6) **Opening**.

#### 1. The Number: The Twenty Wisdoms

**The Twenty Wisdoms are:**

| # | Wisdom | Teaching |
|---|--------|----------|
| 1 | **World Wisdom** | Mundane |
| 2 | **Five Stilling-Hearts & Four Mindfulnesses** | Tripiṭaka |
| 3 | **Four Roots-of-Good** | Tripiṭaka |
| 4 | **Four Fruits** | Tripiṭaka |
| 5 | **Pratyekabuddha Wisdom** | Tripiṭaka |
| 6 | **Six Perfections** | Tripiṭaka |
| 7 | **Tripiṭaka Śrāvaka Body-Dharma** | Shared |
| 8 | **Shared Pratyekabuddha** | Shared |
| 9 | **Shared Bodhisattva Entry-True Expedient** | Shared |
| 10 | **Shared Bodhisattva Exit-Provisional** | Shared |
| 11 | **Distinct Ten Faiths** | Distinct |
| 12 | **Distinct Thirty Minds** | Distinct |
| 13 | **Distinct Ten Grounds** | Distinct |
| 14 | **Tripiṭaka Buddha Wisdom** | Tripiṭaka |
| 15 | **Shared Teaching Buddha Wisdom** | Shared |
| 16 | **Distinct Teaching Buddha Wisdom** | Distinct |
| 17 | **Perfect Five Grades of Disciples** | Perfect |
| 18 | **Six Roots Purified** | Perfect |
| 19 | **First Abiding to Equal Awakening** | Perfect |
| 20 | **Wondrous Awakening** | Perfect |

This list follows the CBETA order: **worldly → Tripiṭaka → Shared → Distinct → Perfect**, moving from common wisdom to the fully realized Buddha wisdom.

#### 2. Classification by Group

**World Wisdom** has no Buddhist path—wrong views and false attachments, mental activity outside principle, not believing, not entering. Hence it is one category.

**Five Stilling-Hearts and Four Mindfulnesses**: having entered the initial stage of worthy Buddha-dharma, both are outer-ordinary. Hence one.

**Four Roots-of-Good**: all are inner-ordinary. Hence one.

**Four Fruits**: all see truth. Hence one.

**Pratyekabuddha**: separate-aspect contemplation can encroach on habitual tendencies. Hence one.

**Six Perfections**: wisdom conditioning principle is weak; wisdom conditioning phenomena is strong. Hence one.

**Shared Śrāvaka Body-Dharma Wisdom** is superior to Tripiṭaka. Hence one. **Shared Pratyekabuddha** is slightly superior again. Hence one.

**Shared Bodhisattva Entry-True**: learns all four gates. Hence one. **Shared Exit-Provisional**: properly conditions the conventional. Hence one.

**Distinct Ten Faiths**: first knows the Middle, superior to former, inferior to later. Hence one. **Distinct Thirty Minds**: all inner-ordinary. Hence one. **Ten Grounds**: all sage-wisdom. Hence one.

**Tripiṭaka Buddha**: the teacher position, superior to three-vehicle disciples. Hence one. **Shared Buddha**: cutting delusion and illuminating readiness is superior. Hence one. **Distinct Buddha**: yet superior. Hence one.

**Perfect Five Grades**: all possess the nature of afflictions yet can know the Tathāgata's secret treasury. Hence one. **Six Roots Purified**: neighbors the true. Hence one. **First Abiding to Equal Awakening**: all break ignorance. Hence one. **Wondrous Awakening Buddha Wisdom**: unsurpassed, most honored. Hence one.

Thus classifying by type those that are similar—whether separating or combining—**we judge them as twenty**.

#### 3. Distinguishing Characteristics

**World Wisdom**

In India, world wisdom reaches at most "neither-perception-nor-non-perception." What is valued here in China lies in loyalty and filial piety, the five elements, the six arts, astronomy, geography, medicine, divination, military strategy, commerce—knowing a thousand kinds of plants, naming ten thousand kinds of animals.

Also achieving impartiality like painting left and cutting right without hatred or love. Attaining root concentration, developing the five supernatural powers—stopping rivers in the ear, transforming Indra into a sheep, breathing in and out wind and clouds, touching sun and moon.

The dharmas are worldly dharmas; the concentration is immovable concentration; the wisdom is exiting from immovability. **Seeking fame and profit, increasing views and craving—known by the worldly mind—hence called World Wisdom.**

**Four Roots-of-Good**

*   **Warmth:** Conditioning the realm of four truths, wisdom arises, subduing afflictions; wisdom further increases, becoming the sixteen contemplation-wisdoms. It is like a fire-drill—above and below depending on each other, generating fire to burn fuel. **With wisdom knowing realm, one can generate warmth-wisdom, causing the fuel of existence to wither.** Venerable Ghoṣa said: "Seeking the wisdom-fire of liberation, warmth is at the beginning. Like fire, having smoke at the beginning as its mark—the fire of outflow-free wisdom also has warmth-dharma at the beginning as its mark."
*   **Summit:** Form-realm wholesome roots—movable and immovable, abiding and not abiding, with difficulty and without difficulty, cut and not cut, regressing and not regressing. Among those movable through regressing, there are two: lower is warmth, upper is summit. Among those immovable through non-regressing, there are two: lower is patience, upper is **World-First Dharma**. **It is like a path on a mountain summit—people do not stay long.** Without difficulty, they necessarily cross to the other side; encountering difficulty, they then retreat.
*   **Patience:** Correctly contemplating the suffering of the desire realm, form and formless realms... Thus thirty-two minds—this is called **lower patience**. Later, the practitioner gradually reduces practices and conditions... this is called **middle patience**. Then with one mind contemplating desire-realm suffering—this is called **upper patience**.
*   **World-First Dharma:** This mind and mental factors, compared to other dharmas, are the most, the superior, the chief, the honored, the uppermost, the subtle. The meaning of "most superior" is "ultimate meaning." Attaining the subtle fruit is ultimate meaning—**like the top of a high banner, with nothing higher—this is ultimate meaning.**

#### 4. Illumination (Four Wisdoms Illuminating Dependent Origination)

**Twenty Wisdoms illuminating the four types of Twelve Links:**

1.  World wisdom; Five Stillings and Four Mindfulnesses; Four Roots-of-Good; Four Fruits; Pratyekabuddha; Six Perfections; Tripiṭaka Buddha—**seven wisdoms in total illuminate the Conceivable Arising-and-Ceasing Twelve Links**.
2.  Shared Śrāvaka Body-Dharma wisdom, Shared Pratyekabuddha wisdom, Shared Bodhisattva Entry-True Expedient wisdom, Shared Bodhisattva Exit-Provisional wisdom, Shared Buddha wisdom—**five wisdoms illuminate the Conceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing Twelve Links**.
3.  Distinct Teaching's Ten Faiths, Thirty Minds, Ten Grounds, Buddha—**four wisdoms illuminate the Inconceivable Arising-and-Ceasing Twelve Links**.
4.  Perfect Teaching's **four wisdoms illuminate the Inconceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing Twelve Links**.

#### 5. Judging Coarse and Subtle

**Judging coarse and subtle:** The former twelve types of wisdom are coarse; the latter eight types are subtle.

Why? Tripiṭaka and Shared Buddhas are themselves impermanent and do not teach permanence—how could their Two Vehicle and bodhisattva disciples hear, believe in, or cultivate permanence? **Hence coarse.**

**Distinct Teaching Ten Faiths have already heard permanence from the beginning**—believing and cultivating permanence—still surpass those Tripiṭaka/Shared Buddhas. How much more the rest! **Hence subtle.**

**Distinct Teaching: Three Coarse, One Subtle**

Also, Distinct Teaching's four wisdoms: **three coarse, one subtle**.

The *Dilun* school says: "The Middle is revealed only at the fruit-stage. Beginners look up and believe in this principle **like hanging a mountain by a lotus fiber.**"

Hence they say faith and practice are not Perfect intention. Hence **Ten Faiths wisdom is coarse**. Ten Abidings primarily cultivate emptiness, secondarily cultivate provisional and middle. Ten Practices primarily cultivate provisional, secondarily middle. Ten Dedications begin primarily cultivating middle. But this middle is only principle, **not containing all dharmas—hence all coarse**.

**Ground-attaining wisdom breaks ignorance, sees the Middle—realization is subtle.**

**Perfect Teaching: All Four Subtle**

**Perfect Teaching's four wisdoms are all subtle:** As the dharma-mark is spoken, so one believes; as principle is, so one practices. Beginning with the Five Grades, ending with Wondrous Awakening—**real and not expedient—hence all subtle.** This is explaining subtle wisdom by contrasting coarse wisdom.

#### 6. Opening the Coarse to Reveal the Subtle

**Opening the coarse to reveal the subtle:** The former sixteen types of wisdom—if not decisively clarified, they are only coarse wisdom. If decisively clarified, **all become subtle wisdom**.

Why? Like King Wonderful Adornment—formerly possessing non-Buddhist world wisdom, upon hearing the *Lotus Sūtra* he immediately attained decisive clarity. **With wrong marks entering right marks, without moving among all views he cultivated the thirty-seven factors of awakening; not abandoning the eight wrongs, he entered the eight rights.** This is deciding world wisdom and entering subtle wisdom.

**All sixteen coarse wisdoms become subtle wisdom. With no coarse to contrast, this is Absolute Wisdom Subtlety.**

### Part 2: Practice Subtlety (The Third Subtlety)

#### The Relationship of Wisdom and Practice

This has two parts: (1) **Shared-path increasing-number practices**, (2) **Teaching-specific increasing-number practices**.

**Practice means advancing forward—without wisdom, there is no progress.** Wisdom-understanding guides practice—without realm, practice is not correct. **Wisdom is the eyes; practice is the feet—together they arrive at the clear cool pond.**[^1]

Understanding is the root of practice; practice can complete wisdom—hence when practice is full, wisdom is perfected. Wisdom can reveal principle; when principle is exhausted, wisdom ceases.

**Such mutual dependence is not yet subtle practice. Subtle practice means: one practice is all practices.**

**Scriptural Evidence**

As the sūtra says: "Originally from numberless Buddhas, completely practicing all paths." Also: "At the places of immeasurable Buddhas, practicing the deep and subtle path." Also: "Exhaustively practicing all the path-dharmas of all Buddhas."

Having "complete," moreover "deep," and also "exhaustive": **Complete means broad; deep means high; exhaustive means ultimate.**

**The Threefold Unity**

This subtle practice, together with the former realm and wisdom, **is one discussed as three, three discussed as one**.

Former realm was explained as dharma-marks; dharma-marks also contain three, called the secret treasury. Former wisdom is understanding of dharma-marks; understanding also contains three, like three eyes on a face. **Present practice is what is practiced**; practicing as taught, it also contains three, called the **three dots of the *i* character**.

**Whether three or one, there is no deficiency—hence called subtle practice.**

#### 1. Shared-Path Increasing-Number Practices

The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* says: "When bodhisattvas practice *prajñā*, **with one dharma as practice, they encompass all practices**; or with immeasurable one-dharmas as practice, they encompass all practices. With two dharmas as practice, they encompass all practices... up to ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, a hundred million dharmas as practice—they encompass all practices."

**Though practices are many, wisdom is the root.** Wisdom is like a guide-leader; practice is like merchants. **Wisdom is like a sharp needle; practice is like a long thread.** Wisdom drives the ox of practice; the cart is then stable and can arrive at its destination.

#### 2. Teaching-Specific Increasing-Number Practices

**Tripiṭaka Teaching**

*   **One Practice**: In the *Āgamas*, the Buddha told the monks: "You should cultivate **one practice**—I guarantee you the four śramaṇa fruits—namely, **the mind not being heedless**. If you can guard the mind with non-heedless practice, broadly expounding and spreading it, then what is to be done is accomplished and you can attain Nirvāṇa."
*   **Two Practices**: The *Āgamas* say: "Forest-dwelling monks should cultivate **two dharmas** as practice: cultivating **cessation** (*śamatha*) and cultivating **insight** (*vipaśyanā*)." When cultivating cessation, one can rest all evil... When cultivating insight, one can contemplate suffering... The Tathāgata also cultivated thus.
*   **Three Practices**: **Discipline, concentration, wisdom**—these three are the ladder out of the world, the standard pattern of Buddha-dharma. The *Prātimokṣa* says: "**All evils not to be done; all goods to be practiced; self-purify one's mind—this is the teaching of all Buddhas.**" Buddha-dharma is a vast ocean; these three encompass it all.

**Shared Teaching**

Not fixing texts to determine the Shared Teaching, we simply take the dharma-gates studied in common by the three vehicles and point to this as "Shared."

The *Treatise* says: "When bodhisattvas practice *prajñā*, **though knowing all dharmas as one-mark, they can also know all dharmas' various marks; though knowing all dharmas' various marks, they can also know all dharmas as one-mark.**"

How does one contemplate all dharmas as one-mark? Namely, contemplating all dharmas as no-mark... **This is contemplating all dharmas as one-mark; one-mark is no-mark.**

**Distinct Teaching**

Distinct Teaching's increasing-number practices: Like Sudhana entering the Dharma-Realm, at each good teacher's place he heard one dharma as practice... up to 110 good teachers, each dharma-gate being thus. **Each and every practice breaks ignorance, entering deep realms.**

**Perfect Teaching**

Perfect Teaching's increasing-number practices: As the *Mañjuśrī-paripṛcchā Sūtra* clarifies—bodhisattvas cultivating the **One-Practice Samādhi**: in a quiet room, sitting cross-legged, **binding conditions to the Dharma-Realm, one-thought being the Dharma-Realm, all ignorance and confusion eternally quiescent like space**.

**This one practice is precisely the unobstructed person of all dharmas, the one path exiting birth-and-death.** Among all dharmas, entering through equal contemplation—the mind of liberating wisdom is silent and still, within the three realms without peer. **This is one practice encompassing all practices.**

Increasing by ten as practice, encompassing all practices: the **ten realms**, or the **ten contemplations completing the vehicle**, etc. Increasing by hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, a hundred million, asaṃkhya, unspeakable dharma-gates as practice—how could we exhaustively record them? **If one gets the meaning, by example one can understand.**

#### Coarse and Subtle Judgment

In increasing-number practices, practices being different, we must judge coarse and subtle.

*   **Tripiṭaka increasing-number practices**: guided by arising-and-ceasing wisdom, only expecting to exit suffering, resting at the Conjured City—**hence coarse**.
*   **Shared Teaching**: though body-wisdom is skillful, it only guides exiting suffering; ashes and extinction are the same result—**hence coarse**.
*   **Distinct Teaching**: wisdom-guidance is far-reaching, ascending from shallow to deep; but practices are separated, phenomena and principle not fused—**hence coarse**.
*   **Perfect Teaching increasing-number practices**: practice is fused, wisdom is complete—**hence subtle**.

#### Opening the Coarse to Reveal the Subtle

**Opening the coarse to discuss the subtle:** Lowering the head or raising the hand, piling earth or playing with sand—**all become the Buddha Path**. Though teaching various dharmas, actually it is for the One Vehicle. **All practices are subtle; there is no coarse to contrast—the contrast is severed.**

#### The Five Special Practices

Further, regarding the subtle practice of the five-number: two parts—first, Distinct five practices; next, Perfect five practices.

Distinct: as the *MahāpariNirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "**Five kinds of practice:** (1) **Sacred Practice**, (2) **Pure Practice**, (3) **Heavenly Practice**, (4) **Infant Practice**, (5) **Sick Practice**."

**Sacred Practice**

**Sacred Practice has three: discipline, concentration, wisdom.**

As the sūtra says: "If a bodhisattva hears the Great Nirvāṇa and after hearing generates faith, thinking thus: 'All Buddha World-Honored Ones have the unsurpassed path, have the great true dharma, have the great assembly's true practice'—from this, practice is established."

"Hearing the Great Nirvāṇa" is faith in the fruit, also faith in cessation. "Has the unsurpassed path" onward is faith in the practice revealing the fruit. "Unsurpassed path" is faith in wisdom; "great true dharma" is faith in concentration; "great assembly's true practice" is faith in discipline.

**The Ten Kinds of Discipline**

The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* also clarifies **ten kinds of discipline**:

1.  **Not-broken**: Root precepts intact
2.  **Not-deficient**: No missing aspects
3.  **Not-holed**: No subtle violations
4.  **Not-mixed**: Not polluted by wrong intentions
5.  **Following-the-Path**: Precepts of the path
6.  **Non-Attachment**: Precepts without grasping
7.  **Praised-by-the-Wise**: Praised by sages
8.  **Self-Mastery**: Free and unhindered
9.  **Following-Concentration**: Arising from samādhi
10. **Fully-Complete**: All pāramitās contained

#### Opening Coarse Precepts into Subtle

**Opening the coarse to reveal the subtle:** Others say: "The *Brahmajāla* is the bodhisattva precepts." We now ask: "Which kind of bodhisattva precepts?"

If understood as Distinct and Perfect bodhisattva precepts, acceptable. Why? Outside the three-vehicle community, there are separate bodhisattvas—hence separate precepts.

**Opening the coarse:** Those who study the Vinaya are precisely studying the Great Vehicle's *śikṣamāṇā*. *Śikṣamāṇā* is precisely the light of Great Vehicle ultimate meaning—neither blue, nor yellow, nor red, nor white. **The three refuges, five precepts, ten goods, 250 bhikṣu rules—all are Mahāyāna.** How could coarse precepts be separated from subtle precepts!

Precepts being precisely subtle, people are also thus. **"You are truly my children"**—this is that meaning. **This is called Absolute Subtle Precepts.**

## Footnotes

[^1]: The "**clear cool pond**" is a standard metaphor for Nirvāṇa or the Buddha-realm—refreshing liberation from the burning of afflictions.

[^2]: The "**three dots of the *i* character**" refers to the Sanskrit vowel *i* (इ), which in its traditional form has three elements arranged in a triangular pattern. This became a key Tiantai symbol for the three aspects (realm, wisdom, practice) being mutually containing and non-linear—not stacked vertically or spread horizontally, but interpenetrating.
