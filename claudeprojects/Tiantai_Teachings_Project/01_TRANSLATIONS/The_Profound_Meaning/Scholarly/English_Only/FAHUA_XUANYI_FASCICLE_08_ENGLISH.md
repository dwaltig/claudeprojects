# The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra

## Fascicle 8: The Generic Title ("Sūtra") and Substance

**Scholarly Translation by The Architect**

### Part One: The Generic Title — "Sūtra"

**Sūtra** has varying transliterations: *xiūduōluó*, *xiūdānlán*, or *xiūdùlù*—due to regional dialect differences.

Explaining this has **five sections**:
1. Why it cannot be translated
2. Why it can be translated
3. Harmonizing both views
4. Explaining "Sūtra" through dharmas
5. Explaining "Sūtra" through mind-contemplation

### 1. Five Meanings That Cannot Be Translated

The argument for **no translation**: That language has multiple meanings; this language is single and shallow—**cannot use single to translate multiple**.

The old teaching says: **"Sūtra" has five meanings**:
1.  **Dharma-Source**
2.  **Subtle Development**
3.  **Gushing Spring**
4.  **Plumb-line**
5.  **Flower Garland**

**Dharma-Source**: "What the golden mouth speaks with one word as source **flows out as immeasurable verbal teachings**."
**Practice-Source**: Shows people the non-contention dharma, guides through obstructions.
**Principle-Source**: Following one sentence expresses one meaning; following immeasurable sentences expresses immeasurable meanings.

**Subtle Development**: "Initially hearing worldly siddhānta, sequentially receiving and differentiating dharma-marks, **subtle understanding arises, gradually increasing**."

**Gushing Spring**: "Buddha using four siddhāntas to teach—**text and meaning are inexhaustible, dharma-flow is unceasing**."

**Plumb-Line**: "**Cutting the deviant teachings of craving and views**, not overturned by deviant winds."

**Flower Garland**: "**Threading together teaching, practice, and principle—like stringing a flower garland**, not allowing them to scatter."

### 2. Five Meanings That Can Be Translated

| # | Translation | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Jing (warp/through)** | "Passage through"—all passes through the sage's mind |
| 2 | **Contract (Accord)** | Fits conditions, fits events, fits principle |
| 3 | **Dharma-Source** | As above |
| 4 | **Thread** | Sews teaching, practice, principle together |
| 5 | **Good Teaching** | Teaching of good words, actions, principles |

### 3. Harmonizing Both

"Now **harmonizing translatable and untranslatable**, opening up the meaning."

"If equally untranslatable, why not mark it as 'subtle development' or 'gushing spring'? **Now correctly using 'Sūtra' because it is strongest among multiple meanings.**"

"[Sūtra] **contains three dharma-sources, three subtle developments, three gushing springs, all plumb-lines, flower garlands... all absorbed in the single character 'Sūtra'**."

#### Summary: Fifteen Meanings of "Sūtra"

Master Zhiyi expands the traditional five to **fifteen**:

> "The old teaching says Sūtra contains five meanings; **now I say Sūtra contains fifteen meanings**."

### Part Two: Substance — Reality-Mark

"**Substance** is the pointing-return of the whole text, the assembly of all meanings."

The text says: "**This dharma cannot be shown; the mark of verbal expression is quiescent**."

This has **seven topics**:
1. Directly revealing the Sūtra's substance
2. Broadly distinguishing false from true
3. One dharma, different names
4. Gates of entry to substance
5. Pervading as substance of all Sūtras
6. Pervading as substance of all practices
7. Pervading as substance of all dharmas

This is the CBETA order for the substance section: **reveal → refute → name → gates → pervade all sūtras → pervade all practices → pervade all dharmas**.

### Rejecting Previous Interpretations

"Northern masters use 'One Vehicle' as substance... **I don't use this interpretation**."

"Others say 'Ultimate Truth' is substance. This is also too general... **so I don't use it**."

"Others say 'One-Vehicle cause-and-fruit' is substance. **I also don't use this**."

---

### The Correct Substance: Reality-Mark

"**Directly revealing substance: it is the One Reality-Mark Seal.**"

"Among Three Tracks, take True Nature Track. Among Ten Dharma-Realms, take Buddha Dharma-Realm. Among Buddha-realm's Ten Suchnesses, **take Suchness of Substance**."

#### Proof Texts

*Introduction Chapter*: "Now Buddha emits light, **helping to reveal Reality-Mark meaning**."

*Skillful Means Chapter*: "**Only Buddha with Buddha can fully fathom the Reality-Mark of all dharmas**."

*Dharma-Teacher Chapter*: "**Opening the expedient gate, showing true Reality-Mark**."

### The Three Similes for True and False

#### 1. Three Beasts Crossing the River

"Three beasts cross the river, entering the same water... Rabbit and horse are weak—though reaching the other shore, they float shallow, not deep... **The great elephant is strong—reaching both bottom and shore**."

"Water metaphorizes emptiness; bottom metaphorizes non-emptiness... **Only the bodhisattva reaches the bottom**."

#### 2. Crystal vs. Wish-Fulfilling Jewel

"Crystal and wish-fulfilling jewel resemble each other... Crystal is merely empty, cannot rain treasures. **Wish-fulfilling jewel is both empty and rains treasures**."

#### 3. Gold in Stone

"Like gold in yellow stone: Fools don't recognize it, call it stone... Merchants get it, melt out the gold... Goldsmiths get it, make various ornaments... **Alchemists get it, refine it into elixir, fly to heaven, enter earth**."

"**Gold-elixir Reality-Mark is the Sūtra's substance**."

### 3. Judging by Awakening

Zhiyi warns that **correct substance is not grasped by argument alone**. Without awakening, people mistake words for reality: they hear partial descriptions and assume they are the whole. True discernment begins with shame and repentance, matures through calm and clarity, and culminates when insight is steady and non-reactive. At that point one can say “existence” without clinging to existence and say “non-existence” without clinging to non-existence—**because the mind is no longer trapped by either side**. This is the moment the Reality-Mark becomes visible as the sutra’s actual substance, not merely its label.

### 4. One Dharma, Different Names

The Reality-Mark is **one dharma with many names**. It may be called “wonderful existence,” “true and wondrous form,” “ultimate emptiness,” “suchness,” “Nirvāṇa,” “dharma-nature,” “Tathagata Treasury,” “middle reality mind,” “Middle,” “ultimate truth,” or “subtle quiescence.” The difference is **not** in the substance but in the angle of approach. Zhiyi maps this with four relations between name, meaning, and substance: sometimes all three align, sometimes they differ, sometimes name and meaning align while substance differs, and sometimes names and meanings differ while the substance is the same. Disputes arise when people cling to a single label and deny the rest.

He illustrates this with everyday analogies: one person can be known by many titles depending on role; one artisan can be called by different names depending on the craft being highlighted. **The function shifts, but the person remains one.** Likewise, the Reality-Mark is one, and the names are adaptive to different capacities and conditions.

### 5. Gates of Entry to the Reality-Mark

Reality-Mark is subtle and profound, so **one must enter by gates**. Zhiyi presents the four classic gates—existence, emptiness, both, and neither—and shows how they function as **entry points rather than final positions**. These gates are used across different teachings: in some contexts they emphasize analysis and negation; in others they emphasize identity and integration. The guiding point is that **a gate is for entering**, not for clinging. Whether one enters by hearing, by contemplation, or by both together, the aim is the same: **to arrive at the nondual Reality-Mark**.

### 6. Pervading as the Substance of All Sutras, Practices, and Dharmas

Because Reality-Mark is the Dharma-Realm itself, it **pervades all Sūtras**, not only this one; it also **pervades all practices**, because any genuine practice is a response to that same reality. Finally, it **pervades all dharmas**, since every phenomenon is marked by emptiness, provisional existence, and the Middle. The substance is not a separate object; it is the **common ground** that makes every teaching coherent and every practice effective.

### 4. Explaining “Sūtra” Through Dharmas

If “Sūtra” is the proper translation, **which dharma is Sūtra**? Zhiyi answers by listing three modes for this world: **sound**, **written form**, and **dharma as mental object**. While other worlds may use smell, taste, or touch as their primary vehicle, all six sense objects are the Dharma-Realm, so **any of them can function as Sūtra**. For sharp ears, sound is Sūtra; for sharp eyes, written form is Sūtra; for sharp minds, dharma as a mental object is Sūtra. Yet the object itself is not restricted to sharp faculties—**the Dharma-Realm is Sūtra in itself**, whether or not a particular faculty is keen.

He then expands on written form with the **ink-and-characters** example: a single stroke can indicate a number, a word, or a doctrine; a single word can express countless meanings, and countless words can converge on a single meaning. Ink, strokes, words, and sentences can thereby carry **teaching, practice, and principle** in full. Because the written mark can become the basis of both wholesome and unwholesome action, it also serves as the basis for the paths of the four destinies, the four truths, the twelve links, and the three vehicles. This shows that **form is not merely a container for meaning; it can disclose the whole of the teaching** when read correctly.

The conclusion is not that sound or form is privileged, but that **each sense object can be a complete entry to the teaching**. This prepares the shift to the mind itself as the final, most immediate “Sūtra.”

### 5. Observing the Mind as Sūtra

The mind cannot be reduced to only good or only evil; it contains the full range of mental factors and thus **contains all dharmas**. For that reason it fulfills the five untranslatable meanings: it is a **source** (for speech, action, and meaning), it shows **subtle development** (from faint stirrings to clear comprehension), it becomes a **gushing spring** (when insight turns speech, practice, and meaning into inexhaustible flow), it serves as **plumb-line** (cutting deviant views and habits), and it forms a **garland** (binding teaching, practice, and principle so they do not scatter).

It also fulfills the five translatable meanings: mind is the **passage/warp** through which teaching, practice, and principle pass; it **accords** with beings, events, and principles; it **threads** together the scattered strands of understanding; and it **teaches well** by aligning speech, action, and insight. In short, **mind itself is Sūtra**, and observing mind is the direct path to the Reality-Mark. This closes the section on the generic title: the title is not only a word on a page but the living dynamic of mind and dharma.

## Footnotes

[^1]: The **fifteen meanings of Sūtra** represent Master Zhiyi's characteristic expansion of traditional categories. By applying the teaching/practice/principle triad to each of the five untranslatable meanings, he shows the inexhaustible depth of even a single title-character.
