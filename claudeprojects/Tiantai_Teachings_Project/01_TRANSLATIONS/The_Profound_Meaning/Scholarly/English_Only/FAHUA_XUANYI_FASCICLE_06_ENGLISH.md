# The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra

## Fascicle 6: Resonance Subtlety (The Sixth Subtlety)

**Scholarly Translation by The Architect**

---

### Overview

**Why Resonance After Three Dharmas?**

The previous four subtleties are called **Perfect Causes**; the Three Dharmas Secret Treasury is called **Perfect Fruit**. **Fruit-wisdom is quiescent-yet-illuminating; when there is a stimulus, it must manifest response**—hence we clarify Resonance Subtlety.

This has **six topics**:
1. Explaining the names "stimulus" and "response"
2. Explaining their marks
3. Explaining sameness and difference
4. Explaining correspondence
5. Explaining coarse and subtle
6. Explaining mind-contemplation

### 1. Explaining the Names

#### Three Meanings of "Readiness" (Stimulus)

**"Readiness"** (stimulus/readiness) has three meanings:

1.  **Readiness = Subtle**
    First, readiness means **subtle**. Hence the *Yijing* says: "The readiness is **subtlety of movement, the forerunner of fortune**."
    Also the *Āgama* says: "Sentient beings have a readiness of wholesome dharmas; **the sage comes to respond**."
    Like a crossbow has a triggerable readiness—hence the archer triggers it: triggered, the arrow moves; not triggered, it stays still. Sentient beings have producible good; hence **when the sage responds, good arises; without response, it does not arise**.

2.  **Readiness = Hinge/Gate**
    Second, the *Ancient Commentary on the Laṅkāvatāra* says: "Readiness means **hinge/gate**." Why? Sentient beings have good and evil that **hinge upon the sage's compassion**—hence readiness means gate.

3.  **Readiness = Suitability**
    Third, readiness means **suitability**. If one wishes to uproot ignorance-suffering, this is precisely suitable to compassion. If one wishes to give dharma-nature joy, this is precisely suitable to loving-kindness. Hence **readiness means suitability**.

#### Three Meanings of "Response"

Next, explaining **"response"** also has three meanings:

1.  **Response = Going-to**
    First, response means **going-to**. Since we say the readiness has a principle of producibility, when the readiness subtly stirs, **the sage goes to it and good arises**—hence we explain response as "going-to."

2.  **Response = Matching**
    Second, response means **matching**. Like people doing business, mutually corresponding—if one wants to sell but the other doesn't want to buy, they don't correspond...
    Now, taking sentient beings as buyer and Tathāgata as seller—**regarding readiness we discuss the hinge; regarding response we discuss the match**—hence we explain response as "matching."

3.  **Response = Responding**
    Third, response means **responding**. Since we say readiness is suitability, suitable for what dharma? **Responding with compassion-dharmas that suit good and evil**.

### 2. Marks of Stimulus and Response

#### Good and Evil as Readiness

If good and evil are readiness modes, are they single or combined?... Taking **good and evil interlinked** as readiness: from icchantika arising repentant mind up to Equal Awakening, all have good and evil interlinked—hence they can be readiness modes.

#### Three Worlds of Readiness

Sentient beings' good and evil have three times—which time is the readiness?... **Generally speaking, three-times good and evil are all readiness modes. Specifically speaking, only future good and evil are the primary readiness modes.** Why? The past has passed, the present is fixed—it is only for **uprooting future evil and producing future good**.

### 3. Different Types of Stimulus-Response (The Four Sentences)

Now speaking briefly as **four**:

| # | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Hidden readiness, hidden response** | Past good activates; no visible miracle, but secretly benefited by Dharma-body |
| 2 | **Hidden readiness, manifest response** | Past good ripens; now meets Buddha, hears Dharma, obtains benefit |
| 3 | **Manifest readiness, manifest response** | Present practice is vigorous; obtains visible spiritual response |
| 4 | **Manifest readiness, hidden response** | Present practice is strong but no visible response; hidden benefit |

#### 1. Hidden Readiness, Hidden Response

If in the past one cultivated the three karmas in wholesome ways, and in the present has not yet activated body and speech, relying on past wholesome power—this is called **hidden readiness**. Though one does not visibly see spiritual response, one is **secretly benefited by Dharma-body**. Not seeing, not hearing, yet awakening and knowing—this is called **hidden benefit**.

#### 2. Hidden Readiness, Manifest Response

**Hidden readiness, manifest benefit**: Past-planted good makes the hidden readiness complete; one then **meets Buddha, hears Dharma, obtains benefit in the present**—this is manifest benefit.

When the Buddha first appeared in the world, the first people to be liberated—had they cultivated in the present? **Buddhas illuminate their past readiness and go to liberate them**—this is that meaning.

#### 3. Manifest Readiness, Manifest Response

**Manifest readiness, manifest response**: Present body and speech are diligently tireless, and able to evoke descent. Like Sudatta kneeling long, Buddha went to Jetavana. Like Candrachatra bowing, the sage resided at his door.

Like practitioners in the practice-hall performing repentance, **able to evoke spiritual auspiciousness**—this is manifest readiness, manifest response.

#### 4. Manifest Readiness, Hidden Response

**Manifest readiness, hidden response**: Like a person who toils diligently their whole life, present good thickly accumulated but no manifest response—**there is hidden benefit**—this is manifest readiness, hidden benefit.

#### The Practical Takeaway

**If you understand these four meanings, every bow of the head and raising of the hand—merit is not discarded in vain. Though all day without visible response, all day without regret.**

If you see those who enjoy killing yet live long, or those who love giving yet are impoverished—**do not generate wrong views**. If one doesn't understand this, one thinks one's efforts are wasted and regrets losing principle.

### Thirty-Six Sentences

If we fully analyze, we use **four readiness modes as roots**: hidden, manifest, both hidden-and-manifest, neither hidden-nor-manifest.

**Hidden is past; manifest is present; both is past-and-present; neither is future.**

Within one sentence, there are again four sentences... Four times four makes **sixteen sentences**. Readiness calls response; response also has sixteen sentences.

**One readiness stimulates four responses; one response goes to four readiness modes**—readiness and response each are sixteen, combining to make thirty-two sentences. Adding the root four sentences makes **thirty-six sentences of stimulus-response**.

### 5. Coarse and Subtle Judgment

#### Readiness Coarse and Subtle

**Nine-realm readiness is coarse; Buddha-realm readiness is subtle.** Coarse readiness calls skillful-means responses...

**Subtle readiness calls ultimate subtle responses**; subtle readiness also has unripe and ripe; subtle responses also have shallow and deep.

#### Response Coarse and Subtle

Tripiṭaka and Common Teaching sages also have responses, but these are **intentional supernatural powers**—like paintings that require deliberate effort to complete, at core without foundation. Why? **Ash-body, extinguished-wisdom—no constant-abiding foundation—from what does response arise?**

If Distinct and Perfect teachings, the initial mind subdues delusion but cannot yet have response. At first ground or first abiding, when the three contemplations are present, one realizes the twenty-five samādhis. **Dharma-body is pure, undefiled like empty space, tranquil yet responding to all, without thought or intention, immediately matching the readiness.**

#### The Mirror Simile

Like the one moon does not descend, the hundred waters do not rise, yet **following rivers' length, conforming to vessels' shapes, without before or after, simultaneously universally manifesting**—this is **inconceivable subtle response**.

Also like a **bright mirror**, clear inside and out, one image or a thousand images, **no selection, no effort required, naturally resembling**—this is called subtle response.

### Opening Coarse to Reveal Subtle

This sūtra returns the immeasurable to one—this is **opening expedient to reveal real; the coarse itself is subtle**.

Like three grasses and two trees, they are simply **produced from one ground—same-source readiness is one**. Moistened by one rain—**same-received response is one**.

The foolish don't understand, thinking grasses and trees' four elements are forever not the ground. **The wise thoroughly comprehend**: four elements arising is simply ground transforming; four elements ceasing is simply returning to ground—**how could grass and trees not be the ground?**

This is **opening expedient to reveal real**, definitively clarifying śrāvaka dharma—this is the king of sūtras. **Nine-realm readiness is all Buddha-realm readiness; responses of the four sages are nothing but subtle responses.**

### Summary Table: Four Sentences of Resonance

| Type | Readiness | Response | Example |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Hidden / Hidden** | Past good (hidden) | Dharma-body benefit (hidden) | Not seeing Buddha, yet awakening |
| **Hidden / Manifest** | Past good (hidden) | Meeting Buddha (manifest) | First disciples at Buddha's arising |
| **Manifest / Manifest** | Present practice (manifest) | Visible miracle (manifest) | Sudatta and Jetavana |
| **Manifest / Hidden** | Present practice (manifest) | Hidden benefit only | Lifelong practice, no visible sign |

### 6. Mind Contemplation

Zhiyi closes the Resonance dialectic by turning to the **mind itself**—to the affective and cognitive habits that both constitute readiness and make response possible. In the *Fahua Xuanyi*, “mind-contemplation” is described as a six-fold observation of the heart’s *love* (attachment) and *view* (conceptual grasping) together with their allies (the inner judgments that sustain them). When the practitioner watches how love arises from ignorance and sees how view fabricates dharmas as either “real” or “expedient,” the same capacities that once fed defilements can be redirected toward wisdom. Observing love as the parent of craving, view as the architect of illusion, and perceiving their arising and passing through the fourfold contemplations (see/view/other) reveals that the very substratum of attachment already contains the Pure Land within it. In Tiantai language, once one observes “love” as dharmic nature, “view” as nondual seeing, and the four observations as empty-conditional processes, the mind itself becomes both stimulus and response—no longer clinging to coarse formulas but resting in subtle clarity. This is why Zhiyi lists love-mind, view-mind, and the four observational correspondences under the mind-contemplation chapter: they are not just psychological accessories but the final integration point where readiness and response collapse into a nondual “observing mind” that knows, without effort, how every stage of practice is both the cause and the fruit of Resonance Subtlety.

### 7. Magical Powers Subtlety

Zhiyi orders this section by **four intentions**, in sequence:
1. **Three wheels** (body‑speech‑mind) as the base for transformation.  
2. **Six powers** (heavenly eye/ear, other‑mind, past lives, body‑transformation, unobstructed wisdom).  
3. **Realm differences** (ghosts, humans, devas, arhats, bodhisattvas) showing graded display.  
4. **Coarse vs. subtle** powers, culminating in the Perfect Teaching’s effortless transformation.

The Lotus Sūtra’s signs (flowers, lights, drums) are framed as **natural fruits** of the wheels.  
The **no‑intention transformation samādhi** shows subtle response as mirror‑like and immediate.  
CBETA contrasts **coarse powers** (crafted, effortful, breakable) with **subtle powers** (natural, unforced, grounded in the Middle).

### 8. Teaching Subtlety

Zhiyi proceeds in order:
1. **Twelve canonical designations** (sūtra, gāthā, upadeśa, parable, analogy, etc.).  
2. **Four naming patterns** and the parts of the compendia.  
3. **Five flavors** as coarse ordering in earlier teachings.  
4. **Lotus as opening/combining** that reveals the **one Middle**.

Thus the Lotus treats all names as **pointing to the Reality‑Mark**, not as a hierarchy of separate truths.

### 9. Retinue Subtlety

Zhiyi aligns the retinue to **readiness‑response** in this sequence:
1. **Hearing and trust** form the outer retinue.  
2. **Practice and discipline** form the inner retinue.  
3. **Love‑mind and view‑mind** are examined as roots of clinging.  
4. **Karmic affinity and vow** convert former hostility into kinship.

Thus the retinue is **not merely external disciples** but **inner heirs** formed by the Perfect Teaching.

### 10. Merits and Benefits

Zhiyi orders the benefits as **four layers**:
1. **Buddha’s intent** (why benefits arise).  
2. **Correct proclamation** (how benefits are triggered).  
3. **Propagation** (how benefits spread).  
4. **Mind‑contemplation** (how benefits are internalized).

Within these, he traces **graded benefits** (cause/fruit, vehicle‑specific, and powers), showing that the Four Sentences of resonance yield **countless benefits** even for those once opposed to the Dharma.

Zhiyi then walks through the **tenfold sequence**: the first benefit is the fruit-level relief (the various hells, hungry ghosts, devas etc. gaining coolness); the second is the cause-level transformation (the 21 harmful karmas breaking); the third and fourth are the samādhic powers for hearers and contemplatives; the fifth is the middle-way purification; the sixth through ninth cover gradual conversions (three vehicles, provisional lands, etc.); and the tenth is the consummate fruit of the real land (nonbirth/nondeath). He also answers a rhetorical question about why ten benefits are necessary: each one corresponds to a deeper defilement being cut so that the Buddha can net every capacity, from coarse duty to final realization. Another question underscores that the same three truths (conventional, ultimate, middle) pervade every realm—if the same truths are present even in ordinary appearances, then the Lotus Sutra’s resonance has already woven those truths into every readiness-and-response moment.

## Footnotes

[^1]: The **Four Sentences** of resonance are Master Zhiyi's analysis of how spiritual practice relates to spiritual response. This teaching is profoundly pastoral: it explains why sincere practitioners may not see visible results (hidden response to manifest readiness), and why unexpected transformations occur (manifest response to hidden readiness). The key teaching: "Every bow of the head—merit is not discarded in vain."
