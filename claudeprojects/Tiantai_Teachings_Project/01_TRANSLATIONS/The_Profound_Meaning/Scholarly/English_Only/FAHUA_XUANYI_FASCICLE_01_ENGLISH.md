### Part I: Prefatory Material

#### [1] The Origins of the Private Record
*Composed by the Śramaṇa Guanding (561–632 CE)*

**1. On the Unparalleled Virtue of Master Zhiyi**

When the Great Dharma flowed eastward, as recorded in the *Histories of the Saṅgha*—how many were there who, never having attended a lecture, attained understanding of the Buddha Vehicle on their own?

Even granting such awakening, could any then enter samādhi and attain dhāraṇī?[^1]

Even possessing both concentration and wisdom, did any then propagate **concentration and wisdom** in the Imperial Capital?[^2]

Even with flourishing assemblies, did any then dismiss their disciples and seclude themselves in mountain valleys?

Even while shunning the world and guarding the profound, were any then summoned to serve as National Preceptor to two dynasties?[^3]

Even being honored by emperors, did any then expound the *Renwang Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra* in the Tàijí Hall before the sovereign?

Even proclaiming the Dharma in the main hall, did any receive the Three Prostrations from the ruler?

Even having the Emperor of Ten Thousand Chariots bend his knee, did a hundred high seats and a hundred officials voice praise and admiration, snapping their fingers until the hall resounded?

Even with monastics and laity in reverent attention, did any profoundly awaken to the Perfect Meaning of the Lotus Sutra?

Even having grasped the sūtra's meaning, could any transcend written words and, with the eloquence of joyful speech, pour forth teaching day and night without cease?

**Only our Master Zhiyi fully possessed all these virtues.**

**2. Guanding's Personal Testimony**

How fortunate I, Guanding! Long ago in Jiànye,[^4] I first heard the textual teachings. Later in Jiānglíng, I was graced to receive the *Profound Meaning*. In my later years, returning to Mount Tiantai, I was present for the Crane Grove.[^5]

Traveling back and forth between Jing and Yang,[^6] a journey of nearly ten thousand *li*, piecing together teachings from before and after—I barely managed to hear [the complete exposition] once through.

It is not merely that what I had not heard remained unheard; even what I did hear remained incomprehensible. Rolling and unrolling [the text], studying and contemplating, I became ever more aware of its solidity and loftiness. Yet I lamented my shallow karmic connection—unable to ask a second or third time, with no place to make inquiry—like a calf longing for milk.

Moreover, I thought: "If these words should be lost, future generations would be pitiable indeed."

The *Nirvāṇa Sūtra* speaks of [inscribing the Dharma on] trees and stones; this present sūtra speaks of [planting seeds in] fields and villages.[^7] Following the holy scriptures, I have written them down to transmit them—the *Profound Meaning* and the *Textual Commentary*, each in ten fascicles.

Some [sections] use the sincere words of sūtras and śāstras to accord with this profound and wonderful [teaching]; others mark the divergent interpretations of various masters, verifying that those are not the Perfect [doctrine]. Practitioners of future generations will know that the Gate of Sweet Dew[^8] is found herein.

#### [2] The Executive Summary (The "King's Preface")[^9]

**1. Explanation of "Myō"**

What is meant by "Myō" (Wonderful)? The name "Myō" signifies *the inconceivable*.

What is meant by "Dharma"? It is the Dharma of the Ten Dharma-Realms, the Ten Suchnesses, and the Provisional and Real.[^10]

"Lotus Flower" is a metaphor for the Dharma of Provisional and Real.

Since the Wonderful Dharma is difficult to understand, metaphors make it manifest!

Moreover, the meanings are many; briefly comparing the preceding and following, they combine into six.[^11]

**2. The Six-Fold Lotus Metaphor: Trace Gate**

**First: "The flower exists for the sake of the lotus"—this metaphors *granting the Provisional for the sake of the Real*.**

The text says: "Knowing the supreme extinction, yet through the power of skillful means, though he shows various paths, they are truly for the Buddha Vehicle."[^12]

**Second: "The flower blooming" metaphors *Opening the Provisional*; "The lotus appearing" metaphors *Revealing the Real*.**

The text says: "Open the gate of skillful means, and reveal the Reality-Mark."[^13]

**Third: "The flower falling" metaphors *Abolishing the Provisional*; "The lotus maturing" metaphors *Establishing the Real*.**

The text says: "Setting aside skillful means directly, he teaches only the unsurpassed Way."[^14]

**3. The Six-Fold Lotus Metaphor: Fundamental Gate**

**First:** the *lotus* metaphors the *Fundamental*; the *flower* metaphors the *Trace*. From the Fundamental, the Trace descends; the Trace depends upon the Fundamental.

The text says: "In truth, since I attained Buddhahood, it has been this long. But to teach and convert sentient beings, I spoke thus: 'In my youth I left home and attained supreme complete enlightenment.'"[^15]

**Second: "The flower blooming" metaphors *Opening the Trace*; "The lotus appearing" metaphors *Revealing the Fundamental*.**

The text says: "All the world thought I had just now attained the Way; [but] since I became Buddha, it has been immeasurable, boundless nayutas of kalpas."[^16]

**Third: "The flower falling" metaphors *Abolishing the Trace*; "The lotus maturing" metaphors *Establishing the Fundamental*.**

The text says: "All Buddha Tathāgatas—their Dharmas are all thus. For the sake of saving sentient beings, all is real and not false."[^17]

**4. Summary of the Lotus Metaphor**

Therefore, first the Wonderful Dharma is proclaimed, then the Lotus Flower is employed as metaphor: to sweep away the fixed teaching of the Conjured City,[^18] to abolish the stagnant attachments of the Grass Hut;[^19] to open the Provisional gate of skillful means, to reveal the wonderful principle of Reality-Mark; to integrate the small practices of various goods, returning them to the vast and great One Vehicle; beings of superior, middling, and inferior roots—all receive the bestowal of prediction.

Again, he manifests the expedient skill of the many Sages, revealing the subtle profundity of the Original Ground. Therefore, the Way increases and [transmigration in] birth diminishes; one's stage approaches the Great Awakening.

In the single period of guiding transformation, both phenomena and principle are perfectly complete. The meaning of the Lotus Flower metaphor lies herein.

**5. On "Sūtra"**

"Sūtra"—in foreign lands it is called *sūtra*—is the general name for the holy teachings. Whether translated or untranslated, the matter is as explained later.

#### [3] Commentary by the Recorder (Guanding)

The Recorder's explanation: The "Preface" expounds the profound meaning of the sūtra.

The profound meaning is expressed through the heart of the text; the heart of the text is none other than the Trace and the Fundamental.

Looking up at this purport, the multitude of meanings becomes crystal clear.

"Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower" expounds the *Name*. "Revealing the wonderful principle of Reality-Mark" expounds the *Substance*. "Returning to the vast and great One Vehicle" expounds the *Essence*. "Sweeping away the fixed teaching of the Conjured City" expounds the *Function*. "The single period of transformation is perfectly complete" expounds the *Teaching*. The six metaphors expound the Trace and Fundamental. The text is concise, yet the meaning is complete.

### Part II: The Main Discourse
**The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra**

#### [1] Introduction to the Five Chapters

1.  **Interpreting the Name**
2.  **Discerning the Substance**
3.  **Clarifying the Essence**
4.  **Discussing the Function**
5.  **Classifying the Teaching**

**General and Particular Interpretations**

In interpreting these five chapters, there is the *general* and the *particular*.

The general refers to shared meaning; the particular refers to distinctive meaning.

These five chapters can be used to interpret all sūtras—hence they are called "shared."

Yet the Name differs [for each sūtra], and so on through to the Teaching classification—hence they are called "distinctive."

As an example: at the beginning of every sūtra, five items are established—this is the shared meaning.[^20] But "Thus" (*evam*) is interpreted differently, the "I heard" refers to different persons, the "one time" refers to different occasions of resonance, the Buddha's dwelling place differs, and the assembly of listeners differs—this is the distinctive meaning.

Again, "general" means *collective* meaning; "particular" means *individual* meaning. This general-and-particular [analysis] is directed specifically at this one text.

The general [approach] consists of **seven shared interpretations**. The particular [approach] consists of **five layers of individual exposition**.

Just as [the teaching must accommodate] the sharp and the dull, it requires both the extensive and the concise approaches.

The general and particular aspects of all teachings—that is not our present concern. The general and particular aspects of this one sūtra—that is what we shall now analyze.

### The Seven Shared Interpretations

The general [approach] employs seven shared interpretations:

1.  **Establishing the Chapters**
2.  **Citing Evidence**
3.  **Demonstrating the Arising**
4.  **Opening and Combining**
5.  **Critical Discrimination**
6.  **Observing the Mind**
7.  **Reconciling Differences**

#### The Purpose of Each Interpretation

**Establishing the Chapters** makes them easy to memorize and retain, arousing the *mind of mindfulness*.

**Citing Evidence** relies on the Buddha's words, arousing the *mind of faith*.

**Demonstrating the Arising** prevents confusion and disorder, arousing the *mind of concentration*.

**Opening and Combining**, **Critical Discrimination**, and **Reconciling Differences** arouse the *mind of wisdom*.

**Observing the Mind** means to hear and immediately practice, arousing the *mind of vigor*.

When the Five Minds are established, they become the Five Faculties.[^21] They dispel the Five Hindrances, become the Five Powers, and lead even to entry into the Three Gates of Liberation.[^22]

This is a summary of the seven levels and their shared purpose.

#### The Detailed Exposition

The detailed interpretation of the Five Chapters causes each to extensively arouse the Five Minds and the Five Faculties, enabling one to *open, reveal, awaken to, and enter* the Buddha's knowledge and vision.[^23]

### Chapter 1: Interpreting the Name

First, establishing the Five Chapters. The establishment of the Name has four aspects: (1) Establishing, (2) Distinguishing, (3) Concluding, (4) Illustrating with metaphor.

#### 1. Establishing the Name

**Establishing:** The original sage established names in order to open what is profound and advance those at the beginning. He caused all to look and listen, enabling all to see and hear. Following the path, they proceed from afar and arrive at the ultimate. Therefore, names are used to designate the Dharma, providing for sentient beings.

#### 2. Distinguishing Coarse and Wonderful

**Distinguishing:** Dharmas may be *coarse* or *wonderful*. If the Three Truths are held as separate and sequential, it is the coarse Dharma. If the Three Truths are perfectly interfused, it is the Wonderful Dharma.[^24]

This Wonderful Truth is originally existent. The text says: "This Dharma abides in its Dharma-position; the worldly marks are eternally abiding. Only I know this mark, and the Buddhas of the ten directions likewise."[^25]

Even non-retrogressing bodhisattvas and the Two Vehicles who have entered realization cannot know it—how much less the masses of humans and devas!

Though the Buddha knows this, he does not hasten to teach it.

The text says: "If I were to praise the Buddha Vehicle, beings immersed in suffering, slandering the Dharma and lacking faith, would fall into the three evil paths."[^26]

Therefore the earlier teachings unfold in a **specific progression**:
1. The first teaching **sets up integrated and non‑integrated**, but those of lesser capacity do not hear it.  
2. The second teaching **establishes only the non‑integrated**, which the great do not use.  
3. The third teaching **sets up both**, using the integrated to shame attachment to the non‑integrated.  
4. The fourth teaching **sets up both again**, letting the small rely on the integrated and the great move from the non‑integrated into the integrated.

All of these are **spoken to suit capacities**, not the Buddha’s final intent. The Lotus **sets aside the non‑integrated and speaks only the integrated**, revealing the Buddha’s original intent.

Therefore, in the First Teaching, both fused and unfused [truths] were established, yet those of lesser roots did not even hear it.

Now, this present sūtra directly sets aside the unfused and teaches only the fused, causing the entire assembly to share one flavor of the Way. This fully expresses the Tathāgata's original intention in appearing in the world. Therefore this sūtra is established and named "Wonderful."

#### 3. Concluding Statement

**Concluding:** You should understand that the *Avataṃsaka* *includes* [the One Vehicle with the separate vehicles]; the *Tripiṭaka* teaches *only* [the separate vehicles]; *Vaipulya* *contrasts* [One with Three]; *Prajñā* *carries* [the Three while teaching the One].[^27]

This sūtra no longer includes, only-teaches, contrasts, or carries. It is exclusively the direct, unsurpassed Way. Therefore it is called the Wonderful Dharma.

#### 4. The Lotus Metaphor

**Illustrating with metaphor:** The lotus flower likewise has coarse and wonderful [examples].

How so? A coarse, wild flower has no fruit. Or one flower with many fruits. Or many flowers with one fruit. Or one flower with one fruit. Or fruit before flower. Or flower before fruit.

The first illustrates non-Buddhists who cultivate pure conduct in vain and gain nothing. The second illustrates ordinary beings who serve their parents and are reborn in the Brahma heavens. The third illustrates śrāvakas who practice various austerities and merely attain nirvāṇa. The fourth illustrates pratyekabuddhas who practice one form of renunciation and also attain nirvāṇa. The fifth illustrates stream-enterers who later progress on the path. The sixth illustrates bodhisattvas who first rely on conditioned cultivation and later attain true cultivation.

All of these are coarse flowers and are not used as the metaphor.

The lotus flower has many extraordinary [qualities]: **The flower exists for the sake of the lotus**—flower and fruit are complete together—this can metaphor *the Real manifesting through the Provisional*. **The flower opens and the lotus appears**—this can metaphor *the Provisional revealing the Real*. **The flower falls and the lotus matures; the mature lotus also falls**—this can metaphor *neither Provisional nor Real*.

Because of these many convenient meanings, the lotus flower is used to metaphor the Wonderful Dharma.

### Chapter 2: Discerning the Substance

The Substance has four aspects: (1) Explaining the character, (2) Citing agreement, (3) Discriminating what is not [the Substance], (4) Concluding the correct [Substance].

The character *substance* is glossed as *propriety/law*. Propriety means law.

[The teaching] directly points to *Reality-Mark* and takes it as the correct Substance.

Therefore, the "Lifespan" chapter says: "Unlike the three realms, yet seeing the three realms—neither same nor different."[^28]

Now we take what the Buddha sees as the correct Substance: the Reality-Mark.

### Chapter 3: Clarifying the Essence

The Essence has three aspects: (1) Indicating, (2) Discriminating, (3) Concluding.

*Essence* means *essential*. The Buddha's own practice of cause and effect is taken as the Essence.

What makes it essential? Immeasurable goods—speak of "cause" and they are included. Immeasurable realizations—speak of "effect" and they are included. It is like lifting the main cord of a net: no mesh fails to move. It is like pulling one corner of a garment: no thread fails to follow.

Therefore it is called the "essential essence."

### Chapter 4: Discussing the Function

The Function has three aspects: (1) Indicating, (2) Discriminating, (3) Benefits.

*Function* means *power and function*. The three kinds of Provisional-and-Real dual wisdom are all power and function.[^29]

Within power and function, further distinction is made: The dual wisdom of self-practice, which illuminates principle thoroughly—this is called *power*. The two kinds of dual wisdom for transforming others, which discerns readiness universally—this is called *function*.

The transforming merit is vast and great; the benefit is profound and deep. This is the power and function of this sūtra.

### Chapter 5: Classifying the Teaching

The Teaching Classification has three aspects: (1) The marks of root-natures as fused or unfused. (2) The marks of the path of transformation as complete or incomplete. (3) The marks of teacher and disciple as remote or near.

*Teaching* refers to the sage's words bestowed upon those below. *Marks* refers to distinguishing sameness and difference.

#### The Five Flavors

It is like the sun first rising, first illuminating the high mountains. Those who had thickly planted good roots were moved by this sudden teaching. The sudden teaching was not originally for those of lesser roots. Though the lesser sat in the assembly, they were like the deaf or mute. This is because the small cannot bear the great, and the great is separated from the small. This is like the *Avataṃsaka*.

Considered in terms of Dharma matching conditions, it is called the **Sudden Teaching Mark**. Considered in terms of the sequence of teaching, it is called the **Milk-from-the-Cow Flavor Mark**.[^30]

Next it illuminates the dark valleys. This is like the *Tripiṭaka*, called the **Curds Flavor Mark**.

Next it illuminates the level ground. This is like *Vimalakīrti* and *Vaipulya*, the **Fresh Butter Flavor Mark**.

This is like the *Great Perfection of Wisdom*, the **Clarified Butter Flavor Mark**.

This is like this present sūtra, the ***Ghee* Flavor Mark**.[^31]

#### The Lotus Sutra's Unique Position

Now, this *Lotus Sūtra* is **revealed**, not secret. It is **gradual-becoming-sudden**, not gradual-upon-gradual. It is **combined**, not uncombined. It is **ghee**, not the [previous] four flavors. It is **definite**, not indefinite.

By these distinctions, this sūtra differs from all other sūtras.

---

### Section 2: Citing Evidence

#### Scriptural Evidence for the Name

As Mañjuśrī replied in verse: "I saw the Buddha Lamp-Bright; the original auspicious light was just like this. From this I know the present Buddha intends to teach the *Lotus Sūtra*."[^32]

Not only the two trillion [Buddhas of the Lamp-Bright lineage]—the Great Pervasive Wisdom Excellence Buddha and the Three-World Buddhas in the Five Buddha Chapters—all taught what is named "Lotus."

The text says: "Now the Buddha emits radiance to assist in revealing the meaning of Reality-Mark." And: "The meaning of the Reality-Mark of all dharmas has already been taught to you." And: "The one honored by immeasurable beings teaches the Reality-Mark Seal."

This also shows that past and present [Buddhas] alike take Reality-Mark as the Substance.

#### Scriptural Evidence for Essence and Function

The text says: "The Buddha shall rain the Dharma rain, fulfilling those who seek the Way." This is the Dharma rain that integrates the Three into the One, causing those who seek the Buddha Way as *cause* to be fulfilled, and indeed causing all to be integrated and fulfilled.

If it is the Dharma rain that opens the near to reveal the remote, it causes those who seek the Buddha Way as *fruit* to be fulfilled.

The text says: "Those seeking the Three Vehicles, if any have doubts or regrets, the Buddha shall eliminate them entirely, leaving nothing remaining." And: "The Dharma of all Buddhas, after a long time, must finally speak the truth." This is the elimination of doubts about the Three Vehicles, Five Vehicles, Seven Expedients, and Nine Dharma-Realms, causing all to give rise to faith.

This is evidence for the sūtra's Function.

#### The "Supernatural Powers" Chapter Evidence

The "Supernatural Powers of the Tathāgata" chapter says: "To speak in summary: all the Dharmas of the Tathāgata, all the sovereign supernatural powers of the Tathāgata, all the secret essential treasury of the Tathāgata, all the profound matters of the Tathāgata—all are proclaimed and revealed in this sūtra."[^33]

"All Dharmas" means all Dharmas, both Provisional and Real, are included—this is evidence for the sūtra's **Name**.

"All sovereign supernatural powers"—inner functioning is called sovereignty, outer functioning is called supernatural power—this is evidence for the **Function**.

"All the secret essential treasury"—not to grant to the unworthy vessel is called secret; the correct Substance is called essential; containing much yet without accumulation is called treasury—this is evidence for the **Substance**.

"All profound matters"—Reality-Mark is called profound; cultivating causes for Reality-Mark is called profound cause; ultimate Reality-Mark is called profound fruit.

#### The "Dharma Teacher" Chapter Evidence

The "Dharma Teacher" chapter says: "If one hears this sūtra, this is the good practice of the bodhisattva path"—the profound cause.

"Those who seek the Buddha Way, who before me have heard even one phrase of the *Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sūtra*, or even given rise to a single thought of rejoicing—I give them all prediction [of Buddhahood]. Even those who hear it for just a moment immediately attain the profound fruit of ultimate *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*."[^34]

This is evidence for the **Essence**.

If we were to cite further: **“For one great cause and condition”** confirms the **Name**; **“Buddha knowledge and vision”** confirms the **Substance**; **“open, reveal, awaken, enter”** confirms the **Essence**; **“for the sake of sentient beings”** confirms the **Function**; and **“this differs from other sūtras”** confirms the **Teaching**.

#### The Six Similes from the "Medicine King" Chapter

The "Medicine King" chapter presents ten similes praising this Teaching. Now we cite six: **Great as the ocean**, **High as the mountain**, **Round as the moon**, **Brilliant as the sun**, **Sovereign as Brahma**, **Ultimate as Buddha**.

**1. Great as the Ocean**

The ocean has the virtue of receiving—all streams return to it; all share the same saltiness. The *Lotus Sūtra* is likewise: what the Buddha has realized, the ten thousand goods return to, all riding the One Buddha Vehicle.

Rivers and lakes do not have this great virtue; other sūtras are the same. Therefore the *Lotus* is the greatest.

**2. High as the Mountain**

The Mountain King (Mount Sumeru) is highest, formed of four treasures, where only devas dwell. The *Lotus* is likewise: at the summit of the Four Flavor Teachings, free from the four slanders,[^35] opening, revealing, awakening, and entering—purely one root, one condition, one flavor of the Way—purely bodhisattvas, with no śrāvaka disciples.

**3. Round as the Moon**

The moon can wax and wane; the moon gradually becomes full. The *Lotus* is likewise: the Provisional and Real share one substance; the gradual is integrated into the sudden.

**4. Brilliant as the Sun**

Lamps, torches, stars, and moon coexist with darkness—this metaphors how other sūtras preserve the Two Vehicle paths and fruits, allowing the small to stand alongside. The sun can destroy darkness.

The *Lotus* destroys the Conjured City and removes the Grass Hut. The sun outshines stars and moon, making them invisible. The *Lotus* removes the traces and dispenses with skillful means.

**5. Sovereign as Brahma**

A wheel-turning king is sovereign over the four continents; Śakra is sovereign over the Thirty-Three Heavens; Great Brahma is sovereign over the Three Realms. Other sūtras may be sovereign in conventional truth, or in ultimate truth, or in the Middle—but these are all separate sovereignties, not great sovereignty.

This present sūtra's Three Truths are perfectly interfused, achieving the greatest sovereignty—metaphorically, the Great Brahma King.

**6. Ultimate as Buddha**

Other sūtras deliver beings from birth-and-death, like the Five Buddha Sons, who are first among ordinary beings. Or they deliver beings from nirvāṇa, like bodhisattvas who dwell above the non-learners. This present sūtra delivers beings beyond the bodhisattvas of the expedient teachings, immediately becoming Dharma Kings—the ultimate first.

### Section 3: Demonstrating the Arising

"That which generates" is called *arising*; "that which is generated" is called *starting*. There is a sequence from before to after; coarse and subtle do not conflict.

[Sēng]zhào said: "Names have no power to summon things; things have no reality to respond to names. If there are no names and no things, where are names and things?" This is the meaning of no-marks in the first principle.

Speaking in terms of conventional truth: without names, there is no way to reveal the Dharma—hence we first interpret the Name. Names designate the Dharma; the Dharma is the Substance. Following names, we recognize the Substance. The Substance cannot be integrated without the Essence. Integrating the Substance, self-practice is already complete. From the Substance arises Function, guiding and benefiting sentient beings. Since the benefits are many, we must distinguish the Teaching Classification.

The "Supernatural Powers" chapter also follows this sequence: all dharmas are originally Buddha-dharma; first the Buddha uses supernatural power to shock and awaken, then teaches the Dharma; the teaching explicates Reality-Mark; receiving the teaching and practicing yields cause-and-fruit.

#### The Arising According to "Open, Reveal, Awaken, Enter"

"Open, reveal, awaken, enter"—this also follows the sequence of practice. The Dharma originally has neither opening nor closing; now we call it "opening the gate of skillful means"—this is hearing the **Name**. "Revealing the Reality-Mark"—the **Substance**. "Being confused yet attaining awakening"—awakening to the **cause**. "Due to cause, awakening to fruit"—the **Essence**. "Awakening, one deeply enters and causes others to enter"—the **Function**. "Distinguishing sameness and difference"—the **Teaching**.

These five meanings follow the sequence of practice supported by the "Introduction" chapter.

### Section 4: Opening and Combining

The Five Chapters together interpret one sūtra. Various distinctions are made for ease of understanding. There are three kinds of opening and combining: the five kinds, the ten kinds, and simile.

#### The Five-Kind Opening

First: Interpreting the Name discusses both phenomena and principle. Discerning the Substance discusses only principle. Essence and Function discuss only phenomena. Teaching Classification distinguishes phenomena and principle.

Interpreting the Name discusses both teaching and practice. Discerning the Substance is neither teaching nor practice. Essence and Function are only practice. Teaching Classification is only teaching.

Interpreting the Name discusses both cause and effect. Discerning the Substance is neither cause nor effect. Essence is self-practice cause-and-effect. Function teaches others cause-and-effect. Teaching Classification distinguishes the above dharmas.

Interpreting the Name includes both self-practice and transforming others. Substance is neither self nor other. Essence is self-practice; Function is transforming others; Teaching Classification distinguishes self and other.

Interpreting the Name includes both speaking and silence. Substance is neither speaking nor silence. Essence is silence; Function is speech; Teaching Classification distinguishes the above.

#### The Ten-Kind Opening (Brief)

The Name broadly includes the **Three Tracks**, **Three Paths**, and **Three Virtues**. Substance, Essence, and Function open into those three, and Teaching Classification distinguishes them. This is the tenfold opening in outline.

#### The Simile: The Human Body

**Simile**: It is like the general designation "human body." Opening the body, there are consciousness, life, and warmth; distinguishing various bodies—noble or base, wise or foolish—there are various gradations. The **human body** metaphors the **Name**. **Consciousness** metaphors the **Substance**. **Life** metaphors the **Essence**. **Warmth** metaphors the **Function**. **Distinguishing** metaphors the **Teaching Classification**.

### Section 5: Critical Discrimination

This section presents a series of questions and answers addressing potential objections.

#### Q1: Doesn't "flower for the lotus" imply cause contains effect?

**Q:** If "the flower exists for the sake of the lotus" and flower and fruit necessarily coexist, doesn't this fall into [the Sāṃkhya heresy of] "effect within cause"?

**A:** "Effect within cause" is the old physician's heretical doctrine, already refuted by the initial teaching. It is not even the coarse meaning of Provisional and Real—how much less the wonderful cause and wonderful fruit of the new physician's true milk Dharma!

#### Q2: If the flower metaphors the Provisional, why destroy the Grass Hut?

**Q:** If the flower metaphors the Provisional, and the Provisional is the Small Vehicle dharma, then it should not destroy the Grass Hut. Since the Grass Hut is destroyed, how can the flower metaphor the Provisional?

**A:** The Small Vehicle is the **expedient for transforming others**—therefore it must be destroyed. Now we clarify the **expedient of self-practice**—hence the flower is used as metaphor.

#### Q3: Why five chapters, not four or six?

**Q:** Why five chapters, not four or six?

**A:** If we made it four or six, doubt would likewise arise, falling into infinite questioning. This is not [the point].

### Section 6: Observing the Mind

This is the practical core of the Seven Interpretations—transforming doctrine into meditation.

#### The Mind and the Title

The mind is like a magical flame—it merely has a name; it is called "mind." Just when you say it exists, you don't see its form or substance. Just when you say it doesn't exist, thoughts arise again. Because it cannot be measured by existence or non-existence, the mind is called **"Wonderful"**.

The wonderful mind can be a guiding standard—it is called **"Dharma"**.

The dharma of mind is neither cause nor effect; yet when contemplated in accord with principle, it accomplishes cause and effect—this is called **"Lotus Flower"**.

Through one mind, contemplation is accomplished, and it transforms to teach other minds—this is called **"Sūtra"**.

This completes the interpretation of the Name.

#### The Mind as Substance, Essence, Function

The mind originally has no name, nor is it "no-name." The name of mind is not arising, nor is it ceasing. **The mind is the Reality-Mark.**

Initial contemplation is **cause**; accomplished contemplation is **fruit**.

Because of contemplating the mind, evil thoughts do not arise. The mental factors and afflictions, whether same or different, are all transformed—this is contemplating the mind.

#### The Six Stages of Identity

If you wish to escape poverty, you must diligently [practice] the Three Contemplations. If you wish to escape arrogance, you must hear [of] the Six Stages of Identity.[^36]

"The worldly marks are eternally abiding"—this is **Identity in Principle**.

"If regarding all past Buddhas, one has heard even a single phrase"—this is **Identity in Name**.

"Deep faith and rejoicing"—this is **Identity in Contemplative Practice**.

"Six sense faculties purified"—this is **Identity in Resemblance**.

"Abiding in real wisdom"—this is **Identity in Partial Realization**.

"Only a Buddha and a Buddha can fathom the reality of all dharmas"—this is **Identity in Ultimate Realization**.

#### The Balance of Study and Practice

The *Avataṃsaka* says: "Like a poor person who day and night counts others' treasures yet has not half a coin"—this is the fault of **one-sided study**.

The text below says: "Claiming attainment without attainment, claiming realization without realization"—this is the fault of **one-sided meditation**.

If you wish to escape poverty, diligently practice the Three Contemplations. If you wish to escape arrogance, learn of the Six Stages.

Cultivating inner contemplation of mind, one has Dharma wealth. With correct faith and external hearing, there is no more arrogance. With the eye of wisdom illuminating what is heard, one fully benefits. How could one not contemplate and understand?

### Section 7: Reconciling Differences

This section harmonizes the Five-Chapter system with the Four Siddhāntas.

#### The Four Siddhāntas and the Five Chapters

**Q:** The Buddha's teaching depends on the Four Siddhāntas. Does our present interpretation of the Five Meanings accord with those?

**A:** This meaning shall now be explained. First, we correlate [the Four Siddhāntas] with the Five Chapters; next, we explain the Four Siddhāntas.

**Worldly Siddhānta** corresponds to **Interpreting the Name**. The Name encompasses the entire text; the Worldly likewise crowns the [other] three.

**First-Principle Siddhānta** corresponds to **Substance**—this is most clear.

**For-Each-Person Siddhānta** corresponds to **Essence**. The Essence discusses cause and effect; "For-Each-Person" generates good—the meaning is the same.

**Therapeutic Siddhānta** corresponds to **Function**. Function breaks through doubt and stagnation; treating illness is its equivalent.

**Teaching Classification** corresponds to **distinguishing the Siddhāntas**, as explained later.

The Five-Chapter exegesis accommodates both sharp and dull; the Four Siddhāntas are presented specifically for duller roots—matching in meaning but differing in sequence.

#### What Are the Four Siddhāntas?

Master Nanyue, following the example of "*Mahāparinirvāṇa*," used both Sanskrit and Chinese together. "Xī" is Chinese [meaning "universal"]; "tán" is Sanskrit [*dāna*, meaning "giving"]. "Xī" means "universally"; "tán" translates as "giving." The Buddha universally gives four dharmas to sentient beings—hence the term *siddhānta*.

**1. Worldly Siddhānta**

The world is like a cart: wheels, spokes, axle, and rim combine to give rise to "cart"—there is no separate cart. The five aggregates combine to give rise to "person"—there is no separate person.

The existence of the five aggregates, twelve bases, and eighteen realms, with all their names and marks separately distinguished—this is called "world."

The Great Sage, following what sentient beings delight to hear, distinctly teaches the Dharma of correct causation and world—enabling them to gain correct worldly views. This is the mark of the Worldly Siddhānta.

**2. For-Each-Person Siddhānta**

The Great Sage observes people's minds and teaches accordingly. People's minds differ; regarding one matter, some listen and some do not.

The secondary purpose is to break attachments; the primary purpose is to generate faith, increase good roots, and bestow wholesome dharmas. Hence it is called the "For-Each-Person" Siddhānta.

**3. Therapeutic Siddhānta**

There are dharmas that exist as treatment but have no inherent nature. Treatment means: for excessive greed, teach contemplation of impurity; for excessive anger, teach cultivation of loving-kindness; for excessive delusion, teach contemplation of causation.

Treating evil diseases, teaching this Dharma medicine, universally giving to sentient beings—this is the mark of the Therapeutic Siddhānta.

**4. First-Principle Siddhānta**

There are two kinds: (1) the inexpressible; (2) the expressible.

The inexpressible is what all Buddhas, pratyekabuddhas, and arhats realize as Reality-Mark. A verse says: "Speech and discourse come to an end; mental activity also ceases. Neither arising nor ceasing—the Dharma is like nirvāṇa."

Teaching where activities proceed is called "world." Teaching where [activities] do not proceed is called "First-Principle."

Regarding the expressible: "All is real," "All is unreal," "All is both real and unreal," "All is neither real nor unreal"—these are all names for the True Mark of all dharmas.[^37]

Therefore the *Madhyamaka-śāstra* says: "For one who is heading toward the Way, explain the four phrases; like a swift horse seeing the shadow of the whip, they immediately enter the correct path."

But if upon hearing the four phrases, the mind gives rise to grasping—this is all idle talk. How is this the First-Principle?

### The Four Siddhāntas Explained in Ten Methods

Master Zhiyi presents a comprehensive analysis of the Four Siddhāntas through ten methodological lenses:

1.  **Explaining the Names**
2.  **Distinguishing the Marks**
3.  **Interpreting the Establishment**
4.  **Correlating with the Truths**
5.  **Generating Contemplation and Teaching**
6.  **Holy Speech and Holy Silence**
7.  **Application and Non-Application**
8.  **Provisional and Real**
9.  **Opening the Provisional to Reveal the Real**
10. **Connecting with the Sūtra**

#### Section 4: Correlating with the Four Noble Truths

**Correlating with the Truths:** Directly correlating one set of Four Noble Truths, as previously explained.

More extensively correlating the Four Kinds of Four Noble Truths: each of the four kinds is correlated with the Four Siddhāntas.

In summary correlation:
- **Arising-and-Ceasing Four Truths** correspond to the **Worldly Siddhānta**
- **Non-Arising Four Truths** correspond to the **For-Each-Person Siddhānta**
- **Immeasurable Four Truths** correspond to the **Therapeutic Siddhānta**
- **Non-Created Four Truths** correspond to the **First-Principle Siddhānta**[^38]

#### Section 5: Generating Contemplation and Teaching

**Contemplation Arises Through the Siddhāntas**

Profound and subtle principle cannot be illuminated without contemplation. Contemplation that accords with principle cannot arise without the Siddhāntas.

When cultivating the contemplation of **entering emptiness from the provisional**, first contemplate the dharmas of correct dependent origination.

These dharmas—inner and outer, intimate and distant—are separately distinguished. If there is no earnestness and delight, the practice will not succeed. One must diligently strive day and night with joy and without laxity. **This is the Worldly Siddhānta generating initial contemplation.**

If one wishes to contemplate entering emptiness from the provisional, one must recognize what is expedient for each person. This is following what is appropriate; the wholesome mind then arises.

If there is the disease of **sinking** or **floating**, one must use the **Therapeutic Siddhānta**:
- When the mind **sinks**: treat with mindfulness, discrimination, vigor, and joy.
- When the mind **floats**: treat with mindfulness, equanimity, exclusion, and concentration.[^39]

If one skillfully employs [the For-Each-Person Siddhānta], good roots become thick. If one skillfully employs the Therapeutic [Siddhānta], afflictions become thin.

Among the Seven Factors of Awakening, following one factor, suddenly [insight arises] as if lost [to ordinary awareness]. Relying on this factor of awakening for research and cultivation, one can generate true illumination and see the First-Principle.

**This is using the Four Siddhāntas to generate the contemplation of entering emptiness from the provisional, accomplishing all-knowledge, and opening the Wisdom Eye.**

If [cultivating] the contemplation of **entering the provisional from emptiness**, skillfully employ the Four Siddhāntas to attain Path-Knowledge—the Dharma Eye is likewise.

If cultivating the **Middle First-Principle Contemplation**, skillfully employ the Four Siddhāntas to attain All-Mode-Knowledge—the Buddha Eye is likewise.

If [practicing] **Three Contemplations in One Mind**, the skillful application is likewise.

**Teaching Arises Through the Siddhāntas**

**Generating Teaching:** The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* says: "The Buddha constantly delights in silence; he does not delight in teaching the Dharma." The *Vimalakīrti* also discusses closing the mouth. This sūtra says: "It cannot be proclaimed with words."

The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "The arising of arising cannot be spoken; from that down to the non-arising of non-arising cannot be spoken." Yet it also says: "It can also be spoken."

If sentient beings formed by the ten-factor dependent origination have **lower-grade delight**, able to generate phenomenal good within the realms, with crude methods breaking delusion and analyzing dharmas to enter emptiness—for those possessing these conditions, the Tathāgata turns the Dharma Wheel of the **Arising-and-Ceasing Four Truths**, generating the **Tripiṭaka Teaching**.

If sentient beings have **middle-grade delight**, the Tathāgata turns the Dharma Wheel of the **Non-Arising Four Truths**, generating the **Shared Teaching**.

If sentient beings have **upper-grade delight**, the Tathāgata turns the Dharma Wheel of the **Immeasurable Four Truths**, generating the **Distinct Teaching**.

If sentient beings have **highest-grade delight**, the Tathāgata turns the Dharma Wheel of the **Non-Created Four Truths**, generating the **Perfect Teaching**.

#### Section 6: Holy Speech and Holy Silence

The *Suvikrāntavikrāmi-paripṛcchā* says: "The Buddha told the monks: 'You should practice two things—either holy speech of Dharma, or holy silence.'"

Holy speech has been explained above. **Holy silence**: The four kinds of Four Noble Truths are all dharmas realized by the Three Vehicle sages, not known by lower ordinary beings. Therefore they cannot be spoken. Even if spoken, it is like setting up a candle for blind people—what benefit is there for those without eyes?

Therefore, since it cannot be spoken, it is called **holy silence**.

**Forms of Holy Silence in Each Teaching**

In the *Avataṃsaka*, counting worlds—unspeakable, unspeakable—clarifies that principle at its ultimate is unspeakable, unspeakable.

In the *Tripiṭaka*, the monk Kauṇḍinya first attained true knowledge and vision—silent, without sound or letters.

Śāriputra said: "I have heard that within liberation, there is no verbal expression." This clarifies, based on the Arising-and-Ceasing Four Truths of the arising-of-arising dharmas, that [it] cannot be spoken.

In the *Vimalakīrti*, [he] shuts his mouth. In the *Mahāsaṃnipāta*, the Bodhisattva of No Speech says: "The path of speech is cut off; mental activity also ceases. Neither arising nor ceasing—the Dharma is like nirvāṇa."

This sūtra clarifies: "**Stop, stop—no need to speak. My Dharma is wonderful and hard to conceive.**" "**This Dharma cannot be shown; the marks of speech are extinguished.**" It cannot be proclaimed with words; it is not something that thought or discrimination can comprehend.

This clarifies, based on the Non-Created Four Truths of non-arising-of-non-arising dharmas, that [it] cannot be spoken. Because it cannot be spoken, it is called **holy silence**.

#### Section 7: Application and Non-Application

The Four Siddhāntas—only the Tathāgata has completely and ultimately attained them and can subtly employ them. From lower stages onward, attainment and application differ. There are four possibilities:

1. **Not attaining, not applying**
2. **Attaining but not applying**
3. **Not attaining yet applying**
4. **Both attaining and applying**

**Who Falls into Each Category**

Ordinary beings and non-Buddhists revolve in suffering and accumulation—they cannot even know the names of the Four Siddhāntas. Who speaks of their attainment? Since they do not attain, how can they apply?

If the Two Vehicles of the Tripiṭaka Teaching diligently practice themselves—knowing suffering, cutting off accumulation, cultivating the path, realizing cessation, entering truth—this is also called **attainment**. But they do not ferry sentient beings, so they **cannot apply**.

If they were to apply, they would misjudge readiness.

Like Pūrṇa, who for ninety days tried to convert the non-Buddhists but was instead ridiculed! When Mañjuśrī briefly went, both teacher and disciples submitted. **This is not knowing delight—being unable to use the Worldly Siddhānta.**

Like Śāriputra teaching two disciples—good roots did not arise; instead, wrong doubts increased. **This is being unable to use the For-Each-Person Siddhānta.**

Like the five hundred arhats teaching the Four Truths to Kātyāyana—there was no benefit at all. The Buddha taught him the impurity contemplation, and immediately evil was broken. **This is being unable to use the Therapeutic Siddhānta.**

Like Śāriputra not ferrying Puṇyavardhana—the great physician did not treat; the small physicians folded their hands. The five hundred all failed to ferry him; the Buddha ferried him and immediately he attained arhatship. **This is being unable to use the First-Principle Siddhānta.**

Pratyekabuddhas are the same—**attaining but unable to apply**.

In the **Tripiṭaka Teaching**, bodhisattvas know suffering, accumulation, path, and cessation, but only suppress afflictions and have not yet realized cessation. They have not fully attained, yet can apply—like a guide who ferries others while still on this shore. In the **Shared Teaching**, the Two Vehicles are the same as in Tripiṭaka; bodhisattvas from the first to sixth grounds both attain and apply, though not skillfully, while at the seventh ground their application becomes stronger.

**Progression Through the Teachings**

In the Distinct Teaching at the Ten Abidings, one only attains the two kinds—analytic and embodied—of Four Siddhāntas, but cannot yet apply them. At the Ten Practices, one can apply. At the Ten Dedications, one progressively attains the resemblance Four Siddhāntas and can also apply in resemblance. Entering the Stages, one partially-truly attains and partially-truly applies.

In the Perfect Teaching, disciples at the Five Stages of Discipleship cannot yet attain or apply. At the Purification of the Six Senses, one attains and applies in resemblance. At the First Abiding, one partially-truly attains and applies. **Only the Buddha ultimately attains and ultimately applies.**

#### Section 8: Provisional and Real

**Provisional and Real:** That each of the Four Noble Truths distinguishes Four Siddhāntas—this is the general approach.

The *Śāstra* says: "Many sūtras speak of three Siddhāntas, not speaking of the First-Principle"—this refers to the Tripiṭaka.

Even so, this is ultimately a crude method, **provisionally matching lesser readiness**.

If the Shared Teaching's Four Truths clarify the Four Siddhāntas, embodying dharmas as directly true—the gate is skillful, yet **it still belongs to the Provisional**.

If the Distinct Teaching's Four Truths clarify the Four Siddhāntas, based on the Middle—this meaning is deep. Yet it is still sequential; distinct marks are not yet fused. The teaching-path is Provisional—**this is not yet Wonderful**.

Now, the Perfect Teaching's Four Truths clarifying the Four Siddhāntas—their marks are perfectly fused. This is the **most Real explanation**. Therefore the Four Siddhāntas are **Real** and **Wonderful**.

**The Five Flavors and Provisional/Real**

If we apply this Provisional/Real to the Five Flavor Teachings:

| Teaching | Provisional? | Real? |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| **Milk (Avataṃsaka)** | 4 Provisional | 4 Real |
| **Curds (Tripiṭaka)** | 4 Provisional only | — |
| **Fresh Butter (Vaipulya)** | 12 Provisional | 4 Real |
| **Clarified Butter (Prajñā)** | 8 Provisional | 4 Real |
| **Ghee (Lotus)** | — | **All 4 Real** |

#### Section 9: Opening the Provisional to Reveal the Real

All dharmas without exception are all Wonderful. **One form, one fragrance—none is not the Middle.** It is only that sentient beings' feelings are cut off from the Wonderful.

Great Compassion follows beings and does not contend with the world. Therefore [the Buddha] clarifies the various Provisional and Real as different.

Therefore the *Sūtra of Immeasurable Meanings* says: "For more than forty years, the Three Dharmas, Four Fruits, and Two Paths did not unite." "Now [I] open the gate of skillful means and reveal the Reality-Mark." "Only for the One Great Matter as cause and condition—[I] teach only the unsurpassed Way." "Opening the Buddha's knowledge and vision, causing all to enter ultimate Reality-Mark."

Eliminating the Conjured City—this is **determining the coarse**. All reaching the Treasure Site—this is **entering the Wonderful**.

If the four Wonderful [teachings] of the Milk Teaching—these are not different from today's Wonderful. Only their four Provisional [teachings] are determined to enter today's Wonderful.

Determining the four Provisional of the Curds Teaching, the twelve Provisional of the Fresh Butter Teaching, the eight Provisional of the Clarified Butter Teaching—all can enter the Wonderful.

Therefore the text says: "**The twelve hundred arhats shall all become Buddhas.**"

And: "**Decisively understanding the Śrāvaka Dharma—this is the King of all Sūtras. Having heard and carefully reflected, one approaches the unsurpassed Way.**"

**Opening the Provisional to reveal the Real**—the meaning lies here.

#### Section 10: Connecting with the Sūtra

**Q:** Now we connect the Four Siddhāntas with this sūtra. What text in this sūtra clarifies the Four Siddhāntas?

**A:** Throughout the text, this meaning is everywhere; I cannot cite it all. Now I briefly cite two passages from the Trace and Fundamental [teachings].

**From the "Skillful Means" Chapter (Trace Teaching)**

The "Skillful Means" chapter says: "Knowing the various practices of sentient beings, what their deep minds contemplate, the karmas of past cultivation, their desires, natures, vigor and power, and whether their faculties are sharp or dull—with various causes and conditions, similes and also words, [I] teach according to appropriate skillful means."[^40]

Is this not the language of the Four Siddhāntas?

- **Desires** is delight—the **Worldly Siddhānta**.
- **Natures** is the nature of wisdom—the **For-Each-Person Siddhānta**.
- **Vigor and power** is breaking evil—the **Therapeutic Siddhānta**.
- **Faculties sharp or dull** is two people attaining awakening differently—the **First-Principle Siddhānta**.

**From the "Lifespan" Chapter (Fundamental Teaching)**

The "Lifespan" chapter says: "The Tathāgata clearly sees without error. Because sentient beings have various natures, various desires, various practices, and various recollections and discriminations—wishing to cause them to generate various good roots, with numerous causes and conditions, similes, and words, [I] teach the Dharma in various ways. The Buddha's work is never even momentarily suspended."[^41]

- **Various natures** is the **For-Each-Person** [Siddhānta].
- **Various desires** is the **Worldly** [Siddhānta].
- **Various practices** is the **Therapeutic** [Siddhānta].
- **Various recollections and discriminations** is inferring principle, transforming wrong recollection, and seeing the **First-Principle**.

In both passages, the four meanings are complete; both speak of teaching the Dharma for sentient beings. **Is this not clear evidence that the Four Siddhāntas establish the teaching?**

[^37]: This is the famous *catuṣkoṭi* (tetralemma) of Mādhyamika logic, used by Nāgārjuna: (1) X, (2) not-X, (3) both X and not-X, (4) neither X nor not-X. All four can be skillfully employed to point toward Reality-Mark.

[^38]: The **Four Kinds of Four Noble Truths** are a distinctively Tiantai classification: (1) Arising-and-Ceasing — Tripiṭaka; (2) Non-Arising — Shared; (3) Immeasurable — Distinct; (4) Non-Created — Perfect. Each teaching has its own version of the Four Noble Truths.

[^39]: These are the **Seven Factors of Awakening** (*saptabodhyaṅga*): mindfulness, discrimination, vigor, joy, tranquility, concentration, and equanimity. Master Zhiyi divides them into groups for treating mental sinking (torpor) and floating (restlessness).
