**Scholarly Translation by The Architect**

### Introduction to the Detailed Interpretation

**Fourth, the correct discussion of the present meaning** has two parts: first, briefly using those names to reveal the wonderful meaning.

#### The Three Meanings of Cause

**Cause possesses three meanings:**

1.  One Dharma-Realm contains the nine Dharma-Realms—this is called **breadth of substance**.
2.  The nine Dharma-Realms are precisely the Buddha Dharma-Realm—this is called **height of position**.
3.  The Ten Dharma-Realms are precisely emptiness, precisely provisional, precisely the Middle—this is called **length of function**.

Discussing three in terms of one, discussing one in terms of three—neither separately different, nor horizontal, nor singular—therefore it is called **Wonderful**.

#### The Three Meanings of Fruit

**The substance of fruit has three meanings:**
*   Substance pervades all places—**breadth of substance**.
*   [The Buddha] has long since attained Buddhahood, remote in time—**height of position**.
*   From the Fundamental, the Trace descends; past, present, and future—benefiting beings in the three times—**length of function**.

These are the **six meanings of cause and effect**, different from other sūtras. Therefore it is called **Wonderful**.

### The Five Flavors and Cause/Effect

In the **Milk Teaching** (*Avataṃsaka*), one kind of cause-and-effect is broad, high, and long; one kind is narrow, low, and short—thus one coarse, one wonderful.[^1]

In the **Curds Teaching** (*Tripiṭaka*), there is only one kind of cause-and-effect: narrow, low, and short—only coarse, no wonderful.

In the **Fresh Butter Teaching** (*Vaipulya*), three kinds are narrow, low, short; one kind is broad, high, long—thus three coarse, one wonderful.

In the **Clarified Butter Teaching** (*Prajñā*), two kinds are narrow, low, short; one kind is broad, high, long—thus two coarse, one wonderful.

In the **Ghee Teaching** (*Lotus*), there is one kind of cause-and-effect: broad, high, and long—**only wonderful, no coarse**.

Moreover, in the Ghee Teaching, the wonderful cause and wonderful fruit do not differ from the wonderful cause and fruit of other teachings—therefore it is called **Wonderful**.

### Observing the Mind

**Furthermore, the interpretation through Observing the Mind:** If one contemplates one's own mind and [finds that] it does not contain the minds of sentient beings and the Buddha-mind, this is **narrow substance**. If it contains them, this is **broad substance**.

If one's own mind is not equal to the Buddha-mind, this is **low position**. If equal to the Buddha-mind, this is **high position**.

If one's own mind, sentient beings' minds, and the Buddha-mind are not precisely empty, precisely provisional, precisely the Middle, this is **short function**. If they are precisely empty, precisely provisional, precisely the Middle, this is **long function**.

#### The Four Unities

Furthermore, penetrating the Ten Dharma-Realms and the Six Stages of Identity within one Dharma-Realm—this is also breadth of substance, height of position, and length of function.

*   First, in terms of the Ten Dharma-Realms—this reveals **unity of principle**.
*   Second, in terms of the Five Flavors—this is **unity of teaching**.
*   Third, in terms of Observing the Mind—this is **unity of practice**.
*   Fourth, in terms of the Six Stages—this is **unity of person**.

This completes the summary demonstration of the wonderful meaning.

### The Three Wonderful Dharmas

**Extensive explanation:** First the dharmas, then the Wonderful. Master Nanyue raised three kinds: **Sentient Being Dharma**, **Buddha Dharma**, and **Mind Dharma**.

As the sūtra says: "In order to cause sentient beings to open, reveal, awaken to, and enter the Buddha's knowledge and vision." If sentient beings had no Buddha-knowledge-and-vision, what would there be to discuss opening? Therefore know: **the Buddha's knowledge and vision is stored within sentient beings**.[^2]

#### 1. Sentient Being Dharma Is Wonderful

The sūtra says: "With only the eyes born from one's parents"—this is the **fleshly eye**. "Thoroughly seeing both inside and outside Mount Sumeru"—this is the **heavenly eye**. Seeing all forms without attachment—this is the **wisdom eye**. Seeing forms without error—this is the **Dharma eye**. Though one has not yet attained the outflows, the eye-faculty is purified. If this one eye possesses the functions of all eyes—this is the **Buddha eye**.

This present sūtra uses this to clarify that **Sentient Being Dharma is Wonderful**.

The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "Those who study the Great Vehicle, though they have fleshly eyes, are called [to have] Buddha eyes. The ear, nose, and five faculties are also thus."

The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā* says: "The six sovereign kings—because their nature is pure." And: "All dharmas tend toward the eye; this tending does not surpass [the eye]."[^3]

This is how the various sūtras clarify that **Sentient Being Dharma is Wonderful**.

**CBETA sequence note:** Zhiyi orders the proofs as (1) *Lotus* eye‑passages, (2) *Mahāparinirvāṇa* eye‑language, (3) *Mahāprajñā* “all dharmas tend toward the eye,” before moving to Buddha‑Dharma and Mind‑Dharma.

#### 2. Buddha Dharma Is Wonderful

**Buddha Dharma is Wonderful:** As the sūtra says: "Stop, stop—no need to speak. My Dharma is wonderful and hard to conceive."

The Buddha's Dharma does not go beyond the Provisional and Real. "This Dharma is extremely profound and wonderful, hard to see and hard to comprehend. Among all classes of sentient beings, none can know the Buddha"—this is the **wonderfulness of Real Wisdom**.

"And the Buddha's other dharmas—none can fathom them either"—this is the **wonderfulness of the Buddha's Provisional Wisdom**.

These two dharmas—only a Buddha and a Buddha can fully fathom the Reality-Mark of all dharmas. This is called **Buddha Dharma is Wonderful**.

#### 3. Mind Dharma Is Wonderful

**Mind Dharma is Wonderful:** As in the "Peaceful Practices" [chapter], one cultivates and controls the mind, contemplating all dharmas—unmoved, unretreating. And "a single thought of rejoicing," etc.

The *Samantabhadra Contemplation* says: "My mind is itself empty; sins and merits have no master." "Contemplating the mind, there is no mind; dharmas do not abide in dharmas." And: "The mind is purely the Dharma."

The *Vimalakīrti* says: "Contemplating the body's Reality-Mark—contemplating the Buddha is also thus. The liberation of all Buddhas should be sought within the mental activities of sentient beings."

The *Avataṃsaka* says: "**Mind, Buddha, and sentient beings—these three are without difference.**" "**Breaking open the atom of the mind, there emerge sūtra-scrolls of the great-thousand [world].**"[^4]

This is called **Mind Dharma is Wonderful**.

### The Ten Suchnesses

Sūtras and śāstras sometimes clarify that one dharma encompasses all dharmas—this is **Mind**: "In the three realms there are no separate dharmas; they are only made by one mind."

**This present sūtra uses ten dharmas to encompass all dharmas:** "The so-called dharmas: suchness of mark, suchness of nature, suchness of substance, suchness of power, suchness of function, suchness of cause, suchness of condition, suchness of effect, suchness of retribution, suchness of ultimate equality from beginning to end."[^5]

Master Nanyue read all [ten items] in this text as "*ru*" ("suchness")—hence they are called the **Ten Suchnesses**.

#### Master Zhiyi's Threefold Reading

**Master Tiantai said:** "Reading the text according to meaning, there are altogether **three turns**."

**First:** "The mark is suchness, the nature is suchness, through the retribution is suchness."

**Second:** "Suchness of mark, suchness of nature, through suchness of retribution."

**Third:** "The mark is thus, the nature is thus, through the retribution is thus."

#### The Three Truths in the Three Readings

If all are called "suchness"—the name "suchness" is not different—this is the meaning of **Emptiness**.

If read as "suchness of mark, suchness of nature," pointing out empty marks and natures with conventional designations, each proceeding differently—this is the meaning of the **Provisional**.

If read as "the mark is thus"—"thus" being the Reality-Mark of the Middle—this is the meaning of the **Middle**.

#### Emptiness, Provisional, and Middle Are Mutually Inclusive

For easy understanding, we distinguish Emptiness, Provisional, and Middle. But grasping the meaning: **Emptiness is precisely Provisional and Middle.**

From "suchness," clarify Emptiness—**one emptiness is all emptiness**. Pointing to "suchness," clarify marks—**one provisional is all provisional**. In terms of "thus," discuss the Middle—**one Middle is all Middle**. Neither one, two, three, yet one, two, three. Neither vertical nor horizontal—this is called **Reality-Mark**.

**Only a Buddha and a Buddha can fathom this dharma.**

These **ten dharmas encompass all dharmas**.

### The Ten Dharma-Realms

Now to clarify Provisional and Real: the Ten Suchnesses in terms of the **Ten Dharma-Realms**—the Six Destinies and the Four Sagely [realms].

All are called "Dharma-Realms"—the meaning has three aspects:

1.  All ten numbers depend on the Dharma-Realm; outside the Dharma-Realm there are no other dharmas. Combining agent and object—hence "Ten Dharma-Realms."
2.  These ten kinds of dharmas differ in their divisions; cause and effect are separately distinguished; ordinary and sagely are different—hence "realm" is added.
3.  All ten are precisely the Dharma-Realm, encompassing all dharmas. All dharmas tend toward hell—the tending does not surpass [hell]. The very substance is principle; there is nothing further to depend on—hence "Dharma-Realm."[^6]

### The Hundred Realms and Thousand Suchnesses

One Dharma-Realm possesses ten suchnesses. **Ten Dharma-Realms possess one hundred suchnesses.**

Moreover, one Dharma-Realm contains nine Dharma-Realms—thus there are **one hundred Dharma-Realms** and **one thousand suchnesses**.

Grouped into five categories: (1) Evil, (2) Good, (3) Two Vehicles, (4) Bodhisattva, (5) Buddha. Classified into two dharmas: the first four are **Provisional Dharma**; the last one is **Real Dharma**. In detailed discussion, each contains both Provisional and Real; for now we follow the twofold meaning.

Yet this Provisional and Real is inconceivable—it is the realm of the dual wisdom of the Buddhas of the Three Times.

### The Buddha's Perfect Knowledge

The Tathāgata penetrates thoroughly, fathoming the bottom of the ten dharmas, exhausting the boundaries of the ten dharmas. He clearly recognizes sentient beings: seeded or unseeded, sprouted or unsprouted, ripened or unripened, capable of liberation or incapable—**knowing them as they truly are, without error**.

Aṅgulimāla, though an evil man, had his true-mark nature ripened—he was immediately ferried across. The monk of the Fourth Dhyāna, though a good man, had his evil-nature mark ripened—he was not capable of being ferried.

**Know this: Sentient Being Dharma is inconceivable.** Though Real, yet Provisional; though Provisional, yet Real. Real and Provisional mutually entail each other without obstruction.

One cannot view sentient beings with ox or sheep eyes. One cannot evaluate sentient beings with an ordinary person's mind. Only wisdom like the Tathāgata's can evaluate them. **Why? Because Sentient Being Dharma is Wonderful.**

### The Clarification of "Wonderful"

[This section has] two parts: (1) General interpretation, (2) Particular interpretation.

The general interpretation also has two parts: (1) **Relative**, (2) **Absolute**.

This sūtra discusses only these two kinds of Wonderful; there is no text about "neither absolute nor relative." If we were to posit another [kind], what delusion would it sever? What principle would it reveal? Therefore we do not discuss [a third].

### Section 1: The Relative Wonderful

Guangzhai used the *Lotus Sūtra's* Wonderful to contrast [it] with all previous teachings as coarse. This has great problems, as already critiqued above.

**The present Relative Wonderful:** contrasting the *half-word* [teaching] as coarse, clarifying the *full-word* [teaching] as wonderful. This is also constant/impermanent, great/small mutually contrasted—as coarse and wonderful.[^7]

#### Scriptural Evidence for Relative Wonderful

The *Vimalakīrti* says: "Teaching the Dharma is neither existent nor non-existent; through causes and conditions, all dharmas arise." This clarifies the full-word [teaching]. "First sitting at the Bodhi Tree, with power subduing Māra, attaining the sweet-dew extinction, the *bodhi* path achieved"—this lifts up the former half-word in contrast to manifest the full.

The *Prajñā[pāramitā]* says: "In Jambudvīpa, seeing the second turning of the Dharma wheel." This also contrasts the Deer Park as first, waiting for *Prajñā* as second.

The *Nirvāṇa [Sūtra]* says: "Formerly at Vārāṇasī I first turned the Dharma wheel; now at the city of Kuśinagara I again turn the Dharma wheel."

All sūtras together take the Deer Park as half, as small, as coarse—contrasted with this [later teaching] as full, great, and wonderful. The meaning is the same.

Now the *Lotus* clarifies: "Formerly at Vārāṇasī, [I] turned the Dharma wheel of the Four Noble Truths, the arising and ceasing of the five aggregates. Now I again turn the most wonderful, unsurpassed Dharma wheel." This also contrasts the Deer Park as coarse, the *Lotus* as wonderful. The meaning of "wonderful" is the same; the contrast with "coarse" is also equal. The text and meaning lie here.

#### The Three Teachings All Share This Structure

**Q:** From *Vaipulya* onward, if the full principle is not different, should all be called wonderful?

**A:** We do not precisely fix teachings to times—how can you suddenly speak of "from *Vaipulya*"? Even granting that: there is a separate reason. Sharp-rooted bodhisattvas at that [point] enter the Wonderful no differently from the *Lotus*. Dull-rooted bodhisattvas and Two Vehicle people still carry expedients; the various flavors discipline [them].

*Vaipulya* brings fresh butter in discussing the Wonderful to contrast the coarse. *Prajñā* brings aged butter in discussing the Wonderful to contrast the coarse. **This present sūtra has no two-flavor expedients—pure true ghee discusses the Wonderful to contrast the coarse.** This Wonderful and that Wonderful—the meaning of "wonderful" is not different. The only difference is bringing expedients or not bringing expedients.

#### The Navigation Metaphor

Now we explain with a simile. It is like the government having three ships and also private boats, ferrying people from this shore to the other shore.

The **Milk Teaching** (*Avataṃsaka*) is like large and medium ships, together ferrying people to the other shore.

The **Curds Teaching** (*Tripiṭaka*) is like private boats, ferrying people to a middle island.

The **Fresh Butter** (*Vaipulya*) is like four kinds: small ships and private boats ferry people to the middle island; two ships ferry people to the other shore.

The **Clarified Butter** (*Prajñā*) is like three ships: one ship [goes to] the middle island, two ships to the other shore.

The **Ghee** (*Lotus*) is like a large ship, ferrying people to the other shore.

The three ships are government vessels—hence all are called "full." The private boats are not—hence they are called "half." Among the government vessels, the two [smaller] ships are small, their capacity limited; the large ship is magnificent, carrying many times more—**alone called Wonderful**.

The wise understand through similes; the meaning of the simile is thus.

### Section 2: The Absolute Wonderful

The Absolute Wonderful has four [sub-types]:

#### 2.1 Tripiṭaka Absolute

First: When the three provisional [dharmas] arise following sentient feeling, if one enters the true principle, the contrast is immediately severed. Therefore Śāriputra said: "I have heard that within liberation, there is no verbal expression." **This is the Absolute meaning within the Tripiṭaka.**

#### 2.2 Shared Teaching Absolute

Second: If following the three provisional [dharmas] of principle, all the world is like illusion and transformation; phenomena are precisely truth—no phenomenon is not truth. What further thing would one contrast as "not true"? Compared to the Tripiṭaka, this "absolute" still is not absolute. **Phenomena precisely being truth—this is absolute.** This is the **Shared Teaching Absolute**.

#### 2.3 Distinct Teaching Absolute

Third: When the Distinct Teaching arises, compared to the "phenomena precisely truth" absolute, [that teaching] is still conventional truth. Why? [Because] it is not the Great Nirvāṇa; it is still the conventional truth of birth-and-death—the absolute still has relativity. **If one enters the Distinct Teaching's Middle, then the relative is severed!**

#### 2.4 Perfect Teaching Absolute

Fourth: **When the Perfect Teaching arises, teaching the dharma of no-discrimination**—the extreme is precisely the Middle; nothing is not Buddha-dharma; quiescent and pure. How could Buddha-dharma further contrast Buddha-dharma? Because of the Tathāgata's Dharma-Realm, outside the Dharma-Realm there is no further dharma that can be compared. **Whom would one contrast as coarse? Compared to whom would one be wonderful? There is nothing to contrast with, nor anything to sever.** We do not know what to call it—we forcibly speak of it as "absolute."

#### The *Nirvāṇa Sūtra* on the Great

The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "**The name 'Great' cannot be weighed or measured; it is inconceivable—hence called 'Great.'** It is like empty space: it is not called 'great' because of small space. Nirvāṇa is also thus; it is not called 'Great Nirvāṇa' because of lesser marks." **Wonderful is also thus: "Wonderful" cannot be conceived; it is not called "Wonderful" because of [contrast with] the coarse.**

#### The Lotus Sutra on Inexpressibility

If one claims there is definitely a Dharma-Realm that is vast and uniquely absolute, then this "great" would have something to possess—how would it be "absolute"? **The Dharma-Realm is now pure—not seeing, hearing, awareness, or cognition—it cannot be spoken or shown.**

The text says: "**Stop, stop—no need to speak. My Dharma is wonderful and hard to conceive.**" "Stop, stop—no need to speak"—this is **severance of speech**. "My Dharma is wonderful and hard to conceive"—this is **severance of thought**.

And: "**This Dharma cannot be shown; the marks of words are extinguished.**" This is also text of absolute wonder. It cannot be shown through relativity, cannot be shown through absoluteness—eliminating relativity, eliminating absoluteness—hence "extinguished."

And: "**All dharmas constantly have the mark of extinction; they finally return to emptiness.**" This emptiness is also empty—then there is no more relativity or absoluteness.

#### The Middle Neither Arises nor Produces Arising

The *Madhyamaka-śāstra* says: "**If a dharma is established through relativity, that dharma in turn establishes relativity.**" Now there is no cause of relativity, nor anything established. The *Lotus* opening says: "**Having attained the patience of non-arising, one also does not give rise to non-arising.**" Non-arising is precisely non-arising—**this is called Absolute Wonderful**.

#### Warning Against Further Proliferation

Beyond this, if one were to posit further [categories], what would one sever? What principle would one reveal? Wandering endlessly, one would fall into idle talk. This is confused feeling making discriminations—"absolute" not absolute, "neither absolute nor relative" contrasting "both relative and absolute"—words chasing words, never absolute!

Why? Words arise from investigation and discrimination; if mental deliberation does not cease, how could words be severed? It is like a **foolish dog chasing a clod**—tiring itself in vain; the clods never end. If one can wonderfully awaken within the realm, ceasing the wind of investigation and discrimination, the water of mind becomes clear—words and thoughts are both severed. It is like a **clever lion that releases the clod and chases the person**—the source of clods having been removed, the clods are then severed![^8]

### The Ten Trace Subtleties

The particular interpretation of "Wonderful" has three parts. Within the Trace, there is Sentient Being Dharma Wonderful, Buddha Dharma Wonderful, and Mind Dharma Wonderful—each has ten layers, totaling thirty layers.

**The Ten Trace Subtleties are:**

1.  **Realm Subtlety**
2.  **Wisdom Subtlety**
3.  **Practice Subtlety**
4.  **Position Subtlety**
5.  **Three Dharmas Subtlety**
6.  **Resonance Subtlety**
7.  **Supernatural Powers Subtlety**
8.  **Teaching the Dharma Subtlety**
9.  **Retinue Subtlety**
10. **Merit and Benefit Subtlety**

#### Brief Explanations

**Establishing the chapters:**

What is **Realm Subtlety**? The Ten Suchnesses, dependent origination, Four Noble Truths, Three Truths, Two Truths, One Truth, etc. These are what all Buddhas take as their teacher—hence called Realm Subtlety.

**Wisdom Subtlety:** The so-called twenty kinds of wisdom. Because the realm is subtle, wisdom follows as subtle.

**Practice Subtlety:** The numerical practices, sequential five practices, non-sequential five practices. Because wisdom guides practice, it is called Practice Subtlety.

**Position Subtlety:** The three-grass positions, two-wood positions, one-real position. What subtle practice realizes—hence called Position Subtlety.[^9]

**Three Dharmas Subtlety:** The combined three dharmas, vertical three dharmas, horizontal three dharmas, neither-vertical-nor-horizontal three dharmas, analogically-pervading three dharmas. All are the secret treasury—hence called subtle.

**Resonance Subtlety:** Water does not rise; the moon does not descend. One moon simultaneously manifests in all waters. The Buddhas do not come; sentient beings do not go. Through the power of compassionate roots, one sees such things—hence called Resonance Subtlety.

**Supernatural Powers Subtlety:** Karmic powers, cultivated powers, intentional powers, embodying-dharma powers, neutral transformation powers. Whether remote or near, whether seeding or ripening or liberating—all are for the One Vehicle. Hence called Supernatural Powers Subtlety.

**Teaching the Dharma Subtlety:** Teaching the Twelve Divisions of scripture, lesser teachings, greater teachings, matching-conditions teachings, what is expressed, the perfect and subtle dharma. Teaching completely in accord with principle, causing all sentient beings to open, reveal, awaken to, and enter the Buddha's knowledge and vision—hence called Teaching Subtlety.

**Retinue Subtlety:** Karmic retinue, supernatural-power retinue, vow retinue, responsive retinue, dharma-gate retinue. Like cloudy sky surrounding the moon, like ministers and nobility surrounding [the king]—hence called Retinue Subtlety.

**Merit and Benefit Subtlety:** Fruit-benefits, cause-benefits, emptiness-benefits, provisional-benefits, middle-benefits, transformation-benefits. Like the great ocean able to receive dragon-rain—hence called Merit and Benefit Subtlety.

#### The Arising of the Ten Subtleties

**The arising [of the Ten Subtleties]:** The realm of Reality-Mark is not made by Buddha, devas, or humans—it originally exists of itself; it is not [created] just now. Therefore it is placed first.

Due to confusion about principle, delusion arises; due to understanding principle, wisdom arises. Wisdom is the root of practice. Because of wisdom's eyes, practice's feet arise. Eyes, feet, and realm—these three dharmas become the vehicle. Riding on this vehicle, one enters the cool pond and ascends the various positions.

What do the positions abide in? They abide in the **secret treasury of the three dharmas**.

Having abided in this dharma, it still constantly illuminates, illuminating the readiness of the ten Dharma-Realms—when readiness comes, there must be response.

If responding to readiness and bestowing response, first using the body-wheel—supernatural powers startle and awaken. Having seen the transformations, [beings] are capable of receiving the Way. Then using the mouth-wheel, [the Buddha] proclaims and guides. Having been moistened by the Dharma rain, receiving teaching and the Way, they become Dharma retinue. The retinue practices, uprooting the root of birth-and-death, opening the Buddha's knowledge and vision, attaining great benefit.

**The first five [subtleties] are in terms of self—cause and fruit are complete. The last five are in terms of others—the able and what is enabled are complete.** Though the dharmas are immeasurable, the meaning of the ten is complete. Self and other, beginning and end—all are exhaustively complete.

### The Extensive Interpretation of Realm

The extensive interpretation of Realm has two parts: (1) Interpreting the [six] realms, (2) Discussing the sameness and difference of the realms.

**Interpreting the Realm has six [categories]:**
1.  **Ten Suchnesses Realm**
2.  **Dependent Origination Realm**
3.  **Four Noble Truths Realm**
4.  **Two Truths Realm**
5.  **Three Truths Realm**
6.  **One Truth Realm**

#### On the Sequence

The various sūtras respond to conditions, clarifying realms in great number—how could we exhaustively record them? We briefly raise six kinds.

**The sequence of the six:** The Ten Suchnesses are spoken in this sūtra, hence placed first. Next, the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination—cyclic existence through three times, originally complete. The Tathāgata appeared in the world, skillfully distinguishing and revealing [them], and the name "Four Noble Truths" arose. Moving from extensive to concise, we next analyze the Two Truths. The language of Two Truths is comprehensive; to separately reveal the Middle, we next clarify the Three Truths. The Three Truths still carry expedients; to directly reveal the Real, we next clarify the One Truth. The One Truth still has name and marks; [beyond this] we clarify No-Truth. Beginning from ignorance, ending at the Real Limit—brief use of six kinds suffices.

### 1. The Ten Suchnesses Realm

Already explained above.

### 2. The Dependent Origination Realm

This has four parts: (1) Direct interpretation, (2) Judging coarse and subtle, (3) Opening the coarse to reveal the subtle, (4) Mind contemplation.

#### Direct Interpretation

The direct interpretation has four [types]:

1.  **Conceivable Arising-and-Ceasing** Twelve Links
2.  **Conceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing** Twelve Links
3.  **Inconceivable Arising-and-Ceasing** Twelve Links
4.  **Inconceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing** Twelve Links

**Type 1: Conceivable Arising-and-Ceasing**

The two conceivable types of dependent origination are for sharp and dull roots, discussing dharmas within the [three] realms. The *Madhyamaka-śāstra* says: "For dull-rooted disciples, [we] teach the arising-and-ceasing marks of the twelve links."

This distinguishes [Buddhism] from non-Buddhists. Non-Buddhists wrongly claim that dharmas arise from Īśvara, or from world-nature, or from atoms, or from parents, or from no cause—various wrong inferences that do not accord with reason.

**The Painter Simile**

This correct dependent origination differs from wrong views. It is only that past ignorance, in the confused mind, creates various actions, producing the present-life suffering-fruit of the six destinies, good and bad differing.

The *Saddharmasmṛtyupasthāna* says: "A painter distributes five colors, drawing all forms—beautiful and ugly beyond measure." Tracing to the root, they come from the painter's hand. **The differentiation of the six destinies is not made by Īśvara and such; all comes from the one-thought of the ignorant mind.**[^10]

| Grade of Action | Destiny | Color |
|-----------------|---------|-------|
| **Upper evil** | Hell | Black |
| **Middle evil** | Animal | Red |
| **Lower evil** | Hungry ghost | Blue |
| **Lower good** | Asura | Yellow |
| **Middle good** | Human | White |
| **Upper good** | Deva | Purest white |

Know that because ignorance combines with actions, there are the six destinies—name-and-form, six sense-bases, contact, feeling, craving, grasping, becoming, birth, old age, sickness, death, etc.—following upper, middle, and lower, differing in distinction.

**The Wheel of Existence**

Human and heavenly destinies, myriad kinds of suffering and happiness, from birth returning to death, after death being reborn again—**cycling through three times like a spinning wheel of fire**.

Therefore the sūtra says: "There is a river with whirlpools drowning sentient beings; blinded by ignorance, they cannot escape." The sūtra also calls it "twelve mutually pulling and binding," also "twelve-layered city," also "twelve-thorn garden."

These twelve links, ever-newly arising and ceasing, not abiding for a single thought-moment—hence called the **Arising-and-Ceasing Twelve Links**.

**Type 2: Conceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing**

Second, Conceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing Twelve Links: this uses the skillful to break the clumsy. The *Madhyamaka-śāstra* says: "For sharp-rooted disciples, [we] teach the twelve as non-arising-non-ceasing."

**Delusion is like empty space**, up to old-age-and-death being like empty space. Ignorance is like illusion—unobtainable; up to old-age-and-death being like illusion—unobtainable.

The *Suvarṇaprabhāsa* says: "The nature and marks of ignorance originally do not exist; due to false thinking and conditions, they combine to appear."

Created by unwholesome mental fabrication, like a magician at a crossroads conjuring various elephants, horses, ornaments, and people—the foolish consider them real; the wise know they are not real. **Ignorance conjures the six destinies' dependent and proper [retributions]**—know that they originally do not exist; ignorance creates them. It is like knowing that a vine is not a snake—then the fearful mind does not arise; not arising, it does not cease. **This is the Conceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing Twelve Links.**

**Type 3: Inconceivable Arising-and-Ceasing**

Third, Inconceivable Arising-and-Ceasing: breaking the small to clarify the great, teaching dharmas beyond the [three] realms for both sharp and dull roots.

The *Avataṃsaka* says: "**The mind is like a skilled painter, creating various five aggregates. In all the world, nothing is not made by mind.**" The painter is the ignorant mind. All worlds means the ten Dharma-Realms' provisional and real lands, etc.

**Beyond-Realm Dependent Origination**

The **beyond-realm twelve links**: as the *Ratnagotravibhāga* says: "The emptiness-wisdom of Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas fundamentally does not see the Tathāgata's body."

Although the Two Vehicles have the four antidotes of impermanence, etc., in dependence on the Tathāgata's Dharma-body, [their view] is again confused—**because of confusion, it is ignorance**.

**Within the outflow-free realm, there are four kinds of obstruction**: condition, mark, birth, decay.

*   **Condition**: The ground-of-ignorance conditions action.
*   **Mark**: Ignorance together with action becomes cause.
*   **Birth**: The ground-of-ignorance, together with outflow-free karmic cause, gives birth to the **three kinds of mind-made bodies**.
*   **Decay**: The three mind-made bodies condition **inconceivable transformation-death** (transformation-death).[^11]

This is still like the within-realm twelve links, from ignorance to old-age-and-death.

**The Four Imperfections**

That treatise says: "The three mind-made bodies have not yet separated from the defilement of ignorance—not yet attaining ultimate unconditioned **purity**. The subtle conceptual proliferations of ignorance are not yet permanently extinguished—not yet attaining ultimate unconditioned **self**. The accumulation of subtle conceptual proliferations, mental aggregates born from outflow-free karma, are not yet permanently extinguished—not yet attaining unconditioned **bliss**. The defilements of affliction, karma, and birth are not yet ultimately extinguished—not yet realizing the ultimate **permanence** of sweet-dew."

| Obstruction | What's Missing | Pāramitā |
|---|---|---|
| Condition | Great Purity | Purity |
| Mark | Eight-fold Self-Mastery | Self |
| Birth | Great Bliss | Bliss |
| Decay | Unchanging Permanence | Permanence |

**Type 4: Inconceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing**

Fourth, **Inconceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing** Twelve Links: for sharp-rooted people, it manifests principle precisely in phenomena.

The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "**The twelve links of dependent origination are called Buddha-nature.**" Ignorance, craving, and grasping are afflictions; the path of affliction is precisely *bodhi*. *Bodhi* penetrates [them] so there is no more affliction; affliction not existing, there is ultimate purity—**the understanding-cause Buddha-nature**.

Action and becoming are the path of karma—precisely liberation. Liberation is self-mastery—**the conditioning-cause Buddha-nature**.

Name-and-form, old-age-and-death are the path of suffering—suffering is precisely the Dharma-body. The Dharma-body having neither suffering nor [ordinary] happiness is called **Great Bliss**. Neither arising nor ceasing is **permanence**—**the direct-cause Buddha-nature**.

Therefore it says: "Between ignorance and craving—this is the Middle." Ignorance is past; craving is present. **Whether edge or middle, nothing is not Buddha-nature; all is permanence, bliss, self, and purity.** Ignorance neither arises nor ceases. **This is the Inconceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing Twelve Links.**

### 3. The Four Noble Truths Realm

**The Four Types of Four Noble Truths:**
1.  **Arising-and-Ceasing**
2.  **Non-Arising**
3.  **Immeasurable**
4.  **Without-Action**

Their meaning comes from the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*, "Sacred Conduct Chapter," distinguished into four kinds according to partial/complete and phenomenal/principle.

#### 3.1 Arising-and-Ceasing Four Noble Truths

What is called "Arising-and-Ceasing": because confusion about truth is heavy, [this teaching] receives its name from phenomena.

The *Mahāyāna Parinirvāṇa* says: "The aggregates and sense-fields, layered burdens, oppressing and binding—this is **Suffering**. Views and craving, afflictions that can bring future fruit—this is **Accumulation**. Discipline, concentration, wisdom, impermanence, suffering, emptiness, able to remove the root of suffering—this is the **Path**. The offspring-bondage and fruit-bondage of the twenty-five existences cut off—this is **Cessation**."

#### 3.2 Non-Arising Four Noble Truths

"Non-Arising": because confusion about truth is light, [this teaching] receives its name from principle. **Suffering has no mark of oppression; Accumulation has no mark of combination; the Path has no mark of duality; Cessation has no mark of arising.**

The *Mahāyāna Parinirvāṇa* says: "Bodhisattvas understand suffering as non-suffering; therefore there is no suffering yet there is true principle." The [other] three are also thus.

#### 3.3 Immeasurable Four Noble Truths

"Immeasurable": because confusion within [the Middle] is heavy, [this teaching] receives its name from phenomena. **Suffering has immeasurable marks because the fruits of the ten Dharma-Realms differ. Accumulation has immeasurable marks because the five-dwelling afflictions differ. The Path has immeasurable marks because Buddha-dharmas [numerous as] Ganges sands differ. Cessation has immeasurable marks because the *pāramitās* differ.**

The *Mahāyāna Parinirvāṇa* says: "To know the suffering of the aggregates is called middle wisdom. To distinguish that the aggregates have immeasurable marks—this is not known by Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas. In those sūtras, I never spoke of it."

#### 3.4 Without-Action Four Noble Truths

"Without-Action": because confusion within [the Middle] is light, [this teaching] receives its name from principle. **Due to confusion about principle, *bodhi* is affliction—called Accumulation. *Nirvāṇa* is birth-and-death—called Suffering. Due to understanding, affliction is precisely *bodhi*—called the Path. Birth-and-death is precisely *nirvāṇa*—called Cessation.**

Precisely phenomena are the Middle; no thought, no conception, no one creating—hence called "Without-Action."

The *Mahāyāna Parinirvāṇa* says: "Conventional truth is precisely ultimate truth. Through skillful means, following sentient beings, we speak of two truths. Those who transcend the world know it is precisely ultimate truth."

**Summary Table: Four Types of Four Noble Truths**

| Type | Teaching | Suffering | Accumulation | Path | Cessation |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Arising-Ceasing** | Tripiṭaka | Oppression | Afflictions bringing fruit | Discipline, wisdom | Bondage cut |
| **Non-Arising** | Shared | No oppression mark | No combination mark | Non-duality | No arising mark |
| **Immeasurable** | Distinct | Infinite per 10 realms | Five-dwelling afflictions | Ganges sands of dharmas | Various *pāramitās* |
| **Without-Action** | Perfect | Birth-death = Nirvāṇa | *Bodhi* = Affliction | Affliction = *Bodhi* | No one creating |

### 4. The Two Truths Realm

#### The Difficulty of Understanding Two Truths

The Two Truths—their name appears in many sūtras, but their principle is difficult to understand. The world is confused; there have long been great disputes.

The *Subtle Victory Samādhi Sūtra* says: "The Buddha and Mañjuśrī once debated the Two Truths and both fell into hell. At the time of Kāśyapa Buddha, they together resolved their doubts." If even two sages in their causal stage could not understand, how much more [difficult for] ordinary human sentiment forcibly selecting [views]!

#### Three Ways of Speaking Two Truths

We now say it is not so. The various explanations in sūtras and treatises are all the Tathāgata's skillful expedient means, knowing roots and desires, with various differences. Briefly, there are **three different [approaches]**: following feeling, feeling-and-wisdom, and following wisdom.[^12]

#### The Seven Types of Two Truths

**The Seven Types of Two Truths:**

| # | Conventional | Ultimate | Teaching |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Real existence | Real extinction | Tripiṭaka |
| 2 | Illusory existence | Illusory-existence-is-empty | Shared |
| 3 | Illusory existence | Empty-and-not-empty combined | Distinct (entry) |
| 4 | Illusory existence | All dharmas converge on empty-not-empty | Distinct (full) |
| 5 | Illusory + Illusory-empty = Conventional | Not-existent-not-empty | Perfect (entry) |
| 6 | Illusory + Illusory-empty = Conventional | All converge on not-existent-not-empty | Perfect (approaching) |
| 7 | Illusory + Illusory-empty = Conventional | All converge on existent/empty/neither | Perfect (complete) |

**Type 1: Real Existence Two Truths**

**Real Existence Two Truths**: The aggregates, sense-bases, and elements are all real dharmas. What real dharmas constitute, the myriad forms of the world, is called conventional. Through expedient path-cultivation, having extinguished this conventional, one can then realize truth.

The *Prajñāpāramitā* says: "Emptying form, form is empty." Because conventional is extinguished, it is called "emptying form"; not extinguishing form, it is called "form is empty."

"Within sickness there is no medicine; within written words there is no *bodhi*"—all are this meaning.

**Type 2: Illusory Existence Two Truths**

**Illusory Existence Two Truths** refutes the former meaning. Why? When [dharmas] really exist, there is no truth; when existence is extinguished, there is no conventional. The meaning of Two Truths is not established.

If one clarifies illusory existence: illusory existence is conventional; illusory existence being unobtainable—precisely conventional is truth. The *Prajñāpāramitā* says: "**Precisely form is emptiness, precisely emptiness is form.**" Emptiness and form being mutually identical, the meaning of Two Truths is established.

**Type 7: Perfect Teaching Two Truths**

**Perfect Teaching Two Truths** directly teach the inconceivable Two Truths. **Truth is precisely conventional; conventional is precisely truth.** It is like a wish-fulfilling jewel: the jewel likens truth; its function likens conventional. **Precisely the jewel is the function; precisely the function is the jewel—not two yet two, distinguishing truth and conventional.**

Śāriputra said: "The Buddha through various conditions, similes, and skillful words—his mind peaceful as the ocean—I heard and my net of doubt was cut." This is that meaning.

### 5. The Three Truths Realm

Various sūtras fully contain this meaning, but the name comes from the *Yingluo [Jing]* and *Renwang [Jing]*, which speak of: Existent Truth, Non-Existent Truth, and **Middle Ultimate Truth**.[^13]

This present sūtra also contains this meaning. The *Lifespan Chapter* says: "**Neither same nor different**"—this is the Middle. "Same" is truth; "different" is conventional.

#### On Borrowing Terms Between Sūtras

**Q:** If this sūtra does not have the names "four kinds of dependent origination," etc., why use those meanings?

**A:** The "five dwellings" and "two deaths" come from the *Śrīmālā Sūtra*; [by that logic] the *Nirvāṇa Sūtra* should not use those meanings. But if we don't use the five dwellings, we cannot break ignorance. If we don't use the two deaths, there is no permanence. Also, the "three Buddhas" come from the *Laṅkāvatāra*; [by that logic] other sūtras should have no three Buddha meaning. **All sūtras are spoken by the Buddha; names may differ, but meanings cannot be obstructed.**

#### The Five Types of Three Truths

Now we clarify the Three Truths in three parts: (1) Clarifying the Three Truths, (2) Judging coarse and subtle, (3) Opening the coarse to reveal the subtle. Setting aside the first two types of Two Truths (since they do not clarify the Middle), based on the [remaining] five types of Two Truths, we can discuss the Middle—hence there are **Five Types of Three Truths**.

**Type 1: Distinct-Entering-Shared Three Truths**

In terms of Distinct-entering-Shared, pointing to "neither with-outflows nor without-outflows," the Three Truths meaning is established:
*   **With-outflows** = Conventional
*   **Without-outflows** = Truth
*   **Neither with-outflows nor without-outflows** = Middle

Within this teaching, [the Middle] is only different from emptiness; the Middle has no function and **does not contain all dharmas**.

**Type 2: Perfect-Entering-Shared Three Truths**

In Perfect-entering-Shared, the Two Truths are not different from before; but pointing to "neither with-outflows nor without-outflows" as **containing all dharmas**—this differs from the former Middle.

**Type 3: Distinct Three Truths**

Distinct Three Truths: opening that conventional into two truths, contrasting truth as Middle. **The Middle is principle only.**

**Type 4: Perfect-Entering-Distinct Three Truths**

Perfect-entering-Distinct Three Truths: the Two Truths are not different from before; pointing to the true Middle as **fully containing Buddha-dharma**.

**Type 5: Perfect Three Truths**

**Perfect Three Truths:** Not only does the Middle fully contain Buddha-dharma, but truth and conventional also do. **The Three Truths are perfectly interfused—one is three, three is one**—as explained in the *Mohe Zhiguan*.

**Summary Table: Five Types of Three Truths**

| Type | Teaching | Conventional | Truth | Middle |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Distinct-into-Shared | With-outflows | Without-outflows | Neither (empty of function) |
| 2 | Perfect-into-Shared | Same | Same | Neither (contains all dharmas) |
| 3 | Distinct | Opened from conventional | Truth | Principle only |
| 4 | Perfect-into-Distinct | Same | Same | Contains Buddha-dharma |
| 5 | **Perfect** | Contains all | Contains all | Contains all |

#### Judging Coarse and Subtle

Judging coarse and subtle: Distinct-entering-Shared and Perfect-entering-Shared carry Shared expedients—hence coarse. Distinct not carrying Shared is subtle. Perfect-entering-Distinct carries Distinct expedients—hence coarse. **Perfect not carrying expedients is most subtle.**

In terms of the Five Flavors: Milk teaching has three types—two coarse, one subtle. Curds teaching is only coarse. Fresh Butter and Clarified Butter both have all five types—four coarse, one subtle. **This sūtra has only one type of Three Truths—this is the Relative Wonderful.**

Opening the coarse to reveal the subtle: deciding all former coarse [teachings] enter the one subtle—the Three Truths have nothing to contrast with—**this is Absolute Wonderful**.

### 6. The One Truth Realm

The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "What is called 'Two Truths' is actually one; [we] expediently speak of two. **It is like a drunk who has not yet vomited, seeing the sun and moon spinning, saying there is a 'spinning sun' and a 'non-spinning sun.'**" A sober person only sees non-spinning, not spinning. **The two that spin are coarse; the non-spinning is subtle.**

The Tripiṭaka entirely consists of spinning two—like that drunk person. The various Mahāyāna sūtras carry the spinning two while speaking of the non-spinning one. **This present sūtra straightforwardly abandons expedients, only teaching the unsurpassed Way—the non-spinning One Reality—hence it is subtle.**

#### Teaching vs. Realization

The *Daśabhūmika-sūtra-śāstra* clarifies: "Clarifying by stage-marks" means teaching approximate dharma. "Clarifying by stage-reality" means teaching true real dharma. Also: expedient teaching gates = teaching-path clarification; the dharma realized = realization-path clarification. We borrow this here.

"After a long time, the Buddhas must speak the Real"—this is the stage-reality meaning. "The Dharma attained at the Bodhi-site"—this is realization-path clarification. **Hence it is subtle.**

#### Beyond One Truth: No-Truth

Clinging to this Reality, "real words" become false words, because verbal views arise—hence called coarse. **Penetrating without attachment—hence called subtle.**

**The truths cannot be spoken**: "All dharmas from the beginning constantly have the mark of extinction"—how could there be various truths in confused mutual obstruction? If one truth does not exist, how could various truths exist? Each and every [truth] cannot be spoken. **What can be spoken is coarse; what cannot be spoken is subtle.**

"Cannot be spoken" also cannot be spoken—this is subtle. **"This subtle" is also subtle, because the path of words is cut off.**

#### The Fourfold Unspeakability

If we comprehensively make [all] unspeakable:
*   **Arising-arising** cannot be spoken
*   **Arising-non-arising** cannot be spoken
*   **Non-arising-arising** cannot be spoken
*   **Non-arising-non-arising** cannot be spoken

The former "unspeakable" is coarse; "non-arising-non-arising unspeakable" is subtle. If coarse differs from subtle, [they are] relative and not fused. **Coarse and subtle not being two—this is Absolute Wonderful.**

#### Why Do Both Small and Great Vehicles Have "No-Truth"?

**Q:** Why do both great and small vehicles discuss "no-truth"?

**A:** The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* says: "We do not break the nirvāṇa attained in the sage's mind. For those who have not attained [it] and cling to nirvāṇa, generating idle talk—like conditions producing the 'non-arising' fetter—therefore we break [it]." This is called "no-truth."

**Q:** If so, in the small vehicle both attained and not-attained are both broken. Should not great vehicle attained and not-attained also both be broken?

**A:** Not comparable. The small vehicle still has separate delusions to remove and separate principle to reveal—hence even what is attained must be broken. **The Middle is not thus—what is attained, how could it be broken?**

**Q:** If so, the Middle should only have One Real Truth—it should not be called "no-truth"!

**A:** For those who have not attained [it] and cling to the Middle, generating delusion—therefore we need "no-truth." **For those who have truly attained, there is [truth]; for those engaged in idle talk, there is not.**

## Footnotes

[^1]: The **Five Flavor Teachings** represent stages of the Buddha's teaching: Milk (*Avataṃsaka*), Curds (*Tripiṭaka*), Fresh Butter (*Vaipulya*), Clarified Butter (*Prajñā*), and Ghee (*Lotus/Nirvāṇa*).

[^2]: This is the famous statement of *tathāgatagarbha* (Buddha-nature) doctrine: the Buddha's knowledge and vision is already present within sentient beings.

[^3]: "All dharmas tend toward the eye; this tending does not surpass [the eye]" means that all dharmas are subsumed within each sense faculty—a statement of the mutual containment doctrine.

[^4]: "Mind, Buddha, and sentient beings—these three are without difference" is one of the most famous statements in Mahāyāna Buddhism, foundational to Tiantai and Chan.

[^5]: The **Ten Suchnesses** are a distinctive Tiantai reading of *Lotus Sūtra* Chapter 2. Kumārajīva's translation repeats "ru shi" ten times; Zhiyi interprets this as ten categories applicable to all dharmas.

[^6]: This triple interpretation of "Dharma-Realm" shows how each of the ten realms is (1) part of the totality, (2) distinct from others, and (3) complete in itself as principle.

[^7]: **Half-word** refers to the Hīnayāna teaching of impermanence and suffering; **full-word** refers to the Mahāyāna teaching of Buddha-nature and permanence. This terminology comes from the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*.

[^8]: The simile of the **foolish dog and clever lion** is famous in Tiantai and Chan: a foolish dog chases thrown objects endlessly; a clever lion attacks the thrower, ending the game. Similarly, one must address the source of conceptual proliferation, not chase concepts.

[^9]: The **three grasses** and **two trees** refer to the famous *Lotus Sūtra* parable (Chapter 5) of the rain falling equally on all plants, which grow according to their nature—symbolizing the various roots of beings receiving the one Dharma rain differently.

[^10]: This famous simile appears in the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* and becomes central to Tiantai's understanding of mind-only causality: "The mind is like a skilled painter, creating the five aggregates." Unlike Yogācāra's emphasis on *ālaya-vijñāna*, Tiantai emphasizes the **one-thought of ignorance** as the source.

[^11]: **Transformation-death** is the subtle death experienced by Arhats, Pratyekabuddhas, and great Bodhisattvas in the pure lands. Unlike the coarse birth-and-death of ordinary beings, this is the refined death of those who have transcended the three realms but not yet attained complete Buddhahood.

[^12]: **Three approaches to Two Truths teaching:**
*   **Following Feeling**: Teaching adapted to the listener's current disposition, which may vary greatly
*   **Feeling-and-Wisdom**: The listener perceives conventionally but understands truly
*   **Following Wisdom**: The sage perceives both conventional and ultimate with liberated wisdom

[^13]: The **Three Truths** doctrine becomes one of Tiantai's signature teachings. Unlike the Two Truths of Mādhyamaka (conventional and ultimate), Tiantai posits three: (1) **Emptiness**—the ultimate nature of all phenomena, (2) **Provisional Existence**—the conventional designations, and (3) **Middle**—the simultaneous affirmation of both without one-sidedness. In the Perfect Teaching, these three are "perfectly interfused"—each contains the others.
