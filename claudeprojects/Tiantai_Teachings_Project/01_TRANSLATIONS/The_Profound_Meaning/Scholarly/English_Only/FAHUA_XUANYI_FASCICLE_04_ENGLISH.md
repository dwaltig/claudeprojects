### Introduction: Why Position After Practice

Principle-truth being fused, wisdom complete without obstruction, guiding practice to subtle—these three meanings are already revealed, encompassing substance, essence, and function. **Why further clarify Position Subtlety? Because positions are the stages that practice ascends.**

#### The Variety of Position Teachings

**Positions have expedient and real versions, spread throughout the sūtras and śāstras.**

If the *Satyasiddhi-śāstra* and *Abhidharma* determine positions, their language does not reach the great vehicle. The *Daśabhūmika*, *Mahāyānasaṃgraha* and other śāstras determine positions separately in one line, their meanings not mutually encompassing.

The various *Vaipulya* sūtras clarify positions; the *Yingluo Jing* has already determined shallow and deep. The various *Prajñā* sūtras clarify positions; the *Renwang Jing* abundantly discusses high and low yet has not manifested coarse and subtle.

**This present sūtra does not manifest position names, yet its meaning encompasses small and great, roughly determining expedient and real...**

### The Six Positions in the Medicinal Herbs Parable

Now the *Medicinal Herbs Parable Chapter* clarifies only **six positions**.

The text says: "**Wheel-turning sage kings, Indra, Brahmā and various kings—these are small herbs.** Knowing the outflow-free dharmas, able to attain Nirvāṇa... dwelling alone in mountain forests... attaining Pratyekabuddha realization—**these are middle herbs.** Seeking the World-Honored One's place, 'I shall become Buddha,' practicing energetic concentration—**these are upper herbs.**"

**The former three meanings are positions within the Tripiṭaka.**

"Also the Buddha's children, single-mindedly [pursuing] the Buddha path, constantly practicing compassion, knowing themselves to become Buddha, definitely without doubt—**these are called small trees.**"

**Small trees are Shared Teaching positions.**

"**Abiding peacefully in supernatural powers, turning the non-regressing wheel, liberating immeasurable hundred-thousands of sentient beings...**—these are called **great trees**."

**Great trees are Distinct Teaching positions.**

#### Position 6: The Real Thing (Perfect Teaching)

Tracing back to the prose: "**One ground gives rise [to all], one rain moistens [all]**," and the later text: "**Now I shall speak the most real matter for you**"—this makes the sixth position.

**"The most real matter" is the Perfect Teaching position.**

#### Summary Table: Six Positions

| Position | Chapter Symbol | Teaching | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Small Herbs** | Tripiṭaka | Human/heavenly beings |
| 2 | **Middle Herbs** | Tripiṭaka | Two Vehicles (Śrāvaka, Pratyekabuddha) |
| 3 | **Upper Herbs** | Tripiṭaka | Tripiṭaka Bodhisattvas |
| 4 | **Small Trees** | Shared | Three vehicles via body-dharma |
| 5 | **Great Trees** | Distinct | Separate bodhisattva path |
| 6 | **The Real Thing** | Perfect | One Vehicle, most real |

CBETA’s order is explicit: **three Tripiṭaka positions**, then **Shared**, then **Distinct**, then **Perfect**—the six positions are arranged to show this progression.

### 1. Small Herbs: Human and Heavenly Positions

**Small herbs position is the human-heavenly vehicle.** Wheel-turning king is the human ruler position; Indra and Brahmā are celestial ruler positions. Both determine position according to retribution-fruit.

#### Human Realm Positions

Human position causes—namely upholding the five precepts, roughly divided into four grades:

| Grade | Precept Quality | Reward |
|---|---|---|
| Lower | Basic five precepts | Iron-wheel king (one continent) |
| Middle | Moderate practice | Bronze-wheel king (two continents) |
| Upper | Strong practice | Silver-wheel king (three continents) |
| Highest | Excellent practice | Gold-wheel king (four continents) |

All are scattered-mind precept keeping, combined with compassionate mind urging others to merit—hence their retribution is human rulership, a flying emperor, with the four directions returning to virtue, and divine treasures naturally responding.

#### Heavenly Realm Positions

**Heavenly vehicle positions**: cultivating the ten wholesome paths until naturally mature—this is the universal heavenly cause. Adding cultivation of meditation, one ascends to higher realms.

The three-realm heavenly fruits differ in height—the cultivated causes necessarily differ in depth.

### 2. Middle Herbs: Two Vehicles

**Middle herbs position is the Two Vehicles.**

#### Seven Worthy Ones

**Seven Worthy Ones:**
1.  Five Stilling-Hearts
2.  Separate-aspect Mindfulness
3.  General-aspect Mindfulness
4.  Warmth-dharma
5.  Summit-dharma
6.  Patience-dharma
7.  World-First Dharma

All are called "worthy" because **neighboring sagehood is called worthiness**. Able to use approximate understanding to subdue views, from the approximate to generate the true—hence called "neighboring sagehood."

#### Seven Sages

**Seven Sage positions:**
1.  Following-Faith Practice
2.  Following-Dharma Practice
3.  Faith-Understanding
4.  View-Attainment
5.  Body-Witness
6.  Time-Liberation Arhat
7.  Non-Time-Liberation Arhat

All are called "sages" because **"sage" means correct**. When suffering-patience clarity arises, one abandons ordinary nature and enters sage nature. **True wisdom sees principle—hence called "sage."**

### 3. Upper Herbs: Tripiṭaka Bodhisattvas

**Upper herbs position is the Tripiṭaka bodhisattva position.** This bodhisattva, from the initial arousing of *bodhi*-mind, generates compassionate vow-wishes, contemplates the Four Noble Truths, taking Path-truth as the initial gate, and practices the six *pāramitās*.

#### The Three Incalculable Eons

From the initial Śākyamuni to the time of Kāśyapa Buddha, this is named the **first incalculable eon**. [The bodhisattva] constantly separates from female bodies, and does not yet know whether he will become Buddha or not.

From Kāśyapa Buddha to Dīpaṃkara Buddha, this is named the **second incalculable eon**. At that time, though knowing oneself will become Buddha, one does not speak it aloud...

From Dīpaṃkara Buddha to Vipaśyin Buddha, this is named the **third incalculable eon**. At this time, the inner mind is clear; knowing oneself will become Buddha, one speaks aloud without fear or difficulty.

### 4. Small Trees: Shared Teaching Ten Grounds

**Small trees position is the Shared Teaching**, clarifying that the three-vehicle persons **together use the wordless path, cutting afflictions, entering ultimate truth**.

Body-dharma contemplative wisdom is not different; only the strength and weakness of wisdom-power differs, and whether affliction habits are exhausted or not exhausted makes the difference.

#### Shared Teaching Ten Grounds

| # | Ground | Content |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Dry Wisdom** | Body-dharma mindfulness, no samādhi-water yet |
| 2 | **Nature** | Warmth through World-First Dharma |
| 3 | **Eight-Person** | Eight patiences complete, one wisdom short |
| 4 | **Seeing** | Sees ultimate non-arising Four Truths |
| 5 | **Thin** | Desire-realm afflictions thinned |
| 6 | **Free-from-Desire** | Five lower fetters exhausted |
| 7 | **Done-What-Is-To-Be-Done** | All three-realm afflictions cut |
| 8 | **Pratyekabuddha** | Encroaches on habitual tendencies |
| 9 | **Bodhisattva** | Exits emptiness into provisional, dual observation |
| 10 | **Buddha** | One thought completes all |

### 5. Great Trees: Distinct Teaching Positions

**Great trees position is the Distinct Teaching position.** This Distinct Teaching—names, meanings, principle, delusion, wisdom, cutting—**all are distinct**.

This is precisely about **dependent-origination provisional names, Ganges-sands Buddha-dharmas, Tathāgatagarbha principle, eternal-abiding Nirvāṇa, and immeasurable Four Truths**—discussing the position sequence.

#### Distinct Teaching Fifty-Two Positions

Now determining position name-numbers, following the *Yingluo* and *Renwang*... The *Yingluo* [teaches] **fifty-two positions**, with complete name-meanings...

| Stage | Positions | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **Ten Faiths** | 1-10 | Outer ordinary, dry wisdom, subduing patience |
| **Ten Abidings** | 11-20 | Inner ordinary, habit-seed nature |
| **Ten Practices** | 21-30 | Nature-seed nature |
| **Ten Dedications** | 31-40 | Way-seed nature |
| **Ten Grounds** | 41-50 | Sage-seed nature |
| **Equal Awakening** | 51 | Diamond-mind, nearly Buddha |
| **Wondrous Awakening** | 52 | Ultimate Buddhahood |

### Coarse and Subtle Judgment

**If we open the coarse to reveal the subtle, there is no coarse to contrast—this is the Absolute Practice Subtlety meaning.**

## Footnotes

[^1]: The **Six Positions** from the Medicinal Herbs chapter provide Master Zhiyi's framework for understanding all the different path structures across Buddhism. Just as different plants grow to different heights from the same rain, practitioners of different readinesses attain different levels from the same Dharma rain.
