# The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra

## Fascicle 7: Fundamental and Trace

**Scholarly Translation by The Architect**

### Introduction: The Two Halves

The Ten Trace Subtleties represented the **first half** of the wish-fulfilling jewel—the Buddha's manifest teaching.

Now we turn to the Ten Fundamental Subtleties—**the second half**—addressing the Buddha's eternal nature revealed in Chapter 16, "Lifespan of the Tathāgata."

### Part One: Six Meanings of Fundamental and Trace

Explaining Fundamental and Trace has **six meanings**:

1.  **Principle as Fundamental**: **Fundamental means Principle-Fundamental**—this is Reality-Mark, the One Ultimate Path. **Trace means**: except for Reality-Mark of all dharmas, everything else is called trace.
2.  **Principle-and-Event as Fundamental**: Moreover, **both principle and event are called Fundamental**; **explaining principle and explaining event are called Teaching-Trace**.
3.  **Teaching as Fundamental**: Moreover, **teaching of principle-and-event is Fundamental**; **receiving teaching and practicing is Trace**—like a person depending on a place leaves footprints; following tracks, one finds the place.
4.  **Body as Fundamental**: Moreover, **practice can realize the Body; Body is Fundamental**. **Depending on Body to activate Function; Function is Trace.**
5.  **Real-Attainment as Fundamental**: Moreover, **actually attaining Body-and-Function is Fundamental**; **provisionally bestowing Body-and-Function is Trace**.
6.  **Today-and-Already as Fundamental**: Moreover, **what is revealed today is Fundamental**; **what was already spoken before is Trace**.

According to these six meanings, we clarify Fundamental and Trace.

#### Summary Table: Six Meanings

| # | Fundamental | Trace |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Reality-Mark principle | Everything else |
| 2 | Principle and event | Teaching about them |
| 3 | Teaching | Practice based on teaching |
| 4 | Body/Substance | Function/Use |
| 5 | Real attainment | Provisional bestowal |
| 6 | What's revealed now | What was said before |

### Part Two: The Ten Fundamental Subtleties

| # | Fundamental Subtlety |
|---|---|
| 1 | Fundamental Cause |
| 2 | Fundamental Fruit |
| 3 | Fundamental Land |
| 4 | Fundamental Resonance |
| 5 | Fundamental Supernatural Powers |
| 6 | Fundamental Dharma-Exposition |
| 7 | Fundamental Retinue |
| 8 | Fundamental Nirvāṇa |
| 9 | Fundamental Lifespan |
| 10 | Fundamental Benefits |

This follows the CBETA order: **cause → fruit → land → resonance → powers → exposition → retinue → Nirvāṇa → lifespan → benefits**.

#### 1. Fundamental Cause Subtlety

**Fundamental Cause Subtlety**: The original initial arising of bodhicitta, the cause cultivated through practicing the bodhisattva path.

If the sixteen princes at Great-Penetration Buddha's time propagated the sūtra and established connections—**all this is intermediate activity, not Fundamental Cause**.

The text says: "**With Buddha-eye I observe that distant past as if it were today.**" Only Buddha can know such remoteness—all these are **Trace Causes, not Fundamental Cause**.

If we retained the intermediate causes, later practitioners would find it hard to believe. Hence the *Lotus* **brushes away traces to remove doubt**... Before all that, what was practiced—this is called Fundamental, which is **Fundamental Cause Subtlety**.

#### 2. Fundamental Fruit Subtlety

The originally first practiced perfect-subtle cause, **attaining ultimate Permanence, Bliss, Self, and Purity**—this is **Fundamental Fruit**.

We **do not take the bodhi-tree site where Vairocana became Buddha as Fundamental Fruit**.

We only take **"since becoming Buddha, immeasurably long ago"—the originally attained fruit**—as **Fundamental Fruit Subtlety**.

#### 3. Fundamental Land Subtlety

Having achieved Fundamental Fruit, there must be a land to dwell in... The text says: "**Since then, I have always been in this Sahā world expounding Dharma and teaching.**"

According to this text, it's really **not today's Trace-Sahā, nor the intermediate expedient-trace location**—it is **Fundamental Sahā**, which is **Fundamental Land Subtlety**.

#### 4. Fundamental Resonance Subtlety

Having achieved Fruit, there are **the twenty-five samādhis realized at that original time**, compassion and vows, readiness and response mutually connected, **able to be quiescent yet illuminating**—hence Fundamental Resonance.

#### 5-10. Remaining Fundamental Subtleties

| Subtlety | Content |
|---|---|
| **Supernatural Powers** | Original powers with neutral transformation-upon-transformation dhyāna |
| **Dharma-Exposition** | Original turning of the Dharma-wheel |
| **Retinue** | Original disciples—"those from below are my children" |
| **Nirvāṇa** | Original extinction/non-extinction |
| **Lifespan** | Original limitless lifespan |
| **Benefits** | Original benefiting with karma-, vow-, power-, response-born |

### Near Benefits and the Tenfold Sequence

Zhiyi immediately follows the ten subtleties with a discussion of the **near benefits** that arise when the Dharma is proclaimed from the Nirvāṇa-stage “silent room”. He repeats the imagery of poisonous drums and heavenly drums, the “light of the Buddha” that reaches every realm, and he classifies those who receive the teaching into the range of **“small/mid/large” benefits** depending on their capacity. This leads directly to the **“sevenfold/tenfold” cascade** of benefits that the Lotus Sutra keeps returning to: 

1.  The sweet “coolness” that relieves each of the eight major hells, hungry ghosts, and so on.
2.  The karmic-turning benefits that break the twenty-five harmful habits and convert them into wholesome roots (the “cause” benefits such as the removal of greed, anger, and ignorance).
3.  The śrāvaka/stream-enterer benefits (small grass and middle grass) whose efforts receive the four samādhis that vanquish lower defilements.
4.  The pratyekabuddha benefits, wherein deep insight dissolves bubbles of craving and fear.
5.  The bodhisattva benefits (flying through four samādhis) that melt the six hindrances and ripen the six pāramitās.
6.  The “common” vehicle benefits, which purify all three seeds and reveal universal wisdom.
7.  The “separate/gradual” path benefits that combine ten faiths/ten practices and eventual awakening (the big tree benefits).
8.  The “sudden/complete” path benefits where the three truths (conventional, ultimate, Middle) are simultaneously activated, evenly ripening the ten suchnesses.
9.  The “transformative” benefits of the provisional lands where disciples receive expedient states before entering the real path.
10. The consummate benefits of the real land, where non-birth/non-death wisdom radiates without remainder and the lifespans of Buddha and disciples become boundless.

Zhiyi uses the **five flavors metaphor (milk/curd/buttermilk/yogurt/ghee)** to map earlier teachings onto these benefit categories: earlier sutras tasted like milk (coarse) while the Lotus Sutra produces only the “wonderful” taste. The core point: every stage the Buddha taught corresponds to one of the ten benefits, but the Lotus Sutra presents them as a single, unquestionable whole where coarse and subtle merge.

### Benefit Questions and the Three Truths

Several rhetorical questions close the discussion, reinforcing that the ten benefits are necessary because each successive stage continues to cut through a deeper form of ignorance (from karma to fruition to the Middle). They reaffirm that the **three truths (conventional, ultimate, Middle)** are already implied in every realm—through the five aggregates and their emptiness—so the Lotus Sutra’s resonance is not limited to faraway ideals but is present in **every moment of practice**. In Zhiyi’s logic, the more “far-reaching” benefits (the later numbers in the list) are not a separate add-on but simply the same readiness/response matrix transposed to increasingly subtle realms, culminating in the boundless “real land” benefits of the ten-fold sequence.

### Fundamental and Trace Though Different, Are Inconceivably One

This refrain appears throughout Fascicle 7:

> "**Fundamental and Trace, though different, are inconceivably one.**"

The point is not to reject the Trace but to understand that:
1.  The Trace arises from the Fundamental
2.  By following the Trace, we reach the Fundamental
3.  Ultimately they are non-dual

## Footnotes

[^1]: The **Ten Fundamental Subtleties** parallel the Ten Trace Subtleties but address the Buddha's eternal reality rather than his manifest teaching. The key structural shift: Trace Subtleties 1-5 (Cause, True-Nature, Practice, Position) deal with cause; here **Cause** is condensed into one subtlety, while **Nirvāṇa** and **Lifespan** are added as separate subtleties.
