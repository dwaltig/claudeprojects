## ○四、廣釋境
# The Extensive Interpretation of Realm

---

廣釋境，又為二：一、釋諸境，二、論諸境同異。

> The extensive interpretation of Realm has two parts: (1) Interpreting the [six] realms, (2) Discussing the sameness and difference of the realms.

釋境為六：一、十如境。二、因緣境。三、四諦境。四、二諦境。五、三諦境。六、一諦境。

> **Interpreting the Realm has six [categories]:**
> 1. **Ten Suchnesses Realm** (十如境)
> 2. **Dependent Origination Realm** (因緣境)
> 3. **Four Noble Truths Realm** (四諦境)
> 4. **Two Truths Realm** (二諦境)
> 5. **Three Truths Realm** (三諦境)
> 6. **One Truth Realm** (一諦境)

---

### On the Sequence

然眾經赴緣，明境甚眾，豈可具載？略舉六種。

> The various sūtras respond to conditions, clarifying realms in great number—how could we exhaustively record them? We briefly raise six kinds.

六種次第者，十如是，此經所說，故在初。次十二因緣，三世輪迴，本來具有。如來出世，分別巧示，四諦名興。從廣至略，次辨二諦。二諦語通，別顯中道，次明三諦。三諦猶帶方便，直顯真實，次明一諦。一諦猶有名相，次明無諦。始從無明，終至實際，略用六種足。

> **The sequence of the six:** The Ten Suchnesses are spoken in this sūtra, hence placed first. Next, the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination—cyclic existence through three times, originally complete. The Tathāgata appeared in the world, skillfully distinguishing and revealing [them], and the name "Four Noble Truths" arose. Moving from extensive to concise, we next analyze the Two Truths. The language of Two Truths is comprehensive; to separately reveal the Middle Way, we next clarify the Three Truths. The Three Truths still carry expedients; to directly reveal the Real, we next clarify the One Truth. The One Truth still has name and marks; [beyond this] we clarify No-Truth. Beginning from ignorance, ending at the Real Limit—brief use of six kinds suffices.

---

## 一、明十如境
# 1. The Ten Suchnesses Realm

已如前說(云云)。

> Already explained above.

---

## 二、釋因緣境
# 2. The Dependent Origination Realm

---

又為四：一、正釋。二、判麁妙。三、開麁顯妙。四、觀心。

> This has four parts: (1) Direct interpretation, (2) Judging coarse and subtle, (3) Opening the coarse to reveal the subtle, (4) Mind contemplation.

---

### 正釋 — Direct Interpretation

正釋，又為四：

> The direct interpretation has four [types]:

一、明思議生滅十二因緣。二、明思議不生不滅十二因緣。三、明不思議生滅十二因緣。四、明不思議不生不滅十二因緣。

> 1. **Conceivable Arising-and-Ceasing** Twelve Links
> 2. **Conceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing** Twelve Links
> 3. **Inconceivable Arising-and-Ceasing** Twelve Links
> 4. **Inconceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing** Twelve Links

---

#### Type 1: Conceivable Arising-and-Ceasing (思議生滅)

思議兩種因緣，為利、鈍兩緣，辨界內法論也。《中》(論云)：「為鈍根弟子說十二因緣生滅相。」

> The two conceivable types of dependent origination are for sharp and dull capacities, discussing dharmas within the [three] realms. The *Madhyamaka-śāstra* says: "For dull-rooted disciples, [we] teach the arising-and-ceasing marks of the twelve links."

此簡異外道；外道邪謂諸法從自在天生，或言世性，或言微塵，或言父母，或言無因，種種邪推，不當道理。

> This distinguishes [Buddhism] from non-Buddhists. Non-Buddhists wrongly claim that dharmas arise from Īśvara, or from world-nature, or from atoms, or from parents, or from no cause—various wrong inferences that do not accord with reason.

---

##### The Painter Simile

此正因緣不同邪計，唯是過去無明顛倒心中造作諸行，能出今世六道苦果，好惡不同。

> This correct dependent origination differs from wrong views. It is only that past ignorance, in the confused mind, creates various actions, producing the present-life suffering-fruit of the six destinies, good and bad differing.

《正法念》云：「畫人分布五彩，圖一切形，端正醜陋，不可稱計。」原其根本，從畫手出，六道差別，非自在等作，悉從一念無明心出。

> The *Saddharmasmṛtyupasthāna* says: "A painter distributes five colors, drawing all forms—beautiful and ugly beyond measure." Tracing to the root, they come from the painter's hand. **The differentiation of the six destinies is not made by Īśvara and such; all comes from the one-thought of the ignorant mind.**

無明與上品惡行業合，即起地獄因緣，如畫出黑色。無明與中品惡行業合，起畜生道因緣，如畫出赤色。無明與下品惡行合，起鬼道因緣，如畫青色。無明與下品善行合，即起修羅因緣，如畫黃色。無明與中品善行合，即起人因緣，如畫白色。無明與上品善行合，即起天因緣，如畫上上白色。

> Ignorance combined with upper-grade evil actions gives rise to hell causes, like painting black. Ignorance combined with middle-grade evil actions gives rise to animal causes, like painting red. Ignorance combined with lower-grade evil actions gives rise to hungry-ghost causes, like painting blue-green. Ignorance combined with lower-grade good actions gives rise to asura causes, like painting yellow. Ignorance combined with middle-grade good actions gives rise to human causes, like painting white. Ignorance combined with upper-grade good actions gives rise to heavenly causes, like painting the highest white.

當知無明與諸行合故，即有六道，名色、六入、觸、受、愛、取、有、生、老、病、死等，隨上中下，差別不同。

> Know that because ignorance combines with actions, there are the six destinies—name-and-form, six sense-bases, contact, feeling, craving, grasping, becoming, birth, old age, sickness, death, etc.—following upper, middle, and lower, differing in distinction.

---

##### The Wheel of Existence

人天諸趣，苦樂萬品，以生歸死，死已還生，三世盤迴，車輪旋火。

> Human and heavenly destinies, myriad kinds of suffering and happiness, from birth returning to death, after death being reborn again—**cycling through three times like a spinning wheel of fire**.

故《經》言：「有河洄澓沒眾生，無明所盲不能出。」經又稱為十二牽連更相拘帶，亦名十二重城，亦名十二棘園。

> Therefore the sūtra says: "There is a river with whirlpools drowning sentient beings; blinded by ignorance, they cannot escape." The sūtra also calls it "twelve mutually pulling and binding" (十二牽連), also "twelve-layered city" (十二重城), also "twelve-thorn garden" (十二棘園).

此十二因緣，新新生滅，念念不住，故名生滅十二因緣也。

> These twelve links, ever-newly arising and ceasing, not abiding for a single thought-moment—hence called the **Arising-and-Ceasing Twelve Links**.

---

料簡者，《纓珞》第四云：「無明緣行，生十二，乃至生緣老死，亦生十二，是則一百二十因緣。初是癡，乃至老死亦是癡。不覺故癡，初亦不覺，至老死亦不覺；癡故生，癡故死。若能覺因緣，因緣即不行，癡不行故，則將來生死盡，名為黠，黠即隨道。」又十二緣起、十二緣生，為同為異？此同是一切有為法，故無異。亦有差別，因是緣起，果是緣生，則二緣起，五緣生，三緣起，二緣生。又無明是緣起，行是緣生，乃至生是緣起，老死是緣生。又四句：緣起非緣生，未來二支法是也。緣生非緣起，過去二支，現在阿羅漢最後死陰是也。緣起緣生者，除過去、現在羅漢死五陰，諸餘過去、現在法是也。非緣起非緣生者，無為法是也。《法身經》說：「諸無明決定生行，不相離、常相隨逐，是名緣起，非緣生。若無明不決定生行，或時相離不相隨，是名緣生，非緣起。乃至老死亦如是。」尊者和須蜜說：「因是緣起、從因生法是緣生；和合是緣起，從和合生是緣生。」十二因緣支，二是過去則止常，二是未來則止斷，現在則顯中道。推現三因，則說未來二果；推現在五果，則說過去二因。三世皆有十二支，為推因果，故作如是說。

> Analytical distinctions: The *Yingluo* (fascicle 4) says: "Ignorance conditions action, giving rise to twelve; up to birth conditioning old age and death, also giving rise to twelve—this is then one hundred and twenty dependent originations. At the beginning it is delusion; up to old age and death it is also delusion. Not awakened, therefore delusion; at the beginning also not awakened; up to old age and death also not awakened. Because of delusion there is birth; because of delusion there is death. If one can awaken to dependent origination, dependent origination then does not function; because delusion does not function, future birth-and-death are exhausted, called 'clever.' The clever then follow the Way." Again, the twelve links as arising (緣起) and the twelve links as birth (緣生): are they the same or different? They are the same as all conditioned dharmas, therefore not different. There are also distinctions: cause is arising, result is birth; thus two are arising, five are birth; three are arising, two are birth. Again, ignorance is arising, action is birth; up to birth is arising, old age and death are birth. Again, four statements: arising but not birth is the two future branches. Birth but not arising is the two past branches and the present Arhat's final death-aggregate. Both arising and birth are all other past and present dharmas except the past and present Arhat's death five aggregates. Neither arising nor birth are unconditioned dharmas. The *Dharma-body Sutra* says: "If ignorance definitely gives rise to action, not separating and constantly following, this is called arising, not birth. If ignorance does not definitely give rise to action, sometimes separating and not following, this is called birth, not arising. Up to old age and death it is also thus." Venerable Vasumitra said: "Cause is arising; dharmas born from cause are birth. Combination is arising; what is born from combination is birth." Among the twelve dependent-origination branches, two are past and thus stop permanence; two are future and thus stop annihilation; the present reveals the Middle Way. Pushing the present three causes, one speaks of two future fruits; pushing the present five fruits, one speaks of two past causes. All three times have twelve branches; to infer cause and fruit, one speaks thus.

十二時者，「無明」是過去諸結時。「行」是過去諸行時。「識」者，相續心及眷屬時。「名、色」者，已受生相續，未生四種色根，六入未具。一、歌邏羅，二、阿浮陀，三、卑尸，四、伽那，五、波羅奢訶。如是等時，名「名色」。「六入」，已生四種色根，具足六入。此諸根未能為觸作所依，是時名「六入」。此諸根已能為觸作所依，未別苦、樂，不能避危害，捉火觸毒，把刃不淨，是時名「觸」。能分別苦、樂，避危害等，能生貪愛，不起婬欲，於一切物不生染著，是時名「受」。具上三受，是時名「愛」。以貪境故，四方追求，是時名「取」。追求之時，起身、口、意，是時名「有」。如現在識在於未來，是時名「生」。如現在名色、六入、觸、受，於未來，是時名「老死」。

> The twelve times: "ignorance" is the time of past fetters. "Action" is the time of past actions. "Consciousness" is the time of the continuing mind and its retinue. "Name-and-form" is having received the continuity of birth, not yet producing the four kinds of sense faculties; the six bases are not complete. (1) Kalala, (2) Arbuda, (3) Peśī, (4) Ghana, (5) Praśākhā—times such as these are called "name-and-form." "Six bases": the four kinds of sense faculties have been produced, and the six bases are complete. These faculties are not yet able to serve as the basis for contact; this time is called "six bases." These faculties are able to serve as the basis for contact, but have not yet distinguished suffering and joy; unable to avoid harm, grasping fire and touching poison, taking blades and impurity; this time is called "contact." Able to distinguish suffering and joy and avoid harm, able to give rise to craving, not producing lustful desire, not producing attachment to any object—this time is called "feeling." With the three feelings above complete, this time is called "craving." Because of craving for objects, one pursues in the four directions; this time is called "grasping." At the time of pursuing, bodily, verbal, and mental actions arise; this time is called "becoming." As present consciousness is in the future, this time is called "birth." As present name-and-form, six bases, contact, and feeling are in the future, this time is called "old age and death."

一剎那十二緣者，若以貪心殺生，彼相應愚是「無明」。相應思是「行」。相應心是「識」。起有作業，必有「名色」。起有作業，必有「六入」。彼相應觸是「觸」。彼相應受是「受」。貪即是「愛」。彼相應纏是「取」。彼身口作業是「有」。如此諸法生是「生」。此諸法變是「老」。此諸法壞是「死」。

> The twelve links in a single instant: if with a craving mind one kills, the corresponding delusion is "ignorance." The corresponding volition is "action." The corresponding mind is "consciousness." When action arises, there must be "name-and-form." When action arises, there must be "six bases." The corresponding contact is "contact." The corresponding feeling is "feeling." Craving is "craving." The corresponding entanglement is "grasping." That bodily and verbal action is "becoming." The arising of these dharmas is "birth." Their change is "old." Their destruction is "death."

問：

> **Question:**

何不說病為支？

> Why is illness not spoken of as a branch?

答：

> **Answer:**

一切時、一切處盡有者，立支。自有人從生無病，如薄拘羅，生來不識頭痛，況餘病！是故不立。

> Only what exists at all times and in all places is established as a branch. There are people who from birth have no illness—like Bākula, who from birth did not know a headache, much less other illnesses. Therefore it is not established.

問：

> **Question:**

憂悲是支不？

> Are sorrow and grief branches?

答：

> **Answer:**

非也，以終顯始耳，如老死必憂悲。

> No; it is only to reveal the beginning through the end, just as old age and death necessarily involve sorrow and grief.

問：

> **Question:**

無明有因不？老死有果不？若有，應是支。若無，則墮無因無果法。

> Does ignorance have a cause? Does old age and death have a fruit? If they do, they should be branches; if not, one falls into the dharma of no cause and no fruit.

答：

> **Answer:**

有而非支。無明有因，謂不正思惟；老死有果，謂憂悲。又無明有因，謂老死；老死有果，謂無明。現在愛、取，是過去無明；現在名色、六入、觸、受，此四若在未來，名老死。如說受緣愛，當知說老死緣無明也。猶如車輪，更互相因也。

> They exist but are not branches. Ignorance has a cause: improper thought; old age and death have a fruit: sorrow and grief. Again, ignorance has a cause: old age and death; old age and death have a fruit: ignorance. Present craving and grasping are past ignorance; present name-and-form, six bases, contact, and feeling—if these four are in the future, they are called old age and death. Just as one says "feeling conditions craving," you should know that one says "old age and death condition ignorance." It is like a wheel: mutually conditioning each other.

欲界胎生者，具十二支。色界者十一，無名色也。無色界有十，除名色、六入。又言具有。色界初生，諸根未猛利時，是名「名色」。無色界雖無色而有名，當知悉具十二支也。

> Those born by womb in the Desire Realm have all twelve branches. The Form Realm has eleven, lacking name-and-form. The Formless Realm has ten, excluding name-and-form and six bases. Yet it is also said to have [them]. At the first birth in the Form Realm, when the faculties are not yet sharp, this is called "name-and-form." The Formless Realm, though without form, has name; know that it fully has the twelve branches.

問：

> **Question:**

無明、行與取、有何異？

> How do ignorance, action, and grasping/becoming differ?

答：

> **Answer:**

過、現、新故，已與果、未與果等異。

> They differ as past, present, and new; as already connected with fruit, not yet connected with fruit, and so on.

#### Type 2: Conceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing (思議不生不滅)

二、思議不生不滅十二者，此以巧破拙。《中論》云：「為利根弟子說十二不生不滅。」

> Second, Conceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing Twelve Links: this uses the skillful to break the clumsy. The *Madhyamaka-śāstra* says: "For sharp-rooted disciples, [we] teach the twelve as non-arising-non-ceasing."

癡如虛空，乃至老死如虛空：無明如幻化，不可得故，乃至老死如幻化，不可得。

> **Delusion is like empty space**, up to old-age-and-death being like empty space. Ignorance is like illusion—unobtainable; up to old-age-and-death being like illusion—unobtainable.

《金光明》云：「無明體相，本自不有，妄想因緣，和合而有。」

> The *Suvarṇaprabhāsa* says: "The nature and marks of ignorance originally do not exist; due to false thinking and conditions, they combine to appear."

不善思惟心行所造，如幻師在四衢道，幻作種種象、馬、纓珞、人物等，癡謂真實、智知非真。無明幻出六道依正，當知本自不有，無明所為。如知藤本非蛇，則怖心不生，不生故不滅。是名思議不生不滅十二因緣相也。

> Created by unwholesome mental fabrication, like a magician at a crossroads conjuring various elephants, horses, ornaments, and people—the foolish consider them real; the wise know they are not real. **Ignorance conjures the six destinies' dependent and proper [retributions]**—know that they originally do not exist; ignorance creates them. It is like knowing that a vine is not a snake—then the fearful mind does not arise; not arising, it does not cease. **This is the Conceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing Twelve Links.**

---

#### Type 3: Inconceivable Arising-and-Ceasing (不思議生滅)

三、不思議生滅因緣者，破小明大，為利鈍兩緣說界外法也。

> Third, Inconceivable Arising-and-Ceasing: breaking the small to clarify the great, teaching dharmas beyond the [three] realms for both sharp and dull capacities.

《華嚴》云：「心如工畫師，作種種五陰。一切世間中，莫不從心造。」畫師，即無明心也。一切世間，即是十法界假實國土等也。

> The *Avataṃsaka* says: "**The mind is like a skilled painter, creating various five aggregates. In all the world, nothing is not made by mind.**" The painter is the ignorant mind. All worlds means the ten Dharma-Realms' provisional and real lands, etc.

---

諸論明心出一切法不同，或言：阿黎耶是真識，出一切法。或言：阿黎耶是無沒識，無記無明出一切法。若定執性實，墮冥初生覺、從覺生我心過。尚不成界內思議因緣，豈得成界外不思議因緣？惑既非不思議境，翻惑之解，豈得成不思議智？破此，如《止觀》中說。今明無明之心，不自、不他、不共、不無因，四句皆不可思議。若有四悉檀因緣，亦可得說：如四句求夢不可得，而說夢中見一切事；四句求無明不可得，而從無明出界內外一切法。

> The treatises explain the mind as producing all dharmas in different ways. Some say: ālaya is true consciousness, producing all dharmas. Some say: ālaya is the non‑perishing consciousness; indeterminate ignorance produces all dharmas. If one fixes and grasps a real nature, one falls into the error of darkness giving rise to initial awakening and, from awakening, giving rise to the "I"-mind. It still does not accomplish conceivable dependent origination within the realm; how could it accomplish inconceivable dependent origination beyond the realm? If delusion itself is not an inconceivable realm, how could the understanding that turns delusion become inconceivable wisdom? Break this as explained in the *Zhiguan*. Now we clarify: the mind of ignorance is not self‑caused, not other‑caused, not both, not without cause; the four statements are all inconceivable. If there are four siddhānta causal conditions, they can also be explained: as in the four statements, seeking a dream cannot be obtained, yet one speaks of seeing all things in a dream; in the four statements, seeking ignorance cannot be obtained, yet from ignorance issue all dharmas within and beyond the realm.

出界內十二因緣，如前說。

> The within‑realm twelve links have been explained above.

##### Beyond-Realm Dependent Origination

出界外十二因緣者，如《寶性論》云：「羅漢、支佛空智，於如來身本所不見。」

> The **beyond-realm twelve links**: as the *Ratnagotravibhāga* says: "The emptiness-wisdom of Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas fundamentally does not see the Tathāgata's body."

二乘雖有無常等四對治，依如來法身，復是顛倒，顛倒故即是無明。

> Although the Two Vehicles have the four antidotes of impermanence, etc., in dependence on the Tathāgata's Dharma-body, [their view] is again confused—**because of confusion, it is ignorance**.

住無漏界中有四種障，謂緣、相、生、壞。

> **Within the outflow-free realm, there are four kinds of obstruction**: condition (緣), mark (相), birth (生), decay (壞).

緣者，謂無明住地，與行作緣也。相者，無明共行為因也。生者，謂無明住地，共無漏業因，生三種意生身也。壞者，三種意生身，緣不可思議變易死也。

> - **Condition**: The ground-of-ignorance conditions action.
> - **Mark**: Ignorance together with action becomes cause.
> - **Birth**: The ground-of-ignorance, together with outflow-free karmic cause, gives birth to the **three kinds of mind-made bodies**.
> - **Decay**: The three mind-made bodies condition **inconceivable transformation-death** (變易死).

還如界內十二因緣，從無明至老死也。

> This is still like the within-realm twelve links, from ignorance to old-age-and-death.

緣者，即無明支也。相者，行支也。生者，即名色等五支也。愛、取、有三支，例前可知也。壞即生死支也。此十二支，數同界內，義意大異。

> "Condition" is the ignorance branch. "Mark" is the action branch. "Birth" is the five branches beginning with name-and-form. The three branches of craving, grasping, and becoming are analogous to the above and can be known. "Decay" is the birth-and-death branch. These twelve branches are numerically the same as within the realm, but their meaning is greatly different.

##### The Four Imperfections

彼論云：「三種意生身，未得離無明垢，未得究竟無為淨；無明、細戲論未永滅，未得究竟無為我；無明、細戲論集，因無漏業生意陰未永滅，未得無為樂；煩惱染、業染、生染未究竟滅，未證甘露究竟常。」

> That treatise says: "The three mind-made bodies have not yet separated from the defilement of ignorance—not yet attaining ultimate unconditioned **purity**. The subtle conceptual proliferations of ignorance are not yet permanently extinguished—not yet attaining ultimate unconditioned **self**. The accumulation of subtle conceptual proliferations, mental aggregates born from outflow-free karma, are not yet permanently extinguished—not yet attaining unconditioned **bliss**. The defilements of affliction, karma, and birth are not yet ultimately extinguished—not yet realizing the ultimate **permanence** of sweet-dew."

以「緣」煩惱道故，不得大淨；以「相」業道故，不得八自在我；以「生」苦道故，不得大樂；以「壞」老死故，不得不變易常者，由不思議生滅十二因緣也。是為界外不思議生滅十二因緣相(云云)。

> Because "condition" is the affliction-path, one does not obtain great purity; because "mark" is the karma-path, one does not obtain the eightfold self‑mastery; because "birth" is the suffering-path, one does not obtain great bliss; because "decay" is old age and death, one does not obtain unchanging permanence. This is due to the inconceivable arising‑and‑ceasing twelve links. This is the beyond‑realm inconceivable arising‑and‑ceasing twelve links (and so on).

---

#### Type 4: Inconceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing (不思議不生不滅)

不思議不生不滅十二因緣者，為利根人即事顯理也。

> Fourth, **Inconceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing** Twelve Links: for sharp-rooted people, it manifests principle precisely in phenomena.

《大經》云：「十二因緣名為佛性」者，無明、愛、取既是煩惱，煩惱道即是菩提。菩提通達無復煩惱，煩惱既無，即究竟淨，了因佛性也。

> The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "**The twelve links of dependent origination are called Buddha-nature.**" Ignorance, craving, and grasping are afflictions; the path of affliction is precisely *bodhi*. *Bodhi* penetrates [them] so there is no more affliction; affliction not existing, there is ultimate purity—**the understanding-cause Buddha-nature**.

行、有是業道，即是解脫，解脫自在，緣因佛性也。

> Action and becoming are the path of karma—precisely liberation. Liberation is self-mastery—**the conditioning-cause Buddha-nature**.

名色、老死是苦道，苦即法身。法身無苦、無樂，是名大樂。不生不死是常，正因佛性。

> Name-and-form, old-age-and-death are the path of suffering—suffering is precisely the Dharma-body. The Dharma-body having neither suffering nor [ordinary] happiness is called **Great Bliss**. Neither arising nor ceasing is **permanence**—**the direct-cause Buddha-nature**.

故言無明與愛，是二中間，即是中道。無明是過去，愛是現在，若邊若中無非佛性、並是常樂我淨，無明不生亦復不滅。是名不思議不生不滅十二因緣也。

> Therefore it says: "Between ignorance and craving—this is the Middle Way." Ignorance is past; craving is present. **Whether edge or middle, nothing is not Buddha-nature; all is permanence, bliss, self, and purity.** Ignorance neither arises nor ceases. **This is the Inconceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing Twelve Links.**

---

二判麁妙者，因緣之境不當麁妙，取之淺深，致有差降耳。若從無明生諸行乃至老死，從三生二，從二生七，從七生三，更互因緣，煩惱業因緣、業苦因緣，無常生滅。《中論》判此教鈍根法。《涅槃》稱慇懃半字。此經：「但離虛妄，名為解脫。」故知此境則麁。若無明體相本自不有，妄想因緣和合而有，境既如幻，智亦叵得。經言：「若有一法過於涅槃，我亦說如幻、如化。」《中論》明教利根。《涅槃》稱長者教。《毘伽羅論》、《大品》名為「如實巧度」，此經名小樹。斯境則巧。若無明是緣，從緣生相，從相有生，從生故壞。滅緣故淨，除相故我，盡生則樂，無壞故常。《中論》云：「因緣生法，亦名為假名。」《大品》稱「十二緣，獨菩薩法。」《涅槃》稱因滅無明，則得熾燃。此經則是大樹，而得增長。比前為妙，方後為麁。若言：無明三道即是三德，不須斷三德更求三德。《中論》云：「因緣所生法，亦名中道義。」《大品》說十二因緣，是為坐道場。《涅槃》云：「無明與愛，是二中間，即是中道。」此經：「佛種從緣起，是故說一乘。」亦名最實事。豈非妙耶！前三是權，故為麁；後一是實，故為妙。用此麁妙歷五味教者，乳教具二種因緣，一麁一妙。酪教一麁。生蘇三麁一妙。熟蘇二麁一妙。《法華》但說一妙。是名待麁因緣，明妙因緣也。

> Second, judging coarse and subtle: the realm of dependent origination is not itself coarse or subtle; it is because we take it shallow or deep that there are gradations. If, from ignorance, one gives rise to actions up to old age and death—three gives rise to two, two gives rise to seven, seven gives rise to three—mutually conditioning, affliction‑karma causation and karma‑suffering causation, impermanent arising and ceasing. The *Madhyamaka* judges this as teaching for dull roots. The *Nirvāṇa* calls it the diligent half‑word. This sutra says: "Only separating from falsity is called liberation." Therefore we know this realm is coarse. If the nature and marks of ignorance originally do not exist, and through deluded thinking and conditions they combine and appear, the realm being like illusion, wisdom also cannot be obtained. The sutra says: "If there is any dharma beyond nirvāṇa, I also say it is like illusion, like magic." The *Madhyamaka* clarifies teaching for sharp roots. The *Nirvāṇa* calls it the elder's teaching. The *Vijñapti* treatise and *Da Pin* call it "skillfully ferrying according to reality"; this sutra calls it the small tree. This realm is skillful. If ignorance is the condition, from the condition arises mark, from mark there is birth, from birth therefore decay. Extinguishing the condition yields purity; removing the mark yields self; exhausting birth yields bliss; without decay yields permanence. The *Madhyamaka* says: "A dharma arisen from conditions is also called a provisional name." The *Da Pin* calls "the twelve links" the dharma of bodhisattvas alone. The *Nirvāṇa* calls it that by extinguishing ignorance one attains blazing [wisdom]. This sutra is the great tree and thereby increases. Compared to the previous, it is subtle; compared to the later, it is coarse. If one says the three paths of ignorance are the three virtues, there is no need to cut the three virtues and seek the three virtues anew. The *Madhyamaka* says: "A dharma arisen from conditions is also called the meaning of the Middle Way." The *Da Pin* says the twelve links are the seat of the Way‑place. The *Nirvāṇa* says: "Between ignorance and craving—this is the Middle Way." This sutra says: "The Buddha‑seed arises from dependent origination; therefore it speaks the One Vehicle." It is also called the most real matter. Is this not subtle? The first three are provisional, thus coarse; the last is real, thus subtle. Using this coarse/subtle through the five‑flavor teachings: in the milk teaching there are two kinds of dependent origination, one coarse and one subtle. The curd teaching has one coarse. The fresh‑curd teaching has three coarse and one subtle. The mature‑curd teaching has two coarse and one subtle. The *Lotus* teaches only one subtle. This is called using coarse dependent origination to clarify subtle dependent origination.

三、開麁顯妙者，如經：「我法妙難思」，前三皆是佛法，豈有思議之麁異不思議之妙？無離文字說解脫義，秖體思議即不思議。譬如長者，引盆器米麵給與窮子，成窮子物。若定天性，窮子非復客作人，盆器還家，安是他物？如來於不思議方便說麁，何得保麁異妙？今決了聲聞法，是諸經之王。即是開兩因緣，即論於妙。又《大經》云：「為諸聲聞開發慧眼」者，昔慧眼但見於空，不見不空。今開慧眼，即見不空，不空即見佛性。故云：「慧眼見故，而不了了；佛以佛眼，見則了了。」此即決菩薩慧眼，開第三因緣，即絕待論於妙。

> Third, opening the coarse to reveal the subtle: as the sutra says, "My dharma is subtle and hard to conceive." The first three are all Buddha‑dharma—how could there be a coarse difference of the conceivable versus the subtle of the inconceivable? There is no liberation meaning apart from words; precisely the conceivable is the inconceivable. It is like an elder who brings basins, vessels, rice, and flour to give to a poor son, making them the poor son's things. If one fixes a heavenly nature, the poor son is no longer a hired worker; the basins and vessels return home—how could they be another's things? The Tathāgata speaks the coarse within inconceivable expedients; how can one hold the coarse as different from the subtle? Now, deciding the śrāvaka dharma is the king of all sūtras: this is opening the two dependent originations and then speaking the subtle. Again the *Nirvāṇa* says: "For the śrāvakas, he opens the wisdom eye." Formerly the wisdom eye only saw emptiness, not non‑emptiness. Now opening the wisdom eye, one sees non‑emptiness; non‑emptiness is precisely seeing Buddha‑nature. Therefore it says: "Seeing with the wisdom eye, yet not clearly; the Buddha with the Buddha eye sees clearly." This is to decide the bodhisattva's wisdom eye, opening the third dependent origination—thus the subtle is discussed in absolute terms.

四、觀心者，觀一念無明即是明。《大經》云：「無明明者，即畢竟空。」空慧照無明，無明即淨。譬如有人，覺知有賊，賊無能為。既不為無明所染，即是煩惱道淨。煩惱淨故則無業，無業故無縛，無縛故是自在我。我既自在，不為業縛，誰受是名色、觸、受？無受則無苦。既無苦陰，誰復遷滅？即是常德。一念之心既具十二因緣，觀此因緣，恒作常、樂、我、淨之觀。其心念念住祕密藏中恒作此觀，名託聖胎。觀行純熟，胎分成就。若破無明，名出聖胎(云云)。

> Fourth, contemplating the mind: contemplate that a single thought of ignorance is precisely bright. The *Nirvāṇa* says: "Ignorance that is bright is precisely ultimate emptiness." Emptiness‑wisdom illuminates ignorance; ignorance is then pure. It is like someone who becomes aware of a thief; the thief can do nothing. Since one is not defiled by ignorance, this is the purification of the affliction‑path. When afflictions are purified, there is no karma; without karma there is no bondage; without bondage there is the self‑mastery self. When the self is self‑mastery, not bound by karma, who receives name‑and‑form, contact, and feeling? Without feeling there is no suffering. With no suffering aggregates, who then transmigrates and ceases? This is the virtue of permanence. In one thought, the mind already contains the twelve links; contemplating these links, one constantly contemplates permanence, bliss, self, and purity. If the mind in each thought abides in the secret treasury and constantly does this contemplation, it is called "entrusting the holy womb." When contemplative practice ripens, the womb's share is accomplished. If ignorance is broken, it is called "emerging from the holy womb" (and so on).

## 三、明四諦境
# 3. The Four Noble Truths Realm

---

三、明四諦境，為四：一、明四諦。二、判麁妙。三、開麁顯妙。四、觀心。初又二：一、出他解，二、四番四諦。有師解《勝鬘》無邊聖諦，對二乘有餘，彰佛究竟。二乘是有作四聖諦，作者，有量四聖諦也。無作四聖諦者，無量四聖諦也。作、無作就行；量、無量就法。二乘觀諦，得法不盡，更有所作，故名有作。得法不盡，則有限量。經言：「因他知，知是有作行也。」因他知，非一切知，不知無量法也，故言有作、有量。無作、無量者，佛知無窮盡，更無所作，故名無作。自力知一切，知者無作行也。一切者，是無量法也。如此釋者，雖唱四名，但成二義，非今所用。

> Third, clarifying the Four Truths Realm has four parts: (1) clarifying the Four Truths, (2) judging coarse and subtle, (3) opening the coarse to reveal the subtle, (4) contemplating the mind. The first has two: (1) presenting others' explanations, (2) the fourfold Four Truths. Some teachers explain the *Śrīmālā*'s boundless noble truths, contrasting the Two Vehicles' with‑remainder to manifest the Buddha's ultimate. The Two Vehicles are the "with‑action" four noble truths; "with‑action" are the limited four noble truths. The "without‑action" four noble truths are the immeasurable four noble truths. With/without action are in terms of practice; limited/immeasurable are in terms of dharmas. The Two Vehicles contemplate the truths; their attainment of dharmas is not exhaustive, and there is still something to do, therefore called with‑action. Because attainment of dharmas is not exhaustive, there is limitation. The sutra says: "Knowing through another—this knowing is with‑action practice." Knowing through another is not all‑knowledge; it does not know immeasurable dharmas, therefore it is called with‑action and limited. Without‑action and immeasurable: the Buddha's knowing is inexhaustible, with nothing further to do, therefore called without‑action. Knowing all by one's own power: that knowing is without‑action practice; "all" is immeasurable dharmas. Such explanations, though they speak four names, only make two meanings and are not what we use now.

### The Four Types of Four Noble Truths

四種四諦者：一、生滅。二、無生滅。三、無量。四、無作。其義出《涅槃．聖行品》，約偏、圓、事、理分四種之殊。

> **The Four Types of Four Noble Truths:**
> 1. **Arising-and-Ceasing** (生滅)
> 2. **Non-Arising** (無生滅)
> 3. **Immeasurable** (無量)
> 4. **Without-Action** (無作)

Their meaning comes from the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*, "Sacred Conduct Chapter," distinguished into four kinds according to partial/complete and phenomenal/principle.

---

#### 3.1 Arising-and-Ceasing Four Noble Truths (生滅四諦)

所言生滅者，迷真重故，從事受名。

> What is called "Arising-and-Ceasing": because confusion about truth is heavy, [this teaching] receives its name from phenomena.

然苦、集是一法，分因、果成兩；道、滅亦然。《雜心》偈云：「諸行果性，是說苦諦。因性說集諦；一切有漏法究竟滅，說滅諦；一切無漏行，說道諦。」

> Yet suffering and accumulation are one dharma, divided into cause and fruit as two; path and cessation are also thus. The *Zaxin* verse says: "The fruit‑nature of all conditioned acts is called the Truth of Suffering. Their cause‑nature is called the Truth of Accumulation. The ultimate cessation of all contaminated dharmas is called the Truth of Cessation. All uncontaminated practices are called the Truth of the Path."

《大經》云：「陰入重檐，逼迫繫縛，是苦諦。見愛煩惱，能招來果，是集諦。戒、定、慧、無常、苦、空，能除苦本，是道諦。二十五有子、果縛斷，是滅諦。」

> The *Mahāyāna Parinirvāṇa* says: "The aggregates and sense-fields, layered burdens, oppressing and binding—this is **Suffering**. Views and craving, afflictions that can bring future fruit—this is **Accumulation**. Discipline, concentration, wisdom, impermanence, suffering, emptiness, able to remove the root of suffering—this is the **Path**. The offspring-bondage and fruit-bondage of the twenty-five existences cut off—this is **Cessation**."

《遺教》云：「集真是因，更無別因。滅苦之道，即是真道。」此皆明生滅四聖諦相也。

> The *Bequeathed Teachings* says: "Accumulation is truly the cause; there is no other cause. The path that extinguishes suffering is precisely the true path." These all clarify the marks of the arising‑and‑ceasing four noble truths.

次第者，從麁至細。苦相麁故先說，滅雖非真，因滅會真，滅相麁亦先說。又舉世苦果，令厭世集。滅能會出世果，令其欣道。作如此次第也。

> As for the sequence: from coarse to subtle. The mark of suffering is coarse, therefore spoken first. Though cessation is not true, by cessation one meets truth; the mark of cessation is coarse and thus also spoken first. Again, raising the world's suffering fruit makes one loathe worldly accumulation; cessation can meet the supramundane fruit, making one delight in the path. This is the sequence.

聖者對破邪法，故言正聖也。諦者有三解(云云)：謂自性不虛，故稱為諦。又見此四得不顛倒覺，故稱為諦。又能以此法顯示於他，故名為諦。《大經》：「凡夫有苦，無諦。聲聞、緣覺有苦，有苦諦。」當知凡夫不見聖理，不得智，不能說，但苦無諦。聲聞具三義，故稱為諦。此釋與經合也。

> "Saint" counters and breaks wrong dharmas; therefore it is called true saint. "Truth" has three explanations (and so on): its own nature is not false, therefore it is called truth; seeing these four, one attains non‑inverted awakening, therefore it is called truth; and being able to manifest this dharma to others, it is called truth. The *Mahāyāna Parinirvāṇa* says: "Ordinary people have suffering but no truth. Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas have suffering and have the truth of suffering." You should know that ordinary people do not see the noble principle, do not attain wisdom, cannot speak it; they have suffering but no truth. Śrāvakas possess the three meanings and therefore are called truths. This explanation accords with the sutra.

---

#### 3.2 Non-Arising Four Noble Truths (無生四諦)

無生者，迷真輕故，從理得名。苦，無逼迫相；集，無和合相；道，不二相；滅，無生相。

> "Non-Arising": because confusion about truth is light, [this teaching] receives its name from principle. **Suffering has no mark of oppression; Accumulation has no mark of combination; the Path has no mark of duality; Cessation has no mark of arising.**

又，習應苦空，三亦如是。又，無生者，生名集、道。集、道即空。空故不生集、道。集、道不生則無苦、滅，即事而真，非滅後真。

> Moreover, practice corresponds to suffering and emptiness; the other three are also thus. Again, in non‑arising: "arising" names accumulation and the path. Accumulation and the path are precisely emptiness. Because empty, accumulation and the path do not arise. When accumulation and the path do not arise, there is no suffering or cessation; it is true in the very thing, not truth after cessation.

《大經》云：「諸菩薩等解苦無苦，是故無苦而有真諦。」三亦如是。

> The *Mahāyāna Parinirvāṇa* says: "Bodhisattvas understand suffering as non-suffering; therefore there is no suffering yet there is true principle." The [other] three are also thus.

是故名為無生四聖諦。聖諦義，如前說。

> Therefore it is called the non‑arising four noble truths. The meaning of noble truth is as explained above.

---

#### 3.3 Immeasurable Four Noble Truths (無量四諦)

無量者，迷中重故，從事得名。苦有無量相，十法界果不同故。集有無量相，五住煩惱不同故。道有無量相，恒沙佛法不同故。滅有無量相，諸波羅蜜不同故。

> "Immeasurable": because confusion within [the middle way] is heavy, [this teaching] receives its name from phenomena. **Suffering has immeasurable marks because the fruits of the ten Dharma-Realms differ. Accumulation has immeasurable marks because the five-dwelling afflictions differ. The Path has immeasurable marks because Buddha-dharmas [numerous as] Ganges sands differ. Cessation has immeasurable marks because the *pāramitās* differ.**

《大經》云：「知諸陰苦，名為中智。分別諸陰，有無量相，非諸聲聞、緣覺所知。我於彼經，竟不說之。」

> The *Mahāyāna Parinirvāṇa* says: "To know the suffering of the aggregates is called middle wisdom. To distinguish that the aggregates have immeasurable marks—this is not known by Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas. In those sūtras, I never spoke of it."

三亦如是。是名無量四聖諦。

> The other three are also thus. This is called the immeasurable four noble truths.

---

#### 3.4 Without-Action Four Noble Truths (無作四諦)

無作者，迷中輕故，從理得名。以迷理故，菩提是煩惱，名集諦。涅槃是生死，名苦諦。以能解故，煩惱即菩提，名道諦。生死即涅槃，名滅諦。

> "Without-Action": because confusion within [the middle way] is light, [this teaching] receives its name from principle. **Due to confusion about principle, *bodhi* is affliction—called Accumulation. *Nirvāṇa* is birth-and-death—called Suffering. Due to understanding, affliction is precisely *bodhi*—called the Path. Birth-and-death is precisely *nirvāṇa*—called Cessation.**

即事而中，無思無念，無誰造作，故名無作。

> Precisely phenomena are the Middle; no thought, no conception, no one creating—hence called "Without-Action."

《大經》云：「世諦即是第一義諦。有善方便，隨順眾生，說有二諦。出世人知即第一義諦。」

> The *Mahāyāna Parinirvāṇa* says: "Conventional truth is precisely ultimate truth. Through skillful means, following sentient beings, we speak of two truths. Those who transcend the world know it is precisely ultimate truth."

一實諦者，無虛妄、無顛倒、常樂我淨等，是故名為無作四聖諦。

> The one real truth has no falsity, no inversion, permanence, bliss, self, and purity, and so on; therefore it is called the without‑action four noble truths.

然《勝鬘》說無作四諦中，別取一滅諦，是佛所究竟，是常、是諦、是依，三是無常，非諦，非依。何者？三入有為相中，故無常。無常則虛妄，故非諦。無常則不安，故非依。滅諦離有為，故是常。非虛妄，故是諦。第一安隱，故是依。故名第一義諦，亦名不思議也。

> In the *Śrīmālā*'s explanation of the without‑action four truths, it separately takes the Cessation Truth as the Buddha's ultimate; it is constant, it is truth, it is reliance, while the other three are impermanent, not truth, not reliance. Why? The three enter the marks of conditioned dharmas, therefore are impermanent. Impermanence is falsity, therefore not truth. Impermanence is not peace, therefore not reliance. The Cessation Truth departs from the conditioned, therefore is constant. Not false, therefore is truth. The foremost peace, therefore is reliance. Hence it is called the First‑Meaning Truth, also called inconceivable.

達摩欝多羅難此義：然經說佛菩提道，三義故常。一、惑盡故常；二、不從煩惱生故常；三、解滿故常，如眾流歸海。那云道諦無常？

> Dharmottara challenges this meaning: the sutra speaks of the Buddha's bodhi‑path as constant for three reasons—(1) constant because delusions are exhausted; (2) constant because it does not arise from afflictions; (3) constant because understanding is complete, like all streams returning to the sea. How can one say the Path Truth is impermanent?

答：《勝鬘》作此說者，前苦滅諦，非壞法滅。無始、無作等，過恒沙佛法成就。說如來法身，不離煩惱藏。說苦諦，隱名如來藏，顯名為法身。二乘空智，於四不顛倒境界，不見不知。今欲顯說，說一是常、是實、是依。有對治、除障、身顯，故明三非常、非實，一是常、是實耳。

> Answer: when *Śrīmālā* makes this explanation, the earlier Suffering and Cessation truths are not the destruction of dharmas; from beginningless and without‑action, the Buddha‑dharma accomplished beyond Ganges sands. It speaks of the Tathāgata's Dharma‑body as not apart from the affliction‑store. Speaking of the Truth of Suffering, it hides the name "tathāgata‑store" and reveals the name "Dharma‑body." The Two Vehicles' emptiness‑wisdom, regarding the four non‑inverted realms, do not see and do not know. Now, in order to reveal, it says one is constant, real, and reliance. With countermeasure, removing obstacles, and the body manifesting, therefore it clarifies the three as not constant and not real; only the one is constant and real.

今難：若爾，一諦顯，是無作諦，三諦未顯，非無作諦。一是了義，三非了義。當知《勝鬘》所說，說於次第，從淺至深，歷別未融，乃是無量四諦中之無作，非是發心畢竟二不別之無作。《涅槃》云：「有諦有實」，當知四種，皆稱諦、稱實、稱常也。

> Now the difficulty: if so, when the one truth is revealed, it is the without‑action truth; the three truths are not revealed and are not without‑action truths. The one is definitive; the three are not definitive. You should know that what *Śrīmālā* says is a sequential teaching, from shallow to deep, passing through distinctions not yet fused; it is the without‑action within the immeasurable four truths, not the without‑action where initial resolve and ultimate are not two. The *Nirvāṇa* says: "There are truths and there are realities"; you should know that the four kinds are all called truth, called real, and called constant.

---

二、判麁妙者，大小乘論諦，不出此四。或教、行、證不融者為麁；教融，行、證未融，亦麁；俱融者則妙。若約五味者，乳教兩種，二乘並不聞，以大隔小，則一麁一妙。酪教一種，大乘所不用，以小隔大，根敗聾啞，是故為麁。生蘇教四種：一破三，二不入二。一雖入，一教不融，故三麁一妙。熟蘇教三種：一破二，一入一，一不入一。一雖入一，教不融，故二麁一妙。醍醐教，但一種四諦，唯妙無麁。是為待麁明妙(云云)。

> Second, judging coarse and subtle: Great and Small Vehicle discussions of the truths do not go beyond these four. If teaching, practice, and realization are not fused, it is coarse; if the teaching is fused but practice and realization are not fused, it is also coarse; if all are fused, it is subtle. If according to the five flavors: in the milk teaching there are two kinds; the Two Vehicles do not hear them, because the Great separates from the Small, thus one coarse and one subtle. The curd teaching has one kind; the Great Vehicle does not use it, because the Small separates from the Great; roots are ruined and deaf and dumb, therefore it is coarse. The fresh‑curd teaching has four kinds: one breaks three, two do not enter two. One enters one, yet the teaching is not fused, therefore three coarse and one subtle. The mature‑curd teaching has three kinds: one breaks two, one enters one, one does not enter one. One enters one, yet the teaching is not fused, therefore two coarse and one subtle. The ghee teaching has only one kind of four truths, only subtle and no coarse. This is called waiting on the coarse to clarify the subtle (and so on).

三、開麁顯妙者，先敘諸經意。《大品》止明三種四諦。文云：「色即是空，非色滅空」，無生意也。「一切法趣色，是趣不過」，無量意也。「色尚不可得，何況有趣、有不趣」，無作意也。《中論》偈亦有三意，後兩品明小乘觀法，即生滅意也。《無量義》明一中出無量，是從無作開出三種四諦也。《法華》明無量入一，是會三種四諦，歸無作一種四諦也。《涅槃．聖行》，追分別眾經，故具說四種四諦也。〈德王品〉追泯眾經，俱寂四種四諦。文云：「生生不可說；生不生不可說；不生生不可說；不生不生不可說。」經釋初句云：「云何生生不可說？生生故生，生生故不生，故不可說。」若依文，但舉生不生釋生生，此之生生即生不生，那可偏作生生而說？佛為利根人舉一而例諸。若取意者，生生即生不生，亦即不生生，亦即不生不生，那可偏作生生一句而說！若得此意，下三句例皆如此。

> Third, opening the coarse to reveal the subtle: first narrate the intent of the various sūtras. The *Da Pin* only clarifies three kinds of four truths. It says: "Form is precisely emptiness; it is not that form is extinguished into emptiness"—the non‑arising meaning. "All dharmas converge on form; this convergence does not go beyond"—the immeasurable meaning. "Form itself is unobtainable; how much more is there convergence or non‑convergence"—the without‑action meaning. The *Madhyamaka* verse also has three meanings; the latter two chapters clarify the Small Vehicle's contemplation of dharmas—this is the arising‑and‑ceasing meaning. The *Infinite Meaning* clarifies that within the one emerges the immeasurable; this opens the three kinds of four truths from the without‑action. The *Lotus* clarifies that the immeasurable enters the one; this combines the three kinds of four truths and returns to the one kind of without‑action four truths. The *Nirvāṇa* "Sacred Conduct" chapter traces and distinguishes the various sūtras, therefore fully speaks the four kinds of four truths. The "Virtue King" chapter traces and extinguishes the various sūtras, together quiescing the four kinds of four truths. The text says: "Arising arising cannot be spoken; arising non‑arising cannot be spoken; non‑arising arising cannot be spoken; non‑arising non‑arising cannot be spoken." The sutra explains the first line: "How is 'arising arising cannot be spoken'? Because arising‑arising is arising, arising‑arising is non‑arising, therefore it cannot be spoken." If one follows the text, it only takes arising/non‑arising to explain arising‑arising; this arising‑arising is precisely arising‑non‑arising—how could one partialize and speak only of arising‑arising? The Buddha, for sharp‑rooted people, raises one to exemplify the rest. If one takes the meaning, arising‑arising is precisely arising‑non‑arising, and also non‑arising‑arising, and also non‑arising‑non‑arising—how could one partialize and speak only the line of arising‑arising? If one grasps this meaning, the following three lines are all like this.

問：

> **Question:**

佛何故作偏釋耶？

> Why does the Buddha give a partial explanation?

答：

> **Answer:**

為利根故，亦是有因緣故，宜須如此。時眾如快馬見鞭影，不俟徹骨耳。如此追泯，何說而不寂耶！

> Because it is for sharp roots, and also because there are causes and conditions, it should be thus. The assembly at that time was like a fast horse seeing the shadow of the whip, not waiting for it to pierce the bone. With such tracing‑and‑extinguishing, what can be spoken that is not quiescent?

或三種可說為麁，一可說為妙。或三不可說為麁，一不可說為妙。或四皆可說為麁，四皆不可說為妙。或四可說有麁有妙。或四不可說有麁有妙。或四可說皆非麁非妙。或四不可說皆非麁非妙。如是等種種，皆決了入妙，開權顯實。四皆不可說，是位高。四皆可說，是體廣。四亦可說亦不可說，是用長。四非可說非不可說，是非高非廣、非長非短、非一非異，同稱為妙也。

> Perhaps the three that can be spoken are coarse and the one that can be spoken is subtle; or the three that cannot be spoken are coarse and the one that cannot be spoken is subtle; or all four that can be spoken are coarse and all four that cannot be spoken are subtle; or among the four that can be spoken there are coarse and subtle; or among the four that cannot be spoken there are coarse and subtle; or all four that can be spoken are neither coarse nor subtle; or all four that cannot be spoken are neither coarse nor subtle. Thus various kinds all decisively enter the subtle, opening the provisional and revealing the real. The four that cannot be spoken are high in position. The four that can be spoken are broad in substance. The four that are both speakable and unspeakable are long in function. The four that are neither speakable nor unspeakable are neither high nor broad, neither long nor short, neither one nor different, and are all called subtle.

觀心可知，不復記也。

> Contemplating the mind can be known; it is not recorded again.

## 四、明二諦境
# 4. The Two Truths Realm

---

### The Difficulty of Understanding Two Truths

夫二諦者，名出眾經，而其理難曉，世間紛紜，由來碩諍。

> The Two Truths—their name appears in many sūtras, but their principle is difficult to understand. The world is confused; there have long been great disputes.

《妙勝定經》云：「佛昔與文殊，共諍二諦，俱墮地獄。至迦葉佛時，共質所疑。」二聖因地尚不能了，況即人情強生去取？

> The *Subtle Victory Samādhi Sūtra* says: "The Buddha and Mañjuśrī once debated the Two Truths and both fell into hell. At the time of Kāśyapa Buddha, they together resolved their doubts." If even two sages in their causal stage could not understand, how much more [difficult for] ordinary human sentiment forcibly selecting [views]!

問：

> **Question:**

釋迦值迦葉，即是二生菩薩，云何始解二諦？爾前復不應墮惡道！

> Śākyamuni meeting Kāśyapa is a two‑birth bodhisattva; how could he only then first understand the Two Truths? Earlier he should not have fallen into an evil path!

答：

> **Answer:**

爾前語寬，何必齊二生之前始惡道出？又，二生菩薩將隣補處，補處位多別、圓，永無此理。通教見地已免惡道，亦無墮落。應是三藏菩薩，至二生時，猶未斷惑，始解二諦，此義無咎。爾前墮惡道，亦有其義。

> The earlier wording is broad; how must one set it only to before the two births as the time of emerging from evil paths? Moreover, the two‑birth bodhisattva is nearing the one‑birth‑to‑go position; that position is many in the Distinct and Perfect teachings, so there is never such a principle. In the Common Teaching, seeing the ground already avoids evil paths and there is no falling. It should be that the Tripiṭaka bodhisattva, by the time of two births, has not yet cut delusions and only then understands the Two Truths; this meaning has no fault. As for earlier falling into evil paths, there is also that meaning.

問：

> **Question:**

三藏菩薩有墮落，餘三教無者，《金光明經》那云「十地猶有虎、狼、師子等怖」耶？

> If Tripiṭaka bodhisattvas have falling and the other three teachings do not, why does the *Suvarṇaprabhāsa* say, "Even the ten bhūmis still have fears of tigers, wolves, lions, and so on"?

答：

> **Answer:**

為惡友殺則墮地獄，為惡象殺不墮地獄。然圓教肉身於一生中有超登十地之義，此則煩惱已破，無地獄業，猶有肉身，未免惡獸。餘教肉身，一生之中，不登十地，唯作行解，以煩惱為虎狼。作行解者，於理則通，於事不去(云云)。

> If killed by evil friends, one falls into hell; if killed by a vicious elephant, one does not fall into hell. In the Perfect Teaching, the flesh body within one life has the meaning of surpassing and ascending the ten bhūmis; then afflictions are already broken and there is no hell karma, yet there is still a flesh body and one is not free of fierce beasts. In the other teachings, the flesh body in one life does not ascend to the ten bhūmis; it only makes practice‑understanding, taking afflictions as tigers and wolves. For practice‑understanding, in principle it is accessible, in matters it does not depart (and so on).

然執者不同，莊嚴旻據佛果出二諦外，為中論師所覈：如此佛智照何理？破何惑？若無別理可照，不應出外；若出外而無別照者，藉何得出？進不成三，退不成二(云云)。梁世《成論》執世諦不同。或言世諦名、用、體皆有；或但名、用而無於體；或但有名而無體、用(云云)。陳世《中論》，破立不同。或破古來二十三家明二諦義，自立二諦義。或破他竟，約四假明二諦。古今異執，各引證據，自保一文，不信餘說。

> Those who cling differ. Zhuangyan Min holds that the Buddha‑fruit is outside the Two Truths and is questioned by the Madhyamaka masters: if so, what principle does Buddha‑wisdom illuminate? What delusion does it break? If there is no distinct principle to illuminate, it should not be outside; if it is outside and has no distinct illumination, by what does it go outside? Advancing, it does not make three; retreating, it does not make two (and so on). In the Liang period, the *Cheng‑lun* held different views of conventional truth: some say conventional truth has name, function, and substance; some say it has name and function but no substance; some say it has only name and no substance or function (and so on). In the Chen period, *Madhyamaka* has different refutations and assertions: some refute the twenty‑three schools' Two‑Truths meanings and establish their own; some refute others to the end and, based on the four provisories, clarify Two Truths. Ancient and modern hold different attachments, each citing evidence, each protecting one text and not trusting other explanations.

### Three Ways of Speaking Two Truths

今謂不爾。夫經論異說，悉是如來善權方便，知根知欲，種種不同，略有三異，謂隨情、情智、智等。

> We now say it is not so. The various explanations in sūtras and treatises are all the Tathāgata's skillful expedient means, knowing roots and desires, with various differences. Briefly, there are **three different [approaches]**: following feeling (隨情), feeling‑and‑wisdom (情智), and following wisdom (智).

隨情說者，情性不同，說隨情異。如《毘婆沙》明：世第一法有無量種。際真尚爾，況復餘耶！如順盲情，種種示乳。盲聞異說而諍，白色豈即乳耶？眾師不達此意，各執一文，自起見諍，互相是非，信一不信一，浩浩亂哉，莫知孰是。若二十三說及能破者，有經文證，皆判是隨情二諦意耳。無文證者，悉是邪謂，同彼外道，非二諦攝也。隨情智者，情謂二諦，二皆是俗。若悟諦理乃可為真，真則唯一。如五百比丘各說身因，身因乃多，正理唯一。經云：「世人心所見，名為世諦。出世人心所見，名第一義諦。」如此說者，即隨情智二諦也。隨智者，聖人悟理，非但見真亦能了俗。如眼除膜，見色見空。又如入禪者出觀之時，身心虛豁，似輕雲靄空，已不同散心，何況悟真而不了俗。《毘曇》云：「小雲發障，大雲發障，無漏逾深，世智轉淨故。」經言：「凡人行世間，不知世間相；如來行世間，明了世間相。」此是隨智二諦也。若解此三意，將尋經論，雖說種種，於一一諦皆備三意也。

> Following feeling: dispositions differ, and the explanation follows feelings and differs. As *Vibhāṣā* explains: the supreme worldly dharma has immeasurable kinds—if even the ultimate truth is so, how much more the rest! It is like accommodating the feelings of the blind, showing milk in various ways. The blind hear differing explanations and argue—how could white be milk? The many teachers do not grasp this intent; each clings to one text and raises disputes, mutually affirming and denying, believing one and not another; a great confusion—who knows which is right? If the twenty‑three explanations and those who refute them have sutra evidence, all are judged as the Two Truths of following feeling. Those without scriptural evidence are all wrong claims, like non‑Buddhists, and are not encompassed by the Two Truths. Following feeling‑and‑wisdom: feeling is taken as the Two Truths, both are conventional. Only when one awakens to the truth principle can it be true, and truth is only one. It is like five hundred bhikṣus each explaining the cause of the body; the causes are many, the correct principle is one. The sutra says: "What worldly people's minds see is called conventional truth; what supramundane people's minds see is called first‑meaning truth." Such a statement is the Two Truths of following feeling‑and‑wisdom. Following wisdom: sages awaken to principle; not only seeing truth, they can also understand conventional. It is like an eye with a film removed, seeing form and seeing emptiness. Again, like someone entering meditation: when emerging from contemplation, body and mind are open and empty, like light clouds and mist in the sky, already different from a scattered mind—how much more awakening to truth and not understanding the conventional! *Vibhāṣā* says: "Small clouds give rise to obstruction; great clouds give rise to obstruction; the deeper the outflow‑free [wisdom], the purer the worldly wisdom." The sutra says: "Ordinary people go in the world and do not know the world's marks; the Tathāgata goes in the world and clearly knows the world's marks." This is the Two Truths of following wisdom. If one understands these three meanings and then searches the sutras and treatises, although they speak variously, each truth contains all three meanings.

### The Seven Types of Two Truths

二、正明二諦者，取意存略，但點法性為真諦，無明十二因緣為俗諦，於義即足。但人心麁淺，不覺其深妙，更須開拓，則論七種二諦。一一二諦更開三種，合二十一二諦也。若用初番二諦破一切邪謂執著皆盡，如劫火燒，不留遺芥。況鋪後諸諦，逈出文外，非復世情圖度。

> Second, directly clarifying the Two Truths: taking the meaning and keeping it brief, one only points to dharma‑nature as the true truth, and ignorance with the twelve links as the conventional truth; in meaning this suffices. But people's minds are coarse and shallow and do not awaken to its depth and subtlety; it must be further developed, thus speaking of seven kinds of Two Truths. Each Two Truths further opens three kinds, totaling twenty‑one Two Truths. If one uses the first set of Two Truths to break all wrong claims and attachments, all are exhausted, like kalpa‑fire burning, leaving no remnant. How much more when later truths are laid out, far beyond the text, no longer within ordinary sentiment's capacity to measure.

所言七種二諦者，一者、實有為俗；實有滅為真。二者、幻有為俗；即幻有空為真。三者、幻有為俗；即幻有空不空共為真。四者、幻有為俗；幻有即空不空，一切法趣空不空為真。五者、幻有、幻有即空，皆名為俗；不有不空為真。六者、幻有、幻有即空，皆名為俗；不有不空一切法趣不有不空為真。七者、幻有、幻有即空，皆為俗；一切法趣有、趣空、趣不有不空為真。

> The seven kinds of Two Truths are: (1) real existence is conventional; real extinction is true. (2) Illusory existence is conventional; the emptiness of illusory existence is true. (3) Illusory existence is conventional; the combined emptiness‑and‑not‑emptiness of illusory existence is true. (4) Illusory existence is conventional; illusory existence itself is empty‑and‑not‑empty; all dharmas converge on empty‑and‑not‑empty as true. (5) Illusory existence and illusory‑existence‑as‑empty are both called conventional; not‑existent and not‑empty is true. (6) Illusory existence and illusory‑existence‑as‑empty are both called conventional; all dharmas converge on not‑existent‑not‑empty as true. (7) Illusory existence and illusory‑existence‑as‑empty are all conventional; all dharmas converge on existence, convergence on emptiness, and convergence on neither‑existent‑nor‑empty as true.

---

#### Type 1: Real Existence Two Truths (實有二諦)

實有二諦者，陰、入、界等皆是實法。實法所成，森羅萬品，故名為俗。方便修道，滅此俗已，乃得會真。

> **Real Existence Two Truths**: The aggregates, sense-bases, and elements are all real dharmas. What real dharmas constitute, the myriad forms of the world, is called conventional. Through expedient path-cultivation, having extinguished this conventional, one can then realize truth.

《大品》云：「空色、色空」，以滅俗故謂為「空色」；不滅色故謂為「色空」。

> The *Prajñāpāramitā* says: "Emptying form, form is empty." Because conventional is extinguished, it is called "emptying form"; not extinguishing form, it is called "form is empty."

病中無藥，文字中無菩提，皆是此意。

> "Within sickness there is no medicine; within written words there is no *bodhi*"—all are this meaning.

---

#### Type 2: Illusory Existence Two Truths (幻有空二諦)

幻有空二諦者，斥前意也。何者？實有時無真，滅有時無俗，二諦義不成。

> **Illusory Existence Two Truths** refutes the former meaning. Why? When [dharmas] really exist, there is no truth; when existence is extinguished, there is no conventional. The meaning of Two Truths is not established.

若明幻有者，幻有是俗，幻有不可得，即俗而真。《大品》云：「即色是空，即空是色。」空色相即，二諦義成。

> If one clarifies illusory existence: illusory existence is conventional; illusory existence being unobtainable—precisely conventional is truth. The *Prajñāpāramitā* says: "**Precisely form is emptiness, precisely emptiness is form.**" Emptiness and form being mutually identical, the meaning of Two Truths is established.

是名幻有無二諦也。約此，亦有隨情、情智、智等三義(云云)。隨智小當分別。何者？實有隨智照真，與此不異，隨智照俗不同。何者？通人入觀巧，復局照俗亦巧。如百川會海，其味不別；復局還源，江河則異。俗是事法，照異非疑。真是理法，不可不同。秖就通人出假，亦人人不同，可以意得。例三藏出假，亦應如是(云云)。

> This is called the illusory‑existence non‑two truths. With respect to this, there are also three meanings—following feeling, feeling‑and‑wisdom, and wisdom (and so on). For following wisdom, there is a slight distinction. What is it? In real‑existence, following‑wisdom illuminates the true; it is not different from this, but following‑wisdom illuminating the conventional is different. What is it? Common people enter contemplation skillfully, and again their focused illumination of the conventional is also skillful. It is like all rivers flowing into the sea—their flavor is not different; but when they return to their sources, rivers and streams are different. The conventional is dharmas of phenomena; illuminating differences is not doubtful. The true is dharmas of principle; it must not be different. Just in the Common teaching's emergence from provisional, people differ; it can be understood by meaning. By analogy, the Tripiṭaka's emergence from provisional should also be like this (and so on).

#### Type 3: Illusory Existence + Empty/Not-Empty Two Truths (幻有空、不空二諦)

幻有空、不空二諦者。俗不異前，真則三種不同。一俗隨三真，即成三種二諦。其相云何？如《大品》明非漏非無漏。初、人謂「非漏」是非俗，「非無漏」是遣著。何者？行人緣無漏生著，如緣滅生使；破其著心，還入無漏。此是一番二諦也。次、人聞非漏非無漏，謂非二邊、別顯中理，中理為真。又是一番二諦。又、人聞非有漏非無漏，即知雙非，正顯中道。中道法界，力用廣大，與虛空等，一切法趣非有漏非無漏，又是一番二諦也。《大經》云：「聲聞之人但見於空，不見不空」「智者見空及與不空」即是此意。二乘謂著此空，破著空故，故言不空；空著若破，但是見空，不見不空也。利人謂不空是妙有，故言不空。利利人聞不空，謂是如來藏；一切法趣如來藏。還約空、不空，即有三種二諦也。

> As for illusory‑existence empty/not‑empty Two Truths: the conventional is not different from before; the true has three kinds of differences. One conventional following three true yields three kinds of Two Truths. What are their marks? As *Da Pin* clarifies "not‑leaking and not‑without‑leaking." First, people take "not‑leaking" as non‑conventional, and "not‑without‑leaking" as removing attachment. Why? Practitioners, conditioned by the un‑leaking, give rise to attachment, like being conditioned by cessation and giving rise to defilements; breaking that attached mind, they return to the un‑leaking. This is one round of Two Truths. Next, people hear not‑leaking and not‑without‑leaking, and take it as neither of the two extremes, separately revealing the Middle principle; the Middle principle is true. This is another round of Two Truths. Again, people hear not‑leaking and not‑without‑leaking and know the dual negation, directly revealing the Middle Way. The Middle Way dharma‑realm has vast power and function, equal to space; all dharmas converge on not‑leaking and not‑without‑leaking—this is yet another round of Two Truths. The *Mahāyāna Parinirvāṇa* says: "Śrāvakas only see emptiness and do not see not‑emptiness; the wise see emptiness and also not‑emptiness." This is that meaning. The Two Vehicles are attached to this emptiness; to break attachment to emptiness, therefore it speaks of not‑emptiness. If attachment to emptiness is broken, they only see emptiness and do not see not‑emptiness. Sharp people take not‑emptiness as wondrous existence, therefore speak of not‑emptiness. The sharpest people hear not‑emptiness and take it as the tathāgata‑store; all dharmas converge on the tathāgata‑store. Returning to emptiness and not‑emptiness, there are three kinds of Two Truths.

復次，約一切法趣非漏非無漏顯三種異者：初、人聞一切法趣非漏非無漏者，謂諸法不離空，周行十方界還是瓶處如。又、人聞趣知此中理須一切行來趣發之。又、人聞一切趣即非漏非無漏，具一切法也。是故說此一俗隨三真轉：或對單真，或對複真，或對不思議真。無量形勢，婉轉赴機，出沒利物，一一皆有隨情、情智、智等三義。若隨智證，俗隨智轉。智證偏真，即成通二諦：智證不空真，即成別入通二諦：智證一切趣不空真，即成圓入通二諦。三人入智不同，復局照俗亦異(云云)。何故？三人同聞二諦而取解各異者，此是不共般若與二乘共說，則淺深之殊耳。《大品》云：「有菩薩初發心與薩婆若相應；有菩薩初發心如遊戲神通，淨佛國土；有菩薩初發心即坐道場，為如佛。」即此意也。

> Furthermore, explaining three kinds of differences by "all dharmas converge on not‑leaking and not‑without‑leaking": first, when people hear that all dharmas converge on not‑leaking and not‑without‑leaking, they say all dharmas do not depart from emptiness; circling through the ten directions, the realms are still like being in a bottle. Second, when people hear convergence, they know that the principle here requires all practices to come and converge to manifest it. Third, when people hear that all convergence is precisely not‑leaking and not‑without‑leaking, it contains all dharmas. Therefore this one conventional follows three true and turns: either paired with single true, or paired with composite true, or paired with inconceivable true. Infinite configurations, bending to meet capacities, coming and going to benefit beings—each has the three meanings of following feeling, feeling‑and‑wisdom, and wisdom. If one verifies by following wisdom, the conventional follows wisdom and turns. Wisdom verifying partial true becomes Common Two Truths; wisdom verifying not‑empty true becomes Distinct‑entering‑Common Two Truths; wisdom verifying the all‑converging not‑empty true becomes Perfect‑entering‑Common Two Truths. The three persons enter wisdom differently, and their focused illumination of the conventional is also different (and so on). Why? The three persons hear the Two Truths alike yet take understanding differently because this is the non‑shared prajñā spoken in common with the Two Vehicles; there are differences of shallow and deep. *Da Pin* says: "Some bodhisattvas, at first arousing the mind, correspond to sarvajñā; some bodhisattvas, at first arousing the mind, are like playing with supernormal powers, purifying Buddha‑lands; some bodhisattvas, at first arousing the mind, sit at the Way‑place, being like the Buddha." This is that meaning.

#### Type 5: Illusory/Unconditioned Conventional, Not‑Exist‑Not‑Nonexist True (幻有、無為俗，不有不無為真)

幻有、無為俗，不有不無為真者：有、無二故為俗；中道不有、不無，不二為真。二乘聞此真、俗，俱皆不解，故如瘂、如聾。《大經》云：「我與彌勒共論世諦，五百聲聞謂說真諦。」即此意也。約此，亦有隨情、情智、智等(云云)。

> As for illusory‑existence and unconditioned as conventional, and not‑exist‑not‑nonexist as true: existence and nonexistence are two and therefore conventional; the Middle Way is neither existent nor non‑existent, not two, and therefore true. The Two Vehicles, hearing this true and conventional, do not understand either—like the mute and the deaf. The *Mahāyāna Parinirvāṇa* says: "Maitreya and I together discussed conventional truth; five hundred śrāvakas thought we were speaking of true truth." This is that meaning. With respect to this, there are also following feeling, feeling‑and‑wisdom, and wisdom (and so on).

#### Type 6: Perfect‑Entering‑Distinct Two Truths (圓入別二諦)

圓入別二諦者，俗與別同，真諦則異。別人謂：不空但理而已；欲顯此理，須緣修方便，故言「一切法趣不空」。圓人聞不空理，即知具一切佛法無有缺減，故言「一切趣不空」也。約此，亦有隨情等(云云)。

> In Perfect‑entering‑Distinct Two Truths, the conventional is the same as the Distinct, but the true truth differs. The Distinct say: not‑empty is only principle; to reveal this principle, one must condition it and cultivate expedients, therefore it is said "all dharmas converge on not‑empty." The Perfect hear the not‑empty principle and immediately know it contains all Buddha‑dharmas without lack, therefore it is said "all convergence is not‑empty." With respect to this, there are also following feeling and so on (and so on).

---

#### Type 7: Perfect Teaching Two Truths (圓教二諦)

圓教二諦者，直說不思議二諦也。真即是俗；俗即是真。如如意珠，珠以譬真，用以譬俗。即珠是用，即用是珠，不二而二，分真俗耳。

> **Perfect Teaching Two Truths** directly teach the inconceivable Two Truths. **Truth is precisely conventional; conventional is precisely truth.** It is like a wish-fulfilling jewel: the jewel likens truth; its function likens conventional. **Precisely the jewel is the function; precisely the function is the jewel—not two yet two, distinguishing truth and conventional.**

身子云：「佛以種種緣，譬喻巧言說。其心安如海，我聞疑網斷。」即其義焉。

> Śāriputra said: "The Buddha through various conditions, similes, and skillful words—his mind peaceful as the ocean—I heard and my net of doubt was cut." This is that meaning.

問：

> **Question:**

真俗應相對，云何不同耶？

> True and conventional should be opposed—how are they not different?

答：

> **Answer:**

此應四句：俗異真同；真異俗同；真俗異相對；真俗同相對。三藏與通，真同而俗異；二入通，真異而俗同；別，真、俗皆異而相對；圓入別，俗同真異；圓，真、俗不異而相對，不同而同。若不相入，當分真、俗，即相對(云云)。

> This should be four statements: conventional different and true same; true different and conventional same; true and conventional different and opposed; true and conventional same and opposed. Tripiṭaka and Common: true same and conventional different. The two entering Common: true different and conventional same. Distinct: true and conventional both different and opposed. Perfect entering Distinct: conventional same, true different. Perfect: true and conventional not different and opposed, not different yet same. If they do not mutually enter, then separately divide true and conventional, and they are opposed (and so on).

七種二諦廣說如前。略說者，界內相即、不相即，界外相即、不相即，四種二諦也。別接通，五也。圓接通，六也。圓接別，七也。

> The seven kinds of Two Truths are explained above in detail. In brief: within‑realm identity and non‑identity, beyond‑realm identity and non‑identity—four kinds of Two Truths. Distinct connecting Common makes five. Perfect connecting Common makes six. Perfect connecting Distinct makes seven.

問：

> **Question:**

何不接三藏？

> Why not connect the Tripiṭaka?

答：

> **Answer:**

三藏是界內不相即，小乘取證，根敗之士，故不論接。餘六是摩訶衍門，若欲前進，亦可得去，是故被接。

> The Tripiṭaka is within‑realm non‑identity; the Small Vehicle takes realization; those with ruined roots—therefore it is not discussed as being connected. The remaining six are Mahāyāna gates; if they wish to advance, they can also go—therefore they are connected.
