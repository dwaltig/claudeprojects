## ○四、廣釋境
# The Extensive Interpretation of Realm

---

廣釋境，又為二：一、釋諸境，二、論諸境同異。

> The extensive interpretation of Realm has two parts: (1) Interpreting the [six] realms, (2) Discussing the sameness and difference of the realms.

釋境為六：一、十如境。二、因緣境。三、四諦境。四、二諦境。五、三諦境。六、一諦境。

> **Interpreting the Realm has six [categories]:**
> 1. **Ten Suchnesses Realm** (十如境)
> 2. **Dependent Origination Realm** (因緣境)
> 3. **Four Noble Truths Realm** (四諦境)
> 4. **Two Truths Realm** (二諦境)
> 5. **Three Truths Realm** (三諦境)
> 6. **One Truth Realm** (一諦境)

---

### On the Sequence

然眾經赴緣，明境甚眾，豈可具載？略舉六種。

> The various sūtras respond to conditions, clarifying realms in great number—how could we exhaustively record them? We briefly raise six kinds.

六種次第者，十如是，此經所說，故在初。次十二因緣，三世輪迴，本來具有。如來出世，分別巧示，四諦名興。從廣至略，次辨二諦。二諦語通，別顯中道，次明三諦。三諦猶帶方便，直顯真實，次明一諦。一諦猶有名相，次明無諦。始從無明，終至實際，略用六種足。

> **The sequence of the six:** The Ten Suchnesses are spoken in this sūtra, hence placed first. Next, the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination—cyclic existence through three times, originally complete. The Tathāgata appeared in the world, skillfully distinguishing and revealing [them], and the name "Four Noble Truths" arose. Moving from extensive to concise, we next analyze the Two Truths. The language of Two Truths is comprehensive; to separately reveal the Middle Way, we next clarify the Three Truths. The Three Truths still carry expedients; to directly reveal the Real, we next clarify the One Truth. The One Truth still has name and marks; [beyond this] we clarify No-Truth. Beginning from ignorance, ending at the Real Limit—brief use of six kinds suffices.

---

## 一、明十如境
# 1. The Ten Suchnesses Realm

已如前說(云云)。

> Already explained above.

---

## 二、釋因緣境
# 2. The Dependent Origination Realm

---

又為四：一、正釋。二、判麁妙。三、開麁顯妙。四、觀心。

> This has four parts: (1) Direct interpretation, (2) Judging coarse and subtle, (3) Opening the coarse to reveal the subtle, (4) Mind contemplation.

---

### 正釋 — Direct Interpretation

正釋，又為四：

> The direct interpretation has four [types]:

一、明思議生滅十二因緣。二、明思議不生不滅十二因緣。三、明不思議生滅十二因緣。四、明不思議不生不滅十二因緣。

> 1. **Conceivable Arising-and-Ceasing** Twelve Links
> 2. **Conceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing** Twelve Links
> 3. **Inconceivable Arising-and-Ceasing** Twelve Links
> 4. **Inconceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing** Twelve Links

---

#### Type 1: Conceivable Arising-and-Ceasing (思議生滅)

思議兩種因緣，為利、鈍兩緣，辨界內法論也。《中》(論云)：「為鈍根弟子說十二因緣生滅相。」

> The two conceivable types of dependent origination are for sharp and dull capacities, discussing dharmas within the [three] realms. The *Madhyamaka-śāstra* says: "For dull-rooted disciples, [we] teach the arising-and-ceasing marks of the twelve links."

此簡異外道；外道邪謂諸法從自在天生，或言世性，或言微塵，或言父母，或言無因，種種邪推，不當道理。

> This distinguishes [Buddhism] from non-Buddhists. Non-Buddhists wrongly claim that dharmas arise from Īśvara, or from world-nature, or from atoms, or from parents, or from no cause—various wrong inferences that do not accord with reason.

---

##### The Painter Simile

此正因緣不同邪計，唯是過去無明顛倒心中造作諸行，能出今世六道苦果，好惡不同。

> This correct dependent origination differs from wrong views. It is only that past ignorance, in the confused mind, creates various actions, producing the present-life suffering-fruit of the six destinies, good and bad differing.

《正法念》云：「畫人分布五彩，圖一切形，端正醜陋，不可稱計。」原其根本，從畫手出，六道差別，非自在等作，悉從一念無明心出。

> The *Saddharmasmṛtyupasthāna* says: "A painter distributes five colors, drawing all forms—beautiful and ugly beyond measure." Tracing to the root, they come from the painter's hand. **The differentiation of the six destinies is not made by Īśvara and such; all comes from the one-thought of the ignorant mind.**[^1]

無明與上品惡行業合，即起地獄因緣，如畫出黑色。無明與中品惡行業合，起畜生道因緣，如畫出赤色。無明與下品惡行合，起鬼道因緣，如畫青色。無明與下品善行合，即起修羅因緣，如畫黃色。無明與中品善行合，即起人因緣，如畫白色。無明與上品善行合，即起天因緣，如畫上上白色。

> | Grade of Action | Destiny | Color |
> |-----------------|---------|-------|
> | **Upper evil** | Hell | Black |
> | **Middle evil** | Animal | Red |
> | **Lower evil** | Hungry ghost | Blue |
> | **Lower good** | Asura | Yellow |
> | **Middle good** | Human | White |
> | **Upper good** | Deva | Purest white |

當知無明與諸行合故，即有六道，名色、六入、觸、受、愛、取、有、生、老、病、死等，隨上中下，差別不同。

> Know that because ignorance combines with actions, there are the six destinies—name-and-form, six sense-bases, contact, feeling, craving, grasping, becoming, birth, old age, sickness, death, etc.—following upper, middle, and lower, differing in distinction.

---

##### The Wheel of Existence

人天諸趣，苦樂萬品，以生歸死，死已還生，三世盤迴，車輪旋火。

> Human and heavenly destinies, myriad kinds of suffering and happiness, from birth returning to death, after death being reborn again—**cycling through three times like a spinning wheel of fire**.

故《經》言：「有河洄澓沒眾生，無明所盲不能出。」經又稱為十二牽連更相拘帶，亦名十二重城，亦名十二棘園。

> Therefore the sūtra says: "There is a river with whirlpools drowning sentient beings; blinded by ignorance, they cannot escape." The sūtra also calls it "twelve mutually pulling and binding" (十二牽連), also "twelve-layered city" (十二重城), also "twelve-thorn garden" (十二棘園).

此十二因緣，新新生滅，念念不住，故名生滅十二因緣也。

> These twelve links, ever-newly arising and ceasing, not abiding for a single thought-moment—hence called the **Arising-and-Ceasing Twelve Links**.

---

#### Type 2: Conceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing (思議不生不滅)

二、思議不生不滅十二者，此以巧破拙。《中論》云：「為利根弟子說十二不生不滅。」

> Second, Conceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing Twelve Links: this uses the skillful to break the clumsy. The *Madhyamaka-śāstra* says: "For sharp-rooted disciples, [we] teach the twelve as non-arising-non-ceasing."

癡如虛空，乃至老死如虛空：無明如幻化，不可得故，乃至老死如幻化，不可得。

> **Delusion is like empty space**, up to old-age-and-death being like empty space. Ignorance is like illusion—unobtainable; up to old-age-and-death being like illusion—unobtainable.

《金光明》云：「無明體相，本自不有，妄想因緣，和合而有。」

> The *Suvarṇaprabhāsa* says: "The nature and marks of ignorance originally do not exist; due to false thinking and conditions, they combine to appear."

不善思惟心行所造，如幻師在四衢道，幻作種種象、馬、纓珞、人物等，癡謂真實、智知非真。無明幻出六道依正，當知本自不有，無明所為。如知藤本非蛇，則怖心不生，不生故不滅。是名思議不生不滅十二因緣相也。

> Created by unwholesome mental fabrication, like a magician at a crossroads conjuring various elephants, horses, ornaments, and people—the foolish consider them real; the wise know they are not real. **Ignorance conjures the six destinies' dependent and proper [retributions]**—know that they originally do not exist; ignorance creates them. It is like knowing that a vine is not a snake—then the fearful mind does not arise; not arising, it does not cease. **This is the Conceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing Twelve Links.**

---

#### Type 3: Inconceivable Arising-and-Ceasing (不思議生滅)

三、不思議生滅因緣者，破小明大，為利鈍兩緣說界外法也。

> Third, Inconceivable Arising-and-Ceasing: breaking the small to clarify the great, teaching dharmas beyond the [three] realms for both sharp and dull capacities.

《華嚴》云：「心如工畫師，作種種五陰。一切世間中，莫不從心造。」畫師，即無明心也。一切世間，即是十法界假實國土等也。

> The *Avataṃsaka* says: "**The mind is like a skilled painter, creating various five aggregates. In all the world, nothing is not made by mind.**" The painter is the ignorant mind. All worlds means the ten Dharma-Realms' provisional and real lands, etc.

---

##### Beyond-Realm Dependent Origination

出界外十二因緣者，如《寶性論》云：「羅漢、支佛空智，於如來身本所不見。」

> The **beyond-realm twelve links**: as the *Ratnagotravibhāga* says: "The emptiness-wisdom of Arhats and Pratyekabuddhas fundamentally does not see the Tathāgata's body."

二乘雖有無常等四對治，依如來法身，復是顛倒，顛倒故即是無明。

> Although the Two Vehicles have the four antidotes of impermanence, etc., in dependence on the Tathāgata's Dharma-body, [their view] is again confused—**because of confusion, it is ignorance**.

住無漏界中有四種障，謂緣、相、生、壞。

> **Within the outflow-free realm, there are four kinds of obstruction**: condition (緣), mark (相), birth (生), decay (壞).

緣者，謂無明住地，與行作緣也。相者，無明共行為因也。生者，謂無明住地，共無漏業因，生三種意生身也。壞者，三種意生身，緣不可思議變易死也。

> - **Condition**: The ground-of-ignorance conditions action.
> - **Mark**: Ignorance together with action becomes cause.
> - **Birth**: The ground-of-ignorance, together with outflow-free karmic cause, gives birth to the **three kinds of mind-made bodies**.
> - **Decay**: The three mind-made bodies condition **inconceivable transformation-death** (變易死).[^2]

還如界內十二因緣，從無明至老死也。

> This is still like the within-realm twelve links, from ignorance to old-age-and-death.

---

##### The Four Imperfections

彼論云：「三種意生身，未得離無明垢，未得究竟無為淨；無明、細戲論未永滅，未得究竟無為我；無明、細戲論集，因無漏業生意陰未永滅，未得無為樂；煩惱染、業染、生染未究竟滅，未證甘露究竟常。」

> That treatise says: "The three mind-made bodies have not yet separated from the defilement of ignorance—not yet attaining ultimate unconditioned **purity**. The subtle conceptual proliferations of ignorance are not yet permanently extinguished—not yet attaining ultimate unconditioned **self**. The accumulation of subtle conceptual proliferations, mental aggregates born from outflow-free karma, are not yet permanently extinguished—not yet attaining unconditioned **bliss**. The defilements of affliction, karma, and birth are not yet ultimately extinguished—not yet realizing the ultimate **permanence** of sweet-dew."

| Obstruction | What's Missing | Pāramitā |
|-------------|----------------|----------|
| Condition (無明) | Great Purity | 淨 |
| Mark (業) | Eight-fold Self-Mastery | 我 |
| Birth (苦) | Great Bliss | 樂 |
| Decay (死) | Unchanging Permanence | 常 |

---

#### Type 4: Inconceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing (不思議不生不滅)

不思議不生不滅十二因緣者，為利根人即事顯理也。

> Fourth, **Inconceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing** Twelve Links: for sharp-rooted people, it manifests principle precisely in phenomena.

《大經》云：「十二因緣名為佛性」者，無明、愛、取既是煩惱，煩惱道即是菩提。菩提通達無復煩惱，煩惱既無，即究竟淨，了因佛性也。

> The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "**The twelve links of dependent origination are called Buddha-nature.**" Ignorance, craving, and grasping are afflictions; the path of affliction is precisely *bodhi*. *Bodhi* penetrates [them] so there is no more affliction; affliction not existing, there is ultimate purity—**the understanding-cause Buddha-nature**.

行、有是業道，即是解脫，解脫自在，緣因佛性也。

> Action and becoming are the path of karma—precisely liberation. Liberation is self-mastery—**the conditioning-cause Buddha-nature**.

名色、老死是苦道，苦即法身。法身無苦、無樂，是名大樂。不生不死是常，正因佛性。

> Name-and-form, old-age-and-death are the path of suffering—suffering is precisely the Dharma-body. The Dharma-body having neither suffering nor [ordinary] happiness is called **Great Bliss**. Neither arising nor ceasing is **permanence**—**the direct-cause Buddha-nature**.

故言無明與愛，是二中間，即是中道。無明是過去，愛是現在，若邊若中無非佛性、並是常樂我淨，無明不生亦復不滅。是名不思議不生不滅十二因緣也。

> Therefore it says: "Between ignorance and craving—this is the Middle Way." Ignorance is past; craving is present. **Whether edge or middle, nothing is not Buddha-nature; all is permanence, bliss, self, and purity.** Ignorance neither arises nor ceases. **This is the Inconceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing Twelve Links.**

## 三、明四諦境
# 3. The Four Noble Truths Realm

---

### The Four Types of Four Noble Truths

四種四諦者：一、生滅。二、無生滅。三、無量。四、無作。其義出《涅槃．聖行品》，約偏、圓、事、理分四種之殊。

> **The Four Types of Four Noble Truths:**
> 1. **Arising-and-Ceasing** (生滅)
> 2. **Non-Arising** (無生滅)
> 3. **Immeasurable** (無量)
> 4. **Without-Action** (無作)

Their meaning comes from the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*, "Sacred Conduct Chapter," distinguished into four kinds according to partial/complete and phenomenal/principle.

---

#### 3.1 Arising-and-Ceasing Four Noble Truths (生滅四諦)

所言生滅者，迷真重故，從事受名。

> What is called "Arising-and-Ceasing": because confusion about truth is heavy, [this teaching] receives its name from phenomena.

《大經》云：「陰入重檐，逼迫繫縛，是苦諦。見愛煩惱，能招來果，是集諦。戒、定、慧、無常、苦、空，能除苦本，是道諦。二十五有子、果縛斷，是滅諦。」

> The *Mahāyāna Parinirvāṇa* says: "The aggregates and sense-fields, layered burdens, oppressing and binding—this is **Suffering**. Views and craving, afflictions that can bring future fruit—this is **Accumulation**. Discipline, concentration, wisdom, impermanence, suffering, emptiness, able to remove the root of suffering—this is the **Path**. The offspring-bondage and fruit-bondage of the twenty-five existences cut off—this is **Cessation**."

---

#### 3.2 Non-Arising Four Noble Truths (無生四諦)

無生者，迷真輕故，從理得名。苦，無逼迫相；集，無和合相；道，不二相；滅，無生相。

> "Non-Arising": because confusion about truth is light, [this teaching] receives its name from principle. **Suffering has no mark of oppression; Accumulation has no mark of combination; the Path has no mark of duality; Cessation has no mark of arising.**

《大經》云：「諸菩薩等解苦無苦，是故無苦而有真諦。」三亦如是。

> The *Mahāyāna Parinirvāṇa* says: "Bodhisattvas understand suffering as non-suffering; therefore there is no suffering yet there is true principle." The [other] three are also thus.

---

#### 3.3 Immeasurable Four Noble Truths (無量四諦)

無量者，迷中重故，從事得名。苦有無量相，十法界果不同故。集有無量相，五住煩惱不同故。道有無量相，恒沙佛法不同故。滅有無量相，諸波羅蜜不同故。

> "Immeasurable": because confusion within [the middle way] is heavy, [this teaching] receives its name from phenomena. **Suffering has immeasurable marks because the fruits of the ten Dharma-Realms differ. Accumulation has immeasurable marks because the five-dwelling afflictions differ. The Path has immeasurable marks because Buddha-dharmas [numerous as] Ganges sands differ. Cessation has immeasurable marks because the *pāramitās* differ.**

《大經》云：「知諸陰苦，名為中智。分別諸陰，有無量相，非諸聲聞、緣覺所知。我於彼經，竟不說之。」

> The *Mahāyāna Parinirvāṇa* says: "To know the suffering of the aggregates is called middle wisdom. To distinguish that the aggregates have immeasurable marks—this is not known by Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas. In those sūtras, I never spoke of it."

---

#### 3.4 Without-Action Four Noble Truths (無作四諦)

無作者，迷中輕故，從理得名。以迷理故，菩提是煩惱，名集諦。涅槃是生死，名苦諦。以能解故，煩惱即菩提，名道諦。生死即涅槃，名滅諦。

> "Without-Action": because confusion within [the middle way] is light, [this teaching] receives its name from principle. **Due to confusion about principle, *bodhi* is affliction—called Accumulation. *Nirvāṇa* is birth-and-death—called Suffering. Due to understanding, affliction is precisely *bodhi*—called the Path. Birth-and-death is precisely *nirvāṇa*—called Cessation.**

即事而中，無思無念，無誰造作，故名無作。

> Precisely phenomena are the Middle; no thought, no conception, no one creating—hence called "Without-Action."

《大經》云：「世諦即是第一義諦。有善方便，隨順眾生，說有二諦。出世人知即第一義諦。」

> The *Mahāyāna Parinirvāṇa* says: "Conventional truth is precisely ultimate truth. Through skillful means, following sentient beings, we speak of two truths. Those who transcend the world know it is precisely ultimate truth."

---

### Summary Table: Four Types of Four Noble Truths

| Type | Teaching | Suffering | Accumulation | Path | Cessation |
|------|----------|-----------|--------------|------|-----------|
| **Arising-Ceasing** | Tripiṭaka | Oppression | Afflictions bringing fruit | Discipline, wisdom | Bondage cut |
| **Non-Arising** | Common | No oppression mark | No combination mark | Non-duality | No arising mark |
| **Immeasurable** | Distinct | Infinite per 10 realms | Five-dwelling afflictions | Ganges sands of dharmas | Various *pāramitās* |
| **Without-Action** | Perfect | Birth-death = Nirvāṇa | *Bodhi* = Affliction | Affliction = *Bodhi* | No one creating |

---

## 四、明二諦境
# 4. The Two Truths Realm

---

### The Difficulty of Understanding Two Truths

夫二諦者，名出眾經，而其理難曉，世間紛紜，由來碩諍。

> The Two Truths—their name appears in many sūtras, but their principle is difficult to understand. The world is confused; there have long been great disputes.

《妙勝定經》云：「佛昔與文殊，共諍二諦，俱墮地獄。至迦葉佛時，共質所疑。」二聖因地尚不能了，況即人情強生去取？

> The *Subtle Victory Samādhi Sūtra* says: "The Buddha and Mañjuśrī once debated the Two Truths and both fell into hell. At the time of Kāśyapa Buddha, they together resolved their doubts." If even two sages in their causal stage could not understand, how much more [difficult for] ordinary human sentiment forcibly selecting [views]!

---

### Three Ways of Speaking Two Truths

今謂不爾。夫經論異說，悉是如來善權方便，知根知欲，種種不同，略有三異，謂隨情、情智、智等。

> We now say it is not so. The various explanations in sūtras and treatises are all the Tathāgata's skillful expedient means, knowing roots and desires, with various differences. Briefly, there are **three different [approaches]**: following feeling (隨情), feeling-and-wisdom (情智), and following wisdom (智).[^3]

---

### The Seven Types of Two Truths

所言七種二諦者：

> **The Seven Types of Two Truths:**

| # | Conventional (俗) | Ultimate (真) | Teaching |
|---|-------------------|---------------|----------|
| 1 | Real existence | Real extinction | Tripiṭaka |
| 2 | Illusory existence | Illusory-existence-is-empty | Common |
| 3 | Illusory existence | Empty-and-not-empty combined | Distinct (entry) |
| 4 | Illusory existence | All dharmas converge on empty-not-empty | Distinct (full) |
| 5 | Illusory + Illusory-empty = Conventional | Not-existent-not-empty | Perfect (entry) |
| 6 | Illusory + Illusory-empty = Conventional | All converge on not-existent-not-empty | Perfect (approaching) |
| 7 | Illusory + Illusory-empty = Conventional | All converge on existent/empty/neither | Perfect (complete) |

---

#### Type 1: Real Existence Two Truths (實有二諦)

實有二諦者，陰、入、界等皆是實法。實法所成，森羅萬品，故名為俗。方便修道，滅此俗已，乃得會真。

> **Real Existence Two Truths**: The aggregates, sense-bases, and elements are all real dharmas. What real dharmas constitute, the myriad forms of the world, is called conventional. Through expedient path-cultivation, having extinguished this conventional, one can then realize truth.

《大品》云：「空色、色空」，以滅俗故謂為「空色」；不滅色故謂為「色空」。

> The *Prajñāpāramitā* says: "Emptying form, form is empty." Because conventional is extinguished, it is called "emptying form"; not extinguishing form, it is called "form is empty."

病中無藥，文字中無菩提，皆是此意。

> "Within sickness there is no medicine; within written words there is no *bodhi*"—all are this meaning.

---

#### Type 2: Illusory Existence Two Truths (幻有空二諦)

幻有空二諦者，斥前意也。何者？實有時無真，滅有時無俗，二諦義不成。

> **Illusory Existence Two Truths** refutes the former meaning. Why? When [dharmas] really exist, there is no truth; when existence is extinguished, there is no conventional. The meaning of Two Truths is not established.

若明幻有者，幻有是俗，幻有不可得，即俗而真。《大品》云：「即色是空，即空是色。」空色相即，二諦義成。

> If one clarifies illusory existence: illusory existence is conventional; illusory existence being unobtainable—precisely conventional is truth. The *Prajñāpāramitā* says: "**Precisely form is emptiness, precisely emptiness is form.**" Emptiness and form being mutually identical, the meaning of Two Truths is established.

---

#### Type 7: Perfect Teaching Two Truths (圓教二諦)

圓教二諦者，直說不思議二諦也。真即是俗；俗即是真。如如意珠，珠以譬真，用以譬俗。即珠是用，即用是珠，不二而二，分真俗耳。

> **Perfect Teaching Two Truths** directly teach the inconceivable Two Truths. **Truth is precisely conventional; conventional is precisely truth.** It is like a wish-fulfilling jewel: the jewel likens truth; its function likens conventional. **Precisely the jewel is the function; precisely the function is the jewel—not two yet two, distinguishing truth and conventional.**

身子云：「佛以種種緣，譬喻巧言說。其心安如海，我聞疑網斷。」即其義焉。

> Śāriputra said: "The Buddha through various conditions, similes, and skillful words—his mind peaceful as the ocean—I heard and my net of doubt was cut." This is that meaning.

---

## Footnotes

[^1]: This famous simile appears in the *Avataṃsaka Sūtra* and becomes central to Tiantai's understanding of mind-only causality: "The mind is like a skilled painter, creating the five aggregates." Unlike Yogācāra's emphasis on *ālaya-vijñāna*, Tiantai emphasizes the **one-thought of ignorance** (一念無明) as the source.

[^2]: **Transformation-death** (變易死) is the subtle death experienced by Arhats, Pratyekabuddhas, and great Bodhisattvas in the pure lands. Unlike the coarse birth-and-death of ordinary beings (分段生死), this is the refined death of those who have transcended the three realms but not yet attained complete Buddhahood.

[^3]: **Three approaches to Two Truths teaching:**
- **隨情** (Following Feeling): Teaching adapted to the listener's current disposition, which may vary greatly
- **情智** (Feeling-and-Wisdom): The listener perceives conventionally but understands truly
- **隨智** (Following Wisdom): The sage perceives both conventional and ultimate with liberated wisdom
