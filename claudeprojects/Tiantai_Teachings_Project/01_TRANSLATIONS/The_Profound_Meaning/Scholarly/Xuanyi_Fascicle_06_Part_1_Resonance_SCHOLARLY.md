○第六明感應妙者，上來四妙名為圓因，三法祕藏名為圓果：境妙究竟顯，名毘盧遮那；智妙究竟滿，名盧舍那；行妙究竟滿，名釋迦牟尼。三佛不一異、不縱橫，故名妙果。《釋論》云：「稽首智度無子佛」者，果地圓極非復因位，故稱無子。果智寂照，有感必彰，故明感應妙也。即為六：一、釋感應名。二、明相。三、明同異。四、明相對。五、明麁妙。六、明觀心。

> The sixth, clarifying the Subtlety of Stimulus and Response: the previous four subtleties are named the Perfect Cause, the secret treasury of the three dharmas is named the Perfect Fruit: when realm‑subtlety is ultimately manifest, it is named Vairocana; when wisdom‑subtlety is ultimately fulfilled, it is named Rocana; when practice‑subtlety is ultimately fulfilled, it is named Śākyamuni. The three Buddhas are neither one nor different, neither vertical nor horizontal, therefore they are named the subtle fruit. The *Śāstra* says: “I bow to the Buddha of Wisdom‑Perfection without offspring”; the fruit‑ground is perfectly ultimate and no longer the causal stage, therefore it is called without offspring. Fruit‑wisdom is quiescent and illuminating; when there is a stimulus it must manifest, therefore we clarify the Subtlety of Stimulus and Response. It is six: (1) explaining the name of stimulus and response; (2) clarifying the marks; (3) clarifying sameness and difference; (4) clarifying correspondence; (5) clarifying coarse and subtle; (6) clarifying contemplation of mind.

釋名又三：一、釋名。二、四悉檀帖解。三、料簡。釋名者，《正法華》云：「無數世界廣說經法」，世尊所為感應如是，今故用為名。而經中機語、緣語，並是感之異目，悉語眾生，且從機釋義則易見，緣感例可解。

> Explaining the name is again three: (1) explaining the name; (2) applying the four siddhāntas to explain; (3) discrimination. Explaining the name: the *Zhengfa Hua* says: “In innumerable worlds it broadly expounds the Dharma of the sūtra”; the World‑Honored One’s acts of stimulus and response are thus, therefore we now use it as the name. And within the sūtra, “machine‑phrases” and “condition‑phrases” are both alternate names of stimulus, all speaking of sentient beings; for now, explaining the meaning from machine is easy to see, and the case of conditions and stimulus can be understood by analogy.

機有三義：一者、機是微義。故《易》云：「機者，動之微，吉之先現。」又《阿含》云：「眾生有善法之機，聖人來應也。」眾生有將生之善，此善微微將動，而得為機。若將生善為機，此結為促；今明可生之善，此語則寬。如弩有可發之機，故射者發之，發之則箭動，不發則不前；眾生有可生之善，故聖應則善生，不應則不生。故言機者微也。二者、《古注楞伽經》云：「機是關義。」何者？眾生有善有惡，關聖慈悲，故機是關義也。三者、機是宜義。如欲拔無明之苦，正宜於悲；欲與法性之樂，正宜於慈，故機是宜義也。

> Machine has three meanings: first, machine means subtlety. Therefore the *Yijing* says: “The machine is the subtlety of movement, the first manifestation of fortune.” Also the *Āgama* says: “Sentient beings have the machine of wholesome dharmas; the sage comes to respond.” Sentient beings have good about to arise; this good subtly begins to move and thus becomes machine. If one takes about‑to‑arise good as machine, this explanation becomes tight; now clarifying good that can arise, this wording is broad. Like a crossbow has a triggerable mechanism, therefore the archer triggers it; triggered, the arrow moves; not triggered, it does not go forward. Sentient beings have good that can arise, therefore when the sage responds, good arises; without response, it does not arise. Therefore “machine” means subtle. Second, the *Ancient Commentary on the Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra* says: “Machine means hinge.” What is this? Sentient beings have good and evil that hinge upon the sage’s compassion, therefore machine is hinge. Third, machine means suitability. If one wishes to pull out the suffering of ignorance, it is precisely suitable to compassion; if one wishes to give the joy of dharma‑nature, it is precisely suitable to loving‑kindness; therefore machine is suitability.

次明應者，亦為三義：一者、應是赴義。既言機有可生之理，機微將動，聖人赴之，其善得生，故用赴而釋應。二者、應是對義。如人交關，更相主對，若一欲賣，一不欲買，則不相主對；若賣買兩和，則貿易交決，貴賤無悔。今以眾生譬買，如來譬賣，就機以論關，就應以論對，故以對釋應也。三者、應是應義。既言機是於宜，宜何等法？應以慈悲之法，是善惡所宜。悲則宜救苦，慈則宜與樂。隨以何法，應其所宜，故以應釋應也。

> Next, explaining response also has three meanings: first, response means going‑to. Since it is said that the machine has a principle of what can arise, when the machine subtly stirs, the sage goes to it and its good is able to arise, therefore response is explained as going‑to. Second, response means matching. Like people making transactions, mutually facing one another: if one wants to sell and the other does not want to buy, then they do not face one another; if seller and buyer are in harmony, the trade is completed and value is agreed without regret. Now taking sentient beings as buyer and the Tathāgata as seller, regarding machine we discuss the hinge, regarding response we discuss the match, therefore response is explained as matching. Third, response means responding. Since machine is suitability, suitable for what dharma? One should respond with the dharma of compassion, which suits good and evil. Compassion is suited to rescuing suffering, loving‑kindness is suited to giving joy. Responding with whatever dharma suits, therefore response is explained as response.

二、明四悉檀帖釋者，機應各有三義，即四悉檀意也。若微以釋機，赴以釋應者，是赴樂欲之心也。何但心善可生名之為欲，如草木無心，亦稱可生、欲生、將生，故知赴此善生，是隨樂欲，即世界悉檀明機應也。若關以釋機，對以釋應，更相對當。以悲對其苦機、以慈對其善機者，即是隨對治悉檀以明機應也。次以宜釋機，以應釋應者，即是為人、第一義也。宜以如此等法，與其機感相宜，宜生事善，即為人悉檀；宜生理善，即是第一義悉檀也。

> Second, clarifying the four siddhāntas by applied explanation: machine and response each have three meanings, which are precisely the intent of the four siddhāntas. If subtle is used to explain machine and going‑to to explain response, this is going to the mind that desires joy. It is not only that a mind good can arise is called desire; like grasses and trees without mind are also called able‑to‑arise, desiring to arise, about‑to‑arise—therefore we know that going to this arising good is following the desire for joy, that is, the world‑siddhānta clarifying machine and response. If hinge is used to explain machine and matching to explain response, they correspond to each other. Using compassion to match its suffering machine and loving‑kindness to match its good machine is precisely the antidote‑siddhānta clarifying machine and response. Next, using suitability to explain machine and response to explain response is precisely the person‑siddhānta and the supreme‑meaning. Suiting with such dharmas so that they accord with its machine‑stimulus: if it is suited to produce good in phenomena, that is the person‑siddhānta; if it is suited to produce good in principle, that is the supreme‑meaning siddhānta.

三、料簡者。

> Third, discrimination.

問：

> Question:

何意於理善稱第一義悉檀耶？

> Why is the good in principle called the supreme‑meaning siddhānta?

答：

> Answer:

理善明生，理闇必滅，終不理惡滅，方始理善生，故於理善稱第一義悉檀也。若事善生，事惡未必去；事惡去，事善未必生。事是隔別，對治悉檀正是藥病相對，故不於中開第一義悉檀，其意在此。

> The good in principle clearly arises, the darkness in principle necessarily ceases; it is never that principle‑evil ceases and only then principle‑good arises. Therefore the good in principle is called the supreme‑meaning siddhānta. If good in phenomena arises, evil in phenomena does not necessarily go; if evil in phenomena goes, good in phenomena does not necessarily arise. Phenomena are separated; the antidote‑siddhānta is precisely the matching of medicine and illness, therefore one does not open the supreme‑meaning siddhānta within it—this is the intent.

問：

> Question:

眾生機，聖人應，為一為異？若一則非機應，若異，何相交關而論機應？

> Sentient beings are the machine, sages respond—are they one or different? If one, then it is not machine and response; if different, how do they intersect and speak of machine and response?

答：

> Answer:

不一不異。理論則同如，是故不異；事論有機應，是故不一。譬如父子天性相關，骨肉遺體，異則不可；若同者，父即子，子即父，同又不可；秖不一不異而論父子也。眾生理性與佛不殊，是故不異；而眾生隱如來顯，是故不一，不一不異而論機應也。又同是非事非理故不異，眾生得事，聖人得理；又聖人得事，凡夫有理。故論異(云云)。

> Neither one nor different. In principle, they are the same suchness, therefore not different; in phenomena, there is machine and response, therefore not one. It is like father and son whose natures are connected, whose bones and flesh are inherited; if different, it is impossible; if the same, father is son and son is father—also impossible; one speaks of father and son only as neither one nor different. Sentient beings’ principle‑nature is not different from the Buddha’s, therefore not different; yet sentient beings are hidden and the Tathāgata is manifest, therefore not one—thus one speaks of machine and response as neither one nor different. Also, sameness is not phenomena and not principle, therefore not different; sentient beings attain phenomena, sages attain principle; again sages attain phenomena, ordinary beings have principle. Therefore one discusses difference (and so on).

問：

> Question:

為用法身應？為用應身應？若應身應，應身無本何能應？若用法身應，應則非法。

> Is response made using the Dharma‑body, or using the response‑body? If the response‑body responds, the response‑body has no basis—how can it respond? If the Dharma‑body responds, then the response is not Dharma.

答：

> Answer:

至論諸法非去來今，非應非不應而能有應；亦可言法應，亦可言應應。法應則冥益，應應則顯益。分別冥顯有四義。如後說(云云)。

> When discussing dharmas as not past, present, or future, they are neither response nor non‑response yet can have response. One may also speak of dharma‑response, and also speak of response‑response. Dharma‑response is hidden benefit; response‑response is manifest benefit. Distinguishing hidden and manifest has four meanings, as later said (and so on).

第二明機應相者，約善惡明機相，約慈悲論應相。若善惡為機，為單？為共？解者不同。或言單惡為機，引經云：「我為斷一切眾生瘡疣重病。」又云：「如有七子，然於病者心則偏重，如來亦爾，於諸眾生非不平等，然於罪者心則偏重。」又云：「如來不為無為眾生而住於世。」又無記是無明，終屬惡攝，此即單以惡為機。或單以善為機，引《大經》云：「我觀眾生，不觀老少中年貧富貴賤，有善心者即便慈念。」此則單善為機。或云，善惡不得獨為機。何者？如金剛後心即是佛，眾善普會善無過此，此何得為機耶？雖云佛佛相念，此是通語，而無拔無與，故知單善不得為機。單惡不得為機者，如闡提極惡不能感佛，《大經》云：「唯有一髮不能升身」，即是性德理善。此是通機終不成感也。或取善惡相帶為機者，從闡提起改悔心，上至等覺，皆有善惡相帶，故得為機。是故約此善惡明其相也(云云)。

> Second, clarifying the marks of machine and response: by good and evil one clarifies the marks of machine; by compassion and loving‑kindness one discusses the marks of response. If good and evil are the machine, are they single or shared? Explanations differ. Some say single evil is the machine, citing a sūtra: “I am for cutting off all sentient beings’ sores and grave illnesses.” It also says: “Like having seven children, yet toward the sick one the mind then leans more; the Tathāgata is also thus: among sentient beings he is not unequal, yet toward the guilty ones the mind then leans more.” It also says: “The Tathāgata does not abide in the world for those without activity.” Also, the neutral is ignorance and in the end belongs to the evil category; this is taking evil alone as the machine. Or taking good alone as the machine, citing the *Great Sutra*: “I observe sentient beings, not looking at old, young, middle‑aged, poor, rich, noble, low; those with good hearts I immediately regard with compassion.” This is taking good alone as the machine. Or they say good and evil cannot each alone be the machine. Why? Like the vajra‑after‑thought is precisely Buddhahood; all good converges and no good surpasses this—how could that be machine? Though it says Buddhas recollect Buddhas, this is a general phrase, and there is no pulling out and no giving; therefore we know good alone cannot be the machine. Evil alone cannot be the machine either: an icchantika is extremely evil and cannot move the Buddha; the *Great Sutra* says: “Only a single hair cannot lift the body,” which is the principle‑good of inherent virtue. This is a general machine and in the end does not become response. Or one takes good and evil interlinked as the machine: from an icchantika arousing a repentant mind up to equal awakening, all have good and evil interlinked, therefore they can be the machine. Therefore by good and evil one clarifies its marks (and so on).

次約慈悲以明應相者，或單以慈為應，經云：「慈善根力象見師子，廣說如涅槃(云云)。」或單以悲為應，如《請觀音》，或遊戲地獄大悲代受苦；或合用慈悲為應。何者？良以悲心熏於智慧能拔他苦，慈心熏於禪定能與他樂。下文云：「定慧力莊嚴，以此度眾生。」論云：「水銀和真金，能塗諸色像。」功德和法身，處處應現往，豈是水銀真金單能塗色像耶？當知慈悲合論應也。

> Next, by compassion and loving‑kindness one clarifies the marks of response: some take loving‑kindness alone as response; the sūtra says: “The power of the loving‑kindness good‑roots is like an elephant seeing a lion,” and it is widely explained in the *Nirvāṇa* (and so on). Some take compassion alone as response, as in the *Requesting Avalokiteśvara*, or playing in the hells, great compassion undergoing suffering on behalf [of others]. Or they take combined loving‑kindness and compassion as response. Why? Because compassion‑mind fumigated by wisdom can pull out others’ suffering; loving‑kindness‑mind fumigated by samādhi can give others joy. Below it says: “Adorned by the power of concentration and wisdom, by this it ferries sentient beings.” The *Śāstra* says: “Mercury mixed with true gold can coat all colored images.” Merit mixed with the Dharma‑body responds and appears everywhere—how could mercury and true gold alone coat colored images? One should know that response is discussed as the union of loving‑kindness and compassion.

問：

> Question:

眾生善惡有三世，何世為機？聖法亦有三世，何世為應？過去已謝，現在不住，未來未至，悉不得為機，亦不得為應，云何論機應耶？

> Sentient beings’ good and evil have three times; which time is the machine? The sage‑dharma also has three times; which time is response? The past is already gone, the present does not abide, the future has not yet arrived; all cannot be machines and also cannot be responses—how can one discuss machine and response?

答：

> Answer:

若就至理窮覈三世，皆不可得，故無機亦無應。故經言：「非謂菩提有去、來、今，但以世俗文字數故。」說有三世，以四悉檀力隨順眾生說。或用過去善為機，故言：「我等宿福慶，今得值世尊。」又如五方便人，過去習方便者，發真則易，不習則難，是故以過去善為機。或可以現在善為機，故言：「即生此念時，佛於空中現。」或可以未來善為機，未生善法為令生故，又如無漏無習因而能感佛也，故《大論》云：「譬如蓮華在水，有已生始生未生者，若不得日光，翳死不疑；眾生三世善，若不值佛，無由得成(云云)。」惡亦如是，或以過去之罪，今悉懺悔；現造眾惡，今亦懺悔。未來之罪，斷相續心，遮未來故，名之為救。何者？過去造惡，障現善不得起，為除此惡，是故請佛。又現在果苦報逼迫，眾生而求救護。又未來之惡，與時相值，遮令不起，故通用三世惡為機。應亦如是，或用過去慈悲為應，故云：「我本立誓願，欲令得此法。」或用現在慈悲為應者，一切天人脩羅，皆應至此，為聽法故，未度令度也；又用未來為應者，即是〈壽量〉中，未來世益物也。亦如〈安樂行品〉中云：「我得三菩提時，引之令得，住是法中。」若通論，三世善惡皆為機；別論，但取未來善惡為正機也。何者？過去已謝，現在已定，秖為拔未來惡，生未來善耳。

> If one investigates the three times by ultimate principle, all are unattainable; therefore there is no machine and no response. Therefore the sūtra says: “It is not that bodhi has past, present, or future, but because of the counts of worldly words.” It says there are three times, by the power of the four siddhāntas, conforming to sentient beings’ speech. Or one uses past good as machine, therefore it says: “We had past blessings and fortune, and now are able to meet the World‑Honored One.” And like people of the five expedients: those who practiced expedients in the past can easily arouse the true; those who did not practice find it difficult; therefore one takes past good as the machine. Or one can take present good as the machine, therefore it says: “When this thought is born, the Buddha appears in the sky.” Or one can take future good as the machine: good dharmas not yet born are to be made to arise; also, like the outflow‑free without habituation‑cause can yet move the Buddha; therefore the *Mahāprajñā‑śāstra* says: “For example, a lotus in water has those already born, beginning to be born, and not yet born; if it does not get sunlight, it withers and dies without doubt; the good of sentient beings in the three times, if they do not encounter the Buddha, have no way to be accomplished (and so on).” Evil is also like this: one may repent now of past sins; one may repent now of present evils; future sins, by cutting the continuing mind and blocking the future, are named rescue. Why? Past evil obstructs present good from arising; to remove this evil, therefore one invites the Buddha. And present fruit‑suffering retribution presses, so sentient beings seek rescue. And future evil, when it meets the time, is blocked so it does not arise; therefore one generally uses three‑times evil as the machine. Response is likewise: one may use past compassion as response, therefore it says: “I originally made a vow, wishing to cause [beings] to obtain this dharma.” One may use present compassion as response: all devas, humans, and asuras should come here to hear the Dharma, and those not yet crossed are made to cross. One may use future [compassion] as response, namely in the 〈Lifespan〉 where future‑world beings are benefited. It is also like in the 〈Peaceful Practices Chapter〉: “When I attain bodhi, I will lead them to attain it and abide in this Dharma.” If one speaks generally, three‑times good and evil are all machines; if one speaks specifically, one only takes future good and evil as the primary machine. Why? The past is already gone, the present is already fixed; it is only to pull out future evil and generate future good.

問：

> Question:

若未來為正機者，四正勤意云何？

> If the future is the primary machine, what is the intent of the four right efforts?

答：

> Answer:

此已屬通意！今更別答者，秖為過去惡遮未來善，故勤斷過去惡；秖為過去善不增長，增長者即是未來善也。是故四正勤中，言雖過去，意實未來(云云)。

> This already belongs to the general intent. Now answering separately: it is only because past evil blocks future good that one diligently cuts past evil; it is only because past good does not increase that one increases it—what increases is precisely future good. Therefore within the four right efforts, though the words are past, the intent is actually future (and so on).

問：

> Question:

未來未有，佛云何照？

> The future does not yet exist—how can the Buddha illuminate it?

答：

> Answer:

如來智鑒，能如是知，非下地所知。仰信而已，何可分別！

> The Tathāgata’s wisdom‑insight can know thus; it is not known by those of lower stages. One only looks up in faith—how could one discriminate!

問：

> Question:

為是眾生自能感？由佛故感？如來自能應？由眾生故應？

> Is it that sentient beings can themselves stimulate? or because of the Buddha they stimulate? Can the Tathāgata respond by himself? or because of sentient beings does he respond?

答：

> Answer:

此應作四句：自、他、共、無因，破是性義悉不可。無此四句故，則無性。無性故，但以世間名字，四悉檀中而論感應能所等。而能應屬佛，所應屬眾生；能感屬眾生，所感屬佛。若更翻疊作諸語言，世諦名字則亂，不可分別。雖作如此名字，是字不住，是字無所有故，如夢如幻(云云)。

> This should be made into four sentences: self, other, both, no cause; to break these, the meaning of nature is all impossible. Without these four sentences, then there is no nature. Because there is no nature, one only uses worldly names, within the four siddhāntas discussing stimulus‑response, agent and object, and the like. The responding‑able belongs to the Buddha; the responded‑to belongs to sentient beings; the stimulating‑able belongs to sentient beings; the stimulated‑to belongs to the Buddha. If one further flips and layers to make various words, worldly‑truth names become chaotic and cannot be discriminated. Though one makes such names, the word does not abide; the word has no real existence—therefore it is like a dream, like an illusion (and so on).

問：

> Question:

既善惡俱為機者，誰無善惡？此皆應得益耶？

> Since good and evil both are machines, who lacks good and evil? Do all gain benefit?

答：

> Answer:

如世病者延醫，而有差不差。機亦如是，有熟不熟，則應有遠有近。

> Like in the world the sick call a physician, and there are those who recover and those who do not; machine is also like this—some are ripe, some are not, so responses are far and near.

三、明機感不同者，即為三意：一、就四句論不同。二、就三十六句論不同。三、就十法界論不同。但眾生根性百千，諸佛巧應無量，隨其種種得度不同，故文云：「名色各異，種類若干，如上中下根莖葉等，隨其種性，各得生長。」即是機、應不同意也。

> Third, clarifying differences in stimulus and response is precisely three intentions: first, discussing differences by the four sentences; second, discussing differences by the thirty‑six sentences; third, discussing differences by the ten dharma realms. But sentient beings’ roots and natures are hundreds and thousands, and Buddhas skillfully respond in immeasurable ways; following their various kinds they are liberated differently. Therefore the text says: “Names and forms are each different, the kinds are many; like upper, middle, and lower roots, stems, and leaves, following their natures, each obtains growth.” This is the meaning of differing machines and responses.

今略言為四：一者、冥機冥應。二者、冥機顯應。三者、顯機顯應。四者、顯機冥應。其相云何？若過去善修三業，現在未運身口，藉往善力名此為冥機也。雖不現見靈應，而密為法身所益。不見不聞而覺而知，是名為冥益也。二冥機顯益者，過去殖善而冥機已成，便得值佛聞法，現前獲利是為顯益。如佛初出世，最初得度之人，現在何甞修行？諸佛照其宿機，自往度之，即其義也。三、顯機顯應者，現在身口，精勤不懈，而能感降。如須達長跪，佛往祇洹，月蓋曲躬，聖居門閫。如即行人，道場禮懺，能感靈瑞，即是顯機顯應也。四者、顯機冥應者，如人雖一世勤苦，現善濃積而不顯感，冥有其利，此是顯機冥益。

> Now briefly speaking, there are four: (1) hidden machine, hidden response; (2) hidden machine, manifest response; (3) manifest machine, manifest response; (4) manifest machine, hidden response. What are their marks? If in the past one cultivated the three karmas in good, and in the present body and speech have not yet been activated, relying on past good power, this is named hidden machine. Though one does not visibly see spiritual response, one is secretly benefited by the Dharma‑body. Not seeing and not hearing yet awakening and knowing is named hidden benefit. Second, hidden‑machine manifest‑benefit: past planting of good and the hidden machine already completed, then one meets the Buddha and hears the Dharma, gaining benefit before one’s eyes—this is manifest benefit. Like the first people liberated when the Buddha first appeared in the world—what present practice did they ever do? The Buddhas illuminate their past machine and go to liberate them; this is its meaning. Third, manifest‑machine manifest‑response: in the present, body and speech are diligent and not lax, and thus can evoke a descent; like Sudatta long kneeling, the Buddha went to Jetavana; like Candrachatra bending, the sage dwelled at the doorway. Like practitioners in the hall, repenting and bowing, able to evoke auspicious responses—this is manifest machine, manifest response. Fourth, manifest‑machine hidden‑response: like a person who, though toiling hard a whole life, has present good thickly accumulated yet no manifest response—there is hidden benefit; this is manifest machine, hidden benefit.

若解四意，一切低頭舉手，福不虛棄，終日無感，終日無悔。若見喜殺壽長，好施貧乏，不生邪見；若不解此者，謂其徒功喪計，憂悔失理。《釋論》云：「今我疾苦，皆由過去；今生修福，報在將來，正念無僻。」得此四意也。

> If one understands the four meanings, every bow of the head and lifting of the hand—merit is not vainly discarded; though all day there is no response, all day there is no regret. If one sees those who delight in killing yet have long life, those who love giving yet are poor, one does not generate wrong views. If one does not understand this, one thinks one’s efforts are wasted and calculations lost, and regrets losing the principle. The *Śāstra* says: “My present illness and suffering all come from the past; in this life I cultivate merit, the recompense is in the future; right mindfulness has no bias.” One gains these four meanings.

二、就三十六句論機應不同者，前冥顯互論略舉四句。若具足辨者，用四機為根本，所謂冥機、顯機、亦冥亦顯機、非冥非顯機。冥是過去，顯是現在，冥顯是過現，非冥非顯是未來。如佛為闡提說法(云云)。於一句中，復為四句：所謂冥機冥應、冥機顯應、冥機亦冥亦顯應、冥機非冥非顯應；餘三機亦如是，四四即成十六句。機既召應，應亦有十六句。一機而感四應，一應而赴四機，機應各為十六，合成三十二句。就前根本四句，便是三十六句機應也。

> Second, discussing differences of machine and response by the thirty‑six sentences: the previous mutual discussion of hidden and manifest briefly raised four sentences. If one differentiates fully, one uses four machines as the root: hidden machine, manifest machine, both hidden and manifest machine, neither hidden nor manifest machine. Hidden is the past, manifest is the present, hidden‑manifest is past and present, neither hidden nor manifest is the future. Like the Buddha preaching to the icchantika (and so on). Within one sentence, again there are four sentences: hidden‑machine hidden‑response, hidden‑machine manifest‑response, hidden‑machine both hidden and manifest response, hidden‑machine neither hidden nor manifest response; the other three machines are likewise. Four times four makes sixteen sentences. The machine summons response, and response also has sixteen sentences. One machine stimulates four responses; one response goes to four machines; machines and responses each are sixteen, together making thirty‑two sentences. Taking the four root sentences above, this becomes the thirty‑six sentences of machine and response.

三、就十法界論機應不同者，秖約一人身業機具三十六，約三業即有一百八機。約三世、三業，則有三百二十四。一界既爾，十法界即有三千二百四十機應不同。就自行既爾，化他亦然，合則六千四百八十機應，此就歷別十法界。如此，若就十法界交互則增九倍，都六萬四千八百機應也。

> Third, discussing differences of machine and response by the ten dharma realms: just regarding one person’s body‑karma, the machine includes thirty‑six; regarding the three karmas, there are one hundred eight machines. Regarding the three times and three karmas, there are three hundred twenty‑four. If one realm is thus, then the ten dharma realms have three thousand two hundred forty machines and responses differing. In self‑practice it is thus; transforming others is also thus; together it is six thousand four hundred eighty machines and responses—this is by the distinct ten dharma realms. If the ten dharma realms mutually interact, it increases ninefold, totaling sixty‑four thousand eight hundred machines and responses.

四、明機應相對者，即有四意：一、明諸有苦樂與三昧慈悲相對。二者、機關等相對。三者、三十六句相對。四者、別圓相對。

> Fourth, clarifying correspondence of machine and response has four intentions: (1) clarifying that the sufferings and joys of the various existences correspond to samādhi compassion; (2) correspondence of the machine‑hinge and the like; (3) correspondence of the thirty‑six sentences; (4) correspondence of distinct and perfect.

諸三昧相對者，諸機乃多不出二十五有；諸應乃多不出二十五三昧。

> As for correspondence of samādhis: the machines in the various existences do not mostly exceed the twenty‑five existences; the responses do not mostly exceed the twenty‑five samādhis.

地獄有，有善惡之機，關無垢三昧慈悲之應。論其惡者，即有黑業、惡見、思惡、塵沙惡、無明惡；論善，則有白業善，即空善、即假善、即中善，是名地獄機也。無垢三昧慈悲為應者，初修無垢三昧，觀地獄界。因緣觀慈悲，即空觀慈悲，即假觀慈悲，即中觀慈悲。以因緣觀時，悲拔地獄黑業苦。以因緣觀時，慈與白業樂。以即空觀時，悲拔見思苦；以即空觀時，慈與無漏樂。以即假觀時，悲拔塵沙苦；以即假觀時，慈與道種智樂。以即中觀時，悲拔無明苦；以即中觀時，慈與法性樂。是為地獄有善、惡之機，以關無垢三昧慈悲之應。拔苦與樂，相對義也。

> Within the hells there are machines of good and evil that hinge upon the compassion of the stainless samādhi response. Regarding its evil, there are black karma, evil views, thought‑evil, dust‑and‑sand evil, ignorance‑evil; regarding its good, there is white‑karma good, namely emptiness‑good, provisional‑good, middle‑good; this is called the hell‑machine. The stainless samādhi compassion as response: first cultivating the stainless samādhi, one contemplates the hell realm. By causal‑condition contemplation there is compassion; by emptiness contemplation there is compassion; by provisional contemplation there is compassion; by middle contemplation there is compassion. When contemplating by causal conditions, compassion pulls out the suffering of hell‑black karma. When contemplating by causal conditions, loving‑kindness gives the joy of white‑karma. When contemplating by emptiness, compassion pulls out the suffering of view and thought; when contemplating by emptiness, loving‑kindness gives outflow‑free joy. When contemplating by the provisional, compassion pulls out dust‑and‑sand suffering; when contemplating by the provisional, loving‑kindness gives the joy of the wisdom of the way‑seeds. When contemplating by the middle, compassion pulls out the suffering of ignorance; when contemplating by the middle, loving‑kindness gives the joy of dharma‑nature. This is that the hells have machines of good and evil that hinge upon the response of stainless‑samādhi compassion. Pulling out suffering and giving joy is the meaning of correspondence.

二者、機關相對者，地獄界中黑業之惡，有微義、有關義、有宜義。如此三機，即關無垢三昧時，慈悲有赴義、有對義、有應義。地獄白業，亦有六義相對，即空、見思、塵沙、無明等。善惡皆具六義相對(云云)。

> Second, correspondence of machine‑hinge: in the hell realm, the evil of black karma has the meanings of subtlety, hinge, and suitability. These three machines, when hinging upon the stainless samādhi, compassion has the meanings of going‑to, matching, and responding. The white karma of the hells also has six meanings of correspondence: emptiness, view‑and‑thought, dust‑and‑sand, ignorance, and so on. Good and evil both fully have the six meanings of correspondence (and so on).

三者、三十六句相對者，地獄黑白業具有冥機冥應、冥機顯應、顯機顯應、顯機冥應，即關無垢三昧慈悲，冥顯四應，赴於地獄。見思、即空，塵沙、種智，無明、中道等，皆具四機、四應相對(云云)。又地獄有冥顯三十六機，即對無垢三昧三十六應(云云)。

> Third, correspondence of the thirty‑six sentences: the black and white karma of hell fully have hidden‑machine hidden‑response, hidden‑machine manifest‑response, manifest‑machine manifest‑response, manifest‑machine hidden‑response; thus hinging upon stainless samādhi compassion, the four responses of hidden and manifest go to the hells. View‑and‑thought with emptiness, dust‑and‑sand with seed‑wisdom, ignorance with the middle way, and so on, all fully have four machines and four responses in correspondence (and so on). Also, the hells have thirty‑six machines of hidden and manifest, corresponding to the thirty‑six responses of the stainless samādhi (and so on).

四者、別圓相對者，若地獄有歷別之機，三昧應即歷別。若有圓普之機，三昧應亦圓普。若歷別機起，三昧別應，一有業謝，餘有業未必謝；三惡思盡，餘有思未必盡；地獄道種智明，餘有未必明；地獄佛性了了，餘有未必了了。若作圓機、圓應者。地獄自在業未究竟，餘有亦未究竟；一有見思未盡，餘有亦未盡；一有道種未明，餘有亦未明；一有佛性未了了，餘有亦未了了。一有了了，餘有亦了了；乃至一有業自在，餘有業亦自在。分別地獄機、應相對如上說。餘二十四有機、應相對，例亦如是。

> Fourth, correspondence of distinct and perfect: if the hells have distinct machines, the samādhi response is distinct; if they have universal‑perfect machines, the samādhi response is also universal‑perfect. If distinct machines arise, the samādhi response is distinct: in one existence, karma is ended, in other existences karma may not be ended; when the three evil thoughts are ended, other thoughts may not be ended; when hell seed‑wisdom is clear, others may not be clear; when hell Buddha‑nature is clear, others may not be clear. If one makes perfect machine and perfect response: hell self‑mastery karma is not yet complete, other existences are also not complete; in one existence view‑and‑thought are not yet ended, other existences are also not ended; in one existence the way‑seeds are not yet clear, other existences are also not clear; in one existence Buddha‑nature is not yet clear, other existences are also not clear. When one is clear, the others are also clear; up to when one has mastery of karma, the others also have mastery of karma. Differentiating the hells’ machine‑response correspondences is as said above. The other twenty‑four existences’ machine‑response correspondences are likewise by analogy.

問：

> Question:

頗有善機惡應、惡機善應，偏機圓應、圓機偏應不？

> Are there cases of good machine with evil response, evil machine with good response, partial machine with perfect response, perfect machine with partial response?

答：

> Answer:

無方適時，亦有此義。《淨名》云：「或時現風火，照令知無常。」即惡應於善也。妙莊嚴信受邪惡，三菩薩應為妻子，即善應於惡。圓機偏應者，一切智願猶在不失，不失即圓機；教聲聞法，即偏應也。偏機圓應者，先引三車，後與一大。領解云：「無上寶聚，不求自得。」即其義也。拔樂與苦，例此可知(云云)。

> There is no fixed rule; in accord with the time, there is also this meaning. The *Vimalakīrti* says: “At times he manifests wind and fire, illuminating them to make [beings] know impermanence.” This is evil response to good. The Wonderful‑Adorned [king] trusts and receives evil; the three bodhisattvas respond by being his wives—this is good response to evil. A perfect machine with partial response: the wish of omniscience still remains and does not fail; not failing is perfect machine; teaching the śrāvaka dharma is partial response. A partial machine with perfect response: first he leads with three carts, afterward gives one great [cart]. The “understanding and acceptance” says: “The unsurpassed treasure‑heap, not seeking yet obtained.” This is the meaning. Pulling out joy and suffering can be understood by analogy (and so on).

第五明麁妙者，即為三意：一、明機之麁妙。二、明應之麁妙。三、明開麁顯妙。

> Fifth, clarifying coarse and subtle is precisely three intentions: (1) clarifying the coarse and subtle of the machine; (2) clarifying the coarse and subtle of the response; (3) clarifying opening the coarse to reveal the subtle.

一、機麁妙者，如樂間地獄，此樂因微善故。《立世毘曇》云：「人養六畜，飲飴溫清者，在熱地獄得冷間，寒地獄得溫間。」若從此義，樂間得論十法界機。阿鼻無樂間則無事善，云何具十？然阿鼻有性善不斷故。又近世雖無事善，遠劫或有，惡強善弱，冥伏未發，若遇因緣，發亦何定。是故阿鼻得具十機。即判麁妙，九界機為麁，佛界機為妙。麁機召方便應，此機有熟、未熟；方便應有淺、有深。機熟者，被應；未熟者，未應。應淺深者，如從無間得之於間，出地獄至畜生，出畜生至鬼，出三惡至人天，出人天至二乘等，悉是機之生、熟，應之淺、深，悉屬麁機攝。

> First, the coarse and subtle of the machine: like the pleasurable interval hell, this pleasure is due to slight good. The *Lishi Vibhāṣā* says: “Those who raise six kinds of livestock and drink warm sweet water obtain a cool interval in the hot hells and a warm interval in the cold hells.” If one follows this meaning, the pleasurable interval can discuss the ten‑dharma‑realm machine. Avīci has no pleasurable interval, thus has no phenomenal good—how can it fully have ten? Yet Avīci has inherent good that is not cut off. And in recent times, though there is no phenomenal good, in distant kalpas there may have been; evil is strong and good is weak, hidden and not yet aroused; if conditions are met, who can fix whether it will arouse? Therefore Avīci can have the ten machines. Thus one judges coarse and subtle: machines of the nine realms are coarse; machines of the Buddha realm are subtle. Coarse machines summon expedient responses; these machines have ripe and unripe; expedient responses have shallow and deep. When machines are ripe, they are met by responses; when unripe, they are not responded to. The shallowness and depth of responses are like: from uninterrupted [hell] obtaining an interval, from hell to animals, from animals to ghosts, from the three evil [paths] to humans and devas, from humans and devas to the two vehicles, and so on—these are all the ripeness and unripe of machines and the shallow and deep of responses, all belonging to coarse machines.

妙機召究竟妙應，妙機亦有生、熟；妙應亦有淺、深。如慈童女在於地獄，代人受罪即得生天，此乃妙機淺、熟，近在乎天耳。其餘例可知。

> Subtle machines summon ultimate subtle responses; subtle machines also have birth and ripening; subtle responses also have shallow and deep. Like the maiden Ci in hell, undergoing suffering in place of others and immediately gaining rebirth in heaven—this is a subtle machine that is shallow and ripe, near to the heavens. The rest can be known by analogy.

二明應有麁妙者，聖人慈悲誓願，願持於行，如物有膠，任運與機相著。故慈善根力，手出師子。若無誓願，雖觀苦、樂，不能拔、與。以慈力故，隨機麁、妙，先熟先應，後熟後應。三藏、通教等聖，亦得有應，但是作意神通，譬如圖寫，經紀乃成，覈論無本。何者？灰身滅智，無常住本，約何起應？若別接通，別惑未斷，亦不得應，縱令赴物，皆名麁應也。若別、圓兩教，初心伏惑，未能有應。初地、初住三觀現前，證二十五三昧。法身清淨，無染如虛空，湛然應一切，無思無念隨機即對。如一月不降，百水不升，而隨河短長，任器規矩，無前無後一時普現，此是不思議妙應也。又如明鏡，表裏清澈，一像千像，無所簡擇，不須功力，任運像似，是名妙應。此是相待論感應妙也。

> Second, clarifying that responses have coarse and subtle: sages’ compassionate vows, vows held in practice, are like a thing with glue, naturally attaching to the machine. Therefore the power of loving‑kindness good‑roots, [with a] hand produces a lion. If there are no vows, even though one contemplates suffering and joy, one cannot pull out or give. By the power of loving‑kindness, following the machine coarse or subtle, the ripe respond first, the unripe respond later. The sages of the Tripiṭaka and Common teachings can also have responses, but they are intentional supernormal powers, like a drawing that only completes after measuring and planning; examining it, it has no basis. Why? If one ashes the body and extinguishes wisdom, there is no abiding basis; from what could response arise? If the distinct connects to the common and distinct delusions are not yet cut off, it also cannot respond; even if it goes to things, all are named coarse response. If the distinct and perfect teachings, at the initial mind, still subdue delusions and cannot yet respond. At the first ground and first abode, the three contemplations appear, and one realizes the twenty‑five samādhis. The Dharma‑body is pure, unstained like empty space, serenely responding to all, without thought and without mind, responding to the machine as it comes. Like one moon not descending, a hundred waters not rising, yet according to the lengths of rivers and the shapes of vessels, without before or after, it appears everywhere at once—this is the inconceivable subtle response. Again, like a bright mirror, inside and out clear, one image or a thousand images, choosing nothing, without effort, naturally appearing—this is named subtle response. This is the relative discussion of stimulus‑response subtlety.

三開麁顯妙者：若九界機麁，一界機妙；未得法身應麁，得法身應妙者，諸大乘經《華嚴》等，明麁妙相隔，二乘不聞不解，如瘂如聾。《無量義經》明麁妙，從一理出生無量麁妙機應；一理為妙，生出無量為麁。此則從妙出麁，隔而未合。今經無量還為一，此則開權顯實，秖麁是妙。何者？本顯一理，作諸方便；方便即是真實。故云：凡有所作，唯為一事，未曾暫廢。譬如三草、二木，秖是一地所生，即是同源機一。一雨所潤，即是同受應一。愚者未解，謂草木四微，永非是地；智者了達四微生秖是地變，四微滅秖是地還，豈有草木而非於地耶！此即開權而顯實，決了聲聞法，是諸經之王。九法界機，皆佛界機；四聖之應，無非妙應也。

> Third, opening the coarse to reveal the subtle: if the machines of the nine realms are coarse and the machine of one realm is subtle; if response without attaining the Dharma‑body is coarse and response after attaining the Dharma‑body is subtle—then the various Mahāyāna sūtras such as the *Avataṃsaka* clarify coarse and subtle as separated; the two vehicles do not hear or understand, like the dumb and the deaf. The *Sūtra of Immeasurable Meanings* clarifies coarse and subtle: from one principle arise immeasurable coarse and subtle machines and responses; one principle is subtle, what arises in immeasurable is coarse. This is coarse coming from subtle, separated and not yet united. Now this sūtra returns the immeasurable to one: this is opening the provisional and revealing the real; the coarse is precisely subtle. Why? Originally one reveals one principle and makes various expedients; expedients are precisely the real. Therefore it says: whatever is done is only for one matter, never for a moment abandoned. It is like three grasses and two trees: all are born from one ground, thus the same‑source machine is one. One rain moistens them, thus the same‑received response is one. The foolish do not understand and say the four elements of grasses and trees are forever not the ground; the wise thoroughly realize that the four elements’ arising is simply the ground’s transformation, the four elements’ ceasing is simply the ground’s return—how could there be grasses and trees that are not the ground? This is opening the provisional and revealing the real, decisively clarifying the śrāvaka dharma—the king of sūtras. The machines of the nine dharma realms are all the machines of the Buddha realm; the responses of the four sages are nothing but subtle responses.

第六明觀心(云云)。

> Sixth, clarifying contemplation of mind (and so on).
