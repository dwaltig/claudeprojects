## ○第六明感應妙
# The Sixth [Subtlety]: Resonance Subtlety

---

### Why Resonance After Three Dharmas

上來四妙名為圓因，三法祕藏名為圓果...果智寂照，有感必彰，故明感應妙也。

> The previous four subtleties are called **Perfect Causes**; the Three Dharmas Secret Treasury is called **Perfect Fruit**...
> **Fruit-wisdom is quiescent-yet-illuminating; when there is a stimulus, it must manifest response**—hence we clarify Resonance Subtlety.

---

### Six Topics

即為六：一、釋感應名。二、明相。三、明同異。四、明相對。五、明麁妙。六、明觀心。

> This has **six topics**:
> 1. Explaining the names "stimulus" and "response"
> 2. Explaining their marks
> 3. Explaining sameness and difference
> 4. Explaining correspondence
> 5. Explaining coarse and subtle
> 6. Explaining mind-contemplation

## 一、釋名 — Explaining the Names

---

### Three Meanings of "Machine" (機)

機有三義：

> **"Machine"** (機, stimulus/capacity) has three meanings:

#### 1. Machine = Subtle (微)

一者、機是微義。故《易》云：「機者，動之微，吉之先現。」

> First, machine means **subtle**. Hence the *Yijing* says: "The machine is **subtlety of movement, the forerunner of fortune**."

又《阿含》云：「眾生有善法之機，聖人來應也。」

> Also the *Āgama* says: "Sentient beings have a machine of wholesome dharmas; **the sage comes to respond**."

如弩有可發之機，故射者發之，發之則箭動，不發則不前；眾生有可生之善，故聖應則善生，不應則不生。

> Like a crossbow has a triggerable machine—hence the archer triggers it: triggered, the arrow moves; not triggered, it stays still. Sentient beings have producible good; hence **when the sage responds, good arises; without response, it does not arise**.

#### 2. Machine = Hinge/Gate (關)

二者、《古注楞伽經》云：「機是關義。」何者？眾生有善有惡，關聖慈悲，故機是關義也。

> Second, the *Ancient Commentary on the Laṅkāvatāra* says: "Machine means **hinge/gate**." Why? Sentient beings have good and evil that **hinge upon the sage's compassion**—hence machine means gate.

#### 3. Machine = Suitability (宜)

三者、機是宜義。如欲拔無明之苦，正宜於悲；欲與法性之樂，正宜於慈，故機是宜義也。

> Third, machine means **suitability**. If one wishes to uproot ignorance-suffering, this is precisely suitable to compassion. If one wishes to give dharma-nature joy, this is precisely suitable to loving-kindness. Hence **machine means suitability**.

---

### Three Meanings of "Response" (應)

次明應者，亦為三義：

> Next, explaining **"response"** (應) also has three meanings:

#### 1. Response = Going-to (赴)

一者、應是赴義。既言機有可生之理，機微將動，聖人赴之，其善得生，故用赴而釋應。

> First, response means **going-to**. Since we say the machine has a principle of producibility, when the machine subtly stirs, **the sage goes to it and good arises**—hence we explain response as "going-to."

#### 2. Response = Matching (對)

二者、應是對義。如人交關，更相主對，若一欲賣，一不欲買，則不相主對；若賣買兩和，則貿易交決...

> Second, response means **matching**. Like people doing business, mutually corresponding—if one wants to sell but the other doesn't want to buy, they don't correspond. If both buyer and seller agree, the trade is completed...

今以眾生譬買，如來譬賣，就機以論關，就應以論對，故以對釋應也。

> Now, taking sentient beings as buyer and Tathāgata as seller—**regarding machine we discuss the hinge; regarding response we discuss the match**—hence we explain response as "matching."

#### 3. Response = Responding (應)

三者、應是應義。既言機是於宜，宜何等法？應以慈悲之法，是善惡所宜。

> Third, response means **responding**. Since we say machine is suitability, suitable for what dharma? **Responding with compassion-dharmas that suit good and evil**.

---

## 二、明機應相 — Marks of Stimulus and Response

---

### Good and Evil as Machine

若善惡為機，為單？為共？...或取善惡相帶為機者，從闡提起改悔心，上至等覺，皆有善惡相帶，故得為機。

> If good and evil are machines, are they single or combined?... Taking **good and evil interlinked** as machine: from icchantika arising repentant mind up to Equal Awakening, all have good and evil interlinked—hence they can be machines.

---

### Three Worlds of Machine

眾生善惡有三世，何世為機？...通論，三世善惡皆為機；別論，但取未來善惡為正機也。何者？過去已謝，現在已定，秖為拔未來惡，生未來善耳。

> Sentient beings' good and evil have three times—which time is the machine?... **Generally speaking, three-times good and evil are all machines. Specifically speaking, only future good and evil are the primary machines.** Why? The past has passed, the present is fixed—it is only for **uprooting future evil and producing future good**.

---

## 三、明機感不同 — Different Types of Stimulus-Response

---

### The Four Sentences (四句)

今略言為四：

> Now speaking briefly as **four**:

| # | Type | Description |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Hidden machine, hidden response** (冥機冥應) | Past good activates; no visible miracle, but secretly benefited by Dharma-body |
| 2 | **Hidden machine, manifest response** (冥機顯應) | Past good ripens; now meets Buddha, hears Dharma, obtains benefit |
| 3 | **Manifest machine, manifest response** (顯機顯應) | Present practice is vigorous; obtains visible spiritual response |
| 4 | **Manifest machine, hidden response** (顯機冥應) | Present practice is strong but no visible response; hidden benefit |

---

### Hidden Machine, Hidden Response (冥機冥應)

若過去善修三業，現在未運身口，藉往善力名此為冥機也。雖不現見靈應，而密為法身所益。不見不聞而覺而知，是名為冥益也。

> If in the past one cultivated the three karmas in wholesome ways, and in the present has not yet activated body and speech, relying on past wholesome power—this is called **hidden machine**. Though one does not visibly see spiritual response, one is **secretly benefited by Dharma-body**. Not seeing, not hearing, yet awakening and knowing—this is called **hidden benefit**.

---

### Hidden Machine, Manifest Response (冥機顯應)

冥機顯益者，過去殖善而冥機已成，便得值佛聞法，現前獲利是為顯益。

> **Hidden machine, manifest benefit**: Past-planted good makes the hidden machine complete; one then **meets Buddha, hears Dharma, obtains benefit in the present**—this is manifest benefit.

如佛初出世，最初得度之人，現在何甞修行？諸佛照其宿機，自往度之，即其義也。

> When the Buddha first appeared in the world, the first people to be liberated—had they cultivated in the present? **Buddhas illuminate their past machines and go to liberate them**—this is that meaning.

---

### Manifest Machine, Manifest Response (顯機顯應)

顯機顯應者，現在身口，精勤不懈，而能感降。如須達長跪，佛往祇洹，月蓋曲躬，聖居門閫。

> **Manifest machine, manifest response**: Present body and speech are diligently tireless, and able to evoke descent. Like Sudatta kneeling long, Buddha went to Jetavana. Like Candrachatra bowing, the sage resided at his door.

如即行人，道場禮懺，能感靈瑞，即是顯機顯應也。

> Like practitioners in the practice-hall performing repentance, **able to evoke spiritual auspiciousness**—this is manifest machine, manifest response.

---

### Manifest Machine, Hidden Response (顯機冥應)

顯機冥應者，如人雖一世勤苦，現善濃積而不顯感，冥有其利，此是顯機冥益。

> **Manifest machine, hidden response**: Like a person who toils diligently their whole life, present good thickly accumulated but no manifest response—**there is hidden benefit**—this is manifest machine, hidden benefit.

---

### The Practical Takeaway

若解四意，一切低頭舉手，福不虛棄，終日無感，終日無悔。

> **If you understand these four meanings, every bow of the head and raising of the hand—merit is not discarded in vain. Though all day without visible response, all day without regret.**

若見喜殺壽長，好施貧乏，不生邪見；若不解此者，謂其徒功喪計，憂悔失理。

> If you see those who enjoy killing yet live long, or those who love giving yet are impoverished—**do not generate wrong views**. If one doesn't understand this, one thinks one's efforts are wasted and regrets losing principle.

---

## Thirty-Six Sentences (三十六句)

若具足辨者，用四機為根本，所謂冥機、顯機、亦冥亦顯機、非冥非顯機。

> If we fully analyze, we use **four machines as roots**: hidden, manifest, both hidden-and-manifest, neither hidden-nor-manifest.

冥是過去，顯是現在，冥顯是過現，非冥非顯是未來。

> **Hidden is past; manifest is present; both is past-and-present; neither is future.**

於一句中，復為四句...四四即成十六句。機既召應，應亦有十六句。

> Within one sentence, there are again four sentences... Four times four makes **sixteen sentences**. Machine calls response; response also has sixteen sentences.

一機而感四應，一應而赴四機，機應各為十六，合成三十二句。就前根本四句，便是三十六句機應也。

> **One machine stimulates four responses; one response goes to four machines**—machine and response each are sixteen, combining to make thirty-two sentences. Adding the root four sentences makes **thirty-six sentences of stimulus-response**.

---

## 五、明麁妙 — Coarse and Subtle

---

### Machine Coarse and Subtle

九界機為麁，佛界機為妙。麁機召方便應...

> **Nine-realm machines are coarse; Buddha-realm machine is subtle.** Coarse machines call skillful-means responses...

妙機召究竟妙應，妙機亦有生、熟；妙應亦有淺、深。

> **Subtle machines call ultimate subtle responses**; subtle machines also have unripe and ripe; subtle responses also have shallow and deep.

---

### Response Coarse and Subtle

三藏、通教等聖，亦得有應，但是作意神通，譬如圖寫，經紀乃成，覈論無本。何者？灰身滅智，無常住本，約何起應？

> Tripiṭaka and Common Teaching sages also have responses, but these are **intentional supernatural powers**—like paintings that require deliberate effort to complete, at core without foundation. Why? **Ash-body, extinguished-wisdom—no constant-abiding foundation—from what does response arise?**

若別、圓兩教，初心伏惑，未能有應。初地、初住三觀現前，證二十五三昧。法身清淨，無染如虛空，湛然應一切，無思無念隨機即對。

> If Distinct and Perfect teachings, the initial mind subdues delusion but cannot yet have response. At first ground or first abiding, when the three contemplations are present, one realizes the twenty-five samādhis. **Dharma-body is pure, undefiled like empty space, tranquil yet responding to all, without thought or intention, immediately matching the machine.**

---

### The Mirror Simile

如一月不降，百水不升，而隨河短長，任器規矩，無前無後一時普現，此是不思議妙應也。

> Like the one moon does not descend, the hundred waters do not rise, yet **following rivers' length, conforming to vessels' shapes, without before or after, simultaneously universally manifesting**—this is **inconceivable subtle response**.

又如明鏡，表裏清澈，一像千像，無所簡擇，不須功力，任運像似，是名妙應。

> Also like a **bright mirror**, clear inside and out, one image or a thousand images, **no selection, no effort required, naturally resembling**—this is called subtle response.

---

## 開麁顯妙 — Opening Coarse to Reveal Subtle

今經無量還為一，此則開權顯實，秖麁是妙。

> This sūtra returns the immeasurable to one—this is **opening expedient to reveal real; the coarse itself is subtle**.

如三草、二木，秖是一地所生，即是同源機一。一雨所潤，即是同受應一。

> Like three grasses and two trees, they are simply **produced from one ground—same-source machine is one**. Moistened by one rain—**same-received response is one**.

愚者未解，謂草木四微，永非是地；智者了達四微生秖是地變，四微滅秖是地還，豈有草木而非於地耶！

> The foolish don't understand, thinking grasses and trees' four elements are forever not the ground. **The wise thoroughly comprehend**: four elements arising is simply ground transforming; four elements ceasing is simply returning to ground—**how could grass and trees not be the ground?**

此即開權而顯實，決了聲聞法，是諸經之王。九法界機，皆佛界機；四聖之應，無非妙應也。

> This is **opening expedient to reveal real**, definitively clarifying śrāvaka dharma—this is the king of sūtras. **Nine-realm machines are all Buddha-realm machines; responses of the four sages are nothing but subtle responses.**

## Summary Table: Four Sentences of Resonance

| Type | Machine | Response | Example |
|------|---------|----------|---------|

| 冥機顯應 | Past good (hidden) | Meeting Buddha (manifest) | First disciples at Buddha's arising |
| 顯機顯應 | Present practice (manifest) | Visible miracle (manifest) | Sudatta and Jetavana |
| 顯機冥應 | Present practice (manifest) | Hidden benefit only | Lifelong practice, no visible sign |

## Footnotes

[^1]: The **Four Sentences** (四句) of resonance are Master Zhiyi's analysis of how spiritual practice relates to spiritual response. This teaching is profoundly pastoral: it explains why sincere practitioners may not see visible results (hidden response to manifest machine), and why unexpected transformations occur (manifest response to hidden machine). The key teaching: "Every bow of the head—merit is not discarded in vain."
