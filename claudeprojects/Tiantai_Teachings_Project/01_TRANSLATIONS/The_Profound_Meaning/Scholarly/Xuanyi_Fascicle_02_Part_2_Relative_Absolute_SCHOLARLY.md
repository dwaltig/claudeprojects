## △二、明妙者
# The Clarification of "Wonderful"

---

一、通釋，二、別釋。

> [This section has] two parts: (1) General interpretation, (2) Particular interpretation.

通又為二：一、相待，二、絕待。

> The general interpretation also has two parts: (1) **Relative** (相待), (2) **Absolute** (絕待).

此經唯論二妙，更無非絕非待之文。若更作者，絕何惑？顯何理？故不更論也。

> This sūtra discusses only these two kinds of Wonderful; there is no text about "neither absolute nor relative." If we were to posit another [kind], what delusion would it sever? What principle would it reveal? Therefore we do not discuss [a third].

---

## 一、相待明妙
# Section 1: The Relative Wonderful (相待妙)

---

光宅用《法華》之妙，待前諸教皆麁。巨有所妨，已如前難(云云)。

> Guangzhai used the *Lotus Sūtra's* Wonderful to contrast [it] with all previous teachings as coarse. This has great problems, as already critiqued above.

今待麁妙者，待半字為麁，明滿字為妙，亦是常無常、大小相待，為麁妙也。

> **The present Relative Wonderful:** contrasting the *half-word* [teaching] as coarse, clarifying the *full-word* [teaching] as wonderful. This is also constant/impermanent, great/small mutually contrasted—as coarse and wonderful.[^1]

---

### Scriptural Evidence for Relative Wonderful

《淨名》云：「說法不有亦不無，以因緣故諸法生。」即是明滿字也。始坐佛樹力降魔，得甘露滅覺道成，即提昔之半待出於滿也。

> The *Vimalakīrti* says: "Teaching the Dharma is neither existent nor non-existent; through causes and conditions, all dharmas arise." This clarifies the full-word [teaching]. "First sitting at the Bodhi Tree, with power subduing Māra, attaining the sweet-dew extinction, the *bodhi* path achieved"—this lifts up the former half-word in contrast to manifest the full.

《般若》云：「於閻浮提見第二法輪轉。」亦是對鹿苑為第一，待般若為第二也。

> The *Prajñā[pāramitā]* says: "In Jambudvīpa, seeing the second turning of the Dharma wheel." This also contrasts the Deer Park as first, waiting for *Prajñā* as second.

《涅槃》云：「昔於波羅柰初轉法輪，今於尸城復轉法輪。」

> The *Nirvāṇa [Sūtra]* says: "Formerly at Vārāṇasī I first turned the Dharma wheel; now at the city of Kuśinagara I again turn the Dharma wheel."

眾經皆共以鹿苑為半、為小、為麁，待此明滿、大、妙，其義是同。

> All sūtras together take the Deer Park as half, as small, as coarse—contrasted with this [later teaching] as full, great, and wonderful. The meaning is the same.

今《法華》明昔於波羅柰，轉四諦法輪，五眾之生滅。今復轉最妙、無上之法輪。此亦待鹿苑為麁，法華為妙。妙義皆同，待麁亦等，文義在此也。

> Now the *Lotus* clarifies: "Formerly at Vārāṇasī, [I] turned the Dharma wheel of the Four Noble Truths, the arising and ceasing of the five aggregates. Now I again turn the most wonderful, unsurpassed Dharma wheel." This also contrasts the Deer Park as coarse, the *Lotus* as wonderful. The meaning of "wonderful" is the same; the contrast with "coarse" is also equal. The text and meaning lie here.

### The Three Teachings All Share This Structure

問：齊方等來，滿理無殊者，悉應稱妙？

> **Q:** From *Vaipulya* onward, if the full principle is not different, should all be called wonderful?

答：今亦不尅教定時，那忽云齊方等耶？縱令爾者，別有所以。何者？利根菩薩於彼入妙，與《法華》不異。鈍根菩薩及二乘人猶帶方便，諸味調伏。

> **A:** We do not precisely fix teachings to times—how can you suddenly speak of "from *Vaipulya*"? Even granting that: there is a separate reason. Sharp-rooted bodhisattvas at that [point] enter the Wonderful no differently from the *Lotus*. Dull-rooted bodhisattvas and Two Vehicle people still carry expedients; the various flavors discipline [them].

方等帶生蘇論妙以待麁；般若帶熟蘇論妙以待麁；今經無二味方便，純真醍醐論妙以待麁。此妙、彼妙，妙義無殊；但以帶方便、不帶方便為異耳。

> *Vaipulya* brings fresh butter in discussing the Wonderful to contrast the coarse. *Prajñā* brings aged butter in discussing the Wonderful to contrast the coarse. **This present sūtra has no two-flavor expedients—pure true ghee discusses the Wonderful to contrast the coarse.** This Wonderful and that Wonderful—the meaning of "wonderful" is not different. The only difference is bringing expedients or not bringing expedients.

復次，三藏但半字生滅門，不能通滿理，故名為麁。滿字是不生不滅門，能通滿理，故名妙。能通滿理，復有二種：一、帶方便通滿理，二、直顯滿理。方等、般若帶方便通滿理，今經直顯滿理。故《中論》云：「為鈍根弟子說因緣生滅相；為利根弟子說因緣不生不滅相(云云)。」《中論》偈(云云)。若不即空為通真方便，是故言麁；若能即空是通中方便。通中方便，若帶即空即假通中者麁；不帶空假直通中者妙(云云)。

> Furthermore, the Tripiṭaka is only the half‑word gate of arising and ceasing; it cannot penetrate the full principle, therefore it is called coarse. The full word is the gate of non‑arising and non‑ceasing; it can penetrate the full principle, therefore it is called wonderful. To penetrate the full principle there are two kinds: (1) penetrating the full principle with expedients, (2) directly revealing the full principle. *Vaipulya* and *Prajñā* use expedients to penetrate the full principle; this sūtra directly reveals the full principle. Therefore the *Madhyamaka‑śāstra* says: "For dull‑rooted disciples, [it] speaks the marks of dependent arising and ceasing; for sharp‑rooted disciples, [it] speaks the marks of dependent arising as non‑arising and non‑ceasing (and so on)." The *Madhyamaka‑śāstra* verse (and so on). If one does not take "emptiness" as the expedient that penetrates the true, therefore it is called coarse. If one can take "emptiness," this is the expedient that penetrates the Middle. The expedient that penetrates the Middle—if it still carries "emptiness and provisional" to penetrate the Middle, it is coarse; if it does not carry emptiness and provisional and directly penetrates the Middle, it is wonderful (and so on).

問：

> Q:

乳至醍醐，同稱為滿，是譬云何？

> From milk to ghee, all are called "full"—what is the simile?

答：

> A:

### The Navigation Metaphor

今以譬解。譬如官有三航及以私船，從於此岸，度人彼岸。

> Now we explain with a simile. It is like the government having three ships and also private boats, ferrying people from this shore to the other shore.

乳教如大中兩航，共度人彼岸。

> The **Milk Teaching** (*Avataṃsaka*) is like large and medium ships, together ferrying people to the other shore.

酪教如私船，度人中洲。

> The **Curds Teaching** (*Tripiṭaka*) is like private boats, ferrying people to a middle island.

生蘇如四種：小航與私船，度人於中洲：兩航度人於彼岸。

> The **Fresh Butter** (*Vaipulya*) is like four kinds: small ships and private boats ferry people to the middle island; two ships ferry people to the other shore.

熟蘇如三航：一航中洲，二航彼岸。

> The **Clarified Butter** (*Prajñā*) is like three ships: one ship [goes to] the middle island, two ships to the other shore.

醍醐如大航，度人彼岸。

> The **Ghee** (*Lotus*) is like a large ship, ferrying people to the other shore.

三航同是官物，故俱稱為滿。私船非官物，是故言半。官物之中，二航小，所容蓋寡；大航壯麗，容載倍多，獨稱為妙。

> The three ships are all government property—hence all are called "full." The private boats are not government property—hence they are called "half." Among the government property, the two [smaller] ships are small, their capacity limited; the large ship is magnificent, carrying many times more—**alone called Wonderful**.

智者以譬喻得解，其譬義如是(云云)。

> The wise understand through similes; the meaning of the simile is thus.

## 二、絕待明妙
# Section 2: The Absolute Wonderful (絕待妙)

---

二、絕待明妙者，為四：

> The Absolute Wonderful has four [sub-types]:

### 2.1 Tripiṭaka Absolute

一、隨情三假法起，若入真諦，待對即絕。故身子云：「吾聞解脫之中，無有言說。」此三藏經中絕待意也。

> First: When the three provisional [dharmas] arise following sentient feeling, if one enters the true principle, the contrast is immediately severed. Therefore Śāriputra said: "I have heard that within liberation, there is no verbal expression." **This is the Absolute meaning within the Tripiṭaka.**

---

### 2.2 Common Teaching Absolute

二、若隨理三假，一切世間皆如幻化，即事而真，無有一事而非真者，更待何物為不真耶？望彼三藏，絕還不絕。即事而真，乃是絕待，此通教絕待也。

> Second: If following the three provisional [dharmas] of principle, all the world is like illusion and transformation—phenomena are precisely truth; not a single phenomenon is not truth. What further thing would one contrast as "not true"? Compared to the Tripiṭaka, this "absolute" still is not absolute. **Phenomena precisely being truth—this is absolute.** This is the **Common Teaching Absolute**.

---

### 2.3 Distinct Teaching Absolute

三、別教若起，望即真之絕，還是世諦。何者？非大涅槃，猶是生死世諦，絕還有待。若入別教中道，待則絕矣！

> Third: If the Distinct Teaching arises, compared to the "phenomena precisely truth" absolute, [that teaching] is still conventional truth. Why? [Because] it is not the Great Nirvāṇa; it is still the conventional truth of birth-and-death—the absolute still has relativity. **If one enters the Distinct Teaching's Middle Way, then the relative is severed!**

---

### 2.4 Perfect Teaching Absolute

四、圓教若起，說無分別法，即邊而中，無非佛法，亡泯清淨。豈更佛法待於佛法？如來法界故，出法界外，無復有法可相形比。待誰為麁？形誰得妙？無所可待，亦無所絕，不知何名，強言為絕。

> Fourth: **If the Perfect Teaching arises, teaching the dharma of no-discrimination**—precisely the extreme is the Middle; nothing is not Buddha-dharma; annihilated and extinguished, pure. How could Buddha-dharma further contrast Buddha-dharma? Because of the Tathāgata's Dharma-Realm, outside the Dharma-Realm there is no further dharma that can be compared. **Whom would one contrast as coarse? Compared to whom would one be wonderful? There is nothing to contrast with, nor anything to sever.** We do not know what to call it—we forcibly speak of it as "absolute."

---

### The *Nirvāṇa Sūtra* on the Great

《大經》云：「大名不可稱量，不可思議，故名為大。譬如虛空，不因小空，名為大也。涅槃亦爾，不因小相，名大涅槃。」妙亦如是，妙名不可思議，不因於麁而名為妙。

> The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "**The name 'Great' cannot be weighed or measured; it is inconceivable—hence called 'Great.'** It is like empty space: it is not called 'great' because of small space. Nirvāṇa is also thus; it is not called 'Great Nirvāṇa' because of lesser marks." **Wonderful is also thus: "Wonderful" cannot be conceived; it is not called "Wonderful" because of [contrast with] the coarse.**

---

### The Lotus Sutra on Inexpressibility

若謂定有法界廣大獨絕者，此則大有所有，何謂為絕？今法界清淨，非見聞覺知，不可說示。

> If one claims there is definitely a Dharma-Realm that is vast and uniquely absolute, then this "great" would have something to possess—how would it be "absolute"? **The Dharma-Realm is now pure—not seeing, hearing, awareness, or cognition—it cannot be spoken or shown.**

文云：「止止不須說，我法妙難思。」止止不須說，即是絕言；我法妙難思，即是絕思。

> The text says: "**Stop, stop—no need to speak. My Dharma is wonderful and hard to conceive.**" "Stop, stop—no need to speak"—this is **severance of speech**. "My Dharma is wonderful and hard to conceive"—this is **severance of thought**.

又云：「是法不可示，言辭相寂滅。」亦是絕歎之文。不可以待示，不可以絕示，滅待滅絕，故言寂滅。

> And: "**This Dharma cannot be shown; the marks of words are extinguished.**" This is also text of absolute wonder. It cannot be shown through relativity, cannot be shown through absoluteness—eliminating relativity, eliminating absoluteness—hence "extinguished."

又云：「一切諸法，常寂滅相，終歸於空。」此空亦空，則無復待絕。

> And: "**All dharmas constantly have the mark of extinction; they finally return to emptiness.**" This emptiness is also empty—then there is no more relativity or absoluteness.

---

### The Middle Way Neither Arises nor Produces Arising

《中論》云：「若法為待成，是法還成待。」今則無因待，亦無所成。《法華》首云：「既得無生忍，亦不生無生。」無生即無生，是名絕待。

> The *Madhyamaka-śāstra* says: "**If a dharma is established through relativity, that dharma in turn establishes relativity.**" Now there is no cause of relativity, nor anything established. The *Lotus* opening says: "**Having attained the patience of non-arising, one also does not give rise to non-arising.**" Non-arising is precisely non-arising—**this is called Absolute Wonderful**.

---

### Warning Against Further Proliferation

降此已外，若更作者，絕何物？顯何理？流浪無窮，則墮戲論。乃是迷情分別，絕待不絕，非絕非待待於亦待亦絕，言語相逐，永無絕矣！

> Beyond this, if one were to posit further [categories], what would one sever? What principle would one reveal? Wandering endlessly, one would fall into idle talk. This is confused feeling making discriminations—"absolute" not absolute, "neither absolute nor relative" contrasting "both relative and absolute"—words chasing words, never absolute!

何者？言語從覺觀生，心慮不息，語何由絕？如癡犬逐塊，徒自疲勞，塊終不絕。若能妙悟寰中，息覺觀風，心水澄清，言思皆絕。如黠師子放塊逐人，塊本既除，塊則絕矣！

> Why? Words arise from investigation and discrimination; if mental deliberation does not cease, how could words be severed? It is like a **foolish dog chasing a clod**—tiring itself in vain; the clods never end. If one can wonderfully awaken within the realm, ceasing the wind of investigation and discrimination, the water of mind becomes clear—words and thoughts are both severed. It is like a **clever lion that releases the clod and chases the person**—the source of clods having been removed, the clods are then severed![^2]

妙悟之時，洞知法界外無法而論絕者，約有門明絕也。是絕亦絕，約空門明絕也。如快馬見鞭影，無不得入，是名絕待妙也。用是兩妙，妙上三法。眾生之法，亦具二妙，稱之為妙。佛法、心法，亦具二妙，稱之為妙。

> At the time of wonderful awakening, knowing thoroughly that outside the Dharma‑Realm there is no dharma and yet speaking of "absolute"—this clarifies absolute in terms of the gate of existence. That absolute is also absolute—this clarifies absolute in terms of the gate of emptiness. Like a fast horse seeing the whip’s shadow, there is nowhere it does not enter—this is called the Absolute Wonderful. Using these two wonders, the three dharmas are made wonderful. Sentient‑being dharma also possesses two wonders and is called wonderful. Buddha dharma and mind dharma also possess two wonders and are called wonderful.

若將上四種絕待約五味經者，乳教兩絕，酪教一絕，生蘇四絕，熟蘇三絕，此經但有一絕。若開權絕者，無不入一妙絕也。

> If one applies the four kinds of absolute above to the Five‑Flavor teachings, the Milk Teaching has two absolutes, the Curds Teaching has one absolute, Fresh Butter has four absolutes, Clarified Butter has three absolutes, and this sūtra has only one absolute. If one opens the provisional and absolutizes, there is nothing that does not enter a single wonderful absolute.

問：

> Q:

何意以絕釋妙？

> Why use "absolute" to explain "wonderful"?

答：

> A:

秖喚妙為絕，絕是妙之異名，如世人稱絕能耳。又妙是能絕，麁是所絕，此妙有絕麁之功，故舉絕以名妙。如迹中先施方便之教，大教不得起。今大教若起，方便教絕，將所絕以名於妙耳。又迹中大教既起，本地大教不得興。今本地教興，迹中大教即絕。絕於迹大，功由本大，將絕迹之大，名於本大，故言絕也。又本大教若興，觀心之妙不得起。今入觀緣寂，言語道斷，本教即絕。絕由於觀，將此絕名，名於觀妙，為顯此義，故以絕為妙。

> One simply calls the wonderful "absolute"; "absolute" is an alternate name for "wonderful," like people in the world calling [something] "absolute ability." Moreover, the wonderful is what can sever; the coarse is what is severed. This wonderful has the function of severing the coarse—therefore we raise "absolute" to name the wonderful. For example, in the Trace, the expedient teaching was first set forth, so the great teaching could not arise. Now if the great teaching arises, the expedient teaching is severed; we take what is severed to name the wonderful. Moreover, once the great teaching in the Trace has arisen, the great teaching in the Fundamental cannot arise. Now when the Fundamental teaching arises, the great teaching in the Trace is severed. Severing the Trace‑great—its功 is due to the Fundamental‑great; we take the severing of the Trace‑great and name it the Fundamental‑great, hence we say "absolute." Moreover, if the Fundamental‑great teaching arises, the wonder of observing the mind cannot arise. Now entering contemplative conditions and quiescence, the path of words is cut off, and the Fundamental teaching is severed. The severing is due to contemplation; taking this severing as a name, we name the contemplation as wonderful. To make this meaning clear, we therefore take "absolute" as "wonderful."

今將迹之絕妙，妙上眾生法；將本地之絕妙，妙上佛法；將觀心之絕妙，妙上心法。前四絕橫約四教；今三絕竪約圓教(云云)。

> Now, using the Trace’s absolute‑wonderful to make sentient‑being dharma wonderful; using the Fundamental‑ground’s absolute‑wonderful to make Buddha dharma wonderful; using the contemplation‑of‑mind’s absolute‑wonderful to make mind dharma wonderful. The former four absolutes are horizontally in terms of the four teachings; the present three absolutes are vertically in terms of the Perfect Teaching (and so on).

## The Ten Trace Subtleties (迹中十妙)

---

△別釋妙者，為三：若鹿苑三麁，鷲頭一妙，皆迹中之說，約迹開十重論妙。此妙有迹、有本，本據元初，元初本妙十重論妙。迹本俱是教，依教作觀，觀復有十重論妙。迹中有眾生法妙、佛法妙、心法妙，各十重，合三十重。此與眾經論妙有同有異。本中三十妙，與眾經一向異。此六十重一一復有待妙、絕妙，則有一百二十重。若破麁顯妙，即用上相待妙。若開麁顯妙，即用上絕待妙(云云)。

> In the particular interpretation of the Wonderful there are three: if the Deer Park has three coarse [teachings] and Vulture Peak has one wonderful [teaching], these are statements within the Trace, opening ten layers to discuss the wonderful in terms of the Trace. This wonderful has Trace and Fundamental; the Fundamental is based on the original beginning; the original‑beginning Fundamental‑wonderful is discussed in ten layers. Trace and Fundamental are both teachings; relying on the teaching one makes contemplation, and contemplation again has ten layers to discuss the wonderful. Within the Trace there is Sentient‑Being Dharma Wonderful, Buddha Dharma Wonderful, and Mind Dharma Wonderful; each has ten layers, totaling thirty layers. This has sameness and difference with the wonderful discussed in other sūtras and śāstras. The Fundamental’s thirty wonders are uniformly different from the other sūtras. These sixty layers each again have Relative‑Wonderful and Absolute‑Wonderful, thus there are one hundred twenty layers. If one breaks the coarse to reveal the wonderful, then use the Relative‑Wonderful above. If one opens the coarse to reveal the wonderful, then use the Absolute‑Wonderful above (and so on).

迹中十妙者：一、境妙。二、智妙。三、行妙。四、位妙。五、三法妙。六、感應妙。七、神通妙。八、說法妙。九、眷屬妙。十、功德利益妙。

> The ten subtleties within the Trace are: (1) realm subtlety, (2) wisdom subtlety, (3) practice subtlety, (4) position subtlety, (5) three‑dharmas subtlety, (6) resonance subtlety, (7) supernatural‑powers subtlety, (8) teaching‑the‑Dharma subtlety, (9) retinue subtlety, (10) merit‑and‑benefit subtlety.

釋十妙為五番：一、標章。二、引證。三、生起。四、廣解。五、結權實。

> Explaining the ten subtleties has five rounds: (1) establishing the headings, (2) citing proof, (3) arising, (4) broad explanation, (5) concluding Provisional and Real.

○標章者，云何境妙？謂十如、因緣、四諦、三諦、二諦、一諦等。是諸佛所師，故稱境妙。

> Establishing the headings: What is realm subtlety? It means the Ten Suchnesses, dependent origination, Four Truths, Three Truths, Two Truths, One Truth, and the like. These are what all Buddhas take as their teacher; therefore it is called realm subtlety.

智妙者，所謂二十智，四菩提智，下、中、上、上上，七權實，五三智，一如實智，以境妙故，智亦隨妙。以法常故，諸佛亦常。函蓋相稱，境智不可思議，故稱智妙。

> Wisdom subtlety refers to the twenty wisdoms: the four bodhi‑wisdoms—lower, middle, upper, and upper‑upper; the seven provisional and real; the five of the three wisdoms; the one wisdom of true reality. Because the realm is subtle, wisdom too follows as subtle. Because the Dharma is constant, the Buddhas are also constant. Box and lid correspond; realm and wisdom are inconceivable—therefore it is called wisdom subtlety.

行妙者，謂增數行、次第五行、不次第五行，智導行故，故言行妙。

> Practice subtlety refers to the increasing‑number practices, the sequential five practices, and the non‑sequential five practices. Because wisdom guides practice, it is called practice subtlety.

位妙者，謂三草位、二木位、一實位，妙行所契，故言位妙。

> Position subtlety refers to the three‑grass position, the two‑tree position, and the one‑real position. Subtle practice accords with these—therefore it is called position subtlety.[^3]

三法妙者，謂總三法，縱三法、橫三法、不縱不橫三法、類通三法，皆祕密藏，故稱為妙。

> Three‑dharmas subtlety refers to the combined three dharmas, the vertical three dharmas, the horizontal three dharmas, the neither‑vertical‑nor‑horizontal three dharmas, and the analogically‑pervasive three dharmas. All are the secret treasury—therefore it is called subtle.

感應妙者，謂四句感應、三十六句感應、二十五感應、別圓感應。水不上升、月不下降，一月一時普現眾水；諸佛不來、眾生不往，慈善根力見如此事，故名感應妙。

> Resonance subtlety refers to the four‑phrase resonances, the thirty‑six‑phrase resonances, the twenty‑five resonances, and the distinct and perfect resonances. Water does not rise; the moon does not descend; one moon at one time universally appears in all waters. The Buddhas do not come; sentient beings do not go; by the power of compassionate good roots one sees such things. Therefore it is called resonance subtlety.

神通妙者，謂報通、修通、作意通、體法通、無記化化通，無謀之權，稱緣轉變，若遠、若近、若種、若熟、若脫，皆為一乘，故言神通妙。

> Supernatural‑powers subtlety refers to karmic powers, cultivated powers, intentional powers, embodying‑dharma powers, and neutral transformation powers. It is the unplanned provisional, called transformation in accord with conditions: whether far or near, whether seed or ripe, whether liberated—all are for the One Vehicle. Therefore it is called supernatural‑powers subtlety.

說法妙者，謂說十二部法、小部法、大部法、逗緣法、所詮法、圓妙法，如理圓說，咸令眾生開、示、悟、入佛之知見，故言說法妙。

> Teaching‑the‑Dharma subtlety refers to teaching the twelve‑division dharmas, the small‑division dharmas, the great‑division dharmas, the condition‑matching dharmas, the expressed dharmas, and the perfect‑subtle dharmas. Teaching fully in accord with principle, it causes all sentient beings to open, reveal, awaken to, and enter the Buddha’s knowledge and vision. Therefore it is called teaching‑the‑Dharma subtlety.

眷屬妙者，謂業眷屬、神通眷屬、願眷屬、應眷屬、法門眷屬，如陰雲籠月，群臣豪族，前後圍遶，故言眷屬妙。

> Retinue subtlety refers to karmic retinue, supernatural‑power retinue, vow retinue, responsive retinue, and dharma‑gate retinue. Like overcast clouds enveloping the moon, like ministers and great clans surrounding in front and behind—therefore it is called retinue subtlety.

利益妙者，謂果益、因益、空益、假益、中益、變易益，猶如大海能受龍雨，故名利益妙。

> Merit‑and‑benefit subtlety refers to fruit benefit, cause benefit, emptiness benefit, provisional benefit, middle benefit, and transformation benefit. Like the great ocean able to receive dragon rain—therefore it is called merit‑and‑benefit subtlety.

○二引證者，但引迹文，尚不引本文，況引餘經耶。文云：「諸法如是相等，唯佛與佛乃能究盡諸法實相。」實相是佛智慧門，門即境也。又云：「甚深微妙法，難見難可了。我及十方佛，乃能知是相。」即境妙也。「我所得智慧，微妙最第一。」又以此妙慧，求無上道。「無漏不思議，甚深微妙法，唯我知是相。」(云云)即智妙也。「本從無數佛，具足行諸道，行此諸道已，道場得成果。」又云：「合掌以敬心，欲聞具足道。」又「諸法從本來，常自寂滅相，佛子行道已，來世得作佛。」即行妙。「天雨四華」表住、行、向、地。「開、示、悟、入」亦是位義。「乘是寶乘」遊於四方，四方是因位；「直至道場」是果位。是名位妙。「佛自住大乘，如其所得法，定慧力莊嚴。」大乘即真性，定即資成，慧即觀照，是為三法妙。「我於三七日中，思惟如是事。」又「我以佛眼觀，見六道眾生。」又「一切眾生，皆是吾子。」又「遙見其父，踞師子床。」即感應妙也。今佛世尊入于三昧，是不可思議，現希有事，神通妙也。如來能種種分別，巧說諸法，言辭柔軟，悅可眾心。身子云：「聞佛柔軟音，深遠甚微妙。」又其所說法，皆悉到於一切智地。又但說無上道。又已今當說，最為難信難解。即說法妙。「但教化菩薩」，無聲聞弟子。即眷屬妙。「現在、未來，若聞一句一偈，皆與三菩提記。」又「須臾聞者，即得究竟三菩提。」又「若以小乘化，我即墮慳貪，此事為不可。」又「終不令一人獨得滅度，皆以如來滅度而滅度之。」即利益妙也。

> Citing proof: only Trace passages are cited; Fundamental passages are not yet cited—how much less other sūtras. The text says: "The dharmas are suchness of mark and so on; only a Buddha and a Buddha can fully fathom the true mark of all dharmas." The true mark is the gate of the Buddha’s wisdom; the gate is precisely the realm. It also says: "The profoundly deep and subtle Dharma is hard to see and hard to understand. I and the Buddhas of the ten directions can know this mark." This is realm subtlety. "The wisdom I have attained is subtly wonderful and most supreme." And with this subtle wisdom, [one] seeks the unsurpassed path. "Outflow‑free and inconceivable, profoundly deep and subtle Dharma—only I know this mark" (and so on). This is wisdom subtlety. "From countless Buddhas from the beginning, fully practiced all paths; having practiced these paths, in the bodhi‑place one attains the fruits." It also says: "With palms joined in reverence, [they] wish to hear the complete path." And "All dharmas from the beginning are always of the mark of quiescent extinction; after the Buddha‑children practice the path, in future lives they will become Buddhas." This is practice subtlety. "Heaven rains four flowers" signifies abode, practice, dedication, and ground. "Open, reveal, awaken, enter" is also the meaning of position. "Riding this jeweled vehicle" travels to the four directions—the four directions are the cause‑position; "straight to the bodhi‑place" is the fruit‑position. This is called position subtlety. "The Buddha himself dwells in the Great Vehicle; the Dharma as he has attained is adorned by the powers of samādhi and wisdom." The Great Vehicle is true nature; samādhi is accumulation and completion; wisdom is contemplation and illumination—this is three‑dharmas subtlety. "For three seven‑day periods I pondered such matters." Again, "With the Buddha‑eye I observe and see the sentient beings of the six destinies." Again, "All sentient beings are all my children." Again, "From afar he sees his father, seated on a lion throne." This is resonance subtlety. Now the Buddha, the World‑Honored One, enters samādhi—this is inconceivable, manifesting rare events—this is supernatural‑powers subtlety. The Tathāgata can variously discriminate, skillfully teach the dharmas; his words are gentle, pleasing the hearts of the multitudes. Śāriputra says: "Hearing the Buddha’s gentle voice, it is deep, far‑reaching, and very subtle." Also, the dharmas he teaches all reach the ground of all‑knowledge. Also, he only speaks the unsurpassed path. Also, what has been and will now be taught is most difficult to believe and understand. This is teaching‑the‑Dharma subtlety. "Only teaching bodhisattvas," with no śrāvaka disciples—this is retinue subtlety. "In the present and the future, if one hears a single line or a single gāthā, all receive a prediction of three bodhi." Again, "Those who hear it even for a moment immediately obtain ultimate three bodhi." Again, "If I were to transform [beings] with the Small Vehicle, I would fall into stinginess and greed; this would be unacceptable." Again, "I will never let any single person attain extinction alone; all are extinguished by the Tathāgata’s extinction." This is merit‑and‑benefit subtlety.

## The Arising of the Ten Subtleties

○三生起者，實相之境，非佛天人所作，本自有之，非適今也，故最居初。

> **The arising [of the Ten Subtleties]:** The realm of True Reality is not made by Buddha, devas, or humans—it originally exists of itself; it is not [created] just now. Therefore it is placed first.

迷理故起惑，解理故生智。智為行本，因於智目，起於行足。目、足及境，三法為乘，乘於是乘，入清涼池，登於諸位。

> Due to confusion about principle, delusion arises; due to understanding principle, wisdom arises. Wisdom is the root of practice. Because of wisdom's eyes, practice's feet arise. Eyes, feet, and realm—these three dharmas become the vehicle. Riding on this vehicle, one enters the cool pond and ascends the various positions.

位何所住？住於三法祕密藏中。

> What do the positions abide in? They abide in the **secret treasury of the three dharmas**.

住是法已，寂而常照，照十法界機，機來必應。

> Having abided in this dharma, still yet always illuminating, illuminating the capacities of the ten Dharma-Realms—when capacity comes, there must be response.

若赴機垂應，先用身輪，神通駭發。見變通已，堪任受道，即以口輪，宣示開導。既霑法雨，稟教受道，成法眷屬。眷屬行行，拔生死本，開佛知見，得大利益。

> If responding to capacity and bestowing response, first using the body-wheel—supernatural powers startle and awaken. Having seen the transformations, [beings] are capable of receiving the Way. Then using the mouth-wheel, [the Buddha] proclaims and guides. Having been moistened by the Dharma rain, receiving teaching and the Way, they become Dharma retinue. The retinue practices practice, uprooting the root of birth-and-death, opening the Buddha's knowledge and vision, attaining great benefit.

前五約自，因果具足；後五約他，能所具足。法雖無量，十義意圓。自他始終，皆悉究竟也。

> **The first five [subtleties] are in terms of self—cause and fruit are complete. The last five are in terms of others—the able and what is enabled are complete.** Though the dharmas are immeasurable, the meaning of the ten is complete. Self and other, beginning and end—all are exhaustively complete.

## Footnotes

[^1]: **Half-word** (半字) refers to the Hīnayāna teaching of impermanence and suffering; **full-word** (滿字) refers to the Mahāyāna teaching of Buddha-nature and permanence. This terminology comes from the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*.

[^2]: The simile of the **foolish dog and clever lion** is famous in Tiantai and Chan: a foolish dog chases thrown objects endlessly; a clever lion attacks the thrower, ending the game. Similarly, one must address the source of conceptual proliferation, not chase concepts.

[^3]: The **three grasses** and **two trees** refer to the famous *Lotus Sūtra* parable (Chapter 5) of the rain falling equally on all plants, which grow according to their nature—symbolizing the various capacities of beings receiving the one Dharma rain differently.
