### Why Retinue After Dharma-Exposition

若無說而已，說必被緣，緣即受道人也。已受道故，即成眷屬。

> If there were no teaching, that would be one thing. **If there is teaching, it must reach those with affinity**—those with affinity are Dharma-receivers. **Having received the Dharma, they become retinue**.

譬如父母遺體，攬此成身，得為天性。天性親愛，故名眷；更相臣順，故名屬。

> Like parents' legacy-body—grasping this, one forms a body, becoming natural kinship. **Natural kinship's loving connection is called "kin" (眷); mutually serving and following is called "belonging" (屬)**.

---

### How Retinue Forms

行者亦爾，受戒之時，說此戒法，授於前人，前人聽聞，即得發戒，師、弟所由生也。

> Practitioners are the same. At the time of receiving precepts, this precept-dharma is explained and transmitted to the person before [the teacher]; hearing it, [the student] develops precepts—**this is how teacher and disciple arise**.

禪亦如是，授安心法，如教修行，即得發定，是為我師，我是弟子。

> Dhyāna is also like this: transmitting the mind-settling method, cultivating as taught, one develops samādhi—**"this is my teacher; I am the disciple."**

慧亦如是，說諸法門，轉入人心，由法成親。親故則信，信故則順，是名眷屬也。

> Wisdom is also like this: explaining the dharma-gates, [they] turn and enter the person's mind—**through Dharma, kinship is established**. Kinship leads to faith; faith leads to following—this is called retinue.

## Five Types of Retinue

二、明眷屬者，又為五種：

> Explaining retinue has **five types**:

| # | Type | Description |
|---|------|-------------|
| 1 | **Principle-nature** (理性眷屬) | Inherent Buddha-nature connection |
| 2 | **Karma-born** (業生眷屬) | Connection through shared karma |
| 3 | **Vow-born** (願生眷屬) | Connection through vows |
| 4 | **Supernatural-born** (神通生眷屬) | Connection through spiritual powers |
| 5 | **Response-born** (應生眷屬) | Connection through compassionate manifestation |

---

### 1. Principle-Nature Retinue

理性眷屬者，眾生如佛如，一如無二如，理性相關，任運是子。

> **Principle-nature retinue**: Sentient beings' suchness is Buddha's suchness; **one suchness, no second suchness**; principle-nature mutually connects—**naturally they are children**.

故云：「我亦如是，眾聖中尊，世間之父。一切眾生，皆是吾子。」

> Hence it says: "**I am also like this—honored among sages, father of the world. All sentient beings are my children.**"

此是理性，不關結緣、不結緣，皆是佛子也。

> This is principle-nature—**whether having established affinity or not, all are Buddha's children**.

---

### 2. Karma-Born Retinue

業生眷屬者，但眾生理論皆子，而飲他毒藥，有失心者、不失心者。

> **Karma-born retinue**: Though in principle all beings are children, they've drunk others' poison—**some have lost their minds, some haven't**.

不失心者，拜跪問訊，求索救護，與藥即服...

> Those who haven't lost their minds bow, inquire, seek protection—given medicine, they take it...

其失心者，雖與良藥而不肯服，流浪生死，逃逝他國。

> Those who have lost their minds—**though given good medicine, they won't take it**, wandering in birth-and-death, fleeing to other countries.

---

### 3. Vow-Born Retinue

願眷屬者，先世結緣，雖未斷苦，願生內眷屬中...

> **Vow-born retinue**: Past lives established affinity; though suffering not yet cut, **vowing to be born among inner retinue**...

---

### 4. Supernatural-Born Retinue

神通眷屬者，若先世值佛，發真見諦，生猶未盡，或在上界，或在他方...

> **Supernatural-born retinue**: If in past lives one met Buddha, developed true seeing of truth, but births not yet exhausted—whether in higher realms or other directions...

以通力分形來此...為親、中、怨，輔佛行化...

> Using supernatural power to divide one's form and come here... **being kin, neutral, or enemy—assisting Buddha's transformative teaching**...

---

### 5. Response-Born Retinue

法身惑除理顯，何故受生？應身受生，其意有三：一為熟他。二為自熟。三為本緣。

> Dharma-body—delusion removed, principle revealed—why take birth? **Response-body taking birth has three meanings**:
> 1. **For ripening others**
> 2. **For ripening oneself**
> 3. **For original affinities**

## The Secret of the *Lotus Sūtra*'s Retinue

當知，諸眷屬非生死人。摩耶是千佛之母，淨飯是千佛之父，羅睺羅千佛之子。諸聲聞等，悉內祕外現，示眾有三毒，實自淨佛土...

> Know that **these retinue are not birth-and-death beings**. Māyā is mother of a thousand Buddhas; Śuddhodana is father of a thousand Buddhas; Rāhula is son of a thousand Buddhas. **All the śrāvakas secretly hide inside while manifesting outside**—showing they have the three poisons while **actually purifying Buddha-lands**...

諸親族等，皆是大權法身上地。豈有凡夫，能懷那羅延菩薩耶？

> All kinfolk are **great expedient Dharma-body higher-ground [bodhisattvas]**. Could an ordinary being carry the Nārāyaṇa bodhisattva [in the womb]?

---

## Even Enemies Are Dharma-Body Manifestations

調達是賓伽羅菩薩，先世大善知識。阿闍世是不動菩薩。薩遮尼犍是大方便菩薩。波旬是住不思議解脫。

> **Devadatta is Siṃhavikrīḍita bodhisattva**—a great spiritual friend from past lives. **Ajātaśatru is Akṣobhya bodhisattva**. **Saccanigaṇṭha is Great Skillful Means bodhisattva**. **Māra is one dwelling in Inconceivable Liberation**.

故《華嚴》列眾，明諸天、龍、鬼神悉住不可思議法門。

> Hence the *Avataṃsaka*'s assembly lists make clear that all gods, dragons, ghosts, and spirits **dwell in inconceivable dharma-gates**.

---

## Coarse and Subtle Retinue

若三藏根性眷屬，此性下劣...皆麁眷屬也。

> If Tripiṭaka root-nature retinue—this nature is inferior... all are **coarse retinue**.

今《法華》定天性審父子，非復客作，故常不輕深得此意，知一切眾生正因不滅，不敢輕慢。

> Now the *Lotus* **definitively establishes natural kinship, examining father and children**—no longer guest-laborers. Hence **Never-Disparaging** deeply grasped this meaning: knowing all sentient beings' right-cause is indestructible, **he dared not slight them**.

---

## Footnotes

[^1]: The **Five Types of Retinue** reveal the full scope of spiritual connection. Most remarkable is the teaching that even enemies and persecutors may be Dharma-body manifestations helping beings through "reverse methods."
