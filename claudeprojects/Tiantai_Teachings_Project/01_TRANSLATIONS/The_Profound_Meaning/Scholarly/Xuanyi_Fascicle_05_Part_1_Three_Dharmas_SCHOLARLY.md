# The Fifth [Subtlety]: Three Dharmas Subtlety

---

### Overview

斯乃妙位所住之法也。言三法者，即三軌也。軌名軌範，還是三法可軌範耳。

> **This is the dharma in which the subtle positions abide.** The term "Three Dharmas" means the **Three Tracks** (三軌). "Track" means pattern or standard—these three dharmas can serve as patterns.

此即七意：一、總明三軌。二、歷別明三軌。三、判麁妙。四、開麁顯妙。五、明始終。六、類三法。七、悉檀料簡。

> This has **seven topics**:
> 1. General explanation of the Three Tracks
> 2. Specific explanation of the Three Tracks
> 3. Judging coarse and subtle
> 4. Opening coarse to reveal subtle
> 5. Explaining beginning and end
> 6. Classifying the Three Dharmas
> 7. Four Siddhānta analysis

## 一、總明三軌
# Part 1: General Explanation of the Three Tracks

---

一、真性軌。二、觀照軌。三、資成軌。名雖有三，秖是一大乘法也。

> 1. **True Nature Track** (真性軌)
> 2. **Contemplative Illumination Track** (觀照軌)
> 3. **Resource Accomplishment Track** (資成軌)

> Though the names are three, **they are only the one Great Vehicle dharma**.

---

### The Three Names for the One Vehicle

經曰：「十方諦求，更無餘乘，唯一佛乘」。一佛乘即具三法，亦名第一義諦，亦名第一義空，亦名如來藏。

> The sūtra says: "Seeking in the ten directions, there is no other vehicle—**only the One Buddha Vehicle**." The One Buddha Vehicle contains these three dharmas:
> - Also named **Ultimate Truth** (第一義諦)
> - Also named **Ultimate Emptiness** (第一義空)
> - Also named **Tathāgatagarbha** (如來藏)

---

### Not Three, Not One

此三不定三，三而論一。一不定一，一而論三，不可思議，不並不別，伊字、天目。

> **These three are not definitely three**—discussing three, we speak of one. **One is not definitely one**—discussing one, we speak of three. Inconceivable, neither parallel nor separate—like the **three dots of the *i* character** (伊字) or the **heavenly eye** (天目).

故《大經》云：「佛性者，亦一、非一、非一非非一。亦一者，一切眾生悉一乘故。」此語第一義諦。「非一者，如是數法故。」此語如來藏。「非一非非一，數、非數法，不決定故。」此語第一義空。

> Hence the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "Buddha-nature is '**also one, non-one, neither-one-nor-non-one**.'
> - 'Also one' means all sentient beings are entirely One Vehicle"—this refers to **Ultimate Truth**.
> - "'Non-one' means such enumerable dharmas"—this refers to **Tathāgatagarbha**.
> - "'Neither-one-nor-non-one' means enumerable and non-enumerable dharmas are not fixed"—this refers to **Ultimate Emptiness**.

---

### Correspondence with Previous Subtleties

前明諸諦，若開、若合，若麁、若妙等，已是真性軌相也。前明諸智，若開、若合，若麁、若妙，是觀照軌相也。前明諸行，若開、若合，若麁、若妙，已是資成軌相也。

> **Previous [discussions of] all truths—opening or closing, coarse or subtle—are already the mark of the True Nature Track.**
> **Previous [discussions of] all wisdoms—opening or closing, coarse or subtle—are the mark of the Contemplative Illumination Track.**
> **Previous [discussions of] all practices—opening or closing, coarse or subtle—are already the mark of the Resource Accomplishment Track.**

前明諸位，秖是修此三法所證之果耳。

> **Previous [discussions of] all positions are simply the fruits attained from cultivating these three dharmas.**

## 四、明圓教三法
# Part 4: The Perfect Teaching's Three Dharmas

---

以真性軌為乘體。不偽名真，不改名性，即正因常住，諸佛所師，謂此法也。

> **Taking the True Nature Track as the vehicle-body.** "Not false" is called "true"; "not changing" is called "nature." This is the **constant-abiding right cause**—what all Buddhas take as teacher—this is that dharma.

一切眾生亦悉一乘，眾生即涅槃相，不可復滅；涅槃即生死，無滅不生。

> All sentient beings are also entirely One Vehicle. **Sentient beings are precisely the mark of nirvāṇa**—there is nothing more to extinguish. **Nirvāṇa is precisely birth-and-death**—no extinction, no arising.

故《大品》云：「是乘不動、不出。」即此乘也。

> Hence the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā* says: "**This vehicle neither moves nor exits.**" This is that vehicle.

---

### Contemplative Illumination Track

觀照者，秖點真性，寂而常照，便是觀照，即是第一義空。

> **Contemplative Illumination**: simply pointing to true nature, quiescent yet constantly illuminating—this is Contemplative Illumination, which is **Ultimate Emptiness**.

---

### Resource Accomplishment Track

資成者，秖點真性法界，含藏諸行，無量眾具，即如來藏。

> **Resource Accomplishment**: simply pointing to the true-nature Dharma-realm, containing and storing all practices, immeasurable implements—this is **Tathāgatagarbha**.

---

### The Wish-Fulfilling Jewel

三法不一異，如點如意珠中論光、論寶，光、寶不與珠一，不與珠異，不縱不橫。三法亦如是，亦一、亦非一，亦非一非非一，不可思議之三法也。

> **The three dharmas are neither one nor different.** Like pointing to a wish-fulfilling jewel and discussing its light and treasure—light and treasure are not one with the jewel, not different from the jewel, **not vertical, not horizontal**. The three dharmas are also thus: also one, also non-one, also neither-one-nor-non-one—**inconceivable three dharmas**.

---

### The Three Obstacles

若迷此三法，即成三障：

> **If one is confused about these three dharmas, they become the three obstacles:**

| Dharma Confused | Obstacle | What It Blocks |
|-----------------|----------|----------------|
| Tathāgatagarbha | Dust-and-sand (塵沙) | Innumerable dharma-gates |
| Ultimate Emptiness | View-and-thought (見思) | Liberation |
| Ultimate Truth | Root Ignorance (無明) | Buddha-nature realization |

---

### Revealing the Three Dharmas

若即塵沙障達無量法門者，即資成軌得顯。若即見思障達第一義空者，觀照軌得顯。若即無明障達第一義諦者，真性軌得顯。

> If through dust-and-sand obstacles one comprehends innumerable dharma-gates—**Resource Accomplishment Track is revealed**.
> If through view-and-thought obstacles one comprehends Ultimate Emptiness—**Contemplative Illumination Track is revealed**.
> If through root ignorance obstacle one comprehends Ultimate Truth—**True Nature Track is revealed**.

真性軌得顯，名為法身。觀照得顯，名為般若。資成得顯，名為解脫。

> **True Nature Track revealed is called Dharma-body.**
> **Contemplative Illumination revealed is called Prajñā.**
> **Resource Accomplishment revealed is called Liberation.**

此兩即是定慧莊嚴，莊嚴法身。法身是乘體，定慧是眾具。

> These two are concentration-and-wisdom adornments, adorning the Dharma-body. **Dharma-body is the vehicle-body; concentration-and-wisdom are the implements.**

---

## 六、類三法 — Ten Classifications of Three Dharmas

六、類通三法者...類通諸三法。何者？赴緣名異，得意義同，粗通十條，餘者可領。

> Classifying and penetrating the Three Dharmas... What are they? **Meeting conditions, names differ; grasping the meaning, the significance is the same.** Roughly penetrating ten categories, the rest can be understood.

---

### The Ten Three-Dharmas

| # | Category | True Nature | Contemplative Illumination | Resource Accomplishment |
|---|----------|-------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | **Three Paths** (三道) | Suffering Path | Affliction Path | Karma Path |
| 2 | **Three Consciousnesses** (三識) | Amala | Ālaya | Ādāna |
| 3 | **Three Buddha-Natures** (三佛性) | Right Cause | Understanding Cause | Condition Cause |
| 4 | **Three Prajñās** (三般若) | Reality-mark | Contemplative | Literary |
| 5 | **Three Bodhis** (三菩提) | Reality-mark | Real-wisdom | Skillful-means |
| 6 | **Three Great Vehicles** (三大乘) | Principle Vehicle | Following Vehicle | Attainment Vehicle |
| 7 | **Three Bodies** (三身) | Dharma-body | Reward-body | Response-body |
| 8 | **Three Nirvāṇas** (三涅槃) | Nature-Purity | Perfect-Purity | Skillful-Purity |
| 9 | **One-Essence Three Jewels** (一體三寶) | Dharma | Buddha | Sangha |
| 10 | **Three Virtues** (三德) | Dharma-body | Prajñā | Liberation |

---

### Type-Penetrating the Three Paths

三道即三軌。苦道即真性者，下文云：「世間相常住」，豈不即彼生死而是法身耶？

> The Three Paths are the Three Tracks. **Suffering Path is True Nature**: the text below says "worldly marks are eternally abiding"—is not birth-and-death precisely Dharma-body?

煩惱即觀照，觀照本照惑，無惑則無照...即煩惱是觀照也。

> **Affliction is Contemplative Illumination**: contemplative illumination fundamentally illuminates delusion; without delusion, there is no illumination... thus affliction is contemplative illumination.

資成即業道者，惡是善資，無惡亦無善。

> **Resource Accomplishment is Karma Path**: evil is the resource for good; without evil, there is no good either.

---

### Type-Penetrating the Three Buddha-Natures

三佛性者，真性軌即是正因性；觀照軌即是了因性；資成軌即是緣因性。

> **Three Buddha-Natures**: True Nature Track is **Right-Cause Nature**; Contemplative Illumination Track is **Understanding-Cause Nature**; Resource Accomplishment Track is **Condition-Cause Nature**.

故下文云：「汝實我子；我實汝父。」即正因性。

> Hence the text below says: "**You are truly my children; I am truly your father**"—this is Right-Cause Nature.

又云：「我昔教汝無上道故，一切智願猶在不失。」智即了因性，願即緣因性。

> Also: "Because I formerly taught you the unsurpassed path, **your all-knowledge vow still remains, not lost**." Wisdom is Understanding-Cause Nature; vow is Condition-Cause Nature.

---

### Type-Penetrating the Three Virtues

十、類通三德者，《大經》三德，共成大涅槃。此經三軌，共成大乘。

> Type-penetrating the **Three Virtues**: The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*'s Three Virtues together complete Great Nirvāṇa. This sūtra's Three Tracks together complete the Great Vehicle.

彼明法身德，此云實相。彼處明般若德；此經明其智慧門難解難入。彼經明解脫德；此經明數數示現...

> That [sūtra] clarifies Dharma-body virtue; this says Reality-mark. That clarifies Prajñā virtue; this sūtra clarifies that the wisdom-gate is difficult to understand, difficult to enter. That sūtra clarifies Liberation virtue; this sūtra clarifies repeated manifestation...

---

## Summary: The Architecture of Three Dharmas

| Track | Source | Obstacle | Virtue | Body |
|-------|--------|----------|--------|------|
| **True Nature** | Ultimate Truth | Root Ignorance | Dharma-body | Dharma-body |
| **Contemplative Illumination** | Ultimate Emptiness | View-and-Thought | Prajñā | Reward-body |
| **Resource Accomplishment** | Tathāgatagarbha | Dust-and-Sand | Liberation | Response-body |

---

## Footnotes

[^1]: The **Three Tracks** (三軌) represent Master Zhiyi's synthesis of the entire Buddha-dharma into three interpenetrating aspects. They correspond to: the reality that is realized (True Nature), the wisdom that realizes (Contemplative Illumination), and the practice that enables realization (Resource Accomplishment). These three are neither one nor different—like the light and treasure of a wish-fulfilling jewel.
