○第五、三法妙者，斯乃妙位所住之法也。言三法者，即三軌也。軌名軌範，還是三法可軌範耳。此即七意：一、總明三軌。二、歷別明三軌。三、判麁妙。四、開麁顯妙。五、明始終。六、類三法。七、悉檀料簡。

> The fifth, Three Dharmas Subtlety: this is the dharma in which the subtle positions abide. To speak of three dharmas is precisely the three tracks. "Track" is named pattern and norm; it is that these three dharmas can serve as patterns. This has seven topics: (1) generally clarifying the three tracks; (2) sequentially distinguishing the three tracks; (3) judging coarse and subtle; (4) opening the coarse to reveal the subtle; (5) clarifying beginning and end; (6) classifying the three dharmas; (7) siddhānta analysis and discrimination.

一、總明三軌者：一、真性軌。二、觀照軌。三、資成軌。名雖有三，秖是一大乘法也。經曰：「十方諦求，更無餘乘，唯一佛乘」。一佛乘即具三法，亦名第一義諦，亦名第一義空，亦名如來藏。此三不定三，三而論一。一不定一，一而論三，不可思議，不並不別，伊字、天目。故《大經》云：「佛性者，亦一、非一、非一非非一。亦一者，一切眾生悉一乘故。」此語第一義諦。「非一者，如是數法故。」此語如來藏。「非一非非一，數、非數法，不決定故。」此語第一義空。而皆稱亦者，鄭重也。秖是一法，亦名三耳。故不可單取，不可複取，不縱不橫，而三而一。

> First, generally clarifying the three tracks: (1) the True Nature Track; (2) the Contemplative Illumination Track; (3) the Resource Accomplishment Track. Though the names are three, it is only one Mahāyāna dharma. The sūtra says: "Seeking in the ten directions, there is no other vehicle, only the One Buddha Vehicle." The One Buddha Vehicle is precisely endowed with three dharmas, also named Ultimate Truth, also named Ultimate Emptiness, also named Tathāgatagarbha. These three are not fixed as three; speaking of three, one speaks of one. One is not fixed as one; speaking of one, one speaks of three—an inconceivable [unity], neither parallel nor separate, like the i‑character or the heavenly eye. Therefore the *Great Sutra* says: "Buddha‑nature is also one, not one, not one and not not‑one. 'Also one' means all sentient beings are entirely one vehicle." This statement is Ultimate Truth. "Not one" means there are such enumerable dharmas; this statement is Tathāgatagarbha. "Not one and not not‑one" means enumerable and non‑enumerable dharmas are not fixed; this statement is Ultimate Emptiness. That all are called "also" is for emphasis. It is only one dharma, also named three. Therefore it cannot be taken singly, cannot be taken repeatedly, neither vertical nor horizontal, and is three yet one.

前明諸諦，若開、若合，若麁、若妙等，已是真性軌相也。前明諸智，若開、若合，若麁、若妙，是觀照軌相也。前明諸行，若開、若合，若麁、若妙，已是資成軌相也。前明諸位，秖是修此三法所證之果耳。若然，何以重說？重說有三義：一者、前境、智、行，是因中所乘之三軌。今明乘是大乘，已至道場，證果所住之三軌也。二者、前作境、智等名別說，今作法名合說。三者、前直爾散說，不論本末。今遠論其本，即是性德三軌，亦名如來之藏；極論其末，即是修德三軌，亦名祕密藏。本末含藏一切諸法。從性德之三法，起名字之三法；因名字之三法，修觀行之三法；因觀行之三法，發相似之三法；乃至分證之三法，究竟之三法。自成三法化他三法，為是義故，宜應重說也。

> Previously clarifying the various truths—whether opened or combined, coarse or subtle, and so forth—are already the marks of the True Nature Track. Previously clarifying the various wisdoms—whether opened or combined, coarse or subtle—are the marks of the Contemplative Illumination Track. Previously clarifying the various practices—whether opened or combined, coarse or subtle—are already the marks of the Resource Accomplishment Track. Previously clarifying the various positions are only the fruits attained from cultivating these three dharmas. If so, why repeat it? Repetition has three meanings: first, the previous realms, wisdom, and practices are the three tracks ridden within the cause; now clarifying the vehicle is the Mahāyāna, already reaching the bodhimaṇḍa, the three tracks in which the fruit attained abides. Second, previously the realms, wisdom, and so forth were spoken separately by name; now they are spoken together under the name "dharmas." Third, previously it was spoken only scatteredly, not discussing root and end. Now we discuss its root at a distance: it is the three tracks of inherent virtue, also named the Tathāgata’s store; and we discuss its end to the utmost: it is the three tracks of cultivated virtue, also named the secret store. Root and end contain all dharmas. From the three dharmas of inherent virtue arise the three dharmas of names; from the three dharmas of names one cultivates the three dharmas of contemplation and practice; from the three dharmas of contemplation and practice one brings forth the three dharmas of resemblance; up to the three dharmas of partial realization and the three dharmas of ultimate realization. To accomplish the three dharmas for oneself and transform others by the three dharmas—because of this meaning, it is appropriate to repeat.

私謂一句即三句，三句即一句，名圓佛乘。記中既從如來藏一句出諸方便，此乃別判，例應通開。非一者，數法故。指此為如來藏，開出三藏中三乘事相方便。非一非非一，不決定故。指此一句，為第一義空，開出通教三人即事而真。亦一者，一切眾生悉一乘故。指此一句，為第一義諦，開出別教獨菩薩乘。此諸方便，悉從圓出。故經言：「於一佛乘，分別說三。」即此義也。

> I privately say that one sentence is exactly three sentences, and three sentences are exactly one sentence, named the Perfect Buddha Vehicle. In the commentary, since from the single sentence "Tathāgatagarbha" the various expedients are produced, this is a separate judgment; by analogy it should be opened universally. "Not one" means enumerable dharmas. Pointing to this as Tathāgatagarbha, it opens the three vehicles of the Tripiṭaka in terms of phenomena and expedients. "Not one and not not‑one" means not fixed; pointing to this one sentence as Ultimate Emptiness, it opens the Common Teaching’s three persons who are true in relation to phenomena. "Also one" means all sentient beings are entirely one vehicle; pointing to this one sentence as Ultimate Truth, it opens the Distinct Teaching’s sole bodhisattva vehicle. All these expedients come from the Perfect. Therefore the sūtra says: "Within the One Buddha Vehicle, it discriminates and speaks three." This is precisely the meaning.

二、歷別明三法者，先須識如來開、合方便，然後乃解總攬三法為一大乘也。佛從何法開諸權乘？如《大經》明佛性非一，如是數法，說三乘故。當知，諸乘數法，為如來藏所攝。佛於此藏，開出聲聞、緣覺，及諸菩薩通、別等乘。何者？諸乘既是方便，如來藏又是事，從事出方便，故言諸權為如來藏攝耳。又依經故，《大經》云：「聲聞僧者，名有為僧。」又云：「六波羅蜜福德莊嚴。」又云：「聲聞之人，定力多故，不見佛性。」當知，定力即是福德，福德秖是有為。《勝鬘》稱為有漏。例如：界內見、思未破，為有起作，故名有為；取理不當，故名有漏；非智慧法，故名福德。今以下望上，亦應如是。二乘未破變易，猶是有為；無明未脫，故言有漏；非中道智，故名福德。以是故知，方便諸乘悉為資成所攝，皆從大乘一句偏出，非究竟法，故云「於一佛乘，分別說三。」即此意也。亦是於一佛乘，分別說五；亦是分別說七；亦是分別說九。若依此釋，如來藏句，開出種種方便、諸權乘法也。

> Second, sequentially distinguishing the three dharmas: first one must know the Tathāgata’s opening and combining expedients, and only then understand that the three dharmas are comprehended as one Mahāyāna. From what dharma does the Buddha open the various provisional vehicles? As the *Great Sutra* clarifies that Buddha‑nature is not one, there are such enumerable dharmas; therefore it speaks of the three vehicles. You should know that the enumerable dharmas of the various vehicles are encompassed by the Tathāgatagarbha. The Buddha, from this store, opens out the Śrāvaka, Pratyekabuddha, and the bodhisattva common and distinct vehicles. Why? The various vehicles are expedients, and the Tathāgatagarbha is also the matter; from the matter come expedients, thus it is said that the various provisional vehicles are encompassed by the Tathāgatagarbha. Again relying on the sūtra, the *Great Sutra* says: "The Śrāvaka saṃgha is named the conditioned saṃgha." It also says: "The six pāramitās are meritorious adornment." It also says: "Śrāvakas, because their concentration power is great, do not see Buddha‑nature." You should know that concentration power is meritorious virtue, and meritorious virtue is only conditioned. The *Śrīmālā* calls this "contaminated." For example, when within the realm view and thought are not yet broken, there are arising actions, therefore it is called conditioned; grasping principle improperly, therefore it is called contaminated; not a wisdom dharma, therefore it is called meritorious virtue. Now, looking from below to above, it should also be thus. The two vehicles have not broken transformation birth‑and‑death, so they are still conditioned; ignorance is not yet removed, therefore it is called contaminated; it is not middle‑way wisdom, therefore it is called meritorious virtue. From this it is known that the expedient vehicles are all encompassed by Resource Accomplishment; all come partially out from a single sentence of the Mahāyāna, not the ultimate dharma, therefore it says "Within the One Buddha Vehicle, it discriminates and speaks three." This is the intent. It is also "within the One Buddha Vehicle, discriminating to speak five"; also discriminating to speak seven; also discriminating to speak nine. If explained in this way, the Tathāgatagarbha sentence opens out various expedients and the various provisional‑vehicle dharmas.

次、歷四教各論三法者，三藏中，以無為智慧，名觀照軌。正為乘體，助道成乘具，名資成軌。正、助之乘，斷惑入真，真是真性軌。教來詮此，故以教為乘也。緣覺亦爾，菩薩以無常觀為觀照；功德肥為資成；坐道場斷結、見真為真性。此教詮真，乘是教乘，從三界中出，到薩婆若中住，言教已盡，故無教乘。真不能運，故證非乘，故有索車之意(云云)。

> Next, in the four teachings, each discusses the three dharmas. In the Tripiṭaka teaching, unconditioned wisdom is named the Contemplative Illumination Track. The proper [path] is the vehicle body; the assisting path becomes the vehicle implements, named the Resource Accomplishment Track. The vehicle of proper and assisting cuts afflictions and enters truth; truth is the True Nature Track. The teaching comes to express this, therefore the teaching is taken as the vehicle. The pratyekabuddha is likewise; the bodhisattva takes contemplation of impermanence as contemplative illumination; abundant merits as resource accomplishment; sitting at the bodhimaṇḍa, cutting bonds and seeing truth as true nature. This teaching expresses truth; the vehicle is the teaching‑vehicle. It goes out from the three realms and dwells in sarvajña; when the teaching is already exhausted, therefore there is no teaching‑vehicle. Truth cannot transport; therefore realization is not a vehicle; therefore there is the meaning of seeking the cart (and so on).

二、通教，以真性軌為乘體。何以故？即色是空，事中有理，此理即真，故為乘體。以即空慧為觀照，眾行為資成。此教詮真，乘是教乘，從三界出，到薩婆若中住。菩薩出三界已，用行為乘，淨佛國土，教化眾生，乃至道場，乃可名住。亦是有教無人。無誰住者，亦是教謝證寂，無復運義，亦有索車之意(云云)。

> Second, the Common Teaching: taking the True Nature Track as the vehicle body. Why? Because form is precisely emptiness; within phenomena there is principle; this principle is truth, therefore it is the vehicle body. Taking wisdom of emptiness as contemplative illumination; the various practices as resource accomplishment. This teaching expresses truth; the vehicle is the teaching‑vehicle. It exits the three realms and dwells in sarvajña. After the bodhisattva exits the three realms, using practice as the vehicle, he purifies Buddha‑lands and teaches sentient beings, up to the bodhimaṇḍa, then can be called dwelling. This is also having teaching but no person. There is no one who dwells; this is also that the teaching declines and one realizes quiescence, with no further meaning of transport; there is also the meaning of seeking the cart (and so on).

三、明別教三法者，以緣修觀照為乘體，諸行是資成，以此二法為緣修智慧。慧能破惑顯理，理不能破惑，理若破惑，一切眾生悉具理性，何故不破？若得此慧，則能破惑，故用智為乘體。故《大經》云：「無為無漏，名菩薩僧。即是一地、二地，乃至十地智慧，名智慧莊嚴。」以此智慧運通十地，故為乘體。然《攝大乘》明三種乘：理乘、隨乘、得乘。理者，即是道前真如。隨者，即是觀真如，慧隨順於境。得者，一切行願熏習，熏無分別智，契無分別境，與真如相應。此三意，一往乃同於三軌，而前後未融。何者？九識是道後真如，真如無事，智行根本種子皆在梨耶識中熏習成就，得無分別智光，成真實性。是則理乘本有，隨得今有，道後真如方能化物。此豈非縱義？若三乘悉為黎耶所攝，又是橫義，又濫冥初生覺。既縱既橫，與真伊相乖。元夫如來初出，便欲說實；為不堪者，先以無常遣倒，次用空淨蕩著，次用歷別起心，然後方明常樂我淨。龍樹作論，申佛此意，以不可得空洗蕩封著，習應一切法空，是名與般若相應。此空豈不空於無明？無明若空，種子安在？淨諸法已，點空說法，結四句相。此語虛玄，亦無住著。如病除已，乃可進食，食亦消化。那得發頭據阿黎耶出一切法？本之見慢，全自未降，封此新文，若長氷添水。故知，彼論非逗末代重著眾生，乃是界外一途法門耳。又，阿黎耶若具一切法者，那得不具道後真如？若言具者，那言真如非第八識？恐此猶是方便，從如來藏中開出耳。若執方便，巨妨真實。若是實者，執之又成語見，多含兒蘇，恐將夭命(云云)。若能善解破立之意，於諸經論，淨無滯著也。

> Third, clarifying the Distinct Teaching’s three dharmas: taking conditioned cultivation of contemplative illumination as the vehicle body; the various practices are resource accomplishment; using these two dharmas as conditions to cultivate wisdom. Wisdom can break delusion and reveal principle; principle cannot break delusion. If principle could break delusion, all sentient beings possess principle‑nature—why would they not break? If one obtains this wisdom, then one can break delusion; therefore wisdom is used as the vehicle body. Thus the *Great Sutra* says: "Unconditioned and outflow‑free is named the bodhisattva saṃgha. That is the wisdom of the first ground, second ground, up to the tenth ground, named wisdom adornment." Using this wisdom to transport through the ten grounds, therefore it is the vehicle body. However, the *Mahāyānasaṃgraha* clarifies three kinds of vehicles: the principle vehicle, the following vehicle, and the attained vehicle. The principle is the suchness before the path. The following is contemplation of suchness, with wisdom following along with the realm. The attained is that all practices and vows are perfumed and cultivate the non‑discriminating wisdom, accord with the non‑discriminating realm, and correspond with suchness. These three meanings, in one pass, are the same as the three tracks, yet the before‑and‑after are not fused. Why? The nine consciousnesses are the suchness after the path; suchness has no activity. The root seeds of wisdom and practice are all perfumed and completed within the ālaya‑consciousness, obtaining the light of non‑discriminating wisdom, and becoming true reality. This is that the principle vehicle is originally present, the following and attained are present now, and the suchness after the path is then able to transform beings. Is this not the meaning of vertical? If the three vehicles are all encompassed by the ālaya, then it is the meaning of horizontal, and also confounds obscurely the initial arising of enlightenment. Both vertical and horizontal, it conflicts with the true i‑mark. Originally, when the Tathāgata first emerged, he wished to speak the real; for those who could not bear it, he first used impermanence to dispel inversion, next used emptiness and purity to wash away attachment, next used sequential distinctions to arouse the mind, and only afterward clarified permanence, bliss, self, and purity. Nāgārjuna composed treatises to expound the Buddha’s meaning: using the emptiness that cannot be obtained to wash away clinging; habituating to the emptiness of all dharmas—this is named corresponding with prajñā. Would this emptiness not be empty of ignorance? If ignorance is empty, where are the seeds? After purifying all dharmas, he points to emptiness and speaks dharma, tying the four‑proposition marks. These words are empty and abstruse and also without abiding attachment. Like when illness is removed, then one may take food, and the food is also digested. How could one, from the outset, rely on the ālaya to produce all dharmas? The basis is views and pride, wholly not yet subdued; sealing this new text is like adding water to long ice. Therefore we know that that treatise does not accord with end‑age beings of heavy attachment; it is only one gate of dharma outside the realm. Further, if the ālaya contains all dharmas, how could it not contain the suchness after the path? If one says it contains [it], then how can one say suchness is not the eighth consciousness? I fear this is still expedient, opened out from the Tathāgatagarbha. If one clings to expedients, it greatly obstructs the real. If it is real, clinging to it becomes a view of words; too much gives infants milk, and one fears a short life (and so on). If one can well understand the meaning of breaking and establishing, among the sutras and treatises one will be pure and without obstruction.

四、明圓教三法者，以真性軌為乘體。不偽名真，不改名性，即正因常住，諸佛所師，謂此法也。一切眾生亦悉一乘，眾生即涅槃相，不可復滅；涅槃即生死，無滅不生。故《大品》云：「是乘不動、不出。」即此乘也。

> Fourth, clarifying the Perfect Teaching’s three dharmas: taking the True Nature Track as the vehicle body. Not false is called true; not changing is called nature; this is the constant‑abiding right cause, what all Buddhas take as teacher—this dharma. All sentient beings are also entirely one vehicle; sentient beings are precisely the mark of nirvāṇa, not to be extinguished again; nirvāṇa is precisely birth‑and‑death, with no extinction and no arising. Therefore the *Great Prajñā* says: "This vehicle does not move, does not exit." This is that vehicle.

觀照者，秖點真性，寂而常照，便是觀照，即是第一義空。資成者，秖點真性法界，含藏諸行，無量眾具，即如來藏。三法不一異，如點如意珠中論光、論寶，光、寶不與珠一，不與珠異，不縱不橫。三法亦如是，亦一、亦非一，亦非一非非一，不可思議之三法也。若迷此三法，即成三障：一者、界內、界外塵沙，障如來藏。二者、通別見思，障第一義空。三者、根本無明，障第一義理。若即塵沙障達無量法門者，即資成軌得顯。若即見思障達第一義空者，觀照軌得顯。若即無明障達第一義諦者，真性軌得顯。真性軌得顯，名為法身。觀照得顯，名為般若。資成得顯，名為解脫。此兩即是定慧莊嚴，莊嚴法身。法身是乘體，定慧是眾具。下文云：「其車高廣，眾寶莊校。」是名圓教行人所乘之乘，到薩婆若，過茶無字可說。無字可說，亦應無乘可運。若自行運畢，乘義則休。若權化未畢，運他不休。故文云：「佛自住大乘，如其所得法，定慧力莊嚴，以此度眾生。」即其義也。譬如御者，運車達到，猶名為車。果乘亦爾，猶名為運。

> Contemplative illumination: simply pointing to true nature, quiescent yet constantly illuminating—this is contemplative illumination, which is Ultimate Emptiness. Resource accomplishment: simply pointing to the true‑nature dharma‑realm, containing and storing all practices, immeasurable implements—this is Tathāgatagarbha. The three dharmas are neither one nor different, like pointing to a wish‑fulfilling jewel and discussing its light and treasure: light and treasure are not one with the jewel, nor different from the jewel; neither vertical nor horizontal. The three dharmas are also thus: also one, also not one, also neither one nor not one—an inconceivable three dharmas. If one is confused about these three dharmas, then they become three obstacles: first, the dust‑and‑sand [obstacles] within the realm and outside the realm obstruct Tathāgatagarbha; second, the view‑and‑thought [obstacles] of the Common and Distinct [teachings] obstruct Ultimate Emptiness; third, root ignorance obstructs Ultimate Truth. If through dust‑and‑sand obstacles one reaches innumerable dharma‑gates, then the Resource Accomplishment Track is revealed. If through view‑and‑thought obstacles one reaches Ultimate Emptiness, then the Contemplative Illumination Track is revealed. If through root‑ignorance obstacle one reaches Ultimate Truth, then the True Nature Track is revealed. When the True Nature Track is revealed, it is named Dharma‑body. When contemplation is revealed, it is named prajñā. When resource accomplishment is revealed, it is named liberation. These two are concentration‑and‑wisdom adornments, adorning the Dharma‑body. The Dharma‑body is the vehicle body; concentration‑and‑wisdom are the implements. The text below says: "Its cart is high and broad, adorned with many jewels." This is named the vehicle ridden by practitioners of the Perfect Teaching; reaching sarvajña, passing the "cha" [stage], there are no words to speak. When no words can be spoken, there should also be no vehicle to transport. If self‑transport is completed, the meaning of vehicle then rests; if expedient transformation is not yet completed, transporting others does not rest. Therefore the text says: "The Buddha himself dwells in the Great Vehicle; according to the dharma he has obtained, adorned by the power of concentration and wisdom, by this he ferries sentient beings." This is precisely the meaning. For example, a charioteer transports a cart to its destination and it is still called a cart; the fruit‑vehicle is likewise, still named a transport.

復次，何必一向以運義釋乘？若取真性，不動、不出，則非運非不運。若取觀照、資成，能動、能出，則名為運。秖動出即不動出；即不動出是動出。即用而論體，動出是不動出；即體而論用，即不動出是動出。體用不二而二耳。例如：轉、不轉，皆阿鞞跋致；動、不動，皆是毘尼。以是義故，發趣、不發趣，皆名為乘也(云云)。

> Furthermore, why must one always explain "vehicle" by the meaning of transport? If one takes true nature—non‑moving and non‑exiting—then it is neither transport nor not‑transport. If one takes contemplative illumination and resource accomplishment, able to move and able to exit, then it is called transport. Simply moving and exiting is non‑moving and non‑exiting; precisely non‑moving and non‑exiting is moving and exiting. Discussed in terms of function, moving and exiting are non‑moving and non‑exiting; discussed in terms of body, non‑moving and non‑exiting are moving and exiting. Body and function are non‑dual yet dual. For example: turning and not turning are both avinivartanīya; moving and not moving are both vinaya. For this reason, setting forth and not setting forth are both named vehicle (and so on).

三、明麁妙者，三藏於有為福德，論三法為乘。四念處是聞慧，乘於教乘，到四善根。四善根乘於行乘，到見諦。見諦乘於證乘，到無學。既是權法，出三界外，以真為證。證則不運、不見實乘。嗚呼自責，欲問世尊，為失、為不失？即此意也。半字漸引，非究竟義，是故三法皆麁也。通教即空慧，三法為乘巧，餘意大同。乾慧地乘於教乘，性地乘於行乘，八人見地乘於證乘。此亦偏說，是故為麁。別教以資成資於觀照，觀照開於真性，三法為乘。十信乘教、十住乘行、十地乘證，到妙覺薩婆若中住。緣，修成即謝，唯真修在。若爾，資成在前，觀照居次，真性在後。此三豎別，縱非大乘，此三並異，橫非大乘，是方便法，是故為麁也。

> Third, clarifying coarse and subtle: in the Tripiṭaka [teaching], with conditioned meritorious virtue, it discusses the three dharmas as vehicles. The four mindfulnesses are hearing wisdom, riding the teaching‑vehicle to reach the four good roots. The four good roots ride the practice‑vehicle to reach seeing the truths. Seeing the truths rides the realization‑vehicle to reach no‑learning. Since it is an expedient dharma, it exits the three realms and takes truth as realization. Realization then does not transport and does not see the real vehicle. Alas, self‑reproaching, wishing to ask the World‑Honored One whether it is loss or not‑loss—this is the intent. The half‑character gradually leads; it is not the ultimate meaning; therefore the three dharmas are all coarse. The Common Teaching uses wisdom of emptiness; the three dharmas are vehicles in a skillful way; the rest of the meaning is largely the same. The dry‑wisdom ground rides the teaching‑vehicle, the nature ground rides the practice‑vehicle, and the eight‑persons seeing‑ground rides the realization‑vehicle. This too is a partial explanation, therefore it is coarse. The Distinct Teaching uses resource accomplishment to support contemplative illumination, and contemplative illumination opens to true nature; the three dharmas are vehicles. The ten faiths ride the teaching, the ten abodes ride practice, the ten grounds ride realization, dwelling in subtle‑awakening sarvajña. When the conditioning and cultivation are completed, they are set aside; only true cultivation remains. If so, resource accomplishment is first, contemplative illumination is next, true nature is last. These three are vertically distinct; vertically they are not Mahāyāna; these three are also mutually different, horizontally not Mahāyāna; they are expedient dharmas, therefore they are coarse.

圓教點實相為第一義空，名空為縱。第一義空即是實相，實相不縱，此空豈縱？點實相為如來藏，名之為橫。如來藏即實相，實相不橫，此藏豈橫？故不可以縱思、不可以橫思，故名不可思議法，即是妙也。秖點空、藏為實相，空縱、藏橫，實相那不縱橫？秖點空為如來藏，空既不橫，藏那得橫？點如來藏為空，藏既不縱，空那得縱？點實相為空、藏，實相非縱非橫，空、藏亦非縱非橫，宛轉相即，不可思議，故名為妙。秖點如來藏為廣，點第一義空為高，故言其車高廣。如來藏即實相，故其車非廣。第一義空即實相，故其車非高。秖實相是空，那得非高？秖實相是如來藏，那得非廣？又點實相為如來藏，故言眾寶莊校，又多僕從而侍衛之。點實相為第一義空，故言有大白牛，肥壯多力，行步平正，其疾如風，智慧無染，名為白。能破惑，故名多力。中道慧，名平正。入無功用，故其疾如風。不思議三法，共成大車，豈有縱橫並別之異？

> In the Perfect Teaching, pointing to the real mark as Ultimate Emptiness, emptiness is named vertical. Ultimate Emptiness is precisely the real mark; the real mark is not vertical—how could this emptiness be vertical? Pointing to the real mark as Tathāgatagarbha is named horizontal. Tathāgatagarbha is precisely the real mark; the real mark is not horizontal—how could this store be horizontal? Therefore it cannot be thought of as vertical, cannot be thought of as horizontal; thus it is named the inconceivable dharma, which is subtle. If one merely points to emptiness and the store as the real mark—emptiness vertical, store horizontal—how could the real mark not be vertical and horizontal? If one merely points to emptiness as Tathāgatagarbha, emptiness already is not horizontal—how could the store be horizontal? If one points to Tathāgatagarbha as emptiness, the store already is not vertical—how could emptiness be vertical? Pointing to the real mark as emptiness and store: the real mark is neither vertical nor horizontal; emptiness and store are also neither vertical nor horizontal; they interpenetrate in turn, inconceivable, therefore named subtle. If one merely points to Tathāgatagarbha as broad and points to Ultimate Emptiness as high, therefore it says its cart is high and broad. Tathāgatagarbha is precisely the real mark, therefore its cart is not broad. Ultimate Emptiness is precisely the real mark, therefore its cart is not high. If the real mark is precisely emptiness, how could it not be high? If the real mark is precisely Tathāgatagarbha, how could it not be broad? Again, pointing to the real mark as Tathāgatagarbha, therefore it says "adorned with many jewels" and with many attendants who guard it. Pointing to the real mark as Ultimate Emptiness, therefore it says there is a great white ox, fat and strong, with many powers, walking straight, its speed like the wind; wisdom without defilement is named white. Able to break delusion, therefore named many powers. Middle‑way wisdom is named straight. Entering the no‑effort state, therefore its speed is like the wind. The inconceivable three dharmas together form the great cart—how could there be differences of vertical, horizontal, and separate?

如是教乘，不縱不橫，五品所乘，到於似解。如是行乘，不縱不橫，似解所乘，到於十住。如是證乘，不縱不橫，十住所乘，到於妙覺薩婆若中住，故名妙乘。又云：「是乘微妙，清淨第一。」故瓦官建講，人夢聽者駕乘闐門而出；彼處建講，人夢黃衣滿路。以相則之，邪正明矣！

> Thus the teaching‑vehicle, not vertical and not horizontal, is ridden by the five grades and reaches the stage of resemblance understanding. Thus the practice‑vehicle, not vertical and not horizontal, is ridden by resemblance understanding and reaches the ten abodes. Thus the realization‑vehicle, not vertical and not horizontal, is ridden by the ten abodes and reaches subtle‑awakening sarvajña, therefore it is named the subtle vehicle. It also says: "This vehicle is subtle and wonderful, pure and foremost." Therefore, when the Waguān Monastery established lectures, a listener dreamed that riders and carts filled the gate and exited; when that place established lectures, a listener dreamed that yellow‑robed [monks] filled the road. By these images, the distinction between wrong and right is clear.

若將此麁妙等乘，約五味者，乳教一麁一妙。酪教一麁。生蘇三麁一妙。熟蘇二麁一妙。眾經悉帶縱橫方便，說不縱、不橫之真實，故言為麁。今經正直捨方便，故加之以妙(云云)。

> If these coarse and subtle vehicles are matched to the five flavors: in the milk teaching there is one coarse and one subtle; in the curd teaching there is one coarse; in the fresh ghee there are three coarse and one subtle; in the mature ghee there are two coarse and one subtle. The various sūtras all carry vertical and horizontal expedients and speak the real that is not vertical and not horizontal, therefore they are called coarse. This sūtra directly and straightforwardly abandons expedients, therefore it adds subtlety to it (and so on).

四、開麁顯妙者，約《大經》三句也。經言：「佛性亦一」者，一切眾生悉一乘故。此是不動、不出之一乘，故具足三法，不縱、不橫。夫有心者皆備此理，而其家大小都無知者，是故為麁。今示眾生諸覺寶藏，耘除草穢，開顯藏金。一切無礙人，一道出生死。十方諦求，更無餘乘，唯一佛乘，是故為妙。經言：「佛性亦非一非非一。」數、非數法，不決定故。若執緣修智慧，定能顯理；慧自非理，則照用不明，不見佛性，是故為麁。今開定執之慧，即不決定慧，即慧而理、即理而慧，不執著數，定三定一，不著非數，非三非一，如此乃名無著妙慧。能破一切定相及不定相，亦無能破、所破。如輪王能破能安，如日除闇生物，如醫除膜養珠，即是大乘不縱不橫之妙慧也。經言：「佛性亦非一」說三乘故。即是三乘、五乘、七乘等諸方便乘。若住諸乘，但是事善，及以偏真，通入處近，是故為麁。今若決了諸乘即是如來藏，藏名佛性。從人天善乃至別乘，皆不動本法，即是於妙。當知，三句攝一切法，無非佛性，悉皆是妙。無麁可待，即絕待妙也。

> Fourth, opening the coarse and revealing the subtle, in terms of the three sentences of the *Great Sutra*. The sūtra says: "Buddha‑nature is also one"—because all sentient beings are entirely one vehicle. This is the one vehicle that does not move and does not exit; therefore it fully possesses the three dharmas, not vertical and not horizontal. Those with minds all possess this principle, yet their households great and small are all unaware; therefore it is coarse. Now he shows sentient beings the treasure store of various awakenings, weeds them and removes the grasses, opens and reveals the store of gold; all unimpeded people, one road exits birth and death. Seeking in the ten directions, there is no other vehicle, only the One Buddha Vehicle—therefore it is subtle. The sūtra says: "Buddha‑nature is also not one and not not one." Enumerable and non‑enumerable dharmas are not fixed. If one clings to conditioned cultivation of wisdom and determines it can reveal principle, wisdom itself is not principle; then its illuminating function is not bright, and one does not see Buddha‑nature—therefore it is coarse. Now he opens the fixation on samādhi wisdom: it is the non‑fixed wisdom; it is wisdom and thus principle, principle and thus wisdom; not clinging to numbers, determining three and determining one; not attached to non‑number, neither three nor one—thus it is named non‑attached subtle wisdom. It can break all fixed marks and unfixed marks, and also has no breaker and nothing broken. Like a wheel‑turning king who can break and can pacify, like the sun that removes darkness and gives birth to things, like a physician who removes a membrane and nourishes a pearl—this is the subtle wisdom of the Mahāyāna, not vertical and not horizontal. The sūtra says: "Buddha‑nature is also not one"—speaking of the three vehicles. This is the various expedient vehicles of three, five, seven, and so forth. If one abides in those vehicles, that is only phenomenal goodness and partial truth, close to the place of entry—therefore it is coarse. Now if one decisively understands that the various vehicles are precisely Tathāgatagarbha, the store is named Buddha‑nature; from human and heavenly goodness up to the distinct vehicle, all do not move the original dharma—this is in the subtle. You should know: the three sentences encompass all dharmas; none are not Buddha‑nature; all are subtle. There is no coarse to await; this is absolute subtlety.

五、明始終者，不取五品教乘為始，乃取凡地一念之心，具十法界、十種相性，為三法之始。何者？十種相性秖是三軌。如是體即真性軌；如是性，性以據內，即是觀照軌；如是相者，相以據外，即是福德，是資成軌。力者是了因，是觀照軌；作者是萬行精勤，即是資成；因者是習因，屬觀照。緣者是報因，屬資成；果者是習果，屬觀照；報者是習報，屬資成。本末等者，空等，即觀照；假等即資成；中等即真性。直就一界十如論於三軌。今但明凡心一念，即皆具十法界，一一界悉有煩惱性相、惡業性相、苦道性相。若有無明煩惱性相，即是智慧觀照性相。何者？以迷明故起無明。若解無明，即是於明。《大經》云：「無明轉，即變為明。」《淨名》云：「無明即是明。」當知，不離無明而有於明，如氷是水，如水是氷。

> Fifth, clarifying beginning and end: it does not take the five grades of the teaching‑vehicle as the beginning; rather it takes a single thought of the ordinary mind on the ordinary ground, which possesses the ten dharma‑realms and the ten kinds of marks and natures, as the beginning of the three dharmas. Why? The ten kinds of marks and natures are only the three tracks. Thus the substance is the True Nature Track; thus the nature—nature as based within—is the Contemplative Illumination Track; thus the mark—mark as based outward—is merit, the Resource Accomplishment Track. Power is the understanding cause, the Contemplative Illumination Track; activity is the diligence of myriad practices, which is Resource Accomplishment; cause is the habitual cause, belonging to contemplation. Condition is the retribution cause, belonging to resource accomplishment; fruit is the habitual fruit, belonging to contemplation; retribution is the habitual retribution, belonging to resource accomplishment. Root and end equivalence: equivalence with emptiness is contemplation; equivalence with provisional is resource accomplishment; equivalence with middle is true nature. Directly within one realm’s ten suchnesses one discusses the three tracks. Now only clarifying that a single thought of the ordinary mind already possesses the ten dharma‑realms; each and every realm has affliction nature‑marks, evil‑karma nature‑marks, and suffering‑path nature‑marks. If there are ignorance‑affliction nature‑marks, that is wisdom‑contemplation nature‑marks. Why? Because ignorance arises from being deluded about clarity; if one understands ignorance, it is precisely clarity. The *Great Sutra* says: "When ignorance turns, it transforms into clarity." The *Vimalakīrti* says: "Ignorance itself is clarity." You should know that without departing from ignorance there is clarity, as ice is water, and water is ice.

又凡夫心，一念即具十界，悉有惡業性相，秖惡性相即善性相，由惡有善，離惡無善，翻於諸惡，即善資成。如竹中有火性，未即是火事，故有而不燒，遇緣事成，即能燒物。惡即善性，未即是事。遇緣成事，即能翻惡。如竹有火，火出還燒竹。惡中有善，善成還破惡。故即惡性相是善性相也。凡夫一念，皆有十界識、名色等苦道性相。迷此苦道，生死浩然，此是迷法身為苦道，不離苦道別有法身。如迷南為北，無別南也。若悟生死，即是法身，故云：苦道性相即是法身性相也。

> Again, the ordinary person’s mind: a single thought already possesses the ten realms, all having evil‑karma nature‑marks; only evil nature‑marks are good nature‑marks; because of evil there is good, without evil there is no good; turning over all evils, good resource accomplishment arises. As with bamboo containing the nature of fire: it is not yet the fire‑event; therefore it has [fire] without burning. Meeting conditions, the event is completed and it can burn things. Evil is good in nature; not yet the event. Meeting conditions, the event is completed, and it can turn over evil. Like bamboo has fire; when fire comes out it burns the bamboo. Evil contains good; when good is completed it breaks evil. Therefore evil nature‑marks are good nature‑marks. The ordinary person’s one thought has the suffering‑path nature‑marks of the ten‑realm consciousness, name‑and‑form, and so on. Deluded about this suffering path, birth and death are vast; this is being deluded about the Dharma‑body as the suffering path—there is no Dharma‑body apart from the suffering path. Like mistaking south for north, there is no separate south. If one awakens to birth and death, it is the Dharma‑body; therefore it says: the suffering‑path nature‑marks are precisely the Dharma‑body nature‑marks.

夫有心者，皆有三道性相，即是三軌性相。故《淨名》云：「煩惱之儔，為如來種。」此之謂也。若言如是力、如是作者，菩提心發也，即是真性等萌動。如是因者，即是觀照萌動。如是緣者，即是資成萌動。如是果者，由觀照萌動，成習因，感得般若習果滿也。如是報者，由資成萌動，為緣因，感得解脫報果滿也。果報滿故，法身亦滿，是為三德究竟滿，名祕密藏。本末等者，性德三軌，冥伏不縱、不橫；修德三軌，彰顯不縱、不橫。冥伏如等、數等、妙等；彰顯如等、數等、妙等，故言等也。亦是空等、假等、中等(云云)。

> Those with minds all have the three‑path nature‑marks, which are the three‑track nature‑marks. Therefore the *Vimalakīrti* says: "The companions of afflictions are the Tathāgata’s seeds." This is what it means. If one says such power and such activity—the bodhi mind arises—this is the sprouting of true nature and so forth. Such cause is the sprouting of contemplative illumination. Such condition is the sprouting of resource accomplishment. Such fruit: from the sprouting of contemplation, it becomes the habitual cause and yields the retribution of the perfection of prajñā’s habitual fruit. Such retribution: from the sprouting of resource accomplishment, it becomes the condition cause and yields the retribution of liberation’s fruit. When fruits and retributions are complete, the Dharma‑body is also complete; this is the ultimate completion of the three virtues, named the secret store. Root and end equivalence: the three tracks of inherent virtue, hidden and subdued, not vertical and not horizontal; the three tracks of cultivated virtue, manifest and revealed, not vertical and not horizontal. Hidden and subdued: like‑equivalence, number‑equivalence, subtle‑equivalence; manifest and revealed: like‑equivalence, number‑equivalence, subtle‑equivalence—therefore it is called equivalence. It is also emptiness‑equivalence, provisional‑equivalence, and middle‑equivalence (and so on).

六、類通三法者，前以三軌之法，從始以至終，即是豎通無礙。今欲橫通諸法，悉使無礙，類通諸三法。何者？赴緣名異，得意義同，粗通十條，餘者可領。三道、三識、三佛性、三般若、三菩提、三大乘、三身、三涅槃、三寶、三德。諸三法無量，止用十者，舉其大要，明始終耳。三道輪迴，生死本法，故為初。若欲逆生死流，須解三識、知三佛性、起三智慧、發三菩提心、行三大乘、證三身、成三涅槃，是三寶，利益一切，化緣盡，入於三德，住祕密藏(云云)。

> Sixth, classifying and penetrating the three dharmas: previously, the dharmas of the three tracks—from beginning to end—were vertical penetration without obstruction. Now, wanting to horizontally penetrate the various dharmas so that all are without obstruction, we classify and penetrate the various three dharmas. What are they? Meeting conditions, names differ; grasping the meaning, the significance is the same. Roughly penetrating ten items; the rest can be understood. The three paths, three consciousnesses, three Buddha‑natures, three prajñās, three bodhis, three great vehicles, three bodies, three nirvāṇas, three jewels, three virtues. The various three dharmas are immeasurable; only ten are used, raising the main points to clarify beginning and end. The three paths revolve; birth and death are the fundamental dharma, therefore they are first. If one wishes to reverse the flow of birth and death, one must understand the three consciousnesses, know the three Buddha‑natures, arouse the three wisdoms, generate the three bodhi minds, practice the three great vehicles, realize the three bodies, accomplish the three nirvāṇas, make the three jewels, benefit all, and when transformation conditions are exhausted, enter the three virtues and dwell in the secret store (and so on).

一、類通三道者：真性軌即苦道；觀照軌即煩惱道；資成軌即業道。苦道即真性者，下文云：「世間相常住」，豈不即彼生死而是法身耶？煩惱即觀照，觀照本照惑，無惑則無照，一切法空是也。文云：「諸法從本來，常自寂滅相。」即煩惱是觀照也。照如薪生火。文云：「於諸過去佛，若有聞一句，皆已成佛道。」又云：「深達罪福相，遍照於十方。」即是聞於體達煩惱之妙句也。資成即業道者，惡是善資，無惡亦無善。文云：「惡鬼入其心，罵詈毀辱我，我等念佛故，皆當忍是事。」惡不來加，不得用念，用念由於惡加(云云)。又威音王佛所著法之眾，聞不輕言，罵詈打拍；由惡業故，還值不輕，不輕教化，皆得不退。又提婆達多是善知識，豈非惡即資成？三軌即三道，是為理性，行於非道，通達佛道。五品，觀行行於非道，通達佛道。六根清淨，相似行於非道，通達佛道。十住去，即分真行於非道，通達佛道。妙覺，究竟行於非道，通達佛道(云云)。

> 1. Classifying and penetrating the three paths: the True Nature Track is the suffering path; the Contemplative Illumination Track is the affliction path; the Resource Accomplishment Track is the karma path. If the suffering path is true nature, the text below says: "The worldly marks are constantly abiding"—is not that birth‑and‑death precisely the Dharma‑body? Affliction is contemplative illumination; contemplative illumination fundamentally illuminates delusion; without delusion there is no illumination—this is the emptiness of all dharmas. The text says: "From the beginning, all dharmas are always quiescent and extinct in mark." This is that affliction is contemplative illumination. Illumination is like fire arising from fuel. The text says: "Among all past Buddhas, if there is someone who hears a single sentence, they have all already attained Buddhahood." It also says: "Deeply penetrating the marks of offense and merit, it universally illuminates the ten directions." This is the wonderful sentence of hearing and penetrating affliction in its very body. Resource accomplishment is the karma path: evil is the resource of good; without evil there is no good. The text says: "Evil spirits enter their minds, revile and insult me; we, because we recite the Buddha, should all endure these matters." If evil does not come to add [itself], one cannot use mindfulness; the use of mindfulness is because evil adds (and so on). Further, the assembly attached to the dharma of Buddha King Awesome‑Voice heard the Un‑Disparaging words and reviled and beat [him]; because of evil karma they again met [the] Un‑Disparaging [bodhisattva]; Un‑Disparaging taught and transformed, and all attained non‑retrogression. Further, Devadatta is a good spiritual friend—how is that not evil being resource accomplishment? The three tracks are the three paths; this is the principle‑nature. Practicing the non‑path, one penetrates the Buddha‑path. The five grades: contemplative practice practices the non‑path and penetrates the Buddha‑path. Six‑roots purity: resemblance practice practices the non‑path and penetrates the Buddha‑path. From the ten abodes onward: partial‑true practice practices the non‑path and penetrates the Buddha‑path. Subtle awakening: ultimate practice practices the non‑path and penetrates the Buddha‑path (and so on).

二、類通三識者，菴摩羅識即真性軌；阿黎耶識即觀照軌；阿陀那識即資成軌。若地人明阿黎耶是真常淨識攝；大乘人云是無記、無明、隨眠之識，亦名無沒識，九識乃名淨識互諍(云云)。今例近況遠，如一人心復何定？為善則善識，為惡即惡識，不為善惡，即無記識。此三識，何容頓同水火？秖背善為惡，背惡為善，背善惡為無記。秖是一人三心耳。三識亦應如是，若阿黎耶中，有生死種子，熏習增長，即成分別識。若阿黎耶中，有智慧種子，聞熏習增長，即轉依成道後真如，名為淨識。若異此兩識，秖是阿黎耶識。此亦一法論三，三中論一耳。《攝論》云：「如金、土、染、淨。染譬六識；金譬淨識；土譬黎耶識。」明文在茲，何勞苦諍？下文譬如有人至親友家，醉酒而臥，豈非阿黎耶識？世間狂惑，分別之識起已遊行，以求衣食，豈非阿陀那識？聞熏種子稍起增長，會遇親友，示以衣珠，豈非菴摩羅識？菴摩羅識，名無分別智光。若黎耶中，有此智種子，即理性無分別智光。五品，觀行無分別智光。六根清淨，相似無分別智光。初住去，分真無分別智光。妙覺，究竟無分別智光。麁妙(云云)。

> 2. Classifying and penetrating the three consciousnesses: the āmalavijñāna consciousness is the True Nature Track; the ālaya consciousness is the Contemplative Illumination Track; the ādāna consciousness is the Resource Accomplishment Track. If those of the ground clarify that the ālaya is included in the true, permanent, pure consciousness; Mahāyāna people say it is the indeterminate, ignorance, and latent‑tendency consciousness, also named the non‑perishing consciousness; the nine consciousnesses are then named the pure consciousness—these contend with each other (and so on). Now, taking the near to analogize the far: for one person’s mind, what can be fixed? When it is good, it is good consciousness; when it is evil, it is evil consciousness; when it is neither good nor evil, it is indeterminate consciousness. How could these three consciousnesses be identical like water and fire? It is only that turning away from good is evil, turning away from evil is good, turning away from good and evil is indeterminate—only one person with three minds. The three consciousnesses should be likewise. If within the ālaya there are seeds of birth‑and‑death, perfumed and increasing, it becomes discriminating consciousness. If within the ālaya there are seeds of wisdom, heard and perfumed, increasing, then by turning reliance it becomes the suchness after the path, named pure consciousness. If it differs from these two consciousnesses, it is only the ālaya consciousness. This too is one dharma discussed as three, and within the three, discussing the one. The *Mahāyānasaṃgraha‑śāstra* says: "Like gold, earth, stain, and purity. Stain is likened to the six consciousnesses; gold is likened to the pure consciousness; earth is likened to the ālaya consciousness." The clear text is here—what labor is there to argue? The text below likens it to someone who goes to a close friend’s house and lies drunk; is this not the ālaya consciousness? The worldly are crazed and deluded; the discriminating consciousness rises and wanders to seek clothes and food—how is this not the ādāna consciousness? The seeds perfumed by hearing gradually arise and increase; meeting a close friend who shows the clothing‑pearl—how is this not the āmalavijñāna consciousness? The āmalavijñāna consciousness is named the light of non‑discriminating wisdom. If within the ālaya there are seeds of this wisdom, it is the intrinsic light of non‑discriminating wisdom. The five grades: contemplative practice’s non‑discriminating wisdom light. Six‑roots purity: resemblance non‑discriminating wisdom light. From the first abode onward: partial‑true non‑discriminating wisdom light. Subtle awakening: ultimate non‑discriminating wisdom light. Coarse and subtle (and so on).

三、類通三佛性者，真性軌即是正因性；觀照軌即是了因性；資成軌即是緣因性。故下文云：「汝實我子；我實汝父。」即正因性。又云：「我昔教汝無上道故，一切智願猶在不失。」智即了因性，願即緣因性。又云：「我不敢輕於汝等，汝等皆當作佛。」即正因性。「是時四眾，以讀誦眾經」即了因性。「修諸功德」即緣因性。又云：「長者諸子，若十、二十，乃至三十。」此即三種佛性。又云：「種種性相義，我已悉知見。」既言種種性，即有三種佛性也。若知三軌即三佛性，是名理佛性。五品，觀行見佛性。六根，相似見佛性。十住至等覺，分真見佛性。妙覺，究竟見佛性。是故稱妙(云云)。

> 3. Classifying and penetrating the three Buddha‑natures: the True Nature Track is the right‑cause nature; the Contemplative Illumination Track is the understanding‑cause nature; the Resource Accomplishment Track is the condition‑cause nature. Therefore the text below says: "You are truly my children; I am truly your father"—this is the right‑cause nature. It also says: "Because I formerly taught you the unsurpassed path, the vow for all‑knowledge still remains and is not lost." Wisdom is the understanding‑cause nature; vow is the condition‑cause nature. It also says: "I do not dare slight you; you will all become Buddhas"—this is the right‑cause nature. "At that time the four assemblies, by reading and reciting the various sūtras" is the understanding‑cause nature. "Cultivating various merits" is the condition‑cause nature. It also says: "The elder’s sons, whether ten, twenty, up to thirty"—this is the three kinds of Buddha‑nature. It also says: "The meanings of various natures and marks, I have all seen and known." Since it says various natures, there are three kinds of Buddha‑nature. If one knows the three tracks are the three Buddha‑natures, this is named principle Buddha‑nature. The five grades: contemplative practice sees Buddha‑nature. Six roots: resemblance sees Buddha‑nature. Ten abodes to equal‑awakening: partial‑true sees Buddha‑nature. Subtle awakening: ultimate seeing of Buddha‑nature. Therefore it is called subtle (and so on).

四、類通三般若者，真性是實相般若；觀照是觀照般若；資成是文字般若。具如上釋境、智、行三妙之相。故下文云：「止止不須說，我法妙難思。」又云：「是法不可示，言辭相寂滅。」即實相般若。「我及十方佛，乃能知是相。」「唯佛與佛，乃能究盡。」又云：「我所得智慧，微妙最第一。」即觀照般若。又云：「我常知眾生，行道不行道，隨應所可度，為說種種法。」若干言辭，隨宜方便，即是文字般若。又云：「如來知見廣大深遠。」廣大深遠即實相般若。如來知見稱廣大深遠，即觀照般若。若言方便、知見皆已具足，即文字般若。故知三軌亦三般若之異名耳。若三智在三心、屬三人，是則為麁。三智在一心中，不縱不橫，是則理妙。五品，觀行三般若。六根淨，相似三般若。四十心，分真三般若。妙覺，究竟三般若也。

> 4. Classifying and penetrating the three prajñās: true nature is real‑mark prajñā; contemplation is contemplative prajñā; resource accomplishment is textual prajñā. This is fully as explained above for the three subtleties of realm, wisdom, and practice. Therefore the text below says: "Stop, stop; no need to speak; my dharma is subtle and hard to conceive." It also says: "This dharma cannot be shown; the marks of words are quiescent and extinguished"—this is real‑mark prajñā. "I and the Buddhas of the ten directions are then able to know this mark." "Only Buddha with Buddha can fully exhaust [it]"—this is contemplative prajñā. It also says: "The wisdom I have attained is subtle and most first"—this is contemplative prajñā. It also says: "I always know sentient beings, whether they practice the path or not; according to what can be saved, I speak various dharmas." The various words and phrases, according to suitability and expedients, are textual prajñā. It also says: "The Tathāgata’s knowledge and seeing is broad and profound." Broad and profound is real‑mark prajñā. The Tathāgata’s knowledge and seeing being called broad and profound is contemplative prajñā. If one says expedients and knowledge‑seeing are all already complete, that is textual prajñā. Therefore one knows the three tracks are also different names for the three prajñās. If the three wisdoms are in three minds and belong to three persons, that is coarse. The three wisdoms in one mind, not vertical and not horizontal, is principle subtlety. The five grades: contemplative practice’s three prajñās. Six‑root purity: resemblance three prajñās. The forty minds: partial‑true three prajñās. Subtle awakening: ultimate three prajñās.

五、類通三菩提者，真性軌即實相菩提；觀照軌即實智菩提；資成軌方便菩提。故下文云：「我先不言汝等皆得阿耨三菩提。」「非實、非虛、非如、非異，不如三界，見於三界。」即實相菩提。「我成道已來，甚大久遠。」即實智菩提。「我說少出家，近伽耶城，得三菩提。」即方便菩提。若就弟子明三菩提者，「若我遇眾生，盡教以佛道。」即實相菩提。「安住實智中，我定當作佛。」又云：「佛子行道已，來世得作佛。」「乘是寶乘，直至道場。」即是修成實智菩提。授八相記，即方便菩提。不一異者，名之為如。不決了名麁，決了名為妙。一切眾生，理性菩提。五品，名字菩提。六根，相似菩提。四十一位，分真菩提。妙覺，究竟菩提(云云)。

> 5. Classifying and penetrating the three bodhis: the True Nature Track is real‑mark bodhi; the Contemplative Illumination Track is real‑wisdom bodhi; the Resource Accomplishment Track is expedient bodhi. Therefore the text below says: "I previously did not say that you would all attain anuttarā‑samyak‑saṃbodhi." "Neither real, nor false, nor such, nor different; not like the three realms, yet seen within the three realms"—this is real‑mark bodhi. "Since I accomplished the path, it has been very long"—this is real‑wisdom bodhi. "I said I left home a short while ago, near the city of Gayā, and attained bodhi"—this is expedient bodhi. If one explains three bodhis in terms of disciples: "If I encounter sentient beings, I completely teach them the Buddha path"—this is real‑mark bodhi. "Abiding in real wisdom, I will certainly become a Buddha." It also says: "The Buddha‑child has practiced the path and in a later life will become a Buddha." "Riding this jeweled vehicle, directly to the bodhimaṇḍa"—this is the cultivation‑completed real‑wisdom bodhi. Receiving the eight‑aspect prediction is expedient bodhi. Not one, not different is named thusness. Not decisively understood is named coarse; decisively understood is named subtle. All sentient beings have principle bodhi. The five grades: name‑only bodhi. Six roots: resemblance bodhi. The forty‑one positions: partial‑true bodhi. Subtle awakening: ultimate bodhi (and so on).

六、類通三大乘者，真性即理乘；觀照即隨乘；資成即得乘。故下文云：「佛自住大乘，如其所得法，定慧力莊嚴。」住大乘即理乘；定慧莊嚴即隨乘；所得法即得乘。「佛自住大乘」是理乘；「於道場知已」是隨乘；「導師方便說」是得乘。又「舍利弗！以本願故，說三乘法。」是得乘、隨乘。又，「是乘微妙清淨第一」是理乘。「於一佛乘」是理乘；「分別說三」是得乘、隨乘。不縱不橫妙，開麁妙、歷七位(云云)。五品，名字乘。六根，相似乘。四十一位，分真乘。妙覺，究竟乘(云云)。

> 6. Classifying and penetrating the three great vehicles: true nature is the principle vehicle; contemplative illumination is the following vehicle; resource accomplishment is the attained vehicle. Therefore the text below says: "The Buddha himself dwells in the Great Vehicle; according to the dharma he has obtained, adorned by the power of concentration and wisdom." Dwelling in the Great Vehicle is the principle vehicle; concentration‑and‑wisdom adornment is the following vehicle; the obtained dharma is the attained vehicle. "The Buddha himself dwells in the Great Vehicle" is the principle vehicle; "At the bodhimaṇḍa he has known it" is the following vehicle; "The guide speaks expediently" is the attained vehicle. Also, "Śāriputra! Because of the original vow, [I] speak the three‑vehicle dharma"—this is attained and following vehicles. Also, "This vehicle is subtle, pure, and foremost" is the principle vehicle. "Within the One Buddha Vehicle" is the principle vehicle; "discriminating to speak three" is the attained and following vehicles. Not vertical and not horizontal is subtle, opening the coarse and subtle, and passing through seven positions (and so on). The five grades: name‑only vehicle. Six roots: resemblance vehicle. The forty‑one positions: partial‑true vehicle. Subtle awakening: ultimate vehicle (and so on).

七、類通三身者，真性軌即法身；觀照即報身；資成即應身。若《新金光明》云：「依於法身，得有報身；依於報身，得有應身。」此即如前所明，依於境妙，得有智妙；依於智妙，得有行妙。彼文云：「佛真法身，猶如虛空，應物現形，如水中月。」報身即天月。此文云：「佛自住大乘」即是實相之身，猶如虛空。「定慧力莊嚴」慧如天月，定如水月。又云：「唯佛與佛，乃能究盡諸法實相。」即是法身。「我所得智慧，微妙最第一。」即是報身。「名稱普聞」即是應身。又，非生、現生等，是應身也。或示己身，即法身、報身。或示他身，即報、應。「我以相嚴身，光明照十方，為說實相印。」實相印即法身；照十方即應身；相嚴身即報身。又「深達罪福相，遍照於十方。」即報身；「微妙淨法身」即法身；「具相三十二」即應身。三軌名異，義即三身，故《普賢觀》云：「佛三種身，從方等生。」《法界性論》云：「水銀和真金，能塗諸色像，功德和法身，處處應現往。」若此三身不縱不橫，妙決了三身入法身妙。歷七位妙(云云)。

> 7. Classifying and penetrating the three bodies: the True Nature Track is the Dharma‑body; contemplative illumination is the reward‑body; resource accomplishment is the response‑body. If the *New Golden Light* says: "Relying on the Dharma‑body, one obtains the reward‑body; relying on the reward‑body, one obtains the response‑body"—this is as previously clarified: relying on realm subtlety, one obtains wisdom subtlety; relying on wisdom subtlety, one obtains practice subtlety. That text says: "The Buddha’s true Dharma‑body is like empty space; responding to objects, it manifests forms, like the moon in water." The reward‑body is the heavenly moon. This text says: "The Buddha himself dwells in the Great Vehicle"—this is the body of real mark, like empty space. "Adorned by the power of concentration and wisdom"—wisdom is like the heavenly moon, concentration is like the water‑moon. It also says: "Only Buddha with Buddha can fully exhaust the real marks of all dharmas"—this is the Dharma‑body. "The wisdom I have attained is subtle and most first"—this is the reward‑body. "The name and renown are widely heard"—this is the response‑body. Also, not born, manifestly born, and so on—these are the response‑body. Or revealing one’s own body is the Dharma‑body and reward‑body. Or revealing another’s body is reward and response. "I adorn my body with marks, light shining in the ten directions, to preach the real‑mark seal"—the real‑mark seal is the Dharma‑body; shining in the ten directions is the response‑body; the body adorned with marks is the reward‑body. Also, "deeply penetrating the marks of offense and merit, universally illuminating the ten directions" is the reward‑body; "the subtle and pure Dharma‑body" is the Dharma‑body; "with thirty‑two marks" is the response‑body. The three tracks have different names; in meaning they are the three bodies. Therefore the *Samantabhadra Contemplation* says: "The Buddha’s three kinds of bodies arise from the vaipulya." The *Treatise on Dharma‑realm Nature* says: "Mercury mixed with true gold can coat all colored images; merit mixed with the Dharma‑body responds and appears everywhere." If these three bodies are not vertical and not horizontal, subtle is determined—three bodies enter the Dharma‑body subtlety, through seven positions (and so on).

八、類通三涅槃者，地人言：「但有性淨、方便淨。實相名為性淨涅槃；修因所成為方便淨涅槃。」今以理性為性淨涅槃，修因所成為圓淨涅槃，此則義便；薪盡火滅為方便淨涅槃，此文便。若將修因所成為方便涅槃者，以薪盡火滅為何等涅槃？故知應有三涅槃，三涅槃即是三軌。文云：「是法不可示，言辭相寂滅。」又云：「諸法從本來，常自寂滅相。」是性淨涅槃。又云：「皆以如來滅度而滅度之」即圓淨涅槃。又云：「我成佛已來，甚大久遠。」久修業所得，慧光照無量，亦是圓淨涅槃。數數唱生，處處現滅，於此夜滅度，如薪盡火滅，豈非方便淨涅槃？《大經》題稱「大般涅槃」，翻為大滅度。大者，其性廣博，即據性淨。度者，到於彼岸，智慧滿足，即據圓淨。滅者，煩惱永盡，斷德成就，即據方便淨。此三涅槃，即是三軌也。

> 8. Classifying and penetrating the three nirvāṇas: the people of the ground say: "There is only nature‑purity and expedient‑purity. The real mark is named nature‑purity nirvāṇa; what is accomplished by cultivating causes is expedient‑purity nirvāṇa." Now taking principle‑nature as nature‑purity nirvāṇa and what is accomplished by cultivating causes as perfect‑purity nirvāṇa—this fits in meaning; taking fuel exhausted and fire extinguished as expedient‑purity nirvāṇa fits in wording. If one takes what is accomplished by cultivating causes as expedient nirvāṇa, then with fuel exhausted and fire extinguished, what nirvāṇa is that? Therefore one should know there are three nirvāṇas; the three nirvāṇas are the three tracks. The text says: "This dharma cannot be shown; the marks of words are quiescent and extinguished." It also says: "From the beginning, all dharmas are always quiescent and extinct in mark." This is nature‑purity nirvāṇa. It also says: "All are extinguished by the Tathāgata’s extinction"—this is perfect‑purity nirvāṇa. It also says: "Since I became Buddha, it has been very long." Long cultivation karma attained, wisdom light illumines immeasurably; this is also perfect‑purity nirvāṇa. Repeatedly proclaiming birth, manifesting extinction in every place, entering extinction on this night, like fuel exhausted and fire extinguished—is this not expedient‑purity nirvāṇa? The *Great Sutra* is titled "Great Nirvāṇa," translated as Great Extinction. Great: its nature is vast, thus based on nature‑purity. Extinction: afflictions are forever ended, the virtue of cutting is accomplished, thus based on expedient‑purity. Crossing over: reaching the other shore, wisdom is fulfilled, thus based on perfect‑purity. These three nirvāṇas are the three tracks.

九、類通一體三寶者，真性即法寶；觀照即佛寶；資成即僧寶。故法性不動名不覺；佛智契理，故佛名為覺。事和、理和，故僧名和合。《思益》云：「知覺名為佛；知離名為法；知無名為僧。」此是一體三寶。故下文云：「佛自[A1]住大乘」佛是佛寶；大乘是法寶；「如其所得法，以此度眾生。」即是與理和，復與眾生和，即是僧寶。「世間相常住」，名法寶；「於道場知已」，名佛寶；「導師方便說」上與理和，下與眾生和，名僧寶。一體三寶，非一之一，不三之三，此之三一，不縱不橫，稱之為妙。歷七位(云云)。

> 9. Classifying and penetrating the one‑essence three jewels: true nature is the Dharma jewel; contemplative illumination is the Buddha jewel; resource accomplishment is the Saṃgha jewel. Therefore dharma‑nature not moving is named non‑awakening; Buddha wisdom accords with principle, therefore Buddha is named awakening. Phenomena in harmony and principle in harmony, therefore the Saṃgha is named harmonious assembly. The *Siyi* says: "Knowing awakening is named Buddha; knowing separation is named Dharma; knowing no‑name is named Saṃgha." This is the one‑essence three jewels. Therefore the text below says: "The Buddha himself [A1] dwells in the Great Vehicle"—the Buddha is the Buddha jewel; the Great Vehicle is the Dharma jewel; "according to the dharma he has obtained, by this he ferries sentient beings"—this is harmony with principle and again harmony with sentient beings, which is the Saṃgha jewel. "The worldly marks are constantly abiding" is the Dharma jewel; "At the bodhimaṇḍa he has known it" is the Buddha jewel; "The guide speaks expediently" is harmony above with principle and below with sentient beings, named the Saṃgha jewel. The one‑essence three jewels are neither one of one nor three of three; this three‑and‑one is not vertical and not horizontal, named subtle. Through seven positions (and so on).

    [A1] 住【CB】，在【大】(cf. T09n0262_p0008a23; T33n1716_p0745a26)

> [A1] "住" [CB], "在" [Da] (cf. T09n0262_p0008a23; T33n1716_p0745a26)

十、類通三德者，《大經》三德，共成大涅槃。此經三軌，共成大乘。彼明法身德，此云實相。彼云：「佛性者亦一」一切眾生悉一乘故，亦是指實相為一乘。彼處明般若德；此經明其智慧門難解難入。「我所得智慧，微妙最第一」乃至「決了聲聞法，是諸經之王」皆是般若。彼經明解脫德；此經明數數示現，現生現滅，隨所調伏眾生之處，自既無累，令他解脫，乃至收取萬善事中功德悉得證果，豈非解脫？二經義合，碌碌之徒，隨名異解，譬聞天帝，不識憍尸。唯知《涅槃》佛性之文，不見雙樹有一乘之旨。彼文親說佛性亦一，一即一乘。而人云：「此乃《涅槃》一乘是佛性，《法華》一乘非佛性。」若言《法華》不明佛性者，《涅槃》不應遙指云：「八千聲聞於法華中，得受記莂，如秋收冬藏，見如來性，更無所作。」而人云：「《涅槃》有遙指之文，此中無佛性之語。」今據此文：「種種性相義，而我皆已見。」既言種種，何獨簡於佛性耶？又，「世間相常住。於道場知已，導師方便說。」豈非佛性之文耶？《論》云：「佛性水常不輕。」知眾生有佛性。又《涅槃》三德為祕密藏。安置諸子祕密藏中，我亦不久當入其中，此即自他俱入祕密。此經云：「佛自住大乘，以此度眾生。終不以小乘濟度諸眾生，悉以如來滅度而滅度之。」如是自他俱入如來滅度。滅度秖是涅槃，涅槃秖是祕藏。《釋論》云：「《法華》為祕藏，兩經文義宛宛恒同。」何故諸人，苟欲抗異？若文義舛隔，作同想無罪，今文義本合，離之何福？但《涅槃》以佛性為宗，非不明一乘義；今經以一乘為宗，非不明佛性義。赴機異說，其義常通也。若三德縱橫即是麁；不縱橫即是妙。歷七位(云云)。

> 10. Classifying and penetrating the three virtues: the *Great Sutra*’s three virtues together complete great nirvāṇa; this sūtra’s three tracks together complete the Great Vehicle. There it clarifies the virtue of the Dharma‑body; here it says real mark. There it says: "Buddha‑nature is also one"—because all sentient beings are entirely one vehicle, which also points to the real mark as the one vehicle. There it clarifies the virtue of prajñā; this sūtra clarifies that its wisdom gate is hard to understand and hard to enter. "The wisdom I have attained is subtle and most first" up to "decisively clarifying the Śrāvaka dharma, it is the king of all sūtras"—all are prajñā. There it clarifies the virtue of liberation; this sūtra clarifies repeated manifestation—manifesting birth and manifesting extinction, according to the places where sentient beings are tamed; oneself already without burden, causing others to be liberated; up to collecting the merits within the myriad good deeds and all attain fruit—how is that not liberation? The meanings of the two sūtras accord, yet the plodding fellows, following names, interpret differently, like hearing of the Heavenly Emperor but not recognizing Kauśika. They only know the *Nirvāṇa*’s text of Buddha‑nature and do not see that the Twin Trees have the intent of the one vehicle. That text directly says Buddha‑nature is also one; one is precisely one vehicle. Yet people say: "In the *Nirvāṇa*, the one vehicle is Buddha‑nature; in the *Lotus*, the one vehicle is not Buddha‑nature." If one says the *Lotus* does not clarify Buddha‑nature, the *Nirvāṇa* should not have pointed from afar saying: "Eight thousand śrāvakas in the *Lotus* receive prediction, like autumn harvest and winter storage; they see the Tathāgata nature and have nothing more to do." Yet people say: "The *Nirvāṇa* has a distant‑pointing text; here there is no Buddha‑nature language." Now, based on this text: "The meanings of various natures and marks, I have all seen"—since it says various, why especially exclude Buddha‑nature? Also, "The worldly marks are constantly abiding. At the bodhimaṇḍa he has known it. The guide speaks expediently." Is this not the text of Buddha‑nature? The *Śāstra* says: "The Buddha‑nature water always does not slight." This is knowing that sentient beings have Buddha‑nature. Also, the *Nirvāṇa*’s three virtues are the secret store: placing the children in the secret store, I too will soon enter it—this is self and others together entering the secret. This sūtra says: "The Buddha himself dwells in the Great Vehicle; by this he ferries sentient beings. He never uses the small vehicle to ferry sentient beings; he entirely uses Tathāgata extinction to extinguish them." Thus self and others together enter the Tathāgata’s extinction. Extinction is only nirvāṇa; nirvāṇa is only the secret store. The *Śāstra* says: "The *Lotus* is the secret store; the two sūtras’ words and meanings are always entirely the same." Why do people, if only wanting to contend differences? If words and meanings were divergent, thinking them the same would be no fault; now words and meanings are originally united—what blessing is there in separating them? But the *Nirvāṇa* takes Buddha‑nature as its principal; it is not that it does not clarify one‑vehicle meaning. This sūtra takes the one vehicle as its principal; it is not that it does not clarify Buddha‑nature meaning. Adapting to capacities, they speak differently; the meaning is always shared. If the three virtues are vertical and horizontal, that is coarse; if not vertical or horizontal, that is subtle. Through seven positions (and so on).

七、悉檀料簡者。

> Seventh, siddhānta analysis and discrimination.

問：

> Question:

十種三法及餘一切皆是三軌者，唯應三軌，何意異說？

> If the ten kinds of three dharmas and all others are the three tracks, they should only be the three tracks; why are there different explanations?

答：

> Answer:

眾生機宜不同，應隨機設逗，悉檀方便引接耳。隨俗故異，稱便宜故異，逐對治故異，令人入道故異。朝三暮四，撫眾狙而皆悅，苦塗水洗，養嬰兒以適時。善巧赴機，故方圓任物，譬千車而同轍，豈守一而疑諸？

> Sentient beings’ capacities and appropriateness differ; one should set teachings according to the capacities—siddhānta expedients to draw them in. They differ because of following conventions; differ because they are called according to convenience; differ because they are aimed at antidotes; differ because they lead people into the path. "Three in the morning, four in the evening"—stroking the many monkeys and all are pleased; washing the bitter smears with water; raising an infant according to the time. Skillfully meeting capacities, therefore square or round is left to the object; like a thousand carts sharing the same ruts—how could one hold to one and doubt the rest?

今通用四悉檀，歷十法，論妙，不妙；具說三軌，共成大乘。大乘之中，備有三法及一切法，不相混亂，即是世界悉檀。資成資發智慧，以生善故，是為人悉檀。觀照破惑，諸惡滅故，是對治悉檀。真性實理，為第一義悉檀。一段眾生，宜以大乘名說，得四利益也。

> Now generally using the four siddhāntas and passing through the ten dharmas, we discuss subtle and not subtle; fully explaining the three tracks, together completing the Great Vehicle. Within the Great Vehicle, the three dharmas and all dharmas are fully present and not confused with each other—this is the world‑siddhānta. Resource accomplishment supports and gives rise to wisdom, producing good; this is the individual‑siddhānta. Contemplative illumination breaks delusion and various evils are extinguished; this is the antidote‑siddhānta. True nature is real principle; this is the supreme‑meaning siddhānta. One segment of beings should be named and taught as the Great Vehicle and obtain the four benefits.

備說三德為大涅槃。雖三點上下而無縱、表裏而無橫，一不相混，三不相離，即世界悉檀。善利殃釁不干，故得挺然累表，是故解脫即為人悉檀。般若如金剛，隨所擬皆碎，即是對治悉檀。法身即第一義也。一段眾生聞三德名，即獲四利矣！舉初、舉後、中間例然。

> Fully explaining the three virtues as great nirvāṇa: though the three dots are above and below yet without vertical, inside and outside yet without horizontal; one does not mix with each other, three do not separate—this is the world‑siddhānta. Good and harm, calamity and blessing do not interfere, therefore it stands forth above the surface of entanglements; therefore liberation is the individual‑siddhānta. Prajñā is like a vajra; whatever it strikes is shattered—this is the antidote‑siddhānta. The Dharma‑body is the supreme meaning. A segment of beings hearing the names of the three virtues immediately obtains the four benefits. Taking the first and taking the last, the middle is likewise.

次、明妙不妙。《論》云：「三悉檀是世諦，心所行處，可破可壞。第一義悉檀，是心不行處，諸佛聖人心所得法，不可破壞，即是真諦。」若然者，比四悉檀為二諦所攝。更有中道，復云何攝？若不攝中，但是藏、通之意，此悉檀為麁。今言俗有、真無，是隔異法，便是三悉檀心所行處，可破可壞。中道第一義，非有、非無，有無不二則無隔異，無異即真諦。前三悉檀所通，止至化城，化城非實，故可破可壞，可壞為麁。今中道無異，又通至寶所，無能過、無能滅，故不可壞，稱之為妙。若餘經說中道第一義悉檀，與此經不殊。但餘經帶阿羅漢所得，為第一義悉檀，故不稱妙。此經正直捨方便，但有圓實四悉檀，是故為妙。若不決三悉檀入第一義，是復為麁；若決一一悉檀，皆有第一義者，是則為妙。

> Next, clarifying subtle and not subtle. The *Śāstra* says: "The three siddhāntas are worldly truth, the place the mind acts; they can be broken and destroyed. The supreme‑meaning siddhānta is where the mind does not act; the dharma obtained by the minds of Buddhas and sages cannot be broken—this is true truth." If so, comparing the four siddhāntas to be encompassed by the two truths; but there is also the middle way—how is it encompassed? If the middle is not encompassed, that is the meaning of the Tripiṭaka and Common [teachings]; these siddhāntas are coarse. Now saying the conventional exists and the true does not is a separated dharma; then it is the three siddhāntas as the mind’s acting place, breakable and destructible. The middle‑way supreme meaning is neither existence nor non‑existence; existence and non‑existence being non‑dual, there is no separation; no separation is true truth. What the first three siddhāntas penetrate only reaches the conjured city; the conjured city is not real, thus it can be broken and destroyed; being breakable is coarse. Now the middle way has no separation and also reaches the treasure place; there is nothing that can surpass it and nothing that can destroy it, thus it cannot be broken, named subtle. If other sūtras speak of the middle‑way supreme‑meaning siddhānta, it is not different from this sūtra. But other sūtras bring in what arhats attain as the supreme‑meaning siddhānta, therefore it is not called subtle. This sūtra directly and straightforwardly abandons expedients, and only has the perfect real four siddhāntas; therefore it is subtle. If one does not determine the three siddhāntas to enter the supreme meaning, it is again coarse; if one determines that each and every siddhānta has the supreme meaning, that is subtle.

五品弟子，假名四悉檀。六根淨，相似四悉檀。初住至等覺，分真四悉檀。妙覺，究竟四悉檀，是故稱妙。

> The five‑grade disciples: name‑only four siddhāntas. Six‑root purity: resemblance four siddhāntas. From first abode to equal‑awakening: partial‑true four siddhāntas. Subtle awakening: ultimate four siddhāntas; therefore it is called subtle.

此五番明妙，從因至果，以辨自行妙，半如意珠竟。

> These five rounds clarifying subtlety, from cause to fruit, distinguish the subtlety of self‑practice; the half wish‑fulfilling jewel is finished.
