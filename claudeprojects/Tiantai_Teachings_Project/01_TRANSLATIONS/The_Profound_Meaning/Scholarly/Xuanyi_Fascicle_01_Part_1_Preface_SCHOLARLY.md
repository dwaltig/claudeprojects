### [1] On the Unparalleled Virtue of Master Zhiyi

大法東漸，《僧史》所載，詎有幾人不曾聽講，自解佛乘者乎？

> When the Great Dharma flowed eastward, as recorded in the *Histories of the Saṅgha*—how many were there who, never having attended a lecture, attained understanding of the Buddha Vehicle on their own?

縱令發悟，復能入定得陀羅尼者不？

> Even granting such awakening, could any then enter samādhi and attain dhāraṇī?[^1]

縱具定慧，復帝京弘二法不？

> Even possessing both concentration (*samādhi*) and wisdom (*prajñā*), did any then propagate the Two Dharmas[^2] in the Imperial Capital?

縱令盛席，謝遣徒眾隱居山谷不？

> Even with flourishing assemblies, did any then dismiss their disciples and seclude themselves in mountain valleys?

縱避世守玄，被徵為二國師不？

> Even while shunning the world and guarding the profound, were any then summoned to serve as National Preceptor to two dynasties?[^3]

縱帝者所尊，太極對御講《仁王般若》不？

> Even being honored by emperors, did any then expound the *Renwang Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra* in the Tàijí Hall before the sovereign?

縱正殿宣揚，為主上三禮不？

> Even proclaiming the Dharma in the main hall, did any receive the Three Prostrations from the ruler?

縱令萬乘屈膝，百高座百官稱美讚歎，彈指喧殿不？

> Even having the Emperor of Ten Thousand Chariots bend his knee, did a hundred high seats and a hundred officials voice praise and admiration, snapping their fingers until the hall resounded?

縱道俗顒顒，玄悟《法華》圓意不？

> Even with monastics and laity in reverent attention, did any profoundly awaken to the Perfect Meaning of the Lotus Sutra?

縱得經意，能無文字，以樂說辯，晝夜流瀉不？

> Even having grasped the sūtra's meaning, could any transcend written words and, with the eloquence of joyful speech, pour forth teaching day and night without cease?

**唯我智者，具諸功德。**

> **Only our Master Zhiyi fully possessed all these virtues.**

### [2] Guanding's Personal Testimony

幸哉灌頂，昔於建業，始聽經文；次在江陵，奉蒙玄義；晚還台嶺，仍值鶴林。

> How fortunate I, Guanding! Long ago in Jiànye,[^4] I first heard the textual teachings. Later in Jiānglíng, I was graced to receive the *Profound Meaning*. In my later years, returning to Mount Tiantai, I was present for the Crane Grove.[^5]

荊揚往復，途將萬里，前後補接，纔聞一遍。

> Traveling back and forth between Jing and Yang,[^6] a journey of nearly ten thousand *li*, piecing together teachings from before and after—I barely managed to hear [the complete exposition] once through.

非但未聞不聞，亦乃聞者未了，卷舒鑽仰，彌覺堅高，猶恨緣淺，不再不三，諮詢無地，如犢思乳。

> It is not merely that what I had not heard remained unheard; even what I did hear remained incomprehensible. Rolling and unrolling [the text], studying and contemplating, I became ever more aware of its solidity and loftiness. Yet I lamented my shallow karmic connection—unable to ask a second or third time, with no place to make inquiry—like a calf longing for milk.

並復惟念：斯言若墜，將來可悲。

> Moreover, I thought: "If these words should be lost, future generations would be pitiable indeed."

《涅槃》明若樹若石，今經稱若田若里，聿遵聖典，書而傳之，《玄》、《文》各十卷。

> The *Nirvāṇa Sūtra* speaks of [inscribing the Dharma on] trees and stones; this present sūtra speaks of [planting seeds in] fields and villages.[^7] Following the holy scriptures, I have written them down to transmit them—the *Profound Meaning* and the *Textual Commentary*, each in ten fascicles.

或以經論誠言，符此深妙；或標諸師異解，驗彼非圓。後代行者，知甘露門之在茲。

> Some [sections] use the sincere words of sūtras and śāstras to accord with this profound and wonderful [teaching]; others mark the divergent interpretations of various masters, verifying that those are not the Perfect [doctrine]. Practitioners of future generations will know that the Gate of Sweet Dew[^8] is found herein.

### [3] Explanation of "Myō" (妙)

所言「妙」者，「妙」名不可思議也。

> What is meant by "Myō" (Wonderful)? The name "Myō" signifies *the inconceivable*.

所言「法」者，十界、十如、權實之法也。

> What is meant by "Dharma"? It is the Dharma of the Ten Dharma-Realms, the Ten Suchnesses, and the Provisional and Real.[^10]

「蓮華」者，譬權實法也。

> "Lotus Flower" is a metaphor for the Dharma of Provisional and Real.

良以妙法難解，假喻易彰！

> Since the Wonderful Dharma is difficult to understand, metaphors make it manifest!

況意乃多，略擬前後，合成六也。

> Moreover, the meanings are many; briefly comparing the preceding and following, they combine into six.[^11]

---

### [4] The Six-Fold Lotus Metaphor: Trace Gate (迹門)

**一、為蓮故華，譬為實施權。**

> **First: "The flower exists for the sake of the lotus"—this metaphors *granting the Provisional for the sake of the Real*.**

文云「知第一寂滅，以方便力故，雖示種種道，其實為佛乘。」

> The text says: "Knowing the supreme extinction, yet through the power of skillful means, though he shows various paths, they are truly for the Buddha Vehicle."[^12]

**二、華敷譬開權，蓮現譬顯實。**

> **Second: "The flower blooming" metaphors *Opening the Provisional*; "The lotus appearing" metaphors *Revealing the Real*.**

文云「開方便門，示真實相。」

> The text says: "Open the gate of skillful means, and reveal the marks of true reality."[^13]

**三、華落譬廢權，蓮成譬立實。**

> **Third: "The flower falling" metaphors *Abolishing the Provisional*; "The lotus maturing" metaphors *Establishing the Real*.**

文云「正直捨方便，但說無上道。」

> The text says: "Setting aside skillful means directly, he teaches only the unsurpassed Way."[^14]

---

### [5] The Six-Fold Lotus Metaphor: Fundamental Gate (本門)

又蓮譬於本，華譬於迹，從本垂迹，迹依於本。

> Again: the *lotus* metaphors the *Fundamental* (本); the *flower* metaphors the *Trace* (迹). From the Fundamental, the Trace descends; the Trace depends upon the Fundamental.

文云「我實成佛來，久遠若斯。但教化眾生，作如是說：『我少出家，得三菩提。』」

> The text says: "In truth, since I attained Buddhahood, it has been this long. But to teach and convert sentient beings, I spoke thus: 'In my youth I left home and attained the three kinds of bodhi.'"[^15]

**二、華敷譬開迹，蓮現譬顯本。**

> **Second: "The flower blooming" metaphors *Opening the Trace*; "The lotus appearing" metaphors *Revealing the Fundamental*.**

文云「一切世間皆謂今始得道；我成佛來，無量無邊那由他劫。」

> The text says: "All the world thought I had just now attained the Way; [but] since I became Buddha, it has been immeasurable, boundless nayutas of kalpas."[^16]

**三、華落譬廢迹，蓮成譬立本。**

> **Third: "The flower falling" metaphors *Abolishing the Trace*; "The lotus maturing" metaphors *Establishing the Fundamental*.**

文云「諸佛如來，法皆如是。為度眾生，皆實不虛。」

> The text says: "All Buddha Tathāgatas—their Dharmas are all thus. For the sake of saving sentient beings, all is real and not false."[^17]

---

### [6] Summary of the Lotus Metaphor

是以先標妙法，次喻蓮華：蕩化城之執教，廢草庵之滯情；開方便之權門，示真實之妙理；會眾善之小行，歸廣大之一乘；上、中、下根，皆與記莂。

> Therefore, first the Wonderful Dharma is proclaimed, then the Lotus Flower is employed as metaphor: to sweep away the fixed teaching of the Conjured City,[^18] to abolish the stagnant attachments of the Grass Hut;[^19] to open the Provisional gate of skillful means, to reveal the wonderful principle of true reality; to integrate the small practices of various goods, returning them to the vast and great One Vehicle; beings of superior, middling, and inferior capacities—all receive the bestowal of prediction.

又發眾聖之權巧，顯本地之幽微，故增道損生，位隣大覺。

> Again, he manifests the expedient skill of the many Sages, revealing the subtle profundity of the Original Ground. Therefore, the Way increases and [transmigration in] birth diminishes; one's stage approaches the Great Awakening.

一期化導，事理俱圓，蓮華之譬，意在斯矣。

> In the single period of guiding transformation, both phenomena and principle are perfectly complete. The meaning of the Lotus Flower metaphor lies herein.

---

### [7] On "Sūtra" (經)

「經」者，外國稱修多羅，聖教之都名。有翻、無翻，事如後釋。

> "Sūtra" (*Jīng*)—in foreign lands it is called *sūtra* (*xiūduōluó*, Skt. *sūtra*)—is the general name for the holy teachings. Whether translated or untranslated, the matter is as explained later.

---

## Commentary by the Recorder (Guanding)

記者釋曰：蓋「序王」者，敘經玄意。

> The Recorder's explanation: The "Xù Wáng" expounds the profound meaning of the sūtra.

玄意述於文心，文心莫過迹本。

> The profound meaning is expressed through the heart of the text; the heart of the text is none other than the Trace and the Fundamental.

仰觀斯旨，眾義冷然。

> Looking up at this purport, the multitude of meanings becomes crystal clear.

妙法蓮華，即敘名也；示真實之妙理，敘體也；歸廣大之一乘，敘宗也；蕩化城之執教，敘用也；一期化圓，敘教也；六譬，敘迹本也。文略意周矣。

> "Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower" expounds the *Name*. "Revealing the wonderful principle of true reality" expounds the *Substance*. "Returning to the vast and great One Vehicle" expounds the *Essence*. "Sweeping away the fixed teaching of the Conjured City" expounds the *Function*. "The single period of transformation is perfectly complete" expounds the *Teaching*. The six metaphors expound the Trace and Fundamental. The text is concise, yet the meaning is complete.

## Private Preface to the King (私序王)

私序王

> Private Preface to the King.

夫理絕偏圓，寄圓珠而談理；極非遠近，託寶所而論極。

> As for principle, it is beyond partial and perfect; one relies on the round jewel to speak of principle. The ultimate is neither far nor near; one relies on the Treasure‑Place to speak of the ultimate.

極會圓冥，事理俱寂。

> The ultimate and the perfect meet in mysterious stillness; phenomena and principle are both quiescent.

而不寂者，良由耽無明酒，雖繫珠而不覺；迷涅槃道，路弗遠而言長。

> Yet that which is not quiescent is due to being intoxicated by the wine of ignorance: though the jewel is tied on, one does not perceive it; one is deluded about the path of nirvāṇa—though the road is not far, one says it is long.

聖主世尊！

> O holy sovereign, World‑Honored One!

愍斯倒惑，四華六動，開方便之門，三變千踊，表真實之地，咸令一切普得見聞。

> Out of compassion for these inverted delusions, [you caused] four flowers and six tremors, opening the gate of skillful means; three transformations and a thousand upheavals display the ground of true reality, causing all to universally gain seeing and hearing.

發祕密之奧藏，稱之為妙。

> Revealing the profound treasury of the secret is called “Wonderful.”

示權實之正軌，故號為法。

> Showing the correct track of the Provisional and Real is therefore called “Dharma.”

指久遠之本果，喻之以蓮。

> Pointing to the original fruit of the far‑distant past, it is metaphorized by the lotus.

會不二之圓道，譬之以華。

> Uniting the non‑dual perfect path, it is metaphorized by the flower.

聲為佛事，稱之為經。

> The voice is the Buddha’s work; it is called “Sūtra.”

圓詮之初，目之為序。

> The beginning of the perfect exposition is named “Preface.”

序類相從，稱之為品。

> The preface and its kindred follow one another; it is called a “Chapter.”

眾次之首，名為第一。

> As the first among the ordered series, it is named “First.”

釋曰：談記是敘名；會冥是敘體；圓珠是敘宗；俱寂是敘用；四華六動是敘教，本迹可知。

> Explanation: “recording in speech” narrates the Name; “meeting in mystery” narrates the Substance; the round jewel narrates the Essence; “both quiescent” narrates the Function; the four flowers and six tremors narrate the Teaching; thus the trace and fundamental can be known.

此《妙法蓮華經》者，本地甚深之奧藏也。

> This *Lotus Sūtra* is the profoundly deep secret treasury of the original ground.

文云「是法不可示，世間相常住。」

> The text says, “This dharma cannot be shown; the marks of the world are eternally abiding.”

三世如來之所證得也。

> This is what the Tathāgatas of the three times have realized.

文云「是第一寂滅於道場知已，大事因緣出現於世。」

> The text says, “Knowing the supreme extinction at the place of awakening, [the Buddha] appears in the world for the great cause and conditions.”

始見我身，令入佛慧。

> He first reveals my body, causing [beings] to enter Buddha‑wisdom.

為未入者，四十餘年，以異方便，助顯第一義。

> For those not yet entered, for more than forty years he used different skillful means to assist in revealing the First Principle.

今正直捨方便，但說無上道。

> Now he directly sets aside skillful means and teaches only the unsurpassed Way.

所言妙者，褒美不可思議之法也。

> What is called “Wonderful” is praise for the inconceivable Dharma.

又妙者，十法界、十如之法。

> Moreover, “Wonderful” is the dharmas of the Ten Dharma‑Realms and the Ten Suchnesses.

此法即妙，此妙即法，無二無別，故言妙也。

> This Dharma is itself Wonderful; this Wonderful is itself Dharma—non‑dual and undifferentiated—therefore it is called Wonderful.

又妙者，自行權實之法妙也，故舉蓮華而況之也。

> Moreover, “Wonderful” means the wondrous Dharma of self‑practice in Provisional and Real; therefore the lotus is raised as a metaphor.

又妙者，即迹而本，即本而迹，即非本非迹，或為開廢(云云)。

> Moreover, “Wonderful” is: the trace is the fundamental, the fundamental is the trace; it is neither fundamental nor trace; or it is opening or abolishing (etc.).

又妙者，最勝脩多羅甘露之門，故言妙也。

> Moreover, “Wonderful” is the gate of the most supreme sūtra, the sweet‑dew gate; therefore it is called Wonderful.

釋曰：妙無別體，體上褒美者，敘妙名也。

> Explanation: Wonderful has no separate substance; praising it upon the substance narrates the Wonderful Name.

妙即法界，法界即妙者，敘體也。

> Wonderful is the Dharma‑realm; the Dharma‑realm is Wonderful—this narrates the Substance.

自行權實者，敘宗也。

> Self‑practice in Provisional and Real narrates the Essence.

本迹六喻者，敘用也。

> The six metaphors of fundamental and trace narrate the Function.

甘露門者，敘教也。

> The sweet‑dew gate narrates the Teaching.
