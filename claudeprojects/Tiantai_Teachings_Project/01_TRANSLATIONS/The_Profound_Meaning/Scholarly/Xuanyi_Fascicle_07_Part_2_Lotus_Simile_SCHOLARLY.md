## △次、釋蓮華
# Explaining "Lotus Flower"

---

### Four Topics

為四意：一、定法譬。二、引舊釋。三、出經論。四、正解釋。

> This has **four topics**:
> 1. Determining dharma and metaphor
> 2. Citing old explanations
> 3. Producing sūtra-and-śāstra [evidence]
> 4. Proper explanation

---

## Part 1: Is "Lotus Flower" Dharma or Metaphor?

定法譬者，權實難顯，借喻蓮華，譬於妙法。

> Determining dharma and metaphor: **Expedient and real are difficult to reveal**, so we borrow the simile of the lotus to metaphorize the subtle dharma.

又七喻文多，故以譬標題。

> Also, because the seven parables [in the sūtra] have extensive text, **we use metaphor to mark the title**.

---

### The Alternative View: Lotus as Dharma Itself

又解云：蓮華非譬，當體得名。

> Another explanation says: **The lotus is not a metaphor—it gets its name from [being] the thing itself.**

類如劫初，萬物無名，聖人觀理，準則作名：如蛛羅引絲，倣之結網；蓬飛獨運，依而造車...

> Like at the beginning of the kalpa when myriad things had no names, sages observed principle and made names accordingly: Like a spider drawing silk, one imitated it to make nets; like tumbleweeds flying independently, one relied on them to make carts...

今蓮華之稱，非是假喻，乃是法華法門；法華法門清淨，因果微妙，名此法門為蓮華，即是法華三昧當體之名，非譬喻也。

> Now the name "lotus" **is not a borrowed metaphor—it is the Lotus Dharma-Gate**. The Lotus Dharma-Gate is pure, cause and fruit are subtle—**this dharma-gate is named "Lotus"**—it is the essential name of the Lotus Samādhi, not a simile.

---

### Master Zhiyi's Synthesis

今融二意。

> Now I **fuse both meanings**.

利根即名解理，不假譬喻，但作法華之解。中、下未悟，須譬乃知，以易解之蓮華，喻難解之蓮華。

> **Sharp-rooted** people understand principle from the name directly, not needing metaphor—they simply make the Lotus interpretation. **Middle and lower** [roots] haven't awakened yet—they need metaphor to know. Use the **easily understood lotus** to metaphorize the **hard-to-understand Lotus**.

約上根是法名，約中、下是譬名；三根合論，雙標法譬。

> For upper roots it's a **dharma-name**; for middle and lower roots it's a **metaphor-name**. Combining three roots, we **double-mark it as both dharma and metaphor**.

---

## Part 2: Classical Names

叡師序云：「未敷名屈摩羅，將落名迦摩羅，處中盛時名分陀利。」

> Master Rui's preface says: "**Before opening, it's called kumuda; about to fall, it's called kamala; at its full prime, it's called puṇḍarīka.**"

遠師云：分陀利伽是蓮華開喻，然體逐時，遷名隨色變，故有三名也。

> Master Yuan says: Puṇḍarīka is the open-lotus metaphor. But the body follows time, names change with color—hence three names.

### The *Treatise*'s Two Meanings of Lotus

今解論意，若言令眾生見淨妙法身者，此以妙因開發為蓮華也。若言入如來大眾坐蓮華上者，此以妙報國土為蓮華也。

> Understanding the Treatise's meaning: If it says "causing beings to see the pure subtle Dharma-body," **this takes subtle cause's opening-and-developing as lotus**. If it says "entering among the Tathāgata's great assembly, sitting on a lotus," **this takes the subtle reward-land as lotus**.

## Part 4: Comprehensive Lotus Simile

### Three Metaphors for the Trace Gate

一、華生必有於蓮，為蓮而華，蓮不可見，此譬約實明權、意在於實，無能知者。

> **First**: When a flower grows, there must be a lotus. The flower is for the lotus, [but] the lotus cannot be seen. This metaphorizes **basing expedient on real, intent on the real, unknowable by any**.

二、華開故蓮現，而須華養蓮，譬權中有實，而不能知。今開權顯實，意須於權，廣識恒沙佛法者，秖為成實，使深識佛知見耳。

> **Second**: Because the flower opens, the lotus appears—yet the flower must nourish the lotus. This metaphorizes **real within expedient, yet not cognizable**. Now opening expedient to reveal real—the intent is on expedient. Broadly knowing sand-grain Buddha-dharmas is simply to complete the real, causing deep knowledge of Buddha's knowledge-and-vision.

三、華落蓮成，即喻廢三顯一，唯一佛乘直至道場。

> **Third**: Flower falls, lotus forms—this metaphorizes **abandoning three to reveal one**—only One Buddha Vehicle going straight to the bodhi-site.

---

### Three Metaphors for the Fundamental Gate

一、華必有蓮，譬迹必有本，迹含於本。意雖在本，佛旨難知，彌勒不識。

> **First**: A flower must have a lotus—this metaphorizes **Trace must have Fundamental**, Trace contains Fundamental. Though intent is on Fundamental, Buddha's purport is hard to know—Maitreya doesn't recognize it.

二、華開蓮現，譬開迹顯本，意在於迹。能令菩薩識佛方便，既識迹已，還識於本，增道損生。

> **Second**: Flower opens, lotus appears—this metaphorizes **opening Trace to reveal Fundamental**—intent is on Trace. Able to make bodhisattvas recognize Buddha's skillful means; having recognized Trace, they return to recognize Fundamental, increasing path and decreasing birth.

三、華落蓮成，譬廢迹顯本。既識本已不復迷迹，但於法身修道，圓滿上地也。

> **Third**: Flower falls, lotus forms—this metaphorizes **abandoning Trace to reveal Fundamental**. Having recognized Fundamental, one no longer confuses Trace; simply cultivating the path in Dharma-body, completing upper grounds perfectly.

## The Lotus Simile Applied to Ten Suchnesses

蓮華譬十如境。

> **The lotus metaphorizes the Ten Suchnesses realm**:

| Suchness | Lotus Element |
|----------|---------------|
| **Such-Mark** | Lotus seed's black indestructible shell—pure mind |
| **Such-Nature** | White flesh inside—wisdom-nature |
| **Such-Body** | Four elements not decaying—Buddha-nature body |
| **Such-Power** | Curled heart with growth energy—bodhicitta power |
| **Such-Activity** | Complete with root, stem, flower, leaf—initial bodhicitta activity |
| **Such-Cause** | Growing from mud to air—true cause |
| **Such-Condition** | Stamen surrounding lotus inside flower—myriad practices |
| **Such-Fruit** | Flower forms lotus, petals fall, fruit ripens—great fruit |
| **Such-Reward** | Pod encasing seeds—habit-fruit |
| **Such-Ultimate** | Four elements in mud = four elements in air—original-end equality |

---

## The Lotus Simile Applied to All Ten Subtleties

Master Zhiyi extends the lotus metaphor to each subtlety:

| Subtlety | Lotus Element |
|----------|---------------|
| **Wisdom** | Inner growth nature |
| **Practice** | Stem = compassion, leaf = wisdom, stamen = samādhi |
| **Position** | Sprouting, emerging from mud, in water, in air = various stages |
| **Three Dharmas** | Four elements = True Nature; hollow center = Contemplative Illumination |
| **Resonance** | Shadow in clear water = manifest response; shadow in murky water = hidden |
| **Supernatural Powers** | Swaying in wind = ground-shaking; closing at night = entering samādhi |
| **Dharma-Exposition** | Closed = hidden One Vehicle; open = revealed One Vehicle |
| **Retinue** | New lotus from root = karma-born; from seed = vow-born |
| **Benefits** | Fish and turtles below, bees above = fruit benefits; gathering leaves = cause |

---

## Concluding Application

如是等譬及餘無量譬喻，以譬迹中十妙...本初修因證果已竟，為眾生故更起方便，在生死中，示初發心，復示究竟。

> **These metaphors and immeasurable others metaphorize the Trace's Ten Subtleties**... Originally cultivating cause and realizing fruit was already complete; for sentient beings' sake, [Buddha] further arises skillful means, in birth-and-death showing initial aspiration and again showing ultimate completion.

若非蓮華，何由遍喻上來諸法？法、譬雙辨，故稱妙法蓮華也。

> **If not for the lotus, by what means could we universally metaphorize all the above dharmas? Dharma and metaphor doubly distinguished—hence called "Subtle Dharma Lotus Flower."**

---

## Footnotes

[^1]: The **comprehensive lotus simile** is one of Master Zhiyi's masterpieces of hermeneutics. Every aspect of the lotus—from seed to decay—maps onto Buddhist doctrine. The lotus is both dharma itself (for sharp roots) and metaphor (for middle/lower roots).
