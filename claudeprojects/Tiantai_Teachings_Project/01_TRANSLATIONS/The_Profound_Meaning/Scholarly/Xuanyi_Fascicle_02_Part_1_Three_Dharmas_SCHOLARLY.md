## Introduction to the Detailed Interpretation

四、正論今意，為二：先、略用彼名顯於妙義。

> **Fourth, the correct discussion of the present meaning** has two parts: first, briefly using those names to reveal the wonderful meaning.

---

### The Three Meanings of Cause (因)

因具三義者：

> **Cause possesses three meanings:**

一法界具九法界，名體廣。

> 1. One Dharma-Realm contains the nine Dharma-Realms—this is called **breadth of substance** (體廣).

九法界即佛法界，名位高。

> 2. The nine Dharma-Realms are precisely the Buddha Dharma-Realm—this is called **height of position** (位高).

十法界即空、即假、即中，名用長。

> 3. The Ten Dharma-Realms are precisely emptiness, precisely provisional, precisely the Middle—this is called **length of function** (用長).

即一而論三，即三而論一，非各異，亦非橫，亦非一，故稱妙也。

> Discussing three in terms of one, discussing one in terms of three—neither separately different, nor horizontal, nor singular—therefore it is called **Wonderful**.

---

### The Three Meanings of Fruit (果)

果體具三義者，體遍一切處，名體廣。久已成佛久遠久遠，名位高。從本垂迹，過、現、未來三世益物，名用長。

> **The substance of fruit possesses three meanings:**
> - Substance pervades all places—**breadth of substance**.
> - [The Buddha] has long since attained Buddhahood, remotely remote—**height of position**.
> - From the Fundamental, the Trace descends; past, present, and future—benefiting beings in the three times—**length of function**.

是為因果六義，異於餘經，是故稱妙。

> These are the **six meanings of cause and effect**, different from other sūtras. Therefore it is called **Wonderful**.

---

## The Five Flavors and Cause/Effect

又乳經一種因果廣、高、長，一種因果狹、下、短，則一麁一妙(云云)。

> In the **Milk Teaching** (*Avataṃsaka*), one kind of cause-and-effect is broad, high, and long; one kind is narrow, low, and short—thus one coarse, one wonderful.[^1]

酪經唯一種因果狹、下、短，但麁無妙。

> In the **Curds Teaching** (*Tripiṭaka*), there is only one kind of cause-and-effect: narrow, low, and short—only coarse, no wonderful.

生蘇經三種因果狹、下、短，一種因果廣、高、長，則三麁一妙。

> In the **Fresh Butter Teaching** (*Vaipulya*), three kinds are narrow, low, short; one kind is broad, high, long—thus three coarse, one wonderful.

熟蘇經二種因果狹、下、短，一種因果廣、高、長，則二麁一妙。

> In the **Clarified Butter Teaching** (*Prajñā*), two kinds are narrow, low, short; one kind is broad, high, long—thus two coarse, one wonderful.

醍醐經一種因果廣、高、長，但妙無麁。

> In the **Ghee Teaching** (*Lotus*), there is one kind of cause-and-effect: broad, high, and long—**only wonderful, no coarse**.

又醍醐經妙因、妙果，與諸經妙因、妙果不異，故稱為妙也。

> Moreover, in the Ghee Teaching, the wonderful cause and wonderful fruit do not differ from the wonderful cause and fruit of other sūtras—therefore it is called **Wonderful**.

---

## Observing the Mind (觀心)

復次觀心釋。若觀己心不具眾生心、佛心者，是體狹；具者是體廣。

> **Furthermore, the interpretation through Observing the Mind:** If one contemplates one's own mind and [finds that] it does not contain the minds of sentient beings and the Buddha-mind, this is **narrow substance**. If it contains them, this is **broad substance**.

若己心不等佛心是位下；若等佛心是位高。

> If one's own mind is not equal to the Buddha-mind, this is **low position**. If equal to the Buddha-mind, this is **high position**.

若己心、眾生心、佛心，不即空、即假、即中者，是用短；即空、即假、即中者，是用長。

> If one's own mind, sentient beings' minds, and the Buddha-mind are not precisely empty, precisely provisional, precisely the Middle, this is **short function**. If they are precisely empty, precisely provisional, precisely the Middle, this is **long function**.

---

### The Four Unities

復次，於一法界通達十法界六即位者，亦是體廣，亦是位高，亦是用長。

> Furthermore, penetrating the Ten Dharma-Realms and the Six Stages of Identity within one Dharma-Realm—this is also breadth of substance, height of position, and length of function.

初約十法界，是顯理一；次約五味，是約教一；次約觀心，是約行一；次約六即，是約人一。略示妙義竟。

> - First, in terms of the Ten Dharma-Realms—this reveals **unity of principle** (理一).
> - Second, in terms of the Five Flavors—this is **unity of teaching** (教一).
> - Third, in terms of Observing the Mind—this is **unity of practice** (行一).
> - Fourth, in terms of the Six Stages—this is **unity of person** (人一).

This completes the summary demonstration of the wonderful meaning.

---

## The Three Wonderful Dharmas (三法妙)

廣說者：先法，次妙。南岳師舉三種，謂眾生法、佛法、心法。

> **Extensive explanation:** First the dharmas, then the Wonderful. Master Nanyue raised three kinds: **Sentient Being Dharma**, **Buddha Dharma**, and **Mind Dharma**.

如經：「為令眾生，開示悟入佛之知見。」若眾生無佛知見，何所論開？當知佛之知見蘊在眾生也。

> As the sūtra says: "In order to cause sentient beings to open, reveal, awaken to, and enter the Buddha's knowledge and vision." If sentient beings had no Buddha-knowledge-and-vision, what would there be to discuss opening? Therefore know: **the Buddha's knowledge and vision is stored within sentient beings**.[^2]

---

### 1. Sentient Being Dharma Is Wonderful (眾生法妙)

又經：「但以父母所生眼」，即肉眼；「徹見內外彌樓山」，即天眼。洞見諸色而無染著，即慧眼。見色無錯謬即法眼。雖未得無漏，而其眼根清淨。若此一眼具諸眼用，即佛眼。此是今經明眾生法妙之文也。

> The sūtra says: "With only the eyes born from one's parents"—this is the **fleshly eye**. "Thoroughly seeing both inside and outside Mount Sumeru"—this is the **heavenly eye**. Seeing all forms without attachment—this is the **wisdom eye**. Seeing forms without error—this is the **Dharma eye**. Though one has not yet attained the outflows, the eye-faculty is purified. If this one eye possesses the functions of all eyes—this is the **Buddha eye**.

This is the text in the present sūtra clarifying that **Sentient Being Dharma is Wonderful**.

《大經》云：「學大乘者，雖有肉眼，名為佛眼。耳鼻五根，例亦如是。」

> The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "Those who study the Great Vehicle, though they have fleshly eyes, are called [to have] Buddha eyes. The ear, nose, and five faculties are also thus."

《殃掘》云：「所謂彼眼根，於諸如來常，具足無減修，了了分明見。」

> The *Aṅgulimālīya* says: "That eye-faculty, with respect to all Tathāgatas, is always fully cultivated without diminution, clearly seeing with distinct clarity."

乃至意根亦如是。

> And so it is, up to the mind faculty.

《大品》云：「六自在王，性清淨故。」又云：「一切法趣眼，是趣不過。」

> The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā* says: "The six sovereign kings—because their nature is pure." And: "All dharmas tend toward the eye; this tending does not surpass [the eye]."[^3]

眼尚不可得，何況有趣、有非趣？

> If the eye itself is not obtainable, how much less are there “tendings” or “non‑tendings”?

乃至一切法趣意，亦如是。

> All the way up to “all dharmas tend toward mind”—it is also thus.

此即諸經明眾生法妙也。

> This is how the various sūtras clarify that **Sentient Being Dharma is Wonderful**.

---

### 2. Buddha Dharma Is Wonderful (佛法妙)

佛法妙者，如經：「止止不須說，我法妙難思。」

> **Buddha Dharma is Wonderful:** As the sūtra says: "Stop, stop—no need to speak. My Dharma is wonderful and hard to conceive."

佛法不出權、實，「是法甚深妙，難見難可了。一切眾生類，無能知佛者」，即實智妙也。

> The Buddha's Dharma does not go beyond the Provisional and Real. "This Dharma is extremely profound and wonderful, hard to see and hard to comprehend. Among all classes of sentient beings, none can know the Buddha"—this is the **wonderfulness of Real Wisdom**.

「及佛諸餘法，亦無能測者」，即佛權智妙也。

> "And the Buddha's other dharmas—none can fathom them either"—this is the **wonderfulness of the Buddha's Provisional Wisdom**.

如是二法，唯佛與佛乃能究盡諸法實相，是名佛法妙。

> These two dharmas—only a Buddha and a Buddha can fully fathom the True Mark of all dharmas. This is called **Buddha Dharma is Wonderful**.

---

### 3. Mind Dharma Is Wonderful (心法妙)

心法妙者，如〈安樂行〉中，修攝其心，觀一切法，不動不退。又一念隨喜等。

> **Mind Dharma is Wonderful:** As in the "Peaceful Practices" [chapter], one cultivates and controls the mind, contemplating all dharmas—unmoved, unretreating. And "a single thought of rejoicing," etc.

《普賢觀》云：「我心自空，罪福無主」「觀心無心，法不住法。」又「心純是法」。

> The *Samantabhadra Contemplation* says: "My mind is itself empty; sins and merits have no master." "Contemplating the mind, there is no mind; dharmas do not abide in dharmas." And: "The mind is purely the Dharma."

《淨名》云：「觀身實相，觀佛亦然。諸佛解脫當於眾生心行中求。」

> The *Vimalakīrti* says: "Contemplating the body's true mark—contemplating the Buddha is also thus. The liberation of all Buddhas should be sought within the mental activities of sentient beings."

《華嚴》云：「心、佛及眾生，是三無差別」「破心微塵，出大千經卷」，是名心法妙也。

> The *Avataṃsaka* says: "**Mind, Buddha, and sentient beings—these three are without difference.**" "**Breaking open the atom of the mind, there emerge sūtra-scrolls of the great-thousand [world].**"[^4]

This is called **Mind Dharma is Wonderful**.

---

△今依三法，更廣分別。

> △Now, relying on the three dharmas, we further distinguish in detail.

若廣眾生法，一往通論諸因果及一切法。

> If we broadly discuss sentient‑being dharma, in general we discuss all causes and fruits and all dharmas.

若廣佛法，此則據果。

> If we broadly discuss Buddha dharma, this is based on the fruit.

若廣心法，此則據因。

> If we broadly discuss mind dharma, this is based on the cause.

眾生法為二：先列法數，次解法相。

> Sentient‑being dharma has two parts: first, listing the number of dharmas; second, explaining the dharma‑marks.

數者，經論或明一法攝一切法，謂心是：三界無別法，唯是一心作。

> As to the number: sūtras and śāstras sometimes clarify that one dharma encompasses all dharmas—namely mind: in the three realms there are no separate dharmas; they are only made by one mind.

或明二法攝一切法，所謂名、色：一切世間中，但有名與色。

> Or they clarify that two dharmas encompass all dharmas—namely name and form: in all worldly realms, there are only name and form.

或明三法攝一切法：謂命、識、煖。

> Or they clarify that three dharmas encompass all dharmas—namely life, consciousness, and warmth.

如是等增數，乃至百千。

> Thus these numbers increase, up to hundreds and thousands.

## The Ten Suchnesses (十如是)

今經用十法攝一切法：「所謂諸法：如是相、如是性、如是體、如是力、如是作、如是因、如是緣、如是果、如是報、如是本末究竟等。」

> **This present sūtra uses ten dharmas to encompass all dharmas:** "The so-called dharmas: suchness of mark, suchness of nature, suchness of substance, suchness of power, suchness of activity, suchness of cause, suchness of condition, suchness of effect, suchness of retribution, suchness of ultimate equality from beginning to end."[^5]

南岳師讀此文皆云如，故呼為十如也。

> Master Nanyue read all [ten items] in this text as "*ru*" (如, "suchness")—hence they are called the **Ten Suchnesses**.

---

### Master Zhiyi's Threefold Reading

天台師云：「依義讀文，凡有三轉。」

> **Master Tiantai said:** "Reading the text according to meaning, there are altogether **three turns**."

一云：是相如、是性如，乃至是報如。

> **First:** "The mark is suchness, the nature is suchness... down to the retribution is suchness."

二云：如是相、如是性，乃至如是報。

> **Second:** "Suchness of mark, suchness of nature... down to suchness of retribution."

三云：相如是、性如是，乃至報如是。

> **Third:** "The mark is thus, the nature is thus... down to the retribution is thus."

---

### The Three Truths in the Three Readings

若皆稱如者，如名不異，即空義也。

> If all are called "suchness"—the name "suchness" is not different—this is the meaning of **Emptiness**.

若作如是相、如是性者，點空相性，名字施設，邐迤不同，即假義也。

> If read as "suchness of mark, suchness of nature," pointing out empty marks and natures with conventional designations, each proceeding differently—this is the meaning of the **Provisional**.

若作相如是者，如於中道實相之是，即中義也。

> If read as "the mark is thus"—"thus" being the true mark of the Middle Way—this is the meaning of the **Middle**.

---

### Emptiness, Provisional, and Middle Are Mutually Inclusive

分別令易解故，明空、假、中，得意為言，空即假、中。

> For easy understanding, we distinguish Emptiness, Provisional, and Middle. But grasping the meaning: **Emptiness is precisely Provisional and Middle.**

約如明空，一空一切空。點如明相，一假一切假。就是論中，一中一切中，非一二三而一二三，不縱不橫，名為實相。

> From "suchness," clarify Emptiness—**one emptiness is all emptiness**. Pointing to "suchness," clarify marks—**one provisional is all provisional**. In terms of "thus," discuss the Middle—**one Middle is all Middle**. Neither one, two, three, yet one, two, three. Neither vertical nor horizontal—this is called **True Reality**.

唯佛與佛，究竟此法。

> **Only a Buddha and a Buddha can fathom this dharma.**

是十法，攝一切法。

> These **ten dharmas encompass all dharmas**.

若依義便，作三意分別。

> If we follow the convenience of meaning, we make a threefold distinction of intent.

若依讀便，當依偈文云：「如是大果報，種種性相義」(云云)。

> If we follow the convenience of reading, we should follow the gāthā text: "Such is the great fruit and retribution, the many meanings of nature and mark" (and so on).

次判權實者，光宅以前五如是為權，屬凡夫；次四如是為實，屬聖人；後一如是，總結權實。

> Next, in judging Provisional and Real: Guangzhai took the first five "suchnesses" as Provisional, belonging to ordinary beings; the next four suchnesses as Real, belonging to sagely beings; the last suchness sums up Provisional and Real.

引偈證云：「如是大果報」，大故知是實；「種種性相」，故知是權。

> He adduces a gāthā as proof: "Such is the great fruit and retribution"—because it is "great" he knows it is Real; "many kinds of nature and mark"—therefore he knows it is Provisional.

今恐不爾，大義有三：大、多、勝。

> Now I fear this is not so. The great meaning has three: great, many, and victorious.

若取大為實者，亦應取多取勝。

> If one takes "great" as Real, one should also take "many" and "victorious."

種種之名，豈非多義？

> Is not the name "many kinds" precisely the meaning of "many"?

若言權屬凡夫，凡夫何意無實？

> If one says the Provisional belongs to ordinary beings, what do ordinary beings mean by having no Real?

若實屬聖人，聖人何意無權？

> If the Real belongs to sagely beings, what do sagely beings mean by having no Provisional?

如此抑沒，義不可依。

> Such suppression and effacement—the meaning cannot be relied upon.

又北地師以前五為權，後五為實。

> Moreover, the Northern Master took the first five as Provisional and the latter five as Real.

此皆人情耳。

> These are all merely human sentiment.

---

## The Ten Dharma-Realms (十法界)

今明權實者，以十如是約十法界，謂六道、四聖也。

> Now to clarify Provisional and Real: the Ten Suchnesses in terms of the **Ten Dharma-Realms**—the Six Destinies and the Four Sagely [realms].

皆稱法界者，其意有三：

> All are called "Dharma-Realms"—the meaning has three aspects:

一、十數皆依法界，法界外更無復法。能、所合稱，故言十法界也。

> 1. All ten numbers depend on the Dharma-Realm; outside the Dharma-Realm there are no other dharmas. Combining the capable and what is capable—hence "Ten Dharma-Realms."

二、此十種法，分齊不同，因果隔別，凡聖有異，故加之以界也。

> 2. These ten kinds of dharmas differ in their divisions; cause and effect are separately distinguished; ordinary and sagely are different—hence "realm" is added.

三、此十皆即法界，攝一切法。一切法趣地獄，是趣不過。當體即理，更無所依，故名法界。乃至佛法界，亦復如是。

> 3. All ten are precisely the Dharma-Realm, encompassing all dharmas. All dharmas tend toward hell—the tending does not surpass [hell]. The very substance is principle; there is nothing further to depend on—hence "Dharma-Realm." So too, up to the Buddha Dharma-Realm, it is likewise.[^6]

若十數依法界者，能依從所依，即入空界也。

> If the ten numbers depend on the Dharma-Realm, the dependent follows what is depended on—this is entry into the realm of Emptiness.

十界界隔者，即假界也。

> If the ten realms are partitioned by realms, this is the realm of the Provisional.

十數皆法界者，即中界也。

> If the ten numbers are all Dharma-Realms, this is the realm of the Middle.

欲令易解，如此分別。

> To make it easy to understand, we distinguish it in this way.

得意為言，空即假、中，無一二三，如前(云云)。

> Grasping the meaning: Emptiness is precisely Provisional and Middle. There is no one, two, three, as before (and so on).

---

## The Hundred Realms and Thousand Suchnesses (百界千如)

此一法界具十如是，十法界具百如是。

> One Dharma-Realm possesses ten suchnesses. **Ten Dharma-Realms possess one hundred suchnesses.**

又一法界具九法界，則有百法界，千如是。

> Moreover, one Dharma-Realm contains nine Dharma-Realms—thus there are **one hundred Dharma-Realms** and **one thousand suchnesses**.

束為五差：一、惡。二、善。三、二乘。四、菩薩。五、佛。判為二法：前四是權法，後一是實法，細論各具權實，且依兩義。

> Grouped into five categories: (1) Evil, (2) Good, (3) Two Vehicles, (4) Bodhisattva, (5) Buddha. Classified into two dharmas: the first four are **Provisional Dharma**; the last one is **Real Dharma**. In detailed discussion, each contains both Provisional and Real; for now we follow the twofold meaning.

然此權實不可思議，乃是三世諸佛二智之境。

> Yet this Provisional and Real is inconceivable—it is the realm of the dual wisdom of the Buddhas of the Three Times.

以此為境，何法不收？

> Taking this as the realm, what dharma is not included?

此境發智，何智不發？

> From this realm arises wisdom—what wisdom does it not bring forth?

故文云「諸法」。

> Therefore the text says "all dharmas."

諸法者，是所照境廣也。

> "All dharmas" means the breadth of the illuminated realm.

唯佛與佛乃能究盡者，明能照智深，窮邊盡底也。

> "Only a Buddha and a Buddha can fathom [it]" clarifies the depth of the illuminating wisdom, reaching the edge and bottom.

其智慧門難解難入者，歎境妙也。

> "The gate of wisdom is hard to understand and hard to enter" praises the wonder of the realm.

我所得智慧，微妙最第一者，歎智與境相稱也。

> "The wisdom I have attained is subtly wonderful and most supreme" praises the correspondence of wisdom and realm.

〈方便品〉長行，略說此法。

> The long prose of the *Skillful Means* chapter briefly explains this dharma.

後開示悟入，廣說此法。

> Later, "opening, revealing, awakening, and entering" explains this dharma in detail.

火宅，譬喻此法。

> The Burning House is a parable of this dharma.

信解，領解此法。

> Faith and Understanding receives and understands this dharma.

長者，付子此法。

> The Elder entrusts the son—this dharma.

藥草，述成此法。

> The Medicinal Herbs describes and completes this dharma.

化城，引入此法。

> The Conjured City leads into this dharma.

如是等種種，秖名十如權實法耳。

> All such various [teachings] are only named the Ten-Suchnesses Provisional-and-Real Dharma.

---

## The Buddha's Perfect Knowledge

如來洞達，究十法底、盡十法邊，明識眾生：種、非種，芽、未芽，熟、不熟，可度脫、不可度脫，如實知之，無有錯謬。

> The Tathāgata penetrates thoroughly, fathoming the bottom of the ten dharmas, exhausting the boundaries of the ten dharmas. He clearly recognizes sentient beings: seeded or unseeded, sprouted or unsprouted, ripened or unripened, capable of liberation or incapable—**knowing them as they truly are, without error**.

殃掘摩羅雖是惡人，實相性熟，即時得度。四禪比丘雖是善人，惡性相熟，即不堪度。

> Aṅgulimāla, though an evil man, had his true-mark nature ripened—he was immediately ferried across. The monk of the Fourth Dhyāna, though a good man, had his evil-nature mark ripened—he was not capable of being ferried.

當知，眾生之法不可思議，雖實而權，雖權而實，實、權相即，不相妨礙。

> **Know this: Sentient Being Dharma is inconceivable.** Though Real, yet Provisional; though Provisional, yet Real. Real and Provisional mutually entail each other without obstruction.

不可以牛、羊眼觀視眾生，不可以凡夫心評量眾生。智如如來，乃能評量。何以故？眾生法妙故。

> One cannot view sentient beings with ox or sheep eyes. One cannot evaluate sentient beings with an ordinary person's mind. Only wisdom like the Tathāgata's can evaluate them. **Why? Because Sentient Being Dharma is Wonderful.**

---

## Explaining the Ten Suchnesses (十如是法)

次解十如是法。初、通解，後、別解。

> Next, we explain the Ten Suchnesses dharmas. First, general explanation; second, particular explanation.

### General Explanation (通解)

通解者，相以據外，覽而可別，名為相。

> In general explanation: mark is based on the outer; when one examines it, it can be distinguished—this is called mark.

性以據內，自分不改，名為性。

> Nature is based on the inner; its own portion does not change—this is called nature.

主質名為體。

> The ruling substance is called substance.

功能為力。

> Function is called power.

構造為作。

> Constructing and making is called activity.

習因為因。

> Habitual cause is called cause.

助因為緣。

> Auxiliary cause is called condition.

習果為果。

> Habitual effect is called effect.

報果為報。

> Retributive effect is called retribution.

初相為本，後報為末。

> The initial mark is the beginning; the later retribution is the end.

所歸趣處，為究竟等(云云)。

> The place to which it returns and tends is called ultimate equality (and so on).

若作如義，初後皆空為等。

> If one takes the meaning of "suchness," then beginning and end are both empty as equality.

若作性相義，初後相在為等。

> If one takes the meaning of nature and mark, then beginning and end have marks as equality.

若作中義，初後皆實相為等。

> If one takes the meaning of the Middle, then beginning and end are both true suchness as equality.

今不依此等三法具足，為究竟等。

> Now, not relying on these three dharmas as complete, [we] take it as ultimate equality.

夫究竟者，中乃究竟，即是實相為等也。

> As for "ultimate," the Middle is precisely ultimate—this is true suchness as equality.

### Particular Explanation (別解)

次別解者，取氣類相似、合為四番。初四趣、次人天、次二乘、次菩薩佛也。

> Next, in the particular explanation: take those of similar temperament and class and combine them into four sets. First the Four Destinies, next human and deva, next the Two Vehicles, next bodhisattvas and Buddhas.

初明四趣十法：如是相者，即是惡相，表墮不如意處。

> First, clarifying the ten dharmas of the Four Destinies: the suchness of mark is precisely an evil mark, indicating a fall into an undesirable place.

譬人未禍，否色已彰，相師覽別，能記凶衰。

> For example, before a person's misfortune, the ominous color already manifests; a physiognomist examines and distinguishes and can record the inauspicious decline.

惡相若起，遠表泥黎，凡夫不知，二乘髣髴知，菩薩知不深，佛知盡邊。

> If an evil mark arises, it indicates hell from afar. Ordinary beings do not know it; the Two Vehicles know it dimly; bodhisattvas know it not deeply; Buddhas know it to the end.

如善相師，洞見始終，故言如是相也。

> Like a good physiognomist who sees through beginning and end—therefore it is called the suchness of mark.

如是性者，黑自分性也。

> The suchness of nature is the black self-portion nature.

純習黑惡，難可改變。

> It is purely habituated to black evil and is difficult to change.

如木有火，遇緣即發。

> Like wood containing fire: when it meets a condition, it immediately flares.

《大經》云：「有漏之法，以有生性，故生能生之。」

> The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "Leaky dharmas, because they have a nature of arising, therefore arising can bring them to arise."

此惡有四趣生性，故緣能發之。

> This evil has the arising nature of the Four Destinies; therefore conditions can bring it forth.

若泥木像，雖有外相，內無生性，生不能生。

> If it is a mud or wooden image, though it has an external mark, inside it has no nature of arising, so arising cannot arise [from it].

惡性不爾，故言如是性。

> Evil nature is not thus; therefore it is called the suchness of nature.

如是體者，攬彼摧折，麁惡色、心，以為體質也。

> The suchness of substance gathers those crushed, coarse and evil forms and minds, taking them as the substance.

復次，此世先已摧心，來世摧色。

> Furthermore, in this life the mind is already crushed; in the next life the form is crushed.

又此世華報，亦摧色、心，來世果報亦摧色、心。

> Moreover, the flower-retribution of this life also crushes form and mind; the fruit-retribution of the next life also crushes form and mind.

故以被摧色、心為體也。

> Therefore the crushed form and mind are taken as substance.

如是力者，惡功用也。

> The suchness of power is evil function.

譬如片物，雖未被用，指擬所任，言其有用。

> For example, a piece of material: though it has not yet been used, pointing to what it can serve, one says it has function.

《大經》云：「作舍取木，不取縷線，作布取縷，不取泥木。」

> The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "To build a house, take wood, not thread; to weave cloth, take thread, not mud or wood."

地獄有登刀上劍之用，餓鬼吞銅、噉鐵之用，畜生強者伏弱，魚鱗相咀，牽車挽重，皆是惡力用也。

> In hell there is the function of climbing knives and mounting swords; hungry ghosts have the function of swallowing copper and chewing iron; animals have the strong subdue the weak, fish scales bite each other, pulling carts and hauling heavy loads—all are evil functions of power.

如是作者，構造經營，運動三業，建創諸惡，名之為作。

> The suchness of activity: constructing and managing, moving the three karmic acts, building and creating various evils—this is called activity.

《大經》第八云：「譬如世間，為惡行者，名為半人。」

> The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*, fascicle eight, says: "For example, in the world, one who does evil acts is called half a person."

既行惡行，名地獄作也。

> Having already done evil acts—this is called hell activity.

如是因者，惡習因也。

> The suchness of cause is the cause of evil habit.

自種相生，習續不斷，以習發故，為惡易成，故名如是因。

> Its own seed gives rise to corresponding [results]; habits continue without interruption. Because they are aroused by habit, evil is easily accomplished—therefore it is called the suchness of cause.

如是緣者，緣助也。

> The suchness of condition is assistance by conditions.

所謂諸惡我、我所，所有具度，皆能助成習業，如水能潤種，故用報因為緣也。

> That is, all evil self and what belongs to self, with all their accompaniments, can assist in completing habitual karma; like water moistening seeds. Therefore the retributive cause is used as the condition.

如是果者，習果也。

> The suchness of effect is the habitual effect.

如多欲人受地獄身，見苦具，謂為欲境，便起染愛，謂此為習果也。

> For example, a person of much desire receives a hell body, sees the instruments of suffering, takes them as objects of desire, and gives rise to defiled love—this is called the habitual effect.

如是報者，報果也。

> The suchness of retribution is retributive effect.

如多欲人，在地獄中，趣欲境時，即受銅柱鐵床之苦。

> For example, a person of much desire, in hell, when approaching desired objects, immediately receives the suffering of copper pillars and iron beds.

故名如是報也。

> Therefore it is called the suchness of retribution.

本末究竟等者，即有三義：本空、末亦空，故言等。

> "Ultimate equality from beginning to end" has three meanings: the beginning is empty and the end is also empty—therefore it is called equal.

又惡果報，在本相性中，此末與本等。

> Moreover, evil retribution-fruit is within the initial mark and nature; this end is equal to the beginning.

本相性，在惡果報中，此本與末等。

> The initial mark and nature are within the evil retribution-fruit; this beginning is equal to the end.

若先無後事，相師不應預記。

> If there were no later events in the beginning, a physiognomist should not foretell.

若後無先事，相師不應追記。

> If there were no earlier events in the end, a physiognomist should not retrospectively record.

當知，初後相在，此假事論等。

> You should know: the initial and later marks are present—this is equality discussed in terms of provisional phenomena.

中實理心，與佛果不異。

> The real principle-mind of the Middle is not different from the Buddha-fruit.

一色一香，無非中道，此約理論等。

> In one color and one fragrance, nothing is not the Middle Way—this is equality discussed in terms of principle.

以是義故，故言本末究竟等，三義具足，故言等也。

> Because of this meaning, it is called ultimate equality from beginning to end; the three meanings are complete—therefore it is called equal.

次辨人天界十法者，但就善樂為語，異於四趣。

> Next, distinguishing the ten dharmas of the human and deva realms: we speak only in terms of good and joy, different from the Four Destinies.

相表清升。

> The mark indicates pure ascent.

性是白法。

> The nature is white dharma.

體是安樂色、心。

> The substance is peaceful and joyful form and mind.

力是堪任善器。

> The power is fitness to serve as a good vessel.

作是造止、行二善。

> The activity is forming the two goods of cessation and practice.

因是白業。

> The cause is white karma.

緣是善我、我所，所有具度。

> The conditions are the good self and what belongs to self, with all their accompaniments.

果是任運酬善心生。

> The effect is the arising of a mind that naturally requites the good.

報是自然受樂。

> The retribution is receiving joy naturally.

等者，如前說(云云)。

> As for equality, it is as explained above (and so on).

次辨二乘法界十法者，約真無漏。

> Next, distinguishing the ten dharmas of the Two-Vehicle Dharma-Realm, in terms of true outflow-free [dharmas].

相表涅槃。

> The mark indicates nirvāṇa.

性是非白、非黑法。

> The nature is neither white nor black dharma.

體是五分法身。

> The substance is the five-part Dharma body.

力能動、能出，堪任道器。

> The power can move and can emerge, fit to serve as a vessel of the path.

作是精進勤策。

> The activity is diligent striving.

因是無漏正智。

> The cause is outflow-free right wisdom.

緣是行行助道。

> The conditions are practices that assist the path.

果是四果。

> The effect is the four fruits.

二乘既不生，是故無報。

> Since the Two Vehicles do not give birth [to further rebirth], therefore there is no retribution.

何故發真是果而不論報？

> Why is the arising of truth called the effect yet retribution is not discussed?

無漏法起，酬於習因，得是習果。

> Outflow-free dharmas arise, repaying the habitual cause—this is the habitual effect.

無漏損生，非牽生法，故無後報。

> Outflow-free [dharmas] reduce birth; they are not dharmas that draw one into birth—therefore there is no later retribution.

三果有報者，殘思未斷，或七生，或一往來，或色界生，非無漏報也。

> Those with retribution in the third fruit have residual thought not yet cut off—either seven births, or one return, or rebirth in the form realm; this is not outflow-free retribution.

是故唯九不十。

> Therefore there are only nine, not ten.

若依大乘，此無漏猶名有漏。

> If one follows the Mahāyāna, this outflow-free is still called outflowing.

《大經》云：「福德莊嚴者，有為有漏。」

> The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "Those adorned with merit are conditioned and outflowing."

是聲聞僧既非無漏，不損別惑，猶受變易之生，則無漏為因、無明為緣，生變易土，即有報也。

> Since the śrāvaka saṅgha is not outflow-free and does not diminish distinct delusions, it still receives transformation birth. Thus outflow-free [dharmas] are the cause and ignorance is the condition; born in the transformation land, there is retribution.

次明菩薩、佛界十法者，此更細開有三種菩薩(云云)。

> Next, clarifying the ten dharmas of the Bodhisattva and Buddha realms: here it is further and finely opened into three kinds of bodhisattvas (and so on).

若六度菩薩，約福德論相、性、體、力；善業為因；煩惱為緣；三十四心斷結為果。

> If [it is] the Six-Perfections bodhisattva, in terms of merit one discusses mark, nature, substance, and power; good karma is the cause; afflictions are the conditions; the thirty-four minds cutting off fetters are the effect.

佛則無報，菩薩即具十也。

> The Buddha then has no retribution; the bodhisattva accordingly has all ten.

若通教菩薩，約無漏論相、性。

> If [it is] the Common-Teaching bodhisattva, one discusses mark and nature in terms of outflow-free [dharmas].

六地之前，殘思受報；六地思盡，不受後身，誓扶習生，非實業報，故唯九無十。

> Before the sixth ground, residual thought receives retribution; at the sixth ground, thought is exhausted and there is no later body. One vows to support habitual birth—this is not real karmic retribution; therefore only nine, no ten.

若別教菩薩，約修中道行次第觀而論十法。

> If [it is] the Distinct-Teaching bodhisattva, one discusses the ten dharmas in terms of cultivating Middle Way practice and the step-by-step contemplation.

此人雖斷通惑，自知有生，則具十法(云云)。

> Though such a person cuts off common delusions, knowing of birth in themselves, they thus possess ten dharmas (and so on).

夫生變易，則三種不同：一、全未斷別惑生變易者，即是三藏、二乘及通教三乘是也。

> As for transformation birth, there are three kinds: (1) Those who have not at all cut off distinct delusions and are born in transformation—this refers to the Tripiṭaka, the Two Vehicles, and the Common-Teaching Three Vehicles.

類如分段博地凡夫，不伏見、思者(云云)。

> They are like segmental, worldly ordinary beings who do not subdue view and thought (and so on).

二、伏別惑生變易者，即是別教三十心人，習於中道，伏而未斷，類如分段小乘方便道也(云云)。

> (2) Those who subdue distinct delusions and are born in transformation—these are the Distinct-Teaching thirty-mind persons, practicing the Middle Way, subduing but not cutting off; they are like the segmental Hīnayāna's preparatory path (and so on).

三者、斷別惑生變易者，如初地、初住斷惑是也。

> (3) Those who cut off distinct delusions and are born in transformation—such as the first ground and first abode cutting off delusion.

類如初果，雖斷見諦，猶有七生，彼亦如是。

> They are like the first fruit: though the view of truth is cut off, there are still seven births; it is the same here.

若未斷伏生者，用方便行，真無漏為因，無明為緣。

> If one has not cut off but has subdued, using expedient practice, true outflow-free [dharmas] are the cause and ignorance is the condition.

若伏斷者，順道法愛為因，無明為緣，生變易土(云云)。

> If one has subdued and cut off, accordant with the path, dharma-love is the cause and ignorance is the condition; one is born in the transformation land (and so on).

佛界十法者，皆約中道分別也。

> As for the ten dharmas of the Buddha-realm, they are all distinguished in terms of the Middle Way.

《淨名》云：「一切眾生皆菩提相，不可復得。」

> The *Vimalakīrti* says: "All sentient beings are the mark of bodhi; it cannot be obtained again."

此即緣因為佛相。

> This is the conditioning cause as the Buddha's mark.

性以據內者，智願猶在不失，智即了因為佛性。

> As for nature based on the inner: wisdom and vows still remain and are not lost; wisdom is precisely the understanding-cause as Buddha-nature.

自性清淨心，即是正因為佛體。

> The intrinsically pure mind is precisely the true cause as Buddha-substance.

此即三軌也(云云)。

> This is the three tracks (and so on).

力者，初發菩提心，超二乘上，名為力。

> As for power: the initial arousing of the bodhi mind, surpassing the Two Vehicles, is called power.

作者，四弘誓願要期也。

> As for activity: the four vast vows are its pledge.

因即智慧莊嚴也。

> The cause is the adornment of wisdom.

緣即福德莊嚴也。

> The conditions are the adornment of merit.

果即一念相應，大覺朗然，無上菩提，為習果也。

> The effect is the correspondence in a single thought: great awakening bright and clear, unsurpassed bodhi—this is the habitual effect.

報即大般涅槃果，果斷德，禪定三昧，一切具足，是報果也。

> The retribution is the fruit of great parinirvāṇa; the fruit of severing virtue, dhyāna and samādhi, all complete—this is the retribution fruit.

本末等者，即相性三諦與究竟三諦不異，故言等也。

> As for equality from beginning to end: the three truths of mark and nature are not different from the three ultimate truths—therefore it is called equal.

空諦等者，元初眾生如，乃至佛如皆等也。

> As for equality of the emptiness truth: from the original suchness of sentient beings up to the suchness of the Buddha, all are equal.

俗諦等者，眾生未發心，佛記當作佛。

> As for equality of the conventional truth: when sentient beings have not yet aroused the mind, the Buddha predicts they will become Buddhas.

佛既已成佛，說佛本生事，即是初後相在假等也。

> When the Buddha has already become Buddha and speaks of his former-life deeds, this is the provisional equality of initial and later marks.

中等者，凡聖皆實相也。

> As for equality of the Middle: ordinary and holy are all true suchness.

就佛界亦九亦十。

> In the Buddha realm there are both nine and ten.

通途為語，從地地皆有萬行，福德為因、無明為緣，習果報果，分得十法，無不具足。

> Generally speaking, from ground to ground there are myriads of practices: merit is the cause and ignorance is the condition; habitual effect and retributive effect—each obtains the ten dharmas in part, all without lacking.

此經云：「得無量無漏清淨之果報。法王法中久修梵行，始於今日得其果報。」

> This sūtra says: "Attain immeasurable outflow-free, pure retribution. In the Dharma of the Dharma-King, having long cultivated brahma-conduct, only today do [we] obtain its retribution."

又云：「久修業所得。」

> It also says: "Obtained from long-cultivated karma."

《大經》云：「我今所獻食，願得無上報。」

> The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "The food I now offer—may I obtain the unsurpassed retribution."

《仁王》云：「三賢、十聖住果報。」

> The *Renwang* says: "The three worthies and ten sages abide in retribution."

《攝大乘》云：「因緣生死、有後生死。」

> The *Mahāyānasaṃgraha* says: "Conditioned birth-and-death; there is later birth-and-death."

皆是分論果報，果報即是生滅。

> All of these discuss retribution in parts; retribution is precisely arising and ceasing.

何者？

> Why?

無明分盡，是故論滅，真明轉盛，是故言生。

> Ignorance is exhausted in part; therefore we speak of ceasing. True illumination turns and flourishes; therefore we speak of arising.

又殘無明在，是故言生。

> Moreover, residual ignorance remains; therefore we speak of arising.

一分惑除，是故言滅。

> One portion of delusion is removed; therefore we speak of ceasing.

《大論》云：「一人能耘，一人能種。」

> The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra* says: "One person can plow; one person can sow."

萬行資成如種，智慧破惑如耘。

> The myriad practices are like seeds that provide completion; wisdom breaks delusions like plowing.

增道損生，意在於此。

> Increasing the path and diminishing birth—the intent lies here.

四十一地，皆有十法也。

> In the forty-one stages, all have the ten dharmas.

[^5]: The **Ten Suchnesses** (十如是) are a distinctive Tiantai reading of *Lotus Sūtra* Chapter 2. Kumārajīva's translation repeats "ru shi" (如是) ten times; Zhiyi interprets this as ten categories applicable to all dharmas.

[^6]: This triple interpretation of "Dharma-Realm" (法界) shows how each of the ten realms is (1) part of the totality, (2) distinct from others, and (3) complete in itself as principle.
