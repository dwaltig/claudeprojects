## Introduction to the Detailed Interpretation

四、正論今意，為二：先、略用彼名顯於妙義。

> **Fourth, the correct discussion of the present meaning** has two parts: first, briefly using those names to reveal the wonderful meaning.

---

### The Three Meanings of Cause (因)

因具三義者：

> **Cause possesses three meanings:**

一法界具九法界，名體廣。

> 1. One Dharma-Realm contains the nine Dharma-Realms—this is called **breadth of substance** (體廣).

九法界即佛法界，名位高。

> 2. The nine Dharma-Realms are precisely the Buddha Dharma-Realm—this is called **height of position** (位高).

十法界即空、即假、即中，名用長。

> 3. The Ten Dharma-Realms are precisely emptiness, precisely provisional, precisely the Middle—this is called **length of function** (用長).

即一而論三，即三而論一，非各異，亦非橫，亦非一，故稱妙也。

> Discussing three in terms of one, discussing one in terms of three—neither separately different, nor horizontal, nor singular—therefore it is called **Wonderful**.

---

### The Three Meanings of Fruit (果)

果體具三義者，體遍一切處，名體廣。久已成佛久遠久遠，名位高。從本垂迹，過、現、未來三世益物，名用長。

> **The substance of fruit possesses three meanings:**
> - Substance pervades all places—**breadth of substance**.
> - [The Buddha] has long since attained Buddhahood, remotely remote—**height of position**.
> - From the Fundamental, the Trace descends; past, present, and future—benefiting beings in the three times—**length of function**.

是為因果六義，異於餘經，是故稱妙。

> These are the **six meanings of cause and effect**, different from other sūtras. Therefore it is called **Wonderful**.

---

## The Five Flavors and Cause/Effect

又乳經一種因果廣、高、長，一種因果狹、下、短，則一麁一妙。

> In the **Milk Teaching** (*Avataṃsaka*), one kind of cause-and-effect is broad, high, and long; one kind is narrow, low, and short—thus one coarse, one wonderful.[^1]

酪教唯一種因果狹、下、短，但麁無妙。

> In the **Curds Teaching** (*Tripiṭaka*), there is only one kind of cause-and-effect: narrow, low, and short—only coarse, no wonderful.

生蘇經三種因果狹、下、短，一種因果廣、高、長，則三麁一妙。

> In the **Fresh Butter Teaching** (*Vaipulya*), three kinds are narrow, low, short; one kind is broad, high, long—thus three coarse, one wonderful.

熟蘇經二種因果狹、下、短，一種因果廣、高、長，則二麁一妙。

> In the **Clarified Butter Teaching** (*Prajñā*), two kinds are narrow, low, short; one kind is broad, high, long—thus two coarse, one wonderful.

醍醐經一種因果廣、高、長，但妙無麁。

> In the **Ghee Teaching** (*Lotus*), there is one kind of cause-and-effect: broad, high, and long—**only wonderful, no coarse**.

又醍醐經妙因、妙果，與諸經妙因、妙果不異，故稱為妙也。

> Moreover, in the Ghee Teaching, the wonderful cause and wonderful fruit do not differ from the wonderful cause and fruit of other sūtras—therefore it is called **Wonderful**.

---

## Observing the Mind (觀心)

復次觀心釋。若觀己心不具眾生心、佛心者，是體狹；具者是體廣。

> **Furthermore, the interpretation through Observing the Mind:** If one contemplates one's own mind and [finds that] it does not contain the minds of sentient beings and the Buddha-mind, this is **narrow substance**. If it contains them, this is **broad substance**.

若己心不等佛心是位下；若等佛心是位高。

> If one's own mind is not equal to the Buddha-mind, this is **low position**. If equal to the Buddha-mind, this is **high position**.

若己心、眾生心、佛心，不即空、即假、即中者，是用短；即空、即假、即中者，是用長。

> If one's own mind, sentient beings' minds, and the Buddha-mind are not precisely empty, precisely provisional, precisely the Middle, this is **short function**. If they are precisely empty, precisely provisional, precisely the Middle, this is **long function**.

---

### The Four Unities

復次，於一法界通達十法界六即位者，亦是體廣，亦是位高，亦是用長。

> Furthermore, penetrating the Ten Dharma-Realms and the Six Stages of Identity within one Dharma-Realm—this is also breadth of substance, height of position, and length of function.

初約十法界，是顯理一；次約五味，是約教一；次約觀心，是約行一；次約六即，是約人一。略示妙義竟。

> - First, in terms of the Ten Dharma-Realms—this reveals **unity of principle** (理一).
> - Second, in terms of the Five Flavors—this is **unity of teaching** (教一).
> - Third, in terms of Observing the Mind—this is **unity of practice** (行一).
> - Fourth, in terms of the Six Stages—this is **unity of person** (人一).

This completes the summary demonstration of the wonderful meaning.

## The Three Wonderful Dharmas (三法妙)

廣說者：先法，次妙。南岳師舉三種，謂眾生法、佛法、心法。

> **Extensive explanation:** First the dharmas, then the Wonderful. Master Nanyue raised three kinds: **Sentient Being Dharma**, **Buddha Dharma**, and **Mind Dharma**.

如經：「為令眾生，開示悟入佛之知見。」若眾生無佛知見，何所論開？當知佛之知見蘊在眾生也。

> As the sūtra says: "In order to cause sentient beings to open, reveal, awaken to, and enter the Buddha's knowledge and vision." If sentient beings had no Buddha-knowledge-and-vision, what would there be to discuss opening? Therefore know: **the Buddha's knowledge and vision is stored within sentient beings**.[^2]

---

### 1. Sentient Being Dharma Is Wonderful (眾生法妙)

又經：「但以父母所生眼」，即肉眼；「徹見內外彌樓山」，即天眼。洞見諸色而無染著，即慧眼。見色無錯謬即法眼。雖未得無漏，而其眼根清淨。若此一眼具諸眼用，即佛眼。此是今經明眾生法妙之文也。

> The sūtra says: "With only the eyes born from one's parents"—this is the **fleshly eye**. "Thoroughly seeing both inside and outside Mount Sumeru"—this is the **heavenly eye**. Seeing all forms without attachment—this is the **wisdom eye**. Seeing forms without error—this is the **Dharma eye**. Though one has not yet attained the outflows, the eye-faculty is purified. If this one eye possesses the functions of all eyes—this is the **Buddha eye**.

This is the text in the present sūtra clarifying that **Sentient Being Dharma is Wonderful**.

《大經》云：「學大乘者，雖有肉眼，名為佛眼。耳鼻五根，例亦如是。」

> The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "Those who study the Great Vehicle, though they have fleshly eyes, are called [to have] Buddha eyes. The ear, nose, and five faculties are also thus."

《大品》云：「六自在王，性清淨故。」又云：「一切法趣眼，是趣不過。」

> The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā* says: "The six sovereign kings—because their nature is pure." And: "All dharmas tend toward the eye; this tending does not surpass [the eye]."[^3]

此即諸經明眾生法妙也。

> This is how the various sūtras clarify that **Sentient Being Dharma is Wonderful**.

---

### 2. Buddha Dharma Is Wonderful (佛法妙)

佛法妙者，如經：「止止不須說，我法妙難思。」

> **Buddha Dharma is Wonderful:** As the sūtra says: "Stop, stop—no need to speak. My Dharma is wonderful and hard to conceive."

佛法不出權、實，「是法甚深妙，難見難可了。一切眾生類，無能知佛者」，即實智妙也。

> The Buddha's Dharma does not go beyond the Provisional and Real. "This Dharma is extremely profound and wonderful, hard to see and hard to comprehend. Among all classes of sentient beings, none can know the Buddha"—this is the **wonderfulness of Real Wisdom**.

「及佛諸餘法，亦無能測者」，即佛權智妙也。

> "And the Buddha's other dharmas—none can fathom them either"—this is the **wonderfulness of the Buddha's Provisional Wisdom**.

如是二法，唯佛與佛乃能究盡諸法實相，是名佛法妙。

> These two dharmas—only a Buddha and a Buddha can fully fathom the True Mark of all dharmas. This is called **Buddha Dharma is Wonderful**.

---

### 3. Mind Dharma Is Wonderful (心法妙)

心法妙者，如〈安樂行〉中，修攝其心，觀一切法，不動不退。又一念隨喜等。

> **Mind Dharma is Wonderful:** As in the "Peaceful Practices" [chapter], one cultivates and controls the mind, contemplating all dharmas—unmoved, unretreating. And "a single thought of rejoicing," etc.

《普賢觀》云：「我心自空，罪福無主」「觀心無心，法不住法。」又「心純是法」。

> The *Samantabhadra Contemplation* says: "My mind is itself empty; sins and merits have no master." "Contemplating the mind, there is no mind; dharmas do not abide in dharmas." And: "The mind is purely the Dharma."

《淨名》云：「觀身實相，觀佛亦然。諸佛解脫當於眾生心行中求。」

> The *Vimalakīrti* says: "Contemplating the body's true mark—contemplating the Buddha is also thus. The liberation of all Buddhas should be sought within the mental activities of sentient beings."

《華嚴》云：「心、佛及眾生，是三無差別」「破心微塵，出大千經卷」，是名心法妙也。

> The *Avataṃsaka* says: "**Mind, Buddha, and sentient beings—these three are without difference.**" "**Breaking open the atom of the mind, there emerge sūtra-scrolls of the great-thousand [world].**"[^4]

This is called **Mind Dharma is Wonderful**.

---

## The Ten Suchnesses (十如是)

經論或明一法攝一切法，謂心是：三界無別法，唯是一心作。

> Sūtras and śāstras sometimes clarify that one dharma encompasses all dharmas—this is **Mind**: "In the three realms there are no separate dharmas; they are only made by one mind."

今經用十法攝一切法：「所謂諸法：如是相、如是性、如是體、如是力、如是作、如是因、如是緣、如是果、如是報、如是本末究竟等。」

> **This present sūtra uses ten dharmas to encompass all dharmas:** "The so-called dharmas: suchness of mark, suchness of nature, suchness of substance, suchness of power, suchness of activity, suchness of cause, suchness of condition, suchness of effect, suchness of retribution, suchness of ultimate equality from beginning to end."[^5]

南岳師讀此文皆云如，故呼為十如也。

> Master Nanyue read all [ten items] in this text as "*ru*" (如, "suchness")—hence they are called the **Ten Suchnesses**.

---

### Master Zhiyi's Threefold Reading

天台師云：「依義讀文，凡有三轉。」

> **Master Tiantai said:** "Reading the text according to meaning, there are altogether **three turns**."

一云：是相如、是性如，乃至是報如。

> **First:** "The mark is suchness, the nature is suchness... down to the retribution is suchness."

二云：如是相、如是性，乃至如是報。

> **Second:** "Suchness of mark, suchness of nature... down to suchness of retribution."

三云：相如是、性如是，乃至報如是。

> **Third:** "The mark is thus, the nature is thus... down to the retribution is thus."

---

### The Three Truths in the Three Readings

若皆稱如者，如名不異，即空義也。

> If all are called "suchness"—the name "suchness" is not different—this is the meaning of **Emptiness**.

若作如是相、如是性者，點空相性，名字施設，邐迤不同，即假義也。

> If read as "suchness of mark, suchness of nature," pointing out empty marks and natures with conventional designations, each proceeding differently—this is the meaning of the **Provisional**.

若作相如是者，如於中道實相之是，即中義也。

> If read as "the mark is thus"—"thus" being the true mark of the Middle Way—this is the meaning of the **Middle**.

---

### Emptiness, Provisional, and Middle Are Mutually Inclusive

分別令易解故，明空、假、中，得意為言，空即假、中。

> For easy understanding, we distinguish Emptiness, Provisional, and Middle. But grasping the meaning: **Emptiness is precisely Provisional and Middle.**

約如明空，一空一切空。點如明相，一假一切假。就是論中，一中一切中，非一二三而一二三，不縱不橫，名為實相。

> From "suchness," clarify Emptiness—**one emptiness is all emptiness**. Pointing to "suchness," clarify marks—**one provisional is all provisional**. In terms of "thus," discuss the Middle—**one Middle is all Middle**. Neither one, two, three, yet one, two, three. Neither vertical nor horizontal—this is called **True Reality**.

唯佛與佛，究竟此法。

> **Only a Buddha and a Buddha can fathom this dharma.**

是十法，攝一切法。

> These **ten dharmas encompass all dharmas**.

---

## The Ten Dharma-Realms (十法界)

今明權實者，以十如是約十法界，謂六道、四聖也。

> Now to clarify Provisional and Real: the Ten Suchnesses in terms of the **Ten Dharma-Realms**—the Six Destinies and the Four Sagely [realms].

皆稱法界者，其意有三：

> All are called "Dharma-Realms"—the meaning has three aspects:

一、十數皆依法界，法界外更無復法。能、所合稱，故言十法界也。

> 1. All ten numbers depend on the Dharma-Realm; outside the Dharma-Realm there are no other dharmas. Combining the capable and what is capable—hence "Ten Dharma-Realms."

二、此十種法，分齊不同，因果隔別，凡聖有異，故加之以界也。

> 2. These ten kinds of dharmas differ in their divisions; cause and effect are separately distinguished; ordinary and sagely are different—hence "realm" is added.

三、此十皆即法界，攝一切法。一切法趣地獄，是趣不過。當體即理，更無所依，故名法界。

> 3. All ten are precisely the Dharma-Realm, encompassing all dharmas. All dharmas tend toward hell—the tending does not surpass [hell]. The very substance is principle; there is nothing further to depend on—hence "Dharma-Realm."[^6]

---

## The Hundred Realms and Thousand Suchnesses (百界千如)

此一法界具十如是，十法界具百如是。

> One Dharma-Realm possesses ten suchnesses. **Ten Dharma-Realms possess one hundred suchnesses.**

又一法界具九法界，則有百法界，千如是。

> Moreover, one Dharma-Realm contains nine Dharma-Realms—thus there are **one hundred Dharma-Realms** and **one thousand suchnesses**.

束為五差：一、惡。二、善。三、二乘。四、菩薩。五、佛。判為二法：前四是權法，後一是實法，細論各具權實，且依兩義。

> Grouped into five categories: (1) Evil, (2) Good, (3) Two Vehicles, (4) Bodhisattva, (5) Buddha. Classified into two dharmas: the first four are **Provisional Dharma**; the last one is **Real Dharma**. In detailed discussion, each contains both Provisional and Real; for now we follow the twofold meaning.

然此權實不可思議，乃是三世諸佛二智之境。

> Yet this Provisional and Real is inconceivable—it is the realm of the dual wisdom of the Buddhas of the Three Times.

---

## The Buddha's Perfect Knowledge

如來洞達，究十法底、盡十法邊，明識眾生：種、非種，芽、未芽，熟、不熟，可度脫、不可度脫，如實知之，無有錯謬。

> The Tathāgata penetrates thoroughly, fathoming the bottom of the ten dharmas, exhausting the boundaries of the ten dharmas. He clearly recognizes sentient beings: seeded or unseeded, sprouted or unsprouted, ripened or unripened, capable of liberation or incapable—**knowing them as they truly are, without error**.

殃掘摩羅雖是惡人，實相性熟，即時得度。四禪比丘雖是善人，惡性相熟，即不堪度。

> Aṅgulimāla, though an evil man, had his true-mark nature ripened—he was immediately ferried across. The monk of the Fourth Dhyāna, though a good man, had his evil-nature mark ripened—he was not capable of being ferried.

當知，眾生之法不可思議，雖實而權，雖權而實，實、權相即，不相妨礙。

> **Know this: Sentient Being Dharma is inconceivable.** Though Real, yet Provisional; though Provisional, yet Real. Real and Provisional mutually entail each other without obstruction.

不可以牛、羊眼觀視眾生，不可以凡夫心評量眾生。智如如來，乃能評量。何以故？眾生法妙故。

> One cannot view sentient beings with ox or sheep eyes. One cannot evaluate sentient beings with an ordinary person's mind. Only wisdom like the Tathāgata's can evaluate them. **Why? Because Sentient Being Dharma is Wonderful.**

## Footnotes

[^1]: The **Five Flavor Teachings** represent stages of the Buddha's teaching: Milk (*Avataṃsaka*), Curds (*Tripiṭaka*), Fresh Butter (*Vaipulya*), Clarified Butter (*Prajñā*), and Ghee (*Lotus/Nirvāṇa*).

[^2]: This is the famous statement of *tathāgatagarbha* (Buddha-nature) doctrine: the Buddha's knowledge and vision is already present within sentient beings.

[^3]: "All dharmas tend toward the eye; this tending does not surpass [the eye]" means that all dharmas are subsumed within each sense faculty—a statement of the mutual containment doctrine.

[^4]: "Mind, Buddha, and sentient beings—these three are without difference" (心佛及眾生，是三無差別) is one of the most famous statements in Mahāyāna Buddhism, foundational to Tiantai and Chan.

[^5]: The **Ten Suchnesses** (十如是) are a distinctive Tiantai reading of *Lotus Sūtra* Chapter 2. Kumārajīva's translation repeats "ru shi" (如是) ten times; Zhiyi interprets this as ten categories applicable to all dharmas.

[^6]: This triple interpretation of "Dharma-Realm" (法界) shows how each of the ten realms is (1) part of the totality, (2) distinct from others, and (3) complete in itself as principle.
