# Section 2: Citing Evidence (引證)

---

### Scriptural Evidence for the Name

○二、引證者，如文殊答問偈云「我見燈明佛，本光瑞如此，以是知今佛，欲說《法華經》」。

> Second, citing evidence: as Mañjuśrī replied in verse, "I saw the Buddha Lamp-Bright; the original auspicious light was just like this. From this I know the present Buddha intends to teach the *Lotus Sūtra*."[^1]

何但二萬億？大通智勝及五佛章中三世佛說，皆名「法華」也。

> Not only the two hundred trillion [Buddhas of the Lamp-Bright lineage]—the Great Pervasive Wisdom Excellence Buddha and the Three-World Buddhas in the Five Buddha Chapters—all taught what is named "Lotus."

文云「今佛放光明，助發實相義」，又云「諸法實相義，已為汝等說」，又云「無量眾所尊，為說實相印」。

> The text says: "Now the Buddha emits radiance to assist in revealing the meaning of true reality." And: "The meaning of the true reality of all dharmas has already been taught to you." And: "The one honored by immeasurable beings teaches the Real-Mark Seal."

此亦今古同以實相為體也。

> This also shows that past and present [Buddhas] alike take True Reality as the Substance.

---

### Scriptural Evidence for Essence and Function

文云「佛當雨法雨，充足求道者」，即是會三歸一之法雨，令求佛道因者充足，乃至一切皆會令充足。

> The text says: "The Buddha shall rain the Dharma rain, fulfilling those who seek the Way." This is the Dharma rain that integrates the Three into the One, causing those who seek the Buddha Way as *cause* to be fulfilled, and indeed causing all to be integrated and fulfilled.

若開近顯遠之法雨，令求佛道果者充足。

> If it is the Dharma rain that opens the near to reveal the remote, it causes those who seek the Buddha Way as *fruit* to be fulfilled.

文云「諸求三乘人，若有疑悔者，佛當為除斷，令盡無有餘」，又云「諸佛法久後，要當說真實」，即是斷三乘、五乘、七方便、九法界等疑，皆令生信。

> The text says: "Those seeking the Three Vehicles, if any have doubts or regrets, the Buddha shall eliminate them entirely, leaving nothing remaining." And: "The Dharma of all Buddhas, after a long time, must finally speak the truth." This is the elimination of doubts about the Three Vehicles, Five Vehicles, Seven Expedients, and Nine Dharma-Realms, causing all to give rise to faith.

此證經用也。

> This is evidence for the sūtra's Function.

---

### The "Supernatural Powers" Chapter Evidence

又〈如來神力品〉云「以要言之，如來一切所有之法，如來一切自在神力，如來一切祕要之藏，如來一切甚深之事，皆於此經宣示顯說」。

> The "Supernatural Powers of the Tathāgata" chapter says: "To speak in summary: all the Dharmas of the Tathāgata, all the sovereign supernatural powers of the Tathāgata, all the secret essential treasury of the Tathāgata, all the profound matters of the Tathāgata—all are proclaimed and revealed in this sūtra."[^2]

一切法者，權實一切法皆攝也，此證經名。

> "All Dharmas" means all Dharmas, both Provisional and Real, are included—this is evidence for the sūtra's **Name**.

一切自在神力者，內用名自在，外用名神力，即證用也。

> "All sovereign supernatural powers"—inner functioning is called sovereignty, outer functioning is called supernatural power—this is evidence for the **Function**.

一切祕要之藏者，非器莫授為祕，正體為要，多所含容而無積聚名藏，此證體也。

> "All the secret essential treasury"—not to grant to the unworthy vessel is called secret; the correct Substance is called essential; containing much yet without accumulation is called treasury—this is evidence for the **Substance**.

一切甚深之事者，實相名甚深，為實相修因名深因，究竟實相名深果。

> "All profound matters"—True Reality is called profound; cultivating causes for True Reality is called profound cause; ultimate True Reality is called profound fruit.

---

### The "Dharma Teacher" Chapter Evidence

又〈法師品〉云「若聞此經，乃是善行菩薩之道」，深因也。

> The "Dharma Teacher" chapter says: "If one hears this sūtra, this is the good practice of the bodhisattva path"—the profound cause.

「求佛道者，咸於我前聞《妙法華經》一句，乃至一念隨喜，我皆與授記。乃至須臾聞之，即得究竟三菩提深果。」

> "Those who seek the Buddha Way, who before me have heard even one phrase of the *Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sūtra*, or even given rise to a single thought of rejoicing—I give them all prediction [of Buddhahood]. Even those who hear it for just a moment immediately attain the profound fruit of ultimate *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*."[^3]

此證宗也。

> This is evidence for the **Essence**.

所以引二文者，古佛事定，舉要略以釋疑。今佛說竟，舉要略以付囑。中間正當機廣說，故不引證耳。若引者，「開、示、悟、入」，即其文也。「為大事因緣故」，證名；「佛之知見」，證體；「開示悟入」，證宗；「為令眾生」，證用；「此異餘經」，證教也。

> The reason for citing these two passages is that the affairs of past Buddhas are already settled, so we select essentials and briefly explain doubts. Now that the present Buddha has finished speaking, we again select essentials to entrust [the teaching]. The central portion directly addresses the capacities and is explained at length, so we do not cite it as evidence. If we were to cite it, "open, reveal, awaken, enter" is the passage. "For the sake of the great causal condition" evidences the Name; "the Buddha’s knowledge and vision" evidences the Substance; "open, reveal, awaken, enter" evidences the Essence; "in order to cause sentient beings" evidences the Function; "this differs from other sūtras" evidences the Teaching.

### The Six Similes from the "Medicine King" Chapter

又〈藥王品〉舉十譬歎教，今引其六：大如海，高如山，圓如月，照如日，自在如梵王、極如佛。

> The "Medicine King" chapter presents ten similes praising this Teaching. Now we cite six: **Great as the ocean**, **High as the mountain**, **Round as the moon**, **Brilliant as the sun**, **Sovereign as Brahma**, **Ultimate as Buddha**.

---

#### 1. Great as the Ocean (大如海)

海是坎德，萬流歸故，同一鹹故。《法華》亦爾，佛所證得，萬善同歸，同乘佛乘。

> The ocean has the virtue of receiving—all streams return to it; all share the same saltiness. The *Lotus Sūtra* is likewise: what the Buddha has realized, the ten thousand goods return to, all riding the One Buddha Vehicle.

江湖川流，無此大德，餘經亦爾，故《法華》最大也。

> Rivers and lakes do not have this great virtue; other sūtras are the same. Therefore the *Lotus* is the greatest.

---

#### 2. High as the Mountain (高如山)

山王最高，四寶所成故，純諸天居故。《法華》亦爾，在四味教之頂，離四誹謗，開、示、悟、入，純一根一緣，同一道味，純是菩薩，無聲聞弟子故。

> The Mountain King (Mount Sumeru) is highest, formed of four treasures, where only devas dwell. The *Lotus* is likewise: at the summit of the Four Flavor Teachings, free from the four slanders,[^4] opening, revealing, awakening, and entering—purely one root, one condition, one flavor of the Way—purely bodhisattvas, with no śrāvaka disciples.

---

#### 3. Round as the Moon (圓如月)

月能虧盈故，月漸圓故。《法華》亦爾，同體權實故，會漸入頓故。

> The moon can wax and wane; the moon gradually becomes full. The *Lotus* is likewise: the Provisional and Real share one substance; the gradual is integrated into the sudden.

---

#### 4. Brilliant as the Sun (照如日)

燈、炬、星、月與闇共住，譬諸經存二乘道果，與小並立，日能破闇故。

> Lamps, torches, stars, and moon coexist with darkness—this metaphors how other sūtras preserve the Two Vehicle paths and fruits, allowing the small to stand alongside. The sun can destroy darkness.

《法華》破化城，除草庵故。又日映奪星月，令不現故。《法華》拂迹，除方便故。

> The *Lotus* destroys the Conjured City and removes the Grass Hut. The sun outshines stars and moon, making them invisible. The *Lotus* removes the traces and dispenses with skillful means.

---

#### 5. Sovereign as Brahma (自在如梵王)

輪王於四域自在，釋王於三十三天自在，大梵於三界自在。諸經或於俗諦自在，或於真諦自在，或於中道自在；但是歷別自在，非大自在。

> A wheel-turning king is sovereign over the four continents; Śakra is sovereign over the Thirty-Three Heavens; Great Brahma is sovereign over the Three Realms. Other sūtras may be sovereign in conventional truth, or in ultimate truth, or in the Middle Way—but these are all separate sovereignties, not great sovereignty.

今經三諦圓融，最得自在，譬大梵王。

> This present sūtra's Three Truths are perfectly interfused, achieving the greatest sovereignty—metaphorically, the Great Brahma King.

---

#### 6. Ultimate as Buddha (極如佛)

餘經拔眾生出生死，如五佛子，於凡夫第一。或拔眾生出涅槃，如菩薩居無學上。今經拔出眾生，過方便教菩薩上，即成法王，最為第一。

> Other sūtras deliver beings from birth-and-death, like the Five Buddha Sons, who are first among ordinary beings. Or they deliver beings from nirvāṇa, like bodhisattvas who dwell above the non-learners. This present sūtra delivers beings beyond the bodhisattvas of the expedient teachings, immediately becoming Dharma Kings—the ultimate first.

引諸譬喻，明教相最大。例知用、宗、體、名，亦大如海，境智乃至利益，亦大如海。教相如山，在四味教上，用、宗、體、名、境、智、利益，亦復如是。教相虧盈圓滿，如月；用、宗、體、名、境、智、利益，亦復如是。教破化城，用、宗、體、名、境、智、利益，亦復如是。教相自在，餘亦如是。教相王中王，餘亦如是。非但引文證教，餘義亦成。

> These similes clarify that the Teaching Classification is greatest. By analogy we know Function, Essence, Substance, and Name are likewise great as the ocean; realm and wisdom, up to benefits, are also great as the ocean. The Teaching Classification is like a mountain, above the Four-Flavor teachings; Function, Essence, Substance, Name, realm, wisdom, and benefits are likewise. The Teaching Classification waxes and wanes to fullness like the moon; Function, Essence, Substance, Name, realm, wisdom, and benefits are likewise. The Teaching Classification breaks the Conjured City; Function, Essence, Substance, Name, realm, wisdom, and benefits are likewise. The Teaching Classification is sovereign; the rest are likewise. The Teaching Classification is king of kings; the rest are likewise. Thus it is not only that cited texts evidence the Teaching; the other meanings are also established.

---

## ○三、生起
# Section 3: Demonstrating the Arising (生起)

---

○三、生起者，能生為生，所生為起。前後有次第，麁細不相違。

> Third, arising: "that which generates" is called *arising*; "that which is generated" is called *starting*. There is a sequence from before to after; coarse and subtle do not conflict.

肇云：「名無召物之功，物無應名之實。無名無物，名、物安在？」蓋第一義中無相意耳。

> [Sēng]zhào said: "Names have no power to summon things; things have no reality to respond to names. If there are no names and no things, where are names and things?" This is the meaning of no-marks in the first principle.

世諦為言，無名無以顯法，故初釋名。名，名於法，法即是體，尋名識體；體非宗不會，會體自行已圓，從體起用，導利含識；利益既多，須分別教相也。

> Speaking in terms of conventional truth: without names, there is no way to reveal the Dharma—hence we first interpret the Name. Names designate the Dharma; the Dharma is the Substance. Following names, we recognize the Substance. The Substance cannot be integrated without the Essence. Integrating the Substance, self-practice is already complete. From the Substance arises Function, guiding and benefiting sentient beings. Since the benefits are many, we must distinguish the Teaching Classification.

〈神力品〉中，約教次第，一切法本皆佛法。《大經》云「一切世諦，若於如來，即是第一義諦。」眾生顛倒，謂非佛法，今明言示之，故言一切法也。

> In the "Supernatural Powers" chapter, in terms of teaching sequence, all dharmas are originally Buddha‑dharma. The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "All worldly truths, with respect to the Tathāgata, are precisely First-Principle Truth." Sentient beings are inverted and claim they are not Buddha‑dharma; now we clarify and state it—therefore it is said "all dharmas."

欲說此法，先以神力駭動，故言一切自在神力。既見變通，醒悟渴仰，得為說教，教詮實相，故言祕密之藏也。稟教修行，即有因果，故言甚深之事也。欲分別四義與餘經同異，次明教相耳。

> To speak this dharma, one first uses supernatural power to startle—therefore it is said "all sovereign supernatural powers." Having seen the transformations, [beings] awaken and thirst, so the teaching can be spoken. The teaching expresses true reality—therefore it is called the secret treasury. Receiving the teaching and cultivating, there are causes and fruits—therefore it is called profound matters. To distinguish how the four meanings are the same or different from other sūtras, next we clarify the Teaching Classification.

---

### The Arising According to "Open, Reveal, Awaken, Enter"

〈序品〉約行次第，初從經卷，若善知識，有所聞見，即聞名也。聞故推理體顯，顯體須行，行即因果，宗也。行自排惑，亦利眾生，是用也。分別同異，教相也。

> In the "Introduction" chapter, in terms of the sequence of practice: first, starting from the scrolls of the sūtra—if a good spiritual friend has something heard and seen, this is hearing the Name. Hearing thus pushes one to principle; the Substance is revealed. Revealing the Substance requires practice; practice is cause and fruit—this is the Essence. Practice itself dispels delusion and also benefits sentient beings—this is the Function. Distinguishing sameness and difference is the Teaching Classification.

開、示、悟、入，亦約行次第，法本無開閉，今呼為方便門開，此聞名也。示真實相，體也。自迷得悟，悟因也。由因故悟果，宗也。悟故深入，亦令他入，用也。分別同異，教也。

> "Open, reveal, awaken, enter"—this also follows the sequence of practice. The Dharma originally has neither opening nor closing; now we call it "opening the gate of skillful means"—this is hearing the **Name**. "Revealing the marks of true reality"—the **Substance**. "Being confused yet attaining awakening"—awakening to the **cause**. "Due to cause, awakening to fruit"—the **Essence**. "Awakening, one deeply enters and causes others to enter"—the **Function**. "Distinguishing sameness and difference"—the **Teaching**.

今之五義，依〈序品〉扶行次第也。

> These five meanings follow the sequence of practice supported by the "Introduction" chapter.

---

## ○四、開合
# Section 4: Opening and Combining (開合)

---

○四、開合者，五章共釋一經，種種分別，令易解故。凡三種開合，謂五種、十種、譬喻。

> Fourth, opening and combining: the Five Chapters together interpret one sūtra. Various distinctions are made for ease of understanding. There are three kinds of opening and combining: the five kinds, the ten kinds, and simile.

---

### The Five-Kind Opening

初、釋名通論事、理，顯體專論理，宗、用但論事，教相分別事、理。

> First: Interpreting the Name discusses both phenomena and principle. Discerning the Substance discusses only principle. Essence and Function discuss only phenomena. Teaching Classification distinguishes phenomena and principle.

釋名通說教行，顯體非教、非行，宗、用但行，教相但教。

> Interpreting the Name discusses both teaching and practice. Discerning the Substance is neither teaching nor practice. Essence and Function are only practice. Teaching Classification is only teaching.

釋名通說因果，顯體非因、非果，宗自因果，用教他因果，教相分別上法耳。

> Interpreting the Name discusses both cause and effect. Discerning the Substance is neither cause nor effect. Essence is self-practice cause-and-effect. Function teaches others cause-and-effect. Teaching Classification distinguishes the above dharmas.

釋名通論自行、化他，體非自、非他，宗是自行，用是化他，教相分別自、他。

> Interpreting the Name generally discusses self‑practice and transforming others. The Substance is neither self nor other. Essence is self‑practice; Function is transforming others. Teaching Classification distinguishes self and other.

釋名通論說默，體非說、非默，宗默、用說，教相分別(云云)。

> Interpreting the Name generally discusses speaking and silence. The Substance is neither speaking nor silence. Essence is silence; Function is speaking. Teaching Classification distinguishes them (and so on).

十種者，釋名總論三軌：體、宗、用開對三軌，教相分別三軌。釋名總論三道：體、宗、用開對三道，教相分別三道。乃至第十，釋名總論三德：體、宗、用開對三德，教相分別三德(云云)。

> As for the ten kinds: Interpreting the Name generally discusses the three tracks; Substance, Essence, and Function open and correspond to the three tracks; Teaching Classification distinguishes the three tracks. Interpreting the Name generally discusses the three paths; Substance, Essence, and Function open and correspond to the three paths; Teaching Classification distinguishes the three paths. Up to the tenth: Interpreting the Name generally discusses the three virtues; Substance, Essence, and Function open and correspond to the three virtues; Teaching Classification distinguishes the three virtues (and so on).

---

### The Simile: The Human Body

譬喻者，譬如總名人身，開身則有識、命、煖，分別諸身貴、賤、賢、愚，種種差降。人身譬名，識以譬體，命以譬宗，煖以譬用，分別譬教相(云云)。

> **Simile**: It is like the general designation "human body." Opening the body, there are consciousness, life, and warmth; distinguishing various bodies—noble or base, wise or foolish—there are various gradations. The **human body** metaphors the **Name**. **Consciousness** metaphors the **Substance**. **Life** metaphors the **Essence**. **Warmth** metaphors the **Function**. **Distinguishing** metaphors the **Teaching Classification**.

---

## ○五、料簡
# Section 5: Critical Discrimination (料簡)

---

○五料簡者，

> Fifth, critical discrimination.


### Q1: Doesn't "flower for the lotus" imply cause contains effect?

問：若為蓮故華，華果必俱，將不墮因中有果耶？

> **Q:** If "the flower exists for the sake of the lotus" and flower and fruit necessarily coexist, doesn't this fall into [the Sāṃkhya heresy of] "effect within cause"?

答：因中有果，舊醫邪法，已為初教所破，尚非麁權實義，況是妙因妙果、新醫真乳法邪？

> **A:** "Effect within cause" is the old physician's heretical doctrine, already refuted by the initial teaching. It is not even the coarse meaning of Provisional and Real—how much less the wonderful cause and wonderful fruit of the new physician's true milk Dharma!

---

### Q2: If the flower metaphors the Provisional, why destroy the Grass Hut?

問：華以喻權，權是小乘之法，則不應破於草庵。草庵既破，何得以華喻權？

> **Q:** If the flower metaphors the Provisional, and the Provisional is the Small Vehicle dharma, then it should not destroy the Grass Hut. Since the Grass Hut is destroyed, how can the flower metaphor the Provisional?

答：小乘是化他之權，是故須破。今明自行之權，故以華喻耳。

> **A:** The Small Vehicle is the **expedient for transforming others**—therefore it must be destroyed. Now we clarify the **expedient of self-practice**—hence the flower is used as metaphor.

問：文內從火宅至醫子，凡七譬，悉不明蓮華，何以取此為題？

> **Q:** Within the text, from the Burning House to the Physician’s Son, there are seven similes in all—none explicitly clarify “lotus.” Why take this as the title?

答：七譬是別，蓮華是總，舉總攝別，故冠篇首也。

> **A:** The seven similes are particular; the lotus is general. We raise the general to encompass the particulars—therefore it crowns the beginning of the chapter.

問：一切法皆佛法，何意簡權取實為體？

> **Q:** All dharmas are Buddha‑dharma—why simplify by discarding the Provisional and taking the Real as the Substance?

答：若開權顯實，諸法皆體；若廢權顯實，如前所用。

> **A:** If one opens the Provisional to reveal the Real, all dharmas are Substance. If one abandons the Provisional to reveal the Real, it is as previously used.

問：何故雙用因果為宗？

> **Q:** Why use both cause and fruit as the Essence?

答：由因致果，果為因所辦。若從能辦，以因為宗；若從所辦，以果為宗。二義本是相成，不得單取。又迹本二文，俱說因果故。

> **A:** Cause leads to fruit; fruit is accomplished by cause. If one takes what accomplishes, then cause is Essence; if one takes what is accomplished, then fruit is Essence. The two meanings complete each other and cannot be taken singly. Moreover, both the Trace and Fundamental texts speak of cause and fruit.

問：論宗簡化他因果，明用俱取自他權實？

> **Q:** In discussing the Essence, we simplify by excluding other‑transforming cause and fruit. In discussing Function, why take both self‑ and other‑transforming Provisional and Real?

答：宗論自行，故須簡他，用是益他，是故雙取。

> **A:** The Essence discusses self‑practice, therefore we must exclude the other. Function benefits others; therefore it takes both.

又問：用是化他，亦不須自行權實？

> **Q (again):** Since Function is transforming others, need we not also exclude self‑practice Provisional and Real?

答：欲以自利、利他故。

> **A:** Because we wish to benefit self and benefit others.

並宗亦應然，欲自行化他因果，是故應取他也？答：

> **Q:** Then the Essence should also be so—if we wish self‑practice that transforms others by cause and fruit, should we not take the other as well?

答：化他因果，不能致佛菩提，是故不取。

> **A:** Other‑transforming cause and fruit cannot lead to Buddha‑bodhi; therefore we do not take them.

並用他權實，亦不能令他至極，亦不應取？

> **Q:** And the other’s Provisional and Real in Function cannot bring others to the ultimate—so should we not also exclude them?

答：他宜須此利，是故取也。

> **A:** Others’ capacities need these benefits; therefore we take them.

問：宗、用俱明智斷，云何分別？

> **Q:** Essence and Function both clarify wisdom and severance—how are they distinguished?

答：自行以智德為宗，斷德為用，若化他、自行，智斷俱為宗，化他，智斷俱為用。

> **A:** For self‑practice, wisdom‑virtue is Essence and severance‑virtue is Function. For transforming others and self‑practice, wisdom and severance together are Essence; for transforming others, wisdom and severance together are Function.

---

### Q3: Why five chapters, not four or six?

問：何故五章，不四不六？

> **Q:** Why five chapters, not four or six?

答：設作四六，亦復生疑，墮無窮問，非也。

> **A:** If we made it four or six, doubt would likewise arise, falling into infinite questioning. This is not [the point].

問：經經各有異意，那得五義共釋眾經耶？

> **Q:** Each sūtra has its own distinct intent—how can the Five Meanings jointly interpret all sūtras?

答：若經經別釋，但得別，不得同。今共論五義，得同不失別。

> **A:** If each sūtra were interpreted separately, one would gain only difference and not sameness. Now by jointly discussing the Five Meanings, we gain sameness without losing difference.

---

## ○六、觀心
# Section 6: Observing the Mind (觀心)

---

○六明觀心者，從標章至料簡，悉明觀心。

> Section Six clarifies observing the mind: from the establishing of headings through critical discrimination, all of it clarifies observing the mind.


### The Mind and the Title

心如幻焰，但有名字，名之為心。適言其有，不見色質；適言其無，復起慮想。不可以有、無思度故，故名心為「妙」。

> The mind is like a magical flame—it merely has a name; it is called "mind." Just when you say it exists, you don't see its form or substance. Just when you say it doesn't exist, thoughts arise again. Because it cannot be measured by existence or non-existence, the mind is called **"Wonderful"** (妙).

妙心可軌，稱之為「法」。

> The wonderful mind can be a guiding standard—it is called **"Dharma"** (法).

心法非因、非果，能如理觀，即辦因果，是名「蓮華」。

> The dharma of mind is neither cause nor effect; yet when contemplated in accord with principle, it accomplishes cause and effect—this is called **"Lotus Flower"** (蓮華).

由一心成觀，亦轉教餘心，名之為「經」。

> Through one mind, contemplation is accomplished, and it transforms to teach other minds—this is called **"Sūtra"** (經).

釋名竟。

> This completes the interpretation of the Name.

---

### The Mind as Substance, Essence, Function

心本無名，亦無無名。心名不生，亦復不滅，心即實相。

> The mind originally has no name, nor is it "no-name." The name of mind is not arising, nor is it ceasing. **The mind is True Reality.**

初觀為因，觀成為果。

> Initial contemplation is **cause**; accomplished contemplation is **fruit**.

以觀心故，惡覺不起。心數塵勞，若同若異，皆被化而轉，是為觀心。

> Because of contemplating the mind, evil thoughts do not arise. The mental factors and afflictions, whether same or different, are all transformed—this is contemplating the mind.

標五章竟。

> This completes the marking of the five chapters.

觀心引證者，《釋論》云「一陰名色，四陰名名，心但是名也。」《大經》云「能觀心性，名為上定。上定者，第一義定。」證心是體。《大經》云：「夫有心者，皆當得三菩提。」心是宗也。《遺教》云：「制心一處，無事不辦。」心是用也。《釋論》云：「三界無別法，唯是一心作。」心能地獄、心能天堂，心能凡夫、心能賢聖。覺觀心是語本，以心分別於心，證心是教相也。

> As for citing evidence for observing the mind: the *Treatise* says, "One aggregate is called form; four aggregates are called name; mind is only name." The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says, "Able to contemplate mind‑nature is called the highest samādhi. The highest samādhi is the First‑Principle samādhi." This evidences that mind is the Substance. The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "All who have mind should attain the three bodhi." Mind is the Essence. The *Bequeathed Teachings* says: "If one controls the mind in one place, there is nothing that cannot be accomplished." Mind is the Function. The *Treatise* says: "In the three realms there is no separate dharma; only one mind makes [them]." Mind can be hell; mind can be heaven; mind can be ordinary beings; mind can be sages. Awareness and contemplation of mind are the root of speech; using mind to discriminate mind—this evidences mind as the Teaching Classification.

觀心生起者，以心觀心，由能觀心，有所觀境。以觀契境故，從心得解脫故。若一心得解脫，能令一切數皆得解脫故。分別心王、心數，同起、偏起等，即是教相故。

> As for the arising of observing the mind: use mind to observe mind. Because there is a mind that can observe, there is an observed realm. Because contemplation accords with the realm, liberation arises from mind. If one mind attains liberation, it can cause all mental factors to attain liberation. Distinguishing mind‑king and mind‑factors, arising together or arising partially—this is the Teaching Classification.

觀心開合者，心是諸法之本，心即總也。別說有三種心：煩惱心是三支；苦果心是七支；業心是二支。苦心即法身，是心體；煩惱心即般若，是心宗；業心即解脫，是心用：即開心為三也。分別十二因緣心生，即有六道差降。分別心滅，即有四聖高下，是為教相兼於開合也。

> As for opening and combining in observing the mind: mind is the root of all dharmas—mind is the general. Distinctly, there are three kinds of mind: the affliction‑mind is the three branches; the suffering‑fruit mind is the seven branches; the karma‑mind is the two branches. The suffering mind is precisely the Dharma‑body—this is the mind’s Substance. The affliction‑mind is precisely prajñā—this is the mind’s Essence. The karma‑mind is precisely liberation—this is the mind’s Function. This is opening mind into three. Distinguishing the twelve‑link dependent‑origination mind as arising, there are the six destinies’ gradations. Distinguishing mind as ceasing, there are the four sages’ high and low—this is the Teaching Classification in terms of opening and combining.

> Once explanation by phenomena is sufficient, why bother observing the mind?

答：

> **A:**

《大論》云「佛為信行人，以樹為喻；為法行人，以身為喻。」今亦如是，為文字人，約事解釋；為坐禪人，作觀心解。又《論》作四句評「有慧無多聞，是不知實相，譬如大闇中，有目無所見；多聞無智慧，亦不知實相，譬如大明中，有燈而無照；多聞利智慧，是所說應受；無聞無智慧，是名人身牛。」今使聞、慧兼修，義、觀雙舉，《百論》有盲跛之譬，《牟子》有說行之義。

> The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Śāstra* says: "The Buddha used a tree as a simile for those who practice by faith; he used the body as a simile for those who practice by Dharma." Now it is also thus: for those of letters, explain by way of phenomena; for those who sit in meditation, make an explanation of observing the mind. Also, the *Treatise* makes a four‑phrase appraisal: "With wisdom but no much learning—this is not knowing true reality; it is like in great darkness, with eyes yet nothing seen. With much learning but no wisdom—also not knowing true reality; it is like in great brightness, with a lamp yet no illumination. Much learning and benefiting wisdom—what is spoken should be received. No learning and no wisdom—this is called a human‑bodied ox." Now we make hearing and wisdom practice together, meaning and contemplation raised together. The *Hundred Treatise* has the simile of the blind and the lame; the *Mouzi* has the meaning of speaking and practice.

### The Balance of Study and Practice

《華嚴》云「譬如貧窮人，日夜數他寶，自無半錢分」，偏聞之失也。

> The *Avataṃsaka* says: "Like a poor person who day and night counts others' treasures yet has not half a coin"—this is the fault of **one-sided study**.

下文云「未得謂得，未證謂證」，偏觀之失也。

> The text below says: "Claiming attainment without attainment, claiming realization without realization"—this is the fault of **one-sided meditation**.

何者？視聽馳散，如風中燈，照物不了。但貴耳入口出，都不治心，自是陵人，增見長非，把刃自傷，解牽惡道，由其不習觀也。若觀心人，謂即心而是，已則均佛。都不尋經論，墮增上慢，此則抱炬自燒，行牽惡道，由不習聞也。

> Why? Seeing and hearing race and scatter, like a lamp in the wind—its illumination does not reach objects. Merely valuing ear‑in and mouth‑out, one never treats the mind; one thereby belittles others, increases views and grows wrongs, grasps a blade and injures oneself, and drags oneself toward evil paths—because one has not practiced contemplation. If one observes the mind and claims that mind is it, one then is equal to Buddha. Never seeking sūtras or śāstras, one falls into arrogance. This is like holding a torch and burning oneself, one’s conduct dragging one to evil paths—because one has not practiced hearing.

若欲免貧窮，當勤三觀；欲免上慢，當聞六即。

> If you wish to escape poverty, diligently practice the Three Contemplations. If you wish to escape arrogance, learn of the Six Stages.

世間相常住，理即也。

> "The worldly marks are eternally abiding"—this is **Identity in Principle** (理即).

於諸過去佛，若有聞一句，名字即也。

> "If regarding all past Buddhas, one has heard even a single phrase"—this is **Identity in Name** (名字即).

深信隨喜，觀行即也。

> "Deep faith and rejoicing"—this is **Identity in Contemplative Practice** (觀行即).

六根清淨，相似即也。

> "Six sense faculties purified"—this is **Identity in Resemblance** (相似即).

安住實智中，分證即也。

> "Abiding in real wisdom"—this is **Identity in Partial Realization** (分證即).

唯佛與佛究盡實相，究竟即也。

> "Only a Buddha and a Buddha can fathom the reality of all dharmas"—this is **Identity in Ultimate Realization** (究竟即).

修心內觀，則有法財；正信外聞，無復上慢。眼慧明聞，具足利益，何得不觀解耶？

> Cultivating inner contemplation of mind, one has Dharma wealth. With correct faith and external hearing, there is no more arrogance. With the eye of wisdom illuminating what is heard, one fully benefits. How could one not contemplate and understand?

### The Four Siddhāntas and the Five Chapters

問：佛有所說，依四悉檀。今解五義，與彼會不？

> **Q:** The Buddha's teaching depends on the Four Siddhāntas. Does our present interpretation of the Five Meanings accord with those?

答：此義今當說，先對五章，次解四悉檀。

> **A:** This meaning shall now be explained. First, we correlate [the Four Siddhāntas] with the Five Chapters; next, we explain the Four Siddhāntas.

世界悉檀對釋名。名該一部，世界亦冠於三。

> **Worldly Siddhānta** corresponds to **Interpreting the Name**. The Name encompasses the entire text; the Worldly likewise crowns the [other] three.

第一義對體，最分明。

> **First-Principle Siddhānta** corresponds to **Substance**—this is most clear.

為人對宗，宗論因果，為人生善，義同。

> **For-Each-Person Siddhānta** corresponds to **Essence**. The Essence discusses cause and effect; "For Each Person" generates good—the meaning is the same.

對治對用，用破疑滯，與治病事齊。

> **Therapeutic Siddhānta** corresponds to **Function**. Function breaks through doubt and stagnation; treating illness is its equivalent.

分別悉檀對教相，教相如後說。

> **Distinguishing Siddhānta** corresponds to **Teaching Classification**, as explained later.

問：何不次第？

> **Q:** Why is the sequence not in order?

答：悉檀是佛智慧，對利鈍緣則成四種。利人聞世界解第一義，此對釋名辨體即足。若鈍人未悟，更須為人生善、對治破惡，乃入第一義，則具用四也。五重玄義，意兼利鈍。四悉檀法，專為鈍者，對義是同，次第則異。

> **A:** The Siddhāntas are the Buddha’s wisdom; according to sharp or dull capacities they become four kinds. A sharp person hears the Worldly and understands the First Principle—this suffices for Interpreting the Name and Discerning the Substance. If a dull person has not awakened, one must further generate good for persons and apply treatment to break evil, and only then enter the First Principle—thus the Function includes four. The five‑fold profound meaning has intent that includes sharp and dull. The four Siddhāntas are specifically for the dull; the meanings correspond but the sequence differs.

問：《論》專釋《大品》，不涉《法華》，何得指彼悉檀通此五義？《中論》通申諸經，何意不用？

> **Q:** The *Treatise* exclusively explains the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā* and does not touch the *Lotus*; how can we point to those Siddhāntas as applying to these Five Meanings? The *Madhyamaka-śāstra* universally elucidates sūtras—why not use it?

答：《釋論》云「四悉檀攝八萬法藏、十二部經」，《法華》何得不預耶！《中論》通申，理宜須用。若具引論，博而未巧。今取論題，申於五章，「中」字申體，「觀」字申宗，「論」字申用。《纓珞》云「破法方便、立法方便、利益眾生方便。」《論》有研覈、破執，立三寶、四諦，得四沙門果，故知「論」字申用。中觀理不可思議，申「妙」。觀境是權實，申「法」。觀智是因果，申「蓮華」。觀詮，申「經」。論之三字，合四悉檀，以對五義，通申意顯。若更以論申餘經者，取偈初句申三藏，次句申通，次句申別，次句申圓。《法華》又為第四句所申也。豈止兩論申此五章，五章通申諸經論也。

> **A:** The *Treatise* says, "The Four Siddhāntas encompass the eighty‑four thousand Dharma‑collections and the twelve divisions of scripture"—how could the *Lotus* be excluded? The *Madhyamaka‑śāstra* universally explicates; in principle it should be used. If we fully cite treatises, it is broad but not skillful. Now we take the title of the *Treatise* to explicate the Five Chapters: the character *zhong* (中) explicates Substance, *guan* (觀) explicates Essence, and *lun* (論) explicates Function. The *Yingluo* says "expedient to destroy dharmas, expedient to establish dharmas, expedient to benefit sentient beings." The *Treatise* has examination and refutation of attachments, establishes the Three Jewels and Four Truths, and attains the four śramaṇa fruits—thus the character *lun* explicates Function. The inconceivable principle of “Middle Contemplation” explicates “Wonderful.” Contemplating the realm is Provisional and Real—this explicates “Dharma.” Contemplating wisdom is cause and fruit—this explicates “Lotus.” Contemplating expression explicates “Sūtra.” The three characters of the *Treatise* combine the Four Siddhāntas to correspond to the Five Meanings; the general intent becomes clear. If one further uses the *Treatise* to explicate other sūtras, the first line of the gāthā explicates the Tripiṭaka, the next line the Common, the next the Distinct, the next the Perfect. The *Lotus* is again explicated by the fourth line. How could it be only these two treatises that explicate the Five Chapters? The Five Chapters universally explicate all sūtras and treatises.

次解四悉檀為十重：

> Next, the Four Siddhāntas are explained in ten layers:

　一、釋名　二、辨相　三、釋成　四、對諦　五、起教觀　六、說默　七、用不用　八、權實　九、開顯　十、通經

> 1. Interpreting the name  2. Discriminating the marks  3. Explaining the establishment  4. Corresponding to the truths  5. Arousing teaching and contemplation  6. Speaking and silence  7. Use and non‑use  8. Provisional and Real  9. Opening and revealing  10. Pervading the sūtras

---

### What Are the Four Siddhāntas?

釋名者，悉檀，天竺語。一云：此無翻，例如脩多羅多含；一云：翻為宗、成、墨、印、實、成就、究竟等，莫知孰是。《地持．菩提分品》說：「一切行無常，一切行苦，一切法無我，涅槃寂滅，是名四優檀那。」此翻為印，亦翻為宗。印是楷定，不可改易。佛菩薩具此法，復以傳教，此就教釋印。如經世智所說，有無無二此法楷定，以此傳授，經過去寂默諸牟尼尊展轉相傳，此就行釋印也。經增上、踊出，乃至出第一有，最上，眾共歸仰，世間所無，此釋宗義。彼明文了義釋優檀那，諸師何得用宗印翻四悉檀？如此既謬，餘翻亦叵信。

> As for interpreting the name: *siddhānta* is an Indic term. One says it is untranslated, like “sūtra” and “āgama.” Another says it is translated as宗, 成, 墨, 印, 實, 成就, 究竟, and so forth—no one knows which is correct. The *Dìchí*’s “Bodhi‑limb Chapter” says: “All formations are impermanent, all formations are suffering, all dharmas are without self, nirvāṇa is quiescent extinction—this is called the four *udanā*.” This is translated as “seal,” and also as “essence.” A seal is fixed and cannot be changed. Buddhas and bodhisattvas possess this dharma and transmit it as teaching; in terms of teaching this explains the “seal.” As said by worldly wisdom: the dharma of existence and non‑existence, non‑dual, is fixed; it is transmitted through that, passed down among the silent muni venerables of the past—this explains the seal in terms of practice. The sūtra rises above, springs forth, even beyond the first existence; it is supreme, revered by all, without equal in the world—this explains the meaning of essence. Since that text clearly explains *udanā*, how can teachers use “essence” and “seal” to translate the Four Siddhāntas? If this is already mistaken, the other translations are likewise not trustworthy.

南岳師，例「大涅槃」，梵、漢兼稱。「悉」是此言，「檀」是梵語，悉之言遍，檀翻為施。佛以四法，遍施眾生，故言悉檀也。

> Master Nanyue, following the example of "*Mahāparinirvāṇa*," used both Sanskrit and Chinese together. "Xī" (悉) is Chinese [meaning "universal"]; "tán" (檀) is Sanskrit [*dāna*, meaning "giving"]. "Xī" means "universally"; "tán" translates as "giving." The Buddha universally gives four dharmas to sentient beings—hence the term *siddhānta* (悉檀).

#### 1. Worldly Siddhānta (世界悉檀)

世界如車，輪、輻、軸、輞和合故有車，無別車也。五眾和合故有人，無別人也。

> The world is like a cart: wheels, spokes, axle, and rim combine to give rise to "cart"—there is no separate cart. The five aggregates combine to give rise to "person"—there is no separate person.

若無人者，佛是實語人，云何言：「我見六道眾生」？當知有人。

> If there were no person, the Buddha would be a speaker of falsehoods—how could he say, "I see sentient beings in the six destinies"? Therefore know that there is a person.

人者，世界故有，非第一義；第一義可是實，餘不應實。答：各各實。如如法性等，世界故無，第一義故有。人等，第一義故無，世界故有。

> A person exists because of the world and is not the First Principle; the First Principle can be real, while the rest should not be real. Answer: each is real in its own way. Suchness, dharma‑nature, and the like are not [real] in terms of the world but are [real] in terms of the First Principle. Persons and the like are not [real] in terms of the First Principle but are [real] in terms of the world.

有於五陰、十二入、十八界，一切名相隔別，名為世界。

> The existence of the five aggregates, twelve bases, and eighteen realms, with all their names and marks separately distinguished—this is called "world."

外人迷此世界，不達法相，或計無因緣有世界，或計邪因緣有世界。大聖隨順眾生所欲樂聞，分別為說正因緣世界法，令得世間正見，是名世界悉檀相。

> Outsiders are deluded about this world and do not understand dharma‑marks: some reckon the world exists without causes and conditions; some reckon it exists by wrong causes and conditions. The Great Sage, following what sentient beings delight to hear, discriminates and teaches the dharma of the world through correct causes and conditions, enabling them to gain correct worldly views—this is called the mark of the Worldly Siddhānta.


---

#### 2. For-Each-Person Siddhānta (為人悉檀)

大聖觀人心而為說法，人心各各不同，於一事中或聽或不聽。

> The Great Sage observes people's minds and teaches accordingly. People's minds differ; regarding one matter, some listen and some do not.

如雜業故，雜生世間，得雜觸雜受。更有《破群那經》說無人得觸，無人得受。為二人疑後世，不信罪福，墮斷常中，故作此說。

> Because of mixed karma, beings are born in the world in mixed ways, receiving mixed contacts and mixed feelings. Further, the *Poqunna* sūtra says that no person attains contact and no person attains feeling. Because two kinds of people doubt the afterlife, do not believe in罪 and福, and fall into annihilation and permanence, this statement is made.

此意傍為破執，正是生信。增長善根，施其善法也。故名各各為人悉檀。

> The secondary purpose is to break attachments; the primary purpose is to generate faith, increase good roots, and bestow wholesome dharmas. Hence it is called the "For Each Person" Siddhānta.

---

#### 3. Therapeutic Siddhānta (對治悉檀)

有法對治則有、實性則無。對治者：貪欲多，教觀不淨；瞋恚多，教修慈心；愚癡多，教觀因緣。

> There are dharmas that exist as treatment but have no inherent nature. Treatment means: for excessive greed, teach contemplation of impurity; for excessive anger, teach cultivation of loving-kindness; for excessive delusion, teach contemplation of causation.

對治惡病，說此法藥，遍施眾生，故名對治悉檀相也。

> Treating evil diseases, teaching this Dharma medicine, universally giving to sentient beings—this is the mark of the Therapeutic Siddhānta.

---

#### 4. First-Principle Siddhānta (第一義悉檀)

有二種：一、不可說；二、可說。

> There are two kinds: (1) the inexpressible; (2) the expressible.

不可說者，即是諸佛、辟支佛、羅漢所得真實法。引偈云：「言論盡竟，心行亦訖，不生不滅，法如涅槃。」

> The inexpressible is what all Buddhas, pratyekabuddhas, and arhats realize as true reality. A verse says: "Speech and discourse come to an end; mental activity also ceases. Neither arising nor ceasing—the Dharma is like nirvāṇa."

說諸行處，名世界；說不行處，名第一義。

> Teaching where activities proceed is called "world." Teaching where [activities] do not proceed is called "First Principle."

約可說者，一切實、一切不實、一切亦實亦不實、一切非實非不實，皆名諸法之實相。

> Regarding the expressible: "All is real," "All is unreal," "All is both real and unreal," "All is neither real nor unreal"—these are all names for the True Mark of all dharmas.[^6]

佛於如是等處處經中說第一義悉檀相，此亦是一家明四門入實之意。

> The Buddha, in such passages throughout the sūtras, speaks the First‑Principle Siddhānta mark; this is also the meaning of one school’s clarification of entering the Real through the four gates.

故《中論》云：「為向道人說四句，如快馬見鞭影即入正路。」

> Therefore the *Madhyamaka-śāstra* says: "For one who is heading toward the Way, explain the four phrases; like a swift horse seeing the shadow of the whip, they immediately enter the correct path."

若聞四句，心生取著，皆是戲論，豈第一義耶？

> But if upon hearing the four phrases, the mind gives rise to grasping—this is all idle talk. How is this the First Principle?

私十五番釋其相令易解：隨說事理，聞者適悅是世界；舊善心生是為人；新惡除遣是對治；得悟聖道是第一義。

> I privately explain their marks in fifteen ways to make them easy to understand: following the teaching of phenomena and principle, if the hearer is suitably pleased, this is Worldly; if old good minds arise, this is For‑Each‑Person; if new evils are removed, this is Therapeutic; if one attains awakening to the noble path, this is First Principle.

雙說假、實，是世界。《論》：「輪輻軸輞故有車，五陰和合故有人。」

> Speaking both provisional and real is Worldly. The *Treatise* says: "Because wheels, spokes, axle, and rim [combine], there is a cart; because the five aggregates combine, there is a person."

單說假人即為人。《論》：「或說有人，或說無人。」單說實法即對治。《論》：「對治則有，實性則無。」雙非假實即第一義。《論》：「言語道斷，心行亦訖。」(云云)。

> Speaking only the provisional person is For‑Each‑Person. The *Treatise* says: "Sometimes it says there is a person; sometimes it says there is no person." Speaking only real dharmas is Therapeutic. The *Treatise* says: "Therapeutic then exists; real nature is then absent." Neither provisional nor real is First Principle. The *Treatise* says: "The path of words is cut off; the activities of mind also cease" (and so on).

因緣和合，有善人、惡人之異，是世界；善緣和合有善人，是為人；惡緣和合有惡人，是對治；雙非善惡，是第一義。

> When causes and conditions combine, there are differences of good and evil persons—this is Worldly. When good conditions combine and there is a good person—this is For‑Each‑Person. When evil conditions combine and there is an evil person—this is Therapeutic. Neither good nor evil is First Principle.

五陰實法隔歷，是世界；從善五陰生善五陰，是為人；以善五陰破惡五陰，是對治；無漏五陰，是第一義。

> The real dharmas of the five aggregates, distinguished in sequence, are Worldly. From good five aggregates giving rise to good five aggregates is For‑Each‑Person. Using good five aggregates to break evil five aggregates is Therapeutic. Outflow‑free five aggregates are First Principle.

善法惡法異，是世界；說今善法生後善法，是為人；以今善法破今惡法，是對治；非善非惡，是第一義。

> Good dharmas and evil dharmas being different is Worldly. Saying that present good dharmas give rise to later good dharmas is For‑Each‑Person. Using present good dharmas to break present evil dharmas is Therapeutic. Neither good nor evil is First Principle.

問曰：人通善惡，何得言生善是為人？

> **Q:** Persons include good and evil—how can “giving rise to good” be For‑Each‑Person?

答：善業為人所乘，令生其善，故言為人。

> **A:** Good karma is what persons ride; it causes their good to arise—therefore it is called For‑Each‑Person.

問：為人生善，秖應生善，那復斷惡？答：為人者，生善是舊、是正，斷惡是傍、是新。治中、治惡是舊、是正，生善是新、是傍(云云)。

> **Q:** If For‑Each‑Person gives rise to good, it should only produce good—how does it also cut off evil? **A:** In For‑Each‑Person, producing good is old and proper; cutting off evil is secondary and new. In Therapeutic, treating the middle and treating evil are old and proper; producing good is new and secondary (and so on).

三世隔別是世界；來世是為人；現世是對治；非三世是第一義。

> The separation of the three times is Worldly; the future time is For‑Each‑Person; the present time is Therapeutic; what is not the three times is First Principle.

四善根內、外凡隔別是世界；煗、頂是為人；總、別念處是對治；世第一法近真是第一義。

> The four good roots, with inner and outer ordinary distinctions, are Worldly; warmth and summit are For‑Each‑Person; the general and specific mindfulness foundations are Therapeutic; the worldly‑supreme dharma approaching truth is First Principle.

見道、脩道異是世界；見道是為人；脩道是對治；無學道是第一義。

> The distinction between the path of seeing and the path of cultivation is Worldly; the path of seeing is For‑Each‑Person; the path of cultivation is Therapeutic; the path of no‑more‑learning is First Principle.

非學、非無學是世界；見學是為人；修學是對治；無學是第一義。

> Neither learning nor no‑more‑learning is Worldly; seeing‑learning is For‑Each‑Person; cultivating‑learning is Therapeutic; no‑more‑learning is First Principle.

世界悉檀中有為人，為人中有對治，對治中有第一義，第一義中無三悉檀(云云)。

> Within the Worldly Siddhānta there is For‑Each‑Person; within For‑Each‑Person there is Therapeutic; within Therapeutic there is First Principle; within First Principle there are no three Siddhāntas (and so on).

一悉檀通有四悉檀，《論》云：「陰入界隔別，是世界；因緣和合故有人，是為人；正世界破邪世界，是對治；聞正世界得悟入，是第一義。」

> One Siddhānta universally contains four Siddhāntas. The *Treatise* says: "The aggregates, bases, and realms are distinguished—this is Worldly; because causes and conditions combine there is a person—this is For‑Each‑Person; correct world breaks wrong world—this is Therapeutic; hearing the correct world and attaining awakening and entry—this is First Principle."

為人有四者：雜業因緣得雜觸、雜受，是世界；於一事中或聽，是為人；或不聽，是對治；無人得觸、無人得受，是第一義。

> For‑Each‑Person has four: mixed karma and conditions yielding mixed contact and mixed feeling is Worldly; in one matter some listen is For‑Each‑Person; some do not listen is Therapeutic; no person attains contact and no person attains feeling is First Principle.

對治中有四者：佛三種法治人心病，藥病異故，是世界；治人是為人；對病是對治；實性則無，是第一義。

> Therapeutic has four: the Buddha’s three kinds of dharma treat people’s mind‑diseases; because medicine and disease differ, this is Worldly; treating people is For‑Each‑Person; treating the disease is Therapeutic; real nature is absent—this is First Principle.

第一義中四者：一切實，乃至四句，是世界；佛、支佛心中所得法豈非理善，是為人；一切語論、一切見、一切著皆可破，一切不能通，第一義能通，是對治；言語道斷，法如涅槃，是第一義。

> First Principle has four: “all real” up to the four phrases is Worldly; the dharmas attained in the minds of Buddhas and pratyekabuddhas are not they good in principle—this is For‑Each‑Person; all speech, all views, all attachments can be broken, all cannot pass through, First Principle can pass through—this is Therapeutic; the path of words is cut off, the dharma is like nirvāṇa—this is First Principle.

又通作者，四悉檀不同，通是世界悉檀也；四悉遍化眾生，通是為人；四悉檀皆破邪，通是對治；隨聞一種皆能悟道，通是第一義也。

> Moreover, in terms of universality: the four Siddhāntas are different, yet their universality is Worldly; the four Siddhāntas universally transform sentient beings, their universality is For‑Each‑Person; the four Siddhāntas all break wrongs, their universality is Therapeutic; following hearing of any one, all can awaken to the path, their universality is First Principle.

別作者，約苦集諦，明世界；約道諦能治，明為人；約道諦所治，明對治；約滅諦，明第一義。

> In terms of specific application: with the truths of suffering and accumulation one clarifies Worldly; with the truth of the path that can treat one clarifies For‑Each‑Person; with the truth of the path that is treated one clarifies Therapeutic; with the truth of cessation one clarifies First Principle.

問：依《論》解相已足，何用多釋？答：《論》云：「四悉檀攝八萬四千法藏」，私約十五法分別，何咎！

> **Q:** If the *Treatise*’s explanation of the marks already suffices, why give many explanations? **A:** The *Treatise* says, "The Four Siddhāntas encompass the eighty‑four thousand Dharma‑collections." I privately distinguish them with fifteen dharmas—what fault is there?

三、釋成者，四悉檀，是龍樹所說；四隨，《禪經》佛所說。今以經成論，於義彌明。所謂隨樂欲、隨便宜、隨對治、隨第一義。樂欲從因得名，世界從果立稱。《釋論》云：「一切善惡，欲為其本。」《淨名》云：「先以欲鉤牽，後令入佛道。」佛經舉脩因之相，論明得果之相。舉隨樂欲，釋成世界悉檀也。隨便宜者，隨行人所宜之法。各各為人者，是化主鑒機，照其可否。《論》云：「於一事中，或聽、或不聽，宜聽、不宜不聽。」如金師子宜數息，浣衣子宜不淨。《經》舉行者之堪宜，《論》明化主之鑒照，以釋成也。餘兩種，經論名義同(云云)。

> Three, explaining the establishment: the Four Siddhāntas are taught by Nāgārjuna; the four “followings” are taught by the Buddha in the *Dhyāna Sūtra*. Now we use the sūtras to complete the treatise and the meaning becomes clearer. Namely, following desire and delight, following convenience, following treatment, following the First Principle. Desire and delight take their name from cause; Worldly takes its designation from fruit. The *Treatise* says: "All good and evil take desire as their root." The *Vimalakīrti* says: "First, hook them with desire; afterward, lead them into the Buddha path." The Buddha‑sūtras raise the marks of cultivating causes; the treatise clarifies the marks of obtaining fruit. Citing “following desire and delight” explains and establishes the Worldly Siddhānta. “Following convenience” follows the dharmas suited to practitioners. “Each‑by‑each for persons” means the guide discerns capacities and illumines whether they are acceptable. The *Treatise* says: "In one matter, some listen, some do not listen; if it is suitable they listen, if it is not suitable they do not listen." For example, a gold‑lion [craftsman] is suited to counting breaths; a laundryman is suited to impurity. The sūtras raise the practitioner’s suitability; the treatise clarifies the guide’s discernment, thereby explaining and establishing. The other two kinds have the same name and meaning in sūtras and treatises (and so on).

四、對諦者，直對一番四諦，如前說。廣對四種四諦者，四種四諦，一一以四悉檀對之。復總對者，生滅四諦對世界，無生四諦對為人，無量四諦對對治，無作四諦對第一義。

> Four, corresponding to the truths: directly correspond to one set of Four Truths, as previously explained. Broadly corresponding to the four kinds of Four Truths: each kind of Four Truths is matched with the Four Siddhāntas. In overall correspondence: the Four Truths of arising‑and‑ceasing correspond to Worldly; the Four Truths of non‑arising correspond to For‑Each‑Person; the immeasurable Four Truths correspond to Therapeutic; the Four Truths of non‑fabrication correspond to First Principle.

[^4]: The **four slanders** (四誹謗): (1) slandering the Buddha, (2) slandering the Dharma, (3) slandering the Saṅgha, (4) slandering those who practice.

[^5]: The **Six Stages of Identity** (六即) are a cardinal Tiantai doctrine, showing how Buddhahood is already present but realized progressively: (1) Identity in Principle—Buddhahood is inherently present; (2) Identity in Name—one has heard the teaching; (3) Identity in Contemplative Practice—one is practicing; (4) Identity in Resemblance—preliminary realization; (5) Identity in Partial Realization—bodhisattva stages; (6) Identity in Ultimate Realization—full Buddhahood.

[^6]: This is the famous *catuṣkoṭi* (tetralemma) of Mādhyamika logic, used by Nāgārjuna: (1) X, (2) not-X, (3) both X and not-X, (4) neither X nor not-X. All four can be skillfully employed to point toward True Reality.
