## ○二、引證
# Section 2: Citing Evidence (引證)

---

### Scriptural Evidence for the Name

如文殊答問偈云「我見燈明佛，本光瑞如此，以是知今佛，欲說《法華經》」。

> As Mañjuśrī replied in verse: "I saw the Buddha Lamp-Bright; the original auspicious light was just like this. From this I know the present Buddha intends to teach the *Lotus Sūtra*."[^1]

何但二萬億？大通智勝及五佛章中三世佛說，皆名「法華」也。

> Not only the two hundred trillion [Buddhas of the Lamp-Bright lineage]—the Great Pervasive Wisdom Excellence Buddha and the Three-World Buddhas in the Five Buddha Chapters—all taught what is named "Lotus."

文云「今佛放光明，助發實相義」，又云「諸法實相義，已為汝等說」，又云「無量眾所尊，為說實相印」。

> The text says: "Now the Buddha emits radiance to assist in revealing the meaning of true reality." And: "The meaning of the true reality of all dharmas has already been taught to you." And: "The one honored by immeasurable beings teaches the Real-Mark Seal."

此亦今古同以實相為體也。

> This also shows that past and present [Buddhas] alike take True Reality as the Substance.

---

### Scriptural Evidence for Essence and Function

文云「佛當雨法雨，充足求道者」，即是會三歸一之法雨，令求佛道因者充足，乃至一切皆會令充足。

> The text says: "The Buddha shall rain the Dharma rain, fulfilling those who seek the Way." This is the Dharma rain that integrates the Three into the One, causing those who seek the Buddha Way as *cause* to be fulfilled, and indeed causing all to be integrated and fulfilled.

若開近顯遠之法雨，令求佛道果者充足。

> If it is the Dharma rain that opens the near to reveal the remote, it causes those who seek the Buddha Way as *fruit* to be fulfilled.

文云「諸求三乘人，若有疑悔者，佛當為除斷，令盡無有餘」，又云「諸佛法久後，要當說真實」，即是斷三乘、五乘、七方便、九法界等疑，皆令生信。

> The text says: "Those seeking the Three Vehicles, if any have doubts or regrets, the Buddha shall eliminate them entirely, leaving nothing remaining." And: "The Dharma of all Buddhas, after a long time, must finally speak the truth." This is the elimination of doubts about the Three Vehicles, Five Vehicles, Seven Expedients, and Nine Dharma-Realms, causing all to give rise to faith.

此證經用也。

> This is evidence for the sūtra's Function.

---

### The "Supernatural Powers" Chapter Evidence

又〈如來神力品〉云「以要言之，如來一切所有之法，如來一切自在神力，如來一切祕要之藏，如來一切甚深之事，皆於此經宣示顯說」。

> The "Supernatural Powers of the Tathāgata" chapter says: "To speak in summary: all the Dharmas of the Tathāgata, all the sovereign supernatural powers of the Tathāgata, all the secret essential treasury of the Tathāgata, all the profound matters of the Tathāgata—all are proclaimed and revealed in this sūtra."[^2]

一切法者，權實一切法皆攝也，此證經名。

> "All Dharmas" means all Dharmas, both Provisional and Real, are included—this is evidence for the sūtra's **Name**.

一切自在神力者，內用名自在，外用名神力，即證用也。

> "All sovereign supernatural powers"—inner functioning is called sovereignty, outer functioning is called supernatural power—this is evidence for the **Function**.

一切祕要之藏者，非器莫授為祕，正體為要，多所含容而無積聚名藏，此證體也。

> "All the secret essential treasury"—not to grant to the unworthy vessel is called secret; the correct Substance is called essential; containing much yet without accumulation is called treasury—this is evidence for the **Substance**.

一切甚深之事者，實相名甚深，為實相修因名深因，究竟實相名深果。

> "All profound matters"—True Reality is called profound; cultivating causes for True Reality is called profound cause; ultimate True Reality is called profound fruit.

---

### The "Dharma Teacher" Chapter Evidence

又〈法師品〉云「若聞此經，乃是善行菩薩之道」，深因也。

> The "Dharma Teacher" chapter says: "If one hears this sūtra, this is the good practice of the bodhisattva path"—the profound cause.

「求佛道者，咸於我前聞《妙法華經》一句，乃至一念隨喜，我皆與授記。乃至須臾聞之，即得究竟三菩提深果。」

> "Those who seek the Buddha Way, who before me have heard even one phrase of the *Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sūtra*, or even given rise to a single thought of rejoicing—I give them all prediction [of Buddhahood]. Even those who hear it for just a moment immediately attain the profound fruit of ultimate *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*."[^3]

此證宗也。

> This is evidence for the **Essence**.

---

### The Six Similes from the "Medicine King" Chapter

又〈藥王品〉舉十譬歎教，今引其六：大如海，高如山，圓如月，照如日，自在如梵王、極如佛。

> The "Medicine King" chapter presents ten similes praising this Teaching. Now we cite six: **Great as the ocean**, **High as the mountain**, **Round as the moon**, **Brilliant as the sun**, **Sovereign as Brahma**, **Ultimate as Buddha**.

---

#### 1. Great as the Ocean (大如海)

海是坎德，萬流歸故，同一鹹故。《法華》亦爾，佛所證得，萬善同歸，同乘佛乘。

> The ocean has the virtue of receiving—all streams return to it; all share the same saltiness. The *Lotus Sūtra* is likewise: what the Buddha has realized, the ten thousand goods return to, all riding the One Buddha Vehicle.

江湖川流，無此大德，餘經亦爾，故《法華》最大也。

> Rivers and lakes do not have this great virtue; other sūtras are the same. Therefore the *Lotus* is the greatest.

---

#### 2. High as the Mountain (高如山)

山王最高，四寶所成故，純諸天居故。《法華》亦爾，在四味教之頂，離四誹謗，開、示、悟、入，純一根一緣，同一道味，純是菩薩，無聲聞弟子故。

> The Mountain King (Mount Sumeru) is highest, formed of four treasures, where only devas dwell. The *Lotus* is likewise: at the summit of the Four Flavor Teachings, free from the four slanders,[^4] opening, revealing, awakening, and entering—purely one root, one condition, one flavor of the Way—purely bodhisattvas, with no śrāvaka disciples.

---

#### 3. Round as the Moon (圓如月)

月能虧盈故，月漸圓故。《法華》亦爾，同體權實故，會漸入頓故。

> The moon can wax and wane; the moon gradually becomes full. The *Lotus* is likewise: the Provisional and Real share one substance; the gradual is integrated into the sudden.

---

#### 4. Brilliant as the Sun (照如日)

燈、炬、星、月與闇共住，譬諸經存二乘道果，與小並立，日能破闇故。

> Lamps, torches, stars, and moon coexist with darkness—this metaphors how other sūtras preserve the Two Vehicle paths and fruits, allowing the small to stand alongside. The sun can destroy darkness.

《法華》破化城，除草庵故。又日映奪星月，令不現故。《法華》拂迹，除方便故。

> The *Lotus* destroys the Conjured City and removes the Grass Hut. The sun outshines stars and moon, making them invisible. The *Lotus* removes the traces and dispenses with skillful means.

---

#### 5. Sovereign as Brahma (自在如梵王)

輪王於四域自在，釋王於三十三天自在，大梵於三界自在。諸經或於俗諦自在，或於真諦自在，或於中道自在；但是歷別自在，非大自在。

> A wheel-turning king is sovereign over the four continents; Śakra is sovereign over the Thirty-Three Heavens; Great Brahma is sovereign over the Three Realms. Other sūtras may be sovereign in conventional truth, or in ultimate truth, or in the Middle Way—but these are all separate sovereignties, not great sovereignty.

今經三諦圓融，最得自在，譬大梵王。

> This present sūtra's Three Truths are perfectly interfused, achieving the greatest sovereignty—metaphorically, the Great Brahma King.

---

#### 6. Ultimate as Buddha (極如佛)

餘經拔眾生出生死，如五佛子，於凡夫第一。或拔眾生出涅槃，如菩薩居無學上。今經拔出眾生，過方便教菩薩上，即成法王，最為第一。

> Other sūtras deliver beings from birth-and-death, like the Five Buddha Sons, who are first among ordinary beings. Or they deliver beings from nirvāṇa, like bodhisattvas who dwell above the non-learners. This present sūtra delivers beings beyond the bodhisattvas of the expedient teachings, immediately becoming Dharma Kings—the ultimate first.

---

## ○三、生起
# Section 3: Demonstrating the Arising (生起)

---

能生為生，所生為起。前後有次第，麁細不相違。

> "That which generates" is called *arising*; "that which is generated" is called *starting*. There is a sequence from before to after; coarse and subtle do not conflict.

肇云：「名無召物之功，物無應名之實。無名無物，名、物安在？」蓋第一義中無相意耳。

> [Sēng]zhào said: "Names have no power to summon things; things have no reality to respond to names. If there are no names and no things, where are names and things?" This is the meaning of no-marks in the first principle.

世諦為言，無名無以顯法，故初釋名。名，名於法，法即是體，尋名識體；體非宗不會，會體自行已圓，從體起用，導利含識；利益既多，須分別教相也。

> Speaking in terms of conventional truth: without names, there is no way to reveal the Dharma—hence we first interpret the Name. Names designate the Dharma; the Dharma is the Substance. Following names, we recognize the Substance. The Substance cannot be integrated without the Essence. Integrating the Substance, self-practice is already complete. From the Substance arises Function, guiding and benefiting sentient beings. Since the benefits are many, we must distinguish the Teaching Classification.

---

### The Arising According to "Open, Reveal, Awaken, Enter"

開、示、悟、入，亦約行次第，法本無開閉，今呼為方便門開，此聞名也。示真實相，體也。自迷得悟，悟因也。由因故悟果，宗也。悟故深入，亦令他入，用也。分別同異，教也。

> "Open, reveal, awaken, enter"—this also follows the sequence of practice. The Dharma originally has neither opening nor closing; now we call it "opening the gate of skillful means"—this is hearing the **Name**. "Revealing the marks of true reality"—the **Substance**. "Being confused yet attaining awakening"—awakening to the **cause**. "Due to cause, awakening to fruit"—the **Essence**. "Awakening, one deeply enters and causes others to enter"—the **Function**. "Distinguishing sameness and difference"—the **Teaching**.

今之五義，依〈序品〉扶行次第也。

> These five meanings follow the sequence of practice supported by the "Introduction" chapter.

---

## ○四、開合
# Section 4: Opening and Combining (開合)

---

五章共釋一經，種種分別，令易解故。凡三種開合，謂五種、十種、譬喻。

> The Five Chapters together interpret one sūtra. Various distinctions are made for ease of understanding. There are three kinds of opening and combining: the five kinds, the ten kinds, and simile.

---

### The Five-Kind Opening

初、釋名通論事、理，顯體專論理，宗、用但論事，教相分別事、理。

> First: Interpreting the Name discusses both phenomena and principle. Discerning the Substance discusses only principle. Essence and Function discuss only phenomena. Teaching Classification distinguishes phenomena and principle.

釋名通說教行，顯體非教、非行，宗、用但行，教相但教。

> Interpreting the Name discusses both teaching and practice. Discerning the Substance is neither teaching nor practice. Essence and Function are only practice. Teaching Classification is only teaching.

釋名通說因果，顯體非因、非果，宗自因果，用教他因果，教相分別上法耳。

> Interpreting the Name discusses both cause and effect. Discerning the Substance is neither cause nor effect. Essence is self-practice cause-and-effect. Function teaches others cause-and-effect. Teaching Classification distinguishes the above dharmas.

---

### The Simile: The Human Body

譬喻者，譬如總名人身，開身則有識、命、煖，分別諸身貴、賤、賢、愚，種種差降。人身譬名，識以譬體，命以譬宗，煖以譬用，分別譬教相(云云)。

> **Simile**: It is like the general designation "human body." Opening the body, there are consciousness, life, and warmth; distinguishing various bodies—noble or base, wise or foolish—there are various gradations. The **human body** metaphors the **Name**. **Consciousness** metaphors the **Substance**. **Life** metaphors the **Essence**. **Warmth** metaphors the **Function**. **Distinguishing** metaphors the **Teaching Classification**.

---

## ○五、料簡
# Section 5: Critical Discrimination (料簡)

---

This section presents a series of questions and answers addressing potential objections.

### Q1: Doesn't "flower for the lotus" imply cause contains effect?

問：若為蓮故華，華果必俱，將不墮因中有果耶？

> **Q:** If "the flower exists for the sake of the lotus" and flower and fruit necessarily coexist, doesn't this fall into [the Sāṃkhya heresy of] "effect within cause"?

答：因中有果，舊醫邪法，已為初教所破，尚非麁權實義，況是妙因妙果、新醫真乳法邪？

> **A:** "Effect within cause" is the old physician's heretical doctrine, already refuted by the initial teaching. It is not even the coarse meaning of Provisional and Real—how much less the wonderful cause and wonderful fruit of the new physician's true milk Dharma!

---

### Q2: If the flower metaphors the Provisional, why destroy the Grass Hut?

問：華以喻權，權是小乘之法，則不應破於草庵。草庵既破，何得以華喻權？

> **Q:** If the flower metaphors the Provisional, and the Provisional is the Small Vehicle dharma, then it should not destroy the Grass Hut. Since the Grass Hut is destroyed, how can the flower metaphor the Provisional?

答：小乘是化他之權，是故須破。今明自行之權，故以華喻耳。

> **A:** The Small Vehicle is the **expedient for transforming others**—therefore it must be destroyed. Now we clarify the **expedient of self-practice**—hence the flower is used as metaphor.

---

### Q3: Why five chapters, not four or six?

問：何故五章，不四不六？

> **Q:** Why five chapters, not four or six?

答：設作四六，亦復生疑，墮無窮問，非也。

> **A:** If we made it four or six, doubt would likewise arise, falling into infinite questioning. This is not [the point].

---

## ○六、觀心
# Section 6: Observing the Mind (觀心)

---

This is the practical core of the Seven Interpretations—transforming doctrine into meditation.

### The Mind and the Title

心如幻焰，但有名字，名之為心。適言其有，不見色質；適言其無，復起慮想。不可以有、無思度故，故名心為「妙」。

> The mind is like a magical flame—it merely has a name; it is called "mind." Just when you say it exists, you don't see its form or substance. Just when you say it doesn't exist, thoughts arise again. Because it cannot be measured by existence or non-existence, the mind is called **"Wonderful"** (妙).

妙心可軌，稱之為「法」。

> The wonderful mind can be a guiding standard—it is called **"Dharma"** (法).

心法非因、非果，能如理觀，即辦因果，是名「蓮華」。

> The dharma of mind is neither cause nor effect; yet when contemplated in accord with principle, it accomplishes cause and effect—this is called **"Lotus Flower"** (蓮華).

由一心成觀，亦轉教餘心，名之為「經」。

> Through one mind, contemplation is accomplished, and it transforms to teach other minds—this is called **"Sūtra"** (經).

釋名竟。

> This completes the interpretation of the Name.

---

### The Mind as Substance, Essence, Function

心本無名，亦無無名。心名不生，亦復不滅，心即實相。

> The mind originally has no name, nor is it "no-name." The name of mind is not arising, nor is it ceasing. **The mind is True Reality.**

初觀為因，觀成為果。

> Initial contemplation is **cause**; accomplished contemplation is **fruit**.

以觀心故，惡覺不起。心數塵勞，若同若異，皆被化而轉，是為觀心。

> Because of contemplating the mind, evil thoughts do not arise. The mental factors and afflictions, whether same or different, are all transformed—this is contemplating the mind.

---

### The Six Stages of Identity (六即)

若欲免貧窮，當勤三觀；欲免上慢，當聞六即。

> If you wish to escape poverty, you must diligently [practice] the Three Contemplations. If you wish to escape arrogance, you must hear [of] the Six Stages of Identity.[^5]

世間相常住，理即也。

> "The worldly marks are eternally abiding"—this is **Identity in Principle** (理即).

於諸過去佛，若有聞一句，名字即也。

> "If regarding all past Buddhas, one has heard even a single phrase"—this is **Identity in Name** (名字即).

深信隨喜，觀行即也。

> "Deep faith and rejoicing"—this is **Identity in Contemplative Practice** (觀行即).

六根清淨，相似即也。

> "Six sense faculties purified"—this is **Identity in Resemblance** (相似即).

安住實智中，分證即也。

> "Abiding in real wisdom"—this is **Identity in Partial Realization** (分證即).

唯佛與佛究盡實相，究竟即也。

> "Only a Buddha and a Buddha can fathom the reality of all dharmas"—this is **Identity in Ultimate Realization** (究竟即).

---

### The Balance of Study and Practice

《華嚴》云「譬如貧窮人，日夜數他寶，自無半錢分」，偏聞之失也。

> The *Avataṃsaka* says: "Like a poor person who day and night counts others' treasures yet has not half a coin"—this is the fault of **one-sided study**.

下文云「未得謂得，未證謂證」，偏觀之失也。

> The text below says: "Claiming attainment without attainment, claiming realization without realization"—this is the fault of **one-sided meditation**.

若欲免貧窮，當勤三觀；欲免上慢，當聞六即。

> If you wish to escape poverty, diligently practice the Three Contemplations. If you wish to escape arrogance, learn of the Six Stages.

修心內觀，則有法財；正信外聞，無復上慢。眼慧明聞，具足利益，何得不觀解耶？

> Cultivating inner contemplation of mind, one has Dharma wealth. With correct faith and external hearing, there is no more arrogance. With the eye of wisdom illuminating what is heard, one fully benefits. How could one not contemplate and understand?

---

## ○七、會異
# Section 7: Reconciling Differences (會異)

---

This section harmonizes the Five-Chapter system with the Four Siddhāntas.

### The Four Siddhāntas and the Five Chapters

問：佛有所說，依四悉檀。今解五義，與彼會不？

> **Q:** The Buddha's teaching depends on the Four Siddhāntas. Does our present interpretation of the Five Meanings accord with those?

答：此義今當說，先對五章，次解四悉檀。

> **A:** This meaning shall now be explained. First, we correlate [the Four Siddhāntas] with the Five Chapters; next, we explain the Four Siddhāntas.

世界悉檀對釋名。名該一部，世界亦冠於三。

> **Worldly Siddhānta** corresponds to **Interpreting the Name**. The Name encompasses the entire text; the Worldly likewise crowns the [other] three.

第一義對體，最分明。

> **First-Principle Siddhānta** corresponds to **Substance**—this is most clear.

為人對宗，宗論因果，為人生善，義同。

> **For-Each-Person Siddhānta** corresponds to **Essence**. The Essence discusses cause and effect; "For Each Person" generates good—the meaning is the same.

對治對用，用破疑滯，與治病事齊。

> **Therapeutic Siddhānta** corresponds to **Function**. Function breaks through doubt and stagnation; treating illness is its equivalent.

分別悉檀對教相，教相如後說。

> **Distinguishing Siddhānta** corresponds to **Teaching Classification**, as explained later.

---

### What Are the Four Siddhāntas?

南岳師，例「大涅槃」，梵、漢兼稱。「悉」是此言，「檀」是梵語，悉之言遍，檀翻為施。佛以四法，遍施眾生，故言悉檀也。

> Master Nanyue, following the example of "*Mahāparinirvāṇa*," used both Sanskrit and Chinese together. "Xī" (悉) is Chinese [meaning "universal"]; "tán" (檀) is Sanskrit [*dāna*, meaning "giving"]. "Xī" means "universally"; "tán" translates as "giving." The Buddha universally gives four dharmas to sentient beings—hence the term *siddhānta* (悉檀).

---

#### 1. Worldly Siddhānta (世界悉檀)

世界如車，輪、輻、軸、輞和合故有車，無別車也。五眾和合故有人，無別人也。

> The world is like a cart: wheels, spokes, axle, and rim combine to give rise to "cart"—there is no separate cart. The five aggregates combine to give rise to "person"—there is no separate person.

有於五陰、十二入、十八界，一切名相隔別，名為世界。

> The existence of the five aggregates, twelve bases, and eighteen realms, with all their names and marks separately distinguished—this is called "world."

大聖隨順眾生所欲樂聞，分別為說正因緣世界法，令得世間正見，是名世界悉檀相。

> The Great Sage, following what sentient beings delight to hear, distinctly teaches the Dharma of correct causation and world—enabling them to gain correct worldly views. This is the mark of the Worldly Siddhānta.

---

#### 2. For-Each-Person Siddhānta (為人悉檀)

大聖觀人心而為說法，人心各各不同，於一事中或聽或不聽。

> The Great Sage observes people's minds and teaches accordingly. People's minds differ; regarding one matter, some listen and some do not.

此意傍為破執，正是生信。增長善根，施其善法也。故名各各為人悉檀。

> The secondary purpose is to break attachments; the primary purpose is to generate faith, increase good roots, and bestow wholesome dharmas. Hence it is called the "For Each Person" Siddhānta.

---

#### 3. Therapeutic Siddhānta (對治悉檀)

有法對治則有、實性則無。對治者：貪欲多，教觀不淨；瞋恚多，教修慈心；愚癡多，教觀因緣。

> There are dharmas that exist as treatment but have no inherent nature. Treatment means: for excessive greed, teach contemplation of impurity; for excessive anger, teach cultivation of loving-kindness; for excessive delusion, teach contemplation of causation.

對治惡病，說此法藥，遍施眾生，故名對治悉檀相也。

> Treating evil diseases, teaching this Dharma medicine, universally giving to sentient beings—this is the mark of the Therapeutic Siddhānta.

---

#### 4. First-Principle Siddhānta (第一義悉檀)

有二種：一、不可說；二、可說。

> There are two kinds: (1) the inexpressible; (2) the expressible.

不可說者，即是諸佛、辟支佛、羅漢所得真實法。引偈云：「言論盡竟，心行亦訖，不生不滅，法如涅槃。」

> The inexpressible is what all Buddhas, pratyekabuddhas, and arhats realize as true reality. A verse says: "Speech and discourse come to an end; mental activity also ceases. Neither arising nor ceasing—the Dharma is like nirvāṇa."

說諸行處，名世界；說不行處，名第一義。

> Teaching where activities proceed is called "world." Teaching where [activities] do not proceed is called "First Principle."

約可說者，一切實、一切不實、一切亦實亦不實、一切非實非不實，皆名諸法之實相。

> Regarding the expressible: "All is real," "All is unreal," "All is both real and unreal," "All is neither real nor unreal"—these are all names for the True Mark of all dharmas.[^6]

故《中論》云：「為向道人說四句，如快馬見鞭影即入正路。」

> Therefore the *Madhyamaka-śāstra* says: "For one who is heading toward the Way, explain the four phrases; like a swift horse seeing the shadow of the whip, they immediately enter the correct path."

若聞四句，心生取著，皆是戲論，豈第一義耶？

> But if upon hearing the four phrases, the mind gives rise to grasping—this is all idle talk. How is this the First Principle?

---
