○第十、功德利益者，秖功德利益，一而無異；若分別者，自益名功德，益他名利益(云云)。此為四：一、利益來意。二、正說中利益。三、流通中利益。四、觀心中利益。
> Tenth, the Subtlety of Merit and Benefit: merit and benefit are one and not different; if distinguished, self-benefit is called merit, benefiting others is called benefit (and so on). This has four: (1) the coming intent of benefit; (2) benefit within the main exposition; (3) benefit within the circulation; (4) benefit within contemplation of mind.

一、利益來意者，諸佛所為，未甞空過。《釋論》云：「佛入王三昧，前放光度前者，後放光度後者。」譬如網魚，前獲、後獲，見光聞法，皆不唐捐。《淨名》云：「法寶普照而雨甘露。」即身口兩益也。《華嚴》、《思益》並云：放光破慳、破瞋、破癡等。具如彼說。今經四大弟子，領佛開三顯一之益。佛言：如來復有無量功德，汝等說不能盡。譬如大雲起於世間，譬形益也。興雷耀電，譬神通益也。其雨普等，譬說法益也。而諸草木各得生長，即是四種眷屬，皆沾七益。故次明利益妙也。
> First, the coming intent of benefit: what Buddhas do never passes in vain. The Sastra says: "The Buddha enters the King Samadhi; the light released before liberates those before, the light released after liberates those after." It is like netting fish: those caught before and after, seeing the light and hearing the dharma, are not wasted. The Vimalakirti says: "The dharma-treasure universally shines and rains sweet dew." This is benefit of body and mouth. The Avatamsaka and the Siyi both say: releasing light breaks stinginess, breaks anger, breaks delusion, and so on. It is fully as those say. In this sutra the four great disciples receive the Buddha's benefit of opening the three and revealing the one. The Buddha says: the Tathagata again has immeasurable merit; you cannot finish speaking it. It is like a great cloud arising in the world: a metaphor for form-benefit. Raising thunder and flashing lightning is a metaphor for supernatural-power benefit. Its rain is universally equal: a metaphor for dharma-exposition benefit. And all grasses and trees each obtain growth, which is the four kinds of retinue; all are moistened by the seven benefits. Therefore next he clarifies the Subtlety of Benefit.

二、正說利益，又為三：先、論遠益。次、論近益。三、論當文益。
> Second, benefit in the main exposition is again three: first, discuss distant benefit; next, discuss near benefit; third, discuss benefit in the present text.

遠益者，即大通佛所十六王子，助化宣揚，雙擊毒天二鼓。善生有淺深，惑死有奢促。始人天善，終至大樹，淺益也。始初心最實，終後心最實，深益也。始破不善，終破塵沙，奢死也。始破無明，終亦破無明，促死也。死之奢、促，是毒鼓之力；善生淺、深，天鼓之力。故文云：破有法王，出現於世，隨眾生欲，而為說法。即二鼓之文義也。破有義如前說。
> Distant benefit is the sixteen princes of the Great-Universal Buddha, assisting transformation and proclaiming, double-striking the two drums of poison and heaven. Good rebirth has shallow and deep; delusion-death has long and short. Beginning with human-and-heaven good and ending at the great tree is shallow benefit. Beginning with the first mind as most real and ending with the later mind as most real is deep benefit. Beginning by breaking unwholesome and ending by breaking dust-and-sand is long death. Beginning by breaking ignorance and ending also by breaking ignorance is short death. The long and short of death are the power of the poison drum; the shallow and deep of good rebirth are the power of the heaven drum. Therefore the text says: the Dharma King who breaks existence appears in the world and, following sentient beings' desires, speaks dharma. This is the textual meaning of the two drums. The meaning of breaking existence is as explained before.

說法益義，今當說，略為七益：一、二十五有果報益，亦名地上清涼益。二、二十五有因華開敷益，亦名小草益。三、真諦三昧析法益，亦名中草益。四、俗諦三昧五通益，亦名上草益。五、真諦三昧體法益，亦名小樹益。六、俗諦三昧六通益，亦名大樹益。七、中道王三昧益，亦名最實事益。若二十五有因果益，堪為業生眷屬。若真諦三昧體析益，堪為願生眷屬。若俗諦三昧五通六通益，堪為神通眷屬。若中道王三昧益，堪為應生眷屬。私謂應有四雙、八益，直是開前、合後，故言七益。若開後合前，亦是七益；前後俱開，即是八益，所謂中道次第益，中道不次第益。若前後俱合，則是六益(云云)。
> Regarding the meaning of the benefit of speaking dharma, now we should speak it, briefly as seven benefits: (1) twenty-five existences fruit-reward benefit, also called ground clear-cool benefit; (2) twenty-five existences cause flower opening benefit, also called small grass benefit; (3) true-truth samadhi analytical-dharma benefit, also called middle grass benefit; (4) conventional-truth samadhi five powers benefit, also called upper grass benefit; (5) true-truth samadhi body-dharma benefit, also called small tree benefit; (6) conventional-truth samadhi six powers benefit, also called great tree benefit; (7) middle-way king samadhi benefit, also called most-real-matter benefit. If the twenty-five existences cause-and-effect benefit, it fits as karma-born retinue. If the true-truth samadhi body-analytic benefit, it fits as vow-born retinue. If the conventional-truth samadhi five- and six-powers benefit, it fits as supernatural-born retinue. If the middle-way king samadhi benefit, it fits as response-born retinue. I privately say there should be four pairs and eight benefits; it is simply opening the front and closing the back, therefore called seven benefits. If one opens the back and closes the front, it is also seven benefits; if both front and back are opened, it is eight benefits, namely middle-way sequential benefit and middle-way non-sequential benefit. If both front and back are closed, then it is six benefits (and so on).

已略說七益竟，今更廣開為十益：一、果益。二、因益。三、聲聞益。四、緣覺益。五、六度益。六、通益。七、別益。八、圓益。九、變易益。十、實報益。
> Having already briefly explained seven benefits, now further broadly open into ten benefits: (1) fruit benefit; (2) cause benefit; (3) sravaka benefit; (4) pratyekabuddha benefit; (5) six-perfections benefit; (6) common benefit; (7) distinct benefit; (8) perfect benefit; (9) transformation benefit; (10) real-reward benefit.

果益者，即二十五有果報益也。有八大地獄：謂阿鼻、想、黑繩、眾合、叫喚、大叫喚、焦熱、大焦熱。一一各有十六小獄為眷屬，合一百三十六所。此正地獄，在地下二萬由旬。其傍地獄，或在地上、或在鐵圍山間。傍輕正重，重者遍歷百三十六，中者不遍，下者復減。其中眾生，常為熱苦所逼，不可具說，聞者驚怖。《四解脫經》稱為火塗，初入初出，兩時可化。其中罪人，宿世善根，可發關宜。而為聖人赴對應之，或蒙光照、或注雨滅火、或調達婆藪開示說法，熱悶甦醒，身體清涼，獲冥、顯兩益，諸苦得息。八寒氷，謂阿波波等，亦有百三十六所，乃至得冥、顯兩益，溫煖適身，是為地獄果上得清涼益也。
> Fruit benefit is the fruit-reward benefit of the twenty-five existences. There are eight great hells: namely Avici, Thought, Black Rope, Crowd-Confluence, Wailing, Great Wailing, Scorching Heat, and Great Scorching Heat. Each has sixteen small hells as retinue, totaling one hundred thirty-six places. This main hell is twenty thousand yojanas beneath the ground. Its adjacent hells are either on the ground or between the iron encircling mountains. The adjacent are light and the main are heavy: the heavy ones traverse all one hundred thirty-six, the middle do not traverse them all, the lower reduce further. The beings therein are always pressed by hot suffering and cannot be fully described; those who hear are frightened. The Sutra of the Four Liberations calls it the Fire Mire; at first entry and first exit, at those two times one can be transformed. The sinners therein have good roots from past lives that can be triggered; sages go and respond to them: perhaps they receive light illumination, perhaps rain is poured to extinguish fire, perhaps Devadatta and Vasistha explain and teach dharma; heat and oppression revive, the body becomes cool, gaining hidden and manifest benefits, and all suffering ceases. The eight cold ices, called Apopo and the like, also have one hundred thirty-six places; up through gaining hidden and manifest benefits, warmth and heat fit the body. This is the cool benefit obtained atop the fruits of hell.

畜生者，略有三種：水、陸、空。陸有三品：重者土內，不見光明；中者，山林；輕者，人所畜養。彊者伏弱，飲血噉肉，怖畏百端。《四解脫經》稱為血塗。其中眾生，先世善根，可發關宜。聖人赴對應之，得無所畏，獲冥、顯兩益，是為畜生果上清涼益也。
> As to animals, there are roughly three kinds: water, land, and air. Land has three grades: the heavy are within the earth, not seeing light; the middle are in mountains and forests; the light are those kept by people. The strong subdue the weak, drink blood and eat meat, with a hundred fears. The Sutra of the Four Liberations calls it the Blood Mire. The beings therein have good roots from past lives that can be triggered; sages go and respond to them, they obtain fearlessness and gain hidden and manifest benefits; this is the cool benefit atop the fruits of animals.

餓鬼者，或居海渚、或在人間山林中、或似人形、或似獸形。重者飢火節焰，不聞漿水之名；中者伺求蕩滌，膿血糞穢；輕者時薄一飽，加以刀杖驅逼，塞海填河。《四解脫》稱為刀塗。其中眾生，先世善根，可發關宜。聖人赴對應之，手出香乳，施令飽滿，獲冥、顯兩益，是為餓鬼果上清涼益也。
> Hungry ghosts live either on sea islets, or in human mountains and forests, or resemble human form, or resemble animal form. The heavy have hunger-fire joint flames and do not hear even the name of broth and water; the middle seek washing, pus, blood, feces, and filth; the light sometimes get a thin single meal, and are driven and forced by knives and staffs, blocking seas and filling rivers. The Sutra of the Four Liberations calls it the Knife Mire. The beings therein have good roots from past lives that can be triggered; sages go and respond to them, from the hand comes fragrant milk, giving and filling them to satisfaction, gaining hidden and manifest benefits; this is the cool benefit atop the fruits of hungry ghosts.

阿脩羅者，或居半須彌巖窟、或大海邊、或大海底。與諸天為憾，恒懷怖畏，雷鳴謂為天鼓，龍雨變成刀劍。此中眾生，先世善根，可發關宜。聖人赴對應之，軟言調伏，獲冥、顯兩益，是為阿脩羅果上清涼益也。
> Asuras live either in caves on half of Mount Sumeru, or by the great sea, or at the bottom of the great sea. They harbor resentment toward the gods and constantly hold fear; they call thunder the heaven drum, and dragon rain becomes knives and swords. The beings herein have good roots from past lives that can be triggered; sages go and respond to them, subduing them with gentle words, gaining hidden and manifest benefits; this is the cool benefit atop the fruits of asuras.

四天下人雖果報勝劣，俱有生、老、病、死，同是輕報泥犁。其中眾生，先世善根，可發關宜。聖人赴對應之，令所離得離，所求得求，獲冥、顯兩益也。
> Though the people of the four continents have superior and inferior retribution, all have birth, aging, sickness, and death, the same as the light-retribution niraya. The beings therein have good roots from past lives that can be triggered; sages go and respond to them, enabling what they leave to be left and what they seek to be obtained, gaining hidden and manifest benefits.

六欲天者，地天別有脩羅鬪戰之難，通有五衰死相苦等地獄。其中諸天，先世善根，可發關宜。聖人赴對應之，令獲冥、顯兩益也。
> As to the six desire heavens, the ground heavens separately have the hardship of asura battles; in general they have the suffering of the five decays and death signs and the like, like hell. The gods therein have good roots from past lives that can be triggered; sages go and respond to them, enabling them to obtain hidden and manifest benefits.

四禪、梵王、無想、那含等色天，雖無下界諸苦，而為色所籠。若命盡時，不樂入禪，風觸吹身，唯除眼識，餘皆有苦。其中諸天，先世善根，可發關宜。聖人赴對應之，令獲冥、顯兩益也。
> The form heavens of the four dhyanas, Brahma King, non-thought, anagamin, and the like, though without the various sufferings of the lower realms, are enclosed by form. When life ends, if they do not delight to enter dhyana, wind-contact blows the body; only eye-consciousness is excluded, the rest all have suffering. The gods therein have good roots from past lives that can be triggered; sages go and respond to them, enabling them to obtain hidden and manifest benefits.

四空諸天，雖無欲色界等苦，如瘡、如癰、如癡、如箭入體，成就細煩惱。其中諸天，先世善根，可發關宜。聖人赴對應之，令獲冥顯兩益。
> The various gods of the four formless [heavens], though without the sufferings of the desire and form realms, are like sores, like abscesses, like delusion, like an arrow entering the body, accomplishing subtle afflictions. The gods therein have good roots from past lives that can be triggered; sages go and respond to them, enabling them to obtain hidden and manifest benefits.

此清涼益，合而言之，蓋由凡聖慈善根力；別而言之，本由菩薩初觀二十五有所防之惡而起於悲，觀二十五能防之善而起於慈，以此慈悲熏王三昧，不捨眾生，赴對關宜，令得利益。
> This cool benefit, speaking together, is due to the compassionate good-root power of ordinary and sage; speaking separately, it is originally because bodhisattvas first observe the evils to be prevented in the twenty-five existences and arouse compassion, and observe the wholesome dharmas that can prevent those evils and arouse kindness; with this compassion and kindness they perfume the king samadhi, do not abandon beings, go and respond to what is triggered and suitable, and cause them to gain benefit.

《大經》明二十五三昧破二十五有者，十番之一，意略如此也。
> The Great Sutra clarifies that the twenty-five samadhis break the twenty-five existences; this is the first of the ten applications; its meaning is roughly like this.

二番二十五有修因益者，夫自、他因果，各隨義便，互舉一邊，說之則易。前果報益，處所、時節不同，不得一身備論諸益，從多人多處易顯。若明因益，一人之心起無量業，其義易顯。故約一人明二十五有因益也。云何因益？四因壞益，二十一因成益；或一因壞益，一因成益，二十三亦成亦壞益。
> Second, the benefit of cultivating causes in the twenty-five existences: as for self and other causes and results, each follows meaning and convenience, raising one side; spoken thus it is easy. The previous fruit-reward benefit has different places and times and cannot in one body fully discuss all benefits, so it is easier to manifest by many people in many places. If clarifying cause benefit, one person's mind gives rise to immeasurable karma, and its meaning is easy to show. Therefore, concerning one person, we clarify the cause benefit of the twenty-five existences. What is cause benefit? Four causes are broken benefit; twenty-one causes are completed benefit; or one cause broken benefit and one cause completed benefit; twenty-three are both completed and broken benefit.

若無戒自制，縱其身口，作四趣業，名地獄人。若捨惡持戒，名見天人。但禁戒嚴峻，遇緣動退，則惡業還興。或四重五逆，焚毀塔寺，此心生時，惡起戒沒，是業熟成，必墮惡道。欲離此心，成就戒、善，此有可發關宜之機，感無垢三昧赴對應之。惡心豁破，地獄因息，得冥顯兩益(云云)。今人雖入道場懺悔，惡心不轉，則惡業不壞。惡業不壞，得繩不斷，罪不得滅也。
> If without precepts to restrain oneself, one indulges body and mouth and makes the karma of the four destinies, one is called a hell person. If one abandons evil and holds precepts, one is called a heaven-seeing person. But if precepts are strictly restrained and one meets conditions and retreats, then evil karma arises again. Or, with the four grave [offenses] and five rebellions, burning and destroying stupas and temples, when this mind arises, evil arises and precepts sink; this karma ripens and one must fall into the evil paths. Wanting to depart from this mind and accomplish precepts and good, there is a stimulus that can be triggered and suitable, moving the undefiled samadhi to go and respond. The evil mind is broken open, the hell cause ceases, and one gains hidden and manifest benefits (and so on). Though people now enter the practice hall and repent, if the evil mind does not turn, then evil karma does not break. If evil karma does not break, the obtaining of the rope does not sever, and guilt cannot be extinguished.

若慳貪[A4]諂媚，邀射名聞，內無實德，欲人稱美；此惡起戒伏，墮於鬼中。若無慚愧，負債不還，無恭敬心，憍慢瞋忿，貪婪饕餮；此惡起戒伏，墮畜生道。若嫉賢妬能，為勝他故而修福力，蛆毒惡心，方便墜陷，驚怖於他；是惡起戒伏，墮阿脩羅業。欲離此三惡心，成就戒善，善有可發關宜之機，聖用赴對應之。惡心豁破，戒善完具，此名四趣因壞、人天因成，獲冥顯兩益。此約人道修因，作此釋耳。
> If greedy and grasping [A4] and flattering, seeking fame and reputation, inwardly without real virtue and wanting people to praise; this evil arises, precepts are subdued, and one falls among ghosts. If without shame, owing debts and not repaying, with no mind of respect, arrogant and angry, greedy and gluttonous; this evil arises, precepts are subdued, and one falls into the animal path. If jealous of the worthy and envious of the able, cultivating merit for the sake of surpassing others, with a maggot-poison evil mind, skillfully falling and sinking, frightening others; this evil arises, precepts are subdued, and one falls into asura karma. Wanting to depart from these three evil minds and accomplish precept-good, good has a stimulus that can be triggered and suitable, and sages use it to go and respond. The evil mind is broken open, precept-good is fully equipped; this is named the breaking of the four destinies' causes and the completion of human-and-heaven causes, gaining hidden and manifest benefits. This is only an explanation by cultivating causes in the human path.

    [A4] 諂【CB】，謟【大】(cf. L116n1490_p0520b03)
> [A4] Chan [CB], Tan [Da] (cf. L116n1490_p0520b03).

若約諸趣，欲出地獄入畜，欲出畜入鬼，欲出鬼入脩羅，欲出脩羅入人道，皆傳傳有因。因成業轉，此例可知(云云)。
> If regarding the various destinies, wishing to exit hell and enter animals, wishing to exit animals and enter ghosts, wishing to exit ghosts and enter asuras, wishing to exit asuras and enter the human path, all are transmitted and transmitted with causes. Causes complete and karma turns; this pattern can be known (and so on).

若堅持五戒，兼行仁義，孝順父母，信敬慚愧，即是人業。人業有四品：上、中、下、下下。若就果報，閻浮提為下下。若就入道，欝單越為下下。或時善心歇末，惡念唯強，善有可成，惡有可滅，關宜之機，聖用赴對應之。四惡趣壞，四品善成，獲冥顯兩益(云云)。
> If one firmly holds the five precepts and also practices humaneness and righteousness, is filial and obedient to parents, and has faith, respect, and shame, this is human karma. Human karma has four grades: upper, middle, lower, and lowest. If in terms of retribution, Jambudvipa is lowest. If in terms of entering the Way, Uttarakuru is lowest. Sometimes good mind rests and evil thoughts are strong; good can be completed and evil can be extinguished: the stimulus of what is suitable, sages use to go and respond. The four evil destinies are broken, the four grades of good are completed, and one gains hidden and manifest benefits (and so on).

若修持十善，任運無間，善心成熟即天業。故云：純惡心無善念間者，即惡道業，果時純苦故。善惡相間起即人業，人中果報苦樂相間故。十善任運成是天業，天中果報自然故。若修十善兼起護法心，即四天王業。若修十善兼慈化人，是三十三天業。若修十善，其心細妙任運成熟，行住坐臥不惱眾生，善巧純續，是焰摩業。若修十善兼修禪定攝心，麁住細住者，是兜率業；欲界定是化樂業；未到定破事障，是他化業；四禪是色界業；兼於慈悲喜捨，心數法中得定，是梵王業；滅心修無心定，是無想業。
> If one cultivates the ten wholesomes, spontaneously without interruption, when the wholesome mind matures it is heavenly karma. Therefore it is said: a purely evil mind with no interval of wholesome thought is the karma of evil paths, because at fruition it is pure suffering. When wholesome and unwholesome alternate, it is human karma, because in humans the retribution alternates suffering and pleasure. The ten wholesomes maturing spontaneously are heavenly karma, because heavenly retribution is natural. If one cultivates the ten wholesomes and also arouses a mind to protect the dharma, this is the karma of the Four Heavenly Kings. If one cultivates the ten wholesomes and also compassionately transforms people, this is the karma of the Thirty-Three Heavens. If one cultivates the ten wholesomes, with a subtle mind maturing spontaneously, walking, standing, sitting, or lying without troubling beings, with wholesome skill continuing purely, this is the karma of the Yama Heaven. If one cultivates the ten wholesomes and also cultivates dhyana to gather the mind, with coarse abiding and subtle abiding, this is Tusita karma; desire-realm samadhi is the Transformation-Delight karma; the not-yet-arrived samadhi that breaks the obstruction of affairs is the Mastery-of-Others-Transformations karma; the four dhyanas are form-realm karma; combined with kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity, attaining samadhi within mental factors, is Brahma King karma; extinguishing mind to cultivate the no-mind samadhi is non-thought karma.

問：
> Question:

無想是邪見天，云何為機感？
> The Non-Thought is a heterodox-view heaven; how is it a stimulus and response?

答：
> Answer:

《大集》云：菩薩調伏眾生多種，或邪或正，行於非道，通達佛道(云云)。
> The Great Assembly says: bodhisattvas tame beings in many ways, either heterodox or correct, practicing in non-paths, and reach the Buddha-path (and so on).

若舊云：聖人以兩片無漏，夾熏一片有漏，練成無漏。今言：九次第定，熏修有漏成無漏，是那含業。四空定，是無色界業。
> If the old says: sages use two pieces of outflow-free to sandwich and perfume one piece of outflow, refining it into outflow-free. Now it says: the nine successive dhyanas, perfuming and cultivating the outflow to become outflow-free, are the anagamin karma. The four formless samadhis are the formless-realm karma.

如是等二十一有，患自地之苦麁，欲修出要，所求不得，所捨不離；爾時即名，可發關宜之機，感二十一三昧慈悲之力，破其修因，令所離得去，所求得成，拔苦與樂，冥顯兩益。此如經文云：「小草、小根、小莖、小枝、小葉，而得生長。」是此益也。合而言之，蓋由凡聖慈善根力；別而言之，本由菩薩初持二百五十戒，修根本等禪，於一一能防善法之中，皆起慈悲。慈悲本誓，熏王三昧，不捨眾生，赴對關宜，各得利益。《大經》云：「二十五三昧，破二十五有」者，十番之二意，略如此(云云)。
> In this way, for the twenty-one existences, suffering the coarse pains of their own grounds, they wish to cultivate exit but cannot obtain what they seek and cannot leave what they abandon; at that time it is called a stimulus that can be triggered and suitable, moving the compassionate power of the twenty-one samadhis to break their cultivated causes, enabling what they leave to depart and what they seek to be achieved, pulling out suffering and giving joy, with hidden and manifest benefits. As the sutra text says: "small grass, small roots, small stems, small branches, small leaves, and they obtain growth." This is that benefit. Speaking together, it is due to the compassionate good-root power of ordinary and sage; speaking separately, it is originally because bodhisattvas first hold the two hundred fifty precepts, cultivate the root and other dhyanas, and in each of the wholesome dharmas that can prevent [evil], all arouse compassion. The original vow of compassion, perfuming the king samadhi, does not abandon beings, goes and responds to what is triggered and suitable, and each obtains benefit. The Great Sutra says: "the twenty-five samadhis break the twenty-five existences" - this is the second meaning of the ten applications, roughly like this (and so on).

三番、聲聞利益者，若人厭患生死，以死受生，以生歸死，勞累精神，輪轉無際；貪欲自蔽，𤛆牛愛尾，不得解脫。故言若人遭苦，厭老病死，為說涅槃，盡諸苦際；既厭心內決，志求出離，為是事故，修聲聞道。若持戒時，愛見羅剎，毀損浮囊，令戒不淨。戒不淨故，三昧不現前。既無戒定，無漏不發，是故一心修戒定慧，有可發關宜之機，感無垢等四三昧力加之，令四趣業不起，使戒清淨。[A5]若均修定慧，慧若有定，慧不狂；定若有慧，定不愚，名之為賢，賢名隣聖。修此定慧，一心精進如救頭然。願樂禪慧，如渴思飲，而為二十一有漏業之所擾亂，若得諸三昧力加之，定發觀明，四善根成就，伏道純熟，一剎那轉即便發真，成須陀洹，破二十五有見諦煩惱、八十八使。是為二十五三昧通加，令斷見諦惑，而復兼除四思。故云：第十六心即入修道，是其義也。次入修道，若是超人，一時用十三昧力加之，破五下分思惟惑。若鈍人，隨其分分斷思惑，則分分用三昧加之，盡三界惑，究竟真諦三昧益也。此中草利益。合而言之，蓋由凡聖慈善根力；別而言之，由本慈悲，初觀十法界中析空滅色之善，因起弘誓，熏王三昧，不捨眾生，致有中草利益。《大經》明二十五三昧破二十五有者，十番之三，意略如此。
> Third, sravaka benefit: if a person detests birth-and-death, takes birth by death and returns to death by birth, toiling spirit, rotating without end; greed and desire cover them, like the yak that loves its tail, and they cannot be liberated. Therefore it says: if a person encounters suffering and detests aging, sickness, and death, for them one explains nirvana and ends all suffering. Having decided within to detest, they aspire to exit; for this reason they cultivate the sravaka path. If, when holding precepts, love and views are rakshasas that destroy and damage the floating bladder, the precepts are made impure. Because the precepts are impure, samadhi does not manifest before them. Having neither precepts nor samadhi, the outflow-free does not arise; therefore with one mind they cultivate precepts, samadhi, and wisdom, having a stimulus that can be triggered and suitable, moving the power of the four samadhis such as the Undefiled to add to them, causing the karma of the four destinies not to arise and making the precepts pure. [A5] If they evenly cultivate samadhi and wisdom: if wisdom has samadhi, wisdom is not wild; if samadhi has wisdom, samadhi is not foolish; this is called worthy, and worthy is called near-sage. Cultivating this samadhi and wisdom, with one mind they diligently advance as if saving their head. They delight in dhyana and wisdom, like thirst thinking of drink, yet are disturbed by the outflow karma of the twenty-one existences. If they obtain the power of the samadhis to add to them, samadhi arouses contemplative clarity, the four good roots are accomplished, the path of subduing is fully matured, and in a single instant they turn and immediately arouse the true, becoming srotaapanna, breaking the view-truth afflictions of the twenty-five existences and the eighty-eight fetters. This is the twenty-five samadhis commonly added, causing the cutting of view-truth delusions and additionally removing the four thoughts. Therefore it says: at the sixteenth mind they enter the path of cultivation; that is its meaning. Next they enter the path of cultivation: if a superior person, at one time use the power of thirteen samadhis to break the five lower-part thought-delusions; if a dull person, as they sever thought-delusions portion by portion, they use samadhi to add to them portion by portion, exhausting the delusions of the three realms and ultimately attaining true-truth samadhi benefit. This is middle-grass benefit. Speaking together, it is due to the compassionate good-root power of ordinary and sage; speaking separately, it is because of original compassion, first observing the good of analyzing emptiness and extinguishing form within the ten dharma realms, and thereby arousing the great vow, perfuming the king samadhi, not abandoning beings, bringing about middle-grass benefit. The Great Sutra clarifies that the twenty-five samadhis break the twenty-five existences; this is the third meaning of the ten applications, roughly like this.

    [A5] 若【CB】，苦【大】
> [A5] "If" [CB], "bitter" [Da].

四番、緣覺利益者，若人宿善深利，在無佛世厭患生死，樂獨善寂，觀深因緣。文云：「曾供養佛，志求勝法，為說緣覺。」此人大福可發關宜，聖人赴對應之，使其華飛釧動，獲冥顯兩益，悟支佛道。此猶屬中草利益也。
> Fourth, pratyekabuddha benefit: if a person has deep and sharp past good, in a time without a Buddha they detest birth-and-death and delight in solitary quiescence, contemplating deep conditions. The text says: "Having once made offerings to Buddhas, aspiring to superior dharma, he is taught pratyekabuddha." This person has great merit that can be triggered and suitable; sages go and respond to them, causing their flowers to fly and bracelets to move, gaining hidden and manifest benefits, and they awaken to the pratyekabuddha path. This still belongs to middle-grass benefit.

五番、六度菩薩，觀於四諦，行六度行。若行檀時，人從乞頭、索眼、國城、妻子，心或轉動，檀度不成，自知是惡。欲成檀善，可發關宜之機，蒙三昧力，伏其慳蔽，是破餓鬼有。蔽心既去，歡喜布施，如飲甘露。知有為法，危脆無常，是蒙心樂三昧，冥顯之益也。尸羅若成，是伏毀戒蔽，破地獄有，是無垢三昧益也。忍成伏瞋蔽，破畜生有，不退三昧益也。禪成是伏亂蔽，破人有，是四三昧益也。精進成伏懈怠蔽，破脩羅有，歡喜三昧益也。慧成伏愚癡蔽，破天有，十七三昧益也。六蔽是六道業，具出菩薩戒本。以伏六道業故，不為諸蔽所惱，得五神通，遊於六道，成六度行。此即上草益也。通應如前，別而論之，由本觀十法界事中善惡，而起弘誓，熏三三昧，不捨眾生(云云)。
> Fifth, the six-paramita bodhisattvas: they contemplate the four truths and practice the six perfections. If, when practicing dana, people ask for head, seek eyes, country, city, wife, and children, the mind may turn and the dana perfection is not completed, and one knows this is evil. Wanting to accomplish dana good, there is a stimulus that can be triggered and suitable; receiving samadhi power, it subdues the stingy covering - this breaks hungry-ghost existence. When the covering mind is gone, one rejoices in giving, like drinking sweet dew. Knowing conditioned dharmas are dangerous, fragile, and impermanent is benefit from receiving the heart-joy samadhi, hidden and manifest. If sila is accomplished, it subdues the covering that destroys precepts, breaking hell existence; this is the Undefiled samadhi benefit. If patience is accomplished, it subdues the anger-covering, breaking animal existence; this is the non-retreating samadhi benefit. If dhyana is accomplished, it subdues the disorder-covering, breaking human existence; this is the four-samadhi benefit. If vigor is accomplished, it subdues the laziness-covering, breaking asura existence; this is the joy samadhi benefit. If wisdom is accomplished, it subdues the delusion-covering, breaking heaven existence; this is the seventeen-samadhi benefit. The six coverings are the karma of the six paths, fully set out in the bodhisattva precepts text. By subduing the karma of the six paths, one is not vexed by the coverings, obtains five supernatural powers, travels in the six paths, and completes the six-perfections practice. This is the upper-grass benefit. The common response is as before; speaking separately, it is because originally observing good and evil within the ten dharma realms and arousing the great vow, perfuming the three samadhis, not abandoning beings (and so on).

六番、通人益者，此是三乘共學人也。若乾慧地、性地、八人見地，即是用二十五三昧益。從薄地去至十地，用二十一三昧，加破思惑。又侵除無知，是名小樹益也。總別慈悲，例前可知(云云)。
> Sixth, common-person benefit: this is the persons who study in common in the three vehicles. If at the dry-wisdom ground, nature ground, and the eight-person seeing ground, this is using the twenty-five samadhis benefit. From the thin ground up to the ten grounds, they use the twenty-one samadhis, adding to break thought-delusions. Also encroaching to remove ignorance: this is named small-tree benefit. General and specific compassion can be known by analogy to the previous (and so on).

七番、別人益者，此是次第心中繫緣法界，一念法界入十住，得真諦三昧益；入十行、十迴向，得俗諦三昧益；入十地得中諦三昧益。此即大樹之益。總別慈悲，例前(云云)。
> Seventh, distinct-person benefit: this is in sequential mind binding to the dharma realm. One thought of the dharma realm enters the ten abodes and attains true-truth samadhi benefit; entering the ten practices and ten dedications, attains conventional-truth samadhi benefit; entering the ten grounds attains middle-truth samadhi benefit. This is the benefit of the great tree. General and specific compassion are as before (and so on).

八番、圓人益者，此是修三諦一實之理。一念法界，繫緣法界。若歷緣對境，舉足下足無非道場，其心念念與諸波羅蜜相應，修四三昧觀十種境。可發關宜，聖人赴對應之，豁然開悟。或似或真，得冥顯兩益。此是圓用二十五三昧圓加破二十五有，顯出我性，得究竟實事之益也。
> Eighth, perfect-person benefit: this is cultivating the one-real principle of the three truths. One thought of the dharma realm binds to the dharma realm. If passing through conditions and facing objects, raising the foot or lowering the foot is none but the bodhimanda; their mind in each thought accords with the paramitas, cultivating the four samadhis and contemplating the ten kinds of objects. It can trigger what is suitable; sages go and respond and they suddenly awaken. Whether seeming or true, they gain hidden and manifest benefits. This is the perfect use of the twenty-five samadhis, perfectly added to break the twenty-five existences, revealing self-nature, obtaining the benefit of ultimate real matter.

九番、變易益者，此是方便有餘土人益也。前八番中，凡有四處或九處，謂聲聞、緣覺、通教菩薩、別教三十心、圓教似解，止破見思，未除無明，無明潤無漏，受方便生。故下文云：「我於餘國作佛，更有異名，而於彼土求佛智慧，得聞是經，即是彼土入一乘也。」《勝鬘》云：「三人生變易土，謂大力羅漢、辟支佛、菩薩等。」《楞伽》云三種意生身者：一、安樂法意生身，此欲擬二乘人，入涅槃安樂意也。二、三昧意生身，此擬通教出假化物，用神通三昧意也。三、自性意生身，此擬別教修中道自性意也。通言意者，安樂作空意；三昧作假意；自性作中意。別、圓似解，猶未發真，皆名作意。故論云：「是時過意地，住在智業中。」若發真可是智業，未發真猶在意地。是人生彼，析法者鈍；體法者利；別人已習假，又小利；圓人先即中，最利。既有利、鈍之殊，於彼修學，即有次第、不次第兩益。又是次第、不次第，用二十五三昧兩應也。是為九人生方便國，始於彼土，見諸有我性，得最實益。若分別而言，謂方便土在三界外；若即事而真，不必在遠。下文云：「若能深心信解，則為見佛常在耆闍崛山，共大菩薩、聲聞眾僧圍遶說法。」即方便土意也。
> Ninth, transformation benefit: this is the benefit of people in the expedient remainder land. Among the prior eight applications, there are in general four places or nine places: sravakas, pratyekabuddhas, common-teaching bodhisattvas, distinct-teaching thirty minds, perfect-teaching semblance of understanding; they only break views and thought, have not removed ignorance; ignorance moistens the outflow-free and they receive birth in the expedient [land]. Therefore below it says: "In other lands I become Buddha, with another name; and in that land I seek Buddha wisdom. If I obtain hearing this sutra, that is in that land entering the one vehicle." The Srimala says: "Three people are born in the transformation land, namely great-power arhats, pratyekabuddhas, bodhisattvas, and so on." The Lankavatara says there are three kinds of mind-made bodies: (1) the mind-made body of the blissful dharma, which is to analogize the two-vehicle people entering nirvana with a blissful mind. (2) The mind-made body of samadhi, which analogizes common-teaching exiting the provisional to transform beings, using the intent of supernatural samadhi. (3) The mind-made body of self-nature, which analogizes the distinct teaching cultivating the self-nature of the middle way. Generally speaking of mind: bliss makes the empty mind; samadhi makes the provisional mind; self-nature makes the middle mind. Distinct and Perfect semblance of understanding have not yet aroused the true; all are named deliberate mind. Therefore the Treatise says: "At that time they pass the mind-ground and dwell in the work of wisdom." If the true is aroused, then it is the work of wisdom; if the true is not aroused, they are still in the mind-ground. These persons born there: those who analyze dharmas are dull; those who embody dharmas are sharp; distinct persons have already practiced the provisional and are slightly sharp; perfect persons are first already in the middle and are most sharp. Since there is the distinction of sharp and dull, in their cultivation and study there are the two benefits of sequential and non-sequential. Also these sequential and non-sequential [benefits] use the two responses of the twenty-five samadhis. This is the ninth: people are born in the expedient land; beginning in that land they see all having self-nature and obtain the most-real benefit. If distinguished in speech, the expedient land is outside the three realms; if in the matter itself it is true, it need not be far. Below it says: "If one can deeply believe and understand, then one sees the Buddha always on Vulture Peak, with great bodhisattvas and the assembly of sravakas surrounding him as he speaks dharma." This is the meaning of the expedient land.

十番、實報土益者，即實報土人益也。八番中有兩人生方便土，又二人悉破無明見實相者，方得生彼。但無明重數甚多，雖三賢十聖住於實報，報未盡猶有殘惑，更用王三昧四十一番益之。至於妙覺，豎窮橫遍，不生不滅；不生不滅，無明永盡，智慧圓足，故言不生不滅。又機感滿足，利益究竟，故言不生不滅。若分別為言，謂實報在方便之外；若即事而真，此亦不遠。文云：「觀見娑婆，瑠璃為地，坦然平正，諸臺樓觀，眾寶所成，純諸菩薩，咸處其中。」即實報土意也。
> Tenth, real-reward land benefit: this is the benefit of people in the real-reward land. In the eighth application there are two people born in the expedient land, and another two who fully break ignorance and see the real mark then can be born there. But the heavy number of ignorances is very many; though the three worthies and ten sages dwell in real-reward, their retribution is not yet exhausted and there are still residual delusions; further one uses the king samadhi to benefit them in forty-one applications. Up to wondrous enlightenment, vertically exhaust and horizontally pervade, there is no birth and no death; no birth and no death means ignorance is permanently exhausted and wisdom is perfectly complete, therefore it is said no birth and no death. Moreover, stimuli and responses are fulfilled and benefit is ultimate, therefore it is said no birth and no death. If distinguished in speech, the real-reward is outside the expedient; if in the matter itself it is true, this also is not far. The text says: "Beholding Saha, lapis-lazuli as the ground, level and even, towers and palaces all made of treasures, purely bodhisattvas all dwelling therein." This is the meaning of the real-reward land.

若麁、妙機，若別、圓應，若淨、穢土，若淺、深益，不出十番，包括法界，利益略周，大意可見，不俟繁文。是為大通佛所，毒鼓損生，聞有遠近，死有奢促；天鼓增道，聞有遠近。故令益有深、淺，致有業通願，應諸眷屬利益也。
> Whether coarse or subtle stimuli, whether distinct or perfect responses, whether pure or defiled lands, whether shallow or deep benefits, they do not go beyond the ten applications; they encompass the dharma realm, benefits are roughly complete, the great meaning can be seen, not waiting for prolix words. This is for the Great-Universal Buddha: the poison drum harms life, with hearing near and far, death long and short; the heaven drum increases the path, with hearing near and far. Therefore benefits are made to have deep and shallow, resulting in karma, penetration, and vow, responding to all retinue benefits.
