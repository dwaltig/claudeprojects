### Why Supernatural Powers After Resonance

前論機應，止是辨其可生、可赴之相；若正論化用益他，即是三輪不思議化：謂身輪、口輪、他心輪。

> Previously we discussed stimulus-response—simply analyzing the marks of what can arise and what can be approached. Now we **directly discuss transformative function benefiting others**—these are the **Three Wheels of Inconceivable Transformation**: Body-wheel, Speech-wheel, and Other-mind-wheel.

---

### The Three Wheels

〈普門品〉但有二文，而兼得三意。「遊於娑婆世界」即是身輪；「而為說法」即是口輪。如見蓮華大，知池水深；若見說法大，則知智慧大。故兩輪兼示他心輪也。

> The *Universal Gateway Chapter* has only two texts but encompasses three meanings:
> - "**Roaming in the Sahā world**" is the **Body-wheel**
> - "**Expounding the Dharma for them**" is the **Speech-wheel**
> 
> Like seeing a large lotus and knowing the pond is deep—if one sees great Dharma-exposition, one knows wisdom is great. Hence **two wheels imply the Mind-wheel**.

### Six Types of Supernatural Powers

今且依六種：謂天眼、天耳、他心、宿命、如意身通、無漏等也。

> Now following the **six types**: heavenly-eye, heavenly-ear, other-mind-knowledge, past-life-knowledge, supernormal-body-transformation, and outflow-free powers.

---

### What Is "Supernatural"?

此六皆稱神通者，如《瓔珞》云：「神名天心，通名慧性。」天心者，天然之心也。慧性者，通達無礙也。

> All six are called "supernatural powers." The *Yingluo Jing* says: "**'Supernatural' means heavenly mind; 'powers' means wisdom-nature.**"
> - **Heavenly mind** = natural mind
> - **Wisdom-nature** = penetrating without obstruction

《毘曇》亦云障通，無知若去即發慧性也。當知天然慧性與六法相應，即能轉變自在，故名神通。

> The *Abhidharma* also says: "When obstructions are penetrated and ignorance is removed, wisdom-nature arises." When **natural wisdom-nature corresponds with the six dharmas**, one can **transform freely**—hence called supernatural powers.

---

### Real Transformation vs. Illusion

《釋論》云：「幻術事是虛誑法，法於草木，誑惑人眼，物實不變。」神通不爾，實得變法，使物實變...

> The *Śāstra* says: "**Magical arts are deceptive dharmas**—they work on grass and trees, deceiving human eyes, but things don't actually change." **Supernatural powers are not like this**—they really transform dharmas, making things actually change...

如地有成水之理，水有成地之義。若金、銀得火則融，水遇寒則結；火、寒是融、結法。結則實結，融則實融；若得天然慧性，則實能如此變用自在。

> Like earth has the principle of becoming water; water has the principle of becoming earth. When gold or silver meets fire, they melt; when water meets cold, it freezes. Fire and cold are melting and freezing dharmas. **Freezing is real freezing; melting is real melting**—when one attains natural wisdom-nature, one can **truly transform freely** like this.

## Supernatural Powers Across Teachings

諸教神通不同：

> Supernatural powers differ across teachings:

| Teaching | Type of Powers | Description |
|----------|----------------|-------------|
| **Ghosts/Spirits** | Karmic-retribution | Born with powers |
| **Humans** | Medicine-induced | Through herbs/alchemy |
| **Externalists** | Root-meditation | From fundamental dhyāna |
| **Tripiṭaka** | Abandonment-based | Through eight liberations |
| **Common** | Body-dharma-based | Through instant-emptiness wisdom |
| **Distinct** | Sequential | Pre-ground: five powers; ground-entry: true outflow-free |
| **Perfect** | Non-intentional | Middle-way powers arising naturally |

---

### Perfect Teaching Supernatural Powers

圓教通者，依今經及《普賢觀》，以鼻、舌兩根，以為六數。

> **Perfect Teaching powers**: According to this sūtra and the *Samantabhadra Contemplation*, the nose and tongue roots are counted among the six.

六根皆智慧，即互用意也。

> **All six roots are wisdom**—this is the meaning of mutual function.

今云六根之通，不因事禪而發，此乃中道之真。真自有通，任運成就，不須作意，故名無記化化禪。

> Now we say the **powers of six roots do not arise from mundane dhyāna**—this is the **truth of the Middle Way**. The truth itself has penetration, **naturally accomplished without intentional effort**—hence called "neutral transformation-upon-transformation dhyāna."

---

### The Distinction of Perfect Powers

論其修習，皆緣實相常住之理。文云：「得是常眼根清淨。」既言是常，即本性清淨；常性無垢染。

> Discussing their cultivation: **all condition reality-mark constant-abiding principle**. The text says: "Attaining this constant eye-root purity." Since it says "constant," it refers to **originally-pure nature**; constant nature has no defilement.

彼者於佛為自，於眾生為彼；眾生謂為無常，於如來是常也。減修者，依禪而修，名為減脩；依實相修，名無減修。

> "That one" refers to Buddha as self, to sentient beings as other. Sentient beings consider it impermanent; **for the Tathāgata it is constant**. "Diminished cultivation" means depending on dhyāna—called diminished cultivation. **Depending on reality-mark is undiminished cultivation**.

## Coarse and Subtle Powers

### Coarse Powers

三藏、通教等聖...悉名為麁。譬如圖畫，盡思竭力，終不似真，名之為麁。

> Tripiṭaka and Common Teaching sages... are all called **coarse**. Like a **painting**—exhausting thought and effort, ultimately not resembling the real—this is called coarse.

### Subtle Powers

若明鏡寫容，任運相似，名之為妙。方便神通，譬如麁畫；中道任運，即對即應，譬於淨鏡，故為妙也。

> Like a **bright mirror reflecting form**—naturally resembling—this is called subtle. **Expedient supernatural powers are like a coarse painting; Middle-Way natural powers are like a pure mirror**—hence subtle.

---

## Supernatural Powers in the Five Flavors

五味教中用神通者：

| Flavor | Powers Usage |
|--------|--------------|
| **Milk** (*Avataṃsaka*) | One coarse, one subtle |
| **Curds** (*Tripiṭaka*) | One coarse only |
| **Fresh Butter** (*Vaipulya*) | Three coarse, one subtle |
| **Clarified Butter** (*Prajñā*) | Two coarse, one subtle |
| **Ghee** (*Lotus Sūtra*) | **One subtle only** |

此經神力，若多若少，唯為一妙。

> **This sūtra's supernatural powers, whether many or few, are solely for the one subtle.**

## Ten Auspicious Signs in the Opening Chapter

所以〈序品〉中瑞相有十，咸皆表妙也：

> The *Introduction Chapter*'s ten auspicious signs **all express subtlety**:

| # | Sign | Represents |
|---|------|------------|
| 1 | "Ground entirely purified" | **Realm Subtlety** |
| 2 | "Light emitted between brows" | **Wisdom Subtlety** |
| 3 | "Entering samādhi" | **Practice Subtlety** |
| 4 | "Heaven raining four flowers" | **Position Subtlety** |
| 5 | "Sandalwood fragrant wind" | **Vehicle Subtlety** |
| 6 | "Four assemblies all had doubt" | **Machine** |
| 7 | "Seeing 18,000 lands" | **Response** |
| 8 | "Ground shaking six ways" | **Supernatural Powers Subtlety** |
| 9 | "Heavenly drum self-sounding" + "Dharma expounded" | **Dharma-exposition Subtlety** |
| 10 | "Dragons/gods greatly rejoicing" | **Retinue Subtlety** |
| 11 | "Seeing Buddha-children cultivating various practices" | **Benefits Subtlety** |

文云：「今佛入于三昧，是不可思議！現希有事！」現希有事，是妙神通也。

> The text says: "Now the Buddha enters samādhi—this is inconceivable! Manifesting rare events!" **Manifesting rare events is subtle supernatural powers.**

---

## Opening Coarse to Reveal Subtle

今經非但妙者為妙，亦無復有麁，絓是前來諸麁，悉皆決了，為一平等大慧妙法門也。

> **This sūtra not only has subtle as subtle, but also has no more coarse.** All previous coarseness is thoroughly clarified—becoming the **one equal great-wisdom subtle dharma-gate**.

唯一大佛事因緣，曾無他事，假同九界神通。眾生，自謂他事；於佛，常是佛事。客作自謂賤人；長者審知是子。

> **Only the one great Buddha-matter cause-and-condition**—never any other matter. Even seemingly matching nine-realm supernatural powers: sentient beings consider them other matters; **for Buddha, they are always Buddha-matters**. The guest-laborer considers himself lowly; the elder truly knows he is his son.

---

## Footnotes

[^1]: The **Three Wheels** (輪) of transformation—body, speech, and mind—represent the Buddha's three modes of teaching. The wheel metaphor suggests constant turning/activity and the ability to crush obstacles. Master Zhiyi emphasizes that subtle supernatural powers arise naturally from Middle-Way realization, unlike the intentional effort required for coarse powers.
