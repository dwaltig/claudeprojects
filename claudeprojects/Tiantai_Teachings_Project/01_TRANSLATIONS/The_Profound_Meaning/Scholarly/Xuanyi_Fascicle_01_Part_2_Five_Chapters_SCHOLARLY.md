## General and Particular Interpretations

釋此五章，有通、有別。

> In interpreting these five chapters, there is the *general* (通) and the *particular* (別).

通是同義，別是異義。

> The general refers to shared meaning; the particular refers to distinctive meaning.

如此五章，遍解眾經，故言同也。

> These five chapters can be used to interpret all sūtras—hence they are called "shared."

釋名名異，乃至判教教異，故言別也。

> Yet the Name differs [for each sūtra], and so on through to the Teaching classification—hence they are called "distinctive."

例眾經之初，皆安五事，則同義也。如是詮異，我聞人異，一時感應異，佛住處所異，若干人聽眾異，則別義也。

> As an example: at the beginning of every sūtra, five items are established—this is the shared meaning.[^1] But "Thus" (*evam*) is interpreted differently, the "I heard" refers to different persons, the "one time" refers to different occasions of resonance, the Buddha's dwelling place differs, and the assembly of listeners differs—this is the distinctive meaning.

又通者，共義；別者，各義。如此通、別，專在一部。

> Again, "general" means *collective* meaning; "particular" means *individual* meaning. This general-and-particular [analysis] is directed specifically at this one text.

通則七番共解，別則五重各說。

> The general [approach] consists of **seven shared interpretations** (七番共解). The particular [approach] consists of **five layers of individual exposition** (五重各說).

例如利鈍，須廣略二門也。

> Just as [the teaching must accommodate] the sharp and the dull, it requires both the extensive and the concise approaches.

眾教通別，今所不論；一經通別，今當辨。

> The general and particular aspects of all teachings—that is not our present concern. The general and particular aspects of this one sūtra—that is what we shall now analyze.

---

## The Seven Shared Interpretations (七番共解)

△就通作七番共解：

> ▷ The general [approach] employs seven shared interpretations:

一、標章；二、引證；三、生起；四、開合；五、料簡；六、觀心；七、會異。

> 1. **Establishing the Chapters** (標章)
> 2. **Citing Evidence** (引證)
> 3. **Demonstrating the Arising** (生起)
> 4. **Opening and Combining** (開合)
> 5. **Critical Discrimination** (料簡)
> 6. **Observing the Mind** (觀心)
> 7. **Reconciling Differences** (會異)

---

### The Purpose of Each Interpretation

標章令易憶持，起念心故。

> **Establishing the Chapters** makes them easy to memorize and retain, arousing the *mind of mindfulness* (念心).

引證據佛語，起信心故。

> **Citing Evidence** relies on the Buddha's words, arousing the *mind of faith* (信心).

生起使不雜亂，起定心故。

> **Demonstrating the Arising** prevents confusion and disorder, arousing the *mind of concentration* (定心).

開合、料簡、會異等，起慧心故。

> **Opening and Combining**, **Critical Discrimination**, and **Reconciling Differences** arouse the *mind of wisdom* (慧心).

觀心即聞、即行，起精進心故。

> **Observing the Mind** means to hear and immediately practice, arousing the *mind of vigor* (精進心).

五心立，成五根，排五障，成五力，乃至入三脫門。

> When the Five Minds are established, they become the Five Faculties (五根).[^2] They dispel the Five Hindrances (五障), become the Five Powers (五力), and lead even to entry into the Three Gates of Liberation (三脫門).[^3]

略說七重，共意如此。

> This is a summary of the seven levels and their shared purpose.

---

### The Detailed Exposition

廣解五章者，一一廣起五心、五根，令開、示、悟、入佛之知見耳。

> The detailed interpretation of the Five Chapters causes each to extensively arouse the Five Minds and the Five Faculties, enabling one to *open, reveal, awaken to, and enter* the Buddha's knowledge and vision.[^4]

---

## Chapter 1: Interpreting the Name (釋名)

○初標五章(云云)。標名為四：一、立；二、分別；三、結；四、譬。

> ○ First, establishing the Five Chapters... The establishment of the Name has four aspects: (1) Establishing, (2) Distinguishing, (3) Concluding, (4) Illustrating with metaphor.

---

### 1. Establishing the Name

立名者，原聖建名，蓋為開深以進始，咸令視聽，俱得見聞，尋途趣遠，而至於極，故以名名法，施設眾生。

> **Establishing:** The original sage established names in order to open what is profound and advance those at the beginning. He caused all to look and listen, enabling all to see and hear. Following the path, they proceed from afar and arrive at the ultimate. Therefore, names are used to designate the Dharma, providing for sentient beings.

---

### 2. Distinguishing Coarse and Wonderful

分別者，但法有麁妙，若隔歷三諦，麁法也；圓融三諦，妙法也。

> **Distinguishing:** Dharmas may be *coarse* or *wonderful*. If the Three Truths are held as separate and sequential, it is the coarse Dharma. If the Three Truths are perfectly interfused, it is the Wonderful Dharma.[^5]

此妙諦本有，文云「是法住法位，世間相常住。唯我知是相，十方佛亦然。」

> This Wonderful Truth is originally existent. The text says: "This Dharma abides in its Dharma-position; the worldly marks are eternally abiding. Only I know this mark, and the Buddhas of the ten directions likewise."[^6]

尚非不退菩薩、入證二乘所知，況復人天群萌之類。

> Even non-retrogressing bodhisattvas and the Two Vehicles who have entered realization cannot know it—how much less the masses of humans and devas!

佛雖知是，不務速說。

> Though the Buddha knows this, he does not hasten to teach it.

文云「我若讚佛乘，眾生沒在苦。謗法不信故，墜於三惡道。」

> The text says: "If I were to praise the Buddha Vehicle, beings immersed in suffering, slandering the Dharma and lacking faith, would fall into the three evil paths."[^7]

所以初教建立融不融，小根併不聞；次教建立不融，大根都不用；次教俱建立，以融斥不融，令小根恥不融，慕於融；次教俱建立，令小根寄融向不融，令大根從不融向於融。

> Therefore, when the first teaching establishes both interfusion and non‑interfusion, the small roots do not hear it; the next teaching establishes non‑interfusion, and the great roots do not use it; the next teaching establishes both, using interfusion to reject non‑interfusion, causing the small roots to feel ashamed of non‑interfusion and long for interfusion; the next teaching establishes both, causing the small roots to rely on interfusion and move toward non‑interfusion, and the great roots to move from non‑interfusion toward interfusion.

雖種種建立，施設眾生，但隨他意語，非佛本懷故，言不務速說也。

> Though there are various establishments and provisions for beings, they are merely words that accord with others’ intentions and are not the Buddha’s original intent; therefore he does not urgently speak them.
今經正直捨不融，但說於融，令一座席同一道味，乃暢如來出世本懷，故建立此經，名之為妙。

> Now, this present sūtra directly sets aside the unfused and teaches only the fused, causing the entire assembly to share one flavor of the Way. This fully expresses the Tathāgata's original intention in appearing in the world. Therefore this sūtra is established and named "Wonderful."

---

### 3. Concluding Statement

結者，當知《華嚴》兼，《三藏》但，《方等》對，《般若》帶。

> **Concluding:** You should understand that the *Avataṃsaka* (華嚴) *includes* [the One Vehicle with the separate vehicles]; the *Tripiṭaka* (三藏) teaches *only* [the separate vehicles]; *Vaipulya* (方等) *contrasts* [One with Three]; *Prajñā* (般若) *carries* [the Three while teaching the One].[^8]

此經無復兼、但、對、帶，專是正直無上之道，故稱為妙法也。

> This sūtra no longer includes, only-teaches, contrasts, or carries. It is exclusively the direct, unsurpassed Way. Therefore it is called the Wonderful Dharma.

---

### 4. The Lotus Metaphor

譬蓮華者，例有麁妙。

> **Illustrating with metaphor:** The lotus flower likewise has coarse and wonderful [examples].

云何？麁狂華無果，或一華多菓，或多華一菓，或一華一菓，或前菓後華，或前華後菓。

> How so? A coarse, wild flower has no fruit. Or one flower with many fruits. Or many flowers with one fruit. Or one flower with one fruit. Or fruit before flower. Or flower before fruit.

初喻外道，空修梵行，無所剋獲。次喻凡夫，供養父母，報在梵天。次喻聲聞，種種苦行，止得涅槃。次喻緣覺，一遠離行，亦得涅槃。次喻須陀洹，却後修道。次喻菩薩，先籍緣修，生後真修。

> The first illustrates non-Buddhists who cultivate pure conduct in vain and gain nothing. The second illustrates ordinary beings who serve their parents and are reborn in the Brahma heavens. The third illustrates śrāvakas who practice various austerities and merely attain nirvāṇa. The fourth illustrates pratyekabuddhas who practice one form of renunciation and also attain nirvāṇa. The fifth illustrates stream-enterers who later progress on the path. The sixth illustrates bodhisattvas who first rely on conditioned cultivation and later attain true cultivation.

皆是麁華，不以為喻。

> All of these are coarse flowers and are not used as the metaphor.

蓮華多奇：為蓮故華，華實具足，可喻即實而權；又華開蓮現，可喻即權而實；又華落蓮成，蓮成亦落，可喻非權非實。

> The lotus flower has many extraordinary [qualities]: **The flower exists for the sake of the lotus**—flower and fruit are complete together—this can metaphor *the Real manifesting through the Provisional*. **The flower opens and the lotus appears**—this can metaphor *the Provisional revealing the Real*. **The flower falls and the lotus matures; the mature lotus also falls**—this can metaphor *neither Provisional nor Real*.

如是等種種義便故，以蓮華喻於妙法也。

> Because of these many convenient meanings, the lotus flower is used to metaphor the Wonderful Dharma.

---

## Chapter 2: Discerning the Substance (辨體)

體者為四：一、釋字。二、引同。三、簡非。四、結正。

> The Substance has four aspects: (1) Explaining the character, (2) Citing agreement, (3) Discriminating what is not [the Substance], (4) Concluding the correct [Substance].

體字訓禮。

> The character *tǐ* (體, substance) is glossed as *lǐ* (禮, propriety).

禮，法也：各親其親，各子其子，君臣撙節。

> Propriety is Dharma: each cherishes its own kin, each child serves its own parents, rulers and ministers keep to proper measure.

若無禮者，則非法也。

> If there is no propriety, then it is not Dharma.

出世法體，亦復如是，善惡、凡聖、菩薩、佛，一切不出法性。

> The substance of supramundane Dharma is likewise: good and evil, ordinary and sage, bodhisattva and Buddha—all do not depart from Dharma‑nature.

正指實相，以為正體也。

> [The teaching] directly points to *True Reality* (實相) and takes it as the correct Substance.

故〈壽量品〉云「不如三界，見於三界，非如非異。」

> Therefore, the "Lifespan" chapter says: "Unlike the three realms, yet seeing the three realms—neither same nor different."[^9]

若三界人見三界為異，二乘人見三界為如，菩薩人見三界亦如亦異，佛見三界非如非異、雙照如異。

> If beings in the three realms see the three realms as different; if the Two Vehicles see the three realms as the same; if bodhisattvas see the three realms as both same and different; the Buddha sees the three realms as neither same nor different—illumining both same and different.

今取佛所見為實相正體也。

> Now we take what the Buddha sees as the correct Substance of True Reality.

金剛藏說「佛甚微智」，辭異意同。

> Vajragarbha says, "The Buddha's wisdom is extremely subtle." The wording differs, but the meaning is the same.

其辭曰：「空有、不二、不異、不盡。」

> His words are: "Empty and existent; non-dual, non-different, inexhaustible."

空非斷無，故言空有。

> Emptiness is not annihilative nothingness; therefore it is said "empty and existent."

有即是空，空即是有，故言不二。

> Existence is precisely emptiness; emptiness is precisely existence—therefore non-dual.

非離空有外，別有中道，故言不異。

> There is no Middle Way apart from emptiness and existence; therefore it is called non-different.

遍一切處，故言不盡。

> It pervades all places; therefore it is called inexhaustible.

此亦與龍樹意同。

> This also accords with Nāgārjuna's intent.

《中論》云「因緣所生法，即空、即假、即中。」

> The *Madhyamaka-śāstra* says: "Dharmas arising from causes and conditions are precisely emptiness, precisely provisional, precisely the middle."

因緣所生法即空者，此非斷無也。

> That dharmas arising from causes and conditions are emptiness is not annihilative nothingness.

即假者，不二也。

> "Precisely provisional" means non-dual.

即中者，不異也。

> "Precisely the middle" means non-different.

因緣所生法者，即遍一切處也。

> "Dharmas arising from causes and conditions" means pervading all places.

今言實相體，即權而實，離斷無謗也；即實而權，離建立謗也；權實即非權實，離異謗也；雙照權實，遍一切處，離盡謗也。

> Now, speaking of the Substance of True Reality: it is Provisional-yet-Real, thereby avoiding the slander of annihilative nothingness; it is Real-yet-Provisional, thereby avoiding the slander of reification; the Provisional-and-Real are precisely not-Provisional-and-Real, thereby avoiding the slander of difference; it illuminates both Provisional and Real, pervading all places, thereby avoiding the slander of exhaustion.

斯乃總二經之雙美，申兩論之同致，顯二家之懸會，明今經之正體也。

> This gathers the dual excellence of the two sūtras, extends the shared purport of the two śāstras, manifests the convergence of the two schools, and clarifies the correct Substance of this present sūtra.

私謂實相之法，橫破凡夫之四執，竪破三聖之證得。

> I say that the Dharma of True Reality horizontally breaks the four attachments of ordinary beings and vertically breaks the attainments of the three sages.

破凡夫可解。

> Breaking ordinary beings is easy to understand.

破聖者，三藏二乘，指但空為極。

> As for breaking the sages: the Two Vehicles of the Tripiṭaka take only-emptiness as ultimate.

譬頗梨珠，一往似真，再研便偽。

> It is like a crystal jewel: at first glance it seems real; polished again, it proves false.

身子云：「我等同入法性，失於如來無量知見。」

> Śāriputra said: "We have all entered the Dharma-nature together, yet we have lost the immeasurable knowledge and vision of the Tathāgata."

空有之旨，正破此證也。

> The meaning of emptiness and existence precisely breaks this attainment.

通教人，指但空、不但空共為極。

> People of the Common Teaching take both only-emptiness and not-only-emptiness together as ultimate.

譬雜色裹珠，光隨色變。

> It is like a jewel wrapped in mixed colors; its light changes with the colors.

緣所見之光，亡其本體；逐玄黃之色，墮落二乘。

> Chasing the light as seen, they lose its original substance; pursuing the blue and yellow colors, they fall into the Two Vehicles.

《大經》云「聲聞之人，但見於空，不見不空。」

> The *Great Sūtra* says: "Śrāvakas only see emptiness, and do not see non-emptiness."

菩薩之人，非但見空，亦見不空。

> Bodhisattvas not only see emptiness; they also see non-emptiness.

所見既殊，不二之旨正破此證也。

> Since what is seen is different, the principle of non-duality precisely breaks this attainment.

別教人，指不但空為極。

> People of the Distinct Teaching take not-only-emptiness as ultimate.

逈出二邊，如雲外月，棄邊取中，如捨空求空，不異之旨，正破此證。

> They go far beyond the two extremes, like the moon beyond the clouds; discarding the extremes and taking the middle, like abandoning emptiness to seek emptiness—the principle of non-difference precisely breaks this attainment.

若彼有此無，則正法不遍，不盡之旨，亦破此證也。

> If they have this and lack that, then the True Dharma does not pervade; the principle of inexhaustibility also breaks this attainment.

此等皆非佛甚微智，不與金剛藏意同。

> All of these are not the Buddha's extremely subtle wisdom, and do not accord with Vajragarbha's intent.

非佛證得本有常住，不與〈方便品〉同。

> They are not the Buddha's realization of the originally existent permanence, and do not accord with the "Skillful Means" chapter.

不遍一切處，不與〈壽量品〉同。

> They do not pervade all places, and do not accord with the "Lifespan" chapter.

既不會正體，攝屬何法？

> If they do not comprehend the correct Substance, to what Dharma do they belong?

但空，是化他之實；但不但，是自行化他之實。

> Only-emptiness is the Real of transforming others; not-only-emptiness is the Real of both self-practice and transforming others.

出二邊中，是自行之權。

> Emerging from the two extremes and entering the middle is the Provisional of self-practice.

並他經所說，非今體也。

> These are all what other sūtras teach; they are not the Substance of this present [sūtra].

今經體者，體化他之權實，即是自行之權實，如垢衣內身，實是長者。

> The Substance of this sūtra is the Provisional-and-Real of transforming others; this is precisely the Provisional-and-Real of self-practice—like the body within soiled clothing: in truth it is a wealthy elder.

體自行化他之權實，即是自行之權實，如衣內繫珠，即無價寶也。

> The Provisional-and-Real of self-practice and transforming others is precisely the Provisional-and-Real of self-practice—like a pearl tied within the garment: it is a priceless jewel.

自行之權，即自行之實。

> The Provisional of self-practice is precisely the Real of self-practice.

如一切世間，治生產業，皆與實相不相違背。

> As for all worldly activities—governing and livelihood—none are in conflict with True Reality.

一色一香，無非中道。

> One form, one fragrance—none is not the Middle Way.

況自行之實而非實耶！

> How much less could the Real of self-practice be non-Real!

---

## Chapter 3: Clarifying the Essence (明宗)

宗者為三：一、示。二、簡。三、結。

> The Essence has three aspects: (1) Indicating, (2) Discriminating, (3) Concluding.

宗者，要也。所謂佛自行因果，以為宗也。

> *Essence* (*zōng* 宗) means *essential*. The Buddha's own practice of cause and effect is taken as the Essence.

云何為要？無量眾善，言因則攝；無量證得，言果則攝。如提綱維，無目而不動；牽衣一角，無縷而不來。

> What makes it essential? Immeasurable goods—speak of "cause" and they are included. Immeasurable realizations—speak of "effect" and they are included. It is like lifting the main cord of a net: no mesh fails to move. It is like pulling one corner of a garment: no thread fails to follow.

故言宗要。

> Therefore it is called the "essential essence."

然諸因果，善須明識，尚不取別教因果，況餘因果！

> Yet as for these causes and fruits, they must be clearly recognized; we do not even take the Distinct Teaching's causes and fruits—how much less other causes and fruits!

餘因果者，昔三因大異，而三果小同；又三因大同，而三果小異。

> Other causes and fruits: formerly the three causes were greatly different, while the three fruits were slightly the same; again, the three causes were greatly the same, while the three fruits were slightly different.

又一因逈出，一果不融。

> Again, one cause is far beyond, and one fruit is not fused.

因不攝善，果不收德，則非佛自行之因，非佛道場證得之果。

> If the cause does not include goodness and the fruit does not gather virtue, then it is not the Buddha's self-practice cause and not the fruit realized at the Buddha's seat of enlightenment.

又簡者，諸經明佛往昔所行因果，悉皆被拂，咸是方便，非今經之宗要。

> Further, in discrimination: the causes and fruits of the Buddha's past practice as explained in other sūtras are all set aside; all are expedient, and not the essential gist of this sūtra.

取意為言，因窮久遠之實修，果窮久遠之實證，如此之因，竪高七種方便，橫包十法界法。

> Speaking by intent: the cause exhausts the real cultivation of the remotest past; the fruit exhausts the real realization of the remotest past. Such a cause vertically towers above the seven kinds of expedients and horizontally includes the dharmas of the ten Dharma-realms.

初修此實相之行，名為佛因，道場所得，名為佛果。

> The initial cultivation of this practice of True Reality is called the Buddha-cause; what is attained at the seat of enlightenment is called the Buddha-fruit.

但可以智知，不可以言具。

> It can only be known by wisdom; it cannot be fully expressed in words.

略舉如此因果，以為宗要耳。

> Briefly citing such causes and fruits—this is the essential gist.

---

## Chapter 4: Discussing the Function (論用)

用者為三：一、示。二、簡。三、益。

> The Function has three aspects: (1) Indicating, (2) Discriminating, (3) Benefits.

用者，力用也。三種權實二智，皆是力用。

> *Function* (*yòng* 用) means *power and function*. The three kinds of Provisional-and-Real dual wisdom are all power and function.[^10]

於力用中，更分別：自行二智，照理理周，名為力；二種化他二智，鑒機機遍，名為用。

> Within power and function, further distinction is made: The dual wisdom of self-practice, which illuminates principle thoroughly—this is called *power*. The two kinds of dual wisdom for transforming others, which discerns capacities universally—this is called *function*.

如薩婆悉達彎祖王弓滿，名為力；中七鐵鼓，貫一鐵圍山，洞地徹水輪，名為[A1]用。

> Like Sarvārthasiddha drawing the ancestral king's bow to the full—this is called power; hitting seven iron drums, piercing an iron encircling mountain, boring through the earth and penetrating the water wheel—this is called [A1] function.

諸方便教，力用微弱，如凡人弓箭。

> The various expedient teachings have weak power and function, like an ordinary person's bow and arrows.

何者？昔緣稟化他二智，照理不遍，生信不深，除疑不盡。

> Why is this so? Formerly, relying on the dual wisdom for transforming others, illumination of principle was not universal, faith was not deep, and doubts were not fully removed.

今緣稟自行二智，極佛境界，起法界信，增圓妙道，斷根本惑，損變易生。

> Now, relying on the dual wisdom of self-practice, one reaches the Buddha's realm, gives rise to faith in the Dharma-realm, increases the perfectly wonderful path, cuts off fundamental delusions, and diminishes transformed birth-and-death.

非但生身、及生身得忍兩種菩薩俱益，法身、法身後心兩種菩薩亦俱益。

> Not only the two kinds of bodhisattvas with physical bodies and those who attain patience within the physical body are benefited; the two kinds of bodhisattvas with Dharma-bodies and post-mind of the Dharma-body are also benefited.

化功廣大，利潤弘深，蓋茲經之力用也。

> The transforming merit is vast and great; the benefit is profound and deep. This is the power and function of this sūtra.

    [A1] 用【CB】，月【大】

> [A1] "Use" (用) in CBETA; "Moon" (月) in the Taishō edition.

---

## Chapter 5: Classifying the Teaching (判教)

教相為三：一、根性融、不融相。二、化道始終、不始終相。三、師弟遠近、不遠近相。

> The Teaching Classification has three aspects: (1) The marks of root-natures as fused or unfused. (2) The marks of the path of transformation as complete or incomplete. (3) The marks of teacher and disciple as remote or near.

教者，聖人被下之言也；相者，分別同異也。

> *Teaching* (教) refers to the sage's words bestowed upon those below. *Marks* (相) refers to distinguishing sameness and difference.

云何分別？

> How are they distinguished?

---

### The Five Flavors

如日初出，前照高山，厚殖善根，感斯頓說。頓說本不為小，小雖在座，如聾如瘂，良由小不堪大，亦是大隔於小，此如《華嚴》。

> It is like the sun first rising, first illuminating the high mountains. Those who had thickly planted good roots were moved by this sudden teaching. The sudden teaching was not originally for those of lesser [capacity]. Though the lesser sat in the assembly, they were like the deaf or mute. This is because the small cannot bear the great, and the great is separated from the small. This is like the *Avataṃsaka*.

約法被緣，緣得大益，名頓教相。約說次第，名從牛出乳味相。

> Considered in terms of Dharma matching conditions, it is called the **Sudden Teaching Mark**. Considered in terms of the sequence of teaching, it is called the **Milk-from-the-Cow Flavor Mark**.[^11]

次照幽谷，淺行偏明當分漸解，此如三藏。

> Next it illuminates the dark valleys; shallow practice is partially clarified and gradually understood in its own measure—this is like the Tripiṭaka.

三藏本不為大，大雖在座，多跢婆和，小所不識，此乃小隔於大，大隱於小。

> The Tripiṭaka was not originally for the Great; though the Great sat in the assembly, many were *duota‑pohe*, and the small could not recognize it—this is the small separated from the great, and the great hidden within the small.

約法被緣，名漸教相。

> In terms of Dharma matching conditions, it is called the Gradual Teaching Mark.

約說次第，名酪味相。

> In terms of teaching sequence, it is called the **Curds Flavor Mark**.

次照平地，影臨萬水，逐器方圓，隨波動靜，示一佛土，令淨穢不同。

> Next it illuminates the level ground; its shadow approaches the ten thousand waters, following vessels as square or round and following waves as moving or still, revealing a single Buddha‑land yet making purity and impurity differ.

示現一身，巨細各異，一音說法，隨類各解，恐畏、歡喜厭離、斷疑、神力不共，故見有淨、穢，聞有褒、貶，嗅有薝蔔、不薝蔔，華有著身、不著身，慧有若干、不若干，此如《淨名》、《方等》。

> It manifests a single body with great and small each differing; with one voice it teaches the Dharma, each kind understanding in its own way—fear, joy, revulsion, cutting off doubt, and supernatural powers are not shared. Therefore one sees purity and impurity, hears praise and blame, smells champak or not champak, flowers either adhere to the body or not, and wisdom is more or less—this is like the *Vimalakīrti* and *Vaipulya*.

約法被緣，猶是漸教。

> In terms of Dharma matching conditions, it is still a gradual teaching.

約說次第，生蘇味相。

> In terms of teaching sequence, it is the **Fresh Butter Flavor Mark**.

復有義，大人蒙其光用，嬰兒喪其睛明；夜遊者伏匿，作務者興成。

> There is another meaning: great persons receive its light and benefit, while infants lose their brightness of the eyes; those who wander at night hide, and those who work rise and thrive.

故文云「但為菩薩說其實事，而不為我說斯真要。」

> Therefore the text says: "It only speaks true matters for the bodhisattvas, and does not speak this true essential for me."

雖三人俱學，二乘取證，具如《大品》。

> Though the three persons all study, the Two Vehicles take realization—this is fully like the *Great Perfection of Wisdom*.

若約法被緣，猶是漸教。

> In terms of Dharma matching conditions, it is still a gradual teaching.

約說次第，名熟蘇味相。

> In terms of teaching sequence, it is called the **Clarified Butter Flavor Mark**.

復有義，日光普照，高下悉均平。

> There is yet another meaning: the sunlight shines everywhere, high and low all equally level.

土圭測影，不縮不盈。

> The gnomon measuring the shadow neither shortens nor lengthens.

若低頭，若小音，若散亂，若微善，皆成佛道。

> Whether one bows the head, speaks in a small voice, is scattered, or has slight goodness—all accomplish the Buddha Way.

不令有人獨得滅度，皆以如來滅度而滅度之。

具如今經。

> This is fully like the present sūtra.

若約法被緣，名漸圓教。

> In terms of Dharma matching conditions, it is called the gradual-perfect teaching.

若說次第，醍醐味相。

### The Lotus Sutra's Unique Position

今《法華》是顯露，非祕密；是漸頓，非漸漸；是合，非不合；是醍醐非四味；是定，非不定。

> Now, this *Lotus Sūtra* is **revealed**, not secret. It is **gradual-becoming-sudden**, not gradual-upon-gradual. It is **unified**, not disunified. It is **ghee**, not the [previous] four flavors. It is **definite**, not indefinite.

如此分別，此經與眾經相異也。

> By these distinctions, this sūtra differs from all other sūtras.

    [A2] 醍醐【CB】，醐醍【大】(cf. T49n2035_p0161c05; X29n0599_p0621b02)

> [A2] "Ghee" (醍醐) in CBETA; "huti" (醐醍) in the Taishō edition (cf. T49n2035_p0161c05; X29n0599_p0621b02).

又異者，餘教當機益物，不說如來施化之意。

> Further difference: other teachings benefit beings according to their capacities but do not speak the Tathāgata's intent in carrying out transformation.

此經明佛設教元始，巧為眾生作頓、漸、不定、顯密種子，中間以頓、漸五味調伏長養而成熟之，又以頓漸五味而度脫之。

> This sūtra clarifies the Buddha's original establishment of teaching, skillfully making sudden, gradual, indeterminate, and revealed/secret seeds for sentient beings. In the middle he uses the sudden and gradual Five Flavors to tame, nurture, and mature them, and again uses the sudden and gradual Five Flavors to liberate them.

並脫、並熟、並種、番番不息，大勢威猛，三世益物，具如〈信解品〉中說，與餘經異也。

> Liberation, maturation, and sowing occur together, again and again without cease. The momentum is mighty, benefiting beings across the three times. It is explained in the "Faith and Understanding" chapter—thus it differs from other sūtras.

又眾經咸云「道樹，師實智始滿；起道樹，始施權智」。

> Further, many sūtras all say: "At the Bodhi tree, the Master's real wisdom was first fulfilled; after rising from the Bodhi tree, he first applied provisional wisdom."

今經明師之權實，在道樹前久久已滿。

> This sūtra clarifies that the Master's Provisional and Real had long been fulfilled before the Bodhi tree.

諸經明二乘弟子不得入實智，亦不能施權智；今經明弟子入實甚久，亦先解行權。

> Other sūtras say that disciples of the Two Vehicles cannot enter real wisdom and cannot apply provisional wisdom; this sūtra clarifies that disciples entered the Real long ago and also first understood and practiced the Provisional.

又眾經尚不論道樹之前，師之與弟，近近權實，況復遠遠；今經明道樹之前，權實長遠，補處數世界不知，況其塵數！

> Moreover, other sūtras do not even discuss the time before the Bodhi tree—let alone the distant past—whereas this sūtra clarifies that before the Bodhi tree the Provisional and Real were long distant, such that even a successor-bodhisattva across many worlds does not know it, much less dust-motes in number.

經云「昔所未曾說，今皆當得聞」，殷勤稱讚，良有以也。

> The sūtra says: "What was never spoken in the past, now all can hear." It praises this earnestly for good reason.

當知此經，異諸教也。

> You should know that this sūtra differs from the other teachings.

## Footnotes

[^1]: The "five items" at the beginning of every sūtra refers to the standard opening formula: "Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha dwelt at [place], with a great assembly of [beings]."

[^2]: **Five Faculties** (五根): Faith, Vigor, Mindfulness, Concentration, and Wisdom.

[^3]: **Three Gates of Liberation** (三脫門): Emptiness (*śūnyatā*), Signlessness (*animitta*), and Wishlessness (*apraṇihita*).

[^4]: "Open, reveal, awaken to, and enter" (開示悟入) are the famous four verbs from *Lotus Sūtra* Chapter 2, describing the Buddha's purpose for appearing in the world.

[^5]: **Three Truths** (三諦): Emptiness (*kōng* 空), Provisional Existence (*jiǎ* 假), and the Middle (*zhōng* 中). This is the cardinal doctrine of Tiantai.

[^6]: *Lotus Sūtra*, Chapter 2 ("Skillful Means").

[^7]: *Lotus Sūtra*, Chapter 2.

[^8]: This is a classic Tiantai doctrinal schema summarizing the Buddha's teaching career: *Avataṃsaka* includes the One Vehicle alongside the separate vehicles; *Tripiṭaka* teaches only the separate vehicles; *Vaipulya* contrasts Great and Small Vehicles; *Prajñā* carries the Three Vehicles while gradually revealing the One.

[^9]: *Lotus Sūtra*, Chapter 16 ("The Lifespan of the Tathāgata").

[^10]: "Three kinds of Provisional-and-Real dual wisdom" refers to: (1) wisdom of self-practice, (2) wisdom for transforming others, and (3) the unity of both.

[^11]: The **Five Flavors** (五味) represent the Buddha's teaching career as progressive stages of refinement, like the production of ghee from milk: Milk (乳) → Curds (酪) → Fresh Butter (生蘇) → Clarified Butter (熟蘇) → Ghee (醍醐). This schema comes from the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*.

[^12]: **Ghee** (醍醐, *tíhú*): The final, most refined product in the Five Flavors schema—representing the *Lotus Sūtra* as the ultimate, integrative teaching.
