## General and Particular Interpretations

釋此五章，有通、有別。

> In interpreting these five chapters, there is the *general* (通) and the *particular* (別).

通是同義，別是異義。

> The general refers to shared meaning; the particular refers to distinctive meaning.

如此五章，遍解眾經，故言同也。

> These five chapters can be used to interpret all sūtras—hence they are called "shared."

釋名名異，乃至判教教異，故言別也。

> Yet the Name differs [for each sūtra], and so on through to the Teaching classification—hence they are called "distinctive."

例眾經之初，皆安五事，則同義也。如是詮異，我聞人異，一時感應異，佛住處所異，若干人聽眾異，則別義也。

> As an example: at the beginning of every sūtra, five items are established—this is the shared meaning.[^1] But "Thus" (*evam*) is interpreted differently, the "I heard" refers to different persons, the "one time" refers to different occasions of resonance, the Buddha's dwelling place differs, and the assembly of listeners differs—this is the distinctive meaning.

又通者，共義；別者，各義。如此通、別，專在一部。

> Again, "general" means *collective* meaning; "particular" means *individual* meaning. This general-and-particular [analysis] is directed specifically at this one text.

通則七番共解，別則五重各說。

> The general [approach] consists of **seven shared interpretations** (七番共解). The particular [approach] consists of **five layers of individual exposition** (五重各說).

例如利鈍，須廣略二門也。

> Just as [the teaching must accommodate] the sharp and the dull, it requires both the extensive and the concise approaches.

眾教通別，今所不論；一經通別，今當辨。

> The general and particular aspects of all teachings—that is not our present concern. The general and particular aspects of this one sūtra—that is what we shall now analyze.

---

## The Seven Shared Interpretations (七番共解)

△就通作七番共解：

> ▷ The general [approach] employs seven shared interpretations:

一、標章；二、引證；三、生起；四、開合；五、料簡；六、觀心；七、會異。

> 1. **Establishing the Chapters** (標章)
> 2. **Citing Evidence** (引證)
> 3. **Demonstrating the Arising** (生起)
> 4. **Opening and Combining** (開合)
> 5. **Critical Discrimination** (料簡)
> 6. **Observing the Mind** (觀心)
> 7. **Reconciling Differences** (會異)

---

### The Purpose of Each Interpretation

標章令易憶持，起念心故。

> **Establishing the Chapters** makes them easy to memorize and retain, arousing the *mind of mindfulness* (念心).

引證據佛語，起信心故。

> **Citing Evidence** relies on the Buddha's words, arousing the *mind of faith* (信心).

生起使不雜亂，起定心故。

> **Demonstrating the Arising** prevents confusion and disorder, arousing the *mind of concentration* (定心).

開合、料簡、會異等，起慧心故。

> **Opening and Combining**, **Critical Discrimination**, and **Reconciling Differences** arouse the *mind of wisdom* (慧心).

觀心即聞、即行，起精進心故。

> **Observing the Mind** means to hear and immediately practice, arousing the *mind of vigor* (精進心).

五心立，成五根，排五障，成五力，乃至入三脫門。

> When the Five Minds are established, they become the Five Faculties (五根).[^2] They dispel the Five Hindrances (五障), become the Five Powers (五力), and lead even to entry into the Three Gates of Liberation (三脫門).[^3]

略說七重，共意如此。

> This is a summary of the seven levels and their shared purpose.

---

### The Detailed Exposition

廣解五章者，一一廣起五心、五根，令開、示、悟、入佛之知見耳。

> The detailed interpretation of the Five Chapters causes each to extensively arouse the Five Minds and the Five Faculties, enabling one to *open, reveal, awaken to, and enter* the Buddha's knowledge and vision.[^4]

---

## Chapter 1: Interpreting the Name (釋名)

○初標五章(云云)。標名為四：一、立；二、分別；三、結；四、譬。

> ○ First, establishing the Five Chapters... The establishment of the Name has four aspects: (1) Establishing, (2) Distinguishing, (3) Concluding, (4) Illustrating with metaphor.

---

### 1. Establishing the Name

立名者，原聖建名，蓋為開深以進始，咸令視聽，俱得見聞，尋途趣遠，而至於極，故以名名法，施設眾生。

> **Establishing:** The original sage established names in order to open what is profound and advance those at the beginning. He caused all to look and listen, enabling all to see and hear. Following the path, they proceed from afar and arrive at the ultimate. Therefore, names are used to designate the Dharma, providing for sentient beings.

---

### 2. Distinguishing Coarse and Wonderful

分別者，但法有麁妙，若隔歷三諦，麁法也；圓融三諦，妙法也。

> **Distinguishing:** Dharmas may be *coarse* or *wonderful*. If the Three Truths are held as separate and sequential, it is the coarse Dharma. If the Three Truths are perfectly interfused, it is the Wonderful Dharma.[^5]

此妙諦本有，文云「是法住法位，世間相常住。唯我知是相，十方佛亦然。」

> This Wonderful Truth is originally existent. The text says: "This Dharma abides in its Dharma-position; the worldly marks are eternally abiding. Only I know this mark, and the Buddhas of the ten directions likewise."[^6]

尚非不退菩薩、入證二乘所知，況復人天群萌之類。

> Even non-retrogressing bodhisattvas and the Two Vehicles who have entered realization cannot know it—how much less the masses of humans and devas!

佛雖知是，不務速說。

> Though the Buddha knows this, he does not hasten to teach it.

文云「我若讚佛乘，眾生沒在苦。謗法不信故，墜於三惡道。」

> The text says: "If I were to praise the Buddha Vehicle, beings immersed in suffering, slandering the Dharma and lacking faith, would fall into the three evil paths."[^7]

所以初教建立融不融，小根併不聞...

> Therefore, in the First Teaching, both fused and unfused [truths] were established, yet those of lesser capacity did not even hear it...

[Content continues through the Five Periods of teaching]

今經正直捨不融，但說於融，令一座席同一道味，乃暢如來出世本懷，故建立此經，名之為妙。

> Now, this present sūtra directly sets aside the unfused and teaches only the fused, causing the entire assembly to share one flavor of the Way. This fully expresses the Tathāgata's original intention in appearing in the world. Therefore this sūtra is established and named "Wonderful."

---

### 3. Concluding Statement

結者，當知《華嚴》兼，《三藏》但，《方等》對，《般若》帶。

> **Concluding:** You should understand that the *Avataṃsaka* (華嚴) *includes* [the One Vehicle with the separate vehicles]; the *Tripiṭaka* (三藏) teaches *only* [the separate vehicles]; *Vaipulya* (方等) *contrasts* [One with Three]; *Prajñā* (般若) *carries* [the Three while teaching the One].[^8]

此經無復兼、但、對、帶，專是正直無上之道，故稱為妙法也。

> This sūtra no longer includes, only-teaches, contrasts, or carries. It is exclusively the direct, unsurpassed Way. Therefore it is called the Wonderful Dharma.

---

### 4. The Lotus Metaphor

譬蓮華者，例有麁妙。

> **Illustrating with metaphor:** The lotus flower likewise has coarse and wonderful [examples].

云何？麁狂華無果，或一華多菓，或多華一菓，或一華一菓，或前菓後華，或前華後菓。

> How so? A coarse, wild flower has no fruit. Or one flower with many fruits. Or many flowers with one fruit. Or one flower with one fruit. Or fruit before flower. Or flower before fruit.

初喻外道，空修梵行，無所剋獲。次喻凡夫，供養父母，報在梵天。次喻聲聞，種種苦行，止得涅槃。次喻緣覺，一遠離行，亦得涅槃。次喻須陀洹，却後修道。次喻菩薩，先籍緣修，生後真修。

> The first illustrates non-Buddhists who cultivate pure conduct in vain and gain nothing. The second illustrates ordinary beings who serve their parents and are reborn in the Brahma heavens. The third illustrates śrāvakas who practice various austerities and merely attain nirvāṇa. The fourth illustrates pratyekabuddhas who practice one form of renunciation and also attain nirvāṇa. The fifth illustrates stream-enterers who later progress on the path. The sixth illustrates bodhisattvas who first rely on conditioned cultivation and later attain true cultivation.

皆是麁華，不以為喻。

> All of these are coarse flowers and are not used as the metaphor.

蓮華多奇：為蓮故華，華實具足，可喻即實而權；又華開蓮現，可喻即權而實；又華落蓮成，蓮成亦落，可喻非權非實。

> The lotus flower has many extraordinary [qualities]: **The flower exists for the sake of the lotus**—flower and fruit are complete together—this can metaphor *the Real manifesting through the Provisional*. **The flower opens and the lotus appears**—this can metaphor *the Provisional revealing the Real*. **The flower falls and the lotus matures; the mature lotus also falls**—this can metaphor *neither Provisional nor Real*.

如是等種種義便故，以蓮華喻於妙法也。

> Because of these many convenient meanings, the lotus flower is used to metaphor the Wonderful Dharma.

---

## Chapter 2: Discerning the Substance (辨體)

體者為四：一、釋字。二、引同。三、簡非。四、結正。

> The Substance has four aspects: (1) Explaining the character, (2) Citing agreement, (3) Discriminating what is not [the Substance], (4) Concluding the correct [Substance].

體字訓禮。禮，法也...

> The character *tǐ* (體, substance) is glossed as *lǐ* (禮, propriety/law). Propriety means law...

正指實相，以為正體也。

> [The teaching] directly points to *True Reality* (實相) and takes it as the correct Substance.

故〈壽量品〉云「不如三界，見於三界，非如非異。」

> Therefore, the "Lifespan" chapter says: "Unlike the three realms, yet seeing the three realms—neither same nor different."[^9]

今取佛所見為實相正體也。

> Now we take what the Buddha sees as the correct Substance of True Reality.

---

## Chapter 3: Clarifying the Essence (明宗)

宗者為三：一、示。二、簡。三、結。

> The Essence has three aspects: (1) Indicating, (2) Discriminating, (3) Concluding.

宗者，要也。所謂佛自行因果，以為宗也。

> *Essence* (*zōng* 宗) means *essential*. The Buddha's own practice of cause and effect is taken as the Essence.

云何為要？無量眾善，言因則攝；無量證得，言果則攝。如提綱維，無目而不動；牽衣一角，無縷而不來。

> What makes it essential? Immeasurable goods—speak of "cause" and they are included. Immeasurable realizations—speak of "effect" and they are included. It is like lifting the main cord of a net: no mesh fails to move. It is like pulling one corner of a garment: no thread fails to follow.

故言宗要。

> Therefore it is called the "essential essence."

---

## Chapter 4: Discussing the Function (論用)

用者為三：一、示。二、簡。三、益。

> The Function has three aspects: (1) Indicating, (2) Discriminating, (3) Benefits.

用者，力用也。三種權實二智，皆是力用。

> *Function* (*yòng* 用) means *power and function*. The three kinds of Provisional-and-Real dual wisdom are all power and function.[^10]

於力用中，更分別：自行二智，照理理周，名為力；二種化他二智，鑒機機遍，名為用。

> Within power and function, further distinction is made: The dual wisdom of self-practice, which illuminates principle thoroughly—this is called *power*. The two kinds of dual wisdom for transforming others, which discerns capacities universally—this is called *function*.

化功廣大，利潤弘深，蓋茲經之力用也。

> The transforming merit is vast and great; the benefit is profound and deep. This is the power and function of this sūtra.

---

## Chapter 5: Classifying the Teaching (判教)

教相為三：一、根性融、不融相。二、化道始終、不始終相。三、師弟遠近、不遠近相。

> The Teaching Classification has three aspects: (1) The marks of root-natures as fused or unfused. (2) The marks of the path of transformation as complete or incomplete. (3) The marks of teacher and disciple as remote or near.

教者，聖人被下之言也；相者，分別同異也。

> *Teaching* (教) refers to the sage's words bestowed upon those below. *Marks* (相) refers to distinguishing sameness and difference.

---

### The Five Flavors

如日初出，前照高山，厚殖善根，感斯頓說。頓說本不為小，小雖在座，如聾如瘂，良由小不堪大，亦是大隔於小，此如《華嚴》。

> It is like the sun first rising, first illuminating the high mountains. Those who had thickly planted good roots were moved by this sudden teaching. The sudden teaching was not originally for those of lesser [capacity]. Though the lesser sat in the assembly, they were like the deaf or mute. This is because the small cannot bear the great, and the great is separated from the small. This is like the *Avataṃsaka*.

約法被緣，緣得大益，名頓教相。約說次第，名從牛出乳味相。

> Considered in terms of Dharma matching conditions, it is called the **Sudden Teaching Mark**. Considered in terms of the sequence of teaching, it is called the **Milk-from-the-Cow Flavor Mark**.[^11]

次照幽谷...此如三藏...名酪味相。

> Next it illuminates the dark valleys... This is like the *Tripiṭaka*... called the **Curds Flavor Mark**.

次照平地...此如《淨名》、《方等》...生蘇味相。

> Next it illuminates the level ground... This is like *Vimalakīrti* and *Vaipulya*... the **Fresh Butter Flavor Mark**.

...具如《大品》...熟蘇味相。

> ...as in the *Great Perfection of Wisdom*... the **Clarified Butter Flavor Mark**.

...具如今經...醍醐味相。

> ...as in this present sūtra... the ***Ghee* Flavor Mark**.[^12]

---

### The Lotus Sutra's Unique Position

今《法華》是顯露，非祕密；是漸頓，非漸漸；是合，非不合；是醍醐非四味；是定，非不定。

> Now, this *Lotus Sūtra* is **revealed**, not secret. It is **gradual-becoming-sudden**, not gradual-upon-gradual. It is **unified**, not disunified. It is **ghee**, not the [previous] four flavors. It is **definite**, not indefinite.

如此分別，此經與眾經相異也。

> By these distinctions, this sūtra differs from all other sūtras.

## Footnotes

[^1]: The "five items" at the beginning of every sūtra refers to the standard opening formula: "Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha dwelt at [place], with a great assembly of [beings]."

[^2]: **Five Faculties** (五根): Faith, Vigor, Mindfulness, Concentration, and Wisdom.

[^3]: **Three Gates of Liberation** (三脫門): Emptiness (*śūnyatā*), Signlessness (*animitta*), and Wishlessness (*apraṇihita*).

[^4]: "Open, reveal, awaken to, and enter" (開示悟入) are the famous four verbs from *Lotus Sūtra* Chapter 2, describing the Buddha's purpose for appearing in the world.

[^5]: **Three Truths** (三諦): Emptiness (*kōng* 空), Provisional Existence (*jiǎ* 假), and the Middle (*zhōng* 中). This is the cardinal doctrine of Tiantai.

[^6]: *Lotus Sūtra*, Chapter 2 ("Skillful Means").

[^7]: *Lotus Sūtra*, Chapter 2.

[^8]: This is a classic Tiantai doctrinal schema summarizing the Buddha's teaching career: *Avataṃsaka* includes the One Vehicle alongside the separate vehicles; *Tripiṭaka* teaches only the separate vehicles; *Vaipulya* contrasts Great and Small Vehicles; *Prajñā* carries the Three Vehicles while gradually revealing the One.

[^9]: *Lotus Sūtra*, Chapter 16 ("The Lifespan of the Tathāgata").

[^10]: "Three kinds of Provisional-and-Real dual wisdom" refers to: (1) wisdom of self-practice, (2) wisdom for transforming others, and (3) the unity of both.

[^11]: The **Five Flavors** (五味) represent the Buddha's teaching career as progressive stages of refinement, like the production of ghee from milk: Milk (乳) → Curds (酪) → Fresh Butter (生蘇) → Clarified Butter (熟蘇) → Ghee (醍醐). This schema comes from the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*.

[^12]: **Ghee** (醍醐, *tíhú*): The final, most refined product in the Five Flavors schema—representing the *Lotus Sūtra* as the ultimate, integrative teaching.
