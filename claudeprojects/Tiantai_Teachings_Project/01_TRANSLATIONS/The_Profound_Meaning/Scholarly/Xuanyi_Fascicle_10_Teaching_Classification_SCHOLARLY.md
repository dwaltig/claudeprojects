# The Fifth Chapter: Teaching Classification (教相)

## △大章第五、釋教相

若弘餘經，不明教相，於義無傷；若弘《法華》，不明教者，文義有闕。

> "If promoting other sūtras, **not clarifying teaching-classification causes no harm**; if promoting the *Lotus Sūtra*, **not clarifying teaching-classification leaves the text-and-meaning incomplete**."

---

## Why Teaching Classification Is Essential for the Lotus

今經不爾，絓是法門網目，大小觀法，十力無畏，種種規矩，皆所不論，為前經已說故。

> "This sūtra isn't like that—**all dharma-gate catalogs, great-and-small contemplation methods, Ten Powers, Fearlessnesses, various regulations—none are discussed**, because prior sūtras already explained them."

但論如來布教之元始，中間取與漸頓適時，大事因緣，究竟終訖。

> "It **only discusses the Tathāgata's original beginning of teaching-deployment**, the middle period's giving-and-withdrawing with gradual-and-sudden matching the time, **the Great Cause-and-Condition, and the ultimate conclusion**."

## The Three Great Structures

### 1. Three Kinds of Teaching (教)

| Category | Chinese | Meaning |
|----------|---------|---------|
| **Sudden** | 頓 | Direct teaching without stages |
| **Gradual** | 漸 | Sequential teaching through stages |
| **Indeterminate** | 不定 | Neither fixed sudden nor gradual |

### 2. Five Periods (五時)

The Buddha's teaching career divided into five periods, metaphorized by the Five Flavors of dairy:

| Period | Chinese | Teaching | Flavor |
|--------|---------|----------|--------|
| 1 | **華嚴** | *Avataṃsaka* — for high bodhisattvas | **Milk** (乳) |
| 2 | **阿含** | *Āgamas* — Tripiṭaka for Two Vehicles | **Curds** (酪) |
| 3 | **方等** | *Vaipulya* — scolding small, praising great | **Fresh Butter** (生蘇) |
| 4 | **般若** | *Prajñāpāramitā* — emptiness for all | **Clarified Butter** (熟蘇) |
| 5 | **法華涅槃** | *Lotus* and *Nirvāṇa* — ultimate | **Ghee** (醍醐) |

## Critique of Other Schools (出異解)

Master Zhiyi surveys **ten different teaching-classification systems** from the South and North, critiquing each:

### Southern Schools (南三)
1. **Huqiu Master Jie** — Five Periods with "Reality Teaching"
2. **Zonglai/Zhuangyan/Min** — Four Periods with "Returning Teaching"
3. **Dinglin Rou/Daoguang** — Five Periods with "Praise-and-Blame Teaching"

### Northern Schools (北七)
4. **Northern Masters** — *Tíwèi* as Human-Heaven Teaching
5. **Bodhiruci** — Half-Full (半滿) Teaching
6. **Buddhabhadra/Guangtong** — Four Tenets
7. **Protecting-Body Master** — Five Tenets with Dharma-Realm
8. **Qishelin** — Six Tenets with True and Round
9. **Northern Chan Masters** — Two Great Vehicles (with/without marks)
10. **Northern Chan Masters** — One Sound Teaching

## Zhiyi's Critique Summary

每一家皆有所失：

| System | What It Gets | What It Loses |
|--------|--------------|---------------|
| **Five Periods** | Gets expedient | Loses single-path real |
| **Half-Full** | Gets real intent | Loses expedient intent |
| **Four Tenets** | Gets structure | Loses Five-Flavor expedience |
| **One Sound** | Gets real wisdom | Loses expedient wisdom |

---

## The Correct Teaching Classification

### The Three Proofs (引三文證)

Master Zhiyi establishes his system with **three textual proofs**:

| Proof | Text | Evidence |
|-------|------|----------|
| 1 | **Skillful Means Chapter** | Describes sudden first, then gradual |
| 2 | **Sūtra of Immeasurable Meanings** | Five periods in order |
| 3 | **Trust-and-Understanding Chapter** | Four Voice-Hearers' parable matches progression |

## Five Flavors and Half-Full Combined (五味半滿相成)

若直論五味，猶同南師，但得方便；若直半滿，猶同北師，但得其實。今明五味不離半滿，半滿不離五味。

> "If discussing Five Flavors alone, it's like Southern masters—only gets expedient. If discussing Half-Full alone, it's like Northern masters—only gets real. **Now I clarify: Five Flavors don't depart from Half-Full; Half-Full doesn't depart from Five Flavors.**"

| Period | Flavor | Half/Full |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| **Huayan** | Milk | Full only (唯滿不半) |
| **Āgama** | Curds | Half only (唯半不滿) |
| **Vaipulya** | Fresh Butter | Half-Full opposed (半滿相對) |
| **Prajñā** | Clarified Butter | Carrying half, discussing full (帶半論滿) |
| **Lotus** | Ghee | Abandoning half, clarifying full (廢半明滿) |

## Opening and Combining (開合)

### The Four Teaching System (四教)

| Teaching | Chinese | Characteristic |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Tripiṭaka** | 藏教 | Analytical emptiness |
| **Shared** | 通教 | Embodied emptiness |
| **Distinct** | 別教 | Sequential Middle Way |
| **Perfect** | 圓教 | Immediate Middle Way |

從一開一者，十方佛土中，唯有一乘法，眾生不解，全生如乳...

> "**Opening one from one**: In Buddha-lands of ten directions, there is only One-Vehicle Dharma. Beings don't understand—entirely raw like milk... [Then various levels of opening until perfect]"

---

## The Master's Conclusion

師云：我以五章，略譚玄義，非能申文外之妙，特是粗述所懷。

> "**The Master said**: With these five chapters, I've briefly discussed the Profound Meaning. This cannot express the subtlety beyond the text—it's merely a rough statement of what I hold in mind."

常恨言不能暢意，況復記能盡言！

> "I constantly regret that **words cannot fully express meaning**—how much more can records exhaust words!"

若能尋七義，次通十妙，研別體七，餘五鉤瑣相承，宛宛如繡，引經印定，句句環合...

> "If one can **seek the seven meanings, penetrate the Ten Subtleties, research the seven distinguishing Substances, and the remaining five linked in succession**, it will be like embroidery, **citing sūtras to confirm, sentence by sentence interlocking**..."

圓通之道，於斯通矣！遍朗之朗，於茲明矣！

> "**The path of perfect penetration is opened here! Universal illumination is illuminated here!**"

## Footnotes

[^1]: The **Five Periods** (五時) represent Master Zhiyi's temporal classification of the Buddha's teaching career, integrating the *Nirvāṇa Sūtra*'s Five Flavors metaphor with historical teaching content.

[^2]: The **Four Teachings** (四教) represent Zhiyi's doctrinal classification: Tripiṭaka (藏), Shared (通), Distinct (別), and Perfect (圓).

[^3]: The synthesis of **Five Periods + Half-Full + Four Teachings** creates the complete Tiantai teaching-classification system that became standard in East Asian Buddhism.
