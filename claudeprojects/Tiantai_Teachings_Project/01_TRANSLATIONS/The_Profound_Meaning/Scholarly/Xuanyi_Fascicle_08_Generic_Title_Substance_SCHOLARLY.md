# Part One: The Generic Title — "Sūtra" (經)

## 第二、釋通名

脩多羅，或云脩單蘭，或云脩妬路。

> **Sūtra** [Chinese: 經] has varying transliterations: xiūduōluó, xiūdānlán, or xiūdùlù—due to regional dialect differences.

---

## The Debate: Translatable or Not?

釋此為五：一、明無翻。二、明有翻。三、和融有無。四、歷法明經。五、觀心明經。

> Explaining this has **five sections**:
> 1. Why it cannot be translated
> 2. Why it can be translated
> 3. Harmonizing both views
> 4. Explaining "sūtra" through dharmas
> 5. Explaining "sūtra" through mind-contemplation

## Part 1: Five Meanings That Cannot Be Translated (無翻五義)

言無翻者，彼語多含，此語單淺，不可以單翻複。

> The argument for **no translation**: That language has multiple meanings; this language is single and shallow—**cannot use single to translate multiple**.

舊云：經含五義：

> The old teaching says: **"Sūtra" has five meanings**:

| # | Meaning | Chinese | Explanation |
|---|---------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | **Dharma-Source** | 法本 | Source of all teaching, practice, and principle |
| 2 | **Subtle Development** | 微發 | Gradual arising and deepening |
| 3 | **Gushing Spring** | 涌泉 | Inexhaustible flow |
| 4 | **Plumb-line** | 繩墨 | Standard that cuts wrong |
| 5 | **Flower Garland** | 結鬘 | Threading together without scattering |

---

### 1. Dharma-Source (法本)

所言教本者，金口所說一言為本，流出無量言教。

> **Teaching-source**: "What the golden mouth speaks with one word as source **flows out as immeasurable verbal teachings**."

經是行本者，示人無諍法，導達通塞。

> **Practice-source**: Shows people the non-contention dharma, guides through obstructions.

經是義本者，尋一句詮於一義，尋無量句詮無量義。

> **Principle-source**: Following one sentence expresses one meaning; following immeasurable sentences expresses immeasurable meanings.

---

### 2. Subtle Development (微發)

初聞世界悉檀，次第領受，分別法相，微有解生，漸漸增長。

> "Initially hearing worldly siddhānta, sequentially receiving and differentiating dharma-marks, **subtle understanding arises, gradually increasing**."

---

### 3. Gushing Spring (涌泉)

佛以四悉檀說法，文義無盡，法流不絕。

> "Buddha using four siddhāntas to teach—**text and meaning are inexhaustible, dharma-flow is unceasing**."

---

### 4. Plumb-Line (繩墨)

裁愛見之邪教，不為邪風倒惑。

> "**Cutting the deviant teachings of craving and views**, not overturned by deviant winds."

---

### 5. Flower Garland (結鬘)

結教行理，如結華鬘，令不零落。

> "**Threading together teaching, practice, and principle—like stringing a flower garland**, not allowing them to scatter."

---

## Part 2: Five Meanings That Can Be Translated (有翻五義)

| # | Translation | Meaning |
|---|-------------|---------|
| 1 | **Sūtra** (經) | "Passage through"—all passes through the sage's mind |
| 2 | **Contract** (契) | Fits beings, fits events, fits principle |
| 3 | **Dharma-Source** (法本) | As above |
| 4 | **Thread** (線) | Sews teaching, practice, principle together |
| 5 | **Good Teaching** (善語教) | Teaching of good words, actions, principles |

---

## Part 3: Harmonizing Both (和融有無)

今和融有無，虛豁義趣。

> "Now **harmonizing translatable and untranslatable**, opening up the meaning."

若等是無翻，何不標微發、涌泉等？今正用經，於多含義強。

> "If equally untranslatable, why not mark it as 'subtle development' or 'gushing spring'? **Now correctly using 'sūtra' because it is strongest among multiple meanings.**"

含三法本、三微發、三涌泉、諸繩墨、結鬘等義，亦含契、線、善語教、訓法、訓常等，無不攝在經一字中。

> "[Sūtra] **contains three dharma-sources, three subtle developments, three gushing springs, all plumb-lines, flower garlands... all absorbed in the single character 經**."

---

## Summary: Fifteen Meanings of "Sūtra"

Master Zhiyi expands the traditional five to **fifteen**:

| Original | × 3 Aspects | = |
|----------|-------------|---|
| 5 Untranslatable | Teaching, Practice, Principle | 15 |
| 5 Translatable | Also 3 aspects each | 15 |

> "The old teaching says sūtra contains five meanings; **now I say sūtra contains fifteen meanings**."

---

# Part Two: Substance — Reality-Mark (體)

## 第二、顯體

體者，一部之指歸，眾義之都會也。

> "**Substance** is the pointing-return of the whole text, the assembly of all meanings."

文云：「是法不可示，言辭相寂滅。」

> The text says: "**This dharma cannot be shown; the mark of verbal expression is quiescent**."

---

## Seven Topics on Substance

即為七：一、正顯經體。二、廣簡偽。三、一法異名。四、入體之門。五、遍為眾經體。六、遍為諸行體。七、遍一切法體。

> This has **seven topics**:
> 1. Directly revealing the sūtra's substance
> 2. Broadly distinguishing false from true
> 3. One dharma, different names
> 4. Gates of entry to substance
> 5. Pervading as substance of all sūtras
> 6. Pervading as substance of all practices
> 7. Pervading as substance of all dharmas

---

## Rejecting Previous Interpretations

北地師用一乘為體...今不用此解。

> "Northern masters use 'One Vehicle' as substance... **I don't use this interpretation**."

又有解言：真諦為體。此亦通濫...故不用。

> "Others say 'True-truth' is substance. This is also too general... **so I don't use it**."

又有解言：一乘因果為體。今亦不用。

> "Others say 'One-Vehicle cause-and-fruit' is substance. **I also don't use this**."

---

## The Correct Substance: Reality-Mark (實相)

三正顯體者，即一實相印也。

> "**Directly revealing substance: it is the One Reality-Mark Seal.**"

三軌之中，取真性軌。十法界中，取佛法界。佛界十如是中，取如是體。

> "Among Three Tracks, take True Nature Track. Among Ten Dharma-Realms, take Buddha Dharma-Realm. Among Buddha-realm's Ten Suchnesses, **take Such-Body**."

---

## Proof Texts

〈序品〉云：「今佛放光明，助顯實相義。」

> *Introduction Chapter*: "Now Buddha emits light, **helping to reveal Reality-Mark meaning**."

〈方便品〉云：「唯佛與佛，乃能究盡諸法實相。」

> *Skillful Means Chapter*: "**Only Buddha with Buddha can fully fathom the Reality-Mark of all dharmas**."

〈法師品〉云：「開方便門，示真實相。」

> *Dharma-Teacher Chapter*: "**Opening the expedient gate, showing true Reality-Mark**."

---

## The Three Similes for True and False

### 1. Three Beasts Crossing the River

三獸渡河，同入於水...兔、馬力弱，雖濟彼岸，浮淺不深...大象力強，俱得底岸。

> "Three beasts cross the river, entering the same water... Rabbit and horse are weak—though reaching the other shore, they float shallow, not deep... **The great elephant is strong—reaching both bottom and shore**."

水喻即空，底喻不空...菩薩獨到。

> "Water metaphorizes emptiness; bottom metaphorizes non-emptiness... **Only the bodhisattva reaches [the bottom]**."

---

### 2. Crystal vs. Wish-Fulfilling Jewel

頗梨、如意，兩珠相似...頗梨但空，不能雨寶。如意珠，亦空亦雨寶。

> "Crystal and wish-fulfilling jewel resemble each other... Crystal is merely empty, cannot rain treasures. **Wish-fulfilling jewel is both empty and rains treasures**."

---

### 3. Gold in Stone

譬如黃石中金，愚夫無識，視之謂石...估客得之，融出其金...金匠得之，造作種種...仙客得之，練為金丹，飛天入地。

> "Like gold in yellow stone: Fools don't recognize it, call it stone... Merchants get it, melt out the gold... Goldsmiths get it, make various ornaments... **Alchemists get it, refine it into elixir, fly to heaven, enter earth**."

金丹實相，以為經體也。

> "**Gold-elixir Reality-Mark is the sūtra's substance**."

---

## Footnotes

[^1]: The **fifteen meanings of sūtra** represent Master Zhiyi's characteristic expansion of traditional categories. By applying the teaching/practice/principle triad to each of the five meanings (both translatable and untranslatable sets), he shows the inexhaustible depth of even a single title-character.
