## 次解四悉檀為十重
# The Four Siddhāntas Explained in Ten Methods

---

Master Zhiyi presents a comprehensive analysis of the Four Siddhāntas through ten methodological lenses:

> 一、釋名　二、辨相　三、釋成　四、對諦　五、起教觀　六、說默　七、用不用　八、權實　九、開顯　十、通經

1. **Explaining the Names** (釋名)
2. **Distinguishing the Marks** (辨相)
3. **Interpreting the Establishment** (釋成)
4. **Correlating with the Truths** (對諦)
5. **Generating Contemplation and Teaching** (起教觀)
6. **Holy Speech and Holy Silence** (說默)
7. **Application and Non-Application** (用不用)
8. **Provisional and Real** (權實)
9. **Opening the Provisional to Reveal the Real** (開顯)
10. **Connecting with the Sūtra** (通經)

---

## 四、對諦
# Section 4: Correlating with the Four Noble Truths

---

四、對諦者，直對一番四諦，如前說。

> **Correlating with the Truths:** Directly correlating one set of Four Noble Truths, as previously explained.

廣對四種四諦者，四種四諦，一一以四悉檀對之。

> More extensively correlating the Four Kinds of Four Noble Truths: each of the four kinds is correlated with the Four Siddhāntas.

復總對者，生滅四諦對世界，無生四諦對為人，無量四諦對對治，無作四諦對第一義。

> In summary correlation:
> - **Arising-and-Ceasing Four Truths** correspond to the **Worldly Siddhānta**
> - **Non-Arising Four Truths** correspond to the **For-Each-Person Siddhānta**
> - **Immeasurable Four Truths** correspond to the **Therapeutic Siddhānta**
> - **Non-Created Four Truths** correspond to the **First-Principle Siddhānta**[^1]

---

## 五、起觀教
# Section 5: Generating Contemplation and Teaching

---

### Contemplation Arises Through the Siddhāntas

幽微之理，非觀不明；契理之觀，非悉檀不起。

> Profound and subtle principle cannot be illuminated without contemplation. Contemplation that accords with principle cannot arise without the Siddhāntas.

脩從假入空觀時，先觀正因緣法。

> When cultivating the contemplation of **entering emptiness from the provisional**, first contemplate the dharmas of correct dependent origination.

此法內、外、親、疎隔別，若不殷勤、樂欲，則所習不成，必須曉夜精勤、欣悅、無[A3]𣀇，此即世界悉檀起初觀也。

> These dharmas—inner and outer, intimate and distant—are separately distinguished. If there is no earnestness and delight, the practice will not succeed. One must diligently strive day and night with joy and without laxity. **This is the Worldly Siddhānta generating initial contemplation.**

若欲觀假入空，須識為人便宜。

> If one wishes to contemplate entering emptiness from the provisional, one must recognize what is expedient for each person.

若宜修觀，即用擇、精進、喜三覺分起之。

> If it is appropriate to cultivate contemplation, then use the three awakening factors of discrimination, vigor, and joy to arouse it.

若宜修止，則用除、捨、定三覺分起之。

> If it is appropriate to cultivate calming, then use the three awakening factors of exclusion, equanimity, and concentration to arouse it.

念通兩處，是為隨宜，善心則發。

> Mindfulness connects the two; this is following what is appropriate, and the wholesome mind then arises.

若有沈、浮之病，須用對治悉檀。若心沈時，念、擇、進、喜治之。若心浮時，念、捨、除、定治之。

> If there is the disease of **sinking** or **floating**, one must use the **Therapeutic Siddhānta**:
> - When the mind **sinks**: treat with mindfulness, discrimination, vigor, and joy.
> - When the mind **floats**: treat with mindfulness, equanimity, exclusion, and concentration.[^2]

若善用為人，善根則厚。若善用對治，煩惱則薄。

> If one skillfully employs [the For-Each-Person Siddhānta], good roots become thick. If one skillfully employs the Therapeutic [Siddhānta], afflictions become thin.

於七覺中，隨依一覺，怳然如失。即依此覺分研修，能發真明，見第一義。

> Among the Seven Factors of Awakening, following one factor, suddenly [insight arises] as if lost [to ordinary awareness]. Relying on this factor of awakening for research and cultivation, one can generate true illumination and see the First Principle.

是為用四悉檀，起從假入空觀，成一切智，發慧眼也。

> **This is using the Four Siddhāntas to generate the contemplation of entering emptiness from the provisional, accomplishing all-knowledge, and opening the Wisdom Eye.**

若從空入假觀，巧用四悉檀，取道種智，法眼亦如是。

> If [cultivating] the contemplation of **entering the provisional from emptiness**, skillfully employ the Four Siddhāntas to attain Path-Knowledge—the Dharma Eye is likewise.

若修中道第一義觀，巧用四悉檀，取一切種智，佛眼亦如是。

> If cultivating the **Middle Way First-Principle Contemplation**, skillfully employ the Four Siddhāntas to attain All-Mode-Knowledge—the Buddha Eye is likewise.

若一心三觀，巧用亦如是。

> If [practicing] **Three Contemplations in One Mind**, the skillful application is likewise.

    [A3] 𣀇【CB】，[睪*支]【大】

> [A3] 𣀇 in CBETA; [睪*支] in the Taishō edition.

### Teaching Arises Through the Siddhāntas

起教者，《大論》云：「佛常樂默然，不樂說法。」《淨名》亦論杜口。此經云：「不可以言宣」。

> **Generating Teaching:** The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* says: "The Buddha constantly delights in silence; he does not delight in teaching the Dharma." The *Vimalakīrti* also discusses closing the mouth. This sūtra says: "It cannot be proclaimed with words."

《大經》云：「生生不可說，乃至不生不生不可說」，又云：「亦可得說，十因緣法為生作因。」

> The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "The arising of arising cannot be spoken, down to the non-arising of non-arising cannot be spoken"; it also says: "It can also be spoken: the dharmas of the ten conditions make the causes for arising."

亦可得說十因緣者：從無明至有，此十成於眾生，具四根性，能感如來，說四種法。

> It can also be spoken of the ten conditions: from ignorance to existence. These ten constitute sentient beings; possessing the four root-natures, they can move the Tathāgata to speak the four kinds of Dharma.

若十因緣法所成眾生有下品樂欲，能生界內事善，拙度破惑，析法入空；具此因緣者，如來則轉生滅四諦法輪，起三藏教也。

> If sentient beings formed by the ten-factor dependent origination have **lower-grade delight**, able to generate phenomenal good within the realms, with crude methods breaking delusion and analyzing dharmas to enter emptiness—those possessing these conditions, the Tathāgata turns the Dharma Wheel of the **Arising-and-Ceasing Four Truths**, generating the **Tripiṭaka Teaching**.

若十因緣法所成眾生有中品樂欲，能生界內理善，巧度破惑，體法入空；具此因緣者，如來則轉無生四諦法輪，起通教也。

> If sentient beings formed by the ten conditions have **middle-grade delight**, able to generate inner‑realm principle good, skillfully crossing and breaking delusion, embodying dharmas to enter emptiness—those possessing these conditions, the Tathāgata turns the Dharma Wheel of the **Non‑Arising Four Truths**, generating the **Common Teaching**.

若十因緣所成眾生有上品樂欲，能生界外事善，歷別破惑，次第入中；具此因緣者，如來則轉無量四諦法輪，起別教也。

> If sentient beings formed by the ten conditions have **upper-grade delight**, able to generate outer‑realm phenomenal good, gradually breaking delusion and entering the middle in sequence—those possessing these conditions, the Tathāgata turns the Dharma Wheel of the **Immeasurable Four Truths**, generating the **Distinct Teaching**.

若十因緣所成眾生有上上品樂欲，能生界外理善，一破惑一切破惑，圓頓入中；具此因緣者，如來則轉無作四諦法輪，起圓教也。

> If sentient beings formed by the ten conditions have **highest‑grade delight**, able to generate outer‑realm principle good, breaking one delusion and breaking all delusions, entering the middle in a perfect and sudden way—those possessing these conditions, the Tathāgata turns the Dharma Wheel of the **Non‑Created Four Truths**, generating the **Perfect Teaching**.

---

## 六、說默
# Section 6: Holy Speech and Holy Silence

---

《思益》云：「佛告諸比丘：汝等當行二事，若聖說法、若聖默然。」

> The *Suvikrāntavikrāmi-paripṛcchā* says: "The Buddha told the monks: 'You should practice two things—either holy speech of Dharma, or holy silence.'"

聖說如上辨。聖默然者，夫四種四諦並是三乘聖人所證之法，非下凡所知，故不可說；假令說之，如為盲人設燭，何益無目者乎！

> Holy speech has been explained above. **Holy silence**: The four kinds of Four Noble Truths are all dharmas realized by the Three Vehicle sages, not known by lower ordinary beings. Therefore they cannot be spoken. Even if spoken, it is like setting up a candle for blind people—what benefit is there for those without eyes?

故不可說，名聖默然。

> Therefore, since it cannot be spoken, it is called **holy silence**.

---

### Forms of Holy Silence in Each Teaching

華嚴中數世界，不可說、不可說，明理極不可說、不可說。

> In the *Avataṃsaka*, counting worlds—unspeakable, unspeakable—clarifies that principle at its ultimate is unspeakable, unspeakable.

若三藏中，憍陳如比丘最初獲得真實之知見，寂然無聲字。

> In the *Tripiṭaka*, the monk Kauṇḍinya first attained true knowledge and vision—silent, without sound or letters.

身子云：「吾聞解脫之中，無有言說者。」是約生滅四諦生生之法，明不可說。

> Śāriputra said: "I have heard that within liberation, there is no verbal expression." This clarifies, based on the Arising-and-Ceasing Four Truths of the arising-of-arising dharmas, that [it] cannot be spoken.

《淨名》杜口，《大集》無言菩薩不可智知，不可識識，言語道斷，心行亦訖，不生不滅，法如涅槃。

> In the *Vimalakīrti*, [he] shuts his mouth. In the *Mahāsaṃnipāta*, the Bodhisattva of No Speech is unknowable by wisdom and unrecognized by consciousness; the path of speech is cut off, mental activity also ceases. Neither arising nor ceasing—the Dharma is like nirvāṇa.

此經明「止止不須說，我法妙難思」；「是法不可示，言辭相寂滅」，不可以言宣，非思量分別之所能解。

> This sūtra clarifies: "**Stop, stop—no need to speak. My Dharma is wonderful and hard to conceive.**" "**This Dharma cannot be shown; the marks of speech are extinguished.**" It cannot be proclaimed with words; it is not something that thought or discrimination can comprehend.

此約無作四諦，不生不生法，明不可說。不可說故，名聖默然。

> This clarifies, based on the Non-Created Four Truths of non-arising-of-non-arising dharmas, that [it] cannot be spoken. Because it cannot be spoken, it is called **holy silence**.

---

## 七、得用不得用
# Section 7: Application and Non-Application

---

夫四悉檀獨有如來究竟具得，微妙能用。下地已去，得、用不同，凡有四句：

> The Four Siddhāntas—only the Tathāgata has completely and ultimately attained them and can subtly employ them. From lower stages onward, attainment and application differ. There are four possibilities:

1. **不得不用** — Not attaining, not applying
2. **得而不用** — Attaining but not applying
3. **不得而用** — Not attaining yet applying
4. **亦得亦用** — Both attaining and applying

---

### Who Falls into Each Category

凡夫外道苦集流轉，尚不能知四悉檀名字，誰論其得？既其不得，云何能用也！

> Ordinary beings and non-Buddhists revolve in suffering and accumulation—they cannot even know the names of the Four Siddhāntas. Who speaks of their attainment? Since they do not attain, how can they apply?

若三藏教二乘殷勤自行者，知苦、斷集、修道、證滅、入真，亦名為得。不度眾生，故不能用。

> If the Two Vehicles of the Tripiṭaka Teaching diligently practice themselves—knowing suffering, cutting off accumulation, cultivating the path, realizing cessation, entering truth—this is also called **attainment**. But they do not ferry sentient beings, so they **cannot apply**.

假令用者，差機不當，故淨名訶滿願云：「不知人根，不應說法，無以穢食，置於寶器。」

> If they were to apply, they would misjudge capacities; therefore the *Vimalakīrti* reproaches Pūrṇa, saying: "Not knowing people's roots, you should not preach the Dharma; do not place impure food in a jeweled vessel."

如富樓那九旬化外道，反被蚩笑！文殊暫往，師徒皆伏。此是不知樂欲，不能用世界悉檀也。

> Like Pūrṇa, who for ninety days tried to convert the non-Buddhists but was instead ridiculed! When Mañjuśrī briefly went, both teacher and disciples submitted. **This is not knowing delight—being unable to use the Worldly Siddhānta.**

如身子教二弟子，善根不發，更生邪疑，此不能用為人悉檀也。

> Like Śāriputra teaching two disciples—good roots did not arise; instead, wrong doubts increased. **This is being unable to use the For-Each-Person Siddhānta.**

如五百羅漢為迦絺那說四諦，都無利益；佛為說不淨觀，即得破惡。此不能用對治悉檀也。

> Like the five hundred arhats teaching the Four Truths to Kātyāyana—there was no benefit at all. The Buddha taught him the impurity contemplation, and immediately evil was broken. **This is being unable to use the Therapeutic Siddhānta.**

如身子不度福增，大醫不治，小醫拱手，五百皆不度，佛度即得羅漢，此不能用第一義悉檀也。

> Like Śāriputra not ferrying Puṇyavardhana—the great physician did not treat; the small physicians folded their hands. The five hundred all failed to ferry him; the Buddha ferried him and immediately he attained arhatship. **This is being unable to use the First-Principle Siddhānta.**

---

### Progression Through the Teachings

若別教十住，但得析法、體法兩種四悉檀，而未能用；十行方能用；十迴向進得相似四悉檀，亦能相似用；登地分真得，亦分真用。

> In the Distinct Teaching at the Ten Abidings, one only attains the two kinds—analytic and embodied—of Four Siddhāntas, but cannot yet apply them. At the Ten Practices, one can apply. At the Ten Dedications, one progressively attains the resemblance Four Siddhāntas and can also apply in resemblance. Entering the Stages, one partially-truly attains and partially-truly applies.

圓教五品弟子，未能得用；六根清淨，相似得用；初住分真，得用也；唯佛究竟得、究竟用。

> In the Perfect Teaching, disciples at the Five Stages of Discipleship cannot yet attain or apply. At the Purification of the Six Senses, one attains and applies in resemblance. At the First Abiding, one partially-truly attains and applies. **Only the Buddha ultimately attains and ultimately applies.**

---

## 八、權實
# Section 8: Provisional and Real

---

四諦各辨四悉檀者，此通途說耳。

> **Provisional and Real:** That each of the Four Noble Truths distinguishes Four Siddhāntas—this is the general approach.

《釋論》云：「諸經多說三悉檀，不說第一義」者，此指三藏。

> The *Śāstra* says: "Many sūtras speak of three Siddhāntas, not speaking of the First Principle"—this refers to the Tripiṭaka.

雖爾，終是拙度，權逗小機也。

> Even so, this is ultimately a crude method, **provisionally matching lesser capacities**.

若通教四諦明四悉檀，體法即真，其門則巧故。《釋論》云：「今欲說第一義悉檀故，說《摩訶般若波羅蜜經》。」就佛、菩薩，皆得有四；而約方便真諦以明悉檀，猶屬權也。

> If the Common Teaching's Four Truths clarify the Four Siddhāntas, embodying dharmas as directly true, the gate is skillful. The *Śāstra* says: "Now, wishing to speak the First‑Principle Siddhānta, it expounds the *Mahāprajñāpāramitā Sūtra*." For Buddhas and bodhisattvas, all attain the four; yet in terms of expedient true truth used to clarify the Siddhāntas, it still belongs to the **Provisional**.

若別教四諦明四悉檀，約於中道，此意則深；而猶是歷別，別相未融，教道是權，此則非妙。

> If the Distinct Teaching's Four Truths clarify the Four Siddhāntas, based on the Middle Way—this meaning is deep. Yet it is still sequential; distinct marks are not yet fused. The teaching-path is Provisional—**this is not yet Wonderful**.

今圓教四諦明四悉檀，其相圓融，最實之說。故四悉檀，是實、是妙。

> Now, the Perfect Teaching's Four Truths clarifying the Four Siddhāntas—their marks are perfectly fused. This is the **most Real explanation**. Therefore the Four Siddhāntas are **Real** and **Wonderful**.

---

### The Five Flavors and Provisional/Real

若用此權、實約五味教者：

> If we apply this Provisional/Real to the Five Flavor Teachings:

| Teaching | Provisional? | Real? |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| **Milk (華嚴)** | 4 Provisional | 4 Real |
| **Curds (三藏)** | 4 Provisional only | — |
| **Fresh Butter (方等)** | 12 Provisional | 4 Real |
| **Clarified Butter (般若)** | 8 Provisional | 4 Real |
| **Ghee (法華)** | — | **All 4 Real** |

---

## 九、開權顯實
# Section 9: Opening the Provisional to Reveal the Real

---

一切諸法莫不皆妙，一色一香無非中道，眾生情隔於妙耳。

> All dharmas without exception are all Wonderful. **One form, one fragrance—none is not the Middle Way.** It is only that sentient beings' feelings are cut off from the Wonderful.

大悲順物，不與世諍，是故明諸權、實不同。

> Great Compassion follows beings and does not contend with the world. Therefore [the Buddha] clarifies the various Provisional and Real as different.

故《無量義》云：「四十餘年，三法、四果、二道不合」、「今開方便門，示真實相」、「唯以一大事因緣，但說無上道」、「開佛知見，悉使得入究竟實相」。

> Therefore the *Sūtra of Immeasurable Meanings* says: "For more than forty years, the Three Dharmas, Four Fruits, and Two Paths did not unite." "Now [I] open the gate of skillful means and reveal the marks of true reality." "Only for the One Great Matter as cause and condition—[I] teach only the unsurpassed Way." "Opening the Buddha's knowledge and vision, causing all to enter ultimate True Reality."

除滅化城，即是決麁；皆至寶所，即是入妙。

> Eliminating the Conjured City—this is **determining the coarse**. All reaching the Treasure Site—this is **entering the Wonderful**.

若乳教四妙，與今妙不殊。唯決其四權，入今之妙。

> If the four Wonderful [teachings] of the Milk Teaching—these are not different from today's Wonderful. Only their four Provisional [teachings] are determined to enter today's Wonderful.

決酪教四權、生蘇十二權、熟蘇八權，皆得入妙。

> Determining the four Provisional of the Curds Teaching, the twelve Provisional of the Fresh Butter Teaching, the eight Provisional of the Clarified Butter Teaching—all can enter the Wonderful.

故文云：「千二百羅漢，悉亦當作佛」。

> Therefore the text says: "**The twelve hundred arhats shall all become Buddhas.**"

又云：「決了聲聞法，是眾經之王，聞已諦思惟，得近無上道」。

> And: "**Decisively understanding the Śrāvaka Dharma—this is the King of all Sūtras. Having heard and carefully reflected, one approaches the unsurpassed Way.**"

開權顯實，其意在此。

> **Opening the Provisional to reveal the Real**—the meaning lies here.

---

## 十、通經
# Section 10: Connecting with the Sūtra

---

問：今以四悉檀通此經，此經何文明四悉檀耶？

> **Q:** Now we connect the Four Siddhāntas with this sūtra. What text in this sūtra clarifies the Four Siddhāntas?

答：文中處處皆有此意，不能具引。今略引迹本兩文。

> **A:** Throughout the text, this meaning is everywhere; I cannot cite it all. Now I briefly cite two passages from the Trace and Fundamental [teachings].

---

### From the "Skillful Means" Chapter (Trace Teaching)

〈方便品〉云：「知眾生諸行，深心之所念，過去所習業，欲性精進力，及諸根利鈍，以種種因緣，譬喻亦言辭，隨應方便說。」

> The "Skillful Means" chapter says: "Knowing the various practices of sentient beings, what their deep minds contemplate, the karmas of past cultivation, their desires, natures, vigor and power, and whether their faculties are sharp or dull—with various causes and conditions, similes and also words, [I] teach according to appropriate skillful means."[^3]

此豈非是四悉檀之語耶？

> Is this not the language of the Four Siddhāntas?

欲者即是樂欲，世界悉檀也；性者是智慧性，為人悉檀也；精進力即是破惡，對治悉檀也；諸根利鈍即是兩人得悟不同，即是第一義悉檀也。

> - **Desires** (欲) is delight—the **Worldly Siddhānta**.
> - **Natures** (性) is the nature of wisdom—the **For-Each-Person Siddhānta**.
> - **Vigor and power** (精進力) is breaking evil—the **Therapeutic Siddhānta**.
> - **Faculties sharp or dull** (諸根利鈍) is two people attaining awakening differently—the **First-Principle Siddhānta**.

---

### From the "Lifespan" Chapter (Fundamental Teaching)

又〈壽量品〉云：「如來明見，無有錯謬。以諸眾生，有種種性、種種欲、種種行、種種憶想分別故。欲令生諸善根，以若干因緣，譬喻言辭，種種說法，所作佛事，未曾暫廢。」

> The "Lifespan" chapter says: "The Tathāgata clearly sees without error. Because sentient beings have various natures, various desires, various practices, and various recollections and discriminations—wishing to cause them to generate various good roots, with numerous causes and conditions, similes, and words, [I] teach the Dharma in various ways. The Buddha's work is never even momentarily suspended."[^4]

種種性者，即是為人；種種欲者，即是世界；種種行者，即是對治；種種憶想分別，即是推理轉邪憶想得見第一義。

> - **Various natures** (種種性) is the **For-Each-Person** [Siddhānta].
> - **Various desires** (種種欲) is the **Worldly** [Siddhānta].
> - **Various practices** (種種行) is the **Therapeutic** [Siddhānta].
> - **Various recollections and discriminations** (種種憶想分別) is inferring principle, transforming wrong recollection, and seeing the **First Principle**.

兩處明文，四義具足，而皆言為眾生說法，豈非四悉檀設教之明證也！

> In both passages, the four meanings are complete; both speak of teaching the Dharma for sentient beings. **Is this not clear evidence that the Four Siddhāntas establish the teaching?**

---

## Footnotes

[^1]: The **Four Kinds of Four Noble Truths** are a distinctively Tiantai classification: (1) Arising-and-Ceasing (生滅) — Tripiṭaka; (2) Non-Arising (無生) — Common; (3) Immeasurable (無量) — Distinct; (4) Non-Created (無作) — Perfect. Each teaching has its own version of the Four Noble Truths.

[^2]: These are the **Seven Factors of Awakening** (*saptabodhyaṅga*): mindfulness, discrimination, vigor, joy, tranquility, concentration, and equanimity. Master Zhiyi divides them into groups for treating mental sinking (torpor) and floating (restlessness).
