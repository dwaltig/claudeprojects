## 五明三諦
# 5. The Three Truths Realm

---

眾經備有其義，而名出《纓珞》，《仁王》謂有諦、無諦、中道第一義諦。今經亦有其義，〈壽量〉云：「非如非異」即中道。如即真，異即俗。

> The various sutras fully contain this meaning, but the name comes from the *Yingluo*; the *Renwang* calls it Existent Truth, Non-Existent Truth, and Middle Way First-Meaning Truth. This sutra also has this meaning. The "Lifespan" chapter says: "Neither same nor different"—this is the Middle Way. "Same" is truth; "different" is conventional.

問：

> **Question:**

若此經無四種因緣等名，那用其義？

> If this sutra does not have the names "four kinds of dependent origination," etc., why use those meanings?

答：

> **Answer:**

五住、二死，名出《勝鬘》，《涅槃》不應用其義。若不用五住，則不破無明。若不用二死，則非常住。又，三佛名出《楞伽》，餘經應無三佛義。眾經皆是佛說，名乃不同，義不可壅(云云)。

> The "five dwellings" and "two deaths" take their name from the *Śrīmālā*; by that logic the *Nirvāṇa* should not use their meaning. If one does not use the five dwellings, one cannot break ignorance. If one does not use the two deaths, there is no permanence. Again, the "three Buddhas" take their name from the *Laṅkāvatāra*; by that logic other sutras should have no three-Buddha meaning. All sutras are spoken by the Buddha; names may differ, meanings must not be obstructed (and so on).

今明三諦為三：一、明三諦。二、判麁妙。三、開麁顯妙。却前兩種二諦，以不明中道故，就五種二諦，得論中道，即有五種三諦。約別入通，點非有漏非無漏，三諦義成：有漏是「俗」；無漏是「真」；非有漏非無漏是「中」。當教論中，但異空而已；中無功用，不備諸法。圓入通三諦者，二諦不異前；點非漏非無漏具一切法，與前中異也。別三諦者，開彼俗為兩諦，對真為中。中，理而已(云云)。圓入別三諦者，二諦不異前，點真中道具足佛法也。圓三諦者，非但中道具足佛法，真、俗亦然。三諦圓融，一三、三一，如《止觀》中說(云云)。

> Now we clarify the Three Truths in three [parts]: (1) clarifying the Three Truths, (2) judging coarse and subtle, (3) opening the coarse to reveal the subtle. Setting aside the first two kinds of Two Truths, because they do not clarify the Middle Way, based on the five kinds of Two Truths one can discuss the Middle Way—thus there are five kinds of Three Truths. As for Distinct-entering-Common, pointing to neither with-outflows nor without-outflows, the Three Truths meaning is established: with-outflows is "conventional"; without-outflows is "truth"; neither with-outflows nor without-outflows is "middle." In that teaching's discussion, it only differs from emptiness; the middle has no function and does not fully contain the dharmas. As for Perfect-entering-Common Three Truths, the Two Truths are not different from before; pointing to neither with-outflows nor without-outflows as containing all dharmas differs from the former middle. Distinct Three Truths: opening that conventional into two truths, contrasting truth as middle. The middle is principle only (and so on). Perfect-entering-Distinct Three Truths: the Two Truths are not different from before; pointing to the true Middle Way as fully containing Buddha-dharma. Perfect Three Truths: not only does the Middle Way fully contain Buddha-dharma; truth and conventional also do. The Three Truths are perfectly interfused—one is three, three is one—as explained in the *Zhiguan* (and so on).

二判麁妙者，別、圓入通，帶通方便，故為麁；別不帶通為妙。圓入別帶別方便為麁；圓不帶方便，最妙。

> Second, judging coarse and subtle: Distinct-entering-Common and Perfect-entering-Common carry Common expedients, therefore are coarse; Distinct not carrying Common is subtle. Perfect-entering-Distinct carries Distinct expedients, therefore is coarse; Perfect not carrying expedients is most subtle.

約五味教者，乳教說三種三諦，二麁一妙。酪教但麁無妙。生蘇、熟蘇，皆具五種三諦，四麁一妙。此經唯一種三諦，即相待妙也。

> In terms of the Five Flavors: the Milk teaching speaks of three kinds of Three Truths, two coarse and one subtle. The Curd teaching has only coarse and no subtle. Fresh butter and mature butter both have five kinds of Three Truths, four coarse and one subtle. This sutra has only one kind of Three Truths; this is the relative subtle.

三、開麁顯妙，決前諸麁入一妙，三諦無所可待，是為絕待妙也。

> Third, opening the coarse to reveal the subtle: deciding all previous coarse [teachings] enter the one subtle; the Three Truths have nothing to contrast with—this is the absolute subtle.

---

## 六、明一諦
# 6. The One Truth Realm

---

《大經》云：「所言二諦，其實是一，方便說二。如醉未吐，見日月轉，謂有轉日及不轉日。」醒人但見不轉，不見於轉。轉二為麁，不轉為妙。三藏全是轉二，同彼醉人。諸大乘經帶轉二、說不轉一。今經正直捨方便，但說無上道，不轉一實，是故為妙。

> The *Mahāparinirvāṇa* says: "What is called the Two Truths is in fact one; we expediently speak of two. It is like a drunk who has not yet vomited, seeing the sun and moon spinning, saying there is a spinning sun and a non-spinning sun." The sober person only sees non-spinning, not spinning. The two that spin are coarse; the non-spinning is subtle. The Tripiṭaka is entirely the spinning two, like that drunk person. The various Mahāyāna sutras carry the spinning two while speaking the non-spinning one. This sutra directly abandons expedients, only speaks the unsurpassed Way, the non-spinning one reality—therefore it is subtle.

《地持》明地相明義，說相似法。地實明義，說真實法。又教門方便即教道明義，說所證法即證道明義。今借用之。

> The *Daśabhūmika-sūtra-śāstra* clarifies: "clarifying by stage-marks" means explaining approximate dharmas; "clarifying by stage-reality" means explaining true real dharmas. Also, expedient teaching gates are clarification by the teaching-path; explaining the dharmas attained is clarification by the realization-path. We borrow this here.

「諸佛法久後，要當說真實」，即地實義。「道場所得法」，即是證道明義，是故妙也。

> "After a long time, the Buddhas must speak the true real"—this is the stage-reality meaning. "The dharma attained at the Bodhi-site"—this is the realization-path meaning; therefore it is subtle.

執著此實，實語是虛語，生語見故，故名為麁。融通無著是故言妙。開麁顯妙可解(云云)。

> Clinging to this real, real words are false words; because verbal views arise, it is called coarse. Penetrating without attachment is therefore called subtle. Opening the coarse to reveal the subtle can be understood (and so on).

諸諦不可說者，「諸法從本來，常自寂滅相」，那得諸諦紛紜相礙？一諦尚無，諸諦安有？一一皆不可說，可說為麁，不可說為妙。不可說亦不可說是妙，是妙亦妙，言語道斷故。若通作不可說者，生生不可說，乃至不生不生不可說。前不可說為麁，不生不生不可說為妙。若麁異妙，相待不融；麁妙不二，即絕待妙也(云云)。

> As for "the truths cannot be spoken": "All dharmas from the beginning constantly have the mark of quiescent extinction"—how could the truths be in a tangled, mutually obstructing array? If even one truth does not exist, how could the truths exist? Each and every one is unspeakable; what can be spoken is coarse, what cannot be spoken is subtle. "Unspeakable" is also unspeakable—this is subtle; "this subtle" is also subtle, because the path of words is cut off. If one comprehensively treats [them] as unspeakable: arising-arising cannot be spoken, up to non-arising-non-arising cannot be spoken. The former unspeakable is coarse; non-arising-non-arising unspeakable is subtle. If coarse differs from subtle, they are relative and not fused; if coarse and subtle are not two, this is absolute subtle (and so on).

約五味教者，乳教一麁無諦，一妙無諦。酪教一麁無諦。生蘇三麁無諦，一妙無諦。熟蘇二麁無諦，一妙無諦。此經但一妙無諦。開麁如前(云云)。

> In terms of the Five Flavors: the Milk teaching has one coarse no-truth and one subtle no-truth. The Curd teaching has one coarse no-truth. Fresh butter has three coarse no-truths and one subtle no-truth. Mature butter has two coarse no-truths and one subtle no-truth. This sutra has only one subtle no-truth. Opening the coarse is as above (and so on).

問

> **Question:**

何故大小通論無諦？

> Why do both great and small [vehicles] discuss no-truth?

答：

> **Answer:**

《釋論》云：「不破聖人心中所得涅槃，為未得者執涅槃生戲論，如緣無生使，故破。」言無諦也。

> The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* says: "We do not break the nirvāṇa attained in the sage's mind; for those who have not attained [it] and cling to nirvāṇa, producing idle talk—like conditioning the non-arising fetter—therefore we break [it]." This is called no-truth.

問：若爾，小乘得與不得俱皆被破，大乘得與不得亦俱應破。

> **Question:** If so, in the Small Vehicle both attained and not-attained are broken; should the Great Vehicle's attained and not-attained also both be broken?

答：

> **Answer:**

不例。小乘猶有別惑可除、別理可顯故，雖得須破；中道不爾，得云何破？

> Not comparable. The Small Vehicle still has separate delusions to remove and separate principle to reveal, therefore even what is attained must be broken. The Middle Way is not thus—how could what is attained be broken?

問：若爾，中道唯應有一實諦，不應言無諦也？

> **Question:** If so, the Middle Way should only have one real truth; it should not be called no-truth!

答：為未得者執中生惑，故須無諦。實得者有，戲論者無(云云)。

> **Answer:** For those who have not attained [it] and cling to the Middle, delusion arises; therefore no-truth is needed. For those who truly attain there is [truth]; for those engaged in idle talk there is not (and so on).
