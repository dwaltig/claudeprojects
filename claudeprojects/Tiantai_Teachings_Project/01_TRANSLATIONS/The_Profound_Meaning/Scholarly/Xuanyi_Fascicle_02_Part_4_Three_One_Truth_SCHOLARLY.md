## 五明三諦
# 5. The Three Truths Realm

---

眾經備有其義，而名出《纓珞》，《仁王》謂有諦、無諦、中道第一義諦。

> Various sūtras fully contain this meaning, but the name comes from the *Yingluo [Jing]* and *Renwang [Jing]*, which speak of: Existent Truth, Non-Existent Truth, and **Middle Way Ultimate Truth**.[^1]

今經亦有其義，〈壽量〉云：「非如非異」即中道。如即真，異即俗。

> This present sūtra also contains this meaning. The *Lifespan Chapter* says: "**Neither same nor different**"—this is the Middle Way. "Same" is truth; "different" is conventional.

---

### On Borrowing Terms Between Sūtras

問：若此經無四種因緣等名，那用其義？

> **Q:** If this sūtra does not have the names "four kinds of dependent origination," etc., why use those meanings?

答：五住、二死，名出《勝鬘》，《涅槃》不應用其義。若不用五住，則不破無明。若不用二死，則非常住。又，三佛名出《楞伽》，餘經應無三佛義。眾經皆是佛說，名乃不同，義不可壅(云云)。

> **A:** The "five dwellings" and "two deaths" come from the *Śrīmālā Sūtra*; [by that logic] the *Nirvāṇa Sūtra* should not use those meanings. But if we don't use the five dwellings, we cannot break ignorance. If we don't use the two deaths, there is no permanence. Also, the "three Buddhas" come from the *Laṅkāvatāra*; [by that logic] other sūtras should have no three Buddha meaning. **All sūtras are spoken by the Buddha; names may differ, but meanings cannot be obstructed.**

### The Five Types of Three Truths

今明三諦為三：一、明三諦。二、判麁妙。三、開麁顯妙。却前兩種二諦，以不明中道故，就五種二諦，得論中道，即有五種三諦。

> Now we clarify the Three Truths in three parts: (1) Clarifying the Three Truths, (2) Judging coarse and subtle, (3) Opening the coarse to reveal the subtle. Setting aside the first two types of Two Truths (since they do not clarify the Middle Way), based on the [remaining] five types of Two Truths, we can discuss the Middle Way—hence there are **Five Types of Three Truths**.

---

#### Type 1: Distinct-Entering-Common Three Truths (別入通三諦)

約別入通，點非有漏非無漏，三諦義成：有漏是「俗」；無漏是「真」；非有漏非無漏是「中」。當教論中，但異空而已；中無功用，不備諸法。

> In terms of Distinct-entering-Common, pointing to "neither with-outflows nor without-outflows," the Three Truths meaning is established:
> - **With-outflows** = Conventional
> - **Without-outflows** = Truth
> - **Neither with-outflows nor without-outflows** = Middle

Within this teaching, [the Middle] is only different from emptiness; the Middle has no function and **does not contain all dharmas**.

---

#### Type 2: Perfect-Entering-Common Three Truths (圓入通三諦)

圓入通三諦者，二諦不異前；點非漏非無漏具一切法，與前中異也。

> In Perfect-entering-Common, the Two Truths are not different from before; but pointing to "neither with-outflows nor without-outflows" as **containing all dharmas**—this differs from the former Middle.

---

#### Type 3: Distinct Three Truths (別三諦)

別三諦者，開彼俗為兩諦，對真為中。中，理而已(云云)。

> Distinct Three Truths: opening that conventional into two truths, contrasting truth as Middle. **The Middle is principle only.**

---

#### Type 4: Perfect-Entering-Distinct Three Truths (圓入別三諦)

圓入別三諦者，二諦不異前，點真中道具足佛法也。

> Perfect-entering-Distinct Three Truths: the Two Truths are not different from before; pointing to the true Middle Way as **fully containing Buddha-dharma**.

---

#### Type 5: Perfect Three Truths (圓三諦)

圓三諦者，非但中道具足佛法，真、俗亦然。三諦圓融，一三、三一，如《止觀》中說(云云)。

> **Perfect Three Truths:** Not only does the Middle Way fully contain Buddha-dharma, but truth and conventional also do. **The Three Truths are perfectly interfused—one is three, three is one**—as explained in the *Mohe Zhiguan*.

---

### Summary Table: Five Types of Three Truths

| Type | Teaching | Conventional | Truth | Middle |
|------|----------|--------------|-------|--------|
| 1 | Distinct-into-Common | With-outflows | Without-outflows | Neither (empty of function) |
| 2 | Perfect-into-Common | Same | Same | Neither (contains all dharmas) |
| 3 | Distinct | Opened from conventional | Truth | Principle only |
| 4 | Perfect-into-Distinct | Same | Same | Contains Buddha-dharma |
| 5 | **Perfect** | Contains all | Contains all | Contains all |

### Judging Coarse and Subtle

二判麁妙者，別、圓入通，帶通方便，故為麁；別不帶通為妙。圓入別帶別方便為麁；圓不帶方便，最妙。

> Judging coarse and subtle: Distinct-entering-Common and Perfect-entering-Common carry Common expedients—hence coarse. Distinct not carrying Common is subtle. Perfect-entering-Distinct carries Distinct expedients—hence coarse. **Perfect not carrying expedients is most subtle.**

約五味教者，乳教說三種三諦，二麁一妙。酪教但麁無妙。生蘇、熟蘇，皆具五種三諦，四麁一妙。此經唯一種三諦，即相待妙也。

> In terms of the Five Flavors: Milk teaching has three types—two coarse, one subtle. Curds teaching is only coarse. Fresh Butter and Clarified Butter both have all five types—four coarse, one subtle. **This sūtra has only one type of Three Truths—this is the Relative Wonderful.**

三、開麁顯妙，決前諸麁入一妙，三諦無所可待，是為絕待妙也。

> Opening the coarse to reveal the subtle: deciding all former coarse [teachings] enter the one subtle—the Three Truths have nothing to contrast with—**this is Absolute Wonderful**.

---

## 六、明一諦
# 6. The One Truth Realm

---

《大經》云：「所言二諦，其實是一，方便說二。如醉未吐，見日月轉，謂有轉日及不轉日。」醒人但見不轉，不見於轉。轉二為麁，不轉為妙。

> The *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "What is called 'Two Truths' is actually one; [we] expediently speak of two. **It is like a drunk who has not yet vomited, seeing the sun and moon spinning, saying there is a 'spinning sun' and a 'non-spinning sun.'**" A sober person only sees non-spinning, not spinning. **The two that spin are coarse; the non-spinning is subtle.**

三藏全是轉二，同彼醉人。諸大乘經帶轉二、說不轉一。今經正直捨方便，但說無上道，不轉一實，是故為妙。

> The Tripiṭaka entirely consists of spinning two—like that drunk person. The various Mahāyāna sūtras carry the spinning two while speaking of the non-spinning one. **This present sūtra straightforwardly abandons expedients, only teaching the unsurpassed Way—the non-spinning One Reality—hence it is subtle.**

---

### Teaching vs. Realization

《地持》明地相明義，說相似法。地實明義，說真實法。又教門方便即教道明義，說所證法即證道明義。今借用之。

> The *Daśabhūmika-sūtra-śāstra* clarifies: "Clarifying by stage-marks" means teaching approximate dharma. "Clarifying by stage-reality" means teaching true real dharma. Also: expedient teaching gates = teaching-path clarification; the dharma realized = realization-path clarification. We borrow this here.

「諸佛法久後，要當說真實」，即地實義。「道場所得法」，即是證道明義，是故妙也。

> "After a long time, the Buddhas must speak the Real"—this is the stage-reality meaning. "The Dharma attained at the Bodhi-site"—this is realization-path clarification. **Hence it is subtle.**

---

### Beyond One Truth: No-Truth

執著此實，實語是虛語，生語見故，故名為麁。融通無著是故言妙。

> Clinging to this Reality, "real words" become false words, because verbal views arise—hence called coarse. **Penetrating without attachment—hence called subtle.**

諸諦不可說者，「諸法從本來，常自寂滅相」，那得諸諦紛紜相礙？一諦尚無，諸諦安有？一一皆不可說，可說為麁，不可說為妙。

> **The truths cannot be spoken**: "All dharmas from the beginning constantly have the mark of extinction"—how could there be various truths in confused mutual obstruction? If one truth does not exist, how could various truths exist? Each and every [truth] cannot be spoken. **What can be spoken is coarse; what cannot be spoken is subtle.**

不可說亦不可說是妙，是妙亦妙，言語道斷故。

> "Cannot be spoken" also cannot be spoken—this is subtle. **"This subtle" is also subtle, because the path of words is cut off.**

---

### The Fourfold Unspeakability

若通作不可說者，生生不可說，乃至不生不生不可說。前不可說為麁，不生不生不可說為妙。若麁異妙，相待不融；麁妙不二，即絕待妙也(云云)。

> If we comprehensively make [all] unspeakable:
> - **Arising-arising** cannot be spoken
> - **Arising-non-arising** cannot be spoken
> - **Non-arising-arising** cannot be spoken
> - **Non-arising-non-arising** cannot be spoken

The former "unspeakable" is coarse; "non-arising-non-arising unspeakable" is subtle. If coarse differs from subtle, [they are] relative and not fused. **Coarse and subtle not being two—this is Absolute Wonderful.**

---

### Why Do Both Small and Great Vehicles Have "No-Truth"?

問：何故大小通論無諦？

> **Q:** Why do both great and small vehicles discuss "no-truth"?

答：《釋論》云：「不破聖人心中所得涅槃，為未得者執涅槃生戲論，如緣無生使，故破。」言無諦也。

> **A:** The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* says: "We do not break the nirvāṇa attained in the sage's mind. For those who have not attained [it] and cling to nirvāṇa, generating idle talk—like conditions producing the 'non-arising' fetter—therefore we break [it]." This is called "no-truth."

---

問：若爾，小乘得與不得俱皆被破，大乘得與不得亦俱應破。

> **Q:** If so, in the small vehicle both attained and not-attained are both broken. Should not great vehicle attained and not-attained also both be broken?

答：不例。小乘猶有別惑可除、別理可顯故，雖得須破；中道不爾，得云何破？

> **A:** Not comparable. The small vehicle still has separate delusions to remove and separate principle to reveal—hence even what is attained must be broken. **The Middle Way is not thus—what is attained, how could it be broken?**

---

問：若爾，中道唯應有一實諦，不應言無諦也？

> **Q:** If so, the Middle Way should only have One Real Truth—it should not be called "no-truth"!

答：為未得者執中生惑，故須無諦。實得者有，戲論者無(云云)。

> **A:** For those who have not attained [it] and cling to the Middle, generating delusion—therefore we need "no-truth." **For those who have truly attained, there is [truth]; for those engaged in idle talk, there is not.**

## Conclusion of Fascicle 2

## Footnotes

[^1]: The **Three Truths** (三諦) doctrine becomes one of Tiantai's signature teachings. Unlike the Two Truths of Mādhyamaka (conventional and ultimate), Tiantai posits three: (1) **Emptiness** (空諦)—the ultimate nature of all phenomena, (2) **Provisional Existence** (假諦)—the conventional designations, and (3) **Middle** (中諦)—the simultaneous affirmation of both without one-sidedness. In the Perfect Teaching, these three are "perfectly interfused" (圓融)—each contains the others.
