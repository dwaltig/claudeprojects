# The Third [Subtlety]: Practice Subtlety

---

### The Relationship of Wisdom and Practice

為二：一、通途增數行，二、約教增數行。

> This has two [parts]: (1) **Common-path increasing-number practices**, (2) **Teaching-specific increasing-number practices**.

夫行名進趣，非智不前。智解導行，非境不正。智目行足，到清涼池。

> **Practice means advancing forward—without wisdom, there is no progress.** Wisdom-understanding guides practice—without realm, practice is not correct. **Wisdom is the eyes; practice is the feet—[together they] arrive at the clear cool pond.**[^1]

而解是行本，行能成智，故行滿而智圓。智能顯理，理窮則智息。

> Understanding is the root of practice; practice can complete wisdom—hence when practice is full, wisdom is perfected. Wisdom can reveal principle; when principle is exhausted, wisdom ceases.

如此相須者，則非妙行。妙行者，一行一切行。

> **Such mutual dependence is not yet subtle practice. Subtle practice means: one practice is all practices.**

---

### Scriptural Evidence

如經：「本從無數佛，具足行諸道。」又云：「無量諸佛所，而行深妙道。」又云：「盡行諸佛所有道法。」

> As the sūtra says: "Originally from numberless Buddhas, completely practicing all paths." Also: "At [the places of] immeasurable Buddhas, practicing the deep and subtle path." Also: "Exhaustively practicing all the path-dharmas of all Buddhas."

既具、復深、又盡。具即是廣，深即是高，盡即究竟。

> Having "complete," moreover "deep," and also "exhaustive": **Complete means broad; deep means high; exhaustive means ultimate.**

---

### The Threefold Unity

此之妙行，與前境、智，一而論三，三而論一。

> This subtle practice, together with the former realm and wisdom, **is one discussed as three, three discussed as one**.

前境說如法相，法相亦具三，名祕密藏。前智是如法相解，解亦具三，如面上三目。今行是所行，如所說行，亦具三，名伊字三點。

> Former realm was explained as dharma-marks; dharma-marks also contain three, called the secret treasury. Former wisdom is understanding of dharma-marks; understanding also contains three, like three eyes on a face. **Present practice is what is practiced**; practicing as taught, it also contains three, called the **three dots of the *i* character** (伊字三點).[^2]

若三若一，皆無缺減，故稱妙行耳。

> **Whether three or one, there is no deficiency—hence called subtle practice.**

---

## 一、通途增數行
# Part 1: Common-Path Increasing-Number Practices

---

《釋論》云：「菩薩行般若時，以一法為行，攝一切行；或無量一法為行，攝一切行。或二法為行，攝一切行；或無量二法為行，攝一切行。乃至十法百法千萬億法為行，攝一切行；或無量十法百千萬億法為行，攝一切行。」

> The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* says: "When bodhisattvas practice *prajñā*, **with one dharma as practice, they encompass all practices**; or with immeasurable one-dharmas as practice, they encompass all practices. With two dharmas as practice, they encompass all practices... up to ten, a hundred, a thousand, ten thousand, a hundred million dharmas as practice—they encompass all practices."

行雖眾多，以智為本。智如導主，行若商人。智如利針，行如長線。智御行牛，車則安隱，能有所至。

> **Though practices are many, wisdom is the root.** Wisdom is like a guide-leader; practice is like merchants. **Wisdom is like a sharp needle; practice is like a long thread.** Wisdom drives the ox of practice; the cart is then stable and can arrive somewhere.

---

## 二、約教增數行
# Part 2: Teaching-Specific Increasing-Number Practices

---

### Tripiṭaka Teaching: One Practice

若三藏增數明行，如《阿含》中，佛告比丘：「當修一行，我證汝等四沙門果，謂心不放逸。若能護心不放逸行，廣演廣布，則所作已辦，能得涅槃。」

> In the Tripiṭaka's increasing-number practices: as in the *Āgamas*, the Buddha told the monks: "You should cultivate **one practice**—I guarantee you the four *śramaṇa* fruits—namely, **the mind not being heedless**. If you can guard the mind with non-heedless practice, broadly expounding and spreading it, then what is to be done is accomplished and you can attain nirvāṇa."

---

### Tripiṭaka: Two Practices

增二數明行者，《阿含》云：「阿練若比丘，當修二法為行，謂修止、修觀。」

> In increasing by twos: The *Āgamas* say: "Forest-dwelling monks should cultivate **two dharmas** as practice: cultivating **cessation** (*śamatha*) and cultivating **insight** (*vipaśyanā*)."

若修止時，即能休息諸惡，戒律威儀、諸行禁戒悉皆不失，成諸功德。若修觀時，即能觀苦，如實知之。觀苦集、苦盡、苦出要，如實知之，得盡漏，不受後有。

> When cultivating cessation, one can rest all evil; discipline, conduct, and all precepts are not lost—accomplishing all merits. When cultivating insight, one can contemplate suffering, knowing it as it truly is. Contemplating suffering's accumulation, cessation, and path of escape, knowing them as they truly are—attaining the exhaustion of outflows, not receiving further existence.

怛薩阿竭亦如是修。

> The Tathāgata also cultivated thus.

---

### Tripiṭaka: Three Practices

增三數明行者，謂戒、定、慧，此三是出世梯隥，佛法軌儀。

> In increasing by threes: **Discipline, concentration, wisdom**—these three are the ladder out of the world, the standard pattern of Buddha-dharma.

《戒經》云：「諸惡莫作，諸善奉行，自淨其意，是諸佛教。」

> The *Prātimokṣa* says: "**All evils not to be done; all goods to be practiced; self-purify one's mind—this is the teaching of all Buddhas.**"

諸惡即七支過罪輕重非違，《五部律》廣明其相。如是等惡，戒所防止。諸善者，善三業，若散若靜、前後方便、支林功德，悉是清升，故稱為善。自淨其意者，即是破諸邪倒，了知世間、出世間因果，正助法門，能消除心垢，淨諸瑕穢，豈過於慧？佛法曠海，此三攝盡。

> All evils means the seven-branch transgressions, grave and light violations—the *Five-part Vinaya* extensively clarifies their marks. Such evils are what discipline prevents. All goods means wholesome three karmas, whether scattered or concentrated, preparatory and subsequent skillful means, auxiliary merits—all are pure ascent, hence called goods. Self-purify one's mind means breaking all wrong views, understanding mundane and transcendent cause-and-effect, main and auxiliary dharma-gates—able to eliminate mental defilements, purifying all stains. What exceeds wisdom? **Buddha-dharma is a vast ocean; these three encompass it all.**

---

### Common Teaching: Increasing-Number Practices

通教增數行者，不定部帙判通教，但取三乘共學法門，指此為通耳。

> Common Teaching's increasing-number practices: Not fixing texts to determine the Common Teaching, we simply take the dharma-gates studied in common by the three vehicles and point to this as "Common."

《論》云：「菩薩行般若時，雖知諸法一相，亦能知一切法種種相；雖知諸法種種相，亦能知一切法一相。」

> The *Treatise* says: "When bodhisattvas practice *prajñā*, **though knowing all dharmas as one-mark, they can also know all dharmas' various marks; though knowing all dharmas' various marks, they can also know all dharmas as one-mark.**"

云何觀一切法一相？所謂觀一切法無相：如四大各各不相離，地中有水、火、風，但地多，以地為名...

> How does one contemplate all dharmas as one-mark? Namely, contemplating all dharmas as no-mark: like the four great elements not separating from each other—earth contains water, fire, and wind, but earth is dominant, so it is named "earth"...

是為觀一切法一相，一相無相。

> **This is contemplating all dharmas as one-mark; one-mark is no-mark.**

---

### Distinct Teaching: Increasing-Number Practices

別教增數行者。如善財入法界中說於一善知識所，各聞一法為行...乃至一百一十善知識，一一法門皆如是。

> Distinct Teaching's increasing-number practices: Like Sudhana entering the Dharma-realm, at each good teacher's place he heard one dharma as practice... up to 110 good teachers, each dharma-gate being thus.

是一一行皆破無明，入深境界。

> **Each and every practice breaks ignorance, entering deep realms.**

---

### Perfect Teaching: Increasing-Number Practices

圓教增數行者，如《文殊問經》明菩薩修一行三昧，當於靜室，結跏趺坐，繫緣法界，一念法界，一切無明顛倒永寂如空。

> Perfect Teaching's increasing-number practices: As the *Mañjuśrī-paripṛcchā Sūtra* clarifies—bodhisattvas cultivating the **One-Practice Samādhi** (一行三昧): in a quiet room, sitting cross-legged, **binding conditions to the Dharma-realm, one-thought [being] the Dharma-realm, all ignorance and confusion eternally quiescent like space**.

此之一行，即是一切無礙人，一道出生死，一切諸法中，皆以等觀入，解慧心寂然，三界無倫匹，此乃一行攝一切行。

> **This one practice is precisely the unobstructed person of all, one path exiting birth-and-death.** Among all dharmas, entering through equal contemplation—the mind of liberating wisdom silent and still, within the three realms without peer. **This is one practice encompassing all practices.**

---

### Perfect: Increasing by Ten and Beyond

增十數為行，攝一切行，謂十境界，或十觀成乘等。增百數、千萬億數、阿僧祇不可說法門為行，豈可具載？若得其意，例可解。

> Increasing by ten as practice, encompassing all practices: the **ten realms**, or the **ten contemplations completing the vehicle**, etc. Increasing by hundreds, thousands, ten thousands, a hundred million, asaṃkhya, unspeakable dharma-gates as practice—how could we exhaustively record them? **If one gets the meaning, by example one can understand.**

---

## Coarse and Subtle Judgment

然增數明行，為行不同，須判麁妙。

> In increasing-number practices, practices being different, we must judge coarse and subtle.

若三藏增數諸行，以生滅智導，但期出苦，止息化城，是故為麁。

> **Tripiṭaka increasing-number practices**: guided by arising-and-ceasing wisdom, only expecting to exit suffering, resting at the Conjured City—**hence coarse**.

通教增數諸行，體智雖巧，但導出苦，灰斷是同。

> **Common Teaching**: though body-wisdom is skillful, it only guides exiting suffering; ashes and extinction are the same [result].

別教增數諸行，智導則遠，自淺階深，而諸行隔別，事理不融，是故為麁。

> **Distinct Teaching**: wisdom-guidance is far-reaching, ascending from shallow to deep; but practices are separated, phenomena and principle not fused—**hence coarse**.

圓教增數諸行，行融智圓，是故為妙。

> **Perfect Teaching increasing-number practices**: practice is fused, wisdom is complete—**hence subtle**.

---

## Opening the Coarse

開麁論妙者，低頭舉手，積土弄砂，皆成佛道。雖說種種法，其實為一乘。諸行皆妙，無麁可待，待即絕矣。

> **Opening the coarse to discuss the subtle:** Lowering the head or raising the hand, piling earth or playing with sand—**all become the Buddha Path**. Though teaching various dharmas, actually it is for the One Vehicle. **All practices are subtle; there is no coarse to contrast—the contrast is severed.**

---

## The Five Special Practices

復次，約五數明行妙者，又為二：先、明別五行，次、明圓五行。

> Further, regarding the subtle practice of the five-number: two parts—first, Distinct five practices; next, Perfect five practices.

別者，如《涅槃》云：「五種之行，謂聖行、梵行、天行、嬰兒行、病行。」

> Distinct: as the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "**Five kinds of practice:**
> 1. **Sacred Practice** (聖行)
> 2. **Pure Practice** (梵行)
> 3. **Heavenly Practice** (天行)
> 4. **Infant Practice** (嬰兒行)
> 5. **Sick Practice** (病行)"

---

### Sacred Practice (聖行)

聖行有三：戒、定、慧。

> **Sacred Practice has three: discipline, concentration, wisdom.**

如經：「菩薩若聞大涅槃，聞已生信，作是思惟：諸佛世尊，有無上道，有大正法、大眾正行。」從此立行。

> As the sūtra says: "If a bodhisattva hears the Great Nirvāṇa and after hearing generates faith, thinking thus: 'All Buddha World-Honored Ones have the unsurpassed path, have the great true dharma, have the great assembly's true practice'—from this, practice is established."

「若聞大涅槃」即是信果，亦是信滅。「有無上道」已去，是信顯果之行。「無上道」是信慧；「有大正法」是信定；「大眾正行」是信戒。

> "Hearing the Great Nirvāṇa" is faith in the fruit, also faith in cessation. "Has the unsurpassed path" onward is faith in the practice revealing the fruit. "Unsurpassed path" is faith in wisdom; "great true dharma" is faith in concentration; "great assembly's true practice" is faith in discipline.

---

### The Ten Kinds of Discipline

《大論》亦明十種戒：

> The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* also clarifies **ten kinds of discipline**:

不破、不缺、不穿、不雜四種...

> Not-broken, not-deficient, not-holed, not-mixed [make four]...

| # | Type | Meaning |
|---|------|---------|
| 1 | Not-broken (不破) | Root precepts intact |
| 2 | Not-deficient (不缺) | No missing aspects |
| 3 | Not-holed (不穿) | No subtle violations |
| 4 | Not-mixed (不雜) | Not polluted by wrong intentions |
| 5 | Following-the-Path (隨道) | Precepts of the path |
| 6 | Non-Attachment (無著) | Precepts without grasping |
| 7 | Praised-by-the-Wise (智所讚) | Praised by sages |
| 8 | Self-Mastery (自在) | Free and unhindered |
| 9 | Following-Concentration (隨定) | Arising from samādhi |
| 10 | Fully-Complete (具足) | All *pāramitās* contained |

---

## Opening Coarse Precepts into Subtle

開麁顯妙者。他云：「《梵網》是菩薩戒。」今問：「是何等菩薩戒？」

> Opening the coarse to reveal the subtle: Others say: "The *Brahmajāla* is the bodhisattva precepts." We now ask: "Which kind of bodhisattva precepts?"

若作別、圓菩薩解者，可然。何者？三乘共眾外，別有菩薩，故別有戒。

> If understood as Distinct and Perfect bodhisattva [precepts], acceptable. Why? Outside the three-vehicle community, there are separate bodhisattvas—hence separate precepts.

開麁者，毘尼學者，即大乘學式叉。式叉即是大乘第一義光，非青、非黃、非赤白，三歸、五戒、十善、二百五十，皆是摩訶衍，豈有麁戒隔於妙戒！

> **Opening the coarse:** Those who study the Vinaya are precisely studying the Great Vehicle's *śikṣamāṇā*. *Śikṣamāṇā* is precisely the light of Great Vehicle ultimate meaning—neither blue, nor yellow, nor red, nor white. **The three refuges, five precepts, ten goods, 250 [bhikṣu rules]—all are Mahāyāna.** How could coarse precepts be separated from subtle precepts!

戒既即妙，人亦復然。「汝實我子」，即此義也。是名絕待妙戒。

> Precepts being precisely subtle, people are also thus. **"You are truly my children"**—this is that meaning. **This is called Absolute Subtle Precepts.**

## Footnotes

[^1]: The "**clear cool pond**" (清涼池) is a standard metaphor for nirvāṇa or the Buddha-realm—refreshing liberation from the burning of afflictions.

[^2]: The "**three dots of the *i* character**" (伊字三點) refers to the Sanskrit vowel *i* (इ), which in its traditional form has three elements arranged in a triangular pattern. This became a key Tiantai symbol for the three aspects (realm, wisdom, practice) being mutually containing and non-linear—not stacked vertically or spread horizontally, but interpenetrating.
