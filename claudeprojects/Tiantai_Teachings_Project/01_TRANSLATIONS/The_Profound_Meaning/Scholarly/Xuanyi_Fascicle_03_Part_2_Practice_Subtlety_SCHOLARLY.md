## ○第三、行妙
# The Third [Subtlety]: Practice Subtlety

---

○第三、行妙者，為二：一、通途增數行，二、約教增數行。

> The third, Practice Subtlety, has two: (1) common-path increasing-number practices, (2) teaching-specific increasing-number practices.

夫行名進趣，非智不前。智解導行，非境不正。智目行足，到清涼池。而解是行本，行能成智，故行滿而智圓。智能顯理，理窮則智息。如此相須者，則非妙行。妙行者，一行一切行。

> Practice means advancing; without wisdom it does not go forward. Wisdom-understanding guides practice; without realm it is not correct. Wisdom is the eyes, practice the feet, arriving at the cool clear pond. Understanding is the root of practice; practice can complete wisdom, therefore when practice is full, wisdom is perfected. Wisdom can reveal principle; when principle is exhausted, wisdom ceases. Such mutual dependence is not subtle practice. Subtle practice is one practice that is all practices.

如經：「本從無數佛，具足行諸道。」又云：「無量諸佛所，而行深妙道。」又云：「盡行諸佛所有道法。」既具、復深、又盡。具即是廣，深即是高，盡即究竟。

> As the sutra says: "Originally from numberless Buddhas, completely practicing all paths." Also it says: "At the places of immeasurable Buddhas, practicing the deep subtle path." Also it says: "Exhaustively practicing all the path-dharmas of all Buddhas." Already complete, moreover deep, and also exhaustive. Complete means broad; deep means high; exhaustive means ultimate.

此之妙行，與前境、智，一而論三，三而論一。前境說如法相，法相亦具三，名祕密藏。前智是如法相解，解亦具三，如面上三目。今行是所行，如所說行，亦具三，名伊字三點。若三若一，皆無缺減，故稱妙行耳。

> This subtle practice, together with the former realm and wisdom, is one discussed as three, and three discussed as one. The former realm was explained as dharma-marks; dharma-marks also contain three, called the secret treasury. The former wisdom is understanding of dharma-marks; understanding also contains three, like three eyes on a face. The present practice is what is practiced; practicing as spoken, it also contains three, called the three dots of the i character. Whether three or one, none are lacking; therefore it is called subtle practice.

前對境明智，今亦應對智明行。若直對一種智增數明行，則行若塵沙，說不可盡。況對諸智，各導眾行，則浩若虛空，得意亡言，不復可說。

> Previously, in contrast to realm we clarified wisdom; now we should also, in contrast to wisdom, clarify practice. If we directly, with a single kind of wisdom, use increasing-number to clarify practice, then practices would be like dust and sand, impossible to exhaust in speech. How much more when, in contrast to the various wisdoms, each leads many practices—vast as empty space—one gains the meaning and forgets the words; it can no longer be spoken.

《釋論》云：「菩薩行般若時，以一法為行，攝一切行；或無量一法為行，攝一切行。或二法為行，攝一切行；或無量二法為行，攝一切行。乃至十法百法千萬億法為行，攝一切行；或無量十法百千萬億法為行，攝一切行。」

> The *Śāstra* says: "When bodhisattvas practice prajñā, with one dharma as practice they encompass all practices; or with immeasurable one dharmas as practice they encompass all practices. With two dharmas as practice they encompass all practices; or with immeasurable two dharmas as practice they encompass all practices. Up to ten dharmas, a hundred dharmas, thousand, myriads, hundreds of millions of dharmas as practice, they encompass all practices; or with immeasurable tens, hundreds, thousands, myriads, hundreds of millions of dharmas as practice, they encompass all practices."

行雖眾多，以智為本。智如導主，行若商人。智如利針，行如長線。智御行牛，車則安隱，能有所至。用此增數諸行，為前十如諦智所導，乃至一實諦智所導。若得此意，以正智導眾行入正境中，此義唯可懸知，不可載記(云云)。

> Though practices are many, wisdom is the root. Wisdom is like a guide-master; practice is like merchants. Wisdom is like a sharp needle; practice is like a long thread. Wisdom drives the ox of practice; the cart is then secure and can arrive somewhere. Using these increasing-number practices, they are guided by the earlier Ten Suchnesses Truth wisdoms, up to the One Real Truth wisdom. If one gains this meaning and uses correct wisdom to guide the many practices into the correct realm, this meaning can only be known from afar and cannot be recorded (and so on).

二、約教增數者，若三藏增數明行，如《阿含》中，佛告比丘：「當修一行，我證汝等四沙門果，謂心不放逸。若能護心不放逸行，廣演廣布，則所作已辦，能得涅槃。」

> Second, teaching-specific increasing numbers: if in the Tripiṭaka increasing numbers clarify practice, as in the *Āgamas*, the Buddha told the monks: "You should cultivate one practice; I guarantee you the four śramaṇa fruits—namely, the mind not being heedless. If you can guard the mind with the practice of non-heedlessness, broadly expounding and spreading it, then what is to be done is accomplished and you can attain nirvāṇa."

又告比丘：「當修一行，謂他物莫取。」比丘白佛：「我已知已。」佛言：「汝云何知？」比丘白佛：「他物謂：色、聲、香、味、觸、法。」佛言：「善哉！若能不取此六，即所作已辦，能得涅槃。」所言廣演廣布者，以不放逸心，歷一切法，謂三界、六塵皆不放逸，得至涅槃。

> He also told the monks: "You should cultivate one practice, namely, do not take what belongs to others." A monk said to the Buddha: "I already know." The Buddha said: "How do you know?" The monk said: "Others' things are form, sound, smell, taste, touch, and dharmas." The Buddha said: "Good! If you can not take these six, then what is to be done is accomplished and you can attain nirvāṇa." What is meant by "broadly expounding and spreading" is that with a non-heedless mind one traverses all dharmas—namely, in the three realms and the six dusts, all are not heedless—thus one reaches nirvāṇa.

增二數明行者，《阿含》云：「阿練若比丘，當修二法為行，謂修止、修觀。若修止時，即能休息諸惡，戒律威儀、諸行禁戒悉皆不失，成諸功德。若修觀時，即能觀苦，如實知之。觀苦集、苦盡、苦出要，如實知之，得盡漏，不受後有。怛薩阿竭亦如是修。」

> In increasing by twos to clarify practice, the *Āgamas* say: "Āraṇya monks should cultivate two dharmas as practice, namely cultivating cessation and cultivating contemplation. When cultivating cessation, one can rest all evils; discipline, deportment, and all precepts of practice are not lost, accomplishing various merits. When cultivating contemplation, one can contemplate suffering and know it as it truly is. Contemplate suffering's accumulation, suffering's cessation, and suffering's essential escape, know them as they truly are; attain exhaustion of outflows and not receive further existence. The Tathāgata also cultivates thus."

增三數明行者，謂戒、定、慧，此三是出世梯隥，佛法軌儀。《戒經》云：「諸惡莫作，諸善奉行，自淨其意，是諸佛教。」諸惡即七支過罪輕重非違，《五部律》廣明其相。如是等惡，戒所防止。諸善者，善三業，若散若靜、前後方便、支林功德，悉是清升，故稱為善。自淨其意者，即是破諸邪倒，了知世間、出世間因果，正助法門，能消除心垢，淨諸瑕穢，豈過於慧？佛法曠海，此三攝盡。

> In increasing by threes to clarify practice, it is discipline, concentration, and wisdom. These three are the ladder out of the world, the norms of Buddha-dharma. The *Sīla Sūtra* says: "All evils not to be done; all goods to be practiced; self-purify one's mind—this is the teaching of all Buddhas." All evils are the seven-branch transgressions, heavy and light, violations and non-violations; the *Five-part Vinaya* extensively clarifies their marks. Such evils are what discipline prevents. All goods are the wholesome three karmas; whether scattered or still, preparatory and subsequent skillful means, auxiliary-forest merits, all are pure ascent, hence called good. Self-purify one's mind is to break all wrong inversions, understand worldly and supramundane cause and effect, correct and auxiliary dharma-gates, able to eliminate the mind's defilements and purify all stains—what surpasses wisdom? The vast ocean of Buddha-dharma is encompassed by these three.

若得此意，四、五、六、七，乃至百千萬億法為行，攝一切行亦如是，是名下智導行也。

> If one gains this meaning, then four, five, six, seven, up to hundreds, thousands, myriads, and hundreds of millions of dharmas as practice, encompassing all practices, are also like this. This is called lower wisdom guiding practice.

通教增數行者，不定部帙判通教，但取三乘共學法門，指此為通耳。今且引《釋論》增數，以示其相。

> Common Teaching increasing-number practices: not fixing texts to determine the Common Teaching, we merely take the dharma-gates studied in common by the three vehicles and point to this as "Common." For now we cite the *Śāstra* on increasing numbers to show its marks.

《論》云：「菩薩行般若時，雖知諸法一相，亦能知一切法種種相；雖知諸法種種相，亦能知一切法一相。云何觀一切法一相？所謂觀一切法無相：如四大各各不相離，地中有水、火、風，但地多，以地為名；水、火、風亦如是。」

> The *Śāstra* says: "When bodhisattvas practice prajñā, though they know all dharmas as one-mark, they can also know all dharmas' various marks; though they know all dharmas' various marks, they can also know all dharmas as one-mark. How does one contemplate all dharmas as one-mark? Namely, contemplating all dharmas as no-mark: the four great elements are not separate from each other. In earth there are water, fire, and wind; but earth is predominant, therefore it is named earth; water, fire, and wind are also thus."

今觀無此異相，若火中有三大，三大應併熱。若三大在火中，二大遂不熱，則不名火。若三大併熱，則三大捨自性，皆名為火，無復三大。若言有三大，而細不可知，此與無何異？若麁可得，則知有細；若無麁，細亦無。如是，則火中諸相不可得，一切法相亦不可得。是故一切法皆一相。此以一相破異相，復以無相破一相，無相亦自滅，如前火木然諸薪已，亦復自燒。是為觀一切法一相，一相無相。如是無量一切法悉皆一相，一相無相。

> Now contemplate that there are no such different marks: if within fire there are three great elements, the three greats should all be hot. If the three greats are within fire, the two greats then are not hot, thus it is not called fire. If the three greats are all hot, then the three greats abandon their own nature, all are called fire, and there are no longer three greats. If one says there are three greats but they are subtle and cannot be known, how is this different from there being none? If the coarse can be obtained, then one knows there is subtle; if there is no coarse, the subtle is also none. Thus, the various marks in fire are unobtainable; the marks of all dharmas are also unobtainable. Therefore all dharmas are one mark. This uses one mark to break different marks, then uses no-mark to break one mark; no-mark also extinguishes itself, like earlier the fire and wood, after burning the fuel, also burns itself. This is contemplating all dharmas as one mark; one mark is no-mark. Thus the immeasurable dharmas are all one mark; one mark is no-mark.

或二法為行，攝一切行。乃至百法千萬億法為行，攝一切行。可以意推，不復繁記。

> With two dharmas as practice, they encompass all practices. Up to a hundred dharmas, thousands, myriads, hundreds of millions of dharmas as practice, they encompass all practices. One can infer by meaning; no need to record at length.

別教增數行者。如善財入法界中說於一善知識所，各聞一法為行，或如幻三昧，或投巖赴火，算砂相黶，發菩提心等，種種一行，皆云：「佛法如海，我唯知此一法門，餘非所知。」乃至一百一十善知識，一一法門皆如是。是一一行皆破無明，入深境界。若二法、三法、百千萬億等法，亦應如是(云云)。

> Distinct Teaching increasing-number practices: like Sudhana entering the Dharma-realm, at each good teacher's place he heard one dharma as practice—such as the Illusory Samādhi, or throwing oneself from cliffs and into fire, counting sand and marking moles, arousing the bodhi mind, and so on—various single practices. All say: "The Buddha-dharma is like the sea; I only know this one dharma-gate; the rest I do not know." Up to 110 good teachers, each dharma-gate is thus. Each and every practice breaks ignorance and enters deep realms. If two dharmas, three dharmas, hundreds, thousands, myriads, and so on are taken as practice, it should also be like this (and so on).

圓教增數行者，如《文殊問經》明菩薩修一行三昧，當於靜室，結跏趺坐，繫緣法界，一念法界，一切無明顛倒永寂如空。此之一行，即是一切無礙人，一道出生死，一切諸法中，皆以等觀入，解慧心寂然，三界無倫匹，此乃一行攝一切行。

> Perfect Teaching increasing-number practices: as the *Mañjuśrī-Question Sutra* explains bodhisattvas cultivating the One-Practice Samādhi, they should be in a quiet room, sit in full lotus, bind conditions to the dharma-realm, one thought being the dharma-realm, all ignorance and invertedness eternally quiescent like space. This one practice is precisely the unobstructed person of all, one path out of birth and death. In all dharmas, all enter by equal contemplation; the mind of liberating wisdom is quiescent, within the three realms unmatched—this is one practice encompassing all practices.

增二法為行，攝一切行，所謂止、觀。增三法為行，攝一切行，謂聞、思、修，戒、定、慧。增四法為行，攝一切行，謂四念處。增五法為行，攝一切行，謂五門禪。增六法為行，攝一切行，謂六波羅蜜。增七法為行，攝一切行，謂七善法。增八法為行，攝一切行，謂八正道。增九法為行，攝一切行，謂九種大禪。增十數為行，攝一切行，謂十境界，或十觀成乘等。增百數、千萬億數、阿僧祇不可說法門為行，豈可具載？若得其意，例可解。

> Increase by two dharmas as practice, encompassing all practices, namely cessation and contemplation. Increase by three dharmas as practice, encompassing all practices, namely hearing, thinking, cultivating, and discipline, concentration, wisdom. Increase by four dharmas as practice, encompassing all practices, namely the four mindfulnesses. Increase by five dharmas as practice, encompassing all practices, namely the five gates of dhyāna. Increase by six dharmas as practice, encompassing all practices, namely the six pāramitās. Increase by seven dharmas as practice, encompassing all practices, namely the seven good dharmas. Increase by eight dharmas as practice, encompassing all practices, namely the eightfold right path. Increase by nine dharmas as practice, encompassing all practices, namely the nine kinds of great dhyāna. Increase by ten as practice, encompassing all practices, namely the ten realms, or the ten contemplations completing the vehicle, and so on. Increase by hundreds, by thousands of myriads, by asaṃkhyeyas, by unspeakable dharma-gates as practice—how could one exhaustively record them? If one gains the meaning, the rest can be understood by example.

然增數明行，為行不同，須判麁妙。若三藏增數諸行，以生滅智導，但期出苦，止息化城，是故為麁。通教增數諸行，體智雖巧，但導出苦，灰斷是同。別教增數諸行，智導則遠，自淺階深，而諸行隔別，事理不融，是故為麁。圓教增數諸行，行融智圓，是故為妙。

> In increasing-number practices, practices being different, we must judge coarse and subtle. Tripiṭaka increasing-number practices are guided by arising-and-ceasing wisdom, only expecting to exit suffering, resting at the conjured city; therefore they are coarse. Common Teaching increasing-number practices, though their embodied wisdom is skillful, only guide exit from suffering; ashes and extinction are the same. Distinct Teaching increasing-number practices are guided by far-reaching wisdom, ascending from shallow to deep; but practices are separated, phenomena and principle not fused—therefore coarse. Perfect Teaching increasing-number practices, practice is fused and wisdom is complete—therefore subtle.

今經屬圓增數，如《觀經》云：「於三七日，一心精進。」此就一法論行妙。「若行、若坐，思惟此經。」此就二法論行妙。「若聞是經，思惟修習，善行菩薩道。」此就三法論行妙。「四安樂行」，此就四法論行妙。「五品弟子」，此就五法論行妙。「六根清淨」，此就六法論行妙。如是等待麁論妙也。

> This sutra belongs to Perfect increasing-number practice. As the *Contemplation Sutra* says: "For three periods of seven days, with single-minded diligence." This discusses subtle practice by one dharma. "Whether walking or sitting, contemplate this sutra." This discusses subtle practice by two dharmas. "If one hears this sutra, contemplates and cultivates it, well practices the bodhisattva path." This discusses subtle practice by three dharmas. The "Four Peaceful Practices" discuss subtle practice by four dharmas. The "Five Grades of disciples" discuss subtle practice by five dharmas. The "Six Roots Pure" discuss subtle practice by six dharmas. Thus, waiting on the coarse to discuss the subtle.

開麁論妙者，低頭舉手，積土弄砂，皆成佛道。雖說種種法，其實為一乘。諸行皆妙，無麁可待，待即絕矣。

> Opening the coarse to discuss the subtle: lowering the head or raising the hand, piling earth or playing with sand— all become the Buddha path. Though teaching various dharmas, actually it is for the One Vehicle. All practices are subtle; there is no coarse to contrast—the contrast is severed.

復次，約五數明行妙者，又為二：先、明別五行，次、明圓五行。

> Further, regarding the subtle practice of the five-number, there are two: first, clarify the distinct five practices; second, clarify the perfect five practices.

別者，如《涅槃》云：「五種之行，謂聖行、梵行、天行、嬰兒行、病行。」

> Distinct: as the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra* says: "Five kinds of practice, namely sacred practice, pure practice, heavenly practice, infant practice, and sick practice."

聖行有三：戒、定、慧。

> Sacred practice has three: discipline, concentration, and wisdom.

如經：「菩薩若聞大涅槃，聞已生信，作是思惟：諸佛世尊，有無上道，有大正法、大眾正行。」從此立行。

> As the sutra says: "If a bodhisattva hears the Great Nirvāṇa, after hearing gives rise to faith, thinking thus: All Buddhas, World-Honored Ones, have the unsurpassed path, have the great true dharma, have the great assembly's true practice." From this, practice is established.

「若聞大涅槃」即是信果，亦是信滅。「有無上道」已去，是信顯果之行。「無上道」是信慧；「有大正法」是信定；「大眾正行」是信戒。是名信因、信道。

> "If one hears the Great Nirvāṇa" is faith in the fruit, also faith in cessation. "Has the unsurpassed path" onward is faith in the practice revealing the fruit. "Unsurpassed path" is faith in wisdom; "great true dharma" is faith in concentration; "great assembly's true practice" is faith in discipline. This is called faith in the cause and faith in the path.

自傷己身及諸眾生，破戒造罪，失人天樂及涅槃樂，即是知集；往來生死，受惡道報，即是知苦；苦、集與戒、定、慧相違，即無道；無道故，不得涅槃，則無滅。

> Grieving for oneself and all sentient beings, breaking precepts and creating offenses, losing human and heavenly joy and nirvāṇa joy—this is knowing accumulation. Coming and going in birth and death, receiving retribution in evil paths—this is knowing suffering. Suffering and accumulation are contrary to discipline, concentration, and wisdom; thus there is no path. With no path, one cannot attain nirvāṇa; therefore there is no cessation.

菩薩欲拔苦、集，而起大悲，興兩誓願；欲與道、滅而起大慈，興兩誓願。發誓願已，次則修行。思惟在家逼迫猶如牢獄，不得盡壽淨修梵行；出家閑曠，猶若虛空。即棄家捨欲，白四羯磨，持性重戒、息世譏嫌等無差別，不為愛見羅剎毀戒浮囊，如《止觀》中說。

> Bodhisattvas wish to pull out suffering and accumulation, therefore arouse great compassion and raise two vows; they wish to bestow path and cessation, therefore arouse great loving-kindness and raise two vows. After making vows, they next cultivate practice. They contemplate that life at home is oppressive like a prison, unable to cultivate pure brahma-practice for the full lifespan; leaving home is idle and open like space. Therefore they abandon home and desire, perform the four karmans, uphold the intrinsic and heavy precepts, cease worldly criticism and suspicion, with no difference, not letting the rakṣasas of love and views destroy the precepts' float-sack, as explained in *Śamatha-Vipaśyanā*.

因是持戒，具足根本業清淨戒、前後眷屬餘清淨戒、非諸惡覺覺清淨戒、護持正念念清淨戒、迴向具足無上道戒。根本者，十善性戒眾戒根本，為無漏心持，故言清淨。前後眷屬餘清淨戒者，偷蘭遮等，是前眷屬；十三等是後眷屬；餘者非律藏所出，絓諸經所制者，如方等二十四戒之流，名為餘戒也。

> Because of holding precepts, they complete the root karma pure precepts, the pre- and post-retinue remaining pure precepts, the non-evil-thoughts-thought pure precepts, the guarding right mindfulness pure precepts, and the dedicating to complete unsurpassed path precepts. The root: the ten wholesome nature precepts are the root of the precept-assemblies; held with the outflow-free mind, therefore called pure. The pre- and post-retinue remaining pure precepts: thullaccaya and the like are the former retinue; the thirteen and the like are the later retinue; the remainder are not from the Vinaya collection but are prescribed by various sutras, such as the 24 precepts of the Vaipulya type, called the remaining precepts.

此兩支屬律儀作法，受得之戒也。後三支非作法，是得法，得法時乃發斯戒也。

> These two branches belong to the vinaya-rituals and are precepts obtained by ritual. The latter three branches are not ritual; they are dharmas obtained, and at the time of obtaining the dharma, these precepts arise.

非諸惡覺覺清淨戒者，即定共也。尸羅不清淨，三昧不現前。以戒淨故，事障除，發得未來；性障除，發得根本。滅惡覺觀，名定共戒也。

> The pure precepts of non-evil-thoughts-thoughts are precisely concentration-shared. If śīla is not pure, samādhi does not appear. Because precepts are pure, the obstruction of matters is removed and future [samādhi] is attained; the obstruction of nature is removed and the root [samādhi] is attained. Extinguishing evil thought and contemplation is called the concentration-shared precepts.

護持正念念清淨戒者，即四念處。觀理正念，雖未發真，由相似念，能發真道，成道共戒，故名正念念清淨戒。

> The pure precepts of guarding right mindfulness are precisely the four mindfulnesses. Contemplating principle with right mindfulness, though true [wisdom] has not yet arisen, by similar mindfulness one can arouse the true path and complete the path-shared precepts; therefore it is called the pure precepts of right mindfulness.

復次，定共戒依定心發，屬止善義。道共戒依分別心發，屬行善義。動、不動俱是毘尼。何者？戒論防止，得定共心，不復起惡；得道共發真，永無過罪，故俱是戒也。

> Furthermore, concentration-shared precepts arise from the concentration mind and belong to the good of stopping. Path-shared precepts arise from the discriminating mind and belong to the good of practice. Moving and not moving are both vinaya. Why? In the precept treatise, they prevent and stop: attaining the concentration-shared mind, one no longer raises evil; attaining the path-shared, true arises, forever without transgression. Therefore both are precepts.

迴向具足無上道戒者，即是菩薩於諸戒中，具四弘、六度，發願要心，迴向菩提，故名大乘戒。弘誓如前說。六度者，厭惡出家，捨於所愛，即是檀；纖毫不犯，拒逆羅剎，即是尸；能檢節身心，安忍打罵，名生忍；耐八風寒熱貪恚等，名法忍；愛見不能損，即是羼提；守護於戒犯心不起，即是精進；決志持戒，不為狐疑所誑，專心不動，名為禪；明識因果，知戒是正順解脫之本，出生一切三乘聖人，非六十二見鷄狗等戒，名為般若。

> The dedicating to complete unsurpassed path precepts are precisely when bodhisattvas, among all precepts, complete the four vast vows and the six pāramitās, arouse the essential mind of vows, and dedicate to bodhi; therefore they are called Mahāyāna precepts. The great vows are as previously explained. The six pāramitās: disliking the household and leaving home, abandoning what one loves, is dāna; not violating even a hair and rejecting the rakṣasas is śīla; able to restrain body and mind and patiently endure beating and abuse is patience toward beings; enduring the eight winds, cold and heat, greed and anger, and so on is patience toward dharmas; if love and views cannot damage it, this is kṣānti; guarding so that the mind of breaking precepts does not arise is vīrya; resolutely upholding precepts, not deceived by fox-like doubts, concentrating the mind without movement is dhyāna; clearly knowing cause and effect, knowing that precepts are the correct basis in accord with liberation, giving rise to all sages of the three vehicles, not the precepts of the sixty-two views, chicken-and-dog, and so on—this is prajñā.

又別發願，要制己心。寧以此身臥於熱鐵，不以破戒受他床席。十二誓願自制其心。又更發願，願一切眾生得護持禁戒，得清淨戒，善戒，不缺戒，不析戒，大乘戒，不退戒，隨順戒，畢竟戒，具足諸波羅蜜戒。以此十願，防護眾生。菩薩一持戒心，若干願行以莊嚴戒，諸餘行心亦應如是。

> Again, they separately make vows to restrain their own minds: better to lie upon hot iron with this body than to receive another's bed and seat by breaking precepts. With twelve vows they restrain their minds. Again they further vow that all sentient beings obtain guarding of the prohibition precepts, obtain pure precepts, good precepts, not-deficient precepts, not-analyzed precepts, Mahāyāna precepts, non-retreating precepts, compliant precepts, ultimate precepts, and the complete pāramitā precepts. With these ten vows they protect sentient beings. A bodhisattva's single mind of holding precepts, with various vows and practices, adorns the precepts; the minds of all other practices should also be thus.

然護他十戒，從自行五支中出：從根本、眷屬兩支出禁戒、清淨戒、善戒。何者？篇聚作法即是禁戒。禁戒若發無作，乃名清淨，清淨即止善：而言善戒，即是行善也。

> Yet the ten precepts protecting others arise from one's own five branches: from the root and retinue two branches arise the prohibition precepts, pure precepts, and good precepts. Why? The disciplinary procedures for the collections are precisely the prohibition precepts. If the prohibition precepts give rise to the unconditioned, they are called pure; purity is stopping-good. As for the good precepts, they are practicing-good.

從非惡覺覺清淨戒，開出不缺戒。何者？雖防護七支，妄念數起，致有缺漏。若發未來禪，事行不缺；得根本禪，性行不缺。

> From the pure precepts of non-evil-thoughts-thoughts, one opens out the not-deficient precepts. Why? Though one guards the seven branches, false thoughts arise repeatedly and cause deficiencies. If one attains future dhyāna, practice in matters is not deficient; if one attains root dhyāna, practice in nature is not deficient.

從護持正念念清淨戒，開出不析戒，即道共戒也。滅色入空是析法道共；今體法入空，故名不析。又內有道共；則戒品牢固，不可破析也。

> From the pure precepts of guarding right mindfulness, one opens out the not-analyzed precepts, that is, the path-shared precepts. Extinguishing form and entering emptiness is the analyzed-dharma path-shared; now, embodying dharmas and entering emptiness, therefore it is called not-analyzed. Again, inwardly there is path-shared; thus the precept qualities are firm and cannot be broken or analyzed.

從迴向具足無上道戒，開出大乘、不退、隨順、畢竟、具足波羅蜜戒。言大乘者，菩薩持性重、譏嫌等無差別。自求佛道，性重則急；為化眾生，譏嫌則急；小乘自調，性重則急；不度他故，譏嫌則寬。菩薩具持兩種，故名大乘戒。不退者，行於非道，善巧方便，婬舍、酒家非法之處，輒以度人，而於禁戒無有退失。如醫療病，不為病所污，故名不退。隨順者，隨物機宜，隨順道理，故名隨順戒。畢竟者，竪究竟無上之法也。具足波羅蜜者，橫一切圓滿，無法不備也。

> From the dedicating to complete unsurpassed path precepts, one opens out the Mahāyāna, non-retreating, compliant, ultimate, and complete pāramitā precepts. As for "Mahāyāna": bodhisattvas uphold intrinsic and heavy [precepts] and the criticized and suspected without difference. Seeking the Buddha path for themselves, the intrinsic and heavy are urgent; to transform sentient beings, the criticized and suspected are urgent; the Lesser Vehicle self-regulates, the intrinsic and heavy are urgent; because it does not save others, the criticized and suspected are lax. Bodhisattvas uphold both kinds, therefore it is called Mahāyāna precepts. "Non-retreating": walking in non-paths with skillful expedients, at brothels, taverns, and unlawful places, they then save people, yet in the prohibition precepts there is no retreat or loss. It is like a doctor treating illness, not being tainted by the illness; therefore it is called non-retreating. "Compliant": complying with beings' capacities and complying with principle, therefore called compliant precepts. "Ultimate": vertically, the ultimate unsurpassed dharma. "Complete pāramitā": horizontally, all are complete and full; no dharma is not provided.

《大論》亦明十種戒：不破、不缺、不穿、不雜四種，即是《大經》根本支中，禁戒、清淨戒、善戒、不缺戒。《論》隨道戒，即是《大經》護持正念支中不析戒也。《論》無著戒，即是《大經》迴向支中不退戒。《論》智所讚戒，即是《大經》大乘戒。《論》自在戒，即是《大經》自在戒。《論》隨定戒，即是《大經》隨順戒。《論》具足戒，即是《大經》波羅蜜戒。《大經》明畢竟，《論》言隨定，此大同小異，於義無失。

> The *Mahāprajñāpāramitā-śāstra* also clarifies ten kinds of precepts: the four kinds not-broken, not-deficient, not-holed, not-mixed are precisely, in the Great Sutra's root branch, the prohibition precepts, pure precepts, good precepts, and not-deficient precepts. The *Śāstra's* path-following precepts are precisely, in the Great Sutra's guarding right mindfulness branch, the not-analyzed precepts. The *Śāstra's* non-attachment precepts are precisely, in the Great Sutra's dedication branch, the non-retreating precepts. The *Śāstra's* wise-praised precepts are precisely the Great Sutra's Mahāyāna precepts. The *Śāstra's* self-mastery precepts are precisely the Great Sutra's self-mastery precepts. The *Śāstra's* concentration-following precepts are precisely the Great Sutra's compliant precepts. The *Śāstra's* complete precepts are precisely the Great Sutra's pāramitā precepts. The Great Sutra clarifies ultimate; the *Śāstra* speaks of following concentration—this is largely the same with minor differences, without loss of meaning.

《涅槃》欲辨菩薩次第聖行，故具列諸戒淺深、始終、具足。善能護持，即入初不動地，不動、不退、不墮、不散，是名戒聖行。戒聖行既從始淺以至於深，今仍判其麁妙。禁、淨、善三戒屬律儀，律儀通攝眾，故定尊卑、位次緒。雖有菩薩、佛等，不別立眾，故戒法是同，但以佛菩提心為異耳。故知律儀等三戒，三藏攝。不缺是定共，根本禪是事，亦屬三藏攝，是故為麁。不析戒是體法道共，即通教攝。大乘、不退等別教攝，亦兼於通。通有出假，隨機順理，於道不退。然依真諦，不及別人，別人為妙也。隨順、畢竟、具足等，圓教攝。不起滅定現諸威儀，不捨道法現凡夫事，故名隨順。唯佛一人具淨戒，餘人皆名污戒者，故名畢竟戒。戒是法界，具一切佛法、眾生法，到尸彼岸，故名具足波羅蜜戒。《淨名》云：「其能如是，是名奉律，是名善解。」此經云：「我等長夜持佛淨戒，法王法中久修梵行，始於今日得其果報。」又，「羅睺羅密行，唯我能知之。」豈非待前諸戒皆麁，唯圓為妙也。復次持初戒如乳，中間如三味，後戒如醍醐，醍醐為妙(云云)。

> The *Nirvāṇa* wishes to distinguish the bodhisattvas' sequential sacred practice, therefore it fully lists the shallow and deep, beginning and end, and completeness of the various precepts. If one can skillfully guard and uphold them, one enters the first immovable ground—immovable, non-retreating, not falling, not scattering; this is called the sacred practice of precepts. Since the sacred practice of precepts begins shallow and reaches deep, we still judge its coarse and subtle. The prohibition, purity, and good precepts belong to vinaya; vinaya generally embraces the assemblies, therefore it determines the ranks and order of positions. Though there are bodhisattvas, Buddhas, and so on, they do not establish separate assemblies; therefore the precept dharmas are the same, only differing by the Buddha's bodhi mind. Thus the three vinaya precepts are included in the Tripiṭaka. Not-deficient is concentration-shared; root dhyāna is in matters; it is also included in the Tripiṭaka, therefore coarse. The not-analyzed precepts are embodied-dharma path-shared, thus included in the Common Teaching. The Mahāyāna and non-retreating and so on are included in the Distinct Teaching, and also partially in the Common. The Common has exit-provisional; according to capacities and accordant with principle, it does not retreat from the path. Yet it relies on the True Truth and does not reach the Distinct; the Distinct is subtle. The compliant, ultimate, complete, and so on are included in the Perfect Teaching. Without entering cessation samādhi, it manifests various deportments; without abandoning the path-dharma, it manifests ordinary affairs; therefore it is called compliant. Only the Buddha alone possesses pure precepts; the rest are all called defiled precepts; therefore it is called ultimate precepts. Precepts are the dharma-realm, containing all Buddha-dharmas and sentient-being dharmas, reaching the shore of śīla; therefore it is called the complete pāramitā precepts. The *Vimalakīrti* says: "Those who can be thus are called upholders of the Vinaya; they are called good at understanding." This sutra says: "We have long upheld the Buddha's pure precepts; long practiced brahma-practice in the Dharma-king's dharma; only today have we obtained its fruit." Also: "Rāhula's secret practice, only I can know it." Is this not waiting on the prior precepts as all coarse, and only the Perfect as subtle? Furthermore, holding the initial precepts is like milk, the middle precepts like fresh curd, the later precepts like ghee; ghee is subtle (and so on).

開麁顯妙者。他云：「《梵網》是菩薩戒。」今問：「是何等菩薩戒？」彼若答言：「是藏、通等菩薩戒」者，應別有菩薩眾。眾既不別，戒何得異？又，若別明菩薩戒，何等別是緣覺戒？今明三藏三乘無別眾，不得別有菩薩、緣覺之戒也。若作別、圓菩薩解者，可然。何者？三乘共眾外，別有菩薩，故別有戒。

> Opening the coarse to reveal the subtle: others say, "The *Brahmajāla* is the bodhisattva precepts." We now ask: "Which kind of bodhisattva precepts?" If they answer, "They are the Tripiṭaka, Common, and so on bodhisattva precepts," then there should be a separate bodhisattva assembly. Since the assembly is not separate, how could the precepts differ? Again, if separate bodhisattva precepts are clarified, then which are the separate pratyekabuddha precepts? Now we clarify that in the Tripiṭaka the three vehicles have no separate assemblies; one cannot have separate bodhisattva or pratyekabuddha precepts. If understood as distinct and perfect bodhisattva, it is acceptable. Why? Outside the three-vehicle common assembly, there are separate bodhisattvas; therefore there are separate precepts.

問：

> **Question:**

三乘眾外，別有菩薩戒者，緣覺戒云何？答：

> If outside the three-vehicle assembly there are separate bodhisattva precepts, what about pratyekabuddha precepts? **Answer:**

三乘眾外，無別緣覺，此說猶是待麁之戒耳。開麁者，毘尼學者，即大乘學式叉。式叉即是大乘第一義光，非青、非黃、非赤白，三歸、五戒、十善、二百五十，皆是摩訶衍，豈有麁戒隔於妙戒！戒既即妙，人亦復然。「汝實我子」，即此義也。是名絕待妙戒。

> Outside the three-vehicle assembly there is no separate pratyekabuddha; this statement is still precepts that wait on the coarse. Opening the coarse: those who study the Vinaya are precisely studying the Great Vehicle's śikṣā. Śikṣā is precisely the light of Great Vehicle ultimate meaning—neither blue, nor yellow, nor red, nor white. The three refuges, five precepts, ten wholesome acts, 250 [precepts]—all are Mahāyāna; how could coarse precepts be separated from subtle precepts? Precepts being precisely subtle, people are also thus. "You are truly my children"—this is that meaning. This is called absolute subtle precepts.
