## ○第二、約本明十妙
# Part Two: Ten Subtleties Explained According to the Fundamental

---

### Introduction: The Two Halves

The Ten Trace Subtleties (迹門十妙) represented the **first half** of the wish-fulfilling jewel—the Buddha's manifest teaching.

Now we turn to the Ten Fundamental Subtleties (本門十妙)—**the second half**—addressing the Buddha's eternal nature revealed in Chapter 16, "Lifespan of the Tathāgata."

## 六重本迹
# Six Meanings of Fundamental and Trace

釋本迹為六：

> Explaining Fundamental and Trace has **six meanings**:

---

### 1. Principle as Fundamental (理本)

本者理本，即是實相一究竟道；迹者，除諸法實相，其餘種種皆名為迹。

> **Fundamental means Principle-Fundamental**—this is reality-mark, the One Ultimate Path. **Trace means**: except for reality-mark of all dharmas, everything else is called trace.

---

### 2. Principle-and-Event as Fundamental (理事本)

又理之與事，皆名為本；說理說事，皆名教迹也。

> Moreover, **both principle and event are called Fundamental**; **explaining principle and explaining event are called Teaching-Trace**.

---

### 3. Teaching as Fundamental (教本)

又理事之教，皆名為本；稟教修行，名為迹，如人依處，則有行跡，尋跡得處也。

> Moreover, **teaching of principle-and-event is Fundamental**; **receiving teaching and practicing is Trace**—like a person depending on a place leaves footprints; following tracks, one finds the place.

---

### 4. Body as Fundamental (體本)

又行能證體，體為本；依體起用，用為迹。

> Moreover, **practice can realize the Body; Body is Fundamental**. **Depending on Body to activate Function; Function is Trace.**

---

### 5. Real-Attainment as Fundamental (實得本)

又實得體用，名為本；權施體用，名為迹。

> Moreover, **actually attaining Body-and-Function is Fundamental**; **provisionally bestowing Body-and-Function is Trace**.

---

### 6. Today-and-Already as Fundamental (今已本)

又今日所顯者為本；先來已說者為迹。

> Moreover, **what is revealed today is Fundamental**; **what was already spoken before is Trace**.

約此六義，以明本迹也。

> According to these six meanings, we clarify Fundamental and Trace.

## ○一、略釋十意 — Brief Explanation

---

### 1. Fundamental Cause Subtlety (本因妙)

本因妙者，本初發菩提心，行菩薩道所修因也。

> **Fundamental Cause Subtlety**: The original initial arising of bodhicitta, the cause cultivated through practicing the bodhisattva path.

若十六王子在大通佛時弘經結緣，皆是中間所作，非本因也。

> If the sixteen princes at Great-Penetration Buddha's time propagated the sūtra and established connections—**all this is intermediate activity, not Fundamental Cause**.

文云：「我以佛眼觀彼久遠，猶若今也。」唯佛能知如此久遠，皆是迹因，非本因也。

> The text says: "**With Buddha-eye I observe that distant past as if it were today.**" Only Buddha can know such remoteness—all these are **Trace Causes, not Fundamental Cause**.

若留中間之因，於後難信，是故《法華》拂迹除疑...過是已前所行道者，名之為本，即是本因妙也。

> If we retained the intermediate causes, later [practitioners] would find it hard to believe. Hence the *Lotus* **brushes away traces to remove doubt**... Before all that, what was practiced—this is called Fundamental, which is **Fundamental Cause Subtlety**.

---

### 2. Fundamental Fruit Subtlety (本果妙)

本初所行圓妙之因，契得究竟常、樂、我、淨，乃是本果。

> The originally first practiced perfect-subtle cause, **contracting ultimate Permanence, Bliss, Self, and Purity**—this is **Fundamental Fruit**.

不取寂滅道場，舍那成佛，為本果也。

> We **do not take the bodhi-tree site where Vairocana became Buddha as Fundamental Fruit**.

但取成佛已來，甚大久遠，初證之果，名本果妙也。

> We only take **"since becoming Buddha, immeasurably long ago"—the originally attained fruit**—as **Fundamental Fruit Subtlety**.

---

### 3. Fundamental Land Subtlety (本國土妙)

本既成果，必有依國...文云：「自從是來，我常在此娑婆世界說法教化。」

> Having achieved Fundamental Fruit, there must be a land to dwell in... The text says: "**Since then, I have always been in this Sahā world expounding Dharma and teaching.**"

按此文者，實非今日迹中娑婆，亦非中間權迹處所，乃是本之娑婆，即本土妙也。

> According to this text, it's really **not today's Trace-Sahā, nor the intermediate expedient-trace location**—it is **Fundamental Sahā**, which is **Fundamental Land Subtlety**.

---

### 4. Fundamental Resonance Subtlety (本感應妙)

既已成果，即有本時所證二十五三昧，慈悲誓願，機感相關，能即寂而照，故言本感應也。

> Having achieved Fruit, there are **the twenty-five samādhis realized at that original time**, compassion and vows, machine and response mutually connected, **able to be quiescent yet illuminating**—hence Fundamental Resonance.

---

### 5-10. Remaining Fundamental Subtleties

| Subtlety | Content |
|----------|---------|
| **Supernatural Powers** | Original powers with neutral transformation-upon-transformation dhyāna |
| **Dharma-Exposition** | Original turning of the Dharma-wheel |
| **Retinue** | Original disciples—"those from below are my children" |
| **Nirvāṇa** | Original extinction/non-extinction |
| **Lifespan** | Original limitless lifespan |
| **Benefits** | Original benefiting with karma-, vow-, power-, response-born |

---

## 本迹雖殊，不思議一
# Fundamental and Trace Though Different, Are Inconceivably One

This refrain appears throughout Fascicle 7:

> "**Fundamental and Trace, though different, are inconceivably one.**"

The point is not to reject the Trace but to understand that:
1. The Trace arises from the Fundamental
2. By following the Trace, we reach the Fundamental
3. Ultimately they are non-dual

---

## Footnotes

[^1]: The **Ten Fundamental Subtleties** parallel the Ten Trace Subtleties but address the Buddha's eternal reality rather than his manifest teaching. The key structural shift: Trace Subtleties 1-5 (境智行位三法) deal with cause; here **Cause** is condensed into one subtlety, while **Nirvāṇa** and **Lifespan** are added as separate subtleties.
