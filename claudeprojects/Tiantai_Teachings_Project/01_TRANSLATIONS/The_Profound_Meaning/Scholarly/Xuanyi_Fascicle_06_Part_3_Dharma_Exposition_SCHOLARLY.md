○第八說法妙者，諸法不可示，言辭相寂滅；有因緣故，亦可說示。前藥、珠二身，先以定動，今毒天二鼓，後以慧拔，演說一乘，無三差別，皆悉到於一切智地。其所說法，皆實不虛，是故次說法妙。即為六意：一、釋法名。二、分大小。三、對緣同異。四、判所詮。五、明麁妙。六、明觀心。
> Eighth, clarifying the Subtlety of Dharma-Exposition: dharmas cannot be shown; the mark of words is quiescent. Because of causes and conditions, they can also be spoken and shown. Previously the two bodies of medicine and jewel, first with concentration stirring; now the two drums of poison and heaven, afterward with wisdom extracting, expounding the One Vehicle with no threefold distinction, all reaching the ground of all-knowledge. The dharmas spoken are all real and not empty; therefore next we clarify Dharma-Exposition Subtlety. This has six intents: (1) explain the dharma name; (2) distinguish great and small; (3) sameness and difference in relation to conditions; (4) determine what is expressed; (5) clarify coarse and subtle; (6) clarify contemplation of mind.

釋法名者，三世佛法雖多無量，十二部經收罄無不盡。先出達摩欝多羅，有七種分別：體一、相二、制名三、定名四、差別五、相攝六、料簡七。
> Explaining the dharma name: though the Buddha-dharma of the three times is immeasurably many, the twelve divisions of sutras gather it completely, leaving nothing out. First Dharmottara set forth seven kinds of distinctions: body one, marks two, setting names three, fixed names four, distinctions five, mutual inclusion six, discrimination seven.

體一者，經以名味章句為體，經無不然，故體一也。
> As for body being one: the sutra takes name, meaning, and phrases as its body; no sutra is not so; therefore body is one.

相二者，長行直說，有作偈讚頌，兩種相別。何者？以人情喜樂不同，有好質言、有好美語，故相別有二也。
> As for marks being two: there is direct exposition in prose and there are verses of praise, two kinds of marks differ. Why? Because people's preferences for joy differ: some like plain speech, some like elegant language; therefore the marks differ in two.

制名三者，脩多羅、祇夜、伽陀，三部就字句為名，不就所表。授記等八部，不就所表，又不就字句，從事立稱。方廣一部，名從所表。何者？脩多羅等三部，直說法相，可即名以顯所表。如苦集滅道，依名即顯所表，故就名以為名也。授記等經，所表之法，不可但以言說，要寄事方乃得顯。如授記經，從事為名，止明行因得果道理，理託事彰，事以言辨。如《法華》中，與聲聞授記，彰一切皆當得成佛。寄授記以彰所顯，故名授記經。無問自說經者，聖人說法皆待請問，然亦為眾生作不請之師，故無問自說。又佛法難知，人無能問，若不自說，眾則不知。為說不說，又復不知為說何法，故無問自說，乃所以彰所說。甚深唯證，是以寄無問自說，以彰所顯也。因緣經者，欲明戒法，必因犯彰過，過相彰現方得立制，此亦託因緣以明所顯也。譬喻經者，法相微隱，要假近以喻遠，故以言借況，寄況以彰理也。本事、本生經者，本事說他事，本生說自生，因現事以說往事，託本生以彰所表，名本事經。託本生以彰所行，名本生經也。未曾有經者，說希奇事，由來未有者，未曾有也。示法有大力，有大利益，託未曾有事，以彰所表也。論義經者，諸部中言義隱覆，往復分別得明所顯，寄論義以明理也。故授記等八經，從事立稱。方廣一部從所表為名者，方廣之理，雖以名說，而妙出名言。雖寄事以彰，然不可如事而取，故不就名不就事，就所表以為名也。
> As for the three of setting names: sutra, geya, and gatha - these three divisions take words and phrases as the name, not what is expressed. The eight divisions such as prediction do not take what is expressed, and also do not take words and phrases, but establish the name from events. The one division of vaipulya takes its name from what is expressed. Why? The three divisions such as sutra directly speak dharma-marks, and one can use the name to reveal what is expressed. For example, suffering, collection, cessation, and path: by the name one reveals what is expressed; therefore it is named by the name. For the divisions such as prediction, the dharma that is expressed cannot be revealed merely by words; it must rely on events and only then can it be revealed. For the prediction sutra, it is named from events; it only clarifies the principle of practice-cause and result-fruit. The principle is manifested by relying on events, and events are distinguished by words. As in the Lotus, giving predictions to sravakas, revealing that all will attain Buddhahood: it relies on prediction to reveal what is expressed, therefore it is named the Prediction Sutra. The unasked self-speaking sutra: sages speak the dharma waiting for questions, yet they also act as uninvited teachers for beings; therefore it is unasked self-speaking. Also the Buddha-dharma is hard to know; people have no ability to ask; if he does not speak of himself, the assembly will not know. If he does not speak, they again do not know what dharma is to be spoken; therefore unasked self-speaking is precisely to reveal what is spoken. The profound is only realized; therefore it relies on unasked self-speaking to reveal what is expressed. The causal-conditions sutra: to clarify precepts, one must, because of offenses, reveal faults; only when faults are manifested can regulations be established; this also relies on causal conditions to clarify what is expressed. The parable sutra: dharma-marks are subtle and hidden; one must borrow the near to illustrate the far; therefore it borrows words and metaphors, relying on metaphors to reveal the principle. The events and births sutras: the events sutra speaks of others' events, the births sutra speaks of one's own births; because of present events one speaks of past events; relying on births to reveal what is expressed, it is named the Events Sutra. Relying on births to reveal what is practiced, it is named the Births Sutra. The never-before sutra speaks of marvelous events; those never before are never-before. It shows the dharma has great power and great benefit, relying on never-before events to reveal what is expressed. The discussing-meanings sutra: in the divisions, meaning is hidden; through back-and-forth distinctions one clarifies what is expressed, relying on discussion of meanings to reveal the principle. Therefore the eight sutras such as prediction are named from events. The one division of vaipulya is named from what is expressed: the principle of vaipulya, though spoken by name, wondrously transcends name and language. Though relying on events to manifest, it cannot be taken as events; therefore it is not named by name and not by events, but by what is expressed.

定名有四，脩多羅名線經。經體是名字，而名從況喻。祇夜、偈陀，當體為名。授記、無問自說、論義等三經，體事合目。自餘從事也。
> Fixed names are four: sutra is named thread-sutra. The body of the sutra is name and word, and the name comes from analogy. Geya and gatha take their own substance as the name. The three sutras - prediction, unasked self-speaking, and discussing meanings - combine substance and event as the name. The rest are named from events.

差別者，脩多羅有九種。經云：從如是至奉行，一切名脩多羅。是則脩多羅名通而體總，皆名為經，故名通。就文字經體分為十二部，故體總也。
> As for distinctions: sutra has nine kinds. The sutra says: from "Thus" to "respectfully practiced," all are named sutra. Thus the name sutra is general and its body is general; all are named sutra, therefore it is called general. By the textual body the sutra is divided into twelve divisions, therefore the body is general.

第二、就總脩多羅中，隨事分出十一部，即對十一部，餘直說法相者，是別相脩多羅。
> Second, within the general sutra, according to events one separates eleven divisions; corresponding to the eleven divisions, the remainder that directly speaks dharma-marks is the specific sutra.

三者、論義經，解釋十一部經，是則十一部為經本。當知論所解釋，前十一部皆是脩多羅。又《雜心》中〈脩多羅品〉，亦對論以經為脩多羅。又如婆脩槃馱解提婆〈百論〉，論為經本，亦名論為脩多羅。又經云：除脩多羅，餘四句偈以為偈經。即對四句偈經，餘長行說者是脩多羅。又云：祇夜名偈頌脩多羅。即對祇夜頌偈，所頌即是脩多羅也。又如分別三藏，以敷置理教為脩多羅，對別毘尼、阿毘曇也。又如經說，從佛出十二部經，從十二部經出脩多羅。對十二別教，以通教為脩多羅，是九中、初二偈亦是也。
> Third, the discussing-meanings sutra explains the eleven divisions of sutras; thus the eleven divisions are the basis of the sutra. One should know that what the treatise explains - the prior eleven divisions - are all sutra. Also in the Zaxin, in the "Sutra Chapter", it likewise contrasts treatise and takes the sutra as sutra. Also, like Vasubandhu explaining Deva's Hundred Treatise, the treatise is the basis of the sutra, and the treatise is also named sutra. Also the sutra says: apart from sutra, the remaining four-line verses are named the verse sutra. In contrast to the four-line verse sutra, the remaining long prose is sutra. It also says: geya is named verse-recitation sutra; in contrast to the geya verses, what is recited is sutra. Also, like the division of the three baskets: taking the laid-out principle teaching as sutra, in contrast to the separate Vinaya and Abhidharma. Also, as the sutra says, from the Buddha arise twelve divisions of sutras, and from the twelve divisions arise sutra. In contrast to the twelve separate teachings, the common teaching is called sutra; among the nine, the first two verses are also so.

偈陀者，有四種。如言《法華》有阿閦婆等偈，《涅槃》二萬五千偈。是則偈經，復是通總。若四句為偈，一字一句，得名為經。非一字一句，皆名為偈。但以聖言巧妙，章句成就，數句為偈，故通得名偈。二、除脩多羅餘四句為偈。三、偈中重頌者，名祇夜，當知不重頌偈，名為偈經。四、如脩多羅通總，隨事剋分，別為異部，以直說為脩多羅。當知偈中亦隨事剋分，若授記因緣等，別為異部，以不隨事，直爾偈說，名為偈經。
> Gatha has four kinds. For example, the Lotus has verses like those of Aksobhya, and the Nirvana has twenty-five thousand verses. Thus the verse sutra is again general. If four lines are a verse, one character per line is named a sutra. If not one character per line, all are named verse. But because the holy words are skillful and wondrous, phrases are completed; several lines make a verse, thus generally named verse. Second, apart from sutra, the remaining four-line verse is verse. Third, within verse, the repeated recitation is called geya; one should know that non-repeated verse is called the gatha sutra. Fourth, like sutra is general but divided by events into separate divisions, with direct exposition as sutra; one should know that within verse it is also divided by events: if prediction, causal conditions, and so on, it becomes separate divisions; if it does not follow events and is simply verse, it is named gatha sutra.

祇夜者，名為重頌。頌有三種：一、頌意。二、頌事。三、頌言。頌意者，頌聖意所念法相及事。若頌心所念法相，則名偈陀經。若頌心所念授記等事，則隨事別為異經。頌事，謂授記等事，亦隨所頌事，別為異經。頌言者，若頌隨事之言，隨事別為異經。若頌直說脩多羅者，名為重頌祇夜經也。
> Geya is called repeated recitation. Recitation has three kinds: (1) reciting meaning, (2) reciting events, (3) reciting words. Reciting meaning means reciting the dharma-marks and events the sage intends. If one recites the intended dharma-marks, it is named the gatha sutra. If one recites intended events such as predictions, then according to events it becomes another division. Reciting events means prediction events and so on; likewise according to the recited events, it becomes another division. Reciting words: if one recites words that follow events, then according to events it becomes another division. If one recites the direct-spoken sutra, it is called the repeated-recitation geya sutra.

授記者，果為心期名記，聖言說與名授。授記有二種：若與諸菩薩授佛記莂，是大乘中授記。若記近因、近果，是小乘中記也。
> Prediction: the fruit is the wish of the mind, called prediction; the sage's words bestowing it are called granting. Predictions have two kinds: if granting Buddha-prediction to bodhisattvas, this is prediction in Mahayana. If predicting near cause and near fruit, this is prediction in the small vehicle.

無問自說有二種：一、理深意遠，人無能問。二、非不可問，但聽者宜聞，佛為不請之師，不請之師不待問自說也。
> Unasked self-speaking has two kinds: (1) the principle is deep and the intent far, and people cannot ask; (2) it is not that it cannot be asked, but it is fitting for hearers to hear; the Buddha acts as an uninvited teacher, and an uninvited teacher does not wait for questions but speaks of himself.

方廣有二種：一、語廣。二、理廣。
> Vaipulya has two kinds: breadth of language, breadth of principle.

相攝者，就脩多羅中出十一部。若偈與直說，相對言之，脩多羅中得出九部，但無二偈。偈陀中得出十部，但無直說脩多羅也。祇夜中得出九部，無脩多羅，亦無偈經也。
> Mutual inclusion: within sutra one derives eleven divisions. If verses and direct exposition are spoken in contrast, from sutra one can derive nine divisions, lacking only the two verse divisions. From gatha one can derive ten divisions, lacking only direct-exposition sutra. From geya one can derive nine divisions, lacking sutra and also lacking gatha.

料簡有無(云云)。
> Discrimination of presence and absence (and so on).

釋法名者，上起教中已說。今標名互有不同，翻譯多異。今依《大智論》標名者：一、脩多羅，此云法本，亦云契經，亦線經。二、祇夜，此云重頌，以偈頌脩多羅也。三、和伽羅那，此云授記。四、伽陀，此云不重頌，亦略言偈耳。四句為頌，如此間詩頌也。五、優陀那，此云無問自說。六、尼陀那，此云因緣。七、阿波陀那，此云譬喻。八、伊帝目多伽，此云如是語，亦云本事。九、闍陀伽，此云本生。十、毘佛略，此云方廣。十一、阿浮陀達摩，此云未曾有。十二、優波提舍，此云論議。
> Explaining the dharma name: above in the teaching it was already discussed. Now the labels differ from one another, and translations are many and different. Now, according to the Great Treatise, the labels are: (1) sutra, here called dharma-root, also called contract-sutra, also thread-sutra. (2) geya, here called repeated recitation, using verses to recite the sutra. (3) vyakarana, here called prediction. (4) gatha, here called non-repeated recitation, also abbreviated as verse; four lines are a recitation, like the poems and odes here. (5) udana, here called unasked self-speaking. (6) nidana, here called causal conditions. (7) avadana, here called parables. (8) itivrttaka, here called thus-spoken, also called events. (9) jataka, here called births. (10) vaipulya, here called broad. (11) adbhutadharma, here called never-before. (12) upadesa, here called discussion.

部者，部別各有類從也。經者，外國云脩多羅，此云線經。線能貫穿，經能經緯，言能持法，如線如經。然《阿毘曇雜心》中，說脩多羅五義者，乃是彼論師解義，非翻名也。世俗亦對緯名經，而訓經為常。如物經亘始終，始終時別，而物無改異，不改異故，名之為常。
> Division means that each division has its own class. Sutra: in foreign lands it is called sutra; here it is called thread-sutra. A thread can string together; a sutra can warp and weave. Words can hold the dharma, like thread and like warp. Yet in the Abhidharma Zaxin, when it explains five meanings of sutra, that is the commentators explaining meaning, not a translation of the name. In common usage, it also contrasts warp and calls it sutra, and glosses sutra as constant. Like a thing spanning beginning to end: beginning and end are times that differ, yet the thing does not change; because it does not change it is called constant.

脩多羅者，諸經中直說者，謂四《阿含》，及二百五十戒，出三藏外諸摩訶衍經直說者，皆名脩多羅也。
> Sutra: among the sutras, those that directly speak are the four Agamas, and the two hundred fifty precepts, and the Mahayana sutras outside the three baskets that directly speak; all are called sutra.

祇夜者，諸經中偈，四、五、七、九言句，少多不定，重頌上者，皆名祇夜也。
> Geya: in the sutras, verses of four, five, seven, or nine-word lines, few or many not fixed, those that repeat what is above are all called geya.

和伽羅那者，說三乘、六趣、九道劫數，當得作佛。若後爾所歲，當得聲聞、支佛。後爾所歲，當受六趣報，皆名授記。夫授記法，面門放五色光，從上二牙出，照三惡道。下二牙出，照人天。光中演說，無常無我，安隱涅槃。遇光聞法者，三途中身心安樂，人中癃殘者差，六欲天厭患欲樂，色天厭禪樂。光照十方，遍作佛事，還遶七匝，從佛足下入，是記地獄道。[A1]𨄔入、髀入、臍入、胸入、口入、肩間入、頂入者，是記佛道。《論》不見記脩羅光，當是開鬼道出脩羅，從容在於髀臍之間耳。
> Vyakarana: it speaks of the three vehicles, six destinies, nine paths, and kalpa numbers, saying when one will become Buddha. If after so many years one will become a sravaka or a pratyekabuddha; after so many years one will receive retribution in the six destinies; all are called prediction. As for the method of prediction: from the face it emits five-colored light; from the upper two teeth it comes out, illuminating the three evil paths; from the lower two teeth it comes out, illuminating humans and heavens. Within the light it expounds impermanence and no-self, peaceful nirvana. Those who encounter the light and hear the dharma have bodily and mental ease in the three paths; the crippled among humans are cured; the six desire heavens tire of desire-pleasure; the form heavens tire of dhyana-pleasure. The light illuminates the ten directions, universally performs Buddha-matters, returns circling seven times, and enters from below the Buddha's feet; this predicts the hell path. [A1] entering at the ankle, thigh, navel, chest, mouth, between the shoulders, and the crown predicts the Buddha path. The Treatise does not see prediction light for asuras; it should be that opening the ghost path produces asuras, calmly in the area between the thigh and navel.

    [A1] 𨄔【CB】，𬧅【大】
> [A1] 𨄔 [CB], 𬧅 [Da]

伽陀者，一切四言、五言、七、九等偈，不重頌者，皆名伽陀也。
> Gatha: all four-, five-, seven-, nine-word verses that do not repeat are all called gatha.

優陀那者，有法佛必應說，而無有問者，佛略開問端。如佛在舍婆提毘舍佉堂上，陰地經行，自說優陀那。所謂無我、無我所，是事善哉！是名優陀那。又如般若中，諸天子讚須菩提所說，善哉！善哉！希有世尊，難有世尊，是名優陀那。乃至佛滅後，諸弟子抄集要偈，諸無常偈作〈無常品〉，乃至〈婆羅門品〉，皆名優陀那也。
> Udana: when there is a dharma the Buddha must speak but there is no one to ask, the Buddha slightly opens the question. For example, when the Buddha was in Sravasti in Visakha's hall, he walked in the shaded ground and spoke udana himself. Namely, no-self, no-self-of - this matter is good indeed! This is called udana. Also as in the Prajna, the sons of the gods praised what Subhuti spoke: good indeed! good indeed! rare World-Honored One, hard-to-have World-Honored One - this is called udana. And after the Buddha's nirvana, disciples copied and gathered essential verses; the various impermanence verses made the Impermanence Chapter, up to the Brahmin Chapter - all are called udana.

尼陀那者，說諸佛本起因緣，佛何因緣說此事？脩多羅中，有人問故為說是事；毘尼中，有人犯是事故結是戒。一切佛語緣起事，皆名尼陀那。
> Nidana: it speaks of the original causal conditions of all Buddhas; for what causal conditions did the Buddha speak this matter? In the sutras, because someone asked, he spoke this matter; in the Vinaya, because someone violated, he established this precept. All Buddha-words about causal-conditions matters are called nidana.

阿波陀那者，與世間相似，柔軟淺語。如《中阿含》長譬喻，《長阿含》大譬喻，億耳、二十億耳譬喻等，無量譬喻皆名阿波陀那。
> Avadana: similar to worldly matters, with gentle and shallow language. For example, the long parables of the Madhyama-agama, the great parables of the Dirgha-agama, the parables of Yier and of twenty-billion-ear, and so on - immeasurable parables are all called avadana.

伊帝目多伽有二種：一者、結句。言我先許說者，今已說竟。二者、更有經，名一目多伽。有人言：因多伽目多伽，名出三藏及摩訶衍，何等是？如淨飯王強逼千釋令出家，佛選堪得道者五百人，將往舍婆提，令離親屬。身子、目連教化，初中後夜，專精不睡，以夜為長。後得道還本國，從迦毘羅婆林五十里入城乞食，覺道路為長。時有師子，來禮佛足，為三因緣說偈(云云)，說此三事本因緣，故名一目多伽也。
> Itivrttaka has two kinds: first, a concluding sentence, saying what I previously promised to say has now been said. Second, there is another sutra called Yi-mu-duo-jia. Some say: because of itivrttaka and itivrttaka, the name appears in the three baskets and Mahayana; what is it? For example, King Suddhodana strongly compelled a thousand Shakyas to leave home; the Buddha selected five hundred who were fit to attain the Way and led them to Sravasti, making them leave their relatives. Sariputra and Maudgalyayana taught them; throughout the first, middle, and later night, they were diligent and did not sleep, taking the night as long. Later, after attaining the Way, they returned to their own country and entered the city to beg from the Kapilavastu grove fifty li away, feeling the road was long. At that time a lion came to pay homage to the Buddha's feet and, for three causal conditions, spoke a verse (and so on). Speaking these three matters of original causal conditions, therefore it is called Yi-mu-duo-jia.

闍陀伽者，說菩薩本曾為師子，受獼猴寄，攫脇肉貿猴子。於病世作赤目魚，施諸病者。或作飛鳥，救於泫溺，如是等無量本生，多有所濟，皆名闍陀伽也。
> Jataka: it speaks of the bodhisattva formerly being a lion, receiving a monkey's trust, and tearing his flank flesh to exchange for the monkey. In an age of sickness he became a red-eyed fish, giving to the sick. Or he became a flying bird, rescuing those drowning. Thus are innumerable births, with much benefiting; all are called jataka.

毘佛略者，所謂《摩訶衍般若經》、《六波羅蜜經》、《華首》、《法華》、《佛本起》、《因緣雲》、《法雲》、《大雲》，如是等無量諸經，為得阿耨三菩提故，說此毘佛略也。
> Vaipulya: namely the Mahayanaprajna Sutra, Six Paramitas Sutra, Huashou, Lotus, Buddha's Original Arising, Causal-Conditions Cloud, Dharma Cloud, Great Cloud - such immeasurable sutras; for attaining anuttara-samyak-sambodhi, they speak this vaipulya.

阿浮陀達摩者，如佛現種種神力，眾生怪未曾有。放光動地，種種異相，皆名阿浮陀達摩也。
> Adbhutadharma: such as the Buddha manifesting various supernatural powers, beings marveling at what is never before; emitting light and moving the earth, various unusual marks - these are all called adbhutadharma.

優波提舍者，答諸問者，釋其所以，廣說諸義，如是等問答解義，皆名優波提舍也。佛自說論義經、迦栴延所解，乃至像法凡夫人如法說者，亦名優波提舍經也。
> Upadesa: answering various questions, explaining the reasons, broadly expounding various meanings; such questions and answers that explain meanings are all called upadesa. Sutras where the Buddha himself speaks and discusses meanings, what Katyayana explains, and even ordinary people in the Dharma-ending age who speak according to the Dharma are also called upadesa sutras.

二、明分法大小者，此經指九部為入大之本，則九部是小，三部是大，蓋別語耳。通而為言，小亦有記莂六道因果。又《阿含》中亦授彌勒當作佛記，豈非授記經？亦有自唱善哉！無問而說。聲聞經中，以法空為大空，故《成論》中云：「正欲明三藏中實義。」實義者空，是《阿毘曇》所不申，而《成論》申於空。空即廣經。當知小乘，通具十二部也。故《涅槃》云：「先雖得聞十二部經，但聞名字，不聞其義。今因《涅槃》得聞其義。」又云：「先雖得聞十二部經，我意猶謂故不如是《大涅槃經》。」《大品》亦云：「魔作比丘，為菩薩說聲聞十二部經。」有經言：「大小乘各具十二部。若信六部通大小乘，不信六部互不相通。」按此者，即是大小俱有十二部也。但是小乘中說，非大乘之義。故別讓三存九。何者？小乘灰斷，無如意珠身，故無廣經。假令以法空為廣說之文，小乘根鈍說必假緣，無天鼓任鳴，少無問自說，雖有授記，記作佛少。又《涅槃》第七云：「九部中，不明佛性，是人無罪。」例此而言，十二部中不明佛性，是人有罪。有人言：大乘九部，除因緣、譬喻、論義，大乘人根利，不假此三。斯亦別論。通語大乘，何得無此三經耶？有經言：「小乘但讓廣經一部，有十一部。」無方廣者，大乘說如來是常，一切眾生皆有佛性。正理為方，包富為廣。又理融無二，亦名為等。聲聞中所無，但十一部耳。若言小乘定有九，不應復有十一部；既取十一，亦通有十二。為緣別說，或讓三、或讓一，以判大小乘(云云)。
> Second, clarifying the division of dharma into great and small: this sutra points to nine divisions as the basis for entering the great; thus nine divisions are small and three divisions are great - this is only a separate way of speaking. Generally speaking, the small also has predictions of causes and effects in the six paths. Also in the Agamas it predicts Maitreya will become Buddha - how is that not a prediction sutra? There is also self-praising "good indeed!" and unasked self-speaking. In the sravaka sutras, taking dharma-emptiness as the great emptiness, therefore the Cheng Lun says: "It is precisely to clarify the real meaning in the three baskets." The real meaning is emptiness; this is not stated in the Abhidharma but is stated in the Cheng Lun. Emptiness is the broad sutra. One should know that the small vehicle also comprehensively has the twelve divisions. Therefore the Nirvana says: "Previously, though they heard the twelve divisions, they only heard the names and did not hear their meaning; now because of the Nirvana they hear the meaning." It also says: "Previously, though I heard the twelve divisions, my mind still thought it was not like this Mahaparinirvana Sutra." The Mahaprajna also says: "Mara became a bhiksu and spoke the sravaka twelve divisions for bodhisattvas." A sutra says: "Both the great and small vehicles each possess the twelve divisions. If you believe six divisions are common to great and small, you do not believe that six divisions mutually do not communicate." By this, it is that great and small both have twelve divisions. But in the small vehicle they are spoken, not with the Mahayana meaning. Therefore it separately yields three and retains nine. Why? The small vehicle is ashes-and-cutting, without the wish-fulfilling-jewel body, therefore without broad sutra. Even if one takes dharma-emptiness as the text of broad exposition, small-vehicle roots are dull; its speaking must rely on conditions; there is no heavenly drum sounding on its own; there is little unasked self-speaking; though there are predictions, few predict Buddhahood. Also the Nirvana (fascicle seven) says: "Within the nine divisions, not clarifying Buddha-nature, such a person is without fault." By this analogy, within the twelve divisions, not clarifying Buddha-nature, such a person has fault. Some say: in Mahayana the nine divisions exclude causal conditions, parables, and discussing meanings; Mahayana people have sharp roots and do not need these three. This too is a separate discussion. Generally speaking of Mahayana, how could these three sutras be absent? A sutra says: "The small vehicle only yields the broad sutra division; it has eleven divisions." Without vaipulya, the Mahayana says the Tathagata is constant and all beings have Buddha-nature. Correct principle is square; containing richness is broad. Also, the principle is fused and nondual, also called equal. These are not in the sravaka; thus it has only eleven divisions. If one says the small vehicle definitely has nine, it should not again have eleven; if one takes eleven, it also generally has twelve. Because of conditions, it is separately spoken: sometimes yielding three, sometimes yielding one, to judge great and small vehicles (and so on).

天台智者大師說
> Spoken by Great Master Zhizhe of Tiantai.

三、明對緣有異者，緣即是十因緣法所成眾生，而此眾生皆有十界根性，熟者先感。佛知成熟、未成熟者，應不失時。若眾生解脫緣未熟，不可全棄，對此機緣，止作人天乘說，不作脩多羅等名。故天竺外典，無十二部名，亦無其意。此間儒道，亦無斯名，意義皆𨷂。若法身為王，示十善道，亦不濫用此名。故《地持》中說種性菩薩，能自熟又能熟他。有二乘種性及佛種性者，隨法熟之，無種性者，以善趣熟。善趣熟者，即是其義。種性熟者，如下說。若深觀行者，妙得其意，以邪相入正相，用無礙辯，約邪經外典，作十二部義，胡為不得？而非正對緣說也。
> Third, clarifying differences in relation to conditions: conditions are sentient beings produced by the ten causal-conditions dharmas, and these beings all have ten-realm root-natures; the ripened ones are stimulated first. The Buddha knows those mature and those not mature and responds without missing the time. If a being's condition for liberation is not yet mature, it cannot be entirely abandoned; with respect to this capacity and condition, one only speaks the human-and-heaven vehicle and does not use names like sutra. Therefore external Indian classics have no name for the twelve divisions and also do not have the meaning; here, Confucianism and Daoism likewise have no such names, and their meanings are all obscure. If the Dharma-body were king and showed the ten wholesome paths, it also would not abuse this name. Therefore the Dichi says that bodhisattvas of the seed-nature can ripen themselves and can also ripen others. Those with two-vehicle seed-nature and Buddha seed-nature are ripened according to the dharma; those without seed-nature are ripened by good destinies. Those ripened by good destinies - that is the meaning. Those ripened by seed-nature, as explained below. If one deeply contemplates the practitioner, one subtly attains this meaning; using wrong marks to enter correct marks, using unobstructed eloquence, and in relation to heterodox sutras and external texts, one can make twelve-division meanings - why should it not be possible? Yet it is not a proper speaking to conditions.

次約十因緣所成眾生，有小乘根性，對此機說通，則十二；別則或九、或十一(云云)。若對十因緣所成眾生，有菩薩機者，不作別說，但明十二部經。
> Next, regarding beings produced by the ten causal-conditions: if they have small-vehicle root-nature, speaking to this capacity is generally twelve; separately it is either nine or eleven (and so on). If speaking to beings produced by the ten causal-conditions who have bodhisattva capacity, one does not make separate speaking, but only clarifies the twelve divisions of sutra.

今總論如來對四緣，說十二部法，有兩種四教不同：
> Now in general, the Tathagata, with respect to the four conditions, speaks the twelve divisions of dharma; there are two kinds of four-teaching differences:

一者、就隱、顯共論四教：隱即祕密教，顯即頓、漸、不定教。祕密既隱，非世流布，此置而不論。若對四法界眾生，通說十二部，別說或九部、或十一部，名漸法說也。若對兩法界眾生，通說十二部，此說頓法也。或對四法界，或對兩法界，或作別說、或但通說，此說不定法也。
> First, regarding hidden and revealed, jointly discussing four teachings: hidden is the secret teaching; revealed is the sudden, gradual, and indeterminate teachings. Since the secret is hidden and not circulated in the world, it is set aside and not discussed. If speaking to beings of the four dharma realms, one generally speaks the twelve divisions, separately speaking either nine or eleven divisions - this is called gradual teaching. If speaking to beings of two dharma realms, generally speaking the twelve divisions - this is called sudden teaching. Whether speaking to four dharma realms or two dharma realms, either making separate speaking or only general speaking - this is called indeterminate teaching.

二者直就顯露漸教中更明四教者，即是三藏、通、別、圓也。三藏教直對三法界，別說或九、或十一。通教對四法界，通說十二部法也。別教對兩法界，通說十二部法。圓教對一法界，通說十二部法。前以無記化化禪，與諸慈悲合，示現身輪：或為國師、道士、儒林之宗，父母、兄弟，乃至猴猨鹿馬，同事利益不可稱說。今口輪說者，例如前用諸慈悲，熏無記化化禪，種種不同，百千萬法不可說。不可說故，龍宮象負，渧海研山，八萬四千法藏，不可窮盡。雖復無崖，以十二部往收，罄無不盡也。
> Second, directly within the revealed gradual teaching, further clarifying the four teachings: namely the Tripitaka, Common, Distinct, and Perfect. The Tripitaka teaching directly addresses the three dharma realms, separately speaking either nine or eleven. The Common teaching addresses the four dharma realms and generally speaks the twelve divisions of dharma. The Distinct teaching addresses two dharma realms and generally speaks the twelve divisions of dharma. The Perfect teaching addresses one dharma realm and generally speaks the twelve divisions of dharma. Previously, using neutral transformation-upon-transformation dhyana united with various compassions, the body wheel was manifested: it could be a national teacher, a Daoist, a leader among Confucians, parents and brothers, even monkeys, apes, deer, horses, sharing activities and benefiting - beyond measure. Now as to the speech wheel, it is like before: using various compassions perfumed into neutral transformation-upon-transformation dhyana, there are many different kinds, hundreds of thousands of dharmas that cannot be spoken. Because they cannot be spoken, there are dragon palaces and elephant carriers, dripping the sea and grinding mountains; the eighty-four thousand dharma treasuries cannot be exhausted. Though boundless, by gathering them into the twelve divisions, nothing is not included and nothing is left out.

四明所詮者，若委論其意，出四教義中，今略引詮意。若說人天乘，詮界內思議之俗，永不詮真。若為漸教人，別說九部、十一部，乃至通十二部者；初、正詮思議之俗諦，傍詮思議之真諦；中、正詮思議之真諦，傍詮思議之俗諦；後、正詮不思議之真諦，傍詮不思議之俗諦也。乃至雙詮不思議之真俗(云云)。若說頓十二部者，正詮不思議之真，傍詮不思議之俗。若說不定者，此則不可定判其詮。
> Fourth, clarifying what is expressed: if one thoroughly discusses its intent, it comes from the meanings of the four teachings; here we briefly cite the intent of what is expressed. If speaking the human-and-heaven vehicle, it expresses the conventional within-the-realm of the thinkable and never expresses the true. If for gradual-teaching people, separately speaking nine divisions, eleven divisions, or even generally twelve divisions: first it chiefly expresses the thinkable conventional truth and secondarily expresses the thinkable true truth; middle it chiefly expresses the thinkable true truth and secondarily expresses the thinkable conventional truth; later it chiefly expresses the unthinkable true truth and secondarily expresses the unthinkable conventional truth; even to the point of double-expressing the unthinkable true and conventional (and so on). If speaking the sudden twelve divisions, it chiefly expresses the unthinkable true and secondarily expresses the unthinkable conventional. If speaking the indeterminate, then it cannot be definitively judged what it expresses.

若約漸中四教明詮者：三藏正詮思議真，傍詮思議俗。若為三藏菩薩者，正詮思議俗，傍詮思議真。若通教二乘，正詮思議真，傍詮思議俗。若為通教初心菩薩，同二乘；若為後心菩薩，正詮於俗，傍詮於真。若為別教初心，正詮界內之真俗，傍詮界外之真俗。若為中心，正詮界外之真俗，傍詮界內之真俗。若為後心，雙詮界內外之真俗。若為圓教，初、中、後心，圓詮界外不思議之真俗(云云)。
> If within the gradual four teachings one clarifies what is expressed: the Tripitaka chiefly expresses the thinkable true, and secondarily the thinkable conventional. If for Tripitaka bodhisattvas, chiefly expresses the thinkable conventional and secondarily the thinkable true. If for Common-teaching two-vehicles, chiefly expresses the thinkable true and secondarily the thinkable conventional. If for Common-teaching beginning-mind bodhisattvas, the same as the two vehicles; if for later-mind bodhisattvas, chiefly expresses the conventional and secondarily the true. If for Distinct-teaching beginning-mind, chiefly expresses the within-the-realm true and conventional and secondarily the beyond-the-realm true and conventional. If for middle-mind, chiefly expresses the beyond-the-realm true and conventional and secondarily the within-the-realm true and conventional. If for later-mind, it doubly expresses within-and-beyond true and conventional. If for the Perfect teaching, in beginning, middle, and later mind, it perfectly expresses the beyond-the-realm unthinkable true and conventional (and so on).

五、明麁妙者，即為五：一、約理。二、約言。三、約所詮。四、約眾經。五、正約此經。
> Fifth, clarifying coarse and subtle has five: (1) by principle, (2) by words, (3) by what is expressed, (4) by the various sutras, (5) by this sutra in particular.

一、就理妙者，一切諸法無非中道，無離文字而說解脫。文字性離即是解脫，一切所說即理而妙。譬如龍雨雨，而處處不同，或水、或火、或刀杖，理亦如是，理具情乖順耳，乖故為麁，理順為妙。
> First, by principle subtle: all dharmas are none other than the middle way; there is no liberation spoken apart from words. The nature of words is separative and is precisely liberation; all that is spoken is principle and thus subtle. It is like dragons causing rain, and yet it differs in each place - sometimes water, sometimes fire, sometimes swords and staffs. Principle is also like this; principle includes emotional opposition and accordance. Opposition is coarse; accordance is subtle.

二、約言辭者，如佛得道夜至泥洹夕，常說般若，常說中道，而一音演法，隨類異解。一音巧說，是則為妙；異類殊解，自有麁妙。
> Second, by words: from the night the Buddha attained the Way to the evening of nirvana, he constantly spoke prajna, constantly spoke the middle way, and with one sound expounded the dharma, and different kinds understood differently. One sound, skillfully spoken, is thus subtle; different kinds and different understandings have their own coarse and subtle.

三、就所詮者，若對六道眾生說人天乘者，此詮有為，能詮、所詮俱麁。若對鈍根三藏五門，詮於生滅四諦理，此則能詮、所詮俱麁。若通教體法五門，比於三藏析門，體門能詮雖巧，而所詮猶是真諦，所詮亦麁。若別教五門，能詮為麁，所詮中道為妙。若圓教五門，能詮、所詮俱皆是妙也。
> Third, by what is expressed: if, for beings of the six paths, one speaks the human-and-heaven vehicle, what is expressed is conditioned; both the expresser and the expressed are coarse. If, for dull-rooted Tripitaka with five gates, one expresses the principle of the four truths of arising and ceasing, then both the expresser and the expressed are coarse. If in the Common teaching of embodied-dharma five gates, compared to the Tripitaka analytical gate, the embodied gate as expresser is skillful, yet what is expressed is still the true truth, and what is expressed is also coarse. If in the Distinct teaching five gates, the expresser is coarse and what is expressed, the middle way, is subtle. If in the Perfect teaching five gates, both expresser and expressed are subtle.

四、就眾經者，《華嚴》詮別、詮圓。三藏詮偏。方等四種詮。《般若》三種詮。《法華》唯一詮。又諸經詮妙，與《法華》不異，而帶麁詮，麁詮不得合妙，是故為麁；《法華》不爾，佛平等說，如一味雨。正直捨方便，但說無上道，純是一詮。又云：昔毀呰聲聞，而佛實以大乘教化。又云：「汝等所行，是菩薩道。」此則融麁令妙。如此兩意，異於眾經，是故言妙。譬如良醫，能變毒為藥。二乘根敗，不能反復，名之為毒。今經得記，即是變毒為藥。故《論》云：「餘經非祕密，法華為祕密」也。復有本地圓說，諸經所無，在後當廣明(云云)。
> Fourth, by the various sutras: the Avatamsaka expresses the distinct and the perfect. The Tripitaka expresses the partial. Vaipulya expresses four kinds. Prajna expresses three kinds. The Lotus expresses only one. Also, the subtlety expressed in the various sutras is not different from the Lotus, yet they carry coarse expression; coarse expression cannot merge with subtle, therefore they are coarse. The Lotus is not so: the Buddha speaks equally, like rain of one flavor. Directly casting aside expedients, he only speaks the unsurpassed path, purely one expression. It also says: formerly he reviled sravakas, yet the Buddha actually taught them with Mahayana. It also says: "What you practice is the bodhisattva path." This merges the coarse and makes it subtle. These two meanings differ from the various sutras; therefore it is called subtle. Like a good physician, who can turn poison into medicine. The roots of the two vehicles are ruined and cannot return; this is called poison. In this sutra they receive prediction, which is turning poison into medicine. Therefore the Treatise says: "Other sutras are not secret; the Lotus is secret." Further there is the original ground's perfect teaching, which the various sutras do not have; later it will be explained broadly (and so on).

五、正就此經明妙十二部者，如脩多羅名直說，今經直說中道佛之智慧；不說六道、二乘、菩薩等法，唯說佛法，故直說為妙。
> Fifth, directly in this sutra clarifying the subtle twelve divisions: as sutra means direct exposition, this sutra directly expounds the wisdom of the middle-way Buddha; it does not speak of the six paths, two vehicles, bodhisattva dharmas, only speaks Buddha-dharma; therefore direct exposition is subtle.

祇夜妙者，重頌長行中道之說耳，故知祇夜亦妙。
> Geya subtle: it only repeats in verse the prose of the middle way; therefore geya is also subtle.

伽陀者，如龍女獻珠，喜見說偈，孤然特起。此偈明於剎那頃便成正覺，稱歎於佛成菩提事。喜見孤起，歎佛容顏甚奇妙，故知孤起伽陀妙也。
> Gatha: like the dragon girl's offering of the pearl, Gladly-Seen speaking verse, standing alone and distinct. This verse clarifies becoming complete awakening in an instant, praising the Buddha's attainment of bodhi. Gladly-Seen's solitary verse praises the Buddha's appearance as very wondrous; therefore the solitary gatha is subtle.

本事妙者，即是二萬佛所教無上道，不教餘事，即是本事妙也。
> Events subtle: this is the unsurpassed path taught by the twenty thousand Buddhas, teaching no other matters; this is events subtle.

本生妙者，明十六王子，生身生為王子，法身生為佛子，即是本生妙也。
> Births subtle: it clarifies the sixteen princes - born-body born as princes, dharma-body born as Buddha-sons; this is births subtle.

因緣者，結緣覆講大乘，繫珠不論小乘人天等緣，是名因緣妙也。
> Causal-conditions: binding affinities and covering expounding Mahayana, tying the jewel, not discussing small-vehicle humans and heavens and other conditions; this is causal-conditions subtle.

未曾有妙者，天華地動，二眉間光，三變土田等，是不可思議未曾有事妙也。
> Never-before subtle: heavenly flowers and earth shaking, light between the two brows, three transformations of land-fields, and so on - these are inconceivable never-before events, subtle.

譬喻妙者，經題以法譬為名，譬於開三顯一，何曾譬於餘事？即譬喻妙也。
> Parable subtle: the sutra title takes a dharma parable as its name, a parable for opening three and revealing one; it never parables other matters, thus parable subtle.

優波提舍妙者，身子問佛，佛答諸佛智慧門。龍女、智積問答，論法華事。智積云：「我見釋迦經無量劫，方成菩提。不信此女，須臾成佛。」此執別疑圓。龍女云：「佛自證知。」以圓珠獻佛，此以圓答別。此即提舍妙也。
> Upadesa subtle: Sariputra asked the Buddha, and the Buddha answered the wisdom-gate of all Buddhas. Dragon Girl and Wisdom Accumulated asked and answered, discussing Lotus matters. Wisdom Accumulated said: "I see that Shakyamuni, after immeasurable kalpas, only then attained bodhi. I do not believe this girl becomes Buddha in an instant." This clings to the distinct and doubts the perfect. Dragon Girl said: "The Buddha himself knows." She offered the perfect jewel to the Buddha; this responds to the distinct with the perfect. This is upadesa subtle.

無問妙者，如文云：「無問而自說，稱歎所行道，從三昧安詳而起，告舍利弗，說佛智慧。」又「宿世因緣，吾今當說」，即是無問妙也。
> Unasked subtle: as the text says, "Without being asked he himself speaks, praising the path he practiced; rising calmly from samadhi, he tells Sariputra and speaks the Buddha's wisdom." Also, "the causes and conditions of past lives, I will now speak" - this is unasked subtle.

授記妙者，授三根佛記，皆安住實智中，為天人所敬，即授記妙也。
> Prediction subtle: granting Buddha predictions to the three roots, all abide in real wisdom and are respected by gods and humans; this is prediction subtle.

方廣妙者，其車高廣，智慧深遠等，即是方廣妙也。
> Vaipulya subtle: its carriage is high and broad, wisdom deep and far-reaching; this is vaipulya subtle.

當知此經，從初直說，乃至優波提舍，十二意足，而皆是妙，此即待麁明說法妙也。
> Know that this sutra, from the initial direct exposition up to upadesa, has all twelve meanings and all are subtle; this is the subtlety of Dharma-exposition clarified by comparison with the coarse.

開麁顯妙者，昔十二、十一、九部不說實者；今無別實，異昔不實。昔但言廣，不明理廣；今開言廣，即理廣也。開昔之異，顯今之同，即是絕待明說法妙也。
> Opening coarse and revealing subtle: previously the twelve, eleven, and nine divisions did not speak the real; now there is no separate real different from the previous non-real. Previously it only said broad and did not clarify principle-broad; now by opening word-broad it is principle-broad. Opening past differences and revealing present sameness is the absolute clarification of Dharma-exposition subtlety.

第六、欠觀心(云云)。
> Sixth, contemplation of mind is lacking (and so on).
