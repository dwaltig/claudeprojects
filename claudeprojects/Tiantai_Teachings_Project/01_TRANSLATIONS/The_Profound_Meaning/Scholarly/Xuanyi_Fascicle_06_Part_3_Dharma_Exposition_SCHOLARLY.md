### Why Dharma-Exposition After Supernatural Powers

諸法不可示，言辭相寂滅；有因緣故，亦可說示。前藥、珠二身，先以定動，今毒天二鼓，後以慧拔...

> **Dharmas cannot be shown; the mark of verbal expression is quiescence.** Yet due to causes and conditions, they can also be explained and shown. Previously the two bodies of medicine-tree and wish-fulfilling jewel—first, with samādhi stirring. Now the two drums of poison and heavenly—afterward, with wisdom uprooting...

演說一乘，無三差別，皆悉到於一切智地。其所說法，皆實不虛，是故次說法妙。

> **Expounding the One Vehicle**, without threefold distinction, all reaching the ground of all-knowledge. What is spoken is **all real, not empty**—hence we next discuss Dharma-Exposition Subtlety.

---

### Six Topics

即為六意：一、釋法名。二、分大小。三、對緣同異。四、判所詮。五、明麁妙。六、明觀心。

> This has **six topics**:
> 1. Explaining the dharma-name
> 2. Distinguishing great and small
> 3. Correspondence with conditions: same and different
> 4. Determining what is expressed
> 5. Clarifying coarse and subtle
> 6. Clarifying mind-contemplation

## The Twelve Divisions of Scripture

三世佛法雖多無量，十二部經收罄無不盡。

> Though **three-world Buddha-dharma is immeasurably vast**, the **Twelve Divisions of Scripture collect it completely without remainder**.

### The Twelve Divisions

| # | Sanskrit | Chinese | Meaning |
|---|----------|---------|---------|
| 1 | **Sūtra** | 脩多羅 | Line-scripture; direct exposition |
| 2 | **Geya** | 祇夜 | Repeated verses (restating prose) |
| 3 | **Vyākaraṇa** | 和伽羅那 | Prophecy/prediction |
| 4 | **Gāthā** | 伽陀 | Non-repeated verses (independent) |
| 5 | **Udāna** | 優陀那 | Unprompted sayings |
| 6 | **Nidāna** | 尼陀那 | Cause/occasion narratives |
| 7 | **Avadāna** | 阿波陀那 | Parables/similes |

| 9 | **Jātaka** | 闍陀伽 | Birth stories |
| 10 | **Vaipulya** | 毘佛略 | Extensive/broad teaching |
| 11 | **Adbhutadharma** | 阿浮陀達摩 | Marvelous events |

### Distinguishing Great and Small

此經指九部為入大之本，則九部是小，三部是大...通而為言，小亦有記莂六道因果。

> This sūtra indicates **nine divisions as the basis for entering the great**—hence nine divisions are small, three divisions are great... Speaking comprehensively, even the small has prophecies of six-path causes and effects.

當知小乘，通具十二部也。

> Know that **Hīnayāna also comprehensively possesses all twelve divisions**.

---

### The *Lotus Sūtra*'s Twelve Divisions Made Subtle

五、正就此經明妙十二部者：

> Now directly clarifying this sūtra's **subtle twelve divisions**:

---

#### Sūtra Subtlety

如脩多羅名直說，今經直說中道佛之智慧；不說六道、二乘、菩薩等法，唯說佛法，故直說為妙。

> Sūtra means direct exposition. **This sūtra directly expounds Middle-Way Buddha-wisdom**; not explaining six-path, Two Vehicle, bodhisattva dharmas—**only Buddha-dharma**—hence direct exposition is subtle.

---

#### Geya (Repeated Verses) Subtlety

祇夜妙者，重頌長行中道之說耳，故知祇夜亦妙。

> Geya subtlety: **restating in verse the prose Middle-Way teaching**—hence geya is also subtle.

---

#### Gāthā (Independent Verses) Subtlety

伽陀者，如龍女獻珠，喜見說偈，孤然特起。此偈明於剎那頃便成正覺...故知孤起伽陀妙也。

> Gāthā: Like **Dragon Girl offering the pearl**, Gladly-Seen speaking verses—standing alone and distinct. These verses clarify **becoming fully awakened in an instant**... hence independent gāthā is subtle.

---

#### Vyākaraṇa (Prophecy) Subtlety

授記妙者，授三根佛記，皆安住實智中，為天人所敬，即授記妙也。

> Vyākaraṇa subtlety: **Giving Buddha-prophecy to three roots** [sharp, medium, dull], all **abiding in real wisdom**, respected by gods and humans—this is prophecy subtlety.

---

#### Vaipulya (Extensive) Subtlety

方廣妙者，其車高廣，智慧深遠等，即是方廣妙也。

> Vaipulya subtlety: "**The carriage is high and broad**," wisdom deep and far-reaching—this is extensive subtlety.

---

### Opening Coarse to Reveal Subtle

開麁顯妙者，昔十二、十一、九部不說實者；今無別實，異昔不實。昔但言廣，不明理廣；今開言廣，即理廣也。

> **Opening coarse to reveal subtle**: Previously twelve, eleven, or nine divisions didn't express the real; now there is no separate real different from the previous non-real. Previously only saying "extensive" without clarifying principle-extensive; **now opening word-extensive to be principle-extensive**.

開昔之異，顯今之同，即是絕待明說法妙也。

> **Opening the past differences to reveal the present sameness**—this is the Absolute [perspective on] Dharma-Exposition Subtlety.

---

## Footnotes

[^1]: The **Twelve Divisions** (十二部經) represent the complete classification of Buddhist scripture by literary form and content. Master Zhiyi shows how each division in the *Lotus Sūtra* directly expresses Middle-Way Buddha-wisdom, unlike other sūtras which expound provisional teachings.
