## ○第二、智妙
# The Second [Subtlety]: Wisdom Subtlety

---

○第二、智妙者，至理玄微，非智莫顯；智能知所，非境不融。境既融妙，智亦稱之，其猶影響矣，故次境說智。

> The second, Wisdom Subtlety: the ultimate principle is profound and subtle; without wisdom it cannot be revealed. Wisdom can know what is known; without realm it does not fuse. Since the realm is fused and subtle, wisdom also accords with it, like shadow and echo; therefore after realm we speak of wisdom.

智即為二：初、總論諸智，二、對境論智。總智為六：一、數；二、類；三、相；四、照；五、判；六、開。

> Wisdom is two: first, a general discussion of the various wisdoms; second, wisdom discussed in relation to realm. The general discussion has six: (1) number, (2) classification, (3) characteristics, (4) illumination, (5) judgment, (6) opening.

數者：一、世智。二、五停心四念處智。三、四善根智。四、四果智。五、支佛智。六、六度智。七、體法聲聞智。八、體法支佛智。九、體法菩薩入真方便智。十、體法菩薩出假智。十一、別教十信智。十二、三十心智。十三、十地智。十四、三藏佛智。十五、通教佛智。十六、別教佛智。十七、圓教五品弟子智。十八、六根清淨智。十九、初住至等覺智。二十、妙覺智。

> The number: (1) world wisdom, (2) five stopping-minds and four mindfulnesses wisdom, (3) four roots-of-good wisdom, (4) four fruits wisdom, (5) pratyekabuddha wisdom, (6) six perfections wisdom, (7) body-dharma śrāvaka wisdom, (8) body-dharma pratyekabuddha wisdom, (9) body-dharma bodhisattva entry-true expedient wisdom, (10) body-dharma bodhisattva exit-provisional wisdom, (11) Distinct teaching ten-faiths wisdom, (12) thirty-minds wisdom, (13) ten-grounds wisdom, (14) Tripiṭaka Buddha wisdom, (15) Common teaching Buddha wisdom, (16) Distinct teaching Buddha wisdom, (17) Perfect teaching five-grades disciple wisdom, (18) six-roots purified wisdom, (19) first abiding through equal awakening wisdom, (20) wondrous awakening wisdom.

二、類者，世智無道，邪計妄執，心行理外，不信不入，故為一。五停心、四念處，已入初賢佛法氣分，俱是外凡，故為一。四善根同是內凡，故為一。四果同見真，故為一。支佛別相觀能侵習，故為一。六度緣理智弱、緣事智強，故為一。通教方便聲聞體法智勝，故為一。支佛又小勝，故為一。通教菩薩入真方便智，四門遍學，故為一。通教出假菩薩智，正緣俗，故為一。別教十信智，先知中道，勝前劣後，故為一。別教三十心俱是內凡，故為一。十地同是聖智，故為一。三藏佛是師位名，勝三乘弟子，故為一。通教佛智，斷惑照機勝，故為一。別教佛智又勝，故為一。圓教五品弟子同具煩惱性，能知如來祕密之藏，故為一。六根清淨智隣真，故為一。初住至等覺同破無明，故為一。妙覺佛智無上最尊，故為一。如是等隨其類分相似者，或離、或合，判為二十(云云)。

> Second, classification: world wisdom has no path; wrong calculations and false attachments, mental activity outside principle, not believing, not entering, therefore one. Five stopping-minds and four mindfulnesses have already entered the initial worthy share of Buddha-dharma; both are outer-ordinary, therefore one. Four roots-of-good are all inner-ordinary, therefore one. Four fruits all see truth, therefore one. Pratyekabuddha's separate-aspect contemplation can encroach on habitual tendencies, therefore one. Six perfections: wisdom conditioning principle is weak, wisdom conditioning phenomena is strong, therefore one. Common teaching expedient śrāvaka body-dharma wisdom is superior, therefore one. Pratyekabuddha is slightly superior, therefore one. Common bodhisattva entry-true expedient wisdom learns all four gates, therefore one. Common exit-provisional bodhisattva wisdom properly conditions the conventional, therefore one. Distinct teaching ten-faiths wisdom first knows the Middle Way, superior to former and inferior to later, therefore one. Distinct teaching thirty minds are all inner-ordinary, therefore one. Ten grounds are all sage wisdom, therefore one. Tripiṭaka Buddha is a teacher-position name, superior to three-vehicle disciples, therefore one. Common Buddha wisdom is superior in cutting delusion and illuminating capacities, therefore one. Distinct Buddha wisdom is yet superior, therefore one. Perfect teaching five-grade disciples all possess the nature of afflictions yet can know the Tathāgata’s secret treasury, therefore one. Six-roots purified wisdom neighbors the true, therefore one. First abiding through equal awakening all break ignorance, therefore one. Wondrous awakening Buddha wisdom is unsurpassed and most honored, therefore one. Thus, by classifying those similar by kind—whether separated or combined—they are judged as twenty (and so on).

三、辨相者，天竺世智，極至非想。此間所宗，要在忠孝、五行、六藝、天文、地理、醫方、卜相、兵法、貨法、草木千種皆識，禽獸萬品知名。又塗左割右等無憎愛。獲根本定，發五神通，停河在耳，變釋為羊，納吐風雲，捫摸日月。法是世間法，定是不動定，慧是不動出。邀名利、增見愛，世心所知，故名世智也。

> Third, distinguishing characteristics: Indian world wisdom reaches at most neither-perception. What is valued here [in China] centers on loyalty and filial piety, the five phases, the six arts, astronomy, geography, medicine, divination, military strategy, commerce, knowing a thousand kinds of plants and naming ten thousand kinds of animals. Also, acts like painting left and cutting right without hatred or love. Attaining root concentration, one develops the five supernatural powers—stopping rivers in the ear, transforming Indra into a sheep, inhaling and exhaling wind and clouds, touching sun and moon. The dharmas are worldly dharmas; the concentration is immovable concentration; the wisdom is an immovable exit. Seeking fame and profit, increasing views and craving—known by the worldly mind—therefore called world wisdom.

五停、四念者，有定故言停，有慧故言觀。觀能翻邪，定能制亂。數息治散，不淨治貪，滋治瞋，因緣治癡，念佛治障道。念處是觀苦諦上四智，治於四倒；四倒不起，由此四觀。初翻四倒，未入聖理，故言外凡智也。

> As for the five stoppings and four mindfulnesses: because there is concentration, it is called stopping; because there is wisdom, it is called contemplation. Contemplation can overturn the wrong; concentration can control disorder. Counting breaths treats scattering; impurity treats greed; kindness treats anger; dependent origination treats delusion; mindfulness of Buddha treats obstacles to the path. The mindfulnesses are the four wisdoms contemplating the Truth of Suffering, treating the four inversions; the four inversions do not arise through these four contemplations. Initially overturning the four inversions, one has not yet entered the noble principle, therefore it is called outer-ordinary wisdom.

煖法緣四諦境生智，伏煩惱，智更增，成十六觀智。如火鑽，上下相依，生火燒薪。以有智知有境，能生煖智，令有萎悴。如夏時聚華為𧂐，華生煖氣，還自萎悴。又依陰、觀陰，發智火，還燒陰，如兩竹相摩生火，還燒竹林。尊者瞿沙說：求解脫智火，煖最在初。如火，以煙在初為相。無漏智火亦以煖法在先為相。如日，明相在初為相，是故名煖。

> In Warmth-dharma, wisdom arises by conditioning the realm of the four truths; it subdues afflictions and wisdom further increases, becoming the sixteen contemplation-wisdoms. It is like a fire-drill: above and below depend on each other, producing fire to burn fuel. Because there is wisdom knowing there is a realm, it can produce warmth-wisdom, causing existence to wither. Like gathering flowers in summer into a heap (𧂐): the flowers generate warm vapor and then wither themselves. Again, relying on the aggregates and contemplating the aggregates, one kindles the wisdom-fire, which burns the aggregates, like two bamboos rubbing to make fire and then burning the bamboo grove. Venerable Ghoṣa said: seeking the wisdom-fire of liberation, warmth is most at the beginning. Like fire, having smoke at the beginning as its mark; the fire of outflow-free wisdom also takes warmth-dharma as the prior mark. Like the sun, the bright sign is its initial mark; therefore it is called Warmth.

於正法毘尼中生信，愛敬正法者，緣道諦，信毘尼者，緣滅諦。信煖能緣四諦，云何言二？答：此二最勝，應先說。又，正法是三諦，毘尼是滅諦。如佛為滿宿：「我有四句法，當為汝說，欲知不？當恣汝意。」四句即四諦也。所有布施、持戒，盡向解脫，是其意趣。色界定起，是其依。於自地前生善根，是相似因緣。於四真諦，頂是其功用果。自地相似，後生善根，是依果。色界五陰是其報。涅槃決定因及不斷善根，是其利。十六行是其行，是緣生，是修慧。色界繫三三昧，三根隨所說，相應眾多心，是退。

> Within the right dharma-vinaya faith arises. Those who love and respect right dharma condition the Path Truth; those who trust the vinaya condition the Cessation Truth. Faith and warmth can condition the Four Truths—why speak of two? **Answer:** these two are the most excellent and should be spoken first. Again, right dharma is the three truths; vinaya is the Cessation Truth. As when the Buddha spoke for Mansu: "I have a four‑phrase dharma; I will tell you—do you wish to know? I will follow your intent." The four phrases are the Four Truths. All giving and precepts tend toward liberation—this is its intent. Form‑realm concentration arising is its support. Good roots arising before one’s own stage are similar causal conditions. In the Four True Truths, summit is its functional fruit. Similarity in one’s own stage, later generating good roots, is the supporting fruit. The five aggregates of the form realm are its retribution. The decisive cause of nirvāṇa and unbroken good roots are its benefit. The sixteen practices are its practice; they are condition‑arising and cultivate wisdom. The form realm’s three samādhis, with the three roots according to what is taught, and many associated minds, is regression.

煖有三種：謂下下、下中、下上。頂有三：中下、中中、中上。忍有二種：上下、上中。世第一有一種：謂上上。此四善根以三言之，煖是下，頂是中，忍、世第一是上。復有說者：煖有二：謂下下、下中。頂有三：謂下上、中下、中中。忍有三：謂中上、上下、上中。世第一法有一：謂上上。亦以三言之，煖是下下，頂是下中，忍是中上，世第一是上上。瞿沙云：「煖有下三，頂有六：下下乃至中上。忍有八：下下乃至上中。世第一但上上。以三言之，煖法一種，謂下。頂法二種，謂下、中。忍有三種，謂下、中、上。世第一有一種，謂上。」煖有二捨：一、離界地，二、退時。退時捨，墮地獄，作五無間而不斷善根。頂亦如是。忍唯一捨，不墮地獄(云云)。

> Warmth has three kinds: lower‑lower, lower‑middle, lower‑upper. Summit has three: middle‑lower, middle‑middle, middle‑upper. Patience has two: upper‑lower and upper‑middle. World‑First has one: upper‑upper. Speaking these four roots of good in three terms: warmth is lower, summit is middle, patience and world‑first are upper. Another says: warmth has two (lower‑lower, lower‑middle); summit has three (lower‑upper, middle‑lower, middle‑middle); patience has three (middle‑upper, upper‑lower, upper‑middle); world‑first has one (upper‑upper). Also speaking in three terms: warmth is lower‑lower, summit is lower‑middle, patience is middle‑upper, world‑first is upper‑upper. Ghoṣa says: "Warmth has three lowers; summit has six, from lower‑lower to middle‑upper. Patience has eight, from lower‑lower to upper‑middle. World‑first only upper‑upper. Speaking in three terms: warmth is one kind, called lower; summit has two kinds, called lower and middle; patience has three kinds, called lower, middle, and upper; world‑first has one kind, called upper." Warmth has two relinquishments: (1) leaving its realm‑stage, (2) at the time of regression. At regression one falls to hell, committing the five immediate offenses yet not cutting off good roots. Summit is also thus. Patience has only one relinquishment and does not fall to hell (and so on).

頂法者，色界善根，有動、不動，住、不住，有難、不難，斷、不斷，退、不退。就動乃至退者，有二：下者是煖，上是頂。彼不動乃至不退者為二：下者是忍，上者是世第一法。復有說者，應言下頂。所以者何？在煖法頂，故名頂。在忍法下，故名下。復有說者，如山頂之道，人不久住。若無難，必過此到彼；若遇難，即便退還。行者住頂不久，若無難必到忍；有難退還煖。猶如山頂，故名頂。

> Summit‑dharma: form‑realm good roots, with moving and unmoving, abiding and not abiding, with difficulty and without difficulty, cutting and not cutting, regressing and not regressing. Among those moving through regressing there are two: lower is warmth, upper is summit. Among those unmoving through non‑regressing there are two: lower is patience, upper is world‑first‑dharma. Another says it should be called lower‑summit. Why? At the summit of warmth‑dharma it is called summit; at the lower of patience‑dharma it is called lower. Another says: it is like the path on a mountain summit; people do not stay long. Without difficulty they must cross to the other side; with difficulty they retreat. Practitioners at the summit do not stay long—without difficulty they will reach patience; with difficulty they retreat to warmth. Like a mountain summit, therefore it is called summit.

云何為觀？於佛、法、僧生下小信。小信者，此法不久停，故言下小。此信緣佛生小信，是緣道諦。緣法生下小信，是緣滅諦。

> What is contemplation? One gives rise to low, small faith in Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. "Small faith" means this dharma does not remain long, therefore it is called low and small. This faith conditions Buddha to produce small faith; it conditions the Path Truth. Conditioning Dharma produces low small faith; it conditions the Cessation Truth.

問：

> **Question:**

應能緣四諦，云何言緣二諦？答：

> If one can condition the Four Truths, why speak of conditioning two truths? **Answer:**

道、滅勝故。清淨無過，是妙、是離。能生信處，為生受化者信樂心故。若世尊說苦、集是可信敬者，則無受化者。此煩惱、惡行，邪見、顛倒，云何可敬信？我常為此逼迫。受化者於道、滅生欣樂，是故說二也。

> Because the Path and Cessation are superior. Pure and faultless, they are subtle and transcendent. They are places that can give rise to faith, in order to give rise to the hearers’ joyful faith. If the World‑Honored One said suffering and accumulation were worthy of faith and respect, there would be no one to be transformed. These are afflictions and evil actions, wrong views and inversions—how could they be respected and trusted? I am always oppressed by these. Those to be transformed rejoice in the Path and Cessation, therefore two are spoken.

復有說者，信佛、僧是緣道，信法是緣三諦，則盡信四諦也。

> Another says: faith in Buddha and Sangha conditions the Path; faith in Dharma conditions the three truths—thus one fully trusts the Four Truths.

問：

> **Question:**

住頂亦信陰，亦信寶，亦信諦。何故但說信三寶？答：

> At the summit one also trusts the aggregates, also trusts the jewels, also trusts the truths. Why speak only of trusting the Three Jewels? **Answer:**

三寶是生信敬處。但隨行者意，於陰生悅適，是名為煖。於寶生悅適，是名為頂。於諦生悅適，是名為忍。

> The Three Jewels are places that give rise to faith and respect. Yet according to the practitioner’s intent, delight arising with the aggregates is called warmth; delight arising with the jewels is called summit; delight arising with the truths is called patience.

問：

> **Question:**

何故頂退，不說煖退？

> Why speak of summit regression and not warmth regression?

答：

> **Answer:**

頂既退，亦應說煖退。行者在頂時，多煩惱業留難。煩惱等作是念：若行者到忍，我復於誰身中當作果報？若離欲界時，亦念：行者出欲界，我復於誰身中生果報？離非想非非想處時，亦念：行者離彼欲已，更不受身，我復於誰身中生於果報？於此三時，多諸留難。留難退，故大憂惱。如人見寶藏大喜，欲取即失。住頂法者自念：不久當得於忍，永斷惡道，獲大重利，猶如聖人。而忽退失，故大憂惱，是故言頂退也。

> If summit regresses, one should also speak of warmth regression. When a practitioner is at summit, many afflictive karmas create obstacles. The afflictions think: if the practitioner reaches patience, in whose body shall I produce retribution? If he leaves the desire realm, they think: once he leaves the desire realm, in whose body shall I give rise to fruit? When he leaves the neither‑perception‑nor‑non‑perception realm, they think: once he has left that desire, he will no longer take a body—within whom shall I produce fruit? At these three times there are many obstacles. With obstacles and regression, there is great anxiety. It is like someone who sees a treasure store, rejoices greatly, and then loses it as he tries to take it. The summit practitioner thinks: soon I will attain patience, forever cut off evil paths, and gain great profit, like a sage—yet suddenly he regresses and loses it; thus there is great anxiety. Therefore it is called summit regression.

若能親近善友，從其聞隨順方便法，內心正觀，信佛菩提，信善說法，信僧清淨功德，是說信寶。說色無常，乃至說識無常，是說信陰。知有苦、集、滅、道，是說信諦。若如是即住頂，若不如是即頂退。

> If one can closely approach good friends and hear from them compliant expedient dharmas, with inner mind rightly contemplating; believing in Buddha‑bodhi, believing in the well‑spoken dharma, believing in the Sangha’s pure merit—this is called trusting the jewels. Speaking that form is impermanent up to that consciousness is impermanent is called trusting the aggregates. Knowing there is suffering, accumulation, cessation, and path is called trusting the truths. If one is thus, one abides at summit; if not, one regresses from summit.

忍法觀者，正觀欲界苦，色、無色界苦。欲界行集，色、無色界行集。欲界行滅，色、無色界行滅。斷欲界行道，斷色、無色界行道。如是三十二心，是名下忍。行者後時，漸漸減損行及緣，復更正觀欲界苦，色、無色界苦，乃至觀斷欲界行道，除觀斷色、無色界行道，從是中名中忍。復更正觀欲界苦，觀色、無色界苦，乃至觀色、無色界行滅，除滅一切道。復正觀欲界苦，色、無色界苦，乃至觀欲界行滅，除色、無色界行滅。復正觀欲界苦，乃至觀色、無色界行集，除滅一切滅。復正觀欲界苦，乃至觀欲界行集，除色、無色界行集。復正觀欲界、色、無色苦，除一切集。復正觀欲界苦，除色、無色界苦。復正觀欲界常，相續不斷，不遠離。如是觀時，深生厭患，復更減損，但作二心觀於一行，如似苦法忍、[A1]苦法智。如是正觀，是名中忍。復以一心觀欲界苦，是名上忍。

> In patience‑dharma contemplation, one correctly contemplates desire‑realm suffering, form‑realm suffering, formless‑realm suffering; desire‑realm practice accumulation, form‑realm and formless‑realm practice accumulation; desire‑realm practice cessation, form‑realm and formless‑realm practice cessation; cutting desire‑realm practice‑path, cutting form‑realm and formless‑realm practice‑path. Thus thirty‑two minds are called lower patience. Later the practitioner gradually reduces practices and conditions, again correctly contemplates desire‑realm suffering, form‑realm and formless‑realm suffering, up to contemplating cutting desire‑realm practice‑path, removing contemplation of cutting form‑realm and formless‑realm practice‑path; from this the middle patience is named. Again correctly contemplates desire‑realm suffering, contemplates form‑realm and formless‑realm suffering, up to contemplating cessation of form‑realm and formless‑realm practice, removing cessation of all paths. Again correctly contemplates desire‑realm suffering, form‑realm and formless‑realm suffering, up to contemplating desire‑realm practice cessation, removing form‑realm and formless‑realm practice cessation. Again correctly contemplates desire‑realm suffering, up to contemplating form‑realm and formless‑realm practice accumulation, removing cessation of all cessations. Again correctly contemplates desire‑realm suffering, up to contemplating desire‑realm practice accumulation, removing form‑realm and formless‑realm practice accumulation. Again correctly contemplates desire‑realm, form‑realm, formless‑realm sufferings, removing all accumulation. Again correctly contemplates desire‑realm suffering, removing form‑realm and formless‑realm suffering. Again correctly contemplates desire‑realm permanence, continuity without break, not far removed. When contemplating thus, deep aversion arises; one further reduces, making only two minds contemplate one practice, like suffering‑dharma patience and [A1] suffering‑dharma wisdom. Such correct contemplation is called middle patience. Again with one mind contemplating desire‑realm suffering is called upper patience.

    [A1] 苦【CB】，忍【大】(cf. X57n0977_p0624a19)

> [A1] "苦" [CB], "忍" [D] (cf. X57n0977_p0624a19)

復次，生世第一法，世第一法後，次生苦法忍。譬如人欲從己國適他國，多財產，不能持去，以物易錢；猶嫌錢，易金；嫌金，易多價寶，往適他國。行者乃至漸捨，相續不離，生於上忍。上忍後，生第一法。第一法後，生苦忍。

> Furthermore, when world‑first dharma arises, after world‑first dharma, suffering‑dharma patience arises next. It is like a person who wishes to go from his own country to another: having much property, he cannot carry it, so he trades goods for money; still disliking money, he trades for gold; disliking gold, he trades for precious jewels, and goes to the other country. So the practitioner gradually relinquishes, continuous and not departing, and gives rise to upper patience. After upper patience, world‑first dharma arises; after world‑first dharma, suffering‑patience arises.

問：

> **Question:**

世第一法有三品不？

> Does world‑first dharma have three grades?

答：

> **Answer:**

一人無，多人有。身子上，目連中，餘皆下。就佛、支佛、聲聞為三品。

> One person does not have [three grades], many people do. Śāriputra is upper, Maudgalyāyana middle, the rest are lower. With respect to Buddha, pratyekabuddha, and śrāvaka, there are three grades.

世第一法者，此心心數法，於餘法為最、為勝、為長、為尊、為上、為妙。亦分、亦都。分者，勝世間法，不勝見諦。見諦眷屬不相離，慧力偏多故、熏禪不與凡夫同生一處故。盡智時，一切善根永離一切諸垢障故。三三昧乃至惡賤無漏，何況有漏，不應都勝？分勝彼煖、頂、忍法，亦應言第一，應言分勝，勝煖、頂、忍、一切凡夫所得禪，無量解脫除入也。或言都勝，非謂一切事業中勝，但以能開聖道門故。彼見諦等，不能開聖道門，以世第一法開聖道門，彼見諦等法得修見諦等法。得修者，皆是世第一法功用。是世第一法名義者，最勝義是第一義；得妙果是第一義，如高幢頂，更無有上，是第一義。

> World‑first dharma: this mind and mental factors, compared to other dharmas, are the most, the superior, the chief, the honored, the uppermost, the subtle. It is also partial and total. "Partial" means it surpasses worldly dharmas but does not surpass seeing the truths. The retinue of seeing the truths does not depart, because wisdom power is especially abundant and because infused meditation does not arise in the same place as ordinary beings. At the time of exhaustion‑knowledge, all good roots forever depart from all defilement‑obstructions. From the three samādhis up to base outflow‑free—how much more with outflows—therefore it should not be totally superior. It partially surpasses warmth, summit, and patience dharmas, and should also be called first; it should be called partial superiority, surpassing warmth, summit, patience, and all meditations obtained by ordinary beings, including immeasurable liberations and the formless absorptions. Some say it is totally superior—not meaning superior in all affairs, but because it can open the gate of the noble path. Those seeing the truths and so on cannot open the gate of the noble path; with world‑first dharma opening the gate of the noble path, those seeing‑truths dharmas can be cultivated. What is cultivated is all the function of world‑first dharma. As for the name and meaning of world‑first dharma: the most superior meaning is first meaning; attaining the subtle fruit is first meaning—like the top of a high banner, with nothing higher—this is first meaning.

問：

> **Question:**

前諸義有差別邪？答：

> Do the preceding meanings differ? **Answer:**

此皆歎說上妙之義，亦有差別。於不淨安般名最，於聞慧名勝，於思慧名長，於煖為尊，於頂為上，於忍為妙。又，依未至為最，依初禪為勝，中間為長，二禪為尊，三禪為上，四禪為妙。如是種種說，此依《毘婆沙》釋，欲委知，向彼尋。

> These all praise and explain upper subtle meanings, and there are also differences. In impurity and breath‑counting, it is called "most"; in listening‑wisdom, "superior"; in thinking‑wisdom, "chief"; in warmth, "honored"; in summit, "upper"; in patience, "subtle." Again, relying on the preparatory stage is "most"; relying on first dhyāna is "superior"; the middle is "chief"; second dhyāna is "honored"; third dhyāna is "upper"; fourth dhyāna is "subtle." These various explanations follow the *Vibhāṣā*; if you wish to know in detail, seek there.

初果八忍、八智。三果重慮緣真，九無礙、九解脫智。支佛用總相、別相，如約三世明苦、集，分別十二因緣，即別相相也。六度緣理智弱，伏而未斷；事智強，能捨身命財，無所遺顧。聲聞能發真成聖，猶論我衣、我鉢，互論強弱(云云)。

> The first fruit has eight patiences and eight wisdoms. The third fruit, with repeated deliberation conditioning truth, has nine unobstructed and nine liberation wisdoms. Pratyekabuddhas use general and specific aspects; for example, explaining suffering and accumulation across the three times and distinguishing the twelve links is the specific‑aspect mark. The six perfections have weak wisdom conditioning principle, subduing but not cutting; strong wisdom conditioning phenomena, able to give up body, life, and wealth without remainder. Śrāvakas can give rise to truth and become sages, yet they still argue over “my robe” and “my bowl,” debating strength and weakness (and so on).

通教聲聞，總相一門，達俗即真。通教緣覺，能於一門總相、別相，達俗即真。通教菩薩，能於四門總相、別相，俗達即真。又能遍四門出假，教化眾生。十信信果頭真如實相，為求此理，起十信心。十住正習入空，傍習假中。十行正習假，傍習中。十迴向正習中。初地證中；二地已上，重慮於中。三藏佛一時用三十四心：八忍、八智、九無礙、九解脫，斷正習盡。通佛坐道場，一念相應慧，斷餘殘習氣。別教佛用金剛後心，斷一品無明究竟盡成佛。或言：斷時是等覺。佛無所斷，但證得圓滿菩提具足耳。圓五品不斷五欲而淨諸根，具煩惱性，能知如來祕密之藏。六根淨位獲相似中道智。初住獲如來一身無量身，入法流海中行，任運流注。後位可解，不復記。

> Common‑teaching śrāvakas, in the single gate of general aspect, realize that conventional is true. Common‑teaching pratyekabuddhas can, in the single gate, use general and specific aspects and realize conventional as true. Common‑teaching bodhisattvas can, in the four gates, use general and specific aspects and realize conventional as true. They can also, through the four gates, emerge from the provisional and teach beings. The ten faiths trust the fruit‑head true‑thusness real‑mark; seeking this principle, they arouse the ten‑faiths mind. Ten abidings primarily cultivate emptiness, secondarily cultivate provisional and middle. Ten practices primarily cultivate provisional, secondarily middle. Ten dedications primarily cultivate middle. The first ground realizes the middle; from the second ground and above, there is repeated deliberation on the middle. The Tripiṭaka Buddha at one time uses thirty‑four minds: eight patiences, eight wisdoms, nine unobstructed, nine liberation, cutting both proper and habitual completely. The Common Buddha sits at the Way‑place; with a single‑thought concordant wisdom, he cuts remaining residual habits. The Distinct teaching Buddha uses the post‑vajra mind to cut one grade of ignorance completely and become Buddha. Some say that the time of cutting is equal awakening. The Buddha has nothing to cut; he only attains perfect, complete bodhi. In the Perfect teaching, the five grades do not cut the five desires and yet purify the six roots; possessing the nature of afflictions, they can know the Tathāgata's secret treasury. The six‑roots‑purified stage obtains a similar middle‑way wisdom. The first abiding attains the Tathāgata’s one body with immeasurable bodies, enters the sea of dharma‑flows and acts, flowing spontaneously. The later stages can be understood and are not recorded further.

四、明智照境者，若由智照境，由境發智，四句皆墮性中，如別記(云云)。若四悉檀因緣立境、智，但有名字(云云)。

> Fourth, clarifying wisdom illuminating realm: if wisdom illuminates realm, or realm gives rise to wisdom, the four statements all fall into the nature category, as recorded separately (and so on). If the four siddhānta causal conditions establish realm and wisdom, they only have names (and so on).

問：

> **Question:**

智能照境，境亦能照智不？答：

> Can wisdom illuminate realm, and can realm also illuminate wisdom? **Answer:**

若作不思議釋，更互相照，義亦無妨。《仁王般若》云：「說智及智處，皆名為般若。」譬鏡面互相照，亦如大地一，能生種種芽，芽亦生地一。且置斯義。世智照六道十如。五停心智去至體法，凡七智，照二乘十如。六度及通教出假菩薩智兩屬，上求照菩薩十如，下化照六道十如。四十心智亦兩屬：上求照菩薩十如，下化照六道十如。十地智兩屬，次第照，照菩薩十如；不次第照，照佛十如。五品去，凡四智，皆照佛界十如。總略如此細捒(云云)。

> If explained as inconceivable, mutually illuminating is also unobstructed in meaning. The *Renwang Prajñā* says: "Speaking of wisdom and the place of wisdom, both are called prajñā." It is like mirror faces illuminating each other, and like the single great earth producing various sprouts, and the sprouts also producing the one earth. Let this meaning rest. World wisdom illuminates the ten suchnesses of the six destinies. The five stopping‑minds wisdom up to body‑dharma—seven wisdoms in all—illuminate the ten suchnesses of the Two Vehicles. The six perfections and the Common‑teaching exit‑provisional bodhisattva wisdom are of two kinds: upward they seek to illuminate the bodhisattva ten suchnesses; downward they transform by illuminating the six‑destiny ten suchnesses. The forty‑mind wisdoms are also of two kinds: upward they seek to illuminate the bodhisattva ten suchnesses; downward they transform by illuminating the six‑destiny ten suchnesses. The ten‑grounds wisdoms are of two kinds: sequentially illuminating the bodhisattva ten suchnesses; non‑sequentially illuminating the Buddha ten suchnesses. From the five grades onward, four wisdoms in all illuminate the Buddha‑realm ten suchnesses. In summary, this is the detailed arrangement (and so on).

二十智照四種十二因緣境者，世智、五停、四念、四果乃至支佛、六度、三藏佛，凡七智，照思議生滅十二因緣境。通教三乘入真方便智、出假智、佛智凡五智，照思議不生不滅十二因緣境。別教十信、三十心、十地、佛凡四智，照不思議生滅十二因緣境。其中不無別意，且從大判。圓教四智，照不思議不生不滅十二因緣境。

> As for the twenty wisdoms illuminating the four kinds of twelve‑link realms: world wisdom, five stopping‑minds, four mindfulnesses, four fruits up to pratyekabuddha, six perfections, and Tripiṭaka Buddha—seven wisdoms in all—illuminate the conceivable arising‑and‑ceasing twelve‑link realm. The Common‑teaching three vehicles’ entry‑true expedient wisdom, exit‑provisional wisdom, and Buddha wisdom—five wisdoms in all—illuminate the conceivable non‑arising‑non‑ceasing twelve‑link realm. Distinct‑teaching ten faiths, thirty minds, ten grounds, and Buddha—four wisdoms in all—illuminate the inconceivable arising‑and‑ceasing twelve‑link realm. Among them there are not no special intentions; for now we follow the broad judgment. The Perfect teaching’s four wisdoms illuminate the inconceivable non‑arising‑non‑ceasing twelve‑link realm.

二十智照四種四諦者，前、三藏等七智，照生滅四諦境。次、通教五智，照無生滅四諦境。次、別教四智，照無量四諦境。次、圓教四智，照無作四諦境。

> As for the twenty wisdoms illuminating the four kinds of Four Truths: first, the seven wisdoms such as the Tripiṭaka illuminate the arising‑and‑ceasing Four Truths realm. Next, the Common teaching’s five wisdoms illuminate the non‑arising‑and‑ceasing Four Truths realm. Next, the Distinct teaching’s four wisdoms illuminate the immeasurable Four Truths realm. Next, the Perfect teaching’s four wisdoms illuminate the without‑action Four Truths realm.

次、二十智照二諦者，前、七智是照析空之二諦。次、五智是照體空之二諦。次、八智照顯中之二諦。其間別、圓相入者，可以意得(云云)。

> Next, as to the twenty wisdoms illuminating the Two Truths: first, seven wisdoms illuminate the Two Truths of analyzed‑emptiness. Next, five wisdoms illuminate the Two Truths of embodied‑emptiness. Next, eight wisdoms illuminate the Two Truths that reveal the middle. The interpenetrations of Distinct and Perfect among them can be understood by intent (and so on).

次、明二十智照三諦者，前、七智照無中之二諦，是因緣所生法，皆屬俗攝。次、五智照含中之二諦，即空一句，皆屬真諦攝也。次、別圓八智照顯中之二諦，即是假名，亦名中道，二句皆屬中道諦攝也。

> Next, clarifying the twenty wisdoms illuminating the Three Truths: the first seven wisdoms illuminate the Two Truths without middle—condition‑arisen dharmas, all encompassed by the conventional. Next, five wisdoms illuminate the Two Truths containing middle—namely the single phrase “emptiness,” all encompassed by the True Truth. Next, the Distinct and Perfect eight wisdoms illuminate the Two Truths that reveal the middle—namely provisional names, also called the Middle Way; both phrases are encompassed by the Middle Truth.

次、二十智照一實諦者，此須引《釋論》明四悉檀，皆名為實。世界故實，乃至第一義故實。當知實語亦通四諦，生滅故實，無生滅故實，無量故實，無作故實。前、三藏七智照生滅之實。次、通教五智照無生滅之實。次、別教四智照無量之實。次、圓教四智照無作之實。前後諸實(云云)。

> Next, as to the twenty wisdoms illuminating the One Real Truth: here one must cite the *Śāstra* to clarify the four siddhāntas, all called real—real because of the world, up to real because of first meaning. You should know that real speech also spans the Four Truths: real because of arising‑and‑ceasing, real because of non‑arising‑and‑ceasing, real because of immeasurable, real because of without‑action. First, the Tripiṭaka seven wisdoms illuminate the real of arising‑and‑ceasing. Next, the Common teaching five wisdoms illuminate the real of non‑arising‑and‑ceasing. Next, the Distinct teaching four wisdoms illuminate the real of immeasurable. Next, the Perfect teaching four wisdoms illuminate the real of without‑action. The various reals before and after (and so on).

次、二十智無諦、無照者，無諦無別理，若於四種四諦得悟，不復見諦與不諦，故無諦亦通也。前、七智照生滅之無諦，生生不可說故。次、五智照無生滅之無諦，生不生不可說故。次、四智照無量之無諦，不生生不可說故。次、四智照無作之無諦，不生不生不可說故。前、無諦是權，後、無諦是實，此就言教。若就妙悟同於聖人心中所照者，則不見有權實，故非權非實。空拳誑小兒，誘度於一切。方便說權，方便說實。會理之時，無復權實，故稱非權非實為妙也。

> Next, as to the twenty wisdoms [as] no‑truth and no‑illumination: no‑truth has no separate principle. If one awakens in the four kinds of Four Truths, one no longer sees truth and not‑truth; thus no‑truth also pervades. First, seven wisdoms illuminate the no‑truth of arising‑and‑ceasing, because arising‑arising cannot be spoken. Next, five wisdoms illuminate the no‑truth of non‑arising‑and‑ceasing, because arising‑non‑arising cannot be spoken. Next, four wisdoms illuminate the no‑truth of immeasurable, because non‑arising‑arising cannot be spoken. Next, four wisdoms illuminate the no‑truth of without‑action, because non‑arising‑non‑arising cannot be spoken. The earlier no‑truth is provisional; the later no‑truth is real—this is in terms of teaching. If in terms of subtle awakening, identical to what is illuminated in sages’ minds, then one does not see provisional and real; therefore it is neither provisional nor real. An empty fist deceives a small child, guiding and ferrying all. Expedients speak of provisional; expedients speak of real. When principle is met, provisional and real are no more; therefore calling neither provisional nor real “subtle.”

五、明麁妙者，前十二番智是麁，後八番智為妙。何者？藏、通等佛，自是無常，亦不說常，彼二乘菩薩何得聞常、信常、修常？是故為麁。別教十信初已聞常，信、修於常，尚勝彼佛，何況餘耶？是故為妙。常途云：《法華》不明常者，秖是三藏意耳。今明十信知中已過牟尼，則八番為妙也。

> Fifth, clarifying coarse and subtle: the first twelve kinds of wisdom are coarse; the latter eight are subtle. Why? The Buddhas of the Tripiṭaka and Common are themselves impermanent and also do not speak of permanence; how could the Two‑Vehicle bodhisattvas hear permanence, believe in permanence, or cultivate permanence? Therefore they are coarse. The Distinct teaching ten faiths at first already hear permanence; believing and cultivating permanence surpass even those Buddhas, much more the rest—therefore subtle. Commonly it is said: the *Lotus* does not clarify permanence; that is only the Tripiṭaka intention. Now we clarify that the ten faiths already know the middle and surpass the muni; thus the eight kinds are subtle.

又，別教四智，三麁一妙。圓教四智，悉皆稱妙。何者？地人云：「中道乃是果頭能顯，初心學者仰信此理，如藕絲懸山。」故說信、行皆非圓意也。故十信智為麁。十住正修空，傍修假、中。十行正修假，傍修中。十迴向始正修中。此中但理，不具諸法，是故皆麁。登地智破無明，見中道，證則為妙。類如通、藏兩種，俱得道，而三藏門拙。今別教亦爾，教門皆權，而證是妙(云云)。

> Again, in the Distinct teaching’s four wisdoms, three are coarse and one subtle. The Perfect teaching’s four wisdoms are all called subtle. Why? The ground‑people say: "The Middle Way can only be revealed at the fruit‑stage; beginners look up and believe this principle like hanging a mountain by a lotus fiber." Therefore they say faith and practice are not Perfect intention. Thus ten‑faiths wisdom is coarse. Ten abidings primarily cultivate emptiness, secondarily provisional and middle. Ten practices primarily cultivate provisional, secondarily middle. Ten dedications begin primarily cultivating middle. This middle is only principle and does not contain all dharmas; therefore all are coarse. Ground‑attaining wisdom breaks ignorance, sees the Middle Way; realization is subtle. It is like the Common and Tripiṭaka: both attain the path, yet the Tripiṭaka gate is clumsy. Now the Distinct teaching is likewise: the teaching gates are all provisional, while the realization is subtle (and so on).

圓教四智皆妙者，如法相說，如說而信，如理而行，始論五品，終竟妙覺，實而非權，是故皆妙。是名待麁智說妙智也。

> As for the Perfect teaching’s four wisdoms all being subtle: as dharma‑marks are spoken, so one believes; as principle is, so one practices. Beginning with the five grades and ending in wondrous awakening, real and not provisional—therefore all subtle. This is called explaining subtle wisdom by contrasting coarse wisdom.

又、約知見明麁妙者，知與見云何？然分別有四：不知不見、知非見、見非知、亦知亦見。先、約三藏釋，後、約圓釋，中間例可解。凡夫不聞故不知，不證故不見。五停、四念至世第一法，聞故名知，未證故非見。辟支佛不聞故非知，自然證故是見。四果聞故亦是知，證故亦是見。傳傳判麁妙，可解。

> Again, clarifying coarse and subtle by knowledge and seeing: what are knowledge and seeing? The distinctions are four: not knowing and not seeing, knowing but not seeing, seeing but not knowing, and both knowing and seeing. First interpret by the Tripiṭaka, later by the Perfect; the middle can be understood by analogy. Ordinary people do not hear, so they do not know; they do not realize, so they do not see. The five stoppings and four mindfulnesses up to world‑first dharma, because they hear are called knowing, but not realizing, therefore not seeing. Pratyekabuddhas, not hearing, therefore not knowing; naturally realizing, therefore seeing. The four fruits, because they hear, are also knowing; because they realize, they are also seeing. Passing down the judgments of coarse and subtle can be understood.

約圓教釋者，七方便不聞故不知，未證故不見。五品、六根，聞故知，未證故不見。發宿習者名見，不從聞故不知。稟教證入者，亦知、亦見。此節節傳為麁妙。

> In Perfect‑teaching interpretation: the seven expedients do not hear, so they do not know; not realizing, they do not see. The five grades and six roots hear, so they know; not realizing, they do not see. Those who arise from past habit are called seeing, not hearing therefore not knowing. Those who receive the teaching and realize entering both know and see. These stages are transmitted as coarse and subtle.

究竟而論，前來二十種智，略而言之，不出權、實二智。如經：「如來方便知見，波羅蜜皆悉具足」，即總束得前來諸權智也。「如來知見廣大深遠」，即是總束前來實智也。方便既其具足，何所不該？知見既其廣大深遠，何所不攝？境淵無邊，智水莫測，唯佛與佛乃能究盡。如此知見，即是眼智。眼即五眼具足，智即三智一心。一切種智知於實，兩智知於權。佛眼見於實，四眼見於權。此知即是見，此見即是知。對前諸智，諸智是麁，此之知見名之為妙也。

> Ultimately speaking, the twenty wisdoms above, in brief, do not go beyond the two wisdoms of provisional and real. As the sutra says, "The Tathāgata’s expedient knowledge and seeing, the pāramitās, are all fully complete"—this gathers all the prior provisional wisdoms. "The Tathāgata’s knowledge and seeing are vast and deep"—this gathers all the prior real wisdoms. Expedients being complete, what is not included? Knowledge and seeing being vast and deep, what is not encompassed? The realm is deep and boundless; the waters of wisdom are unfathomable—only Buddha with Buddha can fully exhaust them. Such knowledge and seeing is eye‑wisdom. Eye means the five eyes complete; wisdom means the three wisdoms in one mind. Omniscient wisdom knows the real; the two wisdoms know the provisional. The Buddha eye sees the real; the four eyes see the provisional. This knowing is seeing; this seeing is knowing. In contrast to the prior wisdoms, those wisdoms are coarse; this knowledge and seeing is called subtle.

若得知見中意，不復論五眼。迷者未了，更約眼明麁妙。如肉眼盲閉，何由見色？徒聞人說，起種種想，終非真見。欲令眼開，應須治膜，那得閉眼，執諍何益耶？閉眼想則麁，眼開見則妙。天眼未開，不見障外為麁，修禪定願智之力，能發得淨色，徹障內外，明闇無隔。慧眼未開，常行死逕，假令情想，亦復非實，故為麁；無漏豁發，故稱為妙。諦理明了，故稱妙。法眼未開，差機說法。如身子僻教，滿願穢器，名為麁。破障通無知，分別藥病名之為妙。

> If one attains the middle meaning of knowledge and seeing, one no longer discusses the five eyes. Those confused and not yet clear further clarify coarse and subtle by the eyes. If the flesh eye is blind and closed, how can it see form? Merely hearing people speak, one raises various imaginings and in the end has no true seeing. If one wishes to open the eye, one must treat the film—how could closing the eye and clinging to disputes be of any benefit? Closed‑eye imagining is coarse; open‑eye seeing is subtle. If the heavenly eye is not opened, not seeing beyond obstacles is coarse; cultivating the power of meditative concentration and vow‑wisdom can produce pure form, penetrating inside and outside obstacles, light and darkness without obstruction. If the wisdom eye is not opened, one constantly walks the path of death; even if one imagines, it is not real—therefore coarse. Outflow‑free suddenly arises, therefore called subtle. The truth‑principle is clear, therefore called subtle. If the dharma eye is not opened, one teaches dharma by differing capacities—like Śāriputra’s partial teaching, filling a filthy vessel—this is called coarse. Breaking obstacles and penetrating ignorance, discriminating medicines and disease, is called subtle.

佛眼不開，不見實相。故文云：「二乘之人及新發心者、不退菩薩所不能知」，故四眼皆麁。除諸菩薩眾信力堅固者，以信得入，相似佛眼，能開真佛知見，乃名為妙。諸教多說四眼，或帶四眼說佛眼，是故為麁。今經獨說佛眼，是故為妙。是為待麁為妙也。

> If the Buddha eye is not opened, it does not see real mark. Therefore the text says: "Those of the Two Vehicles and new beginners, and non‑retrogressing bodhisattvas, are unable to know"—therefore the four eyes are all coarse. Except for those bodhisattva assemblies whose faith‑power is firm, entering by faith and having a similar Buddha eye, able to open the true Buddha knowledge‑and‑seeing, it is then called subtle. The various teachings mostly speak of the four eyes, or speak of the Buddha eye together with the four eyes; therefore they are coarse. This sutra alone speaks of the Buddha eye; therefore it is subtle. This is called using the coarse to clarify the subtle.

六、明開麁顯妙者，前十六番智，若不決了，但是麁智；若得決了，悉成妙智。

> Sixth, clarifying opening the coarse and revealing the subtle: the former sixteen kinds of wisdom, if not decisively clarified, are only coarse wisdom; if decisively clarified, all become subtle wisdom.

何者？如妙莊嚴王，先是外道世智，聞《法華經》便得決了，以邪相入正相，於諸見不動而修三十七品，不捨八邪而入八正，即是決於世智，得入妙智。或與五品齊，或與相似齊，或與分得齊，節節有入，義細作(云云)。

> Why? For example, King Wonderful‑Adornment, formerly in non‑Buddhist world wisdom, upon hearing the *Lotus Sutra* immediately attained decisive clarification; he entered the right mark through the wrong mark, was unmoved among various views while cultivating the thirty‑seven factors, and without abandoning the eight wrongs entered the eight rights—this is decisively clarifying world wisdom and entering subtle wisdom. It may be on par with the five grades, or on par with the similar stage, or on par with partial attainment; at each stage there is entry—details are treated finely (and so on).

若五停方便智，乃至通教佛等智，若不決了，即是麁智。今開權顯實，「汝等所行是菩薩道」，來入妙位。須一一將十二番智來入圓妙四智，或入五品、相似、分得等智(云云)。

> If the five‑stopping expedient wisdom up to the Common‑teaching Buddha wisdom are not decisively clarified, they are coarse wisdom. Now opening the provisional and revealing the real—"what you practice is the bodhisattva path"—they come to enter the subtle position. One must bring each of the twelve kinds of wisdom to enter the Perfect subtle four wisdoms, or enter the five grades, the similar, the partial attainment wisdoms, and so on (and so on).

又、決了別教歷別之智，入於妙智。當體即是某位，進入是某位細捒(云云)。

> Again, decisively clarifying the Distinct teaching’s stage‑by‑stage wisdom, it enters subtle wisdom. In its own body it is a certain stage; in advancing it enters another stage—detailed arrangement (and so on).

十六麁智皆成妙智，無麁可待，即是絕待智妙也。

> The sixteen coarse wisdoms all become subtle wisdom; with no coarse to contrast, this is absolute wisdom subtlety.

復次，開麁眼為妙眼者，餘經雖說為五眼，五眼不融，是故為麁。今經決了四眼，令入佛眼。文云：「父母所生眼，遂得清淨。」學大乘者，雖有肉眼，名為佛眼。即是決了肉眼，名為佛眼也。《淨名》云：「世孰有真天眼者，有佛世尊，不以二相見諸佛國。」此即是決了天眼，即是佛眼也。「願得如世尊慧眼第一淨」，即是決了慧眼，能得入妙。決法眼入妙者，邊際智滿是也。四眼融入佛眼，寂而常照，故文云：「決了聲聞法，是諸經之王。」五眼具足成菩提，開佛知見，故稱為妙。

> Furthermore, opening the coarse eyes as subtle eyes: though other sutras speak of five eyes, the five eyes are not fused, therefore coarse. This sutra decisively clarifies the four eyes and has them enter the Buddha eye. The text says: "The eye born from father and mother thereupon becomes pure." Those who study Mahāyāna, though they have the flesh eye, it is called the Buddha eye; this is decisively clarifying the flesh eye and calling it the Buddha eye. The *Vimalakīrti* says: "In the world who has a true heavenly eye? The Buddha World‑Honored One, who does not see Buddha‑lands with dual marks." This is decisively clarifying the heavenly eye as the Buddha eye. "May I attain the foremost purity of the World‑Honored One’s wisdom eye"—this decisively clarifies the wisdom eye, enabling entry into the subtle. Decisively clarifying the dharma eye entering the subtle is the fulfillment of boundary wisdom. The four eyes fuse into the Buddha eye, quiescent yet constantly illuminating; therefore the text says: "Decisively clarifying the śrāvaka dharma, this is the king of all sutras." With the five eyes complete, bodhi is accomplished; opening Buddha knowledge‑and‑seeing, therefore called subtle.
