## ○第二、智妙
# The Second [Subtlety]: Wisdom Subtlety

---

至理玄微，非智莫顯；智能知所，非境不融。境既融妙，智亦稱之，其猶影響矣，故次境說智。

> **Ultimate principle is profound and subtle—without wisdom, it cannot be revealed. Wisdom knows what [is to be known]—without realm, there is no fusion.** The realm being fused and subtle, wisdom also accords with it, just as shadow follows form. Therefore after Realm, we explain Wisdom.

---

## Overview of the Six Topics

智即為二：初、總論諸智，二、對境論智。總智為六：一、數；二、類；三、相；四、照；五、判；六、開。

> Wisdom has two parts: (1) General discussion of the wisdoms, (2) Wisdom discussed in relation to realm. The general [discussion] has six [topics]: (1) **Number**, (2) **Classification**, (3) **Characteristics**, (4) **Illumination**, (5) **Judgment**, (6) **Opening**.

## 二、類 — Classification by Group

二、類者，

> **Classification:**

世智無道，邪計妄執，心行理外，不信不入，故為一。

> **World Wisdom** has no [Buddhist] path—wrong views and false attachments, mental activity outside principle, not believing, not entering. Hence it is one [category].

五停心、四念處，已入初賢佛法氣分，俱是外凡，故為一。

> **Five Stilling-Hearts and Four Mindfulnesses**: having entered the initial stage of worthy Buddha-dharma, both are outer-ordinary. Hence one.

四善根同是內凡，故為一。

> **Four Roots-of-Good**: all are inner-ordinary. Hence one.

四果同見真，故為一。

> **Four Fruits**: all see truth. Hence one.

支佛別相觀能侵習，故為一。

> **Pratyekabuddha**: separate-aspect contemplation can encroach on habitual tendencies. Hence one.

六度緣理智弱、緣事智強，故為一。

> **Six Perfections**: wisdom conditioning principle is weak; wisdom conditioning phenomena is strong. Hence one.

通教方便聲聞體法智勝，故為一。支佛又小勝，故為一。

> **Common Śrāvaka Body-Dharma Wisdom** is superior [to Tripiṭaka]. Hence one. **Common Pratyekabuddha** is slightly superior again. Hence one.

通教菩薩入真方便智，四門遍學，故為一。通教出假菩薩智，正緣俗，故為一。

> **Common Bodhisattva Entry-True**: learns all four gates. Hence one. **Common Exit-Provisional**: properly conditions the conventional. Hence one.

別教十信智，先知中道，勝前劣後，故為一。別教三十心俱是內凡，故為一。十地同是聖智，故為一。

> **Distinct Ten Faiths**: first knows the Middle Way, superior to former, inferior to later. Hence one. **Distinct Thirty Minds**: all inner-ordinary. Hence one. **Ten Grounds**: all sage-wisdom. Hence one.

三藏佛是師位名，勝三乘弟子，故為一。通教佛智，斷惑照機勝，故為一。別教佛智又勝，故為一。

> **Tripiṭaka Buddha**: the teacher position, superior to three-vehicle disciples. Hence one. **Common Buddha**: cutting delusion and illuminating capacity is superior. Hence one. **Distinct Buddha**: yet superior. Hence one.

圓教五品弟子同具煩惱性，能知如來祕密之藏，故為一。六根清淨智隣真，故為一。初住至等覺同破無明，故為一。妙覺佛智無上最尊，故為一。

> **Perfect Five Grades**: all possess the nature of afflictions yet can know the Tathāgata's secret treasury. Hence one. **Six Roots Purified**: neighbors the true. Hence one. **First Abiding to Equal Awakening**: all break ignorance. Hence one. **Wondrous Awakening Buddha Wisdom**: unsurpassed, most honored. Hence one.

如是等隨其類分相似者，或離、或合，判為二十(云云)。

> Thus classifying by type those that are similar—whether separating or combining—**we judge them as twenty**.

---

## 三、辨相 — Characteristics

三、辨相者，

> **Distinguishing Characteristics:**

### World Wisdom (世智)

天竺世智，極至非想。此間所宗，要在忠孝、五行、六藝、天文、地理、醫方、卜相、兵法、貨法、草木千種皆識，禽獸萬品知名。

> In India, world wisdom reaches at most "neither-perception-nor-non-perception." What is valued here [in China] lies in loyalty and filial piety, the five elements, the six arts, astronomy, geography, medicine, divination, military strategy, commerce—knowing a thousand kinds of plants, naming ten thousand kinds of animals.

又塗左割右等無憎愛。獲根本定，發五神通，停河在耳，變釋為羊，納吐風雲，捫摸日月。

> Also [achieving] impartiality like painting left and cutting right without hatred or love. Attaining root concentration, developing the five supernatural powers—stopping rivers in the ear, transforming Indra into a sheep, breathing in and out wind and clouds, touching sun and moon.

法是世間法，定是不動定，慧是不動出。邀名利、增見愛，世心所知，故名世智也。

> The dharmas are worldly dharmas; the concentration is immovable concentration; the wisdom is exiting from immovability. **Seeking fame and profit, increasing views and craving—known by the worldly mind—hence called World Wisdom.**

---

### Four Roots-of-Good (煖、頂、忍、世第一法)

#### Warmth (煖)

煖法緣四諦境生智，伏煩惱，智更增，成十六觀智。

> **Warmth-dharma**: conditioning the realm of four truths, wisdom arises, subduing afflictions; wisdom further increases, becoming the sixteen contemplation-wisdoms.

如火鑽，上下相依，生火燒薪。以有智知有境，能生煖智，令有萎悴。

> It is like a fire-drill—above and below depending on each other, generating fire to burn fuel. **With wisdom knowing realm, one can generate warmth-wisdom, causing [the fuel of] existence to wither.**

尊者瞿沙說：求解脫智火，煖最在初。如火，以煙在初為相。無漏智火亦以煖法在先為相。

> Venerable Ghoṣa said: "Seeking the wisdom-fire of liberation, warmth is at the beginning. Like fire, having smoke at the beginning as its mark—the fire of outflow-free wisdom also has warmth-dharma at the beginning as its mark."

---

#### Summit (頂)

頂法者，色界善根，有動、不動，住、不住，有難、不難，斷、不斷，退、不退。

> **Summit-dharma**: form-realm wholesome roots—movable and immovable, abiding and not abiding, with difficulty and without difficulty, cut and not cut, regressing and not regressing.

就動乃至退者，有二：下者是煖，上是頂。彼不動乃至不退者為二：下者是忍，上者是世第一法。

> Among those movable through regressing, there are two: lower is warmth, upper is summit. Among those immovable through non-regressing, there are two: lower is patience, upper is world-first-dharma.

如山頂之道，人不久住。若無難，必過此到彼；若遇難，即便退還。行者住頂不久，若無難必到忍；有難退還煖。猶如山頂，故名頂。

> **It is like a path on a mountain summit—people do not stay long.** Without difficulty, they necessarily cross to the other side; encountering difficulty, they then retreat. Practitioners at the summit do not stay long—without difficulty, they necessarily reach patience; with difficulty, they retreat to warmth. Like a mountain summit—hence called Summit.

---

#### Patience (忍)

忍法觀者，正觀欲界苦，色、無色界苦...

> **Patience-dharma contemplation**: Correctly contemplating the suffering of the desire realm, form and formless realms...

如是三十二心，是名下忍。行者後時，漸漸減損行及緣...是名中忍。復以一心觀欲界苦，是名上忍。

> Thus thirty-two minds—this is called **lower patience**. Later, the practitioner gradually reduces practices and conditions... this is called **middle patience**. Then with one mind contemplating desire-realm suffering—this is called **upper patience**.

---

#### World-First-Dharma (世第一法)

世第一法者，此心心數法，於餘法為最、為勝、為長、為尊、為上、為妙。

> **World-First-Dharma**: This mind and mental factors, compared to other dharmas, are the most, the superior, the chief, the honored, the uppermost, the subtle.

最勝義是第一義；得妙果是第一義，如高幢頂，更無有上，是第一義。

> The meaning of "most superior" is "ultimate meaning." Attaining the subtle fruit is ultimate meaning—**like the top of a high banner, with nothing higher—this is ultimate meaning.**

---

## Four Wisdoms Illuminating Dependent Origination

二十智照四種十二因緣境者：

> **Twenty Wisdoms illuminating the four types of Twelve Links:**

世智、五停、四念、四果乃至支佛、六度、三藏佛，凡七智，照思議生滅十二因緣境。

> World wisdom, Five Stillings, Four Mindfulnesses, Four Fruits, up to Pratyekabuddha, Six Perfections, Tripiṭaka Buddha—**seven wisdoms in total illuminate the Conceivable Arising-and-Ceasing Twelve Links**.

通教三乘入真方便智、出假智、佛智凡五智，照思議不生不滅十二因緣境。

> Common Teaching's three-vehicle Entry-True Expedient wisdom, Exit-Provisional wisdom, Buddha wisdom—**five wisdoms illuminate the Conceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing Twelve Links**.

別教十信、三十心、十地、佛凡四智，照不思議生滅十二因緣境。

> Distinct Teaching's Ten Faiths, Thirty Minds, Ten Grounds, Buddha—**four wisdoms illuminate the Inconceivable Arising-and-Ceasing Twelve Links**.

圓教四智，照不思議不生不滅十二因緣境。

> Perfect Teaching's **four wisdoms illuminate the Inconceivable Non-Arising-Non-Ceasing Twelve Links**.

---

## 五、明麁妙 — Judging Coarse and Subtle

五、明麁妙者，前十二番智是麁，後八番智為妙。

> **Judging coarse and subtle:** The former twelve types of wisdom are coarse; the latter eight types are subtle.

何者？藏、通等佛，自是無常，亦不說常，彼二乘菩薩何得聞常、信常、修常？是故為麁。

> Why? Tripiṭaka and Common Buddhas are themselves impermanent and do not teach permanence—how could their Two Vehicle and bodhisattva [disciples] hear, believe in, or cultivate permanence? **Hence coarse.**

別教十信初已聞常，信、修於常，尚勝彼佛，何況餘耶？是故為妙。

> **Distinct Teaching Ten Faiths has already heard permanence from the beginning**—believing and cultivating permanence—still surpasses those [Tripiṭaka/Common] Buddhas. How much more the rest! **Hence subtle.**

---

### Distinct Teaching: Three Coarse, One Subtle

又，別教四智，三麁一妙。

> Also, Distinct Teaching's four wisdoms: **three coarse, one subtle**.

地人云：「中道乃是果頭能顯，初心學者仰信此理，如藕絲懸山。」

> The *Dilun* school says: "The Middle Way is revealed only at the fruit-stage. Beginners look up and believe in this principle **like hanging a mountain by a lotus fiber.**"

故說信、行皆非圓意也。故十信智為麁。十住正修空，傍修假、中。十行正修假，傍修中。十迴向始正修中。此中但理，不具諸法，是故皆麁。

> Hence they say faith and practice are not Perfect intention. Hence **Ten Faiths wisdom is coarse**. Ten Abidings primarily cultivate emptiness, secondarily cultivate provisional and middle. Ten Practices primarily cultivate provisional, secondarily middle. Ten Dedications begin primarily cultivating middle. But this middle is only principle, **not containing all dharmas—hence all coarse**.

登地智破無明，見中道，證則為妙。

> **Ground-attaining wisdom breaks ignorance, sees the Middle Way—realization is subtle.**

---

### Perfect Teaching: All Four Subtle

圓教四智皆妙者，如法相說，如說而信，如理而行，始論五品，終竟妙覺，實而非權，是故皆妙。是名待麁智說妙智也。

> **Perfect Teaching's four wisdoms are all subtle:** As the dharma-mark is spoken, so one believes; as principle is, so one practices. Beginning with the Five Grades, ending with Wondrous Awakening—**real and not expedient—hence all subtle.** This is explaining subtle wisdom by contrasting coarse wisdom.

---

## 六、明開麁顯妙 — Opening the Coarse to Reveal the Subtle

六、明開麁顯妙者，前十六番智，若不決了，但是麁智；若得決了，悉成妙智。

> **Opening the coarse to reveal the subtle:** The former sixteen types of wisdom—if not decisively clarified, they are only coarse wisdom. If decisively clarified, **all become subtle wisdom**.

何者？如妙莊嚴王，先是外道世智，聞《法華經》便得決了，以邪相入正相，於諸見不動而修三十七品，不捨八邪而入八正，即是決於世智，得入妙智。

> Why? Like King Wonderful Adornment—formerly possessing non-Buddhist world wisdom, upon hearing the *Lotus Sūtra* he immediately attained decisive clarity. **With wrong marks entering right marks, among all views without moving he cultivated the thirty-seven factors of awakening; not abandoning the eight wrongs, he entered the eight rights.** This is deciding world wisdom, entering subtle wisdom.

---

十六麁智皆成妙智，無麁可待，即是絕待智妙也。

> **All sixteen coarse wisdoms become subtle wisdom. With no coarse to contrast, this is Absolute Wisdom Subtlety.**

---

## Summary: The Architecture of Wisdom Subtlety

| Topic | Content |
|-------|---------|
| **Number** | Twenty wisdoms enumerated |
| **Classification** | Grouped by similarity |
| **Characteristics** | Each wisdom's unique features |
| **Illumination** | Which wisdoms illuminate which realms |
| **Judgment** | Coarse vs. subtle determination |
| **Opening** | All coarse become subtle in the Lotus |

## Footnotes

[^1]: The **Twenty Wisdoms** represent the complete taxonomy of Buddhist wisdom across all four teachings. The first twelve (wisdoms 1-16, minus Perfect) are "coarse" because they lead to impermanent results or partial understanding. The final eight (Perfect wisdoms + parts of Distinct) are "subtle" because they lead to permanent realization of the Middle Way.
