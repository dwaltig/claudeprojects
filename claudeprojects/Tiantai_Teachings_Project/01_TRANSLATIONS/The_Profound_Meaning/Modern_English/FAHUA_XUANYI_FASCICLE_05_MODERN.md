# The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra

## Fascicle 5: Three Dharmas Subtlety (Fifth Subtlety)

**Modern English Version (Practitioners Edition)**

---

## Overview

This is the dharma in which the subtle positions abide. The Three Dharmas are the Three Tracks: patterns that guide the One Vehicle. Though named as three, they are one Great Vehicle dharma.

This fascicle follows seven topics:

1. General explanation of the Three Tracks
2. Specific explanation of the Three Tracks
3. Judging coarse and subtle
4. Opening the coarse to reveal the subtle
5. Explaining beginning and end
6. Classifying the Three Dharmas
7. Four Siddhantas analysis

### Ten Intentions Clarifying the Perfect Position

Before the Three Tracks are explained, the text frames the Perfect Position with ten intentions:

1. The name itself already carries the perfect meaning.
2. Many stages are named, but the principle remains equal.
3. How cutting and subduing uproot affliction.
4. How function benefits each capacity.
5. When provisional displays give way to the wondrous.
6. Why different position structures arise to match listeners.
7. How provisional structures fade once the real is revealed.
8. How the coarse is opened to show the subtle.
9. Why the scripture cites earlier teachings.
10. How the beginning and end of the wondrous position are one.

## 1) General Explanation of the Three Tracks

The Three Tracks are:

1. True Nature Track
2. Contemplative Illumination Track
3. Resource Accomplishment Track

The One Vehicle is also called Ultimate Truth, Ultimate Emptiness, and Tathagatagarbha. These are three names for one reality. They are not fixed as three, and not fixed as one. Like the three dots of the Siddham letter I, they are neither stacked nor parallel. They intercontain.

### How the Three Tracks Link to Earlier Subtleties

- All truths discussed before are the mark of the True Nature Track.
- All wisdoms discussed before are the mark of the Contemplative Illumination Track.
- All practices discussed before are the mark of the Resource Accomplishment Track.
- All positions discussed before are the fruits of cultivating these three tracks.

## 2) The Perfect Teaching's Three Dharmas

### True Nature Track

True means not false. Nature means not changing. This is the constant right cause, the teacher of all Buddhas. All beings are already of the One Vehicle. Sentient beings are precisely the mark of Nirvana. Nirvana is precisely birth-and-death. There is no need to extinguish anything outside reality.

### Contemplative Illumination Track

Contemplative Illumination points to true nature: quiescent yet always illuminating. This is Ultimate Emptiness.

### Resource Accomplishment Track

Resource Accomplishment points to the true-nature Dharma-Realm, which contains and stores all practices and implements. This is Tathagatagarbha.

### Wish-Fulfilling Jewel Image

The three tracks are like a wish-fulfilling jewel with light and treasure. Light and treasure are not the jewel, yet not separate from the jewel. The tracks are likewise one, non-one, and neither-one-nor-non-one.

### The Three Obstacles

If one is confused about the three tracks, they appear as three obstacles:

| Track Confused | Obstacle | What It Blocks |
|---|---|---|
| Resource Accomplishment | Dust-and-sand | Innumerable dharma gates |
| Contemplative Illumination | View-and-thought | Liberation |
| True Nature | Root ignorance | Realization of Buddha-nature |

When these obstacles are penetrated, the tracks are revealed:

- Penetrate dust-and-sand: Resource Accomplishment is revealed.
- Penetrate view-and-thought: Contemplative Illumination is revealed.
- Penetrate root ignorance: True Nature is revealed.

Revealed, they are named as the Three Virtues: Dharma-body, Prajna, and Liberation. The Dharma-body is the vehicle-body; Prajna and Liberation are its adornments and implements.

## 3) Classifying the Three Dharmas

Names vary with conditions, but the meaning is one. The text groups ten common triads under the Three Tracks.

| Category | True Nature | Contemplative Illumination | Resource Accomplishment |
|---|---|---|---|
| Three Paths | Suffering Path | Affliction Path | Karma Path |
| Three Consciousnesses | Amala | Alaya | Adana |
| Three Buddha-Natures | Right Cause | Understanding Cause | Condition Cause |
| Three Prajnas | Reality-Mark | Contemplative | Literary |
| Three Bodhis | Reality-Mark | Real Wisdom | Skillful Means |
| Three Great Vehicles | Principle Vehicle | Following Vehicle | Attainment Vehicle |
| Three Bodies | Dharma-body | Reward-body | Response-body |
| Three Nirvanas | Nature-purity | Perfect-purity | Skillful-purity |
| One-Essence Three Jewels | Dharma | Buddha | Sangha |
| Three Virtues | Dharma-body | Prajna | Liberation |

### Example: Type-Penetrating the Three Paths

- Suffering Path is True Nature: birth-and-death is already the Dharma-body.
- Affliction Path is Contemplative Illumination: illumination depends on delusion as its field.
- Karma Path is Resource Accomplishment: good and evil are the resources that give rise to practice.

### Example: Type-Penetrating the Three Buddha-Natures

- Right-Cause Nature aligns with True Nature Track.
- Understanding-Cause Nature aligns with Contemplative Illumination.
- Condition-Cause Nature aligns with Resource Accomplishment.

## 4) Judging Coarse and Subtle

The earlier enumerations can be read in two ways. Seen from the Three Tracks, what appears coarse becomes subtle. The True Nature Track is the principle side, the Contemplative Illumination Track is the interpretive side, and the Resource Accomplishment Track is the practice and result side. When these three are seen as one, the divisions among vehicles and stages collapse into a single subtle unity.

## 5) Opening the Coarse to Reveal the Subtle

The Perfect Teaching does not discard earlier structures. It opens them. Names, stages, vows, and practices remain in place, but they are revealed as expressions of the three tracks. The coarse becomes the doorway to the subtle.

---

## 6) Explaining Beginning and End

The beginning already contains the end. The first arousing of mind includes the ten suchnesses, which already belong to the three tracks. What appears as a sequence of seeds, stages, and powers is the unfolding of what was present from the start. The end simply manifests what the beginning already held.

## 7) Four Siddhantas Analysis

The Four Siddhantas are: Worldly, For-Each-Person, Therapeutic, and First Principle. They respond to different needs, but all participate in the three tracks.

- Worldly Siddhanta: introduces broad patterns for beginners.
- For-Each-Person Siddhanta: adapts to individual capacities.
- Therapeutic Siddhanta: prescribes remedies to cut affliction.
- First Principle Siddhanta: points directly to Ultimate Truth.

The first three are provisional and breakable; the First Principle is unbreakable and subtle. The Perfect Teaching keeps all four, while revealing their unity in the Three Tracks.

## Notes

- The Three Tracks correspond to reality realized (True Nature), wisdom realizing (Contemplative Illumination), and practice enabling realization (Resource Accomplishment). They are one reality spoken from three angles.
