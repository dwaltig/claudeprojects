# The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra

## Fascicle 7: Fundamental and Trace

**Modern English Version (Practitioners Edition)**

## Introduction: The Two Halves

The Ten Trace Subtleties are the first half of the jewel: the Buddha’s historical manifestation. Now we enter the Ten Fundamental Subtleties: the Buddha’s eternal nature revealed in the Lifespan chapter. This is the “temporal collapse” where the Buddha’s enlightenment is shown as beginningless, and the historical narrative is a skillful projection for teaching.

## Part One: Six Meanings of Fundamental and Trace

1. **Principle as Fundamental:** The Reality-Mark is Fundamental. Everything else is Trace.
2. **Principle-and-Event as Fundamental:** Both principle and event are Fundamental; teaching about them is Trace.
3. **Teaching as Fundamental:** The teaching itself is Fundamental; practice based on it is Trace, like footprints that lead back to the place.
4. **Body as Fundamental:** The realized body is Fundamental; its functions are Trace.
5. **Real Attainment as Fundamental:** Actual attainment is Fundamental; provisional bestowal is Trace.
6. **Revealed-Now as Fundamental:** What is revealed now is Fundamental; what was said before is Trace.

| # | Fundamental | Trace |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Reality-Mark principle | Everything else |
| 2 | Principle and event | Teaching about them |
| 3 | Teaching | Practice based on teaching |
| 4 | Body/Substance | Function/Use |
| 5 | Real attainment | Provisional bestowal |
| 6 | What is revealed now | What was said before |

## Part Two: The Ten Fundamental Subtleties

Order matters: cause, fruit, land, resonance, powers, exposition, retinue, Nirvana, lifespan, benefits.

### 1) Fundamental Cause Subtlety

The original arousing of the bodhi mind and the first perfect cause. Later events in history are trace causes, not the original. The Lotus removes these traces to clear doubt and return to the beginningless cause.

### 2) Fundamental Fruit Subtlety

The original fruit is the Buddha’s attainment from immeasurable time. It is not limited to a specific place or a recent awakening. This is the fundamental fruit.

### 3) Fundamental Land Subtlety

Having the fundamental fruit implies a fundamental land. The Buddha has always taught in this world, but not as a mere historical scene. This is the fundamental land: the place where the eternal Buddha teaches.

### 4) Fundamental Resonance Subtlety

From that original attainment, the Buddha’s compassion, vows, and samadhi function without interruption. Readiness and response interconnect without effort. This is fundamental resonance.

### 5) Fundamental Supernatural Powers

Original powers arise naturally from the Middle, not from effort. Transformation is effortless and constant.

### 6) Fundamental Dharma-Exposition

The original turning of the Dharma-wheel is not a single historical sermon. It is the ongoing exposition of the eternal Buddha.

### 7) Fundamental Retinue

The original disciples are not just those present in history. The Buddha says those who appear later are already his children. The retinue is timeless.

### 8) Fundamental Nirvana

Nirvana is not a final disappearance. It is the original reality where extinction and non-extinction interpenetrate.

### 9) Fundamental Lifespan

The lifespan is limitless. The Buddha’s life is not measured by time but by the timeless Reality-Mark.

### 10) Fundamental Benefits

Benefits flow from the original Buddha through karma, vows, powers, and responses. They are not bound to one time or place.

## Near Benefits and the Tenfold Sequence

The text describes near benefits that arise when the Dharma is proclaimed from the Nirvana-stage. It then lays out a tenfold sequence of benefits, ranging from relief of suffering to the full realization of the real land. The point is that the Lotus gathers all benefits into one whole: coarse and subtle merge, and the Buddha’s response reaches every capacity.

---

## Benefit Questions and the Three Truths

The ten benefits are necessary because each level cuts a deeper layer of ignorance. The three truths are already present in every realm, so the Lotus does not create a new reality. It reveals the reality already woven into every moment of practice.

## Fundamental and Trace Are Inconceivably One

Fundamental and Trace are different, yet not two. The Trace arises from the Fundamental. By following the Trace, we arrive at the Fundamental. Ultimately, they are non-dual.

## Notes

- The Ten Fundamental Subtleties parallel the Ten Trace Subtleties but reveal the eternal Buddha rather than the historical display.
