# The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra

## Fascicle 6: Resonance Subtlety (Sixth Subtlety)

**Modern English Version (Practitioners Edition)**

---

## Overview

The earlier subtleties are the Perfect Causes. The Three Dharmas are the Perfect Fruit. Fruit-wisdom is quiet yet illuminating. When a stimulus appears, it must respond. That is why Resonance Subtlety follows.

This fascicle treats six topics:

1. Names of readiness and response
2. Marks of readiness and response
3. Sameness and difference
4. Correspondence
5. Coarse and subtle
6. Mind contemplation

## 1) Names of Readiness and Response

### Readiness (Stimulus)

Readiness has three meanings:

1. **Readiness as subtle:** a quiet stirring that precedes change.
2. **Readiness as hinge or gate:** beings pivot on the sage’s compassion.
3. **Readiness as suitability:** what needs uprooting suits compassion; what needs joy suits kindness.

### Response

Response has three meanings:

1. **Going-to:** when readiness stirs, the sage goes and good arises.
2. **Matching:** buyer and seller correspond; readiness and response meet.
3. **Responding:** compassion answers what is suitable.

---

## 2) Marks of Readiness and Response

### Good and Evil as Readiness

Readiness includes both good and evil. From the lowest beings up to Equal Awakening, good and evil interlink. That interlinking is itself readiness.

### Three Times of Readiness

Readiness exists across past, present, and future. Generally all three are readiness. Specifically, **future good and evil** are primary, because the work of response is to uproot future evil and produce future good.

## 3) The Four Sentences of Resonance

| Type | Readiness | Response | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hidden / Hidden | Past good | Hidden benefit | No visible sign, yet real help |
| Hidden / Manifest | Past good | Visible meeting | Past causes ripen into present benefit |
| Manifest / Manifest | Present effort | Visible response | Practice evokes clear signs |
| Manifest / Hidden | Present effort | Hidden benefit | No visible sign, yet benefit accrues |

**Practical effect:** every bow and raised hand is not wasted. If there is no visible response, do not fall into wrong views. Hidden benefit still works.

### The Thirty-Six Sentences

Readiness can be hidden, manifest, both, or neither. Hidden points to the past, manifest to the present, both to past-and-present, and neither to the future. Each of these has four response patterns, and responses mirror this structure. These combinations yield thirty-six resonance sentences. The point: response can be working even when it is unseen.

---

## 4) Coarse and Subtle

- **Nine-realm readiness is coarse; Buddha-realm readiness is subtle.**
- Tripitaka and Common Teaching responses are intentional and effortful, like a painting made by hand.
- Distinct and Perfect responses are unforced and natural, like a clear mirror reflecting whatever appears.

**Mirror image:** the moon does not descend and the waters do not rise, yet the reflection appears everywhere at once. This is inconceivable, subtle response.

---

## 5) Opening the Coarse to Reveal the Subtle

The Lotus returns the immeasurable to the one. Three grasses and two trees grow from one ground and are moistened by one rain. The wise understand: what appears as different is one source. Thus **nine-realm readiness is Buddha-realm readiness**, and the responses of all sages are subtle responses. Coarse is opened into subtle.

---

## 6) Mind Contemplation

Zhiyi turns to the mind itself. Readiness and response are not only external events; they are the mind’s own habits. Observe how **love** (attachment) and **view** (conceptual grasping) arise and pass. When these are seen clearly, the same energies that once fed defilement become the field of wisdom. This is the integration point where stimulus and response become one observing mind.

# Supernatural Powers Subtlety (Seventh Subtlety)

## Overview

After resonance, the text turns to transformative function that benefits others. These are the **Three Wheels** of transformation: body, speech, and mind.

### The Three Wheels

- **Body wheel:** roaming in the world to appear where needed.
- **Speech wheel:** expounding the Dharma.
- **Mind wheel:** the wisdom that makes the other two possible.

### The Six Powers

1. Heavenly eye
2. Heavenly ear
3. Knowing others’ minds
4. Knowing past lives
5. Transforming the body
6. Outflow-free powers

Supernatural means natural mind; powers means wisdom-nature. When obstructions are cleared, wisdom-nature acts without blockage.

### Real Transformation vs Illusion

Illusions only deceive the eye. True powers actually transform dharmas. Like water freezing or metal melting, the change is real when wisdom-nature is present.

### Powers Across Teachings

| Teaching | Power Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Ghosts and spirits | Karmic retribution | Born with powers |
| Humans | Medicine-induced | Through herbs or methods |
| Externalists | Root meditation | From basic dhyana |
| Tripitaka | Abandonment-based | From eight liberations |
| Common Teaching | Body-dharma based | Instant emptiness insight |
| Distinct Teaching | Sequential | Pre-ground and ground-entry |
| Perfect Teaching | Non-intentional | Natural Middle-way powers |

### Perfect Teaching Powers

Perfect powers arise from the Middle. All six sense roots are wisdom in mutual function. These powers do not depend on mundane meditation. They arise naturally from the Reality-Mark and are undiminished.

### Coarse and Subtle Powers

- **Coarse powers** are effortful, like a painting made by hand.
- **Subtle powers** are natural, like a clear mirror reflecting forms.

### Powers in the Five Flavors

| Flavor | Powers |
|---|---|
| Milk | One coarse, one subtle |
| Curds | One coarse only |
| Fresh Butter | Three coarse, one subtle |
| Clarified Butter | Two coarse, one subtle |
| Ghee (Lotus) | One subtle only |

The Lotus uses powers only for the subtle.

### Ten Auspicious Signs

The opening chapter’s ten signs each reflect a subtlety:

1. Ground purified: Realm
2. Light from brow: Wisdom
3. Entering samadhi: Practice
4. Flowers from heaven: Position
5. Fragrant wind: Vehicle
6. Doubt and vision of many lands: Resonance
7. Sixfold quake: Supernatural powers
8. Heavenly drum and Dharma: Teaching
9. Beings rejoicing: Retinue
10. Buddha-children practicing: Benefits

### Opening Coarse to Reveal Subtle

The Lotus does not merely add subtle to coarse; it removes coarse by clarifying it. All powers become one subtle Buddha-matter.

# Teaching Subtlety (Eighth Subtlety)

Zhiyi proceeds in order:

1. Twelve canonical designations (sutra, verse, parable, analysis, and so on).
2. Four naming patterns and the structure of the compendia.
3. Five flavors as the coarse ordering of earlier teachings.
4. Lotus as opening and combining that reveals the one Middle.

All names point to the Reality-Mark rather than separate truths.

---

# Retinue Subtlety (Ninth Subtlety)

The retinue is read as readiness-response in stages:

1. Hearing and trust form the outer retinue.
2. Practice and discipline form the inner retinue.
3. Love-mind and view-mind are examined as roots of clinging.
4. Karmic affinity and vow convert hostility into kinship.

The true retinue is internal: heirs formed by the Perfect Teaching.

---

# Merits and Benefits (Tenth Subtlety)

Benefits are ordered in four layers:

1. Buddha’s intent: why benefits arise.
2. Correct proclamation: how benefits are triggered.
3. Propagation: how benefits spread.
4. Mind contemplation: how benefits are internalized.

Zhiyi then traces ten levels of benefit: relief at the fruit level, transformation at the cause level, samadhi powers for hearers, middle-way purification, gradual conversions through the vehicles, and finally the consummate land beyond birth and death. Each level cuts a deeper defilement so the Dharma can meet every capacity, from coarse duty to final realization.

### The Three Cycles of Benefit

Benefit is not a one-time reward. It is a cycle that spans lifetimes, with three phases:

1. **Root Benefit (Sowing the seed):** The Buddha plants the One Vehicle seed through an encounter, a word, or a gesture. Even if it is ignored or rejected, the seed is not lost.
2. **Ripening Benefit (Maturing the growth):** The earlier teachings moisten the seed. Provisional teachings weed afflictions and grow capacity through time.
3. **Release Benefit (Harvesting the fruit):** The Lotus opens and combines all prior efforts, revealing that even coarse struggles were part of subtle ripening.

This prevents a narrow idea of benefit as only immediate peace. A difficult life can be the ripening phase. Whether one believes or slanders, the seed is planted. Whether one progresses or regresses, the Buddha’s response does not cease.

## Notes

- The Four Sentences of resonance explain why sincere practice may show no visible results while still bearing real benefit.
