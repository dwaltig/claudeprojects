### 1) Why Zhiyi Matters (Guanding’s Preface)

When the Dharma came east, how many people could understand the Buddha Vehicle without even hearing a lecture?
Even if someone awakened, could they enter samadhi and gain dharani?
Even with concentration and wisdom, could they teach in the capital?
Even if their assemblies flourished, could they dismiss their students and live in seclusion?
Even while living quietly, could they be invited to serve as National Preceptor to two dynasties?
Even if honored by emperors, could they teach the *Renwang Prajnaparamita Sutra* in the great hall?
Even if proclaiming the Dharma, could they receive the ruler’s three prostrations?
Even if a ruler of ten thousand chariots knelt, could a hundred officials praise them with snapping fingers?
Even with monks and laypeople attentive, could they awaken to the Perfect Meaning of the Lotus Sutra?
Even if they grasped the Sutra’s meaning, could they teach without leaning on words, pouring forth the Dharma day and night?

Only Master Zhiyi had all these virtues.

### 2) Guanding’s Personal Testimony

I, Guanding, first heard the teachings in Jianye. Later in Jiangling, I received the *Profound Meaning*. In my later years, I returned to Mount Tiantai only to find the “Crane Grove” (a traditional way of saying the Master had passed away).

I traveled back and forth between Jing and Yang--nearly ten thousand li--gathering teachings from before and after. I only heard the full exposition once.
Even what I heard, I did not fully understand. Rolling and unrolling the text, studying and contemplating, I felt its depth and height. Yet I mourned my shallow connection--unable to ask again, with no place to inquire--like a calf longing for milk.

I feared these words might be lost. Future generations would suffer if they vanished.
The *Nirvana Sutra* speaks of inscribing the Dharma on trees and stones; this Sutra speaks of planting seeds in fields and villages. Following the sacred texts, I wrote them down to transmit them: the *Profound Meaning* and the *Textual Commentary*, each in ten fascicles.

Some passages use sutras and treatises to accord with this profound teaching. Others list different masters’ views and show they are not Perfect. Future practitioners will know the Gate of Sweet Dew is here.

### 3) The “King’s Preface” -- Six Lotus Metaphors

#### What “Wonderful Dharma” Means

- **Wonderful** means the inconceivable.
- **Dharma** is the Dharma of the Ten Dharma-Realms, Ten Suchnesses, and Provisional and Real.
- **Lotus** is a metaphor for Provisional and Real.

Because the Wonderful Dharma is hard to grasp, the Lotus is used as a clear image.

#### The Six Metaphors (Three + Three)

**Trace Gate (three metaphors):**  
1) **For the sake of the real, provide the provisional.**  
2) **Open the provisional, reveal the real.**  
3) **Abolish the provisional, establish the real.**

**Fundamental Gate (three metaphors):**  
1) **From the fundamental, the trace descends.**  
2) **Open the trace, reveal the fundamental.**  
3) **Abolish the trace, establish the fundamental.**

#### The Result

The Lotus metaphor does this:
- Sweeps away rigid attachment to the “Conjured City.”
- Breaks stagnation in the “Grass Hut.”
- Opens the Provisional and reveals the Real.
- Gathers small practices into the One Vehicle.
- Gives prediction to beings of all capacities.

It also reveals the Buddha’s original ground.
Thus the path grows and birth-and-death diminishes. The practitioner’s stage draws near to Great Awakening.

---

### 4) Guanding’s Commentary on the Preface

The preface explains the Sutra’s profound meaning.
The heart of that meaning is Trace and Fundamental.

The six metaphors map to the Five Chapters:
- **Name** → “Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower.”
- **Substance** → Revealing the Reality-Mark.
- **Essence** → Returning to the One Vehicle.
- **Function** → Sweeping away the Conjured City.
- **Teaching** → The complete transformation period.

The text is concise, but the meaning is complete.

---


### 1) The Five Chapters

1. **Interpreting the Name**  
2. **Discerning the Substance**  
3. **Clarifying the Essence**  
4. **Discussing the Function**  
5. **Classifying the Teaching**

These five are used in two ways:
- **General**: applies to all sutras.
- **Particular**: applies specifically to this Sutra.

The general explanation uses **seven shared interpretations**:
1) Establishing the chapters  
2) Citing evidence  
3) Demonstrating the arising  
4) Opening and combining  
5) Critical discrimination  
6) Observing the mind  
7) Reconciling differences

#### What Each Interpretation Builds

- **Establishing chapters** → faith (a stable anchor for the path).  
- **Citing evidence** → faith.  
- **Demonstrating arising** → concentration.  
- **Opening/combining, discrimination, reconciling** → wisdom.  
- **Observing the mind** → vigor.

These five minds become the Five Faculties and open the Three Gates of Liberation.

---

### 2) Interpreting the Name

#### A) Establishing
Names open what is profound and guide beginners toward the ultimate. Names point to the Dharma so beings can approach it.

#### B) Distinguishing Coarse and Wonderful

- If the Three Truths are separated and sequential → **coarse**.
- If the Three Truths are perfectly interfused → **wonderful**.

This Wonderful Truth is originally present. The Buddha knows it but does not teach it too soon, because beings could reject it and fall into the lower paths.

#### The Four-Step Progression (CBETA sequence)

These four steps correspond to the first four periods (Huayan, Agama, Vaipulya, Prajna):\n\n1) **Huayan** sets up integrated and non-integrated, but those of lesser capacity do not hear it.  \n2) **Agama** establishes only the non-integrated; the great do not use it.  \n3) **Vaipulya** uses the integrated to shame attachment to the non-integrated.  \n4) **Prajna** lets the small rely on the integrated and the great move into it.

These are all skillful means. The Lotus sets aside the non-integrated and speaks only the integrated--this is the Buddha’s original intent.

#### C) Concluding
- *Avatamsaka* **includes** the One Vehicle alongside the separate vehicles.  
- *Tripitaka* **teaches only** the separate vehicles.  
- *Vaipulya* **contrasts** Great and Small.  
- *Prajna* **carries** the Three while revealing the One.  
- The *Lotus* does **not** mix, contrast, or carry--it is **exclusive** (pure) in stating the One Vehicle.

#### D) The Lotus Metaphor
Other flowers are coarse. The Lotus is unique because it already includes the fruit when the flower appears. It points to a Dharma where Provisional and Real are one.

---

### 3) Discerning the Substance

The Substance is the Reality-Mark.

Many interpretations are rejected because they are too broad or only partial.
Zhiyi keeps the Buddha’s own view: **the Reality-Mark is the true Substance.**

He supports this with passages from the Lotus and related sutras:
- The Buddha emits light to reveal the Reality-Mark.  
- Only Buddha with Buddha can fully fathom it.  
- Opening the expedient gate reveals it.

---

### 4) Clarifying the Essence

Essence is **Buddha’s own cause and fruit**--the path and its full realization.

It is the net’s main cord: lift the cord and all the mesh follows.

---

### 5) Discussing the Function

Function is the Sutra’s power to **break doubt and generate faith**.

This happens through the Buddha’s wisdom:
- **Real Wisdom** clarifies the Reality-Mark.  
- **Provisional Wisdom** guides beings into it.

---


This fascicle teaches you how to read the Lotus in a living way:
- It shows **why the Buddha teaches in stages**.
- It shows **what is ultimately being revealed**.
- It shows **how the One Vehicle gathers everything**.

If you hold that sequence, the rest of the text becomes clear.

## Fascicle 2 (Modern English for Practitioners)

### 1) The Three Meanings of Cause

Cause has three meanings:

1) **Breadth of substance**: One Dharma-Realm contains nine Dharma-Realms.  
2) **Height of position**: The nine Dharma-Realms are precisely the Buddha Dharma-Realm.  
3) **Length of function**: The Ten Dharma-Realms are precisely emptiness, provisional, and Middle.

So: one is three, three is one. Not separate, not flat, not singular. That is why it is called **Wonderful**.

### 2) The Three Meanings of Fruit

Fruit also has three meanings:

1) **Breadth of substance**: It pervades all places.  
2) **Height of position**: Buddhahood was attained long ago, beyond ordinary time.  
3) **Length of function**: From the Fundamental, the Trace descends, benefiting past, present, and future.

Together, these are the **six meanings of cause and fruit**. This is different from other sutras. That is why it is called **Wonderful**.

---


The Five Flavors show how cause-and-fruit are taught in stages:

- **Milk (Avatamsaka)**: one coarse, one wonderful.  
- **Curds (Tripitaka)**: only coarse.  
- **Fresh Butter (Vaipulya)**: three coarse, one wonderful.  
- **Clarified Butter (Prajna)**: two coarse, one wonderful.  
- **Ghee (Lotus)**: only wonderful.

In the Lotus, the wonderful cause and wonderful fruit stand alone and complete.

---


When you look at your own mind:

- If it does **not** contain the minds of beings and the Buddha, that is **narrow substance**.  
- If it **does**, that is **broad substance**.

If your mind is **not equal** to the Buddha’s mind, that is **low position**.  
If it **is equal**, that is **high position**.

If these minds are **not** precisely emptiness, provisional, and Middle, that is **short function**.  
If they **are**, that is **long function**.

#### The Four Unities

1) **Unity of principle**: Ten Dharma-Realms inside one Dharma-Realm.  
2) **Unity of teaching**: Five Flavors are one teaching.  
3) **Unity of practice**: Observing the mind is the direct practice.  
4) **Unity of person**: Six Stages of Identity unfold from that one mind.

The **Six Stages of Identity** are:  
- **Principle** (the truth is already present),  
- **Name** (you can name it),  
- **Practice** (you train it),  
- **Resemblance** (you begin to embody it),  
- **Partial realization** (genuine awakening begins),  
- **Ultimate realization** (full Buddhahood).

---


Master Nanyue names three:

1) **Sentient Being Dharma**  
2) **Buddha Dharma**  
3) **Mind Dharma**

### 1) Sentient Being Dharma is Wonderful

The Lotus shows that the **five eyes** can arise in sentient beings.  
The *Nirvana Sutra* and *Prajna* confirm this.

**CBETA order of proof:**  
- Lotus eye-passages → Nirvana eye-language → Prajna “all dharmas tend toward the eye.”

The conclusion: **the Buddha’s knowledge and vision is already stored in beings**.

### 2) Buddha Dharma is Wonderful

The Buddha says: “My Dharma is subtle and hard to know.”

- **Real Wisdom**: reveals the Reality-Mark.  
- **Provisional Wisdom**: guides beings into it.

Only a Buddha fully knows this. Therefore **Buddha Dharma is Wonderful**.

### 3) Mind Dharma is Wonderful

Mind holds the whole field:

- The Lotus: peaceful practices and the single moment of joy.  
- The Samantabhadra Contemplation: “Mind is empty; sins and merits have no master.”  
- The Vimalakirti: “Contemplate the body’s Reality-Mark; the Buddha is also like this.”  
- The Avatamsaka: “Mind, Buddha, and beings are not different.”

Therefore **Mind Dharma is Wonderful**.

---


The Lotus lists ten suchnesses:

- mark, nature, substance, power, function, cause, condition, effect, retribution, ultimate equality.

Zhiyi reads them in **three turns**:

1) **“The mark is suchness … retribution is suchness.”**  
2) **“Suchness of mark … suchness of retribution.”**  
3) **“The mark is thus … the retribution is thus.”**

#### The Three Truths inside the Three Readings

- If everything is called “suchness,” that is **Emptiness**.  
- If each mark is named in its own way, that is **Provisional**.  
- If “thus” is the Reality-Mark, that is **Middle**.

So: **Emptiness, Provisional, and Middle are mutually inclusive**.
These are not three separate passes through the text. They are **simultaneous** in every mark and every detail.

---


The Ten Dharma-Realms explain how Provisional and Real inter-contain:

1) All ten depend on the Dharma-Realm.  
2) They differ by cause and effect, ordinary and sage.  
3) Each one is precisely the Dharma-Realm itself.

This yields **one hundred realms and one thousand suchnesses**.

To reach the full Tiantai structure, these are seen across **three realms of existence**:  
1) **Sentient beings**,  
2) **The five aggregates**,  
3) **The lands where experience appears**.  
This completes the foundation for **three thousand realms in one moment of thought**.

The Buddha alone fully knows this, because sentient beings can look coarse yet carry ripened good, or look good yet carry ripened evil. This is why **Sentient Being Dharma is Wonderful**.

---


Zhiyi recognizes two kinds:

1) **Relative Wonderful**: contrasts half vs. full, small vs. great.  
2) **Absolute Wonderful**: nothing to contrast; everything is already Wonderful.

The Lotus uses both, but always returns to **Absolute Wonderful**.

---


This fascicle teaches a three-level move:

1) **See the structure** (cause/fruit, five flavors, ten suchnesses).  
2) **See the mind** (your mind already holds the Dharma-Realm).  
3) **See the unity** (all dharmas point to the Reality-Mark).

Observing the mind is the bridge. Without it, Ten Suchnesses are just numbers. With it, they become the texture of your current experience.
When that unity is clear, “Wonderful” is no longer a label. It becomes how you live and practice.

### Part 1: Wisdom Subtlety (Second Subtlety)

The ultimate principle is deep and subtle. Without wisdom, it cannot be revealed. Wisdom knows what is to be known; without a realm to know, there is no fusion. Because the realm is subtle, wisdom must match it, like a shadow follows a form. That is why Wisdom follows Realm in the sequence.

#### Overview of the Six Topics

Wisdom is discussed in two ways: (1) Wisdom in general, (2) Wisdom in relation to realm. The general discussion has six topics:

1. Number
2. Classification
3. Characteristics
4. Illumination
5. Judgment
6. Opening (coarse to subtle)

#### 1) The Number: Twenty Wisdoms

These twenty wisdoms move from common to complete:

| # | Wisdom | Teaching |
|---|--------|----------|
| 1 | World Wisdom | Mundane |
| 2 | Five Stillings and Four Mindfulnesses | Tripitaka |
| 3 | Four Roots of Good | Tripitaka |
| 4 | Four Fruits | Tripitaka |
| 5 | Pratyekabuddha Wisdom | Tripitaka |
| 6 | Six Perfections | Tripitaka |
| 7 | Tripitaka Shravaka Body-Dharma | Shared |
| 8 | Shared Pratyekabuddha | Shared |
| 9 | Shared Bodhisattva Entry-True Expedient | Shared |
| 10 | Shared Bodhisattva Exit-Provisional | Shared |
| 11 | Distinct Ten Faiths | Distinct |
| 12 | Distinct Thirty Minds | Distinct |
| 13 | Distinct Ten Grounds | Distinct |
| 14 | Tripitaka Buddha Wisdom | Tripitaka |
| 15 | Shared Teaching Buddha Wisdom | Shared |
| 16 | Distinct Teaching Buddha Wisdom | Distinct |
| 17 | Perfect Five Grades of Disciples | Perfect |
| 18 | Six Roots Purified | Perfect |
| 19 | First Abiding to Equal Awakening | Perfect |
| 20 | Wondrous Awakening | Perfect |

#### 2) Classification by Group

- World Wisdom: outside the path, dominated by wrong views and attachment.
- Five Stillings and Four Mindfulnesses: both are outer-ordinary.
- Four Roots of Good: inner-ordinary.
- Four Fruits: all see truth.
- Pratyekabuddha: separate-aspect contemplation.
- Six Perfections: weak in principle, strong in phenomena.
- Shared Shravaka and Shared Pratyekabuddha: higher than Tripitaka.
- Shared Bodhisattva Entry-True and Exit-Provisional: learn all four gates and properly condition the conventional.
- Distinct Ten Faiths: first contact with the Middle, higher than before, lower than later.
- Distinct Thirty Minds: inner-ordinary.
- Distinct Ten Grounds: sage-wisdom.
- Tripitaka, Shared, and Distinct Buddha Wisdoms: each surpasses the former.
- Perfect stages: from Five Grades to Wondrous Awakening, all are fully complete.

Thus, by grouping similar types and separating dissimilar ones, we count twenty.

#### 3) Distinguishing Characteristics

**World Wisdom**

Worldly wisdom can reach refined concentration and even supernatural abilities, but it is still driven by fame, profit, views, and craving. That is why it is called world wisdom.

**Four Roots of Good**

- **Warmth:** Wisdom begins to burn away affliction, like a fire drill that finally catches.
- **Summit:** Like reaching a mountain peak, one does not stay long; a small obstacle can cause retreat.
- **Patience:** Gradual endurance of the truths of suffering across the realms, deepening step by step.
- **World-First Dharma:** The most superior mind, like the top of a banner with nothing higher.

#### 4) Illumination: Four Wisdoms Illuminate Four Types of Twelve Links

1. Seven wisdoms (World Wisdom through Tripitaka Buddha) illuminate **conceivable arising-and-ceasing**.
2. Five shared wisdoms illuminate **conceivable non-arising and non-ceasing**.
3. Four distinct wisdoms illuminate **inconceivable arising-and-ceasing**.
4. Four perfect wisdoms illuminate **inconceivable non-arising and non-ceasing**.

#### 5) Judging Coarse and Subtle

- The first twelve wisdoms are coarse; the latter eight are subtle.
- Tripitaka and Shared Buddhas are impermanent and do not teach permanence, so their disciples cannot fully cultivate permanence. Hence coarse.
- Distinct Ten Faiths hear permanence from the start, so they surpass the Tripitaka and Shared wisdoms. Hence subtle.

**Distinct Teaching: Three Coarse, One Subtle**

Some teach that the Middle is only revealed at the fruit stage. Faith and practice are seen as inferior, so Ten Faiths are treated as coarse. The middle at this stage is only principle, not fully containing all dharmas. Ten Grounds break ignorance and directly see the Middle, so that wisdom is subtle.

**Perfect Teaching: All Four Subtle**

Perfect wisdoms are subtle from the beginning to the end. As the dharma-mark is taught, one believes; as the principle is, one practices. From the Five Grades to Wondrous Awakening, there is no mere expedient. Wondrous Awakening is not a new wisdom added later; it is the full functioning of the wisdom already present at the Five Grades.

#### 6) Opening the Coarse to Reveal the Subtle

If the earlier sixteen wisdoms are clarified decisively, they become subtle. For example, King Wonderful Adornment had non-Buddhist world wisdom; on hearing the Lotus Sutra he awakened immediately. Wrong marks entered right marks. Without moving among views he cultivated the thirty-seven factors of awakening. Not abandoning the eight wrongs, he entered the eight rights.

When all coarse wisdoms are opened in this way, there is no coarse left to contrast. This is **Absolute Wisdom Subtlety**.

---

### Part 2: Practice Subtlety (Third Subtlety)

#### Wisdom and Practice

Practice means advancing. Without wisdom, there is no progress. Wisdom guides; practice carries. Wisdom is the eyes, practice the feet. Together they arrive at the clear cool pond of liberation.

Yet this mutual dependence is still not subtle. Subtle practice means **one practice is all practices**.

#### Scriptural Evidence

The sutras describe the bodhisattva path as complete, deep, and exhaustive. These three words mean: broad, high, and ultimate.

#### The Threefold Unity

Realm, wisdom, and practice are three but also one. Realm is expressed through dharma-marks; wisdom understands those marks; practice applies what is understood. Tiantai uses a three-dot symbol to show that these three are mutually containing, not stacked or separate. Therefore, whether one or three, there is no deficiency.

#### 1) Shared-Path Increasing-Number Practices

The Treatise explains: with one dharma as practice, one can encompass all practices. With two, or ten, or a hundred, all are still encompassed.

Practices are many, but wisdom is the root. Wisdom is the guide; practice is the caravan. Wisdom is the needle; practice is the thread. Without wisdom, practice cannot hold together.

#### 2) Teaching-Specific Increasing-Number Practices

**Tripitaka Teaching**

- **One Practice:** Non-heedfulness. Guard the mind, and the work is done.
- **Two Practices:** Cessation (samatha) and insight (vipassana).
- **Three Practices:** Discipline, concentration, and wisdom.

**Shared Teaching**

To see all dharmas as one-mark is to see them as no-mark. This is the shared contemplation of sameness and difference without contradiction.

**Distinct Teaching**

Like Sudhana visiting many teachers, each practice opens another gate. Each step breaks ignorance and enters deeper realms.

**Perfect Teaching**

The One-Practice Samadhi: in quiet sitting, the mind is bound to the Dharma-Realm. One thought is the Dharma-Realm. Ignorance becomes quiescent like space. This one practice includes all practices and is the one path out of birth and death.

#### Coarse and Subtle Judgment

- Tripitaka practices: aim only at leaving suffering; they rest in the Conjured City. Coarse.
- Shared practices: skillful, but still aim only at leaving suffering. Coarse.
- Distinct practices: rise from shallow to deep, but principle and phenomena are not fused. Coarse.
- Perfect practices: fully fused and complete. Subtle.

#### Opening the Coarse to Reveal the Subtle

Lowering the head or raising the hand, piling earth or playing with sand: all become the Buddha path when opened to the One Vehicle. When all practices are opened, no coarse remains. This is **Absolute Practice Subtlety**.

#### The Five Special Practices

There are two stages: Distinct five practices and Perfect five practices. In this fascicle, the Distinct five practices are explained through the Nirvana Sutra:

1. Sacred Practice
2. Pure Practice
3. Heavenly Practice
4. Infant Practice
5. Sick Practice

##### Sacred Practice

Sacred Practice has three parts: discipline, concentration, wisdom. It begins with faith in the Great Nirvana and in the unsurpassed path, the true dharma, and the true practice of the noble assembly. Faith in the path is faith in wisdom; faith in the true dharma is faith in concentration; faith in true practice is faith in discipline.

##### Ten Kinds of Discipline

1. Not broken: root precepts intact
2. Not deficient: no missing aspects
3. Not holed: no subtle violations
4. Not mixed: not polluted by wrong intentions
5. Following the path: precepts of the path
6. Non-attachment: precepts without grasping
7. Praised by the wise: affirmed by sages
8. Self-mastery: free and unhindered
9. Following concentration: arising from samadhi
10. Fully complete: all perfections contained

##### Pure, Heavenly, Infant, and Sick Practice (Orientation)

- **Pure Practice:** letting the mind be clean and undivided, so conduct is unstained and motives are transparent.\n- **Heavenly Practice:** an ease of mind and joy in goodness that does not depend on conditions.\n- **Infant Practice:** meeting the world without calculation or pretense, responding with simple, direct compassion.\n- **Sick Practice:** entering the field of suffering with empathy, taking on the pains of beings without turning away.

#### Opening Coarse Precepts into Subtle

Some claim that only the Brahmajala holds the bodhisattva precepts. We ask: which bodhisattva precepts? If they mean Distinct and Perfect, that can be accepted. But the deeper point is this: even Vinaya study is Great Vehicle training. The three refuges, five precepts, ten wholesome actions, and the bhikshu rules are all Mahayana when opened to the One Vehicle.

Precepts are subtle, and people are subtle. This is why the Buddha says, "You are truly my children." This is **Absolute Subtle Precepts**.

---

### Notes

- The "clear cool pond" is a common metaphor for Nirvana: liberation from the burning of affliction.
- The "three-dot" symbol is the Siddham letter I, used in Tiantai to show mutual containment: realm, wisdom, and practice arise together, not in a line. This means even the Five Grades already touch the Perfect Realm and Perfect Wisdom.

## Fascicle 4 (Part 1)

**Modern English Version (Practitioners Edition)**

---

### Position Subtlety (Fourth Subtlety)

Principle is fused, wisdom is complete, and practice has become subtle. Why add Position? Because positions show the stages that practice actually climbs.

#### Why Positions Matter

Positions appear across many sutras and treatises, but they are not all speaking the same language. Some texts map positions in a limited, single-line way. Others set out a broad ladder, but do not clearly distinguish coarse from subtle. The Lotus does not list positions by name, yet its meaning covers both expedient and real positions.

The Medicinal Herbs chapter provides the key: six positions that summarize the whole range of paths.

---

### The Six Positions in the Medicinal Herbs Parable

The parable describes small herbs, middle herbs, upper herbs, small trees, great trees, and the most real matter. These six positions map the entire progression:

| Position | Parable Image | Teaching | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Small herbs | Tripitaka | Human and heavenly paths |
| 2 | Middle herbs | Tripitaka | Two Vehicles |
| 3 | Upper herbs | Tripitaka | Tripitaka bodhisattvas |
| 4 | Small trees | Shared | Three vehicles in the shared path |
| 5 | Great trees | Distinct | Distinct bodhisattva path |
| 6 | The most real matter | Perfect | One Vehicle, fully real |

Order matters: three Tripitaka positions, then Shared, then Distinct, then Perfect. This shows the progression from expedient to real.

---

### 1) Small Herbs: Human and Heavenly Positions

Small herbs represent the human and heavenly vehicle.

#### Human Positions

The human path rests on the five precepts, with four levels of strength:

| Grade | Precept Quality | Reward |
|---|---|---|
| Lower | Basic five precepts | Iron-wheel king (one continent) |
| Middle | Moderate practice | Bronze-wheel king (two continents) |
| Upper | Strong practice | Silver-wheel king (three continents) |
| Highest | Excellent practice | Gold-wheel king (four continents) |

These are scattered-mind precepts, but combined with compassion and encouragement of others. The reward is human rulership and prosperity that naturally follows virtue.

#### Heavenly Positions

Heavenly positions come from the ten wholesome paths. Adding meditation lifts one to higher heavens. The heights of the heavens match the depth of the causes.

---

### 2) Middle Herbs: The Two Vehicles

Middle herbs represent the Two Vehicles.

#### Seven Worthy Ones

1. Five Stillings
2. Separate-aspect Mindfulness
3. General-aspect Mindfulness
4. Warmth
5. Summit
6. Patience
7. World-First Dharma

They are called worthy because they neighbor sagehood, using partial insight to subdue views and approach the true.

#### Seven Sages

1. Following-Faith Practice
2. Following-Dharma Practice
3. Faith-Understanding
4. View-Attainment
5. Body-Witness
6. Time-Liberation Arhat
7. Non-Time-Liberation Arhat

They are called sages because true wisdom sees principle and crosses into sagehood.

---

### 3) Upper Herbs: Tripitaka Bodhisattvas

Upper herbs represent the Tripitaka bodhisattva path. From the first arousing of the bodhi mind, one vows compassion, contemplates the Four Noble Truths, and practices the six paramitas.

#### The Three Incalculable Eons

- **First incalculable eon:** From Shakyamuni in past lives to Kashyapa Buddha. One still does not know for sure that Buddhahood will be reached.
- **Second incalculable eon:** From Kashyapa to Dipamkara. One knows one will become a Buddha but does not speak it.
- **Third incalculable eon:** From Dipamkara to Vipasyin. One speaks it openly without fear or hesitation.

---

### 4) Small Trees: Shared Teaching Ten Grounds

Small trees represent the Shared Teaching, where the three vehicles together use the wordless path, cut afflictions, and enter ultimate truth. The body-dharma contemplation is the same; differences lie in the strength of wisdom and the exhaustion of habits.

#### Shared Teaching Ten Grounds

| # | Ground | Content |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Dry Wisdom | Body-dharma mindfulness, no samadhi-water yet |
| 2 | Nature | Warmth through World-First Dharma |
| 3 | Eight-Person | Eight patiences complete, one wisdom short |
| 4 | Seeing | Sees ultimate non-arising Four Truths |
| 5 | Thin | Desire-realm afflictions thinned |
| 6 | Free-from-Desire | Five lower fetters exhausted |
| 7 | Done-What-Is-To-Be-Done | All three-realm afflictions cut |
| 8 | Pratyekabuddha | Encroaches on habitual tendencies |
| 9 | Bodhisattva | Exits emptiness into provisional, dual observation |
| 10 | Buddha | One thought completes all |

---

### 5) Great Trees: Distinct Teaching Positions

Great trees represent the Distinct Teaching. Names, meanings, principle, delusion, wisdom, and cutting are all distinct. This path teaches dependent-origination provisional names, Ganges-sands Buddha dharmas, Tathagatagarbha principle, eternal-abiding Nirvana, and immeasurable Four Truths, all arranged in a clear sequence. Distinct means sequential: one position follows another in fixed order. At this stage the Middle is seen as above or beyond the extremes. Only in the Perfect Teaching is the Middle seen within every extreme.

#### Distinct Teaching Fifty-Two Positions

| Stage | Positions | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Ten Faiths | 1-10 | Outer ordinary, dry wisdom, subduing patience |
| Ten Abidings | 11-20 | Inner ordinary, habit-seed nature |
| Ten Practices | 21-30 | Nature-seed nature |
| Ten Dedications | 31-40 | Way-seed nature |
| Ten Grounds | 41-50 | Sage-seed nature |
| Equal Awakening | 51 | Diamond-mind, nearly Buddha |
| Wondrous Awakening | 52 | Ultimate Buddhahood |

---

### 6) The Most Real Matter: Perfect Teaching Position

The parable says one ground gives rise to all, one rain moistens all, and the Buddha will now speak the most real matter. This final position is the Perfect Teaching: the One Vehicle, fully real.

---

### Coarse and Subtle Judgment

When the coarse is opened into the subtle, there is no coarse left to contrast. This is the meaning of Absolute Practice Subtlety.

---

### Notes

- The Six Positions from the Medicinal Herbs chapter provide the framework that unifies the range of paths under one Dharma rain, each according to its readiness.

## Fascicle 5: Three Dharmas Subtlety (Fifth Subtlety)

**Modern English Version (Practitioners Edition)**

---

### Overview

This is the dharma in which the subtle positions abide. The Three Dharmas are the Three Tracks: patterns that guide the One Vehicle. Though named as three, they are one Great Vehicle dharma.

This fascicle follows seven topics:

1. General explanation of the Three Tracks
2. Specific explanation of the Three Tracks
3. Judging coarse and subtle
4. Opening the coarse to reveal the subtle
5. Explaining beginning and end
6. Classifying the Three Dharmas
7. Four Siddhantas analysis

#### Ten Intentions Clarifying the Perfect Position

Before the Three Tracks are explained, the text frames the Perfect Position with ten intentions:

1. The name itself already carries the perfect meaning.
2. Many stages are named, but the principle remains equal.
3. How cutting and subduing uproot affliction.
4. How function benefits each capacity.
5. When provisional displays give way to the wondrous.
6. Why different position structures arise to match listeners.
7. How provisional structures fade once the real is revealed.
8. How the coarse is opened to show the subtle.
9. Why the scripture cites earlier teachings.
10. How the beginning and end of the wondrous position are one.

---

### 1) General Explanation of the Three Tracks

The Three Tracks are:

1. True Nature Track
2. Contemplative Illumination Track
3. Resource Accomplishment Track

The One Vehicle is also called Ultimate Truth, Ultimate Emptiness, and Tathagatagarbha. These are three names for one reality. They are not fixed as three, and not fixed as one. Like the three dots of the Siddham letter I, they are neither stacked nor parallel. They intercontain.

#### How the Three Tracks Link to Earlier Subtleties

- All truths discussed before are the mark of the True Nature Track.
- All wisdoms discussed before are the mark of the Contemplative Illumination Track.
- All practices discussed before are the mark of the Resource Accomplishment Track.
- All positions discussed before are the fruits of cultivating these three tracks.

---

### 2) The Perfect Teaching's Three Dharmas

#### True Nature Track

True means not false. Nature means not changing. This is the constant right cause, the teacher of all Buddhas. All beings are already of the One Vehicle. Sentient beings are precisely the mark of Nirvana. Nirvana is precisely birth-and-death. There is no need to extinguish anything outside reality.

#### Contemplative Illumination Track

Contemplative Illumination points to true nature: quiescent yet always illuminating. This is Ultimate Emptiness.

#### Resource Accomplishment Track

Resource Accomplishment points to the true-nature Dharma-Realm, which contains and stores all practices and implements. This is Tathagatagarbha.

#### Wish-Fulfilling Jewel Image

The three tracks are like a wish-fulfilling jewel with light and treasure. Light and treasure are not the jewel, yet not separate from the jewel. The tracks are likewise one, non-one, and neither-one-nor-non-one.

#### The Three Obstacles

If one is confused about the three tracks, they appear as three obstacles:

| Track Confused | Obstacle | What It Blocks |
|---|---|---|
| Resource Accomplishment | Dust-and-sand | Innumerable dharma gates |
| Contemplative Illumination | View-and-thought | Liberation |
| True Nature | Root ignorance | Realization of Buddha-nature |

When these obstacles are penetrated, the tracks are revealed:

- Penetrate dust-and-sand: Resource Accomplishment is revealed.
- Penetrate view-and-thought: Contemplative Illumination is revealed.
- Penetrate root ignorance: True Nature is revealed.

Revealed, they are named as the Three Virtues: Dharma-body, Prajna, and Liberation. The Dharma-body is the vehicle-body; Prajna and Liberation are its adornments and implements.

---

### 3) Classifying the Three Dharmas

Names vary with conditions, but the meaning is one. The text groups ten common triads under the Three Tracks.

| Category | True Nature | Contemplative Illumination | Resource Accomplishment |
|---|---|---|---|
| Three Paths | Suffering Path | Affliction Path | Karma Path |
| Three Consciousnesses | Amala | Alaya | Adana |
| Three Buddha-Natures | Right Cause | Understanding Cause | Condition Cause |
| Three Prajnas | Reality-Mark | Contemplative | Literary |
| Three Bodhis | Reality-Mark | Real Wisdom | Skillful Means |
| Three Great Vehicles | Principle Vehicle | Following Vehicle | Attainment Vehicle |
| Three Bodies | Dharma-body | Reward-body | Response-body |
| Three Nirvanas | Nature-purity | Perfect-purity | Skillful-purity |
| One-Essence Three Jewels | Dharma | Buddha | Sangha |
| Three Virtues | Dharma-body | Prajna | Liberation |

#### Example: Type-Penetrating the Three Paths

- Suffering Path is True Nature: birth-and-death is already the Dharma-body.
- Affliction Path is Contemplative Illumination: illumination depends on delusion as its field.
- Karma Path is Resource Accomplishment: good and evil are the resources that give rise to practice.

#### Example: Type-Penetrating the Three Buddha-Natures

- Right-Cause Nature aligns with True Nature Track.
- Understanding-Cause Nature aligns with Contemplative Illumination.
- Condition-Cause Nature aligns with Resource Accomplishment.

---

### 4) Judging Coarse and Subtle

The earlier enumerations can be read in two ways. Seen from the Three Tracks, what appears coarse becomes subtle. The True Nature Track is the principle side, the Contemplative Illumination Track is the interpretive side, and the Resource Accomplishment Track is the practice and result side. When these three are seen as one, the divisions among vehicles and stages collapse into a single subtle unity.

---

### 5) Opening the Coarse to Reveal the Subtle

The Perfect Teaching does not discard earlier structures. It opens them. Names, stages, vows, and practices remain in place, but they are revealed as expressions of the three tracks. The coarse becomes the doorway to the subtle.

---

### 6) Explaining Beginning and End

The beginning already contains the end. The first arousing of mind includes the ten suchnesses, which already belong to the three tracks. What appears as a sequence of seeds, stages, and powers is the unfolding of what was present from the start. The end simply manifests what the beginning already held.

---

### 7) Four Siddhantas Analysis

The Four Siddhantas are: Worldly, For-Each-Person, Therapeutic, and First Principle. They respond to different needs, but all participate in the three tracks.

- Worldly Siddhanta: introduces broad patterns for beginners.
- For-Each-Person Siddhanta: adapts to individual capacities.
- Therapeutic Siddhanta: prescribes remedies to cut affliction.
- First Principle Siddhanta: points directly to Ultimate Truth.

The first three are provisional and breakable; the First Principle is unbreakable and subtle. The Perfect Teaching keeps all four, while revealing their unity in the Three Tracks.

---

### Notes

- The Three Tracks correspond to reality realized (True Nature), wisdom realizing (Contemplative Illumination), and practice enabling realization (Resource Accomplishment). They are one reality spoken from three angles.

<a id="fascicle-6"></a>
## Fascicle 6: Resonance Subtlety (Sixth Subtlety)

**Modern English Version (Practitioners Edition)**

---

### Overview

The earlier subtleties are the Perfect Causes. The Three Dharmas are the Perfect Fruit. Fruit-wisdom is quiet yet illuminating. When a stimulus appears, it must respond. That is why Resonance Subtlety follows.

This fascicle treats six topics:

1. Names of readiness and response
2. Marks of readiness and response
3. Sameness and difference
4. Correspondence
5. Coarse and subtle
6. Mind contemplation

---

### 1) Names of Readiness and Response

#### Readiness (Stimulus)

Readiness has three meanings:

1. **Readiness as subtle:** a quiet stirring that precedes change.
2. **Readiness as hinge or gate:** beings pivot on the sage’s compassion.
3. **Readiness as suitability:** what needs uprooting suits compassion; what needs joy suits kindness.

#### Response

Response has three meanings:

1. **Going-to:** when readiness stirs, the sage goes and good arises.
2. **Matching:** buyer and seller correspond; readiness and response meet.
3. **Responding:** compassion answers what is suitable.

---

### 2) Marks of Readiness and Response

#### Good and Evil as Readiness

Readiness includes both good and evil. From the lowest beings up to Equal Awakening, good and evil interlink. That interlinking is itself readiness.

#### Three Times of Readiness

Readiness exists across past, present, and future. Generally all three are readiness. Specifically, **future good and evil** are primary, because the work of response is to uproot future evil and produce future good.

---

### 3) The Four Sentences of Resonance

| Type | Readiness | Response | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| Hidden / Hidden | Past good | Hidden benefit | No visible sign, yet real help |
| Hidden / Manifest | Past good | Visible meeting | Past causes ripen into present benefit |
| Manifest / Manifest | Present effort | Visible response | Practice evokes clear signs |
| Manifest / Hidden | Present effort | Hidden benefit | No visible sign, yet benefit accrues |

**Practical effect:** every bow and raised hand is not wasted. If there is no visible response, do not fall into wrong views. Hidden benefit still works.

#### The Thirty-Six Sentences

Readiness can be hidden, manifest, both, or neither. Hidden points to the past, manifest to the present, both to past-and-present, and neither to the future. Each of these has four response patterns, and responses mirror this structure. These combinations yield thirty-six resonance sentences. The point: response can be working even when it is unseen.

---

### 4) Coarse and Subtle

- **Nine-realm readiness is coarse; Buddha-realm readiness is subtle.**
- Tripitaka and Common Teaching responses are intentional and effortful, like a painting made by hand.
- Distinct and Perfect responses are unforced and natural, like a clear mirror reflecting whatever appears.

**Mirror image:** the moon does not descend and the waters do not rise, yet the reflection appears everywhere at once. This is inconceivable, subtle response.

---

### 5) Opening the Coarse to Reveal the Subtle

The Lotus returns the immeasurable to the one. Three grasses and two trees grow from one ground and are moistened by one rain. The wise understand: what appears as different is one source. Thus **nine-realm readiness is Buddha-realm readiness**, and the responses of all sages are subtle responses. Coarse is opened into subtle.

---

### 6) Mind Contemplation

Zhiyi turns to the mind itself. Readiness and response are not only external events; they are the mind’s own habits. Observe how **love** (attachment) and **view** (conceptual grasping) arise and pass. When these are seen clearly, the same energies that once fed defilement become the field of wisdom. This is the integration point where stimulus and response become one observing mind.

---


### Overview

After resonance, the text turns to transformative function that benefits others. These are the **Three Wheels** of transformation: body, speech, and mind.

#### The Three Wheels

- **Body wheel:** roaming in the world to appear where needed.
- **Speech wheel:** expounding the Dharma.
- **Mind wheel:** the wisdom that makes the other two possible.

#### The Six Powers

1. Heavenly eye
2. Heavenly ear
3. Knowing others’ minds
4. Knowing past lives
5. Transforming the body
6. Outflow-free powers

Supernatural means natural mind; powers means wisdom-nature. When obstructions are cleared, wisdom-nature acts without blockage.

#### Real Transformation vs Illusion

Illusions only deceive the eye. True powers actually transform dharmas. Like water freezing or metal melting, the change is real when wisdom-nature is present.

#### Powers Across Teachings

| Teaching | Power Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Ghosts and spirits | Karmic retribution | Born with powers |
| Humans | Medicine-induced | Through herbs or methods |
| Externalists | Root meditation | From basic dhyana |
| Tripitaka | Abandonment-based | From eight liberations |
| Common Teaching | Body-dharma based | Instant emptiness insight |
| Distinct Teaching | Sequential | Pre-ground and ground-entry |
| Perfect Teaching | Non-intentional | Natural Middle-way powers |

#### Perfect Teaching Powers

Perfect powers arise from the Middle. All six sense roots are wisdom in mutual function. These powers do not depend on mundane meditation. They arise naturally from the Reality-Mark and are undiminished.

#### Coarse and Subtle Powers

- **Coarse powers** are effortful, like a painting made by hand.
- **Subtle powers** are natural, like a clear mirror reflecting forms.

#### Powers in the Five Flavors

| Flavor | Powers |
|---|---|
| Milk | One coarse, one subtle |
| Curds | One coarse only |
| Fresh Butter | Three coarse, one subtle |
| Clarified Butter | Two coarse, one subtle |
| Ghee (Lotus) | One subtle only |

The Lotus uses powers only for the subtle.

#### Ten Auspicious Signs

The opening chapter’s ten signs each reflect a subtlety:

1. Ground purified: Realm
2. Light from brow: Wisdom
3. Entering samadhi: Practice
4. Flowers from heaven: Position
5. Fragrant wind: Vehicle
6. Doubt and vision of many lands: Resonance
7. Sixfold quake: Supernatural powers
8. Heavenly drum and Dharma: Teaching
9. Beings rejoicing: Retinue
10. Buddha-children practicing: Benefits

#### Opening Coarse to Reveal Subtle

The Lotus does not merely add subtle to coarse; it removes coarse by clarifying it. All powers become one subtle Buddha-matter.

---


Zhiyi proceeds in order:

1. Twelve canonical designations (sutra, verse, parable, analysis, and so on).
2. Four naming patterns and the structure of the compendia.
3. Five flavors as the coarse ordering of earlier teachings.
4. Lotus as opening and combining that reveals the one Middle.

All names point to the Reality-Mark rather than separate truths.

---


The retinue is read as readiness-response in stages:

1. Hearing and trust form the outer retinue.
2. Practice and discipline form the inner retinue.
3. Love-mind and view-mind are examined as roots of clinging.
4. Karmic affinity and vow convert hostility into kinship.

The true retinue is internal: heirs formed by the Perfect Teaching.

---


Benefits are ordered in four layers:

1. Buddha’s intent: why benefits arise.
2. Correct proclamation: how benefits are triggered.
3. Propagation: how benefits spread.
4. Mind contemplation: how benefits are internalized.

Zhiyi then traces ten levels of benefit: relief at the fruit level, transformation at the cause level, samadhi powers for hearers, middle-way purification, gradual conversions through the vehicles, and finally the consummate land beyond birth and death. Each level cuts a deeper defilement so the Dharma can meet every capacity, from coarse duty to final realization.

#### The Three Cycles of Benefit

Benefit is not a one-time reward. It is a cycle that spans lifetimes, with three phases:

1. **Root Benefit (Sowing the seed):** The Buddha plants the One Vehicle seed through an encounter, a word, or a gesture. Even if it is ignored or rejected, the seed is not lost.
2. **Ripening Benefit (Maturing the growth):** The earlier teachings moisten the seed. Provisional teachings weed afflictions and grow capacity through time.
3. **Release Benefit (Harvesting the fruit):** The Lotus opens and combines all prior efforts, revealing that even coarse struggles were part of subtle ripening.

This prevents a narrow idea of benefit as only immediate peace. A difficult life can be the ripening phase. Whether one believes or slanders, the seed is planted. Whether one progresses or regresses, the Buddha’s response does not cease.

---

### Notes

- The Four Sentences of resonance explain why sincere practice may show no visible results while still bearing real benefit.

## Fascicle 7: Fundamental and Trace

**Modern English Version (Practitioners Edition)**

---

### Introduction: The Two Halves

The Ten Trace Subtleties are the first half of the jewel: the Buddha’s historical manifestation. Now we enter the Ten Fundamental Subtleties: the Buddha’s eternal nature revealed in the Lifespan chapter. This is the “temporal collapse” where the Buddha’s enlightenment is shown as beginningless, and the historical narrative is a skillful projection for teaching.

---

### Part One: Six Meanings of Fundamental and Trace

1. **Principle as Fundamental:** The Reality-Mark is Fundamental. Everything else is Trace.
2. **Principle-and-Event as Fundamental:** Both principle and event are Fundamental; teaching about them is Trace.
3. **Teaching as Fundamental:** The teaching itself is Fundamental; practice based on it is Trace, like footprints that lead back to the place.
4. **Body as Fundamental:** The realized body is Fundamental; its functions are Trace.
5. **Real Attainment as Fundamental:** Actual attainment is Fundamental; provisional bestowal is Trace.
6. **Revealed-Now as Fundamental:** What is revealed now is Fundamental; what was said before is Trace.

| # | Fundamental | Trace |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Reality-Mark principle | Everything else |
| 2 | Principle and event | Teaching about them |
| 3 | Teaching | Practice based on teaching |
| 4 | Body/Substance | Function/Use |
| 5 | Real attainment | Provisional bestowal |
| 6 | What is revealed now | What was said before |

---

### Part Two: The Ten Fundamental Subtleties

Order matters: cause, fruit, land, resonance, powers, exposition, retinue, Nirvana, lifespan, benefits.

#### 1) Fundamental Cause Subtlety

The original arousing of the bodhi mind and the first perfect cause. Later events in history are trace causes, not the original. The Lotus removes these traces to clear doubt and return to the beginningless cause.

#### 2) Fundamental Fruit Subtlety

The original fruit is the Buddha’s attainment from immeasurable time. It is not limited to a specific place or a recent awakening. This is the fundamental fruit.

#### 3) Fundamental Land Subtlety

Having the fundamental fruit implies a fundamental land. The Buddha has always taught in this world, but not as a mere historical scene. This is the fundamental land: the place where the eternal Buddha teaches.

#### 4) Fundamental Resonance Subtlety

From that original attainment, the Buddha’s compassion, vows, and samadhi function without interruption. Readiness and response interconnect without effort. This is fundamental resonance.

#### 5) Fundamental Supernatural Powers

Original powers arise naturally from the Middle, not from effort. Transformation is effortless and constant.

#### 6) Fundamental Dharma-Exposition

The original turning of the Dharma-wheel is not a single historical sermon. It is the ongoing exposition of the eternal Buddha.

#### 7) Fundamental Retinue

The original disciples are not just those present in history. The Buddha says those who appear later are already his children. The retinue is timeless.

#### 8) Fundamental Nirvana

Nirvana is not a final disappearance. It is the original reality where extinction and non-extinction interpenetrate.

#### 9) Fundamental Lifespan

The lifespan is limitless. The Buddha’s life is not measured by time but by the timeless Reality-Mark.

#### 10) Fundamental Benefits

Benefits flow from the original Buddha through karma, vows, powers, and responses. They are not bound to one time or place.

---

### Near Benefits and the Tenfold Sequence

The text describes near benefits that arise when the Dharma is proclaimed from the Nirvana-stage. It then lays out a tenfold sequence of benefits, ranging from relief of suffering to the full realization of the real land. The point is that the Lotus gathers all benefits into one whole: coarse and subtle merge, and the Buddha’s response reaches every capacity.

---

### Benefit Questions and the Three Truths

The ten benefits are necessary because each level cuts a deeper layer of ignorance. The three truths are already present in every realm, so the Lotus does not create a new reality. It reveals the reality already woven into every moment of practice.

---

### Fundamental and Trace Are Inconceivably One

Fundamental and Trace are different, yet not two. The Trace arises from the Fundamental. By following the Trace, we arrive at the Fundamental. Ultimately, they are non-dual.

---

### Notes

- The Ten Fundamental Subtleties parallel the Ten Trace Subtleties but reveal the eternal Buddha rather than the historical display.

<a id="fascicle-8"></a>
## Fascicle 8: The Generic Title (Sutra) and Substance

**Modern English Version (Practitioners Edition)**

---

### Part One: The Generic Title -- Sutra

The word Sutra carries multiple layers of meaning. The text presents five sections:

1. Why it cannot be translated
2. Why it can be translated
3. Harmonizing both views
4. Explaining Sutra through dharmas
5. Explaining Sutra through mind contemplation

---

### 1) Five Meanings That Cannot Be Translated

The claim here is that one language cannot compress all meanings into a single equivalent. Sutra carries five layered meanings:

1. **Dharma source:** one word spoken by the Buddha flows into countless teachings.
2. **Subtle development:** understanding grows from rough to refined in stages.
3. **Gushing spring:** teaching and meaning are inexhaustible.
4. **Plumb-line:** it cuts off deviant views and straightens the crooked.
5. **Flower garland:** it threads teaching, practice, and principle so they do not scatter.

---

### 2) Five Meanings That Can Be Translated

Another tradition says it can be translated through five angles:

1. **Passage:** everything passes through the sage’s mind.
2. **Accord:** it fits conditions, events, and principle.
3. **Dharma source:** as above.
4. **Thread:** it sews together teaching, practice, and principle.
5. **Good teaching:** it guides words, actions, and insight toward the good.

---

### 3) Harmonizing Both Views

Zhiyi does not choose one side. He says the word Sutra holds all meanings at once. The traditional five are expanded into fifteen by applying teaching, practice, and principle to each of the five. The point is not the label but the depth it carries.

---

### Part Two: Substance -- Reality-Mark

Substance is the return point of the whole text: the Reality-Mark. The section follows seven topics:

1. Directly revealing the sutra’s substance
2. Distinguishing false from true
3. One dharma, different names
4. Gates of entry to substance
5. Pervading all sutras
6. Pervading all practices
7. Pervading all dharmas

---

### 1) Directly Revealing the Substance

The correct substance is the **Reality-Mark**. It is the One Reality that seals all dharmas. This is shown in the Lotus by:

- The Buddha emitting light to reveal the Reality-Mark.
- Only Buddha with Buddha fully knowing the Reality-Mark of all dharmas.
- Opening the expedient gate and revealing the true Reality-Mark.

---

### 2) Distinguishing False from True

Zhiyi rejects several proposed substances as too general or too narrow, then establishes the Reality-Mark as the true substance.

He illustrates this with three similes:

1. **Three beasts crossing a river:** the elephant reaches the bottom, showing fullness of realization.
2. **Crystal and wish-fulfilling jewel:** crystal is empty but yields no treasure; the jewel is empty and fruitful.
3. **Gold in stone:** the true substance is like gold hidden in stone, refined into its pure state.

---

### 3) One Dharma, Different Names

The Reality-Mark is one but has many names: suchness, Nirvana, Dharma-nature, Tathagata Treasury, Middle, ultimate truth, subtle quiescence, and more. The names shift by angle and capacity. The substance does not change.

Disputes arise when people cling to one name and reject the rest. The point is to see through the names to the single reality.

---

### 4) Gates of Entry to the Reality-Mark

Reality-Mark is entered through gates, not clung to as positions. The four gates are:

1. Existence
2. Emptiness
3. Both
4. Neither

Each is a doorway into the nondual Reality-Mark. A gate is for entering, not for staying. These four gates appear across the four teachings. A gate of existence in the Tripitaka differs in depth from a gate of existence in the Perfect Teaching, yet each is a valid entry for its context.

---

### 5) Pervading All Sutras, Practices, and Dharmas

Because Reality-Mark is the Dharma-Realm itself, it pervades all sutras, all practices, and all dharmas. It is not a separate object but the common ground that makes every teaching coherent and every practice effective.

---

### 6) Explaining Sutra Through Dharmas

Sutra can be expressed through sound, written form, and mental objects. In other worlds, different senses may be primary, but every sense object is part of the Dharma-Realm. Thus any sense object can function as Sutra.

A single stroke can carry a word, a word can carry a doctrine, and a doctrine can carry the whole teaching. Form is not just a container; it can disclose the teaching when read correctly.

---

### 7) Observing the Mind as Sutra

Mind contains all dharmas. It fulfills the five untranslatable meanings and the five translatable meanings. When the mind is observed, it becomes the Sutra itself. This closes the title section: the title is not just a word on a page but the living dynamic of mind and Dharma.

---

### Notes

- The fifteen meanings of Sutra show how a single title carries inexhaustible depth when read through teaching, practice, and principle.


---


<a id="fascicle-9"></a>
## Fascicle 9: Entering Real Contemplation, Coarse/Subtle, Essence, and Function

**Modern English Version (Practitioners Edition)**

---

### Part One: Entering Real Contemplation Through the Round Gate

Zhiyi now turns from naming and substance to entering real contemplation through the Round Gate. First he distinguishes the gates, then he explains the round contemplation.

#### Distinguishing the Four Gates

- **Tripitaka gate:** extinguishes form to reach the true, but invites contention.
- **Shared gate:** treats illusory form as true, pointing to non-contention.
- **Distinct gate:** moves sequentially, passing through the Middle in stages.
- **Round gate:** birth-and-death is Dharma-nature, Dharma-nature is the Middle. This is non-contentious.

#### Ten Differences Between Distinct and Round

1. Integrated vs not integrated
2. Identical to dharmas vs not identical
3. Buddha wisdom vs non-Buddha wisdom
4. Non-sequential practice vs sequential practice
5. Not-cutting cutting vs progressive cutting
6. Provisional stages vs fixed stages
7. Non-vertical fruit vs vertical fruit
8. Round exposition vs partial exposition
9. Question and answer already reveal One Vehicle
10. Parables that include all gates at once

#### Ten Marks of the Round Gate in the Lotus

1. Contemplate all dharmas as empty, as the Reality-Mark.
2. Worldly livelihoods do not contradict the Reality-Mark.
3. Open, show, awaken, enter Buddha knowledge and vision.
4. Wear the Tathagata’s robe, sit on his seat, dwell in his room.
5. Pass beyond five hundred yojanas.
6. Five grades and purity of six roots.
7. Ride the jeweled carriage and roam the four directions.
8. The Buddha abides in the Great Vehicle, adorned with meditation and wisdom.
9. With palms together, wish to hear the complete path.
10. The Reality-Mark teaching has already been spoken.

#### The Four Marks of the Round Gate

1. Existence
2. Emptiness
3. Both existence and emptiness
4. Neither existence nor emptiness

These four gates are revealed as the Round Four Gates.

#### Ten Contemplations for Entering the Real

1. Know the object of contemplation: birth-and-death is the inconceivable truth.
2. Arouse true resolve: great compassion and great vows.
3. Settle the mind: concentration and wisdom together.
4. Break through dharmas: cut obstructions like a diamond axe.
5. Know blockage and openness.
6. Know the factors of the path.
7. Apply antidotes: use truth as medicine.
8. Know the stages: from principle-Nirvana to ultimate realization.
9. Patient endurance: steady the mind against disturbance.
10. No attachment to dharmas: liberation, wisdom, and Dharma-body appear together.

---

### Part Two: Judging Gates as Coarse or Subtle

#### Coarse and Subtle by Leading and Led

- Tripitaka gates: coarse leading and coarse led.
- Shared gates: subtle leading, coarse led.
- Distinct gates: coarse leading, subtle led.
- Perfect gates: subtle leading and subtle led.

#### Coarse and Subtle by the Gates Themselves

A gate is subtle when it completes the Four Siddhantas and the ten contemplations; coarse when it misses them.

---

### Part Three: Opening Coarse to Reveal Subtle

When the teaching has matured its audience, the Lotus opens coarse gates to reveal the subtle gate as complete meaning.

---

### Part Four: The Reality-Mark as the Body of All Sutras

The Reality-Mark is the body of all sutras. This section has five topics: names, lateral and primary distinctions, comparisons, and coarse/subtle opening.

This sutra’s body is called Reality-Mark, Buddha knowledge and vision, great cause-and-condition, Dharma-seal, great vehicle, treasure ground, secret treasury, equal great wisdom, universal gate, and more. The names differ; the body is one.

Other sutras name the same body as ultimate emptiness, Tathagata treasury, Middle, and so on. The Lotus opens provisional names into the Reality-Mark.

---

### Part Five: The Body of Practices

Practice appears across the four teachings in two forms: faith-practice and principle-practice. Horizontal practices and staged practices both take the Reality-Mark as body. The Four Modes of Samadhi are grounded in the Reality-Mark.

Small practices are opened and revealed as subtle because the Lotus brings all practice into the one Reality-Mark.

---

### Part Six: The Body of All Dharmas

All dharmas take the Reality-Mark as body. The Four Truths encompass the full range of worldly and supramundane causes and effects. The body itself is wondrous and without difference, while dependent dharmas can be coarse or subtle by function.

---

### Part Seven: Essence (Third of the Five Chapters)

Essence is the throat of practice and the main cord of the net. It is not identical with substance. Essence means cause and fruit together.

#### The Correct Essence

The Lotus establishes the disciples’ real cause in the Trace Gate and reveals the teacher’s real fruit in the Fundamental Gate. Cause is primary in the first half; fruit is primary in the second half. Together they form the sutra’s essence.

---

### Part Eight: Function (Fourth of the Five Chapters)

Function is the sutra’s power. This sutra’s unique power is breaking doubt and generating faith.

#### Ten Uses of the Trace Gate

1. Breaking three, revealing one
2. Abandoning three, revealing one
3. Opening three, revealing one
4. Meeting three, revealing one
5. Abiding in one, revealing one
6. Abiding in three, revealing one
7. Abiding in neither-three-nor-one, revealing one
8. Covering three, revealing one
9. Abiding in three, using one
10. Abiding in one, using three

#### Ten Uses of the Fundamental Gate

1. Breaking trace, revealing fundamental
2. Abandoning trace, revealing fundamental
3. Opening trace, revealing fundamental
4. Meeting trace, revealing fundamental
5. Abiding in fundamental, revealing fundamental
6. Abiding in trace, revealing fundamental
7. Abiding in neither-trace-nor-fundamental, revealing fundamental
8. Covering trace, revealing fundamental
9. Abiding in trace, using fundamental
10. Abiding in fundamental, using trace

#### Connection to the Four Siddhantas

The ten uses map to the four Siddhantas. Each audience hears according to its kind, yet all are led to the One Vehicle.

---

### Notes

- The Lotus Sutra’s essence is One-Vehicle cause-and-fruit: Trace Gate (cause-primary) and Fundamental Gate (fruit-primary) together.

<a id="fascicle-10"></a>
## Fascicle 10: Teaching Classification -- Five Periods and Eight Teachings

**Modern English Version (Practitioners Edition)**

---

### The Fifth Chapter: Teaching Classification

If one teaches other sutras, classification is helpful but not required. If one teaches the Lotus, classification is essential; without it, the text’s meaning remains incomplete.

Zhiyi lays out five parts:

1. Overall meaning
2. Differing interpretations
3. Difficulties and refutations
4. What to accept and reject
5. Final classification

### Three Great Structures

#### 1) Three Kinds of Teaching

- **Sudden:** direct teaching without stages
- **Gradual:** step-by-step teaching
- **Indeterminate:** neither fixed sudden nor gradual

#### 2) Five Periods (Five Flavors)

| Period | Teaching | Flavor |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Avatamsaka (for high bodhisattvas) | Milk |
| 2 | Agamas (Tripitaka for Two Vehicles) | Curds |
| 3 | Vaipulya (scolding small, praising great) | Fresh Butter |
| 4 | Prajnaparamita (emptiness for all) | Clarified Butter |
| 5 | Lotus and Nirvana (ultimate) | Ghee |

#### 3) Four Teachings

| Teaching | Characteristic |
|---|---|
| Tripitaka | Analytical emptiness |
| Shared | Embodied emptiness |
| Distinct | Sequential Middle |
| Perfect | Immediate Middle |

### Critique of Other Systems

Zhiyi surveys ten competing classification schemes and refutes them in order. Each fails either by ignoring explicit texts or by collapsing expedients.

---

### Difficulties and Refutations (in Sequence)

1. **South five-period scheme:** misreads early teachings and misplaces Lotus and Nirvana.
2. **South four-period scheme:** collapses distinct phases into one.
3. **South three-period scheme:** erases the Lotus role of opening three and returning to one.
4. **North five-period scheme:** misclassifies early texts and their results.
5. **Half/Full scheme:** cannot explain why Lotus is unique.
6. **Four Tenets:** weak scriptural support and blurred categories.
7. **Five Tenets:** adds a highest category that earlier texts already teach.
8. **Six Tenets:** splits true and round into contradiction.
9. **Two Great Vehicles:** cannot separate marks and no-marks without contradiction.
10. **One Sound teaching:** erases skillful means and variety of capacities.

---

### What to Accept and Reject

**Accept:**

- Five Flavors as expedient order, when paired with Half/Full.
- Half/Full as real intent, when paired with Five Flavors.
- Four Teachings as doctrinal map aligned with Five Flavors.

**Reject:**

- Any system that replaces the Lotus as final.
- Any system that erases expedients.
- Any system that privileges one gate while ignoring the other three.

### The Correct Teaching Classification

#### The Three Proofs

1. **Skillful Means + Intro:** sudden first, then gradual.
2. **Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings:** sequence of Four Truths to Prajna.
3. **Trust-and-Understanding:** parable mirrors Five Flavors.

#### Five Flavors and Half/Full Combined

| Period | Flavor | Half/Full |
|---|---|---|
| Huayan | Milk | Full only |
| Agamas | Curds | Half only |
| Vaipulya | Fresh Butter | Half and Full opposed |
| Prajna | Clarified Butter | Carrying half, discussing full |
| Lotus | Ghee | Abandoning half, clarifying full |

**Logic:**

- Full appears from the start, but beings need expedient half-teachings to mature.
- Each period refines capacity toward the Lotus.

---

### Opening and Combining

One Vehicle is opened into many, then returned to one. Zhiyi applies this by number:

- **Two:** Half and Full
- **Three:** One opened into three, returned to one
- **Four:** Four teachings or four gates
- **Five:** Five flavors
- **Six to Eight:** six perfections, seven factors, eightfold path

#### Combining or Not Combining

- **Huayan:** not combined (full only)
- **Agamas:** not combined (half only)
- **Vaipulya:** not combined (half hears full but does not enter)
- **Prajna:** combined in dharma, not in person
- **Lotus:** fully combined (people and dharma)
- **Nirvana:** both combined and not combined (keeps expedients)

#### Broad vs Specific

- **Specific:** each flavor has a fixed place.
- **Broad:** each flavor can extend earlier and later.

### The Master’s Conclusion

Zhiyi closes by saying this is only a rough statement of what he holds. Words cannot fully express meaning. If one penetrates the Ten Subtleties and follows the interlocking logic of the chapters, the path of perfect penetration opens here.

---

### Notes

- The Five Periods are the temporal ordering of the Buddha’s teaching career.
- The Four Teachings are the doctrinal map used to read the Five Periods.
- The complete system is Five Periods plus Half/Full plus Four Teachings.
