## Part 1: Wisdom Subtlety (Second Subtlety)

The ultimate principle is deep and subtle. Without wisdom, it cannot be revealed. Wisdom knows what is to be known; without a realm to know, there is no fusion. Because the realm is subtle, wisdom must match it, like a shadow follows a form. That is why Wisdom follows Realm in the sequence.

### Overview of the Six Topics

Wisdom is discussed in two ways: (1) Wisdom in general, (2) Wisdom in relation to realm. The general discussion has six topics:

1. Number
2. Classification
3. Characteristics
4. Illumination
5. Judgment
6. Opening (coarse to subtle)

### 1) The Number: Twenty Wisdoms

These twenty wisdoms move from common to complete:

| # | Wisdom | Teaching |
|---|--------|----------|
| 1 | World Wisdom | Mundane |
| 2 | Five Stillings and Four Mindfulnesses | Tripitaka |
| 3 | Four Roots of Good | Tripitaka |
| 4 | Four Fruits | Tripitaka |
| 5 | Pratyekabuddha Wisdom | Tripitaka |
| 6 | Six Perfections | Tripitaka |
| 7 | Tripitaka Shravaka Body-Dharma | Shared |
| 8 | Shared Pratyekabuddha | Shared |
| 9 | Shared Bodhisattva Entry-True Expedient | Shared |
| 10 | Shared Bodhisattva Exit-Provisional | Shared |
| 11 | Distinct Ten Faiths | Distinct |
| 12 | Distinct Thirty Minds | Distinct |
| 13 | Distinct Ten Grounds | Distinct |
| 14 | Tripitaka Buddha Wisdom | Tripitaka |
| 15 | Shared Teaching Buddha Wisdom | Shared |
| 16 | Distinct Teaching Buddha Wisdom | Distinct |
| 17 | Perfect Five Grades of Disciples | Perfect |
| 18 | Six Roots Purified | Perfect |
| 19 | First Abiding to Equal Awakening | Perfect |
| 20 | Wondrous Awakening | Perfect |

### 2) Classification by Group

- World Wisdom: outside the path, dominated by wrong views and attachment.
- Five Stillings and Four Mindfulnesses: both are outer-ordinary.
- Four Roots of Good: inner-ordinary.
- Four Fruits: all see truth.
- Pratyekabuddha: separate-aspect contemplation.
- Six Perfections: weak in principle, strong in phenomena.
- Shared Shravaka and Shared Pratyekabuddha: higher than Tripitaka.
- Shared Bodhisattva Entry-True and Exit-Provisional: learn all four gates and properly condition the conventional.
- Distinct Ten Faiths: first contact with the Middle, higher than before, lower than later.
- Distinct Thirty Minds: inner-ordinary.
- Distinct Ten Grounds: sage-wisdom.
- Tripitaka, Shared, and Distinct Buddha Wisdoms: each surpasses the former.
- Perfect stages: from Five Grades to Wondrous Awakening, all are fully complete.

Thus, by grouping similar types and separating dissimilar ones, we count twenty.

### 3) Distinguishing Characteristics

**World Wisdom**

Worldly wisdom can reach refined concentration and even supernatural abilities, but it is still driven by fame, profit, views, and craving. That is why it is called world wisdom.

**Four Roots of Good**

- **Warmth:** Wisdom begins to burn away affliction, like a fire drill that finally catches.
- **Summit:** Like reaching a mountain peak, one does not stay long; a small obstacle can cause retreat.
- **Patience:** Gradual endurance of the truths of suffering across the realms, deepening step by step.
- **World-First Dharma:** The most superior mind, like the top of a banner with nothing higher.

### 4) Illumination: Four Wisdoms Illuminate Four Types of Twelve Links

1. Seven wisdoms (World Wisdom through Tripitaka Buddha) illuminate **conceivable arising-and-ceasing**.
2. Five shared wisdoms illuminate **conceivable non-arising and non-ceasing**.
3. Four distinct wisdoms illuminate **inconceivable arising-and-ceasing**.
4. Four perfect wisdoms illuminate **inconceivable non-arising and non-ceasing**.

### 5) Judging Coarse and Subtle

- The first twelve wisdoms are coarse; the latter eight are subtle.
- Tripitaka and Shared Buddhas are impermanent and do not teach permanence, so their disciples cannot fully cultivate permanence. Hence coarse.
- Distinct Ten Faiths hear permanence from the start, so they surpass the Tripitaka and Shared wisdoms. Hence subtle.

**Distinct Teaching: Three Coarse, One Subtle**

Some teach that the Middle is only revealed at the fruit stage. Faith and practice are seen as inferior, so Ten Faiths are treated as coarse. The middle at this stage is only principle, not fully containing all dharmas. Ten Grounds break ignorance and directly see the Middle, so that wisdom is subtle.

**Perfect Teaching: All Four Subtle**

Perfect wisdoms are subtle from the beginning to the end. As the dharma-mark is taught, one believes; as the principle is, one practices. From the Five Grades to Wondrous Awakening, there is no mere expedient. Wondrous Awakening is not a new wisdom added later; it is the full functioning of the wisdom already present at the Five Grades.

### 6) Opening the Coarse to Reveal the Subtle

If the earlier sixteen wisdoms are clarified decisively, they become subtle. For example, King Wonderful Adornment had non-Buddhist world wisdom; on hearing the Lotus Sutra he awakened immediately. Wrong marks entered right marks. Without moving among views he cultivated the thirty-seven factors of awakening. Not abandoning the eight wrongs, he entered the eight rights.

When all coarse wisdoms are opened in this way, there is no coarse left to contrast. This is **Absolute Wisdom Subtlety**.

## Part 2: Practice Subtlety (Third Subtlety)

### Wisdom and Practice

Practice means advancing. Without wisdom, there is no progress. Wisdom guides; practice carries. Wisdom is the eyes, practice the feet. Together they arrive at the clear cool pond of liberation.

Yet this mutual dependence is still not subtle. Subtle practice means **one practice is all practices**.

### Scriptural Evidence

The sutras describe the bodhisattva path as complete, deep, and exhaustive. These three words mean: broad, high, and ultimate.

### The Threefold Unity

Realm, wisdom, and practice are three but also one. Realm is expressed through dharma-marks; wisdom understands those marks; practice applies what is understood. Tiantai uses a three-dot symbol to show that these three are mutually containing, not stacked or separate. Therefore, whether one or three, there is no deficiency.

### 1) Shared-Path Increasing-Number Practices

The Treatise explains: with one dharma as practice, one can encompass all practices. With two, or ten, or a hundred, all are still encompassed.

Practices are many, but wisdom is the root. Wisdom is the guide; practice is the caravan. Wisdom is the needle; practice is the thread. Without wisdom, practice cannot hold together.

### 2) Teaching-Specific Increasing-Number Practices

**Tripitaka Teaching**

- **One Practice:** Non-heedfulness. Guard the mind, and the work is done.
- **Two Practices:** Cessation (samatha) and insight (vipassana).
- **Three Practices:** Discipline, concentration, and wisdom.

**Shared Teaching**

To see all dharmas as one-mark is to see them as no-mark. This is the shared contemplation of sameness and difference without contradiction.

**Distinct Teaching**

Like Sudhana visiting many teachers, each practice opens another gate. Each step breaks ignorance and enters deeper realms.

**Perfect Teaching**

The One-Practice Samadhi: in quiet sitting, the mind is bound to the Dharma-Realm. One thought is the Dharma-Realm. Ignorance becomes quiescent like space. This one practice includes all practices and is the one path out of birth and death.

### Coarse and Subtle Judgment

- Tripitaka practices: aim only at leaving suffering; they rest in the Conjured City. Coarse.
- Shared practices: skillful, but still aim only at leaving suffering. Coarse.
- Distinct practices: rise from shallow to deep, but principle and phenomena are not fused. Coarse.
- Perfect practices: fully fused and complete. Subtle.

### Opening the Coarse to Reveal the Subtle

Lowering the head or raising the hand, piling earth or playing with sand: all become the Buddha path when opened to the One Vehicle. When all practices are opened, no coarse remains. This is **Absolute Practice Subtlety**.

### The Five Special Practices

There are two stages: Distinct five practices and Perfect five practices. In this fascicle, the Distinct five practices are explained through the Nirvana Sutra:

1. Sacred Practice
2. Pure Practice
3. Heavenly Practice
4. Infant Practice
5. Sick Practice

#### Sacred Practice

Sacred Practice has three parts: discipline, concentration, wisdom. It begins with faith in the Great Nirvana and in the unsurpassed path, the true dharma, and the true practice of the noble assembly. Faith in the path is faith in wisdom; faith in the true dharma is faith in concentration; faith in true practice is faith in discipline.

#### Ten Kinds of Discipline

1. Not broken: root precepts intact
2. Not deficient: no missing aspects
3. Not holed: no subtle violations
4. Not mixed: not polluted by wrong intentions
5. Following the path: precepts of the path
6. Non-attachment: precepts without grasping
7. Praised by the wise: affirmed by sages
8. Self-mastery: free and unhindered
9. Following concentration: arising from samadhi
10. Fully complete: all perfections contained

#### Pure, Heavenly, Infant, and Sick Practice (Orientation)

- **Pure Practice:** letting the mind be clean and undivided, so conduct is unstained and motives are transparent.\n- **Heavenly Practice:** an ease of mind and joy in goodness that does not depend on conditions.\n- **Infant Practice:** meeting the world without calculation or pretense, responding with simple, direct compassion.\n- **Sick Practice:** entering the field of suffering with empathy, taking on the pains of beings without turning away.

### Opening Coarse Precepts into Subtle

Some claim that only the Brahmajala holds the bodhisattva precepts. We ask: which bodhisattva precepts? If they mean Distinct and Perfect, that can be accepted. But the deeper point is this: even Vinaya study is Great Vehicle training. The three refuges, five precepts, ten wholesome actions, and the bhikshu rules are all Mahayana when opened to the One Vehicle.

Precepts are subtle, and people are subtle. This is why the Buddha says, "You are truly my children." This is **Absolute Subtle Precepts**.

## Notes

- The "clear cool pond" is a common metaphor for Nirvana: liberation from the burning of affliction.
- The "three-dot" symbol is the Siddham letter I, used in Tiantai to show mutual containment: realm, wisdom, and practice arise together, not in a line. This means even the Five Grades already touch the Perfect Realm and Perfect Wisdom.
