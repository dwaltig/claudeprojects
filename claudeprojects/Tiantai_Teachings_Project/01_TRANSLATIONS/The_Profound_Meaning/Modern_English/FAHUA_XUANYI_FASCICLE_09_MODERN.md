## Part One: Entering Real Contemplation Through the Round Gate

Zhiyi now turns from naming and substance to entering real contemplation through the Round Gate. First he distinguishes the gates, then he explains the round contemplation.

### Distinguishing the Four Gates

- **Tripitaka gate:** extinguishes form to reach the true, but invites contention.
- **Shared gate:** treats illusory form as true, pointing to non-contention.
- **Distinct gate:** moves sequentially, passing through the Middle in stages.
- **Round gate:** birth-and-death is Dharma-nature, Dharma-nature is the Middle. This is non-contentious.

### Ten Differences Between Distinct and Round

1. Integrated vs not integrated
2. Identical to dharmas vs not identical
3. Buddha wisdom vs non-Buddha wisdom
4. Non-sequential practice vs sequential practice
5. Not-cutting cutting vs progressive cutting
6. Provisional stages vs fixed stages
7. Non-vertical fruit vs vertical fruit
8. Round exposition vs partial exposition
9. Question and answer already reveal One Vehicle
10. Parables that include all gates at once

### Ten Marks of the Round Gate in the Lotus

1. Contemplate all dharmas as empty, as the Reality-Mark.
2. Worldly livelihoods do not contradict the Reality-Mark.
3. Open, show, awaken, enter Buddha knowledge and vision.
4. Wear the Tathagata’s robe, sit on his seat, dwell in his room.
5. Pass beyond five hundred yojanas.
6. Five grades and purity of six roots.
7. Ride the jeweled carriage and roam the four directions.
8. The Buddha abides in the Great Vehicle, adorned with meditation and wisdom.
9. With palms together, wish to hear the complete path.
10. The Reality-Mark teaching has already been spoken.

### The Four Marks of the Round Gate

1. Existence
2. Emptiness
3. Both existence and emptiness
4. Neither existence nor emptiness

These four gates are revealed as the Round Four Gates.

### Ten Contemplations for Entering the Real

1. Know the object of contemplation: birth-and-death is the inconceivable truth.
2. Arouse true resolve: great compassion and great vows.
3. Settle the mind: concentration and wisdom together.
4. Break through dharmas: cut obstructions like a diamond axe.
5. Know blockage and openness.
6. Know the factors of the path.
7. Apply antidotes: use truth as medicine.
8. Know the stages: from principle-Nirvana to ultimate realization.
9. Patient endurance: steady the mind against disturbance.
10. No attachment to dharmas: liberation, wisdom, and Dharma-body appear together.

## Part Two: Judging Gates as Coarse or Subtle

### Coarse and Subtle by Leading and Led

- Tripitaka gates: coarse leading and coarse led.
- Shared gates: subtle leading, coarse led.
- Distinct gates: coarse leading, subtle led.
- Perfect gates: subtle leading and subtle led.

### Coarse and Subtle by the Gates Themselves

A gate is subtle when it completes the Four Siddhantas and the ten contemplations; coarse when it misses them.

---

## Part Three: Opening Coarse to Reveal Subtle

When the teaching has matured its audience, the Lotus opens coarse gates to reveal the subtle gate as complete meaning.

---

## Part Four: The Reality-Mark as the Body of All Sutras

The Reality-Mark is the body of all sutras. This section has five topics: names, lateral and primary distinctions, comparisons, and coarse/subtle opening.

This sutra’s body is called Reality-Mark, Buddha knowledge and vision, great cause-and-condition, Dharma-seal, great vehicle, treasure ground, secret treasury, equal great wisdom, universal gate, and more. The names differ; the body is one.

Other sutras name the same body as ultimate emptiness, Tathagata treasury, Middle, and so on. The Lotus opens provisional names into the Reality-Mark.

---

## Part Five: The Body of Practices

Practice appears across the four teachings in two forms: faith-practice and principle-practice. Horizontal practices and staged practices both take the Reality-Mark as body. The Four Modes of Samadhi are grounded in the Reality-Mark.

Small practices are opened and revealed as subtle because the Lotus brings all practice into the one Reality-Mark.

---

## Part Six: The Body of All Dharmas

All dharmas take the Reality-Mark as body. The Four Truths encompass the full range of worldly and supramundane causes and effects. The body itself is wondrous and without difference, while dependent dharmas can be coarse or subtle by function.

---

## Part Seven: Essence (Third of the Five Chapters)

Essence is the throat of practice and the main cord of the net. It is not identical with substance. Essence means cause and fruit together.

### The Correct Essence

The Lotus establishes the disciples’ real cause in the Trace Gate and reveals the teacher’s real fruit in the Fundamental Gate. Cause is primary in the first half; fruit is primary in the second half. Together they form the sutra’s essence.

---

## Part Eight: Function (Fourth of the Five Chapters)

Function is the sutra’s power. This sutra’s unique power is breaking doubt and generating faith.

### Ten Uses of the Trace Gate

1. Breaking three, revealing one
2. Abandoning three, revealing one
3. Opening three, revealing one
4. Meeting three, revealing one
5. Abiding in one, revealing one
6. Abiding in three, revealing one
7. Abiding in neither-three-nor-one, revealing one
8. Covering three, revealing one
9. Abiding in three, using one
10. Abiding in one, using three

### Ten Uses of the Fundamental Gate

1. Breaking trace, revealing fundamental
2. Abandoning trace, revealing fundamental
3. Opening trace, revealing fundamental
4. Meeting trace, revealing fundamental
5. Abiding in fundamental, revealing fundamental
6. Abiding in trace, revealing fundamental
7. Abiding in neither-trace-nor-fundamental, revealing fundamental
8. Covering trace, revealing fundamental
9. Abiding in trace, using fundamental
10. Abiding in fundamental, using trace

### Connection to the Four Siddhantas

The ten uses map to the four Siddhantas. Each audience hears according to its kind, yet all are led to the One Vehicle.

## Notes

- The Lotus Sutra’s essence is One-Vehicle cause-and-fruit: Trace Gate (cause-primary) and Fundamental Gate (fruit-primary) together.
