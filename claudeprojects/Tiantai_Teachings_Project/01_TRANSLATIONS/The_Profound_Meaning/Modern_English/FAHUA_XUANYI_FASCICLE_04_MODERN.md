# The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra

## Fascicle 4 (Part 1)

**Modern English Version (Practitioners Edition)**

---

## Position Subtlety (Fourth Subtlety)

Principle is fused, wisdom is complete, and practice has become subtle. Why add Position? Because positions show the stages that practice actually climbs.

### Why Positions Matter

Positions appear across many sutras and treatises, but they are not all speaking the same language. Some texts map positions in a limited, single-line way. Others set out a broad ladder, but do not clearly distinguish coarse from subtle. The Lotus does not list positions by name, yet its meaning covers both expedient and real positions.

The Medicinal Herbs chapter provides the key: six positions that summarize the whole range of paths.

## The Six Positions in the Medicinal Herbs Parable

The parable describes small herbs, middle herbs, upper herbs, small trees, great trees, and the most real matter. These six positions map the entire progression:

| Position | Parable Image | Teaching | Content |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Small herbs | Tripitaka | Human and heavenly paths |
| 2 | Middle herbs | Tripitaka | Two Vehicles |
| 3 | Upper herbs | Tripitaka | Tripitaka bodhisattvas |
| 4 | Small trees | Shared | Three vehicles in the shared path |
| 5 | Great trees | Distinct | Distinct bodhisattva path |
| 6 | The most real matter | Perfect | One Vehicle, fully real |

Order matters: three Tripitaka positions, then Shared, then Distinct, then Perfect. This shows the progression from expedient to real.

## 1) Small Herbs: Human and Heavenly Positions

Small herbs represent the human and heavenly vehicle.

### Human Positions

The human path rests on the five precepts, with four levels of strength:

| Grade | Precept Quality | Reward |
|---|---|---|
| Lower | Basic five precepts | Iron-wheel king (one continent) |
| Middle | Moderate practice | Bronze-wheel king (two continents) |
| Upper | Strong practice | Silver-wheel king (three continents) |
| Highest | Excellent practice | Gold-wheel king (four continents) |

These are scattered-mind precepts, but combined with compassion and encouragement of others. The reward is human rulership and prosperity that naturally follows virtue.

### Heavenly Positions

Heavenly positions come from the ten wholesome paths. Adding meditation lifts one to higher heavens. The heights of the heavens match the depth of the causes.

---

## 2) Middle Herbs: The Two Vehicles

Middle herbs represent the Two Vehicles.

### Seven Worthy Ones

1. Five Stillings
2. Separate-aspect Mindfulness
3. General-aspect Mindfulness
4. Warmth
5. Summit
6. Patience
7. World-First Dharma

They are called worthy because they neighbor sagehood, using partial insight to subdue views and approach the true.

### Seven Sages

1. Following-Faith Practice
2. Following-Dharma Practice
3. Faith-Understanding
4. View-Attainment
5. Body-Witness
6. Time-Liberation Arhat
7. Non-Time-Liberation Arhat

They are called sages because true wisdom sees principle and crosses into sagehood.

---

## 3) Upper Herbs: Tripitaka Bodhisattvas

Upper herbs represent the Tripitaka bodhisattva path. From the first arousing of the bodhi mind, one vows compassion, contemplates the Four Noble Truths, and practices the six paramitas.

### The Three Incalculable Eons

- **First incalculable eon:** From Shakyamuni in past lives to Kashyapa Buddha. One still does not know for sure that Buddhahood will be reached.
- **Second incalculable eon:** From Kashyapa to Dipamkara. One knows one will become a Buddha but does not speak it.
- **Third incalculable eon:** From Dipamkara to Vipasyin. One speaks it openly without fear or hesitation.

## 4) Small Trees: Shared Teaching Ten Grounds

Small trees represent the Shared Teaching, where the three vehicles together use the wordless path, cut afflictions, and enter ultimate truth. The body-dharma contemplation is the same; differences lie in the strength of wisdom and the exhaustion of habits.

### Shared Teaching Ten Grounds

| # | Ground | Content |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Dry Wisdom | Body-dharma mindfulness, no samadhi-water yet |
| 2 | Nature | Warmth through World-First Dharma |
| 3 | Eight-Person | Eight patiences complete, one wisdom short |
| 4 | Seeing | Sees ultimate non-arising Four Truths |
| 5 | Thin | Desire-realm afflictions thinned |
| 6 | Free-from-Desire | Five lower fetters exhausted |
| 7 | Done-What-Is-To-Be-Done | All three-realm afflictions cut |
| 8 | Pratyekabuddha | Encroaches on habitual tendencies |
| 9 | Bodhisattva | Exits emptiness into provisional, dual observation |
| 10 | Buddha | One thought completes all |

---

## 5) Great Trees: Distinct Teaching Positions

Great trees represent the Distinct Teaching. Names, meanings, principle, delusion, wisdom, and cutting are all distinct. This path teaches dependent-origination provisional names, Ganges-sands Buddha dharmas, Tathagatagarbha principle, eternal-abiding Nirvana, and immeasurable Four Truths, all arranged in a clear sequence. Distinct means sequential: one position follows another in fixed order. At this stage the Middle is seen as above or beyond the extremes. Only in the Perfect Teaching is the Middle seen within every extreme.

### Distinct Teaching Fifty-Two Positions

| Stage | Positions | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Ten Faiths | 1-10 | Outer ordinary, dry wisdom, subduing patience |
| Ten Abidings | 11-20 | Inner ordinary, habit-seed nature |
| Ten Practices | 21-30 | Nature-seed nature |
| Ten Dedications | 31-40 | Way-seed nature |
| Ten Grounds | 41-50 | Sage-seed nature |
| Equal Awakening | 51 | Diamond-mind, nearly Buddha |
| Wondrous Awakening | 52 | Ultimate Buddhahood |

## 6) The Most Real Matter: Perfect Teaching Position

The parable says one ground gives rise to all, one rain moistens all, and the Buddha will now speak the most real matter. This final position is the Perfect Teaching: the One Vehicle, fully real.

---

## Coarse and Subtle Judgment

When the coarse is opened into the subtle, there is no coarse left to contrast. This is the meaning of Absolute Practice Subtlety.

---

## Notes

- The Six Positions from the Medicinal Herbs chapter provide the framework that unifies the range of paths under one Dharma rain, each according to its readiness.
