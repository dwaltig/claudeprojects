# The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra

## Fascicle 2 (Modern English for Practitioners)

# Part I: The Six Meanings of Cause and Fruit

## 1) The Three Meanings of Cause

Cause has three meanings:

1) **Breadth of substance**: One Dharma-Realm contains nine Dharma-Realms.  
2) **Height of position**: The nine Dharma-Realms are precisely the Buddha Dharma-Realm.  
3) **Length of function**: The Ten Dharma-Realms are precisely emptiness, provisional, and Middle.

So: one is three, three is one. Not separate, not flat, not singular. That is why it is called **Wonderful**.

## 2) The Three Meanings of Fruit

Fruit also has three meanings:

1) **Breadth of substance**: It pervades all places.  
2) **Height of position**: Buddhahood was attained long ago, beyond ordinary time.  
3) **Length of function**: From the Fundamental, the Trace descends, benefiting past, present, and future.

Together, these are the **six meanings of cause and fruit**. This is different from other sutras. That is why it is called **Wonderful**.

# Part II: Five Flavors and the Coarse/Wonderful Contrast

The Five Flavors show how cause-and-fruit are taught in stages:

- **Milk (Avatamsaka)**: one coarse, one wonderful.  
- **Curds (Tripitaka)**: only coarse.  
- **Fresh Butter (Vaipulya)**: three coarse, one wonderful.  
- **Clarified Butter (Prajna)**: two coarse, one wonderful.  
- **Ghee (Lotus)**: only wonderful.

In the Lotus, the wonderful cause and wonderful fruit stand alone and complete.

# Part III: Observing the Mind

When you look at your own mind:

- If it does **not** contain the minds of beings and the Buddha, that is **narrow substance**.  
- If it **does**, that is **broad substance**.

If your mind is **not equal** to the Buddha’s mind, that is **low position**.  
If it **is equal**, that is **high position**.

If these minds are **not** precisely emptiness, provisional, and Middle, that is **short function**.  
If they **are**, that is **long function**.

### The Four Unities

1) **Unity of principle**: Ten Dharma-Realms inside one Dharma-Realm.  
2) **Unity of teaching**: Five Flavors are one teaching.  
3) **Unity of practice**: Observing the mind is the direct practice.  
4) **Unity of person**: Six Stages of Identity unfold from that one mind.

The **Six Stages of Identity** are:  
- **Principle** (the truth is already present),  
- **Name** (you can name it),  
- **Practice** (you train it),  
- **Resemblance** (you begin to embody it),  
- **Partial realization** (genuine awakening begins),  
- **Ultimate realization** (full Buddhahood).

# Part IV: The Three Wonderful Dharmas

Master Nanyue names three:

1) **Sentient Being Dharma**  
2) **Buddha Dharma**  
3) **Mind Dharma**

## 1) Sentient Being Dharma is Wonderful

The Lotus shows that the **five eyes** can arise in sentient beings.  
The *Nirvana Sutra* and *Prajna* confirm this.

**CBETA order of proof:**  
- Lotus eye-passages → Nirvana eye-language → Prajna “all dharmas tend toward the eye.”

The conclusion: **the Buddha’s knowledge and vision is already stored in beings**.

## 2) Buddha Dharma is Wonderful

The Buddha says: “My Dharma is subtle and hard to know.”

- **Real Wisdom**: reveals the Reality-Mark.  
- **Provisional Wisdom**: guides beings into it.

Only a Buddha fully knows this. Therefore **Buddha Dharma is Wonderful**.

## 3) Mind Dharma is Wonderful

Mind holds the whole field:

- The Lotus: peaceful practices and the single moment of joy.  
- The Samantabhadra Contemplation: “Mind is empty; sins and merits have no master.”  
- The Vimalakirti: “Contemplate the body’s Reality-Mark; the Buddha is also like this.”  
- The Avatamsaka: “Mind, Buddha, and beings are not different.”

Therefore **Mind Dharma is Wonderful**.

# Part V: Ten Suchnesses and the Three Truths

The Lotus lists ten suchnesses:

- mark, nature, substance, power, function, cause, condition, effect, retribution, ultimate equality.

Zhiyi reads them in **three turns**:

1) **“The mark is suchness … retribution is suchness.”**  
2) **“Suchness of mark … suchness of retribution.”**  
3) **“The mark is thus … the retribution is thus.”**

### The Three Truths inside the Three Readings

- If everything is called “suchness,” that is **Emptiness**.  
- If each mark is named in its own way, that is **Provisional**.  
- If “thus” is the Reality-Mark, that is **Middle**.

So: **Emptiness, Provisional, and Middle are mutually inclusive**.
These are not three separate passes through the text. They are **simultaneous** in every mark and every detail.

# Part VI: Ten Dharma-Realms

The Ten Dharma-Realms explain how Provisional and Real inter-contain:

1) All ten depend on the Dharma-Realm.  
2) They differ by cause and effect, ordinary and sage.  
3) Each one is precisely the Dharma-Realm itself.

This yields **one hundred realms and one thousand suchnesses**.

To reach the full Tiantai structure, these are seen across **three realms of existence**:  
1) **Sentient beings**,  
2) **The five aggregates**,  
3) **The lands where experience appears**.  
This completes the foundation for **three thousand realms in one moment of thought**.

The Buddha alone fully knows this, because sentient beings can look coarse yet carry ripened good, or look good yet carry ripened evil. This is why **Sentient Being Dharma is Wonderful**.

---

# Part VII: The Two Meanings of “Wonderful”

Zhiyi recognizes two kinds:

1) **Relative Wonderful**: contrasts half vs. full, small vs. great.  
2) **Absolute Wonderful**: nothing to contrast; everything is already Wonderful.

The Lotus uses both, but always returns to **Absolute Wonderful**.

# Closing Note for Practitioners

This fascicle teaches a three-level move:

1) **See the structure** (cause/fruit, five flavors, ten suchnesses).  
2) **See the mind** (your mind already holds the Dharma-Realm).  
3) **See the unity** (all dharmas point to the Reality-Mark).

Observing the mind is the bridge. Without it, Ten Suchnesses are just numbers. With it, they become the texture of your current experience.
When that unity is clear, “Wonderful” is no longer a label. It becomes how you live and practice.
