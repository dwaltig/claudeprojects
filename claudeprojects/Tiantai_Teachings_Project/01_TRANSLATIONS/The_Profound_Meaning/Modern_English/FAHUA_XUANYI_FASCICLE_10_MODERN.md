# The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra

## Fascicle 10: Teaching Classification -- Five Periods and Eight Teachings

**Modern English Version (Practitioners Edition)**

---

## The Fifth Chapter: Teaching Classification

If one teaches other sutras, classification is helpful but not required. If one teaches the Lotus, classification is essential; without it, the text’s meaning remains incomplete.

Zhiyi lays out five parts:

1. Overall meaning
2. Differing interpretations
3. Difficulties and refutations
4. What to accept and reject
5. Final classification

## Three Great Structures

### 1) Three Kinds of Teaching

- **Sudden:** direct teaching without stages
- **Gradual:** step-by-step teaching
- **Indeterminate:** neither fixed sudden nor gradual

### 2) Five Periods (Five Flavors)

| Period | Teaching | Flavor |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Avatamsaka (for high bodhisattvas) | Milk |
| 2 | Agamas (Tripitaka for Two Vehicles) | Curds |
| 3 | Vaipulya (scolding small, praising great) | Fresh Butter |
| 4 | Prajnaparamita (emptiness for all) | Clarified Butter |
| 5 | Lotus and Nirvana (ultimate) | Ghee |

### 3) Four Teachings

| Teaching | Characteristic |
|---|---|
| Tripitaka | Analytical emptiness |
| Shared | Embodied emptiness |
| Distinct | Sequential Middle |
| Perfect | Immediate Middle |

## Critique of Other Systems

Zhiyi surveys ten competing classification schemes and refutes them in order. Each fails either by ignoring explicit texts or by collapsing expedients.

---

## Difficulties and Refutations (in Sequence)

1. **South five-period scheme:** misreads early teachings and misplaces Lotus and Nirvana.
2. **South four-period scheme:** collapses distinct phases into one.
3. **South three-period scheme:** erases the Lotus role of opening three and returning to one.
4. **North five-period scheme:** misclassifies early texts and their results.
5. **Half/Full scheme:** cannot explain why Lotus is unique.
6. **Four Tenets:** weak scriptural support and blurred categories.
7. **Five Tenets:** adds a highest category that earlier texts already teach.
8. **Six Tenets:** splits true and round into contradiction.
9. **Two Great Vehicles:** cannot separate marks and no-marks without contradiction.
10. **One Sound teaching:** erases skillful means and variety of capacities.

---

## What to Accept and Reject

**Accept:**

- Five Flavors as expedient order, when paired with Half/Full.
- Half/Full as real intent, when paired with Five Flavors.
- Four Teachings as doctrinal map aligned with Five Flavors.

**Reject:**

- Any system that replaces the Lotus as final.
- Any system that erases expedients.
- Any system that privileges one gate while ignoring the other three.

## The Correct Teaching Classification

### The Three Proofs

1. **Skillful Means + Intro:** sudden first, then gradual.
2. **Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings:** sequence of Four Truths to Prajna.
3. **Trust-and-Understanding:** parable mirrors Five Flavors.

### Five Flavors and Half/Full Combined

| Period | Flavor | Half/Full |
|---|---|---|
| Huayan | Milk | Full only |
| Agamas | Curds | Half only |
| Vaipulya | Fresh Butter | Half and Full opposed |
| Prajna | Clarified Butter | Carrying half, discussing full |
| Lotus | Ghee | Abandoning half, clarifying full |

**Logic:**

- Full appears from the start, but beings need expedient half-teachings to mature.
- Each period refines capacity toward the Lotus.

---

## Opening and Combining

One Vehicle is opened into many, then returned to one. Zhiyi applies this by number:

- **Two:** Half and Full
- **Three:** One opened into three, returned to one
- **Four:** Four teachings or four gates
- **Five:** Five flavors
- **Six to Eight:** six perfections, seven factors, eightfold path

### Combining or Not Combining

- **Huayan:** not combined (full only)
- **Agamas:** not combined (half only)
- **Vaipulya:** not combined (half hears full but does not enter)
- **Prajna:** combined in dharma, not in person
- **Lotus:** fully combined (people and dharma)
- **Nirvana:** both combined and not combined (keeps expedients)

### Broad vs Specific

- **Specific:** each flavor has a fixed place.
- **Broad:** each flavor can extend earlier and later.

## The Master’s Conclusion

Zhiyi closes by saying this is only a rough statement of what he holds. Words cannot fully express meaning. If one penetrates the Ten Subtleties and follows the interlocking logic of the chapters, the path of perfect penetration opens here.

## Notes

- The Five Periods are the temporal ordering of the Buddha’s teaching career.
- The Four Teachings are the doctrinal map used to read the Five Periods.
- The complete system is Five Periods plus Half/Full plus Four Teachings.
