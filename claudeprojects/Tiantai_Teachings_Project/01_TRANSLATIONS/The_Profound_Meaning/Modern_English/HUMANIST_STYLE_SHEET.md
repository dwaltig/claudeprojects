# Humanist Style Sheet - Modern English (Practitioners/Seekers)

## Purpose
Create a modern, plainspoken edition for practitioners/seekers that preserves Tiantai logic and doctrinal structure while improving clarity and readability.

## Core Rules
- Preserve doctrinal logic, sequence, and pivots from CBETA.
- Keep the Five Chapters / Ten Subtleties / Four Siddhantas / Four Gates / Three Truths frameworks intact.
- Use Modern English, plainspoken tone, short sentences, and active voice.
- English-only output. No Chinese characters.
- Keep key terms stable across fascicles using the glossary.

## Terminology Standards (Scholarly -> Modern)
- Reality-Mark -> Reality-Mark (keep)
- Three Truths -> Three Truths (keep)
- Middle -> Middle (keep)
- Nirvana -> Nirvana (no diacritics)
- Dharma-Realm -> Dharma-Realm (keep)
- Four Siddhantas -> Four Siddhantas (keep)
- Four Gates -> Four Gates (keep)
- Opening/Combining -> Opening/Combining (keep)
- Coarse/Subtle -> Coarse/Subtle (keep)
- Trace/Fundamental -> Trace/Fundamental (keep)

## Metaphors
- Keep if clear to modern readers (net/cord, mirror, rain, seed).
- Adapt if archaic or confusing (e.g., "plumb-line" -> "straightedge"), but only if meaning is preserved.
- If adapted, keep the original metaphor's function and logic.

## Structure
- Reorganize headers for clarity, but preserve CBETA sequence.
- Use short sections and numbered steps for long arguments.
- Add brief transition lines when logic shifts (no doctrinal additions).

## Output
- Create modern files in:
  /Users/williamaltig/claudeprojects/Tiantai_Teachings_Project/01_TRANSLATIONS/The_Profound_Meaning/Modern_English/
- File naming: FAHUA_XUANYI_FASCICLE_XX_MODERN.md
- Each file stands alone, no references to Chinese text.

## Review Process
- Produce Fascicle 1 as pilot.
- Incorporate feedback before proceeding to Fascicles 2-10.
