# Part I: Preface and Orientation

## 1) Why Zhiyi Matters (Guanding’s Preface)

When the Dharma came east, how many people could understand the Buddha Vehicle without even hearing a lecture?
Even if someone awakened, could they enter samadhi and gain dharani?
Even with concentration and wisdom, could they teach in the capital?
Even if their assemblies flourished, could they dismiss their students and live in seclusion?
Even while living quietly, could they be invited to serve as National Preceptor to two dynasties?
Even if honored by emperors, could they teach the *Renwang Prajnaparamita Sutra* in the great hall?
Even if proclaiming the Dharma, could they receive the ruler’s three prostrations?
Even if a ruler of ten thousand chariots knelt, could a hundred officials praise them with snapping fingers?
Even with monks and laypeople attentive, could they awaken to the Perfect Meaning of the Lotus Sutra?
Even if they grasped the Sutra’s meaning, could they teach without leaning on words, pouring forth the Dharma day and night?

Only Master Zhiyi had all these virtues.

## 2) Guanding’s Personal Testimony

I, Guanding, first heard the teachings in Jianye. Later in Jiangling, I received the *Profound Meaning*. In my later years, I returned to Mount Tiantai only to find the “Crane Grove” (a traditional way of saying the Master had passed away).

I traveled back and forth between Jing and Yang--nearly ten thousand li--gathering teachings from before and after. I only heard the full exposition once.
Even what I heard, I did not fully understand. Rolling and unrolling the text, studying and contemplating, I felt its depth and height. Yet I mourned my shallow connection--unable to ask again, with no place to inquire--like a calf longing for milk.

I feared these words might be lost. Future generations would suffer if they vanished.
The *Nirvana Sutra* speaks of inscribing the Dharma on trees and stones; this Sutra speaks of planting seeds in fields and villages. Following the sacred texts, I wrote them down to transmit them: the *Profound Meaning* and the *Textual Commentary*, each in ten fascicles.

Some passages use sutras and treatises to accord with this profound teaching. Others list different masters’ views and show they are not Perfect. Future practitioners will know the Gate of Sweet Dew is here.

## 3) The “King’s Preface” -- Six Lotus Metaphors

### What “Wonderful Dharma” Means

- **Wonderful** means the inconceivable.
- **Dharma** is the Dharma of the Ten Dharma-Realms, Ten Suchnesses, and Provisional and Real.
- **Lotus** is a metaphor for Provisional and Real.

Because the Wonderful Dharma is hard to grasp, the Lotus is used as a clear image.

### The Six Metaphors (Three + Three)

**Trace Gate (three metaphors):**  
1) **For the sake of the real, provide the provisional.**  
2) **Open the provisional, reveal the real.**  
3) **Abolish the provisional, establish the real.**

**Fundamental Gate (three metaphors):**  
1) **From the fundamental, the trace descends.**  
2) **Open the trace, reveal the fundamental.**  
3) **Abolish the trace, establish the fundamental.**

### The Result

The Lotus metaphor does this:
- Sweeps away rigid attachment to the “Conjured City.”
- Breaks stagnation in the “Grass Hut.”
- Opens the Provisional and reveals the Real.
- Gathers small practices into the One Vehicle.
- Gives prediction to beings of all capacities.

It also reveals the Buddha’s original ground.
Thus the path grows and birth-and-death diminishes. The practitioner’s stage draws near to Great Awakening.

## 4) Guanding’s Commentary on the Preface

The preface explains the Sutra’s profound meaning.
The heart of that meaning is Trace and Fundamental.

The six metaphors map to the Five Chapters:
- **Name** → “Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower.”
- **Substance** → Revealing the Reality-Mark.
- **Essence** → Returning to the One Vehicle.
- **Function** → Sweeping away the Conjured City.
- **Teaching** → The complete transformation period.

The text is concise, but the meaning is complete.

# Part II: The Main Teaching

## 1) The Five Chapters

1. **Interpreting the Name**  
2. **Discerning the Substance**  
3. **Clarifying the Essence**  
4. **Discussing the Function**  
5. **Classifying the Teaching**

These five are used in two ways:
- **General**: applies to all sutras.
- **Particular**: applies specifically to this Sutra.

The general explanation uses **seven shared interpretations**:
1) Establishing the chapters  
2) Citing evidence  
3) Demonstrating the arising  
4) Opening and combining  
5) Critical discrimination  
6) Observing the mind  
7) Reconciling differences

### What Each Interpretation Builds

- **Establishing chapters** → faith (a stable anchor for the path).  
- **Citing evidence** → faith.  
- **Demonstrating arising** → concentration.  
- **Opening/combining, discrimination, reconciling** → wisdom.  
- **Observing the mind** → vigor.

These five minds become the Five Faculties and open the Three Gates of Liberation.

## 2) Interpreting the Name

### A) Establishing
Names open what is profound and guide beginners toward the ultimate. Names point to the Dharma so beings can approach it.

### B) Distinguishing Coarse and Wonderful

- If the Three Truths are separated and sequential → **coarse**.
- If the Three Truths are perfectly interfused → **wonderful**.

This Wonderful Truth is originally present. The Buddha knows it but does not teach it too soon, because beings could reject it and fall into the lower paths.

### The Four-Step Progression (CBETA sequence)

These four steps correspond to the first four periods (Huayan, Agama, Vaipulya, Prajna):\n\n1) **Huayan** sets up integrated and non-integrated, but those of lesser capacity do not hear it.  \n2) **Agama** establishes only the non-integrated; the great do not use it.  \n3) **Vaipulya** uses the integrated to shame attachment to the non-integrated.  \n4) **Prajna** lets the small rely on the integrated and the great move into it.

These are all skillful means. The Lotus sets aside the non-integrated and speaks only the integrated--this is the Buddha’s original intent.

### C) Concluding
- *Avatamsaka* **includes** the One Vehicle alongside the separate vehicles.  
- *Tripitaka* **teaches only** the separate vehicles.  
- *Vaipulya* **contrasts** Great and Small.  
- *Prajna* **carries** the Three while revealing the One.  
- The *Lotus* does **not** mix, contrast, or carry--it is **exclusive** (pure) in stating the One Vehicle.

### D) The Lotus Metaphor
Other flowers are coarse. The Lotus is unique because it already includes the fruit when the flower appears. It points to a Dharma where Provisional and Real are one.

## 3) Discerning the Substance

The Substance is the Reality-Mark.

Many interpretations are rejected because they are too broad or only partial.
Zhiyi keeps the Buddha’s own view: **the Reality-Mark is the true Substance.**

He supports this with passages from the Lotus and related sutras:
- The Buddha emits light to reveal the Reality-Mark.  
- Only Buddha with Buddha can fully fathom it.  
- Opening the expedient gate reveals it.

---

## 4) Clarifying the Essence

Essence is **Buddha’s own cause and fruit**--the path and its full realization.

It is the net’s main cord: lift the cord and all the mesh follows.

---

## 5) Discussing the Function

Function is the Sutra’s power to **break doubt and generate faith**.

This happens through the Buddha’s wisdom:
- **Real Wisdom** clarifies the Reality-Mark.  
- **Provisional Wisdom** guides beings into it.

# Closing Note for Practitioners

This fascicle teaches you how to read the Lotus in a living way:
- It shows **why the Buddha teaches in stages**.
- It shows **what is ultimately being revealed**.
- It shows **how the One Vehicle gathers everything**.

If you hold that sequence, the rest of the text becomes clear.
