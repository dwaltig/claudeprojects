# The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra (妙法蓮華經玄義)
## Fascicle 7: Fundamental and Trace (本迹) — The Eternal and the Manifest

## The Second Half of the Jewel

The Ten Trace Subtleties covered the Buddha's **manifest teaching**—what he did from the moment of "becoming Buddha" under the bodhi tree.

Now we enter the Ten Fundamental Subtleties—the Buddha's **eternal reality** revealed in Chapter 16, "Lifespan of the Tathāgata."

This is the secret the Buddha kept until the final gathering: **He didn't just become Buddha under that tree. He became Buddha incalculably long ago.**

## Six Ways to Understand "Fundamental" and "Trace"

Master Zhiyi offers six angles:

| Angle | Fundamental | Trace |
|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Principle** | Reality-mark itself | Everything else |
| **Principle + Event** | Both principle and event | Teaching about them |
| **Teaching + Practice** | The teaching | Practice based on it |
| **Body + Function** | The substance | Its activity |
| **Real + Provisional** | Actually attained | Provisionally displayed |
| **Now + Before** | What's revealed today | What was said before |

The key: **Trace is not false.** Trace arises from Fundamental. Following Trace leads back to Fundamental.

## The Ten Fundamental Subtleties

| # | Subtlety | What It Addresses |
|---|----------|-------------------|
| 1 | **Fundamental Cause** | The Buddha's original practice |
| 2 | **Fundamental Fruit** | The Buddha's original awakening |
| 3 | **Fundamental Land** | Where the Buddha originally dwells |
| 4 | **Fundamental Resonance** | Original stimulus-response capacity |
| 5 | **Fundamental Powers** | Original supernatural abilities |
| 6 | **Fundamental Teaching** | Original Dharma-exposition |
| 7 | **Fundamental Retinue** | Original disciples |
| 8 | **Fundamental Nirvāṇa** | Original extinction/non-extinction |
| 9 | **Fundamental Lifespan** | Original limitless lifespan |
| 10 | **Fundamental Benefits** | Original benefiting of beings |

## What's Different About the Fundamental Subtleties?

### Structure Shift

In the Trace Subtleties, five items addressed **cause** (Realm, Wisdom, Practice, Position, Three Dharmas).

Here, **Cause** is condensed into one subtlety, while **Nirvāṇa** and **Lifespan** are added as separate items.

Why? Because the revelation of Chapter 16 is precisely about nirvāṇa and lifespan:

> "Since I became Buddha, immeasurably long ago, I have constantly been on Vulture Peak. I have never really entered nirvāṇa—I only say I do to benefit beings."

---

### Brushing Away Traces

The key move of the Fundamental Gate:

> "If we retained the intermediate causes, later practitioners would find it hard to believe. Hence the *Lotus* **brushes away traces to remove doubt**."

Everything before Chapter 16—even the sixteen princes, even the great bodhichitta stories—is revealed as **intermediate**, not Fundamental.

> "Only Buddha can know such remoteness—all these are **Trace Causes, not Fundamental Cause**."

---

## The Fundamental Sahā

One of the most striking claims:

> "The text says: 'Since then, I have always been in this Sahā world.' According to this, it's really **not today's Trace-Sahā**—it is **Fundamental Sahā**."

The world we experience is a trace of the Buddha's eternal abiding. Even this defiled land is, at its foundation, the Buddha's Pure Land.

---

## The Refrain

Throughout Fascicle 7, Master Zhiyi repeats:

> "**本迹雖殊，不思議一**"
> "Fundamental and Trace, though different, are inconceivably one."

This is the non-dual key. We don't reject the Trace to find the Fundamental. We understand that:
1. Trace emerges from Fundamental
2. Following Trace reveals Fundamental
3. They were never really two things

## Practice Prompt

**This week, work with "Fundamental and Trace":**

### Days 1-2: Your Own Traces
What are the "traces" of your practice—the visible actions, the meditation sessions, the study? Notice these as traces.

### Days 3-4: What They Trace To
What is the "Fundamental" behind your traces? What is the deep motivation, the Buddha-nature, the reality-mark that your practice traces back to?

### Days 5-7: Non-Dual
Can you hold both simultaneously? The traces are real—and the Fundamental is real—and they're not two different things?

**The key insight**: The manifest Buddha (eating, teaching, dying) traces back to an eternal Buddha who never wasn't awakened. Our own practice traces back to a Buddha-nature that never wasn't present.
