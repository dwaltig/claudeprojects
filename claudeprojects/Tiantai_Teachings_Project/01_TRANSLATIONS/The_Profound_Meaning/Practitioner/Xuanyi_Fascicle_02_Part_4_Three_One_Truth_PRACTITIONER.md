# The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra (妙法蓮華經玄義)
## Fascicle 2, Part 4: Three Truths, One Truth, and No-Truth

## The Three Truths: Why Two Wasn't Enough

The Two Truths (conventional and ultimate) work well enough for cutting through basic confusion. But for the full path, Master Zhiyi teaches **Three Truths**:

1. **Emptiness** (空) — Everything lacks inherent existence
2. **Provisional Existence** (假) — Yet everything functions and arises
3. **Middle** (中) — Both are true simultaneously, without contradiction

The first two truths can become one-sided:
- Get stuck in emptiness → nihilism, detachment, "nothing matters"
- Get stuck in provisional → attachment, materialism, "this is all real"

The Middle isn't a compromise. It's seeing that **emptiness and provisional existence are the same thing from different angles**.

## Five Types of Three Truths

### Type 1: Distinct-Entering-Common (別入通)

| Truth | What It Is |
|-------|------------|
| Conventional | With-outflows (defiled dharmas) |
| Ultimate | Without-outflows (purified dharmas) |
| Middle | Neither—but **empty of function** |

The Middle here is just "different from emptiness." It doesn't contain anything; it's an escape hatch, not a embrace.

---

### Type 2: Perfect-Entering-Common (圓入通)

Same as above, but the Middle now **contains all dharmas**.

This is a big upgrade. The Middle isn't empty of content—it's pregnant with everything.

---

### Type 3: Distinct (別)

Here we split the conventional truth into two, and the Middle becomes "principle only."

Good progress, but still abstract. The Middle is an idea, not a living reality.

---

### Type 4: Perfect-Entering-Distinct (圓入別)

The Middle now **fully contains Buddha-dharma**.

Getting closer. The Middle isn't just a concept—it's where all Buddha qualities reside.

---

### Type 5: Perfect (圓)

> "Not only does the Middle Way fully contain Buddha-dharma, but truth and conventional also do. **The Three Truths are perfectly interfused—one is three, three is one.**"

This is the Tiantai signature. In the Perfect Three Truths:
- **Emptiness** contains provisional and middle
- **Provisional** contains emptiness and middle
- **Middle** contains emptiness and provisional

Any one of them gives you all three. That's called **perfect interfusion** (圓融).

### The Five-Flavor Distribution

| Flavor | Types of Three Truths | Coarse/Subtle |
|--------|----------------------|---------------|
| Milk (*Avataṃsaka*) | 3 types | 2 coarse, 1 subtle |
| Curds (*Tripiṭaka*) | None | Only coarse |
| Fresh/Clarified Butter | All 5 types | 4 coarse, 1 subtle |
| **Ghee (*Lotus*)** | **1 type only** | **Only subtle** |

## The One Truth: Drunk vs. Sober

Here's Master Zhiyi's famous simile:

> "What is called 'Two Truths' is actually one; we expediently speak of two. **It is like a drunk who has not yet vomited, seeing the sun and moon spinning, saying there is a 'spinning sun' and a 'non-spinning sun.'**"

Think about that:
- The drunk sees two things: one spinning, one not
- There's actually only one sun—it's not spinning at all
- **The "two" is the drunk's confusion, not reality**

> "A sober person only sees non-spinning, not spinning. The two that spin are coarse; the non-spinning is subtle."

The Tripiṭaka is like the drunk—everything seems to be two (real/unreal, defiled/pure, suffering/cessation).

The Mahāyāna sūtras are like someone starting to sober up—still seeing some spinning, but knowing there's a non-spinning reality.

The **Lotus Sutra** is completely sober:

> "This present sūtra straightforwardly abandons expedients, only teaching the unsurpassed Way—the non-spinning One Reality."

---

## No-Truth: When Even "One" Is Too Many

But Master Zhiyi doesn't stop at One Truth. He goes further:

> "All dharmas from the beginning constantly have the mark of extinction—how could there be various truths in confused mutual obstruction? **If one truth does not exist, how could various truths exist?**"

What can be spoken is coarse.
What cannot be spoken is subtle.
**"Cannot be spoken" also cannot be spoken—this is subtle.**
**"This subtle" is also subtle, because the path of words is cut off.**

This is the famous **fourfold unspeakability**:

| Pattern | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Arising-arising cannot be spoken | The wheel of generation |
| Arising-non-arising cannot be spoken | Birth leading to peace |
| Non-arising-arising cannot be spoken | Peace manifesting activity |
| Non-arising-non-arising cannot be spoken | Complete stillness |

All four are unspeakable. The first three are relatively coarse; the last is subtle. But if you think coarse and subtle are different, you're still caught in relativity.

> "Coarse and subtle not being two—this is Absolute Wonderful."

---

## A Crucial Clarification

**Q:** If even the One Truth can be "broken" by no-truth, doesn't that mean nothing is safe?

**A:** Here's the key distinction:

> "We do not break the nirvāṇa attained in the sage's mind. For those who have not attained it and cling to nirvāṇa, generating idle talk—we break their clinging."

The truth isn't the problem. **Clinging to the truth** is the problem.

For the person who has truly realized, there is truth.
For the person making philosophical arguments about truth, there is no-truth.

> "For those who have truly attained, there is [truth]; for those engaged in idle talk, there is not."

## The Complete Journey of Realm Subtlety

We've now covered all six ways Master Zhiyi analyzes "Realm" (境):

| # | Realm | What It Teaches |
|---|-------|-----------------|
| 1 | Ten Suchnesses | The ten aspects of all phenomena |
| 2 | Dependent Origination | How suffering arises and ceases (4 types) |
| 3 | Four Noble Truths | The diagnosis and cure (4 types) |
| 4 | Two Truths | Conventional and ultimate (7 types) |
| 5 | Three Truths | Emptiness, provisional, middle (5 types) |
| 6 | One Truth / No-Truth | The non-spinning reality |

Each realm goes deeper. Each one drops more baggage. By the end, even "truth" is let go.

## Practice Prompt

**This week, work with "sobriety":**

### Days 1-2: Notice the Spinning
Where in your life do you see "two" that might actually be one?
- Success and failure
- Self and other
- Practice and daily life

Don't try to fix it. Just notice.

### Days 3-4: Perfect Interfusion
Take one truth you know well (emptiness, impermanence, dependent origination). Ask: does this truth contain everything else? Can you find the other truths *inside* this one?

### Days 5-7: The Path of Words Cut
Sit quietly. Let a word arise: "peace," "Buddha," "truth."
Now ask: can this word capture what it points to?
Let it go. Sit in what the word pointed to but couldn't capture.

That's No-Truth. Not philosophy—experience.

## End of Fascicle 2

We've completed the **Realm Subtlety** (境妙)—the first of the Ten Trace Subtleties.

Next: **Wisdom Subtlety** (智妙)—the twenty kinds of wisdom that arise from knowing the realm.
