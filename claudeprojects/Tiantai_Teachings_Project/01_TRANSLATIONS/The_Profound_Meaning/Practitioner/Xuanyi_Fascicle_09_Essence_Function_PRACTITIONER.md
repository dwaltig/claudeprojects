# The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra (妙法蓮華經玄義)
## Fascicle 9: Essence (宗) and Function (用) — The Aim and Power

**Practitioner Translation by The Practitioner**

> *"This sūtra's great function is most heroic and fierce."*

## What Is the Sūtra About? (Essence/宗)

Master Zhiyi now asks: **What is the AIM of the *Lotus Sūtra*?**

He distinguishes this from Substance:
- **Substance** = What the sūtra IS (Reality-Mark)
- **Essence** = What the sūtra DOES (One-Vehicle Cause-and-Fruit)

### The Correct Answer: One-Vehicle Cause-and-Fruit

The sūtra has two halves:

| Half | Chapters | Focus | What It Does |
|------|----------|-------|--------------|
| **Trace Gate** | 1-14 | **CAUSE** primary | Establishes disciples' real cause (bodhicitta, practices) |
| **Fundamental Gate** | 15-28 | **FRUIT** primary | Reveals the Teacher's real fruit (eternal Buddha) |

> "**Combining both cause-and-fruit together makes the sūtra's Essence.**"

---

## What Is the Sūtra's Power? (Function/用)

### The Answer: Breaking Doubt, Generating Faith (斷疑生信)

> "The Tathāgata takes **expedient-and-real two wisdoms** as subtle ability. This sūtra takes **breaking doubt and generating faith** as superior power."

This sūtra does what no other can:
- **Purely reveals Buddha's wisdom** (not mixed with other vehicles)
- **Purely opens Buddha's knowledge-and-vision** (not the nine lower realms)
- **Breaks the Two-Vehicle fruit** (not just adjusts it)
- **Reveals the eternal Buddha** (not just the manifest one)

## Twenty Uses: Ten for Each Gate

### The Trace Gate's Ten Uses

| # | Name | Plain English |
|---|------|---------------|
| 1 | **Breaking three** | "Your three-vehicle attachment is wrong" |
| 2 | **Abandoning three** | "The three-vehicle teaching is now set aside" |
| 3 | **Opening three** | "Look—the three were always the one" |
| 4 | **Meeting three** | "All your practices join into one" |
| 5 | **Abiding in one** | "This was always my original intent" |
| 6 | **Abiding in three** | "I skillfully used three to lead to one" |
| 7 | **Neither-three-nor-one** | "Transcend the category entirely" |
| 8 | **Covering three** | "I preserve the expedient for future use" |
| 9 | **Disciples in three** | "You abide in expedient while using real" |
| 10 | **Vow to use three** | "I vowed to teach three in this defiled world" |

### The Fundamental Gate's Ten Uses

Same structure, but now about **Trace vs. Fundamental**:

| # | Name | Plain English |
|---|------|---------------|
| 1 | **Breaking trace** | "Your view of the Buddha under the bodhi tree is wrong" |
| 2 | **Abandoning trace** | "The teaching about 'just becoming Buddha' is set aside" |
| 3 | **Opening trace** | "Look—the trace was always pointing to the fundamental" |
| 4 | **Meeting trace** | "All the intermediate manifestations join into one original" |
| 5 | **Abiding in fundamental** | "I've always been the eternal Buddha" |
| 6 | **Abiding in trace** | "I skillfully used manifestation to reveal the eternal" |
| 7 | **Neither-trace-nor-fundamental** | "Transcend the category entirely" |
| 8 | **Covering trace** | "I preserve the trace for future use" |
| 9 | **In trace, using fundamental** | "The manifest Buddha uses eternal reality" |
| 10 | **In fundamental, using trace** | "The eternal Buddha uses manifestation" |

## The Unique Power

Master Zhiyi is emphatic:

> "This sūtra's **opening expedient, revealing real**—Four Siddhāntas' great function is **most heroic and fierce**."

> "The Fundamental's ten uses—**no other sūtra has even one**, let alone ten!"

No other sūtra:
- **Gives the Two Vehicles Buddha's knowledge-and-vision**
- **Reveals the Buddha's eternal lifespan**
- **Converts "burnt seeds" (arhats) into future Buddhas**
- **Shows enemies (Devadatta) as bodhisattvas**

## Practice Prompt

**This week, work with the twenty uses:**

### Days 1-3: Which "Use" Are You In?
Look at the ten Trace uses. Where are you in relation to the three vehicles? Still attached (need "breaking")? Ready to see them as one ("opening")?

### Days 4-5: Trace and Fundamental
Do you still think of the Buddha as someone who became enlightened under a tree? Or have you glimpsed the eternal Buddha?

### Days 6-7: Breaking Doubt, Generating Faith
What doubts about the Dharma remain for you? What would "faith" (信) mean in this context—not belief, but **trustful confidence** in your own Buddha-nature?
