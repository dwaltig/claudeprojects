# The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra (妙法蓮華經玄義)
## Fascicle 8: What Is a "Sūtra"? What Is the Sūtra's "Body"?

**Practitioner Translation by The Practitioner**

> *"Only Buddha with Buddha can fully fathom the Reality-Mark of all dharmas."*

## The Word "Sūtra" — Translatable or Not?

The Chinese word 經 ("jīng") translates the Sanskrit *sūtra*. But can it really be translated?

Master Zhiyi surveys the debate:

### View 1: Cannot Be Translated

The Sanskrit word contains too many meanings. Chinese is too shallow to capture them all.

**Five Meanings That Don't Translate:**

| Meaning | What It Means |
|---------|---------------|
| **Dharma-Source** | Where all teaching, practice, and principle come from |
| **Subtle Development** | Understanding grows gradually, from faint to clear |
| **Gushing Spring** | Inexhaustible flow of meaning |
| **Plumb-Line** | Standard that cuts crooked views |
| **Flower Garland** | Threads teachings together so they don't scatter |

### View 2: Can Be Translated

Just translate it as "sūtra" or "scripture" and explain the depth.

**Five Meanings That Can Translate:**

| Translation | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| **Scripture (經)** | "Passing through"—all passes through the sage's mind |
| **Contract (契)** | Fits beings, events, and principle |
| **Dharma-Source** | Source of teaching |
| **Thread (線)** | Sews teachings together |
| **Good Teaching** | Teaching of good words/actions/principles |

### Master Zhiyi's Synthesis

Both are right! The word 經 contains **fifteen meanings**:

> Each of the five meanings splits into three aspects (teaching, practice, principle), so 5 × 3 = 15 per set.

The single character 經 contains all of them.

## What Is the Sūtra's "Body"? (體)

This is the crucial question: **What is the sūtra actually about?**

### Previous Wrong Answers

| Interpretation | Why Wrong |
|----------------|-----------|
| "One Vehicle" | Too vague—which one vehicle? |
| "True Truth" | Too general—small and great vehicles both have true truth |
| "One-Vehicle Cause and Fruit" | Still just events, not the principle |

### The Correct Answer: Reality-Mark (實相)

> "**Directly revealing substance: it is the One Reality-Mark Seal.**"

Among the Three Tracks, take **True Nature**.  
Among the Ten Dharma-Realms, take **Buddha Realm**.  
Among Buddha-realm's Ten Suchnesses, take **Such-Body**.

The *Lotus Sūtra*'s body is **Reality-Mark**—the ultimate truth of all dharmas.

## Three Similes for True and False

### 1. Three Beasts Crossing a River

A **rabbit**, **horse**, and **elephant** all cross the same river.

- Rabbit floats on the surface—doesn't reach bottom
- Horse goes deeper—still doesn't reach bottom
- **Elephant** goes all the way down and touches the riverbed

The water = emptiness (all three experience it)  
The bottom = non-emptiness (only the elephant—Perfect bodhisattva—reaches it)

---

### 2. Crystal vs. Wish-Fulfilling Jewel

Both look similar. But:

| Crystal | Wish-Fulfilling Jewel |
|---------|----------------------|
| Only empty | Both empty AND rains treasures |
| Mere emptiness | Emptiness with inexhaustible function |

Two Vehicles = crystal  
Perfect Teaching = wish-fulfilling jewel

---

### 3. Gold in Stone

Different people find gold-bearing rock:

| Person | What They Do |
|--------|--------------|
| **Fool** | Calls it "just stone," throws it away |
| **Merchant** | Melts out gold, keeps it |
| **Goldsmith** | Makes it into jewelry |
| **Alchemist** | Refines it into **golden elixir**, flies to heaven |

- Fool = ordinary beings (don't know their Buddha-nature)
- Merchant = Two Vehicles (get emptiness but stop there)
- Goldsmith = Distinct bodhisattvas (use skillful means)
- **Alchemist = Perfect practitioners** (transform gold into ultimate medicine)

> "**Gold-elixir Reality-Mark is the sūtra's substance.**"

---

## Why Reality-Mark Needs a Seal

Just as worldly documents need a seal to be authentic, Buddhist teachings need the **Reality-Mark Seal**:

> "Great Vehicle sūtras have **one dharma-seal**: Reality-Mark. This is called a definitive sūtra that can attain the Great Path. If it lacks the Reality-Mark seal, it is spoken by Māra."

Śāriputra says: "The World-Honored One teaches the real path; **Pāpīyān (Māra) has no such thing**."

## Practice Prompt

**This week, work with "what is the body?":**

### Days 1-2: Surface or Depth?
When you read or practice, are you like the rabbit (floating on the surface) or the elephant (going to the bottom)?

### Days 3-4: Crystal or Wish-Fulfilling?
Is your understanding of emptiness "mere emptiness" (crystal) or emptiness-that-functions (wish-fulfilling jewel)?

### Days 5-7: Gold in Stone
What's your relationship to Buddha-nature? Are you throwing away the stone? Keeping the gold? Making jewelry? Or **refining the elixir**?

**The key insight**: The "body" of the *Lotus Sūtra* isn't a doctrine—it's Reality-Mark itself, the ultimate truth that stamps all teachings as authentic.
