# The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra (妙法蓮華經玄義)
## Fascicle 3, Part 2: Practice Subtlety (行妙) — Wisdom-Eyes and Practice-Feet

**Practitioner Translation by The Practitioner**

---

> *"You can see the destination perfectly, but if you don't walk, you'll never get there. You can walk forever, but if you can't see, you'll never arrive. Eyes and feet—you need both."*

---

## The Core Teaching

Master Zhiyi opens with one of his most famous images:

> "Practice means advancing forward—**without wisdom, there is no progress**. Wisdom-understanding guides practice—**without realm, practice is not correct**. **Wisdom is the eyes; practice is the feet—together they arrive at the clear cool pond.**"

The **clear cool pond** is liberation—refreshing relief from the burning of afflictions.

You need:
- **Eyes** (wisdom) to see where you're going
- **Feet** (practice) to get there
- **Territory** (realm) that's actually worth seeing

---

## One Practice, All Practices

But here's where it gets subtle:

> "Such mutual dependence is not yet subtle practice. **Subtle practice means: one practice is all practices.**"

In ordinary practice, you do one thing, then another, then another—accumulating.

In **subtle practice**, any one thing you do fully is the complete path. Not because the other practices don't matter, but because when you truly do one thing, you're actually doing everything.

The Lotus Sutra says:
- "**Complete**" (具) — meaning broad
- "**Deep**" (深) — meaning high  
- "**Exhaustive**" (盡) — meaning ultimate

Complete + Deep + Exhaustive = the practice is **everywhere, profound, and total**.

---

## The Three Dots

Master Zhiyi introduces a key symbol:

> "Present practice is what is practiced; practicing as taught, it also contains three, called the **three dots of the *i* character** (伊字三點)."

The Sanskrit vowel *i* (इ) has three elements arranged in a triangle—not stacked vertically, not spread horizontally. They interpenetrate.

That's the relationship between:
- **Realm** (what you see)
- **Wisdom** (how you see)
- **Practice** (what you do)

None is first. None is separate. Each contains the other two.

---

## Increasing-Number Practices

Master Zhiyi shows how each teaching uses "increasing numbers" to describe practice:

### Tripiṭaka: One Practice

The Buddha told the monks:

> "Cultivate **one practice**—I guarantee you the four fruits—namely, **the mind not being heedless**."

Just that. Guard the mind, don't be careless. If you can do that thoroughly, you've got the path.

---

### Tripiṭaka: Two Practices

> "Forest-dwelling monks should cultivate **two dharmas**: cultivating **cessation** and cultivating **insight**."

- **Cessation** (*śamatha*): Resting, calming, stopping evil
- **Insight** (*vipaśyanā*): Seeing, knowing, understanding suffering

Even the Tathāgata cultivated this way.

---

### Tripiṭaka: Three Practices

> "**Discipline, concentration, wisdom**—these three are the ladder out of the world."

The famous verse:

> "**All evils not to be done; all goods to be practiced; self-purify one's mind—this is the teaching of all Buddhas.**"

- **All evils** = what discipline prevents
- **All goods** = what practice cultivates
- **Self-purify** = what wisdom accomplishes

> "Buddha-dharma is a vast ocean; **these three encompass it all**."

---

### Common Teaching: One-Mark

> "Though knowing all dharmas as one-mark, [the bodhisattva] can also know all dharmas' various marks; though knowing various marks, can also know one-mark."

This is the **one-mark no-mark** teaching. Everything is the same (empty); everything is different (functioning). Hold both.

---

### Distinct Teaching: 110 Teachers

Like Sudhana in the *Gaṇḍavyūha*: visiting 110 good teachers, each teaching one dharma.

The key?

> "Each and every practice **breaks ignorance**, entering deep realms."

Not surface changes—deep transformation.

---

### Perfect Teaching: One-Practice Samādhi

> "Bodhisattvas cultivating the **One-Practice Samādhi**: in a quiet room, sitting cross-legged, **binding conditions to the Dharma-realm, one-thought being the Dharma-realm**, all ignorance and confusion eternally quiescent like space."

This is the Perfect approach:

> "**This one practice is precisely the unobstructed person of all**, one path exiting birth-and-death. Among all dharmas, entering through equal contemplation—the mind of liberating wisdom silent and still, within the three realms without peer."

**One practice encompassing all practices.**

---

## Coarse and Subtle

| Teaching | Judgment | Why |
|----------|----------|-----|
| **Tripiṭaka** | Coarse | Rests at Conjured City, only exits suffering |
| **Common** | Coarse | Skillful but still ash-extinction |
| **Distinct** | Coarse | Far-reaching but practices separated, not fused |
| **Perfect** | Subtle | Practice fused, wisdom complete |

---

## Opening: All Become Subtle

Here's the Lotus Sutra's gift:

> "**Lowering the head or raising the hand, piling earth or playing with sand—all become the Buddha Path.** Though teaching various dharmas, actually it is for the One Vehicle. All practices are subtle; there is no coarse to contrast—the contrast is severed."

This is extraordinary. A child playing in the sand is practicing the Buddha Way. An old woman bowing her head is accomplishing the path.

**Nothing is excluded.**

---

## The Five Special Practices

From the *Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra*:

| Practice | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| **Sacred Practice** (聖行) | Discipline, concentration, wisdom |
| **Pure Practice** (梵行) | Practice of purity |
| **Heavenly Practice** (天行) | Practice transcending ordinary |
| **Infant Practice** (嬰兒行) | Practice of innocence, no scheming |
| **Sick Practice** (病行) | Practice of compassion for suffering |

---

## The Ten Kinds of Discipline

Master Zhiyi enumerates ten levels of keeping precepts:

| # | Type | Meaning |
|---|------|---------|
| 1 | Not-broken | Root precepts intact |
| 2 | Not-deficient | No missing aspects |
| 3 | Not-holed | No subtle violations |
| 4 | Not-mixed | Not polluted by wrong intentions |
| 5 | Following-the-Path | Precepts as path |
| 6 | Non-Attachment | Precepts without grasping |
| 7 | Praised-by-the-Wise | Recognized by sages |
| 8 | Self-Mastery | Free and unhindered |
| 9 | Following-Concentration | Arising from samādhi |
| 10 | Fully-Complete | All pāramitās contained |

---

## Opening Coarse Precepts

The final teaching:

> "The three refuges, five precepts, ten goods, 250 bhikṣu rules—**all are Mahāyāna**. How could coarse precepts be separated from subtle precepts!"

The most basic practices—taking refuge, keeping the five precepts—are already the Great Vehicle.

> "Precepts being precisely subtle, people are also thus. **'You are truly my children'**—this is that meaning."

The Lotus Sutra's famous declaration to the three-vehicle students: you're not outsiders, not step-children, not inferior. You are my true children. Always were.

## Practice Prompt

**This week, work with "eyes and feet":**

### Days 1-2: Inventory Your Practices
List what you actually do:
- Formal sitting?
- Precepts you keep?
- Study?
- Service?

Be honest about what you actually practice, not what you think you should.

### Days 3-4: The One Practice
Pick one practice you do. Ask: if I did this completely, would it contain everything else?

Try it. For one day, make that practice your total focus. See if meditation contains ethics. See if ethics contains wisdom. See if service contains insight.

### Days 5-7: Opening the Coarse
What's a "coarse" practice you do—something ordinary, not seemingly spiritual?
- Morning coffee ritual?
- Walking the dog?
- Making dinner?

Can you see it as the Buddha Path? Lowering the head and raising the hand—how is this already complete?
