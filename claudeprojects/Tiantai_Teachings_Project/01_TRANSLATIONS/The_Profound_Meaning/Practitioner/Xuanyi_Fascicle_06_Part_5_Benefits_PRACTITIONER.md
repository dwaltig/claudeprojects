# The Profound Meaning of the Lotus Sutra (妙法蓮華經玄義)
## Fascicle 6, Part 5: Benefits Subtlety (功德利益妙) — The Fruits of Practice

**Practitioner Translation by The Practitioner**

---

> *"What Buddhas do never passes emptily. Light released before liberates the former; light released after liberates the latter. None is wasted."*

---

## What This Section Covers

The **tenth and final Trace Subtlety** addresses **benefits** (利益)—the actual results of all this practice.

After nine subtleties of realm, wisdom, practice, position, three dharmas, resonance, supernatural powers, dharma-exposition, and retinue—what do beings actually **get**?

---

## Merit vs. Benefit

> "If distinguishing: **self-benefit is called merit (功德); benefiting others is called benefit (利益)**."

The Ten Trace Subtleties divide exactly this way:
- **First Five** (Realm through Three Dharmas): self-cultivation
- **Last Five** (Resonance through Benefits): transformation of others

Together: the complete Buddha-activity.

## Seven Benefits

Master Zhiyi identifies **seven levels** of benefit, correlated with the Medicinal Herbs parable:

| # | Benefit | Parable | Content |
|---|---------|---------|---------|
| 1 | **Fruit-reward** | Ground | Liberation from hell/ghost/animal realms |
| 2 | **Cause-development** | Small Herbs | Building good karma |
| 3 | **Analytical liberation** | Middle Herbs | Śrāvaka/arhat awakening |
| 4 | **Five powers** | Upper Herbs | Bodhisattva with five supernormal powers |
| 5 | **Body-dharma liberation** | Small Trees | Common Teaching liberation |
| 6 | **Six powers** | Great Trees | Full supernatural powers |
| 7 | **Middle-Way King Samādhi** | **The Real Thing** | Ultimate Buddha-awakening |

---

## How Even Hell-Beings Receive Benefit

Master Zhiyi doesn't abandon anyone:

> "Sinners there have **past-world good roots that can be triggered**. Sages go to respond—whether through light illuminating, rain extinguishing fire, or Devadatta explaining Dharma—**hot anguish revives, bodies become cool**."

Even in hell:
- Past good roots still exist
- Sages still respond
- Hidden and manifest benefit still arrive

---

## The Perfect-Person Benefit

At the highest level:

> "**One-thought Dharma-realm, connecting with Dharma-realm.** Whether passing through conditions or facing objects—**raising or lowering the foot, none is not the practice-site**."

For the Perfect practitioner:
- Every moment is practice
- Every condition is Dharma-realm
- Every action is awakening

Then:

> "**Suddenly awakening.** Whether seeming or true—obtaining hidden-and-manifest benefits. This is perfect use of twenty-five samādhis to break twenty-five existences, **revealing self-nature, obtaining ultimate real-matter benefit**."

---

## Ten Applications

Expanded to ten:

| Level | Who | Benefit |
|-------|-----|---------|
| **Fruit** | Hell/ghost/animal | Relief from suffering |
| **Cause** | Human/heavenly | Good karma established |
| **Śrāvaka** | Hearers | Arhatship |
| **Pratyekabuddha** | Solitary awakeners | Independent realization |
| **Six Pāramitās** | Tripiṭaka bodhisattvas | Perfection of giving etc. |
| **Common** | Common Teaching | Shared emptiness |
| **Distinct** | Distinct Teaching | Sequential bodhisattva path |
| **Perfect** | Perfect Teaching | Complete awakening |
| **Transformation** | Expedient Remainder | Post-arhat development |
| **Real-Reward** | Buddha-land | Ultimate fruition |

## Half the Wish-Fulfilling Jewel

Master Zhiyi concludes the Trace Subtleties with:

> "**These five [latter] sections clarify subtlety**—from cause to fruit, distinguishing self-practice subtlety. **Half the wish-fulfilling jewel is complete**."

The Ten Trace Subtleties are the **Trace Gate** (迹門)—dealing with the Buddha's manifest teaching.

The other half—the **Fundamental Gate** (本門)—deals with the Buddha's eternal nature (revealed in Chapter 16, "Lifespan of the Tathāgata").

## Practice Prompt

**This week, work with "nothing wasted":**

### Days 1-2: Past Good Roots
Consider: what good roots from past lives might be activating in your current practice? What "luck" might actually be ripening karma?

### Days 3-4: Every Foot-Step
Try practicing as if "raising or lowering the foot—none is not the practice-site." Can ordinary activities become awakening?

### Days 5-7: Nothing Wasted
"What Buddhas do never passes emptily." Apply this to your own practice: nothing is wasted. Every bow, every moment of attention, every effort—**none is wasted**.
