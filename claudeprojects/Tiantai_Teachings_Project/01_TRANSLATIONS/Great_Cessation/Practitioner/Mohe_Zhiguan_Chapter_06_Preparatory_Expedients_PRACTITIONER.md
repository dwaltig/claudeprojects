# Mohe Zhiguan - Chapter 6: The Prep Work (Cleaning House) - The Practitioner's Blues

## The Practitioner's Review
"Before you try to drive the car (Chapter 7: Correct Contemplation), you gotta check the tires, fill the tank, and make sure you aren't drunk.
Chapter 6 is the **Checklist**.
There are 25 things to check. If you skip these, you're gonna crash."

## 🎸 The Blues Interpretation

### 1. Cleaning House (The Five Conditions)
"You can't cook a gourmet meal in a dirty kitchen.
1.  **Keep it Clean (Precepts):** Stop doing the things that make you feel guilty. Guilt is noise. You need silence.
2.  **Fill the Fridge (Clothes/Food):** Don't be starving, don't be stuffed. Wear comfortable clothes. Don't let your body distract you.
3.  **Find a Quiet Spot (Place):** Shut the door. Turn off the phone. Find a corner where nobody needs you for an hour.
4.  **Hang up the Phone (Cease Duties):** Stop working. Stop networking. Stop checking emails. The world will spin without you for a while.
5.  **Find a Buddy (Good Friend):** You need someone to watch your back (provide food) and someone to watch your mind (a teacher). Don't go it alone."

### 2. Shutting the Windows (The Five Desires)
"Your senses are like open windows letting in the street noise. Shut them.
*   Don't look at pretty things.
*   Don't listen to music.
*   Don't chase smells or tastes.
*   **Realize:** It's just a dog chewing a dry bone. There's no juice in it."

### 3. Taking out the Trash (The Five Hindrances)
"Now look inside. There's trash on the floor.
1.  **Greed:** 'I want that.' (Throw it out).
2.  **Anger:** 'I hate that.' (Throw it out).
3.  **Sleep:** 'I'm tired.' (Wake up! Turn on the lights).
4.  **Worry/ restlessness:** 'What about yesterday?' (Forget it. Count your breath).
5.  **Doubt:** 'Is this working?' (Yes. Keep going)."

### 4. Tuning the Guitar (Adjusting the Five Matters)
"This is the most important part. You are the instrument. If the strings are too tight, they snap. Too loose, they don't play.
*   **Food/Sleep:** Tune them to the 'Middle.' Not too much, not too little.
*   **Body:** Sit straight. Like a stack of golden coins. Relax the shoulders. Tongue on the roof of the mouth.
*   **Breath (The Secret):** Listen to your breathing.
    *   If you hear it (**Wind**), it's too rough.
    *   If it jerks (**Gasp**), it's too tight.
    *   If it drags (**Qi**), it's too tired.
    *   You want **The Silk Thread (Xi)**. Silent. Smooth. Continuous. Like a thin line of smoke going straight up.
*   **Mind:**
    *   If you're sleepy (**Sinking**), look up (focus on your forehead).
    *   If you're crazy (**Floating**), look down (focus on your navel)."

### 5. Playing the Song (The Five Practices)
"Now you're ready to play.
1.  **Want it (Desire):** You gotta be hungry for the Truth.
2.  **Work it (Effort):** Don't stop.
3.  **Watch it (Mindfulness):** Don't forget what you're doing.
4.  **Know it (Wisdom):** Know the difference between a sour note and a sweet one.
5.  **One Mind:** Lock it in."

## 🧘 Practical Application: "The Pre-Flight Check"

Before every session, run the checklist:
1.  **Environment:** Phone off? Door closed?
2.  **Body:** Hungry? Full? (Adjust).
3.  **Posture:** Spine straight? Shoulders down?
4.  **Breath:** Is it Wind? Gasp? Or Silk? Wait until it becomes Silk.
5.  **Mind:** Am I sinking or floating? (Adjust focus).
6.  **Go.**

**Prompt for next session:** "The Prep is done. Now we start the Main Event. Chapter 7: Correct Contemplation. The Ten Objects and the Ten Modes."
