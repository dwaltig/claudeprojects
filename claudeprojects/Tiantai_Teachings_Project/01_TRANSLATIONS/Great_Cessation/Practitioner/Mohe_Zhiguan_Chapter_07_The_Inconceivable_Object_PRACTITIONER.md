# Mohe Zhiguan - Chapter 7: The Hologram (One Thought, 3000 Worlds) - The Practitioner's Blues

## The Practitioner's Review
"This is it. The Big Idea.
Master Zhiyi says that your mind right now—whether you're angry, bored, or thinking about lunch—is holding the entire universe. Not just a picture of it. The actual universe.
He calls it **'Three Thousand Realms in One Thought.'**"

## 🎸 The Blues Interpretation

### The Math (Don't Panic)
"It sounds complicated, but it's simple:
1.  **10 Vibes:** You got 10 basic vibes (Hell, Ghost, Animal, Human, Angry God, Heaven, Learner, Loner, Hero, Buddha).
2.  **Mutual Club:** Each vibe has the other 9 in its pocket. Even a Buddha has a 'Hell' pocket (so he can understand pain). Even a Hell-being has a 'Buddha' pocket (so he can wake up). That's 10 x 10 = **100**.
3.  **10 Features:** Each vibe has 10 features (Appearance, Nature, Cause, Effect, etc.). That's 100 x 10 = **1,000**.
4.  **3 Parts:** Each vibe happens in 3 places: Your Body, Your Mind, and Your Environment. That's 1,000 x 3 = **3,000**.

**The Point:** Every single thought you have is a 3,000-sided die. It rolls the whole cosmos."

### The Hologram
"You know how in a hologram, if you cut a piece off, the whole picture is still in the little piece?
Your mind is like that.
*   **The Hell Moment:** When you're furious, you aren't just 'mad.' You are physically, mentally, and environmentally in Hell. The walls are iron. The ground is hot.
*   **The Buddha Moment:** When you're compassionate, you aren't just 'nice.' You are in the Pure Land. The ground is gold.

**The Kicker:** You don't 'create' these worlds. They are *already there*. You just tune into them.
*   If you tune into Anger, the Hell world pops up.
*   If you tune into Wisdom, the Buddha world pops up.
*   But—and this is the deep part—**The Hell World contains the Buddha World.**
    *   Right there in your rage, the Buddha is waiting.
    *   Right there in your wisdom, the Demon is sleeping.

**Non-Dual:** It’s not 'Good vs. Evil.' It’s 'Everything is Everything.'
This is **The Inconceivable Object.**"

## 🧘 Practical Application: "Scanning the Hologram"

1.  **Catch a Thought:** Take whatever you are feeling right now (e.g., "I'm tired").
2.  **Scan it:**
    *   **Which World?** (Maybe 'Animal'—dullness? Or 'Human'—neutral?).
    *   **Where is the Buddha?** Look for the 'Buddha Pocket' in that tired thought. Is there a calmness in the tired? Is there a truth in it?
3.  **The Switch:** Realize you don't have to 'go' anywhere to find the Buddha. He's sitting right there in the middle of your tiredness.
4.  **Mantra:** "This boring thought is the 3,000 Worlds. I am holding the universe."

**Prompt for next session:** "We've seen the Universe. Now, what if you get stuck? We'll talk about 'Knowing Passage and Blockage' next."
