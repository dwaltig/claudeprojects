# Mohe Zhiguan - Chapter 1: The Grand Purpose (Part 2: The Workout) - The Practitioner's Blues

## The Practitioner's Review
"Okay, you've got the 'Great Mind' (Part 1). You know you're the Buddha. Now comes the hard part: You gotta prove it.

Master Zhiyi lays out the gym routine. And let me tell you, this ain't for the faint of heart. He's talking about 90-day marathons. But the jewel in the crown is the fourth one—the one you can do while you're driving, cooking, or arguing with your boss."

## 🎸 The Blues Interpretation

### The Four Workouts (Samadhis)

"Think of these as four different ways to tune your instrument.

**1. The Iron Seat (Constant Sitting)**
*   **The Drill:** You sit down. You don't get up for 90 days. No lying down. No walking around. Just you and the wall (or the Buddha).
*   **The Vibe:** This is 'One Act.' You pour all your energy into one posture. It's like holding a single high note until it shatters the glass.
*   **The Blues Translation:** You might not have 90 days. But try 90 minutes. Sit still. Don't move a muscle. Let the itch burn. Let the knee ache. Watch the 'I' that wants to move, and realize *that* 'I' is just a ghost.

**2. The Marathon (Constant Walking)**
*   **The Drill:** You walk. For 90 days. You don't stop. You chant 'Amitabha' every step.
*   **The Vibe:** This is 'Standing Buddha.' You walk until your legs fall off, until the only thing keeping you upright is the Name.
*   **The Blues Translation:** This is the 'Walking Blues.' Next time you're pacing the floor at 3 AM, or walking to work, lock into the rhythm. Step, Step, Name, Name. Don't let a single thought get between your foot and the floor.

**3. The Mix-Up (Half-Walk, Half-Sit)**
*   **The Drill:** You mix it up. 7 days of chanting, bowing, walking, sitting. Repentance rituals.
*   **The Vibe:** This is 'active cleaning.' You're scrubbing the floor of your soul with the Lotus Sutra.
*   **The Blues Translation:** This is your Sunday Morning service. You sing, you pray, you sit, you stand. You bring your body into it.

**4. The Freestyle (Neither-Walk-Nor-Sit)**
*   **The Drill:** This is the big one. 'Following Your Own Mind.' You meditate *while* you're living.
*   **The Vibe:** Jazz. Improvisation. There are no rules about posture, but the rule about *attention* is stricter than ever.
*   **The Technique: The Four-Step Shuffle (Sì Yùn)**
    When a feeling hits you (say, Anger), don't just get mad. Freeze frame it. Look at it in four beats:
    1.  **Not Yet:** Where was the anger 5 seconds ago? (It wasn't there).
    2.  **About To:** The moment you felt the heat rising. Where did that come from?
    3.  **Right Now:** You're mad. But *what* is mad? Is your stomach mad? Is your memory mad?
    4.  **Gone:** The anger fades. Where did it go? Did it hide in your pocket?

    **The Kicker:** If you look really close, you can't find the anger in *any* of those four spots. It’s like a phantom note. It sounds real, but you can't touch it.

**Applying it to the Mess:**
*   **When you're doing Good:** You give a dollar to a homeless guy. Don't pat yourself on the back. Apply the Four Steps. Who gave it? Who got it? It's all empty. That makes the giving pure.
*   **When you're doing Evil:** You yell at your kid. Stop. Apply the Four Steps. Don't beat yourself up (that's just more ego). Just see that the anger was empty. It was just a storm passing through the sky. The sky (You) is still clean."

## 🧘 Practical Application: "The Four-Step Shuffle"

1.  **Pick a Poison:** Choose one feeling that troubles you today (Anxiety, Lust, Anger, Boredom).
2.  **Wait for it:** Go about your day until it hits.
3.  **The Shuffle:**
    *   **Beat 1 (Not Yet):** "I was fine a minute ago."
    *   **Beat 2 (About To):** "I felt the tightening."
    *   **Beat 3 (Right Now):** "It's burning." (Stare at the burn. Does it have a shape?)
    *   **Beat 4 (Gone):** "It passed."
4.  **The Realization:** "If it comes and goes, it ain't Me."

**Prompt for next session:** "We’re heading to the finish line—Feeling the Fruit and Rending the Net. What's the 'Fruit' you're hoping for?"
