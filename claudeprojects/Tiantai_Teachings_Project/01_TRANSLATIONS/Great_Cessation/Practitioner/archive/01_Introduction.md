# Mohe Zhiguan - Fascicle 1: Introduction (Blues)

## 🧘 The Practitioner's Interpretation: "The Stream and the Source"

Stop and Look.
Clear as a bell, quiet as a deep freeze.
Folks around here never heard a sound like this before.

It was the Master—we called him the Wise Man—back in '94, high summer in Jingzhou. He sat down at Jade Spring Temple and let it rain. He let the mercy rain down on us for two whole seasons.

Man, he loved to preach. He could have gone on forever, spinning that Wheel of Truth. But he only got as far as "Looking at Your Own Wrong Views" before the wheel stopped turning. The music died out. The rest of the song... well, the rest was silence.

But you know how it is. You taste the water, you want to find the spring. You smell the flower, you start digging for the root.

They say, "I walk this road alone, no teacher holds my hand."
But the Good Book says, "Long ago, the Lamp-Lighter Buddha told me my name."
And the old scholars say, "Some are born knowing, and some have to sweat to learn."

This Dharma door is wide open, deep and strange.
Did it flash like lightning in a clear sky?
Or did it grow like the blues—deeper and darker than the soil it sprang from?

If you want to know where this soul comes from, you got to look at the family tree. You got to hear the *Story of the Treasury*. Then you'll know whose blood is running through these veins.

### Practitioner's Note:
Zhiyi didn't finish the book. He stopped at "Views." That means the rest is up to us. The text isn't a dead thing; it's a broken-off sentence. We are the punctuation. When he asks if this wisdom is "innate" or "learned," he's asking: *Is this jazz just something you feel, or did you learn your scales?* The answer, of course, is both.
