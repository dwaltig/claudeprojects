# Mohe Zhiguan - Fascicle 1: The Five Objectives of the Grand Purpose (Blues)

## 🧘 The Practitioner's Interpretation: "The Five Big Moves"

The Master said the "Grand Purpose" is huge—it covers everything from the first step to the last breath. It's so big you might miss it, so he broke it down into five big moves.

**1. Wake Up Big (Arousing the Great Mind)**
Most folks are sleepwalking, upside down and backwards. They don't even know they're asleep. The first move is to shake them awake. You look up to the Truth, and you reach down to help your neighbor. You decide to wake up for everybody's sake.

**2. Walk Big (Cultivating the Great Practice)**
It's not enough to just *want* to go home. If you stare at the road but don't move your feet, you'll never get there. You gotta walk. You gotta sweat. We call this "The Four Samadhis"—four ways to sit, walk, and stand until your mind stops jumping.

**3. Harvest Big (Feeling the Great Fruit)**
You don't do this for a reward, but the reward comes anyway. You don't ask for heaven, but heaven shows up. We talk about the "Marvelous Payoff" just to keep your heart glad when the road gets rough.

**4. Cut the Net (Rending the Great Net)**
The world is full of books and theories. They open your eyes, but they also trap you. You get stuck saying "This is right, that is wrong." You hear "snow" and think "cold," but you've never touched it. You hear "crane" and think "flying," but you've never seen it. This teaching cuts through all that tangled mess. It unties the knots and lets the bird out of the cage.

**5. Go Home Big (Returning to the Great Abode)**
Where does it all end? In the Great Place.
There's no start line and no finish line. There's no wall and no door. When you see the Real World (Dharma-realm), you see it's always been wide open. Clear, free, and easy. That's where we live.
