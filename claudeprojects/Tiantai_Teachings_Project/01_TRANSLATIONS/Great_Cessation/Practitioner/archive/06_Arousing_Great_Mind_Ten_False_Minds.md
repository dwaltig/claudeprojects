# Mohe Zhiguan - Fascicle 1: Arousing the Great Mind (Practitioner)

## 🧘 The Practitioner's Interpretation: "Checking Your Engine"

Before we start the car, we gotta check the engine.
"Bodhi" means the Way. "Citta" means the Mind—not the pumping heart or the physical brain, but the *Thinking Mind* that knows what's going on.

The Master says before we find the True Mind, we have to throw out the junk. He lists ten kinds of "False Minds." These are the engines that will drive you off a cliff. Check yourself: are you running on one of these?

1.  **The Hell Engine:** All you think about is hate, greed, and stupidity. You can't stop it, you can't pull it out. You're just burning fuel to go straight to the fire.
2.  **The Animal Engine:** You just want a pack. You want followers. You want to swallow people up like the ocean swallows rivers. That's the road of blood.
3.  **The Ghost Engine:** You want fame. You want people in the four corners of the world to sing your name. Inside, you're empty; outside, you pretend to be a saint. That's the road of knives.
4.  **The Asura (Titan) Engine:** You always have to win. You can't stand being second. You look down on people like a hawk. On the outside, you talk about "justice" and "fairness," but inside, it's just pride.
5.  **The Human Engine:** You just want to be comfortable. You want to keep this stinking body safe and this confused mind happy. It's not evil, but it's just... worldly.
6.  **The Heavenly Engine:** You want pure pleasure. You shut your eyes and ears to the world's mess so you can float in a bubble of bliss.
7.  **The Demon Engine:** You want power. You want it so that when you snap your fingers, everybody jumps. You want control.
8.  **The Smart-Aleck Engine:** You want to be the smartest guy in the room. You want to win every debate and have the whole world look at you and say, "Wow, he's brilliant."
9.  **The Zen Engine:** You want high-class meditation states. You think the world is too noisy, so you retreat into deep, heavy internal silence.
10. **The Escape Engine (Two Vehicles):** You see the whole cycle as a trap. You want out. You're hungry for purity, hungry for silence, hungry to just be *done* with it all.

**The Verdict:**
None of these are the Great Mind.
Some are evil, some are good, some are spiritual. But they are all *partial*. If you're running on these, you aren't ready for the Big Vehicle. You have to turn these engines off before you can start the real one.
