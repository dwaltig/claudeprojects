# Mohe Zhiguan - Fascicle 5: The Ten Objects of Contemplation (Practitioner)

## 🧘 The Practitioner's Interpretation: "The Ten Things You'll Bump Into"

When you sit down to meditate, what are you actually looking at? The Master gave us a checklist of ten things.

**1. The Usual Suspects (Body & Mind)**
This is #1 because it's always there. Your legs hurt (Body/Form), you feel annoyed (Feeling), you think about lunch (Mind). This is the "Constant Object." If nothing else is happening, you look at this.

**2. The Hot Mess (Defilements)**
As soon as you look at your mind, you stir up the mud. Greed, anger, stupidity. The "Three Poisons." Suddenly you're mad at a guy you haven't seen in ten years. That's Object #2.

**3. The Breakdown (Sickness)**
All that mental wrestling can make you physically sick. Your chest gets tight, your head aches. Sometimes the body just breaks. That's Object #3.

**4. The Ghost of the Past (Karma)**
Sickness reminds you of what you did. You start remembering past mistakes, or you see visions of past lives. Your old debts come calling. That's Object #4.

**5. The Spook (Demons)**
Now you're getting somewhere, and the "neighbors" don't like it. Scary faces, beautiful visions, sudden fears—anything to make you stop. That's the Demon.

**6. The Zone (Dhyana)**
You beat the demon, and suddenly—peace. Bliss. You feel light as a feather. You're in "The Zone." Watch out—this is a trap too. If you get stuck enjoying the high, that's Object #6.

**7. The Big Idea (Views)**
In the Zone, you get a "brilliant" idea. "I understand the universe! Everything is blue!" You start writing a philosophy book in your head. That's a View.

**8. The Ego Trip (Arrogance)**
"I'm a genius. I'm a saint. Nobody meditates like me." You think you've made it when you haven't. That's the Ego Trip.

**9. The Cop-Out (Two Vehicles)**
"This is too hard. I just want peace. I'm checking out. Screw saving the world, I'm going to Nirvana alone." That's the Hinayana trap.

**10. The Do-Gooder Trap (Bodhisattva)**
"I'm going to save everyone right now!" You run out to save the world before you can even swim. You get attached to the *idea* of being a hero. That's the final trap.

**Practitioner's Note:**
Start with #1. If #2 through #10 show up, deal with them. If they don't, keep watching #1. Don't go looking for trouble.
