# Mohe Zhiguan - Fascicle 1: The Four Vows and Six Identities (Practitioner)

## 🧘 The Practitioner's Interpretation: "The Vow and the Roadmap"

After we see the Truth, we have to make a promise (The Vow) and then look at the map (The Six Identities) so we don't get lost or cocky.

**The Four Vows (The Big Promise)**
Understanding the Truth isn't enough. We've been spinning in circles because we didn't get it. Now we see the house is burning. We can't just sit there playing games. We have to make the Big Move: "I promise to fix this mess for myself and everyone else."

**The Six Identities (The "You Are It" Map)**
People get confused.
*   Some say: "I'm just a dirtbag, I can never be a Buddha." (That's fear).
*   Some say: "I'm already a Buddha, I don't need to practice." (That's arrogance).

The Master laid out the Six Identities to cure both sicknesses. It says: **You are Buddha right now (so don't be afraid), but you have a long way to go (so don't be cocky).**

1.  **Identity in Principle (The Factory Setting):**
    Right here, right now, your mind *is* the Buddha-mind. It has the factory setting of perfection. Even if you're thinking about lunch, that thought has the structure of the Universe. You *are* It.

2.  **Identity in Name (Hearing the News):**
    You didn't know you were It until someone told you. Now you've heard the words. You understand the idea. "Oh, I'm a Buddha." That's great, but it's just words.

3.  **Identity in Practice (Walking the Talk):**
    Words are cheap. If you just talk about it, you're like a bug chewing on wood that accidentally spells a word. You have to sit down and do the work. Your actions have to match your mouth. This is where the rubber meets the road.

4.  **Identity in Resemblance (Getting Warm):**
    You've been practicing. It's starting to feel real. You aren't hitting the bullseye yet, but you're hitting the target. Your senses act clean; you don't get snagged on things easily. You *look* like a Buddha, but you're still practicing.

5.  **Identity in Partial Truth (The Real Deal Begins):**
    Boom. You hit the bullseye. You break through the fog of ignorance. You see the Buddha-nature directly. This is the First Abode. You are a "Partial Buddha." You're the real moon, even if you're just a crescent.

6.  **Identity in Ultimate (Full Moon):**
    The crescent grows until it's full. No more darkness. No more path. Just the full, bright, round perfection. That's the Fruit.

**Practitioner's Note:**
Most of us are somewhere between #2 and #3. We know the words, and we're trying to practice. Don't let anyone tell you you're #6 just because you read a book. And don't let anyone tell you you're trash, because your factory setting is #1.
