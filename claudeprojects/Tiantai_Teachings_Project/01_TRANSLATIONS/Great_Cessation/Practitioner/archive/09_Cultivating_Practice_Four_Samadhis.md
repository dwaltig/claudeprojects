# Mohe Zhiguan - Fascicle 2: The Four Samadhis (Practitioner)

## 🧘 The Practitioner's Interpretation: "Four Ways to Sweat"

You want to get somewhere? You gotta move. You can't just talk about the milk; you have to churn it to get the butter. The Master laid out four intense workouts. We call them **Samadhis**—that means "Getting Your Head Straight."

**1. The Sit-In (Constant Sitting)**
*   **The Drill:** You find a quiet room. You get one chair. You sit there for **90 days**. No lying down. No leaning against the wall. No sleeping like a corpse. You just sit, facing the Buddha.
*   **The Mindset:** You aren't just staring at the wall. You're staring at Reality. You realize that everything you see, hear, or think *is* the Buddha-Dharma. It's the "One Act." You lock in until the boundaries dissolve.

**2. The Marathon (Constant Walking)**
*   **The Drill:** This one is brutal. For **90 days**, you walk. You never sit down. You never sleep. You walk in circles, chanting "Amitābha, Amitābha."
*   **The Mindset:** You visualize the Buddha standing right in front of you. But here's the kicker: You know he didn't walk to you, and you didn't walk to him. It's all Mind. "My mind creates the Buddha." This is the "Buddha-Standing" practice.

**3. The Mix (Part-Walk Part-Sit)**
*   **The Drill:** This is for the *Lotus Sutra* or the *Vaipulya* repentance. You walk for a while (maybe 120 laps), chanting the sutra. Then you sit and think about it. Rinse and repeat.
*   **The Vibe:** It involves a lot of confession. You scrub the altar, you scrub your soul. You picture Samantabhadra on his six-tusked elephant coming to check your work.

**4. The Jazz (Neither-Walk Nor-Sit)**
*   **The Drill:** This is the "Freestyle" or "Following Your Own Mind." You don't have a set schedule of sitting or walking. You do it wherever you are.
*   **The Practice:** You catch yourself in the act of living. Walking down the street? Watch your mind. Eating lunch? Watch your mind. Getting mad at your neighbor? Watch that anger. Where did it come from? Where is it going?
*   **The Goal:** To realize that even your trashiest thoughts are part of the Middle Way. This is the hardest one because there are no rules to hold you up. It's just you and your mind, 24/7.

**Practitioner's Note:**
Don't kid yourself. These aren't "relaxation techniques." These are spiritual boot camps. If you pick the 90-day walking pratyutpanna, you better have a "Good Friend" (teacher) to catch you when you fall. But if you can handle the heat, this is how you forge the steel.
