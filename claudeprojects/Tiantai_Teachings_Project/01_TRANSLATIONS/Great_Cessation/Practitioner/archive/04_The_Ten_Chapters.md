# Mohe Zhiguan - Fascicle 1: The Ten Chapters (Blues)

## 🧘 The Practitioner's Interpretation: "The Ten-Stop Map"

The Master laid out the whole journey in ten stops. It’s a perfect number—not a note missing, not a word extra. It starts with the mountain peak in view and ends with you standing right on top of it.

Here’s the setlist:

1.  **The Big Idea (Grand Purpose):** Why are we doing this? Because we’ve been lost in the dark for a long time, not realizing that the darkness itself is just light we haven't recognized yet.
2.  **Naming the Tune (Explaining the Name):** Once you see the light, you stop running around. That’s **Stopping**. Once you're clear and clean, that’s **Looking**.
3.  **The Real Thing (Substance):** Now you’ve got the actual feeling of it.
4.  **Everything In (Inclusion):** That feeling holds every sound and every story in the world.
5.  **Straight or Crooked (Biased/Perfect):** You learn to tell the difference between a temporary fix and the whole truth.
6.  **Getting Ready (Expedients):** You get your tools in order based on that big truth.
7.  **Playing it Right (Correct Contemplation):** You step onto the cushion and do the work.
8.  **The Payoff (Retributive Effects):** The work pays off in ways you can't even imagine.
9.  **Passing it On (Arising of Teachings):** Once you’ve got the music in you, you start teaching others how to sing.
10. **Going Home (Ultimate Goal):** Everybody finds peace together in the Great Silence.

**How the Road Opens Up:**
Even though the Truth is always quiet and never really "starts" or "stops," we talk about it in order. One door opens the next. 

We start with the **Big Idea** because we've been blind. We call it **Stopping and Looking** because once you stop being blind, you stop tripping. Once you've got the name, you've got the **Substance**. Once you've got the substance, you see how it **Includes** everything. Then you sort the **Perfect** from the biased. That leads to **Practice**, which leads to **Vision**, which brings the **Reward**. Then you **Teach**, and finally, we all **Go Home**.

That's the map. Ten stops from the mud to the stars.
