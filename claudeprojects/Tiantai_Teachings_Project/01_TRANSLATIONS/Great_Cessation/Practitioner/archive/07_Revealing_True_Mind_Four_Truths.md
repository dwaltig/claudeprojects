# Mohe Zhiguan - Fascicle 1: Revealing the True Mind (Practitioner)

## 🧘 The Practitioner's Interpretation: "Four Ways to See the Truth"

Once you've cleared out the junk engines, you need to know what "Truth" actually looks like. The Master says there isn't just one way to see the Four Noble Truths. There are four levels, like four different lenses.

**1. The Changing Truth (Born and Perishing)**
This is the standard view. Everything is changing.
*   Suffering is real and it hurts.
*   The Cause is real and it pushes you.
*   The Path is a cure you have to take.
*   Extinction (Nirvana) is wiping out the fire.
It works, but it's all about change. You're trying to fix a broken world.

**2. The Empty Truth (Unborn)**
This is the next level deep. You look at the suffering and realize... it's empty.
*   Suffering can't push you because there's no "you" to push.
*   Causes can't combine because they're empty shadows.
*   The Path isn't a cure, because there was never really a sickness.
*   Nirvana isn't "wiping out" anything, because nothing was ever really "born."
It's chill. It's quiet. It's the "Unborn."

**3. The Infinite Truth (Immeasurable)**
Now you stop looking at just yourself and look at the whole universe.
*   Suffering isn't just "pain"—it's a million different kinds of hells, ghosts, humans, and gods.
*   The Cause isn't just "greed"—it's infinite threads of karma.
*   The Path isn't just "meditation"—it's infinite ways to help infinite beings.
*   The Doctors (Bodhisattvas) need to know every single disease and every single medicine.
This is the big job. It's endless.

**4. The Natural Truth (No-Function)**
This is the ultimate.
*   You don't "fix" the world (Changing).
*   You don't "empty" the world (Empty).
*   You don't "count" the world (Infinite).
*   You see that the world *is* the Truth.
Suffering *is* Bodhi. Samsara *is* Nirvana. There's no "function," no effort to change anything into anything else. It's just Real. It's inconceivable.

**The Map of the Lands:**
*   Down here in our messy world (Co-dwelling), people teach all four views depending on what you need.
*   In the pure lands of the Saints (Expedient), they don't teach the first one anymore.
*   In the Bodhisattva lands (Real Retribution), they only deal with the Infinite and the Natural.
*   In the Buddha's home (Eternal Quiescence), there is only one Truth: The Natural one. No-Function. Just Being.
