# Mohe Zhiguan - Chapter 7: The Emergency Manual (Secondary Objects) - The Practitioner's Blues

## The Practitioner's Review
"So you know how to meditate when things are normal (Object 1).
But what happens when the wheels fall off?
What if you get sick? What if you get terrified? What if you get too high on bliss?
This is the **Emergency Manual** for the other 9 scenarios."

## 🎸 The Blues Interpretation

### 2. When You're Mad as Hell (Defilements)
"Don't fight the anger. Don't push it down.
**Look at it.**
See the fire. That fire is energy. If you clean the soot off, that fire is Wisdom.
**Mantra:** 'This anger is the Fuel.'"

### 3. When You're Sick (Sickness)
"Pain is a great teacher. It focuses the mind like nothing else.
*   **The Check:** Is it physical? (Go to a doctor).
*   **The View:** Who is hurting? Is the 'Self' hurting? Or is it just the body?
*   **The Breath:** Use the 'Six Breaths' to blow the pain out."

### 4. When the Ghosts Come Out (Karma)
"Sometimes old memories or weird visions pop up.
*   **The Move:** Don't watch the movie. Look at the screen.
*   **Realize:** It's just a playback. It can't hurt you unless you believe it."

### 5. When the Devil Knocks (Demons)
"Sometimes it gets scary. Or sometimes it gets *too* good (a voice says you're the Messiah).
*   **The Move:** Don't open the door. Don't fight them. Just sit there.
*   **The View:** 'You are just a part of my mind. Sit down and be quiet.'"

### 6. When You Get High (Dhyana)
"Meditation can feel better than drugs. You float. You see lights.
*   **The Danger:** You get addicted to the high. You stop working.
*   **The Move:** Enjoy the view, but keep driving. You aren't home yet."

### 7. When You Think You Know It All (Views)
"You get a great idea. You write a book. You tell everyone they're wrong.
*   **The Move:** Smash the idea (Mode 4).
*   **The Truth:** If you can think it, it ain't the Truth."

## 🧘 Practical Application: "The Pivot"

"Whatever happens—Good, Bad, Sick, or Scary—do the **Pivot**:
1.  **Acknowledge it:** 'Hello Anger.' 'Hello Pain.'
2.  **Apply the 3000 Worlds:** 'You are just one part of the Hologram.'
3.  **Return to Center:** 'I am the Space that holds you.'

**End of Volume I.**
You have the Map (Grand Purpose).
You have the Tools (Stop/Look).
You have the Prep (25 Expedients).
You have the Method (10 Vehicles).
You have the Target (The Mind).

Now... **Go Sit.**"
