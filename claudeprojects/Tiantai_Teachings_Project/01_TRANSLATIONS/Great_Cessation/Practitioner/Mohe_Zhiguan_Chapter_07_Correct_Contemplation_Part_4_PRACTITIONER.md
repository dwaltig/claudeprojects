# Mohe Zhiguan - Chapter 7: The Path to Completion (Finishing the Job) - The Practitioner's Blues

## The Practitioner's Review
"We're in the home stretch. We've smashed the bad habits. Now we need to make sure we don't get stuck in the 'Good' habits.
Master Zhiyi gives us a GPS, a Toolbox, and a Warning Label."

## 🎸 The Blues Interpretation

### 5. The GPS (Passage and Blockage)
"You gotta check the traffic.
*   **Green Light (Passage):** You're moving. You aren't stuck on 'I'm great' or 'I'm terrible.' You're flowing.
*   **Red Light (Blockage):** You're stopped. Maybe you're stuck on a cool insight. Maybe you're stuck on a grudge.
*   **The Move:** If it's Red, Smash it (Mode 4). If it's Green, keep driving."

### 6. The Tool Belt (The 37 Factors)
"Sometimes you need a specific tool.
*   **Mindfulness:** The Flashlight.
*   **Energy:** The Battery.
*   **Joy:** The Music.
Don't just sit there; use the tools to tune your mind."

### 7. The First Aid Kit (Auxiliary Cure)
"Sometimes the regular tools don't work. You're sick. You need medicine.
*   **Greedy?** Give something away.
*   **Angry?** Be kind.
*   **Stupid?** Read a book.
Do the opposite of your problem."

### 8. The Map (Knowing Stages)
"Don't lie to yourself.
*   If you're a rookie, admit it.
*   If you're a pro, admit it.
*   **The Trap:** Thinking you're a General when you're peeling potatoes. That's 'Pride,' and it kills the vibe."

### 9. The Shield (Patience)
"People are gonna talk. Life is gonna hurt.
*   **The Shield:** Don't fight back. Just let it bounce off.
*   **The View:** It's just a dream. Why get mad at a dream character?"

### 10. The Final Trap (No Dharma Love)
"This is the one that gets the experts.
You get close to the end. You feel amazing. The light is shining. The peace is deep.
You think: **'I made it. This is Heaven.'**
**STOP.**
That's the trap. That's 'Dharma Love.' You fell in love with the feeling.
*   **The Move:** Let go of the peace. Let go of the light. Step off the cliff into the Real Unknown.
*   **The Result:** You fly."

## 🧘 Practical Application: "The Daily Check-In"

1.  **Traffic Report:** Am I flowing or stuck?
2.  **Tool Check:** Do I need more Energy? More Calm? (Pick a tool).
3.  **Rank Check:** Am I getting arrogant? (Humble down).
4.  **Love Check:** Am I clinging to a 'spiritual feeling'? (Let it go).

**Prompt for next session:** "We've finished the Ten Modes. We've finished the First Object. This completes Volume I of the translation. Time to wrap it up."
