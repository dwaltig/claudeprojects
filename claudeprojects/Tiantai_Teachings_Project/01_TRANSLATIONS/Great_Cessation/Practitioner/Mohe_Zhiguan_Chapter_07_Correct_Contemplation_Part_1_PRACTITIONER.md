# Mohe Zhiguan - Chapter 7: The Main Event (The Ten Vehicles) - The Practitioner's Blues

## The Practitioner's Review
"We're finally here. Chapter 7. The Main Event.
Master Zhiyi lays out the **Ten Battlegrounds** (Objects) and the **Ten Weapons** (Vehicles) you need to win.
You don't need all ten weapons at once. Ideally, you just need the first one. But if that jams, you've got backups."

## 🎸 The Blues Interpretation

### 1. The Ten Battlegrounds (Objects)
"Where do you fight the demon of ignorance?
1.  **The Daily Grind (Skandhas):** Your own body and mind. This is where the war is 24/7.
2.  **The Meltdown (Defilements):** When you're angry, greedy, or stupid.
3.  **The Sickbed (Sickness):** When you're ill.
4.  **The Ghost of the Past (Karma):** When old memories haunt you.
5.  **The Devil (Demons):** When things get weird and scary.
6.  **The Zone (Dhyana):** When you get too high on meditation bliss.
7.  **The Wrong Idea (Views):** When you think you're smarter than you are.
8.  **The Big Head (Pride):** When you think you're a Saint.
9.  **The Dropout (Two Vehicles):** When you just want to quit and be alone.
10. **The Hero Complex (Bodhisattva):** When you're too busy saving the world to save yourself.

**Start with #1.** The others will show up when they show up."

### 2. The Ten Weapons (Vehicles)

"How do you fight?
1.  **The Magic Bullet (Inconceivable Object):** Look at your mind. Right now. See that it contains *everything*—Heaven, Hell, Buddhas, Demons. If you see this clearly, the war is over. You won.
2.  **The Big Heart (Compassion):** If the Magic Bullet doesn't fire, open your heart. Vow to save everyone. That energy will push you through.
3.  **The Smooth Move (Skillful Stopping/Looking):** If you're stuck, switch it up. If you're anxious, Stop. If you're dull, Look.
4.  **The Sledgehammer (Breaking Dharmas):** Smash the obsession. Whatever you're stuck on (even the Dharma), break it.
5.  **The Compass (Passage/Blockage):** Know if you're moving forward or just spinning your tires.
6.  **The Gear (Path Assistants):** Use the 37 Factors. Tune your instrument.
7.  **The Antidote (Auxiliary Cure):** If you're scared, count your breath. If you're angry, use kindness. Specific meds for specific poisons.
8.  **The Map (Knowing Stages):** Don't think you're a General when you're a Private. Know your rank.
9.  **The Shield (Patience):** Take the hits. Don't run.
10. **The Trapdoor (No Dharma Love):** When you finally get some peace, don't fall in love with it. That's the last trap. Keep moving."

## 🧘 Practical Application: "Firing the Magic Bullet"

1.  **Sit down.**
2.  **Look at your mind.** (Whatever thought is there—boredom, itch, worry).
3.  **Ask:** "Is this thought just a thought? Or is it the Universe?"
4.  **The Insight:** Realize that this tiny, boring thought is connected to everything. It *is* the Void. It *is* the Buddha.
5.  **If that works:** Great. You're done.
6.  **If not:** Go to Weapon #2 (Compassion). Say: "I am doing this to save everyone."

**Prompt for next session:** "We've got the weapons. Now let's enter the First Battleground: The Inconceivable Object. How to see 3000 worlds in one thought."
