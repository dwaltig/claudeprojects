# General Introduction

**The Great Cessation and Contemplation** (*Mohe Zhiguan*) is widely regarded as the most comprehensive manual of Buddhist meditation ever composed in East Asia. Delivered in 594 CE by the Great Master **Zhiyi** (538–597) at Yuquan Temple, this text represents the culmination of the Tiantai school's practical philosophy.

The title itself, *Mohe Zhiguan*, reveals the vast scope of the work:
*   **Mohe** (Maha): "Great" or "Grand." This signifies that the practice is not limited to the Hinayana (Small Vehicle) or the shared Mahayana methods, but encompasses the Perfect and Sudden teaching of the Lotus Sutra.
*   **Zhi** (Shamatha): "Stopping" or "Cessation." This refers to the quieting of the mind and the cessation of delusional conceptualization.
*   **Guan** (Vipashyana): "Seeing" or "Contemplation." This refers to the active insight into the nature of reality—specifically, the Three Truths of Emptiness, Provisionality, and the Middle Way.

Unlike other manuals that focus solely on technique, the *Mohe Zhiguan* integrates doctrine and practice into a seamless whole. It argues that without "Stopping" (Zhi), "Seeing" (Guan) cannot be stabilized; and without "Seeing," "Stopping" remains a stagnant, lifeless calm. The two must be practiced like the two wings of a bird or the two wheels of a cart.

This volume presents the **Scholarly Edition** of the foundational chapters. It guides the practitioner from the awakening of the Bodhicitta ("The Grand Purpose"), through the various forms of practice ("The Four Samadhis"), and into the specific applications of insight ("The Ten Objects").

It is our hope that this translation serves not only as an academic resource but as a living guide for those who seek to traverse the path to the Great White Ox Cart.
