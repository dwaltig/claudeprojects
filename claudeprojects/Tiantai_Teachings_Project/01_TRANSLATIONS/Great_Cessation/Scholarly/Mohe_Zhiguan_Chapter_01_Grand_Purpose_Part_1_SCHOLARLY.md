> ○解釋者，釋十章也。初釋大意，囊括始終，冠戴初後，意緩難見。今撮為五，謂發大心、修大行、感大果、裂大網、歸大處。
>
> 云何發大心？眾生昏倒不自覺知，勸令醒悟，上求下化。
>
> 云何行大行？雖復發心，望路不動，永無達期，勸牢強精進，行四種三昧。
>
> 云何感大果？雖不求梵天，梵天自應，稱揚妙報，慰悅其心。
>
> 云何裂大網？種種經論開人眼目，而執此疑彼、是一非諸，聞雪謂冷乃至聞鶴謂動。今融通經論，解結出籠。
>
> 云何歸大處？法無始終，法無通塞。若知法界，法界無始終、無通塞，豁然大朗，無礙自在。
>
> ○就發心更為三：初、方言，次、簡非，後、顯是。「菩提」者，天竺音也，此方稱「道」。「質多」者，天竺音，此方言「心」，即慮知之心也；天竺又稱「污栗馱」，此方稱是草木之心也；又稱「矣栗馱」，此方是積聚精要者為心也。今簡非者，簡積聚、草木等心，專在慮知心也。道亦有通有別，今亦簡之，略為十。

> 若其心念念專貪瞋癡，攝之不還、拔之不出，日增月甚，起上品十惡如五扇提羅者，此發地獄心、行火途道。
> 若其心念念欲多眷屬，如海吞流、如火焚薪，起中品十惡如調達誘眾者，此發畜生心、行血途道。
> 若其心念念欲得名聞，四遠八方稱揚欽詠，內無實德，虛比賢聖，起下品十惡如摩犍提者，此發鬼心、行刀途道。
> 若其心念念常欲勝彼，不耐下人、輕他珍己，如鴟高飛下視，而外揚仁義禮智信，起下品善心、行阿脩羅道。
> 若其心念念欣世間樂，安其臭身、悅其癡心，此起中品善心、行於人道。
> 若其心念念知三惡苦多、人間苦樂相間、天上純樂，為天上樂關六根不出、六塵不入，此上品善心、行於天道。
> 若其心念念欲大威勢，身口意纔有所作，一切弭從，此發欲界主心、行魔羅道。
> 若其心念念欲得利智辯聰，高才勇哲，鑒達六合，十方顒顒，此發世智心、行尼犍道。
> 若其心念念五塵六欲，外樂蓋微，三禪樂如石泉，其樂內重，此發梵心、行色無色道。
> 若其心念念知善惡輪環，凡夫耽湎，賢聖所呵，破惡由淨慧，淨慧由淨禪，淨禪由淨戒，尚此三法如飢如渴，此發無漏心、行二乘道。

## 🏛️ The Architect's Translation

"**The Exegesis:** This section explains the ten chapters. First, we explain the **Grand Purpose** (*Dàyì*). It encompasses the beginning and the end, crowning both the initial [stage] and the final [realization]. The meaning is broad and difficult to perceive; now we summarize it into five [objectives]:

1.  **Arousing the Great Mind** (*Fā Dàxīn*)
2.  **Cultivating the Great Practice** (*Xiū Dàxíng*)
3.  **Feeling the Great Fruit** (*Gǎn Dàguǒ*)
4.  **Rending the Great Net** (*Liè Dàwǎng*)
5.  **Returning to the Great Abode** (*Guī Dàchù*)

**1. Arousing the Great Mind:**
Sentient beings are confused and inverted, unaware and unknowing. [We] encourage them to awaken, seeking [Bodhi] above and transforming [beings] below.

**2. Cultivating the Great Practice:**
Although one has aroused the mind, if one looks at the road but does not move, there will never be a time of arrival. [We] encourage firm and strong diligence in practicing the **Four Kinds of Samadhi**.

**3. Feeling the Great Fruit:**
Although one does not seek the Brahma [Heaven], the Brahma Heaven responds of itself. We praise the marvelous retribution to comfort and gladden the mind.

**4. Rending the Great Net:**
Various sutras and treatises open people's eyes, but they grasp this and doubt that, affirming one and denying the many. Hearing of 'snow,' they say it is cold; hearing of a 'crane,' they say it moves [mistaking the description for the reality]. Now, we fuse and penetrate the sutras and treatises, untying the knots and releasing [birds] from the cage.

**5. Returning to the Great Abode:**
The Dharma has no beginning and no end; the Dharma has no blockage and no passage. If one knows the Dharma-realm, the Dharma-realm has no beginning or end, no blockage or passage. It is expansive and greatly clear, unobstructed and self-existent (*Zìzài*)."

---

### Objective 1: Arousing the Great Mind (*Fā Dàxīn*)

**Arousing the Mind (Bodhicitta)** is further divided into three parts:
1.  **Dialect/Definition** (*Fāngyán*)
2.  **Rejecting the False** (*Jiǎnfēi*)
3.  **Revealing the True** (*Xiǎnshì*)

**1. Dialect:**
'Bodhi' (*Pútí*) is the sound of India (*Tiānzhú*); in this region, it is called the 'Way' (*Dào*).
'Citta' (*Zhìduō*) is the sound of India; in this region, it means 'Mind' (*Xīn*), specifically the mind of cognitive deliberation (*Lǜzhī*).
India also has the term *Hṛdaya* (*Wūlìtuó*), which refers to the 'heart' of grass and trees (physical core).
It also has the term *Hṛdaya* (*Yǐlìtuó*), which refers to the 'heart' as the accumulation of essential essence (physical organ).
Now, in **Rejecting the False**, we reject the physical/vegetative hearts and focus exclusively on the **Cognitive Mind** (*Lǜzhī Xīn*). The 'Way' also has general and specific meanings; now we reject [the specific false ways], summarizing them into ten.

**2. Rejecting the False (The Ten Minds):**

1.  **Hellish Mind:** If the mind, thought after thought, is exclusively devoted to greed, anger, and ignorance—unable to be restrained or pulled out, increasing daily and monthly—arising in the Upper Grade of the Ten Evils (like the five *Caṇḍālas*), this is arousing the **Hell Mind**, walking the Way of Fire.
2.  **Animal Mind:** If the mind, thought after thought, desires many followers—like the ocean swallowing streams or fire burning wood—arising in the Middle Grade of the Ten Evils (like Devadatta seducing the multitude), this is arousing the **Animal Mind**, walking the Way of Blood.
3.  **Ghostly Mind:** If the mind, thought after thought, desires fame and reputation, to be praised and sung in the four distances and eight directions, inwardly lacking real virtue but falsely comparing oneself to sages—arising in the Lower Grade of the Ten Evils (like Māgaṇḍika), this is arousing the **Ghost Mind**, walking the Way of Knives.
4.  **Asura Mind:** If the mind, thought after thought, constantly desires to surpass others, cannot endure being below anyone, belittling others and cherishing oneself—like a hawk flying high and looking down—while outwardly displaying benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and faith (the Five Virtues), arising in the Lower Grade of Goodness, this is walking the **Asura Way**.
5.  **Human Mind:** If the mind, thought after thought, delights in worldly happiness, securing this stinking body and pleasing this deluded mind, this is arising in the Middle Grade of Goodness, walking the **Human Way**.
6.  **Heavenly Mind:** If the mind, thought after thought, knows the suffering of the Three Evil Paths, sees the mixture of pain and pleasure among humans, and seeks the pure pleasure of Heaven—closing the six senses so the six dusts do not enter—this is the Upper Grade of Goodness, walking the **Heavenly Way**.
7.  **Mara Mind (Demon):** If the mind, thought after thought, desires great power and authority, so that whatever one does with body, mouth, or mind, all obey and submit, this is arousing the **Lord of Desire Mind**, walking the Way of Mara.
8.  **Nirgrantha Mind (Heretic):** If the mind, thought after thought, desires sharp wisdom and debating intelligence, to be talented and brilliant, penetrating the universe so the ten directions gaze up in awe, this is arousing the **Worldly Wisdom Mind**, walking the Way of Nirgranthas.
9.  **Brahma Mind (Form/Formless):** If the mind, thought after thought, sees the five dusts and six desires as gross external pleasures, and sees the pleasure of the Third Dhyana (like a spring in a rock) as heavy internal pleasure, this is arousing the **Brahma Mind**, walking the Way of Form and Formless Realms.
10. **Two Vehicle Mind:** If the mind, thought after thought, knows the cycle of good and evil, where commoners indulge and sages rebuke; knowing that breaking evil comes from Pure Wisdom, Pure Wisdom from Pure Dhyana, and Pure Dhyana from Pure Precepts; valuing these three laws like a hungry man values food and drink—this is arousing the **Outflow-free Mind**, walking the Way of the Two Vehicles.

**Conclusion of Rejection:**
Whether it is the Mind or the Way, the false ones are very many; we summarize them into ten. We reject them because they are not the True Bodhicitta."

## 🏛️ The Architect's Translation

"**3. Revealing the True Mind (*Xiǎnshì*):**
This section is further divided into three parts:
A.  **The Four Truths** (*Sì Dì*)
B.  **The Four Vows** (*Sì Hóng*)
C.  **The Six Identities** (*Liù Jí*)

**A. The Four Truths (Si Di):**
The names and characteristics of the Four Truths come from the *Holy Conduct Chapter* of the *Great Sutra* (Nirvana Sutra). They are:
1.  **Born and Perishing** (*Shēngmiè*): Suffering and Accumulation are worldly cause and effect; the Path and Extinction are out-of-worldly. All are changing and mutating. (Tripitaka Teaching).
2.  **Unborn and Imperishing** (*Wúshēngmiè*): Suffering has no oppression (Empty); Accumulation has no combination; Path has no duality; Extinction has no extinction. (Connecting Teaching).
3.  **Immeasurable** (*Wúliàng*): Suffering has immeasurable characteristics (Hell, hungry ghosts, etc.) which the Two Vehicles cannot know. The Bodhisattva understands this variety. (Separate Teaching).
4.  **No-Function** (*Wúzuò*): All are the Real Mark (*Shíxiàng*). There is no plurality. This is the **Perfect Teaching**.

**B. The Four Great Vows (Sìhóng Shìyuàn):**
The Four Truths clarify 'Understanding' (*Jiě*); the Four Vows clarify 'Resolution' (*Yuàn*).
The Sutra says: 'Because I and you did not see the Four Truths, we have revolved for a long time.' The Burning House is like this; how can one indulge in pleasure? Therefore, out of compassion, one gives rise to the Four Great Vows to pull out suffering and give happiness.

**C. The Six Identities (Liùjí):**
Question: Is the 'True Mind' the initial mind or the later mind?
Answer: As the *Treatise* says about the charring of the wick: it is not the beginning yet not separated from the beginning.
*   If one lacks faith, they fall into Self-Abasement.
*   If one lacks wisdom, they fall into Overweening Pride (*Zēngshàngmàn*).
Therefore, one must know the **Six Identities**:

1.  **Identity in Principle (*Lǐ Jí*):** One thought-moment is the Tathāgata-garbha. 'Thus' is Empty; 'Store' is Provisional; 'Principle' is Middle.
2.  **Identity in Name (*Míngzì Jí*):** Hearing the names and understanding the meaning.
3.  **Identity in Contemplation/Practice (*Guānxíng Jí*):** Actions match words; contemplation is clear.
4.  **Identity in Resemblance (*Xiàngsì Jí*):** Six Sense-Organs Purification.
5.  **Identity in Partial Truth (*Fēnzhēn Jí*):** Breaking ignorance, seeing Buddha-nature. (First Abode to Equal Enlightenment).
6.  **Identity in Ultimate (*Jiùjìng Jí*):** Marvelous Enlightenment. The Fruit of Bodhi."

## 📜 Doctrinal Analysis

1.  **The Ten Minds:** This classification allows the practitioner to self-diagnose. It moves from the "Three Evil Paths" (Hell/Ghost/Animal) to the "Three Good Paths" (Human/Asura/Heaven), then to the "Heretical Paths" (Mara/Nirgrantha), and finally to the "Hinayana Paths" (Two Vehicles). All are rejected as *not* the "Great Mind" (Mahayana Bodhicitta).
2.  **Five Caṇḍālas (五扇提羅):** *Caṇḍāla* refers to an outcast or butcher class in ancient India, often used metaphorically for those who commit the Five Grave Offenses (killing father, mother, Arhat, shedding Buddha's blood, causing schism). Here it signifies the most depraved state of mind (Hell).
3.  **The Four Truths:** Master Zhiyi aligns the Four Truths with his "Four Teachings" (Tripitaka, Connecting, Separate, Perfect). This is a hallmark of Tiantai hermeneutics—the same doctrine (Four Truths) has four levels of depth.
4.  **The Six Identities:** This is one of the most critical Tiantai doctrines. It solves the tension between "Original Enlightenment" (we are already Buddhas in principle) and "Acquired Enlightenment" (we must practice to realize it). It prevents both laziness ("I'm already Buddha, no need to sit") and discouragement ("Buddhahood is too far away").
