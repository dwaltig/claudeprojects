## 🏛️ The Architect's Translation

"**3. Feeling the Great Fruit (*Gǎn Dàguǒ*):**
To clarify the pure Great Retribution of the Bodhisattva, we expound this Cessation and Contemplation.
*   If one's practice goes against the Middle Way, one has the retribution of the Two Extremes (Samsara or Hinayana Nirvana).
*   If one's practice accords with the Middle Way, one has the supreme and marvelous retribution.
Even if one has not yet exited the Segmented Birth and Death (*Fēnduàn*), the 'Flower Retribution' (Karmic reward in this life/heaven) obtained is already different from the Seven Expedients. How much more so the True Retribution? The 'Fragrant City with Seven Walls' and the 'Painted Bridges' are its characteristics. This meaning will be broadly distinguished in the **Eighth Layer** (Chapter 8: Retributive Effects).

**4. Rending the Great Net (*Liè Dàwǎng*):**
To penetrate and rend the 'Great Net' of various sutras and treatises, we expound this Cessation and Contemplation.
If a person skillfully uses Cessation and Contemplation to observe the mind, then their inner wisdom becomes clear and they penetrate the teachings of both the Gradual and the Sudden. It is like breaking a speck of dust to reveal a Great Thousand Worlds of sutra rolls; the Buddha-Dharma as numerous as the sands of the Ganges is understood within a single mind.
*   **Self-Benefit:** Inner wisdom becomes clear.
*   **Benefit for Others:** When desiring to benefit sentient beings externally, one establishes teachings according to their capacity (*jī*).
    *   Sometimes acting as a Dharma King to speak Sudden or Gradual teachings.
    *   Sometimes appearing as a Bodhisattva, Śrāvaka, god, demon, human, or ghost—manifesting forms from the Ten Dharma-realms to initiate dialogue.
    *   Sometimes asking the Buddha, or being asked by the Buddha.
This meaning will be broadly explained in the **Ninth Layer** (Chapter 9: Arising of Teachings); it is also briefly shown in the 'Inclusion of Dharmas' (Chapter 4).

### 5. Returning to the Great Abode (*Guī Dàchù*) - The Ultimate Goal (*Zhǐguī*)

"**5. Returning to the Great Abode:**
Because all dharmas are ultimately Empty, we expound this Cessation and Contemplation. Hands covered in glue stick easily; dreams in deep sleep are hard to wake from. People seal themselves in texts and equate [their limited understanding] with the meaning, claiming they are right. They compete in grasping tiles and pebbles, calling them lapis lazuli beads. They do not even recognize the obvious affairs near at hand; how can they not be confused by the distant principles and secret teachings? For this reason, we must discuss the **Ultimate Goal** (*Zhǐguī*).

**Definition of Zhǐguī:**
*   **Zhǐ (Purport/Gist):** Moving towards the Three Virtues (*Sāndé*) oneself.
*   **Guī (Return/Destination):** Leading others to enter the same Three Virtues.
*   Alternatively: Entering the Three Virtues oneself is 'Return'; causing others to enter is 'Purport.'
*   Ideally, both Self and Other entering the Secret Store (*Mìmì Zàng*) is named *Zhǐguī*.

**A. The General Mark (*Zǒngxiàng*):**
All Buddhas appear for the 'One Great Cause and Condition' (Lotus Sutra) to cause beings to see the **Dharma Body**. Once the Dharma Body is seen, Buddha and Beings both return to the Dharma Body.
*   The Buddha speaks all wisdoms to lead beings to the **All-Knowledge** (*Sarvajñā*); once complete, both return to **Prajñā** (Wisdom).
*   The Buddha manifests all powers to liberate beings; once liberated, both return to **Liberation** (*Mokṣa*).
The *Great Sutra* says: 'I place all children in the Secret Store, and I myself will also abide therein shortly.' This is the General Ultimate Goal.

**B. The Specific Marks (*Biéxiàng*):**
We analyze the Three Virtues through three aspects:

1.  **The Three Bodies:**
    *   **Fleshly Body:** Returns to Liberation.
    *   **Dharma-Gate Body:** Returns to Prajñā.
    *   **Real-Mark Body:** Returns to Dharma Body.
    *   *Ultimately:* All three return to the **Secret Store of Three Virtues**.

2.  **The Three Wisdoms:**
    *   **Wisdom of the Way** (*Dàozhǒngzhì*): Knowing the specific cures for beings (Conventional Truth) → Returns to Liberation.
    *   **All-Wisdom** (*Yíqièzhì*): Knowing the Emptiness of all things (Ultimate Truth) → Returns to Prajñā.
    *   **Universal All-Wisdom** (*Yíqièzhǒngzhì*): Knowing the Middle Way → Returns to Dharma Body.
    *   *Ultimately:* All return to the Secret Store.

3.  **The Three Liberations:**
    *   **Liberation from Non-Knowing:** Returns to Liberation.
    *   **Liberation from Grasping Marks:** Returns to Prajñā.
    *   **Liberation from Ignorance:** Returns to Dharma Body.
    *   *Ultimately:* All return to the Secret Store.

**C. The Dialectic of New and Old:**
*   **The Three Obstacles (Old):** Ignorance, Grasping Marks, Non-Knowing. These were present before.
*   **The Three Virtues (New):** Dharma Body, Prajñā, Liberation. These are revealed now.
*   **The Non-Duality:** But wait! The Obstacle *is* the Virtue. Ignorance *is* illumination. So the 'Old' is not old, and the 'New' is not new.
    *   If you understand this, there is no coming or going.
    *   If you teach this, you lead others to the same Secret Store.

**Conclusion:**
What is the Ultimate Goal? Where does it return? Who returns?
The path of language is cut off; the place of mental activity is extinguished. Eternally quiescent like space. This is named *Zhǐguī*. This will be broadly explained in the **Tenth Layer** (Chapter 10: The Ultimate Goal)."

## 📜 Doctrinal Analysis

1.  **The Great Net:** This refers to the vast, confusing array of Buddhist sutras (84,000 teachings). Without the "Key" (Zhiguan/Middle Way), one gets tangled in the net, thinking "This sutra contradicts that one." Rending the Net means seeing the unity (One Vehicle) behind the diversity.
2.  **The Secret Store (*Mìmì Zàng*):** A term from the *Nirvana Sutra*. It refers to the **Three Virtues** (*Sāndé*): Dharma Body (*Fǎshēn*), Wisdom (*Bōrě*), and Liberation (*Jiětuō*). They are "Secret" not because they are hidden, but because they are too profound for the deluded mind to see. They are a "Store" because they contain all dharmas.
3.  **New vs. Old:** Master Zhiyi uses a brilliant dialectic here. Conventional practice moves from "Old" (Defilement) to "New" (Enlightenment). But from the view of the Perfect Teaching, the Defilement *is* the Enlightenment. Thus, the "New" is not new (it was always there), and the "Old" is not old (it has no substance). This is the **"Identity of Defilement and Bodhi."**
