"**6. Clarifying the Preparatory Expedients (*Míng Fāngbiàn*):**
'Expedient' (*Fāngbiàn*) means skillful means (*Shànqiǎo*). Through skillful practice, even a small root of goodness can lead to immeasurable practice and understanding, entering the Bodhisattva position.
We distinguish between 'Far' and 'Near' expedients within the Nominal (*Jiǎmíng*) stage (before the Five Products):
*   **The Twenty-Five Methods** are the **Far Expedients** (*Yuǎn Fāngbiàn*).
*   **The Ten Objects of Contemplation** are the **Near Expedients** (*Jìn Fāngbiàn*).

Now we explain the Twenty-Five Methods, grouped into five sets of five:

---

### 1. Fulfilling the Five Conditions (*Jù Wǔyuán*)
1.  **Observing the Precepts Purely (*Chíjied Qīngjìng*):**
    *   **Action:** Not violating the heavy or light precepts. If violated, one must repent (*Chànhuǐ*).
    *   **Principle:** Observing the emptiness of the crime and the repenter.
2.  **Clothing and Food Sufficient (*Yīshí Jùzú*):**
    *   **Clothing:** Just enough to cover the body and protect from cold/heat. Like the hermit's grass robe or the disciple's three robes.
    *   **Food:** Not too much, not too little. Avoiding foods that increase anger (pungent) or stupidity (heavy).
3.  **Dwelling in a Quiet Place (*Xiánjū Jìngchù*):**
    *   **Deep Mountain:** For those with strong dhyana.
    *   **Head-Dharuta:** Staying in graveyards or under trees.
    *   **Monastery (Araṇya):** A quiet cell within a community.
4.  **Ceasing Relations/Duties (*Xī Zhū Yuánwù*):**
    *   **Livelihood:** Business, trade.
    *   **Human Affairs:** Social calls, letters.
    *   **Skills:** Medicine, divination, magic, art.
    *   **Learning:** Reading, reciting, debating (if it hinders meditation).
5.  **Drawing Near to Good Friends (*Dé Shànzhīshì*):**
    *   **External Protector:** Provides food/shelter.
    *   **Fellow Practitioner:** Encourages and accompanies.
    *   **Teaching Master:** Instructs in the method and clears doubts.

### 2. Reprimanding the Five Desires (*Hē Wǔyù*)
Reprimanding the desires of the five senses (Form, Sound, Smell, Taste, Touch).
*   **Reason:** Desires are like a dog chewing a dry bone (tasteless), like holding a torch against the wind (burns the hand), like a piece of meat (birds compete for it).
*   **Action:** Consciously rejecting the grasping mind when it moves towards these objects.

### 3. Casting Away the Five Hindrances (*Qì Wǔgài*)
1.  **Greed (*Tānyù*):** The desire for the five pleasures. (Cure: Contemplation of Impurity).
2.  **Anger (*Chēnhuì*):** Resentment and rage. (Cure: Compassion).
3.  **Sleep (*Shuìmián*):** Heaviness and stupor. (Cure: Energy/Visualizing Light).
4.  **Restlessness and Regret (*Diàohuǐ*):** The mind scattering (Diao) or worrying about past deeds (Hui). (Cure: Counting Breath).
5.  **Doubt (*Yí*):** Doubting the self, the teacher, or the dharma. (Cure: Faith/Understanding).

### 4. Adjusting the Five Matters (*Tiáo Wǔshì*)
This is the art of tuning the body and mind like a lute.
1.  **Adjusting Diet:** Not too full (causes sleep/blockage), not too hungry (causes weakness/instability).
2.  **Adjusting Sleep:** Not too much (stupor), not too little (restlessness).
3.  **Adjusting Body (Posture):**
    *   **Entering:** Arrange the cushion, cross legs (Full/Half Lotus), straighten the spine (like a stack of coins), relax shoulders, close mouth (teeth touch, tongue on palate), eyes slightly open (or closed, depending on drowsiness).
    *   **Abiding:** Maintain the posture without tension or collapsing.
    *   **Exiting:** Move slowly. Do not rise suddenly. Massage the body.
4.  **Adjusting Breath:**
    *   **Wind (*Fēng*):** Audible breathing. (Too rough).
    *   **Gasp (*Chuǎn*):** Jerky breathing. (Too tense).
    *   **Qi (*Qì*):** Stagnant/Laborious. (Too tired).
    *   **Breath (*Xī*):** Silent, continuous, fine, persisting. This is the correct mark.
    *   **Method:** If wind, relax. If gasp, settle. If qi, visualize the pores opening. Aim for the fine Breath.
5.  **Adjusting Mind:**
    *   **Sinking (*Chén*):** Mind is dull/sleepy. (Cure: Focus attention upward, e.g., nose tip/hairline).
    *   **Floating (*Fú*):** Mind is scattered/excited. (Cure: Focus attention downward, e.g., navel/soles of feet).

### 5. Practicing the Five Dharmas (*Xíng Wǔfǎ*)
1.  **Desire (*Yù*):** A strong wish to attain the path.
2.  **Effort (*Jīngjìn*):** Unremitting diligence.
3.  **Mindfulness (*Niàn*):** Remembering the goal and the method.
4.  **Wisdom (*Qiǎohuǐ*):** Discriminating between the true/false, loss/gain.
5.  **Single-mindedness (*Yīxīn*):** Determining the mind like a diamond."

## 📜 Doctrinal Analysis

1.  **The "Far" Expedients:** Why are they called "Far"? Because they are the *external* preparation. The "Near" expedients (Ten Objects) are the *internal* mental work.
2.  **The Art of Adjustment:** Section 4 (Adjusting Five Matters) is one of the most practical guides in Buddhist literature. It treats meditation not just as a mental act but as a physiological one. The distinction between Wind, Gasp, Qi, and Breath (*Xī*) is a classic Tiantai diagnostic tool for breath meditation.
3.  **Exiting Meditation (*Chū Dìng*):** Zhiyi places great emphasis on *how* one leaves meditation. Moving too fast can cause "meditation sickness" (headache, joint pain). One must transition from fine to coarse slowly.
