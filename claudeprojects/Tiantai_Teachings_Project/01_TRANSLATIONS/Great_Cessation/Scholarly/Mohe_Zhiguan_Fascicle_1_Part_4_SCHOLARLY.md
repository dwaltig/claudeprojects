# Mohe Zhiguan - Fascicle 1: The Three Texts and the Power of Words (Scholarly)

## Source Text
> 既信其法，須知三文：《次第禪門》合三十卷，今之十軸，是大莊嚴寺法慎私記；不定文者，如《六妙門》，以不定意歷十二禪、九想、八背、觀練熏修、因緣、六度，無礙旋轉縱橫自在，此是陳尚書令毛喜請智者出此文也；圓頓文者，如灌頂荊洲玉泉寺所記十卷是也。雖有三文，無得執文而自疣害。論云：「若見若不見般若，皆縛皆脫。」文亦例然。
>
> 疑者云：「『諸法寂滅相，不可以言宣。』《大經》云：『生生不可說，乃至不生不生不可說。』若通若別，言語道斷，無能說無所說。身子云：『吾聞解脫之中無有言說，故吾於此不知所云。』《淨名》云：『其所說者無說無示，其聽法者無聞無得。』斯人不能說，斯法不可說，而言示人？」
>
> 然但引一邊，不見其二。《大經》云：「有因緣故，亦可得說。」《法華》云：「無數方便，種種因緣，為眾生說」又云：「以方便力故，為五比丘說」。若通若別，皆可得說。《大經》云：「有眼者為盲人說乳。」此指真諦可說。《天王般若》云：「總持無文字，文字顯總持。」此指俗諦可說。又如來常依二諦說法。《淨名》云：「文字性離，即是解脫。」即說是無說。《大經》云：「若知如來常不說法，是即多聞。」此指不說而是說也。《思益》云：「佛及弟子常行二事，若說若默。」《法華》云：「去來坐立，常宣妙法，如注大雨。」又云：「若欲求佛道，常隨多聞人；善知識者是大因緣，所謂化導令得見佛。」《大經》云：「空中雲雷生象牙上華。」何時一向無說？
>
> 若競說默，不解教意，去理逾遠。離說無理，離理無說，即說無說，無說即說，無二無別，即事而真。大悲憐愍一切無聞，如月隱重山，舉扇類之；風息太虛，動樹訓之。今人意鈍，玄覽則難；眼依色入，假文則易。若封文為害，須知文非文，達一切文非文非不文，能於一文得一切解。為此義故，以三種文作達一門也。已略說緣起竟。

## 🏛️ The Architect's Translation

"Having believed in the Dharma, one must know the **Three Texts**:
1.  **The Gradual Text:** *The Sequence of the Dharma-gate of Dhyāna* (*Cìdì Chánmén*), totaling thirty volumes. The current ten scrolls are the private records made by **Fashen** of Dazhuangyan Monastery.
2.  **The Variable Text:** Such as the *Six Subtle Dharma-gates* (*Liùmiào Mén*). It uses the 'Variable' intent to cycle through the twelve dhyānas, nine perceptions, eight renunciations, and the six paramitas—rotating without obstruction, vertical and horizontal, in total self-existence (*zìzài*). Master Zhiyi produced this text at the request of **Mao Xi**, the Minister of the Chen Dynasty.
3.  **The Perfect/Sudden Text:** This is the current work [the *Mohe Zhiguan*], recorded in ten scrolls by **Guanding** at Yuquan Monastery in Jingzhou.

Although there are three texts, one must not grasp the words and thereby harm oneself. The *Treatise* says: 'Whether one sees or does not see Prajñā, both can be bondage or liberation.' The same is true for these texts.

**The Debate on the Sayable and Unsayable:**
The skeptic asks: 'The marks of all dharmas are quiescent and extinguished; they cannot be proclaimed in words. The *Great Sutra* says: "Birth-birth cannot be spoken... up to Unborn-unborn cannot be spoken." Whether general or specific, the path of language is cut off; there is no speaker and nothing to be spoken. **Śāriputra** (Shenzi) said: "I have heard that within liberation there is no speech, thus I do not know what to say here." The *Vimalakīrti Sutra* says: "That which is spoken has no speaking and no demonstration; those who hear the Dharma have no hearing and no attainment." If the person cannot speak and the Dharma cannot be spoken, how can you demonstrate it to people?'

Answer: You are merely citing one side and do not see the other. The *Great Sutra* says: '**Due to causes and conditions, it can also be spoken.**' The *Lotus Sutra* says: 'With countless expedients and various causes and conditions, I speak for sentient beings.' And: 'Using the power of expedients, I spoke for the five bhikshus.' Whether general or specific, all can be spoken.

*   The *Great Sutra* says: 'One with eyes explains [the color of] milk to a blind person.' This refers to the **Supreme Truth** (*Zhēndì*) being sayable.
*   The *Prājñā of the Heavenly King* says: 'The Dharani has no letters, but letters demonstrate the Dharani.' This refers to the **Conventional Truth** (*Súdì*) being sayable.
*   Furthermore, the Tathagata always relies on the **Two Truths** to expound the Dharma.
*   The *Vimalakīrti Sutra* says: 'The nature of letters is detachment; that is immediately liberation.' This means **Speaking is immediately No-Speaking**.
*   The *Great Sutra* says: 'If one knows the Tathagata never expounds the Dharma, that is being "much-heard" (*bahuśruta*).' This refers to **No-Speaking being immediately Speaking**.
*   The *Brahma-paripṛcchā* (Siyi) says: 'The Buddha and his disciples always perform two things: either speaking or silence.'
*   The *Lotus Sutra* says: 'Whether coming or going, sitting or standing, he always proclaims the Marvelous Dharma, like pouring rain.'

When did it ever exclusively mean 'No-Speaking'? If one contests over speech versus silence, they do not understand the intent of the teaching and drift further from the Principle. There is no Principle apart from speech, and no speech apart from the Principle. Speaking is No-Speaking; No-Speaking is Speaking. They are non-dual and without distinction—the **Phenomenon is immediately the Truth** (*Jìshì-ér-zhēn*).

Out of Great Compassion and pity for all who have not heard, [we use words]. If the moon is hidden behind heavy mountains, one points to a fan to illustrate it [by analogy of shape?]. If the wind stops in the Great Void, one moves a tree to teach of it. People today have dull minds; it is difficult for them to perceive the profound directly. Since the eye relies on form to enter, it is easier to use the 'false' words.
If you 'seal' the words (attach to them), they become harmful. You must know that **Words are not Words**. Attain the understanding that all words are neither words nor non-words; then you can obtain all understanding from a single word. For this reason, we use the Three Texts to create a single gateway of penetration.

**The Brief Explanation of the Conditions of Arising (*Yuánqǐ*) is now finished.**"

## 📜 Doctrinal Analysis

1.  **The Threefold Canon (三文):** Master Zhiyi establishes a comprehensive curriculum. He doesn't just offer one path; he provides three distinct "textual bodies" for the Gradual, Variable, and Perfect approaches. This shows the Tiantai system's holistic nature.
2.  **Bondage vs. Liberation (縛脫):** This is a key hermeneutical rule. The text itself is neutral. If you grasp it literally, it's a chain (bondage); if you use it to see the Truth, it's a key (liberation).
3.  **The Dialectic of Speech and Silence:** This is a classic Mahayana deconstruction. Zhiyi refuses the binary of "it's beyond words" versus "words can explain it." He asserts that the Principle (*Lǐ*) and the Expression (*Shuō*) are non-dual.
4.  **"Phenomenon is immediately the Truth" (即事而真):** This is one of the most important phrases in Tiantai. It means the absolute truth is not found *behind* or *after* the world of things, but *in* the very act of speaking and living.
5.  **Pedagogical Compassion:** The metaphors of the fan and the moving tree are beautiful. Words are "expedient means" (*upāya*). They are not the moon or the wind, but they are necessary pointers for those who cannot see them directly.
6.  **Conclusion of the Introduction:** This marks the end of the *Xù* (Introduction) or *Yuánqǐ* (Origins) of the *Mohe Zhiguan*. The text will now move into the first of the ten chapters: the **Grand Purpose** (*Dàyì*).
