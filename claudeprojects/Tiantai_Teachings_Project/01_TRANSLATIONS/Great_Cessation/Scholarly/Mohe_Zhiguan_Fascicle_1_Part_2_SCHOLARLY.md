# Mohe Zhiguan - Fascicle 1: Clarifying the Perfect and Sudden (Scholarly)

## Source Text
> 「漸」與「不定」置而不論，今依經更明圓頓。如了達甚深妙德賢首曰：「菩薩於生死，最初發心時，一向求菩提，堅固不可動。彼一念功德，深廣無崖際，如來分別說，窮劫不能盡。」此菩薩聞圓法、起圓信、立圓行、住圓位、以圓功德而自莊嚴、以圓力用建立眾生。

> 云何「聞圓法」？聞「生死即法身」、「煩惱即般若」、「結業即解脫」。雖有三名而無三體，雖是一體而立三名，是三即一相，其實無有異。法身究竟，般若解脫亦究竟。般若清淨，餘亦清淨。解脫自在，餘亦自在。聞一切法亦如是，皆具佛法，無所減少，是名「聞圓法」。
>
> 云何「圓信」？信一切法即空即假即中，無一二三而一二三，無一二三是遮一二三，而一二三是照一二三，無遮無照皆究竟、清淨、自在。聞深不怖，聞廣不疑，聞非深非廣意而有勇，是名「圓信」。
>
> 云何「圓行」？一向專求無上菩提，即邊而中，不餘趣向，三諦圓修。不為無邊所寂、有邊所動，不動不寂直入中道，是名「圓行」。
>
> 云何「入圓位」？入初住時，一住一切住，一切究竟，一切清淨，一切自在，是名「圓位」。
>
> 云何「圓自在莊嚴」？彼經廣說自在相，或於此根入正受，或於彼根起出說，或於一根雙入出，或於一根不入出，餘一一根亦如是。或於此塵入正受，或於彼塵起出說，或於一塵雙入出，或於一塵不入出，餘一一塵亦如是。或於此方入正受，或於彼方起出說，或於一方雙入出，或於一方不入出。或於一物入正受，或於一物起出說，或於一物雙入出，或於一物不入出。若委說者，秖於一根一塵即入即出、即雙入出、即不入出，於正報中一一自在，於依報中亦如是，是名「圓自在莊嚴」。譬如日光周四天下，一方中，一方旦，一方夕，一方夜半，輪迴不同，秖是一日而四處見異，菩薩自在亦如是。
>
> 云何「圓建立眾生」？或放一光，能令眾生得即空即假即中益，得入出、雙入出、不入出益，歷行住坐臥語默作作亦如是。有緣者見，如目覩光；無緣不覺，盲瞽常闇。故舉龍王為譬，竪遍六天、橫亘四域，興種種雲、震種種雷、耀種種電、降種種雨，龍於本宮不動不搖，而於一切施設不同。菩薩亦如是，內自通達即空即假即中，不動法性而令獲種種益、得種種用，是名「圓力用建立眾生」。初心尚爾，況中、後心？如來殷勤稱歎此法，聞者歡喜。常啼東請，善財南求，藥王燒手，普明刎頭，一日三捨恒河沙身，尚不能報一句之力，況兩肩荷負百千萬劫，寧報佛法之恩？一經一說如此，餘經亦然。

## 🏛️ The Architect's Translation

"Leaving aside the 'Gradual' and the 'Variable,' we shall now further clarify the **Perfect and Sudden** (*Yuándùn*) based on the sutras. As the one who has thoroughly understood the profoundly deep and marvelous virtue, [Bodhisattva] **Bhadrashri** (Xianshou), said: 'When a Bodhisattva, within [the cycle of] birth and death, first arouses the mind, they are single-mindedly devoted to seeking Bodhi, firm and immovable. The merit of that single thought is deep and broad without boundaries; even if the Tathāgata were to explain it discriminatively, he could not exhaust it in an entire kalpa.'

This Bodhisattva hears the **Round Dharma**, gives rise to **Round Faith**, establishes **Round Practice**, abides in the **Round Position**, adorns themselves with **Round Merit**, and establishes sentient beings with **Round Power**.

**1. What is 'Hearing the Round Dharma'?**
It is hearing that 'Samsara is immediately the Dharma-body,' 'Affliction is immediately Prajñā,' and 'Karmic Bondage is immediately Liberation.' Although there are three names, there are not three substances. Although it is a single substance, three names are established. These three are a single mark; in reality, there is no difference. If the Dharma-body is ultimate, then Prajñā and Liberation are also ultimate. If Prajñā is pure, the others are also pure. If Liberation is self-existent (*zìzài*), the others are also self-existent. Hearing that all dharmas are also like this—all being complete with the Buddha-Dharma without any decrease—is named 'Hearing the Round Dharma.'

**2. What is 'Round Faith'?**
It is believing that all dharmas are immediately Empty, immediately Provisional, and immediately the Middle. It is not one, two, or three, yet it is one, two, and three. 'Not one, two, or three' negates [the distinction of] one, two, and three; yet 'one, two, and three' illuminates one, two, and three. Neither negating nor illuminating, all is ultimate, pure, and self-existent. Hearing of the deep, one is not terrified; hearing of the broad, one does not doubt; hearing of that which is neither deep nor broad, the mind remains courageous. This is named 'Round Faith.'

**3. What is 'Round Practice'?**
It is single-mindedly seeking Unsurpassed Bodhi, reaching the Middle through the extremes, without any other orientation. It is the simultaneous cultivation of the **Three Truths**. One is not silenced by the 'limitless' (emptiness) nor moved by the 'limited' (existence). Neither moving nor silent, one enters directly into the Middle Way. This is named 'Round Practice.'

**4. What is 'Entering the Round Position'?**
Upon entering the First Abode (*Chùzhù*), one abode is all abodes. Everything is ultimate, everything is pure, everything is self-existent. This is named the 'Round Position.'

**5. What is 'Round Self-Existent Ornament'?**
That sutra (*Avatamsaka*) extensively explains the characteristics of self-existence: Sometimes entering meditative absorption (*samādhi*) through this sense-organ and emerging to speak through that sense-organ; sometimes both entering and emerging through a single sense-organ; sometimes neither entering nor emerging through a single sense-organ—the same applies to all other sense-organs. Sometimes entering through this object (*dust*) and emerging through that object... the same applies to all directions and all things.
In detail: within a single sense-organ or a single object, one simultaneously enters, emerges, both, or neither. One is self-existent in every aspect of the 'Principal Retribution' (the body) and the 'Dependent Retribution' (the environment). This is named 'Round Self-Existent Ornament.'
It is like the sunlight circling the four continents: in one place it is noon, in another dawn, in another dusk, and in another midnight. The cycle is different, yet it is only one sun, seen differently in four places. The Bodhisattva's self-existence is also like this.

**6. What is 'Round Establishing of Sentient Beings'?**
Sometimes emitting a single light that enables sentient beings to obtain the benefit of 'immediately Empty, immediately Provisional, immediately the Middle,' and the benefit of entering, emerging, both, or neither—the same applies to walking, standing, sitting, lying down, speaking, silence, and action. Those with conditions see it like eyes seeing light; those without conditions are unaware, like the blind in constant darkness.
The **Dragon King** is used as a metaphor: he vertically pervades the six heavens and horizontally spans the four regions, giving rise to various clouds, shaking various thunders, flashing various lightnings, and raining various rains. The Dragon remains in his palace, unmoved and unshaken, yet his manifestations are all different.
The Bodhisattva is also like this: inwardly penetrating 'immediately Empty, immediately Provisional, immediately the Middle,' without moving from the Dharma-nature, yet causing others to obtain various benefits and uses. This is named 'Round Power for Establishing Sentient Beings.'

If the initial mind is already like this, how much more so the middle and final minds? The Tathāgata earnestly praises this法 (Dharma), and those who hear it are joyful. **Sadāprarudita** (Ever-Wailing) sought it in the East, **Sudhana** sought it in the South; **Medicine King** burned his arms, **King Prabasat** offered his head. Sacrificing a body as numerous as the sands of the Ganges three times a day still cannot repay the power of a single sentence. How then could carrying [the Dharma] on both shoulders for hundreds of thousands of millions of kalpas repay the debt of the Buddha's Dharma? This is true for one sutra and one explanation; it is true for all other sutras as well."

## 📜 Doctrinal Analysis

1.  **The Six Rounds (六圓):** Master Zhiyi organizes the Perfect/Sudden path into six aspects: Dharma, Faith, Practice, Position, Ornament (Merit), and Benefit (Establishing beings). This mirrors the "Six Identities" but emphasizes the *simultaneity* and *interpenetration* of the Perfect teaching.
2.  **The Threefold Identity (三即):** The core of "Round Dharma" is the identity of the Three Truths. Samsara/Affliction/Karma are not to be escaped but are recognized as the Dharma-body/Prajñā/Liberation. This is the **"Subtlety of Objects"** (境妙).
3.  **The Four-fold Meditative Manifestation:** The description of "entering and emerging" through different organs or objects illustrates the **"Non-Obstruction of Phenomenon and Phenomenon"** (事事無礙). The Bodhisattva's wisdom is so fluid that it is not tied to a specific physical or mental channel.
4.  **The Sun and Dragon Metaphors:**
    *   **The Sun:** Illustrates that the One (Truth) appears as many (stages/benefits) depending on the position of the observer (beings), while remaining unchanged in itself.
    *   **The Dragon:** Illustrates the "Action without Action." The Bodhisattva remains in the "Inner Palace" of the Middle Way while manifesting universal compassion.
5.  **Repaying the Debt (報恩):** The final section emphasizes the supreme value of the Round Dharma. Traditional sacrifices (limbs, lives) are insufficient to repay even a single phrase of this "Perfect and Sudden" teaching, highlighting its status as the "King of Teachings."
