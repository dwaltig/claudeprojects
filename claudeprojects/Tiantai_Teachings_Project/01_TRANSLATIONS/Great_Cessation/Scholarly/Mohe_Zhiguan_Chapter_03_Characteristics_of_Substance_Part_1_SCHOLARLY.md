## 🏛️ The Architect's Translation

"**3. Explaining the Substance and Characteristics (*Tǐxiāng*) of Cessation and Contemplation:**
Having understood the Grand Purpose (*Dàyì*) as open and broad, and the Name (*Míngzì*) as far-reaching, we must now recognize the Substance (*Tǐ*) as abyssal and mysterious. We roughly use four concepts to reveal the Substance:
1.  **Teaching Characteristics** (*Jiàoxiàng*)
2.  **Eye and Wisdom** (*Yǎn Zhì*)
3.  **Boundary/Object** (*Jìngjiè*)
4.  **Gain and Loss** (*Dé Shī*)

---

### 1. Teaching Characteristics (*Jiàoxiàng*)
We use the characteristics of the Teaching to distinguish the specific Substance.
*   **Common/Ordinary (*Fán*) Zhiguan:** The Four Dhyanas and Four Immeasurables. These are 'Leakage' (*Yǒulòu*) characteristics. Not what we discuss here.
*   **Two Vehicle (*Èrchéng*) Zhiguan:** Nine Thoughts, Eight Liberations. These are 'Clumsy' (*Zhuō*) means, extinguishing form to enter emptiness. Not what we discuss here.

**The Skillful (*Qiǎo*) Zhiguan (Mahayana):**
There are three kinds of 'Stop' (*Zhǐ*) and three kinds of 'Look' (*Guān*).

#### A. The Three Kinds of Cessation (*Sān Zhǐ*)
1.  **Substantializing the Real Stop (*Tǐzhēn Zhǐ*):**
    Knowing that all dharmas arise from conditions, and causes/conditions are empty without a master. By 'Substantializing' (*Tǐ*) the empty nature of the false union, the wandering mind rests. Emptiness is the Real (*Zhēn*). This stops the illness of attachment to existence. (Corresponds to the **Empty** View).
2.  **Expedient Means Following Conditions Stop (*Fāngbiàn Suíyuán Zhǐ*):**
    The Bodhisattva knows that Emptiness is not the ultimate end. For the sake of saving beings, they do not abide in Emptiness but use 'Expedient Means' (*Fāngbiàn*) to enter the temporary existence ('Following Conditions'). The mind is at peace in the Secular Truth (*Súdì*). This stops the illness of attachment to emptiness/nirvana. (Corresponds to the **Provisional** View).
3.  **Resting the Two Extremes Stop (*Xī Èrbiān Zhǐ*):**
    Samsara (Existence) and Nirvana (Emptiness) are both extremes. Neither accords with the Middle Way. Now, knowing that the Secular is not just Secular (it is Empty) and the Empty is not just Empty (it is possessed of function), one rests in the **Middle Way**, stopping both extremes. (Corresponds to the **Middle** View).

#### B. The Three Kinds of Contemplation (*Sān Guān*)
1.  **Entering Emptiness from the Provisional (*Cóng Jiǎ Rù Kōng*):**
    This is the **'Two Truths Contemplation'** (*Èrdì Guān*). One views the 'False' (Provisional) as a means to enter the 'Empty'. By analyzing or substantializing the false, one realizes Emptiness. This breaks the delusion of Views and Thoughts (*Jiàn Sī*).
2.  **Entering the Provisional from Emptiness (*Cóng Kōng Rù Jiǎ*):**
    This is the **'Equality Contemplation'** (*Píngděng Guān*). If one stays in Emptiness, one cannot help others. One must emerge from the Empty to enter the False (Provisional), distinguishing all dharmas (medicines/diseases) to save beings. This breaks the delusion of Dust and Sand (*Chénshā* - Ignorance of particulars).
3.  **The Middle Way Supreme Truth Contemplation (*Zhōngdào Dìyīyì Dì Guān*):**
    This contemplates that the previous two (Empty/False) are expedient means. It double-illuminates (*Shuāngzhào*) the Two Truths, seeing them as the One Reality. This breaks the delusion of Fundamental Ignorance (*Wúmíng*).

**The Perfect and Sudden Integration (*Yuándùn*):**
In the Perfect Teaching, these are not three sequential steps.
*   The **Three Stops** are **One Stop**. (Stopping one extreme stops all; abiding in one truth abides in all).
*   The **Three Looks** are **One Look**. (In one mind, one sees Empty, Provisional, and Middle simultaneously).
*   **One Mind, Three Truths** (*Yīxīn Sāndì*).
*   Like the three eyes of Maheśvara (Śiva) on one face; or the three dots of the letter 'I'. They are neither vertical nor horizontal."

## 📜 Doctrinal Analysis

1.  **Ti-Zhen (Substantializing the Real):** Unlike the "Analytical" (*Xī*) emptiness of the Hinayana (breaking a cup to see it's not a cup), this is "Substantial" emptiness (seeing the cup *is* empty right now). This is the hallmark of Mahayana emptiness.
2.  **Entering the Provisional:** This is the unique Bodhisattva path. The Arhat enters Emptiness and stays there (Nirvana). The Bodhisattva enters Emptiness, realizes it's just a state, and *comes back* to the Provisional world to work, but without attachment. This "Coming Back" is the *Cong Kong Ru Jia*.
3.  **The Middle Way:** The integration. It's not a third place. It's realizing that the Empty (Absolute) and the Provisional (Relative) are the same thing. Samsara *is* Nirvana. This is the **Perfect Substance**.
