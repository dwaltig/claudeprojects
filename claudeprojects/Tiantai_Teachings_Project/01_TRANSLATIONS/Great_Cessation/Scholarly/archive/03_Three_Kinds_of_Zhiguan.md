# Mohe Zhiguan - Fascicle 1: The Three Kinds of Zhiguan (Scholarly)

> 天台傳南岳三種止觀：一、漸次，二、不定，三、圓頓，皆是大乘，俱緣實相，同名止觀。
>
> 「漸」則初淺後深，如彼梯隥；「不定」前後更互，如金剛寶置之日中；「圓頓」初後不二，如通者騰空。為三根性，說三法門、引三譬喻。略說竟，更廣說。
>
> 「漸」，初亦知實相，實相難解，漸次易行。先修歸戒，翻邪向正，止火血刀，達三善道。次修禪定，止欲、散網，達色、無色定道。次修無漏，止三界獄，達涅槃道。次修慈悲，止於自證，達菩薩道。後修實相，止二邊偏，達常住道。是為初淺後深漸次止觀相。
>
> 「不定」者，無別階位，約前漸後頓，更前更後，互淺互深；或事或理，或指「世界」為「第一義」，或指「第一義」為「為人」、「對治」；或息觀為止，或照止為觀，故名不定止觀。疑者云：「教境名同，相頓爾異。」然同而不同，不同而同。漸次中六，善惡各三，無漏總中三，凡十二不同，從多為言，故名不定。此章同大乘、同實相，同名止觀，何故名為辯差？然同而不同，不同而同。漸次中九不同，不定中四不同，總有十三不同，從多為言，故名不同耳。「一切聖人皆以無為法而有差別」即其義也。
>
> 「圓頓」者，初緣實相，造境即中，無不真實。繫緣法界，一念法界，一色一香無非中道。己界及佛界、眾生界亦然。陰入皆如，無苦可捨；無明、塵勞即是菩提，無集可斷；邊、邪皆中正，無道可修；生死即涅槃，無滅可證。無苦、無集，故無世間；無道、無滅，故無出世間。純一實相，實相外更無別法。法性寂然名「止」，寂而常照名「觀」。雖言初後，無二無別，是名「圓頓止觀」。

## 🏛️ The Architect's Translation

"Tiantai transmitted three kinds of Cessation and Contemplation from Nanyue [Huisi]: 1. **Gradual** (*Jiàncì*), 2. **Variable** (*Bùdìng*), 3. **Perfect/Sudden** (*Yuándùn*). All are Mahayana, all take the Real Mark (*Shíxiàng*) as their object, and all share the name Cessation and Contemplation.

*   **Gradual:** The beginning is shallow and the later stages are deep, like climbing a staircase.
*   **Variable:** The former and later stages alternate [without fixed order], like a diamond gem placed in the sun [reflecting differently].
*   **Perfect/Sudden:** The beginning and the end are not two, like a person with spiritual powers soaring into the sky.

These three Dharma-gates were spoken for three capacities, citing three metaphors. Having spoken briefly, [I will now] speak more broadly.

**1. The Gradual:**
Initially, one also knows the Real Mark, but the Real Mark is difficult to understand, whereas the gradual sequence is easy to practice.
*   First, one cultivates the Refuges and Precepts, turning from evil toward the upright, stopping the fire [of anger] and the blood-knife [of killing], attaining the Three Good Paths (human/heavenly).
*   Next, one cultivates Dhyāna meditation, stopping desire and the net of scattering, attaining the paths of Form and Formless meditations.
*   Next, one cultivates the Outflow-free (Anāsrava), stopping the prison of the Three Realms, attaining the path of Nirvāṇa.
*   Next, one cultivates Compassion, stopping at self-realization, attaining the Bodhisattva Path.
*   Finally, one cultivates the Real Mark, stopping the bias of the Two Extremes (Existence/Emptiness), attaining the Path of Constant Abiding.
This is the characteristic of the Gradual Cessation and Contemplation: shallow at first, deep at the end.

**2. The Variable:**
There are no distinct stages; relating the previous 'Gradual' to the subsequent 'Sudden,' they alternate before and after, mutually shallow and deep. Sometimes it is phenomenon (*Shì*), sometimes principle (*Lǐ*). Sometimes the 'Worldly' [Siddhanta] is pointed to as the 'Supreme Truth'; sometimes the 'Supreme Truth' is pointed to as 'For the Individual' or 'Counteractive.' Sometimes resting the contemplation is 'Stopping' (*Zhi*); sometimes illuminating the stopping is 'Contemplation' (*Guan*). Therefore, it is named Variable Cessation and Contemplation.

**3. The Perfect/Sudden:**
From the very beginning, one takes the Real Mark as the object. Whatever境 (object/mental state) is created is immediately the Middle Way; nothing is not True Reality. One binds one's conditions to the Dharma-realm; one thought is the Dharma-realm. One color, one fragrance—nothing is not the Middle Way. The self-realm, the Buddha-realm, and the realm of sentient beings are also like this.

The Skandhas and Entrances (Ayatanas) are all Thusness (*Rú*); there is no Suffering to be abandoned. Ignorance and dust-labors are immediately Bodhi; there is no Accumulation to be cut off. The extreme and the crooked are all the Middle-Upright; there is no Path to be cultivated. Samsara is immediately Nirvāṇa; there is no Extinction to be realized. Because there is no Suffering or Accumulation, there is no Worldly [Cause and Effect]; because there is no Path or Extinction, there is no Out-of-Worldly [Cause and Effect]. It is purely the single Real Mark; outside the Real Mark, there are no other dharmas.

The Dharma-nature remaining quiescent is named 'Stopping' (*Zhi*); quiescent yet constantly shining is named 'Contemplation' (*Guan*). Although we speak of beginning and end, there is no duality and no distinction. This is named the **Perfect and Sudden Cessation and Contemplation**."
