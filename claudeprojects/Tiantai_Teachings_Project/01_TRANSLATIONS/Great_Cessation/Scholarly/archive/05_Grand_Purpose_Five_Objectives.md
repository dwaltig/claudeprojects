## Source Text
> ○解釋者，釋十章也。初釋大意，囊括始終，冠戴初後，意緩難見。今撮為五，謂發大心、修大行、感大果、裂大網、歸大處。
>
> 云何發大心？眾生昏倒不自覺知，勸令醒悟，上求下化。
>
> 云何行大行？雖復發心，望路不動，永無達期，勸牢強精進，行四種三昧。
>
> 云何感大果？雖不求梵天，梵天自應，稱揚妙報，慰悅其心。
>
> 云何裂大網？種種經論開人眼目，而執此疑彼、是一非諸，聞雪謂冷乃至聞鶴謂動。今融通經論，解結出籠。
>
> 云何歸大處？法無始終，法無通塞。若知法界，法界無始終、無通塞，豁然大朗，無礙自在。

## 🏛️ The Architect's Translation

"**The Exegesis:** This explains the ten chapters. First, we explain the **Grand Purpose** (*Dàyì*). It encompasses the beginning and the end, crowning both the initial [stage] and the final [realization]. The meaning is broad and difficult to see; now we summarize it into five [objectives]:

1.  **Arousing the Great Mind** (*Fā Dàxīn*)
2.  **Cultivating the Great Practice** (*Xiū Dàxíng*)
3.  **Feeling the Great Fruit** (*Gǎn Dàguǒ*)
4.  **Rending the Great Net** (*Liè Dàwǎng*)
5.  **Returning to the Great Abode** (*Guī Dàchù*)

**1. Arousing the Great Mind:**
Sentient beings are confused and inverted, unaware and unknowing. [We] encourage them to awaken, seeking [Bodhi] above and transforming [beings] below.

**2. Cultivating the Great Practice:**
Although one has aroused the mind, if one looks at the road but does not move, there will never be a time of arrival. [We] encourage firm and strong diligence in practicing the **Four Kinds of Samadhi**.

**3. Feeling the Great Fruit:**
Although one does not seek the Brahma [Heaven], the Brahma Heaven responds of itself. We praise the marvelous retribution to comfort and gladden the mind.

**4. Rending the Great Net:**
Various sutras and treatises open people's eyes, but they grasp this and doubt that, affirming one and denying the many. Hearing of 'snow,' they say it is cold; hearing of a 'crane,' they say it moves [mistaking the description for the reality]. Now, we fuse and penetrate the sutras and treatises, untying the knots and releasing [birds] from the cage.

**5. Returning to the Great Abode:**
The Dharma has no beginning and no end; the Dharma has no blockage and no passage. If one knows the Dharma-realm, the Dharma-realm has no beginning or end, no blockage or passage. It is expansive and greatly clear, unobstructed and self-existent (*Zìzài*)."
