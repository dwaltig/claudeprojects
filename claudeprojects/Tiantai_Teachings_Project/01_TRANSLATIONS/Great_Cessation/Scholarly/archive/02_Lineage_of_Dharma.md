## 🏛️ The Architect's Translation

"The Greatly Awakened World-Honored One, having fulfilled the practices over accumulated kalpas, spent six years subduing [wrong] views and raised one finger to quell Mara. Beginning at the Deer Park, continuing at Vulture Peak, and ending at the Crane Grove, He entrusted the Dharma to **Mahākāśyapa**.

Kāśyapa divided the relics into eight portions, compiled the Tripiṭaka, and entrusted the Dharma to **Ānanda**.

Ānanda, entering the Wind Samādhi in the middle of the Ganges River, divided his body into four parts and entrusted the Dharma to **Śāṇavāsa**.

Śāṇavāsa [manifested] two sweet dews from his hands and revealed five hundred Dharma-gates, trusting the Dharma to **Upagupta**.

Upagupta attained the third fruit while a layman, and upon receiving the precepts attained the fourth fruit; he entrusted the Dharma to **Dhṛṭaka**.

Dhṛṭaka attained the first fruit upon ascending the altar, and the fourth fruit after the three karmavācanā (formal announcements); he entrusted the Dharma to **Miccaka**.

Miccaka entrusted to **Buddhanandi**.

Buddhanandi entrusted to **Buddhamitra**.

Buddhamitra conferred the Three Refuges upon the King, subdued a fortune-teller, and entrusted the Dharma to **Pārśva** (The Rib Bhikshu).

Pārśva was born with white hair and emitted light from his hands to retrieve sutras; he entrusted the Dharma to **PuṇyaYaśas**.

PuṇyaYaśas defeated **Aśvaghoṣa** in debate, shaving his head to make him a disciple. Aśvaghoṣa composed the *Rāṣṭrapāla Opera*; the sounds of the music expounded impermanence, suffering, and emptiness, causing those who heard it to awaken to the Way. He entrusted the Dharma to **Kapimala** (Bhikshu).

Kapimala composed the *Theory of No-Self*; wherever the treatise was directed, evil views were extinguished. He entrusted the Dharma to **Nāgārjuna**.

Nāgārjuna [obtained] a physical body from a tree and achieved the Dharma-body from a Dragon (Nāga); he entrusted the Dharma to **Kāṇadeva**.

Kāṇadeva gouged out a golden eye [from an idol] and donated ten thousand fleshly eyes [to the sick]; he entrusted the Dharma to **Rāhulata**.

Rāhulata understood the scripts of ghosts and names, subdued heretics, and entrusted the Dharma to **Saṅghanandi**.

Saṅghanandi spoke verses to test an Arhat and entrusted the Dharma to **Saṅghayaśas**.

Saṅghayaśas traveled the ocean, saw a city, spoke verses, and entrusted the Dharma to **Kumārata**.

Kumārata saw ten thousand horsemen and recorded the horses' colors, the riders' names, and distinguished their clothing; he entrusted the Dharma to **Jayata**.

Jayata created a fire pit for a man who had committed a grave offense, ordering him to enter it to repent; the pit became a pool, and the sin was extinguished. He entrusted the Dharma to **Vasubandhu**.

Vasubandhu entrusted to **Manorhita**.

Manorhita divided the Ganges River into two, transforming himself into one part, and entrusted the Dharma to **Haklenayaśas**.

Haklenayaśas entrusted to **Simha** (The Lion Bhikshu).

Simha was harmed by King Dammira; when the sword cut him, milk flowed [instead of blood].

**Summary of the Lineage:**
The transmitters of the Dharma Treasury begin with Kāśyapa and end with Simha, totaling twenty-three persons. If **Madhyāntika**, who received it at the same time as Śāṇavāsa, is included, then there are twenty-four. All these masters were predicted by the Golden Mouth [of the Buddha]; all were sages capable of great benefit.

In the past, a King would not establish a stable at a temple, but would establish it at a slaughterhouse [to save the animals? Or implying temples are too sacred?]. How much more so, in a good age, meeting a sage—how could there be no benefit? Furthermore, there was a Brahmin selling skulls; he checked if the holes [ears to ear] were passable, half-passable, or blocked. For the passable ones, he erected stupas and made offerings, attaining birth in heaven. If the merit of merely hearing the essence of Dharma [physically passing through the skull] is like this, it was for this benefit that the Buddha entrusted the Dharma Treasury."
