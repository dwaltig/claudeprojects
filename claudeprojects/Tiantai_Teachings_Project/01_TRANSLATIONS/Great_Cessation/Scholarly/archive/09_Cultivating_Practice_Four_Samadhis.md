> 二、勸進四種三昧入菩薩位。說是止觀者，夫欲登妙位，非行不階；善解鑽搖，醍醐可獲。《法華》云：「又見佛子，修種種行，以求佛道。」行法眾多，略言其四：一、常坐，二、常行，三、半行半坐，四、非行非坐。通稱「三昧」者，調直定也。《大論》云：「善心一處住不動，是名三昧。」法界是一處，正觀能住不動，四行為緣，觀心藉緣調直，故稱三昧也。

"**2. Encouraging the Great Practice (*Quànjìn Dàxíng*) to Enter the Bodhisattva Position.**
Explaining this Cessation and Contemplation: If one desires to ascend to the marvelous position, without practice one cannot scale [the heights]. By skillfully understanding the churning and shaking [of the milk], one can obtain ghee (*tíhú*). The *Lotus Sutra* says: 'Again, I see the Buddha's sons cultivating various practices to seek the Buddha-Way.' Although the methods of practice are numerous, we briefly discuss four:
1.  **Constant Sitting** (*Chángzuò*)
2.  **Constant Walking** (*Chángxíng*)
3.  **Part-Walking Part-Sitting** (*Bànxíng Bànzuò*)
4.  **Neither-Walking Nor-Sitting** (*Fēixíng Fēizuò*)

Generally, they are called **'Samadhi'** (*Sānmèi*), which means 'Rectifying and Establishing' (*Tiáozhí Dìng*). The *Great Treatise* (*Dàlùn*) says: 'A good mind abiding in one place without moving is named Samadhi.' The Dharma-realm is that 'One Place.' Correct contemplation can abide there without moving. The four behaviors are conditions (*yuán*); contemplating the mind relies on these conditions to become rectified and established, hence they are called Samadhi.

### 1. Constant Sitting Samadhi (*Chángzuò Sānmèi*)
(Also known as the 'One Act Samadhi' (*Yīxíng Sānmèi*) from the *Manjushri Prajna Sutra*).
*   **Method:** One dwells in a quiet room or an empty place, away from noise. One sets up a single rope bed (chair) with no other seats beside it. For a period of **ninety days**, one sits cross-legged (*jie jia*) facing a specific Buddha. The neck and spine must be straight; one must not move, shake, droop, or lean. One takes a vow only to sit. The ribs must not touch the bed [to lie down], let alone sleep like a corpse, play, or stand. Except for walking meditation (*jīngxíng*), eating, and toilet, one sits constantly facing the Buddha, moment to moment continuously.
*   **Contemplation:** One concentrates on the Dharma-realm (*Fǎjiè*). One thought is the Dharma-realm. One believes that all dharmas are the Buddha-Dharma. There is no before or after, no boundaries. One sees the Buddha's marks as if looking into a mirror, yet knows the Buddha does not come and I do not go.

### 2. Constant Walking Samadhi (*Chángxíng Sānmèi*)
(Also known as the 'Buddha-Standing Samadhi' (*Pratyutpanna*)).
*   **Method:** For **ninety days**, one constantly walks and never sits or lies down (except for eating/toilet). One must have good teachers and protectors. One adorns the sanctuary with offerings.
*   **Practice:** One constantly circumambulates while chanting the name of **Amitābha Buddha** (*Āmítuófó*). Each step, each sound, each thought is only on Amitābha.
*   **Contemplation:** One visualizes Amitābha standing before one, like seeing stars at night. One contemplates the Buddha's body marks and realizes: 'The Buddha does not come to me; I do not go to the Buddha.' The mind creates the Buddha.

### 3. Part-Walking Part-Sitting Samadhi (*Bànxíng Bànzuò*)
(Based on the *Lotus Sutra* and *Vaipulya/Fangdeng* Sutras).
*   **Vaipulya Repentance:** Seven days. One circumambulates 120 times, then sits and contemplates. One recites the Dhāraṇī, confesses sins, and washes the altar.
*   **Lotus Samadhi:** Twenty-one days (3 weeks). One recites the *Lotus Sutra* while walking and sitting. One visualizes **Samantabhadra** (*Pǔxián*) riding a six-tusked white elephant. One confesses the sins of the six senses.

### 4. Neither-Walking Nor-Sitting Samadhi (*Fēixíng Fēizuò*)
(Also known as 'Following One's Own Mind' (*Suízìyì*)).
*   **Method:** This is not limited to walking or sitting. It applies to all four postures (Walking, Standing, Sitting, Lying Down) and all actions.
*   **Practice:** In every act, one contemplates the mind. 'Awareness of Mind' (*Juéyì*). One observes: Where does this thought come from? Is it the mind? Is it not the mind?
*   **Application:** One applies this to the Ten Objects (Good, Evil, Neutral). Even when anger or desire arises, one contemplates its source and nature (as Empty, Provisional, Middle)."
