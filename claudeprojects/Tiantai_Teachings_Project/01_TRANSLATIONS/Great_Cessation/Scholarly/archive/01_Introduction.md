# Mohe Zhiguan - Fascicle 1: Introduction (Scholarly)

## Source Text
> 止觀明靜，前代未聞。智者，大隋開皇十四年四月二十六日，於荊州玉泉寺，一夏敷揚、二時慈霔，雖樂說不窮，纔至「見境」，法輪停轉，後分弗宣。然挹流尋源，聞香討根。論曰：「我行無師保。」經云：「受莂於定光。」書言：「生知者上，學而次良。」法門浩妙，為天真獨朗？為從藍而青？行人若聞《付法藏》，則識宗元。

## 🏛️ The Architect's Translation

"Cessation and Contemplation (*Zhǐguān*) are lucid and tranquil; in previous generations, they were unheard of. The Wise One (*Zhìzhě*), on the twenty-sixth day of the fourth month in the fourteenth year of the Kāihuáng era of the Great Suí (594 CE), at Yùquán Monastery in Jīngzhōu, spread and extolled [the teaching] for a whole summer, [and continued] the compassionate rain for two seasons. Although his joy in speaking was inexhaustible, he only reached the 'Views as Object' (*Jiànjìng*). The Wheel of Dharma stopped turning, and the latter portions were never proclaimed.

However, if one ladles from the stream to seek the source, or follows the scent to search for the root [one finds the lineage]. The *Treatise* states: 'I walk without a teacher or protector.' The *Sutra* says: '[He] received the prediction from Dīpaṃkara.' The *Book* [of History] remarks: 'Those born with knowledge are superior; those who learn it are next.' The Dharma-gate is vast and subtle; is it a solitary brightness of Heaven-endowed truth? Or is it like the blue derived from the indigo plant? If the practitioner hears the *Account of the Transmission of the Dharma Treasury* (*Fù Fǎzàng*), they will recognize the lineage and origin."

## Doctrinal Analysis

1.  **"Cessation and Contemplation" (止觀 - Zhǐguān):** The title establishes the core dialectic. *Zhi* (Śamatha/Stopping) is the stillness of the Dharma body; *Guan* (Vipaśyanā/Seeing) is the illumination of Prajñā. "Lucid and tranquil" (*Míngjìng* 明靜) refers to their union: Lucid = Guan, Tranquil = Zhi.
2.  **"Unheard of in previous generations" (前代未聞):** This asserts the distinctiveness of the *Great* Cessation and Contemplation (Circular/Ton) from the *Gradual* (Ci Di) and *Variable* (Bu Ding) approaches Zhiyi taught previously. It signifies the revelation of the "Perfect and Sudden" (Yuán Dùn) teaching.
3.  **"Views as Object" (見境 - Jiànjìng):** This refers to the seventh of the "Ten Objects" (Shí Jìng) of contemplation. The *Mohe Zhiguan* was intended to cover ten, but Master Zhiyi halted at the seventh (Views), leaving the final three (Arrogance, Two Vehicles, Bodhisattvahood) unexplained before his passing.
4.  **"From blue comes indigo" (從藍而青):** A classical metaphor (Xunzi) indicating that the student (blue dye) can surpass the teacher (indigo plant), or that later developments arise from but exceed their origins. Here it questions whether Zhiyi's wisdom was innate (Heaven-endowed) or learned (lineage).
