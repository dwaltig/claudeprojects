> ○中、約弘誓顯是者，前推法性、聞法等，其義已顯，為未了者更約四弘。又四諦中，多約「解」明上求下化；四弘中，多約「願」明上求下化。

> 經言：「我昔與汝等不見四真諦，是故久迴轉。」火宅如此，云何耽湎縱逸嬉戲？是故慈悲起四弘誓，拔苦與樂。如釋迦之見耕墾，似彌勒之觀毀臺，即其義也。

> ○約六即顯是者，為初心是，後心是？
> 答：如《論》焦、炷，非初不離初，非後不離後。若智信具足，聞一念即是。信故不謗，智故不懼，初後皆是。若無信，高推聖境，非己智分；若無智，起增上慢，謂己均佛，初後俱非。為此事故，須知六即，謂理即、名字即、觀行即、相似即、分真即、究竟即。此六即者，始凡終聖。始凡故，除疑怯；終聖故，除慢大。

> 1.  **理即 (Li Ji - Identity in Principle):** 一念心即如來藏理。「如」故即空，「藏」故即假，「理」故即中；三智一心中具，不可思議。
> 2.  **名字即 (Mingzi Ji - Identity in Name):** 理雖即是，日用不知，以未聞三諦，全不識佛法... 或從知識，或從經卷，聞上所說一實菩提，於名字中通達解了。
> 3.  **觀行即 (Guanxing Ji - Identity in Practice):** 若但聞名口說，如蟲食木，偶得成字... 必須心觀明了，理慧相應，所行如所言，所言如所行。
> 4.  **相似即 (Xiangsi Ji - Identity in Resemblance):** 以其逾觀逾明，逾止逾寂，如勤射隣的，名「相似觀慧」。六根清淨中說。
> 5.  **分真即 (Fenzhen Ji - Identity in Partial Truth):** 因相似觀力入銅輪位，初破無明，見佛性，開寶藏，顯真如，名「發心住」；乃至「等覺」。
> 6.  **究竟即 (Jiujing Ji - Identity in Ultimate):** 等覺一轉，入於妙覺，智光圓滿不復可增，名「菩提果」。

## 🏛️ The Architect's Translation

"**Revealing the True** continues with the **Four Vows** (*Sìhóng*) and the **Six Identities** (*Liùjí*).

**The Four Great Vows (Sìhóng Shìyuàn):**
The Four Truths mostly clarify seeking above and transforming below through 'Understanding' (*Jiě*); the Four Vows mostly clarify seeking above and transforming below through 'Resolution' (*Yuàn*).
The Sutra says: 'Because I and you did not see the Four Truths, we have revolved for a long time.' The Burning House is like this; how can one indulge in pleasure and play? Therefore, out of compassion, one gives rise to the Four Great Vows to pull out suffering and give happiness. Like Shakyamuni seeing the ploughing [and suffering of worms], or Maitreya observing the destruction of the tower.

**The Six Identities (Liùjí):**
Question: Is the 'True Mind' the initial mind or the later mind?
Answer: As the *Treatise* [speaks of] the charring of the wick (by the flame)—it is not the beginning yet not separated from the beginning; not the end yet not separated from the end. If wisdom and faith are complete, hearing 'one thought' is immediately It. Because of faith, one does not slander; because of wisdom, one does not fear. Both beginning and end are It.
*   If one lacks faith, they will push the Sage's realm high away, saying it is not their portion (Self-Abasement).
*   If one lacks wisdom, they will give rise to Overweening Pride (*Zēngshàngmàn*), saying they are equal to the Buddha.
For this reason, one must know the **Six Identities**. These six span from the beginning commoner to the final sage. Beginning with the commoner removes doubt and timidity; ending with the sage removes arrogance.

1.  **Identity in Principle (*Lǐ Jí*):** One thought-moment of the mind is the principle of the Tathāgata-garbha. 'Thus' (*Rú*) implies Emptiness; 'Store' (*Zàng*) implies Provisionality; 'Principle' (*Lǐ*) implies the Middle. The Three Wisdoms are complete in one mind; this is inconceivable.
2.  **Identity in Name (*Míngzì Jí*):** Although the principle is identical, in daily use one does not know it... Hearing from a Good Friend or scripture about the One Reality Bodhi, one understands and penetrates it through names and words.
3.  **Identity in Contemplation/Practice (*Guānxíng Jí*):** If one merely hears the names and speaks with the mouth, it is like an insect eating wood that accidentally forms a character... One must have clear mental contemplation, correspondence between principle and wisdom; actions must match words, and words must match actions.
4.  **Identity in Resemblance (*Xiàngsì Jí*):** As contemplation becomes clearer and cessation becomes more tranquil, like shooting arrows near the target, it is called 'Resemblance Wisdom.' This corresponds to the Six Sense-Organs Purification.
5.  **Identity in Partial Truth (*Fēnzhēn Jí*):** Due to the power of resemblance contemplation, one enters the Copper Wheel position, first breaking ignorance, seeing Buddha-nature, opening the treasure store, and revealing True Thusness. This is the 'Stage of Arousing the Mind' (First Abode) up to 'Equal Enlightenment.'
6.  **Identity in Ultimate (*Jiùjìng Jí*):** Equal Enlightenment turns once more and enters Marvelous Enlightenment (*Miàojué*). The light of wisdom is full and can increase no further; this is the Fruit of Bodhi. The Great Nirvana is cut off (from suffering), with nothing more to cut off; this is the Fruit of Fruit."
