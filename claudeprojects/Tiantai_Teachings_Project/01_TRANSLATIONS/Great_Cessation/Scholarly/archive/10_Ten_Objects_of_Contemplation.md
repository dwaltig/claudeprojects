"**The Ten Objects of Contemplation (*Shí Jìng*):**
The objects of Cessation and Contemplation are opened into ten:
1.  **Skandhas, Entrances, and Realms** (*Yīn Rù Jiè*)
2.  **Defilements** (*Fánnǎo*)
3.  **Sickness** (*Bìnghuàn*)
4.  **Karmic Marks** (*Yèxiàng*)
5.  **Demonic Affairs** (*Móshì*)
6.  **Dhyāna Meditation** (*Chándìng*)
7.  **Views** (*Zhūjiàn*)
8.  **Overweening Pride** (*Zēngshàngmàn*)
9.  **Two Vehicles** (*Èrchéng*)
10. **Bodhisattvahood** (*Púsà*)

These ten objects can all cover and obstruct [the Path].

**1. Skandhas, Entrances, and Realms (The Primary Object):**
Why are the Skandhas placed first? For two reasons:
1.  **Always Present:** The heavy burden of the Skandhas and Entrances is always present before the practitioner. Whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, one never departs from the Skandhas.
2.  **Scriptural Basis:** The *Great Prajna Sutra* says: 'The Śrāvaka practices the Path relying on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness (Body/Feeling/Mind/Dharma); the Bodhisattva first contemplates Form (*Rūpa*) up to All-Knowledge.'

**The Interaction of Objects:**
*   When one contemplates the Skandhas (Result), it stirs the **Defilements** (Cause). Therefore, Defilements are discussed second.
*   The Four Elements (Body) and Three Poisons (Mind) conflict, causing **Sickness**. Therefore, Sickness is third.
*   Through sickness, one perceives the **Karmic Marks** of past deeds. Therefore, Karma is fourth.
*   As good and evil karma vie, **Demons** appear to compete for control. Therefore, Demon Works are fifth.
*   If one overcomes demons, **Dhyāna** (Meditation) arises. Therefore, Dhyāna is sixth.
*   In meditation, one may give rise to deviation, producing false **Views**. Therefore, Views are seventh.
*   If one adheres to views, one gives rise to **Arrogance** (Thinking one has attained what one has not). Therefore, Arrogance is eighth.
*   If one attaches to the small peace of partial attainment, one falls into the **Two Vehicles** (Hinayana). Therefore, Two Vehicles are ninth.
*   If one attaches to the emptiness of the Bodhisattva deeds without realizing the Middle Way, one falls into the **Bodhisattva** object (The incomplete Bodhisattva). Therefore, Bodhisattva is tenth.

**Conclusion:**
The first object (Skandhas) is the 'Constant Object' (*Cháng Jìng*). The other nine are 'Occasional Objects' (*Bùdéyǐ Jìng*)—they are only contemplated if and when they arise to obstruct the practice."
