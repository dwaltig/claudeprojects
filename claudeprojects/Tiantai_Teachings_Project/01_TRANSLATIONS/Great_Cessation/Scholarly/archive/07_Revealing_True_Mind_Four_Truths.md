# Mohe Zhiguan - Fascicle 1: Revealing the True Mind (Scholarly)

## Source Text
> ○顯是更為三：初、四諦，次、四弘，後、六即。四諦名相出《大經．聖行品》，謂生滅、無生滅、無量、無作。
>
> 「生滅」者，苦集是世因果，道滅出世因果。苦則三相遷移，集則四心流動，道則對治易奪，滅則滅有還無。雖世、出世，皆是變異，故名「生滅四諦」也。
>
> 「無生」者，苦無逼迫，一切皆空，豈有空能遣空？即色是空，受想行識亦復如是，故無逼迫相也。「集無和合相」者，因果俱空，豈有因空與果空合？歷一切貪瞋癡亦復如是。道不二相，無能治所治，空尚無一，云何有二耶？法本不然，今則無滅，不然不滅，故名「無生四諦」也。
>
> 「無量」者，分別校計苦有無量相，謂一法界苦尚復若干，況十法界？則種種若干，非二乘若智若眼所能知見，乃是菩薩所能明了。謂地獄種種若干差別，鈹剝、割截、燒煮、剉切，尚復若干不可稱計，況復餘界種種色、種種受想行識，塵沙海渧寧當可盡？故非二乘知見，菩薩智眼乃能通達。
>
> 「無作四諦」者，皆是實相，不可思議，非但第一義諦無復若干，若三悉檀及一切法無復若干，此義可知，不復委記。若以四諦竪對諸土，有增有減，同居有四，方便則三，實報則二，寂光但一。

## 🏛️ The Architect's Translation

"**Revealing the True** is further divided into three parts:
1.  **The Four Truths**
2.  **The Four Vows**
3.  **The Six Identities**

**The Four Truths (Si Di):**
The names and characteristics of the Four Truths come from the *Holy Conduct Chapter* of the *Great Sutra* (Nirvana Sutra). They are:
1.  **Born and Perishing** (*Shēngmiè*)
2.  **Unborn and Imperishing** (*Wúshēngmiè*)
3.  **Immeasurable** (*Wúliàng*)
4.  **No-Function** (*Wúzuò*)

**1. Born and Perishing:**
Suffering and Accumulation are worldly cause and effect; the Path and Extinction are out-of-worldly cause and effect.
*   **Suffering:** Characterized by the migration of the three marks (birth, abiding, perishing).
*   **Accumulation:** Characterized by the flow of the four minds (craving, etc.).
*   **Path:** Characterized by counteraction and replacement (curing illness).
*   **Extinction:** Characterized by extinguishing existence and returning to nothingness.
Although they are worldly and out-of-worldly, all are changing and mutating, hence named the **Born and Perishing Four Truths** (corresponds to Tripitaka/Storehouse Teaching).

**2. Unborn (and Imperishing):**
*   **Suffering has no oppression:** All things are empty; how can emptiness expel emptiness? Form is immediately emptiness; feeling, perception, volition, and consciousness are also like this. Therefore, there is no characteristic of oppression.
*   **Accumulation has no characteristic of combination:** Cause and effect are both empty; how can an empty cause combine with an empty effect?
*   **Path has no characteristic of duality:** There is no subject to cure and no object to be cured. Emptiness does not even have 'one,' how can there be 'two'?
*   **Extinction:** Dharmas are originally not so (not arisen); now there is no extinction. Not arisen and not extinguished, hence named the **Unborn Four Truths** (corresponds to Connecting Teaching).

**3. Immeasurable:**
Distinguishing and calculating that Suffering has immeasurable characteristics. Even the suffering of one Dharma-realm is manifold; how much more so the Ten Dharma-realms? This variety is not something the wisdom or eyes of the Two Vehicles can know or see; it is what the Bodhisattva can clearly understand. From the specific sufferings of Hell (peeling, cutting, burning) to the various skandhas of other realms—numerous as dust and sand—this is the **Immeasurable Four Truths** (corresponds to Separate Teaching).

**4. No-Function (Wu Zuo):**
All are the Real Mark (*Shíxiàng*), inconceivable. Not only is the Supreme Truth devoid of plurality, but the Three Siddhantas and all dharmas are also devoid of plurality. This meaning can be known [from the implication]. This is the **No-Function Four Truths** (corresponds to Perfect Teaching).

**Vertical Alignment with Lands:**
If we align the Four Truths vertically with the [Four] Lands:
*   **Land of Co-dwelling:** Has all four (Born/Perishing, Unborn, Immeasurable, No-Function).
*   **Land of Expedient Means:** Has three (Unborn, Immeasurable, No-Function).
*   **Land of Real Retribution:** Has two (Immeasurable, No-Function).
*   **Land of Eternal Quiescence:** Has only one (No-Function)."
