## 🏛️ The Architect's Translation

"**2. Clarifying the Eye and Wisdom (*Míng Yǎn Zhì*):**
The Substance itself is neither knowing (*Zhī*) nor seeing (*Jiàn*), neither cause nor effect. Speaking of it is difficult, how much more so showing it to others? Although it cannot be known or seen, through Eye and Wisdom it can be known and seen.
*   **Zhiguan (Stop/Look)** is the Cause.
*   **Eye/Wisdom** is the Result.

**A. The Order of Eyes and Wisdoms (Relative):**
1.  **Three Stops/Looks** produce **Three Eyes/Wisdoms**.
    *   **Body of Truth Stop** + **Entering Emptiness Look** → **Wisdom Eye** (*Huìyǎn*) and **All-Knowledge** (*Yíqièzhì*). (Knowing the Empty).
    *   **Following Conditions Stop** + **Entering Provisional Look** → **Dharma Eye** (*Fǎyǎn*) and **Way-Seed Knowledge** (*Dàozhǒngzhì*). (Knowing the Particulars).
    *   **Resting Extremes Stop** + **Middle Way Look** → **Buddha Eye** (*Fóyǎn*) and **Universal All-Knowledge** (*Yíqièzhǒngzhì*). (Knowing the Middle).

**B. The Five Eyes (*Wǔyǎn*):**
The *Vajracchedikā* asks: 'Does the Tathagata have the Fleshly Eye?' Answer: 'Yes.'
1.  **Fleshly Eye (*Ròuyǎn*):** Seeing gross form (Obstacles exist).
2.  **Heavenly Eye (*Tiānyǎn*):** Seeing subtle form (Obstacles transparent).
3.  **Wisdom Eye (*Huìyǎn*):** Seeing Emptiness (Truth).
4.  **Dharma Eye (*Fǎyǎn*):** Seeing the Provisional (Medicines/diseases).
5.  **Buddha Eye (*Fóyǎn*):** Seeing the Real Reality.

In the **Perfect Teaching**, these are not five separate organs. The One Buddha Eye possesses the function of all five.
*   It sees gross form (Meat Eye).
*   It sees subtle form (Heavenly Eye).
*   It sees Truth (Wisdom Eye).
*   It sees Order (Dharma Eye).
*   It sees Reality (Buddha Eye).
Like a hundred rivers entering the ocean lose their names but retain their water; the Five Eyes merge into the Buddha Eye but retain their functions.

**3. Clarifying the Boundary/Object (*Míng Jìngjiè*):**
The Object (*Jìng*) is what the Wisdom illuminates.
1.  **Relative Truth (*Súdì*):** The Illusion/Provisional.
2.  **Absolute Truth (*Zhēndì*):** The Emptiness.
3.  **Middle Way Supreme Truth (*Zhōngdào Dìyīyì Dì*):** The Non-Dual.

**The One Truth:**
In the Perfect View, there is only **One Real Truth** (*Yī Shí Dì*).
*   Relative, Absolute, and Middle are three names for one reality.
*   Like a mirror: The brightness is Empty; the image is Provisional; the mirror body is Middle. They are inseparable.

**4. Clarifying Gain and Loss (*Míng Dé Shī*):**
Does Wisdom arise from the Mind? Or from the Object?
*   If Wisdom comes from the Mind (Self-Nature), it is arbitrary.
*   If from the Object (Other-Nature), the object is inert.
*   If from Both (Shared-Nature), it has double faults.
*   If from Neither (Causeless), it is random.

**The Solution:**
Nagarjuna says: 'Dharmas do not arise from self, other, both, or no cause.'
*   **The Loss:** Thinking wisdom is a 'thing' possessed by a 'self' that grasps an 'object.' This is the Four Attachments.
*   **The Gain:** Understanding that Wisdom and Object are **Non-Dual**. The Mind *is* the Object; the Object *is* the Mind. When the mind is pure, the object is pure.
*   **Perfect Gain:** The Perfect Teaching sees that the Teaching (Words) and the Certification (Realization) are both Inconceivable. There is no gainer and nothing to be gained. This is the true Gain."

## 📜 Doctrinal Analysis

1.  **The Five Eyes:** Zhiyi's integration of the Five Eyes is brilliant. He refuses to discard the "Fleshly Eye." The Buddha doesn't stop seeing colors and shapes; he sees them *as* the Middle Way. Enlightenment encompasses the physical, not just the spiritual.
2.  **The Three Wisdoms:**
    *   **All-Knowledge (*Sarvajñā*):** General knowledge of the universal characteristic (Emptiness). (Arhats have this).
    *   **Way-Seed Knowledge (*Mārgākārajñā*):** Specific knowledge of all distinct paths and dharmas. (Bodhisattvas have this).
    *   **Universal All-Knowledge (*Sarvākārajñā*):** Perfect knowledge of both universality and distinctness simultaneously. (Buddhas have this).
3.  **Gain and Loss:** The ultimate "Gain" is the realization of "No-Gain" (*Wúsuǒdé*). If you think you have "gained" enlightenment, that thought itself is a "loss" (an obstruction).
