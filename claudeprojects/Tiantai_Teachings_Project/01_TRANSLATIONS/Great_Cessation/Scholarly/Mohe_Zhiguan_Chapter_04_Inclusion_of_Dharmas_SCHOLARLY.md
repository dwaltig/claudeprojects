"**4. Clarifying the Inclusion of Dharmas (*Míng Shèfǎ*):**
Skeptics might say: 'The name *Zhiguan* (Cessation and Contemplation) is brief; perhaps it does not include all dharmas comprehensively.'
I say: Not so. **Zhiguan is a Dhāraṇī (Total Hold); it pervades and gathers all dharmas.**
*   **Cessation (*Zhǐ*)** silences all dharmas. Like finding the acupuncture point cures all ailments.
*   **Contemplation (*Guān*)** illuminates the Principle. Like obtaining the Dragon Pearl, one acquires all treasures.
The *Great Treatise* lists 120 doctrines, all included in Prajñā (Wisdom/Guan).
Samadhi (Zhi) includes all concentrations.

**The Six Points of Inclusion:**
We broaden the discussion to six points:
1.  **Including all Principles (*Lǐ*):** All Truths (Relative, Absolute, Middle) are the object of Zhiguan.
2.  **Including all Delusions (*Huò*):**
    *   **Breaking View/Thought (*Jiàn Sī*):** Entering Emptiness breaks the wheel of Samsara (12 Links).
    *   **Breaking Dust/Sand (*Chénshā*):** Entering the Provisional breaks the hindrance to knowledge.
    *   **Breaking Ignorance (*Wúmíng*):** Entering the Middle breaks the root source of delusion.
    The Three Stops/Looks utilize the proper medicine for all illnesses.
3.  **Including all Wisdoms (*Zhì*):** From Worldly Wisdom to Universal All-Knowledge, all are included in the Three Views.
4.  **Including all Practices (*Xíng*):**
    *   **Wisdom Practice (*Huìxíng*):** The View (Proper practice).
    *   **Action Practice (*Xíngxíng*):** The Conduct (Helper practice).
    All 37 Factors of Enlightenment, Four Dhyanas, Four Immeasurables, Eight Liberations, and Six Paramitas are included.
    *   *Examples:* The 4 Foundations of Mindfulness are Wisdom (Guan). The 4 Right Efforts are Effort (Zhi/Guan). The 5 Roots... etc.
5.  **Including all Positions (*Wèi*):**
    *   **Common/Sage:** From the Dry Wisdom stage to the 8th Ground.
    *   **Perfect:** From the 5 Products to the Stage of Equal Enlightenment.
    Zhiguan covers the entire map of the path.
6.  **Including all Teachings (*Jiào*):**
    *   **Worldly Teachings:** Even secular theories (Confucianism, Taoism, yin-yang) arise from the mind.
    *   **Out-of-Worldly Teachings:** The 12 Divisions of Scripture.
    *   **The Metaphor:** The Buddha's teaching is like a great script written in the sky. The Zhiguan practitioner copies this script into their own mind. One mind includes all teachings.

**Conclusion:**
In summary:
*   **One Principle** includes all principles, delusions, wisdoms, practices, positions, teachings.
*   **One Delusion** includes all...
*   **One Wisdom** includes all...
*   **One Practice** includes all...
*   **One Position** includes all...
*   **One Teaching** includes all...
Zhiguan is the holographic inclusion of the entire Buddhadharma."

## 📜 Doctrinal Analysis

1.  **Dhāraṇī (Zǒngchí):** Zhiguan is not a "part" of Buddhism; it is the "Total Hold." It is the operating system upon which all other apps (doctrines) run.
2.  **The Six Inclusions:** This taxonomy (Reason, Delusion, Wisdom, Practice, Position, Teaching) covers the entirety of the Buddhist experience:
    *   *Ontology* (Reason).
    *   *Pathology* (Delusion).
    *   *Epistemology* (Wisdom).
    *   *Praxis* (Practice).
    *   *Soteriology* (Position).
    *   *Pedagogy* (Teaching).
3.  **Holographic Nature:** The final section ("One Principle includes all...") is pure Tiantai metaphysics. Any single aspect of reality, when fully penetrated via Zhiguan, reveals the totality of all other aspects. This is the **"Three Thousand Realms in a Single Thought"** in embryonic form.
