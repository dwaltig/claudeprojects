## 🏛️ The Architect's Translation

"**5. Clarifying the Biased and the Perfect (*Míng Piānyuán*):**
The practitioner now knows that Zhiguan includes all dharmas. Since it includes so much, one must distinguish between the Small and Large, the Shared and Not-Shared, the Expedient and Real, the Conceivable and Inconceivable. Therefore, we simplify this into **Biased and Perfect**.
This is divided into five pairs:
1.  **Small and Large** (*Xiǎo Dà*)
2.  **Half and Full** (*Bàn Mǎn*)
3.  **Biased and Perfect** (*Piān Yuán*)
4.  **Gradual and Sudden** (*Jiàn Dùn*)
5.  **Expedient and Real** (*Quán Shí*)

**1. Small and Large (*Xiǎo Dà*):**
*   **Small (Hinayana):** Weak wisdom. Only capable of analyzing dharmas (*Xīfǎ*) to enter Emptiness. Like breaking a pillar to find emptiness. This is the **Analytic Stop/Look**. It falls into the 'Small' vehicle.
*   **Large (Mahayana):** Deep and sharp wisdom. Capable of 'Substantializing' (*Tǐfǎ*) dharmas to enter Emptiness. Knowing that form *is* empty without destruction. Like a mirror image is empty. This is the **Substantial Stop/Look**. It belongs to the 'Large' vehicle.

**2. Half and Full (*Bàn Mǎn*):**
*   **Half:** The 9 Divisions of Scripture (excluding Vaipulya/Avatamsaka/etc. in some classifications, or simply the incomplete teaching).
*   **Full:** The 12 Divisions.
(This pair reinforces the Small/Large distinction).

**3. Biased and Perfect (*Piān Yuán*):**
*   **Biased (*Piān*):** 'Biased' means one-sided. Even the 'Large' vehicle (as defined above) can be biased if it only sees the 'Empty' or the 'Separate' (Distinctive).
    *   Tripitaka (Small) is Biased.
    *   Connecting (Shared) is Biased.
    *   Separate (Distinct) is Biased (because it separates the Absolute from the Relative).
    *   *Sutra:* 'Before this, we were all people of wrong views.'
*   **Perfect (*Yuán*):** 'Perfect' means round and full.
    *   **The Perfect Teaching:** Sees One Mind, Three Truths.
    *   Following One's Own Mind (*Suízìyì*).
    *   Only this stands alone as the 'Perfect.'

**4. Gradual and Sudden (*Jiàn Dùn*):**
*   **Gradual:** Proceeding step-by-step. From shallow to deep.
    *   Tripitaka, Connecting, and Separate are all 'Gradual' (to varying degrees).
    *   Separate Teaching is 'Gradual' because it moves from Empty -> False -> Middle.
*   **Sudden:** Proceeding immediately to the Ultimate.
    *   The Perfect Teaching is 'Sudden' because the beginning *is* the end.
    *   'Honest and straightforward, discarding expedients, only expounding the Unsurpassed Way.'
    *   *Nirvana Sutra:* 'Snow Mountain grass (Kṣānti); if a cow eats it, she immediately produces Ghee (Ti-hu).' (No processing needed).

**5. Expedient and Real (*Quán Shí*):**
*   **Expedient (*Quán*):** Temporary methods. Like the 'Magic City.'
    *   The Three Vehicles (Sound Hearer, Pratyekabuddha, Bodhisattva) are Expedients.
    *   The first three teachings (Tripitaka, Connecting, Separate) are Expedients.
*   **Real (*Shí*):** The Ultimate Truth. Like the 'Treasure Place.'
    *   The One Vehicle is Real.
    *   The Perfect Teaching is Real.

**Conclusion:**
There are four kinds of Zhiguan:
1.  **Tripitaka Zhiguan:** Small, Half, Biased, Gradual, Expedient.
2.  **Connecting Zhiguan:** Large, Half/Full (Transitional), Biased, Gradual, Expedient.
3.  **Separate Zhiguan:** Large, Full, Biased, Gradual, Expedient.
4.  **Perfect Zhiguan:** Large, Full, Perfect, Sudden, Real.

We expound this *Mohe Zhiguan* to reveal the **Perfect, Sudden, Real** teaching."

## 📜 Doctrinal Analysis

1.  **The Five Pairs:** This is a comprehensive grid for evaluating any Buddhist text or practice. It prevents the practitioner from getting stuck in a "lesser" vehicle while thinking it is the ultimate.
2.  **The "Separate" as Biased:** This is Tiantai's unique critique. Even the "Separate" Teaching (Mahayana which teaches Emptiness separately from Existence) is considered "Biased" because it sets up a duality between Samsara and Nirvana. Only the "Perfect" Teaching (Samsara *is* Nirvana) is truly Non-Dual.
3.  **The "Sudden" Cow:** The metaphor of the cow eating *Kṣānti* grass and immediately producing Ghee (the final product of milk processing) illustrates the immediacy of the Perfect Teaching. In other paths, you must process the milk (practice) through many stages (cream, butter) to get Ghee (Enlightenment). In the Perfect Path, the milk *is* the Ghee.
