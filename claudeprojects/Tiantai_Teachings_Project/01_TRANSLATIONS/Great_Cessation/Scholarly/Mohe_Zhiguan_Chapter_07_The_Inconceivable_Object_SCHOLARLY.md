## 🏛️ The Architect's Translation

"**1. Contemplating the Inconceivable Object (*Guān Bùkěsīyì Jìng*):**
The *Avataṃsaka Sutra* says: 'The mind is like a skillful painter, creating various Five Skandhas; in all the worlds, there is nothing that is not created by the mind.'
The 'various Five Skandhas' refer to the **Ten Dharma Realms**.

**A. The Ten Dharma Realms (*Shí Fǎjiè*):**
1.  Hell
2.  Hungry Ghosts
3.  Animals
4.  Asuras
5.  Humans
6.  Heavens
7.  Śrāvakas (Voice-Hearers)
8.  Pratyekabuddhas
9.  Bodhisattvas
10. Buddhas

**B. The Mutual Inclusion (*Hùjù*):**
One Dharma Realm contains the other ten.
*   The Hell realm has the Buddha nature (and all others).
*   The Buddha realm has the Hell nature (and all others).
Thus, 10 x 10 = **100 Dharma Realms**.

**C. The Thirty Worlds (*Sānshí Shìjiān*):**
Each of the 100 Realms possesses three kinds of worlds:
1.  **World of Five Skandhas (*Wǔyīn Shìjiān*):** The psycho-physical form.
2.  **World of Sentient Beings (*Zhòngshēng Shìjiān*):** The living being (假名 - nominal existence).
3.  **World of Land/Environment (*Guótǔ Shìjiān*):** The place of residence (e.g., iron city for hell, lapis lazuli for heaven).
Thus, 100 x 3 = **300 Worlds**? No, wait.
Actually, each of the 100 realms has **Ten Suchnesses** (*Shí Rúshì*): Appearance, Nature, Substance, Power, Function, Causes, Conditions, Effects, Retributions, Equality.
100 Realms x 10 Suchnesses = **1,000 Factors**.
1,000 Factors x 3 Worlds (Skandha, Being, Land) = **3,000 Realms**.

**D. Three Thousand Realms in a Single Thought (*Yīniàn Sānqiān*):**
'This Three Thousand is contained in one thought-moment (*Yīniàn Xīn*). If there is no mind, that is the end of the matter. But if there is even a momentary thought (*Jiè ěr yǒuxīn*), it immediately possesses the Three Thousand.'

**E. The Non-Dual Nature:**
Do not say the mind is *before* and the dharmas are *after*. Do not say the dharmas are *before* and the mind is *after*.
*   If the mind produces the dharmas, that is Vertical (*Zòng*).
*   If the mind contains the dharmas, that is Horizontal (*Héng*).
*   Neither Vertical nor Horizontal (*Fēi Zòng Fēi Héng*).
*   It is **Inconceivable** (*Bùkěsīyì*).
Just as a single speck of dust contains the ten directions, one thought contains the Three Thousand Realms.

**F. The Method of Contemplation:**
When you look at your own mind (the Skandha of Consciousness), do not look for it inside, outside, or in between. Yet, realize it is the **Dharma Realm**. It is the total field of reality.
If you see the 'Inconceivable Boundary,' you see the Buddha."

## 📜 Doctrinal Analysis

1.  **Yīniàn Sānqiān:** This is the specific signature of Tiantai Buddhism. It rejects the idea that the mind "creates" the world (Idealism/Yogacara) in a sequential sense. Instead, the mind *is* the world. The relationship is simultaneous and mutual.
2.  **The "Evil" in the Buddha:** Because of Mutual Inclusion, the Buddha-realm contains the Hell-realm. The Buddha does not *act* on Hell-impulses (he has cut the "Function"), but he retains the "Nature" of Hell. This allows him to understand and save hell-beings. This is the **"Sex-Including Evil"** (*Xìng È*) doctrine—Evil is part of the Nature (*Xìng*), though removed from Function (*Xiū*).
3.  **The Middle Way:** The "Three Thousand" is not a chaotic mess. It is the **Middle Way**. It is Empty (no self-nature), Provisional (distinct marks of 3000), and Middle (one reality).
