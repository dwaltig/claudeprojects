"**2. Explaining the Name of Cessation and Contemplation (*Shì Zhǐguān Míng*):**
The general outline has already been discussed above. Now, by what meaning is the name 'Cessation and Contemplation' (*Zhǐguān*) established? Briefly, there are four aspects:
1.  **Relative** (*Xiāngdài*)
2.  **Absolute** (*Juédài*)
3.  **Converging Differences** (*Huìyì*)
4.  **Communicating with the Three Virtues** (*Tōng Sāndé*)

---

### 1. Relative (*Xiāngdài*)
**A. Cessation (*Zhǐ*) has three meanings:**
1.  **Stopping (*Xī*):** Resting the evil inquiries and false thoughts; silencing them into tranquility. The *Vimalakīrti Sutra* says: 'What is climbing conditions? It is conditioning the Three Realms. What is resting climbing conditions? It is the mind having nothing to attain.' This is named from the aspect of *what is broken* (*suǒpò*).
2.  **Abiding (*Tíng*):** Tying the mind to the principle of the Truth; abiding and not moving. The *Renwang Sutra* says: 'Entering the Principle Prajñā is named Abiding.' This is named from the aspect of *what is established* (*néngzhǐ*).
3.  **Stopping in contrast to Non-Stopping:** This specifically refers to the dialectic of the Essence. Ignorance is 'Non-Stopping' (flowing); the Dharma-nature is 'Stopping' (still). We call the Dharma-nature 'Stop' relative to the flow of Ignorance.

**B. Contemplation (*Guān*) has three meanings:**
1.  **Penetrating (*Guānchuān*):** The utilization of wisdom to pierce and destroy defilements. Like a sharp pickaxe digging through earth and stone to reach gold. This is named from *what is broken*.
2.  **Perceiving/Attaining (*Guāndá*):** The contemplative wisdom penetrating and reaching the True Thusness. The *Treatise* says: 'If the mind is pure and constant, one sees Prajñā.' This is named from *what is capable of contemplating* (*néngguān*).
3.  **Contemplation in contrast to Non-Contemplation:** Ignorance is 'Non-Contemplation' (Blindness); Dharma-nature is 'Contemplation' (Illumination). We call Dharma-nature 'Guan' relative to the blindness of Ignorance.

### 2. Absolute (*Juédài*)
This breaks the previous 'Relative' understanding.
*   **Horizontal Breaking:** If 'Stop' is named from 'Stopping Evil' (what is broken), it falls into *Other-Nature*. If named from 'Abiding in Truth' (what abides), it falls into *Self-Nature*. If named from both, *Shared-Nature*. If neither, *Causeless-Nature*. Since the four natures are unarisen, how can there be a 'Relative Stop'?
*   **Vertical Breaking:** The relative stops are stages (Gradual, Variable).
    *   Stopping View/Thinking is relative to Samsara.
    *   Stopping Ignorance is relative to the Two Extremes.
    These are all 'born' dharmas, capable of destruction.

**The Absolute Cessation and Contemplation:**
It cuts off all relativities (Horizontal and Vertical). It cuts off all conceivabilities.
*   All dharmas do not arise, hence named **Stop** (*Zhǐ*); but 'Stop' itself is not obtainable.
*   The Contemplation merges with the Object; the Object is quiescent, so how can there be **Contemplation** (*Guān*)?
*   There is no 'Stop' vs. 'Not-Stop'.
*   The extinction of the 'Relative' is named **Absolute Stop**.
*   The cutting of the 'Inverted Thought' is named **Absolute Look**.

This Absolute Zhiguan is the **'One Great Matter'** (*Yī Dàshì*). It does not depend on small matters. Like the Great Void does not depend on a small void. It is the unique Dharma-realm.

### 3. Converging Differences (*Huìyì*)
This Absolute Zhiguan has many names in the sutras.
*   **Synonyms for 'Stop':** Far-Away (*Yuǎnlí*), Non-Abiding (*Bùzhù*), Non-Attachment (*Bùzhuó*), Non-Action (*Wúwéi*), Quiescence (*Jìmiè*), Dhyāna (*Chándìng*), Abandoning (*Qì*).
*   **Synonyms for 'Look':** Knowledge-Vision (*Zhījiàn*), Wisdom (*Zhìhuì*), Illumination (*Zhàoliǎo*), Awareness (*Jué*).

Although the names are different, the body is one. The Three Virtues (Dharma Body, Prajñā, Liberation) are just one Dharma with different names for different beings.

### 4. Communicating with the Three Virtues (*Tōng Sāndé*)
Why do we use the specific name 'Zhiguan' to explain the Virtues? Because the *Nirvana Sutra* says: 'The Buddha and sentient beings are all placed in the Secret Store.' The **Secret Store** is the **Three Virtues**:
1.  **Dharma Body (*Fǎshēn*):** The essence. Corresponds to **Non-Stop Non-Look** (The Middle).
2.  **Prajñā (*Bōrě*):** The light. Corresponds to **Contemplation** (*Guān*).
3.  **Liberation (*Jiětuō*):** The freedom. Corresponds to **Cessation** (*Zhǐ*).

**The Interpenetration:**
*   **Zhi (Stop)** contains **Guan**. (In Liberation, there is Wisdom).
*   **Guan (Look)** contains **Zhi**. (In Wisdom, there is Liberation).
*   **Zhiguan** contains **Non-Zhi Non-Guan**. (In function, there is Essence).

The Three Virtues are not vertical (one after another), not horizontal (side by side), not one, not different. They are like the three dots of the Sanskrit letter **'I'** (伊字 - *Yī*).
*   **Not Vertical:** Because all are the Buddha-Dharma, complete in one mind.
*   **Not Horizontal:** Because they merge into one Dharma-realm.
*   **Not One:** Because they establish all distinctions.
*   **Not Different:** Because they all return to the First Principle.

**Conclusion of Chapter 2:**
The name 'Zhiguan' is not just a label for a practice; it is a direct signifier of the Ultimate Reality (The Secret Store of Three Virtues). Understanding the Name leads to understanding the Substance."

## 📜 Doctrinal Analysis

1.  **The Threefold Definition:** Zhiyi consistently uses a threefold structure: Action (Stopping evil), Stability (Abiding in truth), and Ontology (The nature of Reality vs. Illusion). This ensures 'Zhiguan' covers ethics, concentration, and wisdom.
2.  **Relative vs. Absolute:** This is the core Tiantai dialectic. 'Relative' implies duality (Light vs. Dark). 'Absolute' transcends duality. But true Absolute is not separate from the Relative; it is the *opening* of the Relative to reveal its Empty nature.
3.  **The Letter 'I' (∴):** The Sanskrit *Siddhaṃ* 'I' (three dots in a triangle) is the standard Tiantai metaphor for the **Three Truths** or **Three Virtues**. They are distinct (three dots) but inseparable (one letter). If you remove one dot, it is no longer 'I'.
