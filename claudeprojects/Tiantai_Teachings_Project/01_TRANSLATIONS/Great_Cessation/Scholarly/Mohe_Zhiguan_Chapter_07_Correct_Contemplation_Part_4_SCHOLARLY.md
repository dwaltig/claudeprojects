## 🏛️ The Architect's Translation

"**5. Knowing Passage and Blockage (*Shí Tōngsè*):**
*   **Blockage (*Sè*):** Attachment. If one breaks a view but becomes attached to the 'Breaking,' it becomes a blockage.
*   **Passage (*Tōng*):** Non-attachment. If one passes through the view and does not dwell in the 'Breaking,' it is a passage.
The wise practitioner constantly monitors the mind: 'Is this a flow or a stagnation?' If blocked, use the 'Breaking' (Mode 4). If flowing, nurture it.

**6. Cultivating the Path-Assistants (*Xiū Dàopǐn*):**
If the main practice (Zhiguan) is difficult, one tunes the mind using the **37 Factors of Enlightenment** (*Sānshíqī Dàopǐn*):
*   **Four Foundations of Mindfulness:** To stabilize the object.
*   **Four Right Efforts:** To exert energy.
*   **Four Bases of Power:** To fix the will.
*   **Five Roots/Powers:** To deepen the foundation.
*   **Seven Factors of Awakening:** To differentiate the true/false.
*   **Eightfold Path:** To walk the correct road.
The practitioner selects the factor appropriate for the moment (e.g., if dull, use 'Investigation'; if scattered, use 'Tranquility').

**7. Auxiliary Cure (*Duìzhì Zhùkāi*):**
If the Path-Assistants are not enough (due to heavy karmic obstacles), one uses specific antidotes:
*   **Six Paramitas:** Using Charity to cure Greed, Precepts to cure Immorality, etc.
*   **Recitation/Worship:** Using ritual to break heavy obscurations.

**8. Knowing the Stage and Position (*Zhī Cìwèi*):**
One must know where one stands to avoid the 'Thief of Arrogance.'
*   **Visualizing the Map:** Knowing the difference between the 'Five Products' (Beginner), 'Six Roots' (Similitude), and 'True Entry' (Realization).
*   *Warning:* Do not claim to be a Sage when you are a commoner.

**9. Capable of Peace and Patience (*Néng Ānrěn*):**
The path is filled with obstacles (internal/external). One must wear the 'Armor of Patience.'
*   **External:** Abuse, slander, beating.
*   **Internal:** Pain, fear, doubt.
*   **Method:** View these obstacles as empty and dream-like. Do not be moved.

**10. No Dharma Love (*Wú Fǎ Ài*):**
This is the final barrier. When the practitioner approaches the Truth, a great 'Law Love' (*Fǎ Ài*) arises—a subtle attachment to the purity and joy of the practice.
*   **The Danger:** If one loves this state, one enters the 'Top-Stuck' (*Dǐng Duò*)—stuck at the peak of the provisional, unable to enter the True.
*   **The Cure:** Smash the Love. Move past the joy. Enter the **Great Silence**."

## 📜 Doctrinal Analysis

1.  **Passage and Blockage:** This is the feedback loop of meditation. It is not enough to just "meditate"; one must constantly evaluate the *quality* of the meditation.
2.  **Dao-Pin (37 Factors):** Zhiyi integrates the classic Hinayana list of 37 factors into the Mahayana path, treating them as "functional adjustments" for the mind rather than just doctrinal categories.
3.  **No Dharma Love:** This is critical. The greatest enemy of Enlightenment is not evil; it is the *attachment to Good*. The "Similitude Stage" (resembling enlightenment) is the most dangerous place because it feels like the goal. One must step off the 100-foot pole.
