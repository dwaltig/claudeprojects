## 🏛️ The Architect's Translation

"**The Application of the Ten Vehicles to the Remaining Objects:**
Having mastered the Ten Vehicles on the **Constant Object** (The Skandhas/Mind), the practitioner may encounter specific obstructions. If so, one shifts the focus to these **Occasional Objects**.

**2. Contemplating Defilements (*Guān Fánnǎo*):**
*   **The Object:** Heavy Greed, Anger, or Stupidity arising during meditation.
*   **The Method:** View the defilement itself as the **Inconceivable Object**. 'Greed is the Way.' 'Anger is the Dharma-realm.' Do not suppress it; look into its source.

**3. Contemplating Sickness (*Guān Bìnghuàn*):**
*   **The Object:** Physical illness (caused by Elements, Karma, or Demons).
*   **The Method:** Use the pain as the object. 'Who is sick?' 'Where is the pain?' Or use the **Six Breathings** (*Liù Qì*) to cure the body.

**4. Contemplating Karmic Marks (*Guān Yèxiàng*):**
*   **The Object:** Visions of past good/evil deeds (e.g., seeing a head severed, or seeing a throne).
*   **The Method:** Recognize them as 'Dream-Illusion.' Use them to deepen the understanding of Cause and Effect, but do not fear or love them.

**5. Contemplating Demonic Affairs (*Guān Móshì*):**
*   **The Object:** Terrifying visions or blissful inducements (The Soft and Hard Thieves).
*   **The Method:** 'The Demon-Realm is the Buddha-Realm.' Do not fight; do not follow. Just Look.

**6. Contemplating Dhyāna (*Guān Chándìng*):**
*   **The Object:** Deep absorption, bliss, special powers.
*   **The Method:** Do not taste the flavor (*Wèi*) of Dhyana. View the Dhyana as Empty and Provisional. Use it to fly to the Truth, not to rest in the sky.

**7. Contemplating Views (*Guān Zhūjiàn*):**
*   **The Object:** Intellectual insights, theories, 'I have attained emptiness.'
*   **The Method:** Use the Four Gates to break the view. 'Does this view come from Self, Other, Both, or Causeless?'

**Conclusion:**
Whether the object is internal (Mind) or external (Demons), pleasant (Dhyana) or painful (Sickness), the method is always the same: **The Ten Vehicles.**
1.  See it as Inconceivable.
2.  Arouse Compassion.
3.  Skillfully Rest.
4.  Break the Attachment.
...
10. Do not Love it."

## 📜 Doctrinal Analysis

1.  **"Greed is the Way" (*Tānyù Jí Dào*):** This radical statement from the *Vimalakīrti Sutra* is the cornerstone of Tiantai practice regarding defilements. It means the energy of greed, when seen in its empty/middle nature, is identical to the energy of Enlightenment.
2.  **The Six Breathings:** Zhiyi provides a very specific medical qigong system (Blow, Call, Hee, Ho, Shoo, Si) to cure organ illnesses.
3.  **The Demon-Realm:** The non-dual view of Demons prevents paranoia. By seeing the Demon as Empty, the Demon loses its power to obstruct.
