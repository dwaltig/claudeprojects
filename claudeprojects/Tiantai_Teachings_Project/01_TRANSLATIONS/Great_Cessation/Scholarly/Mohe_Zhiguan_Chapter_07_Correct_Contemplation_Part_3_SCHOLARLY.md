## 🏛️ The Architect's Translation

"**4. Breaking Dharmas Universally (*Míng Pòfǎ Piàn*):**
The Dharma-nature (*Fǎxìng*) is inherently pure; it neither combines nor scatters. The path of language is cut off; the place of mental activity is extinguished. It is neither broken nor unbroken. Why then do we speak of 'breaking'? Because sentient beings have much inversion and little non-inversion. We break the inversion to reveal the non-inversion. Thus, we say 'Breaking Dharmas Universally.'

**A. The Method of Breaking (The Four Gates):**
To break attachment, one must enter through a 'Gate.' There are four primary gates used in the Perfect Teaching:
1.  **The Gate of Existence (*Yǒu Mén*):** Seeing that ignorance *is* enlightenment.
2.  **The Gate of Emptiness (*Kōng Mén*):** Seeing that both ignorance and enlightenment are empty.
3.  **The Gate of Both (*Yì Yǒu Yì Wú*):** Seeing the provisional existence of both.
4.  **The Gate of Neither (*Fēi Yǒu Fēi Wú*):** Seeing the Middle Way beyond duality.

**B. The Tetralemma (*Catuṣkoṭi*):**
We apply the 'Four Phrase' analysis (*Sì Jù*) to every attachment. For example, if one is attached to the idea that 'Wisdom arises from the Mind':
1.  Does it arise from **Self** (The Mind itself)? (If so, it would always be wise).
2.  Does it arise from **Other** (The Object)? (If so, the object would be wise without the mind).
3.  Does it arise from **Both**? (Double faults).
4.  Does it arise from **No Cause**? (Randomness is impossible).
Since it cannot be found in these four, the attachment is 'Broken.'

**C. Vertical and Horizontal Breaking:**
*   **Vertical Breaking (*Shù Pò*):** Deconstructing the levels of attainment. One breaks the attachment to the Human/Heavenly vehicle, then the Hinayana, then the lower Mahayana stages, until one reaches the Ultimate.
*   **Horizontal Breaking (*Héng Pò*):** Deconstructing the variety of concepts. One breaks the attachment to 'Existence,' then to 'Emptiness,' then to 'Both,' then to 'Neither.'

**D. Breaking the 'Good' Dharmas:**
It is easy to see why we break evil (Greed, Anger). But we must also break the attachment to *Good*. If one is attached to Dhyana, to Wisdom, or even to Nirvana, this attachment becomes a 'Thorn in the Flesh.' The Diamond Wisdom must grind it all to dust.
'If you see the Buddha, kill the Buddha.' (Meaning: Kill the *attachment* to the concept of Buddha)."

## 📜 Doctrinal Analysis

1.  **Universal Breaking:** This is the apophatic (negative) side of Tiantai. While we affirm the "Inconceivable Object" (Cataphatic/Positive), we must ruthlessly negate any *concept* we form about it.
2.  **The Tetralemma:** This is the standard Madhyamaka tool. Zhiyi uses it not just to prove emptiness, but to clear the ground for the "Middle Way."
3.  **Breaking the Raft:** The raft is useful for crossing the river, but if you carry it on your back after crossing, it becomes a burden. "Breaking Dharmas" means letting go of the raft *while* still crossing (non-attachment in action).
