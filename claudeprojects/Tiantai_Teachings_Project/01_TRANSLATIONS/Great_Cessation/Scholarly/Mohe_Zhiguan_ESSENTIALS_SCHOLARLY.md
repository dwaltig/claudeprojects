> 止觀明靜，前代未聞。智者，大隋開皇十四年四月二十六日，於荊州玉泉寺，一夏敷揚、二時慈霔，雖樂說不窮，纔至「見境」，法輪停轉，後分弗宣。然挹流尋源，聞香討根。論曰：「我行無師保。」經云：「受莂於定光。」書言：「生知者上，學而次良。」法門浩妙，為天真獨朗？為從藍而青？行人若聞《付法藏》，則識宗元。

## 🏛️ The Architect's Translation

"Cessation and Contemplation (*Zhǐguān*) are lucid and tranquil; in previous generations, they were unheard of. The Wise One (*Zhìzhě*), on the twenty-sixth day of the fourth month in the fourteenth year of the Kāihuáng era of the Great Suí (594 CE), at Yùquán Monastery in Jīngzhōu, spread and extolled [the teaching] for a whole summer, [and continued] the compassionate rain for two seasons. Although his joy in speaking was inexhaustible, he only reached the 'Views as Object' (*Jiànjìng*). The Wheel of Dharma stopped turning, and the latter portions were never proclaimed.

However, if one ladles from the stream to seek the source, or follows the scent to search for the root [one finds the lineage]. The *Treatise* states: 'I walk without a teacher or protector.' The *Sutra* says: '[He] received the prediction from Dīpaṃkara.' The *Book* [of History] remarks: 'Those born with knowledge are superior; those who learn it are next.' The Dharma-gate is vast and subtle; is it a solitary brightness of Heaven-endowed truth? Or is it like the blue derived from the indigo plant? If the practitioner hears the *Account of the Transmission of the Dharma Treasury* (*Fù Fǎzàng*), they will recognize the lineage and origin."

## Doctrinal Analysis

1.  **"Cessation and Contemplation" (止觀 - Zhǐguān):** The title establishes the core dialectic. *Zhi* (Śamatha/Stopping) is the stillness of the Dharma body; *Guan* (Vipaśyanā/Seeing) is the illumination of Prajñā. "Lucid and tranquil" (*Míngjìng* 明靜) refers to their union: Lucid = Guan, Tranquil = Zhi.
2.  **"Unheard of in previous generations" (前代未聞):** This asserts the distinctiveness of the *Great* Cessation and Contemplation (Circular/Ton) from the *Gradual* (Ci Di) and *Variable* (Bu Ding) approaches Zhiyi taught previously. It signifies the revelation of the "Perfect and Sudden" (Yuán Dùn) teaching.
3.  **"Views as Object" (見境 - Jiànjìng):** This refers to the seventh of the "Ten Objects" (Shí Jìng) of contemplation. The *Mohe Zhiguan* was intended to cover ten, but Master Zhiyi halted at the seventh (Views), leaving the final three (Arrogance, Two Vehicles, Bodhisattvahood) unexplained before his passing.
4.  **"From blue comes indigo" (從藍而青):** A classical metaphor (Xunzi) indicating that the student (blue dye) can surpass the teacher (indigo plant), or that later developments arise from but exceed their origins. Here it questions whether Zhiyi's wisdom was innate (Heaven-endowed) or learned (lineage).

"The Greatly Awakened World-Honored One, having fulfilled the practices over accumulated kalpas, spent six years subduing [wrong] views and raised one finger to quell Mara. Beginning at the Deer Park, continuing at Vulture Peak, and ending at the Crane Grove, He entrusted the Dharma to **Mahākāśyapa**.

Kāśyapa divided the relics into eight portions, compiled the Tripiṭaka, and entrusted the Dharma to **Ānanda**.

Ānanda, entering the Wind Samādhi in the middle of the Ganges River, divided his body into four parts and entrusted the Dharma to **Śāṇavāsa**.

Śāṇavāsa [manifested] two sweet dews from his hands and revealed five hundred Dharma-gates, trusting the Dharma to **Upagupta**.

Upagupta attained the third fruit while a layman, and upon receiving the precepts attained the fourth fruit; he entrusted the Dharma to **Dhṛṭaka**.

Dhṛṭaka attained the first fruit upon ascending the altar, and the fourth fruit after the three karmavācanā (formal announcements); he entrusted the Dharma to **Miccaka**.

Miccaka entrusted to **Buddhanandi**.

Buddhanandi entrusted to **Buddhamitra**.

Buddhamitra conferred the Three Refuges upon the King, subdued a fortune-teller, and entrusted the Dharma to **Pārśva** (The Rib Bhikshu).

Pārśva was born with white hair and emitted light from his hands to retrieve sutras; he entrusted the Dharma to **PuṇyaYaśas**.

PuṇyaYaśas defeated **Aśvaghoṣa** in debate, shaving his head to make him a disciple. Aśvaghoṣa composed the *Rāṣṭrapāla Opera*; the sounds of the music expounded impermanence, suffering, and emptiness, causing those who heard it to awaken to the Way. He entrusted the Dharma to **Kapimala** (Bhikshu).

Kapimala composed the *Theory of No-Self*; wherever the treatise was directed, evil views were extinguished. He entrusted the Dharma to **Nāgārjuna**.

Nāgārjuna [obtained] a physical body from a tree and achieved the Dharma-body from a Dragon (Nāga); he entrusted the Dharma to **Kāṇadeva**.

Kāṇadeva gouged out a golden eye [from an idol] and donated ten thousand fleshly eyes [to the sick]; he entrusted the Dharma to **Rāhulata**.

Rāhulata understood the scripts of ghosts and names, subdued heretics, and entrusted the Dharma to **Saṅghanandi**.

Saṅghanandi spoke verses to test an Arhat and entrusted the Dharma to **Saṅghayaśas**.

Saṅghayaśas traveled the ocean, saw a city, spoke verses, and entrusted the Dharma to **Kumārata**.

Kumārata saw ten thousand horsemen and recorded the horses' colors, the riders' names, and distinguished their clothing; he entrusted the Dharma to **Jayata**.

Jayata created a fire pit for a man who had committed a grave offense, ordering him to enter it to repent; the pit became a pool, and the sin was extinguished. He entrusted the Dharma to **Vasubandhu**.

Vasubandhu entrusted to **Manorhita**.

Manorhita divided the Ganges River into two, transforming himself into one part, and entrusted the Dharma to **Haklenayaśas**.

Haklenayaśas entrusted to **Simha** (The Lion Bhikshu).

Simha was harmed by King Dammira; when the sword cut him, milk flowed [instead of blood].

**Summary of the Lineage:**
The transmitters of the Dharma Treasury begin with Kāśyapa and end with Simha, totaling twenty-three persons. If **Madhyāntika**, who received it at the same time as Śāṇavāsa, is included, then there are twenty-four. All these masters were predicted by the Golden Mouth [of the Buddha]; all were sages capable of great benefit.

In the past, a King would not establish a stable at a temple, but would establish it at a slaughterhouse [to save the animals? Or implying temples are too sacred?]. How much more so, in a good age, meeting a sage—how could there be no benefit? Furthermore, there was a Brahmin selling skulls; he checked if the holes [ears to ear] were passable, half-passable, or blocked. For the passable ones, he erected stupas and made offerings, attaining birth in heaven. If the merit of merely hearing the essence of Dharma [physically passing through the skull] is like this, it was for this benefit that the Buddha entrusted the Dharma Treasury."

## 🏛️ The Architect's Translation

"Tiantai transmitted three kinds of Cessation and Contemplation from Nanyue [Huisi]: 1. **Gradual** (*Jiàncì*), 2. **Variable** (*Bùdìng*), 3. **Perfect/Sudden** (*Yuándùn*). All are Mahayana, all take the Real Mark (*Shíxiàng*) as their object, and all share the name Cessation and Contemplation.

*   **Gradual:** The beginning is shallow and the later stages are deep, like climbing a staircase.
*   **Variable:** The former and later stages alternate [without fixed order], like a diamond gem placed in the sun [reflecting differently].
*   **Perfect/Sudden:** The beginning and the end are not two, like a person with spiritual powers soaring into the sky.

These three Dharma-gates were spoken for three capacities, citing three metaphors. Having spoken briefly, [I will now] speak more broadly.

**1. The Gradual:**
Initially, one also knows the Real Mark, but the Real Mark is difficult to understand, whereas the gradual sequence is easy to practice.
*   First, one cultivates the Refuges and Precepts, turning from evil toward the upright, stopping the fire [of anger] and the blood-knife [of killing], attaining the Three Good Paths (human/heavenly).
*   Next, one cultivates Dhyāna meditation, stopping desire and the net of scattering, attaining the paths of Form and Formless meditations.
*   Next, one cultivates the Outflow-free (Anāsrava), stopping the prison of the Three Realms, attaining the path of Nirvāṇa.
*   Next, one cultivates Compassion, stopping at self-realization, attaining the Bodhisattva Path.
*   Finally, one cultivates the Real Mark, stopping the bias of the Two Extremes (Existence/Emptiness), attaining the Path of Constant Abiding.
This is the characteristic of the Gradual Cessation and Contemplation: shallow at first, deep at the end.

**2. The Variable:**
There are no distinct stages; relating the previous 'Gradual' to the subsequent 'Sudden,' they alternate before and after, mutually shallow and deep. Sometimes it is phenomenon (*Shì*), sometimes principle (*Lǐ*). Sometimes the 'Worldly' [Siddhanta] is pointed to as the 'Supreme Truth'; sometimes the 'Supreme Truth' is pointed to as 'For the Individual' or 'Counteractive.' Sometimes resting the contemplation is 'Stopping' (*Zhi*); sometimes illuminating the stopping is 'Contemplation' (*Guan*). Therefore, it is named Variable Cessation and Contemplation.

**3. The Perfect/Sudden:**
From the very beginning, one takes the Real Mark as the object. Whatever境 (object/mental state) is created is immediately the Middle Way; nothing is not True Reality. One binds one's conditions to the Dharma-realm; one thought is the Dharma-realm. One color, one fragrance—nothing is not the Middle Way. The self-realm, the Buddha-realm, and the realm of sentient beings are also like this.

The Skandhas and Entrances (Ayatanas) are all Thusness (*Rú*); there is no Suffering to be abandoned. Ignorance and dust-labors are immediately Bodhi; there is no Accumulation to be cut off. The extreme and the crooked are all the Middle-Upright; there is no Path to be cultivated. Samsara is immediately Nirvāṇa; there is no Extinction to be realized. Because there is no Suffering or Accumulation, there is no Worldly [Cause and Effect]; because there is no Path or Extinction, there is no Out-of-Worldly [Cause and Effect]. It is purely the single Real Mark; outside the Real Mark, there are no other dharmas.

The Dharma-nature remaining quiescent is named 'Stopping' (*Zhi*); quiescent yet constantly shining is named 'Contemplation' (*Guan*). Although we speak of beginning and end, there is no duality and no distinction. This is named the **Perfect and Sudden Cessation and Contemplation**."

"Now, the chapters shall be opened into ten:
1.  **Grand Purpose** (*Dàyì* 大意)
2.  **Explaining the Name** (*Shìmíng* 釋名)
3.  **Characteristics of the Substance** (*Tǐxiāng* 體相)
4.  **Inclusion of Dharmas** (*Shèfǎ* 攝法)
5.  **Biased and Perfect** (*Piānyuán* 偏圓)
6.  **Preparatory Expedients** (*Fāngbiàn* 方便)
7.  **Correct Contemplation** (*Zhèngguān* 正觀)
8.  **Retributive Effects** (*Guǒbào* 果報)
9.  **Arising of Teachings** (*Qǐjiào* 起教)
10. **The Ultimate Goal** (*Zhǐguī* 旨歸)

Ten is a number indicating completeness; it is neither too many nor too few. The beginning sets the goal at the ultimate peak (*Chá* 茶), and the end returns the lineage to the absolute limit. A good beginning and a successful end are all contained within these ten chapters.

**The Sequential Arising (Saṃutpāda):**
The sequence focuses on the 'Order' (*Cìdì*) of the ten chapters. Although the Ultimate Principle is quiescent and extinguished—where there is no birth and no arising—due to causes and conditions, the ten chapters are presented through sequential arising. Specifically, the preceding chapter gives rise to (*Shēng*) the subsequent chapter, which emerges (*Qǐ*). The reasons and the sequence of approach are as follows:

1.  **Grand Purpose:** Because for immeasurable eons we have been covered by ignorance and delusion, not knowing that ignorance *is* illumination, we now open and awaken this understanding.
2.  **Explaining the Name:** Once one knows that ignorance is illumination and no longer drifts [in samsara], this is named **'Stopping'** (*Zhi*); being lucid and greatly pure, it is called **'Looking'** (*Guan*).
3.  **Substance:** Once the name is heard, the substance is obtained.
4.  **Inclusion:** The substance includes all dharmas.
5.  **Biased/Perfect:** These are categorized into the biased and the perfect.
6.  **Expedients:** Based on the understanding of the perfect, one initiates the preparatory expedients.
7.  **Correct Contemplation:** Once the expedients are established, the Correct Contemplation is perfected.
8.  **Retributive Effects:** Having perfected the Correct Contemplation, one obtains marvelous retributive effects.
9.  **Arising of Teachings:** From one's own attainment of the Dharma, one initiates teachings to instruct others.
10. **Ultimate Goal:** Both self and other are established in peace, returning together to the Constant Quiescence."

"**The Exegesis:** This explains the ten chapters. First, we explain the **Grand Purpose** (*Dàyì*). It encompasses the beginning and the end, crowning both the initial [stage] and the final [realization]. The meaning is broad and difficult to see; now we summarize it into five [objectives]:

1.  **Arousing the Great Mind** (*Fā Dàxīn*)
2.  **Cultivating the Great Practice** (*Xiū Dàxíng*)
3.  **Feeling the Great Fruit** (*Gǎn Dàguǒ*)
4.  **Rending the Great Net** (*Liè Dàwǎng*)
5.  **Returning to the Great Abode** (*Guī Dàchù*)

**1. Arousing the Great Mind:**
Sentient beings are confused and inverted, unaware and unknowing. [We] encourage them to awaken, seeking [Bodhi] above and transforming [beings] below.

**2. Cultivating the Great Practice:**
Although one has aroused the mind, if one looks at the road but does not move, there will never be a time of arrival. [We] encourage firm and strong diligence in practicing the **Four Kinds of Samadhi**.

**3. Feeling the Great Fruit:**
Although one does not seek the Brahma [Heaven], the Brahma Heaven responds of itself. We praise the marvelous retribution to comfort and gladden the mind.

**4. Rending the Great Net:**
Various sutras and treatises open people's eyes, but they grasp this and doubt that, affirming one and denying the many. Hearing of 'snow,' they say it is cold; hearing of a 'crane,' they say it moves [mistaking the description for the reality]. Now, we fuse and penetrate the sutras and treatises, untying the knots and releasing [birds] from the cage.

**5. Returning to the Great Abode:**
The Dharma has no beginning and no end; the Dharma has no blockage and no passage. If one knows the Dharma-realm, the Dharma-realm has no beginning or end, no blockage or passage. It is expansive and greatly clear, unobstructed and self-existent (*Zìzài*)."

"**Arousing the Mind (Bodhicitta)** is further divided into three parts:
1.  **Dialect/Definition** (*Fāngyán*)
2.  **Rejecting the False** (*Jiǎnfēi*)
3.  **Revealing the True** (*Xiǎnshì*)

**1. Dialect:**
'Bodhi' (*Pútí*) is the sound of India (*Tiānzhú*); in this region, it is called the 'Way' (*Dào*).
'Citta' (*Zhìduō*) is the sound of India; in this region, it means 'Mind' (*Xīn*), specifically the mind of cognitive deliberation (*Lǜzhī*).
India also has the term *Hṛdaya* (*Wūlìtuó*), which refers to the 'heart' of grass and trees (physical core).
It also has the term *Hṛdaya* (*Yǐlìtuó*), which refers to the 'heart' as the accumulation of essential essence (physical organ).
Now, in **Rejecting the False**, we reject the physical/vegetative hearts and focus exclusively on the **Cognitive Mind** (*Lǜzhī Xīn*). The 'Way' also has general and specific meanings; now we reject [the specific false ways], summarizing them into ten.

**2. Rejecting the False (The Ten Minds):**

1.  **Hellish Mind:** If the mind, thought after thought, is exclusively devoted to greed, anger, and ignorance—unable to be restrained or pulled out, increasing daily and monthly—arising in the Upper Grade of the Ten Evils (like the five *Caṇḍālas*), this is arousing the **Hell Mind**, walking the Way of Fire.
2.  **Animal Mind:** If the mind, thought after thought, desires many followers—like the ocean swallowing streams or fire burning wood—arising in the Middle Grade of the Ten Evils (like Devadatta seducing the multitude), this is arousing the **Animal Mind**, walking the Way of Blood.
3.  **Ghostly Mind:** If the mind, thought after thought, desires fame and reputation, to be praised and sung in the four distances and eight directions, inwardly lacking real virtue but falsely comparing oneself to sages—arising in the Lower Grade of the Ten Evils (like Māgaṇḍika), this is arousing the **Ghost Mind**, walking the Way of Knives.
4.  **Asura Mind:** If the mind, thought after thought, constantly desires to surpass others, cannot endure being below anyone, belittling others and cherishing oneself—like a hawk flying high and looking down—while outwardly displaying benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and faith (the Five Virtues), arising in the Lower Grade of Goodness, this is walking the **Asura Way**.
5.  **Human Mind:** If the mind, thought after thought, delights in worldly happiness, securing this stinking body and pleasing this deluded mind, this is arising in the Middle Grade of Goodness, walking the **Human Way**.
6.  **Heavenly Mind:** If the mind, thought after thought, knows the suffering of the Three Evil Paths, sees the mixture of pain and pleasure among humans, and seeks the pure pleasure of Heaven—closing the six senses so the six dusts do not enter—this is the Upper Grade of Goodness, walking the **Heavenly Way**.
7.  **Mara Mind (Demon):** If the mind, thought after thought, desires great power and authority, so that whatever one does with body, mouth, or mind, all obey and submit, this is arousing the **Lord of Desire Mind**, walking the Way of Mara.
8.  **Nirgrantha Mind (Heretic):** If the mind, thought after thought, desires sharp wisdom and debating intelligence, to be talented and brilliant, penetrating the universe so the ten directions gaze up in awe, this is arousing the **Worldly Wisdom Mind**, walking the Way of Nirgranthas.
9.  **Brahma Mind (Form/Formless):** If the mind, thought after thought, sees the five dusts and six desires as gross external pleasures, and sees the pleasure of the Third Dhyana (like a spring in a rock) as heavy internal pleasure, this is arousing the **Brahma Mind**, walking the Way of Form and Formless Realms.
10. **Two Vehicle Mind:** If the mind, thought after thought, knows the cycle of good and evil, where commoners indulge and sages rebuke; knowing that breaking evil comes from Pure Wisdom, Pure Wisdom from Pure Dhyana, and Pure Dhyana from Pure Precepts; valuing these three laws like a hungry man values food and drink—this is arousing the **Outflow-free Mind**, walking the Way of the Two Vehicles.

**Conclusion of Rejection:**
Whether it is the Mind or the Way, the false ones are very many; we summarize them into ten. We reject them because they are not the True Bodhicitta."

The names and characteristics of the Four Truths come from the *Holy Conduct Chapter* of the *Great Sutra* (Nirvana Sutra). They are:
1.  **Born and Perishing** (*Shēngmiè*)
2.  **Unborn and Imperishing** (*Wúshēngmiè*)
3.  **Immeasurable** (*Wúliàng*)
4.  **No-Function** (*Wúzuò*)

**1. Born and Perishing:**
Suffering and Accumulation are worldly cause and effect; the Path and Extinction are out-of-worldly cause and effect.
*   **Suffering:** Characterized by the migration of the three marks (birth, abiding, perishing).
*   **Accumulation:** Characterized by the flow of the four minds (craving, etc.).
*   **Path:** Characterized by counteraction and replacement (curing illness).
*   **Extinction:** Characterized by extinguishing existence and returning to nothingness.
Although they are worldly and out-of-worldly, all are changing and mutating, hence named the **Born and Perishing Four Truths** (corresponds to Tripitaka/Storehouse Teaching).

**2. Unborn (and Imperishing):**
*   **Suffering has no oppression:** All things are empty; how can emptiness expel emptiness? Form is immediately emptiness; feeling, perception, volition, and consciousness are also like this. Therefore, there is no characteristic of oppression.
*   **Accumulation has no characteristic of combination:** Cause and effect are both empty; how can an empty cause combine with an empty effect?
*   **Path has no characteristic of duality:** There is no subject to cure and no object to be cured. Emptiness does not even have 'one,' how can there be 'two'?
*   **Extinction:** Dharmas are originally not so (not arisen); now there is no extinction. Not arisen and not extinguished, hence named the **Unborn Four Truths** (corresponds to Connecting Teaching).

**3. Immeasurable:**
Distinguishing and calculating that Suffering has immeasurable characteristics. Even the suffering of one Dharma-realm is manifold; how much more so the Ten Dharma-realms? This variety is not something the wisdom or eyes of the Two Vehicles can know or see; it is what the Bodhisattva can clearly understand. From the specific sufferings of Hell (peeling, cutting, burning) to the various skandhas of other realms—numerous as dust and sand—this is the **Immeasurable Four Truths** (corresponds to Separate Teaching).

**4. No-Function (Wu Zuo):**
All are the Real Mark (*Shíxiàng*), inconceivable. Not only is the Supreme Truth devoid of plurality, but the Three Siddhantas and all dharmas are also devoid of plurality. This meaning can be known [from the implication]. This is the **No-Function Four Truths** (corresponds to Perfect Teaching).

**Vertical Alignment with Lands:**
If we align the Four Truths vertically with the [Four] Lands:
*   **Land of Co-dwelling:** Has all four (Born/Perishing, Unborn, Immeasurable, No-Function).
*   **Land of Expedient Means:** Has three (Unborn, Immeasurable, No-Function).
*   **Land of Real Retribution:** Has two (Immeasurable, No-Function).
*   **Land of Eternal Quiescence:** Has only one (No-Function)."

## 🏛️ The Architect's Translation

"**Revealing the True** continues with the **Four Vows** (*Sìhóng*) and the **Six Identities** (*Liùjí*).

**The Four Great Vows (Sìhóng Shìyuàn):**
The Four Truths mostly clarify seeking above and transforming below through 'Understanding' (*Jiě*); the Four Vows mostly clarify seeking above and transforming below through 'Resolution' (*Yuàn*).
The Sutra says: 'Because I and you did not see the Four Truths, we have revolved for a long time.' The Burning House is like this; how can one indulge in pleasure and play? Therefore, out of compassion, one gives rise to the Four Great Vows to pull out suffering and give happiness. Like Shakyamuni seeing the ploughing [and suffering of worms], or Maitreya observing the destruction of the tower.

**The Six Identities (Liùjí):**
Question: Is the 'True Mind' the initial mind or the later mind?
Answer: As the *Treatise* [speaks of] the charring of the wick (by the flame)—it is not the beginning yet not separated from the beginning; not the end yet not separated from the end. If wisdom and faith are complete, hearing 'one thought' is immediately It. Because of faith, one does not slander; because of wisdom, one does not fear. Both beginning and end are It.
*   If one lacks faith, they will push the Sage's realm high away, saying it is not their portion (Self-Abasement).
*   If one lacks wisdom, they will give rise to Overweening Pride (*Zēngshàngmàn*), saying they are equal to the Buddha.
For this reason, one must know the **Six Identities**. These six span from the beginning commoner to the final sage. Beginning with the commoner removes doubt and timidity; ending with the sage removes arrogance.

1.  **Identity in Principle (*Lǐ Jí*):** One thought-moment of the mind is the principle of the Tathāgata-garbha. 'Thus' (*Rú*) implies Emptiness; 'Store' (*Zàng*) implies Provisionality; 'Principle' (*Lǐ*) implies the Middle. The Three Wisdoms are complete in one mind; this is inconceivable.
2.  **Identity in Name (*Míngzì Jí*):** Although the principle is identical, in daily use one does not know it... Hearing from a Good Friend or scripture about the One Reality Bodhi, one understands and penetrates it through names and words.
3.  **Identity in Contemplation/Practice (*Guānxíng Jí*):** If one merely hears the names and speaks with the mouth, it is like an insect eating wood that accidentally forms a character... One must have clear mental contemplation, correspondence between principle and wisdom; actions must match words, and words must match actions.
4.  **Identity in Resemblance (*Xiàngsì Jí*):** As contemplation becomes clearer and cessation becomes more tranquil, like shooting arrows near the target, it is called 'Resemblance Wisdom.' This corresponds to the Six Sense-Organs Purification.
5.  **Identity in Partial Truth (*Fēnzhēn Jí*):** Due to the power of resemblance contemplation, one enters the Copper Wheel position, first breaking ignorance, seeing Buddha-nature, opening the treasure store, and revealing True Thusness. This is the 'Stage of Arousing the Mind' (First Abode) up to 'Equal Enlightenment.'
6.  **Identity in Ultimate (*Jiùjìng Jí*):** Equal Enlightenment turns once more and enters Marvelous Enlightenment (*Miàojué*). The light of wisdom is full and can increase no further; this is the Fruit of Bodhi. The Great Nirvana is cut off (from suffering), with nothing more to cut off; this is the Fruit of Fruit."

"**2. Encouraging the Great Practice (*Quànjìn Dàxíng*) to Enter the Bodhisattva Position.**
Explaining this Cessation and Contemplation: If one desires to ascend to the marvelous position, without practice one cannot scale [the heights]. By skillfully understanding the churning and shaking [of the milk], one can obtain ghee (*tíhú*). The *Lotus Sutra* says: 'Again, I see the Buddha's sons cultivating various practices to seek the Buddha-Way.' Although the methods of practice are numerous, we briefly discuss four:
1.  **Constant Sitting** (*Chángzuò*)
2.  **Constant Walking** (*Chángxíng*)
3.  **Part-Walking Part-Sitting** (*Bànxíng Bànzuò*)
4.  **Neither-Walking Nor-Sitting** (*Fēixíng Fēizuò*)

Generally, they are called **'Samadhi'** (*Sānmèi*), which means 'Rectifying and Establishing' (*Tiáozhí Dìng*). The *Great Treatise* (*Dàlùn*) says: 'A good mind abiding in one place without moving is named Samadhi.' The Dharma-realm is that 'One Place.' Correct contemplation can abide there without moving. The four behaviors are conditions (*yuán*); contemplating the mind relies on these conditions to become rectified and established, hence they are called Samadhi.

### 1. Constant Sitting Samadhi (*Chángzuò Sānmèi*)
(Also known as the 'One Act Samadhi' (*Yīxíng Sānmèi*) from the *Manjushri Prajna Sutra*).
*   **Method:** One dwells in a quiet room or an empty place, away from noise. One sets up a single rope bed (chair) with no other seats beside it. For a period of **ninety days**, one sits cross-legged (*jie jia*) facing a specific Buddha. The neck and spine must be straight; one must not move, shake, droop, or lean. One takes a vow only to sit. The ribs must not touch the bed [to lie down], let alone sleep like a corpse, play, or stand. Except for walking meditation (*jīngxíng*), eating, and toilet, one sits constantly facing the Buddha, moment to moment continuously.
*   **Contemplation:** One concentrates on the Dharma-realm (*Fǎjiè*). One thought is the Dharma-realm. One believes that all dharmas are the Buddha-Dharma. There is no before or after, no boundaries. One sees the Buddha's marks as if looking into a mirror, yet knows the Buddha does not come and I do not go.

### 2. Constant Walking Samadhi (*Chángxíng Sānmèi*)
(Also known as the 'Buddha-Standing Samadhi' (*Pratyutpanna*)).
*   **Method:** For **ninety days**, one constantly walks and never sits or lies down (except for eating/toilet). One must have good teachers and protectors. One adorns the sanctuary with offerings.
*   **Practice:** One constantly circumambulates while chanting the name of **Amitābha Buddha** (*Āmítuófó*). Each step, each sound, each thought is only on Amitābha.
*   **Contemplation:** One visualizes Amitābha standing before one, like seeing stars at night. One contemplates the Buddha's body marks and realizes: 'The Buddha does not come to me; I do not go to the Buddha.' The mind creates the Buddha.

### 3. Part-Walking Part-Sitting Samadhi (*Bànxíng Bànzuò*)
(Based on the *Lotus Sutra* and *Vaipulya/Fangdeng* Sutras).
*   **Vaipulya Repentance:** Seven days. One circumambulates 120 times, then sits and contemplates. One recites the Dhāraṇī, confesses sins, and washes the altar.
*   **Lotus Samadhi:** Twenty-one days (3 weeks). One recites the *Lotus Sutra* while walking and sitting. One visualizes **Samantabhadra** (*Pǔxián*) riding a six-tusked white elephant. One confesses the sins of the six senses.

### 4. Neither-Walking Nor-Sitting Samadhi (*Fēixíng Fēizuò*)
(Also known as 'Following One's Own Mind' (*Suízìyì*)).
*   **Method:** This is not limited to walking or sitting. It applies to all four postures (Walking, Standing, Sitting, Lying Down) and all actions.
*   **Practice:** In every act, one contemplates the mind. 'Awareness of Mind' (*Juéyì*). One observes: Where does this thought come from? Is it the mind? Is it not the mind?
*   **Application:** One applies this to the Ten Objects (Good, Evil, Neutral). Even when anger or desire arises, one contemplates its source and nature (as Empty, Provisional, Middle)."

"**The Ten Objects of Contemplation (*Shí Jìng*):**
The objects of Cessation and Contemplation are opened into ten:
1.  **Skandhas, Entrances, and Realms** (*Yīn Rù Jiè*)
2.  **Defilements** (*Fánnǎo*)
3.  **Sickness** (*Bìnghuàn*)
4.  **Karmic Marks** (*Yèxiàng*)
5.  **Demonic Affairs** (*Móshì*)
6.  **Dhyāna Meditation** (*Chándìng*)
7.  **Views** (*Zhūjiàn*)
8.  **Overweening Pride** (*Zēngshàngmàn*)
9.  **Two Vehicles** (*Èrchéng*)
10. **Bodhisattvahood** (*Púsà*)

These ten objects can all cover and obstruct [the Path].

**1. Skandhas, Entrances, and Realms (The Primary Object):**
Why are the Skandhas placed first? For two reasons:
1.  **Always Present:** The heavy burden of the Skandhas and Entrances is always present before the practitioner. Whether walking, standing, sitting, or lying down, one never departs from the Skandhas.
2.  **Scriptural Basis:** The *Great Prajna Sutra* says: 'The Śrāvaka practices the Path relying on the Four Foundations of Mindfulness (Body/Feeling/Mind/Dharma); the Bodhisattva first contemplates Form (*Rūpa*) up to All-Knowledge.'

**The Interaction of Objects:**
*   When one contemplates the Skandhas (Result), it stirs the **Defilements** (Cause). Therefore, Defilements are discussed second.
*   The Four Elements (Body) and Three Poisons (Mind) conflict, causing **Sickness**. Therefore, Sickness is third.
*   Through sickness, one perceives the **Karmic Marks** of past deeds. Therefore, Karma is fourth.
*   As good and evil karma vie, **Demons** appear to compete for control. Therefore, Demon Works are fifth.
*   If one overcomes demons, **Dhyāna** (Meditation) arises. Therefore, Dhyāna is sixth.
*   In meditation, one may give rise to deviation, producing false **Views**. Therefore, Views are seventh.
*   If one adheres to views, one gives rise to **Arrogance** (Thinking one has attained what one has not). Therefore, Arrogance is eighth.
*   If one attaches to the small peace of partial attainment, one falls into the **Two Vehicles** (Hinayana). Therefore, Two Vehicles are ninth.
*   If one attaches to the emptiness of the Bodhisattva deeds without realizing the Middle Way, one falls into the **Bodhisattva** object (The incomplete Bodhisattva). Therefore, Bodhisattva is tenth.

**Conclusion:**
The first object (Skandhas) is the 'Constant Object' (*Cháng Jìng*). The other nine are 'Occasional Objects' (*Bùdéyǐ Jìng*)—they are only contemplated if and when they arise to obstruct the practice."
