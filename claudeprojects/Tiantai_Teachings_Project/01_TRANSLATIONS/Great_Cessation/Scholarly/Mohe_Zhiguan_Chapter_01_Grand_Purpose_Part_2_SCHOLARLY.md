> 二、勸進四種三昧入菩薩位。說是止觀者，夫欲登妙位，非行不階；善解鑽搖，醍醐可獲。《法華》云：「又見佛子，修種種行，以求佛道。」行法眾多，略言其四：一、常坐，二、常行，三、半行半坐，四、非行非坐。通稱「三昧」者，調直定也。《大論》云：「善心一處住不動，是名三昧。」法界是一處，正觀能住不動，四行為緣，觀心藉緣調直，故稱三昧也。

## 🏛️ The Architect's Translation

"**2. Cultivating the Great Practice (*Xiū Dàxíng*) to Enter the Bodhisattva Position.**
Explaining this Cessation and Contemplation: If one desires to ascend to the marvelous position, without practice one cannot scale [the heights]. By skillfully understanding the churning and shaking [of the milk], one can obtain ghee (*tíhú*). The *Lotus Sutra* says: 'Again, I see the Buddha's sons cultivating various practices to seek the Buddha-Way.' Although the methods of practice are numerous, we briefly discuss four:
1.  **Constant Sitting** (*Chángzuò*)
2.  **Constant Walking** (*Chángxíng*)
3.  **Part-Walking Part-Sitting** (*Bànxíng Bànzuò*)
4.  **Neither-Walking Nor-Sitting** (*Fēixíng Fēizuò*)

Generally, they are called **'Samadhi'** (*Sānmèi*), which means 'Rectifying and Establishing' (*Tiáozhí Dìng*). The *Great Treatise* (*Dàlùn*) says: 'A good mind abiding in one place without moving is named Samadhi.' The Dharma-realm is that 'One Place.' Correct contemplation can abide there without moving. The four behaviors are conditions (*yuán*); contemplating the mind relies on these conditions to become rectified and established, hence they are called Samadhi.

### 1. Constant Sitting Samadhi (*Chángzuò Sānmèi*)
(Also known as the 'One Act Samadhi' (*Yīxíng Sānmèi*) from the *Manjushri Prajna Sutra*).

**A. Method:**
One dwells in a quiet room or an empty place, away from noise. One sets up a single rope bed (chair) with no other seats beside it. For a period of **ninety days**, one sits cross-legged (*jiéjiā*) facing a specific Buddha. The neck and spine must be straight; one must not move, shake, droop, or lean. One takes a vow only to sit. The ribs must not touch the bed [to lie down], let alone sleep like a corpse, play, or stand. Except for walking meditation (*jīngxíng*), eating, and toilet, one sits constantly facing the Buddha, moment to moment continuously. One does not deceive the Buddha, does not fail the mind, and does not lie to sentient beings.

**B. Contemplation (Mental Stop/Look):**
One concentrates on the Dharma-realm (*Fǎjiè*). One thought is the Dharma-realm. One believes that all dharmas are the Buddha-Dharma. There is no before or after, no boundaries. One sees the Buddha's marks as if looking into a mirror, yet knows the Buddha does not come and I do not go. The mind creating the Buddha is the Buddha.

### 2. Constant Walking Samadhi (*Chángxíng Sānmèi*)
(Also known as the 'Buddha-Standing Samadhi' (*Pratyutpanna*)).

**A. Method:**
For **ninety days**, one constantly walks and never sits or lies down (except for eating/toilet). One must avoid evil friends and foolish people. One adorns the sanctuary with offerings. One constantly circumambulates while chanting the name of **Amitābha Buddha** (*Āmítuófó*). Each step, each sound, each thought is only on Amitābha.

**B. Contemplation:**
One visualizes Amitābha standing before one, like seeing stars at night. One contemplates the Buddha's body marks and realizes: 'The Buddha does not come to me; I do not go to the Buddha.' The mind creates the Buddha. 'The mind does not know the mind; the mind does not see the mind. If the mind gives rise to thought, it is ignorance; if there is no thought, it is Nirvana.'

---

### 3. Part-Walking Part-Sitting Samadhi (*Bànxíng Bànzuò*)

**A. The Vaipulya Repentance (*Fāngděng*):**
Seven days. One circumambulates 120 times, then sits and contemplates. One recites the Dhāraṇī, confesses sins, and washes the altar. One invites the Twenty-Four Honored Ones.

**B. The Lotus Samadhi (*Fǎhuá*):**
Twenty-one days (3 weeks). One recites the *Lotus Sutra* while walking and sitting. One visualizes **Samantabhadra** (*Pǔxián*) riding a six-tusked white elephant. One confesses the sins of the six senses. The Elephant represents the great strength of the Dharma-body; the six tusks represent the six paramitas; the white color represents the purity of no-outflow.

---

### 4. Neither-Walking Nor-Sitting Samadhi (*Fēixíng Fēizuò*)
(Also known as 'Following One's Own Mind' (*Suízìyì*)).

**A. Definition:**
This is not limited to walking or sitting. It applies to all four postures (Walking, Standing, Sitting, Lying Down) and all actions. It is called **'Awakening of Mental Factors Samadhi'** (*Juéyì Sānmèi*). 'Awakening' (*Jué*) is illumination; 'Mental Factors' (*Yì*) are the mind and its concomitants. When a thought arises, one reflects back and observes it.

**B. The Four Unfolding Phases (*Sì Yùn*):**
When contemplating any mental state (e.g., Desire), one observes four phases:
1.  **Not yet Desiring** (*Wèi*)
2.  **About to Desire** (*Yù*)
3.  **Currently Desiring** (*Zhèng*)
4.  **Desire has Ended** (*Yǐ*)

One asks: 'Does the desire arise from the not-yet desire? From the about-to desire?' One finds that the mind has no origin, no abiding place, and no destination. It is empty, provisional, and middle.

**C. Application to Good, Evil, and Neutral:**
*   **Good:** Applying this contemplation to the Six Paramitas (Giving, Precepts, etc.). Even in the act of giving, one sees the Giver, the Gift, and the Receiver as empty (*Trimandala*).
*   **Evil:** Applying this to the Ten Evils (Greed, Anger, etc.). Even if one falls into greed, one uses the 'Four Phases' to see that Greed is the Dharma-realm. 'The Way is not separate from Greed; Greed is immediately the Way.' This is the 'Lotus in the Fire.'
*   **Neutral:** Applying this to neutral, dull states (*Wújì*). One sees that Neutrality is also the Dharma-realm.

**Conclusion:**
Of the four Samadhis, the first three have specific methods (*fāngfǎ*), but the fourth is purely Principle-Contemplation (*lǐguān*). If one understands the Principle, every action is Samadhi."

## 📜 Doctrinal Analysis

1.  **The Four Samadhis:** This classification is Zhiyi's grand synthesis of Buddhist practice.
    *   **Constant Sitting:** Correspond to Zen/Chan (Dhyana-focused).
    *   **Constant Walking:** Corresponds to Pure Land (Amitabha-focused).
    *   **Half/Half:** Corresponds to Esoteric/Ritual practice (Mantra/Repentance).
    *   **Neither/Nor:** Corresponds to "Daily Life Zen" or the "Direct Path."
2.  **Following One's Own Mind (*Suízìyì*):** This is the most radical and advanced practice. It allows the practitioner to use *any* mental state—even anger or lust—as the object of meditation. By applying the "Four Phases," one realizes that the defilement has no substance.
3.  **The Four Phases (*Sì Yùn*):** This analytic tool deconstructs the continuity of time. By looking for the "mind" in the past (not yet), present (desiring), or future (ended), one fails to find it. This "failure to find" (*pǒdé*) is the realization of Emptiness.
