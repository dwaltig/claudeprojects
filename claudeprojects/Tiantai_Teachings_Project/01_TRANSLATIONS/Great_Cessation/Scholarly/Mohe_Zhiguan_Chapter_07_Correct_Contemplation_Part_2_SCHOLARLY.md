## 🏛️ The Architect's Translation

"**Mode 2: Arousing the True Mind of Awakening (*Fā Zhènzhèng Pútíxīn*):**
Having deeply recognized the **Inconceivable Object** (the interpenetration of all worlds), one realizes that 'one suffering is all suffering.' One feels compassion for one's own past suffering—the eons spent chasing fleeting pleasures while bound in the 'Burning House'—and extends this to all beings.

**The Four Great Vows (*Sìhóng Shìyuàn*):**
Out of this non-dual compassion, one gives rise to the four vows, rooted in the Inconceivable:
1.  **Vow to save all beings:** Though beings are empty like space, one vows to save these 'empty' beings.
2.  **Vow to sever all afflictions:** Though afflictions have no solid substance, one vows to sever them.
3.  **Vow to know all Dharma-gates:** Though the truth is silent, one vows to learn all the 'mirages' of the teaching to help others.
4.  **Vow to attain the Unsurpassed Way:** Realizing that Buddhahood is not a 'thing' to be gained, one vows to attain it for the sake of all.

This is the **True and Correct Bodhicitta**: It is neither 'poisoned' by attachment to a self-saving goal nor 'biased' by a cold emptiness that ignores the world.

**Mode 3: Skillfully Resting the Mind (*Shànqiǎo Ānxīn*):**
To fulfill these vows, one must use **Zhiguan** (Stop and Look) to 'rest' the mind in the **Dharma-nature** (*Fǎxìng*). The mind is like a wild horse; it must be skillfully comforted and settled.

**A. The Essence of Resting:**
One recognizes that Ignorance (*Wúmíng*) is not separate from Dharma-nature. Like cold turning water into ice, delusion turns the mind into 'flowing' thoughts. To 'rest' is to realize that these thoughts *are* the Dharma-nature. This is **Cessation (*Zhǐ*)**. To illuminate this stillness is **Contemplation (*Guān*)**.

**B. The Two Kinds of Practitioners:**
1.  **Faith-Followers (*Xìnxíng*):** Those who rest their mind through hearing the teaching. They rely on the Buddha’s word to find peace.
2.  **Dharma-Followers (*Fǎxíng*):** Those who rest their mind through internal inquiry and meditation. They rely on their own observation of the mind's patterns.

**C. The Eight Scenario Comforts:**
If the mind does not find rest in the first mode, the master (or the practitioner's own wisdom) employs 'Eight Scenarios' based on the **Four Siddhāntas** (Worldly, Individual, Counteractive, and Ultimate). One tries resting in Emptiness, then in the Provisional, then in the Middle, adjusting until the mind is 'comforted' and still."

## 📜 Doctrinal Analysis

1.  **True Bodhicitta:** In Tiantai, true Bodhicitta is not just a good intention; it is an ontological realization. It arises *from* the insight into the Inconceivable. You save beings because you see they are *already* the Buddha-nature, but they don't know it.
2.  **An Xin (Resting the Mind):** This is the bridge between the Vow (Mode 2) and the Breaking (Mode 4). Before you start smashing delusions, you must have a stable base. "Resting" means finding the "Middle" where the mind is neither tense nor lax.
