# Chapter 14: The Buddha

The Buddha. The awakened one. Victory that can't be undone, range that's endless, path that can't be traced. This chapter gives us the teaching in three lines: don't do evil, do good, purify your mind. That's the whole thing. And the three refuges—not in mountains or trees, but in Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha. THAT'S where freedom lives.

## Verses 179 and 180: The Pathless One

The Buddha said:

"He whose victory cannot be undone, whose victory no one in the world approaches, the Buddha, whose range is endless, the pathless one—by what path can you lead him?

He who has no ensnaring craving to lead him anywhere—the Buddha, whose range is endless, the pathless one—by what path can you lead him?"

And here's the Blues truth: His victory can't be undone. Nobody in the world comes close. The Buddha, endless in his range—the pathless one, beyond reproach.

By what path can you lead him? No craving leads him anywhere. Trackless, like birds in the sky. No way to follow him back—the liberated one cannot be led by desire.

## Verses 181 and 182: Four Rare Things

The Buddha said:

"Those wise ones intent on meditation, who delight in the peace of renunciation—even the gods are envious of them, the Fully Awakened Ones, the mindful.

Rare is birth as a human; rare is the life of mortals; rare is hearing the True Dhamma; rare is the arising of Buddhas."

And here's the Blues truth: Even the gods are jealous of those who meditate and know. Even the gods look down with envy on the fully awakened ones.

FOUR RARE THINGS: Rare to be born human. Rare this mortal life. Rare to hear the True Dhamma. Rare when a Buddha arrives.

Don't waste what you've got. This opportunity is precious—most beings don't get this shot. We've already won the lottery; don't waste the ticket.

## Verse 183: The Teaching of ALL Buddhas

The Buddha said:

"The non-doing of any wickedness, the undertaking of what is good, the purification of one's own mind—this is the teaching of the Buddhas."

And here's the Blues truth: DON'T DO EVIL. DO WHAT'S GOOD. PURIFY YOUR MIND.

That's it. That's the teaching. That's what every Buddha said. Simple to say, lifetime to accomplish. Everything else is commentary.

## Verses 184 and 185: Non-Harm and Practice

The Buddha said:

"Enduring patience is the supreme austerity. Nibbāna is supreme, say the Buddhas. One gone forth does not hurt another; an ascetic does not harass another.

Not finding fault, not hurting, restraint by the discipline, knowing the right measure of food, living in a remote dwelling, devotion to meditation—this is the teaching of the Buddhas."

And here's the Blues truth: Patience is the supreme austerity—not self-torture but forbearance. Nibbāna is supreme, say the Buddhas. Those gone forth don't hurt another.

The six guidelines: Not finding fault. Not hurting. Restrained by discipline. Knowing the right measure of food. Living remote. Devoted to meditation. THAT'S the teaching.

## Verses 186 and 187: No Satisfaction in Pleasure

The Buddha said:

"Not through a rain of coins is satisfaction found in sense pleasures. The wise one knows: 'Sense pleasures have little joy and much suffering.' Not even in heavenly pleasures does that one find delight. The disciple of the Fully Awakened One delights in craving's destruction."

And here's the Blues truth: Rain down coins—satisfaction won't be found. Sense pleasures have little joy and much suffering around. Even heavenly pleasures don't satisfy the wise.

The Buddha's disciple delights in craving's final demise. Not in getting more—in ENDING the wanting. That's where joy is, that's where peace is—in craving's end, not craving's haunting.

## Verses 188 through 192: The Three Refuges

The Buddha said:

"Many people shaken by fear go for refuge to mountains and forests, to tree-shrines in pleasure parks.

That is not a secure refuge; that is not the supreme refuge; coming to that refuge does not liberate from all suffering.

But whoever has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, and sees with right wisdom the Four Noble Truths: Suffering, the arising of suffering, the overcoming of suffering, the Noble Eightfold Path leading to the stilling of suffering—THAT is a secure refuge; THAT is the supreme refuge. Coming to that refuge liberates from all suffering."

And here's the Blues truth: Shaken by fear, people run to mountains, forests, tree shrines. Looking for safety.

BUT—that's not a safe refuge. That won't end the suffering stream.

Whoever takes refuge in BUDDHA, DHAMMA, SANGHA, and sees the Four Noble Truths with right wisdom—Suffering, its arising, its overcoming, the Eightfold Path that stills it—THAT is a safe refuge. THAT liberates from every suffering stream.

Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha. THAT'S where freedom lives.

## Verses 193 through 196: The Buddha's Arising Is Good

The Buddha said:

"A person of noble breed is rare, not born everywhere. Wherever that wise one is born, that family gains happiness.

Good is the arising of Buddhas; good is the teaching of True Dhamma; good is the harmony of the Sangha; good is devotion to harmony.

Those who worship the worthy—whether Buddhas or disciples, who have overcome impediments, crossed over grief and lamentation—for those who worship such fearless ones, the emancipated—no one can measure their merit."

And here's the Blues truth: A noble person is rare, not born everywhere. Wherever they're born, that family gets happiness to share.

Good is the arising of Buddhas. Good is the teaching of truth. Good is the harmony of Sangha. Those who worship the awakened—their merit is beyond measure.

## End of Chapter 14

What we learned in these eighteen verses gives us the heart of Buddhism. The Buddha's victory can't be undone. He's pathless—you can't lead him by desire. Even gods envy the awakened. Four rare things: human birth, life, Dhamma, Buddha. THE TEACHING: Don't do evil, do good, purify your mind. Patience is supreme austerity. No rain of coins satisfies craving. Mountains and forests aren't safe refuge. BUDDHA, DHAMMA, SANGHA—that's the refuge. See the Four Noble Truths with wisdom. Good is the Buddha's arising, Dhamma's teaching, Sangha's harmony.

Don't do evil. Do what's good. Purify your mind. That's the word.
