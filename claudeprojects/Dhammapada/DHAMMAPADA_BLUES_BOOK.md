# ABOUT THE DHAMMAPADA

The Dhammapada ("Verses of the Teaching") is one of the most beloved texts in all of Buddhism. Its 423 verses, organized into 26 chapters, were composed in Pali and transmitted orally for centuries before being written down around the 1st century BCE.

According to tradition, these verses were spoken by the Buddha himself over the course of his 45-year teaching ministry, then gathered by his disciples after his passing. At the First Buddhist Council, held shortly after the Buddha's death, his attendant Ānanda recited the discourses from memory while the assembly verified their authenticity.

The Dhammapada belongs to the Khuddaka Nikāya (Minor Collection) of the Pali Canon—the oldest complete Buddhist scripture surviving in an Indic language. Alongside the verses, a traditional commentary (the Dhammapada Aṭṭhakathā) preserves the origin stories explaining when and why each verse was spoken.

For 2,500 years, these words have been memorized, chanted, and lived by practitioners seeking liberation. This interpretation carries that ancient stream into contemporary American English, using the rhythms and imagery of the Blues tradition to let the teaching land where it's meant to land—in the heart.

# FRONT MATTER

## A Note from the Interpreter

You hold in your hands something ancient made new. The Dhammapada—"verses of the teaching"—was composed over 2,500 years ago in Pali, an ancient Indian language. The Buddha's earliest followers memorized these 423 verses, chanted them, passed them mouth to ear across generations.

They were meant to be FELT, not just understood. Poetry for the heart, not prose for the intellect.

The Blues comes from a different soil—the Mississippi Delta, the juke joints, the long roads of African American experience. But it carries the same truth: suffering is real, and freedom is possible. You reap what you sow. Your mind creates your world. And the only way out is through.

This translation uses Blues rhythm and Blues language to let these verses hit where they're supposed to hit—in the gut, in the bones, in the midnight hour when you're alone with your thoughts.

Every teaching here is the Buddha's. The voice is the Blues.

May it serve your liberation.

# BOOK ONE: THE FOUNDATIONAL TEACHINGS

## Chapter 1: Yamakavagga (Twin Verses)
### Your Mind Writes the First Verse

---

### Verses 1-2: Mind Is the Boss

Listen here, baby—  
Everything starts upstairs in your head.  
Your mind's the boss of this whole operation,  
The director of your movie,  
The one writing the first line of every song you sing.

You wake up with poison in your thinking,  
Spite and greed running your show,  
Then open your mouth or make your move—  
Misery gonna follow you like a bloodhound.  
Like the wheel rolling behind that old ox pulling the cart,  
Ain't no way to shake it.¹

But you wake up with clear water in your mind,  
Kindness and truth running your show,  
Then speak your piece or make your move—  
Joy gonna stick to you like your shadow at noon.  
Can't lose it even if you tried.

---

### Verses 3-4: Don't Keep Singing That Sad Song

Somebody done you wrong.  
They lied on you, cheated you,  
Beat you down, took what's yours.  
That's the truth, that's what happened.

But now you got a choice:

You can sit up all night  
Singing that same song:  
"He abused me, he struck me,  
He beat me, he robbed me"—  
Play it over and over like a scratched record.¹

You do that?  
The hate don't never quit.  
Gonna own you more than that person who wronged you ever did.

OR—

You can know what happened,  
You can name it true,  
But you don't gotta make it your theme song.  
You can put that record back in the sleeve.

Do THAT?  
The hate dies down.  
Leaves you free to write a new chorus.

---

### Verse 5: The Old, Old Law

You can't put out fire with fire.  
You can't stop hate with hate.  
Fight poison with poison, all you get is more poison.

Only way to kill that hate  
Is to meet it with something else entirely.  
Meet it with non-hate.  
Meet it with love, or at least with letting go.²

That's the law. Old as the hills.  
You can buck against it if you want,  
But it ain't gonna change.

---

### Verse 6: We're All Dying Here

Most folks walking around  
Don't really get it:  
We're all dying here.  
Every one of us.  
Your time, my time—  
It's running out while we stand here arguing.

But the wise ones,  
The ones who've sat with death long enough  
To know it's real—  
They stop fighting about small things.³

When you know you got limited time,  
You ain't got energy to waste  
On quarrels that don't matter.

---

### Verses 7-8: Weak Trees and Mountains

Two kinds of people in this world:

**The Weak Tree:**

You spend your days  
Chasing every pretty thing that walks by,  
Letting your eyes, your ears, your tongue  
Run wild like kids with no supervision.

You're like a tree with pretty leaves  
But rotten roots.  
First strong wind that comes—  
Māra (that's death, that's delusion)  
Gonna knock you right over.⁴

**The Mountain:**

But you train yourself,  
Keep your senses on a leash,  
Build that faith, build that strength—

You like a mountain.  
Storm can howl,  
Wind can blow—  
You ain't moving.  
Māra ain't got nothing on you.

---

### Verses 9-10: The Robe Don't Make the Monk

You can put on the uniform,  
Wear the robe, the collar, the cross,  
Talk the holy talk—

But if your heart's still full of the same old mess,  
If you ain't done the work to clean yourself up,  
That robe ain't nothing but a costume.  
You playing dress-up.⁵

BUT—

If you've spit out all that poison,  
If you've done the hard work of getting clean,  
If your life lines up with what you claim—

Then you EARNED that robe.  
Not 'cause of the cloth,  
But 'cause of who you became.

---

### Verses 11-12: Fool's Gold and Real Gold

Lots of folks out here  
Chasing fool's gold,  
Thinking the shiny stuff is real.

They mistake:  
- Pleasure for happiness  
- Money for security  
- Fame for worth⁶

They running after sapwood,  
The soft outside of the tree,  
Thinking it's the heartwood,  
The strong core.

BUT—

The wise can tell the difference.  
They chase the REAL stuff:  
- Freedom over pleasure  
- Wisdom over information  
- Character over reputation  
- Peace over excitement

And they FIND it.

---

### Verses 13-14: Leaky Roofs and Good Roofs

Your mind is like a house,  
And desire is like rain.

**The Leaky House:**

You ain't done no maintenance on your mind,  
Ain't trained it,  
Ain't built up no protection—

When the rain of wanting comes,  
It's gonna pour right through.  
Soak everything.⁷

**The Solid House:**

But you do the work,  
You train your mind through meditation,  
Build it strong through discipline—

When that same rain comes,  
It just runs off.  
You stay dry.  
The want comes, but it don't rule you.

---

### Verses 15-16: Now and Later

Two roads, two destinations.

**The Sorrow Road:**

You do wrong—  
Harm folks, lie, steal, destroy—

You hurt RIGHT NOW.  
Conscience eating at you.

And you hurt LATER.  
When the consequences roll around  
(And they always do).⁸

**The Joy Road:**

But you do right—  
Help folks, tell truth, build up, protect—

You FEEL GOOD right now.  
That clean-conscience peace.

And you feel BETTER later.  
Joy here,  
Greater joy there.

---

### Verses 17-18: Burning and Bliss

**The Burning:**

You do evil,  
You BURN right now.  
"I did that terrible thing"—  
That thought alone scorches you.

Then later,  
The fire don't quit,  
It GROWS.

**The Bliss:**

You do good,  
You REJOICE right now.  
"I did that beautiful thing"—  
That thought alone lifts you up.

The joy don't quit,  
It MULTIPLIES.⁹

---

### Verses 19-20: Talking Ain't Walking

**The Scholar Who Don't Walk:**

You can memorize every holy book,  
Quote scripture all day long—

But if you ain't DOING it,  
You like a cowherd  
Counting somebody else's cows.

They ain't YOUR cows.  
That ain't YOUR wisdom.¹⁰

**The Practitioner Who Walks:**

But say you only know a LITTLE bit—

But you LIVE it.  
You actually give up your greed,  
You actually let go of your hate.

THAT'S the spiritual life.  
Not what you memorized,  
But what you BECAME.

---

## Chapter 2: Appamādavagga (Heedfulness)
### Staying Woke on the Path

---

### Verses 21-22: Wake Up or Stay Dead

Wakefulness, wakefulness—that's the deathless road.  
Sleepwalking, sleepwalking—that's where the dead folks go.

Stay woke and you don't die.  
Stay sleep—might as well be dead.¹¹

The wise ones, they understand.  
So they love staying awake,  
Rejoice in the Noble Ones' way.

---

### Verse 23: The Meditators Who Keep At It

Sit down, sit down, keep on sitting.  
Show up, show up, day after day.  
Don't quit when it gets hard.

Those who meditate—they touch Nibbāna.  
Those who persist—they find release.¹²

---

### Verse 24: The One Who Does the Work

For the person who gets up and does the work,  
Who stays mindful,  
Whose actions are clean,  
Who's got self-control,  
Who lives by the teachings,  
Who stays awake—

That person's reputation grows.  
Not 'cause they're chasing fame,  
But 'cause truth shines through.

---

### Verse 25: Build Your Island

Through effort, through wakefulness,  
Through self-control, through restraint—

Build, build, build your island.  
Build your higher ground.  
When the flood comes rising—  
And the flood WILL come—  
You got a place to stand.¹³

---

### Verses 26-27: Fools Sleep, Wise Stay Woke

Fools cultivate sleep, cultivate sleep.  
Fools practice drifting.

But the wise one guards wakefulness,  
Guards wakefulness like gold.

Don't cultivate drifting—  
Stay awake, stay meditating—  
THAT'S where happiness lives.  
The real kind. The lasting kind.

---

### Verse 28: The View from the Mountain

When the wise one pushes out sleepwalking  
By practicing staying awake,  
Climbs up to wisdom's high place—

They look out and see all the grieving people below,  
Like someone standing on a mountain  
Looking down at folks stuck on the flatlands.¹⁴

---

### Verse 29: The Fast Horse and the Slow Horse

Heedful among the heedless,  
Wakeful among the sleeping—

The sage moves on, moves on,  
Like a fast horse leaving the slow one.  
Not racing—just different speed.

---

### Verse 30: How the King of Gods Got His Throne

Maghavā—the king of the gods himself—  
Got to the top through staying awake.  
Through heedfulness.¹⁵

People praise wakefulness.  
Everybody blames sleep.  
This ain't controversial.

---

### Verses 31-32: The Monk Who Can't Fall

A monk who delights in wakefulness,  
Who sees danger in sleep—

Burns through the bindings,  
Like fire burns through rope.  
Big bindings, little bindings,  
All of it—consumed.

Can't fall back. Can't regress.  
Standing right at Nibbāna's door.¹⁶

---

## Chapter 3: Cittavagga (The Mind)
### Training the Wildest Thing You Own

---

### Verses 33-34: The Mind Like a Fish, Like an Arrow

Your mind, your mind—  
It's shaking, it's twitching.  
Can't guard it, can't hold it.

But the wise one straightens that mind,  
Like a fletcher straightening an arrow,  
Patient, skilled, seeing it through.¹⁷

Your mind's like a fish thrown on dry land,  
Flopping, gasping, wild with fear—  
That's what happens when you pull it from distraction.

But that's exactly why you train it.  
Use the panic to throw off Māra.

---

### Verses 35-36: Guard What You Can't See

Hard to tame, hard to tame,  
Flits wherever it wants.  
Restraint is good—restraint brings peace.

Hard to see, hard to see,  
Subtle as smoke in the dark.  
Guard it well—guarding brings peace.¹⁸

---

### Verse 37: The Mind That Roams Far

It roams far, roams alone,  
Has no body, hides in a cave.  
But those who restrain it get free.¹⁹

Māra's bonds—  
Those who tame mind break free.

---

### Verses 38-39: Unsettled and Settled

Unsettled mind, unsettled mind,  
Doesn't know the True Teaching.  
Confidence wavers, wisdom never fills up.

BUT—

Free from lust, free from confusion,  
Abandoned both merit and sin.  
For the wakeful—no fear. Not within.²⁰

---

### Verse 40: The Jar and the Fortress

Your body, your body—  
Fragile like a clay pot.

Your mind, your mind—  
Build it like a fortress.²¹

Fight Māra with wisdom,  
Guard what you've won—  
But don't cling to the perks.

---

### Verse 41: The Body's Fate

Soon, soon, this body  
Will lie on the ground.  
Rejected, abandoned,  
No consciousness inside.  
Just a useless piece of wood.²²

So what are you waiting for?  
Train your mind NOW.

---

### Verses 42-43: Your Worst Enemy, Your Best Friend

What an enemy does to an enemy—  
A wrongly-directed mind  
Does worse to you than they'll ever know.²³

BUT—

What your mama couldn't do for you,  
What your daddy couldn't give—  
A rightly-directed mind helps you live.

Point it right, point it right—  
Better than any kin.  
Point it wrong, point it wrong—  
Worse than any sin.

---

## Chapter 4: Pupphavagga (Flowers)
### What Blooms and What Fades

---

### Verses 44-45: Who Knows the Dhamma Like a Flower?

Who will know this earth?  
Who will know the realms below and the heavens above?

The trainee knows this earth.  
The trainee reflects on Dhamma,  
Like someone skilled reflecting on a flower's face.²⁴

---

### Verse 46: Body Like Foam

This body—  
It's foam on the water.  
It's a mirage in the heat.

See it for what it is,  
Cut off Māra's pretty arrows tipped with flowers.  
Go beyond where Death can see.²⁵

---

### Verses 47-48: Gathering Flowers When Death Comes

Gathering flowers, gathering flowers,  
Mind attached to what you're picking—  
Death comes, Death comes,  
Like a flood sweeping a sleeping village.²⁶

Never satisfied, never satisfied,  
Still wanting more when Death arrives.

---

### Verse 49: Be Like the Bee

The bee takes nectar,  
But doesn't hurt the flower.  
Doesn't damage color or scent.

Be like the bee,  
Take what you need,  
But leave the source all right.²⁷

---

### Verse 50: Mind Your Own Business

Not what others did wrong.  
Not what they did or didn't do—  
That's none of your concern.

Look at what YOU did wrong.  
What you did and didn't do—  
THAT'S your business to learn.²⁸

---

### Verses 51-52: Flowers With and Without Scent

A beautiful flower with no scent—  
That's like pretty words from someone  
Who don't do what they meant.

A beautiful flower WITH fragrance—  
That's like truth from someone  
Who lives it every day.²⁹

---

### Verse 53: Make Garlands from Your Life

From a heap of flowers,  
Make many, many garlands.

From your mortal life,  
Do many, many goods.³⁰

You're born, you'll die—  
So weave something beautiful while you can.

---

### Verses 54-56: Virtue's Fragrance Rises

Flower perfume follows the wind—  
Sandalwood, jasmine, all go where the breeze blows.

But virtue's fragrance?  
Goes AGAINST the wind, spreads everywhere.³¹

Nothing compared to virtue,  
Nothing compared to living right.  
Virtue rises all the way to the gods.

---

### Verses 58-59: The Lotus in the Garbage

On a garbage heap,  
Thrown by the highway side—  
A lotus grows,  
Pure and beautiful inside.

Sweet-scented, mind-delighting,  
Rising from the muck and grime.³²

Among the blind folks, ordinary folks—  
The Buddha's student shines,  
Wisdom lighting up the heart.

---

## Chapter 5: Bālavagga (Fools)
### Your Own Worst Enemy

---

### Verse 60: Long is the Night

Long is the night, long is the night  
When you can't find sleep.  
Long is the road when your body's weak.

But longer still  
Is the wheel of birth and death  
For fools who won't learn Dhamma.³³

---

### Verse 61: Walk Alone If You Must

If you can't find someone better,  
If you can't find someone the same,  
Walk alone, walk alone—  
There's no friendship in a fool's game.³⁴

Better lonely than bad company.

---

### Verse 62: Nothing Is Yours

"Sons are mine! Riches are mine!"  
So the fool worries and frets.

But if your SELF ain't even yours—  
And friend, it ain't—  
How can sons be? How can gold be?³⁵

Nothing's yours, nothing's yours,  
Not even the one who's grabbing.

---

### Verse 63: The Wise Fool

A fool who knows he's foolish—  
At least he's got that right.

But a fool proud of his wisdom,  
Thinking he's the smartest one—  
HE'S the fool, the REAL fool.³⁶

Know you don't know—  
That's where wisdom starts.

---

### Verses 64-65: The Spoon and the Tongue

A fool can sit with a wise man,  
Sit with him his whole life long—  
Won't learn a drop of Dhamma,  
Like a spoon that can't taste the song.

Spoon in the curry, spoon in the curry,  
Never tastes a single bite.³⁷

BUT—

A perceptive one sits with a wise man  
For just a moment's time—  
Learns the Dhamma quick as lightning,  
Like the tongue that tastes the rhyme.

---

### Verse 66: Your Own Enemy

Stupid fools walk around  
With their worst enemy inside.

Doing wicked deeds,  
Planting bitter fruit.  
You're your own enemy at the root.³⁸

---

### Verse 69: Sweet Until It Ripens

The fool thinks it's sweet  
While the deed is still young.

But when that deed ripens—  
The fool suffers.  
Bitter after the sweet he knew.³⁹

---

### Verse 71: Fire Under Ashes

A wicked deed don't show right away,  
Like milk don't curdle fast.

Smoldering, smoldering,  
Following the fool.  
Fire under ashes—  
Burning like hidden fuel.⁴⁰

---

### Verse 75: Two Different Roads

The road to gains is one road.  
The road to Nibbāna's another.

Don't delight in honors,  
Don't crave the clapping hands.  
Cultivate solitude—  
That's where freedom stands.⁴¹

---

## Chapter 6: Paṇḍitavagga (The Wise)
### Those Who Know and Do

---

The wise one points out faults  
Like pointing out treasure.  
Follow that wise one—  
It'll go better, not worse.⁴²

Admonish, advise, hold back from wrong.  
The good love the one who speaks true.  
The wicked? They don't like the teaching.  
But that tells you who is who.

Don't make friends with the wicked.  
Don't make friends with the low.  
Make friends with the good,  
The best of people you know.⁴³

One who drinks Dhamma lives well,  
Mind clear as mountain water.  
The wise one delights in Dhamma—  
That's what the Noble Ones offer.

Course-makers lead water.  
Fletchers straighten arrows.  
Carpenters straighten wood.  
The wise master themselves.⁴⁴

As a solid rock  
Is not shaken by the wind,  
So the wise are not shaken  
By praise or blame within.⁴⁵

---

## Chapter 7: Arahantavagga (The Arahants)
### The Ones Who Made It Home

---

Those whose journey is done,  
Sorrow-free, completely liberated—  
All knots abandoned—  
Burning fever doesn't exist for them.⁴⁶

The mindful ones apply themselves,  
Don't delight in dwelling places.  
Like geese abandoning the lake,  
They leave behind home after home.⁴⁷

Hard to understand is the track  
Of those who leave no trace—  
Like birds through the sky.⁴⁸

---

## Chapter 8: Sahassavagga (Thousands)
### Quality Over Quantity

---

Better than a thousand meaningless words  
Is ONE word that brings peace.  
One word that, hearing it,  
One is calmed.⁴⁹

Better than a thousand meaningless verses  
Is ONE verse that brings peace.

Better than a hundred meaningless gathas  
Is ONE gatha that brings peace.

Better to conquer yourself  
Than to conquer a thousand men  
A thousand times in battle.  
Conquest over YOURSELF—  
THAT'S the supreme victory.⁵⁰

---

## Chapter 9: Pāpavagga (Evil)
### The Drip Becomes a Flood

---

Make haste toward the good,  
Restrain your mind from evil.  
If you're slow doing good,  
The mind delights in wickedness.⁵¹

If you do something wrong,  
Don't make a habit of it.  
Don't find pleasure in it.  
Accumulated evil brings suffering.

"It won't come to me"—  
So thinks the fool while doing wrong.  
But drop by drop, drop by drop,  
The water pot fills up.⁵²

Same with good.  
Little by little, the wise one fills up with good.

---

## Chapter 10: Daṇḍavagga (Violence)
### The Rod That Returns

---

Everyone trembles at violence.  
Everyone fears death.  
Comparing yourself to others,  
Don't strike or have others strike.⁵³

Everyone loves their life.  
Knowing this—  
Why would you bring them fear?

If someone strikes you  
And you make no sound,  
Like a broken gong—  
You've reached Nibbāna.  
Contention is not found in you.⁵⁴

---

## Chapter 11: Jarāvagga (Old Age)
### The Housebuilder Has Been Seen

---

Why the laughter, why the joy,  
When the world's on fire?  
Wrapped in darkness—  
Why don't you seek something higher?⁵⁵

See this beautified puppet,  
A heap of sores dressed up.  
Nothing in it's truly mine.

This fortress made of bones,  
Plastered over with flesh and blood.  
But inside hides old age,  
Death, conceit, and anger's flood.⁵⁶

Royal chariots decay.  
Bodies decay.  
But the Dhamma of the good doesn't decay—  
The good pass it to the good.

Through countless births, countless deaths,  
I wandered and I wandered.  
Seeking the housebuilder,  
Born again, suffering again.

**O HOUSEBUILDER, I SEE YOU NOW!  
You won't build this house again!  
All your rafters are BROKEN,  
The ridgepole's at its end!**⁵⁷

My mind has reached the unconditioned.  
Craving's end has been achieved.

---

## Chapter 12: Attavagga (The Self)
### Nobody Can Purify You But You

---

If you love yourself, guard yourself.  
Train yourself FIRST, then teach others.  
Self is the friend of self—what other friend is there?⁵⁸

Evil done by yourself  
Crushes you  
Like diamond crushing rock.⁵⁹

By yourself is evil done.  
By yourself are you defiled.  
By yourself is evil NOT done.  
By yourself are you purified.

**Purity and impurity come from YOU alone.  
NO ONE CAN PURIFY ANOTHER.**⁶⁰

---

## Chapter 13: Lokavagga (The World)
### Bubble, Mirage, Gilded Trap

---

See it as a bubble.  
See it as a mirage.  
Looking on the world that way—  
Death's king can't find your passage.⁶¹

Come, look at this world,  
Gilded like a royal ride.  
Fools become depressed—  
No bond for those who understand.⁶²

Was heedless before? But now you've woken up—  
You shine on this world  
Like the moon when clouds break up.⁶³

Rule the whole earth—  
Go to heaven above—  
Be lord of all the worlds—  
BETTER is the first taste of freedom.  
Stream-entry, just the first step—  
Worth more than ruling everything.⁶⁴

---

## Chapter 14: Buddhavagga (The Buddha)
### Pathless, Trackless, Supreme

---

His victory can't be undone.  
Nobody in the world comes close.  
The Buddha, endless in his range—  
By what path can you lead the pathless one?⁶⁵

FOUR RARE THINGS:  
Rare to be born human.  
Rare this mortal life.  
Rare to hear the True Dhamma.  
Rare when a Buddha arrives.⁶⁶

**THE TEACHING OF ALL BUDDHAS:**  
**DON'T DO EVIL.  
DO WHAT'S GOOD.  
PURIFY YOUR MIND.**⁶⁷

Mountains and forests aren't safe refuge.  
Coming to THAT won't free you.

Whoever takes refuge in BUDDHA,  
Whoever takes refuge in DHAMMA,  
Whoever takes refuge in SANGHA,  
And sees the Four Noble Truths—  
**THAT is the refuge supreme.  
Coming to THAT liberates.**⁶⁸

---

## Chapter 15: Sukhavagga (Happiness)
### The Real Kind

---

Let us live happily,  
Without hate among the haters.  
Let us live happily,  
Without sickness among the sick.  
Let us live happily,  
Without longing among the longers.⁶⁹

We live happily enough  
Having no possessions.  
We will feed on joy  
Like the gods of Streaming Light.

The victor breeds hatred.  
The loser finds pain.  
The one AT PEACE lives happily—  
Dropped the whole victory game.⁷⁰

No fire like passion.  
No offense like hate.  
No suffering like the aggregates.  
**No happiness beyond peace.**⁷¹

Nibbāna is the supreme good.

---

## Chapter 16: Piyavagga (What Is Dear)
### The Root of Grief and Fear

---

From LOVE comes grief.  
From LOVE comes fear.  
Free from love? No grief. How could there be fear?

From FONDNESS comes grief.  
From FONDNESS comes fear.

From DELIGHT comes grief.  
From DELIGHT comes fear.

From DESIRE comes grief.  
From DESIRE comes fear.

From CRAVING comes grief.  
From CRAVING comes fear.⁷²

Five names for the same root.  
Cut the root—  
And grief and fear go moot.

---

## Chapter 17: Kodhavagga (Anger)
### Hold Back the Swerving Chariot

---

Abandon anger, abandon conceit,  
Get past every chain.

Anger rises like a swerving chariot  
Running off the road.  
Hold it back—  
**THAT'S the charioteer's code.**⁷³

Others just hold the reins.  
The one who CONTROLS the anger?  
THAT'S the one with real pride.

Overcome anger with NON-anger.  
Overcome bad with GOOD.  
Overcome stinginess with GIVING.  
Overcome lies with TRUTH.⁷⁴

Nobody in the world escapes blame.  
Don't seek universal approval—  
It doesn't exist.⁷⁵

Guard against anger in BODY.  
Guard against anger in SPEECH.  
Guard against anger in MIND.  
Three gates. Full restraint.⁷⁶

---

## Chapter 18: Malavagga (Impurity)
### Rust Eats the Iron It Comes From

---

You're like a withered leaf.  
Yama's messengers are at the door.  
Standing at decay's gate—  
With no provisions for the journey.

**MAKE YOUR ISLAND!**  
Quickly strive, become wise.  
Remove the stain, become blemishless.⁷⁷

The sage removes stains gradually,  
Little by little, moment by moment—  
Like a silversmith polishing silver.⁷⁸

Rust comes from iron,  
Then eats the iron it came from.  
Your own deeds work the same way.⁷⁹

**IGNORANCE is the supreme stain.**  
Abandon that one—  
Be stainless.

No fire like PASSION.  
No grip like HATRED.  
No snare like DELUSION.  
No flood like CRAVING.⁸⁰

Easy to see others' faults.  
Your own? Hard to find.

---

## Chapter 19: Dhammaṭṭhavagga (The Just)
### Not by X Are You Y

---

Not by speaking much are you wise.

Not by grey hair are you an elder.⁸¹

Not by eloquence or beauty are you honorable.

Not by shaved head are you an ascetic.⁸²

Not by eating almsfood are you a monastic.

Not by silence is a fool a seer.

Not by hurting beings are you noble.

Don't be confident  
Until pollutants are destroyed.⁸³

---

## Chapter 20: Maggavagga (The Path)
### There Is No Other

---

**The Eightfold Path is best of paths.  
Four Truths are best of all.  
Passionlessness is the best state.  
The Buddha's the best who stands tall.**

**THIS is the path—  
There is no other way.**⁸⁴

Your duty is ARDOR.  
The Buddhas just point the way.

**All conditions are IMPERMANENT.**  
See this with wisdom, and you'll be free.

**All conditions are SUFFERING.**  
See this with wisdom, and you'll be free.

**All dhammas are WITHOUT SELF.**  
See this with wisdom, and you'll be free.⁸⁵

Cut the FOREST of defilements, not just a tree.

Death comes like a flood on a sleeping village.  
Children, father, kin can't save you.  
QUICKLY purify the path to Nibbāna.⁸⁶

---

## Chapter 21: Pakiṇṇakavagga (Miscellaneous)
### Collected Gems

---

Give up small good for greater good.

Six Recollections—day and night:  
Mindfulness of Buddha.  
Mindfulness of Dhamma.  
Mindfulness of Sangha.  
Mindfulness of Body.  
Delight in Non-violence.  
Delight in Cultivation.⁸⁷

The good shine from far away  
Like snow-covered mountains.  
The wicked are unseen  
Like arrows shot in the night.⁸⁸

Sitting alone. Lying alone. Walking alone.  
The solitary one who trains oneself  
Will delight at the forest's edge.

---

## Chapter 22: Nirayavagga (Hell)
### The Underworld Awaits the Unwary

---

Liars go to hell.  
"I didn't do it" when you did? Hell.

Many wear the robe with wickedness inside.  
Through wicked deeds—hell.⁸⁹

Better to eat a GLOWING IRON BALL  
Than enjoy almsfood without virtue.⁹⁰

Better UNDONE is a wrong-doing.  
Better DONE is a well-doing.

Guard yourself like a border town—  
Inside and out.  
Don't let the moment pass.⁹¹

Wrong views lead to bad destiny.  
Right views lead to good destiny.

---

## Chapter 23: Nāgavagga (The Elephant)
### Train Yourself, Walk Alone If Needed

---

Like an elephant in battle  
Endures arrows from the bow—  
I will ENDURE abuse.⁹²

The TRAINED one is best among humans—  
The one who takes abuse and doesn't crack.

Noble are trained horses, elephants—  
But MORE noble is the self-trained one.⁹³

Dhanapālaka the elephant,  
Bound in captivity, won't eat.  
He REMEMBERS the elephant forest.⁹⁴

Formerly this mind wandered  
Wherever it wished to go.  
TODAY I will control it wisely.⁹⁵

Find a prudent friend?  
Travel together, glad and aware.  
Find no prudent friend?  
LIVE ALONE like a solitary elephant there.⁹⁶

Better to live alone than with fools.

---

## Chapter 24: Taṇhāvagga (Craving)
### The Creeper That Strangles

---

Craving grows like a creeper.  
You rush about like a monkey—  
Seeking fruit, never fed.⁹⁷

Overcome by craving?  
Griefs increase like grass after rain.  
Overcome craving itself?  
Griefs fall away—like water off lotus.⁹⁸

**DIG UP CRAVING'S ROOT!**  
If the root remains, suffering returns.

Iron bonds? Wood bonds?  
Those aren't the strong ones.  
The strong bond is attachment—  
To jewels, children, wives.  
CUT THIS and wander free.⁹⁹

**Be FREE of the past.  
Be FREE of the future.  
Be FREE of the present.**  
Cross over existence with mind liberated.¹⁰⁰

**The gift of Dhamma surpasses all gifts.  
The taste of Dhamma surpasses all tastes.  
The love of Dhamma surpasses all loves.  
Destruction of craving overcomes all suffering.**¹⁰¹

---

## Chapter 25: Bhikkhuvagga (The Monk)
### Restraint Everywhere Is Good

---

Restraint of eye is good.  
Restraint of ear is good.  
Restraint of nose is good.  
Restraint of tongue is good.  
Restraint of body is good.  
Restraint of speech is good.  
Restraint of mind is good.  
**Restraint everywhere is good.**¹⁰²

BAIL OUT THIS BOAT, monastic!  
Bailed out, it will go light.  
Cut off passion. Cut off hatred.  
Then Nibbāna comes in sight.¹⁰³

No concentration without wisdom.  
No wisdom without concentration.  
With BOTH—you're in Nibbāna's presence.¹⁰⁴

As jasmine casts off withered flowers—  
Cast off passion. Cast off hate.¹⁰⁵

Self is the protector of self.  
Self is the refuge of self.  
Restrain yourself like a merchant  
Restrains his noble horse.¹⁰⁶

---

## Chapter 26: Brāhmaṇavagga (The Brahmin)
### Not by Birth, But by Living

---

Strive and cut off the stream.  
Remove desire, brahmin.  
Know the destruction of the conditioned—  
Know the UNCONDITIONED within.¹⁰⁷

Not by matted hair. Not by family. Not by BIRTH  
Is one a brahmin.  
In whom is TRUTH and DHAMMA—  
THAT one is pure. THAT one is a brahmin.¹⁰⁸

I don't call one a brahmin just by birth.  
Having NOTHING, UNATTACHED—  
**That one I call a brahmin.**¹⁰⁹

Like water on a lotus leaf.  
Like mustard seed on a needle point.  
UNSMEARED by desires—  
**That one I call a brahmin.**¹¹⁰

Who has laid down the stick toward ALL beings,  
Who neither HURTS nor KILLS—  
**That one I call a brahmin.**¹¹¹

Friendly with the hostile.  
Calm among those holding sticks.  
Unattached among the attached—  
**That one I call a brahmin.**¹¹²

Like the moon—stainless, pure, clear—  
Destroyed joy in existence—  
**That one I call a brahmin.**¹¹³

Abandoning delight and aversion,  
Cooled off, free from cleaving,  
A HERO who vanquished the whole world—  
**That one I call a brahmin.**¹¹⁴

Knows former lives, sees heaven and downfall,  
Has attained birth's destruction,  
Accomplished in all accomplishments—  
**THAT ONE I CALL A BRAHMIN.**¹¹⁵

# ENDNOTES

¹ *Dhamma* here means all phenomena of experience. The Pali verse uses the image of a cart wheel following the ox—karma as psychological causation, not cosmic accounting.

² *Averena* (non-hatred) is the antidote. Not weakness, not "liking them anyway"—simply refusing to let hatred set up residence in your heart.

³ *Yamāmase*—"we are dying, we are perishing." Memento mori. This knowledge either makes you bitter or makes you free.

⁴ *Māra* is the Buddhist personification of death, delusion, and destruction. The "weak tree" represents lack of sense restraint (*asubha*).

⁵ *Vantakasāva*—"vomited out the defilements." Real spiritual work is internal, ugly, and sweaty. The outer sign means nothing without inner transformation.

⁶ *Sāra* (essence, heartwood) versus *asāra* (non-essence, sapwood). Most people never question what they were taught to want.

⁷ *Bhāvanā*—mental development, cultivation. This is Buddhism's core technology: building a roof for your mind.

⁸ Karma isn't punishment from above—it's the natural psychological consequence of your actions. Both immediate and long-term.

⁹ *Tappati* (burn) versus *nandati* (rejoice). Karma compounds—the initial consequence grows over time.

¹⁰ *Sāmaññassa bhāgavā*—"having a share in the spiritual life." Transformation beats information. Liberation beats erudition.

¹¹ *Amatapadaṁ* (the deathless state) versus *maccuno padaṁ* (death's domain). When truly awake to this moment, you're standing in the deathless.

¹² *Jhāyino sātatikā*—meditators who are constant. Not occasional practice but unbroken continuity breaks through.

¹³ *Dīpaṁ kayirātha*—"make an island." Nobody's gonna rescue you. Build your own refuge through your own effort.

¹⁴ *Paññāpāsāda*—palace of wisdom. This isn't arrogance; it's perspective. Wisdom gives you elevation and clear sight.

¹⁵ Maghavā (Sakka, Indra) practiced his way to divine kingship as a human. Even gods are made through effort.

¹⁶ Ten fetters (*saṁyojana*) burn away through insight's heat. *Abhabbo parihānāya*—there's a point of no return on this path.

¹⁷ *Usukāro va tejanaṁ*—like a fletcher with an arrow. The mind resists training; it panics when removed from habitual distractions.

¹⁸ Parallel structure of verses 35-36: restraint (*damatha*) and guarding (*gutta*) both lead to happiness (*sukhāvaha*).

¹⁹ Four qualities of mind: *dūraṅgama* (far-roaming), *ekacara* (wandering alone), *asarīra* (bodiless), *guhāsaya* (hidden in a cave—the heart).

²⁰ *Puññapāpapahīnassa*—having abandoned merit and demerit. Describes the arahat—beyond karma accumulation entirely.

²¹ *Kumbhūpama* (like a jar) for body; *nagarūpama* (like a fortress) for mind.

²² *Chuddho apetaviññāṇo*—rejected, without consciousness. The corpse is explicitly compared to useless wood.

²³ *Micchāpaṇihita citta* (wrongly-directed mind) is your worst enemy; *sammāpaṇihita citta* (rightly-directed mind) is your best friend.

²⁴ The *sekha* (trainee) is on the path but not yet arrived—still learning to see the teachings with trained discernment.

²⁵ Three images of insubstantiality: *pheṇūpama* (like froth), *marīcidhamma* (mirage-nature), *papupphakāni* (flower-adorned arrows of Māra).

²⁶ *Pupphāni pacinanta*—gathering flowers = chasing pleasures. Death comes before desire is ever satisfied.

²⁷ *Aheṭhayaṁ*—without harming. The sage on alms-round receives without depleting. Sustainable spiritual practice.

²⁸ *Na paresaṁ vilomāni*—not others' wrongs. The untrained mind loves judging others. Self-examination builds freedom.

²⁹ *Agandhakaṁ* (without fragrance) vs. *sagandhakaṁ* (with fragrance). Words without action = scentless flower.

³⁰ *Jātena maccena*—one born mortal. Limited time. The heap of flowers is our opportunities; the garlands are our good deeds.

³¹ *Sīlagandha* (virtue's fragrance) defies physics—spreads *paṭivātam* (against the wind), reaches the gods.

³² *Saṅkāradhāna* (garbage heap) becomes the ground for *paduma* (lotus). Awakening emerges FROM samsara, not despite it.

³³ *Dīgha* (long) repeats three times with increasing stakes: sleepless night → exhausting journey → endless rebirths.

³⁴ *Ekacariyaṁ daḷhaṁ kayirā*—firmly resolve to go alone. Better solitude than corrupting companionship.

³⁵ *Attā hi attano natthi*—even self is not one's own. If the "I" is impermanent, what can truly belong to it?

³⁶ *Paṇḍitamānī*—proud of wisdom, thinking oneself wise. The fool who believes himself wise cannot learn.

³⁷ *Dabbī sūparasaṁ yathā*—as a spoon the taste of curry. Despite constant immersion in wisdom, the fool never absorbs it.

³⁸ *Amitteneva attanā*—with themselves as enemy. Every wicked deed produces bitter fruit—and you're the one planting.

³⁹ *Madhuvā maññati*—thinks it sweet. Evil feels pleasurable before results manifest. Initial sweetness is deceptive.

⁴⁰ *Bhasmacchanno va pāvako*—fire covered with ashes. Karma's delayed action—quietly ripening, waiting to consume.

⁴¹ *Lābhūpanisā* (means to gains) versus *Nibbānagāminī* (path to Nibbāna). Two entirely different directions.

⁴² The wise one (*sujanena...vajjem*) points out faults like pointing out treasure. Follow correction; it leads to the better.

⁴³ *Kalyāṇamitte bhaja*—associate with spiritual friends. Companionship shapes the path.

⁴⁴ *Attānaṁ damayanti paṇḍitā*—the wise master themselves. The craftsman metaphor: shape yourself like raw material.

⁴⁵ *Selo yathā ekaghano*—as a solid rock. The wise remain unmoved by praise or blame.

⁴⁶ *Khīṇāsava*—pollutant-free. The arahat's journey is complete; all fetters abandoned.

⁴⁷ *Haṁsā va pallalaṁ hitvā*—like geese abandoning the lake. No attachment to any dwelling place.

⁴⁸ *Ākāse va sakuntānaṁ gati duttinuvāyayo*—the track of birds through the sky is hard to follow.

⁴⁹ *Sahassam api ce vācā anatthapadasaṁhitā*—though a thousand words, if they're meaningless.

⁵⁰ *Attā have jitaṁ seyyo*—conquest over self is better. Self-mastery trumps external victory.

⁵¹ *Abhittharetha kalyāṇe*—make haste toward the good. Urgency in practice.

⁵² *Udabindunipātena udakumbho pi pūrati*—drop by drop the water pot is filled. Karma accumulates.

⁵³ *Attānaṁ upamaṁ katvā*—comparing oneself with others. Buddhism's golden rule.

⁵⁴ *Kaṁso upahato*—broken gong. The practitioner who doesn't resound with anger has eliminated contention.

⁵⁵ *Ko nu hāso, kim ānando*—why laughter, why joy? The world *niccaṁ pajjalite* constantly burns with greed, hatred, delusion.

⁵⁶ *Aṭṭhīnaṁ nagara*—fortress of bones. Inner enemies (*jarā, maccu, māna, makkha*) hide within.

⁵⁷ *Gahakāraka diṭṭhosi*—O housebuilder, you are seen! The Buddha's enlightenment poem. *Taṇhā* (craving) is the housebuilder.

⁵⁸ *Attā hi attano nātho*—self is the friend/protector of self. Self-responsibility, not selfishness.

⁵⁹ *Vajiraṁ vasmamayaṁ maṇiṁ*—as a diamond crushes a rock-jewel. Self-generated karma crushes its creator.

⁶⁰ *Suddhī asuddhī paccattaṁ, nāñño aññaṁ visodhaye*—purity and impurity are one's own; no one can purify another.

⁶¹ *Bubbuḷaka* (bubble) and *marīcikā* (mirage)—classic impermanence images.

⁶² *Natthi saṅgo vijānataṁ*—no bond for those who understand. Insight liberates.

⁶³ *Abbhā mutto va candimā*—like moon released from cloud. Past heedlessness can be overcome.

⁶⁴ *Sotāpattiphalaṁ varaṁ*—stream-entry is better. First stage of enlightenment is worth more than world sovereignty.

⁶⁵ *Apada* (pathless, without track). The Buddha leaves no trace for others to follow back.

⁶⁶ *Kiccha* (rare)—human birth, mortal life, hearing Dhamma, Buddha's arising. "Four Rarities" teaching.

⁶⁷ *Sabbapāpassa akaraṇaṁ, kusalassa upasampadā, sacittapariyodapanaṁ*—the Ovāda Pāṭimokkha. Summary of all Buddha's teaching.

⁶⁸ The Triple Gem (*Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha*) with Four Noble Truths seen with *sammappaññāya* (right wisdom).

⁶⁹ *Susukhaṁ vata jīvāma*—we live truly happily. The famous refrain.

⁷⁰ *Upasanto sukhaṁ seti, hitvā jayapar#jaya*—the peaceful one lives happily, having abandoned victory and defeat.

⁷¹ *Natthi santiparaṁ sukhaṁ*—no happiness beyond peace. Core teaching of the chapter.

⁷² Five parallel verses tracing grief and fear to roots: *piya, pema, rati, kāma, taṇhā*—love, fondness, delight, desire, craving.

⁷³ *Rathaṁ bhantaṁ va dhāraye*—like controlling a swerving chariot. Only one who controls anger deserves the title *sārathi*.

⁷⁴ Four antidotes: *akkodhena, sādhunā, dānena, saccena*—non-anger, goodness, giving, truth.

⁷⁵ *Natthi loke anindito*—no one in the world is unblamed. The Atula teaching.

⁷⁶ *Kāya, vācā, mano*—body, speech, mind. Three channels through which anger expresses.

⁷⁷ *Dīpam-attano*—island for oneself. *Yamapurisā*—Yama's messengers.

⁷⁸ *Kammāro rajatasseva*—like a silversmith. Patient, gradual purification.

⁷⁹ As rust arises from iron and eats it away—stains arise from within and destroy their source.

⁸⁰ *Rāga* (passion) as fire, *dosa* (hatred) as seizure, *moha* (delusion) as snare, *taṇhā* (craving) as flood.

⁸¹ *Palitaṁ siro*—grey hair. Not about external age but internal qualities.

⁸² *Muṇḍakena*—shaven head. External marks don't make the spiritual person.

⁸³ *Vissāsa māpādi appatto āsavakkhayaṁ*—don't be confident until pollutants are destroyed.

⁸⁴ *Eso va maggo natthañño*—this is THE path, no other. *Tumhehi kiccaṁ ātappaṁ*—your duty is ardor.

⁸⁵ The Three Marks (*Ti-lakkhaṇa*): *anicca* (impermanent), *dukkha* (suffering), *anattā* (non-self).

⁸⁶ *Khippam-eva visodhaye*—quickly purify. Urgency.

⁸⁷ Six Recollections (*anussati*): Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha, Body, Non-violence, Cultivation.

⁸⁸ *Himavanto va pabbato*—like a snow-covered mountain. The good are visible from afar.

⁸⁹ *Kāsāvakaṇṭhā bahavo pāpadhammā*—many wearing the robe are wicked.

⁹¹ *Khaṇo vo mā upaccagā*—don't let the moment pass.
