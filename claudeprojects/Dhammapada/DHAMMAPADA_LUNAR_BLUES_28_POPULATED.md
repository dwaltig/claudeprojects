# INTRODUCTION: WALKING THE LUNAR PATH

## The Blues Truth About 28 Days

Listen here—this ain't no accident.

Twenty-eight chapters. Twenty-eight days. Twenty-eight Buddhas who came before.

The moon takes twenty-eight days to run its course—new to full to new again. The old monks knew that. They built this teaching to match the rhythm of the sky, the rhythm of your blood, the rhythm of the tide pulling at your bones.

One chapter a day. Start on the new moon when everything's dark and you can't see nothing. End twenty-eight days later when the moon comes back around and you're ready to start again.

## How to Walk This Path

**Day 1** (New Moon): Start with Chapter 1—the Pairs. Good and evil, light and dark, the choices you make.

**Day 7** (First Quarter): You're at Chapter 7—the Arahant. The ones who made it all the way.

**Day 14** (Full Moon): Middle of the month, middle of the journey—Chapter 14, the Buddha himself.

**Day 21** (Last Quarter): Three-quarters done—Chapter 21, the Path.

**Day 28** (New Moon): Final day—Chapter 28, the Brahmin. The holy person living free.

Then the moon goes dark and you start over. Every month, every cycle, walking the same path deeper and deeper until the truth gets all the way into your bones.

## The Four Uposatha Days

Four times in the lunar cycle, you stop and really pay attention:

- **New Moon** (Day 1 and Day 28): Endings and beginnings
- **First Quarter** (Day 7): Check your progress
- **Full Moon** (Day 14): Maximum light, maximum clarity
- **Last Quarter** (Day 21): Prepare for completion

On those days, you don't just read—you practice. You sit. You keep the precepts extra careful. You remember why you're walking this road.

# Chapter 12: Attavagga - Blues Edition
## The Self: Nobody Can Purify You But You

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

The self. Your best friend or your worst enemy. By yourself is evil done, by yourself are you defiled. By yourself is evil left undone, by yourself are you purified. Nobody—not mama, not a preacher, not a savior—can clean you up. That's the Buddha's radical truth: you do it yourself or it doesn't get done.

---

### Verses 157-160: Guard Yourself, Train Yourself

**The Blues Truth:**

If you love yourself, love yourself,  
Guard yourself right well.  
Watch through the night, watch through the night—  
The wise one stays alert.

First get yourself right, get yourself right,  
THEN teach somebody else.  
Train yourself first, train yourself first—  
Then you got something to help.

Self is hard to train, hard to train,  
But do yourself what you teach.  
Be what you preach, be what you preach—  
That's how the teaching can reach.

The self is the friend of self, friend of self—  
What other friend you got?  
When you train yourself well, train yourself well,  
You find a friend worth a lot.

**Blues Notes:** *Attā hi attano nātho* (self is the friend/protector of self). No one can do the work for you. The trained self becomes your own best companion.

---

### Verses 161-162: Evil Crushes Itself

**The Blues Truth:**

Evil done by yourself, by yourself,  
Born in you, rising in you—  
Crushes the fool, crushes the fool,  
Like diamond crushing through.

Like a vine on a Sāl tree, Sāl tree,  
Strangling what holds it up—  
Covering yourself with lack of virtue  
Makes you your enemy's pup.

You become what your enemy wants,  
You become what your enemy wants,  
When you strangle yourself with wrong.

**Blues Notes:** *Attanā va kataṁ pāpaṁ* (evil done by oneself) crushes oneself—no external enemy needed. The *māluvā* (strangling vine) kills its host tree: self-destruction through unvirtue.

---

### Verses 163-165: No One Can Purify Another

**The Blues Truth:**

Easy to do what's no good, no good,  
Easy to do what harms you.  
What's beneficial, what's right, what's true?  
THAT'S the hard thing to pursue.

Revile the teaching, mock the Dhamma,  
Laugh at those who live it true—  
You bring destruction on yourself  
Like bamboo when it fruits through.

BUT HERE'S THE TRUTH, THE DEEPEST TRUTH:

By yourself is evil done, evil done.  
By yourself are you defiled.  
By yourself is evil NOT done, NOT done.  
By yourself are you purified.

Purity and impurity—  
They come from YOU alone.  
No one can purify another.  
NO ONE CAN PURIFY ANOTHER.  
This work is yours to own.

**Blues Notes:** *Suddhī asuddhī paccattaṁ, nāñño aññaṁ visodhaye* (purity and impurity are one's own; no one can purify another). Buddhism's most radical ethical statement. No savior can do it for you.

---

### Verse 166: Know Your Own Good

**The Blues Truth:**

Don't neglect your own good, your own good,  
For another's, however great.  
Know what's good for you, good for you,  
Be intent on that estate.

Take care of yourself first, yourself first,  
So you can help somebody else.  
Not selfish—just wise.  
First put on your own mask.

**Blues Notes:** *Atta-d-atthaṁ paratthena na hāpaye* (don't neglect your own good for another's). Not selfishness—recognizing that without self-cultivation, you can't help others.

---

## End of Chapter 12: The Self

**What We Learned:**

1. If you love yourself, guard yourself
2. Train yourself FIRST, then teach others
3. Self is the friend of self—what other friend is there?
4. Self-done evil crushes like a diamond
5. Lack of virtue is a strangling vine
6. Easy to do what's wrong; hard to do what's right
7. BY YOURSELF is evil done, by yourself defiled
8. BY YOURSELF is evil NOT done, by yourself purified
9. NO ONE CAN PURIFY ANOTHER
10. Know your own good and pursue it

By yourself is the work done.  
By yourself is the freedom won.  
Nobody else, nobody else—  
You do it or it doesn't get done.

---

**Blues Notes on Translation Method:**

The Blues knows about self-reliance. Nobody's coming to save you. You pick yourself up off the floor, you face your demons, you do the work. The Buddha's teaching here matches exactly: *nāñño aññaṁ visodhaye*—no one can purify another. That's not cold; that's empowering. The power is in YOUR hands.

# Chapter 21: Pakiṇṇakavagga - Blues Edition
## Miscellaneous: Collected Jewels from the Road

---

## Opening Words

This chapter's called Miscellaneous, but don't let that fool you. These are COLLECTED JEWELS—the teachings that didn't fit neatly into other boxes but are too precious to leave out. Think of it like the wise old man's pockets: whatever he pulls out is something you need right now.

---

### Verse 290: Trade Up, Not Down

**The Blues Truth:**

If you gotta give up something small  
To get something large,  
Baby, make that trade.  
A wise one sees the big picture—  
Renounce the little good  
For the greater good ahead.

Don't clutch pennies when dollars are waiting.  
Don't hoard crumbs when the feast is set.  
The wise one knows when to let go  
Of what's holding them back.

**Blues Notes:** *Mattāsukhapariccāgā*—renouncing a small pleasure. This ain't about deprivation. It's about WISDOM. You give up the candy to get the meal. You give up the instant gratification for the lasting peace.

---

### Verse 291: Can't Build Happiness on Someone Else's Pain

**The Blues Truth:**

You want happiness for yourself  
By making someone else suffer?  
Listen here, friend—  
That's building your house on quicksand.

You get tangled up with hatred that way,  
And hatred don't let go easy.  
You think you're winning,  
But you're just binding yourself tighter  
To the very thing you hate.

Can't be free from hatred  
While still dealing in hatred's business.  
That's just math, baby.

**Blues Notes:** *Verasaṁsaggasaṁsaṭṭho*—associated with hatred. Buddha's saying cause and effect is RELENTLESS. Hurt others to help yourself, and you stay bound to that hurt.

---

### Verses 292-293: What Needs Doing vs. What Doesn't

**The Blues Truth:**

Here's how the pollutants GROW:  
You leave undone what needs doing,  
And do what doesn't need doing.  
Insolent. Heedless. Proud.  
Your spiritual pollution just keeps rising like floodwaters.

But here's how the pollutants DIE:  
Mindfulness of the body—keep it going.  
Don't practice what shouldn't be practiced.  
Persist in what SHOULD be done.  
Mindful. Fully aware.  
The pollutants settle down like mud in still water.

That's the choice every day, every hour—  
What am I feeding?  
The peace or the poison?

**Blues Notes:** *Āsavā* are the deep pollutants—things like sensual craving, craving for existence, and ignorance. They INCREASE with heedlessness and DECREASE with mindfulness. Simple equation, hard practice.

---

### Verses 294-295: The Riddle of Destroying Mother and Father

**The Blues Truth:**

Now this one sounds WILD—  
"Destroying mother and father,  
Two noble kings,  
A kingdom and its followers—  
The brahmin proceeds untroubled."

What?! The Buddha telling us to kill folks?  
NAH, baby. Listen deeper.

MOTHER is craving.  
FATHER is conceit.  
The TWO KINGS are eternalism and annihilationism—  
Wrong views on both sides.  
The KINGDOM is the sense-bases with their objects.  
The FOLLOWER is delight in attachment.

Destroy THOSE, and you walk free—  
Untroubled, unburdened, awake.

The second verse adds "a tiger as the fifth"—  
That's the five hindrances:  
Desire, ill-will, sloth, restlessness, doubt.  
Cut them down!

**Blues Notes:** This is classic Buddhist encryption—outrageous statements that reveal profound meaning when decoded. The Buddha wasn't advocating violence; he was using shock value to wake people up.

---

### Verses 296-301: The Six Recollections—Awake Well

**The Blues Truth:**

Gotama's disciples AWAKE WELL.  
What does that mean?  
Day and night, they keep mindfulness of:

**THE BUDDHA—**  
Remembering the Awakened One,  
His qualities, his path, his victory.  
That's verse 296.

**THE DHAMMA—**  
Remembering the Teaching,  
Visible here and now, inviting investigation,  
Leading onward for the wise.  
That's verse 297.

**THE SANGHA—**  
Remembering the Community,  
Practicing well, worthy of respect,  
Field of merit for the world.  
That's verse 298.

**THE BODY—**  
Remembering this body,  
Breath by breath, step by step,  
Knowing what's happening right now.  
That's verse 299.

**NON-VIOLENCE—**  
Delighting in harmlessness,  
At peace with all beings,  
No wish to hurt.  
That's verse 300.

**CULTIVATION—**  
Delighting in development,  
Growing the wholesome,  
Tending the garden of the mind.  
That's verse 301.

Six doors to waking well.  
Use them all, use them daily.  
THAT'S what Gotama's disciples do.

**Blues Notes:** *Suppabuddhaṁ pabujjhanti*—they awake to a good awakening. The Buddha is teaching HOW to wake up right. These six recollections are practical tools, not just devotional sentiments.

---

### Verse 302: Hard Either Way—Choose Your Hard

**The Blues Truth:**

Listen, going forth is HARD.  
Finding delight in renunciation? HARD.  
But living in households? ALSO HARD.  
Suffering alongside people different from you? HARD.  
Being a traveler in this round of births? HARD.  
Being affected by suffering? HARD.

So here's the thing—  
Life is hard either way.  
You gonna suffer at home,  
You gonna struggle on the path.

But one leads to freedom,  
And one keeps you spinning.

So don't be a traveler forever.  
Don't keep getting affected by suffering.  
CHOOSE the hard that leads somewhere.

**Blues Notes:** *Dukkhānupatitaddhagū*—travelers affected by suffering. The Buddha's not promising an easy road, but he IS pointing to the road that ends.

---

### Verse 303: The Faithful One Shines Everywhere

**The Blues Truth:**

You got faith?  
You got virtue?  
You got wealth and a good name?

Then wherever you go, baby,  
WHEREVER you go—  
You're honored right there and then.

This ain't about popularity.  
This is about INTEGRITY.  
When you're really walking the walk,  
People recognize it.  
It shines through.

**Blues Notes:** *Tattha tattheva pūjito*—right there and then he is worshipped. The Buddha's describing the natural magnetism of genuine virtue.

---

### Verse 304: The Good Shine Like Mountains

**The Blues Truth:**

THE GOOD shine from far away—  
Like the Himalayas covered in snow.  
You can see 'em from miles off.  
That brilliance can't be hidden.

But the WICKED?  
They're invisible here—  
Like arrows shot in the night.  
You don't see 'em till they hit.

So ask yourself:  
Am I a snow-capped mountain?  
Or an arrow in the dark?

**Blues Notes:** *Himavanto va pabbato*—like a snow-covered mountain. Himalaya literally means "abode of snow." The comparison is striking: goodness is VISIBLE, wickedness hides.

---

### Verse 305: The Solitary One at the Forest's Edge

**The Blues Truth:**

Sitting alone.  
Lying down alone.  
Walking alone.  
DILIGENT.

The solitary one who trains oneself—  
Ah, that one will find delight  
At the forest's edge.

Not lonely—ALONE.  
There's a difference.  
Lonely is empty.  
Alone is FULL.

The one who's really working on themselves,  
They don't need the crowd.  
They find peace in the quiet,  
Joy in the practice,  
Liberation in the solitude.

**Blues Notes:** *Vanante ramito siyā*—will delight in the edge of a forest. The "forest's edge" is both literal (a place for meditation) and metaphorical (the boundary between the conditioned world and Nibbāna).

---

## End of Chapter 21: Miscellaneous

**What We Learned:**

1. Trade small pleasures for greater good
2. Can't build happiness on others' suffering
3. Leave undone what shouldn't be done; persist in what should
4. "Mother and father" means craving and conceit—destroy THOSE
5. Six Recollections: Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha, Body, Non-violence, Cultivation
6. Life is hard either way—choose the hard that leads to freedom
7. The faithful, virtuous one is honored everywhere
8. The good shine like snow-capped mountains from afar
9. The wicked are invisible like arrows shot in darkness
10. The solitary, diligent one finds joy at the forest's edge

These are the collected jewels.  
Miscellaneous, maybe.  
But every one of them GOLD.

🙏

# THE CYCLE COMPLETES

Twenty-eight days. Twenty-eight chapters.

You walked from the Pairs to the Brahmin.
From duality to unity.
From "your mind writes the first verse" to "that one I call a brahmin."

The moon goes dark tonight.
Tomorrow it starts waxing again.
Tomorrow you start Chapter 1 again.

Every month, every cycle—
Walking the same path deeper,
Until the Dhamma gets all the way in,
Until freedom is the only thing left.

Don't do evil.
Do what's good.
Purify your mind.

That's it.
That's the teaching.
That's what every Buddha said.
