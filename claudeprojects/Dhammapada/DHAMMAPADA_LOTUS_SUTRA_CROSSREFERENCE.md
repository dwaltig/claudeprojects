# Dhammapada-Lotus Sutra Cross-Reference Study Guide

## Personal Study Notes: William Altig

*Connecting Theravada Wisdom (Dhammapada) with Mahayana Vision (Lotus Sutra)*

---

## Introduction

This study guide maps connections between the Dhammapada's 423 verses and the 28 chapters of the Lotus Sutra. While the Dhammapada represents early Pali Buddhism's concentrated ethical wisdom, the Lotus Sutra represents Mahayana Buddhism's expansive vision of universal Buddhahood. Together, they reveal Buddhism's full spectrum: from individual practice to cosmic truth.

**Key Thematic Bridges:**
- Mind as primary (Dhammapada 1-2) → All beings possess Buddha-nature (Lotus Sutra Ch. 2)
- Karma and causation → Expedient means and skillful adaptation
- Self-cultivation → Bodhisattva practice
- Liberation as personal goal → Universal enlightenment as cosmic destiny
