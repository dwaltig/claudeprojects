Pupphavaggo
4. The Chapter about Flowers
 
Kŏ imaṁ paṭhaviṁ vicessati
Who will know{56} this earth
 
yamalokañ-ca imaṁ sadevakaṁ?
and the lower realm,{57} together with the gods?{58} 
 
Ko dhammapadaṁ sudesitaṁ
Who (will reflect){59} on the well-taught verse of Dhamma
 
kusalo puppham-ivappacessati? [44]
as a good man reflects on a flower? 

Sekho paṭhaviṁ vicessati 
The trainee{60} will know this earth
 
yamalokañ-ca imaṁ sadevakaṁ.
and the lower realm, together with the gods.
 
Sekho dhammapadaṁ sudesitaṁ
The trainee (will reflect) on the well-taught verse of Dhamma
 
kusalo puppham-ivappacessati. [45]
as a good man reflects on a flower. 

Pheṇūpamaṁ kāyam-imaṁ viditvā,
Knowing that this body is just like froth,{61} 
 
marīcidhammaṁ abhisambudhāno,
understanding it has the nature of a mirage,{62} 
 
chetvāna Mārassa papupphakāni,
cutting off Māra&rsquo;s flower-tipped (arrows),{63}
 
adassanaṁ Maccurājassa gacche. [46]
one should go beyond the King of Death&rsquo;s sight.{64} 

Pupphāni heva pacinantaṁ byāsattamanasaṁ naraṁ, 
* Death takes up and carries away the one whose mind is attached to collecting flowers,{65} 
 
suttaṁ gāmaṁ mahogho va, maccu ādāya gacchati. [47]
like a great flood (carries off) a sleeping village. 

Pupphāni heva pacinantaṁ byāsattamanasaṁ naraṁ, 
* The End-Maker{66} takes control of the one whose mind is attached to collecting flowers,
 
atittaṁ yeva kāmesu Antako kurute vasaṁ. [48]
even though he is unsated with sense pleasures. 

Yathā pi bhamaro pupphaṁ vaṇṇagandhaṁ aheṭhayaṁ 
Just as a bee, without hurting the flower, its colour or scent, 
 
paḷeti rasam-ādāya, evaṁ gāme munī care. [49]
gathers its nectar and escapes,{67} so should the seer roam in the village. 

Na paresaṁ vilomāni, na paresaṁ katākataṁ
Not the wrongs of others, or what others have done or have not done 
 
attano va avekkheyya, katāni akatāni ca. [50]
one should consider, but what has been done and not done by oneself.{68} 

Yathā pi ruciraṁ pupphaṁ vaṇṇavantaṁ agandhakaṁ, 
Just like a beautiful flower, which has colour, but lacks fragrance,{69}
 
evaṁ subhāsitā vācā aphalā hoti akubbato. [51]
so are well-spoken words fruitless for the one who acts not (on them). 

Yathā pi ruciraṁ pupphaṁ vaṇṇavantaṁ sagandhakaṁ, 
Just like a beautiful flower, which has colour, and has fragrance,
 
evaṁ subhāsitā vācā saphalā hoti pakubbato. [52]
so are well-spoken words fruitful for the one who does act (on them). 

Yathā pi puppharāsimhā kayirā mālāguṇe bahū, 
Just as from a heap of flowers one might make a lot of garlands,
 
evaṁ jātena maccena kattabbaṁ kusalaṁ bahuṁ. [53]
so should many good deeds be done by one who is born a mortal. 

Na pupphagandho paṭivātam-eti, 
The fragrance of flowers goes not against the wind, 
 
na candanaṁ tagaramallikā vā, 
nor does sandalwood or pinwheel or white jasmine, 
 
satañ-ca gandho paṭivātam-eti, 
but the fragrance{70} of the good goes against the wind,
 
sabbā disā sappuriso pavāyati. [54]
the true person&rsquo;s (fragrance) permeates all directions. 

Candanaṁ tagaraṁ vā pi, uppalaṁ atha vassikī, 
Sandalwood, pinwheel, then water lily and striped jasmine,
 
etesaṁ gandhajātānaṁ sīlagandho anuttaro. [55]
amongst these kinds of fragrance virtue&rsquo;s fragrance is unsurpassed. 

Appamatto ayaṁ gandho yāyaṁ tagaracandanī, 
Pinwheel and sandalwood fragrance are insignificant,
 
yo ca sīlavataṁ gandho vāti devesu uttamo. [56]
but the fragrance of one who has virtue flutters{71} supreme amongst the gods. 

Tesaṁ sampannasīlānaṁ, appamādavihārinaṁ,
* Māra cannot find the path{72} of those endowed with virtue, who live heedfully, 
 
sammad-aññāvimuttānaṁ, Māro maggaṁ na vindati. [57]
and who are freed through complete and deep knowledge.{73} 

Yathā saṅkāradhānasmiṁ ujjhitasmiṁ mahāpathe
Just as in a forsaken and discarded heap along the highway
 
padumaṁ tattha jāyetha, sucigandhaṁ manoramaṁ, [58]
a lotus might arise{74} in that place, with a pure fragrance, delighting the mind, 
 
evaṁ saṅkārabhūtesu, andhabhūte puthujjane
* so amongst the forsaken, the Perfect Sambuddha&rsquo;s disciple
 
atirocati paññāya Sammāsambuddhasāvako. [59]
outshines the blind and ordinary folk through his wisdom.{75}

Vassikā viya pupphāni maddavāni pamuñcati, 
Just as striped jasmine casts off its withered flowers,
 
evaṁ rāgañ-ca dosañ-ca vippamuñcetha bhikkhavo. [377]
so, monastics, cast off (all) passion and hatred.
