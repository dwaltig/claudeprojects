Piyavaggo
16. The Chapter about Love
 
Ayoge yuñjam-attānaṁ, yogasmiñ-ca ayojayaṁ, 
Engaging oneself in what is not suitable, not engaging in what is suitable, 
 
atthaṁ hitvā piyaggāhī, pihetattānuyoginaṁ. [209]
abandoning the good, grasping the loved, he envies the one who endeavours for himself. 

Mā piyehi samāgañchī appiyehi kudācanaṁ, 
Do not associate at any time with those who are loved or with those unloved, 
 
piyānaṁ adassanaṁ dukkhaṁ, appiyānañ-ca dassanaṁ. [210]
there is suffering not meeting those loved, and (suffering from) meeting those unloved. 

Tasmā piyaṁ na kayirātha, piyāpāyo hi pāpako.
Therefore do not hold (anything) as loved, for losing those who are loved is loathsome.
 
Ganthā tesaṁ na vijjanti yesaṁ natthi piyāppiyaṁ. [211]
There are no knots for those who hold nothing as loved or as unloved. 

Piyato jāyatī soko, piyato jāyatī bhayaṁ, 
From love there arises grief, from love there arises fear,
 
piyato vippamuttassa natthi soko, kuto bhayaṁ? [212]
for one who is free from love there is no grief, how is there fear? 

Pemato jāyatī soko, pemato jāyatī bhayaṁ, 
From fondness there arises grief, from fondness there arises fear,
 
pemato vippamuttassa natthi soko, kuto bhayaṁ? [213]
for one who is free from fondness there is no grief, how is there fear? 

Ratiyā jāyatī soko, ratiyā jāyatī bhayaṁ, 
From delight there arises grief, from delight there arises fear,
 
ratiyā vippamuttassa natthi soko, kuto bhayaṁ? [214]
for one who is free from delight there is no grief, how is there fear? 

Kāmato jāyatī soko, kāmato jāyatī bhayaṁ, 
From desire there arises grief, from desire there arises fear,
 
kāmato vippamuttassa natthi soko, kuto bhayaṁ? [215]
for one who is free from desire there is no grief, how is there fear? 

Taṇhāya jāyatī soko, taṇhāya jāyatī bhayaṁ,
From craving there arises grief, from craving there arises fear,
 
taṇhāya vippamuttassa natthi soko, kuto bhayaṁ? [216]
for one who is free from craving there is no grief, how is there fear? 

Sīladassanasampannaṁ, dhammaṭṭhaṁ saccavedinaṁ,
Endowed with virtue and insight, principled, knowing the truths, 
 
attano kamma&rsquo; kubbānaṁ, taṁ jano kurute piyaṁ. [217]
doing the deeds{130} that are his own, that one the people love. 

Chandajāto anakkhāte, manasā ca phuṭo siyā, 
The one with desire arisen for the undeclared,{131} will be suffused with the (awakening) mind,{132} 
 
kāmesu ca appaṭibaddhacitto, &lsquo;uddhaṁsoto&rsquo; ti vuccati. [218]
with a mind unconnected with sense pleasures, he is spoken of as &lsquo;one gone upstream&rsquo;. 

Cirappavāsiṁ purisaṁ dūrato sotthim-āgataṁ, 
When one who lives abroad for a long time comes safely from afar,
 
ñātimittā suhajjā ca abhinandanti āgataṁ. [219]
his relatives, friends and companions come and greatly rejoice. 
 
Tatheva katapuññam-pi asmā lokā paraṁ gataṁ, 
Just so, when one who has performed merit goes from this world unto the next, 
 
puññāni paṭigaṇhanti piyaṁ ñātīva āgataṁ. [220]
his merits are received just as relatives come to their loved one.
