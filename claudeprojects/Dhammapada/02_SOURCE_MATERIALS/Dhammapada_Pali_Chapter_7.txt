Arahantavaggo
7. The Chapter about the Arahats
 
Gataddhino visokassa vippamuttassa sabbadhi, 
For the one who has reached his goal, who grieves not, being released on all sides, 
 
sabbaganthappahīnassa, pariḷāho na vijjati. [90]
who has abandoned all the knots,{93} no consuming fever{94} is found. 

Uyyuñjanti satīmanto na nikete ramanti te, 
The mindful ones who are striving do not delight in a dwelling, 
 
haṁsā va pallalaṁ hitvā, okam-okaṁ jahanti te. [91]
like geese who abandon a lake, they abandon fondness for homes.{95} 

Yesaṁ sannicayo natthi, ye pariññātabhojanā, 
For those who have no stores,{96} those who comprehend food aright,{97} 
 
suññato animitto ca vimokkho yesa&rsquo; gocaro,
for those whose resort is the liberation that is empty or signless,{98} 
 
ākāse va sakuntānaṁ, gati tesaṁ durannayā. [92]
like the birds in the sky, their track{99} is hard to find. 

Yassāsavā parikkhīṇā, āhāre ca anissito, 
For him whose pollutants are destroyed, who is not dependent on the foods,{100} 
 
suññato animitto ca vimokkho yassa gocaro,
for him whose resort is the liberation that is empty or signless,
 
ākāse va sakuntānaṁ, padaṁ tassa durannayaṁ. [93]
like the birds in the sky, his footprint{101} is hard to find. 

Yassindriyāni samathaṁ gatāni, 
For the one whose senses are stilled,
 
assā yathā sārathinā sudantā,
like horses well-trained by their charioteer, 
 
pahīnamānassa anāsavassa &ndash;
who has abandoned conceit, who is without pollutants &ndash;
 
devā pi tassa pihayanti tādino. [94]
even the gods envy such a one. 

Paṭhavisamo no virujjhati, 
One untroubled just like the earth,
 
indakhīlūpamŏ tādi subbato, 
steadfast just like a city-post, 
 
rahado va apetakaddamo &ndash; 
like a lake mud-free &ndash; 
 
saṁsārā na bhavanti tādino. [95]
such a one continues not in births and deaths. 

Santaṁ tassa manaṁ hoti, santā vācā ca kamma&rsquo; ca, 
His mind is calm, his speech and his actions are also calm,
 
sammad-aññāvimuttassa, upasantassa tādino. [96]
liberated by right knowledge, such a one is (truly) peaceful. 

Assaddho akataññū ca sandhicchedo ca yo naro, 
The person who is beyond (mere) faith,{102} who knows that which is unmade,{103} who has cut off (rebirth-)linking,{104} 
 
hatāvakāso vantāso, sa ve uttamaporiso. [97]
who has destroyed the occasion,{105} who has thrown out hope and desire,{106} is surely the person supreme. 

Gāme vā yadi vāraññe, ninne vā yadi vā thale, 
Whether in the village or wilds, whether on low or on high ground, 
 
yattharahanto viharanti, taṁ bhūmiṁ rāmaṇeyyakaṁ. [98]
wherever the Arahats live,{107} that ground is (surely) delightful. 

Ramaṇīyāni araññāni yattha na ramatī jano, 
The delightful wildernesses where the people do not delight, 
 
vītarāgā ramissanti, na te kāmagavesino. [99]
those without passion will take delight, (but) not those who seek sense pleasures.

being pollutant-free, an Arahat, that one I say is a brahmin.
