12. The Chapter about the Self
 
Attānañ-ce piyaṁ jaññā rakkheyya naṁ surakkhitaṁ,
If one regards oneself as dear one should guard oneself right well,
 
tiṇṇam-aññataraṁ yāmaṁ paṭijaggeyya paṇḍito. [157]
during one of the three watches (of the night) the wise one should stay alert.{117} 

Attānam-eva paṭhamaṁ patirūpe nivesaye, 
First one should establish oneself in what is suitable, 
 
athaññam-anusāseyya, na kilisseyya paṇḍito. [158]
then one can advise another, the wise one should not have (any) defilement. 

Attānañ-ce tathā kayirā yathaññam-anusāsati, 
He should do himself as he would advise another (to do),
 
sudanto vata dametha, attā hi kira duddamo. [159]
being well-trained, he could surely train (another), for it is said the self is difficult to 
train. 
 
Attā hi attano nātho, ko hi nātho paro siyā? 
For the self is the friend of self, for what other friend would there be? 
 
Attanā va sudantena nāthaṁ labhati dullabhaṁ. [160]
When the self is well-trained, one finds a friend that is hard to find. 

Attanā va kataṁ pāpaṁ, attajaṁ attasambhavaṁ, 
That wickedness done by oneself, born in oneself, arising in oneself, 
 
abhimatthati dummedhaṁ vajiraṁ vasmamayaṁ maṇiṁ. [161]
crushes the one who is stupid, as a diamond (crushes) a rock-jewel.{118} 

Yassa accantadussīlyaṁ, māluvā Sālam-ivotataṁ,
The one who is covered with an exceeding lack of virtue, like a deadly creeper on a Sal tree,
 
karoti so tathattānaṁ yathā naṁ icchatī diso. [162]
makes himself the same as his enemy wishes him to be. 

Sukarāni asādhūni, attano ahitāni ca,
Easily done are things not good, and unbeneficial for oneself,
 
yaṁ ve hitañ-ca sādhuñ-ca taṁ ve paramadukkaraṁ. [163]
but that which is beneficial and good is supremely hard to do. 

Yo sāsanaṁ arahataṁ Ariyānaṁ Dhammajīvinaṁ
* Whoever reviles the worthy teaching of the Noble Ones who live by Dhamma,
 
paṭikkosati dummedho diṭṭhiṁ nissāya pāpikaṁ,
that stupid one, depending on wicked views, 
 
phalāni kaṭṭhakasseva attaghaññāya phallati. [164]
like the bamboo when it bears fruit, brings about his own destruction.{119} 

Attanā va kataṁ pāpaṁ, attanā saṅkilissati, 
By oneself alone is a wicked deed done, by oneself is one defiled, 
 
attanā akataṁ pāpaṁ, attanā va visujjhati,
by oneself is a wicked deed left undone, by oneself is one purified, 
 
suddhī asuddhī paccattaṁ, nāñño aññaṁ visodhaye. [165]
purity and impurity come from oneself, (for) no one can purify another. 

Atta-d-atthaṁ paratthena bahunā pi na hāpaye; 
One should not neglect one&rsquo;s own good for another&rsquo;s, however great; 
 
atta-d-attham-abhiññāya sa-d-atthapasuto siyā. [166]
knowing what is good for oneself one should be intent on that good.
