### The Two Extremes & The Middle Way

**Pāli:**
> Dveme, bhikkhave, antā pabbajitena na sevitabbā. Katame dve? Yo cāyaṃ kāmesu kāmasukhallikānuyogo hīno gammo pothujjaniko anariyo anatthasaṃhito, yo cāyaṃ attakilamathānuyogo dukkho anariyo anatthasaṃhito. Ete kho, bhikkhave, ubho ante anupagamma majjhimā paṭipadā Tathāgatena abhisambuddhā cakkhukaraṇī ñāṇakaraṇī upasamāya abhiññāya sambodhāya nibbānāya saṃvattati.

**English:**
> These two extremes, bhikkhus, should not be adopted by one who has gone forth from the home life. Which two? On one hand, the devotion to hedonism towards kāma, which is inferior, vulgar, common, ignoble, deprived of benefit, and on the other hand the devotion to self-mortification, which is dukkha, ignoble, deprived of benefit. Without going to these two extremes, bhikkhus, the Tathāgata has fully awakened to the majjhima paṭipada (Middle Path), which produces vision, which produces ñāṇa, and leads to appeasement, to abhiñña, to sambodhi, to Nibbāna.

### The Noble Eightfold Path

**Pāli:**
> Katamā ca sā, bhikkhave, majjhimā paṭipadā Tathāgatena abhisambuddhā cakkhukaraṇī ñāṇakaraṇī upasamāya abhiññāya sambodhāya nibbānāya saṃvattati? Ayameva ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo, seyyathidaṃ: sammā·diṭṭhi, sammā·saṅkappo, sammā·vācā, sammā·kammanto, sammā·ājīvo, sammā·vāyāmo, sammā·sati, sammā·samādhi.

**English:**
> And what, bhikkhus, is the majjhima paṭipada to which the Tathāgata has fully awaken? It is, bhikkhus, this ariya aṭṭhaṅgika magga (Noble Eightfold Path), that is to say:
> 1. sammā·diṭṭhi (Right View)
> 2. sammā·saṅkappa (Right Intention)
> 3. sammā·vācā (Right Speech)
> 4. sammā·kammanta (Right Action)
> 5. sammā·ājīva (Right Livelihood)
> 6. sammā·vāyāma (Right Effort)
> 7. sammā·sati (Right Mindfulness)
> 8. sammā·samādhi (Right Concentration)

### The First Noble Truth: Dukkha (Suffering)

**Pāli:**
> Idaṃ kho pana, bhikkhave, dukkhaṃ ariyasaccaṃ: jātipi dukkhā, jarāpi dukkhā, byādhipi dukkho, maraṇampi dukkhaṃ, appiyehi sampayogo dukkho, piyehi vippayogo dukkho, yampicchaṃ na labhati tampi dukkhaṃ; saṃkhittena pañcupādānakkhandhā dukkhā.

**English:**
> Furthermore, bhikkhus, this is the dukkha ariyasacca: jāti (birth) is dukkha, jarā (aging) is dukkha, sickness is dukkha, maraṇa (death) is dukkha, association with what is disliked is dukkha, dissociation from what is liked is dukkha, not to get what one wants is dukkha; in short, the five upādānakkhandhas (aggregates of clinging) are dukkha.

### The Second Noble Truth: Samudaya (Origin of Suffering)

**Pāli:**
> Idaṃ kho pana, bhikkhave, dukkhasamudayaṃ ariyasaccaṃ: Yāyaṃ taṇhā ponobbhavikā nandirāgasahagatā tatratatrābhinandinī, seyyathidaṃ: kāmataṇhā, bhavataṇhā, vibhavataṇhā.

**English:**
> Furthermore, bhikkhus, this is the dukkha·samudaya ariyasacca: this taṇhā (craving) leading to rebirth, connected with desire and enjoyment, finding delight here or there, that is to say: kāma-taṇhā (craving for sensual pleasures), bhava-taṇhā (craving for existence), and vibhava-taṇhā (craving for non-existence).

---

### The Third Noble Truth: Nirodha (Cessation of Suffering)

**Pāli:**
> Idaṃ kho pana, bhikkhave, dukkhanirodhaṃ ariyasaccaṃ: yo tassāyeva taṇhāya asesavirāganirodho cāgo paṭinissaggo mutti anālayo.

**English:**
> Furthermore, bhikkhus, this is the dukkha·nirodha ariyasacca: the complete virāga (fading away), nirodha (cessation), abandoning, forsaking, emancipation and freedom from that very taṇhā.

---

### The Fourth Noble Truth: Magga (Path to Cessation)

**Pāli:**
> Idaṃ kho pana, bhikkhave, dukkhanirodhagāminī paṭipadā ariyasaccaṃ: ayameva ariyo aṭṭhaṅgiko maggo, seyyathidaṃ: sammā·diṭṭhi, sammā·saṅkappo, sammā·vācā, sammā·kammanto, sammā·ājīvo, sammā·vāyāmo, sammā·sati, sammā·samādhi.

**English:**
> Furthermore, bhikkhus, this is the dukkha·nirodha·gāminī paṭipada ariyasacca (the path leading to the cessation of suffering): just this ariya aṭṭhaṅgika magga, that is to say: sammā·diṭṭhi, sammā·saṅkappa, sammā·vācā, sammā·kammanta, sammā·ājīva, sammā·vāyāma, sammā·sati and sammā·samādhi.

### The Three Turnings of the Wheel

For each of the Four Noble Truths, the Buddha declares three aspects:
1. **Sacca-ñāṇa** — Knowledge of the truth ("This is...")
2. **Kicca-ñāṇa** — Knowledge of the task ("This should be...")
3. **Kata-ñāṇa** — Knowledge of accomplishment ("This has been...")

**Pāli (First Truth example):**
> 'Idaṃ dukkhaṃ ariyasacca' nti: me, bhikkhave, pubbe ananussutesu dhammesu cakkhuṃ udapādi, ñāṇaṃ udapādi, paññā udapādi, vijjā udapādi, āloko udapādi.

**English:**
> 'This is the dukkha ariyasacca': in me, bhikkhus, in regard to things unheard before, the eye arose, the ñāṇa arose, the paññā arose, the vijjā arose, the light arose.
