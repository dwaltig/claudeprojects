5. The Chapter about Fools
 
Dīghā jāgarato ratti, dīghaṁ santassa yojanaṁ,
Long is the night for one awake, long is a league for one tired, 
 
dīgho bālānaṁ saṁsāro Saddhammaṁ avijānataṁ. [60]
long is the round of births and deaths for fools who know not True Dhamma.{76} 

Carañ-ce nādhigaccheyya seyyaṁ sadisam-attano,
If while roaming one cannot find one better or the same as oneself,
 
ekacariyaṁ daḷhaṁ kayirā: natthi bāle sahāyatā. [61]
one should resolve to go alone: there is no friendship with fools.{77} 

&ldquo;Puttā matthi,{78} dhanam-matthi,&rdquo; iti bālo vihaññati, 
&ldquo;Sons are mine, riches are mine,&rdquo; so the fool suffers vexation,
 
attā hi attano natthi, kuto puttā, kuto dhanaṁ? [62]
when even self is not his own,{79} how then sons, how then riches? 

Yo bālo maññati bālyaṁ, paṇḍito vāpi tena so, 
The fool who knows (his) foolishness, is at least wise in that (matter),
 
bālo ca paṇḍitamānī, sa ve bālo ti vuccati. [63]
the fool who is proud of his wisdom, he is said to be a fool indeed. 

Yāvajīvam-pi ce bālo paṇḍitaṁ payirupāsati, 
Even if a fool attends on a wise man for his whole life long,
 
na so Dhammaṁ vijānāti, dabbī sūparasaṁ yathā. [64]
he does not learn Dhamma, just as spoon learns not the taste of curry. 

Muhuttam-api ce viññū paṇḍitaṁ payirupāsati, 
If a perceptive man attends on a wise man even for a second,
 
khippaṁ Dhammaṁ vijānāti, jivhā sūparasaṁ yathā. [65]
he quickly learns Dhamma, just as the tongue (learns) the taste of curry. 

Caranti bālā dummedhā amitteneva attanā, 
Stupid fools live having themselves as their own foes, 
 
karontā pāpakaṁ kammaṁ, yaṁ hoti kaṭukapphalaṁ. [66]
committing wicked deeds, which produce bitter fruit. 

Na taṁ kammaṁ kataṁ sādhu, yaṁ katvā anutappati, 
That deed is not well done, which, having done, one has regret,
 
yassa assumukho rodaṁ, vipākaṁ paṭisevati. [67]
for which he has tears on his face, as the result follows him round. 

Tañ-ca kammaṁ kataṁ sādhu, yaṁ katvā nānutappati, 
But that deed is well done, which, having done, one has no regret,
 
yassa patīto sumano, vipākaṁ paṭisevati. [68]
for which he is pleased and happy, as the result follows him round.{80} 

Madhuvā maññati bālo, yāva pāpaṁ na paccati,
The fool thinks it sweet, as long as the wicked deed does not ripen,
 
yadā ca paccati pāpaṁ, bālo dukkhaṁ nigacchati. [69]
but when the wicked deed ripens, the fool undergoes suffering. 

Māse māse kusaggena bālo bhuñjetha bhojanaṁ, 
From month to month the fool may eat food with the tip of kusa-grass,{81} 
 
na so saṅkhātadhammānaṁ kalaṁ agghati soḷasiṁ. [70]
(but) he is not worth a sixteenth part of those who have mastered Dhamma. 

Na hi pāpaṁ kataṁ kammaṁ, sajju khīraṁ va muccati,
A wicked deed that has been done, like milk, does not turn all at once,
 
ḍahantaṁ bālam-anveti, bhasmacchanno va pāvako. [71]
smouldering,{82} it follows the fool, like a fire covered with ashes.{83} 

Yāvad-eva anatthāya ñattaṁ bālassa jāyati, 
As far as learning arises for a fool, it is only to his disadvantage,
 
hanti bālassa sukkaṁsaṁ, muddham-assa vipātayaṁ. [72]
it destroys the fool&rsquo;s good fortune, and it will destroy his head.{84} 

Asataṁ bhāvanam-iccheyya, purekkhārañ-ca bhikkhusu, 
He may wish for the respect that is lacking, and status amongst the monastics, 
 
āvāsesu ca issariyaṁ, pūjā parakulesu ca: [73]
for control in the living quarters, and worship amongst good families: 
 
&ldquo;Mameva kata&rsquo; maññantu gihī pabbajitā ubho, 
&ldquo;Householders and renunciants should both think this was done by me,
 
mameva ativasā assu, kiccākiccesu kismici&rdquo;,
let them (all) be under my sway, in all to be done and not done&rdquo;,
 
iti bālassa saṅkappo, icchā māno ca vaḍḍhati. [74]
so does the fool think, (meanwhile) his desires and conceit increase. 

Aññā hi lābhūpanisā, aññā Nibbānagāminī, 
For the means to gains is one thing, the (path) going to Nibbāna another,
 
evam-etaṁ abhiññāya bhikkhu Buddhassa sāvako
thus knowing this the monastic disciple of the Buddha
 
sakkāraṁ nābhinandeyya, vivekam-anubrūhaye. [75]
should not delight in honours, (but) practise in solitude.{85}

The miserly go not to the world of the gods,

fools surely do not praise giving,
 
dhīro ca dānaṁ anumodamāno,
but the wise one rejoices in giving,

and through that he is happy hereafter. 

Sāhu dassanam-ariyānaṁ, sannivāso sadā sukho,

there is superhuman delight from insight into true Dhamma.
