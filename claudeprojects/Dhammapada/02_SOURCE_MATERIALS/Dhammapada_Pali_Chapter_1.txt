manasā ce paduṭṭhena bhāsati vā karoti vā,
if with a base mind one speaks or acts,
 
tato naṁ dukkham-anveti cakkaṁ va vahato{23} padaṁ. [1]

&ldquo;Akkocchi maṁ, avadhi maṁ, ajini maṁ, ahāsi me&rdquo;,
&ldquo;He abused me, he struck at me, he overcame me, he robbed me,&rdquo;{26}

&ldquo;Akkocchi maṁ, avadhi maṁ, ajini maṁ, ahāsi me&rdquo;,
&ldquo;He abused me, he struck at me, he overcame me, he robbed me,&rdquo;
 
ye taṁ na upanayhanti veraṁ tesūpasammati.{28} [4]
those who do not bear ill-will towards this their hatred is appeased. 

Na hi verena verāni sammantīdha kudācanaṁ,
For not by hatred do hatreds cease at any time in this place, 
 
averena ca sammanti, esa dhammo sanantano.{29} [5]
they only cease with non-hatred, this truth is (surely) eternal.{30} 
 
Pare ca na vijānanti mayam-ettha yamāmase,
The others do not understand that we should restrain ourselves here,
 
ye ca tattha vijānanti tato sammanti medhagā. [6]

Subhānupassiṁ viharantaṁ, indriyesu asaṁvutaṁ,
Living contemplating{32} what is pleasant, uncontrolled in sense faculties,
 
bhojanamhi amattaññuṁ, kusītaṁ hīnavīriyaṁ &ndash;
not knowing the limit in food, indolent, low in energy &ndash; 
 
taṁ ve pasahati Māro vāto rukkhaṁ va dubbalaṁ. [7]

taṁ ve nappasahati{33} Māro vāto selaṁ va pabbataṁ. [8]
Māra does not overthrow that one, just as wind does not (overthrow) a mountain made of 
rock.

Yo ca vantakasāvassa, sīlesu susamāhito,{35}
The one who, steady in virtue, throws out (any) impurity, 
 
upeto damasaccena sa ve kāsāvam-arahati. [10]
endowed with restraint and truth, is indeed worthy of the renunciant&rsquo;s robe. 

Asāre sāramatino, sāre cāsāradassino,{36}

te sāraṁ nādhigacchanti, micchāsaṅkappagocarā. [11]

Yathā agāraṁ ducchannaṁ vuṭṭhī samativijjhati,
Just as the rain penetrates a house with thatching that is poor,
 
evaṁ abhāvitaṁ cittaṁ rāgo samativijjhati. [13]
so passion penetrates a mind that is undeveloped. 
 
Yathā agāraṁ succhannaṁ vuṭṭhī na samativijjhati,
Just as rain does not penetrate a house with thatching that is good,
 
evaṁ subhāvitaṁ cittaṁ rāgo na samativijjhati. [14]

Bahum-pi ce sahitaṁ{43} bhāsamāno,
Even though reciting abundant scriptures,
 
na takkaro{44} hoti naro pamatto,
the heedless fellow, who does not do (what they say),

anupādiyāno idha vā huraṁ vā,
that one, unattached here and hereafter,
 
sa bhāgavā sāmaññassa hoti. [20]
(surely) partakes of the ascetic life.
