13. The Chapter about the World
 
Hīnaṁ dhammaṁ na seveyya, pamādena na saṁvase, 
One should not follow lowly things,{120} one should not abide heedlessly,
 
micchādiṭṭhiṁ na seveyya, na siyā lokavaḍḍhano. [167]
one should not follow a wrong view, one should not foster worldliness. 

Uttiṭṭhe nappamajjeyya, Dhammaṁ sucaritaṁ care, 
One should strive, not be heedless, one should live by Dhamma, with good conduct, 
 
Dhammacārī sukhaṁ seti asmiṁ loke paramhi ca. [168]
living by Dhamma one lives at ease in this world and the next. 

Dhammaṁ care sucaritaṁ, na naṁ duccaritaṁ care, 
One should live by Dhamma, with good conduct, not with bad conduct, 
 
Dhammacārī sukhaṁ seti asmiṁ loke paramhi ca. [169]
living by Dhamma one lives at ease in this world and the next. 

Yathā bubbulakaṁ passe, yathā passe marīcikaṁ, 
One should see it as a bubble, one should see it as a mirage,
 
evaṁ lokaṁ avekkhantaṁ Maccurājā na passati. [170]
looking on the world in this way the King of Death does not see (one). 

Etha passathimaṁ lokaṁ cittaṁ rājarathūpamaṁ,
Come, look upon this world adorned like a king&rsquo;s gilded chariot, 
 
yattha bālā visīdanti &ndash; natthi saṅgo vijānataṁ. [171]
where fools become depressed &ndash; there is no bond for those who understand. 

Yo ca pubbe pamajjitvā, pacchā so nappamajjati, 
Whoever was heedless before, but later is not heedless, 
 
sŏ imaṁ lokaṁ pabhāseti abbhā mutto va candimā. [172]
that one shines brightly on this world like the moon released from a cloud. 

Yassa pāpaṁ kataṁ kammaṁ kusalena pithīyati &ndash;
The one whose wicked deed is covered over by a good deed &ndash;
 
sŏ imaṁ lokaṁ pabhāseti abbhā mutto va candimā. [173]
that one shines brightly on this world like the moon released from a cloud. 

Andhabhūto ayaṁ loko, tanukettha vipassati, 
This world is blind, few here have true insight, 
 
sakunto jālamutto va appo saggāya gacchati. [174]
as few go to heaven as birds that escape from the net. 

Haṁsādiccapathe yanti, ākāse yanti iddhiyā, 
Geese go through the path of the sky, they go through the firmament by their power, 
 
nīyanti dhīrā lokamhā, jetvā Māraṁ savāhanaṁ. [175]
the wise are led out of the world, after beating Māra and his host. 

Ekaṁ dhammaṁ atītassa, musāvādissa jantuno,
For the person speaking falsely, who has transgressed in this one thing, 
 
vitiṇṇaparalokassa, natthi pāpaṁ akāriyaṁ. [176]
who has abandoned the next world, there is no wickedness left undone. 

Na ve kadariyā devalokaṁ vajanti, 
The miserly go not to the world of the gods,
 
bālā have nappasaṁsanti dānaṁ,
fools surely do not praise giving,
 
dhīro ca dānaṁ anumodamāno,
but the wise one rejoices in giving,
 
teneva so hoti sukhī parattha. [177]
and through that he is happy hereafter. 

Pathavyā ekarajjena, saggassa gamanena vā, 
Having sole sovereignty over the earth, or going to heaven,
 
sabbalokādhipaccena{121} &ndash; sotāpattiphalaṁ varaṁ. [178]
or lordship over the whole world &ndash; better is the fruit of stream-entry.
