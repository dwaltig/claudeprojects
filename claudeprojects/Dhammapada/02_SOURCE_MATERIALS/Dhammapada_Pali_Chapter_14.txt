Buddhavaggo
14. The Chapter about the Buddha
 
Yassa jitaṁ nāvajīyati, 
He whose victory cannot be undone, 
 
jitaṁ assa no yāti koci loke, 
whose victory no one here approaches, 
 
tam-Buddham-anantagocaraṁ,
the Buddha, whose range is endless, 
 
apadaṁ kena padena nessatha? [179]
by what path can you lead the pathless one? 

Yassa jālinī visattikā,
* For him there is no desire, attachment,
 
taṇhā natthi kuhiñci netave, 
or craving to lead (him) anywhere,{122}
 
tam-Buddham-anantagocaraṁ,
the Buddha, whose range is endless, 
 
apadaṁ kena padena nessatha? [180]
by what path can you lead the pathless one? 

Ye jhānapasutā dhīrā, nekkhammūpasame ratā, 
Those wise ones intent on meditation,{123} who delight in the peace of renunciation, 
 
devā pi tesaṁ pihayanti, Sambuddhānaṁ satīmataṁ. [181]
even the gods are envious of them, the Sambuddhas, the ones who are mindful. 

Kiccho manussapaṭilābho, kicchaṁ maccāna&rsquo; jīvitaṁ,
It is rare to acquire (birth as a) human, rare is the life of mortals, 
 
kicchaṁ Saddhammasavanaṁ, kiccho Buddhānam-uppādo. [182]
it is rare to hear the True Dhamma, rare the arising of Buddhas. 

Sabbapāpassa akaraṇaṁ, kusalassa upasampadā, 
The non-doing of anything wicked, undertaking of what is good, 
 
sacittapariyodapanaṁ - etaṁ Buddhāna&rsquo; sāsanaṁ. [183]
the purification of one&rsquo;s mind - this is the teaching of the Buddhas. 

Khantī paramaṁ tapo titikkhā, 
Enduring patience is the supreme austerity,
 
Nibbānaṁ paramaṁ vadanti Buddhā,
Nibbāna is supreme say the Buddhas,
 
na hi pabbajito parūpaghātī,
for one gone forth does not hurt another,
 
samaṇo hoti paraṁ viheṭhayanto. [184]
(nor does) an ascetic harass another. 

Anupavādo anupaghāto, pātimokkhe ca saṁvaro, 
Not finding fault, not hurting, restraint by the regulations,
 
mattaññutā ca bhattasmiṁ, pantañ-ca sayanāsanaṁ,
knowing the right measure of food, (living in) a remote dwelling,
 
adhicitte ca āyogo - etaṁ Buddhāna&rsquo; sāsanaṁ. [185]
devotion to meditation - this is the teaching of the Buddhas. 

Na kahāpaṇavassena titti kāmesu vijjati, 
Not through a rain of coins is satisfaction found for sense desires, 
 
&ldquo;Appassādā dukhā kāmā,&rdquo; iti viññāya paṇḍito, [186]
the wise one knowing: &ldquo;Sense pleasures have little joy, (much) suffering,&rdquo; 
 
api dibbesu kāmesu ratiṁ so nādhigacchati. 
does not find delight even in heavenly pleasures. 
 
Taṇhakkhayarato hoti Sammāsambuddhasāvako. [187]
The disciple of the Perfect Sambuddha delights in craving&rsquo;s destruction. 

Bahuṁ ve saraṇaṁ yanti pabbatāni vanāni ca 
* Many people shaken by fear go for refuge 
 
ārāmarukkhacetyāni, manussā bhayatajjitā. [188]
to woods and mountains, to tree shrines in pleasure parks. 

Netaṁ kho saraṇaṁ khemaṁ, netaṁ saraṇam-uttamaṁ,
That is not a secure refuge, that is not the refuge supreme, 
 
netaṁ saraṇam-āgamma sabbadukkhā pamuccati. [189]
that is not the refuge to come to that liberates from all suffering. 

Yo ca Buddhañ-ca Dhammañ-ca Saṅghañ-ca saraṇaṁ gato, 
Whoever has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma and the Saṅgha,
 
cattāri ariyasaccāni sammappaññāya passati: [190]
and who sees with right wisdom the four noble truths: 
 
Dukkhaṁ dukkhasamuppādaṁ dukkhassa ca atikkamaṁ, 
Suffering, arising of suffering, and the overcoming of suffering,
 
ariyañ-caṭṭhaṅgikaṁ maggaṁ dukkhūpasamagāminaṁ. [191]
the eightfold noble path leading to the stilling of suffering. 
 
Etaṁ kho saraṇaṁ khemaṁ, etaṁ saraṇam-uttamaṁ, 
That is a secure refuge, that is the refuge supreme, 
 
etaṁ saraṇam-āgamma sabbadukkhā pamuccati. [192]
that is the refuge to come to that liberates from all suffering. 

Dullabho purisājañño, na so sabbattha jāyati,
A person of good breed is rare, that one is not born everywhere,
 
yattha so jāyate dhīro, taṁ kulaṁ sukham-edhati. [193]
wherever that wise one is born, that family gains happiness. 

Sukho Buddhānam-uppādo, sukhā Saddhammadesanā,
The arising of the Buddhas is good, the teaching of the True Dhamma is good,
 
sukhā Saṅghassa sāmaggī, samaggānaṁ tapo sukho. [194]
the harmony of the Saṅgha is good, devotion to harmony is good. 

Pūjārahe pūjayato, Buddhe yadi va sāvake, 
For those who worship those worthy of worship, whether Buddhas or disciples, 
 
papañcasamatikkante, tiṇṇasokapariddave; [195]
who have overcome the impediments, crossed over grief and lamentation; 

te tādise pūjayato, nibbute akutobhaye, 
for those who worship such as these, the emancipated, the fearless,
 
na sakkā puññaṁ saṅkhātuṁ, imettam-api kenaci. [196]
no one is able to measure their (vast) merit, (saying:) it is as much as this.
