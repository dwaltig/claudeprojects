3. The Chapter about the Mind
 
Phandanaṁ capalaṁ cittaṁ,{49} dūrakkhaṁ dunnivārayaṁ,
An agitated, unsteady mind, difficult to guard, difficult to ward, 
 
ujuṁ karoti medhāvī, usukāro va tejanaṁ. [33]
the sagacious one makes straight, as a fletcher does his arrow. 

Vārijo va thale khitto, oka-m-okata ubbhato,
Like a fish thrown up on dry land, pulled out from its watery home,{50} 
 
pariphandatidaṁ cittaṁ, Māradheyyaṁ pahātave. [34]
the mind is agitated, (one ought) to throw off the sway of Māra.{51} 

Dunniggahassa lahuno yatthakāmanipātino,
* For the mind that is difficult to subdue, flighty, flitting wherever it will,
 
cittassa damatho sādhu, cittaṁ dantaṁ sukhāvahaṁ. [35]
restraint is good, a restrained mind brings happiness. 

Sududdasaṁ sunipuṇaṁ yatthakāmanipātinaṁ,
Hard to see, very subtle, flitting wherever it will,
 
cittaṁ rakkhetha medhāvī, cittaṁ guttaṁ sukhāvahaṁ. [36]
the sage should guard the mind, a guarded mind brings happiness. 

Dūraṅgamaṁ ekacaraṁ, asarīraṁ guhāsayaṁ, 
* Those who will restrain the mind that roams far, 
 
ye cittaṁ saññam-essanti, mokkhanti Mārabandhanā. [37]
is lonesome, without a body, hidden, gain release from the bonds of Māra. 

Anavaṭṭhitacittassa, Saddhammaṁ avijānato,
For the one with unsettled mind, who does not know the True Dhamma,
 
pariplavapasādassa, paññā na paripūrati. [38]
whose confidence is wavering, wisdom is unfulfilled. 

Anavassutacittassa, ananvāhatacetaso,
For the one with mind free of lust, for the one with mind unperplexed, 
 
puññapāpapahīnassa natthi jāgarato bhayaṁ. [39]
for the one who has abandoned making merit and demerit, for the watchful, there is no fear. 

Kumbhūpamaṁ kāyam-imaṁ viditvā, 
Knowing this body is (frail) like a jar,
 
nagarūpamaṁ cittam-idaṁ ṭhapetvā,
establishing the mind like a fortress,{52}
 
yodhetha Māraṁ paññāvudhena, 
fight Māra with the weapon of wisdom,
 
jitañ-ca rakkhe, anivesano siyā. [40]
guard your success, and do not be attached.{53} 

Aciraṁ vatayaṁ kāyo paṭhaviṁ adhisessati, 
Before long has passed by, alas, this body will lie on the ground,{54} 
 
chuddho apetaviññāṇo, niratthaṁ va kaliṅgaraṁ. [41]
rejected, without consciousness, just like a useless piece of wood. 

Diso disaṁ yan-taṁ kayirā, verī vā pana verinaṁ &ndash;
Whatever an aggressor might do to an aggressor, or an enemy to an enemy &ndash;
 
micchāpaṇihitaṁ cittaṁ pāpiyo naṁ tato kare. [42]
a mind that is badly-directed can do far worse than that to him. 

Na taṁ{55} mātā pitā kayirā, aññe vā pi ca ñātakā,
Mother and father might not do for him, or other relatives,
 
sammāpaṇihitaṁ cittaṁ seyyaso naṁ tato kare. [43]
as much good as a mind that is well-directed can do for him.
