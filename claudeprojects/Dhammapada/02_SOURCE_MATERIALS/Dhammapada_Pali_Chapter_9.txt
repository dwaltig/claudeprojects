9. The Chapter about Wickedness
 
Abhittharetha kalyāṇe, pāpā cittaṁ nivāraye, 
Hasten to do wholesome deeds, ward off the mind from wickedness,
 
dandhaṁ hi karato puññaṁ pāpasmiṁ ramatī mano. [116]
for the mind of the one slow in merit delights in wickedness. 

Pāpañ-ce puriso kayirā, na taṁ kayirā punappunaṁ, 
Should a person do that which is wicked, he should not do it again and again,
 
na tamhi chandaṁ kayirātha, dukkho pāpassa uccayo. [117]
let him not place his intention in it, (for) there is an accumulation of suffering for the wicked one. 
 
Puññañ-ce puriso kayirā, kayirāthetaṁ punappunaṁ, 
If a person should make merit, he should do it again and again,
 
tamhi chandaṁ kayirātha, sukho puññassa uccayo. [118]
let him place his intention there, there is an increase of joy for the one who has made merit. 
 
Pāpo pi passati bhadraṁ yāva pāpaṁ na paccati, 
Even the wicked one experiences good fortune while the wickedness does not ripen,
 
yadā ca paccati pāpaṁ atha pāpo pāpāni passati. [119]
but when the wickedness ripens then the wicked one experiences wicked things. 

Bhadro pi passati pāpaṁ yāva bhadraṁ na paccati, 
Even the fortunate one experiences wickedness as long as the good fortune does not ripen,
 
yadā ca paccati bhadraṁ atha bhadro bhadrāni passati. [120]
but when the fortune ripens then the fortunate one experiences good fortune. 

Māppamaññetha pāpassa: na maṁ taṁ āgamissati,
One should not despise a wickedness (thinking): it will not come to me,
 
udabindunipātena udakumbho pi pūrati,
through the falling of water drops the water-pot is (quickly) filled,
 
bālo pūrati pāpassa, thokaṁ thokam-pi ācinaṁ. [121]
the fool, gathering bit by bit, becomes full of wickedness. 

Māppamaññetha puññassa: na maṁ taṁ āgamissati. 
One should not despise merit (thinking): it will not come to me,
 
udabindunipātena udakumbho pi pūrati,
through the falling of water drops the water-pot is (quickly) filled,
 
dhīro pūrati puññassa, thokathokam-pi ācinaṁ. [122]
the wise one, gathering bit by bit, becomes full of merit. 

Vāṇijo va bhayaṁ maggaṁ, appasattho mahaddhano,
Like a merchant on a fearful path, with few friends and great wealth,
 
visaṁ jīvitukāmo va, pāpāni parivajjaye. [123]
as one loving life (would avoid) poison, (so) should one avoid wicked deeds. 

Pāṇimhi ce vaṇo nāssa hareyya pāṇinā visaṁ, 
If there is no wound in his hand he can carry poison with his hand,
 
nābbaṇaṁ visam-anveti, natthi pāpaṁ akubbato. [124]
poison does not enter without a wound, there is no bad result for the one who does no (wrong).

So appaduṭṭhassa narassa dussati,
One offends against the inoffensive one,
 
suddhassa posassa anaṅgaṇassa,
a purified and passionless person,
 
tam-eva bālaṁ pacceti pāpaṁ,
that wicked deed (then) returns to the fool,
 
sukhumo rajo paṭivātaṁ va khitto. [125]
like fine dust that is thrown against the wind. 

Gabbham-eke &rsquo;papajjanti, nirayaṁ pāpakammino, 
Some are reborn in the womb, (but) those who are wicked in the underworld,
 
saggaṁ sugatino yanti, parinibbanti anāsavā. [126]
the righteous go to heaven, those who are pollutant-free are emancipated. 

Na antalikkhe, na samuddamajjhe,
Neither in the sky, nor in the middle of the ocean,
 
na pabbatānaṁ vivaraṁ pavissa:
nor after entering a mountain cleft:
 
na vijjatī so jagatippadeso
there is no place found on this earth
 
yatthaṭṭhito mucceyya pāpakammā. [127]
where one can be free from (the results of) wicked deeds. 

Na antalikkhe, na samuddamajjhe,
Neither in the sky, nor in the middle of the ocean,
 
na pabbatānaṁ vivaraṁ pavissa:
nor after entering a mountain cleft:
 
na vijjatī so jagatippadeso,
there is no place found on this earth, 
 
yatthaṭṭhitaṁ nappasahetha maccu. [128]
in which death does not overcome one.
