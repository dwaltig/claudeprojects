26. The Chapter about Brahmins
 
Chinda sotaṁ parakkamma, kāme panuda, brāhmaṇa, 
Strive and cut off the stream, remove desire, brahmin, 
 
saṅkhārānaṁ khayaṁ ñatvā, akataññūsi, brāhmaṇa. [383]
knowing the destruction of the conditioned, be one who knows that which is not made,{175} 
brahmin. 
 
Yadā dvayesu dhammesu pāragū hoti brāhmaṇo, 
When a brahmin has, through two things,{176} crossed over,
 
athassa sabbe saṁyogā atthaṁ gacchanti jānato. [384]
then, for one who knows, all the fetters are laid to rest. 

Yassa pāraṁ apāraṁ vā pārāpāraṁ na vijjati, 
For whom the near shore, the far shore or both do not exist, 
 
vītaddaraṁ visaṁyuttaṁ, tam-ahaṁ brūmi brāhmaṇaṁ. [385]
free of anxiety, being detached, that one I say is a brahmin. 

Jhāyiṁ virajam-āsīnaṁ, katakiccaṁ anāsavaṁ, 
The meditator sitting down, the one who is dustless, who has done his duty, without pollutants, 
 
uttamatthaṁ anuppattaṁ, tam-ahaṁ brūmi brāhmaṇaṁ. [386]
who has reached the ultimate good, that one I say is a brahmin. 

Divā tapati ādicco, rattiṁ ābhāti candimā, 
The sun is radiant by day, the moon shines by night, 
 
sannaddho khattiyo tapati, jhāyī tapati brāhmaṇo,
the accoutred noble is radiant, the meditating brahmin is radiant, 
 
atha sabbam-ahorattiṁ Buddho tapati tejasā. [387]
yet every day and night the Buddha is radiant through his power. 

Bāhitapāpo ti brāhmaṇo,
Warding off wickedness one is called a brahmin, 
 
samacariyā samaṇo ti vuccati, 
one living austerely is said to be an ascetic,
 
pabbājayam-attano malaṁ
* because of driving forth (all) stain from oneself 
 
tasmā pabbajito ti vuccati. [388]
one is said to be one who has gone forth.{177} 

Na brāhmaṇassa pahareyya, nāssa muñcetha brāhmaṇo, 
A brahmin should not hit a brahmin, nor should he abandon him,
 
dhī brāhmaṇassa hantāraṁ, tato: dhī yassa muñcati. [389]
woe to one who strikes a brahmin, further: woe to one who lets fly. 

Na brāhmaṇass&rsquo; etad-akiñci seyyo:
It is no little good for the brahmin:
 
yadā nisedho manaso piyehi,
when the mind is held back from what is dear, 
 
yato yato hiṁsamano nivattati,
whenever his mind turns back from violence, 
 
tato tato sammati-m-eva dukkhaṁ. [390]

Na jaṭāhi na gottena, na jaccā hoti brāhmaṇo, 
Not because of matted hair, family or birth is one a true brahmin, 
 
yamhi saccañ-ca Dhammo ca, so sucī so va brāhmaṇo. [393]
in whom there is truth and Dhamma, that one is pure, that one is surely a brahmin. 

Kiṁ te jaṭāhi dummedha, kiṁ te ajinasāṭiyā?
Why do you have your hair matted, stupid one, and why your deer-skin?

Na cāhaṁ brāhmaṇaṁ brūmi yonijaṁ mattisambhavaṁ, 
I do not call one a brahmin simply because of being born from a (certain) womb,{181} 
 
bhovādī nāma so hoti sace hoti sakiñcano;
that one is just one who says &lsquo;bho&rsquo;{182} if he is attached; 
 
akiñcanaṁ anādānaṁ, tam-ahaṁ brūmi brāhmaṇaṁ. [396]
