17. The Chapter about Anger
 
Kodhaṁ jahe, vippajaheyya mānaṁ, 
One should abandon anger, one should abandon conceit,
 
saṁyojanaṁ sabbam-atikkameyya,
one should overcome every fetter, 
 
taṁ nāmarūpasmiṁ asajjamānaṁ,
without clinging to mind and bodily form,
 
akiñcanaṁ nānupatanti dukkhā. [221]
sufferings never do befall the one having no possessions.{133} 

Yo ve uppatitaṁ kodhaṁ rathaṁ bhantaṁ va dhāraye,
Whoever should hold back arisen anger just like a swerving chariot, 
 
tam-ahaṁ sārathiṁ brūmi rasmiggāho itaro jano. [222]
that one I say is a charioteer, other people are just rein-holders. 

Akkodhena jine kodhaṁ, asādhuṁ sādhunā jine,
Through kindness{134} one should overcome anger, through goodness one should overcome a lack of goodness, 
 
jine kadariyaṁ dānena, saccenālikavādinaṁ. [223]
through gifts one should overcome stinginess, through truth (one should overcome) lying 
speech. 
 
Saccaṁ bhaṇe, na kujjheyya, dajjāppasmim-pi yācito, 
One should speak out the truth, one should not get angry, when requested give, if only a little, 
 
etehi tīhi ṭhānehi gacche devāna&rsquo; santike. [224]
through these three conditions one can go to the presence of the gods. 

Ahiṁsakā ye munayo, niccaṁ kāyena saṁvutā, 
Those sages without violence, constantly restrained in body, 
 
te yanti accutaṁ ṭhānaṁ, yattha gantvā na socare. [225]
go to the deathless (Nibbāna), having gone there they do not grieve. 

Sadā jāgaramānānaṁ, ahorattānusikkhinaṁ, 
For those who are always wakeful, who train both by day and by night,
 
Nibbānaṁ adhimuttānaṁ, atthaṁ gacchanti āsavā. [226]
who are intent on Nibbāna, the pollutants are laid to rest. 

Porāṇam-etaṁ, Atula, netaṁ ajjatanām-iva:
This is something of old, Atula, this is not something of today:
 
nindanti tuṇhim-āsīnaṁ, nindanti bahubhāṇinaṁ,
they blame the one who sits silently, they blame the one who talks a lot,
 
mitabhāṇim-pi nindanti, natthi loke anindito. [227]
they blame the one who talks in moderation, there is no one in the world not blamed. 

Na cāhu na ca bhavissati, na cetarahi vijjati
There was not and there will not be, and at present there is not found
 
ekantaṁ nindito poso, ekantaṁ vā pasaṁsito. [228]
a person totally blameworthy, or one totally praiseworthy. 

Yañ-ce viññū pasaṁsanti, anuvicca suve suve, 
The one who, after being examined day by day, is praised by the wise,
 
acchiddavuttiṁ medhāviṁ, paññāsīlasamāhitaṁ, [229]
faultless in conduct, sagacious, attending to virtue and wisdom, 
 
nekkhaṁ jambonadasseva, ko taṁ ninditum-arahati? 
one who is like a golden coin, who is there worthy to blame him? 
 
Devā pi naṁ pasaṁsanti, Brahmunā pi pasaṁsito. [230]
That one is praised by the gods, and has been praised by the Brahmās too. 

Kāyappakopaṁ rakkheyya, kāyena saṁvuto siyā, 
One should guard against bodily anger, one should be restrained bodily, 
 
kāyaduccaritaṁ hitvā, kāyena sucaritaṁ care. [231]
abandoning wrong bodily conduct, one should have good bodily conduct. 

Vacīpakopaṁ rakkheyya, vācāya saṁvuto siyā, 
One should guard against verbal anger, one should be restrained verbally, 
 
vacīduccaritaṁ hitvā, vācāya sucaritaṁ care. [232]
abandoning wrong verbal conduct, one should have good verbal conduct. 

Manopakopaṁ rakkheyya, manasā saṁvuto siyā, 
One should guard against mental anger, one should be restrained mentally, 
 
manoduccaritaṁ hitvā, manasā sucaritaṁ care. [233]
abandoning wrong mental conduct, one should have good mental conduct. 

Kāyena saṁvutā dhīrā, atho vācāya saṁvutā, 
The wise are restrained bodily, then they are restrained verbally, 
 
manasā saṁvutā dhīrā, te ve suparisaṁvutā. [234]
the wise are restrained mentally, they are indeed very well-restrained.
