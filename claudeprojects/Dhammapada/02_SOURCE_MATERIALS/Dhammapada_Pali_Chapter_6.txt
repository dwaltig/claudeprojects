Paṇḍitavaggo
6. The Chapter about the Wise 
 
Nidhīnaṁ va pavattāraṁ yaṁ passe vajjadassinaṁ, 
One should regard someone who shows your faults just like one who points out hidden treasure, 
 
niggayhavādiṁ medhāviṁ tādisaṁ paṇḍitaṁ bhaje;
one should keep company with such a sagacious, learned person who reproves you; 
 
tādisaṁ bhajamānassa seyyo hoti na pāpiyo. [76]
keeping company with such is (surely) better for you, not worse. 

Ovadeyyānusāseyya, asabbhā ca nivāraye, 
One should advise and instruct, and forbid whatever is vile, 
 
sataṁ hi so piyo hoti, asataṁ hoti appiyo. [77]
for he is dear to the good,{86} (but) he is not dear to the bad. 

Na bhaje pāpake mitte, na bhaje purisādhame,
One should not keep company with wicked friends, one should not keep company with the ignoble,
 
bhajetha mitte kalyāṇe, bhajetha purisuttame. [78]
you should keep company with spiritual friends, you should keep company with superior people.{87} 

Dhammapīti sukhaṁ seti, vippasannena cetasā, 
The one who drinks Dhamma{88} lives well, with a clear mind, 
 
Ariyappavedite Dhamme sadā ramati paṇḍito. [79]
the wise one will always delight in the Dhamma that is made known by the Noble. 

Udakaṁ hi nayanti nettikā, 
Course-makers lead water,
 
usukārā namayanti tejanaṁ, 
fletchers straighten arrows, 
 
dāruṁ namayanti tacchakā, 
carpenters straighten wood,
 
attānaṁ damayanti paṇḍitā.{89} [80]
the wise master themselves. 

Selo yathā ekaghano vātena na samīrati,
Just as solid rock is not shaken by the wind,
 
evaṁ nindāpasaṁsāsu na samiñjanti paṇḍitā. [81]
so the wise are not moved by blame or praise. 

Yathā pi rahado gambhīro vippasanno anāvilo, 
Like a lake that is deep, clear and unruffled, 
 
evaṁ Dhammāni sutvāna vippasīdanti paṇḍitā. [82]
just so the wise are confident{90} after listening to Dhamma. 

Sabbattha ve sappurisā cajanti, 
True people surely everywhere renounce,
 
na kāmakāmā lapayanti santo; 
the good do not talk of desiring sense-pleasures;
 
sukhena phuṭṭhā atha vā dukhena,
when touched by pleasure or by suffering,
 
noccāvacaṁ paṇḍitā dassayanti. [83]
the wise show neither elation or depression. 

Na attahetu na parassa hetu, 
Not for one&rsquo;s own sake and not for another&rsquo;s sake,
 
na puttam-icche na dhanaṁ na raṭṭhaṁ &ndash;
not desiring a child, riches, or a kingdom &ndash;
 
na iccheyya adhammena samiddhim-attano;
he should not desire his success through corruption;{91} 
 
sa sīlavā paññavā dhammiko siyā. [84]
he should be both virtuous and wise and righteous. 

Appakā te manussesu ye janā pāragāmino, 
Amongst humans few people go beyond,
 
athāyaṁ itarā pajā tīram-evānudhāvati, [85]
the rest of the people run down the bank, 
 
ye ca kho sammad-akkhāte Dhamme dhammānuvattino, 
but those who live righteously, conforming with this well-taught Dhamma, 
 
te janā pāram-essanti, maccudheyyaṁ suduttaraṁ. [86]
those folk will go beyond the realm of death, which is very hard to cross.{92} 

Kaṇhaṁ dhammaṁ vippahāya, sukkaṁ bhāvetha paṇḍito, 
Having abandoned the dark state, the wise one should develop the bright,
 
okā anokaṁ āgamma; viveke yattha dūramaṁ, [87]
having gone forth to homelessness from home; in solitude, where it is hard to delight. 

Tatrābhiratim-iccheyya, hitvā kāme akiñcano, 
One should desire to delight in that place, having given up sense pleasures, and having no possessions,
 
pariyodapeyya attānaṁ cittaklesehi paṇḍito. [88]
the wise one should purify the self of defilements of mind. 

Yesaṁ sambodhi-aṅgesu sammā cittaṁ subhāvitaṁ, 
For those who have well developed with right mind the factors of complete awakening,
 
ādānapaṭinissagge anupādāya ye ratā,
having given up grasping, those who delight in being unattached,
 
khīṇāsavā jutimanto, te loke parinibbutā. [89]
pollutant-free, shining forth, are emancipated in the world.
