# Chapter 25: The Monk

Who is the real monk? Not the one who wears the robe. Not the one who shaves the head. Not the one who begs for food. The REAL monk is the one who restrains, who meditates, who cuts off passion and hatred, who shines like the moon from behind clouds. This chapter paints that portrait—23 verses on what it really means to walk this path.

## Verses 360 and 361: Universal Restraint

The Buddha said:

"Restraint of the eye is good; restraint of the ear is good; restraint of the nose is good; restraint of the tongue is good.

Restraint of the body is good; restraint of speech is good; restraint of mind is good; restraint everywhere is good. The monk restrained everywhere is liberated from all suffering."

And here's the Blues truth: Restraint of the EYE is good. Restraint of the EAR is good. Restraint of the NOSE is good. Restraint of the TONGUE is good.

Restraint of the BODY is good. Restraint of SPEECH is good. Restraint of the MIND is good. Restraint is EVERYWHERE good.

The monk restrained everywhere? Liberated from ALL suffering. Six doors. Seven gates. Close the ones that need closing. THAT'S the practice.

## Verse 362: The True Monk

The Buddha said:

"One who controls their hands, controls their feet, controls their speech, controls the mind supreme, with inner delight and composure, solitary, content—that one is called a monk."

And here's the Blues truth: Controls his HANDS. Controls his FEET. Controls his SPEECH. Controls the MIND supreme. Has inner delight. Has composure. Is solitary. Is content.

THAT one is called a monk. Not the robe. Not the bowl. Not the head-shaving. The CONTROL—that makes the monk.

## Verses 363, 364, 365, and 366: Sweet Speech and Right Relationship with Gains

The Buddha said:

"The monk who restrains the mouth, who speaks thoughtfully, who is modest, who explains the meaning and the Dhamma—sweet is their speech.

One who finds pleasure in the Dhamma, who delights in the Dhamma, who reflects on the Dhamma, who recollects the Dhamma—that monk does not fall away from the True Dhamma.

One should not despise one's own gains, nor live envious of others. The monk envious of others does not attain concentration.

Even if a monk gains little, they should not despise their gains. The gods themselves praise one of pure livelihood who is diligent."

And here's the Blues truth: That monk who restrains the mouth, who speaks WELL, who is modest, who explains the MEANING of Dhamma—that one's speech is SWEET. Not sugary. Not flattering. SWEET—like honey that heals.

The one who finds PLEASURE in Dhamma, who DELIGHTS in Dhamma, who REFLECTS on Dhamma, who REMEMBERS Dhamma—that monk does NOT fall away from the Good Dhamma.

Don't despise what you've got. Don't live envious of others. The monk envious of others? Does NOT attain concentration. Even if you gain LITTLE, don't despise your gains. Even the GODS praise the one of pure life who is diligent.

## Verses 367 and 368: No Fondness, Loving-Kindness

The Buddha said:

"One who has no possessive fondness at all for mind-and-body, who grieves not for what does not exist—that one is truly called a monk.

The monk who dwells in loving-kindness, with faith in the Buddha's teaching, should attain the state of peace—the bliss of stilling all conditions."

And here's the Blues truth: The one who has NO fondness for mind and body—not attached to name-and-form—who grieves not for what does not exist—THAT one is surely called a monk.

The monk who DWELLS in loving-kindness, with FAITH in Buddha's teaching, should attain the state of PEACE, the joy in stilling ALL conditions. Mettā—loving-kindness—that's the dwelling place.

## Verses 369 and 370: Bail Out the Boat, The Rule of Fives

The Buddha said:

"Bail out this boat, O monk! When bailed, it will go swiftly. Having cut off passion and hatred, from there you will reach Nibbāna.

Cut off five, abandon five, cultivate five more. The monk who surmounts five attachments is called 'one who has crossed the flood.'"

And here's the Blues truth: BAIL OUT this boat, monk! When it's bailed out, it'll go LIGHTLY. Cut off PASSION. Cut off HATRED. Then from here you'll go to NIBBĀNA. Your boat's taking on water. Bail them out. Plug the holes. Then you'll sail smooth.

CUT five—the five lower fetters. ABANDON five—the five higher fetters. CULTIVATE five more—the five spiritual faculties. The monk who surmounts five attachments is called a FLOOD-CROSSER.

## Verses 371 and 372: Meditate! Concentration and Wisdom

The Buddha said:

"Meditate, O monk! Be not heedless! Let not your mind swirl in strands of desire. Heedless, do not swallow the hot iron ball. Burning, do not cry 'This is suffering!'

There is no concentration for one without wisdom; there is no wisdom for one without concentration. One who has both concentration and wisdom—that one is indeed near Nibbāna."

And here's the Blues truth: MEDITATE, monk! Do NOT be heedless! Don't let your mind SWIRL around in strands of desire. Don't, heedless, SWALLOW a hot iron ball. By then it's too late. Practice NOW.

No CONCENTRATION for one without wisdom. No WISDOM for one without concentration. But the one who has BOTH—concentration AND wisdom—is in the PRESENCE of Nibbāna. They feed each other. They need each other. Get BOTH.

## Verses 373 and 374: Superhuman Delight, Rise and Fall

The Buddha said:

"For one who has entered an empty place, a monk with peaceful mind, there is superhuman delight when rightly seeing the Dhamma.

Whoever rightly attends to the rise and fall of the aggregates gains joy and happiness—that is the deathless for one who knows."

And here's the Blues truth: For the one who enters an EMPTY place, with a PEACEFUL mind—there is SUPERHUMAN delight from insight into true Dhamma. Not the pleasure of the senses. SUPERHUMAN—the delight of seeing true.

Whoever has right MINDFULNESS regarding the RISE and FALL of the components of mind and body—gains JOY and HAPPINESS. That is the DEATHLESS state for the one who knows.

## Verses 375, 376, 377, and 378: Beginning, Friendship, Casting Off

The Buddha said:

"This is the beginning here for the wise monk: sense-guarding, contentment, and restraint in the monastic rules.

Resort to spiritual friends, those of pure livelihood, those who are diligent. Be of friendly disposition, skillful in conduct. Then, rejoicing greatly, you will make an end to suffering.

Just as the jasmine casts off its withered flowers, so, O monks, should you cast off passion and hatred.

Calm in body and calm in speech, having calmness and composure, having thrown off worldly gain—that monk is called 'one at peace.'"

And here's the Blues truth: THIS is the very beginning for the wise monk: CONTENTMENT. GUARDING the senses. RESTRAINT in the regulations.

Resort to SPIRITUAL FRIENDS—ones of pure life, ones who are diligent. Be FRIENDLY in disposition. Be SKILFUL in conduct. Rejoicing because of THAT—one will make an END to suffering.

Just as the striped jasmine casts off its withered flowers—so, monks, cast off PASSION and HATRED. The flower doesn't cling to what's dead. Neither should you.

CALM in body. CALM in speech. Having calmness and composure. Having thrown off worldly gain—THAT monk is called one at PEACE.

## Verses 379, 380, 381, and 382: Self Is Refuge, The Young Monk Shines

The Buddha said:

"By oneself one should censure oneself; by oneself one should examine oneself. Self-guarded and mindful, the monk will dwell happily.

Self is the protector of self; self is the refuge of self. Therefore control yourself as a merchant controls a noble horse.

The monk having much happiness, with faith in the Buddha's teaching, could attain the state of peace—the bliss of stilling all conditions.

The young monk who devotes themselves to the Buddha's teaching illuminates this world—like the moon freed from a cloud."

And here's the Blues truth: By ONESELF one should censure self. By ONESELF one should be controlled. He who guards himself, mindful, will live HAPPILY, monk.

SELF is the protector of self. SELF is the refuge of self. Therefore restrain yourself—like a merchant restrains his noble horse. You're the one. No one else can do it for you.

The monk having much HAPPINESS, with FAITH in the Buddha's teaching, could attain the state of PEACE, happy in the stilling of ALL conditions.

That YOUNG monk who is devoted to the Buddha's teaching—SHINES FORTH in this world like the MOON freed from a cloud. Young in years, maybe. But devoted? DEVOTED. That one SHINES.

## End of Chapter 25

What we learned in these twenty-three verses paints the portrait of the true monk. Restraint of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, speech, and mind leads to freedom. The true monk controls hands, feet, speech, mind—with inner delight. Sweet speech comes from restraining the mouth and explaining Dhamma. Don't despise your gains, don't envy others. No fondness for mind-body, no grief for what doesn't exist. Dwell in loving-kindness, attain peace. Bail out the boat—cut passion and hatred. Cut 5, abandon 5, cultivate 5, surmount 5 equals flood-crosser. Meditate or swallow iron balls later. No jhāna without paññā, no paññā without jhāna. Superhuman delight comes in empty places with peaceful minds. See rise and fall of phenomena, touch the deathless. Beginning: contentment, sense-guarding, good friends. Cast off passion and hatred like withered flowers. Self is the protector and refuge of self. The devoted young monk shines like moon from clouds.

THIS is what a monk looks like. Not the outfit. The PRACTICE.
