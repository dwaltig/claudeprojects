# Chapter 7: The Arahants

This chapter's about the ones who MADE IT. The arahants—the perfected ones. No more craving, no more suffering, no more rebirth. They leave no track like birds in the sky. Stand unmoved like earth, like a city-post, like a clear lake. Even the gods are jealous. This is what the path leads to. This is why we practice.

## Verse 90: No More Fever

The Buddha said:

"For one who has reached the goal, who grieves not, released on all sides, who has abandoned all the knots—no consuming fever is found."

And here's the Blues truth: Reached the goal. No more grief on any side. All the knots untied.

No consuming fever. No burning in the chest. The inner torment of craving—that fever breaks forever when you reach the goal. This one is at rest. The four knots—covetousness, ill-will, attachment to rites, dogmatism—all cut.

## Verse 91: Geese Leaving the Lake

The Buddha said:

"The mindful ones striving diligently do not delight in dwelling places. Like geese who abandon a lake, they leave behind all fondness for homes."

And here's the Blues truth: Mindful ones keep striving. Don't cling to where they stay. Like geese who leave the lake behind, they fly on away.

Home after home, they leave it all behind. Nothing holds their mind. Wild geese migrate without attachment to their temporary waters. The arahat moves on, never clinging to any dwelling.

## Verses 92 and 93: No Tracks in the Sky

The Buddha said:

"Those who have no stores, who comprehend food aright, whose resort is the liberation that is empty and signless—like birds in the sky, their track is hard to find.

For the one whose pollutants are destroyed, who is not dependent on food, whose resort is the liberation that is empty and signless—like birds in the sky, his footprint is hard to find."

And here's the Blues truth: No stores to guard. Eating just what they need. Living in liberation—empty, signless, freed.

Like birds in the sky, their track is hard to find. No footprints left behind. Birds leave no marks in the air. The perfected leave no path to trace. Māra searches everywhere—can't find them anyplace.

Two of the three liberations: emptiness and signlessness. The arahat leaves no trace for rebirth to follow.

## Verse 94: Even the Gods Are Jealous

The Buddha said:

"One whose senses are stilled, like horses well-trained by a charioteer, who has abandoned conceit, who is without pollutants—even the gods envy such a one."

And here's the Blues truth: Senses stilled like horses trained just right. Charioteer holding tight.

Conceit abandoned, pollutants gone—even the gods look down and sigh. EVEN THE GODS are jealous. Gods have pleasure but they're still bound. This one is FREE. Gods will fall back down one day—they're still subject to rebirth. This one won't be.

## Verse 95: Earth, Post, Lake

The Buddha said:

"Untroubled like the earth, steadfast like a city-post, like a lake free from mud—such a one continues not in births and deaths."

And here's the Blues truth: Three images of absolute stability.

Untroubled like the earth—pour anything on it, it don't react. Steady, solid.

Steadfast like a city-post—driven deep, won't ever sway. Standing there to stay.

Clear like a lake with no mud—pure from bottom to top.

Earth. Post. Lake. For such a one, samsara ends. No more rounds to make.

## Verse 96: Peace in Mind, Speech, and Action

The Buddha said:

"His mind is calm, his speech is calm, his actions are calm—liberated by right knowledge, such a one is truly peaceful."

And here's the Blues truth: Calm in mind. Calm in speech. Calm in deed. Through and through, peace has filled every part. In action, word, and heart.

Not through ritual or luck, but through direct insight. Peace has perfused every aspect of being.

## Verse 97: The Supreme Person

The Buddha said:

"The one beyond mere faith, who knows the unmade, who has cut off rebirth-linking, who has destroyed the occasion, who has thrown out hope and desire—this is truly the supreme person."

And here's the Blues truth: Five marks of supremacy.

Beyond mere faith—they KNOW. They don't believe; they've seen. They know the unmade, the unconditioned ground—nibbāna itself. Cut off rebirth-linking—severed the connection to future lives. Destroyed the occasion—eliminated the conditions for further becoming. Thrown out hope and desire—nothing left to chase.

This one, THIS ONE, is the supreme of the race. The highest we can be. Utterly free.

---

## Verse 98: Wherever They Live Is Holy Ground

The Buddha said:

"Whether in village or wilderness, on low ground or high—wherever the arahants dwell, that ground is delightful."

And here's the Blues truth: Village or wilderness. Low ground or high. WHEREVER the arahants dwell, that ground is blessed thereby.

They don't need a special place. The place needs THEM. Wherever they sit down, that's where the light comes in. This inverts our usual assumption that places make us happy—here, the person blesses the place.

---

## Verse 99: Joy Where Others Can't Find It

The Buddha said:

"The delightful wildernesses where ordinary people find no delight—those without passion will take joy there, for they seek not sense pleasures."

And here's the Blues truth: Delightful wilderness—but regular folks get bored. Nothing to chase, nothing to buy, nothing that they're looking for.

But those without passion? They find the joy right there. Not seeking sense pleasure, they find joy EVERYWHERE. What others flee from, they call home. What others can't stand, they embrace.

Their joy doesn't depend on getting something. It just IS.

## End of Chapter 7

What we learned in these ten verses shows what the path leads to. No more consuming fever—the goal is reached. Like geese leaving the lake—no clinging to home. Like birds in the sky—no track to find. Even the gods are jealous. Unmoved like earth, post, and clear lake. Calm in mind, speech, and action. The supreme person—beyond faith, knowing the unmade. Wherever they dwell is holy ground. They find joy where others find emptiness.

Trackless in the sky. Unmoved on the ground. This is where the path leads—where freedom is found.
