# Chapter 3: The Mind

Your mind. It's the wildest horse you ever tried to ride. Faster than thought—well, it IS thought. Slipperier than water. Can't see it, can't touch it, but it runs your whole life.

These eleven verses are about one thing: train your mind, or it'll run you into the ground. Point it right, you got the best friend you could ever have. Point it wrong, you got your worst enemy living right inside your skull.

## Verses 33 and 34: The Untrained Mind

The Buddha said:

"An agitated, unsteady mind, difficult to guard, difficult to ward—the sagacious one makes straight, as a fletcher straightens an arrow.

Like a fish thrown upon dry land, pulled from its watery home, this mind thrashes about—therefore, throw off Māra's dominion."

And here's the Blues truth: Your mind's shaking, twitching, won't hold still. Can't guard it, can't hold it—but the wise one straightens that mind, slow and true, like a fletcher working on his arrow. Patient, skilled, seeing it through.

And when you try to train it? Your mind's like a fish thrown on dry land—flopping, gasping, wild with fear. That's what happens when you pull it away from its distractions. That's the panic when you try to get it still.

But that's exactly why you train it. When you feel that panic, that restless thrashing—use it. Let it show you how trapped you've been. Use the discomfort to break free from Māra's grip. Learn to be like the fletcher: patient, skilled, shaping what's wild. The agitation isn't failure. It's your wake-up call.

## Verses 35 and 36: Guard What You Can't See

The Buddha said:

"For the mind that is difficult to subdue, flighty, flitting wherever it will—restraint is good; a restrained mind brings happiness.

Hard to see, very subtle, flitting wherever it desires—the sage should guard the mind; a guarded mind brings happiness."

And here's the Blues truth: Hard to tame, flits wherever it wants. Who ever told you freedom from restraint was happiness? That's a lie. Restraint is good—restraint brings peace.

Hard to see, subtle as smoke in the dark. Can't grab it, can't touch it—but you can guard it. A guarded mind brings happiness. Same teaching, same result.

Restrain it. Guard it. Don't let it run wild. Chain it with kindness. Leash it with love.

## Verse 37: The Mind That Roams Far

The Buddha said:

"Those who will restrain the mind that roams far, wanders alone, bodiless, hidden in the cave—they gain release from Māra's bonds."

And here's the Blues truth: It roams far, roams alone, has no body, hides in a cave. Can't see it, can't touch it—but it runs your whole life.

Four qualities of your mind: it travels instantly to distant places and times; it wanders in radical privacy—nobody else is in there with you; it has no physical form you can point to; it hides in the cave of your heart or your head.

This invisible, elusive thing determines everything. But those who tame it break free from Māra's bonds. That's the only way to be free.

## Verses 38 and 39: Unsettled and Settled Minds

The Buddha said:

"For one whose mind is unsettled, who does not know the True Dhamma, whose confidence wavers—wisdom is never fulfilled.

For one whose mind is free from lust, whose heart is unperplexed, who has abandoned both merit and demerit—for the watchful one, there is no fear."

And here's the Blues truth: The contrast couldn't be starker.

The Unsettled Mind: You got an unsettled mind, you don't know the True Teaching, your confidence wavers like a candle in the wind. Result? Wisdom is never fulfilled. Not because you're bad—but because you can't sustain attention long enough to understand anything.

The Settled Mind: But you get free from lust, you clear up your confusion, you abandon both merit and demerit—what's left to fear? Nothing left to lose, nothing left to protect. When you've let go of everything, what is there left to deflect? For the wakeful one, there is no fear.

## Verse 40: The Jar and the Fortress

The Buddha said:

"Knowing this body is frail like a jar, establishing the mind like a fortress, fight Māra with wisdom's weapon—guard your success, remain unattached."

And here's the Blues truth: Two different things you're working with.

Your body: fragile like a clay pot. Drop it and it shatters. That's what you got. Can't change that fact.

Your mind: build it like a fortress. Stone walls and strong gates. Nothing gets past this. That's what you CAN change.

Fight Māra with wisdom—that's the only weapon that actually works. Guard what you've won. But here's the kicker: don't cling to the perks. Win the battle, then let go of the win. That's how you keep from becoming a spiritual materialist—proud of your progress, attached to your achievements. Let that go too.

## Verse 41: The Body's Fate

The Buddha said:

"Before long, alas, this body will lie upon the ground, rejected, without consciousness, like a useless piece of wood."

And here's the Blues truth: Soon—sooner than you think—this body will lie on the ground. Rejected, abandoned, no consciousness inside. Just a useless piece of wood. That's what happens when you die.

This ain't meant to depress you. This is meant to motivate you. What are you waiting for? Time is running out while you sit there. Train your mind NOW—before it lies on the floor.

The body you cherish will become garbage. So don't put all your eggs in that basket. Train what lasts.

## Verses 42 and 43: Your Worst Enemy, Your Best Friend

The Buddha said:

"Whatever an aggressor does to an aggressor, or an enemy to an enemy—a wrongly-directed mind can do far worse than that to him.

Not mother, not father, nor any other relative could do as much for him as a rightly-directed mind."

And here's the Blues truth: These final twin verses summarize the whole chapter.

The Worst Enemy: What your enemy does to you—lies about you, steals from you, hurts you—a wrongly-directed mind does worse. Your own mind, turned against you, pointed wrong, creates karma that follows you across lifetimes. No outer foe can match the damage of your own untrained mind.

The Best Friend: What your mama couldn't do for you, what your daddy couldn't give, what no relative could offer—a rightly-directed mind gives you more. Your own mind, turned toward liberation, pointed right, is better than any gift, better than any love anyone else can provide. Liberation? Only YOU can give yourself that, through mental training.

Point it right, you got the best friend you'll ever have. Point it wrong, you got your worst enemy living inside your skull.

## End of Chapter 3

What we learned in these eleven verses comes down to one thing: Your mind is either your best friend or your worst enemy. YOU decide which by how you train it.

Your mind's wild—train it like a fletcher trains an arrow. It panics when you start training—like a fish on dry land. Restraint is good, guarding is good—both bring happiness. It roams far, hides in a cave—but tame it and break free. Unsettled mind equals unfulfilled wisdom. Settled mind equals no fear, nothing left to lose. Body fragile like a jar—mind strong like a fortress. Fight Māra with wisdom, then let go of the victory. Soon this body will be useless wood—train the mind NOW. Wrongly-directed mind is your worst enemy. Rightly-directed mind is your best friend—better than mama or daddy ever could be.

The Buddha and the Blues agree: your mind is either your best friend or your worst enemy. You decide which by how you train it.
