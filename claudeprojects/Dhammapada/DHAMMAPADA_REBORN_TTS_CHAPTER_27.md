# Chapter 27: The True Brahmin

This is the FINAL chapter—24 verses that redefine what it means to be a "brahmin." In Buddha's time, brahmins claimed spiritual superiority by birth. The Buddha said NO. A true brahmin is one who has done the work—regardless of caste, family, or lineage. This isn't about caste. It's about PRACTICE.

## Verses 387 and 388: The Buddha's Radiance, Etymology of Names

The Buddha said:

"The sun shines by day, the moon glows by night, the warrior shines in armor, the brahmin shines in meditation—but the Buddha shines with radiance all day and night.

Warding off wickedness, one is called 'brahmin.' Living austerely, one is called 'ascetic.' Driving forth one's own stain—therefore one is called 'one gone forth.'"

And here's the Blues truth: The SUN is radiant by day. The MOON shines by night. The armored NOBLE is radiant. The meditating BRAHMIN is radiant. Yet every day AND night, the BUDDHA is radiant through his power.

WARDING OFF wickedness—that's what makes one a brahmin. Living austerely—that's what makes one an ascetic. Driving forth all stain from oneself—that's what makes one going forth. The Buddha's redefining terms here. It's not about birth. It's about PRACTICE.

## Verses 389, 390, and 391: Non-Violence, Three Restraints

The Buddha said:

"A brahmin should not strike a brahmin, nor should the brahmin retaliate. Woe to one who strikes a brahmin! Greater woe to one who retaliates!

It is no small good for a brahmin when the mind turns back from what is dear, whenever the harmful mind turns back—there is calming of suffering.

One for whom there is no wrongdoing through body, speech, or mind, restrained in these three—that one I call a brahmin."

And here's the Blues truth: Don't STRIKE a true brahmin. Don't let fly at him. Woe to one who strikes a brahmin. FURTHER woe to one who lets fly! Non-violence is the true brahmin's way.

It is no LITTLE good for the brahmin when the mind is held back from what's dear, when the mind turns back from violence—THEN suffering calms.

For whom there is NO wrong-doing—bodily, verbally, or mentally—restrained in THREE things—THAT one I call a brahmin. Three doors. Three restraints. Body. Speech. Mind.

## Verses 392, 393, and 394: Honor Teachers, Not Birth But Truth

The Buddha said:

"From whomever one learned the Dhamma taught by the Perfectly Awakened One—one should respectfully bow to them as a brahmin bows at the fire-sacrifice.

Not by matted hair, not by clan, not by birth is one a brahmin. In whom there is truth and Dhamma—that one is pure, that one is truly brahmin.

What use your matted hair, O fool? What use your deerskin garment? Within you is a jungle—you polish only the outside!"

And here's the Blues truth: One from whom you learned Dhamma—taught by the Perfect Buddha—BOW to that one with respect, like a brahmin bows at fire-sacrifice. Honor your teachers. They gave you the Teaching.

Not because of MATTED HAIR, not because of FAMILY, not because of BIRTH is one a true brahmin. In whom there is TRUTH and DHAMMA—that one is PURE. THAT one is surely a brahmin.

Why the matted hair, foolish one? Why the deer-skin? Within you is a JUNGLE. You only polish the OUTSIDE. It's not the costume. It's what's INSIDE.

## Verses 395, 396, and 397: The Forest Meditator, Non-Attachment, Cutting Fetters

The Buddha said:

"One wearing discarded cloth, lean, with veins visible, meditating alone in the forest—that one I call a brahmin.

I do not call one a brahmin merely because of birth from a womb. That one is just one who says 'bho' if attached. Having nothing, unattached—that one I call a brahmin.

Whoever has cut all fetters, who surely does not tremble, who has surmounted attachments, detached—that one I call a brahmin."

And here's the Blues truth: That one who wears discarded clothes, LEAN with protruding veins, who meditates ALONE in the forest—THAT one I call a brahmin. Not the well-fed. The ASCETIC. The solitary.

I do NOT call one a brahmin simply because of being born from a womb. Having NOTHING and UNATTACHED—THAT one I call a brahmin. Birth is accident. Non-attachment is CHOICE.

Whoever has CUT OFF all the fetters surely does NOT tremble. Surmounting attachments, detached—THAT one I call a brahmin. When the chains are cut, why would you shake?

## Verses 398, 399, and 400: Symbolic Bonds, Endurance, The Final Body

The Buddha said:

"Having cut the thong, the strap, the rope together with the bridle, having thrown off the bolt, awakened—that one I call a brahmin.

Whoever, being pure, endures abuse, imprisonment, and beatings, with patience as their strength, with an army of strength—that one I call a brahmin.

Without anger, dutiful, virtuous, without swelling, trained, in their final body—that one I call a brahmin."

And here's the Blues truth: Whoever has cut off the THONG, the STRAP, the ROPE, together with the BRIDLE—who has thrown off the obstacle and is AWAKENED—THAT one I call a brahmin. Thong is hatred. Strap is craving. Rope is wrong views. Bridle is ignorance. Cut them ALL.

Whoever, being PURE, forbears with punishment, bondage, and abuse—having the strength of ENDURANCE, having an army of strengths—THAT one I call a brahmin. Patience isn't weakness. It's an ARMY.

Whoever is controlled of mind, dutiful, virtuous, taint-free, well-trained and in the FINAL body—THAT one I call a brahmin. No more bodies after this.

## Verses 401, 402, and 403: Unsmeared, Knowing Suffering's End, Deep Wisdom

The Buddha said:

"Like water on a lotus leaf, like a mustard seed on a needle tip—one who does not cling to pleasures—that one I call a brahmin.

Whoever knows right here the destruction of their own suffering, having put down the burden, detached—that one I call a brahmin.

The deeply wise, sagacious, skilled in what is path and non-path, having reached the highest goal—that one I call a brahmin."

And here's the Blues truth: Like WATER on the lotus leaf, like a MUSTARD SEED on a needle—not sticking—he who is UNSMEARED by desires—THAT one I call a brahmin. The water rolls off. The seed can't balance. Desire DOESN'T STICK.

Whoever knows RIGHT HERE the destruction of suffering, putting down the BURDEN, detached—THAT one I call a brahmin. Not some other life. RIGHT HERE. Burden DOWN.

The DEEPLY wise sagacious one, skilled in what IS path and what ISN'T path, who has reached the ultimate good—THAT one I call a brahmin.

## Verses 404, 405, and 406: Doesn't Mix, Non-Violence, Friendly Among Hostile

The Buddha said:

"One who doesn't mix with householders or the homeless, wandering without abode, with few desires—that one I call a brahmin.

Having laid down the stick against beings both fearful and fearless, who neither hurts nor kills—that one I call a brahmin.

Friendly among the hostile, calm among those with raised sticks, unattached among the attached—that one I call a brahmin."

And here's the Blues truth: Whoever doesn't mix with either householders OR the houseless—wandering homeless, with FEW desires—THAT one I call a brahmin. Not playing social games. UNENTANGLED.

Whoever has laid down the STICK used against all beings—fearful AND fearless—who neither hurts nor kills—THAT one I call a brahmin. The stick is DOWN. No violence.

Being FRIENDLY with the hostile, CALM amongst those holding sticks, NOT attached amongst those attached—THAT one I call a brahmin. They're angry—you're not.

## Verses 407, 408, 409, and 410: Dropping Defilements, True Speech, Takes Nothing, No Longings

The Buddha said:

"Whoever has let fall passion and hatred, conceit and contempt, like a mustard seed from a needle tip—that one I call a brahmin.

Whoever speaks words of truth, informed and not harsh, through which no one is angered—that one I call a brahmin.

Whoever in this world takes not what is not given—whether long, short, small, large, pleasant or unpleasant—that one I call a brahmin.

One who has no longings in this world or in the next, without hope, detached—that one I call a brahmin."

And here's the Blues truth: Whoever has dropped off passion and hatred, conceit and anger—like a MUSTARD SEED from a needle—THAT one I call a brahmin. Try balancing a mustard seed on a needle. It WON'T stay.

Whoever speaks a word of TRUTH that is informed and NOT coarse—through which NO ONE would be angry—THAT one I call a brahmin. Truth doesn't have to hurt.

Whoever in this world does NOT take what is not given—long or short, small or large, attractive or unattractive—THAT one I call a brahmin. Nothing that isn't offered.

For one who has NO longings—in this world OR the next—being without longings, detached—THAT one I call a brahmin.

## End of Chapter 28

What we learned in these 24 verses comes down to redefining holiness. The Buddha shines all day and night. A brahmin is made by practice, not birth. Non-violence is the way. Honor your teachers. It's what's inside, not the costume. The forest meditator, lean and alone. Cut all fetters. Endure with patience. No anger, in the final body. Like water on lotus, like mustard on needle. Know suffering's end RIGHT HERE. Deep wisdom. Don't mix. Lay down the stick. Be friendly among the hostile. Drop the defilements. Speak truth gently. Take nothing not given. No longings—here or there.

THAT one I call a brahmin—the one who lives it.
