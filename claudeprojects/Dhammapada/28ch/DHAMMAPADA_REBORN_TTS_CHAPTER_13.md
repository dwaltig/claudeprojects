# Chapter 13: The World

The world. Beautiful like a king's chariot—and just as trapping. See it as a bubble. See it as a mirage. The fools get depressed when it fails them; the wise see through it and aren't bound. And here's the kicker: stream-entry—just the FIRST step on the path—is worth more than ruling the whole world.

## Verses 167, 168, and 169: Live by Dhamma

The Buddha said:

"One should not follow lowly things, one should not abide heedlessly, one should not follow wrong view, one should not foster worldliness.

One should strive, not be heedless, live by Dhamma with good conduct. Living by Dhamma, one lives at ease in this world and the next."

And here's the Blues truth: Don't follow lowly things. Don't live heedlessly. Don't follow wrong views. Don't foster worldly ways that keep you trapped.

Strive, don't slack. Live by Dhamma, live right. Those who live by Dhamma rest easy day and night. This world and the next, both at ease, both at peace. That's where suffering ceases.

## Verses 170 and 171: Bubble, Mirage, Gilded Chariot

The Buddha said:

"See it as a bubble, see it as a mirage—looking on the world in this way, the King of Death does not see one.

Come, look upon this world adorned like a king's gilded chariot—where fools become depressed. There is no bond for those who understand."

And here's the Blues truth: See it as a bubble. See it as a mirage. Look at the world that way, and Death's king can't find your passage.

Come, look at this world—gilded like a royal ride. Beautiful, shining, attractive. But fools get depressed inside when it inevitably fails.

No bond for those who understand. No bond for those who see. See through the gilded chariot—and you are FREE.

## Verses 172 and 173: Moon Breaking Through

The Buddha said:

"Whoever was heedless before but later becomes not heedless—that one shines brightly on this world like the moon released from a cloud.

One whose wicked deed done is covered over by doing good—that one shines brightly on this world like the moon released from a cloud."

And here's the Blues truth: Was heedless before, but now you've woken up—you shine on this world like the moon when clouds break up.

Did wicked deeds before, but now you cover them with good—you shine on this world like the moon released from its hood.

The cloud can't destroy the moon. It only hides it for a while. Your luminous nature remains—it's waiting to shine. Past heedlessness or past evil can be overcome.

## Verses 174 and 175: Few Escape

The Buddha said:

"This world is blind; few here have true insight. As few go to heaven as birds that escape from the net.

Geese go through the path of the sky; they go through the firmament by their power. The wise are led out of the world after defeating Māra and his host."

And here's the Blues truth: This world is blind. Few here really see. Few go up to heaven—like birds that break free from the net.

Geese fly the sun's path, high through the sky they roam. The wise are led out of the world after beating Māra and his throne. Few escape. Most stay bound in the net. But those who defeat the tempter reach where freedom's set.

## Verses 176 and 177: The Liar and the Miser

The Buddha said:

"For the person speaking falsely, who has transgressed in this one thing, who has abandoned the next world—there is no wickedness left undone.

The miserly go not to the world of the gods; fools surely do not praise giving. But the wise one rejoices in giving and through that is happy hereafter."

And here's the Blues truth: Speak falsely, lie and lie—once truth is gone, all wickedness follows. Abandon the next world for this one? The future turns hollow. Lying destroys your ethical foundation.

The miserly don't reach heaven. Fools don't praise giving. But the wise rejoice in generosity—THAT'S the art of living. Give freely, and happiness follows behind.

## Verse 178: Better Than World Sovereignty

The Buddha said:

"Having sole sovereignty over the earth, or going to heaven, or lordship over the whole world—better is the fruit of stream-entry."

And here's the Blues truth: Rule the whole earth. Or go to heaven above. Or be lord of all the worlds. BETTER is the first taste of freedom's love.

Stream-entry—just the first step on the way—worth more than ruling everything. Worth more than all the world's display. One step on the path, one glimpse of what's true—worth more than being king of everything. That first step changes you forever.

## End of Chapter 13

What we learned in these twelve verses shows how to see through the world. Don't follow lowly things or wrong views. Live by Dhamma—rest easy in both worlds. See the world as bubble, as mirage. The gilded chariot binds fools; the wise see through. Past heedlessness can be overcome—moon breaks through clouds. Past evil covered by good—you can shine again. This world is blind; few escape the net. The wise defeat Māra and fly free. Lying opens the door to all wickedness. Miserliness blocks heaven; generosity opens it. And most striking: STREAM-ENTRY IS BETTER THAN WORLD SOVEREIGNTY.

See it as a bubble. See it as a mirage. See through the gilded world—and you won't be in its cage.
