## Verses 197, 198, 199, and 200: Let Us Live Happily

The Buddha said:

"Let us live truly happily, without hatred among the hateful. Among humans who have hatred, let us live without hatred.

Let us live truly happily, without sickness among the sick. Among humans who are sick, let us live without sickness.

Let us live truly happily, without longing among those who long. Among humans who crave, let us live without longing.

We live truly happily, we who have no possessions. We will feed on joy like the gods of Streaming Light."

And here's the Blues truth: Let us live happily, without hate among the haters. Free while they're in chains.

Let us live happily, without sickness among the sick. While others feel affliction's prick, we can be free.

Let us live happily, without longing among the longers. Free from wanting's hunger.

We live happily, we who have nothing to own. We feed on joy, pure joy—like gods of light. The gods of Streaming Light feed on joy alone. That's the practitioner's model.

## Verses 201, 202, 203, and 204: Peace Is Supreme

The Buddha said:

"The victor generates hatred; the defeated one finds suffering. The one at peace lives happily, having abandoned victory and defeat.

There is no fire like passion, no offense like hatred, no suffering like the aggregates, no happiness beyond peace.

Hunger is the supreme sickness; conditioned existence is the supreme suffering. Knowing this as it really is, Nibbāna is the supreme good.

Health is the supreme gain; contentment is the supreme wealth; confidence is the supreme kinship; Nibbāna is the supreme good."

And here's the Blues truth: The victor breeds hatred. The loser finds pain. But the one AT PEACE lives happily, having dropped the whole victory game.

No fire like passion. No offense like hate. No suffering like the aggregates—no happiness beyond peace's gate.

Hunger is the supreme sickness. Conditioned life is supreme pain. Know this, really know it—NIBBĀNA is the supreme gain.

Health is supreme gain. Contentment is supreme wealth. Trust is supreme kinship. Nibbāna is supreme happiness.

## Verses 205, 206, 207, and 208: Taste of Dhamma, Company of the Wise

The Buddha said:

"Savoring the taste of solitude, and the taste of peace—one becomes fearless, faultless, drinking the joyful taste of Dhamma.

Meeting the noble is good; living with them is always pleasant. Through not meeting fools one will constantly be happy.

He who consorts with fools grieves for a long time. Dwelling with fools is suffering as with enemies always. The wise one dwells happily as with an assembly of kin.

Therefore, the firm, the wise, the learned, the virtuous, dutiful, noble—accompany such a true, intelligent person as the moon accompanies the stars."

And here's the Blues truth: Taste the solitude. Taste the peace. Become fearless, become clean. Drink the taste of Dhamma—sweetest thing you've ever seen.

Meet the noble—that's good. Live with them—that's pleasant always. Don't meet fools—that's happy.

Consort with fools? Grieve long. Dwell with fools? Suffer like with foes. But dwell with the wise? Happy—like family.

So follow the firm, the wise, the learned, the virtuous, dutiful, true—like the moon follows the stars through the sky. That's what the wise ones do.
