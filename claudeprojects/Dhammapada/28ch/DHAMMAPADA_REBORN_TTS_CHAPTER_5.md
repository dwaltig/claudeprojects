# Chapter 5: Fools

Fools. The Buddha's got a lot to say about 'em. Not stupid people—people who refuse to learn. People who make the same mistakes over and over. People who carry their worst enemy inside their own skull. This chapter holds up a mirror. Don't flinch if you see yourself.

## Verse 60: Long is the Night

The Buddha said:

"Long is the night for one awake; long is a league for one exhausted; long is the round of rebirths for fools who know not the True Dhamma."

And here's the Blues truth: Long is the night when you can't find sleep. Long is the road when your body's weak. But longer still—longest of all—is the wheel of birth and death for fools who won't learn the Dhamma.

The verse builds from minor discomfort to existential tragedy. All sufferings feel long to those who lack liberating understanding. The fool's suffering extends because they refuse the teaching that would end it.

## Verse 61: Walk Alone If You Must

The Buddha said:

"If while traveling one cannot find someone better or equal to oneself, one should firmly resolve to go alone: there is no friendship with fools."

And here's the Blues truth: If you can't find someone better, if you can't find someone the same, walk alone. There's no friendship in a fool's game.

Better lonely than bad company. Better lonely than dragging down your destiny. Bad companions drag you down faster than you can lift them up. This isn't arrogance—it's self-preservation. The solitary path beats the corrupting path every time.

## Verse 62: Nothing Is Yours

The Buddha said:

"'Sons are mine, riches are mine'—so the fool suffers vexation. When even self is not one's own, how then sons? How then riches?"

And here's the Blues truth: "Sons are mine! Riches are mine!" So the fool worries and frets, piling up phantom debts.

But here's the challenge: if your SELF ain't even yours—and friend, it ain't—how can sons be? How can gold be? Nothing's yours beyond the paint. Not even the one who's grabbing. If the "I" that supposedly owns things is impermanent and ownerless, what can truly belong to it? Stop grabbing what was never yours.

## Verse 63: The Wise Fool

The Buddha said:

"A fool who knows his foolishness is at least wise in that; but a fool proud of his wisdom—he is called a fool indeed."

And here's the Blues truth: A fool who knows he's foolish—at least he's got that right. A little spark of light.

But a fool proud of his wisdom, thinking he's the smartest one—HE'S the real fool. Can't learn nothing because he thinks he already knows. Know you don't know—that's where wisdom starts. Think you know it all already—that's the foolish heart.

## Verses 64 and 65: The Spoon and the Tongue

The Buddha said:

"Even if a fool attends on a wise man for his entire life, he does not learn Dhamma—as a spoon learns not the taste of curry.

If a perceptive person attends on a wise man even for a moment, he quickly learns Dhamma—as the tongue learns the taste of curry."

And here's the Blues truth: A fool can sit with a wise man his whole life long—won't learn a drop of Dhamma. Like a spoon in the curry, stirring it every day, but never tasting a single bite.

But a perceptive one sits with a wise man for just a moment's time and learns the Dhamma quick as lightning. Like the tongue that tastes curry on the first bite—knows immediately.

The famous spoon simile. Despite constant immersion in wisdom, the fool never absorbs it. It's not about duration of exposure—it's about capacity to learn. The difference between the spoon and the tongue.

## Verse 66: Your Own Enemy

The Buddha said:

"Stupid fools live with themselves as their own enemies, committing wicked deeds that produce bitter fruit."

And here's the Blues truth: Stupid fools walk around with their worst enemy inside. Carry what they can't outrun or hide.

Doing wicked deeds, planting bitter fruit. Your own hands sow the seeds—you're your own enemy at the root. Nobody hurts you like YOU do when you're working against yourself. The fool's tragedy is self-inflicted.

---

## Verses 67 and 68: Regret and Relief

The Buddha said:

"That deed is not well done which, having done, one regrets—for which one has tears on one's face as the result follows round.

That deed is well done which, having done, one does not regret—for which one is pleased and happy as the result follows round."

And here's the Blues truth: That deed ain't well done that leaves tears on your face. That deed IS well done that leaves peace in your heart.

Simple test: Regret marks bad deeds. No regret marks good ones. Your own heart tells you the truth. Karma's consequences pursue us—the tearful face versus the happy heart measure our actions' quality.

---

## Verse 69: Sweet Until It Ripens

The Buddha said:

"The fool thinks wickedness is sweet as long as it does not ripen; but when the wicked deed ripens, the fool undergoes suffering."

And here's the Blues truth: The fool thinks it's sweet while the deed is still young. Hasn't felt where it's heading from.

But when that deed ripens, when it finally comes true—the fool suffers. Bitter after the sweet. Evil feels pleasurable before results manifest. The initial sweetness is deceptive; the fool doesn't see the bitterness coming.

---

## Verse 70: Fasting Without Understanding

The Buddha said:

"Month by month the fool may eat with the tip of kusa grass; yet he is not worth a sixteenth part of those who have understood Dhamma."

And here's the Blues truth: Month after month the fool may fast, eat barely more than air—but he ain't worth a sixteenth part of those who really understand.

Starving body, empty mind—discipline without the knowing counts for nothing. All that pain with nowhere going. Asceticism without insight achieves nothing.

---

## Verse 71: Fire Under Ashes

The Buddha said:

"A wicked deed once done does not curdle at once, like milk. Smoldering, it follows the fool like fire covered with ashes."

And here's the Blues truth: A wicked deed don't show right away, like milk don't curdle fast. It burns slow and hidden, like fire under ash.

Smoldering, following the fool. Covered up but burning. Covered up but hot. That's your karma waiting—ready or not. Karma's delayed action seems dormant but is slowly ripening, quietly burning, waiting to consume.

---

## Verse 72: Learning That Destroys

The Buddha said:

"Whatever learning arises for a fool, it is only to his disadvantage—it destroys his good fortune and destroys his head."

And here's the Blues truth: A fool gains learning but it only does him harm. Turns knowledge to a weapon against himself. Destroys his good fortune, destroys his very head.

Learning in the wrong hands—better ignorant instead. Misused knowledge is worse than no knowledge at all.

---

## Verses 73 and 74: The Fool's Ambitions

The Buddha said:

"He may wish for undeserved respect, status among monastics, control in living quarters, worship from good families: 'Householders and renunciants alike should think this was done by me; let them all be under my sway in matters done and not done.' So thinks the fool—his desires and conceit only increase."

And here's the Blues truth: "Let them respect me, though I haven't earned it yet. Let them bow to me. Control in the quarters, worship from the crowd—'Everything was done by ME!'" So the fool thinks out loud.

Desires grow, conceit grows, while he plays the holy game. This is spiritual materialism exposed—ambition dressed in religious clothing. The opposite of genuine progress.

---

## Verse 75: Two Different Roads

The Buddha said:

"The means to gains is one thing; the path to Nibbāna, another. Understanding this, the Buddha's monastic disciple should not delight in honors but cultivate solitude."

And here's the Blues truth: The road to gains is one road. The road to Nibbāna's another. They ain't even related.

Don't delight in honors. Don't crave the clapping hands. Cultivate solitude—that's where freedom stands. Two roads pointing different ways. Choose the one to freedom, not the one that pays.

---

## End of Chapter 5

What we learned in these sixteen verses comes down to self-recognition. Long the night for the sleepless; longer the rebirths for fools. Better walk alone than with fools. Nothing is yours—not even you. Knowing you're a fool is the start of wisdom. Spoon never tastes curry; fool never learns Dhamma. You're your own worst enemy. Good deeds leave peace; bad deeds leave tears. Sweet now, bitter later—that's karma. Fasting without understanding equals nothing. Karma smolders like fire under ashes. Learning can destroy the fool. Ambition dressed in robes is still just ambition. Two roads: gains and liberation. Choose.

Don't be a fool. Learn from the teaching before day is done.
