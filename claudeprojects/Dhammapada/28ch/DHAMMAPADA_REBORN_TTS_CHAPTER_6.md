# Chapter 6: The Wise

If Chapter 5 held up a mirror showing the fool, this chapter shows who you COULD be. The wise one. Not born wise—MADE wise through practice. Stands like rock when the wind blows. Calm like a deep lake. Sees criticism as treasure. Crosses to the other shore while everybody else runs along the bank.

## Verses 76, 77, and 78: Choose Your People

The Buddha said:

"One should regard someone who reveals your faults as one who points out hidden treasure. Keep company with such a sagacious person who reproves you—for doing so is better, not worse.

One should advise and instruct, and forbid whatever is vile. Such a one is dear to the good, but not dear to the bad.

Do not keep company with wicked friends, do not keep company with the ignoble. Keep company with spiritual friends, keep company with superior people."

And here's the Blues truth: Someone shows you your faults? That's somebody showing you treasure. That's gold you couldn't find yourself. Most folks flee criticism; the wise seek it. Keep company with the one who reproves you—it's better for you, not worse.

And here's the test: Good folks love correction. Bad folks hate it cold. That tells you something about people, and what kind of truth they'll hold. The genuine teacher makes enemies among those who prefer flattery.

Don't walk with wicked friends. Don't keep company with the low ones—that's where your trouble begins. Walk with spiritual friends. Keep company with the noble—that's how your wisdom extends. The Buddha called spiritual friendship "the whole of the holy life."

## Verses 79 and 80: Drink Dhamma, Master Yourself

The Buddha said:

"One who drinks Dhamma lives well, with a clear mind; the wise one always delights in the Dhamma made known by the Noble Ones.

Course-makers lead water; fletchers straighten arrows; carpenters straighten wood; the wise master themselves."

And here's the Blues truth: Drink the Dhamma. Not just reading, not just hearing—drinking down into your soul. The wise one drinks the teachings, and that Dhamma makes them whole.

Course-makers lead the water. Fletchers straighten arrows. Carpenters straighten wood. Each material gets shaped by a skilled hand. But YOU shape your own self when you understand. Master yourself—that's the wise one's trade. You're the work you've made.

## Verses 81 and 82: Rock and Lake

The Buddha said:

"Just as solid rock is not shaken by the wind, so the wise are not moved by blame or praise.

Like a lake that is deep, clear, and unruffled, so the wise become calm after hearing Dhamma."

And here's the Blues truth: Solid rock—wind can't shake it none. Stands when the storm is done.

Blame comes, praise comes—the wise don't move at all. They don't rise, they don't fall. These are two of the eight worldly winds: gain and loss, fame and infamy, praise and blame, pleasure and pain. The wise stand unmoved by all of them.

Deep lake, clear lake—still water, no waves. After hearing Dhamma, after drinking truth, the wise settle deep and clear. Not stirred, not troubled, smooth.

Rock in the wind. Lake under sky. That's the wise one's mind—unmoved, clarified.

## Verse 83: Even in Pleasure, Even in Pain

The Buddha said:

"True people everywhere renounce; the good do not chatter about sense desires. When touched by pleasure or suffering, the wise show neither elation nor depression."

And here's the Blues truth: True people renounce wherever they may be. Good folks don't chatter about pleasure—they're working to be free.

Pleasure touches them? They don't fly up high. Suffering touches them? They don't fall down and cry. No elation, no depression. Even ground in every weather. Equanimity isn't suppression—it's deep stability. Pleasure and pain still come; the wise simply aren't thrown by them.

## Verse 84: Not for Self, Not for Other

The Buddha said:

"Not for one's own sake nor another's should one desire child, riches, or kingdom. One should not desire success through corruption; one should be virtuous, wise, and righteous."

And here's the Blues truth: Not for myself, not for another. Not for child, riches, or throne. Don't seek what's wrong to own.

Don't want success through cheating. Don't want the crooked gain. Be virtuous, be wise, be righteous—that's the wise one's campaign. This eliminates both selfishness AND misguided altruism as motivations.

## Verses 85 and 86: Few Cross to the Other Shore

The Buddha said:

"Among humans, few go beyond; the rest run along the near shore.

Those who live righteously according to the well-taught Dhamma—they will go beyond Death's realm, so hard to cross."

And here's the Blues truth: Few people cross. Most just run along the bank. Running on the bank—busy but never arriving.

But those who live the Dhamma, those who walk the well-taught way—THEY cross Death's hard river. THEY reach the other shore. Crossing while everyone else is just running in place.

## Verses 87, 88, and 89: Letting Go to Shine

The Buddha said:

"Having abandoned the dark state, the wise one should develop the bright; having gone from home to homelessness, in solitude, where delight is hard.

One should desire to delight in that solitude, having given up sense pleasures, possessing nothing. The wise one should purify the self of mental defilements.

Those who have well-developed minds in the factors of complete awakening, who delight in non-attachment, having given up grasping—pollutant-free, shining forth—they are emancipated in the world."

And here's the Blues truth: Abandon the dark, develop the light. Leave home for homelessness. Find solitude, where delight is hard—that's the wise one's test.

Learn to love that lonely place. Give up pleasures, own nothing. The wise one purifies the heart of all its clinging. The seven factors of awakening: mindfulness, investigation, effort, rapture, tranquility, concentration, equanimity.

Those whose minds are well-developed in these factors, who let go of grasping, delighting in non-attachment—they become pollutant-free. The taints of sensuality, becoming, and ignorance are destroyed. Shining forth like the sun! Emancipated in this world—the wise one's work is done.

## End of Chapter 6

What we learned in these fourteen verses shows the portrait of the wise. Someone showing your faults equals showing you treasure. The good love correction; the bad hate it. Walk with spiritual friends, not wicked ones. Drink Dhamma deep—don't just read it. Master yourself like craftsmen master their materials. Stand like rock, unmoved by praise or blame. Be deep like a lake, clear and still. Show neither elation nor depression. Don't seek success through corruption. Few cross the river; most run along the bank. Abandon the dark, develop the light. Purify the heart in solitary practice. The truly wise shine forth, pollutant-free, emancipated.

Rock in the wind. Lake under sky. Crossing to the shore. Shining forth on high.
