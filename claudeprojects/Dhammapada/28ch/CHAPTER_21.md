# Chapter 21: The Path

THE PATH. The Eightfold Path is best. There is no other path for insight and purity. Enter it or stay lost. This chapter has the Three Marks of Existence—impermanence, suffering, non-self—and the urgent warning: death comes like a flood on a sleeping village. No children, no father, no kin can save you. Walk the path NOW.

## Verses 273, 274, 275, and 276: This Is THE Path

The Buddha said:

"The Eightfold is the best of paths; four principles the best of truths; passionlessness the best of states; the Visionary the best of beings.

This is THE path—there is no other—for insight and purity. Enter upon this path; this confounds Māra.

Having entered this path, you will make an end to suffering. The path was declared by me for removing the dart through knowledge.

Your duty is ardor—the Tathāgatas only point the way. Meditators who enter this path are released from Māra's bonds."

And here's the Blues truth: Eightfold Path is best. Four Truths are best of all. Passionlessness is the best state. The Buddha's the best who stands tall.

THIS is the path—there is no other way. Enter this path for insight and purity. This confounds Māra's sway.

Enter this path, you'll end suffering. Remove the dart with knowledge—that's what the awakened do.

Your duty is ARDOR. The Buddhas just point the way. Meditators who walk this path break free from Māra's play. The Buddha points; YOU walk.

## Verses 277, 278, and 279: The Three Marks

The Buddha said:

"All conditions are impermanent. When one sees this with wisdom, one grows tired of suffering—this is the path to purity.

All conditions are suffering. When one sees this with wisdom, one grows tired of suffering—this is the path to purity.

All dhammas are without self. When one sees this with wisdom, one grows tired of suffering—this is the path to purity."

And here's the Blues truth: THE THREE MARKS.

All conditions are IMPERMANENT. See this with wisdom, and you'll be free. Grow tired of suffering—this is the path to purity.

All conditions are SUFFERING. See this with wisdom, and you'll be free. Grow tired of suffering—this is the path to purity.

All dhammas are WITHOUT SELF. See this with wisdom, and you'll be free. Grow tired of suffering—this is the path to purity.

Impermanent. Suffering. No-self. Three marks. See any one deeply, and you'll walk out of suffering's arcs.

## Verses 280, 281, 282, 283, 284, and 285: Cut the Forest, Not Just the Tree

The Buddha said:

"The lazy one—youthful, strong but indolent, mind lacking right intention—does not find wisdom's path.

Guarded in speech, well-restrained in mind, not doing wrong with body—purify these three paths of action; undertake the path shown by seers.

From effort arises wisdom; without effort, wisdom is destroyed. Understanding these two paths, establish yourself so wisdom grows.

Cut down the forest, not just a tree—from the forest arises danger. Having cut forest and thicket, be without forests, monastics.

As long as any atom of desire for women is not cut down, so long is the mind in bondage—like a calf bound to mother's milk.

Cut off self-affection like an autumn lotus plucked by hand. Develop the path to peace—Nibbāna taught by the Happy One."

And here's the Blues truth: The lazy one—young, strong, but sluggish, mind lacking right intent—does NOT find wisdom's path. All that energy misspent.

Guard your speech, restrain your mind, don't do wrong with the body. Three paths of action to purify—that's the path shown by seers.

From effort wisdom rises. Without effort wisdom dies. Know these two paths of growth and decline—set yourself where wisdom flies.

Cut the FOREST, not just a tree! The forest is where danger hides. Cut the forest AND the thicket—be without where craving resides.

As long as ANY desire holds even an atom's weight, the mind stays bound—like a calf to mother's milk estate.

Cut off self-affection! Like plucking an autumn lotus clean. Develop the path to peace—Nibbāna that the Buddha has seen.

## Verses 286, 287, 288, and 289: Death Comes Like a Flood

The Buddha said:

"'Here I'll stay for the rains; here for winter and summer'—so thinks the fool, not understanding the danger.

The person attached to children and cattle, mind besotted—is snatched by death like a sleeping village by flood.

Children are not refuge; nor father nor kin. For one overcome by the End-Maker, there is no refuge in relatives.

Understanding this truth, the wise one endowed with virtue should quickly purify the path leading to Nibbāna."

And here's the Blues truth: "I'll stay here for the rains, here for winter and summer too"—so thinks the fool, not seeing danger breaking through.

The one attached to children, cattle, mind besotted and caught—snatched by death like a sleeping village death has brought.

Children can't save you. Father can't save you. Kin can't save you. When the End-Maker comes for you, there is no refuge in relatives.

Knowing this—the wise one, endowed with virtue, should QUICKLY purify the path to Nibbāna.

## End of Chapter 21

What we learned in these seventeen verses declares THE path. The Eightfold Path is best of paths. THIS is the path—there is no other. Your duty is ARDOR; Buddhas only point. All conditions are IMPERMANENT. All conditions are SUFFERING. All dhammas are WITHOUT SELF. The lazy one doesn't find wisdom's path. From effort wisdom rises; without effort it dies. Cut the FOREST of defilements, not just a tree. Death comes like a flood on a sleeping village. Children, father, kin can't save you. QUICKLY purify the path to Nibbāna.

This is THE path. There is no other. Walk it NOW—or be swept like the flood takes another.
