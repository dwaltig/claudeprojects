# Chapter 11: Old Age

Old age. The body wearing down. Bones like dried gourds. But here's the treasure: the Buddha's ENLIGHTENMENT POEM is in this chapter. "O Housebuilder, now you are seen! You won't build this house again." That's the moment of liberation—craving exposed and defeated. This chapter holds both the hard truth of decay and the glorious truth of freedom.

## Verse 146: Why Are You Laughing?

The Buddha said:

"Why this laughter, why this joy, when the world is constantly burning? Enveloped in darkness, why do you not seek a light?"

And here's the Blues truth: Why the laughter? Why the joy when the world's on fire? Wrapped in darkness—why don't you seek something higher?

The world burns with greed and hate and confusion. The three fires. Enveloped in the dark—why not seek the light? The Dhamma is that light.

## Verses 147, 148, 149, and 150: This Body Is Falling Apart

The Buddha said:

"See this beautified puppet, a heap of sores raised up—sick, imagined in many ways, with nothing stable or firm.

This body is worn out, a nest of disease, perishing. The putrid body comes to destruction—life ends in death.

Like white gourds discarded in autumn are these grey bones. Seeing them, why is there delight?

This fortress is made of bones, plastered over with flesh and blood. But hidden within lie old age, death, conceit, and anger."

And here's the Blues truth: See this beautified puppet—a heap of sores dressed up fine. Sick, imagined, nothing stable—nothing in it's truly mine.

This body is worn out. A nest of disease. The putrid thing breaks down—life ends without reprieve.

Like white gourds thrown in autumn, these grey bones scattered round. Seeing them—why delight in what's unwound?

This fortress made of bones, plastered over with flesh and blood. But inside hides old age, hides death, hides conceit and anger's flood.

## Verses 151 and 152: What Lasts and What Doesn't

The Buddha said:

"Decorated royal chariots decay, and the body also decays. But the Dhamma of the good does not decay—the good pass it to the good.

The person of little learning grows old like an ox: his flesh increases, but his wisdom does not."

And here's the Blues truth: Royal chariots decay. Bodies decay. Everything fades at the end of day.

But the Dhamma of the good doesn't fade. The Dhamma stays true. The good pass it on to the good—that's the treasure that breaks through.

The person who doesn't learn grows old like an ox in the field. Flesh gets bigger, wisdom stays small. Nothing real is revealed.

## Verses 153 and 154: The Housebuilder (The Buddha's Enlightenment Song)

The Buddha said:

"Through the round of countless births and deaths I have wandered without finding the housebuilder I was seeking—born and suffering again and again.

O Housebuilder, now you are seen! You will not build the house again. All your rafters are broken, the ridgepole destroyed. My mind has reached the unconditioned; the end of craving has been achieved."

And here's the Blues truth: THIS IS THE BUDDHA'S ENLIGHTENMENT POEM. His first words after awakening.

Through countless births, countless deaths, I wandered and I wandered. Seeking the housebuilder, seeking the one who built this pain I've squandered. Born again, suffering again, round and round I roamed. Looking for the one who made this house, this prison I called home.

BUT NOW—

O HOUSEBUILDER, I SEE YOU NOW! You won't build this house again! All your rafters are BROKEN. The ridgepole's at its end!

My mind has reached the unconditioned. Craving's end has been achieved. You won't build this house again—I am FREED. I am FREED.

The Housebuilder is craving itself—the force that constructs the house of rebirth. When you see it clearly, when you break the rafters and destroy the ridgepole, no more house can be built. No more rebirth. Liberation complete.

## Verses 155 and 156: Don't Waste Your Youth

The Buddha said:

"Not having lived the holy life, not having gained wealth in youth, they waste away like herons in a small lake devoid of fish.

Not having lived the holy life, not having gained wealth in youth, they lie like spent arrows, wailing about the past."

And here's the Blues truth: Didn't live the holy life. Didn't get wealth when young. Now they waste away like herons where no fish have swum. Empty lake, nothing left to catch. Old and hungry—that's the wasted match.

Didn't live the holy life. Didn't get wealth when young. Now they lie like spent arrows, crying about what's done. Shot and fallen. Too late—youth didn't last.

Two regrets: no spiritual accomplishment AND no worldly accomplishment. Either way, wasted youth leads to helpless old age.

## End of Chapter 11

What we learned in these eleven verses confronts the reality of aging and offers liberation within it. Why laugh when the world burns? Seek the light! The body is a beautified puppet, a heap of sores, a fortress of bones hiding death and anger within. Royal chariots decay, bodies decay—but Dhamma doesn't. Don't grow old like an ox with more flesh and no more wisdom.

And the great treasure: The HOUSEBUILDER HAS BEEN SEEN! All the rafters are broken. No more rebirth. The end of craving has been achieved.

Don't waste youth—or become a heron in a fishless lake, a spent arrow wailing about the past.

The Housebuilder is seen. The ridgepole is down. No more building this house—freedom has been found.
