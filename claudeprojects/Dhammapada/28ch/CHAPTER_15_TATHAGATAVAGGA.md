# Chapter 15: The Tathāgata's Teaching

The Tathāgata—the Thus-Gone One, the Thus-Come One. This chapter focuses on WHAT the Buddha taught: the Three Refuges, the Four Noble Truths, and the blessing of the Buddha's arising. Not mountains or forests—Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha. THAT'S where freedom lives.

## Verses 188 through 192: The Three Refuges

The Buddha said:

"Many people shaken by fear go for refuge to mountains and forests, to tree-shrines in pleasure parks.

That is not a secure refuge; that is not the supreme refuge; coming to that refuge does not liberate from all suffering.

But whoever has gone for refuge to the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha, and sees with right wisdom the Four Noble Truths: Suffering, the arising of suffering, the overcoming of suffering, the Noble Eightfold Path leading to the stilling of suffering—THAT is a secure refuge; THAT is the supreme refuge. Coming to that refuge liberates from all suffering."

And here's the Blues truth: Shaken by fear, people run to mountains, forests, tree shrines. Looking for safety.

BUT—that's not a safe refuge. That won't end the suffering stream.

Whoever takes refuge in BUDDHA, DHAMMA, SANGHA, and sees the Four Noble Truths with right wisdom—Suffering, its arising, its overcoming, the Eightfold Path that stills it—THAT is a safe refuge. THAT liberates from every suffering stream.

Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha. THAT'S where freedom lives.

## Verses 193 through 196: The Buddha's Arising Is Good

The Buddha said:

"A person of noble breed is rare, not born everywhere. Wherever that wise one is born, that family gains happiness.

Good is the arising of Buddhas; good is the teaching of True Dhamma; good is the harmony of the Sangha; good is devotion to harmony.

Those who worship the worthy—whether Buddhas or disciples, who have overcome impediments, crossed over grief and lamentation—for those who worship such fearless ones, the emancipated—no one can measure their merit."

And here's the Blues truth: A noble person is rare, not born everywhere. Wherever they're born, that family gets happiness to share.

Good is the arising of Buddhas. Good is the teaching of truth. Good is the harmony of Sangha. Those who worship the awakened—their merit is beyond measure.

## End of Chapter 15

What we learned in these nine verses gives us the WHAT of Buddhism. Mountains and forests aren't safe refuge. BUDDHA, DHAMMA, SANGHA—that's the refuge. See the Four Noble Truths with wisdom. Good is the Buddha's arising, Dhamma's teaching, Sangha's harmony.

Take refuge. See the Four Noble Truths. Honor the awakened ones.
