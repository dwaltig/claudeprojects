# Chapter 25: Craving

This is THE chapter on craving. Taṇhā—that thirst, that hunger, that relentless wanting. The Buddha said craving is the cause of suffering. Cut the root, and the tree can't grow back. But leave even a scrap of root in the ground, and it'll sprout again. Twenty-six verses on the most important thing to understand: what binds you, and how to get free.

## Verses 334 and 335: Craving Grows Like a Creeper

The Buddha said:

"For a human who lives heedlessly, craving increases like a clinging creeper. They rush from one existence to another like a monkey seeking fruit in the forest.

One overcome by this wretched craving, this attachment to the world—for them griefs increase like grass after heavy rain."

And here's the Blues truth: For a human who lives HEEDLESSLY, craving grows like a clinging vine—that māluvā creeper that wraps around and chokes trees.

He rushes from HERE to THERE, like a monkey swinging through the forest, looking for fruit, never satisfied.

And when this LOW craving, this attachment to the world, overcomes you? Your GRIEFS increase—like grass after heavy rain, growing wild and thick.

## Verses 336 and 337: Overcome Craving, Dig Up the Root

The Buddha said:

"Whoever overcomes this wretched craving in the world, which is difficult to transcend—griefs fall from them like a water drop from a lotus.

This I say to you: 'Good fortune to all gathered here!' Dig up the root of craving, like one seeking the fragrant root digs up grass. Do not let Māra break you again and again, like a stream breaks the reed."

And here's the Blues truth: WHOEVER overcomes this low craving—difficult as it is to get past—griefs FALL from them like a drop of water off a lotus leaf. Doesn't stick. Doesn't soak in. Just rolls right off.

This I say to you—all of you gathered here: GOOD LUCK. Now DIG UP the root of craving. Like a man seeking the fragrant usīra root digs up the grass to get to it—DIG. Don't let Māra push you down again and again, like a stream pushes down a reed.

## Verses 338, 339, and 340: Root and Stream

The Buddha said:

"Just as a tree cut down grows again when its root remains firm and untroubled, so when the tendency to craving is not rooted out, this suffering arises again and again.

One in whom the thirty-six streams flow strong, streams flowing toward the pleasant—such a one of wrong view is carried away by passionate intentions.

Streams flow everywhere; the creeper springs up and stands. Seeing that creeper arisen, cut its root with wisdom."

And here's the Blues truth: You can cut the tree down, but if the ROOT stays firm, untroubled, it grows AGAIN. When the TENDENCY to craving isn't rooted out, suffering appears again and again.

In you flow THIRTY-SIX streams—pleasant and strong. The one with wrong view gets CARRIED AWAY by passionate intentions.

Streams are flowing EVERYWHERE. Creepers stay where they grow. When you SEE this creeper arise, cut its ROOT with wisdom. Don't just admire the vine. CUT.

## Verses 341, 342, and 343: Crawling Like a Hare in a Trap

The Buddha said:

"There are flowing streams of affection and mental pleasures for a person. Dependent on pleasures, seeking happiness, those people undergo birth and aging.

People surrounded by craving crawl around like a hare caught in a trap. Attached and clinging to fetters, they return to suffering again and again, for long.

People surrounded by craving crawl around like a hare caught in a trap. Therefore, the monk longing for dispassion should remove craving."

And here's the Blues truth: There are flowing streams of affection and mental happiness—we love those streams. Pleasure-dependent, we seek happiness and undergo birth and old age. Again. And again.

People surrounded by craving CRAWL AROUND like a hare caught in a trap—attached to fetters, clinging tight, coming back to suffering for a long, long time.

So REMOVE that craving. The monk who longs for dispassion should cut it out. Stop crawling. Stand up.

## Verses 344, 345, 346, and 347: Free Yet Running Back to Bondage

The Buddha said:

"One freed from the woods, intent on the forest—though freed from the forest, runs back to the forest. Come, look at this person: though freed, running back to bondage.

That bondage is not strong, say the wise, which is made of iron, wood, or reeds. But impassioned attraction to jewels and earrings, longing for children and wives—this bondage is strong, say the wise, dragging down, yielding, hard to escape. Having cut even this, they wander forth, seeking nothing, abandoning sensual happiness.

Those impassioned by passion follow the stream like a spider its self-made web. Having cut even this, the wise proceed, seeking nothing, abandoning all suffering."

And here's the Blues truth: LOOK at that person—free from desire, released from attachment—yet RUNNING BACK to the forest. Though FREE, he runs back to bondage. Hands untied, yet grabs the chains again.

The wise say iron bonds aren't strong. Wooden bonds aren't strong. Rope bonds aren't strong. But IMPASSIONED attachment to jewels and earrings, to children and wives—THAT bondage is strong. It DRAGS you down. It's subtle but HARD to escape.

Those impassioned by passion follow the stream—like a SPIDER caught in its own web. You spin the silk. You weave the trap. Then you GET CAUGHT in what you made yourself. But the WISE cut through, seeking nothing, abandoning ALL suffering.

## Verse 348: Be Free of Past, Future, Present

The Buddha said:

"Be free of the past, be free of the future, be free of the present. Having crossed over existence, with mind liberated in every way, you will not return to birth and aging."

And here's the Blues truth: Be FREE of the past. Be FREE of the future. Be FREE of the present.

Cross over ALL existence. Mind liberated in EVERY way. Then you won't return to birth and old age.

Three times. Past—let go. Future—let go. Present—let go. That's the whole thing.

## Verses 349 and 350: Thoughts, Passion, and Their Antidote

The Buddha said:

"For a person crushed by thoughts, of intense passion, contemplating the attractive—craving increases more and more. This surely makes the bond firm.

Whoever delights in thought-calmment, always mindfully cultivating the unattractive—will surely abolish this craving; they will cut Māra's bond."

And here's the Blues truth: For a person CRUSHED by thoughts, pierced by passion, contemplating the attractive—craving increases MORE. The bond gets FIRMER. That's the spiral down.

But whoever DELIGHTS in calming thoughts, who MINDFULLY cultivates what is UNattractive—THAT one abolishes craving. THAT one cuts Māra's bond. Same mind. Different cultivation. Different results.

## Verses 351, 352, and 353: The Final Body and the Buddha's Declaration

The Buddha said:

"Having gone to the end, without trembling, without craving, without defilement, having cut the thorns of existence—this is their final body.

Without craving, without grasping, skilled in expressions and their order, knowing how syllables are arranged, which come before and which after—this one in their final body is called 'one of great wisdom.'

'All-Conquering, All-Wise am I, undefiled regarding all things, having given up everything, liberated through craving's destruction. Having known directly myself—whom should I point to as Teacher?'"

And here's the Blues truth: Having gone to THE END, without trembling, without craving, without impurity, cutting off existence's darts—this is the FINAL body. No more after this.

The one in the final body is called a person of GREAT WISDOM.

"ALL-CONQUERING, ALL-WISE am I. Undefiled regarding all things. Having given up EVERYTHING, liberated through craving's destruction. When I have THIS deep knowledge myself—who should I point to as teacher?"

This is the Buddha speaking right after his awakening. He found it HIMSELF.

## Verse 354: The Gift That Surpasses All

The Buddha said:

"The gift of Dhamma surpasses all gifts; the taste of Dhamma surpasses all tastes; the love of Dhamma surpasses all loves; the destruction of craving overcomes all suffering."

And here's the Blues truth: The gift of DHAMMA surpasses all other gifts. The TASTE of Dhamma surpasses all other tastes. The LOVE of Dhamma surpasses all other loves. The DESTRUCTION of craving overcomes all suffering. Four supremes. Remember them.

## Verses 355, 356, 357, 358, and 359: The Four Weeds

The Buddha said:

"Riches destroy the foolish one who does not seek the way beyond. Through craving for riches, the fool destroys others and themselves.

Fields are ruined by weeds; these people are ruined by passion. Therefore, great is the fruit of giving to those free from passion.

Fields are ruined by weeds; these people are ruined by hatred. Therefore, great is the fruit of giving to those free from hatred.

Fields are ruined by weeds; these people are ruined by delusion. Therefore, great is the fruit of giving to those free from delusion.

Fields are ruined by weeds; these people are ruined by desire. Therefore, great is the fruit of giving to those free from desire."

And here's the Blues truth: Riches DESTROY the stupid one who doesn't seek the way beyond. Through craving for riches, the stupid one destroys OTHERS and HIMSELF. Wealth ain't the problem. CRAVING for wealth is the problem.

Fields are ruined by WEEDS. These people are ruined by PASSION. Give to those WITHOUT passion—great fruit. Ruined by HATRED. Give to those WITHOUT hatred—great fruit. Ruined by DELUSION. Give to those WITHOUT delusion—great fruit. Ruined by DESIRE. Give to those WITHOUT desire—great fruit.

Four weeds: Passion. Hatred. Delusion. Desire. Find those who've cleared the weeds. Support THEM.

## End of Chapter 25

What we learned in these twenty-six verses confronts us with craving's power and cure. Craving grows like a strangling creeper for the heedless. Like a monkey, the craving person rushes from thing to thing. Overcome craving, and grief rolls off like water off a lotus. DIG UP the root—don't just cut branches. Thirty-six streams of craving flow through you. People with craving crawl like hares in a trap. Some, though freed, run BACK to bondage. The real bonds are attachment to jewels, children, spouses. We spin our own web like the spider. Be free of past, future, AND present. Cultivate the unattractive to abolish craving. The Buddha himself conquered through craving's destruction. The gift of Dhamma surpasses all gifts. Craving for riches destroys self and others. Four weeds ruin people: passion, hatred, delusion, desire.

Craving is the ROOT. Everything else is branches. Get the root, and the tree dies forever.
