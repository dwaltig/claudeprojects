# Chapter 14: The Buddha

The Buddha. The awakened one. Victory that can't be undone, range that's endless, path that can't be traced. This chapter focuses on WHO the Buddha is—the pathless one, the one beyond tracking, the one whose arising is rare. Even the gods are jealous.

## Verses 179 and 180: The Pathless One

The Buddha said:

"He whose victory cannot be undone, whose victory no one in the world approaches, the Buddha, whose range is endless, the pathless one—by what path can you lead him?

He who has no ensnaring craving to lead him anywhere—the Buddha, whose range is endless, the pathless one—by what path can you lead him?"

And here's the Blues truth: His victory can't be undone. Nobody in the world comes close. The Buddha, endless in his range—the pathless one, beyond reproach.

By what path can you lead him? No craving leads him anywhere. Trackless, like birds in the sky. No way to follow him back—the liberated one cannot be led by desire.

## Verses 181 and 182: Four Rare Things

The Buddha said:

"Those wise ones intent on meditation, who delight in the peace of renunciation—even the gods are envious of them, the Fully Awakened Ones, the mindful.

Rare is birth as a human; rare is the life of mortals; rare is hearing the True Dhamma; rare is the arising of Buddhas."

And here's the Blues truth: Even the gods are jealous of those who meditate and know. Even the gods look down with envy on the fully awakened ones.

FOUR RARE THINGS: Rare to be born human. Rare this mortal life. Rare to hear the True Dhamma. Rare when a Buddha arrives.

Don't waste what you've got. This opportunity is precious—most beings don't get this shot. We've already won the lottery; don't waste the ticket.

## Verse 183: The Teaching of ALL Buddhas

The Buddha said:

"The non-doing of any wickedness, the undertaking of what is good, the purification of one's own mind—this is the teaching of the Buddhas."

And here's the Blues truth: DON'T DO EVIL. DO WHAT'S GOOD. PURIFY YOUR MIND.

That's it. That's the teaching. That's what every Buddha said. Simple to say, lifetime to accomplish. Everything else is commentary.

## Verses 184 and 185: Non-Harm and Practice

The Buddha said:

"Enduring patience is the supreme austerity. Nibbāna is supreme, say the Buddhas. One gone forth does not hurt another; an ascetic does not harass another.

Not finding fault, not hurting, restraint by the discipline, knowing the right measure of food, living in a remote dwelling, devotion to meditation—this is the teaching of the Buddhas."

And here's the Blues truth: Patience is the supreme austerity—not self-torture but forbearance. Nibbāna is supreme, say the Buddhas. Those gone forth don't hurt another.

The six guidelines: Not finding fault. Not hurting. Restrained by discipline. Knowing the right measure of food. Living remote. Devoted to meditation. THAT'S the teaching.

## Verses 186 and 187: No Satisfaction in Pleasure

The Buddha said:

"Not through a rain of coins is satisfaction found in sense pleasures. The wise one knows: 'Sense pleasures have little joy and much suffering.' Not even in heavenly pleasures does that one find delight. The disciple of the Fully Awakened One delights in craving's destruction."

And here's the Blues truth: Rain down coins—satisfaction won't be found. Sense pleasures have little joy and much suffering around. Even heavenly pleasures don't satisfy the wise.

The Buddha's disciple delights in craving's final demise. Not in getting more—in ENDING the wanting. That's where joy is, that's where peace is—in craving's end, not craving's haunting.

## End of Chapter 14

What we learned in these nine verses gives us the WHO of Buddhism. The Buddha's victory can't be undone. He's pathless—you can't lead him by desire. Even gods envy the awakened. Four rare things: human birth, life, Dhamma, Buddha. THE TEACHING: Don't do evil, do good, purify your mind. Patience is supreme austerity. No rain of coins satisfies craving.

Don't do evil. Do what's good. Purify your mind. That's the word.
