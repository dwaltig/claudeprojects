# Chapter 27: The Unconditioned

This is the chapter they didn't give its own name. The chapter about NIBBANA itself—the goal of the whole path. These 17 verses describe what it means to reach the Unconditioned, the Deathless, the shore beyond all shores. This isn't about being a good person. This is about being FREE.

## Verses 383 and 384: Cut the Stream, Know the Unconditioned

The Buddha said:

"Strive and cut the stream, O seeker! Drive away sense-desires. Knowing the destruction of conditions, be one who knows the unconditioned.

When one has crossed over through two things, then all fetters are laid to rest for one who knows."

And here's the Blues truth: STRIVE. Cut off the stream. Remove desire, seeker. Know the destruction of the conditioned—be one who knows the UNCONDITIONED.

When through TWO things you have crossed over—concentration and insight, calm and seeing—all fetters are laid to rest for one who knows. The stream is craving. Cut it off. The two things are stillness and seeing. Master them both.

## Verses 385 and 386: Beyond Both Shores, The Dustless Meditator

The Buddha said:

"One for whom neither the near shore, the far shore, nor both shores exist—free of anxiety, detached—that one has reached the goal.

The meditator, seated, dustless, duty done, without pollutants, having reached the highest goal—that one is liberated."

And here's the Blues truth: For whom the near shore doesn't exist, the far shore doesn't exist, NEITHER shore exists—free of anxiety, detached—THAT one has crossed over. What's the near shore? This life of clinging. What's the far shore? The next life. Transcend BOTH.

The meditator sitting down, DUSTLESS, who has done the duty, without pollutants, who has reached the ultimate good—THAT one is liberated. Not just sitting. DUSTLESS sitting. Duty DONE.

## Verses 411 and 412: Immersion in the Deathless, Beyond Merit and Demerit

The Buddha said:

"One who has no desires, who through knowledge is without doubt, who has reached immersion in the deathless—that one is liberated.

Whoever here has overcome attachment to both merit and demerit, griefless, dustless, pure—that one is liberated."

And here's the Blues truth: For one who has NO desires, who through knowledge is without doubt, who has reached IMMERSION in the deathless—THAT one is liberated. IMMERSION. Plunged into the undying.

Whoever here has overcome clinging to BOTH merit AND demerit—griefless, dustless, pure—THAT one is liberated. Even good karma can be a chain if you CLING to it. Let go of the good too.

## Verses 413 and 414: Pure Like the Moon, Crossed Over

The Buddha said:

"Just like the moon—stainless, pure, clear and undisturbed—having destroyed delight in existence—that one is liberated.

One who has crossed this difficult path, this mire, this saṃsāra, this delusion, who has crossed over to the far shore, a meditator, without lust, without doubt, without grasping, extinguished—that one is liberated."

And here's the Blues truth: Whoever, just like the MOON, is stainless, pure, clear and undisturbed—has destroyed JOY IN EXISTENCE—THAT one is liberated. The moon doesn't strive to shine. It just shines.

He who has crossed the difficult and dangerous path through births and deaths and delusion—the meditator who has crossed to the further shore, free of lust, free of doubt, unattached and COOLED DOWN—THAT one is liberated. Cooled down. Nibbana means "blown out"—the fire of craving extinguished.

## Verses 415 and 416: Giving Up Desires and Craving

The Buddha said:

"Whoever, giving up sensual desires, would wander here homeless, having destroyed sense-desire and existence—that one is liberated.

Whoever, giving up craving, would wander here homeless, having destroyed craving and existence—that one is liberated."

And here's the Blues truth: Whoever, giving up SENSUAL DESIRES, would wander homeless here—destroying desires and existence—THAT one is liberated.

Whoever, giving up CRAVING, would wander homeless here—destroying craving and existence—THAT one is liberated. Two verses, same message: Let go. Let go. Let go. Desire for existence itself must go.

## Verses 417 and 418: Beyond All Yokes, The Hero

The Buddha said:

"Abandoning the human yoke, overcoming the divine yoke, detached from all yokes—that one is liberated.

Abandoning delight and aversion, cooled and free from substrata, a hero who vanquished the whole world—that one is liberated."

And here's the Blues truth: Abandoning the HUMAN yoke, overcoming the DIVINE yoke, unattached to ALL yokes—THAT one is liberated. What's the human yoke? The bindings of this world. What's the divine yoke? Attachment to heavenly pleasures. Transcend BOTH.

Abandoning DELIGHT and AVERSION, cooled off, free from cleaving, a HERO who vanquished the whole world—THAT one is liberated. Beyond human bindings. Beyond heavenly bindings. Completely FREE.

## Verses 419, 420, and 421: The Liberated One

The Buddha said:

"Whoever knows beings' death and their rebirth in every way, unattached, well-gone, awakened—that one is liberated.

One whose destiny is unknown to gods, gandhabbas, and humans—pollutant-free, an arahant—that one is liberated.

One for whom there is nothing in past, future, or present, having nothing, unattached—that one is liberated."

And here's the Blues truth: Whoever knows in EVERY way beings' passing and their rebirth—unattached, fortunate, AWAKE—THAT one is liberated.

For one whose DESTINY is unknown to gods, gandhabbas, and men—being pollutant-free, an ARAHAT—THAT one is liberated. Where's that one going? No one knows. Beyond all tracking.

For whom there is NOTHING in the past, the future, or the present—having nothing, unattached—THAT one is liberated. Three times: nothing. Past, present, future: nothing. THAT'S freedom.

## Verses 422 and 423: The Sage Accomplished

The Buddha said:

"A bull, excellent, heroic, a great seer, victorious, without lust, bathed, awakened—that one is liberated.

Whoever knows their former lives, who sees heaven and the states of woe, who has reached the destruction of birth, the sage, accomplished in higher knowledge, accomplished in all accomplishments—that one is liberated."

And here's the Blues truth: A NOBLE leader, HEROIC, a great seer, VICTORIOUS—free of lust, CLEANSED and AWAKENED—THAT one is liberated.

Whoever knows their FORMER lives, and sees heaven and the downfall, and has attained BIRTH'S DESTRUCTION—the sage, accomplished in deep knowledge, who is accomplished in ALL accomplishments—THAT one is liberated. This is the Arahant. This is liberation. This is Nibbana.

## End of Chapter 27

What we learned in these 17 verses is the culmination of the path. Cut the stream. Cross both shores. Know the Unconditioned. Immerse yourself in the Deathless. Go beyond even merit. Shine like the moon. Cross saṃsāra and cool down. Give up the yokes—human and divine. Become the hero who vanquished the world. Nothing in past, present, or future. Birth destroyed.

This is Nibbana. This is what the whole Dhammapada points toward.
