# Chapter 10: Violence

The rod. The stick. The fist. This chapter's about violence—and why it always comes back around. Everyone trembles at harm. Everyone loves their life. Feel that in yourself, and you'll stop hurting others. Be like a broken gong—struck but making no angry sound. That's the path to peace.

## Verses 129 and 130: Everyone Trembles

The Buddha said:

"Everyone trembles at violence; everyone fears death. Comparing oneself with others, one should not strike or have others strike.

Everyone trembles at violence; for everyone, life is dear. Comparing oneself with others, one should not strike or have others strike."

And here's the Blues truth: Everyone trembles at the rod, at the stick. Everyone fears death. Nobody wants to be hit.

Compare yourself to others. Feel what THEY would feel. Then don't strike, don't have struck—that's the golden deal. Everyone loves their life. Knowing this, why would you bring them fear?

Buddhism's golden rule: feel how others feel, then act accordingly.

## Verses 131 and 132: Harm Brings No Peace

The Buddha said:

"One who harms with the rod beings who desire happiness, while seeking happiness for oneself, will find no happiness after death.

One who harms not with the rod beings who desire happiness, while seeking happiness for oneself, will find happiness after death."

And here's the Blues truth: All beings want happiness, just like you do. Hurt them with the rod? No happiness comes to you. After death, no peace—that's what the harmer gets. Seeking joy while causing pain is the worst of bets.

But don't harm with the rod. Don't hurt those who seek peace. After death, you find happiness. After death, release.

## Verses 133 and 134: The Broken Gong

The Buddha said:

"Speak no harsh word to anyone; spoken to, they may answer back. Arrogant talk brings misery, and they may strike you with the rod.

If you make no sound like a broken gong, you have attained Nibbāna—contention is not found in you."

And here's the Blues truth: Don't speak harsh. They might answer back. Arrogant talk brings misery. They might put you on the rack.

But here's the profound teaching: If someone strikes you and you make no sound—like a broken gong, struck but silence all around—you've reached Nibbāna. No contention in your heart. Struck but silent, struck but peaceful. That's the wise one's art.

The broken gong produces no sound when struck. This is active peace, not suppression.

## Verse 135: Old Age and Death Drive Us

The Buddha said:

"As a cowherd with a stick drives cattle to pasture, so do old age and death drive life out of beings."

And here's the Blues truth: Like a cowherd with a stick drives cattle to pasture ground—old age and death drive us all around. Inevitable, relentless, moving us toward the end.

Knowing this, what harm would you extend? We're all headed the same way. Why hurt each other on the road?

## Verses 137 through 140: Ten Bad Returns

The Buddha said:

"Whoever with the rod offends those who are inoffensive and harmless will quickly fall into one of ten states: harsh physical pain; loss of wealth; bodily breakdown; heavy affliction; loss of mind; danger from the king; terrible slander; loss of relatives; destruction of possessions; houses consumed by fire. And at death, that foolish one arises in the underworld."

And here's the Blues truth: Strike the harmless, hurt the pure? Ten bad things come your way:

Pain that's harsh. Loss of wealth. Body breaking down. Heavy sickness. Lose your mind. Kings bring you down. Slander terrible. Lose your kin. Possessions destroyed. Your house catches fire.

And when you die? The underworld. That's eleven for the price of violence. Karma returns these things.

## Verses 141 and 142: What Really Purifies

The Buddha said:

"Not going naked, nor matted hair, nor mud, nor fasting, nor lying on stony ground, nor dust and dirt, nor squatting exertions can purify one who has not removed doubt.

Even if adorned, if one is peaceful, trained, settled, living the holy life, having laid down the rod toward all beings—that one is a brahmin, an ascetic, a monastic."

And here's the Blues truth: Going naked won't purify you. Matted hair won't purify you. Mud, fasting, lying on rocks, dust, squatting—won't purify you if doubt is still in your heart.

But even wearing fine clothes, if you're peaceful, trained, and true, living the holy life, having laid down the rod toward ALL beings—THAT'S a brahmin. THAT'S an ascetic. THAT'S a monastic. Not the costume—the conduct.

## Verses 143, 144, and 145: Be Like the Good Horse

The Buddha said:

"Rare is the person in this world who is restrained by conscience, aware of their faults—like a good horse restrained by the whip.

Like a good horse touched by the whip, be ardent and spiritually intense. With faith, virtue, energy, concentration, and Dhamma investigation—with understanding, good conduct, and mindfulness—abandon this not-insignificant suffering.

Course-makers lead water; fletchers straighten arrows; carpenters straighten wood; the mild master themselves."

And here's the Blues truth: Rare is the person restrained by conscience inside—aware of their faults, like a good horse touched by the ride. The good horse needs only a light touch.

Be ardent, be intense. Faith, virtue, energy, concentration—Dhamma investigation. These qualities shape you.

Course-makers lead water. Fletchers straighten arrows. Carpenters straighten wood. The mild ones master themselves. Shape yourself like the craftsman shapes the raw. That's the highest law.

## End of Chapter 10

What we learned in these seventeen verses comes down to the golden rule of nonviolence. Everyone trembles at the rod—feel it, then don't strike. Everyone loves their life—respect that. Harm brings no happiness after death. Nonharm brings happiness. Harsh speech invites retaliation. Be like a broken gong—struck but silent. Old age and death drive us all—why add more pain? Ten bad outcomes for harming the harmless. External practices don't purify if doubt remains. Laying down the rod toward all beings—THAT'S holiness. Be like a good horse, responsive to conscience. Master yourself like craftsmen shape their materials.

Everyone trembles. Everyone fears. Knowing that—why bring more tears?
