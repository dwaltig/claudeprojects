# Chapter 22: Miscellaneous

This chapter's called Miscellaneous, but don't let that fool you. These are COLLECTED JEWELS—the teachings that didn't fit neatly into other boxes but are too precious to leave out. Think of it like the wise old man's pockets: whatever he pulls out is something you need right now.

## Verse 290: Trade Up, Not Down

The Buddha said:

"If by renouncing a small good one might see a greater good, the wise one should renounce that small good, seeing the more extensive good."

And here's the Blues truth: If you gotta give up something small to get something large, baby, make that trade. A wise one sees the big picture. Renounce the little good for the greater good ahead.

Don't clutch pennies when dollars are waiting. Don't hoard crumbs when the feast is set. The wise one knows when to let go of what's holding them back.

## Verse 291: Can't Build Happiness on Someone Else's Pain

The Buddha said:

"One who desires happiness for oneself by causing suffering for another, being thus associated with hatred, is not released from that hatred."

And here's the Blues truth: You want happiness for yourself by making someone else suffer? Listen here, friend—that's building your house on quicksand.

You get tangled up with hatred that way, and hatred don't let go easy. You think you're winning, but you're just binding yourself tighter to the very thing you hate. Can't be free from hatred while still dealing in hatred's business.

## Verses 292 and 293: What Needs Doing vs. What Doesn't

The Buddha said:

"That which should be done is cast aside, what should not be done is done instead—for the insolent and heedless, their pollutants increase.

But for those who properly undertake mindfulness of the body constantly, who do not practice what should not be done, persisting in what should be done—for those mindful, fully aware ones, the pollutants come to rest."

And here's the Blues truth: Here's how the pollutants GROW: You leave undone what needs doing, and do what doesn't need doing. Insolent. Heedless. Proud. Your spiritual pollution just keeps rising.

But here's how the pollutants DIE: Mindfulness of the body—keep it going. Don't practice what shouldn't be practiced. Persist in what SHOULD be done. The pollutants settle down like mud in still water.

## Verses 294 and 295: The Riddle of Destroying Mother and Father

The Buddha said:

"Having killed mother and father, and two warrior kings, having killed a kingdom with its followers, the brahmin proceeds untroubled.

Having killed mother and father, and two prosperous kings, having killed tiger as the fifth, the brahmin proceeds untroubled."

And here's the Blues truth: Now this sounds WILD. The Buddha telling us to kill folks? NAH, baby. Listen deeper.

MOTHER is craving. FATHER is conceit. The TWO KINGS are eternalism and annihilationism—wrong views on both sides. The KINGDOM is the sense-bases with their objects.

The second verse adds "a tiger as the fifth"—that's the five hindrances: Desire, ill-will, sloth, restlessness, doubt.

Destroy THOSE, and you walk free—untroubled, unburdened, awake. This is classic Buddhist encryption—outrageous statements that reveal profound meaning when decoded.

## Verses 296, 297, 298, 299, 300, and 301: The Six Recollections

The Buddha said:

"Gotama's disciples always awake to a good awakening—those who day and night constantly have mindfulness of the Buddha.

Gotama's disciples always awake to a good awakening—those who day and night constantly have mindfulness of the Dhamma.

Gotama's disciples always awake to a good awakening—those who day and night constantly have mindfulness of the Sangha.

Gotama's disciples always awake to a good awakening—those who day and night constantly have mindfulness of the body.

Gotama's disciples always awake to a good awakening—those who day and night have a mind delighting in non-violence.

Gotama's disciples always awake to a good awakening—those who day and night have a mind delighting in cultivation."

And here's the Blues truth: Six doors to waking well.

THE BUDDHA—Remembering the Awakened One, his qualities, his path, his victory. THE DHAMMA—Remembering the Teaching, visible here and now, inviting investigation. THE SANGHA—Remembering the Community, practicing well, worthy of respect. THE BODY—Remembering this body, breath by breath, step by step. NON-VIOLENCE—Delighting in harmlessness, at peace with all beings. CULTIVATION—Delighting in development, growing the wholesome, tending the garden of the mind.

Use them all, use them daily. THAT'S what Gotama's disciples do.

## Verse 302: Hard Either Way—Choose Your Hard

The Buddha said:

"The going forth is hard, it is hard to find delight therein; hard too are households, suffering to dwell within. Dwelling with those different is suffering; travelers in saṃsāra are beset by suffering. Therefore, do not be a traveler; do not be one beset by suffering."

And here's the Blues truth: Going forth is HARD. Finding delight in renunciation? HARD. But living in households? ALSO HARD. Being a traveler in this round of births? HARD.

Life is hard either way. You gonna suffer at home, you gonna struggle on the path. But one leads to freedom, and one keeps you spinning. So don't be a traveler forever. CHOOSE the hard that leads somewhere.

## Verses 303, 304, and 305: The Faithful Shine; The Good Shine; The Solitary Delight

The Buddha said:

"The faithful one endowed with virtue, possessed of wealth and fame—whatever district they resort to, right there they are worshipped.

The good are visible from afar, like a mountain covered in snow. The wicked are not seen here, like arrows shot in the night.

Sitting alone, lying down alone, walking alone, diligent—the solitary one who trains themselves will delight in the edge of the forest."

And here's the Blues truth: You got faith? You got virtue? You got wealth and a good name? Then wherever you go, you're honored right there. Integrity shines through.

THE GOOD shine from far away—like the Himalayas covered in snow. You can see 'em from miles off. But the WICKED? They're invisible—like arrows shot in the night. You don't see 'em till they hit.

Am I a snow-capped mountain? Or an arrow in the dark?

Sitting alone. Lying down alone. Walking alone. DILIGENT. The solitary one who trains oneself finds delight at the forest's edge. Not lonely—ALONE. Lonely is empty. Alone is FULL.

## End of Chapter 22

What we learned in these sixteen verses gives us collected jewels. Trade small pleasures for greater good. Can't build happiness on others' suffering. Leave undone what shouldn't be done; persist in what should. "Mother and father" means craving and conceit—destroy THOSE. Six Recollections: Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha, Body, Non-violence, Cultivation. Life is hard either way—choose the hard that leads to freedom. The faithful, virtuous one is honored everywhere. The good shine like snow-capped mountains from afar. The wicked are invisible like arrows shot in darkness. The solitary, diligent one finds joy at the forest's edge.

These are the collected jewels. Miscellaneous, maybe. But every one of them GOLD.
