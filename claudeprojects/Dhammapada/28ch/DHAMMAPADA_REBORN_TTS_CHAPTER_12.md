# Chapter 12: The Self

The self. Your best friend or your worst enemy. By yourself is evil done, by yourself are you defiled. By yourself is evil left undone, by yourself are you purified. Nobody—not mama, not a preacher, not a savior—can clean you up. That's the Buddha's radical truth: you do it yourself or it doesn't get done.

## Verses 157, 158, 159, and 160: Guard Yourself, Train Yourself

The Buddha said:

"If one regards oneself as dear, one should guard oneself well. During one of the three watches of night, the wise one should stay alert.

First establish oneself in what is suitable, then advise another. The wise one should not be defiled.

One should do oneself as one advises another. Being well-trained, one can train others—for the self is difficult to train.

The self is the friend of self—what other friend would there be? When the self is well-trained, one finds a friend hard to find."

And here's the Blues truth: If you love yourself, guard yourself right well. Watch through the night—the wise one stays alert.

First get yourself right, THEN teach somebody else. Train yourself first—then you got something to help. Self is hard to train, but do yourself what you teach. Be what you preach—that's how the teaching can reach.

The self is the friend of self—what other friend you got? No one can do the work for you. When you train yourself well, you find a friend worth having. The trained self becomes your own best companion.

## Verses 161 and 162: Evil Crushes Itself

The Buddha said:

"Evil done by oneself, born in oneself, arising in oneself, crushes the stupid one as a diamond crushes a rock-jewel.

One covered with exceeding lack of virtue, like a deadly creeper on a Sāl tree, makes oneself become what one's enemy wishes."

And here's the Blues truth: Evil done by yourself, born in you, rising in you—crushes the fool like diamond crushing through. External enemies unnecessary—you destroy yourself.

Like a vine on a Sāl tree, strangling what holds it up. Covering yourself with lack of virtue makes you your enemy's puppet. You become what your enemy wants when you strangle yourself with wrong.

## Verses 163, 164, and 165: No One Can Purify Another

The Buddha said:

"Easy to do are things not good, unbeneficial for oneself. But that which is beneficial and good is supremely hard to do.

Whoever reviles the noble teaching of the Arahants who live by Dhamma, that stupid one, depending on wicked views, brings about his own destruction—like bamboo that bears fruit.

By oneself alone is evil done; by oneself is one defiled. By oneself alone is evil not done; by oneself is one purified. Purity and impurity come from oneself—no one can purify another."

And here's the Blues truth: Easy to do what's no good. Easy to do what harms you. What's beneficial, what's right, what's true? THAT'S the hard thing to pursue.

Revile the teaching, mock the Dhamma, laugh at those who live it true—you bring destruction on yourself like bamboo when it fruits and dies.

BUT HERE'S THE DEEPEST TRUTH:

By yourself is evil done. By yourself are you defiled. By yourself is evil NOT done. By yourself are you purified.

Purity and impurity—they come from YOU alone. No one can purify another. NO ONE CAN PURIFY ANOTHER. This work is yours to own.

This is Buddhism's most radical ethical statement. No savior, no external purification—each person must do the work themselves.

## Verse 166: Know Your Own Good

The Buddha said:

"One should not neglect one's own good for another's, however great. Knowing what is good for oneself, one should be intent on that good."

And here's the Blues truth: Don't neglect your own good for another's, however great. Know what's good for you and be intent on that estate.

Take care of yourself first, so you can help somebody else. Not selfish—just wise. Put on your own oxygen mask first. Without self-cultivation, you can't truly help others.

## End of Chapter 12

What we learned in these ten verses comes down to radical self-responsibility. If you love yourself, guard yourself. Train yourself FIRST, then teach others. Self is the friend of self—what other friend is there? Self-done evil crushes like a diamond. Lack of virtue is a strangling vine. Easy to do what's wrong; hard to do what's right.

And the core teaching: BY YOURSELF is evil done, by yourself defiled. BY YOURSELF is evil NOT done, by yourself purified. NO ONE CAN PURIFY ANOTHER.

By yourself is the work done. By yourself is the freedom won. Nobody else—you do it or it doesn't get done.
