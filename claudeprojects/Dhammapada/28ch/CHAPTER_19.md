# Chapter 19: Impurity

Stains. Rust. Impurity. This chapter's central teaching: rust comes from iron and eats the iron it came from. Your own unwholesome deeds destroy YOU. But there's hope: the silversmith removes stains gradually, little by little. Make your island. Become wise. Ignorance is the supreme stain—abandon it.

## Verses 235, 236, 237, 238, and 239: Withered Leaf, Make Your Island

The Buddha said:

"You are now like a withered leaf; Yama's messengers stand waiting. You stand at decay's door—with no provisions for the journey.

Make an island for yourself! Quickly strive, become wise. Removing the stain, blemishless, you will reach the divine, noble realm.

You are now advanced in age; you have come to Yama's presence. There is nowhere to dwell between—with no provisions for the journey.

Make an island for yourself! Quickly strive, become wise. Removing the stain, blemishless, you will not come to birth and old age again.

The sage gradually, little by little, moment by moment, should remove the stain from himself—like a silversmith removes impurity from silver."

And here's the Blues truth: You're like a withered leaf now. Yama's messengers are at the door. Standing at decay's gate—with no provisions for what's in store.

MAKE YOUR ISLAND! Quickly strive, become wise. Remove the stain, become blemishless—then to the divine realm you'll rise.

You're advanced in age now. Come to Yama's very presence. Nowhere to dwell in between—no provisions for the journey hence.

MAKE YOUR ISLAND! Remove the stain—no more birth, no more age to arise.

The sage removes stains gradually, little by little, moment by moment—like a silversmith polishing silver. Patient, gradual purification.

## Verses 240, 241, 242, and 243: Rust Eats the Iron

The Buddha said:

"As rust arises from iron and eats away what it arose from, so one's own deeds lead the overindulgent to a bad destination.

Lack of repetition is the stain of mantras; lack of maintenance is the stain of homes; laziness is the stain of beauty; heedlessness is the stain of one on guard.

Bad conduct is a stain for women; stinginess is a giver's stain. Wicked deeds are stains in this world and the next.

Worse than those stains: ignorance is the supreme stain. Abandoning that stain, be stainless, O monastics!"

And here's the Blues truth: Rust comes from iron, then eats the iron it came from. Your own deeds work the same way—they destroy what they came from.

Stain of mantras: not repeating. Stain of houses: not maintaining. Stain of beauty: being lazy. Stain of the guard: not remaining alert.

Bad conduct stains. Stinginess stains. Wicked deeds are stains everywhere—this world and the next.

BUT—worse than all those stains: IGNORANCE is the supreme stain. Abandon that one. Be stainless. That's the aim.

## Verses 244, 245, 246, 247, and 248: Easy Life, Hard Life

The Buddha said:

"Life is easy for the shameless, bold as a crow, backbiting, reckless, living with defilements.

Life is hard for one with shame, constantly seeking purity, sincere, not reckless, seeing the pure life.

Whoever kills, speaks falsely, takes what is not given, goes to another's spouse, devotes himself to liquor—digs up his own root in this world.

Know this, dear friend: lack of restraint is a bad thing. Let not greed and corruption oppress you with suffering long."

And here's the Blues truth: Life is EASY for the shameless—bold as a crow, no care. Backbiting, reckless, defiled within.

But life is HARD for one with shame, constantly seeking purity. Sincere, not reckless, looking for the clean—that path requires more.

Who kills, who lies, who steals, who cheats, who goes to another's spouse, who drinks without restraint—DIGS UP HIS OWN ROOT. Breaking the five precepts destroys yourself.

Know this, friend: lack of restraint is bad. Don't let greed and corruption oppress you with suffering long.

## Verses 251, 252, 253, 254, and 255: Four Dangers, No Footprint

The Buddha said:

"No fire like passion; no seizing like hatred; no snare like delusion; no flood like craving.

Easy to see are others' faults; one's own is hard to see. One sifts others' faults like chaff but hides one's own like a crafty cheat.

Who constantly looks for others' faults, an abject complainer—for that one, pollutants increase; he is far from their destruction.

No footprint in the sky; no ascetic on the outside. Folk delight in impediments; the Tathāgatas are free of them.

No footprint in the sky; no ascetic on the outside. No conditions are eternal; no disturbance for the Buddhas."

And here's the Blues truth: Four dangers.

No fire like PASSION. No grip like HATRED. No snare like DELUSION. No flood like CRAVING.

Easy to see others' faults. Your own? Hard to find. You sift their faults like chaff but hide your own behind.

Who looks for others' faults all day, a constant complainer—the pollutants grow in that one. Liberation gets no nearer.

No footprint in the sky. No ascetic on the outside—true renunciation is internal. Folk love their impediments; Buddhas are free inside. No conditions last forever. No disturbance for the Buddhas—they've cut the final tether.

## End of Chapter 19

What we learned in these twenty-one verses confronts us with impurity and its cure. You're like a withered leaf—Yama's messengers are waiting. MAKE YOUR ISLAND for yourself. The silversmith removes stains gradually. Rust comes from iron and eats the iron. Ignorance is the SUPREME stain. Life is easy for the shameless; hard for the shame-aware. Breaking the precepts digs up your own root. No fire like passion, no grip like hatred, no snare like delusion, no flood like craving. Easy to see others' faults; hard to see your own. Looking for others' faults increases your pollutants. No footprint in the sky—Buddhas leave no trace.

Rust eats the iron it came from. Your deeds consume YOU. Polish yourself like silver—little by little, come through.
