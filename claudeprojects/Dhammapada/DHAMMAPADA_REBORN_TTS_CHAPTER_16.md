# Chapter 16: What Is Dear

Love. The sweetest thing—and the sharpest knife. From love comes grief. From love comes fear. This chapter traces the root: love, fondness, delight, desire, craving—all lead to the same place. But the one who lets go? No grief. No fear. How could there be?

## Verses 209, 210, and 211: Don't Cling

The Buddha said:

"Engaging in what is not suitable, not engaging in what is suitable, abandoning the good, grasping what is loved—one envies those who apply themselves.

Do not associate with those you love or with those you don't love—suffering comes from not seeing the loved and suffering from seeing the unloved.

Therefore, hold nothing as dear; losing what is loved is painful. There are no bonds for those who hold nothing as loved or unloved."

And here's the Blues truth: Grasping what you love, leaving what's good behind—you'll end up envying those who worked on their own mind.

Don't hold the loved ones too tight. Don't cling to enemies either. Not seeing the loved brings pain; seeing the hated—same fever.

So hold nothing as dear. Because losing what's loved is pain. No bonds exist for those who've dropped the loved/unloved game. Attachment guarantees eventual suffering.

## Verses 212, 213, 214, 215, and 216: Five Roots of Grief and Fear

The Buddha said:

"From love arises grief; from love arises fear. For one free from love, there is no grief—how could there be fear?

From fondness arises grief; from fondness arises fear. For one free from fondness, there is no grief—how could there be fear?

From delight arises grief; from delight arises fear. For one free from delight, there is no grief—how could there be fear?

From desire arises grief; from desire arises fear. For one free from desire, there is no grief—how could there be fear?

From craving arises grief; from craving arises fear. For one free from craving, there is no grief—how could there be fear?"

And here's the Blues truth: Five verses, same structure, same truth.

From LOVE comes grief. From LOVE comes fear. Free from love? No grief. How could there be fear?

From FONDNESS comes grief. From FONDNESS comes fear. Free from fondness? No grief. How could there be fear?

From DELIGHT comes grief. From DELIGHT comes fear. Free from delight? No grief. How could there be fear?

From DESIRE comes grief. From DESIRE comes fear. Free from desire? No grief. How could there be fear?

From CRAVING comes grief. From CRAVING comes fear. Free from craving? No grief. HOW COULD THERE BE FEAR?

Love, fondness, delight, desire, craving—five names for the same root. Cut the root, and grief and fear go moot.

## Verses 217, 218, 219, and 220: True Love Is Different

The Buddha said:

"One endowed with virtue and insight, principled, knowing the truths, doing one's own proper work—that one the people love.

One with desire for the undeclared, mind suffused with awakening, unattached to sense pleasures—is called 'one gone upstream.'

When one long absent returns safely from afar, relatives, friends, and companions rejoice. Just so, when one who has made merit goes from this world to the next, merit receives them like family welcoming a loved one home."

And here's the Blues truth: One with virtue and insight, principled, knowing truth, doing their proper work—THAT one the people love rightly.

One going upstream, mind touched by awakening, unattached to pleasure's stream—that's a different kind of love.

When someone long gone comes home safe, family rejoices at the door. Just so, when a merit-maker dies, merit welcomes them—and more. Like family at the gate, merit receives your soul. The good you've done becomes your kin when you cross to the final goal.

## End of Chapter 16

What we learned in these twelve verses traces grief and fear to their roots. Grasping the loved while leaving the good leads to envy. Hold nothing as dear—losing what's loved is painful. From LOVE comes grief and fear. From FONDNESS comes grief and fear. From DELIGHT comes grief and fear. From DESIRE comes grief and fear. From CRAVING comes grief and fear. Free from these, there's no grief, no fear.

But true admiration goes to the virtuous. And merit welcomes you home like family.

From love comes grief. From love comes fear. Let go of the grasping—and you're finally clear.
