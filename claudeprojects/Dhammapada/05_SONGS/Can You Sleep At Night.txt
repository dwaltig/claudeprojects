[Verse 1]
I've seen men with everything, the house, the car, the name
But they couldn't meet their own eyes in the mirror every day
Money in the bank but their soul account was overdrawn
Lying wide awake at 3 AM, waiting for the dawn

[Chorus]
Can you sleep at night
When the lights go down and you're alone
Can you sleep at night
With the seeds you've sown
'Cause the things you do follow you through
Every breath you take, they're watching too
Can you sleep at night
Tell me, can you sleep at night

[Verse 2]
I've seen folks with nothing but the shirt upon their back
Living in a way that don't leave nothing to regret
They look at how they've lived and there ain't no stain to see
Close their eyes in peace, that's how I want to be

[Chorus]
Can you sleep at night
When the lights go down and you're alone
Can you sleep at night
With the seeds you've sown
'Cause the things you do follow you through
Every breath you take, they're watching too
Can you sleep at night
Tell me, can you sleep at night

[Bridge]
Some folks lamenting here, gonna lament on the other side
Every dirty deed they did, can't run, can't hide
But the righteous ones rejoicing, both now and when they're gone
Looking at their life like a clear and honest song

[Verse 3]
Now I'm cleaning up my act, putting right what I did wrong
Trying to live a life that I can look back on
When I meet my maker or just close my eyes for sleep
I want nothing on my conscience, nothing buried deep

[Final Chorus]
I can sleep at night
When the lights go down and I'm alone
I can sleep at night
Reaping what I've sown
'Cause I'm living clean, nothing in between
Me and my reflection, if you know what I mean
I can sleep at night
Yeah, I can finally sleep at night

[Outro]
You know, this ain't about scaring nobody with hellfire.
It's just the truth.
You're gonna have to look at yourself.
Here. Now. At the end.
So the question isn't what you can get away with.
The question is, What can you live with?
What can you die with?
Can you sleep at night?
