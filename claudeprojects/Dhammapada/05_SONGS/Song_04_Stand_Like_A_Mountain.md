# Stand Like a Mountain

**Dhammapada Verses 7-8 | Blues Song by Sister Ray Johnson**

---

## The Teaching

Verses 7-8 contrast two lives: the weak tree and the mountain. Verse 7 describes those who chase every pleasure, let their senses run wild, eat without limits, and slack on the work—Māra (delusion, temptation, death) topples them like wind blowing down a rotted tree. Verse 8 describes those who contemplate the truth beneath the pretty surface, restrain their senses, know moderation, build faith and energy—they stand unmoved like a mountain of rock against any wind.

**Pali Source (key lines):**
- *"Subhānupassiṁ viharantaṁ, indriyesu asaṁvutaṁ, bhojanamhi amattaññuṁ, kusītaṁ hīnavīriyaṁ—taṁ ve pasahati Māro vāto rukkhaṁ va dubbalaṁ."* — Living contemplating what is pleasant, uncontrolled in sense faculties, not knowing the limit in food, indolent, low in energy—Māra surely overthrows that one, like wind overthrows a weak tree.
- *"Asubhānupassiṁ viharantaṁ, indriyesu susaṁvutaṁ, bhojanamhi ca mattaññuṁ, saddhaṁ āraddhavīriyaṁ—taṁ ve nappasahati Māro vāto selaṁ va pabbataṁ."* — Living contemplating the unpleasant, well-controlled in sense faculties, knowing the limit in food, faithful, with energy aroused—Māra does not overthrow that one, just as wind does not overthrow a mountain made of rock.

## The Song

### [Verse 1]
I knew a man who chased every shiny thing in sight
Pretty faces, fast money, parties every night
Eyes wide open but he couldn't see the cliff
Living for the high with no strength to lift

### [Chorus]
You gotta stand like a mountain, baby
When that wind starts to blow
You gotta stand like a mountain
Let the storm rage, let it go
Some folks fall like weak trees
Māra takes them down low
But if you built it right, you built it deep
You stand like a mountain in the snow

### [Verse 2]  
Screens glow blue, feeds telling you what you need
Every dopamine hit is planting poison seed
No restraint on the appetite, no limit on the scroll
All that pretty empty filling up a hungry hole

### [Chorus]
You gotta stand like a mountain, baby
When that wind starts to blow
You gotta stand like a mountain
Let the storm rage, let it go
Some folks fall like weak trees
Māra takes them down low
But if you built it right, you built it deep
You stand like a mountain in the snow

### [Bridge]
Train your eyes to see beneath the surface shine
Know when enough's enough—that wisdom's worth more than wine
Put in the work when nobody's watching you
Build your roots down deep, and no storm's getting through

### [Verse 3]
Every morning I get up, I do the hardest thing
Face the truth about myself before I hear the bells ring
Keep my senses on a leash, know my limits well
Building strength for when the tempests come—and oh, they will

### [Final Chorus]
So I stand like a mountain, baby
When that wind starts to blow
I stand like a mountain
Let the storm rage, let it go
Weak trees falling all around me
Māra trying to take me down below
But I built it right, I built it deep
I stand like a mountain in the snow

### [Outro - Spoken]
*You can't control the storm, but you can control what you're made of.
Build your roots deep. Train yourself strong.
When Māra comes—and she always comes—
you'll be standing while the weak trees fall.*

## Notes on the Blues

This song speaks directly to America's addiction epidemic—not just substances, but screens, shopping, gambling, doom-scrolling. The "shiny things" are everywhere now, algorithmically tuned to exploit our unguarded senses. The Buddha's teaching here is about discipline, moderation, and building inner strength BEFORE the storm hits.

**Contemporary resonance:**
- Social media and attention addiction
- Consumer culture's constant temptation
- The gig economy exhaustion that leaves no energy for self-care
- Building resilience in an age of instant gratification

The "mountain vs. weak tree" image translates perfectly to Blues: you've either done the work or you haven't, and the storm reveals which one you are.

## Notes on the Dharma

**Verse 7** describes the untrained person: *subhānupassiṁ* (contemplating the pleasant/beautiful), *asaṁvutaṁ* (unrestrained senses), *amattaññuṁ* (not knowing limits), *kusītaṁ* (lazy), *hīnavīriyaṁ* (weak effort). Māra represents whatever topples us—temptation, delusion, death itself.

**Verse 8** describes the trained practitioner: *asubhānupassiṁ* (contemplating the unpleasant reality beneath surfaces), *susaṁvutaṁ* (well-restrained senses), *mattaññuṁ* (knowing limits), *saddhaṁ* (faithful), *āraddhavīriyaṁ* (aroused energy). The mountain of rock (*selaṁ pabbataṁ*) cannot be moved.

This is Buddhism's practical psychology: build yourself BEFORE crisis comes.

## Clean Lyrics for Suno

```
[Verse 1]
I knew a man who chased every shiny thing in sight
Pretty faces, fast money, parties every night
Eyes wide open but he couldn't see the cliff
Living for the high with no strength to lift

[Chorus]
You gotta stand like a mountain, baby
When that wind starts to blow
You gotta stand like a mountain
Let the storm rage, let it go
Some folks fall like weak trees
Māra takes them down low
But if you built it right, you built it deep
You stand like a mountain in the snow

[Verse 2]
Screens glow blue, feeds telling you what you need
Every dopamine hit is planting poison seed
No restraint on the appetite, no limit on the scroll
All that pretty empty filling up a hungry hole

[Chorus]
You gotta stand like a mountain, baby
When that wind starts to blow
You gotta stand like a mountain
Let the storm rage, let it go
Some folks fall like weak trees
Māra takes them down low
But if you built it right, you built it deep
You stand like a mountain in the snow

[Bridge]
Train your eyes to see beneath the surface shine
Know when enough's enough, that wisdom's worth more than wine
Put in the work when nobody's watching you
Build your roots down deep, and no storm's getting through

[Verse 3]
Every morning I get up, I do the hardest thing
Face the truth about myself before I hear the bells ring
Keep my senses on a leash, know my limits well
Building strength for when the tempests come, and oh, they will

[Final Chorus]
So I stand like a mountain, baby
When that wind starts to blow
I stand like a mountain
Let the storm rage, let it go
Weak trees falling all around me
Māra trying to take me down below
But I built it right, I built it deep
I stand like a mountain in the snow

[Outro]
You can't control the storm, but you can control what you're made of
Build your roots deep. Train yourself strong.
When Māra comes, and she always comes
you'll be standing while the weak trees fall
```

## SoundCloud Description

**Stand Like a Mountain**
*The William Altig Choir*

🎵 **Dhammapada Blues Series – Song 4 (Verses 7-8)**

The Buddha taught about two kinds of people: weak trees and mountains.

Weak trees chase every pleasure, let their senses run wild, don't know when enough is enough, slack on the work. When the storm comes—and it always comes—they go down hard. Māra (temptation, delusion, death) knocks them flat.

Mountains are different. They trained themselves. Restrained their senses. Know their limits. Did the work when nobody was watching. When that same storm hits? They don't move. Not an inch.

This song is for everyone fighting addiction—to substances, screens, shopping, scrolling, whatever your poison is. The storm's coming. What are you made of?

Driving blues with gospel fire. A song for building yourself before the tempest hits.

## Facebook Post (Marcus "Echo" Thompson)

This song came from watching people I love get knocked down by the same storms over and over—addiction, bad relationships, doom-scrolling at 3 AM, their own minds turning against them.

The Buddha taught about two kinds of people: weak trees and mountains.

Weak trees chase every pleasure, let their senses run wild, never build their roots. When life's storm hits—and it always hits—they go down hard.

Mountains are different. They trained themselves before the storm came. Restrained their senses. Did the hard work when nobody was watching. When that same wind blows? They don't move. Not an inch.

"You can't control the storm, but you can control what you're made of."

This one's for anyone who's rebuilding. Who's tired of falling. Who's finally ready to stand.

What are you building today? 🏔️

The Buddha taught about two kinds of people: weak trees and mountains.

Weak trees chase every pleasure, let their senses run wild, never build their roots. When life's storm hits—and it always hits—they go down hard. Māra (temptation, delusion, destruction) knocks them flat.

Mountains are different. They trained themselves BEFORE the storm came. Restrained their senses. Did the hard work when nobody was watching. Built their roots deep.

When that same wind blows? They don't move. Not an inch.

This song is for everyone fighting addiction—to substances, screens, shopping, scrolling, whatever your poison is. The storm's coming. What are you made of?

**Caption:**

You can't control the storm.
But you can control what you're made of. 🏔️

Some folks fall like weak trees—
chasing every shiny thing,
senses running wild,
no roots built deep.

When Māra comes (and she always comes),
they go down hard.

But mountains? Mountains trained themselves
BEFORE the storm hit.

This song is for anyone rebuilding.
Anyone tired of falling.
Anyone finally ready to stand.

What are you building today?
