[Verse 1]
I chased every pleasure, drank the bottle dry
Thought if I felt good enough the pain would finally die
Then I swung the other way, starved myself to bone
Whipped my body, cursed my flesh, sat on nails alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Both roads led to nowhere, both fires burned me down
I was lost in the extremes til I heard a different sound

[Chorus]
Walk the middle road, child, not too tight, not too loose
Walk the middle road, that's where you find the truth
Don't drown in your pleasures, don't beat yourself to death
Walk the middle road and catch your breath

[Verse 2]
See right, think straight, speak kind, act clean
Work honest, try hard, pay attention to the scene
Train your mind to settle, let it rest in one good place
Eight steps on the highway, eight gates to grace

[Chorus]
Walk the middle road, child, not too tight, not too loose
Walk the middle road, that's where you find the truth
Don't drown in your pleasures, don't beat yourself to death
Walk the middle road and catch your breath

[Bridge]
The Blues is real, birth is hard, death is harder still
Getting sick, growing old, wanting what you never will
Where's it come from? That craving in your chest
That thirst that never quits, that hunger never blessed

But here's the good news, baby, the fire don't have to burn
The wheel can stop its spinning if you're willing to learn
Let the craving go and liberation comes
Walk the eight-step highway til the journey's done

[Final Chorus]
Walk the middle road, child, not too tight, not too loose
Walk the middle road, that's where you find the truth
Don't chase every pleasure, don't punish your own soul
Walk the middle road and you'll finally be whole

[Outro]
Five brothers sat at the Deer Park that day
One of them got it, right then, right there
And the wheel of the Dharma started turning
It's still turning, honey. It's turning for you.
Find your middle road.
