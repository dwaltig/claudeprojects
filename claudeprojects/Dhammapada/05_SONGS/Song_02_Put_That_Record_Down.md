# Put That Record Down

**Dhammapada Verses 3-4 | Blues Song by Sister Ray Johnson**

---

## The Teaching
Verses 3-4 warn about looping grievances: keep replaying "he abused me, he robbed me" and hate keeps burning; set the record down and the fire cools. The choice is in what you rehearse.

**Pali Source (key line):** *“Yo n’etaṁ upanayhati, veraṁ tesaṁ na sammati.”* — For those who **don’t dwell on it**, the hatred settles.

## The Song

### [Verse 1]
Sat up in the kitchen with the lights down low
Old hurt spinning like a late-night show
"He talked bad about me, took what I earned"
Needle in the groove where the anger burns

### [Chorus]
Put that record down, let the hate lie down
Set the vinyl on the shelf, let the needle rest now
You can sing that pain forever, but it never makes you free
Put that record down, let your heart get out the key

### [Verse 2]
Screens glow blue, feeding all your doubt
Same five memories keep wearing you out
"She betrayed me, left me, broke my name"
Playing it on loop like it's earning you fame

### [Chorus]
Put that record down, let the hate lie down
Set the vinyl on the shelf, let the needle rest now
You can sing that pain forever, but it never makes you free
Put that record down, let your heart get out the key

### [Bridge]
You ain't denying what happened, you're just choosing what you feed
You can water thorns all evening or plant a kinder seed
Hate is a squatter—stop paying the rent
Drop the stylus, walk away, that's how the fury's spent

### [Verse 3]
Morning sun creeping, whole house still
Coffee steam rising, quiet on the sill
You breathe in mercy, breathe out the fight
Let the track go silent—feel the room fill with light

### [Final Chorus]
Put that record down, let the hate lie down
Set the vinyl on the shelf, let the needle rest now
You can sing that pain forever, but it never makes you free
Put that record down—leave the loop, step into peace

## Clean Lyrics for Suno
```
[Verse 1]
Sat up in the kitchen with the lights down low
Old hurt spinning like a late-night show
He talked bad about me, took what I earned
Needle in the groove where the anger burns

[Chorus]
Put that record down, let the hate lie down
Set the vinyl on the shelf, let the needle rest now
You can sing that pain forever, but it never makes you free
Put that record down, let your heart get out the key

[Verse 2]
Screens glow blue, feeding all your doubt
Same five memories keep wearing you out
She betrayed me, left me, broke my name
Playing it on loop like it's earning you fame

[Chorus]
Put that record down, let the hate lie down
Set the vinyl on the shelf, let the needle rest now
You can sing that pain forever, but it never makes you free
Put that record down, let your heart get out the key

[Bridge]
You ain't denying what happened, you're just choosing what you feed
You can water thorns all evening or plant a kinder seed
Hate is a squatter, stop paying the rent
Drop the stylus, walk away, that's how the fury's spent

[Verse 3]
Morning sun creeping, whole house still
Coffee steam rising, quiet on the sill
You breathe in mercy, breathe out the fight
Let the track go silent, feel the room fill with light

[Final Chorus]
Put that record down, let the hate lie down
Set the vinyl on the shelf, let the needle rest now
You can sing that pain forever, but it never makes you free
Put that record down, leave the loop, step into peace

## SoundCloud Description

**Put That Record Down**
*The William Altig Choir*

🎵 **Dhammapada Blues Series – Song 2 (Verses 3-4)**

The Buddha said: "He abused me, he struck me, he defeated me, he robbed me"—for those who dwell on such thoughts, hatred is never appeased. For those who don't dwell? The hatred settles.

This song is about that record player in your head—the one that keeps spinning the same old hurt on repeat. You didn't choose what happened to you, but you do choose whether to keep rehearsing it.

Slow Chicago blues shuffle. Warm tube amp. Midnight bar feel. A song for anyone who's ready to lift the needle and let the room go quiet.

You ain't denying what happened. You're just choosing what you feed.

🙏 Part of the **Dhammapada Reborn** project—ancient Buddhist wisdom transmitted through American Blues.

**Short Description:**
That record player in your head—the one spinning the same old hurt on repeat? It's time to lift the needle. 🎵

**Full Description:**

Sat up in the kitchen with the lights down low...

We all have that mental record player. The one that keeps spinning: "He talked bad about me. She betrayed me. They took what was mine." Round and round, wearing the same groove deeper.

The Buddha called this out 2,500 years ago: for those who dwell on such thoughts, hatred is never appeased. But for those who don't dwell? The hatred settles.

This isn't about denying what happened. You're not pretending away the hurt. You're just choosing what to feed. You can water thorns all evening—or plant a kinder seed.

Put that record down. Let the room go quiet. Feel the light come in.
