I knew a man who burned from the inside out
Couldn't escape the things that he'd done
Every quiet moment, that fire would start
I did that evil and the burning had begun

He tried to run, tried to hide, tried to drink it away
But the flames just followed him down
And when the consequences finally came around
That fire burned him to the ground

The fire don't quit, no it just gets higher
What you plant today, tomorrow grows the fire
You can't outrun the heat of what you've done
The fire don't quit until you're overcome
But flip that script and plant the good
Watch the joy grow like it should
What you give out comes back twice
The fire don't quit, make sure it's the right fire

I knew a woman who glowed from the inside out
Everything she touched turned to gold
Not cause of luck or magic or some cosmic deal
But cause her hands were clean and her heart was whole

She'd think about the good she'd done and smile
I helped that stranger, I told the truth
And when the blessings came back around to her
She had joy piled high to the roof

The fire don't quit, no it just gets higher
What you plant today, tomorrow grows the fire
You can't outrun the heat of what you've done
The fire don't quit until you're overcome
But flip that script and plant the good
Watch the joy grow like it should
What you give out comes back twice
The fire don't quit, make sure it's the right fire

Karma ain't punishment from the sky
It's the law of the harvest, the truth that don't lie
Burn now, burn later, burn even more
Or rejoice now, rejoice later, joy through every door
The seeds you're planting today
Are gonna grow either way
So choose what you're growing
Cause the fire keeps on flowing

So I'm checking my hands before I move
Checking my heart before I speak
Cause I know that whatever fire I'm starting
Is the fire I'm gonna feel

If burning's what's coming, I'll change my ways
If joy's what I'm after, I know the path
Plant good seeds, think good thoughts
And let that joy compound and last

The fire don't quit, but I'm choosing my flame
What I plant today won't bring me shame
I can't outrun the seeds I've sown
But I can choose what fire I've grown
So I flip that script and plant the good
Watch the blessing grow like it should
What I give out comes back with love
The fire I'm burning lights me up

You see, this ain't about scaring nobody.
He was just telling you how it works.
Your actions compound.
Your consequences grow.
The question isn't whether there's gonna be a fire.
The question is, what kind of fire are you building?
A fire that burns you down?
Or a fire that lights your way?
The fire don't quit.
Make sure it's the right one.
