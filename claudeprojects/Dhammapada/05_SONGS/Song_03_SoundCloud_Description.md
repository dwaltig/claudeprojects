# We All Running Out of Time - SoundCloud Description

**We All Running Out of Time**
*The William Altig Choir*

🎵 **Dhammapada Blues Series – Song 3 (Verses 5-6)**

The Buddha said: "Hatred never ceases by hatred—only by non-hatred does it end. This is the eternal law."

And then he reminded us: "Others do not understand that here, we are perishing."

This song is about letting go of the grudges you've been carrying. Not because the people who hurt you deserve it—but because your time is too precious to waste on hate. We're all running out of time. Every tick of the clock is yours and mine.

Warm acoustic gospel blues. Resonator guitar. Brushed drums. A choir lifting you on the final chorus. This one's for anyone who's been holding onto bitterness longer than they should.

Here's my loving trick for you tonight: stop fighting fire with fire. Meet hate with something softer, something wiser. Your time is precious, baby. Don't waste it being angry.

We running out of time... so love while you can.

🙏 Part of the **Dhammapada Reborn** project—ancient Buddhist wisdom transmitted through American Blues.
