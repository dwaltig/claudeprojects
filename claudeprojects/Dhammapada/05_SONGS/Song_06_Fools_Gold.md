# Fool's Gold

**Dhammapada Verses 11-12 | Blues Song by Sister Ray Johnson**

---

## The Teaching

Verses 11-12 hit you with a question older than money itself: Do you know the difference between what shines and what's actually valuable? Between the hype and the real thing?

The Buddha uses a carpenter's eye here: *sāra* is heartwood—the dense, strong core of a tree that lasts for centuries. *Asāra* is sapwood—the soft outer layers that look just as good but rot away fast. Most folks can't tell the difference until it's too late. They're out here chasing sapwood thinking it's the good stuff.

Same goes for life. People mistake:
- Pleasure for happiness
- Money for security
- Fame for worth
- Comfort for peace
- Information for wisdom

They run after the sparkle, never asking what's underneath. And they never find what they actually need—because they're looking in the wrong place.

But the wise ones? They can tell fool's gold from real gold. They know what actually matters and go after THAT. And they find it.

**Pali Source (key lines):**
- *"Asāre sāramatino, sāre cāsāradassino, te sāraṁ nādhigacchanti, micchāsaṅkappagocarā."* — Those who mistake the non-essential for the essential, and the essential for the non-essential—they do not reach the essential, their thoughts moving in the wrong pasture.
- *"Sārañ-ca sārato ñatvā, asārañ-ca asārato, te sāraṁ adhigacchanti, sammāsaṅkappagocarā."* — But knowing the essential as essential, and the non-essential as non-essential, they reach the essential, their thoughts moving in the right pasture.

## The Song

### [Verse 1]
Spent my whole life chasing diamonds made of glass
Thought I found the treasure but it never seemed to last
Gold watch on my wrist but my soul was running broke
All that shiny promise turned to ash and turned to smoke

### [Chorus]
Fool's gold, fool's gold
Looks just like the real thing but it leaves you in the cold
Everybody selling what they swear is gonna shine
But the wise know the difference every single time
Fool's gold, fool's gold
What you chasing baby, is it worth your soul?

### [Verse 2]
They say get the corner office, get the house up on the hill
Get the followers and fame and then you'll finally get your fill
But I've seen rich folks crying in their marble halls at night
All that sapwood living when they needed heartwood right

### [Chorus]
Fool's gold, fool's gold
Looks just like the real thing but it leaves you in the cold
Everybody selling what they swear is gonna shine
But the wise know the difference every single time
Fool's gold, fool's gold
What you chasing baby, is it worth your soul?

### [Bridge]
There's heartwood in the center and there's sapwood too
One's gonna last forever, one's gonna rot right through
You can spend your whole life feeding at the wrong trough
Or you can learn to tell the real from the payoff

### [Verse 3]
Now I'm looking for the lasting things that money cannot buy
Peace that doesn't fade away and truth that doesn't lie
Freedom over pleasure, wisdom over noise
Character that's solid when the world takes all your toys

### [Final Chorus]
Real gold, real gold
That's what I'm after now, worth more than I been told
Ain't no advertisement gonna fool me anymore
I know what I'm looking for, I know what life is for
Real gold, real gold
I finally know the difference, and I'm coming home whole

### [Outro - Spoken]
*They got a whole world trying to sell you sapwood, friend.
Trying to tell you the shine is the substance.
But you can learn to see it—the difference between what glitters and what's gold.
Between what they're selling and what you actually need.
I had to learn this the hard way.
Maybe you don't have to.*

## Notes on the Blues

This song channels the American experience of being sold a bill of goods—the promise that success, wealth, and status will fill the void. From the Great Gatsby to today's influencer culture, we've always been seduced by shine over substance.

**Contemporary resonance:**
- Consumer culture's empty promises
- Social media's curated illusions
- The "hustle culture" burnout
- Midlife awakening to what actually matters
- The difference between success and fulfillment
- Buying experiences vs. buying meaning

The Blues has always been the music of people who learned the hard way what matters. This song is testimony from someone who chased the shine and found it hollow—and finally learned to tell the difference.

## Notes on the Dharma

**Verse 11** introduces the concept of *micchāsaṅkappa* (wrong intention/thought)—the mind that's been trained by culture to value the wrong things. When you're grazing in the wrong pasture (*gocara*), you never find real nourishment.

**Verse 12** offers *sammāsaṅkappa* (right intention)—part of the Noble Eightfold Path. The wise don't just stumble onto truth; they *ñatvā* (know, discern, discriminate). This is trained wisdom, not luck.

The heartwood/sapwood metaphor (*sāra/asāra*) comes from ancient Indian carpentry. A skilled woodworker knows which part of the tree to use. A skilled practitioner knows which values to pursue.

## Suno Production Brief (Marcus "Groove" Washington)

**Emotion:** Hard-won wisdom, testimonial regret turning to resolve, the satisfaction of finally seeing clearly.
**Tempo/Feel:** 72-78 BPM, slow-burning blues shuffle with gospel undercurrents. Let it breathe. This is a song about learning, not rushing.
**Palette:** Classic Chicago blues with a hint of soul. Electric guitar with sweet sustain, Hammond B3 filling the spaces, solid bass holding it down, drums with a patient pocket. Think B.B. King meets Al Green.
**Vocal:** Weathered male voice with gravitas—someone who's been around the block and finally figured it out. Think Bobby "Blue" Bland or contemporary: Gary Clark Jr. in his contemplative mode. Not flashy—wise.

## Clean Lyrics for Suno

```
[Verse 1]
Spent my whole life chasing diamonds made of glass
Thought I found the treasure but it never seemed to last
Gold watch on my wrist but my soul was running broke
All that shiny promise turned to ash and turned to smoke

[Chorus]
Fools gold, fools gold
Looks just like the real thing but it leaves you in the cold
Everybody selling what they swear is gonna shine
But the wise know the difference every single time
Fools gold, fools gold
What you chasing baby, is it worth your soul

[Verse 2]
They say get the corner office, get the house up on the hill
Get the followers and fame and then you'll finally get your fill
But I've seen rich folks crying in their marble halls at night
All that sapwood living when they needed heartwood right

[Chorus]
Fools gold, fools gold
Looks just like the real thing but it leaves you in the cold
Everybody selling what they swear is gonna shine
But the wise know the difference every single time
Fools gold, fools gold
What you chasing baby, is it worth your soul

[Bridge]
There's heartwood in the center and there's sapwood too
One's gonna last forever, one's gonna rot right through
You can spend your whole life feeding at the wrong trough
Or you can learn to tell the real from the payoff

[Verse 3]
Now I'm looking for the lasting things that money cannot buy
Peace that doesn't fade away and truth that doesn't lie
Freedom over pleasure, wisdom over noise
Character that's solid when the world takes all your toys

[Final Chorus]
Real gold, real gold
That's what I'm after now, worth more than I been told
Ain't no advertisement gonna fool me anymore
I know what I'm looking for, I know what life is for
Real gold, real gold
I finally know the difference, and I'm coming home whole

[Outro]
They got a whole world trying to sell you sapwood, friend.
Trying to tell you the shine is the substance.
But you can learn to see it, the difference between what glitters and what's gold.
Between what they're selling and what you actually need.
I had to learn this the hard way.
Maybe you don't have to.

## Cover Art Brief (Deja "Vision" Williams)

### Song Essence
The visual tension between what glitters and what's gold—the seduction of superficial shine versus the quiet solidity of real value.

### Visual Concept
A split composition: On one side, a pile of glittering but fake gold (pyrite, fool's gold) under harsh artificial light—flashy but cold. On the other side, a single piece of real gold, perhaps a nugget or a simple ring, under warm natural light—humble but radiating genuine warmth.

**Alternative:** A cross-section of a tree showing the dark, dense heartwood core versus the lighter, softer sapwood outer rings. The heartwood glows with subtle inner light.

**Alternative 2:** Hands holding two objects—one gaudy and glittering, one simple but clearly precious. The choice visible in the gesture.

### Color Palette
- Pyrite yellow (cold, artificial shine)
- True gold (warm, deep)
- Deep browns (heartwood)
- Cream/tan (sapwood)
- Rich shadows (clarity)
- Warm amber light (wisdom)

### Typography Direction
Clean, confident serif font—something that looks timeless rather than trendy. The title should feel like a truth that's been known for centuries.

```

```

### Option B: Heartwood Cross-Section
```
album cover, cross-section of ancient tree trunk, dark dense heartwood center glowing with subtle warm light, lighter sapwood outer rings, natural texture, contemplative mood, earth tones, blues soul album aesthetic, symbolic of essence versus surface
```

### Option C: The Choice
```
album cover, weathered hands holding two objects, one gaudy glittering fake jewelry, one simple gold band, warm directional light, intimate close-up, vintage photography, blues aesthetic, theme of discernment and wisdom
```

## SoundCloud Description (Maya "Ink" Reynolds)

**Fool's Gold**
*The William Altig Choir*

🎵 **Blues Testimony**

Can you tell the difference between what shines and what's actually valuable?

Old carpenters know: heartwood versus sapwood. The outside of the tree looks solid, but it rots fast. The core looks plain, but it lasts for centuries. Most people can't tell the difference until it's too late.

Same goes for life. We're out here chasing:
- Pleasure instead of happiness
- Money instead of security
- Fame instead of worth
- Comfort instead of peace

This song is for everyone who's ever woken up with everything they were told to want—and realized it wasn't what they needed.

I had to learn this the hard way. Maybe you don't have to.

## Facebook Post (Marcus "Echo" Thompson)

Can you tell the difference between what shines and what's actually gold?

I spent years chasing diamonds made of glass. Gold watch on my wrist, soul running broke. Looked successful, felt empty.

Old carpenters know: heartwood versus sapwood. The pretty outside of the tree rots in a few years. The plain-looking core lasts for centuries. Most folks grab the wrong part.

Same with life. We chase:
- Pleasure thinking it's happiness
- Money thinking it's security  
- Fame thinking it's worth
- Comfort thinking it's peace

We end up with sapwood lives—shiny on the outside, hollow inside.

This song is for everyone who's learning to tell the difference. For everyone who's done chasing fool's gold.

What did you spend years chasing that turned out to be worthless? What's the real gold you finally found? 🪙

I had to learn this the hard way. Maybe you don't have to.

Spent my whole life chasing diamonds made of glass...

Can you tell the difference between what shines and what's actually valuable?

Old carpenters know: heartwood versus sapwood. The outside of the tree looks solid but rots fast. The core looks plain but lasts for centuries. Most people grab the wrong part and wonder why their lives fall apart.

We're out here chasing:
- Corner offices that leave us empty
- Followers who don't really know us
- Success that never feels like enough

This song is testimony from someone who learned the hard way. For everyone waking up to what actually matters.

**Caption:**

Fool's gold. 🪙

Spent years chasing diamonds made of glass.
Gold watch on my wrist,
soul running broke.

Most folks can't tell
heartwood from sapwood.
They grab the shiny outside,
not knowing it'll rot.

We chase pleasure thinking it's happiness.
Money thinking it's security.
Fame thinking it's worth.

All that sapwood living
when we needed heartwood right.

But the wise learn to see.
Real gold doesn't need to advertise.
