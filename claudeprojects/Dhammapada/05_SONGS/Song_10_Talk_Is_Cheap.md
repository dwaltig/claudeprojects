# Talk Is Cheap

**Dhammapada Verses 19-20 | Blues Song by Sister Ray Johnson**

---

## The Teaching

The Buddha closes Chapter 1 with a reality check: you can quote all the scriptures in the world, but if you're not doing the work—if you're just counting other people's cattle instead of tending your own—you're missing the point.

Verse 19: The heedless person who recites abundant scriptures but doesn't practice is like a cowboy counting someone else's cattle. He doesn't partake of the ascetic life.

Verse 20: But the person who recites even just a few scriptures yet lives righteously according to the Dhamma—abandoning greed, hate, and delusion, with right understanding and a well-released mind—THAT person partakes of the ascetic life.

Talk is cheap. Practice is everything.

## The Song

### [Verse 1]
You know every verse, every chapter, every line
Quote the scripture forwards, backwards, every time
But when it comes to living what you preach
Your hands are empty and your walk don't match your speech

### [Chorus]
Talk is cheap, baby, where's your proof?
You counting other people's cattle from the roof
Quoting wisdom but you ain't set free
Talk is cheap—show me what you BE

### [Verse 2]
Maybe you don't know much, maybe just a few
But you living what you learned, walking what is true
Let go of greed, let go of hate
Let go of confusion—that's how you liberate

### [Chorus]
Talk is cheap, honey, where's the change?
You got all the answers but your life's the same
Quoting dharma but you still ain't free
Talk is cheap—show me what you BE

### [Bridge]
The cowboy counting someone else's herd
Ain't got no cattle of his own—just words
But the one who tends what's right in front of him
That's the one who's living free within

Understanding right, mind released from chains
Not clinging here or there, breaking free from pain
That's the one who walks the path for real
Not just talking 'bout the dharma—living what they feel

### [Verse 3]
So I'm checking my own walk before I check my talk
Am I living free or just going through the motions when I walk?
Am I letting go or holding tight?
Am I free inside or just quoting what sounds right?

### [Final Chorus]
Talk is cheap, and I know the score
It ain't about the words—it's what you're living for
Abandon greed and hate, walk in clarity
Talk is cheap—I'm gonna BE what's free

### [Outro - Spoken]
You can recite every teaching.
Know every verse by heart.
But if you're still clinging,
still caught in greed and hatred,
still confused—
you're just counting someone else's cattle.

The path isn't what you know.
It's what you've let go.

Talk is cheap.
Walk is everything.

## Notes on the Blues

This is the ultimate hypocrisy check, and the Blues has been doing this forever—calling out people who talk righteous but live wrong. Think of every Blues song about preachers with six women on the side, about politicians promising change while stealing everything.

The image of "counting other people's cattle" is perfect American Blues imagery—someone watching someone else's wealth while they got nothing of their own. You're studying everyone else's liberation while staying chained yourself.

**Contemporary resonance:**
- Social media spirituality—posting quotes while living toxic
- Self-help addiction without actual change
- Spiritual bypassing—talking enlightenment, avoiding shadow work
- "Thoughts and prayers" without action
- Performative activism vs. real commitment
- Knowledge collectors vs. practitioners

## Notes on the Dharma

**Verse 19**: *Bahum-pi ce sahitaṁ bhāsamāno* (even though reciting abundant scriptures), *na takkaro hoti naro pamatto* (the heedless person who doesn't do/practice), *gopo va gāvo gaṇayaṁ paresaṁ* (like a cowboy counting other people's cattle), *na bhāgavā sāmaññassa hoti* (does not partake of the ascetic life).

**Verse 20**: *Appam-pi ce sahitaṁ bhāsamāno* (even though reciting few scriptures), *Dhammassa hoti anudhammacārī* (one who lives righteously according to Dhamma), *rāgañ-ca dosañ-ca pahāya mohaṁ* (abandoning greed, hate, and delusion—THE THREE POISONS), *sammappajāno suvimuttacitto* (understanding rightly, with mind well-released), *anupādiyāno idha vā huraṁ vā* (not clinging here or hereafter), *sa bhāgavā sāmaññassa hoti* (THAT ONE partakes of the ascetic life).

The three poisons (rāga, dosa, moha) are THE core obstacles. This verse is Buddha's entire path in miniature: let go of these three, understand rightly, release the mind, stop clinging. That's it. That's the whole game.

## Suno Production Brief (Marcus "Groove" Washington)

**Musical Arrangement:**

At **92 BPM**, this stripped-down blues track opens with solo, finger-picked acoustic guitar—crisp, direct.

**Verses** remain sparse: guitar, soft brushed snare, light bass, and a commanding, conversational vocal.

**Chorus** gently layers in subtle organ and a second guitar for emphasis yet keeps the arrangement minimal.

**Bridge** brings in the full band with tighter drums and more present bass, growing in intensity but holding back.

For the **outro**, all drops away except guitar and voice, delivering an intimate, kitchen-table spoken passage.

---

**Emotional Arc:** Prophetic but not angry. Someone who's been through the game and knows the difference between talk and walk. Weathered wisdom, not judgment.

**Vocal Direction:** Conversational but authoritative. Not preaching AT people—testifying TO them. The spoken outro should feel like elder wisdom, gentle but firm.

## Clean Lyrics for Suno

```
[Verse 1]
You know every verse, every chapter, every line
Quote the scripture forwards, backwards, every time
But when it comes to living what you preach
Your hands are empty and your walk don't match your speech

[Chorus]
Talk is cheap, baby, where's your proof
You counting other people's cattle from the roof
Quoting wisdom but you ain't set free
Talk is cheap, show me what you BE

[Verse 2]
Maybe you don't know much, maybe just a few
But you living what you learned, walking what is true
Let go of greed, let go of hate
Let go of confusion, that's how you liberate

[Chorus]
Talk is cheap, honey, where's the change
You got all the answers but your life's the same
Quoting dharma but you still ain't free
Talk is cheap, show me what you BE

[Bridge]
The cowboy counting someone else's herd
Ain't got no cattle of his own, just words
But the one who tends what's right in front of him
That's the one who's living free within

Understanding right, mind released from chains
Not clinging here or there, breaking free from pain
That's the one who walks the path for real
Not just talking bout the dharma, living what they feel

[Verse 3]
So I'm checking my own walk before I check my talk
Am I living free or just going through the motions when I walk
Am I letting go or holding tight
Am I free inside or just quoting what sounds right

[Final Chorus]
Talk is cheap, and I know the score
It ain't about the words, it's what you're living for
Abandon greed and hate, walk in clarity
Talk is cheap, I'm gonna BE what's free

[Outro]
You can recite every teaching.
Know every verse by heart.
But if you're still clinging,
still caught in greed and hatred,
still confused,
you're just counting someone else's cattle.

The path isn't what you know.
It's what you've let go.

Talk is cheap.
Walk is everything.
```

## SoundCloud Description (Maya "Ink" Reynolds)

Talk Is Cheap
The William Altig Choir

📿 You know every verse, every chapter, every line. But when it comes to living what you preach, your walk don't match your speech.

The Buddha closed Chapter 1 of the Dhammapada with a reality check: you can quote all the scriptures in the world, but if you're not doing the work—if you're just counting other people's cattle instead of tending your own—you're missing the point.

The heedless person who recites abundant scriptures but doesn't practice is like a cowboy counting someone else's cattle. He doesn't partake of the path.

But the person who knows even just a few teachings yet LIVES them—abandoning greed, hate, and delusion, with right understanding and a well-released mind—THAT person walks the path for real.

Talk is cheap. Practice is everything.

This isn't about monks vs. laypeople or scholars vs. practitioners. This is about you and me checking our own walk before we check our talk. Am I living free or just going through the motions? Am I letting go or holding tight? Am I free inside or just quoting what sounds right?

The path isn't what you know. It's what you've let go.

🙏 Part of The Blues Dhammapada series—ancient wisdom, modern blues.

📿 Based on Dhammapada Verses 19-20 (Yamakavagga - The Twin Verses)

## Cover Art Brief (Deja "Vision" Williams)

### Song Essence
The divide between empty words and genuine practice—spiritual authenticity vs. spiritual performance.

### Visual Concept
Split image: On one side, a figure with mouth open, words/scripture floating out but feet in chains. On the other side, a figure with closed mouth, broken chains at their feet, walking forward into light. Same person, two choices.

**Alternative:** Hands holding an empty book vs. hands with dirt under the nails and broken chains—the difference between studying liberation and living it.

**Alternative 2:** A cowboy counting cattle that aren't his (shadowy, unfulfilled) vs. a farmer tending his own small garden (illuminated, free).

### Color Palette
- Warm earth tones (genuine practice, grounded reality)
- Cold grays/blues (empty performance, disconnection)
- Contrast between authenticity and pretense
- Warm amber light on the "walk" side

### Typography Direction
Bold, straight-talking font. No pretense, no decoration. The title "TALK IS CHEAP" should look like it's carved in wood or stamped in metal—solid, real, earned.

album cover, close-up of two pairs of hands, one holding pristine empty scripture book, other with dirt under nails and broken chain, contrast between empty knowledge and lived practice, warm amber and earth tones, blues album aesthetic, authentic spirituality
```

### Option C: Counting vs. Tending
```
album cover, cowboy silhouette counting shadowy cattle in distance vs illuminated farmer tending small garden close up, metaphor for empty knowledge vs genuine practice, blues aesthetic, warm earth tones, spiritual authenticity theme
