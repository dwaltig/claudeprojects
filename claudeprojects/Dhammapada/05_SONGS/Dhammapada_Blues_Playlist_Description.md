# Dhammapada Blues: Chapter 1 - The Twin Verses (Yamakavagga)

**The William Altig Choir**

Ancient Buddhist wisdom. American Blues soul.

2,500 years ago, the Buddha opened the Dhammapada with verses that show the power of contrasts: pure mind vs. corrupted mind, hatred vs. love, heedless vs. awake. This is Chapter 1—the Twin Verses (Yamakavagga)—translated into the language of the Mississippi Delta, the juke joint, the midnight hour.

Each song takes a teaching from the Dhammapada and lets it breathe through slow shuffles, gospel warmth, and weathered vocals. Not Buddhism explained—Buddhism *felt*.

## The Complete Album (9 Songs)

**Song 1: Mind Writes the First Verse** (Verses 1-2)
Your mind writes the first verse of your life's song. Everything else follows.

**Song 2: Put That Record Down** (Verses 3-4)
Stop replaying the old hurt. Lift the needle. Let the room go quiet.

**Song 3: We All Running Out of Time** (Verses 5-6)
Hate can't kill hate. And we're all dying here. So love while you can.

**Song 4: Stand Like a Mountain** (Verses 7-8)
Discipline makes you unmovable. Indulgence leaves you blown over like a weak tree.

**Song 5: Clothes Don't Make the Saint** (Verses 9-10)
The robe doesn't make you holy. Clean hands and a true heart do.

**Song 6: Fool's Gold** (Verses 11-12)
Chasing what looks valuable but isn't. Missing what's real for what shines.

**Song 7: Fix Your Roof** (Verses 13-14)
Passion seeps into an unprepared mind like rain through bad thatching.

**Song 8: Can You Sleep at Night** (Verses 15-16)
The evildoer mourns now and later. The righteous rejoices now and later.

**Song 9: The Fire Don't Quit** (Verses 17-18)
Evil burns you now and burns you more. Good lifts you now and lifts you higher.
