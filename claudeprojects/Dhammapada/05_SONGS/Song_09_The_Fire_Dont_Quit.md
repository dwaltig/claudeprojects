# The Fire Don't Quit

**Dhammapada Verses 17-18 | Blues Song by Sister Ray Johnson**

---

## The Teaching

Verses 17-18 take verses 15-16 and turn up the heat. This isn't just sorrow and joy anymore—this is *burning* and *bliss*. The teaching is about karmic compounding: your consequences don't stay the same, they GROW.

The evildoer doesn't just regret—they *burn*. The word *tappati* means to be scorched, tormented, consumed by inner fire. "I did that evil thing"—that thought alone starts the burning. And when the full consequences arrive? *Bhiyyo tappati*—"burns even more." The fire don't quit. It grows.

But the merit-maker? They *rejoice* (*nandati*). "I did that good thing"—that thought lifts them up right now. And when the good destinations unfold? *Bhiyyo nandati*—"rejoices even more." Joy compounds like interest in the bank.

This is the warning and the promise: whatever you're growing, it's gonna get bigger. Plant poison, harvest a bigger harvest of poison. Plant good, harvest a bigger harvest of good.

**Pali Source (key lines):**
- *"Idha tappati, pecca tappati, pāpakārī ubhayattha tappati, 'pāpaṁ me katan'ti tappati, bhiyyo tappati duggatiṁ gato."* — Here he burns, after death he burns, the evildoer burns in both places. "Evil has been done by me"—with this he burns, and burns even more having gone to a bad destination.
- *"Idha nandati, pecca nandati, katapuñño ubhayattha nandati, 'puññaṁ me katan'ti nandati, bhiyyo nandati suggatiṁ gato."* — Here he rejoices, after death he rejoices, the merit-maker rejoices in both places. "Good has been done by me"—with this he rejoices, and rejoices even more having gone to a good destination.

## The Song

### [Verse 1]
I knew a man who burned from the inside out
Couldn't escape the things that he'd done
Every quiet moment, that fire would start
"I did that evil"—and the burning had begun

He tried to run, tried to hide, tried to drink it away
But the flames just followed him down
And when the consequences finally came around
That fire burned him to the ground

### [Chorus]
The fire don't quit, no it just gets higher
What you plant today, tomorrow grows the fire
You can't outrun the heat of what you've done
The fire don't quit until you're overcome
But flip that script and plant the good
Watch the joy grow like it should
What you give out comes back twice
The fire don't quit—make sure it's the right fire

### [Verse 2]
I knew a woman who glowed from the inside out
Everything she touched turned to gold
Not 'cause of luck or magic or some cosmic deal
But 'cause her hands were clean and her heart was whole

She'd think about the good she'd done and smile
"I helped that stranger, I told the truth"
And when the blessings came back around to her
She had joy piled high to the roof

### [Chorus]
The fire don't quit, no it just gets higher
What you plant today, tomorrow grows the fire
You can't outrun the heat of what you've done
The fire don't quit until you're overcome
But flip that script and plant the good
Watch the joy grow like it should
What you give out comes back twice
The fire don't quit—make sure it's the right fire

### [Bridge]
Karma ain't punishment from the sky
It's the law of the harvest, the truth that don't lie
Burn now, burn later, burn even more
Or rejoice now, rejoice later, joy through every door
The seeds you're planting today
Are gonna grow either way
So choose what you're growing
'Cause the fire keeps on flowing

### [Verse 3]
So I'm checking my hands before I move
Checking my heart before I speak
'Cause I know that whatever fire I'm starting
Is the fire I'm gonna feel

If burning's what's coming, I'll change my ways
If joy's what I'm after, I know the path
Plant good seeds, think good thoughts
And let that joy compound and last

### [Final Chorus]
The fire don't quit, but I'm choosing my flame
What I plant today won't bring me shame
I can't outrun the seeds I've sown
But I can choose what fire I've grown
So I flip that script and plant the good
Watch the blessing grow like it should
What I give out comes back with love
The fire I'm burning lights me up

### [Outro - Spoken]
*You see, this ain't about scaring nobody.
It's just the truth—how it works.
Your actions compound.
Your consequences grow.
The question isn't whether there's gonna be a fire—
The question is: what kind of fire are you building?
A fire that burns you down?
Or a fire that lights your way?
The fire don't quit.
Make sure it's the right one.*

## Notes on the Blues

This song takes the "burning" (*tappati*) metaphor and runs with it. Fire is one of the most primal Blues images—the fire of passion, of rage, of hell, of purification. The double meaning works: you can burn with guilt or you can burn with purpose. The fire don't quit either way.

**Contemporary resonance:**
- Addiction and the escalating consequences
- The compound interest of good habits vs. bad habits
- Intergenerational trauma (burning passed down)
- The power of small daily choices to compound
- Guilt that grows over time vs. peace that deepens
- "What goes around comes around" made visceral

## Notes on the Dharma

**Verse 17** uses *tappati* (burns, is tormented) three times to show escalation. The phrase *"pāpaṁ me kataṁ"* ("evil has been done by me") is the internal burning—conscience, guilt, shame. Then *duggatiṁ gato* (having gone to a bad destination) brings *bhiyyo tappati* (burns even more)—external consequences intensifying the internal torment.

**Verse 18** mirrors this structure with *nandati* (rejoices). The internal joy of *"puññaṁ me kataṁ"* ("good has been done by me") leads to *suggatiṁ gato* (good destination) and *bhiyyo nandati* (rejoices even more).

The key insight is **compounding**: karma isn't static. Your consequences grow. This is why Buddhism emphasizes starting now, changing course now—because the longer you wait, the more the flames grow.

**Emotion:** Urgent warning that transforms into hopeful resolve. Start heavy, end triumphant.
**Tempo/Feel:** 85-92 BPM, driving blues-rock with gospel lift in the choruses. Think Tedeschi Trucks Band meets Mavis Staples.
**Palette:** Crunchy guitars, Hammond B3 organ swells, driving drums, bass that pushes forward. Build intensity through the song.
**Vocal:** Powerful, prophetic voice—someone delivering hard truth with love. Not angry, but URGENT. The spoken outro should feel like a sermon's closing moment.

## Clean Lyrics for Suno

```
[Verse 1]
I knew a man who burned from the inside out
Couldn't escape the things that he'd done
Every quiet moment, that fire would start
I did that evil and the burning had begun

He tried to run, tried to hide, tried to drink it away
But the flames just followed him down
And when the consequences finally came around
That fire burned him to the ground

[Chorus]
The fire don't quit, no it just gets higher
What you plant today, tomorrow grows the fire
You can't outrun the heat of what you've done
The fire don't quit until you're overcome
But flip that script and plant the good
Watch the joy grow like it should
What you give out comes back twice
The fire don't quit, make sure it's the right fire

[Verse 2]
I knew a woman who glowed from the inside out
Everything she touched turned to gold
Not cause of luck or magic or some cosmic deal
But cause her hands were clean and her heart was whole

She'd think about the good she'd done and smile
I helped that stranger, I told the truth
And when the blessings came back around to her
She had joy piled high to the roof

[Chorus]
The fire don't quit, no it just gets higher
What you plant today, tomorrow grows the fire
You can't outrun the heat of what you've done
The fire don't quit until you're overcome
But flip that script and plant the good
Watch the joy grow like it should
What you give out comes back twice
The fire don't quit, make sure it's the right fire

[Bridge]
Karma ain't punishment from the sky
It's the law of the harvest, the truth that don't lie
Burn now, burn later, burn even more
Or rejoice now, rejoice later, joy through every door
The seeds you're planting today
Are gonna grow either way
So choose what you're growing
Cause the fire keeps on flowing

[Verse 3]
So I'm checking my hands before I move
Checking my heart before I speak
Cause I know that whatever fire I'm starting
Is the fire I'm gonna feel

If burning's what's coming, I'll change my ways
If joy's what I'm after, I know the path
Plant good seeds, think good thoughts
And let that joy compound and last

[Final Chorus]
The fire don't quit, but I'm choosing my flame
What I plant today won't bring me shame
I can't outrun the seeds I've sown
But I can choose what fire I've grown
So I flip that script and plant the good
Watch the blessing grow like it should
What I give out comes back with love
The fire I'm burning lights me up

[Outro]
You see, this ain't about scaring nobody.
He was just telling you how it works.
Your actions compound.
Your consequences grow.
The question isn't whether there's gonna be a fire.
The question is, what kind of fire are you building?
A fire that burns you down?
Or a fire that lights your way?
The fire don't quit.
Make sure it's the right one.
```

## Cover Art Brief (Deja "Vision" Williams)

### Song Essence
The duality of fire—the same flames can destroy or illuminate. Karmic compounding visualized: consequences grow, whether burning or blessing.

### Visual Concept
A figure silhouetted against flames, but the flames transform: on one side, they're destructive red/orange (consuming, painful), on the other side they shift to warm gold/amber (illuminating, guiding). Two paths from one fire.

**Alternative:** A crossroads at night, one path leads into raging flames, the other into warm firelight from a welcoming home. Same fire energy, different destinations.

**Alternative 2:** Hands in flames—one pair burning, twisted in pain; another pair holding fire like a torch, powerful and purposeful.

### Color Palette
- Deep crimson and orange (destructive fire)
- Warm amber and gold (beneficial fire)
- Dark shadows and blacks (the unknown)
- Cool blue for contrast (peace, the alternative)

### Typography Direction
Bold, slightly weathered font—something that looks like it's been through fire but survived. The title should feel like a warning and a promise.

## Image Generation Prompts

### Option A: Transforming Flames
```
album cover, silhouette of person surrounded by flames, fire transforms from destructive red on left to warm golden light on right, two paths diverging, karma theme, dramatic contrast, blues album aesthetic, powerful and contemplative mood
```

### Option B: The Crossroads Fire
```
album cover, crossroads at night, one path leads into raging destructive flames, other path leads to warm welcoming firelight, choice between burning and blessing, deep shadows, blues aesthetic, karma and consequences theme
```

### Option C: Hands in Fire
```
album cover, dramatic close-up hands in flames, one pair burning painfully twisted, other pair holding fire as torch of power, duality theme, rich reds oranges golds, blues music aesthetic, karmic consequences
```

## SoundCloud Description (Maya "Ink" Reynolds)

**The Fire Don't Quit**
*The William Altig Choir*

🔥 **Karma Compounds**

Here's the truth: whatever fire you're building, it's gonna grow.

Do evil, and you burn now—"I did that terrible thing." That thought alone scorches you. Then when the consequences roll in? You burn even more. The fire don't quit.

Do good, and you rejoice now—"I helped, I told the truth." That thought lifts you up. And when the blessings come back around? You rejoice even more. The joy don't quit.

This isn't about heaven and hell up in the sky. This is about the fire you're building right now, today, in your own heart. Your consequences compound. Your seeds grow.

So the question isn't whether there's gonna be a fire. The question is: what kind of fire are you building?

🔥 Make sure it's the right one.
