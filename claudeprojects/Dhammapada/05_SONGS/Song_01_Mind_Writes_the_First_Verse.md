# Mind Writes the First Verse

**Dhammapada Verses 1-2 | Blues Song by Sister Ray Johnson**

---

## The Teaching

The Pali opening of the Dhammapada establishes the primacy of mind in shaping human experience. Verse 1: with a corrupted mind, suffering follows like the wheel follows the ox. Verse 2: with a pure mind, happiness follows like a shadow that never departs. This is karma as psychological causation—not cosmic punishment, but natural law.

**Pali Source:**
> Manopubbaṅgamā dhammā, manoseṭṭhā manomayā,
> manasā ce paduṭṭhena bhāsati vā karoti vā,
> tato naṁ dukkham-anveti cakkaṁ va vahato padaṁ.
>
> Manopubbaṅgamā dhammā, manoseṭṭhā manomayā,
> manasā ce pasannena bhāsati vā karoti vā,
> tato naṁ sukham-anveti chāyā va anapāyinī.

## The Song

### [Verse 1]
Woke up this morning with my troubles on my mind
Said I woke up this morning, troubles heavy on my mind
Been thinking hateful thoughts all night
Now I'm falling way behind

### [Chorus]
'Cause your mind writes the first verse
Your hands just play along
Yeah, your mind writes the first verse, baby
Your hands just play along
Better get your head right, honey
Or your whole life's a sad, sad song

### [Verse 2]
I was cursing at my enemies while laying in my bed
Reliving every wrong they done, playing movies in my head
Didn't raise my hand, didn't make a sound
But I poisoned myself instead

### [Chorus]
'Cause your mind writes the first verse
Your hands just play along
Yeah, your mind writes the first verse, baby
Your hands just play along
Better get your head right, honey
Or your whole life's a sad, sad song

### [Bridge]
The wheel follows the ox, the ox don't follow the wheel
What you're thinking 'fore you move is what you're gonna feel
Your shadow sticks to you from morning until night
So fill your mind with kindness if you want to walk in light

### [Verse 3]
Three in the morning, phone glowing in the dark
Replaying every failure, every miss, every mark
But I caught myself this time—I know how this thing goes
What I'm feeding in my head is what my tomorrow grows

### [Final Chorus]
So your mind writes the first verse
And the body sings the tune
Yeah, your mind writes the first verse, baby
Body just sings the tune
Better get your head right, honey
Or your whole life's a sad, sad song

### [Outro - spoken]
What are you thinking about tonight?
'Cause that's what tomorrow's made of.
Get your head right.
Everything else follows.

## Notes on the Blues

This speaks to the American experience of feeling trapped by circumstances—bills, relationships, systemic injustice—while the real trap is often mental. The "woke up this morning" opening is classic Blues testimony, immediately grounding ancient wisdom in everyday struggle.

**Contemporary resonance:**
- Doom-scrolling and negative news cycles poisoning the mind
- Rage culture and constant outrage online
- The epidemic of anxiety and depression
- Self-help culture's focus on "mindset" (which the Buddha addressed 2,500 years ago)

---

## Notes on the Dharma

- **Manopubbaṅgamā dhammā**: Mind precedes all phenomena—cognitive priority, not metaphysical idealism
- **Paduṭṭhena vs. pasannena**: Corrupted/polluted mind vs. pure/clear mind
- **Cakkaṁ va vahato padaṁ**: The wheel following the ox's foot—inexorable karmic causation
- **Chāyā va anapāyinī**: The shadow that never departs—natural persistence of wholesome mental states

## Suno Production Brief

**By Marcus "Groove" Washington**

### Lyric Analysis
- **Primary Emotion**: Weary wisdom—someone who's learned the hard way
- **Emotional Arc**: Trouble → Self-examination → Recognition → Resolve
- **Key Imagery**: Morning/waking, ox and wheel, shadows and light, poison and seeds
- **Energy Profile**: Low-to-medium, contemplative, unhurried

### Musical Recommendations

**Primary Sound Palette:**
Classic late-night Chicago electric blues. The vibe of a half-empty club at 1 AM. Warm, intimate, testimony-style. Think B.B. King's "The Thrill Is Gone" meets Bobby Blue Bland.

**Tempo & Feel:**
- 68-74 BPM, slow shuffle with deep pocket
- Brushed drums, snare soft on 2 and 4
- Space between phrases for guitar response

**Instrumentation:**
- Electric guitar: warm Gibson tone, slight overdrive, single-note lines
- Hammond B3 organ: pads and swells
- Upright or P-bass: walking quarter notes
- Brushed drums, minimal kit
- Optional: muted trumpet or tenor sax on bridge
- Optional: gospel choir on final chorus

**Vocal Direction:**
- Weathered voice—not young and smooth
- Conversational, testimony-style phrasing
- Spoken outro delivered intimately

## Clean Lyrics for Suno

```
[Verse 1]
Woke up this morning with my troubles on my mind
Said I woke up this morning, troubles heavy on my mind
Been thinking hateful thoughts all night
Now I'm falling way behind

[Chorus]
'Cause your mind writes the first verse
Your hands just play along
Yeah, your mind writes the first verse, baby
Your hands just play along
Better get your head right, honey
Or your whole life's a sad, sad song

[Verse 2]
I was cursing at my enemies while laying in my bed
Reliving every wrong they done, playing movies in my head
Didn't raise my hand, didn't make a sound
But I poisoned myself instead

[Chorus]
'Cause your mind writes the first verse
Your hands just play along
Yeah, your mind writes the first verse, baby
Your hands just play along
Better get your head right, honey
Or your whole life's a sad, sad song

[Bridge]
The wheel follows the ox, the ox don't follow the wheel
What you're thinking 'fore you move is what you're gonna feel
Your shadow sticks to you from morning until night
So fill your mind with kindness if you want to walk in light

[Verse 3]
Three in the morning, phone glowing in the dark
Replaying every failure, every miss, every mark
But I caught myself this time—I know how this thing goes
What I'm feeding in my head is what my tomorrow grows

[Chorus]
So your mind writes the first verse
And the body sings the tune
Yeah, your mind writes the first verse, baby
Body just sings the tune
Better get your head right, honey
Or your whole life's a sad, sad song

[Outro]
What are you thinking about tonight?
'Cause that's what tomorrow's made of.
Get your head right.
Everything else follows.

**Short Description:**
At 3 AM when your mind won't stop running, there comes a moment when you catch yourself. This song is about that moment. 🎵

**Full Description:**

Woke up this morning with my troubles on my mind...

The Buddha opened the Dhammapada with two verses that changed everything: your mind writes the first verse of your life. Everything else—your words, your actions, your whole story—just follows along.

Think hateful thoughts? Suffering follows you like a wheel behind the ox.
Think with clarity and kindness? Joy sticks to you like your shadow.

This isn't mystical—it's testable. What you feed your mind tonight is what tomorrow's made of.

"Get Your Head Right" is blues testimony meets ancient wisdom. For everyone doom-scrolling at 3 AM, replaying old hurts, or caught in the loop of anxiety. This song is your reminder: you can catch yourself. You can choose what to feed.

What are you thinking about tonight?
