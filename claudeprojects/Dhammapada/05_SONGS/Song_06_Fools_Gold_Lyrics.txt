[Verse 1]
Spent my whole life chasing diamonds made of glass
Thought I found the treasure but it never seemed to last
Gold watch on my wrist but my soul was running broke
All that shiny promise turned to ash and turned to smoke

[Chorus]
Fools gold, fools gold
Looks just like the real thing but it leaves you in the cold
Everybody selling what they swear is gonna shine
But the wise know the difference every single time
Fools gold, fools gold
What you chasing baby, is it worth your soul

[Verse 2]
They say get the corner office, get the house up on the hill
Get the followers and fame and then you'll finally get your fill
But I've seen rich folks crying in their marble halls at night
All that sapwood living when they needed heartwood right

[Chorus]
Fools gold, fools gold
Looks just like the real thing but it leaves you in the cold
Everybody selling what they swear is gonna shine
But the wise know the difference every single time
Fools gold, fools gold
What you chasing baby, is it worth your soul

[Bridge]
There's heartwood in the center and there's sapwood too
One's gonna last forever, one's gonna rot right through
You can spend your whole life feeding at the wrong trough
Or you can learn to tell the real from the payoff

[Verse 3]
Now I'm looking for the lasting things that money cannot buy
Peace that doesn't fade away and truth that doesn't lie
Freedom over pleasure, wisdom over noise
Character that's solid when the world takes all your toys

[Final Chorus]
Real gold, real gold
That's what I'm after now, worth more than I been told
Ain't no advertisement gonna fool me anymore
I know what I'm looking for, I know what life is for
Real gold, real gold
I finally know the difference, and I'm coming home whole

[Outro]
They got a whole world trying to sell you sapwood, friend.
Trying to tell you the shine is the substance.
But you can learn to see it, the difference between what glitters and what's gold.
Between what they're selling and what you actually need.
I had to learn this the hard way.
Maybe you don't have to.
