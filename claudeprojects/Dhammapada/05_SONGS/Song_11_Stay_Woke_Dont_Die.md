# Stay Woke, Don't Die

**Dhammapada Verses 21-22 | Blues Song by Sister Ray Johnson**

---

## The Teaching

Chapter 2 opens with the most radical statement in the Dhammapada: "Heedfulness is the deathless state, heedlessness the state of the dead" (*Appamādo amatapadaṁ, pamādo maccuno padaṁ*). 

This isn't metaphor—it's diagnostic truth. The heedless are already dead even while their hearts beat. They sleepwalk through life, distracted, numb, reactive. The heedful are ALIVE—awake to each moment, present, engaged. They don't die because they never stopped living.

Verse 22 doubles down: the wise understand this difference and *rejoice* in heedfulness. They delight in the path of the Noble Ones. This is Buddhism's counter to despair: wakefulness itself is joy.

## The Song

### [Verse 1]
I see people walking round like they already gone
Scrolling through their phones, but nobody's home
Eyes open, heart closed, moving but they're froze
Living on autopilot—man, that ain't no way to go

### [Chorus]
Stay woke, don't die
Heedfulness keeps you alive
Stay woke, don't die
The sleeping ones already died
You can breathe and have no pulse
Walk around and still be ghost
Stay woke, don't die
That's the only path that's real

### [Verse 2]
The wise ones know the difference and they choosing to be here
Present to the moment, even when it brings the fear
They ain't running, they ain't numbing, they ain't checking out the door
They delight in being conscious—that's what freedom's for

### [Chorus]
Stay woke, don't die
Heedfulness keeps you alive
Stay woke, don't die
The sleeping ones already died
You can breathe and have no pulse
Walk around and still be ghost
Stay woke, don't die
That's the only path that's real

### [Bridge]
Heedlessness is death, baby—you're a zombie on the street
Heedfulness is life, honey—feel your own heartbeat
The Noble Ones, they walking on the path that makes you whole
Stay awake, stay present, that's how you save your soul

### [Verse 3]
So I'm checking in this morning—am I here or am I gone?
Am I living or just existing, sleepwalking till the dawn?
I choose wakefulness, I choose presence, I choose being in this now
'Cause the deathless state is heedfulness—I'm taking that vow

### [Final Chorus]
I stay woke, don't die
Heedfulness keeps me alive
I stay woke, don't die
I ain't joining the walking dead
I can breathe and feel my pulse
I can walk and still have soul
Stay woke, don't die
That's the path the wise ones know

### [Outro - Spoken]
Heedfulness is the deathless state.
Heedlessness is the state of the dead.
The heedful do not die.
The heedless are already gone.
So wake up.
Stay woke.
Don't die while you're still breathing.

## Notes on the Blues

This song speaks directly to the 2025 American experience of disconnection, distraction, and numbness. The "walking dead" imagery resonates with:
- Doomscrolling and phone addiction
- Working jobs that kill the spirit
- Medicating pain instead of facing it
- Going through motions without presence
- Depression and dissociation epidemics

The hook "Stay woke, don't die" reclaims "woke" from political noise and returns it to its spiritual meaning: CONSCIOUSNESS. This is what the Blues has always taught—be present to the suffering AND the joy. Don't check out.

**Contemporary resonance:**
- The loneliness epidemic despite constant connection
- Mental health crisis and "deaths of despair"
- Automation and job alienation
- Climate grief and ecological anxiety
- Political exhaustion and checking out
- The collapse of meaning and purpose

## Notes on the Dharma

**Appamāda** (अप्पमाद) = heedfulness, vigilance, mindfulness, non-negligence. The opposite of sleepwalking through life. It's the cultivation of moment-to-moment awareness.

**Amatapadaṁ** (अमतपदं) = the deathless state, literally "the state of non-death." Not physical immortality but the deathless quality of awakened consciousness—beyond birth and death because fully present NOW.

**Pamādo maccuno padaṁ** = heedlessness is death's domain. The heedless are functionally dead—reactive, unconscious, driven by habit.

**Appamattā na mīyanti** = the heedful do not die. They're ALIVE now, which is the only life there is.

Verse 22 adds that the wise *rejoice* (pamodanti) in heedfulness and delight in the Noble Ones' domain. Wakefulness isn't grim duty—it's joy itself.

## Suno Production Brief (Marcus "Groove" Washington)

**Musical Arrangement:**

A blues-rock track at **98 BPM** opens with sharp, cutting electric guitar riffing over a hypnotic eighth-note bass pulse and a relentless, tightly locked drum groove.

**Verses** simmer with raw, urgent vocals and lean instrumentation.

**Chorus** swells with organ lifts and intensified guitar interplay.

**Energy** builds in the bridge—guitar and bass escalating together—before surging into a final, triumphant chorus.

**Outro** strips back to drums and bass as the vocalist delivers an impassioned spoken-word sermon, closing on a note of uplift.

---

**Emotional Arc:** Urgent wake-up call that builds to triumphant affirmation. Not preachy—prophetic. Someone pulling you back from the edge.

**Vocal Direction:** Powerful, direct, testifying. Not angry but URGENT. The spoken outro should land like a sermon.

## SoundCloud Description (Maya "Ink" Reynolds)

Stay Woke, Don't Die
The William Altig Choir

🔥 Heedfulness is the deathless state. Heedlessness is the state of the dead.

I see people walking around like they already gone—scrolling through their phones, but nobody's home. Eyes open, heart closed, moving but they're froze. Living on autopilot.

The Buddha opened Chapter 2 of the Dhammapada with the most radical diagnosis: the heedless are already dead even while their hearts beat. They sleepwalk through life, distracted, numb, reactive. The heedful are ALIVE—awake to each moment, present, engaged.

This isn't about meditation cushions or monasteries. This is about checking in this morning: Am I here or am I gone? Am I living or just existing, sleepwalking till the dawn?

The wise ones know the difference and they're choosing to be here. Present to the moment, even when it brings the fear. They delight in being conscious—that's what freedom's for.

Stay woke, don't die.

Heedfulness keeps you alive. The sleeping ones already died. You can breathe and have no pulse, walk around and still be ghost.

So wake up. Stay woke. Don't die while you're still breathing.

🙏 Part of The Blues Dhammapada series—ancient wisdom, modern blues.

📿 Based on Dhammapada Verses 21-22 (Appamādavagga - The Chapter on Heedfulness)

## Cover Art Brief (Deja "Vision" Williams)

### Song Essence
The stark divide between the walking dead and the truly alive—consciousness as the only real difference.

### Visual Concept
A figure standing at the edge, half in shadow, half in light. Behind them, shadowy silhouettes of people hunched over phones, sleepwalking. The awakened figure stands upright, facing golden light, eyes open, present. The visual asks: which side are you on?

**Alternative:** Single eye opening in darkness, iris reflecting warm light—the moment of waking up. Everything else black except that one eye blazing with consciousness.

**Alternative 2:** Crossroads at dawn—one path leads into foggy darkness with zombie-like figures, other path leads toward golden sunrise with a single alert figure walking toward light.

### Color Palette
- Deep indigo/midnight blue (unconsciousness, sleep, death)
- Warm amber/golden yellow (wakefulness, life, presence)
- Sharp contrast (no middle ground—you're awake or you're dead)
- Minimal palette for maximum impact

### Typography Direction
Bold, urgent font—something that shouts without being loud. Think vintage concert poster meets warning sign. Title at top in strong letters. The words "STAY WOKE" should hit like a wake-up call.
