# The Middle Road
## Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta | Blues Song by Sister Ray Johnson

## The Teaching

The Buddha's First Sermon, delivered at the Deer Park to five former companions. After years of extreme asceticism, the Buddha discovered that neither self-indulgence nor self-mortification leads to awakening. The Middle Way—balanced, steady, wise—is the path to liberation. This sermon introduced the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path.

**Pali Source (key lines):**
- *"Dveme, bhikkhave, antā pabbajitena na sevitabbā"* — These two extremes should not be followed by one who has gone forth.
- *"Majjhimā paṭipadā Tathāgatena abhisambuddhā"* — The Middle Path has been fully awakened to by the Tathāgata.
- *"Idaṃ dukkhaṃ ariyasaccaṃ"* — This is the noble truth of suffering.

## The Song

### [Verse 1]
I chased every pleasure, drank the bottle dry
Thought if I felt good enough the pain would finally die
Then I swung the other way, starved myself to bone
Whipped my body, cursed my flesh, sat on nails alone

### [Pre-Chorus]
Both roads led to nowhere, both fires burned me down
I was lost in the extremes 'til I heard a different sound

### [Chorus]
Walk the middle road, child, not too tight, not too loose
Walk the middle road, that's where you find the truth
Don't drown in your pleasures, don't beat yourself to death
Walk the middle road and catch your breath

### [Verse 2]
See right, think straight, speak kind, act clean
Work honest, try hard, pay attention to the scene
Train your mind to settle, let it rest in one good place
Eight steps on the highway, eight gates to grace

### [Chorus]
Walk the middle road, child, not too tight, not too loose
Walk the middle road, that's where you find the truth
Don't drown in your pleasures, don't beat yourself to death
Walk the middle road and catch your breath

### [Bridge]
The Blues is real—birth is hard, death is harder still
Getting sick, growing old, wanting what you never will
Where's it come from? That craving in your chest
That thirst that never quits, that hunger never blessed

But here's the good news, baby, the fire don't have to burn
The wheel can stop its spinning if you're willing to learn
Let the craving go and liberation comes
Walk the eight-step highway 'til the journey's done

### [Final Chorus]
Walk the middle road, child, not too tight, not too loose
Walk the middle road, that's where you find the truth
Don't chase every pleasure, don't punish your own soul
Walk the middle road—and you'll finally be whole

### [Outro - Spoken]
*Five brothers sat at the Deer Park that day.*
*One of them got it—right then, right there.*
*And the wheel of the Dharma started turning.*
*It's still turning, honey. It's turning for you.*
*Find your middle road.*

## Notes on the Blues

This song takes the Buddha's First Sermon—possibly the most important teaching in all of Buddhism—and makes it street-level practical. The hook "Walk the middle road" captures the essence: don't go to extremes. The Blues tradition knows this wisdom intuitively—it's the music of people who've been through too much to believe in quick fixes.

The bridge compresses the Four Noble Truths into eight lines. That's the challenge: making 2,500 years of philosophy feel like something you could hear in a roadhouse.

## Notes on the Dharma

**The Middle Way** (*majjhimā paṭipadā*) is the Buddha's first and most fundamental discovery. He'd tried luxury (as a prince) and asceticism (as a wanderer)—neither worked. The path between extremes leads to awakening.

**The Noble Eightfold Path** is distilled in Verse 2: Right View, Right Intention, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Mindfulness, Right Concentration.

**The Four Noble Truths** appear in the Bridge: suffering exists, craving causes it, it can end, and the path ends it.

## Clean Lyrics for Suno

```
[Verse 1]
I chased every pleasure, drank the bottle dry
Thought if I felt good enough the pain would finally die
Then I swung the other way, starved myself to bone
Whipped my body, cursed my flesh, sat on nails alone

[Pre-Chorus]
Both roads led to nowhere, both fires burned me down
I was lost in the extremes til I heard a different sound

[Chorus]
Walk the middle road, child, not too tight, not too loose
Walk the middle road, that's where you find the truth
Don't drown in your pleasures, don't beat yourself to death
Walk the middle road and catch your breath

[Verse 2]
See right, think straight, speak kind, act clean
Work honest, try hard, pay attention to the scene
Train your mind to settle, let it rest in one good place
Eight steps on the highway, eight gates to grace

[Chorus]
Walk the middle road, child, not too tight, not too loose
Walk the middle road, that's where you find the truth
Don't drown in your pleasures, don't beat yourself to death
Walk the middle road and catch your breath

[Bridge]
The Blues is real, birth is hard, death is harder still
Getting sick, growing old, wanting what you never will
Where's it come from? That craving in your chest
That thirst that never quits, that hunger never blessed

But here's the good news, baby, the fire don't have to burn
The wheel can stop its spinning if you're willing to learn
Let the craving go and liberation comes
Walk the eight-step highway til the journey's done

[Final Chorus]
Walk the middle road, child, not too tight, not too loose
Walk the middle road, that's where you find the truth
Don't chase every pleasure, don't punish your own soul
Walk the middle road and you'll finally be whole

[Outro]
Five brothers sat at the Deer Park that day
One of them got it, right then, right there
And the wheel of the Dharma started turning
It's still turning, honey. It's turning for you.
Find your middle road.

## SoundCloud Description

🎵 NEW SONG: "The Middle Road"

I chased every pleasure, drank the bottle dry. Then I swung the other way, starved myself to bone. Both roads led to nowhere.

The Buddha's First Sermon—the teaching that started everything—distilled into Blues.

After years of extremes, Siddhartha found the Middle Way: not too tight, not too loose. The path between the ditches. The road that leads to awakening.

This song contains:
• The Two Extremes (pleasure vs. self-denial)
• The Noble Eightfold Path (see right, think straight, speak kind...)
• The Four Noble Truths (compressed into the bridge)
• The moment Kondañña "got it" at the Deer Park

Walk the middle road, child. That's where you find the truth.

**Short Description:**
I chased every pleasure. Then I starved myself to bone. Both roads led to nowhere. Walk the middle road, child—that's where you find the truth. 🎵

**Full Description:**

The Buddha's First Sermon, translated into Blues.

After years of extreme living—first as a prince drowning in luxury, then as an ascetic nearly dying from self-denial—Siddhartha Gautama discovered the Middle Way. Neither extreme works. The path between the ditches is where awakening lives.

This song compresses the entire Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta—the Four Noble Truths, the Noble Eightfold Path—into a blues hymn for anyone who's been through too much and needs to find their balance.

Don't drown in your pleasures.
Don't beat yourself to death.
Walk the middle road and catch your breath.

NEW SONG 🎵

"The Middle Road" - The Buddha's First Sermon, Blues Edition

I chased every pleasure, drank the bottle dry. Thought if I felt good enough the pain would finally die. Then I swung the other way, starved myself to bone.

Both roads led to nowhere.

This is the teaching that started it all: The Middle Way. Not too tight, not too loose. The path between the extremes is where truth lives.

The Buddha shared this at the Deer Park 2,500 years ago. One man understood. And the wheel of the Dharma started turning.

It's still turning.
