# Can You Sleep At Night

**Dhammapada Verses 15-16 | Blues Song by Sister Ray Johnson**

---

## The Teaching

Verses 15-16 ask the oldest question there is: When you lay your head down at night—when you look back on your life—what do you see?

The wicked (*pāpakārī*) lament here in this life, and they lament after death too. Why? Because when they look at their deeds (*kamma*), they see the stain (*kiliṭṭha*). That stain doesn't wash out. It follows them. They suffer vexation (*vihaññati*)—that gnawing, grinding regret that won't let you rest.

But the righteous (*katapuñño*)? They rejoice here, and they rejoice after death. When they look at their deeds, they see purity (*visuddhi*). Not perfection—nobody's perfect—but clean hands and a clear conscience. They sleep at night. They die at peace.

This isn't about heaven and hell. It's about the feeling of looking at yourself and knowing what you've done. Can you live with that reflection? Can you die with it?

**Pali Source (key lines):**
- *"Idha socati, pecca socati, pāpakārī ubhayattha socati, so socati, so vihaññati, disvā kammakiliṭṭham-attano."* — Here he laments, after death he laments, the wicked one laments in both places, he laments, he suffers vexation, seeing the defilement of his own deeds.
- *"Idha modati, pecca modati, katapuñño ubhayattha modati, so modati, so pamodati, disvā kammavisuddhim-attano."* — Here he rejoices, after death he rejoices, the meritorious one rejoices in both places, he rejoices, he greatly rejoices, seeing the purity of his own deeds.

## The Song

### [Verse 1]
I've seen men with everything—the house, the car, the name
But they couldn't meet their own eyes in the mirror every day
Money in the bank but their soul account was overdrawn
Lying wide awake at 3 AM, waiting for the dawn

### [Chorus]
Can you sleep at night?
When the lights go down and you're alone
Can you sleep at night?
With the seeds you've sown
'Cause the things you do follow you through
Every breath you take, they're watching too
Can you sleep at night?
Tell me, can you sleep at night?

### [Verse 2]
I've seen folks with nothing but the shirt upon their back
Living in a way that don't leave nothing to regret
They look at how they've lived and there ain't no stain to see
Close their eyes in peace—that's how I want to be

### [Chorus]
Can you sleep at night?
When the lights go down and you're alone
Can you sleep at night?
With the seeds you've sown
'Cause the things you do follow you through
Every breath you take, they're watching too
Can you sleep at night?
Tell me, can you sleep at night?

### [Bridge]
Some folks lamenting here, gonna lament on the other side
Every dirty deed they did—can't run, can't hide
But the righteous ones rejoicing, both now and when they're gone
Looking at their life like a clear and honest song

### [Verse 3]
Now I'm cleaning up my act, putting right what I did wrong
Trying to live a life that I can look back on
When I meet my maker or just close my eyes for sleep
I want nothing on my conscience, nothing buried deep

### [Final Chorus]
I can sleep at night
When the lights go down and I'm alone
I can sleep at night
Reaping what I've sown
'Cause I'm living clean, nothing in between
Me and my reflection—if you know what I mean
I can sleep at night
Yeah, I can finally sleep at night

### [Outro - Spoken]
*You know, this ain't about scaring nobody with hellfire.
It's just the truth:
You're gonna have to look at yourself.
Here. Now. At the end.
So the question isn't what you can get away with.
The question is: What can you live with?
What can you die with?
Can you sleep at night?*

## Notes on the Blues

This song taps into the deepest Blues tradition—the reckoning. From Robert Johnson's crossroads to Johnny Cash singing to prisoners at Folsom, the Blues has always known that what you do comes back to you. Not as divine punishment, but as the inescapable weight of your own actions.

**Contemporary resonance:**
- White-collar crime and the sleepless nights of the guilty
- Addiction recovery and making amends
- The 3 AM anxiety of unresolved wrongs
- Deathbed regrets and hospice wisdom
- Cancel culture and the exposure of hidden deeds
- The peace of those who live with integrity
- The burden of secrets

The "can you sleep at night" question is universal. Everyone knows what it feels like to have something they can't forget.

## Notes on the Dharma

**Verse 15** uses *socati* (laments, grieves) three times to emphasize the compounding nature of regret. The wicked one laments HERE (*idha*) in this life and AFTER (*pecca*). The term *vihaññati* means to suffer vexation—that grinding, restless torment that won't let go.

**Verse 16** uses *modati* (rejoices) and *pamodati* (greatly rejoices) to show the opposite. The meritorious one (*katapuñño*—literally "one who has made merit") sees the purity (*visuddhi*) of their own deeds and is at peace.

This isn't external reward or punishment. It's the natural consequence of what you DO reflecting back to you. Your actions become the mirror you can't look away from.

## Suno Production Brief (Marcus "Groove" Washington)

**Emotion:** Intimate confrontation, late-night reckoning, the quiet moment when all the noise stops and you're left with yourself.
**Tempo/Feel:** 65-70 BPM, slow burn midnight confession. Space between the beats. This is 3 AM music.
**Palette:** Sparse, intimate blues. Electric guitar with reverb and sustain (lonely notes, not busy), bass walking slow, brushes on drums or minimal percussion. Maybe a distant organ. Think live-in-the-studio feel.
**Vocal:** Deep, confessional male or female voice. Someone who's been there. Think Etta James at her most vulnerable, or Chris Stapleton in his quiet moments. No showboating—just truth.

## Clean Lyrics for Suno

```
[Verse 1]
I've seen men with everything, the house, the car, the name
But they couldn't meet their own eyes in the mirror every day
Money in the bank but their soul account was overdrawn
Lying wide awake at 3 AM, waiting for the dawn

[Chorus]
Can you sleep at night
When the lights go down and you're alone
Can you sleep at night
With the seeds you've sown
'Cause the things you do follow you through
Every breath you take, they're watching too
Can you sleep at night
Tell me, can you sleep at night

[Verse 2]
I've seen folks with nothing but the shirt upon their back
Living in a way that don't leave nothing to regret
They look at how they've lived and there ain't no stain to see
Close their eyes in peace, that's how I want to be

[Chorus]
Can you sleep at night
When the lights go down and you're alone
Can you sleep at night
With the seeds you've sown
'Cause the things you do follow you through
Every breath you take, they're watching too
Can you sleep at night
Tell me, can you sleep at night

[Bridge]
Some folks lamenting here, gonna lament on the other side
Every dirty deed they did, can't run, can't hide
But the righteous ones rejoicing, both now and when they're gone
Looking at their life like a clear and honest song

[Verse 3]
Now I'm cleaning up my act, putting right what I did wrong
Trying to live a life that I can look back on
When I meet my maker or just close my eyes for sleep
I want nothing on my conscience, nothing buried deep

[Final Chorus]
I can sleep at night
When the lights go down and I'm alone
I can sleep at night
Reaping what I've sown
'Cause I'm living clean, nothing in between
Me and my reflection, if you know what I mean
I can sleep at night
Yeah, I can finally sleep at night

[Outro]
You know, this ain't about scaring nobody with hellfire.
It's just the truth.
You're gonna have to look at yourself.
Here. Now. At the end.
So the question isn't what you can get away with.
The question is, What can you live with?
What can you die with?
Can you sleep at night?
```

## Cover Art Brief (Deja "Vision" Williams)

### Song Essence
The quiet, inescapable confrontation with yourself—3 AM, alone, nowhere to hide from what you've done.

### Visual Concept
A figure sitting on the edge of a bed in darkness, only their silhouette visible against a window showing moonlight or city lights. The posture could be contemplative OR peaceful—ambiguous enough to represent both the lamenter and the one at peace.

**Alternative:** A mirror in a dark room, showing a reflection. The viewer is invited to see themselves. Simple, stark, confrontational.

**Alternative 2:** Two beds side by side—one figure sleeping peacefully (soft light), the other awake, restless (harsh shadows). Same night, different lives.

### Color Palette
- Deep midnight blue (3 AM sky)
- Moonlight silver (cold truth)
- Warm amber (peace, acceptance)
- Deep shadows (what's hidden)
- Stark whites (nowhere to hide)

### Typography Direction
Clean, slightly worn serif font—something that looks like it's been through some nights. Understated. The title should feel like a whispered question, not a shout.

## SoundCloud Description (Maya "Ink" Reynolds)

**Can You Sleep At Night**
*The William Altig Choir*

🎵 **Midnight Confession**

When the lights go down and you're alone—what do you see?

The Buddha said the wicked lament here AND after. Why? Because when they look at their own deeds, they see the stain. That stain doesn't wash out. It follows them. 3 AM, wide awake, waiting for a dawn that doesn't bring peace.

But the righteous? They rejoice in both worlds. Not because they're rewarded—because when they look at their life, they see no stain. They close their eyes in peace. They sleep at night.

This isn't about heaven and hell. This is about the mirror you can't look away from.

Can you sleep at night?

## Facebook Post (Marcus "Echo" Thompson)

When the lights go down and you're alone—can you sleep at night?

I've seen men with everything—the house, the car, the name—who couldn't meet their own eyes in the mirror. Money in the bank, soul account overdrawn. Wide awake at 3 AM, waiting for a dawn that never brings peace.

And I've seen folks with nothing but the shirt on their back who close their eyes in peace every night. No stain to see. Nothing buried deep.

The Buddha said the wicked lament here AND after death. Not because God punishes them—because they have to LOOK at what they've done. That reflection follows you everywhere.

The righteous? They rejoice in both worlds. When they look at their life, they see no stain.

This isn't about heaven and hell. It's about the mirror.

What do you see when you look at your deeds? Can you live with it? Can you die with it?

Can you sleep at night? 🌙

**Caption:**

Can you sleep at night? 🌙

I've seen men with everything—
house, car, name—
who couldn't meet their own eyes
in the mirror.

Money in the bank,
soul account overdrawn.
Wide awake at 3 AM,
waiting for the dawn.

And I've seen folks with nothing
who close their eyes in peace.
No stain to see.
Nothing buried deep.

The question isn't
what you can get away with.
The question is:
What can you live with?
What can you die with?
