# We All Running Out of Time

**Dhammapada Verses 5-6 | Blues Song by Sister Ray Johnson**

---

## The Teaching

Verse 5 delivers the eternal law: hatred never ceases through hatred—only through non-hatred does it end. Verse 6 deepens this with memento mori: "Most don't understand that we are perishing here." When you truly realize everyone's time is running out, the petty fights lose their grip. Why waste your dying breath on hate?

**Pali Source (key lines):**
- *"Na hi verena verāni sammantīdha kudācanaṁ, averena ca sammanti—esa dhammo sanantano."* — Hatred never ends by hatred; only by non-hatred does it end. This is the eternal law.
- *"Pare ca na vijānanti mayam-ettha yamāmase."* — Others do not understand that here, we are perishing.

## The Song

### [Verse 1]
I used to carry grudges like a second set of keys
Kept 'em in my pocket, polished them with memories
Every name that wronged me, every hand that did me dirty
Had a file in my heart that I updated past thirty

### [Chorus]
But we all running out of time
Every tick of the clock is yours and mine
Why you gonna waste it holding on to hate?
We all running out of time—don't let it be too late

### [Verse 2]
Fire don't put out fire, that's the oldest law there is
My grandmama told me that, and her grandmother told her kids
You want the burning to stop? You gotta bring something different
Non-hate for the hatred—that's the healing, that's the treatment

### [Chorus]
We all running out of time
Every tick of the clock is yours and mine
Why you gonna waste it holding on to hate?
We all running out of time—don't let it be too late

### [Bridge]
Look around this room, every soul is headed home
Could be tomorrow, could be tonight, nobody knows
So what you fighting for? What grudge is worth your breath?
Let it go, let it go—we're all just walking toward death

### [Verse 3]
Wise ones figured this out, they don't bother with the brawl
When you know the clock is ticking, you stop sweating the small
Put your sword down, brother, sister, lay your burdens on the ground
This old world's too beautiful to miss while you're angry at the sound

### [Final Chorus]
We all running out of time
Every tick of the clock is yours and mine
Don't you wanna feel that peace before you go?
We all running out of time—let the hatred flow

### [Outro - Spoken]
*Here's my loving trick for you tonight:
Stop fighting fire with fire—it only burns the house down.
Meet hate with something softer, something wiser.
Your time is precious, baby. Don't waste it being angry.
We running out of time... so love while you can.*

## Notes on the Blues

This song addresses America's current moment of division—political, social, generational. Everyone's carrying their grudges like trophies. But the Buddha's teaching cuts through: we're all dying. The argument with your brother, the rage at strangers online, the old wound you keep picking at—none of it survives your last breath.

The hook "We all running out of time" universalizes the message. Nobody escapes death. That shared fate is either terrifying or liberating. The song chooses liberation.

## Notes on the Dharma

**Verse 5** contains *esa dhammo sanantano*—"this is the eternal law." The Buddha's claiming universal truth: hatred perpetuates itself; only non-hatred breaks the cycle. This isn't passive acceptance of harm—it's refusing to poison yourself with resentment.

**Verse 6** introduces *yamāmase*—"we are perishing." Most translations soften this. The Pali is stark: we're actively dying, right now. The wise (*vijānanti*) understand this and stop quarreling (*medhagā*). Death awareness as the great peacemaker.

**Palette:** Acoustic guitar foundation (resonator or National steel), subtle organ swells, brushed drums building to a fuller kit on final chorus, gospel choir on the final chorus lift, upright bass walking but not busy.

## Clean Lyrics for Suno

```
[Verse 1]
I used to carry grudges like a second set of keys
Kept 'em in my pocket, polished them with memories
Every name that wronged me, every hand that did me dirty
Had a file in my heart that I updated past thirty

[Chorus]
But we all running out of time
Every tick of the clock is yours and mine
Why you gonna waste it holding on to hate?
We all running out of time, don't let it be too late

[Verse 2]
Fire don't put out fire, that's the oldest law there is
My grandmama told me that, and her grandmother told her kids
You want the burning to stop? You gotta bring something different
Non-hate for the hatred, that's the healing, that's the treatment

[Chorus]
We all running out of time
Every tick of the clock is yours and mine
Why you gonna waste it holding on to hate?
We all running out of time, don't let it be too late

[Bridge]
Look around this room, every soul is headed home
Could be tomorrow, could be tonight, nobody knows
So what you fighting for? What grudge is worth your breath?
Let it go, let it go, we're all just walking toward death

[Verse 3]
Wise ones figured this out, they don't bother with the brawl
When you know the clock is ticking, you stop sweating the small
Put your sword down, brother, sister, lay your burdens on the ground
This old world's too beautiful to miss while you're angry at the sound

[Final Chorus]
We all running out of time
Every tick of the clock is yours and mine
Don't you wanna feel that peace before you go?
We all running out of time, let the hatred flow

[Outro]
Here's my loving trick for you tonight
Stop fighting fire with fire, it only burns the house down
Meet hate with something softer, something wiser
Your time is precious, baby. Don't waste it being angry.
We running out of time, so love while you can

## YouTube Music Video Description (Marcus "Echo" Thompson)

**Short Description:**
Fire don't put out fire. That's the oldest law there is. We all running out of time—don't waste yours on hate. 🎵

**Full Description:**

I used to carry grudges like a second set of keys...

The Buddha taught two truths that changed everything:

First: Hatred never ceases through hatred. You can't put out fire with fire. Only non-hatred—only letting go—ends the burning.

Second: Most people don't understand that we are perishing. Right now. Every one of us, walking toward the same door.

When you really get that—when you feel it in your bones—the petty fights lose their grip. The old grudges feel foolish. Why waste your dying breath on hate?

This song is for everyone carrying anger they're too tired to set down. For the family feuds, the political rage, the old wounds we keep picking at.

Your time is precious. Don't waste it being angry.
