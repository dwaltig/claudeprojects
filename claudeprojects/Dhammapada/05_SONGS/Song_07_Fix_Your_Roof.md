# Fix Your Roof

**Dhammapada Verses 13-14 | Blues Song by Sister Ray Johnson**

---

## The Teaching

Verses 13-14 hit you with the most practical metaphor the Buddha ever dropped: Your mind is a house. And if your roof's got holes in it, every rainstorm's gonna soak you to the bone.

The rain? That's passion—craving, anger, lust, fear, all the storms that life throws at you. And they're GOING to come. That's not the question. The question is: What kind of roof you got?

An undeveloped mind (*abhāvitaṁ cittaṁ*) is like a house with bad thatch. Every breeze, every drizzle, every hurricane—it all gets in. You're flooded before you even know what hit you.

But a well-developed mind (*subhāvitaṁ cittaṁ*)? That's a tight roof. Storm can rage all night, you stay dry inside. The rain still falls—but it doesn't penetrate.

This isn't about avoiding storms. It's about building a shelter that can take them.

**Pali Source (key lines):**
- *"Yathā agāraṁ ducchannaṁ vuṭṭhī samativijjhati, evaṁ abhāvitaṁ cittaṁ rāgo samativijjhati."* — Just as rain penetrates a house with poor thatching, so passion penetrates an undeveloped mind.
- *"Yathā agāraṁ succhannaṁ vuṭṭhī na samativijjhati, evaṁ subhāvitaṁ cittaṁ rāgo na samativijjhati."* — Just as rain does not penetrate a house with good thatching, so passion cannot penetrate a well-developed mind.

## The Song

### [Verse 1]
Every time it rained, my whole world got soaked
Water in the kitchen, ceiling tiles all broke
Landlord wouldn't fix it, said "That's just how it goes"
But the problem wasn't weather—it was holes I didn't close

### [Chorus]
Fix your roof before the storm comes
Fix your roof while the sun is out
'Cause when that rain starts falling, baby
You'll find out what you're really about
Fix your roof, fix your roof
Build it tight, make it strong, make it proof

### [Verse 2]
Had a woman leave me, thought I'd drown in my pain
Anger, jealousy, and craving pouring down like acid rain
But my neighbor lost his wife too—he stood there in the flood
Eyes clear, heart open, planted flowers in the mud

### [Chorus]
Fix your roof before the storm comes
Fix your roof while the sun is out
'Cause when that rain starts falling, baby
You'll find out what you're really about
Fix your roof, fix your roof
Build it tight, make it strong, make it proof

### [Bridge]
The storm ain't the problem—storms are gonna come
The question is your shelter when the sky goes numb
Some folks standing in the flood wondering why they're wet
While the wise ones did the work so they got no regret

### [Verse 3]
Now I'm up at dawn with my practice every day
Patching up the places where the weakness wants to stay
Meditation's my hammer, wisdom is my nail
Building something solid that won't fail

### [Final Chorus]
Fix your roof before the storm comes
Fix your roof, you got time right now
'Cause when that rain starts falling, baby
You'll know exactly how
To stay dry, stay dry inside
Let the storm rage—you got nothing to hide

### [Outro - Spoken]
*See, this ain't about stopping the rain.
Rain's gonna fall—that's just life.
It's about doing the work now.
Build your mind like you'd build a house you plan to live in forever.
'Cause the storms? They're already on their way.*

## Notes on the Blues

This song channels the deep American anxiety of housing insecurity—the fear of the roof caving in, literally and metaphorically. From the Blues tradition of "Trouble in Mind" to contemporary precarity, we know what it feels like to be one bad week away from disaster.

**Contemporary resonance:**
- Housing crisis and the working poor
- Mental health and emotional flooding
- The difference between those who crumble in crisis and those who stay grounded
- Therapy, meditation, and spiritual practice as preventive maintenance
- Climate anxiety—literal storms getting worse
- Being unprepared for life's inevitable shocks

The Blues has always been sung by people who KNOW what a leaky roof feels like. This song honors that while pointing toward the inner work that makes the difference.

## Notes on the Dharma

**Verse 13** introduces *rāga* (passion, craving, attachment) as the rain that soaks us. This isn't just sexual passion—it's all forms of grasping that flood the unguarded mind. The term *abhāvitaṁ* (undeveloped, uncultivated) points to the Buddhist insight that mind-training is not optional—it's construction work.

**Verse 14** offers the counter-image: *subhāvitaṁ* (well-developed, well-cultivated). This is the bhāvanā tradition—meditation and mental cultivation—that literally means "causing to become." You MAKE your mind weather-proof through practice.

The metaphor is brilliantly practical: You don't control the weather. You DO control the roof.

## Suno Production Brief (Marcus "Groove" Washington)

**Emotion:** Practical urgency mixed with hard-won wisdom. Someone who's BEEN flooded and finally figured out the fix.
**Tempo/Feel:** 85-90 BPM, driving but not frantic. A work-song groove—like hammer on nails. This is about DOING something.
**Palette:** Modern blues-rock with soul foundations. Driving electric guitar (think Gary Clark Jr at his most determined), solid bass locking with drums, maybe some organ swells on the chorus to give it lift.
**Vocal:** Strong, determined male or female vocal. Not lamenting—WORKING. Think Susan Tedeschi or Christone "Kingfish" Ingram. Someone with grit and purpose.

## Cover Art Brief (Deja "Vision" Williams)

### Song Essence
The visual tension between vulnerability and preparation—a house in the storm, but one that's been made ready. The work of protection.

### Visual Concept
A small house or cabin under a dramatic stormy sky—rain falling all around. But the house itself glows warm inside, roof solid, light in the windows. A figure could be visible through the window, calm and dry while the world rages outside.

**Alternative:** Close-up of hands patching a roof—hammer and nails, honest labor. Storm clouds gathering in the background, but the work is being done NOW.

**Alternative 2:** Split composition: On one side, a house with holes in the roof, rain pouring through, everything inside ruined. On the other side, a house with tight thatch, rain beading off, warm light inside.

### Color Palette
- Storm gray and blue (threatening sky)
- Warm amber and gold (interior light, safety)
- Deep brown (solid wood, honest construction)
- Rain silver (the falling element)
- Dark shadows (contrast, drama)

### Typography Direction
Bold, solid serif—something that looks BUILT. The title should feel like a command, urgent but not panicked. Construction-site energy.

## SoundCloud Description (Maya "Ink" Reynolds)

**Fix Your Roof**
*The William Altig Choir*

🎵 **Blues Work Song**

The storm ain't the problem. Storms are gonna come.

The question is: What kind of roof you got?

The Buddha dropped this metaphor 2,500 years ago, and it hits just as hard today. Your mind is a house. An undeveloped mind is like bad thatch—every rainstorm floods you. But a well-cultivated mind? Tight roof. The rain still falls, but you stay dry inside.

This isn't about avoiding life's storms. It's about doing the work NOW—while the sun is out—so when the rain comes (and it WILL come), you're ready.

Do the work. Fix your roof.

The storm ain't the problem. Storms are gonna come.

The question is: What kind of roof you got?

I've watched two people go through the exact same loss. One was flooded—anger, craving, jealousy pouring through every crack. The other stood there with clear eyes and an open heart. Planted flowers in the mud.

Same storm. Different roofs.

The Buddha said your mind is like a house. If the roof's got holes, every rain soaks you to the bone. But if you've done the work—meditation, practice, honest labor on yourself—you stay dry inside while the whole sky falls.

This song is a work song. A reminder that the time to fix your roof is NOW, while the sun is out. Because the storms? They're already on their way.

What are you doing to weatherproof your mind? 🛠️

**Short Description:**
The storm ain't the problem—storms are gonna come. The question is: What kind of roof you got? 🏠⛈️🎵

**Full Description:**

Fix your roof before the storm comes...

The Buddha dropped this metaphor to explain why some people crumble in crisis while others stay grounded. Your mind is a house. If you haven't done the work to make it solid—meditation, practice, honest inner labor—every storm floods you.

But if your roof is tight? The rain still falls. You stay dry inside.

This isn't about avoiding storms. Life brings storms. This is about doing the work NOW:
- While the sun is out
- Before crisis hits
- When you have the luxury of time

Because the storms are already on their way.
