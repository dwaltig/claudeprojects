# Artist Statements: "Mind Writes the First Verse"

**Dhammapada Verses 1-2 | What We Hope to Accomplish**

## 🎤 Sister Ray Johnson — The Songwriter

*She leans back, coffee cup in hand, dawn light coming through the kitchen window*

What do I hope to accomplish with this song? Baby, let me tell you what keeps me up at night.

Right now in America, we got people drowning in their own heads. They're doom-scrolling at 2 AM, replaying arguments from ten years ago, rehearsing conversations that ain't never gonna happen, waking up exhausted because their mind ran a marathon all night while their body lay still.

We got a whole generation raised on the idea that they're victims of their circumstances—and look, circumstances ARE real, injustice IS real, I ain't denying that. But somewhere we lost the teaching that says: **what you do with your mind in response to those circumstances—THAT'S where your power lives.**

The Buddha knew this 2,500 years ago. My grandmother knew it singing in the Baptist church. Every Blues singer who found freedom instead of bitterness knew it.

**"Mind writes the first verse."**

I want that hook stuck in somebody's head the next time they're spiraling at 3 AM. I want them humming it while they're catastrophizing about work, about money, about their ex. I want them to catch themselves mid-poison-thought and hear: *"Better get your head right, honey, or your whole life's a sad, sad song."*

This song ain't therapy. It ain't telling nobody everything's fine. It's saying: **you've got one piece of this that's actually in your control, and it's the most important piece.** Start there.

If one person listens to this and stops the mental loop for ten seconds? Job done. If one person wakes up tomorrow and catches themselves before they start the day with poison thinking? That's Dharma transmission through the radio.

That's what I hope to accomplish.

## 🎛️ Marcus "Groove" Washington — The Producer

*He swivels in his studio chair, the board glowing softly behind him*

Ray's got the message. My job? Make sure it LANDS.

Here's the thing about music—it bypasses the parts of the brain that argue. You can debate a philosophy. You can reject a sermon. But a groove? A hook? That gets in through a door the thinking mind can't guard.

I want this song to sound like **coming home at 3 AM after a long shift**, sinking into your chair, finally being honest with yourself. That's why I pushed for the slow shuffle, the B.B. King tone—warm, not aggressive. This ain't a lecture. It's a conversation with yourself.

### What I Hope to Accomplish:

1. **Accessibility.** The production has to be welcoming—not too churchy for the secular folks, not too bluesy for the spiritual seekers. That "late-night club" vibe is neutral ground where anyone can sit down.

2. **The hook has to stick.** "Mind writes the first verse" needs to be what you're humming in the shower three days later. That's where the Dharma transmission actually happens—not when you're listening, but when you're NOT listening and it's still playing in your head.

3. **Emotional permission.** The sound has to give people permission to feel what they're feeling. The weariness in the vocal, the patience in the groove—it says "I've been there too." That's what makes space for transformation.

4. **Authenticity.** This has to sound like Blues, not like someone appropriating Blues. That means real chord changes, real guitar language, real feel. The Dharma's been in Blues since the beginning—we're just making it explicit.

Honestly? If someone hears this track on a late-night playlist and something shifts for them—even just a moment of recognition, a moment of "wait, maybe I CAN choose what I think about"—that's the win.

The Buddha taught in whatever language his listeners spoke. We're just updating the language. The truth is the same.

*He turns back to the board.*

Now let's make sure the mix serves that truth.

## The Shared Vision

Both artists want the same thing: **ancient wisdom delivered in a form that slips past modern defenses and actually changes how someone moves through their day.**

- Sister Ray provides the message and the hook
- Marcus provides the vessel that carries it home

Together: Dharma transmission through the radio.
