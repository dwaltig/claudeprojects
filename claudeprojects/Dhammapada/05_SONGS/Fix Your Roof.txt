Every time it rained, my whole world got soaked
Water in the kitchen, ceiling tiles all broke
Landlord wouldn't fix it, said that's just how it goes
But the problem wasn't weather, it was holes I didn't close

Fix your roof before the storm comes
Fix your roof while the sun is out
'Cause when that rain starts falling baby
You'll find out what you're really about
Fix your roof, fix your roof
Build it tight, make it strong, make it proof

Had a woman leave me, thought I'd drown in my pain
Anger, jealousy and craving pouring down like acid rain
But my neighbor lost his wife too, he stood there in the flood
Eyes clear, heart open, planted flowers in the mud

Fix your roof before the storm comes
Fix your roof while the sun is out
'Cause when that rain starts falling baby
You'll find out what you're really about
Fix your roof, fix your roof
Build it tight, make it strong, make it proof

The storm ain't the problem, storms are gonna come
The question is your shelter when the sky goes numb
Some folks standing in the flood wondering why they're wet
While the wise ones did the work so they got no regret

Now I'm up at dawn with my practice every day
Patching up the places where the weakness wants to stay
Meditation's my hammer, wisdom is my nail
Building something solid that won't fail

Fix your roof before the storm comes
Fix your roof, you got time right now
'Cause when that rain starts falling baby
You'll know exactly how
To stay dry, stay dry inside
Let the storm rage, you got nothing to hide

See, this ain't about stopping the rain.
Rain's gonna fall, that's just life.
It's about doing the work now.
Build your mind like you'd build a house you plan to live in forever.
'Cause the storms? They're already on their way.
