I knew a man who chased every shiny thing in sight
Pretty faces, fast money, parties every night
Eyes wide open but he couldn't see the cliff
Living for the high with no strength to lift
You gotta stand like a mountain, baby
When that wind starts to blow
You gotta stand like a mountain
Let the storm rage, let it go
Some folks fall like weak trees
Māra takes them down low
But if you built it right, you built it deep
You stand like a mountain in the snow
Screens glow blue, feeds telling you what you need
Every dopamine hit is planting poison seed
No restraint on the appetite, no limit on the scroll
All that pretty empty filling up a hungry hole
You gotta stand like a mountain, baby
When that wind starts to blow
You gotta stand like a mountain
Let the storm rage, let it go
Some folks fall like weak trees
Māra takes them down low
But if you built it right, you built it deep
You stand like a mountain in the snow
Train your eyes to see beneath the surface shine
Know when enough's enough, that wisdom's worth more than wine
Put in the work when nobody's watching you
Build your roots down deep, and no storm's getting through
Every morning I get up, I do the hardest thing
Face the truth about myself before I hear the bells ring
Keep my senses on a leash, know my limits well
Building strength for when the tempests come, and oh, they will
So I stand like a mountain, baby
When that wind starts to blow
I stand like a mountain
Let the storm rage, let it go
Weak trees falling all around me
Māra trying to take me down below
But I built it right, I built it deep
I stand like a mountain in the snow
You can't control the storm, but you can control what you're made of
Build your roots deep. Train yourself strong.
When Māra comes, and she always comes
you'll be standing while the weak trees fall
