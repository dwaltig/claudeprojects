# Chapter 6: Paṇḍitavagga - Blues Edition
## The Wise: Standing Like Rock, Deep Like a Lake

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

If Chapter 5 held up a mirror showing the fool, this chapter shows who you COULD be. The wise one. Not born wise—MADE wise through practice. Stands like rock when the wind blows. Calm like a deep lake. Sees criticism as treasure. Crosses to the other shore while everybody else runs along the bank.

### Verses 76-78: Choose Your People

**Verse 76**

**The Blues Truth:**

Someone shows you your faults?  
That's somebody showing you treasure.  
Someone shows you your faults?  
That's gold you couldn't find yourself.

Keep company, keep company  
With the one who reproves you.  
Better for you, not worse—  
That's what the wise one knew.

**Verse 77**

**The Blues Truth:**

Advise and instruct,  
Forbid what's wrong—  
The good will love you for it,  
The bad won't play along.

Good folks love correction.  
Bad folks hate it cold.  
That tells you something about people,  
And what kind of truth they'll hold.

**Verse 78**

**The Blues Truth:**

Don't walk with wicked friends,  
Don't walk with wicked friends.  
Don't keep company with the low ones—  
That's where your trouble begins.

Walk with spiritual friends,  
Walk with spiritual friends.  
Keep company with the noble—  
That's how your wisdom extends.

**Blues Notes:** *Kalyāṇamitta* (spiritual friend) is a technical Buddhist term. The Buddha said spiritual friendship is "the whole of the holy life." The fourfold structure (don't...don't...do...do) creates memorable rhythm for a crucial teaching.

### Verses 79-80: Drink Dhamma, Master Yourself

**Verse 79**

**The Blues Truth:**

Drink the Dhamma, drink the Dhamma,  
Live well with a clear mind.  
Drink the Dhamma, drink the Dhamma,  
Delight in what the Noble Ones designed.

Not just reading, not just hearing—  
Drinking down into your soul.  
The wise one drinks the teachings,  
And that Dhamma makes them whole.

**Verse 80**

**The Blues Truth:**

Course-makers lead the water.  
Fletchers straighten arrows.  
Carpenters straighten wood.  
The wise master themselves.

Water, arrow, wood—  
Each gets shaped by a hand.  
But YOU shape your own self,  
When you understand.

Master yourself, master yourself,  
That's the wise one's trade.  
Master yourself, master yourself—  
You're the work you've made.

**Blues Notes:** Three craftsmen metaphors lead to the climax: *attānaṁ damayanti paṇḍitā* (the wise master themselves). The self is the ultimate material requiring skillful shaping.

### Verses 81-82: Rock and Lake

**Verse 81**

**The Blues Truth:**

Solid rock, solid rock,  
Wind can't shake it none.  
Solid rock, solid rock,  
Stands when the storm is done.

Blame comes, praise comes—  
The wise don't move at all.  
Blame comes, praise comes—  
They don't rise, they don't fall.

**Verse 82**

**The Blues Truth:**

Deep lake, clear lake,  
Still water, no waves.  
Deep lake, clear lake—  
That's how the wise one saves.

After hearing Dhamma,  
After drinking truth,  
They settle deep and clear—  
Not stirred, not troubled, smooth.

Rock in the wind.  
Lake under sky.  
That's the wise one's mind—  
Unmoved, clarified.

**Blues Notes:** Two great images: *selo ekaghano* (solid rock) unmoved by *nindāpasaṁsā* (blame and praise); *rahado gambhīro* (deep lake) that becomes calm (*vippasīdanti*) after hearing Dhamma.

### Verse 83: Even in Pleasure, Even in Pain

**The Blues Truth:**

True people renounce, renounce,  
Wherever they may be.  
Good folks don't chatter about pleasure—  
They're working to be free.

Pleasure touches them?  
They don't fly up high.  
Suffering touches them?  
They don't fall down and cry.

No elation, no depression,  
No elation, no depression—  
Even ground in every weather,  
That's the wise one's session.

**Blues Notes:** *N'occāvacaṁ dassayanti* (show neither ups nor downs). Equanimity isn't suppression—it's deep stability. Pleasure and pain still come; the wise simply aren't thrown by them.

### Verse 84: Not for Self, Not for Other

**The Blues Truth:**

Not for myself, not for another,  
Not for child, riches, or throne—  
Don't seek what's wrong to own.

Don't want success through cheating,  
Don't want the crooked gain.  
Be virtuous, be wise, be righteous—  
That's the wise one's campaign.

**Blues Notes:** *Na attahetu na parassa hetu* (not for self, not for other) eliminates both selfishness AND misguided altruism. *Adhammena samiddhi* (success through corruption) is specifically rejected.

### Verses 85-86: Few Cross to the Other Shore

**The Blues Truth:**

Few people cross, few people cross,  
Most just run along the bank.  
Few people cross, few people cross,  
While the others break rank.

But those who live the Dhamma,  
Those who walk the well-taught way—  
THEY cross Death's hard river,  
THEY reach the other day.

Running on the bank, running on the bank—  
Busy but never arriving.  
Crossing to the shore, crossing to the shore—  
That's the wise one's thriving.

**Blues Notes:** *Pāragāmino* (those who go to the other shore) is liberation's classic image. Most people *tīram evānudhāvati* (just run along the bank)—lots of activity, never crossing.

### Verses 87-89: Letting Go to Shine

**Verse 87**

**The Blues Truth:**

Abandon the dark, develop the light.  
Leave home for homelessness.  
Find solitude, where delight is hard—  
That's the wise one's test.

**Verse 88**

**The Blues Truth:**

Learn to love that lonely place,  
Give up pleasures, own nothing.  
The wise one purifies the heart  
Of all its clinging.

**Verse 89**

**The Blues Truth:**

Those whose minds are well-developed  
In the factors of awakening—  
Who let go of grasping,  
Delighting in unattaching—

Pollutant-free, pollutant-free,  
Shining like the sun!  
Emancipated in this world—  
The wise one's work is done.

Shining forth, shining forth,  
No more taints to bind.  
Shining forth, shining forth—  
The liberated mind.

**Blues Notes:** *Khīṇāsavā jutimanto* (pollutant-free, shining forth). The āsavas (taints of sensuality, becoming, ignorance) are destroyed. *Parinibbutā* (emancipated in the world)—the final state of the wise.

**Blues Notes on Translation Method:**

The wise one is the opposite of the fool—but that doesn't mean cold or distant. The wise one drinks Dhamma, keeps good company, stands firm in storms, and eventually shines forth like the sun. Every Blues singer who found their way out of suffering knows this path: stay steady, find true friends, do the inner work, and one day you shine.
