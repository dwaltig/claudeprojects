# Chapter 14: Buddhavagga - Blues Edition
## The Buddha: Pathless, Trackless, Supreme

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

The Buddha. The awakened one. Victory that can't be undone, range that's endless, path that can't be traced. This chapter focuses on the *person* of the Awakened One—the rare, pathless being who leaves no track for desire to follow.

### Verses 179-180: The Pathless One

**The Blues Truth:**

His victory can't be undone, undone,  
Nobody in the world comes close.  
The Buddha, endless in his range—  
The pathless one, beyond reproach.

By what path can you lead him?  
By what path can you lead him?  
No craving leads him anywhere—  
By what path can you lead him?

Trackless, trackless,  
Like birds in the sky.  
No way to follow him back—  
He's already too high.

**Blues Notes:** *Apada* (pathless, without track)—the Buddha leaves no trace. *Kena padena nessatha* (by what path can you lead?)—the liberated one cannot be led by desire.

### Verses 181-182: Four Rare Things

**The Blues Truth:**

Even the gods are jealous, jealous,  
Of those who meditate and know.  
Even the gods look down with envy  
On the fully awakened ones below.

FOUR RARE THINGS, FOUR RARE THINGS:

Rare to be born human.  
Rare this mortal life.  
Rare to hear the True Dhamma.  
Rare when a Buddha arrives.

Rare, rare, rare, rare—  
Don't waste what you've got.  
This opportunity is precious—  
Most beings don't get this shot.

**Blues Notes:** *Kiccha* (rare)—human birth, mortal life, hearing Dhamma, Buddha's arising. We've already won the lottery; don't waste the ticket.

### Verse 183: The Teaching of ALL Buddhas

**The Blues Truth:**

DON'T DO EVIL.  
DO WHAT'S GOOD.  
PURIFY YOUR MIND.

That's it.  
That's the teaching.  
That's what every Buddha said.

Don't do evil, do what's good,  
Purify your mind, your mind.  
Simple to say, lifetime to do—  
That's the teaching you'll find.

**Blues Notes:** *Sabbapāpassa akaraṇaṁ, kusalassa upasampadā, sacittapariyodapanaṁ*—the famous three-part summary. This is IT. Everything else is commentary.

### Verses 184-185: Non-Harm and Practice

**The Blues Truth:**

Patience is the supreme austerity, austerity.  
Nibbāna is supreme, say the Buddhas.  
Those gone forth don't hurt another—  
Ascetics don't harass.

Not finding fault.  
Not hurting.  
Restrained by discipline.  
Knowing the right measure of food.  
Living remote.  
Devoted to meditation.

THAT'S the teaching of the Buddhas.

### Verses 186-187: No Satisfaction in Pleasure

**The Blues Truth:**

Rain down coins, rain down coins—  
Satisfaction won't be found.  
Sense pleasures have little joy  
And much suffering around.

Even heavenly pleasures, heavenly pleasures,  
Don't satisfy the wise.  
The Buddha's disciple delights  
In craving's final demise.

Not in getting more, more, more—  
In ENDING the wanting.  
That's where joy is, that's where peace is—  
In craving's end, not craving's haunting.
