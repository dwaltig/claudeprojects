# Chapter 27: Nibbanavagga - Blues Edition
## Nirvana: The Unconditioned Shore

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

This chapter—reconstructed from the "bookends" of the old final chapter—focuses purely on the destination: **Nibbāna**. It opens with the call to "cut the stream" and know the Unconditioned, and it closes with the description of the one who has crossed over. This is about the *state* of liberation itself.

### Verses 383-384: Strive and Cut the Stream

**The Blues Truth:**

STRIVE. Cut off the stream.  
Remove desire, seeker.  
Know the destruction of the conditioned—  
Be one who knows the UNCONDITIONED.

When through TWO things  
The seeker has crossed over—  
Concentration and insight,  
Calm and seeing—  
All fetters are laid to rest  
For one who knows.

THAT one I call a brahmin.

---

### Verse 385: No Near Shore, No Far Shore

**The Blues Truth:**

For whom the near shore doesn't exist,  
The far shore doesn't exist,  
NEITHER shore exists—

Free of anxiety,  
Detached—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

What's the near shore? This life of clinging.  
What's the far shore? The next life.  
Transcend BOTH.

---

### Verse 386: The Dustless Meditator

**The Blues Truth:**

The meditator sitting down,  
DUSTLESS,  
Who has done the duty,  
Without pollutants,  
Who has reached the ultimate good—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

Not just sitting.  
DUSTLESS sitting.  
Duty DONE.  
That's the real thing.

---

### Verse 411: Immersion in the Deathless

**The Blues Truth:**

For one who has NO desires,  
Who through knowledge is without doubt,  
Who has reached IMMERSION in the deathless—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

IMMERSION.  
Plunged into the undying.

---

### Verse 412: Beyond Merit and Demerit

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever here has overcome  
Clinging to BOTH merit AND demerit—  
Griefless, dustless, pure—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

Even good karma can be a chain  
If you CLING to it.  
Go beyond BOTH.

---

### Verse 413: Pure Like the Moon

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever, just like the MOON,  
Is stainless, pure,  
Clear and undisturbed—  
Has destroyed JOY IN EXISTENCE—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

The moon—spotless, bright, serene.  
That's the image.

---

### Verse 414: Crossed the Dangerous Path

**The Blues Truth:**

He who has crossed the difficult  
And dangerous path  
Through births and deaths and delusion—  
The meditator who has crossed to the further shore,  
Free of lust, free of doubt,  
Unattached and COOLED DOWN—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

The crossing is DONE.  
The far shore REACHED.

---

### Verses 415-416: Giving Up Craving and Desire

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever, giving up SENSUAL DESIRES,  
Would wander homeless here—  
Destroying desires and existence—  
THAT one I call a brahmin.

Whoever, giving up CRAVING,  
Would wander homeless here—  
Destroying craving and existence—  
THAT one I call a brahmin.

Two verses, same message:  
Let go. Let go. Let go.

---

### Verses 417-418: Beyond All Yokes

**The Blues Truth:**

Abandoning the HUMAN yoke,  
Overcoming the DIVINE yoke,  
Unattached to ALL yokes—  
THAT one I call a brahmin.

Abandoning DELIGHT and AVERSION,  
Cooled off, free from cleaving,  
A HERO who vanquished the whole world—  
THAT one I call a brahmin.

Beyond human bindings.  
Beyond heavenly bindings.  
Completely FREE.

---

### Verse 419: Knows Beings' Passing and Rebirth

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever knows in EVERY way  
Beings' passing and their rebirth—  
Unattached, fortunate, AWAKE—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

Sees the whole show.  
Birth after birth.  
Death after death.  
And stands OUTSIDE it.

---

### Verse 420: Unknown Destiny

**The Blues Truth:**

For one whose DESTINY is unknown  
To gods, gandhabbas, and men—  
Being pollutant-free, an ARAHAT—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

Where's that one going?  
No one knows.  
Beyond all tracking.

---

### Verse 421: Nothing in Past, Present, or Future

**The Blues Truth:**

For whom there is NOTHING  
In the past,  
The future,  
Or the present—  
Having nothing, unattached—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

Three times: nothing.  
Past, present, future: nothing.  
THAT'S freedom.

---

### Verse 422: The Noble Leader

**The Blues Truth:**

A NOBLE leader,  
HEROIC,  
A great seer,  
VICTORIOUS—  
Free of lust,  
CLEANSED and AWAKENED—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

Every noble quality.  
All in one being.

---

### Verse 423: The Final Verse

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever knows their FORMER lives,  
And sees heaven and the downfall,  
And has attained BIRTH'S DESTRUCTION—  
The sage, accomplished in deep knowledge,  
Who is accomplished in ALL accomplishments—

THAT one I call a brahmin.
