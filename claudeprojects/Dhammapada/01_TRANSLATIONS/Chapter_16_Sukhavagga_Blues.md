# Chapter 15: Sukhavagga - Blues Edition
## Happiness: The Real Kind

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

What's real happiness? Not winning—the victor breeds hatred. Not possessions—we'll feed on joy like divine beings. Not longing—live without craving among the cravers. Peace is supreme happiness. Contentment is supreme wealth. Nibbāna is the supreme good. This chapter tells you what REAL happiness tastes like.

### Verses 197-200: Let Us Live Happily

**The Blues Truth:**

Let us live happily, happily,  
Without hate among the haters.  
Let us live happily, happily—  
Free while they're in chains.

Let us live happily, happily,  
Without sickness among the sick.  
Let us live happily, happily—  
While others feel affliction's prick.

Let us live happily, happily,  
Without longing among the longers.  
Let us live happily, happily—  
Free from wanting's hunger.

We live happily, happily,  
We who have nothing to own.  
We feed on joy, pure joy—  
Like gods of light have shown.

**Blues Notes:** *Susukhaṁ vata jīvāma* (we live truly happily) refrain. *Ābhassarā* gods feed on joy alone—that's the practitioner's model.

### Verses 201-204: Peace Is Supreme

**The Blues Truth:**

The victor breeds hatred, hatred.  
The loser finds pain.  
But the one AT PEACE lives happily,  
Dropped the whole victory game.

No fire like passion, passion.  
No offense like hate.  
No suffering like the aggregates—  
No happiness beyond peace's gate.

Hunger is the supreme sickness.  
Conditioned life is supreme pain.  
Know this, really know it—  
NIBBĀNA is the supreme gain.

Health is supreme gain.  
Contentment is supreme wealth.  
Trust is supreme kinship.  
Nibbāna is supreme health.

**Blues Notes:** *Natthi santiparaṁ sukhaṁ* (no happiness beyond peace). That's the core. Lists of supremes: health, contentment, trust, Nibbāna.

### Verses 205-208: Taste of Dhamma, Company of the Wise

**The Blues Truth:**

Taste the solitude, taste the peace—  
Become fearless, become clean.  
Drink the taste of Dhamma—  
Sweetest thing you've ever seen.

Meet the noble—that's good.  
Live with them—that's pleasant always.  
Don't meet fools—that's happy.  
That's the wise one's ways.

Consort with fools? Grieve long.  
Dwell with fools? Suffer like with foes.  
But dwell with the wise? Happy—  
Like family, and everybody knows.

So follow the firm, the wise, the learned,  
The virtuous, dutiful, true—  
Like the moon follows the stars through the sky,  
That's what the wise ones do.
