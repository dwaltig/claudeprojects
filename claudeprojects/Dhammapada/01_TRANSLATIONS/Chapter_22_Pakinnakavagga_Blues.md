# Chapter 21: Pakiṇṇakavagga - Blues Edition
## Miscellaneous: Collected Jewels from the Road

---

## Opening Words

This chapter's called Miscellaneous, but don't let that fool you. These are COLLECTED JEWELS—the teachings that didn't fit neatly into other boxes but are too precious to leave out. Think of it like the wise old man's pockets: whatever he pulls out is something you need right now.

### Verse 290: Trade Up, Not Down

**The Blues Truth:**

If you gotta give up something small  
To get something large,  
Baby, make that trade.  
A wise one sees the big picture—  
Renounce the little good  
For the greater good ahead.

Don't clutch pennies when dollars are waiting.  
Don't hoard crumbs when the feast is set.  
The wise one knows when to let go  
Of what's holding them back.

**Blues Notes:** *Mattāsukhapariccāgā*—renouncing a small pleasure. This ain't about deprivation. It's about WISDOM. You give up the candy to get the meal. You give up the instant gratification for the lasting peace.

### Verse 291: Can't Build Happiness on Someone Else's Pain

**The Blues Truth:**

You want happiness for yourself  
By making someone else suffer?  
Listen here, friend—  
That's building your house on quicksand.

You get tangled up with hatred that way,  
And hatred don't let go easy.  
You think you're winning,  
But you're just binding yourself tighter  
To the very thing you hate.

Can't be free from hatred  
While still dealing in hatred's business.  
That's just math, baby.

**Blues Notes:** *Verasaṁsaggasaṁsaṭṭho*—associated with hatred. Buddha's saying cause and effect is RELENTLESS. Hurt others to help yourself, and you stay bound to that hurt.

### Verses 292-293: What Needs Doing vs. What Doesn't

**The Blues Truth:**

Here's how the pollutants GROW:  
You leave undone what needs doing,  
And do what doesn't need doing.  
Insolent. Heedless. Proud.  
Your spiritual pollution just keeps rising like floodwaters.

But here's how the pollutants DIE:  
Mindfulness of the body—keep it going.  
Don't practice what shouldn't be practiced.  
Persist in what SHOULD be done.  
Mindful. Fully aware.  
The pollutants settle down like mud in still water.

That's the choice every day, every hour—  
What am I feeding?  
The peace or the poison?

**Blues Notes:** *Āsavā* are the deep pollutants—things like sensual craving, craving for existence, and ignorance. They INCREASE with heedlessness and DECREASE with mindfulness. Simple equation, hard practice.

### Verses 294-295: The Riddle of Destroying Mother and Father

**The Blues Truth:**

Now this one sounds WILD—  
"Destroying mother and father,  
Two noble kings,  
A kingdom and its followers—  
The brahmin proceeds untroubled."

What?! The Buddha telling us to kill folks?  
NAH, baby. Listen deeper.

MOTHER is craving.  
FATHER is conceit.  
The TWO KINGS are eternalism and annihilationism—  
Wrong views on both sides.  
The KINGDOM is the sense-bases with their objects.  
The FOLLOWER is delight in attachment.

Destroy THOSE, and you walk free—  
Untroubled, unburdened, awake.

The second verse adds "a tiger as the fifth"—  
That's the five hindrances:  
Desire, ill-will, sloth, restlessness, doubt.  
Cut them down!

**Blues Notes:** This is classic Buddhist encryption—outrageous statements that reveal profound meaning when decoded. The Buddha wasn't advocating violence; he was using shock value to wake people up.

### Verses 296-301: The Six Recollections—Awake Well

**The Blues Truth:**

Gotama's disciples AWAKE WELL.  
What does that mean?  
Day and night, they keep mindfulness of:

**THE BUDDHA—**  
Remembering the Awakened One,  
His qualities, his path, his victory.  
That's verse 296.

**THE DHAMMA—**  
Remembering the Teaching,  
Visible here and now, inviting investigation,  
Leading onward for the wise.  
That's verse 297.

**THE SANGHA—**  
Remembering the Community,  
Practicing well, worthy of respect,  
Field of merit for the world.  
That's verse 298.

**THE BODY—**  
Remembering this body,  
Breath by breath, step by step,  
Knowing what's happening right now.  
That's verse 299.

**NON-VIOLENCE—**  
Delighting in harmlessness,  
At peace with all beings,  
No wish to hurt.  
That's verse 300.

**CULTIVATION—**  
Delighting in development,  
Growing the wholesome,  
Tending the garden of the mind.  
That's verse 301.

Six doors to waking well.  
Use them all, use them daily.  
THAT'S what Gotama's disciples do.

**Blues Notes:** *Suppabuddhaṁ pabujjhanti*—they awake to a good awakening. The Buddha is teaching HOW to wake up right. These six recollections are practical tools, not just devotional sentiments.

### Verse 302: Hard Either Way—Choose Your Hard

**The Blues Truth:**

Listen, going forth is HARD.  
Finding delight in renunciation? HARD.  
But living in households? ALSO HARD.  
Suffering alongside people different from you? HARD.  
Being a traveler in this round of births? HARD.  
Being affected by suffering? HARD.

So here's the thing—  
Life is hard either way.  
You gonna suffer at home,  
You gonna struggle on the path.

But one leads to freedom,  
And one keeps you spinning.

So don't be a traveler forever.  
Don't keep getting affected by suffering.  
CHOOSE the hard that leads somewhere.

**Blues Notes:** *Dukkhānupatitaddhagū*—travelers affected by suffering. The Buddha's not promising an easy road, but he IS pointing to the road that ends.

### Verse 303: The Faithful One Shines Everywhere

**The Blues Truth:**

You got faith?  
You got virtue?  
You got wealth and a good name?

Then wherever you go, baby,  
WHEREVER you go—  
You're honored right there and then.

This ain't about popularity.  
This is about INTEGRITY.  
When you're really walking the walk,  
People recognize it.  
It shines through.

**Blues Notes:** *Tattha tattheva pūjito*—right there and then he is worshipped. The Buddha's describing the natural magnetism of genuine virtue.

### Verse 304: The Good Shine Like Mountains

**The Blues Truth:**

THE GOOD shine from far away—  
Like the Himalayas covered in snow.  
You can see 'em from miles off.  
That brilliance can't be hidden.

But the WICKED?  
They're invisible here—  
Like arrows shot in the night.  
You don't see 'em till they hit.

So ask yourself:  
Am I a snow-capped mountain?  
Or an arrow in the dark?

**Blues Notes:** *Himavanto va pabbato*—like a snow-covered mountain. Himalaya literally means "abode of snow." The comparison is striking: goodness is VISIBLE, wickedness hides.

---

### Verse 305: The Solitary One at the Forest's Edge

**The Blues Truth:**

Sitting alone.  
Lying down alone.  
Walking alone.  
DILIGENT.

The solitary one who trains oneself—  
Ah, that one will find delight  
At the forest's edge.

Not lonely—ALONE.  
There's a difference.  
Lonely is empty.  
Alone is FULL.

The one who's really working on themselves,  
They don't need the crowd.  
They find peace in the quiet,  
Joy in the practice,  
Liberation in the solitude.

**Blues Notes:** *Vanante ramito siyā*—will delight in the edge of a forest. The "forest's edge" is both literal (a place for meditation) and metaphorical (the boundary between the conditioned world and Nibbāna).
