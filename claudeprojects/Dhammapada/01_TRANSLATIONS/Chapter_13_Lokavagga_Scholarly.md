# Chapter 13: Lokavagga (The World)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Lokavagga

The thirteenth chapter addresses *loka* (the world)—its nature, dangers, and how to see through it. The world is a bubble, a mirage, a gilded chariot where fools become depressed. Yet one who was heedless but becomes heedful shines like the moon breaking through clouds. The chapter culminates with stream-entry being superior to world sovereignty.

### Verses 167-169: Living by Dhamma

**Verse 167**

One should not follow lowly things,  
One should not abide heedlessly,  
One should not follow wrong view,  
One should not foster worldliness.

**Verse 168-169**

One should strive, not be heedless,  
Live by Dhamma with good conduct.  
Living by Dhamma, one lives at ease  
In this world and the next.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **The Dhammacārī**: *Hīna dhamma* (lowly things) and *micchādiṭṭhi* (wrong view) are to be avoided. *Lokavaḍḍhano* (fostering worldliness) keeps one trapped. The repeated refrain *asmiṁ loke paramhi ca* (in this world and the next) emphasizes that ethical living pays dividends everywhere.

### Verses 170-171: Bubble, Mirage, Gilded Chariot

**Verse 170**

See it as a bubble,  
See it as a mirage—  
Looking on the world in this way,  
The King of Death does not see one.

**Verse 171**

Come, look upon this world  
Adorned like a king's gilded chariot—  
Where fools become depressed.  
There is no bond for those who understand.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **Seeing Through Illusion**: *Bubbuḷaka* (bubble) and *marīcikā* (mirage) are classic impermanence images—both appear solid but are empty. *Rājarathūpama* (like a king's chariot)—the world's glamour is beautiful but binding. *Bālā visīdanti* (fools become depressed) when it inevitably fails. *Natthi saṅgo vijānataṁ* (no bond for those who understand)—insight liberates.

### Verses 172-173: Moon Breaking Through Clouds

**Verse 172**

Whoever was heedless before  
But later becomes not heedless—  
That one shines brightly on this world  
Like the moon released from a cloud.

**Verse 173**

One whose wicked deed done  
Is covered over by doing good—  
That one shines brightly on this world  
Like the moon released from a cloud.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Transformation and Redemption**: *Abbhā mutto va candimā* (like moon released from cloud) appears twice. Past heedlessness (*pubbe pamajjitvā*) or past evil (*pāpaṁ kataṁ kammaṁ*) can be overcome. The cloud obscures but doesn't destroy the moon—the luminous nature remains and can be revealed.

### Verses 174-175: Few Escape, Few Fly

**Verse 174**

This world is blind;  
Few here have true insight.  
As few go to heaven  
As birds that escape from the net.

**Verse 175**

Geese go through the path of the sky;  
They go through the firmament by their power.  
The wise are led out of the world  
After defeating Māra and his host.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **Movement Upward**: *Andhabhūto ayaṁ loko* (this world is blind). *Sakunto jālamutto va* (like birds escaping the net)—few achieve liberation. *Haṁsādiccapathe yanti* (geese go through the sun's path)—high fliers. *Nīyanti dhīrā lokamhā, jetvā Māraṁ savāhanaṁ* (the wise are led out, defeating Māra and his host)—liberation as victory.

### Verses 176-177: The Liar and the Miser

**Verse 176**

For the person speaking falsely,  
Who has transgressed in this one thing,  
Who has abandoned the next world—  
There is no wickedness left undone.

**Verse 177**

The miserly go not to the world of the gods;  
Fools surely do not praise giving.  
But the wise one rejoices in giving  
And through that is happy hereafter.[5]

#### Footnotes

[5] **Two Obstacles**: Lying (*musāvāda*) destroys ethical foundation: once truth is abandoned, all wickedness follows. Miserliness (*kadariya*) blocks heaven. *Dhīro dānaṁ anumodamāno* (the wise rejoice in giving)—generosity leads to happiness here and hereafter.

### Verse 178: Better Than World Sovereignty

**Verse 178**

Having sole sovereignty over the earth,  
Or going to heaven,  
Or lordship over the whole world—  
Better is the fruit of stream-entry.[6]

#### Footnotes

[6] **The Value of Stream-Entry**: *Pathavyā ekarajjena* (sole sovereignty over earth), *saggassa gamanena* (going to heaven), *sabbalokādhipaccena* (lordship over all worlds)—maximum worldly success. Yet *sotāpattiphalaṁ varaṁ* (better is stream-entry fruit). Stream-entry (*sotāpatti*) is the first stage of enlightenment, guaranteeing no more than seven rebirths and never in lower realms—infinitely superior to any worldly gain.
