# Chapter 25: Bhikkhuvagga - Blues Edition
## The Monk: Portrait of the Practitioner

---

## Opening Words

Who is the real monk? Not the one who wears the robe. Not the one who shaves the head. Not the one who begs for food. The REAL monk is the one who restrains, who meditates, who cuts off passion and hatred, who shines like the moon from behind clouds. This chapter paints that portrait—23 verses on what it really means to walk this path.

### Verses 360-361: Restraint of the Six Doors

**The Blues Truth:**

Restraint of the EYE is good.  
Restraint of the EAR is good.  
Restraint of the NOSE is good.  
Restraint of the TONGUE is good.

Restraint of the BODY is good.  
Restraint of SPEECH is good.  
Restraint of the MIND is good.  
Restraint is EVERYWHERE good.

The monk restrained everywhere?  
Liberated from ALL suffering.

Six doors. Seven gates.  
Close the ones that need closing.  
Open the ones that need opening.  
THAT'S the practice.

**Blues Notes:** *Sabbattha saṁvuto bhikkhu sabbadukkhā pamuccati*—the monk restrained everywhere is freed from all suffering. This is the fruit of restraint: complete liberation.

---

### Verse 362: The True Monk

**The Blues Truth:**

Controls his HANDS.  
Controls his FEET.  
Controls his SPEECH.  
Controls the MIND supreme.

Has inner delight.  
Has composure.  
Is solitary.  
Is content.

THAT one is called a monk.

Not the robe.  
Not the bowl.  
Not the head-shaving.  
The CONTROL—that makes the monk.

---

### Verse 363: Sweet Speech

**The Blues Truth:**

That monk who restrains the mouth,  
Who speaks WELL,  
Who is modest—

Who explains the MEANING of Dhamma—  
That one's speech is SWEET.

Not sugary. Not flattering.  
SWEET—like honey that heals.  
Truth spoken beautifully.  
That's what a monk's words should sound like.

---

### Verse 364: Delighting in Dhamma

**The Blues Truth:**

The one who finds PLEASURE in Dhamma,  
Who DELIGHTS in Dhamma,  
Who REFLECTS on Dhamma,  
Who REMEMBERS Dhamma—

That monk does NOT fall away  
From the Good Dhamma.

Four ways to stay close:  
Pleasure. Delight. Reflection. Remembrance.  
Keep the Dhamma in your heart,  
And you won't lose the way.

---

### Verses 365-366: Don't Despise Your Gains

**The Blues Truth:**

Don't despise what you've got.  
Don't live envious of others.

The monk envious of others?  
Does NOT attain concentration.  
Can't settle the mind  
When it's busy comparing.

Even if you gain LITTLE,  
Don't despise your gains.  
Even the GODS praise  
The one of pure life who is diligent.

Take what comes.  
Practice with THAT.  
Envy blocks the path.

---

### Verse 367: No Fondness for Mind and Body

**The Blues Truth:**

The one who has NO fondness  
For mind and body—  
Not attached to name-and-form—

Who grieves not  
For what does not exist—

THAT one is surely called a monk.

No clinging to this heap of processes.  
No mourning for what's already gone.  
Clean. Clear. Free.

---

### Verse 368: Dwelling in Loving-Kindness

**The Blues Truth:**

The monk who DWELLS in loving-kindness,  
With FAITH in Buddha's teaching—

Should attain the state of PEACE,  
The joy in stilling ALL conditions.

Mettā—loving-kindness—  
That's the dwelling place.  
Faith—that's the foundation.  
Peace—that's the destination.

---

### Verse 369: Bail Out This Boat

**The Blues Truth:**

BAIL OUT this boat, monk!  
When it's bailed out,  
It'll go LIGHTLY.

Cut off PASSION.  
Cut off HATRED.  
Then from here  
You'll go to NIBBĀNA.

Your boat's taking on water.  
Passion and hatred are the leaks.  
Bail them out.  
Plug the holes.  
Then you'll sail smooth.

**Blues Notes:** *Siñca bhikkhu imaṁ nāvaṁ*—bail out this boat, monk. The body/mind is the boat. Passion and hatred are the water flooding in. Keep bailing.

---

### Verse 370: The Rule of Fives

**The Blues Truth:**

CUT five.  
ABANDON five.  
CULTIVATE five more.

The monk who surmounts five attachments  
Is called a FLOOD-CROSSER.

What are these fives?  
**Cut**: the five lower fetters (identity view, doubt, rites-and-rituals clinging, sensual desire, ill-will).  
**Abandon**: the five higher fetters (craving for form, craving for formless, conceit, restlessness, ignorance).  
**Cultivate**: the five spiritual faculties (faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom).  
**Surmount**: the five attachments (passion, hatred, delusion, conceit, wrong view).

Cross the flood.

---

### Verse 371: Meditate, Monk!

**The Blues Truth:**

MEDITATE, monk!  
Do NOT be heedless!

Don't let your mind  
SWIRL around in strands of desire.

Don't, heedless,  
SWALLOW a hot iron ball.

Don't, while BURNING,  
Cry out: "This is suffering!"

By then it's too late.  
Practice NOW.  
Before the burning.

---

### Verse 372: Jhāna and Paññā

**The Blues Truth:**

No CONCENTRATION for one without wisdom.  
No WISDOM for one without concentration.

But the one who has BOTH—  
Concentration AND wisdom—  
Is in the PRESENCE of Nibbāna.

Can't have one without the other.  
They feed each other.  
They need each other.  
Get BOTH.

---

### Verse 373: Superhuman Delight

**The Blues Truth:**

For the one who enters an EMPTY place,  
With a PEACEFUL mind—

There is SUPERHUMAN delight  
From insight into true Dhamma.

Superhuman.  
Not the pleasure of the senses.  
Not the happiness of getting.  
SUPERHUMAN—the delight of seeing true.

That's what waits in the empty room  
For the peaceful mind.

---

### Verse 374: The Rise and Fall

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever has right MINDFULNESS  
Regarding the RISE and FALL  
Of the components of mind and body—

Gains JOY and HAPPINESS.

That is the DEATHLESS state  
For the one who knows.

Rise and fall.  
Rising and passing.  
See it clearly,  
And touch the deathless.

---

### Verses 375-376: The Beginning for the Wise Monk

**The Blues Truth:**

THIS is the very beginning  
For the wise monk:

CONTENTMENT.  
GUARDING the senses.  
RESTRAINT in the regulations.

Resort to SPIRITUAL FRIENDS—  
Ones of pure life,  
Ones who are diligent.

Be FRIENDLY in disposition.  
Be SKILFUL in conduct.

Rejoicing because of THAT—  
One will make an END to suffering.

Start here.  
Good friends. Sense restraint. Contentment.  
THAT'S how you begin.

---

### Verse 377: Cast Off Like Withered Flowers

**The Blues Truth:**

Just as the striped jasmine  
Casts off its withered flowers—

So, monks,  
Cast off PASSION and HATRED.

The flower doesn't cling  
To what's dead.  
Neither should you.

Let it fall.  
Let it go.  
Passion. Hatred.  
Cast them off.

---

### Verse 378: The One at Peace

**The Blues Truth:**

CALM in body.  
CALM in speech.  
Having calmness and composure.

Having thrown off worldly gain—

THAT monk is called  
One at PEACE.

*Upasanto*—at peace.  
Not chasing.  
Not grasping.  
CALM through and through.

---

### Verses 379-380: Self Is the Refuge

**The Blues Truth:**

By ONESELF one should censure self.  
By ONESELF one should be controlled.

He who guards himself, mindful,  
Will live HAPPILY, monk.

SELF is the protector of self.  
SELF is the refuge of self.

Therefore restrain yourself—  
Like a merchant restrains his noble horse.

You're the one.  
No one else can do it for you.  
Guard yourself.  
Train yourself.  
Be your own refuge.

---

### Verse 381: The State of Peace Again

**The Blues Truth:**

The monk having much HAPPINESS,  
With FAITH in the Buddha's teaching—

Could attain the state of PEACE,  
Happy in the stilling of ALL conditions.

This verse repeats the promise:  
Faith + Joy = Peace.  
The path is well-marked.

---

### Verse 382: The Young Monk Shines

**The Blues Truth:**

That YOUNG monk  
Who is devoted to the Buddha's teaching—

SHINES FORTH in this world  
Like the MOON freed from a cloud.

Young in years, maybe.  
But devoted?  
DEVOTED.

That one SHINES.  
The cloud passes.  
The moon appears.  
Brilliant. Pure. Light.
