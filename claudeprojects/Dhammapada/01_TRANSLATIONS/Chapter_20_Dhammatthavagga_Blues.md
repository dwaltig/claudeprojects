# Chapter 19: Dhammaṭṭhavagga - Blues Edition
## The Just: Not by X Are You Y

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

Not by talking much are you wise. Not by grey hair are you an elder. Not by shaved head are you an ascetic. This chapter strips away external markers and asks: what are you REALLY? The answer is always in the practice, not the appearance.

### Verses 256-259: Talking Much Means Nothing

**The Blues Truth:**

Rush to settle a case? That's not Dhamma.  
The wise one weighs both sides,  
Settles without haste, justly, fair—  
THAT'S where Dhamma resides.

Talk a lot? That doesn't make you wise.  
Safe, hatred-free, fearless—  
THAT'S what makes a wise one rise.

Speak much Dhamma? That doesn't make you a bearer.  
But hear a little and SEE it in yourself?  
THAT makes you a Dhamma-carer.

**Blues Notes:** *Bahu bhāsati* (speaking much) doesn't make wisdom. *Dhammaṁ kāyena passati* (sees Dhamma in the body)—direct experience matters.

### Verses 260-265: Not by Grey Hair

**The Blues Truth:**

Not by GREY HAIR are you an elder, elder.  
Just aged? That's old in vain.  
But with truth, Dhamma, non-violence,  
Restraint and training—THAT'S the elder's domain.

Not by ELOQUENCE or BEAUTY are you honorable.  
Still jealous, selfish, deceitful inside?  
Cut that out at the root—  
THEN you're honorable, nothing to hide.

Not by SHAVED HEAD are you an ascetic, ascetic.  
Lacking vows, speaking lies, full of greed?  
Pacify wicked deeds, small and great—  
THAT'S the ascetic's creed.

### Verses 266-272: True Monastics, True Seers

**The Blues Truth:**

Not by eating almsfood are you a monastic.  
Ward off merit AND demerit,  
Walk with discrimination—  
THAT'S what makes you fit.

Not by SILENCE is a fool a seer.  
Hold the balance, take what's noble—  
The seer rejects wicked deeds,  
Understands both worlds, stays stable.

Not by HURTING living beings are you noble.  
Not hurt ANY breathing thing—  
THAT'S what makes you noble.

Not by virtue, vows, learning,  
Concentration, secluded space—  
DO I achieve renunciation's joy.  
Don't be confident, don't lose the race—  
Until the pollutants are DESTROYED.
