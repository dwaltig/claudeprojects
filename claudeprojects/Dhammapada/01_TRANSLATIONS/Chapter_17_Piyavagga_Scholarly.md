# Chapter 16: Piyavagga (What Is Dear)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Piyavagga

The sixteenth chapter examines *piya* (what is loved/dear)—the source of both joy and suffering. Through a powerful series of parallel verses, the Buddha traces grief and fear to their roots in love, fondness, delight, desire, and craving. Freedom from attachment means freedom from grief and fear.

### Verses 209-211: The Danger of Clinging

**Verse 209**

Engaging in what is not suitable,  
Not engaging in what is suitable,  
Abandoning the good, grasping what is loved—  
One envies those who apply themselves.

**Verse 210**

Do not associate with those you love  
Or with those you don't love—  
Suffering comes from not seeing the loved  
And suffering from seeing the unloved.

**Verse 211**

Therefore, hold nothing as dear;  
Losing what is loved is painful.  
There are no bonds for those  
Who hold nothing as loved or unloved.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **The Attachment Trap**: *Piyāpāyo hi pāpako* (losing what is loved is loathsome)—attachment guarantees eventual suffering. *Ganthā tesaṁ na vijjanti* (no knots for those) who have transcended both *piya* (loved) and *appiya* (unloved).

### Verses 212-216: The Five Sources of Grief and Fear

**Verse 212-216**

From love arises grief; from love arises fear.  
For one free from love, there is no grief—how could there be fear?

From fondness arises grief; from fondness arises fear.  
For one free from fondness, there is no grief—how could there be fear?

From delight arises grief; from delight arises fear.  
For one free from delight, there is no grief—how could there be fear?

From desire arises grief; from desire arises fear.  
For one free from desire, there is no grief—how could there be fear?

From craving arises grief; from craving arises fear.  
For one free from craving, there is no grief—how could there be fear?[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **Cascading Analysis**: Five terms trace the root: *piya* (love), *pema* (fondness), *rati* (delight), *kāma* (desire), *taṇhā* (craving). Each verse identical in structure: *jāyatī soko, jāyatī bhayaṁ* (arises grief, arises fear). The rhetorical question *kuto bhayaṁ?* (how is there fear?) emphasizes liberation's freedom.

### Verses 217-220: True Love and Merit

**Verse 217**

One endowed with virtue and insight,  
Principled, knowing the truths,  
Doing one's own proper work—  
That one the people love.

**Verses 218-220**

One with desire for the undeclared,  
Mind suffused with awakening,  
Unattached to sense pleasures—  
Is called "one gone upstream."

When one long absent returns safely from afar,  
Relatives, friends, and companions rejoice.  
Just so, when one who has made merit  
Goes from this world to the next,  
Merit receives them like family  
Welcoming a loved one home.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Wholesome Love**: Not all love imprisons. *Sīladassanasampanna* (endowed with virtue and insight) generates proper admiration. Merit (*puñña*) accompanies us to the next life like family welcoming travelers home.
