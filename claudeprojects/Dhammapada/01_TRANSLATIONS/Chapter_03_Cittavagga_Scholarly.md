# Chapter 3: Cittavagga (The Mind)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Cittavagga

The third chapter addresses *citta* (mind)—the fundamental arena of Buddhist training. While Chapter 1 established mind as the creator of experience and Chapter 2 emphasized heedfulness, this chapter examines the mind itself: its wildness, its danger when misdirected, its power when trained, and its ultimate potential for liberation.

The eleven verses progress from vivid images of the untrained mind (fish out of water, flitting bird) through the discipline of mental restraint to the transformative insight that a well-directed mind surpasses any gift that relatives could give.

### Verses 33-34: The Untrained Mind

**Verse 33**

An agitated, unsteady mind,  
Difficult to guard, difficult to ward—  
The sagacious one makes straight,  
As a fletcher straightens an arrow.[1]

**Verse 34**

Like a fish thrown upon dry land,  
Pulled from its watery home,  
This mind thrashes about—  
Therefore, throw off Māra's dominion.[2]

#### Footnotes

[1] **The Fletcher Metaphor**: *Phandanaṁ capalaṁ* (agitated, unsteady) describes the untrained mind's constant motion. The fletcher (*usukāra*) metaphor appears throughout early Buddhist literature—the skilled craftsman straightening the arrow shaft represents the meditator's patient, skilled work of aligning the mind. Neither forceful nor passive, it requires sustained attention.

[2] **The Fish Metaphor**: *Vārijo va thale khitto* ("like a fish thrown on dry land") powerfully evokes the mind's distress when removed from its habitual element (sense-pleasure) and exposed to the "dry land" of renunciation and restraint. *Māradheyya* (Māra's dominion/sway) is where the unrestrained mind lives. The verse urges practitioners to use this very agitation as motivation to break free.

### Verses 35-36: Restraining the Subtle Mind

**Verse 35**

For the mind that is difficult to subdue,  
Flighty, flitting wherever it will—  
Restraint is good; a restrained mind brings happiness.[3]

**Verse 36**

Hard to see, very subtle,  
Flitting wherever it desires—  
The sage should guard the mind;  
A guarded mind brings happiness.[4]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Difficulty and Reward**: *Dunniggaha* (difficult to subdue) and *lahuna* (flighty, light) characterize the untrained mind. *Yatthakāmanipātina* ("flitting wherever it will") captures mental wandering. The verse's conclusion is striking in its simplicity: restraint (*damatha*) leads to happiness (*sukhāvaha*). This contradicts the untrained mind's assumption that freedom from restraint equals happiness.

[4] **The Invisible Factor**: *Sududdasa* (hard to see) and *sunipuṇa* (very subtle) acknowledge mind's elusive nature—we can observe its contents more easily than the observer itself. Yet this subtle, nearly invisible process determines our entire experience. *Gutta* (guarded) parallels *danta* (restrained) from verse 35, establishing the dual practice of protection and training.

### Verse 37: Release from Māra's Bonds

**Verse 37**

Those who will restrain the mind  
That roams far, wanders alone,  
Bodiless, hidden in the cave—  
They gain release from Māra's bonds.[5]

#### Footnotes

[5] **Mind's Peculiar Nature**: Four qualities characterize mind: *dūraṅgama* (far-roaming—mind travels instantly to distant places and times), *ekacara* (wandering alone—each person's mind is radically private), *asarīra* (bodiless—has no physical form), *guhāsaya* (hidden in a cave—the "cave" is the heart or head, indicating mind's concealment). *Mārabandhanā* (Māra's bonds) are the bonds of death, desire, and delusion. Those who tame this elusive thing gain liberation.

### Verses 38-39: Unsettled and Settled Minds

**Verse 38**

For one whose mind is unsettled,  
Who does not know the True Dhamma,  
Whose confidence wavers—  
Wisdom is never fulfilled.[6]

**Verse 39**

For one whose mind is free from lust,  
Whose heart is unperplexed,  
Who has abandoned both merit and demerit—  
For the watchful one, there is no fear.[7]

#### Footnotes

[6] **Three Interdependent Deficiencies**: *Anavaṭṭhitacitta* (unsettled mind) leads to *avijānato saddhammaṁ* (not knowing true Dhamma), which produces *pariplavapasāda* (wavering confidence). The result: *paññā na paripūrati* (wisdom is unfulfilled). This verse shows how mental instability prevents spiritual development—not through moral failing but through the simple inability to sustain attention long enough to understand.

[7] **The Fearless State**: *Anavassutacitta* (free from lust—literally "not flowing out" toward objects) and *ananvāhatacetaso* (unperplexed, not struck by confusion). Most striking is *puññapāpapahīnassa*—having abandoned both merit and demerit. This represents the arahat state, beyond karma accumulation. For such a one (*jāgarato*, "the watchful/awakened"), fear has no basis. There is nothing left to lose or protect.

### Verse 40: The Jar and the Fortress

**Verse 40**

Knowing this body is frail like a jar,  
Establishing the mind like a fortress,  
Fight Māra with wisdom's weapon—  
Guard your success, remain unattached.[8]

#### Footnotes

[8] **Two Metaphors, Two Strategies**: The body (*kāya*) is compared to a *kumbha* (clay jar)—fragile, easily broken, temporary. But the mind (*citta*) can be established like a *nagara* (fortress, citadel)—defensible, protected, strong. The verse prescribes combat: *yodhetha Māraṁ* ("fight Māra") with *paññāvudha* ("wisdom's weapon"). The final injunction—*anivesano siyā* ("remain unattached")—prevents spiritual materialism: don't cling even to your spiritual victories.

### Verse 41: The Body's Fate

**Verse 41**

Before long, alas, this body  
Will lie upon the ground,  
Rejected, without consciousness,  
Like a useless piece of wood.[9]

#### Footnotes

[9] **Memento Mori**: *Aciraṁ* (before long, soon) emphasizes urgency—death approaches everyone. *Chuddho* (rejected, cast aside) and *apetaviññāṇo* (without consciousness, bereft of awareness) describe the corpse. The simile *niratthaṁ va kaliṅgaraṁ* ("like a useless piece of wood") is brutally deflationary—the body we cherish will become garbage. This contemplation, far from morbid, motivates practice: time is limited.

### Verses 42-43: The Mind's Power for Harm and Good

**Verse 42**

Whatever an aggressor does to an aggressor,  
Or an enemy to an enemy—  
A wrongly-directed mind  
Can do far worse than that to him.[10]

**Verse 43**

Not mother, not father,  
Nor any other relative  
Could do as much for him  
As a rightly-directed mind.[11]

#### Footnotes

[10] **Self-Harm Through Mental Misdirection**: External enemies can harm the body, reputation, possessions. But *micchāpaṇihitaṁ cittaṁ* (a wrongly-directed mind) damages something more fundamental—it creates the karma that determines future suffering across lifetimes. The comparison to aggressor and enemy highlights this: no outer foe matches the danger of one's own untrained mind.

[11] **Self-Help Through Mental Alignment**: The parallel structure underscores the mind's positive potential. *Mātā pitā* (mother and father) and *aññe ñātakā* (other relatives) represent those who love and support us most. Yet even their best efforts cannot benefit us as much as *sammāpaṇihitaṁ cittaṁ* (a rightly-directed mind). Liberation—the ultimate benefit—only we can give ourselves through mental training.

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Key Concepts

1. **Citta**: Mind as the trainable factor—not fixed consciousness but malleable process
2. **Mind Similes**: Arrow, fish, bird, fortress, hidden dweller—capturing different aspects
3. **Damatha/Gutta**: Restraint and guarding—active protection of mental states
4. **Micchāpaṇihita/Sammāpaṇihita**: Wrongly-directed vs. rightly-directed mind—the crucial variable
