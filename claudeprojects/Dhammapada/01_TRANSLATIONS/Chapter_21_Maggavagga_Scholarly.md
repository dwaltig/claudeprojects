### Verses 273-276: The Eightfold Path

**Verses 273-276**

The Eightfold is the best of paths;  
Four principles the best of truths;  
Passionlessness the best of states;  
The Visionary the best of beings.

This is THE path—there is no other—  
For insight and purity.  
Enter upon this path;  
This confounds Māra.

Having entered this path,  
You will make an end to suffering.  
The path was declared by me  
For removing the dart through knowledge.

Your duty is ardor—  
The Tathāgatas only point the way.  
Meditators who enter this path  
Are released from Māra's bonds.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **The Path Declared**: *Maggānaṭṭhaṅgiko seṭṭho* (Eightfold Path is best). *Eso va maggo natthañño* (this is THE path, no other). *Tumhehi kiccaṁ ātappaṁ* (your duty is ardor)—the Buddha points; you must walk.

### Verses 277-279: The Three Marks

**Verse 277**

All conditions are impermanent.  
When one sees this with wisdom,  
One grows tired of suffering—  
This is the path to purity.

**Verse 278**

All conditions are suffering.  
When one sees this with wisdom,  
One grows tired of suffering—  
This is the path to purity.

**Verse 279**

All dhammas are without self.  
When one sees this with wisdom,  
One grows tired of suffering—  
This is the path to purity.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **The Three Marks (Ti-lakkhaṇa)**: *Sabbe saṅkhārā aniccā* (all conditions impermanent); *sabbe saṅkhārā dukkhā* (all conditions suffering); *sabbe dhammā anattā* (all dhammas without self). Seeing any one of these deeply leads to *nibbidā* (disenchantment) and purity.

### Verses 280-285: Effort and Cutting Attachment

**Verses 280-282**

The lazy one—youthful, strong but indolent,  
Mind lacking right intention—  
Does not find wisdom's path.

Guarded in speech, well-restrained in mind,  
Not doing wrong with body—  
Purify these three paths of action;  
Undertake the path shown by seers.

From effort arises wisdom;  
Without effort, wisdom is destroyed.  
Understanding these two paths,  
Establish yourself so wisdom grows.

**Verses 283-285**

Cut down the forest, not just a tree—  
From the forest arises danger.  
Having cut forest and thicket,  
Be without forests, monastics.

As long as any atom of desire  
For women is not cut down,  
So long is the mind in bondage—  
Like a calf bound to mother's milk.

Cut off self-affection  
Like an autumn lotus plucked by hand.  
Develop the path to peace—  
Nibbāna taught by the Happy One.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **The Forest Metaphor**: *Vana* (forest) represents defilements. *Kumudaṁ sāradikaṁ va* (like autumn lotus)—cut self-affection cleanly. *Santimaggam-eva brūhaya* (develop the path to peace).

### Verses 286-289: Death Comes Like a Flood

**Verses 286-289**

"Here I'll stay for the rains;  
Here for winter and summer"—  
So thinks the fool,  
Not understanding the danger.

The person attached to children and cattle,  
Mind besotted—  
Is snatched by death  
Like a sleeping village by flood.

Children are not refuge;  
Nor father nor kin.  
For one overcome by the End-Maker,  
There is no refuge in relatives.

Understanding this truth,  
The wise one endowed with virtue  
Should quickly purify the path  
Leading to Nibbāna.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **No Refuge in Family**: *Na santi puttā tāṇāya* (children are not refuge)—at death, no relative can help. *Antakena* (the End-Maker)—death. *Khippam-eva visodhaye* (quickly purify)—urgency.
