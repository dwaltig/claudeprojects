# Chapter 23: Nāgavagga - Blues Edition
## The Elephant: Noble in Strength, Noble in Training

---

## Opening Words

The elephant was the mightiest animal in ancient India—patient, powerful, wise. The Buddha loved this image. He called himself "the elephant" in his final days. This chapter teaches you to BE the elephant: endure abuse like an arrow in battle, train yourself like the royal tusker, and when no good companion can be found—walk alone through the forest like the solitary bull.

### Verses 320-321: Endure Abuse Like an Elephant in Battle

**The Blues Truth:**

Like an ELEPHANT in battle  
Endures an arrow shot from the bow—  
That's how I will endure abuse.

Why?  
Because many people are unvirtuous.  
That's just how it is.  
They're gonna talk.  
They're gonna hate.  
They're gonna shoot their arrows.

But the TRAINED one—  
That's who they lead into crowds.  
That's who kings mount.  
The trained one is BEST among humans—  
The one who can endure.

Arrows of words flying?  
Stand like the elephant.  
Let them fall.  
Keep moving.

**Blues Notes:** *Nāgo va saṅgāme*—like an elephant in battle. War elephants were trained to endure arrows without panic. The Buddha's saying: train your mind to endure abuse the same way.

### Verses 322-323: Self-Training Is the Noblest

**The Blues Truth:**

Noble are the well-trained horses.  
Noble are the well-bred steeds from Sindh.  
Noble are the great tusker elephants.

But MORE noble than all of these?  
The one who has TRAINED THEMSELVES.

You can't ride a horse to Nibbāna.  
You can't travel by elephant  
To the place beyond all destinations.

But through training YOURSELF well—  
Being trained by the training—  
THAT'S how you get there.

No vehicle takes you.  
Only the trained mind arrives.

**Blues Notes:** *Attadanto tato varaṁ*—more noble is the self-trained. The Buddha's comparing the HIGHEST achievements in animal training to self-training—and saying self-training wins.

### Verse 324: Dhanapālaka Remembers the Forest

**The Blues Truth:**

There was a tusker named DHANAPĀLAKA—  
"Guardian of Wealth."  
Captured, musty in rut,  
Difficult to restrain.

They bound him up.  
Gave him food.  
But he wouldn't eat a MORSEL.

Why?

He remembered the elephant forest.  
He remembered where he came from.  
He remembered FREEDOM.

That's what kept him going—  
The memory of the wild,  
The longing for home.

Do YOU remember where freedom lives?  
Do YOU remember what you're really after?  
Let that memory sustain you,  
Even when you're bound.

**Blues Notes:** *Sumarati nāgavanassa kuñjaro*—the tusker remembers the elephant forest. This is a teaching story about not forgetting your true home—Nibbāna—even when caught in the bonds of worldly life.

### Verse 325: Don't Be the Pig

**The Blues Truth:**

When you're TORPID—  
When you overeat—  
When you're sleepy, rolling around in bed—

You're like a great PIG  
Fed on fodder.  
Stuffed and stupid.

And that fool?  
That dull, lazy fool?  
Comes to the WOMB again.  
Rebirth after rebirth.

Is that what you want?  
To be born again  
'Cause you couldn't stay awake?

Wake UP.  
Stop eating like a pig.  
Stop sleeping your life away.

**Blues Notes:** *Mahāvarāho va nivāpapuṭṭho*—like a great pig fed on fodder. The contrast with the noble elephant is sharp: the elephant remembers freedom; the pig just eats and sleeps into rebirth.

### Verse 326: Control the Mind Like an Elephant with a Goad

**The Blues Truth:**

BEFORE—  
This wandering mind wandered everywhere.  
Through desire. Through pleasure. Through whatever it wanted.  
It went where IT wanted to go.

But TODAY—  
I will control it WISELY.  
Like the one with a GOAD  
Controls an elephant in rut.

That elephant is wild.  
Dangerous. Unpredictable.  
But with skill and a goad,  
You can direct it.

Same with your mind.  
It's been running wild.  
Time to take the goad in hand.

**Blues Notes:** *Hatthim-pabhinnaṁ viya aṅkusaggaho*—like one with goad (controls) an elephant in rut. The aṅkusa is the elephant goad. This verse is about the TURNING point when you decide to train your mind.

### Verse 327: Raise Yourself from the Pit

**The Blues Truth:**

Delight in HEEDFULNESS.  
Protect your MIND.  
ALWAYS.

You're stuck in a pit right now—  
Like a tusker sunk in the mud.  
Struggling. Stuck.

But even the elephant can pull itself free.  
It RAISES itself from the muck.

You can too.  
Pull yourself up.  
Out of the pit.  
Out of the swamp.  
Into freedom.

**Blues Notes:** *Paṅke sanno va kuñjaro*—like a tusker sunk in the mud. Elephants actually do get stuck in swamps, and they have to heave themselves out with massive effort. That's YOUR job with your mind.

### Verses 328-330: On Friendship and Solitude

**The Blues Truth:**

IF you find a PRUDENT friend—  
One who lives well, who's wise—  
STAY with that one.  
Walk together.  
Overcome your troubles together.  
Be glad. Be mindful.

BUT—  
If you DON'T find such a friend?  
If no one lives well around you?

Then be like a KING  
Who abandons his conquered kingdom.  
Walk ALONE.  
Like a solitary elephant in the forest.

BETTER to live alone  
Than be friends with a fool.  
Live alone. Do nothing bad.  
Unconcerned. Free.  
Like the bull elephant  
Who needs no herd.

It's better to walk alone  
Than walk wrong with company.

**Blues Notes:** *Eko care mātaṅgaraññe va nāgo*—one should live alone like a solitary elephant in the forest. This repeats twice—the Buddha MEANT it. Bad company isn't worth having.

### Verse 331: What Is Good

**The Blues Truth:**

Friends are GOOD when need arises.  
Being content with whatever? GOOD.  
Merit at the end of life? GOOD.  
Abandoning all suffering? GOOD.

That's the list.  
Four goods:  
Friends when needed.  
Contentment always.  
Merit at death.  
The end of suffering.

Simple. Clear.  
What's on YOUR list?

---

### Verse 332: Respecting Elders and Teachers

**The Blues Truth:**

RESPECTING your mother is good in this world.  
RESPECTING your father is good in this world.  
RESPECTING ascetics is good in this world.  
RESPECTING true brahmins is good in this world.

Honor those who came before.  
Honor those who teach.  
Honor those who walked the path.

This isn't weakness—  
This is WISDOM.

---

### Verse 333: What's Good Till Old Age

**The Blues Truth:**

VIRTUOUS CONDUCT till old age is good.  
Stay steady your whole life—that's gold.

FAITH well-established is good.  
Root yourself in what's true.

The ACQUISITION of wisdom is good.  
Keep learning, keep growing.

Doing NOTHING wicked is good.  
The simplest teaching, the hardest practice.

Four more goods:  
Virtue all the way through.  
Faith planted deep.  
Wisdom gathered.  
No wickedness done.

That's how you live  
Like an elephant—  
Noble from beginning to end.

**Blues Notes:** *Sukhaṁ yāva jarā sīlaṁ*—virtuous conduct till old age. This is the closing teaching of the chapter: sustain your practice until the very end.
