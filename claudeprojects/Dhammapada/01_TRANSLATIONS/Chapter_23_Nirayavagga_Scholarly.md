# Chapter 22: Nirayavagga (The Underworld)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Nirayavagga

The twenty-second chapter confronts *niraya*—the "downward realm" or hell—with unflinching directness. In Buddhist cosmology, *niraya* represents not eternal damnation but temporary (though agonizingly prolonged) states resulting from unwholesome karma. This chapter catalogs the pathways to such suffering: false speech, hypocritical monasticism, sexual misconduct, wrong views, and moral confusion.

The chapter's pedagogical strategy is deterrence through vivid consequence. These verses functioned in Buddhist culture as moral reminders, often recited to reinforce ethical training. The teaching is not metaphysical speculation about the nature of hell realms but practical psychology: certain actions lead inexorably to certain sufferings.

Notably, several verses (316-318) employ a threefold parallel structure examining how wrong views (*micchā-diṭṭhi*) invert moral perception—making beings ashamed of the shameless, fearful of the harmless, and blind to genuine danger.

### Verse 306: False Speech and Denial

The one who speaks falsely goes to the underworld,
As does one who, having done, says "I did not do."
Both of these, when they have passed on, become just the same—
Humans who did base deeds in the hereafter.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Abhūtavādī**: One who speaks what is not (*abhūta*, "non-existent, false")—the liar. The verse pairs this with the more specific deception: *katvā 'na karomi' ti cāha* ("having done, says 'I do not do'")—denial of one's own actions. Both are *nihīnakamma* (of low/base deeds). The phrase *pecca samā bhavanti* ("having passed on, become the same") emphasizes karmic equality: elaborate deception and simple lying yield identical results. The Pali *upeti* (goes toward) suggests movement toward *niraya* as natural consequence, not divine punishment.

### Verse 307: The Unworthy Robe-Wearer

Many wearing the monastic robe around their necks
Are wicked and unrestrained—
The wicked, through their wicked deeds,
Re-arise in the underworld.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **Kāsāvakaṇṭhā**: Literally "ochre-robe-necked"—those who wear the monastic *kāsāva* (saffron/ochre robe). *Pāpadhammā* (wicked in nature) and *asaññatā* (unrestrained) describes the hypocrite: outer signs of renunciation, inner continuation of unwholesome states. *Upapajjare* (re-arise, are reborn) in *niraya* follows naturally from *pāpehi kammehi* (through wicked deeds). This verse recalls Chapter 1's teaching (verses 9-10) that the robe has meaning only when matched by inner transformation.

### Verse 308: The Iron Ball

It is better to have swallowed a glowing iron ball,
Like a flame of fire,
Than that a monk—unvirtuous and unrestrained—
Should enjoy the country's almsfood.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Ayoguḷo Bhutto**: The *ayoguḷa* (iron ball) *tatta* (heated, glowing) *aggisikhūpamo* (flame-like) represents extreme physical torment. Yet such suffering, the verse claims, is *seyya* (better) than the karmic consequence of a *dussīla* (unvirtuous) and *asaññata* (unrestrained) monastic consuming *raṭṭhapiṇḍa* (the country's almsfood—offerings from the faithful). The hyperbole is shocking: physical agony is preferable to the spiritual destruction of exploiting religious generosity. This verse influenced later Buddhist reform movements concerned with monastic discipline.

### Verses 309-310: Four Consequences of Adultery

**Verse 309**

There are four states the heedless man
Who consorts with another's wife undergoes:
Gaining demerit, an uncomfortable bed,
Blame as third, and the underworld as fourth.[4]

**Verse 310**

Gaining demerit and a bad destiny,
The small delight of a scared man with a scared woman,
And heavy punishment from kings—
Therefore one should not consort with another's wife.[5]

#### Footnotes

[4] **Cattāri Ṭhānāni**: Four *ṭhāna* (states, conditions) befall the *pamatta* (heedless) *paradārūpasevī* (one who approaches another's wife): (1) *apuññalābha* (gaining demerit—negative karma); (2) *nanikāmaseyya* (uncomfortable bed—disturbed sleep from guilt/fear); (3) *nindā* (blame, censure—social consequences); (4) *niraya* (the underworld—karmic destination). This progression moves from immediate psychological consequence through social penalty to ultimate cosmic result.

[5] **Bhītassa Bhītāya**: The phrase captures the anxiety pervading illicit relations—*bhīta* (frightened, scared) characterizes both parties. Their *ratī* (pleasure, delight) is *thokikā* (small, trifling). The *rāja* (king) applies *daṇḍa* (punishment) *garuka* (heavy, weighty). The verse concludes with practical advice: *tasmā* (therefore) *na seve* (one should not resort to). Buddhist ethics here aligns with social order—adultery harms self, partners, families, and society.

### Verse 311: The Jagged Grass

As jagged grass, wrongly grasped, cuts into the hand,
So does the monastic life, wrongly grasped,
Drag one down to the underworld.[6]

#### Footnotes

[6] **Kuso Yathā Duggahito**: *Kusa* grass has sharp edges that cut when grasped improperly. *Sāmañña* (the monastic life, asceticism) similarly *dupparāmaṭṭha* (wrongly handled, badly grasped) doesn't merely fail to help—it actively *upakaḍḍhati* (drags down) to *niraya*. The metaphor is precise: just as the same grass provides material for religious ceremonies when properly handled but injures when grasped carelessly, the monastic life can either liberate or condemn depending on how it's approached.

### Verses 312-313: Lax Practice

**Verse 312**

Whatever lax deed there is, and whatever vow is defiled,
A holy life that is doubtful—
This does not produce great fruit.[7]

**Verse 313**

If one would do what should be done,
One should be firm in that effort.
For the wanderer who is lax
Spreads much impurity.[8]

#### Footnotes

[7] **Sithilaṁ Kammaṁ**: *Sithila* means lax, loose, slack—opposite of disciplined. Combined with *saṅkiliṭṭha* (defiled) *vata* (vow, observance) and *saṅkassara* (doubtful, suspicious) *brahmacariya* (holy life), the result is *na mahapphala* (not of great fruit). Half-hearted practice yields meager results. The Buddhist path requires *viriya* (energy, effort)—mere going-through-the-motions accomplishes little.

[8] **Daḷham-enaṁ Parakkame**: *Daḷha* (firm, strong) effort is required. The *paribbāja* (wanderer, renunciant) who is *sathila* (lax, slack) *ākirate* (scatters, spreads) *raja* (dust, impurity)—polluting themselves and potentially others. The image suggests contamination: spiritual laxity doesn't remain contained but spreads pollution. This provides motivation for diligent practice.

### Verse 314: Better Undone Than Wrong-Done

Better undone is a wrong-doing,
For a wrong-doing one later regrets.
Better done is what is well-done,
Which, when done, one does not regret.[9]

#### Footnotes

[9] **Akataṁ Dukkataṁ Seyyo**: The verse establishes a hierarchy: *dukkataṁ* (wrong-doing, ill-done) is *seyya* (better) when *akataṁ* (undone)—one should abstain. *Pacchā tapati* ("later burns, regrets")—wrong action produces subsequent remorse. Conversely, *sukataṁ* (well-done) is better *kataṁ* (when done), since it produces *nānutappati* (no regret, no burning). The verse uses *tappati* (burns) to connect regret with the burning (*tapa*) torment of *niraya* itself—present psychological "burning" foreshadows potential cosmic burning.

### Verse 315: Guard Like a Border Town

As a border town is guarded within and without,
So should one guard oneself.
Let not the moment pass—
For when opportunity has passed, they grieve
Who are consigned to the underworld.[10]

#### Footnotes

[10] **Nagaraṁ Paccantaṁ**: A frontier city (*paccantaṁ nagaraṁ*) requires vigilance on all sides—*santarabāhiraṁ* (inside and outside). Similarly, one must *gopetha* (guard, watch over) *attānaṁ* (oneself). The urgency intensifies: *khaṇo vo mā upaccagā* ("let not the moment/opportunity pass you by"). *Khaṇātītā* (those whose moment has passed) *socanti* (grieve) when *samappitā* (consigned, established) in *niraya*. The verse emphasizes temporal urgency—opportunity for practice is fleeting; hell is for those who let it slip away.

### Verses 316-318: The Threefold Inversion of Wrong Views

These three verses share identical structure, each showing how *micchā-diṭṭhi* (wrong view) inverts proper perception.

**Verse 316: Shame Inverted**

They are ashamed of what is not shameful,
Not ashamed of what is shameful—
Undertaking wrong views,
Beings go to a bad destiny.[11]

**Verse 317: Fear Inverted**

Seeing fear in what is not fearful,
Not seeing fear in what is fearful—
Undertaking wrong views,
Beings go to a bad destiny.[12]

**Verse 318: Blame Inverted**

Finding fault in what is faultless,
Not seeing fault in what is faulty—
Undertaking wrong views,
Beings go to a bad destiny.[13]

#### Footnotes

[11] **Alajjitāye Lajjanti**: *Lajjā* (shame, moral conscience) properly applied is a protective factor. But those with inverted views feel shame (*lajjanti*) regarding what requires none (*alajjitāya*) while feeling none (*na lajjare*) where shame is appropriate (*lajjitāya*). Such beings *samādāna* (undertake, take up) *micchā-diṭṭhi* (wrong view)—their fundamental orientation is distorted. They go to *duggati* (bad destination, unfortunate rebirth).

[12] **Abhaye Bhayadassino**: Fear (*bhaya*) likewise becomes inverted. Those with wrong views see fear (*bhayadassino*) in harmless things (*abhaye*) while seeing no fear (*ābhayadassino*) in genuinely dangerous things (*bhaye*). This describes both specific cases (fearing the harmless, ignoring real threats) and the fundamental spiritual error of fearing liberation while embracing suffering.

[13] **Avajje Vajjamatino**: *Vajja* (fault, blame) requires correct perception. Finding fault (*vajjamatino*) in the faultless (*avajje*) and seeing none (*avajjadassino*) in the genuinely faulty (*vajje*) represents moral blindness. The three verses (316-318) together show how wrong view corrupts the three protective mental factors: shame (*hiri*), fear of wrongdoing (*ottappa*), and discernment of blame.

### Verse 319: Right Views and Good Destiny

Knowing blame in what is blameworthy,
And no blame in what is blameless,
Undertaking right views,
Beings go to a good destiny.[14]

#### Footnotes

[14] **Sammādiṭṭhisamādānā**: This verse reverses the pattern—*sammā-diṭṭhi* (right view) enables *ñatvā* (knowing, recognizing) *vajja* (blame) in what is blameworthy (*vajjato*) and its absence (*avajja*) in what is blameless (*avajjato*). Such beings go to *suggati* (good destination, fortunate rebirth). The chapter thus closes not with damnation but with the alternative: right view leads to good outcomes. The pathway to *niraya* can be avoided through correct understanding.

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Key Concepts

1. **Niraya**: The "downward realm," hell—not eternal but temporary karmic consequence
2. **Micchā-diṭṭhi**: Wrong view—the root distortion that inverts moral perception
3. **Khaṇa**: The opportune moment—urgency of practice before opportunity passes
4. **Moral Inversion**: Shame, fear, and blame-perception corrupted by wrong views
5. **Hypocrisy's Cost**: The special danger of external religion without internal transformation

### Cross-References

- **Majjhima Nikāya 41**: Sāleyyaka Sutta details actions leading to *niraya*
- **Anguttara Nikāya 3.36**: Three causes of downfall parallel this chapter's concerns
- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 3**: Burning House parable similarly uses vivid imagery to motivate liberation
- **Tibetan Wheel of Life**: Visual depictions of hell realms elaborate themes here

### Historical Context

Buddhist cosmology developed elaborate descriptions of hell realms (*niraya*), including hot and cold hells with specific torments. This chapter predates such elaboration, presenting *niraya* more as inevitable consequence than detailed geography. The emphasis on hypocrisy (verses 307-308) reflects concerns about monastic authenticity that recur throughout Buddhist history.
