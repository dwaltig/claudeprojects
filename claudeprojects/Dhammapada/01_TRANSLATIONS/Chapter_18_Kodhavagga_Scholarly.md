# Chapter 17: Kodhavagga (Anger)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Kodhavagga

The seventeenth chapter addresses *kodha* (anger)—its abandonment, its antidotes, and the famous teaching that no one in the world is entirely blameless or praiseworthy. The charioteer metaphor and the three gates (body, speech, mind) teaching are central.

### Verses 221-223: Abandoning Anger

**Verse 221**

Abandon anger, abandon conceit,  
Overcome every fetter.  
Without clinging to mind and body,  
Sufferings never befall the one without possessions.

**Verse 222**

Whoever holds back arisen anger  
Like controlling a swerving chariot—  
That one I call a charioteer.  
Others are merely rein-holders.

**Verse 223**

Through non-anger, overcome anger.  
Through goodness, overcome bad.  
Through giving, overcome stinginess.  
Through truth, overcome lying.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **The Charioteer Metaphor**: *Rathaṁ bhantaṁ va dhāraye* (like controlling a swerving chariot)—anger is like a runaway vehicle. Only one who controls it deserves the title *sārathi* (charioteer). The four antidotes (*akkodhena, sādhunā, dānena, saccena*) show conquering opposites with opposites.

### Verses 224-226: Truth, Gentleness, Liberation

**Verse 224**

Speak truth. Don't get angry.  
Give when asked, even a little.  
Through these three conditions,  
One can go to the presence of the gods.

**Verses 225-226**

Those sages without violence,  
Constantly restrained in body,  
Go to the deathless state—  
Having gone there, they grieve not.

For those always wakeful,  
Training day and night,  
Intent on Nibbāna—  
The pollutants are laid to rest.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **Three Practices, One Goal**: *Saccaṁ, na kujjheyya, dajjā* (truth, non-anger, giving). *Ahiṁsakā* (non-violent) sages reach *accutaṁ ṭhānaṁ* (the deathless state). *Sadā jāgaramānānaṁ* (always wakeful) leads to *āsavā atthaṁ gacchanti* (pollutants laid to rest).

### Verses 227-230: No One Escapes Blame

**Verses 227-228**

This is something ancient, Atula—not just today:  
They blame the silent one; they blame the talkative;  
They blame the moderate speaker.  
No one in the world goes unblamed.

There never was, nor will there be,  
Nor is there found at present,  
A person totally blameworthy  
Or one totally praiseworthy.

**Verses 229-230**

One whom the wise praise after daily examination—  
Faultless in conduct, sagacious, endowed with wisdom and virtue—  
Like a golden coin, who is worthy to blame that one?  
Even gods praise them; even Brahmā praises them.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **The Atula Teaching**: *Natthi loke anindito* (no one in the world is unblamed)—a famous teaching spoken to a lay disciple named Atula. Don't seek universal approval; it doesn't exist. But one like a *nekkhaṁ jambonadassa* (gold coin of finest quality) gains the praise that matters—from the wise and gods.

### Verses 231-234: Three Gates of Restraint

**Verses 231-233**

Guard against bodily anger; be restrained in body.  
Abandoning wrong bodily conduct, practice good bodily conduct.

Guard against verbal anger; be restrained in speech.  
Abandoning wrong verbal conduct, practice good verbal conduct.

Guard against mental anger; be restrained in mind.  
Abandoning wrong mental conduct, practice good mental conduct.

**Verse 234**

The wise are restrained in body,  
Then restrained in speech,  
Then restrained in mind—  
They are indeed fully restrained.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **The Three Doors**: *Kāya, vācā, mano* (body, speech, mind)—the three channels through which anger expresses. *Pakopaṁ rakkheyya* (guard against anger) in each. *Suparisaṁvutā* (fully restrained)—complete self-mastery.
