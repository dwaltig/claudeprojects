# Chapter 3: Cittavagga - Blues Edition
## The Mind: Training the Wildest Thing You Own

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

Your mind. It's the wildest horse you ever tried to ride. Faster than thought—well, it IS thought. Slipperier than water. Can't see it, can't touch it, but it runs your whole life. 

These eleven verses are about one thing: train your mind, or it'll run you into the ground. Point it right, you got the best friend you could ever have. Point it wrong, you got your worst enemy living right inside your skull.

### Verses 33-34: The Mind Like a Fish, Like an Arrow

**The Blues Truth:**

Your mind, your mind—  
It's shaking, it's twitching.  
Your mind, your mind—  
Can't guard it, can't hold it.

But the wise one straightens that mind,  
Straightens it slow and true,  
Like a fletcher straightening an arrow,  
Patient, skilled, seeing it through.

Your mind's like a fish thrown on dry land,  
Flopping, gasping, wild with fear—  
That's what happens when you pull it from distraction,  
That's the panic when you try to train it here.

But that's exactly why you train it,  
That's exactly why you try—  
Use the panic to throw off Māra,  
Learn to straighten, not to die.

**Blues Notes:** The Pali uses two vivid images: *usukāro va tejanaṁ* (like a fletcher with an arrow) and *vārijo va thale khitto* (like a fish thrown on land). The mind resists training—it *panics* when removed from its habitual distractions. But that very agitation can motivate liberation.

### Verses 35-36: Guard What You Can't See

**The Blues Truth:**

Hard to tame, hard to tame,  
Flits wherever it wants.  
Hard to tame, hard to tame,  
Restraint is good—restraint brings peace.

Hard to see, hard to see,  
Subtle as smoke in the dark.  
Hard to see, hard to see,  
Guard it well—guarding brings peace.

A restrained mind brings happiness.  
A guarded mind brings happiness.  
Don't let it run wild—  
Chain it with kindness,  
Leash it with love.

**Blues Notes:** The parallel structure of verses 35-36 in Pali (*dunniggahassa...cittassa damatho sādhu* / *sududdasaṁ sunipuṇaṁ...cittaṁ rakkhetha*) creates a rhythmic pairing: restraint (damatha) and guarding (gutta) both lead to happiness (sukhāvaha). The repetition emphasizes: same teaching, same result.

### Verse 37: The Mind That Roams Far

**The Blues Truth:**

It roams far, roams alone,  
Has no body, hides in a cave.  
It roams far, roams alone—  
But those who restrain it get free.

Can't see it, can't touch it,  
But it runs your whole life.  
Can't see it, can't touch it—  
Tame it and cut loose from strife.

Māra's bonds—Māra's bonds—  
Those who tame mind break free.  
Māra's bonds—Māra's bonds—  
That's the only way to be free.

**Blues Notes:** Four qualities of mind: *dūraṅgama* (far-roaming), *ekacara* (wandering alone), *asarīra* (bodiless), *guhāsaya* (hidden in a cave—the heart). This invisible, elusive thing determines everything. The verse promises: *mokkhanti Mārabandhanā*—they gain release from Māra's bonds.

### Verses 38-39: Unsettled and Settled

**The Blues Truth:**

Unsettled mind, unsettled mind,  
Doesn't know the True Teaching.  
Unsettled mind, unsettled mind,  
Confidence wavers, wisdom never fills up.

BUT—

Free from lust, free from confusion,  
Abandoned both merit and sin.  
Free from lust, free from confusion,  
For the wakeful—no fear. Not within.

Nothing left to lose,  
Nothing left to protect.  
When you've let go of everything,  
What is there left to deflect?

**Blues Notes:** The contrast couldn't be starker. Verse 38: *anavaṭṭhitacitta* (unsettled mind) → unfulfilled wisdom. Verse 39: *anavassutacitta* (mind free from lust) → no fear. *Puññapāpapahīnassa* (having abandoned merit and demerit) describes the arahat—beyond karma accumulation entirely.

### Verse 40: The Jar and the Fortress

**The Blues Truth:**

Your body, your body—  
Fragile like a clay pot.  
Drop it and it shatters.  
That's what you got.

Your mind, your mind—  
Build it like a fortress.  
Stone walls and strong gates.  
Nothing gets past this.

Fight Māra with wisdom,  
That's the only weapon that works.  
Guard what you've won—  
But don't cling to the perks.

Win the battle,  
Then let go of the win.  
That's the way, that's the way—  
That's how you begin.

**Blues Notes:** *Kumbhūpama* (like a jar) for body; *nagarūpama* (like a fortress) for mind. The body's fragility contrasts with the mind's potential strength. *Paññāvudhena* (with wisdom's weapon)—the only thing that actually defeats Māra. *Anivesano siyā* (remain unattached)—don't cling even to your spiritual victories.

### Verse 41: The Body's Fate

**The Blues Truth:**

Soon, soon, this body  
Will lie on the ground.  
Soon, soon, this body  
Will lie there without sound.

Rejected, abandoned,  
No consciousness inside.  
Just a useless piece of wood—  
That's what happens when you've died.

So what are you waiting for?  
What are you waiting for?  
Train your mind NOW—  
Before it lies on the floor.

**Blues Notes:** *Aciraṁ* (before long, soon) creates urgency. *Chuddho apetaviññāṇo* (rejected, without consciousness)—the corpse is explicitly compared to *niratthaṁ va kaliṅgaraṁ* (a useless piece of wood). This isn't morbid—it's motivation. Time is running out.

### Verses 42-43: Your Worst Enemy, Your Best Friend

**The Blues Truth:**

What an enemy does to an enemy,  
What an aggressor does to a foe—  
A wrongly-directed mind  
Does worse to you than they'll ever know.

Your mind turned against you,  
Your mind pointed wrong—  
Worse than any enemy,  
Hurts you deep and long.

BUT—

What your mama couldn't do for you,  
What your daddy couldn't give,  
What no relative could offer—  
A rightly-directed mind helps you live.

Your mind turned toward you,  
Your mind pointed right—  
Better than any gift,  
Better than any light.

Point it right, point it right,  
Better than any kin.  
Point it wrong, point it wrong,  
Worse than any sin.

**Blues Notes:** The closing twin verses summarize the chapter: *micchāpaṇihita citta* (wrongly-directed mind) is your worst enemy; *sammāpaṇihita citta* (rightly-directed mind) is your best friend—better than what even your mother and father could do for you. Liberation only YOU can give yourself.

## End of Chapter 3: The Mind

**What We Learned:**

1. Your mind's wild—train it like a fletcher trains an arrow
2. It panics when you start training—like a fish on dry land
3. Restraint is good, guarding is good—both bring happiness
4. It roams far, hides in a cave—but tame it and break free
5. Unsettled mind = unfulfilled wisdom
6. Settled mind = no fear, nothing left to lose
7. Body fragile like a jar—mind strong like a fortress
8. Fight Māra with wisdom, then let go of the victory
9. Soon this body will be useless wood—train the mind NOW
10. Wrongly-directed mind is your worst enemy
11. Rightly-directed mind is your best friend—better than mama or daddy ever could be

Your mind, your mind—  
Train it or be trained BY it.  
Point it right or suffer wrong.  
That's the whole chapter's song.

**Blues Notes on Translation Method:**

The mind chapter demanded imagery that captures both wildness and trainability. The Blues knows this territory—every Blues singer has wrestled with their own mind, faced demons inside their own skull, learned to direct thought toward freedom instead of destruction. The Buddha and the Blues agree: your mind is either your best friend or your worst enemy. YOU decide which by how you train it.
