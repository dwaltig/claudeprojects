## Fools: Your Own Worst Enemy

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

Fools. The Buddha's got a lot to say about 'em. Not stupid people—people who refuse to learn. People who make the same mistakes over and over. People who carry their worst enemy inside their own skull. This chapter holds up a mirror. Don't flinch if you see yourself.

### Verse 60: Long is the Night

**The Blues Truth:**

Long is the night, long is the night  
When you can't find sleep.  
Long is the road, long is the road  
When your body's weak.

But longer still, LONGER STILL  
Is the wheel of birth and death  
For fools who won't learn Dhamma,  
Won't learn it with their last breath.

Long for the sleepless.  
Longer for the tired.  
Longest for the fools  
Who never get it right.

**Blues Notes:** *Dīgha* (long) repeats three times with increasing stakes: sleepless night → exhausting journey → endless rebirths. The fool's suffering extends because they refuse the teaching that would end it.

### Verse 61: Walk Alone If You Must

**The Blues Truth:**

If you can't find someone better,  
If you can't find someone the same,  
Walk alone, walk alone—  
There's no friendship in a fool's game.

Better lonely, better lonely  
Than bad company.  
Better lonely, better lonely  
Than dragging down your destiny.

No friendship with fools.  
No friendship with fools.  
Walk alone if you must—  
That's the wise one's rules.

**Blues Notes:** *Ekacariyaṁ daḷhaṁ kayirā* (firmly resolve to go alone). Better solitude than corrupting companionship. Bad companions drag you down faster than you can lift them up.

### Verse 62: Nothing Is Yours

**The Blues Truth:**

"Sons are mine! Riches are mine!"  
So the fool worries and frets.  
"Sons are mine! Riches are mine!"  
Piling up phantom debts.

But if your SELF ain't even yours—  
And friend, it ain't, it ain't—  
How can sons be? How can gold be?  
Nothing's yours beyond the paint.

Nothing's yours, nothing's yours,  
Not even the one who's grabbing.  
Nothing's yours, nothing's yours—  
Stop all that grabbing.

**Blues Notes:** *Attā hi attano natthi* (even self is not one's own). If the "I" that supposedly owns things is impermanent and ownerless, what can truly belong to it? The fool's vexation comes from claiming what cannot be claimed.

### Verse 63: The Wise Fool

**The Blues Truth:**

A fool who knows he's foolish—  
At least he's got that right.  
A fool who knows he's foolish—  
Got a little spark of light.

But a fool proud of his wisdom,  
Thinking he's the smartest one—  
HE'S the fool, the REAL fool,  
Can't learn nothing—he's done.

Know you don't know, know you don't know,  
That's where wisdom starts.  
Think you know it all already—  
That's the foolish heart.

**Blues Notes:** *Paṇḍitamānī* (proud of wisdom, thinking oneself wise) is the real danger. The fool who believes himself wise cannot learn. Knowing you don't know is the beginning of knowledge.

### Verses 64-65: The Spoon and the Tongue

**The Blues Truth:**

A fool can sit with a wise man,  
Sit with him his whole life long—  
Won't learn a drop of Dhamma,  
Like a spoon that can't taste the song.

Spoon in the curry, spoon in the curry,  
Stirs it every day—  
Never tastes a single bite,  
That's the foolish way.

BUT—

A perceptive one sits with a wise man  
For just a moment's time—  
Learns the Dhamma quick as lightning,  
Like the tongue that tastes the rhyme.

Tongue tastes curry, tongue tastes curry,  
First bite and it knows—  
That's the perceptive way,  
That's the way wisdom grows.

**Blues Notes:** *Dabbī sūparasaṁ yathā* (as a spoon the taste of curry). The famous simile: despite constant immersion in wisdom, the fool never absorbs it. Capacity to learn (*viññū*) determines results, not duration of exposure.

### Verse 66: Your Own Enemy

**The Blues Truth:**

Stupid fools walk around  
With their worst enemy inside.  
Stupid fools carry  
What they can't outrun or hide.

Doing wicked deeds, doing wicked deeds,  
Planting bitter fruit.  
Your own hands sow the seeds—  
You're your own enemy at the root.

Enemy inside, enemy inside,  
Doing harm to yourself.  
Nobody hurts you like YOU do  
When you're working against your health.

**Blues Notes:** *Amitteneva attanā* (with themselves as enemy). The fool's tragedy is self-inflicted. Every wicked deed produces bitter fruit—and you're the one planting.

---

### Verses 67-68: Regret and Relief

**The Blues Truth:**

That deed ain't well done, ain't well done,  
That leaves tears on your face.  
That deed ain't well done, ain't well done,  
When the result tracks you down to your place.

BUT—

That deed IS well done, IS well done,  
That leaves peace in your heart.  
That deed IS well done, IS well done,  
When the result's a fresh start.

Tears on your face? Bad deed.  
Peace in your heart? Good.  
That's how you know, that's how you know  
If you did what you should.

**Blues Notes:** Simple test: *anutappati* (regret) marks bad deeds; *nānutappati* (no regret) marks good. Your own heart tells you the truth.

---

### Verse 69: Sweet Until It Ripens

**The Blues Truth:**

The fool thinks it's sweet, thinks it's sweet,  
While the deed is still young.  
The fool thinks it's sweet, thinks it's sweet—  
Hasn't felt where it's heading from.

But when that deed ripens, ripens,  
When it finally comes true—  
The fool suffers, suffers, suffers,  
Bitter after the sweet he knew.

Sweet now. Bitter later.  
Sweet now. Bitter later.  
That's the karma of the fool  
Who couldn't see what would come to his table.

**Blues Notes:** *Madhuvā maññati* (thinks it sweet). Evil feels pleasurable before results manifest. The initial sweetness is deceptive; the fool doesn't see the bitterness coming.

---

### Verse 70: Fasting Without Understanding

**The Blues Truth:**

Month after month the fool may fast,  
Eat barely more than air—  
But he ain't worth a sixteenth part  
Of those who really understand there.

Starving body, empty mind,  
Discipline without the knowing—  
Count for nothing, count for nothing,  
All that pain with nowhere going.

**Blues Notes:** *Kusaggena* (with the tip of kusa grass) refers to extreme fasting. But *saṅkhātadhamma* (those who understand Dhamma) are worth sixteen times more. Asceticism without insight achieves nothing.

---

### Verse 71: Fire Under Ashes

**The Blues Truth:**

A wicked deed don't show right away,  
Like milk don't curdle fast.  
A wicked deed burns slow and hidden,  
Like fire under ash.

Smoldering, smoldering,  
Following the fool.  
Fire under ashes, fire under ashes—  
Burning like a hidden fuel.

Covered up but burning,  
Covered up but hot.  
That's your karma waiting, waiting—  
Ready or not.

**Blues Notes:** *Bhasmacchanno va pāvako* (fire covered with ashes). Karma's delayed action—evil seems dormant but is slowly ripening, quietly burning, waiting to consume. The fool doesn't see the smoke.

---

### Verse 72: Learning That Destroys

**The Blues Truth:**

A fool gains learning, gains learning,  
But it only does him harm.  
A fool gains learning, gains learning,  
Turns knowledge to a gun on his arm.

Destroys his good fortune,  
Destroys his very head.  
Learning in the wrong hands—  
Better ignorant instead.

**Blues Notes:** *Ñattaṁ* (learning) in wrong hands becomes destructive. Misused knowledge is worse than ignorance.

---

### Verses 73-74: The Fool's Ambitions

**The Blues Truth:**

"Let them respect me, respect me,  
Though I haven't earned it yet.  
Let them bow to me, bow to me,  
Let me be the one to get.

Control in the quarters,  
Worship from the crowd—  
'Everything was done by ME!'  
The fool thinks out loud."

Desires grow, conceit grows,  
While he plays the holy game.  
Desires grow, conceit grows—  
Foolishness dressed up in fame.

**Blues Notes:** Spiritual materialism exposed. *Icchā māno ca vaḍḍhati* (desires and conceit increase)—the opposite of genuine progress. Ambition wearing religious clothing.

---

### Verse 75: Two Different Roads

**The Blues Truth:**

The road to gains is one road.  
The road to Nibbāna's another.  
The road to gains is one road—  
They ain't even sisters or brothers.

Don't delight in honors, honors,  
Don't crave the clapping hands.  
Cultivate solitude, solitude—  
That's where freedom stands.

Two roads, two roads,  
Pointing different ways.  
Choose the one to freedom—  
Not the one that pays.

**Blues Notes:** *Lābhūpanisā* (means to gains) versus *Nibbānagāminī* (path to Nibbāna). Two entirely different directions. The Buddha's disciple chooses solitude over prestige.

## End of Chapter 5: Fools

**What We Learned:**

1. Long the night for the sleepless; longer the rebirths for fools
2. Better walk alone than with fools
3. Nothing is yours—not even you
4. Knowing you're a fool is the start of wisdom
5. Spoon never tastes curry; fool never learns Dhamma
6. You're your own worst enemy
7. Good deeds leave peace; bad deeds leave tears
8. Sweet now, bitter later—that's karma
9. Fasting without understanding = nothing
10. Karma smolders like fire under ashes
11. Learning can destroy the fool
12. Ambition dressed in robes is still just ambition
13. Two roads: gains and liberation. Choose.

Fool, fool—  
Don't be one.  
Learn from the teaching,  
Before day is done.

**Blues Notes on Translation Method:**

The Blues knows fools. Every blues song has one—usually the singer. But the Blues also knows the difference between being a fool and staying a fool. The Buddha's chapter isn't mocking fools; it's warning them. And the warning is: your worst enemy is in the mirror. Stop fighting yourself. Learn the taste of the curry. Let go of what was never yours.
