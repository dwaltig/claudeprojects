# Chapter 24: Taṇhāvagga - Blues Edition
## Craving: The Root That Keeps Growing Back

---

## Opening Words

This is THE chapter on craving. *Taṇhā*—that thirst, that hunger, that relentless wanting. The Buddha said craving is the cause of suffering. Cut the root, and the tree can't grow back. But leave even a scrap of root in the ground, and it'll sprout again. Twenty-six verses on the most important thing to understand: what binds you, and how to get free.

### Verses 334-335: Craving Grows Like a Creeper

**The Blues Truth:**

For a human who lives HEEDLESSLY,  
Craving grows like a clinging vine—  
That *māluvā* creeper  
That wraps around and chokes trees.

He rushes from HERE to THERE,  
Like a monkey swinging through the forest,  
Looking for fruit, looking for fruit,  
Never satisfied.

And when this LOW craving,  
This attachment to the world,  
Overcomes you?  
Your GRIEFS increase—  
Like grass after heavy rain,  
Growing wild and thick.

**Blues Notes:** *Taṇhā vaḍḍhati māluvā viya*—craving grows like the māluvā creeper. This vine literally strangles the host tree. Perfect metaphor.

### Verse 336: Overcome Craving, and Grief Falls Away

**The Blues Truth:**

But WHOEVER overcomes  
This low craving—  
Difficult as it is to get past—

Griefs FALL from them  
Like a drop of water  
Off a lotus leaf.

Doesn't stick.  
Doesn't soak in.  
Just rolls right off.

That's what freedom looks like.  
Griefs can't get purchase  
When craving's been cut.

---

### Verse 337: Dig Up the Root

**The Blues Truth:**

This I say to you—  
All of you gathered here:  
GOOD LUCK.

Now DIG UP the root of craving.  
Like a man seeking the fragrant *usīra* root  
Digs up the grass to get to it—  
DIG.

Don't let Māra push you down  
Again and again,  
Like a stream pushes down a reed.  
Stand FIRM.  
Get to the ROOT.

**Blues Notes:** *Taṇhāya mūlaṁ khaṇatha*—dig up craving's root. The *usīra* (vetiver) root is fragrant and valuable. You dig through the grass to get it. Same with liberation—dig through the craving to get to freedom.

---

### Verse 338: The Root That Grows Back

**The Blues Truth:**

You can cut the tree down,  
But if the ROOT stays firm,  
Untroubled,  
It grows AGAIN.

Same with craving.  
When the TENDENCY to craving  
Isn't rooted out,  
This suffering appears  
Again and again and again.

The tree is your behavior.  
The root is the underlying tendency.  
You gotta get the ROOT,  
Or you're just trimming branches forever.

### Verses 339-340: The Thirty-Six Streams

**The Blues Truth:**

In you flow THIRTY-SIX streams—  
Pleasant and strong.  
Six sense doors times three times two:  
Past, present, future—  
Internal, external.

The one with wrong view  
Gets CARRIED AWAY  
By passionate intentions.

Streams are flowing EVERYWHERE.  
Creepers stay where they grow.  
When you SEE this creeper arise,  
Cut its ROOT with wisdom.

Don't just admire the vine.  
Don't just watch the stream.  
CUT. With wisdom.

**Blues Notes:** The thirty-six streams are a technical teaching: six sense bases × (craving for internal objects + craving for external objects) × (past + present + future) = 36 streams of craving.

### Verses 341-343: Crawling Like a Hare in a Trap

**The Blues Truth:**

There are flowing streams  
Of affection and mental happiness—  
We love those streams.

Pleasure-dependent,  
We seek happiness,  
And undergo birth and old age.  
Again. And again.

People surrounded by craving  
CRAWL AROUND  
Like a hare caught in a trap—  
Attached to fetters,  
Clinging tight,  
Coming back to suffering  
For a long, long time.

So REMOVE that craving.  
The monk who longs for dispassion  
Should cut it out.  
Stop crawling.  
Stand up.

**Blues Notes:** *Saso va bādhito*—like a hare in a trap. The image is vivid: not walking, but CRAWLING, unable to escape. That's what craving does to you.

### Verse 344: Free, Yet Running Back to Bondage

**The Blues Truth:**

LOOK at that person—  
Free from desire,  
Intent on solitude,  
Released from the forest of attachment—

Yet RUNNING BACK to the forest.

Come here and SEE that one:  
Though FREE, he runs back to bondage.

Incredible, right?  
Hands untied, yet grabs the chains again.  
Door open, yet walks back to prison.

Don't be that guy.

---

### Verses 345-346: The Real Bonds

**The Blues Truth:**

The wise say  
Iron bonds aren't strong.  
Wooden bonds aren't strong.  
Rope bonds aren't strong.

But IMPASSIONED attachment  
To jewels and earrings,  
To children and wives—  
THAT bondage is strong, say the wise.

It DRAGS you down.  
It's subtle but HARD to escape.

Those who cut THIS bondage  
Wander freely,  
Seeking nothing,  
Abandoning pleasure's happiness.

Cut the REAL bonds—  
Not the visible ones.

---

### Verse 347: The Spider's Web

**The Blues Truth:**

Those impassioned by passion  
Follow the stream—  
Like a SPIDER caught in its own web.

You spin the silk.  
You weave the trap.  
Then you GET CAUGHT  
In what you made yourself.

But the WISE cut through,  
Seeking nothing,  
Abandoning ALL suffering.

Don't spin your own prison.

---

### Verse 348: Be Free of Past, Future, Present

**The Blues Truth:**

Be FREE of the past.  
Be FREE of the future.  
Be FREE of the present.

Cross over ALL existence.  
Mind liberated in EVERY way.

Then you won't return  
To birth and old age.

Three times:  
Past—let go.  
Future—let go.  
Present—let go.

That's the whole thing.

**Blues Notes:** *Muñca pure, muñca pacchato, majjhe muñca*—be free of before, after, and in between. This is one of the most famous verses—complete liberation from temporal clinging.

---

### Verses 349-350: Thoughts, Passion, and Their Antidote

**The Blues Truth:**

For a person CRUSHED by thoughts,  
Pierced by passion,  
Contemplating the attractive—  
Craving increases MORE.  
The bond gets FIRMER.

That's the spiral down.

But whoever DELIGHTS  
In calming thoughts,  
Who MINDFULLY cultivates  
What is UNattractive—  
THAT one abolishes craving.  
THAT one cuts Māra's bond.

Same mind. Different cultivation.  
Different results.

---

### Verses 351-352: The Final Body

**The Blues Truth:**

Having gone to THE END,  
Without trembling,  
Without craving,  
Without impurity,  
Cutting off existence's darts—

This is the FINAL body.  
No more after this.

Without craving, without attachment,  
Skilled in understanding,  
The one in the final body  
Is called a person of GREAT WISDOM.

That's the destination.  
Final stop.

---

### Verse 353: The Buddha's Own Words

**The Blues Truth:**

"ALL-CONQUERING,  
ALL-WISE am I.  
Undefiled regarding all things.

Having given up EVERYTHING,  
Liberated through craving's destruction.

When I have THIS deep knowledge myself—  
Who should I point to as teacher?"

This is the Buddha speaking  
Right after his awakening.  
He found it HIMSELF.  
Now he teaches US.

---

### Verse 354: The Gift That Surpasses All

**The Blues Truth:**

The gift of DHAMMA  
Surpasses all other gifts.

The TASTE of Dhamma  
Surpasses all other tastes.

The LOVE of Dhamma  
Surpasses all other loves.

The DESTRUCTION of craving  
Overcomes all suffering.

Four supremes.  
Remember them.

**Blues Notes:** *Sabbadānaṁ Dhammadānaṁ jināti*—the gift of Dhamma surpasses all gifts. This verse is recited at the end of every Dhamma talk.

---

### Verse 355: Riches Destroy the Stupid

**The Blues Truth:**

Riches DESTROY the stupid one  
Who doesn't seek the way beyond.

Through his craving for riches,  
The stupid one destroys  
OTHERS and HIMSELF.

Wealth ain't the problem.  
CRAVING for wealth is the problem.  
And it takes down everything in its path.

---

### Verses 356-359: The Four Weeds

**The Blues Truth:**

Fields are ruined by WEEDS.  
These people are ruined by PASSION.  
So give to those WITHOUT passion—  
Great fruit from that gift.

Fields are ruined by WEEDS.  
These people are ruined by HATRED.  
So give to those WITHOUT hatred—  
Great fruit from that gift.

Fields are ruined by WEEDS.  
These people are ruined by DELUSION.  
So give to those WITHOUT delusion—  
Great fruit from that gift.

Fields are ruined by WEEDS.  
These people are ruined by DESIRE.  
So give to those WITHOUT desire—  
Great fruit from that gift.

Four weeds:  
Passion. Hatred. Delusion. Desire.  
Find those who've cleared the weeds.  
Support THEM.
