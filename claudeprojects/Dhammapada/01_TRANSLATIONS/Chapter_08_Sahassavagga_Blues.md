# Chapter 8: Sahassavagga - Blues Edition
## Thousands: One Truth Beats a Million Lies

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

A thousand empty words or one truth? A hundred years of wandering or one day of seeing? This chapter puts quantity against quality every single verse. Spoiler: quality wins every time. One word that brings peace beats a thousand that don't. One day seeing clear beats a hundred years blind.

### Verses 100-102: One Word of Truth

**The Blues Truth:**

A thousand sayings, thousand sayings  
Full of useless words—  
Better one word, ONE WORD,  
Hearing it you're brought to peace.

A thousand verses, thousand verses  
Full of empty sound—  
Better one line, ONE LINE,  
That's where peace is found.

Hundred verses, hundred verses  
Full of nothing real—  
Better one verse of Dhamma,  
Hearing it you heal.

One word of truth beats a thousand lies.  
One word of truth beats a thousand lies.  
Don't need the noise—  
Just need what's wise.

**Blues Notes:** *Anatthapadasaṁhitā* (consisting of useless/meaningless words). The criterion is *upasammati* (brought to peace). Quantity means nothing if the words don't pacify the mind.

### Verses 103-105: Conquer Yourself

**The Blues Truth:**

Conquer a thousand men, thousand men,  
A thousand times in war—  
But conquer your OWN self once,  
That's the victory you're living for.

Winning over yourself, over yourself,  
Better than winning over them.  
Winning over yourself, over yourself—  
That victory won't end.

Self-controlled, self-controlled,  
Living well-restrained—  
Neither gods nor demons,  
Not Māra, not Brahmā,  
Can undo what you've gained.

They can't turn victory to defeat,  
They can't turn victory to defeat,  
For the one who conquered SELF,  
That triumph is complete.

**Blues Notes:** *Saṅgāmajuttamo* (supreme in battle) redefines victory. External conquests can always be undone; self-conquest is permanent—even the gods can't reverse it.

### Verses 106-108: Worth More Than a Hundred Years

**The Blues Truth:**

Give a thousand coins, thousand coins,  
Every month for a hundred years—  
Worship someone truly awake  
For just ONE SECOND? That's what clears.

Tend the sacred fire, sacred fire,  
In the forest a hundred years—  
Honor someone truly developed  
For just ONE MOMENT? That's what steers.

All the sacrifices, all the giving,  
All year long seeking merit—  
Doesn't come to a quarter, not a quarter,  
Of honoring someone who's upright in spirit.

**Blues Notes:** *Bhāvitattāna* (one with developed self)—the worthy recipient. *Muhuttam-api* (even for a moment) of genuine worship surpasses a hundred years of undirected generosity.

### Verse 109: Four Things Increase

**The Blues Truth:**

Honor your elders, honor your elders,  
Worship the ones who've walked the way—  
Four things grow, four things grow:

Life grows longer.  
Beauty grows brighter.  
Happiness grows deeper.  
Strength grows stronger.

**Blues Notes:** *Āyu, vaṇṇa, sukha, bala* (life, beauty, happiness, strength). Practical benefits from spiritual practice.

### Verses 110-115: One Day vs. A Hundred Years

**The Blues Truth:**

Live a hundred years, hundred years,  
Without virtue, without calm—  
Better ONE DAY with virtue,  
One day with a meditating palm.

Live a hundred years, hundred years,  
Without wisdom, without peace—  
Better ONE DAY with wisdom,  
One day when ignorance cease.

Live a hundred years, hundred years,  
Lazy, weak, no drive—  
Better ONE DAY with energy,  
One day truly alive.

Live a hundred years, hundred years,  
Never seeing rise and fall—  
Better ONE DAY seeing impermanence,  
One day seeing it all.

Live a hundred years, hundred years,  
Never seeing the deathless way—  
Better ONE DAY seeing nibbāna,  
One day lights the gray.

Live a hundred years, hundred years,  
Never seeing supreme Dhamma true—  
Better ONE DAY seeing clearly,  
One day breaking through.

One day awake beats a hundred years asleep.  
One day awake beats a hundred years asleep.  
One day awake—  
That's the only thing to keep.

**Blues Notes:** Six parallel verses contrast *vassasataṁ jīve* (living a hundred years) with *ekāhaṁ jīvitaṁ* (one day's life). Criteria: virtue, wisdom, energy, seeing impermanence (*udayabbaya*), seeing the deathless, seeing supreme Dhamma. One day with any of these beats a century without.

**Blues Notes on Translation Method:**

Every Blues singer knows: one line of truth cuts deeper than an hour of noise. The Buddha's teaching here matches the Blues aesthetic perfectly—strip away the padding, get to what matters. Quality over quantity. Depth over breadth. One moment seeing clear beats a lifetime in the dark.
