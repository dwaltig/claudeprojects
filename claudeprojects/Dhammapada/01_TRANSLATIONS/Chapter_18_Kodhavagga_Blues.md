# Chapter 17: Kodhavagga - Blues Edition
## Anger: Hold Back the Swerving Chariot

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

Anger. Swerving like a runaway chariot. Only the one who holds it back is the real driver—everyone else is just holding reins. This chapter gives the antidotes: overcome anger with non-anger, bad with good, stinginess with giving, lies with truth. And remember: nobody in the world escapes blame. Don't even try.

### Verses 221-223: The Charioteer

**The Blues Truth:**

Abandon anger, abandon conceit,  
Get past every chain.  
Don't cling to mind and body—  
And suffering won't remain.

Anger rises like a swerving chariot, chariot,  
Running off the road.  
Hold it back, hold it back—  
THAT'S the charioteer's code.

Others just hold the reins, the reins.  
They're along for the ride.  
But the one who CONTROLS the anger?  
THAT'S the one with real pride.

Overcome anger with NON-anger.  
Overcome bad with GOOD.  
Overcome stinginess with GIVING.  
Overcome lies with TRUTH.

**Blues Notes:** *Rathaṁ bhantaṁ va dhāraye* (like controlling a swerving chariot). Four antidotes: non-anger, goodness, giving, truth.

### Verses 224-226: Truth, No Anger, Give

**The Blues Truth:**

Speak truth. Don't get angry.  
Give when asked—even a little.  
These three things, these three things,  
Take you to the divine threshold.

Sages without violence,  
Restrained in body, always—  
They go to the deathless state,  
Gone there, they never grieve again.

Always wakeful, always wakeful,  
Training day and night.  
Intent on Nibbāna, Nibbāna—  
The pollutants lose their might.

### Verses 227-230: Nobody Escapes Blame

**The Blues Truth:**

This is OLD, Atula—not just today:  
People blame the quiet one.  
People blame the talker.  
People blame the moderate too.  
NOBODY in the world escapes being undone.

Never was, never will be,  
Nobody found yet—  
Totally blameworthy or totally praiseworthy.  
Don't hold your breath.

BUT—

One the wise examine and praise,  
Faultless, sagacious, wise—  
Like a gold coin of finest quality,  
Who's worthy to criticize?

The gods praise that one.  
Brahmā himself praises that one.  
Don't seek everyone's approval—  
Seek the praise of the WISE ONE.

**Blues Notes:** *Natthi loke anindito* (no one in the world is unblamed). Famous teaching to Atula. Don't chase universal approval—it doesn't exist.

### Verses 231-234: Three Gates

**The Blues Truth:**

Guard against anger in the BODY.  
Be restrained with the flesh.  
Drop the wrong; do the right.  
In body, be your best.

Guard against anger in SPEECH.  
Be restrained with the tongue.  
Drop the wrong; do the right.  
Watch what words are sung.

Guard against anger in MIND.  
Be restrained in thought.  
Drop the wrong; do the right.  
In mind, let anger rot.

Body, speech, and mind—  
Restrained in all three gates.  
The wise are FULLY restrained.  
That's the liberated state.
