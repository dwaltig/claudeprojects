# Chapter 10: Daṇḍavagga - Blues Edition
## Violence: The Rod That Returns

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

The rod. The stick. The fist. This chapter's about violence—and why it always comes back around. Everyone trembles at harm. Everyone loves their life. Feel that in yourself, and you'll stop hurting others. Be like a broken gong—struck but making no angry sound. That's the path to peace.

### Verses 129-130: Everyone Trembles

**The Blues Truth:**

Everyone trembles, trembles  
At the rod, at the stick.  
Everyone fears death, fears death—  
Nobody wants to be hit sick.

Compare yourself to others,  
Feel what THEY would feel.  
Then don't strike, don't have struck—  
That's the golden deal.

Everyone loves their life, their life,  
Everyone holds it dear.  
Knowing this, knowing this—  
Why would you bring them fear?

**Blues Notes:** *Attānaṁ upamaṁ katvā* (comparing oneself with others)—Buddhism's golden rule: feel how others feel, then act. *Na haneyya na ghātaye*—don't strike directly OR have someone strike for you.

### Verses 131-132: Harm Brings No Peace

**The Blues Truth:**

All beings want happiness, happiness,  
Just like you do too.  
Hurt them with the rod?  
No happiness comes to you.

After death, no peace—  
That's what the harmer gets.  
Seeking joy while causing pain?  
That's the worst of bets.

But don't harm with the rod,  
Don't hurt those who seek peace—  
After death, you find happiness,  
After death, release.

**Blues Notes:** *Sukhakāmā* (desiring happiness)—all beings share this. Harming them while seeking your own happiness is self-defeating.

### Verses 133-134: The Broken Gong

**The Blues Truth:**

Don't speak harsh, don't speak harsh—  
They might answer back.  
Arrogant talk brings misery,  
They might put you on the rack.

BUT—

If someone strikes you  
And you make no sound,  
Like a broken gong, a broken gong,  
Struck but silence all around—

You've reached Nibbāna, reached Nibbāna,  
No contention in your heart.  
Struck but silent, struck but peaceful—  
That's the wise one's art.

**Blues Notes:** *Kaṁso upahato* (broken gong) produces no sound when struck. The practitioner who doesn't resound with anger when attacked has eliminated contention. This is active peace, not suppression.

### Verse 135: Old Age and Death Drive Us

**The Blues Truth:**

Like a cowherd with a stick, with a stick,  
Drives cattle to pasture ground—  
Old age and death, old age and death,  
Drive us all around.

Inevitable, relentless,  
Moving us toward the end.  
Knowing this, knowing this—  
What harm would you extend?

**Blues Notes:** *Jarā ca maccu ca* (old age and death) drive all beings. This isn't fatalism—it's motivation. We're all headed the same way. Why hurt each other on the road?

### Verses 137-140: Ten Bad Returns

**The Blues Truth:**

Strike the harmless, hurt the pure?  
Ten bad things come your way:

Pain that's harsh,  
Loss of wealth,  
Body breaking down,  
Heavy sickness,  
Lose your mind,  
Kings bring you down,  
Slander terrible,  
Lose your kin,  
Possessions destroyed,  
Your house catches fire.

And when you die? The underworld.  
That's eleven for the price of violence.

Ten and one, ten and one—  
That's what violence brings.  
Strike the harmless, hurt the pure—  
Karma returns these things.

**Blues Notes:** Ten specific consequences for harming the harmless, plus rebirth in the underworld. The Buddha is very concrete here: violence has consequences in THIS life too.

### Verses 141-142: What Really Purifies

**The Blues Truth:**

Going naked won't purify you.  
Matted hair won't purify you.  
Mud and fasting won't purify you.  
Lying on rocks won't purify you.  
Dust and squatting won't purify you—  
If doubt is still in your heart.

BUT—

Even wearing fine clothes,  
If you're peaceful, trained, and true,  
Living the holy life,  
Laid down the rod toward ALL—

THAT'S a brahmin.  
THAT'S an ascetic.  
THAT'S a monastic.  
Not the costume—the conduct.

**Blues Notes:** External practices don't purify. *Nidhāya daṇḍaṁ sabbesu bhūtesu* (having laid down the rod toward all beings)—THAT makes you holy.

### Verses 143-145: Be Like the Good Horse

**The Blues Truth:**

Rare is the person, rare is the person,  
Restrained by conscience inside.  
Aware of their faults, aware of their faults,  
Like a good horse touched by the ride.

Be ardent, be intense,  
Like that good horse trained well.  
Faith, virtue, energy,  
Concentration—Dhamma you can tell.

Course-makers lead water.  
Fletchers straighten arrows.  
Carpenters straighten wood.  
The mild ones master themselves.

Master yourself, master yourself,  
Like the craftsman shapes the raw.  
Master yourself, master yourself—  
That's the highest law.

**Blues Notes:** The good horse needs only a light touch. Five qualities listed: *saddhā, sīla, viriya, samādhi, dhammavinicchaya* (faith, virtue, energy, concentration, Dhamma investigation). The craftsman metaphor returns: shape yourself.

**Blues Notes on Translation Method:**

The Blues knows violence. Every Blues singer has seen the rod—police batons, drunk fists, harsh words that cut deep. The Buddha's teaching here is direct: don't add to the pain. Be the broken gong that makes no angry sound when struck. That's not weakness—that's the strongest thing there is.
