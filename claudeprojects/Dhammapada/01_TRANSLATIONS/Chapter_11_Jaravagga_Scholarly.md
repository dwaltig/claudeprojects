# Chapter 11: Jarāvagga (Old Age)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Jarāvagga

The eleventh chapter confronts *jarā* (old age/decay). The body is a fortress of bones plastered with flesh; royal chariots decay; those who waste youth become like herons in a fishless lake. Most significantly, this chapter contains the Buddha's enlightenment poem (verses 153-154): "O Housebuilder, now you are seen!"

### Verse 146: Why Laughter?

**Verse 146**

Why this laughter, why this joy,  
When the world is constantly burning?  
Enveloped in darkness,  
Why do you not seek a light?[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Wake-Up Call**: *Ko nu hāso, kim ānando* (why laughter, why joy)—not anti-joy but perspective-shaking. The world *niccaṁ pajjalite* (constantly burning) with the three fires of greed, hatred, delusion. *Padīpaṁ na gavesatha* (why not seek a light?)—the Dhamma is the light.

### Verses 147-150: This Decaying Body

**Verse 147**

See this beautified puppet,  
A heap of sores raised up—  
Sick, imagined in many ways,  
With nothing stable or firm.

**Verse 148**

This body is worn out,  
A nest of disease, perishing.  
The putrid body comes to destruction—  
Life ends in death.

**Verse 149**

Like white gourds discarded in autumn  
Are these grey bones.  
Seeing them, why is there delight?

**Verse 150**

This fortress is made of bones,  
Plastered over with flesh and blood.  
But hidden within lie old age,  
Death, conceit, and anger.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **Contemplation of the Body**: Four verses progressively disenchant us from the body. *Bimba* (puppet/manikin) suggests something made-up. *Roganīḷa* (nest of disease) and *pūtisandeho* (putrid accumulation) are visceral. The bone-fortress simile shows the body's structure, with inner enemies (*jarā, maccu, māna, makkha*) hiding within.

### Verses 151-152: What Decays and What Doesn't

**Verse 151**

Decorated royal chariots decay,  
And the body also decays.  
But the Dhamma of the good does not decay—  
The good pass it to the good.

**Verse 152**

The person of little learning  
Grows old like an ox:  
His flesh increases,  
But his wisdom does not.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Two Trajectories**: Verse 151 contrasts perishable things (chariots, bodies) with imperishable Dhamma. Verse 152 offers a warning: *balivaddo va jīrati* (grows old like an ox)—the unlearned person gets physically larger but not wiser. *Maṁsāni vaḍḍhanti, paññā na vaḍḍhati* (flesh increases, wisdom doesn't).

### Verses 153-154: The Housebuilder

**Verse 153**

Through the round of countless births and deaths  
I have wandered without finding  
The housebuilder I was seeking—  
Born and suffering again and again.

**Verse 154**

O Housebuilder, now you are seen!  
You will not build the house again.  
All your rafters are broken,  
The ridgepole destroyed.  
My mind has reached the unconditioned;  
The end of craving has been achieved.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **The Buddha's Enlightenment Poem**: These two verses are traditionally the Buddha's first utterance after enlightenment. *Gahakāraka* (housebuilder) is *taṇhā* (craving) that constructs the house of rebirth. *Phāsukā bhaggā* (rafters broken) and *gahakūṭaṁ visaṅkhitaṁ* (ridgepole destroyed) mean the conditions for rebirth are demolished. *Visaṅkhāragataṁ cittaṁ* (mind reached the unconditioned)—nibbāna attained. *Taṇhānaṁ khayam-ajjhagā* (craving's end achieved)—liberation complete.

### Verses 155-156: Wasted Youth

**Verse 155**

Not having lived the holy life,  
Not having gained wealth in youth,  
They waste away like herons  
In a small lake devoid of fish.

**Verse 156**

Not having lived the holy life,  
Not having gained wealth in youth,  
They lie like spent arrows,  
Wailing about the past.[5]

#### Footnotes

[5] **Two Regrets**: Neither spiritual (*brahmacariya*) nor worldly (*dhana*) accomplishment in youth leads to pitiful old age. *Jiṇṇakoñcā* (old herons) in a *khīṇamacche pallale* (fishless puddle) captures helpless hunger. *Cāpātikhittā* (spent arrows) suggests exhausted energy. *Purāṇāni anutthunaṁ* (wailing about the past)—regret without remedy.
