# Chapter 9: Pāpavagga - Blues Edition
## Evil: Drop by Drop, the Pot Fills

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

Evil. Not some demon out there—it's what we DO that harms. And it accumulates. Drop by drop, the pot fills. Bit by bit, the karma builds. You can't outrun it. Can't hide in the sky, the sea, the mountain cave. This chapter tells it straight: hasten toward good, flee from evil, and know that every little thing counts.

### Verses 116-118: Hurry Toward Good

**The Blues Truth:**

Hurry toward the good, hurry toward the good,  
Keep the mind from wickedness.  
Slow to make merit? Slow to make merit?  
The mind slides toward the mess.

Do evil once? Don't do it again.  
Don't do it again, don't do it again.  
Don't set your heart there—  
Suffering piles up in the end.

Do good once? DO it again.  
Do it again, do it again.  
Set your heart there—  
Joy piles up. Amen.

**Blues Notes:** *Punappunaṁ* (again and again)—repetition builds momentum. Where you set your *chanda* (intention) matters. Evil accumulates suffering; merit accumulates joy.

### Verses 119-120: It Ripens When It Ripens

**The Blues Truth:**

The wicked may prosper, prosper  
While the evil hasn't ripened yet.  
But when that evil ripens, ripens,  
The wicked gets what the wicked gets.

The good may suffer, suffer  
While the good hasn't come through.  
But when the good fortune ripens,  
The good gets what's due.

Don't judge by today, by today.  
Karma ripens on its own time.  
Don't judge by today, by today—  
Wait for the fruit of the vine.

**Blues Notes:** *Paccati* (ripens)—karma matures like fruit. Current experience doesn't match current deeds because of time lag. But ripening is certain.

### Verses 121-122: Drop by Drop

**The Blues Truth:**

Don't dismiss evil thinking,  
"Won't touch me, won't touch me."  
Drop by drop, drop by drop,  
The water pot gets full.

The fool gathers, gathers,  
Bit by bit, becomes full of wrong.  
Drop by drop, drop by drop—  
That's how wickedness grows strong.

Don't dismiss merit thinking,  
"Won't reach me, won't reach me."  
Drop by drop, drop by drop,  
The water pot gets full.

The wise one gathers, gathers,  
Bit by bit, becomes full of right.  
Drop by drop, drop by drop—  
That's how goodness takes flight.

Little drops fill the pot.  
Little drops fill the pot.  
Every deed counts—  
Whether you think so or not.

**Blues Notes:** *Udabindunipātena udakumbho pūrati* (through falling drops the pot fills). Each drop seems nothing; together they fill the vessel. Never dismiss any action as too small to matter.

### Verses 123-124: Avoid the Poison

**The Blues Truth:**

Like a merchant on a dangerous road,  
Few friends, heavy load—  
Like someone who loves living  
Avoids the deadly sting—

Avoid evil, avoid evil,  
Like poison in your drink.  
Avoid evil, avoid evil—  
It's closer than you think.

BUT—

If no wound is in your hand,  
You can carry poison all day.  
Poison can't enter without a wound—  
Evil can't hurt the one who lives the right way.

**Blues Notes:** The wound metaphor: *nābbaṇaṁ visam-anveti* (poison doesn't enter without wound). If there's no opening for evil (no evil deed done), no bad result can enter.

### Verse 125: Dust Against the Wind

**The Blues Truth:**

Attack someone pure, someone harmless,  
Someone with no passion inside—  
That evil comes right back to you  
Like dust thrown against the tide.

Throw dust, throw dust against the wind—  
It blows right back in your face.  
Harm the harmless, hurt the pure—  
It returns to its starting place.

**Blues Notes:** *Sukhumo rajo paṭivātaṁ va khitto* (fine dust thrown against the wind). Attacking the pure backfires completely. The harm returns to the attacker.

### Verse 126: Where Do You End Up?

**The Blues Truth:**

Some come back as humans,  
Born again in a womb.  
Evildoers go down, go down,  
To the underworld's doom.

The righteous rise to heaven,  
The righteous rise up high.  
Those with no pollution left?  
They're free. They don't re-die.

Four roads, four roads,  
Depending how you live.  
Four roads, four roads—  
You choose which one you give.

**Blues Notes:** Four rebirth destinations: human womb, underworld (for evildoers), heaven (for righteous), *parinibbāna* (complete liberation for the pollutant-free).

### Verses 127-128: Nowhere to Hide

**The Blues Truth:**

Not in the sky, not in the sky,  
Not in the deep blue sea.  
Not in a mountain cave, mountain cave—  
There's nowhere you can flee.

No place on earth, no place on earth,  
Where you escape what you've done.  
No place on earth, no place on earth—  
Karma finds everyone.

Not in the sky, not in the sky,  
Not in the deep blue sea.  
Not in a mountain cave, mountain cave—  
Death finds you eventually.

No place on earth, no place on earth,  
Where death won't track you down.  
No place on earth, no place on earth—  
No hiding underground.

**Blues Notes:** Parallel verses: you can't hide from karma, you can't hide from death. *Antalikkhe, samuddamajjhe, pabbatānaṁ vivaraṁ*—sky, mid-ocean, mountain cleft. The universe has no hiding places.

**Blues Notes on Translation Method:**

The Blues knows about consequences. Every Blues song is about what happens after—after the choice, after the deed, after the night. The Buddha's teaching here matches: you can't escape what you do. But the flip side is hope—drop by drop, merit fills the pot too. Every good deed counts. Every bit of kindness accumulates. Choose what drops you're adding.
