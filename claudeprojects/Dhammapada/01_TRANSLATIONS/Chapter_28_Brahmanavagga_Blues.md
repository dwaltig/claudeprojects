# Chapter 28: Brāhmaṇavagga - Blues Edition
## The Brahmin: That One I Call Awakened

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

This is the FINAL chapter—the *Brāhmaṇavagga*. The Buddha redefines the holy person not by birth or lineage, but by observable conduct. It's the practical application of the Nibbāna described in the previous chapter.

### Verse 387: The Buddha's Radiance

**The Blues Truth:**

The SUN is radiant by day.  
The MOON shines by night.  
The armored NOBLE is radiant (in battle).  
The meditating BRAHMIN is radiant.

Yet every day AND night,  
The BUDDHA is radiant through his power.

Sun has its time. Moon has its time.  
Buddha? ALL the time.

---

### Verse 388: The Etymology of "Brahmin"

**The Blues Truth:**

WARDING OFF wickedness—  
That's what makes one a *brāhmaṇa*.  
Living austerely—  
That's what makes one a *samaṇa* (ascetic).  
Driving forth all stain from oneself—  
That's what makes one *pabbajita* (one who has gone forth).

The Buddha's redefining terms here.  
It's not about birth.  
It's about PRACTICE.

---

### Verses 389-390: Don't Strike a Brahmin

**The Blues Truth:**

Don't STRIKE a (true) brahmin.  
Don't let fly at him.

Woe to one who strikes a brahmin.  
FURTHER woe to one who lets fly!

And it is no LITTLE good for the brahmin  
When the mind is held back from what's dear,  
When the mind turns back from violence—  
THEN suffering calms.

Non-violence is the true brahmin's way.

---

### Verse 391: Restrained in Three Things

**The Blues Truth:**

For whom there is NO wrong-doing—  
Bodily, verbally, or mentally—  
Restrained in THREE things—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

Three doors. Three restraints.  
Body. Speech. Mind.  
Close the wrong doors.

---

### Verse 392: Bow to Your Teacher

**The Blues Truth:**

One from whom you learned Dhamma—  
Taught by the Perfect Buddha—

BOW to that one with respect,  
Like a brahmin bows at fire-sacrifice.

Honor your teachers.  
They gave you the Teaching.

---

### Verse 393-394: Not Birth, But Truth

**The Blues Truth:**

Not because of MATTED HAIR,  
Not because of FAMILY,  
Not because of BIRTH  
Is one a true brahmin.

In whom there is TRUTH and DHAMMA—  
That one is PURE.  
THAT one is surely a brahmin.

Why the matted hair, foolish one?  
Why the deer-skin?  
Within you is a JUNGLE.  
You only polish the OUTSIDE.

It's not the costume.  
It's what's INSIDE.

---

### Verse 395: The Forest Meditator

**The Blues Truth:**

That one who wears discarded clothes,  
LEAN with protruding veins,  
Who meditates ALONE in the forest—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

Not the well-fed. Not the comfortable.  
The ASCETIC. The solitary. The dedicated.

---

### Verse 396: Not Birth, But Non-Attachment

**The Blues Truth:**

I do NOT call one a brahmin  
Simply because of being born from a womb.

That one just says "bho" (a polite title)  
If he's still attached.

Having NOTHING and UNATTACHED—  
THAT one I call a brahmin.

Birth is accident.  
Non-attachment is CHOICE.

---

### Verse 397: Cut All Fetters, Don't Tremble

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever has CUT OFF all the fetters  
Surely does NOT tremble.

Surmounting attachments,  
Detached—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

When the chains are cut,  
Why would you shake?

---

### Verse 398: The Thong, the Strap, the Rope

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever has cut off the THONG,  
The STRAP,  
The ROPE,  
Together with the BRIDLE—

Who has thrown off the obstacle  
And is AWAKENED—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

What are these bonds?  
Hatred (thong), craving (strap), wrong views (rope), ignorance (bridle).  
Cut them ALL.

---

### Verse 399: Endurance Is Strength

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever, being PURE,  
Forbears with punishment, bondage, and abuse—  
Having the strength of ENDURANCE,  
Having an army of strengths—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

Patience isn't weakness.  
It's an ARMY.

---

### Verse 400: The Final Body

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever is controlled of mind,  
Dutiful, virtuous, taint-free,  
Well-trained  
And in the FINAL body—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

No more bodies after this.  
FINAL stop.

---

### Verse 401: Unsmeared by Desires

**The Blues Truth:**

Like WATER on the lotus leaf,  
Like a MUSTARD SEED on a needle—  
Not sticking—

He who is UNSMEARED by desires—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

The water rolls off.  
The seed can't balance.  
Desire DOESN'T STICK.

---

### Verse 402: Knowing Suffering's End

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever knows RIGHT HERE  
The destruction of suffering,  
Putting down the BURDEN,  
Detached—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

Not some other life.  
RIGHT HERE.  
Burden DOWN.

---

### Verse 403: Deeply Wise

**The Blues Truth:**

The DEEPLY wise sagacious one,  
Skilled in what IS path and what ISN'T path,  
Who has reached the ultimate good—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

Knows the way.  
Knows what's NOT the way.  
That discernment—THAT'S wisdom.

---

### Verse 404: Doesn't Mix

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever doesn't mix  
With either householders OR the houseless—  
Wandering homeless,  
With FEW desires—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

Not playing social games.  
Not accumulating contacts.  
UNENTANGLED.

---

### Verse 405: Laid Down the Stick

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever has laid down the STICK  
Used against all beings—  
Fearful AND fearless—  
Who neither hurts nor kills—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

The stick is DOWN.  
No violence.  
No killing.  
THAT'S the true brahmin.

---

### Verse 406: Friendly Among the Hostile

**The Blues Truth:**

Being FRIENDLY with the hostile,  
CALM amongst those holding sticks,  
NOT attached amongst those attached—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

They're angry—you're not.  
They're armed—you're calm.  
They're clinging—you're free.

---

### Verse 407: Passion Drops Like a Mustard Seed

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever has dropped off  
Passion and hatred,  
Conceit and anger—  
Like a MUSTARD SEED from a needle—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

Try balancing a mustard seed on a needle.  
It WON'T stay.  
That's how these defilements should be—  
Gone before they settle.

---

### Verse 408: Truth Spoken Gently

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever speaks a word of TRUTH  
That is informed and NOT coarse—  
Through which NO ONE would be angry—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

Truth doesn't have to hurt.  
Truth can be GENTLE.

---

### Verse 409: Takes Nothing Not Given

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever in this world  
Does NOT take what is not given—  
Long or short,  
Small or large,  
Attractive or unattractive—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

Nothing that isn't offered.  
NOTHING.

---

### Verse 410: No Longings

**The Blues Truth:**

For one who has NO longings—  
In this world OR the next—  
Being without longings,  
Detached—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

No craving for THIS life.  
No craving for the NEXT.  
Just... free.
