# Chapter 14: Buddhavagga (The Buddha)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Buddhavagga

The fourteenth chapter praises the qualities of the Awakened One. This shorter chapter focuses on the Buddha's nature as the "pathless one" (Verses 179-180) and the extreme rarity of his appearance in the world (Verse 182).

### Verses 179-180: The Pathless One

**Verse 179-180**

He whose victory cannot be undone,  
Whose victory no one in the world approaches,  
The Buddha, whose range is endless,  
The pathless one—by what path can you lead him?

He who has no ensnaring craving  
To lead him anywhere—  
The Buddha, whose range is endless,  
The pathless one—by what path can you lead him?[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Beyond Paths**: *Jitaṁ nāvajīyati* (victory that cannot be undone). *Anantagocara* (endless range) describes the Buddha's unlimited scope. *Apada* (pathless, without track)—like birds in sky, the Buddha leaves no trace for others to follow back. *Kena padena nessatha* (by what path can you lead?)—rhetorical: the liberated one cannot be led by desire.

### Verses 181-182: Divine Envy and Four Rare Things

**Verse 181**

Those wise ones intent on meditation,  
Who delight in the peace of renunciation—  
Even the gods are envious of them,  
The Fully Awakened Ones, the mindful.

**Verse 182**

Rare is birth as a human;  
Rare is the life of mortals;  
Rare is hearing the True Dhamma;  
Rare is the arising of Buddhas.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **Four Rarities**: *Kiccha* (rare, difficult to obtain) applies to: human birth, mortal life, hearing Dhamma, Buddha's arising. This "four rarities" teaching emphasizes our extraordinary opportunity—wasting it is tragedy.

### Verse 183: The Teaching of All Buddhas

**Verse 183**

The non-doing of any wickedness,  
The undertaking of what is good,  
The purification of one's own mind—  
This is the teaching of the Buddhas.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **The Ovāda Pāṭimokkha**: *Sabbapāpassa akaraṇaṁ, kusalassa upasampadā, sacittapariyodapanaṁ*—the famous three-part summary of all Buddha's teaching. Avoid evil, do good, purify the mind. Simple to state, lifetimes to accomplish.

### Verses 184-185: Non-Harm and Practice

**Verse 184**

Enduring patience is the supreme austerity.  
Nibbāna is supreme, say the Buddhas.  
One gone forth does not hurt another;  
An ascetic does not harass another.

**Verse 185**

Not finding fault, not hurting,  
Restraint by the discipline,  
Knowing the right measure of food,  
Living in a remote dwelling,  
Devotion to meditation—  
This is the teaching of the Buddhas.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **The Monastic Path**: *Khantī paramaṁ tapo* (patience is supreme austerity)—not self-torture but forbearance. The six guidelines: non-fault-finding, non-hurting, discipline, moderation in food, secluded dwelling, meditation practice.

### Verses 186-187: No Satisfaction in Pleasures

**Verse 186-187**

Not through a rain of coins  
Is satisfaction found in sense pleasures.  
The wise one knows: "Sense pleasures  
Have little joy and much suffering."  
Not even in heavenly pleasures  
Does that one find delight.  
The disciple of the Fully Awakened One  
Delights in craving's destruction.[5]

#### Footnotes

[5] **Beyond Pleasure**: *Kahāpaṇavassena* (rain of coins)—unlimited wealth cannot satisfy craving. *Appassādā dukhā kāmā* (sense pleasures have little joy, much suffering)—the Buddha's diagnosis. Even *dibbesu kāmesu* (heavenly pleasures) don't satisfy the wise. *Taṇhakkhayarato* (delighting in craving's destruction)—the Buddha's solution.
