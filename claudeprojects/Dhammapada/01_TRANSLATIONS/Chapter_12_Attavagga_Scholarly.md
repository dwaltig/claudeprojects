# Chapter 12: Attavagga (The Self)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Attavagga

The twelfth chapter addresses *attā* (self)—not metaphysical self-theory but practical self-responsibility. The teaching is radical: no one can purify another; by oneself is evil done, by oneself is one defiled, by oneself is one purified. The self is simultaneously one's own worst enemy and best friend.

### Verses 157-160: Self as Guardian and Friend

**Verse 157**

If one regards oneself as dear,  
One should guard oneself well.  
During one of the three watches of night,  
The wise one should stay alert.

**Verse 158**

First establish oneself in what is suitable,  
Then advise another.  
The wise one should not be defiled.

**Verse 159**

One should do oneself as one advises another.  
Being well-trained, one can train others—  
For the self is difficult to train.

**Verse 160**

The self is the friend of self—  
What other friend would there be?  
When the self is well-trained,  
One finds a friend hard to find.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Self-Reliance**: *Attā hi attano nātho* (self is the friend/protector of self). This isn't selfishness but self-responsibility. *Ko hi nātho paro siyā* (what other friend would there be?)—ultimately, no one can do the work for you. *Sudantena nāthaṁ labhati dullabhaṁ* (when well-trained, one finds a rare friend)—the trained self becomes one's own best companion.

### Verses 161-162: Self-Destruction

**Verse 161**

Evil done by oneself,  
Born in oneself, arising in oneself,  
Crushes the stupid one  
As a diamond crushes a rock-jewel.

**Verse 162**

One covered with exceeding lack of virtue,  
Like a deadly creeper on a Sāl tree,  
Makes oneself become  
What one's enemy wishes.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **Self-Inflicted Harm**: *Attanā va kataṁ pāpaṁ* (evil done by oneself) crushes oneself—external enemies unnecessary. The diamond crushing a gem simile shows the hardness of self-generated karma. The *māluvā* (strangling vine) on the *sāla* (Sāl tree) is an ancient Indian image: the vine eventually kills its host.

### Verses 163-165: The Great Teaching on Self-Purification

**Verse 163**

Easy to do are things not good,  
Unbeneficial for oneself.  
But that which is beneficial and good  
Is supremely hard to do.

**Verse 164**

Whoever reviles the noble teaching  
Of the Arahants who live by Dhamma,  
That stupid one, depending on wicked views,  
Brings about his own destruction—  
Like bamboo that bears fruit.

**Verse 165**

By oneself alone is evil done;  
By oneself is one defiled.  
By oneself alone is evil not done;  
By oneself is one purified.  
Purity and impurity come from oneself—  
No one can purify another.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Radical Self-Responsibility**: *Suddhī asuddhī paccattaṁ, nāñño aññaṁ visodhaye* (purity and impurity are one's own; no one can purify another). This is Buddhism's most radical ethical statement. No savior, no external purification—each person must do the work themselves. The bamboo simile: some bamboo species die after fruiting; reviling Dhamma brings similar self-destruction.

### Verse 166: Know Your Own Good

**Verse 166**

One should not neglect one's own good  
For another's, however great.  
Knowing what is good for oneself,  
One should be intent on that good.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **Prioritized Self-Care**: *Atta-d-atthaṁ paratthena bahunā pi na hāpaye* (don't neglect your own good for another's, however great). This isn't selfishness—it's recognizing that without self-cultivation, you cannot help others. Establish yourself first, then help others (verse 158).
