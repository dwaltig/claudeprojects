# Chapter 7: Arahantavagga - Blues Edition
## The Arahants: Those Who Made It All the Way

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

This chapter's about the ones who MADE IT. The arahants—the perfected ones. No more craving, no more suffering, no more rebirth. They leave no track like birds in the sky. Stand unmoved like earth, like a city-post, like a clear lake. Even the gods are jealous. This is what the path leads to. This is why we practice.

### Verse 90: No More Fever

**The Blues Truth:**

Reached the goal, reached the goal,  
No more grief on any side.  
Reached the goal, reached the goal,  
All the knots untied.

No consuming fever,  
No burning in the chest.  
No consuming fever—  
This one is at rest.

**Blues Notes:** *Pariḷāho* (consuming fever, burning)—the inner torment of craving. When all the *gantha* (knots) are cut, the fever breaks forever.

### Verse 91: Geese Leaving the Lake

**The Blues Truth:**

Mindful ones keep striving,  
Don't cling to where they stay.  
Like geese who leave the lake behind,  
They fly on away.

Home after home, home after home,  
They leave it all behind.  
Home after home, home after home—  
Nothing holds their mind.

Like geese on the wing,  
Like geese on the wing,  
Moving on, moving on,  
No fondness for anything.

**Blues Notes:** *Haṁsā va pallalaṁ hitvā* (like geese abandoning a lake). Wild geese migrate without attachment to temporary waters. The arahat moves on, never clinging.

### Verses 92-93: No Tracks in the Sky

**The Blues Truth:**

No stores to guard, no stores to guard,  
Eating just what they need.  
Living in liberation,  
Empty, signless, freed.

Like birds in the sky,  
Like birds in the sky,  
Their track is hard to find.  
Like birds in the sky,  
Like birds in the sky,  
No footprints left behind.

Pollutants destroyed, pollutants destroyed,  
Not dependent on a thing.  
Flying through emptiness,  
No track for death to bring.

Birds leave no marks in the air.  
The perfected leave no path to trace.  
Māra searches everywhere—  
Can't find them anyplace.

**Blues Notes:** *Ākāse va sakuntānaṁ gati durannayā* (like birds in sky, their track is hard to find). The arahat lives in *suññato animitto vimokkho* (liberation that is empty and signless)—no trace for rebirth to follow.

### Verse 94: Even the Gods Are Jealous

**The Blues Truth:**

Senses stilled, senses stilled,  
Like horses trained just right.  
Senses stilled, senses stilled,  
Charioteer holding tight.

Conceit abandoned, pollutants gone—  
Even the gods look down and sigh.  
EVEN THE GODS are jealous of this one,  
Even the gods can't reach that high.

Gods have pleasure but they're still bound.  
This one is FREE.  
Gods will fall back down one day—  
This one won't be.

**Blues Notes:** *Devā pi pihayanti* (even gods envy). Remarkable: celestial beings, for all their pleasure, cannot match the arahat. Gods are still bound to rebirth; the arahat is truly free.

### Verse 95: Earth, Post, Lake

**The Blues Truth:**

Untroubled like the earth, like the earth—  
Pour anything on, it don't react.  
Untroubled like the earth, like the earth—  
Steady, solid, that's a fact.

Steadfast like a city-post, city-post—  
Driven deep, won't ever sway.  
Steadfast like a city-post, city-post—  
Standing there to stay.

Clear like a lake with no mud, no mud—  
Pure from bottom to top.  
Clear like a lake with no mud, no mud—  
Where birth and death stop.

Earth. Post. Lake.  
No more rounds to make.

**Blues Notes:** Three stability images: *paṭhavisamo* (like earth), *indakhīlūpama* (like city-post), *rahado apetakaddamo* (lake free from mud). *Saṁsārā na bhavanti*—samsara ends for such a one.

### Verse 96: Peace in Mind, Speech, and Action

**The Blues Truth:**

Calm in mind, calm in mind,  
Calm in speech, calm in deed.  
Calm in mind, calm in mind—  
Liberated, truly freed.

Through and through, through and through,  
Peace has filled every part.  
Through and through, through and through,  
In action, word, and heart.

**Blues Notes:** *Santaṁ manaṁ, santā vācā, santaṁ kammaṁ*—calm mind, calm speech, calm action. *Upasanta* (truly peaceful): peace has perfused every aspect of being.

### Verse 97: The Supreme Person

**The Blues Truth:**

Beyond mere faith—they KNOW.  
They know the unmade, the unconditioned ground.  
Cut off rebirth-linking,  
Destroyed the occasion, can't be found.

Thrown out hope, thrown out desire,  
Nothing left to chase.  
This one, THIS ONE,  
Is the supreme of the race.

Supreme person, supreme person—  
The highest we can be.  
Supreme person, supreme person—  
Utterly free.

**Blues Notes:** Five marks of the *uttamaporiso* (supreme person): beyond faith (direct knowledge), knows the unmade (nibbāna), cut the rebirth-link, destroyed occasion for becoming, ejected all craving.

### Verse 98: Wherever They Live Is Holy Ground

**The Blues Truth:**

Village or wilderness,  
Low ground or high—  
WHEREVER the arahants dwell,  
That ground is blessed thereby.

They don't need a special place.  
The place needs THEM.  
Wherever they sit down,  
That's where the light comes in.

**Blues Notes:** *Yattharahanto viharanti, taṁ bhūmiṁ rāmaṇeyyakaṁ* (wherever arahants live, that ground is delightful). The person blesses the place, not the other way around.

---

### Verse 99: Joy Where Others Can't Find It

**The Blues Truth:**

Delightful wilderness, delightful wilderness—  
But regular folks get bored.  
Nothing to chase, nothing to buy,  
Nothing that they're looking for.

But those without passion?  
They find the joy right there.  
Not seeking sense pleasure—  
They find joy EVERYWHERE.

What others flee from,  
They call home.  
What others can't stand,  
They never want to roam.

**Blues Notes:** *Vītarāgā ramissanti* (those without passion delight). The arahat, desiring nothing, can appreciate what IS. Their joy doesn't depend on getting something; it just IS.

**Blues Notes on Translation Method:**

The arahat is what we're all moving toward. Not cold detachment but complete freedom—the fever broken, the knots cut, the track impossible to trace. The Blues knows longing; the arahat knows fulfillment. The Blues knows suffering; the arahat knows peace. This chapter shows what's possible at the end of the road.
