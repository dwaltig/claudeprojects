# Chapter 8: Sahassavagga (Thousands)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Sahassavagga

The eighth chapter develops a sustained argument through comparison: better one meaningful thing than thousands of meaningless things. The pattern "better one X than a thousand Y" applies to words, verses, victories, sacrifices, and even life-years. Quality over quantity; depth over breadth; a moment of insight over a lifetime of blindness.

### Verses 100-102: Words and Verses

**Verse 100**

Though there be a thousand sayings  
Consisting of useless words,  
Better is one useful word  
Hearing which one is brought to peace.

**Verse 101**

Though there be a thousand verses  
Consisting of useless words,  
Better is one word of verse  
Hearing which one is brought to peace.

**Verse 102**

One may speak a hundred verses  
Consisting of useless words,  
Better is one verse of Dhamma  
Hearing which one is brought to peace.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Quantity vs. Quality in Speech**: *Sahassa* (thousand) and *sata* (hundred) contrast with *eka* (one). *Anatthapadasaṁhitā* (consisting of useless/meaningless words) describes empty speech. *Upasammati* (brought to peace, calmed) is the criterion: words that pacify the mind are valuable regardless of quantity.

### Verses 103-105: Conquest of Self

**Verse 103**

One may conquer a thousand men  
A thousand times in battle—  
But conquering one's own self  
Is supreme in battle.

**Verses 104-105**

Conquest over self is better  
Than conquest over other people.  
For the person who restrains themselves,  
Who lives constantly well-controlled—  
Neither gods, nor gandhabbas,  
Nor Māra together with Brahmā,  
Can turn that victory into defeat.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **The Unconquerable Victory**: *Saṅgāmajuttamo* (supreme in battle) redefines conquest: not over armies but over oneself. *Attadanta* (self-restrained) and *niccaṁ saññatacāri* (constantly living controlled) describe the victor. The remarkable claim: even divine beings (*deva, gandhabba, Māra, Brahmā*) cannot reverse this victory. External conquests can always be undone; internal victory is permanent.

### Verses 106-108: Worship vs. Sacrifice

**Verse 106**

One might give alms monthly  
A thousand coins for a hundred years;  
Yet one who worships someone  
With developed self for a moment—  
That worship is better than the hundred-year sacrifice.

**Verse 107**

One might tend the sacred fire  
In the forest for a hundred years;  
Yet one who worships someone  
With developed self for a moment—  
That worship is better than the hundred-year sacrifice.

**Verse 108**

Whatever alms or sacrifice in the world  
The merit-seeker gives for a year—  
All that comes not to a quarter  
Of worshipping the upright.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Worthy Recipients**: *Bhāvitattāna* (one with developed self) is the worthy recipient. *Muhuttam-api* (even for a moment)—the briefest genuine worship surpasses years of undirected giving. The hundred-year sacrifice (*vassasataṁ hutaṁ*) represents maximum worldly religiosity; a moment's honor to a worthy person exceeds it.

### Verse 109: Four Benefits

**Verse 109**

For one who constantly worships honorable elders,  
Four things increase:  
Length of life, beauty, happiness, and strength.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **Concrete Benefits**: *Abhivādanasīli* (habit of worshipping) and *vaddhāpacāyi* (honoring elders/seniors) are the practices. *Āyu, vaṇṇa, sukha, bala* (life, beauty, happiness, strength) are the four benefits—practical, worldly goods arising from spiritual practice.

### Verses 110-115: One Day vs. A Hundred Years

**Verse 110**

One might live a hundred years  
Unvirtuous and uncomposed—  
Better is one day of life  
For one with virtue and meditation.

**Verse 111**

One might live a hundred years  
Lacking wisdom and uncomposed—  
Better is one day of life  
For one with wisdom and meditation.

**Verse 112**

One might live a hundred years  
Indolent, with weak energy—  
Better is one day of life  
For one whose energy is firm.

**Verse 113**

One might live a hundred years  
Without seeing rise and fall—  
Better is one day of life  
For one who sees rise and fall.

**Verse 114**

One might live a hundred years  
Without seeing the deathless state—  
Better is one day of life  
For one who sees the deathless state.

**Verse 115**

One might live a hundred years  
Without seeing the supreme Dhamma—  
Better is one day of life  
For one who sees the supreme Dhamma.[5]

#### Footnotes

[5] **The Better Day**: Six parallel verses value quality over quantity in life itself. *Vassasataṁ jīve* (live a hundred years) contrasts with *ekāhaṁ jīvitaṁ* (one day's life). The criteria: virtue, wisdom, energy, seeing impermanence (*udayabbaya*—rise and fall), seeing the deathless (*amataṁ padaṁ*), seeing supreme Dhamma. A single day with any of these exceeds a century without.
