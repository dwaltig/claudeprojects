# Chapter 11: Jarāvagga - Blues Edition
## Old Age: The Housebuilder Has Been Seen

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

Old age. The body wearing down. Bones like dried gourds. But here's the treasure: the Buddha's ENLIGHTENMENT POEM is in this chapter. "O Housebuilder, now you are seen! You won't build this house again." That's the moment of liberation—craving exposed and defeated. This chapter holds both the hard truth of decay and the glorious truth of freedom.

### Verse 146: Why Are You Laughing?

**The Blues Truth:**

Why the laughter, why the laughter?  
Why the joy when the world's on fire?  
Wrapped in darkness, wrapped in darkness—  
Why don't you seek something higher?

The world burns, burns, burns  
With greed and hate and confusion.  
Enveloped in the dark—  
Why not seek the light's intrusion?

**Blues Notes:** *Niccaṁ pajjalite* (constantly burning)—the three fires of greed, hatred, delusion. *Padīpaṁ* (a light)—the Dhamma is that light.

### Verses 147-150: This Body Is Falling Apart

**The Blues Truth:**

See this beautified puppet, puppet,  
A heap of sores dressed up fine.  
Sick, imagined, nothing stable—  
Nothing in it's truly mine.

This body, this body—  
Worn out, nest of disease.  
The putrid thing breaks down, breaks down—  
Life ends without reprieve.

Like white gourds thrown in autumn,  
These grey bones scattered round.  
Seeing them, seeing them—  
Why delight in what's unwound?

This fortress made of bones, of bones,  
Plastered over with flesh and blood.  
But inside hides old age, hides death,  
Hides conceit and anger's flood.

**Blues Notes:** Four verses strip away glamour from the body. *Roganīḷa* (nest of disease), *pūtisandeho* (putrid mass), *aṭṭhīnaṁ nagara* (fortress of bones). Inner enemies hide within.

### Verses 151-152: What Lasts and What Doesn't

**The Blues Truth:**

Royal chariots decay, decay,  
Even the golden ones rust away.  
Bodies decay, bodies decay—  
Everything fades at the end of day.

BUT—

The Dhamma of the good doesn't fade,  
The Dhamma of the good stays true.  
The good pass it on to the good—  
That's the treasure that breaks through.

The person who doesn't learn, doesn't learn,  
Grows old like an ox in the field.  
Flesh gets bigger, wisdom stays small—  
Nothing real is revealed.

**Blues Notes:** *Satañ-ca Dhammo na jaraṁ upeti* (the Dhamma of the good doesn't decay). Bodies and chariots decay; truth passes on. The ox simile: *maṁsāni vaḍḍhanti, paññā na vaḍḍhati* (flesh increases, wisdom doesn't).

### Verses 153-154: The Housebuilder (The Buddha's Enlightenment Song)

**The Blues Truth:**

Through countless births, countless deaths,  
I wandered and I wandered.  
Seeking the housebuilder, seeking the one  
Who built this pain I've squandered.

Born again, suffering again,  
Round and round I roamed.  
Looking for the one who made this house,  
This prison I called home.

BUT NOW—

O HOUSEBUILDER, I SEE YOU NOW!  
You won't build this house again!  
All your rafters are BROKEN,  
The ridgepole's at its end!

My mind has reached the unconditioned,  
Craving's end has been achieved.  
You won't build this house again—  
I am FREED. I am FREED.

No more building, no more building,  
The house of birth and death.  
The Housebuilder's been seen, been seen—  
I breathe liberation's breath.

**Blues Notes:** The Buddha's first words after enlightenment. *Gahakāraka* (housebuilder) = *taṇhā* (craving) that constructs rebirth. *Phāsukā bhaggā* (rafters broken), *gahakūṭaṁ visaṅkhitaṁ* (ridgepole destroyed). *Visaṅkhāragataṁ cittaṁ* (mind reached the unconditioned). THIS IS THE LIBERATION SONG.

### Verses 155-156: Don't Waste Your Youth

**The Blues Truth:**

Didn't live the holy life,  
Didn't get wealth when young—  
Now they waste away, waste away,  
Like herons where no fish have swum.

Empty lake, empty lake,  
Nothing left to catch.  
Old and hungry, old and hungry—  
That's the wasted match.

Didn't live the holy life,  
Didn't get wealth when young—  
Now they lie like spent arrows,  
Wailing for what's done.

Shot and fallen, shot and fallen,  
Crying about the past.  
Too late, too late, too late—  
Youth didn't last.

**Blues Notes:** Two regrets: no spiritual accomplishment (*brahmacariya*) AND no worldly accomplishment (*dhana*). *Jiṇṇakoñcā* (old herons) in a fishless puddle. *Cāpātikhittā* (spent arrows). *Purāṇāni anutthunaṁ* (wailing about the past).

Freedom has been found.

**Blues Notes on Translation Method:**

This chapter contains the Buddha's ENLIGHTENMENT POEM—the moment of liberation itself. The Blues knows about freedom songs, about breaking chains, about seeing the oppressor clearly for the first time. "O Housebuilder, I see you now!" is the ultimate freedom cry. Everything in this chapter builds toward that moment of seeing—and being free.
