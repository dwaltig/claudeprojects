# Chapter 24: Taṇhāvagga (Craving)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Taṇhāvagga

The twenty-fourth chapter addresses *taṇhā*—craving, thirst, desire—identified in the Second Noble Truth as the origin of suffering (*dukkha-samudaya*). This is among the Dhammapada's most doctrinally significant chapters, treating Buddhism's core diagnostic insight: that suffering arises from craving and ceases with craving's destruction.

The chapter employs rich organic imagery: craving is a vine (*māluvā*), a creeper (*latā*), grass growing after rain (*bīraṇa*), streams flowing everywhere (*sotā*). These metaphors emphasize craving's tenacity, its tendency to spread, and its deep roots. Against this, the Buddha prescribes radical uprooting (*mūlaṁ khaṇatha*, "dig up the root")—superficial pruning allows regrowth.

The chapter climaxes with the Buddha's own declaration of liberation (verse 353) and the famous verse identifying the Dhamma as supreme gift, taste, and delight (verse 354). The concluding verses (356-359) systematically identify the "weeds" that ruin beings: passion, hatred, delusion, and desire.

### Verses 334-335: Craving's Growth

**Verse 334**

For a human who lives heedlessly,
Craving increases like a clinging creeper.
They rush from one existence to another
Like a monkey seeking fruit in the forest.[1]

**Verse 335**

One overcome by this wretched craving,
This attachment to the world—
For them griefs increase
Like grass after heavy rain.[2]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Māluvā viya**: The *māluvā* (a parasitic vine that strangles trees) perfectly illustrates *taṇhā*: it clings, spreads, and eventually destroys its host. The *pamattacārin* (one living heedlessly) experiences craving's expansion. *Palavati hurāhuraṁ* ("rushes from here to there") describes existential restlessness—like a *vānara* (monkey) *phalām-icchaṁ* (desiring fruit) *vanasmi* (in the forest). The image captures saṃsāric wandering: driven by desire, we leap from existence to existence, never satisfied.

[2] **Bīraṇaṁ Abhivaṭṭhaṁ**: *Bīraṇa* grass springs up abundantly after rain (*abhivaṭṭha*, "rained upon"). For one *sahatī* (overcome) by *jammī taṇhā* (wretched craving) and *visattikā* (attachment, clinging), *sokā* (griefs) similarly *pavaḍḍhanti* (increase, grow). The agricultural metaphor is apt: just as monsoon rains produce rapid grass growth, craving-conditions produce rapid grief-proliferation.

### Verses 336-337: Overcoming Craving

**Verse 336**

Whoever overcomes this wretched craving in the world,
Which is difficult to transcend—
Griefs fall from them
Like a water drop from a lotus.[3]

**Verse 337**

This I say to you: "Good fortune to all gathered here!"
Dig up the root of craving,
Like one seeking the fragrant root digs up grass.
Do not let Māra break you again and again,
Like a stream breaks the reed.[4]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Udabindu va Pokkharā**: For one who *sahatī* (overcomes) *duraccayaṁ* (hard-to-transcend) craving, *sokā* (griefs) *papatanti* (fall away) like *udabindu* (water drop) from *pokkhara* (lotus leaf). The lotus's waxy surface repels water—drops bead and roll off. Similarly, the mind freed from craving doesn't retain grief; suffering slides away without purchase.

[4] **Taṇhāya Mūlaṁ Khaṇatha**: The Buddha directly addresses the assembly: *khaṇatha* (dig up, excavate) the *mūla* (root) of *taṇhā*. The simile is *usīrattha* (one seeking fragrant *usīra* root) digging up the whole grass plant. Merely cutting craving's surface manifestations allows regrowth; the root must be extracted. The counter-warning: don't let *Māra* *bhañji* (break, crush) you *punappunaṁ* (again and again), like a *sota* (stream, current) *bhañji* (breaks) *naḷaṁ* (reeds).

### Verses 338-340: Root and Stream

**Verse 338**

Just as a tree cut down grows again
When its root remains firm and untroubled,
So when the tendency to craving is not rooted out,
This suffering arises again and again.[5]

**Verse 339**

One in whom the thirty-six streams flow strong,
Streams flowing toward the pleasant—
Such a one of wrong view is carried away
By passionate intentions.[6]

**Verse 340**

Streams flow everywhere;
The creeper springs up and stands.
Seeing that creeper arisen,
Cut its root with wisdom.[7]

#### Footnotes

[5] **Taṇhānusaye Anūhate**: *Anusaya* (latent tendency, underlying tendency) represents craving's deepest form—not active desire but the predisposition to desire. When this is *anūhata* (not uprooted, not dug out), *dukkha* *nibbattatī* (arises, appears) *punappunaṁ* (again and again). The tree metaphor is precise: surface cutting produces regrowth; only root-destruction ends the cycle.

[6] **Chattiṁsatī Sotā**: The "thirty-six streams" traditionally represent craving operating through six sense bases (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind) multiplied by six objects, or alternatively, craving in three modes (for sensuality, existence, non-existence) across twelve sense-object combinations. *Manāpassavanā* (flowing toward the pleasant) describes hedonic orientation. Such a person is *vahanti* (carried away) by *saṅkappā* (intentions, thoughts) *rāganissitā* (dependent on passion).

[7] **Mūlaṁ Paññāya Chindatha**: The instruction is direct: *disvā* (seeing) the *latā jātā* (creeper arisen), *chindatha* (cut) its *mūla* (root) *paññāya* (with wisdom). Insight (*paññā*) is the instrument of liberation—not force or suppression but clear seeing of craving's nature and origin.

### Verses 341-343: The Crawling Hare

**Verse 341**

There are flowing streams of affection
And mental pleasures for a person.
Dependent on pleasures, seeking happiness,
Those people undergo birth and aging.[8]

**Verse 342**

People surrounded by craving
Crawl around like a hare caught in a trap.
Attached and clinging to fetters,
They return to suffering again and again, for long.[9]

**Verse 343**

People surrounded by craving
Crawl around like a hare caught in a trap.
Therefore, the monk longing for dispassion
Should remove craving.[10]

#### Footnotes

[8] **Saritāni Sinehitāni**: *Sneha* (affection, attachment, viscosity—like oil clinging) produces *somanassa* (mental happiness, pleasure). Those *sātasitā* (attached to pleasure) and *sukhesino* (seeking happiness) become *jātijarūpagā* (undergoers of birth and old age). The verse describes ordinary life: pleasant feelings create attachment; attachment creates rebirth; rebirth guarantees old age and death.

[9] **Saso va Bādhito**: *Pajā* (people, beings) *purakkhatā* (surrounded, preceded) by *tasiṇā* (thirst, intense craving) *parisappanti* (crawl around, creep about) like *saso* (hare) *bādhito* (caught, trapped). The image is vivid: a snared hare struggles desperately but only tightens the trap. *Saṁyojanasaṅgasattakā* (attached and clinging to fetters)—bound by the ten fetters that chain beings to saṃsāra.

[10] **Bhikkhu Ākaṅkha Virāgam-attano**: The solution for the *bhikkhu* (monk, mendicant) who *ākaṅkhati* (longs for, desires) *virāga* (dispassion, fading away of lust) *attano* (for oneself) is to *vinodaye* (remove, dispel) *tasiṇaṁ* (craving). The very desire for liberation (*virāga*) must be employed to destroy desire.

### Verses 344-347: True and False Bondage

**Verse 344**

One freed from the woods, intent on the forest—
Though freed from the forest, runs back to the forest.
Come, look at this person:
Though freed, running back to bondage.[11]

**Verse 345-346**

That bondage is not strong, say the wise,
Which is made of iron, wood, or reeds.
But impassioned attraction to jewels and earrings,
Longing for children and wives—
This bondage is strong, say the wise,
Dragging down, yielding, hard to escape.
Having cut even this, they wander forth,
Seeking nothing, abandoning sensual happiness.[12]

**Verse 347**

Those impassioned by passion follow the stream
Like a spider its self-made web.
Having cut even this, the wise proceed,
Seeking nothing, abandoning all suffering.[13]

#### Footnotes

[11] **Nibbanatho Vanādhimutto**: This verse contains famous wordplay on *vana* (forest) and *vana* (desire/craving—a different word but homophonous in some contexts). One *nibbanatha* (freed from desires) yet *vanādhimutta* (intent on the forest/craving), though *vanamutto* (freed from forest/craving), *vanam-eva dhāvati* (runs right back to forest/craving). The teaching: liberation from one form of attachment often leads to attachment in another form. Even spiritual attainment can become a new object of craving.

[12] **Āyasaṁ Dārujaṁ Pabbajañ-ca**: Physical bonds—*āyasa* (iron), *dāruja* (wooden), *pabbaja* (made of reeds/grass)—are *na daḷha* (not strong) compared to psychological attachment. *Sārattarattā* (thoroughly impassioned) seeking *maṇikuṇḍalesu* (jewels and earrings) and *apekhā* (longing) for *puttesu dāresu* (children and wives)—these are *daḷha* (firm, strong) bonds. They are *ohārina* (dragging down), *sithila* (yielding, soft), yet *duppamuñca* (hard to escape). The truly liberated *chetvā* (having cut) this *paribbajanti* (wander forth) *anapekkhino* (seeking nothing).

[13] **Makkaṭako va Jālaṁ**: Those *rāgarattā* (impassioned by passion) *anupatanti sotaṁ* (follow the stream, fall into the current) *sayaṁkataṁ* (self-made) like a *makkaṭaka* (spider) and its *jāla* (web). We create our own entrapment; our attachments are self-spun. The *dhīrā* (wise) *chetvā* (having cut) this web *vajanti* (proceed) *anapekkhino* (seeking nothing), *sabbadukkhaṁ pahāya* (having abandoned all suffering).

### Verse 348: Liberation from Time

Be free of the past, be free of the future,
Be free of the present.
Having crossed over existence,
With mind liberated in every way,
You will not return to birth and aging.[14]

#### Footnotes

[14] **Muñca Pure Pacchato Majjhe**: *Muñca* (release, let go) is applied to all three times: *pure* (before, the past), *pacchato* (after, the future), *majjhe* (middle, the present). This teaching transcends ordinary time-bound practice. By releasing attachment to past, future, and present, one becomes *pāragū bhavassa* (one gone beyond existence). *Sabbattha vimuttamānaso* (with mind liberated everywhere)—complete liberation in all modes. Result: *na punaṁ jātijaraṁ upehisi* (you will not again approach birth and aging).

### Verses 349-350: Thought and Counter-Practice

**Verse 349**

For a person crushed by thoughts,
Of intense passion, contemplating the attractive—
Craving increases more and more.
This surely makes the bond firm.[15]

**Verse 350**

Whoever delights in thought-calmment,
Always mindfully cultivating the unattractive—
Will surely abolish this craving;
They will cut Māra's bond.[16]

#### Footnotes

[15] **Vitakkapamathitassa**: One *pamathita* (crushed, agitated, tormented) by *vitakka* (thoughts, mental applications), possessing *tibbarāga* (intense passion) and *subhānupassin* (contemplating the pleasant/attractive), experiences *taṇhā* (craving) *bhiyyo pavaḍḍhati* (increasing more). This *daḷhaṁ karoti bandhanaṁ* (makes the bond firm)—a vicious cycle of thought, passion, and craving reinforcing each other.

[16] **Vitakkupasame Rato**: The antidote: *rata* (delight) in *vitakkupasama* (calming of thoughts)—meditation that stills discursive thinking. *Bhāvayati* (cultivates) *asubhaṁ* (the unattractive, contemplation of decomposition) *sadā sato* (always mindful). This *vyantikāhiti* (abolishes, makes an end of) craving and *checchati Mārabandhanaṁ* (cuts Māra's bond). Contemplating the unattractive counteracts the "attractive-contemplation" of verse 349.

### Verses 351-352: The Accomplished One

**Verse 351**

Having gone to the end, without trembling,
Without craving, without defilement,
Having cut the thorns of existence—
This is their final body.[17]

**Verse 352**

Without craving, without grasping,
Skilled in expressions and their order,
Knowing how syllables are arranged,
Which come before and which after—
This one in their final body
Is called "one of great wisdom."[18]

#### Footnotes

[17] **Niṭṭhaṁ Gato Asantāsī**: *Niṭṭhaṁ gata* (gone to completion, reached the goal), *asantāsī* (without trembling, fearless), *vītataṇha* (without craving), *anaṅgaṇa* (spotless, without defilement)—this person has *acchindi* (cut off) *bhavasallāni* (the thorns/arrows of existence). *Antimoyaṁ samussayo* (this is the final combination/body)—no more rebirth follows.

[18] **Niruttipadakovido**: The arahant is also *kovida* (skilled, expert) in *nirutti* (language, etymology) and *pada* (expressions, words). They understand *akkharānaṁ sannipātaṁ* (how syllables combine) and *pubbaparāni* (what comes before and after—sequence, grammar). This describes mastery of teaching ability alongside liberation. Such a one is *antimasārīra* (in their final body) and *mahāpañña* (of great wisdom).

### Verse 353: The Buddha's Declaration

"All-Conquering, All-Wise am I,
Undefiled regarding all things,
Having given up everything,
Liberated through craving's destruction.
Having known directly myself—
Whom should I point to as Teacher?"[19]

#### Footnotes

[19] **Sabbābhibhū Sabbavidū**: This verse is attributed to the Buddha himself at the moment of enlightenment. *Sabbābhibhū* (all-conquering, having overcome all), *sabbavidu* (all-knowing), *anūpalitto* (undefiled, unstained) regarding *sabbesu dhammesu* (all phenomena). *Sabbañjaha* (having abandoned all), *vimutta* (liberated) *taṇhakkhaye* (through craving's destruction). The rhetorical question *kam-uddiseyyaṁ* (whom should I point to) indicates self-enlightenment without teacher—the unprecedented achievement of Buddhahood.

### Verse 354: The Supreme Gift

The gift of Dhamma surpasses all gifts;
The taste of Dhamma surpasses all tastes;
The love of Dhamma surpasses all loves;
The destruction of craving overcomes all suffering.[20]

#### Footnotes

[20] **Sabbadānaṁ Dhammadānaṁ Jināti**: This frequently-quoted verse establishes hierarchies: *dhammadāna* (gift of teaching) *jināti* (conquers, surpasses) *sabbadānaṁ* (all gifts). *Dhammarasa* (taste of truth) *jināti sabbaṁ rasaṁ* (conquers all tastes). *Dhammarati* (love/delight in teaching) *jināti sabbaṁ ratiṁ* (conquers all delights). Finally, *taṇhakkhaya* (craving's destruction) *jināti sabbadukkhaṁ* (conquers all suffering)—connecting the chapter's theme with ultimate victory.

### Verse 355: Wealth's Danger

Riches destroy the foolish one
Who does not seek the way beyond.
Through craving for riches,
The fool destroys others and themselves.[21]

#### Footnotes

[21] **Hananti Bhogā Dummedhaṁ**: *Bhoga* (riches, possessions) *hananti* (destroy, kill) the *dummedha* (foolish, stupid). One who does not *pāragavesino* (seek the beyond, search for the further shore) is vulnerable to wealth's corruption. Through *bhogataṇhā* (craving for possessions), the fool *hanti* (destroys) *aññe* (others) and *attanaṁ* (themselves). Wealth itself is neutral; craving for wealth devastates.

### Verses 356-359: The Four Weeds

**Verse 356: Passion**

Fields are ruined by weeds;
These people are ruined by passion.
Therefore, great is the fruit
Of giving to those free from passion.[22]

**Verse 357: Hatred**

Fields are ruined by weeds;
These people are ruined by hatred.
Therefore, great is the fruit
Of giving to those free from hatred.[23]

**Verse 358: Delusion**

Fields are ruined by weeds;
These people are ruined by delusion.
Therefore, great is the fruit
Of giving to those free from delusion.[24]

**Verse 359: Desire**

Fields are ruined by weeds;
These people are ruined by desire.
Therefore, great is the fruit
Of giving to those free from desire.[25]

#### Footnotes

[22] **Rāgadosā**: *Tiṇa* (grass, weeds) ruins (*dosa*, here meaning "fault" or "ruin") *khettāni* (fields). Similarly, *rāga* (passion, lust) is the *dosa* (ruin, fault) of people. Therefore, *dinnaṁ* (what is given) to *vītarāga* (those free from passion) is *mahapphala* (of great fruit). The final four verses systematically identify what ruins beings and recommends giving to those who have overcome these faults.

[23] **Dosadosā**: *Dosa* (hatred, aversion) ruins beings as weeds ruin fields. Give to *vītadosa* (those free from hatred) for great fruit.

[24] **Mohadosā**: *Moha* (delusion, ignorance) is the third root of unwholesome action. Give to *vītamoha* (those free from delusion) for great fruit.

[25] **Icchādosā**: *Icchā* (desire, wish) parallels *taṇhā* but emphasizes wanting itself. Give to *vigaticchesu* (those without desire) for great fruit. These four verses connect merit-making (*dāna*) with the chapter's theme: support those who have overcome the very craving that imprisons ordinary beings.

### Historical Context

This chapter gathers teachings central to Buddhist soteriology. Verse 353's "All-Conquering, All-Wise" declaration reportedly represents the Buddha's first utterance after enlightenment, preserved in multiple canonical sources. Verse 354's "gift of Dhamma" hierarchy influenced Buddhist giving practices for millennia—supporting teachers over material offerings.
