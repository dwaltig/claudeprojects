# Chapter 5: Bālavagga (Fools)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Bālavagga

The fifth chapter addresses *bāla* (the fool)—one whose actions and attitudes obstruct spiritual progress. This isn't intellectual deficiency but willful ignorance, inability to learn from experience, and self-destructive behavior. The chapter pairs naturally with Chapter 6 (Paṇḍitavagga—The Wise), creating a contrast between those who advance and those who stagnate.

### Verse 60: Long is the Night

**Verse 60**

Long is the night for one awake;  
Long is a league for one exhausted;  
Long is the round of rebirths for fools  
Who know not the True Dhamma.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Three Lengths**: The verse builds from minor discomfort (sleepless night), to physical exhaustion (long journey), to existential tragedy (*saṁsāra*—endless rebirths). *Avijānataṁ* (not knowing) is key: the fool's suffering extends because they refuse the teaching that would end it. All sufferings feel long to those who lack liberating understanding.

### Verse 61: No Friendship with Fools

**Verse 61**

If while traveling one cannot find  
Someone better or equal to oneself,  
One should firmly resolve to go alone:  
There is no friendship with fools.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **Spiritual Solitude**: *Ekacariyaṁ daḷhaṁ kayirā* (firmly resolve to go alone) isn't arrogance but self-preservation. *Natthi bāle sahāyatā* (no friendship with fools) warns that bad companions drag one down. Better loneliness than corrupting companionship. This verse echoes the solitary elephant metaphor later (verse 330).

### Verse 62: Nothing Truly Ours

**Verse 62**

"Sons are mine, riches are mine"—  
So the fool suffers vexation.  
When even self is not one's own,  
How then sons? How then riches?[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **The Ownership Delusion**: The quoted speech captures the fool's claim: *puttā matthi, dhanam matthi* (sons are mine, riches are mine). But *attā hi attano natthi* (even self is not one's own)—Buddhism's radical challenge to possession. If the "I" that supposedly owns things is itself impermanent and ownerless, what can truly belong to it?

### Verse 63: Knowing One's Foolishness

**Verse 63**

A fool who knows his foolishness  
Is at least wise in that;  
But a fool proud of his wisdom—  
He is called a fool indeed.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **The Meta-Wisdom**: *Maññati bālyaṁ* (knows his foolishness) is the beginning of wisdom—recognizing ignorance. *Paṇḍitamānī* (proud of wisdom, thinking oneself wise) is the real danger: the fool who believes himself wise cannot learn. Socrates' insight echoes here: knowing one knows nothing is the start of knowledge.

### Verses 64-65: The Spoon and the Tongue

**Verse 64**

Even if a fool attends on a wise man  
For his entire life,  
He does not learn Dhamma—  
As a spoon learns not the taste of curry.

**Verse 65**

If a perceptive person attends on a wise man  
Even for a moment,  
He quickly learns Dhamma—  
As the tongue learns the taste of curry.[5]

#### Footnotes

[5] **The Famous Spoon Simile**: *Dabbī sūparasaṁ yathā* (as a spoon the taste of curry)—despite constant immersion in curry, the spoon never tastes it. Mere proximity to wisdom means nothing without receptivity. *Viññū* (the perceptive one) contrasts with *bālo* (fool): capacity to learn (*vijānāti*) determines results, not duration of exposure.

### Verse 66: Self-Enmity

**Verse 66**

Stupid fools live with themselves as their own enemies,  
Committing wicked deeds  
That produce bitter fruit.[6]

#### Footnotes

[6] **Self-Sabotage**: *Amitteneva attanā* (with themselves as enemy) captures the fool's tragedy—their worst enemy is not external but internal. Every *pāpakaṁ kammaṁ* (wicked deed) generates *kaṭukapphala* (bitter fruit). The fool attacks themselves through their own actions.

---

### Verses 67-68: Regret and Relief

**Verse 67**

That deed is not well done  
Which, having done, one regrets—  
For which one has tears on one's face  
As the result follows round.

**Verse 68**

That deed is well done  
Which, having done, one does not regret—  
For which one is pleased and happy  
As the result follows round.[7]

#### Footnotes

[7] **Internal Criterion**: This twin-verse pair offers a practical test: *anutappati* (regret) marks bad deeds; *nānutappati* (no regret) marks good ones. *Vipākaṁ paṭisevati* (the result follows round)—karma's consequences pursue us. The tearful face versus the happy heart measure our actions' quality.

---

### Verse 69: Sweet Until Ripening

**Verse 69**

The fool thinks (wickedness) is sweet  
As long as it does not ripen;  
But when the wicked deed ripens,  
The fool undergoes suffering.[8]

#### Footnotes

[8] **Delayed Consequences**: *Madhuvā maññati* (thinks it sweet)—evil feels pleasurable before results manifest. *Paccati* (ripens, cooks) is the key verb: karma ripens like fruit, ferments like wine. The initial sweetness is deceptive; the fool doesn't see the bitterness coming.

### Verse 70: Asceticism Without Understanding

**Verse 70**

Month by month the fool may eat  
With the tip of kusa grass;  
Yet he is not worth a sixteenth part  
Of those who have understood Dhamma.[9]

#### Footnotes

[9] **Austerity Versus Insight**: *Kusaggena* (with the tip of kusa grass) refers to extreme fasting—an ascetic practice eating almost nothing. But *saṅkhātadhamma* (those who have mastered/understood Dhamma) are *soḷasī* (sixteen times) more valuable. This verse attacks asceticism without wisdom: mere physical discipline without insight achieves nothing.

---

### Verse 71: Fire Under Ashes

**Verse 71**

A wicked deed once done  
Does not curdle at once, like milk.  
Smoldering, it follows the fool  
Like fire covered with ashes.[10]

#### Footnotes

[10] **Hidden Combustion**: Two images: milk doesn't turn instantly (*sajju khīraṁ va muccati*), and fire smoldering under ashes (*bhasmacchanno va pāvako*). Both capture karma's delayed action—evil seems dormant but is slowly ripening, quietly burning, waiting to consume. *Ḍahanta* (smoldering) emphasizes the hidden danger.

---

### Verses 72-75: Learning That Destroys

**Verse 72**

Whatever learning arises for a fool,  
It is only to his disadvantage—  
It destroys his good fortune  
And destroys his head.[11]

#### Footnotes

[11] **Dangerous Knowledge**: *Ñattaṁ* (learning, knowledge) in wrong hands becomes destructive. *Anatthāya* (to disadvantage) inverts knowledge's purpose. *Muddham-assa vipātayaṁ* (destroys his head) suggests both literal danger and metaphorical downfall. Misused learning is worse than ignorance.

### Verses 73-74: The Fool's Desires

**Verses 73-74**

He may wish for undeserved respect,  
Status among monastics,  
Control in living quarters,  
Worship from good families:

"Householders and renunciants alike  
Should think this was done by me;  
Let them all be under my sway  
In matters done and not done."

So thinks the fool—  
His desires and conceit only increase.[12]

#### Footnotes

[12] **Spiritual Materialism**: These verses expose the fool in monastic robes. *Asataṁ bhāvana* (respect that is lacking/undeserved), *purekkhāra* (status), *issariya* (control)—all worldly ambitions dressed in spiritual clothing. *Icchā māno ca vaḍḍhati* (desires and conceit increase)—the opposite of genuine progress.

---

### Verse 75: Two Paths

**Verse 75**

The means to gains is one thing;  
The path to Nibbāna, another.  
Understanding this, the Buddha's monastic disciple  
Should not delight in honors  
But cultivate solitude.[13]

#### Footnotes

[13] **Definitive Distinction**: *Lābhūpanisā* (means to gains) versus *Nibbānagāminī* (path going to Nibbāna)—two entirely different directions. *Sakkāraṁ nābhinandeyya* (should not delight in honors) prescribes renunciation of prestige. *Vivekam-anubrūhaye* (cultivate solitude) offers the alternative: not worldly success but meditative seclusion.

**End of Bālavagga (Chapter 5)**
