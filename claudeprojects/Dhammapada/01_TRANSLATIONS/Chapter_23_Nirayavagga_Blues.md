# Chapter 22: Nirayavagga - Blues Edition
## Hell: The Underworld Awaits the Unwary

---

## Opening Words

This chapter's about HELL. Not as a place outside you, but as the destination you CREATE through your actions. The Buddha's not trying to scare you—he's trying to WAKE you up. Every action has consequences. Some consequences take you down, down, down. Better to know that NOW than find out later.

### Verse 306: Liars Go to Hell

**The Blues Truth:**

The one who speaks FALSELY—  
Who says what isn't so—  
Goes to the underworld.

And the one who says "I didn't do it"  
When he DID?  
Same destination, friend.

Both of them, when they pass on,  
End up in the same place—  
The hereafter that receives  
Those who did base deeds.

Lying about truth,  
Lying about your actions—  
Both roads lead DOWN.

**Blues Notes:** *Abhūtavādī* means speaking what is untrue. *Nirayaṁ* is the underworld, the hell realm. The Buddha equates these two types of lying because both corrupt truth.

### Verse 307: The Robe Doesn't Save You

**The Blues Truth:**

MANY wear the monastic robe  
Around their necks—  
But they're wicked inside.  
Unrestrained. Living foul.

You think that cloth protects you?  
You think that title saves you?

Through wicked deeds,  
The wicked re-arise  
In the underworld.

The robe is just CLOTH,  
If the heart is still poison.

**Blues Notes:** *Kāsāvakaṇṭhā*—wearing the robe around the neck. This is a direct warning to monastics, but it applies to anyone who thinks religious garb or titles protect them from their own actions.

### Verse 308: Better to Eat a Glowing Iron Ball

**The Blues Truth:**

LISTEN—  
It's BETTER to swallow  
A glowing iron ball,  
Hot as fire's flame,

Than to enjoy the almsfood of the land  
Without virtue,  
Without restraint.

You hear that?  
A burning metal ball in your belly  
Is BETTER than living off others' generosity  
While being a hypocrite.

That's how serious this is.  
Don't play at holiness  
While acting foul inside.

**Blues Notes:** *Ayoguḷo bhutto tatto*—having eaten a glowing iron ball. This shocking image drives home the point: false holiness is worse than physical torture. The karmic consequences are THAT severe.

### Verses 309-310: The Four Results of Adultery

**The Blues Truth:**

You heedless man,  
Chasing after someone else's partner—  
Here's what you get.  
FOUR states waiting:

ONE: Demerit.  
Bad karma stacking up.

TWO: An uncomfortable bed.  
No peace when you lie down.

THREE: Blame.  
People know. They talk.

FOUR: The underworld.  
Where you end up reborn.

And what did you get?  
Only the small, fearful pleasure  
Of a scared man with a scared woman.  
Kings apply heavy punishment.  
Society condemns you.

Was it worth it?  
A man should NOT consort  
With another's wife.

**Blues Notes:** *Paradārūpasevī*—one who consorts with another's wife. The Buddha lists the practical AND karmic consequences. This isn't moralizing—it's cause and effect.

### Verses 311-313: The Ascetic Life Wrongly Grasped

**The Blues Truth:**

KUSHA GRASS—  
You know the jagged kind?  
Grab it wrong, and it CUTS your hand.  
Blood everywhere.

The ascetic life is the same.  
Grab it wrong,  
Practice it wrong,  
And it DRAGS you down to hell.

A lax deed?  
A defiled vow?  
A holy life that's doubtful?  
NAH—that ain't bearing great fruit.

If you're gonna do this thing,  
DO IT RIGHT.  
Be FIRM in your effort.  
The wanderer who's lax  
Just spreads impurity everywhere.

Don't be that guy.  
Either practice properly  
Or don't pretend at all.

**Blues Notes:** *Kuso yathā duggahito*—like kusha grass wrongly grasped. The image is vivid: spiritual practice is like a sharp blade. Handle it right, it cuts through delusion. Handle it wrong, it cuts YOU.

### Verse 314: Better Undone is a Wrong-Doing

**The Blues Truth:**

Here's wisdom in two lines:

**BETTER UNDONE is a wrong-doing—**  
'Cause that wrong-doing is gonna BURN you later.  
You'll regret it. You'll suffer.  
Leave it undone.

**BETTER DONE is what's well-done—**  
'Cause that good deed brings no regret.  
You did right, and it sits right.  
Do that instead.

Simple calculus, baby.  
Wrong → regret.  
Right → no regret.  
Make your choice.

**Blues Notes:** *Akataṁ dukkataṁ seyyo*—better undone is wrong-doing. *Katañ-ca sukataṁ seyyo*—better done is well-doing. The Buddha's giving you a decision framework for every action.

### Verse 315: Guard Yourself Like a Border Town

**The Blues Truth:**

You know how they guard a border town?  
INSIDE and OUTSIDE.  
Watching every approach.  
Nothing gets past without notice.

That's how you should watch over YOURSELF.  
Guard the gates of your senses.  
Watch what comes in.  
Watch what goes out.

And don't let the MOMENT pass—  
Don't let the chance slip by.  
'Cause when the chance is gone,  
They GRIEVE.  
Consigned to the underworld,  
They grieve.

This moment is IT.  
Right here.  
Guard it like your life depends on it.  
Because it does.

**Blues Notes:** *Nagaraṁ yathā paccantaṁ*—like a border town. *Khaṇo vo mā upaccagā*—don't let the moment pass you by. Urgency combined with vigilance.

### Verses 316-318: Wrong Views Lead to Bad Destiny

**The Blues Truth:**

Here's how you end up in a bad place:

**ASHAMED of what's not shameful,  
NOT ashamed of what IS shameful—**  
Wrong views. Bad destiny.

**SEEING FEAR in what's not fearful,  
NOT SEEING FEAR in what IS fearful—**  
Wrong views. Bad destiny.

**FINDING BLAME in what's blameless,  
NOT SEEING BLAME in what IS blameable—**  
Wrong views. Bad destiny.

Three ways to get it backwards.  
Three ways to walk into hell  
With your eyes wide open.

Your VIEW determines your destination.  
Get the view wrong,  
And you'll get lost  
In all the wrong places.

**Blues Notes:** *Micchādiṭṭhisamādānā*—undertaking wrong views. This phrase repeats three times, emphasizing that VIEW is foundational. Wrong view doesn't just affect philosophy—it determines where you end up.

---

### Verse 319: Right Views Lead to Good Destiny

**The Blues Truth:**

But HERE'S how to go RIGHT:

**KNOWING blame in what's blameable,**  
**And NO blame in what's blameless—**

Right views.  
Good destiny.

That's it.  
See clearly what deserves criticism.  
See clearly what doesn't.  
Don't get it twisted.

Undertake RIGHT views,  
And beings go to a GOOD destiny.

Same principle—  
Just turned around.  
View makes the path.  
Path makes the destination.

**Blues Notes:** *Sammādiṭṭhisamādānā*—undertaking right views. This is the flip side. The whole chapter builds to this: it's not about fear of hell, it's about CLARITY of view.

4. Adultery brings: demerit, no peace, blame, and hell
5. The ascetic life wrongly grasped drags you DOWN
6. Be firm in effort—lax practice spreads impurity
7. Better UNDONE is a wrong-doing; better DONE is a right-doing
8. Guard yourself like a border town—inside and outside
9. Don't let the moment pass—or grieve in hell later
