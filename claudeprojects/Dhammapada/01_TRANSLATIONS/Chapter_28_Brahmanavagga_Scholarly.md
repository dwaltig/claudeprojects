# Chapter 28: Brāhmaṇavagga (The Brahmin)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Brāhmaṇavagga

The twenty-eighth and final chapter of this reconstructed Dhammapada (formerly the core of Chapter 26) redefines *brāhmaṇa* (brahmin). Having established the nature of Nibbāna in the previous chapter, the text now turns to the practical embodiment of that state in the world. The Buddha systematically dismantles caste-based claims, insisting that true nobility is defined by ethical purity, wisdom, and the "dropping off" of defilements like mustard seeds from a needle point.

### Verse 387: Radiance Compared

The sun shines by day, the moon glows by night,
The warrior shines in armor,
The brahmin shines in meditation—
But the Buddha shines with radiance all day and night.[5]

#### Footnotes

[5] **Divā Tapati Ādicco**: A graduated comparison: *ādicca* (sun) *tapati* (shines) *divā* (by day); *candimā* (moon) *ābhāti* (glows) *rattiṁ* (at night); *khattiya* (warrior/noble) shines *sannaddho* (armored, equipped); *brāhmaṇa jhāyī* (meditating brahmin) shines. But *Buddha tapati tejasā* (Buddha shines with power/brilliance) *sabbam-ahorattiṁ* (all day and night). The Buddha's radiance is unconditional, continuous, supreme.

### Verse 388: Etymology of Names

Warding off wickedness, one is called "brahmin."
Living austerely, one is called "ascetic."
Driving forth one's own stain—
Therefore one is called "one gone forth."[6]

#### Footnotes

[6] **Bāhitapāpo ti Brāhmaṇo**: The Buddha offers folk etymologies: *brāhmaṇa* derives from *bāhita-pāpa* (one who has warded off evil); *samaṇa* (ascetic) from *samacariyā* (living evenly, austerely); *pabbajita* (one gone forth, renunciant) from *pabbājayaṁ malaṁ* (driving forth stain). These are spiritual etymologies—the terms' true meanings depend on qualities, not caste.

### Verses 389-390: Non-Violence

**Verse 389**

A brahmin should not strike a brahmin,
Nor should the brahmin retaliate.
Woe to one who strikes a brahmin!
Greater woe to one who retaliates![7]

**Verse 390**

It is no small good for a brahmin
When the mind turns back from what is dear,
Whenever the harmful mind turns back—
There is calming of suffering.[8]

#### Footnotes

[7] **Na Brāhmaṇassa Pahareyya**: True brahmins should neither attack (*pahareyya*) nor retaliate when attacked (*muñcetha*). *Dhī* (woe, shame) falls on both striker and retaliator—but *tato dhī* (greater shame) on the one who strikes back. Non-retaliation is the higher virtue.

[8] **Nisedho Manaso Piyehi**: When the *mano* (mind) achieves *nisedha* (restraint, withdrawal) from *piyehi* (dear things, attachments), and *hiṁsamano* (the harmful mind) *nivattati* (turns back), then *sammati dukkhaṁ* (suffering is calmed). Mental discipline, not external observance, defines brahminhood.

### Verse 391: Three Restraints

One for whom there is no wrongdoing
Through body, speech, or mind,
Restrained in these three—
That one I call a brahmin.[9]

#### Footnotes

[9] **Kāyena Vācāya Manasā Natthi Dukkata​ṁ**: The three doors of action—*kāya* (body), *vācā* (speech), *manas* (mind)—produce no *dukkata* (wrongdoing). *Saṁvuta tīhi ṭhānehi* (restrained in three places) describes complete behavioral purity.

---

### Verse 392: Honor the Teacher

From whomever one learned the Dhamma
Taught by the Perfectly Awakened One—
One should respectfully bow to them
As a brahmin bows at the fire-sacrifice.[10]

#### Footnotes

[10] **Sakkaccaṁ Taṁ Namasseyya**: One who teaches *Dhammaṁ* (truth) *Sammāsambuddhadesitaṁ* (taught by the Fully Self-Awakened One) deserves *namasseyya* (homage) *sakkaccaṁ* (respectfully). The simile is pointed: as brahmins bow (*aggihuttaṁ va*) at fire-sacrifice (their central ritual), so should one bow to the Dhamma-teacher. Spiritual teaching surpasses ritual in worthiness of reverence.

### Verses 393-394: Not by Externals

**Verse 393**

Not by matted hair, not by clan,
Not by birth is one a brahmin.
In whom there is truth and Dhamma—
That one is pure, that one is truly brahmin.[11]

**Verse 394**

What use your matted hair, O fool?
What use your deerskin garment?
Within you is a jungle—
You polish only the outside![12]

#### Footnotes

[11] **Na Jaṭāhi Na Gottena**: Neither *jaṭā* (matted hair—ascetic marker), *gotta* (clan, lineage), nor *jaccā* (birth) makes a *brāhmaṇa*. Only one *yamhi saccañ-ca Dhammo ca* (in whom truth and Dhamma exist) is *sucī* (pure) and genuinely brahmin. This directly challenges Brahmanical claims to inherited holiness.

[12] **Kiṁ Te Jaṭāhi Dummedha**: The *dummedha* (fool, idiot) cultivates *jaṭā* (matted locks) and wears *ajinasāṭī* (deerskin garment)—external ascetic signs. But *abbhantara* (within) is *gahaṇa* (jungle, thicket)—tangled defilements. *Bāhira parimajjasi* (you polish the outside)—superficial spirituality that neglects inner work.

---

### Verse 395: True Austerity

One wearing discarded cloth,
Lean, with veins visible,
Meditating alone in the forest—
That one I call a brahmin.[13]

#### Footnotes

[13] **Paṁsukūladharaṁ Jantuṁ**: Yet external simplicity combined with genuine practice *is* praise-worthy: *paṁsukūla* (rag-robes, discarded cloth) *dhara* (wearing); *kisa* (lean, thin); *dhamanisanthata* (with tendons/veins spread, visible—from austerity); *eka vanasmiṁ jhāyanta* (meditating alone in forest). The difference from verse 394: here external simplicity accompanies inner practice, not masks its absence.

---

### Verse 396: Not by Birth

I do not call one a brahmin
Merely because of birth from a womb.
That one is just one who says "bho" if attached.
Having nothing, unattached—
That one I call a brahmin.[14]

#### Footnotes

[14] **Na Cāhaṁ Brāhmaṇaṁ Brūmi Yonijaṁ**: The Buddha explicitly rejects *yonija* (womb-born) and *mattisambhava* (mother-originated) as criteria. One with such birth may be merely *bhovādī* (one who says "bho"—the familiar address used *to* brahmins, implying pretension) *sace sakiñcana* (if attached, if possessing). Only *akiñcana* (possessing nothing) and *anādāna* (unattached) qualifies.

---

### Verse 397: Cutting Fetters

Whoever has cut all fetters,
Who surely does not tremble,
Who has surmounted attachments, detached—
That one I call a brahmin.[15]

#### Footnotes

[15] **Sabbasaṁyojanaṁ Chetvā**: *Saṁyojana* (fetters—the ten bonds to existence) *chetvā* (having cut) produces *na paritassati* (no trembling, no anxiety). *Saṅgātiga* (surmounted attachments), *visaṁyutta* (detached)—these are true brahminical qualities.

---

### Verse 398: The Symbolic Bonds

Having cut the thong, the strap,
The rope together with the bridle,
Having thrown off the bolt, awakened—
That one I call a brahmin.[16]

#### Footnotes

[16] **Chetvā Naddhiṁ Varattañ-ca**: A series of bondage metaphors: *naddhi* (thong = hatred), *varattā* (strap = craving), *sandāna* (rope = wrong views), *saha anukkamaṁ* (with bridle = latent tendencies). *Ukkhittapaligha* (thrown off the bolt = ignorance). *Buddha* (awakened) describes the result. This verse decodes spiritual bondage through material imagery.

---

### Verse 399: Patient Endurance

Whoever, being pure, endures
Abuse, imprisonment, and beatings,
With patience as their strength,
With an army of strength—
That one I call a brahmin.[17]

#### Footnotes

[17] **Akkosaṁ Vadhabandhañ-ca Aduṭṭho Titikkhati**: *Akkosa* (abuse), *vadha* (beating), *bandha* (imprisonment)—all *titikkhati* (endures) *aduṭṭha* (without hostility, being pure). Their *bala* (strength) is *khanti* (patience); they possess *balānīka* (an army of strength). Endurance under persecution proves brahminhood.

---

### Verse 400: Trained and Final

Without anger, dutiful,
Virtuous, without swelling,
Trained, in their final body—
That one I call a brahmin.[18]

#### Footnotes

[18] **Akkodhanaṁ Vatavantaṁ**: *Akkodhana* (without anger), *vatavanta* (possessing vows, dutiful), *sīlavanta* (virtuous), *anussuta* (without leakage, taint-free), *danta* (trained, tamed), *antimasārīra* (in final body—no more rebirth)—the complete arahant.

---

### Verse 401: Like Water on Lotus

Like water on a lotus leaf,
Like a mustard seed on a needle tip—
One who does not cling to pleasures—
That one I call a brahmin.[19]

#### Footnotes

[19] **Vāri Pokkharapatte va**: Two similes for non-attachment: *vāri* (water) on *pokkharapatta* (lotus leaf)—doesn't adhere, rolls off; *sāsapa* (mustard seed) on *āragge* (needle point)—cannot remain. One who similarly *na lippati kāmesu* (is not smeared/doesn't cling to pleasures) is brahmin.

---

### Verse 402: Knowing Suffering's End

Whoever knows right here
The destruction of their own suffering,
Having put down the burden, detached—
That one I call a brahmin.[20]

#### Footnotes

[20] **Yo Dukkhassa Pajānāti Idh'eva Khayam-attano**: One who *pajānāti* (knows, understands) *khaya* (destruction, ending) of *dukkha* (suffering) *idheva* (right here, in this very life). *Pannabhāra* (put down burden), *visaṁyutta* (detached)—present liberation, not merely future hope.

---

### Verse 403: Deep Wisdom

The deeply wise, sagacious,
Skilled in what is path and non-path,
Having reached the highest goal—
That one I call a brahmin.[21]

#### Footnotes

[21] **Gambhīrapaññaṁ Medhāviṁ**: *Gambhīra-paññā* (deep wisdom), *medhāvin* (sagacious, intelligent), *kovida* (skilled) in *magga-amagga* (path and non-path—knowing what leads to liberation and what doesn't). Having *anuppatta uttamattha* (reached the highest purpose).

---

### Verse 404: Non-Mixing

One who doesn't mix with householders or the homeless,
Wandering without abode, with few desires—
That one I call a brahmin.[22]

#### Footnotes

[22] **Asaṁsaṭṭhaṁ Gahaṭṭhehi Anāgārehi Cūbhayaṁ**: Not *saṁsaṭṭha* (mixing, associating closely) with either *gahaṭṭha* (householders) or *anāgāra* (homeless ones/monks). *Anokasārin* (wandering without stable abode), *appiccha* (of few desires)—the thoroughly independent practitioner.

---

### Verse 405: Non-Violence

Having laid down the stick
Against beings both fearful and fearless,
Who neither hurts nor kills—
That one I call a brahmin.[23]

#### Footnotes

[23] **Nidhāya Daṇḍaṁ Bhūtesu**: *Daṇḍa* (stick, violence) *nidhāya* (laid down, put aside) toward *bhūtesu* (living beings)—both *tasa* (trembling, mobile) and *thāvara* (still, stationary). *Na hanti* (doesn't hurt), *na ghāteti* (doesn't kill)—complete *ahiṁsā*.

---

### Verse 406: Friendly Amid Hostility

Friendly among the hostile,
Calm among those with raised sticks,
Unattached among the attached—
That one I call a brahmin.[24]

#### Footnotes

[24] **Aviruddhaṁ Viruddhesu**: *Aviruddha* (friendly, non-hostile) *viruddhesu* (among hostile ones); *nibbuta* (calm, cooled) *attadaṇḍesu* (among those with raised sticks, the violent); *anādāna* (unattached) *sādānesu* (among the attached). The brahmin maintains equanimity regardless of context.

---

### Verse 407: Dropping Defilements

Whoever has let fall passion and hatred,
Conceit and contempt,
Like a mustard seed from a needle tip—
That one I call a brahmin.[25]

#### Footnotes

[25] **Yassa Rāgo ca Doso ca Māno Makkho ca Pātito**: *Rāga* (passion), *dosa* (hatred), *māna* (conceit), *makkha* (contempt, hypocrisy)—all *pātita* (dropped, fallen away). The simile repeats: *sāsapo āraggā* (mustard seed from needle)—these cannot hold on; they naturally fall.

---

### Verse 408: True Speech

Whoever speaks words of truth,
Informed and not harsh,
Through which no one is angered—
That one I call a brahmin.[26]

#### Footnotes

[26] **Akakkasaṁ Viññapaniṁ Giraṁ Saccaṁ Udīraye**: Speech (*girā*) that is *sacca* (true), *viññapanī* (informative, clear), *akakkasa* (not harsh). *Yāya nābhisaje kañci* (through which no one is angered)—speech that communicates truth without provocation.

---

### Verse 409: Not Taking

Whoever in this world takes not what is not given—
Whether long, short, small, large,
Pleasant or unpleasant—
That one I call a brahmin.[27]

#### Footnotes

[27] **Loke Adinnaṁ Nādiyati**: *Adinna* (not given) *nādiyati* (does not take)—the second precept perfectly observed. The list (*dīgha, rassa, aṇu, thūla, subha, asubha*) covers all objects: nothing taken that isn't freely offered.

---

### Verse 410: No Longings

One who has no longings
In this world or in the next,
Without hope, detached—
That one I call a brahmin.[28]

#### Footnotes

[28] **Āsā Yassa na Vijjanti**: *Āsā* (longing, hope, expectation) *na vijjanti* (does not exist) for either *imaṁ loka* (this world) or *para* (the next). *Nirāsaya* (without hope/refuge), *visaṁyutta* (detached)—transcending even longing for heavenly rebirth.

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Key Concepts

1. **Redefining Brahminhood**: Spiritual status through realization, not birth—Buddhism's caste critique
2. **Tam-ahaṁ Brūmi Brāhmaṇaṁ**: The refrain establishing personal authority to define holiness
3. **Liberation Markers**: Detachment, extinction of pollutants, knowledge of former lives
4. **External vs. Internal**: Matted hair meaningless; inner transformation essential
5. **Akataññū**: Knower of the uncreated/unconditioned—nibbāna as goal

### Cross-References

- **Tevijja Sutta (DN 13)**: Buddha's debate with brahmins about true brahminhood
- **Assalāyana Sutta (MN 93)**: Extended critique of caste-birth claims
- **Vāseṭṭha Sutta (MN 98)**: "Not by birth is one an outcaste, not by birth is one a brahmin"
- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 12**: Devadatta chapter likewise challenges birth-based status

### Historical Context

This chapter represents one of Buddhism's earliest and most sustained challenges to the Indian caste system. The Buddha's redefinition of brahminhood infuriated traditional brahmins while inspiring countless practitioners who found in Buddhism a path open regardless of birth. The forty-one fold *tam-ahaṁ brūmi* refrain creates a definitive portrait against which all claims to holiness could be measured—not lineage, not ritual, not external marks, but wisdom and liberation.
