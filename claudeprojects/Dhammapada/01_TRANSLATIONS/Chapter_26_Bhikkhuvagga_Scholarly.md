# Chapter 25: Bhikkhuvagga (The Monk)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Bhikkhuvagga

The twenty-fifth chapter addresses the *bhikkhu*—the Buddhist monk or mendicant—describing the qualities, practices, and attainments that constitute authentic monasticism. The term *bhikkhu* derives from the root meaning "to beg" or "to share," indicating the almsman who depends on householder support while dedicating themselves fully to spiritual practice.

This chapter presents a comprehensive portrait of the ideal monk: restrained in all senses, controlled in body and speech, content with little, devoted to meditation, dwelling in loving-kindness, and ultimately attaining the deathless. It pairs practical instruction (sense-restraint, contentment, spiritual friendship) with philosophical insight (the relationship between concentration and wisdom, the superhuman delight of insight).

The chapter's recurring theme is *saṁvara* (restraint)—a disciplined self-governance that paradoxically leads to freedom. The monk restrained everywhere becomes liberated everywhere.

### Verses 360-361: Universal Restraint

**Verse 360**

Restraint of the eye is good;
Restraint of the ear is good;
Restraint of the nose is good;
Restraint of the tongue is good.

**Verse 361**

Restraint of the body is good;
Restraint of speech is good;
Restraint of mind is good;
Restraint everywhere is good.
The monk restrained everywhere
Is liberated from all suffering.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Saṁvaro Sādhu**: The word *sādhu* (good, excellent, well-done) punctuates each line, creating a litany of affirmation. *Saṁvara* (restraint, self-control) is applied to each sense faculty: *cakkhu* (eye), *sota* (ear), *ghāṇa* (nose), *jivhā* (tongue), *kāya* (body), *vācā* (speech), *manas* (mind). The culmination: *sabbattha saṁvuto bhikkhu* (the monk restrained everywhere) *sabbadukkhā pamuccati* (is liberated from all suffering). Note the progression from individual senses to totality—and the promise that comprehensive restraint produces comprehensive liberation.

### Verse 362: The True Monk

One who controls their hands, controls their feet,
Controls their speech, controls the mind supreme,
With inner delight and composure,
Solitary, content—that one is called a monk.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **Saṁyatuttamo**: *Saṁyata* (controlled, restrained) governs *hattha* (hands), *pāda* (feet), *vācā* (speech), and ultimately the *uttama* (supreme)—the mind itself. Such a one is *ajjhattarata* (delighting inwardly), *samāhita* (composed, concentrated), *eka* (alone, solitary), and *santusita* (content). The verse describes not external observance but internal transformation: true monasticism is defined by inner state, not merely outer renunciation.

---

### Verse 363: Sweet Speech

The monk who restrains the mouth,
Who speaks thoughtfully, who is modest,
Who explains the meaning and the Dhamma—
Sweet is their speech.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Mukhasaṁyato Bhikkhu**: *Mukha* (mouth) *saṁyata* (restrained) applies both to eating and speaking. *Mantabhāṇī* (speaking thoughtfully, speaking mantras/measured words) and *anuddhata* (modest, not puffed up) characterize their communication. When they *dīpeti* (illuminate, explain) *atthaṁ Dhammañ-ca* (meaning and Dhamma), their *bhāsita* (speech) is *madhura* (sweet, pleasant). Speech restraint doesn't mean silence but thoughtful, meaningful, beneficial communication.

---

### Verse 364: Dhamma-Delight

One who finds pleasure in the Dhamma,
Who delights in the Dhamma,
Who reflects on the Dhamma,
Who recollects the Dhamma—
That monk does not fall away from the True Dhamma.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **Dhammārāmo Dhammarato**: Three Dhamma-relations are enumerated: *ārāma* (pleasure garden, finding pleasure in), *rata* (delighting in), and *anuvicintayaṁ* (reflecting on, thinking about). When one also *anussaraṁ* (recollects, remembers) Dhamma, they *na parihāyati* (do not fall away from) *Saddhammā* (True/Good Dhamma). The repetition of "Dhamma" four times emphasizes complete immersion in the teaching.

### Verses 365-366: Contentment with Gains

**Verse 365**

One should not despise one's own gains,
Nor live envious of others.
The monk envious of others
Does not attain concentration.[5]

**Verse 366**

Even if a monk gains little,
They should not despise their gains.
The gods themselves praise
One of pure livelihood who is diligent.[6]

#### Footnotes

[5] **Salābhaṁ Nātimaññeyya**: *Salābha* (one's own gains—alms, offerings, supports) should not be *atimaññeyya* (despised, looked down upon). Nor should one *pihayaṁ care* (live enviously) regarding *aññesaṁ* (others' gains). Why? The *bhikkhu pihayaṁ* (envious monk) *nādhigacchati samādhiṁ* (does not attain concentration). Envy disturbs the tranquil mind required for deep practice.

[6] **Devā Pasaṁsanti**: Even *appalābha* (one of little gain) who doesn't despise their modest portion receives praise from *devā* (gods, celestial beings). *Suddhājīvin* (one of pure livelihood) who is *atandita* (diligent, unwearied) merits celestial approval. The teaching counters material comparison: spiritual success isn't measured by alms received.

### Verse 367: Non-Fondness

One who has no possessive fondness at all
For mind-and-body,
Who grieves not for what does not exist—
That one is truly called a monk.[7]

#### Footnotes

[7] **Sabbaso Nāmarūpasmiṁ**: *Nāmarūpa* (name-and-form, mind-and-body) encompasses the totality of psychophysical existence. One who has *natthi mamāyitaṁ* (no "mine-making," no possessive attachment) *sabbaso* (completely, in every way) regarding this, and who *na socati* (does not grieve) *asatā ca* (for what does not exist, for what is absent)—is *ve bhikkhū ti vuccati* (truly called a monk). The verse describes non-attachment to both present existence and absent objects.

---

### Verse 368: Loving-Kindness and Peace

The monk who dwells in loving-kindness,
With faith in the Buddha's teaching,
Should attain the state of peace—
The bliss of stilling all conditions.[8]

#### Footnotes

[8] **Mettāvihārī**: *Mettā* (loving-kindness) as *vihāra* (dwelling, abode) describes the pervading mental state. Combined with *pasanna* (clear faith) in *Buddhasāsana* (Buddha's teaching), such a monk *adhigacche* (should attain) *padaṁ santaṁ* (the peaceful state)—specifically, *saṅkhārūpasamaṁ sukhaṁ* (the bliss of calming/stilling *saṅkhāra*, conditioned phenomena). This names nibbāna in positive terms: not mere cessation but blissful peace.

---

### Verse 369: Bailing the Boat

Bail out this boat, O monk!
When bailed, it will go swiftly.
Having cut off passion and hatred,
From there you will reach Nibbāna.[9]

#### Footnotes

[9] **Siñca Bhikkhu Imaṁ Nāvaṁ**: The self is compared to a *nāvā* (boat) requiring *siñca* (bailing out). Unbailed, water (defilements) makes the boat heavy and slow; *sittā* (when bailed) it *lahuṁ essati* (will go lightly, swiftly). The defilements to remove: *rāga* (passion) and *dosa* (hatred). Having *chetvā* (cut) these, *tato Nibbānam-ehisi* (from there you will go to Nibbāna). The nautical metaphor is apt: the spiritual journey requires continuous maintenance.

### Verse 370: The Fives

Cut off five, abandon five,
Cultivate five more.
The monk who surmounts five attachments
Is called "one who has crossed the flood."[10]

#### Footnotes

[10] **Pañca Chinde, Pañca Jahe, Pañca Cuttaribhāvaye**: This numerical verse requires commentary to decode. Traditional interpretation: *chinde pañca* (cut five) = five lower fetters (self-view, doubt, rites-attachment, sensual desire, ill-will); *jahe pañca* (abandon five) = five higher fetters (form-attachment, formless-attachment, conceit, restlessness, ignorance); *bhāvaye pañca uttari* (cultivate five more) = five spiritual faculties (faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom). One who *atigo pañca saṅgā* (surmounts five attachments—passion, hatred, delusion, pride, wrong views) is *oghatiṇṇa* (flood-crosser)—the four floods being sensuality, existence, views, and ignorance.

---

### Verse 371: Meditate and Beware

Meditate, O monk! Be not heedless!
Let not your mind swirl in strands of desire.
Heedless, do not swallow the hot iron ball.
Burning, do not cry "This is suffering!"[11]

#### Footnotes

[11] **Jhāya Bhikkhu Mā ca Pāmado**: *Jhāya* (meditate, practice jhāna) and *mā pāmado* (be not heedless)—direct imperatives. *Kāmaguṇe* (strands of sense-desire) should not *bhamassu cittaṁ* (swirl/whirl the mind). The *lohaguḷa* (iron ball) is *gilī* (swallowed) by the *pamatto* (heedless one)—a reference to hell-realm suffering where beings swallow molten iron. The verse ends dramatically: don't wait to cry *dukkham-idaṁ* while *ḍayhamāno* (burning). Practice now; prevent suffering rather than lamenting it later.

---

### Verse 372: Concentration and Wisdom

There is no concentration for one without wisdom;
There is no wisdom for one without concentration.
One who has both concentration and wisdom—
That one is indeed near Nibbāna.[12]

#### Footnotes

[12] **Natthi Jhānaṁ Apaññassa**: This frequently-quoted verse establishes the interdependence of *jhāna* (concentration, meditative absorption) and *paññā* (wisdom, insight). Neither exists without the other; they mutually support and develop together. One who possesses *jhānañ-ca paññā ca* (both) is *Nibbānasantike* (in Nibbāna's presence/vicinity). This teaching counters both anti-intellectual mysticism and dry scholasticism—liberation requires united practice.

---

### Verse 373: Superhuman Delight

For one who has entered an empty place,
A monk with peaceful mind,
There is superhuman delight
When rightly seeing the Dhamma.[13]

#### Footnotes

[13] **Suññāgāraṁ Paviṭṭhassa**: *Suññāgāra* (empty dwelling, empty place) describes the monk's retreat environment. With *santacitta* (peaceful mind), they experience *amānusī ratī* (superhuman, beyond-human delight) when *sammā vipassato Dhammaṁ* (rightly seeing, insight-perceiving the Dhamma). The joy of insight transcends ordinary pleasure—it is literally not-human, belonging to a higher order of experience.

---

### Verse 374: Joy in Impermanence

Whoever rightly attends to
The rise and fall of the aggregates
Gains joy and happiness—
That is the deathless for one who knows.[14]

#### Footnotes

[14] **Khandhānaṁ Udayabbayaṁ**: *Sammasati* (thoroughly attends to, contemplates) the *udaya* (arising) and *vaya* (passing away) of *khandhā* (the five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, formations, consciousness). Such contemplation *labhatī* (obtains) *pīti* (joy, rapture) and *pāmojja* (happiness, gladness). This is *amata* (the deathless, the immortal)—nibbāna—*vijānataṁ* (for those who know). The insight into impermanence produces not depression but liberation-joy.

---

### Verse 375: The Beginning

This is the beginning here
For the wise monk:
Sense-guarding, contentment,
And restraint in the monastic rules.[15]

#### Footnotes

[15] **Tatrāyam-ādi Bhavati**: The *ādi* (beginning, first step) for *paññassa bhikkhuno* (the wise monk) comprises three elements: *indriyagutti* (sense-faculty guarding), *santuṭṭhī* (contentment), and *saṁvaro pātimokkhe* (restraint in the *Pātimokkha*—the monastic code of 227 rules for monks). This establishes the foundation upon which higher practice builds.

---

### Verse 376: Spiritual Friendship

Resort to spiritual friends,
Those of pure livelihood, those who are diligent.
Be of friendly disposition,
Skillful in conduct.
Then, rejoicing greatly,
You will make an end to suffering.[16]

#### Footnotes

[16] **Mitte Bhajassu Kalyāṇe**: *Kalyāṇamittā* (spiritual friends, noble friends) should be *bhajassu* (associated with, cultivated). Qualities: *suddhājīve* (pure livelihood), *atandite* (diligent). One should be *paṭisanthāravuttassa* (of friendly disposition, hospitable) and *ācārakusala* (skilled in conduct). Result: *pāmojjabahulo* (having much rejoicing), one *dukkhassantaṁ karissati* (will make an end of suffering). Spiritual friendship is not optional but essential to the path.

---

### Verse 377: Casting Off

Just as the jasmine casts off
Its withered flowers,
So, O monks, should you cast off
Passion and hatred.[17]

#### Footnotes

[17] **Vassikā viya Pupphāni**: The *vassikā* (jasmine plant) *pamuñcati* (casts off, releases) its *maddavāni pupphāni* (withered, faded flowers). Monks should similarly *vippamuñcetha* (let go, cast off) *rāgañ-ca dosañ-ca* (passion and hatred). The metaphor suggests naturalness: just as the plant doesn't cling to dead flowers, practitioners shouldn't cling to emotional states that have served their time.

---

### Verse 378: The Peaceful One

Calm in body and calm in speech,
Having calmness and composure,
Having thrown off worldly gain—
That monk is called "one at peace."[18]

#### Footnotes

[18] **Santakāyo Santavāco**: *Santa* (calm, peaceful) describes *kāya* (body), *vācā* (speech), and the person generally (*santavā*). *Susamāhita* (well-composed, concentrated) adds mental stability. *Vantalokāmisa* (having vomited worldly baits—the enticements of gain, fame, praise, pleasure) describes renunciation. Such a *bhikkhu* is *upasanto ti vuccati* (called "one at peace").

---

### Verses 379-380: Self-Governance

**Verse 379**

By oneself one should censure oneself;
By oneself one should examine oneself.
Self-guarded and mindful,
The monk will dwell happily.[19]

**Verse 380**

Self is the protector of self;
Self is the refuge of self.
Therefore control yourself
As a merchant controls a noble horse.[20]

#### Footnotes

[19] **Attanā Codayattānaṁ**: *Codaya* (censure, urge, admonish) *attānaṁ* (oneself) *attanā* (by oneself). Similarly, *paṭimāsettaṁ* (examine, test) oneself by oneself. *Attagutta* (self-guarded), *satimā* (mindful)—such a *bhikkhu* will *sukhaṁ vihāhisi* (dwell happily). External authorities and critics are secondary; the monk must be their own teacher and examiner.

[20] **Attā hi Attano Nātho**: *Attā* (self) is *nātho* (protector, lord) of *attano* (oneself); *attā* is *gati* (refuge, destination) of self. Therefore *saṁyamaya attānaṁ* (restrain yourself) *assaṁ bhadraṁ va vāṇijo* (like a merchant [controls] a noble horse). The teaching emphasizes self-reliance while using the merchant-horse metaphor: value yourself enough to train yourself carefully.

### Verses 381-382: Joy and Radiance

**Verse 381**

The monk having much happiness,
With faith in the Buddha's teaching,
Could attain the state of peace—
The bliss of stilling all conditions.[21]

**Verse 382**

The young monk who devotes themselves
To the Buddha's teaching
Illuminates this world—
Like the moon freed from a cloud.[22]

#### Footnotes

[21] **Pāmojjabahulo Bhikkhu**: This verse repeats verse 368's conclusion but emphasizes *pāmojjabahula* (having abundant joy, gladness) as prerequisite. Faith (*pasanna*) in *Buddhasāsana* leads to *padaṁ santaṁ* (peaceful state), the *sukha* (bliss) of *saṅkhārūpasama* (calming formations).

[22] **Daharo Bhikkhu Yuñjati**: The *dahara* (young) *bhikkhu* who *yuñjati* (yokes themselves to, devotes themselves to) the Buddha's teaching *pabhāseti* (illuminates, makes shine) *imaṁ lokaṁ* (this world). The simile: *candimā abbhā mutto va* (like the moon freed from clouds). Young practitioners have special radiance when committed to the path—they shine through the darkness of the world.

4. **Attā hi Attano Nātho**: Self as one's own refuge and protector
5. **Udayabbaya (Rise and Fall)**: Insight into impermanence of aggregates

### Cross-References

- **Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta (MN 10)**: Elaborates the contemplation of aggregates (verse 374)
- **Kalyāṇamitta Sutta (SN 45.2)**: Buddha's statement that spiritual friendship is the "whole of the holy life"

### Historical Context

The *bhikkhu* was Buddhism's primary social institution: the dedicated renunciant who embodied the teaching and preserved its transmission. This chapter codifies monastic ideals while acknowledging practical challenges (contentment with little, avoiding envy). The balance between self-reliance (verses 379-380) and spiritual friendship (verse 376) reflects ongoing debates in Buddhist communities about the proper role of solitude versus sangha.
