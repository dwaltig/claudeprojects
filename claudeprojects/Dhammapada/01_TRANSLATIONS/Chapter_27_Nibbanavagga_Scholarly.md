# Chapter 27: Nibbanavagga (Nirvana)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Nibbanavagga

This reconstructed twenty-seventh chapter gathers the verses from the Brāhmaṇavagga that describe the state of liberation itself, rather than the ethical conduct of the liberated person. By grouping the opening verses (383-386) with the closing verses (411-423), we see a consistent focus on the "Unconditioned" (akata), the "Deathless" (amata), and the transcendence of duality (near and far shores).

### Verse 383: Cut the Stream

Strive and cut the stream, O brahmin!
Drive away sense-desires.
Knowing the destruction of conditions,
Be one who knows the unconditioned.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Chinda Sotaṁ**: The *sota* (stream) to be *chinda* (cut) is the current of craving that carries beings through saṃsāra. *Parakkamma* (striving, with effort) and *panuda kāme* (drive away sense-desires) are prerequisites. The goal: knowing (*ñatvā*) *saṅkhārānaṁ khayaṁ* (the destruction of conditioned phenomena), become *akataññū* (one who knows the *akata*—the unconditioned, the unmade, i.e., nibbāna). The verse opens the chapter by establishing that brahminhood means liberation, not lineage.

### Verse 384: Crossing Over Through Two Things

When a brahmin has crossed over
Through two things,
Then all fetters are laid to rest
For one who knows.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **Dvayesu Dhammesu Pāragū**: The "two things" (*dvaya dhamma*) traditionally refer to *samatha* (tranquility) and *vipassanā* (insight), or alternatively to knowledge and conduct. When one is *pāragū* (gone to the far shore) through these, *sabbe saṁyogā* (all fetters) reach *attha* (end, cessation) for *jānato* (one who knows).

### Verse 385: Beyond Both Shores

One for whom neither the near shore, the far shore,
Nor both shores exist—
Free of anxiety, detached—
That one I call a brahmin.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Pāraṁ Apāraṁ**: The *pāra* (far shore, liberation) and *apāra* (near shore, saṃsāra) represent the fundamental duality. For the truly liberated, even these distinctions dissolve: *pārāpāraṁ na vijjati* (neither exists as separate realities). *Vītaddara* (free of distress/anxiety), *visaṁyutta* (detached)—such a one transcends all categories.

---

### Verse 386: The Meditator Done

The meditator, seated, dustless,
Duty done, without pollutants,
Having reached the highest goal—
That one I call a brahmin.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **Jhāyiṁ Virajam-āsīnaṁ**: The accomplished practitioner *jhāyī* (meditates), is *viraja* (dustless—free from passion), *āsīna* (seated, established), *katakicca* (duty-done), *anāsava* (without pollutants/fermentations). Having *anuppatta* (reached) *uttamattha* (the highest purpose/goal)—nibbāna—that one is truly brahmin.

---

### Verse 411: No Desires, Immersed in Deathless

One who has no desires,
Who through knowledge is without doubt,
Who has reached immersion in the deathless—
That one I call a brahmin.[29]

#### Footnotes

[29] **Amatogadhaṁ Anuppattaṁ**: *Ālaya* (desires, attachments) *na vijjanti* (do not exist); *akathaṅkathī* (without doubt) through *aññā* (direct knowledge). *Amatogadha* (plunged into/immersed in the deathless) indicates complete union with nibbāna.

---

### Verse 412: Beyond Both Merit and Demerit

Whoever here has overcome attachment
To both merit and demerit,
Griefless, dustless, pure—
That one I call a brahmin.[30]

#### Footnotes

[30] **Puññañ-ca Pāpañ-ca Ubho Saṅgaṁ Upaccagā**: Even *puñña* (merit) and *pāpa* (demerit) represent *saṅga* (attachment) when clung to. The arahant *upaccagā* (surpasses, transcends) both. *Asoka* (griefless), *viraja* (dustless), *suddha* (pure)—beyond all karmic calculation.

---

### Verse 413: Like the Stainless Moon

Just like the moon—stainless, pure,
Clear and undisturbed—
Having destroyed delight in existence—
That one I call a brahmin.[31]

#### Footnotes

[31] **Candaṁ va Vimalaṁ Suddhaṁ**: The *canda* (moon) at fullness: *vimala* (stainless), *suddha* (pure), *vippasanna* (clear), *anāvila* (undisturbed, not muddy). One who has *nandībhavaparikkhīṇa* (destroyed delight-in-becoming)—freed from the joy that perpetuates rebirth.

---

### Verse 414: Crossed Over

One who has crossed this difficult path,
This mire, this saṃsāra, this delusion,
Who has crossed over to the far shore,
A meditator, without lust, without doubt,
Without grasping, extinguished—
That one I call a brahmin.[32]

#### Footnotes

[32] **Palipathaṁ Duggaṁ Saṁsāraṁ Moham-accagā**: *Palipatha* (miry path), *dugga* (difficult ground), *saṁsāra*, *moha* (delusion)—all *accagā* (surpassed, crossed). *Tiṇṇa* (crossed over), *pāragata* (gone to far shore), *jhāyī* (meditator), *aneja* (without lust), *akathaṅkathī* (without doubt), *anupādāya nibbuta* (without grasping, extinguished).

---

### Verses 415-416: Giving Up

**Verse 415**

Whoever, giving up sensual desires,
Would wander here homeless,
Having destroyed sense-desire and existence—
That one I call a brahmin.[33]

**Verse 416**

Whoever, giving up craving,
Would wander here homeless,
Having destroyed craving and existence—
That one I call a brahmin.[34]

#### Footnotes

[33] **Kāme Pahatvāna Anāgāro Paribbaje**: Abandoning *kāma* (sensual desires) to *paribbajati* (wander) *anāgāra* (homeless). *Kāmabhavaparikkhīṇa* (destroyed sense-desire and existence).

[34] **Taṇhaṁ Pahatvāna**: The same pattern with *taṇhā* (craving): abandoned for homeless wandering. *Taṇhābhavaparikkhīṇa* (destroyed craving and existence). These paired verses emphasize that both *kāma* and *taṇhā*—closely related but distinct terms—must be relinquished.

---

### Verse 417: Beyond Both Yokes

Abandoning the human yoke,
Overcoming the divine yoke,
Detached from all yokes—
That one I call a brahmin.[35]

#### Footnotes

[35] **Mānusakaṁ Yogaṁ Dibbaṁ Yogaṁ**: *Yoga* (yoke, bond) includes *mānusaka* (human—sense-pleasures, wealth) and *dibba* (divine—heavenly attainments, jhāna-pleasures). One *sabbayogavisaṁyutta* (detached from all yokes) transcends even celestial bondage.

---

### Verse 418: Hero Who Vanquished the World

Abandoning delight and aversion,
Cooled and free from substrata,
A hero who vanquished the whole world—
That one I call a brahmin.[36]

#### Footnotes

[36] **Hitvā Ratiñ-ca Aratiñ-ca**: Abandoning *rati* (delight) and *arati* (aversion)—the push-pull of attraction and rejection. *Sītibhūta* (cooled, not burning), *nirūpadhi* (without substrata, without basis for rebirth). *Sabbalokābhibhū* (conqueror of the whole world), *vīra* (hero).

### Verse 419: Knowing Death and Rebirth

Whoever knows beings' death
And their rebirth in every way,
Unattached, well-gone, awakened—
That one I call a brahmin.[37]

#### Footnotes

[37] **Cutiṁ Yo Vedi Sattānaṁ Upapattiñ-ca Sabbaso**: Knowledge of *cuti* (death, passing away) and *upapatti* (rebirth, arising in new existence) *sabbaso* (in every way, completely)—this describes *cutūpapāta-ñāṇa*, one of the Buddha's supernormal knowledges. *Asatta* (unattached), *sugata* (well-gone—the Buddha's epithet), *buddha* (awakened).

---

### Verse 420: Unknown Destiny

One whose destiny is unknown
To gods, gandhabbas, and humans—
Pollutant-free, an arahant—
That one I call a brahmin.[38]

#### Footnotes

[38] **Yassa Gatiṁ na Jānanti Devā Gandhabbamānusā**: The *gati* (destination, destiny) of such a one *na jānanti* (is not known) even to *devā* (gods), *gandhabba* (celestial musicians), and *mānusā* (humans). As *khīṇāsava* (pollutant-destroyed) and *arahanta* (worthy one, arahant), their liberation is beyond cosmic tracking.

---

### Verse 421: Nothing in Time

One for whom there is nothing
In past, future, or present,
Having nothing, unattached—
That one I call a brahmin.[39]

#### Footnotes

### Verse 422: Noble Leader

A great seer, victorious,
Without lust, bathed, awakened—

These epithets apply to the Buddha himself.

---

### Verse 423: The Accomplished One (Final Verse)

Whoever knows their former lives,
Who sees heaven and the states of woe,
Who has reached the destruction of birth,
The sage, accomplished in higher knowledge,
Accomplished in all accomplishments—
That one I call a brahmin.[41]

#### Footnotes

[41] **Pubbenivāsaṁ Yo Vedī Saggāpāyañ-ca Passati**: The culminating verse describes supreme attainment: *pubbenivāsa* (former lives) *vedī* (knowledge of); *saggāpāya* (heaven and states of woe) *passati* (sees); *jātikkhayaṁ patta* (reached birth's destruction); *abhiññāvosita muni* (sage accomplished in higher knowledge). *Sabbavositavosāna* (accomplished in all accomplishments)—the complete arahant. This is the Dhammapada's final definition of brahminhood: total realization.
