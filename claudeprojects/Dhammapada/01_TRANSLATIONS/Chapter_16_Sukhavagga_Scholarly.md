### Verses 197-200: Let Us Live Happily

**Verses 197-199**

Let us live truly happily,  
Without hatred among the hateful.  
Among humans who have hatred,  
Let us live without hatred.

Let us live truly happily,  
Without sickness among the sick.  
Among humans who are sick,  
Let us live without sickness.

Let us live truly happily,  
Without longing among those who long.  
Among humans who crave,  
Let us live without longing.

**Verse 200**

We live truly happily,  
We who have no possessions.  
We will feed on joy  
Like the gods of Streaming Light.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **The Triple Declaration**: *Susukhaṁ vata jīvāma* (we live truly happily) repeats as refrain. Three contrasts: *averino* (without hatred) among *verinesu* (the hateful); *anāturā* (without sickness) among *āturesu* (the sick); *anussukā* (without longing) among *ussukesu* (the longing). *Ābhassarā* (gods of Streaming Light) feed on *pīti* (joy) alone—the practitioner's model.

### Verses 201-204: Peace Is Supreme

**Verse 201**

The victor generates hatred;  
The defeated one finds suffering.  
The one at peace lives happily,  
Having abandoned victory and defeat.

**Verse 202**

There is no fire like passion,  
No offense like hatred,  
No suffering like the aggregates,  
No happiness beyond peace.

**Verse 203**

Hunger is the supreme sickness;  
Conditioned existence is the supreme suffering.  
Knowing this as it really is,  
Nibbāna is the supreme good.

**Verse 204**

Health is the supreme gain;  
Contentment is the supreme wealth;  
Confidence is the supreme kinship;  
Nibbāna is the supreme good.[2]

### Verses 205-208: The Taste of Dhamma

**Verse 205**

Savoring the taste of solitude,  
And the taste of peace—  
One becomes fearless, faultless,  
Drinking the joyful taste of Dhamma.

**Verses 206-207**

Meeting the noble is good;  
Living with them is always pleasant.  
Through not meeting fools  
One will constantly be happy.

He who consorts with fools  
Grieves for a long time.  
Dwelling with fools is suffering  
As with enemies always.  
The wise one dwells happily  
As with an assembly of kin.

**Verse 208**

Therefore, the firm, the wise, the learned,  
The virtuous, dutiful, noble—  
Accompany such a true, intelligent person  
As the moon accompanies the stars.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Companionship**: *Pavivekarasa* (taste of solitude) and *upasamassa rasa* (taste of peace) feed the practitioner. The extended teaching on companions: meet the noble, avoid fools. *Nakkhattapathaṁ va candimā* (as moon accompanies stars)—follow the noble like the moon follows its celestial path.
