# Chapter 4: Pupphavagga - Blues Edition
## Flowers: What Blooms and What Fades

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

The Buddha loved flowers. Used 'em to teach about everything—life, death, virtue, awakening. This chapter's all about what blooms and what fades. About gathering nectar without hurting what you take from. About virtue that rises like perfume against the wind. And about the lotus—that beautiful thing that grows right out of the mud.

### Verses 44-45: Who Knows the Dhamma Like a Flower?

**The Blues Truth:**

Who will know this earth?  
Who will know this earth?  
Who will know the realms below and the heavens above?

Who reflects on Dhamma,  
Who reflects on Dhamma,  
Like someone skilled reflecting on a flower's face?

The trainee knows this earth.  
The trainee knows this earth.  
The trainee knows the realms below and the heavens above.

The trainee reflects on Dhamma,  
The trainee reflects on Dhamma,  
Like someone skilled reflecting on a flower's face.

**Blues Notes:** The question-and-answer format (*ko...sekho*) creates call-and-response. The *sekha* (trainee) is on the path but not yet arrived—still learning to see the teachings like a florist sees blooms, with trained discernment.

### Verse 46: Body Like Foam

**The Blues Truth:**

This body, this body—  
It's foam on the water.  
This body, this body—  
It's a mirage in the heat.

See it for what it is,  
See it for what it is,  
Cut off Māra's pretty arrows tipped with flowers.

Go beyond where Death can see,  
Go beyond where Death can find,  
Go beyond, go beyond—  
Leave the King of Death behind.

**Blues Notes:** Three images of insubstantiality: *pheṇūpama* (like froth), *marīcidhamma* (mirage-nature), and *papupphakāni* (flower-adorned arrows—seductive but deadly). Seeing through all three deceptions leads beyond Death's sight.

### Verses 47-48: Gathering Flowers When Death Comes

**The Blues Truth:**

Gathering flowers, gathering flowers,  
Mind attached to what you're picking—  
Death comes, Death comes,  
Like a flood sweeping a sleeping village.

Gathering flowers, gathering flowers,  
Never satisfied with pleasures—  
Death comes, Death comes,  
Takes you before you're ever full.

Never satisfied, never satisfied,  
Still wanting more when Death arrives.  
Never satisfied, never satisfied,  
That's how the distracted dies.

**Blues Notes:** *Pupphāni pacinanta* (gathering flowers) = chasing pleasures. The repetition mirrors Pali's exact reuse of lines across both verses. *Atittaṁ yeva kāmesu* (unsated in sense-pleasures)—Death comes before desire is ever satisfied. That's the tragedy.

### Verse 49: Be Like the Bee

**The Blues Truth:**

The bee takes nectar, takes nectar,  
But doesn't hurt the flower.  
The bee takes nectar, takes nectar,  
Doesn't damage color or scent.

Be like the bee, be like the bee,  
Roam through the village light.  
Take what you need, take what you need,  
But leave the source all right.

**Blues Notes:** *Aheṭhayaṁ* (without harming)—the sage on alms-round receives without depleting. This is sustainable spiritual practice: taking sustenance without destroying what gives it.

---

### Verse 50: Mind Your Own Business

**The Blues Truth:**

Not what others did wrong,  
Not what others did wrong.  
Not what they did or didn't do—  
That's none of your concern.

Look at what YOU did wrong,  
Look at what YOU did wrong.  
What you did and didn't do—  
THAT'S your business to learn.

**Blues Notes:** *Na paresaṁ vilomāni* (not others' wrongs). The untrained mind loves judging others. But *attano va avekkheyya*—look at your own deeds. Judgment wastes energy; self-examination builds freedom.

### Verses 51-52: Flowers With and Without Scent

**The Blues Truth:**

A beautiful flower with no scent,  
A beautiful flower with no scent—  
That's like pretty words from someone  
Who don't do what they meant.

Talk is pretty but empty,  
Talk is pretty but empty,  
When you don't walk what you say.

A beautiful flower WITH fragrance,  
A beautiful flower WITH fragrance—  
That's like truth from someone  
Who lives it every day.

Talk bears fruit when you do it,  
Talk bears fruit when you do it,  
When you walk what you say.

**Blues Notes:** Classic twin-verse structure: *agandhakaṁ* (without fragrance) vs. *sagandhakaṁ* (with fragrance). The parallel emphasizes: words without action = scentless flower. Words with action = the real bloom.

### Verse 53: Make Garlands from Your Life

**The Blues Truth:**

From a heap of flowers,  
From a heap of flowers,  
Make many, many garlands.

From your mortal life,  
From your mortal life,  
Do many, many goods.

You're born, you'll die—  
You're born, you'll die—  
So weave something beautiful while you can.

**Blues Notes:** *Jātena maccena* (one born mortal) emphasizes our limited time. The heap of flowers is our opportunities; the garlands are our good deeds. Weave while you can—the flowers will wilt.

### Verses 54-56: Virtue's Fragrance Rises

**The Blues Truth:**

Flower perfume follows the wind,  
Flower perfume follows the wind—  
Sandalwood, jasmine, all go where the breeze blows.

But virtue's fragrance?  
Virtue's fragrance?  
Goes AGAINST the wind, spreads everywhere.

Sandalwood, jasmine, water lily—  
All those pretty scents—  
Nothing compared to virtue,  
Nothing compared to living right.

Virtue rises, virtue rises,  
All the way to the gods.  
Virtue rises, virtue rises,  
Supreme beyond all odds.

**Blues Notes:** *Sīlagandha* (virtue's fragrance) defies physics—spreads *paṭivātam* (against the wind), reaches *devesu* (among the gods). Three verses build: virtue surpasses all natural fragrances, rises to heaven, is *anuttara* (unsurpassed).

---

### Verse 57: Māra Can't Find You

**The Blues Truth:**

Virtuous, virtuous—  
Living heedfully.  
Freed by knowing, freed by knowing—  
Māra can't find the way.

Can't find your path,  
Can't track you down,  
Can't follow where you've gone.  
You've disappeared from evil's sight—  
You've moved beyond, moved on.

**Blues Notes:** *Māro maggaṁ na vindati* (Māra cannot find the path). Three qualities make you invisible to evil: *sampannasīla* (endowed with virtue), *appamādavihāri* (living heedfully), *sammad-aññāvimutta* (freed through right knowledge).

### Verses 58-59: The Lotus in the Garbage

**The Blues Truth:**

On a garbage heap, garbage heap,  
Thrown by the highway side—  
A lotus grows, a lotus grows,  
Pure and beautiful inside.

Sweet-scented, mind-delighting,  
Rising from the muck and grime.  
That's the lotus, that's the lotus,  
Blooming in the worst of times.

Among the blind folks, ordinary folks,  
Living in delusion's dark—  
The Buddha's student shines, just shines,  
Wisdom lighting up the heart.

Outshines with wisdom, outshines with wisdom,  
Like the lotus from the mud.  
Outshines with wisdom, outshines with wisdom—  
That's the meaning of the bud.

**Blues Notes:** *Saṅkāradhāna* (garbage heap) becomes the ground for *paduma* (lotus). This is Buddhism's beloved image: awakening emerges FROM samsara, not despite it. The muck is necessary—no mud, no lotus. *Atirocati paññāya* (outshines through wisdom)—the disciple rises brilliant from ordinary darkness.

**Blues Notes on Translation Method:**

Flower imagery runs deep in the Blues—roses, lilies, blossoms that fade. The Buddha's teaching and the Blues agree: beauty is temporary, but what you DO with your life—the garlands you weave, the fragrance you leave behind—that's what matters. And the lotus? That's hope. That's the promise that something pure can rise from the dirtiest conditions. Every Blues singer knows that truth.
