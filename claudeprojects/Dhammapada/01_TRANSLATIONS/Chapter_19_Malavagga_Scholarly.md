# Chapter 18: Malavagga (Impurity / Stains)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Malavagga

The eighteenth chapter addresses *mala* (stains, impurities, rust). The central teaching: stains arise from within (like rust from iron) and consume what they arise from. Ignorance is the supreme stain. The silversmith metaphor shows gradual purification.

### Verses 235-239: Withered Leaf, Make Your Island

**Verses 235-238**

You are now like a withered leaf;  
Yama's messengers stand waiting.  
You stand at decay's door—  
With no provisions for the journey.

Make an island for yourself!  
Quickly strive, become wise.  
Removing the stain, blemishless,  
You will reach the divine, noble realm.

You are now advanced in age;  
You have come to Yama's presence.  
There is nowhere to dwell between—  
With no provisions for the journey.

Make an island for yourself!  
Quickly strive, become wise.  
Removing the stain, blemishless,  
You will not come to birth and old age again.

**Verse 239**

The sage gradually, little by little, moment by moment,  
Should remove the stain from himself—  
Like a silversmith removes impurity from silver.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **The Island and the Silversmith**: *Dīpam-attano* (island for oneself)—the self as refuge. *Yamapurisā* (Yama's messengers)—death's servants. The silversmith metaphor (*kammāro rajatasseva*) shows patient, gradual purification.

### Verses 240-243: Stains Consume Their Source

**Verses 240-243**

As rust arises from iron  
And eats away what it arose from,  
So one's own deeds lead the overindulgent  
To a bad destination.

Lack of repetition is the stain of mantras;  
Lack of maintenance is the stain of homes;  
Laziness is the stain of beauty;  
Heedlessness is the stain of one on guard.

Bad conduct is a stain for women;  
Stinginess is a giver's stain.  
Wicked deeds are stains  
In this world and the next.

Worse than those stains:  
Ignorance is the supreme stain.  
Abandoning that stain,  
Be stainless, O monastics![2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **Ignorance as Supreme Stain**: *Avijjā paramaṁ malaṁ* (ignorance is supreme stain). Various stains are listed, but ignorance underlies all. The rust metaphor: stains arise from within and destroy their source.

### Verses 244-248: Easy Life vs. Hard Life

**Verses 244-245**

Life is easy for the shameless,  
Bold as a crow, backbiting,  
Reckless, living with defilements.

Life is hard for one with shame,  
Constantly seeking purity,  
Sincere, not reckless, seeing the pure life.

**Verses 246-248**

Whoever kills, speaks falsely,  
Takes what is not given,  
Goes to another's spouse,  
Devotes himself to liquor—  
Digs up his own root in this world.

Know this, dear friend:  
Lack of restraint is a bad thing.  
Let not greed and corruption  
Oppress you with suffering long.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **The Five Precepts**: Verses 246-247 list violations of the five precepts: killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, intoxication. *Mūlaṁ khaṇati attano* (digs up one's own root)—self-destruction.

### Verses 249-255: Passion, Hate, Delusion, Craving

**Verses 251-253**

No fire like passion;  
No seizing like hatred;  
No snare like delusion;  
No flood like craving.

Easy to see are others' faults;  
One's own is hard to see.  
One sifts others' faults like chaff  
But hides one's own like a crafty cheat.

Who constantly looks for others' faults,  
An abject complainer—  
For that one, pollutants increase;  
He is far from their destruction.

**Verses 254-255**

No footprint in the sky;  
No ascetic on the outside.  
Folk delight in impediments;  
The Tathāgatas are free of them.

No footprint in the sky;  
No ascetic on the outside.  
No conditions are eternal;  
No disturbance for the Buddhas.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **Four Dangers**: *Rāga* (passion) as fire, *dosa* (hatred) as seizure, *moha* (delusion) as snare, *taṇhā* (craving) as flood—classic formulation. Fault-finding increases pollutants. Final verses: liberation leaves no trace, like sky.
