# Chapter 19: Dhammaṭṭhavagga (The Just / One Who Stands by Dhamma)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Dhammaṭṭhavagga

The nineteenth chapter addresses *dhammaṭṭha* (one who stands by Dhamma)—defining true wisdom, true eldership, true monasticism. The teaching repeatedly uses the pattern "not by X is one Y"—challenging external markers like speaking much, grey hair, or shaved head.

### Verses 256-259: Not by Speaking Much

**Verses 256-257**

One who hastily settles cases  
Is not one who stands by Dhamma.  
The wise one discriminates both:  
What is the case and what is not.

One who settles without haste,  
Justly, impartially—  
The sagacious one, protecting Dhamma,  
Is called one who stands by Dhamma.

**Verses 258-259**

One is not wise merely from speaking much;  
Being safe, hatred-free, fearless—  
That one is called a wise person.

One is not a Dhamma-bearer from speaking much,  
But one who, having heard even a little,  
Sees Dhamma for oneself—  
That is a Dhamma-bearer,  
Not heedless regarding Dhamma.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Experience Over Talk**: *Bahu bhāsati* (speaking much) doesn't make one wise or a Dhamma-bearer. *Dhammaṁ kāyena passati* (sees Dhamma in/with the body)—direct experience, not verbal knowledge.

### Verses 260-265: Not by External Marks

**Verses 260-261**

One is not an elder because the head has grey hair;  
Merely well-matured in age, one is "old in vain."  
In whom is truth, Dhamma, non-violence,  
Restraint and training—  
The wise one who threw out the stain  
Is truly called an elder.

**Verses 262-265**

Not by eloquence alone or beautiful complexion  
Is one honorable, if still jealous, selfish, deceitful.  
For one in whom this is cut off, destroyed at root—  
That sage who threw out hatred is called honorable.

Not by a shaven head is one an ascetic,  
If lacking vows, speaking lies, full of greed.  
One who pacifies wicked deeds, small and great—  
Through pacifying evil is called an ascetic.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **True Titles**: *Thera* (elder) is not about grey hair (*palitaṁ siro*) but about truth, non-violence, restraint. *Sādhurūpa* (honorable) requires cutting out jealousy, selfishness, deceit. *Samaṇa* (ascetic) means pacifying (*sameti*) evil, not external renunciation.

### Verses 266-272: True Monastics and Seers

**Verses 266-269**

One is not a monastic merely from eating almsfood  
Or undertaking false Dhamma.  
One who wards off both merit and demerit,  
Walking with discrimination—that one is a monastic.

Not through silence is a fool considered a seer.  
The wise one, like holding a balance,  
Takes up what is noble.  
The seer who rejects wicked deeds is a seer;  
Who understands both worlds is called a seer.

**Verses 270-272**

Not by hurting living beings is one noble;  
Not hurting any being, one is called noble.

Not merely through virtue, vows, learning,  
Concentration, or secluded dwelling—  
Do I attain renunciation's happiness.  
Let the monastic not be confident  
Until the pollutants are destroyed.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **No Complacency**: The chapter ends with warning: *vissāsa māpādi* (don't be confident) until *āsavakkhaya* (pollutants destroyed). External accomplishments don't guarantee liberation.
