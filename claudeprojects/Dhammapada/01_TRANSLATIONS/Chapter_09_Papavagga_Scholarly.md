# Chapter 9: Pāpavagga (Evil)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Pāpavagga

The ninth chapter addresses *pāpa* (evil, wickedness)—not as demonic force but as harmful action that accumulates consequences. Key teachings: hasten to good, avoid repetition of evil, karma ripens gradually like water drops filling a pot, and nowhere on earth can one hide from consequences.

### Verses 116-118: Speed Toward Good, Away from Evil

**Verse 116**

Hasten to do wholesome deeds;  
Ward the mind from wickedness.  
For the mind slow in meriting  
Delights in wickedness.[1]

**Verse 117**

Should someone do an evil deed,  
They should not do it again and again.  
Let them not set their intention there—  
Suffering accumulates for the wicked.

**Verse 118**

Should someone do a good deed,  
They should do it again and again.  
Let them set their intention there—  
Joy accumulates for one who makes merit.[2]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Urgency for Good**: *Abhittharetha* (hasten, be quick) conveys urgency—good deeds need not wait. *Dandhaṁ karato* (one slow in making merit)—delay is dangerous because the untrained mind naturally inclines toward wickedness.

[2] **Accumulation Principle**: Twin verses contrast *pāpa* (wickedness) and *puñña* (merit). *Punappunaṁ* (again and again)—repetition builds momentum. *Chanda* (intention)—where we place intention matters. *Uccaya* (accumulation)—karma builds up, for suffering or joy.

### Verses 119-120: Delayed Ripening

**Verse 119**

Even the wicked one experiences good fortune  
While the wickedness does not ripen;  
But when the wickedness ripens,  
The wicked one experiences wicked results.

**Verse 120**

Even the fortunate one experiences misfortune  
While the good fortune does not ripen;  
But when the good fortune ripens,  
The fortunate one experiences good results.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Karmic Delay**: *Paccati* (ripens, cooks)—karma matures like fruit. Current experience doesn't always match current actions because of time lag. The wicked may prosper temporarily; the good may suffer temporarily. But eventual ripening is certain.

### Verses 121-122: Water Drops Fill the Pot

**Verse 121**

Do not dismiss wickedness thinking,  
"It will not come to me."  
Through the falling of water drops  
The water pot is filled.  
The fool, gathering bit by bit,  
Becomes full of wickedness.

**Verse 122**

Do not dismiss merit thinking,  
"It will not come to me."  
Through the falling of water drops  
The water pot is filled.  
The wise one, gathering bit by bit,  
Becomes full of merit.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **The Water Drop Simile**: *Udabindunipātena udakumbho pūrati* (through falling drops the pot fills). Each drop seems insignificant; together they fill the vessel. *Thokaṁ thokam-pi ācinaṁ* (gathering bit by bit)—both evil and good accumulate through small repetitions. Never dismiss an action as too small to matter.

### Verses 123-124: Avoiding Poison

**Verse 123**

Like a merchant on a dangerous road,  
With few companions and great wealth,  
Like one loving life avoiding poison—  
So should one avoid wicked deeds.

**Verse 124**

If there is no wound in the hand,  
One can carry poison in the palm.  
Poison does not enter without a wound;  
No evil results for one who does no wrong.[5]

#### Footnotes

[5] **The Poison Simile**: *Visaṁ jīvitukāmo va* (like one loving life [avoiding] poison)—the instinct for self-preservation applied to karma. The wound metaphor is subtle: *nābbaṇaṁ visam-anveti* (poison doesn't enter without wound). If there's no opening for evil (no evil deed), no bad result can "enter."

### Verse 125: Dust Against the Wind

**Verse 125**

One who offends against an inoffensive person,  
A purified, passionless one—  
That wicked deed returns to the fool  
Like fine dust thrown against the wind.[6]

#### Footnotes

[6] **Karmic Boomerang**: *Sukhumo rajo paṭivātaṁ va khitto* (like fine dust thrown against the wind). Attacking the pure backfires completely—the harm returns to the attacker. *Appaduṭṭha* (inoffensive), *suddha* (purified), *anaṅgaṇa* (passionless) describe one who cannot be karmically harmed.

### Verse 126: Four Destinies

**Verse 126**

Some are reborn in the womb;  
Evildoers go to the underworld;  
The righteous go to heaven;  
Those without pollutants attain complete liberation.[7]

#### Footnotes

[7] **Rebirth Destinations**: Four possibilities: (1) *gabbha* (womb)—human realm; (2) *niraya* (underworld/hell)—for evildoers; (3) *sagga* (heaven)—for the righteous; (4) *parinibbāna* (complete liberation)—for those *anāsavā* (pollutant-free). This verse maps karma to rebirth.

### Verses 127-128: Nowhere to Hide

**Verse 127**

Neither in the sky, nor in mid-ocean,  
Nor entering a mountain cave—  
There is no place on earth  
Where one can escape wicked deeds.

**Verse 128**

Neither in the sky, nor in mid-ocean,  
Nor entering a mountain cave—  
There is no place on earth  
Where death will not overcome one.[8]

#### Footnotes

[8] **Inescapable Consequences**: The parallel structure emphasizes: *na vijjatī so jagatippadeso* (no place on earth exists) where one can hide from karma or from death. *Antalikkhe* (sky), *samuddamajjhe* (mid-ocean), *pabbatānaṁ vivaraṁ* (mountain cleft)—nowhere is safe. The universe has no hiding places.
