# Chapter 15: Tathagatavagga - Blues Edition
## The Tathagata: The Secure Refuge

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

This new chapter—the *Tathagatavagga*—focuses on the Core Doctrines. While the previous chapter praised the *person* of the Buddha, this one gives us the *substance* of his liberation: The Three Refuges and the Four Noble Truths. This is the roadmap.

### Verses 188-192: The Three Refuges

**The Blues Truth:**

Shaken by fear, shaken by fear,  
People run to the mountains.  
Run to the forest, run to tree shrines—  
Looking for safety in fountains.

BUT—

That's not a safe refuge, safe refuge.  
That's not the refuge supreme.  
Coming to THAT won't free you—  
Won't end the suffering stream.

Whoever takes refuge in BUDDHA,  
Whoever takes refuge in DHAMMA,  
Whoever takes refuge in SANGHA,  
And sees the Four Noble Truths:

Suffering.  
The arising of suffering.  
The overcoming of suffering.  
The Eightfold Path that stills.

THAT is a safe refuge, safe refuge.  
THAT is the refuge supreme.  
Coming to THAT liberates—  
Frees you from every suffering stream.

Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha.  
Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha.  
THAT'S where freedom lives.

**Blues Notes:** Mountains and forests don't liberate; Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha do. But refuge includes *seeing with right wisdom* the Four Noble Truths—not just faith, but understanding.

### Verses 193-196: The Buddha's Arising Is Good

**The Blues Truth:**

A noble person is rare, rare,  
Not born everywhere.  
Wherever they're born, that family  
Gets happiness to share.

Good is the arising of Buddhas.  
Good is the teaching of truth.  
Good is the harmony of Sangha.  
Good is the devotion of youth.

Those who worship the awakened,  
Those who honor the free—  
Their merit is beyond measure,  
Beyond what eyes can see.
