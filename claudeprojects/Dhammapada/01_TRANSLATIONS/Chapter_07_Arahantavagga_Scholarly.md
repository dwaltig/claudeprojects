# Chapter 7: Arahantavagga (The Arahants)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Arahantavagga

The seventh chapter portrays the *arahant*—the "worthy one" who has completed the path, destroyed all defilements, and will not be reborn. These ten verses paint the arahat state through striking images: geese leaving a lake, birds leaving no track in sky, earth unmoved, city-post unshakeable. This is the goal toward which all earlier chapters point.

### Verse 90: No Consuming Fever

**Verse 90**

For one who has reached the goal,  
Who grieves not, released on all sides,  
Who has abandoned all the knots—  
No consuming fever is found.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **The Completed Journey**: *Gataddhino* (one who has reached the goal/end of the road) marks arrival. *Visoka* (griefless) and *vippamutta sabbadhi* (released on all sides) describe complete freedom. *Sabbaganthappahīna* (abandoned all knots)—the four *gantha* (knots: covetousness, ill-will, attachment to rites, dogmatism) are cut. *Pariḷāho* (consuming fever, burning)—the mental torment of craving—no longer exists.

### Verse 91: Geese Leaving the Lake

**Verse 91**

The mindful ones striving diligently  
Do not delight in dwelling places.  
Like geese who abandon a lake,  
They leave behind all fondness for homes.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **The Goose Migration**: *Haṁsā va pallalaṁ hitvā* (like geese who abandon a lake)—wild geese migrate without attachment to their temporary waters. *Okam-okaṁ jahanti* (they leave home after home)—the arahat moves on, never clinging to any dwelling. The image combines freedom with purposeful movement.

### Verses 92-93: Birds in the Sky

**Verse 92**

Those who have no stores,  
Who comprehend food aright,  
Whose resort is the liberation  
That is empty and signless—  
Like birds in the sky,  
Their track is hard to find.

**Verse 93**

For the one whose pollutants are destroyed,  
Who is not dependent on food,  
Whose resort is the liberation  
That is empty and signless—  
Like birds in the sky,  
His footprint is hard to find.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Trackless Flight**: *Ākāse va sakuntānaṁ gati durannayā* (like birds in the sky, their track is hard to find). Birds leave no permanent trace in the air; similarly, arahants leave no trace for Māra or rebirth to follow. *Suññato animitto vimokkho* (liberation that is empty and signless)—two of the three liberations (emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness) that characterize arahat consciousness. *Pariññātabhojanā* (comprehend food aright)—eating mindfully, without craving.

### Verse 94: Even Gods Envy

**Verse 94**

One whose senses are stilled,  
Like horses well-trained by a charioteer,  
Who has abandoned conceit,  
Who is without pollutants—  
Even the gods envy such a one.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **Divine Envy**: *Assā yathā sārathinā sudantā* (like horses well-trained by a charioteer)—sense faculties are the horses, mind is the charioteer. When properly trained, they obey perfectly. *Pahīnamāna* (abandoned conceit) and *anāsava* (without pollutants) describe complete purification. *Devā pi pihayanti* (even gods envy)—remarkable claim: celestial beings, for all their pleasure, cannot match the arahat's liberation. The gods are still bound; the arahat is free.

### Verse 95: Earth, Post, Lake

**Verse 95**

Untroubled like the earth,  
Steadfast like a city-post,  
Like a lake free from mud—  
Such a one continues not in births and deaths.[5]

#### Footnotes

[5] **Three Stability Images**: *Paṭhavisamo* (like the earth)—the earth accepts all, unmoved by what's poured on it. *Indakhīlūpama* (like a city-post/Indra's pillar)—the great post at a city gate, driven deep, immovable. *Rahado apetakaddamo* (lake free from mud)—clarity and purity. *Saṁsārā na bhavanti* (continues not in births and deaths)—the ultimate result: samsara ends.

### Verse 96: Triple Peace

**Verse 96**

His mind is calm,  
His speech is calm,  
His actions are calm—  
Liberated by right knowledge,  
Such a one is truly peaceful.[6]

#### Footnotes

[6] **Santa Triad**: *Santaṁ manaṁ, santā vācā, santaṁ kammaṁ* (calm mind, calm speech, calm action)—the three doors of activity are all pacified. *Sammad-aññāvimutta* (liberated by right knowledge)—not through ritual or luck but through direct insight. *Upasanta* (truly peaceful)—peace has perfused every aspect of being.

### Verse 97: The Supreme Person

**Verse 97**

The one beyond mere faith,  
Who knows the unmade,  
Who has cut off rebirth-linking,  
Who has destroyed the occasion,  
Who has thrown out hope and desire—  
This is truly the supreme person.[7]

#### Footnotes

[7] **Five Marks of Supremacy**: (1) *Assaddha* (beyond mere faith)—not faithless but beyond the need for faith, having direct knowledge; (2) *Akataññū* (knows the unmade)—knows nibbāna, the unconditioned; (3) *Sandhiccheda* (cut the link)—severed the connection to future rebirth; (4) *Hatāvakāso* (destroyed the occasion)—eliminated the conditions for further becoming; (5) *Vantāso* (thrown out hope/desire)—ejected all craving. *Uttamaporiso* (supreme person)—the arahat is humanity's highest possibility.

### Verse 98: Wherever They Live

**Verse 98**

Whether in village or wilderness,  
On low ground or high—  
Wherever the arahants dwell,  
That ground is delightful.[8]

#### Footnotes

[8] **Consecrated Ground**: *Gāme vā yadi vāraññe, ninne vā yadi vā thale* (village or wilderness, low or high)—the arahat's location doesn't matter. *Rāmaṇeyyakaṁ* (delightful, charming)—their presence transforms the place. This inverts our usual assumption that places make us happy; here, the person blesses the place.

### Verse 99: Delighting Where Others Cannot

**Verse 99**

The delightful wildernesses  
Where ordinary people find no delight—  
Those without passion will take joy there,  
For they seek not sense pleasures.[9]

#### Footnotes

[9] **Inverted Pleasures**: *Ramaṇīyāni araññāni* (delightful wildernesses)—the forest is objectively beautiful. *Yattha na ramatī jano* (where people find no delight)—ordinary people, craving stimulation, are bored. *Vītarāgā ramissanti* (those without passion delight)—the arahat, desiring nothing, can appreciate what is. *Na te kāmagavesino* (not seeking sense pleasures)—their joy doesn't depend on external gratification.
