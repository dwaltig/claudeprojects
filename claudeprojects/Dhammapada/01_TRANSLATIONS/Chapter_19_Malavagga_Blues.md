# Chapter 18: Malavagga - Blues Edition
## Impurity: Rust Eats the Iron It Comes From

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

Stains. Rust. Impurity. This chapter's central teaching: rust comes from iron and eats the iron it came from. Your own unwholesome deeds destroy YOU. But there's hope: the silversmith removes stains gradually, little by little. Make your island. Become wise. Ignorance is the supreme stain—abandon it.

### Verses 235-239: Withered Leaf, Make Your Island

**The Blues Truth:**

You're like a withered leaf now, withered leaf,  
Yama's messengers are at the door.  
Standing at decay's gate, decay's gate—  
With no provisions for what's in store.

MAKE YOUR ISLAND, make your island!  
Quickly strive, become wise.  
Remove the stain, become blemishless—  
Then to the divine realm you'll rise.

You're advanced in age now, advanced in age,  
Come to Yama's very presence.  
Nowhere to dwell in between—  
No provisions for the journey hence.

MAKE YOUR ISLAND, make your island!  
Quickly strive, become wise.  
Remove the stain, become blemishless—  
No more birth, no more age to arise.

The sage removes stains gradually,  
Little by little, moment by moment—  
Like a silversmith polishing silver,  
Pure from the patient atonement.

**Blues Notes:** *Dīpam-attano* (island for oneself). *Yamapurisā* (Yama's messengers). Silversmith metaphor: patient, gradual purification.

### Verses 240-243: Rust Eats the Iron

**The Blues Truth:**

Rust comes from iron, from iron,  
Then eats the iron it came from.  
Your own deeds work the same way—  
They'll take you where the bad ones come.

Stain of mantras: not repeating.  
Stain of houses: not maintaining.  
Stain of beauty: being lazy.  
Stain of the guard: not remaining.

Bad conduct stains. Stinginess stains.  
Wicked deeds are stains everywhere—  
This world and the next, the next.

BUT—

Worse than all those stains:  
IGNORANCE is the supreme stain.  
Abandon that one, abandon that one—  
Be stainless. That's the aim.

### Verses 244-248: Easy Life, Hard Life

**The Blues Truth:**

Life is EASY for the shameless, shameless,  
Bold as a crow, no care.  
Backbiting, reckless, defiled within—  
Life is light without awareness there.

But life is HARD for one with shame, with shame,  
Constantly seeking pure.  
Sincere, not reckless, looking for the clean—  
That path requires more.

Who kills, who lies, who steals, who cheats,  
Who goes to another's spouse,  
Who drinks and drinks without restraint—  
DIGS UP HIS OWN ROOT in this house.

Know this, friend: lack of restraint is bad.  
Don't let greed and corruption  
Oppress you with suffering long—  
That's the way of self-destruction.

### Verses 251-255: Four Dangers, No Footprint

**The Blues Truth:**

No fire like PASSION.  
No grip like HATRED.  
No snare like DELUSION.  
No flood like CRAVING.

Easy to see others' faults, others' faults.  
Your own? Hard to find.  
You sift their faults like chaff, like chaff,  
But hide your own behind like a crafty cheat.

Who looks for others' faults all day, all day,  
A constant complainer—  
The pollutants grow in that one;  
Liberation gets no nearer.

No footprint in the sky.  
No ascetic on the outside.  
Folk love their impediments;  
Buddhas are free inside.

No footprint in the sky.  
No conditions last forever.  
No disturbance for the Buddhas—  
They've cut the final tether.
