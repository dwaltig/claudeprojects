# Chapter 16: Piyavagga - Blues Edition
## What Is Dear: The Root of Grief and Fear

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

Love. The sweetest thing—and the sharpest knife. From love comes grief. From love comes fear. This chapter traces the root: love, fondness, delight, desire, craving—all lead to the same place. But the one who lets go? No grief. No fear. How could there be?

### Verses 209-211: Don't Cling

**The Blues Truth:**

Grasping what you love, grasping what you love,  
Leaving what's good behind—  
You'll end up envying those  
Who worked on their own mind.

Don't hold the loved ones too tight, too tight.  
Don't cling to enemies either.  
Not seeing the loved brings pain;  
Seeing the hated—same grievance fever.

So hold nothing as dear, as dear.  
Because losing what's loved is pain.  
No bonds exist for those  
Who've dropped the loved/unloved game.

**Blues Notes:** *Ganthā tesaṁ na vijjanti* (no knots for those) who transcend both loved and unloved. Attachment guarantees eventual suffering.

### Verses 212-216: Five Roots of Grief and Fear

**The Blues Truth:**

From LOVE comes grief, from LOVE comes fear.  
Free from love? No grief. How could there be fear?

From FONDNESS comes grief, from FONDNESS comes fear.  
Free from fondness? No grief. How could there be fear?

From DELIGHT comes grief, from DELIGHT comes fear.  
Free from delight? No grief. How could there be fear?

From DESIRE comes grief, from DESIRE comes fear.  
Free from desire? No grief. How could there be fear?

From CRAVING comes grief, from CRAVING comes fear.  
Free from craving? No grief. HOW COULD THERE BE FEAR?

Love, fondness, delight, desire, craving—  
Five names for the same root.  
Cut the root, cut the root,  
And grief and fear go moot.

**Blues Notes:** Five parallel verses, identical structure. *Piya, pema, rati, kāma, taṇhā*—love, fondness, delight, desire, craving. All produce *soka* (grief) and *bhaya* (fear). Freedom from any of them = freedom from both.

### Verses 217-220: True Love Is Different

**The Blues Truth:**

One with virtue and insight,  
Principled, knowing truth,  
Doing their proper work—  
THAT one the people love for proof.

One going upstream, upstream,  
Mind touched by awakening—  
Unattached to pleasure's stream,  
That's a different kind of thing.

When someone long gone comes home safe,  
Family rejoices at the door.  
Just so, when a merit-maker dies,  
Merit welcomes them—and more.

Like family at the gate, the gate,  
Merit receives your soul.  
The good you've done becomes your kin  
When you cross to the final goal.
