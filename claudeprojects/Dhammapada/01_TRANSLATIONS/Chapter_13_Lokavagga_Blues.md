# Chapter 13: Lokavagga - Blues Edition
## The World: Bubble, Mirage, Gilded Trap

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

The world. Beautiful like a king's chariot—and just as trapping. See it as a bubble. See it as a mirage. The fools get depressed when it fails them; the wise see through it and aren't bound. And here's the kicker: stream-entry—just the FIRST step on the path—is worth more than ruling the whole world.

### Verses 167-169: Live by Dhamma

**The Blues Truth:**

Don't follow lowly things, lowly things,  
Don't live heedlessly.  
Don't follow wrong views, wrong views—  
Don't foster worldly ways.

Strive, don't slack, don't slack,  
Live by Dhamma, live right.  
Those who live by Dhamma, Dhamma,  
Rest easy day and night.

This world and the next, next,  
Both at ease, both at peace.  
Live by Dhamma, live by Dhamma—  
That's where suffering cease.

### Verses 170-171: Bubble, Mirage, Gilded Chariot

**The Blues Truth:**

See it as a bubble, bubble,  
See it as a mirage.  
Look at the world that way, that way—  
Death's king can't find your passage.

Come, look at this world, this world,  
Gilded like a royal ride.  
Beautiful, shining, attractive—  
But fools get depressed inside.

No bond for those who understand, understand.  
No bond for those who see.  
See through the gilded chariot—  
And you are FREE.

**Blues Notes:** *Bubbuḷaka* (bubble), *marīcikā* (mirage), *rājarathūpama* (king's chariot)—all beautiful, all empty. *Natthi saṅgo vijānataṁ*—no bond for those who understand.

### Verses 172-173: Moon Breaking Through

**The Blues Truth:**

Was heedless before, heedless before,  
But now you've woken up—  
You shine on this world, shine on this world,  
Like the moon when clouds break up.

Did wicked deeds before, before,  
But now you cover them with good—  
You shine on this world, shine on this world,  
Like the moon released from its hood.

The cloud can't destroy the moon, the moon,  
It only hides it for a while.  
Your luminous nature remains, remains—  
It's waiting to shine and smile.

**Blues Notes:** *Abbhā mutto va candimā* (moon released from cloud). Past heedlessness or past evil can be overcome. The cloud obscures but doesn't destroy the moon.

### Verses 174-175: Few Escape

**The Blues Truth:**

This world is blind, blind, blind,  
Few here really see.  
Few go up to heaven—  
Like birds that break free from the net.

Geese fly the sun's path, sun's path,  
High through the sky they roam.  
The wise are led out of the world  
After beating Māra and his throne.

Few escape, few escape,  
Most stay bound in the net.  
But those who defeat the tempter—  
They reach where freedom's set.

**Blues Notes:** *Andhabhūto ayaṁ loko* (this world is blind). *Sakunto jālamutto va* (like birds escaping the net)—few achieve liberation.

### Verses 176-177: The Liar and the Miser

**The Blues Truth:**

Speak falsely, lie and lie—  
Once truth is gone, all wickedness follows.  
Abandon the next world for this one?  
The future turns hollow.

The miserly don't reach heaven, reach heaven.  
Fools don't praise giving.  
But the wise rejoice in generosity—  
THAT'S the art of living.

Give freely, give freely,  
And happiness follows behind.  
Give freely, give freely—  
That's peace of the generous kind.

### Verse 178: Better Than World Sovereignty

**The Blues Truth:**

Rule the whole earth, the WHOLE earth—  
Or go to heaven above—  
Or be lord of all the worlds, all worlds—  
BETTER is the first taste of freedom's love.

Stream-entry, stream-entry,  
Just the first step on the way—  
Worth more than ruling everything,  
Worth more than all the world's display.

One step on the path, the path,  
One glimpse of what's true—  
Worth more than being king of everything.  
That first step changes you.

**Blues Notes:** *Sotāpattiphalaṁ varaṁ* (stream-entry is better). Stream-entry is just the FIRST stage of enlightenment—and it's already worth more than maximum worldly success.

**What We Learned:**

1. Don't follow lowly things or wrong views
2. Live by Dhamma—rest easy in both worlds
3. See the world as bubble, as mirage
4. The gilded chariot binds fools; the wise see through
5. Past heedlessness can be overcome—moon breaks through clouds
6. Past evil covered by good—you can shine again
7. This world is blind; few escape the net
8. The wise defeat Māra and fly free
9. Lying opens the door to all wickedness
10. Miserliness blocks heaven; generosity opens it
11. STREAM-ENTRY IS BETTER THAN WORLD SOVEREIGNTY

See it as a bubble.  
See it as a mirage.  
See through the gilded world—  
And you won't be in its cage.

**Blues Notes on Translation Method:**

The Blues knows illusion. Every singer who chased fame and fortune and found it empty knows about the gilded chariot. The Buddha's teaching hits: it's beautiful, it's shining, and it's a TRAP. But you can break through like the moon through clouds. You can escape like a bird from the net. And that first step on the real path? Worth more than owning everything.
