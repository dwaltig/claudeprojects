# Chapter 21: Pakiṇṇakavagga (Miscellaneous)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Pakiṇṇakavagga

The twenty-first chapter of the Dhammapada gathers verses on diverse topics that resist easy categorization—hence "miscellaneous" (*pakiṇṇaka*). Yet a unifying thread runs through these teachings: the discernment required to distinguish true priorities from false ones. The chapter opens with strategic renunciation, moves through the dynamics of hatred and heedfulness, presents the famous "Six Recollections" (*cha anussati*) practiced by Gotama's disciples, and concludes with the solitary training that brings delight in forest retreat.

This chapter contains some of Buddhism's most counterintuitive verses—including the startling metaphor of "killing mother and father" (verses 294-295), which traditional commentary interprets as destroying craving and conceit, not actual patricide. Such shock-tactics demonstrate the Buddha's skillful use of language to break through conventional thinking.

### Verse 290: Strategic Renunciation

If by renouncing a small good one might see a greater good,
The wise one should renounce that small good,
Seeing the more extensive good.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Mattāsukha and Vipulasukha**: The verse contrasts *mattāsukha* (limited/small pleasure) with *vipulaṁ sukhaṁ* (extensive/great pleasure). This is not asceticism for its own sake but strategic discernment: sacrificing immediate gratification when a greater benefit beckons. The wise (*dhīra*) exercise *sampassaṁ* (clear seeing, discernment)—they perceive the long-term consequences of choices. Compare the economic concept of "opportunity cost": every choice forecloses alternatives. Buddhist wisdom weighs trade-offs across time and lives.

### Verse 291: The Trap of Hatred

One who desires happiness for oneself
By causing suffering for another,
Being thus associated with hatred,
Is not released from that hatred.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **Paradukkhūpadānena**: Literally "through laying down (causing) suffering for another." This verse exposes the self-defeating logic of pursuing happiness through others' pain. *Verasaṁsaggasaṁsaṭṭho* (entangled in association with hatred) describes how hostility breeds counter-hostility, creating an inescapable web. The one who harms others to advance themselves becomes *saṁsaṭṭha* (connected, entangled) with *vera* (hatred, enmity). Freedom (*parimuccati*) is impossible within such entanglement. This verse anticipates game theory insights: aggressive "win-lose" strategies often produce "lose-lose" cycles.

### Verses 292-293: The Heedless and the Mindful

**Verse 292**

That which should be done is cast aside,
What should not be done is done instead—
For the insolent and heedless,
Their pollutants increase.[3]

**Verse 293**

But for those who properly undertake
Mindfulness of the body constantly,
Who do not practice what should not be done,
Persisting in what should be done—
For those mindful, fully aware ones,
The pollutants come to rest.[4]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Kiccaṁ and Akiccaṁ**: *Kiccaṁ* (what should be done—duty, proper action) is *apaviddhaṁ* (rejected, cast aside), while *akiccaṁ* (what should not be done) is embraced. The *unnalā* (insolent, arrogant) and *pamatta* (heedless) thereby increase their *āsavā* (pollutants, fermentations)—the deep-seated defilements of sensuality, becoming, views, and ignorance that fuel rebirth.

[4] **Kāyagatā Sati**: Mindfulness of body (*kāyagatā sati*) is emphasized as the foundational practice. Those who are *sata* (mindful) and *sampajāna* (fully aware, comprehending clearly) reverse the pattern of verse 292. Their *āsavā* reach *attha* (cessation, completion)—the pollutants "go to rest." The contrast between these verses parallels the opening twin verses of Chapter 1: mental orientation determines karmic trajectory.

### Verses 294-295: The Paradoxical "Killings"

**Verse 294**

Having killed mother and father,
And two warrior kings,
Having killed a kingdom with its followers,
The brahmin proceeds untroubled.[5]

**Verse 295**

Having killed mother and father,
And two prosperous kings,
Having killed tiger as the fifth,
The brahmin proceeds untroubled.[6]

#### Footnotes

[5] **Metaphorical Parricide**: These shocking verses demand non-literal interpretation. The traditional commentary (*Aṭṭhakathā*) identifies: "mother" = craving (*taṇhā*, which gives birth to suffering); "father" = conceit (*māna*); "two warrior kings" = eternalism (*sassata-diṭṭhi*) and annihilationism (*uccheda-diṭṭhi*)—the two extreme views; "kingdom with followers" = the twelve sense bases (*āyatana*) with their attendant cravings. The *brāhmaṇa* (here meaning "one purified," the arahant) who destroys these proceeds *anīgha* (untroubled, without affliction). This use of paradox to shatter conventional thinking appears throughout Buddhist literature.

[6] **Veyyagghapañcama**: "Tiger as fifth" (*veyyagghapañcamaṁ*) is interpreted as the five hindrances (*nīvaraṇa*): sensual desire, ill-will, sloth-torpor, restlessness-worry, and doubt—with doubt being the "tiger" that devours clarity. Alternative readings take the "two kings" of this verse as different views: *sotthiye* (prosperous, safe) suggests attachment to comfortable beliefs. In either case, the verses demonstrate that liberation requires destroying not persons but mental defilements personified.

### Verses 296-301: The Six Recollections

These six verses share identical structure, each identifying how "Gotama's disciples always awake to a good awakening" (*suppabuddhaṁ pabujjhanti sadā Gotamasāvakā*) through constant practice of particular mindfulness. Together they constitute the *cha anussati*—six recollections central to Buddhist devotional and contemplative practice.

**Verse 296: Recollection of the Buddha**

Gotama's disciples always awake to a good awakening—
Those who day and night constantly have mindfulness of the Buddha.[7]

**Verse 297: Recollection of the Dhamma**

Gotama's disciples always awake to a good awakening—
Those who day and night constantly have mindfulness of the Dhamma.[8]

**Verse 298: Recollection of the Saṅgha**

Gotama's disciples always awake to a good awakening—
Those who day and night constantly have mindfulness of the Saṅgha.[9]

**Verse 299: Recollection of the Body**

Gotama's disciples always awake to a good awakening—
Those who day and night constantly have mindfulness of the body.[10]

**Verse 300: Recollection of Non-Violence**

Gotama's disciples always awake to a good awakening—
Those who day and night have a mind delighting in non-violence.[11]

**Verse 301: Recollection of Cultivation**

Gotama's disciples always awake to a good awakening—
Those who day and night have a mind delighting in cultivation.[12]

#### Footnotes

[7] **Buddhagatā Sati**: Mindfulness directed toward (*gatā*) the Buddha—recollecting the Awakened One's qualities: wisdom, compassion, teaching, liberation. This practice (*buddhānussati*) generates faith, inspiration, and protection of mind. *Suppabuddhaṁ pabujjhanti* plays on "Buddha" (awakened) and "pabujjhanti" (they awake)—a wordplay connecting the object of contemplation with its effect.

[8] **Dhammagatā Sati**: Recollection of the teaching (*dhammānussati*)—the truth, the path, the liberating doctrine. The Dhamma is praised as *svākkhāta* (well-proclaimed), *sandiṭṭhika* (visible here and now), *akālika* (immediate, timeless), *ehipassika* (inviting investigation), *opanayika* (leading onward), and *paccattaṁ veditabbo viññūhi* (to be known individually by the wise).

[9] **Saṅghagatā Sati**: Recollection of the community (*saṅghānussati*)—the noble disciples who have attained the fruits of the path. These three recollections (Buddha, Dhamma, Saṅgha) constitute the "Triple Gem" (*tiratana*) central to all Buddhist traditions.

[10] **Kāyagatā Sati**: This verse repeats the emphasis of verse 293. Mindfulness of body (*kāyānupassanā*) is the first of the four foundations of mindfulness (*satipaṭṭhāna*) and serves as the grounding practice for all contemplative development.

[11] **Ahiṁsāya Rato Mano**: A mind (*mano*) that *rato* (delights in, rejoices in) *ahiṁsā* (non-violence, non-harming). This is not merely abstaining from harm but actively cultivating delight in harmlessness—a positive orientation that protects against reactive hostility.

[12] **Bhāvanāya Rato Mano**: *Bhāvanā* encompasses all forms of mental cultivation—meditation, development of wholesome qualities, training of mind. A mind that delights in cultivation naturally inclines toward practice rather than distraction.

### Verse 302: The Difficulty of Both Paths

The going forth is hard, it is hard to find delight therein;
Hard too are households, suffering to dwell within.
Dwelling with those different is suffering;
Travelers in saṃsāra are beset by suffering.
Therefore, do not be a traveler;
Do not be one beset by suffering.[13]

#### Footnotes

[13] **Duppabbajjaṁ Durabhiramaṁ**: This lengthy verse acknowledges universal suffering: monastic life (*pabbajjā*, "going forth") is *duppa-* (hard, difficult), and finding delight (*abhirama*) therein is also hard. But household life (*ghara*, *āvāsa*) is equally suffering (*dukhā*). *Dusamānasaṁvāso* (dwelling with those of different mind/character) produces friction. The solution? Cease being an *addhagū* (traveler, wanderer) in *saṃsāra*—end the cycle entirely. This verse honestly acknowledges that no saṃsāric situation is satisfactory; the problem is conditioned existence itself, not merely the wrong circumstances.

### Verse 303: The Faithful One Honored

The faithful one endowed with virtue,
Possessed of wealth and fame—
Whatever district they resort to,
Right there they are worshipped.[14]

#### Footnotes

[14] **Saddho Sīlena Sampanno**: One possessing *saddhā* (faith, confidence) and *sīla* (virtue, moral conduct), along with *yasas* (fame, reputation) and *bhoga* (wealth, resources), receives *pūjā* (honor, worship) everywhere. This verse describes the wholesome integration of material and spiritual success—not renunciation but righteous prosperity. The truly virtuous person inspires respect universally; their qualities transcend local customs.

---

### Verse 304: The Visible and Invisible

The good are visible from afar,
Like a mountain covered in snow.
The wicked are not seen here,
Like arrows shot in the night.[15]

#### Footnotes

[15] **Himavanta Simile**: *Santo* (the good, the peaceful) *pakāsenti* (shine forth, are visible) *dūre* (from far away), compared to snow-capped *Himavanta* (the Himalayas). Such figures stand out in any landscape; their virtue is unmistakable. Conversely, *asanta* (the bad, unpeaceful) are *na dissanti* (not seen)—invisible like *sarā* (arrows) *khittā* (shot) *rattiṁ* (in the night). The wicked operate in darkness, their movements hidden. This verse invites reflection: which visibility characterizes me?

---

### Verse 305: Solitary Delight

Sitting alone, lying down alone,
Walking alone, diligent—
The solitary one who trains themselves
Will delight in the edge of the forest.[16]

#### Footnotes

[16] **Eko and Vananta**: *Ekāsana* (sitting alone), *ekaseyya* (lying alone), *eko caram* (walking alone), *atandito* (diligent, unwearied)—the description emphasizes complete physical and social solitude. *Eko damayam-attānaṁ* (the one alone training oneself) finds *ramito* (delight, pleasure) in *vananta* (the forest's edge, the wilderness). This is not alienation but the joy discovered when external distraction ceases and internal cultivation deepens. The "forest's edge" (*vananta*) suggests the transitional zone where society ends and nature begins—a liminal space conducive to transformation.

### Historical Context

The *pakiṇṇaka* ("miscellaneous") classification likely reflects editorial decisions during the text's compilation rather than thematic disunity. These verses may have circulated independently before being gathered here. The shocking metaphors of verses 294-295 demonstrate how Buddhist teachers used provocative language to challenge conventional thinking—a technique that would later flourish in Chan/Zen literature.
