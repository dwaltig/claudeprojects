# Chapter 6: Paṇḍitavagga (The Wise)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Paṇḍitavagga

The sixth chapter presents *paṇḍita* (the wise)—the counterpart to Chapter 5's fool. If the fool refuses to learn, the wise person actively seeks correction. If the fool is shaken by circumstances, the wise stands firm like rock. Fourteen verses outline the wise person's companions, qualities, equanimity, and ultimate liberation.

### Verses 76-78: The Wise Choose Companions Carefully

**Verse 76**

One should regard someone who reveals your faults  
As one who points out hidden treasure.  
Keep company with such a sagacious person who reproves you—  
For doing so is better, not worse.[1]

**Verse 77**

One should advise and instruct,  
And forbid whatever is vile.  
Such a one is dear to the good,  
But not dear to the bad.[2]

**Verse 78**

Do not keep company with wicked friends,  
Do not keep company with the ignoble.  
Keep company with spiritual friends,  
Keep company with superior people.[3]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Fault-Finders as Treasure**: *Nidhīnaṁ va pavattāra* (like one who points out treasure). Most flee criticism; the wise seek it. One who shows our faults (*vajjadassi*) performs a valuable service—revealing what we could not see alone. *Seyyo hoti na pāpiyo* (surely better, not worse) emphasizes the paradox.

[2] **The Good Teacher's Unpopularity**: The one who advises (*ovadeyya*), instructs (*anusāseyya*), and forbids wrong (*asabbhā nivāraye*) is *piyo* (dear) to the good (*santa*) but *appiyo* (not dear) to the bad. Genuine teachers make enemies among those who prefer flattery.

[3] **Kalyāṇamitta (Spiritual Friend)**: *Mitte kalyāṇe* (spiritual friends) is a technical term in Buddhism—the Buddha declared *kalyāṇamittatā* (spiritual friendship) to be "the whole of the holy life." The fourfold structure (*na bhaje...na bhaje...bhajetha...bhajetha*) emphasizes active choice: avoid the wicked twice, seek the good twice.

### Verses 79-80: Drinking Dhamma, Mastering Self

**Verse 79**

One who drinks Dhamma lives well,  
With a clear mind;  
The wise one always delights  
In the Dhamma made known by the Noble Ones.[4]

**Verse 80**

Course-makers lead water;  
Fletchers straighten arrows;  
Carpenters straighten wood;  
The wise master themselves.[5]

#### Footnotes

[4] **Dhammapīti (Drinking Dhamma)**: *Pīti* (drinking, absorbing) suggests deep internalization—not intellectual study but drinking in wisdom as one drinks water. *Vippasannena cetasā* (with clear mind)—the result is mental clarity, not confusion.

[5] **Craftsmen's Training**: Three craftsmen metaphors show training's universality: *nettikā* lead water, *usukārā* straighten arrows, *tacchakā* shape wood. The climax: *attānaṁ damayanti paṇḍitā* (the wise master themselves). The self is the ultimate material requiring skillful shaping.

### Verses 81-82: Rock and Lake

**Verse 81**

Just as solid rock is not shaken by the wind,  
So the wise are not moved by blame or praise.[6]

**Verse 82**

Like a lake that is deep, clear, and unruffled,  
So the wise become calm after hearing Dhamma.[7]

#### Footnotes

[6] **The Rock Simile**: *Selo yathā ekaghano* (like solid, single-mass rock). *Nindāpasaṁsā* (blame and praise) are two of the eight worldly winds (*lokadhamma*—gain/loss, fame/infamy, praise/blame, pleasure/pain). The wise remain *na samiñjanti* (unmoved, unshaken) by either.

[7] **The Lake Simile**: *Rahado gambhīro vippasanno anāvilo* (deep, clear, unruffled lake) conveys the wise mind's quality—not shallow reactivity but deep stability. *Vippasīdanti* (become clear/confident) after hearing Dhamma, rather than stirred up.

### Verse 83: Equanimity in All Conditions

**Verse 83**

True people everywhere renounce;  
The good do not chatter about sense desires.  
When touched by pleasure or suffering,  
The wise show neither elation nor depression.[8]

#### Footnotes

[8] **Transcending Pairs**: *Sabbattha cajanti* (renounce everywhere)—not attachment to any situation. *Sukhena phuṭṭhā atha vā dukhena* (touched by pleasure or suffering) describes inevitable experience; *n'occāvacaṁ dassayanti* (show neither ups nor downs) describes the wise response. Equanimity is the hallmark.

### Verse 84: Neither for Self nor Other

**Verse 84**

Not for one's own sake nor another's  
Should one desire child, riches, or kingdom.  
One should not desire success through corruption;  
One should be virtuous, wise, and righteous.[9]

#### Footnotes

[9] **Comprehensive Renunciation**: *Na attahetu na parassa hetu* (not for self, not for other) eliminates both selfishness and misguided altruism as motivations. The list—child (*putta*), riches (*dhana*), kingdom (*raṭṭha*)—covers family, wealth, power. *Adhammena samiddhi* (success through corruption) is specifically rejected.

### Verses 85-86: Few Cross to the Other Shore

**Verse 85**

Among humans, few go beyond;  
The rest run along the near shore.

**Verse 86**

Those who live righteously  
According to the well-taught Dhamma—  
They will go beyond Death's realm,  
So hard to cross.[10]

#### Footnotes

[10] **The River Crossing**: *Pāragāmino* (those who go beyond) is a classic image for liberation—crossing the river of samsara to *pāra* (the far shore, beyond). Most people (*itarā pajā*) merely *tīram evānudhāvati* (run along the bank)—busy but never crossing. *Maccudheyya suduttara* (Death's realm, very hard to cross) awaits most; only followers of Dhamma pass over.

### Verses 87-89: Renunciation and Liberation

**Verse 87**

Having abandoned the dark state,  
The wise one should develop the bright;  
Having gone from home to homelessness,  
In solitude, where delight is hard.[11]

**Verse 88**

One should desire to delight in that (solitude),  
Having given up sense pleasures, possessing nothing.  
The wise one should purify the self  
Of mental defilements.[12]

**Verse 89**

Those who have well-developed minds  
In the factors of complete awakening,  
Who delight in non-attachment,  
Having given up grasping—  
Pollutant-free, shining forth—  
They are emancipated in the world.[13]

#### Footnotes

[11] **The Difficult Solitude**: *Kaṇha dhamma* (dark state) versus *sukka* (bright)—the wise abandon one and develop the other. *Okā anoka* (from home to homelessness)—monastic renunciation. *Viveke yattha dūrama* (in solitude, where it is hard to delight)—honest acknowledgment that solitude is difficult, not romantic.

[12] **Purification Practice**: *Akiñcano* (possessing nothing) and *hitvā kāme* (having given up sense pleasures) are prerequisites for *pariyodapeyya attāna cittaklesehi* (purifying the self of mental defilements). The work is internal, not external.

[13] **The Shining Ones**: *Sambodhi-aṅgesu* (factors of awakening) are the seven factors: mindfulness, investigation, effort, rapture, tranquility, concentration, equanimity. *Khīṇāsava* (pollutant-free)—the āsavas (taints of sensuality, becoming, ignorance) are destroyed. *Jutimanto* (shining forth) and *parinibbutā* (emanicipated)—the final state of the wise.
