# Chapter 23: Nāgavagga (The Elephant)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Nāgavagga

The twenty-third chapter employs the elephant (*nāga*) as its central metaphor—an animal that held special significance in Indian culture as symbol of strength, nobility, patience, and trainability. The Buddha himself was compared to an elephant, and his great going-forth was said to occur on the full moon of the elephant month.

This chapter develops the metaphor in multiple directions: the trained elephant as model of self-discipline, the elephant in battle as exemplar of patience under abuse, the solitary forest elephant as ideal of spiritual independence, and the elephant in musth as image of the untamed mind requiring control. The teaching moves from endurance through self-training to the possibility of noble solitude—and concludes with an enumeration of genuine goods (*sukha*).

### Verse 320: Endurance Like a Battle Elephant

Like an elephant in battle
Endures an arrow shot from bow,
So shall I endure abuse—
For many people are unvirtuous.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Nāgo va Saṅgāme**: The *nāga* (elephant) in *saṅgāma* (battle, combat) endures *sara* (arrows) *patitaṁ* (fallen, shot) *cāpāto* (from the bow). This becomes the model for *titikkhissaṁ* (I will endure, I will be patient with) *ativākyaṁ* (abuse, harsh words, verbal attack). The reason for such endurance is pragmatic: *dussīlo hi bahujjano* ("for many people are unvirtuous"). Expecting others to be virtuous leads to constant disappointment and reactive anger. The wise accept that many will speak harshly—and prepare to endure like the battle elephant, massive and unmoved.

### Verses 321-323: The Value of Self-Training

**Verse 321**

They lead one trained into a crowd;
A king mounts one who has been trained.
Amongst humans, the trained one is best—
The one who can endure abuse.[2]

**Verse 322**

Noble are the well-trained horses,
The well-bred horses from Sindh,
And the great tusker elephants—
But more noble still is one who has trained themselves.[3]

**Verse 323**

Not by these vehicles can one go
To the destination beyond destinations—
As one, through training oneself well,
Being trained, goes by that training.[4]

#### Footnotes

[2] **Dantaṁ Nayanti Samitiṁ**: The *danta* (trained, tamed) elephant is *nayanti* (led) into *samiti* (assembly, crowd)—it can be trusted in public. The *rāja* (king) *abhirūhati* (mounts) only a trained elephant. By extension, the person who is *danta* (trained in self-restraint) and can *titikkhati* (endure) *ativākyaṁ* (abuse) is *seṭṭha* (best, chief) among *manussesu* (humans). Character proven under stress commands respect.

[3] **Attadanto Tato Varaṁ**: Even noble beasts—*assatarā* (mules/horses), *ājānīyā Sindhavā* (thoroughbred Sindhi horses renowned for quality), *kuñjarā mahānāgā* (great tusker elephants)—are surpassed (*tato varaṁ*, "more noble than that") by the *attadanta* (self-trained). External creatures, however magnificent, cannot equal the human being who has achieved self-mastery.

[4] **Agataṁ Disaṁ**: The *agatā disā* (the "un-gone region," the place not yet reached—i.e., *nibbāna*) cannot be reached by physical *yāna* (vehicles, conveyances). Only *sudantena attanā* (by the well-trained self), *danto dantena* ("trained by the training"), does one *gacchati* (go). The verse emphasizes that liberation is achieved through internal transformation, not external transport.

### Verse 324: The Elephant Remembers the Forest

The tusker named Dhanapālaka,
Musty in rut and difficult to restrain,
Though bound, does not eat even a morsel—
The tusker remembers the elephant forest.[5]

#### Footnotes

[5] **Dhanapālaka and Nāgavana**: This verse draws on a specific elephant story known in Buddhist tradition. *Dhanapālaka* ("guardian of wealth") was a famous elephant captured from the wild. Despite being *kaṭukappabhedana* (in fierce musth—the aggressive state of male elephants in rut) and *dunnivāraya* (hard to restrain), when *baddha* (bound, captured) he refuses food (*kabalaṁ na bhuñjati*, "doesn't eat a morsel"). Why? He *sumarati* (remembers well) the *nāgavana* (elephant forest)—his wild home. The verse serves as analogy: the practitioner, caught in saṃsāra, should remember their true home (liberation) with such intensity that worldly pleasures lose their appeal.

### Verse 325: The Torpid Fool

When one is torpid and overeats,
Sleepy, rolling on the bed,
Like a great pig fed on fodder—
That fool comes to the womb again.[6]

#### Footnotes

[6] **Mahāvarāho va Nivāpapuṭṭho**: The contrast with the elephant is sharp. One who is *middhī* (torpid, sluggish), *mahagghasa* (eating much, gluttonous), *niddāyitā* (sleepy), *samparivattasāyī* (rolling on the bed) resembles not the noble elephant but the *mahāvarāha* (great pig) *nivāpapuṭṭha* (fed on fodder). Such a *manda* (fool) *punappunaṁ* (again and again) *upeti gabbhaṁ* (enters the womb)—is endlessly reborn. The image is deliberately unflattering: while the elephant embodies nobility and self-restraint, the pig represents wallowing indulgence.

### Verse 326: Controlling the Mind

Formerly this wandering mind wandered
Through desire, pleasure, and delight,
But today I shall control it wisely—
Like the man with goad controls an elephant in musth.[7]

#### Footnotes

[7] **Hatthim-pabhinnaṁ**: The *citta* (mind) is compared to *hatthī pabhinna* (an elephant in musth—the state of aggressive, dangerous unpredictability caused by hormonal surge). It *acāri cārikaṁ* (wandered in wandering)—unconstrained, running wherever *icchaka* (desire), *kāma* (pleasure), and *sukha* (happiness) directed. But *ajja* (today) the practitioner resolves to *niggahessāmi yoniso* (control it wisely, restrain it skillfully), like an *aṅkusaggaha* (goad-holder, elephant trainer) manages a dangerous beast. The verse marks a decisive turn from indulgence to discipline.

### Verse 327: Rising from the Pit

You should delight in heedfulness;
You should always protect your mind.
Raise yourself from this difficult ground—
Like a tusker sunk in mud.[8]

#### Footnotes

[8] **Paṅke Sanno va Kuñjaro**: Be *appamādaratā* (delighting in heedfulness); *anurakkhatha* (protect) *sacittaṁ* (your own mind). Then *uddharatha attānaṁ* (raise yourself) from the *dugga* (difficult ground, pit, mire). The simile: *kuñjaro* (tusker) *sanno* (sunk) *paṅke* (in mud). Elephants occasionally become trapped in mud, requiring tremendous effort to extract themselves. The spiritual lesson: saṃsāric mire traps us, but with energetic effort we can lift ourselves out.

### Verses 328-330: The Question of Companions

**Verse 328**

If you should find a prudent friend,
A companion who lives well and wisely,
Overcoming all your troubles,
You should live with that one—glad and mindful.[9]

**Verse 329**

But if you do not find a prudent friend,
A companion who lives well and wisely,
Like a king who abandons his conquered kingdom—
One should live alone, like a solitary elephant in the forest.[10]

**Verse 330**

Better to live alone—
There can be no friendship with a fool.
Living alone, one should do no wrong,
Unconcerned, like a solitary elephant in the forest.[11]

#### Footnotes

[9] **Nipakaṁ Sahāyaṁ**: If one *labhetha* (obtains, finds) a *nipaka* (prudent, wise) *sahāya* (friend, companion) who is *sādhuvihārin* (lives well) and *dhīra* (wise), then *abhibhuyya* (overcoming) *sabbāni parissayāni* (all troubles, dangers), one should *careyya* (live) *attamano* (glad, pleased) and *satīmā* (mindful). Good companionship supports practice.

[10] **Mātaṅgaraññe va Nāgo**: If no such companion is found, the alternative is dramatic: like a *rāja* (king) who *pahāya* (abandons) his *vijitaṁ raṭṭhaṁ* (conquered kingdom), one should *eko care* (dwell alone) like a *nāga* (elephant) in the *mātaṅgarañña* (elephant-forest, wilderness). The image suggests that solitude, when necessary, is preferable to compromised association.

[11] **Natthi Bāle Sahāyatā**: *Sahāyatā* (companionship, friendship) with a *bāla* (fool) is *natthi* (non-existent, impossible)—fools cannot be true friends because friendship requires wisdom. Better to *eko care* (live alone), *na pāpāni kayirā* (not do evil), *appossukko* (unconcerned, without anxiety), like the solitary forest elephant. These three verses together present a graduated teaching: seek wise companions if available; if not, honorable solitude surpasses foolish company.

### Verses 331-333: The Enumeration of Goods

**Verse 331**

Friends are good when need arises;
Contentment with whatever one has is good;
Merit at life's end is good;
The abandoning of all suffering is good.[12]

**Verse 332**

Respecting mother is good in the world;
Also respecting father is good;
Respecting ascetics is good in the world;
Also respecting true brahmins is good.[13]

**Verse 333**

Moral conduct until old age is good;
The establishment of faith is good;
The acquisition of wisdom is good;
Refraining from evil is good.[14]

#### Footnotes

[12] **Atthamhi Jātamhi Sukhā Sahāyā**: When *attha* (need, necessity) *jātamhi* (has arisen), *sahāyā* (friends) are *sukhā* (good, pleasant, beneficial). *Tuṭṭhī* (contentment) *itarītarena* (with whatever) is good. *Puññaṁ* (merit) *jīvitasaṅkhayamhi* (at life's dissolution) is good—accumulated goodness helps at death. Finally, *sabbassa dukkhassa pahāṇaṁ* (the abandoning of all suffering)—ultimate liberation—is *sukhaṁ* (good). The verse moves from conventional goods (friendship, contentment) to ultimate good (liberation).

[13] **Matteyyatā and Petteyyatā**: *Matteyyatā* (respecting mother) and *petteyyatā* (respecting father) are *sukhā* (good) in the *loka* (world). Similarly, respecting *samaṇa* (ascetics, renunciants) and *brāhmaṇa* (brahmins—here meaning genuine spiritual practitioners, not merely caste identity) is good. These represent the vertical dimension of ethics: honoring those above us in age, sacrifice, and spiritual attainment.

[14] **Sīlaṁ Yāva Jarā Sukhaṁ**: *Sīla* (moral conduct, virtue) *yāva jarā* (until old age) is *sukhaṁ* (good)—lifelong ethics, not temporary restraint. *Saddhā patiṭṭhitā* (established faith) is good. *Paññāya paṭilābho* (acquisition of wisdom) is good. *Pāpānaṁ akaraṇaṁ* (non-doing of evil) is *sukhaṁ*. The chapter concludes with these affirmations of fundamental Buddhist values.

### Historical Context

Elephants were central to Indian life—in war, ceremony, labor, and imagination. The Buddha's contemporaries would have known elephant behavior intimately. The *musth* elephant (*pabhinna*) was genuinely dangerous, making the metaphor of mind-as-wild-elephant viscerally compelling. The *Dhanapālaka* story (verse 324) appears in the commentarial tradition as example of longing for one's true home—a theme that would later flourish in Pure Land Buddhism's imagery of exile and return.
