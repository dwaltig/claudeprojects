# Chapter 12: Attavagga - Blues Edition
## The Self: Nobody Can Purify You But You

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

The self. Your best friend or your worst enemy. By yourself is evil done, by yourself are you defiled. By yourself is evil left undone, by yourself are you purified. Nobody—not mama, not a preacher, not a savior—can clean you up. That's the Buddha's radical truth: you do it yourself or it doesn't get done.

### Verses 157-160: Guard Yourself, Train Yourself

**The Blues Truth:**

If you love yourself, love yourself,  
Guard yourself right well.  
Watch through the night, watch through the night—  
The wise one stays alert.

First get yourself right, get yourself right,  
THEN teach somebody else.  
Train yourself first, train yourself first—  
Then you got something to help.

Self is hard to train, hard to train,  
But do yourself what you teach.  
Be what you preach, be what you preach—  
That's how the teaching can reach.

The self is the friend of self, friend of self—  
What other friend you got?  
When you train yourself well, train yourself well,  
You find a friend worth a lot.

**Blues Notes:** *Attā hi attano nātho* (self is the friend/protector of self). No one can do the work for you. The trained self becomes your own best companion.

### Verses 161-162: Evil Crushes Itself

**The Blues Truth:**

Evil done by yourself, by yourself,  
Born in you, rising in you—  
Crushes the fool, crushes the fool,  
Like diamond crushing through.

Like a vine on a Sāl tree, Sāl tree,  
Strangling what holds it up—  
Covering yourself with lack of virtue  
Makes you your enemy's pup.

You become what your enemy wants,  
You become what your enemy wants,  
When you strangle yourself with wrong.

**Blues Notes:** *Attanā va kataṁ pāpaṁ* (evil done by oneself) crushes oneself—no external enemy needed. The *māluvā* (strangling vine) kills its host tree: self-destruction through unvirtue.

### Verses 163-165: No One Can Purify Another

**The Blues Truth:**

Easy to do what's no good, no good,  
Easy to do what harms you.  
What's beneficial, what's right, what's true?  
THAT'S the hard thing to pursue.

Revile the teaching, mock the Dhamma,  
Laugh at those who live it true—  
You bring destruction on yourself  
Like bamboo when it fruits through.

BUT HERE'S THE TRUTH, THE DEEPEST TRUTH:

By yourself is evil done, evil done.  
By yourself are you defiled.  
By yourself is evil NOT done, NOT done.  
By yourself are you purified.

Purity and impurity—  
They come from YOU alone.  
No one can purify another.  
NO ONE CAN PURIFY ANOTHER.  
This work is yours to own.

**Blues Notes:** *Suddhī asuddhī paccattaṁ, nāñño aññaṁ visodhaye* (purity and impurity are one's own; no one can purify another). Buddhism's most radical ethical statement. No savior can do it for you.

### Verse 166: Know Your Own Good

**The Blues Truth:**

Don't neglect your own good, your own good,  
For another's, however great.  
Know what's good for you, good for you,  
Be intent on that estate.

Take care of yourself first, yourself first,  
So you can help somebody else.  
Not selfish—just wise.  
First put on your own mask.

**Blues Notes:** *Atta-d-atthaṁ paratthena na hāpaye* (don't neglect your own good for another's). Not selfishness—recognizing that without self-cultivation, you can't help others.

## End of Chapter 12: The Self

**What We Learned:**

1. If you love yourself, guard yourself
2. Train yourself FIRST, then teach others
3. Self is the friend of self—what other friend is there?
4. Self-done evil crushes like a diamond
5. Lack of virtue is a strangling vine
6. Easy to do what's wrong; hard to do what's right
7. BY YOURSELF is evil done, by yourself defiled
8. BY YOURSELF is evil NOT done, by yourself purified
9. NO ONE CAN PURIFY ANOTHER
10. Know your own good and pursue it

By yourself is the work done.  
By yourself is the freedom won.  
Nobody else, nobody else—  
You do it or it doesn't get done.

**Blues Notes on Translation Method:**

The Blues knows about self-reliance. Nobody's coming to save you. You pick yourself up off the floor, you face your demons, you do the work. The Buddha's teaching here matches exactly: *nāñño aññaṁ visodhaye*—no one can purify another. That's not cold; that's empowering. The power is in YOUR hands.
