# Chapter 20: Maggavagga - Blues Edition
## The Path: There Is No Other

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

THE PATH. The Eightfold Path is best. There is no other path for insight and purity. Enter it or stay lost. This chapter has the Three Marks of Existence—impermanence, suffering, non-self—and the urgent warning: death comes like a flood on a sleeping village. No children, no father, no kin can save you. Walk the path NOW.

### Verses 273-276: This Is THE Path

**The Blues Truth:**

Eightfold Path is best, is best.  
Four Truths are best of all.  
Passionlessness is the best state.  
The Buddha's the best who stands tall.

THIS is the path, THIS is the path—  
There is no other way.  
Enter this path for insight and purity—  
This confounds Māra's sway.

Enter this path, you'll end suffering.  
I declared this path to you.  
Remove the dart with knowledge—  
That's what the awakened do.

Your duty is ARDOR, ardor.  
The Buddhas just point the way.  
Meditators who walk this path  
Break free from Māra's play.

**Blues Notes:** *Eso va maggo natthañño* (THIS is the path, no other). *Tumhehi kiccaṁ ātappaṁ* (your duty is ardor). The Buddha points; YOU walk.

### Verses 277-279: The Three Marks

**The Blues Truth:**

All conditions are IMPERMANENT.  
See this with wisdom, and you'll be free.  
Grow tired of suffering, tired of suffering—  
This is the path to purity.

All conditions are SUFFERING.  
See this with wisdom, and you'll be free.  
Grow tired of suffering, tired of suffering—  
This is the path to purity.

All dhammas are WITHOUT SELF.  
See this with wisdom, and you'll be free.  
Grow tired of suffering, tired of suffering—  
This is the path to purity.

Impermanent. Suffering. No-self.  
Three marks, three marks, three marks—  
See any one deeply, and you'll walk  
Out of the suffering's arcs.

### Verses 280-285: Cut the Forest, Not Just the Tree

**The Blues Truth:**

The lazy one—young, strong, but sluggish,  
Mind lacking right intent—  
Does NOT find wisdom's path, wisdom's path.  
All that energy misspent.

Guard your speech, restrain your mind,  
Don't do wrong with the body.  
Three paths of action to purify—  
That's the path shown by the godly.

From effort wisdom rises;  
Without effort wisdom dies.  
Know these two paths of growth and decline—  
Set yourself where wisdom flies.

Cut the FOREST, not just a tree!  
The forest is where danger hides.  
Cut the forest AND the thicket—  
Be without where craving resides.

As long as ANY desire for another  
Holds even an atom's weight,  
The mind stays bound, stays bound—  
Like a calf to mother's milk estate.

Cut off self-affection, self-affection!  
Like plucking an autumn lotus clean.  
Develop the path to peace, to peace—  
Nibbāna that the Buddha has seen.

### Verses 286-289: Death Comes Like a Flood

**The Blues Truth:**

"I'll stay here for the rains,  
Here for winter and summer too"—  
So thinks the fool, the fool,  
Not seeing danger breaking through.

The one attached to children, cattle,  
Mind besotted and caught—  
Snatched by death, snatched by death,  
Like a sleeping village death has brought.

Children can't save you.  
Father can't save you.  
Kin can't save you.  
When the End-Maker comes for you.

Knowing this, knowing this—  
The wise one, endowed with virtue,  
Should QUICKLY purify the path,  
The path to Nibbāna, the path that's true.
