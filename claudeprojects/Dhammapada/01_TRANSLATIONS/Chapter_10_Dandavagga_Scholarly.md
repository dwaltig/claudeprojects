# Chapter 10: Daṇḍavagga (Violence / The Rod)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Daṇḍavagga

The tenth chapter addresses *daṇḍa* (the rod/stick)—violence, punishment, and harm. Opening with Buddhism's ethical core (all tremble at violence, all love life), it progresses through consequences of harm and the path of nonviolence. The broken gong simile and ten punishments passage are particularly memorable.

### Verses 129-130: All Tremble at Violence

**Verse 129**

Everyone trembles at violence;  
Everyone fears death.  
Comparing oneself with others,  
One should not strike or have others strike.

**Verse 130**

Everyone trembles at violence;  
For everyone, life is dear.  
Comparing oneself with others,  
One should not strike or have others strike.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Buddhism's Golden Rule**: *Attānaṁ upamaṁ katvā* (comparing oneself with others) is the practical method—feel how you would feel, then act accordingly. *Na haneyya na ghātaye* (don't strike, don't have struck)—both direct violence and commissioning violence are forbidden. The near-identical verses emphasize universality through repetition.

### Verses 131-132: Harm Brings No Happiness

**Verse 131**

One who harms with the rod  
Beings who desire happiness,  
While seeking happiness for oneself,  
Will find no happiness after death.

**Verse 132**

One who harms not with the rod  
Beings who desire happiness,  
While seeking happiness for oneself,  
Will find happiness after death.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **The Happiness Paradox**: All beings are *sukhakāmā* (desiring happiness). Harming them while seeking your own happiness is self-defeating: *pecca so na labhate sukhaṁ* (won't find happiness after death). The twin verses create stark contrast: harm → no happiness; nonharm → happiness.

### Verses 133-134: Harsh Speech and the Broken Gong

**Verse 133**

Speak no harsh word to anyone;  
Spoken to, they may answer back.  
Arrogant talk brings misery,  
And they may strike you with the rod.

**Verse 134**

If you make no sound  
Like a broken gong,  
You have attained Nibbāna—  
Contention is not found in you.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **The Broken Gong**: *Kaṁso upahato* (broken gong) produces no sound when struck. The practitioner who doesn't "resound" with anger when struck has *pattosi Nibbānaṁ* (attained Nibbāna), having eliminated *sārambha* (contention, quarrelsomeness). This is active nonreactivity, not suppression.

### Verse 135: Old Age and Death Drive Us

**Verse 135**

As a cowherd with a stick  
Drives cattle to pasture,  
So do old age and death  
Drive life out of beings.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **The Cowherd Simile**: *Gopālo gāvo pāceti gocaraṁ* (cowherd drives cattle to pasture)—inevitable, methodical, relentless. *Jarā ca maccu ca* (old age and death) similarly drive all beings toward their end. This is not fatalism but motivation: awareness of death encourages ethical urgency.

### Verses 137-140: Ten Punishments for Violence

**Verses 137-140**

Whoever with the rod offends  
Those who are inoffensive and harmless  
Will quickly fall into one of ten states:

Harsh physical pain;  
Loss of wealth;  
Bodily breakdown;  
Heavy affliction;  
Loss of mind;  
Danger from the king;  
Terrible slander;  
Loss of relatives;  
Destruction of possessions;  
Houses consumed by fire.

And at death, that foolish one  
Arises in the underworld.[5]

#### Footnotes

[5] **Karma's Specific Fruits**: Ten consequences for harming the harmless: *vedanā pharusā* (harsh feelings/pain), *jāni* (loss), *sarīrassa bhedana* (bodily breakdown), *garuka ābādha* (heavy affliction), *cittakkhep* (mental breakdown), *rājato upassagga* (royal danger), *abbhakkhāna* (slander), *ñātīnaṁ parikkhaya* (loss of kin), *bhogānaṁ pabhaṅgura* (wealth destruction), *aggi ḍahati agārāni* (fire burns houses). Plus rebirth in the underworld.

### Verses 141-142: True Purification

**Verse 141**

Not going naked, nor matted hair, nor mud,  
Nor fasting, nor lying on stony ground,  
Nor dust and dirt, nor squatting exertions  
Can purify one who has not removed doubt.

**Verse 142**

Even if adorned, if one is peaceful,  
Trained, settled, living the holy life,  
Having laid down the rod toward all beings—  
That one is a brahmin, an ascetic, a monastic.[6]

#### Footnotes

[6] **External vs. Internal Markers**: Verse 141 lists ascetic practices that don't purify: nakedness, matted hair, mud, fasting, lying on stones, dust, squatting. Verse 142 offers the counterpoint: even wearing ornaments, one who is *santo danto* (peaceful, trained) and *nidhāya daṇḍaṁ sabbesu bhūtesu* (has laid down the rod toward all beings) is the true renunciant.

### Verses 143-145: The Good Horse

**Verse 143**

Rare is the person in this world  
Who is restrained by conscience,  
Aware of their faults—  
Like a good horse restrained by the whip.

**Verse 144**

Like a good horse touched by the whip,  
Be ardent and spiritually intense.  
With faith, virtue, energy,  
Concentration, and Dhamma investigation—  
With understanding, good conduct, and mindfulness—  
Abandon this not-insignificant suffering.

**Verse 145**

Course-makers lead water;  
Fletchers straighten arrows;  
Carpenters straighten wood;  
The mild master themselves.[7]

#### Footnotes

[7] **Self-Mastery**: The horse metaphor returns: a good horse needs only the lightest touch. The verse lists *saddhā, sīla, viriya, samādhi, dhammavinicchaya* (faith, virtue, energy, concentration, Dhamma investigation)—essentially the five faculties. Verse 145 repeats the craftsmen metaphor from Chapter 6: *subbatā attānaṁ damayanti* (the mild master themselves).
