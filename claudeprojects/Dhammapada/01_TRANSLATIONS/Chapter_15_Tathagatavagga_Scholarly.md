# Chapter 15: Tathagatavagga (The Tathagata)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Tathagatavagga

The fifteenth chapter (in this reconstructed 28-chapter edition) separates the specific doctrinal formulas from the general praise of the Buddha found in the previous chapter. It contains the central definitions of the Buddhist path: the Three Refuges (Verses 188-192) and the merit of honoring the Awakened (Verses 193-196).

### Verses 188-192: The Three Refuges

**Verse 188**

Many people shaken by fear  
Go for refuge to mountains and forests,  
To tree-shrines in pleasure parks.

**Verses 189-192**

That is not a secure refuge;  
That is not the supreme refuge;  
Coming to that refuge  
Does not liberate from all suffering.

But whoever has gone for refuge  
To the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha,  
And sees with right wisdom  
The Four Noble Truths:

Suffering, the arising of suffering,  
The overcoming of suffering,  
The Noble Eightfold Path  
Leading to the stilling of suffering—

THAT is a secure refuge;  
THAT is the supreme refuge.  
Coming to that refuge  
Liberates from all suffering.[6]

#### Footnotes

[6] **The Triple Gem**: The famous refuge formula. Mountains and forests don't liberate; Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha do. But refuge is not passive faith—it includes *sammappaññāya passati* (seeing with right wisdom) the Four Noble Truths.

### Verses 193-196: The Buddha's Arising

**Verse 193**

A person of noble breed is rare,  
Not born everywhere.  
Wherever that wise one is born,  
That family gains happiness.

**Verse 194**

Good is the arising of Buddhas;  
Good is the teaching of True Dhamma;  
Good is the harmony of the Sangha;  
Good is devotion to harmony.

**Verses 195-196**

Those who worship the worthy—  
Whether Buddhas or disciples,  
Who have overcome impediments,  
Crossed over grief and lamentation—

For those who worship such fearless ones,  
The emancipated—  
No one can measure their merit.[7]

#### Footnotes

[7] **Immeasurable Merit**: The chapter ends with praise of those who honor the awakened. *Na sakkā puññaṁ saṅkhātuṁ* (no one can count the merit)—worshipping the liberated generates incalculable good.
