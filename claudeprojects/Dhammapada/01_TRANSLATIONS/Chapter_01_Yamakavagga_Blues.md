## The Twin Verses: When the Truth Comes in Pairs

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

## The Professor's Translation Review

**What the Professor Got Right:**

Dr. Patel nailed it, people. His scholarly translation captures the doctrinal precision of these verses—the mind-primacy teaching, the psychological mechanics of karma, the crucial distinction between knowing and doing. His footnotes bring the philosophical depth: this ain't just folk wisdom, it's a complete psychology of liberation.

Particularly strong:
- The opening verses on mind being the boss of everything
- The explanation of how dwelling on grievances keeps hatred alive
- The heartwood/sapwood metaphor for true vs. false values
- The recognition that karma is psychological causation, not cosmic accounting

**What to Emphasize in the Blues Version:**

The Professor gives us the map—now I gotta make it SING. These teachings need to land in the gut, not just the brain. The Buddha's talking about real-life suffering and real-life freedom, and the Blues vernacular is perfect for this because:

1. Blues knows about mind creating reality (every blues song starts with a thought)
2. Blues understands karma (you reap what you sow, what goes around comes around)
3. Blues recognizes the difference between talking about troubles and being enslaved by them
4. Blues is about facing hard truths and finding freedom

I need to keep the Buddhist precision but make it sound like testimony from someone who's LIVED this, not just studied it.

## The Twin Verses: Blues Style

### Opening Words

These are called the Twin Verses 'cause they come in pairs, like the two sides of your life. One side shows you what happens when you get it wrong, the other shows you what happens when you get it right. The Buddha's laying out the whole deal right here at the start: your mind writes the first verse of your life's song, and everything that follows flows from that.

---

### Verses 1-2: Your Mind Writes the First Verse

**The Blues Truth:**

Listen here, baby—  
Everything starts upstairs in your head.  
Your mind's the boss of this whole operation,  
The director of your movie,  
The one writing the first line of every song you sing.

You wake up with poison in your thinking,  
Spite and greed running your show,  
Then open your mouth or make your move—  
Misery gonna follow you like a bloodhound.  
Like the wheel rolling behind that old ox pulling the cart,  
Ain't no way to shake it.  
You created it, now it's tracking you down.

But you wake up with clear water in your mind,  
Kindness and truth running your show,  
Then speak your piece or make your move—  
Joy gonna stick to you like your shadow at noon.  
Can't lose it even if you tried.  
That's just how it works.

**Blues Notes:** The Pali word *dhamma* here means everything you experience. The Buddha's saying your mental state DETERMINES how your life goes. This ain't mystical—it's testable. Try waking up bitter and see what kind of day you have. Try waking up grateful and see the difference. Your mind writes verse one. Everything else is chorus and bridge.

### Verses 3-4: Don't Keep Singing That Sad Song

**The Blues Truth:**

Now here's where it gets real—  
Somebody done you wrong.  
They lied on you, cheated you,  
Beat you down, took what's yours.  
That's the truth, that's what happened.

But now you got a choice:

You can sit up all night  
Singing that same song:  
"He abused me, he struck me,  
He beat me, he robbed me"—  
Play it over and over like a scratched record,  
Let it run through your mind on repeat.

You do that?  
The hate don't never quit.  
It's gonna grow like mold in a damp basement.  
Gonna own you more than that person who wronged you ever did.

OR—

You can know what happened,  
You can name it true,  
But you don't gotta rehearse it every day.  
You don't gotta make it your theme song.  
You can put that record back in the sleeve.

Do THAT?  
The hate dies down.  
Finds its rest.  
Leaves you free to write a new chorus.

**Blues Notes:** This ain't about being a doormat. The Buddha's not saying "let people walk all over you." He's saying: continuing to nurse your resentment is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. The event is over. The rehearsal—that's on you. That's what keeps the suffering alive.

### Verse 5: The Old, Old Law

**The Blues Truth:**

Let me tell you something about the old laws,  
The ones that were true before your grandmama was born  
And gonna be true after your great-grandkids are dust:

You can't put out fire with fire.  
You can't stop hate with hate.  
Fight poison with poison, all you get is more poison.

Only way to kill that hate  
Is to meet it with something else entirely.  
Meet it with non-hate.  
Meet it with love, or at least with letting go.  
Meet it with "I ain't carrying this no more."

That's the law.  
Old as the hills.  
You can buck against it if you want,  
But it ain't gonna change.

**Blues Notes:** *Averena*—non-hatred. Not weakness. Not "like 'em anyway." Just refusing to let hate set up shop in your heart. Gandhi knew this. King knew this. Every blues singer who found freedom instead of bitterness knew this. It's dharma, and it's also just how things work.

### Verse 6: We're All Dying Here

**The Blues Truth:**

Most folks walking around  
Don't really get it:  
We're all dying here.  
Every one of us.  
Your time, my time—  
It's running out while we stand here arguing  
About who said what and who owes who.

But the wise ones,  
The ones who've sat with death long enough  
To know it's real—  
They stop fighting about small things.

When you know you got limited time,  
When you know this whole thing ends,  
You ain't got energy to waste  
On quarrels that don't matter.

The argument ends itself  
When you remember:  
We're all perishing here.

**Blues Notes:** *Yamāmase*—we are dying, we are perishing. Memento mori. The blues knows this truth in its bones: nobody gets out alive. That knowledge either makes you bitter or makes you free. The wise let it make them free, let it show them what actually matters.

### Verses 7-8: Weak Trees and Mountains

**The Blues Truth:**

Two kinds of people in this world:

**The Weak Tree:**

You spend your days  
Chasing every pretty thing that walks by,  
Letting your eyes, your ears, your tongue  
Run wild like kids with no supervision.  
You eat too much, sleep too much,  
Can't get yourself to do the hard work.

You're like a tree with pretty leaves  
But rotten roots.  
First strong wind that comes—  
Temptation, trouble, hard times—  
You going down.  
Māra (that's death, that's delusion, that's destruction)  
Gonna knock you right over.

**The Mountain:**

But you train yourself,  
Keep your senses on a leash,  
Eat what you need and no more,  
Get up every day and do the work,  
Build that faith, build that strength—

You like a mountain.  
Storm can howl,  
Wind can blow,  
Rain can come sideways—  
You ain't moving.  
Māra ain't got nothing on you.  
You're planted too deep.

**Blues Notes:** *Asubha* meditation—contemplating the unattractive reality under the pretty surface. This ain't about hating life; it's about seeing clearly so you don't get knocked over by the first wind that blows. Sense restraint (*indriyesu susaṁvutaṁ*) isn't Puritanism; it's knowing how to drive without crashing.

### Verses 9-10: The Robe Don't Make the Monk

**The Blues Truth:**

You can put on the uniform,  
Wear the robe, the collar, the cross,  
Carry the good book,  
Talk the holy talk—

But if your heart's still full of the same old mess,  
If you ain't done the work to clean yourself up,  
If you got no self-control,  
No truth in you—

That robe ain't nothing but a costume.  
You playing dress-up.  
You don't deserve to wear it.

BUT—

If you've spit out all that poison,  
If you've done the hard work of getting clean,  
If your life lines up with what you claim,  
If you got real self-control and real truth in you—

Then you EARNED that robe.  
You got a right to wear it.  
Not 'cause of the cloth,  
But 'cause of who you became.

**Blues Notes:** Buddhism (and Blues) don't care about your costume. They care about your character. *Vantakasāva*—"vomited out the defilements"—is as visceral as it gets. Real spiritual work is ugly, sweaty, and INTERNAL. The outer sign means nothing without the inner transformation.

---

### Verses 11-12: Fool's Gold and Real Gold

**The Blues Truth:**

Lots of folks out here  
Chasing fool's gold,  
Thinking the shiny stuff is real,  
Thinking the real stuff ain't worth nothing.

They mistake:  
- Pleasure for happiness  
- Money for security  
- Fame for worth  
- Comfort for peace

They running after sapwood,  
The soft outside of the tree,  
Thinking it's the heartwood,  
The strong core.

They don't never find  
What they actually need.  
Too busy chasing what glitters.

BUT—

The wise  
They can tell the difference.  
They know heartwood from sapwood,  
Essence from appearance,  
What matters from what don't.

They chase the REAL stuff:  
- Freedom over pleasure  
- Wisdom over information  
- Character over reputation  
- Peace over excitement

And they FIND it.  
'Cause they looking in the right place.

**Blues Notes:** *Sāra* (essence, heartwood) versus *asāra* (non-essence, sapwood). The Buddha's asking: what are you actually chasing? What do you think is valuable? Most folks never question what they were taught to want. The wise question everything and choose what actually leads to freedom.

### Verses 13-14: Leaky Roofs and Good Roofs

**The Blues Truth:**

Your mind is like a house,  
And desire is like rain.

**The Leaky House:**

You ain't done no maintenance on your mind,  
Ain't trained it,  
Ain't developed it,  
Ain't built up no protection—

When the rain of wanting comes,  
It's gonna pour right through.  
Soak everything.  
Ruin your peace.  
Flood your whole life.

You gonna be miserable,  
Sitting there in a puddle,  
Wondering why you're wet.

**The Solid House:**

But you do the work,  
You train your mind through meditation,  
Develop it through practice,  
Build it strong through discipline—

When that same rain comes,  
It just runs off.  
Don't get inside.  
Don't disturb nothing.

You stay dry.  
You stay peaceful.  
The want comes, but it don't rule you.

**Blues Notes:** *Bhāvanā*—mental development, cultivation. This is Buddhism's core technology. You wouldn't leave your actual house with holes in the roof. Why leave your mind unprotected? The work of meditation and ethical training isn't optional decoration—it's the roof that keeps you dry.

### Verses 15-16: Now and Later

**The Blues Truth:**

Two roads, two destinations.

**The Sorrow Road:**

You do wrong—  
Harm folks, lie, steal, destroy—

You hurt RIGHT NOW.  
Conscience eating at you,  
Shame following you around,  
Can't look yourself in the mirror.

And you hurt LATER.  
When the consequences roll around  
(And they always do),  
You hurt even worse.

You look at what you did—  
See that stain on your own hands—  
And you grieve both places:  
Here and hereafter.

**The Joy Road:**

But you do right—  
Help folks, tell truth, build up, protect—

You FEEL GOOD right now.  
That clean-conscience peace,  
That "I did right" satisfaction,  
Looking yourself in the mirror with no shame.

And you feel BETTER later.  
When the good you did comes back around,  
When you see your deeds were clean,  
You rejoice even more.

Joy here,  
Greater joy there.

**Blues Notes:** Karma ain't punishment from above—it's the natural psychological consequence of your actions. Do harm, carry the weight of it. Do good, carry the lightness of it. Both immediate and long-term. The Buddha's being ruthlessly empirical: you can test this TODAY.

---

### Verses 17-18: Burning and Bliss

**The Blues Truth:**

This is verses 15-16, but INTENSIFIED.

**The Burning:**

You do evil,  
You BURN right now.  
"I did that terrible thing"—  
That thought alone scorches you.

Then later,  
When you end up in the bad places  
(Whatever hell looks like for you—  
Addiction, prison, isolation, regret),  
You burn HOTTER.

The fire don't quit,  
It GROWS.

**The Bliss:**

You do good,  
You REJOICE right now.  
"I did that beautiful thing"—  
That thought alone lifts you up.

Then later,  
When you end up in the good places  
(Whatever heaven looks like for you—  
Peace, community, freedom, love),  
You rejoice EVEN MORE.

The joy don't quit,  
It MULTIPLIES.

**Blues Notes:** *Tappati* (burn) versus *nandati* (rejoice). The progression from sorrow/joy to burning/bliss shows how karma COMPOUNDS. The initial consequence grows. This is either the best news or the worst news you've ever heard, depending on what you've been doing.

### Verses 19-20: Talking Ain't Walking

**The Blues Truth:**

**The Scholar Who Don't Walk:**

You can memorize every holy book,  
Quote scripture all day long,  
Sound real smart,  
Impress folks at parties—

But if you ain't DOING it,  
If you ain't living what you're reading,  
You like a cowherd  
Counting somebody else's cows.

They ain't YOUR cows.  
That ain't YOUR wisdom.  
You got no share in the real wealth.

All you got is information  
About somebody else's transformation.

**The Practitioner Who Walks:**

But say you only know a LITTLE bit—  
Maybe just one teaching,  
Maybe just the basics—

But you LIVE it.  
You actually give up your greed,  
You actually let go of your hate,  
You actually see through your delusions.

You practice what you know,  
You walk what you talk,  
You get FREE in your mind,  
You stop clinging to anything—

THAT'S the spiritual life.  
THAT'S having a share in the wealth.  
Not what you memorized,  
But what you BECAME.

**Blues Notes:** *Sāmaññassa bhāgavā*—"having a share in the spiritual life." The Buddha's final word in chapter one: transformation beats information. Liberation beats erudition. One person walking beats a hundred people talking. This is Buddhism's central claim: it's a PATH, not a philosophy. You gotta walk it.

## End of Chapter 1: The Twin Verses

**What We Learned:**

These twenty verses lay out the whole program:
1. Mind runs the show
2. Karma is cause and effect, not divine punishment  
3. Dwelling on grievances keeps you in hell
4. Only non-hate stops hate
5. Remember death—it clarifies everything
6. Train your mind or suffer the consequences
7. Real worth is internal, not external
8. Know what actually matters (not what glitters)
9. Build a strong mind to weather life's storms
10. Practice beats theory every single time

The Buddha gave us the map in pairs—wrong way, right way—so we can see the choice clearly. Now the work is ours.

The Blues has been teaching this all along. Now you got the Buddhist version too.

---

**Blues Notes on Translation Method:**

I kept Dr. Patel's doctrinal precision but translated it into the language of lived experience. Every metaphor, every image, every teaching—I put it in terms that speak to someone facing real struggle, real temptation, real life.

Buddhism says: your mind creates your world, karma is real, liberation is possible, practice is everything.

Blues says: what you think determines what you get, you reap what you sow, freedom is the goal, you gotta walk it out.

Same dharma. Different voice. Both true.
