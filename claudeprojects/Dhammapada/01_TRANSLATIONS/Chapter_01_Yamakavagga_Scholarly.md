# Chapter 1: Yamakavagga (The Twin Verses)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Yamakavagga

The opening chapter of the Dhammapada presents ten pairs of "twin verses" (*yamaka*)—contrasting teachings that illuminate the path of wisdom through comparison with its opposite. These verses establish the foundational Buddhist understanding of mind, karma, and ethical causation. The chapter's structure is pedagogically brilliant: by juxtaposing wholesome and unwholesome mental states and their consequences, the Buddha makes the mechanics of karma immediately comprehensible.

The chapter begins with perhaps the most famous verse in Buddhist literature, asserting the primacy of mind (*mano*) in shaping human experience—a teaching that anticipates modern cognitive psychology while grounding Buddhist ethics in phenomenological observation.

### Verses 1-2: Mind as the Forerunner

**Verse 1**

All phenomena are preceded by mind, led by mind, created by mind.  
If one speaks or acts with a corrupted mind,  
Suffering follows them  
As the wheel follows the foot of the ox that draws the cart.[1]

**Verse 2**

All phenomena are preceded by mind, led by mind, created by mind.  
If one speaks or acts with a pure mind,  
Happiness follows them  
Like a shadow that never departs.[2]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Mind as Primary**: The Pali *manopubbaṅgamā dhammā* asserts that *dhamma* (phenomena, experiences, mental states) are "mind-preceded." This is not metaphysical idealism but phenomenological insight: all human experience is mediated through consciousness; our mental orientation determines how we engage with reality. The image of the ox-cart wheel following the ox's hoof illustrates the inexorable nature of karmic causation—suffering (*dukkha*) follows unwholesome action as automatically as the wheel follows the draft animal.

[2] **Purity and Happiness**: The word *pasanna* (pure, clear, radiant) describes not moral perfection but clarity of mind—consciousness free from the distortions of greed, hatred, and delusion. The shadow metaphor is particularly apt: just as a shadow is inseparable from its object in sunlight, happiness (*sukha*) naturally accompanies a clear, wholesome mind. Note the progression: mind → speech/action → inevitable consequence. This establishes the Buddhist understanding of karma as psychological causation, not cosmic bookkeeping.

### Verses 3-4: Hatred and Its Cessation

**Verse 3**

"He abused me, he struck me,  
He defeated me, he robbed me"—  
For those who dwell on such thoughts,  
Hatred is never appeased.[3]

**Verse 4**

"He abused me, he struck me,  
He defeated me, he robbed me"—  
For those who do not dwell on such thoughts,  
Hatred is thoroughly appeased.[4]

#### Footnotes

[3] **The Dwelling Mind**: The verb *upanayhanti* means to harbor, dwell upon, or nurse a grievance. The verse identifies the crucial difference between experiencing harm and perpetuating hatred: not the injury itself, but the mental rehearsal of injury (*"he abused me"*) that keeps resentment alive. This anticipates modern trauma psychology's understanding of how rumination extends suffering beyond the original event.

[4] **Non-Dwelling**: The identical litany of wrongs appears in both verses, but the response differs. *Na upanayhanti*—not dwelling on, not rehearsing—creates the condition for hatred's cessation (*upasammati*, "is thoroughly appeased" or "comes to rest"). The teaching is radical: peace depends not on receiving justice or revenge, but on releasing mental fixation on the injury. This is not passive acceptance but active mental training.

### Verse 5: The Ancient Law

**Verse 5**

For never in this world is hatred appeased by hatred;  
Hatred is appeased by non-hatred (*averena*) alone—  
This is the ancient, eternal law (*sanantano*).[5]

#### Footnotes

[5] **Eternal Dharma**: This verse, one of the most frequently quoted in Buddhist literature, articulates a principle the text calls *dhammo sanantano*—"the ancient, eternal law" or "timeless truth." The Pali *avera* (non-hatred, non-enmity) is not mere passivity but active cultivation of goodwill. The verse makes an empirical claim that can be tested in experience: cycles of retaliation never produce peace; only meeting hatred with non-hatred breaks the cycle. This teaching profoundly influenced figures from Gandhi to Martin Luther King Jr., though the Buddha's concern is primarily soteriological (liberation-focused) rather than political.

### Verse 6: Awareness of Mortality

**Verse 6**

Others do not understand that we are perishing here;  
But those who understand this—  
For them, quarrels cease.[6]

#### Footnotes

[6] **"We Are Perishing"**: The phrase *mayam ettha yamāmase* ("we are perishing/dying here") carries double meaning: (1) we are all mortal, facing death; (2) we are perishing/being destroyed by our conflicts. The word *pare* ("others," the unwise) don't grasp either truth. But *medhagā* (the wise, the discerning) who comprehend mortality and conflict's futility naturally abandon quarreling (*medhagā*). Buddhist meditation on death (*maraṇassati*) is not morbid but clarifying—awareness of life's brevity makes petty disputes absurd.

### Verses 7-8: Strength and Māra

**Verse 7**

One who dwells contemplating the beautiful (*subha*),  
With senses unrestrained,  
Immoderate in eating,  
Lazy, lacking energy—  
Māra overpowers them  
As wind overpowers a weak tree.[7]

**Verse 8**

One who dwells contemplating the unbeautiful (*asubha*),  
With senses well-restrained,  
Moderate in eating,  
Faithful, energetic—  
Māra cannot overpower them,  
As wind cannot overpower a mountain.[8]

#### Footnotes

[7] **Subha and Vulnerability**: *Subhānupassin* means "contemplating the beautiful/pleasant"—here, obsessive attraction to sensory pleasures. Combined with unrestrained senses (*indriyesu asaṁvutaṁ*), lack of moderation in food, and laziness (*kusīta*), this creates maximum vulnerability to *Māra* (death, the personification of unwholesome forces). The simile of wind and weak tree (*rukkhaṁ va dubbalaṁ*) emphasizes how addiction to pleasure weakens one's spiritual resilience.

[8] **Asubha and Strength**: *Asubhānupassin* traditionally refers to meditation on the body's unattractiveness—contemplating decay, impermanence, the constructed nature of beauty. This is not self-hatred but seeing clearly (*yathābhūta ñāṇa*). Combined with sense restraint (*susaṁvutaṁ*), moderation, faith (*saddhā*), and aroused energy (*āraddhavīriyaṁ*), one becomes as immovable as a mountain (*pabbata*). These verses outline early Buddhism's program of mental training: sense restraint, moderate living, contemplative insight, ethical effort.

### Verses 9-10: The Unfit and Fit for the Robe

**Verse 9**

One who is not free from defilements (*anikkasāva*)  
Yet wears the ochre robe (*kāsāvaṁ*),  
Lacking in self-control and truthfulness—  
Such a one is not worthy of the robe.[9]

**Verse 10**

But one who has expelled all defilements,  
Well-established in moral conduct,  
Possessed of self-control and truthfulness—  
Such a one is truly worthy of the robe.[10]

#### Footnotes

[9] **The Robe and Character**: *Kāsāva* is the ochre/saffron robe of Buddhist monastics. The verse warns against hypocrisy: wearing the outer sign of renunciation while lacking the inner transformation. *Anikkasāva* means "not free from intoxicants/defilements"—the heart still stained (*kasāva*) by greed, hatred, delusion. *Dama* (self-control, taming) and *sacca* (truthfulness, integrity) are prerequisites; without them, the robe is mere costume.

[10] **True Worthiness**: *Vantakasāva* means "one who has vomited out the defilements"—a visceral image of complete rejection of unwholesome states. *Sīlesu susamāhito* indicates firm establishment in ethical conduct (*sīla*). The verse establishes an early Buddhist principle: spiritual status depends on inner transformation, not outer signs. This teaching would later inform critiques of mere ritualism in favor of genuine practice.

### Verses 11-12: Essence and Non-Essence

**Verse 11**

Those who mistake the non-essential for the essential,  
And the essential for the non-essential—  
They do not reach the essential,  
Their thoughts moving in the wrong pasture.[11]

**Verse 12**

But having known the essential as essential,  
And the non-essential as non-essential,  
They reach the essential,  
Their thoughts moving in the right pasture.[12]

#### Footnotes

[11] **Sāra/Asāra**: *Sāra* means essence, core, heartwood; *asāra* is non-essence, hollow, sapwood. The metaphor comes from tree-felling: sapwood (*asāra*) looks substantial but has no strength; heartwood (*sāra*) is the valuable core. Those who mistake pleasure for happiness, wealth for security, reputation for worth—who chase *asāra* thinking it is *sāra*—cannot reach what truly matters. *Micchāsaṅkappa* (wrong intention/thought) leads to the wrong "pasture" (*gocara*)—feeding on what doesn't nourish.

[12] **Right Discernment**: The wise (*sammāsaṅkappagocarā*) distinguish true value from false. In Buddhist context, *sāra* often refers to liberation (*nibbāna*), wisdom (*paññā*), and virtue (*sīla*)—what truly conduces to well-being. The verse emphasizes *ñatvā* (having known)—this isn't blind faith but experiential discrimination. Buddhist practice trains this discernment: learning to recognize what actually produces suffering and what produces freedom.

### Verses 13-14: The Poorly and Well-Thatched Roof

**Verse 13**

Just as rain penetrates a poorly thatched house,  
So passion penetrates an undeveloped mind.[13]

**Verse 14**

Just as rain does not penetrate a well-thatched house,  
So passion does not penetrate a well-developed mind.[14]

#### Footnotes

[13] **The Undeveloped Mind**: *Abhāvita citta* is the "un-cultured" or "undeveloped" mind—consciousness that hasn't been trained through meditation, ethical practice, and wisdom cultivation. Like a house with poor thatching (*ducchannaṁ*), it offers no protection when the rains (*vuṭṭhī*) of *rāga* (passion, lust, attachment) come. The metaphor is domestic and accessible: everyone knows a leaky roof means a miserable night. So too an untrained mind means suffering when desire strikes.

[14] **The Well-Developed Mind**: *Subhāvita citta* is the mind thoroughly cultivated (*bhāvita*) through Buddhist meditation practices—mindfulness (*sati*), concentration (*samādhi*), insight (*vipassanā*). Like a well-thatched roof (*succhannaṁ*), it protects consciousness from being flooded by passion. This is not suppression but training: desire may arise, but it doesn't "penetrate" (*samativijjhati*)—doesn't overwhelm, doesn't compel action, doesn't produce suffering. Mental development (*bhāvanā*) is Buddhism's core technology.

### Verses 15-16: Sorrow and Joy (Here and Hereafter)

**Verse 15**

Here they sorrow, hereafter they sorrow;  
The evildoer sorrows in both worlds.  
They sorrow, they are afflicted,  
Seeing the stain of their own deeds.[15]

**Verse 16**

Here they rejoice, hereafter they rejoice;  
The merit-maker rejoices in both worlds.  
They rejoice, they are overjoyed,  
Seeing the purity of their own deeds.[16]

#### Footnotes

[15] **Immediate and Future Consequences**: The structure *idha...pecca* ("here...hereafter") indicates both present and future consequences. *Pāpakārī* (the evildoer) experiences *soka* (sorrow, grief) in this life—the immediate psychological consequence of harmful action—and again after death. *Vihaññati* means "is tormented" or "afflicted." The phrase *kammakiliṭṭham attano* ("the stain/defilement of one's own deeds") emphasizes personal responsibility: we see clearly that we ourselves created this suffering through unwholesome action.

[16] **The Fruit of Merit**: *Katapuñña* (the merit-maker, one who has done wholesome deeds) experiences *modati* (joy, gladness) and *pamodati* (great joy, delight) both now and hereafter. *Kammavisuddhiṁ attano* ("the purity of one's own deeds") is the opposite of verse 15's stain—the clear conscience and well-being that naturally follow ethical action. These verses articulate karma as psychological law: wholesome action produces joy not through external reward but through its intrinsic effects on consciousness.

### Verses 17-18: Burning and Bliss (Here and Hereafter)

**Verse 17**

Here they burn, hereafter they burn;  
The evildoer burns in both worlds.  
"I have done evil"—with this they burn,  
And burn even more having gone to a bad destination.[17]

**Verse 18**

Here they rejoice, hereafter they rejoice;  
The merit-maker rejoices in both worlds.  
"I have done good"—with this they rejoice,  
And rejoice even more having gone to a good destination.[18]

#### Footnotes

[17] **Tappati—Burning**: *Tappati* means "to burn," "to be tormented," "to suffer intensely"—both from conscience (*"pāpaṁ me kataṁ"* = "Evil has been done by me") and from actual consequences (*duggatiṁ gato* = "gone to a bad destination"). The progression is ruthless: immediate psychological burning from guilt/shame, then intensified burning (*bhiyyo tappati*, "burns even more") in *duggati* (unfortunate rebirth). Whether understood literally (hell realms) or metaphorically (psychological states), the teaching is clear: harmful action creates compounding suffering.

[18] **Nandati—Rejoicing**: *Nandati* means "to rejoice," "to delight." The merit-maker experiences joy from the thought *"puññaṁ me kataṁ"* ("Good has been done by me")—not pride but the natural gladness of integrity—and even greater joy (*bhiyyo nandati*) in *suggati* (fortunate destination, happy rebirth). These verses (17-18) closely parallel 15-16 but emphasize the intensification of karmic results: temporary sorrow/joy here expands into profound burning/bliss hereafter.

### Verses 19-20: Recitation and True Practice

**Verse 19**

Though one may recite many sacred texts,  
If heedless and not practicing accordingly,  
Like a cowherd counting others' cattle,  
One has no share in the spiritual life.[19]

**Verse 20**

Though one may recite only a little of the texts,  
If one practices in accordance with the Dhamma,  
Having abandoned greed, hatred, and delusion,  
With rightly-knowing mind, well-liberated,  
Clinging to nothing here or hereafter—  
Such a one has a share in the spiritual life.[20]

#### Footnotes

[19] **Recitation Without Practice**: *Sahitaṁ* refers to sacred texts, the collected teachings. *Nara pamatto* is "a heedless person" who doesn't practice (*na takkaro*, "not a doer"). The simile is cutting: like a *gopa* (cowherd) who counts (*gaṇayaṁ*) cattle belonging to others (*paresaṁ*), the mere scholar has no ownership of wisdom. *Sāmaññassa* means "the spiritual/monastic life"—here, authentic spiritual attainment. Memorization without transformation is worthless; scholarship without practice is counting others' wealth.

[20] **Little Recitation, Much Practice**: Even minimal textual knowledge (*appam-pi ce sahitaṁ*) suffices if one is *anudhammacārī* (practicing in accordance with Dhamma). The verse then lists what constitutes true practice: abandoning (*pahāya*) the three roots of unwholesome action—*rāga* (greed/lust), *dosa* (hatred/aversion), *moha* (delusion/ignorance); possessing *sammappajāna* (right knowledge, clear comprehension); having *suvimuttacitto* (well-liberated mind); and being *anupādiyāna* (not clinging) to anything in this world or the next. This is the essence of Buddhism: not erudition but transformation, not belief but liberation. *Sa bhāgavā* ("such a one has a share")—this person genuinely participates in the fruits of the spiritual path.

### Key Concepts

1. **Yamaka (Twin Verses)**: The pedagogical method of presenting contrasting pairs to illuminate truth through comparison
2. **Manopubbaṅgama**: Mind-precedence—the primacy of mental orientation in shaping experience
3. **Karma as Psychological Causation**: Actions produce consequences through their effects on consciousness, not cosmic mechanism
4. **Sāra/Asāra**: The crucial discernment between essential and non-essential values
5. **Bhāvanā**: Mental development/cultivation through systematic meditative practice

### Cross-References

- **Lotus Sutra**: Similar emphasis on expedient means and the primacy of mind
- **Yogacara Buddhism**: "Mind-only" (*cittamātra*) philosophy elaborates the mind-primacy of verses 1-2
- **Tibetan Lojong**: Mind-training practices develop the mental strength described in verses 7-8
- **Theravada Abhidhamma**: Systematic analysis of mental factors (*cetasika*) underlying karma

### Historical Context

The Dhammapada likely reached its current form around the 3rd century BCE, though the verses themselves may preserve material from the Buddha's lifetime (circa 5th century BCE). It became one of the most widely translated Buddhist texts, with versions in Chinese, Tibetan, and numerous modern languages.
