# Chapter 9: Evil

Evil. Not some demon out there—it's what we DO that harms. And it accumulates. Drop by drop, the pot fills. Bit by bit, the karma builds. You can't outrun it. Can't hide in the sky, the sea, the mountain cave. This chapter tells it straight: hasten toward good, flee from evil, and know that every little thing counts.

## Verses 116, 117, and 118: Hurry Toward Good

The Buddha said:

"Hasten to do wholesome deeds; ward the mind from wickedness. For the mind slow in meriting delights in wickedness.

Should someone do an evil deed, they should not do it again and again. Let them not set their intention there—suffering accumulates for the wicked.

Should someone do a good deed, they should do it again and again. Let them set their intention there—joy accumulates for one who makes merit."

And here's the Blues truth: Hurry toward the good. Keep the mind from wickedness. Slow to make merit? The mind slides toward the mess.

Do evil once? Don't do it again. Don't set your heart there—suffering piles up in the end.

Do good once? DO it again. Set your heart there—joy piles up. Repetition builds momentum. Where you set your intention matters.

## Verses 119 and 120: It Ripens When It Ripens

The Buddha said:

"Even the wicked one experiences good fortune while the wickedness does not ripen; but when the wickedness ripens, the wicked one experiences wicked results.

Even the fortunate one experiences misfortune while the good fortune does not ripen; but when the good fortune ripens, the fortunate one experiences good results."

And here's the Blues truth: The wicked may prosper while the evil hasn't ripened yet. But when that evil ripens, the wicked gets what the wicked gets.

The good may suffer while the good hasn't come through. But when the good fortune ripens, the good gets what's due.

Don't judge by today. Karma ripens on its own time. Current experience doesn't always match current deeds because of the time lag. But ripening is certain.

## Verses 121 and 122: Drop by Drop

The Buddha said:

"Do not dismiss wickedness thinking, 'It will not come to me.' Through the falling of water drops the water pot is filled. The fool, gathering bit by bit, becomes full of wickedness.

Do not dismiss merit thinking, 'It will not come to me.' Through the falling of water drops the water pot is filled. The wise one, gathering bit by bit, becomes full of merit."

And here's the Blues truth: Don't dismiss evil thinking, "Won't touch me." Drop by drop, the water pot gets full. The fool gathers bit by bit, becomes full of wrong.

Don't dismiss merit thinking, "Won't reach me." Drop by drop, the water pot gets full. The wise one gathers bit by bit, becomes full of right.

Little drops fill the pot. Every deed counts—whether you think so or not. Each drop seems nothing; together they fill the vessel. Never dismiss any action as too small to matter.

## Verses 123 and 124: Avoid the Poison

The Buddha said:

"Like a merchant on a dangerous road, with few companions and great wealth, like one loving life avoiding poison—so should one avoid wicked deeds.

If there is no wound in the hand, one can carry poison in the palm. Poison does not enter without a wound; no evil results for one who does no wrong."

And here's the Blues truth: Like a merchant on a dangerous road, few friends, heavy load—like someone who loves living avoids the deadly sting—avoid evil like poison in your drink.

But here's the subtle teaching: If no wound is in your hand, you can carry poison all day. Poison can't enter without a wound. If there's no opening for evil—no evil deed done—no bad result can enter. Evil can't hurt the one who lives the right way.

## Verse 125: Dust Against the Wind

The Buddha said:

"One who offends against an inoffensive person, a purified, passionless one—that wicked deed returns to the fool like fine dust thrown against the wind."

And here's the Blues truth: Attack someone pure, someone harmless, someone with no passion inside—that evil comes right back to you like dust thrown against the tide.

Throw dust against the wind—it blows right back in your face. Harm the harmless, hurt the pure—it returns to its starting place. The harm returns to the attacker.

---

## Verse 126: Where Do You End Up?

The Buddha said:

"Some are reborn in the womb; evildoers go to the underworld; the righteous go to heaven; those without pollutants attain complete liberation."

And here's the Blues truth: Four roads, depending how you live.

Some come back as humans, born again in a womb. Evildoers go down to the underworld's doom. The righteous rise to heaven. Those with no pollution left? They're free. They don't re-die—complete liberation.

You choose which road you take.

## Verses 127 and 128: Nowhere to Hide

The Buddha said:

"Neither in the sky, nor in mid-ocean, nor entering a mountain cave—there is no place on earth where one can escape wicked deeds.

Neither in the sky, nor in mid-ocean, nor entering a mountain cave—there is no place on earth where death will not overcome one."

And here's the Blues truth: Not in the sky. Not in the deep blue sea. Not in a mountain cave. There's nowhere you can flee.

No place on earth where you escape what you've done. Karma finds everyone.

No place on earth where death won't track you down. The universe has no hiding places.

## End of Chapter 9

What we learned in these thirteen verses comes down to accumulation and inevitability. Hurry toward good, flee from evil. Don't repeat wickedness—suffering piles up. Repeat merit—joy piles up. Evil ripens in its own time; don't be fooled by temporary luck. Good ripens too; don't despair during hard times. Drop by drop fills the pot—every deed counts. Avoid evil like poison. Without the wound, poison can't enter. Harm the pure and it blows back in your face. Four destinations: human, hell, heaven, or freedom. Nowhere in sky, sea, or mountain can you hide from consequences. Death finds everyone, everywhere.

Drop by drop. Bit by bit. Every little deed counts. That's the truth of it.
