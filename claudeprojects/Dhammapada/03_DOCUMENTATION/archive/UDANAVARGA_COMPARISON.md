# Udānavarga Nirvāṇavarga: Comparative Analysis

## Overview

The **Udānavarga** (Sanskrit Buddhist text, Sarvāstivāda tradition) contains a dedicated **Nirvāṇavarga** as Chapter 26. This document compares those verses with the Pali Dhammapada material hypothesized to have once formed a separate Nibbānavagga.

### Verse Content

| Verse | Sanskrit | Translation | Pali Dhammapada Parallel |
|-------|----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| 26.1 | *kūrmo yathāṅgāni...* | Like a tortoise withdrawing limbs into its shell, one rests in the Self's reflections, dependent on no other, harming no one, fully cooled, one should disparage no one. | **No direct parallel** |
| 26.2 | *kṣāntiḥ paramaṁ tapas titīkṣā nirvāṇaṁ paramaṁ vadanti buddhāḥ...* | "Patience and endurance are the highest austerity; **the Buddhas call Nirvana the highest**. For one is not a renunciate who harms another, nor an ascetic who oppresses others." | **Dhp 184** (partial) |
| 26.3 | *mā kaṁcit paruṣaṁ brūthaḥ...* | Speak not harshly to anyone; those addressed will respond in kind. Painful indeed is contentious speech, and retaliation may overtake you. | **Dhp 133** (partial) |
| 26.4 | *yad īrayasi hātmānaṁ...* | If you shake yourself like a broken gong, you will long experience the round of birth and death. | **No direct parallel** |

## Comparison: Udānavarga vs. Pali Dhammapada

### Shared Nibbana Verses

| Theme | Udānavarga | Pali Dhammapada |
|-------|------------|-----------------|
| "Nirvana is the highest happiness" | 26.6 | Dhp 204 |
| "Nirvana is the highest (after suffering)" | 26.7 | Dhp 203 |
| "Bail out the boat → reach Nirvana" | 26.12 | Dhp 369 |
| "Course of Arahants is Nirvana" | 26.10 | Dhp 92 (partial) |
| "Patience is the highest austerity" | 26.2 | Dhp 184 |

### Unique to Udānavarga Nirvāṇavarga

| Verse | Content | Significance |
|-------|---------|--------------|
| 26.1 | Tortoise simile—withdrawing limbs | Unique contemplative image |
| 26.4-5 | Gong simile—agitation vs. stillness | Original teaching on mental calm |
| 26.8-9 | Causal analysis of destinations | Abhidharmic analysis |
| 26.13 | "It was, then it was not..." | Proto-Madhyamaka emptiness |

### Key Observation

The Udānavarga Nirvāṇavarga contains verses that are **scattered throughout the Pali Dhammapada** rather than collected in a single chapter:
- Dhp 203-204 are in **Sukhavagga** (Chapter 15: Happiness)
- Dhp 369 is in **Bhikkhuvagga** (Chapter 25: The Monk)
- Dhp 92 is in **Arahantavagga** (Chapter 7: Arahants)
- Dhp 184 is in **Buddhavagga** (Chapter 14: The Buddha)

This suggests that the Pali tradition **dispersed** Nibbana-focused verses across multiple chapters, rather than collecting them as the Udānavarga did.

## Comparison: Udānavarga Nirvāṇavarga vs. Proposed Pali Nibbānavagga

### Thematic Alignment

| Theme | Udānavarga 26 | Proposed Pali Ch. 27 |
|-------|---------------|----------------------|
| Nirvana as highest goal | ✅ 26.6, 26.7 | ✅ 27.1 (know the Unconditioned) |
| Transcending both shores | ❌ | ✅ 27.3 (neither shore exists) |
| Immersion in Deathless | ❌ | ✅ 27.5 (reached immersion in Deathless) |
| Beyond merit and demerit | ❌ | ✅ 27.6 (transcended merit and demerit) |
| Extinguished/cooled | ✅ 26.1 (fully cooled) | ✅ 27.8, 27.12 (extinguished, cooled) |
| Arahant attainment | ✅ 26.10 (course of Arahants) | ✅ 27.14, 27.17 (Arahant, destruction of birth) |
| Nothing in three times | ❌ | ✅ 27.15 (nothing in past, future, present) |
| Patience/endurance | ✅ 26.2 | ❌ (in proposed Ch. 28) |
| Non-harm | ✅ 26.2, 26.3 | ❌ (in proposed Ch. 28) |

### Conclusion

The proposed Pali **Nibbānavagga** (extracted from Ch. 26) shares significant thematic overlap with the Udānavarga **Nirvāṇavarga**:
- Both describe Nibbana as the ultimate goal
- Both emphasize the "cooled" or "extinguished" state
- Both culminate in Arahant attainment

However, the proposed Pali Nibbānavagga is more focused on the **state of liberation** (transcendence, beyond shores, destruction of birth), while the Udānavarga Nirvāṇavarga includes more **practical advice** (patience, non-harm, bailing out the boat).

This suggests that while both traditions had Nibbana-focused collections, they organized the material differently—with the Pali tradition eventually **merging** its Nibbānavagga into the Brāhmaṇavagga.

## Validation Summary

| Evidence | Finding | Validation |
|----------|---------|------------|
| Udānavarga has dedicated Nirvāṇavarga | ✅ Chapter 26, 13+ verses | **Confirmed** |
| Pali Dhammapada lacks dedicated Nibbana chapter | ✅ Nibbana verses scattered | **Confirmed** |
| Udānavarga Nirvāṇavarga overlaps with Pali | ✅ 5+ shared verses | **Confirmed** |
| Proposed Pali Nibbānavagga themes match | ✅ Strong thematic alignment | **Confirmed** |
| Different traditions organized Nibbana material | ✅ Sarvāstivāda kept separate | **Confirmed** |
| Pali tradition may have merged chapters | ✅ Consistent with hypothesis | **Supported** |

---

## Conclusion

The existence of a dedicated **Nirvāṇavarga** in the Udānavarga strongly supports the hypothesis that the Pali Dhammapada once had (or should have had) a similar chapter. The thematic alignment between the proposed Pali Nibbānavagga (verses 383-386 and 411-423) and the Udānavarga Nirvāṇavarga provides independent validation for the 28-chapter reconstruction.
