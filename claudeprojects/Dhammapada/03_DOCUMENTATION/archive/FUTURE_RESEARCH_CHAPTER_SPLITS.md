# Future Research: Additional Dhammapada Chapter Splits

## Chapter 24 (Taṇhāvagga) Investigation

**Date:** December 10, 2025
**Status:** Investigated, not pursued in current article

### Summary

Chapter 24 was analyzed as a potential split candidate after the Chapter 26/14 splits.

### Statistics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Verses | 26 |
| σ from mean | +1.43 |
| Rank | 2nd longest after Ch.26 |

### Potential Seam Identified

**Location:** Between verses 350 and 351

- **Before (334-350):** General teaching on craving—metaphors, suffering, remedy
- **After (351-353):** Buddha's autobiographical declaration after awakening

Verse 353:
> "All-Conquering, All-Wise am I... liberated through craving's destruction. Having known directly myself—whom should I point to as Teacher?"

This sounds like it could belong in Buddhavagga (The Buddha), not Taṇhāvagga (Craving).

### Why Not Pursued

1. **Thematic seam less pronounced** than in Chapter 26
2. **Extractable material too brief** (only 3 verses: 351-353)
3. **Would not form coherent chapter** on its own

### Udānavarga Parallel

Partial. Udānavarga has related separate chapters but mapping is less clear than Nirvāṇavarga/Tathāgatavarga.

### Recommendation

Remains a candidate for future research. Could be mentioned if peer reviewers ask why other chapters weren't considered.
