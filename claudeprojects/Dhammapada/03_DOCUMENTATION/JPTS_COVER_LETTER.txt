Subject: Manuscript Submission – 'The Missing Nibbānavagga: Evidence for a 28-Chapter Dhammapada'

Dear Editors,

I am pleased to submit the attached manuscript, 'The Missing Nibbānavagga: Evidence for a 28-Chapter Dhammapada', for consideration in the Journal of the Pali Text Society.

This article presents original research proposing that the Pali Dhammapada originally contained twenty-eight chapters before two chapters—a Nibbānavagga (on liberation) and a Tathāgatavagga (on the Buddha's teaching)—were merged into adjacent chapters during oral transmission.

The evidence includes:

1. Structural anomaly: Chapter 26 (Brāhmaṇavagga) contains forty-one verses—2.5 times the average chapter length—representing a statistical outlier of 3.6 standard deviations from the mean.

2. Thematic seams: Verse-by-verse analysis reveals two clear breaks in the Brāhmaṇavagga where Nibbāna-focused material (verses 383–386 and 411–423) appears joined to brahmin-definition content.

3. Comparative support: The Sanskrit Udānavarga preserves both a Nirvāṇavarga and Tathāgatavarga as distinct chapters, suggesting these were recognized thematic categories in early Buddhist verse collections.

4. Precedent: The Lotus Sutra's Chapter 12 (Devadatta) was similarly embedded in Chapter 11 in earlier recensions, demonstrating that chapter merging occurred in Buddhist textual transmission.

The manuscript contributes to the understudied dimension of chapter formation in Buddhist oral tradition and invites reconsideration of how the Dhammapada achieved its canonical structure. I believe this article falls within the JPTS's scope of interest in 'the history of Pali literature, textual transmission, manuscripts, and the Pali language' and 'the relationship of Pali texts to those in other languages'.

The manuscript is approximately 2,500 words and has not been submitted elsewhere. I confirm that this is original work and that I am the sole author.

Thank you for considering this submission. I look forward to your response.

Respectfully submitted,
