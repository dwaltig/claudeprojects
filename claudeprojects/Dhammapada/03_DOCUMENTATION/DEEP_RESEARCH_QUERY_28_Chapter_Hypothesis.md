**Purpose**: Find scholarly support and potential counter-arguments for the JPTS article "The Missing Nibbānavagga: Evidence for a 28-Chapter Dhammapada"
**Article Status**: Submitted to Journal of the Pali Text Society (December 10, 2025)
**Author**: William Altig
**Query Created**: 2025-12-12

## 📋 Article Thesis Summary

The article proposes that the Pali Dhammapada originally contained **28 chapters** before two chapters—a **Nibbānavagga** (on liberation) and a **Tathāgatavagga** (on the Buddha)—were merged into adjacent chapters during oral transmission. Key evidence:

1. **Structural anomaly**: Chapter 26 (Brāhmaṇavagga) contains 41 verses—2.5× average length (3.6 standard deviations)
2. **Thematic seams**: Nibbāna-focused material (vv. 383-386, 410-423) embedded in brahmin content  
3. **Comparative evidence**: Sanskrit Udānavarga preserves distinct Nirvāṇavarga and Tathāgatavarga
4. **Precedent**: Lotus Sutra Chapter 12 (Devadatta) was similarly embedded in earlier recensions

Conduct comprehensive scholarly research on Dhammapada textual criticism, chapter formation, and variant recensions to support or challenge a hypothesis about the Pali Dhammapada's original structure.

## THESIS TO INVESTIGATE:

The Pali Dhammapada may have originally contained 28 chapters. Evidence suggests that two chapters—a Nibbānavagga (on Nirvana/liberation) and possibly a Tathāgatavagga (on the Buddha's teaching)—were merged into adjacent chapters during oral transmission. Chapter 26 (Brāhmaṇavagga) at 41 verses is anomalously long (3.6 standard deviations above mean chapter length) and contains clear thematic seams.

### 6. Numerological Considerations
- Research the significance of chapter numbers in Buddhist texts
- Find any scholarship on intentional numerological structuring
- Research whether 28 has special significance in Buddhist tradition
- Find any analysis of why the Lotus Sutra has 28 chapters

### 7. Statistical/Structural Analysis
- Find any statistical analyses of Dhammapada chapter lengths
- Research methodologies for identifying textual seams or interpolations
- Find scholarship on detecting merged text sections in Buddhist literature
