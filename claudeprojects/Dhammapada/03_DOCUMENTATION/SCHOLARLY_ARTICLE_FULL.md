## Abstract

This article proposes that the Pali Dhammapada originally comprised twenty-eight chapters, not the canonical twenty-six, based on three converging lines of evidence: (1) structural anomalies in Chapter 26 (Brāhmaṇavagga), which at forty-one verses is 2.5 times the average chapter length; (2) the presence of a dedicated Nirvāṇavarga (Nirvana chapter) in the parallel Sanskrit Udānavarga tradition; and (3) precedent from Lotus Sutra textual history, where Chapter 12 (Devadatta) was similarly embedded within Chapter 11 before being separated in later recensions. Verse-by-verse thematic analysis identifies two clear 'seams' in Brāhmaṇavagga where Nibbāna-focused material (verses 383–386 and 411–423) appears merged with brahmin-definition content. Additionally, structural analysis of Chapter 14 (Buddhavagga) reveals a natural division between verses describing *who* the Buddha is (179–187) and verses describing *what* the Buddha taught (188–196), paralleling the Udānavarga's distinct Tathāgatavarga. Extracting these materials reconstructs two hypothetical chapters—Nibbānavagga and Tathāgatavagga—yielding a twenty-eight-chapter structure that aligns with the numerologically significant chapter count of the Lotus Sutra. The findings contribute to understanding chapter formation in early Buddhist oral transmission and invite reconsideration of canonical verse collection organization.

## I. Introduction

The Dhammapada stands as one of the most beloved and widely-translated texts in the Buddhist canon. Its 423 verses, organized into twenty-six chapters (*vagga*), have been memorized, chanted, and contemplated by practitioners for over two millennia. The text's enduring appeal lies in its accessibility: brief, memorable verses distilling the Buddha's core teachings on ethics, mental cultivation, and liberation. Yet beneath this apparent simplicity lies a complex textual history that scholars have only begun to unravel.

The question of how the Dhammapada acquired its present structure—why these particular verses, in this particular order, grouped into these particular chapters—remains inadequately addressed in the scholarly literature. Most studies have focused on comparing verse content across the various Dhammapada recensions (Pali, Gāndhārī, Patna, and Udānavarga) rather than examining the logic of chapter formation itself. This article addresses that gap by proposing that the Pali Dhammapada's current twenty-six-chapter structure represents a compression of an earlier twenty-eight-chapter arrangement.

### The Problem of Chapter 26

The first indication that something unusual occurred during the text's transmission is the anomalous length of Chapter 26, the Brāhmaṇavagga ('Chapter on the Brahmin'). At forty-one verses, this chapter is 2.5 times longer than the average chapter length of sixteen verses. No other chapter approaches this magnitude. The statistical deviation is striking: with a standard deviation of approximately seven verses across the twenty-six chapters, the Brāhmaṇavagga represents an outlier of more than three standard deviations from the mean.

Such anomalies invite explanation. Did the original compilers simply have more to say about the brahmin? Or does this chapter contain material that was once organized differently?

### Comparative Evidence: The Udānavarga

The Sanskrit Udānavarga, compiled by Dharmatrāta and preserved in the Sarvāstivāda tradition, offers crucial comparative evidence. This parallel collection contains approximately 1,050 verses organized into thirty-three chapters—seven more than the Pali Dhammapada. While many chapters share titles and content between the two texts, the Udānavarga contains several chapters absent from the Pali:

- Nirvāṇavarga (Chapter 26): A dedicated chapter on Nirvana
- Tathāgatavarga (Chapter 21): A chapter on the Tathāgata distinct from general Buddha teachings
- Mitravarga: A chapter on friendship
- Smṛtivarga: A chapter on mindfulness

The existence of a dedicated Nirvāṇavarga in the Udānavarga is particularly significant. Nibbāna (Pali) or Nirvāṇa (Sanskrit) represents the ultimate goal of the Buddhist path—the cessation of suffering, the unconditioned, the deathless. Yet the Pali Dhammapada contains no chapter devoted to this central concept. References to Nibbāna are instead scattered throughout various chapters, with notable concentrations in the Sukhavagga (Happiness), Buddhavagga (Buddha), and—significantly—the Brāhmaṇavagga.

### Precedent: The Lotus Sutra's Hidden Chapter

The hypothesis that Buddhist texts could contain 'hidden' or merged chapters finds precedent in the textual history of the Lotus Sutra (*Saddharmapuṇḍarīka Sūtra*). Scholars have established that Chapter 12 of the Kumārajīva Chinese translation, the Devadatta Chapter (*Devadatta-parivarta*), was originally embedded within Chapter 11 (the Treasure Tower Chapter) in earlier Sanskrit recensions.[^1] The separation occurred during the Chinese translation process, revealing that chapter divisions in Buddhist texts were fluid during transmission.

If such merging and separation occurred in the Lotus Sutra—one of Mahāyāna Buddhism's most important texts—similar phenomena may have occurred in Theravāda collections like the Dhammapada.

### The Numerological Dimension

The suggestion that textual compilers intentionally used numerologically significant structures is not mere speculation—ancient Indian and Buddhist traditions were deeply committed to sacred number symbolism. The evidence for intentional numerological design is extensive:

**Buddhist Sacred Numbers in Canonical Texts:**

- 3: Three Jewels (Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha), Three Marks of Existence
- 4: Four Noble Truths, Four Foundations of Mindfulness
- 5: Five Aggregates, Five Precepts, Five Hindrances
- 8: Noble Eightfold Path, Eight Worldly Conditions
- 12: Twelve Links of Dependent Origination
- 37: Thirty-seven Wings of Awakening (*bodhipakkhiyā dhammā*)
- 108: Number of mala beads, 108 defilements

These are not coincidental groupings but deliberate organizational frameworks. The Buddha's teaching is systematically structured around numbered lists optimized for both memorization and symbolic resonance.

**The Number Twenty-Eight Specifically:**

- Perfect Number: Twenty-eight is a perfect number (1+2+4+7+14=28), a category ancient mathematicians considered cosmologically significant.[^2]
- Lunar Cycle: The lunar month of approximately twenty-eight days governed the Buddhist *uposatha* (observance day) calendar.
- Lotus Sutra: The Lotus Sutra's twenty-eight chapters suggest this number held pan-Buddhist symbolic importance.
- Twenty-eight Buddhas: Theravāda tradition recognizes twenty-eight Buddhas from the past, suggesting the number's association with completeness.[^3]

If both the Lotus Sutra (Mahāyāna) and the Dhammapada (Theravāda) originally shared a twenty-eight-chapter structure, this would reflect deliberate design by compilers who understood—and valued—numerological symbolism.

### Scope and Method

This article proceeds as follows. Section II reviews the scholarly literature on the Dhammapada family of texts, the Udānavarga, and chapter formation in Buddhist oral tradition. Section III outlines the methodology employed. Section IV presents the findings. Section V offers a reconstructed twenty-eight-chapter Dhammapada. Section VI discusses implications, and Section VII concludes.

## II. Literature Review

### A. The Dhammapada Family of Texts

The Dhammapada exists as a family of related verse collections preserved across different Buddhist traditions. Each recension represents an independent transmission of material drawn from a common pool of teachings.

**The Pali Dhammapada.** The Pali Dhammapada, preserved in the Khuddaka Nikāya of the Theravāda canon, contains 423 verses organized into twenty-six chapters. K. R. Norman's critical edition and translation represents the standard scholarly reference.[^4]

**The Gāndhārī Dharmapada.** The Gāndhārī Dharmapada, discovered in Central Asian manuscripts, represents the oldest known Indian manuscript of any Buddhist text. John Brough's landmark edition revealed a text of approximately 540 verses in what appears to be twenty-six chapters.[^5]

**The Patna Dharmapada.** Edited by Margaret Cone, the Patna Dharmapada contains 414 verses in twenty-two chapters—four fewer than the Pali version.[^6] This reduced chapter count suggests that chapter merging occurred in this transmission lineage.

**The Udānavarga.** The Sanskrit Udānavarga, compiled by Dharmatrāta and edited by Franz Bernhard, contains approximately 1,050 verses in thirty-three chapters.[^7] W. Woodville Rockhill's early translation made the text accessible to Western scholars.[^8]

### B. Chapter Formation in Buddhist Oral Tradition

Early Buddhist texts were transmitted orally for centuries before being written down. This oral context shaped textual organization. Verses were grouped into chapters of manageable length for memorization and recitation. The average chapter length in the Pali Dhammapada (approximately sixteen verses) likely reflects cognitive constraints on memory.

The Patna Dharmapada's twenty-two chapters versus the standard twenty-six demonstrates that chapter consolidation occurred during transmission—precisely the phenomenon this article proposes occurred with the Nibbānavagga.

### C. The Udānavarga's Nirvāṇavarga

The Udānavarga's Chapter 26, the Nirvāṇavarga, provides crucial evidence. This chapter contains verses explicitly devoted to the concept and attainment of Nirvana. Representative verses include:

> *kṣāntiḥ paramaṁ tapas titīkṣā nirvāṇaṁ paramaṁ vadanti buddhāḥ*
> 'Patience and endurance are the highest austerity; the Buddhas call Nirvana the highest.'[^9]

These verses have parallels in the Pali Dhammapada, but they appear in the Sukhavagga rather than in a dedicated Nibbāna chapter.

## III. Methodology

This study employs three complementary methodological approaches: structural analysis, thematic categorization, and comparative analysis.

**Structural Analysis.** Verse counts were tabulated and analysed for statistical patterns. Chapters deviating significantly from the mean (more than two standard deviations) were flagged for closer examination.

**Thematic Categorization.** Each verse in the anomalously long chapters was classified by dominant theme. Points where thematic content shifted abruptly were identified as potential 'seams'—locations where originally separate material may have been joined.

**Comparative Analysis.** Pali verses with Udānavarga parallels were traced to determine organizational differences. Udānavarga chapters without Pali equivalents (such as the Nirvāṇavarga) were examined for thematic parallels with dispersed Pali material.

---

## IV. Findings

### A. Statistical Anomalies in Chapter Length

Analysis of verse distribution reveals significant structural imbalance:

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Total verses | 423 |
| Mean verses per chapter | 16.3 |
| Standard deviation | 6.8 |
| Brāhmaṇavagga (Ch. 26) | 41 verses |
| Deviation from mean | 3.63 σ |

The Brāhmaṇavagga's forty-one verses represent an extreme statistical outlier. In a normally distributed sample, such a value would occur by chance less than 0.03% of the time.

### B. Thematic Analysis of Brāhmaṇavagga

Verse-by-verse examination reveals distinct thematic sections:

**Section 1: Verses 383–386 — 'Liberation and the Unconditioned'.** These opening verses focus on achieving Nibbāna using transcendence language ('unconditioned', 'neither shore', 'highest goal').

**Section 2: Verses 387–410 — 'Brahmin Definition Through Conduct'.** This central section forms the thematically coherent core, consistently employing the refrain 'that one I call a brahmin' (*tamahaṁ brūmi brāhmaṇaṁ*).

**Section 3: Verses 411–423 — 'Transcendence and Final Attainment'.** The final thirteen verses shift to explicit Nibbāna terminology: 'deathless' (*amata*), 'extinguished' (*nibbuta*), 'cooled' (*sītibhūta*).

**Seam Identification.** Two clear thematic seams emerge:

*Seam 1 (between verses 386 and 387):* Shift from transcendence language to radiance/etymology.

*Seam 2 (between verses 410 and 411):* Shift from character traits ('no longings') to transcendent states ('immersion in the deathless').

### C. Thematic Analysis of Buddhavagga

A similar analysis of Chapter 14 reveals a natural division:

- Verses 179–187: Describe *who* the Buddha is (the pathless one, four rare things)
- Verses 188–196: Describe *what* the Buddha taught (Three Refuges, Four Noble Truths)

This corresponds to what the Udānavarga organizes as the distinct Tathāgatavarga.

### D. Comparison with Udānavarga

The Udānavarga's Nirvāṇavarga contains at least thirteen verses explicitly focused on Nirvana. Several have Pali parallels, but these parallels are *dispersed* across multiple Pali chapters:

| Udānavarga Verse | Pali Parallel | Pali Chapter |
|------------------|---------------|--------------|
| 26.6 | Dhp 204 | Sukhavagga (15) |
| 26.7 | Dhp 203 | Sukhavagga (15) |
| 26.12 | Dhp 369 | Bhikkhuvagga (25) |

This dispersal pattern suggests different editorial choices rather than fundamentally different source material.

## V. Reconstruction

Based on the evidence, a hypothetical twenty-eight-chapter Dhammapada can be reconstructed:

1. Split Buddhavagga (Chapter 14) into:
   - Chapter 14: Buddhavagga (verses 179–187)
   - Chapter 15: Tathāgatavagga (verses 188–196)

2. Split Brāhmaṇavagga (Chapter 26) into:
   - Chapter 27: Nibbānavagga (verses 383–386, 411–423)
   - Chapter 28: Brāhmaṇavagga (verses 387–410)

3. Renumber Chapters 15–25 to Chapters 16–26.

**Numerological Alignment.** Analysis of chapter-number correspondences in the reconstructed text reveals striking alignments:

- Chapter 27 (Nibbānavagga): 27 reduces to 9 (2+7=9), the number of completion and enlightenment—remarkably appropriate for a chapter on Nibbāna.
- Chapter 28 (Brāhmaṇavagga): 28 reduces to 1 (2+8=10, 1+0=1), the number of unity and return to source—apt for the final chapter.

## VI. Discussion

### Implications for Textual History

If the twenty-eight-chapter hypothesis is correct, it suggests that the Pali Dhammapada underwent consolidation during oral transmission. Two chapters—Tathāgatavagga and Nibbānavagga—were merged into adjacent chapters at some point before the text achieved its canonical form.

The existence of the Patna Dharmapada's twenty-two-chapter structure demonstrates that chapter consolidation occurred in at least one transmission lineage. The Pali tradition's twenty-six chapters may represent a mid-point between an original twenty-eight and the more condensed twenty-two.

### Limitations and Future Research

This study has limitations that future research should address:

1. The hypothesis is based on internal structural analysis and comparative evidence, not manuscript discovery.
2. Alternative explanations for the Brāhmaṇavagga's length should be rigorously evaluated.
3. The Pali commentaries should be examined for awareness of earlier chapter arrangements.

---

## VII. Conclusion

This article has presented evidence that the Pali Dhammapada may have originally contained twenty-eight chapters before two chapters—a Nibbānavagga and a Tathāgatavagga—were merged into adjacent chapters during oral transmission.

The evidence includes: (1) structural anomaly—the Brāhmaṇavagga's forty-one verses represent a statistical outlier of 3.6 standard deviations; (2) thematic seams—verse-by-verse analysis reveals two clear breaks within the Brāhmaṇavagga; (3) comparative support—the Udānavarga preserves both a Nirvāṇavarga and a Tathāgatavarga as distinct chapters; (4) precedent—the Lotus Sutra's textual history demonstrates that chapter embedding occurred in Buddhist literature; and (5) numerological alignment—a twenty-eight-chapter structure would align with the Lotus Sutra's chapter count and produce meaningful chapter-number correspondences.

Whether or not the twenty-eight-chapter hypothesis ultimately proves correct, this study contributes to understanding an underexamined dimension of Buddhist textual history: not just what the early Buddhists taught, but how they organized their teachings for transmission across generations.
