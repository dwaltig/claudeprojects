# ABOUT THE DHAMMAPADA

The Dhammapada, Verses of the Teaching, is one of the most beloved texts in all of Buddhism. Its 423 verses, organized into 26 chapters, were composed in Pali and transmitted orally for centuries before being written down around the 1st century BCE.

According to tradition, these verses were spoken by the Buddha himself over the course of his 45-year teaching ministry, then gathered by his disciples after his passing. At the First Buddhist Council, held shortly after the Buddha's death, his attendant Ānanda recited the discourses from memory while the assembly verified their authenticity.

For 2,500 years, these words have been memorized, chanted, and lived by practitioners seeking liberation. This interpretation carries that ancient stream into contemporary American English, using the rhythms and imagery of the Blues tradition to let the teaching land where it's meant to land: in the heart.

---

# A NOTE FROM THE INTERPRETER

You hold in your hands something ancient made new. The Dhammapada was meant to be felt, not just understood. Poetry for the heart, not prose for the intellect.

The Blues comes from a different soil, the Mississippi Delta, the juke joints, the long roads of African American experience. But it carries the same truth: suffering is real, and freedom is possible. You reap what you sow. Your mind creates your world. And the only way out is through.

This translation uses Blues rhythm and Blues language to let these verses hit where they're supposed to hit: in the gut, in the bones, in the midnight hour when you're alone with your thoughts.

Every teaching here is the Buddha's. The voice is the Blues.

May it serve your liberation.

## The Twin Verses: When the Truth Comes in Pairs

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

## The Professor's Translation Review

**What the Professor Got Right:**

Dr. Patel nailed it, people. His scholarly translation captures the doctrinal precision of these verses—the mind-primacy teaching, the psychological mechanics of karma, the crucial distinction between knowing and doing. His footnotes bring the philosophical depth: this ain't just folk wisdom, it's a complete psychology of liberation.

Particularly strong:
- The opening verses on mind being the boss of everything
- The explanation of how dwelling on grievances keeps hatred alive
- The heartwood/sapwood metaphor for true vs. false values
- The recognition that karma is psychological causation, not cosmic accounting

**What to Emphasize in the Blues Version:**

The Professor gives us the map—now I gotta make it SING. These teachings need to land in the gut, not just the brain. The Buddha's talking about real-life suffering and real-life freedom, and the Blues vernacular is perfect for this because:

1. Blues knows about mind creating reality (every blues song starts with a thought)
2. Blues understands karma (you reap what you sow, what goes around comes around)
3. Blues recognizes the difference between talking about troubles and being enslaved by them
4. Blues is about facing hard truths and finding freedom

I need to keep the Buddhist precision but make it sound like testimony from someone who's LIVED this, not just studied it.

## The Twin Verses: Blues Style

### Opening Words

These are called the Twin Verses 'cause they come in pairs, like the two sides of your life. One side shows you what happens when you get it wrong, the other shows you what happens when you get it right. The Buddha's laying out the whole deal right here at the start: your mind writes the first verse of your life's song, and everything that follows flows from that.

---

### Verses 1-2: Your Mind Writes the First Verse

**The Blues Truth:**

Listen here, baby—  
Everything starts upstairs in your head.  
Your mind's the boss of this whole operation,  
The director of your movie,  
The one writing the first line of every song you sing.

You wake up with poison in your thinking,  
Spite and greed running your show,  
Then open your mouth or make your move—  
Misery gonna follow you like a bloodhound.  
Like the wheel rolling behind that old ox pulling the cart,  
Ain't no way to shake it.  
You created it, now it's tracking you down.

But you wake up with clear water in your mind,  
Kindness and truth running your show,  
Then speak your piece or make your move—  
Joy gonna stick to you like your shadow at noon.  
Can't lose it even if you tried.  
That's just how it works.

**Blues Notes:** The Pali word *dhamma* here means everything you experience. The Buddha's saying your mental state DETERMINES how your life goes. This ain't mystical—it's testable. Try waking up bitter and see what kind of day you have. Try waking up grateful and see the difference. Your mind writes verse one. Everything else is chorus and bridge.

---

### Verses 3-4: Don't Keep Singing That Sad Song

**The Blues Truth:**

Now here's where it gets real—  
Somebody done you wrong.  
They lied on you, cheated you,  
Beat you down, took what's yours.  
That's the truth, that's what happened.

But now you got a choice:

You can sit up all night  
Singing that same song:  
"He abused me, he struck me,  
He beat me, he robbed me"—  
Play it over and over like a scratched record,  
Let it run through your mind on repeat.

You do that?  
The hate don't never quit.  
It's gonna grow like mold in a damp basement.  
Gonna own you more than that person who wronged you ever did.

OR—

You can know what happened,  
You can name it true,  
But you don't gotta rehearse it every day.  
You don't gotta make it your theme song.  
You can put that record back in the sleeve.

Do THAT?  
The hate dies down.  
Finds its rest.  
Leaves you free to write a new chorus.

**Blues Notes:** This ain't about being a doormat. The Buddha's not saying "let people walk all over you." He's saying: continuing to nurse your resentment is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. The event is over. The rehearsal—that's on you. That's what keeps the suffering alive.

---

### Verse 5: The Old, Old Law

**The Blues Truth:**

Let me tell you something about the old laws,  
The ones that were true before your grandmama was born  
And gonna be true after your great-grandkids are dust:

You can't put out fire with fire.  
You can't stop hate with hate.  
Fight poison with poison, all you get is more poison.

Only way to kill that hate  
Is to meet it with something else entirely.  
Meet it with non-hate.  
Meet it with love, or at least with letting go.  
Meet it with "I ain't carrying this no more."

That's the law.  
Old as the hills.  
You can buck against it if you want,  
But it ain't gonna change.

**Blues Notes:** *Averena*—non-hatred. Not weakness. Not "like 'em anyway." Just refusing to let hate set up shop in your heart. Gandhi knew this. King knew this. Every blues singer who found freedom instead of bitterness knew this. It's dharma, and it's also just how things work.

---

### Verse 6: We're All Dying Here

**The Blues Truth:**

Most folks walking around  
Don't really get it:  
We're all dying here.  
Every one of us.  
Your time, my time—  
It's running out while we stand here arguing  
About who said what and who owes who.

But the wise ones,  
The ones who've sat with death long enough  
To know it's real—  
They stop fighting about small things.

When you know you got limited time,  
When you know this whole thing ends,  
You ain't got energy to waste  
On quarrels that don't matter.

The argument ends itself  
When you remember:  
We're all perishing here.

**Blues Notes:** *Yamāmase*—we are dying, we are perishing. Memento mori. The blues knows this truth in its bones: nobody gets out alive. That knowledge either makes you bitter or makes you free. The wise let it make them free, let it show them what actually matters.

---

### Verses 7-8: Weak Trees and Mountains

**The Blues Truth:**

Two kinds of people in this world:

**The Weak Tree:**

You spend your days  
Chasing every pretty thing that walks by,  
Letting your eyes, your ears, your tongue  
Run wild like kids with no supervision.  
You eat too much, sleep too much,  
Can't get yourself to do the hard work.

You're like a tree with pretty leaves  
But rotten roots.  
First strong wind that comes—  
Temptation, trouble, hard times—  
You going down.  
Māra (that's death, that's delusion, that's destruction)  
Gonna knock you right over.

**The Mountain:**

But you train yourself,  
Keep your senses on a leash,  
Eat what you need and no more,  
Get up every day and do the work,  
Build that faith, build that strength—

You like a mountain.  
Storm can howl,  
Wind can blow,  
Rain can come sideways—  
You ain't moving.  
Māra ain't got nothing on you.  
You're planted too deep.

**Blues Notes:** *Asubha* meditation—contemplating the unattractive reality under the pretty surface. This ain't about hating life; it's about seeing clearly so you don't get knocked over by the first wind that blows. Sense restraint (*indriyesu susaṁvutaṁ*) isn't Puritanism; it's knowing how to drive without crashing.

---

### Verses 9-10: The Robe Don't Make the Monk

**The Blues Truth:**

You can put on the uniform,  
Wear the robe, the collar, the cross,  
Carry the good book,  
Talk the holy talk—

But if your heart's still full of the same old mess,  
If you ain't done the work to clean yourself up,  
If you got no self-control,  
No truth in you—

That robe ain't nothing but a costume.  
You playing dress-up.  
You don't deserve to wear it.

BUT—

If you've spit out all that poison,  
If you've done the hard work of getting clean,  
If your life lines up with what you claim,  
If you got real self-control and real truth in you—

Then you EARNED that robe.  
You got a right to wear it.  
Not 'cause of the cloth,  
But 'cause of who you became.

**Blues Notes:** Buddhism (and Blues) don't care about your costume. They care about your character. *Vantakasāva*—"vomited out the defilements"—is as visceral as it gets. Real spiritual work is ugly, sweaty, and INTERNAL. The outer sign means nothing without the inner transformation.

---

### Verses 11-12: Fool's Gold and Real Gold

**The Blues Truth:**

Lots of folks out here  
Chasing fool's gold,  
Thinking the shiny stuff is real,  
Thinking the real stuff ain't worth nothing.

They mistake:  
- Pleasure for happiness  
- Money for security  
- Fame for worth  
- Comfort for peace

They running after sapwood,  
The soft outside of the tree,  
Thinking it's the heartwood,  
The strong core.

They don't never find  
What they actually need.  
Too busy chasing what glitters.

BUT—

The wise  
They can tell the difference.  
They know heartwood from sapwood,  
Essence from appearance,  
What matters from what don't.

They chase the REAL stuff:  
- Freedom over pleasure  
- Wisdom over information  
- Character over reputation  
- Peace over excitement

And they FIND it.  
'Cause they looking in the right place.

**Blues Notes:** *Sāra* (essence, heartwood) versus *asāra* (non-essence, sapwood). The Buddha's asking: what are you actually chasing? What do you think is valuable? Most folks never question what they were taught to want. The wise question everything and choose what actually leads to freedom.

---

### Verses 13-14: Leaky Roofs and Good Roofs

**The Blues Truth:**

Your mind is like a house,  
And desire is like rain.

**The Leaky House:**

You ain't done no maintenance on your mind,  
Ain't trained it,  
Ain't developed it,  
Ain't built up no protection—

When the rain of wanting comes,  
It's gonna pour right through.  
Soak everything.  
Ruin your peace.  
Flood your whole life.

You gonna be miserable,  
Sitting there in a puddle,  
Wondering why you're wet.

**The Solid House:**

But you do the work,  
You train your mind through meditation,  
Develop it through practice,  
Build it strong through discipline—

When that same rain comes,  
It just runs off.  
Don't get inside.  
Don't disturb nothing.

You stay dry.  
You stay peaceful.  
The want comes, but it don't rule you.

**Blues Notes:** *Bhāvanā*—mental development, cultivation. This is Buddhism's core technology. You wouldn't leave your actual house with holes in the roof. Why leave your mind unprotected? The work of meditation and ethical training isn't optional decoration—it's the roof that keeps you dry.

---

### Verses 15-16: Now and Later

**The Blues Truth:**

Two roads, two destinations.

**The Sorrow Road:**

You do wrong—  
Harm folks, lie, steal, destroy—

You hurt RIGHT NOW.  
Conscience eating at you,  
Shame following you around,  
Can't look yourself in the mirror.

And you hurt LATER.  
When the consequences roll around  
(And they always do),  
You hurt even worse.

You look at what you did—  
See that stain on your own hands—  
And you grieve both places:  
Here and hereafter.

**The Joy Road:**

But you do right—  
Help folks, tell truth, build up, protect—

You FEEL GOOD right now.  
That clean-conscience peace,  
That "I did right" satisfaction,  
Looking yourself in the mirror with no shame.

And you feel BETTER later.  
When the good you did comes back around,  
When you see your deeds were clean,  
You rejoice even more.

Joy here,  
Greater joy there.

**Blues Notes:** Karma ain't punishment from above—it's the natural psychological consequence of your actions. Do harm, carry the weight of it. Do good, carry the lightness of it. Both immediate and long-term. The Buddha's being ruthlessly empirical: you can test this TODAY.

---

### Verses 17-18: Burning and Bliss

**The Blues Truth:**

This is verses 15-16, but INTENSIFIED.

**The Burning:**

You do evil,  
You BURN right now.  
"I did that terrible thing"—  
That thought alone scorches you.

Then later,  
When you end up in the bad places  
(Whatever hell looks like for you—  
Addiction, prison, isolation, regret),  
You burn HOTTER.

The fire don't quit,  
It GROWS.

**The Bliss:**

You do good,  
You REJOICE right now.  
"I did that beautiful thing"—  
That thought alone lifts you up.

Then later,  
When you end up in the good places  
(Whatever heaven looks like for you—  
Peace, community, freedom, love),  
You rejoice EVEN MORE.

The joy don't quit,  
It MULTIPLIES.

**Blues Notes:** *Tappati* (burn) versus *nandati* (rejoice). The progression from sorrow/joy to burning/bliss shows how karma COMPOUNDS. The initial consequence grows. This is either the best news or the worst news you've ever heard, depending on what you've been doing.

---

### Verses 19-20: Talking Ain't Walking

**The Blues Truth:**

**The Scholar Who Don't Walk:**

You can memorize every holy book,  
Quote scripture all day long,  
Sound real smart,  
Impress folks at parties—

But if you ain't DOING it,  
If you ain't living what you're reading,  
You like a cowherd  
Counting somebody else's cows.

They ain't YOUR cows.  
That ain't YOUR wisdom.  
You got no share in the real wealth.

All you got is information  
About somebody else's transformation.

**The Practitioner Who Walks:**

But say you only know a LITTLE bit—  
Maybe just one teaching,  
Maybe just the basics—

But you LIVE it.  
You actually give up your greed,  
You actually let go of your hate,  
You actually see through your delusions.

You practice what you know,  
You walk what you talk,  
You get FREE in your mind,  
You stop clinging to anything—

THAT'S the spiritual life.  
THAT'S having a share in the wealth.  
Not what you memorized,  
But what you BECAME.

**Blues Notes:** *Sāmaññassa bhāgavā*—"having a share in the spiritual life." The Buddha's final word in chapter one: transformation beats information. Liberation beats erudition. One person walking beats a hundred people talking. This is Buddhism's central claim: it's a PATH, not a philosophy. You gotta walk it.

---

## End of Chapter 1: The Twin Verses

**What We Learned:**

These twenty verses lay out the whole program:
1. Mind runs the show
2. Karma is cause and effect, not divine punishment  
3. Dwelling on grievances keeps you in hell
4. Only non-hate stops hate
5. Remember death—it clarifies everything
6. Train your mind or suffer the consequences
7. Real worth is internal, not external
8. Know what actually matters (not what glitters)
9. Build a strong mind to weather life's storms
10. Practice beats theory every single time

The Buddha gave us the map in pairs—wrong way, right way—so we can see the choice clearly. Now the work is ours.

The Blues has been teaching this all along. Now you got the Buddhist version too.

---

**Blues Notes on Translation Method:**

I kept Dr. Patel's doctrinal precision but translated it into the language of lived experience. Every metaphor, every image, every teaching—I put it in terms that speak to someone facing real struggle, real temptation, real life.

Buddhism says: your mind creates your world, karma is real, liberation is possible, practice is everything.

Blues says: what you think determines what you get, you reap what you sow, freedom is the goal, you gotta walk it out.

Same dharma. Different voice. Both true.

---

# Chapter 2: Appamādavagga - Blues Edition  
## Heedfulness: Staying Woke on the Path

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## The Professor's Translation Review

**What the Professor Got Right:**

Dr. Patel captured the urgency of *appamāda* (heedfulness) as THE difference between spiritual life and spiritual death. His footnotes nail the Buddha's final words connection, the island metaphor as self-refuge, and heedfulness as wealth that the wise guard. Strong work on showing this isn't grim duty but source of joy.

**Additional Nuances to Emphasize:**

Make *appamāda* visceral and immediate—this is about staying awake to your life RIGHT NOW, not abstract vigilance. The Blues knows about being asleep to what matters and the sudden wake-up call. Heedfulness = paying attention, staying woke, not sleepwalking through your one precious life.

---

## Opening Words

This chapter's about STAYING AWAKE. The Buddha's talking about *appamāda*—heedfulness, diligence, paying attention, staying woke to what's real. It's the difference between living and being a walking corpse. Between making it to freedom and dying in your sleep. 

These twelve verses say it plain: Wake up. Stay awake. Don't drift. Don't sleepwalk. Your life depends on it.

---

### Verses 21-22: Wake Up or Stay Dead

**The Blues Truth:**

Wakefulness, wakefulness—that's the deathless road.  
Sleepwalking, sleepwalking—that's where the dead folks go.

Stay woke and you don't die.  
Stay sleep and you're already gone.  
Stay woke and you don't die.  
Stay sleep—might as well be dead.

The wise ones, they understand.  
The wise ones, they feel this truth.  
So they love staying awake,  
Love the place where the awakened dwell.  
Rejoice in paying attention,  
Rejoice in the Noble Ones' way.

**Blues Notes:** *Amatapadaṁ* (the deathless state) and *maccuno padaṁ* (death's domain). The repetition in "wakefulness, wakefulness" and "sleepwalking, sleepwalking" mirrors the Pali parallelism of *appamādo/pamādo*. When you're truly awake to this moment, you're standing in the deathless. When you're asleep—scrolling, numbing, ignoring what's real—you're already gone.

---

### Verse 23: The Meditators Who Keep At It

**The Blues Truth:**

Sit down, sit down, keep on sitting.  
Show up, show up, day after day.  
Don't quit, don't quit when it gets hard.  
Stay firm, stay firm in the practice.

Those who meditate—they touch Nibbāna.  
Those who persist—they find release.  
The ultimate freedom,  
The bond-breaking peace.

**Blues Notes:** *Jhāyino sātatikā* (meditators who are constant). The repetition honors the Pali emphasis on *sātatikā* (constant, unbroken). Not occasional practice but unbroken continuity—that's what breaks through.

---

### Verse 24: The One Who Does the Work

**The Blues Truth:**

For the person who gets up and does the work,  
Who stays mindful,  
Whose actions are clean,  
Who thinks before they move,  
Who's got self-control,  
Who lives by the teachings,  
Who stays awake—

That person's reputation grows.  
Not 'cause they're chasing fame,  
But 'cause truth shines through.

**Blues Notes:** Six qualities that build on each other: active, mindful, pure deeds, thoughtful action, self-controlled, living by Dhamma. You can't fake heedfulness—it shows in everything you do. *Yasobhivaḍḍhati* (fame increases) is the natural result of genuine practice, not ego-driven status.

---

### Verse 25: Build Your Island

**The Blues Truth:**

Through effort, through wakefulness,  
Through self-control, through restraint—  
Through effort, through wakefulness,  
Through self-control, through restraint—

Build, build, build your island.  
Build, build your higher ground.  
When the flood comes rising—  
And the flood WILL come—  
You got a place to stand.

**Blues Notes:** *Dīpaṁ kayirātha* ("make an island"). The fourfold repetition mirrors the four qualities listed in the Pali. Nobody's gonna rescue you. You gotta build your own refuge through your own effort. Your island is your practice, built one day at a time.

---

### Verses 26-27: Fools Sleep, Wise Stay Woke

**The Blues Truth:**

Fools cultivate sleep, cultivate sleep.  
Fools practice drifting, practice drifting.  
Fools perfect their heedlessness—  
That's what fools do.

But the wise one guards wakefulness,  
Guards wakefulness like gold.  
The wise one protects attention  
Like the treasure that it is.

Don't cultivate drifting—  
Don't get cozy with pleasure.  
Stay awake, stay meditating—  
THAT'S where happiness lives.  
The real kind. The lasting kind.

**Blues Notes:** The parallel structure (fools do X / wise do Y) mirrors the Pali contrast of *bālā dummedhino* vs. *medhāvī*. What the world calls "living it up" Buddhism calls poverty. What looks like hard work—that's the real wealth.

---

### Verse 28: The View from the Mountain

**The Blues Truth:**

When the wise one pushes out sleepwalking  
By practicing staying awake,  
Climbs up to wisdom's high place,  
Free from grief themselves—

They look out and see all the grieving people below,  
Like someone standing on a mountain  
Looking down at folks stuck on the flatlands.

**Blues Notes:** This ain't arrogance—it's perspective. When you wake up, you see clearly how much suffering comes from being asleep. *Paññāpāsāda* (palace of wisdom)—wisdom gives you space, elevation, clear sight. The fools aren't foolish 'cause they're bad people; they just can't see from where they're standing.

---

### Verse 29: The Fast Horse and the Slow Horse

**The Blues Truth:**

Heedful among the heedless,  
Wakeful among the sleeping,  
Heedful among the heedless,  
Wakeful among the sleeping—

The sage moves on, moves on,  
Like a fast horse leaving the slow one.  
Not racing—just different speed.  
Momentum from paying attention.

**Blues Notes:** The doubled opening lines mirror the Pali parallelism *appamatto pamattesu, suttesu bahujāgaro*. When you're heedful, you cover ground—not through competition, but through sustained effort.

---

### Verse 30: How the King of Gods Got His Throne

**The Blues Truth:**

Maghavā—the king of the gods himself—  
Got to the top through staying awake.  
Through heedfulness.

People praise wakefulness.  
Everybody blames sleep.  
This ain't controversial.  
It's just true.

**Blues Notes:** Maghavā (Sakka, Indra) didn't inherit divine kingship—he PRACTICED his way there as a human being. Even gods are made through effort. Your station isn't fixed by birth or fate, but by how you practice.

---

### Verses 31-32: The Monk Who Can't Fall

**The Blues Truth:**

A monk who delights in wakefulness,  
Who sees danger in sleep—  
A monk who delights in wakefulness,  
Who sees danger in sleep—

Burns, burns, burns through the bindings,  
Like fire burns through rope.  
Big bindings, little bindings,  
All of it—consumed.

A monk who delights in wakefulness,  
Who sees danger in sleep—  
A monk who delights in wakefulness,  
Who sees danger in sleep—

Can't fall back. Can't regress.  
Can't fall back. Can't fall.  
Standing right at Nibbāna's door.

**Blues Notes:** The doubled lines honor the Pali's exact repetition of *appamādarato bhikkhu, pamāde bhayadassivā* in both verses. The ten fetters (*saṁyojana*) burn away through insight's heat. *Abhabbo parihānāya*—there's a point of no return on this path.

---

## End of Chapter 2: Heedfulness

**What We Learned:**

These twelve verses teach one thing:  
WAKE UP. STAY AWAKE.

1. Wakefulness is life itself; sleep is death
2. The wise love staying present
3. Constant practice touches freedom
4. Your work shows in your life
5. Build your own refuge—nobody else can
6. Fools sleep; wise stay woke
7. Real happiness comes from attention, not distraction
8. Wisdom gives you perspective
9. Heedfulness creates momentum
10. Even gods are made through practice
11. Fire burns fetters, heedfulness burns bondage
12. The awake one can't fall—they're at liberation's door

The Buddha's final words were about THIS: "All things decay. Work out your salvation with diligence."

*Appamāda*. Heedfulness. Staying awake. Paying attention.

It's the difference between living and dying.  
It's the path itself.  
It's how you get free.

---

**Blues Notes on Translation Method:**

Every verse in this chapter comes back to one thing: are you awake or asleep? The Blues knows this territory—every blues song is about waking up to hard truths, staying present with pain and joy, not numbing out. The Buddha's teaching and the Blues are singing the same song: WAKE UP. Your life depends on it.

---

# Chapter 3: Cittavagga - Blues Edition
## The Mind: Training the Wildest Thing You Own

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

Your mind. It's the wildest horse you ever tried to ride. Faster than thought—well, it IS thought. Slipperier than water. Can't see it, can't touch it, but it runs your whole life. 

These eleven verses are about one thing: train your mind, or it'll run you into the ground. Point it right, you got the best friend you could ever have. Point it wrong, you got your worst enemy living right inside your skull.

---

### Verses 33-34: The Mind Like a Fish, Like an Arrow

**The Blues Truth:**

Your mind, your mind—  
It's shaking, it's twitching.  
Your mind, your mind—  
Can't guard it, can't hold it.

But the wise one straightens that mind,  
Straightens it slow and true,  
Like a fletcher straightening an arrow,  
Patient, skilled, seeing it through.

Your mind's like a fish thrown on dry land,  
Flopping, gasping, wild with fear—  
That's what happens when you pull it from distraction,  
That's the panic when you try to train it here.

But that's exactly why you train it,  
That's exactly why you try—  
Use the panic to throw off Māra,  
Learn to straighten, not to die.

**Blues Notes:** The Pali uses two vivid images: *usukāro va tejanaṁ* (like a fletcher with an arrow) and *vārijo va thale khitto* (like a fish thrown on land). The mind resists training—it *panics* when removed from its habitual distractions. But that very agitation can motivate liberation.

### Verses 35-36: Guard What You Can't See

**The Blues Truth:**

Hard to tame, hard to tame,  
Flits wherever it wants.  
Hard to tame, hard to tame,  
Restraint is good—restraint brings peace.

Hard to see, hard to see,  
Subtle as smoke in the dark.  
Hard to see, hard to see,  
Guard it well—guarding brings peace.

A restrained mind brings happiness.  
A guarded mind brings happiness.  
Don't let it run wild—  
Chain it with kindness,  
Leash it with love.

**Blues Notes:** The parallel structure of verses 35-36 in Pali (*dunniggahassa...cittassa damatho sādhu* / *sududdasaṁ sunipuṇaṁ...cittaṁ rakkhetha*) creates a rhythmic pairing: restraint (damatha) and guarding (gutta) both lead to happiness (sukhāvaha). The repetition emphasizes: same teaching, same result.

---

### Verse 37: The Mind That Roams Far

**The Blues Truth:**

It roams far, roams alone,  
Has no body, hides in a cave.  
It roams far, roams alone—  
But those who restrain it get free.

Can't see it, can't touch it,  
But it runs your whole life.  
Can't see it, can't touch it—  
Tame it and cut loose from strife.

Māra's bonds—Māra's bonds—  
Those who tame mind break free.  
Māra's bonds—Māra's bonds—  
That's the only way to be free.

**Blues Notes:** Four qualities of mind: *dūraṅgama* (far-roaming), *ekacara* (wandering alone), *asarīra* (bodiless), *guhāsaya* (hidden in a cave—the heart). This invisible, elusive thing determines everything. The verse promises: *mokkhanti Mārabandhanā*—they gain release from Māra's bonds.

---

### Verses 38-39: Unsettled and Settled

**The Blues Truth:**

Unsettled mind, unsettled mind,  
Doesn't know the True Teaching.  
Unsettled mind, unsettled mind,  
Confidence wavers, wisdom never fills up.

BUT—

Free from lust, free from confusion,  
Abandoned both merit and sin.  
Free from lust, free from confusion,  
For the wakeful—no fear. Not within.

Nothing left to lose,  
Nothing left to protect.  
When you've let go of everything,  
What is there left to deflect?

**Blues Notes:** The contrast couldn't be starker. Verse 38: *anavaṭṭhitacitta* (unsettled mind) → unfulfilled wisdom. Verse 39: *anavassutacitta* (mind free from lust) → no fear. *Puññapāpapahīnassa* (having abandoned merit and demerit) describes the arahat—beyond karma accumulation entirely.

---

### Verse 40: The Jar and the Fortress

**The Blues Truth:**

Your body, your body—  
Fragile like a clay pot.  
Drop it and it shatters.  
That's what you got.

Your mind, your mind—  
Build it like a fortress.  
Stone walls and strong gates.  
Nothing gets past this.

Fight Māra with wisdom,  
That's the only weapon that works.  
Guard what you've won—  
But don't cling to the perks.

Win the battle,  
Then let go of the win.  
That's the way, that's the way—  
That's how you begin.

**Blues Notes:** *Kumbhūpama* (like a jar) for body; *nagarūpama* (like a fortress) for mind. The body's fragility contrasts with the mind's potential strength. *Paññāvudhena* (with wisdom's weapon)—the only thing that actually defeats Māra. *Anivesano siyā* (remain unattached)—don't cling even to your spiritual victories.

---

### Verse 41: The Body's Fate

**The Blues Truth:**

Soon, soon, this body  
Will lie on the ground.  
Soon, soon, this body  
Will lie there without sound.

Rejected, abandoned,  
No consciousness inside.  
Just a useless piece of wood—  
That's what happens when you've died.

So what are you waiting for?  
What are you waiting for?  
Train your mind NOW—  
Before it lies on the floor.

**Blues Notes:** *Aciraṁ* (before long, soon) creates urgency. *Chuddho apetaviññāṇo* (rejected, without consciousness)—the corpse is explicitly compared to *niratthaṁ va kaliṅgaraṁ* (a useless piece of wood). This isn't morbid—it's motivation. Time is running out.

---

### Verses 42-43: Your Worst Enemy, Your Best Friend

**The Blues Truth:**

What an enemy does to an enemy,  
What an aggressor does to a foe—  
A wrongly-directed mind  
Does worse to you than they'll ever know.

Your mind turned against you,  
Your mind pointed wrong—  
Worse than any enemy,  
Hurts you deep and long.

BUT—

What your mama couldn't do for you,  
What your daddy couldn't give,  
What no relative could offer—  
A rightly-directed mind helps you live.

Your mind turned toward you,  
Your mind pointed right—  
Better than any gift,  
Better than any light.

Point it right, point it right,  
Better than any kin.  
Point it wrong, point it wrong,  
Worse than any sin.

**Blues Notes:** The closing twin verses summarize the chapter: *micchāpaṇihita citta* (wrongly-directed mind) is your worst enemy; *sammāpaṇihita citta* (rightly-directed mind) is your best friend—better than what even your mother and father could do for you. Liberation only YOU can give yourself.

---

## End of Chapter 3: The Mind

**What We Learned:**

1. Your mind's wild—train it like a fletcher trains an arrow
2. It panics when you start training—like a fish on dry land
3. Restraint is good, guarding is good—both bring happiness
4. It roams far, hides in a cave—but tame it and break free
5. Unsettled mind = unfulfilled wisdom
6. Settled mind = no fear, nothing left to lose
7. Body fragile like a jar—mind strong like a fortress
8. Fight Māra with wisdom, then let go of the victory
9. Soon this body will be useless wood—train the mind NOW
10. Wrongly-directed mind is your worst enemy
11. Rightly-directed mind is your best friend—better than mama or daddy ever could be

Your mind, your mind—  
Train it or be trained BY it.  
Point it right or suffer wrong.  
That's the whole chapter's song.

---

**Blues Notes on Translation Method:**

The mind chapter demanded imagery that captures both wildness and trainability. The Blues knows this territory—every Blues singer has wrestled with their own mind, faced demons inside their own skull, learned to direct thought toward freedom instead of destruction. The Buddha and the Blues agree: your mind is either your best friend or your worst enemy. YOU decide which by how you train it.

# Chapter 4: Pupphavagga - Blues Edition
## Flowers: What Blooms and What Fades

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

The Buddha loved flowers. Used 'em to teach about everything—life, death, virtue, awakening. This chapter's all about what blooms and what fades. About gathering nectar without hurting what you take from. About virtue that rises like perfume against the wind. And about the lotus—that beautiful thing that grows right out of the mud.

---

### Verses 44-45: Who Knows the Dhamma Like a Flower?

**The Blues Truth:**

Who will know this earth?  
Who will know this earth?  
Who will know the realms below and the heavens above?

Who reflects on Dhamma,  
Who reflects on Dhamma,  
Like someone skilled reflecting on a flower's face?

The trainee knows this earth.  
The trainee knows this earth.  
The trainee knows the realms below and the heavens above.

The trainee reflects on Dhamma,  
The trainee reflects on Dhamma,  
Like someone skilled reflecting on a flower's face.

**Blues Notes:** The question-and-answer format (*ko...sekho*) creates call-and-response. The *sekha* (trainee) is on the path but not yet arrived—still learning to see the teachings like a florist sees blooms, with trained discernment.

---

### Verse 46: Body Like Foam

**The Blues Truth:**

This body, this body—  
It's foam on the water.  
This body, this body—  
It's a mirage in the heat.

See it for what it is,  
See it for what it is,  
Cut off Māra's pretty arrows tipped with flowers.

Go beyond where Death can see,  
Go beyond where Death can find,  
Go beyond, go beyond—  
Leave the King of Death behind.

**Blues Notes:** Three images of insubstantiality: *pheṇūpama* (like froth), *marīcidhamma* (mirage-nature), and *papupphakāni* (flower-adorned arrows—seductive but deadly). Seeing through all three deceptions leads beyond Death's sight.

---

### Verses 47-48: Gathering Flowers When Death Comes

**The Blues Truth:**

Gathering flowers, gathering flowers,  
Mind attached to what you're picking—  
Death comes, Death comes,  
Like a flood sweeping a sleeping village.

Gathering flowers, gathering flowers,  
Never satisfied with pleasures—  
Death comes, Death comes,  
Takes you before you're ever full.

Never satisfied, never satisfied,  
Still wanting more when Death arrives.  
Never satisfied, never satisfied,  
That's how the distracted dies.

**Blues Notes:** *Pupphāni pacinanta* (gathering flowers) = chasing pleasures. The repetition mirrors Pali's exact reuse of lines across both verses. *Atittaṁ yeva kāmesu* (unsated in sense-pleasures)—Death comes before desire is ever satisfied. That's the tragedy.

---

### Verse 49: Be Like the Bee

**The Blues Truth:**

The bee takes nectar, takes nectar,  
But doesn't hurt the flower.  
The bee takes nectar, takes nectar,  
Doesn't damage color or scent.

Be like the bee, be like the bee,  
Roam through the village light.  
Take what you need, take what you need,  
But leave the source all right.

**Blues Notes:** *Aheṭhayaṁ* (without harming)—the sage on alms-round receives without depleting. This is sustainable spiritual practice: taking sustenance without destroying what gives it.

---

### Verse 50: Mind Your Own Business

**The Blues Truth:**

Not what others did wrong,  
Not what others did wrong.  
Not what they did or didn't do—  
That's none of your concern.

Look at what YOU did wrong,  
Look at what YOU did wrong.  
What you did and didn't do—  
THAT'S your business to learn.

**Blues Notes:** *Na paresaṁ vilomāni* (not others' wrongs). The untrained mind loves judging others. But *attano va avekkheyya*—look at your own deeds. Judgment wastes energy; self-examination builds freedom.

---

### Verses 51-52: Flowers With and Without Scent

**The Blues Truth:**

A beautiful flower with no scent,  
A beautiful flower with no scent—  
That's like pretty words from someone  
Who don't do what they meant.

Talk is pretty but empty,  
Talk is pretty but empty,  
When you don't walk what you say.

A beautiful flower WITH fragrance,  
A beautiful flower WITH fragrance—  
That's like truth from someone  
Who lives it every day.

Talk bears fruit when you do it,  
Talk bears fruit when you do it,  
When you walk what you say.

**Blues Notes:** Classic twin-verse structure: *agandhakaṁ* (without fragrance) vs. *sagandhakaṁ* (with fragrance). The parallel emphasizes: words without action = scentless flower. Words with action = the real bloom.

---

### Verse 53: Make Garlands from Your Life

**The Blues Truth:**

From a heap of flowers,  
From a heap of flowers,  
Make many, many garlands.

From your mortal life,  
From your mortal life,  
Do many, many goods.

You're born, you'll die—  
You're born, you'll die—  
So weave something beautiful while you can.

**Blues Notes:** *Jātena maccena* (one born mortal) emphasizes our limited time. The heap of flowers is our opportunities; the garlands are our good deeds. Weave while you can—the flowers will wilt.

---

### Verses 54-56: Virtue's Fragrance Rises

**The Blues Truth:**

Flower perfume follows the wind,  
Flower perfume follows the wind—  
Sandalwood, jasmine, all go where the breeze blows.

But virtue's fragrance?  
Virtue's fragrance?  
Goes AGAINST the wind, spreads everywhere.

Sandalwood, jasmine, water lily—  
All those pretty scents—  
Nothing compared to virtue,  
Nothing compared to living right.

Virtue rises, virtue rises,  
All the way to the gods.  
Virtue rises, virtue rises,  
Supreme beyond all odds.

**Blues Notes:** *Sīlagandha* (virtue's fragrance) defies physics—spreads *paṭivātam* (against the wind), reaches *devesu* (among the gods). Three verses build: virtue surpasses all natural fragrances, rises to heaven, is *anuttara* (unsurpassed).

---

### Verse 57: Māra Can't Find You

**The Blues Truth:**

Virtuous, virtuous—  
Living heedfully.  
Freed by knowing, freed by knowing—  
Māra can't find the way.

Can't find your path,  
Can't track you down,  
Can't follow where you've gone.  
You've disappeared from evil's sight—  
You've moved beyond, moved on.

**Blues Notes:** *Māro maggaṁ na vindati* (Māra cannot find the path). Three qualities make you invisible to evil: *sampannasīla* (endowed with virtue), *appamādavihāri* (living heedfully), *sammad-aññāvimutta* (freed through right knowledge).

---

### Verses 58-59: The Lotus in the Garbage

**The Blues Truth:**

On a garbage heap, garbage heap,  
Thrown by the highway side—  
A lotus grows, a lotus grows,  
Pure and beautiful inside.

Sweet-scented, mind-delighting,  
Rising from the muck and grime.  
That's the lotus, that's the lotus,  
Blooming in the worst of times.

Among the blind folks, ordinary folks,  
Living in delusion's dark—  
The Buddha's student shines, just shines,  
Wisdom lighting up the heart.

Outshines with wisdom, outshines with wisdom,  
Like the lotus from the mud.  
Outshines with wisdom, outshines with wisdom—  
That's the meaning of the bud.

**Blues Notes:** *Saṅkāradhāna* (garbage heap) becomes the ground for *paduma* (lotus). This is Buddhism's beloved image: awakening emerges FROM samsara, not despite it. The muck is necessary—no mud, no lotus. *Atirocati paññāya* (outshines through wisdom)—the disciple rises brilliant from ordinary darkness.

---

## End of Chapter 4: Flowers

**What We Learned:**

1. The trainee reflects on Dhamma like a skilled florist on flowers
2. Body is foam and mirage—see through it
3. Death takes the flower-gatherer before they're ever satisfied
4. Be like the bee—take nectar without harming
5. Mind your own business, not others' wrongs
6. Words without action = scentless flower
7. Words with action = fragrant bloom
8. Make garlands of good deeds from your mortal life
9. Virtue's fragrance goes against the wind
10. Virtue rises all the way to the gods
11. Māra can't find the path of the virtuous
12. The lotus rises from the garbage heap—so can you

From the mud, from the mud,  
The lotus rises clean.  
From this mess, from this life,  
Wisdom blooms supreme.

---

**Blues Notes on Translation Method:**

Flower imagery runs deep in the Blues—roses, lilies, blossoms that fade. The Buddha's teaching and the Blues agree: beauty is temporary, but what you DO with your life—the garlands you weave, the fragrance you leave behind—that's what matters. And the lotus? That's hope. That's the promise that something pure can rise from the dirtiest conditions. Every Blues singer knows that truth.

---

# Chapter 5: Bālavagga - Blues Edition
## Fools: Your Own Worst Enemy

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

Fools. The Buddha's got a lot to say about 'em. Not stupid people—people who refuse to learn. People who make the same mistakes over and over. People who carry their worst enemy inside their own skull. This chapter holds up a mirror. Don't flinch if you see yourself.

---

### Verse 60: Long is the Night

**The Blues Truth:**

Long is the night, long is the night  
When you can't find sleep.  
Long is the road, long is the road  
When your body's weak.

But longer still, LONGER STILL  
Is the wheel of birth and death  
For fools who won't learn Dhamma,  
Won't learn it with their last breath.

Long for the sleepless.  
Longer for the tired.  
Longest for the fools  
Who never get it right.

**Blues Notes:** *Dīgha* (long) repeats three times with increasing stakes: sleepless night → exhausting journey → endless rebirths. The fool's suffering extends because they refuse the teaching that would end it.

---

### Verse 61: Walk Alone If You Must

**The Blues Truth:**

If you can't find someone better,  
If you can't find someone the same,  
Walk alone, walk alone—  
There's no friendship in a fool's game.

Better lonely, better lonely  
Than bad company.  
Better lonely, better lonely  
Than dragging down your destiny.

No friendship with fools.  
No friendship with fools.  
Walk alone if you must—  
That's the wise one's rules.

**Blues Notes:** *Ekacariyaṁ daḷhaṁ kayirā* (firmly resolve to go alone). Better solitude than corrupting companionship. Bad companions drag you down faster than you can lift them up.

---

### Verse 62: Nothing Is Yours

**The Blues Truth:**

"Sons are mine! Riches are mine!"  
So the fool worries and frets.  
"Sons are mine! Riches are mine!"  
Piling up phantom debts.

But if your SELF ain't even yours—  
And friend, it ain't, it ain't—  
How can sons be? How can gold be?  
Nothing's yours beyond the paint.

Nothing's yours, nothing's yours,  
Not even the one who's grabbing.  
Nothing's yours, nothing's yours—  
Stop all that grabbing.

**Blues Notes:** *Attā hi attano natthi* (even self is not one's own). If the "I" that supposedly owns things is impermanent and ownerless, what can truly belong to it? The fool's vexation comes from claiming what cannot be claimed.

---

### Verse 63: The Wise Fool

**The Blues Truth:**

A fool who knows he's foolish—  
At least he's got that right.  
A fool who knows he's foolish—  
Got a little spark of light.

But a fool proud of his wisdom,  
Thinking he's the smartest one—  
HE'S the fool, the REAL fool,  
Can't learn nothing—he's done.

Know you don't know, know you don't know,  
That's where wisdom starts.  
Think you know it all already—  
That's the foolish heart.

**Blues Notes:** *Paṇḍitamānī* (proud of wisdom, thinking oneself wise) is the real danger. The fool who believes himself wise cannot learn. Knowing you don't know is the beginning of knowledge.

---

### Verses 64-65: The Spoon and the Tongue

**The Blues Truth:**

A fool can sit with a wise man,  
Sit with him his whole life long—  
Won't learn a drop of Dhamma,  
Like a spoon that can't taste the song.

Spoon in the curry, spoon in the curry,  
Stirs it every day—  
Never tastes a single bite,  
That's the foolish way.

BUT—

A perceptive one sits with a wise man  
For just a moment's time—  
Learns the Dhamma quick as lightning,  
Like the tongue that tastes the rhyme.

Tongue tastes curry, tongue tastes curry,  
First bite and it knows—  
That's the perceptive way,  
That's the way wisdom grows.

**Blues Notes:** *Dabbī sūparasaṁ yathā* (as a spoon the taste of curry). The famous simile: despite constant immersion in wisdom, the fool never absorbs it. Capacity to learn (*viññū*) determines results, not duration of exposure.

---

### Verse 66: Your Own Enemy

**The Blues Truth:**

Stupid fools walk around  
With their worst enemy inside.  
Stupid fools carry  
What they can't outrun or hide.

Doing wicked deeds, doing wicked deeds,  
Planting bitter fruit.  
Your own hands sow the seeds—  
You're your own enemy at the root.

Enemy inside, enemy inside,  
Doing harm to yourself.  
Nobody hurts you like YOU do  
When you're working against your health.

**Blues Notes:** *Amitteneva attanā* (with themselves as enemy). The fool's tragedy is self-inflicted. Every wicked deed produces bitter fruit—and you're the one planting.

---

### Verses 67-68: Regret and Relief

**The Blues Truth:**

That deed ain't well done, ain't well done,  
That leaves tears on your face.  
That deed ain't well done, ain't well done,  
When the result tracks you down to your place.

BUT—

That deed IS well done, IS well done,  
That leaves peace in your heart.  
That deed IS well done, IS well done,  
When the result's a fresh start.

Tears on your face? Bad deed.  
Peace in your heart? Good.  
That's how you know, that's how you know  
If you did what you should.

**Blues Notes:** Simple test: *anutappati* (regret) marks bad deeds; *nānutappati* (no regret) marks good. Your own heart tells you the truth.

---

### Verse 69: Sweet Until It Ripens

**The Blues Truth:**

The fool thinks it's sweet, thinks it's sweet,  
While the deed is still young.  
The fool thinks it's sweet, thinks it's sweet—  
Hasn't felt where it's heading from.

But when that deed ripens, ripens,  
When it finally comes true—  
The fool suffers, suffers, suffers,  
Bitter after the sweet he knew.

Sweet now. Bitter later.  
Sweet now. Bitter later.  
That's the karma of the fool  
Who couldn't see what would come to his table.

**Blues Notes:** *Madhuvā maññati* (thinks it sweet). Evil feels pleasurable before results manifest. The initial sweetness is deceptive; the fool doesn't see the bitterness coming.

---

### Verse 70: Fasting Without Understanding

**The Blues Truth:**

Month after month the fool may fast,  
Eat barely more than air—  
But he ain't worth a sixteenth part  
Of those who really understand there.

Starving body, empty mind,  
Discipline without the knowing—  
Count for nothing, count for nothing,  
All that pain with nowhere going.

**Blues Notes:** *Kusaggena* (with the tip of kusa grass) refers to extreme fasting. But *saṅkhātadhamma* (those who understand Dhamma) are worth sixteen times more. Asceticism without insight achieves nothing.

---

### Verse 71: Fire Under Ashes

**The Blues Truth:**

A wicked deed don't show right away,  
Like milk don't curdle fast.  
A wicked deed burns slow and hidden,  
Like fire under ash.

Smoldering, smoldering,  
Following the fool.  
Fire under ashes, fire under ashes—  
Burning like a hidden fuel.

Covered up but burning,  
Covered up but hot.  
That's your karma waiting, waiting—  
Ready or not.

**Blues Notes:** *Bhasmacchanno va pāvako* (fire covered with ashes). Karma's delayed action—evil seems dormant but is slowly ripening, quietly burning, waiting to consume. The fool doesn't see the smoke.

---

### Verse 72: Learning That Destroys

**The Blues Truth:**

A fool gains learning, gains learning,  
But it only does him harm.  
A fool gains learning, gains learning,  
Turns knowledge to a gun on his arm.

Destroys his good fortune,  
Destroys his very head.  
Learning in the wrong hands—  
Better ignorant instead.

**Blues Notes:** *Ñattaṁ* (learning) in wrong hands becomes destructive. Misused knowledge is worse than ignorance.

---

### Verses 73-74: The Fool's Ambitions

**The Blues Truth:**

"Let them respect me, respect me,  
Though I haven't earned it yet.  
Let them bow to me, bow to me,  
Let me be the one to get.

Control in the quarters,  
Worship from the crowd—  
'Everything was done by ME!'  
The fool thinks out loud."

Desires grow, conceit grows,  
While he plays the holy game.  
Desires grow, conceit grows—  
Foolishness dressed up in fame.

**Blues Notes:** Spiritual materialism exposed. *Icchā māno ca vaḍḍhati* (desires and conceit increase)—the opposite of genuine progress. Ambition wearing religious clothing.

---

### Verse 75: Two Different Roads

**The Blues Truth:**

The road to gains is one road.  
The road to Nibbāna's another.  
The road to gains is one road—  
They ain't even sisters or brothers.

Don't delight in honors, honors,  
Don't crave the clapping hands.  
Cultivate solitude, solitude—  
That's where freedom stands.

Two roads, two roads,  
Pointing different ways.  
Choose the one to freedom—  
Not the one that pays.

**Blues Notes:** *Lābhūpanisā* (means to gains) versus *Nibbānagāminī* (path to Nibbāna). Two entirely different directions. The Buddha's disciple chooses solitude over prestige.

---

## End of Chapter 5: Fools

**What We Learned:**

1. Long the night for the sleepless; longer the rebirths for fools
2. Better walk alone than with fools
3. Nothing is yours—not even you
4. Knowing you're a fool is the start of wisdom
5. Spoon never tastes curry; fool never learns Dhamma
6. You're your own worst enemy
7. Good deeds leave peace; bad deeds leave tears
8. Sweet now, bitter later—that's karma
9. Fasting without understanding = nothing
10. Karma smolders like fire under ashes
11. Learning can destroy the fool
12. Ambition dressed in robes is still just ambition
13. Two roads: gains and liberation. Choose.

Fool, fool—  
Don't be one.  
Learn from the teaching,  
Before day is done.

---

**Blues Notes on Translation Method:**

The Blues knows fools. Every blues song has one—usually the singer. But the Blues also knows the difference between being a fool and staying a fool. The Buddha's chapter isn't mocking fools; it's warning them. And the warning is: your worst enemy is in the mirror. Stop fighting yourself. Learn the taste of the curry. Let go of what was never yours.

---

# Chapter 6: Paṇḍitavagga - Blues Edition
## The Wise: Standing Like Rock, Deep Like a Lake

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

If Chapter 5 held up a mirror showing the fool, this chapter shows who you COULD be. The wise one. Not born wise—MADE wise through practice. Stands like rock when the wind blows. Calm like a deep lake. Sees criticism as treasure. Crosses to the other shore while everybody else runs along the bank.

---

### Verses 76-78: Choose Your People

**Verse 76**

**The Blues Truth:**

Someone shows you your faults?  
That's somebody showing you treasure.  
Someone shows you your faults?  
That's gold you couldn't find yourself.

Keep company, keep company  
With the one who reproves you.  
Better for you, not worse—  
That's what the wise one knew.

**Verse 77**

**The Blues Truth:**

Advise and instruct,  
Forbid what's wrong—  
The good will love you for it,  
The bad won't play along.

Good folks love correction.  
Bad folks hate it cold.  
That tells you something about people,  
And what kind of truth they'll hold.

**Verse 78**

**The Blues Truth:**

Don't walk with wicked friends,  
Don't walk with wicked friends.  
Don't keep company with the low ones—  
That's where your trouble begins.

Walk with spiritual friends,  
Walk with spiritual friends.  
Keep company with the noble—  
That's how your wisdom extends.

**Blues Notes:** *Kalyāṇamitta* (spiritual friend) is a technical Buddhist term. The Buddha said spiritual friendship is "the whole of the holy life." The fourfold structure (don't...don't...do...do) creates memorable rhythm for a crucial teaching.

### Verses 79-80: Drink Dhamma, Master Yourself

**Verse 79**

**The Blues Truth:**

Drink the Dhamma, drink the Dhamma,  
Live well with a clear mind.  
Drink the Dhamma, drink the Dhamma,  
Delight in what the Noble Ones designed.

Not just reading, not just hearing—  
Drinking down into your soul.  
The wise one drinks the teachings,  
And that Dhamma makes them whole.

**Verse 80**

**The Blues Truth:**

Course-makers lead the water.  
Fletchers straighten arrows.  
Carpenters straighten wood.  
The wise master themselves.

Water, arrow, wood—  
Each gets shaped by a hand.  
But YOU shape your own self,  
When you understand.

Master yourself, master yourself,  
That's the wise one's trade.  
Master yourself, master yourself—  
You're the work you've made.

**Blues Notes:** Three craftsmen metaphors lead to the climax: *attānaṁ damayanti paṇḍitā* (the wise master themselves). The self is the ultimate material requiring skillful shaping.

---

### Verses 81-82: Rock and Lake

**Verse 81**

**The Blues Truth:**

Solid rock, solid rock,  
Wind can't shake it none.  
Solid rock, solid rock,  
Stands when the storm is done.

Blame comes, praise comes—  
The wise don't move at all.  
Blame comes, praise comes—  
They don't rise, they don't fall.

**Verse 82**

**The Blues Truth:**

Deep lake, clear lake,  
Still water, no waves.  
Deep lake, clear lake—  
That's how the wise one saves.

After hearing Dhamma,  
After drinking truth,  
They settle deep and clear—  
Not stirred, not troubled, smooth.

Rock in the wind.  
Lake under sky.  
That's the wise one's mind—  
Unmoved, clarified.

**Blues Notes:** Two great images: *selo ekaghano* (solid rock) unmoved by *nindāpasaṁsā* (blame and praise); *rahado gambhīro* (deep lake) that becomes calm (*vippasīdanti*) after hearing Dhamma.

---

### Verse 83: Even in Pleasure, Even in Pain

**The Blues Truth:**

True people renounce, renounce,  
Wherever they may be.  
Good folks don't chatter about pleasure—  
They're working to be free.

Pleasure touches them?  
They don't fly up high.  
Suffering touches them?  
They don't fall down and cry.

No elation, no depression,  
No elation, no depression—  
Even ground in every weather,  
That's the wise one's session.

**Blues Notes:** *N'occāvacaṁ dassayanti* (show neither ups nor downs). Equanimity isn't suppression—it's deep stability. Pleasure and pain still come; the wise simply aren't thrown by them.

---

### Verse 84: Not for Self, Not for Other

**The Blues Truth:**

Not for myself, not for another,  
Not for child, riches, or throne—  
Don't seek what's wrong to own.

Don't want success through cheating,  
Don't want the crooked gain.  
Be virtuous, be wise, be righteous—  
That's the wise one's campaign.

**Blues Notes:** *Na attahetu na parassa hetu* (not for self, not for other) eliminates both selfishness AND misguided altruism. *Adhammena samiddhi* (success through corruption) is specifically rejected.

---

### Verses 85-86: Few Cross to the Other Shore

**The Blues Truth:**

Few people cross, few people cross,  
Most just run along the bank.  
Few people cross, few people cross,  
While the others break rank.

But those who live the Dhamma,  
Those who walk the well-taught way—  
THEY cross Death's hard river,  
THEY reach the other day.

Running on the bank, running on the bank—  
Busy but never arriving.  
Crossing to the shore, crossing to the shore—  
That's the wise one's thriving.

**Blues Notes:** *Pāragāmino* (those who go to the other shore) is liberation's classic image. Most people *tīram evānudhāvati* (just run along the bank)—lots of activity, never crossing.

---

### Verses 87-89: Letting Go to Shine

**Verse 87**

**The Blues Truth:**

Abandon the dark, develop the light.  
Leave home for homelessness.  
Find solitude, where delight is hard—  
That's the wise one's test.

**Verse 88**

**The Blues Truth:**

Learn to love that lonely place,  
Give up pleasures, own nothing.  
The wise one purifies the heart  
Of all its clinging.

**Verse 89**

**The Blues Truth:**

Those whose minds are well-developed  
In the factors of awakening—  
Who let go of grasping,  
Delighting in unattaching—

Pollutant-free, pollutant-free,  
Shining like the sun!  
Emancipated in this world—  
The wise one's work is done.

Shining forth, shining forth,  
No more taints to bind.  
Shining forth, shining forth—  
The liberated mind.

**Blues Notes:** *Khīṇāsavā jutimanto* (pollutant-free, shining forth). The āsavas (taints of sensuality, becoming, ignorance) are destroyed. *Parinibbutā* (emancipated in the world)—the final state of the wise.

---

## End of Chapter 6: The Wise

**What We Learned:**

1. Someone showing your faults = showing you treasure
2. The good love correction; the bad hate it
3. Walk with spiritual friends, not wicked ones
4. Drink Dhamma deep—don't just read it
5. Master yourself like craftsmen master their materials
6. Stand like rock, unmoved by praise or blame
7. Be deep like a lake, clear and still
8. Show neither elation nor depression
9. Don't seek success through corruption
10. Few cross the river; most run along the bank
11. Abandon the dark, develop the light
12. Purify the heart in solitary practice
13. The truly wise shine forth, pollutant-free, emancipated

Rock in the wind.  
Lake under sky.  
Crossing to the shore.  
Shining forth on high.

---

**Blues Notes on Translation Method:**

The wise one is the opposite of the fool—but that doesn't mean cold or distant. The wise one drinks Dhamma, keeps good company, stands firm in storms, and eventually shines forth like the sun. Every Blues singer who found their way out of suffering knows this path: stay steady, find true friends, do the inner work, and one day you shine.

# Chapter 7: Arahantavagga - Blues Edition
## The Arahants: Those Who Made It All the Way

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

This chapter's about the ones who MADE IT. The arahants—the perfected ones. No more craving, no more suffering, no more rebirth. They leave no track like birds in the sky. Stand unmoved like earth, like a city-post, like a clear lake. Even the gods are jealous. This is what the path leads to. This is why we practice.

---

### Verse 90: No More Fever

**The Blues Truth:**

Reached the goal, reached the goal,  
No more grief on any side.  
Reached the goal, reached the goal,  
All the knots untied.

No consuming fever,  
No burning in the chest.  
No consuming fever—  
This one is at rest.

**Blues Notes:** *Pariḷāho* (consuming fever, burning)—the inner torment of craving. When all the *gantha* (knots) are cut, the fever breaks forever.

---

### Verse 91: Geese Leaving the Lake

**The Blues Truth:**

Mindful ones keep striving,  
Don't cling to where they stay.  
Like geese who leave the lake behind,  
They fly on away.

Home after home, home after home,  
They leave it all behind.  
Home after home, home after home—  
Nothing holds their mind.

Like geese on the wing,  
Like geese on the wing,  
Moving on, moving on,  
No fondness for anything.

**Blues Notes:** *Haṁsā va pallalaṁ hitvā* (like geese abandoning a lake). Wild geese migrate without attachment to temporary waters. The arahat moves on, never clinging.

---

### Verses 92-93: No Tracks in the Sky

**The Blues Truth:**

No stores to guard, no stores to guard,  
Eating just what they need.  
Living in liberation,  
Empty, signless, freed.

Like birds in the sky,  
Like birds in the sky,  
Their track is hard to find.  
Like birds in the sky,  
Like birds in the sky,  
No footprints left behind.

Pollutants destroyed, pollutants destroyed,  
Not dependent on a thing.  
Flying through emptiness,  
No track for death to bring.

Birds leave no marks in the air.  
The perfected leave no path to trace.  
Māra searches everywhere—  
Can't find them anyplace.

**Blues Notes:** *Ākāse va sakuntānaṁ gati durannayā* (like birds in sky, their track is hard to find). The arahat lives in *suññato animitto vimokkho* (liberation that is empty and signless)—no trace for rebirth to follow.

---

### Verse 94: Even the Gods Are Jealous

**The Blues Truth:**

Senses stilled, senses stilled,  
Like horses trained just right.  
Senses stilled, senses stilled,  
Charioteer holding tight.

Conceit abandoned, pollutants gone—  
Even the gods look down and sigh.  
EVEN THE GODS are jealous of this one,  
Even the gods can't reach that high.

Gods have pleasure but they're still bound.  
This one is FREE.  
Gods will fall back down one day—  
This one won't be.

**Blues Notes:** *Devā pi pihayanti* (even gods envy). Remarkable: celestial beings, for all their pleasure, cannot match the arahat. Gods are still bound to rebirth; the arahat is truly free.

---

### Verse 95: Earth, Post, Lake

**The Blues Truth:**

Untroubled like the earth, like the earth—  
Pour anything on, it don't react.  
Untroubled like the earth, like the earth—  
Steady, solid, that's a fact.

Steadfast like a city-post, city-post—  
Driven deep, won't ever sway.  
Steadfast like a city-post, city-post—  
Standing there to stay.

Clear like a lake with no mud, no mud—  
Pure from bottom to top.  
Clear like a lake with no mud, no mud—  
Where birth and death stop.

Earth. Post. Lake.  
No more rounds to make.

**Blues Notes:** Three stability images: *paṭhavisamo* (like earth), *indakhīlūpama* (like city-post), *rahado apetakaddamo* (lake free from mud). *Saṁsārā na bhavanti*—samsara ends for such a one.

---

### Verse 96: Peace in Mind, Speech, and Action

**The Blues Truth:**

Calm in mind, calm in mind,  
Calm in speech, calm in deed.  
Calm in mind, calm in mind—  
Liberated, truly freed.

Through and through, through and through,  
Peace has filled every part.  
Through and through, through and through,  
In action, word, and heart.

**Blues Notes:** *Santaṁ manaṁ, santā vācā, santaṁ kammaṁ*—calm mind, calm speech, calm action. *Upasanta* (truly peaceful): peace has perfused every aspect of being.

---

### Verse 97: The Supreme Person

**The Blues Truth:**

Beyond mere faith—they KNOW.  
They know the unmade, the unconditioned ground.  
Cut off rebirth-linking,  
Destroyed the occasion, can't be found.

Thrown out hope, thrown out desire,  
Nothing left to chase.  
This one, THIS ONE,  
Is the supreme of the race.

Supreme person, supreme person—  
The highest we can be.  
Supreme person, supreme person—  
Utterly free.

**Blues Notes:** Five marks of the *uttamaporiso* (supreme person): beyond faith (direct knowledge), knows the unmade (nibbāna), cut the rebirth-link, destroyed occasion for becoming, ejected all craving.

---

### Verse 98: Wherever They Live Is Holy Ground

**The Blues Truth:**

Village or wilderness,  
Low ground or high—  
WHEREVER the arahants dwell,  
That ground is blessed thereby.

They don't need a special place.  
The place needs THEM.  
Wherever they sit down,  
That's where the light comes in.

**Blues Notes:** *Yattharahanto viharanti, taṁ bhūmiṁ rāmaṇeyyakaṁ* (wherever arahants live, that ground is delightful). The person blesses the place, not the other way around.

---

### Verse 99: Joy Where Others Can't Find It

**The Blues Truth:**

Delightful wilderness, delightful wilderness—  
But regular folks get bored.  
Nothing to chase, nothing to buy,  
Nothing that they're looking for.

But those without passion?  
They find the joy right there.  
Not seeking sense pleasure—  
They find joy EVERYWHERE.

What others flee from,  
They call home.  
What others can't stand,  
They never want to roam.

**Blues Notes:** *Vītarāgā ramissanti* (those without passion delight). The arahat, desiring nothing, can appreciate what IS. Their joy doesn't depend on getting something; it just IS.

---

## End of Chapter 7: The Arahants

**What We Learned:**

1. No more consuming fever—the goal is reached
2. Like geese leaving the lake—no clinging to home
3. Like birds in the sky—no track to find
4. Even the gods are jealous
5. Unmoved like earth, post, and clear lake
6. Calm in mind, speech, and action
7. The supreme person—beyond faith, knowing the unmade
8. Wherever they dwell is holy ground
9. They find joy where others find emptiness

Trackless in the sky.  
Unmoved on the ground.  
This is where the path leads—  
Where freedom is found.

---

**Blues Notes on Translation Method:**

The arahat is what we're all moving toward. Not cold detachment but complete freedom—the fever broken, the knots cut, the track impossible to trace. The Blues knows longing; the arahat knows fulfillment. The Blues knows suffering; the arahat knows peace. This chapter shows what's possible at the end of the road.

---

# Chapter 8: Sahassavagga - Blues Edition
## Thousands: One Truth Beats a Million Lies

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

A thousand empty words or one truth? A hundred years of wandering or one day of seeing? This chapter puts quantity against quality every single verse. Spoiler: quality wins every time. One word that brings peace beats a thousand that don't. One day seeing clear beats a hundred years blind.

---

### Verses 100-102: One Word of Truth

**The Blues Truth:**

A thousand sayings, thousand sayings  
Full of useless words—  
Better one word, ONE WORD,  
Hearing it you're brought to peace.

A thousand verses, thousand verses  
Full of empty sound—  
Better one line, ONE LINE,  
That's where peace is found.

Hundred verses, hundred verses  
Full of nothing real—  
Better one verse of Dhamma,  
Hearing it you heal.

One word of truth beats a thousand lies.  
One word of truth beats a thousand lies.  
Don't need the noise—  
Just need what's wise.

**Blues Notes:** *Anatthapadasaṁhitā* (consisting of useless/meaningless words). The criterion is *upasammati* (brought to peace). Quantity means nothing if the words don't pacify the mind.

---

### Verses 103-105: Conquer Yourself

**The Blues Truth:**

Conquer a thousand men, thousand men,  
A thousand times in war—  
But conquer your OWN self once,  
That's the victory you're living for.

Winning over yourself, over yourself,  
Better than winning over them.  
Winning over yourself, over yourself—  
That victory won't end.

Self-controlled, self-controlled,  
Living well-restrained—  
Neither gods nor demons,  
Not Māra, not Brahmā,  
Can undo what you've gained.

They can't turn victory to defeat,  
They can't turn victory to defeat,  
For the one who conquered SELF,  
That triumph is complete.

**Blues Notes:** *Saṅgāmajuttamo* (supreme in battle) redefines victory. External conquests can always be undone; self-conquest is permanent—even the gods can't reverse it.

---

### Verses 106-108: Worth More Than a Hundred Years

**The Blues Truth:**

Give a thousand coins, thousand coins,  
Every month for a hundred years—  
Worship someone truly awake  
For just ONE SECOND? That's what clears.

Tend the sacred fire, sacred fire,  
In the forest a hundred years—  
Honor someone truly developed  
For just ONE MOMENT? That's what steers.

All the sacrifices, all the giving,  
All year long seeking merit—  
Doesn't come to a quarter, not a quarter,  
Of honoring someone who's upright in spirit.

**Blues Notes:** *Bhāvitattāna* (one with developed self)—the worthy recipient. *Muhuttam-api* (even for a moment) of genuine worship surpasses a hundred years of undirected generosity.

---

### Verse 109: Four Things Increase

**The Blues Truth:**

Honor your elders, honor your elders,  
Worship the ones who've walked the way—  
Four things grow, four things grow:

Life grows longer.  
Beauty grows brighter.  
Happiness grows deeper.  
Strength grows stronger.

**Blues Notes:** *Āyu, vaṇṇa, sukha, bala* (life, beauty, happiness, strength). Practical benefits from spiritual practice.

---

### Verses 110-115: One Day vs. A Hundred Years

**The Blues Truth:**

Live a hundred years, hundred years,  
Without virtue, without calm—  
Better ONE DAY with virtue,  
One day with a meditating palm.

Live a hundred years, hundred years,  
Without wisdom, without peace—  
Better ONE DAY with wisdom,  
One day when ignorance cease.

Live a hundred years, hundred years,  
Lazy, weak, no drive—  
Better ONE DAY with energy,  
One day truly alive.

Live a hundred years, hundred years,  
Never seeing rise and fall—  
Better ONE DAY seeing impermanence,  
One day seeing it all.

Live a hundred years, hundred years,  
Never seeing the deathless way—  
Better ONE DAY seeing nibbāna,  
One day lights the gray.

Live a hundred years, hundred years,  
Never seeing supreme Dhamma true—  
Better ONE DAY seeing clearly,  
One day breaking through.

One day awake beats a hundred years asleep.  
One day awake beats a hundred years asleep.  
One day awake—  
That's the only thing to keep.

**Blues Notes:** Six parallel verses contrast *vassasataṁ jīve* (living a hundred years) with *ekāhaṁ jīvitaṁ* (one day's life). Criteria: virtue, wisdom, energy, seeing impermanence (*udayabbaya*), seeing the deathless, seeing supreme Dhamma. One day with any of these beats a century without.

---

## End of Chapter 8: Thousands

**What We Learned:**

1. One useful word beats a thousand useless ones
2. One verse of Dhamma beats a hundred empty ones
3. Conquering yourself beats conquering a million men
4. Self-victory can't be undone by gods or demons
5. A moment honoring the awake beats a hundred years of sacrifice
6. Worship the upright—it's worth more than all your giving
7. Honor your elders: life, beauty, happiness, strength increase
8. One day with virtue beats a hundred years without
9. One day with wisdom beats a hundred years blind
10. One day with energy beats a hundred years lazy
11. One day seeing impermanence beats a hundred years not seeing
12. One day seeing the deathless beats a hundred years missing it
13. One day seeing supreme Dhamma beats a hundred years of fog

One word of truth.  
One moment of seeing.  
One day of waking up.  
That's worth a thousand empties.

---

**Blues Notes on Translation Method:**

Every Blues singer knows: one line of truth cuts deeper than an hour of noise. The Buddha's teaching here matches the Blues aesthetic perfectly—strip away the padding, get to what matters. Quality over quantity. Depth over breadth. One moment seeing clear beats a lifetime in the dark.

---

# Chapter 9: Pāpavagga - Blues Edition
## Evil: Drop by Drop, the Pot Fills

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

Evil. Not some demon out there—it's what we DO that harms. And it accumulates. Drop by drop, the pot fills. Bit by bit, the karma builds. You can't outrun it. Can't hide in the sky, the sea, the mountain cave. This chapter tells it straight: hasten toward good, flee from evil, and know that every little thing counts.

---

### Verses 116-118: Hurry Toward Good

**The Blues Truth:**

Hurry toward the good, hurry toward the good,  
Keep the mind from wickedness.  
Slow to make merit? Slow to make merit?  
The mind slides toward the mess.

Do evil once? Don't do it again.  
Don't do it again, don't do it again.  
Don't set your heart there—  
Suffering piles up in the end.

Do good once? DO it again.  
Do it again, do it again.  
Set your heart there—  
Joy piles up. Amen.

**Blues Notes:** *Punappunaṁ* (again and again)—repetition builds momentum. Where you set your *chanda* (intention) matters. Evil accumulates suffering; merit accumulates joy.

---

### Verses 119-120: It Ripens When It Ripens

**The Blues Truth:**

The wicked may prosper, prosper  
While the evil hasn't ripened yet.  
But when that evil ripens, ripens,  
The wicked gets what the wicked gets.

The good may suffer, suffer  
While the good hasn't come through.  
But when the good fortune ripens,  
The good gets what's due.

Don't judge by today, by today.  
Karma ripens on its own time.  
Don't judge by today, by today—  
Wait for the fruit of the vine.

**Blues Notes:** *Paccati* (ripens)—karma matures like fruit. Current experience doesn't match current deeds because of time lag. But ripening is certain.

---

### Verses 121-122: Drop by Drop

**The Blues Truth:**

Don't dismiss evil thinking,  
"Won't touch me, won't touch me."  
Drop by drop, drop by drop,  
The water pot gets full.

The fool gathers, gathers,  
Bit by bit, becomes full of wrong.  
Drop by drop, drop by drop—  
That's how wickedness grows strong.

Don't dismiss merit thinking,  
"Won't reach me, won't reach me."  
Drop by drop, drop by drop,  
The water pot gets full.

The wise one gathers, gathers,  
Bit by bit, becomes full of right.  
Drop by drop, drop by drop—  
That's how goodness takes flight.

Little drops fill the pot.  
Little drops fill the pot.  
Every deed counts—  
Whether you think so or not.

**Blues Notes:** *Udabindunipātena udakumbho pūrati* (through falling drops the pot fills). Each drop seems nothing; together they fill the vessel. Never dismiss any action as too small to matter.

---

### Verses 123-124: Avoid the Poison

**The Blues Truth:**

Like a merchant on a dangerous road,  
Few friends, heavy load—  
Like someone who loves living  
Avoids the deadly sting—

Avoid evil, avoid evil,  
Like poison in your drink.  
Avoid evil, avoid evil—  
It's closer than you think.

BUT—

If no wound is in your hand,  
You can carry poison all day.  
Poison can't enter without a wound—  
Evil can't hurt the one who lives the right way.

**Blues Notes:** The wound metaphor: *nābbaṇaṁ visam-anveti* (poison doesn't enter without wound). If there's no opening for evil (no evil deed done), no bad result can enter.

---

### Verse 125: Dust Against the Wind

**The Blues Truth:**

Attack someone pure, someone harmless,  
Someone with no passion inside—  
That evil comes right back to you  
Like dust thrown against the tide.

Throw dust, throw dust against the wind—  
It blows right back in your face.  
Harm the harmless, hurt the pure—  
It returns to its starting place.

**Blues Notes:** *Sukhumo rajo paṭivātaṁ va khitto* (fine dust thrown against the wind). Attacking the pure backfires completely. The harm returns to the attacker.

---

### Verse 126: Where Do You End Up?

**The Blues Truth:**

Some come back as humans,  
Born again in a womb.  
Evildoers go down, go down,  
To the underworld's doom.

The righteous rise to heaven,  
The righteous rise up high.  
Those with no pollution left?  
They're free. They don't re-die.

Four roads, four roads,  
Depending how you live.  
Four roads, four roads—  
You choose which one you give.

**Blues Notes:** Four rebirth destinations: human womb, underworld (for evildoers), heaven (for righteous), *parinibbāna* (complete liberation for the pollutant-free).

---

### Verses 127-128: Nowhere to Hide

**The Blues Truth:**

Not in the sky, not in the sky,  
Not in the deep blue sea.  
Not in a mountain cave, mountain cave—  
There's nowhere you can flee.

No place on earth, no place on earth,  
Where you escape what you've done.  
No place on earth, no place on earth—  
Karma finds everyone.

Not in the sky, not in the sky,  
Not in the deep blue sea.  
Not in a mountain cave, mountain cave—  
Death finds you eventually.

No place on earth, no place on earth,  
Where death won't track you down.  
No place on earth, no place on earth—  
No hiding underground.

**Blues Notes:** Parallel verses: you can't hide from karma, you can't hide from death. *Antalikkhe, samuddamajjhe, pabbatānaṁ vivaraṁ*—sky, mid-ocean, mountain cleft. The universe has no hiding places.

---

## End of Chapter 9: Evil

**What We Learned:**

1. Hurry toward good, flee from evil
2. Don't repeat wickedness—suffering piles up
3. Repeat merit—joy piles up
4. Evil ripens in its own time; don't be fooled by temporary luck
5. Good ripens too; don't despair during hard times
6. Drop by drop fills the pot—every deed counts
7. Avoid evil like poison
8. Without the wound (evil deed), poison (bad result) can't enter
9. Harm the pure and it blows back in your face
10. Four destinations: human, hell, heaven, or freedom
11. Nowhere in sky, sea, or mountain can you hide from consequences
12. Death finds everyone, everywhere

Drop by drop.  
Bit by bit.  
Every little deed counts.  
That's the truth of it.

---

**Blues Notes on Translation Method:**

The Blues knows about consequences. Every Blues song is about what happens after—after the choice, after the deed, after the night. The Buddha's teaching here matches: you can't escape what you do. But the flip side is hope—drop by drop, merit fills the pot too. Every good deed counts. Every bit of kindness accumulates. Choose what drops you're adding.

---

# Chapter 10: Daṇḍavagga - Blues Edition
## Violence: The Rod That Returns

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

The rod. The stick. The fist. This chapter's about violence—and why it always comes back around. Everyone trembles at harm. Everyone loves their life. Feel that in yourself, and you'll stop hurting others. Be like a broken gong—struck but making no angry sound. That's the path to peace.

---

### Verses 129-130: Everyone Trembles

**The Blues Truth:**

Everyone trembles, trembles  
At the rod, at the stick.  
Everyone fears death, fears death—  
Nobody wants to be hit sick.

Compare yourself to others,  
Feel what THEY would feel.  
Then don't strike, don't have struck—  
That's the golden deal.

Everyone loves their life, their life,  
Everyone holds it dear.  
Knowing this, knowing this—  
Why would you bring them fear?

**Blues Notes:** *Attānaṁ upamaṁ katvā* (comparing oneself with others)—Buddhism's golden rule: feel how others feel, then act. *Na haneyya na ghātaye*—don't strike directly OR have someone strike for you.

---

### Verses 131-132: Harm Brings No Peace

**The Blues Truth:**

All beings want happiness, happiness,  
Just like you do too.  
Hurt them with the rod?  
No happiness comes to you.

After death, no peace—  
That's what the harmer gets.  
Seeking joy while causing pain?  
That's the worst of bets.

But don't harm with the rod,  
Don't hurt those who seek peace—  
After death, you find happiness,  
After death, release.

**Blues Notes:** *Sukhakāmā* (desiring happiness)—all beings share this. Harming them while seeking your own happiness is self-defeating.

---

### Verses 133-134: The Broken Gong

**The Blues Truth:**

Don't speak harsh, don't speak harsh—  
They might answer back.  
Arrogant talk brings misery,  
They might put you on the rack.

BUT—

If someone strikes you  
And you make no sound,  
Like a broken gong, a broken gong,  
Struck but silence all around—

You've reached Nibbāna, reached Nibbāna,  
No contention in your heart.  
Struck but silent, struck but peaceful—  
That's the wise one's art.

**Blues Notes:** *Kaṁso upahato* (broken gong) produces no sound when struck. The practitioner who doesn't resound with anger when attacked has eliminated contention. This is active peace, not suppression.

---

### Verse 135: Old Age and Death Drive Us

**The Blues Truth:**

Like a cowherd with a stick, with a stick,  
Drives cattle to pasture ground—  
Old age and death, old age and death,  
Drive us all around.

Inevitable, relentless,  
Moving us toward the end.  
Knowing this, knowing this—  
What harm would you extend?

**Blues Notes:** *Jarā ca maccu ca* (old age and death) drive all beings. This isn't fatalism—it's motivation. We're all headed the same way. Why hurt each other on the road?

---

### Verses 137-140: Ten Bad Returns

**The Blues Truth:**

Strike the harmless, hurt the pure?  
Ten bad things come your way:

Pain that's harsh,  
Loss of wealth,  
Body breaking down,  
Heavy sickness,  
Lose your mind,  
Kings bring you down,  
Slander terrible,  
Lose your kin,  
Possessions destroyed,  
Your house catches fire.

And when you die? The underworld.  
That's eleven for the price of violence.

Ten and one, ten and one—  
That's what violence brings.  
Strike the harmless, hurt the pure—  
Karma returns these things.

**Blues Notes:** Ten specific consequences for harming the harmless, plus rebirth in the underworld. The Buddha is very concrete here: violence has consequences in THIS life too.

---

### Verses 141-142: What Really Purifies

**The Blues Truth:**

Going naked won't purify you.  
Matted hair won't purify you.  
Mud and fasting won't purify you.  
Lying on rocks won't purify you.  
Dust and squatting won't purify you—  
If doubt is still in your heart.

BUT—

Even wearing fine clothes,  
If you're peaceful, trained, and true,  
Living the holy life,  
Laid down the rod toward ALL—

THAT'S a brahmin.  
THAT'S an ascetic.  
THAT'S a monastic.  
Not the costume—the conduct.

**Blues Notes:** External practices don't purify. *Nidhāya daṇḍaṁ sabbesu bhūtesu* (having laid down the rod toward all beings)—THAT makes you holy.

---

### Verses 143-145: Be Like the Good Horse

**The Blues Truth:**

Rare is the person, rare is the person,  
Restrained by conscience inside.  
Aware of their faults, aware of their faults,  
Like a good horse touched by the ride.

Be ardent, be intense,  
Like that good horse trained well.  
Faith, virtue, energy,  
Concentration—Dhamma you can tell.

Course-makers lead water.  
Fletchers straighten arrows.  
Carpenters straighten wood.  
The mild ones master themselves.

Master yourself, master yourself,  
Like the craftsman shapes the raw.  
Master yourself, master yourself—  
That's the highest law.

**Blues Notes:** The good horse needs only a light touch. Five qualities listed: *saddhā, sīla, viriya, samādhi, dhammavinicchaya* (faith, virtue, energy, concentration, Dhamma investigation). The craftsman metaphor returns: shape yourself.

---

## End of Chapter 10: Violence

**What We Learned:**

1. Everyone trembles at the rod—feel it, then don't strike
2. Everyone loves their life—respect that
3. Harm brings no happiness after death
4. Nonharm brings happiness after death
5. Harsh speech invites retaliation
6. Be like a broken gong—struck but silent
7. Old age and death drive us all—why add more pain?
8. Ten bad outcomes for harming the harmless
9. External practices don't purify if doubt remains
10. Laying down the rod toward all—THAT'S holiness
11. Be like a good horse, responsive to conscience
12. Master yourself like craftsmen shape their materials

Everyone trembles.  
Everyone fears.  
Knowing that—  
Why bring more tears?

---

**Blues Notes on Translation Method:**

The Blues knows violence. Every Blues singer has seen the rod—police batons, drunk fists, harsh words that cut deep. The Buddha's teaching here is direct: don't add to the pain. Be the broken gong that makes no angry sound when struck. That's not weakness—that's the strongest thing there is.

# Chapter 11: Jarāvagga - Blues Edition
## Old Age: The Housebuilder Has Been Seen

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

Old age. The body wearing down. Bones like dried gourds. But here's the treasure: the Buddha's ENLIGHTENMENT POEM is in this chapter. "O Housebuilder, now you are seen! You won't build this house again." That's the moment of liberation—craving exposed and defeated. This chapter holds both the hard truth of decay and the glorious truth of freedom.

---

### Verse 146: Why Are You Laughing?

**The Blues Truth:**

Why the laughter, why the laughter?  
Why the joy when the world's on fire?  
Wrapped in darkness, wrapped in darkness—  
Why don't you seek something higher?

The world burns, burns, burns  
With greed and hate and confusion.  
Enveloped in the dark—  
Why not seek the light's intrusion?

**Blues Notes:** *Niccaṁ pajjalite* (constantly burning)—the three fires of greed, hatred, delusion. *Padīpaṁ* (a light)—the Dhamma is that light.

---

### Verses 147-150: This Body Is Falling Apart

**The Blues Truth:**

See this beautified puppet, puppet,  
A heap of sores dressed up fine.  
Sick, imagined, nothing stable—  
Nothing in it's truly mine.

This body, this body—  
Worn out, nest of disease.  
The putrid thing breaks down, breaks down—  
Life ends without reprieve.

Like white gourds thrown in autumn,  
These grey bones scattered round.  
Seeing them, seeing them—  
Why delight in what's unwound?

This fortress made of bones, of bones,  
Plastered over with flesh and blood.  
But inside hides old age, hides death,  
Hides conceit and anger's flood.

**Blues Notes:** Four verses strip away glamour from the body. *Roganīḷa* (nest of disease), *pūtisandeho* (putrid mass), *aṭṭhīnaṁ nagara* (fortress of bones). Inner enemies hide within.

---

### Verses 151-152: What Lasts and What Doesn't

**The Blues Truth:**

Royal chariots decay, decay,  
Even the golden ones rust away.  
Bodies decay, bodies decay—  
Everything fades at the end of day.

BUT—

The Dhamma of the good doesn't fade,  
The Dhamma of the good stays true.  
The good pass it on to the good—  
That's the treasure that breaks through.

The person who doesn't learn, doesn't learn,  
Grows old like an ox in the field.  
Flesh gets bigger, wisdom stays small—  
Nothing real is revealed.

**Blues Notes:** *Satañ-ca Dhammo na jaraṁ upeti* (the Dhamma of the good doesn't decay). Bodies and chariots decay; truth passes on. The ox simile: *maṁsāni vaḍḍhanti, paññā na vaḍḍhati* (flesh increases, wisdom doesn't).

---

### Verses 153-154: The Housebuilder (The Buddha's Enlightenment Song)

**The Blues Truth:**

Through countless births, countless deaths,  
I wandered and I wandered.  
Seeking the housebuilder, seeking the one  
Who built this pain I've squandered.

Born again, suffering again,  
Round and round I roamed.  
Looking for the one who made this house,  
This prison I called home.

BUT NOW—

O HOUSEBUILDER, I SEE YOU NOW!  
You won't build this house again!  
All your rafters are BROKEN,  
The ridgepole's at its end!

My mind has reached the unconditioned,  
Craving's end has been achieved.  
You won't build this house again—  
I am FREED. I am FREED.

No more building, no more building,  
The house of birth and death.  
The Housebuilder's been seen, been seen—  
I breathe liberation's breath.

**Blues Notes:** The Buddha's first words after enlightenment. *Gahakāraka* (housebuilder) = *taṇhā* (craving) that constructs rebirth. *Phāsukā bhaggā* (rafters broken), *gahakūṭaṁ visaṅkhitaṁ* (ridgepole destroyed). *Visaṅkhāragataṁ cittaṁ* (mind reached the unconditioned). THIS IS THE LIBERATION SONG.

---

### Verses 155-156: Don't Waste Your Youth

**The Blues Truth:**

Didn't live the holy life,  
Didn't get wealth when young—  
Now they waste away, waste away,  
Like herons where no fish have swum.

Empty lake, empty lake,  
Nothing left to catch.  
Old and hungry, old and hungry—  
That's the wasted match.

Didn't live the holy life,  
Didn't get wealth when young—  
Now they lie like spent arrows,  
Wailing for what's done.

Shot and fallen, shot and fallen,  
Crying about the past.  
Too late, too late, too late—  
Youth didn't last.

**Blues Notes:** Two regrets: no spiritual accomplishment (*brahmacariya*) AND no worldly accomplishment (*dhana*). *Jiṇṇakoñcā* (old herons) in a fishless puddle. *Cāpātikhittā* (spent arrows). *Purāṇāni anutthunaṁ* (wailing about the past).

---

## End of Chapter 11: Old Age

**What We Learned:**

1. Why laugh when the world burns? Seek the light!
2. The body is a beautified puppet, a heap of sores
3. This fortress of bones hides death, conceit, and anger
4. Royal chariots decay, bodies decay—Dhamma doesn't
5. Don't grow old like an ox (more flesh, no more wisdom)
6. The HOUSEBUILDER HAS BEEN SEEN!
7. All the rafters are broken—no more rebirth
8. The end of craving has been achieved
9. Don't waste youth—or become a heron in a fishless lake
10. Don't become a spent arrow wailing about the past

The Housebuilder is seen.  
The ridgepole is down.  
No more building this house—  
Freedom has been found.

---

**Blues Notes on Translation Method:**

This chapter contains the Buddha's ENLIGHTENMENT POEM—the moment of liberation itself. The Blues knows about freedom songs, about breaking chains, about seeing the oppressor clearly for the first time. "O Housebuilder, I see you now!" is the ultimate freedom cry. Everything in this chapter builds toward that moment of seeing—and being free.

---

# Chapter 12: Attavagga - Blues Edition
## The Self: Nobody Can Purify You But You

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

The self. Your best friend or your worst enemy. By yourself is evil done, by yourself are you defiled. By yourself is evil left undone, by yourself are you purified. Nobody—not mama, not a preacher, not a savior—can clean you up. That's the Buddha's radical truth: you do it yourself or it doesn't get done.

---

### Verses 157-160: Guard Yourself, Train Yourself

**The Blues Truth:**

If you love yourself, love yourself,  
Guard yourself right well.  
Watch through the night, watch through the night—  
The wise one stays alert.

First get yourself right, get yourself right,  
THEN teach somebody else.  
Train yourself first, train yourself first—  
Then you got something to help.

Self is hard to train, hard to train,  
But do yourself what you teach.  
Be what you preach, be what you preach—  
That's how the teaching can reach.

The self is the friend of self, friend of self—  
What other friend you got?  
When you train yourself well, train yourself well,  
You find a friend worth a lot.

**Blues Notes:** *Attā hi attano nātho* (self is the friend/protector of self). No one can do the work for you. The trained self becomes your own best companion.

---

### Verses 161-162: Evil Crushes Itself

**The Blues Truth:**

Evil done by yourself, by yourself,  
Born in you, rising in you—  
Crushes the fool, crushes the fool,  
Like diamond crushing through.

Like a vine on a Sāl tree, Sāl tree,  
Strangling what holds it up—  
Covering yourself with lack of virtue  
Makes you your enemy's pup.

You become what your enemy wants,  
You become what your enemy wants,  
When you strangle yourself with wrong.

**Blues Notes:** *Attanā va kataṁ pāpaṁ* (evil done by oneself) crushes oneself—no external enemy needed. The *māluvā* (strangling vine) kills its host tree: self-destruction through unvirtue.

---

### Verses 163-165: No One Can Purify Another

**The Blues Truth:**

Easy to do what's no good, no good,  
Easy to do what harms you.  
What's beneficial, what's right, what's true?  
THAT'S the hard thing to pursue.

Revile the teaching, mock the Dhamma,  
Laugh at those who live it true—  
You bring destruction on yourself  
Like bamboo when it fruits through.

BUT HERE'S THE TRUTH, THE DEEPEST TRUTH:

By yourself is evil done, evil done.  
By yourself are you defiled.  
By yourself is evil NOT done, NOT done.  
By yourself are you purified.

Purity and impurity—  
They come from YOU alone.  
No one can purify another.  
NO ONE CAN PURIFY ANOTHER.  
This work is yours to own.

**Blues Notes:** *Suddhī asuddhī paccattaṁ, nāñño aññaṁ visodhaye* (purity and impurity are one's own; no one can purify another). Buddhism's most radical ethical statement. No savior can do it for you.

---

### Verse 166: Know Your Own Good

**The Blues Truth:**

Don't neglect your own good, your own good,  
For another's, however great.  
Know what's good for you, good for you,  
Be intent on that estate.

Take care of yourself first, yourself first,  
So you can help somebody else.  
Not selfish—just wise.  
First put on your own mask.

**Blues Notes:** *Atta-d-atthaṁ paratthena na hāpaye* (don't neglect your own good for another's). Not selfishness—recognizing that without self-cultivation, you can't help others.

---

## End of Chapter 12: The Self

**What We Learned:**

1. If you love yourself, guard yourself
2. Train yourself FIRST, then teach others
3. Self is the friend of self—what other friend is there?
4. Self-done evil crushes like a diamond
5. Lack of virtue is a strangling vine
6. Easy to do what's wrong; hard to do what's right
7. BY YOURSELF is evil done, by yourself defiled
8. BY YOURSELF is evil NOT done, by yourself purified
9. NO ONE CAN PURIFY ANOTHER
10. Know your own good and pursue it

By yourself is the work done.  
By yourself is the freedom won.  
Nobody else, nobody else—  
You do it or it doesn't get done.

---

**Blues Notes on Translation Method:**

The Blues knows about self-reliance. Nobody's coming to save you. You pick yourself up off the floor, you face your demons, you do the work. The Buddha's teaching here matches exactly: *nāñño aññaṁ visodhaye*—no one can purify another. That's not cold; that's empowering. The power is in YOUR hands.

---

# Chapter 13: Lokavagga - Blues Edition
## The World: Bubble, Mirage, Gilded Trap

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

The world. Beautiful like a king's chariot—and just as trapping. See it as a bubble. See it as a mirage. The fools get depressed when it fails them; the wise see through it and aren't bound. And here's the kicker: stream-entry—just the FIRST step on the path—is worth more than ruling the whole world.

---

### Verses 167-169: Live by Dhamma

**The Blues Truth:**

Don't follow lowly things, lowly things,  
Don't live heedlessly.  
Don't follow wrong views, wrong views—  
Don't foster worldly ways.

Strive, don't slack, don't slack,  
Live by Dhamma, live right.  
Those who live by Dhamma, Dhamma,  
Rest easy day and night.

This world and the next, next,  
Both at ease, both at peace.  
Live by Dhamma, live by Dhamma—  
That's where suffering cease.

---

### Verses 170-171: Bubble, Mirage, Gilded Chariot

**The Blues Truth:**

See it as a bubble, bubble,  
See it as a mirage.  
Look at the world that way, that way—  
Death's king can't find your passage.

Come, look at this world, this world,  
Gilded like a royal ride.  
Beautiful, shining, attractive—  
But fools get depressed inside.

No bond for those who understand, understand.  
No bond for those who see.  
See through the gilded chariot—  
And you are FREE.

**Blues Notes:** *Bubbuḷaka* (bubble), *marīcikā* (mirage), *rājarathūpama* (king's chariot)—all beautiful, all empty. *Natthi saṅgo vijānataṁ*—no bond for those who understand.

---

### Verses 172-173: Moon Breaking Through

**The Blues Truth:**

Was heedless before, heedless before,  
But now you've woken up—  
You shine on this world, shine on this world,  
Like the moon when clouds break up.

Did wicked deeds before, before,  
But now you cover them with good—  
You shine on this world, shine on this world,  
Like the moon released from its hood.

The cloud can't destroy the moon, the moon,  
It only hides it for a while.  
Your luminous nature remains, remains—  
It's waiting to shine and smile.

**Blues Notes:** *Abbhā mutto va candimā* (moon released from cloud). Past heedlessness or past evil can be overcome. The cloud obscures but doesn't destroy the moon.

---

### Verses 174-175: Few Escape

**The Blues Truth:**

This world is blind, blind, blind,  
Few here really see.  
Few go up to heaven—  
Like birds that break free from the net.

Geese fly the sun's path, sun's path,  
High through the sky they roam.  
The wise are led out of the world  
After beating Māra and his throne.

Few escape, few escape,  
Most stay bound in the net.  
But those who defeat the tempter—  
They reach where freedom's set.

**Blues Notes:** *Andhabhūto ayaṁ loko* (this world is blind). *Sakunto jālamutto va* (like birds escaping the net)—few achieve liberation.

---

### Verses 176-177: The Liar and the Miser

**The Blues Truth:**

Speak falsely, lie and lie—  
Once truth is gone, all wickedness follows.  
Abandon the next world for this one?  
The future turns hollow.

The miserly don't reach heaven, reach heaven.  
Fools don't praise giving.  
But the wise rejoice in generosity—  
THAT'S the art of living.

Give freely, give freely,  
And happiness follows behind.  
Give freely, give freely—  
That's peace of the generous kind.

---

### Verse 178: Better Than World Sovereignty

**The Blues Truth:**

Rule the whole earth, the WHOLE earth—  
Or go to heaven above—  
Or be lord of all the worlds, all worlds—  
BETTER is the first taste of freedom's love.

Stream-entry, stream-entry,  
Just the first step on the way—  
Worth more than ruling everything,  
Worth more than all the world's display.

One step on the path, the path,  
One glimpse of what's true—  
Worth more than being king of everything.  
That first step changes you.

**Blues Notes:** *Sotāpattiphalaṁ varaṁ* (stream-entry is better). Stream-entry is just the FIRST stage of enlightenment—and it's already worth more than maximum worldly success.

---

## End of Chapter 13: The World

**What We Learned:**

1. Don't follow lowly things or wrong views
2. Live by Dhamma—rest easy in both worlds
3. See the world as bubble, as mirage
4. The gilded chariot binds fools; the wise see through
5. Past heedlessness can be overcome—moon breaks through clouds
6. Past evil covered by good—you can shine again
7. This world is blind; few escape the net
8. The wise defeat Māra and fly free
9. Lying opens the door to all wickedness
10. Miserliness blocks heaven; generosity opens it
11. STREAM-ENTRY IS BETTER THAN WORLD SOVEREIGNTY

See it as a bubble.  
See it as a mirage.  
See through the gilded world—  
And you won't be in its cage.

---

**Blues Notes on Translation Method:**

The Blues knows illusion. Every singer who chased fame and fortune and found it empty knows about the gilded chariot. The Buddha's teaching hits: it's beautiful, it's shining, and it's a TRAP. But you can break through like the moon through clouds. You can escape like a bird from the net. And that first step on the real path? Worth more than owning everything.

---

# Chapter 14: Buddhavagga - Blues Edition
## The Buddha: Pathless, Trackless, Supreme

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

The Buddha. The awakened one. Victory that can't be undone, range that's endless, path that can't be traced. This chapter gives us the teaching in three lines: don't do evil, do good, purify your mind. That's the whole thing. And the three refuges—not in mountains or trees, but in Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha. THAT'S where freedom lives.

---

### Verses 179-180: The Pathless One

**The Blues Truth:**

His victory can't be undone, undone,  
Nobody in the world comes close.  
The Buddha, endless in his range—  
The pathless one, beyond reproach.

By what path can you lead him?  
By what path can you lead him?  
No craving leads him anywhere—  
By what path can you lead him?

Trackless, trackless,  
Like birds in the sky.  
No way to follow him back—  
He's already too high.

**Blues Notes:** *Apada* (pathless, without track)—the Buddha leaves no trace. *Kena padena nessatha* (by what path can you lead?)—the liberated one cannot be led by desire.

---

### Verses 181-182: Four Rare Things

**The Blues Truth:**

Even the gods are jealous, jealous,  
Of those who meditate and know.  
Even the gods look down with envy  
On the fully awakened ones below.

FOUR RARE THINGS, FOUR RARE THINGS:

Rare to be born human.  
Rare this mortal life.  
Rare to hear the True Dhamma.  
Rare when a Buddha arrives.

Rare, rare, rare, rare—  
Don't waste what you've got.  
This opportunity is precious—  
Most beings don't get this shot.

**Blues Notes:** *Kiccha* (rare)—human birth, mortal life, hearing Dhamma, Buddha's arising. We've already won the lottery; don't waste the ticket.

---

### Verse 183: The Teaching of ALL Buddhas

**The Blues Truth:**

DON'T DO EVIL.  
DO WHAT'S GOOD.  
PURIFY YOUR MIND.

That's it.  
That's the teaching.  
That's what every Buddha said.

Don't do evil, do what's good,  
Purify your mind, your mind.  
Simple to say, lifetime to do—  
That's the teaching you'll find.

**Blues Notes:** *Sabbapāpassa akaraṇaṁ, kusalassa upasampadā, sacittapariyodapanaṁ*—the famous three-part summary. This is IT. Everything else is commentary.

---

### Verses 184-185: Non-Harm and Practice

**The Blues Truth:**

Patience is the supreme austerity, austerity.  
Nibbāna is supreme, say the Buddhas.  
Those gone forth don't hurt another—  
Ascetics don't harass.

Not finding fault.  
Not hurting.  
Restrained by discipline.  
Knowing the right measure of food.  
Living remote.  
Devoted to meditation.

THAT'S the teaching of the Buddhas.

---

### Verses 186-187: No Satisfaction in Pleasure

**The Blues Truth:**

Rain down coins, rain down coins—  
Satisfaction won't be found.  
Sense pleasures have little joy  
And much suffering around.

Even heavenly pleasures, heavenly pleasures,  
Don't satisfy the wise.  
The Buddha's disciple delights  
In craving's final demise.

Not in getting more, more, more—  
In ENDING the wanting.  
That's where joy is, that's where peace is—  
In craving's end, not craving's haunting.

---

### Verses 188-192: The Three Refuges

**The Blues Truth:**

Shaken by fear, shaken by fear,  
People run to the mountains.  
Run to the forest, run to tree shrines—  
Looking for safety in fountains.

BUT—

That's not a safe refuge, safe refuge.  
That's not the refuge supreme.  
Coming to THAT won't free you—  
Won't end the suffering stream.

Whoever takes refuge in BUDDHA,  
Whoever takes refuge in DHAMMA,  
Whoever takes refuge in SANGHA,  
And sees the Four Noble Truths:

Suffering.  
The arising of suffering.  
The overcoming of suffering.  
The Eightfold Path that stills.

THAT is a safe refuge, safe refuge.  
THAT is the refuge supreme.  
Coming to THAT liberates—  
Frees you from every suffering stream.

Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha.  
Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha.  
THAT'S where freedom lives.

**Blues Notes:** Mountains and forests don't liberate; Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha do. But refuge includes *seeing with right wisdom* the Four Noble Truths—not just faith, but understanding.

---

### Verses 193-196: The Buddha's Arising Is Good

**The Blues Truth:**

A noble person is rare, rare,  
Not born everywhere.  
Wherever they're born, that family  
Gets happiness to share.

Good is the arising of Buddhas.  
Good is the teaching of truth.  
Good is the harmony of Sangha.  
Good is the devotion of youth.

Those who worship the awakened,  
Those who honor the free—  
Their merit is beyond measure,  
Beyond what eyes can see.

---

## End of Chapter 14: The Buddha

**What We Learned:**

1. The Buddha's victory can't be undone
2. He's pathless—you can't lead him by desire
3. Even gods envy the awakened
4. Four rare things: human birth, life, Dhamma, Buddha
5. THE TEACHING: Don't do evil, do good, purify your mind
6. Patience is supreme austerity
7. Nibbāna is supreme, say the Buddhas
8. No rain of coins satisfies craving
9. Mountains and forests aren't safe refuge
10. BUDDHA, DHAMMA, SANGHA—that's the refuge
11. See the Four Noble Truths with wisdom
12. Good is the Buddha's arising, Dhamma's teaching, Sangha's harmony

Don't do evil.  
Do what's good.  
Purify your mind.  
That's the word.

---

**Blues Notes on Translation Method:**

This chapter is the heart of Buddhism. The three refuges, the four rare things, the teaching summary. Every Blues singer looking for solid ground should look here: not in mountains or trees, but in Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha. And the teaching? Three lines. Don't do evil. Do good. Purify your mind. That's all of it. That's the whole thing.

## Happiness: The Real Kind

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

What's real happiness? Not winning—the victor breeds hatred. Not possessions—we'll feed on joy like divine beings. Not longing—live without craving among the cravers. Peace is supreme happiness. Contentment is supreme wealth. Nibbāna is the supreme good. This chapter tells you what REAL happiness tastes like.

---

### Verses 197-200: Let Us Live Happily

**The Blues Truth:**

Let us live happily, happily,  
Without hate among the haters.  
Let us live happily, happily—  
Free while they're in chains.

Let us live happily, happily,  
Without sickness among the sick.  
Let us live happily, happily—  
While others feel affliction's prick.

Let us live happily, happily,  
Without longing among the longers.  
Let us live happily, happily—  
Free from wanting's hunger.

We live happily, happily,  
We who have nothing to own.  
We feed on joy, pure joy—  
Like gods of light have shown.

**Blues Notes:** *Susukhaṁ vata jīvāma* (we live truly happily) refrain. *Ābhassarā* gods feed on joy alone—that's the practitioner's model.

---

### Verses 201-204: Peace Is Supreme

**The Blues Truth:**

The victor breeds hatred, hatred.  
The loser finds pain.  
But the one AT PEACE lives happily,  
Dropped the whole victory game.

No fire like passion, passion.  
No offense like hate.  
No suffering like the aggregates—  
No happiness beyond peace's gate.

Hunger is the supreme sickness.  
Conditioned life is supreme pain.  
Know this, really know it—  
NIBBĀNA is the supreme gain.

Health is supreme gain.  
Contentment is supreme wealth.  
Trust is supreme kinship.  
Nibbāna is supreme health.

**Blues Notes:** *Natthi santiparaṁ sukhaṁ* (no happiness beyond peace). That's the core. Lists of supremes: health, contentment, trust, Nibbāna.

---

### Verses 205-208: Taste of Dhamma, Company of the Wise

**The Blues Truth:**

Taste the solitude, taste the peace—  
Become fearless, become clean.  
Drink the taste of Dhamma—  
Sweetest thing you've ever seen.

Meet the noble—that's good.  
Live with them—that's pleasant always.  
Don't meet fools—that's happy.  
That's the wise one's ways.

Consort with fools? Grieve long.  
Dwell with fools? Suffer like with foes.  
But dwell with the wise? Happy—  
Like family, and everybody knows.

So follow the firm, the wise, the learned,  
The virtuous, dutiful, true—  
Like the moon follows the stars through the sky,  
That's what the wise ones do.

---

## End of Chapter 15: Happiness

**What We Learned:**

1. Live happily among the hateful—without hate
2. Live happily among the sick—without sickness
3. Live happily among cravers—without craving
4. Feed on joy like the gods of light
5. Victory breeds hatred; peace is happiness
6. No fire like passion, no offense like hate
7. No suffering like conditioned existence
8. Nibbāna is supreme happiness
9. Health is supreme gain; contentment is supreme wealth
10. Taste solitude, taste peace, drink Dhamma
11. Meet the noble, avoid fools
12. Follow the wise like moon follows stars

No happiness beyond peace.  
No happiness beyond peace.  
Drop the winning and losing—  
Find where suffering cease.

# Chapter 16: Piyavagga - Blues Edition
## What Is Dear: The Root of Grief and Fear

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

Love. The sweetest thing—and the sharpest knife. From love comes grief. From love comes fear. This chapter traces the root: love, fondness, delight, desire, craving—all lead to the same place. But the one who lets go? No grief. No fear. How could there be?

---

### Verses 209-211: Don't Cling

**The Blues Truth:**

Grasping what you love, grasping what you love,  
Leaving what's good behind—  
You'll end up envying those  
Who worked on their own mind.

Don't hold the loved ones too tight, too tight.  
Don't cling to enemies either.  
Not seeing the loved brings pain;  
Seeing the hated—same grievance fever.

So hold nothing as dear, as dear.  
Because losing what's loved is pain.  
No bonds exist for those  
Who've dropped the loved/unloved game.

**Blues Notes:** *Ganthā tesaṁ na vijjanti* (no knots for those) who transcend both loved and unloved. Attachment guarantees eventual suffering.

---

### Verses 212-216: Five Roots of Grief and Fear

**The Blues Truth:**

From LOVE comes grief, from LOVE comes fear.  
Free from love? No grief. How could there be fear?

From FONDNESS comes grief, from FONDNESS comes fear.  
Free from fondness? No grief. How could there be fear?

From DELIGHT comes grief, from DELIGHT comes fear.  
Free from delight? No grief. How could there be fear?

From DESIRE comes grief, from DESIRE comes fear.  
Free from desire? No grief. How could there be fear?

From CRAVING comes grief, from CRAVING comes fear.  
Free from craving? No grief. HOW COULD THERE BE FEAR?

Love, fondness, delight, desire, craving—  
Five names for the same root.  
Cut the root, cut the root,  
And grief and fear go moot.

**Blues Notes:** Five parallel verses, identical structure. *Piya, pema, rati, kāma, taṇhā*—love, fondness, delight, desire, craving. All produce *soka* (grief) and *bhaya* (fear). Freedom from any of them = freedom from both.

---

### Verses 217-220: True Love Is Different

**The Blues Truth:**

One with virtue and insight,  
Principled, knowing truth,  
Doing their proper work—  
THAT one the people love for proof.

One going upstream, upstream,  
Mind touched by awakening—  
Unattached to pleasure's stream,  
That's a different kind of thing.

When someone long gone comes home safe,  
Family rejoices at the door.  
Just so, when a merit-maker dies,  
Merit welcomes them—and more.

Like family at the gate, the gate,  
Merit receives your soul.  
The good you've done becomes your kin  
When you cross to the final goal.

---

## End of Chapter 16: What Is Dear

**What We Learned:**

1. Grasping the loved while leaving the good = envy
2. Pain comes from not seeing loved; pain comes from seeing unloved
3. Hold nothing as dear—losing what's loved is painful
4. From LOVE comes grief and fear
5. From FONDNESS comes grief and fear
6. From DELIGHT comes grief and fear
7. From DESIRE comes grief and fear
8. From CRAVING comes grief and fear
9. Free from these = no grief, no fear
10. True admiration goes to the virtuous
11. Merit welcomes you home like family

From love comes grief.  
From love comes fear.  
Let go of the grasping—  
And you're finally clear.

# Chapter 17: Kodhavagga - Blues Edition
## Anger: Hold Back the Swerving Chariot

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

Anger. Swerving like a runaway chariot. Only the one who holds it back is the real driver—everyone else is just holding reins. This chapter gives the antidotes: overcome anger with non-anger, bad with good, stinginess with giving, lies with truth. And remember: nobody in the world escapes blame. Don't even try.

---

### Verses 221-223: The Charioteer

**The Blues Truth:**

Abandon anger, abandon conceit,  
Get past every chain.  
Don't cling to mind and body—  
And suffering won't remain.

Anger rises like a swerving chariot, chariot,  
Running off the road.  
Hold it back, hold it back—  
THAT'S the charioteer's code.

Others just hold the reins, the reins.  
They're along for the ride.  
But the one who CONTROLS the anger?  
THAT'S the one with real pride.

Overcome anger with NON-anger.  
Overcome bad with GOOD.  
Overcome stinginess with GIVING.  
Overcome lies with TRUTH.

**Blues Notes:** *Rathaṁ bhantaṁ va dhāraye* (like controlling a swerving chariot). Four antidotes: non-anger, goodness, giving, truth.

---

### Verses 224-226: Truth, No Anger, Give

**The Blues Truth:**

Speak truth. Don't get angry.  
Give when asked—even a little.  
These three things, these three things,  
Take you to the divine threshold.

Sages without violence,  
Restrained in body, always—  
They go to the deathless state,  
Gone there, they never grieve again.

Always wakeful, always wakeful,  
Training day and night.  
Intent on Nibbāna, Nibbāna—  
The pollutants lose their might.

---

### Verses 227-230: Nobody Escapes Blame

**The Blues Truth:**

This is OLD, Atula—not just today:  
People blame the quiet one.  
People blame the talker.  
People blame the moderate too.  
NOBODY in the world escapes being undone.

Never was, never will be,  
Nobody found yet—  
Totally blameworthy or totally praiseworthy.  
Don't hold your breath.

BUT—

One the wise examine and praise,  
Faultless, sagacious, wise—  
Like a gold coin of finest quality,  
Who's worthy to criticize?

The gods praise that one.  
Brahmā himself praises that one.  
Don't seek everyone's approval—  
Seek the praise of the WISE ONE.

**Blues Notes:** *Natthi loke anindito* (no one in the world is unblamed). Famous teaching to Atula. Don't chase universal approval—it doesn't exist.

---

### Verses 231-234: Three Gates

**The Blues Truth:**

Guard against anger in the BODY.  
Be restrained with the flesh.  
Drop the wrong; do the right.  
In body, be your best.

Guard against anger in SPEECH.  
Be restrained with the tongue.  
Drop the wrong; do the right.  
Watch what words are sung.

Guard against anger in MIND.  
Be restrained in thought.  
Drop the wrong; do the right.  
In mind, let anger rot.

Body, speech, and mind—  
Restrained in all three gates.  
The wise are FULLY restrained.  
That's the liberated state.

---

## End of Chapter 17: Anger

**What We Learned:**

1. Abandon anger, abandon conceit
2. Be the charioteer—hold back the swerving anger
3. Overcome anger with non-anger
4. Overcome bad with good, stinginess with giving, lies with truth
5. Speak truth, don't get angry, give even a little
6. Nobody in the world escapes blame
7. Don't seek universal approval—it doesn't exist
8. Seek the praise of the wise and the gods
9. Guard against anger in body, speech, and mind
10. The fully restrained are wise

Hold back the swerving chariot.  
Don't just hold the reins.  
Be the CHARIOTEER of anger—  
That's how freedom remains.

# Chapter 18: Malavagga - Blues Edition
## Impurity: Rust Eats the Iron It Comes From

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

Stains. Rust. Impurity. This chapter's central teaching: rust comes from iron and eats the iron it came from. Your own unwholesome deeds destroy YOU. But there's hope: the silversmith removes stains gradually, little by little. Make your island. Become wise. Ignorance is the supreme stain—abandon it.

---

### Verses 235-239: Withered Leaf, Make Your Island

**The Blues Truth:**

You're like a withered leaf now, withered leaf,  
Yama's messengers are at the door.  
Standing at decay's gate, decay's gate—  
With no provisions for what's in store.

MAKE YOUR ISLAND, make your island!  
Quickly strive, become wise.  
Remove the stain, become blemishless—  
Then to the divine realm you'll rise.

You're advanced in age now, advanced in age,  
Come to Yama's very presence.  
Nowhere to dwell in between—  
No provisions for the journey hence.

MAKE YOUR ISLAND, make your island!  
Quickly strive, become wise.  
Remove the stain, become blemishless—  
No more birth, no more age to arise.

The sage removes stains gradually,  
Little by little, moment by moment—  
Like a silversmith polishing silver,  
Pure from the patient atonement.

**Blues Notes:** *Dīpam-attano* (island for oneself). *Yamapurisā* (Yama's messengers). Silversmith metaphor: patient, gradual purification.

---

### Verses 240-243: Rust Eats the Iron

**The Blues Truth:**

Rust comes from iron, from iron,  
Then eats the iron it came from.  
Your own deeds work the same way—  
They'll take you where the bad ones come.

Stain of mantras: not repeating.  
Stain of houses: not maintaining.  
Stain of beauty: being lazy.  
Stain of the guard: not remaining.

Bad conduct stains. Stinginess stains.  
Wicked deeds are stains everywhere—  
This world and the next, the next.

BUT—

Worse than all those stains:  
IGNORANCE is the supreme stain.  
Abandon that one, abandon that one—  
Be stainless. That's the aim.

---

### Verses 244-248: Easy Life, Hard Life

**The Blues Truth:**

Life is EASY for the shameless, shameless,  
Bold as a crow, no care.  
Backbiting, reckless, defiled within—  
Life is light without awareness there.

But life is HARD for one with shame, with shame,  
Constantly seeking pure.  
Sincere, not reckless, looking for the clean—  
That path requires more.

Who kills, who lies, who steals, who cheats,  
Who goes to another's spouse,  
Who drinks and drinks without restraint—  
DIGS UP HIS OWN ROOT in this house.

Know this, friend: lack of restraint is bad.  
Don't let greed and corruption  
Oppress you with suffering long—  
That's the way of self-destruction.

---

### Verses 251-255: Four Dangers, No Footprint

**The Blues Truth:**

No fire like PASSION.  
No grip like HATRED.  
No snare like DELUSION.  
No flood like CRAVING.

Easy to see others' faults, others' faults.  
Your own? Hard to find.  
You sift their faults like chaff, like chaff,  
But hide your own behind like a crafty cheat.

Who looks for others' faults all day, all day,  
A constant complainer—  
The pollutants grow in that one;  
Liberation gets no nearer.

No footprint in the sky.  
No ascetic on the outside.  
Folk love their impediments;  
Buddhas are free inside.

No footprint in the sky.  
No conditions last forever.  
No disturbance for the Buddhas—  
They've cut the final tether.

---

## End of Chapter 18: Impurity

**What We Learned:**

1. You're like a withered leaf—Yama's messengers are waiting
2. MAKE YOUR ISLAND for yourself
3. The silversmith removes stains gradually
4. Rust comes from iron and eats the iron
5. Ignorance is the SUPREME stain
6. Life is easy for the shameless; hard for the shame-aware
7. Breaking the precepts digs up your own root
8. No fire like passion, no grip like hatred, no snare like delusion, no flood like craving
9. Easy to see others' faults; hard to see your own
10. Looking for others' faults increases your pollutants
11. No footprint in the sky—Buddhas leave no trace

Rust eats the iron it came from.  
Your deeds consume YOU.  
Polish yourself like silver—  
Little by little, come through.

# Chapter 19: Dhammaṭṭhavagga - Blues Edition
## The Just: Not by X Are You Y

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

Not by talking much are you wise. Not by grey hair are you an elder. Not by shaved head are you an ascetic. This chapter strips away external markers and asks: what are you REALLY? The answer is always in the practice, not the appearance.

---

### Verses 256-259: Talking Much Means Nothing

**The Blues Truth:**

Rush to settle a case? That's not Dhamma.  
The wise one weighs both sides,  
Settles without haste, justly, fair—  
THAT'S where Dhamma resides.

Talk a lot? That doesn't make you wise.  
Safe, hatred-free, fearless—  
THAT'S what makes a wise one rise.

Speak much Dhamma? That doesn't make you a bearer.  
But hear a little and SEE it in yourself?  
THAT makes you a Dhamma-carer.

**Blues Notes:** *Bahu bhāsati* (speaking much) doesn't make wisdom. *Dhammaṁ kāyena passati* (sees Dhamma in the body)—direct experience matters.

---

### Verses 260-265: Not by Grey Hair

**The Blues Truth:**

Not by GREY HAIR are you an elder, elder.  
Just aged? That's old in vain.  
But with truth, Dhamma, non-violence,  
Restraint and training—THAT'S the elder's domain.

Not by ELOQUENCE or BEAUTY are you honorable.  
Still jealous, selfish, deceitful inside?  
Cut that out at the root—  
THEN you're honorable, nothing to hide.

Not by SHAVED HEAD are you an ascetic, ascetic.  
Lacking vows, speaking lies, full of greed?  
Pacify wicked deeds, small and great—  
THAT'S the ascetic's creed.

---

### Verses 266-272: True Monastics, True Seers

**The Blues Truth:**

Not by eating almsfood are you a monastic.  
Ward off merit AND demerit,  
Walk with discrimination—  
THAT'S what makes you fit.

Not by SILENCE is a fool a seer.  
Hold the balance, take what's noble—  
The seer rejects wicked deeds,  
Understands both worlds, stays stable.

Not by HURTING living beings are you noble.  
Not hurt ANY breathing thing—  
THAT'S what makes you noble.

Not by virtue, vows, learning,  
Concentration, secluded space—  
DO I achieve renunciation's joy.  
Don't be confident, don't lose the race—  
Until the pollutants are DESTROYED.

---

## End of Chapter 19: The Just

**What We Learned:**

1. Not by hastily settling cases do you stand by Dhamma
2. Not by speaking much are you wise
3. Not by speaking much are you a Dhamma-bearer
4. Not by grey hair are you an elder
5. Not by eloquence or beauty are you honorable
6. Not by shaved head are you an ascetic
7. Not by eating almsfood are you a monastic
8. Not by silence is a fool a seer
9. Not by hurting beings are you noble
10. Don't be confident until pollutants are destroyed

Not by the costume.  
Not by the title.  
Not by the talk.  
What you DO is vital.

# Chapter 20: Maggavagga - Blues Edition
## The Path: There Is No Other

### Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening Words

THE PATH. The Eightfold Path is best. There is no other path for insight and purity. Enter it or stay lost. This chapter has the Three Marks of Existence—impermanence, suffering, non-self—and the urgent warning: death comes like a flood on a sleeping village. No children, no father, no kin can save you. Walk the path NOW.

---

### Verses 273-276: This Is THE Path

**The Blues Truth:**

Eightfold Path is best, is best.  
Four Truths are best of all.  
Passionlessness is the best state.  
The Buddha's the best who stands tall.

THIS is the path, THIS is the path—  
There is no other way.  
Enter this path for insight and purity—  
This confounds Māra's sway.

Enter this path, you'll end suffering.  
I declared this path to you.  
Remove the dart with knowledge—  
That's what the awakened do.

Your duty is ARDOR, ardor.  
The Buddhas just point the way.  
Meditators who walk this path  
Break free from Māra's play.

**Blues Notes:** *Eso va maggo natthañño* (THIS is the path, no other). *Tumhehi kiccaṁ ātappaṁ* (your duty is ardor). The Buddha points; YOU walk.

---

### Verses 277-279: The Three Marks

**The Blues Truth:**

All conditions are IMPERMANENT.  
See this with wisdom, and you'll be free.  
Grow tired of suffering, tired of suffering—  
This is the path to purity.

All conditions are SUFFERING.  
See this with wisdom, and you'll be free.  
Grow tired of suffering, tired of suffering—  
This is the path to purity.

All dhammas are WITHOUT SELF.  
See this with wisdom, and you'll be free.  
Grow tired of suffering, tired of suffering—  
This is the path to purity.

Impermanent. Suffering. No-self.  
Three marks, three marks, three marks—  
See any one deeply, and you'll walk  
Out of the suffering's arcs.

---

### Verses 280-285: Cut the Forest, Not Just the Tree

**The Blues Truth:**

The lazy one—young, strong, but sluggish,  
Mind lacking right intent—  
Does NOT find wisdom's path, wisdom's path.  
All that energy misspent.

Guard your speech, restrain your mind,  
Don't do wrong with the body.  
Three paths of action to purify—  
That's the path shown by the godly.

From effort wisdom rises;  
Without effort wisdom dies.  
Know these two paths of growth and decline—  
Set yourself where wisdom flies.

Cut the FOREST, not just a tree!  
The forest is where danger hides.  
Cut the forest AND the thicket—  
Be without where craving resides.

As long as ANY desire for another  
Holds even an atom's weight,  
The mind stays bound, stays bound—  
Like a calf to mother's milk estate.

Cut off self-affection, self-affection!  
Like plucking an autumn lotus clean.  
Develop the path to peace, to peace—  
Nibbāna that the Buddha has seen.

---

### Verses 286-289: Death Comes Like a Flood

**The Blues Truth:**

"I'll stay here for the rains,  
Here for winter and summer too"—  
So thinks the fool, the fool,  
Not seeing danger breaking through.

The one attached to children, cattle,  
Mind besotted and caught—  
Snatched by death, snatched by death,  
Like a sleeping village death has brought.

Children can't save you.  
Father can't save you.  
Kin can't save you.  
When the End-Maker comes for you.

Knowing this, knowing this—  
The wise one, endowed with virtue,  
Should QUICKLY purify the path,  
The path to Nibbāna, the path that's true.

---

## End of Chapter 20: The Path

**What We Learned:**

1. The Eightfold Path is best of paths
2. THIS is the path—there is no other
3. Your duty is ARDOR; Buddhas only point
4. All conditions are IMPERMANENT
5. All conditions are SUFFERING
6. All dhammas are WITHOUT SELF
7. The lazy one doesn't find wisdom's path
8. From effort wisdom rises; without effort it dies
9. Cut the FOREST of defilements, not just a tree
10. Death comes like a flood on a sleeping village
11. Children, father, kin can't save you
12. QUICKLY purify the path to Nibbāna

This is THE path.  
There is no other.  
Walk it NOW—  
Or be swept like the flood takes another.

---

# Chapter 21: Pakiṇṇakavagga - Blues Edition
## Miscellaneous: Collected Jewels from the Road

---

## Opening Words

This chapter's called Miscellaneous, but don't let that fool you. These are COLLECTED JEWELS—the teachings that didn't fit neatly into other boxes but are too precious to leave out. Think of it like the wise old man's pockets: whatever he pulls out is something you need right now.

---

### Verse 290: Trade Up, Not Down

**The Blues Truth:**

If you gotta give up something small  
To get something large,  
Baby, make that trade.  
A wise one sees the big picture—  
Renounce the little good  
For the greater good ahead.

Don't clutch pennies when dollars are waiting.  
Don't hoard crumbs when the feast is set.  
The wise one knows when to let go  
Of what's holding them back.

**Blues Notes:** *Mattāsukhapariccāgā*—renouncing a small pleasure. This ain't about deprivation. It's about WISDOM. You give up the candy to get the meal. You give up the instant gratification for the lasting peace.

---

### Verse 291: Can't Build Happiness on Someone Else's Pain

**The Blues Truth:**

You want happiness for yourself  
By making someone else suffer?  
Listen here, friend—  
That's building your house on quicksand.

You get tangled up with hatred that way,  
And hatred don't let go easy.  
You think you're winning,  
But you're just binding yourself tighter  
To the very thing you hate.

Can't be free from hatred  
While still dealing in hatred's business.  
That's just math, baby.

**Blues Notes:** *Verasaṁsaggasaṁsaṭṭho*—associated with hatred. Buddha's saying cause and effect is RELENTLESS. Hurt others to help yourself, and you stay bound to that hurt.

---

### Verses 292-293: What Needs Doing vs. What Doesn't

**The Blues Truth:**

Here's how the pollutants GROW:  
You leave undone what needs doing,  
And do what doesn't need doing.  
Insolent. Heedless. Proud.  
Your spiritual pollution just keeps rising like floodwaters.

But here's how the pollutants DIE:  
Mindfulness of the body—keep it going.  
Don't practice what shouldn't be practiced.  
Persist in what SHOULD be done.  
Mindful. Fully aware.  
The pollutants settle down like mud in still water.

That's the choice every day, every hour—  
What am I feeding?  
The peace or the poison?

**Blues Notes:** *Āsavā* are the deep pollutants—things like sensual craving, craving for existence, and ignorance. They INCREASE with heedlessness and DECREASE with mindfulness. Simple equation, hard practice.

---

### Verses 294-295: The Riddle of Destroying Mother and Father

**The Blues Truth:**

Now this one sounds WILD—  
"Destroying mother and father,  
Two noble kings,  
A kingdom and its followers—  
The brahmin proceeds untroubled."

What?! The Buddha telling us to kill folks?  
NAH, baby. Listen deeper.

MOTHER is craving.  
FATHER is conceit.  
The TWO KINGS are eternalism and annihilationism—  
Wrong views on both sides.  
The KINGDOM is the sense-bases with their objects.  
The FOLLOWER is delight in attachment.

Destroy THOSE, and you walk free—  
Untroubled, unburdened, awake.

The second verse adds "a tiger as the fifth"—  
That's the five hindrances:  
Desire, ill-will, sloth, restlessness, doubt.  
Cut them down!

**Blues Notes:** This is classic Buddhist encryption—outrageous statements that reveal profound meaning when decoded. The Buddha wasn't advocating violence; he was using shock value to wake people up.

---

### Verses 296-301: The Six Recollections—Awake Well

**The Blues Truth:**

Gotama's disciples AWAKE WELL.  
What does that mean?  
Day and night, they keep mindfulness of:

**THE BUDDHA—**  
Remembering the Awakened One,  
His qualities, his path, his victory.  
That's verse 296.

**THE DHAMMA—**  
Remembering the Teaching,  
Visible here and now, inviting investigation,  
Leading onward for the wise.  
That's verse 297.

**THE SANGHA—**  
Remembering the Community,  
Practicing well, worthy of respect,  
Field of merit for the world.  
That's verse 298.

**THE BODY—**  
Remembering this body,  
Breath by breath, step by step,  
Knowing what's happening right now.  
That's verse 299.

**NON-VIOLENCE—**  
Delighting in harmlessness,  
At peace with all beings,  
No wish to hurt.  
That's verse 300.

**CULTIVATION—**  
Delighting in development,  
Growing the wholesome,  
Tending the garden of the mind.  
That's verse 301.

Six doors to waking well.  
Use them all, use them daily.  
THAT'S what Gotama's disciples do.

**Blues Notes:** *Suppabuddhaṁ pabujjhanti*—they awake to a good awakening. The Buddha is teaching HOW to wake up right. These six recollections are practical tools, not just devotional sentiments.

### Verse 302: Hard Either Way—Choose Your Hard

**The Blues Truth:**

Listen, going forth is HARD.  
Finding delight in renunciation? HARD.  
But living in households? ALSO HARD.  
Suffering alongside people different from you? HARD.  
Being a traveler in this round of births? HARD.  
Being affected by suffering? HARD.

So here's the thing—  
Life is hard either way.  
You gonna suffer at home,  
You gonna struggle on the path.

But one leads to freedom,  
And one keeps you spinning.

So don't be a traveler forever.  
Don't keep getting affected by suffering.  
CHOOSE the hard that leads somewhere.

**Blues Notes:** *Dukkhānupatitaddhagū*—travelers affected by suffering. The Buddha's not promising an easy road, but he IS pointing to the road that ends.

---

### Verse 303: The Faithful One Shines Everywhere

**The Blues Truth:**

You got faith?  
You got virtue?  
You got wealth and a good name?

Then wherever you go, baby,  
WHEREVER you go—  
You're honored right there and then.

This ain't about popularity.  
This is about INTEGRITY.  
When you're really walking the walk,  
People recognize it.  
It shines through.

**Blues Notes:** *Tattha tattheva pūjito*—right there and then he is worshipped. The Buddha's describing the natural magnetism of genuine virtue.

---

### Verse 304: The Good Shine Like Mountains

**The Blues Truth:**

THE GOOD shine from far away—  
Like the Himalayas covered in snow.  
You can see 'em from miles off.  
That brilliance can't be hidden.

But the WICKED?  
They're invisible here—  
Like arrows shot in the night.  
You don't see 'em till they hit.

So ask yourself:  
Am I a snow-capped mountain?  
Or an arrow in the dark?

**Blues Notes:** *Himavanto va pabbato*—like a snow-covered mountain. Himalaya literally means "abode of snow." The comparison is striking: goodness is VISIBLE, wickedness hides.

---

### Verse 305: The Solitary One at the Forest's Edge

**The Blues Truth:**

Sitting alone.  
Lying down alone.  
Walking alone.  
DILIGENT.

The solitary one who trains oneself—  
Ah, that one will find delight  
At the forest's edge.

Not lonely—ALONE.  
There's a difference.  
Lonely is empty.  
Alone is FULL.

The one who's really working on themselves,  
They don't need the crowd.  
They find peace in the quiet,  
Joy in the practice,  
Liberation in the solitude.

**Blues Notes:** *Vanante ramito siyā*—will delight in the edge of a forest. The "forest's edge" is both literal (a place for meditation) and metaphorical (the boundary between the conditioned world and Nibbāna).

---

## End of Chapter 21: Miscellaneous

**What We Learned:**

1. Trade small pleasures for greater good
2. Can't build happiness on others' suffering
3. Leave undone what shouldn't be done; persist in what should
4. "Mother and father" means craving and conceit—destroy THOSE
5. Six Recollections: Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha, Body, Non-violence, Cultivation
6. Life is hard either way—choose the hard that leads to freedom
7. The faithful, virtuous one is honored everywhere
8. The good shine like snow-capped mountains from afar
9. The wicked are invisible like arrows shot in darkness
10. The solitary, diligent one finds joy at the forest's edge

These are the collected jewels.  
Miscellaneous, maybe.  
But every one of them GOLD.

🙏

# Chapter 22: Nirayavagga - Blues Edition
## Hell: The Underworld Awaits the Unwary

---

## Opening Words

This chapter's about HELL. Not as a place outside you, but as the destination you CREATE through your actions. The Buddha's not trying to scare you—he's trying to WAKE you up. Every action has consequences. Some consequences take you down, down, down. Better to know that NOW than find out later.

---

### Verse 306: Liars Go to Hell

**The Blues Truth:**

The one who speaks FALSELY—  
Who says what isn't so—  
Goes to the underworld.

And the one who says "I didn't do it"  
When he DID?  
Same destination, friend.

Both of them, when they pass on,  
End up in the same place—  
The hereafter that receives  
Those who did base deeds.

Lying about truth,  
Lying about your actions—  
Both roads lead DOWN.

**Blues Notes:** *Abhūtavādī* means speaking what is untrue. *Nirayaṁ* is the underworld, the hell realm. The Buddha equates these two types of lying because both corrupt truth.

---

### Verse 307: The Robe Doesn't Save You

**The Blues Truth:**

MANY wear the monastic robe  
Around their necks—  
But they're wicked inside.  
Unrestrained. Living foul.

You think that cloth protects you?  
You think that title saves you?

Through wicked deeds,  
The wicked re-arise  
In the underworld.

The robe is just CLOTH,  
If the heart is still poison.

**Blues Notes:** *Kāsāvakaṇṭhā*—wearing the robe around the neck. This is a direct warning to monastics, but it applies to anyone who thinks religious garb or titles protect them from their own actions.

---

### Verse 308: Better to Eat a Glowing Iron Ball

**The Blues Truth:**

LISTEN—  
It's BETTER to swallow  
A glowing iron ball,  
Hot as fire's flame,

Than to enjoy the almsfood of the land  
Without virtue,  
Without restraint.

You hear that?  
A burning metal ball in your belly  
Is BETTER than living off others' generosity  
While being a hypocrite.

That's how serious this is.  
Don't play at holiness  
While acting foul inside.

**Blues Notes:** *Ayoguḷo bhutto tatto*—having eaten a glowing iron ball. This shocking image drives home the point: false holiness is worse than physical torture. The karmic consequences are THAT severe.

---

### Verses 309-310: The Four Results of Adultery

**The Blues Truth:**

You heedless man,  
Chasing after someone else's partner—  
Here's what you get.  
FOUR states waiting:

ONE: Demerit.  
Bad karma stacking up.

TWO: An uncomfortable bed.  
No peace when you lie down.

THREE: Blame.  
People know. They talk.

FOUR: The underworld.  
Where you end up reborn.

And what did you get?  
Only the small, fearful pleasure  
Of a scared man with a scared woman.  
Kings apply heavy punishment.  
Society condemns you.

Was it worth it?  
A man should NOT consort  
With another's wife.

**Blues Notes:** *Paradārūpasevī*—one who consorts with another's wife. The Buddha lists the practical AND karmic consequences. This isn't moralizing—it's cause and effect.

---

### Verses 311-313: The Ascetic Life Wrongly Grasped

**The Blues Truth:**

KUSHA GRASS—  
You know the jagged kind?  
Grab it wrong, and it CUTS your hand.  
Blood everywhere.

The ascetic life is the same.  
Grab it wrong,  
Practice it wrong,  
And it DRAGS you down to hell.

A lax deed?  
A defiled vow?  
A holy life that's doubtful?  
NAH—that ain't bearing great fruit.

If you're gonna do this thing,  
DO IT RIGHT.  
Be FIRM in your effort.  
The wanderer who's lax  
Just spreads impurity everywhere.

Don't be that guy.  
Either practice properly  
Or don't pretend at all.

**Blues Notes:** *Kuso yathā duggahito*—like kusha grass wrongly grasped. The image is vivid: spiritual practice is like a sharp blade. Handle it right, it cuts through delusion. Handle it wrong, it cuts YOU.

---

### Verse 314: Better Undone is a Wrong-Doing

**The Blues Truth:**

Here's wisdom in two lines:

**BETTER UNDONE is a wrong-doing—**  
'Cause that wrong-doing is gonna BURN you later.  
You'll regret it. You'll suffer.  
Leave it undone.

**BETTER DONE is what's well-done—**  
'Cause that good deed brings no regret.  
You did right, and it sits right.  
Do that instead.

Simple calculus, baby.  
Wrong → regret.  
Right → no regret.  
Make your choice.

**Blues Notes:** *Akataṁ dukkataṁ seyyo*—better undone is wrong-doing. *Katañ-ca sukataṁ seyyo*—better done is well-doing. The Buddha's giving you a decision framework for every action.

---

### Verse 315: Guard Yourself Like a Border Town

**The Blues Truth:**

You know how they guard a border town?  
INSIDE and OUTSIDE.  
Watching every approach.  
Nothing gets past without notice.

That's how you should watch over YOURSELF.  
Guard the gates of your senses.  
Watch what comes in.  
Watch what goes out.

And don't let the MOMENT pass—  
Don't let the chance slip by.  
'Cause when the chance is gone,  
They GRIEVE.  
Consigned to the underworld,  
They grieve.

This moment is IT.  
Right here.  
Guard it like your life depends on it.  
Because it does.

**Blues Notes:** *Nagaraṁ yathā paccantaṁ*—like a border town. *Khaṇo vo mā upaccagā*—don't let the moment pass you by. Urgency combined with vigilance.

---

### Verses 316-318: Wrong Views Lead to Bad Destiny

**The Blues Truth:**

Here's how you end up in a bad place:

**ASHAMED of what's not shameful,  
NOT ashamed of what IS shameful—**  
Wrong views. Bad destiny.

**SEEING FEAR in what's not fearful,  
NOT SEEING FEAR in what IS fearful—**  
Wrong views. Bad destiny.

**FINDING BLAME in what's blameless,  
NOT SEEING BLAME in what IS blameable—**  
Wrong views. Bad destiny.

Three ways to get it backwards.  
Three ways to walk into hell  
With your eyes wide open.

Your VIEW determines your destination.  
Get the view wrong,  
And you'll get lost  
In all the wrong places.

**Blues Notes:** *Micchādiṭṭhisamādānā*—undertaking wrong views. This phrase repeats three times, emphasizing that VIEW is foundational. Wrong view doesn't just affect philosophy—it determines where you end up.

---

### Verse 319: Right Views Lead to Good Destiny

**The Blues Truth:**

But HERE'S how to go RIGHT:

**KNOWING blame in what's blameable,**  
**And NO blame in what's blameless—**

Right views.  
Good destiny.

That's it.  
See clearly what deserves criticism.  
See clearly what doesn't.  
Don't get it twisted.

Undertake RIGHT views,  
And beings go to a GOOD destiny.

Same principle—  
Just turned around.  
View makes the path.  
Path makes the destination.

**Blues Notes:** *Sammādiṭṭhisamādānā*—undertaking right views. This is the flip side. The whole chapter builds to this: it's not about fear of hell, it's about CLARITY of view.

---

## End of Chapter 22: Hell

**What We Learned:**

1. Liars—whether about facts or about their own actions—go to hell
2. The robe doesn't save you if your heart is wicked
3. Better to eat a glowing iron ball than enjoy almsfood without virtue
4. Adultery brings: demerit, no peace, blame, and hell
5. The ascetic life wrongly grasped drags you DOWN
6. Be firm in effort—lax practice spreads impurity
7. Better UNDONE is a wrong-doing; better DONE is a right-doing
8. Guard yourself like a border town—inside and outside
9. Don't let the moment pass—or grieve in hell later
10. Wrong views (about shame, fear, blame) → bad destiny
11. Right views (seeing clearly) → good destiny

This ain't about scaring you.  
It's about WAKING you up.  
Consequences are REAL.  
View determines destination.

Choose wisely.

🙏

# Chapter 23: Nāgavagga - Blues Edition
## The Elephant: Noble in Strength, Noble in Training

---

## Opening Words

The elephant was the mightiest animal in ancient India—patient, powerful, wise. The Buddha loved this image. He called himself "the elephant" in his final days. This chapter teaches you to BE the elephant: endure abuse like an arrow in battle, train yourself like the royal tusker, and when no good companion can be found—walk alone through the forest like the solitary bull.

---

### Verses 320-321: Endure Abuse Like an Elephant in Battle

**The Blues Truth:**

Like an ELEPHANT in battle  
Endures an arrow shot from the bow—  
That's how I will endure abuse.

Why?  
Because many people are unvirtuous.  
That's just how it is.  
They're gonna talk.  
They're gonna hate.  
They're gonna shoot their arrows.

But the TRAINED one—  
That's who they lead into crowds.  
That's who kings mount.  
The trained one is BEST among humans—  
The one who can endure.

Arrows of words flying?  
Stand like the elephant.  
Let them fall.  
Keep moving.

**Blues Notes:** *Nāgo va saṅgāme*—like an elephant in battle. War elephants were trained to endure arrows without panic. The Buddha's saying: train your mind to endure abuse the same way.

---

### Verses 322-323: Self-Training Is the Noblest

**The Blues Truth:**

Noble are the well-trained horses.  
Noble are the well-bred steeds from Sindh.  
Noble are the great tusker elephants.

But MORE noble than all of these?  
The one who has TRAINED THEMSELVES.

You can't ride a horse to Nibbāna.  
You can't travel by elephant  
To the place beyond all destinations.

But through training YOURSELF well—  
Being trained by the training—  
THAT'S how you get there.

No vehicle takes you.  
Only the trained mind arrives.

**Blues Notes:** *Attadanto tato varaṁ*—more noble is the self-trained. The Buddha's comparing the HIGHEST achievements in animal training to self-training—and saying self-training wins.

---

### Verse 324: Dhanapālaka Remembers the Forest

**The Blues Truth:**

There was a tusker named DHANAPĀLAKA—  
"Guardian of Wealth."  
Captured, musty in rut,  
Difficult to restrain.

They bound him up.  
Gave him food.  
But he wouldn't eat a MORSEL.

Why?

He remembered the elephant forest.  
He remembered where he came from.  
He remembered FREEDOM.

That's what kept him going—  
The memory of the wild,  
The longing for home.

Do YOU remember where freedom lives?  
Do YOU remember what you're really after?  
Let that memory sustain you,  
Even when you're bound.

**Blues Notes:** *Sumarati nāgavanassa kuñjaro*—the tusker remembers the elephant forest. This is a teaching story about not forgetting your true home—Nibbāna—even when caught in the bonds of worldly life.

---

### Verse 325: Don't Be the Pig

**The Blues Truth:**

When you're TORPID—  
When you overeat—  
When you're sleepy, rolling around in bed—

You're like a great PIG  
Fed on fodder.  
Stuffed and stupid.

And that fool?  
That dull, lazy fool?  
Comes to the WOMB again.  
Rebirth after rebirth.

Is that what you want?  
To be born again  
'Cause you couldn't stay awake?

Wake UP.  
Stop eating like a pig.  
Stop sleeping your life away.

**Blues Notes:** *Mahāvarāho va nivāpapuṭṭho*—like a great pig fed on fodder. The contrast with the noble elephant is sharp: the elephant remembers freedom; the pig just eats and sleeps into rebirth.

---

### Verse 326: Control the Mind Like an Elephant with a Goad

**The Blues Truth:**

BEFORE—  
This wandering mind wandered everywhere.  
Through desire. Through pleasure. Through whatever it wanted.  
It went where IT wanted to go.

But TODAY—  
I will control it WISELY.  
Like the one with a GOAD  
Controls an elephant in rut.

That elephant is wild.  
Dangerous. Unpredictable.  
But with skill and a goad,  
You can direct it.

Same with your mind.  
It's been running wild.  
Time to take the goad in hand.

**Blues Notes:** *Hatthim-pabhinnaṁ viya aṅkusaggaho*—like one with goad (controls) an elephant in rut. The aṅkusa is the elephant goad. This verse is about the TURNING point when you decide to train your mind.

---

### Verse 327: Raise Yourself from the Pit

**The Blues Truth:**

Delight in HEEDFULNESS.  
Protect your MIND.  
ALWAYS.

You're stuck in a pit right now—  
Like a tusker sunk in the mud.  
Struggling. Stuck.

But even the elephant can pull itself free.  
It RAISES itself from the muck.

You can too.  
Pull yourself up.  
Out of the pit.  
Out of the swamp.  
Into freedom.

**Blues Notes:** *Paṅke sanno va kuñjaro*—like a tusker sunk in the mud. Elephants actually do get stuck in swamps, and they have to heave themselves out with massive effort. That's YOUR job with your mind.

---

### Verses 328-330: On Friendship and Solitude

**The Blues Truth:**

IF you find a PRUDENT friend—  
One who lives well, who's wise—  
STAY with that one.  
Walk together.  
Overcome your troubles together.  
Be glad. Be mindful.

BUT—  
If you DON'T find such a friend?  
If no one lives well around you?

Then be like a KING  
Who abandons his conquered kingdom.  
Walk ALONE.  
Like a solitary elephant in the forest.

BETTER to live alone  
Than be friends with a fool.  
Live alone. Do nothing bad.  
Unconcerned. Free.  
Like the bull elephant  
Who needs no herd.

It's better to walk alone  
Than walk wrong with company.

**Blues Notes:** *Eko care mātaṅgaraññe va nāgo*—one should live alone like a solitary elephant in the forest. This repeats twice—the Buddha MEANT it. Bad company isn't worth having.

---

### Verse 331: What Is Good

**The Blues Truth:**

Friends are GOOD when need arises.  
Being content with whatever? GOOD.  
Merit at the end of life? GOOD.  
Abandoning all suffering? GOOD.

That's the list.  
Four goods:  
Friends when needed.  
Contentment always.  
Merit at death.  
The end of suffering.

Simple. Clear.  
What's on YOUR list?

---

### Verse 332: Respecting Elders and Teachers

**The Blues Truth:**

RESPECTING your mother is good in this world.  
RESPECTING your father is good in this world.  
RESPECTING ascetics is good in this world.  
RESPECTING true brahmins is good in this world.

Honor those who came before.  
Honor those who teach.  
Honor those who walked the path.

This isn't weakness—  
This is WISDOM.

---

### Verse 333: What's Good Till Old Age

**The Blues Truth:**

VIRTUOUS CONDUCT till old age is good.  
Stay steady your whole life—that's gold.

FAITH well-established is good.  
Root yourself in what's true.

The ACQUISITION of wisdom is good.  
Keep learning, keep growing.

Doing NOTHING wicked is good.  
The simplest teaching, the hardest practice.

Four more goods:  
Virtue all the way through.  
Faith planted deep.  
Wisdom gathered.  
No wickedness done.

That's how you live  
Like an elephant—  
Noble from beginning to end.

**Blues Notes:** *Sukhaṁ yāva jarā sīlaṁ*—virtuous conduct till old age. This is the closing teaching of the chapter: sustain your practice until the very end.

---

## End of Chapter 23: The Elephant

**What We Learned:**

1. Endure abuse like an elephant endures arrows in battle
2. The trained one is best among humans
3. Self-training is nobler than any trained animal
4. You can't ride a vehicle to Nibbāna—only the trained mind arrives
5. Remember the "elephant forest"—your true home of freedom
6. Don't be the pig: torpid, overeating, sleepy
7. Control the wild mind like an elephant with a goad
8. Raise yourself from the mud-pit of suffering
9. If you find a wise friend, walk together gladly
10. If no wise friend, walk ALONE like the solitary elephant
11. Better alone than with fools
12. Respect mother, father, teachers, and the awakened
13. Keep virtue till old age; gather wisdom; do no wickedness

Be the ELEPHANT—  
Noble. Patient. Trained.  
Walking alone when necessary,  
Enduring what must be endured,  
Never forgetting where freedom lives.

🙏

# Chapter 24: Taṇhāvagga - Blues Edition
## Craving: The Root That Keeps Growing Back

---

## Opening Words

This is THE chapter on craving. *Taṇhā*—that thirst, that hunger, that relentless wanting. The Buddha said craving is the cause of suffering. Cut the root, and the tree can't grow back. But leave even a scrap of root in the ground, and it'll sprout again. Twenty-six verses on the most important thing to understand: what binds you, and how to get free.

---

### Verses 334-335: Craving Grows Like a Creeper

**The Blues Truth:**

For a human who lives HEEDLESSLY,  
Craving grows like a clinging vine—  
That *māluvā* creeper  
That wraps around and chokes trees.

He rushes from HERE to THERE,  
Like a monkey swinging through the forest,  
Looking for fruit, looking for fruit,  
Never satisfied.

And when this LOW craving,  
This attachment to the world,  
Overcomes you?  
Your GRIEFS increase—  
Like grass after heavy rain,  
Growing wild and thick.

**Blues Notes:** *Taṇhā vaḍḍhati māluvā viya*—craving grows like the māluvā creeper. This vine literally strangles the host tree. Perfect metaphor.

---

### Verse 336: Overcome Craving, and Grief Falls Away

**The Blues Truth:**

But WHOEVER overcomes  
This low craving—  
Difficult as it is to get past—

Griefs FALL from them  
Like a drop of water  
Off a lotus leaf.

Doesn't stick.  
Doesn't soak in.  
Just rolls right off.

That's what freedom looks like.  
Griefs can't get purchase  
When craving's been cut.

---

### Verse 337: Dig Up the Root

**The Blues Truth:**

This I say to you—  
All of you gathered here:  
GOOD LUCK.

Now DIG UP the root of craving.  
Like a man seeking the fragrant *usīra* root  
Digs up the grass to get to it—  
DIG.

Don't let Māra push you down  
Again and again,  
Like a stream pushes down a reed.  
Stand FIRM.  
Get to the ROOT.

**Blues Notes:** *Taṇhāya mūlaṁ khaṇatha*—dig up craving's root. The *usīra* (vetiver) root is fragrant and valuable. You dig through the grass to get it. Same with liberation—dig through the craving to get to freedom.

---

### Verse 338: The Root That Grows Back

**The Blues Truth:**

You can cut the tree down,  
But if the ROOT stays firm,  
Untroubled,  
It grows AGAIN.

Same with craving.  
When the TENDENCY to craving  
Isn't rooted out,  
This suffering appears  
Again and again and again.

The tree is your behavior.  
The root is the underlying tendency.  
You gotta get the ROOT,  
Or you're just trimming branches forever.

---

### Verses 339-340: The Thirty-Six Streams

**The Blues Truth:**

In you flow THIRTY-SIX streams—  
Pleasant and strong.  
Six sense doors times three times two:  
Past, present, future—  
Internal, external.

The one with wrong view  
Gets CARRIED AWAY  
By passionate intentions.

Streams are flowing EVERYWHERE.  
Creepers stay where they grow.  
When you SEE this creeper arise,  
Cut its ROOT with wisdom.

Don't just admire the vine.  
Don't just watch the stream.  
CUT. With wisdom.

**Blues Notes:** The thirty-six streams are a technical teaching: six sense bases × (craving for internal objects + craving for external objects) × (past + present + future) = 36 streams of craving.

---

### Verses 341-343: Crawling Like a Hare in a Trap

**The Blues Truth:**

There are flowing streams  
Of affection and mental happiness—  
We love those streams.

Pleasure-dependent,  
We seek happiness,  
And undergo birth and old age.  
Again. And again.

People surrounded by craving  
CRAWL AROUND  
Like a hare caught in a trap—  
Attached to fetters,  
Clinging tight,  
Coming back to suffering  
For a long, long time.

So REMOVE that craving.  
The monk who longs for dispassion  
Should cut it out.  
Stop crawling.  
Stand up.

**Blues Notes:** *Saso va bādhito*—like a hare in a trap. The image is vivid: not walking, but CRAWLING, unable to escape. That's what craving does to you.

---

### Verse 344: Free, Yet Running Back to Bondage

**The Blues Truth:**

LOOK at that person—  
Free from desire,  
Intent on solitude,  
Released from the forest of attachment—

Yet RUNNING BACK to the forest.

Come here and SEE that one:  
Though FREE, he runs back to bondage.

Incredible, right?  
Hands untied, yet grabs the chains again.  
Door open, yet walks back to prison.

Don't be that guy.

---

### Verses 345-346: The Real Bonds

**The Blues Truth:**

The wise say  
Iron bonds aren't strong.  
Wooden bonds aren't strong.  
Rope bonds aren't strong.

But IMPASSIONED attachment  
To jewels and earrings,  
To children and wives—  
THAT bondage is strong, say the wise.

It DRAGS you down.  
It's subtle but HARD to escape.

Those who cut THIS bondage  
Wander freely,  
Seeking nothing,  
Abandoning pleasure's happiness.

Cut the REAL bonds—  
Not the visible ones.

---

### Verse 347: The Spider's Web

**The Blues Truth:**

Those impassioned by passion  
Follow the stream—  
Like a SPIDER caught in its own web.

You spin the silk.  
You weave the trap.  
Then you GET CAUGHT  
In what you made yourself.

But the WISE cut through,  
Seeking nothing,  
Abandoning ALL suffering.

Don't spin your own prison.

---

### Verse 348: Be Free of Past, Future, Present

**The Blues Truth:**

Be FREE of the past.  
Be FREE of the future.  
Be FREE of the present.

Cross over ALL existence.  
Mind liberated in EVERY way.

Then you won't return  
To birth and old age.

Three times:  
Past—let go.  
Future—let go.  
Present—let go.

That's the whole thing.

**Blues Notes:** *Muñca pure, muñca pacchato, majjhe muñca*—be free of before, after, and in between. This is one of the most famous verses—complete liberation from temporal clinging.

### Verses 349-350: Thoughts, Passion, and Their Antidote

**The Blues Truth:**

For a person CRUSHED by thoughts,  
Pierced by passion,  
Contemplating the attractive—  
Craving increases MORE.  
The bond gets FIRMER.

That's the spiral down.

But whoever DELIGHTS  
In calming thoughts,  
Who MINDFULLY cultivates  
What is UNattractive—  
THAT one abolishes craving.  
THAT one cuts Māra's bond.

Same mind. Different cultivation.  
Different results.

---

### Verses 351-352: The Final Body

**The Blues Truth:**

Having gone to THE END,  
Without trembling,  
Without craving,  
Without impurity,  
Cutting off existence's darts—

This is the FINAL body.  
No more after this.

Without craving, without attachment,  
Skilled in understanding,  
The one in the final body  
Is called a person of GREAT WISDOM.

That's the destination.  
Final stop.

---

### Verse 353: The Buddha's Own Words

**The Blues Truth:**

"ALL-CONQUERING,  
ALL-WISE am I.  
Undefiled regarding all things.

Having given up EVERYTHING,  
Liberated through craving's destruction.

When I have THIS deep knowledge myself—  
Who should I point to as teacher?"

This is the Buddha speaking  
Right after his awakening.  
He found it HIMSELF.  
Now he teaches US.

---

### Verse 354: The Gift That Surpasses All

**The Blues Truth:**

The gift of DHAMMA  
Surpasses all other gifts.

The TASTE of Dhamma  
Surpasses all other tastes.

The LOVE of Dhamma  
Surpasses all other loves.

The DESTRUCTION of craving  
Overcomes all suffering.

Four supremes.  
Remember them.

**Blues Notes:** *Sabbadānaṁ Dhammadānaṁ jināti*—the gift of Dhamma surpasses all gifts. This verse is recited at the end of every Dhamma talk.

---

### Verse 355: Riches Destroy the Stupid

**The Blues Truth:**

Riches DESTROY the stupid one  
Who doesn't seek the way beyond.

Through his craving for riches,  
The stupid one destroys  
OTHERS and HIMSELF.

Wealth ain't the problem.  
CRAVING for wealth is the problem.  
And it takes down everything in its path.

---

### Verses 356-359: The Four Weeds

**The Blues Truth:**

Fields are ruined by WEEDS.  
These people are ruined by PASSION.  
So give to those WITHOUT passion—  
Great fruit from that gift.

Fields are ruined by WEEDS.  
These people are ruined by HATRED.  
So give to those WITHOUT hatred—  
Great fruit from that gift.

Fields are ruined by WEEDS.  
These people are ruined by DELUSION.  
So give to those WITHOUT delusion—  
Great fruit from that gift.

Fields are ruined by WEEDS.  
These people are ruined by DESIRE.  
So give to those WITHOUT desire—  
Great fruit from that gift.

Four weeds:  
Passion. Hatred. Delusion. Desire.  
Find those who've cleared the weeds.  
Support THEM.

---

1. Craving grows like a strangling creeper for the heedless
2. Like a monkey, the craving person rushes from thing to thing
3. Overcome craving, and grief rolls off like water off a lotus
4. DIG UP the root—don't just cut branches
5. Thirty-six streams of craving flow through you
6. People with craving crawl like hares in a trap

8. The real bonds are attachment to jewels, children, spouses
9. We spin our own web like the spider
10. Be free of past, future, AND present
11. Cultivate the unattractive to abolish craving
12. The Buddha himself conquered through craving's destruction
13. The gift of Dhamma surpasses all gifts

Craving is the ROOT.  
Everything else is branches.  
Get the root,  
And the tree dies forever.

# Chapter 25: Bhikkhuvagga - Blues Edition
## The Monk: Portrait of the Practitioner

---

## Opening Words

Who is the real monk? Not the one who wears the robe. Not the one who shaves the head. Not the one who begs for food. The REAL monk is the one who restrains, who meditates, who cuts off passion and hatred, who shines like the moon from behind clouds. This chapter paints that portrait—23 verses on what it really means to walk this path.

---

### Verses 360-361: Restraint of the Six Doors

**The Blues Truth:**

Restraint of the EYE is good.  
Restraint of the EAR is good.  
Restraint of the NOSE is good.  
Restraint of the TONGUE is good.

Restraint of the BODY is good.  
Restraint of SPEECH is good.  
Restraint of the MIND is good.  
Restraint is EVERYWHERE good.

The monk restrained everywhere?  
Liberated from ALL suffering.

Six doors. Seven gates.  
Close the ones that need closing.  
Open the ones that need opening.  
THAT'S the practice.

**Blues Notes:** *Sabbattha saṁvuto bhikkhu sabbadukkhā pamuccati*—the monk restrained everywhere is freed from all suffering. This is the fruit of restraint: complete liberation.

---

### Verse 362: The True Monk

**The Blues Truth:**

Controls his HANDS.  
Controls his FEET.  
Controls his SPEECH.  
Controls the MIND supreme.

Has inner delight.  
Has composure.  
Is solitary.  
Is content.

THAT one is called a monk.

Not the robe.  
Not the bowl.  
Not the head-shaving.  
The CONTROL—that makes the monk.

---

### Verse 363: Sweet Speech

**The Blues Truth:**

That monk who restrains the mouth,  
Who speaks WELL,  
Who is modest—

Who explains the MEANING of Dhamma—  
That one's speech is SWEET.

Not sugary. Not flattering.  
SWEET—like honey that heals.  
Truth spoken beautifully.  
That's what a monk's words should sound like.

---

### Verse 364: Delighting in Dhamma

**The Blues Truth:**

The one who finds PLEASURE in Dhamma,  
Who DELIGHTS in Dhamma,  
Who REFLECTS on Dhamma,  
Who REMEMBERS Dhamma—

That monk does NOT fall away  
From the Good Dhamma.

Four ways to stay close:  
Pleasure. Delight. Reflection. Remembrance.  
Keep the Dhamma in your heart,  
And you won't lose the way.

---

### Verses 365-366: Don't Despise Your Gains

**The Blues Truth:**

Don't despise what you've got.  
Don't live envious of others.

The monk envious of others?  
Does NOT attain concentration.  
Can't settle the mind  
When it's busy comparing.

Even if you gain LITTLE,  
Don't despise your gains.  
Even the GODS praise  
The one of pure life who is diligent.

Take what comes.  
Practice with THAT.  
Envy blocks the path.

---

### Verse 367: No Fondness for Mind and Body

**The Blues Truth:**

The one who has NO fondness  
For mind and body—  
Not attached to name-and-form—

Who grieves not  
For what does not exist—

THAT one is surely called a monk.

No clinging to this heap of processes.  
No mourning for what's already gone.  
Clean. Clear. Free.

---

### Verse 368: Dwelling in Loving-Kindness

**The Blues Truth:**

The monk who DWELLS in loving-kindness,  
With FAITH in Buddha's teaching—

Should attain the state of PEACE,  
The joy in stilling ALL conditions.

Mettā—loving-kindness—  
That's the dwelling place.  
Faith—that's the foundation.  
Peace—that's the destination.

---

### Verse 369: Bail Out This Boat

**The Blues Truth:**

BAIL OUT this boat, monk!  
When it's bailed out,  
It'll go LIGHTLY.

Cut off PASSION.  
Cut off HATRED.  
Then from here  
You'll go to NIBBĀNA.

Your boat's taking on water.  
Passion and hatred are the leaks.  
Bail them out.  
Plug the holes.  
Then you'll sail smooth.

**Blues Notes:** *Siñca bhikkhu imaṁ nāvaṁ*—bail out this boat, monk. The body/mind is the boat. Passion and hatred are the water flooding in. Keep bailing.

---

### Verse 370: The Rule of Fives

**The Blues Truth:**

CUT five.  
ABANDON five.  
CULTIVATE five more.

The monk who surmounts five attachments  
Is called a FLOOD-CROSSER.

What are these fives?  
**Cut**: the five lower fetters (identity view, doubt, rites-and-rituals clinging, sensual desire, ill-will).  
**Abandon**: the five higher fetters (craving for form, craving for formless, conceit, restlessness, ignorance).  
**Cultivate**: the five spiritual faculties (faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom).  
**Surmount**: the five attachments (passion, hatred, delusion, conceit, wrong view).

Cross the flood.

---

### Verse 371: Meditate, Monk!

**The Blues Truth:**

MEDITATE, monk!  
Do NOT be heedless!

Don't let your mind  
SWIRL around in strands of desire.

Don't, heedless,  
SWALLOW a hot iron ball.

Don't, while BURNING,  
Cry out: "This is suffering!"

By then it's too late.  
Practice NOW.  
Before the burning.

---

### Verse 372: Jhāna and Paññā

**The Blues Truth:**

No CONCENTRATION for one without wisdom.  
No WISDOM for one without concentration.

But the one who has BOTH—  
Concentration AND wisdom—  
Is in the PRESENCE of Nibbāna.

Can't have one without the other.  
They feed each other.  
They need each other.  
Get BOTH.

---

### Verse 373: Superhuman Delight

**The Blues Truth:**

For the one who enters an EMPTY place,  
With a PEACEFUL mind—

There is SUPERHUMAN delight  
From insight into true Dhamma.

Superhuman.  
Not the pleasure of the senses.  
Not the happiness of getting.  
SUPERHUMAN—the delight of seeing true.

That's what waits in the empty room  
For the peaceful mind.

---

### Verse 374: The Rise and Fall

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever has right MINDFULNESS  
Regarding the RISE and FALL  
Of the components of mind and body—

Gains JOY and HAPPINESS.

That is the DEATHLESS state  
For the one who knows.

Rise and fall.  
Rising and passing.  
See it clearly,  
And touch the deathless.

---

### Verses 375-376: The Beginning for the Wise Monk

**The Blues Truth:**

THIS is the very beginning  
For the wise monk:

CONTENTMENT.  
GUARDING the senses.  
RESTRAINT in the regulations.

Resort to SPIRITUAL FRIENDS—  
Ones of pure life,  
Ones who are diligent.

Be FRIENDLY in disposition.  
Be SKILFUL in conduct.

Rejoicing because of THAT—  
One will make an END to suffering.

Start here.  
Good friends. Sense restraint. Contentment.  
THAT'S how you begin.

---

### Verse 377: Cast Off Like Withered Flowers

**The Blues Truth:**

Just as the striped jasmine  
Casts off its withered flowers—

So, monks,  
Cast off PASSION and HATRED.

The flower doesn't cling  
To what's dead.  
Neither should you.

Let it fall.  
Let it go.  
Passion. Hatred.  
Cast them off.

---

### Verse 378: The One at Peace

**The Blues Truth:**

CALM in body.  
CALM in speech.  
Having calmness and composure.

Having thrown off worldly gain—

THAT monk is called  
One at PEACE.

*Upasanto*—at peace.  
Not chasing.  
Not grasping.  
CALM through and through.

---

### Verses 379-380: Self Is the Refuge

**The Blues Truth:**

By ONESELF one should censure self.  
By ONESELF one should be controlled.

He who guards himself, mindful,  
Will live HAPPILY, monk.

SELF is the protector of self.  
SELF is the refuge of self.

Therefore restrain yourself—  
Like a merchant restrains his noble horse.

You're the one.  
No one else can do it for you.  
Guard yourself.  
Train yourself.  
Be your own refuge.

---

### Verse 381: The State of Peace Again

**The Blues Truth:**

The monk having much HAPPINESS,  
With FAITH in the Buddha's teaching—

Could attain the state of PEACE,  
Happy in the stilling of ALL conditions.

This verse repeats the promise:  
Faith + Joy = Peace.  
The path is well-marked.

---

### Verse 382: The Young Monk Shines

**The Blues Truth:**

That YOUNG monk  
Who is devoted to the Buddha's teaching—

SHINES FORTH in this world  
Like the MOON freed from a cloud.

Young in years, maybe.  
But devoted?  
DEVOTED.

That one SHINES.  
The cloud passes.  
The moon appears.  
Brilliant. Pure. Light.

---

## End of Chapter 25: The Monk

**What We Learned:**

1. Restraint of eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, speech, and mind = freedom
2. The true monk controls hands, feet, speech, mind—with inner delight
3. Sweet speech comes from restraining the mouth and explaining Dhamma
4. Don't despise your gains, don't envy others
5. No fondness for mind-body, no grief for what doesn't exist
6. Dwell in loving-kindness, attain peace
7. Bail out the boat—cut passion and hatred
8. Cut 5, abandon 5, cultivate 5, surmount 5 = flood-crosser
9. Meditate or swallow iron balls later
10. No jhāna without paññā, no paññā without jhāna
11. Superhuman delight comes in empty places with peaceful minds
12. See rise and fall of phenomena = touch the deathless
13. Beginning: contentment, sense-guarding, good friends
14. Cast off passion and hatred like withered flowers
15. Self is the protector and refuge of self
16. The devoted young monk shines like moon from clouds

THIS is what a monk looks like.  
Not the outfit.  
The PRACTICE.

# Chapter 26: Brāhmaṇavagga - Blues Edition
## The Brahmin: That One I Call Awakened

---

## Opening Words

This is the FINAL chapter—41 verses that redefine what it means to be a "brahmin." In Buddha's time, brahmins claimed spiritual superiority by birth. The Buddha said NO. A true brahmin is one who has AWAKENED—regardless of caste, family, or lineage. Forty-one verses, each ending with the refrain: "THAT one I call a brahmin."

This isn't about caste. It's about AWAKENING.

---

### Verses 383-384: Strive and Cut the Stream

**The Blues Truth:**

STRIVE. Cut off the stream.  
Remove desire, seeker.  
Know the destruction of the conditioned—  
Be one who knows the UNCONDITIONED.

When through TWO things  
The seeker has crossed over—  
Concentration and insight,  
Calm and seeing—  
All fetters are laid to rest  
For one who knows.

THAT one I call a brahmin.

---

### Verse 385: No Near Shore, No Far Shore

**The Blues Truth:**

For whom the near shore doesn't exist,  
The far shore doesn't exist,  
NEITHER shore exists—

Free of anxiety,  
Detached—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

What's the near shore? This life of clinging.  
What's the far shore? The next life.  
Transcend BOTH.

---

### Verse 386: The Dustless Meditator

**The Blues Truth:**

The meditator sitting down,  
DUSTLESS,  
Who has done the duty,  
Without pollutants,  
Who has reached the ultimate good—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

Not just sitting.  
DUSTLESS sitting.  
Duty DONE.  
That's the real thing.

---

### Verse 387: The Buddha's Radiance

**The Blues Truth:**

The SUN is radiant by day.  
The MOON shines by night.  
The armored NOBLE is radiant (in battle).  
The meditating BRAHMIN is radiant.

Yet every day AND night,  
The BUDDHA is radiant through his power.

Sun has its time. Moon has its time.  
Buddha? ALL the time.

---

### Verse 388: The Etymology of "Brahmin"

**The Blues Truth:**

WARDING OFF wickedness—  
That's what makes one a *brāhmaṇa*.  
Living austerely—  
That's what makes one a *samaṇa* (ascetic).  
Driving forth all stain from oneself—  
That's what makes one *pabbajita* (one who has gone forth).

The Buddha's redefining terms here.  
It's not about birth.  
It's about PRACTICE.

---

### Verses 389-390: Don't Strike a Brahmin

**The Blues Truth:**

Don't STRIKE a (true) brahmin.  
Don't let fly at him.

Woe to one who strikes a brahmin.  
FURTHER woe to one who lets fly!

And it is no LITTLE good for the brahmin  
When the mind is held back from what's dear,  
When the mind turns back from violence—  
THEN suffering calms.

Non-violence is the true brahmin's way.

---

### Verse 391: Restrained in Three Things

**The Blues Truth:**

For whom there is NO wrong-doing—  
Bodily, verbally, or mentally—  
Restrained in THREE things—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

Three doors. Three restraints.  
Body. Speech. Mind.  
Close the wrong doors.

---

### Verse 392: Bow to Your Teacher

**The Blues Truth:**

One from whom you learned Dhamma—  
Taught by the Perfect Buddha—

BOW to that one with respect,  
Like a brahmin bows at fire-sacrifice.

Honor your teachers.  
They gave you the Teaching.

---

### Verse 393-394: Not Birth, But Truth

**The Blues Truth:**

Not because of MATTED HAIR,  
Not because of FAMILY,  
Not because of BIRTH  
Is one a true brahmin.

In whom there is TRUTH and DHAMMA—  
That one is PURE.  
THAT one is surely a brahmin.

Why the matted hair, foolish one?  
Why the deer-skin?  
Within you is a JUNGLE.  
You only polish the OUTSIDE.

It's not the costume.  
It's what's INSIDE.

---

### Verse 395: The Forest Meditator

**The Blues Truth:**

That one who wears discarded clothes,  
LEAN with protruding veins,  
Who meditates ALONE in the forest—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

Not the well-fed. Not the comfortable.  
The ASCETIC. The solitary. The dedicated.

---

### Verse 396: Not Birth, But Non-Attachment

**The Blues Truth:**

I do NOT call one a brahmin  
Simply because of being born from a womb.

That one just says "bho" (a polite title)  
If he's still attached.

Having NOTHING and UNATTACHED—  
THAT one I call a brahmin.

Birth is accident.  
Non-attachment is CHOICE.

---

### Verse 397: Cut All Fetters, Don't Tremble

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever has CUT OFF all the fetters  
Surely does NOT tremble.

Surmounting attachments,  
Detached—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

When the chains are cut,  
Why would you shake?

---

### Verse 398: The Thong, the Strap, the Rope

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever has cut off the THONG,  
The STRAP,  
The ROPE,  
Together with the BRIDLE—

Who has thrown off the obstacle  
And is AWAKENED—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

What are these bonds?  
Hatred (thong), craving (strap), wrong views (rope), ignorance (bridle).  
Cut them ALL.

---

### Verse 399: Endurance Is Strength

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever, being PURE,  
Forbears with punishment, bondage, and abuse—  
Having the strength of ENDURANCE,  
Having an army of strengths—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

Patience isn't weakness.  
It's an ARMY.

---

### Verse 400: The Final Body

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever is controlled of mind,  
Dutiful, virtuous, taint-free,  
Well-trained  
And in the FINAL body—

No more bodies after this.  
FINAL stop.

---

### Verse 401: Unsmeared by Desires

**The Blues Truth:**

Like WATER on the lotus leaf,  
Like a MUSTARD SEED on a needle—  
Not sticking—

He who is UNSMEARED by desires—

The water rolls off.  
The seed can't balance.  
Desire DOESN'T STICK.

---

### Verse 402: Knowing Suffering's End

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever knows RIGHT HERE  
The destruction of suffering,  
Putting down the BURDEN,  
Detached—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

Not some other life.  
RIGHT HERE.  
Burden DOWN.

---

### Verse 403: Deeply Wise

**The Blues Truth:**

The DEEPLY wise sagacious one,  
Skilled in what IS path and what ISN'T path,  
Who has reached the ultimate good—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

Knows the way.  
Knows what's NOT the way.  
That discernment—THAT'S wisdom.

---

### Verse 404: Doesn't Mix

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever doesn't mix  
With either householders OR the houseless—  
Wandering homeless,  
With FEW desires—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

Not playing social games.  
Not accumulating contacts.  
UNENTANGLED.

---

### Verse 405: Laid Down the Stick

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever has laid down the STICK  
Used against all beings—  
Fearful AND fearless—  
Who neither hurts nor kills—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

The stick is DOWN.  
No violence.  
No killing.  
THAT'S the true brahmin.

---

### Verse 406: Friendly Among the Hostile

**The Blues Truth:**

Being FRIENDLY with the hostile,  
CALM amongst those holding sticks,  
NOT attached amongst those attached—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

They're armed—you're calm.  
They're clinging—you're free.

---

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever has dropped off  
Passion and hatred,  
Conceit and anger—  
Like a MUSTARD SEED from a needle—

It WON'T stay.  
That's how these defilements should be—  
Gone before they settle.

---

### Verse 408: Truth Spoken Gently

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever speaks a word of TRUTH  
That is informed and NOT coarse—

Truth can be GENTLE.

Whoever in this world  
Does NOT take what is not given—  
Long or short,  
Small or large,  
Attractive or unattractive—

Nothing that isn't offered.  
NOTHING.

---

### Verse 410: No Longings

**The Blues Truth:**

For one who has NO longings—  
In this world OR the next—  
Being without longings,  
Detached—

No craving for THIS life.  
No craving for the NEXT.  
Just... free.

---

### Verse 411: Immersion in the Deathless

For one who has NO desires,  
Who through knowledge is without doubt,

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever here has overcome  
Clinging to BOTH merit AND demerit—

**The Blues Truth:**

He who has crossed the difficult  
And dangerous path  
Through births and deaths and delusion—

Free of lust, free of doubt,  
Unattached and COOLED DOWN—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

The crossing is DONE.  
The far shore REACHED.

Free of lust,  
CLEANSED and AWAKENED—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

Every noble quality.  
All in one being.

### Verse 423: The Final Verse

**The Blues Truth:**

Whoever knows their FORMER lives,  
And sees heaven and the downfall,  
And has attained BIRTH'S DESTRUCTION—  
The sage, accomplished in deep knowledge,  
Who is accomplished in ALL accomplishments—

THAT one I call a brahmin.

**Final Blues Notes:**

This isn't about caste. This isn't about birth. This isn't about what family you came from or what robe you wear.

**THAT ONE I CALL A BRAHMIN**—the one who lives it.

Not by talking.

By LIVING the Dhamma.

That's the whole thing.

That's the Dhammapada.
