## Blues Vernacular Lyrics

*Verse 1 (Verse 3)*
```
He tried to knock me down, he swung his heavy hand,
Stole my peace, took my ground, left me in the sand.
```

*Verse 2 (Verse 4)*
```
He came again, same old song, but I won’t hold that grudge,
Let the fire fade, let the anger slip, I’m moving past the judge.
```
