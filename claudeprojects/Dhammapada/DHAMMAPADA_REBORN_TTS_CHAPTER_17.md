# Chapter 17: Anger

Anger. Swerving like a runaway chariot. Only the one who holds it back is the real driver—everyone else is just holding reins. This chapter gives the antidotes: overcome anger with non-anger, bad with good, stinginess with giving, lies with truth. And remember: nobody in the world escapes blame. Don't even try.

## Verses 221, 222, and 223: The Charioteer

The Buddha said:

"Abandon anger, abandon conceit, overcome every fetter. Without clinging to mind and body, sufferings never befall the one without possessions.

Whoever holds back arisen anger like controlling a swerving chariot—that one I call a charioteer. Others are merely rein-holders.

Through non-anger, overcome anger. Through goodness, overcome bad. Through giving, overcome stinginess. Through truth, overcome lying."

And here's the Blues truth: Abandon anger, abandon conceit. Get past every chain. Don't cling to mind and body—and suffering won't remain.

Anger rises like a swerving chariot running off the road. Hold it back—THAT'S the charioteer's code. Others just hold the reins. They're along for the ride. But the one who CONTROLS the anger? THAT'S the one with real mastery.

The four antidotes: Overcome anger with NON-anger. Overcome bad with GOOD. Overcome stinginess with GIVING. Overcome lies with TRUTH.

## Verses 224, 225, and 226: Truth, No Anger, Give

The Buddha said:

"Speak truth. Don't get angry. Give when asked, even a little. Through these three conditions, one can go to the presence of the gods.

Those sages without violence, constantly restrained in body, go to the deathless state—having gone there, they grieve not.

For those always wakeful, training day and night, intent on Nibbāna—the pollutants are laid to rest."

And here's the Blues truth: Speak truth. Don't get angry. Give when asked—even a little. These three things take you to the divine threshold.

Sages without violence, restrained in body always—they go to the deathless state. Gone there, they never grieve again.

Always wakeful, training day and night, intent on Nibbāna—the pollutants lose their might.

## Verses 227, 228, 229, and 230: Nobody Escapes Blame

The Buddha said:

"This is something ancient, Atula—not just today: they blame the silent one; they blame the talkative; they blame the moderate speaker. No one in the world goes unblamed.

There never was, nor will there be, nor is there found at present, a person totally blameworthy or one totally praiseworthy.

One whom the wise praise after daily examination—faultless in conduct, sagacious, endowed with wisdom and virtue—like a golden coin, who is worthy to blame that one? Even gods praise them; even Brahmā praises them."

And here's the Blues truth: This is OLD, Atula—not just today. People blame the quiet one. People blame the talker. People blame the moderate too. NOBODY in the world escapes blame.

Never was, never will be—nobody totally blameworthy or totally praiseworthy. Don't hold your breath waiting for universal approval. It doesn't exist.

BUT—one the wise examine and praise, faultless, sagacious, wise—like a gold coin of finest quality, who's worthy to criticize? The gods praise that one. Brahmā himself praises that one. Don't seek everyone's approval. Seek the praise of the WISE.

## Verses 231, 232, 233, and 234: Three Gates

The Buddha said:

"Guard against bodily anger; be restrained in body. Abandoning wrong bodily conduct, practice good bodily conduct.

Guard against verbal anger; be restrained in speech. Abandoning wrong verbal conduct, practice good verbal conduct.

Guard against mental anger; be restrained in mind. Abandoning wrong mental conduct, practice good mental conduct.

The wise are restrained in body, then restrained in speech, then restrained in mind—they are indeed fully restrained."

And here's the Blues truth: Three gates. Three places anger expresses itself.

Guard against anger in the BODY. Be restrained with the flesh. Drop the wrong; do the right. In body, be your best.

Guard against anger in SPEECH. Be restrained with the tongue. Drop the wrong; do the right. Watch what words are sung.

Guard against anger in MIND. Be restrained in thought. Drop the wrong; do the right. In mind, let anger rot.

Body, speech, and mind—restrained in all three gates. The wise are FULLY restrained. That's the liberated state.

## End of Chapter 17

What we learned in these fourteen verses gives us mastery over anger. Abandon anger, abandon conceit. Be the charioteer—hold back the swerving anger. Overcome anger with non-anger. Overcome bad with good, stinginess with giving, lies with truth. Speak truth, don't get angry, give even a little. Nobody in the world escapes blame—don't seek universal approval. Seek the praise of the wise and the gods. Guard against anger in body, speech, and mind. The fully restrained are wise.

Hold back the swerving chariot. Don't just hold the reins. Be the CHARIOTEER of anger—that's how freedom remains.
