# Chapter 23: The Elephant

The elephant was the mightiest animal in ancient India—patient, powerful, wise. The Buddha loved this image. He called himself "the elephant" in his final days. This chapter teaches you to BE the elephant: endure abuse like an arrow in battle, train yourself like the royal tusker, and when no good companion can be found—walk alone through the forest like the solitary bull.

## Verses 320 and 321: Endure Abuse Like an Elephant in Battle

The Buddha said:

"Like an elephant in battle endures an arrow shot from bow, so shall I endure abuse—for many people are unvirtuous.

They lead one trained into a crowd; a king mounts one who has been trained. Amongst humans, the trained one is best—the one who can endure abuse."

And here's the Blues truth: Like an ELEPHANT in battle endures an arrow shot from the bow—that's how I will endure abuse. Why? Because many people are unvirtuous. That's just how it is. They're gonna talk. They're gonna hate.

But the TRAINED one—that's who they lead into crowds. That's who kings mount. The trained one is BEST among humans—the one who can endure. Stand like the elephant. Let the arrows fall. Keep moving.

## Verses 322 and 323: Self-Training Is the Noblest

The Buddha said:

"Noble are the well-trained horses, the well-bred horses from Sindh, and the great tusker elephants—but more noble still is one who has trained themselves.

Not by these vehicles can one go to the destination beyond destinations—as one, through training oneself well, being trained, goes by that training."

And here's the Blues truth: Noble are the well-trained horses. Noble are the well-bred steeds from Sindh. Noble are the great tusker elephants.

But MORE noble than all of these? The one who has TRAINED THEMSELVES.

You can't ride a horse to Nibbāna. You can't travel by elephant to the place beyond all destinations. But through training YOURSELF well—being trained by the training—THAT'S how you get there. No vehicle takes you. Only the trained mind arrives.

## Verse 324: Dhanapālaka Remembers the Forest

The Buddha said:

"The tusker named Dhanapālaka, musty in rut and difficult to restrain, though bound, does not eat even a morsel—the tusker remembers the elephant forest."

And here's the Blues truth: There was a tusker named DHANAPĀLAKA—"Guardian of Wealth." Captured, musty in rut, difficult to restrain. They bound him up. Gave him food. But he wouldn't eat a MORSEL. Why? He remembered the elephant forest. He remembered where he came from. He remembered FREEDOM.

Do YOU remember where freedom lives? Let that memory sustain you, even when you're bound.

## Verse 325: Don't Be the Pig

The Buddha said:

"When one is torpid and overeats, sleepy, rolling on the bed, like a great pig fed on fodder—that fool comes to the womb again."

And here's the Blues truth: When you're TORPID, when you overeat, when you're sleepy, rolling around in bed—you're like a great PIG fed on fodder. Stuffed and stupid.

And that fool comes to the WOMB again. Rebirth after rebirth. Is that what you want? Wake UP. The elephant remembers freedom; the pig just eats and sleeps into rebirth.

## Verse 326: Control the Mind Like an Elephant with a Goad

The Buddha said:

"Formerly this wandering mind wandered through desire, pleasure, and delight. But today I shall control it wisely—like the man with goad controls an elephant in musth."

And here's the Blues truth: BEFORE—this wandering mind wandered everywhere. Through desire. Through pleasure. Through whatever it wanted.

But TODAY—I will control it WISELY. Like the one with a GOAD controls an elephant in rut. That elephant is wild. Dangerous. But with skill and a goad, you can direct it. Same with your mind. Time to take the goad in hand.

---

## Verse 327: Raise Yourself from the Pit

The Buddha said:

"You should delight in heedfulness; you should always protect your mind. Raise yourself from this difficult ground—like a tusker sunk in mud."

And here's the Blues truth: Delight in HEEDFULNESS. Protect your MIND. ALWAYS.

You're stuck in a pit right now—like a tusker sunk in the mud. But even the elephant can pull itself free. It RAISES itself from the muck. You can too. Pull yourself up. Out of the pit. Into freedom.

## Verses 328, 329, and 330: On Friendship and Solitude

The Buddha said:

"If you should find a prudent friend, a companion who lives well and wisely, overcoming all your troubles, you should live with that one—glad and mindful.

But if you do not find a prudent friend, a companion who lives well and wisely, like a king who abandons his conquered kingdom—one should live alone, like a solitary elephant in the forest.

Better to live alone—there can be no friendship with a fool. Living alone, one should do no wrong, unconcerned, like a solitary elephant in the forest."

And here's the Blues truth: IF you find a PRUDENT friend—one who lives well, who's wise—STAY with that one. Walk together. Overcome your troubles together. Be glad. Be mindful.

BUT—if you DON'T find such a friend? Then be like a KING who abandons his conquered kingdom. Walk ALONE. Like a solitary elephant in the forest.

BETTER to live alone than be friends with a fool. Unconcerned. Free. Like the bull elephant who needs no herd. It's better to walk alone than walk wrong with company.

## Verses 331, 332, and 333: What Is Good

The Buddha said:

"Friends are good when need arises; contentment with whatever one has is good; merit at life's end is good; the abandoning of all suffering is good.

Respecting mother is good in the world; also respecting father is good; respecting ascetics is good in the world; also respecting true brahmins is good.

Moral conduct until old age is good; the establishment of faith is good; the acquisition of wisdom is good; refraining from evil is good."

And here's the Blues truth: Friends are GOOD when need arises. Being content with whatever? GOOD. Merit at the end of life? GOOD. Abandoning all suffering? GOOD.

RESPECTING your mother is good. RESPECTING your father is good. RESPECTING ascetics and true teachers is good. Honor those who came before.

VIRTUOUS CONDUCT till old age is good. FAITH well-established is good. The ACQUISITION of wisdom is good. Doing NOTHING wicked is good. That's how you live like an elephant—noble from beginning to end.

## End of Chapter 23

What we learned in these fourteen verses teaches us to be the elephant. Endure abuse like an elephant endures arrows in battle. The trained one is best among humans. Self-training is nobler than any trained animal. You can't ride a vehicle to Nibbāna—only the trained mind arrives. Remember the "elephant forest"—your true home of freedom. Don't be the pig: torpid, overeating, sleepy. Control the wild mind like an elephant with a goad. Raise yourself from the mud-pit of suffering. If you find a wise friend, walk together gladly. If no wise friend, walk ALONE like the solitary elephant. Better alone than with fools. Respect mother, father, teachers, and the awakened. Keep virtue till old age; gather wisdom; do no wickedness.

Be the ELEPHANT—noble, patient, trained. Walking alone when necessary, enduring what must be endured, never forgetting where freedom lives.
