# Chapter 22: Hell

This chapter's about HELL. Not as a place outside you, but as the destination you CREATE through your actions. The Buddha's not trying to scare you—he's trying to WAKE you up. Every action has consequences. Some consequences take you down, down, down. Better to know that NOW than find out later.

## Verse 306: Liars Go to Hell

The Buddha said:

"The one who speaks falsely goes to the underworld, as does one who, having done, says 'I did not do.' Both of these, when they have passed on, become just the same—humans who did base deeds in the hereafter."

And here's the Blues truth: The one who speaks FALSELY—who says what isn't so—goes to the underworld. And the one who says "I didn't do it" when he DID? Same destination.

Both of them, when they pass on, end up in the same place. Lying about truth, lying about your actions—both roads lead DOWN.

## Verse 307: The Robe Doesn't Save You

The Buddha said:

"Many wearing the monastic robe around their necks are wicked and unrestrained—the wicked, through their wicked deeds, re-arise in the underworld."

And here's the Blues truth: MANY wear the monastic robe around their necks—but they're wicked inside. Unrestrained. Living foul.

You think that cloth protects you? Through wicked deeds, the wicked re-arise in the underworld. The robe is just CLOTH if the heart is still poison.

## Verse 308: Better to Eat a Glowing Iron Ball

The Buddha said:

"It is better to have swallowed a glowing iron ball, like a flame of fire, than that a monk—unvirtuous and unrestrained—should enjoy the country's almsfood."

And here's the Blues truth: LISTEN. It's BETTER to swallow a glowing iron ball, hot as fire's flame, than to enjoy the almsfood of the land without virtue, without restraint.

A burning metal ball in your belly is BETTER than living off others' generosity while being a hypocrite. That's how serious this is.

## Verses 309 and 310: The Four Results of Adultery

The Buddha said:

"There are four states the heedless man who consorts with another's wife undergoes: gaining demerit, an uncomfortable bed, blame as third, and the underworld as fourth.

Gaining demerit and a bad destiny, the small delight of a scared man with a scared woman, and heavy punishment from kings—therefore one should not consort with another's wife."

And here's the Blues truth: You heedless man, chasing after someone else's partner—here's what you get. FOUR states waiting:

ONE: Demerit—bad karma stacking up. TWO: An uncomfortable bed—no peace when you lie down. THREE: Blame—people know, they talk. FOUR: The underworld—where you end up reborn.

And what did you get? Only the small, fearful pleasure of a scared man with a scared woman. Kings apply heavy punishment. Was it worth it?

## Verses 311, 312, and 313: The Ascetic Life Wrongly Grasped

The Buddha said:

"As jagged grass, wrongly grasped, cuts into the hand, so does the monastic life, wrongly grasped, drag one down to the underworld.

Whatever lax deed there is, and whatever vow is defiled, a holy life that is doubtful—this does not produce great fruit.

If one would do what should be done, one should be firm in that effort. For the wanderer who is lax spreads much impurity."

And here's the Blues truth: KUSHA GRASS—you know the jagged kind? Grab it wrong, and it CUTS your hand. Blood everywhere.

The ascetic life is the same. Grab it wrong, practice it wrong, and it DRAGS you down to hell.

A lax deed? A defiled vow? A holy life that's doubtful? NAH—that ain't bearing great fruit.

If you're gonna do this thing, DO IT RIGHT. Be FIRM in your effort. The wanderer who's lax just spreads impurity everywhere.

## Verse 314: Better Undone is a Wrong-Doing

The Buddha said:

"Better undone is a wrong-doing, for a wrong-doing one later regrets. Better done is what is well-done, which, when done, one does not regret."

And here's the Blues truth: Here's wisdom in two lines.

BETTER UNDONE is a wrong-doing—'cause that wrong-doing is gonna BURN you later. You'll regret it. Leave it undone.

BETTER DONE is what's well-done—'cause that good deed brings no regret. You did right, and it sits right.

Simple calculus. Wrong leads to regret. Right leads to no regret. Make your choice.

## Verse 315: Guard Yourself Like a Border Town

The Buddha said:

"As a border town is guarded within and without, so should one guard oneself. Let not the moment pass—for when opportunity has passed, they grieve who are consigned to the underworld."

And here's the Blues truth: You know how they guard a border town? INSIDE and OUTSIDE. Watching every approach. Nothing gets past without notice.

That's how you should watch over YOURSELF. Guard the gates of your senses. Watch what comes in, watch what goes out.

And don't let the MOMENT pass. 'Cause when the chance is gone, they GRIEVE. Consigned to the underworld, they grieve. This moment is IT. Guard it like your life depends on it—because it does.

## Verses 316, 317, and 318: Wrong Views Lead to Bad Destiny

The Buddha said:

"They are ashamed of what is not shameful, not ashamed of what is shameful—undertaking wrong views, beings go to a bad destiny.

Seeing fear in what is not fearful, not seeing fear in what is fearful—undertaking wrong views, beings go to a bad destiny.

Finding fault in what is faultless, not seeing fault in what is faulty—undertaking wrong views, beings go to a bad destiny."

And here's the Blues truth: Three ways to get it backwards. Three ways to walk into hell with your eyes wide open.

ASHAMED of what's not shameful, NOT ashamed of what IS shameful—wrong views. Bad destiny.

SEEING FEAR in what's not fearful, NOT SEEING FEAR in what IS fearful—wrong views. Bad destiny.

FINDING BLAME in what's blameless, NOT SEEING BLAME in what IS blameable—wrong views. Bad destiny.

Your VIEW determines your destination. Get the view wrong, and you'll get lost in all the wrong places.

---

## Verse 319: Right Views Lead to Good Destiny

The Buddha said:

"Knowing blame in what is blameworthy, and no blame in what is blameless, undertaking right views, beings go to a good destiny."

And here's the Blues truth: HERE'S how to go RIGHT.

KNOWING blame in what's blameable, and NO blame in what's blameless. Right views. Good destiny.

See clearly what deserves criticism. See clearly what doesn't. Don't get it twisted. Undertake RIGHT views, and beings go to a GOOD destiny. View makes the path. Path makes the destination.

## End of Chapter 22

What we learned in these fourteen verses confronts us with hell and its causes. Liars—whether about facts or about their own actions—go to hell. The robe doesn't save you if your heart is wicked. Better to eat a glowing iron ball than enjoy almsfood without virtue. Adultery brings demerit, no peace, blame, and hell. The ascetic life wrongly grasped drags you DOWN. Be firm in effort—lax practice spreads impurity. Better UNDONE is a wrong-doing; better DONE is a right-doing. Guard yourself like a border town—inside and outside. Don't let the moment pass—or grieve in hell later. Wrong views about shame, fear, and blame lead to bad destiny. Right views—seeing clearly—lead to good destiny.

This ain't about scaring you. It's about WAKING you up. Consequences are REAL. View determines destination. Choose wisely.
