## The Dhammapada: An Introduction

The Dhammapada ("Verses of the Dhamma" or "Path of Truth") is among the most beloved and widely-studied texts in the Buddhist canon. Belonging to the Khuddaka Nikāya of the Pali Tipiṭaka, it comprises 423 verses organized into 26 chapters, each addressing specific themes of Buddhist ethical and contemplative practice.

### Historical Context

The text likely reached its current form around the 3rd century BCE, though individual verses may preserve teachings from the Buddha's own lifetime (circa 5th century BCE). The Dhammapada was among the first Buddhist texts translated into Western languages and remains the most frequently quoted Buddhist scripture.

### Structure

The twenty-six chapters (*vagga*) organize the verses thematically:

1. **Yamakavagga** — Twin Verses
2. **Appamādavagga** — Heedfulness
3. **Cittavagga** — Mind
4. **Pupphavagga** — Flowers
5. **Bālavagga** — Fools
6. **Paṇḍitavagga** — The Wise
7. **Arahantavagga** — The Arahant
8. **Sahassavagga** — Thousands
9. **Pāpavagga** — Evil
10. **Daṇḍavagga** — Violence
11. **Jarāvagga** — Old Age
12. **Attavagga** — Self
13. **Lokavagga** — The World
14. **Buddhavagga** — The Buddha
15. **Sukhavagga** — Happiness
16. **Piyavagga** — What Is Dear
17. **Kodhavagga** — Anger
18. **Malavagga** — Impurity
19. **Dhammaṭṭhavagga** — The Just
20. **Maggavagga** — The Path
21. **Pakiṇṇakavagga** — Miscellaneous
22. **Nirayavagga** — Hell
23. **Nāgavagga** — The Elephant
24. **Taṇhāvagga** — Craving
25. **Bhikkhuvagga** — The Monk
26. **Brāhmaṇavagga** — The Brahmin

### Key Themes

The Dhammapada addresses fundamental Buddhist concerns:

- **Mind as Primary**: "All phenomena are preceded by mind" (verse 1)—our mental orientation shapes experience
- **Karma as Psychological Causation**: Actions produce consequences through their effects on consciousness
- **Impermanence and Non-Self**: Liberation through insight into the conditioned nature of all phenomena
- **The Path of Practice**: Ethical conduct, meditation, and wisdom as the way to freedom
- **Craving as the Origin of Suffering**: The Second Noble Truth elaborated (especially Chapter 24)
- **Spiritual Transformation over Birth-Status**: True brahminhood defined by realization, not lineage (Chapter 26)

### Translation Approach

This translation prioritizes:

1. **Accuracy**: Faithful rendering of Pali meaning
2. **Clarity**: Contemporary English accessible to modern readers
3. **Context**: Footnotes providing essential background
4. **Philosophical Depth**: Engaging the ideas, not merely the words

# Part I: The Path of Wisdom

---

# Chapter 1: Yamakavagga (The Twin Verses)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Yamakavagga

The opening chapter of the Dhammapada presents ten pairs of "twin verses" (*yamaka*)—contrasting teachings that illuminate the path of wisdom through comparison with its opposite. These verses establish the foundational Buddhist understanding of mind, karma, and ethical causation. The chapter's structure is pedagogically brilliant: by juxtaposing wholesome and unwholesome mental states and their consequences, the Buddha makes the mechanics of karma immediately comprehensible.

The chapter begins with perhaps the most famous verse in Buddhist literature, asserting the primacy of mind (*mano*) in shaping human experience—a teaching that anticipates modern cognitive psychology while grounding Buddhist ethics in phenomenological observation.

---

### Verses 1-2: Mind as the Forerunner

**Verse 1**

All phenomena are preceded by mind, led by mind, created by mind.  
If one speaks or acts with a corrupted mind,  
Suffering follows them  
As the wheel follows the foot of the ox that draws the cart.[1]

**Verse 2**

All phenomena are preceded by mind, led by mind, created by mind.  
If one speaks or acts with a pure mind,  
Happiness follows them  
Like a shadow that never departs.[2]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Mind as Primary**: The Pali *manopubbaṅgamā dhammā* asserts that *dhamma* (phenomena, experiences, mental states) are "mind-preceded." This is not metaphysical idealism but phenomenological insight: all human experience is mediated through consciousness; our mental orientation determines how we engage with reality. The image of the ox-cart wheel following the ox's hoof illustrates the inexorable nature of karmic causation—suffering (*dukkha*) follows unwholesome action as automatically as the wheel follows the draft animal.

[2] **Purity and Happiness**: The word *pasanna* (pure, clear, radiant) describes not moral perfection but clarity of mind—consciousness free from the distortions of greed, hatred, and delusion. The shadow metaphor is particularly apt: just as a shadow is inseparable from its object in sunlight, happiness (*sukha*) naturally accompanies a clear, wholesome mind. Note the progression: mind → speech/action → inevitable consequence. This establishes the Buddhist understanding of karma as psychological causation, not cosmic bookkeeping.

---

### Verses 3-4: Hatred and Its Cessation

**Verse 3**

"He abused me, he struck me,  
He defeated me, he robbed me"—  
For those who dwell on such thoughts,  
Hatred is never appeased.[3]

**Verse 4**

"He abused me, he struck me,  
He defeated me, he robbed me"—  
For those who do not dwell on such thoughts,  
Hatred is thoroughly appeased.[4]

#### Footnotes

[3] **The Dwelling Mind**: The verb *upanayhanti* means to harbor, dwell upon, or nurse a grievance. The verse identifies the crucial difference between experiencing harm and perpetuating hatred: not the injury itself, but the mental rehearsal of injury (*"he abused me"*) that keeps resentment alive. This anticipates modern trauma psychology's understanding of how rumination extends suffering beyond the original event.

[4] **Non-Dwelling**: The identical litany of wrongs appears in both verses, but the response differs. *Na upanayhanti*—not dwelling on, not rehearsing—creates the condition for hatred's cessation (*upasammati*, "is thoroughly appeased" or "comes to rest"). The teaching is radical: peace depends not on receiving justice or revenge, but on releasing mental fixation on the injury. This is not passive acceptance but active mental training.

---

### Verse 5: The Ancient Law

**Verse 5**

For never in this world is hatred appeased by hatred;  
Hatred is appeased by non-hatred (*averena*) alone—  
This is the ancient, eternal law (*sanantano*).[5]

#### Footnotes

[5] **Eternal Dharma**: This verse, one of the most frequently quoted in Buddhist literature, articulates a principle the text calls *dhammo sanantano*—"the ancient, eternal law" or "timeless truth." The Pali *avera* (non-hatred, non-enmity) is not mere passivity but active cultivation of goodwill. The verse makes an empirical claim that can be tested in experience: cycles of retaliation never produce peace; only meeting hatred with non-hatred breaks the cycle. This teaching profoundly influenced figures from Gandhi to Martin Luther King Jr., though the Buddha's concern is primarily soteriological (liberation-focused) rather than political.

---

### Verse 6: Awareness of Mortality

**Verse 6**

Others do not understand that we are perishing here;  
But those who understand this—  
For them, quarrels cease.[6]

#### Footnotes

[6] **"We Are Perishing"**: The phrase *mayam ettha yamāmase* ("we are perishing/dying here") carries double meaning: (1) we are all mortal, facing death; (2) we are perishing/being destroyed by our conflicts. The word *pare* ("others," the unwise) don't grasp either truth. But *medhagā* (the wise, the discerning) who comprehend mortality and conflict's futility naturally abandon quarreling (*medhagā*). Buddhist meditation on death (*maraṇassati*) is not morbid but clarifying—awareness of life's brevity makes petty disputes absurd.

---

### Verses 7-8: Strength and Māra

**Verse 7**

One who dwells contemplating the beautiful (*subha*),  
With senses unrestrained,  
Immoderate in eating,  
Lazy, lacking energy—  
Māra overpowers them  
As wind overpowers a weak tree.[7]

**Verse 8**

One who dwells contemplating the unbeautiful (*asubha*),  
With senses well-restrained,  
Moderate in eating,  
Faithful, energetic—  
Māra cannot overpower them,  
As wind cannot overpower a mountain.[8]

#### Footnotes

[7] **Subha and Vulnerability**: *Subhānupassin* means "contemplating the beautiful/pleasant"—here, obsessive attraction to sensory pleasures. Combined with unrestrained senses (*indriyesu asaṁvutaṁ*), lack of moderation in food, and laziness (*kusīta*), this creates maximum vulnerability to *Māra* (death, the personification of unwholesome forces). The simile of wind and weak tree (*rukkhaṁ va dubbalaṁ*) emphasizes how addiction to pleasure weakens one's spiritual resilience.

[8] **Asubha and Strength**: *Asubhānupassin* traditionally refers to meditation on the body's unattractiveness—contemplating decay, impermanence, the constructed nature of beauty. This is not self-hatred but seeing clearly (*yathābhūta ñāṇa*). Combined with sense restraint (*susaṁvutaṁ*), moderation, faith (*saddhā*), and aroused energy (*āraddhavīriyaṁ*), one becomes as immovable as a mountain (*pabbata*). These verses outline early Buddhism's program of mental training: sense restraint, moderate living, contemplative insight, ethical effort.

### Verses 9-10: The Unfit and Fit for the Robe

**Verse 9**

One who is not free from defilements (*anikkasāva*)  
Yet wears the ochre robe (*kāsāvaṁ*),  
Lacking in self-control and truthfulness—  
Such a one is not worthy of the robe.[9]

**Verse 10**

But one who has expelled all defilements,  
Well-established in moral conduct,  
Possessed of self-control and truthfulness—  
Such a one is truly worthy of the robe.[10]

#### Footnotes

[9] **The Robe and Character**: *Kāsāva* is the ochre/saffron robe of Buddhist monastics. The verse warns against hypocrisy: wearing the outer sign of renunciation while lacking the inner transformation. *Anikkasāva* means "not free from intoxicants/defilements"—the heart still stained (*kasāva*) by greed, hatred, delusion. *Dama* (self-control, taming) and *sacca* (truthfulness, integrity) are prerequisites; without them, the robe is mere costume.

[10] **True Worthiness**: *Vantakasāva* means "one who has vomited out the defilements"—a visceral image of complete rejection of unwholesome states. *Sīlesu susamāhito* indicates firm establishment in ethical conduct (*sīla*). The verse establishes an early Buddhist principle: spiritual status depends on inner transformation, not outer signs. This teaching would later inform critiques of mere ritualism in favor of genuine practice.

---

### Verses 11-12: Essence and Non-Essence

**Verse 11**

Those who mistake the non-essential for the essential,  
And the essential for the non-essential—  
They do not reach the essential,  
Their thoughts moving in the wrong pasture.[11]

**Verse 12**

But having known the essential as essential,  
And the non-essential as non-essential,  
They reach the essential,  
Their thoughts moving in the right pasture.[12]

#### Footnotes

[11] **Sāra/Asāra**: *Sāra* means essence, core, heartwood; *asāra* is non-essence, hollow, sapwood. The metaphor comes from tree-felling: sapwood (*asāra*) looks substantial but has no strength; heartwood (*sāra*) is the valuable core. Those who mistake pleasure for happiness, wealth for security, reputation for worth—who chase *asāra* thinking it is *sāra*—cannot reach what truly matters. *Micchāsaṅkappa* (wrong intention/thought) leads to the wrong "pasture" (*gocara*)—feeding on what doesn't nourish.

[12] **Right Discernment**: The wise (*sammāsaṅkappagocarā*) distinguish true value from false. In Buddhist context, *sāra* often refers to liberation (*nibbāna*), wisdom (*paññā*), and virtue (*sīla*)—what truly conduces to well-being. The verse emphasizes *ñatvā* (having known)—this isn't blind faith but experiential discrimination. Buddhist practice trains this discernment: learning to recognize what actually produces suffering and what produces freedom.

### Verses 13-14: The Poorly and Well-Thatched Roof

**Verse 13**

Just as rain penetrates a poorly thatched house,  
So passion penetrates an undeveloped mind.[13]

**Verse 14**

Just as rain does not penetrate a well-thatched house,  
So passion does not penetrate a well-developed mind.[14]

#### Footnotes

[13] **The Undeveloped Mind**: *Abhāvita citta* is the "un-cultured" or "undeveloped" mind—consciousness that hasn't been trained through meditation, ethical practice, and wisdom cultivation. Like a house with poor thatching (*ducchannaṁ*), it offers no protection when the rains (*vuṭṭhī*) of *rāga* (passion, lust, attachment) come. The metaphor is domestic and accessible: everyone knows a leaky roof means a miserable night. So too an untrained mind means suffering when desire strikes.

[14] **The Well-Developed Mind**: *Subhāvita citta* is the mind thoroughly cultivated (*bhāvita*) through Buddhist meditation practices—mindfulness (*sati*), concentration (*samādhi*), insight (*vipassanā*). Like a well-thatched roof (*succhannaṁ*), it protects consciousness from being flooded by passion. This is not suppression but training: desire may arise, but it doesn't "penetrate" (*samativijjhati*)—doesn't overwhelm, doesn't compel action, doesn't produce suffering. Mental development (*bhāvanā*) is Buddhism's core technology.

### Verses 15-16: Sorrow and Joy (Here and Hereafter)

**Verse 15**

Here they sorrow, hereafter they sorrow;  
The evildoer sorrows in both worlds.  
They sorrow, they are afflicted,  
Seeing the stain of their own deeds.[15]

**Verse 16**

Here they rejoice, hereafter they rejoice;  
The merit-maker rejoices in both worlds.  
They rejoice, they are overjoyed,  
Seeing the purity of their own deeds.[16]

#### Footnotes

[15] **Immediate and Future Consequences**: The structure *idha...pecca* ("here...hereafter") indicates both present and future consequences. *Pāpakārī* (the evildoer) experiences *soka* (sorrow, grief) in this life—the immediate psychological consequence of harmful action—and again after death. *Vihaññati* means "is tormented" or "afflicted." The phrase *kammakiliṭṭham attano* ("the stain/defilement of one's own deeds") emphasizes personal responsibility: we see clearly that we ourselves created this suffering through unwholesome action.

[16] **The Fruit of Merit**: *Katapuñña* (the merit-maker, one who has done wholesome deeds) experiences *modati* (joy, gladness) and *pamodati* (great joy, delight) both now and hereafter. *Kammavisuddhiṁ attano* ("the purity of one's own deeds") is the opposite of verse 15's stain—the clear conscience and well-being that naturally follow ethical action. These verses articulate karma as psychological law: wholesome action produces joy not through external reward but through its intrinsic effects on consciousness.

---

### Verses 17-18: Burning and Bliss (Here and Hereafter)

**Verse 17**

Here they burn, hereafter they burn;  
The evildoer burns in both worlds.  
"I have done evil"—with this they burn,  
And burn even more having gone to a bad destination.[17]

**Verse 18**

Here they rejoice, hereafter they rejoice;  
The merit-maker rejoices in both worlds.  
"I have done good"—with this they rejoice,  
And rejoice even more having gone to a good destination.[18]

#### Footnotes

[17] **Tappati—Burning**: *Tappati* means "to burn," "to be tormented," "to suffer intensely"—both from conscience (*"pāpaṁ me kataṁ"* = "Evil has been done by me") and from actual consequences (*duggatiṁ gato* = "gone to a bad destination"). The progression is ruthless: immediate psychological burning from guilt/shame, then intensified burning (*bhiyyo tappati*, "burns even more") in *duggati* (unfortunate rebirth). Whether understood literally (hell realms) or metaphorically (psychological states), the teaching is clear: harmful action creates compounding suffering.

[18] **Nandati—Rejoicing**: *Nandati* means "to rejoice," "to delight." The merit-maker experiences joy from the thought *"puññaṁ me kataṁ"* ("Good has been done by me")—not pride but the natural gladness of integrity—and even greater joy (*bhiyyo nandati*) in *suggati* (fortunate destination, happy rebirth). These verses (17-18) closely parallel 15-16 but emphasize the intensification of karmic results: temporary sorrow/joy here expands into profound burning/bliss hereafter.

---

### Verses 19-20: Recitation and True Practice

**Verse 19**

Though one may recite many sacred texts,  
If heedless and not practicing accordingly,  
Like a cowherd counting others' cattle,  
One has no share in the spiritual life.[19]

**Verse 20**

Though one may recite only a little of the texts,  
If one practices in accordance with the Dhamma,  
Having abandoned greed, hatred, and delusion,  
With rightly-knowing mind, well-liberated,  
Clinging to nothing here or hereafter—  
Such a one has a share in the spiritual life.[20]

#### Footnotes

[19] **Recitation Without Practice**: *Sahitaṁ* refers to sacred texts, the collected teachings. *Nara pamatto* is "a heedless person" who doesn't practice (*na takkaro*, "not a doer"). The simile is cutting: like a *gopa* (cowherd) who counts (*gaṇayaṁ*) cattle belonging to others (*paresaṁ*), the mere scholar has no ownership of wisdom. *Sāmaññassa* means "the spiritual/monastic life"—here, authentic spiritual attainment. Memorization without transformation is worthless; scholarship without practice is counting others' wealth.

[20] **Little Recitation, Much Practice**: Even minimal textual knowledge (*appam-pi ce sahitaṁ*) suffices if one is *anudhammacārī* (practicing in accordance with Dhamma). The verse then lists what constitutes true practice: abandoning (*pahāya*) the three roots of unwholesome action—*rāga* (greed/lust), *dosa* (hatred/aversion), *moha* (delusion/ignorance); possessing *sammappajāna* (right knowledge, clear comprehension); having *suvimuttacitto* (well-liberated mind); and being *anupādiyāna* (not clinging) to anything in this world or the next. This is the essence of Buddhism: not erudition but transformation, not belief but liberation. *Sa bhāgavā* ("such a one has a share")—this person genuinely participates in the fruits of the spiritual path.

### Historical Context

The Dhammapada likely reached its current form around the 3rd century BCE, though the verses themselves may preserve material from the Buddha's lifetime (circa 5th century BCE). It became one of the most widely translated Buddhist texts, with versions in Chinese, Tibetan, and numerous modern languages.
# Chapter 2: Appamādavagga (Heedfulness)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Appamādavagga

The second chapter of the Dhammapada treats *appamāda* (heedfulness, diligence, vigilance)—one of Buddhism's most essential practical teachings. The Buddha famously declared *appamāda* as "the path to the deathless" in his final words. This chapter establishes heedfulness as the foundation for all spiritual progress, the quality that distinguishes those advancing toward liberation from those stagnating in samsara.

The twelve verses progress from establishing heedfulness as the path to immortality (verse 21) through its cultivation and results (verses 22-29), culminating in its role in monastic practice and proximity to nibbāna (verses 30-32).

---

### Verses 21-22: Heedfulness as the Deathless State

**Verse 21**

Heedfulness is the deathless state; heedlessness, the state of death.  
The heedful do not die; the heedless are as if already dead.[1]

**Verse 22**

The wise, fully understanding this distinction regarding heedfulness,  
Rejoice in heedfulness, delighting in the domain of the Noble Ones.[2]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Amata and Maccu**: *Amatapadaṁ* (the deathless state) and *maccuno padaṁ* (death's domain) establish a stark dichotomy. *Amata* refers not merely to physical immortality but to *nibbāna*—the deathless because it transcends birth and death entirely. The heedful "do not die" (*na mīyanti*) because they are progressing toward that deathless state; the heedless are "as if dead" (*yathā matā*) because they remain trapped in the cycle of death and rebirth. This verse echoes the Buddha's final teaching: "All conditioned things are subject to decay. Strive on with heedfulness" (*appamādena sampādetha*).

[2] **The Noble Domain**: *Ariyānaṁ gocarā* (the domain/pasture of the Noble Ones) refers to the mental and behavioral territory of those who have realized the noble truths. To "delight" (*ratā*) in this domain is to find genuine pleasure in the practices—meditation, ethical conduct, wisdom cultivation—that characterize the noble life. The verse shows heedfulness not as grim duty but as source of joy (*pamodanti*) for those who understand its significance.

---

### Verse 23: The Fruit of Meditative Practice

**Verse 23**

Those meditators, constant in practice,  
Always firm in their exertion—  
Those wise ones experience Nibbāna,  
The unsurpassed release from all bonds.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Jhāyino and Yogakkhema**: *Jhāyino* (meditators) refers to those engaged in *jhāna* (meditative absorption), though the term broadly includes all forms of meditation practice. *Sātatikā* (constant, persistent) and *daḷhaparakkamā* (firm in exertion) emphasize sustained effort—liberation requires not occasional practice but unbroken continuity. *Yogakkhema* (release from bonds, security from bondage) is a synonym for *nibbāna*, emphasizing freedom from the "yokes" (*yoga*) of sensual desire, becoming, views, and ignorance. The term *phusanti* ("touch," "experience") suggests direct realization, not mere intellectual understanding.

---

### Verse 24: The Growth of Fame Through Heedfulness

**Verse 24**

For one who is active, mindful,  
Pure in deeds, considerate,  
Self-controlled, living in accord with Dhamma,  
Heedful—for such a one, reputation greatly increases.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **Qualities of the Heedful**: This verse lists six interrelated qualities: (1) *uṭṭhānavato* (active, energetic), (2) *satīmato* (mindful), (3) *sucikammassa* (pure in deeds), (4) *nisammakārino* (considerate, thoughtful in action), (5) *saññatassa* (self-controlled, restrained), (6) *dhammajīvino* (living by dhamma). These aren't arbitrary virtues but interdependent aspects of heedfulness. *Yasobhivaḍḍhati* (fame/reputation greatly increases) might seem to contradict Buddhist non-attachment, but *yasa* here means the natural consequence of virtue—a good reputation that inspires others and facilitates teaching, not ego-driven status-seeking.

---

### Verse 25: The Island Against the Flood

**Verse 25**

Through activity, heedfulness,  
Through self-control and restraint,  
The sage should make an island  
That no flood can overwhelm.[5]

#### Footnotes

[5] **The Island Metaphor**: *Dīpaṁ kayirātha* ("make an island") employs one of Buddhism's most powerful metaphors. In a land threatened by monsoon floods, an island represents security, refuge, higher ground. The "flood" (*ogha*) is the torrent of sam sāra—sensual desire, becoming, views, ignorance—that sweeps away the unprepared. The verse teaches that liberation isn't bestowed externally but must be *made* (*kayirātha*) through one's own effort. The Buddha's famous declaration "Be islands unto yourselves" echoes this teaching. The four qualities listed—activity (*uṭṭhāna*), heedfulness (*appamāda*), self-control (*saṁyama*), restraint (*dama*)—are the materials for constructing this refuge.

---

### Verses 26-27: Wise and Foolish Approaches

**Verse 26**

Foolish, unintelligent people cultivate heedlessness;  
The wise one guards heedfulness like supreme treasure.[6]

**Verse 27**

Do not cultivate heedlessness, do not be intimate with sensual pleasure.  
The heedful meditator surely attains abundant happiness.[7]

#### Footnotes

[6] **Treasure Guarding**: The contrast couldn't be starker: fools (*bālā dummedhino*—lacking wisdom and intelligence) "cultivate" (*anuyuñjanti*) heedlessness as their practice, while the wise (*medhāvī*) "guards" (*rakkhati*) heedfulness like *dhanaṁ seṭṭhaṁ* (supreme wealth, greatest treasure). This inverts conventional values: what the world calls "living it up" (heedless pursuit of pleasure) Buddhism identifies as poverty; what appears as difficult discipline (heedfulness) is actually supreme wealth.

[7] **Warning Against Heedlessness**: The prescriptive *mā* (do not) gives this verse urgency. *Kāmaratisanthavaṁ* (intimacy/acquaintance with sensual delight) specifies what heedlessness looks like in practice—not occasional sense pleasure but habitual indulgence (*santhava* implies close association). The counterproposal—heedful meditation—leads to *vipulaṁ sukhaṁ* (abundant, expansive happiness), qualitatively different from sensual pleasure's fleeting satisfaction.

---

### Verse 28: The Palace of Wisdom

**Verse 28**

When the wise one drives out heedlessness with heedfulness,  
Ascending the palace of wisdom, free from grief,  
He observes the grieving people—  
The wise one on the mountain looking down at fools on the plain.[8]

#### Footnotes

[8] **Ascending Perspectives**: This verse develops sophisticated imagery. *Nudati* (eliminates, drives out) shows heedfulness not as adding something new but removing obscuration—like clouds clearing to reveal the sun. *Paññāpāsāda* (palace of wisdom) suggests both elevation and nobility; wisdom isn't cramped quarters but spacious dwelling. *Asoko* (griefless) describes the wise one's state—not callousness but freedom from the grief born of clinging. The mountain/plain simile (*pabbataṭṭho va bhummaṭṭhe*) illustrates perspectival shift: from wisdom's elevation, the wise see clearly what fools, absorbed in lowland concerns, cannot perceive. This isn't arrogance (*avekkhati* means "looks upon" not "looks down on" pejoratively) but clear seeing of relative positions on the path.

---

### Verse 29: The Swift Horse

**Verse 29**

Heedful among the heedless, wakeful among the sleeping,  
The true sage advances, leaving behind the weak horse  
As a swift horse outdistances it.[9]

#### Footnotes

[9] **Horse Metaphor**: *Sīghassa* (swift horse) versus *abalassa* (weak horse) captures the acceleration that heedfulness produces. While others sleep (*suttesu*, literally "among the sleeping ones"), the heedful remains *bahujāgaro* (greatly wakeful, vigilant). *Hitvā yāti* (having left behind, moves on) suggests not competition but natural consequence—the diligent practitioner simply pulls ahead. This verse anticipates later Buddhist thought about "sudden" versus "gradual" enlightenment: while the path requires time, heedfulness creates momentum that can feel like quantum leaps.

---

### Verse 30: Maghavā's Attainment

**Verse 30**

Through heedfulness, Maghavā attained supremacy among the gods.  
People praise heedfulness; heedlessness is always blamed.[10]

[10] **Maghavā (Sakka)**: Maghavā, also known as Sakka, is the king of the Tāvatiṁsa heaven in Buddhist cosmology. According to tradition, he attained this exalted position not through power or birth but through heedful practice as a human. This verse makes a crucial point: even divine status results from heedfulness, not grace or fate. *Pasaṁsanti* (praise) and *garahito* (blamed) show unanimous assessment—across cultures and traditions, diligence is valued and negligence condemned. This verse argues that *appamāda*'s importance isn't sectarian doctrine but universal wisdom.

### Verses 31-32: The Monastic and Nibbāna

**Verse 31**

A monastic delighting in heedfulness, seeing danger in heedlessness,  
Advances like fire consuming the fetters, small and large.[11]

**Verse 32**

A monastic delighting in heedfulness, seeing danger in heedlessness,  
Cannot fall away—that one is in Nibbāna's presence.[12]

#### Footnotes

[11] **Fire Consuming Fetters**: *Saṁyojana* (fetters) are the ten bonds that keep beings tied to samsara: self-view, doubt, clinging to rites and rituals, sensual desire, ill-will, desire for form existence, desire for formless existence, conceit, restlessness, ignorance. *Aṇuṁ-thūlaṁ* (small and large, subtle and gross) acknowledges these fetters' varying strengths. *Ḍahaṁ aggīva* (like burning fire) is a powerful image—heedfulness doesn't gently untie bonds but consumes them through insight's heat. *Gacchati* (goes, advances) shows this as active movement toward freedom.

[12] **Impossibility of Falling Away**: *Abhabbo parihānāya* (unable to fall away, incapable of decline) makes a strong claim—the truly heedful monastic has reached irreversibility. This connects to the Buddhist concept of *sotāpanna* (stream-enterer), one who has entered the stream flowing inevitably to nibbāna. *Nibbānasseva santike* (in Nibbāna's very presence, well-nigh to Nibbāna) suggests proximity but not full arrival—echoing the traditional scheme of four paths and fruits. The verse ends the chapter on ultimate purpose: heedfulness leads not merely to better rebirth but to liberation itself.

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Key Concepts

1. **Appamāda**: Heedfulness as active vigilance—not mere absence of negligence but sustained, energetic attention to the path
2. **Amata**: The deathless state (nibbāna) contrasted with the "living death" of heedless existence
3. **Island-Making**: Spiritual practice as constructing refuge through one's own effort
4. **Gradual Progress**: Heedfulness produces both quantum leaps (verse 29) and steady advance (verses 31-32)

### Cross-References

- **Buddha's Final Words**: "All conditioned things decay. Strive on with heedfulness" (*Mahāparinibbāna Sutta*)
- **Satipaṭṭhāna**: Mindfulness practices that operationalize heedfulness
- **Four Right Efforts**: Systematic cultivation of wholesome states (parallel to verses 26-27's prescriptions)
- **Ten Fetters**: Detailed in verse 31's imagery of fire consuming bonds

### Historical Context

The emphasis on *appamāda* reflects early Buddhism's practical orientation. Rather than metaphysical speculation, the Buddha prescribed methodical mental training—heedfulness being both method and result.
# Chapter 3: Cittavagga (The Mind)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Cittavagga

The third chapter addresses *citta* (mind)—the fundamental arena of Buddhist training. While Chapter 1 established mind as the creator of experience and Chapter 2 emphasized heedfulness, this chapter examines the mind itself: its wildness, its danger when misdirected, its power when trained, and its ultimate potential for liberation.

The eleven verses progress from vivid images of the untrained mind (fish out of water, flitting bird) through the discipline of mental restraint to the transformative insight that a well-directed mind surpasses any gift that relatives could give.

---

### Verses 33-34: The Untrained Mind

**Verse 33**

An agitated, unsteady mind,  
Difficult to guard, difficult to ward—  
The sagacious one makes straight,  
As a fletcher straightens an arrow.[1]

**Verse 34**

Like a fish thrown upon dry land,  
Pulled from its watery home,  
This mind thrashes about—  
Therefore, throw off Māra's dominion.[2]

#### Footnotes

[1] **The Fletcher Metaphor**: *Phandanaṁ capalaṁ* (agitated, unsteady) describes the untrained mind's constant motion. The fletcher (*usukāra*) metaphor appears throughout early Buddhist literature—the skilled craftsman straightening the arrow shaft represents the meditator's patient, skilled work of aligning the mind. Neither forceful nor passive, it requires sustained attention.

[2] **The Fish Metaphor**: *Vārijo va thale khitto* ("like a fish thrown on dry land") powerfully evokes the mind's distress when removed from its habitual element (sense-pleasure) and exposed to the "dry land" of renunciation and restraint. *Māradheyya* (Māra's dominion/sway) is where the unrestrained mind lives. The verse urges practitioners to use this very agitation as motivation to break free.

---

### Verses 35-36: Restraining the Subtle Mind

**Verse 35**

For the mind that is difficult to subdue,  
Flighty, flitting wherever it will—  
Restraint is good; a restrained mind brings happiness.[3]

**Verse 36**

Hard to see, very subtle,  
Flitting wherever it desires—  
The sage should guard the mind;  
A guarded mind brings happiness.[4]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Difficulty and Reward**: *Dunniggaha* (difficult to subdue) and *lahuna* (flighty, light) characterize the untrained mind. *Yatthakāmanipātina* ("flitting wherever it will") captures mental wandering. The verse's conclusion is striking in its simplicity: restraint (*damatha*) leads to happiness (*sukhāvaha*). This contradicts the untrained mind's assumption that freedom from restraint equals happiness.

[4] **The Invisible Factor**: *Sududdasa* (hard to see) and *sunipuṇa* (very subtle) acknowledge mind's elusive nature—we can observe its contents more easily than the observer itself. Yet this subtle, nearly invisible process determines our entire experience. *Gutta* (guarded) parallels *danta* (restrained) from verse 35, establishing the dual practice of protection and training.

---

### Verse 37: Release from Māra's Bonds

**Verse 37**

Those who will restrain the mind  
That roams far, wanders alone,  
Bodiless, hidden in the cave—  
They gain release from Māra's bonds.[5]

#### Footnotes

[5] **Mind's Peculiar Nature**: Four qualities characterize mind: *dūraṅgama* (far-roaming—mind travels instantly to distant places and times), *ekacara* (wandering alone—each person's mind is radically private), *asarīra* (bodiless—has no physical form), *guhāsaya* (hidden in a cave—the "cave" is the heart or head, indicating mind's concealment). *Mārabandhanā* (Māra's bonds) are the bonds of death, desire, and delusion. Those who tame this elusive thing gain liberation.

---

### Verses 38-39: Unsettled and Settled Minds

**Verse 38**

For one whose mind is unsettled,  
Who does not know the True Dhamma,  
Whose confidence wavers—  
Wisdom is never fulfilled.[6]

**Verse 39**

For one whose mind is free from lust,  
Whose heart is unperplexed,  
Who has abandoned both merit and demerit—  
For the watchful one, there is no fear.[7]

#### Footnotes

[6] **Three Interdependent Deficiencies**: *Anavaṭṭhitacitta* (unsettled mind) leads to *avijānato saddhammaṁ* (not knowing true Dhamma), which produces *pariplavapasāda* (wavering confidence). The result: *paññā na paripūrati* (wisdom is unfulfilled). This verse shows how mental instability prevents spiritual development—not through moral failing but through the simple inability to sustain attention long enough to understand.

[7] **The Fearless State**: *Anavassutacitta* (free from lust—literally "not flowing out" toward objects) and *ananvāhatacetaso* (unperplexed, not struck by confusion). Most striking is *puññapāpapahīnassa*—having abandoned both merit and demerit. This represents the arahat state, beyond karma accumulation. For such a one (*jāgarato*, "the watchful/awakened"), fear has no basis. There is nothing left to lose or protect.

---

### Verse 40: The Jar and the Fortress

**Verse 40**

Knowing this body is frail like a jar,  
Establishing the mind like a fortress,  
Fight Māra with wisdom's weapon—  
Guard your success, remain unattached.[8]

#### Footnotes

[8] **Two Metaphors, Two Strategies**: The body (*kāya*) is compared to a *kumbha* (clay jar)—fragile, easily broken, temporary. But the mind (*citta*) can be established like a *nagara* (fortress, citadel)—defensible, protected, strong. The verse prescribes combat: *yodhetha Māraṁ* ("fight Māra") with *paññāvudha* ("wisdom's weapon"). The final injunction—*anivesano siyā* ("remain unattached")—prevents spiritual materialism: don't cling even to your spiritual victories.

---

### Verse 41: The Body's Fate

**Verse 41**

Before long, alas, this body  
Will lie upon the ground,  
Rejected, without consciousness,  
Like a useless piece of wood.[9]

#### Footnotes

[9] **Memento Mori**: *Aciraṁ* (before long, soon) emphasizes urgency—death approaches everyone. *Chuddho* (rejected, cast aside) and *apetaviññāṇo* (without consciousness, bereft of awareness) describe the corpse. The simile *niratthaṁ va kaliṅgaraṁ* ("like a useless piece of wood") is brutally deflationary—the body we cherish will become garbage. This contemplation, far from morbid, motivates practice: time is limited.

---

### Verses 42-43: The Mind's Power for Harm and Good

**Verse 42**

Whatever an aggressor does to an aggressor,  
Or an enemy to an enemy—  
A wrongly-directed mind  
Can do far worse than that to him.[10]

**Verse 43**

Not mother, not father,  
Nor any other relative  
Could do as much for him  
As a rightly-directed mind.[11]

#### Footnotes

[10] **Self-Harm Through Mental Misdirection**: External enemies can harm the body, reputation, possessions. But *micchāpaṇihitaṁ cittaṁ* (a wrongly-directed mind) damages something more fundamental—it creates the karma that determines future suffering across lifetimes. The comparison to aggressor and enemy highlights this: no outer foe matches the danger of one's own untrained mind.

[11] **Self-Help Through Mental Alignment**: The parallel structure underscores the mind's positive potential. *Mātā pitā* (mother and father) and *aññe ñātakā* (other relatives) represent those who love and support us most. Yet even their best efforts cannot benefit us as much as *sammāpaṇihitaṁ cittaṁ* (a rightly-directed mind). Liberation—the ultimate benefit—only we can give ourselves through mental training.

**End of Cittavagga (Chapter 3)**

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Key Concepts

1. **Citta**: Mind as the trainable factor—not fixed consciousness but malleable process
2. **Mind Similes**: Arrow, fish, bird, fortress, hidden dweller—capturing different aspects
3. **Damatha/Gutta**: Restraint and guarding—active protection of mental states
4. **Micchāpaṇihita/Sammāpaṇihita**: Wrongly-directed vs. rightly-directed mind—the crucial variable

### Cross-References

# Chapter 4: Pupphavagga (Flowers)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Pupphavagga

The fourth chapter employs flower imagery throughout—a natural metaphor in Indian culture where flowers adorned temples, marked transitions, and symbolized impermanence. The Buddha uses flowers to illuminate teachings on discernment (verses 44-45), impermanence (46-48), ethical conduct (49-53), virtue's superior fragrance (54-56), and the lotus arising from mud (58-59).

---

### Verses 44-45: Who Will Know This Earth?

**Verse 44**

Who will know this earth  
And the realm below, together with the gods?  
Who will reflect upon the well-taught verse of Dhamma  
As a skilled person reflects upon a flower?

**Verse 45**

The trainee will know this earth  
And the realm below, together with the gods.  
The trainee will reflect upon the well-taught verse of Dhamma  
As a skilled person reflects upon a flower.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Sekha (The Trainee)**: The *sekha* is one who has entered the path but not yet attained arahatship—still "in training." The flower-reflection metaphor (*kusalo puppham-ivappacessati*) suggests skilled discernment: just as a florist selects the right blooms, the trainee discerns Dhamma verses with practiced wisdom. The rhetorical question-and-answer structure creates memorable teaching.

---

### Verse 46: Body as Froth

**Verse 46**

Knowing this body is like froth,  
Understanding it has a mirage's nature,  
Cutting off Māra's flower-tipped arrows,  
One should go beyond the King of Death's sight.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **Multiple Images**: *Pheṇūpama* (like foam/froth) emphasizes the body's insubstantiality—seemingly solid but collapsing upon examination. *Marīcidhamma* (mirage-nature) adds deception to insubstantiality. *Papupphakāni* ("flower-adorned")—Māra's arrows are tipped with flowers, seductive but deadly. Seeing through all three deceptions leads beyond Death's dominion.

---

### Verses 47-48: Death and the Flower-Gatherer

**Verse 47**

Death takes up and carries away  
The one whose mind is attached to gathering flowers,  
Like a great flood carries off a sleeping village.

**Verse 48**

The End-Maker takes control of the one  
Whose mind is attached to gathering flowers—  
Unsated, still hungering for sense pleasures.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Flower-Gathering as Distraction**: *Pupphāni pacinanta* (gathering flowers) represents sense-pleasure pursuit—beautiful, absorbing, ultimately fatal. *Byāsattamanasa* (attached mind) is the danger. The sleeping village (*suttaṁ gāmaṁ*) image emphasizes unpreparedness—death arrives while we're distracted. *Atittaṁ yeva kāmesu* (unsated in sense-pleasures) shows the tragedy: death comes before desire is ever satisfied.

---

### Verse 49: The Bee and the Sage

**Verse 49**

Just as a bee, without hurting  
The flower, its color or scent,  
Gathers nectar and departs—  
So should the sage move through the village.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **The Mendicant's Model**: The bee (*bhamara*) takes what it needs without damaging the source. *Aheṭhayaṁ* (without harming) is key—the sage on alms-round receives offerings without depleting the giver or becoming attached. *Gāme munī care* (the sage should roam in the village) prescribes non-harmful sustenance-seeking.

---

### Verse 50: Focus on Oneself

**Verse 50**

Not others' wrongs nor what others have done or left undone  
Should one consider,  
But what one has done and left undone oneself.[5]

#### Footnotes

[5] **Self-Examination Over Judgment**: *Na paresaṁ vilomāni* (not others' wrongs)—the untrained mind obsesses over others' failures. But *attano va avekkheyya* (one should consider one's own)—spiritual progress requires self-examination. This verse directly counters gossip, judgment, and comparative thinking.

---

### Verses 51-52: Flowers With and Without Fragrance

**Verse 51**

Just like a beautiful flower  
With color but lacking fragrance,  
So are well-spoken words fruitless  
For one who does not act on them.

**Verse 52**

Just like a beautiful flower  
With color and with fragrance,  
So are well-spoken words fruitful  
For one who does act on them.[6]

#### Footnotes

[6] **Words and Deeds**: The classic twin-verse structure contrasts *agandhakaṁ* (without fragrance) and *sagandhakaṁ* (with fragrance). Beautiful words without corresponding action are like scentless flowers—pretty but lacking essence. *Akubbato* (not doing) versus *pakubbato* (doing)—the difference between spiritual decoration and transformation.

---

### Verse 53: Making Garlands

**Verse 53**

Just as from a heap of flowers  
One might make many garlands,  
So should many good deeds be done  
By one born mortal.[7]

#### Footnotes

[7] **Human Life as Opportunity**: *Puppharāsi* (heap of flowers) represents available opportunities. *Mālāguṇe bahū* (many garlands)—skilled work transforms raw materials into something beautiful. *Jātena maccena* (one born mortal) emphasizes human life's preciousness: we have limited time to make merit before the flowers wilt.

---

### Verses 54-56: The Fragrance of Virtue

**Verse 54**

Flower fragrance goes not against the wind—  
Not sandalwood, pinwheel, or jasmine.  
But virtue's fragrance goes against the wind;  
The true person's fragrance permeates all directions.

**Verse 55**

Sandalwood, pinwheel, water lily, jasmine—  
Among these fragrances,  
Virtue's fragrance is unsurpassed.

**Verse 56**

Pinwheel and sandalwood fragrance are insignificant;  
But the fragrance of one with virtue  
Rises supreme among the gods.[8]

#### Footnotes

[8] **Virtue Transcends Physics**: Physical fragrances obey wind direction; *sīlagandha* (virtue's fragrance) defies this, spreading *sabbā disā* (in all directions), even *paṭivātam* (against the wind). Three verses progressively intensify: virtue's fragrance surpasses all natural fragrances, rises to the gods, is *anuttara* (unsurpassed). This teaches that moral excellence has effects beyond local and physical causation.

---

### Verse 57: Māra Cannot Find the Path

**Verse 57**

For those endowed with virtue,  
Living heedfully,  
Freed through perfect knowledge—  
Māra cannot find their path.[9]

#### Footnotes

[9] **Invisibility to Evil**: *Sampannasīla* (endowed with virtue), *appamādavihāri* (living heedfully), *sammad-aññāvimutta* (freed through right knowledge)—three qualities make one invisible to *Māra*. The liberating insight cuts the thread Māra would follow. This verse links back to Chapter 2's heedfulness teaching.

---

### Verses 58-59: The Lotus in the Garbage Heap

**Verse 58-59**

Just as on a garbage heap  
Discarded by the highway  
A lotus might arise—  
Pure-scented, delighting the mind—

So among the forsaken,  
Among blind ordinary folk,  
The Buddha's disciple outshines  
Through wisdom.[10]

#### Footnotes

[10] **The Lotus Image**: *Saṅkāradhāna* (garbage heap/rubbish pile) along the *mahāpatha* (highway) is the world of ordinary defilement. Yet *padumaṁ* (lotus)—ancient India's supreme flower—arises there, *sucigandhaṁ manoramaṁ* (pure-scented, mind-delighting). *Andhabhūta puthujjana* (blind ordinary folk) contrasts with *Sammāsambuddhasāvako* (disciple of the Perfectly Awakened One) who *atirocati paññāya* (outshines through wisdom). The lotus-in-mud is Buddhism's beloved image: awakening emerges from samsara, not despite conditions but through them.

---

**End of Pupphavagga (Chapter 4)**
# Chapter 5: Bālavagga (Fools)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Bālavagga

The fifth chapter addresses *bāla* (the fool)—one whose actions and attitudes obstruct spiritual progress. This isn't intellectual deficiency but willful ignorance, inability to learn from experience, and self-destructive behavior. The chapter pairs naturally with Chapter 6 (Paṇḍitavagga—The Wise), creating a contrast between those who advance and those who stagnate.

---

### Verse 60: Long is the Night

**Verse 60**

Long is the night for one awake;  
Long is a league for one exhausted;  
Long is the round of rebirths for fools  
Who know not the True Dhamma.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Three Lengths**: The verse builds from minor discomfort (sleepless night), to physical exhaustion (long journey), to existential tragedy (*saṁsāra*—endless rebirths). *Avijānataṁ* (not knowing) is key: the fool's suffering extends because they refuse the teaching that would end it. All sufferings feel long to those who lack liberating understanding.

---

### Verse 61: No Friendship with Fools

**Verse 61**

If while traveling one cannot find  
Someone better or equal to oneself,  
One should firmly resolve to go alone:  
There is no friendship with fools.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **Spiritual Solitude**: *Ekacariyaṁ daḷhaṁ kayirā* (firmly resolve to go alone) isn't arrogance but self-preservation. *Natthi bāle sahāyatā* (no friendship with fools) warns that bad companions drag one down. Better loneliness than corrupting companionship. This verse echoes the solitary elephant metaphor later (verse 330).

---

### Verse 62: Nothing Truly Ours

**Verse 62**

"Sons are mine, riches are mine"—  
So the fool suffers vexation.  
When even self is not one's own,  
How then sons? How then riches?[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **The Ownership Delusion**: The quoted speech captures the fool's claim: *puttā matthi, dhanam matthi* (sons are mine, riches are mine). But *attā hi attano natthi* (even self is not one's own)—Buddhism's radical challenge to possession. If the "I" that supposedly owns things is itself impermanent and ownerless, what can truly belong to it?

---

### Verse 63: Knowing One's Foolishness

**Verse 63**

A fool who knows his foolishness  
Is at least wise in that;  
But a fool proud of his wisdom—  
He is called a fool indeed.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **The Meta-Wisdom**: *Maññati bālyaṁ* (knows his foolishness) is the beginning of wisdom—recognizing ignorance. *Paṇḍitamānī* (proud of wisdom, thinking oneself wise) is the real danger: the fool who believes himself wise cannot learn. Socrates' insight echoes here: knowing one knows nothing is the start of knowledge.

---

### Verses 64-65: The Spoon and the Tongue

**Verse 64**

Even if a fool attends on a wise man  
For his entire life,  
He does not learn Dhamma—  
As a spoon learns not the taste of curry.

**Verse 65**

If a perceptive person attends on a wise man  
Even for a moment,  
He quickly learns Dhamma—  
As the tongue learns the taste of curry.[5]

#### Footnotes

[5] **The Famous Spoon Simile**: *Dabbī sūparasaṁ yathā* (as a spoon the taste of curry)—despite constant immersion in curry, the spoon never tastes it. Mere proximity to wisdom means nothing without receptivity. *Viññū* (the perceptive one) contrasts with *bālo* (fool): capacity to learn (*vijānāti*) determines results, not duration of exposure.

---

### Verse 66: Self-Enmity

**Verse 66**

Stupid fools live with themselves as their own enemies,  
Committing wicked deeds  
That produce bitter fruit.[6]

#### Footnotes

[6] **Self-Sabotage**: *Amitteneva attanā* (with themselves as enemy) captures the fool's tragedy—their worst enemy is not external but internal. Every *pāpakaṁ kammaṁ* (wicked deed) generates *kaṭukapphala* (bitter fruit). The fool attacks themselves through their own actions.

---

### Verses 67-68: Regret and Relief

**Verse 67**

That deed is not well done  
Which, having done, one regrets—  
For which one has tears on one's face  
As the result follows round.

**Verse 68**

That deed is well done  
Which, having done, one does not regret—  
For which one is pleased and happy  
As the result follows round.[7]

#### Footnotes

[7] **Internal Criterion**: This twin-verse pair offers a practical test: *anutappati* (regret) marks bad deeds; *nānutappati* (no regret) marks good ones. *Vipākaṁ paṭisevati* (the result follows round)—karma's consequences pursue us. The tearful face versus the happy heart measure our actions' quality.

---

### Verse 69: Sweet Until Ripening

**Verse 69**

The fool thinks (wickedness) is sweet  
As long as it does not ripen;  
But when the wicked deed ripens,  
The fool undergoes suffering.[8]

#### Footnotes

[8] **Delayed Consequences**: *Madhuvā maññati* (thinks it sweet)—evil feels pleasurable before results manifest. *Paccati* (ripens, cooks) is the key verb: karma ripens like fruit, ferments like wine. The initial sweetness is deceptive; the fool doesn't see the bitterness coming.

---

### Verse 70: Asceticism Without Understanding

**Verse 70**

Month by month the fool may eat  
With the tip of kusa grass;  
Yet he is not worth a sixteenth part  
Of those who have understood Dhamma.[9]

#### Footnotes

[9] **Austerity Versus Insight**: *Kusaggena* (with the tip of kusa grass) refers to extreme fasting—an ascetic practice eating almost nothing. But *saṅkhātadhamma* (those who have mastered/understood Dhamma) are *soḷasī* (sixteen times) more valuable. This verse attacks asceticism without wisdom: mere physical discipline without insight achieves nothing.

---

### Verse 71: Fire Under Ashes

**Verse 71**

A wicked deed once done  
Does not curdle at once, like milk.  
Smoldering, it follows the fool  
Like fire covered with ashes.[10]

#### Footnotes

[10] **Hidden Combustion**: Two images: milk doesn't turn instantly (*sajju khīraṁ va muccati*), and fire smoldering under ashes (*bhasmacchanno va pāvako*). Both capture karma's delayed action—evil seems dormant but is slowly ripening, quietly burning, waiting to consume. *Ḍahanta* (smoldering) emphasizes the hidden danger.

---

### Verses 72-75: Learning That Destroys

**Verse 72**

Whatever learning arises for a fool,  
It is only to his disadvantage—  
It destroys his good fortune  
And destroys his head.[11]

#### Footnotes

[11] **Dangerous Knowledge**: *Ñattaṁ* (learning, knowledge) in wrong hands becomes destructive. *Anatthāya* (to disadvantage) inverts knowledge's purpose. *Muddham-assa vipātayaṁ* (destroys his head) suggests both literal danger and metaphorical downfall. Misused learning is worse than ignorance.

---

### Verses 73-74: The Fool's Desires

**Verses 73-74**

He may wish for undeserved respect,  
Status among monastics,  
Control in living quarters,  
Worship from good families:

"Householders and renunciants alike  
Should think this was done by me;  
Let them all be under my sway  
In matters done and not done."

So thinks the fool—  
His desires and conceit only increase.[12]

#### Footnotes

[12] **Spiritual Materialism**: These verses expose the fool in monastic robes. *Asataṁ bhāvana* (respect that is lacking/undeserved), *purekkhāra* (status), *issariya* (control)—all worldly ambitions dressed in spiritual clothing. *Icchā māno ca vaḍḍhati* (desires and conceit increase)—the opposite of genuine progress.

---

### Verse 75: Two Paths

**Verse 75**

The means to gains is one thing;  
The path to Nibbāna, another.  
Understanding this, the Buddha's monastic disciple  
Should not delight in honors  
But cultivate solitude.[13]

#### Footnotes

[13] **Definitive Distinction**: *Lābhūpanisā* (means to gains) versus *Nibbānagāminī* (path going to Nibbāna)—two entirely different directions. *Sakkāraṁ nābhinandeyya* (should not delight in honors) prescribes renunciation of prestige. *Vivekam-anubrūhaye* (cultivate solitude) offers the alternative: not worldly success but meditative seclusion.

---

**End of Bālavagga (Chapter 5)**
# Chapter 6: Paṇḍitavagga (The Wise)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Paṇḍitavagga

The sixth chapter presents *paṇḍita* (the wise)—the counterpart to Chapter 5's fool. If the fool refuses to learn, the wise person actively seeks correction. If the fool is shaken by circumstances, the wise stands firm like rock. Fourteen verses outline the wise person's companions, qualities, equanimity, and ultimate liberation.

---

### Verses 76-78: The Wise Choose Companions Carefully

**Verse 76**

One should regard someone who reveals your faults  
As one who points out hidden treasure.  
Keep company with such a sagacious person who reproves you—  
For doing so is better, not worse.[1]

**Verse 77**

One should advise and instruct,  
And forbid whatever is vile.  
Such a one is dear to the good,  
But not dear to the bad.[2]

**Verse 78**

Do not keep company with wicked friends,  
Do not keep company with the ignoble.  
Keep company with spiritual friends,  
Keep company with superior people.[3]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Fault-Finders as Treasure**: *Nidhīnaṁ va pavattāra* (like one who points out treasure). Most flee criticism; the wise seek it. One who shows our faults (*vajjadassi*) performs a valuable service—revealing what we could not see alone. *Seyyo hoti na pāpiyo* (surely better, not worse) emphasizes the paradox.

[2] **The Good Teacher's Unpopularity**: The one who advises (*ovadeyya*), instructs (*anusāseyya*), and forbids wrong (*asabbhā nivāraye*) is *piyo* (dear) to the good (*santa*) but *appiyo* (not dear) to the bad. Genuine teachers make enemies among those who prefer flattery.

[3] **Kalyāṇamitta (Spiritual Friend)**: *Mitte kalyāṇe* (spiritual friends) is a technical term in Buddhism—the Buddha declared *kalyāṇamittatā* (spiritual friendship) to be "the whole of the holy life." The fourfold structure (*na bhaje...na bhaje...bhajetha...bhajetha*) emphasizes active choice: avoid the wicked twice, seek the good twice.

### Verses 79-80: Drinking Dhamma, Mastering Self

**Verse 79**

One who drinks Dhamma lives well,  
With a clear mind;  
The wise one always delights  
In the Dhamma made known by the Noble Ones.[4]

**Verse 80**

Course-makers lead water;  
Fletchers straighten arrows;  
Carpenters straighten wood;  
The wise master themselves.[5]

#### Footnotes

[4] **Dhammapīti (Drinking Dhamma)**: *Pīti* (drinking, absorbing) suggests deep internalization—not intellectual study but drinking in wisdom as one drinks water. *Vippasannena cetasā* (with clear mind)—the result is mental clarity, not confusion.

[5] **Craftsmen's Training**: Three craftsmen metaphors show training's universality: *nettikā* lead water, *usukārā* straighten arrows, *tacchakā* shape wood. The climax: *attānaṁ damayanti paṇḍitā* (the wise master themselves). The self is the ultimate material requiring skillful shaping.

---

### Verses 81-82: Rock and Lake

**Verse 81**

Just as solid rock is not shaken by the wind,  
So the wise are not moved by blame or praise.[6]

**Verse 82**

Like a lake that is deep, clear, and unruffled,  
So the wise become calm after hearing Dhamma.[7]

#### Footnotes

[6] **The Rock Simile**: *Selo yathā ekaghano* (like solid, single-mass rock). *Nindāpasaṁsā* (blame and praise) are two of the eight worldly winds (*lokadhamma*—gain/loss, fame/infamy, praise/blame, pleasure/pain). The wise remain *na samiñjanti* (unmoved, unshaken) by either.

[7] **The Lake Simile**: *Rahado gambhīro vippasanno anāvilo* (deep, clear, unruffled lake) conveys the wise mind's quality—not shallow reactivity but deep stability. *Vippasīdanti* (become clear/confident) after hearing Dhamma, rather than stirred up.

---

### Verse 83: Equanimity in All Conditions

**Verse 83**

True people everywhere renounce;  
The good do not chatter about sense desires.  
When touched by pleasure or suffering,  
The wise show neither elation nor depression.[8]

#### Footnotes

[8] **Transcending Pairs**: *Sabbattha cajanti* (renounce everywhere)—not attachment to any situation. *Sukhena phuṭṭhā atha vā dukhena* (touched by pleasure or suffering) describes inevitable experience; *n'occāvacaṁ dassayanti* (show neither ups nor downs) describes the wise response. Equanimity is the hallmark.

---

### Verse 84: Neither for Self nor Other

**Verse 84**

Not for one's own sake nor another's  
Should one desire child, riches, or kingdom.  
One should not desire success through corruption;  
One should be virtuous, wise, and righteous.[9]

#### Footnotes

[9] **Comprehensive Renunciation**: *Na attahetu na parassa hetu* (not for self, not for other) eliminates both selfishness and misguided altruism as motivations. The list—child (*putta*), riches (*dhana*), kingdom (*raṭṭha*)—covers family, wealth, power. *Adhammena samiddhi* (success through corruption) is specifically rejected.

---

### Verses 85-86: Few Cross to the Other Shore

**Verse 85**

Among humans, few go beyond;  
The rest run along the near shore.

**Verse 86**

Those who live righteously  
According to the well-taught Dhamma—  
They will go beyond Death's realm,  
So hard to cross.[10]

#### Footnotes

[10] **The River Crossing**: *Pāragāmino* (those who go beyond) is a classic image for liberation—crossing the river of samsara to *pāra* (the far shore, beyond). Most people (*itarā pajā*) merely *tīram evānudhāvati* (run along the bank)—busy but never crossing. *Maccudheyya suduttara* (Death's realm, very hard to cross) awaits most; only followers of Dhamma pass over.

---

### Verses 87-89: Renunciation and Liberation

**Verse 87**

Having abandoned the dark state,  
The wise one should develop the bright;  
Having gone from home to homelessness,  
In solitude, where delight is hard.[11]

**Verse 88**

One should desire to delight in that (solitude),  
Having given up sense pleasures, possessing nothing.  
The wise one should purify the self  
Of mental defilements.[12]

**Verse 89**

Those who have well-developed minds  
In the factors of complete awakening,  
Who delight in non-attachment,  
Having given up grasping—  
Pollutant-free, shining forth—  
They are emancipated in the world.[13]

#### Footnotes

[11] **The Difficult Solitude**: *Kaṇha dhamma* (dark state) versus *sukka* (bright)—the wise abandon one and develop the other. *Okā anoka* (from home to homelessness)—monastic renunciation. *Viveke yattha dūrama* (in solitude, where it is hard to delight)—honest acknowledgment that solitude is difficult, not romantic.

[12] **Purification Practice**: *Akiñcano* (possessing nothing) and *hitvā kāme* (having given up sense pleasures) are prerequisites for *pariyodapeyya attāna cittaklesehi* (purifying the self of mental defilements). The work is internal, not external.

[13] **The Shining Ones**: *Sambodhi-aṅgesu* (factors of awakening) are the seven factors: mindfulness, investigation, effort, rapture, tranquility, concentration, equanimity. *Khīṇāsava* (pollutant-free)—the āsavas (taints of sensuality, becoming, ignorance) are destroyed. *Jutimanto* (shining forth) and *parinibbutā* (emanicipated)—the final state of the wise.

**End of Paṇḍitavagga (Chapter 6)**
# Chapter 7: Arahantavagga (The Arahants)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Arahantavagga

The seventh chapter portrays the *arahant*—the "worthy one" who has completed the path, destroyed all defilements, and will not be reborn. These ten verses paint the arahat state through striking images: geese leaving a lake, birds leaving no track in sky, earth unmoved, city-post unshakeable. This is the goal toward which all earlier chapters point.

---

### Verse 90: No Consuming Fever

**Verse 90**

For one who has reached the goal,  
Who grieves not, released on all sides,  
Who has abandoned all the knots—  
No consuming fever is found.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **The Completed Journey**: *Gataddhino* (one who has reached the goal/end of the road) marks arrival. *Visoka* (griefless) and *vippamutta sabbadhi* (released on all sides) describe complete freedom. *Sabbaganthappahīna* (abandoned all knots)—the four *gantha* (knots: covetousness, ill-will, attachment to rites, dogmatism) are cut. *Pariḷāho* (consuming fever, burning)—the mental torment of craving—no longer exists.

---

### Verse 91: Geese Leaving the Lake

**Verse 91**

The mindful ones striving diligently  
Do not delight in dwelling places.  
Like geese who abandon a lake,  
They leave behind all fondness for homes.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **The Goose Migration**: *Haṁsā va pallalaṁ hitvā* (like geese who abandon a lake)—wild geese migrate without attachment to their temporary waters. *Okam-okaṁ jahanti* (they leave home after home)—the arahat moves on, never clinging to any dwelling. The image combines freedom with purposeful movement.

---

### Verses 92-93: Birds in the Sky

**Verse 92**

Those who have no stores,  
Who comprehend food aright,  
Whose resort is the liberation  
That is empty and signless—  
Like birds in the sky,  
Their track is hard to find.

**Verse 93**

For the one whose pollutants are destroyed,  
Who is not dependent on food,  
Whose resort is the liberation  
That is empty and signless—  
Like birds in the sky,  
His footprint is hard to find.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Trackless Flight**: *Ākāse va sakuntānaṁ gati durannayā* (like birds in the sky, their track is hard to find). Birds leave no permanent trace in the air; similarly, arahants leave no trace for Māra or rebirth to follow. *Suññato animitto vimokkho* (liberation that is empty and signless)—two of the three liberations (emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness) that characterize arahat consciousness. *Pariññātabhojanā* (comprehend food aright)—eating mindfully, without craving.

---

### Verse 94: Even Gods Envy

**Verse 94**

One whose senses are stilled,  
Like horses well-trained by a charioteer,  
Who has abandoned conceit,  
Who is without pollutants—  
Even the gods envy such a one.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **Divine Envy**: *Assā yathā sārathinā sudantā* (like horses well-trained by a charioteer)—sense faculties are the horses, mind is the charioteer. When properly trained, they obey perfectly. *Pahīnamāna* (abandoned conceit) and *anāsava* (without pollutants) describe complete purification. *Devā pi pihayanti* (even gods envy)—remarkable claim: celestial beings, for all their pleasure, cannot match the arahat's liberation. The gods are still bound; the arahat is free.

---

### Verse 95: Earth, Post, Lake

**Verse 95**

Untroubled like the earth,  
Steadfast like a city-post,  
Like a lake free from mud—  
Such a one continues not in births and deaths.[5]

#### Footnotes

[5] **Three Stability Images**: *Paṭhavisamo* (like the earth)—the earth accepts all, unmoved by what's poured on it. *Indakhīlūpama* (like a city-post/Indra's pillar)—the great post at a city gate, driven deep, immovable. *Rahado apetakaddamo* (lake free from mud)—clarity and purity. *Saṁsārā na bhavanti* (continues not in births and deaths)—the ultimate result: samsara ends.

---

### Verse 96: Triple Peace

**Verse 96**

His mind is calm,  
His speech is calm,  
His actions are calm—  
Liberated by right knowledge,  
Such a one is truly peaceful.[6]

#### Footnotes

[6] **Santa Triad**: *Santaṁ manaṁ, santā vācā, santaṁ kammaṁ* (calm mind, calm speech, calm action)—the three doors of activity are all pacified. *Sammad-aññāvimutta* (liberated by right knowledge)—not through ritual or luck but through direct insight. *Upasanta* (truly peaceful)—peace has perfused every aspect of being.

---

### Verse 97: The Supreme Person

**Verse 97**

The one beyond mere faith,  
Who knows the unmade,  
Who has cut off rebirth-linking,  
Who has destroyed the occasion,  
Who has thrown out hope and desire—  
This is truly the supreme person.[7]

#### Footnotes

[7] **Five Marks of Supremacy**: (1) *Assaddha* (beyond mere faith)—not faithless but beyond the need for faith, having direct knowledge; (2) *Akataññū* (knows the unmade)—knows nibbāna, the unconditioned; (3) *Sandhiccheda* (cut the link)—severed the connection to future rebirth; (4) *Hatāvakāso* (destroyed the occasion)—eliminated the conditions for further becoming; (5) *Vantāso* (thrown out hope/desire)—ejected all craving. *Uttamaporiso* (supreme person)—the arahat is humanity's highest possibility.

---

### Verse 98: Wherever They Live

**Verse 98**

Whether in village or wilderness,  
On low ground or high—  
Wherever the arahants dwell,  
That ground is delightful.[8]

#### Footnotes

[8] **Consecrated Ground**: *Gāme vā yadi vāraññe, ninne vā yadi vā thale* (village or wilderness, low or high)—the arahat's location doesn't matter. *Rāmaṇeyyakaṁ* (delightful, charming)—their presence transforms the place. This inverts our usual assumption that places make us happy; here, the person blesses the place.

---

### Verse 99: Delighting Where Others Cannot

**Verse 99**

The delightful wildernesses  
Where ordinary people find no delight—  
Those without passion will take joy there,  
For they seek not sense pleasures.[9]

#### Footnotes

[9] **Inverted Pleasures**: *Ramaṇīyāni araññāni* (delightful wildernesses)—the forest is objectively beautiful. *Yattha na ramatī jano* (where people find no delight)—ordinary people, craving stimulation, are bored. *Vītarāgā ramissanti* (those without passion delight)—the arahat, desiring nothing, can appreciate what is. *Na te kāmagavesino* (not seeking sense pleasures)—their joy doesn't depend on external gratification.

---

**End of Arahantavagga (Chapter 7)**
# Chapter 8: Sahassavagga (Thousands)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Sahassavagga

The eighth chapter develops a sustained argument through comparison: better one meaningful thing than thousands of meaningless things. The pattern "better one X than a thousand Y" applies to words, verses, victories, sacrifices, and even life-years. Quality over quantity; depth over breadth; a moment of insight over a lifetime of blindness.

---

### Verses 100-102: Words and Verses

**Verse 100**

Though there be a thousand sayings  
Consisting of useless words,  
Better is one useful word  
Hearing which one is brought to peace.

**Verse 101**

Though there be a thousand verses  
Consisting of useless words,  
Better is one word of verse  
Hearing which one is brought to peace.

**Verse 102**

One may speak a hundred verses  
Consisting of useless words,  
Better is one verse of Dhamma  
Hearing which one is brought to peace.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Quantity vs. Quality in Speech**: *Sahassa* (thousand) and *sata* (hundred) contrast with *eka* (one). *Anatthapadasaṁhitā* (consisting of useless/meaningless words) describes empty speech. *Upasammati* (brought to peace, calmed) is the criterion: words that pacify the mind are valuable regardless of quantity.

---

### Verses 103-105: Conquest of Self

**Verse 103**

One may conquer a thousand men  
A thousand times in battle—  
But conquering one's own self  
Is supreme in battle.

**Verses 104-105**

Conquest over self is better  
Than conquest over other people.  
For the person who restrains themselves,  
Who lives constantly well-controlled—  
Neither gods, nor gandhabbas,  
Nor Māra together with Brahmā,  
Can turn that victory into defeat.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **The Unconquerable Victory**: *Saṅgāmajuttamo* (supreme in battle) redefines conquest: not over armies but over oneself. *Attadanta* (self-restrained) and *niccaṁ saññatacāri* (constantly living controlled) describe the victor. The remarkable claim: even divine beings (*deva, gandhabba, Māra, Brahmā*) cannot reverse this victory. External conquests can always be undone; internal victory is permanent.

---

### Verses 106-108: Worship vs. Sacrifice

**Verse 106**

One might give alms monthly  
A thousand coins for a hundred years;  
Yet one who worships someone  
With developed self for a moment—  
That worship is better than the hundred-year sacrifice.

**Verse 107**

One might tend the sacred fire  
In the forest for a hundred years;  
Yet one who worships someone  
With developed self for a moment—  
That worship is better than the hundred-year sacrifice.

**Verse 108**

Whatever alms or sacrifice in the world  
The merit-seeker gives for a year—  
All that comes not to a quarter  
Of worshipping the upright.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Worthy Recipients**: *Bhāvitattāna* (one with developed self) is the worthy recipient. *Muhuttam-api* (even for a moment)—the briefest genuine worship surpasses years of undirected giving. The hundred-year sacrifice (*vassasataṁ hutaṁ*) represents maximum worldly religiosity; a moment's honor to a worthy person exceeds it.

---

### Verse 109: Four Benefits

**Verse 109**

For one who constantly worships honorable elders,  
Four things increase:  
Length of life, beauty, happiness, and strength.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **Concrete Benefits**: *Abhivādanasīli* (habit of worshipping) and *vaddhāpacāyi* (honoring elders/seniors) are the practices. *Āyu, vaṇṇa, sukha, bala* (life, beauty, happiness, strength) are the four benefits—practical, worldly goods arising from spiritual practice.

---

### Verses 110-115: One Day vs. A Hundred Years

**Verse 110**

One might live a hundred years  
Unvirtuous and uncomposed—  
Better is one day of life  
For one with virtue and meditation.

**Verse 111**

One might live a hundred years  
Lacking wisdom and uncomposed—  
Better is one day of life  
For one with wisdom and meditation.

**Verse 112**

One might live a hundred years  
Indolent, with weak energy—  
Better is one day of life  
For one whose energy is firm.

**Verse 113**

One might live a hundred years  
Without seeing rise and fall—  
Better is one day of life  
For one who sees rise and fall.

**Verse 114**

One might live a hundred years  
Without seeing the deathless state—  
Better is one day of life  
For one who sees the deathless state.

**Verse 115**

One might live a hundred years  
Without seeing the supreme Dhamma—  
Better is one day of life  
For one who sees the supreme Dhamma.[5]

#### Footnotes

[5] **The Better Day**: Six parallel verses value quality over quantity in life itself. *Vassasataṁ jīve* (live a hundred years) contrasts with *ekāhaṁ jīvitaṁ* (one day's life). The criteria: virtue, wisdom, energy, seeing impermanence (*udayabbaya*—rise and fall), seeing the deathless (*amataṁ padaṁ*), seeing supreme Dhamma. A single day with any of these exceeds a century without.

---

**End of Sahassavagga (Chapter 8)**
# Chapter 9: Pāpavagga (Evil)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Pāpavagga

The ninth chapter addresses *pāpa* (evil, wickedness)—not as demonic force but as harmful action that accumulates consequences. Key teachings: hasten to good, avoid repetition of evil, karma ripens gradually like water drops filling a pot, and nowhere on earth can one hide from consequences.

---

### Verses 116-118: Speed Toward Good, Away from Evil

**Verse 116**

Hasten to do wholesome deeds;  
Ward the mind from wickedness.  
For the mind slow in meriting  
Delights in wickedness.[1]

**Verse 117**

Should someone do an evil deed,  
They should not do it again and again.  
Let them not set their intention there—  
Suffering accumulates for the wicked.

**Verse 118**

Should someone do a good deed,  
They should do it again and again.  
Let them set their intention there—  
Joy accumulates for one who makes merit.[2]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Urgency for Good**: *Abhittharetha* (hasten, be quick) conveys urgency—good deeds need not wait. *Dandhaṁ karato* (one slow in making merit)—delay is dangerous because the untrained mind naturally inclines toward wickedness.

[2] **Accumulation Principle**: Twin verses contrast *pāpa* (wickedness) and *puñña* (merit). *Punappunaṁ* (again and again)—repetition builds momentum. *Chanda* (intention)—where we place intention matters. *Uccaya* (accumulation)—karma builds up, for suffering or joy.

---

### Verses 119-120: Delayed Ripening

**Verse 119**

Even the wicked one experiences good fortune  
While the wickedness does not ripen;  
But when the wickedness ripens,  
The wicked one experiences wicked results.

**Verse 120**

Even the fortunate one experiences misfortune  
While the good fortune does not ripen;  
But when the good fortune ripens,  
The fortunate one experiences good results.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Karmic Delay**: *Paccati* (ripens, cooks)—karma matures like fruit. Current experience doesn't always match current actions because of time lag. The wicked may prosper temporarily; the good may suffer temporarily. But eventual ripening is certain.

---

### Verses 121-122: Water Drops Fill the Pot

**Verse 121**

Do not dismiss wickedness thinking,  
"It will not come to me."  
Through the falling of water drops  
The water pot is filled.  
The fool, gathering bit by bit,  
Becomes full of wickedness.

**Verse 122**

Do not dismiss merit thinking,  
"It will not come to me."  
Through the falling of water drops  
The water pot is filled.  
The wise one, gathering bit by bit,  
Becomes full of merit.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **The Water Drop Simile**: *Udabindunipātena udakumbho pūrati* (through falling drops the pot fills). Each drop seems insignificant; together they fill the vessel. *Thokaṁ thokam-pi ācinaṁ* (gathering bit by bit)—both evil and good accumulate through small repetitions. Never dismiss an action as too small to matter.

---

### Verses 123-124: Avoiding Poison

**Verse 123**

Like a merchant on a dangerous road,  
With few companions and great wealth,  
Like one loving life avoiding poison—  
So should one avoid wicked deeds.

**Verse 124**

If there is no wound in the hand,  
One can carry poison in the palm.  
Poison does not enter without a wound;  
No evil results for one who does no wrong.[5]

#### Footnotes

[5] **The Poison Simile**: *Visaṁ jīvitukāmo va* (like one loving life [avoiding] poison)—the instinct for self-preservation applied to karma. The wound metaphor is subtle: *nābbaṇaṁ visam-anveti* (poison doesn't enter without wound). If there's no opening for evil (no evil deed), no bad result can "enter."

---

### Verse 125: Dust Against the Wind

**Verse 125**

One who offends against an inoffensive person,  
A purified, passionless one—  
That wicked deed returns to the fool  
Like fine dust thrown against the wind.[6]

#### Footnotes

[6] **Karmic Boomerang**: *Sukhumo rajo paṭivātaṁ va khitto* (like fine dust thrown against the wind). Attacking the pure backfires completely—the harm returns to the attacker. *Appaduṭṭha* (inoffensive), *suddha* (purified), *anaṅgaṇa* (passionless) describe one who cannot be karmically harmed.

---

### Verse 126: Four Destinies

**Verse 126**

Some are reborn in the womb;  
Evildoers go to the underworld;  
The righteous go to heaven;  
Those without pollutants attain complete liberation.[7]

#### Footnotes

[7] **Rebirth Destinations**: Four possibilities: (1) *gabbha* (womb)—human realm; (2) *niraya* (underworld/hell)—for evildoers; (3) *sagga* (heaven)—for the righteous; (4) *parinibbāna* (complete liberation)—for those *anāsavā* (pollutant-free). This verse maps karma to rebirth.

---

### Verses 127-128: Nowhere to Hide

**Verse 127**

Neither in the sky, nor in mid-ocean,  
Nor entering a mountain cave—  
There is no place on earth  
Where one can escape wicked deeds.

**Verse 128**

Neither in the sky, nor in mid-ocean,  
Nor entering a mountain cave—  
There is no place on earth  
Where death will not overcome one.[8]

#### Footnotes

[8] **Inescapable Consequences**: The parallel structure emphasizes: *na vijjatī so jagatippadeso* (no place on earth exists) where one can hide from karma or from death. *Antalikkhe* (sky), *samuddamajjhe* (mid-ocean), *pabbatānaṁ vivaraṁ* (mountain cleft)—nowhere is safe. The universe has no hiding places.

---

**End of Pāpavagga (Chapter 9)**
# Chapter 10: Daṇḍavagga (Violence / The Rod)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Daṇḍavagga

The tenth chapter addresses *daṇḍa* (the rod/stick)—violence, punishment, and harm. Opening with Buddhism's ethical core (all tremble at violence, all love life), it progresses through consequences of harm and the path of nonviolence. The broken gong simile and ten punishments passage are particularly memorable.

---

### Verses 129-130: All Tremble at Violence

**Verse 129**

Everyone trembles at violence;  
Everyone fears death.  
Comparing oneself with others,  
One should not strike or have others strike.

**Verse 130**

Everyone trembles at violence;  
For everyone, life is dear.  
Comparing oneself with others,  
One should not strike or have others strike.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Buddhism's Golden Rule**: *Attānaṁ upamaṁ katvā* (comparing oneself with others) is the practical method—feel how you would feel, then act accordingly. *Na haneyya na ghātaye* (don't strike, don't have struck)—both direct violence and commissioning violence are forbidden. The near-identical verses emphasize universality through repetition.

---

### Verses 131-132: Harm Brings No Happiness

**Verse 131**

One who harms with the rod  
Beings who desire happiness,  
While seeking happiness for oneself,  
Will find no happiness after death.

**Verse 132**

One who harms not with the rod  
Beings who desire happiness,  
While seeking happiness for oneself,  
Will find happiness after death.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **The Happiness Paradox**: All beings are *sukhakāmā* (desiring happiness). Harming them while seeking your own happiness is self-defeating: *pecca so na labhate sukhaṁ* (won't find happiness after death). The twin verses create stark contrast: harm → no happiness; nonharm → happiness.

---

### Verses 133-134: Harsh Speech and the Broken Gong

**Verse 133**

Speak no harsh word to anyone;  
Spoken to, they may answer back.  
Arrogant talk brings misery,  
And they may strike you with the rod.

**Verse 134**

If you make no sound  
Like a broken gong,  
You have attained Nibbāna—  
Contention is not found in you.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **The Broken Gong**: *Kaṁso upahato* (broken gong) produces no sound when struck. The practitioner who doesn't "resound" with anger when struck has *pattosi Nibbānaṁ* (attained Nibbāna), having eliminated *sārambha* (contention, quarrelsomeness). This is active nonreactivity, not suppression.

---

### Verse 135: Old Age and Death Drive Us

**Verse 135**

As a cowherd with a stick  
Drives cattle to pasture,  
So do old age and death  
Drive life out of beings.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **The Cowherd Simile**: *Gopālo gāvo pāceti gocaraṁ* (cowherd drives cattle to pasture)—inevitable, methodical, relentless. *Jarā ca maccu ca* (old age and death) similarly drive all beings toward their end. This is not fatalism but motivation: awareness of death encourages ethical urgency.

---

### Verses 137-140: Ten Punishments for Violence

**Verses 137-140**

Whoever with the rod offends  
Those who are inoffensive and harmless  
Will quickly fall into one of ten states:

Harsh physical pain;  
Loss of wealth;  
Bodily breakdown;  
Heavy affliction;  
Loss of mind;  
Danger from the king;  
Terrible slander;  
Loss of relatives;  
Destruction of possessions;  
Houses consumed by fire.

And at death, that foolish one  
Arises in the underworld.[5]

#### Footnotes

[5] **Karma's Specific Fruits**: Ten consequences for harming the harmless: *vedanā pharusā* (harsh feelings/pain), *jāni* (loss), *sarīrassa bhedana* (bodily breakdown), *garuka ābādha* (heavy affliction), *cittakkhep* (mental breakdown), *rājato upassagga* (royal danger), *abbhakkhāna* (slander), *ñātīnaṁ parikkhaya* (loss of kin), *bhogānaṁ pabhaṅgura* (wealth destruction), *aggi ḍahati agārāni* (fire burns houses). Plus rebirth in the underworld.

### Verses 141-142: True Purification

**Verse 141**

Not going naked, nor matted hair, nor mud,  
Nor fasting, nor lying on stony ground,  
Nor dust and dirt, nor squatting exertions  
Can purify one who has not removed doubt.

**Verse 142**

Even if adorned, if one is peaceful,  
Trained, settled, living the holy life,  
Having laid down the rod toward all beings—  
That one is a brahmin, an ascetic, a monastic.[6]

#### Footnotes

[6] **External vs. Internal Markers**: Verse 141 lists ascetic practices that don't purify: nakedness, matted hair, mud, fasting, lying on stones, dust, squatting. Verse 142 offers the counterpoint: even wearing ornaments, one who is *santo danto* (peaceful, trained) and *nidhāya daṇḍaṁ sabbesu bhūtesu* (has laid down the rod toward all beings) is the true renunciant.

### Verses 143-145: The Good Horse

**Verse 143**

Rare is the person in this world  
Who is restrained by conscience,  
Aware of their faults—  
Like a good horse restrained by the whip.

**Verse 144**

Like a good horse touched by the whip,  
Be ardent and spiritually intense.  
With faith, virtue, energy,  
Concentration, and Dhamma investigation—  
With understanding, good conduct, and mindfulness—  
Abandon this not-insignificant suffering.

**Verse 145**

Course-makers lead water;  
Fletchers straighten arrows;  
Carpenters straighten wood;  
The mild master themselves.[7]

#### Footnotes

[7] **Self-Mastery**: The horse metaphor returns: a good horse needs only the lightest touch. The verse lists *saddhā, sīla, viriya, samādhi, dhammavinicchaya* (faith, virtue, energy, concentration, Dhamma investigation)—essentially the five faculties. Verse 145 repeats the craftsmen metaphor from Chapter 6: *subbatā attānaṁ damayanti* (the mild master themselves).

# Chapter 11: Jarāvagga (Old Age)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Jarāvagga

The eleventh chapter confronts *jarā* (old age/decay). The body is a fortress of bones plastered with flesh; royal chariots decay; those who waste youth become like herons in a fishless lake. Most significantly, this chapter contains the Buddha's enlightenment poem (verses 153-154): "O Housebuilder, now you are seen!"

---

### Verse 146: Why Laughter?

**Verse 146**

Why this laughter, why this joy,  
When the world is constantly burning?  
Enveloped in darkness,  
Why do you not seek a light?[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Wake-Up Call**: *Ko nu hāso, kim ānando* (why laughter, why joy)—not anti-joy but perspective-shaking. The world *niccaṁ pajjalite* (constantly burning) with the three fires of greed, hatred, delusion. *Padīpaṁ na gavesatha* (why not seek a light?)—the Dhamma is the light.

---

### Verses 147-150: This Decaying Body

**Verse 147**

See this beautified puppet,  
A heap of sores raised up—  
Sick, imagined in many ways,  
With nothing stable or firm.

**Verse 148**

This body is worn out,  
A nest of disease, perishing.  
The putrid body comes to destruction—  
Life ends in death.

**Verse 149**

Like white gourds discarded in autumn  
Are these grey bones.  
Seeing them, why is there delight?

**Verse 150**

This fortress is made of bones,  
Plastered over with flesh and blood.  
But hidden within lie old age,  
Death, conceit, and anger.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **Contemplation of the Body**: Four verses progressively disenchant us from the body. *Bimba* (puppet/manikin) suggests something made-up. *Roganīḷa* (nest of disease) and *pūtisandeho* (putrid accumulation) are visceral. The bone-fortress simile shows the body's structure, with inner enemies (*jarā, maccu, māna, makkha*) hiding within.

---

### Verses 151-152: What Decays and What Doesn't

**Verse 151**

Decorated royal chariots decay,  
And the body also decays.  
But the Dhamma of the good does not decay—  
The good pass it to the good.

**Verse 152**

The person of little learning  
Grows old like an ox:  
His flesh increases,  
But his wisdom does not.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Two Trajectories**: Verse 151 contrasts perishable things (chariots, bodies) with imperishable Dhamma. Verse 152 offers a warning: *balivaddo va jīrati* (grows old like an ox)—the unlearned person gets physically larger but not wiser. *Maṁsāni vaḍḍhanti, paññā na vaḍḍhati* (flesh increases, wisdom doesn't).

---

### Verses 153-154: The Housebuilder

**Verse 153**

Through the round of countless births and deaths  
I have wandered without finding  
The housebuilder I was seeking—  
Born and suffering again and again.

**Verse 154**

O Housebuilder, now you are seen!  
You will not build the house again.  
All your rafters are broken,  
The ridgepole destroyed.  
My mind has reached the unconditioned;  
The end of craving has been achieved.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **The Buddha's Enlightenment Poem**: These two verses are traditionally the Buddha's first utterance after enlightenment. *Gahakāraka* (housebuilder) is *taṇhā* (craving) that constructs the house of rebirth. *Phāsukā bhaggā* (rafters broken) and *gahakūṭaṁ visaṅkhitaṁ* (ridgepole destroyed) mean the conditions for rebirth are demolished. *Visaṅkhāragataṁ cittaṁ* (mind reached the unconditioned)—nibbāna attained. *Taṇhānaṁ khayam-ajjhagā* (craving's end achieved)—liberation complete.

---

### Verses 155-156: Wasted Youth

**Verse 155**

Not having lived the holy life,  
Not having gained wealth in youth,  
They waste away like herons  
In a small lake devoid of fish.

**Verse 156**

Not having lived the holy life,  
Not having gained wealth in youth,  
They lie like spent arrows,  
Wailing about the past.[5]

#### Footnotes

[5] **Two Regrets**: Neither spiritual (*brahmacariya*) nor worldly (*dhana*) accomplishment in youth leads to pitiful old age. *Jiṇṇakoñcā* (old herons) in a *khīṇamacche pallale* (fishless puddle) captures helpless hunger. *Cāpātikhittā* (spent arrows) suggests exhausted energy. *Purāṇāni anutthunaṁ* (wailing about the past)—regret without remedy.

---

**End of Jarāvagga (Chapter 11)**
# Chapter 12: Attavagga (The Self)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Attavagga

The twelfth chapter addresses *attā* (self)—not metaphysical self-theory but practical self-responsibility. The teaching is radical: no one can purify another; by oneself is evil done, by oneself is one defiled, by oneself is one purified. The self is simultaneously one's own worst enemy and best friend.

---

### Verses 157-160: Self as Guardian and Friend

**Verse 157**

If one regards oneself as dear,  
One should guard oneself well.  
During one of the three watches of night,  
The wise one should stay alert.

**Verse 158**

First establish oneself in what is suitable,  
Then advise another.  
The wise one should not be defiled.

**Verse 159**

One should do oneself as one advises another.  
Being well-trained, one can train others—  
For the self is difficult to train.

**Verse 160**

The self is the friend of self—  
What other friend would there be?  
When the self is well-trained,  
One finds a friend hard to find.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Self-Reliance**: *Attā hi attano nātho* (self is the friend/protector of self). This isn't selfishness but self-responsibility. *Ko hi nātho paro siyā* (what other friend would there be?)—ultimately, no one can do the work for you. *Sudantena nāthaṁ labhati dullabhaṁ* (when well-trained, one finds a rare friend)—the trained self becomes one's own best companion.

---

### Verses 161-162: Self-Destruction

**Verse 161**

Evil done by oneself,  
Born in oneself, arising in oneself,  
Crushes the stupid one  
As a diamond crushes a rock-jewel.

**Verse 162**

One covered with exceeding lack of virtue,  
Like a deadly creeper on a Sāl tree,  
Makes oneself become  
What one's enemy wishes.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **Self-Inflicted Harm**: *Attanā va kataṁ pāpaṁ* (evil done by oneself) crushes oneself—external enemies unnecessary. The diamond crushing a gem simile shows the hardness of self-generated karma. The *māluvā* (strangling vine) on the *sāla* (Sāl tree) is an ancient Indian image: the vine eventually kills its host.

---

### Verses 163-165: The Great Teaching on Self-Purification

**Verse 163**

Easy to do are things not good,  
Unbeneficial for oneself.  
But that which is beneficial and good  
Is supremely hard to do.

**Verse 164**

Whoever reviles the noble teaching  
Of the Arahants who live by Dhamma,  
That stupid one, depending on wicked views,  
Brings about his own destruction—  
Like bamboo that bears fruit.

**Verse 165**

By oneself alone is evil done;  
By oneself is one defiled.  
By oneself alone is evil not done;  
By oneself is one purified.  
Purity and impurity come from oneself—  
No one can purify another.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Radical Self-Responsibility**: *Suddhī asuddhī paccattaṁ, nāñño aññaṁ visodhaye* (purity and impurity are one's own; no one can purify another). This is Buddhism's most radical ethical statement. No savior, no external purification—each person must do the work themselves. The bamboo simile: some bamboo species die after fruiting; reviling Dhamma brings similar self-destruction.

---

### Verse 166: Know Your Own Good

**Verse 166**

One should not neglect one's own good  
For another's, however great.  
Knowing what is good for oneself,  
One should be intent on that good.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **Prioritized Self-Care**: *Atta-d-atthaṁ paratthena bahunā pi na hāpaye* (don't neglect your own good for another's, however great). This isn't selfishness—it's recognizing that without self-cultivation, you cannot help others. Establish yourself first, then help others (verse 158).

---

**End of Attavagga (Chapter 12)**
# Chapter 13: Lokavagga (The World)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Lokavagga

The thirteenth chapter addresses *loka* (the world)—its nature, dangers, and how to see through it. The world is a bubble, a mirage, a gilded chariot where fools become depressed. Yet one who was heedless but becomes heedful shines like the moon breaking through clouds. The chapter culminates with stream-entry being superior to world sovereignty.

---

### Verses 167-169: Living by Dhamma

**Verse 167**

One should not follow lowly things,  
One should not abide heedlessly,  
One should not follow wrong view,  
One should not foster worldliness.

**Verse 168-169**

One should strive, not be heedless,  
Live by Dhamma with good conduct.  
Living by Dhamma, one lives at ease  
In this world and the next.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **The Dhammacārī**: *Hīna dhamma* (lowly things) and *micchādiṭṭhi* (wrong view) are to be avoided. *Lokavaḍḍhano* (fostering worldliness) keeps one trapped. The repeated refrain *asmiṁ loke paramhi ca* (in this world and the next) emphasizes that ethical living pays dividends everywhere.

---

### Verses 170-171: Bubble, Mirage, Gilded Chariot

**Verse 170**

See it as a bubble,  
See it as a mirage—  
Looking on the world in this way,  
The King of Death does not see one.

**Verse 171**

Come, look upon this world  
Adorned like a king's gilded chariot—  
Where fools become depressed.  
There is no bond for those who understand.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **Seeing Through Illusion**: *Bubbuḷaka* (bubble) and *marīcikā* (mirage) are classic impermanence images—both appear solid but are empty. *Rājarathūpama* (like a king's chariot)—the world's glamour is beautiful but binding. *Bālā visīdanti* (fools become depressed) when it inevitably fails. *Natthi saṅgo vijānataṁ* (no bond for those who understand)—insight liberates.

---

### Verses 172-173: Moon Breaking Through Clouds

**Verse 172**

Whoever was heedless before  
But later becomes not heedless—  
That one shines brightly on this world  
Like the moon released from a cloud.

**Verse 173**

One whose wicked deed done  
Is covered over by doing good—  
That one shines brightly on this world  
Like the moon released from a cloud.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Transformation and Redemption**: *Abbhā mutto va candimā* (like moon released from cloud) appears twice. Past heedlessness (*pubbe pamajjitvā*) or past evil (*pāpaṁ kataṁ kammaṁ*) can be overcome. The cloud obscures but doesn't destroy the moon—the luminous nature remains and can be revealed.

---

### Verses 174-175: Few Escape, Few Fly

**Verse 174**

This world is blind;  
Few here have true insight.  
As few go to heaven  
As birds that escape from the net.

**Verse 175**

Geese go through the path of the sky;  
They go through the firmament by their power.  
The wise are led out of the world  
After defeating Māra and his host.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **Movement Upward**: *Andhabhūto ayaṁ loko* (this world is blind). *Sakunto jālamutto va* (like birds escaping the net)—few achieve liberation. *Haṁsādiccapathe yanti* (geese go through the sun's path)—high fliers. *Nīyanti dhīrā lokamhā, jetvā Māraṁ savāhanaṁ* (the wise are led out, defeating Māra and his host)—liberation as victory.

---

### Verses 176-177: The Liar and the Miser

**Verse 176**

For the person speaking falsely,  
Who has transgressed in this one thing,  
Who has abandoned the next world—  
There is no wickedness left undone.

**Verse 177**

The miserly go not to the world of the gods;  
Fools surely do not praise giving.  
But the wise one rejoices in giving  
And through that is happy hereafter.[5]

#### Footnotes

[5] **Two Obstacles**: Lying (*musāvāda*) destroys ethical foundation: once truth is abandoned, all wickedness follows. Miserliness (*kadariya*) blocks heaven. *Dhīro dānaṁ anumodamāno* (the wise rejoice in giving)—generosity leads to happiness here and hereafter.

---

### Verse 178: Better Than World Sovereignty

**Verse 178**

Having sole sovereignty over the earth,  
Or going to heaven,  
Or lordship over the whole world—  
Better is the fruit of stream-entry.[6]

#### Footnotes

[6] **The Value of Stream-Entry**: *Pathavyā ekarajjena* (sole sovereignty over earth), *saggassa gamanena* (going to heaven), *sabbalokādhipaccena* (lordship over all worlds)—maximum worldly success. Yet *sotāpattiphalaṁ varaṁ* (better is stream-entry fruit). Stream-entry (*sotāpatti*) is the first stage of enlightenment, guaranteeing no more than seven rebirths and never in lower realms—infinitely superior to any worldly gain.

---

**End of Lokavagga (Chapter 13)**
# Chapter 14: Buddhavagga (The Buddha)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Buddhavagga

The fourteenth chapter praises the Buddha and his teaching. It includes the famous refuge verses (188-192), the "four rare things" (182), and the teaching summary verse (183). The chapter establishes the Buddha's unique qualities and the value of taking refuge in the Triple Gem.

---

### Verses 179-180: The Pathless One

**Verse 179-180**

He whose victory cannot be undone,  
Whose victory no one in the world approaches,  
The Buddha, whose range is endless,  
The pathless one—by what path can you lead him?

He who has no ensnaring craving  
To lead him anywhere—  
The Buddha, whose range is endless,  
The pathless one—by what path can you lead him?[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Beyond Paths**: *Jitaṁ nāvajīyati* (victory that cannot be undone). *Anantagocara* (endless range) describes the Buddha's unlimited scope. *Apada* (pathless, without track)—like birds in sky, the Buddha leaves no trace for others to follow back. *Kena padena nessatha* (by what path can you lead?)—rhetorical: the liberated one cannot be led by desire.

---

### Verses 181-182: Divine Envy and Four Rare Things

**Verse 181**

Those wise ones intent on meditation,  
Who delight in the peace of renunciation—  
Even the gods are envious of them,  
The Fully Awakened Ones, the mindful.

**Verse 182**

Rare is birth as a human;  
Rare is the life of mortals;  
Rare is hearing the True Dhamma;  
Rare is the arising of Buddhas.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **Four Rarities**: *Kiccha* (rare, difficult to obtain) applies to: human birth, mortal life, hearing Dhamma, Buddha's arising. This "four rarities" teaching emphasizes our extraordinary opportunity—wasting it is tragedy.

---

### Verse 183: The Teaching of All Buddhas

**Verse 183**

The non-doing of any wickedness,  
The undertaking of what is good,  
The purification of one's own mind—  
This is the teaching of the Buddhas.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **The Ovāda Pāṭimokkha**: *Sabbapāpassa akaraṇaṁ, kusalassa upasampadā, sacittapariyodapanaṁ*—the famous three-part summary of all Buddha's teaching. Avoid evil, do good, purify the mind. Simple to state, lifetimes to accomplish.

---

### Verses 184-185: Non-Harm and Practice

**Verse 184**

Enduring patience is the supreme austerity.  
Nibbāna is supreme, say the Buddhas.  
One gone forth does not hurt another;  
An ascetic does not harass another.

**Verse 185**

Not finding fault, not hurting,  
Restraint by the discipline,  
Knowing the right measure of food,  
Living in a remote dwelling,  
Devotion to meditation—  
This is the teaching of the Buddhas.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **The Monastic Path**: *Khantī paramaṁ tapo* (patience is supreme austerity)—not self-torture but forbearance. The six guidelines: non-fault-finding, non-hurting, discipline, moderation in food, secluded dwelling, meditation practice.

---

### Verses 186-187: No Satisfaction in Pleasures

**Verse 186-187**

Not through a rain of coins  
Is satisfaction found in sense pleasures.  
The wise one knows: "Sense pleasures  
Have little joy and much suffering."  
Not even in heavenly pleasures  
Does that one find delight.  
The disciple of the Fully Awakened One  
Delights in craving's destruction.[5]

#### Footnotes

[5] **Beyond Pleasure**: *Kahāpaṇavassena* (rain of coins)—unlimited wealth cannot satisfy craving. *Appassādā dukhā kāmā* (sense pleasures have little joy, much suffering)—the Buddha's diagnosis. Even *dibbesu kāmesu* (heavenly pleasures) don't satisfy the wise. *Taṇhakkhayarato* (delighting in craving's destruction)—the Buddha's solution.

---

### Verses 188-192: The Three Refuges

**Verse 188**

Many people shaken by fear  
Go for refuge to mountains and forests,  
To tree-shrines in pleasure parks.

**Verses 189-192**

That is not a secure refuge;  
That is not the supreme refuge;  
Coming to that refuge  
Does not liberate from all suffering.

But whoever has gone for refuge  
To the Buddha, the Dhamma, and the Sangha,  
And sees with right wisdom  
The Four Noble Truths:

Suffering, the arising of suffering,  
The overcoming of suffering,  
The Noble Eightfold Path  
Leading to the stilling of suffering—

THAT is a secure refuge;  
THAT is the supreme refuge.  
Coming to that refuge  
Liberates from all suffering.[6]

#### Footnotes

[6] **The Triple Gem**: The famous refuge formula. Mountains and forests don't liberate; Buddha, Dhamma, Sangha do. But refuge is not passive faith—it includes *sammappaññāya passati* (seeing with right wisdom) the Four Noble Truths.

---

### Verses 193-196: The Buddha's Arising

**Verse 193**

A person of noble breed is rare,  
Not born everywhere.  
Wherever that wise one is born,  
That family gains happiness.

**Verse 194**

Good is the arising of Buddhas;  
Good is the teaching of True Dhamma;  
Good is the harmony of the Sangha;  
Good is devotion to harmony.

**Verses 195-196**

Those who worship the worthy—  
Whether Buddhas or disciples,  
Who have overcome impediments,  
Crossed over grief and lamentation—

For those who worship such fearless ones,  
The emancipated—  
No one can measure their merit.[7]

#### Footnotes

[7] **Immeasurable Merit**: The chapter ends with praise of those who honor the awakened. *Na sakkā puññaṁ saṅkhātuṁ* (no one can count the merit)—worshipping the liberated generates incalculable good.

---

**End of Buddhavagga (Chapter 14)**
# Chapter 15: Sukhavagga (Happiness)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Sukhavagga

The fifteenth chapter explores *sukha* (happiness)—true happiness versus false, lasting versus fleeting. The famous "let us live happily" refrain opens the chapter. Key teachings: peace is supreme happiness; health is supreme gain; contentment is supreme wealth; Nibbāna is supreme good.

---

### Verses 197-200: Let Us Live Happily

**Verses 197-199**

Let us live truly happily,  
Without hatred among the hateful.  
Among humans who have hatred,  
Let us live without hatred.

Let us live truly happily,  
Without sickness among the sick.  
Among humans who are sick,  
Let us live without sickness.

Let us live truly happily,  
Without longing among those who long.  
Among humans who crave,  
Let us live without longing.

**Verse 200**

We live truly happily,  
We who have no possessions.  
We will feed on joy  
Like the gods of Streaming Light.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **The Triple Declaration**: *Susukhaṁ vata jīvāma* (we live truly happily) repeats as refrain. Three contrasts: *averino* (without hatred) among *verinesu* (the hateful); *anāturā* (without sickness) among *āturesu* (the sick); *anussukā* (without longing) among *ussukesu* (the longing). *Ābhassarā* (gods of Streaming Light) feed on *pīti* (joy) alone—the practitioner's model.

---

### Verses 201-204: Peace Is Supreme

**Verse 201**

The victor generates hatred;  
The defeated one finds suffering.  
The one at peace lives happily,  
Having abandoned victory and defeat.

**Verse 202**

There is no fire like passion,  
No offense like hatred,  
No suffering like the aggregates,  
No happiness beyond peace.

**Verse 203**

Hunger is the supreme sickness;  
Conditioned existence is the supreme suffering.  
Knowing this as it really is,  
Nibbāna is the supreme good.

**Verse 204**

Health is the supreme gain;  
Contentment is the supreme wealth;  
Confidence is the supreme kinship;  
Nibbāna is the supreme good.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **Supreme Things**: *Natthi santiparaṁ sukhaṁ* (no happiness beyond peace)—the chapter's core teaching. Verse 204's list: *ārogya* (health) as supreme gain; *santuṭṭhi* (contentment) as supreme wealth; *vissāsa* (confidence/trust) as supreme kinship; *Nibbānaṁ paramaṁ sukhaṁ* (Nibbāna is supreme good/happiness).

---

### Verses 205-208: The Taste of Dhamma

**Verse 205**

Savoring the taste of solitude,  
And the taste of peace—  
One becomes fearless, faultless,  
Drinking the joyful taste of Dhamma.

**Verses 206-207**

Meeting the noble is good;  
Living with them is always pleasant.  
Through not meeting fools  
One will constantly be happy.

He who consorts with fools  
Grieves for a long time.  
Dwelling with fools is suffering  
As with enemies always.  
The wise one dwells happily  
As with an assembly of kin.

**Verse 208**

Therefore, the firm, the wise, the learned,  
The virtuous, dutiful, noble—  
Accompany such a true, intelligent person  
As the moon accompanies the stars.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Companionship**: *Pavivekarasa* (taste of solitude) and *upasamassa rasa* (taste of peace) feed the practitioner. The extended teaching on companions: meet the noble, avoid fools. *Nakkhattapathaṁ va candimā* (as moon accompanies stars)—follow the noble like the moon follows its celestial path.

**End of Sukhavagga (Chapter 15)**
# Chapter 16: Piyavagga (What Is Dear)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Piyavagga

The sixteenth chapter examines *piya* (what is loved/dear)—the source of both joy and suffering. Through a powerful series of parallel verses, the Buddha traces grief and fear to their roots in love, fondness, delight, desire, and craving. Freedom from attachment means freedom from grief and fear.

---

### Verses 209-211: The Danger of Clinging

**Verse 209**

Engaging in what is not suitable,  
Not engaging in what is suitable,  
Abandoning the good, grasping what is loved—  
One envies those who apply themselves.

**Verse 210**

Do not associate with those you love  
Or with those you don't love—  
Suffering comes from not seeing the loved  
And suffering from seeing the unloved.

**Verse 211**

Therefore, hold nothing as dear;  
Losing what is loved is painful.  
There are no bonds for those  
Who hold nothing as loved or unloved.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **The Attachment Trap**: *Piyāpāyo hi pāpako* (losing what is loved is loathsome)—attachment guarantees eventual suffering. *Ganthā tesaṁ na vijjanti* (no knots for those) who have transcended both *piya* (loved) and *appiya* (unloved).

---

### Verses 212-216: The Five Sources of Grief and Fear

**Verse 212-216**

From love arises grief; from love arises fear.  
For one free from love, there is no grief—how could there be fear?

From fondness arises grief; from fondness arises fear.  
For one free from fondness, there is no grief—how could there be fear?

From delight arises grief; from delight arises fear.  
For one free from delight, there is no grief—how could there be fear?

From desire arises grief; from desire arises fear.  
For one free from desire, there is no grief—how could there be fear?

From craving arises grief; from craving arises fear.  
For one free from craving, there is no grief—how could there be fear?[2]

[2] **Cascading Analysis**: Five terms trace the root: *piya* (love), *pema* (fondness), *rati* (delight), *kāma* (desire), *taṇhā* (craving). Each verse identical in structure: *jāyatī soko, jāyatī bhayaṁ* (arises grief, arises fear). The rhetorical question *kuto bhayaṁ?* (how is there fear?) emphasizes liberation's freedom.

### Verses 217-220: True Love and Merit

**Verse 217**

One endowed with virtue and insight,  
Principled, knowing the truths,  
Doing one's own proper work—  
That one the people love.

**Verses 218-220**

One with desire for the undeclared,  
Mind suffused with awakening,  
Unattached to sense pleasures—  
Is called "one gone upstream."

When one long absent returns safely from afar,  
Relatives, friends, and companions rejoice.  
Just so, when one who has made merit  
Goes from this world to the next,  
Merit receives them like family  
Welcoming a loved one home.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Wholesome Love**: Not all love imprisons. *Sīladassanasampanna* (endowed with virtue and insight) generates proper admiration. Merit (*puñña*) accompanies us to the next life like family welcoming travelers home.

# Chapter 17: Kodhavagga (Anger)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Kodhavagga

The seventeenth chapter addresses *kodha* (anger)—its abandonment, its antidotes, and the famous teaching that no one in the world is entirely blameless or praiseworthy. The charioteer metaphor and the three gates (body, speech, mind) teaching are central.

---

### Verses 221-223: Abandoning Anger

**Verse 221**

Abandon anger, abandon conceit,  
Overcome every fetter.  
Without clinging to mind and body,  
Sufferings never befall the one without possessions.

**Verse 222**

Whoever holds back arisen anger  
Like controlling a swerving chariot—  
That one I call a charioteer.  
Others are merely rein-holders.

**Verse 223**

Through non-anger, overcome anger.  
Through goodness, overcome bad.  
Through giving, overcome stinginess.  
Through truth, overcome lying.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **The Charioteer Metaphor**: *Rathaṁ bhantaṁ va dhāraye* (like controlling a swerving chariot)—anger is like a runaway vehicle. Only one who controls it deserves the title *sārathi* (charioteer). The four antidotes (*akkodhena, sādhunā, dānena, saccena*) show conquering opposites with opposites.

---

### Verses 224-226: Truth, Gentleness, Liberation

**Verse 224**

Speak truth. Don't get angry.  
Give when asked, even a little.  
Through these three conditions,  
One can go to the presence of the gods.

**Verses 225-226**

Those sages without violence,  
Constantly restrained in body,  
Go to the deathless state—  
Having gone there, they grieve not.

For those always wakeful,  
Training day and night,  
Intent on Nibbāna—  
The pollutants are laid to rest.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **Three Practices, One Goal**: *Saccaṁ, na kujjheyya, dajjā* (truth, non-anger, giving). *Ahiṁsakā* (non-violent) sages reach *accutaṁ ṭhānaṁ* (the deathless state). *Sadā jāgaramānānaṁ* (always wakeful) leads to *āsavā atthaṁ gacchanti* (pollutants laid to rest).

---

### Verses 227-230: No One Escapes Blame

**Verses 227-228**

This is something ancient, Atula—not just today:  
They blame the silent one; they blame the talkative;  
They blame the moderate speaker.  
No one in the world goes unblamed.

There never was, nor will there be,  
Nor is there found at present,  
A person totally blameworthy  
Or one totally praiseworthy.

**Verses 229-230**

One whom the wise praise after daily examination—  
Faultless in conduct, sagacious, endowed with wisdom and virtue—  
Like a golden coin, who is worthy to blame that one?  
Even gods praise them; even Brahmā praises them.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **The Atula Teaching**: *Natthi loke anindito* (no one in the world is unblamed)—a famous teaching spoken to a lay disciple named Atula. Don't seek universal approval; it doesn't exist. But one like a *nekkhaṁ jambonadassa* (gold coin of finest quality) gains the praise that matters—from the wise and gods.

---

### Verses 231-234: Three Gates of Restraint

**Verses 231-233**

Guard against bodily anger; be restrained in body.  
Abandoning wrong bodily conduct, practice good bodily conduct.

Guard against verbal anger; be restrained in speech.  
Abandoning wrong verbal conduct, practice good verbal conduct.

Guard against mental anger; be restrained in mind.  
Abandoning wrong mental conduct, practice good mental conduct.

**Verse 234**

The wise are restrained in body,  
Then restrained in speech,  
Then restrained in mind—  
They are indeed fully restrained.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **The Three Doors**: *Kāya, vācā, mano* (body, speech, mind)—the three channels through which anger expresses. *Pakopaṁ rakkheyya* (guard against anger) in each. *Suparisaṁvutā* (fully restrained)—complete self-mastery.

**End of Kodhavagga (Chapter 17)**
# Chapter 18: Malavagga (Impurity / Stains)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Malavagga

The eighteenth chapter addresses *mala* (stains, impurities, rust). The central teaching: stains arise from within (like rust from iron) and consume what they arise from. Ignorance is the supreme stain. The silversmith metaphor shows gradual purification.

---

### Verses 235-239: Withered Leaf, Make Your Island

**Verses 235-238**

You are now like a withered leaf;  
Yama's messengers stand waiting.  
You stand at decay's door—  
With no provisions for the journey.

Make an island for yourself!  
Quickly strive, become wise.  
Removing the stain, blemishless,  
You will reach the divine, noble realm.

You are now advanced in age;  
You have come to Yama's presence.  
There is nowhere to dwell between—  
With no provisions for the journey.

Make an island for yourself!  
Quickly strive, become wise.  
Removing the stain, blemishless,  
You will not come to birth and old age again.

**Verse 239**

The sage gradually, little by little, moment by moment,  
Should remove the stain from himself—  
Like a silversmith removes impurity from silver.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **The Island and the Silversmith**: *Dīpam-attano* (island for oneself)—the self as refuge. *Yamapurisā* (Yama's messengers)—death's servants. The silversmith metaphor (*kammāro rajatasseva*) shows patient, gradual purification.

---

### Verses 240-243: Stains Consume Their Source

**Verses 240-243**

As rust arises from iron  
And eats away what it arose from,  
So one's own deeds lead the overindulgent  
To a bad destination.

Lack of repetition is the stain of mantras;  
Lack of maintenance is the stain of homes;  
Laziness is the stain of beauty;  
Heedlessness is the stain of one on guard.

Bad conduct is a stain for women;  
Stinginess is a giver's stain.  
Wicked deeds are stains  
In this world and the next.

Worse than those stains:  
Ignorance is the supreme stain.  
Abandoning that stain,  
Be stainless, O monastics![2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **Ignorance as Supreme Stain**: *Avijjā paramaṁ malaṁ* (ignorance is supreme stain). Various stains are listed, but ignorance underlies all. The rust metaphor: stains arise from within and destroy their source.

---

### Verses 244-248: Easy Life vs. Hard Life

**Verses 244-245**

Life is easy for the shameless,  
Bold as a crow, backbiting,  
Reckless, living with defilements.

Life is hard for one with shame,  
Constantly seeking purity,  
Sincere, not reckless, seeing the pure life.

**Verses 246-248**

Whoever kills, speaks falsely,  
Takes what is not given,  
Goes to another's spouse,  
Devotes himself to liquor—  
Digs up his own root in this world.

Know this, dear friend:  
Lack of restraint is a bad thing.  
Let not greed and corruption  
Oppress you with suffering long.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **The Five Precepts**: Verses 246-247 list violations of the five precepts: killing, lying, stealing, sexual misconduct, intoxication. *Mūlaṁ khaṇati attano* (digs up one's own root)—self-destruction.

---

### Verses 249-255: Passion, Hate, Delusion, Craving

**Verses 251-253**

No fire like passion;  
No seizing like hatred;  
No snare like delusion;  
No flood like craving.

Easy to see are others' faults;  
One's own is hard to see.  
One sifts others' faults like chaff  
But hides one's own like a crafty cheat.

Who constantly looks for others' faults,  
An abject complainer—  
For that one, pollutants increase;  
He is far from their destruction.

**Verses 254-255**

No footprint in the sky;  
No ascetic on the outside.  
Folk delight in impediments;  
The Tathāgatas are free of them.

No footprint in the sky;  
No ascetic on the outside.  
No conditions are eternal;  
No disturbance for the Buddhas.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **Four Dangers**: *Rāga* (passion) as fire, *dosa* (hatred) as seizure, *moha* (delusion) as snare, *taṇhā* (craving) as flood—classic formulation. Fault-finding increases pollutants. Final verses: liberation leaves no trace, like sky.

**End of Malavagga (Chapter 18)**
# Chapter 19: Dhammaṭṭhavagga (The Just / One Who Stands by Dhamma)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Dhammaṭṭhavagga

The nineteenth chapter addresses *dhammaṭṭha* (one who stands by Dhamma)—defining true wisdom, true eldership, true monasticism. The teaching repeatedly uses the pattern "not by X is one Y"—challenging external markers like speaking much, grey hair, or shaved head.

---

### Verses 256-259: Not by Speaking Much

**Verses 256-257**

One who hastily settles cases  
Is not one who stands by Dhamma.  
The wise one discriminates both:  
What is the case and what is not.

One who settles without haste,  
Justly, impartially—  
The sagacious one, protecting Dhamma,  
Is called one who stands by Dhamma.

**Verses 258-259**

One is not wise merely from speaking much;  
Being safe, hatred-free, fearless—  
That one is called a wise person.

One is not a Dhamma-bearer from speaking much,  
But one who, having heard even a little,  
Sees Dhamma for oneself—  
That is a Dhamma-bearer,  
Not heedless regarding Dhamma.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Experience Over Talk**: *Bahu bhāsati* (speaking much) doesn't make one wise or a Dhamma-bearer. *Dhammaṁ kāyena passati* (sees Dhamma in/with the body)—direct experience, not verbal knowledge.

---

### Verses 260-265: Not by External Marks

**Verses 260-261**

One is not an elder because the head has grey hair;  
Merely well-matured in age, one is "old in vain."  
In whom is truth, Dhamma, non-violence,  
Restraint and training—  
The wise one who threw out the stain  
Is truly called an elder.

**Verses 262-265**

Not by eloquence alone or beautiful complexion  
Is one honorable, if still jealous, selfish, deceitful.  
For one in whom this is cut off, destroyed at root—  
That sage who threw out hatred is called honorable.

Not by a shaven head is one an ascetic,  
If lacking vows, speaking lies, full of greed.  
One who pacifies wicked deeds, small and great—  
Through pacifying evil is called an ascetic.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **True Titles**: *Thera* (elder) is not about grey hair (*palitaṁ siro*) but about truth, non-violence, restraint. *Sādhurūpa* (honorable) requires cutting out jealousy, selfishness, deceit. *Samaṇa* (ascetic) means pacifying (*sameti*) evil, not external renunciation.

---

### Verses 266-272: True Monastics and Seers

**Verses 266-269**

One is not a monastic merely from eating almsfood  
Or undertaking false Dhamma.  
One who wards off both merit and demerit,  
Walking with discrimination—that one is a monastic.

Not through silence is a fool considered a seer.  
The wise one, like holding a balance,  
Takes up what is noble.  
The seer who rejects wicked deeds is a seer;  
Who understands both worlds is called a seer.

**Verses 270-272**

Not by hurting living beings is one noble;  
Not hurting any being, one is called noble.

Not merely through virtue, vows, learning,  
Concentration, or secluded dwelling—  
Do I attain renunciation's happiness.  
Let the monastic not be confident  
Until the pollutants are destroyed.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **No Complacency**: The chapter ends with warning: *vissāsa māpādi* (don't be confident) until *āsavakkhaya* (pollutants destroyed). External accomplishments don't guarantee liberation.

**End of Dhammaṭṭhavagga (Chapter 19)**
# Chapter 20: Maggavagga (The Path)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Maggavagga

The twentieth chapter presents *magga* (the path)—the Noble Eightfold Path. Contains the famous Three Marks teaching (anicca, dukkha, anattā) and urgent warnings against laziness and attachment.

---

### Verses 273-276: The Eightfold Path

**Verses 273-276**

The Eightfold is the best of paths;  
Four principles the best of truths;  
Passionlessness the best of states;  
The Visionary the best of beings.

This is THE path—there is no other—  
For insight and purity.  
Enter upon this path;  
This confounds Māra.

Having entered this path,  
You will make an end to suffering.  
The path was declared by me  
For removing the dart through knowledge.

Your duty is ardor—  
The Tathāgatas only point the way.  
Meditators who enter this path  
Are released from Māra's bonds.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **The Path Declared**: *Maggānaṭṭhaṅgiko seṭṭho* (Eightfold Path is best). *Eso va maggo natthañño* (this is THE path, no other). *Tumhehi kiccaṁ ātappaṁ* (your duty is ardor)—the Buddha points; you must walk.

---

### Verses 277-279: The Three Marks

**Verse 277**

All conditions are impermanent.  
When one sees this with wisdom,  
One grows tired of suffering—  
This is the path to purity.

**Verse 278**

All conditions are suffering.  
When one sees this with wisdom,  
One grows tired of suffering—  
This is the path to purity.

**Verse 279**

All dhammas are without self.  
When one sees this with wisdom,  
One grows tired of suffering—  
This is the path to purity.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **The Three Marks (Ti-lakkhaṇa)**: *Sabbe saṅkhārā aniccā* (all conditions impermanent); *sabbe saṅkhārā dukkhā* (all conditions suffering); *sabbe dhammā anattā* (all dhammas without self). Seeing any one of these deeply leads to *nibbidā* (disenchantment) and purity.

---

### Verses 280-285: Effort and Cutting Attachment

**Verses 280-282**

The lazy one—youthful, strong but indolent,  
Mind lacking right intention—  
Does not find wisdom's path.

Guarded in speech, well-restrained in mind,  
Not doing wrong with body—  
Purify these three paths of action;  
Undertake the path shown by seers.

From effort arises wisdom;  
Without effort, wisdom is destroyed.  
Understanding these two paths,  
Establish yourself so wisdom grows.

**Verses 283-285**

Cut down the forest, not just a tree—  
From the forest arises danger.  
Having cut forest and thicket,  
Be without forests, monastics.

As long as any atom of desire  
For women is not cut down,  
So long is the mind in bondage—  
Like a calf bound to mother's milk.

Cut off self-affection  
Like an autumn lotus plucked by hand.  
Develop the path to peace—  
Nibbāna taught by the Happy One.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **The Forest Metaphor**: *Vana* (forest) represents defilements. *Kumudaṁ sāradikaṁ va* (like autumn lotus)—cut self-affection cleanly. *Santimaggam-eva brūhaya* (develop the path to peace).

---

### Verses 286-289: Death Comes Like a Flood

**Verses 286-289**

"Here I'll stay for the rains;  
Here for winter and summer"—  
So thinks the fool,  
Not understanding the danger.

The person attached to children and cattle,  
Mind besotted—  
Is snatched by death  
Like a sleeping village by flood.

Children are not refuge;  
Nor father nor kin.  
For one overcome by the End-Maker,  
There is no refuge in relatives.

Understanding this truth,  
The wise one endowed with virtue  
Should quickly purify the path  
Leading to Nibbāna.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **No Refuge in Family**: *Na santi puttā tāṇāya* (children are not refuge)—at death, no relative can help. *Antakena* (the End-Maker)—death. *Khippam-eva visodhaye* (quickly purify)—urgency.

**End of Maggavagga (Chapter 20)**
# Chapter 21: Pakiṇṇakavagga (Miscellaneous)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Pakiṇṇakavagga

The twenty-first chapter of the Dhammapada gathers verses on diverse topics that resist easy categorization—hence "miscellaneous" (*pakiṇṇaka*). Yet a unifying thread runs through these teachings: the discernment required to distinguish true priorities from false ones. The chapter opens with strategic renunciation, moves through the dynamics of hatred and heedfulness, presents the famous "Six Recollections" (*cha anussati*) practiced by Gotama's disciples, and concludes with the solitary training that brings delight in forest retreat.

This chapter contains some of Buddhism's most counterintuitive verses—including the startling metaphor of "killing mother and father" (verses 294-295), which traditional commentary interprets as destroying craving and conceit, not actual patricide. Such shock-tactics demonstrate the Buddha's skillful use of language to break through conventional thinking.

---

### Verse 290: Strategic Renunciation

If by renouncing a small good one might see a greater good,
The wise one should renounce that small good,
Seeing the more extensive good.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Mattāsukha and Vipulasukha**: The verse contrasts *mattāsukha* (limited/small pleasure) with *vipulaṁ sukhaṁ* (extensive/great pleasure). This is not asceticism for its own sake but strategic discernment: sacrificing immediate gratification when a greater benefit beckons. The wise (*dhīra*) exercise *sampassaṁ* (clear seeing, discernment)—they perceive the long-term consequences of choices. Compare the economic concept of "opportunity cost": every choice forecloses alternatives. Buddhist wisdom weighs trade-offs across time and lives.

---

### Verse 291: The Trap of Hatred

One who desires happiness for oneself
By causing suffering for another,
Being thus associated with hatred,
Is not released from that hatred.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **Paradukkhūpadānena**: Literally "through laying down (causing) suffering for another." This verse exposes the self-defeating logic of pursuing happiness through others' pain. *Verasaṁsaggasaṁsaṭṭho* (entangled in association with hatred) describes how hostility breeds counter-hostility, creating an inescapable web. The one who harms others to advance themselves becomes *saṁsaṭṭha* (connected, entangled) with *vera* (hatred, enmity). Freedom (*parimuccati*) is impossible within such entanglement. This verse anticipates game theory insights: aggressive "win-lose" strategies often produce "lose-lose" cycles.

---

### Verses 292-293: The Heedless and the Mindful

**Verse 292**

That which should be done is cast aside,
What should not be done is done instead—
For the insolent and heedless,
Their pollutants increase.[3]

**Verse 293**

But for those who properly undertake
Mindfulness of the body constantly,
Who do not practice what should not be done,
Persisting in what should be done—
For those mindful, fully aware ones,
The pollutants come to rest.[4]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Kiccaṁ and Akiccaṁ**: *Kiccaṁ* (what should be done—duty, proper action) is *apaviddhaṁ* (rejected, cast aside), while *akiccaṁ* (what should not be done) is embraced. The *unnalā* (insolent, arrogant) and *pamatta* (heedless) thereby increase their *āsavā* (pollutants, fermentations)—the deep-seated defilements of sensuality, becoming, views, and ignorance that fuel rebirth.

[4] **Kāyagatā Sati**: Mindfulness of body (*kāyagatā sati*) is emphasized as the foundational practice. Those who are *sata* (mindful) and *sampajāna* (fully aware, comprehending clearly) reverse the pattern of verse 292. Their *āsavā* reach *attha* (cessation, completion)—the pollutants "go to rest." The contrast between these verses parallels the opening twin verses of Chapter 1: mental orientation determines karmic trajectory.

---

### Verses 294-295: The Paradoxical "Killings"

**Verse 294**

Having killed mother and father,
And two warrior kings,
Having killed a kingdom with its followers,
The brahmin proceeds untroubled.[5]

**Verse 295**

Having killed mother and father,
And two prosperous kings,
Having killed tiger as the fifth,
The brahmin proceeds untroubled.[6]

#### Footnotes

[5] **Metaphorical Parricide**: These shocking verses demand non-literal interpretation. The traditional commentary (*Aṭṭhakathā*) identifies: "mother" = craving (*taṇhā*, which gives birth to suffering); "father" = conceit (*māna*); "two warrior kings" = eternalism (*sassata-diṭṭhi*) and annihilationism (*uccheda-diṭṭhi*)—the two extreme views; "kingdom with followers" = the twelve sense bases (*āyatana*) with their attendant cravings. The *brāhmaṇa* (here meaning "one purified," the arahant) who destroys these proceeds *anīgha* (untroubled, without affliction). This use of paradox to shatter conventional thinking appears throughout Buddhist literature.

[6] **Veyyagghapañcama**: "Tiger as fifth" (*veyyagghapañcamaṁ*) is interpreted as the five hindrances (*nīvaraṇa*): sensual desire, ill-will, sloth-torpor, restlessness-worry, and doubt—with doubt being the "tiger" that devours clarity. Alternative readings take the "two kings" of this verse as different views: *sotthiye* (prosperous, safe) suggests attachment to comfortable beliefs. In either case, the verses demonstrate that liberation requires destroying not persons but mental defilements personified.

---

### Verses 296-301: The Six Recollections

These six verses share identical structure, each identifying how "Gotama's disciples always awake to a good awakening" (*suppabuddhaṁ pabujjhanti sadā Gotamasāvakā*) through constant practice of particular mindfulness. Together they constitute the *cha anussati*—six recollections central to Buddhist devotional and contemplative practice.

**Verse 296: Recollection of the Buddha**

Gotama's disciples always awake to a good awakening—
Those who day and night constantly have mindfulness of the Buddha.[7]

**Verse 297: Recollection of the Dhamma**

Gotama's disciples always awake to a good awakening—
Those who day and night constantly have mindfulness of the Dhamma.[8]

**Verse 298: Recollection of the Saṅgha**

Gotama's disciples always awake to a good awakening—
Those who day and night constantly have mindfulness of the Saṅgha.[9]

**Verse 299: Recollection of the Body**

Gotama's disciples always awake to a good awakening—
Those who day and night constantly have mindfulness of the body.[10]

**Verse 300: Recollection of Non-Violence**

Gotama's disciples always awake to a good awakening—
Those who day and night have a mind delighting in non-violence.[11]

**Verse 301: Recollection of Cultivation**

Gotama's disciples always awake to a good awakening—
Those who day and night have a mind delighting in cultivation.[12]

#### Footnotes

[7] **Buddhagatā Sati**: Mindfulness directed toward (*gatā*) the Buddha—recollecting the Awakened One's qualities: wisdom, compassion, teaching, liberation. This practice (*buddhānussati*) generates faith, inspiration, and protection of mind. *Suppabuddhaṁ pabujjhanti* plays on "Buddha" (awakened) and "pabujjhanti" (they awake)—a wordplay connecting the object of contemplation with its effect.

[8] **Dhammagatā Sati**: Recollection of the teaching (*dhammānussati*)—the truth, the path, the liberating doctrine. The Dhamma is praised as *svākkhāta* (well-proclaimed), *sandiṭṭhika* (visible here and now), *akālika* (immediate, timeless), *ehipassika* (inviting investigation), *opanayika* (leading onward), and *paccattaṁ veditabbo viññūhi* (to be known individually by the wise).

[9] **Saṅghagatā Sati**: Recollection of the community (*saṅghānussati*)—the noble disciples who have attained the fruits of the path. These three recollections (Buddha, Dhamma, Saṅgha) constitute the "Triple Gem" (*tiratana*) central to all Buddhist traditions.

[10] **Kāyagatā Sati**: This verse repeats the emphasis of verse 293. Mindfulness of body (*kāyānupassanā*) is the first of the four foundations of mindfulness (*satipaṭṭhāna*) and serves as the grounding practice for all contemplative development.

[11] **Ahiṁsāya Rato Mano**: A mind (*mano*) that *rato* (delights in, rejoices in) *ahiṁsā* (non-violence, non-harming). This is not merely abstaining from harm but actively cultivating delight in harmlessness—a positive orientation that protects against reactive hostility.

[12] **Bhāvanāya Rato Mano**: *Bhāvanā* encompasses all forms of mental cultivation—meditation, development of wholesome qualities, training of mind. A mind that delights in cultivation naturally inclines toward practice rather than distraction.

---

### Verse 302: The Difficulty of Both Paths

The going forth is hard, it is hard to find delight therein;
Hard too are households, suffering to dwell within.
Dwelling with those different is suffering;
Travelers in saṃsāra are beset by suffering.
Therefore, do not be a traveler;
Do not be one beset by suffering.[13]

#### Footnotes

[13] **Duppabbajjaṁ Durabhiramaṁ**: This lengthy verse acknowledges universal suffering: monastic life (*pabbajjā*, "going forth") is *duppa-* (hard, difficult), and finding delight (*abhirama*) therein is also hard. But household life (*ghara*, *āvāsa*) is equally suffering (*dukhā*). *Dusamānasaṁvāso* (dwelling with those of different mind/character) produces friction. The solution? Cease being an *addhagū* (traveler, wanderer) in *saṃsāra*—end the cycle entirely. This verse honestly acknowledges that no saṃsāric situation is satisfactory; the problem is conditioned existence itself, not merely the wrong circumstances.

---

### Verse 303: The Faithful One Honored

The faithful one endowed with virtue,
Possessed of wealth and fame—
Whatever district they resort to,
Right there they are worshipped.[14]

#### Footnotes

[14] **Saddho Sīlena Sampanno**: One possessing *saddhā* (faith, confidence) and *sīla* (virtue, moral conduct), along with *yasas* (fame, reputation) and *bhoga* (wealth, resources), receives *pūjā* (honor, worship) everywhere. This verse describes the wholesome integration of material and spiritual success—not renunciation but righteous prosperity. The truly virtuous person inspires respect universally; their qualities transcend local customs.

---

### Verse 304: The Visible and Invisible

The good are visible from afar,
Like a mountain covered in snow.
The wicked are not seen here,
Like arrows shot in the night.[15]

#### Footnotes

[15] **Himavanta Simile**: *Santo* (the good, the peaceful) *pakāsenti* (shine forth, are visible) *dūre* (from far away), compared to snow-capped *Himavanta* (the Himalayas). Such figures stand out in any landscape; their virtue is unmistakable. Conversely, *asanta* (the bad, unpeaceful) are *na dissanti* (not seen)—invisible like *sarā* (arrows) *khittā* (shot) *rattiṁ* (in the night). The wicked operate in darkness, their movements hidden. This verse invites reflection: which visibility characterizes me?

### Verse 305: Solitary Delight

Sitting alone, lying down alone,
Walking alone, diligent—
The solitary one who trains themselves
Will delight in the edge of the forest.[16]

#### Footnotes

[16] **Eko and Vananta**: *Ekāsana* (sitting alone), *ekaseyya* (lying alone), *eko caram* (walking alone), *atandito* (diligent, unwearied)—the description emphasizes complete physical and social solitude. *Eko damayam-attānaṁ* (the one alone training oneself) finds *ramito* (delight, pleasure) in *vananta* (the forest's edge, the wilderness). This is not alienation but the joy discovered when external distraction ceases and internal cultivation deepens. The "forest's edge" (*vananta*) suggests the transitional zone where society ends and nature begins—a liminal space conducive to transformation.

1. **Strategic Renunciation**: Sacrificing lesser goods for greater ones (verse 290)
2. **The Trap of Hatred**: Self-defeating pursuit of happiness through others' suffering (verse 291)
3. **Āsava Dynamics**: How pollutants increase (heedlessness) or decrease (mindfulness) (verses 292-293)

5. **Cha Anussati**: The six recollections as daily practice (verses 296-301)
6. **Vananta**: Forest-edge solitude as contemplative ideal (verse 305)

### Cross-References

- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 4**: Parable of the Burning House parallels the strategic renunciation logic of verse 290
- **Majjhima Nikāya 10**: Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta elaborates the body mindfulness of verses 293 and 299
- **Visuddhimagga VII**: Extensive treatment of the six recollections (verses 296-301)

### Historical Context

The *pakiṇṇaka* ("miscellaneous") classification likely reflects editorial decisions during the text's compilation rather than thematic disunity. These verses may have circulated independently before being gathered here. The shocking metaphors of verses 294-295 demonstrate how Buddhist teachers used provocative language to challenge conventional thinking—a technique that would later flourish in Chan/Zen literature.
# Chapter 22: Nirayavagga (The Underworld)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Nirayavagga

The twenty-second chapter confronts *niraya*—the "downward realm" or hell—with unflinching directness. In Buddhist cosmology, *niraya* represents not eternal damnation but temporary (though agonizingly prolonged) states resulting from unwholesome karma. This chapter catalogs the pathways to such suffering: false speech, hypocritical monasticism, sexual misconduct, wrong views, and moral confusion.

The chapter's pedagogical strategy is deterrence through vivid consequence. These verses functioned in Buddhist culture as moral reminders, often recited to reinforce ethical training. The teaching is not metaphysical speculation about the nature of hell realms but practical psychology: certain actions lead inexorably to certain sufferings.

Notably, several verses (316-318) employ a threefold parallel structure examining how wrong views (*micchā-diṭṭhi*) invert moral perception—making beings ashamed of the shameless, fearful of the harmless, and blind to genuine danger.

---

### Verse 306: False Speech and Denial

The one who speaks falsely goes to the underworld,
As does one who, having done, says "I did not do."
Both of these, when they have passed on, become just the same—
Humans who did base deeds in the hereafter.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Abhūtavādī**: One who speaks what is not (*abhūta*, "non-existent, false")—the liar. The verse pairs this with the more specific deception: *katvā 'na karomi' ti cāha* ("having done, says 'I do not do'")—denial of one's own actions. Both are *nihīnakamma* (of low/base deeds). The phrase *pecca samā bhavanti* ("having passed on, become the same") emphasizes karmic equality: elaborate deception and simple lying yield identical results. The Pali *upeti* (goes toward) suggests movement toward *niraya* as natural consequence, not divine punishment.

---

### Verse 307: The Unworthy Robe-Wearer

Many wearing the monastic robe around their necks
Are wicked and unrestrained—
The wicked, through their wicked deeds,
Re-arise in the underworld.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **Kāsāvakaṇṭhā**: Literally "ochre-robe-necked"—those who wear the monastic *kāsāva* (saffron/ochre robe). *Pāpadhammā* (wicked in nature) and *asaññatā* (unrestrained) describes the hypocrite: outer signs of renunciation, inner continuation of unwholesome states. *Upapajjare* (re-arise, are reborn) in *niraya* follows naturally from *pāpehi kammehi* (through wicked deeds). This verse recalls Chapter 1's teaching (verses 9-10) that the robe has meaning only when matched by inner transformation.

---

### Verse 308: The Iron Ball

It is better to have swallowed a glowing iron ball,
Like a flame of fire,
Than that a monk—unvirtuous and unrestrained—
Should enjoy the country's almsfood.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Ayoguḷo Bhutto**: The *ayoguḷa* (iron ball) *tatta* (heated, glowing) *aggisikhūpamo* (flame-like) represents extreme physical torment. Yet such suffering, the verse claims, is *seyya* (better) than the karmic consequence of a *dussīla* (unvirtuous) and *asaññata* (unrestrained) monastic consuming *raṭṭhapiṇḍa* (the country's almsfood—offerings from the faithful). The hyperbole is shocking: physical agony is preferable to the spiritual destruction of exploiting religious generosity. This verse influenced later Buddhist reform movements concerned with monastic discipline.

### Verses 309-310: Four Consequences of Adultery

**Verse 309**

There are four states the heedless man
Who consorts with another's wife undergoes:
Gaining demerit, an uncomfortable bed,
Blame as third, and the underworld as fourth.[4]

**Verse 310**

Gaining demerit and a bad destiny,
The small delight of a scared man with a scared woman,
And heavy punishment from kings—
Therefore one should not consort with another's wife.[5]

#### Footnotes

[4] **Cattāri Ṭhānāni**: Four *ṭhāna* (states, conditions) befall the *pamatta* (heedless) *paradārūpasevī* (one who approaches another's wife): (1) *apuññalābha* (gaining demerit—negative karma); (2) *nanikāmaseyya* (uncomfortable bed—disturbed sleep from guilt/fear); (3) *nindā* (blame, censure—social consequences); (4) *niraya* (the underworld—karmic destination). This progression moves from immediate psychological consequence through social penalty to ultimate cosmic result.

[5] **Bhītassa Bhītāya**: The phrase captures the anxiety pervading illicit relations—*bhīta* (frightened, scared) characterizes both parties. Their *ratī* (pleasure, delight) is *thokikā* (small, trifling). The *rāja* (king) applies *daṇḍa* (punishment) *garuka* (heavy, weighty). The verse concludes with practical advice: *tasmā* (therefore) *na seve* (one should not resort to). Buddhist ethics here aligns with social order—adultery harms self, partners, families, and society.

### Verse 311: The Jagged Grass

As jagged grass, wrongly grasped, cuts into the hand,
So does the monastic life, wrongly grasped,
Drag one down to the underworld.[6]

#### Footnotes

[6] **Kuso Yathā Duggahito**: *Kusa* grass has sharp edges that cut when grasped improperly. *Sāmañña* (the monastic life, asceticism) similarly *dupparāmaṭṭha* (wrongly handled, badly grasped) doesn't merely fail to help—it actively *upakaḍḍhati* (drags down) to *niraya*. The metaphor is precise: just as the same grass provides material for religious ceremonies when properly handled but injures when grasped carelessly, the monastic life can either liberate or condemn depending on how it's approached.

---

### Verses 312-313: Lax Practice

**Verse 312**

Whatever lax deed there is, and whatever vow is defiled,
A holy life that is doubtful—
This does not produce great fruit.[7]

**Verse 313**

If one would do what should be done,
One should be firm in that effort.
For the wanderer who is lax
Spreads much impurity.[8]

#### Footnotes

[7] **Sithilaṁ Kammaṁ**: *Sithila* means lax, loose, slack—opposite of disciplined. Combined with *saṅkiliṭṭha* (defiled) *vata* (vow, observance) and *saṅkassara* (doubtful, suspicious) *brahmacariya* (holy life), the result is *na mahapphala* (not of great fruit). Half-hearted practice yields meager results. The Buddhist path requires *viriya* (energy, effort)—mere going-through-the-motions accomplishes little.

[8] **Daḷham-enaṁ Parakkame**: *Daḷha* (firm, strong) effort is required. The *paribbāja* (wanderer, renunciant) who is *sathila* (lax, slack) *ākirate* (scatters, spreads) *raja* (dust, impurity)—polluting themselves and potentially others. The image suggests contamination: spiritual laxity doesn't remain contained but spreads pollution. This provides motivation for diligent practice.

---

### Verse 314: Better Undone Than Wrong-Done

Better undone is a wrong-doing,
For a wrong-doing one later regrets.
Better done is what is well-done,
Which, when done, one does not regret.[9]

#### Footnotes

[9] **Akataṁ Dukkataṁ Seyyo**: The verse establishes a hierarchy: *dukkataṁ* (wrong-doing, ill-done) is *seyya* (better) when *akataṁ* (undone)—one should abstain. *Pacchā tapati* ("later burns, regrets")—wrong action produces subsequent remorse. Conversely, *sukataṁ* (well-done) is better *kataṁ* (when done), since it produces *nānutappati* (no regret, no burning). The verse uses *tappati* (burns) to connect regret with the burning (*tapa*) torment of *niraya* itself—present psychological "burning" foreshadows potential cosmic burning.

---

### Verse 315: Guard Like a Border Town

As a border town is guarded within and without,
So should one guard oneself.
Let not the moment pass—
For when opportunity has passed, they grieve
Who are consigned to the underworld.[10]

#### Footnotes

[10] **Nagaraṁ Paccantaṁ**: A frontier city (*paccantaṁ nagaraṁ*) requires vigilance on all sides—*santarabāhiraṁ* (inside and outside). Similarly, one must *gopetha* (guard, watch over) *attānaṁ* (oneself). The urgency intensifies: *khaṇo vo mā upaccagā* ("let not the moment/opportunity pass you by"). *Khaṇātītā* (those whose moment has passed) *socanti* (grieve) when *samappitā* (consigned, established) in *niraya*. The verse emphasizes temporal urgency—opportunity for practice is fleeting; hell is for those who let it slip away.

---

### Verses 316-318: The Threefold Inversion of Wrong Views

These three verses share identical structure, each showing how *micchā-diṭṭhi* (wrong view) inverts proper perception.

**Verse 316: Shame Inverted**

They are ashamed of what is not shameful,
Not ashamed of what is shameful—
Undertaking wrong views,
Beings go to a bad destiny.[11]

**Verse 317: Fear Inverted**

Seeing fear in what is not fearful,
Not seeing fear in what is fearful—
Undertaking wrong views,
Beings go to a bad destiny.[12]

**Verse 318: Blame Inverted**

Finding fault in what is faultless,
Not seeing fault in what is faulty—
Undertaking wrong views,
Beings go to a bad destiny.[13]

#### Footnotes

[11] **Alajjitāye Lajjanti**: *Lajjā* (shame, moral conscience) properly applied is a protective factor. But those with inverted views feel shame (*lajjanti*) regarding what requires none (*alajjitāya*) while feeling none (*na lajjare*) where shame is appropriate (*lajjitāya*). Such beings *samādāna* (undertake, take up) *micchā-diṭṭhi* (wrong view)—their fundamental orientation is distorted. They go to *duggati* (bad destination, unfortunate rebirth).

[12] **Abhaye Bhayadassino**: Fear (*bhaya*) likewise becomes inverted. Those with wrong views see fear (*bhayadassino*) in harmless things (*abhaye*) while seeing no fear (*ābhayadassino*) in genuinely dangerous things (*bhaye*). This describes both specific cases (fearing the harmless, ignoring real threats) and the fundamental spiritual error of fearing liberation while embracing suffering.

[13] **Avajje Vajjamatino**: *Vajja* (fault, blame) requires correct perception. Finding fault (*vajjamatino*) in the faultless (*avajje*) and seeing none (*avajjadassino*) in the genuinely faulty (*vajje*) represents moral blindness. The three verses (316-318) together show how wrong view corrupts the three protective mental factors: shame (*hiri*), fear of wrongdoing (*ottappa*), and discernment of blame.

---

### Verse 319: Right Views and Good Destiny

Knowing blame in what is blameworthy,
And no blame in what is blameless,
Undertaking right views,
Beings go to a good destiny.[14]

#### Footnotes

[14] **Sammādiṭṭhisamādānā**: This verse reverses the pattern—*sammā-diṭṭhi* (right view) enables *ñatvā* (knowing, recognizing) *vajja* (blame) in what is blameworthy (*vajjato*) and its absence (*avajja*) in what is blameless (*avajjato*). Such beings go to *suggati* (good destination, fortunate rebirth). The chapter thus closes not with damnation but with the alternative: right view leads to good outcomes. The pathway to *niraya* can be avoided through correct understanding.

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Key Concepts

1. **Niraya**: The "downward realm," hell—not eternal but temporary karmic consequence
2. **Micchā-diṭṭhi**: Wrong view—the root distortion that inverts moral perception
3. **Khaṇa**: The opportune moment—urgency of practice before opportunity passes
4. **Moral Inversion**: Shame, fear, and blame-perception corrupted by wrong views
5. **Hypocrisy's Cost**: The special danger of external religion without internal transformation

### Cross-References

- **Majjhima Nikāya 41**: Sāleyyaka Sutta details actions leading to *niraya*
- **Anguttara Nikāya 3.36**: Three causes of downfall parallel this chapter's concerns
- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 3**: Burning House parable similarly uses vivid imagery to motivate liberation
- **Tibetan Wheel of Life**: Visual depictions of hell realms elaborate themes here

### Historical Context

Buddhist cosmology developed elaborate descriptions of hell realms (*niraya*), including hot and cold hells with specific torments. This chapter predates such elaboration, presenting *niraya* more as inevitable consequence than detailed geography. The emphasis on hypocrisy (verses 307-308) reflects concerns about monastic authenticity that recur throughout Buddhist history.
# Chapter 23: Nāgavagga (The Elephant)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Nāgavagga

The twenty-third chapter employs the elephant (*nāga*) as its central metaphor—an animal that held special significance in Indian culture as symbol of strength, nobility, patience, and trainability. The Buddha himself was compared to an elephant, and his great going-forth was said to occur on the full moon of the elephant month.

This chapter develops the metaphor in multiple directions: the trained elephant as model of self-discipline, the elephant in battle as exemplar of patience under abuse, the solitary forest elephant as ideal of spiritual independence, and the elephant in musth as image of the untamed mind requiring control. The teaching moves from endurance through self-training to the possibility of noble solitude—and concludes with an enumeration of genuine goods (*sukha*).

---

### Verse 320: Endurance Like a Battle Elephant

Like an elephant in battle
Endures an arrow shot from bow,
So shall I endure abuse—
For many people are unvirtuous.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Nāgo va Saṅgāme**: The *nāga* (elephant) in *saṅgāma* (battle, combat) endures *sara* (arrows) *patitaṁ* (fallen, shot) *cāpāto* (from the bow). This becomes the model for *titikkhissaṁ* (I will endure, I will be patient with) *ativākyaṁ* (abuse, harsh words, verbal attack). The reason for such endurance is pragmatic: *dussīlo hi bahujjano* ("for many people are unvirtuous"). Expecting others to be virtuous leads to constant disappointment and reactive anger. The wise accept that many will speak harshly—and prepare to endure like the battle elephant, massive and unmoved.

---

### Verses 321-323: The Value of Self-Training

**Verse 321**

They lead one trained into a crowd;
A king mounts one who has been trained.
Amongst humans, the trained one is best—
The one who can endure abuse.[2]

**Verse 322**

Noble are the well-trained horses,
The well-bred horses from Sindh,
And the great tusker elephants—
But more noble still is one who has trained themselves.[3]

**Verse 323**

Not by these vehicles can one go
To the destination beyond destinations—
As one, through training oneself well,
Being trained, goes by that training.[4]

#### Footnotes

[2] **Dantaṁ Nayanti Samitiṁ**: The *danta* (trained, tamed) elephant is *nayanti* (led) into *samiti* (assembly, crowd)—it can be trusted in public. The *rāja* (king) *abhirūhati* (mounts) only a trained elephant. By extension, the person who is *danta* (trained in self-restraint) and can *titikkhati* (endure) *ativākyaṁ* (abuse) is *seṭṭha* (best, chief) among *manussesu* (humans). Character proven under stress commands respect.

[3] **Attadanto Tato Varaṁ**: Even noble beasts—*assatarā* (mules/horses), *ājānīyā Sindhavā* (thoroughbred Sindhi horses renowned for quality), *kuñjarā mahānāgā* (great tusker elephants)—are surpassed (*tato varaṁ*, "more noble than that") by the *attadanta* (self-trained). External creatures, however magnificent, cannot equal the human being who has achieved self-mastery.

[4] **Agataṁ Disaṁ**: The *agatā disā* (the "un-gone region," the place not yet reached—i.e., *nibbāna*) cannot be reached by physical *yāna* (vehicles, conveyances). Only *sudantena attanā* (by the well-trained self), *danto dantena* ("trained by the training"), does one *gacchati* (go). The verse emphasizes that liberation is achieved through internal transformation, not external transport.

---

### Verse 324: The Elephant Remembers the Forest

The tusker named Dhanapālaka,
Musty in rut and difficult to restrain,
Though bound, does not eat even a morsel—
The tusker remembers the elephant forest.[5]

#### Footnotes

[5] **Dhanapālaka and Nāgavana**: This verse draws on a specific elephant story known in Buddhist tradition. *Dhanapālaka* ("guardian of wealth") was a famous elephant captured from the wild. Despite being *kaṭukappabhedana* (in fierce musth—the aggressive state of male elephants in rut) and *dunnivāraya* (hard to restrain), when *baddha* (bound, captured) he refuses food (*kabalaṁ na bhuñjati*, "doesn't eat a morsel"). Why? He *sumarati* (remembers well) the *nāgavana* (elephant forest)—his wild home. The verse serves as analogy: the practitioner, caught in saṃsāra, should remember their true home (liberation) with such intensity that worldly pleasures lose their appeal.

---

### Verse 325: The Torpid Fool

When one is torpid and overeats,
Sleepy, rolling on the bed,
Like a great pig fed on fodder—
That fool comes to the womb again.[6]

#### Footnotes

[6] **Mahāvarāho va Nivāpapuṭṭho**: The contrast with the elephant is sharp. One who is *middhī* (torpid, sluggish), *mahagghasa* (eating much, gluttonous), *niddāyitā* (sleepy), *samparivattasāyī* (rolling on the bed) resembles not the noble elephant but the *mahāvarāha* (great pig) *nivāpapuṭṭha* (fed on fodder). Such a *manda* (fool) *punappunaṁ* (again and again) *upeti gabbhaṁ* (enters the womb)—is endlessly reborn. The image is deliberately unflattering: while the elephant embodies nobility and self-restraint, the pig represents wallowing indulgence.

---

### Verse 326: Controlling the Mind

Formerly this wandering mind wandered
Through desire, pleasure, and delight,
But today I shall control it wisely—
Like the man with goad controls an elephant in musth.[7]

#### Footnotes

[7] **Hatthim-pabhinnaṁ**: The *citta* (mind) is compared to *hatthī pabhinna* (an elephant in musth—the state of aggressive, dangerous unpredictability caused by hormonal surge). It *acāri cārikaṁ* (wandered in wandering)—unconstrained, running wherever *icchaka* (desire), *kāma* (pleasure), and *sukha* (happiness) directed. But *ajja* (today) the practitioner resolves to *niggahessāmi yoniso* (control it wisely, restrain it skillfully), like an *aṅkusaggaha* (goad-holder, elephant trainer) manages a dangerous beast. The verse marks a decisive turn from indulgence to discipline.

---

### Verse 327: Rising from the Pit

You should delight in heedfulness;
You should always protect your mind.
Raise yourself from this difficult ground—
Like a tusker sunk in mud.[8]

#### Footnotes

[8] **Paṅke Sanno va Kuñjaro**: Be *appamādaratā* (delighting in heedfulness); *anurakkhatha* (protect) *sacittaṁ* (your own mind). Then *uddharatha attānaṁ* (raise yourself) from the *dugga* (difficult ground, pit, mire). The simile: *kuñjaro* (tusker) *sanno* (sunk) *paṅke* (in mud). Elephants occasionally become trapped in mud, requiring tremendous effort to extract themselves. The spiritual lesson: saṃsāric mire traps us, but with energetic effort we can lift ourselves out.

---

### Verses 328-330: The Question of Companions

**Verse 328**

If you should find a prudent friend,
A companion who lives well and wisely,
Overcoming all your troubles,
You should live with that one—glad and mindful.[9]

**Verse 329**

But if you do not find a prudent friend,
A companion who lives well and wisely,
Like a king who abandons his conquered kingdom—
One should live alone, like a solitary elephant in the forest.[10]

**Verse 330**

Better to live alone—
There can be no friendship with a fool.
Living alone, one should do no wrong,
Unconcerned, like a solitary elephant in the forest.[11]

#### Footnotes

[9] **Nipakaṁ Sahāyaṁ**: If one *labhetha* (obtains, finds) a *nipaka* (prudent, wise) *sahāya* (friend, companion) who is *sādhuvihārin* (lives well) and *dhīra* (wise), then *abhibhuyya* (overcoming) *sabbāni parissayāni* (all troubles, dangers), one should *careyya* (live) *attamano* (glad, pleased) and *satīmā* (mindful). Good companionship supports practice.

[10] **Mātaṅgaraññe va Nāgo**: If no such companion is found, the alternative is dramatic: like a *rāja* (king) who *pahāya* (abandons) his *vijitaṁ raṭṭhaṁ* (conquered kingdom), one should *eko care* (dwell alone) like a *nāga* (elephant) in the *mātaṅgarañña* (elephant-forest, wilderness). The image suggests that solitude, when necessary, is preferable to compromised association.

[11] **Natthi Bāle Sahāyatā**: *Sahāyatā* (companionship, friendship) with a *bāla* (fool) is *natthi* (non-existent, impossible)—fools cannot be true friends because friendship requires wisdom. Better to *eko care* (live alone), *na pāpāni kayirā* (not do evil), *appossukko* (unconcerned, without anxiety), like the solitary forest elephant. These three verses together present a graduated teaching: seek wise companions if available; if not, honorable solitude surpasses foolish company.

---

### Verses 331-333: The Enumeration of Goods

**Verse 331**

Friends are good when need arises;
Contentment with whatever one has is good;
Merit at life's end is good;
The abandoning of all suffering is good.[12]

**Verse 332**

Respecting mother is good in the world;
Also respecting father is good;
Respecting ascetics is good in the world;
Also respecting true brahmins is good.[13]

**Verse 333**

Moral conduct until old age is good;
The establishment of faith is good;
The acquisition of wisdom is good;
Refraining from evil is good.[14]

#### Footnotes

[12] **Atthamhi Jātamhi Sukhā Sahāyā**: When *attha* (need, necessity) *jātamhi* (has arisen), *sahāyā* (friends) are *sukhā* (good, pleasant, beneficial). *Tuṭṭhī* (contentment) *itarītarena* (with whatever) is good. *Puññaṁ* (merit) *jīvitasaṅkhayamhi* (at life's dissolution) is good—accumulated goodness helps at death. Finally, *sabbassa dukkhassa pahāṇaṁ* (the abandoning of all suffering)—ultimate liberation—is *sukhaṁ* (good). The verse moves from conventional goods (friendship, contentment) to ultimate good (liberation).

[13] **Matteyyatā and Petteyyatā**: *Matteyyatā* (respecting mother) and *petteyyatā* (respecting father) are *sukhā* (good) in the *loka* (world). Similarly, respecting *samaṇa* (ascetics, renunciants) and *brāhmaṇa* (brahmins—here meaning genuine spiritual practitioners, not merely caste identity) is good. These represent the vertical dimension of ethics: honoring those above us in age, sacrifice, and spiritual attainment.

[14] **Sīlaṁ Yāva Jarā Sukhaṁ**: *Sīla* (moral conduct, virtue) *yāva jarā* (until old age) is *sukhaṁ* (good)—lifelong ethics, not temporary restraint. *Saddhā patiṭṭhitā* (established faith) is good. *Paññāya paṭilābho* (acquisition of wisdom) is good. *Pāpānaṁ akaraṇaṁ* (non-doing of evil) is *sukhaṁ*. The chapter concludes with these affirmations of fundamental Buddhist values.

### Historical Context

Elephants were central to Indian life—in war, ceremony, labor, and imagination. The Buddha's contemporaries would have known elephant behavior intimately. The *musth* elephant (*pabhinna*) was genuinely dangerous, making the metaphor of mind-as-wild-elephant viscerally compelling. The *Dhanapālaka* story (verse 324) appears in the commentarial tradition as example of longing for one's true home—a theme that would later flourish in Pure Land Buddhism's imagery of exile and return.
# Chapter 24: Taṇhāvagga (Craving)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Taṇhāvagga

The twenty-fourth chapter addresses *taṇhā*—craving, thirst, desire—identified in the Second Noble Truth as the origin of suffering (*dukkha-samudaya*). This is among the Dhammapada's most doctrinally significant chapters, treating Buddhism's core diagnostic insight: that suffering arises from craving and ceases with craving's destruction.

The chapter employs rich organic imagery: craving is a vine (*māluvā*), a creeper (*latā*), grass growing after rain (*bīraṇa*), streams flowing everywhere (*sotā*). These metaphors emphasize craving's tenacity, its tendency to spread, and its deep roots. Against this, the Buddha prescribes radical uprooting (*mūlaṁ khaṇatha*, "dig up the root")—superficial pruning allows regrowth.

The chapter climaxes with the Buddha's own declaration of liberation (verse 353) and the famous verse identifying the Dhamma as supreme gift, taste, and delight (verse 354). The concluding verses (356-359) systematically identify the "weeds" that ruin beings: passion, hatred, delusion, and desire.

---

### Verses 334-335: Craving's Growth

**Verse 334**

For a human who lives heedlessly,
Craving increases like a clinging creeper.
They rush from one existence to another
Like a monkey seeking fruit in the forest.[1]

**Verse 335**

One overcome by this wretched craving,
This attachment to the world—
For them griefs increase
Like grass after heavy rain.[2]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Māluvā viya**: The *māluvā* (a parasitic vine that strangles trees) perfectly illustrates *taṇhā*: it clings, spreads, and eventually destroys its host. The *pamattacārin* (one living heedlessly) experiences craving's expansion. *Palavati hurāhuraṁ* ("rushes from here to there") describes existential restlessness—like a *vānara* (monkey) *phalām-icchaṁ* (desiring fruit) *vanasmi* (in the forest). The image captures saṃsāric wandering: driven by desire, we leap from existence to existence, never satisfied.

[2] **Bīraṇaṁ Abhivaṭṭhaṁ**: *Bīraṇa* grass springs up abundantly after rain (*abhivaṭṭha*, "rained upon"). For one *sahatī* (overcome) by *jammī taṇhā* (wretched craving) and *visattikā* (attachment, clinging), *sokā* (griefs) similarly *pavaḍḍhanti* (increase, grow). The agricultural metaphor is apt: just as monsoon rains produce rapid grass growth, craving-conditions produce rapid grief-proliferation.

### Verses 336-337: Overcoming Craving

**Verse 336**

Whoever overcomes this wretched craving in the world,
Which is difficult to transcend—
Griefs fall from them
Like a water drop from a lotus.[3]

**Verse 337**

This I say to you: "Good fortune to all gathered here!"
Dig up the root of craving,
Like one seeking the fragrant root digs up grass.
Do not let Māra break you again and again,
Like a stream breaks the reed.[4]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Udabindu va Pokkharā**: For one who *sahatī* (overcomes) *duraccayaṁ* (hard-to-transcend) craving, *sokā* (griefs) *papatanti* (fall away) like *udabindu* (water drop) from *pokkhara* (lotus leaf). The lotus's waxy surface repels water—drops bead and roll off. Similarly, the mind freed from craving doesn't retain grief; suffering slides away without purchase.

[4] **Taṇhāya Mūlaṁ Khaṇatha**: The Buddha directly addresses the assembly: *khaṇatha* (dig up, excavate) the *mūla* (root) of *taṇhā*. The simile is *usīrattha* (one seeking fragrant *usīra* root) digging up the whole grass plant. Merely cutting craving's surface manifestations allows regrowth; the root must be extracted. The counter-warning: don't let *Māra* *bhañji* (break, crush) you *punappunaṁ* (again and again), like a *sota* (stream, current) *bhañji* (breaks) *naḷaṁ* (reeds).

### Verses 338-340: Root and Stream

**Verse 338**

Just as a tree cut down grows again
When its root remains firm and untroubled,
So when the tendency to craving is not rooted out,
This suffering arises again and again.[5]

**Verse 339**

One in whom the thirty-six streams flow strong,
Streams flowing toward the pleasant—
Such a one of wrong view is carried away
By passionate intentions.[6]

**Verse 340**

Streams flow everywhere;
The creeper springs up and stands.
Seeing that creeper arisen,
Cut its root with wisdom.[7]

#### Footnotes

[5] **Taṇhānusaye Anūhate**: *Anusaya* (latent tendency, underlying tendency) represents craving's deepest form—not active desire but the predisposition to desire. When this is *anūhata* (not uprooted, not dug out), *dukkha* *nibbattatī* (arises, appears) *punappunaṁ* (again and again). The tree metaphor is precise: surface cutting produces regrowth; only root-destruction ends the cycle.

[6] **Chattiṁsatī Sotā**: The "thirty-six streams" traditionally represent craving operating through six sense bases (eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind) multiplied by six objects, or alternatively, craving in three modes (for sensuality, existence, non-existence) across twelve sense-object combinations. *Manāpassavanā* (flowing toward the pleasant) describes hedonic orientation. Such a person is *vahanti* (carried away) by *saṅkappā* (intentions, thoughts) *rāganissitā* (dependent on passion).

[7] **Mūlaṁ Paññāya Chindatha**: The instruction is direct: *disvā* (seeing) the *latā jātā* (creeper arisen), *chindatha* (cut) its *mūla* (root) *paññāya* (with wisdom). Insight (*paññā*) is the instrument of liberation—not force or suppression but clear seeing of craving's nature and origin.

### Verses 341-343: The Crawling Hare

**Verse 341**

There are flowing streams of affection
And mental pleasures for a person.
Dependent on pleasures, seeking happiness,
Those people undergo birth and aging.[8]

**Verse 342**

People surrounded by craving
Crawl around like a hare caught in a trap.
Attached and clinging to fetters,
They return to suffering again and again, for long.[9]

**Verse 343**

People surrounded by craving
Crawl around like a hare caught in a trap.
Therefore, the monk longing for dispassion
Should remove craving.[10]

#### Footnotes

[8] **Saritāni Sinehitāni**: *Sneha* (affection, attachment, viscosity—like oil clinging) produces *somanassa* (mental happiness, pleasure). Those *sātasitā* (attached to pleasure) and *sukhesino* (seeking happiness) become *jātijarūpagā* (undergoers of birth and old age). The verse describes ordinary life: pleasant feelings create attachment; attachment creates rebirth; rebirth guarantees old age and death.

[9] **Saso va Bādhito**: *Pajā* (people, beings) *purakkhatā* (surrounded, preceded) by *tasiṇā* (thirst, intense craving) *parisappanti* (crawl around, creep about) like *saso* (hare) *bādhito* (caught, trapped). The image is vivid: a snared hare struggles desperately but only tightens the trap. *Saṁyojanasaṅgasattakā* (attached and clinging to fetters)—bound by the ten fetters that chain beings to saṃsāra.

[10] **Bhikkhu Ākaṅkha Virāgam-attano**: The solution for the *bhikkhu* (monk, mendicant) who *ākaṅkhati* (longs for, desires) *virāga* (dispassion, fading away of lust) *attano* (for oneself) is to *vinodaye* (remove, dispel) *tasiṇaṁ* (craving). The very desire for liberation (*virāga*) must be employed to destroy desire.

### Verses 344-347: True and False Bondage

**Verse 344**

One freed from the woods, intent on the forest—
Though freed from the forest, runs back to the forest.
Come, look at this person:
Though freed, running back to bondage.[11]

**Verse 345-346**

That bondage is not strong, say the wise,
Which is made of iron, wood, or reeds.
But impassioned attraction to jewels and earrings,
Longing for children and wives—
This bondage is strong, say the wise,
Dragging down, yielding, hard to escape.
Having cut even this, they wander forth,
Seeking nothing, abandoning sensual happiness.[12]

**Verse 347**

Those impassioned by passion follow the stream
Like a spider its self-made web.
Having cut even this, the wise proceed,
Seeking nothing, abandoning all suffering.[13]

#### Footnotes

[11] **Nibbanatho Vanādhimutto**: This verse contains famous wordplay on *vana* (forest) and *vana* (desire/craving—a different word but homophonous in some contexts). One *nibbanatha* (freed from desires) yet *vanādhimutta* (intent on the forest/craving), though *vanamutto* (freed from forest/craving), *vanam-eva dhāvati* (runs right back to forest/craving). The teaching: liberation from one form of attachment often leads to attachment in another form. Even spiritual attainment can become a new object of craving.

[12] **Āyasaṁ Dārujaṁ Pabbajañ-ca**: Physical bonds—*āyasa* (iron), *dāruja* (wooden), *pabbaja* (made of reeds/grass)—are *na daḷha* (not strong) compared to psychological attachment. *Sārattarattā* (thoroughly impassioned) seeking *maṇikuṇḍalesu* (jewels and earrings) and *apekhā* (longing) for *puttesu dāresu* (children and wives)—these are *daḷha* (firm, strong) bonds. They are *ohārina* (dragging down), *sithila* (yielding, soft), yet *duppamuñca* (hard to escape). The truly liberated *chetvā* (having cut) this *paribbajanti* (wander forth) *anapekkhino* (seeking nothing).

[13] **Makkaṭako va Jālaṁ**: Those *rāgarattā* (impassioned by passion) *anupatanti sotaṁ* (follow the stream, fall into the current) *sayaṁkataṁ* (self-made) like a *makkaṭaka* (spider) and its *jāla* (web). We create our own entrapment; our attachments are self-spun. The *dhīrā* (wise) *chetvā* (having cut) this web *vajanti* (proceed) *anapekkhino* (seeking nothing), *sabbadukkhaṁ pahāya* (having abandoned all suffering).

---

### Verse 348: Liberation from Time

Be free of the past, be free of the future,
Be free of the present.
Having crossed over existence,
With mind liberated in every way,
You will not return to birth and aging.[14]

#### Footnotes

[14] **Muñca Pure Pacchato Majjhe**: *Muñca* (release, let go) is applied to all three times: *pure* (before, the past), *pacchato* (after, the future), *majjhe* (middle, the present). This teaching transcends ordinary time-bound practice. By releasing attachment to past, future, and present, one becomes *pāragū bhavassa* (one gone beyond existence). *Sabbattha vimuttamānaso* (with mind liberated everywhere)—complete liberation in all modes. Result: *na punaṁ jātijaraṁ upehisi* (you will not again approach birth and aging).

---

### Verses 349-350: Thought and Counter-Practice

**Verse 349**

For a person crushed by thoughts,
Of intense passion, contemplating the attractive—
Craving increases more and more.
This surely makes the bond firm.[15]

**Verse 350**

Whoever delights in thought-calmment,
Always mindfully cultivating the unattractive—
Will surely abolish this craving;
They will cut Māra's bond.[16]

#### Footnotes

[15] **Vitakkapamathitassa**: One *pamathita* (crushed, agitated, tormented) by *vitakka* (thoughts, mental applications), possessing *tibbarāga* (intense passion) and *subhānupassin* (contemplating the pleasant/attractive), experiences *taṇhā* (craving) *bhiyyo pavaḍḍhati* (increasing more). This *daḷhaṁ karoti bandhanaṁ* (makes the bond firm)—a vicious cycle of thought, passion, and craving reinforcing each other.

[16] **Vitakkupasame Rato**: The antidote: *rata* (delight) in *vitakkupasama* (calming of thoughts)—meditation that stills discursive thinking. *Bhāvayati* (cultivates) *asubhaṁ* (the unattractive, contemplation of decomposition) *sadā sato* (always mindful). This *vyantikāhiti* (abolishes, makes an end of) craving and *checchati Mārabandhanaṁ* (cuts Māra's bond). Contemplating the unattractive counteracts the "attractive-contemplation" of verse 349.

---

### Verses 351-352: The Accomplished One

**Verse 351**

Having gone to the end, without trembling,
Without craving, without defilement,
Having cut the thorns of existence—
This is their final body.[17]

**Verse 352**

Without craving, without grasping,
Skilled in expressions and their order,
Knowing how syllables are arranged,
Which come before and which after—
This one in their final body
Is called "one of great wisdom."[18]

#### Footnotes

[17] **Niṭṭhaṁ Gato Asantāsī**: *Niṭṭhaṁ gata* (gone to completion, reached the goal), *asantāsī* (without trembling, fearless), *vītataṇha* (without craving), *anaṅgaṇa* (spotless, without defilement)—this person has *acchindi* (cut off) *bhavasallāni* (the thorns/arrows of existence). *Antimoyaṁ samussayo* (this is the final combination/body)—no more rebirth follows.

[18] **Niruttipadakovido**: The arahant is also *kovida* (skilled, expert) in *nirutti* (language, etymology) and *pada* (expressions, words). They understand *akkharānaṁ sannipātaṁ* (how syllables combine) and *pubbaparāni* (what comes before and after—sequence, grammar). This describes mastery of teaching ability alongside liberation. Such a one is *antimasārīra* (in their final body) and *mahāpañña* (of great wisdom).

### Verse 353: The Buddha's Declaration

"All-Conquering, All-Wise am I,
Undefiled regarding all things,
Having given up everything,
Liberated through craving's destruction.
Having known directly myself—
Whom should I point to as Teacher?"[19]

#### Footnotes

[19] **Sabbābhibhū Sabbavidū**: This verse is attributed to the Buddha himself at the moment of enlightenment. *Sabbābhibhū* (all-conquering, having overcome all), *sabbavidu* (all-knowing), *anūpalitto* (undefiled, unstained) regarding *sabbesu dhammesu* (all phenomena). *Sabbañjaha* (having abandoned all), *vimutta* (liberated) *taṇhakkhaye* (through craving's destruction). The rhetorical question *kam-uddiseyyaṁ* (whom should I point to) indicates self-enlightenment without teacher—the unprecedented achievement of Buddhahood.

---

### Verse 354: The Supreme Gift

The gift of Dhamma surpasses all gifts;
The taste of Dhamma surpasses all tastes;
The love of Dhamma surpasses all loves;
The destruction of craving overcomes all suffering.[20]

#### Footnotes

[20] **Sabbadānaṁ Dhammadānaṁ Jināti**: This frequently-quoted verse establishes hierarchies: *dhammadāna* (gift of teaching) *jināti* (conquers, surpasses) *sabbadānaṁ* (all gifts). *Dhammarasa* (taste of truth) *jināti sabbaṁ rasaṁ* (conquers all tastes). *Dhammarati* (love/delight in teaching) *jināti sabbaṁ ratiṁ* (conquers all delights). Finally, *taṇhakkhaya* (craving's destruction) *jināti sabbadukkhaṁ* (conquers all suffering)—connecting the chapter's theme with ultimate victory.

### Verse 355: Wealth's Danger

Riches destroy the foolish one
Who does not seek the way beyond.
Through craving for riches,
The fool destroys others and themselves.[21]

#### Footnotes

[21] **Hananti Bhogā Dummedhaṁ**: *Bhoga* (riches, possessions) *hananti* (destroy, kill) the *dummedha* (foolish, stupid). One who does not *pāragavesino* (seek the beyond, search for the further shore) is vulnerable to wealth's corruption. Through *bhogataṇhā* (craving for possessions), the fool *hanti* (destroys) *aññe* (others) and *attanaṁ* (themselves). Wealth itself is neutral; craving for wealth devastates.

### Verses 356-359: The Four Weeds

**Verse 356: Passion**

Fields are ruined by weeds;
These people are ruined by passion.
Therefore, great is the fruit
Of giving to those free from passion.[22]

**Verse 357: Hatred**

Fields are ruined by weeds;
These people are ruined by hatred.
Therefore, great is the fruit
Of giving to those free from hatred.[23]

**Verse 358: Delusion**

Fields are ruined by weeds;
These people are ruined by delusion.
Therefore, great is the fruit
Of giving to those free from delusion.[24]

**Verse 359: Desire**

Fields are ruined by weeds;
These people are ruined by desire.
Therefore, great is the fruit
Of giving to those free from desire.[25]

#### Footnotes

[22] **Rāgadosā**: *Tiṇa* (grass, weeds) ruins (*dosa*, here meaning "fault" or "ruin") *khettāni* (fields). Similarly, *rāga* (passion, lust) is the *dosa* (ruin, fault) of people. Therefore, *dinnaṁ* (what is given) to *vītarāga* (those free from passion) is *mahapphala* (of great fruit). The final four verses systematically identify what ruins beings and recommends giving to those who have overcome these faults.

[23] **Dosadosā**: *Dosa* (hatred, aversion) ruins beings as weeds ruin fields. Give to *vītadosa* (those free from hatred) for great fruit.

[24] **Mohadosā**: *Moha* (delusion, ignorance) is the third root of unwholesome action. Give to *vītamoha* (those free from delusion) for great fruit.

[25] **Icchādosā**: *Icchā* (desire, wish) parallels *taṇhā* but emphasizes wanting itself. Give to *vigaticchesu* (those without desire) for great fruit. These four verses connect merit-making (*dāna*) with the chapter's theme: support those who have overcome the very craving that imprisons ordinary beings.

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Key Concepts

1. **Taṇhā (Craving)**: The Second Noble Truth's origin of suffering—thirst, desire, craving
2. **Māluvā/Latā**: Vine/creeper metaphors for craving's parasitic, spreading nature
3. **Mūla (Root)**: Deep uprooting required, not mere surface cutting
4. **Taṇhānusaya**: Latent tendency to craving, requiring complete extraction
5. **Taṇhakkhaya**: Craving's destruction—the key to liberation
6. **Three Poisons + Desire**: Passion, hatred, delusion (+ icchā) as the four "weeds"

### Cross-References

- **Mahāparinibbāna Sutta (DN 16)**: The Buddha's final teaching emphasizes craving's cessation
- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 2**: "Expedient Means" addresses the difficulty of understanding root causes

### Historical Context

This chapter gathers teachings central to Buddhist soteriology. Verse 353's "All-Conquering, All-Wise" declaration reportedly represents the Buddha's first utterance after enlightenment, preserved in multiple canonical sources. Verse 354's "gift of Dhamma" hierarchy influenced Buddhist giving practices for millennia—supporting teachers over material offerings.
# Chapter 25: Bhikkhuvagga (The Monk)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Bhikkhuvagga

The twenty-fifth chapter addresses the *bhikkhu*—the Buddhist monk or mendicant—describing the qualities, practices, and attainments that constitute authentic monasticism. The term *bhikkhu* derives from the root meaning "to beg" or "to share," indicating the almsman who depends on householder support while dedicating themselves fully to spiritual practice.

This chapter presents a comprehensive portrait of the ideal monk: restrained in all senses, controlled in body and speech, content with little, devoted to meditation, dwelling in loving-kindness, and ultimately attaining the deathless. It pairs practical instruction (sense-restraint, contentment, spiritual friendship) with philosophical insight (the relationship between concentration and wisdom, the superhuman delight of insight).

The chapter's recurring theme is *saṁvara* (restraint)—a disciplined self-governance that paradoxically leads to freedom. The monk restrained everywhere becomes liberated everywhere.

---

### Verses 360-361: Universal Restraint

**Verse 360**

Restraint of the eye is good;
Restraint of the ear is good;
Restraint of the nose is good;
Restraint of the tongue is good.

**Verse 361**

Restraint of the body is good;
Restraint of speech is good;
Restraint of mind is good;
Restraint everywhere is good.
The monk restrained everywhere
Is liberated from all suffering.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Saṁvaro Sādhu**: The word *sādhu* (good, excellent, well-done) punctuates each line, creating a litany of affirmation. *Saṁvara* (restraint, self-control) is applied to each sense faculty: *cakkhu* (eye), *sota* (ear), *ghāṇa* (nose), *jivhā* (tongue), *kāya* (body), *vācā* (speech), *manas* (mind). The culmination: *sabbattha saṁvuto bhikkhu* (the monk restrained everywhere) *sabbadukkhā pamuccati* (is liberated from all suffering). Note the progression from individual senses to totality—and the promise that comprehensive restraint produces comprehensive liberation.

---

### Verse 362: The True Monk

One who controls their hands, controls their feet,
Controls their speech, controls the mind supreme,
With inner delight and composure,
Solitary, content—that one is called a monk.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **Saṁyatuttamo**: *Saṁyata* (controlled, restrained) governs *hattha* (hands), *pāda* (feet), *vācā* (speech), and ultimately the *uttama* (supreme)—the mind itself. Such a one is *ajjhattarata* (delighting inwardly), *samāhita* (composed, concentrated), *eka* (alone, solitary), and *santusita* (content). The verse describes not external observance but internal transformation: true monasticism is defined by inner state, not merely outer renunciation.

---

### Verse 363: Sweet Speech

The monk who restrains the mouth,
Who speaks thoughtfully, who is modest,
Who explains the meaning and the Dhamma—
Sweet is their speech.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Mukhasaṁyato Bhikkhu**: *Mukha* (mouth) *saṁyata* (restrained) applies both to eating and speaking. *Mantabhāṇī* (speaking thoughtfully, speaking mantras/measured words) and *anuddhata* (modest, not puffed up) characterize their communication. When they *dīpeti* (illuminate, explain) *atthaṁ Dhammañ-ca* (meaning and Dhamma), their *bhāsita* (speech) is *madhura* (sweet, pleasant). Speech restraint doesn't mean silence but thoughtful, meaningful, beneficial communication.

---

### Verse 364: Dhamma-Delight

One who finds pleasure in the Dhamma,
Who delights in the Dhamma,
Who reflects on the Dhamma,
Who recollects the Dhamma—
That monk does not fall away from the True Dhamma.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **Dhammārāmo Dhammarato**: Three Dhamma-relations are enumerated: *ārāma* (pleasure garden, finding pleasure in), *rata* (delighting in), and *anuvicintayaṁ* (reflecting on, thinking about). When one also *anussaraṁ* (recollects, remembers) Dhamma, they *na parihāyati* (do not fall away from) *Saddhammā* (True/Good Dhamma). The repetition of "Dhamma" four times emphasizes complete immersion in the teaching.

---

### Verses 365-366: Contentment with Gains

**Verse 365**

One should not despise one's own gains,
Nor live envious of others.
The monk envious of others
Does not attain concentration.[5]

**Verse 366**

Even if a monk gains little,
They should not despise their gains.
The gods themselves praise
One of pure livelihood who is diligent.[6]

#### Footnotes

[5] **Salābhaṁ Nātimaññeyya**: *Salābha* (one's own gains—alms, offerings, supports) should not be *atimaññeyya* (despised, looked down upon). Nor should one *pihayaṁ care* (live enviously) regarding *aññesaṁ* (others' gains). Why? The *bhikkhu pihayaṁ* (envious monk) *nādhigacchati samādhiṁ* (does not attain concentration). Envy disturbs the tranquil mind required for deep practice.

[6] **Devā Pasaṁsanti**: Even *appalābha* (one of little gain) who doesn't despise their modest portion receives praise from *devā* (gods, celestial beings). *Suddhājīvin* (one of pure livelihood) who is *atandita* (diligent, unwearied) merits celestial approval. The teaching counters material comparison: spiritual success isn't measured by alms received.

---

### Verse 367: Non-Fondness

One who has no possessive fondness at all
For mind-and-body,
Who grieves not for what does not exist—
That one is truly called a monk.[7]

#### Footnotes

[7] **Sabbaso Nāmarūpasmiṁ**: *Nāmarūpa* (name-and-form, mind-and-body) encompasses the totality of psychophysical existence. One who has *natthi mamāyitaṁ* (no "mine-making," no possessive attachment) *sabbaso* (completely, in every way) regarding this, and who *na socati* (does not grieve) *asatā ca* (for what does not exist, for what is absent)—is *ve bhikkhū ti vuccati* (truly called a monk). The verse describes non-attachment to both present existence and absent objects.

---

### Verse 368: Loving-Kindness and Peace

The monk who dwells in loving-kindness,
With faith in the Buddha's teaching,
Should attain the state of peace—
The bliss of stilling all conditions.[8]

#### Footnotes

[8] **Mettāvihārī**: *Mettā* (loving-kindness) as *vihāra* (dwelling, abode) describes the pervading mental state. Combined with *pasanna* (clear faith) in *Buddhasāsana* (Buddha's teaching), such a monk *adhigacche* (should attain) *padaṁ santaṁ* (the peaceful state)—specifically, *saṅkhārūpasamaṁ sukhaṁ* (the bliss of calming/stilling *saṅkhāra*, conditioned phenomena). This names nibbāna in positive terms: not mere cessation but blissful peace.

---

### Verse 369: Bailing the Boat

Bail out this boat, O monk!
When bailed, it will go swiftly.
Having cut off passion and hatred,
From there you will reach Nibbāna.[9]

#### Footnotes

[9] **Siñca Bhikkhu Imaṁ Nāvaṁ**: The self is compared to a *nāvā* (boat) requiring *siñca* (bailing out). Unbailed, water (defilements) makes the boat heavy and slow; *sittā* (when bailed) it *lahuṁ essati* (will go lightly, swiftly). The defilements to remove: *rāga* (passion) and *dosa* (hatred). Having *chetvā* (cut) these, *tato Nibbānam-ehisi* (from there you will go to Nibbāna). The nautical metaphor is apt: the spiritual journey requires continuous maintenance.

---

### Verse 370: The Fives

Cut off five, abandon five,
Cultivate five more.
The monk who surmounts five attachments
Is called "one who has crossed the flood."[10]

#### Footnotes

[10] **Pañca Chinde, Pañca Jahe, Pañca Cuttaribhāvaye**: This numerical verse requires commentary to decode. Traditional interpretation: *chinde pañca* (cut five) = five lower fetters (self-view, doubt, rites-attachment, sensual desire, ill-will); *jahe pañca* (abandon five) = five higher fetters (form-attachment, formless-attachment, conceit, restlessness, ignorance); *bhāvaye pañca uttari* (cultivate five more) = five spiritual faculties (faith, energy, mindfulness, concentration, wisdom). One who *atigo pañca saṅgā* (surmounts five attachments—passion, hatred, delusion, pride, wrong views) is *oghatiṇṇa* (flood-crosser)—the four floods being sensuality, existence, views, and ignorance.

---

### Verse 371: Meditate and Beware

Meditate, O monk! Be not heedless!
Let not your mind swirl in strands of desire.
Heedless, do not swallow the hot iron ball.
Burning, do not cry "This is suffering!"[11]

#### Footnotes

[11] **Jhāya Bhikkhu Mā ca Pāmado**: *Jhāya* (meditate, practice jhāna) and *mā pāmado* (be not heedless)—direct imperatives. *Kāmaguṇe* (strands of sense-desire) should not *bhamassu cittaṁ* (swirl/whirl the mind). The *lohaguḷa* (iron ball) is *gilī* (swallowed) by the *pamatto* (heedless one)—a reference to hell-realm suffering where beings swallow molten iron. The verse ends dramatically: don't wait to cry *dukkham-idaṁ* while *ḍayhamāno* (burning). Practice now; prevent suffering rather than lamenting it later.

---

### Verse 372: Concentration and Wisdom

There is no concentration for one without wisdom;
There is no wisdom for one without concentration.
One who has both concentration and wisdom—
That one is indeed near Nibbāna.[12]

#### Footnotes

[12] **Natthi Jhānaṁ Apaññassa**: This frequently-quoted verse establishes the interdependence of *jhāna* (concentration, meditative absorption) and *paññā* (wisdom, insight). Neither exists without the other; they mutually support and develop together. One who possesses *jhānañ-ca paññā ca* (both) is *Nibbānasantike* (in Nibbāna's presence/vicinity). This teaching counters both anti-intellectual mysticism and dry scholasticism—liberation requires united practice.

---

### Verse 373: Superhuman Delight

For one who has entered an empty place,
A monk with peaceful mind,
There is superhuman delight
When rightly seeing the Dhamma.[13]

#### Footnotes

[13] **Suññāgāraṁ Paviṭṭhassa**: *Suññāgāra* (empty dwelling, empty place) describes the monk's retreat environment. With *santacitta* (peaceful mind), they experience *amānusī ratī* (superhuman, beyond-human delight) when *sammā vipassato Dhammaṁ* (rightly seeing, insight-perceiving the Dhamma). The joy of insight transcends ordinary pleasure—it is literally not-human, belonging to a higher order of experience.

---

### Verse 374: Joy in Impermanence

Whoever rightly attends to
The rise and fall of the aggregates
Gains joy and happiness—
That is the deathless for one who knows.[14]

#### Footnotes

[14] **Khandhānaṁ Udayabbayaṁ**: *Sammasati* (thoroughly attends to, contemplates) the *udaya* (arising) and *vaya* (passing away) of *khandhā* (the five aggregates—form, feeling, perception, formations, consciousness). Such contemplation *labhatī* (obtains) *pīti* (joy, rapture) and *pāmojja* (happiness, gladness). This is *amata* (the deathless, the immortal)—nibbāna—*vijānataṁ* (for those who know). The insight into impermanence produces not depression but liberation-joy.

### Verse 375: The Beginning

This is the beginning here
For the wise monk:
Sense-guarding, contentment,
And restraint in the monastic rules.[15]

#### Footnotes

[15] **Tatrāyam-ādi Bhavati**: The *ādi* (beginning, first step) for *paññassa bhikkhuno* (the wise monk) comprises three elements: *indriyagutti* (sense-faculty guarding), *santuṭṭhī* (contentment), and *saṁvaro pātimokkhe* (restraint in the *Pātimokkha*—the monastic code of 227 rules for monks). This establishes the foundation upon which higher practice builds.

---

### Verse 376: Spiritual Friendship

Resort to spiritual friends,
Those of pure livelihood, those who are diligent.
Be of friendly disposition,
Skillful in conduct.
Then, rejoicing greatly,
You will make an end to suffering.[16]

#### Footnotes

[16] **Mitte Bhajassu Kalyāṇe**: *Kalyāṇamittā* (spiritual friends, noble friends) should be *bhajassu* (associated with, cultivated). Qualities: *suddhājīve* (pure livelihood), *atandite* (diligent). One should be *paṭisanthāravuttassa* (of friendly disposition, hospitable) and *ācārakusala* (skilled in conduct). Result: *pāmojjabahulo* (having much rejoicing), one *dukkhassantaṁ karissati* (will make an end of suffering). Spiritual friendship is not optional but essential to the path.

---

### Verse 377: Casting Off

Just as the jasmine casts off
Its withered flowers,
So, O monks, should you cast off
Passion and hatred.[17]

#### Footnotes

[17] **Vassikā viya Pupphāni**: The *vassikā* (jasmine plant) *pamuñcati* (casts off, releases) its *maddavāni pupphāni* (withered, faded flowers). Monks should similarly *vippamuñcetha* (let go, cast off) *rāgañ-ca dosañ-ca* (passion and hatred). The metaphor suggests naturalness: just as the plant doesn't cling to dead flowers, practitioners shouldn't cling to emotional states that have served their time.

---

### Verse 378: The Peaceful One

Calm in body and calm in speech,
Having calmness and composure,
Having thrown off worldly gain—
That monk is called "one at peace."[18]

#### Footnotes

[18] **Santakāyo Santavāco**: *Santa* (calm, peaceful) describes *kāya* (body), *vācā* (speech), and the person generally (*santavā*). *Susamāhita* (well-composed, concentrated) adds mental stability. *Vantalokāmisa* (having vomited worldly baits—the enticements of gain, fame, praise, pleasure) describes renunciation. Such a *bhikkhu* is *upasanto ti vuccati* (called "one at peace").

---

### Verses 379-380: Self-Governance

**Verse 379**

By oneself one should censure oneself;
By oneself one should examine oneself.
Self-guarded and mindful,
The monk will dwell happily.[19]

**Verse 380**

Self is the protector of self;
Self is the refuge of self.
Therefore control yourself
As a merchant controls a noble horse.[20]

#### Footnotes

[19] **Attanā Codayattānaṁ**: *Codaya* (censure, urge, admonish) *attānaṁ* (oneself) *attanā* (by oneself). Similarly, *paṭimāsettaṁ* (examine, test) oneself by oneself. *Attagutta* (self-guarded), *satimā* (mindful)—such a *bhikkhu* will *sukhaṁ vihāhisi* (dwell happily). External authorities and critics are secondary; the monk must be their own teacher and examiner.

[20] **Attā hi Attano Nātho**: *Attā* (self) is *nātho* (protector, lord) of *attano* (oneself); *attā* is *gati* (refuge, destination) of self. Therefore *saṁyamaya attānaṁ* (restrain yourself) *assaṁ bhadraṁ va vāṇijo* (like a merchant [controls] a noble horse). The teaching emphasizes self-reliance while using the merchant-horse metaphor: value yourself enough to train yourself carefully.

---

### Verses 381-382: Joy and Radiance

**Verse 381**

The monk having much happiness,
With faith in the Buddha's teaching,
Could attain the state of peace—
The bliss of stilling all conditions.[21]

**Verse 382**

The young monk who devotes themselves
To the Buddha's teaching
Illuminates this world—
Like the moon freed from a cloud.[22]

#### Footnotes

[21] **Pāmojjabahulo Bhikkhu**: This verse repeats verse 368's conclusion but emphasizes *pāmojjabahula* (having abundant joy, gladness) as prerequisite. Faith (*pasanna*) in *Buddhasāsana* leads to *padaṁ santaṁ* (peaceful state), the *sukha* (bliss) of *saṅkhārūpasama* (calming formations).

[22] **Daharo Bhikkhu Yuñjati**: The *dahara* (young) *bhikkhu* who *yuñjati* (yokes themselves to, devotes themselves to) the Buddha's teaching *pabhāseti* (illuminates, makes shine) *imaṁ lokaṁ* (this world). The simile: *candimā abbhā mutto va* (like the moon freed from clouds). Young practitioners have special radiance when committed to the path—they shine through the darkness of the world.

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Key Concepts

1. **Saṁvara (Restraint)**: Control of senses, speech, mind—foundation of monastic practice
2. **Jhāna-Paññā Unity**: Inseparability of concentration and wisdom (verse 372)
3. **Kalyāṇamittā**: Spiritual friendship as essential support
4. **Attā hi Attano Nātho**: Self as one's own refuge and protector
5. **Udayabbaya (Rise and Fall)**: Insight into impermanence of aggregates

### Cross-References

- **Satipaṭṭhāna Sutta (MN 10)**: Elaborates the contemplation of aggregates (verse 374)
- **Kalyāṇamitta Sutta (SN 45.2)**: Buddha's statement that spiritual friendship is the "whole of the holy life"
- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 10**: The Dharma Teacher parallels praise of Dhamma-devoted monks
- **Visuddhimagga**: Systematic treatment of sense-restraint and concentration

### Historical Context

The *bhikkhu* was Buddhism's primary social institution: the dedicated renunciant who embodied the teaching and preserved its transmission. This chapter codifies monastic ideals while acknowledging practical challenges (contentment with little, avoiding envy). The balance between self-reliance (verses 379-380) and spiritual friendship (verse 376) reflects ongoing debates in Buddhist communities about the proper role of solitude versus sangha.
# Chapter 26: Brāhmaṇavagga (The Brahmin)

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

### Introduction to Brāhmaṇavagga

The twenty-sixth and final chapter of the Dhammapada redefines *brāhmaṇa* (brahmin)—a term that in the Buddha's India denoted the priestly caste claiming spiritual authority by birth. Through forty-one verses, the Buddha systematically dismantles caste-based claims to holiness, insisting that true brahminhood consists not in birth, rituals, or matted hair but in ethical purity, wisdom, and liberation.

Each verse follows a distinctive refrain: *tam-ahaṁ brūmi brāhmaṇaṁ* ("that one I call a brahmin"). This anaphoric structure creates a cumulative effect—a comprehensive portrait of the liberated person constructed through negative and positive definitions. The chapter represents one of Buddhism's most sustained critiques of social hierarchy, asserting that spiritual status depends entirely on personal realization, not hereditary privilege.

### Verse 383: Cut the Stream

Strive and cut the stream, O brahmin!
Drive away sense-desires.
Knowing the destruction of conditions,
Be one who knows the unconditioned.[1]

#### Footnotes

[1] **Chinda Sotaṁ**: The *sota* (stream) to be *chinda* (cut) is the current of craving that carries beings through saṃsāra. *Parakkamma* (striving, with effort) and *panuda kāme* (drive away sense-desires) are prerequisites. The goal: knowing (*ñatvā*) *saṅkhārānaṁ khayaṁ* (the destruction of conditioned phenomena), become *akataññū* (one who knows the *akata*—the unconditioned, the unmade, i.e., nibbāna). The verse opens the chapter by establishing that brahminhood means liberation, not lineage.

---

### Verse 384: Crossing Over Through Two Things

When a brahmin has crossed over
Through two things,
Then all fetters are laid to rest
For one who knows.[2]

#### Footnotes

[2] **Dvayesu Dhammesu Pāragū**: The "two things" (*dvaya dhamma*) traditionally refer to *samatha* (tranquility) and *vipassanā* (insight), or alternatively to knowledge and conduct. When one is *pāragū* (gone to the far shore) through these, *sabbe saṁyogā* (all fetters) reach *attha* (end, cessation) for *jānato* (one who knows).

---

### Verse 385: Beyond Both Shores

One for whom neither the near shore, the far shore,
Nor both shores exist—
Free of anxiety, detached—
That one I call a brahmin.[3]

#### Footnotes

[3] **Pāraṁ Apāraṁ**: The *pāra* (far shore, liberation) and *apāra* (near shore, saṃsāra) represent the fundamental duality. For the truly liberated, even these distinctions dissolve: *pārāpāraṁ na vijjati* (neither exists as separate realities). *Vītaddara* (free of distress/anxiety), *visaṁyutta* (detached)—such a one transcends all categories.

---

### Verse 386: The Meditator Done

The meditator, seated, dustless,
Duty done, without pollutants,
Having reached the highest goal—
That one I call a brahmin.[4]

#### Footnotes

[4] **Jhāyiṁ Virajam-āsīnaṁ**: The accomplished practitioner *jhāyī* (meditates), is *viraja* (dustless—free from passion), *āsīna* (seated, established), *katakicca* (duty-done), *anāsava* (without pollutants/fermentations). Having *anuppatta* (reached) *uttamattha* (the highest purpose/goal)—nibbāna—that one is truly brahmin.

---

### Verse 387: Radiance Compared

The sun shines by day, the moon glows by night,
The warrior shines in armor,
The brahmin shines in meditation—
But the Buddha shines with radiance all day and night.[5]

#### Footnotes

[5] **Divā Tapati Ādicco**: A graduated comparison: *ādicca* (sun) *tapati* (shines) *divā* (by day); *candimā* (moon) *ābhāti* (glows) *rattiṁ* (at night); *khattiya* (warrior/noble) shines *sannaddho* (armored, equipped); *brāhmaṇa jhāyī* (meditating brahmin) shines. But *Buddha tapati tejasā* (Buddha shines with power/brilliance) *sabbam-ahorattiṁ* (all day and night). The Buddha's radiance is unconditional, continuous, supreme.

---

### Verse 388: Etymology of Names

Warding off wickedness, one is called "brahmin."
Living austerely, one is called "ascetic."
Driving forth one's own stain—
Therefore one is called "one gone forth."[6]

#### Footnotes

[6] **Bāhitapāpo ti Brāhmaṇo**: The Buddha offers folk etymologies: *brāhmaṇa* derives from *bāhita-pāpa* (one who has warded off evil); *samaṇa* (ascetic) from *samacariyā* (living evenly, austerely); *pabbajita* (one gone forth, renunciant) from *pabbājayaṁ malaṁ* (driving forth stain). These are spiritual etymologies—the terms' true meanings depend on qualities, not caste.

---

### Verses 389-390: Non-Violence

**Verse 389**

A brahmin should not strike a brahmin,
Nor should the brahmin retaliate.
Woe to one who strikes a brahmin!
Greater woe to one who retaliates![7]

**Verse 390**

It is no small good for a brahmin
When the mind turns back from what is dear,
Whenever the harmful mind turns back—
There is calming of suffering.[8]

#### Footnotes

[7] **Na Brāhmaṇassa Pahareyya**: True brahmins should neither attack (*pahareyya*) nor retaliate when attacked (*muñcetha*). *Dhī* (woe, shame) falls on both striker and retaliator—but *tato dhī* (greater shame) on the one who strikes back. Non-retaliation is the higher virtue.

[8] **Nisedho Manaso Piyehi**: When the *mano* (mind) achieves *nisedha* (restraint, withdrawal) from *piyehi* (dear things, attachments), and *hiṁsamano* (the harmful mind) *nivattati* (turns back), then *sammati dukkhaṁ* (suffering is calmed). Mental discipline, not external observance, defines brahminhood.

---

### Verse 391: Three Restraints

One for whom there is no wrongdoing
Through body, speech, or mind,
Restrained in these three—
That one I call a brahmin.[9]

#### Footnotes

[9] **Kāyena Vācāya Manasā Natthi Dukkata​ṁ**: The three doors of action—*kāya* (body), *vācā* (speech), *manas* (mind)—produce no *dukkata* (wrongdoing). *Saṁvuta tīhi ṭhānehi* (restrained in three places) describes complete behavioral purity.

---

### Verse 392: Honor the Teacher

From whomever one learned the Dhamma
Taught by the Perfectly Awakened One—
One should respectfully bow to them
As a brahmin bows at the fire-sacrifice.[10]

#### Footnotes

[10] **Sakkaccaṁ Taṁ Namasseyya**: One who teaches *Dhammaṁ* (truth) *Sammāsambuddhadesitaṁ* (taught by the Fully Self-Awakened One) deserves *namasseyya* (homage) *sakkaccaṁ* (respectfully). The simile is pointed: as brahmins bow (*aggihuttaṁ va*) at fire-sacrifice (their central ritual), so should one bow to the Dhamma-teacher. Spiritual teaching surpasses ritual in worthiness of reverence.

---

### Verses 393-394: Not by Externals

**Verse 393**

Not by matted hair, not by clan,
Not by birth is one a brahmin.
In whom there is truth and Dhamma—
That one is pure, that one is truly brahmin.[11]

**Verse 394**

What use your matted hair, O fool?
What use your deerskin garment?
Within you is a jungle—
You polish only the outside![12]

#### Footnotes

[11] **Na Jaṭāhi Na Gottena**: Neither *jaṭā* (matted hair—ascetic marker), *gotta* (clan, lineage), nor *jaccā* (birth) makes a *brāhmaṇa*. Only one *yamhi saccañ-ca Dhammo ca* (in whom truth and Dhamma exist) is *sucī* (pure) and genuinely brahmin. This directly challenges Brahmanical claims to inherited holiness.

[12] **Kiṁ Te Jaṭāhi Dummedha**: The *dummedha* (fool, idiot) cultivates *jaṭā* (matted locks) and wears *ajinasāṭī* (deerskin garment)—external ascetic signs. But *abbhantara* (within) is *gahaṇa* (jungle, thicket)—tangled defilements. *Bāhira parimajjasi* (you polish the outside)—superficial spirituality that neglects inner work.

---

### Verse 395: True Austerity

One wearing discarded cloth,
Lean, with veins visible,
Meditating alone in the forest—
That one I call a brahmin.[13]

#### Footnotes

[13] **Paṁsukūladharaṁ Jantuṁ**: Yet external simplicity combined with genuine practice *is* praise-worthy: *paṁsukūla* (rag-robes, discarded cloth) *dhara* (wearing); *kisa* (lean, thin); *dhamanisanthata* (with tendons/veins spread, visible—from austerity); *eka vanasmiṁ jhāyanta* (meditating alone in forest). The difference from verse 394: here external simplicity accompanies inner practice, not masks its absence.

---

### Verse 396: Not by Birth

I do not call one a brahmin
Merely because of birth from a womb.
That one is just one who says "bho" if attached.
Having nothing, unattached—
That one I call a brahmin.[14]

#### Footnotes

[14] **Na Cāhaṁ Brāhmaṇaṁ Brūmi Yonijaṁ**: The Buddha explicitly rejects *yonija* (womb-born) and *mattisambhava* (mother-originated) as criteria. One with such birth may be merely *bhovādī* (one who says "bho"—the familiar address used *to* brahmins, implying pretension) *sace sakiñcana* (if attached, if possessing). Only *akiñcana* (possessing nothing) and *anādāna* (unattached) qualifies.

---

### Verse 397: Cutting Fetters

Whoever has cut all fetters,
Who surely does not tremble,
Who has surmounted attachments, detached—
That one I call a brahmin.[15]

#### Footnotes

[15] **Sabbasaṁyojanaṁ Chetvā**: *Saṁyojana* (fetters—the ten bonds to existence) *chetvā* (having cut) produces *na paritassati* (no trembling, no anxiety). *Saṅgātiga* (surmounted attachments), *visaṁyutta* (detached)—these are true brahminical qualities.

---

### Verse 398: The Symbolic Bonds

Having cut the thong, the strap,
The rope together with the bridle,
Having thrown off the bolt, awakened—
That one I call a brahmin.[16]

#### Footnotes

[16] **Chetvā Naddhiṁ Varattañ-ca**: A series of bondage metaphors: *naddhi* (thong = hatred), *varattā* (strap = craving), *sandāna* (rope = wrong views), *saha anukkamaṁ* (with bridle = latent tendencies). *Ukkhittapaligha* (thrown off the bolt = ignorance). *Buddha* (awakened) describes the result. This verse decodes spiritual bondage through material imagery.

---

### Verse 399: Patient Endurance

Whoever, being pure, endures
Abuse, imprisonment, and beatings,
With patience as their strength,
With an army of strength—
That one I call a brahmin.[17]

#### Footnotes

[17] **Akkosaṁ Vadhabandhañ-ca Aduṭṭho Titikkhati**: *Akkosa* (abuse), *vadha* (beating), *bandha* (imprisonment)—all *titikkhati* (endures) *aduṭṭha* (without hostility, being pure). Their *bala* (strength) is *khanti* (patience); they possess *balānīka* (an army of strength). Endurance under persecution proves brahminhood.

---

### Verse 400: Trained and Final

Without anger, dutiful,
Virtuous, without swelling,
Trained, in their final body—
That one I call a brahmin.[18]

#### Footnotes

[18] **Akkodhanaṁ Vatavantaṁ**: *Akkodhana* (without anger), *vatavanta* (possessing vows, dutiful), *sīlavanta* (virtuous), *anussuta* (without leakage, taint-free), *danta* (trained, tamed), *antimasārīra* (in final body—no more rebirth)—the complete arahant.

---

### Verse 401: Like Water on Lotus

Like water on a lotus leaf,
Like a mustard seed on a needle tip—
One who does not cling to pleasures—
That one I call a brahmin.[19]

#### Footnotes

[19] **Vāri Pokkharapatte va**: Two similes for non-attachment: *vāri* (water) on *pokkharapatta* (lotus leaf)—doesn't adhere, rolls off; *sāsapa* (mustard seed) on *āragge* (needle point)—cannot remain. One who similarly *na lippati kāmesu* (is not smeared/doesn't cling to pleasures) is brahmin.

---

### Verse 402: Knowing Suffering's End

Whoever knows right here
The destruction of their own suffering,
Having put down the burden, detached—
That one I call a brahmin.[20]

#### Footnotes

[20] **Yo Dukkhassa Pajānāti Idh'eva Khayam-attano**: One who *pajānāti* (knows, understands) *khaya* (destruction, ending) of *dukkha* (suffering) *idheva* (right here, in this very life). *Pannabhāra* (put down burden), *visaṁyutta* (detached)—present liberation, not merely future hope.

---

### Verse 403: Deep Wisdom

The deeply wise, sagacious,
Skilled in what is path and non-path,
Having reached the highest goal—
That one I call a brahmin.[21]

#### Footnotes

[21] **Gambhīrapaññaṁ Medhāviṁ**: *Gambhīra-paññā* (deep wisdom), *medhāvin* (sagacious, intelligent), *kovida* (skilled) in *magga-amagga* (path and non-path—knowing what leads to liberation and what doesn't). Having *anuppatta uttamattha* (reached the highest purpose).

---

### Verse 404: Non-Mixing

One who doesn't mix with householders or the homeless,
Wandering without abode, with few desires—
That one I call a brahmin.[22]

#### Footnotes

[22] **Asaṁsaṭṭhaṁ Gahaṭṭhehi Anāgārehi Cūbhayaṁ**: Not *saṁsaṭṭha* (mixing, associating closely) with either *gahaṭṭha* (householders) or *anāgāra* (homeless ones/monks). *Anokasārin* (wandering without stable abode), *appiccha* (of few desires)—the thoroughly independent practitioner.

---

### Verse 405: Non-Violence

Having laid down the stick
Against beings both fearful and fearless,
Who neither hurts nor kills—
That one I call a brahmin.[23]

#### Footnotes

[23] **Nidhāya Daṇḍaṁ Bhūtesu**: *Daṇḍa* (stick, violence) *nidhāya* (laid down, put aside) toward *bhūtesu* (living beings)—both *tasa* (trembling, mobile) and *thāvara* (still, stationary). *Na hanti* (doesn't hurt), *na ghāteti* (doesn't kill)—complete *ahiṁsā*.

---

### Verse 406: Friendly Amid Hostility

Friendly among the hostile,
Calm among those with raised sticks,
Unattached among the attached—
That one I call a brahmin.[24]

#### Footnotes

[24] **Aviruddhaṁ Viruddhesu**: *Aviruddha* (friendly, non-hostile) *viruddhesu* (among hostile ones); *nibbuta* (calm, cooled) *attadaṇḍesu* (among those with raised sticks, the violent); *anādāna* (unattached) *sādānesu* (among the attached). The brahmin maintains equanimity regardless of context.

---

### Verse 407: Dropping Defilements

Whoever has let fall passion and hatred,
Conceit and contempt,
Like a mustard seed from a needle tip—
That one I call a brahmin.[25]

#### Footnotes

[25] **Yassa Rāgo ca Doso ca Māno Makkho ca Pātito**: *Rāga* (passion), *dosa* (hatred), *māna* (conceit), *makkha* (contempt, hypocrisy)—all *pātita* (dropped, fallen away). The simile repeats: *sāsapo āraggā* (mustard seed from needle)—these cannot hold on; they naturally fall.

---

### Verse 408: True Speech

Whoever speaks words of truth,
Informed and not harsh,
Through which no one is angered—
That one I call a brahmin.[26]

#### Footnotes

[26] **Akakkasaṁ Viññapaniṁ Giraṁ Saccaṁ Udīraye**: Speech (*girā*) that is *sacca* (true), *viññapanī* (informative, clear), *akakkasa* (not harsh). *Yāya nābhisaje kañci* (through which no one is angered)—speech that communicates truth without provocation.

---

### Verse 409: Not Taking

Whether long, short, small, large,
Pleasant or unpleasant—
That one I call a brahmin.[27]

#### Footnotes

In this world or in the next,
Without hope, detached—

One who has no desires,
Who through knowledge is without doubt,
Who has reached immersion in the deathless—
That one I call a brahmin.[29]

#### Footnotes

[29] **Amatogadhaṁ Anuppattaṁ**: *Ālaya* (desires, attachments) *na vijjanti* (do not exist); *akathaṅkathī* (without doubt) through *aññā* (direct knowledge). *Amatogadha* (plunged into/immersed in the deathless) indicates complete union with nibbāna.

---

### Verse 412: Beyond Both Merit and Demerit

Whoever here has overcome attachment
To both merit and demerit,
Griefless, dustless, pure—
That one I call a brahmin.[30]

#### Footnotes

[30] **Puññañ-ca Pāpañ-ca Ubho Saṅgaṁ Upaccagā**: Even *puñña* (merit) and *pāpa* (demerit) represent *saṅga* (attachment) when clung to. The arahant *upaccagā* (surpasses, transcends) both. *Asoka* (griefless), *viraja* (dustless), *suddha* (pure)—beyond all karmic calculation.

Clear and undisturbed—
Having destroyed delight in existence—
That one I call a brahmin.[31]

[31] **Candaṁ va Vimalaṁ Suddhaṁ**: The *canda* (moon) at fullness: *vimala* (stainless), *suddha* (pure), *vippasanna* (clear), *anāvila* (undisturbed, not muddy). One who has *nandībhavaparikkhīṇa* (destroyed delight-in-becoming)—freed from the joy that perpetuates rebirth.

---

### Verse 414: Crossed Over

One who has crossed this difficult path,
This mire, this saṃsāra, this delusion,
Who has crossed over to the far shore,
A meditator, without lust, without doubt,
Without grasping, extinguished—
That one I call a brahmin.[32]

#### Footnotes

### Verses 415-416: Giving Up

**Verse 415**

Whoever, giving up sensual desires,
Would wander here homeless,
Having destroyed sense-desire and existence—

Would wander here homeless,
Having destroyed craving and existence—

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Key Concepts

1. **Redefining Brahminhood**: Spiritual status through realization, not birth—Buddhism's caste critique
2. **Tam-ahaṁ Brūmi Brāhmaṇaṁ**: The refrain establishing personal authority to define holiness
3. **Liberation Markers**: Detachment, extinction of pollutants, knowledge of former lives
4. **External vs. Internal**: Matted hair meaningless; inner transformation essential
5. **Akataññū**: Knower of the uncreated/unconditioned—nibbāna as goal

### Cross-References

- **Tevijja Sutta (DN 13)**: Buddha's debate with brahmins about true brahminhood
- **Assalāyana Sutta (MN 93)**: Extended critique of caste-birth claims
- **Vāseṭṭha Sutta (MN 98)**: "Not by birth is one an outcaste, not by birth is one a brahmin"
- **Lotus Sutra Chapter 12**: Devadatta chapter likewise challenges birth-based status

### Historical Context

This chapter represents one of Buddhism's earliest and most sustained challenges to the Indian caste system. The Buddha's redefinition of brahminhood infuriated traditional brahmins while inspiring countless practitioners who found in Buddhism a path open regardless of birth. The forty-one fold *tam-ahaṁ brūmi* refrain creates a definitive portrait against which all claims to holiness could be measured—not lineage, not ritual, not external marks, but wisdom and liberation.
