# About This Book

The Dhammapada, Verses of the Teaching, is one of the most beloved texts in all of Buddhism. Its 423 verses, organized into 26 chapters, were composed in Pali and transmitted orally for centuries before being written down around the 1st century BCE.

According to tradition, these verses were spoken by the Buddha himself over the course of his 45-year teaching ministry, then gathered by his disciples after his passing. At the First Buddhist Council, held shortly after the Buddha's death, his attendant Ānanda recited the discourses from memory while the assembly verified their authenticity.

For 2,500 years, these words have been memorized, chanted, and lived by practitioners seeking liberation. This interpretation carries that ancient stream into contemporary American English, using the rhythms and imagery of the Blues tradition to let the teaching land where it's meant to land: in the heart.

# A NOTE FROM THE INTERPRETER

You hold in your hands something ancient made new. The Dhammapada was meant to be felt, not just understood. Poetry for the heart, not prose for the intellect.

The Blues comes from a different soil, the Mississippi Delta, the juke joints, the long roads of African American experience. But it carries the same truth: suffering is real, and freedom is possible. You reap what you sow. Your mind creates your world. And the only way out is through.

This translation uses Blues rhythm and Blues language to let these verses hit where they're supposed to hit: in the gut, in the bones, in the midnight hour when you're alone with your thoughts.

Every teaching here is the Buddha's. The voice is the Blues.

May it serve your liberation.

# Chapter 1: The Twin Verses

These verses come in pairs, like the two sides of your life. One side shows you what happens when you get it wrong, the other shows you what happens when you get it right. The Buddha's laying out the whole deal right here at the start: your mind writes the first verse of your life's song, and everything that follows flows from that.

---

## Verses 1 and 2: Mind as the Forerunner

The Buddha said:

"All phenomena are preceded by mind, led by mind, created by mind. If one speaks or acts with a corrupted mind, suffering follows them as the wheel follows the foot of the ox that draws the cart.

All phenomena are preceded by mind, led by mind, created by mind. If one speaks or acts with a pure mind, happiness follows them like a shadow that never departs."

And here's the Blues truth: Everything starts upstairs in your head. Your mind's the boss of this whole operation, the director of your movie, the one writing the first line of every song you sing.

You wake up with poison in your thinking, spite and greed running your show, then open your mouth or make your move—misery gonna follow you like a bloodhound. Like the wheel rolling behind that old ox pulling the cart. Ain't no way to shake it. You created it, now it's tracking you down.

But you wake up with clear water in your mind, kindness and truth running your show, then speak your piece or make your move—joy gonna stick to you like your shadow at noon. Can't lose it even if you tried. That's just how it works.

## Verses 3 and 4: Hatred and Its Cessation

The Buddha said:

"He abused me, he struck me, he defeated me, he robbed me—for those who dwell on such thoughts, hatred is never appeased.

He abused me, he struck me, he defeated me, he robbed me—for those who do not dwell on such thoughts, hatred is thoroughly appeased."

Somebody done you wrong. They lied on you, cheated you, beat you down, took what's yours. That's the truth, that's what happened.

But now you got a choice. You can sit up all night singing that same song: "He abused me, he struck me, he beat me, he robbed me"—play it over and over like a scratched record, let it run through your mind on repeat. You do that? The hate don't never quit. It's gonna grow like mold in a damp basement. Gonna own you more than that person who wronged you ever did.

Or you can know what happened, you can name it true, but you don't gotta rehearse it every day. You don't gotta make it your theme song. You can put that record back in the sleeve. Do that? The hate dies down. Finds its rest. Leaves you free to write a new chorus.

---

## Verse 5: The Ancient Law

The Buddha said:

"For never in this world is hatred appeased by hatred. Hatred is appeased by non-hatred alone—this is the ancient, eternal law."

Let me tell you something about the old laws, the ones that were true before your grandmama was born and gonna be true after your great-grandkids are dust. You can't put out fire with fire. You can't stop hate with hate. Fight poison with poison, all you get is more poison.

Only way to kill that hate is to meet it with something else entirely. Meet it with non-hate. Meet it with love, or at least with letting go. Meet it with "I ain't carrying this no more."

That's the law. Old as the hills. You can buck against it if you want, but it ain't gonna change.

## Verse 6: Awareness of Mortality

The Buddha said:

"Others do not understand that we are perishing here. But those who understand this—for them, quarrels cease."

Most folks walking around don't really get it. We're all dying here. Every one of us. Your time, my time—it's running out while we stand here arguing about who said what and who owes who.

But the wise ones, the ones who've sat with death long enough to know it's real—they stop fighting about small things. When you know you got limited time, when you know this whole thing ends, you ain't got energy to waste on quarrels that don't matter. The argument ends itself when you remember: we're all perishing here.

## Verses 7 and 8: Strength and Māra

The Buddha said:

"One who dwells contemplating the beautiful, with senses unrestrained, immoderate in eating, lazy, lacking energy—Māra overpowers them as wind overpowers a weak tree.

One who dwells contemplating the unbeautiful, with senses well-restrained, moderate in eating, faithful, energetic—Māra cannot overpower them, as wind cannot overpower a mountain."

And here's the Blues truth: Two kinds of people in this world.

The Weak Tree: You spend your days chasing every pretty thing that walks by, letting your eyes, your ears, your tongue run wild like kids with no supervision. You eat too much, sleep too much, can't get yourself to do the hard work. You're like a tree with pretty leaves but rotten roots. First strong wind that comes—temptation, trouble, hard times—you going down. Māra, that's death, that's delusion, that's destruction, gonna knock you right over.

The Mountain: But you train yourself, keep your senses on a leash, eat what you need and no more, get up every day and do the work, build that faith, build that strength—you like a mountain. Storm can howl, wind can blow, rain can come sideways—you ain't moving. Māra ain't got nothing on you. You're planted too deep.

## Verses 9 and 10: The Unfit and Fit for the Robe

The Buddha said:

"One who is not free from defilements yet wears the ochre robe, lacking in self-control and truthfulness—such a one is not worthy of the robe.

But one who has expelled all defilements, well-established in moral conduct, possessed of self-control and truthfulness—such a one is truly worthy of the robe."

You can put on the uniform, wear the robe, the collar, the cross, carry the good book, talk the holy talk. But if your heart's still full of the same old mess, if you ain't done the work to clean yourself up, if you got no self-control, no truth in you—that robe ain't nothing but a costume. You playing dress-up. You don't deserve to wear it.

But if you've spit out all that poison, if you've done the hard work of getting clean, if your life lines up with what you claim, if you got real self-control and real truth in you—then you earned that robe. You got a right to wear it. Not because of the cloth, but because of who you became.

## Verses 11 and 12: Essence and Non-Essence

The Buddha said:

"Those who mistake the non-essential for the essential, and the essential for the non-essential—they do not reach the essential, their thoughts moving in the wrong pasture.

But having known the essential as essential, and the non-essential as non-essential, they reach the essential, their thoughts moving in the right pasture."

Lots of folks out here chasing fool's gold, thinking the shiny stuff is real, thinking the real stuff ain't worth nothing. They mistake pleasure for happiness, money for security, fame for worth, comfort for peace. They running after sapwood, the soft outside of the tree, thinking it's the heartwood, the strong core. They don't never find what they actually need. Too busy chasing what glitters.

But the wise, they can tell the difference. They know heartwood from sapwood, essence from appearance, what matters from what don't. They chase the real stuff: freedom over pleasure, wisdom over information, character over reputation, peace over excitement. And they find it, because they looking in the right place.

## Verses 13 and 14: The Poorly and Well-Thatched Roof

The Buddha said:

"Just as rain penetrates a poorly thatched house, so passion penetrates an undeveloped mind.

Just as rain does not penetrate a well-thatched house, so passion does not penetrate a well-developed mind."

And here's the Blues truth: Your mind is like a house, and desire is like rain.

The Leaky House: You ain't done no maintenance on your mind, ain't trained it, ain't developed it, ain't built up no protection. When the rain of wanting comes, it's gonna pour right through. Soak everything. Ruin your peace. Flood your whole life. You gonna be miserable, sitting there in a puddle, wondering why you're wet.

The Solid House: But you do the work, you train your mind through meditation, develop it through practice, build it strong through discipline. When that same rain comes, it just runs off. Don't get inside. Don't disturb nothing. You stay dry. You stay peaceful. The want comes, but it don't rule you.

## Verses 15 and 16: Sorrow and Joy Here and Hereafter

The Buddha said:

"Here they sorrow, hereafter they sorrow. The evildoer sorrows in both worlds. They sorrow, they are afflicted, seeing the stain of their own deeds.

Here they rejoice, hereafter they rejoice. The merit-maker rejoices in both worlds. They rejoice, they are overjoyed, seeing the purity of their own deeds."

And here's the Blues truth: Two roads, two destinations.

The Sorrow Road: You do wrong—harm folks, lie, steal, destroy—you hurt right now. Conscience eating at you, shame following you around, can't look yourself in the mirror. And you hurt later. When the consequences roll around, and they always do, you hurt even worse. You look at what you did, see that stain on your own hands, and you grieve both places: here and hereafter.

The Joy Road: But you do right—help folks, tell truth, build up, protect—you feel good right now. That clean-conscience peace, that "I did right" satisfaction, looking yourself in the mirror with no shame. And you feel better later. When the good you did comes back around, when you see your deeds were clean, you rejoice even more. Joy here, greater joy there.

## Verses 17 and 18: Burning and Bliss Here and Hereafter

The Buddha said:

"Here they burn, hereafter they burn. The evildoer burns in both worlds. 'I have done evil'—with this they burn, and burn even more having gone to a bad destination.

Here they rejoice, hereafter they rejoice. The merit-maker rejoices in both worlds. 'I have done good'—with this they rejoice, and rejoice even more having gone to a good destination."

And here's the Blues truth: Same teaching, but intensified.

The Burning: You do evil, you burn right now. "I did that terrible thing"—that thought alone scorches you. Then later, when you end up in the bad places, whatever hell looks like for you—addiction, prison, isolation, regret—you burn hotter. The fire don't quit, it grows.

The Bliss: You do good, you rejoice right now. "I did that beautiful thing"—that thought alone lifts you up. Then later, when you end up in the good places, whatever heaven looks like for you—peace, community, freedom, love—you rejoice even more. The joy don't quit, it multiplies.

## Verses 19 and 20: Recitation and True Practice

The Buddha said:

"Though one may recite many sacred texts, if heedless and not practicing accordingly, like a cowherd counting others' cattle, one has no share in the spiritual life.

Though one may recite only a little of the texts, if one practices in accordance with the Dhamma, having abandoned greed, hatred, and delusion, with rightly-knowing mind, well-liberated, clinging to nothing here or hereafter—such a one has a share in the spiritual life."


The Scholar Who Don't Walk: You can memorize every holy book, quote scripture all day long, sound real smart, impress folks at parties. But if you ain't doing it, if you ain't living what you're reading, you like a cowherd counting somebody else's cows. They ain't your cows. That ain't your wisdom. You got no share in the real wealth. All you got is information about somebody else's transformation.

The Practitioner Who Walks: But say you only know a little bit, maybe just one teaching, maybe just the basics—but you live it. You actually give up your greed, you actually let go of your hate, you actually see through your delusions. You practice what you know, you walk what you talk, you get free in your mind, you stop clinging to anything. That's the spiritual life. That's having a share in the wealth. Not what you memorized, but what you became.

## End of Chapter 1

What we learned in these twenty verses lays out the whole program. Mind runs the show. Karma is cause and effect, not divine punishment. Dwelling on grievances keeps you in hell. Only non-hate stops hate. Remember death—it clarifies everything. Train your mind or suffer the consequences. Real worth is internal, not external. Know what actually matters, not what glitters. Build a strong mind to weather life's storms. Practice beats theory every single time.

The Buddha gave us the map in pairs—wrong way, right way—so we can see the choice clearly. Now the work is ours.

The Blues has been teaching this all along. Now you got the Buddhist version too.
