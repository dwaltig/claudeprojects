# Chapter 19: The Just

Not by talking much are you wise. Not by grey hair are you an elder. Not by shaved head are you an ascetic. This chapter strips away external markers and asks: what are you REALLY? The answer is always in the practice, not the appearance.

## Verses 256, 257, 258, and 259: Talking Much Means Nothing

The Buddha said:

"One who hastily settles cases is not one who stands by Dhamma. The wise one discriminates both: what is the case and what is not.

One who settles without haste, justly, impartially—the sagacious one, protecting Dhamma, is called one who stands by Dhamma.

One is not wise merely from speaking much; being safe, hatred-free, fearless—that one is called a wise person.

One is not a Dhamma-bearer from speaking much, but one who, having heard even a little, sees Dhamma for oneself—that is a Dhamma-bearer, not heedless regarding Dhamma."

And here's the Blues truth: Rush to settle a case? That's not Dhamma. The wise one weighs both sides, settles without haste, justly, fair—THAT'S where Dhamma resides.

Talk a lot? That doesn't make you wise. Safe, hatred-free, fearless—THAT'S what makes a wise one rise.

Speak much Dhamma? That doesn't make you a bearer. But hear a little and SEE it in yourself? THAT makes you a Dhamma-bearer. Direct experience matters, not verbal knowledge.

## Verses 260, 261, 262, 263, 264, and 265: Not by Grey Hair

The Buddha said:

"One is not an elder because the head has grey hair; merely well-matured in age, one is 'old in vain.' In whom is truth, Dhamma, non-violence, restraint and training—the wise one who threw out the stain is truly called an elder.

Not by eloquence alone or beautiful complexion is one honorable, if still jealous, selfish, deceitful. For one in whom this is cut off, destroyed at root—that sage who threw out hatred is called honorable.

Not by a shaven head is one an ascetic, if lacking vows, speaking lies, full of greed. One who pacifies wicked deeds, small and great—through pacifying evil is called an ascetic."

And here's the Blues truth: Not by GREY HAIR are you an elder. Just aged? That's old in vain. But with truth, Dhamma, non-violence, restraint and training—THAT'S the elder's domain.

Not by ELOQUENCE or BEAUTY are you honorable. Still jealous, selfish, deceitful inside? Cut that out at the root—THEN you're honorable.

Not by SHAVED HEAD are you an ascetic. Lacking vows, speaking lies, full of greed? Pacify wicked deeds, small and great—THAT'S the ascetic's creed.

## Verses 266, 267, 268, 269, 270, 271, and 272: True Monastics, True Seers

The Buddha said:

"One is not a monastic merely from eating almsfood or undertaking false Dhamma. One who wards off both merit and demerit, walking with discrimination—that one is a monastic.

Not through silence is a fool considered a seer. The wise one, like holding a balance, takes up what is noble. The seer who rejects wicked deeds is a seer; who understands both worlds is called a seer.

Not by hurting living beings is one noble; not hurting any being, one is called noble.

Not merely through virtue, vows, learning, concentration, or secluded dwelling—do I attain renunciation's happiness. Let the monastic not be confident until the pollutants are destroyed."

And here's the Blues truth: Not by eating almsfood are you a monastic. Ward off merit AND demerit, walk with discrimination—THAT'S what makes you fit.

Not by SILENCE is a fool a seer. Hold the balance, take what's noble. The seer rejects wicked deeds, understands both worlds.

Not by HURTING living beings are you noble. Not hurt ANY breathing thing—THAT'S what makes you noble.

Not by virtue, vows, learning, concentration, secluded space—do you achieve renunciation's joy. Don't be confident until the pollutants are DESTROYED. External accomplishments don't guarantee liberation.

## End of Chapter 19

What we learned in these seventeen verses strips away appearances. Not by hastily settling cases do you stand by Dhamma. Not by speaking much are you wise. Not by speaking much are you a Dhamma-bearer. Not by grey hair are you an elder. Not by eloquence or beauty are you honorable. Not by shaved head are you an ascetic. Not by eating almsfood are you a monastic. Not by silence is a fool a seer. Not by hurting beings are you noble. Don't be confident until pollutants are destroyed.

Not by the costume. Not by the title. Not by the talk. What you DO is vital.
