# Chapter 5: Manjushri Comes Calling (文殊師利問疾品)

**Blues Translation by Master John Kim**

---

## The Buddha Sends His Best

Now the Blessed One turned to Manjushri—the sharpest mind in the whole assembly—and said, "You go check on Vimalakirti. See how he's doing."

Manjushri bowed and said, "Lord, that man is something else.¹ He's got wisdom that goes all the way down. His tongue's like lightning and his mind don't miss nothing. He knows every trick in the bodhisattva book and he's been to every corner of the Buddha's treasury. He's whipped every demon that ever came at him and he plays with powers like a child plays with toys.² 

"But alright. If you say go, I'm going."

---

## Everybody Wants to See This

Word spread fast. Every bodhisattva, every elder disciple, every god and spirit in that assembly thought the same thing: *These two titans are about to throw down. This gonna be good.*

Eight thousand bodhisattvas. Five hundred monks who'd heard the truth. Hundreds of thousands of heavenly beings. They all fell in behind Manjushri like a parade heading into Vaishali.

---

## The Empty Room

Now Vimalakirti, he knew they were coming.³ So what'd he do? He cleared out his whole room. Gone. Every chair, every table, every servant—vanished. Just him lying on a single bed, looking pitiful.

When Manjushri walked in, he saw nothing but empty space and one old man playing sick.⁴

Vimalakirti smiled and said, "Well, well! Welcome, Manjushri! You come here without coming. You see me without seeing."⁵

Manjushri didn't miss a beat. "That's right, old man. What's come has already come; what's gone has already gone. There's nowhere to come from and nowhere to go to. But let's set all that aside. The Buddha sent me to ask: How you feeling? That sickness getting better or worse? What started it and how we gonna end it?"

---

## The Only Sickness That Matters

Vimalakirti sat up a little and said, "You want to know where this sickness comes from?⁶ I'll tell you straight.

"It comes from loving too much. See, every living being out there is sick—sick with ignorance, sick with craving, sick with fear.⁷ And because they're sick, I'm sick. If they got healed? I'd be healed too.

"It's like a mama and her only child.⁸ When that child gets sick, mama gets sick. When that child gets well, mama gets well. That's how a bodhisattva loves every being in the universe—like his own child.

"You asked what caused this illness? One word: *compassion*."⁹

---

## The Deepest Blues

Manjushri looked around the bare room. "Why you got no help here? No attendants? Nothing?"

Vimalakirti said, "Because every Buddha-land is just as empty."¹⁰

"Empty how?"

"Empty by emptiness."

"What good is emptiness?"

"It's good because there's nothing to divide up. No this, no that."

"Can you divide emptiness?"

"The dividing is empty too."¹¹

"Where do you find this emptiness?"

"Look in the sixty-two wrong views."¹²

"Where do you find those wrong views?"

"In the liberation of all Buddhas."

"Where's that liberation found?"

"Right in the minds of all suffering beings."¹³

Vimalakirti grinned. "You asked why I got no attendants? Let me tell you: every demon, every heretic—they're all my servants.¹⁴ Demons love staying stuck in birth and death? Well, the bodhisattva stays there too, but different. Heretics love their crazy ideas? The bodhisattva can walk through those ideas without getting scratched."¹⁵

---

## What Kind of Sickness Is This?

Manjushri asked, "This sickness of yours—what's it look like?"

"Can't see it. Got no shape."¹⁶

"Is it in your body or your mind?"

"Neither. The body falls apart anyway—that's its nature.¹⁷ And the mind? The mind's like a magic trick."

"Alright then. Earth, water, fire, wind—which element's making you sick?"

"None of them and all of them.¹⁸ Beings get sick because they got bodies made of these elements. Because they're sick, I'm sick."

---

## How to Comfort a Sick Saint

Manjushri said, "So tell me—how's a bodhisattva supposed to comfort another bodhisattva who's suffering?"

Vimalakirti leaned forward. "You tell him the body don't last—but you don't make him hate his body.¹⁹ You tell him the body suffers—but you don't make him run to nirvana. You tell him there's no self in the body—but you still teach him to help people.²⁰ You tell him the body's empty—but you don't say everything ends in nothing.

"You tell him to repent his old mistakes—but you don't dwell in the past. You feel your own pain and let it open your heart to everybody else's pain.²¹ You remember how long you been hurting and you use that to help others. You stay vigorous. Stay strong. Don't give up.

"Be a healer.²² Cure every sickness you see. That's how you lift up a suffering bodhisattva and make him glad."

---

## Getting Your Mind Right

Manjushri said, "How's a sick bodhisattva supposed to deal with his own mind?"

Vimalakirti lay back and said, "Like this:²³

"He thinks: 'This sickness I got—it comes from old delusions, old cravings, old confusion. There ain't nothing real about it. Who's sick, anyway? This body's just four elements pretending to be one thing.²⁴ Those elements got no owner. This body got no self.

"'This sickness comes from grabbing at "I" and "mine." So let go of that grabbing.'²⁵

"Once you see the root, you stop thinking about yourself as a self. You stop thinking about others as selves too. Then you think about dharmas—just causes and conditions coming together.²⁶ 'This body ain't nothing but patterns. When they arise, just arising. When they fade, just fading. The patterns don't know each other. Nothing says "I'm arising." Nothing says "I'm dying."'

"Then you let go of dharma-thinking too.²⁷ Because even seeing things as dharmas is still a kind of holding on. And holding on is the sickness! So you let that go.

"What's letting go? Letting go of you and yours. How? Stop dividing inside from outside.²⁸ Live in what's equal.

"'Equal' means: the self is empty. Nirvana is empty. They're the same kind of empty—empty in name only.²⁹ When you get this equality, you got no more sickness, except the sickness of emptiness. And that sickness is empty too.

"The sick bodhisattva accepts everything without grasping. He ain't finished his work yet, so he don't check out early."³⁰

---

## Wisdom and Hustle

"When your body hurts, think about beings in the hellish realms.³¹ Let that grow your compassion. Say to yourself: 'If I can tame me, I can help tame them.' Take away their sickness, but don't take away the medicine.³²

"Cut the root of sickness. What's the root? Craving and clinging.³³ What are you craving? This whole three-world casino.³⁴ How do you cut it? By not grasping. If you don't grasp, you don't crave.

"What's 'not grasping'? It's dropping the two views—looking inside, looking outside.³⁵ Drop both. That's freedom.

"Manjushri, that's how the sick bodhisattva works his mind. That's how he ends old age, sickness, and death.³⁶ That's what we call waking up. If he don't do it this way, all his practice is useless. Like a man who thinks he won the fight but never even threw a punch.³⁷

"The one who really defeats old age, sickness, and death? *That's* a bodhisattva."

---

## What Ties You Up, What Sets You Free

Vimalakirti kept going. "The sick bodhisattva should think: 'This sickness of mine ain't real or solid. Everybody's sickness is the same—not real, not solid.'³⁸

"But when you see beings suffering and your heart breaks with love? Check that love. If it's got craving mixed in, if it's got views attached—let it go.³⁹ That kind of compassion will wear you out. You'll get tired of birth and death. But pure compassion? It never gets tired. Wherever you're born, you're not trapped. You can teach freedom because you are free.

"Buddha said it plain: 'You're tied up yourself? You can't untie nobody else. But if you're free? You can set the whole world loose.'⁴⁰

"So don't get tied up.

"What ties you up? Loving the taste of meditation too much.⁴¹ Getting drunk on the quiet.

"What sets you free? Skillful action born from wisdom.⁴²

"Wisdom without skill? Bondage.⁴³ Skill with wisdom? Liberation.
"Skill without wisdom? Bondage. Wisdom with skill? Liberation.

"You building Buddha-lands with craving in your heart? That's bondage.⁴⁴ You building Buddha-lands with a clear mind? That's freedom.

"You planting virtue while you're still tangled up in desire and anger? That's bondage.⁴⁵ You planting virtue after you've cleaned house? And dedicating it to the highest awakening? That's freedom."

---

## Walking the Razor's Edge

"The bodhisattva looks at his body and sees: impermanent, suffering, empty, not-self.⁴⁶ That's wisdom.

"But he stays in birth and death anyway, helping everybody, never giving up.⁴⁷ That's skill.

"He sees the body doesn't leave illness and illness doesn't leave the body.⁴⁸ They're not new and not old. That's wisdom.

"And he keeps living, keeps serving, keeps showing up. That's skill.

"Manjushri, the bodhisattva works his mind this way. He don't rest in 'tamed' and he don't rest in 'wild.'⁴⁹ Resting in wild is what fools do. Resting in tamed is what the small-path folks do.⁵⁰ The bodhisattva don't rest either place. He walks between.

"He lives in birth and death without getting dirty.⁵¹ He abides in nirvana without going extinct. Not ordinary, not holy. Not stained, not pure.⁵²

"He might look like he's doing demon-work—but he's putting demons in their place.⁵³ He seeks all-knowledge, but never at the wrong time. He sees all dharmas as unborn, but he don't slip into the final rest.⁵⁴ He walks through the twisted views like they're nothing.⁵⁵

"He gathers all beings without clinging. He loves solitude but he don't annihilate body and mind. He moves through the three realms without breaking the true nature. He practices emptiness while planting good seeds.⁵⁶ He practices signlessness while saving beings. He practices wishlessness while taking on a body.

"He practices non-arising while doing good. He practices the six perfections while reading every mind. He practices the six powers while staying engaged.⁵⁷

"He touches the four immeasurable hearts without craving heaven. He enters deep meditation without getting stuck there.⁵⁸ He practices mindfulness without leaving body, feeling, mind, or dharma behind. He makes right effort without exhausting himself. He develops the powers while knowing what's sharp and what's dull.

"He walks the Eightfold Path, but his path has no limits.⁵⁹ He practices calm and insight without falling into final peace. He embodies non-arising and non-ceasing, yet he shows up with all the marks of beauty.⁶⁰ He might look like a śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha, but he never abandons the Big Way.

"He follows the pure nature of all things, yet he appears in whatever form is needed.⁶¹ He sees every buddha-land as empty as space, yet he manifests pure lands without end. He wins buddhahood, turns the wheel, enters nirvana—and he never leaves the bodhisattva path."⁶²

---

## The Payoff

When Vimalakirti finished speaking, eight thousand heavenly beings in that assembly woke up.⁶³ Right there, in that bare room, listening to one old man talk about sickness and freedom—they felt it rise in them: the wish to become buddhas themselves.

*That's* what happens when two masters of the Way start throwing truth at each other.

**Theological Note**: This chapter is the heart of the sutra—the meeting of Wisdom (Mañjuśrī) and Skillful Means (Vimalakirti). Their dialogue demolishes every dualism: sick/well, bound/free, arising/ceasing, wisdom/action. The "illness" becomes the teaching. As the Blues says: "The very thing that cuts you is the thing that heals you."
# Chapter 6: The Things You Can't Explain (不思議品)

**Blues Translation by Master John Kim**

## Where We Gonna Sit?

Now Shariputra looked around that bare room and thought: "All these folks came to visit—where they supposed to sit?"

Vimalakirti read his mind. "Shariputra,¹ you here for the teaching or you here for a chair?"

"I came for the Dharma, not a seat."

"That's right!² Someone who really seeks the truth don't crave body or life, let alone somewhere to sit. A true seeker don't look for it in form or feeling or thinking or doing or knowing.³ Don't look for it in the realms of desire or form or formlessness.

"Someone seeking truth ain't attached to finding Buddha.⁴ Ain't attached to finding Dharma. Ain't attached to finding the community. Someone seeking truth don't see suffering to see. Don't cut off the cause to cut off.⁵ Don't realize the end. Don't cultivate the path. Why? Because the Dharma is beyond all that talk.⁶

"You say, 'I'm gonna see suffering, cut the cause, realize cessation, walk the path'? That's just talk. That ain't finding the truth.

"The Dharma is extinction.⁷ If you're practicing birth and death, you're seeking birth and death—not the Dharma.

"The Dharma is unstained.⁸ If you get stained by it—even stained by nirvana—you're missing it.

"The Dharma has no place to act.⁹ If you make it your place, you've lost it.

"The Dharma don't take or leave.¹⁰ If you're taking and leaving, that ain't the Dharma.

"The Dharma has no location.¹¹ If you park yourself somewhere, you missed it.

"The Dharma has no sign.¹² If you're chasing signs, you're chasing the wrong thing.

"The Dharma can't be lived in.¹³ If you're dwelling there, you ain't there.

"The Dharma can't be seen, heard, felt, or known.¹⁴ If you're seeing and hearing and feeling and knowing, that's just seeing and hearing and feeling and knowing—not the Dharma.

"The Dharma is unconditioned.¹⁵ If you practice the conditioned, you're seeking the conditioned.

"Shariputra! Someone who seeks the Dharma should seek nothing at all in any dharma."¹⁶

When he said that, five hundred heavenly beings woke up to the truth.¹⁷

## The Lion Seats from Far Away

Then Vimalakirti turned to Manjushri. "In all your travels through endless worlds—which Buddha-land has the finest lion throne?"¹⁸

Manjushri said, "Way past east—past thirty-six Ganges-worth of worlds—there's a place called Sumeru-Form.¹⁹ The Buddha there is Sumeru-Lamp-King, and he's eighty-four thousand yojanas tall. His throne is just as high, decorated like nothing you ever seen."²⁰

Right then, Vimalakirti worked his power.²¹ And from that distant land, thirty-two thousand lion seats—massive, pure, beautiful—came flying into that little room. Gods and bodhisattvas had never seen anything like it.²²

The room held all of them. No crowding.²³ The city of Vaishali wasn't squeezed. The whole continent wasn't squeezed. Everything looked the same as before—except now there were thirty-two thousand giant thrones in a ten-foot room.²⁴

---

## Some Could Sit, Some Couldn't

Vimalakirti said, "Manjushri, you and the bodhisattvas—take your seats. Just make yourselves big enough to match."²⁵

The bodhisattvas with powers made themselves forty-two thousand yojanas tall and sat down easy.²⁶ But the newbies and the old monks couldn't climb up.

Vimalakirti looked at Shariputra. "Sit down!"

Shariputra said, "Man, this seat is too high. I can't get up there."²⁷

"Bow to Sumeru-Lamp-King Buddha. Then you'll make it."²⁸

So all the new bodhisattvas and disciples bowed to that distant Buddha—and suddenly they could sit just fine.

---

## You Want Inconceivable? Here It Is.

Shariputra's eyes were wide. "This is impossible!²⁹ This tiny room holding these giant seats! The city's not pushed aside. The world's not pressed. How?"

Vimalakirti smiled. "Shariputra, there's a liberation called the Inconceivable.³⁰ When a bodhisattva lives in that liberation, here's what he can do:

"He takes Mount Sumeru—tallest mountain in the universe—and puts it inside a mustard seed.³¹ Sumeru stays the same size. The seed stays the same size. The gods living on Sumeru don't even notice they moved.³² Only those ready to be freed can see it happen.

"He takes all four oceans and puts them in a single pore on his skin.³³ Fish, turtles, dragons—none of them get bothered. The oceans stay as they always were.

"He picks up the whole universe like a clay disc on a potter's wheel and holds it in his palm.³⁴ He throws it past countless worlds, and nobody inside feels a thing.³⁵ Then he puts it back. Nobody remembers traveling.

"He stretches seven days into a whole cosmic age—for beings who need long lives.³⁶ He compresses an age into seven days—for beings who don't need long lives.³⁷

"He gathers the glory of every Buddha-land into one place and shows it to everyone.³⁸ He takes whole populations in his palm and flies through ten directions, showing them everything—and never leaves his spot.³⁹

"He makes visible in one pore all the offerings people make to Buddhas everywhere.⁴⁰ All the suns and moons and stars in the universe—visible in one pore.

"He breathes in all the winds of every world.⁴¹ Body's not harmed. Trees outside don't break.

"When the world burns at the end of time, he swallows all that fire into his belly.⁴² The fire keeps burning, but it don't hurt him.

"He lifts up a whole Buddha-land from the bottom of reality, raises it past countless worlds—light as picking up a leaf on a needle—nothing gets hurt.⁴³

"He shows up as a Buddha, shows up as a solitary sage, shows up as an elder, shows up as a king, shows up as a god.⁴⁴

"Every sound in all the worlds—high, low, in between—he turns them all into the Buddha's voice,⁴⁵ preaching impermanence, suffering, emptiness, no-self. Preaching whatever all the Buddhas preach. Everybody hears it.

"Shariputra, that's the short version.⁴⁶ If I told you everything, I'd still be talking at the end of time."

---

## Old Kashyapa Can't Believe It

Mahakashyapa heard all this and sighed.⁴⁷ He turned to Shariputra and said: "It's like showing colors to a blind man.⁴⁸ He can't see them. That's us—all us elders. We hear about this Inconceivable Liberation, and we can't understand it.

"Any wise person who hears this should want to become a Buddha.⁴⁹ But us? We cut off our roots.⁵⁰ We're like spoiled seeds. We can't grow anymore.

"Every monk who hears this should weep.⁵¹ Our cries should shake the universe.

"But every bodhisattva should rejoice!⁵² Should receive this teaching on the crown of their head. Once a bodhisattva understands this, no demon can touch him."⁵³

When Kashyapa said that, thirty-two thousand gods woke up to the wish for Buddhahood.⁵⁴

---

## The Demons Are Bodhisattvas in Disguise

Then Vimalakirti dropped another bomb.⁵⁵

"Kashyapa! In countless worlds, the ones playing the role of Demon King? Most of them are bodhisattvas in the Inconceivable Liberation.⁵⁶ They use that disguise to teach beings through skillful means.

"And all those beings in countless lands who come begging for hands, feet, eyes, brains, blood, skin, wives, children, treasure?⁵⁷ Most of them are also bodhisattvas testing other bodhisattvas.⁵⁸

"Why? Because a bodhisattva in the Inconceivable Liberation has real power.⁵⁹ He can create trials that look impossible. Ordinary folks can't test bodhisattvas like that.⁶⁰ It's like a dragon-elephant trampling—a donkey couldn't do it.⁶¹

"That's the gate of wisdom and skill for bodhisattvas in the Inconceivable Liberation."⁶²

**Theological Note**: This chapter is pure magic and metaphysics at their most radical. The "Inconceivable" isn't just impressive—it demolishes ordinary reality. The lesson? The world you see isn't fixed. A bodhisattva can remake it at will. And the demons you fear? Might be your teachers in disguise. As the Blues says: "Everything that rises must converge." Even Māra.
# Chapter 7: Looking at Living Beings (觀眾生品)

**Blues Translation by Master John Kim**

---

## How to See Folks

Manjushri asked, "How should a bodhisattva look at living beings?"¹

Vimalakirti said:

"Like a magician looking at the people he conjured up.² Like a wise man looking at a reflection in water. Like staring at your face in a mirror.³ Like a mirage on a hot road. Like an echo bouncing back. Like clouds in the sky. Like foam on water.⁴ Like bubbles rising. Like the core of a banana tree—layers all the way down and nothing solid.⁵

"Like lightning that don't last. Like a fifth great element that don't exist. Like a sixth aggregate nobody ever saw. Like a nineteenth realm that was never there.⁶

"Like form in the formless realm—impossible. Like trying to sprout burnt grain.⁷ Like a stream-enterer with a self-view—contradiction. Like a non-returner getting pregnant.⁸ Like an arhat with desire and hatred.⁹

"Like a patient bodhisattva losing his temper—don't happen. Like a Buddha with leftover habits—ain't real.¹⁰ Like a blind man seeing colors. Like breathing in and out when your mind's been shut down.¹¹ Like bird tracks in the sky—try to find 'em. Like a barren woman's child.¹² Like a magic puppet having real feelings.¹³ Like seeing something in a dream after you woke up. Like a dead man getting a new body.¹⁴ Like fire burning with nothing to burn.

"*That's* how a bodhisattva looks at living beings."¹⁵

---

## What Love Really Means

Manjushri asked, "If you see folks like that, how do you love them?"¹⁶

Vimalakirti said, "You think: 'I'm gonna teach these beings the truth.'¹⁷ *That's* real love.

"Practice the love of silence—because nothing really starts.¹⁸ Practice the love without fever—because there's no affliction.¹⁹ Practice the love of equality—same past, same present, same future.²⁰ Practice the love without fighting—because nothing's arising.²¹ Practice the love of non-duality—inside and outside don't meet.²² Practice the love that can't be broken—because it goes all the way.

"Practice firm love—unshakeable heart.²³ Practice pure love—dharma-nature is pure.²⁴ Practice love without edges—like empty space.²⁵ Practice arhat love—cuts up the thieves of affliction.²⁶ Practice bodhisattva love—brings beings peace.²⁷ Practice Tathāgata love—touches thusness.²⁸

"Practice Buddha love—wakes folks up.²⁹ Practice spontaneous love—no cause needed.³⁰ Practice awakened love—one taste.³¹ Practice matchless love—cuts off craving.³² Practice great compassion love—rolls on the Big Vehicle.³³ Practice tireless love—emptiness and non-self keep you going.³⁴

"Practice giving love—nothing held back.³⁵ Practice discipline love—transforms the transgressors.³⁶ Practice patience love—protects you and protects them.³⁷ Practice effort love—carries beings on your back.³⁸ Practice meditation love—don't get drunk on the bliss.³⁹ Practice wisdom love—knows the right time for everything.⁴⁰

"Practice skillful love—shows everything that needs showing.⁴¹ Practice unconcealed love—straight heart, pure mind.⁴² Practice deep love—no mixed actions.⁴³ Practice honest love—never fake.⁴⁴ Practice joyful love—gives Buddha's own happiness.⁴⁵

"*That's* the bodhisattva's love."

---

## Compassion, Joy, and Letting Go

Manjushri asked, "What's compassion?"⁴⁶

"Sharing everything you've earned with every being."⁴⁷

"What's sympathetic joy?"

"Seeing folks benefit and feeling glad—no regret."⁴⁸

"What's equanimity?"

"Doing good without expecting anything back."⁴⁹

---

## Working Backward to the Root

Manjushri asked, "Bodhisattvas fear birth and death. What should they rely on?"⁵⁰

"Rely on the Buddha's power."⁵¹

"If they want to rely on that power, where should they abide?"

"In freeing all beings."⁵²

"What should they eliminate?"

"The afflictions."⁵³

"How?"

"Right mindfulness."⁵⁴

"How do you practice right mindfulness?"

"Non-arising and non-ceasing."⁵⁵

"What doesn't arise? What doesn't cease?"

"Bad stuff doesn't arise. Good stuff doesn't cease."⁵⁶

"What's the root of good and bad?"

"The body."⁵⁷

"What's the root of the body?"

"Desire and craving."⁵⁸

"What's the root of desire?"

"False discrimination."⁵⁹

"What's the root of false discrimination?"

"Inverted thinking."⁶⁰

"What's the root of inverted thinking?"

"Non-abiding."⁶¹

"What's the root of non-abiding?"

"Non-abiding has no root.⁶² Manjushri—from this rootless root of non-abiding, *all dharmas are established*."⁶³

## The Goddess Throws Flowers

Now, there was a goddess in that room.⁶⁴ She'd been listening to all this. When she saw these great beings receiving the teaching, she showed herself and scattered heavenly flowers all over everybody.⁶⁵

When the flowers touched the bodhisattvas, they fell right off.⁶⁶ When they touched the elder monks, they *stuck*. The monks tried to shake them off, tried to use their powers—nothing worked.⁶⁷

The goddess asked Shariputra, "Why you trying to get rid of those flowers?"⁶⁸

"They ain't proper. They ain't according to the Dharma."⁶⁹

She laughed. "Don't say these flowers are improper!⁷⁰ The flowers don't discriminate—*you're* the one discriminating.'

"Look at the bodhisattvas—the flowers don't stick to them.⁷¹ They've already cut off all that discriminating thought. But y'all still afraid.⁷² When you're afraid, the ghosts can get you. Same with you—you're afraid of birth and death, so forms and sounds and smells and tastes and touches can hold you.⁷³

"Where the habits are gone, the flowers fall off.⁷⁴ Where the habits remain, the flowers stick."

---

## How Long You Been Here?

Shariputra asked, "Goddess, how long you been in this room?"⁷⁵

"As long as you've been liberated."⁷⁶

"That long?"

"Is your liberation old?"⁷⁷

Shariputra went quiet.⁷⁸

"Why's the great wise elder silent?"

"Liberation is beyond words. I don't know what to say."⁷⁹

She said, "Words and letters are liberation too!⁸⁰ Liberation ain't inside, ain't outside, ain't in between. Words are the same.⁸¹ Don't try to separate words from liberation. Everything is liberation."⁸²

---

## Is Liberation Leaving Behind Desire?

Shariputra tried again. "Ain't liberation about leaving behind desire, anger, and delusion?"⁸³

She said, "Buddha said that for proud folks.⁸⁴ For folks without that pride, Buddha taught that the *nature* of desire, anger, and delusion *is* liberation."⁸⁵

Shariputra gasped. "Excellent! Goddess, what have you attained? What have you realized?"⁸⁶

"I've attained nothing. Realized nothing.⁸⁷ That's why I can talk like this. If somebody's got attainment and realization, in Buddha-dharma terms, they're still proud."⁸⁸

---

## The Three Vehicles

"Which vehicle do you aspire to?"⁸⁹

"When I'm teaching with śrāvaka methods, I'm a śrāvaka.⁹⁰ When I'm teaching with solitary-buddha methods, I'm that. When I'm teaching with great compassion, I'm Mahayana.

"Shariputra, it's like walking into a campaka forest—you only smell campaka, nothing else.⁹¹ Walk into this room and you only smell Buddha-merit, not the small-path stuff.

"I've been here twelve years.⁹² Never once heard śrāvaka dharma. Only great compassion. Only the inconceivable. Only Buddha-dharma.

"This room has eight wonders.⁹³

"One: It always glows gold, day and night, no sun or moon needed.⁹⁴
"Two: Nobody who enters gets troubled by defilements.⁹⁵
"Three: Gods and bodhisattvas from everywhere are always here.⁹⁶
"Four: The six perfections are always taught.⁹⁷
"Five: Heavenly music plays, with strings singing the Dharma.⁹⁸
"Six: Four treasuries of jewels supply the poor—never run out.⁹⁹
"Seven: When this man thinks of Buddhas, they come—Shakyamuni, Amitabha, Akshobhya, ten others—they teach the secrets and then go home.¹⁰⁰
"Eight: All the palaces of heaven and all the pure lands appear right here.¹⁰¹

"Who, seeing this, would still want the small path?"¹⁰²

---

## Why Don't You Change Your Body?

Shariputra asked, "Why don't you transform your female body?"¹⁰³

She said, "For twelve years I've been looking for 'female.'¹⁰⁴ Can't find it. What's there to transform?

"It's like asking a magician's illusion, 'Why don't you change your body?'¹⁰⁵ The illusion has no fixed form. What would change?"

Shariputra agreed. "An illusion has no fixed form."

"All dharmas are the same.¹⁰⁶ No fixed form. Why ask about transforming 'female'?"

Then the goddess used her power.¹⁰⁷ She turned Shariputra into herself. She turned herself into Shariputra. And she asked him—now in her body—"Why don't you transform your female body?"¹⁰⁸

Shariputra, looking down at himself, said, "I don't know how this happened!"¹⁰⁹

She said, "If you could transform this female body, then all women could too.¹¹⁰ Just like you aren't female but appear female, all women appear female but aren't.¹¹¹ Buddha said: 'All dharmas are neither male nor female.'"¹¹²

She dropped the power. Shariputra was back to normal.¹¹³

She asked, "Where now is that female body?"

"Neither here nor not here."¹¹⁴

"All dharmas are like that. Neither present nor absent.¹¹⁵ That's what Buddha teaches."

---

## Where Will You Be Born?

Shariputra asked, "When you leave here, where will you be born?"¹¹⁶

"Same as Buddha's transformation is born."

"That's not birth and death."

"Same with sentient beings—no birth and death."¹¹⁷

"When will you become a Buddha?"¹¹⁸

"When you become an ordinary person again."¹¹⁹

"That's impossible."

"Exactly. And it's impossible for me to 'become' a Buddha.¹²⁰ Why? Because awakening has no place to stand. Nobody attains it."¹²¹

"But all these Buddhas—past, present, future—they attained it!"¹²²

"That's worldly talk. Awakening isn't past, present, or future."¹²³

"Shariputra, did you attain arhat-hood?"¹²⁴

"I attained it by not attaining."

"Buddhas and bodhisattvas are the same.¹²⁵ They attain by not attaining."

---

## Who Is She?

Then Vimalakirti spoke up. "Shariputra, this goddess has made offerings to ninety-two billion Buddhas.¹²⁶ She plays with bodhisattva powers. Her vows are complete. She got the patience of non-arising. She can't fall back.¹²⁷ By her vow, she shows up however she wants, teaching and transforming beings."¹²⁸

**Theological Note**: This is the most radical chapter in the sutra. The goddess destroys every category: self/other, male/female, attainer/attainment, liberation/bondage. The Blues knows this wisdom: "What you running from is what you're running toward." She's been empty all along—and so have you.

# Chapter 8: The Buddha's Road (佛道品)

**Blues Translation by Master John Kim**

---

## The Wrong Road Is the Right Road

Manjushri asked, "How does a bodhisattva get to the Buddha's road?"¹

Vimalakirti said, "By walking the wrong road."²

"What does that mean?"

"It means: practicing the five worst crimes without hate.³ Going to hell without guilt. Going to the animal realm without stupidity.⁴ Going to the hungry ghost realm full of merit. Walking through the heavens without thinking you're special.⁵

"It means: showing desire but staying clean.⁶ Showing anger but holding no grudge.⁷ Showing confusion but staying wise.⁸ Showing greed but giving everything away. Breaking rules but keeping the precepts perfectly.⁹

"Showing laziness but working harder than anyone.¹⁰ Showing distraction but staying focused. Showing stupidity but understanding everything.¹¹ Showing flattery but following the sutras. Showing pride but being a bridge for everyone.¹²

"Showing all the afflictions but keeping a clean heart.¹³ Looking like you're with the demons but following Buddha's wisdom.¹⁴ Looking like a small-path elder but teaching new dharmas nobody's heard.¹⁵

"Looking poor but having inexhaustible treasure.¹⁶ Looking disabled but having all the beautiful marks. Looking lowborn but being from the Buddha's family.¹⁷ Looking weak and ugly but having a god's body everyone loves to see.¹⁸ Looking old and sick but cutting off the root of illness forever.¹⁹

"Looking rich but not craving a thing. Having wives and servants but staying out of the mud of desire.²⁰ Looking slow but having perfect speech that never fails.²¹ Looking like you're on the crooked path but using the straight path to save beings.²² Looking like you entered nirvana but never cutting off birth and death.²³

"Manjushri, *that's* how you walk the Buddha's road."

---

## Where Does Buddha-Nature Grow?

Then Vimalakirti asked Manjushri, "What's the seed of Buddhahood?"²⁴

Manjushri said, "The body is the seed.²⁵ Ignorance is the seed. Craving is the seed.²⁶ Desire, anger, and confusion are seeds. The four upside-down views are seeds.²⁷ The five hindrances are seeds.²⁸ The six senses are seeds. Everything wrong is a seed.²⁹

"In short: the sixty-two wrong views and all afflictions—*all of them* are Buddha-seeds."³⁰

"What does that mean?"

"If someone sees the unconditioned and settles into the final rest, they can't arouse the Buddha-aspiration anymore.³¹ It's like high dry ground—lotuses don't grow there.³² They grow in swamps. In low wet mud.³³

"Beings who settle into the unworldly can't give birth to buddha-dharma.³⁴ It's *in the mud of affliction* that Buddha-dharma sprouts!³⁵

"You plant seeds in empty space? They'll never grow.³⁶ Plant 'em in manure—they'll flourish.

"Someone with a mountain-sized ego can still wake up.³⁷ The one who's already 'peaceful' can't move an inch.

"So understand: *All afflictions are the Tathagata's seeds.*³⁸

"You don't dive into the ocean, you don't get the pearl.³⁹ You don't dive into the ocean of affliction, you don't get the jewel of all-knowledge."

---

## Kashyapa Cries

Mahakashyapa called out, "Wonderful, Manjushri!⁴⁰ You said it plain: dust and toil are the Buddha's seeds!⁴¹

"But us? We can't grow anymore.⁴² Even people who commit the worst crimes can wake up.⁴³ We can't. We cut off too much.⁴⁴

"It's like a man who wrecked his senses—the five pleasures can't move him anymore.⁴⁵ That's us. The knots are cut. Buddha-dharma can't benefit us.⁴⁶ We'll never aspire to the great path.

"Ordinary folks can come back.⁴⁷ Śrāvakas can't. Why? Because ordinary people hear the Dharma and can still want the unsurpassed.⁴⁸ We've heard it all our lives—the powers, the fearlessnesses—and we'll never aspire to the great."⁴⁹

---

## The Bodhisattva's Family Tree

Then a bodhisattva named Universal Manifestation asked Vimalakirti, "Who's your family?⁵⁰ Your parents, wife, kids, servants, horses, carriages—where are they?"⁵¹

Vimalakirti answered in verse:⁵²

---

*Wisdom is my mama,*  
*Skillful means is my daddy.*  
*Every guide of beings*  
*Is born from these two.*⁵³  

*Dharma-joy is my wife,*  
*Compassion is my daughter.*  
*Truth in the heart is my son,*  
*Emptiness is my home.*⁵⁴  

*My disciples are the dust of the world,*  
*Turned wherever I want 'em.*  
*The path-factors are my real friends—*  
*Through them I woke up.*⁵⁵  

*The perfections are my crew,*  
*The four hooks are my backup singers.*  
*Chanting dharma-words—*  
*That's my music.*⁵⁶  

*Dharani-groves are my garden,*  
*Outflow-free trees are my forest.*  
*Beautiful awakening-flowers bloom there,*  
*Liberation-fruit grows sweet.*⁵⁷  

*Eight liberations are my bathing pool,*  
*Concentration-water fills it up.*  
*Seven purity-flowers float there—*  
*Washing the ones who're clean.*⁵⁸  

*Five powers are my horses,*  
*The Big Vehicle is my ride.*  
*One-pointed mind holds the reins,*  
*Rolling down the Eightfold Road.*⁵⁹  

*Marks and signs are my decoration,*  
*Good qualities dress me up.*  
*Shame and conscience are my best robe,*  
*Deep vow is my crown.*⁶⁰  

*Seven treasures are my wealth,*  
*Teaching makes 'em grow.*  
*Practice what you hear—*  
*That's real profit-sharing.*⁶¹  

*Four jhanas are my bed,*  
*Born from pure livelihood.*  
*Much learning makes me wise—*  
*That's the sound of waking up.*⁶²  

*Dharma-dew is my food,*  
*Liberation-taste is my drink.*  
*Pure mind is my bath,*  
*Precepts are my perfume.*⁶³  

*I crush the bandits of affliction—*  
*Ain't nobody braver.*  
*I beat four kinds of demons—*  
*Victory flag flying at the training ground.*⁶⁴  

*Knowing nothing rises or falls,*  
*Yet I show up like I was born.*  
*In every land I appear—*  
*Like the sun, missing nothing.*⁶⁵  

*I make offerings in ten directions*  
*To all Buddhas and all beings—*  
*Between them and me,*  
*No line drawn.*⁶⁶  

*Knowing all Buddha-lands are empty,*  
*Knowing all beings are empty—*  
*Still I build pure lands,*  
*Still I teach the crowds.*⁶⁷  

*Every kind of creature—*  
*Their sounds and ways—*  
*A fearless bodhisattva*

# Chapter 9: The Gate of Not-Two (入不二法門品)

**Blues Translation by Master John Kim**

---

## The Question

Vimalakirti looked around at all the bodhisattvas gathered in that room and said:

"Alright now. Each of you tell me: How does a bodhisattva enter the gate of not-two?"¹

---

## Thirty-One Try to Say It

**Dharma-Sovereignty Bodhisattva** stood up first:²

"Birth and death look like two.³ But nothing's ever really born, so nothing really dies. Get that patience of non-arising—that's entering not-two."

**Virtue-Guardian Bodhisattva** said:⁴

"'Me' and 'mine' look like two. But if there's no 'me,' there's nothing that's 'mine.' That's entering not-two."

**Unblinking Bodhisattva** said:⁵

"Taking and not-taking look like two. But if you can't take anything, there's nothing to give or get, nothing to do. That's entering not-two."

**Virtue-Crown Bodhisattva** said:⁶

"Dirty and clean look like two. But see the truth of dirty and there's no clean to compare it to. That's entering not-two."

**Good Constellation Bodhisattva** said:⁷

"Movement and thought look like two. No movement, no thought. No thought, no dividing. That's entering not-two."

**Good Eye Bodhisattva** said:⁸

"One and nothing look like two. But knowing 'one' is 'nothing,' not grabbing nothing, just entering equality—that's not-two."

**Wondrous Arm Bodhisattva** said:⁹

"Bodhisattva-mind and śrāvaka-mind look like two. But see the mind's as empty as magic—no bodhisattva-mind, no śrāvaka-mind. That's entering not-two."

**Pushya Bodhisattva** said:¹⁰

"Good and bad look like two. Don't create good, don't create bad. Enter the signless realm. That's not-two."

**Lion Bodhisattva** said:¹¹

"Sin and merit look like two. Understand the nature of sin and it's no different from merit. Vajra-wisdom cuts through: not bound, not freed. That's entering not-two."

**Lion-Mind Bodhisattva** said:¹²

"Outflows and no-outflows look like two. When all dharmas are equal, you don't think 'outflows' or 'no outflows.' Don't grab signs, don't live in signlessness. That's entering not-two."

**Pure Understanding Bodhisattva** said:¹³

"Conditioned and unconditioned look like two. Leave all counting behind. Mind like empty space. Pure wisdom with no walls. That's entering not-two."

**Narayana Bodhisattva** said:¹⁴

"World and beyond-world look like two. But the world's nature is empty—that IS beyond. No in, no out, no overflow, no scatter. That's entering not-two."

**Good Intention Bodhisattva** said:¹⁵

"Birth-and-death and nirvana look like two. See the nature of birth-and-death: no birth, no death, no binding, no freeing, no arising, no ceasing. That's entering not-two."

**Present Vision Bodhisattva** said:¹⁶

"Used up and not-used-up look like two. Whether dharmas are finished or not, both are the mark of not-finished. Not-finished is empty. That's entering not-two."

**Universal Guardian Bodhisattva** said:¹⁷

"Self and no-self look like two. Self can't be found—how can no-self be found? See the real nature of self and you stop making two. That's entering not-two."

**Lightning-Sky Bodhisattva** said:¹⁸

"Dark and light look like two. The real nature of dark is light. And light can't be grabbed either. Equal and not-two. That's entering."

**Joyful Vision Bodhisattva** said:¹⁹

"Form and emptiness of form look like two. But form IS emptiness. Not that form stops and then there's emptiness—form's nature is always empty. Same with feeling, perception, action, consciousness. That's entering not-two."

**Light-Characteristic Bodhisattva** said:²⁰

"The four elements and space look like two things. But the nature of earth-water-fire-wind IS the nature of space. Past, present, future—all empty. Know the elements like this—that's not-two."

**Wondrous Intention Bodhisattva** said:²¹

"Eye and what it sees look like two. Know the nature of the eye and you got no craving, anger, or confusion about forms. Same with ear/sound, nose/smell, tongue/taste, body/touch, mind/thoughts. Know mind-nature and you're done with craving about anything. Rest there. That's not-two."

**Inexhaustible-Intention Bodhisattva** said:²²

"Giving and dedicating look like two. But the nature of giving IS dedication. Same with discipline, patience, energy, meditation, wisdom. Enter the one-mark—that's entering not-two."

**Deep-Wisdom Bodhisattva** said:²³

"Emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness look like three. But empty is signless. Signless is wishless. When those three are one, there's no mind, no intention, no consciousness. One liberation-gate is three gates. That's entering not-two."

**Quiescent-Faculties Bodhisattva** said:²⁴

"Buddha, Dharma, Sangha look like three. But Buddha is Dharma. Dharma is Sangha. All three are unconditioned, equal with space. All dharmas are like this. Follow this—that's entering not-two."

**Unobstructed-Mind Bodhisattva** said:²⁵

"Body and body's ending look like two. But body IS its ending. See the real mark of the body and you don't think 'body' or 'ending.' Not-two and undivided. No fear. That's entering."

**Superior-Good Bodhisattva** said:²⁶

"Body-karma, speech-karma, mind-karma look like three. All three are actionless. Body's actionlessness is speech's. Speech's is mind's. These three's actionless nature is all dharmas' actionless nature. Follow this wisdom—that's entering not-two."

**Merit-Field Bodhisattva** said:²⁷

"Good action, bad action, unmoved action look like three. All three are empty. Empty has no good, no bad, no unmoved. Don't arise these three—that's entering not-two."

**Flower-Adornment Bodhisattva** said:²⁸

"From 'self' arises 'two'—that's duality. See the real nature of self and you don't make two. No dwelling in two, no consciousness, no object of consciousness. That's entering not-two."

**Virtue-Treasury Bodhisattva** said:²⁹

"Having 'attainment' is duality. Without attainment, no taking, no giving. That's entering not-two."

**Moon-Above Bodhisattva** said:³⁰

"Dark and bright look like two. No dark, no bright, no two. Like in deep cessation—no dark, no bright. All dharmas like that. Enter through equality—that's not-two."

**Jewel-Seal-Hand Bodhisattva** said:³¹

"Loving nirvana and hating the world look like two. Don't love nirvana, don't hate the world—no two. If there was bondage, there'd be liberation. But if there was never any bondage, who's seeking freedom? No bondage, no freedom, no like, no dislike. That's entering not-two."

**Jewel-Crown-King Bodhisattva** said:³²

"Right path and wrong path look like two. Stand on the right path without sorting 'this is wrong, this is right.' Leave both behind. That's entering not-two."

**Delighting-in-Reality Bodhisattva** said:³³

"Real and unreal look like two. Someone who really sees doesn't even see 'real'—forget 'unreal.' It ain't the meat-eye seeing this. Wisdom-eye sees. And wisdom-eye: no seeing, no not-seeing. That's entering not-two."

---

## Manjushri Speaks

Everybody finished. They turned to Manjushri.³⁴ "Alright, Wisdom-King—what's your answer?"

Manjushri said:³⁵

"The way I see it: about all dharmas—no words, no explanation, no pointing, no knowing, no questions, no answers. *That's* entering the gate of not-two."

---

## Vimalakirti's Answer

Then Manjushri turned to Vimalakirti.³⁶

"We've all said our piece. Now it's your turn. How does a bodhisattva enter the gate of not-two?"

.

.

.

Vimalakirti said nothing.³⁷

.

.

.

Total silence.

.

.

.

Manjushri bowed.³⁸

"Excellent! *Excellent!* Not a single letter. Not a single word. *This* is truly entering the gate of not-two."

---

## What Happened

When this teaching was spoken, five thousand bodhisattvas in that assembly entered the gate of not-two and got the patience of non-arising.³⁹

---

## Endnotes: Blues to Buddhist Bridges

18. **Lightning-Sky Bodhisattva** — *Vidyut-ākāśa*—swift and spacious like lightning across the sky.

19. **Joyful Vision Bodhisattva** — *Prīti-darśin*—seeing with joy. This bodhisattva quotes the Heart Sutra's core teaching: "Form is emptiness."

34. **"Turned to Manjushri"** — After 31 attempts, they ask the Wisdom-King himself.

35. **"No words, no explanation"** — Manjushri's answer is the most refined verbal response possible: pointing away from words while still using them. He's *talking about* not talking.

36. **"Now it's your turn"** — The setup for the most famous moment in Buddhist literature. Everyone leans in.

37. **"Vimalakirti said nothing"** — The thunderous silence. After 31 verbal explanations and Manjushri's "no words" explanation (which was still words!), Vimalakirti demonstrates non-duality by not speaking at all. His silence IS the teaching—not *about* it, but *it*.

38. **"Manjushri bowed"** — The wisest being in the assembly recognizes that silence defeated speech. Vimalakirti wins by not playing the game.

39. **"Five thousand woke up"** — The mass awakening that follows real dharma. When truth is demonstrated rather than described, minds open.

---

**Theological Note**: This is the climax of the entire sutra and one of the most important moments in all Mahayana Buddhism. For 2,000 years, teachers have pointed to this silence as the truest teaching. 

The Blues knows this wisdom too: "Sometimes the best thing to say is nothing at all." When words fail—when you've lost someone, when the doctor gives the diagnosis, when love breaks—silence isn't absence. It's presence too deep for sound.

Vimalakirti's silence isn't "I don't know" or "I refuse to answer." It's the sound of a gate opening that has no hinges.

Every bodhisattva *talked* about not-two. Manjushri *talked* about not talking about not-two. Vimalakirti? He just *showed* it.

That's the difference between describing water and being wet.
