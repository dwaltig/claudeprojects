#### Key Themes Covered

1. **Skillful Means (方便)**: Central theme of the chapter. Vimalakirti demonstrates that any context—secular or sacred—can become a field for awakening activity. He enters gambling halls, brothels, wine houses—not to partake but to teach.

2. **Lay Awakening**: Vimalakirti exemplifies awakening while living as a householder with wife, children, and wealth. This challenges the assumption that renunciation is required for liberation.

3. **Illness as Teaching Device**: Vimalakirti's manifested illness is skillful means—he uses "sickness" to attract visitors and create an occasion for Dharma teaching. His illness mirrors the illness of all beings bound by delusion.

4. **Body Meditation**: The twelve similes for the body (foam, bubble, mirage, plantain, illusion, dream, shadow, echo, cloud, lightning, etc.) provide a powerful sequence for contemplating impermanence and emptiness.

5. **Buddha-Body as Dharma-Body**: The culminating teaching that the Buddha's true body is the Dharma-body—truth itself, born from immeasurable pure qualities.

#### Translation Notes

- Source text located in `T0475_001.txt` (lines 134-159)
- Chapter is relatively short compared to later chapters
- Sets up the central drama of the sutra: Vimalakirti is ill, and someone must visit him

## Next Steps

The next chapter is **Chapter 3: Disciples (弟子品)**, which narrates how each of the Buddha's great disciples declines to visit Vimalakirti because each has been humiliated by him in past encounters. This is a lengthy chapter with many individual stories.

## Project Status Update
