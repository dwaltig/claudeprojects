# Chapter 13: Dharma Offering (The Real Payment)

**Blues Vernacular Translation by Master John Kim**

---

## 1. Indra Puts His Money Down

Indra—the King of Kings, the Big Spender of the Heavens—steps out of the VIP section.
He says, "Boss, I've heard a lot of preaching in my time. I've heard the hits, the B-sides, and the deep cuts. But I ain't never heard a track like *this*.
"This ain't just words. This is Reality.
"I’m telling you right now: anybody who picks up this song, learns the lyrics, and starts singing it for real... they got it made. They shut down the road to Hell and open up the highway to Heaven.
"So, here’s my promise: World Honored One, if anybody out there is keeping it real with this Sutra—whether they’re in the projects, the suburbs, the woods, or the desert—me and my crew will cover 'em. We’ll be their security detail. We’ll be their roadies. We got their back."

The Buddha smiles. "That’s cool, Indra. I appreciate that. Because this song? This is where all the Buddhas come from. It’s the Source Code.
"Indra, imagine the whole galaxy packed tight with Buddhas—like rush hour on the subway, shoulder to shoulder.
"Now imagine somebody spends a billion years buying them lunch, building them gold statues, and throwing ticker-tape parades. That’s a lot of merit, right? That’s a heavy payout."

Indra nods. "Huge. You couldn't calculate that tax return."

"Well," says the Buddha, "if somebody listens to this Sutra, really *gets* it, and lives it? That merit is bigger.
"Why? Because offering lunch feeds a body. Offering the Truth feeds the Soul. And the Soul is where the Buddhas are born."

## 2. The Prince Who Paid in Full

"A long time ago," says the Buddha, "way back in the day, there was a Buddha named **Medicine King**. His world was called 'Decorated to the Nines'.
"There was a King named **Precious Canons** who ruled everything. He had a thousand sons—all strong, all handsome, all ready to rumble.

"The King and his sons spent five eons serving the Medicine King Buddha. I mean, they catered every meal, built every temple, paid every bill.
"After five eons, the King says, 'Alright boys, keep it up. Don't stop now.'
"So they did another five eons. Imagine that. Ten eons of picking up the check.

"But one son, a prince named **Moon Canopy**, started thinking: 'Is this it? Is writing checks the best I can do? Ain't there a higher level to this game?'
"Suddenly, a voice from the sky says: 'Yeah, kid. It’s called the **Dharma Offering**.'
"Moon Canopy says, 'What's that?'
"The voice says, 'Go ask the Medicine King.'

"So Moon Canopy goes to the Buddha and asks, 'Boss, what is the supreme offering? What’s the Real Payment?'

"The Medicine King looks at him and says:
'Listen close, kid.
'The Real Payment isn't gold. It isn't incense. It isn't building a cathedral.
'The Real Payment is **understanding the deep tracks**.
'The teachings that are hard to believe. The ones that scare the squares. The ones that say there is **No Self, No Person, No Soul, and No Life**.
'The teachings that say everything is Empty, but you gotta keep working anyway.
'The teachings that tell you to stand on the corner and preach freedom to the slaves.
'When you protect *that* Truth—when you explain it, live it, and defend it against the fakes and the phonies—that is the Dharma Offering.

'It means you follow the **12-Bar Blues of Causality**:
Ignorance leads to action.
Action leads to consciousness.
Consciousness leads to trouble.
...And it all leads to death.
'But you look at that cycle and you don't blink. You see it’s all empty. You break the chain.
'You rely on the **Meaning**, not just the fancy words.
'You rely on **Wisdom**, not just your brain.
'You rely on the **Truth**, not the charismatic preacher.
'You protect the Music, not the record label.
'That, my son, is the Real Payment.'"

## 3. The Big Reveal

"Prince Moon Canopy heard that, and his mind just snapped open. He got the groove.
"He took off his Rolex, his chains, his crown—threw 'em all at the Buddha's feet.
"He said, 'I'm done with the toy money. I’m playing for keeps. After you’re gone, Boss, I’m gonna guard this City. I’m gonna keep the Music alive.'

"And he did. He became a monk. He preached that gospel for ten eons. He saved millions of people.
"Now, Indra, ask yourself: Who was that King? Who were those thousand sons?
"The King is now the Buddha **Precious Flame**.
"The thousand sons are the thousand Buddhas of this age—starting with Krakucchanda and ending with Rucika.
"And that one prince? Moon Canopy? **That was Me.**

"So take it from me, Indra. I didn't get here by writing checks. I got here by laying my life down for the Truth.
"That’s the only offering that counts."

## Blues Commentary: The Real Payment

This chapter hits hard on a common misunderstanding in religion (and in the music business).
People think if they pay enough money, buy enough merch, or build enough statues, they’re "good."
That’s **Material Offering** (*Āmiṣa-Pūjā*). It’s nice. It keeps the lights on. But it doesn't get you free.

The Buddha says the only thing that matters is the **Dharma Offering** (*Dharma-Pūjā*).
In Jazz terms: You can buy the sax player a drink, but the real respect is **listening to what he’s playing**.
Or better yet: **picking up a horn and playing it yourself**.

The "Four Reliances" mentioned here are the musician's code:
1.  **Rely on the Dharma, not the Person**: Don't worship the rockstar; worship the music.
2.  **Rely on the Meaning, not the Words**: Don't get hung up on the lyrics if you miss the soul.
3.  **Rely on Wisdom, not Consciousness**: Don't just think about it; *feel* it.
4.  **Rely on the Definitive, not the Provisional**: Don't settle for the pop single; go for the deep cut.

Making a donation is easy. Changing your mind? That’s the hard work. That’s the Real Payment.

### Song: The Coin in the Cup (Ain't Enough)

(A stripped-down acoustic blues. Just a guitar and a voice.)

**(Verse 1)**
I put a dollar in the poor man’s hat
I built a steeple, nice and fat
I bought a candle and I watched it burn
Thinking I’d get a little grace in return
But the sky stayed empty and the night stayed cold
And all I had was a story told

**(Chorus)**
'Cause the coin in the cup ain't enough, my friend
No, the coin in the cup ain't enough
You can buy the wine, you can buy the bread
But you can't buy a pillow for your weary head
The Real Payment is the blood and the sweat
It’s the hardest Truth you ain't learned yet

**(Verse 2)**
The Preacher told me, "Son, just give
And you shall surely learn to live"
But the Medicine King, he pulled me aside
He said, "There’s a deeper river, wide and wide.
It ain't about the gold on the altar shelf
It’s about the dying of your very self."

**(Chorus)**
'Cause the coin in the cup ain't enough, my friend
No, the coin in the cup ain't enough
You can pay the band, you can pay the bar
But you can't pay the distance to the morning star
The Real Payment is lifting the load
It’s walking the miles on the dusty road

**(Bridge)**
Rely on the Music, not the man
Rely on the Meaning, doing what you can
Throw your jewels in the dust and dirt
The only offering is to heal the hurt

**(Outro)**
I’m done with the silver.
I’m done with the gold.
I’m giving you the story... that can't be sold.
Yeah.
(Guitar fades on a bent note)
