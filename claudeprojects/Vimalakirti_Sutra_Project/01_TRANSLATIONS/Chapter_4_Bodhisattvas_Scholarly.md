## Maitreya Declines

Maitreya addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, I was expounding to the Tuṣita Heaven king and his retinue the practices of the stage of non-retrogression.² At that time, Vimalakirti came and said to me:

"'Maitreya! The World-Honored One has given you the prediction that in one more lifetime you will attain *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*.³ Which lifetime is it that you received the prediction regarding? Is it the past lifetime? The future lifetime? Or the present lifetime?

"'If it is the past lifetime, the past lifetime has already perished. If it is the future lifetime, the future lifetime has not yet arrived. If it is the present lifetime, the present lifetime does not abide.⁴ As the Buddha has said: "Bhikṣu! In this very moment you are also being born, also aging, and also dying."⁵

"'If you received the prediction on the basis of non-arising,⁶ then non-arising is precisely the ultimate position.⁷ In the ultimate position, there is neither receiving prediction nor attaining *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. How then did Maitreya receive the one-lifetime prediction?

"'Did you receive the prediction from thusness arising or from thusness ceasing?⁸ If you received the prediction from thusness arising, thusness does not arise. If you received the prediction from thusness ceasing, thusness does not cease.

"'All sentient beings are thusness.⁹ All dharmas are also thusness. All holy sages are also thusness. And Maitreya is also thusness. If Maitreya receives a prediction, all sentient beings should also receive a prediction. Why is this so? Thusness is non-dual and non-different.¹⁰ If Maitreya attains *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*, all sentient beings should also attain it. Why is this so? All sentient beings are precisely the characteristic of bodhi.¹¹ If Maitreya attains nirvāṇa, all sentient beings should also attain nirvāṇa. Why is this so? All buddhas know that all sentient beings are ultimately quiescent, that this is the characteristic of nirvāṇa—there is no further extinction to undergo.¹²

"'Therefore, Maitreya! Do not seduce these deva-sons with this teaching. In reality, no one generates the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*, and no one retrogresses from it. Maitreya! You should cause these deva-sons to abandon their discriminating views regarding bodhi. Why is this so?

"'Bodhi cannot be attained by body and cannot be attained by mind.¹³ Quiescence is bodhi, because all characteristics are extinguished. Non-viewing is bodhi, because all conditions are abandoned. Non-action is bodhi, because there is no recollection. Cutting off is bodhi, because all views are relinquished. Separation is bodhi, because all delusive thoughts are abandoned. Obstruction is bodhi, because all aspirations are obstructed.¹⁴ Non-entry is bodhi, because there is no attachment. Accordance is bodhi, because it accords with thusness. Abiding is bodhi, because it abides in dharma-nature. Reaching is bodhi, because it reaches the true limit.¹⁵ Non-duality is bodhi, because it is apart from mind and mental objects.¹⁶ Equality is bodhi, because it equals empty space. Unconditioned is bodhi, because it is without arising, abiding, or ceasing. Knowing is bodhi, because it comprehends the mental activities of sentient beings. Non-meeting is bodhi, because all sense-bases do not meet.¹⁷ Non-uniting is bodhi, because it is apart from the residue of afflictions. No location is bodhi, because it is without form or color. Provisional name is bodhi, because names and words are empty.¹⁸ Like transformation is bodhi, because there is no grasping or rejecting. Without confusion is bodhi, because it is constantly self-quiescent. Excellent quiescence is bodhi, because its nature is pure. Non-grasping is bodhi, because it is apart from clinging. Without difference is bodhi, because all dharmas are equal. Without comparison is bodhi, because there is nothing to which it can be compared. Subtle and wonderful is bodhi, because all dharmas are difficult to know.'¹⁹

"World-Honored One! When Vimalakirti expounded this Dharma, two hundred deva-sons attained the patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas.²⁰ Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

## Prabhāvyūha Declines

The Buddha addressed the youth Prabhāvyūha:²¹ "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

Prabhāvyūha addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, as I was leaving the great city of Vaiśālī, Vimalakirti was just entering the city. I immediately bowed in greeting and asked:

"'Elder, where are you coming from?'

"He answered: 'I am coming from the bodhimaṇḍa.'²²

"I asked: 'What is the bodhimaṇḍa?'

"He answered: 'An upright mind is the bodhimaṇḍa,²³ because it is free from falsehood. Generating practice is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it accomplishes tasks. A profound mind is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it increases merit. The bodhi-mind is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it is without error. Giving is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it does not seek reward. Upholding the precepts is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it fulfills vows. Patience is the bodhimaṇḍa, because the mind is unobstructed toward all sentient beings. Vigor is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it does not slacken or retreat. Meditation is the bodhimaṇḍa, because the mind is regulated and gentle. Wisdom is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it directly perceives all dharmas. Loving-kindness is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it is equal toward all sentient beings. Compassion is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it endures weariness and suffering. Sympathetic joy is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it delights in the Dharma. Equanimity is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it cuts off aversion and affection. Supernatural powers are the bodhimaṇḍa, because they accomplish the six penetrations. Liberation is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it can turn the back [on defilements].²⁴ Skillful means is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it teaches and transforms sentient beings. The four means of attraction are the bodhimaṇḍa, because they embrace sentient beings. Extensive learning is the bodhimaṇḍa, because one practices according to what one has heard. Controlling the mind is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it correctly contemplates all dharmas.²⁵ The thirty-seven factors of enlightenment are the bodhimaṇḍa, because they abandon conditioned dharmas. The truths²⁶ are the bodhimaṇḍa, because they do not deceive the world. Dependent origination is the bodhimaṇḍa, because ignorance up to old age and death are all without exhaustion.²⁷ The afflictions are the bodhimaṇḍa, because they are known as they truly are. Sentient beings are the bodhimaṇḍa, because they are known to be without self. All dharmas are the bodhimaṇḍa, because all dharmas are known to be empty. Conquering Māra is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it is not overturned. The three realms are the bodhimaṇḍa, because there is no destination. The lion's roar is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it is fearless. The powers, fearlessnesses, and unique qualities are the bodhimaṇḍa, because they are without faults. The three insights are the bodhimaṇḍa, because they are without remaining obstructions. In one thought-moment knowing all dharmas is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it accomplishes omniscience.²⁸

"'Thus, good son! If a bodhisattva teaches and transforms sentient beings in accordance with the pāramitās, whatever he does—raising his foot or lowering his foot—you should know all comes from the bodhimaṇḍa and abides in the Buddha-Dharma.'²⁹

"When he expounded this Dharma, five hundred deva-sons and humans all generated the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

## Jagatīṃdhara Declines

The Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Jagatīṃdhara:³⁰ "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

Jagatīṃdhara addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, I was staying in my quiet chamber. At that time, Māra Pāpīyas,³¹ accompanied by twelve thousand celestial maidens, appearing like Śakra, with drums and strings and songs, came to my place. With his retinue, he bowed with his head at my feet, joined his palms reverently, and stood to one side.

"I, thinking he was Śakra, said to him: 'Welcome, Kauśika!³² Although you deserve such merit, you should not be self-indulgent. You should contemplate the impermanence of the five desires and seek the wholesome root; regarding body, life, and wealth, you should cultivate the solid Dharma.'

"He immediately said to me: 'Righteous one! Receive these twelve thousand celestial maidens to be your attendants for sweeping and sprinkling.'

"I said: 'Kauśika! Do not present such non-Dharmic things to a son of the Śākya's śramaṇa.³³ This is not appropriate for me.'

"Before I had finished speaking, Vimalakirti came and said to me: 'This is not Śakra—this is Māra, come to disturb you!'

"He immediately addressed Māra: 'These women can be given to me—I am one who should accept them.'

"Māra was immediately alarmed, thinking: 'Will Vimalakirti harm me?' He wished to hide his form and leave, but he could not hide. Exhausting all his supernatural powers, he still could not leave. Then he heard a voice from the sky saying: 'Pāpīyas! Give the women to him, and only then can you leave.'

"Māra, because of his fear, reluctantly gave them.

"At that time, Vimalakirti addressed the women: 'Māra has given you to me. Now you should all generate the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*.³⁴'

"He then expounded the Dharma to them according to their capacities, causing them to generate the aspiration for the Way. He further said: 'You have already generated the aspiration for the Way. You have Dharma-joy with which to enjoy yourselves—you should no longer take pleasure in the five desires.'³⁵

"The celestial maidens immediately asked: 'What is Dharma-joy?'

"He answered: 'Joy is constantly having faith in the Buddha. Joy is wishing to hear the Dharma. Joy is making offerings to the assembly. Joy is being apart from the five desires. Joy is viewing the five aggregates as enemies. Joy is viewing the four great elements as venomous snakes. Joy is viewing the internal sense-bases as empty villages.³⁶ Joy is following and protecting the aspiration for the Way. Joy is benefiting sentient beings. Joy is honoring and serving the teacher. Joy is extensively practicing giving. Joy is firmly upholding the precepts. Joy is patience and gentleness. Joy is diligently gathering the roots of goodness. Joy is meditative concentration without confusion. Joy is wisdom apart from defilements. Joy is widely generating the bodhi-mind. Joy is conquering the māras. Joy is cutting off the afflictions. Joy is purifying the buddha-lands. Joy is accomplishing the marks and excellent characteristics, thereby cultivating all merits. Joy is adorning the bodhimaṇḍa. Joy is hearing the profound Dharma without fear. Joy is the three gates of liberation³⁷ without delighting in inopportune times. Joy is being close to those who study the same Dharma. Joy is having no resentful obstruction in the mind toward those who do not study the same Dharma.³⁸ Joy is supporting evil friends. Joy is drawing close to good friends.³⁹ Joy is joyful purity of mind. Joy is cultivating immeasurable practice-methods of the Way. This is the Dharma-joy of bodhisattvas.'

"At that time, Pāpīyas addressed the women: 'I wish to return with you to the heavenly palace.'

"The women said: 'Since you have given us to this elder, we have Dharma-joy and are very joyful. We no longer take pleasure in the five desires.'

"Māra said: 'Elder, can you release these women? To give away all one has to others—this is the bodhisattva.'

"Vimalakirti said: 'I have already released them! You may take them. Let all sentient beings' Dharma-aspirations be fulfilled.'⁴⁰

"Thereupon the women asked Vimalakirti: 'How should we abide in Māra's palace?'

"Vimalakirti said: 'Sisters! There is a Dharma-gate called the Inexhaustible Lamp.⁴¹ You should learn it. The Inexhaustible Lamp is like a single lamp lighting a hundred thousand lamps—the dark all become bright, and the brightness is never exhausted.

"'Thus, sisters! A single bodhisattva guides and opens a hundred thousand sentient beings, causing them to generate the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*—their aspiration for the Way is also never extinguished. According to what they teach, they increase all wholesome dharmas in themselves. This is called the Inexhaustible Lamp.

"'Although you abide in Māra's palace, with this Inexhaustible Lamp, cause innumerable deva-sons and deva-daughters to generate the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. This will repay the Buddha's kindness and will also greatly benefit all sentient beings.'

"Then the celestial maidens bowed with their heads at Vimalakirti's feet and followed Māra back to the palace, suddenly disappearing.

"World-Honored One! Vimalakirti has such autonomous supernatural power and wisely eloquent speech. Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

## Sudhana Declines

The Buddha addressed the elder's son Sudhana:⁴² "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

Sudhana addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, in my father's house I held a great donation ceremony,⁴³ making offerings to all śramaṇas and brahmins, as well as various non-Buddhist teachers, the poor, the lowly, the orphaned and solitary, and beggars. After the full seven-day period, Vimalakirti came and entered the assembly. He said to me:

"'Son of an elder! A great donation ceremony should not be held as you are holding it. You should hold a Dharma-giving ceremony.⁴⁴ What is the use of a wealth-giving ceremony?'

"I said: 'Elder! What is a Dharma-giving ceremony?'

"He answered: 'A Dharma-giving ceremony is one in which, without before or after, one simultaneously makes offerings to all sentient beings.⁴⁵ This is called a Dharma-giving ceremony.'

"I said: 'What does this mean?'

"'It means: Using bodhi to arouse the mind of loving-kindness.⁴⁶ Using saving sentient beings to arouse the mind of great compassion. Using upholding the true Dharma to arouse the mind of sympathetic joy. Using gathering wisdom to practice equanimity. Using gathering up stinginess and greed to arouse the pāramitā of giving. Using transforming those who violate the precepts to arouse the pāramitā of morality. Using the teaching of non-self to arouse the pāramitā of patience. Using departing from the characteristics of body and mind to arouse the pāramitā of vigor. Using the characteristic of bodhi to arouse the pāramitā of meditation. Using omniscience to arouse the pāramitā of wisdom.

"'Teaching and transforming sentient beings, yet arising emptiness. Not abandoning conditioned dharmas, yet arising signlessness. Manifesting being born, yet arising wishlessness. Protecting and upholding the true Dharma, arising the power of skillful means. Using liberating sentient beings to arise the four means of attraction. Using honoring all beings to arise the elimination of pride. Regarding body, life, and wealth, arising the three solid dharmas.⁴⁷ In the six recollections, arising the method of thought.⁴⁸ In the six harmonies and reverence, arising straightforward mind.⁴⁹ Correctly practicing wholesome dharmas, arising pure livelihood. With a pure and joyful mind, arising closeness to noble sages. Without hating evil people, arising a regulated mind. With the dharma of leaving home, arising a profound mind. With practicing as one says, arising extensive learning. With the teaching of non-contention, arising solitude. Tending toward the Buddha's wisdom, arising seated meditation. Liberating the bonds of sentient beings, arising stages of practice. With accomplishing the marks and excellent characteristics, and purifying the buddha-lands, arising meritorious karma. Knowing all sentient beings' thoughts and teaching the Dharma accordingly, arising knowledge-karma. Knowing all dharmas without grasping or rejecting and entering the single-characteristic gate, arising wisdom-karma.⁵⁰ Cutting off all afflictions, all obstacles, and all unwholesome dharmas, arising all wholesome karma. Attaining all wisdom and all wholesome dharmas, arising all practices that assist the Buddha-Way.

"'Thus, good son! This is a Dharma-giving ceremony. If a bodhisattva abides in this Dharma-giving ceremony, he is a great donor and also a field of merit for all the world.'⁵¹

"World-Honored One! When Vimalakirti expounded this Dharma, among the brahmin assembly, two hundred people all generated the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. At that time, my mind attained purity. I sighed at the unprecedented experience! I bowed with my head at Vimalakirti's feet and immediately removed my necklace worth a hundred thousand [coins] to offer him, but he refused to accept it.

"I said: 'Elder! Please accept it and give it as you wish.'

"Vimalakirti then accepted the necklace and divided it into two parts. He gave one part to the lowest beggar in the assembly and offered one part to the Tathāgata Duṣprasaha.⁵² The entire assembly saw the Radiant Land of the Tathāgata Duṣprasaha, and they also saw the pearl necklace on that buddha transforming into a four-pillared jeweled platform, magnificently adorned on all four sides without obstructing one another.

"When Vimalakirti had manifested this spiritual transformation, he said: 'If a donor gives with an equal mind to the lowest beggar, this is the same as the field of merit of the Tathāgata—without any discrimination, equal in great compassion, not seeking any reward. This is called the complete Dharma-giving.'⁵³

"When the lowest beggar in the city saw this spiritual power and heard his words, all generated the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

## Conclusion

Thus did all the bodhisattvas each explain to the Buddha the account of their own past encounter, describing what Vimalakirti had said, and all declared they were not capable of going to inquire about his illness.

### Footnotes

¹ **[Textual]** Maitreya (彌勒, *Maitreya*). The future buddha, currently a bodhisattva awaiting birth. His teaching was on the stage of non-retrogression, making him the natural first choice among bodhisattvas.

² **[Philosophical]** Stage of non-retrogression (不退轉地, *avaivartika-bhūmi*). The stage from which a bodhisattva cannot fall back. Vimalakirti challenges the very concept of prediction and attainment.

³ **[Philosophical]** One-lifetime prediction. The prophecy that in Maitreya's next life he will become a buddha. This is his defining characteristic.

⁴ **[Philosophical]** Present does not abide (現在生無住). The present moment is too fleeting to ground any prediction—it is already gone before it can be grasped.

⁵ **[Philosophical]** In this moment also being born, aging, dying. A quote from the Buddha, emphasizing radical momentariness—birth, aging, and death all occur in each instant.

⁶ **[Philosophical]** Non-arising (無生, *anutpāda*). The realization that phenomena do not truly arise.

⁷ **[Philosophical]** Ultimate position (正位). The state beyond arising and ceasing; but if there, where is prediction?

⁸ **[Philosophical]** Thusness arising/ceasing (如生如滅). Thusness (*tathatā*) neither arises nor ceases—so prediction cannot be based on it.

⁹ **[Philosophical]** All sentient beings are thusness. Since everything is thusness, and thusness is non-dual, if Maitreya is predicted, all are predicted.

¹⁰ **[Philosophical]** Non-dual and non-different (不二不異). The heart of the Vimalakirti Sutra's teaching.

¹¹ **[Philosophical]** All sentient beings are the characteristic of bodhi. **KEY DOCTRINE**: Enlightenment is not something added to beings—it is their very nature.

¹² **[Philosophical]** No further extinction to undergo. Beings are already in nirvāṇa in their ultimate nature—there is no second extinction.

¹³ **[Philosophical]** Cannot be attained by body or mind. Bodhi transcends psychophysical existence.

¹⁴ **[Philosophical]** Obstruction is bodhi. A paradox: bodhi obstructs all goals because there is nothing to achieve.

¹⁵ **[Philosophical]** True limit (實際, *bhūta-koṭi*). The absolute boundary of reality.

¹⁶ **[Philosophical]** Apart from mind and mental objects (離意法). Beyond subject-object duality.

¹⁷ **[Philosophical]** Sense-bases do not meet. The ordinary model of cognition (sense meeting object) is deconstructed.

¹⁸ **[Philosophical]** Provisional name. **KEY THEME**: "Bodhi" is just a word—names have no inherent reality.

¹⁹ **[Philosophical]** All dharmas are difficult to know. This conclusion emphasizes the ineffability of awakening.

²⁰ **[Philosophical]** Patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas. A very high attainment resulting from this teaching.

²¹ **[Textual]** Prabhāvyūha (光嚴童子, *Prabhāvyūha*). "Splendid Light Youth." A bodhisattva.

²² **[Philosophical]** Bodhimaṇḍa (道場). Literally "place of enlightenment"—the spot where a buddha attains awakening. Vimalakirti radically redefines it.

²³ **[Philosophical]** **KEY TEACHING**: Every quality is the bodhimaṇḍa. This extensive list transforms the bodhimaṇḍa from a physical location to the entire field of spiritual practice.

²⁴ **[Philosophical]** Can turn the back. Liberation enables one to turn away from defilements.

²⁵ **[Philosophical]** Controlling the mind. The foundational practice.

²⁶ **[Textual]** The truths (諦). The Four Noble Truths.

²⁷ **[Philosophical]** Without exhaustion. Even the twelve links of dependent origination are understood non-dually—they neither terminate nor are they eternal.

²⁸ **[Philosophical]** Omniscience (一切智, *sarvajñatā*). The knowing that encompasses all dharmas in a single moment.

²⁹ **[Philosophical]** **REVOLUTIONARY TEACHING**: Every action comes from the bodhimaṇḍa. The awakening-place is not somewhere else—it is here, in every step.

³⁰ **[Textual]** Jagatīṃdhara (持世, *Jagatīṃdhara*). "Upholder of the World." A bodhisattva.

³¹ **[Textual]** Māra Pāpīyas (魔波旬). The evil one, the tempter.

³² **[Textual]** Kauśika (憍尸迦). A name for Śakra/Indra.

³³ **[Textual]** Śākya's śramaṇa. A Buddhist monk, follower of the Śākyan sage.

³⁴ **[Philosophical]** Vimalakirti teaches even Māra's women. This radical inclusivity shows the reach of skillful means.

³⁵ **[Philosophical]** Dharma-joy vs. five desires. Spiritual happiness replaces sensual pleasure.

³⁶ **[Philosophical]** Five aggregates as enemies, four elements as snakes, sense-bases as empty villages. Classic analogies for disenchantment with the body and world.

³⁷ **[Philosophical]** Three gates of liberation. Emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness.

³⁸ **[Philosophical]** No resentful obstruction toward those who do not study. Non-sectarianism.

³⁹ **[Philosophical]** Supporting evil friends, drawing close to good friends. The apparent contradiction resolves: one supports all beings while being influenced by the good.

⁴⁰ **[Philosophical]** Let all beings' Dharma-aspirations be fulfilled. Vimalakirti's giving is this ultimate wish.

⁴¹ **[Philosophical]** **KEY TEACHING: Inexhaustible Lamp (無盡燈)**. One lamp lighting countless others—one teacher awakening countless beings. This becomes a model for the bodhisattva's work.

⁴² **[Textual]** Sudhana (善德). "Good Virtue." A layman; not the same as the famous Sudhana of the Gaṇḍavyūha.

⁴³ **[Textual]** Great donation ceremony (大施會). A traditional lavish giving ceremony.

⁴⁴ **[Philosophical]** Dharma-giving (法施). Superior to material giving, because it gives the means for liberation.

⁴⁵ **[Philosophical]** Without before or after, simultaneously. Non-dual giving transcends temporal sequence.

⁴⁶ **[Philosophical]** Using bodhi to arouse loving-kindness. The entire list that follows shows how each practice is grounded in awakening.

⁴⁷ **[Philosophical]** Three solid dharmas. Giving body, life, and wealth.

⁴⁸ **[Textual]** Six recollections (六念). Recollection of Buddha, Dharma, Saṅgha, giving, morality, and the devas.

⁴⁹ **[Textual]** Six harmonies and reverence (六和敬). Harmony in body, speech, mind, morality, views, and property.

⁵⁰ **[Philosophical]** Single-characteristic gate (一相門). The gate of non-duality.

⁵¹ **[Philosophical]** Field of merit for all the world (一切世間福田). The bodhisattva who practices Dharma-giving is the supreme recipient of offerings.

⁵² **[Textual]** Tathāgata Duṣprasaha (難勝如來). "The Hard-to-Surpass Tathāgata." A buddha of another world-system.

⁵³ **[Philosophical]** **KEY TEACHING**: Equal giving to the lowest beggar equals giving to a buddha. This democratizes merit and eliminates hierarchy in generosity.

### Key Concepts

**Deconstruction of Prediction and Attainment**: Maitreya's encounter shows that even the most exalted Buddhist concepts—like receiving prediction from a buddha—are empty of inherent existence. There is no moment in which prediction occurs, no real distinction between Maitreya and all beings.

**The Bodhimaṇḍa Redefined**: Prabhāvyūha's encounter transforms the "place of enlightenment" from the Bodh Gaya site into every practice, every quality, every moment. Enlightenment is not somewhere else.

**The Inexhaustible Lamp**: This teaching to Māra's women is one of the sutra's most famous passages. Liberation is not diminished by being shared—it increases. Each awakened being ignites others.

**Dharma-Giving vs. Wealth-Giving**: Sudhana's encounter contrasts external generosity with the deeper gift of liberation. True giving crosses all barriers simultaneously.
