## Indra's Pledge

At that time, Śakra Devanāma Indra (King of Gods) spoke to the Buddha from within the great assembly: "World Honored One! Although I have heard hundreds of thousands of sutras from the Buddha and Mañjuśrī, I have never heard this inconceivable scripture of sovereign supernatural power and decisive reality.
"As I understand the meaning of what the Buddha has said, if there are sentient beings who hear this Sutra-Dharma, believe and understand it, receive and hold it, and read and recite it, they will surely obtain this Dharma without doubt. How much more so if they cultivate according to the teaching?
"Such a person closes the gates to all evil destinies and opens the gates to all good deeds. He is constantly protected and kept in mind by all Buddhas. He subdues heterodox teachings, destroys the enemies of Māra, cultivates Bodhi, sits peacefully in the Way-place (*bodhimaṇḍa*), and treads the path walked by the Tathāgata.
"World Honored One! If there are those who receive, hold, read, recite, and cultivate according to the teaching, I and my relatives will make offerings and serve them. Wherever this Sutra is located—whether in villages, cities, mountains, forests, or wilderness—I and my relatives will go to that place to listen to and receive the Dharma. I will cause those who do not yet believe to generate faith, and those who already believe, I will protect."

The Buddha said: "Excellent, excellent! Heavenly Emperor! It is as you say. I rejoice with you. This Sutra expounds the inconceivable *Anuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi* of the Buddhas of the past, future, and present. Therefore, Heavenly Emperor! If a good man or good woman receives, holds, reads, recites, and makes offerings to this Sutra, they are making offerings to the Buddhas of the past, future, and present.

"Heavenly Emperor! Suppose the Three Thousand Great Thousand World were filled with Tathāgatas, dense like sugarcane, bamboo, reeds, hemp, or forests. If a good man or good woman were to revere, honor, praise, and make offerings to them for a kalpa or less than a kalpa; and after those Buddhas entered extinction (*parinirvāṇa*), they erected seven-jeweled stupas for each one's full-body relics—stupas as wide as the Four Continents and as high as the Brahma Heaven, adorned with banners—and made offerings of flowers, incense, garlands, banners, and music for a kalpa or less than a kalpa.
"What do you think, Heavenly Emperor? Is the merit planted by this person great or not?"

Śakra Devanāma Indra said: "It is great, World Honored One! The merit of that person cannot be exhausted even if one spoke for hundreds of thousands of millions of kalpas."

The Buddha told the Heavenly Emperor: "You should know that if a good man or good woman hears this Inconceivable Liberation Scripture, believes, understands, receives, holds, reads, recites, and practices it, their merit is even greater than that.
"Why? Because the Bodhi of all Buddhas arises from this. The characteristic of Bodhi is immeasurable; therefore, the merit from this cause is also immeasurable."

## The Story of Medicine King and the Dharma Offering

The Buddha told the Heavenly Emperor: "In the past, countless Asamkhyeya kalpas ago, there was a Buddha named **Medicine King Tathāgata** (*Bhaiṣajyarāja*), Worthy of Offerings, Perfectly Enlightened...¹ His world was called Great Adornment (*Mahāvyūha*), and the kalpa was called Adornment. That Buddha's lifespan was twenty small kalpas.
"At that time, there was a Wheel-Turning Sage King (*Cakravartin*) named **Precious Canons** (*Ratnacchattra*), who possessed the seven jewels and ruled the Four Continents. The King had one thousand sons, upright and brave, capable of subduing enemies.

"At that time, Precious Canons and his relatives made offerings to Medicine King Tathāgata for five full kalpas. After five kalpas, he told his thousand sons: 'You should also, like me, make offerings to the Buddha with a deep mind.'
"The thousand sons obeyed their father's command and made offerings to Medicine King Tathāgata for another five full kalpas.
"One of the King's sons, named **Moon Canopy** (*Candracchattra*), sat alone and thought: 'Is there any offering that surpasses this?'
"By the Buddha's spiritual power, a deity in the sky said: 'Good man! The **Offering of Dharma** (*Dharma-pūjā*) surpasses all offerings.'
"He immediately asked: 'What is meant by the Offering of Dharma?'
"The deity said: 'You can go ask Medicine King Tathāgata; he will explain the Offering of Dharma to you in detail.'

"Prince Moon Canopy immediately went to Medicine King Tathāgata, bowed at his feet, stood to one side, and asked: 'World Honored One! Among all offerings, the Offering of Dharma is supreme. What is the Offering of Dharma?'

"The Buddha said: 'Good man! The Offering of Dharma is:
"Those profound sutras spoken by the Buddhas—difficult for the world to believe and accept, subtle and difficult to see, pure and undefiled, not obtainable merely by discriminative thinking.
"They are contained in the Bodhisattva's Dharma-Treasury and sealed by the Dhāraṇī-seal.
"They lead to the non-retrogressive stage, accomplish the Six Pāramitās, skillfully distinguish meanings, and accord with the Bodhi-Dharma.
"They are supreme among all sutras. They enter Great Compassion and Compassion, separating from all demonic affairs and deviant views.
"They accord with the law of causes and conditions (*pratītyasamutpāda*): no self, no person, no sentient being, no lifespan; empty, signless, wishless, and unarisen.
"They enable sentient beings to sit in the Way-place and turn the Dharma-wheel.
"They are praised by heavenly beings, dragons, spirits, and Gandharvas.
"They enable sentient beings to enter the Buddha's Dharma-Treasury and gather all the wisdom of the sages.
"They explain the path practiced by all Bodhisattvas.
"Relying on the meaning of the True Characteristic of all dharmas, they clearly proclaim the dharmas of impermanence, suffering, emptiness, no-self, and tranquil extinction.
"They can save all sentient beings who have broken the precepts; they can cause fear in all demons, heretics, and greedy attached ones.
"They are praised by all Buddhas and sages. They turn away from the suffering of birth-and-death and demonstrate the joy of Nirvana.
"They are spoken by the Buddhas of the ten directions and three times.

"If one hears sutras like these, believes, understands, receives, holds, reads, recites, and uses skillful means to explain and distinguish them clearly for sentient beings—guarding and protecting the Dharma—this is called the **Offering of Dharma**.

"Furthermore, practicing according to the teaching with regard to all dharmas, according with the Twelve Links of Origination, separating from deviant views, obtaining the Patience of Non-Arising (*anutpattika-dharma-kṣānti*), determining there is no self and no sentient being, yet having no contradiction or dispute regarding cause and effect...
"Relying on the **Meaning**, not the Word.
"Relying on **Wisdom**, not Consciousness.
"Relying on Sutras of **Definitive Meaning** (*nītārtha*), not Sutras of Provisional Meaning (*neyārtha*).
"Relying on the **Dharma**, not the Person.²
"According with the Dharma-characteristic (*dharmalakṣaṇa*), with no entry and no return. Because ignorance is ultimately extinguished, all formations are ultimately extinguished... up to birth being extinguished, old age and death are ultimately extinguished. Performing this observation of the Twelve Links: there is no characteristic of exhaustion, nor any arising of views. This is called the supreme Offering of Dharma.'"

## The Prophecy

The Buddha told the Heavenly Emperor: "Prince Moon Canopy heard this Dharma from Medicine King Buddha and obtained the Soft and Compliant Patience (*anulomikā-kṣānti*). He immediately took off his precious robes and ornaments to offer to the Buddha, saying: 'World Honored One! After the Tathāgata's extinction, I will perform the Dharma Offering and protect the True Dharma. May your majestic spirit support me to establish this, enabling me to subdue demon enemies and cultivate the Bodhisattva practice.'
"The Buddha knew his deep thought and prophesied: 'In the final age, you will protect the City of Dharma.'

"Heavenly Emperor! At that time, Prince Moon Canopy saw the purity of the Dharma and heard the Buddha's prophecy. With faith, he left the household life (*pravrajyā*) and cultivated the good roots. Before long, he obtained the Five Supernatural Powers, attained the Bodhisattva Way, and obtained Dhāraṇī and unobstructed eloquence.
"After that Buddha's extinction, using his powers of supernatural penetration, total recall (*dhāraṇī*), and eloquence, he distributed the Dharma-wheel turned by Medicine King Tathāgata for ten small kalpas.
"Monk Moon Canopy, by protecting the Dharma and practicing diligently, caused one million billion people to stand irreversibly in *Anuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi* in that very body; fourteen nayutas of people generated the minds of Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas; and immeasurable sentient beings were born in the heavens.

"Heavenly Emperor! Was that King Precious Canons a different person? He is now the Buddha **Precious Flame** (*Ratnārcis*). His thousand sons are the thousand Buddhas of this Virtuous Kalpa (*Bhadrakalpa*)—starting from Krakucchanda Buddha and ending with Rucika Buddha.
"And make no mistake: **Monk Moon Canopy was I, myself.**

"Thus, Heavenly Emperor! You should know this essential point: The Offering of Dharma is supreme, greatest, and incomparable among all offerings. Therefore, Heavenly Emperor! You should make offerings to the Buddha by means of the Offering of Dharma."

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Footnotes

1.  **Medicine King Tathāgata**: *Bhaiṣajyarāja*. Not to be confused with the Medicine Buddha (*Bhaiṣajyaguru*) famous in East Asia. This is a past Buddha under whom Śākyamuni practiced.
2.  **The Four Reliances** (*Catuḥpratisaraṇa*): A critical hermeneutical tool in Buddhism introduced here.
    *   Rely on the **Dharma**, not the **Teacher** (*dharma-pratisaraṇa*).
    *   Rely on the **Meaning**, not the **Letter** (*artha-pratisaraṇa*).
    *   Rely on the **Definitive Meaning**, not the **Provisional Meaning** (*nītārtha-pratisaraṇa*).
    *   Rely on **Wisdom**, not **Consciousness** (*jñāna-pratisaraṇa*).

### Concepts

*   **Dharma Offering (Dharma-pūjā)**: The central argument of this chapter. Material offerings (*āmiṣa-pūjā*)—flowers, stupas, money—yield finite merit because the objects are finite. Offering the Dharma (by teaching it or practicing it) yields infinite merit because the Dharma is infinite (unconditioned).
*   **Protection of Dharma**: The truest protection is not building walls around scriptures, but embodying their meaning ("practicing according to the teaching").
