## Śāriputra's Dilemma

At that time, Śāriputra saw that there were no seats in the chamber and thought: "Where will all these bodhisattvas and great disciples sit?"

The elder Vimalakīrti, knowing his thought, said to Śāriputra: "What is it, venerable one? Have you come for the Dharma, or have you come seeking a seat?"

Śāriputra replied: "I have come for the Dharma, not for a seat."

## The True Seeker of Dharma

Vimalakīrti said: "Śāriputra! One who truly seeks the Dharma does not covet even their own body and life—how much less a seat! One who seeks the Dharma does not seek through form, sensation, perception, mental formations, or consciousness. One who seeks the Dharma does not seek through the realms, sense-bases, or the realms of desire, form, and formlessness.

"Śāriputra! One who seeks the Dharma is not attached to seeking the Buddha, not attached to seeking the Dharma, not attached to seeking the Sangha. One who seeks the Dharma does not seek by seeing suffering, does not seek by cutting off the origin, does not seek by realizing cessation or cultivating the path. Why is this?

"The Dharma is free from idle speculation (*prapañca*). If one says 'I will see suffering, cut off the origin, realize cessation, and cultivate the path'—this is idle speculation, not seeking the Dharma.

"Śāriputra! The Dharma is called 'quiescence.' If one practices arising and ceasing, one seeks arising and ceasing, not the Dharma. The Dharma is called 'undefiled.' If one is attached to dharmas, even up to nirvāṇa, this is defilement, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma has no place of practice. If one practices in the dharmas, this is a place of practice, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma has no grasping or rejecting. If one grasps or rejects dharmas, this is grasping and rejecting, not seeking the Dharma.

"The Dharma has no location. If one is attached to location, this is attachment to location, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma is called 'signless.' If one follows signs and cognizes, this is seeking signs, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma cannot be abided in. If one abides in the Dharma, this is abiding in dharmas, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma cannot be seen, heard, sensed, or known. If one practices seeing, hearing, sensing, and knowing, this is seeing, hearing, sensing, and knowing—not seeking the Dharma.

"The Dharma is called 'unconditioned.' If one practices the conditioned, this is seeking the conditioned, not seeking the Dharma. Therefore, Śāriputra! One who seeks the Dharma should have nothing to seek in regard to any dharma."[^1]

When these words were spoken, five hundred gods attained the purity of the Dharma-eye regarding all dharmas.

[^1]: This passage represents the apex of apophatic (*via negativa*) Mahāyāna teaching—the Dharma cannot be approached through any conventional means, including the Four Noble Truths themselves when grasped as substantial realities.

## The Thirty-Two Thousand Lion Thrones

At that time, the elder Vimalakīrti asked Manjuśrī: "Venerable one! You have traveled through countless billions of immeasurable *asaṃkhyeya* worlds—which buddha-land has lion thrones of supreme and wondrous merit?"

Manjuśrī replied: "Householder! To the east, past thirty-six times the sands of the Ganges River worlds, there is a realm called Sumeru-Mark. Its buddha is named Sumeru Lamp King, and he is presently there. That buddha's body is 84,000 *yojanas* tall. His lion throne is 84,000 *yojanas* high, supremely adorned."[^2]

Thereupon, the elder Vimalakīrti displayed his supernatural power, and immediately that buddha sent 32,000 lion thrones—lofty, vast, and magnificently pure—which entered Vimalakīrti's chamber. All the bodhisattvas, great disciples, Śakra, Brahmā, and the Four Heavenly Kings had never seen such a thing before.

The chamber was broad and vast, completely containing all 32,000 lion thrones with no obstruction whatsoever. In the city of Vaiśālī and in Jambudvīpa and the four continents, there was also no crowding—everything appeared as before.

[^2]: A *yojana* is an ancient Indian measure of distance, approximately 7-9 miles. A throne 84,000 yojanas high would extend from earth far beyond the atmosphere—an image emphasizing the inconceivable nature of this liberation.

## Those Who Cannot Ascend

Then Vimalakīrti said to Manjuśrī: "Please take a lion throne! Together with all the bodhisattvas and superior beings, sit down—but you must transform your bodies to match the size of the thrones."

Those bodhisattvas who had attained supernatural powers immediately transformed themselves to be 42,000 *yojanas* tall and sat on the lion thrones. But the newly-initiated bodhisattvas and the great disciples were unable to ascend.

Then Vimalakīrti said to Śāriputra: "Please take a lion throne!"

Śāriputra replied: "Householder! These thrones are so lofty and vast that I cannot ascend. How can I sit?"

Vimalakīrti said: "Śāriputra! You must pay homage to Sumeru Lamp King Tathāgata, and then you will be able to sit."

Thereupon, the newly-initiated bodhisattvas and the great disciples paid homage to Sumeru Lamp King Tathāgata, and they were able to sit on the lion thrones.

## The Small Room That Contains Everything

Śāriputra exclaimed: "Householder! This is unprecedented! Such a small room contains these lofty and vast thrones, and there is no obstruction in the city of Vaiśālī. And in Jambudvīpa—in its villages and cities—and in all the four continents, in the palaces of the gods, dragon kings, and spirits, there is also no crowding!"

## The Inconceivable Liberation Explained

Vimalakīrti said: "Śāriputra! The buddhas and bodhisattvas have a liberation called 'the Inconceivable.' If a bodhisattva abides in this liberation, they can place the height and breadth of Mount Sumeru inside a mustard seed without either increasing or decreasing—Mount Sumeru, King of Mountains, remains as before in its original form, and the Four Heavenly Kings and the gods of Trāyastriṃśa neither perceive nor know that they have entered. Only those who are to be liberated see Mount Sumeru enter the mustard seed. This is called 'abiding in the gateway of inconceivable liberation.'

"Furthermore, they can place the waters of the four great oceans into a single hair-pore without disturbing the fish, turtles, tortoises, crocodiles, and other water creatures—and the great oceans remain in their original form. The dragons, spirits, and asuras neither perceive nor know that they have entered, and these beings are not disturbed in the slightest.

"Furthermore, Śāriputra! A bodhisattva abiding in inconceivable liberation can take the great trichiliocosm, like a potter's wheel, and place it in the palm of their right hand, and cast it past worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, yet the beings within neither perceive nor know where they are going. And it can be returned to its original place, with no being having any notion of coming or going, and the world remains in its original form.

"Furthermore, Śāriputra! If there are beings who delight in long lives and can thereby be liberated, the bodhisattva extends seven days to become one *kalpa*, causing those beings to perceive it as one kalpa. If there are beings who do not delight in long lives and can thereby be liberated, the bodhisattva compresses one kalpa into seven days, causing those beings to perceive it as seven days.

"Furthermore, Śāriputra! A bodhisattva abiding in inconceivable liberation gathers the adornments of all buddha-lands into a single land and displays them to beings. And a bodhisattva can place the beings of one buddha-land in the palm of their right hand and fly throughout the ten directions, showing them everything, without moving from their original place.

"Furthermore, Śāriputra! The offerings made by beings of the ten directions to all buddhas—a bodhisattva can make them all visible in a single hair-pore. And all the suns, moons, and stars of the lands of the ten directions can be made universally visible in a single hair-pore.

"Furthermore, Śāriputra! All the winds of the worlds of the ten directions—a bodhisattva can suck them all into their mouth without harming their body, and the trees outside are not damaged. And when the *kalpas* of the ten directions end in conflagration, the bodhisattva can take all the fires into their belly—the fires function as before, without causing harm.

"Furthermore, taking one buddha-land from below, past worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, and raising it upward, past countless worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges—like lifting a leaf on a needle point—without disturbance.

"Furthermore, Śāriputra! A bodhisattva abiding in inconceivable liberation can manifest through supernatural powers a buddha-body, or a pratyekabuddha-body, or a śrāvaka-body, or a Śakra-body, or a Brahma-body, or a world-lord-body, or a wheel-turning-king-body.

"Furthermore, all the sounds of the worlds of the ten directions—high, medium, and low—can all be transformed into the Buddha's voice, proclaiming the sounds of impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and non-self, as well as the various teachings spoken by all the buddhas of the ten directions, causing all within to hear them.

"Śāriputra! I have now given a brief account of the power of the bodhisattva's inconceivable liberation. If I were to speak of it extensively, I could not exhaust it in an entire *kalpa*."[^3]

[^3]: This inventory of "inconceivable" powers illustrates the Mahāyāna teaching that space, time, and causality are conventional appearances (*saṃvṛti*) rather than ultimate realities. The liberated mind operates beyond these constraints.

## Mahākāśyapa's Lament

At this time, Mahākāśyapa heard the teaching of the bodhisattva's inconceivable liberation gateway and sighed in wonder. He said to Śāriputra:

"It is like displaying various colored forms before a blind person—they cannot see them. Just so, when all the śrāvakas hear this gateway of inconceivable liberation, they cannot understand it! When the wise hear this, who among them would not arouse the aspiration for *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*?

"Why have we forever cut off our roots? Regarding this Great Vehicle, we are already like scorched seeds![^4] All the śrāvakas, hearing this gateway of inconceivable liberation, should weep with voices that shake the great trichiliocosm! All the bodhisattvas should rejoice greatly and receive this teaching upon their heads with reverence.

"If there are bodhisattvas who believe in and understand this gateway of inconceivable liberation, all the hosts of Māra can do nothing to them."

When Mahākāśyapa spoke these words, 32,000 gods all aroused the aspiration for *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*.

[^4]: "Scorched seeds" (*dagdha-bīja*) is the famous metaphor for arhats who, having eradicated the defilements, have also eliminated the capacity for bodhisattva awakening. This self-deprecation reflects the sutra's critique of the śrāvaka path as incomplete.

## The Māras Are Bodhisattvas

Then Vimalakīrti said to Mahākāśyapa: "Venerable one! In the countless immeasurable *asaṃkhyeya* worlds of the ten directions, those who act as māra-kings are mostly bodhisattvas abiding in inconceivable liberation. Through the power of skillful means, they teach beings by appearing as māra-kings.

"Furthermore, Kāśyapa! Among the countless bodhisattvas of the ten directions, sometimes there are people who come begging for hands, feet, ears, nose, head, eyes, marrow, brain, blood, flesh, skin, bone, villages, cities, wives, children, servants, elephants, horses, carriages, gold, silver, lapis lazuli, crystal, agate, coral, amber, pearls, shells, clothing, and food. Such beggars are mostly bodhisattvas abiding in inconceivable liberation who, through the power of skillful means, come to test them and make them firm.

"Why is this? Bodhisattvas abiding in inconceivable liberation have the power of awesome virtue, and thus they manifest oppressive demands to show beings what is difficult. Ordinary beings who are inferior have no power or force—they cannot oppress bodhisattvas in this way. It is like the trampling of a dragon-elephant, which a donkey cannot endure.

"This is called the gateway of wisdom and skillful means of bodhisattvas abiding in inconceivable liberation."

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Key Philosophical Concepts

1. **Apophatic Dharma-Seeking**: Vimalakīrti's teaching that the true seeker has "nothing to seek" represents the consummate application of *śūnyatā* (emptiness) to spiritual practice itself.

2. **The Inconceivable (*acintya*)**: This term encompasses powers that transcend conventional causality—not magic in the vulgar sense, but the natural expression of a mind liberated from reified distinctions of space, time, and size.

3. **Scorched Seeds**: Mahākāśyapa's self-critique articulates the sutra's position that the arhat's liberation, while genuine, forecloses the greater possibility of universal salvation.

4. **Māra as Bodhisattva**: The revelation that demon kings are actually bodhisattvas teaching through adversity extends the non-dual logic to its radical conclusion—even evil serves awakening.

### Cross-References

- The lion throne imagery connects to the Buddha's "lion's roar" (*siṃhanāda*) tradition
- Mount Sumeru in a mustard seed appears in the Avataṃsaka Sūtra's Dharmadhātu imagery
- The extension/compression of time parallels Einstein's relativity—a point noted by D.T. Suzuki
