# Chapter 6: The Things You Can't Explain (不思議品)

**Blues Translation by Master John Kim**

## Where We Gonna Sit?

Now Shariputra looked around that bare room and thought: "All these folks came to visit—where they supposed to sit?"

Vimalakirti read his mind. "Shariputra,¹ you here for the teaching or you here for a chair?"

"I came for the Dharma, not a seat."

"That's right!² Someone who really seeks the truth don't crave body or life, let alone somewhere to sit. A true seeker don't look for it in form or feeling or thinking or doing or knowing.³ Don't look for it in the realms of desire or form or formlessness.

"Someone seeking truth ain't attached to finding Buddha.⁴ Ain't attached to finding Dharma. Ain't attached to finding the community. Someone seeking truth don't see suffering to see. Don't cut off the cause to cut off.⁵ Don't realize the end. Don't cultivate the path. Why? Because the Dharma is beyond all that talk.⁶

"You say, 'I'm gonna see suffering, cut the cause, realize cessation, walk the path'? That's just talk. That ain't finding the truth.

"The Dharma is extinction.⁷ If you're practicing birth and death, you're seeking birth and death—not the Dharma.

"The Dharma is unstained.⁸ If you get stained by it—even stained by nirvana—you're missing it.

"The Dharma has no place to act.⁹ If you make it your place, you've lost it.

"The Dharma don't take or leave.¹⁰ If you're taking and leaving, that ain't the Dharma.

"The Dharma has no location.¹¹ If you park yourself somewhere, you missed it.

"The Dharma has no sign.¹² If you're chasing signs, you're chasing the wrong thing.

"The Dharma can't be lived in.¹³ If you're dwelling there, you ain't there.

"The Dharma can't be seen, heard, felt, or known.¹⁴ If you're seeing and hearing and feeling and knowing, that's just seeing and hearing and feeling and knowing—not the Dharma.

"The Dharma is unconditioned.¹⁵ If you practice the conditioned, you're seeking the conditioned.

"Shariputra! Someone who seeks the Dharma should seek nothing at all in any dharma."¹⁶

When he said that, five hundred heavenly beings woke up to the truth.¹⁷

## The Lion Seats from Far Away

Then Vimalakirti turned to Manjushri. "In all your travels through endless worlds—which Buddha-land has the finest lion throne?"¹⁸

Manjushri said, "Way past east—past thirty-six Ganges-worth of worlds—there's a place called Sumeru-Form.¹⁹ The Buddha there is Sumeru-Lamp-King, and he's eighty-four thousand yojanas tall. His throne is just as high, decorated like nothing you ever seen."²⁰

Right then, Vimalakirti worked his power.²¹ And from that distant land, thirty-two thousand lion seats—massive, pure, beautiful—came flying into that little room. Gods and bodhisattvas had never seen anything like it.²²

The room held all of them. No crowding.²³ The city of Vaishali wasn't squeezed. The whole continent wasn't squeezed. Everything looked the same as before—except now there were thirty-two thousand giant thrones in a ten-foot room.²⁴

---

## Some Could Sit, Some Couldn't

Vimalakirti said, "Manjushri, you and the bodhisattvas—take your seats. Just make yourselves big enough to match."²⁵

The bodhisattvas with powers made themselves forty-two thousand yojanas tall and sat down easy.²⁶ But the newbies and the old monks couldn't climb up.

Vimalakirti looked at Shariputra. "Sit down!"

Shariputra said, "Man, this seat is too high. I can't get up there."²⁷

"Bow to Sumeru-Lamp-King Buddha. Then you'll make it."²⁸

So all the new bodhisattvas and disciples bowed to that distant Buddha—and suddenly they could sit just fine.

## You Want Inconceivable? Here It Is.

Shariputra's eyes were wide. "This is impossible!²⁹ This tiny room holding these giant seats! The city's not pushed aside. The world's not pressed. How?"

Vimalakirti smiled. "Shariputra, there's a liberation called the Inconceivable.³⁰ When a bodhisattva lives in that liberation, here's what he can do:

"He takes Mount Sumeru—tallest mountain in the universe—and puts it inside a mustard seed.³¹ Sumeru stays the same size. The seed stays the same size. The gods living on Sumeru don't even notice they moved.³² Only those ready to be freed can see it happen.

"He takes all four oceans and puts them in a single pore on his skin.³³ Fish, turtles, dragons—none of them get bothered. The oceans stay as they always were.

"He picks up the whole universe like a clay disc on a potter's wheel and holds it in his palm.³⁴ He throws it past countless worlds, and nobody inside feels a thing.³⁵ Then he puts it back. Nobody remembers traveling.

"He stretches seven days into a whole cosmic age—for beings who need long lives.³⁶ He compresses an age into seven days—for beings who don't need long lives.³⁷

"He gathers the glory of every Buddha-land into one place and shows it to everyone.³⁸ He takes whole populations in his palm and flies through ten directions, showing them everything—and never leaves his spot.³⁹

"He makes visible in one pore all the offerings people make to Buddhas everywhere.⁴⁰ All the suns and moons and stars in the universe—visible in one pore.

"He breathes in all the winds of every world.⁴¹ Body's not harmed. Trees outside don't break.

"When the world burns at the end of time, he swallows all that fire into his belly.⁴² The fire keeps burning, but it don't hurt him.

"He lifts up a whole Buddha-land from the bottom of reality, raises it past countless worlds—light as picking up a leaf on a needle—nothing gets hurt.⁴³

"He shows up as a Buddha, shows up as a solitary sage, shows up as an elder, shows up as a king, shows up as a god.⁴⁴

"Every sound in all the worlds—high, low, in between—he turns them all into the Buddha's voice,⁴⁵ preaching impermanence, suffering, emptiness, no-self. Preaching whatever all the Buddhas preach. Everybody hears it.

"Shariputra, that's the short version.⁴⁶ If I told you everything, I'd still be talking at the end of time."

## Old Kashyapa Can't Believe It

Mahakashyapa heard all this and sighed.⁴⁷ He turned to Shariputra and said: "It's like showing colors to a blind man.⁴⁸ He can't see them. That's us—all us elders. We hear about this Inconceivable Liberation, and we can't understand it.

"Any wise person who hears this should want to become a Buddha.⁴⁹ But us? We cut off our roots.⁵⁰ We're like spoiled seeds. We can't grow anymore.

"Every monk who hears this should weep.⁵¹ Our cries should shake the universe.

"But every bodhisattva should rejoice!⁵² Should receive this teaching on the crown of their head. Once a bodhisattva understands this, no demon can touch him."⁵³

When Kashyapa said that, thirty-two thousand gods woke up to the wish for Buddhahood.⁵⁴

## The Demons Are Bodhisattvas in Disguise

Then Vimalakirti dropped another bomb.⁵⁵

"Kashyapa! In countless worlds, the ones playing the role of Demon King? Most of them are bodhisattvas in the Inconceivable Liberation.⁵⁶ They use that disguise to teach beings through skillful means.

"And all those beings in countless lands who come begging for hands, feet, eyes, brains, blood, skin, wives, children, treasure?⁵⁷ Most of them are also bodhisattvas testing other bodhisattvas.⁵⁸

"Why? Because a bodhisattva in the Inconceivable Liberation has real power.⁵⁹ He can create trials that look impossible. Ordinary folks can't test bodhisattvas like that.⁶⁰ It's like a dragon-elephant trampling—a donkey couldn't do it.⁶¹

"That's the gate of wisdom and skill for bodhisattvas in the Inconceivable Liberation."⁶²

**Theological Note**: This chapter is pure magic and metaphysics at their most radical. The "Inconceivable" isn't just impressive—it demolishes ordinary reality. The lesson? The world you see isn't fixed. A bodhisattva can remake it at will. And the demons you fear? Might be your teachers in disguise. As the Blues says: "Everything that rises must converge." Even Māra.
