# Chapter 5: Manjuśrī Asks About the Sickness

## The Only One Bold Enough to Visit

*Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim*

## The Buddha Sends Word

So the Buddha turns to Manjuśrī—the wisest of the wise, the one they call the Prince of Wisdom—and says: "Go check on Vimalakīrti. See what's ailing him."

Now, Manjuśrī ain't stupid. He knows exactly who he's dealing with. He tells the Buddha straight:

"Lord, this man is *dangerous*. Not dangerous like he'll hurt you—dangerous like he'll expose every lie you ever told yourself. He's penetrated the deepest truth. His words cut like a blade. His eloquence never stutters. His wisdom has no walls. He knows every move in the bodhisattva playbook, and he's got the keys to every secret the Buddhas ever kept. He's already beaten the demons and plays with supernatural powers like a kid with toys. His wisdom and his hustle are both completely on point.

"But alright. Since you're asking, I'll go."

## The Whole Town Wants In

Soon as folks heard that Manjuśrī was heading over to Vimalakīrti's place, everybody wanted to see the show. Eight thousand bodhisattvas. Five hundred monks. Hundreds of thousands of gods and humans. The word on the street was:

*"When those two get to talking, something holy is about to drop."*

So they all rolled out—Manjuśrī leading the way, the whole crew following behind—right through the gates of Vaiśālī, straight to Vimalakīrti's door.

---

## The Empty Room

Meanwhile, Vimalakīrti already knew they were coming. Man didn't even have to look out the window—he just *knew*.

So what does he do? He clears out the whole house. Every piece of furniture, every servant, every decoration—*gone*. Just one bed in an empty room, and Vimalakīrti lying on it, looking like death warmed over.

When Manjuśrī walked in, the place was bare. Nothing but a sick man on a cot.

And Vimalakīrti opens with: "Welcome, Manjuśrī! You *came* without coming. You *see* without seeing."

Manjuśrī didn't miss a beat: "That's right, householder. Once you've come, you don't come again. Once you've gone, you don't go again. Coming has no departure point; going has no destination. What can be seen can't be seen anymore.

"But let's skip the philosophy for now. How are you *feeling*? Can you bear it? Is the treatment helping? The Buddha sends his regards. What's the root of this sickness? How long you been down? And how do we make it stop?"

---

## The Sickness of Love

Vimalakīrti looked at him and said:

"My illness comes from ignorance and craving. Because *all beings* are sick, I am sick. If they got well, I'd get well.

"You see, a bodhisattva enters this mess—birth, death, the whole cycle—*for them*. And where there's birth and death, there's sickness. If they were free of sickness, I wouldn't have a cough.

"It's like a father with an only child. When the kid gets sick, the father gets sick. When the kid recovers, so does the old man. That's me with all beings—they're my children. When they hurt, I hurt. When they heal, I heal.

"You asked what causes this illness? *Compassion*. Pure, bone-deep compassion. That's the diagnosis."

---

## The Empty House Dialogue

Manjuśrī looked around the bare room and asked: "Why's this place empty? No servants? No furniture?"

Vimalakīrti: "All Buddha-lands are empty too."

"Empty how?"

"Empty by emptiness."

"What's the use of empty emptiness?"

"It's empty because it doesn't discriminate."

"Can emptiness be discriminated?"

"Discrimination is also empty."

"Where do you find emptiness?"

"In the sixty-two wrong views."

"Where do you find the wrong views?"

"In the liberation of all Buddhas."

"Where do you find that liberation?"

"In the minds of all beings.

"And as for my servants? The demons and heretics *are* my attendants. Why? The demons love birth-and-death, and I don't abandon birth-and-death. The heretics love their philosophies, and I ain't shaken by philosophies."

---

## What Kind of Sickness Is This?

Manjuśrī kept probing: "What's the *nature* of this illness?"

Vimalakīrti: "It has no form. You can't see it."

"Is it in the body or the mind?"

"Neither. The body is transcended. The mind is an illusion."

"Which of the four elements is sick? Earth, water, fire, or wind?"

"None of them—and all of them. The sickness ain't in the earth, but it doesn't leave the earth either. Same with the others. Beings get sick because they're made of elements. Because they're sick, I'm sick."

---

## How to Comfort a Sick Bodhisattva

Manjuśrī asked: "If a bodhisattva gets sick, how should another bodhisattva comfort them?"

Vimalakīrti laid it out:

"Tell them the body is impermanent—but don't tell them to hate it. Tell them the body suffers—but don't tell them to run to nirvana. Tell them there's no self—but keep teaching them. Tell them the body is empty—but don't tell them everything ends.

"Tell them to repent past wrongs—but don't get lost in the past. Feel their pain through your own. Remember all the suffering from countless lives. Think of helping all beings. Remember the good you've done. Stay steady. Don't stress.

"And be a doctor. Heal what's broken. That's how you comfort a sick bodhisattva—and that's how you make them smile."

---

## How to Train the Mind

Manjuśrī asked: "How should a sick bodhisattva discipline their mind?"

Vimalakīrti:

"Think like this: 'This sickness comes from the confusion and afflictions of past lives. There's no real thing here—who's the one getting sick? The body is just four elements thrown together with a label. No owner. No self.

"'This sickness comes from clinging to a self. So stop clinging.'

"Once you know the root, drop the idea of 'me' and drop the idea of 'beings.' Just see dharmas—processes, patterns, moments rising and falling. When they rise, they don't say 'I rise.' When they fall, they don't say 'I fall.'

"Then drop *that* too. Even the idea of dharmas is confusion. Confusion is the disease. Let it go.

"How? Let go of 'me' and 'mine.' How? Let go of duality. How? Stop thinking inside and outside. Practice equality.

"What's equality? Self and nirvana are equal. Why? Both are empty. Just names. No fixed reality. When you get this, there's no other sickness—just the sickness of emptiness. And that sickness is also empty.

"The sick bodhisattva receives without receiving. They haven't finished the Buddha's work yet, so they don't shut down experience just to get a diploma."

---

## The Real Practice

"If the body hurts, think of the poor souls in the hell realms and feel for them. If you've trained yourself, train others. Remove their illness without removing the teaching.

"What's the root of illness? Grasping. What are we grasping? The three realms. How do you stop? By having nothing to get. Nothing to get, nothing to grab. Nothing to grab, no sickness at its root.

"Manjuśrī, this is how a sick bodhisattva trains the mind—to cut off old age, sickness, and death. That's real awakening. Otherwise, all your practice is useless. Defeating enemies makes you brave; defeating aging and death makes you a bodhisattva."

---

## The Two Kinds of Compassion

"The sick bodhisattva should also think: 'My illness isn't real. Neither is theirs.'

"But when you observe beings like this, if you start feeling compassion mixed with attachment—*love-view compassion*—you gotta let it go. That kind of compassion burns you out.

"The Buddha said it plain: 'A man in chains can't free another man in chains. Only the free man can liberate.'

"So don't get yourself chained. What's a chain? Getting hooked on meditation bliss. What's freedom? Using skillful means.

"Wisdom alone is a trap. Wisdom *with* skillful means is liberation.
Skillful means alone is a trap. Skillful means *with* wisdom is liberation.

"If you purify the world with a mind full of attachment? Trap.
If you purify the world *without* attachment? Free.

"If you stay in the mud of desire while trying to grow virtue? Trap.
If you leave the mud, grow virtues, and aim for full awakening? Free.

"The body is impermanent, suffering, empty, no-self—that's wisdom. Staying in the game of birth and death to help others without getting tired—that's skillful means.

"The body doesn't leave sickness; sickness doesn't leave the body—that's wisdom. But not ending it all just to escape—that's skillful means."

---

## The Middle Way of the Bodhisattva

"Train your mind—but don't *live* in that trained mind. And don't live in an untrained one either. Living in confusion is the fool's way. Living in control is the monk's way. The bodhisattva leaves both behind.

"Living in birth-and-death without being stained.
Living in nirvana without being extinct.
Neither ordinary nor holy—that's the bodhisattva way.
Neither dirty nor clean—that's the path.

"Though you've surpassed the demons, you still show up to beat them.
Though you seek all-knowledge, you don't force it before its time.
Though you see that nothing arises, you don't fall into the void.
Though you understand dependent origination, you walk into heresy without flinching.
Though you gather all beings, you don't cling to them.
Though you love solitude, you don't burn out body and mind.
Though you work in all three realms, you don't damage reality.
Though you practice emptiness, you plant virtue.
Though you practice formlessness, you still liberate beings.
Though you practice desirelessness, you still show up in a body.
Though you practice non-arising, you arise in every good act.

"Though you master the six perfections, you read every heart.
Though you master the six supernatural powers, you don't end the leaks.
Though you cultivate the four boundless hearts, you don't crave rebirth in heaven.
Though you practice meditation and samādhi, you don't get stuck there.
Though you practice mindfulness, you stay in body, feelings, mind, and dharmas.
Though you practice right effort, you don't abandon the work of body and mind.
Though you walk the Eightfold Path, you delight in the infinite path.
Though you practice calming and insight, you don't fall into extinction.
Though you realize non-arising, you adorn yourself with marks of beauty.
Though you look like a monk or hermit, you never abandon the Buddha-dharma.
Though you follow ultimate purity, you still appear in bodies as needed.
Though you see all Buddha-lands as empty as space, you still manifest pure lands.
Though you attain Buddhahood, turn the wheel, and enter nirvana—you never leave the bodhisattva path."

## The Crowd Wakes Up

When those words landed, eight thousand gods in the room woke up. Right there, they set their hearts on complete, perfect, unexcelled awakening.

## Bluesman's Notes

### What Just Happened Here?

This is the chapter where things get *real*. Manjuśrī—the sharpest mind in the Buddha's whole crew—finally walks into the arena to face Vimalakīrti. And what happens?

Philosophy at the speed of lightning.

Every question Manjuśrī asks, Vimalakīrti flips. The sickness isn't in the body or the mind. The room is empty because Buddha-lands are empty. Liberation is found in the wrong views. Freedom is sought in the chains.

This is the Dharma of inversion. The bodhisattva doesn't flee samsara—they *use* it. They don't escape illness—they *become* it. For others.

### The Blues Parallel

This is Doctor Blues territory. The old healer who's been through so much suffering that he *absorbs* the pain of everyone who comes to his door. Not because he's a masochist—because he *loves*.

That "illness of compassion" is the same thing Muddy Waters meant when he said, "Got my mojo workin'." It's not magic. It's presence. It's being *with* the suffering instead of running from it.

When Vimalakīrti says his illness comes from compassion—that all beings are sick so he's sick—he's saying what every real bluesman knows: *You can't sing the blues if you haven't lived them.*

### The Empty Room

The empty room is the ultimate stage. No props. No distractions. Just one bed and one sick man who somehow contains the entire universe.

This is Vimalakīrti's Dharma hall. And it's empty because *everything is*.
