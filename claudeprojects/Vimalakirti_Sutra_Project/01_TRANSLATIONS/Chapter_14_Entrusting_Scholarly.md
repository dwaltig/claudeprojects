## The Buddha Entrusts to Maitreya

At that time, the Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Maitreya:¹ "Maitreya! I now entrust to you the Dharma of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*² that I have gathered over immeasurable millions of asaṃkhyeya kalpas.³ Such sūtras as this, in the final age after the Buddha's parinirvāṇa,⁴ you and your kind should use supernatural power to widely proclaim and circulate them throughout Jambudvīpa.⁵ Do not let them be cut off.

"Why is this so? In future ages, there will be good men and good women,⁶ as well as devas, nāgas, spirits, gandharvas, and rakṣasas,⁷ who generate the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi* and delight in the great Dharma.⁸ If such sūtras are not heard, they will lose this excellent benefit.⁹

"When such people hear these sūtras, they will certainly believe and delight in them greatly, generating a rare aspiration.¹⁰ They should receive them with the crown of their heads.¹¹ According to what benefits sentient beings are fit to receive, broadly explain for them."¹²

## Two Characteristics of Bodhisattvas

"Maitreya! You should know: bodhisattvas have two characteristics.¹³ What are the two?

"First, they delight in elaborate phrases and literary adornment.¹⁴

"Second, they do not fear profound meaning and can truly enter it.¹⁵

"Those who delight in elaborate phrases and literary adornment—know that these are new-learner bodhisattvas.¹⁶ Those who, regarding such undefiled, unattached, extremely profound sūtras,¹⁷ have no fear, can enter them, and upon hearing purify their minds,¹⁸ accepting, upholding, reading, reciting, and practicing as taught—know that these are long-practiced in the path.¹⁹

## Two Dharmas Hindering New Learners

"Maitreya! There are another two dharmas that cause those called new learners to be unable to determine regarding profound Dharma.²⁰ What are the two?

"First, having never heard profound sūtras before, when they hear them they are startled, doubt, and cannot follow.²¹ They slander and do not believe, saying: 'I have never heard this before—from where has it come?'²²

"Second, if there are those who protect, uphold, and explain such profound sūtras, they refuse to approach, serve, or revere them.²³ Sometimes they speak of their faults.²⁴

"Having these two dharmas, know that this is a new-learner bodhisattva, who injures himself²⁵ and cannot, in profound Dharma, train his mind."²⁶

---

## Two Dharmas Hindering Progress

"Maitreya! There are another two dharmas: although a bodhisattva believes and understands profound Dharma, he still injures himself and cannot attain the patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas.²⁷ What are the two?

"First, slighting new-learner bodhisattvas and not teaching them.²⁸

"Second, although understanding profound Dharma, yet grasping at characteristics and making discriminations.²⁹

"These are the two."³⁰

## Maitreya's Response

When the Bodhisattva Maitreya heard this, he said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! Unprecedented! As the Buddha has taught, I shall distance myself from such evils³¹ and uphold the Dharma of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi* that the Tathāgata has gathered over countless asaṃkhyeya kalpas.³²

"If in future ages there are good men and good women who seek the Mahāyāna,³³ I shall cause them to obtain such sūtras in their hands.³⁴ I shall give them the power of mindfulness, enabling them to accept, uphold, read, recite, and broadly explain to others.³⁵

"World-Honored One! If in the final age there are those who can accept, uphold, read, recite, and explain for others,³⁶ know that these are all established through Maitreya's supernatural power."³⁷

---

## The Buddha's Approval

The Buddha said: "Excellent, excellent! Maitreya! As you have said, the Buddha rejoices with you."³⁸

---

## All Bodhisattvas Vow

At that time, all the bodhisattvas joined palms and said to the Buddha: "We also, after the Tathāgata's parinirvāṇa, shall widely proclaim and circulate the Dharma of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi* throughout the lands of the ten directions.³⁹ We shall also guide those who teach the Dharma, enabling them to obtain this sūtra."⁴⁰

---

## The Four Heavenly Kings Vow

At that time, the Four Heavenly Kings⁴¹ said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! In all places—cities, villages, towns, mountain forests, or wilderness—wherever this sūtra-scroll exists, wherever it is read, recited, and explained,⁴² we shall lead our retinues there to hear the Dharma. We shall protect those persons, guarding them for a hundred yojanas in every direction,⁴³ not letting any who seek an opportunity against them find one."⁴⁴

---

## The Sūtra's Transmission

At that time, the Buddha addressed Ānanda: "Accept and uphold this sūtra and broadly circulate and proclaim it."⁴⁵

Ānanda said: "So be it! I have accepted and upheld its essentials.⁴⁶ World-Honored One! What should this sūtra be called?"⁴⁷

---

## The Name of the Sūtra

The Buddha said: "Ānanda! This sūtra is called 'The Teaching of Vimalakirti.'⁴⁸ It is also called 'The Dharma-Gate of Inconceivable Liberation.'⁴⁹ Thus should you accept and uphold it."⁵⁰

---

## The Conclusion

When the Buddha had finished teaching this sūtra, the elder Vimalakirti, Mañjuśrī, Śāriputra, Ānanda, and all the devas, humans, asuras, and the entire great assembly heard what the Buddha taught.⁵¹ All were greatly delighted.⁵²

### Key Concepts

**Entrusting to Maitreya**: The future buddha is charged with maintaining the teaching. This establishes a lineage of protection reaching into the Dharma-ending age.

**Two Types of Bodhisattvas**: Those attached to literary beauty versus those who enter profound meaning without fear. This diagnostic helps practitioners understand their own level.

**Four Self-Injuries**: 
1. Fear and rejection of profound sūtras
2. Avoiding and criticizing teachers
3. Slighting new learners
4. Grasping characteristics even while understanding

**The Two Names**: "The Teaching of Vimalakirti" (personal) and "The Dharma-Gate of Inconceivable Liberation" (doctrinal) together summarize the sūtra's character.
