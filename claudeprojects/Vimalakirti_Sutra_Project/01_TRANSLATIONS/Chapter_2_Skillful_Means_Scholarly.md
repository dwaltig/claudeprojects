**Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel**

## Introduction of Vimalakirti

At that time, in the great city of Vaiśālī there was an elder named Vimalakirti.¹ He had already made offerings to immeasurable buddhas, had deeply planted wholesome roots,² and had attained the patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas.³ His eloquence was unobstructed; he sported with spiritual powers⁴ and had acquired all the dhāraṇīs.⁵ He had obtained fearlessness, had subdued Māra and his demonic forces. He had entered the profound Dharma-gate, was skilled in the perfection of wisdom,⁶ and had thoroughly mastered skillful means.⁷ His great vows had been accomplished. He clearly understood how the minds of sentient beings tend, and he was also able to distinguish the sharp and dull faculties of beings. Long had he been on the Buddha-path, his mind already ripened and resolved,⁸ his decision fixed on the Mahāyāna. Whatever he did, he was able to reflect skillfully. He dwelt in the Buddha's deportment, his mind vast as the ocean. All the buddhas praised him; he was revered by disciples, Śakra, Brahmā, and world-protectors.⁹

In order to save beings, he used skillful means to reside in Vaiśālī. His wealth was immeasurable, and he used it to embrace the poor. He was pure in upholding the precepts, and through this embraced those who violated the precepts. Through patient endurance and regulated conduct, he embraced those prone to anger. Through great vigor, he embraced the lazy. Through one-pointedness and meditative quiescence,¹⁰ he embraced those of scattered minds. Through decisive wisdom, he embraced those lacking wisdom.

Though he was a layman wearing white robes,¹¹ he maintained the pure discipline of a śramaṇa.¹² Though living the householder's life, he was unattached to the three realms.¹³ Though manifesting as having a wife and children, he constantly cultivated pure conduct.¹⁴ Though manifesting as having a household, he constantly delighted in solitude. Though wearing precious ornaments, he adorned his body with the marks and characteristics.¹⁵ Though eating and drinking,¹⁶ he relished the flavor of meditative joy. If he went to gambling halls and gaming houses, he used it solely to save beings. He received the teachings of various non-Buddhist paths without losing his true faith. Though well-versed in worldly texts, he constantly delighted in the Buddha-Dharma. He was revered by all who saw him, as the most excellent among those to be honored. Managing all livelihood and trade, though he acquired worldly gain, he took no joy in it.¹⁷

Traveling through the four main streets, he benefited sentient beings. Entering the halls of government, he protected all.¹⁸ Entering the houses of discourse, he led them with the Mahāyāna. Entering the schools, he enlightened the children.¹⁹ Entering the houses of prostitution, he revealed the transgressions of desire. Entering the wine houses, he could establish their resolve.

When among the elders, he was the most honored among elders, expounding the supreme Dharma. When among householders, he was the most honored among householders, severing their attachments. When among the kṣatriyas,²⁰ he was the most honored among kṣatriyas, teaching them patience. When among the brahmins,²¹ he was the most honored among brahmins, eliminating their pride. When among the great ministers, he was the most honored among great ministers, teaching them the true Dharma. When among the princes, he was the most honored among princes, revealing loyalty and filial piety. When among the palace officials, he was the most honored among palace officials, transforming the court women. When among the common people, he was the most honored among common people, causing them to cultivate merit. When among the Brahmā-devas, he was the most honored among Brahmā-devas, instructing them in supreme wisdom. When among Śakra, he was the most honored among Śakras, manifesting impermanence. When among the world-protectors, he was the most honored among world-protectors, protecting all sentient beings.

Thus did the elder Vimalakirti, using such immeasurable skillful means, benefit sentient beings.

## The Dharma of Impermanence: Vimalakirti's Teaching Through Illness

Using these skillful means, he manifested that his body was ill.²² Because of his illness, kings, great ministers, elders, householders, brahmins, and so forth, as well as princes and various officials—an uncountable multitude of thousands—all came to inquire about his illness.

To those who came, Vimalakirti, using his bodily illness, extensively expounded the Dharma:

"Benevolent ones! This body is impermanent,²³ without strength, without power, without solidity, a thing that rapidly decays—it cannot be trusted!²⁴ Being the source of suffering and affliction, it is where all diseases gather. Benevolent ones! Such a body the wise do not rely upon.

"This body is like a mass of foam—it cannot be grasped.²⁵ This body is like a bubble—it cannot long endure.²⁶ This body is like a mirage—born from thirst and craving.²⁷ This body is like a plantain tree—at its core there is nothing solid.²⁸ This body is like an illusion—arising from mental inversion.²⁹ This body is like a dream—perceived as a false vision. This body is like a shadow—appearing from karmic conditions.³⁰ This body is like an echo—dependent upon causes and conditions. This body is like a floating cloud—changing and dissolving in an instant.³¹ This body is like lightning—not abiding even for a thought-moment.³²

"This body is without a permanent master—it is like the earth.³³ This body is without a self—it is like fire.³⁴ This body is without longevity—it is like the wind.³⁵ This body is without a person—it is like water.³⁶ This body is not real—the four great elements are its home.³⁷ This body is empty—separate from 'I' and 'mine.'³⁸ This body is without awareness—like grass, trees, tiles, and pebbles. This body is without agency—turned by the power of the wind.³⁹ This body is not pure—filled with filth and corruption.⁴⁰ This body is falsity—though one bathes, clothes, and feeds it, it inevitably decays. This body is a disaster—afflicted by a hundred and one illnesses.⁴¹ This body is like an old well—pressed upon by age.⁴² This body has no fixed term—it will certainly die.⁴³ This body is like a venomous snake, like a hateful thief, like an empty village—it is a composite of the aggregates, realms, and sense-bases.⁴⁴

## The Buddha-Body: From the Conditioned to the Unconditioned

"Benevolent ones! This body should be despised and wearied of. You should take joy in the Buddha-body.⁴⁵ Why is this so? The Buddha-body is the Dharma-body.⁴⁶ It is born from immeasurable merit and wisdom. It is born from moral discipline, concentration, wisdom, liberation, and liberation-knowledge-and-vision.⁴⁷ It is born from loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity.⁴⁸ It is born from giving, moral discipline, patience, gentleness, diligent practice of vigor, meditative concentration, liberation, samādhi, learning, and the wisdom of the pāramitās.⁴⁹ It is born from skillful means. It is born from the six spiritual penetrations.⁵⁰ It is born from the three insights.⁵¹ It is born from the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment.⁵² It is born from cessation and contemplation.⁵³ It is born from the ten powers, four fearlessnesses, and eighteen unique qualities.⁵⁴ It is born from severing all unwholesome dharmas and gathering all wholesome dharmas. It is born from reality. It is born from non-negligence.⁵⁵

"From such immeasurable pure dharmas the Tathāgata's body is born. Benevolent ones! If you wish to attain the Buddha-body, to sever the illnesses of all sentient beings, you should generate the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*.⁵⁶"

Thus did the elder Vimalakirti, according to the occasion, expound the Dharma to those who came to inquire about his illness, causing countless thousands of persons to generate the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*.

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Footnotes

¹ **[Textual]** Vimalakirti (維摩詰, *Vimalakīrti*). Literally "Stainless Reputation" or "Pure Fame." A wealthy householder of Vaiśālī who exemplifies the Mahāyāna ideal of an enlightened layperson. His name in full is sometimes given as Vimalakirti-nirdeśa, "The Teaching of Vimalakirti." The fact that the sutra's protagonist is a layman rather than a monk is revolutionary, challenging the assumption that awakening is the exclusive domain of monastics.

² **[Philosophical]** Wholesome roots (善本, *kuśala-mūla*). The fundamental virtuous qualities that serve as the basis for spiritual development: non-greed, non-hatred, and non-delusion. Vimalakirti's "deep" planting of these roots indicates countless lifetimes of cultivation.

³ **[Philosophical]** Patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas (無生忍, *anutpattika-dharma-kṣānti*). A high bodhisattva attainment indicating direct realization that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence—they neither truly arise nor cease. This marks irreversibility on the path.

⁴ **[Philosophical]** Sporting with spiritual powers (遊戲神通, *ṛddhi-vikurvita*). The term "sporting" (遊戲) suggests that Vimalakirti uses supernatural abilities playfully, without attachment. Unlike powers demonstrated to impress, his are expressions of freedom and compassion. **[Cross-reference]** This playful use of powers will be dramatically demonstrated in Chapter 6 when he performs miraculous feats like fitting 32,000 lion-thrones in his small room.

⁵ **[Textual]** Dhāraṇī (總持, *dhāraṇī*). Mystical formulas or mnemonic devices that encapsulate teachings. Having "acquired all dhāraṇīs" means complete mastery of all Buddhist teachings.

⁶ **[Philosophical]** Perfection of wisdom (智度, *prajñā-pāramitā*). The culmination of Buddhist understanding—insight into the empty, interdependent nature of all phenomena. Vimalakirti embodies this perfection.

⁷ **[Philosophical]** Skillful means (方便, *upāya-kauśalya*). **KEY THEME** of this chapter. The adaptive methods by which awakened beings teach the Dharma in forms suited to the capacities of different beings. Vimalakirti's mastery of skillful means allows him to enter every sphere of society—from gambling halls to palaces to brothels—using each as an occasion for teaching.

⁸ **[Philosophical]** Mind ripened and resolved (心已純淑, *paripāka-citta*). The stage when a bodhisattva's mind has been purified through long practice and is ready for final awakening.

⁹ **[Textual]** World-protectors (世主, *lokapāla*). The four guardian kings who protect Buddhism and the world. That they revere Vimalakirti emphasizes his elevated spiritual status.

¹⁰ **[Philosophical]** Meditative quiescence (禪寂, *dhyāna-śānti*). Deep states of meditative absorption characterized by tranquility and clarity.

¹¹ **[Philosophical]** Wearing white robes (白衣, *avadāta-vasana*). Standard term for a layperson, in contrast to the colored or patched robes of monastics. The description that follows systematically contrasts Vimalakirti's external appearance as a worldly householder with his inner accomplishment as an awakened being.

¹² **[Textual]** Śramaṇa (沙門, *śramaṇa*). A religious mendicant or renunciant. The term originally applied to non-Brahmanical ascetics and was adopted by Buddhists to describe monks and nuns.

¹³ **[Philosophical]** Three realms (三界, *tri-dhātu*). The desire realm, form realm, and formless realm—the entire cosmos of rebirth. To be "unattached to the three realms" while living as a householder is the bodhisattva's achievement of liberation without withdrawal from the world.

¹⁴ **[Philosophical]** Pure conduct (梵行, *brahmacarya*). Traditionally implies celibacy, but here indicates that even while manifesting as a husband, Vimalakirti maintains the purity of one who has transcended desire. His family life is a teaching device, not a concession to worldliness.

¹⁵ **[Philosophical]** Marks and characteristics (相好, *lakṣaṇa-vyañjana*). The thirty-two major marks and eighty secondary characteristics of a buddha or advanced bodhisattva. Vimalakirti's true adornment is this spiritual radiance, not his jewelry.

¹⁶ **[Philosophical]** Though eating and drinking (雖復飲食). The text suggests that while he participates in worldly meals, his true nourishment is meditative joy (禪悅, *dhyāna-prīti*). **[Cross-reference]** This anticipates Chapter 10 on the Accumulated Fragrance Buddha, where food itself becomes a Dharma-teaching.

¹⁷ **[Philosophical]** No joy in worldly gain. Vimalakirti engages fully in commerce without attachment to profit—a model for the spirituality of the marketplace. **[Modern]** This anticipates contemporary discussions of "engaged Buddhism" and the integration of practice with ordinary life.

¹⁸ **[Textual]** Halls of government (治政法, *rāja-kārya*). Vimalakirti enters political spaces to protect beings, suggesting that governance can be a field of bodhisattva practice.

¹⁹ **[Textual]** Schools (學堂). The term 誘開童蒙 suggests leading children out of ignorance, making education another field of skillful means.

²⁰ **[Textual]** Kṣatriya (剎利, *kṣatriya*). The warrior and ruling class in Indian society. Teaching them "patience" (忍辱, *kṣānti*) addresses their particular predisposition to violence.

²¹ **[Textual]** Brahmin (婆羅門, *brāhmaṇa*). The priestly class. Teaching them to eliminate "pride" (我慢, *ātma-māna*) addresses their tendency toward spiritual arrogance.

²² **[Philosophical]** **CENTRAL TEACHING**: Vimalakirti's illness as skillful means (方便現身有疾). The chapter's core narrative device. Vimalakirti does not actually have an illness—he manifests illness as a teaching tool to attract visitors and create an opportunity for Dharma discourse. This brilliantly demonstrates that even suffering can be a form of compassionate activity. His "illness" mirrors the illness of all sentient beings bound by delusion and becomes the occasion for revealing the path to the Buddha-body.

²³ **[Philosophical]** Impermanent (無常, *anitya*). The first of the three marks of existence. The entire teaching that follows systematically exposes the body's lack of the four qualities misattributed to it by the deluded: permanence, strength, power, and solidity.

²⁴ **[Philosophical]** Cannot be trusted (不可信). The body's unreliability stems from its conditioned nature. This echoes the Buddha's final teaching in the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta: "All conditioned things are impermanent. Work out your salvation with diligence."

²⁵ **[Philosophical]** Like a mass of foam (如聚沫, *phenopiṇḍa*). From the *Phena Sutta* (SN 22.95), where the Buddha compares the five aggregates to foam, bubbles, mirages, plantain, and illusions. Vimalakirti draws directly from this imagery. **[Cross-reference]** This series of similes appears in multiple sutras and became a standard teaching on the insubstantiality of selfhood.

²⁶ **[Philosophical]** Like a bubble (如泡, *budbuda*). Water bubbles arise and burst instantaneously, illustrating the body's momentariness.

²⁷ **[Philosophical]** Like a mirage (如炎, *marīci*). The mirage arises from heat and craving (渴愛, *tṛṣṇā*), just as the illusory self arises from thirst for existence.

²⁸ **[Philosophical]** Like a plantain tree (如芭蕉, *kadalī*). The plantain trunk, when peeled layer by layer, reveals no solid core—a perfect metaphor for the body analyzed into its components.

²⁹ **[Philosophical]** Like an illusion from mental inversion (如幻從顛倒起, *viparyāsa*). The four inversions are seeing permanence in the impermanent, pleasure in suffering, self in the selfless, and purity in the impure. The illusory body arises from these cognitive distortions.

³⁰ **[Philosophical]** Like a shadow from karmic conditions (如影從業緣現). The body is a karmic shadow—not an independent entity but a projection of past actions appearing through causal conditions.

³¹ **[Philosophical]** Like a floating cloud (如浮雲). Clouds transform and disperse moment by moment, having no stable essence.

³² **[Philosophical]** Like lightning (如電念念不住). The most transient of all images—lightning exists for less than a moment. The phrase "念念不住" (not abiding even for a thought-moment) indicates the doctrine of momentariness (*kṣaṇika*): even within what appears to be a single moment, the body is constantly perishing and arising.

³³ **[Philosophical]** Like the earth, without permanent master (如地無主). The earth element in the body belongs to no one—it simply follows natural laws. The four element analysis (earth, water, fire, wind) that follows deconstructs the body into impersonal processes.

³⁴ **[Philosophical]** Like fire, without self (如火無我). The fire element (heat, digestion) operates without an agent directing it.

³⁵ **[Philosophical]** Like wind, without longevity (如風無壽). The breath and vital wind will inevitably cease—there is no permanent life-force.

³⁶ **[Philosophical]** Like water, without person (如水無人). The fluid elements in the body do not constitute a "person"—they are simply water following its nature.

³⁷ **[Philosophical]** Four great elements (四大, *mahā-bhūta*). Earth (solidity), water (cohesion), fire (heat), and wind (movement)—the physical constituents that make up the body. Calling them the body's "home" emphasizes that there is no self residing within, only these impersonal elements temporarily combined.

³⁸ **[Philosophical]** Empty, separate from 'I' and 'mine' (為空離我我所). The core teaching of *anātman*—the body contains neither a self nor anything belonging to a self. It is fundamentally empty of inherent existence.

³⁹ **[Philosophical]** Turned by the power of the wind (風力所轉). The body moves not by personal will but by the wind element and causal forces. This challenges the sense of agency we attribute to voluntary action.

⁴⁰ **[Philosophical]** Filled with filth (穢惡充滿). The traditional meditation on the thirty-two impure parts of the body, intended to counteract attachment through contemplation of the body's nature.

⁴¹ **[Textual]** Hundred and one illnesses (百一病). A conventional expression for the many diseases that afflict the body.

⁴² **[Philosophical]** Like an old well (如丘井). An old well that has run dry, pressed upon by the weight of age—unable to provide sustenance.

⁴³ **[Philosophical]** Will certainly die (為要當死). The body's only certainty is death. This "no fixed term" (無定) means death can come at any moment.

⁴⁴ **[Philosophical]** Composite of aggregates, realms, and sense-bases (陰界諸入所共合成). A technical summary of Buddhist phenomenology. The five aggregates (*skandha*), eighteen realms (*dhātu*), and twelve sense-bases (*āyatana*) are overlapping classification systems for analyzed experience. The body is nothing more than this combination—no self can be found in or outside these components. **[Cross-reference]** The "empty village" (空聚) image appears in the Pāli Canon as a metaphor for the selfless body.

⁴⁵ **[Philosophical]** Buddha-body (佛身, *buddhakāya*). The transition from aversion to the conditioned body to aspiration for the Buddha-body marks the pivot of Vimalakirti's teaching. However, this is not escapism—the Buddha-body is realized precisely through transformation of the present moment, not abandonment of embodied existence.

⁴⁶ **[Philosophical]** **KEY DOCTRINE**: Buddha-body is Dharma-body (佛身者即法身也, *buddhakāyo dharmakayas*). This equation is central to Mahāyāna christology. The Buddha's true body is not physical form but reality itself—the Dharma. This teaching will later develop into the trikāya (three-body) doctrine distinguishing the dharmakāya (dharma-body), saṃbhogakāya (enjoyment-body), and nirmāṇakāya (manifestation-body).

⁴⁷ **[Philosophical]** Liberation-knowledge-and-vision (解脫知見, *vimukti-jñāna-darśana*). The fifth of the five aspects of dharmakāya in earlier Abhidharma: morality, concentration, wisdom, liberation, and knowledge-and-vision of liberation.

⁴⁸ **[Philosophical]** Four immeasurables (慈悲喜捨, *brahma-vihāra*). Loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity—meditations that generate the emotional basis of the Buddha-body.

⁴⁹ **[Philosophical]** Pāramitās (波羅蜜, *pāramitā*). The "perfections" or transcendent virtues, usually listed as six: giving, morality, patience, vigor, concentration, and wisdom. This passage expands the list to include additional qualities.

⁵⁰ **[Philosophical]** Six spiritual penetrations (六通, *ṣaḍ-abhijñā*). Divine eye, divine ear, knowledge of others' minds, memory of past lives, supernatural powers, and knowledge of the exhaustion of outflows.

⁵¹ **[Philosophical]** Three insights (三明, *tisro vidyāḥ*). Knowledge of past lives, the divine eye seeing beings' deaths and rebirths, and knowledge that the outflows are exhausted.

⁵² **[Philosophical]** Thirty-seven factors of enlightenment (三十七道品, *saptatriṃśad-bodhipakṣika-dharmāḥ*). The complete set of practices leading to awakening.

⁵³ **[Philosophical]** Cessation and contemplation (止觀, *śamatha-vipaśyanā*). The two wings of meditation: calming (*śamatha*) and insight (*vipaśyanā*). Their cultivation is the proximate cause of awakening.

⁵⁴ **[Philosophical]** Ten powers, four fearlessnesses, and eighteen unique qualities. The special attributes of a fully awakened buddha.

⁵⁵ **[Philosophical]** Non-negligence (不放逸, *apramāda*). Careful mindfulness and spiritual vigilance. The Buddha's dying words emphasized *apramāda* as the key to liberation.

⁵⁶ **[Philosophical]** Generate the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi* (發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心, *bodhicittotpāda*). The arising of the aspiration for supreme enlightenment—the fundamental act that initiates the bodhisattva path. Vimalakirti's entire discourse on the conditioned body's ills serves this ultimate purpose: to inspire the generation of *bodhicitta*.

### Key Concepts

**Skillful Means (*Upāya-kauśalya*)**: This chapter is the primary locus for the Vimalakirti Sutra's teaching on skillful means. Vimalakirti demonstrates that any context—secular or sacred, pure or impure—can become a field of awakening activity. His entry into gambling halls, brothels, and wine houses is not compromise but compassion in action. The enlightened mind transforms every situation into an opportunity for liberation.

**Lay Awakening**: The detailed description of Vimalakirti's lay status while surpassing monastic attainments is a direct challenge to the hierarchy that privileged renunciation over householder life. The sutra suggests that the distinction between lay and monastic is itself a form of dualistic thinking to be transcended. Vimalakirti "wears white robes" yet maintains "śramaṇa discipline"—form and formlessness coincide.

**Illness as Teaching**: Vimalakirti's manifested illness is the chapter's central device. It serves multiple functions: it draws visitors, creates an occasion for teaching, demonstrates non-attachment to the body, and—crucially—shows that even suffering can be skillful means. The bodhisattva does not eliminate suffering but transforms its meaning. This anticipates the sutra's later teachings on non-duality, where affliction and enlightenment are recognized as not-two.

**The Body Meditation**: The twelve similes for the body's impermanence and emptiness form a powerful contemplative sequence. These are not intellectual abstractions but objects for direct meditation. When fully realized, they lead to the "despising and wearying of" the conditioned body—not nihilistic disgust but liberating disenchantment that opens space for aspiration toward the Buddha-body.

**Buddha-Body as Dharma-Body**: The culminating teaching that "the Buddha-body is the Dharma-body" points beyond both the physical body and the mental constructs we project onto awakening. The Buddha's true body is truth itself—it is "born from" all the causes and conditions of awakening but is not produced as a conditioned thing. This is the body that transcends birth and death.
