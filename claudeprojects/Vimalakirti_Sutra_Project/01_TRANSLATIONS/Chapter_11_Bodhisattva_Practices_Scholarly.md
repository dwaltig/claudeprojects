## The Buddha's Audience

At that time, the Buddha was expounding the Dharma in the Āmrapālī Garden. Suddenly, the ground became vast and adorned, and the entire assembly turned golden-colored.

Ānanda asked the Buddha: "World Honored One! For what reason is there this auspicious sign? Why has this place suddenly become vast and adorned, and the entire assembly turned golden?"

The Buddha told Ānanda: "It is because Vimalakirti and Mañjuśrī, surrounded respectfully by a great multitude, generate the intention to come here; therefore, this auspicious sign appears first."

At that time, Vimalakirti said to Mañjuśrī: "We should go together to see the Buddha, to bow and make offerings."

Mañjuśrī said: "Excellent! Let us go! Now is exactly the right time."

Vimalakirti immediately used his supernatural power to hold the entire great multitude and the lion-seats in his right palm¹ and went to the Buddha's place. Upon arrival, he placed them on the ground. He bowed his head at the Buddha's feet, circumambulated him seven times to the right, put his palms together with single-mindedness, and stood to one side. The bodhisattvas immediately left their seats, bowed at the Buddha's feet, also circumambulated seven times, and stood to one side. The great disciples, Indra, Brahma, and the Four Heavenly Kings also left their seats, bowed at the Buddha's feet, and stood to one side.

Then the World Honored One comforted the bodhisattvas according to the Dharma and had them each sit down again; they all received his teaching. After the multitude was settled, the Buddha said to Śāriputra: "Did you see what the sovereign supernatural power of the Great Being (*Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva*) did?"

"Yes, indeed, I saw it!"

"What is your thought?"

"World Honored One! I see his actions as inconceivable. It is not what my mind can plan, nor what my calculation can measure."

## The Perfumed Assembly

At that time, Ānanda asked the Buddha: "World Honored One! The fragrance I smell now is one appearing for the first time since ancient days. What fragrance is this?"

The Buddha told Ānanda: "It is the fragrance from the pores of those bodhisattvas."

Then Śāriputra said to Ānanda: "Our pores are also emitting this fragrance!"

Ānanda said: "Where does it come from?"

[Śāriputra] said: "It is because the Elder Vimalakirti obtained the Buddha's leftover rice from the Accumulated Fragrance country and ate it in his house. Everyone's pores are fragrant like this."

Ānanda asked Vimalakirti: "How long will this fragrance last?"

Vimalakirti said: "Until this rice is digested."

"How long until the rice is digested?"

"The power of this rice lasts for seven days, and then it is digested. Furthermore, Ānanda! If a Śrāvaka who has not entered the Correct Position (*nyāma*) eats this rice, he will enter the Correct Position and then it will be digested. If he has already entered the Correct Position, he will obtain the liberation of mind, and then it will be digested. If one has not generated the Mahāyāna intent, eating this rice will cause him to generate the intent, and then it will be digested. If he has already generated the intent, he will obtain the Acceptance of Non-Arising (*anutpattika-dharma-kṣānti*), and then it will be digested. If he has already obtained the Acceptance of Non-Arising, he will reach the stage of being binding to only one more life (*eka-jāti-pratibuddha*), and then it will be digested. Like a medicine called 'Supreme Flavor'—if one takes it, all poisons in the body are destroyed, and only then is it digested. This rice is like this: it destroys the poison of all afflictions, and then it is digested."

Ānanda said to the Buddha: "Unprecedented, World Honored One! Such fragrant rice can perform Buddha-work."

The Buddha said: "It is so, it is so! Ānanda!
*   There are Buddha-lands that perform Buddha-work by means of Buddha-light.
*   There are those that perform Buddha-work by means of bodhisattvas.
*   There are those that perform Buddha-work by means of illusion-men created by the Buddha.
*   There are those that perform Buddha-work by means of the Bodhi tree.
*   There are those that perform Buddha-work by means of the Buddha's clothes and bedding.
*   There are those that perform Buddha-work by means of food and drink.
*   There are those that perform Buddha-work by means of gardens, terraces, and pavilions.
*   There are those that perform Buddha-work by means of the thirty-two marks and eighty secondary characteristics.
*   There are those that perform Buddha-work by means of the Buddha's body.
*   There are those that perform Buddha-work by means of empty space; sentient beings respond to this condition and enter the practice of discipline.
*   There are those that perform Buddha-work by means of metaphors like dreams, illusions, shadows, echoes, images in a mirror, the moon in water, and heat-mirages.
*   There are those that perform Buddha-work by means of sound, language, and words.
*   There are pure Buddha-lands that perform Buddha-work by means of silence, wordlessness, non-speaking, non-demonstration, non-cognition, non-doing, and non-action (*asamskrta*).

"Like this, Ānanda! Among the majestic ceremonies, movements, and activities of the Buddhas, there is nothing that is not Buddha-work.

"Ānanda! Although there are these four demons (*māras*) and 84,000 gates of affliction which tire out sentient beings, the Buddhas use these very Dharmas to perform Buddha-work. This is called entering the Dharma-door of all Buddhas. If a bodhisattva enters this door: seeing all pure and fine Buddha-lands, he does not delight, does not covet, and does not become arrogant. Seeing all impure Buddha-lands, he does not grieve, is not obstructed/vexed, and does not sink down. He merely generates a pure mind towards the Buddhas, rejoicing and respectful, thinking 'Unprecedented!'

"The merit of the Buddhas and Tathāgatas is equal. In order to convert sentient beings, they manifest different Buddha-lands. Ānanda! You see the lands of the Buddhas; the ground has various differences, but the empty space has no various differences. Like this, although you see the color-bodies of the Buddhas have various differences, their unobstructed wisdom has no various differences."

## The Dharma of Exhaustible and Inexhaustible

At that time, the bodhisattvas from the Accumulated Fragrance world put their palms together and said to the Buddha: "World Honored One! When we first saw this land, we generated the thought of inferiority. Now we repent and blame ourselves, abandoning this mind. Why? The skillful means (*upāya*) of the Buddhas are inconceivable. In order to save sentient beings, they manifest different Buddha-countries according to what is appropriate. O World Honored One! We wish you to bestow a little Dharma [on us], so that when we return to that land we may remember the Tathāgata."

The Buddha told those bodhisattvas: "There is the liberation Dharma-door of the **Exhaustible** and **Inexhaustible** (*kṣayākṣaya-vimokṣa*). You should learn this.

"What is meant by **Exhaustible**? It means **Conditioned Dharmas** (*saṃskṛta*).
"What is meant by **Inexhaustible**? It means **Unconditioned Dharmas** (*asaṃskṛta*).
"The Bodhisattva does not exhaust the Conditioned, and does not dwell in the Unconditioned.

### Not Exhausting the Conditioned (The Bodhisattva's Engagement)

"What does it mean not to exhaust the Conditioned? It means:
*   Not separating from Great Kindness (*mahā-maitrī*), not abandoning Great Compassion (*mahā-karuṇā*).
*   Deeply generating the mind of Omniscience (*sarvajña*) and not forgetting it.
*   Teaching and converting sentient beings without ever growing weary.
*   Constantly being mindful of and practicing the Four Means of Attraction.
*   Protecting and upholding the True Dharma without sparing body or life.
*   Planting all roots of goodness without fatigue or disgust.
*   Will constantly abiding in the transfer of merit through skillful means.
*   Seeking Dharma without laziness, speaking Dharma without stinginess.
*   Deliberately entering birth-and-death (*samsara*) without fear.
*   Regarding all glory and disgrace with a mind free of worry or joy.
*   Not despising the unlearned, but respecting the learned as if they were Buddhas.
*   Causing those fallen into affliction to generate correct mindfulness.
*   Not valuing the joy of isolation/detachment; not attaching to one's own joy, but celebrating the joy of others.
*   While in the dhyānas, thinking of them as [suffering like] hell.²
*   While in birth-and-death, thinking of it as a garden/park.³
*   Seeing those who come seeking [help] and thinking of them as good teachers.
*   Giving up all possessions and thinking of it as possessing Omniscience.
*   Seeing those who break precepts and generating thoughts of salvation/protection.
*   Thinking of the Pāramitās as parents.
*   Thinking of the factors of the Way (*bodhipakṣika-dharma*) as relatives/retinue.
*   Practicing limitless giving to adorn one's own Buddha-land.
*   Using the sword of wisdom to destroy the thieves of affliction.
*   Using great vigor to subdue the armies of Māra.
*   Constantly seeking the wisdom of the thought-less Reality (*animitta-bhūtatā*).
*   Having few desires and knowing satisfaction regarding worldly dharmas.
*   Seeking supramundane dharmas without satisfaction.
*   Not abandoning worldly dharmas, yet not violating the rules of deportment.
*   Using supernatural wisdom (*abhijñā*) to guide sentient beings.
*   Remembering all hearing [of Dharma] without forgetting.

"Practicing such dharmas is called the Bodhisattva not exhausting the Conditioned."

### Not Dwelling in the Unconditioned (The Bodhisattva's Detachment)

"What does it mean that the Bodhisattva does not dwell in the Unconditioned?
*   He cultivates the learning of Emptiness, yet does not take Emptiness as a realization/witness (*sākṣāt-kriyā*).
*   He cultivates Signlessness and Wishlessness, yet does not take them as valid realization.
*   He cultivates Non-Arising, yet does not take Non-Arising as realization.
*   He observes Impermanence, yet does not weary of the roots of goodness.
*   He observes the Suffering of the world, yet does not hate birth-and-death.
*   He observes No-Self, yet instructs people tirelessly.
*   He observes Tranquil Extinction (*vyupaśama*), yet does not become eternally extinct.
*   He observes Distancing/Isolation, yet cultivates the good in body and mind.
*   He observes No-Return, yet returns to orient towards Good Dharmas.
*   He observes Unconditioned, yet does not cut off the connection to Conditioned Dharmas.
*   He observes the position of the True Dharma,⁴ yet does not follow the Hīnayāna.

"Because he is endowed with merit, he does not dwell in the Unconditioned. Because he is endowed with wisdom, he does not exhaust the Conditioned.
"Because of Great Kindness and Compassion, he does not dwell in the Unconditioned. Because he fulfills his original vows, he does not exhaust the Conditioned.
"Because he gathers the Dharma-medicine, he does not dwell in the Unconditioned. Because he dispenses medicine according to [needs], he does not exhaust the Conditioned.
"Because he knows the sicknesses of sentient beings, he does not dwell in the Unconditioned. Because he cures the sicknesses of sentient beings, he does not exhaust the Conditioned.

"Virtuous Ones! The Bodhisattva who cultivates this Dharma does not exhaust the Conditioned and does not dwell in the Unconditioned. This is called the Exhaustible-Inexhaustible Liberation Dharma-door. You should learn this."

## Return of the Bodhisattvas

At that time, those [Accumulated Fragrance] Bodhisattvas, hearing this Dharma, were all greatly delighted. They scattered various fine flowers of different colors and scents throughout the Triple Thousand Great Thousand World, making offerings to the Buddha, this Sutra-Dharma, and the Bodhisattvas. They bowed at the Buddha's feet, praised it as unprecedented, and said: "The Śākyamuni Buddha is indeed able to perform good skillful means in this place."

Having spoken thus, they suddenly disappeared and returned to that country.

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Footnotes

1.  **Right palm**: Vimalakirti shrinks the massive assembly into his hand. This plays with the spatial relativity introduced in earlier chapters.
2.  **Thinking of dhyānas as hell**: A shocking statement aimed at preventing attachment to meditative bliss (*dhyāna-sukha*). For a Bodhisattva, getting stuck in a trance is as bad as being in hell because it prevents serving others.
3.  **Thinking of birth-and-death as a garden**: *Samsara* is not a prison to escape, but a playground for saving beings. This is the definition of "Playful Samādhi" (*vikrīḍita*).
4.  **Position of the True Dharma**: *Nyāma*. Usually refers to the irreversible state of the Arhat. The Bodhisattva stands on the brink of this "extinction" but refuses to fall into it.

### Concepts

*   **Exhaustible (Kṣaya)**: Refers to *saṃskṛta* (conditioned existence, samsara, building karma/merit).
*   **Inexhaustible (Akṣaya)**: Refers to *asaṃskṛta* (unconditioned, nirvana, emptiness).
*   **The Middle Way**: The standard Hīnayāna goal is to "exhaust" the conditioned and "enter" the unconditioned. The Mahāyāna goal is to keep the conditioned running (to generate merit/save beings) while having the wisdom of the unconditioned (to not be trapped). This dynamic tension is the heart of the "Bodhisattva Practice."
