## Śāriputra's Concern

At that time, Śāriputra saw that this room had no seats¹ and thought: "Where will all these bodhisattvas and great disciples sit?"

The elder Vimalakirti, knowing his thought, said to Śāriputra: "Well, Venerable! Have you come for the Dharma or have you come for a seat?"²

Śāriputra said: "I have come for the Dharma, not for a seat."

Vimalakirti said: "Ah, Śāriputra! One who seeks the Dharma does not crave even for body and life, much less for a seat!³ One who seeks the Dharma does not seek in form, sensation, perception, volition, or consciousness.⁴ He does not seek in the realms or sense-fields. He does not seek in the desire realm, form realm, or formless realm.

"Ah, Śāriputra! One who seeks the Dharma is not attached to seeking the Buddha, not attached to seeking the Dharma, not attached to seeking the Saṅgha.⁵ One who seeks the Dharma has no view of suffering to see, no view of the origin to cut off, no view of cessation to realize or verify, no view of the path to cultivate.⁶ Why is this? The Dharma is beyond conceptual elaboration.⁷ If one says, 'I shall see suffering, cut off the origin, realize cessation, and cultivate the path,' this is conceptual elaboration, not seeking the Dharma.

"Ah, Śāriputra! The Dharma is named 'extinction.'⁸ If one practices arising and ceasing, this is seeking arising and ceasing, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma is named 'unstained.'⁹ If one is stained by dharmas up to nirvāṇa, this is stainedness, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma is without 'place of action.'¹⁰ If one acts in the Dharma, this is a place of action, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma is without taking or rejecting.¹¹ If one takes or rejects dharmas, this is taking and rejecting, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma is without location.¹² If one is attached to location, this is attachment to location, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma is named 'signless.'¹³ If one follows signs for cognition, this is seeking signs, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma cannot be dwelt in.¹⁴ If one dwells in the Dharma, this is dwelling in the Dharma, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma cannot be seen, heard, felt, or known.¹⁵ If one practices seeing, hearing, feeling, or knowing, this is seeing, hearing, feeling, or knowing—not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma is named 'unconditioned.'¹⁶ If one practices the conditioned, this is seeking the conditioned, not seeking the Dharma.

"Therefore, Śāriputra! One who seeks the Dharma should have no seeking whatsoever toward any dharma."¹⁷

When these words were spoken, five hundred devas attained the pure Dharma-eye¹⁸ with regard to all dharmas.

## The Miraculous Seats

At that time, the elder Vimalakirti asked Mañjuśrī: "Venerable One! In your journeys through immeasurable thousands of myriads of billions of asaṅkhyeya lands,¹⁹ which buddha-land has the finest and most wonderful lion seats accomplished with supreme merit?"

Mañjuśrī said: "Householder! To the east, past thirty-six times the number of sands in the Ganges,²⁰ there is a world called Sumeru-Form. Its buddha is named Sumeru-Lamp-King, presently manifesting there. That buddha's body is eighty-four thousand yojanas tall.²¹ His lion seat is eighty-four thousand yojanas high, magnificently adorned beyond compare."

Thereupon, the elder Vimalakirti manifested his spiritual powers.²² Immediately, that buddha dispatched thirty-two thousand lion seats, lofty, vast, magnificently pure, which entered Vimalakirti's room. The bodhisattvas, great disciples, Śakra, Brahmā, and the Four Heavenly Kings had never seen such a thing before.²³

The room was vast enough to fully accommodate all thirty-two thousand lion seats without any obstruction.²⁴ The city of Vaiśālī, Jambudvīpa, and the four continents were not pressed or crowded—everything appeared as before.

## The Miracle of the Small and Large

At that time, Vimalakirti said to Mañjuśrī: "Please take a lion seat! Together with all the bodhisattvas and superior beings, be seated. You should make your body conform to the size of that seat."²⁵

Those bodhisattvas who had attained spiritual powers immediately transformed their bodies to forty-two thousand yojanas and sat on the lion seats.²⁶ But the newly-aspired bodhisattvas and great disciples could not ascend.

Then Vimalakirti said to Śāriputra: "Take a lion seat!"

Śāriputra said: "Householder! This seat is high and vast—I cannot ascend it."²⁷

Vimalakirti said: "Ah, Śāriputra! Make obeisance to the Tathāgata Sumeru-Lamp-King, and then you will be able to sit."²⁸

Thereupon, the newly-aspired bodhisattvas and great disciples made obeisance to the Tathāgata Sumeru-Lamp-King, and were then able to sit on the lion seats.

## The Inconceivable Liberation

Śāriputra said: "Householder! How unprecedented! Such a small room can contain these lofty and vast seats!²⁹ The city of Vaiśālī is not obstructed. Nor are the villages and cities of Jambudvīpa, the four continents, the palaces of the devas, dragon-kings, and spirits pressed or crowded."

Vimalakirti said: "Ah, Śāriputra! For the buddhas and bodhisattvas, there is a liberation called 'Inconceivable.'³⁰ If a bodhisattva abides in this liberation, he can place the height and vastness of Mount Sumeru within a mustard seed,³¹ with no increase or decrease. Mount Sumeru, King of Mountains, remains in its original form. The Four Heavenly Kings and the gods of Trāyastriṃśa³² are not aware of having entered it—only those fit to be liberated see Sumeru enter the mustard seed. This is called abiding in the Dharma-gate of Inconceivable Liberation.³³

"Furthermore, he can place the waters of the four great oceans within a single pore³⁴ without disturbing the fish, turtles, sea-monsters, or other water-creatures. Those great oceans remain in their original form. The dragons, spirits, and asuras are not aware of having entered it—nor are any of those beings harmed.

"Furthermore, Śāriputra! A bodhisattva abiding in the Inconceivable Liberation can take the great thousand-fold world,³⁵ as if picking up a potter's wheel, and place it in his right palm.³⁶ He can throw it past worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, and the beings within it are not aware of having come or gone. He then returns it to its original place, and no one thinks they have traveled—yet the world remains as before.

"Furthermore, Śāriputra! If there are beings who delight in long life and can be liberated thereby, the bodhisattva can extend seven days to become an aeon,³⁷ and those beings will consider it an aeon. Or if there are beings who do not delight in long life and can be liberated thereby, the bodhisattva can compress an aeon into seven days,³⁸ and those beings will consider it seven days.

"Furthermore, Śāriputra! A bodhisattva abiding in the Inconceivable Liberation can gather the adornments of all buddha-lands into a single land³⁹ and display them to sentient beings. Furthermore, the bodhisattva can take all sentient beings of a buddha-land, place them in his right palm, and fly to the ten directions,⁴⁰ showing all while not moving from the original place.

"Furthermore, Śāriputra! All the offerings that beings of the ten directions make to the buddhas can be seen in a single pore.⁴¹ The suns, moons, and stars of all lands of the ten directions can be seen in a single pore.

"Furthermore, Śāriputra! All the winds of the ten directions can be drawn into the bodhisattva's mouth⁴² without harming his body, and the trees outside are not snapped. When the great thousand-fold world is consumed by fire at the end of an aeon, the bodhisattva can draw all the fire into his belly,⁴³ and the fire continues to burn but does him no harm.

"Furthermore, past worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges below, he can take up a buddha-land and raise it past worlds as numerous as sands of the Ganges above—as if lifting a jujube leaf on a needle-point—and no beings are harmed.⁴⁴

"Furthermore, Śāriputra! A bodhisattva abiding in the Inconceivable Liberation can manifest through spiritual powers the body of a buddha, the body of a pratyekabuddha, the body of a śrāvaka, the body of Śakra, the body of Brahmā, the body of a world-lord, or the body of a wheel-turning king.⁴⁵

"Furthermore, all sounds—high, middle, and low—of beings in the ten directions can be transformed into the Buddha's voice,⁴⁶ expounding the sounds of impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and non-self, as well as the various teachings spoken by the buddhas of the ten directions. All can be heard universally within them.

"Śāriputra! I have now briefly spoken of the power of the bodhisattva's Inconceivable Liberation. If I were to speak of it extensively, I would not finish even in an aeon."⁴⁷

## Mahākāśyapa's Response

At that time, Mahākāśyapa, having heard this teaching of the bodhisattva's Inconceivable Liberation Dharma-gate,⁴⁸ sighed in wonder and said to Śāriputra: "It is like displaying various colors before a blind person—they cannot see them.⁴⁹ Thus, when all śrāvakas hear this Dharma-gate of the Inconceivable Liberation, they cannot understand it.

"When the wise hear this, who would not arouse the aspiration for *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*?⁵⁰ We have permanently cut off our roots with regard to this Great Vehicle—we are like spoiled seeds!⁵¹ All śrāvakas who hear this Dharma-gate of the Inconceivable Liberation should weep and wail, their voices shaking the great thousand-fold world.⁵²

"All bodhisattvas should greatly rejoice and receive this Dharma on the crown of their heads.⁵³ If there is a bodhisattva who faithfully understands this Dharma-gate of the Inconceivable Liberation, all the hosts of Māra can do nothing to him."

When Mahākāśyapa spoke these words, thirty-two thousand devas all aroused the aspiration for *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*.⁵⁴

## Māra as Teacher

At that time, Vimalakirti said to Mahākāśyapa: "Venerable One! In immeasurable asaṅkhyeya worlds of the ten directions, those who act as māra-kings are mostly bodhisattvas abiding in the Inconceivable Liberation.⁵⁵ Through the power of skillful means, they educate sentient beings by manifesting as māra-kings.

"Furthermore, Kāśyapa! In immeasurable lands of the ten directions, there are bodhisattvas from whom people beg hands, feet, ears, noses, heads, eyes, marrow, brains, blood, flesh, skin, bones, villages, cities, wives, children, servants, elephants, horses, carriages, gold, silver, lapis lazuli, mother-of-pearl, agate, coral, amber, pearls, shells, clothing, and food.⁵⁶ Most of these beggars are bodhisattvas abiding in the Inconceivable Liberation who, through the power of skillful means, test and strengthen other bodhisattvas.⁵⁷

"Why is this? Bodhisattvas abiding in the Inconceivable Liberation have the power of majestic virtue,⁵⁸ and so they manifest such pressing trials, showing sentient beings these difficult things. Ordinary beings with inferior power cannot in this way press bodhisattvas.⁵⁹

"It is like the trampling of a dragon-elephant—an ass cannot bear it.⁶⁰ This is called the gate of wisdom and skillful means of bodhisattvas abiding in the Inconceivable Liberation."
