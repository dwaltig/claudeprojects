# Chapter 5: Manjushri Comes Calling (文殊師利問疾品)

**Blues Translation by Master John Kim**

---

## The Buddha Sends His Best

Now the Blessed One turned to Manjushri—the sharpest mind in the whole assembly—and said, "You go check on Vimalakirti. See how he's doing."

Manjushri bowed and said, "Lord, that man is something else.¹ He's got wisdom that goes all the way down. His tongue's like lightning and his mind don't miss nothing. He knows every trick in the bodhisattva book and he's been to every corner of the Buddha's treasury. He's whipped every demon that ever came at him and he plays with powers like a child plays with toys.² 

"But alright. If you say go, I'm going."

---

## Everybody Wants to See This

Word spread fast. Every bodhisattva, every elder disciple, every god and spirit in that assembly thought the same thing: *These two titans are about to throw down. This gonna be good.*

Eight thousand bodhisattvas. Five hundred monks who'd heard the truth. Hundreds of thousands of heavenly beings. They all fell in behind Manjushri like a parade heading into Vaishali.

---

## The Empty Room

Now Vimalakirti, he knew they were coming.³ So what'd he do? He cleared out his whole room. Gone. Every chair, every table, every servant—vanished. Just him lying on a single bed, looking pitiful.

When Manjushri walked in, he saw nothing but empty space and one old man playing sick.⁴

Vimalakirti smiled and said, "Well, well! Welcome, Manjushri! You come here without coming. You see me without seeing."⁵

Manjushri didn't miss a beat. "That's right, old man. What's come has already come; what's gone has already gone. There's nowhere to come from and nowhere to go to. But let's set all that aside. The Buddha sent me to ask: How you feeling? That sickness getting better or worse? What started it and how we gonna end it?"

---

## The Only Sickness That Matters

Vimalakirti sat up a little and said, "You want to know where this sickness comes from?⁶ I'll tell you straight.

"It comes from loving too much. See, every living being out there is sick—sick with ignorance, sick with craving, sick with fear.⁷ And because they're sick, I'm sick. If they got healed? I'd be healed too.

"It's like a mama and her only child.⁸ When that child gets sick, mama gets sick. When that child gets well, mama gets well. That's how a bodhisattva loves every being in the universe—like his own child.

"You asked what caused this illness? One word: *compassion*."⁹

---

## The Deepest Blues

Manjushri looked around the bare room. "Why you got no help here? No attendants? Nothing?"

Vimalakirti said, "Because every Buddha-land is just as empty."¹⁰

"Empty how?"

"Empty by emptiness."

"What good is emptiness?"

"It's good because there's nothing to divide up. No this, no that."

"Can you divide emptiness?"

"The dividing is empty too."¹¹

"Where do you find this emptiness?"

"Look in the sixty-two wrong views."¹²

"Where do you find those wrong views?"

"In the liberation of all Buddhas."

"Where's that liberation found?"

"Right in the minds of all suffering beings."¹³

Vimalakirti grinned. "You asked why I got no attendants? Let me tell you: every demon, every heretic—they're all my servants.¹⁴ Demons love staying stuck in birth and death? Well, the bodhisattva stays there too, but different. Heretics love their crazy ideas? The bodhisattva can walk through those ideas without getting scratched."¹⁵

---

## What Kind of Sickness Is This?

Manjushri asked, "This sickness of yours—what's it look like?"

"Can't see it. Got no shape."¹⁶

"Is it in your body or your mind?"

"Neither. The body falls apart anyway—that's its nature.¹⁷ And the mind? The mind's like a magic trick."

"Alright then. Earth, water, fire, wind—which element's making you sick?"

"None of them and all of them.¹⁸ Beings get sick because they got bodies made of these elements. Because they're sick, I'm sick."

---

## How to Comfort a Sick Saint

Manjushri said, "So tell me—how's a bodhisattva supposed to comfort another bodhisattva who's suffering?"

Vimalakirti leaned forward. "You tell him the body don't last—but you don't make him hate his body.¹⁹ You tell him the body suffers—but you don't make him run to nirvana. You tell him there's no self in the body—but you still teach him to help people.²⁰ You tell him the body's empty—but you don't say everything ends in nothing.

"You tell him to repent his old mistakes—but you don't dwell in the past. You feel your own pain and let it open your heart to everybody else's pain.²¹ You remember how long you been hurting and you use that to help others. You stay vigorous. Stay strong. Don't give up.

"Be a healer.²² Cure every sickness you see. That's how you lift up a suffering bodhisattva and make him glad."

---

## Getting Your Mind Right

Manjushri said, "How's a sick bodhisattva supposed to deal with his own mind?"

Vimalakirti lay back and said, "Like this:²³

"He thinks: 'This sickness I got—it comes from old delusions, old cravings, old confusion. There ain't nothing real about it. Who's sick, anyway? This body's just four elements pretending to be one thing.²⁴ Those elements got no owner. This body got no self.

"'This sickness comes from grabbing at "I" and "mine." So let go of that grabbing.'²⁵

"Once you see the root, you stop thinking about yourself as a self. You stop thinking about others as selves too. Then you think about dharmas—just causes and conditions coming together.²⁶ 'This body ain't nothing but patterns. When they arise, just arising. When they fade, just fading. The patterns don't know each other. Nothing says "I'm arising." Nothing says "I'm dying."'

"Then you let go of dharma-thinking too.²⁷ Because even seeing things as dharmas is still a kind of holding on. And holding on is the sickness! So you let that go.

"What's letting go? Letting go of you and yours. How? Stop dividing inside from outside.²⁸ Live in what's equal.

"'Equal' means: the self is empty. Nirvana is empty. They're the same kind of empty—empty in name only.²⁹ When you get this equality, you got no more sickness, except the sickness of emptiness. And that sickness is empty too.

"The sick bodhisattva accepts everything without grasping. He ain't finished his work yet, so he don't check out early."³⁰

---

## Wisdom and Hustle

"When your body hurts, think about beings in the hellish realms.³¹ Let that grow your compassion. Say to yourself: 'If I can tame me, I can help tame them.' Take away their sickness, but don't take away the medicine.³²

"Cut the root of sickness. What's the root? Craving and clinging.³³ What are you craving? This whole three-world casino.³⁴ How do you cut it? By not grasping. If you don't grasp, you don't crave.

"What's 'not grasping'? It's dropping the two views—looking inside, looking outside.³⁵ Drop both. That's freedom.

"Manjushri, that's how the sick bodhisattva works his mind. That's how he ends old age, sickness, and death.³⁶ That's what we call waking up. If he don't do it this way, all his practice is useless. Like a man who thinks he won the fight but never even threw a punch.³⁷

"The one who really defeats old age, sickness, and death? *That's* a bodhisattva."

---

## What Ties You Up, What Sets You Free

Vimalakirti kept going. "The sick bodhisattva should think: 'This sickness of mine ain't real or solid. Everybody's sickness is the same—not real, not solid.'³⁸

"But when you see beings suffering and your heart breaks with love? Check that love. If it's got craving mixed in, if it's got views attached—let it go.³⁹ That kind of compassion will wear you out. You'll get tired of birth and death. But pure compassion? It never gets tired. Wherever you're born, you're not trapped. You can teach freedom because you are free.

"Buddha said it plain: 'You're tied up yourself? You can't untie nobody else. But if you're free? You can set the whole world loose.'⁴⁰

"So don't get tied up.

"What ties you up? Loving the taste of meditation too much.⁴¹ Getting drunk on the quiet.

"What sets you free? Skillful action born from wisdom.⁴²

"Wisdom without skill? Bondage.⁴³ Skill with wisdom? Liberation.
"Skill without wisdom? Bondage. Wisdom with skill? Liberation.

"You building Buddha-lands with craving in your heart? That's bondage.⁴⁴ You building Buddha-lands with a clear mind? That's freedom.

"You planting virtue while you're still tangled up in desire and anger? That's bondage.⁴⁵ You planting virtue after you've cleaned house? And dedicating it to the highest awakening? That's freedom."

## Walking the Razor's Edge

"The bodhisattva looks at his body and sees: impermanent, suffering, empty, not-self.⁴⁶ That's wisdom.

"But he stays in birth and death anyway, helping everybody, never giving up.⁴⁷ That's skill.

"He sees the body doesn't leave illness and illness doesn't leave the body.⁴⁸ They're not new and not old. That's wisdom.

"And he keeps living, keeps serving, keeps showing up. That's skill.

"Manjushri, the bodhisattva works his mind this way. He don't rest in 'tamed' and he don't rest in 'wild.'⁴⁹ Resting in wild is what fools do. Resting in tamed is what the small-path folks do.⁵⁰ The bodhisattva don't rest either place. He walks between.

"He lives in birth and death without getting dirty.⁵¹ He abides in nirvana without going extinct. Not ordinary, not holy. Not stained, not pure.⁵²

"He might look like he's doing demon-work—but he's putting demons in their place.⁵³ He seeks all-knowledge, but never at the wrong time. He sees all dharmas as unborn, but he don't slip into the final rest.⁵⁴ He walks through the twisted views like they're nothing.⁵⁵

"He gathers all beings without clinging. He loves solitude but he don't annihilate body and mind. He moves through the three realms without breaking the true nature. He practices emptiness while planting good seeds.⁵⁶ He practices signlessness while saving beings. He practices wishlessness while taking on a body.

"He practices non-arising while doing good. He practices the six perfections while reading every mind. He practices the six powers while staying engaged.⁵⁷

"He touches the four immeasurable hearts without craving heaven. He enters deep meditation without getting stuck there.⁵⁸ He practices mindfulness without leaving body, feeling, mind, or dharma behind. He makes right effort without exhausting himself. He develops the powers while knowing what's sharp and what's dull.

"He walks the Eightfold Path, but his path has no limits.⁵⁹ He practices calm and insight without falling into final peace. He embodies non-arising and non-ceasing, yet he shows up with all the marks of beauty.⁶⁰ He might look like a śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha, but he never abandons the Big Way.

"He follows the pure nature of all things, yet he appears in whatever form is needed.⁶¹ He sees every buddha-land as empty as space, yet he manifests pure lands without end. He wins buddhahood, turns the wheel, enters nirvana—and he never leaves the bodhisattva path."⁶²

## The Payoff

When Vimalakirti finished speaking, eight thousand heavenly beings in that assembly woke up.⁶³ Right there, in that bare room, listening to one old man talk about sickness and freedom—they felt it rise in them: the wish to become buddhas themselves.

*That's* what happens when two masters of the Way start throwing truth at each other.

## Endnotes: Blues to Buddhist Bridges

**Theological Note**: This chapter is the heart of the sutra—the meeting of Wisdom (Mañjuśrī) and Skillful Means (Vimalakirti). Their dialogue demolishes every dualism: sick/well, bound/free, arising/ceasing, wisdom/action. The "illness" becomes the teaching. As the Blues says: "The very thing that cuts you is the thing that heals you."
