## Viewing the Tathāgata

At that time, the World Honored One asked Vimalakirti: "You wish to see the Tathāgata. How do you view the Tathāgata?"

Vimalakirti said: "Just as I view the true characteristic (*bhūta-lakṣaṇa*) of my own body, so I view the Buddha.
"I view the Tathāgata as not coming from the past, not going to the future, and not abiding in the present.
"I do not view form (*rūpa*), nor the suchness of form, nor the nature of form.
"I do not view feeling, perception, formation, or consciousness; nor the suchness of consciousness, nor the nature of consciousness.
"He does not arise from the four great elements (*mahābhūta*); he is the same as empty space.
"He has no accumulation of the six entrances (*āyatana*); eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind have already passed.
"He is not in the Three Realms (*triloka*); the three defilements are already separated.
"He accords with the Three Gates of Liberation (*vimokṣa-mukha*).
"He possesses the Three Illuminations (*vidyā*), yet is equal to ignorance (*avidyā*).¹
"He is not a unitary characteristic, not a different characteristic. Not a self-characteristic, not an other-characteristic. Not without characteristic, not grasping characteristic.
"Not this shore, not the other shore, not the middle flow—yet he converts sentient beings.
"I view him in tranquil extinction (*nirvana*), yet he is not eternally extinct.
"Not this, not that; not by means of this, not by means of that.
"He cannot be known by intellect (*jñāna*), cannot be recognized by consciousness (*vijñāna*).
"No obscurity, no brightness. No name, no sign. No strength, no weakness. Neither pure nor defiled.
"Not in a place, not apart from a place. Neither conditioned (*saṃskṛta*) nor unconditioned (*asaṃskṛta*). No demonstrating, no speaking.
"Not giving, not stinging. Not precept-keeping, not violating. Not patient, not angry. Not energetic, not lazy. Not concentrated, not scattered. Not wise, not foolish. Not sincere, not deceptive.
"No coming, no going. No exiting, no entering. All paths of language are cut off.
"He is not a field of merit (*puṇyakṣetra*), nor is he not a field of merit. He is not worthy of offerings, nor is he not worthy of offerings.²
"Neither grasping nor abandoning. Neither having characteristics nor lacking characteristics.
"He is the same as the True Limit (*bhūtakoṭi*), equal to the Dharma-Nature (*dharmatā*).
"He cannot be weighed, cannot be measured; he surpasses all weighing and measuring.
"Neither large nor small. Neither seeing nor hearing, neither feeling nor knowing. Separated from all knots and bonds.
"Equal to all wisdoms, same as all sentient beings, having no discrimination regarding all dharmas.
"Everything without loss, without turbidity, without distress, without doing, without arising, without birth, without extinction.
"No fear, no worry, no joy, no disgust, no attachment.
"No existence in the past, no existence in the future, no existence in the present.
"He cannot be displayed by any distinct speech.
"World Honored One! The body of the Tathāgata is like this. To perform such a viewing is called Correct Viewing (*samyag-darśana*). If one views otherwise, it is called Deviant Viewing."

## Origin of Vimalakirti

At that time, Śāriputra asked Vimalakirti: "Where did you die to come be born here?"

Vimalakirti said: "Does the Dharma you have attained have death and birth?"

Śāriputra said: "There is no death or birth."

"If all dharmas have no characteristic of death or birth, why do you ask: 'Where did you die to come be born here?' What do you think? It is like a magician who conjures an illusion of a man or woman—do they die and are they born?"

Śāriputra said: "There is no death or birth."

"Have you not heard the Buddha say that all dharmas are like illusion-characteristics?"

"Yes."

"If all dharmas are like illusion-characteristics, why do you ask: 'Where did you die to come be born here?' Śāriputra! 'Death' is a method of emptiness and deception, a characteristic of decay. 'Birth' is a method of emptiness and deception, a characteristic of continuity. Although the Bodhisattva dies, he does not exhaust his roots of goodness. Although he is born, he does not nurture evils."

At that time, the Buddha told Śāriputra: "There is a country called **Wonderful Joy** (*Abhirati*). The Buddha is named **Akshobhya** (Immovable). Vimalakirti died in that country and came to be born here."

Śāriputra said: "Unprecedented! World Honored One! This person is able to abandon a pure land (*sukhāvatī*) and come to delight in this place of much anger and harm."

Vimalakirti said to Śāriputra: "What do you think? When the sunlight comes out, does it unite with the darkness?"

"No. When the sunlight comes out, the darkness is gone."

Vimalakirti said: "Why does the sun travel to Jambudvīpa (the Human World)?"

"It wishes to illuminate it with brightness, to remove the darkness for its sake."

Vimalakirti said: "The Bodhisattva is like this. Although he is born in an impure Buddha-land, it is for the sake of converting sentient beings, therefore he does not unite with the darkness of ignorance. He merely destroys the darkness of the sentient beings' afflictions!"

## The Immovable Buddha

At that time, the great assembly thirstily admired (*tṛṣṇā-adhimukti*), wishing to see the World of Wonderful Joy, the Tathāgata Akshobhya, and his multitude of bodhisattvas and śrāvakas.

The Buddha, knowing the thoughts of the entire assembly, said to Vimalakirti: "Good man! For the sake of this assembly, manifest the World of Wonderful Joy, the Tathāgata Akshobhya, and the bodhisattvas and śrāvakas. Everyone wishes to see them."

Then Vimalakirti thought: "I should, without rising from my seat, take the World of Wonderful Joy—with its Iron Ring Mountains, rivers, valleys, streams, oceans, springs, Mount Sumeru, sun, moon, stars, palaces of gods, dragons, spirits, and Brahma; together with the multitude of bodhisattvas and śrāvakas, the cities, towns, villages, men and women, big and small; even up to the Tathāgata Akshobhya, the Bodhi tree, and the wonderful lotus flowers—everything that performs Buddha-work in the ten directions.
"I shall maintain the three jeweled stairways from Jambudvīpa to the Tuṣita Heaven... I shall sever it with my right hand like a potter's wheel, bring it into this world, holding it like a garland of flowers, and show it to all the multitudes."

Thinking thus, he entered samādhi and manifested supernatural power. With his right hand, he severed the World of Wonderful Joy and placed it in this land.

Those bodhisattvas and śrāvakas [in Abhirati] who had obtained supernatural powers, along with other gods and humans, all cried out: "World Honored One! Who is taking me away? We wish for rescue and protection!"

The Buddha Akshobhya said: "It is not my doing. It is the doing of Vimalakirti's supernatural power." The others who had not obtained supernatural powers did not even perceive or know where they were going. Although the World of Wonderful Joy entered this land, it did not increase or decrease [in size], and this [Saha] world was not crowded or cramped; it was just as before.

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha told the great assembly: "You should look closely at the World of Wonderful Joy, the Tathāgata Akshobhya, the adornments of his country, the pure conduct of the bodhisattvas, and the purity of the disciples."

They all said: "Yes, indeed, we have seen it."

The Buddha said: "If a bodhisattva wishes to obtain a pure Buddha-land like this, he should learn the path practiced by the Tathāgata Akshobhya."

When this World of Wonderful Joy appeared, 14 nayutas of people in the Saha world generated the mind of *Anuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi*, all vowing to be born in the World of Wonderful Joy. Śākyamuni Buddha immediately prophesied (*vyākaraṇa*): "You shall be born in that country."

Then, the World of Wonderful Joy, having finished its work of benefit in this land, returned to its original place. The whole assembly saw it.

### Footnotes

1.  **Equal to ignorance**: A radical non-dual statement. Enlightenment (*vidyā*) and ignorance (*avidyā*) are same in their ultimate nature (emptiness). If one sees them as different, one is still in duality.
2.  **Field of merit**: *Puṇyakṣetra*. Usually refers to Buddhas or Arhats; giving to them generates vast merit. Vimalakirti deconstructs this: the Buddha is beyond the duality of "worthy" or "unworthy."

### Concepts

*   **Akshobhya (Immovable)**: One of the oldest Buddhas in the Mahāyāna pantheon (often paired with Amitābha). His land, Abhirati (Wonderful Joy), represents the East. He strictly observes the monastic code and represents unshakeable determination.
*   **Abhirati vs. Sukhāvatī**: Unlike Amitābha's Western Paradise (which is easy to enter via faith), Akshobhya's Eastern Paradise requires strict morality and non-anger. It is "realist"—women there are still women (unlike in Sukhāvatī where they become men) but suffer no pain of childbirth.
*   **Potter's Wheel**: A common Indian metaphor for ease of rotation. Vimalakirti spins a galaxy as easily as a potter spins a wheel.
