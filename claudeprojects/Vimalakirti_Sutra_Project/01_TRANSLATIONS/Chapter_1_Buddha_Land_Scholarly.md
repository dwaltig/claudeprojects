## Opening Formula

Thus have I heard:¹

At one time, the Buddha was dwelling in the Āmrapālī Garden² near Vaiśālī,³ together with a great assembly of eight thousand bhikṣus⁴ and thirty-two thousand bodhisattvas⁵—all well-known, possessing great wisdom and fundamental practice, all having attained accomplishment. They had been established by the awesome spiritual power of all buddhas, served as protectors of the Dharma-citadel, and upheld the true Dharma. They could roar the lion's roar,⁶ their names renowned throughout the ten directions. Without being asked, they befriended and comforted beings. They continued and exalted the Three Jewels,⁷ enabling them never to be cut off. They had subdued Māra⁸ and his adversaries, controlled all heterodox teachers, and were completely pure, forever free from the hindrances and entanglements.⁹ Their minds constantly abided in unobstructed liberation.¹⁰ Their mindfulness, concentration, dhāraṇī,¹¹ and eloquence were uninterrupted. Giving, moral discipline, patience, vigor, meditation, wisdom, and skillful means¹²—all these powers they possessed completely. They had attained the patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas.¹³ They were already able to accord with and turn the irreversible wheel.¹⁴ They skillfully understood the characteristics of dharmas and knew the faculties of sentient beings. They covered the great assembly with fearlessness, merit, and wisdom, cultivating their minds thereby. The marks and secondary characteristics¹⁵ adorned their bodies, their physical appearance supreme. They had renounced all worldly adornments. Their fame and reputation were lofty and far-reaching, surpassing Mount Sumeru.¹⁶ Their deep faith was firm, like vajra.¹⁷ The Dharma-jewel universally illuminated, raining down sweet dew.¹⁸ Among all voices, theirs were the most subtle and wonderful. They had deeply entered dependent origination¹⁹ and severed all wrong views—the two extremes of existence and non-existence²⁰—without any residual habits. They expounded the Dharma fearlessly, like the lion's roar. Their discourses were like thunder. Measureless, they had transcended all measure. Gathering all Dharma-jewels, like ocean-navigating captains, they thoroughly understood the profound and subtle meaning of all dharmas. They well knew the comings and goings of sentient beings and what their minds were engaged in. They were close to the unequaled, equal Buddha's sovereign wisdom, the ten powers, the fearlessnesses, and the eighteen unique qualities.²¹ They closed the gates to all evil destinies, yet manifested their bodies in the five paths of existence.²² They were great physician-kings, skillfully healing all diseases, prescribing medicine according to illness, causing beings to take and practice it. Immeasurable merit they had accomplished; immeasurable buddha-lands they had purified. Those who saw or heard them all received benefit; whatever they did was never in vain. All such merits they possessed completely.

Their names were: Bodhisattva Equal Vision, Bodhisattva Unequal Vision, Bodhisattva Equal-Unequal Vision, Bodhisattva King of Concentration Sovereignty, Bodhisattva King of Dharma Sovereignty, Bodhisattva Dharma-Mark, Bodhisattva Light-Mark, Bodhisattva Light-Adornment, Bodhisattva Great Adornment, Bodhisattva Ratnākara,²³ Bodhisattva Eloquence-Accumulation, Bodhisattva Jewel-Hand, Bodhisattva Jewel-Seal-Hand, Bodhisattva Constantly-Raised-Hand, Bodhisattva Constantly-Lowered-Hand, Bodhisattva Constant Sorrow, Bodhisattva Joyful Root, Bodhisattva Joyful King, Bodhisattva Eloquent Voice, Bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha,²⁴ Bodhisattva Jewel-Torch-Bearer, Bodhisattva Jewel-Courage, Bodhisattva Jewel-Vision, Bodhisattva Indra's Net, Bodhisattva Bright Net, Bodhisattva Unconditioned Contemplation, Bodhisattva Wisdom-Accumulation, Bodhisattva Jewel-Victory, Bodhisattva Heavenly King, Bodhisattva Māra-Destroyer, Bodhisattva Lightning-Virtue, Bodhisattva Sovereign King, Bodhisattva Merit-Mark-Adornment, Bodhisattva Siṃhanāda,²⁵ Bodhisattva Thunder-Sound, Bodhisattva Mountain-Striking-Sound, Bodhisattva Fragrant Elephant, Bodhisattva White Fragrant Elephant, Bodhisattva Constant Vigor, Bodhisattva Never Resting, Bodhisattva Wonderful Birth, Bodhisattva Flower Adornment, Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara,²⁶ Bodhisattva Mahāsthāmaprāpta,²⁷ Bodhisattva Brahmā's Net, Bodhisattva Jewel-Staff, Bodhisattva Invincible, Bodhisattva Land-Adorner, Bodhisattva Golden Topknot, Bodhisattva Pearl Topknot, Bodhisattva Maitreya,²⁸ and Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī,²⁹ Prince of the Dharma—thirty-two thousand such persons in all.

Furthermore, there were ten thousand Brahmā-kings, Śikhin³⁰ and others, who had come from other four-continent worlds to the Buddha's presence to hear the Dharma. There were also twelve thousand Śakras³¹ who likewise came from other four-continent worlds to sit in the assembly. Together with other great and mighty devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas,³² and so forth, all came to sit in the assembly. Bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās³³ all came to sit in the assembly. At that time, the Buddha, surrounded respectfully by this immeasurable assembly of hundreds of thousands, expounded the Dharma for them. Like King Sumeru appearing in the great ocean, he sat peacefully upon a lion-throne adorned with all jewels, outshining all the assembled multitude.

## Ratnākara's Offering

At that time, in the city of Vaiśālī there was an elder's son named Ratnākara who, together with five hundred elder's sons, came to the Buddha's presence bearing jeweled canopies. They bowed their heads at his feet, and each offered their canopy in worship to the Buddha. Through the Buddha's awesome spiritual power, all the jeweled canopies merged into one canopy that covered the entire trichiliocosm.³⁴ The vast dimensions of this world-system were all visible within it. Moreover, within this trichiliocosm—all the Mount Sumerus, Snow Mountains, Mucilinda Mountains, Great Mucilinda Mountains, Fragrant Mountains, Jewel Mountains, Gold Mountains, Black Mountains, Iron-Ring Mountains, and Great Iron-Ring Mountains; the great oceans, rivers, streams, springs, and sources; the sun, moon, and stars; the palaces of the devas, nāgas, and various honored spirits—all appeared within the jeweled canopy. Furthermore, the buddhas of the ten directions and their exposition of Dharma also appeared within the jeweled canopy.

At that time, the entire great assembly beheld the Buddha's spiritual power and sighed at this unprecedented marvel. With palms joined, they bowed to the Buddha, gazing up at his honored countenance, their eyes not turning away for even a moment. Thereupon, the elder's son Ratnākara immediately spoke verses before the Buddha:

> "Eyes pure, long, and wide like blue lotuses,  
> Mind pure, having crossed all meditative states,  
> Long accumulating pure karma, called immeasurable,  
> Leading beings to quiescence—to you I bow.  
>   
> Having seen the Great Sage's spiritual transformations,  
> Universally manifesting immeasurable lands of the ten directions,  
> Wherein all buddhas expound the Dharma—  
> In this, all is seen and heard.  
>   
> The Dharma-King's Dharma-power transcends all beings,  
> Constantly bestowing Dharma-wealth upon all,  
> Skillfully distinguishing the characteristics of all dharmas,  
> Yet unmoved regarding ultimate truth—  
> Having attained sovereignty over all dharmas,  
> Therefore I bow to this Dharma-King.  
>   
> Expounding Dharma neither as existent nor non-existent,  
> Through causes and conditions all dharmas arise,  
> No self, no creator, no receiver,  
> Yet karma of good and evil is not lost.  
>   
> First at the Bodhi-tree, with power subduing Māra,  
> Attaining sweet dew's extinction, the enlightened Way accomplished,  
> Already without mind or thought, without grasping or action,  
> Yet completely crushing all heterodox teachers.  
>   
> Three turnings of the Dharma-wheel in the great trichiliocosm,  
> That wheel fundamentally and always pure,  
> Devas and humans attaining the Way—this is the proof,  
> The Three Jewels thus appearing in the world.  
>   
> With this sublime Dharma saving all beings,  
> Once received, never regressing, constantly quiescent,  
> Crossing old age, sickness, and death—Great Physician-King,  
> We should bow to the Dharma-ocean's boundless virtue.  
>   
> Unmoved by praise or blame, like Mount Sumeru,  
> Toward good and not-good, equal with compassion,  
> Mind practicing equality like empty space—  
> Who, hearing of this human jewel, would not respectfully receive?  
>   
> Now offering the World-Honored One this humble canopy,  
> Wherein appears my trichiliocosm,  
> The palaces where devas, nāgas, and spirits dwell,  
> Gandharvas and yakṣas too.  
>   
> All that exists in the world is seen,  
> The Ten Powers compassionately manifesting this transformation,  
> The multitude beholding the unprecedented, all praising the Buddha—  
> Now I bow to the Honored One of the Three Realms.  
>   
> The Great Sage Dharma-King, to whom all return,  
> With pure mind contemplating the Buddha, none not delighted,  
> Each seeing the World-Honored One before them—  
> This is spiritual power, an uncommon quality.  
>   
> The Buddha with one voice expounds the Dharma,  
> Sentient beings according to type each gaining understanding,  
> All considering the World-Honored One speaks their language—  
> This is spiritual power, an uncommon quality.  
>   
> The Buddha with one voice expounds the Dharma,  
> Sentient beings each according to their understanding,  
> All receiving, practicing, and obtaining benefit—  
> This is spiritual power, an uncommon quality.  
>   
> The Buddha with one voice expounds the Dharma,  
> Some fearful, some joyful,  
> Some generating renunciation, some severing doubt—  
> This is spiritual power, an uncommon quality.  
>   
> I bow to the Ten Powers' great vigor,  
> I bow to those who have attained fearlessness,  
> I bow to those abiding in uncommon qualities,  
> I bow to all great guides,  
> I bow to those able to sever all bondage,  
> I bow to those who have reached the other shore,  
> I bow to those able to ferry all worlds,  
> I bow to those forever free from the path of birth and death.  
>   
> Completely knowing sentient beings' comings and goings,  
> Skillful in all dharmas, attaining liberation,  
> Unattached to the world like a lotus flower,  
> Constantly and skillfully entering the practice of emptiness and quiescence,  
> Penetrating the characteristics of all dharmas without obstruction—  
> I bow to you, like space, without dependence."

## The Teaching on Pure Lands

At that time, after the elder's son Ratnākara had spoken these verses, he addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One, these five hundred elder's sons have all generated the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*.³⁵ They wish to hear how to attain a pure buddha-land. We only pray that the World-Honored One will explain the practices of bodhisattvas for purifying lands!"

The Buddha said: "Excellent, Ratnākara! That you are able to ask the Tathāgata on behalf of the bodhisattvas about the practices for purifying lands. Listen carefully, listen carefully! Think well upon this, and I shall explain it for you!" Thereupon Ratnākara and the five hundred elder's sons received the teaching and listened.

The Buddha said: "Ratnākara! The various classes of sentient beings are the bodhisattva's buddha-land.³⁶ Why is this so? A bodhisattva takes a buddha-land according to the sentient beings he transforms. A bodhisattva takes a buddha-land according to the sentient beings he tames. A bodhisattva takes a buddha-land according to what land sentient beings need to enter the Buddha's wisdom. A bodhisattva takes a buddha-land according to what land sentient beings need to arouse bodhisattva faculties. Why is this so? A bodhisattva's taking of a pure land is entirely for the sake of benefiting all sentient beings. It is like a person who wishes to construct a palace on empty ground—he may do so at will without obstruction. But if he tries to do so in empty space, he will never succeed! Bodhisattvas are like this: in order to accomplish sentient beings, they vow to take a buddha-land. Vowing to take a buddha-land is not [building] in emptiness.

"Ratnākara! You should know: An upright mind³⁷ is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings free from flattery will be born in his land. A profound mind³⁸ is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings replete with merit will be born in his land. The mind of bodhi³⁹ is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, Mahāyāna sentient beings will be born in his land. Giving is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings able to renounce all will be born in his land. Moral discipline is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings practicing the ten wholesome actions and fulfilling their vows will be born in his land. Patience is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings adorned with the thirty-two marks will be born in his land. Vigor is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings diligently cultivating all merits will be born in his land. Meditation is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings with collected and undistracted minds will be born in his land. Wisdom is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings in right concentration will be born in his land. The four immeasurables⁴⁰ are the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings accomplished in loving-kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity will be born in his land. The four means of attraction⁴¹ are the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings embraced by liberation will be born in his land. Skillful means is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings unobstructed in skillful means regarding all dharmas will be born in his land. The thirty-seven factors of enlightenment⁴² are the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings [practicing] the foundations of mindfulness, right efforts, bases of spiritual power, faculties, powers, factors of enlightenment, and path-factors will be born in his land. The mind of dedication⁴³ is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, he will attain a land replete with all merits. Teaching the elimination of the eight difficulties⁴⁴ is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, his land will be free from the three evil paths and the eight difficulties. Guarding one's own moral conduct without criticizing others' faults is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, his land will have no name for violating prohibitions. The ten wholesome actions⁴⁵ are the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings whose lives are not cut short, who are greatly wealthy, who practice pure conduct, whose words are truthful, who constantly use gentle speech, whose relatives do not separate, who skillfully reconcile disputes, whose words necessarily benefit, who are not jealous, not angry, and hold right views will be born in his land.

"Thus, Ratnākara! According to a bodhisattva's upright mind, he is able to generate practice. According to his generating practice, he attains a profound mind. According to his profound mind, his intention becomes tamed. According to the taming of his intention, he practices as he speaks. According to practicing as he speaks, he is able to dedicate [merit]. According to his dedication, he has skillful means. According to his skillful means, he accomplishes sentient beings. According to accomplishing sentient beings, the buddha-land becomes pure. According to the purity of the buddha-land, the Dharma-teaching becomes pure. According to the purity of Dharma-teaching, wisdom becomes pure. According to the purity of wisdom, the mind becomes pure. According to the purity of mind, all merits become pure. Therefore, Ratnākara! If a bodhisattva wishes to attain a pure land, he should purify his mind. According to the purity of his mind, the buddha-land becomes pure."⁴⁶

## Śāriputra's Doubt and the Buddha's Response

At that time, Śāriputra,⁴⁷ empowered by the Buddha's awesome spiritual power, had this thought: "If when a bodhisattva's mind is pure, the buddha-land becomes pure, then when our World-Honored One was formerly practicing as a bodhisattva, was his intention not pure? Yet this buddha-land is impure like this!"

The Buddha, knowing his thought, immediately addressed him: "What do you think? Are the sun and moon not pure, yet the blind do not see them?"

He replied: "No, World-Honored One! This is the blind person's fault, not the fault of the sun and moon."

"Śāriputra! Because of sentient beings' transgressions, they do not see the Tathāgata's buddha-land's magnificent purity—it is not the Tathāgata's fault. Śāriputra! This land of mine is pure, yet you do not see it."

At that time, the Brahmā-king Jālinīprabha⁴⁸ addressed Śāriputra: "Do not have this thought, considering this buddha-land to be impure. Why is this so? I see Śākyamuni Buddha's land as pure, like the palace of the Paranirmita-vaśavartin heaven."⁴⁹

Śāriputra said: "I see this land full of hills, valleys, pits, thorns, sand, gravel, earth, stone mountains, and filth."

The Brahmā-king Jālinīprabha said: "Venerable one, your mind has highs and lows and does not rely on the Buddha's wisdom, therefore you see this land as impure! Śāriputra! Bodhisattvas are completely equal toward all sentient beings, their profound minds pure, relying on the Buddha's wisdom—then they are able to see this buddha-land as pure."

Thereupon the Buddha pressed the earth with his toe, and immediately the trichiliocosm was adorned with hundreds of thousands of jewels, like the Land of Immeasurable Merit and Jewel Adornment of the Buddha Ratnaketu.⁵⁰ The entire great assembly sighed at this unprecedented marvel, and all saw themselves sitting upon jeweled lotus flowers.

The Buddha told Śāriputra: "Do you now observe this buddha-land's magnificent purity?"

Śāriputra said: "Indeed so, World-Honored One! What I had never before seen or heard, the buddha-land's magnificent purity now all appears."

The Buddha addressed Śāriputra: "My buddha-land is constantly pure like this. In order to save inferior people, I manifest this land full of various evils and impurities! It is like when the devas eat from jeweled vessels—according to their merit, the color of the food differs. Likewise, Śāriputra! If a person's mind is pure, he then sees this land's meritorious adornment."

When the Buddha manifested this land's magnificent purity, the five hundred elder's sons led by Ratnākara all attained the patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas, and eighty-four thousand persons all generated the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. The Buddha withdrew his spiritual powers, and thereupon this world returned to its former state. Those seeking the Śrāvaka vehicle—thirty-two thousand devas and humans—knowing that conditioned dharmas are all impermanent, became far from dust and free from defilement, attaining the pure Dharma-eye.⁵¹ Eight thousand bhikṣus, not grasping any dharmas, exhausted the outflows and liberated their minds.⁵²

The four fearlessnesses (*catur-vaiśāradya*) are confidence in teaching.

²² **[Philosophical]** Five paths of existence (五道, *pañca-gati*). The realms of rebirth: hells, hungry ghosts, animals, humans, and devas. Bodhisattvas voluntarily take birth in all realms to save beings.

Devas (gods), nāgas (serpent-spirits), yakṣas (nature spirits), gandharvas (celestial musicians), asuras (titans), garuḍas (bird-spirits), kiṃnaras (horse-headed musicians), and mahoragas (great serpents). These represent the non-human beings who protect and support the Dharma.

³⁴ **[Philosophical]** Trichiliocosm (三千大千世界, *tri-sāhasra-mahā-sāhasra-loka-dhātu*). A billion-world system in Buddhist cosmology. The merging of the canopies into one that encompasses this vast realm demonstrates the non-dual nature of reality.

³⁵ **[Textual]** *Anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi* (阿耨多羅三藐三菩提). "Unsurpassed, complete, perfect enlightenment." The supreme awakening of a buddha.

³⁶ **[Philosophical]** **KEY DOCTRINE**: "Sentient beings are the bodhisattva's buddha-land" (眾生之類是菩薩佛土). This revolutionary teaching redefines pure lands not as external paradises but as the result of transforming sentient beings. The purity of the land depends on the purity of its inhabitants, which in turn depends on the bodhisattva's practice. This teaching bridges the apparent gap between the Mahāyāna emphasis on pure lands and the bodhisattva's commitment to working in impure realms. **[Cross-reference]** Compare with the Lotus Sutra's teaching that the Sahā world is actually Śākyamuni's eternal pure land, hidden from those with impure vision.

³⁷ **[Philosophical]** Upright mind (直心, *ṛju-citta*). Sincerity, honesty, straightforwardness. The foundation of all bodhisattva practice.

⁴¹ **[Philosophical]** Four means of attraction (四攝法, *catvāri-saṃgraha-vastūni*). Giving, kind speech, beneficial conduct, and cooperation. Methods bodhisattvas use to attract and guide beings to the Dharma.

⁴² **[Philosophical]** Thirty-seven factors of enlightenment (三十七道品, *saptatriṃśad-bodhipakṣika-dharmāḥ*). The complete set of practices leading to awakening: four foundations of mindfulness, four right efforts, four bases of spiritual power, five faculties, five powers, seven factors of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path.

⁴³ **[Philosophical]** Mind of dedication (迴向心, *pariṇāmanā-citta*). The practice of dedicating all merit toward the enlightenment of all beings rather than one's own benefit.

⁴⁴ **[Textual]** Eight difficulties (八難, *aṣṭa-akṣaṇāni*). Eight conditions that make it difficult to encounter the Dharma: birth in hell, as a hungry ghost, as an animal, in a long-lived heaven, in a border region, with impaired faculties, with wrong views, or in a time without a buddha.

⁴⁵ **[Philosophical]** Ten wholesome actions (十善, *daśa-kuśala-karmāṇi*). Abstaining from killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, divisive speech, harsh speech, idle chatter, covetousness, ill-will, and wrong views.

⁴⁶ **[Philosophical]** **CENTRAL TEACHING**: "According to the purity of mind, the buddha-land becomes pure" (隨其心淨，則佛土淨). This famous statement encapsulates the Vimalakirti Sutra's teaching on pure lands. It emphasizes that external purity is a reflection of internal purity—the environment is not separate from mind. This teaching has profound implications for Buddhist practice, suggesting that purifying one's mind is equivalent to purifying the world. **[Modern]** This resonates with contemporary understandings of how consciousness shapes perception and experience, though the Buddhist teaching goes further in asserting the mind's role in actually constituting reality.

⁴⁷ **[Textual]** Śāriputra (舍利弗, *Śāriputra*). "Son of Śārī." One of the Buddha's foremost disciples, renowned for his wisdom. In Mahāyāna sutras, he often represents the Śrāvaka perspective that must be transcended.

⁴⁸ **[Textual]** Jālinīprabha (螺髻梵王, *Jālinīprabha*). "Spiral-Topknot Brahmā-King." A Brahmā deity with matted hair coiled in a spiral, representing a higher level of spiritual vision than Śāriputra.

⁴⁹ **[Textual]** Paranirmita-vaśavartin heaven (自在天宮). The highest of the six desire-realm heavens, where deities have power over others' creations. Its splendor represents a high but still mundane level of purity.

⁵⁰ **[Textual]** Buddha Ratnaketu (寶莊嚴佛, *Ratnaketu*). "Jewel-Banner Buddha." A buddha whose pure land serves as the model for the temporary transformation of this world.

⁵¹ **[Philosophical]** Pure Dharma-eye (法眼淨, *dharma-cakṣus-viśuddhi*). The first stage of realization in the Śrāvaka path, seeing the truth of the Four Noble Truths and entering the stream to nirvāṇa.

⁵² **[Philosophical]** Exhausted the outflows and liberated their minds (漏盡意解, *āsrava-kṣaya*). Complete arhatship—freedom from all mental defilements and liberation from rebirth.

### Key Concepts

**Pure Land Soteriology**: This chapter presents a distinctive Mahāyāna teaching on pure lands that differs from the devotional Pure Land schools. Rather than emphasizing rebirth in Amitābha's Sukhāvatī through faith and recitation, the Vimalakirti Sutra teaches that pure lands arise from the bodhisattva's practice of purifying sentient beings. The land's purity is not separate from the purity of its inhabitants' minds.

**Non-Duality of Subject and Environment**: The teaching that "sentient beings are the bodhisattva's buddha-land" implies a non-dual relationship between consciousness and environment. This anticipates the sutra's central theme of non-duality, which will be fully developed in Chapter 9.

**Skillful Means and Relative Truth**: The Buddha's explanation that he manifests an impure land to save "inferior people" demonstrates the Mahāyāna teaching of skillful means. The same reality appears differently according to the observer's spiritual capacity—this is not deception but compassionate adaptation.

**Bodhisattva Path vs. Śrāvaka Path**: The chapter contrasts the bodhisattva ideal (represented by the 32,000 bodhisattvas and Ratnākara) with the Śrāvaka path (represented by Śāriputra). While both attain liberation, bodhisattvas work to purify lands and save beings, while śrāvakas seek personal nirvāṇa.
