# Chapter 8: The Buddha Path (aka "The Wrong Side of the Tracks")

**Blues Vernacular Translation by Master John Kim**

---

## 1. Entering the Game

Manjushri asks, "Yo, V. How does a spiritual warrior get on the Buddha Path? How do we get in the zone?"

Vimalakirti leans forward, spins his cane, and says:
"You gotta walk the path where nobody else wants to walk. You gotta go **Off-Road**. That's the Path."

Manjushri: "Breaking it down for me. What you mean 'Off-Road'?"

Vimalakirti:
"It means you go to the places where the trouble is.
You commit the Five Deadly Sins—but you don't get angry or stressed about it.
You go to Hell—but you keep your hands clean.
You hang with the animals—but you don't act like a beast.
You hang with the hungry ghosts—but you stay full of goodness.
You go to heaven—but you don't get high on your own supply.

"You act greedy—but you let go of everything.
You act angry—but you got nothing but love for the haters.
You act stupid—but you're playing 4D chess with your mind.
You break the rules—but inside, you're tighter than a drum.
You act lazy—but you're working harder than James Brown.
You act crazy—but your focus is laser-sharp.

"You act like a hustler—but you're bridging the gap for everybody.
You hang with the demons—but you're working for the Big Boss (Buddha).
You act poor—but you got a hand full of diamonds.
You act crippled—but you're standing tall like a mountain.
You act old and sick—but you done fired the Grim Reaper.

"In short: You go down the wrong path to find the right people. You act like a sinner to save the sinners. That's the Buddha Path."

## 2. The Dirt is the Fertilizer

Then Vimalakirti flips the script on Manjushri. "Okay, genius. What's the **seed** of the Buddha? Where does enlightenment grow from?"

Manjushri doesn't blink. He knows the answer.
"The body is the seed.
Ignorance is the seed.
Craving is the seed.
Anger, greed, and confusion—that's the seed.
Running the streets, making mistakes, getting in trouble... that's the seed.
Basically: **The mess is the message.**"

Vimalakirti: "Preach."

Manjushri: "See, if you're already clean, if you're sitting up on a high, dry mountain where everything is perfect... nothing grows there. Lotuses don't handle dry land.
"Lotuses need mud. They need the swamp. They need the muck.
"If you cut off all your problems and sit in a cave like a statue, you ain't never gonna grow the Buddha-flower.
"Only when you down in the mud of the streets, struggling with the heat—that's when the Magic happens.
"Basically: **No mud, no lotus.**"

## 3. The Old Man Cries

Mahakashyapa (the head monk, the old school guy) hears this and shakes his head. "Man, that is beautiful. And it hurts.
"You're saying the sinners got a better shot than we do. The people in the gutter are closer to the light than the monks in the temple.
"We sterilized ourselves. We cut off the desire so good that we can't grow nothing anymore. We're like burnt seeds.
"But the common man? He's messy. He's got desire. He's got passion. And that passion can be turned into waking up.
"We're stuck being 'good.' They got the potential to be Great."

## 4. Vimalakirti's Crew

Then a Bodhisattva in the crowd asks Vimalakirti, "Yo, V. Where's your family? Who's your crew? We see you rolling solo, but you gotta have people."

Vimalakirti smiles and drops a freestyle verse:

"Wisdom is my Mama.
Skillful Means is my Daddy.
That's how Buddhas are born—from the union of Smarts and Style.

The Joy of the Dharma—that's my Wife.
Kindness and Compassion—those are my Daughters.
Honesty and Good Vibes—those are my Sons.
Emptiness—that's my House. It's big enough for everybody.

My disciples? The dust of the world. I spin 'em how I want.
My friends? The energetic practices. They got my back.

The Great Vehicle—that's my Cadillac.
Mindfulness is the driver.
The Eightfold Path is the highway.

My look? I wear Shame and Scruples like a tuxedo.
My bling? The Seven Treasures of the Dharma.
My money? Teaching people how to get free.

My food? The sweet nectar of Truth.
My drink? The juice of Liberation.
My bath? A clear mind.

I act like I'm playing the game, but I know the score.
I show up in the hells to bail people out.
I act like I'm hungry to feed the hungry.
I act like I'm rich to help the poor.
I act like a boss to humble the arrogant.
I act like a servant to lift up the lowly.

I can be a prostitute to hook the lovers.
I can be a king to lead the nation.
I can be a doctor to heal the sick.

I'm whatever the situation needs me to be.
I got no fixed shape.
I got no fixed address.
My address is wherever you are suffering.

That's my crew. That's my life. That's the Path."

## Blues Commentary

This chapter is the **Anthem of the Hustler Bodhisattva**.

The "Non-Path" (Amarga) is what jazz musicians call playing "outside." You step out of the key signature. You hit a wrong note on purpose to create tension, and then you resolve it back to the root. If you just play the scale perfectly, it's boring. You gotta get dirty to make it swing.

Manjushri drops the heavy truth: **Enlightenment runs on fuel.** And the fuel is your baggage. If you act like you got no baggage, you got no gas in the tank. The Lotus needs the mud. The Blues needs the pain. You don't get the joy without the sorrow.

And Vimalakirti's family? That's the coolest breakdown of the "internal entourage." You don't need a literal posse if you got Wisdom as your Mom and Style as your Dad. You're never alone if you're kicking it with the Truth.

### Song Track: "Lotus in the Mud"

*(Gritty electric guitar riff, slow stomp beat)*

**Verse 1**
I went up to the mountain, the air was clean and dry
Sat there for a thousand years, watching clouds go by
But nothing ever grew there, just rocks and dusty ground
I realized the treasure wasn't waiting to be found

**Chorus**
You gotta get down in the mud (yeah, yeah)
You gotta get down in the mud
If you want that flower to bloom, baby
You gotta get down in the mud

**Verse 2**
They say sin is a devil, they say desire is bad
But it's the only fuel for the fire I ever had
I took my anger and I turned it into drive
I took my sorrow and I made it come alive

**Bridge**
Don't tell me 'bout your purity
Don't tell me 'bout your grace
Unless you been to the bottom
And seen the devil's face
My Daddy is the Method, my Mama is the Wise
And I'm blooming through the darkness right before your eyes

**Outro**
Mud... mud... glorious mud...
That's where the beauty starts...
Deep in the dirty parts...
(Guitar solo fades out into feedback)
