# Chapter 14: Entrusting Blues

**Blues Translation by Master John Kim**

---

## The Buddha Gives It to Maitreya

Right then, the Buddha spoke to the Bodhisattva Maitreya:¹ "Maitreya! I'm now entrusting to you the Dharma of supreme enlightenment² that I've gathered over countless millions of kalpas.³ Sūtras like this one—in the final age after I'm gone⁴—you and your kind should use supernatural power to spread them all over this world.⁵ Don't let them get cut off.

"Why? In future ages, there's gonna be good men and women,⁶ and gods, dragons, spirits, gandharvas, and rakṣasas,⁷ who generate the mind of supreme enlightenment and love the great Dharma.⁸ If they don't hear sūtras like this, they'll lose this excellent benefit.⁹

"When such folks hear these sūtras, they'll definitely believe and get real excited, generating a rare aspiration.¹⁰ They should receive them with the crown of their heads.¹¹ According to what benefits beings are ready for, explain broadly for them."¹²

---

## Two Kinds of Bodhisattvas

"Maitreya! You should know: bodhisattvas got two characteristics.¹³ What are the two?

"First: they like elaborate phrases and fancy writing.¹⁴

"Second: they don't fear profound meaning and can really enter it.¹⁵

"Them that like elaborate phrases and fancy writing—know that these are new-learner bodhisattvas.¹⁶ Them that, when it comes to these undefiled, unattached, real deep sūtras,¹⁷ ain't scared, can enter them, and hearing them their minds get pure,¹⁸ accepting, upholding, reading, reciting, practicing what's taught—know that these been practicing the path a long time.¹⁹

---

## What Holds New Folks Back

"Maitreya! There's two more things that keep them called new learners from being able to get into profound Dharma.²⁰ What are the two?

"First: never having heard profound sūtras before, when they hear them they get startled, doubt, and can't follow.²¹ They slander and don't believe, saying: 'I never heard this before—where'd it come from?'²²

"Second: if there's folks who protect, uphold, and explain such profound sūtras, they refuse to approach them, serve them, or respect them.²³ Sometimes they talk bad about them.²⁴

"Having these two things—know that this is a new-learner bodhisattva who's hurting himself²⁵ and can't, in profound Dharma, train his mind."²⁶

---

## What Holds Even Believers Back

"Maitreya! There's two more things: even though a bodhisattva believes and understands profound Dharma, he still hurts himself and can't get the patience of non-arising.²⁷ What are the two?

"First: looking down on new-learner bodhisattvas and not teaching them.²⁸

"Second: even though understanding profound Dharma, still grasping at characteristics and making discriminations.²⁹

"That's the two."³⁰

---

## Maitreya Says He's In

When Maitreya heard this, he said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! Unprecedented! Like you taught, I'll stay away from such evils³¹ and uphold the Dharma of supreme enlightenment that you gathered over countless kalpas.³²

"If in future ages there's good men and women seeking the Mahāyāna,³³ I'll make sure they get these sūtras in their hands.³⁴ I'll give them the power of mindfulness, so they can accept, uphold, read, recite, and explain to others.³⁵

"World-Honored One! If in the final age there's folks who can accept, uphold, read, recite, and explain for others,³⁶ know that they're all established through Maitreya's supernatural power."³⁷

---

## The Buddha Says Right On

The Buddha said: "Excellent! Excellent! Maitreya! What you said—the Buddha rejoices with you."³⁸

---

## All the Bodhisattvas Vow

Right then, all the bodhisattvas joined palms and said to the Buddha: "We also, after you're gone, will widely spread the Dharma of supreme enlightenment throughout the lands of ten directions.³⁹ We'll also guide them that teach the Dharma, helping them get this sūtra."⁴⁰

---

## The Four Kings Vow

Right then, the Four Heavenly Kings⁴¹ said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! Everywhere—cities, villages, towns, mountain forests, wilderness—wherever this sūtra exists, wherever it's read, recited, and explained,⁴² we'll lead our crews there to hear the Dharma. We'll protect them folks, guarding them for a hundred yojanas in every direction,⁴³ not letting anybody who's looking for a chance against them find one."⁴⁴

---

## Passing It to Ānanda

Right then, the Buddha told Ānanda: "Accept and uphold this sūtra and broadly spread it."⁴⁵

Ānanda said: "So be it! I've accepted and upheld its essentials.⁴⁶ World-Honored One! What should this sūtra be called?"⁴⁷

---

## The Name

The Buddha said: "Ānanda! This sūtra is called 'The Teaching of Vimalakirti.'⁴⁸ It's also called 'The Dharma-Gate of Inconceivable Liberation.'⁴⁹ That's how you should accept and uphold it."⁵⁰

---

## The End

When the Buddha finished teaching this sūtra, the elder Vimalakirti, Mañjuśrī, Śāriputra, Ānanda, and all the gods, humans, asuras, and the whole assembly heard what the Buddha taught.⁵¹ Everybody was greatly delighted.⁵²

## Theological Note

### The Handoff

The Buddha's giving this teaching to Maitreya for safekeeping. When times get hard—the Dharma-ending age—Maitreya and all them bodhisattvas gonna make sure folks can still find this sūtra. The Four Heavenly Kings gonna guard anybody who teaches it. Protection is built in.

### Two Kinds of Practitioners

Them that love fancy language—new learners. Them that ain't scared of going deep—old hands. The test ain't what sounds pretty to you—it's whether you can handle what's REAL.

### Four Ways to Hurt Yourself

1. Get scared of deep sūtras and reject them
2. Avoid and criticize teachers who got the goods
3. Look down on beginners instead of helping them
4. Even if you understand, keep grasping and discriminating

All four are self-harm. You're blocking your own path.

### Two Names, One Sūtra

"The Teaching of Vimalakirti"—that's personal, about the man.
"The Dharma-Gate of Inconceivable Liberation"—that's doctrinal, about what it teaches.

Both names are true. The layman spoke it. The liberation is beyond thought.

---

## Blues Finale

We done walked through all fourteen chapters now. From the Buddha Land where Vimalakirti showed that the ground is pure when the mind is pure, through all them bodhisattvas and disciples getting schooled, to Mañjuśrī's visit and the thunderous silence on non-duality, to Akṣobhya's whole world getting brought here like a flower garland—and now the handoff to the future.

This teaching says: Don't be scared of what's deep. Don't run from what's strange. Don't look down on them just starting out. And don't grasp even at your understanding.

The layman knew what the monks had forgot. The silence said more than all the words. And the Dharma-Gate of Inconceivable Liberation stays open.

**Everybody was greatly delighted.**
