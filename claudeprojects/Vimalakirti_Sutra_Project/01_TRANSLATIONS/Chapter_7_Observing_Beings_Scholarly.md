# Chapter 7: Observing Sentient Beings (觀眾生品)

**Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel**

## The Question of Vision

At that time, Mañjuśrī asked Vimalakirti: "How should a bodhisattva observe sentient beings?"¹

Vimalakirti said: "Like a magician observing the persons he has conjured,² so should a bodhisattva observe sentient beings. Like a wise person viewing a reflection in water; like viewing an image in a mirror;³ like a mirage in heat; like the echo of a voice; like clouds in the sky; like form in the formless realm; like the path of a bird in the sky; like the child of a barren woman; like the arising of afflictions in a conjured person;⁴ like seeing in a dream after awakening; like the receiving of a body by one who has entered nirvāṇa; like fire without fuel⁵—thus should a bodhisattva observe sentient beings."

---

## Compassion Without Object

Mañjuśrī said: "If a bodhisattva contemplates in this way, how should they practice loving-kindness (*maitrī*)?"⁶

Vimalakirti said: "Having contemplated in this way, the bodhisattva thinks: 'I shall expound such Dharma to sentient beings.'⁷ This is true loving-kindness.

"Practice the loving-kindness of extinction—because there is no arising. Practice the loving-kindness that is without heat—because there is no affliction. Practice the loving-kindness of equality—because it is equal throughout the three times. Practice the loving-kindness without conflict—because nothing arises. Practice the loving-kindness of non-duality—because inside and outside do not come together. Practice the loving-kindness that is indestructible—because it is finally exhausted [of self].⁸

"Practice the loving-kindness that is firm—because the mind is not destroyed. Practice the loving-kindness that is pure—because the nature of all dharmas is pure. Practice the loving-kindness without limit—like empty space. Practice the loving-kindness of an arhat—because it destroys the bandits of affliction. Practice the loving-kindness of a bodhisattva—because it brings beings to peace. Practice the loving-kindness of a Tathāgata—because it attains the characteristic of suchness.

"Practice the loving-kindness of a Buddha—because it awakens sentient beings. Practice the loving-kindness that is spontaneous—because it is attained without cause.⁹ Practice the loving-kindness of awakening (*bodhi*)—because it is of one taste. Practice the loving-kindness without equal—because it cuts off all craving. Practice the loving-kindness of great compassion—because it leads by the Great Vehicle. Practice the loving-kindness that is unwearying—because it contemplates emptiness and non-self.

"Practice the loving-kindness of Dharma-giving (*dharma-dāna*)—because it holds nothing back. Practice the loving-kindness of moral discipline (*śīla*)—because it transforms those who transgress. Practice the loving-kindness of patience (*kṣānti*)—because it protects self and others. Practice the loving-kindness of vigor (*vīrya*)—because it takes up the burden of sentient beings. Practice the loving-kindness of meditation (*dhyāna*)—because it does not accept the taste. Practice the loving-kindness of wisdom (*prajñā*)—because there is no not-knowing-the-time.

"Practice the loving-kindness of skillful means (*upāya*)—because all is manifested. Practice the loving-kindness without concealment—because the straight mind is pure. Practice the loving-kindness of deep mind—because there is no mixed practice. Practice the loving-kindness without deception—because it is not false. Practice the loving-kindness of joyfulness—because it causes the attainment of Buddha-joy. The loving-kindness of the bodhisattva is thus."

## Compassion, Sympathetic Joy, and Equanimity

Mañjuśrī again asked: "What is called compassion (*karuṇā*)?"¹⁰

He answered: "The merit accomplished by the bodhisattva is shared with all sentient beings."

"What is called sympathetic joy (*muditā*)?"

He answered: "Whatever benefit there is, one rejoices without regret."

"What is called equanimity (*upekṣā*)?"

He answered: "Whatever merit is performed, there is no expectation."¹¹

---

## What Sentient Beings Rely On

Mañjuśrī again asked: "In the fear of birth and death, on what should the bodhisattva rely?"

Vimalakirti said: "The bodhisattva in the fear of birth and death should rely on the power of the Tathāgata's merit."¹²

Mañjuśrī again asked: "If the bodhisattva wishes to rely on the power of the Tathāgata's merit, where should they abide?"

He answered: "If the bodhisattva wishes to rely on the power of the Tathāgata's merit, they should abide in liberating all sentient beings."

Again he asked: "Wishing to liberate sentient beings, what should be eliminated?"

He answered: "Wishing to liberate sentient beings, one should eliminate their afflictions."

Again he asked: "Wishing to eliminate afflictions, what should be practiced?"

He answered: "Practice right mindfulness (*samyak-smṛti*)."

Again he asked: "How does one practice right mindfulness?"

He answered: "Practice the unborn and unceasing."

Again he asked: "What dharma doesn't arise? What dharma doesn't cease?"

He answered: "The unwholesome doesn't arise; the wholesome doesn't cease."

Again he asked: "What is the root of the wholesome and unwholesome?"

He answered: "The body is the root."¹³

Again he asked: "What is the root of the body?"

He answered: "Desire and craving is the root."

Again he asked: "What is the root of desire and craving?"

He answered: "False discrimination is the root."¹⁴

Again he asked: "What is the root of false discrimination?"

He answered: "Inverted thought is the root."

Again he asked: "What is the root of inverted thought?"

He answered: "Non-abiding (*apratisṭhāna*) is the root."¹⁵

Again he asked: "What is the root of non-abiding?"

He answered: "Non-abiding is without root. Mañjuśrī! From the rootless root of non-abiding, all dharmas are established."¹⁶

## The Goddess and the Flowers

At that time, there was a goddess in Vimalakirti's room. Seeing these great beings hearing the Dharma expounded, she revealed her form and scattered heavenly flowers over the bodhisattvas and great disciples. When the flowers reached the bodhisattvas, they all fell away. When they reached the great disciples, they stuck and would not fall. All the disciples used their spiritual powers to remove the flowers, but could not make them drop.

Then the goddess asked Śāriputra: "Why do you try to remove the flowers?"

He answered: "These flowers are not in accordance with the Dharma, therefore I remove them."

The goddess said: "Do not say these flowers are not in accordance with the Dharma. Why? These flowers are without discrimination—it is the venerable one who generates discriminating thought. If one who has left home in accordance with Buddha-Dharma has discrimination, this is not in accordance with the Dharma. If without discrimination, this is in accordance with the Dharma.

"Look at the bodhisattvas—the flowers do not stick to them because they have already cut off all discriminating thought. Like one who is afraid—non-humans gain access to him. Thus, the disciples fear birth and death, so form, sound, smell, taste, and touch gain access to them. Those who are separated from fear—the five desires can do nothing to them. Where habit-energies (*vāsanā*) are not exhausted, the flowers stick. Where habit-energies are exhausted, the flowers do not stick."¹⁷

## The Dialogue on Time and Liberation

Śāriputra said: "Goddess! How long have you been in this room?"

She answered: "I have been in this room as long as the venerable elder's liberation."

Śāriputra said: "You have been here that long?"

The goddess said: "Is the venerable elder's liberation that old?"¹⁸

Śāriputra was silent and did not answer.

The goddess said: "Why is the great wise elder silent?"

He answered: "Liberation is without words, therefore I do not know what to say."

The goddess said: "Words and letters are all liberation-characteristics. Why is this? Liberation is not internal, not external, not in between. Letters also are not internal, not external, not in between. Therefore, Śāriputra! Do not separate from letters to speak of liberation. Why? All dharmas are liberation-characteristics."

---

## Neither Desire, Anger, nor Delusion

Śāriputra said: "Is it not liberation to separate from desire, anger, and delusion?"

The goddess said: "The Buddha spoke of separating from desire, anger, and delusion as liberation for those with excessive pride (*adhimāna*). For those without excessive pride, the Buddha taught that the nature of desire, anger, and delusion is itself liberation."¹⁹

Śāriputra said: "Excellent, excellent! Goddess! What have you attained? What have you realized, that your eloquence is like this?"

The goddess said: "I have attained nothing and realized nothing—therefore my eloquence is like this. Why? If anyone has attainment and realization, with respect to Buddha-Dharma they have excessive pride."

---

## The Three Vehicles

Śāriputra asked the goddess: "Of the three vehicles, which do you aspire to?"

The goddess said: "When I teach sentient beings using śrāvaka-dharma, I am a śrāvaka. When I teach using pratyekabuddha-dharma, I am a pratyekabuddha. When I teach using great compassion, I am of the Great Vehicle.

"Śāriputra! Like one who enters a *campaka* grove and smells only *campaka*, not other fragrances, so one entering this room smells only the fragrance of Buddha-merit, not the fragrance of śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha merit.

"Śāriputra! When Śakra, Brahmā, the Four Heavenly Kings, and the devas, dragons, and spirits enter this room, hearing this superior person expound the right Dharma, they all delight in the fragrance of Buddha-merit and arouse the aspiration [for unexcelled awakening].

"Śāriputra! I have been in this room for twelve years. I have never heard the Dharma of śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha—only the great compassion, the inconceivable, the Buddha-Dharma of all Buddhas.

"Śāriputra! This room constantly manifests eight unprecedented and difficult-to-attain dharmas. What are the eight?

"This room always shines with golden light, day and night without difference, not illuminated by sun or moon—this is the first.

"Those who enter this room are not troubled by defilements—this is the second.

"This room is never without Śakra, Brahmā, the Four Heavenly Kings, and bodhisattvas from other lands—this is the third.²⁰

"This room always expounds the six perfections (*pāramitās*) and the non-retrogressive Dharma—this is the fourth.

"This room always produces heavenly music of the foremost among humans and devas, with strings emanating immeasurable sounds of Dharma-transformation—this is the fifth.

"This room has four great treasuries, full of accumulated jewels, supplying the poor without exhausting—this is the sixth.

"This room, when this superior person contemplates, is immediately visited by Śākyamuni Buddha, Amitābha Buddha, Akṣobhya Buddha, Precious Virtue, Precious Flame, Precious Moon, Precious Adornment, Difficult to Conquer, Lion Sound, All-Accomplishing, and other immeasurable Buddhas of the ten directions. They extensively expound the secret and essential Dharma-treasure of all Buddhas, and having spoken, they return—this is the seventh.²¹

"In this room, all the magnificently adorned palaces of the devas and the pure lands of all Buddhas all appear within it—this is the eighth.

"Śāriputra! This room constantly manifests these eight unprecedented and difficult-to-attain dharmas. Who, seeing these inconceivable things, would still delight in śrāvaka-dharma?"

## Why Not Transform the Female Body?

Śāriputra asked: "Why do you not transform your female body?"²²

The goddess said: "For the past twelve years I have sought the characteristics of a female—I cannot find them. What is there to transform? It is like a magician who creates an illusory woman. If someone asks, 'Why don't you transform your female body?'—is this person asking correctly?"

Śāriputra said: "No! An illusion has no fixed characteristics—what would be transformed?"

The goddess said: "All dharmas are likewise—without fixed characteristics. Why do you ask, 'Why don't you transform your female body?'"

Immediately, the goddess used her spiritual powers to transform Śāriputra into her form, while she transformed herself into Śāriputra's form and asked: "Why don't you transform your female body?"

Śāriputra, in the goddess's form, answered: "I do not know how I have transformed into a female body!"²³

The goddess said: "Śāriputra! If you could transform this female body, then all women could also transform. Just as Śāriputra is not female yet appears as a female body, so too all women—though they appear as female bodies—are not female. Therefore the Buddha says: 'All dharmas are neither male nor female.'"²⁴

Immediately, the goddess withdrew her spiritual powers, and Śāriputra's body returned to its former state.

The goddess asked Śāriputra: "Where now are the forms and characteristics of the female body?"

Śāriputra said: "The forms and characteristics of the female body are neither present nor absent."

The goddess said: "All dharmas are likewise—neither present nor absent. That they are neither present nor absent is what the Buddha teaches."

---

## Where Will the Goddess Be Born?

Śāriputra asked the goddess: "When you pass away from here, where will you be born?"

The goddess said: "I will be born as the Buddha's transformation is born."

He said: "The Buddha's transformation is not birth and death."

The goddess said: "Sentient beings are likewise—no birth and death."²⁵

Śāriputra asked the goddess: "How long until you attain *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*?"

The goddess said: "When Śāriputra returns to being an ordinary person, then I shall attain *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*."

Śāriputra said: "It is impossible for me to return to being an ordinary person."

The goddess said: "It is likewise impossible for me to attain *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*. Why? Because bodhi has no place of abiding—therefore no one attains it."

Śāriputra said: "Present Buddhas have attained *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*, those who have already attained it and those who will attain it are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges—how do you explain this?"

The goddess said: "All this is spoken in terms of worldly conventional language and numbers. Bodhi is not past, future, or present."

The goddess said: "Śāriputra! Have you attained the arhat path?"

He said: "I attained it because there is nothing to attain."

The goddess said: "Buddhas and bodhisattvas are likewise—they attain because there is nothing to attain."

---

## The Goddess's Identity

At that time, Vimalakirti said to Śāriputra: "This goddess has already made offerings to ninety-two billion Buddhas. She can sport in the spiritual powers of bodhisattvas. Her vows are complete; she has attained non-arising patience (*anutpattika-dharma-kṣānti*) and abides in non-retrogression (*avaivartika*). By her original vow, she appears according to her intentions, teaching and transforming sentient beings."

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Footnotes

1.  **How should a bodhisattva observe sentient beings?** (菩薩云何觀於眾生): This inquiry shifts the dialogue from emptiness of phenomena to the emptiness of the person (*pudgala-nairātmya*). Mañjuśrī challenges Vimalakirti to reconcile the bodhisattva's vow to save beings with the ultimate truth that no "being" exists.
2.  **Like a magician**: *Māyākāra*. The simile of the magician is central to Mahāyāna ontology. Beings exist conventionally, like illusions created by a magician, but lack intrinsic existence (*svabhāva*).
3.  **Viewing an image in a mirror**: This metaphor emphasizes that sentient beings are reflections of causes and conditions, appearing clearly yet devoid of substance.
4.  **Afflictions in a conjured person**: A particularly layered metaphor. A conjured person cannot truly have afflictions (*kleśa*) because they have no mind; similarly, ultimate reality is free of affliction, yet the appearance of affliction drives the wheel of samsara.
5.  **Fire without fuel**: Indicating an impossibility. Trying to find a substantial "self" in the aggregates is as futile as seeking fire without fuel.
6.  **Loving-kindness** (*maitrī*): Mañjuśrī's follow-up is critical. If beings are illusions, to whom is kindness directed? This is the paradox of "objectless compassion" (*anālambana-karuṇā*).
7.  **Expound such Dharma**: Vimalakirti redefines compassion not as emotional attachment to persons, but as the will to awaken them to their own illusoriness.
8.  **Indestructible**: The text here plays on the double meaning of "exhaustion" (*kṣaya*). True kindness is indestructible because the false self has been exhausted.
9.  **Spontaneous**: *Anabhisaṃskāra*. Compassion that arises without volition or calculation, flowing naturally from wisdom.
10. **Compassion** (*karuṇā*): Distinguished here from maitrī. Maitrī is the wish for happiness; karuṇā is the wish to remove suffering.
11. **No expectation**: *Upekṣā* (equanimity) is defined here as action without attachment to fruit (*phala*).
12. **Tathāgata's merit**: The true refuge is not a place or a deity, but the accumulated merit of the Buddha-nature, which transcends birth and death.
13. **The body is the root**: A surprising turn. Vimalakirti traces the chain of causation backwards: wholesome/unwholesome karma depends on having a body to act.
14. **False discrimination**: *Vikalpa*. The root of desire is the mind's tendency to bifurcate reality into subject/object, good/bad.
15. **Non-abiding** (*apratisṭhāna*): The ultimate ground. If thought relies on discrimination, and discrimination relies on inversion, inversion relies on... nothing. There is no foundation. This is the "rootless root."
16. **All dharmas are established**: Because there is no fixed ground (emptiness), infinite possibilities (dependent origination) can be established.
17. **Habit-energies** (*vāsanā*): The latent tendencies or "perfuming" left by past kamma. Even if intellectual defilements are cut, these subtle emotional habits remain—symbolized by the flowers sticking.
18. **Is liberation that old?**: A sharp rebuke of Śāriputra's linear time concept. Liberation is outside time; asking "how long" is a category error.
19. **Nature of desire... is liberation**: A radical Tantric/Vajrayana precursor. Defilements are not to be abandoned but seen into. Their essential nature (*svabhāva*) is empty, hence liberated.
20. **Other lands**: The room is a cosmic portal, connected to the multiverse of Buddhas.
21. **Secret and essential Dharma-treasure**: Refers to teachings on the Tathāgatagarbha or ultimate emptiness, often reserved for advanced bodhisattvas.
22. **Transform your female body**: Śāriputra assumes the female form is inferior and a result of bad karma, reflecting traditional Indian social views.
23. **I do not know how**: Śāriputra's confusion highlights the fluidity of form. "He" is now "she," proving that gender is a performance, not an essence.
24. **Neither male nor female**: A definitive statement on the emptiness of gender. Enlightenment is sexless.
25. **Sentient beings are likewise**: Just as a magical creation doesn't truly die because it was never truly born, so too beings.

### Key Philosophical Concepts

**The Goddess (Devatā)**:
The appearance of the goddess marks a pivot in the sutra. She is not a disciple but a fully enlightened presence equal to Vimalakirti. Her gender is utilized as a skillful means (*upāya*) to smash Śāriputra's residual dualistic thinking. She represents **Prajñā** (Wisdom), traditionally personified as female (Prauñāpāramitā creates all Buddhas, hence "Mother of Buddhas"), demonstrating that wisdom transcends social and biological categories.

**The "Sticky" Flowers**:
A brilliant metaphor for **attachment** (*upādāna*) versus **liberation**. The flowers are neutral phenomena. They "stick" only where there is an emotional hook—in this case, the disciples' fear of samsara and desire for purity. The bodhisattvas, having no fear and no concept of "pure/impure," offer no surface for the flowers to adhere to. This teaches that the problem is not the object (flower/world), but the mind's reactvity.

**Non-Abiding (Apratisṭhāna)**:
Vimalakirti's "genealogy of confusion" ends with "Non-abiding." This is the abyss of Emptiness. It is not that confusion comes from a mistake; confusion comes from the groundlessness of reality itself. However, Vimalakirti flips this: precisely *because* there is no static foundation, everything can arise. Form is Emptiness; Emptiness is Form.

### Cross-References

-   **Lotus Sūtra, Ch. 12 (Devadatta)**: The Dragon Girl transforms into a male to attain Buddhahood. The Vimalakirti Sutra critiques this by having the goddess *refuse* to transform, arguing that "female" is already empty. It is a more advanced feminist critique than the Lotus.
-   **Heart Sutra**: "No eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind." The goddess echoes this negation of fixed characteristics.
-   **Diamond Sutra**: "Whether they be born from eggs, from wombs... I lead them all to Nirvana without remainder." Compare with "Compassion without object."
-   **Mādhyamakakārikā (Nāgārjuna), Ch. 25**: "Nirvana is not different from Samsara." The goddess's teaching that "desire, anger, delusion are liberation" is pure Mādhyamaka.
