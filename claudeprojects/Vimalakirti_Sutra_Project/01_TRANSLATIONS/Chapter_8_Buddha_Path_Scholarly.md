# Chapter 8: The Buddha Path (佛道品)

## The Non-Path as the Path

At that time, Mañjuśrī asked Vimalakirti: "How does a bodhisattva penetrate the Buddha Path?"¹

Vimalakirti said: "If a bodhisattva travels the non-path (*amārga*), this is penetrating the Buddha Path."

Again he asked: "How does a bodhisattva travel the non-path?"

He answered: "If a bodhisattva performs the five deadly sins but feels no vexation or anger; goes to hell but is without sin or defilement; goes to the animal realm but is without ignorance or arrogance; goes to the hungry ghost realm but is endowed with merit; travels the paths of the form and formless realms but does not consider them superior.²

"Showing the practice of desire, yet separated from all attachment. Showing the practice of anger, yet having no aversion towards sentient beings. Showing the practice of ignorance, yet taming the mind with wisdom. Showing the practice of stinginess, yet giving away all internal and external possessions, not begrudging body or life. Showing the practice of breaking precepts, yet abiding peacefully in pure precepts, fearing even small faults. Showing the practice of anger [hatred], yet constantly compassionate and patient. Showing the practice of laziness, yet diligently cultivating merit. Showing the practice of distracted mind, yet constantly mindful and concentrated. Showing the practice of stupidity, yet penetrating worldly and supramundane wisdom.

"Showing the practice of flattery and deception, yet observing relationships with skillful means according to the scriptures. Showing the practice of arrogance, yet serving as a bridge for sentient beings. Showing the practice of all afflictions, yet the mind is constantly pure. Showing entry into the host of demons [*Māra*], yet conforming to Buddha-wisdom and not following other teachings. Showing entry into the śrāvaka [path], yet expounding unheard Dharma for sentient beings. Showing entry into the pratyekabuddha [path], yet achieving great compassion and converting sentient beings.

"Showing entry into poverty, yet having a jewel-hand,³ with inexhaustible merit. Showing entry into disability, yet possessing perfect marks and characteristics to adorn oneself. Showing entry into low status, yet born into the Buddha-family, endowed with merit. Showing entry into weakness/ugliness, yet obtaining the Nārāyaṇa-body,⁴ delightful to all beings. Showing entry into old age and sickness, yet eternally cutting off the root of sickness and transcending the fear of death.

"Showing the possession of livelihood, yet constantly observing impermanence and truly having no greed. Showing the possession of wives, concubines, and waiting women, yet constantly distanced from the mud of the five desires. Manifesting dullness, yet achieving eloquence and dhāraṇī without loss. Showing entry into heterodox paths, yet saving sentient beings with the orthodox path. Manifesting entry into all paths, yet cutting off their causes and conditions. Manifesting nirvāṇa, yet not cutting off birth and death.

"Mañjuśrī! If the bodhisattva can thus travel the non-path, this is called penetrating the Buddha Path."

## The Seed of the Tathāgata

Then Vimalakirti asked Mañjuśrī: "What is the seed (*gotra*) of the Tathāgata?"⁵

Mañjuśrī said: "The body is the seed. Ignorance and craving are the seed. Greed, anger, and delusion are the seed. The four inversions are the seed. The five hindrances are the seed. The six sense-entrances are the seed. The seven abodes of consciousness are the seed. The eight wrong constructs are the seed. The nine abodes of vexation are the seed. The ten unwholesome paths are the seed. To speak essentially: the sixty-two views and all afflictions (*kleśa*)—these are all the Buddha-seed."

He [Vimalakirti] asked: "What does this mean?"

He [Mañjuśrī] answered: "If one sees the unconditioned (*asaṃskṛta*) and enters the fixed determination [of the Arhat], one cannot generate the mind of *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*. For example, lotuses do not grow on the high plateau of dry land; they grow in the mud of the damp lowlands.⁶ Just so, one who sees the unconditioned dharma and enters fixed determination will never again happen to generate the Buddha-dharma. Only within the mud of afflictions do sentient beings raise the Buddha-dharma!

"Again, like planting seeds in the sky—they will never grow. Only in manure-enriched earth can they flourish. Like this, one who enters the unconditioned fixed determination does not generate the Buddha-dharma. One who gives rise to the view of self as great as Mount Sumeru can still generate the mind of *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi* and produce the Buddha-dharma!

"Therefore, you should know that all afflictions are the seed of the Tathāgata. For example, if one does not descend into the great ocean, one cannot obtain the priceless pearl. Like this, if one does not enter the great ocean of afflictions, one cannot obtain the jewel of All-Knowledge (*sarvajñā*)."

## Mahākāśyapa's Lament

At that time, Mahākāśyapa praised this, saying: "Excellent, excellent, Mañjuśrī! You speak these words well. Truly, as you say, the dusty laborers [those with afflictions] are the seed of the Tathāgata. We today are no longer capable of generating the mind of *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*. Even those with the five deadly sins can still generate the intention to produce the Buddha-dharma, but we will eternally be unable to generate it.

"For example, like a person with damaged faculties, for whom the five desires yield no benefit; likewise, the śrāvakas who have cut off bonds have no further benefit in the Buddha-dharma and eternally have no aspiration. Therefore, Mañjuśrī! The ordinary person has a reversibility in the Buddha-dharma, but the śrāvaka does not. Why? Upon hearing the Buddha-dharma, the ordinary person can raise the unexcelled Way-mind and not cut off the Three Jewels. Even if the śrāvaka hears the Buddha-dharma, the powers, and fearlessnesses until the end of their life, they can never generate the unexcelled Way-intention."

## The Bodhisattva's Family

At that time, a bodhisattva in the assembly named Universal Manifestation of Physical Form asked Vimalakirti: "Layman! Who are your parents, wife and children, relatives, retinue, officials, and acquaintances? Where are your pages, maids, elephants, horses, and carriages?"

Then Vimalakirti answered with verses:⁷

" Wisdom-perfection (*prajñā-pāramitā*) is the Bodhisattva’s Mother,
Skillful means (*upāya*) is the Father;
All the Guides of the multitude (Buddhas)
Are born from nothing other than these.

Dharma-joy is the wife,
Compassion (*karuṇā*) and kindness (*maitrī*) are the daughters,
Good mind and sincerity are the sons,
Ultimate emptiness and tranquility is the house.

The dust of sensory objects are the disciples,
Turning according to will;
The factors of awakening (*bodhipakṣika-dharma*) are the good friends,
By these one achieves Correct Awakening.

The paramitas are the Dharma-companions,
The four means of attraction (*saṃgraha-vastu*) are the dancing girls,
Singing and chanting Dharma-words,
Using this for music.

The garden is Retention (*dhāraṇī*),
The forest trees are the taintless (*anāsrava*) dharmas,
The flowers are the seven branches of awakening,
The fruit is the wisdom of liberation.

The bathing pool is the Eight Liberations,
Filled with the clear water of concentration (*samādhi*),
Scattered with the seven pure flowers,⁸
Bathing this stainless person.

Elephants and horses are the five penetrations galloping,
The Great Vehicle (*Mahāyāna*) is the carriage,
Controlled by the one mind,
Roaming the Eightfold Noble Path.

Dignified appearance consists of the marks,
The secondary marks adorn the form,
Shame (*hrī*) and scruple (*apatrāpya*) are the upper content,
Deep mind (*adhyāśaya*) is the garland.

Wealth consists of the Seven Dharma Treasures,
Teaching and instructing essentially increases interest,
Practicing according to what is said,
Merit-transfer (*pariṇāmanā*) is the great profit.

The four dhyānas are the seat/bed,
Born from pure livelihood,
Much learning (*bāhuśrutya*) increases wisdom,
This is the sound of self-awakening.

The food is the ambrosia of Dharma,
The drink is the flavor of liberation,
The bath is the pure mind,
Ranking discipline (*śīla*) is the unguent.

Destroying the thief of afflictions,
Heroic vigor none can surpass,
Subduing the four kinds of Māra,
The victory banner establishes the Way-place (*bodhimaṇḍa*).

Though knowing no arising or cessation,
Showing existence for their sake;
Totally manifesting in all lands,
Like the sun which is seen everywhere.

Offering to the Buddhas of the ten directions,
Immeasurable millions of Tathāgatas,
Between the Buddhas and oneself,
There is no thought of distinction.

Though knowing Buddha-lands
And sentient beings are empty,
Constantly cultivating the Pure Land,
Teaching and converting the multitude.

Whatever types of sentient beings,
Shapes, sounds, and deportments,
The fearless-power Bodhisattva,
Can manifest them all at once.

Awakening to the affairs of Māra,
Yet manifesting behavior that follows them;
With the wisdom of skillful means,
Able to appear perfectly at will.

Sometimes showing old age, sickness, death,
To accomplish sentient beings;
Understanding visions as illusory,
Penetrating without obstruction.

Sometimes manifesting the aeon-ending fire,
Heaven and earth entirely ablaze,
For the multitudes who possess the thought of permanence,
Illuminating to make them know impermanence.

Countless millions of beings,
All come to invite the Bodhisattva,
Arriving at his house at one time,
He transforms them to the Buddha-Way.

Scriptures, spells, and magic arts,
Technical skills and all arts,
Fully manifesting the practice of these things,
To bring benefit to the multitudes.

All the Daoist/worldly methods of the world,
Renouncing the home life within them all,
Using this to untie people's confusion,
While not falling into wrong views.

Sometimes serving as Sun, Moon, Heaven,
Brahma King, or World Lord (Indra),
Sometimes serving as Earth or Water,
Or again serving as Wind or Fire.⁹

During aeons of sickness and plague,
Manifesting as medicinal herbs,
If there are those who take them,
Sickness is removed and poison purged.

During aeons of famine,
Manifesting body as food and drink,
First saving them from hunger and thirst,
Then speaking Dharma to the people.

During aeons of swords and soldiers (war),
Generating kindness and compassion for them,
Transforming those sentient beings,
Causing them to dwell in the land of zero conflict.

If there are great battles,
Standing equal in strength to both sides,
The Bodhisattva manifests authority,
Subduing them to bring harmony and peace.

In all lands,
Wherever there are hells,
Instantly going to them,
Relieving their suffering and distress.

In all lands,
Where animals eat one another,
Manifesting birth there,
To create benefit for them.

Demonstrating the enjoyment of the five desires,
Also manifesting the practice of dhyāna,
Causing the devil's mind to be confused,
Unable to gain the advantage.

A lotus growing in the fire,
This can be called rare;
Practicing dhyāna while in desire,
Is rare just like this.

Sometimes manifesting as a prostitute,
Attracting those who love form (sex),
First hooking them with desire,
Later causing them to enter Buddha-wisdom.¹⁰

Sometimes serving as village magistrate,
Or as a guide for merchants,
National teacher and high minister,
To protect and benefit beings.

For those who are destitute,
Manifesting as an inexhaustible treasury,
Using this to encourage and guide,
Causing them to generate the Bodhi-mind.

For those whose minds are arrogant,
Manifesting as a powerful wrestler,
Subduing all haughtiness,
Causing them to dwell in the Unsurpassed Way.

For those multitudes who are fearful,
Standing before them to comfort,
First giving them fearlessness (*abhaya-dāna*),
Later causing them to generate the Way-mind.

Sometimes manifesting separation from desire,
Becoming a five-penetration sage (rishi),
Guiding the multitudes,
Causing them to dwell in precepts, patience, kindness.

Seeing those requiring service,
Manifesting as a servant/slave,
Once having pleased their mind,
Generating the Way-mind.

According to whatever they need,
Entering the Buddha-way,
With the power of skillful means,
Able to supply it all.

Like this the Way is immeasurable,
The practice has no boundary,
Wisdom has no limit,
Liberating countless multitudes.

Even if all Buddhas,
For immeasurable millions of aeons,
Praised his merit,
They could not exhaust it.

Who, hearing such Dharma,
Would not generate the Bodhi-mind?
Except for those unworthy people,
Those stupid, dark, and wisdom-less ones."

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Footnotes

1.  **Penetrate the Buddha Path**: *Buddha-mārga-avatāra*. The question sets up a paradox: usually one enters a path by following rules. Here, penetration comes from the "non-path" (*amārga*).
2.  **Not consider them superior**: The bodhisattva traverses all realms of existence, including hells and heavens, without attachment or judgment.
3.  **Jewel-hand**: Symbolizes the capacity to bestow spiritual wealth despite material poverty.
4.  **Nārāyaṇa-body**: A body as strong as Nārāyaṇa (a form of Vishnu/Hercules figure in Buddhism), representing physical resilience earned through merit.
5.  **Seed of the Tathāgata**: *Tathāgata-gotra*. Usually "seed" implies purity/Buddha-nature. Mañjuśrī radically redefines the seed as *defilement*. Without the manure of passion, the lotus of enlightenment cannot grow.
6.  **Mud of the damp lowlands**: A famous metaphor. The "high plateau" represents the sterile purity of the Arhat/Pratyekabuddha who has cut off desire. The "swamp" is the mess of samsara where Bodhisattvas thrive.
7.  **Verses**: These *gāthās* summarize the "Family of the Tathāgata," redefining worldly relations into spiritual qualities.
8.  **Seven pure flowers**: Often refers to the seven factors of awakening or seven constituents of the path.
9.  **Wind or Fire**: The Bodhisattva becomes the elements themselves to sustain life.
10. **Hooking them with desire**: *Upāya* logic. The "hook" (*agra*) draws beings in via their attachments, then transforms them.

### Definitions and Concepts

*   **Non-Path (Amārga)**: The paradoxical practice of delving into the profane (anger, greed, heresy) to transform it. It differs from indulgence because the bodhisattva maintains "mindful detachment" throughout.
*   **Sixty-two views**: The standard list of wrong views (eternalism, nihilism, etc.) regarding the self and the world found in the Brahma-jala Sutra.
*   **Gotra (Lineage/Seed)**: Mañjuśrī argues that the "lineage" of the Buddha is not the pious monk, but the passionate being who transmutes suffering into wisdom.
