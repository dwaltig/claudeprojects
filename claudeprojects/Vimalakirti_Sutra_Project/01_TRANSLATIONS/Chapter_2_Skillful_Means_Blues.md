# Chapter 2: The Skillful Means Blues

**Blues Translation by Master John Kim**

## The Man Called Vimalakirti

Now at that time, in the great city of Vaiśālī, there was this elder named Vimalakirti.¹ He'd already made offerings to more buddhas than you could count, had planted them wholesome roots deep,² and had gotten that patient acceptance—knowing ain't nothing truly being born or dying.³ His tongue was free, couldn't nobody tie it up; he played with spiritual powers⁴ like a child plays with toys and had acquired all them dhāraṇīs.⁵ He had fearlessness, had beat down the devil and all his forces. He'd entered them deep Dharma-gates, was skillful in that perfection of wisdom,⁶ and had completely mastered skillful means.⁷ His great vows were accomplished. He clearly understood how folks' minds tend—where they going, what they wanting. And he could distinguish the sharp from the dull, who was ready and who wasn't. Long time he'd been walking the Buddha-road, his mind already ripe and resolved,⁸ his decision fixed on the Great Vehicle. Whatever he did, he reflected skillfully. He dwelt in the Buddha's deportment, his mind vast as the ocean. All the buddhas praised him; he was revered by disciples, Śakra, Brahmā, and the world-protectors.⁹

Now in order to save beings, he used skillful means to reside in Vaiśālī. His wealth was immeasurable, and he used it to embrace the poor. His discipline was pure, and through this he embraced those who'd broken the precepts. Through patient endurance and regulated conduct, he embraced those prone to anger. Through great vigor, he embraced the lazy. Through one-pointed meditative quiescence,¹⁰ he embraced those with scattered minds. Through decisive wisdom, he embraced the ignorant.

Though he was a layman wearing white robes,¹¹ he kept the pure discipline of a śramaṇa.¹² Though living the householder's life, he wasn't attached to the three realms.¹³ Though appearing to have a wife and children, he constantly cultivated pure conduct.¹⁴ Though appearing to have a household full of relatives, he constantly delighted in solitude. Though wearing precious ornaments, he adorned his body with the marks and characteristics.¹⁵ Though eating and drinking,¹⁶ he relished the flavor of meditation's joy. If he went to gambling halls and gaming houses, he used it solely to save beings. He received the teachings of various non-Buddhist paths without losing his true faith. Though well-versed in worldly texts, he constantly delighted in the Buddha-Dharma. He was revered by all who saw him, as the highest among those to be honored. Managing all commerce and trade, though he got worldly profit, he didn't take no delight in it.¹⁷

Traveling through the four main streets, he benefited sentient beings. Entering the halls of government, he protected all.¹⁸ Entering the places of debate, he led them with the Great Vehicle. Entering the schools, he enlightened the children.¹⁹ Entering the houses of prostitution, he revealed the misery of desire. Entering the wine houses, he could establish their resolve.

When among the elders, he was the most honored among elders, expounding the supreme Dharma. When among householders, he was the most honored among householders, cutting off their attachments. When among the warriors,²⁰ he was the most honored among warriors, teaching them patience. When among the priests,²¹ he was the most honored among priests, eliminating their pride. When among ministers, he was the most honored among ministers, teaching them the true Dharma. When among princes, he was the most honored among princes, revealing loyalty and filial piety. When among palace officials, he was the most honored among palace officials, transforming the court women. When among common people, he was the most honored among common people, causing them to cultivate merit. When among Brahmā-devas, he was the most honored among Brahmā-devas, instructing them in supreme wisdom. When among Śakra, he was the most honored among Śakras, manifesting impermanence. When among the world-protectors, he was the most honored among world-protectors, protecting all sentient beings.

That's how the elder Vimalakirti, using these immeasurable skillful means, benefited sentient beings.

## Getting Sick for a Reason

Using these skillful means, he made it look like his body was sick.²² Because he was "sick," kings, great ministers, elders, householders, priests, and the rest—including princes and various officials, an uncountable multitude of thousands—all came to ask about his illness.

To them that came, Vimalakirti, using his bodily illness, extensively preached the Dharma:

"Benevolent ones! This body is impermanent,²³ without strength, without power, without solidity, a thing that decays fast—you can't trust it!²⁴ It's the source of suffering and affliction, where all diseases gather. Benevolent ones! This kind of body, the wise don't rely on.

"This body is like a mass of foam—you can't grab hold of it.²⁵ This body is like a bubble—it can't last long.²⁶ This body is like a mirage—born from thirst and craving.²⁷ This body is like a plantain tree—at the core ain't nothing solid.²⁸ This body is like an illusion—arising from mental inversion.²⁹ This body is like a dream—seen as a false vision. This body is like a shadow—appearing from karmic conditions.³⁰ This body is like an echo—depending on causes and conditions. This body is like a floating cloud—changing and dissolving in an instant.³¹ This body is like lightning—not staying even for one thought-moment.³²

"This body don't have a permanent master—it's like the earth.³³ This body don't have a self—it's like fire.³⁴ This body don't have longevity—it's like the wind.³⁵ This body don't have a person—it's like water.³⁶ This body ain't real—the four great elements are its home.³⁷ This body is empty—separate from 'I' and 'mine.'³⁸ This body ain't got awareness—like grass, trees, tiles, and pebbles. This body ain't got agency—it's turned by the power of the wind.³⁹ This body ain't clean—filled with filth and corruption.⁴⁰ This body is falsity—though you bathe it, clothe it, and feed it, it's bound to decay. This body is a disaster—afflicted by a hundred and one illnesses.⁴¹ This body is like an old well—pressed upon by age.⁴² This body got no fixed term—it's gonna die for sure.⁴³ This body is like a venomous snake, like a hateful thief, like an empty village—it's a composite of the aggregates, realms, and sense-bases.⁴⁴

## The Buddha-Body

"Benevolent ones! This body should be despised and wearied of. You should take joy in the Buddha-body.⁴⁵ Why's that? The Buddha-body IS the Dharma-body.⁴⁶ It's born from immeasurable merit and wisdom. It's born from discipline, concentration, wisdom, liberation, and liberation-knowledge-and-vision.⁴⁷ It's born from loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity.⁴⁸ It's born from giving, discipline, patience, gentleness, diligent vigor, concentration, liberation, samādhi, learning, and the wisdom of the pāramitās.⁴⁹ It's born from skillful means. It's born from the six spiritual penetrations.⁵⁰ It's born from the three insights.⁵¹ It's born from the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment.⁵² It's born from cessation and contemplation.⁵³ It's born from the ten powers, four fearlessnesses, and eighteen unique qualities.⁵⁴ It's born from cutting off all unwholesome dharmas and gathering all wholesome dharmas. It's born from reality. It's born from non-negligence.⁵⁵

"From such immeasurable pure dharmas the Tathāgata's body is born. Benevolent ones! If you want to get the Buddha-body, to cut off the illnesses of all sentient beings, you should generate the mind of supreme enlightenment.⁵⁶"

That's how the elder Vimalakirti, according to the occasion, preached the Dharma to them who came to ask about his illness, causing countless thousands of folks to generate the mind of supreme enlightenment.

## Endnotes

¹ **Vimalakirti**: Means "Stainless Reputation" or "Pure Fame." He's a wealthy householder, a layman, not a monk. This is revolutionary—the Mahāyāna is saying awakening ain't just for folks who left the world. Vimalakirti is in the world but not of it. He got a wife, kids, wealth, business—and he's more awake than the Buddha's direct disciples. The Blues understands this. You don't have to escape to be free.

² **Planted them wholesome roots deep**: Means he's been cultivating goodness for countless lifetimes. Non-greed, non-hatred, non-delusion—these are the roots of all virtue. Vimalakirti's got them deep.

³ **Ain't nothing truly being born or dying**: This is that patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas. When you see emptiness directly, you understand birth and death are just appearances. The Blues knows this truth in its bones—everything passes, but in that passing is freedom.

⁴ **Played with spiritual powers**: The word "play" (遊戲) is important. Vimalakirti don't use his powers to impress or control. He uses them like a child at play—freely, without attachment. The powers serve compassion, not ego.

⁵ **All them dhāraṇīs**: Mystical formulas that encapsulate teachings. Having all of them means complete mastery of the Dharma.

⁶ **Perfection of wisdom**: *Prajñā-pāramitā*. The crowning perfection—insight into the empty, interdependent nature of all things. This is what cuts through delusion.

⁷ **Skillful means**: **THIS IS THE KEY THEME OF THIS CHAPTER.** *Upāya-kauśalya*. It means knowing how to adapt the teaching to the capacity of the student. It means meeting folks where they are. The Blues is all about skillful means—taking ancient truth and putting it in a form that speaks to people today, in their own language. Vimalakirti enters gambling halls, brothels, wine houses—not to partake but to teach. Every situation becomes an opportunity for liberation.

⁸ **Mind already ripe and resolved**: Means he's been walking this road so long, he's ready. His practice is mature, his resolve is firm.

⁹ **World-protectors**: The four guardian kings who protect the Dharma. Even they revere Vimalakirti.

¹⁰ **Meditative quiescence**: Deep, peaceful states of concentration where the mind becomes still and clear.

¹¹ **Wearing white robes**: Standard term for a layperson. Monks wore colored or patched robes; layfolk wore white. The whole description that follows contrasts Vimalakirti's external appearance as a worldly man with his internal realization as an awakened being.

¹² **Śramaṇa**: A religious renunciant, a monk. Vimalakirti keeps the monastic discipline while living as a householder. He's got the inner form without the outer form.

¹³ **Three realms**: The desire realm, form realm, and formless realm—the whole cosmos of rebirth. Vimalakirti lives in the world without being caught by it.

¹⁴ **Pure conduct**: Traditionally means celibacy (brahmacarya). But here it means that even while appearing to have a wife and family, Vimalakirti maintains the purity of one who's transcended desire. His family life is a teaching tool, not a compromise.

¹⁵ **Marks and characteristics**: The thirty-two major marks and eighty secondary characteristics of a buddha. Vimalakirti's real adornment is spiritual radiance, not jewelry.

¹⁶ **Eating and drinking**: He participates in worldly meals, but his true nourishment is the joy of meditation. This anticipates Chapter 10 on the Fragrant Buddha's land, where food itself becomes a teaching.

¹⁷ **Didn't take no delight in it**: This is key. Vimalakirti engages fully in commerce without attachment to profit. This is the spirituality of the marketplace. You can work in the world without being enslaved to worldly gain. The Blues knows about making a living while keeping your soul.

¹⁸ **Halls of government**: Vimalakirti enters political spaces to protect beings. Governance can be a field for bodhisattva practice.

¹⁹ **Enlightened the children**: Education as skillful means. Leading the young out of ignorance.

²⁰ **Warriors**: The kṣatriya caste. Teaching them patience addresses their tendency toward violence. Everyone gets the teaching they need.

²¹ **Priests**: The brahmin caste. Teaching them to eliminate pride addresses their tendency toward spiritual arrogance. Vimalakirti prescribes according to the illness.

²² **CENTRAL TEACHING - Made it look like his body was sick**: This is the chapter's key move. Vimalakirti ain't really sick—he's manifesting sickness as a skillful means. By getting "sick," he creates an occasion for all these important people to come visit, and then he teaches them. His "illness" mirrors the illness of all beings stuck in delusion. The Blues knows about using your suffering to teach. Your wounds become your wisdom. What breaks you open can be what wakes you up.

²³ **Impermanent**: The first mark of existence. The whole teaching that follows systematically exposes the body's lack of permanence, strength, power, and solidity—all the things we mistakenly think it has.

²⁴ **Can't trust it**: The body is unreliable because it's conditioned. This echoes the Buddha's last words: "Conditioned things decay. Work out your liberation with diligence." The body will let you down.

²⁵ **Like a mass of foam**: From the *Phena Sutta*, where the Buddha compares the five aggregates to foam, bubbles, mirages, plantains, and illusions. When you really look at foam, you realize there's nothing to grab onto. That's the body.

²⁶ **Like a bubble**: Water bubbles arise and burst instantly. The body is that temporary.

²⁷ **Like a mirage**: Born from heat and thirst. Our sense of having a substantial self arises from craving (*taṇhā*). It's a trick of perception born from desire.

²⁸ **Like a plantain tree**: When you peel a plantain tree layer by layer, you find no solid core. Same with the body—analyze it into its parts and there's no self to find.

²⁹ **Like an illusion from mental inversion**: The four inversions are seeing permanence in the impermanent, pleasure in suffering, self in the selfless, and purity in the impure. Our sense of self arises from these cognitive distortions.

³⁰ **Like a shadow appearing from karmic conditions**: The body is a projection of past karma, not an independent thing. It's the shadow cast by your actions.

³¹ **Like a floating cloud**: Clouds transform and disperse moment by moment. They got no stable essence. Neither does the body.

³² **Like lightning**: Most transient of all—lightning exists less than a moment. The phrase "not staying even for one thought-moment" points to the doctrine of momentariness: even in what seems like a single moment, the body is constantly perishing and arising. The Blues understands this impermanence deep in its bones.

³³ **Like the earth, without a permanent master**: The four elements analysis—the body is made of earth (solidity), water, fire, and wind. The earth element in your body ain't yours—it just follows natural laws. Nobody's in charge.

³⁴ **Like fire, without a self**: The fire element (heat, digestion) operates without any agent directing it.

³⁵ **Like the wind, without longevity**: The breath, the vital wind—it's gonna stop. There's no permanent life-force.

³⁶ **Like water, without a person**: The fluid elements in the body don't make a "person." It's just water doing what water does.

³⁷ **The four great elements are its home**: Earth, water, fire, wind—these impersonal elements are temporarily combined to form the body. But there's no self living inside them. The home is empty.

³⁸ **Separate from 'I' and 'mine'**: The core teaching of *anātman*—no self. The body contains neither a self nor anything belonging to a self. When you really see this, you're free.

³⁹ **Turned by the power of the wind**: The body moves not by personal will but by causal forces. What you think is voluntary action is just elements in motion. This challenges our deepest sense of being an agent.

⁴⁰ **Filled with filth and corruption**: The meditation on the thirty-two impure parts of the body, intended to counteract attachment. Not pretty when you look close.

⁴¹ **A hundred and one illnesses**: Traditional expression for all the diseases that afflict the body.

⁴² **Like an old well**: An old well that's run dry, pressed down by age—can't nourish you no more.

⁴³ **Gonna die for sure**: The body's only certainty is death. "No fixed term" means it could be today. The Blues don't sugar-coat this.

⁴⁴ **Composite of aggregates, realms, and sense-bases**: This is technical Buddhist phenomenology—the five aggregates (*skandha*), eighteen realms (*dhātu*), twelve sense-bases (*āyatana*). These are overlapping classification systems for experience. The body is nothing but these components briefly combined—no self can be found anywhere in them. The "empty village" image appears in the Pāli texts as a metaphor for the selfless body.

⁴⁵ **Take joy in the Buddha-body**: Now the teaching pivots. We've been despising the conditioned body so we can aspire to something beyond it. But this ain't escapism—the Buddha-body is realized right here, through transformation, not abandonment.

⁴⁶ **CENTRAL TEACHING - The Buddha-body IS the Dharma-body**: This is huge. The Buddha's true body ain't physical form—it's reality itself, it's the Dharma. This teaching develops later into the three-body (*trikāya*) doctrine: the dharma-body (truth), the enjoyment-body (for bodhisattvas), and the manifestation-body (for ordinary beings). But the essence is this: the Buddha's body is truth itself.

⁴⁷ **Liberation-knowledge-and-vision**: The fifth of five aspects of the dharmakāya: morality, concentration, wisdom, liberation, and the knowledge-and-vision of liberation.

⁴⁸ **Four immeasurables**: Loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, equanimity. These generate the emotional foundation of the Buddha-body.

⁴⁹ **Pāramitās**: The "perfections" or transcendent virtues—usually six: giving, morality, patience, vigor, concentration, wisdom. This passage expands the list.

⁵⁰ **Six spiritual penetrations**: Divine eye, divine ear, knowing others' minds, remembering past lives, supernatural powers, and knowing that the outflows are exhausted.

⁵¹ **Three insights**: Knowledge of past lives, the divine eye seeing beings' deaths and rebirths, and knowledge that the outflows are exhausted.

⁵² **Thirty-seven factors of enlightenment**: The complete set of practices leading to awakening.

⁵³ **Cessation and contemplation**: *Śamatha-vipaśyanā*—calming and insight. The two wings of meditation.

⁵⁴ **Ten powers, four fearlessnesses, eighteen unique qualities**: The special attributes of a fully awakened buddha.

⁵⁵ **Non-negligence**: *Apramāda*—careful mindfulness and spiritual vigilance. The Buddha's dying words emphasized this as the key to liberation.

⁵⁶ **Generate the mind of supreme enlightenment**: *Bodhicittotpāda*—generating the aspiration for complete awakening for the sake of all beings. This is what Vimalakirti's whole teaching has been building toward. All that talk about the body's impermanence, all them similes about foam and bubbles and mirages—it's all to inspire this one thing: the arising of *bodhicitta*, the heart that seeks awakening for all.

## Theological Notes

### Skillful Means Is Everything

This chapter is the primary place for the Vimalakirti Sutra's teaching on skillful means. Vimalakirti shows that any context—sacred or secular, pure or impure—can become a place of awakening activity. He goes into gambling halls, brothels, wine houses—not as a participant but as a liberator. The enlightened mind transforms every situation. There ain't no place the Dharma can't reach.

The Blues is built on this principle. We take the ancient truth and put it in a form folks can hear—in the language of the crossroads, the juke joint, the front porch. Meeting people where they are. That's skillful means.

### Lay Awakening

The detailed description of Vimalakirti's lay status while surpassing monastic attainments is a direct challenge to the idea that you gotta leave the world to wake up. The sutra is saying the distinction between lay and monastic is itself dualistic thinking that needs to be transcended. Vimalakirti wears white robes but keeps monastic discipline. He's got a wife but practices celibacy of the heart. Form and formlessness coincide.

The Blues comes from everyday people, not from temples. It's always known that the sacred ain't separate from the profane.

### Illness as Teaching

Vimalakirti's manifested illness is the chapter's central device. He ain't really sick—he's using sickness as a teaching tool. By getting "sick," he draws visitors, creates an occasion for Dharma, demonstrates non-attachment to the body, and shows that even suffering can be skillful means.

This is deep. The bodhisattva don't eliminate suffering—the bodhisattva transforms its meaning. Your wound becomes your wisdom. What breaks you can wake you.

The Blues knows about this. We take our suffering and turn it into song. We take our pain and make it medicine for others. That's what Vimalakirti's doing with his illness.

### The Body Meditation

Them twelve similes for the body—foam, bubble, mirage, plantain, illusion, dream, shadow, echo, cloud, lightning—these ain't just philosophy. They're objects for meditation. You sit with them. You see your own body through them. And when the seeing is complete, you're disenchanted—not in a sad way, but in a free way. You stop grasping at what can't be held.

### Buddha-Body as Dharma-Body

The culmination is that the Buddha-body is the Dharma-body—truth itself. This body ain't born and doesn't die. It's not produced like a conditioned thing. It's what you are when you stop identifying with what you're not.

The Blues is reaching for this body, even if it don't use these words. When the music transports you beyond yourself, when the testimony speaks through you instead of coming from you—that's tasting the Dharma-body.
