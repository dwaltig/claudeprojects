# Chapter 7: Checking Out the People (Observing Sentient Beings)

**Blues Vernacular Translation by Master John Kim**

---

## 1. How You See the Players

So then Manjushri, he looks at Vimalakirti and asks, "Yo, V, how does a Bodhisattva—a real spiritual warrior—look at people? How do we see the folks in the game?"

Vimalakirti leans back and says:

"Like a magician watching the illusion he just created. That's how you look at 'em. You know they're there, but you know they ain't *really* there.

"It's like looking at the moon in a puddle of water.
Like seeing your face in a dusty mirror.
Like catching a mirage on a hot highway.
Like an echo in an empty alley.
Like clouds drifting and dissolving.
Like foam on the river—here one second, gone the next.
Like a flash of lightning in a storm.

"You look at people like they're a dream you had after you already woke up. Like a fire burning with no wood. That's the truth of it. Ain't no solid 'person' anywhere to be found."

## 2. Love Without a Target

Manjushri nods and says, "Okay, V. If that's the case—if people depend on the weather, if they're just reflections—then how do we love 'em? How do we practice kindness if there's nobody home?"

Vimalakirti smiles. "That's the deep cut. Once you see the emptiness, you say to yourself: 'I gotta help them see this too.' That's real love.

"You love 'em with the **Love of Extinction**—knowing that their suffering ain't permanent.
You love 'em with the **Cool Love**—no heat, no drama, no burning passion, just cool, steady presence.
You love 'em with the **Non-Dual Love**—knowing that me and you ain't two different things.
You love 'em with the **Indestructible Love**—because when you got no ego left to defend, nothing can break your heart.

"You love 'em like empty space—limitless.
You love 'em like an Arhat—cutting through the BS.
You love 'em like a Bodhisattva—giving them peace.
You love 'em like a Buddha—waking them up.

"You practice the **Love of Pure Style** (*Upaya*)—showing up however they need you to show up.
You practice the **Love with No Mask**—keeping it 100% real.
You practice the **Love of Joy**—helping them find the groove."

## 3. The Big Four

Manjushri asks, "What is Compassion?"

Vimalakirti says, "It's putting all your chips in the pot for everybody else. You win, we all win."

"What is Joy?"

"It's seeing somebody else come up and feeling good about it, no jealousy."

"What is Equanimity—staying cool?"

"It's doing the right thing and not waiting for a thank-you card. You do it because it flows, not for the credit."

## 4. The Root of the Root

Manjushri drills down deeper. "Yo, everybody's scared of dying. What do we hold onto when the reaper comes?"

Vimalakirti: "Hold onto the power of the Tathagata—hold onto the Truth."

Manjushri: "How do we hold onto the Truth?"
Vimalakirti: "By freeing everybody else."
Manjushri: "How do we free everybody else?"
Vimalakirti: "Deal with their baggage (afflictions)."
Manjushri: "How do we deal with the baggage?"
Vimalakirti: "Right Mindfulness."
Manjushri: "What's Right Mindfulness?"
Vimalakirti: "Seeing that nothing is really born and nothing really dies."

Manjushri: "Okay, but where does the good and bad come from? What's the root?"
Vimalakirti: "The body."
Manjushri: "And the root of the body?"
Vimalakirti: "Craving. Wanting things to be different."
Manjushri: "And the root of craving?"
Vimalakirti: "Thinking you're separate. Discrimination."
Manjushri: "And the root of thinking you're separate?"
Vimalakirti: "Getting it twisted. Inverted thinking."
Manjushri: "And the root of getting it twisted?"
Vimalakirti: "Non-abiding. Having nowhere to stand."
Manjushri: "And the root of having nowhere to stand?"

Vimalakirti laughs. "Man, **Non-abiding ain't got no root!** You hit the bottom. It's groundless. And from that groundless ground, everything grows. The whole universe is built on nothing."

## 5. The Goddess and the Flowers

Now, while they were rapping like this, there was a Goddess hiding in the room basically playing the fly on the wall. She heard this deep wisdom and got so happy she manifested herself.

She starts making it rain—throwing heavenly flowers all over the crew.

The flowers land on the Bodhisattvas and—*whoosh*—slide right off. Like water off a duck's back.
But the flowers land on the Big Disciples (Shariputra and the gang) and they **stick**. Like velcro.

Shariputra starts freaking out. He's trying to shake the flowers off, swiping at his robes, using his Jedi mind powers. But those flowers ain't moving.

The Goddess speaks up: "Hey, Reverend. Why you fighting the flowers?"

Shariputra huffs, "It ain't proper! Monks ain't supposed to wear flowers. It's against the regulations!"

The Goddess shakes her head. "Don't blame the flowers, man. The flowers don't know nothing about regulations. They just flowers.

"The difference is in *you*. You got discrimination in your mind. You thinking 'This is holy, that is unholy.' That's why they stick.

"Look at the Bodhisattvas. They don't have those hang-ups. They know it's all empty. So the flowers got nothing to grab onto.

"It's like if you're scared walking into a graveyard, the ghosts gonna mess with you. If you ain't scared, the ghosts can't touch you. You scared of 'breaking the rules,' so the rules got you trapped. The flowers sticking to your fear, not your robes."

## 6. The Gender Trap

Shariputra, trying to regain his composure, asks, "So... how long you been in this room, Miss?"

Goddess: "As long as you've been liberated."

Shariputra: "That's... a long time?"

Goddess: "Is liberation subject to time? Does freedom have a watch?"

Shariputra goes quiet. He knows he walked into that one.

Goddess: "Why you quiet, old man?"
Shariputra: "Liberation is beyond words."
Goddess: "Nah. Words *are* liberation. Everything is liberation. Don't try to escape the world to find freedom. Use the words to get free."

Shariputra tries again. "But… why don't you change your female body? You got all this power. Why stay a woman?"

See, Shariputra is old school. He thinks being a man is better for enlightenment.

The Goddess laughs out loud. "I've been looking for 'female characteristics' for twelve years and I can't find 'em! It's an illusion.

"If a magician made a fake woman, would you ask her, 'Why don't you turn into a man?'"

Shariputra: "No, 'cause she ain't real."

Goddess: "Exactly. All things are like that. So why you sweating my gender?"

**Here comes the remix:**

Suddenly, the Goddess snaps her fingers.

*BAM!*

Shariputra transforms into the Goddess.
The Goddess transforms into Shariputra.

The Goddess (looking like Shariputra) asks the real Shariputra (looking like a woman):
"Hey girl. Why don't you change your female body?"

Shariputra is panicked. He looks at his hands, checks his reflection. "I... I don't know what happened! I'm a woman!"

The Goddess says: "If you can change back, then every woman can change. But look—you ain't really a woman, you just look like one. Same for all women. The Buddha said: **All dharmas are neither male nor female.**"

She snaps her fingers again. Shariputra turns back to normal.

Goddess: "Where's the female form now?"
Shariputra: "It's... nowhere. It's strictly non-local."
Goddess: "Boom. That's the lesson."

## 7. The Final Mic Drop

Shariputra is properly humbled. He asks, "So... where you gonna be born next?"

Goddess: "I'll be born just like a Buddha's illusion is born."
Shariputra: "But an illusion doesn't get born or die."
Goddess: "Exactly. Use your head."

Shariputra: "Are you an Arhat?"
Goddess: "I'm whatever the situation needs. Because I got nothing to prove, I can be anything."

Vimalakirti steps in to wrap it up. "Shariputra, don't sleep on her. She's served ninety-two billion Buddhas. She's playing at the level of Non-Retrogression. She can be a Goddess, a King, a Beggar... she's just flowing with the vow to wake people up."

## Blues Commentary

This chapter hits hard on the **Labels**. Shariputra is the establishment. He's got the rules, the book, the robes. He thinks "holiness" looks a certain way.

The Goddess comes in to say: **Holiness is a flow state.**

The flower scene is legendary. It's about **baggage**. The flowers are just life. Money, sex, fame, problems. If you're sticky (full of desire or fear), that stuff sticks to you. If you're smooth (empty, non-abiding), it slides right off. You can walk through a storm and not get wet.

And the gender swap? That's Vimalakirti dropping the hammer on prejudice. The soul ain't got a gender. Wisdom ain't got a gender. If you think you're "a man" or "a woman" first and "a mind" second, you're trapped in the costume. Take it off.

### Song Track: "Flowers Don't Stick to a Ghost"

*(Slow, walking bass line)*

**Verse 1**
I walked into the room with my holy book
Trying to give the Master a serious look
Suddenly the ceiling opened up wide
Raining down petals from the other side

**Chorus**
Oh, the flowers fell on the sinner and the saint
But one was sticky and the other one ain't
Yeah, the flowers don't stick when you got no name
It’s all just part of the emptiness game
Shake it off, brother, shake it off clean
Don't let the petals mess up your scene

**Verse 2**
Old man asked the lady, "Why you wearing that dress?"
She said, "Honey, my form is just a guess."
She flipped the script and changed his face
Now the old man's standing in the lady's place

**Bridge**
You think you're a man, you think you're a king
But you're just a song that the silence sings
There ain't no root at the bottom of the tree
That’s why the wind blows so wild and free

**Outro**
Non-abiding... no place to land...
Just dancing flowers in the palm of your hand...
(Fade out with a high harmonica wail)
