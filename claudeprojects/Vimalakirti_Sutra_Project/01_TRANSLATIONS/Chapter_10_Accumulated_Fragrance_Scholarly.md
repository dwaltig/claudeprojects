# Chapter 10: Accumulated Fragrance (香積佛品)

**Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel**

## The Request for Food

At that time, Śāriputra thought to himself: "Mealtime is approaching. Where will these bodhisattvas eat?"

Vimalakirti, knowing his thought, said to him: "The Buddha has expounded the Eight Liberations. You, Virtuous One, have received them for practice. How can you mix the desire for food with listening to the Dharma? If you wish to eat, wait a moment. I will cause you to obtain a meal you have never had before."

Then Vimalakirti entered into samādhi and used his supernatural power to show the great assembly a world in the upward direction, passing through forty-two Ganges sands of Buddha-fields. There is a country named **Accumulated Fragrance** (*Gandhavyūha*). The Buddha is named **Fragrance Accumulation** (*Gandhottamakūṭa*), and he exists there now.¹ The fragrance of that country is supreme among all the fragrances of humans and devas in the worlds of the Buddhas of the ten directions.

In that land, there is not even the name of "Śrāvaka" or "Pratyekabuddha"; there is only the pure multitude of great Bodhisattvas, for whom the Buddha speaks the Dharma. In that realm, everything is built of fragrance: towers are made of fragrance, the ground for walking is fragrance, and the gardens are all fragrance. The aroma of their food flows pervasively through immeasurable worlds in the ten directions.

At that time, that Buddha and the bodhisattvas were sitting together eating. There were sons of gods, all named "Fragrance Adornment," who had all generated the mind of *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*, offering distinct alms to that Buddha and the bodhisattvas. Everyone in this [Vimalakirti's] assembly saw this.

Vimalakirti asked the host of bodhisattvas: "Virtuous Ones! Who can bring the rice of that Buddha?"

Because of Mañjuśrī's majestic supernatural power,² everyone remained silent.

Vimalakirti said: "Is this great assembly not ashamed?"

Mañjuśrī said: "As the Buddha has said, do not despise those who have not yet learned."

## The Emanated Bodhisattva

Then, without rising from his seat, Vimalakirti manifested a bodhisattva—whose marks and brilliance were majestic and superior, overshadowing the entire assembly—and told him: "Go in the upward direction. After passing forty-two Ganges sands of Buddha-fields, there is a country named Accumulated Fragrance. The Buddha is named Fragrance Accumulation. He is sitting and eating with the bodhisattvas. Go to where he is and, as I instruct, say: 'Vimalakirti bows his head at the World Honored One's feet, paying measureless respect and inquiring about your health: do you have little illness, little vexation, and is your strength at peace? He wishes to obtain the leftovers of the World Honored One's meal to perform Buddha-work in the Sahā world. This will cause those who delight in the petty Dharma to attain the Great Way, and will cause the name/reputation of the Tathāgata to be universally heard.'"

At that time, the Emanated Bodhisattva ascended upwards in front of the assembly. The whole crowd saw him go. He arrived at the Accumulated Fragrance world and bowed at that Buddha's feet. He repeated the words: "Vimalakirti bows his head at the World Honored One's feet... He wishes to obtain the leftovers of the World Honored One's meal..."

Those Great Beings [in that world] saw the Emanated Bodhisattva and praised this as unprecedented: "Where does this superior person come from? Where is the Sahā world? What is meant by 'those who delight in petty Dharma'?" They asked the Buddha.

That Buddha told them: "In the downward direction, passing forty-two Ganges sands of Buddha-fields, there is a world named Sahā. The Buddha is named Śākyamuni, and he exists now. In the midst of the Five Turbidities³ and the evil world, he expounds the Teaching of the Way for sentient beings who delight in the petty Dharma. There is a bodhisattva there named Vimalakirti, who dwells in the Inconceivable Liberation and speaks Dharma for the bodhisattvas. Therefore, he sent this emanation to praise my name and gaze upon this land, to cause those bodhisattvas to increase their merit."

Those bodhisattvas said: "What kind of person is he, to create such an emanation? His power of virtue and fearlessness, his spiritual feet behave like this!"

The Buddha said: "He is extremely great! In all ten directions, he sends emanations to perform Buddha-work and benefit sentient beings."

Then the Tathāgata Fragrance Accumulation filled a fragrant bowl with fragrant rice and gave it to the Emanated Bodhisattva.

At that time, nine million bodhisattvas [in that land] raised their voices together, saying: "We wish to go to the Sahā world to make offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha and to see Vimalakirti and the other bodhisattvas."

The Buddha said: "You may go. But retract your body-fragrance, so that the sentient beings there do not give rise to thoughts of attachment. Also, abandon your original forms, so as not to cause those in that country who seek the bodhisattva-[path] to feel self-shame. Also, do not harbor thoughts of contempt or obstruction regarding that land. Why? The lands of the ten directions are all like empty space. Also, the Buddhas, wishing to convert those who delight in the petty Dharma, merely do not completely manifest their pure lands."

## The Fragrant Meal

The Emanated Bodhisattva received the bowl of rice and, together with the nine million bodhisattvas—supported by the Buddha's majestic spirit and Vimalakirti's power—suddenly disappeared from that world and, in a moment, arrived at Vimalakirti's house.

Vimalakirti immediately manifested nine million lion-seats, majestic and fine as before, and the bodhisattvas all sat upon them. The Emanated Bodhisattva gave the bowl full of fragrant rice to Vimalakirti. The fragrance of the rice perfumed the entire city of Vaiśālī and the Triple Thousand Great Thousand Worlds.

At that time, the Brahmins and householders of Vaiśālī smelled this fragrance; their bodies and minds became blissful, and they praised it as unprecedented. The Elder Moon-Canopy (*Candracchatra*) came with 84,000 people to enter Vimalakirti's house. Seeing the many bodhisattvas in the room and the tall, wide, majestic lion-seats, they were all greatly delighted. They bowed to the bodhisattvas and great disciples and stood to one side. The Earth Gods, Sky Gods, and Devas of the Desire and Form realms, smelling this fragrance, also all came into Vimalakirti's house.

## Dharma-Food

Then Vimalakirti said to Śāriputra and the Great Śrāvakas: "Virtuous Ones, you may eat. This is the rice of the Tathāgata's ambrosia (*amṛta*), perfumed by Great Compassion. Do not eat it with a limited mind, or it will not be digested."

A certain Śrāvaka thought: "This rice is little, yet this great assembly is one where everyone must eat."

The Emanated Bodhisattva said: "Do not measure the Tathāgata's measureless merit and wisdom with the small virtue and small intelligence of a Śrāvaka! Even if the four seas were exhausted, this rice would be inexhaustible! If all people ate a lump the size of Mount Sumeru for an entire aeon, it would still not be exhausted. Why? Because it consists of surplus from the consumption of one possessing inexhaustible discipline, concentration, wisdom, liberation, and the knowledge-vision of liberation. It can never be exhausted."

Accordingly, the bowl of rice satisfied the entire assembly without being depleted. The bodhisattvas, śrāvakas, gods, and humans who ate this rice became physically comfortable and happy, just like the bodhisattvas of the Joyful Adornment world. Also, fine fragrance emanated from all their pores, just like the fragrance of the trees in the Accumulated Fragrance country.

## Teaching by Scent vs. Teaching by Words

Vimalakirti asked the Accumulated Fragrance Bodhisattvas: "How does the Tathāgata Fragrance Accumulation speak the Dharma?"

Those bodhisattvas said: "In our land, the Tathāgata does not use words or speech (*akṣara*). merely by means of the gathering of fragrances, human and devas obtain entry into the practice of discipline. The bodhisattvas sit individually beneath fragrant trees; smelling this fine fragrance, they immediately obtain the Samādhi of the Treasury of All Merit. Those who obtain this samādhi have all bodhisattva-merits completely fulfilled."⁴

Those bodhisattvas asked Vimalakirti: "How does the World Honored One Śākyamuni speak the Dharma?"

Vimalakirti said: "The sentient beings of this land are stubborn and difficult to convert. Therefore, the Buddha uses rigid and strong language to tame them. He says: 'This is hell. This is the animal realm. This is the hungry ghost realm. These are the places of difficulty. These are the places where fools are born.

"'This is bodily wrong action, this is the retribution for bodily wrong action. This is verbal wrong action... mental wrong action... This is killing... stealing... sexual misconduct... lying... double-tongued speech... harsh speech... frivolous speech... greed... anger... wrong view... stinginess... breaking precepts... laziness... distraction... stupidity.

"'This is keeping the precepts. This is breaking the precepts. This is what should be done. This is what should not be done. This is an obstruction. This is not an obstruction. This is incurring guilt. This is leaving guilt. This is pure. This is filthy. This is tainted (*sāsrava*). This is taintless. This is the wrong path. This is the right path. This is conditioned. This is unconditioned. This is the world. This is Nirvana.'

"Because the minds of people who are difficult to convert are like monkeys,⁵ he uses various kinds of Dharma to control their minds so they can be tamed. Like an elephant or horse that is stubborn and wild: one must apply sharp punishments until they pierce the bone, and only then are they tamed. Because these sentient beings are stubborn and difficult to convert, he uses all these bitter and cutting words to enable them to enter into discipline."

Those bodhisattvas, hearing this explanation, all said: "Unprecedented! The World Honored One Śākyamuni Buddha hides his measureless sovereign power and uses the method of poverty to save sentient beings. These bodhisattvas [here] are also capable of toil and humility, being born in this Buddha-land out of measureless Great Compassion."

Vimalakirti said: "The Great Compassion of the bodhisattvas of this land is firm, truly as you say. However, benefiting sentient beings for a single lifetime here is greater than practicing for a hundred thousand aeons in that [Fragrance] land. Why? This Sahā world has ten items of Good Dharma that other pure lands lack."

## The Ten Good Dharmas of the Sahā World

"What are the ten?
1.  Using giving (*dāna*) to gather the poor.
2.  Using pure precepts to gather those who break prohibitions.
3.  Using patience (*kṣānti*) to gather the angry.
4.  Using vigor (*vīrya*) to gather the lazy.
5.  Using meditation (*dhyāna*) to gather the distracted.
6.  Using wisdom (*prajñā*) to gather the foolish.
7.  Speaking the Dharma of removing difficulties to save those in the eight difficulties.
8.  Using the Mahāyāna Dharma to save those who delight in the Hīnayāna.
9.  Using various roots of goodness to relieve those without virtue.
10. Constantly using the Four Means of Attraction (*saṃgraha-vastu*) to accomplish sentient beings."

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Footnotes

1.  **Fragrance Accumulation (Gandhottamakūṭa)**: This Buddha-field represents a realm of purely aesthetic/sensory orientation. Unlike our world, where teaching is verbal/conceptual, there, teaching is olfactory and direct.
2.  **Mañjuśrī's supernatural power**: Vimalakirti implies that the silence of the bodhisattvas is due to Mañjuśrī's restraining influence, perhaps testing them or allowing the scene to unfold.
3.  **Five Turbidities (Pañca-kaṣāya)**: The characteristic marks of our degenerate age: turbidity of the aeon, of views, of afflictions, of sentient beings, and of lifespan.
4.  **Samādhi of the Treasury of All Merit**: The realization that sensory experience (smell), when purified of grasping, instantly conveys the totality of Buddhist practice.
5.  **Minds like monkeys**: *Kapicitta*. Identifying the restless, grasping nature of the human mind designated for verbal instruction.

### Definition of Dharma-Food

The concept of "Dharma-food" suggests that spiritual nourishment works physiologically as well as intellectually. In this chapter, the consumption of the "leftovers" of the Fragrance Buddha transforms the bodies of the Śrāvakas (who usually seek personal liberation) into bodies capable of generating Great Compassion. The "digestion" of this food is contingent on a "non-limited mind"—i.e., one must digest the concept of Emptiness to digest the ambrosia of the Tathāgata.
