# Chapter 5: Manjuśrī Inquires About the Illness

## 文殊師利問疾品第五

*Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel*

---

## The Buddha's Commission

At that time, the Buddha addressed Manjuśrī: "Go and visit Vimalakīrti to inquire about his illness."

Manjuśrī said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! That superior person is difficult to respond to in dialogue. He has deeply penetrated the true nature of reality (*bhūtatathatā*), is skilled in expounding the essentials of the Dharma, possesses unobstructed eloquence, and has wisdom without impediment. He knows all the methods of the bodhisattvas and has entered into all the secret treasures of the Buddhas. He has subdued the hosts of Māra, plays freely with supernatural powers, and has perfected both wisdom and skillful means. Nevertheless, I shall accept the Buddha's sacred directive and go to inquire about his illness."

## The Great Assembly Follows

At that moment, all the bodhisattvas, great disciples, Śakra, Brahmā, and the Four Heavenly Kings[^1] in the assembly thought: "Now these two great beings—Manjuśrī and Vimalakīrti—will converse together, and they will surely expound the wonderful Dharma!" At once, eight thousand bodhisattvas, five hundred śrāvakas, and hundreds of thousands of gods and humans all wished to follow.

Thus Manjuśrī, together with the bodhisattvas, the assembly of great disciples, and the gods and humans, respectfully surrounded him and entered the great city of Vaiśālī.

[^1]: The Four Heavenly Kings (*Caturmahārāja*) are the guardian deities of the four cardinal directions who protect the world from evil influences.

## Vimalakīrti Prepares His Chamber

At that time, the elder Vimalakīrti thought to himself: "Now Manjuśrī is coming with a great assembly!" Immediately, through his supernatural power, he emptied his chamber, removing all furnishings and attendants, leaving only a single bed upon which he lay ill.

---

## The Greeting of Non-Coming

When Manjuśrī entered his dwelling and saw the chamber empty, with nothing whatsoever, and Vimalakīrti reclining alone on a single bed, Vimalakīrti said: "Welcome, Manjuśrī! You come with the mark of not-coming; you see with the mark of not-seeing."[^2]

Manjuśrī replied: "Just so, householder! If one has already come, one does not come again; if one has already gone, one does not go again. Why is this? One who comes has nowhere from which they come; one who goes has nowhere to which they go. What can be seen can no longer be seen. But let us set this matter aside. Householder! Is this illness bearable? Is the treatment diminishing it rather than increasing it? The World-Honored One sends his earnest regards and inquires without measure. Householder! What is the cause of this illness? How long has it persisted? How may it be extinguished?"

[^2]: This famous exchange establishes the non-dual philosophy that permeates the sutra. "Coming" and "seeing" are conventional appearances without ultimate reality—the enlightened one moves through the world without the marks of motion or perception.

## The Illness of Great Compassion

Vimalakīrti said: "From ignorance (*avidyā*) arises craving (*tṛṣṇā*), and thus my illness arises. Because all sentient beings are ill, therefore I am ill. If the illness of all sentient beings were extinguished, then my illness would be extinguished. Why is this? The bodhisattva enters birth-and-death (*saṃsāra*) for the sake of sentient beings; having birth-and-death, there is illness. If sentient beings could be freed from illness, then the bodhisattva would have no more illness.

"It is like a wealthy man who has an only child. When that child becomes ill, the father and mother also become ill. If the child recovers, the father and mother also recover. The bodhisattva is like this—loving all sentient beings as their own children. When sentient beings are ill, the bodhisattva is ill; when sentient beings recover, the bodhisattva also recovers.

"You also asked, 'What is the cause of this illness?' The bodhisattva's illness arises from great compassion (*mahākaruṇā*)."[^3]

[^3]: This is the central soteriological principle of the chapter: the bodhisattva's illness is not personal karma but the manifestation of compassionate identification with all suffering beings. This "illness of compassion" (*karuṇā-vyādhi*) is a skillful means for teaching.

## The Emptiness of the Chamber

Manjuśrī asked: "Householder! Why is this chamber empty, without attendants?"

Vimalakīrti replied: "All buddha-lands are also empty."

"What makes them empty?"

"They are empty by emptiness."

"What is the use of empty emptiness?"

"They are empty because of non-discriminating emptiness."

"Can emptiness be discriminated?"

"Discrimination itself is also empty."

"Where should emptiness be sought?"

"It should be sought within the sixty-two views."[^4]

"Where should the sixty-two views be sought?"

"They should be sought within the liberation of all buddhas."

"Where should the liberation of all buddhas be sought?"

"It should be sought within the mental activities of all sentient beings.

"You also asked, 'Why are there no attendants?' All māras and all non-Buddhist practitioners are my attendants. Why is this? The māras delight in birth-and-death, and the bodhisattva does not abandon birth-and-death. The non-Buddhists delight in various views, and the bodhisattva is unmoved by various views."

[^4]: The sixty-two views (*dvāṣaṣṭhi-dṛṣṭi*) are the classical enumeration of wrong philosophical positions, including eternalism, nihilism, and their variations.

---

## The Nature of the Illness

Manjuśrī asked: "Householder! What is the characteristic of this illness?"

Vimalakīrti replied: "My illness has no form and cannot be seen."

"Is this illness united with the body or united with the mind?"

"It is not united with the body, because bodily characteristics are transcended. It is also not united with the mind, because the mind is like an illusion."

"Among the four great elements—earth, water, fire, and wind—which element's illness is this?"

"This illness is not of the earth element, yet it does not leave the earth element. Water, fire, and wind are likewise. Yet the illness of sentient beings arises from the four elements; because they have illness, therefore I have illness."

## How to Console an Ill Bodhisattva

At that time, Manjuśrī asked Vimalakīrti: "How should a bodhisattva console another bodhisattva who is ill?"

Vimalakīrti replied: "Speak of the impermanence of the body, but do not speak of weariness and disgust for the body. Speak of the body's suffering, but do not speak of delight in nirvāṇa. Speak of the non-self of the body, while teaching and guiding sentient beings. Speak of the body's empty tranquility, but do not speak of ultimate extinction. Speak of repenting past transgressions, but do not speak of entering the past.

"Through one's own illness, have compassion for the illness of others. Recognize the suffering of countless past lives, and think of benefiting all sentient beings. Remember the merit cultivated, contemplate a pure livelihood, and do not give rise to anxiety or distress. Always arouse vigor. Become a king of physicians, healing all diseases. This is how a bodhisattva should console an ill bodhisattva and cause them to rejoice."

---

## How to Discipline the Mind

Manjuśrī asked: "Householder! How should an ill bodhisattva discipline their mind?"

Vimalakīrti replied: "An ill bodhisattva should reflect thus: 'This present illness of mine arises entirely from the confused thoughts and afflictions of past lives. There is no real dharma—who is the one who receives illness? Why is this? The four great elements combine and are conventionally called a body; the four elements have no master, and the body also has no self.

"'Moreover, this illness arises entirely from attachment to a self. Therefore, one should not give rise to attachment to a self.' Having understood the root of illness, one should abandon the notion of self and the notion of sentient beings.

"One should give rise to the notion of dharma and reflect thus: 'This body is merely a combination of dharmas. When arising, only dharmas arise; when ceasing, only dharmas cease. Moreover, these dharmas do not know each other—when arising, they do not say "I arise"; when ceasing, they do not say "I cease."'

"That ill bodhisattva, to extinguish the notion of dharma, should further reflect: 'This notion of dharma is also a confused thought. Confused thought is the great affliction; I should abandon it.' How to abandon it? Abandon self and what belongs to self. How to abandon self and what belongs to self? Abandon the two dharmas. How to abandon the two dharmas? Do not think of internal or external, and practice equality among all dharmas.

"What is equality? It is the equality of self and nirvāṇa. Why is this? Self and nirvāṇa are both empty. Why are they empty? They are empty merely as names. These two dharmas have no fixed nature; attaining this equality, there is no other illness—there is only the illness of emptiness. And the illness of emptiness is also empty.

"This ill bodhisattva, by not receiving yet receiving all experiences, and having not yet completed the buddha-dharma, does not extinguish experience to attain realization."[^5]

[^5]: This passage articulates the Middle Way between attachment and extinction. The bodhisattva neither grasps experiences nor prematurely extinguishes them, maintaining engagement with saṃsāra for the benefit of beings.

## The True Bodhisattva Practice

"If the body experiences suffering, one should think of beings in the evil destinies and give rise to great compassion. 'I have already tamed myself; I should also tame all sentient beings.' One should only remove their illness while not removing the dharma, and teach them to cut off the root of illness.

"What is the root of illness? It is grasping (*upādāna*). From grasping comes the root of illness. What is grasped? The three realms. How to cut off grasping? Through non-attainment. If there is nothing to attain, then there is no grasping. What is meant by non-attainment? Abandoning the two views. What are the two views? Internal views and external views. This is non-attainment.

"Manjuśrī! This is how an ill bodhisattva disciplines their mind—to cut off the suffering of old age, illness, and death. This is the bodhisattva's awakening. If it is not like this, one's cultivation has no benefit of wisdom. Just as defeating enemies can be called courage, likewise one who can also remove old age, illness, and death—this is what is meant by 'bodhisattva.'"

## Beyond Love-View Compassion

"That ill bodhisattva should further reflect: 'Just as my illness is neither true nor existent, the illness of sentient beings is also neither true nor existent.' When making this observation, if toward sentient beings there arises love-view great compassion (*sneha-dṛṣṭi-mahākaruṇā*), one should immediately abandon it. Why is this?

"The bodhisattva eradicates the afflictions that are adventitious defilements and then gives rise to great compassion. Love-view compassion leads to weariness in the cycle of birth-and-death. If one can leave this behind, there is no weariness. Wherever one is reborn, one is not covered by love-views. Being unbound in rebirth, one can expound the Dharma for sentient beings to liberate their bonds.

"As the Buddha has said: 'If one is bound oneself and can liberate others' bonds—there is no such thing. If one is not bound oneself and can liberate others' bonds—this is possible.'

"Therefore the bodhisattva should not give rise to bondage. What is bondage? What is liberation? Attachment to the taste of meditation (*dhyāna-rasa*) is the bodhisattva's bondage; arising through skillful means is the bodhisattva's liberation.

"Again: wisdom without skillful means is bondage; wisdom with skillful means is liberation. Skillful means without wisdom is bondage; skillful means with wisdom is liberation.

"What is wisdom without skillful means as bondage? It is when a bodhisattva adorns buddha-lands and accomplishes sentient beings with a mind of love-views, and disciplines themselves in the dharmas of emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness—this is called wisdom without skillful means as bondage.

"What is wisdom with skillful means as liberation? It is when one adorns buddha-lands and accomplishes sentient beings without a mind of love-views, and disciplines oneself in the dharmas of emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness without weariness—this is called wisdom with skillful means as liberation.

"What is skillful means without wisdom as bondage? It is when a bodhisattva dwells in desire, anger, wrong views, and other afflictions while planting roots of virtue—this is called skillful means without wisdom as bondage.

"What is skillful means with wisdom as liberation? It is when one departs from desire, anger, wrong views, and other afflictions while planting roots of virtue and dedicating them to *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*—this is called skillful means with wisdom as liberation.

"Manjuśrī! That ill bodhisattva should observe all dharmas thus. Moreover, one should observe the body as impermanent, suffering, empty, and non-self—this is called wisdom. Although the body is ill, constantly remaining in birth-and-death to benefit all while not becoming weary—this is called skillful means.

"Moreover, observing the body: the body does not leave illness, and illness does not leave the body; this illness is this body, neither new nor old—this is called wisdom. Though the body is ill, not permanently extinguishing it—this is called skillful means."

---

## The Non-Abiding Bodhisattva Practice

"Manjuśrī! An ill bodhisattva should discipline their mind in this way: neither abiding in it, nor abiding in an undisciplined mind. Why is this? If one abides in an undisciplined mind, this is the dharma of the ignorant. If one abides in a disciplined mind, this is the dharma of the śrāvaka. Therefore the bodhisattva should not abide in either discipline or non-discipline. Leaving these two dharmas is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Being in birth-and-death without being defiled by its practices; abiding in nirvāṇa without being permanently extinguished—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Neither the practice of ordinary beings nor the practice of sages—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Neither defiled practice nor pure practice—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Though surpassing māra's practice, yet manifesting the subduing of māras—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Seeking all-knowledge without seeking it at the wrong time—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though observing that dharmas are unborn, yet not entering the fixed position of cessation—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Though observing the twelve links of dependent origination, yet entering into all wrong views—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though gathering in all sentient beings, yet without attachment—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though delighting in seclusion, yet not relying on the exhaustion of body and mind—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Though practicing in the three realms, yet not damaging the nature of dharmas—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though practicing emptiness, yet planting roots of virtue—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though practicing signlessness, yet liberating sentient beings—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though practicing wishlessness, yet manifesting receiving a body—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Though practicing non-arising, yet arising in all good practices—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though practicing the six perfections, yet fully knowing the mental states of sentient beings—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though practicing the six supernatural powers, yet not exhausting the outflows—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Though practicing the four immeasurables, yet not craving to be born in the Brahma world—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though practicing meditation, liberation, and samādhi, yet not being reborn according to meditation—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Though practicing the four foundations of mindfulness, yet not permanently leaving body, sensation, mind, and dharmas—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though practicing the four right efforts, yet not abandoning the vigor of body and mind—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though practicing the four bases of supernatural power, yet attaining mastery of supernatural powers—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Though practicing the five faculties, yet discerning the sharp and dull faculties of sentient beings—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though practicing the five powers, yet delighting in seeking the ten powers of a Buddha—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though practicing the seven factors of awakening, yet discerning the wisdom of a Buddha—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Though practicing the Noble Eightfold Path, yet delighting in practicing the immeasurable Buddha-path—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though practicing calming and insight as aids to the path, yet not ultimately falling into extinction—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Though practicing the non-arising and non-ceasing of dharmas, yet adorning the body with the marks and signs—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though manifesting the deportment of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, yet not abandoning the Buddha-dharma—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Though following the ultimately pure characteristics of dharmas, yet manifesting a body according to what is appropriate—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though observing that the lands of all buddhas are eternally still like space, yet manifesting various pure buddha-lands—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Though attaining the Buddha-path, turning the Dharma wheel, and entering nirvāṇa, yet not abandoning the bodhisattva path—this is the bodhisattva's practice."

## The Assembly's Awakening

When these words were spoken, eight thousand gods in the great assembly brought by Manjuśrī all aroused the aspiration for *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*.

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Key Philosophical Concepts

1. **Non-Dual Coming/Seeing**: The opening exchange establishes the epistemological framework—conventional appearances of motion and perception are empty of inherent existence (*svabhāva-śūnya*).

2. **Compassionate Illness**: The bodhisattva's illness is not karmic retribution but the natural expression of identification with suffering beings—a soteriological device rather than a personal condition.

3. **Emptiness Dialogues**: The rapid-fire exchange about emptiness demonstrates the Mādhyamika method of deconstructing all fixed categories, including the category of emptiness itself.

4. **Wisdom and Skillful Means**: The dialectic between *prajñā* (wisdom) and *upāya* (skillful means) establishes that neither alone is sufficient—only their union constitutes true liberation.

5. **Neither-Nor Practice**: The extended list of "though...yet..." formulations articulates the distinctive bodhisattva path that transcends both worldly attachment and premature cessation.

### Cross-References

- For the concept of compassionate identification with suffering, see Chapter 2 (Skillful Means) on Vimalakīrti's illness as teaching device
