# Chapter 3: The Disciples Blues

**Blues Translation by Master John Kim**

---

## Vimalakirti Waiting

At that time, the elder Vimalakirti thought to himself: "Here I am, sick in bed. The World-Honored One got such great compassion—ain't he gonna take pity on me?"

The Buddha knew what he was thinking and immediately told Śāriputra: "Go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

---

## Śāriputra Ain't Going

Śāriputra said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time back in the day, I was sitting in meditation¹ under a tree in the forest. Vimalakirti came up and said to me:

"'Hey, Śāriputra! Just 'cause you're sitting don't mean you're meditating. True meditation² means not manifesting body or mind in the three realms—that's meditation. Not arising from the cessation³ yet showing all the deportments—that's meditation. Not abandoning the Way yet doing ordinary things—that's meditation. The mind not dwelling inside and not being outside—that's meditation. Not being moved by any views yet practicing the thirty-seven factors⁴—that's meditation. Not cutting off afflictions yet entering nirvāṇa—that's meditation. One who can sit like that—the Buddha approves.'

"At that time—World-Honored One!—when I heard these words, I just went silent. Couldn't say nothing back. That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

---

## Maudgalyāyana Ain't Going

The Buddha told Mahāmaudgalyāyana:⁵ "You go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

Maudgalyāyana said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time in the past, I went into the great city of Vaiśālī and was teaching the Dharma to the householders in the lanes. Vimalakirti came up and said to me:

"'Hey, Great Maudgalyāyana! When you're teaching the Dharma to these white-robed householders, you shouldn't teach like you've been teaching. One who teaches the Dharma should teach according to the Dharma.⁶

"'The Dharma is without sentient beings—it's free from the defilement of sentient beings. The Dharma is without self—it's free from the defilement of self. The Dharma is without life-span—it's free from birth and death. The Dharma is without persons—past and future are cut off.⁷ The Dharma is constantly quiet—all characteristics extinguished. The Dharma is apart from characteristics—nothing to grab onto. The Dharma is without name or word—talk is cut off.⁸ The Dharma is without explanation—free from thought and examination. The Dharma is without form—like empty space. The Dharma is without mental proliferation⁹—ultimately empty. The Dharma is without "mine"—free from "mine." The Dharma is without discrimination—free from all consciousnesses. The Dharma is without comparison—nothing to compare it to. The Dharma don't belong to causes—ain't located in conditions. The Dharma is identical with dharma-nature—enters all dharmas. The Dharma accords with thusness—ain't nothing it accords with. The Dharma abides at the true limit¹⁰—the extremes don't move it. The Dharma is without movement—don't depend on the six sense-objects. The Dharma is without coming or going—constantly don't abide. The Dharma conforms to emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness.¹¹ The Dharma is apart from beauty and ugliness. The Dharma is without increase or decrease. The Dharma is without birth or death. The Dharma got no destination. The Dharma transcends eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. The Dharma is without high or low. The Dharma constantly abides without moving. The Dharma is apart from all conditioned practice.

"'Hey, Great Maudgalyāyana! The Dharma being like this, how can it be spoken? One who teaches the Dharma neither speaks nor demonstrates; one who listens neither hears nor attains. It's like a conjurer¹² teaching conjured beings—establish that understanding when you teach.

"'You should understand that folks' faculties are sharp or dull. Be skillful in knowing and seeing without obstruction. With the mind of great compassion, praise the Great Vehicle. Remember to repay the Buddha's kindness and don't let the Three Jewels be cut off—only then teach the Dharma.'

"When Vimalakirti taught this, eight hundred householders generated the mind of supreme enlightenment. I ain't got that eloquence. That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

---

## Mahākāśyapa Ain't Going

The Buddha told Mahākāśyapa:¹³ "You go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

Mahākāśyapa said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time in the past, I was begging for alms in the poor quarter. Vimalakirti came up and said to me:

"'Hey, Mahākāśyapa! You got a mind of loving-kindness and compassion, but you ain't universal with it—you bypass the rich and beg from the poor.¹⁴ Kāśyapa! Abide in the Dharma of equality and beg in proper sequence. Because you don't need to eat, you should beg for food. To destroy the appearance of composite unity,¹⁵ you should receive morsels. Because you don't receive, you should accept their food.

"'Enter the village with the perception of emptiness.¹⁶ See the forms you see like a blind man sees. Hear the sounds you hear like an echo. Smell the fragrances you smell like the wind. Taste the tastes you eat without discrimination. Accept all tangible things like cognitive wisdom. Know all dharmas as illusory in nature—without self-nature, without other-nature, originally not being so, and even now without extinction.¹⁷

"'Kāśyapa! If you can avoid rejecting the eight deviations¹⁸ and enter the eight liberations,¹⁹ using deviant characteristics to enter true Dharma; if with a single meal you can make offerings to all, making offerings to all buddhas and the assemblies of noble sages, and only then eat—eating like that, you're neither with afflictions nor apart from afflictions, neither entering concentration nor arising from concentration, neither dwelling in the worldly nor dwelling in nirvāṇa. Those who give to you will have neither great merit nor small merit—it neither benefits them nor harms them. This is correctly entering the Buddha-Way, not relying on the way of the śrāvakas.²⁰ Kāśyapa! If you eat like that, you don't vainly consume people's offerings.'

"At that time—World-Honored One!—when I heard these words, I experienced what I never experienced before. I immediately arose profound respect for all bodhisattvas. I thought: 'This one bearing a householder's name²¹ got such eloquence and wisdom! Who, hearing this, wouldn't generate the mind of supreme enlightenment?' From then on, I never again encouraged people to follow the ways of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas.²² That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

---

## Subhūti Ain't Going

The Buddha told Subhūti:²³ "You go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

Subhūti said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time in the past, I went into his house to beg for food. Vimalakirti took my bowl, filled it with rice, and said to me:

"'Hey, Subhūti! If you can be equal regarding food, then all dharmas are also equal. If all dharmas are equal, then you're also equal regarding food.²⁴ Begging like that, you can take the food.

"'Subhūti! If you don't cut off lust, anger, and delusion, yet ain't bound by them; if you don't destroy the body yet accord with the single characteristic;²⁵ if you don't extinguish delusion and craving yet arise insight and liberation;²⁶ if with the characteristics of the five grave offenses you attain liberation,²⁷ yet are neither liberated nor bound; if you don't see the Four Noble Truths, yet it ain't that you haven't seen them; if you don't attain the fruits, yet it ain't that you haven't attained the fruits; if you're neither an ordinary person nor apart from ordinary-person dharmas; if you're neither a sage nor not a sage; if, though you accomplish all dharmas, you're apart from the characteristics of all dharmas—then you can take the food.

"'If, Subhūti, you don't see the Buddha and don't hear the Dharma—if those six heterodox teachers,²⁸ Pūraṇa Kāśyapa, Maskarin Gośālīputra, Sañjayin Vairaṭīputra, Ajita Keśakambala, Kakuda Kātyāyana, and Nirgrantha Jñātṛputra—if these are your teachers, and you left home following them, and wherever those teachers fall, you also fall—then you can take the food.

"'If, Subhūti, you enter wrong views and don't reach the other shore; if you dwell in the eight difficulties²⁹ and don't get freedom from difficulty; if you're identified with afflictions and separated from pure dharmas; if you get the samādhi of non-contention,³⁰ yet all sentient beings also get this samādhi; if those who give to you ain't called a field of merit; if those who make offerings to you fall into the three evil paths; if you join hands with Māra and make all distressed ones your companions; if you're no different from all māras and all afflictions; if you got enmity toward all sentient beings, slander all buddhas, and destroy the Dharma; if you ain't numbered among the assembly and will never attain final nirvāṇa—if you're like that, then you can take the food.'

"At that time—World-Honored One!—when I heard these words, I was bewildered.³¹ I didn't know what he was saying or how to answer. I set down my bowl and wanted to leave his house. Vimalakirti said:

"'Hey, Subhūti! Take your bowl—don't be afraid. What do you think? If a transformation-being³² created by the Tathāgata was questioned about this, would he be afraid?'

"I said: 'No.'

"Vimalakirti said: 'All dharmas are like illusory transformations. You shouldn't have any fear now. Why? All verbal expressions don't depart from this characteristic.³³ As for the wise, they ain't attached to words and therefore got no fear. Why? The nature of words is empty—there are no words. This is liberation. The characteristic of liberation is the characteristic of all dharmas.'

"When Vimalakirti taught this Dharma, two hundred devas got the pure Dharma-eye. That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

---

## Pūrṇa Ain't Going

The Buddha told Pūrṇa:³⁴ "You go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

Pūrṇa said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time in the past, I was in the great forest³⁵ under a tree, teaching the Dharma to some newly-ordained monks. Vimalakirti came up and said to me:

"'Hey, Pūrṇa! First you should enter samādhi and observe these people's minds, then teach. Don't put defiled food in a precious vessel.³⁶ You should know what these monks are thinking. Don't confuse lapis lazuli with crystal.³⁷ You can't know the roots of sentient beings—don't presume to give the Lesser Vehicle Dharma.³⁸ They themselves got no wounds—don't wound them. Those wanting to walk the great path shouldn't be shown the small path. Don't put the great ocean into an ox's hoofprint. Don't treat sunlight the same as firefly light.

"'Pūrṇa! These monks long ago generated the Great Vehicle mind but forgot it in the middle. Why do you instruct them with the Lesser Vehicle Dharma? I see that Lesser Vehicle wisdom is shallow and petty, like a blind person who can't distinguish the sharp and dull faculties of sentient beings.'

"At that time, Vimalakirti immediately entered samādhi and caused those monks to know their former lives:³⁹ they'd planted roots of merit under five hundred buddhas and had dedicated them toward supreme enlightenment. Immediately their realization was clear, and they regained their original minds. All the monks bowed at Vimalakirti's feet. Then Vimalakirti taught them the Dharma, and they became irreversible from supreme enlightenment.

"I thought that śrāvakas who don't observe people's faculties shouldn't teach the Dharma. That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

---

## Mahākātyāyana Ain't Going

The Buddha told Mahākātyāyana:⁴⁰ "You go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

Kātyāyana said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time in the past, after the Buddha briefly taught the essential teachings to the monks, I afterward elaborated on their meaning—the meaning of impermanence, the meaning of suffering, the meaning of emptiness, the meaning of non-self, the meaning of quiescence.⁴¹ Vimalakirti came up and said to me:

"'Hey, Kātyāyana! Don't use the mind of arising and ceasing⁴² to explain the Dharma of true reality.⁴³ Kātyāyana! All dharmas ultimately neither arise nor cease—that's the meaning of impermanence.⁴⁴ The five appropriated aggregates,⁴⁵ penetrated through, are empty and without arising—that's the meaning of suffering.⁴⁶ All dharmas ultimately got nothing whatsoever—that's the meaning of emptiness.⁴⁷ Self and no-self ain't two—that's the meaning of non-self.⁴⁸ The Dharma originally wasn't so, and even now is without extinction—that's the meaning of quiescence.'⁴⁹

"When he taught this Dharma, all those monks liberated their minds. That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

---

## Aniruddha Ain't Going

The Buddha told Aniruddha:⁵⁰ "You go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

Aniruddha said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time in the past, I was doing walking meditation somewhere. A Brahmā-king named Śubhavyūha,⁵¹ together with ten thousand Brahmās, emitting pure radiance, came to me, bowed at my feet, and asked:

"'How far does the divine eye of Aniruddha see?'

"I replied: 'Benevolent one! I see the entire billion-world system of Śākyamuni Buddha, like viewing a small fruit⁵² in the palm of my hand.'

"At that time, Vimalakirti came up and said to me: 'Hey, Aniruddha! Does what the divine eye sees have the characteristic of conditioned activity or the characteristic of unconditioned activity?⁵³ If it's conditioned, then it's the same as the five supernatural powers of the heterodox teachers. If it's unconditioned, then it's the unconditioned and shouldn't have seeing.'

"World-Honored One! At that time I just went silent. The Brahmās, hearing his words, experienced what they never experienced before, and immediately bowed to him and asked: 'Who in the world truly possesses the divine eye?'

"Vimalakirti said: 'There is—the Buddha, the World-Honored One, possesses the true divine eye.⁵⁴ Constantly abiding in samādhi, he sees all buddha-lands without the characteristic of duality.'

"Then the Brahmā-king Śubhavyūha and his entourage of five hundred Brahmā-devas all generated the mind of supreme enlightenment. Having bowed at Vimalakirti's feet, they suddenly disappeared. That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

---

## Upāli Ain't Going

The Buddha told Upāli:⁵⁵ "You go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

Upāli said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time in the past, two monks had violated the Vinaya rules⁵⁶ and were ashamed to ask the Buddha. They came to ask me:

"'Upāli! We violated the Vinaya and are truly ashamed. We dare not ask the Buddha. Please resolve our doubt and regret so we can be freed from this fault.'

"I immediately explained according to the Dharma. Vimalakirti came up and said to me:

"'Hey, Upāli! Don't add to the guilt of these two monks! Just directly eliminate it; don't disturb their minds. Why? The nature of that guilt ain't internal, ain't external, and ain't in between.⁵⁷ As the Buddha said, when the mind is defiled, sentient beings are defiled; when the mind is pure, sentient beings are pure. The mind, too, ain't internal, ain't external, and ain't in between. As the mind is, so is guilt-defilement; so are all dharmas—not departing from thusness.⁵⁸

"'Upāli! When the mind-characteristic attains liberation, is there defilement or not?'

"I said: 'There is not.'

"Vimalakirti said: 'The mind-characteristic of all sentient beings being without defilement is also like this. Hey, Upāli! Delusive thinking is defilement; no delusive thinking is purity. Inversion is defilement; no inversion is purity. Grasping a self is defilement; not grasping a self is purity.

"'Upāli! All dharmas arise and cease without abiding, like illusion, like lightning.⁵⁹ Dharmas don't wait for each other—they don't even abide for a single moment. All dharmas are false appearances, like a dream, like a flame, like the moon in water, like a reflection in a mirror—they arise from delusive thinking. One who knows this is one who upholds the Vinaya. One who knows this has good understanding.'

"Then the two monks said: 'Supreme wisdom! This is something Upāli can't match—the foremost upholder of the Vinaya, yet he can't speak like this!'⁶⁰

"I replied: 'Setting aside the Tathāgata, no śrāvaka or bodhisattva can match his joyful eloquence—his wisdom and insight are so brilliant!'

"At that time, the two monks' doubt and regret were immediately removed. They generated the mind of supreme enlightenment and made this vow: 'May all sentient beings attain this eloquence!'

"That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

---

## Rāhula Ain't Going

The Buddha told Rāhula:⁶¹ "You go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

Rāhula said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time in the past, the elder's sons of Vaiśālī came to me, bowed at my feet, and asked:

"'Rāhula! You're the son of the Buddha. You renounced the position of a wheel-turning king and left home to pursue the Way. What benefits does leaving home have?'

"I immediately explained the benefits and merits of leaving home according to the Dharma. Vimalakirti came up and said to me:

"'Hey, Rāhula! You shouldn't speak of the benefits and merits of leaving home.⁶² Why? That which is without benefit and without merit—that is leaving home. The conditioned dharmas can be spoken of as having benefit and merit. But leaving home is the unconditioned dharma, and in the unconditioned there is no benefit and no merit.

"'Rāhula! Leaving home is being without this and without that, and without the middle between them.⁶³ It's apart from the sixty-two views,⁶⁴ abiding in nirvāṇa. It's what the wise accept and what the noble practice. It's conquering the hosts of māras, crossing beyond the five destinies, purifying the five eyes, attaining the five powers, and establishing the five faculties. It don't disturb others and departs from various evils. It's crushing the heterodox teachers and transcending conventional names. It's emerging from the mire without attachment, without "mine," without reception, without disturbance, cherishing inner joy, guarding others' minds, according with meditation, and departing from all faults. If one is able to be like that—that's true leaving home.'

"Then Vimalakirti said to the elder's sons: 'It's appropriate that you all leave home in the true Dharma together. Why? It's hard to meet a buddha-age!'

"The elder's sons said: 'Elder! We heard the Buddha say, if one's parents don't give permission, one can't leave home.'

"Vimalakirti said: 'That's right! Then you all should generate the mind of supreme enlightenment—that's leaving home, that's complete ordination.'⁶⁵

"At that time, thirty-two elder's sons all generated the mind of supreme enlightenment. That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

---

## Ānanda Ain't Going

The Buddha told Ānanda:⁶⁶ "You go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

Ānanda said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time in the past, when the World-Honored One's body had a slight illness and needed cow's milk, I immediately took my bowl and went to stand at the gate of a great brahmin's house. Vimalakirti came up and said to me:

"'Hey, Ānanda! Why you standing here with your bowl in the early morning?'

"I said: 'Elder! The World-Honored One's body has a slight illness and needs cow's milk, so I came here.'

"Vimalakirti said: 'Stop, stop, Ānanda! Don't say such things! The Tathāgata's body is a vajra body;⁶⁷ all evils been cut off; all goodness gathered together. What illness could there be? What affliction could there be?

"'Go silently, Ānanda! Don't slander the Tathāgata. Don't let others hear such coarse words. Don't let the great, powerfully-virtuous devas and the bodhisattvas who came from other pure lands hear these words.

"'Ānanda! A wheel-turning sage-king, because of just a little merit, is free from illness.⁶⁸ How much more so the Tathāgata, whose immeasurable accumulated merit is universally victorious! Go, Ānanda! Don't make us receive such disgrace. If the heterodox teachers and brahmins were to hear these words, they would think: "How can he be called a teacher? He can't save his own illness—how can he save the illnesses of others?" You should leave quick and secretly—don't let others hear.

"'You should know, Ānanda, the bodies of all tathāgatas are the Dharma-body, not the body of thought and desire.⁶⁹ The Buddha is the World-Honored One, transcending the three realms. The Buddha's body is without outflows—all outflows exhausted. The Buddha's body is unconditioned—it don't fall within enumeration.⁷⁰ Such a body—what illness could it have? What affliction could it have?'

"At that time—World-Honored One!—I was truly ashamed. Had I perhaps, being close to the Buddha, made an error in hearing?⁷¹ Immediately I heard a voice from the sky saying: 'Ānanda! What the elder says is true. But it's because the Buddha has appeared in the five turbidities of the evil age⁷² that he performs this practice to liberate sentient beings. Go, Ānanda! Take the milk and don't be ashamed.'

"World-Honored One! Such is Vimalakirti's wisdom and eloquence! That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

---

## Concluding the Blues

So all five hundred great disciples, each one explained to the Buddha the account of their own past encounter, describing what Vimalakirti had said. Every one of them declared they couldn't go ask about his illness.

---

## Endnotes

¹ **Sitting in meditation**: Śāriputra was doing formal seated meditation—the foundational practice. But Vimalakirti challenges the external form.

² **True meditation**: Vimalakirti redefines meditation. It ain't about the posture—it's about the state. His six definitions systematically deconstruct all dualities.

³ **Cessation**: The highest meditative absorption. But Vimalakirti's point: true meditation maintains liberation *while* engaging in life, not by withdrawing.

⁴ **Thirty-seven factors**: The complete Buddhist path. You can practice all of them while being unmoved by views—practice without attachment.

⁵ **Mahāmaudgalyāyana**: Foremost in supernatural powers. Gets schooled on what Dharma really is.

⁶ **Dharma according to Dharma**: This begins one of the sutra's most profound philosophical passages—twenty-plus characteristics describing what Dharma is by saying what it ain't.

⁷ **Past and future cut off**: Time dissolves under analysis. There's no continuous "person" linking past to future.

⁸ **Talk is cut off**: The Dharma transcends words. This anticipates Chapter 9's silence.

⁹ **Mental proliferation**: The thinking that obscures reality. Dharma is free from all that.

¹⁰ **True limit**: The absolute reality where all distinctions end.

¹¹ **Emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness**: The three gates to liberation.

¹² **Conjurer teaching conjured beings**: THIS IS POWERFUL. If teacher and audience are both illusions, what is teaching? Teaching still happens, but without the solidity we think it has.

¹³ **Mahākāśyapa**: Foremost in ascetic practices. The extreme austere monk.

¹⁴ **Bypassing the rich**: Kāśyapa avoided wealthy homes. Vimalakirti calls this out—true compassion is universal, not selective.

¹⁵ **Composite unity**: The false appearance of unified selfhood. Eating mindfully deconstructs even the alms-round.

¹⁶ **Perception of emptiness**: Enter the village seeing it as empty of inherent existence.

¹⁷ **Originally not being so**: A key formula—phenomena never had inherent existence. Nothing to destroy.

¹⁸ **Eight deviations**: Wrong view, thought, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, concentration.

¹⁹ **Eight liberations**: Progressive meditative attainments.

²⁰ **Not relying on the śrāvaka way**: Kāśyapa's previous approach was śrāvaka-style—seeking personal liberation through asceticism. The bodhisattva way transforms every action into benefit for all.

²¹ **Bearing a householder's name**: Emphasis that Vimalakirti is "just a layman" with such profound realization.

²² **Pratyekabuddhas**: Solitary Buddhas who wake up alone and don't teach. Limited realization from the Mahāyāna view.

²³ **Subhūti**: Foremost in understanding emptiness. His encounter with Vimalakirti is especially rich—both are emptiness specialists.

²⁴ **Equality regarding food and dharmas**: For one who realizes emptiness, there's no distinction—all equally empty, equally real.

²⁵ **Single characteristic**: The characteristic of no characteristic.

²⁶ **Insight and liberation**: Not through cutting off delusion, but through seeing through it.

²⁷ **Five grave offenses**: Killing father, mother, or arhat; shedding buddha's blood; creating schism. Even through these characteristics one can be liberated—ultimate non-attachment transcends even karma.

²⁸ **Six heterodox teachers**: The six non-Buddhist teachers of Buddha's time. Vimalakirti's point: if you're truly empty, what difference is there?

²⁹ **Eight difficulties**: Conditions making Dharma-encounter hard.

³⁰ **Samādhi of non-contention**: Subhūti's specialty—perfect peace without conflict.

³¹ **Bewildered**: Subhūti, the emptiness-master, is stunned by the paradoxes.

³² **Transformation-being**: An illusory person created by buddha's power. If questioned, it wouldn't fear because it knows it got no substantial existence.

³³ **Don't depart from this characteristic**: Language is empty too. Words are as illusory as conjured beings. Liberation is the nature of words themselves.

³⁴ **Pūrṇa**: Foremost in preaching the Dharma.

³⁵ **Great forest**: The Mahāvana near Vaiśālī.

³⁶ **Defiled food in precious vessel**: Inappropriate to put lesser teachings in minds capable of greater realization.

³⁷ **Lapis lazuli and crystal**: Don't treat the precious as ordinary.

³⁸ **Lesser Vehicle Dharma**: Teachings focused on personal liberation rather than bodhisattva-hood.

³⁹ **Knowing former lives**: Through samādhi, Vimalakirti revealed the monks' past-life aspirations.

⁴⁰ **Mahākātyāyana**: Foremost in detailed analytical exposition.

⁴¹ **Five meanings**: Standard Abhidharma expositions. Vimalakirti reinterprets each.

⁴² **Mind of arising and ceasing**: Conventional thinking that sees things as truly arising and ceasing.

⁴³ **Dharma of true reality**: Reality as it is, beyond arising and ceasing.

⁴⁴ **Meaning of impermanence reinterpreted**: Impermanence don't mean things arise and pass; rather, nothing ever truly arises or ceases.

⁴⁵ **Five appropriated aggregates**: Form, feeling, perception, formations, consciousness as grasped.

⁴⁶ **Meaning of suffering reinterpreted**: Suffering is the emptiness of the aggregates themselves.

⁴⁷ **Meaning of emptiness reinterpreted**: Not analytical absence of self, but ultimate non-existence of all dharmas.

⁴⁸ **Meaning of non-self reinterpreted**: Not merely absence of self, but non-duality of self and non-self.

⁴⁹ **Meaning of quiescence reinterpreted**: Not cessation of something that existed, but recognition nothing ever needed to be extinguished.

⁵⁰ **Aniruddha**: Foremost in the divine eye.

⁵¹ **Śubhavyūha**: "Splendid Array." A Brahmā-king.

⁵² **Small fruit**: The āmalaka fruit, used as example of something seen clearly.

⁵³ **Conditioned or unconditioned**: Vimalakirti's incisive question—if conditioned, it's mundane; if unconditioned, no seeing. Exposes the logical limits.

⁵⁴ **True divine eye**: The Buddha's seeing is beyond conditioned/unconditioned duality.

⁵⁵ **Upāli**: Foremost in Vinaya (discipline). His specialty is rules; Vimalakirti transcends rules.

⁵⁶ **Vinaya rules**: The monastic code. The two monks' violation unspecified.

⁵⁷ **Not internal, external, or in between**: Standard negation of location. Guilt, like all dharmas, is unfindable.

⁵⁸ **Not departing from thusness**: All phenomena—including guilt—are expressions of thusness. Nothing falls outside reality.

⁵⁹ **Like illusion, like lightning**: Standard images for impermanence and insubstantiality.

⁶⁰ **The Vinaya master can't match this**: The irony—the discipline specialist lacks the wisdom to truly resolve guilt. True Vinaya is understanding guilt's empty nature.

⁶¹ **Rāhula**: The Buddha's son; foremost in inconspicuous practice.

⁶² **Benefits of leaving home**: Rāhula's conventional answer focused on merit. Vimalakirti points to leaving home as unconditioned—beyond benefit.

⁶³ **Without this, that, or middle**: Complete non-duality.

⁶⁴ **Sixty-two views**: Wrong views catalogued in early Buddhism.

⁶⁵ **REVOLUTIONARY TEACHING**: Generating bodhicitta IS leaving home. You don't need to physically leave family if you generate the awakening mind. Internal transformation, accessible to laypeople.

⁶⁶ **Ānanda**: The Buddha's attendant; foremost in hearing and memory.

⁶⁷ **Vajra body**: The indestructible body of the Buddha.

⁶⁸ **Wheel-turning king free from illness**: Even mundane merit protects from disease.

⁶⁹ **KEY DOCTRINE: Dharma-body, not body of thought and desire**: The Buddha's true body is unconditioned. Foundational for Mahāyāna Buddhology.

⁷⁰ **Don't fall within enumeration**: The Buddha's body is beyond categorization.

⁷¹ **Error in hearing**: Ānanda, famous for hearing perfectly, doubts himself.

⁷² **Five turbidities**: The five degenerations of the evil age.

## Theological Notes

### The Dharma Combat Pattern

Every encounter follows the same pattern: (1) The Buddha sends a disciple; (2) the disciple recalls a past encounter with Vimalakirti; (3) Vimalakirti exposed a limitation in the disciple's understanding; (4) the disciple was silenced or transformed; (5) the disciple declines. This pattern builds dramatic tension—who CAN visit Vimalakirti?

### Each Disciple Represents a Specialty

Śāriputra (wisdom), Maudgalyāyana (powers), Kāśyapa (asceticism), Subhūti (emptiness), Pūrṇa (preaching), Kātyāyana (analysis), Aniruddha (divine eye), Upāli (discipline), Rāhula (hidden practice), Ānanda (memory). Each is foremost in something. Yet each falls short when facing Vimalakirti's non-dual understanding. The message: specialized spiritual attainments, however advanced, are still limited.

### The Superior Layman

This chapter establishes that a layperson (Vimalakirti) surpasses all the Buddha's foremost monastic disciples. This is revolutionary—challenging the assumption that awakening requires renunciation.

### Non-Dual Understanding

Each teaching Vimalakirti offers transcends dualities: sitting/not-sitting, pure/impure, wealthy/poor, views/practice, guilt/innocence, leaving home/staying home, healthy/ill. The Blues understands this—life ain't black and white, and the deepest truth transcends all oppositions.

**End of Chapter 3 - Blues Translation**
