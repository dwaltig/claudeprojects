**Title: "The Big Party in the Mango Grove"**

(The Intro)
I heard it from a friend who was there on the day,
The Big Boss was in Vaishali, down Amrapali way.
He was sittin' in the garden, under the mango tree,
With eight thousand brothers and a whole company.

(The Bodhisattvas)
Thirty-two thousand High-Rollers of the Soul,
(Keepin' their eyes on the glorious goal)
They were "Uninvited Friends," the best kind you find,
The ones who show up to help before you even mind.
They didn't wait for a phone call, didn't wait for a plea,
They just brought the Peace, baby, for you and for me.

(The Miracle of the Umbrella)
Young Ratnakara came strollin' into town,
With five hundred rich boys, all gatherin' 'round.
They brought five hundred umbrellas, shiny and grand,
To offer to the Man with the world in his hand.
But the Boss did a trick that nobody could plan,
He turned all those umbrellas into one giant span!
It covered the whole world, from the mountains to the sea,
A cosmic canopy for the whole family.

(The Song of Praise)
Ratnakara stood up and he started to sing,
(His voice ringin' out like a bell on a string)
"Your eyes are like lotuses, blue as the night,
You lead us through the darkness to the glorious light.
You don't say 'It Is' and you don't say 'It Ain't,'
You just show us the wall and you show us the paint.
You’re the Big Doctor, baby, with the universal cure,
Your heart is so peaceful, and your soul is so pure."

(The Chorus)
Oh, the Land is Clean when the Heart is Pure,
(That’s the only medicine, that’s the only cure)
If you wanna see the Kingdom, if you wanna see the Light,
You gotta stop the fightin' in the middle of the night.

**Title: "You Can't Build a House in the Air"**

(Verse 1)
The Boss looked at Ratnakara and said, "Listen close, my friend,
You’re lookin' for a Kingdom where the troubles all end.
But a Pure Land ain't made of gold or pearls so fine,
It’s made of the people walkin' on the line."

(Verse 2)
You can't build a mansion in the empty, hollow air,
(Tryin' to hang a chandelier on a ghostly prayer)
You need the solid ground, the dirt and the stone,
You need the heavy hearts that are feelin' all alone.
The "Land" is just the neighbors that you’re tryin' to help along,
The "Kingdom" is the chorus of a universal song.

(Verse 3)
He said, "Honesty is the foundation, the 'Straightforward Mind,'
No use for the hypocrites or the double-blind.
If you’re real with yourself, and you’re real with the street,
Beings with a honest soul are the ones you’re gonna meet."

(Verse 4)
"A Deep Heart is the garden where the merit starts to grow,
(Waterin' the seeds that the ancient prophets sow)
The Wish for Enlightenment is the light in the hall,
Waitin' there to shine on the great and the small."

(Chorus)
If you want a Pure Land, go and clean your mind,
(Leave the bitterness and the jealousy behind)
When your heart is shinin' like a polished chrome,
Everywhere you walk is gonna feel like Home.
Yes, the Land is Clean when the Heart is Pure,
That’s the only medicine, that’s the only cure.
