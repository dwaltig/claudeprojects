## Vimalakirti's Expectation

At that time, the elder Vimalakirti thought to himself: "I am ill and lying in bed. Will the World-Honored One, with his great compassion, not condescend to take pity on me?"

The Buddha knew his intention and immediately addressed Śāriputra: "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

## Śāriputra Declines

Śāriputra addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, I was sitting in meditation¹ beneath a tree in the forest. At that time, Vimalakirti came and said to me:

"'Ah, Śāriputra! This sitting is not necessarily meditation. True meditation² means not manifesting body or mind in the three realms—this is meditation. Not arising from the absorption of cessation³ yet manifesting all deportments—this is meditation. Not abandoning the way of Dharma yet engaging in mundane affairs—this is meditation. The mind not abiding within nor being without—this is meditation. Not being moved by any views yet practicing the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment⁴—this is meditation. Not cutting off afflictions yet entering nirvāṇa—this is meditation. One who can sit thus is approved by the Buddha.'

"At that time—World-Honored One!—hearing these words, I remained silent and could not reply. Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

## Mahāmaudgalyāyana Declines

The Buddha addressed Mahāmaudgalyāyana:⁵ "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

Maudgalyāyana addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, I entered the great city of Vaiśālī and was expounding the Dharma to the householders in the lanes. At that time, Vimalakirti came and said to me:

"'Ah, Great Maudgalyāyana! When expounding the Dharma to white-robed householders, you should not teach as you have been teaching. One who expounds the Dharma should expound it according to the Dharma.⁶

"'The Dharma is without sentient beings, because it is free from the defilement of sentient beings. The Dharma is without self, because it is free from the defilement of self. The Dharma is without life-span, because it is free from birth and death. The Dharma is without persons, because the prior and subsequent moments are cut off.⁷ The Dharma is constantly quiescent, because all characteristics are extinguished. The Dharma is apart from characteristics, because there is no object of apprehension. The Dharma is without name or word, because verbal expression is cut off.⁸ The Dharma is without explanation, because it is free from thought and examination. The Dharma is without form, because it is like empty space. The Dharma is without conceptual proliferation,⁹ because it is ultimately empty. The Dharma is without "mine," because it is free from "mine." The Dharma is without discrimination, because it is free from all consciousnesses.¹⁰ The Dharma is without comparison, because there is nothing relative to it. The Dharma does not belong to causes, because it is not located in conditions.¹¹ The Dharma is identical with dharma-nature; it enters all dharmas. The Dharma accords with thusness; there is nothing it accords with. The Dharma abides at the true limit;¹² the various extremes do not move it. The Dharma is without movement or disturbance; it does not depend on the six sense-objects. The Dharma is without coming or going; it constantly does not abide. The Dharma conforms to emptiness, accords with signlessness, responds to wishlessness.¹³ The Dharma is apart from beauty and ugliness. The Dharma is without increase or decrease. The Dharma is without birth or extinction. The Dharma has no destination. The Dharma transcends eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. The Dharma is without high or low. The Dharma constantly abides without moving. The Dharma is apart from all conditioned practice.

"'Ah, Great Maudgalyāyana! The characteristic of Dharma being thus, how can it be spoken? One who expounds the Dharma neither speaks nor demonstrates; one who listens to the Dharma neither hears nor attains. It is like a conjurer¹⁴ expounding the Dharma to conjured beings—one should establish this understanding when expounding the Dharma.

"'You should understand that the faculties of sentient beings have sharp and dull capacities. Be skillful in knowing and seeing without obstruction. With the mind of great compassion, praise the Mahāyāna. Be mindful to repay the Buddha's kindness and not let the Three Jewels be cut off—only then should you expound the Dharma.'

"When Vimalakirti expounded this Dharma, eight hundred householders generated the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. I do not have this eloquence. Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

## Mahākāśyapa Declines

The Buddha addressed Mahākāśyapa:¹⁵ "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

Mahākāśyapa addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, I was begging for alms in the poor quarter. At that time, Vimalakirti came and said to me:

"'Ah, Mahākāśyapa! You have the mind of loving-kindness and compassion, yet you are not universal in applying it—you bypass the wealthy and beg from the poor.¹⁶ Kāśyapa! Abide in the Dharma of equality and beg for food in proper sequence. Because you do not need to eat, you should beg for food. In order to destroy the characteristic of composite unity,¹⁷ you should receive morsels. Because you do not receive, you should accept their food.

"'Enter the village with the perception of an empty aggregation.¹⁸ Regard the forms you see the same as a blind man sees. Regard the sounds you hear the same as an echo. Regard the fragrances you smell the same as the wind. Regard the tastes you eat without discrimination. Accept all tangible objects as if they were cognitive wisdom. Know all dharmas to be illusory in nature—without self-nature, without other-nature, originally not being so, and even now without extinction.¹⁹

"'Kāśyapa! If you can avoid rejecting the eight deviations²⁰ and enter the eight liberations,²¹ using deviant characteristics to enter the true Dharma; if with a single meal you can make offerings to all, making offerings to all buddhas and the assemblies of noble sages, and only then eat—eating in this way, you are neither with afflictions nor apart from afflictions, neither entering concentration nor arising from concentration, neither dwelling in the worldly nor dwelling in nirvāṇa. Those who give to you will have neither great merit nor small merit—it neither benefits them nor harms them. This is correctly entering the Buddha-Way, not relying on the way of the śrāvakas.²² Kāśyapa! If you eat in this way, you do not vainly consume people's alms-offerings.'

"At that time—World-Honored One!—hearing these words, I experienced what I had never experienced before, and I immediately arose profound respect for all bodhisattvas. I further thought: 'This one bearing a householder's name²³ has such eloquence and wisdom! Who, hearing this, would not generate the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*?' From then on, I no longer encouraged people to follow the ways of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas.²⁴ Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

## Subhūti Declines

The Buddha addressed Subhūti:²⁵ "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

Subhūti addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, I entered his house to beg for food. At that time, Vimalakirti took my bowl, filled it with rice, and said to me:

"'Ah, Subhūti! If you can be equal regarding food, then all dharmas are also equal. If all dharmas are equal, then you are also equal regarding food.²⁶ Begging in this way, you may take the food.

"'Subhūti! If you do not cut off lust, anger, and delusion, yet are not bound by them; if you do not destroy the body yet accord with the single characteristic;²⁷ if you do not extinguish delusion and craving yet give rise to insight and liberation;²⁸ if with the characteristics of the five grave offenses you attain liberation,²⁹ yet are neither liberated nor bound; if you do not see the Four Noble Truths, yet it is not that you have not seen the truths; if you do not attain the fruits, yet it is not that you have not attained the fruits; if you are neither an ordinary person nor apart from the dharmas of ordinary persons; if you are neither a sage nor not a sage; if, though you accomplish all dharmas, you are apart from the characteristics of all dharmas—then you may take the food.

"'If, Subhūti, you do not see the Buddha and do not hear the Dharma—if those six heterodox teachers,³⁰ Pūraṇa Kāśyapa, Maskarin Gośālīputra, Sañjayin Vairaṭīputra, Ajita Keśakambala, Kakuda Kātyāyana, and Nirgrantha Jñātṛputra—if these are your teachers, and you leave home following them, and wherever those teachers fall, you also fall—then you may take the food.

"'If, Subhūti, you enter wrong views and do not reach the other shore; if you dwell in the eight difficulties³¹ and do not attain freedom from difficulty; if you are identified with afflictions and separated from pure dharmas; if you attain the samādhi of non-contention,³² yet all sentient beings also attain this samādhi; if those who give to you are not called a field of merit; if those who make offerings to you fall into the three evil paths; if you join hands with Māra and make all distressed ones your companions; if you are no different from all māras and all afflictions; if you have enmity toward all sentient beings, slander all buddhas, and destroy the Dharma; if you are not numbered among the assembly and will never attain final nirvāṇa—if you are thus, then you may take the food.'

"At that time—World-Honored One!—hearing these words, I was bewildered,³³ not understanding what he was saying or how to reply. I set down my bowl and wished to leave his house. Vimalakirti said:

"'Ah, Subhūti! Take your bowl—do not be afraid. What do you think? If a transformation-being³⁴ created by the Tathāgata were questioned about this matter, would he be afraid?'

"I said: 'No.'

"Vimalakirti said: 'All dharmas are like illusory transformations. You should have no fear now. Why is this so? All verbal expressions do not depart from this characteristic.³⁵ As for the wise, they are not attached to words and therefore have no fear. Why is this so? The nature of words is empty—there are no words. This is liberation. The characteristic of liberation is the characteristic of all dharmas.'

"When Vimalakirti expounded this Dharma, two hundred devas attained the pure Dharma-eye. Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

---

## Pūrṇa Declines

The Buddha addressed Pūrṇamatrāyaṇīputra:³⁶ "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

Pūrṇa addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, I was in the great forest³⁷ beneath a tree, expounding the Dharma to some newly-ordained bhikṣus. At that time, Vimalakirti came and said to me:

"'Ah, Pūrṇa! First you should enter samādhi and observe the minds of these persons, then expound the Dharma. Do not place defiled food in a precious vessel.³⁸ You should know what these bhikṣus are thinking. Do not confuse lapis lazuli with crystal.³⁹ You cannot know the roots and sources of sentient beings—do not presume to give rise to the Hīnayāna Dharma.⁴⁰ They themselves are without wounds—do not wound them. Those wishing to walk the great path should not be shown the small path. Do not put the great ocean into an ox's hoofprint. Do not treat sunlight the same as the light of a firefly.

"'Pūrṇa! These bhikṣus long ago generated the Mahāyāna mind but in the middle forgot this intention. Why do you instruct them with the Hīnayāna Dharma? I observe that the wisdom of the Hīnayāna is shallow and petty, like a blind person unable to distinguish the sharp and dull faculties of sentient beings.'

"At that time, Vimalakirti immediately entered samādhi and caused those bhikṣus to know their former lives:⁴¹ they had planted roots of merit under five hundred buddhas and had dedicated them toward *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. Immediately their realization was clear, and they regained their original minds. Thereupon all the bhikṣus bowed at Vimalakirti's feet. At that time, Vimalakirti expounded the Dharma to them, and they became irreversible from *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*.

"I thought that śrāvakas who do not observe the faculties of people should not teach the Dharma. Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

---

## Mahākātyāyana Declines

The Buddha addressed Mahākātyāyana:⁴² "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

Kātyāyana addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, after the Buddha briefly expounded the essential teachings to the bhikṣus, I afterward elaborated on their meaning—the meaning of impermanence, the meaning of suffering, the meaning of emptiness, the meaning of non-self, the meaning of quiescence.⁴³ At that time, Vimalakirti came and said to me:

"'Ah, Kātyāyana! Do not use the mind of arising and ceasing⁴⁴ to explain the Dharma of true reality.⁴⁵ Kātyāyana! All dharmas ultimately neither arise nor cease—this is the meaning of impermanence.⁴⁶ The five appropriated aggregates,⁴⁷ penetrated through, are empty and without arising—this is the meaning of suffering.⁴⁸ All dharmas ultimately have nothing whatsoever—this is the meaning of emptiness.⁴⁹ Self and no-self are not two—this is the meaning of non-self.⁵⁰ The Dharma originally was not so, and even now is without extinction—this is the meaning of quiescence.'⁵¹

"When he expounded this Dharma, all those bhikṣus liberated their minds. Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

---

## Aniruddha Declines

The Buddha addressed Aniruddha:⁵² "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

Aniruddha addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, I was doing walking meditation in a certain place. At that time, a Brahmā-king named Śubhavyūha,⁵³ together with ten thousand Brahmās, emitting pure radiance, came to me, bowed with his head at my feet, and asked:

"'How far does the divine eye of Aniruddha see?'

"I immediately replied: 'Benevolent one! I see the entire trichiliocosm of Śākyamuni Buddha, as if viewing an āmalaka fruit⁵⁴ in the palm of my hand.'

"At that time, Vimalakirti came and said to me: 'Ah, Aniruddha! Does what the divine eye sees have the characteristic of conditioned activity or the characteristic of non-conditioned activity?⁵⁵ If it has the characteristic of conditioned activity, then it is the same as the five supernatural powers of the heterodox teachers. If it is the characteristic of non-conditioned activity, then it is the unconditioned and should not have seeing.'

"World-Honored One! At that time I remained silent. The Brahmās, hearing his words, experienced what they had never experienced before, and immediately bowed to him and asked: 'Who in the world truly possesses the divine eye?'

"Vimalakirti said: 'There is—the Buddha, the World-Honored One, possesses the true divine eye.⁵⁶ Constantly abiding in samādhi, he sees all buddha-lands without the characteristic of duality.'

"Thereupon, the Brahmā-king Śubhavyūha and his retinue of five hundred Brahmā-devas all generated the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. Having bowed at Vimalakirti's feet, they suddenly vanished. Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

---

## Upāli Declines

The Buddha addressed Upāli:⁵⁷ "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

Upāli addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, two bhikṣus had violated the Vinaya rules⁵⁸ and were ashamed to ask the Buddha. They came to ask me:

"'Upāli! We have violated the Vinaya and are truly ashamed. We dare not ask the Buddha. We hope you will resolve our doubts and regret so we may be freed from this fault.'

"I immediately explained to them according to the Dharma. At that time, Vimalakirti came and said to me:

"'Ah, Upāli! Do not add to the guilt of these two bhikṣus! You should directly eliminate it; do not disturb their minds. Why is this so? The nature of that guilt is not internal, not external, and not in between.⁵⁹ As the Buddha has said, when the mind is defiled, sentient beings are defiled; when the mind is pure, sentient beings are pure. The mind, too, is not internal, not external, and not in between. As the mind is, so too is the guilt-defilement; so too are all dharmas—not departing from thusness.⁶⁰

"'Upāli! When the mind-characteristic attains liberation, is there defilement or not?'

"I said: 'There is not.'

"Vimalakirti said: 'The mind-characteristic of all sentient beings being without defilement is also like this. Ah, Upāli! Delusive thinking is defilement; no delusive thinking is purity. Inversion is defilement; no inversion is purity. Grasping a self is defilement; not grasping a self is purity.

"'Upāli! All dharmas arise and cease without abiding, like illusion, like lightning.⁶¹ Dharmas do not wait for each other—they do not even abide for a single moment. All dharmas are false appearances, like a dream, like a flame, like the moon in water, like a reflection in a mirror—they arise from delusive thinking. One who knows this is called one who upholds the Vinaya. One who knows this is called one who has good understanding.'

"Thereupon the two bhikṣus said: 'Supreme wisdom! This is something Upāli cannot match—the foremost upholder of the Vinaya, yet he cannot speak thus!'⁶²

"I immediately replied: 'Setting aside the Tathāgata, no śrāvaka or bodhisattva can match his joyful eloquence—his wisdom and insight are so brilliant!'

"At that time, the two bhikṣus' doubt and regret were immediately removed. They generated the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi* and made this vow: 'May all sentient beings attain this eloquence!'

"Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

---

## Rāhula Declines

The Buddha addressed Rāhula:⁶³ "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

Rāhula addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, the elder's sons of Vaiśālī came to me, bowed with their heads at my feet, and asked:

"'Rāhula! You are the son of the Buddha. You renounced the position of a wheel-turning king and left home to pursue the Way. What benefits does leaving home have?'

"I immediately explained the benefits and merits of leaving home according to the Dharma. At that time, Vimalakirti came and said to me:

"'Ah, Rāhula! You should not speak of the benefits and merits of leaving home.⁶⁴ Why is this so? That which is without benefit and without merit—that is leaving home. The conditioned dharmas can be spoken of as having benefit and merit. But leaving home is the unconditioned dharma, and in the unconditioned there is no benefit and no merit.

"'Rāhula! Leaving home is being without this and without that, and without the middle between them.⁶⁵ It is apart from the sixty-two views,⁶⁶ abiding in nirvāṇa. It is what the wise accept and what the noble practice. It is conquering the hosts of māras, crossing beyond the five destinies, purifying the five eyes, attaining the five powers, and establishing the five faculties. It is not disturbing others and departing from various evils. It is crushing the heterodox teachers and transcending conventional designations. It is emerging from the mire without attachment, without "mine," without reception, without disturbance, cherishing inner joy, guarding others' minds, according with meditation, and departing from all faults. If one is able to be thus—this is true leaving home.'

"Then Vimalakirti said to the elder's sons: 'It is appropriate that you all leave home in the true Dharma together. Why is this so? It is hard to meet a buddha-age!'

"The elder's sons said: 'Elder! We have heard the Buddha say that if one's parents do not give permission, one cannot leave home.'

"Vimalakirti said: 'So it is! Then you should all generate the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*—this is leaving home, this is complete ordination.⁶⁷'

"At that time, thirty-two elder's sons all generated the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

---

## Ānanda Declines

The Buddha addressed Ānanda:⁶⁸ "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

Ānanda addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, when the World-Honored One's body had a slight illness and required cow's milk, I immediately took my bowl and went to stand at the gate of a great brahmin's house. At that time, Vimalakirti came and said to me:

"'Ah, Ānanda! Why are you standing here with your bowl in the early morning?'

"I said: 'Elder! The World-Honored One's body has a slight illness and requires cow's milk, so I have come here.'

"Vimalakirti said: 'Stop, stop, Ānanda! Do not say such things! The Tathāgata's body is a vajra body;⁶⁹ all evils have been cut off; all goodness has gathered together. What illness could there be? What affliction could there be?

"'Go silently, Ānanda! Do not slander the Tathāgata. Do not let others hear such coarse words. Do not let the great, powerfully-virtuous devas and the bodhisattvas who have come from other pure lands hear these words.

"'Ānanda! A wheel-turning sage-king, because of just a little merit, is free from illness.⁷⁰ How much more so the Tathāgata, whose immeasurable accumulated merit is universally victorious! Go, Ānanda! Do not make us receive such disgrace. If the heterodox teachers and brahmins were to hear these words, they would think: "How can he be called a teacher? He cannot save his own illness—how can he save the illnesses of others?" You should leave quickly and secretly—do not let others hear.

"'You should know, Ānanda, the bodies of all tathāgatas are the Dharma-body, not the body of thought and desire.⁷¹ The Buddha is the World-Honored One, transcending the three realms. The Buddha's body is without outflows—all outflows are exhausted. The Buddha's body is unconditioned—it does not fall within enumeration.⁷² Such a body—what illness could it have? What affliction could it have?'

"At that time—World-Honored One!—I was truly ashamed. Had I perhaps, being close to the Buddha, made an error in hearing?⁷³ Immediately I heard a voice from the sky saying: 'Ānanda! What the elder says is true. But it is because the Buddha has appeared in the five turbidities of the evil age⁷⁴ that he performs this practice to liberate sentient beings. Go, Ānanda! Take the milk and do not be ashamed.'

"World-Honored One! Such is Vimalakirti's wisdom and eloquence! Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

## Conclusion

Thus did all five hundred great disciples each explain to the Buddha the account of their own past encounter, describing what Vimalakirti had said, and all declared they were not capable of going to inquire about his illness.

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Footnotes

¹ **[Philosophical]** Sitting in meditation (宴坐, *dhyāna-niṣadya*). The term refers to formal seated meditation, the foundational practice of early Buddhism. Vimalakirti challenges the external form, pointing to the essence of meditation.

² **[Philosophical]** True meditation (宴坐). Vimalakirti redefines meditation away from sitting posture toward a non-dual state of being. His six definitions of meditation systematically deconstruct dualities: active/passive, mundane/transcendent, interior/exterior, views/practice, affliction/liberation.

³ **[Philosophical]** Absorption of cessation (滅定, *nirodha-samāpatti*). The highest meditative attainment in early Buddhism, in which all mental activity ceases. Vimalakirti's point: true meditation maintains liberation *while* engaging in activity, not by withdrawing from activity.

⁴ **[Philosophical]** Thirty-seven factors of enlightenment (三十七品, *saptatriṃśad-bodhipakṣika-dharmāḥ*). The complete Buddhist path. Vimalakirti says one can practice all these while remaining unmoved by views—practice without attachment.

⁵ **[Textual]** Mahāmaudgalyāyana (大目犍連, *Mahāmaudgalyāyana*). "Great Moggallāna." The foremost disciple in supernatural powers. His teaching is rebuked for not according with the Dharma's true nature.

⁶ **[Philosophical]** **KEY THEME**: Dharma according to Dharma. This begins one of the sutra's most profound philosophical passages: a systematic via negativa describing what Dharma truly is by denying all predicates. The twenty-plus characteristics listed form a complete deconstruction of conceptual categories.

⁷ **[Philosophical]** Prior and subsequent moments cut off (前後際斷). Time dissolves under analysis; there is no continuous "person" linking past to future.

⁸ **[Philosophical]** Verbal expression cut off (言語斷). The Dharma transcends language. **[Cross-reference]** This anticipates Chapter 9's teaching on non-duality and Vimalakirti's famous silence.

⁹ **[Philosophical]** Conceptual proliferation (戲論, *prapañca*). Mental elaboration that obscures reality. The Dharma is free from all such elaboration.

¹⁰ **[Philosophical]** Free from all consciousnesses (離諸識). Beyond the eight consciousnesses of Yogācāra philosophy.

¹¹ **[Philosophical]** Not in causes or conditions. The Dharma is not produced; it is not the effect of causes.

¹² **[Philosophical]** True limit (實際, *bhūta-koṭi*). The absolute reality where all distinctions end.

¹³ **[Philosophical]** Three gates of liberation (空、無相、無作; *śūnyatā*, *animitta*, *apraṇihita*). Emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness—the three samādhis leading to nirvāṇa.

¹⁴ **[Philosophical]** Conjurer and conjured beings (幻士幻人). **This powerful image undercuts the entire enterprise of teaching**: if both teacher and audience are illusory, what is teaching? The answer: teaching occurs, but without the solidity we attribute to it.

¹⁵ **[Textual]** Mahākāśyapa (大迦葉, *Mahākāśyapa*). "Great Kāśyapa." Foremost in ascetic practices (dhūtaguṇa), known for extreme austerity. The epitome of the dhūta-bhikṣu.

¹⁶ **[Philosophical]** Bypassing the wealthy and begging from the poor. Kāśyapa avoided wealthy homes out of discomfort with their offerings. Vimalakirti exposes this as partiality—a failure of true compassion, which is universal.

¹⁷ **[Philosophical]** Composite unity (和合相). The false appearance of unified selfhood. Eating mindfully deconstructs even the alms-round itself.

¹⁸ **[Philosophical]** Empty aggregation (空聚). The village perceived as empty of inherent existence—the aggregates themselves are empty "villages" with no self residing in them.

¹⁹ **[Philosophical]** Originally not being so (本自不然). A key Mādhyamika formula: phenomena never had inherent existence; there was never anything to be destroyed. **[Cross-reference]** This echoes the Heart Sutra's "no ignorance and no extinction of ignorance."

²⁰ **[Textual]** Eight deviations (八邪). Wrong view, thought, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration—opposites of the Noble Eightfold Path.

²¹ **[Textual]** Eight liberations (八解脫, *aṣṭau vimokṣāḥ*). Progressive meditative attainments culminating in the cessation of perception and feeling.

²² **[Philosophical]** Not relying on the śrāvaka way. Kāśyapa's previous approach was śrāvaka-style: seeking personal liberation through asceticism. The bodhisattva way transforms every action into benefit for all.

²³ **[Philosophical]** Bearing a householder's name (有家名). Emphasis that Vimalakirti is "just a layman" with such profound realization—astounding.

²⁴ **[Philosophical]** Pratyekabuddha (辟支佛, *pratyekabuddha*). "Solitary Buddha." One who attains awakening alone without teaching others. Like śrāvakas, they represent limited realization from the Mahāyāna perspective.

²⁵ **[Textual]** Subhūti (須菩提, *Subhūti*). Foremost in understanding emptiness, the master of *śūnyatā*. His encounter with Vimalakirti is especially rich, as both are specialists in emptiness.

²⁶ **[Philosophical]** Equality regarding food and dharmas. For one who realizes emptiness, there is no distinction between food and all phenomena—all equally empty, equally real.

²⁷ **[Philosophical]** Single characteristic (一相). The characteristic of no characteristic—*nirākāra*.

²⁸ **[Philosophical]** Insight and liberation (明脫). Not through cutting off delusion, but through seeing through it.

²⁹ **[Philosophical]** Five grave offenses (五逆). Killing father, mother, or an arhat; shedding a buddha's blood; creating schism in the saṅgha. These are the most serious karmic offenses. Vimalakirti says even through these characteristics one can be liberated—ultimate non-attachment transcends even karma.

³⁰ **[Textual]** Six heterodox teachers. The six non-Buddhist teachers contemporary with the Buddha, representing materialist, fatalist, amoralist, and skeptical positions. Vimalakirti's point: if you're truly empty, what difference is there?

³¹ **[Textual]** Eight difficulties (八難). The conditions making Dharma-encounter difficult.

³² **[Philosophical]** Samādhi of non-contention (無諍三昧, *araṇa-samādhi*). Subhūti's specialty—perfect peace without conflict.

³³ **[Philosophical]** Bewildered (茫然). Subhūti, the emptiness-master, is stunned by Vimalakirti's paradoxical statements. The teaching uses negation to push beyond conceptual understanding.

³⁴ **[Philosophical]** Transformation-being (化人). An illusory person created by a buddha's power. If such a being were questioned, it would not fear because it knows it has no substantial existence.

³⁵ **[Philosophical]** All verbal expressions do not depart from this characteristic. Language itself is empty—words are just as illusory as the conjured beings mentioned earlier. Liberation is the nature of words themselves.

³⁶ **[Textual]** Pūrṇamatrāyaṇīputra (富樓那彌多羅尼子, *Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇīputra*). "Pūrṇa, son of Maitrāyaṇī." Foremost in preaching the Dharma.

³⁷ **[Textual]** The great forest (大林). The Mahāvana near Vaiśālī.

³⁸ **[Philosophical]** Defiled food in a precious vessel. Inappropriate to put Hīnayāna teachings into minds capable of Mahāyāna realization.

³⁹ **[Philosophical]** Lapis lazuli and crystal. Don't treat the precious as ordinary. These bhikṣus are Mahāyāna vessels mistakenly treated as Hīnayāna.

⁴⁰ **[Philosophical]** Hīnayāna Dharma (小乘法). The "Lesser Vehicle"—here referring to teachings focused on personal liberation rather than bodhisattva-hood.

⁴¹ **[Philosophical]** Knowing former lives. Through his samādhi, Vimalakirti reveals the bhikṣus' past-life aspirations, awakening their dormant Mahāyāna spirit.

⁴² **[Textual]** Mahākātyāyana (摩訶迦旃延, *Mahākātyāyana*). Foremost in detailed analytical exposition of the Buddha's terse teachings.

⁴³ **[Philosophical]** Five meanings. Kātyāyana's standard Abhidharma expositions: impermanence, suffering, emptiness, non-self, quiescence. Vimalakirti re-interprets each in Mahāyāna terms.

⁴⁴ **[Philosophical]** Mind of arising and ceasing (生滅心行). Conventional thinking that sees phenomena as truly arising and ceasing. This is the obstacle.

⁴⁵ **[Philosophical]** Dharma of true reality (實相法). *Dharmatā*—reality as it is, beyond arising and ceasing.

⁴⁶ **[Philosophical]** **REINTERPRETATION OF IMPERMANENCE**: Impermanence does not mean things arise and pass away; rather, nothing ever truly arises or ceases. This is the Mādhyamika understanding.

⁴⁷ **[Philosophical]** Five appropriated aggregates (五受陰, *pañcopādāna-skandha*). Form, feeling, perception, formations, consciousness as grasped at.

⁴⁸ **[Philosophical]** **REINTERPRETATION OF SUFFERING**: Suffering is not phenomenal distress but the emptiness of the aggregates themselves.

⁴⁹ **[Philosophical]** **REINTERPRETATION OF EMPTINESS**: Not the analytical absence of self, but ultimate non-existence of all dharmas.

⁵⁰ **[Philosophical]** **REINTERPRETATION OF NON-SELF**: Not merely the absence of a self in phenomena, but the non-duality of self and non-self.

⁵¹ **[Philosophical]** **REINTERPRETATION OF QUIESCENCE**: Not the cessation of something that existed, but recognition that nothing ever needed to be extinguished.

⁵² **[Textual]** Aniruddha (阿那律, *Aniruddha*). Foremost in the divine eye (天眼, *divya-cakṣus*).

⁵³ **[Textual]** Śubhavyūha (嚴淨, *Śubhavyūha*). "Splendid Array." A Brahmā-king.

⁵⁴ **[Textual]** Āmalaka fruit (菴摩勒果). The emblic myrobalan, a small Indian fruit often used as an example of something seen clearly.

⁵⁵ **[Philosophical]** Conditioned vs. unconditioned characteristic. Vimalakirti's incisive question: if seeing is conditioned (mental), it's merely mundane power; if unconditioned, there should be no seeing. This exposes the logical limits of Aniruddha's claim.

⁵⁶ **[Philosophical]** True divine eye. The Buddha's seeing is beyond the duality of conditioned/unconditioned—he sees all buddha-lands without dual characteristics.

⁵⁷ **[Textual]** Upāli (優波離, *Upāli*). Foremost in Vinaya (discipline). His specialty is rules; Vimalakirti transcends rules.

⁵⁸ **[Textual]** Vinaya rules (律行). The monastic code. The two bhikṣus' violation is unspecified.

⁵⁹ **[Philosophical]** Not internal, external, or in between. The standard Mādhyamika negation of location. Guilt, like all dharmas, is unfindable.

⁶⁰ **[Philosophical]** Not departing from thusness (不出於如如). All phenomena—including guilt—are expressions of thusness (*tathatā*). Nothing falls outside reality.

⁶¹ **[Philosophical]** Like illusion, like lightning. Standard images for impermanence and insubstantiality.

⁶² **[Philosophical]** The Vinaya master cannot match this understanding. The irony: the discipline-specialist lacks the wisdom to truly resolve guilt. True Vinaya is understanding the empty nature of transgression itself.

⁶³ **[Textual]** Rāhula (羅睺羅, *Rāhula*). The Buddha's son; foremost in inconspicuous practice (密行).

⁶⁴ **[Philosophical]** Benefits of leaving home. Rāhula's conventional answer focused on the merit of renunciation. Vimalakirti points to leaving home as unconditioned—beyond benefit.

⁶⁵ **[Philosophical]** Without this, that, or middle. Complete non-duality—no here, there, or between.

⁶⁶ **[Textual]** Sixty-two views (六十二見). The wrong views catalogued in early Buddhism, mostly variations on eternalism and annihilationism.

⁶⁷ **[Philosophical]** **REVOLUTIONARY TEACHING**: Generating bodhicitta IS leaving home. One need not physically leave family if one generates the awakening mind. This redefines ordination as internal transformation, accessible to laypeople.

⁶⁸ **[Textual]** Ānanda (阿難, *Ānanda*). The Buddha's attendant; foremost in hearing and memory. His encounter reveals the highest teaching on the Buddha's body.

⁶⁹ **[Philosophical]** Vajra body (金剛之體). The indestructible body of the Buddha. Vimalakirti insists that it is a mistake to speak of the Buddha as having ordinary illness.

⁷⁰ **[Philosophical]** Wheel-turning king free from illness. Even mundane merit protects from disease; how much more the Buddha's infinite merit?

⁷¹ **[Philosophical]** **KEY DOCTRINE**: Dharma-body, not the body of thought and desire. The Buddha's true body is the Dharma-body (*dharmakāya*)—unconditioned, beyond form. This teaching on the Buddha's nature is foundational for Mahāyāna Buddhology.

⁷² **[Philosophical]** Does not fall within enumeration (不墮諸數). The Buddha's body is beyond categorization—it cannot be counted among beings or phenomena.

⁷³ **[Textual]** Error in hearing. Ānanda, famous for hearing perfectly, here doubts himself.

⁷⁴ **[Textual]** Five turbidities (五濁). The five degenerations of the evil age: kalpa-turbidity, affliction-turbidity, sentient-being turbidity, view-turbidity, and life-span turbidity.

### Key Concepts

**Dharma Combat (辯論)**: Each encounter between Vimalakirti and a disciple is a form of "dharma combat"—a verbal exchange that exposes limitations and catalyzes deeper realization. The disciples are not defeated but educated; their humility shows spiritual maturity.

**The Superior Layman**: The chapter systematically establishes Vimalakirti's superiority over all the Buddha's foremost disciples—each renowned for a particular specialty. This makes a powerful statement about the potential for lay awakening and the limitations of specialized spiritual attainments.

**Non-Dual Understanding**: Each teaching Vimalakirti offers transcends dualities that the disciples still unconsciously maintain: sitting/not-sitting, pure/impure, wealthy/poor, views/practice, guilt/innocence, leaving home/staying home, healthy/ill.

**The True Nature of Dharma**: Maudgalyāyana's encounter contains a complete Mādhyamika philosophy of language and reality—the Dharma is beyond all predicates yet is expressed in all phenomena.
