## How the Story Got Told

This is what I heard:

One time, the Boss¹ was staying in a mango grove near Vaiśālī, and he had a crowd with him—eight thousand monks and thirty-two thousand bodhisattvas.² Now these bodhisattvas, they weren't no beginners. They'd been walking this road a long time, and everybody knew their names. They had that deep wisdom, that fundamental practice all locked down. The buddhas themselves had set them up, made them strong. They were the ones protecting the Dharma, holding down the truth. When they spoke, it was like a lion's roar—you could hear it ten directions out. They didn't wait to be asked; they just came alongside folks and gave them comfort. They kept the Three Jewels³ going, made sure the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha never died out. They'd beaten down the devil and all his tricks, put all them false teachers in their place, and they were clean—I mean really clean, free from all that mess that tangles people up. Their minds stayed steady in that freedom that ain't got no walls around it. They had mindfulness, concentration, that power to hold the teachings, and they could speak the truth without stumbling. Giving, keeping their word, patience, hard work, meditation, wisdom, and knowing how to meet folks where they are—they had all that down. They'd reached that place where they understood ain't nothing really being born or dying.⁴ They were turning that wheel that can't be turned back. They knew how the Dharma works, and they knew what folks needed. They covered the whole assembly with fearlessness, merit, and wisdom, and that's how they cultivated their minds. They had them marks on their bodies, them signs of all the good they'd done. They'd given up all the world's fancy dress. Their reputation was higher than the highest mountain. Their faith was solid as diamond. The Dharma-jewel shined out from them like light, raining down that sweet dew of truth. When they spoke, it was the most beautiful sound you ever heard. They'd gone deep into how everything depends on everything else, and they'd cut off all them wrong views—thinking things either exist forever or don't exist at all. They spoke the Dharma without fear, like that lion's roar. When they preached, it was like thunder rolling. They were beyond measure, past all measuring. They'd gathered up all the Dharma-jewels, like captains who know the ocean. They understood the deep meaning of all things. They knew where folks were coming from and where they were going, what their minds were up to. They were close to the Buddha's own wisdom, them ten powers, that fearlessness, them eighteen things only a buddha's got. They shut the gates to hell, but they showed up in all five realms⁵ to help folks. They were like the best doctors, healing every sickness, giving folks the medicine they needed and making sure they took it. They'd accomplished immeasurable merit; they'd purified immeasurable buddha-lands. Anybody who saw them or heard them got blessed. Nothing they did was wasted. All them merits—they had them all.

Their names were: Equal Vision, Unequal Vision, Equal-Unequal Vision, King of Concentration, King of Dharma, Dharma-Mark, Light-Mark, Light-Adornment, Great Adornment, Jewel-Accumulation, Eloquence-Accumulation, Jewel-Hand, Jewel-Seal-Hand, Constantly-Raised-Hand, Constantly-Lowered-Hand, Constant Sorrow, Joyful Root, Joyful King, Eloquent Voice, Space-Treasury, Jewel-Torch-Bearer, Jewel-Courage, Jewel-Vision, Indra's Net, Bright Net, Unconditioned Contemplation, Wisdom-Accumulation, Jewel-Victory, Heavenly King, Māra-Destroyer, Lightning-Virtue, Sovereign King, Merit-Mark-Adornment, Lion's Roar, Thunder-Sound, Mountain-Striking-Sound, Fragrant Elephant, White Fragrant Elephant, Constant Vigor, Never Resting, Wonderful Birth, Flower Adornment, Observer of the World's Sounds,⁶ Great Strength, Brahmā's Net, Jewel-Staff, Invincible, Land-Adorner, Golden Topknot, Pearl Topknot, Maitreya,⁷ and Mañjuśrī⁸—thirty-two thousand of them all told.

And there were ten thousand Brahmā-kings who'd come from other worlds to hear the teaching. Twelve thousand Śakras⁹ came too, from other worlds, to sit in the assembly. And all them other powerful beings—gods, dragons, spirits, musicians, titans, bird-spirits, horse-headed singers, great serpents—they all came to sit down. The monks, the nuns, the laymen, the laywomen—everybody came. The Buddha was surrounded by this immeasurable crowd, hundreds of thousands of them, all showing respect, and he was teaching them the Dharma. He was like that great mountain rising up out of the ocean, sitting on his lion-throne all decorated with jewels, outshining everybody there.

## The Young Man's Offering

Now at that time, in the city of Vaiśālī, there was this young man, son of an elder, name of Jewel-Accumulation. He came to see the Buddha with five hundred other young men, all of them carrying these jeweled canopies. They bowed down at the Buddha's feet, and each one offered up their canopy to worship him. And through the Buddha's spiritual power, all them canopies merged into one big canopy that covered the whole universe—I mean the whole trichiliocosm,¹⁰ billion worlds and all. You could see the whole thing in that canopy. All the mountains—Sumeru, the Snow Mountains, all of them—the oceans, rivers, streams, springs, the sun, moon, and stars, the palaces of the gods and dragons and spirits—all of it appeared in that jeweled canopy. And not just that—the buddhas of the ten directions and their teaching, that appeared in there too.

When everybody saw the Buddha's spiritual power, they sighed. They'd never seen nothing like it. They put their palms together, bowed to the Buddha, looked up at his face, and couldn't take their eyes off him. Then that young man Jewel-Accumulation spoke up in verse before the Buddha:

> "Your eyes are pure, long and wide like blue lotus flowers,  
> Your mind is pure, done crossed all them meditative states,  
> You been accumulating pure karma so long, they call it immeasurable,  
> Leading folks to that quiet place—to you I bow my head.  
>   
> We done seen the Great Sage's spiritual transformations,  
> Showing us immeasurable lands in all ten directions,  
> Where all them buddhas are teaching the Dharma—  
> In this, we see it all, we hear it all.  
>   
> The Dharma-King's Dharma-power goes beyond all beings,  
> Always giving out that Dharma-wealth to everybody,  
> Knowing how to tell the difference between all things,  
> But not moving when it comes to ultimate truth—  
> You got sovereignty over all dharmas,  
> That's why I bow to this Dharma-King.  
>   
> You teach the Dharma, not saying it exists or don't exist,  
> Through causes and conditions all things arise,  
> No self, no maker, nobody receiving,  
> But the karma of good and evil, that don't get lost.  
>   
> First at the Bodhi-tree, you beat down the devil with power,  
> Got that sweet dew's extinction, accomplished the enlightened Way,  
> Already without mind or thought, without grabbing or doing,  
> But you completely crushed all them false teachers.  
>   
> Three times you turned that Dharma-wheel in the great universe,  
> That wheel was pure from the beginning, always been pure,  
> Gods and humans getting the Way—that's the proof,  
> The Three Jewels showing up in the world.  
>   
> With this sublime Dharma you saving all beings,  
> Once they receive it, they don't fall back, stay quiet,  
> Crossing old age, sickness, and death—Great Physician-King,  
> We should bow to the Dharma-ocean's virtue that got no end.  
>   
> Praise or blame don't move you, like Mount Sumeru,  
> Toward good and not-good, you equal with compassion,  
> Your mind practicing equality like empty space—  
> Who gonna hear about this human jewel and not receive it with respect?  
>   
> Now I'm offering the World-Honored One this humble canopy,  
> And in it appears my whole universe,  
> The palaces where the gods, dragons, and spirits live,  
> The musicians and spirits too.  
>   
> Everything that exists in the world, we see it,  
> The Ten Powers showing this transformation out of compassion,  
> Everybody seeing what they never seen before, all praising the Buddha—  
> Now I bow to the Honored One of the Three Realms.  
>   
> The Great Sage Dharma-King, everybody returns to him,  
> With pure mind looking at the Buddha, everybody delighted,  
> Each one seeing the World-Honored One right in front of them—  
> This is spiritual power, one of them uncommon qualities.  
>   
> The Buddha speaks with one voice,  
> But sentient beings, according to their type, each one understands,  
> All of them thinking the World-Honored One speaks their language—  
> This is spiritual power, one of them uncommon qualities.  
>   
> The Buddha speaks with one voice,  
> But sentient beings, each according to their understanding,  
> All receiving it, practicing it, getting benefit—  
> This is spiritual power, one of them uncommon qualities.  
>   
> The Buddha speaks with one voice,  
> Some get fearful, some get joyful,  
> Some start letting go, some cut through their doubt—  
> This is spiritual power, one of them uncommon qualities.  
>   
> I bow to the Ten Powers' great vigor,  
> I bow to those who got fearlessness,  
> I bow to those living in them uncommon qualities,  
> I bow to all the great guides,  
> I bow to those who can cut all bondage,  
> I bow to those who done reached the other shore,  
> I bow to those who can ferry all worlds,  
> I bow to those forever free from the road of birth and death.  
>   
> Knowing completely where sentient beings coming from and going to,  
> Skillful in all dharmas, getting liberation,  
> Not attached to the world like a lotus flower,  
> Always and skillfully entering that practice of emptiness and quiet,  
> Understanding the characteristics of all dharmas without obstruction—  
> I bow to you, like space, without no dependence."

## The Teaching on Pure Lands

After that young man Jewel-Accumulation spoke them verses, he said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, these five hundred young men, they all done generated that mind of supreme enlightenment.¹¹ They want to hear how to get a pure buddha-land. We're praying that the World-Honored One will explain what bodhisattvas got to do to purify lands!"

The Buddha said: "Excellent, Jewel-Accumulation! You asking the Tathāgata on behalf of the bodhisattvas about how to purify lands. Listen careful, listen careful! Think well on this, and I'm gonna explain it for you!" So Jewel-Accumulation and them five hundred young men received the teaching and listened.

The Buddha said: "Jewel-Accumulation! The various classes of sentient beings—they ARE the bodhisattva's buddha-land.¹² Why's that? A bodhisattva takes a buddha-land according to the sentient beings he transforms. A bodhisattva takes a buddha-land according to the sentient beings he tames. A bodhisattva takes a buddha-land according to what land sentient beings need to enter the Buddha's wisdom. A bodhisattva takes a buddha-land according to what land sentient beings need to wake up them bodhisattva faculties. Why's that? When a bodhisattva takes a pure land, it's entirely for the sake of benefiting all sentient beings. It's like a person who wants to build a palace on empty ground—he can do it however he wants, ain't nothing in the way. But if he tries to build it in empty space, he'll never get it done! Bodhisattvas are like this: in order to accomplish sentient beings, they vow to take a buddha-land. Vowing to take a buddha-land ain't building in emptiness.

"Jewel-Accumulation! You should know: An upright mind¹³ is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings who don't flatter and lie will be born in his land. A profound mind is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings full of merit will be born in his land. The mind of bodhi¹⁴ is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, Mahāyāna sentient beings will be born in his land. Giving is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings who can let go of everything will be born in his land. Keeping the precepts is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings practicing the ten wholesome actions and fulfilling their vows will be born in his land. Patience is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings adorned with them thirty-two marks will be born in his land. Hard work is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings diligently cultivating all merits will be born in his land. Meditation is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings with collected and undistracted minds will be born in his land. Wisdom is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings in right concentration will be born in his land. The four immeasurables¹⁵—loving-kindness, compassion, joy, and letting folks be—that's the bodhisattva's pure land. When the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings accomplished in these will be born in his land. The four ways of attracting folks¹⁶—giving, kind speech, helpful conduct, and working together—that's the bodhisattva's pure land. When the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings embraced by liberation will be born in his land. Skillful means is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings who ain't obstructed in skillful means regarding all dharmas will be born in his land. The thirty-seven factors of enlightenment¹⁷ are the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings practicing mindfulness, right effort, spiritual power, faculties, powers, enlightenment factors, and path-factors will be born in his land. Dedicating merit is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, he'll get a land full of all merits. Teaching folks how to avoid the eight difficulties¹⁸ is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, his land will be free from the three evil paths and the eight difficulties. Guarding your own conduct without criticizing others' faults is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, his land won't even have a name for breaking the rules. The ten wholesome actions are the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings whose lives ain't cut short, who are wealthy, who practice pure conduct, whose words are true, who always use gentle speech, whose relatives don't separate, who skillfully make peace in disputes, whose words necessarily benefit, who ain't jealous, ain't angry, and hold right views will be born in his land.

"So, Jewel-Accumulation! According to a bodhisattva's upright mind, he's able to generate practice. According to his generating practice, he gets a profound mind. According to his profound mind, his intention becomes tamed. According to the taming of his intention, he practices what he preaches. According to practicing what he preaches, he's able to dedicate merit. According to his dedication, he has skillful means. According to his skillful means, he accomplishes sentient beings. According to accomplishing sentient beings, the buddha-land becomes pure. According to the purity of the buddha-land, the Dharma-teaching becomes pure. According to the purity of Dharma-teaching, wisdom becomes pure. According to the purity of wisdom, the mind becomes pure. According to the purity of mind, all merits become pure. Therefore, Jewel-Accumulation! If a bodhisattva wants to get a pure land, he should purify his mind. According to the purity of his mind, the buddha-land becomes pure."¹⁹

## Śāriputra's Doubt and the Buddha's Response

At that time, Śāriputra,²⁰ empowered by the Buddha's spiritual power, had this thought: "If when a bodhisattva's mind is pure, the buddha-land becomes pure, then when our World-Honored One was formerly practicing as a bodhisattva, was his intention not pure? But this buddha-land is impure like this!"

The Buddha, knowing his thought, immediately said to him: "What you think? Are the sun and moon not pure, but the blind don't see them?"

He replied: "No, World-Honored One! This is the blind person's fault, not the fault of the sun and moon."

"Śāriputra! Because of sentient beings' transgressions, they don't see the Tathāgata's buddha-land's magnificent purity—it ain't the Tathāgata's fault. Śāriputra! This land of mine is pure, but you don't see it."

At that time, the Brahmā-king Spiral-Topknot said to Śāriputra: "Don't have that thought, thinking this buddha-land is impure. Why's that? I see Śākyamuni Buddha's land as pure, like the palace of the highest heaven."

Śāriputra said: "I see this land full of hills, valleys, pits, thorns, sand, gravel, earth, stone mountains, and filth."

The Brahmā-king Spiral-Topknot said: "Venerable one, your mind has highs and lows and don't rely on the Buddha's wisdom, that's why you see this land as impure! Śāriputra! Bodhisattvas are completely equal toward all sentient beings, their profound minds pure, relying on the Buddha's wisdom—then they're able to see this buddha-land as pure."

Then the Buddha pressed the earth with his toe, and immediately the whole universe was adorned with hundreds of thousands of jewels, like the Land of Immeasurable Merit and Jewel Adornment of the Buddha Jewel-Banner. The whole assembly sighed at this unprecedented marvel, and everybody saw themselves sitting on jeweled lotus flowers.

The Buddha told Śāriputra: "You see now this buddha-land's magnificent purity?"

Śāriputra said: "Indeed so, World-Honored One! What I never seen before, never heard before, the buddha-land's magnificent purity now all appears."

The Buddha said to Śāriputra: "My buddha-land is always pure like this. In order to save inferior people, I show this land full of various evils and impurities! It's like when the gods eat from jeweled vessels—according to their merit, the color of the food is different. Likewise, Śāriputra! If a person's mind is pure, he then sees this land's meritorious adornment."

When the Buddha showed this land's magnificent purity, them five hundred young men led by Jewel-Accumulation all got that patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas,²¹ and eighty-four thousand persons all generated the mind of supreme enlightenment. The Buddha withdrew his spiritual powers, and then this world went back to how it was before. Those seeking the Śrāvaka vehicle—thirty-two thousand gods and humans—knowing that conditioned dharmas are all impermanent, became far from dust and free from defilement, getting the pure Dharma-eye.²² Eight thousand monks, not grasping any dharmas, exhausted the outflows and liberated their minds.²³

## Endnotes

¹ **The Boss**: The Buddha. In the Blues tradition, "the Boss" or "the Man" refers to the ultimate authority, but here it's used with deep respect for the one who shows the way.

² **Bodhisattvas**: Folks on the road to becoming buddhas, but they ain't just walking for themselves—they walking for everybody. They vowed to get everybody across before they rest.

³ **Three Jewels**: The Buddha (the one who woke up), the Dharma (the truth he taught), and the Sangha (the community walking the path). These are what you take refuge in.

⁴ **Ain't nothing really being born or dying**: This is that deep realization that all things are empty of inherent existence. When you see this, you understand that birth and death are just appearances, not ultimate reality. The Blues knows about this—how suffering and joy both pass, how ain't nothing permanent to hold onto.

⁵ **Five realms**: Hell, hungry ghosts, animals, humans, and gods. Bodhisattvas show up in all of them to help folks, even though they're free and don't have to.

⁶ **Observer of the World's Sounds**: Avalokiteśvara, the bodhisattva of compassion. Hears every cry for help and responds. The Blues understands this—somebody listening to your trouble, somebody who hears.

⁷ **Maitreya**: The future buddha. He's coming when the time is right, when this dispensation is done.

⁸ **Mañjuśrī**: The bodhisattva of wisdom. Got that sword that cuts through ignorance. He's gonna be Vimalakirti's main conversation partner in this sutra.

⁹ **Śakras**: Indras, kings of the gods. Twelve thousand of them from different worlds, showing how vast this assembly was.

¹⁰ **Trichiliocosm**: A billion-world system. When the Blues talks about the universe, it's talking BIG. This ain't just our little world—it's everything.

¹¹ **Supreme enlightenment**: *Anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. The highest awakening, what a buddha attains. These young men done set their hearts on it.

¹² **CENTRAL TEACHING - Sentient beings ARE the bodhisattva's buddha-land**: This is revolutionary. The pure land ain't some place far away you go to after you die. The pure land is made by purifying sentient beings. The land's purity depends on the people's purity, and the people's purity depends on the bodhisattva's practice. This means you can't separate the environment from the folks in it. You can't separate your practice from helping others. The Blues knows this—you can't get free by yourself. Your freedom is tied up with everybody else's freedom.

¹³ **Upright mind**: Being straight with folks, no flattery, no lying, no games. Just honest, sincere, straightforward. That's the foundation.

¹⁴ **Mind of bodhi**: The aspiration to wake up for the sake of all beings. This is what makes you a bodhisattva—not just wanting to get free yourself, but wanting everybody to get free.

¹⁵ **Four immeasurables**: Loving-kindness (wanting everybody to be happy), compassion (wanting everybody to be free from suffering), sympathetic joy (being happy when others are happy), and equanimity (letting folks be, not trying to control everything). These attitudes extend boundlessly to all beings.

¹⁶ **Four ways of attracting folks**: Giving (being generous), kind speech (talking gentle), helpful conduct (doing what benefits others), and working together (cooperating, being part of the team). This is how bodhisattvas draw folks to the Dharma.

¹⁷ **Thirty-seven factors of enlightenment**: The complete set of practices leading to awakening. Mindfulness, right effort, spiritual power, faculties, powers, enlightenment factors, and the eightfold path. All of it together.

¹⁸ **Eight difficulties**: Eight conditions that make it hard to encounter the Dharma: being born in hell, as a hungry ghost, as an animal, in a long-lived heaven, in a border region, with impaired faculties, with wrong views, or in a time without a buddha.

¹⁹ **CENTRAL TEACHING - According to the purity of mind, the buddha-land becomes pure**: This is the heart of it. The external world reflects the internal mind. You want a pure land? Purify your mind. This ain't just about perception—it's about how mind and world ain't two separate things. The Blues understands this deeply. The world you see is the world you make. Your inner state creates your outer reality. Clean up your heart, and you clean up your world.

²⁰ **Śāriputra**: One of the Buddha's foremost disciples, known for his wisdom. But in Mahāyāna sutras, he often represents the limited Śrāvaka perspective that needs to be transcended. He's looking for personal liberation, not understanding the bodhisattva's vision yet.

²¹ **Patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas**: A high bodhisattva attainment—direct realization that all phenomena are empty and don't truly arise. Once you get this, you ain't turning back.

²² **Pure Dharma-eye**: The first stage of realization in the Śrāvaka path, seeing the truth of the Four Noble Truths and entering the stream to nirvāṇa.

²³ **Exhausted the outflows and liberated their minds**: Complete arhatship—freedom from all mental defilements and liberation from rebirth. They done finished the work.

### Theological Notes

**The Pure Land Ain't Somewhere Else**: This chapter teaches that pure lands ain't external paradises you escape to. They arise from the bodhisattva's practice of purifying sentient beings. The land's purity is the people's purity. This is different from the devotional Pure Land schools that emphasize rebirth in Amitābha's Sukhāvatī through faith. The Vimalakirti Sutra says: you want a pure land? Get to work purifying beings. Your environment is your practice.

**Mind and World Ain't Two**: The teaching that "according to the purity of mind, the buddha-land becomes pure" shows that consciousness and environment ain't separate. This is the non-duality that's central to this whole sutra. The Blues knows this truth—the world you see depends on where you're standing, what you're carrying, how clear your vision is.

**Skillful Means**: The Buddha explains that he shows an impure land to save "inferior people." This is skillful means—adapting the teaching to folks' capacity. The same reality looks different depending on your spiritual development. This ain't deception; it's compassionate adaptation. The Blues does this too—meeting folks where they are, speaking their language.

**Bodhisattva Path vs. Personal Liberation**: The chapter contrasts the bodhisattva ideal (represented by them 32,000 bodhisattvas and Jewel-Accumulation) with the Śrāvaka path (represented by Śāriputra). Both get liberation, but bodhisattvas work to purify lands and save beings, while śrāvakas seek personal nirvāṇa. The Blues is with the bodhisattvas on this—you can't get free alone. Your liberation is bound up with everybody else's.
