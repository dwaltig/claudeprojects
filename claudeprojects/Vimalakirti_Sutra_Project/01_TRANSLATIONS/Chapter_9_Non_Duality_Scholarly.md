## The Bodhisattvas Speak

At that time, Vimalakirti spoke to the bodhisattvas: "Virtuous Ones! How does the bodhisattva enter the Dharma-door of non-duality (*advaya-dharma-paryāya*)? Let each speak according to what they prefer."

1.  **Dharma-Isvara (Dharma Sovereign)** said: "Virtuous Ones! Arising and Ceasing are two. The Dharma originally does not arise, and now it does not cease. Attaining this acceptance of non-arising (*anutpattika-dharma-kṣānti*) is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

2.  **Srigupta (Guardian of Virtue)** said: " 'I' and 'Mine' are two. Because there is 'I', there is 'Mine'. If there is no 'I', there is no 'Mine'. This is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

3.  **Animisa (Unblinking)** said: "Perception (*vedanā*) and non-perception are two. If dharmas are not perceived, they cannot be grasped. Because they cannot be grasped, there is no taking or rejecting, no fabrication and no activity. This is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

4.  **Devakuta (Incarnation of Virtue)** said: "Defilement (*mala*) and purity (*viśuddhi*) are two. Seeing the true nature of defilement, there is no mark of purity. Thus conforming to the mark of extinction is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

5.  **Sunetra (Good Eye)** said: "One mark (*ekalakṣaṇa*) and formlessness (*alakṣaṇa*) are two. If one knows that the one mark is precisely the formless, and one does not grasp the formless but enters into equality, this is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

6.  **Subahu (Wonderful Arm)** said: "The Bodhisattva-mind and the Śrāvaka-mind are two. Contemplating the characteristics of the mind as empty, like an illusion, there is no Bodhisattva-mind and no Śrāvaka-mind. This is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

7.  **Pusya** said: "Wholesome and Unwholesome are two. If one does not arouse wholesome or unwholesome, entering the limit of formlessness and penetrating it, this is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

8.  **Simha (Lion)** said: "Sin and Merit are two. If one penetrates the nature of sin (*pāpa*), it is not different from merit (*puṇya*). Using diamond-wisdom (*vajra-prajñā*) to definitively understand this characteristic, neither bound nor liberated, is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."¹

9.  **Simhamati (Lion Intention)** said: "Tainted (*sāsrava*) and Taintless (*anāsrava*) are two. If one attains the equality of dharmas, one does not generate the thought of tainted or taintless. Not adhering to characteristics, nor dwelling in formlessness—this is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

10. **Suddhadhimukti (Pure Understanding)** said: "Conditioned (*saṃskṛta*) and Unconditioned (*asaṃskṛta*) are two. If one separates from all enumeration, the mind is like empty space. Using pure wisdom without obstruction is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

11. **Narayana** said: "Worldly and Supramundane are two. The nature of the world is empty, which is precisely the supramundane. Within this, there is no entering, no exiting, no overflowing, no scattering. This is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

12. **Dantamati (Good Intention)** said: "Samsara and Nirvāṇa are two. If one sees the nature of Samsara, there is no Samsara. There is no bondage and no liberation, no burning and no extinction. Understanding in this way is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

13. **Pratyakshadharma (Manifest Sight)** said: "Exhaustible (*kṣaya*) and Inexhaustible (*akṣaya*) are two. Whether dharmas are ultimately exhausted or not exhausted, they constitute the mark of the inexhaustible. The mark of the inexhaustible is Emptiness (*śūnyatā*). Emptiness has no mark of exhaustible or inexhaustible. Entering in this way is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

14. **Parigupta (Universal Guardian)** said: "Self (*ātman*) and No-Self (*anātman*) are two. If the Self cannot be grasped, how can No-Self be grasped? One who sees the true nature of the self does not generate duality. This is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

15. **Vidyuddeva (Lightning God)** said: "Ignorance (*avidyā*) and Illumination (*vidyā*) are two. The true nature of ignorance is precisely illumination. Illumination also cannot be grasped. Separating from all numbers, equal and non-dual in the midst of this—this is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

16. **Priyadarsana (Joyful to See)** said: "Form (*rūpa*) and Emptiness of Form are two. Form is precisely emptiness; it is not that form is destroyed and then empty. The nature of form is itself empty. Likewise, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness are two [vis-a-vis their emptiness]. Consciousness is precisely emptiness; it is not that consciousness is destroyed and then empty. The nature of consciousness is itself empty. Penetrating this is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

17. **Prabhaketu (Light Sign)** said: "The differentiation of the four elements and the differentiation of the emptiness-element are two. The nature of the four elements is precisely the nature of the emptiness-element. Just as the past and future are empty, the present is also empty. Being able to know the nature of the elements in this way is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

18. **Pramati (Superior Mind)** said: "Eye and Form are two. If one knows the nature of the eye, one is not greedy, angry, or deluded regarding form. This is called tranquil extinction. Likewise Ear/Sound, Nose/Smell, Tongue/Taste, Body/Touch, Mind/Dharma are two. If one knows the nature of the mind, one is not greedy, angry, or deluded regarding dharmas. This is called tranquil extinction. Abiding peacefully in this is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

19. **Akshayamati (Inexhaustible Mind)** said: "Giving (*dāna*) and Dedication (*pariṇāmanā*) to Omniscience are two. The nature of giving is precisely the nature of dedication to Omniscience. Likewise, Discipline, Patience, Vigor, Meditation, Wisdom, and Dedication to Omniscience are two. The nature of Wisdom is precisely the nature of dedication to Omniscience. Entering into single-characteristic within this is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

20. **Gambhiramati (Deep Wisdom)** said: "Emptiness, Signlessness, and Wishlessness are two [i.e., distinguished from each other]. Emptiness is Signlessness. Signlessness is Wishlessness. If it is Empty, Signless, and Wishless, then there is no Mind, Thought, or Consciousness. liberation in one door is liberation in three doors. This is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

21. **Santendriya (Quiet Roots)** said: "Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha are two. The Buddha is precisely the Dharma. The Dharma is precisely the Sangha. These Three Jewels represent the unconditioned characteristic, equal to empty space. All dharmas are also like this. Being able to practice according to this is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

22. **Apratihatacitta (Unobstructed Mind)** said: "Body and Body-Extinction are two. The body is precisely the extinction of the body. Why? One who sees the true characteristic of the body does not give rise to [views of] the body or the extinction of the body. Body and extinction of body are non-dual and undifferentiated. Not fearng or dreading this is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

23. **Suvinita (Well-Disciplined)** said: "Body, Speech, and Mind karma are two. All three karma have the characteristic of non-action (*akṛta*). The characteristic of body non-action is the characteristic of speech non-action. The characteristic of speech non-action is the characteristic of mind non-action. The characteristic of non-action of these three karmas is the characteristic of non-action of all dharmas. Being able to follow this wisdom of non-action is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

24. **Punyaksetra (Field of Merit)** said: "Meritorious action, Sinful action, and Immovable action are two. The true nature of the three actions is Empty. Emptiness has no meritorious action, sinful action, or immovable action. Not generating these three actions is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

25. **Padmavyuha (Flower Ornament)** said: "Generated from the Self creates duality. One who sees the true characteristic of the Self does not generate dualistic dharmas. If one does not dwell in dualistic dharmas, there is no consciousness. Being without consciousness is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

26. **Srigarbha (Virtue Store)** said: "Characteristics of attainment are two. If there is no attainment, there is no taking or rejection. Being without taking or rejection is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

27. **Candrottara (Moon Superior)** said: "Darkness and Light are two. If there is no darkness and no light, there is no duality. Why? Like entering the concentration of cessation (*nirodha-samāpatti*), there is no darkness and no light. The characteristics of all dharmas are likewise. Entering equally into this is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

28. **Ratnamudrahasta (Jewel-Seal Hand)** said: "Delighting in Nirvana and not delighting in the World are two. If one does not delight in Nirvana and does not treat the world with aversion, there is no duality. Why? If there is bondage, there is liberation. If fundamentally there is no bondage, who seeks liberation? Without bondage or liberation, there is no delight or aversion. This is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

29. **Maniratuakuta (Jewel Topknot King)** said: "The Right Path and the Wrong Path are two. One who abides in the Right Path does not discriminate 'this is wrong' or 'this is right'. Separating from these two is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

30. **Satyarata (Delighting in Truth)** said: "True and Untrue are two. One who sees Truly does not even see the True, how much less the Untrue? Why? It is not seen with the fleshly eye; only the Wisdom Eye can see it. But this Wisdom Eye has no seeing and no not-seeing. This is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

## Manjushri's Answer

After all the bodhisattvas had spoken, they asked Mañjuśrī: "What is the bodhisattva's entry into the Dharma-door of non-duality?"

Mañjuśrī said: "According to my intention, with regard to all dharmas, there are no words, no speech, no demonstration, and no cognition. It is separated from all questions and answers. This is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

## The Thunderous Silence

Then Mañjuśrī asked Vimalakirti: "We have each spoken. Virtuous One, you should say: What is the bodhisattva's entry into the Dharma-door of non-duality?"

At that time, Vimalakirti remained silent and wordless.²

Mañjuśrī praised him, saying: "Excellent, excellent! Not to have even written words or language—this is truly entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

When this 'Entry into the Dharma-Door of Non-Duality' chapter was expounded, five thousand bodhisattvas in the assembly all entered the Dharma-door of non-duality and attained the acceptance of non-arising dharmas.

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Footnotes

1.  **Sin and Merit are two**: Simha Bodhisattva attacks the fundamental dualism of religious ethics. Usually, Buddhism encourages merit (*puṇya*) and discourages sin (*pāpa*). From the absolute perspective of non-duality, both are karma-producing activities rooted in self-view.
2.  **Silent and wordless**: *The* defining moment of the Sutra. The 30 Bodhisattvas used words to describe non-duality (negation). Mañjuśrī used words to describe the absence of words (apophatic theology). Vimalakirti *demonstrates* non-duality by engaging in the act itself. Silence is not just the absence of speech, but the presence of the Absolute.

### Commentary

This chapter structurally resembles a dialectical staircase.
1.  **The Bodhisattvas (Negation of Opposites)**: 30 Bodhisattvas negate specific dualisms (good/bad, samsara/nirvana, self/other). This is the level of *intellectual understanding*.
2.  **Mañjuśrī (Negation of Language)**: Mañjuśrī moves to the meta-level. The problem isn't just specific opposites, but language itself. "No questions and answers." This is the level of *contemplative silence*.
3.  **Vimalakirti (The Absolute)**: Vimalakirti transcends the description of silence. He embodies the *reality* to which the silence points. As the Zen tradition later put it: "Mañjuśrī is the teacher of seven Buddhas, but he still can't beat Vimalakirti's shut mouth."

### Key Terms

*   **Advaya (Non-duality)**: Not "one" (monism), but "not two." It signifies the transcending of binary oppositions without collapsing into a homogenous blob. Samsara is Nirvana, not because they are the same thing, but because the discrimination between them is empty.
*   **Anutpattika-dharma-kṣānti (Acceptance of Non-arising)**: A high-level bodhisattva realization. The mind ceases to vibrate with hope and fear because it sees that no dharma has ever truly arisen or ceased.
