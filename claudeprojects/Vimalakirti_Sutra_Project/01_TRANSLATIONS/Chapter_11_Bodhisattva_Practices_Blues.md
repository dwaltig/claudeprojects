# Chapter 11: Bodhisattva Practices (The Long Game)

**Blues Vernacular Translation by Master John Kim**

## 1. The Golden Hour

So there we was, back in the Garden. The Buddha was layin' it down, and suddenly—BAM! The whole world opened up. The ground turned to gold, the sky turned to gold, everything was shining like a brand new trumpet on a Sunday mornin'.

Ānanda, bless his heart, he’s always the first one to ask what’s goin’ on. He says, "Boss, what is this light? Why’s everything lookin’ like a treasury?"

The Boss says, "That ain't money, Ānanda. That’s Vimalakirti and Mañjuśrī comin’ through. They got a posse with 'em, and the intention alone is turning the dirt to gold."

Over in the city, Vimalakirti looks at Mañjuśrī and says, "Let's go pay our respects."

Mañjuśrī nods. "Right on time."

Now, watch this move. Vimalakirti doesn’t just call a cab. He picks up the whole assembly—the bodhisattvas, the arhats, the high-back chairs, the whole room—and he puts it right in the palm of his hand. Like he’s carryin’ a peach.

He flies 'em over to the Garden, sets 'em down gentle. He bows to the Boss, walks around him seven times—that’s respect—and stands to the side. All his people do the same. Indra, Brahma, the Heavenly Kings—they all fall in line.

The Boss settles everyone down, makes sure everybody’s comfortable. Then he looks at Śāriputra and says, "Did you see that? Did you see how the Big Man handles his business?"

Śāriputra shakes his head. "I saw it, Boss. But I don't understand it. It’s way above my pay grade. My brain just can’t compute that kind of move."

## 2. The Smell of Truth

Just then, Ānanda sniffs the air. "Whoa. What is that cologne? I ain't never smelled nothing like that in all my born days."

The Buddha smiles. "That’s the scent of the Bodhisattvas."

Śāriputra looks at his own arm. "Man, I count, too! My pores are leakin' this perfume!"

Ānanda says, "Where’d you get that?"

Śāriputra says, "It’s the rice, man! The Old Man brought takeout from the Fragrance Country. We all ate at his house, and now we all smell like heaven."

Ānanda asks Vimalakirti, "How long does the high last?"

Vimalakirti says, "Until the rice is digested."

"And when is that?"

"Seven days," says Vimalakirti. "But check this out. It ain't just digestion. It’s transformation.
"If a regular student eats this, it don't digest until he hits the Real Path.
"If he’s already on the Path, it don't digest until his mind breaks free.
"If he ain't thought about saving the world yet, it stays in his belly until that Big Mind wakes up.
"If he’s already got the Big Mind, it stays until he learns that nothing ever really dies.
"It’s like that medicine called 'Supreme Flavor'—it kills all the poison before it quits working. This rice kills the poison of your ego before it fades away."

Ānanda shakes his head. "That is some powerful rice. It acts like a Buddha."

The Boss nods. "You got that right, Ānanda.
"Some Buddhas do the work with light.
"Some do it with words.
"Some use shadows, echoes, dreams, and mirror-images.
"Some use food.
"Some use silence. Just straight-up quiet, and the work gets done.
"Every move a Buddha makes—eating, walking, breathing—it’s all the Work. Even the demons, Ānanda. Even the trouble, the headache, the 84,000 kinds of mesmerizing blues—the Buddha uses all of it to wake you up.
"A real player looks at a clean world and don't get proud. He looks at a dirty world and don't get sad. He just sees the game for what it is."

## 3. The Hustle of Exhaustible and Inexhaustible

The perfumed bodhisattvas step up. They look ashamed. "Boss," they say, "when we first got here, we thought this planet was a dump. We judged it. But now we see—your hustle is inconceivable. You make it rough because the people are rough. You meet 'em where they’re at. We apologize."

The Buddha says, "It’s all good. But before you go back, let me teach you the move called **The Exhaustible and The Inexhaustible**."

They lean in. "Lay it on us."

The Buddha says:
"**Exhaustible** is the World (*Samsara*). It wears you out. It changes. It burns up.
"**Inexhaustible** is the Truth (*Nirvana*). It don't change. It don't burn.

"But a Bodhisattva? A real Bluesman? He works the corner between the two.
"He don't quit the World, but he don't settle down in the Truth."

### Don't Quit the World (Keep the Meter Running)

"How do you stay in the game without getting played?
*   You love people without getting tired.
*   You save people without getting bored.
*   You hold the law without worrying about your own skin.
*   You work hard like it’s your first day on the job.
*   You look for the Truth like a hungry man looks for bread.
*   You jump into the fire of birth-and-death, and you don't even flinch.
*   You treat praise and insults the same—just noise in the street.
*   You don't hate the fool; you respect the wise.
*   You don't want to be alone on a mountaintop; you want to be right here, in the mess, where the people are.
*   You treat meditation like it’s prison—get in, get the goods, get out.
*   You treat this crazy world like it’s a beautiful park.
*   You treat beggars like they’re doing you a favor.
*   You treat your enemies like they’re your teachers.
*   You give everything away and feel richer for it.
*   You use wisdom like a switchblade to cut the ropes of fear.
*   You remember every note you ever heard."

"That," says the Buddha, "is how you don't exhaust the Conditioned."

### Don't Settle in the Truth (Don't retire early)

"And how do you stay out of the trap of Peace?
*   You know everything is empty, but you don't check out.
*   You know nothing is real, but you keep doing the work.
*   You know there’s no 'Self', but you keep teaching people like they matter.
*   You see the exit door (*Nirvana*), but you don't walk through it.
*   You see the heat is gone, but you keep your fire burning.
*   You treat the medicine, but you don't get high on the supply.
*   You encompass the Silence, but you keep on singing."

"This is the trick, my friends. Because you got Love, you don't float away into the Void. Because you got Wisdom, you don't get stuck in the mud.
"You hold the medicine in one hand and the sickness in the other.
"**You don't exhaust the World. You don't dwell in the Void.**
"That’s the Groove. That’s the Freedom of the Exhaustible and Inexhaustible."

## 4. Curtain Call

The perfumed bodhisattvas went wild. They threw flowers everywhere—colors and scents exploding all over the galaxy. They bowed to the Master and said, "Śāriputra was right. The Boss knows how to play a bad hand perfectly."

And just like that—*poof*—they were gone. Back to the Fragrant Land.

But the smell? The smell lingered.

## Blues Commentary: The Crossroads

This chapter is the ultimate answer to the question: "If everything sucks, why stick around?"

Usually, religion tells you to get out. Go to heaven. Go to Nirvana. Get off the wheel.
The Buddha here says: **No.**
If you get off the wheel, who’s gonna drive the bus?

The teaching of "Exhaustible and Inexhaustible" is the definition of the Bodhisattva style.
**Exhaustible** is the hustle. Paying rent, fixing tires, dealing with heartbreaks. It wears you down.
**Inexhaustible** is the peace. The silence. The cold zero of knowing it’s all barely real.

Most folks pick one. The hustler burns out. The monk checks out.
The Bodhisattva stands at the Crossroads. He keeps his hands in the dirt (Exhaustible) but his head in the sky (Inexhaustible).
He treats "Meditation like hell" (because it isolates you) and "Samsara like a park" (because it’s where you meet your friends).

That line about the rice digesting? That’s deep.
The truth ain't just an idea you swallow. It’s a slow-release capsule. It stays in your gut, working on you, eating up your ego from the inside out, until there’s nothing left but the perfume of kindness.

### Song: The Long Game (Don't Check Out)

(Slow, driving bass line. A Hammond B3 organ hums underneath.)

**(Verse 1)**
I see the exit sign flashin' neon red
It says "Peace and Quiet for the Dead"
It says "Drop your burden, lay it down"
"Get your ticket out of this dirty town"
I could fade to black, I could drift away
Into the cool blue silence of the Perfect Day

**(Chorus)**
But I ain't checkin' out, baby
No, I ain't checkin' out
I got a pocket full of trouble and a heart full of doubt
But as long as you're cryin', I’m stickin' about
I see the Open Door, but I’m stayin' outside
I’m ridin' this bus ‘til the end of the ride
Yeah, I play the long game.

**(Verse 2)**
They say this world is a burning house
Better run like a scared little mouse
But I see the flowers growin' in the cracks
I see the beauty that the good book lacks
I treat the sorrow like a garden gate
I treat the hustle like a twist of fate
You can have your cloud, you can have your bliss
I wouldn't trade your heaven for a lover’s kiss

**(Chorus)**
So I ain't checkin' out, baby
No, I ain't checkin' out
I got a pocket full of trouble and a heart full of doubt
But as long as there’s a song, I’m singin' it out
I see the Void callin', but I let it ring
I’d rather feel the sting than feel nothin'
Yeah, I play the long game.

**(Bridge)**
Exhaustible days, Inexhaustible nights
I’m walkin' the wire between the dark and the light
I take the poison, I turn it to wine
I take your heavy load, and I make it mine

**(Outro)**
Yeah, the rice is cookin' in my soul
Gonna take a long time to make me whole
Seven days, seven lives, seven million years
I’m stayin' right here to dry your tears.
I ain't goin' nowhere.
(Fade out on the organ)
