## The Setting and the Assembly

**Source Text**:
如是我聞：一時，佛在毘耶離菴羅樹園...

**Translation**:
Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was in the city of Vaiśālī, in the Āmrapālī grove, staying with a great assembly of eight thousand bhikṣus and thirty-two thousand Bodhisattvas. 

These Bodhisattvas were well-known to the multitude; they had accomplished the fundamental practices of great wisdom and were established by the majestic spiritual power of the Buddhas. As guardians of the Dharma-city, they upheld the True Dharma. Their lion's roar resounded in the ten directions. Without being requested, they were friends who brought peace to others (*ana-arthita-kalyāṇamitra*). They promoted the prosperity of the Triple Gem, ensuring it would never be severed.

**Philological Commentary**:
*   **Vaiśālī**: A major commercial and political center in ancient India, home of the Licchavi republic.
*   **Āmrapālī Garden**: Donated by the famous courtesan Amrapali. In the Vimalakirti Sutra, this setting emphasizes the crossover between lay and monastic life.
*   **Uninvited Friends**: A key Mahayana concept. A Bodhisattva does not wait for a plea for help; compassion is proactive and spontaneous.

## Ratnakara's Verse of Praise

**Source Text**:
目淨脩廣如青蓮，心淨已度諸禪定...

**Translation**:
"Your eyes are pure, long and broad like the blue lotus;
Your mind is pure, having transcended all meditative states.
For long you have accumulated pure deeds, your fame is immeasurable;
You lead the multitude with tranquility—therefore I bow my head."

**Philological Commentary**:
*   **Blue Lotus** (*utpala*): A standard metaphor for the Buddha's eyes—serene, clear, and beautiful.
*   **Neither Existent nor Non-existent** (說法不有亦不無): Here, Kumārajīva's translation anticipates the Madhyamaka dialectic. The Buddha's teaching avoids the two extremes (*antau*).
*   **Empty, Signless, and Aimless**: The verse emphasizes the three doors of liberation (*vimokṣa-mukha*).

## The Purity of the Buddha Land

**Source Text**:
佛言：「寶積！眾生之類是菩薩佛土...」

**Translation**:
The Buddha said: "Ratnakara! The category of living beings is itself the Buddha-land of the Bodhisattva. Why is this? A Bodhisattva takes a Buddha-land according to the living beings he converts... for the purpose of benefiting living beings. 

Suppose a man wished to build a palace on a plot of open land; he could do so without obstacle. But if he tried to build it in empty space, he could never succeed. Likewise, a Bodhisattva, in order to bring living beings to completion, seeks to take a Buddha-land. Seeking to take a Buddha-land is not [building] in empty space."

"Ratnakara, you should know: 
1.  A **straightforward mind** (*ṛju-citta*) is the Bodhisattva's pure land; when he attains Buddhahood, beings who are not hypocritical will be born in his kingdom.
2.  A **profound mind** (*adhyāśaya*) is the Bodhisattva's pure land; when he attains Buddhahood, beings who are endowed with merit will be born there.
3.  **Bodhicitta** is the Bodhisattva's pure land; when he attains Buddhahood, beings of the Great Vehicle will be born there."

[The list continues through the Perfections, the Four Immeasurables, and the Thirty-seven Factors of Enlightenment...]

**Philological Commentary**:
*   **Beings as the Land**: This is a revolutionary shift in Mahayana thought. The "Pure Land" is not a reward for the Buddha, but a field of transformation for beings.
*   **Building in Space**: The metaphor emphasizes that spiritual practice must be grounded in the reality of human suffering and interaction. You cannot be a Bodhisattva in a vacuum.
*   **Straightforward Mind**: *Ṛju-citta* implies honesty, sincerity, and the absence of guile—the prerequisite for all further progress.
