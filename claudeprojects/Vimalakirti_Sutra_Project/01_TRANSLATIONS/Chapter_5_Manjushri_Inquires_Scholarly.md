# Chapter 5: Manjushri Inquires About the Illness (文殊師利問疾品)

**Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel**

## The Buddha's Command

At that time, the Buddha addressed Mañjuśrī:¹ "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

Mañjuśrī said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! That superior person is difficult to respond to in debate.² He has deeply penetrated to the true aspect of reality,³ is skilled in expounding the essentials of the Dharma, and his eloquence flows without obstruction. His wisdom knows no impediment. He is thoroughly acquainted with all the methods of the bodhisattvas⁴ and has entered into the secret treasures of all buddhas. He has subdued the hosts of Māra and sports freely with spiritual powers.⁵ His wisdom and skillful means have both reached perfection. Nevertheless, I shall accept the Buddha's sagely command and go to inquire about his illness."

## The Great Assembly

Thereupon, the bodhisattvas, great disciples, Śakra, Brahmā, and the Four Heavenly Kings⁶ in the assembly all thought: "Now these two great beings—Mañjuśrī and Vimalakirti—will converse together.⁷ They will certainly expound the wondrous Dharma!" 

Immediately, eight thousand bodhisattvas, five hundred śrāvakas, and hundreds of thousands of devas and humans all wished to follow along.

Thus, Mañjuśrī, together with the bodhisattvas, great disciples, and the devas and humans, respectfully surrounded him as they entered the great city of Vaiśālī.

## Vimalakirti's Empty Room

At that time, the elder Vimalakirti thought to himself: "Now Mañjuśrī is coming with the great assembly!" Immediately, through his spiritual powers, he made his room empty,⁸ removing all furnishings and attendants. He placed only a single bed and lay upon it, feigning illness.

When Mañjuśrī entered his dwelling, he saw the room was empty, with nothing at all in it, and Vimalakirti lay alone on a single bed. At that time, Vimalakirti said: "Welcome, Mañjuśrī! You come with the mark of not-coming;⁹ you appear with the mark of not-appearing."

Mañjuśrī said: "Just so, householder! If one has already come, one does not come again; if one has already gone, one does not go again. Why is this? One who comes has nowhere from which they come; one who goes has no place to which they go. That which can be seen cannot be seen again.¹⁰ But let us set aside this matter. Householder! Can this illness be endured? Has the treatment brought improvement rather than increase? The World-Honored One earnestly sends his infinite inquiries. Householder! From what cause does this illness arise? How long has it persisted? How may it be extinguished?"

---

## The Illness of the Bodhisattva

Vimalakirti said: "From ignorance arises craving, and thus my illness arises.¹¹ Because all sentient beings are ill, therefore I am ill. If the illness of all sentient beings were extinguished, then my illness would be extinguished. Why is this? The bodhisattva enters birth-and-death for the sake of sentient beings.¹² Where there is birth-and-death, there is illness. If sentient beings were freed from illness, then the bodhisattva would have no illness.

"It is like a wealthy householder who has only one child.¹³ When the child becomes ill, the parents also become ill. When the child recovers, the parents also recover. The bodhisattva is likewise: for all sentient beings, he loves them as his children. When sentient beings are ill, the bodhisattva is ill; when sentient beings recover, the bodhisattva also recovers.

"You asked, 'From what cause does this illness arise?' The illness of the bodhisattva arises from great compassion."¹⁴

## The Dialogue on Emptiness

Mañjuśrī said: "Householder! Why is this room empty of attendants?"

Vimalakirti said: "All buddha-lands are likewise empty."¹⁵

Again he asked: "By what is it empty?"

He answered: "It is empty by emptiness."¹⁶

Again he asked: "What use is emptiness?"

He answered: "It is empty because of non-discriminating emptiness."

Again he asked: "Can emptiness be discriminated?"

He answered: "Discrimination is also empty."

Again he asked: "Where should emptiness be sought?"

He answered: "It should be sought among the sixty-two views."¹⁷

Again he asked: "Where should the sixty-two views be sought?"

He answered: "They should be sought in the liberation of all buddhas."

Again he asked: "Where should the liberation of all buddhas be sought?"

He answered: "It should be sought in the mental activities of all sentient beings.¹⁸

"Furthermore, you asked, 'Why are there no attendants?' All māras and all non-Buddhists are my attendants.¹⁹ Why is this? The māras delight in birth-and-death, but the bodhisattva does not abandon birth-and-death. The non-Buddhists delight in various views, but the bodhisattva is not moved by various views."

---

## The Nature of the Illness

Mañjuśrī said: "Householder! What is the nature of your illness?"

Vimalakirti said: "My illness has no form and cannot be seen."²⁰

Again he asked: "Is this illness united with the body? Or with the mind?"

He answered: "It is not united with the body, because the characteristic of the body is separation.²¹ Nor is it united with the mind, because the mind is like an illusion."

Again he asked: "Of the four great elements—earth, water, fire, and wind—which element's illness is this?"

He answered: "This illness is not the earth element, yet it does not leave the earth element. Water, fire, and wind are likewise. Yet the illnesses of sentient beings arise from the four great elements.²² Because they have illness, therefore I have illness."

---

## Consoling the Sick Bodhisattva

At that time, Mañjuśrī asked Vimalakirti: "How should a bodhisattva console a bodhisattva who is ill?"

Vimalakirti said: "Speak of the body's impermanence, but do not speak of weariness with the body.²³ Speak of the body's suffering, but do not speak of delighting in nirvāṇa. Speak of the body's non-self, yet speak of guiding sentient beings. Speak of the body's emptiness and tranquility, but do not speak of ultimate extinction.²⁴

"Speak of repenting former transgressions, but do not speak of entering into the past. Through one's own illness, have compassion for the illness of others. One should recognize the suffering throughout countless past lives. One should be mindful of benefiting all sentient beings. Remember the merit previously cultivated. Be mindful of pure livelihood. Do not give rise to grief or distress, but constantly arouse vigor.²⁵

"One should become a king of physicians and heal all illnesses. Thus should a bodhisattva console a sick bodhisattva and cause them to rejoice."

---

## Subduing the Mind

Mañjuśrī said: "Householder! How should an ill bodhisattva subdue their mind?"

Vimalakirti said: "An ill bodhisattva should reflect thus:²⁶ 'This present illness of mine arises entirely from the inverted delusions and afflictions of past lives. There is no real dharma—who is it that receives illness? Why is this? The four great elements combine and are provisionally named a body.²⁷ The four great elements have no master; the body likewise has no self.

"'Furthermore, this illness arises entirely from attachment to self. Therefore, one should not generate attachment to self.' Having understood the root of illness, one should eliminate the notion of self and the notion of sentient beings.²⁸ One should give rise to the notion of dharmas, reflecting thus: 'This body is merely a combination of dharmas. When it arises, only dharmas arise; when it ceases, only dharmas cease. These dharmas do not know one another. When arising, they do not say "I arise"; when ceasing, they do not say "I cease."'

"To eliminate the notion of dharmas, that ill bodhisattva should reflect thus: 'This notion of dharmas is also inverted. Inversion is a great affliction; I should separate from it.'²⁹ What is meant by separation? Separation from self and what belongs to self. What is meant by separation from self and what belongs to self? Separation from the two dharmas.³⁰ What is meant by separation from the two dharmas? Not thinking of internal and external dharmas, but practicing equality. What is meant by equality? Equality of self and equality of nirvāṇa.³¹ Why is this? Self and nirvāṇa—both are empty. By what are they empty? They are empty only as names.³²

"Thus these two dharmas have no fixed nature. Attaining this equality, there is no other illness—only the illness of emptiness. The illness of emptiness is also empty. This ill bodhisattva, with nothing to receive, yet receives all receptions. Not yet having completed buddha-dharmas, one does not extinguish reception to take up realization.³³

## Wisdom and Skillful Means

"If the body has suffering, contemplate beings in the evil realms and arouse great compassion.³⁴ Having subdued myself, I should likewise subdue all sentient beings. Simply eliminate their illness, but do not eliminate the dharma.³⁵ To cut off the root of illness, teach and guide them. What is called the root of illness? Craving and attachment. From craving and attachment comes the root of illness. What is craved and attached to? The three realms.³⁶ How does one cut off craving and attachment? Through non-attainment.³⁷ If there is non-attainment, then there is no craving and attachment. What is meant by non-attainment? Separation from the two views—what are the two views? The internal view and the external view.³⁸ This is non-attainment.

"Mañjuśrī! This is how an ill bodhisattva subdues their mind, cutting off the suffering of old age, illness, and death. This indeed is the bodhisattva's awakening.³⁹ If it is not thus, whatever practice and cultivation one engages in will lack the benefit of wisdom. It is like vanquishing an enemy—only then can one be called courageous.⁴⁰ Likewise, one who completely eliminates old age, illness, and death—this is what is called a bodhisattva.

---

## Bondage and Liberation

"That ill bodhisattva should further reflect thus: 'This illness of mine is neither real nor existent; the illness of sentient beings is likewise neither real nor existent.'⁴¹ Contemplating thus, if toward sentient beings one arouses great compassion based on craving and views, one should immediately abandon it. Why is this? The bodhisattva eliminates the adventitious dust of afflictions and arouses great compassion.⁴² Compassion based on craving and views gives rise to weariness in birth-and-death. If one can separate from this, there is no weariness. In every place of rebirth, one is not covered by craving and views. Birth is without bondage; one can expound the Dharma for sentient beings and unfasten their bondage.

"As the Buddha has said: 'If one is bound oneself, to seek to unbind others—this is impossible. If one is unbound oneself, to unbind others—this is possible.'⁴³ Therefore, the bodhisattva should not arouse bondage.

"What is bondage? What is liberation? Attachment to the taste of meditation—this is the bodhisattva's bondage.⁴⁴ Arising through skillful means—this is the bodhisattva's liberation.

"Furthermore, skillful means without wisdom is bondage; wisdom with skillful means is liberation.⁴⁵ Wisdom without skillful means is bondage; skillful means with wisdom is liberation.

"What is skillful means without wisdom as bondage? The bodhisattva, with a mind of craving and views, adorns buddha-lands and brings sentient beings to maturity, while in the dharmas of emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness subduing oneself—this is called skillful means without wisdom as bondage.⁴⁶

"What is wisdom with skillful means as liberation? Not adorning buddha-lands and bringing sentient beings to maturity with a mind of craving and views, while in the dharmas of emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness subduing oneself without weariness—this is called wisdom with skillful means as liberation.

"What is wisdom without skillful means as bondage? The bodhisattva abides in desire, anger, wrong views, and other afflictions while planting roots of virtue—this is called wisdom without skillful means as bondage.⁴⁷

"What is skillful means with wisdom as liberation? Separating from desire, anger, wrong views, and other afflictions while planting roots of virtue, and dedicating them to *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*—this is called skillful means with wisdom as liberation.

"Mañjuśrī! That ill bodhisattva should contemplate dharmas in this way.

## The Bodhisattva's Practice

"Furthermore, contemplate the body as impermanent, suffering, empty, and non-self—this is called wisdom.⁴⁸ Although the body has illness, constantly abiding in birth-and-death, benefiting all beings without weariness—this is called skillful means.

"Furthermore, contemplate the body: the body does not leave illness, illness does not leave the body.⁴⁹ This illness, this body—neither new nor old—this is called wisdom. The body having illness yet not permanently extinguishing—this is called skillful means.

"Mañjuśrī! An ill bodhisattva should thus subdue their mind,⁵⁰ not abiding therein, yet also not abiding in the non-subdued mind. Why is this? To abide in the non-subdued mind is the dharma of foolish beings; to abide in the subdued mind is the dharma of śrāvakas.⁵¹ Therefore, the bodhisattva should not abide in the subdued or non-subdued mind. Separating from these two dharmas—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Being in birth-and-death without polluted practice;⁵² abiding in nirvāṇa without permanent extinction—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Neither the conduct of ordinary beings nor the conduct of sages—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Neither defiled conduct nor pure conduct—this is the bodhisattva's practice.⁵³ Although going beyond demonic conduct, yet manifesting the subduing of Māra's hosts—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Seeking all-knowledge without untimely seeking—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Although contemplating all dharmas as unborn, yet not entering into the fixed position—this is the bodhisattva's practice.⁵⁴ Although contemplating the twelve links of dependent origination, yet entering into wrong views—this is the bodhisattva's practice.⁵⁵ Although gathering all sentient beings, yet not being attached—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Although delighting in seclusion, yet not depending on the extinction of body and mind—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although practicing in the three realms, yet not damaging the dharma-nature—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although practicing emptiness, yet planting roots of virtue—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although practicing signlessness, yet liberating sentient beings—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although practicing wishlessness, yet manifesting the receiving of a body—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Although practicing non-arising, yet arising in all good practices—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although practicing the six perfections, yet universally knowing the minds and mental dharmas of sentient beings—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although practicing the six supernatural powers, yet not exhausting the outflows—this is the bodhisattva's practice.⁵⁶

"Although practicing the four immeasurable minds, yet not craving birth in the Brahmā realm—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although practicing meditation, liberation, and *samādhi*, yet not being born according to meditation—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Although practicing the four foundations of mindfulness, yet not ultimately separating from body, sensations, mind, and dharmas—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although practicing the four right efforts, yet not abandoning bodily and mental diligence—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although practicing the four bases of spiritual power, yet attaining mastery of supernatural powers—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although practicing the five faculties, yet distinguishing the keen and dull faculties of sentient beings—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although practicing the five powers, yet delighting in seeking the Buddha's ten powers—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Although practicing the seven factors of awakening, yet distinguishing the Buddha's wisdom—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although practicing the Noble Eightfold Path, yet delighting in practicing the immeasurable Buddha path—this is the bodhisattva's practice.⁵⁷ Although practicing cessation and contemplation as aids to the path, yet not ultimately falling into extinction—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Although practicing the non-arising and non-ceasing of all dharmas, yet adorning one's body with the major and minor marks—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although manifesting the deportment of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, yet not abandoning the Buddha-Dharma—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although following the ultimate pure characteristic of all dharmas, yet appearing in whatever body is appropriate—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Although contemplating all buddha-lands as eternally tranquil like empty space, yet manifesting various pure buddha-lands—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although attaining the Buddha path, turning the Dharma wheel, and entering nirvāṇa, yet not abandoning the bodhisattva's path—this is the bodhisattva's practice."⁵⁸
