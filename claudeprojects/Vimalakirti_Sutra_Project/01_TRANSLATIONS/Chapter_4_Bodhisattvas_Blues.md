**Blues Translation by Master John Kim**

## The Buddha Keeps Trying

So then the Buddha told the Bodhisattva Maitreya:¹ "You go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

---

## Maitreya Ain't Going

Maitreya said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time in the past, I was teaching the Tuṣita Heaven king and his folks about the practices of the non-retrogression stage.² Vimalakirti came up and said to me:

"'Maitreya! The World-Honored One gave you the prediction that in one more lifetime you gonna attain supreme enlightenment.³ Which lifetime did you receive that prediction for? Is it the past lifetime? The future lifetime? Or the present lifetime?

"'If it's the past lifetime, the past lifetime already perished. If it's the future lifetime, the future lifetime ain't arrived yet. If it's the present lifetime, the present lifetime don't abide.⁴ As the Buddha said: "Monk! In this very moment you're also being born, also aging, and also dying."⁵

"'If you received the prediction based on non-arising,⁶ then non-arising is the ultimate position.⁷ In that ultimate position, there ain't no receiving prediction and no attaining supreme enlightenment. So how did Maitreya receive the one-lifetime prediction?

"'Did you receive the prediction from thusness arising or from thusness ceasing?⁸ If from thusness arising, thusness don't arise. If from thusness ceasing, thusness don't cease.

"'All sentient beings are thusness.⁹ All dharmas are also thusness. All holy sages are also thusness. And Maitreya is also thusness. If Maitreya receives a prediction, all sentient beings should also receive a prediction. Why? Thusness is non-dual and non-different.¹⁰ If Maitreya attains supreme enlightenment, all sentient beings should also attain it. Why? All sentient beings ARE the characteristic of bodhi.¹¹ If Maitreya attains nirvāṇa, all sentient beings should also attain nirvāṇa. Why? All buddhas know that all sentient beings are ultimately quiescent—that's the characteristic of nirvāṇa. There ain't no further extinction to undergo.¹²

"'Therefore, Maitreya! Don't seduce these deva-sons with this teaching. In reality, nobody generates the mind of supreme enlightenment, and nobody retrogresses from it. Maitreya! You should cause these deva-sons to abandon their discriminating views about bodhi. Why?

"'Bodhi can't be attained by body and can't be attained by mind.¹³ Quiescence is bodhi, 'cause all characteristics are extinguished. Non-viewing is bodhi, 'cause all conditions are abandoned. Non-action is bodhi, 'cause there's no recollection. Cutting off is bodhi, 'cause all views are relinquished. Separation is bodhi, 'cause all delusive thoughts are abandoned. Obstruction is bodhi, 'cause all aspirations are obstructed.¹⁴ Non-entry is bodhi, 'cause there's no attachment. Accordance is bodhi, 'cause it accords with thusness. Abiding is bodhi, 'cause it abides in dharma-nature. Reaching is bodhi, 'cause it reaches the true limit.¹⁵ Non-duality is bodhi, 'cause it's apart from mind and mental objects.¹⁶ Equality is bodhi, 'cause it equals empty space. Unconditioned is bodhi, 'cause it's without arising, abiding, or ceasing. Knowing is bodhi, 'cause it comprehends the mental activities of sentient beings. Non-meeting is bodhi, 'cause all sense-bases don't meet.¹⁷ Non-uniting is bodhi, 'cause it's apart from the residue of afflictions. No location is bodhi, 'cause it's without form or color. Provisional name is bodhi, 'cause names and words are empty.¹⁸ Like transformation is bodhi, 'cause there's no grasping or rejecting. Without confusion is bodhi, 'cause it's constantly self-quiescent. Excellent quiescence is bodhi, 'cause its nature is pure. Non-grasping is bodhi, 'cause it's apart from clinging. Without difference is bodhi, 'cause all dharmas are equal. Without comparison is bodhi, 'cause there's nothing it can be compared to. Subtle and wonderful is bodhi, 'cause all dharmas are hard to know.'¹⁹

"World-Honored One! When Vimalakirti taught this, two hundred deva-sons got the patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas.²⁰ That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

## Prabhāvyūha Ain't Going

The Buddha told the youth Prabhāvyūha:²¹ "You go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

Prabhāvyūha said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time in the past, as I was leaving the great city of Vaiśālī, Vimalakirti was just entering the city. I immediately bowed in greeting and asked:

"'Elder, where you coming from?'

"He answered: 'I'm coming from the bodhimaṇḍa.'²²

"I asked: 'What's the bodhimaṇḍa?'

"He answered: 'An upright mind is the bodhimaṇḍa,²³ 'cause it's free from falsehood. Generating practice is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it gets things done. A profound mind is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it increases merit. The bodhi-mind is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it's without error. Giving is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it don't seek reward. Upholding the precepts is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it fulfills vows. Patience is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause the mind is unobstructed toward all sentient beings. Vigor is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it don't slacken or retreat. Meditation is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause the mind is regulated and gentle. Wisdom is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it directly sees all dharmas. Loving-kindness is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it's equal toward all sentient beings. Compassion is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it endures weariness and suffering. Sympathetic joy is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it delights in the Dharma. Equanimity is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it cuts off aversion and affection. Supernatural powers are the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause they accomplish the six penetrations. Liberation is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it can turn its back on defilements.²⁴ Skillful means is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it teaches and transforms sentient beings. The four means of attraction are the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause they embrace sentient beings. Extensive learning is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause you practice what you've heard. Controlling the mind is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it correctly contemplates all dharmas.²⁵ The thirty-seven factors of enlightenment are the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause they abandon conditioned dharmas. The truths²⁶ are the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause they don't deceive the world. Dependent origination is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause ignorance up to old age and death are all without exhaustion.²⁷ The afflictions are the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause they're known as they truly are. Sentient beings are the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause they're known to be without self. All dharmas are the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause all dharmas are known to be empty. Conquering Māra is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it ain't overturned. The three realms are the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause there's no destination. The lion's roar is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it's fearless. The powers, fearlessnesses, and unique qualities are the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause they're without faults. The three insights are the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause they're without remaining obstructions. In one thought-moment knowing all dharmas is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it accomplishes omniscience.²⁸

"'So, good son! If a bodhisattva teaches and transforms sentient beings in accordance with the pāramitās, whatever he does—raising his foot or lowering his foot—you should know it all comes from the bodhimaṇḍa and abides in the Buddha-Dharma.'²⁹

"When he taught this, five hundred deva-sons and humans all generated the mind of supreme enlightenment. That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

## Jagatīṃdhara Ain't Going

The Buddha told the Bodhisattva Jagatīṃdhara:³⁰ "You go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

Jagatīṃdhara said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time in the past, I was staying in my quiet room. Māra,³¹ the evil one, came with twelve thousand celestial maidens, looking like Śakra, with drums and strings and songs. He and his folks bowed at my feet, joined their palms, and stood to one side.

"I, thinking he was Śakra,³² said to him: 'Welcome, Kauśika! You deserve such merit, but you shouldn't be self-indulgent. Contemplate the impermanence of the five desires and seek the wholesome root; regarding body, life, and wealth, you should cultivate the solid Dharma.'

"He said to me: 'Righteous one! Accept these twelve thousand celestial maidens to be your attendants.'

"I said: 'Kauśika! Don't offer such non-Dharmic things to a son of the Śākya's śramaṇa.³³ This ain't appropriate for me.'

"Before I finished speaking, Vimalakirti came up and said to me: 'This ain't Śakra—this is Māra, come to disturb you!'

"He immediately addressed Māra: 'These women can be given to me—I'm one who should accept them.'

"Māra was alarmed, thinking: 'Will Vimalakirti harm me?' He tried to hide and leave, but couldn't. Using all his supernatural powers, he still couldn't leave. Then he heard a voice from the sky: 'Pāpīyas! Give the women to him, and only then can you leave.'

"Māra, out of fear, reluctantly gave them.

"Vimalakirti told the women: 'Māra gave you to me. Now you should all generate the mind of supreme enlightenment.'³⁴

"He taught them according to their capacities, causing them to aspire to the Way. Then he said: 'You've already generated the aspiration for the Way. You got Dharma-joy to enjoy yourselves—you shouldn't take pleasure in the five desires anymore.'³⁵

"The maidens asked: 'What's Dharma-joy?'

"He answered: 'Joy is constantly having faith in the Buddha. Joy is wanting to hear the Dharma. Joy is making offerings to the assembly. Joy is being apart from the five desires. Joy is viewing the five aggregates as enemies. Joy is viewing the four elements as venomous snakes. Joy is viewing the sense-bases as empty villages.³⁶ Joy is following and protecting the aspiration for the Way. Joy is benefiting sentient beings. Joy is honoring and serving the teacher. Joy is giving extensively. Joy is firmly upholding the precepts. Joy is patience and gentleness. Joy is diligently gathering the roots of goodness. Joy is meditation without confusion. Joy is wisdom apart from defilements. Joy is widely generating the bodhi-mind. Joy is conquering the māras. Joy is cutting off the afflictions. Joy is purifying the buddha-lands. Joy is accomplishing the marks and characteristics, thereby cultivating all merits. Joy is adorning the bodhimaṇḍa. Joy is hearing the profound Dharma without fear. Joy is the three gates of liberation³⁷ without delighting in inopportune times. Joy is being close to those who study the same Dharma. Joy is having no resentment toward those who don't study the same Dharma.³⁸ Joy is supporting even evil friends. Joy is drawing close to good friends.³⁹ Joy is joyful purity of mind. Joy is cultivating immeasurable practice-methods of the Way. That's the Dharma-joy of bodhisattvas.'

"Then Māra told the women: 'I wanna return with you to the heavenly palace.'

"The women said: 'Since you gave us to this elder, we got Dharma-joy and are very joyful. We don't take pleasure in the five desires anymore.'

"Māra said: 'Elder, can you release these women? To give away all one has—that's the bodhisattva.'

"Vimalakirti said: 'I already released them! You can take them. Let all sentient beings' Dharma-aspirations be fulfilled.'⁴⁰

"Then the women asked Vimalakirti: 'How should we abide in Māra's palace?'

"Vimalakirti said: 'Sisters! There's a Dharma-gate called the Inexhaustible Lamp.⁴¹ You should learn it. The Inexhaustible Lamp is like a single lamp lighting a hundred thousand lamps—the dark all become bright, and the brightness never runs out.

"'So, sisters! A single bodhisattva guides and opens up a hundred thousand sentient beings, causing them to generate the mind of supreme enlightenment—their aspiration for the Way never runs out either. According to what they teach, they increase all wholesome dharmas in themselves. That's the Inexhaustible Lamp.

"'Even though you live in Māra's palace, with this Inexhaustible Lamp, cause innumerable deva-sons and deva-daughters to generate the mind of supreme enlightenment. This will repay the Buddha's kindness and greatly benefit all sentient beings.'

"The maidens bowed at Vimalakirti's feet and followed Māra back to the palace, suddenly disappearing.

"World-Honored One! Vimalakirti got such autonomous supernatural power and wise eloquent speech. That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

---

## Sudhana Ain't Going

The Buddha told the elder's son Sudhana:⁴² "You go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

Sudhana said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time in the past, at my father's house I held a great donation ceremony,⁴³ making offerings to all śramaṇas and brahmins, various non-Buddhist teachers, the poor, the lowly, orphans and solitaries, and beggars. After the full seven days, Vimalakirti came in and said to me:

"'Son of an elder! A great donation ceremony shouldn't be held like you're holding it. You should hold a Dharma-giving ceremony.⁴⁴ What's the use of a wealth-giving ceremony?'

"I said: 'Elder! What's a Dharma-giving ceremony?'

"He answered: 'A Dharma-giving ceremony is one where, without before or after, you simultaneously make offerings to all sentient beings.⁴⁵ That's a Dharma-giving ceremony.'

"I said: 'What does that mean?'

"'It means: Using bodhi to arouse the mind of loving-kindness.⁴⁶ Using saving sentient beings to arouse great compassion. Using upholding the true Dharma to arouse sympathetic joy. Using gathering wisdom to practice equanimity. Using gathering up stinginess and greed to arouse the pāramitā of giving. Using transforming those who violate precepts to arouse the pāramitā of morality. Using the teaching of non-self to arouse the pāramitā of patience. Using departing from the characteristics of body and mind to arouse the pāramitā of vigor. Using the characteristic of bodhi to arouse the pāramitā of meditation. Using omniscience to arouse the pāramitā of wisdom.

"'Teaching and transforming sentient beings, yet arising emptiness. Not abandoning conditioned dharmas, yet arising signlessness. Manifesting being born, yet arising wishlessness. Protecting and upholding the true Dharma, arising the power of skillful means. Using liberating sentient beings to arise the four means of attraction. Using honoring all beings to arise the elimination of pride. Regarding body, life, and wealth, arising the three solid dharmas.⁴⁷ In the six recollections, arising the method of thought.⁴⁸ In the six harmonies and reverence, arising straightforward mind.⁴⁹ Correctly practicing wholesome dharmas, arising pure livelihood. With pure and joyful mind, arising closeness to noble sages. Without hating evil people, arising a regulated mind. With the dharma of leaving home, arising profound mind. With practicing as you say, arising extensive learning. With the teaching of non-contention, arising solitude. Tending toward Buddha's wisdom, arising seated meditation. Liberating the bonds of sentient beings, arising stages of practice. With accomplishing the marks and purifying buddha-lands, arising meritorious karma. Knowing all sentient beings' thoughts and teaching accordingly, arising knowledge-karma. Knowing all dharmas without grasping or rejecting and entering the single-characteristic gate, arising wisdom-karma.⁵⁰ Cutting off all afflictions, obstacles, and unwholesome dharmas, arising all wholesome karma. Attaining all wisdom and all wholesome dharmas, arising all practices that assist the Buddha-Way.

"'So, good son! That's a Dharma-giving ceremony. If a bodhisattva abides in this Dharma-giving ceremony, he's a great donor and also a field of merit for all the world.'⁵¹

"World-Honored One! When Vimalakirti taught this, among the brahmins two hundred people all generated the mind of supreme enlightenment. At that time, my mind attained purity. I sighed at what I'd never experienced! I bowed at Vimalakirti's feet and immediately removed my necklace worth a hundred thousand to offer him, but he refused it.

"I said: 'Elder! Please accept it and give it as you wish.'

"Vimalakirti then accepted the necklace and divided it into two parts. He gave one part to the lowest beggar in the assembly and offered one part to the Tathāgata Duṣprasaha.⁵² Everybody saw the Radiant Land of that buddha, and they also saw the pearl necklace on that buddha transforming into a four-pillared jeweled platform, magnificently adorned on all four sides.

"Vimalakirti then said: 'If a donor gives with an equal mind to the lowest beggar, this is the same as the field of merit of the Tathāgata—without any discrimination, equal in great compassion, not seeking any reward. That's called complete Dharma-giving.'⁵³

"When the lowest beggar in the city saw this spiritual power and heard his words, they all generated the mind of supreme enlightenment. That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

## Concluding the Blues

So all the bodhisattvas each explained to the Buddha the account of their own past encounter, describing what Vimalakirti said. Every one of them declared they couldn't go ask about his illness.

## Endnotes

¹ **Maitreya**: The future buddha, currently a bodhisattva waiting in Tuṣita Heaven. He's next in line.

² **Non-retrogression stage**: The stage from which a bodhisattva can't fall back. Vimalakirti challenges even this.

³ **One-lifetime prediction**: The prophecy that in Maitreya's next life he'll become a buddha. His defining characteristic.

⁴ **Present don't abide**: The present moment is too fleeting—it's already gone before it can be grasped. The Blues knows about this—try to hold onto joy and it slips through your fingers.

⁵ **In this moment being born, aging, dying**: Everything happens at once. Birth, aging, death—they all occur in each instant.

⁶ **Non-arising**: The realization that phenomena don't truly arise.

⁷ **Ultimate position**: The state beyond arising and ceasing. But if you're there, where's prediction?

⁸ **Thusness arising/ceasing**: Thusness neither arises nor ceases—so prediction can't be based on it.

⁹ **All sentient beings are thusness**: Since everything is thusness, and thusness is non-dual, if Maitreya's predicted, all are predicted.

¹⁰ **Non-dual and non-different**: The heart of the Vimalakirti Sutra's teaching.

¹¹ **KEY DOCTRINE: All sentient beings ARE the characteristic of bodhi**: Enlightenment ain't something added to beings—it's their very nature. We already got it. We just don't see it.

¹² **No further extinction to undergo**: We're already in nirvāṇa in our ultimate nature. There's no second extinction.

¹³ **Can't be attained by body or mind**: Bodhi transcends body and mind.

¹⁴ **Obstruction is bodhi**: Paradox—bodhi obstructs all goals because there's nothing to achieve.

¹⁵ **True limit**: The absolute boundary of reality.

¹⁶ **Apart from mind and mental objects**: Beyond subject-object duality.

¹⁷ **Sense-bases don't meet**: The ordinary model of knowing (sense meeting object) is deconstructed.

¹⁸ **Provisional name**: "Bodhi" is just a word—names got no inherent reality.

¹⁹ **All dharmas are hard to know**: The conclusion emphasizes the ineffability of awakening.

²⁰ **Patient acceptance of non-arising**: A very high attainment.

²¹ **Prabhāvyūha**: "Splendid Light Youth." A bodhisattva.

²² **Bodhimaṇḍa**: Literally "place of enlightenment"—the spot where a buddha wakes up. Vimalakirti radically redefines it.

²³ **KEY TEACHING: Everything is the bodhimaṇḍa**: This massive list transforms the bodhimaṇḍa from a physical location to the entire field of spiritual practice. Wherever you are, that's the awakening place.

²⁴ **Can turn its back on defilements**: Liberation enables you to turn away from what binds you.

²⁵ **Controlling the mind**: The foundational practice.

²⁶ **The truths**: The Four Noble Truths.

²⁷ **Without exhaustion**: Even the twelve links of dependent origination are understood non-dually.

²⁸ **Omniscience**: Knowing that encompasses all dharmas in a single moment.

²⁹ **REVOLUTIONARY TEACHING: Every action comes from the bodhimaṇḍa**: The awakening place ain't somewhere else—it's here, in every step. Raising your foot, lowering your foot—that's it.

³⁰ **Jagatīṃdhara**: "Upholder of the World." A bodhisattva.

³¹ **Māra**: The evil one, the tempter.

³² **Śakra/Kauśika**: Indra, king of the gods.

³³ **Śākya's śramaṇa**: A Buddhist monk.

³⁴ **Vimalakirti teaches Māra's women**: Radical inclusivity—even the devil's entourage can wake up.

³⁵ **Dharma-joy vs. five desires**: Spiritual happiness replaces sensual pleasure.

³⁶ **Five aggregates as enemies, four elements as snakes, sense-bases as empty villages**: Classic analogies for disenchantment with body and world.

³⁷ **Three gates of liberation**: Emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness.

³⁸ **No resentment toward those who don't study**: Non-sectarianism.

³⁹ **Supporting evil friends, drawing close to good friends**: You support all beings while being influenced by the good.

⁴⁰ **Let all beings' Dharma-aspirations be fulfilled**: Vimalakirti's giving is this ultimate wish.

⁴¹ **KEY TEACHING: The Inexhaustible Lamp**: One lamp lighting countless others—one teacher awakening countless beings. Liberation ain't diminished by sharing—it increases. Each awakened being ignites others. The Blues knows about this—one song can light up a thousand souls.

⁴² **Sudhana**: "Good Virtue." A layman.

⁴³ **Great donation ceremony**: A traditional lavish giving ceremony.

⁴⁴ **Dharma-giving**: Superior to material giving—you give the means for liberation.

⁴⁵ **Without before or after, simultaneously**: Non-dual giving transcends time.

⁴⁶ **Using bodhi to arouse loving-kindness**: Every practice is grounded in awakening.

⁴⁷ **Three solid dharmas**: Giving body, life, and wealth.

⁴⁸ **Six recollections**: Recollection of Buddha, Dharma, Saṅgha, giving, morality, and devas.

⁴⁹ **Six harmonies and reverence**: Harmony in body, speech, mind, morality, views, and property.

⁵⁰ **Single-characteristic gate**: The gate of non-duality.

⁵¹ **Field of merit for all the world**: The bodhisattva who practices Dharma-giving is the supreme recipient of offerings.

⁵² **Tathāgata Duṣprasaha**: "The Hard-to-Surpass Tathāgata." A buddha of another world.

⁵³ **KEY TEACHING: Equal giving to the lowest beggar equals giving to a buddha**: This democratizes merit. No hierarchy in generosity. The beggar and the buddha are the same field of merit when your mind is equal.

## Theological Notes

### Maitreya's Prediction Deconstructed

Even the future buddha's prediction is empty. There's no moment when it happened—past is gone, future ain't here, present don't stay. If prediction is based on non-arising, then non-arising is beyond prediction. If Maitreya is thusness, and all beings are thusness, then all beings are equally predicted. The bodhisattva path includes transcending the bodhisattva path.

### The Bodhimaṇḍa Is Everywhere

Prabhāvyūha's encounter transforms where awakening happens. It ain't under a particular tree in India—it's in every quality of the path, in every moment, in every step. The Blues knows this—awakening ain't at the end of the road, it's the road itself.

### The Inexhaustible Lamp

This teaching to Māra's women is famous. One lamp lights countless lamps without diminishing. The light spreads without end. This is the bodhisattva vision—your awakening benefits all, and that benefit never runs out. The Blues spreads the same way—one song inspiring another, each performance unique but the spirit undiminished.

### Dharma-Giving vs. Wealth-Giving

Material generosity has its place, but it don't free anyone. Dharma-giving—sharing the truth—liberates. And the highest Dharma-giving sees no difference between the beggar and the buddha. Equal heart, equal gift.
