# Chapter 12: Seeing Akshobhya Buddha (The Man from Nowhere)

**Blues Vernacular Translation by Master John Kim**

## 1. How to Look at a Legend

The Boss turns to Vimalakirti. "So, V. You wanted to see me. You wanted to see the Tathāgata. Well, here I am. How do you look at me?"

Vimalakirti leans back. "Boss, I look at you the same way I look at my own face in a mirror—which is to say, I don't see nothin' there at all.
"I look for you in the past, you ain't there.
"I look for you in the future, you ain't there.
"I look for you right now, and you’re already gone.

"I don't look at your body. I don't look at your vibe. I don't look at your feelings.
"You didn't come from the earth, wind, or fire. You’re like the empty sky—you got room for everything but you stick to nothing.
"You ain't in this world, but you ain't out of it.
"You’re cool with the saints, but you’re just as cool with the fools.
"You ain't this, you ain't that. You ain't here, you ain't there.
"You got no shape, no name, no weight, no color.
"You don't give nothing, but you ain't stingy.
"You don't keep rules, but you don't break 'em neither.
"You ain't patient, 'cause you never get mad.
"You ain't smart, 'cause you ain't never been grand.
"You don't come. You don't go. You don't exit. You don't enter.

"Boss, you ain't a 'Holy Man'. But you ain't unholy neither.
"You ain't 'The One'. But you ain't 'Not The One'.
"You’re just... What Is.
"That’s how I see you. If folks see you as a golden statue or a superhero, they’re seeing a cartoon. If they see you like this—empty, open, and free—then they’re seeing the Real Deal."

## 2. Where You From, Son?

Śāriputra pipes up. "Hey Vimalakirti, that’s deep. But tell me something. Where did you die before you were born here? Where’s your hometown?"

Vimalakirti smiles. "Śāriputra, does the Truth ever die? Does the Music ever get born?"

"No," says Śāriputra. "The Music just Is."

"Right," says Vimalakirti. "So if nothing ever really dies or gets born, why you askin' to see my passport?
"It’s like a magician on stage. He pulls a rabbit out of a hat. Does the rabbit have a birthday? Does the rabbit have a funeral?"

"No, it’s just a trick."

"Exactly. Life is a trick, man. 'Death' is just the trick fading out. 'Birth' Is just the trick fading in. A real Bodhisattva fades out without losing his groove, and he fades in without picking up bad habits."

The Buddha steps in. "Śāriputra, let me tell you. There’s a land way out East called **Wonderful Joy**. The Boss there is named **Immovable** (Akshobhya). That’s where Vimalakirti came from. He punched his ticket there just so he could come slang the Truth here."

Śāriputra’s jaw drops. "You gotta be kidding me. You left *Wonderful Joy*? You left a Clean Land to comes to this dump? Why? We got nothing here but anger, bills, and bad weather."

Vimalakirti looks at him. "Śāriputra, think about the sun. When the sun comes out, does it catch the darkness?"

"No. When the sun shows up, the dark is gone."

"And why does the sun come to the dark places?"

"To light 'em up."

"Bingo," says Vimalakirti. "A Bodhisattva is like the sun. He don't hang out in the Clean Lands because the Clean Lands don't need him. He comes to the dirty places. But he don't get dirty. He just turns on the light and burns off the blues."

## 3. Bringing the House Down

The crowd starts buzzing. They all want to see this "Wonderful Joy" place. They want to see the Immovable One.

The Buddha knows what they’re thinking. He nods at Vimalakirti. "Go ahead, V. Show 'em where you come from."

Vimalakirti thinks to himself, "Alright, I ain't even gonna get out of my chair. I’m just gonna grab the whole planet."

He goes into a deep focus. He reaches out with his mind—way, way out East.
He grabs the whole setup—the Iron Mountains, the rivers, the oceans, the stars, the moon, the palaces, the people, the Bodhisattvas, the Immovable Buddha himself—he grabs it all.
He spins it off its axis like a DJ spinning a record.
He brings the whole world right here into the Garden.

**And check this out:**
He puts a whole planet on top of our planet, but nobody gets squished. The spaces act like ghosts passing through ghosts. Vimalakirti’s pad doesn't get smaller, and the new world doesn't get smaller. It’s perfect superposition.

The folks from Wonderful Joy start freaking out. "Hey! Who’s moving us? Where are we going?"
Buddha Akshobhya says, "Calm down. It’s Vimalakirti. He’s just showing you off."

The folks in our world look up and see the glory. Pure clear light. Bodhisattvas walking tall. No trash in the streets. No lying politicians. Just straight up Joy.

The Buddha says, "Take a good look, y'all. That’s what it looks like when you keep your nose clean. That’s the House of the Immovable. If you want to live there, you gotta learn to stand your ground like Akshobhya."

Fourteen million people right then and there decided, "That’s it. I’m cleaning up my act. I want a ticket to that place."

And then, just as fast as it came—*whoosh*.
Vimalakirti sends it back. The vision fades. But the memory? The memory stays burned in their minds forever.

## Blues Commentary: The Man from Nowhere

This chapter is the "Origin Story."
Usually, when you find out the hero is an alien (like Superman), it explains his powers.
Vimalakirti is an alien. He’s from **Abhirati** (Wonderful Joy).

But unlike Superman, who got sent away because his planet blew up, Vimalakirti **chose** to leave.
He left paradise to come to the ghetto.
Why? Because that’s where the work is.
"The sun doesn't shine on the light; it shines on the dark."

This explains Vimalakirti’s style. He’s cool. Nothing rattles him. Why? Because his boss is **Akshobhya**—The Immovable.
Akshobhya represents the mind that cannot be shaken by anger or lust.
If you dwell in "Wonderful Joy," you can walk through hell in a gasoline suit and never catch fire.

### Song: Moving the Mountain (I Ain't Moving)

(A heavy, stomping blues rhythm. Like a chain gang song.)

**(Verse 1)**
I come from a land where the river runs clear
No lying tongues, no trembling fear
My Daddy is a mountain that never slides
My Mama is the ocean with the steady tides
But I packed my bags and I walked away
To come down here where the shadows play

**(Chorus)**
I’m moving the mountain, but I ain't moving my feet
I’m bringing the heaven to the dirty street
You ask me why I left the Promised Land?
To put a little light in a shaking hand
Yeah, I’m the Immovable Man.

**(Verse 2)**
You ask where I died, you ask where I was born
I say I’m just a sound in a Gabriel horn
I ain't got a ticket, I ain't got a grave
I ain't got a soul that I need to save
I look at the Buddha and what do I see?
I see the empty space inside of me

**(Chorus)**
I’m moving the mountain, but I ain't moving my feet
I’m bringing the heaven to the dirty street
You ask if the sun is afraid of the night?
Man, the sun is the only thing that makes it right
Yeah, I’m the Immovable Man.

**(Bridge)**
I can spin the world like a potter’s wheel
I can show you exactly how the truth feels
I can bring the East to the West
I can put your weary heart to rest
But I can't walk the path for you, my friend
You gotta stand tall until the very end

**(Outro)**
Stand tall.
Be Immovable.
Don't let 'em shake you.
Don't let 'em break you.
Wonderful Joy... it’s right here.
(Stomp... Stomp... Fade out)
