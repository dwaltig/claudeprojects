# The Vimalakīrti Nirdeśa Sūtra (Scholarly Edition)

# Introduction

## About This Translation

The *Vimalakīrti Nirdeśa Sūtra* (Sutra of the Teaching of Vimalakirti) is a foundational text of Mahāyāna Buddhism, celebrated for its profound philosophy of non-duality (*advaya*) and its dramatic narrative centered on the enlightened lay householder Vimalakirti.

This scholarly edition presents a complete translation of the sutra from the classical Chinese version of Kumārajīva (T475), widely regarded as the standard in East Asian Buddhism.

## Methodology

The goal of this translation is rigorous accuracy and philosophical clarity. While respecting the poetic beauty of Kumārajīva's Chinese, the primary focus is on elucidating the doctrinal arguments that drive the text.

Key features of this edition include:
*   **Philological Precision**: Careful attention to technical terms, often reconstructing the underlying Sanskrit concepts (e.g., *śūnyatā*, *upāya*, *bodhicitta*) to clarify the Chinese rendering.
*   **Scholarly Apparatus**: Each chapter is accompanied by extensive footnotes and commentary that situate the text within the broader context of Indian and East Asian Buddhist thought.
*   **Philosophical Analysis**: Special emphasis is placed on the sutra's dialectical structure, particularly its treatment of "emptiness" not as nihilism but as the condition for compassionate engagement in the world.

## Significance of the Text

The Vimalakirti Sutra is unique in placing a layman at the center of the drama, superior in wisdom to the Buddha's monastic disciples. It challenges rigid distinctions between "sacred" and "secular," "monastic" and "lay," "pure" and "impure." Its central teaching—that the Bodhisattva path can be walked in the marketplace as fully as in the monastery—remains a vital message for the modern world.

We hope this volume serves as a reliable guide for scholars, students, and practitioners seeking to penetrate the profound silence of Vimalakirti.

## Opening Formula

Thus have I heard:¹

At one time, the Buddha was dwelling in the Āmrapālī Garden² near Vaiśālī,³ together with a great assembly of eight thousand bhikṣus⁴ and thirty-two thousand bodhisattvas⁵—all well-known, possessing great wisdom and fundamental practice, all having attained accomplishment. They had been established by the awesome spiritual power of all buddhas, served as protectors of the Dharma-citadel, and upheld the true Dharma. They could roar the lion's roar,⁶ their names renowned throughout the ten directions. Without being asked, they befriended and comforted beings. They continued and exalted the Three Jewels,⁷ enabling them never to be cut off. They had subdued Māra⁸ and his adversaries, controlled all heterodox teachers, and were completely pure, forever free from the hindrances and entanglements.⁹ Their minds constantly abided in unobstructed liberation.¹⁰ Their mindfulness, concentration, dhāraṇī,¹¹ and eloquence were uninterrupted. Giving, moral discipline, patience, vigor, meditation, wisdom, and skillful means¹²—all these powers they possessed completely. They had attained the patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas.¹³ They were already able to accord with and turn the irreversible wheel.¹⁴ They skillfully understood the characteristics of dharmas and knew the faculties of sentient beings. They covered the great assembly with fearlessness, merit, and wisdom, cultivating their minds thereby. The marks and secondary characteristics¹⁵ adorned their bodies, their physical appearance supreme. They had renounced all worldly adornments. Their fame and reputation were lofty and far-reaching, surpassing Mount Sumeru.¹⁶ Their deep faith was firm, like vajra.¹⁷ The Dharma-jewel universally illuminated, raining down sweet dew.¹⁸ Among all voices, theirs were the most subtle and wonderful. They had deeply entered dependent origination¹⁹ and severed all wrong views—the two extremes of existence and non-existence²⁰—without any residual habits. They expounded the Dharma fearlessly, like the lion's roar. Their discourses were like thunder. Measureless, they had transcended all measure. Gathering all Dharma-jewels, like ocean-navigating captains, they thoroughly understood the profound and subtle meaning of all dharmas. They well knew the comings and goings of sentient beings and what their minds were engaged in. They were close to the unequaled, equal Buddha's sovereign wisdom, the ten powers, the fearlessnesses, and the eighteen unique qualities.²¹ They closed the gates to all evil destinies, yet manifested their bodies in the five paths of existence.²² They were great physician-kings, skillfully healing all diseases, prescribing medicine according to illness, causing beings to take and practice it. Immeasurable merit they had accomplished; immeasurable buddha-lands they had purified. Those who saw or heard them all received benefit; whatever they did was never in vain. All such merits they possessed completely.

Their names were: Bodhisattva Equal Vision, Bodhisattva Unequal Vision, Bodhisattva Equal-Unequal Vision, Bodhisattva King of Concentration Sovereignty, Bodhisattva King of Dharma Sovereignty, Bodhisattva Dharma-Mark, Bodhisattva Light-Mark, Bodhisattva Light-Adornment, Bodhisattva Great Adornment, Bodhisattva Ratnākara,²³ Bodhisattva Eloquence-Accumulation, Bodhisattva Jewel-Hand, Bodhisattva Jewel-Seal-Hand, Bodhisattva Constantly-Raised-Hand, Bodhisattva Constantly-Lowered-Hand, Bodhisattva Constant Sorrow, Bodhisattva Joyful Root, Bodhisattva Joyful King, Bodhisattva Eloquent Voice, Bodhisattva Ākāśagarbha,²⁴ Bodhisattva Jewel-Torch-Bearer, Bodhisattva Jewel-Courage, Bodhisattva Jewel-Vision, Bodhisattva Indra's Net, Bodhisattva Bright Net, Bodhisattva Unconditioned Contemplation, Bodhisattva Wisdom-Accumulation, Bodhisattva Jewel-Victory, Bodhisattva Heavenly King, Bodhisattva Māra-Destroyer, Bodhisattva Lightning-Virtue, Bodhisattva Sovereign King, Bodhisattva Merit-Mark-Adornment, Bodhisattva Siṃhanāda,²⁵ Bodhisattva Thunder-Sound, Bodhisattva Mountain-Striking-Sound, Bodhisattva Fragrant Elephant, Bodhisattva White Fragrant Elephant, Bodhisattva Constant Vigor, Bodhisattva Never Resting, Bodhisattva Wonderful Birth, Bodhisattva Flower Adornment, Bodhisattva Avalokiteśvara,²⁶ Bodhisattva Mahāsthāmaprāpta,²⁷ Bodhisattva Brahmā's Net, Bodhisattva Jewel-Staff, Bodhisattva Invincible, Bodhisattva Land-Adorner, Bodhisattva Golden Topknot, Bodhisattva Pearl Topknot, Bodhisattva Maitreya,²⁸ and Bodhisattva Mañjuśrī,²⁹ Prince of the Dharma—thirty-two thousand such persons in all.

Furthermore, there were ten thousand Brahmā-kings, Śikhin³⁰ and others, who had come from other four-continent worlds to the Buddha's presence to hear the Dharma. There were also twelve thousand Śakras³¹ who likewise came from other four-continent worlds to sit in the assembly. Together with other great and mighty devas, nāgas, yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kiṃnaras, mahoragas,³² and so forth, all came to sit in the assembly. Bhikṣus, bhikṣuṇīs, upāsakas, and upāsikās³³ all came to sit in the assembly. At that time, the Buddha, surrounded respectfully by this immeasurable assembly of hundreds of thousands, expounded the Dharma for them. Like King Sumeru appearing in the great ocean, he sat peacefully upon a lion-throne adorned with all jewels, outshining all the assembled multitude.

## Ratnākara's Offering

At that time, in the city of Vaiśālī there was an elder's son named Ratnākara who, together with five hundred elder's sons, came to the Buddha's presence bearing jeweled canopies. They bowed their heads at his feet, and each offered their canopy in worship to the Buddha. Through the Buddha's awesome spiritual power, all the jeweled canopies merged into one canopy that covered the entire trichiliocosm.³⁴ The vast dimensions of this world-system were all visible within it. Moreover, within this trichiliocosm—all the Mount Sumerus, Snow Mountains, Mucilinda Mountains, Great Mucilinda Mountains, Fragrant Mountains, Jewel Mountains, Gold Mountains, Black Mountains, Iron-Ring Mountains, and Great Iron-Ring Mountains; the great oceans, rivers, streams, springs, and sources; the sun, moon, and stars; the palaces of the devas, nāgas, and various honored spirits—all appeared within the jeweled canopy. Furthermore, the buddhas of the ten directions and their exposition of Dharma also appeared within the jeweled canopy.

At that time, the entire great assembly beheld the Buddha's spiritual power and sighed at this unprecedented marvel. With palms joined, they bowed to the Buddha, gazing up at his honored countenance, their eyes not turning away for even a moment. Thereupon, the elder's son Ratnākara immediately spoke verses before the Buddha:

> "Eyes pure, long, and wide like blue lotuses,  
> Mind pure, having crossed all meditative states,  
> Long accumulating pure karma, called immeasurable,  
> Leading beings to quiescence—to you I bow.  
>   
> Having seen the Great Sage's spiritual transformations,  
> Universally manifesting immeasurable lands of the ten directions,  
> Wherein all buddhas expound the Dharma—  
> In this, all is seen and heard.  
>   
> The Dharma-King's Dharma-power transcends all beings,  
> Constantly bestowing Dharma-wealth upon all,  
> Skillfully distinguishing the characteristics of all dharmas,  
> Yet unmoved regarding ultimate truth—  
> Having attained sovereignty over all dharmas,  
> Therefore I bow to this Dharma-King.  
>   
> Expounding Dharma neither as existent nor non-existent,  
> Through causes and conditions all dharmas arise,  
> No self, no creator, no receiver,  
> Yet karma of good and evil is not lost.  
>   
> First at the Bodhi-tree, with power subduing Māra,  
> Attaining sweet dew's extinction, the enlightened Way accomplished,  
> Already without mind or thought, without grasping or action,  
> Yet completely crushing all heterodox teachers.  
>   
> Three turnings of the Dharma-wheel in the great trichiliocosm,  
> That wheel fundamentally and always pure,  
> Devas and humans attaining the Way—this is the proof,  
> The Three Jewels thus appearing in the world.  
>   
> With this sublime Dharma saving all beings,  
> Once received, never regressing, constantly quiescent,  
> Crossing old age, sickness, and death—Great Physician-King,  
> We should bow to the Dharma-ocean's boundless virtue.  
>   
> Unmoved by praise or blame, like Mount Sumeru,  
> Toward good and not-good, equal with compassion,  
> Mind practicing equality like empty space—  
> Who, hearing of this human jewel, would not respectfully receive?  
>   
> Now offering the World-Honored One this humble canopy,  
> Wherein appears my trichiliocosm,  
> The palaces where devas, nāgas, and spirits dwell,  
> Gandharvas and yakṣas too.  
>   
> All that exists in the world is seen,  
> The Ten Powers compassionately manifesting this transformation,  
> The multitude beholding the unprecedented, all praising the Buddha—  
> Now I bow to the Honored One of the Three Realms.  
>   
> The Great Sage Dharma-King, to whom all return,  
> With pure mind contemplating the Buddha, none not delighted,  
> Each seeing the World-Honored One before them—  
> This is spiritual power, an uncommon quality.  
>   
> The Buddha with one voice expounds the Dharma,  
> Sentient beings according to type each gaining understanding,  
> All considering the World-Honored One speaks their language—  
> This is spiritual power, an uncommon quality.  
>   
> The Buddha with one voice expounds the Dharma,  
> Sentient beings each according to their understanding,  
> All receiving, practicing, and obtaining benefit—  
> This is spiritual power, an uncommon quality.  
>   
> The Buddha with one voice expounds the Dharma,  
> Some fearful, some joyful,  
> Some generating renunciation, some severing doubt—  
> This is spiritual power, an uncommon quality.  
>   
> I bow to the Ten Powers' great vigor,  
> I bow to those who have attained fearlessness,  
> I bow to those abiding in uncommon qualities,  
> I bow to all great guides,  
> I bow to those able to sever all bondage,  
> I bow to those who have reached the other shore,  
> I bow to those able to ferry all worlds,  
> I bow to those forever free from the path of birth and death.  
>   
> Completely knowing sentient beings' comings and goings,  
> Skillful in all dharmas, attaining liberation,  
> Unattached to the world like a lotus flower,  
> Constantly and skillfully entering the practice of emptiness and quiescence,  
> Penetrating the characteristics of all dharmas without obstruction—  
> I bow to you, like space, without dependence."

## The Teaching on Pure Lands

At that time, after the elder's son Ratnākara had spoken these verses, he addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One, these five hundred elder's sons have all generated the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*.³⁵ They wish to hear how to attain a pure buddha-land. We only pray that the World-Honored One will explain the practices of bodhisattvas for purifying lands!"

The Buddha said: "Excellent, Ratnākara! That you are able to ask the Tathāgata on behalf of the bodhisattvas about the practices for purifying lands. Listen carefully, listen carefully! Think well upon this, and I shall explain it for you!" Thereupon Ratnākara and the five hundred elder's sons received the teaching and listened.

The Buddha said: "Ratnākara! The various classes of sentient beings are the bodhisattva's buddha-land.³⁶ Why is this so? A bodhisattva takes a buddha-land according to the sentient beings he transforms. A bodhisattva takes a buddha-land according to the sentient beings he tames. A bodhisattva takes a buddha-land according to what land sentient beings need to enter the Buddha's wisdom. A bodhisattva takes a buddha-land according to what land sentient beings need to arouse bodhisattva faculties. Why is this so? A bodhisattva's taking of a pure land is entirely for the sake of benefiting all sentient beings. It is like a person who wishes to construct a palace on empty ground—he may do so at will without obstruction. But if he tries to do so in empty space, he will never succeed! Bodhisattvas are like this: in order to accomplish sentient beings, they vow to take a buddha-land. Vowing to take a buddha-land is not [building] in emptiness.

"Ratnākara! You should know: An upright mind³⁷ is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings free from flattery will be born in his land. A profound mind³⁸ is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings replete with merit will be born in his land. The mind of bodhi³⁹ is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, Mahāyāna sentient beings will be born in his land. Giving is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings able to renounce all will be born in his land. Moral discipline is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings practicing the ten wholesome actions and fulfilling their vows will be born in his land. Patience is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings adorned with the thirty-two marks will be born in his land. Vigor is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings diligently cultivating all merits will be born in his land. Meditation is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings with collected and undistracted minds will be born in his land. Wisdom is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings in right concentration will be born in his land. The four immeasurables⁴⁰ are the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings accomplished in loving-kindness, compassion, joy, and equanimity will be born in his land. The four means of attraction⁴¹ are the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings embraced by liberation will be born in his land. Skillful means is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings unobstructed in skillful means regarding all dharmas will be born in his land. The thirty-seven factors of enlightenment⁴² are the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings [practicing] the foundations of mindfulness, right efforts, bases of spiritual power, faculties, powers, factors of enlightenment, and path-factors will be born in his land. The mind of dedication⁴³ is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, he will attain a land replete with all merits. Teaching the elimination of the eight difficulties⁴⁴ is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, his land will be free from the three evil paths and the eight difficulties. Guarding one's own moral conduct without criticizing others' faults is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, his land will have no name for violating prohibitions. The ten wholesome actions⁴⁵ are the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings whose lives are not cut short, who are greatly wealthy, who practice pure conduct, whose words are truthful, who constantly use gentle speech, whose relatives do not separate, who skillfully reconcile disputes, whose words necessarily benefit, who are not jealous, not angry, and hold right views will be born in his land.

"Thus, Ratnākara! According to a bodhisattva's upright mind, he is able to generate practice. According to his generating practice, he attains a profound mind. According to his profound mind, his intention becomes tamed. According to the taming of his intention, he practices as he speaks. According to practicing as he speaks, he is able to dedicate [merit]. According to his dedication, he has skillful means. According to his skillful means, he accomplishes sentient beings. According to accomplishing sentient beings, the buddha-land becomes pure. According to the purity of the buddha-land, the Dharma-teaching becomes pure. According to the purity of Dharma-teaching, wisdom becomes pure. According to the purity of wisdom, the mind becomes pure. According to the purity of mind, all merits become pure. Therefore, Ratnākara! If a bodhisattva wishes to attain a pure land, he should purify his mind. According to the purity of his mind, the buddha-land becomes pure."⁴⁶

## Śāriputra's Doubt and the Buddha's Response

At that time, Śāriputra,⁴⁷ empowered by the Buddha's awesome spiritual power, had this thought: "If when a bodhisattva's mind is pure, the buddha-land becomes pure, then when our World-Honored One was formerly practicing as a bodhisattva, was his intention not pure? Yet this buddha-land is impure like this!"

The Buddha, knowing his thought, immediately addressed him: "What do you think? Are the sun and moon not pure, yet the blind do not see them?"

He replied: "No, World-Honored One! This is the blind person's fault, not the fault of the sun and moon."

"Śāriputra! Because of sentient beings' transgressions, they do not see the Tathāgata's buddha-land's magnificent purity—it is not the Tathāgata's fault. Śāriputra! This land of mine is pure, yet you do not see it."

At that time, the Brahmā-king Jālinīprabha⁴⁸ addressed Śāriputra: "Do not have this thought, considering this buddha-land to be impure. Why is this so? I see Śākyamuni Buddha's land as pure, like the palace of the Paranirmita-vaśavartin heaven."⁴⁹

Śāriputra said: "I see this land full of hills, valleys, pits, thorns, sand, gravel, earth, stone mountains, and filth."

The Brahmā-king Jālinīprabha said: "Venerable one, your mind has highs and lows and does not rely on the Buddha's wisdom, therefore you see this land as impure! Śāriputra! Bodhisattvas are completely equal toward all sentient beings, their profound minds pure, relying on the Buddha's wisdom—then they are able to see this buddha-land as pure."

Thereupon the Buddha pressed the earth with his toe, and immediately the trichiliocosm was adorned with hundreds of thousands of jewels, like the Land of Immeasurable Merit and Jewel Adornment of the Buddha Ratnaketu.⁵⁰ The entire great assembly sighed at this unprecedented marvel, and all saw themselves sitting upon jeweled lotus flowers.

The Buddha told Śāriputra: "Do you now observe this buddha-land's magnificent purity?"

Śāriputra said: "Indeed so, World-Honored One! What I had never before seen or heard, the buddha-land's magnificent purity now all appears."

The Buddha addressed Śāriputra: "My buddha-land is constantly pure like this. In order to save inferior people, I manifest this land full of various evils and impurities! It is like when the devas eat from jeweled vessels—according to their merit, the color of the food differs. Likewise, Śāriputra! If a person's mind is pure, he then sees this land's meritorious adornment."

When the Buddha manifested this land's magnificent purity, the five hundred elder's sons led by Ratnākara all attained the patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas, and eighty-four thousand persons all generated the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. The Buddha withdrew his spiritual powers, and thereupon this world returned to its former state. Those seeking the Śrāvaka vehicle—thirty-two thousand devas and humans—knowing that conditioned dharmas are all impermanent, became far from dust and free from defilement, attaining the pure Dharma-eye.⁵¹ Eight thousand bhikṣus, not grasping any dharmas, exhausted the outflows and liberated their minds.⁵²

³⁵ **[Textual]** *Anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi* (阿耨多羅三藐三菩提). "Unsurpassed, complete, perfect enlightenment." The supreme awakening of a buddha.

³⁶ **[Philosophical]** **KEY DOCTRINE**: "Sentient beings are the bodhisattva's buddha-land" (眾生之類是菩薩佛土). This revolutionary teaching redefines pure lands not as external paradises but as the result of transforming sentient beings. The purity of the land depends on the purity of its inhabitants, which in turn depends on the bodhisattva's practice. This teaching bridges the apparent gap between the Mahāyāna emphasis on pure lands and the bodhisattva's commitment to working in impure realms. **[Cross-reference]** Compare with the Lotus Sutra's teaching that the Sahā world is actually Śākyamuni's eternal pure land, hidden from those with impure vision.

³⁷ **[Philosophical]** Upright mind (直心, *ṛju-citta*). Sincerity, honesty, straightforwardness. The foundation of all bodhisattva practice.

³⁸ **[Philosophical]** Profound mind (深心, *adhyāśaya*). Deep aspiration and commitment to the bodhisattva path.

³⁹ **[Philosophical]** Mind of bodhi (菩提心, *bodhicitta*). The aspiration to attain enlightenment for the sake of all beings. The essential motivation of the Mahāyāna path.

⁴⁰ **[Philosophical]** Four immeasurables (四無量心, *catvāri-apramāṇāni*). Loving-kindness (*maitrī*), compassion (*karuṇā*), sympathetic joy (*muditā*), and equanimity (*upekṣā*). Meditative practices that extend these attitudes boundlessly to all beings.

⁴¹ **[Philosophical]** Four means of attraction (四攝法, *catvāri-saṃgraha-vastūni*). Giving, kind speech, beneficial conduct, and cooperation. Methods bodhisattvas use to attract and guide beings to the Dharma.

⁴² **[Philosophical]** Thirty-seven factors of enlightenment (三十七道品, *saptatriṃśad-bodhipakṣika-dharmāḥ*). The complete set of practices leading to awakening: four foundations of mindfulness, four right efforts, four bases of spiritual power, five faculties, five powers, seven factors of enlightenment, and the noble eightfold path.

⁴³ **[Philosophical]** Mind of dedication (迴向心, *pariṇāmanā-citta*). The practice of dedicating all merit toward the enlightenment of all beings rather than one's own benefit.

⁴⁴ **[Textual]** Eight difficulties (八難, *aṣṭa-akṣaṇāni*). Eight conditions that make it difficult to encounter the Dharma: birth in hell, as a hungry ghost, as an animal, in a long-lived heaven, in a border region, with impaired faculties, with wrong views, or in a time without a buddha.

⁴⁵ **[Philosophical]** Ten wholesome actions (十善, *daśa-kuśala-karmāṇi*). Abstaining from killing, stealing, sexual misconduct, lying, divisive speech, harsh speech, idle chatter, covetousness, ill-will, and wrong views.

⁴⁶ **[Philosophical]** **CENTRAL TEACHING**: "According to the purity of mind, the buddha-land becomes pure" (隨其心淨，則佛土淨). This famous statement encapsulates the Vimalakirti Sutra's teaching on pure lands. It emphasizes that external purity is a reflection of internal purity—the environment is not separate from mind. This teaching has profound implications for Buddhist practice, suggesting that purifying one's mind is equivalent to purifying the world. **[Modern]** This resonates with contemporary understandings of how consciousness shapes perception and experience, though the Buddhist teaching goes further in asserting the mind's role in actually constituting reality.

⁴⁷ **[Textual]** Śāriputra (舍利弗, *Śāriputra*). "Son of Śārī." One of the Buddha's foremost disciples, renowned for his wisdom. In Mahāyāna sutras, he often represents the Śrāvaka perspective that must be transcended.

⁴⁸ **[Textual]** Jālinīprabha (螺髻梵王, *Jālinīprabha*). "Spiral-Topknot Brahmā-King." A Brahmā deity with matted hair coiled in a spiral, representing a higher level of spiritual vision than Śāriputra.

⁴⁹ **[Textual]** Paranirmita-vaśavartin heaven (自在天宮). The highest of the six desire-realm heavens, where deities have power over others' creations. Its splendor represents a high but still mundane level of purity.

⁵⁰ **[Textual]** Buddha Ratnaketu (寶莊嚴佛, *Ratnaketu*). "Jewel-Banner Buddha." A buddha whose pure land serves as the model for the temporary transformation of this world.

⁵¹ **[Philosophical]** Pure Dharma-eye (法眼淨, *dharma-cakṣus-viśuddhi*). The first stage of realization in the Śrāvaka path, seeing the truth of the Four Noble Truths and entering the stream to nirvāṇa.

⁵² **[Philosophical]** Exhausted the outflows and liberated their minds (漏盡意解, *āsrava-kṣaya*). Complete arhatship—freedom from all mental defilements and liberation from rebirth.

### Key Concepts

**Pure Land Soteriology**: This chapter presents a distinctive Mahāyāna teaching on pure lands that differs from the devotional Pure Land schools. Rather than emphasizing rebirth in Amitābha's Sukhāvatī through faith and recitation, the Vimalakirti Sutra teaches that pure lands arise from the bodhisattva's practice of purifying sentient beings. The land's purity is not separate from the purity of its inhabitants' minds.

**Non-Duality of Subject and Environment**: The teaching that "sentient beings are the bodhisattva's buddha-land" implies a non-dual relationship between consciousness and environment. This anticipates the sutra's central theme of non-duality, which will be fully developed in Chapter 9.

**Skillful Means and Relative Truth**: The Buddha's explanation that he manifests an impure land to save "inferior people" demonstrates the Mahāyāna teaching of skillful means. The same reality appears differently according to the observer's spiritual capacity—this is not deception but compassionate adaptation.

**Bodhisattva Path vs. Śrāvaka Path**: The chapter contrasts the bodhisattva ideal (represented by the 32,000 bodhisattvas and Ratnākara) with the Śrāvaka path (represented by Śāriputra). While both attain liberation, bodhisattvas work to purify lands and save beings, while śrāvakas seek personal nirvāṇa.

### Cross-References

- **Lotus Sutra, Chapter 16**: The revelation that this Sahā world is Śākyamuni's eternal pure land, hidden from those with impure vision—directly parallel to this chapter's teaching.
- **Avatamsaka Sutra**: The teaching that "mind creates all things" (*cittamātra*) resonates with "according to the purity of mind, the buddha-land becomes pure."
- **Platform Sutra**: Huineng's teaching "when the mind is pure, the buddha-land is pure" directly quotes this sutra.
- **Yogācāra Philosophy**: The teaching that external purity reflects internal purity anticipates the Yogācāra school's emphasis on consciousness-only (*vijñapti-mātra*).

## The Setting and the Assembly

**Source Text**:
如是我聞：一時，佛在毘耶離菴羅樹園...

**Translation**:
Thus have I heard: At one time the Buddha was in the city of Vaiśālī, in the Āmrapālī grove, staying with a great assembly of eight thousand bhikṣus and thirty-two thousand Bodhisattvas. 

These Bodhisattvas were well-known to the multitude; they had accomplished the fundamental practices of great wisdom and were established by the majestic spiritual power of the Buddhas. As guardians of the Dharma-city, they upheld the True Dharma. Their lion's roar resounded in the ten directions. Without being requested, they were friends who brought peace to others (*ana-arthita-kalyāṇamitra*). They promoted the prosperity of the Triple Gem, ensuring it would never be severed.

**Philological Commentary**:
*   **Vaiśālī**: A major commercial and political center in ancient India, home of the Licchavi republic.
*   **Āmrapālī Garden**: Donated by the famous courtesan Amrapali. In the Vimalakirti Sutra, this setting emphasizes the crossover between lay and monastic life.
*   **Uninvited Friends**: A key Mahayana concept. A Bodhisattva does not wait for a plea for help; compassion is proactive and spontaneous.

## Ratnakara's Verse of Praise

**Source Text**:
目淨脩廣如青蓮，心淨已度諸禪定...

**Translation**:
"Your eyes are pure, long and broad like the blue lotus;
Your mind is pure, having transcended all meditative states.
For long you have accumulated pure deeds, your fame is immeasurable;
You lead the multitude with tranquility—therefore I bow my head."

**Philological Commentary**:
*   **Blue Lotus** (*utpala*): A standard metaphor for the Buddha's eyes—serene, clear, and beautiful.
*   **Neither Existent nor Non-existent** (說法不有亦不無): Here, Kumārajīva's translation anticipates the Madhyamaka dialectic. The Buddha's teaching avoids the two extremes (*antau*).
*   **Empty, Signless, and Aimless**: The verse emphasizes the three doors of liberation (*vimokṣa-mukha*).

## The Purity of the Buddha Land

**Source Text**:
佛言：「寶積！眾生之類是菩薩佛土...」

**Translation**:
The Buddha said: "Ratnakara! The category of living beings is itself the Buddha-land of the Bodhisattva. Why is this? A Bodhisattva takes a Buddha-land according to the living beings he converts... for the purpose of benefiting living beings. 

Suppose a man wished to build a palace on a plot of open land; he could do so without obstacle. But if he tried to build it in empty space, he could never succeed. Likewise, a Bodhisattva, in order to bring living beings to completion, seeks to take a Buddha-land. Seeking to take a Buddha-land is not [building] in empty space."

"Ratnakara, you should know: 
1.  A **straightforward mind** (*ṛju-citta*) is the Bodhisattva's pure land; when he attains Buddhahood, beings who are not hypocritical will be born in his kingdom.
2.  A **profound mind** (*adhyāśaya*) is the Bodhisattva's pure land; when he attains Buddhahood, beings who are endowed with merit will be born there.
3.  **Bodhicitta** is the Bodhisattva's pure land; when he attains Buddhahood, beings of the Great Vehicle will be born there."

[The list continues through the Perfections, the Four Immeasurables, and the Thirty-seven Factors of Enlightenment...]

**Philological Commentary**:
*   **Beings as the Land**: This is a revolutionary shift in Mahayana thought. The "Pure Land" is not a reward for the Buddha, but a field of transformation for beings.
*   **Building in Space**: The metaphor emphasizes that spiritual practice must be grounded in the reality of human suffering and interaction. You cannot be a Bodhisattva in a vacuum.
*   **Straightforward Mind**: *Ṛju-citta* implies honesty, sincerity, and the absence of guile—the prerequisite for all further progress.

# Chapter 2: Skillful Means (方便品)

**Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel**

---

## Introduction of Vimalakirti

At that time, in the great city of Vaiśālī there was an elder named Vimalakirti.¹ He had already made offerings to immeasurable buddhas, had deeply planted wholesome roots,² and had attained the patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas.³ His eloquence was unobstructed; he sported with spiritual powers⁴ and had acquired all the dhāraṇīs.⁵ He had obtained fearlessness, had subdued Māra and his demonic forces. He had entered the profound Dharma-gate, was skilled in the perfection of wisdom,⁶ and had thoroughly mastered skillful means.⁷ His great vows had been accomplished. He clearly understood how the minds of sentient beings tend, and he was also able to distinguish the sharp and dull faculties of beings. Long had he been on the Buddha-path, his mind already ripened and resolved,⁸ his decision fixed on the Mahāyāna. Whatever he did, he was able to reflect skillfully. He dwelt in the Buddha's deportment, his mind vast as the ocean. All the buddhas praised him; he was revered by disciples, Śakra, Brahmā, and world-protectors.⁹

In order to save beings, he used skillful means to reside in Vaiśālī. His wealth was immeasurable, and he used it to embrace the poor. He was pure in upholding the precepts, and through this embraced those who violated the precepts. Through patient endurance and regulated conduct, he embraced those prone to anger. Through great vigor, he embraced the lazy. Through one-pointedness and meditative quiescence,¹⁰ he embraced those of scattered minds. Through decisive wisdom, he embraced those lacking wisdom.

Though he was a layman wearing white robes,¹¹ he maintained the pure discipline of a śramaṇa.¹² Though living the householder's life, he was unattached to the three realms.¹³ Though manifesting as having a wife and children, he constantly cultivated pure conduct.¹⁴ Though manifesting as having a household, he constantly delighted in solitude. Though wearing precious ornaments, he adorned his body with the marks and characteristics.¹⁵ Though eating and drinking,¹⁶ he relished the flavor of meditative joy. If he went to gambling halls and gaming houses, he used it solely to save beings. He received the teachings of various non-Buddhist paths without losing his true faith. Though well-versed in worldly texts, he constantly delighted in the Buddha-Dharma. He was revered by all who saw him, as the most excellent among those to be honored. Managing all livelihood and trade, though he acquired worldly gain, he took no joy in it.¹⁷

Traveling through the four main streets, he benefited sentient beings. Entering the halls of government, he protected all.¹⁸ Entering the houses of discourse, he led them with the Mahāyāna. Entering the schools, he enlightened the children.¹⁹ Entering the houses of prostitution, he revealed the transgressions of desire. Entering the wine houses, he could establish their resolve.

When among the elders, he was the most honored among elders, expounding the supreme Dharma. When among householders, he was the most honored among householders, severing their attachments. When among the kṣatriyas,²⁰ he was the most honored among kṣatriyas, teaching them patience. When among the brahmins,²¹ he was the most honored among brahmins, eliminating their pride. When among the great ministers, he was the most honored among great ministers, teaching them the true Dharma. When among the princes, he was the most honored among princes, revealing loyalty and filial piety. When among the palace officials, he was the most honored among palace officials, transforming the court women. When among the common people, he was the most honored among common people, causing them to cultivate merit. When among the Brahmā-devas, he was the most honored among Brahmā-devas, instructing them in supreme wisdom. When among Śakra, he was the most honored among Śakras, manifesting impermanence. When among the world-protectors, he was the most honored among world-protectors, protecting all sentient beings.

Thus did the elder Vimalakirti, using such immeasurable skillful means, benefit sentient beings.

## The Dharma of Impermanence: Vimalakirti's Teaching Through Illness

Using these skillful means, he manifested that his body was ill.²² Because of his illness, kings, great ministers, elders, householders, brahmins, and so forth, as well as princes and various officials—an uncountable multitude of thousands—all came to inquire about his illness.

To those who came, Vimalakirti, using his bodily illness, extensively expounded the Dharma:

"Benevolent ones! This body is impermanent,²³ without strength, without power, without solidity, a thing that rapidly decays—it cannot be trusted!²⁴ Being the source of suffering and affliction, it is where all diseases gather. Benevolent ones! Such a body the wise do not rely upon.

"This body is like a mass of foam—it cannot be grasped.²⁵ This body is like a bubble—it cannot long endure.²⁶ This body is like a mirage—born from thirst and craving.²⁷ This body is like a plantain tree—at its core there is nothing solid.²⁸ This body is like an illusion—arising from mental inversion.²⁹ This body is like a dream—perceived as a false vision. This body is like a shadow—appearing from karmic conditions.³⁰ This body is like an echo—dependent upon causes and conditions. This body is like a floating cloud—changing and dissolving in an instant.³¹ This body is like lightning—not abiding even for a thought-moment.³²

"This body is without a permanent master—it is like the earth.³³ This body is without a self—it is like fire.³⁴ This body is without longevity—it is like the wind.³⁵ This body is without a person—it is like water.³⁶ This body is not real—the four great elements are its home.³⁷ This body is empty—separate from 'I' and 'mine.'³⁸ This body is without awareness—like grass, trees, tiles, and pebbles. This body is without agency—turned by the power of the wind.³⁹ This body is not pure—filled with filth and corruption.⁴⁰ This body is falsity—though one bathes, clothes, and feeds it, it inevitably decays. This body is a disaster—afflicted by a hundred and one illnesses.⁴¹ This body is like an old well—pressed upon by age.⁴² This body has no fixed term—it will certainly die.⁴³ This body is like a venomous snake, like a hateful thief, like an empty village—it is a composite of the aggregates, realms, and sense-bases.⁴⁴

## The Buddha-Body: From the Conditioned to the Unconditioned

"Benevolent ones! This body should be despised and wearied of. You should take joy in the Buddha-body.⁴⁵ Why is this so? The Buddha-body is the Dharma-body.⁴⁶ It is born from immeasurable merit and wisdom. It is born from moral discipline, concentration, wisdom, liberation, and liberation-knowledge-and-vision.⁴⁷ It is born from loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity.⁴⁸ It is born from giving, moral discipline, patience, gentleness, diligent practice of vigor, meditative concentration, liberation, samādhi, learning, and the wisdom of the pāramitās.⁴⁹ It is born from skillful means. It is born from the six spiritual penetrations.⁵⁰ It is born from the three insights.⁵¹ It is born from the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment.⁵² It is born from cessation and contemplation.⁵³ It is born from the ten powers, four fearlessnesses, and eighteen unique qualities.⁵⁴ It is born from severing all unwholesome dharmas and gathering all wholesome dharmas. It is born from reality. It is born from non-negligence.⁵⁵

"From such immeasurable pure dharmas the Tathāgata's body is born. Benevolent ones! If you wish to attain the Buddha-body, to sever the illnesses of all sentient beings, you should generate the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*.⁵⁶"

Thus did the elder Vimalakirti, according to the occasion, expound the Dharma to those who came to inquire about his illness, causing countless thousands of persons to generate the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*.

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Footnotes

¹ **[Textual]** Vimalakirti (維摩詰, *Vimalakīrti*). Literally "Stainless Reputation" or "Pure Fame." A wealthy householder of Vaiśālī who exemplifies the Mahāyāna ideal of an enlightened layperson. His name in full is sometimes given as Vimalakirti-nirdeśa, "The Teaching of Vimalakirti." The fact that the sutra's protagonist is a layman rather than a monk is revolutionary, challenging the assumption that awakening is the exclusive domain of monastics.

² **[Philosophical]** Wholesome roots (善本, *kuśala-mūla*). The fundamental virtuous qualities that serve as the basis for spiritual development: non-greed, non-hatred, and non-delusion. Vimalakirti's "deep" planting of these roots indicates countless lifetimes of cultivation.

³ **[Philosophical]** Patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas (無生忍, *anutpattika-dharma-kṣānti*). A high bodhisattva attainment indicating direct realization that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence—they neither truly arise nor cease. This marks irreversibility on the path.

⁴ **[Philosophical]** Sporting with spiritual powers (遊戲神通, *ṛddhi-vikurvita*). The term "sporting" (遊戲) suggests that Vimalakirti uses supernatural abilities playfully, without attachment. Unlike powers demonstrated to impress, his are expressions of freedom and compassion. **[Cross-reference]** This playful use of powers will be dramatically demonstrated in Chapter 6 when he performs miraculous feats like fitting 32,000 lion-thrones in his small room.

⁵ **[Textual]** Dhāraṇī (總持, *dhāraṇī*). Mystical formulas or mnemonic devices that encapsulate teachings. Having "acquired all dhāraṇīs" means complete mastery of all Buddhist teachings.

⁶ **[Philosophical]** Perfection of wisdom (智度, *prajñā-pāramitā*). The culmination of Buddhist understanding—insight into the empty, interdependent nature of all phenomena. Vimalakirti embodies this perfection.

⁷ **[Philosophical]** Skillful means (方便, *upāya-kauśalya*). **KEY THEME** of this chapter. The adaptive methods by which awakened beings teach the Dharma in forms suited to the capacities of different beings. Vimalakirti's mastery of skillful means allows him to enter every sphere of society—from gambling halls to palaces to brothels—using each as an occasion for teaching.

⁸ **[Philosophical]** Mind ripened and resolved (心已純淑, *paripāka-citta*). The stage when a bodhisattva's mind has been purified through long practice and is ready for final awakening.

⁹ **[Textual]** World-protectors (世主, *lokapāla*). The four guardian kings who protect Buddhism and the world. That they revere Vimalakirti emphasizes his elevated spiritual status.

¹⁰ **[Philosophical]** Meditative quiescence (禪寂, *dhyāna-śānti*). Deep states of meditative absorption characterized by tranquility and clarity.

¹¹ **[Philosophical]** Wearing white robes (白衣, *avadāta-vasana*). Standard term for a layperson, in contrast to the colored or patched robes of monastics. The description that follows systematically contrasts Vimalakirti's external appearance as a worldly householder with his inner accomplishment as an awakened being.

¹² **[Textual]** Śramaṇa (沙門, *śramaṇa*). A religious mendicant or renunciant. The term originally applied to non-Brahmanical ascetics and was adopted by Buddhists to describe monks and nuns.

¹³ **[Philosophical]** Three realms (三界, *tri-dhātu*). The desire realm, form realm, and formless realm—the entire cosmos of rebirth. To be "unattached to the three realms" while living as a householder is the bodhisattva's achievement of liberation without withdrawal from the world.

¹⁴ **[Philosophical]** Pure conduct (梵行, *brahmacarya*). Traditionally implies celibacy, but here indicates that even while manifesting as a husband, Vimalakirti maintains the purity of one who has transcended desire. His family life is a teaching device, not a concession to worldliness.

¹⁵ **[Philosophical]** Marks and characteristics (相好, *lakṣaṇa-vyañjana*). The thirty-two major marks and eighty secondary characteristics of a buddha or advanced bodhisattva. Vimalakirti's true adornment is this spiritual radiance, not his jewelry.

¹⁶ **[Philosophical]** Though eating and drinking (雖復飲食). The text suggests that while he participates in worldly meals, his true nourishment is meditative joy (禪悅, *dhyāna-prīti*). **[Cross-reference]** This anticipates Chapter 10 on the Accumulated Fragrance Buddha, where food itself becomes a Dharma-teaching.

¹⁷ **[Philosophical]** No joy in worldly gain. Vimalakirti engages fully in commerce without attachment to profit—a model for the spirituality of the marketplace. **[Modern]** This anticipates contemporary discussions of "engaged Buddhism" and the integration of practice with ordinary life.

¹⁸ **[Textual]** Halls of government (治政法, *rāja-kārya*). Vimalakirti enters political spaces to protect beings, suggesting that governance can be a field of bodhisattva practice.

¹⁹ **[Textual]** Schools (學堂). The term 誘開童蒙 suggests leading children out of ignorance, making education another field of skillful means.

²⁰ **[Textual]** Kṣatriya (剎利, *kṣatriya*). The warrior and ruling class in Indian society. Teaching them "patience" (忍辱, *kṣānti*) addresses their particular predisposition to violence.

²¹ **[Textual]** Brahmin (婆羅門, *brāhmaṇa*). The priestly class. Teaching them to eliminate "pride" (我慢, *ātma-māna*) addresses their tendency toward spiritual arrogance.

²² **[Philosophical]** **CENTRAL TEACHING**: Vimalakirti's illness as skillful means (方便現身有疾). The chapter's core narrative device. Vimalakirti does not actually have an illness—he manifests illness as a teaching tool to attract visitors and create an opportunity for Dharma discourse. This brilliantly demonstrates that even suffering can be a form of compassionate activity. His "illness" mirrors the illness of all sentient beings bound by delusion and becomes the occasion for revealing the path to the Buddha-body.

²³ **[Philosophical]** Impermanent (無常, *anitya*). The first of the three marks of existence. The entire teaching that follows systematically exposes the body's lack of the four qualities misattributed to it by the deluded: permanence, strength, power, and solidity.

²⁴ **[Philosophical]** Cannot be trusted (不可信). The body's unreliability stems from its conditioned nature. This echoes the Buddha's final teaching in the Mahāparinibbāna Sutta: "All conditioned things are impermanent. Work out your salvation with diligence."

²⁵ **[Philosophical]** Like a mass of foam (如聚沫, *phenopiṇḍa*). From the *Phena Sutta* (SN 22.95), where the Buddha compares the five aggregates to foam, bubbles, mirages, plantain, and illusions. Vimalakirti draws directly from this imagery. **[Cross-reference]** This series of similes appears in multiple sutras and became a standard teaching on the insubstantiality of selfhood.

²⁶ **[Philosophical]** Like a bubble (如泡, *budbuda*). Water bubbles arise and burst instantaneously, illustrating the body's momentariness.

²⁷ **[Philosophical]** Like a mirage (如炎, *marīci*). The mirage arises from heat and craving (渴愛, *tṛṣṇā*), just as the illusory self arises from thirst for existence.

²⁸ **[Philosophical]** Like a plantain tree (如芭蕉, *kadalī*). The plantain trunk, when peeled layer by layer, reveals no solid core—a perfect metaphor for the body analyzed into its components.

²⁹ **[Philosophical]** Like an illusion from mental inversion (如幻從顛倒起, *viparyāsa*). The four inversions are seeing permanence in the impermanent, pleasure in suffering, self in the selfless, and purity in the impure. The illusory body arises from these cognitive distortions.

³⁰ **[Philosophical]** Like a shadow from karmic conditions (如影從業緣現). The body is a karmic shadow—not an independent entity but a projection of past actions appearing through causal conditions.

³¹ **[Philosophical]** Like a floating cloud (如浮雲). Clouds transform and disperse moment by moment, having no stable essence.

³² **[Philosophical]** Like lightning (如電念念不住). The most transient of all images—lightning exists for less than a moment. The phrase "念念不住" (not abiding even for a thought-moment) indicates the doctrine of momentariness (*kṣaṇika*): even within what appears to be a single moment, the body is constantly perishing and arising.

³³ **[Philosophical]** Like the earth, without permanent master (如地無主). The earth element in the body belongs to no one—it simply follows natural laws. The four element analysis (earth, water, fire, wind) that follows deconstructs the body into impersonal processes.

³⁴ **[Philosophical]** Like fire, without self (如火無我). The fire element (heat, digestion) operates without an agent directing it.

³⁵ **[Philosophical]** Like wind, without longevity (如風無壽). The breath and vital wind will inevitably cease—there is no permanent life-force.

³⁶ **[Philosophical]** Like water, without person (如水無人). The fluid elements in the body do not constitute a "person"—they are simply water following its nature.

³⁷ **[Philosophical]** Four great elements (四大, *mahā-bhūta*). Earth (solidity), water (cohesion), fire (heat), and wind (movement)—the physical constituents that make up the body. Calling them the body's "home" emphasizes that there is no self residing within, only these impersonal elements temporarily combined.

³⁸ **[Philosophical]** Empty, separate from 'I' and 'mine' (為空離我我所). The core teaching of *anātman*—the body contains neither a self nor anything belonging to a self. It is fundamentally empty of inherent existence.

³⁹ **[Philosophical]** Turned by the power of the wind (風力所轉). The body moves not by personal will but by the wind element and causal forces. This challenges the sense of agency we attribute to voluntary action.

⁴⁰ **[Philosophical]** Filled with filth (穢惡充滿). The traditional meditation on the thirty-two impure parts of the body, intended to counteract attachment through contemplation of the body's nature.

⁴¹ **[Textual]** Hundred and one illnesses (百一病). A conventional expression for the many diseases that afflict the body.

⁴² **[Philosophical]** Like an old well (如丘井). An old well that has run dry, pressed upon by the weight of age—unable to provide sustenance.

⁴³ **[Philosophical]** Will certainly die (為要當死). The body's only certainty is death. This "no fixed term" (無定) means death can come at any moment.

⁴⁴ **[Philosophical]** Composite of aggregates, realms, and sense-bases (陰界諸入所共合成). A technical summary of Buddhist phenomenology. The five aggregates (*skandha*), eighteen realms (*dhātu*), and twelve sense-bases (*āyatana*) are overlapping classification systems for analyzed experience. The body is nothing more than this combination—no self can be found in or outside these components. **[Cross-reference]** The "empty village" (空聚) image appears in the Pāli Canon as a metaphor for the selfless body.

⁴⁵ **[Philosophical]** Buddha-body (佛身, *buddhakāya*). The transition from aversion to the conditioned body to aspiration for the Buddha-body marks the pivot of Vimalakirti's teaching. However, this is not escapism—the Buddha-body is realized precisely through transformation of the present moment, not abandonment of embodied existence.

⁴⁶ **[Philosophical]** **KEY DOCTRINE**: Buddha-body is Dharma-body (佛身者即法身也, *buddhakāyo dharmakayas*). This equation is central to Mahāyāna christology. The Buddha's true body is not physical form but reality itself—the Dharma. This teaching will later develop into the trikāya (three-body) doctrine distinguishing the dharmakāya (dharma-body), saṃbhogakāya (enjoyment-body), and nirmāṇakāya (manifestation-body).

⁴⁷ **[Philosophical]** Liberation-knowledge-and-vision (解脫知見, *vimukti-jñāna-darśana*). The fifth of the five aspects of dharmakāya in earlier Abhidharma: morality, concentration, wisdom, liberation, and knowledge-and-vision of liberation.

⁴⁸ **[Philosophical]** Four immeasurables (慈悲喜捨, *brahma-vihāra*). Loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity—meditations that generate the emotional basis of the Buddha-body.

⁴⁹ **[Philosophical]** Pāramitās (波羅蜜, *pāramitā*). The "perfections" or transcendent virtues, usually listed as six: giving, morality, patience, vigor, concentration, and wisdom. This passage expands the list to include additional qualities.

⁵⁰ **[Philosophical]** Six spiritual penetrations (六通, *ṣaḍ-abhijñā*). Divine eye, divine ear, knowledge of others' minds, memory of past lives, supernatural powers, and knowledge of the exhaustion of outflows.

⁵¹ **[Philosophical]** Three insights (三明, *tisro vidyāḥ*). Knowledge of past lives, the divine eye seeing beings' deaths and rebirths, and knowledge that the outflows are exhausted.

⁵² **[Philosophical]** Thirty-seven factors of enlightenment (三十七道品, *saptatriṃśad-bodhipakṣika-dharmāḥ*). The complete set of practices leading to awakening.

⁵³ **[Philosophical]** Cessation and contemplation (止觀, *śamatha-vipaśyanā*). The two wings of meditation: calming (*śamatha*) and insight (*vipaśyanā*). Their cultivation is the proximate cause of awakening.

⁵⁴ **[Philosophical]** Ten powers, four fearlessnesses, and eighteen unique qualities. The special attributes of a fully awakened buddha.

⁵⁵ **[Philosophical]** Non-negligence (不放逸, *apramāda*). Careful mindfulness and spiritual vigilance. The Buddha's dying words emphasized *apramāda* as the key to liberation.

⁵⁶ **[Philosophical]** Generate the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi* (發阿耨多羅三藐三菩提心, *bodhicittotpāda*). The arising of the aspiration for supreme enlightenment—the fundamental act that initiates the bodhisattva path. Vimalakirti's entire discourse on the conditioned body's ills serves this ultimate purpose: to inspire the generation of *bodhicitta*.

**Skillful Means (*Upāya-kauśalya*)**: This chapter is the primary locus for the Vimalakirti Sutra's teaching on skillful means. Vimalakirti demonstrates that any context—secular or sacred, pure or impure—can become a field of awakening activity. His entry into gambling halls, brothels, and wine houses is not compromise but compassion in action. The enlightened mind transforms every situation into an opportunity for liberation.

**Lay Awakening**: The detailed description of Vimalakirti's lay status while surpassing monastic attainments is a direct challenge to the hierarchy that privileged renunciation over householder life. The sutra suggests that the distinction between lay and monastic is itself a form of dualistic thinking to be transcended. Vimalakirti "wears white robes" yet maintains "śramaṇa discipline"—form and formlessness coincide.

**Illness as Teaching**: Vimalakirti's manifested illness is the chapter's central device. It serves multiple functions: it draws visitors, creates an occasion for teaching, demonstrates non-attachment to the body, and—crucially—shows that even suffering can be skillful means. The bodhisattva does not eliminate suffering but transforms its meaning. This anticipates the sutra's later teachings on non-duality, where affliction and enlightenment are recognized as not-two.

**The Body Meditation**: The twelve similes for the body's impermanence and emptiness form a powerful contemplative sequence. These are not intellectual abstractions but objects for direct meditation. When fully realized, they lead to the "despising and wearying of" the conditioned body—not nihilistic disgust but liberating disenchantment that opens space for aspiration toward the Buddha-body.

**Buddha-Body as Dharma-Body**: The culminating teaching that "the Buddha-body is the Dharma-body" points beyond both the physical body and the mental constructs we project onto awakening. The Buddha's true body is truth itself—it is "born from" all the causes and conditions of awakening but is not produced as a conditioned thing. This is the body that transcends birth and death.

### Cross-References

## Vimalakirti's Expectation

At that time, the elder Vimalakirti thought to himself: "I am ill and lying in bed. Will the World-Honored One, with his great compassion, not condescend to take pity on me?"

The Buddha knew his intention and immediately addressed Śāriputra: "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

---

## Śāriputra Declines

Śāriputra addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, I was sitting in meditation¹ beneath a tree in the forest. At that time, Vimalakirti came and said to me:

"'Ah, Śāriputra! This sitting is not necessarily meditation. True meditation² means not manifesting body or mind in the three realms—this is meditation. Not arising from the absorption of cessation³ yet manifesting all deportments—this is meditation. Not abandoning the way of Dharma yet engaging in mundane affairs—this is meditation. The mind not abiding within nor being without—this is meditation. Not being moved by any views yet practicing the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment⁴—this is meditation. Not cutting off afflictions yet entering nirvāṇa—this is meditation. One who can sit thus is approved by the Buddha.'

"At that time—World-Honored One!—hearing these words, I remained silent and could not reply. Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

## Mahāmaudgalyāyana Declines

The Buddha addressed Mahāmaudgalyāyana:⁵ "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

Maudgalyāyana addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, I entered the great city of Vaiśālī and was expounding the Dharma to the householders in the lanes. At that time, Vimalakirti came and said to me:

"'Ah, Great Maudgalyāyana! When expounding the Dharma to white-robed householders, you should not teach as you have been teaching. One who expounds the Dharma should expound it according to the Dharma.⁶

"'The Dharma is without sentient beings, because it is free from the defilement of sentient beings. The Dharma is without self, because it is free from the defilement of self. The Dharma is without life-span, because it is free from birth and death. The Dharma is without persons, because the prior and subsequent moments are cut off.⁷ The Dharma is constantly quiescent, because all characteristics are extinguished. The Dharma is apart from characteristics, because there is no object of apprehension. The Dharma is without name or word, because verbal expression is cut off.⁸ The Dharma is without explanation, because it is free from thought and examination. The Dharma is without form, because it is like empty space. The Dharma is without conceptual proliferation,⁹ because it is ultimately empty. The Dharma is without "mine," because it is free from "mine." The Dharma is without discrimination, because it is free from all consciousnesses.¹⁰ The Dharma is without comparison, because there is nothing relative to it. The Dharma does not belong to causes, because it is not located in conditions.¹¹ The Dharma is identical with dharma-nature; it enters all dharmas. The Dharma accords with thusness; there is nothing it accords with. The Dharma abides at the true limit;¹² the various extremes do not move it. The Dharma is without movement or disturbance; it does not depend on the six sense-objects. The Dharma is without coming or going; it constantly does not abide. The Dharma conforms to emptiness, accords with signlessness, responds to wishlessness.¹³ The Dharma is apart from beauty and ugliness. The Dharma is without increase or decrease. The Dharma is without birth or extinction. The Dharma has no destination. The Dharma transcends eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. The Dharma is without high or low. The Dharma constantly abides without moving. The Dharma is apart from all conditioned practice.

"'Ah, Great Maudgalyāyana! The characteristic of Dharma being thus, how can it be spoken? One who expounds the Dharma neither speaks nor demonstrates; one who listens to the Dharma neither hears nor attains. It is like a conjurer¹⁴ expounding the Dharma to conjured beings—one should establish this understanding when expounding the Dharma.

"'You should understand that the faculties of sentient beings have sharp and dull capacities. Be skillful in knowing and seeing without obstruction. With the mind of great compassion, praise the Mahāyāna. Be mindful to repay the Buddha's kindness and not let the Three Jewels be cut off—only then should you expound the Dharma.'

"When Vimalakirti expounded this Dharma, eight hundred householders generated the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. I do not have this eloquence. Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

## Mahākāśyapa Declines

The Buddha addressed Mahākāśyapa:¹⁵ "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

Mahākāśyapa addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, I was begging for alms in the poor quarter. At that time, Vimalakirti came and said to me:

"'Ah, Mahākāśyapa! You have the mind of loving-kindness and compassion, yet you are not universal in applying it—you bypass the wealthy and beg from the poor.¹⁶ Kāśyapa! Abide in the Dharma of equality and beg for food in proper sequence. Because you do not need to eat, you should beg for food. In order to destroy the characteristic of composite unity,¹⁷ you should receive morsels. Because you do not receive, you should accept their food.

"'Enter the village with the perception of an empty aggregation.¹⁸ Regard the forms you see the same as a blind man sees. Regard the sounds you hear the same as an echo. Regard the fragrances you smell the same as the wind. Regard the tastes you eat without discrimination. Accept all tangible objects as if they were cognitive wisdom. Know all dharmas to be illusory in nature—without self-nature, without other-nature, originally not being so, and even now without extinction.¹⁹

"'Kāśyapa! If you can avoid rejecting the eight deviations²⁰ and enter the eight liberations,²¹ using deviant characteristics to enter the true Dharma; if with a single meal you can make offerings to all, making offerings to all buddhas and the assemblies of noble sages, and only then eat—eating in this way, you are neither with afflictions nor apart from afflictions, neither entering concentration nor arising from concentration, neither dwelling in the worldly nor dwelling in nirvāṇa. Those who give to you will have neither great merit nor small merit—it neither benefits them nor harms them. This is correctly entering the Buddha-Way, not relying on the way of the śrāvakas.²² Kāśyapa! If you eat in this way, you do not vainly consume people's alms-offerings.'

"At that time—World-Honored One!—hearing these words, I experienced what I had never experienced before, and I immediately arose profound respect for all bodhisattvas. I further thought: 'This one bearing a householder's name²³ has such eloquence and wisdom! Who, hearing this, would not generate the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*?' From then on, I no longer encouraged people to follow the ways of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas.²⁴ Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

## Subhūti Declines

The Buddha addressed Subhūti:²⁵ "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

Subhūti addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, I entered his house to beg for food. At that time, Vimalakirti took my bowl, filled it with rice, and said to me:

"'Ah, Subhūti! If you can be equal regarding food, then all dharmas are also equal. If all dharmas are equal, then you are also equal regarding food.²⁶ Begging in this way, you may take the food.

"'Subhūti! If you do not cut off lust, anger, and delusion, yet are not bound by them; if you do not destroy the body yet accord with the single characteristic;²⁷ if you do not extinguish delusion and craving yet give rise to insight and liberation;²⁸ if with the characteristics of the five grave offenses you attain liberation,²⁹ yet are neither liberated nor bound; if you do not see the Four Noble Truths, yet it is not that you have not seen the truths; if you do not attain the fruits, yet it is not that you have not attained the fruits; if you are neither an ordinary person nor apart from the dharmas of ordinary persons; if you are neither a sage nor not a sage; if, though you accomplish all dharmas, you are apart from the characteristics of all dharmas—then you may take the food.

"'If, Subhūti, you do not see the Buddha and do not hear the Dharma—if those six heterodox teachers,³⁰ Pūraṇa Kāśyapa, Maskarin Gośālīputra, Sañjayin Vairaṭīputra, Ajita Keśakambala, Kakuda Kātyāyana, and Nirgrantha Jñātṛputra—if these are your teachers, and you leave home following them, and wherever those teachers fall, you also fall—then you may take the food.

"'If, Subhūti, you enter wrong views and do not reach the other shore; if you dwell in the eight difficulties³¹ and do not attain freedom from difficulty; if you are identified with afflictions and separated from pure dharmas; if you attain the samādhi of non-contention,³² yet all sentient beings also attain this samādhi; if those who give to you are not called a field of merit; if those who make offerings to you fall into the three evil paths; if you join hands with Māra and make all distressed ones your companions; if you are no different from all māras and all afflictions; if you have enmity toward all sentient beings, slander all buddhas, and destroy the Dharma; if you are not numbered among the assembly and will never attain final nirvāṇa—if you are thus, then you may take the food.'

"At that time—World-Honored One!—hearing these words, I was bewildered,³³ not understanding what he was saying or how to reply. I set down my bowl and wished to leave his house. Vimalakirti said:

"'Ah, Subhūti! Take your bowl—do not be afraid. What do you think? If a transformation-being³⁴ created by the Tathāgata were questioned about this matter, would he be afraid?'

"I said: 'No.'

"Vimalakirti said: 'All dharmas are like illusory transformations. You should have no fear now. Why is this so? All verbal expressions do not depart from this characteristic.³⁵ As for the wise, they are not attached to words and therefore have no fear. Why is this so? The nature of words is empty—there are no words. This is liberation. The characteristic of liberation is the characteristic of all dharmas.'

"When Vimalakirti expounded this Dharma, two hundred devas attained the pure Dharma-eye. Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

---

## Pūrṇa Declines

The Buddha addressed Pūrṇamatrāyaṇīputra:³⁶ "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

Pūrṇa addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, I was in the great forest³⁷ beneath a tree, expounding the Dharma to some newly-ordained bhikṣus. At that time, Vimalakirti came and said to me:

"'Ah, Pūrṇa! First you should enter samādhi and observe the minds of these persons, then expound the Dharma. Do not place defiled food in a precious vessel.³⁸ You should know what these bhikṣus are thinking. Do not confuse lapis lazuli with crystal.³⁹ You cannot know the roots and sources of sentient beings—do not presume to give rise to the Hīnayāna Dharma.⁴⁰ They themselves are without wounds—do not wound them. Those wishing to walk the great path should not be shown the small path. Do not put the great ocean into an ox's hoofprint. Do not treat sunlight the same as the light of a firefly.

"'Pūrṇa! These bhikṣus long ago generated the Mahāyāna mind but in the middle forgot this intention. Why do you instruct them with the Hīnayāna Dharma? I observe that the wisdom of the Hīnayāna is shallow and petty, like a blind person unable to distinguish the sharp and dull faculties of sentient beings.'

"At that time, Vimalakirti immediately entered samādhi and caused those bhikṣus to know their former lives:⁴¹ they had planted roots of merit under five hundred buddhas and had dedicated them toward *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. Immediately their realization was clear, and they regained their original minds. Thereupon all the bhikṣus bowed at Vimalakirti's feet. At that time, Vimalakirti expounded the Dharma to them, and they became irreversible from *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*.

"I thought that śrāvakas who do not observe the faculties of people should not teach the Dharma. Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

---

## Mahākātyāyana Declines

The Buddha addressed Mahākātyāyana:⁴² "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

Kātyāyana addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, after the Buddha briefly expounded the essential teachings to the bhikṣus, I afterward elaborated on their meaning—the meaning of impermanence, the meaning of suffering, the meaning of emptiness, the meaning of non-self, the meaning of quiescence.⁴³ At that time, Vimalakirti came and said to me:

"'Ah, Kātyāyana! Do not use the mind of arising and ceasing⁴⁴ to explain the Dharma of true reality.⁴⁵ Kātyāyana! All dharmas ultimately neither arise nor cease—this is the meaning of impermanence.⁴⁶ The five appropriated aggregates,⁴⁷ penetrated through, are empty and without arising—this is the meaning of suffering.⁴⁸ All dharmas ultimately have nothing whatsoever—this is the meaning of emptiness.⁴⁹ Self and no-self are not two—this is the meaning of non-self.⁵⁰ The Dharma originally was not so, and even now is without extinction—this is the meaning of quiescence.'⁵¹

"When he expounded this Dharma, all those bhikṣus liberated their minds. Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

---

## Aniruddha Declines

The Buddha addressed Aniruddha:⁵² "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

Aniruddha addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, I was doing walking meditation in a certain place. At that time, a Brahmā-king named Śubhavyūha,⁵³ together with ten thousand Brahmās, emitting pure radiance, came to me, bowed with his head at my feet, and asked:

"'How far does the divine eye of Aniruddha see?'

"I immediately replied: 'Benevolent one! I see the entire trichiliocosm of Śākyamuni Buddha, as if viewing an āmalaka fruit⁵⁴ in the palm of my hand.'

"At that time, Vimalakirti came and said to me: 'Ah, Aniruddha! Does what the divine eye sees have the characteristic of conditioned activity or the characteristic of non-conditioned activity?⁵⁵ If it has the characteristic of conditioned activity, then it is the same as the five supernatural powers of the heterodox teachers. If it is the characteristic of non-conditioned activity, then it is the unconditioned and should not have seeing.'

"World-Honored One! At that time I remained silent. The Brahmās, hearing his words, experienced what they had never experienced before, and immediately bowed to him and asked: 'Who in the world truly possesses the divine eye?'

"Vimalakirti said: 'There is—the Buddha, the World-Honored One, possesses the true divine eye.⁵⁶ Constantly abiding in samādhi, he sees all buddha-lands without the characteristic of duality.'

"Thereupon, the Brahmā-king Śubhavyūha and his retinue of five hundred Brahmā-devas all generated the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. Having bowed at Vimalakirti's feet, they suddenly vanished. Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

---

## Upāli Declines

The Buddha addressed Upāli:⁵⁷ "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

Upāli addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, two bhikṣus had violated the Vinaya rules⁵⁸ and were ashamed to ask the Buddha. They came to ask me:

"'Upāli! We have violated the Vinaya and are truly ashamed. We dare not ask the Buddha. We hope you will resolve our doubts and regret so we may be freed from this fault.'

"I immediately explained to them according to the Dharma. At that time, Vimalakirti came and said to me:

"'Ah, Upāli! Do not add to the guilt of these two bhikṣus! You should directly eliminate it; do not disturb their minds. Why is this so? The nature of that guilt is not internal, not external, and not in between.⁵⁹ As the Buddha has said, when the mind is defiled, sentient beings are defiled; when the mind is pure, sentient beings are pure. The mind, too, is not internal, not external, and not in between. As the mind is, so too is the guilt-defilement; so too are all dharmas—not departing from thusness.⁶⁰

"'Upāli! When the mind-characteristic attains liberation, is there defilement or not?'

"I said: 'There is not.'

"Vimalakirti said: 'The mind-characteristic of all sentient beings being without defilement is also like this. Ah, Upāli! Delusive thinking is defilement; no delusive thinking is purity. Inversion is defilement; no inversion is purity. Grasping a self is defilement; not grasping a self is purity.

"'Upāli! All dharmas arise and cease without abiding, like illusion, like lightning.⁶¹ Dharmas do not wait for each other—they do not even abide for a single moment. All dharmas are false appearances, like a dream, like a flame, like the moon in water, like a reflection in a mirror—they arise from delusive thinking. One who knows this is called one who upholds the Vinaya. One who knows this is called one who has good understanding.'

"Thereupon the two bhikṣus said: 'Supreme wisdom! This is something Upāli cannot match—the foremost upholder of the Vinaya, yet he cannot speak thus!'⁶²

"I immediately replied: 'Setting aside the Tathāgata, no śrāvaka or bodhisattva can match his joyful eloquence—his wisdom and insight are so brilliant!'

"At that time, the two bhikṣus' doubt and regret were immediately removed. They generated the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi* and made this vow: 'May all sentient beings attain this eloquence!'

"Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

---

## Rāhula Declines

The Buddha addressed Rāhula:⁶³ "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

Rāhula addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, the elder's sons of Vaiśālī came to me, bowed with their heads at my feet, and asked:

"'Rāhula! You are the son of the Buddha. You renounced the position of a wheel-turning king and left home to pursue the Way. What benefits does leaving home have?'

"I immediately explained the benefits and merits of leaving home according to the Dharma. At that time, Vimalakirti came and said to me:

"'Ah, Rāhula! You should not speak of the benefits and merits of leaving home.⁶⁴ Why is this so? That which is without benefit and without merit—that is leaving home. The conditioned dharmas can be spoken of as having benefit and merit. But leaving home is the unconditioned dharma, and in the unconditioned there is no benefit and no merit.

"'Rāhula! Leaving home is being without this and without that, and without the middle between them.⁶⁵ It is apart from the sixty-two views,⁶⁶ abiding in nirvāṇa. It is what the wise accept and what the noble practice. It is conquering the hosts of māras, crossing beyond the five destinies, purifying the five eyes, attaining the five powers, and establishing the five faculties. It is not disturbing others and departing from various evils. It is crushing the heterodox teachers and transcending conventional designations. It is emerging from the mire without attachment, without "mine," without reception, without disturbance, cherishing inner joy, guarding others' minds, according with meditation, and departing from all faults. If one is able to be thus—this is true leaving home.'

"Then Vimalakirti said to the elder's sons: 'It is appropriate that you all leave home in the true Dharma together. Why is this so? It is hard to meet a buddha-age!'

"The elder's sons said: 'Elder! We have heard the Buddha say that if one's parents do not give permission, one cannot leave home.'

"Vimalakirti said: 'So it is! Then you should all generate the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*—this is leaving home, this is complete ordination.⁶⁷'

"At that time, thirty-two elder's sons all generated the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

---

## Ānanda Declines

The Buddha addressed Ānanda:⁶⁸ "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

Ānanda addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, when the World-Honored One's body had a slight illness and required cow's milk, I immediately took my bowl and went to stand at the gate of a great brahmin's house. At that time, Vimalakirti came and said to me:

"'Ah, Ānanda! Why are you standing here with your bowl in the early morning?'

"I said: 'Elder! The World-Honored One's body has a slight illness and requires cow's milk, so I have come here.'

"Vimalakirti said: 'Stop, stop, Ānanda! Do not say such things! The Tathāgata's body is a vajra body;⁶⁹ all evils have been cut off; all goodness has gathered together. What illness could there be? What affliction could there be?

"'Go silently, Ānanda! Do not slander the Tathāgata. Do not let others hear such coarse words. Do not let the great, powerfully-virtuous devas and the bodhisattvas who have come from other pure lands hear these words.

"'Ānanda! A wheel-turning sage-king, because of just a little merit, is free from illness.⁷⁰ How much more so the Tathāgata, whose immeasurable accumulated merit is universally victorious! Go, Ānanda! Do not make us receive such disgrace. If the heterodox teachers and brahmins were to hear these words, they would think: "How can he be called a teacher? He cannot save his own illness—how can he save the illnesses of others?" You should leave quickly and secretly—do not let others hear.

"'You should know, Ānanda, the bodies of all tathāgatas are the Dharma-body, not the body of thought and desire.⁷¹ The Buddha is the World-Honored One, transcending the three realms. The Buddha's body is without outflows—all outflows are exhausted. The Buddha's body is unconditioned—it does not fall within enumeration.⁷² Such a body—what illness could it have? What affliction could it have?'

"At that time—World-Honored One!—I was truly ashamed. Had I perhaps, being close to the Buddha, made an error in hearing?⁷³ Immediately I heard a voice from the sky saying: 'Ānanda! What the elder says is true. But it is because the Buddha has appeared in the five turbidities of the evil age⁷⁴ that he performs this practice to liberate sentient beings. Go, Ānanda! Take the milk and do not be ashamed.'

"World-Honored One! Such is Vimalakirti's wisdom and eloquence! Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

## Conclusion

Thus did all five hundred great disciples each explain to the Buddha the account of their own past encounter, describing what Vimalakirti had said, and all declared they were not capable of going to inquire about his illness.

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Footnotes

¹ **[Philosophical]** Sitting in meditation (宴坐, *dhyāna-niṣadya*). The term refers to formal seated meditation, the foundational practice of early Buddhism. Vimalakirti challenges the external form, pointing to the essence of meditation.

² **[Philosophical]** True meditation (宴坐). Vimalakirti redefines meditation away from sitting posture toward a non-dual state of being. His six definitions of meditation systematically deconstruct dualities: active/passive, mundane/transcendent, interior/exterior, views/practice, affliction/liberation.

³ **[Philosophical]** Absorption of cessation (滅定, *nirodha-samāpatti*). The highest meditative attainment in early Buddhism, in which all mental activity ceases. Vimalakirti's point: true meditation maintains liberation *while* engaging in activity, not by withdrawing from activity.

⁴ **[Philosophical]** Thirty-seven factors of enlightenment (三十七品, *saptatriṃśad-bodhipakṣika-dharmāḥ*). The complete Buddhist path. Vimalakirti says one can practice all these while remaining unmoved by views—practice without attachment.

⁵ **[Textual]** Mahāmaudgalyāyana (大目犍連, *Mahāmaudgalyāyana*). "Great Moggallāna." The foremost disciple in supernatural powers. His teaching is rebuked for not according with the Dharma's true nature.

⁶ **[Philosophical]** **KEY THEME**: Dharma according to Dharma. This begins one of the sutra's most profound philosophical passages: a systematic via negativa describing what Dharma truly is by denying all predicates. The twenty-plus characteristics listed form a complete deconstruction of conceptual categories.

⁷ **[Philosophical]** Prior and subsequent moments cut off (前後際斷). Time dissolves under analysis; there is no continuous "person" linking past to future.

⁸ **[Philosophical]** Verbal expression cut off (言語斷). The Dharma transcends language. **[Cross-reference]** This anticipates Chapter 9's teaching on non-duality and Vimalakirti's famous silence.

⁹ **[Philosophical]** Conceptual proliferation (戲論, *prapañca*). Mental elaboration that obscures reality. The Dharma is free from all such elaboration.

¹⁰ **[Philosophical]** Free from all consciousnesses (離諸識). Beyond the eight consciousnesses of Yogācāra philosophy.

¹¹ **[Philosophical]** Not in causes or conditions. The Dharma is not produced; it is not the effect of causes.

¹² **[Philosophical]** True limit (實際, *bhūta-koṭi*). The absolute reality where all distinctions end.

¹³ **[Philosophical]** Three gates of liberation (空、無相、無作; *śūnyatā*, *animitta*, *apraṇihita*). Emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness—the three samādhis leading to nirvāṇa.

¹⁴ **[Philosophical]** Conjurer and conjured beings (幻士幻人). **This powerful image undercuts the entire enterprise of teaching**: if both teacher and audience are illusory, what is teaching? The answer: teaching occurs, but without the solidity we attribute to it.

¹⁵ **[Textual]** Mahākāśyapa (大迦葉, *Mahākāśyapa*). "Great Kāśyapa." Foremost in ascetic practices (dhūtaguṇa), known for extreme austerity. The epitome of the dhūta-bhikṣu.

¹⁶ **[Philosophical]** Bypassing the wealthy and begging from the poor. Kāśyapa avoided wealthy homes out of discomfort with their offerings. Vimalakirti exposes this as partiality—a failure of true compassion, which is universal.

¹⁷ **[Philosophical]** Composite unity (和合相). The false appearance of unified selfhood. Eating mindfully deconstructs even the alms-round itself.

¹⁸ **[Philosophical]** Empty aggregation (空聚). The village perceived as empty of inherent existence—the aggregates themselves are empty "villages" with no self residing in them.

¹⁹ **[Philosophical]** Originally not being so (本自不然). A key Mādhyamika formula: phenomena never had inherent existence; there was never anything to be destroyed. **[Cross-reference]** This echoes the Heart Sutra's "no ignorance and no extinction of ignorance."

²⁰ **[Textual]** Eight deviations (八邪). Wrong view, thought, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration—opposites of the Noble Eightfold Path.

²¹ **[Textual]** Eight liberations (八解脫, *aṣṭau vimokṣāḥ*). Progressive meditative attainments culminating in the cessation of perception and feeling.

²² **[Philosophical]** Not relying on the śrāvaka way. Kāśyapa's previous approach was śrāvaka-style: seeking personal liberation through asceticism. The bodhisattva way transforms every action into benefit for all.

²³ **[Philosophical]** Bearing a householder's name (有家名). Emphasis that Vimalakirti is "just a layman" with such profound realization—astounding.

²⁴ **[Philosophical]** Pratyekabuddha (辟支佛, *pratyekabuddha*). "Solitary Buddha." One who attains awakening alone without teaching others. Like śrāvakas, they represent limited realization from the Mahāyāna perspective.

²⁵ **[Textual]** Subhūti (須菩提, *Subhūti*). Foremost in understanding emptiness, the master of *śūnyatā*. His encounter with Vimalakirti is especially rich, as both are specialists in emptiness.

²⁶ **[Philosophical]** Equality regarding food and dharmas. For one who realizes emptiness, there is no distinction between food and all phenomena—all equally empty, equally real.

²⁷ **[Philosophical]** Single characteristic (一相). The characteristic of no characteristic—*nirākāra*.

²⁸ **[Philosophical]** Insight and liberation (明脫). Not through cutting off delusion, but through seeing through it.

²⁹ **[Philosophical]** Five grave offenses (五逆). Killing father, mother, or an arhat; shedding a buddha's blood; creating schism in the saṅgha. These are the most serious karmic offenses. Vimalakirti says even through these characteristics one can be liberated—ultimate non-attachment transcends even karma.

³⁰ **[Textual]** Six heterodox teachers. The six non-Buddhist teachers contemporary with the Buddha, representing materialist, fatalist, amoralist, and skeptical positions. Vimalakirti's point: if you're truly empty, what difference is there?

³¹ **[Textual]** Eight difficulties (八難). The conditions making Dharma-encounter difficult.

³² **[Philosophical]** Samādhi of non-contention (無諍三昧, *araṇa-samādhi*). Subhūti's specialty—perfect peace without conflict.

³³ **[Philosophical]** Bewildered (茫然). Subhūti, the emptiness-master, is stunned by Vimalakirti's paradoxical statements. The teaching uses negation to push beyond conceptual understanding.

³⁴ **[Philosophical]** Transformation-being (化人). An illusory person created by a buddha's power. If such a being were questioned, it would not fear because it knows it has no substantial existence.

³⁵ **[Philosophical]** All verbal expressions do not depart from this characteristic. Language itself is empty—words are just as illusory as the conjured beings mentioned earlier. Liberation is the nature of words themselves.

³⁶ **[Textual]** Pūrṇamatrāyaṇīputra (富樓那彌多羅尼子, *Pūrṇa Maitrāyaṇīputra*). "Pūrṇa, son of Maitrāyaṇī." Foremost in preaching the Dharma.

³⁷ **[Textual]** The great forest (大林). The Mahāvana near Vaiśālī.

³⁸ **[Philosophical]** Defiled food in a precious vessel. Inappropriate to put Hīnayāna teachings into minds capable of Mahāyāna realization.

³⁹ **[Philosophical]** Lapis lazuli and crystal. Don't treat the precious as ordinary. These bhikṣus are Mahāyāna vessels mistakenly treated as Hīnayāna.

⁴⁰ **[Philosophical]** Hīnayāna Dharma (小乘法). The "Lesser Vehicle"—here referring to teachings focused on personal liberation rather than bodhisattva-hood.

⁴¹ **[Philosophical]** Knowing former lives. Through his samādhi, Vimalakirti reveals the bhikṣus' past-life aspirations, awakening their dormant Mahāyāna spirit.

⁴² **[Textual]** Mahākātyāyana (摩訶迦旃延, *Mahākātyāyana*). Foremost in detailed analytical exposition of the Buddha's terse teachings.

⁴³ **[Philosophical]** Five meanings. Kātyāyana's standard Abhidharma expositions: impermanence, suffering, emptiness, non-self, quiescence. Vimalakirti re-interprets each in Mahāyāna terms.

⁴⁴ **[Philosophical]** Mind of arising and ceasing (生滅心行). Conventional thinking that sees phenomena as truly arising and ceasing. This is the obstacle.

⁴⁵ **[Philosophical]** Dharma of true reality (實相法). *Dharmatā*—reality as it is, beyond arising and ceasing.

⁴⁶ **[Philosophical]** **REINTERPRETATION OF IMPERMANENCE**: Impermanence does not mean things arise and pass away; rather, nothing ever truly arises or ceases. This is the Mādhyamika understanding.

⁴⁷ **[Philosophical]** Five appropriated aggregates (五受陰, *pañcopādāna-skandha*). Form, feeling, perception, formations, consciousness as grasped at.

⁴⁸ **[Philosophical]** **REINTERPRETATION OF SUFFERING**: Suffering is not phenomenal distress but the emptiness of the aggregates themselves.

⁴⁹ **[Philosophical]** **REINTERPRETATION OF EMPTINESS**: Not the analytical absence of self, but ultimate non-existence of all dharmas.

⁵⁰ **[Philosophical]** **REINTERPRETATION OF NON-SELF**: Not merely the absence of a self in phenomena, but the non-duality of self and non-self.

⁵¹ **[Philosophical]** **REINTERPRETATION OF QUIESCENCE**: Not the cessation of something that existed, but recognition that nothing ever needed to be extinguished.

⁵² **[Textual]** Aniruddha (阿那律, *Aniruddha*). Foremost in the divine eye (天眼, *divya-cakṣus*).

⁵³ **[Textual]** Śubhavyūha (嚴淨, *Śubhavyūha*). "Splendid Array." A Brahmā-king.

⁵⁴ **[Textual]** Āmalaka fruit (菴摩勒果). The emblic myrobalan, a small Indian fruit often used as an example of something seen clearly.

⁵⁵ **[Philosophical]** Conditioned vs. unconditioned characteristic. Vimalakirti's incisive question: if seeing is conditioned (mental), it's merely mundane power; if unconditioned, there should be no seeing. This exposes the logical limits of Aniruddha's claim.

⁵⁶ **[Philosophical]** True divine eye. The Buddha's seeing is beyond the duality of conditioned/unconditioned—he sees all buddha-lands without dual characteristics.

⁵⁷ **[Textual]** Upāli (優波離, *Upāli*). Foremost in Vinaya (discipline). His specialty is rules; Vimalakirti transcends rules.

⁵⁸ **[Textual]** Vinaya rules (律行). The monastic code. The two bhikṣus' violation is unspecified.

⁵⁹ **[Philosophical]** Not internal, external, or in between. The standard Mādhyamika negation of location. Guilt, like all dharmas, is unfindable.

⁶⁰ **[Philosophical]** Not departing from thusness (不出於如如). All phenomena—including guilt—are expressions of thusness (*tathatā*). Nothing falls outside reality.

⁶¹ **[Philosophical]** Like illusion, like lightning. Standard images for impermanence and insubstantiality.

⁶² **[Philosophical]** The Vinaya master cannot match this understanding. The irony: the discipline-specialist lacks the wisdom to truly resolve guilt. True Vinaya is understanding the empty nature of transgression itself.

⁶³ **[Textual]** Rāhula (羅睺羅, *Rāhula*). The Buddha's son; foremost in inconspicuous practice (密行).

⁶⁴ **[Philosophical]** Benefits of leaving home. Rāhula's conventional answer focused on the merit of renunciation. Vimalakirti points to leaving home as unconditioned—beyond benefit.

⁶⁵ **[Philosophical]** Without this, that, or middle. Complete non-duality—no here, there, or between.

⁶⁶ **[Textual]** Sixty-two views (六十二見). The wrong views catalogued in early Buddhism, mostly variations on eternalism and annihilationism.

⁶⁷ **[Philosophical]** **REVOLUTIONARY TEACHING**: Generating bodhicitta IS leaving home. One need not physically leave family if one generates the awakening mind. This redefines ordination as internal transformation, accessible to laypeople.

⁶⁸ **[Textual]** Ānanda (阿難, *Ānanda*). The Buddha's attendant; foremost in hearing and memory. His encounter reveals the highest teaching on the Buddha's body.

⁶⁹ **[Philosophical]** Vajra body (金剛之體). The indestructible body of the Buddha. Vimalakirti insists that it is a mistake to speak of the Buddha as having ordinary illness.

⁷⁰ **[Philosophical]** Wheel-turning king free from illness. Even mundane merit protects from disease; how much more the Buddha's infinite merit?

⁷¹ **[Philosophical]** **KEY DOCTRINE**: Dharma-body, not the body of thought and desire. The Buddha's true body is the Dharma-body (*dharmakāya*)—unconditioned, beyond form. This teaching on the Buddha's nature is foundational for Mahāyāna Buddhology.

⁷² **[Philosophical]** Does not fall within enumeration (不墮諸數). The Buddha's body is beyond categorization—it cannot be counted among beings or phenomena.

⁷³ **[Textual]** Error in hearing. Ānanda, famous for hearing perfectly, here doubts himself.

⁷⁴ **[Textual]** Five turbidities (五濁). The five degenerations of the evil age: kalpa-turbidity, affliction-turbidity, sentient-being turbidity, view-turbidity, and life-span turbidity.

### Key Concepts

**Dharma Combat (辯論)**: Each encounter between Vimalakirti and a disciple is a form of "dharma combat"—a verbal exchange that exposes limitations and catalyzes deeper realization. The disciples are not defeated but educated; their humility shows spiritual maturity.

**The Superior Layman**: The chapter systematically establishes Vimalakirti's superiority over all the Buddha's foremost disciples—each renowned for a particular specialty. This makes a powerful statement about the potential for lay awakening and the limitations of specialized spiritual attainments.

**Non-Dual Understanding**: Each teaching Vimalakirti offers transcends dualities that the disciples still unconsciously maintain: sitting/not-sitting, pure/impure, wealthy/poor, views/practice, guilt/innocence, leaving home/staying home, healthy/ill.

**The True Nature of Dharma**: Maudgalyāyana's encounter contains a complete Mādhyamika philosophy of language and reality—the Dharma is beyond all predicates yet is expressed in all phenomena.

## Introduction

Thereupon the Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Maitreya:¹ "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

---

## Maitreya Declines

Maitreya addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, I was expounding to the Tuṣita Heaven king and his retinue the practices of the stage of non-retrogression.² At that time, Vimalakirti came and said to me:

"'Maitreya! The World-Honored One has given you the prediction that in one more lifetime you will attain *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*.³ Which lifetime is it that you received the prediction regarding? Is it the past lifetime? The future lifetime? Or the present lifetime?

"'If it is the past lifetime, the past lifetime has already perished. If it is the future lifetime, the future lifetime has not yet arrived. If it is the present lifetime, the present lifetime does not abide.⁴ As the Buddha has said: "Bhikṣu! In this very moment you are also being born, also aging, and also dying."⁵

"'If you received the prediction on the basis of non-arising,⁶ then non-arising is precisely the ultimate position.⁷ In the ultimate position, there is neither receiving prediction nor attaining *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. How then did Maitreya receive the one-lifetime prediction?

"'Did you receive the prediction from thusness arising or from thusness ceasing?⁸ If you received the prediction from thusness arising, thusness does not arise. If you received the prediction from thusness ceasing, thusness does not cease.

"'All sentient beings are thusness.⁹ All dharmas are also thusness. All holy sages are also thusness. And Maitreya is also thusness. If Maitreya receives a prediction, all sentient beings should also receive a prediction. Why is this so? Thusness is non-dual and non-different.¹⁰ If Maitreya attains *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*, all sentient beings should also attain it. Why is this so? All sentient beings are precisely the characteristic of bodhi.¹¹ If Maitreya attains nirvāṇa, all sentient beings should also attain nirvāṇa. Why is this so? All buddhas know that all sentient beings are ultimately quiescent, that this is the characteristic of nirvāṇa—there is no further extinction to undergo.¹²

"'Therefore, Maitreya! Do not seduce these deva-sons with this teaching. In reality, no one generates the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*, and no one retrogresses from it. Maitreya! You should cause these deva-sons to abandon their discriminating views regarding bodhi. Why is this so?

"'Bodhi cannot be attained by body and cannot be attained by mind.¹³ Quiescence is bodhi, because all characteristics are extinguished. Non-viewing is bodhi, because all conditions are abandoned. Non-action is bodhi, because there is no recollection. Cutting off is bodhi, because all views are relinquished. Separation is bodhi, because all delusive thoughts are abandoned. Obstruction is bodhi, because all aspirations are obstructed.¹⁴ Non-entry is bodhi, because there is no attachment. Accordance is bodhi, because it accords with thusness. Abiding is bodhi, because it abides in dharma-nature. Reaching is bodhi, because it reaches the true limit.¹⁵ Non-duality is bodhi, because it is apart from mind and mental objects.¹⁶ Equality is bodhi, because it equals empty space. Unconditioned is bodhi, because it is without arising, abiding, or ceasing. Knowing is bodhi, because it comprehends the mental activities of sentient beings. Non-meeting is bodhi, because all sense-bases do not meet.¹⁷ Non-uniting is bodhi, because it is apart from the residue of afflictions. No location is bodhi, because it is without form or color. Provisional name is bodhi, because names and words are empty.¹⁸ Like transformation is bodhi, because there is no grasping or rejecting. Without confusion is bodhi, because it is constantly self-quiescent. Excellent quiescence is bodhi, because its nature is pure. Non-grasping is bodhi, because it is apart from clinging. Without difference is bodhi, because all dharmas are equal. Without comparison is bodhi, because there is nothing to which it can be compared. Subtle and wonderful is bodhi, because all dharmas are difficult to know.'¹⁹

"World-Honored One! When Vimalakirti expounded this Dharma, two hundred deva-sons attained the patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas.²⁰ Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

## Prabhāvyūha Declines

The Buddha addressed the youth Prabhāvyūha:²¹ "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

Prabhāvyūha addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, as I was leaving the great city of Vaiśālī, Vimalakirti was just entering the city. I immediately bowed in greeting and asked:

"'Elder, where are you coming from?'

"He answered: 'I am coming from the bodhimaṇḍa.'²²

"I asked: 'What is the bodhimaṇḍa?'

"He answered: 'An upright mind is the bodhimaṇḍa,²³ because it is free from falsehood. Generating practice is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it accomplishes tasks. A profound mind is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it increases merit. The bodhi-mind is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it is without error. Giving is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it does not seek reward. Upholding the precepts is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it fulfills vows. Patience is the bodhimaṇḍa, because the mind is unobstructed toward all sentient beings. Vigor is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it does not slacken or retreat. Meditation is the bodhimaṇḍa, because the mind is regulated and gentle. Wisdom is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it directly perceives all dharmas. Loving-kindness is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it is equal toward all sentient beings. Compassion is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it endures weariness and suffering. Sympathetic joy is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it delights in the Dharma. Equanimity is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it cuts off aversion and affection. Supernatural powers are the bodhimaṇḍa, because they accomplish the six penetrations. Liberation is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it can turn the back [on defilements].²⁴ Skillful means is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it teaches and transforms sentient beings. The four means of attraction are the bodhimaṇḍa, because they embrace sentient beings. Extensive learning is the bodhimaṇḍa, because one practices according to what one has heard. Controlling the mind is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it correctly contemplates all dharmas.²⁵ The thirty-seven factors of enlightenment are the bodhimaṇḍa, because they abandon conditioned dharmas. The truths²⁶ are the bodhimaṇḍa, because they do not deceive the world. Dependent origination is the bodhimaṇḍa, because ignorance up to old age and death are all without exhaustion.²⁷ The afflictions are the bodhimaṇḍa, because they are known as they truly are. Sentient beings are the bodhimaṇḍa, because they are known to be without self. All dharmas are the bodhimaṇḍa, because all dharmas are known to be empty. Conquering Māra is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it is not overturned. The three realms are the bodhimaṇḍa, because there is no destination. The lion's roar is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it is fearless. The powers, fearlessnesses, and unique qualities are the bodhimaṇḍa, because they are without faults. The three insights are the bodhimaṇḍa, because they are without remaining obstructions. In one thought-moment knowing all dharmas is the bodhimaṇḍa, because it accomplishes omniscience.²⁸

"'Thus, good son! If a bodhisattva teaches and transforms sentient beings in accordance with the pāramitās, whatever he does—raising his foot or lowering his foot—you should know all comes from the bodhimaṇḍa and abides in the Buddha-Dharma.'²⁹

"When he expounded this Dharma, five hundred deva-sons and humans all generated the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

## Jagatīṃdhara Declines

The Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Jagatīṃdhara:³⁰ "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

Jagatīṃdhara addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, I was staying in my quiet chamber. At that time, Māra Pāpīyas,³¹ accompanied by twelve thousand celestial maidens, appearing like Śakra, with drums and strings and songs, came to my place. With his retinue, he bowed with his head at my feet, joined his palms reverently, and stood to one side.

"I, thinking he was Śakra, said to him: 'Welcome, Kauśika!³² Although you deserve such merit, you should not be self-indulgent. You should contemplate the impermanence of the five desires and seek the wholesome root; regarding body, life, and wealth, you should cultivate the solid Dharma.'

"He immediately said to me: 'Righteous one! Receive these twelve thousand celestial maidens to be your attendants for sweeping and sprinkling.'

"I said: 'Kauśika! Do not present such non-Dharmic things to a son of the Śākya's śramaṇa.³³ This is not appropriate for me.'

"Before I had finished speaking, Vimalakirti came and said to me: 'This is not Śakra—this is Māra, come to disturb you!'

"He immediately addressed Māra: 'These women can be given to me—I am one who should accept them.'

"Māra was immediately alarmed, thinking: 'Will Vimalakirti harm me?' He wished to hide his form and leave, but he could not hide. Exhausting all his supernatural powers, he still could not leave. Then he heard a voice from the sky saying: 'Pāpīyas! Give the women to him, and only then can you leave.'

"Māra, because of his fear, reluctantly gave them.

"At that time, Vimalakirti addressed the women: 'Māra has given you to me. Now you should all generate the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*.³⁴'

"He then expounded the Dharma to them according to their capacities, causing them to generate the aspiration for the Way. He further said: 'You have already generated the aspiration for the Way. You have Dharma-joy with which to enjoy yourselves—you should no longer take pleasure in the five desires.'³⁵

"The celestial maidens immediately asked: 'What is Dharma-joy?'

"He answered: 'Joy is constantly having faith in the Buddha. Joy is wishing to hear the Dharma. Joy is making offerings to the assembly. Joy is being apart from the five desires. Joy is viewing the five aggregates as enemies. Joy is viewing the four great elements as venomous snakes. Joy is viewing the internal sense-bases as empty villages.³⁶ Joy is following and protecting the aspiration for the Way. Joy is benefiting sentient beings. Joy is honoring and serving the teacher. Joy is extensively practicing giving. Joy is firmly upholding the precepts. Joy is patience and gentleness. Joy is diligently gathering the roots of goodness. Joy is meditative concentration without confusion. Joy is wisdom apart from defilements. Joy is widely generating the bodhi-mind. Joy is conquering the māras. Joy is cutting off the afflictions. Joy is purifying the buddha-lands. Joy is accomplishing the marks and excellent characteristics, thereby cultivating all merits. Joy is adorning the bodhimaṇḍa. Joy is hearing the profound Dharma without fear. Joy is the three gates of liberation³⁷ without delighting in inopportune times. Joy is being close to those who study the same Dharma. Joy is having no resentful obstruction in the mind toward those who do not study the same Dharma.³⁸ Joy is supporting evil friends. Joy is drawing close to good friends.³⁹ Joy is joyful purity of mind. Joy is cultivating immeasurable practice-methods of the Way. This is the Dharma-joy of bodhisattvas.'

"At that time, Pāpīyas addressed the women: 'I wish to return with you to the heavenly palace.'

"The women said: 'Since you have given us to this elder, we have Dharma-joy and are very joyful. We no longer take pleasure in the five desires.'

"Māra said: 'Elder, can you release these women? To give away all one has to others—this is the bodhisattva.'

"Vimalakirti said: 'I have already released them! You may take them. Let all sentient beings' Dharma-aspirations be fulfilled.'⁴⁰

"Thereupon the women asked Vimalakirti: 'How should we abide in Māra's palace?'

"Vimalakirti said: 'Sisters! There is a Dharma-gate called the Inexhaustible Lamp.⁴¹ You should learn it. The Inexhaustible Lamp is like a single lamp lighting a hundred thousand lamps—the dark all become bright, and the brightness is never exhausted.

"'Thus, sisters! A single bodhisattva guides and opens a hundred thousand sentient beings, causing them to generate the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*—their aspiration for the Way is also never extinguished. According to what they teach, they increase all wholesome dharmas in themselves. This is called the Inexhaustible Lamp.

"'Although you abide in Māra's palace, with this Inexhaustible Lamp, cause innumerable deva-sons and deva-daughters to generate the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. This will repay the Buddha's kindness and will also greatly benefit all sentient beings.'

"Then the celestial maidens bowed with their heads at Vimalakirti's feet and followed Māra back to the palace, suddenly disappearing.

"World-Honored One! Vimalakirti has such autonomous supernatural power and wisely eloquent speech. Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

---

## Sudhana Declines

The Buddha addressed the elder's son Sudhana:⁴² "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

Sudhana addressed the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness. Why is this so? I remember once in the past, in my father's house I held a great donation ceremony,⁴³ making offerings to all śramaṇas and brahmins, as well as various non-Buddhist teachers, the poor, the lowly, the orphaned and solitary, and beggars. After the full seven-day period, Vimalakirti came and entered the assembly. He said to me:

"'Son of an elder! A great donation ceremony should not be held as you are holding it. You should hold a Dharma-giving ceremony.⁴⁴ What is the use of a wealth-giving ceremony?'

"I said: 'Elder! What is a Dharma-giving ceremony?'

"He answered: 'A Dharma-giving ceremony is one in which, without before or after, one simultaneously makes offerings to all sentient beings.⁴⁵ This is called a Dharma-giving ceremony.'

"I said: 'What does this mean?'

"'It means: Using bodhi to arouse the mind of loving-kindness.⁴⁶ Using saving sentient beings to arouse the mind of great compassion. Using upholding the true Dharma to arouse the mind of sympathetic joy. Using gathering wisdom to practice equanimity. Using gathering up stinginess and greed to arouse the pāramitā of giving. Using transforming those who violate the precepts to arouse the pāramitā of morality. Using the teaching of non-self to arouse the pāramitā of patience. Using departing from the characteristics of body and mind to arouse the pāramitā of vigor. Using the characteristic of bodhi to arouse the pāramitā of meditation. Using omniscience to arouse the pāramitā of wisdom.

"'Teaching and transforming sentient beings, yet arising emptiness. Not abandoning conditioned dharmas, yet arising signlessness. Manifesting being born, yet arising wishlessness. Protecting and upholding the true Dharma, arising the power of skillful means. Using liberating sentient beings to arise the four means of attraction. Using honoring all beings to arise the elimination of pride. Regarding body, life, and wealth, arising the three solid dharmas.⁴⁷ In the six recollections, arising the method of thought.⁴⁸ In the six harmonies and reverence, arising straightforward mind.⁴⁹ Correctly practicing wholesome dharmas, arising pure livelihood. With a pure and joyful mind, arising closeness to noble sages. Without hating evil people, arising a regulated mind. With the dharma of leaving home, arising a profound mind. With practicing as one says, arising extensive learning. With the teaching of non-contention, arising solitude. Tending toward the Buddha's wisdom, arising seated meditation. Liberating the bonds of sentient beings, arising stages of practice. With accomplishing the marks and excellent characteristics, and purifying the buddha-lands, arising meritorious karma. Knowing all sentient beings' thoughts and teaching the Dharma accordingly, arising knowledge-karma. Knowing all dharmas without grasping or rejecting and entering the single-characteristic gate, arising wisdom-karma.⁵⁰ Cutting off all afflictions, all obstacles, and all unwholesome dharmas, arising all wholesome karma. Attaining all wisdom and all wholesome dharmas, arising all practices that assist the Buddha-Way.

"'Thus, good son! This is a Dharma-giving ceremony. If a bodhisattva abides in this Dharma-giving ceremony, he is a great donor and also a field of merit for all the world.'⁵¹

"World-Honored One! When Vimalakirti expounded this Dharma, among the brahmin assembly, two hundred people all generated the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. At that time, my mind attained purity. I sighed at the unprecedented experience! I bowed with my head at Vimalakirti's feet and immediately removed my necklace worth a hundred thousand [coins] to offer him, but he refused to accept it.

"I said: 'Elder! Please accept it and give it as you wish.'

"Vimalakirti then accepted the necklace and divided it into two parts. He gave one part to the lowest beggar in the assembly and offered one part to the Tathāgata Duṣprasaha.⁵² The entire assembly saw the Radiant Land of the Tathāgata Duṣprasaha, and they also saw the pearl necklace on that buddha transforming into a four-pillared jeweled platform, magnificently adorned on all four sides without obstructing one another.

"When Vimalakirti had manifested this spiritual transformation, he said: 'If a donor gives with an equal mind to the lowest beggar, this is the same as the field of merit of the Tathāgata—without any discrimination, equal in great compassion, not seeking any reward. This is called the complete Dharma-giving.'⁵³

"When the lowest beggar in the city saw this spiritual power and heard his words, all generated the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. Therefore I am not capable of going to inquire about his illness."

---

## Conclusion

Thus did all the bodhisattvas each explain to the Buddha the account of their own past encounter, describing what Vimalakirti had said, and all declared they were not capable of going to inquire about his illness.

### Footnotes

¹ **[Textual]** Maitreya (彌勒, *Maitreya*). The future buddha, currently a bodhisattva awaiting birth. His teaching was on the stage of non-retrogression, making him the natural first choice among bodhisattvas.

² **[Philosophical]** Stage of non-retrogression (不退轉地, *avaivartika-bhūmi*). The stage from which a bodhisattva cannot fall back. Vimalakirti challenges the very concept of prediction and attainment.

³ **[Philosophical]** One-lifetime prediction. The prophecy that in Maitreya's next life he will become a buddha. This is his defining characteristic.

⁴ **[Philosophical]** Present does not abide (現在生無住). The present moment is too fleeting to ground any prediction—it is already gone before it can be grasped.

⁵ **[Philosophical]** In this moment also being born, aging, dying. A quote from the Buddha, emphasizing radical momentariness—birth, aging, and death all occur in each instant.

⁶ **[Philosophical]** Non-arising (無生, *anutpāda*). The realization that phenomena do not truly arise.

⁷ **[Philosophical]** Ultimate position (正位). The state beyond arising and ceasing; but if there, where is prediction?

⁸ **[Philosophical]** Thusness arising/ceasing (如生如滅). Thusness (*tathatā*) neither arises nor ceases—so prediction cannot be based on it.

⁹ **[Philosophical]** All sentient beings are thusness. Since everything is thusness, and thusness is non-dual, if Maitreya is predicted, all are predicted.

¹⁰ **[Philosophical]** Non-dual and non-different (不二不異). The heart of the Vimalakirti Sutra's teaching.

¹¹ **[Philosophical]** All sentient beings are the characteristic of bodhi. **KEY DOCTRINE**: Enlightenment is not something added to beings—it is their very nature.

¹² **[Philosophical]** No further extinction to undergo. Beings are already in nirvāṇa in their ultimate nature—there is no second extinction.

¹³ **[Philosophical]** Cannot be attained by body or mind. Bodhi transcends psychophysical existence.

¹⁴ **[Philosophical]** Obstruction is bodhi. A paradox: bodhi obstructs all goals because there is nothing to achieve.

¹⁵ **[Philosophical]** True limit (實際, *bhūta-koṭi*). The absolute boundary of reality.

¹⁶ **[Philosophical]** Apart from mind and mental objects (離意法). Beyond subject-object duality.

¹⁷ **[Philosophical]** Sense-bases do not meet. The ordinary model of cognition (sense meeting object) is deconstructed.

¹⁸ **[Philosophical]** Provisional name. **KEY THEME**: "Bodhi" is just a word—names have no inherent reality.

¹⁹ **[Philosophical]** All dharmas are difficult to know. This conclusion emphasizes the ineffability of awakening.

²⁰ **[Philosophical]** Patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas. A very high attainment resulting from this teaching.

²¹ **[Textual]** Prabhāvyūha (光嚴童子, *Prabhāvyūha*). "Splendid Light Youth." A bodhisattva.

²² **[Philosophical]** Bodhimaṇḍa (道場). Literally "place of enlightenment"—the spot where a buddha attains awakening. Vimalakirti radically redefines it.

²³ **[Philosophical]** **KEY TEACHING**: Every quality is the bodhimaṇḍa. This extensive list transforms the bodhimaṇḍa from a physical location to the entire field of spiritual practice.

²⁴ **[Philosophical]** Can turn the back. Liberation enables one to turn away from defilements.

²⁵ **[Philosophical]** Controlling the mind. The foundational practice.

²⁶ **[Textual]** The truths (諦). The Four Noble Truths.

²⁷ **[Philosophical]** Without exhaustion. Even the twelve links of dependent origination are understood non-dually—they neither terminate nor are they eternal.

²⁸ **[Philosophical]** Omniscience (一切智, *sarvajñatā*). The knowing that encompasses all dharmas in a single moment.

²⁹ **[Philosophical]** **REVOLUTIONARY TEACHING**: Every action comes from the bodhimaṇḍa. The awakening-place is not somewhere else—it is here, in every step.

³⁰ **[Textual]** Jagatīṃdhara (持世, *Jagatīṃdhara*). "Upholder of the World." A bodhisattva.

³¹ **[Textual]** Māra Pāpīyas (魔波旬). The evil one, the tempter.

³² **[Textual]** Kauśika (憍尸迦). A name for Śakra/Indra.

³³ **[Textual]** Śākya's śramaṇa. A Buddhist monk, follower of the Śākyan sage.

³⁴ **[Philosophical]** Vimalakirti teaches even Māra's women. This radical inclusivity shows the reach of skillful means.

³⁵ **[Philosophical]** Dharma-joy vs. five desires. Spiritual happiness replaces sensual pleasure.

³⁶ **[Philosophical]** Five aggregates as enemies, four elements as snakes, sense-bases as empty villages. Classic analogies for disenchantment with the body and world.

### Key Concepts

**Deconstruction of Prediction and Attainment**: Maitreya's encounter shows that even the most exalted Buddhist concepts—like receiving prediction from a buddha—are empty of inherent existence. There is no moment in which prediction occurs, no real distinction between Maitreya and all beings.

**The Bodhimaṇḍa Redefined**: Prabhāvyūha's encounter transforms the "place of enlightenment" from the Bodh Gaya site into every practice, every quality, every moment. Enlightenment is not somewhere else.

**The Inexhaustible Lamp**: This teaching to Māra's women is one of the sutra's most famous passages. Liberation is not diminished by being shared—it increases. Each awakened being ignites others.

**Dharma-Giving vs. Wealth-Giving**: Sudhana's encounter contrasts external generosity with the deeper gift of liberation. True giving crosses all barriers simultaneously.

# Chapter 5: Manjuśrī Inquires About the Illness

## 文殊師利問疾品第五

*Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel*

---

## The Buddha's Commission

At that time, the Buddha addressed Manjuśrī: "Go and visit Vimalakīrti to inquire about his illness."

Manjuśrī said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! That superior person is difficult to respond to in dialogue. He has deeply penetrated the true nature of reality (*bhūtatathatā*), is skilled in expounding the essentials of the Dharma, possesses unobstructed eloquence, and has wisdom without impediment. He knows all the methods of the bodhisattvas and has entered into all the secret treasures of the Buddhas. He has subdued the hosts of Māra, plays freely with supernatural powers, and has perfected both wisdom and skillful means. Nevertheless, I shall accept the Buddha's sacred directive and go to inquire about his illness."

---

## The Great Assembly Follows

At that moment, all the bodhisattvas, great disciples, Śakra, Brahmā, and the Four Heavenly Kings[^1] in the assembly thought: "Now these two great beings—Manjuśrī and Vimalakīrti—will converse together, and they will surely expound the wonderful Dharma!" At once, eight thousand bodhisattvas, five hundred śrāvakas, and hundreds of thousands of gods and humans all wished to follow.

Thus Manjuśrī, together with the bodhisattvas, the assembly of great disciples, and the gods and humans, respectfully surrounded him and entered the great city of Vaiśālī.

[^1]: The Four Heavenly Kings (*Caturmahārāja*) are the guardian deities of the four cardinal directions who protect the world from evil influences.

---

## Vimalakīrti Prepares His Chamber

At that time, the elder Vimalakīrti thought to himself: "Now Manjuśrī is coming with a great assembly!" Immediately, through his supernatural power, he emptied his chamber, removing all furnishings and attendants, leaving only a single bed upon which he lay ill.

---

## The Greeting of Non-Coming

When Manjuśrī entered his dwelling and saw the chamber empty, with nothing whatsoever, and Vimalakīrti reclining alone on a single bed, Vimalakīrti said: "Welcome, Manjuśrī! You come with the mark of not-coming; you see with the mark of not-seeing."[^2]

Manjuśrī replied: "Just so, householder! If one has already come, one does not come again; if one has already gone, one does not go again. Why is this? One who comes has nowhere from which they come; one who goes has nowhere to which they go. What can be seen can no longer be seen. But let us set this matter aside. Householder! Is this illness bearable? Is the treatment diminishing it rather than increasing it? The World-Honored One sends his earnest regards and inquires without measure. Householder! What is the cause of this illness? How long has it persisted? How may it be extinguished?"

[^2]: This famous exchange establishes the non-dual philosophy that permeates the sutra. "Coming" and "seeing" are conventional appearances without ultimate reality—the enlightened one moves through the world without the marks of motion or perception.

---

## The Illness of Great Compassion

Vimalakīrti said: "From ignorance (*avidyā*) arises craving (*tṛṣṇā*), and thus my illness arises. Because all sentient beings are ill, therefore I am ill. If the illness of all sentient beings were extinguished, then my illness would be extinguished. Why is this? The bodhisattva enters birth-and-death (*saṃsāra*) for the sake of sentient beings; having birth-and-death, there is illness. If sentient beings could be freed from illness, then the bodhisattva would have no more illness.

"It is like a wealthy man who has an only child. When that child becomes ill, the father and mother also become ill. If the child recovers, the father and mother also recover. The bodhisattva is like this—loving all sentient beings as their own children. When sentient beings are ill, the bodhisattva is ill; when sentient beings recover, the bodhisattva also recovers.

"You also asked, 'What is the cause of this illness?' The bodhisattva's illness arises from great compassion (*mahākaruṇā*)."[^3]

[^3]: This is the central soteriological principle of the chapter: the bodhisattva's illness is not personal karma but the manifestation of compassionate identification with all suffering beings. This "illness of compassion" (*karuṇā-vyādhi*) is a skillful means for teaching.

---

## The Emptiness of the Chamber

Manjuśrī asked: "Householder! Why is this chamber empty, without attendants?"

Vimalakīrti replied: "All buddha-lands are also empty."

"What makes them empty?"

"They are empty by emptiness."

"What is the use of empty emptiness?"

"They are empty because of non-discriminating emptiness."

"Can emptiness be discriminated?"

"Discrimination itself is also empty."

"Where should emptiness be sought?"

"It should be sought within the sixty-two views."[^4]

"Where should the sixty-two views be sought?"

"They should be sought within the liberation of all buddhas."

"Where should the liberation of all buddhas be sought?"

"It should be sought within the mental activities of all sentient beings.

"You also asked, 'Why are there no attendants?' All māras and all non-Buddhist practitioners are my attendants. Why is this? The māras delight in birth-and-death, and the bodhisattva does not abandon birth-and-death. The non-Buddhists delight in various views, and the bodhisattva is unmoved by various views."

[^4]: The sixty-two views (*dvāṣaṣṭhi-dṛṣṭi*) are the classical enumeration of wrong philosophical positions, including eternalism, nihilism, and their variations.

---

## The Nature of the Illness

Manjuśrī asked: "Householder! What is the characteristic of this illness?"

Vimalakīrti replied: "My illness has no form and cannot be seen."

"Is this illness united with the body or united with the mind?"

"It is not united with the body, because bodily characteristics are transcended. It is also not united with the mind, because the mind is like an illusion."

"Among the four great elements—earth, water, fire, and wind—which element's illness is this?"

"This illness is not of the earth element, yet it does not leave the earth element. Water, fire, and wind are likewise. Yet the illness of sentient beings arises from the four elements; because they have illness, therefore I have illness."

---

## How to Console an Ill Bodhisattva

At that time, Manjuśrī asked Vimalakīrti: "How should a bodhisattva console another bodhisattva who is ill?"

Vimalakīrti replied: "Speak of the impermanence of the body, but do not speak of weariness and disgust for the body. Speak of the body's suffering, but do not speak of delight in nirvāṇa. Speak of the non-self of the body, while teaching and guiding sentient beings. Speak of the body's empty tranquility, but do not speak of ultimate extinction. Speak of repenting past transgressions, but do not speak of entering the past.

"Through one's own illness, have compassion for the illness of others. Recognize the suffering of countless past lives, and think of benefiting all sentient beings. Remember the merit cultivated, contemplate a pure livelihood, and do not give rise to anxiety or distress. Always arouse vigor. Become a king of physicians, healing all diseases. This is how a bodhisattva should console an ill bodhisattva and cause them to rejoice."

---

## How to Discipline the Mind

Manjuśrī asked: "Householder! How should an ill bodhisattva discipline their mind?"

Vimalakīrti replied: "An ill bodhisattva should reflect thus: 'This present illness of mine arises entirely from the confused thoughts and afflictions of past lives. There is no real dharma—who is the one who receives illness? Why is this? The four great elements combine and are conventionally called a body; the four elements have no master, and the body also has no self.

"'Moreover, this illness arises entirely from attachment to a self. Therefore, one should not give rise to attachment to a self.' Having understood the root of illness, one should abandon the notion of self and the notion of sentient beings.

"One should give rise to the notion of dharma and reflect thus: 'This body is merely a combination of dharmas. When arising, only dharmas arise; when ceasing, only dharmas cease. Moreover, these dharmas do not know each other—when arising, they do not say "I arise"; when ceasing, they do not say "I cease."'

"That ill bodhisattva, to extinguish the notion of dharma, should further reflect: 'This notion of dharma is also a confused thought. Confused thought is the great affliction; I should abandon it.' How to abandon it? Abandon self and what belongs to self. How to abandon self and what belongs to self? Abandon the two dharmas. How to abandon the two dharmas? Do not think of internal or external, and practice equality among all dharmas.

"What is equality? It is the equality of self and nirvāṇa. Why is this? Self and nirvāṇa are both empty. Why are they empty? They are empty merely as names. These two dharmas have no fixed nature; attaining this equality, there is no other illness—there is only the illness of emptiness. And the illness of emptiness is also empty.

"This ill bodhisattva, by not receiving yet receiving all experiences, and having not yet completed the buddha-dharma, does not extinguish experience to attain realization."[^5]

[^5]: This passage articulates the Middle Way between attachment and extinction. The bodhisattva neither grasps experiences nor prematurely extinguishes them, maintaining engagement with saṃsāra for the benefit of beings.

---

## The True Bodhisattva Practice

"If the body experiences suffering, one should think of beings in the evil destinies and give rise to great compassion. 'I have already tamed myself; I should also tame all sentient beings.' One should only remove their illness while not removing the dharma, and teach them to cut off the root of illness.

"What is the root of illness? It is grasping (*upādāna*). From grasping comes the root of illness. What is grasped? The three realms. How to cut off grasping? Through non-attainment. If there is nothing to attain, then there is no grasping. What is meant by non-attainment? Abandoning the two views. What are the two views? Internal views and external views. This is non-attainment.

"Manjuśrī! This is how an ill bodhisattva disciplines their mind—to cut off the suffering of old age, illness, and death. This is the bodhisattva's awakening. If it is not like this, one's cultivation has no benefit of wisdom. Just as defeating enemies can be called courage, likewise one who can also remove old age, illness, and death—this is what is meant by 'bodhisattva.'"

---

## Beyond Love-View Compassion

"That ill bodhisattva should further reflect: 'Just as my illness is neither true nor existent, the illness of sentient beings is also neither true nor existent.' When making this observation, if toward sentient beings there arises love-view great compassion (*sneha-dṛṣṭi-mahākaruṇā*), one should immediately abandon it. Why is this?

"The bodhisattva eradicates the afflictions that are adventitious defilements and then gives rise to great compassion. Love-view compassion leads to weariness in the cycle of birth-and-death. If one can leave this behind, there is no weariness. Wherever one is reborn, one is not covered by love-views. Being unbound in rebirth, one can expound the Dharma for sentient beings to liberate their bonds.

"As the Buddha has said: 'If one is bound oneself and can liberate others' bonds—there is no such thing. If one is not bound oneself and can liberate others' bonds—this is possible.'

"Therefore the bodhisattva should not give rise to bondage. What is bondage? What is liberation? Attachment to the taste of meditation (*dhyāna-rasa*) is the bodhisattva's bondage; arising through skillful means is the bodhisattva's liberation.

"Again: wisdom without skillful means is bondage; wisdom with skillful means is liberation. Skillful means without wisdom is bondage; skillful means with wisdom is liberation.

"What is wisdom without skillful means as bondage? It is when a bodhisattva adorns buddha-lands and accomplishes sentient beings with a mind of love-views, and disciplines themselves in the dharmas of emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness—this is called wisdom without skillful means as bondage.

"What is wisdom with skillful means as liberation? It is when one adorns buddha-lands and accomplishes sentient beings without a mind of love-views, and disciplines oneself in the dharmas of emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness without weariness—this is called wisdom with skillful means as liberation.

"What is skillful means without wisdom as bondage? It is when a bodhisattva dwells in desire, anger, wrong views, and other afflictions while planting roots of virtue—this is called skillful means without wisdom as bondage.

"What is skillful means with wisdom as liberation? It is when one departs from desire, anger, wrong views, and other afflictions while planting roots of virtue and dedicating them to *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*—this is called skillful means with wisdom as liberation.

"Manjuśrī! That ill bodhisattva should observe all dharmas thus. Moreover, one should observe the body as impermanent, suffering, empty, and non-self—this is called wisdom. Although the body is ill, constantly remaining in birth-and-death to benefit all while not becoming weary—this is called skillful means.

"Moreover, observing the body: the body does not leave illness, and illness does not leave the body; this illness is this body, neither new nor old—this is called wisdom. Though the body is ill, not permanently extinguishing it—this is called skillful means."

---

## The Non-Abiding Bodhisattva Practice

"Manjuśrī! An ill bodhisattva should discipline their mind in this way: neither abiding in it, nor abiding in an undisciplined mind. Why is this? If one abides in an undisciplined mind, this is the dharma of the ignorant. If one abides in a disciplined mind, this is the dharma of the śrāvaka. Therefore the bodhisattva should not abide in either discipline or non-discipline. Leaving these two dharmas is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Being in birth-and-death without being defiled by its practices; abiding in nirvāṇa without being permanently extinguished—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Neither the practice of ordinary beings nor the practice of sages—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Neither defiled practice nor pure practice—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Though surpassing māra's practice, yet manifesting the subduing of māras—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Seeking all-knowledge without seeking it at the wrong time—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though observing that dharmas are unborn, yet not entering the fixed position of cessation—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Though observing the twelve links of dependent origination, yet entering into all wrong views—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though gathering in all sentient beings, yet without attachment—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though delighting in seclusion, yet not relying on the exhaustion of body and mind—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Though practicing in the three realms, yet not damaging the nature of dharmas—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though practicing emptiness, yet planting roots of virtue—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though practicing signlessness, yet liberating sentient beings—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though practicing wishlessness, yet manifesting receiving a body—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Though practicing non-arising, yet arising in all good practices—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though practicing the six perfections, yet fully knowing the mental states of sentient beings—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though practicing the six supernatural powers, yet not exhausting the outflows—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Though practicing the four immeasurables, yet not craving to be born in the Brahma world—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though practicing meditation, liberation, and samādhi, yet not being reborn according to meditation—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Though practicing the four foundations of mindfulness, yet not permanently leaving body, sensation, mind, and dharmas—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though practicing the four right efforts, yet not abandoning the vigor of body and mind—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though practicing the four bases of supernatural power, yet attaining mastery of supernatural powers—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Though practicing the five faculties, yet discerning the sharp and dull faculties of sentient beings—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though practicing the five powers, yet delighting in seeking the ten powers of a Buddha—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though practicing the seven factors of awakening, yet discerning the wisdom of a Buddha—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Though practicing the Noble Eightfold Path, yet delighting in practicing the immeasurable Buddha-path—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though practicing calming and insight as aids to the path, yet not ultimately falling into extinction—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Though practicing the non-arising and non-ceasing of dharmas, yet adorning the body with the marks and signs—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though manifesting the deportment of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, yet not abandoning the Buddha-dharma—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Though following the ultimately pure characteristics of dharmas, yet manifesting a body according to what is appropriate—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Though observing that the lands of all buddhas are eternally still like space, yet manifesting various pure buddha-lands—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Though attaining the Buddha-path, turning the Dharma wheel, and entering nirvāṇa, yet not abandoning the bodhisattva path—this is the bodhisattva's practice."

## The Assembly's Awakening

When these words were spoken, eight thousand gods in the great assembly brought by Manjuśrī all aroused the aspiration for *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*.

---

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Key Philosophical Concepts

1. **Non-Dual Coming/Seeing**: The opening exchange establishes the epistemological framework—conventional appearances of motion and perception are empty of inherent existence (*svabhāva-śūnya*).

2. **Compassionate Illness**: The bodhisattva's illness is not karmic retribution but the natural expression of identification with suffering beings—a soteriological device rather than a personal condition.

3. **Emptiness Dialogues**: The rapid-fire exchange about emptiness demonstrates the Mādhyamika method of deconstructing all fixed categories, including the category of emptiness itself.

4. **Wisdom and Skillful Means**: The dialectic between *prajñā* (wisdom) and *upāya* (skillful means) establishes that neither alone is sufficient—only their union constitutes true liberation.

5. **Neither-Nor Practice**: The extended list of "though...yet..." formulations articulates the distinctive bodhisattva path that transcends both worldly attachment and premature cessation.

### Cross-References

- For the concept of compassionate identification with suffering, see Chapter 2 (Skillful Means) on Vimalakīrti's illness as teaching device
- The sixty-two views are elaborated in the Brahmajāla Sutta (Dīgha Nikāya 1)

# Chapter 5: Manjushri Inquires About the Illness (文殊師利問疾品)

**Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel**

---

## The Buddha's Command

At that time, the Buddha addressed Mañjuśrī:¹ "Go to Vimalakirti and inquire about his illness."

Mañjuśrī said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! That superior person is difficult to respond to in debate.² He has deeply penetrated to the true aspect of reality,³ is skilled in expounding the essentials of the Dharma, and his eloquence flows without obstruction. His wisdom knows no impediment. He is thoroughly acquainted with all the methods of the bodhisattvas⁴ and has entered into the secret treasures of all buddhas. He has subdued the hosts of Māra and sports freely with spiritual powers.⁵ His wisdom and skillful means have both reached perfection. Nevertheless, I shall accept the Buddha's sagely command and go to inquire about his illness."

---

## The Great Assembly

Thereupon, the bodhisattvas, great disciples, Śakra, Brahmā, and the Four Heavenly Kings⁶ in the assembly all thought: "Now these two great beings—Mañjuśrī and Vimalakirti—will converse together.⁷ They will certainly expound the wondrous Dharma!" 

Immediately, eight thousand bodhisattvas, five hundred śrāvakas, and hundreds of thousands of devas and humans all wished to follow along.

Thus, Mañjuśrī, together with the bodhisattvas, great disciples, and the devas and humans, respectfully surrounded him as they entered the great city of Vaiśālī.

---

## Vimalakirti's Empty Room

At that time, the elder Vimalakirti thought to himself: "Now Mañjuśrī is coming with the great assembly!" Immediately, through his spiritual powers, he made his room empty,⁸ removing all furnishings and attendants. He placed only a single bed and lay upon it, feigning illness.

When Mañjuśrī entered his dwelling, he saw the room was empty, with nothing at all in it, and Vimalakirti lay alone on a single bed. At that time, Vimalakirti said: "Welcome, Mañjuśrī! You come with the mark of not-coming;⁹ you appear with the mark of not-appearing."

Mañjuśrī said: "Just so, householder! If one has already come, one does not come again; if one has already gone, one does not go again. Why is this? One who comes has nowhere from which they come; one who goes has no place to which they go. That which can be seen cannot be seen again.¹⁰ But let us set aside this matter. Householder! Can this illness be endured? Has the treatment brought improvement rather than increase? The World-Honored One earnestly sends his infinite inquiries. Householder! From what cause does this illness arise? How long has it persisted? How may it be extinguished?"

---

## The Illness of the Bodhisattva

Vimalakirti said: "From ignorance arises craving, and thus my illness arises.¹¹ Because all sentient beings are ill, therefore I am ill. If the illness of all sentient beings were extinguished, then my illness would be extinguished. Why is this? The bodhisattva enters birth-and-death for the sake of sentient beings.¹² Where there is birth-and-death, there is illness. If sentient beings were freed from illness, then the bodhisattva would have no illness.

"It is like a wealthy householder who has only one child.¹³ When the child becomes ill, the parents also become ill. When the child recovers, the parents also recover. The bodhisattva is likewise: for all sentient beings, he loves them as his children. When sentient beings are ill, the bodhisattva is ill; when sentient beings recover, the bodhisattva also recovers.

"You asked, 'From what cause does this illness arise?' The illness of the bodhisattva arises from great compassion."¹⁴

---

## The Dialogue on Emptiness

Mañjuśrī said: "Householder! Why is this room empty of attendants?"

Vimalakirti said: "All buddha-lands are likewise empty."¹⁵

Again he asked: "By what is it empty?"

He answered: "It is empty by emptiness."¹⁶

Again he asked: "What use is emptiness?"

He answered: "It is empty because of non-discriminating emptiness."

Again he asked: "Can emptiness be discriminated?"

He answered: "Discrimination is also empty."

Again he asked: "Where should emptiness be sought?"

He answered: "It should be sought among the sixty-two views."¹⁷

Again he asked: "Where should the sixty-two views be sought?"

He answered: "They should be sought in the liberation of all buddhas."

Again he asked: "Where should the liberation of all buddhas be sought?"

He answered: "It should be sought in the mental activities of all sentient beings.¹⁸

"Furthermore, you asked, 'Why are there no attendants?' All māras and all non-Buddhists are my attendants.¹⁹ Why is this? The māras delight in birth-and-death, but the bodhisattva does not abandon birth-and-death. The non-Buddhists delight in various views, but the bodhisattva is not moved by various views."

---

## The Nature of the Illness

Mañjuśrī said: "Householder! What is the nature of your illness?"

Vimalakirti said: "My illness has no form and cannot be seen."²⁰

Again he asked: "Is this illness united with the body? Or with the mind?"

He answered: "It is not united with the body, because the characteristic of the body is separation.²¹ Nor is it united with the mind, because the mind is like an illusion."

Again he asked: "Of the four great elements—earth, water, fire, and wind—which element's illness is this?"

He answered: "This illness is not the earth element, yet it does not leave the earth element. Water, fire, and wind are likewise. Yet the illnesses of sentient beings arise from the four great elements.²² Because they have illness, therefore I have illness."

---

## Consoling the Sick Bodhisattva

At that time, Mañjuśrī asked Vimalakirti: "How should a bodhisattva console a bodhisattva who is ill?"

Vimalakirti said: "Speak of the body's impermanence, but do not speak of weariness with the body.²³ Speak of the body's suffering, but do not speak of delighting in nirvāṇa. Speak of the body's non-self, yet speak of guiding sentient beings. Speak of the body's emptiness and tranquility, but do not speak of ultimate extinction.²⁴

"Speak of repenting former transgressions, but do not speak of entering into the past. Through one's own illness, have compassion for the illness of others. One should recognize the suffering throughout countless past lives. One should be mindful of benefiting all sentient beings. Remember the merit previously cultivated. Be mindful of pure livelihood. Do not give rise to grief or distress, but constantly arouse vigor.²⁵

"One should become a king of physicians and heal all illnesses. Thus should a bodhisattva console a sick bodhisattva and cause them to rejoice."

---

## Subduing the Mind

Mañjuśrī said: "Householder! How should an ill bodhisattva subdue their mind?"

Vimalakirti said: "An ill bodhisattva should reflect thus:²⁶ 'This present illness of mine arises entirely from the inverted delusions and afflictions of past lives. There is no real dharma—who is it that receives illness? Why is this? The four great elements combine and are provisionally named a body.²⁷ The four great elements have no master; the body likewise has no self.

"'Furthermore, this illness arises entirely from attachment to self. Therefore, one should not generate attachment to self.' Having understood the root of illness, one should eliminate the notion of self and the notion of sentient beings.²⁸ One should give rise to the notion of dharmas, reflecting thus: 'This body is merely a combination of dharmas. When it arises, only dharmas arise; when it ceases, only dharmas cease. These dharmas do not know one another. When arising, they do not say "I arise"; when ceasing, they do not say "I cease."'

"To eliminate the notion of dharmas, that ill bodhisattva should reflect thus: 'This notion of dharmas is also inverted. Inversion is a great affliction; I should separate from it.'²⁹ What is meant by separation? Separation from self and what belongs to self. What is meant by separation from self and what belongs to self? Separation from the two dharmas.³⁰ What is meant by separation from the two dharmas? Not thinking of internal and external dharmas, but practicing equality. What is meant by equality? Equality of self and equality of nirvāṇa.³¹ Why is this? Self and nirvāṇa—both are empty. By what are they empty? They are empty only as names.³²

"Thus these two dharmas have no fixed nature. Attaining this equality, there is no other illness—only the illness of emptiness. The illness of emptiness is also empty. This ill bodhisattva, with nothing to receive, yet receives all receptions. Not yet having completed buddha-dharmas, one does not extinguish reception to take up realization.³³

---

## Wisdom and Skillful Means

"If the body has suffering, contemplate beings in the evil realms and arouse great compassion.³⁴ Having subdued myself, I should likewise subdue all sentient beings. Simply eliminate their illness, but do not eliminate the dharma.³⁵ To cut off the root of illness, teach and guide them. What is called the root of illness? Craving and attachment. From craving and attachment comes the root of illness. What is craved and attached to? The three realms.³⁶ How does one cut off craving and attachment? Through non-attainment.³⁷ If there is non-attainment, then there is no craving and attachment. What is meant by non-attainment? Separation from the two views—what are the two views? The internal view and the external view.³⁸ This is non-attainment.

"Mañjuśrī! This is how an ill bodhisattva subdues their mind, cutting off the suffering of old age, illness, and death. This indeed is the bodhisattva's awakening.³⁹ If it is not thus, whatever practice and cultivation one engages in will lack the benefit of wisdom. It is like vanquishing an enemy—only then can one be called courageous.⁴⁰ Likewise, one who completely eliminates old age, illness, and death—this is what is called a bodhisattva.

---

## Bondage and Liberation

"That ill bodhisattva should further reflect thus: 'This illness of mine is neither real nor existent; the illness of sentient beings is likewise neither real nor existent.'⁴¹ Contemplating thus, if toward sentient beings one arouses great compassion based on craving and views, one should immediately abandon it. Why is this? The bodhisattva eliminates the adventitious dust of afflictions and arouses great compassion.⁴² Compassion based on craving and views gives rise to weariness in birth-and-death. If one can separate from this, there is no weariness. In every place of rebirth, one is not covered by craving and views. Birth is without bondage; one can expound the Dharma for sentient beings and unfasten their bondage.

"As the Buddha has said: 'If one is bound oneself, to seek to unbind others—this is impossible. If one is unbound oneself, to unbind others—this is possible.'⁴³ Therefore, the bodhisattva should not arouse bondage.

"What is bondage? What is liberation? Attachment to the taste of meditation—this is the bodhisattva's bondage.⁴⁴ Arising through skillful means—this is the bodhisattva's liberation.

"Furthermore, skillful means without wisdom is bondage; wisdom with skillful means is liberation.⁴⁵ Wisdom without skillful means is bondage; skillful means with wisdom is liberation.

"What is skillful means without wisdom as bondage? The bodhisattva, with a mind of craving and views, adorns buddha-lands and brings sentient beings to maturity, while in the dharmas of emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness subduing oneself—this is called skillful means without wisdom as bondage.⁴⁶

"What is wisdom with skillful means as liberation? Not adorning buddha-lands and bringing sentient beings to maturity with a mind of craving and views, while in the dharmas of emptiness, signlessness, and wishlessness subduing oneself without weariness—this is called wisdom with skillful means as liberation.

"What is wisdom without skillful means as bondage? The bodhisattva abides in desire, anger, wrong views, and other afflictions while planting roots of virtue—this is called wisdom without skillful means as bondage.⁴⁷

"What is skillful means with wisdom as liberation? Separating from desire, anger, wrong views, and other afflictions while planting roots of virtue, and dedicating them to *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*—this is called skillful means with wisdom as liberation.

"Mañjuśrī! That ill bodhisattva should contemplate dharmas in this way.

---

## The Bodhisattva's Practice

"Furthermore, contemplate the body as impermanent, suffering, empty, and non-self—this is called wisdom.⁴⁸ Although the body has illness, constantly abiding in birth-and-death, benefiting all beings without weariness—this is called skillful means.

"Furthermore, contemplate the body: the body does not leave illness, illness does not leave the body.⁴⁹ This illness, this body—neither new nor old—this is called wisdom. The body having illness yet not permanently extinguishing—this is called skillful means.

"Mañjuśrī! An ill bodhisattva should thus subdue their mind,⁵⁰ not abiding therein, yet also not abiding in the non-subdued mind. Why is this? To abide in the non-subdued mind is the dharma of foolish beings; to abide in the subdued mind is the dharma of śrāvakas.⁵¹ Therefore, the bodhisattva should not abide in the subdued or non-subdued mind. Separating from these two dharmas—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Being in birth-and-death without polluted practice;⁵² abiding in nirvāṇa without permanent extinction—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Neither the conduct of ordinary beings nor the conduct of sages—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Neither defiled conduct nor pure conduct—this is the bodhisattva's practice.⁵³ Although going beyond demonic conduct, yet manifesting the subduing of Māra's hosts—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Seeking all-knowledge without untimely seeking—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Although contemplating all dharmas as unborn, yet not entering into the fixed position—this is the bodhisattva's practice.⁵⁴ Although contemplating the twelve links of dependent origination, yet entering into wrong views—this is the bodhisattva's practice.⁵⁵ Although gathering all sentient beings, yet not being attached—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Although delighting in seclusion, yet not depending on the extinction of body and mind—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although practicing in the three realms, yet not damaging the dharma-nature—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although practicing emptiness, yet planting roots of virtue—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although practicing signlessness, yet liberating sentient beings—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although practicing wishlessness, yet manifesting the receiving of a body—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Although practicing non-arising, yet arising in all good practices—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although practicing the six perfections, yet universally knowing the minds and mental dharmas of sentient beings—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although practicing the six supernatural powers, yet not exhausting the outflows—this is the bodhisattva's practice.⁵⁶

"Although practicing the four immeasurable minds, yet not craving birth in the Brahmā realm—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although practicing meditation, liberation, and *samādhi*, yet not being born according to meditation—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Although practicing the four foundations of mindfulness, yet not ultimately separating from body, sensations, mind, and dharmas—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although practicing the four right efforts, yet not abandoning bodily and mental diligence—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although practicing the four bases of spiritual power, yet attaining mastery of supernatural powers—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although practicing the five faculties, yet distinguishing the keen and dull faculties of sentient beings—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although practicing the five powers, yet delighting in seeking the Buddha's ten powers—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Although practicing the seven factors of awakening, yet distinguishing the Buddha's wisdom—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although practicing the Noble Eightfold Path, yet delighting in practicing the immeasurable Buddha path—this is the bodhisattva's practice.⁵⁷ Although practicing cessation and contemplation as aids to the path, yet not ultimately falling into extinction—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Although practicing the non-arising and non-ceasing of all dharmas, yet adorning one's body with the major and minor marks—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although manifesting the deportment of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, yet not abandoning the Buddha-Dharma—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although following the ultimate pure characteristic of all dharmas, yet appearing in whatever body is appropriate—this is the bodhisattva's practice.

"Although contemplating all buddha-lands as eternally tranquil like empty space, yet manifesting various pure buddha-lands—this is the bodhisattva's practice. Although attaining the Buddha path, turning the Dharma wheel, and entering nirvāṇa, yet not abandoning the bodhisattva's path—this is the bodhisattva's practice."⁵⁸

# Chapter 6: The Inconceivable (不思議品)

**Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel**

---

## Śāriputra's Concern

At that time, Śāriputra saw that this room had no seats¹ and thought: "Where will all these bodhisattvas and great disciples sit?"

The elder Vimalakirti, knowing his thought, said to Śāriputra: "Well, Venerable! Have you come for the Dharma or have you come for a seat?"²

Śāriputra said: "I have come for the Dharma, not for a seat."

Vimalakirti said: "Ah, Śāriputra! One who seeks the Dharma does not crave even for body and life, much less for a seat!³ One who seeks the Dharma does not seek in form, sensation, perception, volition, or consciousness.⁴ He does not seek in the realms or sense-fields. He does not seek in the desire realm, form realm, or formless realm.

"Ah, Śāriputra! One who seeks the Dharma is not attached to seeking the Buddha, not attached to seeking the Dharma, not attached to seeking the Saṅgha.⁵ One who seeks the Dharma has no view of suffering to see, no view of the origin to cut off, no view of cessation to realize or verify, no view of the path to cultivate.⁶ Why is this? The Dharma is beyond conceptual elaboration.⁷ If one says, 'I shall see suffering, cut off the origin, realize cessation, and cultivate the path,' this is conceptual elaboration, not seeking the Dharma.

"Ah, Śāriputra! The Dharma is named 'extinction.'⁸ If one practices arising and ceasing, this is seeking arising and ceasing, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma is named 'unstained.'⁹ If one is stained by dharmas up to nirvāṇa, this is stainedness, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma is without 'place of action.'¹⁰ If one acts in the Dharma, this is a place of action, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma is without taking or rejecting.¹¹ If one takes or rejects dharmas, this is taking and rejecting, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma is without location.¹² If one is attached to location, this is attachment to location, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma is named 'signless.'¹³ If one follows signs for cognition, this is seeking signs, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma cannot be dwelt in.¹⁴ If one dwells in the Dharma, this is dwelling in the Dharma, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma cannot be seen, heard, felt, or known.¹⁵ If one practices seeing, hearing, feeling, or knowing, this is seeing, hearing, feeling, or knowing—not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma is named 'unconditioned.'¹⁶ If one practices the conditioned, this is seeking the conditioned, not seeking the Dharma.

"Therefore, Śāriputra! One who seeks the Dharma should have no seeking whatsoever toward any dharma."¹⁷

When these words were spoken, five hundred devas attained the pure Dharma-eye¹⁸ with regard to all dharmas.

## The Miraculous Seats

At that time, the elder Vimalakirti asked Mañjuśrī: "Venerable One! In your journeys through immeasurable thousands of myriads of billions of asaṅkhyeya lands,¹⁹ which buddha-land has the finest and most wonderful lion seats accomplished with supreme merit?"

Mañjuśrī said: "Householder! To the east, past thirty-six times the number of sands in the Ganges,²⁰ there is a world called Sumeru-Form. Its buddha is named Sumeru-Lamp-King, presently manifesting there. That buddha's body is eighty-four thousand yojanas tall.²¹ His lion seat is eighty-four thousand yojanas high, magnificently adorned beyond compare."

Thereupon, the elder Vimalakirti manifested his spiritual powers.²² Immediately, that buddha dispatched thirty-two thousand lion seats, lofty, vast, magnificently pure, which entered Vimalakirti's room. The bodhisattvas, great disciples, Śakra, Brahmā, and the Four Heavenly Kings had never seen such a thing before.²³

The room was vast enough to fully accommodate all thirty-two thousand lion seats without any obstruction.²⁴ The city of Vaiśālī, Jambudvīpa, and the four continents were not pressed or crowded—everything appeared as before.

---

## The Miracle of the Small and Large

At that time, Vimalakirti said to Mañjuśrī: "Please take a lion seat! Together with all the bodhisattvas and superior beings, be seated. You should make your body conform to the size of that seat."²⁵

Those bodhisattvas who had attained spiritual powers immediately transformed their bodies to forty-two thousand yojanas and sat on the lion seats.²⁶ But the newly-aspired bodhisattvas and great disciples could not ascend.

Then Vimalakirti said to Śāriputra: "Take a lion seat!"

Śāriputra said: "Householder! This seat is high and vast—I cannot ascend it."²⁷

Vimalakirti said: "Ah, Śāriputra! Make obeisance to the Tathāgata Sumeru-Lamp-King, and then you will be able to sit."²⁸

Thereupon, the newly-aspired bodhisattvas and great disciples made obeisance to the Tathāgata Sumeru-Lamp-King, and were then able to sit on the lion seats.

---

## The Inconceivable Liberation

Śāriputra said: "Householder! How unprecedented! Such a small room can contain these lofty and vast seats!²⁹ The city of Vaiśālī is not obstructed. Nor are the villages and cities of Jambudvīpa, the four continents, the palaces of the devas, dragon-kings, and spirits pressed or crowded."

Vimalakirti said: "Ah, Śāriputra! For the buddhas and bodhisattvas, there is a liberation called 'Inconceivable.'³⁰ If a bodhisattva abides in this liberation, he can place the height and vastness of Mount Sumeru within a mustard seed,³¹ with no increase or decrease. Mount Sumeru, King of Mountains, remains in its original form. The Four Heavenly Kings and the gods of Trāyastriṃśa³² are not aware of having entered it—only those fit to be liberated see Sumeru enter the mustard seed. This is called abiding in the Dharma-gate of Inconceivable Liberation.³³

"Furthermore, he can place the waters of the four great oceans within a single pore³⁴ without disturbing the fish, turtles, sea-monsters, or other water-creatures. Those great oceans remain in their original form. The dragons, spirits, and asuras are not aware of having entered it—nor are any of those beings harmed.

"Furthermore, Śāriputra! A bodhisattva abiding in the Inconceivable Liberation can take the great thousand-fold world,³⁵ as if picking up a potter's wheel, and place it in his right palm.³⁶ He can throw it past worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, and the beings within it are not aware of having come or gone. He then returns it to its original place, and no one thinks they have traveled—yet the world remains as before.

"Furthermore, Śāriputra! If there are beings who delight in long life and can be liberated thereby, the bodhisattva can extend seven days to become an aeon,³⁷ and those beings will consider it an aeon. Or if there are beings who do not delight in long life and can be liberated thereby, the bodhisattva can compress an aeon into seven days,³⁸ and those beings will consider it seven days.

"Furthermore, Śāriputra! A bodhisattva abiding in the Inconceivable Liberation can gather the adornments of all buddha-lands into a single land³⁹ and display them to sentient beings. Furthermore, the bodhisattva can take all sentient beings of a buddha-land, place them in his right palm, and fly to the ten directions,⁴⁰ showing all while not moving from the original place.

"Furthermore, Śāriputra! All the offerings that beings of the ten directions make to the buddhas can be seen in a single pore.⁴¹ The suns, moons, and stars of all lands of the ten directions can be seen in a single pore.

"Furthermore, Śāriputra! All the winds of the ten directions can be drawn into the bodhisattva's mouth⁴² without harming his body, and the trees outside are not snapped. When the great thousand-fold world is consumed by fire at the end of an aeon, the bodhisattva can draw all the fire into his belly,⁴³ and the fire continues to burn but does him no harm.

"Furthermore, past worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges below, he can take up a buddha-land and raise it past worlds as numerous as sands of the Ganges above—as if lifting a jujube leaf on a needle-point—and no beings are harmed.⁴⁴

"Furthermore, Śāriputra! A bodhisattva abiding in the Inconceivable Liberation can manifest through spiritual powers the body of a buddha, the body of a pratyekabuddha, the body of a śrāvaka, the body of Śakra, the body of Brahmā, the body of a world-lord, or the body of a wheel-turning king.⁴⁵

"Furthermore, all sounds—high, middle, and low—of beings in the ten directions can be transformed into the Buddha's voice,⁴⁶ expounding the sounds of impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and non-self, as well as the various teachings spoken by the buddhas of the ten directions. All can be heard universally within them.

"Śāriputra! I have now briefly spoken of the power of the bodhisattva's Inconceivable Liberation. If I were to speak of it extensively, I would not finish even in an aeon."⁴⁷

---

## Mahākāśyapa's Response

At that time, Mahākāśyapa, having heard this teaching of the bodhisattva's Inconceivable Liberation Dharma-gate,⁴⁸ sighed in wonder and said to Śāriputra: "It is like displaying various colors before a blind person—they cannot see them.⁴⁹ Thus, when all śrāvakas hear this Dharma-gate of the Inconceivable Liberation, they cannot understand it.

"When the wise hear this, who would not arouse the aspiration for *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*?⁵⁰ We have permanently cut off our roots with regard to this Great Vehicle—we are like spoiled seeds!⁵¹ All śrāvakas who hear this Dharma-gate of the Inconceivable Liberation should weep and wail, their voices shaking the great thousand-fold world.⁵²

"All bodhisattvas should greatly rejoice and receive this Dharma on the crown of their heads.⁵³ If there is a bodhisattva who faithfully understands this Dharma-gate of the Inconceivable Liberation, all the hosts of Māra can do nothing to him."

When Mahākāśyapa spoke these words, thirty-two thousand devas all aroused the aspiration for *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*.⁵⁴

---

## Māra as Teacher

At that time, Vimalakirti said to Mahākāśyapa: "Venerable One! In immeasurable asaṅkhyeya worlds of the ten directions, those who act as māra-kings are mostly bodhisattvas abiding in the Inconceivable Liberation.⁵⁵ Through the power of skillful means, they educate sentient beings by manifesting as māra-kings.

"Furthermore, Kāśyapa! In immeasurable lands of the ten directions, there are bodhisattvas from whom people beg hands, feet, ears, noses, heads, eyes, marrow, brains, blood, flesh, skin, bones, villages, cities, wives, children, servants, elephants, horses, carriages, gold, silver, lapis lazuli, mother-of-pearl, agate, coral, amber, pearls, shells, clothing, and food.⁵⁶ Most of these beggars are bodhisattvas abiding in the Inconceivable Liberation who, through the power of skillful means, test and strengthen other bodhisattvas.⁵⁷

"Why is this? Bodhisattvas abiding in the Inconceivable Liberation have the power of majestic virtue,⁵⁸ and so they manifest such pressing trials, showing sentient beings these difficult things. Ordinary beings with inferior power cannot in this way press bodhisattvas.⁵⁹

"It is like the trampling of a dragon-elephant—an ass cannot bear it.⁶⁰ This is called the gate of wisdom and skillful means of bodhisattvas abiding in the Inconceivable Liberation."

# Chapter 6: The Inconceivable Liberation

## 不思議品第六

*Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel*

## Śāriputra's Dilemma

At that time, Śāriputra saw that there were no seats in the chamber and thought: "Where will all these bodhisattvas and great disciples sit?"

The elder Vimalakīrti, knowing his thought, said to Śāriputra: "What is it, venerable one? Have you come for the Dharma, or have you come seeking a seat?"

Śāriputra replied: "I have come for the Dharma, not for a seat."

---

## The True Seeker of Dharma

Vimalakīrti said: "Śāriputra! One who truly seeks the Dharma does not covet even their own body and life—how much less a seat! One who seeks the Dharma does not seek through form, sensation, perception, mental formations, or consciousness. One who seeks the Dharma does not seek through the realms, sense-bases, or the realms of desire, form, and formlessness.

"Śāriputra! One who seeks the Dharma is not attached to seeking the Buddha, not attached to seeking the Dharma, not attached to seeking the Sangha. One who seeks the Dharma does not seek by seeing suffering, does not seek by cutting off the origin, does not seek by realizing cessation or cultivating the path. Why is this?

"The Dharma is free from idle speculation (*prapañca*). If one says 'I will see suffering, cut off the origin, realize cessation, and cultivate the path'—this is idle speculation, not seeking the Dharma.

"Śāriputra! The Dharma is called 'quiescence.' If one practices arising and ceasing, one seeks arising and ceasing, not the Dharma. The Dharma is called 'undefiled.' If one is attached to dharmas, even up to nirvāṇa, this is defilement, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma has no place of practice. If one practices in the dharmas, this is a place of practice, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma has no grasping or rejecting. If one grasps or rejects dharmas, this is grasping and rejecting, not seeking the Dharma.

"The Dharma has no location. If one is attached to location, this is attachment to location, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma is called 'signless.' If one follows signs and cognizes, this is seeking signs, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma cannot be abided in. If one abides in the Dharma, this is abiding in dharmas, not seeking the Dharma. The Dharma cannot be seen, heard, sensed, or known. If one practices seeing, hearing, sensing, and knowing, this is seeing, hearing, sensing, and knowing—not seeking the Dharma.

"The Dharma is called 'unconditioned.' If one practices the conditioned, this is seeking the conditioned, not seeking the Dharma. Therefore, Śāriputra! One who seeks the Dharma should have nothing to seek in regard to any dharma."[^1]

When these words were spoken, five hundred gods attained the purity of the Dharma-eye regarding all dharmas.

[^1]: This passage represents the apex of apophatic (*via negativa*) Mahāyāna teaching—the Dharma cannot be approached through any conventional means, including the Four Noble Truths themselves when grasped as substantial realities.

## The Thirty-Two Thousand Lion Thrones

At that time, the elder Vimalakīrti asked Manjuśrī: "Venerable one! You have traveled through countless billions of immeasurable *asaṃkhyeya* worlds—which buddha-land has lion thrones of supreme and wondrous merit?"

Manjuśrī replied: "Householder! To the east, past thirty-six times the sands of the Ganges River worlds, there is a realm called Sumeru-Mark. Its buddha is named Sumeru Lamp King, and he is presently there. That buddha's body is 84,000 *yojanas* tall. His lion throne is 84,000 *yojanas* high, supremely adorned."[^2]

Thereupon, the elder Vimalakīrti displayed his supernatural power, and immediately that buddha sent 32,000 lion thrones—lofty, vast, and magnificently pure—which entered Vimalakīrti's chamber. All the bodhisattvas, great disciples, Śakra, Brahmā, and the Four Heavenly Kings had never seen such a thing before.

The chamber was broad and vast, completely containing all 32,000 lion thrones with no obstruction whatsoever. In the city of Vaiśālī and in Jambudvīpa and the four continents, there was also no crowding—everything appeared as before.

[^2]: A *yojana* is an ancient Indian measure of distance, approximately 7-9 miles. A throne 84,000 yojanas high would extend from earth far beyond the atmosphere—an image emphasizing the inconceivable nature of this liberation.

---

## Those Who Cannot Ascend

Then Vimalakīrti said to Manjuśrī: "Please take a lion throne! Together with all the bodhisattvas and superior beings, sit down—but you must transform your bodies to match the size of the thrones."

Those bodhisattvas who had attained supernatural powers immediately transformed themselves to be 42,000 *yojanas* tall and sat on the lion thrones. But the newly-initiated bodhisattvas and the great disciples were unable to ascend.

Then Vimalakīrti said to Śāriputra: "Please take a lion throne!"

Śāriputra replied: "Householder! These thrones are so lofty and vast that I cannot ascend. How can I sit?"

Vimalakīrti said: "Śāriputra! You must pay homage to Sumeru Lamp King Tathāgata, and then you will be able to sit."

Thereupon, the newly-initiated bodhisattvas and the great disciples paid homage to Sumeru Lamp King Tathāgata, and they were able to sit on the lion thrones.

---

## The Small Room That Contains Everything

Śāriputra exclaimed: "Householder! This is unprecedented! Such a small room contains these lofty and vast thrones, and there is no obstruction in the city of Vaiśālī. And in Jambudvīpa—in its villages and cities—and in all the four continents, in the palaces of the gods, dragon kings, and spirits, there is also no crowding!"

---

## The Inconceivable Liberation Explained

Vimalakīrti said: "Śāriputra! The buddhas and bodhisattvas have a liberation called 'the Inconceivable.' If a bodhisattva abides in this liberation, they can place the height and breadth of Mount Sumeru inside a mustard seed without either increasing or decreasing—Mount Sumeru, King of Mountains, remains as before in its original form, and the Four Heavenly Kings and the gods of Trāyastriṃśa neither perceive nor know that they have entered. Only those who are to be liberated see Mount Sumeru enter the mustard seed. This is called 'abiding in the gateway of inconceivable liberation.'

"Furthermore, they can place the waters of the four great oceans into a single hair-pore without disturbing the fish, turtles, tortoises, crocodiles, and other water creatures—and the great oceans remain in their original form. The dragons, spirits, and asuras neither perceive nor know that they have entered, and these beings are not disturbed in the slightest.

"Furthermore, Śāriputra! A bodhisattva abiding in inconceivable liberation can take the great trichiliocosm, like a potter's wheel, and place it in the palm of their right hand, and cast it past worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, yet the beings within neither perceive nor know where they are going. And it can be returned to its original place, with no being having any notion of coming or going, and the world remains in its original form.

"Furthermore, Śāriputra! If there are beings who delight in long lives and can thereby be liberated, the bodhisattva extends seven days to become one *kalpa*, causing those beings to perceive it as one kalpa. If there are beings who do not delight in long lives and can thereby be liberated, the bodhisattva compresses one kalpa into seven days, causing those beings to perceive it as seven days.

"Furthermore, Śāriputra! A bodhisattva abiding in inconceivable liberation gathers the adornments of all buddha-lands into a single land and displays them to beings. And a bodhisattva can place the beings of one buddha-land in the palm of their right hand and fly throughout the ten directions, showing them everything, without moving from their original place.

"Furthermore, Śāriputra! The offerings made by beings of the ten directions to all buddhas—a bodhisattva can make them all visible in a single hair-pore. And all the suns, moons, and stars of the lands of the ten directions can be made universally visible in a single hair-pore.

"Furthermore, Śāriputra! All the winds of the worlds of the ten directions—a bodhisattva can suck them all into their mouth without harming their body, and the trees outside are not damaged. And when the *kalpas* of the ten directions end in conflagration, the bodhisattva can take all the fires into their belly—the fires function as before, without causing harm.

"Furthermore, taking one buddha-land from below, past worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges, and raising it upward, past countless worlds as numerous as the sands of the Ganges—like lifting a leaf on a needle point—without disturbance.

"Furthermore, Śāriputra! A bodhisattva abiding in inconceivable liberation can manifest through supernatural powers a buddha-body, or a pratyekabuddha-body, or a śrāvaka-body, or a Śakra-body, or a Brahma-body, or a world-lord-body, or a wheel-turning-king-body.

"Furthermore, all the sounds of the worlds of the ten directions—high, medium, and low—can all be transformed into the Buddha's voice, proclaiming the sounds of impermanence, suffering, emptiness, and non-self, as well as the various teachings spoken by all the buddhas of the ten directions, causing all within to hear them.

"Śāriputra! I have now given a brief account of the power of the bodhisattva's inconceivable liberation. If I were to speak of it extensively, I could not exhaust it in an entire *kalpa*."[^3]

[^3]: This inventory of "inconceivable" powers illustrates the Mahāyāna teaching that space, time, and causality are conventional appearances (*saṃvṛti*) rather than ultimate realities. The liberated mind operates beyond these constraints.

---

## Mahākāśyapa's Lament

At this time, Mahākāśyapa heard the teaching of the bodhisattva's inconceivable liberation gateway and sighed in wonder. He said to Śāriputra:

"It is like displaying various colored forms before a blind person—they cannot see them. Just so, when all the śrāvakas hear this gateway of inconceivable liberation, they cannot understand it! When the wise hear this, who among them would not arouse the aspiration for *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*?

"Why have we forever cut off our roots? Regarding this Great Vehicle, we are already like scorched seeds![^4] All the śrāvakas, hearing this gateway of inconceivable liberation, should weep with voices that shake the great trichiliocosm! All the bodhisattvas should rejoice greatly and receive this teaching upon their heads with reverence.

"If there are bodhisattvas who believe in and understand this gateway of inconceivable liberation, all the hosts of Māra can do nothing to them."

When Mahākāśyapa spoke these words, 32,000 gods all aroused the aspiration for *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*.

[^4]: "Scorched seeds" (*dagdha-bīja*) is the famous metaphor for arhats who, having eradicated the defilements, have also eliminated the capacity for bodhisattva awakening. This self-deprecation reflects the sutra's critique of the śrāvaka path as incomplete.

---

## The Māras Are Bodhisattvas

Then Vimalakīrti said to Mahākāśyapa: "Venerable one! In the countless immeasurable *asaṃkhyeya* worlds of the ten directions, those who act as māra-kings are mostly bodhisattvas abiding in inconceivable liberation. Through the power of skillful means, they teach beings by appearing as māra-kings.

"Furthermore, Kāśyapa! Among the countless bodhisattvas of the ten directions, sometimes there are people who come begging for hands, feet, ears, nose, head, eyes, marrow, brain, blood, flesh, skin, bone, villages, cities, wives, children, servants, elephants, horses, carriages, gold, silver, lapis lazuli, crystal, agate, coral, amber, pearls, shells, clothing, and food. Such beggars are mostly bodhisattvas abiding in inconceivable liberation who, through the power of skillful means, come to test them and make them firm.

"Why is this? Bodhisattvas abiding in inconceivable liberation have the power of awesome virtue, and thus they manifest oppressive demands to show beings what is difficult. Ordinary beings who are inferior have no power or force—they cannot oppress bodhisattvas in this way. It is like the trampling of a dragon-elephant, which a donkey cannot endure.

"This is called the gateway of wisdom and skillful means of bodhisattvas abiding in inconceivable liberation."

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Key Philosophical Concepts

1. **Apophatic Dharma-Seeking**: Vimalakīrti's teaching that the true seeker has "nothing to seek" represents the consummate application of *śūnyatā* (emptiness) to spiritual practice itself.

2. **The Inconceivable (*acintya*)**: This term encompasses powers that transcend conventional causality—not magic in the vulgar sense, but the natural expression of a mind liberated from reified distinctions of space, time, and size.

3. **Scorched Seeds**: Mahākāśyapa's self-critique articulates the sutra's position that the arhat's liberation, while genuine, forecloses the greater possibility of universal salvation.

4. **Māra as Bodhisattva**: The revelation that demon kings are actually bodhisattvas teaching through adversity extends the non-dual logic to its radical conclusion—even evil serves awakening.

### Cross-References

- The lion throne imagery connects to the Buddha's "lion's roar" (*siṃhanāda*) tradition
- Mount Sumeru in a mustard seed appears in the Avataṃsaka Sūtra's Dharmadhātu imagery
- The extension/compression of time parallels Einstein's relativity—a point noted by D.T. Suzuki

# Chapter 7: Observing Sentient Beings (觀眾生品)

**Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel**

---

## The Question of Vision

At that time, Mañjuśrī asked Vimalakirti: "How should a bodhisattva observe sentient beings?"¹

Vimalakirti said: "Like a magician observing the persons he has conjured,² so should a bodhisattva observe sentient beings. Like a wise person viewing a reflection in water; like viewing an image in a mirror;³ like a mirage in heat; like the echo of a voice; like clouds in the sky; like form in the formless realm; like the path of a bird in the sky; like the child of a barren woman; like the arising of afflictions in a conjured person;⁴ like seeing in a dream after awakening; like the receiving of a body by one who has entered nirvāṇa; like fire without fuel⁵—thus should a bodhisattva observe sentient beings."

---

## Compassion Without Object

Mañjuśrī said: "If a bodhisattva contemplates in this way, how should they practice loving-kindness (*maitrī*)?"⁶

Vimalakirti said: "Having contemplated in this way, the bodhisattva thinks: 'I shall expound such Dharma to sentient beings.'⁷ This is true loving-kindness.

"Practice the loving-kindness of extinction—because there is no arising. Practice the loving-kindness that is without heat—because there is no affliction. Practice the loving-kindness of equality—because it is equal throughout the three times. Practice the loving-kindness without conflict—because nothing arises. Practice the loving-kindness of non-duality—because inside and outside do not come together. Practice the loving-kindness that is indestructible—because it is finally exhausted [of self].⁸

"Practice the loving-kindness that is firm—because the mind is not destroyed. Practice the loving-kindness that is pure—because the nature of all dharmas is pure. Practice the loving-kindness without limit—like empty space. Practice the loving-kindness of an arhat—because it destroys the bandits of affliction. Practice the loving-kindness of a bodhisattva—because it brings beings to peace. Practice the loving-kindness of a Tathāgata—because it attains the characteristic of suchness.

"Practice the loving-kindness of a Buddha—because it awakens sentient beings. Practice the loving-kindness that is spontaneous—because it is attained without cause.⁹ Practice the loving-kindness of awakening (*bodhi*)—because it is of one taste. Practice the loving-kindness without equal—because it cuts off all craving. Practice the loving-kindness of great compassion—because it leads by the Great Vehicle. Practice the loving-kindness that is unwearying—because it contemplates emptiness and non-self.

"Practice the loving-kindness of Dharma-giving (*dharma-dāna*)—because it holds nothing back. Practice the loving-kindness of moral discipline (*śīla*)—because it transforms those who transgress. Practice the loving-kindness of patience (*kṣānti*)—because it protects self and others. Practice the loving-kindness of vigor (*vīrya*)—because it takes up the burden of sentient beings. Practice the loving-kindness of meditation (*dhyāna*)—because it does not accept the taste. Practice the loving-kindness of wisdom (*prajñā*)—because there is no not-knowing-the-time.

"Practice the loving-kindness of skillful means (*upāya*)—because all is manifested. Practice the loving-kindness without concealment—because the straight mind is pure. Practice the loving-kindness of deep mind—because there is no mixed practice. Practice the loving-kindness without deception—because it is not false. Practice the loving-kindness of joyfulness—because it causes the attainment of Buddha-joy. The loving-kindness of the bodhisattva is thus."

---

## Compassion, Sympathetic Joy, and Equanimity

Mañjuśrī again asked: "What is called compassion (*karuṇā*)?"¹⁰

He answered: "The merit accomplished by the bodhisattva is shared with all sentient beings."

"What is called sympathetic joy (*muditā*)?"

He answered: "Whatever benefit there is, one rejoices without regret."

"What is called equanimity (*upekṣā*)?"

He answered: "Whatever merit is performed, there is no expectation."¹¹

---

## What Sentient Beings Rely On

Mañjuśrī again asked: "In the fear of birth and death, on what should the bodhisattva rely?"

Vimalakirti said: "The bodhisattva in the fear of birth and death should rely on the power of the Tathāgata's merit."¹²

Mañjuśrī again asked: "If the bodhisattva wishes to rely on the power of the Tathāgata's merit, where should they abide?"

He answered: "If the bodhisattva wishes to rely on the power of the Tathāgata's merit, they should abide in liberating all sentient beings."

Again he asked: "Wishing to liberate sentient beings, what should be eliminated?"

He answered: "Wishing to liberate sentient beings, one should eliminate their afflictions."

Again he asked: "Wishing to eliminate afflictions, what should be practiced?"

He answered: "Practice right mindfulness (*samyak-smṛti*)."

Again he asked: "How does one practice right mindfulness?"

He answered: "Practice the unborn and unceasing."

Again he asked: "What dharma doesn't arise? What dharma doesn't cease?"

He answered: "The unwholesome doesn't arise; the wholesome doesn't cease."

Again he asked: "What is the root of the wholesome and unwholesome?"

He answered: "The body is the root."¹³

Again he asked: "What is the root of the body?"

He answered: "Desire and craving is the root."

Again he asked: "What is the root of desire and craving?"

He answered: "False discrimination is the root."¹⁴

Again he asked: "What is the root of false discrimination?"

He answered: "Inverted thought is the root."

Again he asked: "What is the root of inverted thought?"

He answered: "Non-abiding (*apratisṭhāna*) is the root."¹⁵

Again he asked: "What is the root of non-abiding?"

He answered: "Non-abiding is without root. Mañjuśrī! From the rootless root of non-abiding, all dharmas are established."¹⁶

---

## The Goddess and the Flowers

At that time, there was a goddess in Vimalakirti's room. Seeing these great beings hearing the Dharma expounded, she revealed her form and scattered heavenly flowers over the bodhisattvas and great disciples. When the flowers reached the bodhisattvas, they all fell away. When they reached the great disciples, they stuck and would not fall. All the disciples used their spiritual powers to remove the flowers, but could not make them drop.

Then the goddess asked Śāriputra: "Why do you try to remove the flowers?"

He answered: "These flowers are not in accordance with the Dharma, therefore I remove them."

The goddess said: "Do not say these flowers are not in accordance with the Dharma. Why? These flowers are without discrimination—it is the venerable one who generates discriminating thought. If one who has left home in accordance with Buddha-Dharma has discrimination, this is not in accordance with the Dharma. If without discrimination, this is in accordance with the Dharma.

"Look at the bodhisattvas—the flowers do not stick to them because they have already cut off all discriminating thought. Like one who is afraid—non-humans gain access to him. Thus, the disciples fear birth and death, so form, sound, smell, taste, and touch gain access to them. Those who are separated from fear—the five desires can do nothing to them. Where habit-energies (*vāsanā*) are not exhausted, the flowers stick. Where habit-energies are exhausted, the flowers do not stick."¹⁷

---

## The Dialogue on Time and Liberation

Śāriputra said: "Goddess! How long have you been in this room?"

She answered: "I have been in this room as long as the venerable elder's liberation."

Śāriputra said: "You have been here that long?"

The goddess said: "Is the venerable elder's liberation that old?"¹⁸

Śāriputra was silent and did not answer.

The goddess said: "Why is the great wise elder silent?"

He answered: "Liberation is without words, therefore I do not know what to say."

The goddess said: "Words and letters are all liberation-characteristics. Why is this? Liberation is not internal, not external, not in between. Letters also are not internal, not external, not in between. Therefore, Śāriputra! Do not separate from letters to speak of liberation. Why? All dharmas are liberation-characteristics."

---

## Neither Desire, Anger, nor Delusion

Śāriputra said: "Is it not liberation to separate from desire, anger, and delusion?"

The goddess said: "The Buddha spoke of separating from desire, anger, and delusion as liberation for those with excessive pride (*adhimāna*). For those without excessive pride, the Buddha taught that the nature of desire, anger, and delusion is itself liberation."¹⁹

Śāriputra said: "Excellent, excellent! Goddess! What have you attained? What have you realized, that your eloquence is like this?"

The goddess said: "I have attained nothing and realized nothing—therefore my eloquence is like this. Why? If anyone has attainment and realization, with respect to Buddha-Dharma they have excessive pride."

---

## The Three Vehicles

Śāriputra asked the goddess: "Of the three vehicles, which do you aspire to?"

The goddess said: "When I teach sentient beings using śrāvaka-dharma, I am a śrāvaka. When I teach using pratyekabuddha-dharma, I am a pratyekabuddha. When I teach using great compassion, I am of the Great Vehicle.

"Śāriputra! Like one who enters a *campaka* grove and smells only *campaka*, not other fragrances, so one entering this room smells only the fragrance of Buddha-merit, not the fragrance of śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha merit.

"Śāriputra! When Śakra, Brahmā, the Four Heavenly Kings, and the devas, dragons, and spirits enter this room, hearing this superior person expound the right Dharma, they all delight in the fragrance of Buddha-merit and arouse the aspiration [for unexcelled awakening].

"Śāriputra! I have been in this room for twelve years. I have never heard the Dharma of śrāvaka or pratyekabuddha—only the great compassion, the inconceivable, the Buddha-Dharma of all Buddhas.

"Śāriputra! This room constantly manifests eight unprecedented and difficult-to-attain dharmas. What are the eight?

"This room always shines with golden light, day and night without difference, not illuminated by sun or moon—this is the first.

"Those who enter this room are not troubled by defilements—this is the second.

"This room is never without Śakra, Brahmā, the Four Heavenly Kings, and bodhisattvas from other lands—this is the third.²⁰

"This room always expounds the six perfections (*pāramitās*) and the non-retrogressive Dharma—this is the fourth.

"This room always produces heavenly music of the foremost among humans and devas, with strings emanating immeasurable sounds of Dharma-transformation—this is the fifth.

"This room has four great treasuries, full of accumulated jewels, supplying the poor without exhausting—this is the sixth.

"This room, when this superior person contemplates, is immediately visited by Śākyamuni Buddha, Amitābha Buddha, Akṣobhya Buddha, Precious Virtue, Precious Flame, Precious Moon, Precious Adornment, Difficult to Conquer, Lion Sound, All-Accomplishing, and other immeasurable Buddhas of the ten directions. They extensively expound the secret and essential Dharma-treasure of all Buddhas, and having spoken, they return—this is the seventh.²¹

"In this room, all the magnificently adorned palaces of the devas and the pure lands of all Buddhas all appear within it—this is the eighth.

"Śāriputra! This room constantly manifests these eight unprecedented and difficult-to-attain dharmas. Who, seeing these inconceivable things, would still delight in śrāvaka-dharma?"

---

## Why Not Transform the Female Body?

Śāriputra asked: "Why do you not transform your female body?"²²

The goddess said: "For the past twelve years I have sought the characteristics of a female—I cannot find them. What is there to transform? It is like a magician who creates an illusory woman. If someone asks, 'Why don't you transform your female body?'—is this person asking correctly?"

Śāriputra said: "No! An illusion has no fixed characteristics—what would be transformed?"

The goddess said: "All dharmas are likewise—without fixed characteristics. Why do you ask, 'Why don't you transform your female body?'"

Immediately, the goddess used her spiritual powers to transform Śāriputra into her form, while she transformed herself into Śāriputra's form and asked: "Why don't you transform your female body?"

Śāriputra, in the goddess's form, answered: "I do not know how I have transformed into a female body!"²³

The goddess said: "Śāriputra! If you could transform this female body, then all women could also transform. Just as Śāriputra is not female yet appears as a female body, so too all women—though they appear as female bodies—are not female. Therefore the Buddha says: 'All dharmas are neither male nor female.'"²⁴

Immediately, the goddess withdrew her spiritual powers, and Śāriputra's body returned to its former state.

The goddess asked Śāriputra: "Where now are the forms and characteristics of the female body?"

Śāriputra said: "The forms and characteristics of the female body are neither present nor absent."

The goddess said: "All dharmas are likewise—neither present nor absent. That they are neither present nor absent is what the Buddha teaches."

---

## Where Will the Goddess Be Born?

Śāriputra asked the goddess: "When you pass away from here, where will you be born?"

The goddess said: "I will be born as the Buddha's transformation is born."

He said: "The Buddha's transformation is not birth and death."

The goddess said: "Sentient beings are likewise—no birth and death."²⁵

Śāriputra asked the goddess: "How long until you attain *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*?"

The goddess said: "When Śāriputra returns to being an ordinary person, then I shall attain *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*."

Śāriputra said: "It is impossible for me to return to being an ordinary person."

The goddess said: "It is likewise impossible for me to attain *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*. Why? Because bodhi has no place of abiding—therefore no one attains it."

Śāriputra said: "Present Buddhas have attained *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*, those who have already attained it and those who will attain it are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges—how do you explain this?"

The goddess said: "All this is spoken in terms of worldly conventional language and numbers. Bodhi is not past, future, or present."

The goddess said: "Śāriputra! Have you attained the arhat path?"

He said: "I attained it because there is nothing to attain."

The goddess said: "Buddhas and bodhisattvas are likewise—they attain because there is nothing to attain."

---

## The Goddess's Identity

At that time, Vimalakirti said to Śāriputra: "This goddess has already made offerings to ninety-two billion Buddhas. She can sport in the spiritual powers of bodhisattvas. Her vows are complete; she has attained non-arising patience (*anutpattika-dharma-kṣānti*) and abides in non-retrogression (*avaivartika*). By her original vow, she appears according to her intentions, teaching and transforming sentient beings."

### Footnotes

1.  **How should a bodhisattva observe sentient beings?** (菩薩云何觀於眾生): This inquiry shifts the dialogue from emptiness of phenomena to the emptiness of the person (*pudgala-nairātmya*). Mañjuśrī challenges Vimalakirti to reconcile the bodhisattva's vow to save beings with the ultimate truth that no "being" exists.
2.  **Like a magician**: *Māyākāra*. The simile of the magician is central to Mahāyāna ontology. Beings exist conventionally, like illusions created by a magician, but lack intrinsic existence (*svabhāva*).
3.  **Viewing an image in a mirror**: This metaphor emphasizes that sentient beings are reflections of causes and conditions, appearing clearly yet devoid of substance.
4.  **Afflictions in a conjured person**: A particularly layered metaphor. A conjured person cannot truly have afflictions (*kleśa*) because they have no mind; similarly, ultimate reality is free of affliction, yet the appearance of affliction drives the wheel of samsara.
5.  **Fire without fuel**: Indicating an impossibility. Trying to find a substantial "self" in the aggregates is as futile as seeking fire without fuel.
6.  **Loving-kindness** (*maitrī*): Mañjuśrī's follow-up is critical. If beings are illusions, to whom is kindness directed? This is the paradox of "objectless compassion" (*anālambana-karuṇā*).
7.  **Expound such Dharma**: Vimalakirti redefines compassion not as emotional attachment to persons, but as the will to awaken them to their own illusoriness.
8.  **Indestructible**: The text here plays on the double meaning of "exhaustion" (*kṣaya*). True kindness is indestructible because the false self has been exhausted.
9.  **Spontaneous**: *Anabhisaṃskāra*. Compassion that arises without volition or calculation, flowing naturally from wisdom.
10. **Compassion** (*karuṇā*): Distinguished here from maitrī. Maitrī is the wish for happiness; karuṇā is the wish to remove suffering.
11. **No expectation**: *Upekṣā* (equanimity) is defined here as action without attachment to fruit (*phala*).
12. **Tathāgata's merit**: The true refuge is not a place or a deity, but the accumulated merit of the Buddha-nature, which transcends birth and death.
13. **The body is the root**: A surprising turn. Vimalakirti traces the chain of causation backwards: wholesome/unwholesome karma depends on having a body to act.
14. **False discrimination**: *Vikalpa*. The root of desire is the mind's tendency to bifurcate reality into subject/object, good/bad.
15. **Non-abiding** (*apratisṭhāna*): The ultimate ground. If thought relies on discrimination, and discrimination relies on inversion, inversion relies on... nothing. There is no foundation. This is the "rootless root."
16. **All dharmas are established**: Because there is no fixed ground (emptiness), infinite possibilities (dependent origination) can be established.
17. **Habit-energies** (*vāsanā*): The latent tendencies or "perfuming" left by past kamma. Even if intellectual defilements are cut, these subtle emotional habits remain—symbolized by the flowers sticking.
18. **Is liberation that old?**: A sharp rebuke of Śāriputra's linear time concept. Liberation is outside time; asking "how long" is a category error.
19. **Nature of desire... is liberation**: A radical Tantric/Vajrayana precursor. Defilements are not to be abandoned but seen into. Their essential nature (*svabhāva*) is empty, hence liberated.
20. **Other lands**: The room is a cosmic portal, connected to the multiverse of Buddhas.
21. **Secret and essential Dharma-treasure**: Refers to teachings on the Tathāgatagarbha or ultimate emptiness, often reserved for advanced bodhisattvas.
22. **Transform your female body**: Śāriputra assumes the female form is inferior and a result of bad karma, reflecting traditional Indian social views.
23. **I do not know how**: Śāriputra's confusion highlights the fluidity of form. "He" is now "she," proving that gender is a performance, not an essence.
24. **Neither male nor female**: A definitive statement on the emptiness of gender. Enlightenment is sexless.
25. **Sentient beings are likewise**: Just as a magical creation doesn't truly die because it was never truly born, so too beings.

### Key Philosophical Concepts

**The Goddess (Devatā)**:
The appearance of the goddess marks a pivot in the sutra. She is not a disciple but a fully enlightened presence equal to Vimalakirti. Her gender is utilized as a skillful means (*upāya*) to smash Śāriputra's residual dualistic thinking. She represents **Prajñā** (Wisdom), traditionally personified as female (Prauñāpāramitā creates all Buddhas, hence "Mother of Buddhas"), demonstrating that wisdom transcends social and biological categories.

**The "Sticky" Flowers**:
A brilliant metaphor for **attachment** (*upādāna*) versus **liberation**. The flowers are neutral phenomena. They "stick" only where there is an emotional hook—in this case, the disciples' fear of samsara and desire for purity. The bodhisattvas, having no fear and no concept of "pure/impure," offer no surface for the flowers to adhere to. This teaches that the problem is not the object (flower/world), but the mind's reactvity.

**Non-Abiding (Apratisṭhāna)**:
Vimalakirti's "genealogy of confusion" ends with "Non-abiding." This is the abyss of Emptiness. It is not that confusion comes from a mistake; confusion comes from the groundlessness of reality itself. However, Vimalakirti flips this: precisely *because* there is no static foundation, everything can arise. Form is Emptiness; Emptiness is Form.

### Cross-References

-   **Lotus Sūtra, Ch. 12 (Devadatta)**: The Dragon Girl transforms into a male to attain Buddhahood. The Vimalakirti Sutra critiques this by having the goddess *refuse* to transform, arguing that "female" is already empty. It is a more advanced feminist critique than the Lotus.
-   **Heart Sutra**: "No eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, mind." The goddess echoes this negation of fixed characteristics.
-   **Diamond Sutra**: "Whether they be born from eggs, from wombs... I lead them all to Nirvana without remainder." Compare with "Compassion without object."
-   **Mādhyamakakārikā (Nāgārjuna), Ch. 25**: "Nirvana is not different from Samsara." The goddess's teaching that "desire, anger, delusion are liberation" is pure Mādhyamaka.

# Chapter 8: The Buddha Path (佛道品)

**Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel**

---

## The Non-Path as the Path

At that time, Mañjuśrī asked Vimalakirti: "How does a bodhisattva penetrate the Buddha Path?"¹

Vimalakirti said: "If a bodhisattva travels the non-path (*amārga*), this is penetrating the Buddha Path."

Again he asked: "How does a bodhisattva travel the non-path?"

He answered: "If a bodhisattva performs the five deadly sins but feels no vexation or anger; goes to hell but is without sin or defilement; goes to the animal realm but is without ignorance or arrogance; goes to the hungry ghost realm but is endowed with merit; travels the paths of the form and formless realms but does not consider them superior.²

"Showing the practice of desire, yet separated from all attachment. Showing the practice of anger, yet having no aversion towards sentient beings. Showing the practice of ignorance, yet taming the mind with wisdom. Showing the practice of stinginess, yet giving away all internal and external possessions, not begrudging body or life. Showing the practice of breaking precepts, yet abiding peacefully in pure precepts, fearing even small faults. Showing the practice of anger [hatred], yet constantly compassionate and patient. Showing the practice of laziness, yet diligently cultivating merit. Showing the practice of distracted mind, yet constantly mindful and concentrated. Showing the practice of stupidity, yet penetrating worldly and supramundane wisdom.

"Showing the practice of flattery and deception, yet observing relationships with skillful means according to the scriptures. Showing the practice of arrogance, yet serving as a bridge for sentient beings. Showing the practice of all afflictions, yet the mind is constantly pure. Showing entry into the host of demons [*Māra*], yet conforming to Buddha-wisdom and not following other teachings. Showing entry into the śrāvaka [path], yet expounding unheard Dharma for sentient beings. Showing entry into the pratyekabuddha [path], yet achieving great compassion and converting sentient beings.

"Showing entry into poverty, yet having a jewel-hand,³ with inexhaustible merit. Showing entry into disability, yet possessing perfect marks and characteristics to adorn oneself. Showing entry into low status, yet born into the Buddha-family, endowed with merit. Showing entry into weakness/ugliness, yet obtaining the Nārāyaṇa-body,⁴ delightful to all beings. Showing entry into old age and sickness, yet eternally cutting off the root of sickness and transcending the fear of death.

"Showing the possession of livelihood, yet constantly observing impermanence and truly having no greed. Showing the possession of wives, concubines, and waiting women, yet constantly distanced from the mud of the five desires. Manifesting dullness, yet achieving eloquence and dhāraṇī without loss. Showing entry into heterodox paths, yet saving sentient beings with the orthodox path. Manifesting entry into all paths, yet cutting off their causes and conditions. Manifesting nirvāṇa, yet not cutting off birth and death.

"Mañjuśrī! If the bodhisattva can thus travel the non-path, this is called penetrating the Buddha Path."

---

## The Seed of the Tathāgata

Then Vimalakirti asked Mañjuśrī: "What is the seed (*gotra*) of the Tathāgata?"⁵

Mañjuśrī said: "The body is the seed. Ignorance and craving are the seed. Greed, anger, and delusion are the seed. The four inversions are the seed. The five hindrances are the seed. The six sense-entrances are the seed. The seven abodes of consciousness are the seed. The eight wrong constructs are the seed. The nine abodes of vexation are the seed. The ten unwholesome paths are the seed. To speak essentially: the sixty-two views and all afflictions (*kleśa*)—these are all the Buddha-seed."

He [Vimalakirti] asked: "What does this mean?"

He [Mañjuśrī] answered: "If one sees the unconditioned (*asaṃskṛta*) and enters the fixed determination [of the Arhat], one cannot generate the mind of *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*. For example, lotuses do not grow on the high plateau of dry land; they grow in the mud of the damp lowlands.⁶ Just so, one who sees the unconditioned dharma and enters fixed determination will never again happen to generate the Buddha-dharma. Only within the mud of afflictions do sentient beings raise the Buddha-dharma!

"Again, like planting seeds in the sky—they will never grow. Only in manure-enriched earth can they flourish. Like this, one who enters the unconditioned fixed determination does not generate the Buddha-dharma. One who gives rise to the view of self as great as Mount Sumeru can still generate the mind of *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi* and produce the Buddha-dharma!

"Therefore, you should know that all afflictions are the seed of the Tathāgata. For example, if one does not descend into the great ocean, one cannot obtain the priceless pearl. Like this, if one does not enter the great ocean of afflictions, one cannot obtain the jewel of All-Knowledge (*sarvajñā*)."

---

## Mahākāśyapa's Lament

At that time, Mahākāśyapa praised this, saying: "Excellent, excellent, Mañjuśrī! You speak these words well. Truly, as you say, the dusty laborers [those with afflictions] are the seed of the Tathāgata. We today are no longer capable of generating the mind of *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*. Even those with the five deadly sins can still generate the intention to produce the Buddha-dharma, but we will eternally be unable to generate it.

"For example, like a person with damaged faculties, for whom the five desires yield no benefit; likewise, the śrāvakas who have cut off bonds have no further benefit in the Buddha-dharma and eternally have no aspiration. Therefore, Mañjuśrī! The ordinary person has a reversibility in the Buddha-dharma, but the śrāvaka does not. Why? Upon hearing the Buddha-dharma, the ordinary person can raise the unexcelled Way-mind and not cut off the Three Jewels. Even if the śrāvaka hears the Buddha-dharma, the powers, and fearlessnesses until the end of their life, they can never generate the unexcelled Way-intention."

---

## The Bodhisattva's Family

At that time, a bodhisattva in the assembly named Universal Manifestation of Physical Form asked Vimalakirti: "Layman! Who are your parents, wife and children, relatives, retinue, officials, and acquaintances? Where are your pages, maids, elephants, horses, and carriages?"

Then Vimalakirti answered with verses:⁷

" Wisdom-perfection (*prajñā-pāramitā*) is the Bodhisattva’s Mother,
Skillful means (*upāya*) is the Father;
All the Guides of the multitude (Buddhas)
Are born from nothing other than these.

Dharma-joy is the wife,
Compassion (*karuṇā*) and kindness (*maitrī*) are the daughters,
Good mind and sincerity are the sons,
Ultimate emptiness and tranquility is the house.

The dust of sensory objects are the disciples,
Turning according to will;
The factors of awakening (*bodhipakṣika-dharma*) are the good friends,
By these one achieves Correct Awakening.

The paramitas are the Dharma-companions,
The four means of attraction (*saṃgraha-vastu*) are the dancing girls,
Singing and chanting Dharma-words,
Using this for music.

The garden is Retention (*dhāraṇī*),
The forest trees are the taintless (*anāsrava*) dharmas,
The flowers are the seven branches of awakening,
The fruit is the wisdom of liberation.

The bathing pool is the Eight Liberations,
Filled with the clear water of concentration (*samādhi*),
Scattered with the seven pure flowers,⁸
Bathing this stainless person.

Elephants and horses are the five penetrations galloping,
The Great Vehicle (*Mahāyāna*) is the carriage,
Controlled by the one mind,
Roaming the Eightfold Noble Path.

Dignified appearance consists of the marks,
The secondary marks adorn the form,
Shame (*hrī*) and scruple (*apatrāpya*) are the upper content,
Deep mind (*adhyāśaya*) is the garland.

Wealth consists of the Seven Dharma Treasures,
Teaching and instructing essentially increases interest,
Practicing according to what is said,
Merit-transfer (*pariṇāmanā*) is the great profit.

The four dhyānas are the seat/bed,
Born from pure livelihood,
Much learning (*bāhuśrutya*) increases wisdom,
This is the sound of self-awakening.

The food is the ambrosia of Dharma,
The drink is the flavor of liberation,
The bath is the pure mind,
Ranking discipline (*śīla*) is the unguent.

Destroying the thief of afflictions,
Heroic vigor none can surpass,
Subduing the four kinds of Māra,
The victory banner establishes the Way-place (*bodhimaṇḍa*).

Though knowing no arising or cessation,
Showing existence for their sake;
Totally manifesting in all lands,
Like the sun which is seen everywhere.

Offering to the Buddhas of the ten directions,
Immeasurable millions of Tathāgatas,
Between the Buddhas and oneself,
There is no thought of distinction.

Though knowing Buddha-lands
And sentient beings are empty,
Constantly cultivating the Pure Land,
Teaching and converting the multitude.

Whatever types of sentient beings,
Shapes, sounds, and deportments,
The fearless-power Bodhisattva,
Can manifest them all at once.

Awakening to the affairs of Māra,
Yet manifesting behavior that follows them;
With the wisdom of skillful means,
Able to appear perfectly at will.

Sometimes showing old age, sickness, death,
To accomplish sentient beings;
Understanding visions as illusory,
Penetrating without obstruction.

Sometimes manifesting the aeon-ending fire,
Heaven and earth entirely ablaze,
For the multitudes who possess the thought of permanence,
Illuminating to make them know impermanence.

Countless millions of beings,
All come to invite the Bodhisattva,
Arriving at his house at one time,
He transforms them to the Buddha-Way.

Scriptures, spells, and magic arts,
Technical skills and all arts,
Fully manifesting the practice of these things,
To bring benefit to the multitudes.

All the Daoist/worldly methods of the world,
Renouncing the home life within them all,
Using this to untie people's confusion,
While not falling into wrong views.

Sometimes serving as Sun, Moon, Heaven,
Brahma King, or World Lord (Indra),
Sometimes serving as Earth or Water,
Or again serving as Wind or Fire.⁹

During aeons of sickness and plague,
Manifesting as medicinal herbs,
If there are those who take them,
Sickness is removed and poison purged.

During aeons of famine,
Manifesting body as food and drink,
First saving them from hunger and thirst,
Then speaking Dharma to the people.

During aeons of swords and soldiers (war),
Generating kindness and compassion for them,
Transforming those sentient beings,
Causing them to dwell in the land of zero conflict.

If there are great battles,
Standing equal in strength to both sides,
The Bodhisattva manifests authority,
Subduing them to bring harmony and peace.

In all lands,
Wherever there are hells,
Instantly going to them,
Relieving their suffering and distress.

In all lands,
Where animals eat one another,
Manifesting birth there,
To create benefit for them.

Demonstrating the enjoyment of the five desires,
Also manifesting the practice of dhyāna,
Causing the devil's mind to be confused,
Unable to gain the advantage.

A lotus growing in the fire,
This can be called rare;
Practicing dhyāna while in desire,
Is rare just like this.

Sometimes manifesting as a prostitute,
Attracting those who love form (sex),
First hooking them with desire,
Later causing them to enter Buddha-wisdom.¹⁰

Sometimes serving as village magistrate,
Or as a guide for merchants,
National teacher and high minister,
To protect and benefit beings.

For those who are destitute,
Manifesting as an inexhaustible treasury,
Using this to encourage and guide,
Causing them to generate the Bodhi-mind.

For those whose minds are arrogant,
Manifesting as a powerful wrestler,
Subduing all haughtiness,
Causing them to dwell in the Unsurpassed Way.

For those multitudes who are fearful,
Standing before them to comfort,
First giving them fearlessness (*abhaya-dāna*),
Later causing them to generate the Way-mind.

Sometimes manifesting separation from desire,
Becoming a five-penetration sage (rishi),
Guiding the multitudes,
Causing them to dwell in precepts, patience, kindness.

Seeing those requiring service,
Manifesting as a servant/slave,
Once having pleased their mind,
Generating the Way-mind.

According to whatever they need,
Entering the Buddha-way,
With the power of skillful means,
Able to supply it all.

Like this the Way is immeasurable,
The practice has no boundary,
Wisdom has no limit,
Liberating countless multitudes.

Even if all Buddhas,
For immeasurable millions of aeons,
Praised his merit,
They could not exhaust it.

Who, hearing such Dharma,
Would not generate the Bodhi-mind?
Except for those unworthy people,
Those stupid, dark, and wisdom-less ones."

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Footnotes

1.  **Penetrate the Buddha Path**: *Buddha-mārga-avatāra*. The question sets up a paradox: usually one enters a path by following rules. Here, penetration comes from the "non-path" (*amārga*).
2.  **Not consider them superior**: The bodhisattva traverses all realms of existence, including hells and heavens, without attachment or judgment.
3.  **Jewel-hand**: Symbolizes the capacity to bestow spiritual wealth despite material poverty.
4.  **Nārāyaṇa-body**: A body as strong as Nārāyaṇa (a form of Vishnu/Hercules figure in Buddhism), representing physical resilience earned through merit.
5.  **Seed of the Tathāgata**: *Tathāgata-gotra*. Usually "seed" implies purity/Buddha-nature. Mañjuśrī radically redefines the seed as *defilement*. Without the manure of passion, the lotus of enlightenment cannot grow.
6.  **Mud of the damp lowlands**: A famous metaphor. The "high plateau" represents the sterile purity of the Arhat/Pratyekabuddha who has cut off desire. The "swamp" is the mess of samsara where Bodhisattvas thrive.
7.  **Verses**: These *gāthās* summarize the "Family of the Tathāgata," redefining worldly relations into spiritual qualities.
8.  **Seven pure flowers**: Often refers to the seven factors of awakening or seven constituents of the path.
9.  **Wind or Fire**: The Bodhisattva becomes the elements themselves to sustain life.
10. **Hooking them with desire**: *Upāya* logic. The "hook" (*agra*) draws beings in via their attachments, then transforms them.

### Definitions and Concepts

*   **Non-Path (Amārga)**: The paradoxical practice of delving into the profane (anger, greed, heresy) to transform it. It differs from indulgence because the bodhisattva maintains "mindful detachment" throughout.
*   **Sixty-two views**: The standard list of wrong views (eternalism, nihilism, etc.) regarding the self and the world found in the Brahma-jala Sutra.
*   **Gotra (Lineage/Seed)**: Mañjuśrī argues that the "lineage" of the Buddha is not the pious monk, but the passionate being who transmutes suffering into wisdom.

# Chapter 9: The Dharma-Door of Non-Duality (入不二法門品)

**Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel**

---

## The Bodhisattvas Speak

At that time, Vimalakirti spoke to the bodhisattvas: "Virtuous Ones! How does the bodhisattva enter the Dharma-door of non-duality (*advaya-dharma-paryāya*)? Let each speak according to what they prefer."

1.  **Dharma-Isvara (Dharma Sovereign)** said: "Virtuous Ones! Arising and Ceasing are two. The Dharma originally does not arise, and now it does not cease. Attaining this acceptance of non-arising (*anutpattika-dharma-kṣānti*) is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

2.  **Srigupta (Guardian of Virtue)** said: " 'I' and 'Mine' are two. Because there is 'I', there is 'Mine'. If there is no 'I', there is no 'Mine'. This is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

3.  **Animisa (Unblinking)** said: "Perception (*vedanā*) and non-perception are two. If dharmas are not perceived, they cannot be grasped. Because they cannot be grasped, there is no taking or rejecting, no fabrication and no activity. This is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

4.  **Devakuta (Incarnation of Virtue)** said: "Defilement (*mala*) and purity (*viśuddhi*) are two. Seeing the true nature of defilement, there is no mark of purity. Thus conforming to the mark of extinction is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

5.  **Sunetra (Good Eye)** said: "One mark (*ekalakṣaṇa*) and formlessness (*alakṣaṇa*) are two. If one knows that the one mark is precisely the formless, and one does not grasp the formless but enters into equality, this is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

6.  **Subahu (Wonderful Arm)** said: "The Bodhisattva-mind and the Śrāvaka-mind are two. Contemplating the characteristics of the mind as empty, like an illusion, there is no Bodhisattva-mind and no Śrāvaka-mind. This is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

7.  **Pusya** said: "Wholesome and Unwholesome are two. If one does not arouse wholesome or unwholesome, entering the limit of formlessness and penetrating it, this is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

8.  **Simha (Lion)** said: "Sin and Merit are two. If one penetrates the nature of sin (*pāpa*), it is not different from merit (*puṇya*). Using diamond-wisdom (*vajra-prajñā*) to definitively understand this characteristic, neither bound nor liberated, is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."¹

9.  **Simhamati (Lion Intention)** said: "Tainted (*sāsrava*) and Taintless (*anāsrava*) are two. If one attains the equality of dharmas, one does not generate the thought of tainted or taintless. Not adhering to characteristics, nor dwelling in formlessness—this is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

10. **Suddhadhimukti (Pure Understanding)** said: "Conditioned (*saṃskṛta*) and Unconditioned (*asaṃskṛta*) are two. If one separates from all enumeration, the mind is like empty space. Using pure wisdom without obstruction is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

11. **Narayana** said: "Worldly and Supramundane are two. The nature of the world is empty, which is precisely the supramundane. Within this, there is no entering, no exiting, no overflowing, no scattering. This is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

12. **Dantamati (Good Intention)** said: "Samsara and Nirvāṇa are two. If one sees the nature of Samsara, there is no Samsara. There is no bondage and no liberation, no burning and no extinction. Understanding in this way is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

13. **Pratyakshadharma (Manifest Sight)** said: "Exhaustible (*kṣaya*) and Inexhaustible (*akṣaya*) are two. Whether dharmas are ultimately exhausted or not exhausted, they constitute the mark of the inexhaustible. The mark of the inexhaustible is Emptiness (*śūnyatā*). Emptiness has no mark of exhaustible or inexhaustible. Entering in this way is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

14. **Parigupta (Universal Guardian)** said: "Self (*ātman*) and No-Self (*anātman*) are two. If the Self cannot be grasped, how can No-Self be grasped? One who sees the true nature of the self does not generate duality. This is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

15. **Vidyuddeva (Lightning God)** said: "Ignorance (*avidyā*) and Illumination (*vidyā*) are two. The true nature of ignorance is precisely illumination. Illumination also cannot be grasped. Separating from all numbers, equal and non-dual in the midst of this—this is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

16. **Priyadarsana (Joyful to See)** said: "Form (*rūpa*) and Emptiness of Form are two. Form is precisely emptiness; it is not that form is destroyed and then empty. The nature of form is itself empty. Likewise, feeling, perception, formation, and consciousness are two [vis-a-vis their emptiness]. Consciousness is precisely emptiness; it is not that consciousness is destroyed and then empty. The nature of consciousness is itself empty. Penetrating this is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

17. **Prabhaketu (Light Sign)** said: "The differentiation of the four elements and the differentiation of the emptiness-element are two. The nature of the four elements is precisely the nature of the emptiness-element. Just as the past and future are empty, the present is also empty. Being able to know the nature of the elements in this way is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

18. **Pramati (Superior Mind)** said: "Eye and Form are two. If one knows the nature of the eye, one is not greedy, angry, or deluded regarding form. This is called tranquil extinction. Likewise Ear/Sound, Nose/Smell, Tongue/Taste, Body/Touch, Mind/Dharma are two. If one knows the nature of the mind, one is not greedy, angry, or deluded regarding dharmas. This is called tranquil extinction. Abiding peacefully in this is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

19. **Akshayamati (Inexhaustible Mind)** said: "Giving (*dāna*) and Dedication (*pariṇāmanā*) to Omniscience are two. The nature of giving is precisely the nature of dedication to Omniscience. Likewise, Discipline, Patience, Vigor, Meditation, Wisdom, and Dedication to Omniscience are two. The nature of Wisdom is precisely the nature of dedication to Omniscience. Entering into single-characteristic within this is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

20. **Gambhiramati (Deep Wisdom)** said: "Emptiness, Signlessness, and Wishlessness are two [i.e., distinguished from each other]. Emptiness is Signlessness. Signlessness is Wishlessness. If it is Empty, Signless, and Wishless, then there is no Mind, Thought, or Consciousness. liberation in one door is liberation in three doors. This is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

21. **Santendriya (Quiet Roots)** said: "Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha are two. The Buddha is precisely the Dharma. The Dharma is precisely the Sangha. These Three Jewels represent the unconditioned characteristic, equal to empty space. All dharmas are also like this. Being able to practice according to this is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

22. **Apratihatacitta (Unobstructed Mind)** said: "Body and Body-Extinction are two. The body is precisely the extinction of the body. Why? One who sees the true characteristic of the body does not give rise to [views of] the body or the extinction of the body. Body and extinction of body are non-dual and undifferentiated. Not fearng or dreading this is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

23. **Suvinita (Well-Disciplined)** said: "Body, Speech, and Mind karma are two. All three karma have the characteristic of non-action (*akṛta*). The characteristic of body non-action is the characteristic of speech non-action. The characteristic of speech non-action is the characteristic of mind non-action. The characteristic of non-action of these three karmas is the characteristic of non-action of all dharmas. Being able to follow this wisdom of non-action is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

24. **Punyaksetra (Field of Merit)** said: "Meritorious action, Sinful action, and Immovable action are two. The true nature of the three actions is Empty. Emptiness has no meritorious action, sinful action, or immovable action. Not generating these three actions is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

25. **Padmavyuha (Flower Ornament)** said: "Generated from the Self creates duality. One who sees the true characteristic of the Self does not generate dualistic dharmas. If one does not dwell in dualistic dharmas, there is no consciousness. Being without consciousness is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

26. **Srigarbha (Virtue Store)** said: "Characteristics of attainment are two. If there is no attainment, there is no taking or rejection. Being without taking or rejection is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

27. **Candrottara (Moon Superior)** said: "Darkness and Light are two. If there is no darkness and no light, there is no duality. Why? Like entering the concentration of cessation (*nirodha-samāpatti*), there is no darkness and no light. The characteristics of all dharmas are likewise. Entering equally into this is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

28. **Ratnamudrahasta (Jewel-Seal Hand)** said: "Delighting in Nirvana and not delighting in the World are two. If one does not delight in Nirvana and does not treat the world with aversion, there is no duality. Why? If there is bondage, there is liberation. If fundamentally there is no bondage, who seeks liberation? Without bondage or liberation, there is no delight or aversion. This is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

29. **Maniratuakuta (Jewel Topknot King)** said: "The Right Path and the Wrong Path are two. One who abides in the Right Path does not discriminate 'this is wrong' or 'this is right'. Separating from these two is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

30. **Satyarata (Delighting in Truth)** said: "True and Untrue are two. One who sees Truly does not even see the True, how much less the Untrue? Why? It is not seen with the fleshly eye; only the Wisdom Eye can see it. But this Wisdom Eye has no seeing and no not-seeing. This is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

## Manjushri's Answer

After all the bodhisattvas had spoken, they asked Mañjuśrī: "What is the bodhisattva's entry into the Dharma-door of non-duality?"

Mañjuśrī said: "According to my intention, with regard to all dharmas, there are no words, no speech, no demonstration, and no cognition. It is separated from all questions and answers. This is entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

---

## The Thunderous Silence

Then Mañjuśrī asked Vimalakirti: "We have each spoken. Virtuous One, you should say: What is the bodhisattva's entry into the Dharma-door of non-duality?"

At that time, Vimalakirti remained silent and wordless.²

Mañjuśrī praised him, saying: "Excellent, excellent! Not to have even written words or language—this is truly entering the Dharma-door of non-duality."

When this 'Entry into the Dharma-Door of Non-Duality' chapter was expounded, five thousand bodhisattvas in the assembly all entered the Dharma-door of non-duality and attained the acceptance of non-arising dharmas.

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Footnotes

1.  **Sin and Merit are two**: Simha Bodhisattva attacks the fundamental dualism of religious ethics. Usually, Buddhism encourages merit (*puṇya*) and discourages sin (*pāpa*). From the absolute perspective of non-duality, both are karma-producing activities rooted in self-view.
2.  **Silent and wordless**: *The* defining moment of the Sutra. The 30 Bodhisattvas used words to describe non-duality (negation). Mañjuśrī used words to describe the absence of words (apophatic theology). Vimalakirti *demonstrates* non-duality by engaging in the act itself. Silence is not just the absence of speech, but the presence of the Absolute.

### Commentary

This chapter structurally resembles a dialectical staircase.
1.  **The Bodhisattvas (Negation of Opposites)**: 30 Bodhisattvas negate specific dualisms (good/bad, samsara/nirvana, self/other). This is the level of *intellectual understanding*.
2.  **Mañjuśrī (Negation of Language)**: Mañjuśrī moves to the meta-level. The problem isn't just specific opposites, but language itself. "No questions and answers." This is the level of *contemplative silence*.
3.  **Vimalakirti (The Absolute)**: Vimalakirti transcends the description of silence. He embodies the *reality* to which the silence points. As the Zen tradition later put it: "Mañjuśrī is the teacher of seven Buddhas, but he still can't beat Vimalakirti's shut mouth."

### Key Terms

*   **Advaya (Non-duality)**: Not "one" (monism), but "not two." It signifies the transcending of binary oppositions without collapsing into a homogenous blob. Samsara is Nirvana, not because they are the same thing, but because the discrimination between them is empty.
*   **Anutpattika-dharma-kṣānti (Acceptance of Non-arising)**: A high-level bodhisattva realization. The mind ceases to vibrate with hope and fear because it sees that no dharma has ever truly arisen or ceased.

# Chapter 10: Accumulated Fragrance (香積佛品)

**Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel**

---

## The Request for Food

At that time, Śāriputra thought to himself: "Mealtime is approaching. Where will these bodhisattvas eat?"

Vimalakirti, knowing his thought, said to him: "The Buddha has expounded the Eight Liberations. You, Virtuous One, have received them for practice. How can you mix the desire for food with listening to the Dharma? If you wish to eat, wait a moment. I will cause you to obtain a meal you have never had before."

Then Vimalakirti entered into samādhi and used his supernatural power to show the great assembly a world in the upward direction, passing through forty-two Ganges sands of Buddha-fields. There is a country named **Accumulated Fragrance** (*Gandhavyūha*). The Buddha is named **Fragrance Accumulation** (*Gandhottamakūṭa*), and he exists there now.¹ The fragrance of that country is supreme among all the fragrances of humans and devas in the worlds of the Buddhas of the ten directions.

In that land, there is not even the name of "Śrāvaka" or "Pratyekabuddha"; there is only the pure multitude of great Bodhisattvas, for whom the Buddha speaks the Dharma. In that realm, everything is built of fragrance: towers are made of fragrance, the ground for walking is fragrance, and the gardens are all fragrance. The aroma of their food flows pervasively through immeasurable worlds in the ten directions.

At that time, that Buddha and the bodhisattvas were sitting together eating. There were sons of gods, all named "Fragrance Adornment," who had all generated the mind of *anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi*, offering distinct alms to that Buddha and the bodhisattvas. Everyone in this [Vimalakirti's] assembly saw this.

Vimalakirti asked the host of bodhisattvas: "Virtuous Ones! Who can bring the rice of that Buddha?"

Because of Mañjuśrī's majestic supernatural power,² everyone remained silent.

Vimalakirti said: "Is this great assembly not ashamed?"

Mañjuśrī said: "As the Buddha has said, do not despise those who have not yet learned."

## The Emanated Bodhisattva

Then, without rising from his seat, Vimalakirti manifested a bodhisattva—whose marks and brilliance were majestic and superior, overshadowing the entire assembly—and told him: "Go in the upward direction. After passing forty-two Ganges sands of Buddha-fields, there is a country named Accumulated Fragrance. The Buddha is named Fragrance Accumulation. He is sitting and eating with the bodhisattvas. Go to where he is and, as I instruct, say: 'Vimalakirti bows his head at the World Honored One's feet, paying measureless respect and inquiring about your health: do you have little illness, little vexation, and is your strength at peace? He wishes to obtain the leftovers of the World Honored One's meal to perform Buddha-work in the Sahā world. This will cause those who delight in the petty Dharma to attain the Great Way, and will cause the name/reputation of the Tathāgata to be universally heard.'"

At that time, the Emanated Bodhisattva ascended upwards in front of the assembly. The whole crowd saw him go. He arrived at the Accumulated Fragrance world and bowed at that Buddha's feet. He repeated the words: "Vimalakirti bows his head at the World Honored One's feet... He wishes to obtain the leftovers of the World Honored One's meal..."

Those Great Beings [in that world] saw the Emanated Bodhisattva and praised this as unprecedented: "Where does this superior person come from? Where is the Sahā world? What is meant by 'those who delight in petty Dharma'?" They asked the Buddha.

That Buddha told them: "In the downward direction, passing forty-two Ganges sands of Buddha-fields, there is a world named Sahā. The Buddha is named Śākyamuni, and he exists now. In the midst of the Five Turbidities³ and the evil world, he expounds the Teaching of the Way for sentient beings who delight in the petty Dharma. There is a bodhisattva there named Vimalakirti, who dwells in the Inconceivable Liberation and speaks Dharma for the bodhisattvas. Therefore, he sent this emanation to praise my name and gaze upon this land, to cause those bodhisattvas to increase their merit."

Those bodhisattvas said: "What kind of person is he, to create such an emanation? His power of virtue and fearlessness, his spiritual feet behave like this!"

The Buddha said: "He is extremely great! In all ten directions, he sends emanations to perform Buddha-work and benefit sentient beings."

Then the Tathāgata Fragrance Accumulation filled a fragrant bowl with fragrant rice and gave it to the Emanated Bodhisattva.

At that time, nine million bodhisattvas [in that land] raised their voices together, saying: "We wish to go to the Sahā world to make offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha and to see Vimalakirti and the other bodhisattvas."

The Buddha said: "You may go. But retract your body-fragrance, so that the sentient beings there do not give rise to thoughts of attachment. Also, abandon your original forms, so as not to cause those in that country who seek the bodhisattva-[path] to feel self-shame. Also, do not harbor thoughts of contempt or obstruction regarding that land. Why? The lands of the ten directions are all like empty space. Also, the Buddhas, wishing to convert those who delight in the petty Dharma, merely do not completely manifest their pure lands."

## The Fragrant Meal

The Emanated Bodhisattva received the bowl of rice and, together with the nine million bodhisattvas—supported by the Buddha's majestic spirit and Vimalakirti's power—suddenly disappeared from that world and, in a moment, arrived at Vimalakirti's house.

Vimalakirti immediately manifested nine million lion-seats, majestic and fine as before, and the bodhisattvas all sat upon them. The Emanated Bodhisattva gave the bowl full of fragrant rice to Vimalakirti. The fragrance of the rice perfumed the entire city of Vaiśālī and the Triple Thousand Great Thousand Worlds.

At that time, the Brahmins and householders of Vaiśālī smelled this fragrance; their bodies and minds became blissful, and they praised it as unprecedented. The Elder Moon-Canopy (*Candracchatra*) came with 84,000 people to enter Vimalakirti's house. Seeing the many bodhisattvas in the room and the tall, wide, majestic lion-seats, they were all greatly delighted. They bowed to the bodhisattvas and great disciples and stood to one side. The Earth Gods, Sky Gods, and Devas of the Desire and Form realms, smelling this fragrance, also all came into Vimalakirti's house.

## Dharma-Food

Then Vimalakirti said to Śāriputra and the Great Śrāvakas: "Virtuous Ones, you may eat. This is the rice of the Tathāgata's ambrosia (*amṛta*), perfumed by Great Compassion. Do not eat it with a limited mind, or it will not be digested."

A certain Śrāvaka thought: "This rice is little, yet this great assembly is one where everyone must eat."

The Emanated Bodhisattva said: "Do not measure the Tathāgata's measureless merit and wisdom with the small virtue and small intelligence of a Śrāvaka! Even if the four seas were exhausted, this rice would be inexhaustible! If all people ate a lump the size of Mount Sumeru for an entire aeon, it would still not be exhausted. Why? Because it consists of surplus from the consumption of one possessing inexhaustible discipline, concentration, wisdom, liberation, and the knowledge-vision of liberation. It can never be exhausted."

Accordingly, the bowl of rice satisfied the entire assembly without being depleted. The bodhisattvas, śrāvakas, gods, and humans who ate this rice became physically comfortable and happy, just like the bodhisattvas of the Joyful Adornment world. Also, fine fragrance emanated from all their pores, just like the fragrance of the trees in the Accumulated Fragrance country.

## Teaching by Scent vs. Teaching by Words

Vimalakirti asked the Accumulated Fragrance Bodhisattvas: "How does the Tathāgata Fragrance Accumulation speak the Dharma?"

Those bodhisattvas said: "In our land, the Tathāgata does not use words or speech (*akṣara*). merely by means of the gathering of fragrances, human and devas obtain entry into the practice of discipline. The bodhisattvas sit individually beneath fragrant trees; smelling this fine fragrance, they immediately obtain the Samādhi of the Treasury of All Merit. Those who obtain this samādhi have all bodhisattva-merits completely fulfilled."⁴

Those bodhisattvas asked Vimalakirti: "How does the World Honored One Śākyamuni speak the Dharma?"

Vimalakirti said: "The sentient beings of this land are stubborn and difficult to convert. Therefore, the Buddha uses rigid and strong language to tame them. He says: 'This is hell. This is the animal realm. This is the hungry ghost realm. These are the places of difficulty. These are the places where fools are born.

"'This is bodily wrong action, this is the retribution for bodily wrong action. This is verbal wrong action... mental wrong action... This is killing... stealing... sexual misconduct... lying... double-tongued speech... harsh speech... frivolous speech... greed... anger... wrong view... stinginess... breaking precepts... laziness... distraction... stupidity.

"'This is keeping the precepts. This is breaking the precepts. This is what should be done. This is what should not be done. This is an obstruction. This is not an obstruction. This is incurring guilt. This is leaving guilt. This is pure. This is filthy. This is tainted (*sāsrava*). This is taintless. This is the wrong path. This is the right path. This is conditioned. This is unconditioned. This is the world. This is Nirvana.'

"Because the minds of people who are difficult to convert are like monkeys,⁵ he uses various kinds of Dharma to control their minds so they can be tamed. Like an elephant or horse that is stubborn and wild: one must apply sharp punishments until they pierce the bone, and only then are they tamed. Because these sentient beings are stubborn and difficult to convert, he uses all these bitter and cutting words to enable them to enter into discipline."

Those bodhisattvas, hearing this explanation, all said: "Unprecedented! The World Honored One Śākyamuni Buddha hides his measureless sovereign power and uses the method of poverty to save sentient beings. These bodhisattvas [here] are also capable of toil and humility, being born in this Buddha-land out of measureless Great Compassion."

Vimalakirti said: "The Great Compassion of the bodhisattvas of this land is firm, truly as you say. However, benefiting sentient beings for a single lifetime here is greater than practicing for a hundred thousand aeons in that [Fragrance] land. Why? This Sahā world has ten items of Good Dharma that other pure lands lack."

## The Ten Good Dharmas of the Sahā World

"What are the ten?
1.  Using giving (*dāna*) to gather the poor.
2.  Using pure precepts to gather those who break prohibitions.
3.  Using patience (*kṣānti*) to gather the angry.
4.  Using vigor (*vīrya*) to gather the lazy.
5.  Using meditation (*dhyāna*) to gather the distracted.
6.  Using wisdom (*prajñā*) to gather the foolish.
7.  Speaking the Dharma of removing difficulties to save those in the eight difficulties.
8.  Using the Mahāyāna Dharma to save those who delight in the Hīnayāna.
9.  Using various roots of goodness to relieve those without virtue.
10. Constantly using the Four Means of Attraction (*saṃgraha-vastu*) to accomplish sentient beings."

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Footnotes

1.  **Fragrance Accumulation (Gandhottamakūṭa)**: This Buddha-field represents a realm of purely aesthetic/sensory orientation. Unlike our world, where teaching is verbal/conceptual, there, teaching is olfactory and direct.
2.  **Mañjuśrī's supernatural power**: Vimalakirti implies that the silence of the bodhisattvas is due to Mañjuśrī's restraining influence, perhaps testing them or allowing the scene to unfold.
3.  **Five Turbidities (Pañca-kaṣāya)**: The characteristic marks of our degenerate age: turbidity of the aeon, of views, of afflictions, of sentient beings, and of lifespan.
4.  **Samādhi of the Treasury of All Merit**: The realization that sensory experience (smell), when purified of grasping, instantly conveys the totality of Buddhist practice.
5.  **Minds like monkeys**: *Kapicitta*. Identifying the restless, grasping nature of the human mind designated for verbal instruction.

### Definition of Dharma-Food

The concept of "Dharma-food" suggests that spiritual nourishment works physiologically as well as intellectually. In this chapter, the consumption of the "leftovers" of the Fragrance Buddha transforms the bodies of the Śrāvakas (who usually seek personal liberation) into bodies capable of generating Great Compassion. The "digestion" of this food is contingent on a "non-limited mind"—i.e., one must digest the concept of Emptiness to digest the ambrosia of the Tathāgata.

# Chapter 11: Bodhisattva Practices (菩薩行品)

**Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel**

---

## The Buddha's Audience

At that time, the Buddha was expounding the Dharma in the Āmrapālī Garden. Suddenly, the ground became vast and adorned, and the entire assembly turned golden-colored.

Ānanda asked the Buddha: "World Honored One! For what reason is there this auspicious sign? Why has this place suddenly become vast and adorned, and the entire assembly turned golden?"

The Buddha told Ānanda: "It is because Vimalakirti and Mañjuśrī, surrounded respectfully by a great multitude, generate the intention to come here; therefore, this auspicious sign appears first."

At that time, Vimalakirti said to Mañjuśrī: "We should go together to see the Buddha, to bow and make offerings."

Mañjuśrī said: "Excellent! Let us go! Now is exactly the right time."

Vimalakirti immediately used his supernatural power to hold the entire great multitude and the lion-seats in his right palm¹ and went to the Buddha's place. Upon arrival, he placed them on the ground. He bowed his head at the Buddha's feet, circumambulated him seven times to the right, put his palms together with single-mindedness, and stood to one side. The bodhisattvas immediately left their seats, bowed at the Buddha's feet, also circumambulated seven times, and stood to one side. The great disciples, Indra, Brahma, and the Four Heavenly Kings also left their seats, bowed at the Buddha's feet, and stood to one side.

Then the World Honored One comforted the bodhisattvas according to the Dharma and had them each sit down again; they all received his teaching. After the multitude was settled, the Buddha said to Śāriputra: "Did you see what the sovereign supernatural power of the Great Being (*Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva*) did?"

"Yes, indeed, I saw it!"

"What is your thought?"

"World Honored One! I see his actions as inconceivable. It is not what my mind can plan, nor what my calculation can measure."

## The Perfumed Assembly

At that time, Ānanda asked the Buddha: "World Honored One! The fragrance I smell now is one appearing for the first time since ancient days. What fragrance is this?"

The Buddha told Ānanda: "It is the fragrance from the pores of those bodhisattvas."

Then Śāriputra said to Ānanda: "Our pores are also emitting this fragrance!"

Ānanda said: "Where does it come from?"

[Śāriputra] said: "It is because the Elder Vimalakirti obtained the Buddha's leftover rice from the Accumulated Fragrance country and ate it in his house. Everyone's pores are fragrant like this."

Ānanda asked Vimalakirti: "How long will this fragrance last?"

Vimalakirti said: "Until this rice is digested."

"How long until the rice is digested?"

"The power of this rice lasts for seven days, and then it is digested. Furthermore, Ānanda! If a Śrāvaka who has not entered the Correct Position (*nyāma*) eats this rice, he will enter the Correct Position and then it will be digested. If he has already entered the Correct Position, he will obtain the liberation of mind, and then it will be digested. If one has not generated the Mahāyāna intent, eating this rice will cause him to generate the intent, and then it will be digested. If he has already generated the intent, he will obtain the Acceptance of Non-Arising (*anutpattika-dharma-kṣānti*), and then it will be digested. If he has already obtained the Acceptance of Non-Arising, he will reach the stage of being binding to only one more life (*eka-jāti-pratibuddha*), and then it will be digested. Like a medicine called 'Supreme Flavor'—if one takes it, all poisons in the body are destroyed, and only then is it digested. This rice is like this: it destroys the poison of all afflictions, and then it is digested."

Ānanda said to the Buddha: "Unprecedented, World Honored One! Such fragrant rice can perform Buddha-work."

The Buddha said: "It is so, it is so! Ānanda!
*   There are Buddha-lands that perform Buddha-work by means of Buddha-light.
*   There are those that perform Buddha-work by means of bodhisattvas.
*   There are those that perform Buddha-work by means of illusion-men created by the Buddha.
*   There are those that perform Buddha-work by means of the Bodhi tree.
*   There are those that perform Buddha-work by means of the Buddha's clothes and bedding.
*   There are those that perform Buddha-work by means of food and drink.
*   There are those that perform Buddha-work by means of gardens, terraces, and pavilions.
*   There are those that perform Buddha-work by means of the thirty-two marks and eighty secondary characteristics.
*   There are those that perform Buddha-work by means of the Buddha's body.
*   There are those that perform Buddha-work by means of empty space; sentient beings respond to this condition and enter the practice of discipline.
*   There are those that perform Buddha-work by means of metaphors like dreams, illusions, shadows, echoes, images in a mirror, the moon in water, and heat-mirages.
*   There are those that perform Buddha-work by means of sound, language, and words.
*   There are pure Buddha-lands that perform Buddha-work by means of silence, wordlessness, non-speaking, non-demonstration, non-cognition, non-doing, and non-action (*asamskrta*).

"Like this, Ānanda! Among the majestic ceremonies, movements, and activities of the Buddhas, there is nothing that is not Buddha-work.

"Ānanda! Although there are these four demons (*māras*) and 84,000 gates of affliction which tire out sentient beings, the Buddhas use these very Dharmas to perform Buddha-work. This is called entering the Dharma-door of all Buddhas. If a bodhisattva enters this door: seeing all pure and fine Buddha-lands, he does not delight, does not covet, and does not become arrogant. Seeing all impure Buddha-lands, he does not grieve, is not obstructed/vexed, and does not sink down. He merely generates a pure mind towards the Buddhas, rejoicing and respectful, thinking 'Unprecedented!'

"The merit of the Buddhas and Tathāgatas is equal. In order to convert sentient beings, they manifest different Buddha-lands. Ānanda! You see the lands of the Buddhas; the ground has various differences, but the empty space has no various differences. Like this, although you see the color-bodies of the Buddhas have various differences, their unobstructed wisdom has no various differences."

## The Dharma of Exhaustible and Inexhaustible

At that time, the bodhisattvas from the Accumulated Fragrance world put their palms together and said to the Buddha: "World Honored One! When we first saw this land, we generated the thought of inferiority. Now we repent and blame ourselves, abandoning this mind. Why? The skillful means (*upāya*) of the Buddhas are inconceivable. In order to save sentient beings, they manifest different Buddha-countries according to what is appropriate. O World Honored One! We wish you to bestow a little Dharma [on us], so that when we return to that land we may remember the Tathāgata."

The Buddha told those bodhisattvas: "There is the liberation Dharma-door of the **Exhaustible** and **Inexhaustible** (*kṣayākṣaya-vimokṣa*). You should learn this.

"What is meant by **Exhaustible**? It means **Conditioned Dharmas** (*saṃskṛta*).
"What is meant by **Inexhaustible**? It means **Unconditioned Dharmas** (*asaṃskṛta*).
"The Bodhisattva does not exhaust the Conditioned, and does not dwell in the Unconditioned.

### Not Exhausting the Conditioned (The Bodhisattva's Engagement)

"What does it mean not to exhaust the Conditioned? It means:
*   Not separating from Great Kindness (*mahā-maitrī*), not abandoning Great Compassion (*mahā-karuṇā*).
*   Deeply generating the mind of Omniscience (*sarvajña*) and not forgetting it.
*   Teaching and converting sentient beings without ever growing weary.
*   Constantly being mindful of and practicing the Four Means of Attraction.
*   Protecting and upholding the True Dharma without sparing body or life.
*   Planting all roots of goodness without fatigue or disgust.
*   Will constantly abiding in the transfer of merit through skillful means.
*   Seeking Dharma without laziness, speaking Dharma without stinginess.
*   Deliberately entering birth-and-death (*samsara*) without fear.
*   Regarding all glory and disgrace with a mind free of worry or joy.
*   Not despising the unlearned, but respecting the learned as if they were Buddhas.
*   Causing those fallen into affliction to generate correct mindfulness.
*   Not valuing the joy of isolation/detachment; not attaching to one's own joy, but celebrating the joy of others.
*   While in the dhyānas, thinking of them as [suffering like] hell.²
*   While in birth-and-death, thinking of it as a garden/park.³
*   Seeing those who come seeking [help] and thinking of them as good teachers.
*   Giving up all possessions and thinking of it as possessing Omniscience.
*   Seeing those who break precepts and generating thoughts of salvation/protection.
*   Thinking of the Pāramitās as parents.
*   Thinking of the factors of the Way (*bodhipakṣika-dharma*) as relatives/retinue.
*   Practicing limitless giving to adorn one's own Buddha-land.
*   Using the sword of wisdom to destroy the thieves of affliction.
*   Using great vigor to subdue the armies of Māra.
*   Constantly seeking the wisdom of the thought-less Reality (*animitta-bhūtatā*).
*   Having few desires and knowing satisfaction regarding worldly dharmas.
*   Seeking supramundane dharmas without satisfaction.
*   Not abandoning worldly dharmas, yet not violating the rules of deportment.
*   Using supernatural wisdom (*abhijñā*) to guide sentient beings.
*   Remembering all hearing [of Dharma] without forgetting.

"Practicing such dharmas is called the Bodhisattva not exhausting the Conditioned."

### Not Dwelling in the Unconditioned (The Bodhisattva's Detachment)

"What does it mean that the Bodhisattva does not dwell in the Unconditioned?
*   He cultivates the learning of Emptiness, yet does not take Emptiness as a realization/witness (*sākṣāt-kriyā*).
*   He cultivates Signlessness and Wishlessness, yet does not take them as valid realization.
*   He cultivates Non-Arising, yet does not take Non-Arising as realization.
*   He observes Impermanence, yet does not weary of the roots of goodness.
*   He observes the Suffering of the world, yet does not hate birth-and-death.
*   He observes No-Self, yet instructs people tirelessly.
*   He observes Tranquil Extinction (*vyupaśama*), yet does not become eternally extinct.
*   He observes Distancing/Isolation, yet cultivates the good in body and mind.
*   He observes No-Return, yet returns to orient towards Good Dharmas.
*   He observes Unconditioned, yet does not cut off the connection to Conditioned Dharmas.
*   He observes the position of the True Dharma,⁴ yet does not follow the Hīnayāna.

"Because he is endowed with merit, he does not dwell in the Unconditioned. Because he is endowed with wisdom, he does not exhaust the Conditioned.
"Because of Great Kindness and Compassion, he does not dwell in the Unconditioned. Because he fulfills his original vows, he does not exhaust the Conditioned.
"Because he gathers the Dharma-medicine, he does not dwell in the Unconditioned. Because he dispenses medicine according to [needs], he does not exhaust the Conditioned.
"Because he knows the sicknesses of sentient beings, he does not dwell in the Unconditioned. Because he cures the sicknesses of sentient beings, he does not exhaust the Conditioned.

"Virtuous Ones! The Bodhisattva who cultivates this Dharma does not exhaust the Conditioned and does not dwell in the Unconditioned. This is called the Exhaustible-Inexhaustible Liberation Dharma-door. You should learn this."

## Return of the Bodhisattvas

At that time, those [Accumulated Fragrance] Bodhisattvas, hearing this Dharma, were all greatly delighted. They scattered various fine flowers of different colors and scents throughout the Triple Thousand Great Thousand World, making offerings to the Buddha, this Sutra-Dharma, and the Bodhisattvas. They bowed at the Buddha's feet, praised it as unprecedented, and said: "The Śākyamuni Buddha is indeed able to perform good skillful means in this place."

Having spoken thus, they suddenly disappeared and returned to that country.

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Footnotes

1.  **Right palm**: Vimalakirti shrinks the massive assembly into his hand. This plays with the spatial relativity introduced in earlier chapters.
2.  **Thinking of dhyānas as hell**: A shocking statement aimed at preventing attachment to meditative bliss (*dhyāna-sukha*). For a Bodhisattva, getting stuck in a trance is as bad as being in hell because it prevents serving others.
3.  **Thinking of birth-and-death as a garden**: *Samsara* is not a prison to escape, but a playground for saving beings. This is the definition of "Playful Samādhi" (*vikrīḍita*).
4.  **Position of the True Dharma**: *Nyāma*. Usually refers to the irreversible state of the Arhat. The Bodhisattva stands on the brink of this "extinction" but refuses to fall into it.

### Concepts

*   **Exhaustible (Kṣaya)**: Refers to *saṃskṛta* (conditioned existence, samsara, building karma/merit).
*   **Inexhaustible (Akṣaya)**: Refers to *asaṃskṛta* (unconditioned, nirvana, emptiness).
*   **The Middle Way**: The standard Hīnayāna goal is to "exhaust" the conditioned and "enter" the unconditioned. The Mahāyāna goal is to keep the conditioned running (to generate merit/save beings) while having the wisdom of the unconditioned (to not be trapped). This dynamic tension is the heart of the "Bodhisattva Practice."

# Chapter 12: Seeing Akshobhya Buddha (見阿閦佛品)

**Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel**

---

## Viewing the Tathāgata

At that time, the World Honored One asked Vimalakirti: "You wish to see the Tathāgata. How do you view the Tathāgata?"

Vimalakirti said: "Just as I view the true characteristic (*bhūta-lakṣaṇa*) of my own body, so I view the Buddha.
"I view the Tathāgata as not coming from the past, not going to the future, and not abiding in the present.
"I do not view form (*rūpa*), nor the suchness of form, nor the nature of form.
"I do not view feeling, perception, formation, or consciousness; nor the suchness of consciousness, nor the nature of consciousness.
"He does not arise from the four great elements (*mahābhūta*); he is the same as empty space.
"He has no accumulation of the six entrances (*āyatana*); eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, and mind have already passed.
"He is not in the Three Realms (*triloka*); the three defilements are already separated.
"He accords with the Three Gates of Liberation (*vimokṣa-mukha*).
"He possesses the Three Illuminations (*vidyā*), yet is equal to ignorance (*avidyā*).¹
"He is not a unitary characteristic, not a different characteristic. Not a self-characteristic, not an other-characteristic. Not without characteristic, not grasping characteristic.
"Not this shore, not the other shore, not the middle flow—yet he converts sentient beings.
"I view him in tranquil extinction (*nirvana*), yet he is not eternally extinct.
"Not this, not that; not by means of this, not by means of that.
"He cannot be known by intellect (*jñāna*), cannot be recognized by consciousness (*vijñāna*).
"No obscurity, no brightness. No name, no sign. No strength, no weakness. Neither pure nor defiled.
"Not in a place, not apart from a place. Neither conditioned (*saṃskṛta*) nor unconditioned (*asaṃskṛta*). No demonstrating, no speaking.
"Not giving, not stinging. Not precept-keeping, not violating. Not patient, not angry. Not energetic, not lazy. Not concentrated, not scattered. Not wise, not foolish. Not sincere, not deceptive.
"No coming, no going. No exiting, no entering. All paths of language are cut off.
"He is not a field of merit (*puṇyakṣetra*), nor is he not a field of merit. He is not worthy of offerings, nor is he not worthy of offerings.²
"Neither grasping nor abandoning. Neither having characteristics nor lacking characteristics.
"He is the same as the True Limit (*bhūtakoṭi*), equal to the Dharma-Nature (*dharmatā*).
"He cannot be weighed, cannot be measured; he surpasses all weighing and measuring.
"Neither large nor small. Neither seeing nor hearing, neither feeling nor knowing. Separated from all knots and bonds.
"Equal to all wisdoms, same as all sentient beings, having no discrimination regarding all dharmas.
"Everything without loss, without turbidity, without distress, without doing, without arising, without birth, without extinction.
"No fear, no worry, no joy, no disgust, no attachment.
"No existence in the past, no existence in the future, no existence in the present.
"He cannot be displayed by any distinct speech.
"World Honored One! The body of the Tathāgata is like this. To perform such a viewing is called Correct Viewing (*samyag-darśana*). If one views otherwise, it is called Deviant Viewing."

## Origin of Vimalakirti

At that time, Śāriputra asked Vimalakirti: "Where did you die to come be born here?"

Vimalakirti said: "Does the Dharma you have attained have death and birth?"

Śāriputra said: "There is no death or birth."

"If all dharmas have no characteristic of death or birth, why do you ask: 'Where did you die to come be born here?' What do you think? It is like a magician who conjures an illusion of a man or woman—do they die and are they born?"

Śāriputra said: "There is no death or birth."

"Have you not heard the Buddha say that all dharmas are like illusion-characteristics?"

"Yes."

"If all dharmas are like illusion-characteristics, why do you ask: 'Where did you die to come be born here?' Śāriputra! 'Death' is a method of emptiness and deception, a characteristic of decay. 'Birth' is a method of emptiness and deception, a characteristic of continuity. Although the Bodhisattva dies, he does not exhaust his roots of goodness. Although he is born, he does not nurture evils."

At that time, the Buddha told Śāriputra: "There is a country called **Wonderful Joy** (*Abhirati*). The Buddha is named **Akshobhya** (Immovable). Vimalakirti died in that country and came to be born here."

Śāriputra said: "Unprecedented! World Honored One! This person is able to abandon a pure land (*sukhāvatī*) and come to delight in this place of much anger and harm."

Vimalakirti said to Śāriputra: "What do you think? When the sunlight comes out, does it unite with the darkness?"

"No. When the sunlight comes out, the darkness is gone."

Vimalakirti said: "Why does the sun travel to Jambudvīpa (the Human World)?"

"It wishes to illuminate it with brightness, to remove the darkness for its sake."

Vimalakirti said: "The Bodhisattva is like this. Although he is born in an impure Buddha-land, it is for the sake of converting sentient beings, therefore he does not unite with the darkness of ignorance. He merely destroys the darkness of the sentient beings' afflictions!"

## The Immovable Buddha

At that time, the great assembly thirstily admired (*tṛṣṇā-adhimukti*), wishing to see the World of Wonderful Joy, the Tathāgata Akshobhya, and his multitude of bodhisattvas and śrāvakas.

The Buddha, knowing the thoughts of the entire assembly, said to Vimalakirti: "Good man! For the sake of this assembly, manifest the World of Wonderful Joy, the Tathāgata Akshobhya, and the bodhisattvas and śrāvakas. Everyone wishes to see them."

Then Vimalakirti thought: "I should, without rising from my seat, take the World of Wonderful Joy—with its Iron Ring Mountains, rivers, valleys, streams, oceans, springs, Mount Sumeru, sun, moon, stars, palaces of gods, dragons, spirits, and Brahma; together with the multitude of bodhisattvas and śrāvakas, the cities, towns, villages, men and women, big and small; even up to the Tathāgata Akshobhya, the Bodhi tree, and the wonderful lotus flowers—everything that performs Buddha-work in the ten directions.
"I shall maintain the three jeweled stairways from Jambudvīpa to the Tuṣita Heaven... I shall sever it with my right hand like a potter's wheel, bring it into this world, holding it like a garland of flowers, and show it to all the multitudes."

Thinking thus, he entered samādhi and manifested supernatural power. With his right hand, he severed the World of Wonderful Joy and placed it in this land.

Those bodhisattvas and śrāvakas [in Abhirati] who had obtained supernatural powers, along with other gods and humans, all cried out: "World Honored One! Who is taking me away? We wish for rescue and protection!"

The Buddha Akshobhya said: "It is not my doing. It is the doing of Vimalakirti's supernatural power." The others who had not obtained supernatural powers did not even perceive or know where they were going. Although the World of Wonderful Joy entered this land, it did not increase or decrease [in size], and this [Saha] world was not crowded or cramped; it was just as before.

At that time, Śākyamuni Buddha told the great assembly: "You should look closely at the World of Wonderful Joy, the Tathāgata Akshobhya, the adornments of his country, the pure conduct of the bodhisattvas, and the purity of the disciples."

They all said: "Yes, indeed, we have seen it."

The Buddha said: "If a bodhisattva wishes to obtain a pure Buddha-land like this, he should learn the path practiced by the Tathāgata Akshobhya."

When this World of Wonderful Joy appeared, 14 nayutas of people in the Saha world generated the mind of *Anuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi*, all vowing to be born in the World of Wonderful Joy. Śākyamuni Buddha immediately prophesied (*vyākaraṇa*): "You shall be born in that country."

Then, the World of Wonderful Joy, having finished its work of benefit in this land, returned to its original place. The whole assembly saw it.

### Footnotes

1.  **Equal to ignorance**: A radical non-dual statement. Enlightenment (*vidyā*) and ignorance (*avidyā*) are same in their ultimate nature (emptiness). If one sees them as different, one is still in duality.
2.  **Field of merit**: *Puṇyakṣetra*. Usually refers to Buddhas or Arhats; giving to them generates vast merit. Vimalakirti deconstructs this: the Buddha is beyond the duality of "worthy" or "unworthy."

### Concepts

*   **Akshobhya (Immovable)**: One of the oldest Buddhas in the Mahāyāna pantheon (often paired with Amitābha). His land, Abhirati (Wonderful Joy), represents the East. He strictly observes the monastic code and represents unshakeable determination.
*   **Abhirati vs. Sukhāvatī**: Unlike Amitābha's Western Paradise (which is easy to enter via faith), Akshobhya's Eastern Paradise requires strict morality and non-anger. It is "realist"—women there are still women (unlike in Sukhāvatī where they become men) but suffer no pain of childbirth.
*   **Potter's Wheel**: A common Indian metaphor for ease of rotation. Vimalakirti spins a galaxy as easily as a potter spins a wheel.

# Chapter 13: Dharma Offering (法供養品)

**Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel**

## Indra's Pledge

At that time, Śakra Devanāma Indra (King of Gods) spoke to the Buddha from within the great assembly: "World Honored One! Although I have heard hundreds of thousands of sutras from the Buddha and Mañjuśrī, I have never heard this inconceivable scripture of sovereign supernatural power and decisive reality.
"As I understand the meaning of what the Buddha has said, if there are sentient beings who hear this Sutra-Dharma, believe and understand it, receive and hold it, and read and recite it, they will surely obtain this Dharma without doubt. How much more so if they cultivate according to the teaching?
"Such a person closes the gates to all evil destinies and opens the gates to all good deeds. He is constantly protected and kept in mind by all Buddhas. He subdues heterodox teachings, destroys the enemies of Māra, cultivates Bodhi, sits peacefully in the Way-place (*bodhimaṇḍa*), and treads the path walked by the Tathāgata.
"World Honored One! If there are those who receive, hold, read, recite, and cultivate according to the teaching, I and my relatives will make offerings and serve them. Wherever this Sutra is located—whether in villages, cities, mountains, forests, or wilderness—I and my relatives will go to that place to listen to and receive the Dharma. I will cause those who do not yet believe to generate faith, and those who already believe, I will protect."

The Buddha said: "Excellent, excellent! Heavenly Emperor! It is as you say. I rejoice with you. This Sutra expounds the inconceivable *Anuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi* of the Buddhas of the past, future, and present. Therefore, Heavenly Emperor! If a good man or good woman receives, holds, reads, recites, and makes offerings to this Sutra, they are making offerings to the Buddhas of the past, future, and present.

"Heavenly Emperor! Suppose the Three Thousand Great Thousand World were filled with Tathāgatas, dense like sugarcane, bamboo, reeds, hemp, or forests. If a good man or good woman were to revere, honor, praise, and make offerings to them for a kalpa or less than a kalpa; and after those Buddhas entered extinction (*parinirvāṇa*), they erected seven-jeweled stupas for each one's full-body relics—stupas as wide as the Four Continents and as high as the Brahma Heaven, adorned with banners—and made offerings of flowers, incense, garlands, banners, and music for a kalpa or less than a kalpa.
"What do you think, Heavenly Emperor? Is the merit planted by this person great or not?"

Śakra Devanāma Indra said: "It is great, World Honored One! The merit of that person cannot be exhausted even if one spoke for hundreds of thousands of millions of kalpas."

The Buddha told the Heavenly Emperor: "You should know that if a good man or good woman hears this Inconceivable Liberation Scripture, believes, understands, receives, holds, reads, recites, and practices it, their merit is even greater than that.
"Why? Because the Bodhi of all Buddhas arises from this. The characteristic of Bodhi is immeasurable; therefore, the merit from this cause is also immeasurable."

## The Story of Medicine King and the Dharma Offering

The Buddha told the Heavenly Emperor: "In the past, countless Asamkhyeya kalpas ago, there was a Buddha named **Medicine King Tathāgata** (*Bhaiṣajyarāja*), Worthy of Offerings, Perfectly Enlightened...¹ His world was called Great Adornment (*Mahāvyūha*), and the kalpa was called Adornment. That Buddha's lifespan was twenty small kalpas.
"At that time, there was a Wheel-Turning Sage King (*Cakravartin*) named **Precious Canons** (*Ratnacchattra*), who possessed the seven jewels and ruled the Four Continents. The King had one thousand sons, upright and brave, capable of subduing enemies.

"At that time, Precious Canons and his relatives made offerings to Medicine King Tathāgata for five full kalpas. After five kalpas, he told his thousand sons: 'You should also, like me, make offerings to the Buddha with a deep mind.'
"The thousand sons obeyed their father's command and made offerings to Medicine King Tathāgata for another five full kalpas.
"One of the King's sons, named **Moon Canopy** (*Candracchattra*), sat alone and thought: 'Is there any offering that surpasses this?'
"By the Buddha's spiritual power, a deity in the sky said: 'Good man! The **Offering of Dharma** (*Dharma-pūjā*) surpasses all offerings.'
"He immediately asked: 'What is meant by the Offering of Dharma?'
"The deity said: 'You can go ask Medicine King Tathāgata; he will explain the Offering of Dharma to you in detail.'

"Prince Moon Canopy immediately went to Medicine King Tathāgata, bowed at his feet, stood to one side, and asked: 'World Honored One! Among all offerings, the Offering of Dharma is supreme. What is the Offering of Dharma?'

"The Buddha said: 'Good man! The Offering of Dharma is:
"Those profound sutras spoken by the Buddhas—difficult for the world to believe and accept, subtle and difficult to see, pure and undefiled, not obtainable merely by discriminative thinking.
"They are contained in the Bodhisattva's Dharma-Treasury and sealed by the Dhāraṇī-seal.
"They lead to the non-retrogressive stage, accomplish the Six Pāramitās, skillfully distinguish meanings, and accord with the Bodhi-Dharma.
"They are supreme among all sutras. They enter Great Compassion and Compassion, separating from all demonic affairs and deviant views.
"They accord with the law of causes and conditions (*pratītyasamutpāda*): no self, no person, no sentient being, no lifespan; empty, signless, wishless, and unarisen.
"They enable sentient beings to sit in the Way-place and turn the Dharma-wheel.
"They are praised by heavenly beings, dragons, spirits, and Gandharvas.
"They enable sentient beings to enter the Buddha's Dharma-Treasury and gather all the wisdom of the sages.
"They explain the path practiced by all Bodhisattvas.
"Relying on the meaning of the True Characteristic of all dharmas, they clearly proclaim the dharmas of impermanence, suffering, emptiness, no-self, and tranquil extinction.
"They can save all sentient beings who have broken the precepts; they can cause fear in all demons, heretics, and greedy attached ones.
"They are praised by all Buddhas and sages. They turn away from the suffering of birth-and-death and demonstrate the joy of Nirvana.
"They are spoken by the Buddhas of the ten directions and three times.

"If one hears sutras like these, believes, understands, receives, holds, reads, recites, and uses skillful means to explain and distinguish them clearly for sentient beings—guarding and protecting the Dharma—this is called the **Offering of Dharma**.

"Furthermore, practicing according to the teaching with regard to all dharmas, according with the Twelve Links of Origination, separating from deviant views, obtaining the Patience of Non-Arising (*anutpattika-dharma-kṣānti*), determining there is no self and no sentient being, yet having no contradiction or dispute regarding cause and effect...
"Relying on the **Meaning**, not the Word.
"Relying on **Wisdom**, not Consciousness.
"Relying on Sutras of **Definitive Meaning** (*nītārtha*), not Sutras of Provisional Meaning (*neyārtha*).
"Relying on the **Dharma**, not the Person.²
"According with the Dharma-characteristic (*dharmalakṣaṇa*), with no entry and no return. Because ignorance is ultimately extinguished, all formations are ultimately extinguished... up to birth being extinguished, old age and death are ultimately extinguished. Performing this observation of the Twelve Links: there is no characteristic of exhaustion, nor any arising of views. This is called the supreme Offering of Dharma.'"

## The Prophecy

The Buddha told the Heavenly Emperor: "Prince Moon Canopy heard this Dharma from Medicine King Buddha and obtained the Soft and Compliant Patience (*anulomikā-kṣānti*). He immediately took off his precious robes and ornaments to offer to the Buddha, saying: 'World Honored One! After the Tathāgata's extinction, I will perform the Dharma Offering and protect the True Dharma. May your majestic spirit support me to establish this, enabling me to subdue demon enemies and cultivate the Bodhisattva practice.'
"The Buddha knew his deep thought and prophesied: 'In the final age, you will protect the City of Dharma.'

"Heavenly Emperor! At that time, Prince Moon Canopy saw the purity of the Dharma and heard the Buddha's prophecy. With faith, he left the household life (*pravrajyā*) and cultivated the good roots. Before long, he obtained the Five Supernatural Powers, attained the Bodhisattva Way, and obtained Dhāraṇī and unobstructed eloquence.
"After that Buddha's extinction, using his powers of supernatural penetration, total recall (*dhāraṇī*), and eloquence, he distributed the Dharma-wheel turned by Medicine King Tathāgata for ten small kalpas.
"Monk Moon Canopy, by protecting the Dharma and practicing diligently, caused one million billion people to stand irreversibly in *Anuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi* in that very body; fourteen nayutas of people generated the minds of Śrāvakas and Pratyekabuddhas; and immeasurable sentient beings were born in the heavens.

"Heavenly Emperor! Was that King Precious Canons a different person? He is now the Buddha **Precious Flame** (*Ratnārcis*). His thousand sons are the thousand Buddhas of this Virtuous Kalpa (*Bhadrakalpa*)—starting from Krakucchanda Buddha and ending with Rucika Buddha.
"And make no mistake: **Monk Moon Canopy was I, myself.**

"Thus, Heavenly Emperor! You should know this essential point: The Offering of Dharma is supreme, greatest, and incomparable among all offerings. Therefore, Heavenly Emperor! You should make offerings to the Buddha by means of the Offering of Dharma."

### Concepts

*   **Dharma Offering (Dharma-pūjā)**: The central argument of this chapter. Material offerings (*āmiṣa-pūjā*)—flowers, stupas, money—yield finite merit because the objects are finite. Offering the Dharma (by teaching it or practicing it) yields infinite merit because the Dharma is infinite (unconditioned).
*   **Protection of Dharma**: The truest protection is not building walls around scriptures, but embodying their meaning ("practicing according to the teaching").

# Chapter 14: Entrusting (囑累品)

**Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel**

---

## The Buddha Entrusts to Maitreya

At that time, the Buddha addressed the Bodhisattva Maitreya:¹ "Maitreya! I now entrust to you the Dharma of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*² that I have gathered over immeasurable millions of asaṃkhyeya kalpas.³ Such sūtras as this, in the final age after the Buddha's parinirvāṇa,⁴ you and your kind should use supernatural power to widely proclaim and circulate them throughout Jambudvīpa.⁵ Do not let them be cut off.

"Why is this so? In future ages, there will be good men and good women,⁶ as well as devas, nāgas, spirits, gandharvas, and rakṣasas,⁷ who generate the mind of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi* and delight in the great Dharma.⁸ If such sūtras are not heard, they will lose this excellent benefit.⁹

"When such people hear these sūtras, they will certainly believe and delight in them greatly, generating a rare aspiration.¹⁰ They should receive them with the crown of their heads.¹¹ According to what benefits sentient beings are fit to receive, broadly explain for them."¹²

---

## Two Characteristics of Bodhisattvas

"Maitreya! You should know: bodhisattvas have two characteristics.¹³ What are the two?

"First, they delight in elaborate phrases and literary adornment.¹⁴

"Second, they do not fear profound meaning and can truly enter it.¹⁵

"Those who delight in elaborate phrases and literary adornment—know that these are new-learner bodhisattvas.¹⁶ Those who, regarding such undefiled, unattached, extremely profound sūtras,¹⁷ have no fear, can enter them, and upon hearing purify their minds,¹⁸ accepting, upholding, reading, reciting, and practicing as taught—know that these are long-practiced in the path.¹⁹

---

## Two Dharmas Hindering New Learners

"Maitreya! There are another two dharmas that cause those called new learners to be unable to determine regarding profound Dharma.²⁰ What are the two?

"First, having never heard profound sūtras before, when they hear them they are startled, doubt, and cannot follow.²¹ They slander and do not believe, saying: 'I have never heard this before—from where has it come?'²²

"Second, if there are those who protect, uphold, and explain such profound sūtras, they refuse to approach, serve, or revere them.²³ Sometimes they speak of their faults.²⁴

"Having these two dharmas, know that this is a new-learner bodhisattva, who injures himself²⁵ and cannot, in profound Dharma, train his mind."²⁶

---

## Two Dharmas Hindering Progress

"Maitreya! There are another two dharmas: although a bodhisattva believes and understands profound Dharma, he still injures himself and cannot attain the patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas.²⁷ What are the two?

"First, slighting new-learner bodhisattvas and not teaching them.²⁸

"Second, although understanding profound Dharma, yet grasping at characteristics and making discriminations.²⁹

"These are the two."³⁰

---

## Maitreya's Response

When the Bodhisattva Maitreya heard this, he said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! Unprecedented! As the Buddha has taught, I shall distance myself from such evils³¹ and uphold the Dharma of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi* that the Tathāgata has gathered over countless asaṃkhyeya kalpas.³²

"If in future ages there are good men and good women who seek the Mahāyāna,³³ I shall cause them to obtain such sūtras in their hands.³⁴ I shall give them the power of mindfulness, enabling them to accept, uphold, read, recite, and broadly explain to others.³⁵

"World-Honored One! If in the final age there are those who can accept, uphold, read, recite, and explain for others,³⁶ know that these are all established through Maitreya's supernatural power."³⁷

---

## The Buddha's Approval

The Buddha said: "Excellent, excellent! Maitreya! As you have said, the Buddha rejoices with you."³⁸

---

## All Bodhisattvas Vow

At that time, all the bodhisattvas joined palms and said to the Buddha: "We also, after the Tathāgata's parinirvāṇa, shall widely proclaim and circulate the Dharma of *anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi* throughout the lands of the ten directions.³⁹ We shall also guide those who teach the Dharma, enabling them to obtain this sūtra."⁴⁰

---

## The Four Heavenly Kings Vow

At that time, the Four Heavenly Kings⁴¹ said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! In all places—cities, villages, towns, mountain forests, or wilderness—wherever this sūtra-scroll exists, wherever it is read, recited, and explained,⁴² we shall lead our retinues there to hear the Dharma. We shall protect those persons, guarding them for a hundred yojanas in every direction,⁴³ not letting any who seek an opportunity against them find one."⁴⁴

---

## The Sūtra's Transmission

At that time, the Buddha addressed Ānanda: "Accept and uphold this sūtra and broadly circulate and proclaim it."⁴⁵

Ānanda said: "So be it! I have accepted and upheld its essentials.⁴⁶ World-Honored One! What should this sūtra be called?"⁴⁷

---

## The Name of the Sūtra

The Buddha said: "Ānanda! This sūtra is called 'The Teaching of Vimalakirti.'⁴⁸ It is also called 'The Dharma-Gate of Inconceivable Liberation.'⁴⁹ Thus should you accept and uphold it."⁵⁰

---

## The Conclusion

When the Buddha had finished teaching this sūtra, the elder Vimalakirti, Mañjuśrī, Śāriputra, Ānanda, and all the devas, humans, asuras, and the entire great assembly heard what the Buddha taught.⁵¹ All were greatly delighted.⁵²

### Key Concepts

**Entrusting to Maitreya**: The future buddha is charged with maintaining the teaching. This establishes a lineage of protection reaching into the Dharma-ending age.

**Two Types of Bodhisattvas**: Those attached to literary beauty versus those who enter profound meaning without fear. This diagnostic helps practitioners understand their own level.

**Four Self-Injuries**: 
1. Fear and rejection of profound sūtras
2. Avoiding and criticizing teachers
3. Slighting new learners
4. Grasping characteristics even while understanding

**The Two Names**: "The Teaching of Vimalakirti" (personal) and "The Dharma-Gate of Inconceivable Liberation" (doctrinal) together summarize the sūtra's character.
