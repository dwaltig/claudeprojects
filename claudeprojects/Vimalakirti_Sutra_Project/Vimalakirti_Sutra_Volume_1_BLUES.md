# Chapter 1: The Pure Land Blues

**Blues Translation by Master John Kim**

## How the Story Got Told

This is what I heard:

One time, the Boss¹ was staying in a mango grove near Vaiśālī, and he had a crowd with him—eight thousand monks and thirty-two thousand bodhisattvas.² Now these bodhisattvas, they weren't no beginners. They'd been walking this road a long time, and everybody knew their names. They had that deep wisdom, that fundamental practice all locked down. The buddhas themselves had set them up, made them strong. They were the ones protecting the Dharma, holding down the truth. When they spoke, it was like a lion's roar—you could hear it ten directions out. They didn't wait to be asked; they just came alongside folks and gave them comfort. They kept the Three Jewels³ going, made sure the Buddha, the Dharma, and the Sangha never died out. They'd beaten down the devil and all his tricks, put all them false teachers in their place, and they were clean—I mean really clean, free from all that mess that tangles people up. Their minds stayed steady in that freedom that ain't got no walls around it. They had mindfulness, concentration, that power to hold the teachings, and they could speak the truth without stumbling. Giving, keeping their word, patience, hard work, meditation, wisdom, and knowing how to meet folks where they are—they had all that down. They'd reached that place where they understood ain't nothing really being born or dying.⁴ They were turning that wheel that can't be turned back. They knew how the Dharma works, and they knew what folks needed. They covered the whole assembly with fearlessness, merit, and wisdom, and that's how they cultivated their minds. They had them marks on their bodies, them signs of all the good they'd done. They'd given up all the world's fancy dress. Their reputation was higher than the highest mountain. Their faith was solid as diamond. The Dharma-jewel shined out from them like light, raining down that sweet dew of truth. When they spoke, it was the most beautiful sound you ever heard. They'd gone deep into how everything depends on everything else, and they'd cut off all them wrong views—thinking things either exist forever or don't exist at all. They spoke the Dharma without fear, like that lion's roar. When they preached, it was like thunder rolling. They were beyond measure, past all measuring. They'd gathered up all the Dharma-jewels, like captains who know the ocean. They understood the deep meaning of all things. They knew where folks were coming from and where they were going, what their minds were up to. They were close to the Buddha's own wisdom, them ten powers, that fearlessness, them eighteen things only a buddha's got. They shut the gates to hell, but they showed up in all five realms⁵ to help folks. They were like the best doctors, healing every sickness, giving folks the medicine they needed and making sure they took it. They'd accomplished immeasurable merit; they'd purified immeasurable buddha-lands. Anybody who saw them or heard them got blessed. Nothing they did was wasted. All them merits—they had them all.

Their names were: Equal Vision, Unequal Vision, Equal-Unequal Vision, King of Concentration, King of Dharma, Dharma-Mark, Light-Mark, Light-Adornment, Great Adornment, Jewel-Accumulation, Eloquence-Accumulation, Jewel-Hand, Jewel-Seal-Hand, Constantly-Raised-Hand, Constantly-Lowered-Hand, Constant Sorrow, Joyful Root, Joyful King, Eloquent Voice, Space-Treasury, Jewel-Torch-Bearer, Jewel-Courage, Jewel-Vision, Indra's Net, Bright Net, Unconditioned Contemplation, Wisdom-Accumulation, Jewel-Victory, Heavenly King, Māra-Destroyer, Lightning-Virtue, Sovereign King, Merit-Mark-Adornment, Lion's Roar, Thunder-Sound, Mountain-Striking-Sound, Fragrant Elephant, White Fragrant Elephant, Constant Vigor, Never Resting, Wonderful Birth, Flower Adornment, Observer of the World's Sounds,⁶ Great Strength, Brahmā's Net, Jewel-Staff, Invincible, Land-Adorner, Golden Topknot, Pearl Topknot, Maitreya,⁷ and Mañjuśrī⁸—thirty-two thousand of them all told.

And there were ten thousand Brahmā-kings who'd come from other worlds to hear the teaching. Twelve thousand Śakras⁹ came too, from other worlds, to sit in the assembly. And all them other powerful beings—gods, dragons, spirits, musicians, titans, bird-spirits, horse-headed singers, great serpents—they all came to sit down. The monks, the nuns, the laymen, the laywomen—everybody came. The Buddha was surrounded by this immeasurable crowd, hundreds of thousands of them, all showing respect, and he was teaching them the Dharma. He was like that great mountain rising up out of the ocean, sitting on his lion-throne all decorated with jewels, outshining everybody there.

## The Young Man's Offering

Now at that time, in the city of Vaiśālī, there was this young man, son of an elder, name of Jewel-Accumulation. He came to see the Buddha with five hundred other young men, all of them carrying these jeweled canopies. They bowed down at the Buddha's feet, and each one offered up their canopy to worship him. And through the Buddha's spiritual power, all them canopies merged into one big canopy that covered the whole universe—I mean the whole trichiliocosm,¹⁰ billion worlds and all. You could see the whole thing in that canopy. All the mountains—Sumeru, the Snow Mountains, all of them—the oceans, rivers, streams, springs, the sun, moon, and stars, the palaces of the gods and dragons and spirits—all of it appeared in that jeweled canopy. And not just that—the buddhas of the ten directions and their teaching, that appeared in there too.

When everybody saw the Buddha's spiritual power, they sighed. They'd never seen nothing like it. They put their palms together, bowed to the Buddha, looked up at his face, and couldn't take their eyes off him. Then that young man Jewel-Accumulation spoke up in verse before the Buddha:

> "Your eyes are pure, long and wide like blue lotus flowers,  
> Your mind is pure, done crossed all them meditative states,  
> You been accumulating pure karma so long, they call it immeasurable,  
> Leading folks to that quiet place—to you I bow my head.  
>   
> We done seen the Great Sage's spiritual transformations,  
> Showing us immeasurable lands in all ten directions,  
> Where all them buddhas are teaching the Dharma—  
> In this, we see it all, we hear it all.  
>   
> The Dharma-King's Dharma-power goes beyond all beings,  
> Always giving out that Dharma-wealth to everybody,  
> Knowing how to tell the difference between all things,  
> But not moving when it comes to ultimate truth—  
> You got sovereignty over all dharmas,  
> That's why I bow to this Dharma-King.  
>   
> You teach the Dharma, not saying it exists or don't exist,  
> Through causes and conditions all things arise,  
> No self, no maker, nobody receiving,  
> But the karma of good and evil, that don't get lost.  
>   
> First at the Bodhi-tree, you beat down the devil with power,  
> Got that sweet dew's extinction, accomplished the enlightened Way,  
> Already without mind or thought, without grabbing or doing,  
> But you completely crushed all them false teachers.  
>   
> Three times you turned that Dharma-wheel in the great universe,  
> That wheel was pure from the beginning, always been pure,  
> Gods and humans getting the Way—that's the proof,  
> The Three Jewels showing up in the world.  
>   
> With this sublime Dharma you saving all beings,  
> Once they receive it, they don't fall back, stay quiet,  
> Crossing old age, sickness, and death—Great Physician-King,  
> We should bow to the Dharma-ocean's virtue that got no end.  
>   
> Praise or blame don't move you, like Mount Sumeru,  
> Toward good and not-good, you equal with compassion,  
> Your mind practicing equality like empty space—  
> Who gonna hear about this human jewel and not receive it with respect?  
>   
> Now I'm offering the World-Honored One this humble canopy,  
> And in it appears my whole universe,  
> The palaces where the gods, dragons, and spirits live,  
> The musicians and spirits too.  
>   
> Everything that exists in the world, we see it,  
> The Ten Powers showing this transformation out of compassion,  
> Everybody seeing what they never seen before, all praising the Buddha—  
> Now I bow to the Honored One of the Three Realms.  
>   
> The Great Sage Dharma-King, everybody returns to him,  
> With pure mind looking at the Buddha, everybody delighted,  
> Each one seeing the World-Honored One right in front of them—  
> This is spiritual power, one of them uncommon qualities.  
>   
> The Buddha speaks with one voice,  
> But sentient beings, according to their type, each one understands,  
> All of them thinking the World-Honored One speaks their language—  
> This is spiritual power, one of them uncommon qualities.  
>   
> The Buddha speaks with one voice,  
> But sentient beings, each according to their understanding,  
> All receiving it, practicing it, getting benefit—  
> This is spiritual power, one of them uncommon qualities.  
>   
> The Buddha speaks with one voice,  
> Some get fearful, some get joyful,  
> Some start letting go, some cut through their doubt—  
> This is spiritual power, one of them uncommon qualities.  
>   
> I bow to the Ten Powers' great vigor,  
> I bow to those who got fearlessness,  
> I bow to those living in them uncommon qualities,  
> I bow to all the great guides,  
> I bow to those who can cut all bondage,  
> I bow to those who done reached the other shore,  
> I bow to those who can ferry all worlds,  
> I bow to those forever free from the road of birth and death.  
>   
> Knowing completely where sentient beings coming from and going to,  
> Skillful in all dharmas, getting liberation,  
> Not attached to the world like a lotus flower,  
> Always and skillfully entering that practice of emptiness and quiet,  
> Understanding the characteristics of all dharmas without obstruction—  
> I bow to you, like space, without no dependence."

## The Teaching on Pure Lands

After that young man Jewel-Accumulation spoke them verses, he said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One, these five hundred young men, they all done generated that mind of supreme enlightenment.¹¹ They want to hear how to get a pure buddha-land. We're praying that the World-Honored One will explain what bodhisattvas got to do to purify lands!"

The Buddha said: "Excellent, Jewel-Accumulation! You asking the Tathāgata on behalf of the bodhisattvas about how to purify lands. Listen careful, listen careful! Think well on this, and I'm gonna explain it for you!" So Jewel-Accumulation and them five hundred young men received the teaching and listened.

The Buddha said: "Jewel-Accumulation! The various classes of sentient beings—they ARE the bodhisattva's buddha-land.¹² Why's that? A bodhisattva takes a buddha-land according to the sentient beings he transforms. A bodhisattva takes a buddha-land according to the sentient beings he tames. A bodhisattva takes a buddha-land according to what land sentient beings need to enter the Buddha's wisdom. A bodhisattva takes a buddha-land according to what land sentient beings need to wake up them bodhisattva faculties. Why's that? When a bodhisattva takes a pure land, it's entirely for the sake of benefiting all sentient beings. It's like a person who wants to build a palace on empty ground—he can do it however he wants, ain't nothing in the way. But if he tries to build it in empty space, he'll never get it done! Bodhisattvas are like this: in order to accomplish sentient beings, they vow to take a buddha-land. Vowing to take a buddha-land ain't building in emptiness.

"Jewel-Accumulation! You should know: An upright mind¹³ is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings who don't flatter and lie will be born in his land. A profound mind is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings full of merit will be born in his land. The mind of bodhi¹⁴ is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, Mahāyāna sentient beings will be born in his land. Giving is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings who can let go of everything will be born in his land. Keeping the precepts is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings practicing the ten wholesome actions and fulfilling their vows will be born in his land. Patience is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings adorned with them thirty-two marks will be born in his land. Hard work is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings diligently cultivating all merits will be born in his land. Meditation is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings with collected and undistracted minds will be born in his land. Wisdom is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings in right concentration will be born in his land. The four immeasurables¹⁵—loving-kindness, compassion, joy, and letting folks be—that's the bodhisattva's pure land. When the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings accomplished in these will be born in his land. The four ways of attracting folks¹⁶—giving, kind speech, helpful conduct, and working together—that's the bodhisattva's pure land. When the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings embraced by liberation will be born in his land. Skillful means is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings who ain't obstructed in skillful means regarding all dharmas will be born in his land. The thirty-seven factors of enlightenment¹⁷ are the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings practicing mindfulness, right effort, spiritual power, faculties, powers, enlightenment factors, and path-factors will be born in his land. Dedicating merit is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, he'll get a land full of all merits. Teaching folks how to avoid the eight difficulties¹⁸ is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, his land will be free from the three evil paths and the eight difficulties. Guarding your own conduct without criticizing others' faults is the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, his land won't even have a name for breaking the rules. The ten wholesome actions are the bodhisattva's pure land—when the bodhisattva becomes a buddha, sentient beings whose lives ain't cut short, who are wealthy, who practice pure conduct, whose words are true, who always use gentle speech, whose relatives don't separate, who skillfully make peace in disputes, whose words necessarily benefit, who ain't jealous, ain't angry, and hold right views will be born in his land.

"So, Jewel-Accumulation! According to a bodhisattva's upright mind, he's able to generate practice. According to his generating practice, he gets a profound mind. According to his profound mind, his intention becomes tamed. According to the taming of his intention, he practices what he preaches. According to practicing what he preaches, he's able to dedicate merit. According to his dedication, he has skillful means. According to his skillful means, he accomplishes sentient beings. According to accomplishing sentient beings, the buddha-land becomes pure. According to the purity of the buddha-land, the Dharma-teaching becomes pure. According to the purity of Dharma-teaching, wisdom becomes pure. According to the purity of wisdom, the mind becomes pure. According to the purity of mind, all merits become pure. Therefore, Jewel-Accumulation! If a bodhisattva wants to get a pure land, he should purify his mind. According to the purity of his mind, the buddha-land becomes pure."¹⁹

## Śāriputra's Doubt and the Buddha's Response

At that time, Śāriputra,²⁰ empowered by the Buddha's spiritual power, had this thought: "If when a bodhisattva's mind is pure, the buddha-land becomes pure, then when our World-Honored One was formerly practicing as a bodhisattva, was his intention not pure? But this buddha-land is impure like this!"

The Buddha, knowing his thought, immediately said to him: "What you think? Are the sun and moon not pure, but the blind don't see them?"

He replied: "No, World-Honored One! This is the blind person's fault, not the fault of the sun and moon."

"Śāriputra! Because of sentient beings' transgressions, they don't see the Tathāgata's buddha-land's magnificent purity—it ain't the Tathāgata's fault. Śāriputra! This land of mine is pure, but you don't see it."

At that time, the Brahmā-king Spiral-Topknot said to Śāriputra: "Don't have that thought, thinking this buddha-land is impure. Why's that? I see Śākyamuni Buddha's land as pure, like the palace of the highest heaven."

Śāriputra said: "I see this land full of hills, valleys, pits, thorns, sand, gravel, earth, stone mountains, and filth."

The Brahmā-king Spiral-Topknot said: "Venerable one, your mind has highs and lows and don't rely on the Buddha's wisdom, that's why you see this land as impure! Śāriputra! Bodhisattvas are completely equal toward all sentient beings, their profound minds pure, relying on the Buddha's wisdom—then they're able to see this buddha-land as pure."

Then the Buddha pressed the earth with his toe, and immediately the whole universe was adorned with hundreds of thousands of jewels, like the Land of Immeasurable Merit and Jewel Adornment of the Buddha Jewel-Banner. The whole assembly sighed at this unprecedented marvel, and everybody saw themselves sitting on jeweled lotus flowers.

The Buddha told Śāriputra: "You see now this buddha-land's magnificent purity?"

Śāriputra said: "Indeed so, World-Honored One! What I never seen before, never heard before, the buddha-land's magnificent purity now all appears."

The Buddha said to Śāriputra: "My buddha-land is always pure like this. In order to save inferior people, I show this land full of various evils and impurities! It's like when the gods eat from jeweled vessels—according to their merit, the color of the food is different. Likewise, Śāriputra! If a person's mind is pure, he then sees this land's meritorious adornment."

When the Buddha showed this land's magnificent purity, them five hundred young men led by Jewel-Accumulation all got that patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas,²¹ and eighty-four thousand persons all generated the mind of supreme enlightenment. The Buddha withdrew his spiritual powers, and then this world went back to how it was before. Those seeking the Śrāvaka vehicle—thirty-two thousand gods and humans—knowing that conditioned dharmas are all impermanent, became far from dust and free from defilement, getting the pure Dharma-eye.²² Eight thousand monks, not grasping any dharmas, exhausted the outflows and liberated their minds.²³

## Endnotes

¹ **The Boss**: The Buddha. In the Blues tradition, "the Boss" or "the Man" refers to the ultimate authority, but here it's used with deep respect for the one who shows the way.

² **Bodhisattvas**: Folks on the road to becoming buddhas, but they ain't just walking for themselves—they walking for everybody. They vowed to get everybody across before they rest.

³ **Three Jewels**: The Buddha (the one who woke up), the Dharma (the truth he taught), and the Sangha (the community walking the path). These are what you take refuge in.

⁴ **Ain't nothing really being born or dying**: This is that deep realization that all things are empty of inherent existence. When you see this, you understand that birth and death are just appearances, not ultimate reality. The Blues knows about this—how suffering and joy both pass, how ain't nothing permanent to hold onto.

⁵ **Five realms**: Hell, hungry ghosts, animals, humans, and gods. Bodhisattvas show up in all of them to help folks, even though they're free and don't have to.

⁶ **Observer of the World's Sounds**: Avalokiteśvara, the bodhisattva of compassion. Hears every cry for help and responds. The Blues understands this—somebody listening to your trouble, somebody who hears.

⁷ **Maitreya**: The future buddha. He's coming when the time is right, when this dispensation is done.

⁸ **Mañjuśrī**: The bodhisattva of wisdom. Got that sword that cuts through ignorance. He's gonna be Vimalakirti's main conversation partner in this sutra.

⁹ **Śakras**: Indras, kings of the gods. Twelve thousand of them from different worlds, showing how vast this assembly was.

¹⁰ **Trichiliocosm**: A billion-world system. When the Blues talks about the universe, it's talking BIG. This ain't just our little world—it's everything.

¹¹ **Supreme enlightenment**: *Anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi*. The highest awakening, what a buddha attains. These young men done set their hearts on it.

¹² **CENTRAL TEACHING - Sentient beings ARE the bodhisattva's buddha-land**: This is revolutionary. The pure land ain't some place far away you go to after you die. The pure land is made by purifying sentient beings. The land's purity depends on the people's purity, and the people's purity depends on the bodhisattva's practice. This means you can't separate the environment from the folks in it. You can't separate your practice from helping others. The Blues knows this—you can't get free by yourself. Your freedom is tied up with everybody else's freedom.

¹³ **Upright mind**: Being straight with folks, no flattery, no lying, no games. Just honest, sincere, straightforward. That's the foundation.

¹⁴ **Mind of bodhi**: The aspiration to wake up for the sake of all beings. This is what makes you a bodhisattva—not just wanting to get free yourself, but wanting everybody to get free.

¹⁵ **Four immeasurables**: Loving-kindness (wanting everybody to be happy), compassion (wanting everybody to be free from suffering), sympathetic joy (being happy when others are happy), and equanimity (letting folks be, not trying to control everything). These attitudes extend boundlessly to all beings.

¹⁶ **Four ways of attracting folks**: Giving (being generous), kind speech (talking gentle), helpful conduct (doing what benefits others), and working together (cooperating, being part of the team). This is how bodhisattvas draw folks to the Dharma.

¹⁷ **Thirty-seven factors of enlightenment**: The complete set of practices leading to awakening. Mindfulness, right effort, spiritual power, faculties, powers, enlightenment factors, and the eightfold path. All of it together.

¹⁸ **Eight difficulties**: Eight conditions that make it hard to encounter the Dharma: being born in hell, as a hungry ghost, as an animal, in a long-lived heaven, in a border region, with impaired faculties, with wrong views, or in a time without a buddha.

¹⁹ **CENTRAL TEACHING - According to the purity of mind, the buddha-land becomes pure**: This is the heart of it. The external world reflects the internal mind. You want a pure land? Purify your mind. This ain't just about perception—it's about how mind and world ain't two separate things. The Blues understands this deeply. The world you see is the world you make. Your inner state creates your outer reality. Clean up your heart, and you clean up your world.

²⁰ **Śāriputra**: One of the Buddha's foremost disciples, known for his wisdom. But in Mahāyāna sutras, he often represents the limited Śrāvaka perspective that needs to be transcended. He's looking for personal liberation, not understanding the bodhisattva's vision yet.

²¹ **Patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas**: A high bodhisattva attainment—direct realization that all phenomena are empty and don't truly arise. Once you get this, you ain't turning back.

²² **Pure Dharma-eye**: The first stage of realization in the Śrāvaka path, seeing the truth of the Four Noble Truths and entering the stream to nirvāṇa.

²³ **Exhausted the outflows and liberated their minds**: Complete arhatship—freedom from all mental defilements and liberation from rebirth. They done finished the work.

### Theological Notes

**The Pure Land Ain't Somewhere Else**: This chapter teaches that pure lands ain't external paradises you escape to. They arise from the bodhisattva's practice of purifying sentient beings. The land's purity is the people's purity. This is different from the devotional Pure Land schools that emphasize rebirth in Amitābha's Sukhāvatī through faith. The Vimalakirti Sutra says: you want a pure land? Get to work purifying beings. Your environment is your practice.

**Mind and World Ain't Two**: The teaching that "according to the purity of mind, the buddha-land becomes pure" shows that consciousness and environment ain't separate. This is the non-duality that's central to this whole sutra. The Blues knows this truth—the world you see depends on where you're standing, what you're carrying, how clear your vision is.

**Skillful Means**: The Buddha explains that he shows an impure land to save "inferior people." This is skillful means—adapting the teaching to folks' capacity. The same reality looks different depending on your spiritual development. This ain't deception; it's compassionate adaptation. The Blues does this too—meeting folks where they are, speaking their language.

**Bodhisattva Path vs. Personal Liberation**: The chapter contrasts the bodhisattva ideal (represented by them 32,000 bodhisattvas and Jewel-Accumulation) with the Śrāvaka path (represented by Śāriputra). Both get liberation, but bodhisattvas work to purify lands and save beings, while śrāvakas seek personal nirvāṇa. The Blues is with the bodhisattvas on this—you can't get free alone. Your liberation is bound up with everybody else's.

## The Man Called Vimalakirti

Now at that time, in the great city of Vaiśālī, there was this elder named Vimalakirti.¹ He'd already made offerings to more buddhas than you could count, had planted them wholesome roots deep,² and had gotten that patient acceptance—knowing ain't nothing truly being born or dying.³ His tongue was free, couldn't nobody tie it up; he played with spiritual powers⁴ like a child plays with toys and had acquired all them dhāraṇīs.⁵ He had fearlessness, had beat down the devil and all his forces. He'd entered them deep Dharma-gates, was skillful in that perfection of wisdom,⁶ and had completely mastered skillful means.⁷ His great vows were accomplished. He clearly understood how folks' minds tend—where they going, what they wanting. And he could distinguish the sharp from the dull, who was ready and who wasn't. Long time he'd been walking the Buddha-road, his mind already ripe and resolved,⁸ his decision fixed on the Great Vehicle. Whatever he did, he reflected skillfully. He dwelt in the Buddha's deportment, his mind vast as the ocean. All the buddhas praised him; he was revered by disciples, Śakra, Brahmā, and the world-protectors.⁹

Now in order to save beings, he used skillful means to reside in Vaiśālī. His wealth was immeasurable, and he used it to embrace the poor. His discipline was pure, and through this he embraced those who'd broken the precepts. Through patient endurance and regulated conduct, he embraced those prone to anger. Through great vigor, he embraced the lazy. Through one-pointed meditative quiescence,¹⁰ he embraced those with scattered minds. Through decisive wisdom, he embraced the ignorant.

Though he was a layman wearing white robes,¹¹ he kept the pure discipline of a śramaṇa.¹² Though living the householder's life, he wasn't attached to the three realms.¹³ Though appearing to have a wife and children, he constantly cultivated pure conduct.¹⁴ Though appearing to have a household full of relatives, he constantly delighted in solitude. Though wearing precious ornaments, he adorned his body with the marks and characteristics.¹⁵ Though eating and drinking,¹⁶ he relished the flavor of meditation's joy. If he went to gambling halls and gaming houses, he used it solely to save beings. He received the teachings of various non-Buddhist paths without losing his true faith. Though well-versed in worldly texts, he constantly delighted in the Buddha-Dharma. He was revered by all who saw him, as the highest among those to be honored. Managing all commerce and trade, though he got worldly profit, he didn't take no delight in it.¹⁷

Traveling through the four main streets, he benefited sentient beings. Entering the halls of government, he protected all.¹⁸ Entering the places of debate, he led them with the Great Vehicle. Entering the schools, he enlightened the children.¹⁹ Entering the houses of prostitution, he revealed the misery of desire. Entering the wine houses, he could establish their resolve.

When among the elders, he was the most honored among elders, expounding the supreme Dharma. When among householders, he was the most honored among householders, cutting off their attachments. When among the warriors,²⁰ he was the most honored among warriors, teaching them patience. When among the priests,²¹ he was the most honored among priests, eliminating their pride. When among ministers, he was the most honored among ministers, teaching them the true Dharma. When among princes, he was the most honored among princes, revealing loyalty and filial piety. When among palace officials, he was the most honored among palace officials, transforming the court women. When among common people, he was the most honored among common people, causing them to cultivate merit. When among Brahmā-devas, he was the most honored among Brahmā-devas, instructing them in supreme wisdom. When among Śakra, he was the most honored among Śakras, manifesting impermanence. When among the world-protectors, he was the most honored among world-protectors, protecting all sentient beings.

That's how the elder Vimalakirti, using these immeasurable skillful means, benefited sentient beings.

## Getting Sick for a Reason

Using these skillful means, he made it look like his body was sick.²² Because he was "sick," kings, great ministers, elders, householders, priests, and the rest—including princes and various officials, an uncountable multitude of thousands—all came to ask about his illness.

To them that came, Vimalakirti, using his bodily illness, extensively preached the Dharma:

"Benevolent ones! This body is impermanent,²³ without strength, without power, without solidity, a thing that decays fast—you can't trust it!²⁴ It's the source of suffering and affliction, where all diseases gather. Benevolent ones! This kind of body, the wise don't rely on.

"This body is like a mass of foam—you can't grab hold of it.²⁵ This body is like a bubble—it can't last long.²⁶ This body is like a mirage—born from thirst and craving.²⁷ This body is like a plantain tree—at the core ain't nothing solid.²⁸ This body is like an illusion—arising from mental inversion.²⁹ This body is like a dream—seen as a false vision. This body is like a shadow—appearing from karmic conditions.³⁰ This body is like an echo—depending on causes and conditions. This body is like a floating cloud—changing and dissolving in an instant.³¹ This body is like lightning—not staying even for one thought-moment.³²

"This body don't have a permanent master—it's like the earth.³³ This body don't have a self—it's like fire.³⁴ This body don't have longevity—it's like the wind.³⁵ This body don't have a person—it's like water.³⁶ This body ain't real—the four great elements are its home.³⁷ This body is empty—separate from 'I' and 'mine.'³⁸ This body ain't got awareness—like grass, trees, tiles, and pebbles. This body ain't got agency—it's turned by the power of the wind.³⁹ This body ain't clean—filled with filth and corruption.⁴⁰ This body is falsity—though you bathe it, clothe it, and feed it, it's bound to decay. This body is a disaster—afflicted by a hundred and one illnesses.⁴¹ This body is like an old well—pressed upon by age.⁴² This body got no fixed term—it's gonna die for sure.⁴³ This body is like a venomous snake, like a hateful thief, like an empty village—it's a composite of the aggregates, realms, and sense-bases.⁴⁴

## The Buddha-Body

"Benevolent ones! This body should be despised and wearied of. You should take joy in the Buddha-body.⁴⁵ Why's that? The Buddha-body IS the Dharma-body.⁴⁶ It's born from immeasurable merit and wisdom. It's born from discipline, concentration, wisdom, liberation, and liberation-knowledge-and-vision.⁴⁷ It's born from loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, and equanimity.⁴⁸ It's born from giving, discipline, patience, gentleness, diligent vigor, concentration, liberation, samādhi, learning, and the wisdom of the pāramitās.⁴⁹ It's born from skillful means. It's born from the six spiritual penetrations.⁵⁰ It's born from the three insights.⁵¹ It's born from the thirty-seven factors of enlightenment.⁵² It's born from cessation and contemplation.⁵³ It's born from the ten powers, four fearlessnesses, and eighteen unique qualities.⁵⁴ It's born from cutting off all unwholesome dharmas and gathering all wholesome dharmas. It's born from reality. It's born from non-negligence.⁵⁵

"From such immeasurable pure dharmas the Tathāgata's body is born. Benevolent ones! If you want to get the Buddha-body, to cut off the illnesses of all sentient beings, you should generate the mind of supreme enlightenment.⁵⁶"

That's how the elder Vimalakirti, according to the occasion, preached the Dharma to them who came to ask about his illness, causing countless thousands of folks to generate the mind of supreme enlightenment.

## Endnotes

¹ **Vimalakirti**: Means "Stainless Reputation" or "Pure Fame." He's a wealthy householder, a layman, not a monk. This is revolutionary—the Mahāyāna is saying awakening ain't just for folks who left the world. Vimalakirti is in the world but not of it. He got a wife, kids, wealth, business—and he's more awake than the Buddha's direct disciples. The Blues understands this. You don't have to escape to be free.

² **Planted them wholesome roots deep**: Means he's been cultivating goodness for countless lifetimes. Non-greed, non-hatred, non-delusion—these are the roots of all virtue. Vimalakirti's got them deep.

³ **Ain't nothing truly being born or dying**: This is that patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas. When you see emptiness directly, you understand birth and death are just appearances. The Blues knows this truth in its bones—everything passes, but in that passing is freedom.

⁴ **Played with spiritual powers**: The word "play" (遊戲) is important. Vimalakirti don't use his powers to impress or control. He uses them like a child at play—freely, without attachment. The powers serve compassion, not ego.

⁵ **All them dhāraṇīs**: Mystical formulas that encapsulate teachings. Having all of them means complete mastery of the Dharma.

⁶ **Perfection of wisdom**: *Prajñā-pāramitā*. The crowning perfection—insight into the empty, interdependent nature of all things. This is what cuts through delusion.

⁷ **Skillful means**: **THIS IS THE KEY THEME OF THIS CHAPTER.** *Upāya-kauśalya*. It means knowing how to adapt the teaching to the capacity of the student. It means meeting folks where they are. The Blues is all about skillful means—taking ancient truth and putting it in a form that speaks to people today, in their own language. Vimalakirti enters gambling halls, brothels, wine houses—not to partake but to teach. Every situation becomes an opportunity for liberation.

⁸ **Mind already ripe and resolved**: Means he's been walking this road so long, he's ready. His practice is mature, his resolve is firm.

⁹ **World-protectors**: The four guardian kings who protect the Dharma. Even they revere Vimalakirti.

¹⁰ **Meditative quiescence**: Deep, peaceful states of concentration where the mind becomes still and clear.

¹¹ **Wearing white robes**: Standard term for a layperson. Monks wore colored or patched robes; layfolk wore white. The whole description that follows contrasts Vimalakirti's external appearance as a worldly man with his internal realization as an awakened being.

¹² **Śramaṇa**: A religious renunciant, a monk. Vimalakirti keeps the monastic discipline while living as a householder. He's got the inner form without the outer form.

¹³ **Three realms**: The desire realm, form realm, and formless realm—the whole cosmos of rebirth. Vimalakirti lives in the world without being caught by it.

¹⁴ **Pure conduct**: Traditionally means celibacy (brahmacarya). But here it means that even while appearing to have a wife and family, Vimalakirti maintains the purity of one who's transcended desire. His family life is a teaching tool, not a compromise.

¹⁵ **Marks and characteristics**: The thirty-two major marks and eighty secondary characteristics of a buddha. Vimalakirti's real adornment is spiritual radiance, not jewelry.

¹⁶ **Eating and drinking**: He participates in worldly meals, but his true nourishment is the joy of meditation. This anticipates Chapter 10 on the Fragrant Buddha's land, where food itself becomes a teaching.

¹⁷ **Didn't take no delight in it**: This is key. Vimalakirti engages fully in commerce without attachment to profit. This is the spirituality of the marketplace. You can work in the world without being enslaved to worldly gain. The Blues knows about making a living while keeping your soul.

¹⁸ **Halls of government**: Vimalakirti enters political spaces to protect beings. Governance can be a field for bodhisattva practice.

¹⁹ **Enlightened the children**: Education as skillful means. Leading the young out of ignorance.

²⁰ **Warriors**: The kṣatriya caste. Teaching them patience addresses their tendency toward violence. Everyone gets the teaching they need.

²¹ **Priests**: The brahmin caste. Teaching them to eliminate pride addresses their tendency toward spiritual arrogance. Vimalakirti prescribes according to the illness.

²² **CENTRAL TEACHING - Made it look like his body was sick**: This is the chapter's key move. Vimalakirti ain't really sick—he's manifesting sickness as a skillful means. By getting "sick," he creates an occasion for all these important people to come visit, and then he teaches them. His "illness" mirrors the illness of all beings stuck in delusion. The Blues knows about using your suffering to teach. Your wounds become your wisdom. What breaks you open can be what wakes you up.

²³ **Impermanent**: The first mark of existence. The whole teaching that follows systematically exposes the body's lack of permanence, strength, power, and solidity—all the things we mistakenly think it has.

²⁴ **Can't trust it**: The body is unreliable because it's conditioned. This echoes the Buddha's last words: "Conditioned things decay. Work out your liberation with diligence." The body will let you down.

²⁵ **Like a mass of foam**: From the *Phena Sutta*, where the Buddha compares the five aggregates to foam, bubbles, mirages, plantains, and illusions. When you really look at foam, you realize there's nothing to grab onto. That's the body.

²⁶ **Like a bubble**: Water bubbles arise and burst instantly. The body is that temporary.

²⁷ **Like a mirage**: Born from heat and thirst. Our sense of having a substantial self arises from craving (*taṇhā*). It's a trick of perception born from desire.

²⁸ **Like a plantain tree**: When you peel a plantain tree layer by layer, you find no solid core. Same with the body—analyze it into its parts and there's no self to find.

²⁹ **Like an illusion from mental inversion**: The four inversions are seeing permanence in the impermanent, pleasure in suffering, self in the selfless, and purity in the impure. Our sense of self arises from these cognitive distortions.

³⁰ **Like a shadow appearing from karmic conditions**: The body is a projection of past karma, not an independent thing. It's the shadow cast by your actions.

³¹ **Like a floating cloud**: Clouds transform and disperse moment by moment. They got no stable essence. Neither does the body.

³² **Like lightning**: Most transient of all—lightning exists less than a moment. The phrase "not staying even for one thought-moment" points to the doctrine of momentariness: even in what seems like a single moment, the body is constantly perishing and arising. The Blues understands this impermanence deep in its bones.

³³ **Like the earth, without a permanent master**: The four elements analysis—the body is made of earth (solidity), water, fire, and wind. The earth element in your body ain't yours—it just follows natural laws. Nobody's in charge.

³⁴ **Like fire, without a self**: The fire element (heat, digestion) operates without any agent directing it.

³⁵ **Like the wind, without longevity**: The breath, the vital wind—it's gonna stop. There's no permanent life-force.

³⁶ **Like water, without a person**: The fluid elements in the body don't make a "person." It's just water doing what water does.

³⁷ **The four great elements are its home**: Earth, water, fire, wind—these impersonal elements are temporarily combined to form the body. But there's no self living inside them. The home is empty.

³⁸ **Separate from 'I' and 'mine'**: The core teaching of *anātman*—no self. The body contains neither a self nor anything belonging to a self. When you really see this, you're free.

³⁹ **Turned by the power of the wind**: The body moves not by personal will but by causal forces. What you think is voluntary action is just elements in motion. This challenges our deepest sense of being an agent.

⁴⁰ **Filled with filth and corruption**: The meditation on the thirty-two impure parts of the body, intended to counteract attachment. Not pretty when you look close.

⁴¹ **A hundred and one illnesses**: Traditional expression for all the diseases that afflict the body.

⁴² **Like an old well**: An old well that's run dry, pressed down by age—can't nourish you no more.

⁴³ **Gonna die for sure**: The body's only certainty is death. "No fixed term" means it could be today. The Blues don't sugar-coat this.

⁴⁴ **Composite of aggregates, realms, and sense-bases**: This is technical Buddhist phenomenology—the five aggregates (*skandha*), eighteen realms (*dhātu*), twelve sense-bases (*āyatana*). These are overlapping classification systems for experience. The body is nothing but these components briefly combined—no self can be found anywhere in them. The "empty village" image appears in the Pāli texts as a metaphor for the selfless body.

⁴⁵ **Take joy in the Buddha-body**: Now the teaching pivots. We've been despising the conditioned body so we can aspire to something beyond it. But this ain't escapism—the Buddha-body is realized right here, through transformation, not abandonment.

⁴⁶ **CENTRAL TEACHING - The Buddha-body IS the Dharma-body**: This is huge. The Buddha's true body ain't physical form—it's reality itself, it's the Dharma. This teaching develops later into the three-body (*trikāya*) doctrine: the dharma-body (truth), the enjoyment-body (for bodhisattvas), and the manifestation-body (for ordinary beings). But the essence is this: the Buddha's body is truth itself.

⁴⁷ **Liberation-knowledge-and-vision**: The fifth of five aspects of the dharmakāya: morality, concentration, wisdom, liberation, and the knowledge-and-vision of liberation.

⁴⁸ **Four immeasurables**: Loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy, equanimity. These generate the emotional foundation of the Buddha-body.

⁴⁹ **Pāramitās**: The "perfections" or transcendent virtues—usually six: giving, morality, patience, vigor, concentration, wisdom. This passage expands the list.

⁵⁰ **Six spiritual penetrations**: Divine eye, divine ear, knowing others' minds, remembering past lives, supernatural powers, and knowing that the outflows are exhausted.

⁵¹ **Three insights**: Knowledge of past lives, the divine eye seeing beings' deaths and rebirths, and knowledge that the outflows are exhausted.

⁵² **Thirty-seven factors of enlightenment**: The complete set of practices leading to awakening.

⁵³ **Cessation and contemplation**: *Śamatha-vipaśyanā*—calming and insight. The two wings of meditation.

⁵⁴ **Ten powers, four fearlessnesses, eighteen unique qualities**: The special attributes of a fully awakened buddha.

⁵⁵ **Non-negligence**: *Apramāda*—careful mindfulness and spiritual vigilance. The Buddha's dying words emphasized this as the key to liberation.

⁵⁶ **Generate the mind of supreme enlightenment**: *Bodhicittotpāda*—generating the aspiration for complete awakening for the sake of all beings. This is what Vimalakirti's whole teaching has been building toward. All that talk about the body's impermanence, all them similes about foam and bubbles and mirages—it's all to inspire this one thing: the arising of *bodhicitta*, the heart that seeks awakening for all.

## Theological Notes

### Skillful Means Is Everything

This chapter is the primary place for the Vimalakirti Sutra's teaching on skillful means. Vimalakirti shows that any context—sacred or secular, pure or impure—can become a place of awakening activity. He goes into gambling halls, brothels, wine houses—not as a participant but as a liberator. The enlightened mind transforms every situation. There ain't no place the Dharma can't reach.

The Blues is built on this principle. We take the ancient truth and put it in a form folks can hear—in the language of the crossroads, the juke joint, the front porch. Meeting people where they are. That's skillful means.

### Lay Awakening

The detailed description of Vimalakirti's lay status while surpassing monastic attainments is a direct challenge to the idea that you gotta leave the world to wake up. The sutra is saying the distinction between lay and monastic is itself dualistic thinking that needs to be transcended. Vimalakirti wears white robes but keeps monastic discipline. He's got a wife but practices celibacy of the heart. Form and formlessness coincide.

The Blues comes from everyday people, not from temples. It's always known that the sacred ain't separate from the profane.

### Illness as Teaching

Vimalakirti's manifested illness is the chapter's central device. He ain't really sick—he's using sickness as a teaching tool. By getting "sick," he draws visitors, creates an occasion for Dharma, demonstrates non-attachment to the body, and shows that even suffering can be skillful means.

This is deep. The bodhisattva don't eliminate suffering—the bodhisattva transforms its meaning. Your wound becomes your wisdom. What breaks you can wake you.

The Blues knows about this. We take our suffering and turn it into song. We take our pain and make it medicine for others. That's what Vimalakirti's doing with his illness.

### The Body Meditation

Them twelve similes for the body—foam, bubble, mirage, plantain, illusion, dream, shadow, echo, cloud, lightning—these ain't just philosophy. They're objects for meditation. You sit with them. You see your own body through them. And when the seeing is complete, you're disenchanted—not in a sad way, but in a free way. You stop grasping at what can't be held.

### Buddha-Body as Dharma-Body

The culmination is that the Buddha-body is the Dharma-body—truth itself. This body ain't born and doesn't die. It's not produced like a conditioned thing. It's what you are when you stop identifying with what you're not.

The Blues is reaching for this body, even if it don't use these words. When the music transports you beyond yourself, when the testimony speaks through you instead of coming from you—that's tasting the Dharma-body.

## Vimalakirti Waiting

At that time, the elder Vimalakirti thought to himself: "Here I am, sick in bed. The World-Honored One got such great compassion—ain't he gonna take pity on me?"

The Buddha knew what he was thinking and immediately told Śāriputra: "Go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

---

## Śāriputra Ain't Going

Śāriputra said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time back in the day, I was sitting in meditation¹ under a tree in the forest. Vimalakirti came up and said to me:

"'Hey, Śāriputra! Just 'cause you're sitting don't mean you're meditating. True meditation² means not manifesting body or mind in the three realms—that's meditation. Not arising from the cessation³ yet showing all the deportments—that's meditation. Not abandoning the Way yet doing ordinary things—that's meditation. The mind not dwelling inside and not being outside—that's meditation. Not being moved by any views yet practicing the thirty-seven factors⁴—that's meditation. Not cutting off afflictions yet entering nirvāṇa—that's meditation. One who can sit like that—the Buddha approves.'

"At that time—World-Honored One!—when I heard these words, I just went silent. Couldn't say nothing back. That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

---

## Maudgalyāyana Ain't Going

The Buddha told Mahāmaudgalyāyana:⁵ "You go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

Maudgalyāyana said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time in the past, I went into the great city of Vaiśālī and was teaching the Dharma to the householders in the lanes. Vimalakirti came up and said to me:

"'Hey, Great Maudgalyāyana! When you're teaching the Dharma to these white-robed householders, you shouldn't teach like you've been teaching. One who teaches the Dharma should teach according to the Dharma.⁶

"'The Dharma is without sentient beings—it's free from the defilement of sentient beings. The Dharma is without self—it's free from the defilement of self. The Dharma is without life-span—it's free from birth and death. The Dharma is without persons—past and future are cut off.⁷ The Dharma is constantly quiet—all characteristics extinguished. The Dharma is apart from characteristics—nothing to grab onto. The Dharma is without name or word—talk is cut off.⁸ The Dharma is without explanation—free from thought and examination. The Dharma is without form—like empty space. The Dharma is without mental proliferation⁹—ultimately empty. The Dharma is without "mine"—free from "mine." The Dharma is without discrimination—free from all consciousnesses. The Dharma is without comparison—nothing to compare it to. The Dharma don't belong to causes—ain't located in conditions. The Dharma is identical with dharma-nature—enters all dharmas. The Dharma accords with thusness—ain't nothing it accords with. The Dharma abides at the true limit¹⁰—the extremes don't move it. The Dharma is without movement—don't depend on the six sense-objects. The Dharma is without coming or going—constantly don't abide. The Dharma conforms to emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness.¹¹ The Dharma is apart from beauty and ugliness. The Dharma is without increase or decrease. The Dharma is without birth or death. The Dharma got no destination. The Dharma transcends eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind. The Dharma is without high or low. The Dharma constantly abides without moving. The Dharma is apart from all conditioned practice.

"'Hey, Great Maudgalyāyana! The Dharma being like this, how can it be spoken? One who teaches the Dharma neither speaks nor demonstrates; one who listens neither hears nor attains. It's like a conjurer¹² teaching conjured beings—establish that understanding when you teach.

"'You should understand that folks' faculties are sharp or dull. Be skillful in knowing and seeing without obstruction. With the mind of great compassion, praise the Great Vehicle. Remember to repay the Buddha's kindness and don't let the Three Jewels be cut off—only then teach the Dharma.'

"When Vimalakirti taught this, eight hundred householders generated the mind of supreme enlightenment. I ain't got that eloquence. That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

---

## Mahākāśyapa Ain't Going

The Buddha told Mahākāśyapa:¹³ "You go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

Mahākāśyapa said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time in the past, I was begging for alms in the poor quarter. Vimalakirti came up and said to me:

"'Hey, Mahākāśyapa! You got a mind of loving-kindness and compassion, but you ain't universal with it—you bypass the rich and beg from the poor.¹⁴ Kāśyapa! Abide in the Dharma of equality and beg in proper sequence. Because you don't need to eat, you should beg for food. To destroy the appearance of composite unity,¹⁵ you should receive morsels. Because you don't receive, you should accept their food.

"'Enter the village with the perception of emptiness.¹⁶ See the forms you see like a blind man sees. Hear the sounds you hear like an echo. Smell the fragrances you smell like the wind. Taste the tastes you eat without discrimination. Accept all tangible things like cognitive wisdom. Know all dharmas as illusory in nature—without self-nature, without other-nature, originally not being so, and even now without extinction.¹⁷

"'Kāśyapa! If you can avoid rejecting the eight deviations¹⁸ and enter the eight liberations,¹⁹ using deviant characteristics to enter true Dharma; if with a single meal you can make offerings to all, making offerings to all buddhas and the assemblies of noble sages, and only then eat—eating like that, you're neither with afflictions nor apart from afflictions, neither entering concentration nor arising from concentration, neither dwelling in the worldly nor dwelling in nirvāṇa. Those who give to you will have neither great merit nor small merit—it neither benefits them nor harms them. This is correctly entering the Buddha-Way, not relying on the way of the śrāvakas.²⁰ Kāśyapa! If you eat like that, you don't vainly consume people's offerings.'

"At that time—World-Honored One!—when I heard these words, I experienced what I never experienced before. I immediately arose profound respect for all bodhisattvas. I thought: 'This one bearing a householder's name²¹ got such eloquence and wisdom! Who, hearing this, wouldn't generate the mind of supreme enlightenment?' From then on, I never again encouraged people to follow the ways of śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas.²² That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

---

## Subhūti Ain't Going

The Buddha told Subhūti:²³ "You go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

Subhūti said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time in the past, I went into his house to beg for food. Vimalakirti took my bowl, filled it with rice, and said to me:

"'Hey, Subhūti! If you can be equal regarding food, then all dharmas are also equal. If all dharmas are equal, then you're also equal regarding food.²⁴ Begging like that, you can take the food.

"'Subhūti! If you don't cut off lust, anger, and delusion, yet ain't bound by them; if you don't destroy the body yet accord with the single characteristic;²⁵ if you don't extinguish delusion and craving yet arise insight and liberation;²⁶ if with the characteristics of the five grave offenses you attain liberation,²⁷ yet are neither liberated nor bound; if you don't see the Four Noble Truths, yet it ain't that you haven't seen them; if you don't attain the fruits, yet it ain't that you haven't attained the fruits; if you're neither an ordinary person nor apart from ordinary-person dharmas; if you're neither a sage nor not a sage; if, though you accomplish all dharmas, you're apart from the characteristics of all dharmas—then you can take the food.

"'If, Subhūti, you don't see the Buddha and don't hear the Dharma—if those six heterodox teachers,²⁸ Pūraṇa Kāśyapa, Maskarin Gośālīputra, Sañjayin Vairaṭīputra, Ajita Keśakambala, Kakuda Kātyāyana, and Nirgrantha Jñātṛputra—if these are your teachers, and you left home following them, and wherever those teachers fall, you also fall—then you can take the food.

"'If, Subhūti, you enter wrong views and don't reach the other shore; if you dwell in the eight difficulties²⁹ and don't get freedom from difficulty; if you're identified with afflictions and separated from pure dharmas; if you get the samādhi of non-contention,³⁰ yet all sentient beings also get this samādhi; if those who give to you ain't called a field of merit; if those who make offerings to you fall into the three evil paths; if you join hands with Māra and make all distressed ones your companions; if you're no different from all māras and all afflictions; if you got enmity toward all sentient beings, slander all buddhas, and destroy the Dharma; if you ain't numbered among the assembly and will never attain final nirvāṇa—if you're like that, then you can take the food.'

"At that time—World-Honored One!—when I heard these words, I was bewildered.³¹ I didn't know what he was saying or how to answer. I set down my bowl and wanted to leave his house. Vimalakirti said:

"'Hey, Subhūti! Take your bowl—don't be afraid. What do you think? If a transformation-being³² created by the Tathāgata was questioned about this, would he be afraid?'

"I said: 'No.'

"Vimalakirti said: 'All dharmas are like illusory transformations. You shouldn't have any fear now. Why? All verbal expressions don't depart from this characteristic.³³ As for the wise, they ain't attached to words and therefore got no fear. Why? The nature of words is empty—there are no words. This is liberation. The characteristic of liberation is the characteristic of all dharmas.'

"When Vimalakirti taught this Dharma, two hundred devas got the pure Dharma-eye. That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

---

## Pūrṇa Ain't Going

The Buddha told Pūrṇa:³⁴ "You go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

Pūrṇa said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time in the past, I was in the great forest³⁵ under a tree, teaching the Dharma to some newly-ordained monks. Vimalakirti came up and said to me:

"'Hey, Pūrṇa! First you should enter samādhi and observe these people's minds, then teach. Don't put defiled food in a precious vessel.³⁶ You should know what these monks are thinking. Don't confuse lapis lazuli with crystal.³⁷ You can't know the roots of sentient beings—don't presume to give the Lesser Vehicle Dharma.³⁸ They themselves got no wounds—don't wound them. Those wanting to walk the great path shouldn't be shown the small path. Don't put the great ocean into an ox's hoofprint. Don't treat sunlight the same as firefly light.

"'Pūrṇa! These monks long ago generated the Great Vehicle mind but forgot it in the middle. Why do you instruct them with the Lesser Vehicle Dharma? I see that Lesser Vehicle wisdom is shallow and petty, like a blind person who can't distinguish the sharp and dull faculties of sentient beings.'

"At that time, Vimalakirti immediately entered samādhi and caused those monks to know their former lives:³⁹ they'd planted roots of merit under five hundred buddhas and had dedicated them toward supreme enlightenment. Immediately their realization was clear, and they regained their original minds. All the monks bowed at Vimalakirti's feet. Then Vimalakirti taught them the Dharma, and they became irreversible from supreme enlightenment.

"I thought that śrāvakas who don't observe people's faculties shouldn't teach the Dharma. That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

---

## Mahākātyāyana Ain't Going

The Buddha told Mahākātyāyana:⁴⁰ "You go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

Kātyāyana said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time in the past, after the Buddha briefly taught the essential teachings to the monks, I afterward elaborated on their meaning—the meaning of impermanence, the meaning of suffering, the meaning of emptiness, the meaning of non-self, the meaning of quiescence.⁴¹ Vimalakirti came up and said to me:

"'Hey, Kātyāyana! Don't use the mind of arising and ceasing⁴² to explain the Dharma of true reality.⁴³ Kātyāyana! All dharmas ultimately neither arise nor cease—that's the meaning of impermanence.⁴⁴ The five appropriated aggregates,⁴⁵ penetrated through, are empty and without arising—that's the meaning of suffering.⁴⁶ All dharmas ultimately got nothing whatsoever—that's the meaning of emptiness.⁴⁷ Self and no-self ain't two—that's the meaning of non-self.⁴⁸ The Dharma originally wasn't so, and even now is without extinction—that's the meaning of quiescence.'⁴⁹

"When he taught this Dharma, all those monks liberated their minds. That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

---

## Aniruddha Ain't Going

The Buddha told Aniruddha:⁵⁰ "You go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

Aniruddha said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time in the past, I was doing walking meditation somewhere. A Brahmā-king named Śubhavyūha,⁵¹ together with ten thousand Brahmās, emitting pure radiance, came to me, bowed at my feet, and asked:

"'How far does the divine eye of Aniruddha see?'

"I replied: 'Benevolent one! I see the entire billion-world system of Śākyamuni Buddha, like viewing a small fruit⁵² in the palm of my hand.'

"At that time, Vimalakirti came up and said to me: 'Hey, Aniruddha! Does what the divine eye sees have the characteristic of conditioned activity or the characteristic of unconditioned activity?⁵³ If it's conditioned, then it's the same as the five supernatural powers of the heterodox teachers. If it's unconditioned, then it's the unconditioned and shouldn't have seeing.'

"World-Honored One! At that time I just went silent. The Brahmās, hearing his words, experienced what they never experienced before, and immediately bowed to him and asked: 'Who in the world truly possesses the divine eye?'

"Vimalakirti said: 'There is—the Buddha, the World-Honored One, possesses the true divine eye.⁵⁴ Constantly abiding in samādhi, he sees all buddha-lands without the characteristic of duality.'

"Then the Brahmā-king Śubhavyūha and his entourage of five hundred Brahmā-devas all generated the mind of supreme enlightenment. Having bowed at Vimalakirti's feet, they suddenly disappeared. That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

---

## Upāli Ain't Going

The Buddha told Upāli:⁵⁵ "You go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

Upāli said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time in the past, two monks had violated the Vinaya rules⁵⁶ and were ashamed to ask the Buddha. They came to ask me:

"'Upāli! We violated the Vinaya and are truly ashamed. We dare not ask the Buddha. Please resolve our doubt and regret so we can be freed from this fault.'

"I immediately explained according to the Dharma. Vimalakirti came up and said to me:

"'Hey, Upāli! Don't add to the guilt of these two monks! Just directly eliminate it; don't disturb their minds. Why? The nature of that guilt ain't internal, ain't external, and ain't in between.⁵⁷ As the Buddha said, when the mind is defiled, sentient beings are defiled; when the mind is pure, sentient beings are pure. The mind, too, ain't internal, ain't external, and ain't in between. As the mind is, so is guilt-defilement; so are all dharmas—not departing from thusness.⁵⁸

"'Upāli! When the mind-characteristic attains liberation, is there defilement or not?'

"I said: 'There is not.'

"Vimalakirti said: 'The mind-characteristic of all sentient beings being without defilement is also like this. Hey, Upāli! Delusive thinking is defilement; no delusive thinking is purity. Inversion is defilement; no inversion is purity. Grasping a self is defilement; not grasping a self is purity.

"'Upāli! All dharmas arise and cease without abiding, like illusion, like lightning.⁵⁹ Dharmas don't wait for each other—they don't even abide for a single moment. All dharmas are false appearances, like a dream, like a flame, like the moon in water, like a reflection in a mirror—they arise from delusive thinking. One who knows this is one who upholds the Vinaya. One who knows this has good understanding.'

"Then the two monks said: 'Supreme wisdom! This is something Upāli can't match—the foremost upholder of the Vinaya, yet he can't speak like this!'⁶⁰

"I replied: 'Setting aside the Tathāgata, no śrāvaka or bodhisattva can match his joyful eloquence—his wisdom and insight are so brilliant!'

"At that time, the two monks' doubt and regret were immediately removed. They generated the mind of supreme enlightenment and made this vow: 'May all sentient beings attain this eloquence!'

"That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

---

## Rāhula Ain't Going

The Buddha told Rāhula:⁶¹ "You go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

Rāhula said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time in the past, the elder's sons of Vaiśālī came to me, bowed at my feet, and asked:

"'Rāhula! You're the son of the Buddha. You renounced the position of a wheel-turning king and left home to pursue the Way. What benefits does leaving home have?'

"I immediately explained the benefits and merits of leaving home according to the Dharma. Vimalakirti came up and said to me:

"'Hey, Rāhula! You shouldn't speak of the benefits and merits of leaving home.⁶² Why? That which is without benefit and without merit—that is leaving home. The conditioned dharmas can be spoken of as having benefit and merit. But leaving home is the unconditioned dharma, and in the unconditioned there is no benefit and no merit.

"'Rāhula! Leaving home is being without this and without that, and without the middle between them.⁶³ It's apart from the sixty-two views,⁶⁴ abiding in nirvāṇa. It's what the wise accept and what the noble practice. It's conquering the hosts of māras, crossing beyond the five destinies, purifying the five eyes, attaining the five powers, and establishing the five faculties. It don't disturb others and departs from various evils. It's crushing the heterodox teachers and transcending conventional names. It's emerging from the mire without attachment, without "mine," without reception, without disturbance, cherishing inner joy, guarding others' minds, according with meditation, and departing from all faults. If one is able to be like that—that's true leaving home.'

"Then Vimalakirti said to the elder's sons: 'It's appropriate that you all leave home in the true Dharma together. Why? It's hard to meet a buddha-age!'

"The elder's sons said: 'Elder! We heard the Buddha say, if one's parents don't give permission, one can't leave home.'

"Vimalakirti said: 'That's right! Then you all should generate the mind of supreme enlightenment—that's leaving home, that's complete ordination.'⁶⁵

"At that time, thirty-two elder's sons all generated the mind of supreme enlightenment. That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

---

## Ānanda Ain't Going

The Buddha told Ānanda:⁶⁶ "You go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

Ānanda said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time in the past, when the World-Honored One's body had a slight illness and needed cow's milk, I immediately took my bowl and went to stand at the gate of a great brahmin's house. Vimalakirti came up and said to me:

"'Hey, Ānanda! Why you standing here with your bowl in the early morning?'

"I said: 'Elder! The World-Honored One's body has a slight illness and needs cow's milk, so I came here.'

"Vimalakirti said: 'Stop, stop, Ānanda! Don't say such things! The Tathāgata's body is a vajra body;⁶⁷ all evils been cut off; all goodness gathered together. What illness could there be? What affliction could there be?

"'Go silently, Ānanda! Don't slander the Tathāgata. Don't let others hear such coarse words. Don't let the great, powerfully-virtuous devas and the bodhisattvas who came from other pure lands hear these words.

"'Ānanda! A wheel-turning sage-king, because of just a little merit, is free from illness.⁶⁸ How much more so the Tathāgata, whose immeasurable accumulated merit is universally victorious! Go, Ānanda! Don't make us receive such disgrace. If the heterodox teachers and brahmins were to hear these words, they would think: "How can he be called a teacher? He can't save his own illness—how can he save the illnesses of others?" You should leave quick and secretly—don't let others hear.

"'You should know, Ānanda, the bodies of all tathāgatas are the Dharma-body, not the body of thought and desire.⁶⁹ The Buddha is the World-Honored One, transcending the three realms. The Buddha's body is without outflows—all outflows exhausted. The Buddha's body is unconditioned—it don't fall within enumeration.⁷⁰ Such a body—what illness could it have? What affliction could it have?'

"At that time—World-Honored One!—I was truly ashamed. Had I perhaps, being close to the Buddha, made an error in hearing?⁷¹ Immediately I heard a voice from the sky saying: 'Ānanda! What the elder says is true. But it's because the Buddha has appeared in the five turbidities of the evil age⁷² that he performs this practice to liberate sentient beings. Go, Ānanda! Take the milk and don't be ashamed.'

"World-Honored One! Such is Vimalakirti's wisdom and eloquence! That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

## Concluding the Blues

So all five hundred great disciples, each one explained to the Buddha the account of their own past encounter, describing what Vimalakirti had said. Every one of them declared they couldn't go ask about his illness.

---

## Endnotes

¹ **Sitting in meditation**: Śāriputra was doing formal seated meditation—the foundational practice. But Vimalakirti challenges the external form.

² **True meditation**: Vimalakirti redefines meditation. It ain't about the posture—it's about the state. His six definitions systematically deconstruct all dualities.

³ **Cessation**: The highest meditative absorption. But Vimalakirti's point: true meditation maintains liberation *while* engaging in life, not by withdrawing.

⁴ **Thirty-seven factors**: The complete Buddhist path. You can practice all of them while being unmoved by views—practice without attachment.

⁵ **Mahāmaudgalyāyana**: Foremost in supernatural powers. Gets schooled on what Dharma really is.

⁶ **Dharma according to Dharma**: This begins one of the sutra's most profound philosophical passages—twenty-plus characteristics describing what Dharma is by saying what it ain't.

⁷ **Past and future cut off**: Time dissolves under analysis. There's no continuous "person" linking past to future.

⁸ **Talk is cut off**: The Dharma transcends words. This anticipates Chapter 9's silence.

⁹ **Mental proliferation**: The thinking that obscures reality. Dharma is free from all that.

¹⁰ **True limit**: The absolute reality where all distinctions end.

¹¹ **Emptiness, signlessness, wishlessness**: The three gates to liberation.

¹² **Conjurer teaching conjured beings**: THIS IS POWERFUL. If teacher and audience are both illusions, what is teaching? Teaching still happens, but without the solidity we think it has.

¹³ **Mahākāśyapa**: Foremost in ascetic practices. The extreme austere monk.

¹⁴ **Bypassing the rich**: Kāśyapa avoided wealthy homes. Vimalakirti calls this out—true compassion is universal, not selective.

¹⁵ **Composite unity**: The false appearance of unified selfhood. Eating mindfully deconstructs even the alms-round.

¹⁶ **Perception of emptiness**: Enter the village seeing it as empty of inherent existence.

¹⁷ **Originally not being so**: A key formula—phenomena never had inherent existence. Nothing to destroy.

¹⁸ **Eight deviations**: Wrong view, thought, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, concentration.

¹⁹ **Eight liberations**: Progressive meditative attainments.

²⁰ **Not relying on the śrāvaka way**: Kāśyapa's previous approach was śrāvaka-style—seeking personal liberation through asceticism. The bodhisattva way transforms every action into benefit for all.

²¹ **Bearing a householder's name**: Emphasis that Vimalakirti is "just a layman" with such profound realization.

²² **Pratyekabuddhas**: Solitary Buddhas who wake up alone and don't teach. Limited realization from the Mahāyāna view.

²³ **Subhūti**: Foremost in understanding emptiness. His encounter with Vimalakirti is especially rich—both are emptiness specialists.

²⁴ **Equality regarding food and dharmas**: For one who realizes emptiness, there's no distinction—all equally empty, equally real.

²⁵ **Single characteristic**: The characteristic of no characteristic.

²⁶ **Insight and liberation**: Not through cutting off delusion, but through seeing through it.

²⁷ **Five grave offenses**: Killing father, mother, or arhat; shedding buddha's blood; creating schism. Even through these characteristics one can be liberated—ultimate non-attachment transcends even karma.

²⁸ **Six heterodox teachers**: The six non-Buddhist teachers of Buddha's time. Vimalakirti's point: if you're truly empty, what difference is there?

²⁹ **Eight difficulties**: Conditions making Dharma-encounter hard.

³⁰ **Samādhi of non-contention**: Subhūti's specialty—perfect peace without conflict.

³¹ **Bewildered**: Subhūti, the emptiness-master, is stunned by the paradoxes.

³² **Transformation-being**: An illusory person created by buddha's power. If questioned, it wouldn't fear because it knows it got no substantial existence.

³³ **Don't depart from this characteristic**: Language is empty too. Words are as illusory as conjured beings. Liberation is the nature of words themselves.

³⁴ **Pūrṇa**: Foremost in preaching the Dharma.

³⁵ **Great forest**: The Mahāvana near Vaiśālī.

³⁶ **Defiled food in precious vessel**: Inappropriate to put lesser teachings in minds capable of greater realization.

³⁷ **Lapis lazuli and crystal**: Don't treat the precious as ordinary.

³⁸ **Lesser Vehicle Dharma**: Teachings focused on personal liberation rather than bodhisattva-hood.

³⁹ **Knowing former lives**: Through samādhi, Vimalakirti revealed the monks' past-life aspirations.

⁴⁰ **Mahākātyāyana**: Foremost in detailed analytical exposition.

⁴¹ **Five meanings**: Standard Abhidharma expositions. Vimalakirti reinterprets each.

⁴² **Mind of arising and ceasing**: Conventional thinking that sees things as truly arising and ceasing.

⁴³ **Dharma of true reality**: Reality as it is, beyond arising and ceasing.

⁴⁴ **Meaning of impermanence reinterpreted**: Impermanence don't mean things arise and pass; rather, nothing ever truly arises or ceases.

⁴⁵ **Five appropriated aggregates**: Form, feeling, perception, formations, consciousness as grasped.

⁴⁶ **Meaning of suffering reinterpreted**: Suffering is the emptiness of the aggregates themselves.

⁴⁷ **Meaning of emptiness reinterpreted**: Not analytical absence of self, but ultimate non-existence of all dharmas.

⁴⁸ **Meaning of non-self reinterpreted**: Not merely absence of self, but non-duality of self and non-self.

⁴⁹ **Meaning of quiescence reinterpreted**: Not cessation of something that existed, but recognition nothing ever needed to be extinguished.

⁵⁰ **Aniruddha**: Foremost in the divine eye.

⁵¹ **Śubhavyūha**: "Splendid Array." A Brahmā-king.

⁵² **Small fruit**: The āmalaka fruit, used as example of something seen clearly.

⁵³ **Conditioned or unconditioned**: Vimalakirti's incisive question—if conditioned, it's mundane; if unconditioned, no seeing. Exposes the logical limits.

⁵⁴ **True divine eye**: The Buddha's seeing is beyond conditioned/unconditioned duality.

⁵⁵ **Upāli**: Foremost in Vinaya (discipline). His specialty is rules; Vimalakirti transcends rules.

⁵⁶ **Vinaya rules**: The monastic code. The two monks' violation unspecified.

⁵⁷ **Not internal, external, or in between**: Standard negation of location. Guilt, like all dharmas, is unfindable.

⁵⁸ **Not departing from thusness**: All phenomena—including guilt—are expressions of thusness. Nothing falls outside reality.

⁵⁹ **Like illusion, like lightning**: Standard images for impermanence and insubstantiality.

⁶⁰ **The Vinaya master can't match this**: The irony—the discipline specialist lacks the wisdom to truly resolve guilt. True Vinaya is understanding guilt's empty nature.

⁶¹ **Rāhula**: The Buddha's son; foremost in inconspicuous practice.

⁶² **Benefits of leaving home**: Rāhula's conventional answer focused on merit. Vimalakirti points to leaving home as unconditioned—beyond benefit.

⁶³ **Without this, that, or middle**: Complete non-duality.

⁶⁴ **Sixty-two views**: Wrong views catalogued in early Buddhism.

⁶⁵ **REVOLUTIONARY TEACHING**: Generating bodhicitta IS leaving home. You don't need to physically leave family if you generate the awakening mind. Internal transformation, accessible to laypeople.

⁶⁶ **Ānanda**: The Buddha's attendant; foremost in hearing and memory.

⁶⁷ **Vajra body**: The indestructible body of the Buddha.

⁶⁸ **Wheel-turning king free from illness**: Even mundane merit protects from disease.

⁶⁹ **KEY DOCTRINE: Dharma-body, not body of thought and desire**: The Buddha's true body is unconditioned. Foundational for Mahāyāna Buddhology.

⁷⁰ **Don't fall within enumeration**: The Buddha's body is beyond categorization.

⁷¹ **Error in hearing**: Ānanda, famous for hearing perfectly, doubts himself.

⁷² **Five turbidities**: The five degenerations of the evil age.

## Theological Notes

### The Dharma Combat Pattern

Every encounter follows the same pattern: (1) The Buddha sends a disciple; (2) the disciple recalls a past encounter with Vimalakirti; (3) Vimalakirti exposed a limitation in the disciple's understanding; (4) the disciple was silenced or transformed; (5) the disciple declines. This pattern builds dramatic tension—who CAN visit Vimalakirti?

### Each Disciple Represents a Specialty

Śāriputra (wisdom), Maudgalyāyana (powers), Kāśyapa (asceticism), Subhūti (emptiness), Pūrṇa (preaching), Kātyāyana (analysis), Aniruddha (divine eye), Upāli (discipline), Rāhula (hidden practice), Ānanda (memory). Each is foremost in something. Yet each falls short when facing Vimalakirti's non-dual understanding. The message: specialized spiritual attainments, however advanced, are still limited.

### The Superior Layman

This chapter establishes that a layperson (Vimalakirti) surpasses all the Buddha's foremost monastic disciples. This is revolutionary—challenging the assumption that awakening requires renunciation.

### Non-Dual Understanding

Each teaching Vimalakirti offers transcends dualities: sitting/not-sitting, pure/impure, wealthy/poor, views/practice, guilt/innocence, leaving home/staying home, healthy/ill. The Blues understands this—life ain't black and white, and the deepest truth transcends all oppositions.

## The Buddha Keeps Trying

So then the Buddha told the Bodhisattva Maitreya:¹ "You go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

---

## Maitreya Ain't Going

Maitreya said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time in the past, I was teaching the Tuṣita Heaven king and his folks about the practices of the non-retrogression stage.² Vimalakirti came up and said to me:

"'Maitreya! The World-Honored One gave you the prediction that in one more lifetime you gonna attain supreme enlightenment.³ Which lifetime did you receive that prediction for? Is it the past lifetime? The future lifetime? Or the present lifetime?

"'If it's the past lifetime, the past lifetime already perished. If it's the future lifetime, the future lifetime ain't arrived yet. If it's the present lifetime, the present lifetime don't abide.⁴ As the Buddha said: "Monk! In this very moment you're also being born, also aging, and also dying."⁵

"'If you received the prediction based on non-arising,⁶ then non-arising is the ultimate position.⁷ In that ultimate position, there ain't no receiving prediction and no attaining supreme enlightenment. So how did Maitreya receive the one-lifetime prediction?

"'Did you receive the prediction from thusness arising or from thusness ceasing?⁸ If from thusness arising, thusness don't arise. If from thusness ceasing, thusness don't cease.

"'All sentient beings are thusness.⁹ All dharmas are also thusness. All holy sages are also thusness. And Maitreya is also thusness. If Maitreya receives a prediction, all sentient beings should also receive a prediction. Why? Thusness is non-dual and non-different.¹⁰ If Maitreya attains supreme enlightenment, all sentient beings should also attain it. Why? All sentient beings ARE the characteristic of bodhi.¹¹ If Maitreya attains nirvāṇa, all sentient beings should also attain nirvāṇa. Why? All buddhas know that all sentient beings are ultimately quiescent—that's the characteristic of nirvāṇa. There ain't no further extinction to undergo.¹²

"'Therefore, Maitreya! Don't seduce these deva-sons with this teaching. In reality, nobody generates the mind of supreme enlightenment, and nobody retrogresses from it. Maitreya! You should cause these deva-sons to abandon their discriminating views about bodhi. Why?

"'Bodhi can't be attained by body and can't be attained by mind.¹³ Quiescence is bodhi, 'cause all characteristics are extinguished. Non-viewing is bodhi, 'cause all conditions are abandoned. Non-action is bodhi, 'cause there's no recollection. Cutting off is bodhi, 'cause all views are relinquished. Separation is bodhi, 'cause all delusive thoughts are abandoned. Obstruction is bodhi, 'cause all aspirations are obstructed.¹⁴ Non-entry is bodhi, 'cause there's no attachment. Accordance is bodhi, 'cause it accords with thusness. Abiding is bodhi, 'cause it abides in dharma-nature. Reaching is bodhi, 'cause it reaches the true limit.¹⁵ Non-duality is bodhi, 'cause it's apart from mind and mental objects.¹⁶ Equality is bodhi, 'cause it equals empty space. Unconditioned is bodhi, 'cause it's without arising, abiding, or ceasing. Knowing is bodhi, 'cause it comprehends the mental activities of sentient beings. Non-meeting is bodhi, 'cause all sense-bases don't meet.¹⁷ Non-uniting is bodhi, 'cause it's apart from the residue of afflictions. No location is bodhi, 'cause it's without form or color. Provisional name is bodhi, 'cause names and words are empty.¹⁸ Like transformation is bodhi, 'cause there's no grasping or rejecting. Without confusion is bodhi, 'cause it's constantly self-quiescent. Excellent quiescence is bodhi, 'cause its nature is pure. Non-grasping is bodhi, 'cause it's apart from clinging. Without difference is bodhi, 'cause all dharmas are equal. Without comparison is bodhi, 'cause there's nothing it can be compared to. Subtle and wonderful is bodhi, 'cause all dharmas are hard to know.'¹⁹

"World-Honored One! When Vimalakirti taught this, two hundred deva-sons got the patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas.²⁰ That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

---

## Prabhāvyūha Ain't Going

The Buddha told the youth Prabhāvyūha:²¹ "You go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

Prabhāvyūha said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time in the past, as I was leaving the great city of Vaiśālī, Vimalakirti was just entering the city. I immediately bowed in greeting and asked:

"'Elder, where you coming from?'

"He answered: 'I'm coming from the bodhimaṇḍa.'²²

"I asked: 'What's the bodhimaṇḍa?'

"He answered: 'An upright mind is the bodhimaṇḍa,²³ 'cause it's free from falsehood. Generating practice is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it gets things done. A profound mind is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it increases merit. The bodhi-mind is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it's without error. Giving is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it don't seek reward. Upholding the precepts is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it fulfills vows. Patience is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause the mind is unobstructed toward all sentient beings. Vigor is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it don't slacken or retreat. Meditation is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause the mind is regulated and gentle. Wisdom is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it directly sees all dharmas. Loving-kindness is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it's equal toward all sentient beings. Compassion is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it endures weariness and suffering. Sympathetic joy is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it delights in the Dharma. Equanimity is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it cuts off aversion and affection. Supernatural powers are the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause they accomplish the six penetrations. Liberation is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it can turn its back on defilements.²⁴ Skillful means is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it teaches and transforms sentient beings. The four means of attraction are the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause they embrace sentient beings. Extensive learning is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause you practice what you've heard. Controlling the mind is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it correctly contemplates all dharmas.²⁵ The thirty-seven factors of enlightenment are the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause they abandon conditioned dharmas. The truths²⁶ are the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause they don't deceive the world. Dependent origination is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause ignorance up to old age and death are all without exhaustion.²⁷ The afflictions are the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause they're known as they truly are. Sentient beings are the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause they're known to be without self. All dharmas are the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause all dharmas are known to be empty. Conquering Māra is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it ain't overturned. The three realms are the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause there's no destination. The lion's roar is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it's fearless. The powers, fearlessnesses, and unique qualities are the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause they're without faults. The three insights are the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause they're without remaining obstructions. In one thought-moment knowing all dharmas is the bodhimaṇḍa, 'cause it accomplishes omniscience.²⁸

"'So, good son! If a bodhisattva teaches and transforms sentient beings in accordance with the pāramitās, whatever he does—raising his foot or lowering his foot—you should know it all comes from the bodhimaṇḍa and abides in the Buddha-Dharma.'²⁹

"When he taught this, five hundred deva-sons and humans all generated the mind of supreme enlightenment. That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

---

## Jagatīṃdhara Ain't Going

The Buddha told the Bodhisattva Jagatīṃdhara:³⁰ "You go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

Jagatīṃdhara said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time in the past, I was staying in my quiet room. Māra,³¹ the evil one, came with twelve thousand celestial maidens, looking like Śakra, with drums and strings and songs. He and his folks bowed at my feet, joined their palms, and stood to one side.

"I, thinking he was Śakra,³² said to him: 'Welcome, Kauśika! You deserve such merit, but you shouldn't be self-indulgent. Contemplate the impermanence of the five desires and seek the wholesome root; regarding body, life, and wealth, you should cultivate the solid Dharma.'

"He said to me: 'Righteous one! Accept these twelve thousand celestial maidens to be your attendants.'

"I said: 'Kauśika! Don't offer such non-Dharmic things to a son of the Śākya's śramaṇa.³³ This ain't appropriate for me.'

"Before I finished speaking, Vimalakirti came up and said to me: 'This ain't Śakra—this is Māra, come to disturb you!'

"He immediately addressed Māra: 'These women can be given to me—I'm one who should accept them.'

"Māra was alarmed, thinking: 'Will Vimalakirti harm me?' He tried to hide and leave, but couldn't. Using all his supernatural powers, he still couldn't leave. Then he heard a voice from the sky: 'Pāpīyas! Give the women to him, and only then can you leave.'

"Māra, out of fear, reluctantly gave them.

"Vimalakirti told the women: 'Māra gave you to me. Now you should all generate the mind of supreme enlightenment.'³⁴

"He taught them according to their capacities, causing them to aspire to the Way. Then he said: 'You've already generated the aspiration for the Way. You got Dharma-joy to enjoy yourselves—you shouldn't take pleasure in the five desires anymore.'³⁵

"The maidens asked: 'What's Dharma-joy?'

"He answered: 'Joy is constantly having faith in the Buddha. Joy is wanting to hear the Dharma. Joy is making offerings to the assembly. Joy is being apart from the five desires. Joy is viewing the five aggregates as enemies. Joy is viewing the four elements as venomous snakes. Joy is viewing the sense-bases as empty villages.³⁶ Joy is following and protecting the aspiration for the Way. Joy is benefiting sentient beings. Joy is honoring and serving the teacher. Joy is giving extensively. Joy is firmly upholding the precepts. Joy is patience and gentleness. Joy is diligently gathering the roots of goodness. Joy is meditation without confusion. Joy is wisdom apart from defilements. Joy is widely generating the bodhi-mind. Joy is conquering the māras. Joy is cutting off the afflictions. Joy is purifying the buddha-lands. Joy is accomplishing the marks and characteristics, thereby cultivating all merits. Joy is adorning the bodhimaṇḍa. Joy is hearing the profound Dharma without fear. Joy is the three gates of liberation³⁷ without delighting in inopportune times. Joy is being close to those who study the same Dharma. Joy is having no resentment toward those who don't study the same Dharma.³⁸ Joy is supporting even evil friends. Joy is drawing close to good friends.³⁹ Joy is joyful purity of mind. Joy is cultivating immeasurable practice-methods of the Way. That's the Dharma-joy of bodhisattvas.'

"Then Māra told the women: 'I wanna return with you to the heavenly palace.'

"The women said: 'Since you gave us to this elder, we got Dharma-joy and are very joyful. We don't take pleasure in the five desires anymore.'

"Māra said: 'Elder, can you release these women? To give away all one has—that's the bodhisattva.'

"Vimalakirti said: 'I already released them! You can take them. Let all sentient beings' Dharma-aspirations be fulfilled.'⁴⁰

"Then the women asked Vimalakirti: 'How should we abide in Māra's palace?'

"Vimalakirti said: 'Sisters! There's a Dharma-gate called the Inexhaustible Lamp.⁴¹ You should learn it. The Inexhaustible Lamp is like a single lamp lighting a hundred thousand lamps—the dark all become bright, and the brightness never runs out.

"'So, sisters! A single bodhisattva guides and opens up a hundred thousand sentient beings, causing them to generate the mind of supreme enlightenment—their aspiration for the Way never runs out either. According to what they teach, they increase all wholesome dharmas in themselves. That's the Inexhaustible Lamp.

"'Even though you live in Māra's palace, with this Inexhaustible Lamp, cause innumerable deva-sons and deva-daughters to generate the mind of supreme enlightenment. This will repay the Buddha's kindness and greatly benefit all sentient beings.'

"The maidens bowed at Vimalakirti's feet and followed Māra back to the palace, suddenly disappearing.

"World-Honored One! Vimalakirti got such autonomous supernatural power and wise eloquent speech. That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

---

## Sudhana Ain't Going

The Buddha told the elder's son Sudhana:⁴² "You go to Vimalakirti and ask about his illness."

Sudhana said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! I can't go ask about his illness. Why? I remember one time in the past, at my father's house I held a great donation ceremony,⁴³ making offerings to all śramaṇas and brahmins, various non-Buddhist teachers, the poor, the lowly, orphans and solitaries, and beggars. After the full seven days, Vimalakirti came in and said to me:

"'Son of an elder! A great donation ceremony shouldn't be held like you're holding it. You should hold a Dharma-giving ceremony.⁴⁴ What's the use of a wealth-giving ceremony?'

"I said: 'Elder! What's a Dharma-giving ceremony?'

"He answered: 'A Dharma-giving ceremony is one where, without before or after, you simultaneously make offerings to all sentient beings.⁴⁵ That's a Dharma-giving ceremony.'

"I said: 'What does that mean?'

"'It means: Using bodhi to arouse the mind of loving-kindness.⁴⁶ Using saving sentient beings to arouse great compassion. Using upholding the true Dharma to arouse sympathetic joy. Using gathering wisdom to practice equanimity. Using gathering up stinginess and greed to arouse the pāramitā of giving. Using transforming those who violate precepts to arouse the pāramitā of morality. Using the teaching of non-self to arouse the pāramitā of patience. Using departing from the characteristics of body and mind to arouse the pāramitā of vigor. Using the characteristic of bodhi to arouse the pāramitā of meditation. Using omniscience to arouse the pāramitā of wisdom.

"'Teaching and transforming sentient beings, yet arising emptiness. Not abandoning conditioned dharmas, yet arising signlessness. Manifesting being born, yet arising wishlessness. Protecting and upholding the true Dharma, arising the power of skillful means. Using liberating sentient beings to arise the four means of attraction. Using honoring all beings to arise the elimination of pride. Regarding body, life, and wealth, arising the three solid dharmas.⁴⁷ In the six recollections, arising the method of thought.⁴⁸ In the six harmonies and reverence, arising straightforward mind.⁴⁹ Correctly practicing wholesome dharmas, arising pure livelihood. With pure and joyful mind, arising closeness to noble sages. Without hating evil people, arising a regulated mind. With the dharma of leaving home, arising profound mind. With practicing as you say, arising extensive learning. With the teaching of non-contention, arising solitude. Tending toward Buddha's wisdom, arising seated meditation. Liberating the bonds of sentient beings, arising stages of practice. With accomplishing the marks and purifying buddha-lands, arising meritorious karma. Knowing all sentient beings' thoughts and teaching accordingly, arising knowledge-karma. Knowing all dharmas without grasping or rejecting and entering the single-characteristic gate, arising wisdom-karma.⁵⁰ Cutting off all afflictions, obstacles, and unwholesome dharmas, arising all wholesome karma. Attaining all wisdom and all wholesome dharmas, arising all practices that assist the Buddha-Way.

"'So, good son! That's a Dharma-giving ceremony. If a bodhisattva abides in this Dharma-giving ceremony, he's a great donor and also a field of merit for all the world.'⁵¹

"World-Honored One! When Vimalakirti taught this, among the brahmins two hundred people all generated the mind of supreme enlightenment. At that time, my mind attained purity. I sighed at what I'd never experienced! I bowed at Vimalakirti's feet and immediately removed my necklace worth a hundred thousand to offer him, but he refused it.

"I said: 'Elder! Please accept it and give it as you wish.'

"Vimalakirti then accepted the necklace and divided it into two parts. He gave one part to the lowest beggar in the assembly and offered one part to the Tathāgata Duṣprasaha.⁵² Everybody saw the Radiant Land of that buddha, and they also saw the pearl necklace on that buddha transforming into a four-pillared jeweled platform, magnificently adorned on all four sides.

"Vimalakirti then said: 'If a donor gives with an equal mind to the lowest beggar, this is the same as the field of merit of the Tathāgata—without any discrimination, equal in great compassion, not seeking any reward. That's called complete Dharma-giving.'⁵³

"When the lowest beggar in the city saw this spiritual power and heard his words, they all generated the mind of supreme enlightenment. That's why I can't go ask about his illness."

## Concluding the Blues

So all the bodhisattvas each explained to the Buddha the account of their own past encounter, describing what Vimalakirti said. Every one of them declared they couldn't go ask about his illness.

## Endnotes

¹ **Maitreya**: The future buddha, currently a bodhisattva waiting in Tuṣita Heaven. He's next in line.

² **Non-retrogression stage**: The stage from which a bodhisattva can't fall back. Vimalakirti challenges even this.

³ **One-lifetime prediction**: The prophecy that in Maitreya's next life he'll become a buddha. His defining characteristic.

⁴ **Present don't abide**: The present moment is too fleeting—it's already gone before it can be grasped. The Blues knows about this—try to hold onto joy and it slips through your fingers.

³² **Śakra/Kauśika**: Indra, king of the gods.

## Theological Notes

### Maitreya's Prediction Deconstructed

Even the future buddha's prediction is empty. There's no moment when it happened—past is gone, future ain't here, present don't stay. If prediction is based on non-arising, then non-arising is beyond prediction. If Maitreya is thusness, and all beings are thusness, then all beings are equally predicted. The bodhisattva path includes transcending the bodhisattva path.

### The Bodhimaṇḍa Is Everywhere

Prabhāvyūha's encounter transforms where awakening happens. It ain't under a particular tree in India—it's in every quality of the path, in every moment, in every step. The Blues knows this—awakening ain't at the end of the road, it's the road itself.

### The Inexhaustible Lamp

This teaching to Māra's women is famous. One lamp lights countless lamps without diminishing. The light spreads without end. This is the bodhisattva vision—your awakening benefits all, and that benefit never runs out. The Blues spreads the same way—one song inspiring another, each performance unique but the spirit undiminished.

### Dharma-Giving vs. Wealth-Giving

Material generosity has its place, but it don't free anyone. Dharma-giving—sharing the truth—liberates. And the highest Dharma-giving sees no difference between the beggar and the buddha. Equal heart, equal gift.
