## Special Considerations for Vimalakirti Sutra

- **Dharma Combat**: Translate as Blues "signifying" - verbal sparring with deep respect
- **Vimalakirti's Illness**: The Blues knows about suffering as teaching
- **Non-Duality**: "The Blues don't make no difference between..."
- **Lay Practice**: Vimalakirti as "a man in the world but not of it"
- **Silence**: The deepest Blues is sometimes wordless
