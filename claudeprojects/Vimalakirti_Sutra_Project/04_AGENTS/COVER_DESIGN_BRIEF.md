# COVER DESIGN BRIEF: Vimalakirti Sutra Blues Interpretation

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
**Title:** The Vimalakirti Sutra: Blues Interpretation
**Series:** Dharma Reborn, Volume 7
**Format:** Professional Audiobook/Print/eBook Cover
**Style:** Cinematic, Cool Jazz, Spiritual, Timeless
**Target Audience:** Spiritual seekers, literary fiction readers, blues/jazz enthusiasts

## CORE CONCEPT & DESIGN RATIONALE

### Concept Statement
"The Bodhisattva as Cool Cat." A cinematic fusion of a 1950s Blue Note jazz club aesthetic with the sacred geometry and golden luminosity of a Buddhist Pure Land. Vimalakirti is depicted not as an ancient religious figure, but as a timeless elder—a "man of the world" who transcends it.

### Design Philosophy
The cover must bridge two worlds:
1.  **The Dharma:** Represented by the "Great Golden Light," the lotus, and the sense of profound stillness.
2.  **The Blues:** Represented by the smoky indigo atmosphere, the chiaroscuro lighting, and the "Cool" aesthetic of the jazz age.

This is **Non-Duality in visual form**: Samsara (the smoky club) and Nirvana (the golden light) are not two different places.

## VISUAL ELEMENTS

### Color Palette
-   **Deep Indigo / Midnight Blue:** The "Blues" foundation.
-   **Burnished Gold / Amber:** The "Dharma" illumination.
-   **Smoke / Atmosphere:** The texture of the "Burning House" of the world.

### Typography (Recommended)
-   **Title:** Bold, condensed serif or sans-serif (e.g., *Oswald*, *Bebas Neue*, or a classic serif like *Bodoni*) in Gold or White.
-   **Subtitle:** "Blues Interpretation" in a smaller, lighter weight or script font to suggest the personal, vernacular touch.
