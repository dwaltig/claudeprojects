**The Vimalakirti Sutra: Blues Interpretation**
*The Dharma Reborn Series, Volume 7*

Vimalakirti isn’t a monk. He’s a wealthy householder in the city, sick with the sickness of the world. In this groundbreaking interpretation, the profound Mahayana masterpiece is reimagined through the soulful, gritty vernacular of the American Blues.

Vimalakirti is the original "Cool Cat" of the Dharma—teaching that Nirvana isn't an escape from the world, but the clarity right in the middle of the smoke.

When the Buddha's great disciples are too afraid to visit his sickbed, a dialogue unfolds that shatters every stiff, religious dualism. Silence becomes thunder. Sickness becomes a gate.

Translator William Altig renders these 14 chapters not as dry scripture, but as a living performance. This is the Dharma taking the stage in a smoky club at 3 AM, proving that the deepest truth often sings the Blues.

*Gate gate pāragate.* Gone beyond.
