# Chapter 10: Accumulated Fragrance Blues

**Blues Translation by Master John Kim**

---

## When's Lunch?

Right then, Śāriputra got to thinking: "Time for the midday meal's coming up. Where all these bodhisattvas gonna eat?"¹

Now Vimalakirti knew what he was thinking, and he said: "The Buddha taught eight liberations,² and you practicing them. You gonna mix up wanting food with hearing the Dharma? If you wanna eat, just wait a minute. I'm gonna give you food like you ain't never had."

---

## The Land Made of Fragrance

Then Vimalakirti went into deep meditation and, through his supernatural power, showed the whole assembly something in the direction above. Way up past forty-two Ganges-rivers worth of buddha-lands, there's a world called "Accumulated Fragrance."³ Its buddha is named Accumulated Fragrance,⁴ and he's there right now.

The fragrance of that land beats all the fragrances of humans and gods in every direction—it's the number one.⁵ That land ain't got no names like "śrāvaka" or "pratyekabuddha"—just a pure assembly of great bodhisattvas, and the Buddha teaches them Dharma.⁶

Everything in that realm is made of fragrance: fragrant pavilions, fragrant meditation paths, fragrant parks and gardens.⁷ The smell of their food spreads through countless worlds in all ten directions.

Right then, that buddha and the bodhisattvas were sitting down eating together. Various sons of the gods, all named "Fragrance-Adorned,"⁸ had generated the awakening mind and were making offerings to that buddha and all the bodhisattvas. The whole assembly here could see it all.

---

## Who's Gonna Go Get That Food?

Then Vimalakirti asked all the bodhisattvas: "Fellas! Who can go get rice from that buddha?"⁹

Because of Mañjuśrī's awesome power, everybody stayed quiet.¹⁰

Vimalakirti said: "Ain't this assembly ashamed?"

Mañjuśrī said: "Like the Buddha said, 'Don't look down on them that ain't learned yet.'"¹¹

---

## Creating a Messenger

Right then, Vimalakirti, without getting up from his seat, right in front of everybody, manifested a phantom bodhisattva¹²—with excellent marks and radiance, majestic virtue surpassing the whole assembly—and told him:

"Go on up, past forty-two Ganges-rivers worth of buddha-lands. There's a world called Accumulated Fragrance, and its buddha is named Accumulated Fragrance. He and the bodhisattvas are eating together right now. Go there and say for me: 'Vimalakirti bows his head at the World-Honored One's feet, pays infinite respects, asks how you doing—any sickness, any trouble, strength and spirit okay?—and he's asking for the leftover food from the World-Honored One's meal. He wants to do buddha-work in the Sahā world,¹³ so folks who like small teachings can open up to the great path, and also to spread the Tathāgata's fame everywhere.'"¹⁴

---

## The Journey

Then that phantom bodhisattva, right before everybody, rose up toward the upper direction. The whole assembly saw him go, saw him arrive at the Accumulated Fragrance realm, bow at that buddha's feet.¹⁵ They heard him say: "Vimalakirti bows his head at the World-Honored One's feet, pays infinite respects, asks how you doing—any sickness, any trouble, strength and spirit okay?—and he's asking for the leftover food from the World-Honored One's meal. He wants to do buddha-work in the Sahā world, so folks who like small teachings can open up to the great path, and also to spread the Tathāgata's fame everywhere."

Them great bodhisattvas, seeing the phantom, said in wonder: "Where'd this superior person come from? Where's this Sahā world? And what's 'liking small teachings' mean?"¹⁶ They asked the Buddha.

The Buddha told them: "Down below here, past forty-two Ganges-rivers worth of buddha-lands, there's a world called Sahā, and its buddha is named Śākyamuni—he's there right now. In the evil age of five turbidities,¹⁷ for folks who like small teachings, he lays out the Way. There's a bodhisattva there named Vimalakirti, dwelling in the Inconceivable Liberation, teaching Dharma to bodhisattvas. He sent this phantom here, praising my name and this land, so them bodhisattvas can increase their merit."¹⁸

Them bodhisattvas said: "What kind of person makes transformations like that? His virtue-power and fearlessness, his supernatural ability—so great!"

The Buddha said: "Extremely great! He sends phantoms in all ten directions, doing buddha-work to benefit beings."¹⁹

---

## The Fragrant Rice

Then the Tathāgata Accumulated Fragrance filled a bowl with assembled fragrant rice and gave it to the phantom bodhisattva.²⁰

Right then, nine million bodhisattvas spoke up together: "We wanna go to the Sahā world to make offerings to Śākyamuni Buddha and to see Vimalakirti and all them bodhisattvas!"²¹

The Buddha said: "You can go. But hold back the fragrance of your bodies—don't let those beings get confused and attached.²² And you better drop your original forms, so folks in that land seeking the bodhisattva path don't feel humiliated looking at you.²³ Also, don't go there thinking you're better, creating barriers. Why? The lands in all ten directions are just like empty space.²⁴ Also, buddhas who wanna transform folks who like small teachings don't fully show how pure their lands really are."²⁵

Then the phantom bodhisattva, with the rice bowl, together with the nine million bodhisattvas, through the Buddha's awesome power and Vimalakirti's power, suddenly vanished from that world. In just a moment, they got to Vimalakirti's house.

---

## The Big Meal

Right then, Vimalakirti manifested nine million lion seats, magnificent like before, and all the bodhisattvas sat on them.²⁶

The phantom bodhisattva gave the full bowl of fragrant rice to Vimalakirti. The fragrance of that rice spread through the whole city of Vaiśālī and the whole billion-world system.²⁷

When them brahmins and householders of Vaiśālī smelled that fragrance, their bodies and minds felt good, and they said it was wonderful!²⁸ Then the elder chief Moon-Canopy,²⁹ with eighty-four thousand folks, came into Vimalakirti's house. Seeing all them bodhisattvas in that room, seeing the lion seats so high and magnificent, they was all delighted. They bowed to the bodhisattvas and the great disciples, then stood to one side. Earth spirits, sky spirits, and gods of the desire and form realms—smelling that fragrance—they all came to Vimalakirti's house too.

Then Vimalakirti told Śāriputra and the other great śrāvakas: "Fellas! Eat up. This is the Tathāgata's sweet-dew rice,³⁰ soaked in great compassion. Don't eat with a limited mind, or it won't digest."³¹

Some śrāvakas thought: "This rice is so little, and this assembly so big—how everybody gonna eat?"

The phantom bodhisattva said: "Don't measure the Tathāgata's immeasurable merit and wisdom with śrāvaka small virtue and small wisdom!³² The four oceans might dry up, but this rice won't run out! If everybody ate, kneading portions big as Mount Sumeru, for a whole kalpa, still couldn't finish it. Why? The leftovers of one complete in inexhaustible morality, concentration, wisdom, liberation, and the knowledge of liberation—can't be exhausted."³³

So the rice in the bowl satisfied the whole assembly and still wasn't diminished.³⁴ All the bodhisattvas, śrāvakas, gods, and humans who ate that rice felt bodily ease and bliss—like bodhisattvas in the Land of Joy and Adornment.³⁵ From all their pores came wonderful fragrance, like the fragrance of trees in the Accumulated Fragrance land.

---

## How They Teach Over There

Then Vimalakirti asked them fragrance-land bodhisattvas: "How does the Tathāgata Accumulated Fragrance teach the Dharma?"³⁶

Those bodhisattvas said: "In our land, the Tathāgata don't teach with words. He just uses assembled fragrances to help gods and humans enter disciplined practice.³⁷ The bodhisattvas each sit under fragrant trees. Smelling that wonderful fragrance, they immediately get the samādhi of the Treasury of All Virtues.³⁸ Them that get this samādhi—all the bodhisattva virtues are complete in them."

Them bodhisattvas asked Vimalakirti: "How does the World-Honored One Śākyamuni teach the Dharma now?"³⁹

---

## Teaching the Hard-Cases

Vimalakirti said: "Folks in this land are stubborn and hard to transform.⁴⁰ So the Buddha speaks harsh words to discipline them. He talks about hell, the animal realm, the hungry ghost realm, all them difficult places, all them places where fools get born.⁴¹ He talks about wrong body action and what happens from it. Wrong speech and what happens. Wrong thinking and what happens. Killing and what happens. Stealing and what happens. Sexual misconduct and what happens. Lying and what happens. Divisive talk and what happens. Harsh words and what happens. Idle chatter and what happens. Covetousness and what happens. Anger and what happens. Wrong views and what happens.⁴² Stinginess and what happens. Breaking precepts and what happens. Anger and what happens. Laziness and what happens. Distracted mind and what happens. Stupidity and what happens. Precepts—keeping them, breaking them. What you should do, what you shouldn't do. Obstruction and non-obstruction. Transgression and getting free of transgression. Purity and defilement. Defiled and undefiled. Wrong paths and right paths. Conditioned and unconditioned. The world and nirvāṇa.⁴³

"These beings are hard to transform—their minds are like monkeys.⁴⁴ So he uses all kinds of dharmas to control their minds—only then can they be disciplined. It's like fierce elephants and horses that won't be tamed till the whip goes to the bone—only then they get disciplined. Same with these stubborn, hard-to-transform beings: only with all kinds of bitter, harsh words can they enter disciplined practice."⁴⁵

---

## They Honor Us

When them bodhisattvas heard this, they all said: "Unprecedented! The World-Honored One Śākyamuni Buddha hides his immeasurable sovereign powers and uses the dharmas little folks like to liberate beings. And these bodhisattvas too—they labor and humble themselves with immeasurable great compassion, getting born in this buddha-land."⁴⁶

Vimalakirti said: "The great compassion of this land's bodhisattvas toward all beings is firm and solid, truly like you say. But what they accomplish in ONE LIFETIME benefiting beings here exceeds what your land accomplishes in a HUNDRED THOUSAND KALPAS of practice.⁴⁷ Why? Because this Sahā world got ten wholesome dharmas that the other pure lands don't have.⁴⁸ What are the ten?

1. Using giving to gather the poor
2. Using pure precepts to gather them that break the rules
3. Using patience to gather the angry
4. Using vigor to gather the lazy
5. Using meditation to gather the distracted
6. Using wisdom to gather the foolish
7. Speaking dharmas that remove difficulties to help them in the eight difficulties
8. Using Mahāyāna dharma to help them that like the Hīnayāna
9. Using various good roots to aid them without virtue
10. Always using the four ways of attracting to accomplish beings

That's the ten."⁴⁹

---

## How to Live Clean

Them bodhisattvas asked: "How many dharmas does a bodhisattva gotta accomplish to act blamelessly in this world and get born in a pure land?"⁵⁰

Vimalakirti said: "A bodhisattva gotta accomplish eight dharmas to act blamelessly in this world and get born in a pure land.⁵¹ What are the eight?

1. Benefit beings without hoping for payback⁵²
2. Take on all the suffering for all beings, and give away all your accumulated merit⁵³
3. Have an equal mind toward all beings—humble, without obstruction⁵⁴
4. Look at all bodhisattvas like you'd look at a buddha⁵⁵
5. Hear sutras you ain't heard before without doubting⁵⁶
6. Don't oppose the śrāvakas⁵⁷
7. Don't be jealous of others' offerings, don't be proud of your own gains—train your mind in the midst of all this⁵⁸
8. Always examine your own faults, don't blame others' shortcomings—constantly with one mind seek all virtues⁵⁹

That's the eight."

---

## Awakening Everywhere

When Vimalakirti and Mañjuśrī taught this Dharma to the great assembly, a hundred thousand gods and humans generated the mind of supreme enlightenment, and ten thousand bodhisattvas got the patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas.⁶⁰

## Theological Note

### The Fragrance Teaching

This chapter shows another way the Dharma works. In pure lands, no words needed—fragrance teaches directly. Just breathing in the scent, you get wisdom. That's how different buddha-lands can be.

But here in Sahā, we need words. Hard words. Lists of what goes wrong and what happens. Fear and consequence. That's what works on us hard-headed folks.

### The Sahā Advantage

The pure-land bodhisattvas honor us! Why? Because one lifetime of practice in this mess is worth more than a hundred thousand kalpas of easy practice in paradise. The difficulty IS the advantage.

The Blues knows this. Life's troubles ain't just troubles—they're the fast track. Every hardship is an opportunity that pure-land beings don't have.

### Examine Yourself

The eight dharmas end with: always examine your own faults, don't blame others' shortcomings. That's the whole thing right there. Stop looking out the window; look in the mirror.

# Chapter 11: Bodhisattva Practices Blues

**Blues Translation by Master John Kim**

## The Grand Arrival

Right then, while the Buddha was teaching in the Āmra Garden,¹ the ground suddenly got vast and magnificent, and everybody in the assembly turned golden.²

Ānanda said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! What's the reason for this sign? This place suddenly got vast and adorned, and the whole assembly turned golden."

The Buddha told Ānanda: "It's because Vimalakirti and Mañjuśrī, with all them folks reverently surrounding them, intend to come here. This sign appeared first to announce them."³

---

## Vimalakirti Comes Flying In

Then Vimalakirti said to Mañjuśrī: "Let's go see the Buddha together, making offerings with the bodhisattvas."⁴

Mañjuśrī said: "Excellent! Let's go! Now's the time."⁵

Vimalakirti then, through his supernatural power, held the ENTIRE great assembly together with them lion seats in his right palm and went to where the Buddha was.⁶ When he got there, he set them on the ground, bowed his head at the Buddha's feet, walked around him seven times on the right, then stood to one side with palms together.

All the bodhisattvas got up from their seats, bowed their heads at the Buddha's feet, also walked around seven times, and stood to one side.⁷ The great disciples, Śakras, Brahmās, and Four Heavenly Kings also got up, bowed at the Buddha's feet, and stood to one side.⁸

---

## The Buddha Greets Them

Then the World-Honored One, according to the Dharma, greeted all the bodhisattvas and had them sit again. When the assembly was settled, the Buddha asked Śāriputra: "Did you see what the great bodhisattvas can do with their supernatural powers?"⁹

"I sure did!"

"What do you think?"

"World-Honored One! What I saw is inconceivable—can't be grasped by thought, can't be measured by any standard."¹⁰

---

## What's That Smell?

Right then, Ānanda said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! This fragrance I'm smelling—never smelled nothing like it before. What is it?"¹¹

The Buddha told Ānanda: "It's the fragrance from them bodhisattvas' pores."¹²

Then Śāriputra told Ānanda: "Our pores are putting out this fragrance too."¹³

Ānanda asked: "Where'd this come from?"

Śāriputra said: "The elder Vimalakirti brought leftover rice from the Buddha of the Accumulated Fragrance land. Everybody who ate in his house—all their pores smell like this."¹⁴

---

## How Long's It Gonna Last?

Ānanda asked Vimalakirti: "How long's this fragrance gonna stay?"

Vimalakirti said: "Till this rice is digested."¹⁵

Ānanda asked: "How long till this rice is digested?"

Vimalakirti said: "This rice takes seven days to digest normally.¹⁶ But Ānanda, there's more. If a śrāvaka who ain't entered the correct position yet eats this rice, it won't digest till he enters that position.¹⁷ If somebody already in the correct position eats it, won't digest till he gets liberation of mind.¹⁸ If somebody who ain't generated the Mahāyāna mind yet eats it, won't digest till he generates that mind.¹⁹ If somebody who already generated that mind eats it, won't digest till he gets the patient acceptance of the non-arising of dharmas.²⁰ If somebody who already got that patience eats it, won't digest till he reaches the one-more-lifetime stage.²¹

"It's like a medicine called 'Supreme Taste.'²² Whoever takes it—all the body's poisons get eliminated, and only then it's digested. This rice is the same—it gets rid of all the poisons of affliction, and only then it's digested."²³

---

## The Rice Does Buddha-Work

Ānanda said to the Buddha: "Unprecedented! World-Honored One! This fragrant rice can do buddha-work!"²⁴

The Buddha said: "Exactly so! Ānanda! Some buddha-lands use the Buddha's light to do buddha-work.²⁵ Some use bodhisattvas to do buddha-work. Some use phantom beings the buddha created to do buddha-work.²⁶ Some use the bodhi tree to do buddha-work. Some use the Buddha's robes and bedding to do buddha-work.²⁷ Some use food to do buddha-work. Some use gardens and groves and pavilions to do buddha-work.²⁸ Some use the thirty-two marks and eighty characteristics to do buddha-work. Some use the Buddha's body to do buddha-work.²⁹ Some use EMPTY SPACE to do buddha-work.³⁰ Sentient beings, according to these conditions, enter disciplined practice.

"Some use dreams, illusions, shadows, echoes, reflections, the moon in water, heat mirages³¹—analogies like that—to do buddha-work. Some use sound, language, and letters to do buddha-work.³² Some pure buddha-lands use silence—no words, no explanations, no indications, no cognition, no action, no conditioning—to do buddha-work.³³

"So, Ānanda! All the conduct and actions of the buddhas, all they undertake—NONE of it ain't buddha-work.³⁴

---

## Even Afflictions Are Buddha-Work

"Ānanda! There's these four māras and eighty-four thousand afflictions³⁵ through which sentient beings get exhausted. The buddhas use PRECISELY THESE DHARMAS to do buddha-work.³⁶ That's called entering the Dharma-gate of all buddhas.

"When bodhisattvas enter this gate: if they see a pure beautiful buddha-land, they don't get happy, don't covet, don't get proud. If they see an impure buddha-land, they don't get sad, don't get stuck, don't sink.³⁷ They just generate a pure mind toward the buddhas with joy and reverence—unprecedented!—that the buddhas, whose merit is equal, manifest different buddha-lands to transform sentient beings.³⁸

"Ānanda! You see the various buddha-lands—the ground differs, but empty space don't differ. Same way, when you see the various buddha-bodies—they differ, but their unobstructed wisdom don't differ.³⁹

---

## All Buddhas Are Equal

"Ānanda! The color-bodies, majestic marks, lineage, morality, concentration, wisdom, liberation, knowledge-of-liberation, powers, fearlessnesses, unique dharmas, great compassion, great loving-kindness, dignified conduct, lifespan, teaching sentient beings, purifying buddha-lands, accomplishing all buddha-dharmas⁴⁰—all these are EQUAL among the buddhas. That's why they're called *Samyak-saṃbuddha*, called *Tathāgata*, called *Buddha*.⁴¹

"Ānanda! If I explained the meaning of these three phrases broadly, you—even with a kalpa-length life—couldn't fully receive it. Even if the whole billion-world system was filled with beings like Ānanda—foremost in hearing, with complete memory—even they, in a kalpa-length life, couldn't receive it. So, Ānanda! The buddhas' supreme enlightenment got no limit; their wisdom and eloquence are inconceivable."⁴²

---

## Ānanda Gets Humble

Ānanda said to the Buddha: "From today on, I won't dare to think of myself as one who's heard much."⁴³

The Buddha told Ānanda: "Don't give rise to a retreating mind! Why? I said among śrāvakas YOU'RE the foremost in hearing—I didn't say that about bodhisattvas. Stop, Ānanda! Wise folk shouldn't try to limit bodhisattvas.⁴⁴ The depths of the ocean can be measured, but the meditation, wisdom, dhāraṇī, and eloquence of bodhisattvas can't be measured.⁴⁵

"Ānanda! Set aside everything bodhisattvas do. Just this ONE INSTANCE of supernatural power Vimalakirti displayed—all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas, even in a hundred thousand kalpas, using all their transformative power, couldn't do it."⁴⁶

---

## The Visitors Repent

Right then, the bodhisattvas who came from the Accumulated Fragrance world joined palms and said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! When we first saw this land, we had lowly thoughts. Now we repent and drop that attitude.⁴⁷ Why? The skillful means of all buddhas are inconceivable. To liberate sentient beings, they show buddha-lands according to what's appropriate.⁴⁸ World-Honored One! Please give us a small teaching, so when we go back to our land, we can think on the Tathāgata."⁴⁹

---

## The Teaching: Exhaustible and Inexhaustible

The Buddha told them bodhisattvas: "There's a liberation Dharma-gate called 'Exhaustible and Inexhaustible.'⁵⁰ Y'all should learn it. What's 'exhaustible'? Conditioned dharmas.⁵¹ What's 'inexhaustible'? Unconditioned dharmas.⁵² Bodhisattvas don't exhaust the conditioned, and don't dwell in the unconditioned.⁵³

---

## Not Exhausting the Conditioned

"What's 'not exhausting the conditioned'?⁵⁴ It means:

- Don't abandon great loving-kindness, don't forsake great compassion⁵⁵
- Deeply generate the mind seeking all-wisdom, never forgetting it⁵⁶
- Teach and transform sentient beings without ever getting tired⁵⁷
- With the four means of attraction, always think of practicing them⁵⁸
- Protect the true Dharma without sparing body or life⁵⁹
- Plant all roots of goodness without getting tired⁶⁰
- Mind always settled in skillful dedication⁶¹
- Seek the Dharma without slacking⁶²
- Teach the Dharma without stinginess⁶³
- Diligently make offerings to the buddhas⁶⁴

"So: entering birth-and-death without fear; regarding honor and disgrace, no sorrow or joy; not slighting them that ain't learned, respecting them that have learned like they was buddhas; for them fallen in afflictions, generating correct mindfulness; regarding solitary joy, not thinking it's precious; not attached to your own joy, rejoicing in others' joy.⁶⁵

"Regarding meditation absorptions, think of them like being in hell; regarding birth-and-death, think of it like being in a garden;⁶⁶ see them that come seeking as good teachers; giving up all possessions, think of it as accomplishing all-wisdom;⁶⁷ see them that break precepts, give rise to protective thoughts; regarding the pāramitās, think of them as your parents; regarding the factors of enlightenment, think of them as your relatives.⁶⁸

"Generate roots of goodness without limit; use all the adornments of pure lands to accomplish your own buddha-land;⁶⁹ practice unlimited giving to perfect the marks; eliminate all evils to purify body, speech, and mind;⁷⁰ face birth-and-death for countless kalpas with a courageous mind; hear of buddhas' immeasurable virtues with unflagging resolve; use the sword of wisdom to cut through affliction-thieves;⁷¹ emerge from aggregates, realms, and sense-bases to carry sentient beings, forever liberating them; use great vigor to defeat the māra armies;⁷² constantly seek non-conceptual wisdom that practices reality; regarding worldly dharmas, few desires and knowing contentment; regarding transcendent dharmas, seeking without satiation;⁷³ not abandoning worldly dharmas, not destroying dignified conduct, yet able to accord with custom; generate supernatural wisdom to guide sentient beings; attain memory and dhāraṇī so what's heard ain't forgot;⁷⁴ skillfully distinguish the faculties of beings, cut their doubts; with joyful eloquence, teach Dharma without obstruction; purify the ten wholesome paths, receive the blessings of gods and humans;⁷⁵ cultivate the four immeasurables, open the path to Brahmā; encourage beings to teach Dharma, rejoice in and praise the good, attain the Buddha's voice; train body, speech, and mind well to attain Buddha's dignified conduct;⁷⁶ deeply cultivate wholesome dharmas, advancing and surpassing; use the Mahāyāna teaching to accomplish the bodhisattva saṅgha; with unscattered mind, don't lose wholesome dharmas.⁷⁷

"Practicing like this is called 'the bodhisattva not exhausting the conditioned.'⁷⁸

---

## Not Dwelling in the Unconditioned

"What's 'not dwelling in the unconditioned'?⁷⁹ It means:

- Cultivate emptiness, but don't take emptiness as realization⁸⁰
- Cultivate signlessness and wishlessness, but don't take these as realization⁸¹
- Cultivate non-arising, but don't take non-arising as realization⁸²

"Contemplate impermanence, but don't weary of roots of goodness;⁸³ contemplate the suffering of the world, but don't hate birth-and-death;⁸⁴ contemplate non-self, but teach others without getting tired;⁸⁵ contemplate quiescence, but don't be eternally quiescent;⁸⁶ contemplate renunciation, but cultivate good with body and mind;⁸⁷ contemplate non-destination, but turn toward wholesome dharmas;⁸⁸ contemplate non-arising, but use arising-dharma to carry all beings;⁸⁹ contemplate freedom from defilement, but don't cut off all defilements;⁹⁰ contemplate non-action, but use action-dharma to teach and transform beings;⁹¹ contemplate emptiness and non-existence, but don't abandon great compassion;⁹² contemplate the position of the true Dharma, but don't follow the Hīnayāna;⁹³ contemplate all dharmas as false, without solidity, without person, without self, without characteristics—yet the original vow not fulfilled means merit, meditation, and wisdom ain't made empty.⁹⁴

"Cultivating like this is called 'the bodhisattva not dwelling in the unconditioned.'⁹⁵

---

## The Balance

"Furthermore: got merit?—don't dwell in unconditioned. Got wisdom?—don't exhaust conditioned.⁹⁶ Got great compassion?—don't dwell in unconditioned. Got original vow to fulfill?—don't exhaust conditioned.⁹⁷ Gathering Dharma-medicine?—don't dwell in unconditioned. Dispensing medicine according to need?—don't exhaust conditioned.⁹⁸ Know the illnesses of beings?—don't dwell in unconditioned. Extinguish the illnesses of beings?—don't exhaust conditioned.⁹⁹

"All you noble bodhisattvas! Cultivating this Dharma—not exhausting the conditioned, not dwelling in the unconditioned—that's the 'Exhaustible and Inexhaustible Liberation Dharma-Gate.'¹⁰⁰ Y'all should learn it."¹⁰¹

---

## They Head Home

Right then, them bodhisattvas, hearing this teaching, were all greatly delighted. They scattered wonderful flowers of various colors and fragrances through the whole billion-world system, making offerings to the Buddha and this sutra and all the bodhisattvas.¹⁰² Then they bowed their heads at the Buddha's feet, exclaiming at what they never encountered: "Śākyamuni Buddha can do such skillful means here!"¹⁰³

After saying that, they suddenly vanished, returning to their land.¹⁰⁴

## Theological Note

### Buddha-Work Through Everything

This chapter shows that ANYTHING can be a teaching. Light, bodies, gardens, food, silence—everything becomes a vehicle for awakening. Even the māras and afflictions become buddha-work when buddhas use them.

### The Middle Way of Engaged Practice

The "Exhaustible and Inexhaustible" teaching is the practical non-duality of the Vimalakirti Sutra. Bodhisattvas neither abandon the conditioned world (getting lost in worldly activity) nor dwell in the unconditioned (getting stuck in transcendent bliss). They stay engaged with full wisdom, act with full emptiness.

The Blues walks this same line—in the world but not of it, suffering with dignity, empty but fully alive.

## How You Gonna See the Buddha?

Right then, the World-Honored One asked Vimalakirti: "When you wanna see the Tathāgata, how do you view him?"¹

Vimalakirti said: "Just like I view the reality of my own body, I view the Buddha the same way.² I view the Tathāgata: not coming from the past, not going to the future, not abiding in the present.³

"I don't view form, don't view the suchness of form, don't view the nature of form.⁴ I don't view feeling, perception, formations, or consciousness; don't view their suchness, don't view their nature.⁵

"Not arising from the four elements, same as empty space.⁶ The six sense-bases got no accumulation—eye, ear, nose, tongue, body, and mind already passed.⁷ Not in the three realms, three defilements already gone.⁸ According with the three gates of liberation, got the three insights, equal to ignorance.⁹

"Neither one characteristic nor different characteristics; neither self-characteristic nor other-characteristic; neither without characteristic nor grasping characteristic.¹⁰ Not this shore, not that shore, not the middle of the stream—yet transforming beings.¹¹ Viewing quiescence, yet not eternally quiet.¹²

"Not this, not that; not using this, not using that.¹³ Not knowable by knowing, not recognizable by recognition.¹⁴ Without darkness, without light; without name, without characteristic; without strength, without weakness.¹⁵ Neither pure nor defiled; not in any location, yet not apart from location.¹⁶ Neither conditioned nor unconditioned.¹⁷ Without indication, without explanation.¹⁸

"Neither giving nor stingy; neither moral nor immoral; neither patient nor angry; neither vigorous nor lazy; neither concentrated nor distracted; neither wise nor foolish.¹⁹ Neither truthful nor deceitful; neither coming nor going; neither emerging nor entering.²⁰

"All verbal paths are CUT OFF.²¹ Neither a field of merit nor not a field of merit; neither worthy of offerings nor not worthy of offerings.²² Neither graspable nor abandonable; neither with characteristic nor without.²³

"Same as the true limit, equal to dharma-nature.²⁴ Beyond designation, beyond measurement, surpassing all measurement.²⁵ Neither great nor small; neither visible nor audible; neither perceivable nor knowable.²⁶ Free from all bonds, equal to all wisdom, same as all sentient beings.²⁷ Upon all dharmas, no discrimination.²⁸

"All is without failure, without defilement, without affliction, without action, without arising, without extinction.²⁹ Without fear, without sorrow, without joy, without weariness, without attachment.³⁰ Without what has been, without what will be, without what is now.³¹ Not expressible through any words at all.³²

"World-Honored One! The body of the Tathāgata is like THIS. Viewing thus is called CORRECT viewing.³³ Viewing any other way is WRONG viewing."³⁴

---

## Where'd You Come From?

Right then, Śāriputra asked Vimalakirti: "Where'd you die to be reborn here?"³⁵

Vimalakirti said: "The dharma you got—does it have death and rebirth?"³⁶

Śāriputra said: "No death and rebirth."³⁷

Vimalakirti said: "If all dharmas got no characteristic of death and rebirth, why you asking: 'Where'd you die to be reborn here?' What do you think? If a magician makes illusory men and women—do they die and get reborn?"³⁸

Śāriputra said: "No death and rebirth."

Vimalakirti said: "Ain't you heard the Buddha say all dharmas are like illusions?"³⁹

Śāriputra answered: "Yeah, so it is."

Vimalakirti said: "If all dharmas are like illusions, why you asking: 'Where'd you die to be reborn here?'⁴⁰ Śāriputra! Death is the characteristic of the false dharma of decay and destruction.⁴¹ Birth is the characteristic of the false dharma of continuity.⁴² The bodhisattva, though dying, don't exhaust roots of goodness; though being born, don't increase evils."⁴³

---

## Where Vimalakirti Came From

Right then, the Buddha told Śāriputra: "There's a land called Abhirati,⁴⁴ whose buddha is named Akṣobhya.⁴⁵ Vimalakirti died in that land and was reborn here."⁴⁶

Śāriputra said: "Unprecedented! World-Honored One! This person was able to leave a pure land and come to ENJOY this place full of anger and harm."⁴⁷

---

## Like the Sun

Vimalakirti said to Śāriputra: "What do you think? When the sun's light comes out, does it unite with darkness?"⁴⁸

Śāriputra answered: "No! When the sun's light comes out, there ain't no darkness."⁴⁹

Vimalakirti said: "Then why does the sun travel through this world?"⁵⁰

Śāriputra answered: "To illuminate with light, to get rid of the darkness."⁵¹

Vimalakirti said: "The bodhisattva is just like that! Though born in an impure buddha-land to transform beings, he don't unite with the foolish darkness.⁵² He just extinguishes the darkness of beings' afflictions."⁵³

---

## Show Us That World

Right then, everybody in the assembly was thirsting to see the Abhirati world, the Tathāgata Akṣobhya, and his assembly of bodhisattvas and disciples.⁵⁴

The Buddha knew what they was all thinking and told Vimalakirti: "Good man! For this assembly, show them the Abhirati world, the Tathāgata Akṣobhya, and his bodhisattvas and disciples. They all wanna see."⁵⁵

---

## Vimalakirti's Thought

Then Vimalakirti thought: "Without getting up from my seat, I'm gonna grab the Abhirati world—its mountains and rivers and streams and valleys and oceans, Mount Sumeru and the sun and moon and stars, the palaces of gods and dragons and spirits, the bodhisattva and disciple assemblies, the cities and villages and towns, the men and women big and small, and even the Tathāgata Akṣobhya himself, along with the bodhi tree and the wonderful lotus flowers that do buddha-work in ten directions—and the three jeweled stairways from here up to the Thirty-Three Heaven, by which the gods come down to pay respects to Akṣobhya Buddha and hear the Dharma, and by which people ascend to see those gods.⁵⁶

"That whole world, with all its merit—from the highest heaven down to the water-boundary.⁵⁷ Using my right hand, I'm gonna cut it off and bring it here, like holding a garland of flowers to show everybody."⁵⁸

Having thought this, he entered samādhi and manifested supernatural power. With his right hand, he cut off the Abhirati world and put it in this land.⁵⁹

---

## They Notice Over There

Them bodhisattvas, disciples, and gods who had supernatural powers in that land all cried out: "Who's taking us?! World-Honored One! Please protect us!"⁶⁰

The Tathāgata Akṣobhya said: "It ain't me doing this. It's Vimalakirti's supernatural power."⁶¹

The rest who hadn't got supernatural powers didn't even know where they was being taken.⁶² The Abhirati world, though it entered this land, neither increased nor decreased.⁶³ And this world wasn't cramped—it stayed the same as before.⁶⁴

---

## Look at That!

Right then, Śākyamuni Buddha told the great assembly: "All of you, observe the Abhirati world, the Tathāgata Akṣobhya. That land is magnificently adorned, the bodhisattvas' practice is pure, the disciples are immaculate."⁶⁵

Everybody said: "Yes, we see it!"

The Buddha said: "If bodhisattvas wanna get such a pure buddha-land, they should practice the path the Tathāgata Akṣobhya practices."⁶⁶

---

## Mass Awakening

When this Abhirati world was shown, in this Sahā world fourteen nayutas of folks generated the mind of supreme enlightenment, all aspiring to be born in the Abhirati buddha-land.⁶⁷ Śākyamuni Buddha right then prophesied: "Y'all will be born in that land."⁶⁸

Then the Abhirati world, having done its benefit work in this land, went back to its original place. The whole assembly saw it.⁶⁹

---

## The Benefits of This Sūtra

The Buddha asked Śāriputra: "Did you see this Abhirati world and the Tathāgata Akṣobhya?"⁷⁰

Śāriputra said: "Yeah, I saw. World-Honored One! May all sentient beings get pure lands like Akṣobhya's and get supernatural powers like Vimalakirti's!⁷¹

"World-Honored One! We got excellent benefit, having seen this person, got close to him, and made offerings.⁷² All them beings, whether now while the Buddha's here or after the Buddha's nirvāṇa,⁷³ who hear this sūtra will also get excellent benefit. How much more so them that, having heard, believe and understand, accept and uphold, read and recite, and explain it!⁷⁴

"Them that get this sūtra in their hands have already got the treasury of the Dharma jewel.⁷⁵ Them that read and recite and explain its meaning, practicing according to its teaching, are protected by all buddhas.⁷⁶ Them that make offerings to such persons should know they're making offerings to the Buddha.⁷⁷ Them that write and preserve this sūtra-scroll—in their dwelling the Tathāgata is present.⁷⁸

"Them that hear this sūtra and can rejoice—these folks will get all-wisdom.⁷⁹ Them that can believe and understand this sūtra, even just one four-line verse,⁸⁰ and explain it to others—know that this person has received the prediction of supreme enlightenment."⁸¹

## Theological Note

### How to See the Buddha

Vimalakirti's description is the most complete negation in the whole sūtra. Every predicate denied, every category transcended. The Buddha can't be located, measured, grasped, or described—yet is not nothing. The Blues knows about this—the deepest truth can't be put in words.

### Vimalakirti's Origin

He came from Abhirati—Akṣobhya's pure land—and CHOSE to be here. Like the sun traveling through darkness to dispel it, the bodhisattva enters the impure world to shine. The darkness don't stain the light.

### Bringing a Whole World Here

When Vimalakirti brings Abhirati into our world, neither land is cramped or changed. This is ultimate non-obstruction—space ain't limited, worlds ain't separate. The Blues knows this too—what you're looking for ain't somewhere else, it's right here.

## Śakra Gives Praise

Right then, Śakra, the Lord of the Gods,¹ said to the Buddha in the assembly: "World-Honored One! I've heard hundreds of thousands of sūtras from you and from Mañjuśrī, but I never heard an inconceivable sūtra like this—one with sovereign supernatural powers that establishes the characteristic of ultimate reality.²

"The way I understand what you're teaching, if there's beings who hear this sūtra and believe it, understand it, accept it, uphold it, and recite it—they're DEFINITELY gonna get this Dharma, no doubt.³ And even more so those who practice what it teaches!⁴ These people will close the gates to evil places and open the gates to goodness.⁵ They'll always be protected by all buddhas.⁶ They'll subdue wrong teachings, destroy the māra-enemies, cultivate bodhi, settle in the awakening-place, and walk in the Tathāgata's footsteps.⁷

"World-Honored One! If there's those who accept, uphold, read, recite, and practice what this sūtra teaches, me and my crew will make offerings and serve them.⁸ Wherever there's villages, cities, mountain forests, or wilderness where this sūtra is, me and my crew will go there to hear the Dharma. Them that don't believe yet, I'll cause to believe. Them that already believe, I'll protect."⁹

---

## The Buddha Says Right On

The Buddha said: "Excellent! Excellent! Lord of the Gods!¹⁰ What you said—I rejoice with you.¹¹ This sūtra broadly teaches the inconceivable supreme enlightenment of all buddhas—past, future, and present.¹²

"So, Lord of the Gods! If good men or women accept, uphold, read, recite, and make offerings to this sūtra, they're making offerings to past, future, and present buddhas.¹³

"Lord of the Gods! Say the whole billion-world system was filled with tathāgatas—many as sugarcane stalks, bamboo, rice plants, hemp, or a thick forest.¹⁴ Say good men or women, for a kalpa or less, reverently honored, praised, and made offerings to them, giving them everything comfortable.¹⁵ And after them buddhas died, for each one they built a seven-jeweled stūpa over their relics—the stūpa covering all four continents, high as the Brahmā Heaven, magnificently adorned with banners—and with all flowers, fragrances, necklaces, banners, and the finest music, for a kalpa or less, made offerings to them.¹⁶

"Lord of the Gods! What do you think? Would the merit this person planted be great or not?"¹⁷

---

## Śakra Says Yeah

Śakra said: "Very great! World-Honored One! If you talked about this merit for a hundred thousand million kalpas, you couldn't finish."¹⁸

---

## But This Is Greater

The Buddha told the Lord of the Gods: "You should know: if good men or women hear this sūtra of Inconceivable Liberation,¹⁹ and believe it, understand it, accept it, uphold it, read it, and practice it—their merit EXCEEDS that.²⁰

"Why? The bodhi of ALL BUDDHAS is born from this.²¹ The characteristic of bodhi can't be limited. So its merit can't be measured."²²

---

## The Story of Prince Moon-Canopy

The Buddha told the Lord of the Gods: "In the immeasurably distant past, beyond countless kalpas,²³ there was a buddha named Medicine-King Tathāgata²⁴—the whole ten names.²⁵

"His world was called Great Adornment.²⁶ His kalpa was called Adornment.²⁷ That buddha's lifespan was twenty small kalpas.²⁸ His śrāvaka assembly was thirty-six thousand million nayutas.²⁹ His bodhisattva assembly was twelve billion.³⁰

"Lord of the Gods! At that time, there was a wheel-turning sage-king named Jewel-Canopy,³¹ complete with seven treasures, ruling all four continents. That king had a thousand sons, upright and brave, able to subdue enemies.³²

"At that time, Jewel-Canopy and his folks made offerings to the Tathāgata Medicine-King, giving everything comfortable for five full kalpas.³³ After five kalpas, he told his thousand sons: 'Y'all also should make offerings to the Buddha with profound mind, like I did.'

"Then the thousand sons, obeying their daddy, made offerings to the Tathāgata Medicine-King for another five full kalpas.³⁴

"One son, named Moon-Canopy,³⁵ sat alone thinking: 'Could there be any offering that beats this?'³⁶

"Through the Buddha's supernatural power, a god in the sky said: 'Good man! Dharma-offering beats all offerings!'³⁷

"Moon-Canopy right away asked: 'What's Dharma-offering?'³⁸

"The god said: 'Go ask the Tathāgata Medicine-King. He'll explain Dharma-offering for you.'³⁹

---

## What Is Dharma-Offering?

"Then Prince Moon-Canopy went to the Tathāgata Medicine-King, bowed at his feet, stood to one side, and said: 'World-Honored One! Among all offerings, Dharma-offering is supreme.⁴⁰ What is Dharma-offering?'

"The Buddha said: 'Good man! Dharma-offering means:⁴¹

"'The profound sūtras taught by all buddhas—sūtras the whole world finds hard to believe, hard to accept;⁴² subtle, hard to see, pure and undefiled;⁴³ not something you can just THINK your way into;⁴⁴ contained in the bodhisattva's Dharma-treasury, sealed with the dhāraṇī seal;⁴⁵ reaching non-retrogression, accomplishing the six perfections;⁴⁶ skillfully distinguishing meaning, according with bodhi-dharma, supreme among all sūtras;⁴⁷ entering great compassion, apart from māra-stuff and wrong views;⁴⁸ according with dependent origination;⁴⁹ without self, without person, without sentient being, without lifespan;⁵⁰ empty, signless, wishless, non-arising;⁵¹ enabling beings to sit on the awakening-place and turn the Dharma-wheel,⁵² praised by gods, dragons, and gandharvas;⁵³ enabling beings to enter the Buddha's Dharma-treasury, gathering all the wisdom of sages;⁵⁴ teaching the bodhisattvas' path;⁵⁵ relying on the meaning of reality's characteristic;⁵⁶ clearly saying impermanence, suffering, non-self, and quiescence;⁵⁷ able to rescue all who violate precepts,⁵⁸ feared by māras and wrong teachers and them attached to grasping,⁵⁹ praised by all buddhas and sages;⁶⁰ turning from the suffering of birth-death, showing nirvāṇa's joy;⁶¹ taught by all buddhas of ten directions and three times.⁶²

"'If somebody hears such sūtras, believes them, understands them, accepts them, upholds them, and recites them, using skillful means for beings to distinguish and explain them,⁶³ clearly revealing and guarding the Dharma⁶⁴—THAT'S Dharma-offering.

---

## Practice As Taught

"'Furthermore: regarding all dharmas, practicing as taught,⁶⁵ according with the twelve factors of dependent origination,⁶⁶ apart from all wrong views,⁶⁷ getting the patience of non-arising,⁶⁸ definitely realizing there's no self and no sentient being,⁶⁹ yet regarding cause, condition, and result without contradiction;⁷⁰ apart from all self-possession,⁷¹ relying on meaning not words,⁷² relying on wisdom not consciousness,⁷³ relying on sūtras of definitive meaning not interpretable ones,⁷⁴ relying on Dharma not on persons;⁷⁵ according with the characteristic of dharmas, not entering, not attaining;⁷⁶ because ignorance is ultimately extinguished, formations are ultimately extinguished, on up to: because birth is ultimately extinguished, old age and death are ultimately extinguished⁷⁷—viewing the twelve factors thus, without any exhaustible characteristic and without giving rise to new views⁷⁸—THAT'S the supreme Dharma-offering.'"⁷⁹

---

## Moon-Canopy Makes His Vow

The Buddha told the Lord of the Gods: "When Prince Moon-Canopy heard this Dharma from the Tathāgata Medicine-King, he got compliant patience.⁸⁰ He right away removed his precious clothes and ornaments, made offerings to the Buddha, and said: 'World-Honored One! After the Tathāgata enters nirvāṇa, I shall practice Dharma-offering and protect the true Dharma. May your awesome power be added to me, enabling me to subdue the māra-enemies and practice the bodhisattva path.'⁸¹

"The Buddha, knowing his deep intention, prophesied: 'In the final age, you shall protect the Dharma-fortress.'⁸²

"Lord of the Gods! At that time, Prince Moon-Canopy, seeing the Dharma as pure and hearing the Buddha's prophecy, left home with faith and cultivated wholesome dharmas.⁸³ Soon after, with diligent effort, he got the five supernatural powers and the bodhisattva path,⁸⁴ got dhāraṇī, and got uninterrupted eloquence.⁸⁵

"After that buddha's death, through his supernatural powers, dhāraṇī, and eloquence, for a full ten small kalpas he circulated the Dharma-wheel that the Tathāgata Medicine-King had turned.⁸⁶

"The monk Moon-Canopy, through protecting the Dharma with diligent practice, in that very body transformed a hundred million billion people, causing them to become irreversible from supreme enlightenment; caused fourteen nayutas to deeply aspire to the śrāvaka and pratyekabuddha paths;⁸⁷ and caused immeasurable beings to be born in the heavens.⁸⁸

---

## Who Was Who

"Lord of the Gods! That King Jewel-Canopy—who was he? He's the buddha now named Jewel-Flame.⁸⁹ His thousand sons are the thousand buddhas of this Fortunate Kalpa—from Krakucchanda Buddha up to the last, the Tathāgata Roca.⁹⁰

"And the monk Moon-Canopy—who was he? I MYSELF am he.⁹¹

"So, Lord of the Gods! You should understand this essential point: Dharma-offering to all offerings is supreme, foremost, unparalleled.⁹² Therefore, Lord of the Gods! Use the Dharma to make offerings to the Buddha."⁹³

## Theological Note

### Dharma-Offering Beats Everything

You could make offerings to countless buddhas filling the whole cosmos, for kalpas on kalpas, with magnificent stūpas and all kinds of treasures—and still, hearing this sūtra, believing it, understanding it, practicing it, TEACHING it—beats all that.

Why? Because all buddhas' enlightenment COMES from this. The Dharma is the source. Material gifts are beautiful, but Dharma-gift is liberation.

### The Four Reliances

Meaning over words. Wisdom over consciousness. Definitive teachings over interpretable ones. Dharma over persons. These are the guidelines for how to learn. Don't get stuck on fancy language—get the meaning. Don't rely on your thinking mind—cultivate wisdom. Don't follow teachers who don't walk the talk—follow the Dharma itself.

### The Buddha's Past Life

Śākyamuni was Moon-Canopy—the prince who first asked about Dharma-offering and then spent ten small kalpas spreading the teaching after that ancient buddha died. The Blues knows about this—you become what you practice.

## The Buddha Gives It to Maitreya

Right then, the Buddha spoke to the Bodhisattva Maitreya:¹ "Maitreya! I'm now entrusting to you the Dharma of supreme enlightenment² that I've gathered over countless millions of kalpas.³ Sūtras like this one—in the final age after I'm gone⁴—you and your kind should use supernatural power to spread them all over this world.⁵ Don't let them get cut off.

"Why? In future ages, there's gonna be good men and women,⁶ and gods, dragons, spirits, gandharvas, and rakṣasas,⁷ who generate the mind of supreme enlightenment and love the great Dharma.⁸ If they don't hear sūtras like this, they'll lose this excellent benefit.⁹

"When such folks hear these sūtras, they'll definitely believe and get real excited, generating a rare aspiration.¹⁰ They should receive them with the crown of their heads.¹¹ According to what benefits beings are ready for, explain broadly for them."¹²

---

## Two Kinds of Bodhisattvas

"Maitreya! You should know: bodhisattvas got two characteristics.¹³ What are the two?

"First: they like elaborate phrases and fancy writing.¹⁴

"Second: they don't fear profound meaning and can really enter it.¹⁵

"Them that like elaborate phrases and fancy writing—know that these are new-learner bodhisattvas.¹⁶ Them that, when it comes to these undefiled, unattached, real deep sūtras,¹⁷ ain't scared, can enter them, and hearing them their minds get pure,¹⁸ accepting, upholding, reading, reciting, practicing what's taught—know that these been practicing the path a long time.¹⁹

---

## What Holds New Folks Back

"Maitreya! There's two more things that keep them called new learners from being able to get into profound Dharma.²⁰ What are the two?

"First: never having heard profound sūtras before, when they hear them they get startled, doubt, and can't follow.²¹ They slander and don't believe, saying: 'I never heard this before—where'd it come from?'²²

"Second: if there's folks who protect, uphold, and explain such profound sūtras, they refuse to approach them, serve them, or respect them.²³ Sometimes they talk bad about them.²⁴

"Having these two things—know that this is a new-learner bodhisattva who's hurting himself²⁵ and can't, in profound Dharma, train his mind."²⁶

---

## What Holds Even Believers Back

"Maitreya! There's two more things: even though a bodhisattva believes and understands profound Dharma, he still hurts himself and can't get the patience of non-arising.²⁷ What are the two?

"First: looking down on new-learner bodhisattvas and not teaching them.²⁸

"Second: even though understanding profound Dharma, still grasping at characteristics and making discriminations.²⁹

"That's the two."³⁰

---

## Maitreya Says He's In

When Maitreya heard this, he said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! Unprecedented! Like you taught, I'll stay away from such evils³¹ and uphold the Dharma of supreme enlightenment that you gathered over countless kalpas.³²

"If in future ages there's good men and women seeking the Mahāyāna,³³ I'll make sure they get these sūtras in their hands.³⁴ I'll give them the power of mindfulness, so they can accept, uphold, read, recite, and explain to others.³⁵

"World-Honored One! If in the final age there's folks who can accept, uphold, read, recite, and explain for others,³⁶ know that they're all established through Maitreya's supernatural power."³⁷

---

## The Buddha Says Right On

The Buddha said: "Excellent! Excellent! Maitreya! What you said—the Buddha rejoices with you."³⁸

---

## All the Bodhisattvas Vow

Right then, all the bodhisattvas joined palms and said to the Buddha: "We also, after you're gone, will widely spread the Dharma of supreme enlightenment throughout the lands of ten directions.³⁹ We'll also guide them that teach the Dharma, helping them get this sūtra."⁴⁰

---

## The Four Kings Vow

Right then, the Four Heavenly Kings⁴¹ said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! Everywhere—cities, villages, towns, mountain forests, wilderness—wherever this sūtra exists, wherever it's read, recited, and explained,⁴² we'll lead our crews there to hear the Dharma. We'll protect them folks, guarding them for a hundred yojanas in every direction,⁴³ not letting anybody who's looking for a chance against them find one."⁴⁴

---

## Passing It to Ānanda

Right then, the Buddha told Ānanda: "Accept and uphold this sūtra and broadly spread it."⁴⁵

Ānanda said: "So be it! I've accepted and upheld its essentials.⁴⁶ World-Honored One! What should this sūtra be called?"⁴⁷

---

## The Name

The Buddha said: "Ānanda! This sūtra is called 'The Teaching of Vimalakirti.'⁴⁸ It's also called 'The Dharma-Gate of Inconceivable Liberation.'⁴⁹ That's how you should accept and uphold it."⁵⁰

---

## The End

When the Buddha finished teaching this sūtra, the elder Vimalakirti, Mañjuśrī, Śāriputra, Ānanda, and all the gods, humans, asuras, and the whole assembly heard what the Buddha taught.⁵¹ Everybody was greatly delighted.⁵²

## Theological Note

### The Handoff

The Buddha's giving this teaching to Maitreya for safekeeping. When times get hard—the Dharma-ending age—Maitreya and all them bodhisattvas gonna make sure folks can still find this sūtra. The Four Heavenly Kings gonna guard anybody who teaches it. Protection is built in.

### Two Kinds of Practitioners

Them that love fancy language—new learners. Them that ain't scared of going deep—old hands. The test ain't what sounds pretty to you—it's whether you can handle what's REAL.

### Four Ways to Hurt Yourself

1. Get scared of deep sūtras and reject them
2. Avoid and criticize teachers who got the goods
3. Look down on beginners instead of helping them
4. Even if you understand, keep grasping and discriminating

All four are self-harm. You're blocking your own path.

### Two Names, One Sūtra

"The Teaching of Vimalakirti"—that's personal, about the man.
"The Dharma-Gate of Inconceivable Liberation"—that's doctrinal, about what it teaches.

Both names are true. The layman spoke it. The liberation is beyond thought.

---

## Blues Finale

We done walked through all fourteen chapters now. From the Buddha Land where Vimalakirti showed that the ground is pure when the mind is pure, through all them bodhisattvas and disciples getting schooled, to Mañjuśrī's visit and the thunderous silence on non-duality, to Akṣobhya's whole world getting brought here like a flower garland—and now the handoff to the future.

This teaching says: Don't be scared of what's deep. Don't run from what's strange. Don't look down on them just starting out. And don't grasp even at your understanding.

The layman knew what the monks had forgot. The silence said more than all the words. And the Dharma-Gate of Inconceivable Liberation stays open.

**Everybody was greatly delighted.**
