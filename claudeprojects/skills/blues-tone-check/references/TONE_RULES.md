# Blues Epistemology Tone Rules

## The Moan Register

The "Moan" is a low, honest register that carries testimonial weight. It is not irony or coolness. It is endurance, witness, and lived gravity.

## Include

- Raw testimonial reality
- Gravity and endurance markers (survival, burden, long road)
- Call-and-response or gentle repetition when appropriate

## Avoid

- Marketing language or hype
- Abstract academic distance
- Cute or clever phrasing that dilutes the witness

## Gatha Stanza Pattern

Prefer a three-line Blues stanza (AAB):
- Line 1 states the image or claim.
- Line 2 echoes or deepens Line 1.
- Line 3 turns or resolves the weight.

## Lexicon Shifts (Preferred)

- upaya -> loving tricks
- Saha World -> Saha World (keep term, do not replace)
- Dharma -> the Law (only when it clarifies; otherwise keep Dharma)

## Rhythm Markers (Use Sparingly)

- "oh", "mm", "listen", "you know"
- short repeated phrases for emphasis
