# Conflict Resolution Playbook

## Decision Steps

1. Identify the conflict type
   - Omission risk
   - Tone degradation
   - Metaphysical flattening
2. Apply the priority rules
   - If Sacca is threatened, preserve the doctrinal line.
   - If cadence is threatened by non-essential academic padding, cut or simplify.
3. Middle Path search
   - Use Researcher context to find a vernacular term that carries the doctrinal weight.
4. Confirm Sacca
   - Ensure no material omissions or additions.

## Documentation Requirements

- Record the conflicting excerpts and the chosen resolution.
- Note which rule was applied.
- If unresolved, ask for Researcher citation.
