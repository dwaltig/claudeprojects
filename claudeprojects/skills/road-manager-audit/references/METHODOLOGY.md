# Road Manager Methodology

Sacca (Truth) means strict material equivalence between source and translation. The audit must prove 1:1 coverage of all source material without compression or expansion.

Principles:
- Every source line is accounted for by a corresponding translation line.
- Omissions are CRITICAL defects.
- Additions that introduce new material are defects (WARNING if interpretive, CRITICAL if substantive).
- Prefer literal, scholarly precision over stylistic flourish.
- If a glossary or style guide exists, it overrides personal preference.
