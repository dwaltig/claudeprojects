## Executive Summary

**These are the CLIMACTIC CHAPTERS** containing the philosophical summit of the entire MMK:
- **Chapter 24**: The Great Equation (pratītyasamutpāda = śūnyatā = madhyamā pratipad)
- **Chapter 25**: The Grand Equation (saṃsāra = nirvāṇa)

Errors here have disproportionate impact on the reader's understanding.

## Chapter 24: Āryasatya-parīkṣā (40 verses) - THE PHILOSOPHICAL CLIMAX

### Critical Verses Assessment

| Verse | Sanskrit Included | Translation | Commentary | Status |
|-------|------------------|-------------|------------|--------|
| 24.1 | ✅ | ✅ Accurate | ✅ Opponent identified | Good |
| 24.7 | ✅ | ✅ Accurate | ✅ Category error noted | Good |
| 24.8 | ✅ | ✅ Accurate | ⚠️ Needs expansion | Revise |
| 24.10 | ✅ | ✅ Accurate | ✅ "Ladder" metaphor | Good |
| 24.11 | ✅ | ✅ Accurate | ✅ Snake analogy explained | Good |
| 24.14 | ✅ | ✅ Accurate | ✅ "Great Turning" noted | Good |
| **24.18** | ✅ | ✅ **CORRECT** | ⚠️ Needs *prajñapti* note | Priority |
| 24.20 | ✅ | ✅ Accurate | ✅ Mirror rebuttal noted | Good |
| 24.40 | ✅ | ✅ Accurate | ✅ Conclusion clear | Good |

### Issues Found

1. **v24.8 (Two Truths)**: Commentary should explicitly distinguish:
   - *Saṃvṛti-satya*: Conventional truth (worldly transactions)
   - *Paramārtha-satya*: Ultimate truth (emptiness)
   - Add: This is not a "higher/lower" hierarchy but two perspectives

2. **v24.18 (The Equation)**: Translation correct but add:
   - *Upādāya prajñapti* = "dependent designation" (critical term)
   - Note: This verse equates four concepts, not three

### Recommended Additions

```markdown
**Verse 24.18 - Commentary Expansion:**
The equation is fourfold:
1. pratītyasamutpāda (dependent origination)
2. śūnyatā (emptiness)
3. upādāya prajñapti (dependent designation)
4. madhyamā pratipad (Middle Way)

These are not merely equivalent but identical in meaning from different angles.
```

## Chapter 25: Nirvāṇa-parīkṣā (24 verses) - THE CULMINATION

### Critical Verses Assessment

| Verse | Sanskrit Included | Translation | Commentary | Status |
|-------|------------------|-------------|------------|--------|
| 25.1 | ✅ | ✅ Accurate | ✅ Objection clear | Good |
| 25.2 | ✅ | ✅ Accurate | ✅ Counter clear | Good |
| 25.3 | ✅ | ✅ Accurate | ⚠️ Via negativa noted | Expand |
| 25.7 | ✅ | ✅ Accurate | ✅ Not nothingness | Good |
| 25.9 | ✅ | ✅ **CRITICAL VERSE** | ✅ Shift explained | Good |
| **25.19** | ✅ | ✅ **CORRECT** | ⚠️ Needs clarification | Priority |
| **25.20** | ✅ | ✅ **CORRECT** | ⚠️ Needs clarification | Priority |
| 25.24 | ✅ | ✅ Accurate | ✅ Silence noted | Good |

### Issues Found

1. **v25.19-20 (The Grand Equation)**: 
   - Translation correct: "no distinction between saṃsāra and nirvāṇa"
   - **Critical clarification needed**: This is *non-difference in emptiness*, not metaphysical identity
   - Add note: "The difference is epistemological (delusion vs. wisdom), not ontological"

2. **v25.3 (Definition of Nirvana)**: 
   - Good use of *via negativa*
   - Add: This is not agnosticism but pointing beyond conceptual categories

### Recommended Additions

```markdown
**Verse 25.19-20 - Doctrinal Note:**
> [!IMPORTANT]
> The equation saṃsāra = nirvāṇa does NOT mean:
> - Suffering is liberation (nihilism)
> - All distinctions are meaningless (moral relativism)
> 
> It DOES mean:
> - Both are empty of inherent nature
> - The difference is in *how they are perceived* (with or without grasping)
> - Liberation is not going somewhere else but seeing clearly where you are
```

## Chapter 26: Dvādaśāṅga-parīkṣā (12 verses)

### Assessment
- **Severity**: 3/10 (Low)
- **Issue**: Some verses summarized rather than fully translated
- **Strength**: Twelve links correctly identified; avidyā as root emphasized

### Recommendations
- Add verse-by-verse translation for completeness
- Cross-reference to Ch 11 (Prior Limits) and Ch 1 (Conditions)

---

## Chapter 27: Dṛṣṭi-parīkṣā (30 verses) - THE FINAL CHAPTER

### Assessment
- **Severity**: 4/10 (Medium)
- **Issue**: 14 unanswered questions not explicitly listed
- **Strength**: "Cessation of all views" theme clear

### Missing Content
The 14 *avyākṛta* (unanswered questions) should be listed:
1. Is the world eternal?
2. Is the world not eternal?
3. Is the world both?
4. Is the world neither?
5-8. Is the world finite/infinite (same fourfold)
9-12. Does the Tathāgata exist after death? (fourfold)
13-14. Is the soul the same as/different from the body?

### Recommendations
- Add explicit list of 14 questions
- Note: These are unanswered because they presuppose *svabhāva*
- v27.30 should cross-reference v24.14 (identical verse)

## Key Terms Requiring Glossary

| Sanskrit | Recommended Translation | Notes |
|----------|------------------------|-------|
| Śūnyatā | Emptiness | Not "void" or "nothingness" |
| Prajñapti | Designation, convention | Key to v24.18 |
| Prapañca | Conceptual proliferation | What ceases in nirvāṇa |
| Dṛṣṭi | View, opinion | What is abandoned in Ch 27 |
| Saṃvṛti | Convention, concealment | Etymology: "covering" |
| Paramārtha | Ultimate meaning | Not "higher truth" |

---

## Overall Assessment

**Translation Quality**: Good (7/10)
- Critical verses 24.18 and 25.19-20 correctly rendered
- Sanskrit source included for key verses

**Doctrinal Clarity**: Needs improvement (6/10)
- Two Truths distinction needs expansion
- Saṃsāra = nirvāṇa requires explicit anti-nihilism note

**Structural Completeness**: Adequate (6/10)
- Chapter 26 summarized
- Chapter 27 missing 14 questions list

**Final Verdict**: Pass with Clarifications Required

These are the keystone chapters. Any misunderstanding here undermines the entire MMK. With the recommended additions, the translation can serve serious scholarly use. As-is, **supplementation with Garfield (1995) or Siderits & Katsura (2013) is essential**.

---

## Auditor's Final Note

> "The Buddha taught the Dharma relying on two truths: conventional and ultimate. Those who do not understand the distinction between these two truths do not understand the profound reality of the Buddha's teaching."
> — MMK 24.8-9

These final chapters are the test of any Madhyamaka translation. The current version passes that test with room for refinement.
