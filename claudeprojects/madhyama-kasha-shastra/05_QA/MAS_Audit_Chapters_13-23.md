## Priority Chapters (Require Immediate Revision)

### Chapter 15: Svabhāva-parīkṣā (6/10)
**Issues**:
- v15.1-2: Commentary conflates *svabhāva* negation with general causation theory
- v15.7: *Kātyāyanāvavāda* reference excellent but needs citation to SN 12.15
- v15.10: *śāśvata/uccheda* dichotomy well-handled
- **Missing**: Explicit definition of *svabhāva* as the *dgag bya* (object of negation)

**Recommendations**:
1. Add: "Svabhāva = that which is uncaused, independent, unchanging"
2. Clarify: Emptiness ≠ non-existence; = absence of inherent existence
3. Cross-reference Ch 24.18 (dependent arising = emptiness = Middle Way)

### Chapter 18: Ātma-parīkṣā (6/10)
**Issues**:
- v18.1: *Pañcadhā mṛgya* (fivefold search) not explicitly labeled
- v18.3: "Trap of Arrogance" excellent but needs Tibetan parallel (*ñams len*)
- v18.6: *Upāya* framing excellent
- v18.9: *Tattvasya lakṣaṇam* well-translated but needs link to prajñā-pāramitā literature

**Recommendations**:
1. Add: Label the fivefold search algorithm explicitly in commentary
2. Add: Cross-reference to Ch 22.1 (same algorithm applied to Tathāgata)
3. Clarify: v18.5 *prapañca → śūnyatā* sequence as the path structure

## Medium Priority Chapters

### Chapter 16: Bandhamokṣa-parīkṣā (4/10)
- Well-structured overall
- v16.9-10: *saṃsāra = nirvāṇa* equation needs more emphasis
- Add: Explanation of why bondage/liberation are empty yet conventionally valid

### Chapter 17: Karmaphala-parīkṣā (5/10)
- v17 is long (33 verses); some verses summarized rather than translated
- *Bīja* (seed) analogy well-handled
- *Vāsanā* needs disambiguation from Yogācāra usage
- Add: Note on how karma works without a permanent self

### Chapter 22: Tathāgata-parīkṣā (4/10)
- v22.1: Fivefold search (*pañcadhā mṛgya*) correctly applied
- v22.16: "Grand Equation" (Tathāgata = Jagat) excellent
- **Missing**: Link to *avyākṛta* (undetermined questions) explicitly

### Chapter 23: Viparyāsa-parīkṣā (5/10)
- Four inversions listed but not systematically analyzed
- **Key correction needed**: The error is not merely cognitive but ontological—the *objects* of inversion are themselves empty
- Cross-reference Garfield p. 276

---

## Low Priority Chapters (Minor Issues)

### Chapter 13: Saṃskāra-parīkṣā (3/10)
- v13.8 "incurable" (*asādhya*) well-translated
- Add: Note that *śūnyatā* as a view is the final obstacle

### Chapter 14: Saṃsarga-parīkṣā (3/10)
- *Anyatva* (otherness) analysis correct
- *Atideśa* (extension) principle at v14.2 should be flagged

### Chapter 19: Kāla-parīkṣā (2/10)
- Cleanest chapter; no significant issues
- Good parallel to Ch 7 noted

### Chapter 20: Sāmagrī-parīkṣā (3/10)
- *Gandharvanagara* (mirage city) simile well-used
- Could add cross-reference to Ch 7 (arising/abiding/ceasing)

### Chapter 21: Saṃbhavavibhava-parīkṣā (3/10)
- Standard deconstruction of arising/passing
- No major issues

## Systemic Recommendations

1. **Key Term Standardization**: Create consistent translations for:
   - *svabhāva* → "intrinsic nature" (not "self-nature" or "essence")
   - *parabhāva* → "extrinsic nature" (not "other-nature")
   - *prapañca* → "conceptual proliferation" (not just "proliferation")

2. **Cross-Reference Network**: Add explicit links between:
   - Ch 15 (svabhāva) ↔ Ch 18 (ātman) ↔ Ch 22 (Tathāgata)
   - Ch 13 (saṃskāra) ↔ Ch 7 (saṃskṛta)
   - Ch 17 (karma) ↔ Ch 8 (karmakāraka)

3. **Two Truths Clarification**: At key verses, note whether the analysis is at:
   - Conventional level (*saṃvṛti-satya*)
   - Ultimate level (*paramārtha-satya*)

## Final Verdict

**Overall Assessment**: The translation demonstrates strong scholarship and competent philological work. The verse-by-verse structure with Sanskrit source is excellent. Priority revisions are needed for Chapters 15 and 18 to prevent misinterpretation of core Mādhyamaka doctrines.

**Status**: Pass with Revisions Required

- Garfield (1995), *The Fundamental Wisdom of the Middle Way*
- Siderits & Katsura (2013), *Nāgārjuna's Middle Way*
