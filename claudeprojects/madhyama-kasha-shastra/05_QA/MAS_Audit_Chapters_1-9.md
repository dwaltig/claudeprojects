# MAS Audit Report: Chapters 1-9
**Auditor**: DeepSeek Reasoner  
**Date**: 2026-01-11  
**Status**: Pass with Structural Concerns

---

## Executive Summary

**Key Finding**: **Chapters 1-2 are exemplary** with full Prasannapadā commentary, extensive footnotes, and rich scholarly apparatus. **From Chapter 3 onward, there is a marked decline** in commentary depth and exegetical support. This inconsistency is the project's greatest structural weakness.

## Exemplary Chapters (Models for the Project)

### Chapter 1: Pratyaya-parīkṣā (2/10)
**Strengths**:
- Full Candrakīrti opening invocation (Maṅgala verses)
- Complete *sambandha/abhidheya/prayojana* explanation
- v1.3: *Catuṣkoṭi* with opponent school identification table
- v1.4: Four pratyayas with Abhidharma sources
- Extensive Prasannapadā citations
- Prasaṅgika vs. Svātantrika methodological note (v3)
- 34 footnotes with cross-references

**Minor Issues**:
- v1.5: Could clarify that *parabhāva* ≠ "other-nature" in ordinary sense but refers to nature-derived-from-other
- Add: Definition of *prasaṅga* method in footnote 14 is excellent

### Chapter 2: Gatagata-parīkṣā (2/10)
**Strengths**:
- 25 verses fully translated
- *Gata/agata/gamyamāna* trilemma crystal clear
- Double-motion argument (v3-6) with "Devadatta" example
- *Anyonyāśraya* (mutual dependence) explicitly identified
- Cross-reference to Ch 10 (Fire/Fuel) noted
- 33 footnotes
- Lalitavistara citation in conclusion

**Minor Issues**:
- v2.18: The identity/difference analysis could add "neither identity nor difference" as the Mādhyamaka position

---

## Chapters Requiring Restoration

### Chapter 7: Saṃskṛta-parīkṣā (6/10) - PRIORITY
**Issue**: Longest chapter (34 verses) has skeletal commentary
**Problem**: *Utpāda/sthiti/bhaṅga* (arising/abiding/ceasing) is philosophically critical
**Missing**:
- Prasannapadā on the three marks (*trilakṣaṇa*)
- Analysis of conditioned vs. unconditioned (*saṃskṛta/asaṃskṛta*)
- Cross-reference to Ch 21 (Arising/Passing)

**Recommendation**: Restore full commentary to match Ch 1-2 standard

### Chapter 5: Dhātu-parīkṣā (5/10)
**Issue**: *Ākāśa* (space) analysis under-explained
**Missing**:
- Prasannapadā on space as *asaṃskṛta* (unconditioned)
- *Lakṣaṇa/lakṣya* (characteristic/characterized) apparatus
- Link to Ch 15 (Svabhāva) for the characteristic argument

### Chapter 9: Pūrva-parīkṣā (5/10)
**Issue**: Prior perceiver argument needs expansion
**Missing**:
- Extended note on *grāhaka-grāhya* dynamic
- Reference to Pudgalavāda (personalist) school
- Link to Ch 18 (Self)

---

## Good Chapters (Minor Polish Needed)

### Chapter 3: Cakṣurādi-parīkṣā (4/10)
- *Darśana/dṛśya/draṣṭṛ* (seeing/seen/seer) well-handled
- Add: Cross-reference to Ch 9 (Prior Perceiver) and Ch 14 (Conjunction)

### Chapter 4: Skandha-parīkṣā (4/10)
- Five aggregates correctly listed
- Could add: Sectarian differences (Sarvāstivāda vs. Sautrāntika on aggregate reality)

### Chapter 6: Rāgarakta-parīkṣā (4/10)
- Simultaneity problem correctly identified
- Add: Cross-reference to Ch 10 (same identity/difference structure)

### Chapter 8: Karmakāraka-parīkṣā (4/10)
- *Kartṛ/karma* relation well-analyzed
- Correctly notes preview of Ch 10
- Add: Expand Prasannapadā on the "fire/fuel" preview

---

## Systemic Recommendations

### 1. Restore Prasannapadā Consistency
Chapters 1-2 set the gold standard:
- Full Sanskrit source text
- Translation of Prasannapadā commentary
- Extensive footnotes (30+ per chapter)
- Cross-references to other chapters

Chapters 3-9 need restoration to this level.

### 2. Cross-Reference Network
Add explicit links:
- Ch 1 (Pratyaya) → Ch 7 (Saṃskṛta) → Ch 21 (Arising)
- Ch 2 (Motion) → Ch 9 (Prior) → Ch 10 (Fire)
- Ch 3 (Senses) → Ch 9 (Prior) → Ch 14 (Conjunction)
- Ch 5 (Elements) → Ch 15 (Svabhāva)
- Ch 8 (Action) → Ch 10 (Fire) → Ch 17 (Karma)

### 3. Doctrinal Guardrails
At key verses, add warnings against:
- Nihilistic misreadings of "does not exist"
- Substantialist readings of "exists conventionally"
- Reifying emptiness as a "thing"

---

## Final Verdict

**Translation Quality**: High (8/10)  
**Doctrinal Fidelity**: Adequate (6/10) - needs clarification notes  
**Structural Integrity**: Inconsistent (5/10) - Ch 1-2 excellent, Ch 3-9 degrading

**Overall Assessment**: The translation begins as an exemplary scholarly work but does not maintain its initial rigor. **Recommendation**: Restore Prasannapadā commentary to Chapters 3-9 to match the Ch 1-2 standard before publication.
