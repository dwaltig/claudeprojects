## Verse 15.1
**na saṃbhavaḥ svabhāvasya yuktaḥ pratyayahetubhiḥ |**
**hetupratyayasaṃbhūtaḥ svabhāvaḥ kṛtako bhavet ||**

**Translation**:
"The arising of intrinsic nature from causes and conditions is not logical.
Intrinsic nature arising from causes and conditions would be something made."

**Commentary**:
*   **Svabhāva** ("Intrinsic Nature"): Defined here as that which is uncaused, independent, and unchanging. It is the *dgag bya* (object of negation) in Madhyamaka.
*   **Kṛtaka** ("Made/Artificial"): If nature depends on ingredients (like a cake depends on flour), it isn't "nature"—it's a product. Products are perishable; Nature is supposed to be eternal.

---

## Verse 15.2
**svabhāvaḥ kṛtako nāma bhaviṣyati punaḥ katham |**
**akṛtrimaḥ svabhāvo hi nirapekṣaḥ paratra ca ||**

**Translation**:
"How, indeed, could intrinsic nature be something called 'made'?
For intrinsic nature is unmade and independent of another."

**Commentary**:
*   **Akṛtrima** ("Unmade/Non-artificial"): Fire's heat is often cited as *svabhāva*. But even heat depends on fuel. Thus, even fire has no *svabhāva* in the ultimate sense.
*   **Nirapekṣa** ("Independent"): Absolute autonomy. Nothing in the conditioned world fits this definition.

## Verse 15.3
**kutaḥ svabhāvasyābhāve parabhāvo bhaviṣyati |**
**svabhāvaḥ parabhāvasya parabhāvo hi kathyate ||**

**Translation**:
"In the absence of intrinsic nature, whence will there be extrinsic nature?
For extrinsic nature is said to be the intrinsic nature of the 'other'."

**Commentary**:
*   **Parabhāva** ("Extrinsic Nature/Other-nature"): Being an "Other" is the *svabhāva* of the Other. If there is no *svabhāva* anywhere, there can be no *parabhāva*. You can't have a "fake" (other-nature) without a "real" (self-nature) to compare it to.

## Verse 15.4
**svabhāvaparabhaāvābhyām ṛte bhāvaḥ kuto bhavet |**
**svabhāve parabhāve vā sati bhāvo hi sidhyati ||**

**Translation**:
"Apart from intrinsic nature and extrinsic nature, where would existence be?
For existence is established when intrinsic nature or extrinsic nature exists."

**Commentary**:
*   **Bhāva** ("Existence/Entity"): Conventional existence is defined as having a nature (either one's own or another's). If both are absent, the category of "Entity" collapses.

---

## Verse 15.5
**bhāvasya ced aprasiddhir abhāvo naiva sidhyati |**
**bhāvasya hy anyathābhāvam abhāvaṃ bruvate janāḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"If existence is not established, non-existence is not established.
For people call the alteration of existence 'non-existence'."

**Commentary**:
*   **Abhāva** ("Non-existence"): Non-existence is just the change or cessation of Existence. If there was never a Thing, there can be no "Non-Thing."
*   **Crucial Distinction**: Emptiness (*śūnyatā*) is NOT Non-existence (*abhāva*). Emptiness is the absence of intrinsic nature. Non-existence is the annihilation of an entity. To confuse them is the root of Nihilism.

---

## Verse 15.6
**svabhāvaṃ parabhāvaṃ ca bhāvaṃ cābhāvam eva ca |**
**ye paśyanti na paśyanti te tattvaṃ buddhaśāsane ||**

**Translation**:
"Those who see intrinsic nature, extrinsic nature, existence, and non-existence—
They do not see the truth in the Teaching of the Buddha."

**Commentary**:
*   **Buddha-śāsane** ("In the Buddha's Teaching"): To posit *svabhāva* is to miss Dependent Origination. To posit *abhāva* is to fall into Nihilism. The Truth (*tattva*) lies elsewhere.

---

## Verse 15.7
**kātyāyanāvavāde cāstīti nāstīti cobhayam |**
**pratiṣiddhaṃ bhagavatā bhāvābhāvavibhāvinā ||**

**Translation**:
"And in the 'Advice to Katyāyana,' both 'it exists' and 'it does not exist'—
Were rejected by the Blessed One, who perceives [the nature of] existence and non-existence."

**Commentary**:
*   **Kātyāyanāvavāda** ("Advice to Katyāyana"): Refers to the *Kaccāyanagotta Sutta* (*Samyutta Nikaya* 12.15). This is the canonical anchor of the Madhyamaka. The Buddha tells Kaccāyana: "The world, for the most part, relies on a polarity: existence and non-existence." He rejects both.

---

## Verse 15.8
**yady astitvaṃ prakṛtyā syān na bhaved asya nāstitā |**
**prakṛter anyathābhāvo na hi jātūpapadyate ||**

**Translation**:
"If existence were by nature, its non-existence would not occur.
For the alteration of nature never logically obtains."

**Commentary**:
*   **Prakṛti** ("Nature"): Synonymous with *svabhāva*. If I exist by nature, I cannot die, because "Death" is the loss of existence. If existence is intrinsic, immortality follows (*śāśvata*).

---

## Verse 15.9
**prakṛtau kasya cāsatyām anyathābhāva ucyate |**
**prakṛtau kasya ca satyām anyathābhāva ucyate ||**

**Translation**:
"If nature does not exist, of what is alteration said?
And if nature exists, of what is alteration said?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Dilemma of Change**: If no nature, nothing changes. If nature exists, it can't change. Therefore, change itself is an illusion (*māyā*).

---

## Verse 15.10
**astīti śāśvatagrāho nāstīty ucchedadarśanam |**
**tasmād astitvanāstitve nāśrīyeta vicakṣaṇaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
" 'It exists' is a grasping at eternalism; 'It does not exist' is a view of annihilation.
Therefore, the wise should not rely on existence or non-existence."

**Commentary**:
*   **Śāśvata/Uccheda** ("Eternalism/Annihilation"): The two extremes (*antau*).
    *   *Asti* ("It is") -> Things have self-nature -> They never change -> Eternalism.
    *   *Nāsti* ("It isn't") -> Things had nature but lost it -> Annihilation.

---

## Verse 15.11
**asti yaddhi svabhāvena na tan nāstīti śāśvatam |**
**nāstīdānīm abhūt pūrvam ity ucchedaḥ prasajyate ||**

**Translation**:
" 'That which exists by intrinsic nature does not not-exist'—that is eternalism.
'It does not exist now, [but] it existed before'—from this, annihilation follows."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Middle Way**: To avoid these extremes, one must understand Dependent Origination (*pratītyasamutpāda*). As stated in Chapter 24.18: "Whatever is dependently co-arisen, that is explained to be emptiness." It is neither existent nor non-existent.
