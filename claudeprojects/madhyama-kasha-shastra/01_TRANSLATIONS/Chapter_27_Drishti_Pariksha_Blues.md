**Title: "The End of the Road"**

(Verse 1)
I looked in the rearview mirror, tryin' to see my face,
(Tryin' to find the startin' line of this human race)
Was I a King in a golden crown? Was I a beggar in the rain?
Or was I just a whisper in a hurricane?

(Verse 3)
If I was the same man then that I am today,
(I’d be a little bitty baby tryin' to sing and play)
But if I was a stranger, someone else entirely,
Then his sins ain't my sins, and I should go free.

(Verse 6)
You can't separate the Dancer from the Dance he does,
(Can't separate the "Is" from the "Was")
If the Soul stands alone, watchin' the body die,
It’s a cold, lonely eagle in an empty sky.

(Verse 8)
I ain't the Body, but I ain't not the Body neither,
(I ain't a True Believer and I ain't a Deceiver)
I’m like the heat in the fire, like the wet in the rain,
Can't have the pleasure without the pain.

(Verse 13)
You ask me if the World has got an End,
(Like a highway stoppin' at the river bend)
But the road keeps goin', round and round the bend,
And every new beginnin' is just another end.

(Verse 19)
"Finite" needs "Infinite" just to make a sound,
(Like the silence needs the noise to be found)
They lean on each other like two old drunks,
Sleepin' in the alley on the wooden bunks.

(Verse 30)
So put down your arguments, put down your pride,
(There ain't no place left for you to hide)
The Man didn't teach us so we could be smart,
He taught us how to heal the broken heart.
He said, "Let go of the Views, let go of the Lies,"
And wipe the dust of ages from your tired eyes.
I bow to the Man who showed the way,
To the glorious light of the breakin' day.
