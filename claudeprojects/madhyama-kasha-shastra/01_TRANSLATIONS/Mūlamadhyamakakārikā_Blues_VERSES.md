# Chapter 1: Looking at What Makes Things Happen

## *When You Search for Where It All Comes From*

That might sound like bad news. But it ain't. It's the best news you ever heard.

*Neither stopping nor starting,
Neither cut off nor going on forever,
Neither all one thing nor all different things,
Neither coming in nor going out—*
*The one who taught how everything leans on everything else,
How all that noise in your head gets quiet,
How there's peace at the end of all this—
That fully awake one, the best who ever spoke,
Him I bow to.*

*Not from itself, not from something else,
Not from both, and not from nothing—
Never, nowhere, no way,
Has anything ever really come into being.*

*The cause, the object, what came right before,
And what had the power to let it happen—
Those are the four conditions.
Ain't no fifth one.*
1. **The Cause** (*hetu*) — Like the seed is to the sprout
2. **The Object** (*ālambana*) — What your mind is reaching toward
3. **What Came Right Before** (*anantara*) — The moment that just passed away
4. **The Dominant One** (*adhipati*) — Whatever had the power to let it happen

*There ain't no solid nature of things
Hiding in those conditions.
And if there ain't no solid nature,
How you gonna have "other-nature"?*

Nāgārjuna shuts that down too:
*Action ain't got conditions,
Action ain't without conditions,
Conditions ain't got action,
Conditions ain't without action.*

*"It arises depending on these"—
So they say these are conditions.
But as long as it ain't arisen yet,
How come they ain't non-conditions?*

Now we get to the heart of it:
*Neither for what don't exist
Nor for what already exists
Does a condition make sense.
If it don't exist, condition of what?
If it already exists, why need a condition?*
This is the Blues truth right here, friends:
Either way, causation falls apart when you look too close.

After all this looking, all this breaking it down, Nāgārjuna wraps it up:
*So the effect don't come from conditions,
And it don't exist without conditions either—
So where would anything come from
That's got conditions in it?*

Now here's where the preaching stops and the living starts.

# Chapter 2: Looking at Coming and Going

## *When You Search for the Walker Walking*

1. **Where you been** (*gata*) — the ground behind you
2. **Where you going** (*agata*) — the ground ahead of you
3. **Where you're at** (*gamyamāna*) — the ground under your feet right now
*Where you been ain't being walked—
You already walked it, it's done.
Where you going ain't being walked—
You ain't got there yet.
And that space you're standing in?
Apart from "been" and "going,"
There ain't no "standing in" to find.*

Now the opponent speaks up. He says:
"Wait a minute. I see my feet moving. I see the activity right here, right now. The walking's happening in the space I'm crossing. Not behind me, not ahead—right here."
Fair enough. Seems solid. But watch what happens when you look closer.

*How can there be walking in the "being-walked"
When double walking don't make sense?*

Let's try it from the other side. Maybe we can save the walker.
*The walker don't walk—
The non-walker don't walk—
And who else is there?*
Think about it:

*Without walking, no walker.
Without walker, no walking.
So where's either one get started?*
They're leaning on each other with nothing holding them up.

*In the walked, you can't start walking—it's done.
In the not-walked, you can't start walking—it ain't begun.
In the being-walked... well, we just showed that falls apart.
So where does walking start?*
Walking ain't got nowhere to start.

"Okay," someone says. "Forget walking. What about standing still?"
Same problem:
*The goer don't stand still—
The non-goer don't stand still—
Who else is there to stand?*

We're almost at the end. One last try:
*Is the walker the same as the walking?
That don't work—you'd be saying the doer IS the deed.
Is the walker different from the walking?
That don't work neither—you'd have walking without a walker.*

After all this looking, after all this digging:
*So the walking, the walker, and where he's going—
All three come up empty when you really look.*
*"Non-going is a term of attraction.
Going is a term of repulsion.
Where there is neither attraction nor repulsion—
That is the path of the noble ones."*

Now here's the Blues truth, friends.
You might just stop running.

# Chapter 3: Looking at Seeing

## *Can the Eye See What It's Doing?*

First, let's name what we're talking about:
1. **Seeing** — the eye and its business
2. **Hearing** — the ear and its business
3. **Smelling** — the nose and its business
4. **Tasting** — the tongue and its business
5. **Touching** — the body and its business
6. **Thinking** — the mind and its business
Fine. Let's look at one of them and see what we find.

*That seeing—does it see itself?
No, it don't.
And if it can't see itself,
How's it gonna see anything else?*

Nāgārjuna says: nice try, but no.
*The fire example don't work.
Whatever you said about walking,
Same thing applies to burning.*
Same with the burner: the burner don't burn, and the non-burner don't burn.

If seeing falls apart, so does the seer:
*What we said about seeing—
Same thing goes for the one who sees.*
*No seer without seeing,
No seeing without seer,
No "thing seen" without both.
Which one you gonna start with?*
They're all leaning on each other, and ain't none of them got legs.

Nāgārjuna responds:
*If there ain't no "seen" and no "seeing,"
Then the consciousness that's supposed to come from them,
And the contact, and the feeling, and the craving—
Where they gonna come from?*
If the foundation is empty, what's built on it is empty too.

*What we said about seeing,
Same thing applies to hearing, smelling,
Tasting, touching, and thinking.
The hearer, the heard—all of it.*
You can run this analysis on any sense:

Now here's where the Blues comes in, friend.
The Buddha said:
*"The eye don't see forms.
The mind don't know things.
This is the highest truth—
And the world don't enter it."*

# Chapter 4: Looking at What You're Made Of

## *The Five Heaps That Ain't Really There*

Buddhist teaching says there's five things that make up your experience:
1. **Form** (*rūpa*) — your body, your senses, the stuff you touch
2. **Feeling** (*vedanā*) — pleasant, unpleasant, neither
3. **Perception** (*saṃjñā*) — recognizing "this is a tree," "that's my friend"
4. **Formations** (*saṃskārā*) — intentions, habits, mental patterns
5. **Consciousness** (*vijñāna*) — the basic awareness behind it all

Nāgārjuna asks a simple question:
*You can't find form apart from its cause.
You can't find the cause apart from form.
So which one is really there?*
Try to find the form without the elements. Can't do it.
Try to find the elements without the form they make. Can't do it.
They're stuck together. Neither one stands on its own.

"Fine," someone says. "Maybe form exists on its own, without needing a cause."
*If form could exist without a cause,
It would be causeless.
But ain't nothing in this world
That got no cause at all.*

Now flip it around:
*If the cause could exist without the form,
It would be a cause of nothing.
But there ain't no cause
That don't cause something.*
No effect, no cause. The title's empty.

*If form already exists, why's it need a cause?
If form don't exist, what's the cause causing?*
Causation slips through the cracks either way.

Now here's where it gets real:
*Whatever we said about form—
Same thing goes for feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness.
Same thing goes for everything.*
Feeling arises from contact—but contact has no substance.
Perception arises with consciousness—but consciousness is empty too.
Formations arise from ignorance—but ignorance has no solid core.
Consciousness arises from formations—which we just said ain't there.

Nāgārjuna says: nice try.
*Any objection you make against emptiness
Is itself empty.
You can't beat emptiness
By pointing at something else that's also empty.*
There ain't nowhere to stand that ain't already been deconstructed.

Now here's the Blues truth, friend.
Nāgārjuna says: look at them. Really look.
As the Buddha said:
*"The emptiness of one thing
Is the emptiness of all things.
Understand one, understand all."*

# Chapter 5: What They Call "Space" (The Elements Blues)

**The Teaching:**
Well, they talk about that ol' empty Space,
Say it's the first thing in this sorry place.
You find your finger pointin' at your own face.
You can't show me the "empty" 'fore the empty appears,
Just a long, quiet howlin' in your ears.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
Now if Space showed up *before* its brand,
You'd have a nowhere, stretchin' 'cross the land.
A thing with no mark, not a single scar,
A stranger to what it even *is*—now that's bizarre.
An unmarked Space is a king with no crown,
Just a dusty old robe draggin' on the ground.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
Ain't a thing walkin' this earth, on or under the ground,
That don't carry some mark, some stain, some sign,
That says what it is in this tangled-up design.
If it's got no mark, it ain't even a ghost—
It's the imaginary friend you forgot to boast.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
On somethin' already marked? That won't do!
On somethin' unmarked? Well, there ain't such a thing.
The mark's got nowhere to roost, nowhere to sing.
It's a key with no lock, a song with no throat,
A river runnin' dry in an old, empty boat.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
They're leanin' on each other, hand in hand.
Can't find the *thing*—well, the mark falls too,
They're dancin' in circles with nothin' to do.
Like two broke gamblers bettin' with air,
Each one pointin' to the other who ain't there.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
Well, that don't make sense—one's already in hand.
Like two strangers passin' on opposite streets.
Not same, not different, not here, not gone,
Space is a riddle that keeps singin' its song.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
Now some folks holler, "It exists! It's real!"
They point to the sky like they're closin' a deal.
It keeps you from findin' the peace that makes whole.
The more you grab at the solid and true,
The further that freedom gets from you.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
It's the cause and the effect, under the sun and the moon.
It's the feelin' you feel, the fire and the wood,
The whole world's understood like this, and it's good.
Elements, aggregates, the whole creation spin,
Empty all the way down, and empty within.
**What It Means:**

You're free in the middle of the whole, beautiful, empty show.


# Chapter 6: Desire and the One Who Wants (The Longing Blues)

**The Teaching:**
If the *man with the empty heart* was here before the *longin'* came...
Well, who would that man be? A ghost with no story, a dry river with no name.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
A want without a wanter just whistles down a vacant street.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
They can't show up together, holdin' hands, sayin' "we begin as one."
Look close: you can't find where one starts and the other one is done.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
Ain't the *same*—the fire ain't the burn.
Ain't *different*—you can't have the burn without the flame.
You try to pin down this misery, give the blues a separate name...
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
You'd have a hurt with nobody home, a thunderclap with no rain.
The one who longs would disappear into the longin' like a match into the flame.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
You'd have a lover and a love that never met, never touched, never held tight.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
A blues man with no blues? That's the lie the mind'll flaunt.
You can't have the designation without the very thing it names—
A "lover" without loving is just a word playin' games.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
Neither same nor different, neither here nor there,
The longin' and the one who longs just hang suspended in the air.
You can't grab hold of either one—they're made of thinner stuff than prayer.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
The wanter and the want are like the dreamer and the dream,
The seer and the seen, the river and the stream.
Neither one exists alone—they lean on each other's seam.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
It's the *rage* and the *confusion*, and the heart that won't mend.
The hater and the hatred, the fool and the foolish mind...
All just empty echoes, leavin' not a trace behind.
You can't clean a mirror with a dusty, dirty rag.
See the emptiness in the feelin', and the one holdin' the bag.
**What It Means:**


# Chapter 7: Born, Stayin', Gone (The Conditioned Blues)

**The Teaching:**
If "comin' into being" was a real thing, by itself,
It'd have to show up in one of three ways:
From what's already here, from what ain't here at all,
Or from what's both here and gone.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
Say it comes from what's *already here*.
Then what's "comin' into being"? It's already arrived!
Ain't no new birth, just the same old tired man.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
You can't get somethin' from nothin', nohow.
Where would it even start from? There's no ground for the seed.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
You mix a lie with a lie, you get a bigger lie.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
"Lastin'"—what we call stayin' a while—
Depends on this phantom "arising."
You can't prolong a shadow.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
You'd need a lastin' of the lastin',
The regress goes on like a blues song that won't end.
**What It Means:**
If duration is a real dharma, it needs its own duration—infinite regress.

**The Teaching:**
Also leans on this same "arising."
If a thing wasn't truly established,
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
Maybe arisin' gives rise to lastin',
Pretendin' each one's more solid than the others.
Ain't none of 'em got a leg to stand on.
**What It Means:**

They say everything "conditioned" has these three stamps:
Born, stayin', gone.
Is never found in the first place,
You got three labels and nothin' to stick 'em on.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
Neither from what *is*, nor from what *ain't*,
Neither from *both* nor from *neither*,
Does anything ever truly come to be,
From anything, belonging to anyone, anywhere.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
You say it comes from what exists? It's already here.
From what don't exist? There's nothin' to come from.
From both? You're stacking contradictions.
From neither? That's just silence pretendin' to be an answer.
Every road you walk down leads back to this crossroads:
"Arising" ain't what you thought it was.
It's not a solid bridge from nowhere to somewhere.
It's just a word we use to point at the flow.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
It's like a magic show—you see the trick, but there ain't no rabbit.
It's like a dream—you walk through walls, but wake up in your bed.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
The show is still playin'. The dream still unfolds.
It's just that the solidity you once believed in
Was never there in the first place.
The weight lifts—not 'cause the world disappeared,
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
Is just a finger pointin' at the moon.
It's a raft to cross the river of confusion.
Don't mistake the map for the territory.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
For one who knows this deep in their bones,
The dust of sorrow don't cling.
The mind becomes clear, undisturbed,
Like still water after the storm.
No "arising" to chase, no "lasting" to hold, no "ceasing" to fear.
Seein' this, the heart finds its rest
Right in the middle of the comin' and goin'.
The Blues is still played, but the player is free.
**What It Means:**

**The Blues Insight:**


# Chapter 8: The Doer and the Doin' (Action Blues)

**The Teaching:**
They call me a player 'cause I play these strings.
They call it playin' 'cause I'm the one who sings.
You can't pull 'em apart, no matter how you try—
Like the whisperin' wind and the moanin' sky.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
If the doin' comes first, before the doer's found,
Without the doin' at his feet…
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
Walkin' with no walker, singin' with no throat,
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
You can't have action standin' free like a tumbleweed.
They lean on each other like two crutches in the rain,
Neither one can walk alone without the other's pain.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
Well, are they the same? The fire ain't the burn.
If the singer and the song are one and the same thing,
Then the bell *is* the ring, and the sting *is* the sting.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
Not both, not neither—can't find no firm ground.
Just the echo of a question that keeps goin' 'round.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
The karmic bill that comes due—
It's the same story, friend, same lonesome tune:
Can't find the harvest without the planter in the room.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
Neither road takes you to solid land.
The feelin' you feel, the experiencer too—
They lean the same way this whole chapter's been true.
The witness ain't separate from what's seen.
This "doer" is nothin' but a heart yearnin' back at the dream.
**What It Means:**

**The Teaching:**
You see *everything* that way—that's the liberation view.
Not just this action, not just this tired hand,
Empty means flexible, means there's nothin' to fear.
The karma keeps rollin', but nobody's trapped,
'Cause the one you thought was *you* was always just adapt.
**What It Means:**

**The Two Truths on the Bandstand:**
**No Soloist, Just the Jam:**
**Karma Without a Karma-Keeper:**

**Translator**: The Professor (Dr. Rajesh Patel)
**Interpreter**: The Bluesman (Master John Kim)
**Status**: Revised (QA Audit Applied)

"Seeing, hearing, and the like; as well as feeling and the like;

## "Nobody Before the Blues"


**(Verse 1)**
They say there’s a Watcher waitin' ‘fore the sun comes up,
(Yeah, some secret soul pourin' coffee in the cup)
Without the hurtin’, baby, you ain't got no name.


**(Verse 2)**
If you sittin' in the dark before you turn the light,
(Tell me, brother, are you blind or is it night?)
You claim you’re the Singer before you sing the song,


**(Verse 3)**
You say you’re the Driver before you bought the car,
(Standin' on the corner, wishin' on a star)
Can’t own the rhythm, Lord, without the beat.

"A separate entity is not established; neither place nor time exists [for it].


**(Verse 4)**
You say you’re the Captain, separate from the ship,
(Standin' on dry land while the vessel takes a dip)
You’re just a lonely shadow with nothin' left to do.

"And if a separate entity were to exist, distinct from seeing and so forth,


**(Verse 5)**
If the Blues can hurt you when you ain't around,
(Like a ghost guitar makin' a lonesome sound)
Then the pain don't need you, baby, to make it real,
It’s just a broken heart that forgot how to feel.

"Someone has something, but no entity belongs to anyone.


**(Verse 6)**
You say "This is my hammer," you say "This is my song,"
(But tell me, Mr. Owner, where do you belong?)
If there ain't no "You," there ain't no "Mine,"
Just empty boxcars rollin' down the line.

"The entity implies neither an external nor an internal existence.


**(Verse 7)**
I checked the front porch, I checked the kitchen floor,
(Looking for the Man who don't live here no more)
He ain't outside knocking, he ain't inside hidin',
Just a rumour of a Ghost that we all abidin'.

"In this very way, the going of all [senses] is refuted.


**(Verse 8)**
You can't have a Walker if the Road is gone,
(Can't have a Singer if there ain't no Song)
If you ain't movin', baby, you ain't standin' still,
Just a imaginary figure on a imaginary hill.

All goings are prevented by the [analysis of] going by means of going."


**(Verse 9)**
I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride,
(Looked in the mirror, but there was no one inside)
I ain't the Walker, Lord, and I ain't the Road,
Just a heavy burden without no heavy load.

"Therefore, seeing and the like, and feeling and the like,
*   **Tasmād** ("Therefore"): Conclusion (*nigamana*).


**(Verse 10-12)**
(There ain't no "Me" that the devil can find)
The seeing happens, baby, but the Seer is gone,

## "Burnin' Without Wood"


**(Verse 1)**
(Like a dog chasin' tails, twistin' in the turns)
Then you got a phantom flame that just ain't there.


**(Verse 2)**
You say your love is eternal, don't need no spark,
(Glowin' like a neon sign deep in the dark)
Just a lonely old door without no latch.


**(Verse 3)**
If you don't need nobody, you don't need to try,
(Sittin' on a mountain, high in the sky)
Is a cold, cold lie in the summer heat.


**(Verse 4)**
You met me at the station, distinct as day and night,
(We shook hands politely, tryin' to be polite)
We can touch forever, but I’m still alone.


**(Verse 5)**
If you can't reach me, baby, you can't make me cry,
(Just a distant thunder in a cloudy sky)
If the fire don't touch, the wood stays green,
The saddest situation that I ever seen.


**(Verse 6)**
You say it’s like a lover walkin' through the door,
(Like a man and a woman on the dance floor)
The Fire eats the Wood, baby, that ain't me and you.


**(Verse 7)**
I can hold your hand, but I can't steal your soul,
(Unless we’re mixin' ashes in the same old bowl)
If we’re truly different, we can never blend,
Just two strangers waitin' for the end.


**(Verse 8)**
(I’m walkin' in circles in my travelin' shoes)
Can't have a shadow without the man,
Can't have the man without the master plan.


**(Verse 9)**
If the Fire needs the Wood to say its name,
(Who was holdin' the match before the flame?)
If the Wood needs the Fire to make it burn,
It’s a broken record that just won't turn.


**(Verse 10)**
A father makes a son, a son makes a dad,
(Best family riddle that I ever had)
If nobody’s first, then nobody’s last,
Just a ghost train movin' way too fast.


**(Verse 11)**
If you ain't got a job, you can't get paid,
(But you need the money for the trade you made)
If you’re already rich, you don't need a dime,
If you’re broke, you’re just wastin' precious time.


**(Verse 12)**
The Fire don't lean on the Wood, no sir,
(And the Wood don't lean on the Fire, that’s clear)
They ain't hooked up, and they ain't apart,
Just a hole in the middle of a achin' heart.


**(Verse 13)**
The flame didn't come from the city lights,
(And it ain't hidin' in the wood on winter nights)
It didn't go away, and it didn't stay,
It just flashed and faded, then it blew away.


**(Verse 14)**
The Wood ain't the Fire, the Fire ain't the Wood,
(You couldn't catch 'em separate if you understood)
The Fire don't own the Wood like a man owns land,
It’s slippin' like water through your open hand.


**(Verse 15)**
(It’s the same old story that the Buddha told)
The Pot ain't the Clay, the Cloth ain't the Thread,
If you look for the Self, you’re talkin' to the dead.


**(Verse 16)**
If you think you’re a Soul in a bag of skin,
(Separate from the world that you livin' in)
You can read all the books on the dusty shelf,

**Interpreter**: The Bluesman (Master John Kim)

## "Ain't No Start Line"


**(Verse 1)**
The Big Boss Man said it, way back in the day,
(Before the blues was born, before we learned to play)
You can search the horizon, look for where it began,


**(Verse 2)**
If you ain't got a beginning, you can't have an end,
(It’s a circle, baby, twistin' round the bend)
It’s just an endless song that the shadows sing.


**(Verse 3)**
If Birth came first, strutting proud and tall,
(Before the winter wind began to call)
You’d be an immortal baby, never growin' old,
A story with a beginning that can never be told.


**(Verse 4)**
If Death came first, waitin' at the gate,
(Before you even born, sealin' up your fate)
Just a grim reaper cuttin' empty air.


**(Verse 5)**
If they walked in together, hand in hand,
(Birth and Death dancin' in the same old band)
You’d be dyin' while you’re cryin' your very first breath,
A cradle made of cypress, smellin' like death.


**(Verse 6)**
You can’t put 'em in order, you can’t make 'em fit,
(The pieces of the puzzle just don't wanna sit)
Tryin' to map a river in a floodin' land.


**(Verse 7)**
It ain't just livin', it’s the cause and the effect,
(Every broken promise that you try to collect)
The feelin' and the feeler, the hammer and the stone,
Ain't nobody started this trouble alone.


**(Verse 8)**
It ain't just the sorrow, it ain't just the pain,
(It’s every drop of water in the pourin' rain)
Nothin' has a birthday, nothin' has a tomb,
Just an endless weavin' on a ghostly loom.

## "The Blame Game"


**(Verse 1)**
(Was it me, was it them, or a demon in the blue?)
Everybody’s guessin' where the trouble began,


**(Verse 2)**
If I built this prison, then I hold the key,
(But I don't remember lockin' up the real me)
If the man I was yesterday is dead and gone,


**(Verse 3)**
If you built this prison, just to watch me cry,
(Like a cruel puppet master in the big blue sky)
Then I’m servin' time for a crime I didn't do,


**(Verse 4)**
If I’m the Sufferer before the pain arrives,
(Livin' in the shadows of a thousand lives)
Just a hollow echo in a burnin' flame.


**(Verse 5)**
If the pain is floatin' free, without a soul to bite,
(Like a rabid dog howlin' in the middle of the night)
It don't belong to me, and it don't belong to you,
Just a phantom misery passin' through.


**(Verse 6)**
(Without a "Me" to stand here, "You" just fade away)
We’re leanin' on each other like a house of cards,
Fallin' down together in the same backyards.


**(Verse 7)**
I can't hurt myself 'cause I ain't solid ground,
(I’m changin' like the weather when the wind comes 'round)
Like the rhythm and the melody in the same old mind.


**(Verse 8)**
It wasn't me alone, and it wasn't just the town,
(It wasn't both together that brought the hammer down)
Two wrongs don't make a right, two ghosts don't make a man,
Tryin' to catch the wind with a broken hand.


**(Verse 9)**
It didn't come from nothin', like a bolt from the blue,
(Sufferin' has a reason, just like me and you)
If it fell out of the sky without a seed to grow,
We’d be cryin' forever with nowhere to go.


**(Verse 10)**
It ain't just the heartache, it’s the tree and the stone,
(Nothin' in this world ever stands alone)
The flower needs the rain, and the rain needs the cloud,
Ain't nobody separate, ain't nobody proud.


# Madhyamakashāstra Chapter 13: Examination of Compounded Phenomena (Saṃskāra-parīkṣā)

**Interpreter**: The Bluesman (Master John Kim)
**Status**: Blues Vernacular Interpretation

## "The Neon Mirage"


**(Verse 1)**
The Good Lord said everything is a beautiful lie,
(Like a neon sign flashin' in a midnight sky)
It looks so solid, it looks so bright and clear,


**(Verse 2)**
(Is it the dreamer or the dream that the devil made?)
It ain't about the swindle, it ain't about the scheme,
It’s just the empty nature of the whole damn scene.


**(Verse 3)**
You know it’s empty 'cause it’s always on the move,
(Like a scratchy record jumpin' out the groove)
If it was what it was, it would never, ever change,


**(Verse 4)**
(Like a frozen statue sittin' on a throne)


**(Verse 5)**
The milk don't turn to whiskey by stayin' the same,
(And it don't turn to whiskey by just changin' its name)
If they were truly different, they’d never, ever meet,
Change is a mystery walkin' down the street.


**(Verse 6)**
The young man ain't dyin' while he’s young and free,
(And the old man’s already what he’s gonna be)
It’s a lonesome lesson that we all gotta learn.


**(Verse 7)**
If you had a "Something," you could have a "Nothin'" too,
(But the "Something" is a phantom that we’re lookin' through)
Emptiness ain't a thing you can put in your hand,
It’s just the shiftin' of the desert sand.


**(Verse 8)**
Emptiness is the medicine for every sick mind,
(The only way to leave all your troubles behind)
Then you’re a dyin' man, baby, and you always will.


# Madhyamakashāstra Chapter 14: Examination of Association (Saṃsarga-parīkṣā)

**Interpreter**: The Bluesman (Master John Kim)
**Status**: Blues Vernacular Interpretation

## "We Ain't Never Met"


**(Verse 1)**
The Seer and the Seen, standin' eye to eye,
(Like two old lovers 'neath a stormy sky)
They try to touch, they try to make a connection,


**(Verse 2)**
The Lover and the Beloved, burnin' with desire,
(Thinkin' they can meet inside the ring of fire)
It’s a lonely lesson that the heart never learns.


**(Verse 3)**
To shake a man’s hand, you gotta be apart,
(Different names, different faces, different heart)
We just slide on by, ridin' separate trains.


**(Verse 4)**
If you ain't got a "Me," you can't have a "You,"
(That’s the hardest logic that a man can chew)
Association is a game for things that are real,


**(Verse 5)**
"Left" needs "Right" just to know its name,
(Without the other side, it’s a losin' game)
If you take away the "Right," the "Left" is gone,
Just a heavy silence where the word belongs.


**(Verse 6)**
If "Different" was real, it would stand alone,
(Like a king on a mountain, sittin' on a throne)
It wouldn't need a neighbor to define its face,


**(Verse 7)**
Difference ain't hidin' in the things you see,
(It ain't in the bird and it ain't in the tree)
If you can't find "Different," you can't find "The Same,"
It’s just empty smoke risin' from the flame.


**(Verse 8)**
(There ain't no glue in the universal mind)
The Meetin', the Met, and the Meeting Place,
Are just clouds dissolvin' in infinite space.


# Madhyamakashāstra Chapter 15: Examination of Intrinsic Nature (Svabhāva-parīkṣā)

**Interpreter**: The Bluesman (Master John Kim)
**Status**: Blues Vernacular Interpretation

## "The Middle Path Blues"


**(Verse 1)**
If you built it in a factory, if you bought it in a store,
(It ain't the real thing, baby, just a plastic chore)
If it comes from a reason, if it comes from a cause,
It ain't got no Nature, it’s just obeyin' laws.


**(Verse 2)**
You talk about your "Nature" like it’s carved in stone,
(Sittin' independent on a golden throne)
Your "Independent Nature" just ain't there.


**(Verse 3)**
If you ain't got a Self, you can't have an Other,
(Can't have a stranger if you ain't got a brother)
"Other" is just "Self" seen from across the street,
Two empty shadows dancin' to the beat.


**(Verse 4)**
If you take away the Self, and take away the Friend,
(Where does the Beginning start, where does the Ending end?)
The world is just a stage with nobody to play,
Just a ghost town waitin' for the break of day.


**(Verse 5)**
If nothin' ever was, then nothin's ever gone,
(You can't lose a battle that was never on)
"Non-existence" is just a word for things that fade,
A shadow of a shadow in the cool, cool shade.


**(Verse 6)**
You look for the Real, you look for the Void,
(But the Truth is a place that you try to avoid)
If you say "It Is," you’re blinded by the light,
If you say "It Ain't," you’re lost in the night.


**(Verse 7)**
Old Man Katyāyana asked the Lord for the news,
(He said, "Lord, tell me how to shake these existential blues")
The Lord said, "Son, don't say It Is, and don't say It Ain't,
That’s the devil’s painting, and that’s the devil’s paint."


**(Verse 8)**
If you were born Eternal, you could never die,
(You’d be a frozen statue in a painted sky)


**(Verse 9)**
(If you’re made of water, how you gonna burn?)
Just a leaf blowin' silence on the ground.


**(Verse 10)**
"It Is" is a trap that holds you in the past,
(Thinkin' that the good times are gonna last)
"It Ain't" is a hole where you fall right through,
Neither one is gonna save you from the blues.


**(Verse 11)**
(Don't look down at the darkness there)
Don't lean to the left, don't lean to the right,
Just keep on walkin' through the middle of the night.


# Madhyamakashāstra Chapter 16: Examination of Bondage and Liberation (Bandhana-mokṣa-parīkṣā)

**Interpreter**: The Bluesman (Master John Kim)
**Status**: Blues Vernacular Interpretation

## "The Jailhouse Blues"


**(Verse 1)**
I been wanderin' round this circle since the day I was born,
(Shoes are tattered and my soul is worn)


**(Verse 2)**
I looked in the mirror, checked the eyes and the skin,
(Looked for the sinner who committed the sin)
A heavy sensation without no load.


**(Verse 3)**
If my soul is eternal, it can't move an inch,
(Like a stone statue on a marble bench)
If my soul is a shadow that fades in the light,


**(Verse 4)**
You say you want Freedom, you want to be free,
(But tell me, brother, who is this "Me"?)
A ghost can't be handcuffed, a ghost can't be chained,


**(Verse 5)**
The shackles don't hold me, the cell ain't real,
(It’s just a spinnin' cog in a phantom wheel)
Things come together and things fall apart,


**(Verse 6)**
If you holdin' on tight, you’re already bound,
(Chasin' your tail like a hungry hound)
If you let it all go, there ain't nothin' to tie,
Just a wide open space in a empty sky.


**(Verse 7)**
Can't lock up a prisoner before he’s a man,
(That ain't the way that the warden planned)
If the prisoner is missin', the jail is a joke,
Just iron bars made of cigarette smoke.


**(Verse 8)**
If you’re tied to the track, you can't walk away,
(And if you’re walkin' away, you ain't tied today)
You can't be a prisoner and a free man too,
That’s a logical riddle that’ll make you blue.


**(Verse 9)**
"I’m gonna get to Heaven, I’m gonna be saved,"
(That’s what it says on the stone on the grave)
Just another heavy sack on the same old road.


**(Verse 10)**
I stopped lookin' for Freedom, stopped runnin' from Pain,
(Stopped tryin' to stay dry in the pourin' rain)
Samsara and Nirvana, they’re the same damn town,
Just depends on if you’re up or if you’re down.


# Madhyamakashāstra Chapter 17: Examination of Action and Fruit (Karma-phala-parīkṣā)

**Interpreter**: The Bluesman (Master John Kim)
**Status**: Blues Vernacular Interpretation (Part 1)

## "The I.O.U. Blues"


**(Verse 1)**
Be kind to your neighbor, keep your mind real cool,
(Don't be actin' crazy, don't be actin' like a fool)
That’s the seed you plantin', deep in the ground,
Gonna grow a sweet apple when the harvest comes round.


**(Verse 2)**
The Prophet said Karma is the will and the deed,
(It’s the thought in your head and the hunger you feed)
There’s a thousand ways to do it, a thousand ways to fall,


**(Verse 6)**
If the deed stays forever, it’s a heavy, heavy stone,
(Like a unwanted guest who won't leave you alone)


**(Verse 7-11)**
You say it’s like a seed turnin' into a sprout,
(A long green line that snakes all about)


**(Verse 13-14)**
(Like a shadow that stays when the day is done)
It’s a I.O.U. note in the bank of the sky,
Says "You owe me, baby" until the day you die.


**(Verse 15)**
You say the action fades but the debt stays true,
(Like a stain on the collar of a shirt written "You")
You tryin' to fix the hole in the bottom of the sack,
With a patch made of dreams that you can't give back.


**(Verse 20)**
If the debt was real, like a rock or a tree,
(It would last forever, through eternity)
You’d never pay it off, you’d never be free,
Just a lifer in the prison of history.


**(Verse 21)**
If the Doer is real, he’s gotta stay the same,
(Can't change his face, can't change his name)
You can't get wet if you ain't in the rain.


**(Verse 22)**
We want the sweet fruit, we run from the sour,
(Chasin' the pleasure, hour after hour)
The hunger and the feast would be the same damn deed.


**(Verse 23)**
It ain't natural, baby, it’s just a masquerade,
(A costume party that the devil made)
If it was Real Nature, it would stand alone,


**(Verse 24-25)**
The Sin ain't in the body, the Sin ain't in the soul,
(It ain't in the part, and it ain't in the whole)
It’s like a City in the Clouds, shinin' in the sun,
You walk towards the gate, and it comes undone.


**(Verse 27)**
We spinnin' a web, but the spider is gone,
(The music is playin', but it ain't no song)
Samsara is a engine runnin' on no gas,
Waitin' for a future that will never pass.


**(Verse 30)**
It’s like a Magic Man puttin' on a show,
(Pullin' rabbits from a hat in a long, dark row)
The Magician makes a Puppet, and the Puppet makes a scene,


**(Verse 31)**
I’m the Puppet, baby, and my Deed is the Act,
(That’s the cold, hard, illusory fact)
I’m a shadow cast by nothin' on a wall of smoke,
Laughin' at the punchline of a cosmic joke.


**(Verse 33)**
The Debt ain't real, but you still gotta pay,
(That’s the riddle of the Blues, what can I say?)
It’s a Dream within a Dream, a Mirage in the sand,


# Madhyamakashāstra Chapter 18: Examination of Self (Ātma-parīkṣā)

**Interpreter**: The Bluesman (Master John Kim)
**Status**: Blues Vernacular Interpretation

## "Nobody's Home"


**(Verse 1)**
If the Soul is the Body, it dies in the grave,
(Ain't no prayer or magic that can save)
If the Soul ain't the Body, floatin' in the air,
It can't feel the hunger, can't feel the despair.


**(Verse 2)**
If there ain't no "Me," there ain't no "Mine,"
(No fence around the yard, no property line)
When the Owner leaves the house, the walls fall down,
Just a pile of bricks in a ghost town.


**(Verse 3)**
If you strut around sayin' "I ain't got no Pride,"
(Keepin' all your holiness locked up inside)
You just built a new ego, shiny and clean,
The biggest hypocrite that the world ever seen.


**(Verse 4)**
When "Me" and "Mine" fade like the settin' sun,
(The long war is over, the battle is done)
The grabbin' hands open, the birth-cord breaks,
No more shiverin' with the cold, cold shakes.


**(Verse 5)**
Freedom comes when the stories stop,
(When the needle jumps off the record shop)
The stories come from thinkin', thinkin' comes from fear,


**(Verse 6)**
The Boss Man told the sinner, "You got a Soul to save,"
He told the rich man, "It all ends in the grave,"
"It ain't Yes or No, baby, it’s just the flow."


**(Verse 7)**
When the thinkin' stops, the talkin' dies,
(Like a bird vanishin' in the empty skies)
Reality don't need no word, don't need no name,
It was here before the candle and here before the flame.


**(Verse 8)**
It’s Real, it Ain't Real, it’s Both, it’s Neither,
(Like a fever dream or a gospel believer)
Whatever gets you through the long dark night,
Whatever turns the darkness into light.


**(Verse 9)**
You can't learn it from a book, can't buy it in a store,
(You gotta walk through the fire to get to the door)
It’s peaceful, it’s quiet, it don't make a sound,
It’s the solid rock in the shiftin' ground.


**(Verse 10)**
It ain't the same river, but it ain't a new stream,
(Just wakin' up slowly from a complicated dream)
We ain't eternal, but we don't disappear,
Just changin' shapes year after year.


**(Verse 12)**
When the preachers are gone and the churches burn down,
(And there ain't no Bible in the whole damn town)
The Loner finds the Truth in the fallin' rain,
Walkin' by himself down the glory lane.


# Madhyamakashāstra Chapter 19: Examination of Time (Kāla-parīkṣā)

**Interpreter**: The Bluesman (Master John Kim)
**Status**: Blues Vernacular Interpretation

## "Killin' Time"


**(Verse 1)**
If Tomorrow is hidin' inside of Today,
(Waitin' for the clock to tick it away)
Then Tomorrow is already Yesterday's news,
Just a recycling bin for the same old blues.


**(Verse 2)**
If Tomorrow ain't connected to the days gone by,
(Float in' loose in the empty sky)
Then you can't get there from where you stand,
It’s a foreign country in a phantom land.


**(Verse 3)**
"Up" ain't "Up" without the "Down,"
(And the "King" ain't King without the "Clown")
You take away the Left, you lose the Right,
You take away the Day, you lose the Night.


**(Verse 4)**
Time is a shadow that needs a wall,
(If the wall falls down, the shadow don't fall)
It needs a "Thing" to measure, a "Thing" to age,


**(Verse 5)**
You can't catch the moment while it’s passin' through,
(It slips through your fingers like the mornin' dew)
Just a tumbleweed rollin' down a lonely hill.


**(Verse 6)**
I looked at my watch, but the face was blank,
(Like a bounced check at the Memory Bank)
If there ain't no "Me" to wither and fade,
Then Time is just a ghost in the shade.


# Madhyamakashāstra Chapter 20: Examination of Combination (Sāmagrī-parīkṣā)

**Interpreter**: The Bluesman (Master John Kim)
**Status**: Blues Vernacular Interpretation

## "The Missing Ingredient"


**(Verse 1)**
If the Seed meets the Fruit, they shakin' hands,
(But two things in one place, the logic don't stand)
If the Seed is the daddy and the Fruit is the son,
They can't be standin' together when the work is done.


**(Verse 2)**
If they stay apart, like strangers in the street,
(Never say hello, never really meet)
It’s like tryin' to mail a letter with no place to go.


**(Verse 5)**
You can't glue 'em together, can't tear 'em apart,
(It’s a broken connection in a hungry heart)
If they touch, they’re the same; if they don't, they’re dead,
Just a circular riddle ringin' in your head.


**(Verse 9)**
If the Fire goes out before the Water boils,
(All your hard work is just wasted toils)
If the Cause is dead and buried in the ground,


**(Verse 11)**
If you lock 'em in a room and throw away the key,
(Sayin' "Make me a baby, make me history")
If they fused together like a lump of clay,
You ain't got no Cause, you ain't got no Day.


**(Verse 16)**
(Why you burnin' candles in the middle of the night?)
If the Song ain't there, in the air or the ink,
You can't pour a glass if there ain't no drink.


**(Verse 19)**
The Daddy needs the Baby to be a Dad,
(The Baby needs the Daddy or it’s mighty sad)
They lean on each other like a house of cards,
Fallin' down together in the same backyards.


**(Verse 24)**
You gather up the wood, you gather up the spark,
(Tryin' to make a fire in the chillin' dark)
You call it a "Combination," say it’s guaranteed,


# Madhyamakashāstra Chapter 21: Examination of Arising and Passing Away (Saṃbhava-vibhava-parīkṣā)

**Interpreter**: The Bluesman (Master John Kim)
**Status**: Blues Vernacular Interpretation

## "Rise and Fall"


**(Verse 1)**
You can't have the Good Times without the Bad,
(Can't lose the money that you never had)
If the Rise and Fall are holdin' hands,
It’s a shaky foundation on shiftin' sands.


**(Verse 2)**
If you try to die before you’re born,
(Like a midnight shadow in the early morn)
You’re puttin' the cart before the mule,
Breakin' every single natural rule.


**(Verse 3)**
(Wearin' one old sock and one new shoe)
The Life and the Death fight for the space,
Like two runners in a single lane race.


**(Verse 4)**
Nothing stays steady, nothing stays still,
(Water runnin' down the side of the hill)
If you think you’re livin' without the decay,
You’re just a fool dreamin' the day away.


**(Verse 6)**
They ain't together and they ain't apart,
(Like a crack runnin' through a broken heart)
Birth and Death are a package deal,
Two sides spinnin' on the same old wheel.


**(Verse 11)**
You say, "I see the baby, then I see the grave,"
(Like a calm ocean before the wave)
He’d be a stone statue that could never play.


**(Verse 13)**
You say, "It’s all over, the lights are out,"
(Livin' in the shadow of a heavy doubt)
You can't see the sunset without the dawn.


**(Verse 17)**
(Or is it just a story, is it just a fib?)
If he’s the same, then he didn't change,
If he’s different, Lord, it’s mighty strange.


**(Verse 21)**
I looked at my soul in the mirror glass,
(Watchin' the seasons come and pass)
I ain't born, and I ain't dead,
Just a ghostly song in a worryin' head.


# Madhyamakashāstra Chapter 22: Examination of the Tathāgata (Tathāgata-parīkṣā)

**Interpreter**: The Bluesman (Master John Kim)
**Status**: Blues Vernacular Interpretation

## "The Man Who Wasn't There"


**(Verse 1)**
I looked for the Buddha in the temple hall,
(Looked for his shadow on the painted wall)
He wasn't the paint, and he wasn't the stone,


**(Verse 2)**
If he’s made of parts, like a old V-8,
(Runnin' on karma and runnin' on fate)
Then he ain't got a soul that stands alone,
Just a engine rattlin' in the danger zone.


**(Verse 3)**
You can't have the Man without the Parts,
(You can't have the Love without the Hearts)
If you strip 'em away, sayin' "Show me the King,"
You ain't gonna find a solitary thing.


**(Verse 4)**
If he was Real before the body was born,
(Waitin' in the sky like a harvest corn)


**(Verse 11)**
Don't call him "Empty," don't call him "Full,"
(That’s just the wool that the preachers pull)
"Empty" is a word for a jar that’s dry,
"Full" is a word for a cloudy sky.
It’s just a signpost pointin' down the road,
Help you carry the heavy, heavy load.


**(Verse 12)**
(Is he in the ground or in the sky?)
You askin' questions that don't make sense,
Like askin' a cloud for fifty cents.
That’s a secret that the ashes know.


**(Verse 13)**
If you think he’s solid, like a piece of wood,
(You misunderstood, yeah, you misunderstood)
You tryin' to catch smoke in a butterfly net,
Gonna wake up soakin' in a cold, cold sweat.


**(Verse 15)**
You paintin' pictures of a man so grand,
(With a lotus flower in his open hand)
You miss the silence where it all began.


**(Verse 16)**
You wanna know the Buddha? Look at yourself,
(Don't look at the statue on the dusty shelf)
The Empty Nature that makes him Free,
Is the same Empty Nature in you and me.
We’re all just shadows in the same old play,
Dancin' in the light of the breakin' day.


# Madhyamakashāstra Chapter 23: Examination of Perversions (Viparyāsa-parīkṣā)

**Interpreter**: The Bluesman (Master John Kim)
**Status**: Blues Vernacular Interpretation

## "Lookin' Through a Broken Glass"


**(Verse 1)**
I fell in love with a picture in a magazine,
(Prettiest little thing that I ever seen)
It came from the hunger in my own ribcage.


**(Verse 2)**
You say it’s Beautiful, I say it’s Bad,
(The worst mistake that I ever had)
If the Beauty was real, like a diamond ring,
It wouldn't change into a ugly thing.


**(Verse 6)**
Everything you see, everything you touch,
(It don't amount to nothin' much)
It’s a Ghost City floatin' in the desert air,
You pack your bags, but nobody’s there.


**(Verse 7)**
(It’s just a trick of the light on the silver screen)
You scrub and you scrub 'til your fingers bleed,


**(Verse 8)**
You need the Ugly to know the Good,
(Like you need the rot to know the wood)
They lean on each other like two drunk friends,
Stumblin' down the road where the sidewalk ends.


**(Verse 10)**
(Like a melted snowflake in the winter snow)
Just a bad dream waitin' for the break of day.


**(Verse 13)**
The Grabber and the Grabbed and the Grabbin' Hand,
(They all sink together in the quicksand)
When the struggle is over, and the fight is done,
You find out the battle was never begun.


**(Verse 14)**
(Watchin' the distorted shadows pass)
If there ain't no "Who," then there ain't no "Wrong,"
Just a skipped beat in a perfect song.


**(Verse 21)**
Turn off the projector, and the movie dies,
(Wipe the illusion from your tired eyes)
When the lie is gone, the truth breaks through,


**(Verse 25)**
The Lust and the Hate and the Ignorance too,
(They ain't in the sky and they ain't in you)
They’re just bad weather passin' overhead,
Listen to what the Good Lord said.


# Madhyamakashāstra Chapter 24: Examination of the Noble Truths (Ārya-satya-parīkṣā)

**Interpreter**: The Bluesman (Master John Kim)
**Status**: Blues Vernacular Interpretation (Part 1)

## "The Baby and the Bathwater"


**(Verse 1)**
You say if everything is empty, there ain't no hill to climb,
(No reason for the rhythm and no reason for the rhyme)
If the world is just a shadow, you say the Truth is gone,


**(Verse 6)**
You say I’m a Nihilist, a man who don't believe,
(Tryin' to sell a hollow dream, hidin' up my sleeve)
You say I’m trashin' the Church and trashin' the Light,
Leavin' everybody stranded in the middle of the night.


**(Verse 7)**
(You ain't heard the melody, you just heard the gong)
You think Emptiness means "Nothin's Really There,"
Like a man chasin' phantoms in the cold winter air.


**(Verse 8)**
The Boss Man told the story in two different ways,
(To help us navigate through these hazy days)
There’s the Way of the World, where we pay our dues,


**(Verse 10)**
You can't get to the Top without the bottom stair,
(You can't get to the Heaven without the daily prayer)
Emptiness don't mean you stop doin' what’s right,
It’s the only thing that makes the candle burn so bright.


**(Verse 11)**
(One wrong move is the last one you’re gonna make)
If you grab it by the tail, thinkin' "Nothin' is Real,"
It’s gonna bite you in the heart, baby, that’s the deal.


**(Verse 14)**
If you understand Emptiness, the whole world is yours,
(The windows are open and so are the doors)
Just a frozen actor on a static stage.


**(Verse 15)**
You’re lookin' for the horse that you already ride,
(Searchin' the world for what’s already inside)
You say my logic is bad, you say my vision is blurred,


**(Verse 18)**
Dependency is Emptiness, that’s the song I sing,
(Like the vibration hidin' in a guitar string)
It’s the Middle Way, baby, not too loose or too tight,
Just walkin' in the balance, walkin' in the light.


**(Verse 20)**
If things were Solid, you could never change,
(Everything would be permanent and mighty strange)
You’d be stuck in your sorrow, stuck in your pain,
With no hope of sunshine after the rain.
I’m just showin' you the water flowin' in the stream.


**(Verse 21)**
If your Pain was a mountain, made of solid rock,
(It wouldn't matter how loud you’d cry or knock)
It would stay there forever, a permanent scar,
Like a unreach able light from a distant star.


**(Verse 31)**
If the Freedom you’re seekin' was already done,
(Shinin' forever like a static sun)
You could never reach it, you could never find,
Just a treasure locked away in a frozen mind.


**(Verse 36)**
You think you’re defendin' the Truth and the Way,
(But you’re killin' the world with what you say)
If things don't depend on each other to be,
Then there ain't no river and there ain't no sea.


**(Verse 38)**
Action would be empty, effort would be dead,
(Just a bunch of useless noise in your head)
If you were born a sinner, a sinner you’d stay,
With no hope of washin' the stains away.


**(Verse 40)**
(The knot in the middle where the Truth is hid)
You see the Heart of the Buddha, shinin' so true,
In the middle of the sorrow and the middle of you.
You see the Pain, and you see the Cure,
In the Empty Nature, shinin' so pure.

## "Same Old Town"


**(Verse 1)**
You packin' your bags for the Promised Land,
(Lookin' for a place where the mountains stand)
You say, "I gotta leave this world of pain,"
Tryin' to outrun the fallin' rain.


**(Verse 3)**
(It ain't in the sky, and it ain't in the blue)
It ain't something you get, it ain't something you lose,
It’s just the quiet that comes after the blues.


**(Verse 4)**
If Heaven was a Thing, it would rot and rust,
(Turning all your diamonds back into dust)
If it was Real like a rock or a stone,
You’d still be sittin' on a dyin' throne.


**(Verse 7)**
(You can't walk through a non-existent door)
That’s a secret that only the ashes know.


**(Verse 9)**
Samsara is a wheel spinnin' round and round,
(Grindin' your bones into the hard, cold ground)
The spinnin' stops, and the wound can heal.


**(Verse 19)**
I looked at the Devil, and I looked at the Lord,
(One had a smile, and one had a sword)
They were the same face, performing the same task.


**(Verse 20)**
The Jailhouse and the Garden are the same damn place,
(Just depends on the look on your face)
There ain't no fence between the Here and the There,
Just a imaginary line in the empty air.


**(Verse 24)**
I stopped talkin' 'cause there ain't nothin' to say,
(The words just get in the glorious way)
The Buddha never preached, he never said a word,
Just the sound of the wind and the call of a bird.
Peace is the silence when the noise is done,
Two shadows mergin' in the settin' sun.

## "The Domino Effect"


**(Verse 1)**
Ignorance is the Warden, he holds the only key,
(Keepin' you locked up in this ancient misery)
He tells you "Build a Future," he tells you "Make a Plan,"
That’s how you build the prison for the soul of a man.


**(Verse 2)**
The Mind jumps in the Cradle, lookin' for a home,
(Afraid to walk the darkness all alone)
It finds a brand new body, a brand new name,


**(Verse 3)**
Then the Eyes open up, and the Ears start to hear,
(The world comes rushin' in, loud and clear)
The Senses touch the Fire, the Senses touch the Ice,
Rollin' the bones on the devil’s dice.


**(Verse 5)**
It feels so good, you want it to stay,
(It feels so bad, you want it away)
That’s the Thirst, baby, the dryin' of the bone,
Craving for a water that you’ve never known.


**(Verse 6)**
You grab it with your hands, you grab it with your soul,
(Tryin' to fill the bottom of a bottomless hole)
The Grabbin' makes the Becomin', the Becomin' makes the Birth,


**(Verse 7)**
Then comes the Grey Hair, then comes the Pain,
(Tears fallin' down like the monsoon rain)
The coffin and the graveyard, the sorrow and the grief,
Just a tragic ending to a story brief.


**(Verse 9)**
(If you turn on the light, the shadows flee)
Wisdom is the hammer that breaks the heavy chain,
Stoppin' the wheel in the driving rain.


**(Verse 10)**
One by one, the dominoes stop their fall,
(No more writin' on the prison wall)
No more Birth, no more Dyin' Breath,
Just a silence sweeter than the face of Death.
The Mass of Sorrow crumbles into dust,
In the empty wind of the perfect trust.

## "The End of the Road"


**(Verse 1)**
I looked in the rearview mirror, tryin' to see my face,
(Tryin' to find the startin' line of this human race)


**(Verse 3)**
If I was the same man then that I am today,
(I’d be a little bitty baby tryin' to sing and play)
Then his sins ain't my sins, and I should go free.


**(Verse 6)**
You can't separate the Dancer from the Dance he does,
(Can't separate the "Is" from the "Was")
If the Soul stands alone, watchin' the body die,
It’s a cold, lonely eagle in an empty sky.


**(Verse 8)**
I ain't the Body, but I ain't not the Body neither,
(I ain't a True Believer and I ain't a Deceiver)
I’m like the heat in the fire, like the wet in the rain,
Can't have the pleasure without the pain.


**(Verse 13)**
You ask me if the World has got an End,
(Like a highway stoppin' at the river bend)


**(Verse 19)**
"Finite" needs "Infinite" just to make a sound,
(Like the silence needs the noise to be found)
They lean on each other like two old drunks,
Sleepin' in the alley on the wooden bunks.


**(Verse 30)**
(There ain't no place left for you to hide)
The Man didn't teach us so we could be smart,
He taught us how to heal the broken heart.
He said, "Let go of the Views, let go of the Lies,"
I bow to the Man who showed the way,
To the glorious light of the breakin' day.
