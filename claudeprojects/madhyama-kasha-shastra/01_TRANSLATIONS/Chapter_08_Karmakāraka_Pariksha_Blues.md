# Chapter 8: The Doer and the Doin' (Action Blues)

## The Trouble

Well now, sit down right here. Got a question that's been doggin' me since I first picked up this old guitar. See, folks talk about the *singer* and the *song*. The *player* and the *playin'*. They say, "That man *is* the blues." 

But when the last note fades… where'd he go? You start lookin' for the "doer" apart from the "doin'," you find nothin' but an empty stage and a hollow-body echo. That's the trouble. We're all singin' the "I" song, but the melody's got no stand-alone singer.

---

## Verse 8.1: Definitions

**The Teaching:**
They call me a player 'cause I play these strings.
They call it playin' 'cause I'm the one who sings.
You can't pull 'em apart, no matter how you try—
Like the whisperin' wind and the moanin' sky.

**What It Means:**
Agent is defined by action; action is defined by agent. Each needs the other for its very meaning. Conventional definitions work—but can we find them independently?

---

## Verse 8.2: Doer First?

**The Teaching:**
If the doin' comes first, before the doer's found,
Then who's that doin'? On what ground?
But if the doer stands alone, complete,
Without the doin' at his feet…
Then what's he *doin'* in this heat?

**What It Means:**
If the agent exists before acting—it's "agentless" in that moment. What makes it an agent if it's not doing anything?

---

## Verse 8.3: Action First?

**The Teaching:**
Now flip it 'round—the action came before?
Well, who was runnin' when there wasn't no one at the door?
Walkin' with no walker, singin' with no throat,
That's just a ghost hummin' a busted note.

**What It Means:**
Action without an agent is incoherent. "Walking" needs a walker. "Playing" needs a player.

---

## Verses 8.4-8.5: Can't Stand Alone

**The Teaching:**
You can't have action standin' free like a tumbleweed.
And the doer without doin'? That's just a man in need.
They lean on each other like two crutches in the rain,
Neither one can walk alone without the other's pain.

**What It Means:**
Neither agent nor action can exist independently. They require each other for their very identity. Mutual dependence is the only structure that works.

---

## Verses 8.6-8.7: Same or Different?

**The Teaching:**
Well, are they the same? The fire ain't the burn.
Are they different? Then how do they take turns?
If the singer and the song are one and the same thing,
Then the bell *is* the ring, and the sting *is* the sting.
But if they're strangers to each other, passin' on the way,
How does the do-er meet the deed on any given day?

**What It Means:**
Identity collapses the distinction—there'd be no difference between doer and deed. Difference severs the connection—they'd be utterly unrelated. Both options fail.

---

## Verse 8.8: Neither Works

**The Teaching:**
So it ain't through "same" that they get along,
And it ain't through "different" neither, my song.
Not both, not neither—can't find no firm ground.
Just the echo of a question that keeps goin' 'round.

**What It Means:**
The tetralemma applied. Neither identity, nor difference, nor both, nor neither establishes a fixed relationship. What remains is dependence, not substance.

---

## Verse 8.9: The Whole Chain

**The Teaching:**
And if you ask about the *fruit* of what we do—
The karmic bill that comes due—
It's the same story, friend, same lonesome tune:
Can't find the harvest without the planter in the room.

**What It Means:**
Cause and effect—agent, action, fruit—are all caught in the same web of mutual dependence.

---

## Verses 8.10-8.11: Time Won't Help

**The Teaching:**
You say "first comes the cause, then the effect"?
Or "they show up together, intersect"?
Neither road takes you to solid land.
Time don't make nothin' permanent, understand?

The feelin' you feel, the experiencer too—
They lean the same way this whole chapter's been true.
The witness ain't separate from what's seen.
This "doer" is nothin' but a heart yearnin' back at the dream.

**What It Means:**
Temporal sequence doesn't save inherent existence. Even the experiencer (witness) of actions is dependently arisen.

---

## Verse 8.12: The Universal Truth

**The Teaching:**
So when you see the doer and the deed are hollow through,
You see *everything* that way—that's the liberation view.
Not just this action, not just this tired hand,
But the whole world's foundation is built on empty sand.

And that ain't bad news—no, listen here—
Empty means flexible, means there's nothin' to fear.
The karma keeps rollin', but nobody's trapped,
'Cause the one you thought was *you* was always just adapt.

**What It Means:**
The emptiness of agent and action extends to all phenomena. This doesn't destroy moral responsibility—it frees it from reification. Karma works *because* things are empty, not despite it.

---

## The Liberation

So here's the turnaround, the break in the clouds. You see the doer and the doin' ain't solid—they're just *dependently arisen*. Like the sound and the strummin'. You can't find the singer, but the song sure gets sung. 

That's the freedom. You stop grabbin' at ghosts. You stop claimin' a "me" that owns the joy and the pain. You just let the music move through—the cryin', the laughin', the playin'. You become the empty space where the blues can happen. No owner. No permanent performer. Just the raw, dependently-arisen, empty *performance*. 

And in that, there's a peace deeper than the deepest 12-bar groove.

## Theological Notes

| Term | Sanskrit | The Blues Reading |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **Kāraka** | कारक | The doer, the agent—the guitarist, the singer, the one holdin' the harp. |
| **Karma** | कर्म | The deed, the action—the playin', the singin', the cryin' out loud. |
| **Kārya** | कार्य | The effect, the fruit—the impact the song has, the karma that comes due. |
| **Saṃsāra** | संसार | The endless loop—the juke joint of rebirth, the same old song on repeat. |

**The Two Truths on the Bandstand:**
On the *conventional* stage, yeah, there's a singer and a song. We use the words. We point the finger. But under the *ultimate* spotlight, you can't isolate nothin'. The agent is empty of inherent existence (*śūnya*). So is the action. They lean on each other like two drunks holdin' each other up, pretendin' to be a solid wall.

**No Soloist, Just the Jam:**
This ain't nihilism. The music *happens*. Causation *happens*. But it's a web, not a line. It's the whole band—the intention (the itch to play), the instrument (the six-string), the effort (the fingers), the contact (the string meetin' the fret)—all comin' together to make this momentary chord called "action." No single part of it is the "boss." No solid "I" in the center.

**Karma Without a Karma-Keeper:**
The deeds are done. The consequences roll on. But there ain't no little soul inside shuttlin' from life to life like a train on a track. It's just the momentum of the pattern, the habit-energy of the melody, carryin' on dependently. The liberation is seein' through the illusion of the soloist, which cuts the root of sufferin'—the clingin' to "I did that" or "That happened to *me*." You just play the changes as they come.
