# Chapter 1: Looking at What Makes Things Happen
## *When You Search for Where It All Comes From*

### Blues Vernacular Translation by Master John Kim

## Opening: Bowing to the One Who Saw It Clear

*Before we begin, let me pay respect to the man who showed the way—Nāgārjuna, the teacher who didn't sell us nothing, just showed us what ain't real so we could finally be free.*

---

Now, friends, I've been studying what the Professor laid down, and I'm here to tell you—this first chapter of the Middle Way is about one thing: **looking real hard at cause and effect, and finding out there ain't nothing solid there.**

That might sound like bad news. But it ain't. It's the best news you ever heard.

## Part One: The Eight Ways Things Ain't What You Think

> *Neither stopping nor starting,  
> Neither cut off nor going on forever,  
> Neither all one thing nor all different things,  
> Neither coming in nor going out—*
>
> *The one who taught how everything leans on everything else,  
> How all that noise in your head gets quiet,  
> How there's peace at the end of all this—  
> That fully awake one, the best who ever spoke,  
> Him I bow to.*¹

That's the dedication, friends. Nāgārjuna's bowing to the Buddha, and he's telling us right from the start what this whole teaching is about: **dependent origination**—everything leaning on everything else, nothing standing on its own two feet.

And when you really see that? All that mental chatter, all that *prapañca*—it **quiets down**. That's what *śivam* means—"the auspicious," "the peaceful."

## Part Two: The Four-Corner Knockout

> *Not from itself, not from something else,  
> Not from both, and not from nothing—  
> Never, nowhere, no way,  
> Has anything ever really come into being.*²

Now here's where the Bluesman's gotta be honest with you. This verse right here? It's the whole teaching in four lines. Four ways folks think things get made—and Nāgārjuna knocks 'em all down:

| What They Say | What It Means | Why It Don't Work |
|:--------------|:--------------|:------------------|
| **From itself** | "Already had it in me" | Then why you still struggling? |
| **From something else** | "Something outside made me" | But where's that thing's nature? |
| **From both** | "It's complicated" | Two wrongs don't make a right |
| **From nothing** | "It just happened" | Then anything could happen anytime |

See, the Sāṃkhya folks—they say everything was already there in the cause, just hidden. Like the butter was always in the milk. But if it's already there, friend, **why you churning?** What's the point of the work if the job's already done?

And the folks who say "something else made it"—well, we'll get to them. That's what this whole chapter's about.

## Part Three: The Four Conditions (What the Buddha Taught)

Now, here's where it gets tricky. The Buddha *did* teach about conditions. He said there are four kinds:

> *The cause, the object, what came right before,  
> And what had the power to let it happen—  
> Those are the four conditions.  
> Ain't no fifth one.*³

1. **The Cause** (*hetu*) — Like the seed is to the sprout
2. **The Object** (*ālambana*) — What your mind is reaching toward
3. **What Came Right Before** (*anantara*) — The moment that just passed away
4. **The Dominant One** (*adhipati*) — Whatever had the power to let it happen

And Nāgārjuna says: **Ain't no fifth one.** God, fate, destiny, luck—whatever you want to call it—ain't on the list.⁴

---

## Part Four: But Wait—Where's the Nature?

Here's where the Blues comes in. Because after laying out what the Buddha taught, Nāgārjuna looks *into* those conditions and asks the hard question:

> *There ain't no solid nature of things  
> Hiding in those conditions.  
> And if there ain't no solid nature,  
> How you gonna have "other-nature"?*⁵

See, the folks who say "things come from other things"—they need two solid things to make that work. The cause gotta be *really there*, and the effect gotta be *really there*, and they gotta be *really different* from each other.

But here's the trouble: **the seed and the sprout are never there at the same time.** When you got the seed, ain't no sprout. When you got the sprout, the seed done gone. So where's this "otherness" supposed to live?

It's like saying "east" without "west." You can't have one without the other. And if one ain't there yet, you ain't got neither.

---

## Part Five: The Action Problem

Some folks try to get clever. They say: "Okay, maybe the conditions don't *directly* make the effect. Maybe there's an *action* in between—like cooking makes the rice."

Nāgārjuna shuts that down too:

> *Action ain't got conditions,  
> Action ain't without conditions,  
> Conditions ain't got action,  
> Conditions ain't without action.*⁶

Four ways to try it, four ways to fail. The action can't hook up with the conditions no matter how you slice it.

---

## Part Six: The Timing Problem

Here's another one that'll twist your mind:

> *"It arises depending on these"—  
> So they say these are conditions.  
> But as long as it ain't arisen yet,  
> How come they ain't non-conditions?*⁷

A condition is only a condition *of something*. But if that something ain't there yet, what's it a condition *of*? It's like calling someone a father before the child is born. The relation don't exist yet.

---

## Part Seven: The Big Dilemma

Now we get to the heart of it:

> *Neither for what don't exist  
> Nor for what already exists  
> Does a condition make sense.  
> If it don't exist, condition of what?  
> If it already exists, why need a condition?*⁸

This is the Blues truth right here, friends:

- **If the effect don't exist yet**, how can you cause it? You can't push on nothing.
- **If the effect already exists**, what are you causing? The work's already done.

Either way, causation falls apart when you look too close.

---

## Part Eight: The Conclusion

After all this looking, all this breaking it down, Nāgārjuna wraps it up:

> *So the effect don't come from conditions,  
> And it don't exist without conditions either—  
> So where would anything come from  
> That's got conditions in it?*⁹

The effect ain't *in* the conditions. But it ain't *outside* them either. It's not that causation don't work—we see things happening all day long. But when you look for the solid, standalone, self-existing **nature** of cause and effect... **ain't nothing there.**

---

## What This Means for Your Life

Now here's where the preaching stops and the living starts.

You've been carrying around a whole lot of ideas about what caused your trouble. Maybe you blame yourself—"I made this mess." Maybe you blame somebody else—"They did this to me." Maybe you blame both, or you threw up your hands and said "It just happened."

All four of those are **ideas**. And when you look for the solid reality behind them—when you really dig in and ask "What is this self that made the mess? What is this other that hurt me?"—you find... **the same emptiness Nāgārjuna found.**

And that ain't nihilism.¹⁰ That's **freedom**.

Because if your trouble wasn't made by a solid self, you ain't anchored to it. If it wasn't made by a solid other, you ain't trapped by them. The whole chain of "who done what to who" starts to loosen up.

That's the first step off the wheel.

## Endnotes

¹ **"All that noise in your head"**: This is *prapañca* in Sanskrit—the proliferation of concepts, arguments, distinctions that keep the mind spinning. When you see emptiness, the noise dies down.

² **"Never, nowhere, no way"**: Nāgārjuna uses three indefinite pronouns (*jātu*, *kvacana*, *kecana*) to emphasize the absolute universality of this negation. He means it: *nothing* has *ever* arisen with inherent nature.

³ **"Ain't no fifth one"**: This explicitly excludes God (*īśvara*), cosmic will, or any supernatural cause. The Buddha's teaching is naturalistic—things arise from conditions, not from divine fiat.

⁴ **"God ain't on the list"**: Candrakīrti is very clear about this. The Nyāya school tried to add a divine creator as a necessary condition. Buddhism says: nope.

⁵ **"Other-nature"**: This is the key move. "Arising from other" (*parataḥ*) requires two really existing things in relation. But cause and effect are never present at the same moment. So "otherness" can't be established.

⁶ **"Four ways to fail"**: This is another *catuṣkoṭi* (tetralemma). Mādhyamaka loves these—showing that all four logical possibilities lead to contradiction.

⁷ **"Calling someone a father before the child is born"**: Relations require both relata to exist. If the effect doesn't exist yet, the relation "condition-of" can't hold.

⁸ **"You can't push on nothing"**: The non-existent can't be affected. And the already-existent doesn't need affecting. Causation slips through the cracks.

⁹ **"Ain't nothing there"**: This isn't saying things don't happen. It's saying they don't happen with *svabhāva*—with inherent, standalone existence. They happen *dependently*, *relatively*, *conventionally*.

¹⁰ **"That ain't nihilism"**: The whole point of Mādhyamaka is to walk the middle way between eternalism (things have fixed natures) and nihilism (nothing matters). Emptiness isn't "nothing exists"—it's "nothing exists *the way you think it does*."

### Theological Notes

**For those who want the deep doctrine:**

This chapter establishes that **dependent origination** (*pratītyasamutpāda*) and **emptiness** (*śūnyatā*) are two words for the same truth. Things arise dependently—that's the conventional truth. When you look for their inherent nature—that's when you find emptiness.

The four conditions are not rejected—they function perfectly well on the conventional level. What's rejected is the idea that they have **inherent causal power** (*svabhāva*). The seed doesn't contain some essence-of-sprout that it passes along. The relationship is **empty of inherent nature** but **full of functional dependency**.

This is the foundation for everything that follows in the Middle Way. If you understand this chapter, you understand the whole teaching.
