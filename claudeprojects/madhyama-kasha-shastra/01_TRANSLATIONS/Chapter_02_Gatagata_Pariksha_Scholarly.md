# Chapter 2: Gatagata-parīkṣā (गतागतपरीक्षा)
# Examination of Motion

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

---

## Introduction

Having refuted arising (*utpāda*) in Chapter 1, Nāgārjuna now examines motion (*gati*) to demonstrate that the characteristic of "non-coming and non-going" (*anāgama-anirgama*) applies to dependent origination. If motion—the most evident of phenomena—cannot withstand analysis, then no phenomenon possesses inherent nature.

## Kārikā 1: The Trilemma of Motion

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> gataṃ na gamyate tāvad agataṃ naiva gamyate |  
> gatāgatavinirmuktaṃ gamyamānaṃ na gamyate ||1||

### Translation:

> **[1]** What has been traversed (*gata*) is not being traversed;  
> What has not been traversed (*agata*) is certainly not being traversed.  
> Apart from what has been traversed and what has not been traversed,  
> What is being traversed (*gamyamāna*) is not being traversed.¹

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

The "gone-to" (*gata*) is that in which the action of going has ceased. The "being-gone-to" (*gamyamāna*) is that which is currently pervaded by the action of going. Since the "gone-to" has already exhausted its going-action, saying it "is being gone-to" is contradictory.²

The "not-yet-gone-to" (*agata*) has no going-action yet begun. But "is being traversed" (*gamyate*) is a present participle. Since past and present, future and present, are mutually exclusive, neither can be said to "be being traversed."

As for the "being-traversed"—this is examined separately and found not to exist apart from *gata* and *agata*.³

## Kārikā 2: The Opponent's Objection

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> ceṣṭā yatra gatis tatra gamyamāne ca sā yataḥ |  
> na gate nāgate ceṣṭā gamyamāne gatis tataḥ ||2||

### Translation:

> **[2]** "Where there is activity (*ceṣṭā*), there is motion.  
> And since that [activity] is in the being-traversed,  
> Not in the gone-to, not in the not-gone-to,  
> Therefore motion is in the being-traversed."⁴

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

The opponent argues: Activity—defined as the lifting and placing of feet—exists in the "being-traversed" space. It is not in the "gone-to" (already passed) nor in the "not-gone-to" (not yet reached). Therefore, motion exists and is located in the *gamyamāna*.⁵

## Kārikā 3: The Problem of Double Motion

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> gamyamānasya gamanaṃ kathaṃ nāmopapadyate |  
> gamyamāne dvigamanaṃ yadā naivopapadyate ||3||

### Translation:

> **[3]** How can motion of the being-traversed be established  
> When double motion in the being-traversed  
> Is entirely impossible?⁶

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

The designation "being-traversed" (*gamyamāna*) itself requires a going-action. If you then say this being-traversed "is being traversed" (*gamyate*), you require a second going-action. But there is only one action of going—it is already used up in the designation *gamyamāna*. Hence, *gamyamāne gamyate* requires two goings where only one exists.⁷

---

## Kārikā 4: Motion Without Action

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> gamyamānasya gamanaṃ yasya tasya prasajyate |  
> ṛte gater gamyamānaṃ gamyamānaṃ hi gamyate ||4||

### Translation:

> **[4]** For whomever there is motion of the being-traversed,  
> It follows that there would be  
> A being-traversed without motion—  
> For the being-traversed is [said to be] traversed.⁸

---

## Kārikā 5: Double Motion, Double Goer

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> gamyamānasya gamane prasaktaṃ gamanadvaymam |  
> yena tad gamyamānaṃ ca yac cātra gamanaṃ punaḥ ||5||

### Translation:

> **[5]** If there is motion of the being-traversed,  
> Double motion follows:  
> That by which it is "being-traversed,"  
> And again, that motion which [you say] is here.⁹

---

## Kārikā 6: Double Motion Requires Double Goer

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> dvau gantārau prasajyete prasakte gamanadvaye |  
> gantāraṃ hi tiraskṛtya gamanaṃ nopapadyate ||6||

### Translation:

> **[6]** If double motion follows,  
> Two goers would follow.  
> For without a goer,  
> Motion is not established.¹⁰

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

Action necessarily requires an agent (*kartṛ*). Going-action requires a goer. If there are two goings, there must be two goers. But in one Devadatta who is walking, there is not a second agent. Therefore, there cannot be double motion—and hence "the being-traversed is being traversed" is incoherent.¹¹

---

## Kārikā 7: No Goer Without Going

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> gantāraṃ cet tiraskṛtya gamanaṃ nopapadyate |  
> gamane 'sati gantātha kuta eva bhaviṣyati ||7||

### Translation:

> **[7]** If without a goer motion is not established,  
> Then in the absence of motion,  
> From where will a goer come to be?¹²

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

The goer depends on going, and going depends on the goer. Neither can be established first. This is the mutual dependence (*anyonyāśraya*) that undermines both.¹³

---

## Kārikā 8: The Trilemma of the Goer

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> gantā na gacchati tāvad agantā naiva gacchati |  
> anyo ganturgantṛuś ca kas tṛtīyo hi gacchati ||8||

### Translation:

> **[8]** The goer does not go;  
> The non-goer certainly does not go.  
> What third [entity] other than goer and non-goer  
> Goes?¹⁴

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

The "goer" (*gantṛ*) is defined as one who possesses going-action. But if he *already* possesses it, what more does "he goes" add? The non-goer, by definition, lacks going-action—so he certainly doesn't go. And there is no third option.¹⁵

---

## Kārikā 9-11: Further Analysis of Goer and Going

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> gantā tāvad gacchatīti katham evopapadyate |  
> gamanena vinā gantā yadā naivopapadyate ||9||

### Translation:

> **[9]** How can "the goer goes" be established  
> When without motion  
> A goer is entirely impossible?¹⁶

---

> pakṣo gantā gacchatīti yasya tasya prasajyate |  
> gamanena vinā gantā ganturgamanam icchataḥ ||10||

### Translation:

> **[10]** For whomever holds the position "the goer goes,"  
> It follows that there would be  
> A goer without motion—  
> For one who wants the goer to possess motion.¹⁷

---

> gamane dve prasajyete gantā yady uta gacchati |  
> ganteti cocyate yena gantā san yac ca gacchati ||11||

### Translation:

> **[11]** If a goer goes,  
> Double motion follows:  
> That by which he is called "goer,"  
> And—being a goer—that which he goes.¹⁸

---

## Kārikā 12-14: No Beginning of Motion

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> gate nārabhyate gantuṃ gantuṃ nārabhyate 'gate |  
> nārabhyate gamyamāne gantum ārabhyate kuha ||12||

### Translation:

> **[12]** In the gone-to, going is not begun;  
> In the not-gone-to, going is not begun;  
> In the being-gone-to, going is not begun—  
> Where then is going begun?¹⁹

---

> na pūrvaṃ gamanārambhād gamyamānaṃ na vā gatam |  
> yatrārabhyeta gamanam agate gamanaṃ kutaḥ ||13||

### Translation:

> **[13]** Prior to the beginning of motion,  
> There is neither a "being-traversed" nor a "traversed"  
> Where motion might begin.  
> And in the not-yet-traversed—how could there be motion?²⁰

---

> gataṃ kiṃ gamyamānaṃ kim agataṃ kiṃ vikalpyate |  
> adṛśyamāna ārambhe gamanasyaiva sarvathā ||14||

### Translation:

> **[14]** What "gone-to"? What "being-traversed"? What "not-gone-to"?  
> How can these be conceived  
> When the beginning of motion  
> Is not perceived anywhere at all?²¹

---

## Kārikā 15-17: Standing and Motion

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> gantā na tiṣṭhati tāvad agantā naiva tiṣṭhati |  
> anyo gantur agantruś ca kas tṛtīyo 'tha tiṣṭhati ||15||

### Translation:

> **[15]** The goer does not stand;  
> The non-goer certainly does not stand.  
> What third [entity] other than goer and non-goer  
> Stands?²²

---

> gantā tāvat tiṣṭhatīti katham evopapadyate |  
> gamanena vinā gantā yadā naivopapadyate ||16||

### Translation:

> **[16]** How can "the goer stands" be established  
> When without motion  
> A goer is entirely impossible?²³

---

> na tiṣṭhati gamyamānān na gatān nāgatād api |  
> gamanaṃ saṃpravṛttiś ca nivṛttiś ca gateḥ samā ||17||

### Translation:

> **[17]** He does not come to stand from the being-traversed,  
> Nor from the traversed, nor from the not-traversed.  
> Motion, beginning [of motion], and cessation [of motion]  
> Are [all refuted] the same as motion.²⁴

---

## Kārikā 18-21: Identity and Difference

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> yad eva gamanaṃ gantā sa eveti na yujyate |  
> anya eva punar gantā gater iti na yujyate ||18||

### Translation:

> **[18]** That the goer is identical with the motion  
> Is not tenable.  
> That the goer is different from the motion  
> Is also not tenable.²⁵

---

> yad eva gamanaṃ gantā sa eva hi bhaved yadi |  
> ekībhāvaḥ prasajyeta kartuḥ karmaṇa eva ca ||19||

### Translation:

> **[19]** If the goer were identical with the motion,  
> Identity of agent (*kartṛ*) and action (*karma*)  
> Would follow.²⁶

---

> anya eva punar gantā gater yadi vikalpyate |  
> gamanaṃ syād ṛte gantur gantā syād gamanaṃ ṛte ||20||

### Translation:

> **[20]** If the goer is conceived as different from the motion,  
> There would be motion without a goer,  
> And a goer without motion.²⁷

---

> ekībhāvena vā siddhir nānābhāvena vā yayoḥ |  
> na vidyate tayoḥ siddhiḥ kathaṃ nu khalu vidyate ||21||

### Translation:

> **[21]** When the establishment of these two  
> Is not found through identity or through difference—  
> How indeed could their establishment be found?²⁸

---

## Kārikā 22-24: The Goer and His Going

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> gatyā yayocyate gantā gatiṃ tāṃ sa na gacchati |  
> yasmān na gatipūrvo 'sti kaścit kiṃcid dhi gacchati ||22||

### Translation:

> **[22]** The goer, who is designated by a going,  
> Does not go that going.  
> For prior to going there is no one [already a goer]—  
> [And yet] someone goes somewhere.²⁹

---

> gatyā yayocyate gantā tato 'nyāṃ sa na gacchati |  
> gatī dve nopapadyete yasmād eke pra gacchati ||23||

### Translation:

> **[23]** The goer, who is designated by a going,  
> Does not go a different going.  
> For in one [person], two goings  
> Are not established.³⁰

---

> sadbhūto gamanaṃ gantā triprakāraṃ na gacchati |  
> nāsadbhūto 'pi gamanaṃ triprakāraṃ sa gacchati ||24||  
> gamanaṃ sadasadbhūtaṃ triprakāraṃ ca na gacchati |

### Translation:

> **[24]** An existent goer does not go  
> The three kinds of motion.  
> A non-existent [goer] also does not go  
> The three kinds of motion.  
> [A goer that is] both existent and non-existent  
> Does not go the three kinds of motion.³¹

---

## Kārikā 25: Conclusion

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> tasmād gatiś ca gantā ca gantavyaṃ ca na vidyate ||25||

### Translation:

> **[25]** Therefore, motion, goer, and destination (*gantavya*)  
> Do not exist [with inherent nature].³²

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

Thus, when examined, motion, the goer, and the destination cannot be found with inherent nature. As stated in the *Ākṣayamatinirdeśa-sūtra*:

> *"Non-going is a term of attraction; going is a term of repulsion. Where there is neither attraction nor repulsion—that is the path of the noble ones. By non-entry and non-going is the noble ones' going spoken of."*

And in the *Lalitavistara*:

> *"Just as from the seed there is the sprout, and yet neither is what was the seed identical with the sprout, nor is it entirely other—so is the nature of dharmas: neither annihilated nor eternal."*³³

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Footnotes (1-33)

¹ **[Dialectical]** The threefold division—past, present, future applied to space—structures the entire chapter.

² **[Sanskrit]** *gata* = past passive participle of √gam. Literally "gone-to," "traversed."

³ **[Philosophical]** The *gamyamāna* (being-traversed) is shown to be a mere concept with no reality apart from the other two.

⁴ **[Dialectical]** The opponent is likely a Sarvāstivādin who asserts the real existence of all three times.

⁵ **[Sanskrit]** *ceṣṭā* = activity, movement, exertion. From √ceṣṭ, to move.

⁶ **[Philosophical]** The problem of double action: if "being-traversed" already uses one going, adding "is being traversed" requires a second.

⁷ **[Cross-reference]** This argument structure parallels MMK 1.6-7 (double action in conditions).

⁸ **[Dialectical]** A *prasaṅga*: the opponent's position leads to accepting motion-less "being-traversed."

⁹ **[Sanskrit]** *gamana-dvaya* = double motion. The technical term for this objection.

¹⁰ **[Philosophical]** Agent requires action; double action requires double agent. But there's only one Devadatta.

¹¹ **[Historical]** Candrakīrti explicitly uses "Devadatta" as the standard example of a person.

¹² **[Philosophical]** Mutual dependence (*anyonyāśraya*): neither term can be established first.

¹³ **[Cross-reference]** This structure appears again in Chapter 10 (Fire and Fuel).

¹⁴ **[Dialectical]** Exhaustive trilemma: goer, non-goer, or other—all fail.

¹⁵ **[Modern]** Cf. Wittgenstein's problem of "adding" in rule-following: what does repetition add?

¹⁶ **[Sanskrit]** *gantṛ* = goer, agent of going. From √gam + tṛ (agent suffix).

¹⁷ **[Dialectical]** Reductio: the opponent must accept goer-without-going to make "goer goes" work.

¹⁸ **[Philosophical]** The same double-action argument applied to the goer.

¹⁹ **[Philosophical]** Motion cannot *begin* in any of the three temporal spaces—past, present, or future.

²⁰ **[Cross-reference]** This parallels MMK 7 (Examination of the Conditioned).

²¹ **[Philosophical]** If motion has no beginning, the threefold distinction collapses.

²² **[Dialectical]** The same trilemma now applied to "standing" (*sthiti*).

²³ **[Philosophical]** "Goer stands" is as incoherent as "goer goes."

²⁴ **[Sanskrit]** *saṃpravṛtti* = beginning, initiation. *nivṛtti* = cessation.

²⁵ **[Philosophical]** Identity and difference—the two options exhausted.

²⁶ **[Sanskrit]** *kartṛ-karma ekībhāva* = identity of agent and action. Contradicts ordinary language.

²⁷ **[Dialectical]** Difference implies independence—but goer and going are never found apart.

²⁸ **[Cross-reference]** This verse reappears nearly verbatim in several later chapters.

²⁹ **[Philosophical]** Pre-existing goer problem: you can't be a "goer" before going.

³⁰ **[Sanskrit]** *eke* = in one [person]. There is no second going in a single individual.

³¹ **[Philosophical]** The threefold (existent, non-existent, both) combined with threefold (three kinds of motion) = 9 cases, all refuted.

³² **[Historical]** This is the formal conclusion—all three terms (*gati*, *gantṛ*, *gantavya*) lack svabhāva.

³³ **[Cross-reference]** The *Lalitavistara* verse on seed and sprout directly parallels Chapter 1's argument.

### Key Concepts (Chapter 2)

- **gata** (गत): The "gone-to," past tense of space traversed
- **agata** (अगत): The "not-yet-gone-to," future space
- **gamyamāna** (गम्यमान): The "being-gone-to," present space
- **gantṛ** (गन्तृ): Goer, agent of motion
- **gati/gamana** (गति/गमन): Motion, going
- **gantavya** (गन्तव्य): Destination, that which is to be gone to
- **ceṣṭā** (चेष्टा): Activity, physical exertion

---

### Argument Structure

| Term Examined | Problem Found |
|:--------------|:--------------|
| Gata (gone-to) | Going has ceased—cannot be "being traversed" |
| Agata (not-gone-to) | Going hasn't begun—cannot be "being traversed" |
| Gamyamāna (being-traversed) | Requires double motion, therefore double goer |
| Gantṛ (goer) | Defined by going, yet "goer goes" needs second going |
| Gati (motion) | Cannot begin in any of the three spaces |
| Gantavya (destination) | Falls with goer and motion |

### Soul Check Hints for Bluesman

**Blues Translation Guidance:**

1. **Verse 1**: "Where you been ain't being walked. Where you going ain't being walked. And that space you're standing in? When you look for the walking, it ain't there neither."

2. **Verse 8**: "The walker don't walk—'cause if he's already walking, what's 'he walks' adding? The non-walker don't walk—that's just words. And there ain't nobody else."

3. **Verse 12-14**: "You can't start walking in where you already been. You can't start walking in where you haven't got to yet. And you can't start walking in where you're at—'cause there ain't no 'where you're at' apart from been and going."

4. **Verse 25**: "So the walking, the walker, and where he's going—all three come up empty when you really look."

5. **Core insight**: Motion is the most obvious thing in the world. If it turns out to be empty of inherent nature, everything is.
