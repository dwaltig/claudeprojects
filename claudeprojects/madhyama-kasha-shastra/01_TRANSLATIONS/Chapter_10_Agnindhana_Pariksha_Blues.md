**Title: "Burnin' Without Wood"**

(Verse 1)
If the Fire is the Wood, Lord, tell me what it burns?
(Like a dog chasin' tails, twistin' in the turns)
But if the Fire ain't the Wood, floatin' in the air,
Then you got a phantom flame that just ain't there.

(Verse 2)
You say your love is eternal, don't need no spark,
(Glowin' like a neon sign deep in the dark)
But if you don't need lightin', you don't need a match,
Just a lonely old door without no latch.

(Verse 3)
If you don't need nobody, you don't need to try,
(Sittin' on a mountain, high in the sky)
But a fire that burns without no wood to eat,
Is a cold, cold lie in the summer heat.

(Verse 4)
You met me at the station, distinct as day and night,
(We shook hands politely, tryin' to be polite)
But if I’m the water and you’re the stone,
We can touch forever, but I’m still alone.

(Verse 5)
If you can't reach me, baby, you can't make me cry,
(Just a distant thunder in a cloudy sky)
If the fire don't touch, the wood stays green,
The saddest situation that I ever seen.

(Verse 6)
You say it’s like a lover walkin' through the door,
(Like a man and a woman on the dance floor)
But lovers walk away when the dance is through,
The Fire eats the Wood, baby, that ain't me and you.

(Verse 7)
I can hold your hand, but I can't steal your soul,
(Unless we’re mixin' ashes in the same old bowl)
If we’re truly different, we can never blend,
Just two strangers waitin' for the end.

(Verse 8)
Did the blues start the trouble, or the trouble start the blues?
(I’m walkin' in circles in my travelin' shoes)
Can't have a shadow without the man,
Can't have the man without the master plan.

(Verse 9)
If the Fire needs the Wood to say its name,
(Who was holdin' the match before the flame?)
If the Wood needs the Fire to make it burn,
It’s a broken record that just won't turn.

(Verse 10)
A father makes a son, a son makes a dad,
(Best family riddle that I ever had)
If nobody’s first, then nobody’s last,
Just a ghost train movin' way too fast.

(Verse 11)
If you ain't got a job, you can't get paid,
(But you need the money for the trade you made)
If you’re already rich, you don't need a dime,
If you’re broke, you’re just wastin' precious time.

(Verse 12)
The Fire don't lean on the Wood, no sir,
(And the Wood don't lean on the Fire, that’s clear)
They ain't hooked up, and they ain't apart,
Just a hole in the middle of a achin' heart.

(Verse 13)
The flame didn't come from the city lights,
(And it ain't hidin' in the wood on winter nights)
It didn't go away, and it didn't stay,
It just flashed and faded, then it blew away.

(Verse 14)
The Wood ain't the Fire, the Fire ain't the Wood,
(You couldn't catch 'em separate if you understood)
The Fire don't own the Wood like a man owns land,
It’s slippin' like water through your open hand.

(Verse 15)
So listen to the Fire and listen to the Soul,
(It’s the same old story that the Buddha told)
The Pot ain't the Clay, the Cloth ain't the Thread,
If you look for the Self, you’re talkin' to the dead.

(Verse 16)
If you think you’re a Soul in a bag of skin,
(Separate from the world that you livin' in)
You can read all the books on the dusty shelf,
But you don't know nothin' 'bout the Self.
