## Verse 10.1
**yad indhanaṃ sa evāgnir ekatvaṃ kartṛkarmaṇoḥ |**
**anyaś ced indhanād agnir indhanād apy ṛte bhavet ||**

**Translation**:
"If the fuel were the fire, there would be identity between the agent and the object.
If the fire were distinct from the fuel, it would exist even without the fuel."

**Commentary**:
*   **Kartṛ-karmaṇoḥ** ("Agent and Object"): *Agni* (Fire) acts upon *Indhana* (Fuel). If they are identical (*ekatva*), the burner burns itself. This mirrors the Self (*kartṛ*) acting on the Aggregates (*karma*).
*   **Ṛte bhavet** ("Would exist without"): The consequence of dualism. A fire independent of fuel is a logical impossibility, yet implied by "difference."

---

## Verse 10.2
**nityapradīpta eva syād apradīpanahetukaḥ |**
**punarārambhavaiyarthyam evaṃ cākarmakaḥ sati ||**

**Translation**:
"[If distinct], it would be eternally burning; it would not have ignition as its cause.
The futility of re-ignition [would follow], and being thus, it would be without action."

**Commentary**:
*   **Nitya-pradīpta** ("Eternally burning"): If Fire doesn't need Fuel to exist, it shouldn't need Fuel to *start* burning. It would be an eternal, uncaused entity (*svabhāva*).
*   **Akarmaka** ("Without action"): It would have no work (*burning*) to do.

---

## Verse 10.3
**paratra nirapekṣatvād apradīpanahetukaḥ |**
**punarārambhavaiyarthyaṃ nityadīptaḥ prasajyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Due to independence from another, it would not have ignition as its cause.
The futility of re-ignition implies it is eternally burning."

**Commentary**:
*   **Paratra nirapekṣatvād** ("Due to independence from the other"): Reiterating the absurdity of independence. A Self independent of the Body/Mind would be immutable and unaffected by karma.

---

## Verse 10.4
**tatraitasmād idhmād anyo yadi syād agnir īkṣyate |**
**indhanena samīpyeta na cainam upadhakṣyati ||**

**Translation**:
"In that case, if fire is observed to be other than this fuel,
It might meet with the fuel, but it would not burn it."

**Commentary**:
*   **Samīpyeta** ("Might meet"): Mere contact (*sparśa*). If they are fundamentally different substances (like a pot and a cloth), they can touch, but one cannot consume the other.

---

## Verse 10.5
**anyo na prāpnuyān nāprāpto dahati ceṣyate |**
**na cā nirvāpayed agnir na tiṣṭhet svasvalakṣaṇaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Being other, it would not reach [the fuel]; and not reaching it, it is not admitted to burn.
And the fire would not be extinguished; it would stand with its own specific characteristic."

**Commentary**:
*   **Svasvalakṣaṇa** ("Own specific characteristic"): If Fire is separate, it retains its "heat" forever, never transforming into ash or cooling down. It becomes frozen in its nature.

---

## Verse 10.6
**anyo na prāpnuyān nāprāpto dahati ceṣyate |**
**strī saṃprāpnoti puruṣaṃ puruṣaś ca striyaṃ yathā ||**

**Translation**:
"Being other, it would not reach... [reiteration].
[The opponent says:] Just as a woman reaches a man, and a man reaches a woman."

**Commentary**:
*   **Strī/Puruṣa** ("Woman/Man"): The opponent uses an analogy of two distinct agents meeting. Nāgārjuna rejects this: Men and Women retain their identity after meeting; they do not consume each other. Fire, however, consumes Fuel; its existence depends on the transformation of the other. Thus, mere "meeting" of distinct entities is a false analogy.

---

## Verse 10.7
**anyad anyena saṃprāptaṃ yadi syād agnīndhanam |**
**syātāṃ prāpya tu na dahyetām anyenānyasya dahanāt ||**

**Translation**:
"If fire and fuel were separate, and one reached the other,
Then upon reaching, they would exist [unchanged]; for nothing burns what is other than itself."

**Commentary**:
*   **Na dahyetām** ("Would not burn"): If A is intrinsically different from B, A cannot essentialize/transmute B. Intrinsic nature (*svabhāva*) is immutable.

---

## Verse 10.8
**yad indhanam apekṣyāgnir apekṣyāgnim yad indhanam |**
**katarat pūrvaniṣpannaṃ yad apekṣyāgnir indhanam ||**

**Translation**:
"If fire depends on fuel, and fuel depends on fire—
Which one is established prior, on which the fire depends?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Pūrva-niṣpanna** ("Established prior"): The circularity trap. To have a dependency (*apekṣā*), one term must exist to depend on the other. Who starts the cycle?

---

## Verse 10.9
**yad indhanam apekṣyāgnir agneḥ siddhasya sādhanam |**
**evaṃ satīndhanaṃ cāpi bhaviṣyati niragnikam ||**

**Translation**:
"If fire depends on fuel, there is the establishment of an already established fire.
And in that case, fuel also would exist without fire."

**Commentary**:
*   **Agneḥ siddhasya** ("Of established fire"): If Fire exists *to* depend on Fuel, it must already exist. Why then does it need Fuel?
*   **Niragnikam** ("Fire-less"): If Fuel is waiting for Fire, it exists as a substance independent of burning. But wood is not "fuel" until it burns.

---

## Verse 10.10
**yo 'pekṣya sidhyate bhāvas tam evāpekṣya sidhyati |**
**yadi yo 'pekṣitavyaḥ sa sidhyatāṃ kamapekṣya kaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"If an entity is established depending on [another], and that [other] is established depending on [the first]—
If the one to be depended upon is [yet] to be established, depending on what does which one [arise]?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Kam apekṣya kaḥ** ("Depending on what does which?"): The classic "Father and Son" paradox. A father makes a son, but a son makes a man a "father." Neither has priority.

---

## Verse 10.11
**yo 'pekṣya sidhyate bhāvaḥ so 'siddho 'pekṣate katham |**
**athāpy api siddhaḥ sa 'pekṣate kim apekṣate ||**

**Translation**:
"If an entity to be established depends [on another], how does it depend if it is unestablished?
And if it is established, what does it depend on?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Asiddhaḥ** ("Unestablished"): A non-existent thing cannot "depend" on anything. A rabbit's horn cannot depend on a rabbit.
*   **Siddhaḥ** ("Established"): An existing thing needs no support.

---

## Verse 10.12
**apekṣyendhanam agnir na nānalekṣyāgnir indhanam |**
**apekṣyendhanaṃ nāgnir na nānalekṣyāgnim indhanam ||**

**Translation**:
"Fire does not depend on fuel; nor does fire not depend on fuel.
Fuel does not depend on fire; nor does fuel not depend on fire."

**Commentary**:
*   **Na... na** ("Neither... nor"): The rejection of all four positions (*catuṣkoṭi* negation). Dependency is empty; Independence is empty.

---

## Verse 10.13
**āgacchaty anyato nāgnir indhane 'gnir na vidyate |**
**atrenandhanam śeṣaṃ gamyamānagatāgataiḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Fire does not come from elsewhere; and fire is not found in the fuel.
Here, the remainder regarding fuel [is explained] by the 'being gone to,' 'gone,' and 'not gone.'"

**Commentary**:
*   **Gamyamāna...** ("Being gone to..."): Reference to Chapter 2 (*Gatāgata*). Just as "motion" is not in the path, "burning" is not in the wood.

---

## Verse 10.14
**indhanaṃ punar agnir na nāgnir anyatra cendhanāt |**
**nāgnir indhanavān nāgnāv indhanāni na teṣu saḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Fuel is not fire; fire does not exist elsewhere than fuel.
Fire does not possess fuel; fuel is not in fire, nor is it in them."

**Commentary**:
*   **Indhanavān** ("Possessing fuel"): Rejection of the Self "possessing" aggregates.
*   **Na teṣu saḥ** ("He is not in them"): Rejection of the Self as a container for aggregates.

---

## Verse 10.15
**agnīndhanābhyāṃ vyākhyāta ātmopādānayoḥ kramaḥ |**
**sarvo niravaśeṣeṇa sārdhaṃ ghaṭapaṭādibhiḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"By [the analysis of] fire and fuel, the procedure for [analyzing] Self and Appropriation is explained;
All [views], without remainder, together with [views on] pot, cloth, and so forth."

**Commentary**:
*   **Ātma-upādāna** ("Self and Appropriation"): The target. Fire = Self; Fuel = Five Aggregates.
*   **Ghaṭa-paṭa** ("Pot and Cloth"): The method extends to all objects. There is no "Pot-essence" apart from clay. *See also Chapter 5 (Dhātu-parīkṣā) where the separation of space and its characteristic is refuted using similar logic.*

## Verse 10.16
**ātmanas ca satattvaṃ ye bhāvānāṃ ca pṛthak pṛthak |**
**nirdiśanti na tān manye śāsanasyārthakovidān ||**

**Translation**:
"Those who teach the reality of the Self and of entities separately—
I do not consider them to be experts in the meaning of the Teaching."

**Commentary**:
*   **Artha-kovidān** ("Experts in meaning"): A sharp rebuke. Dualists (Sāṃkhyas, Naiyāyikas, and Abhidharmikas who reify dharmas) miss the Buddha's intent. Emptiness is the true Teaching.
