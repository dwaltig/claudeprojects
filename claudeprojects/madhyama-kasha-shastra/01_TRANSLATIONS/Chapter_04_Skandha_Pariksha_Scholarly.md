## Verse 4.1
**rūpakāraṇanirmukte rūpaṃ nopalabhyate |**
**rūpeṇa cāpi nirmuktaṃ dṛśyate naiva kāraṇam ||**

**Translation**:
"Apart from the cause of form, form is not perceived.
And apart from form, the cause of form is not seen either."

**Commentary**:
*   **Rūpa-kāraṇa** ("Cause of Form"): The four great elements (Earth, Water, Fire, Wind).
*   **Derived Form** (*bhautika-rūpa*): The objects we see (colors, shapes).
*   **Sectarian Context**: The **Sarvāstivādins** held that the Elements and Derived Form were distinct substantial dharmas (*dravya*). The **Sautrāntikas** argued they were merely conceptual distinctions. Nāgārjuna refutes both by showing they are mutually dependent and thus empty.

## Verse 4.2
**rūpakāraṇanirmukte rūpe cet kalpyate punaḥ |**
**ahetukam syād rūpaṃ tu na kva cid vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"If form were imagined apart from the cause of form,
Form would be without cause; but [an uncaused thing] is nowhere found."

**Commentary**:
*   **Ahetukam** ("Uncaused"): If Form exists independently of its elements, it needs no cause. It would be eternal or random.

## Verse 4.3
**rūpeṇa tu vinir-muktaṃ yadi syād rūpakāraṇam |**
**akāryakaṃ kāraṇaṃ syād akāryaṃ naiva vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"If the cause of form were separate from form,
The cause would be without an effect; but a cause without an effect is not found."

**Commentary**:
*   **Akāryakaṃ** ("Without effect"): A cause is only a "cause" if it produces something. "Father" implies "Child."

## Verse 4.4
**rūpakāraṇasambhūte rūpe rūpe na vidyate |**
**rūpakāraṇasambhūte rūpe kiṃ kāraṇaṃ bhavet ||**

**Translation**:
"When form has arisen from the cause of form, [a new] form does not exist.
When form has not arisen from the cause of form, how could there be a cause?"

**Commentary**:
*   **The Dilemma**: Does the cause produce a form that already exists? (Redundant). Or one that doesn't exist? (Impossible).

## Verse 4.7
**vedanācittasaṃjñānāṃ saṃskārāṇāṃ ca sarvaśaḥ |**
**sarveṣām eva bhāvānāṃ rūpeṇaiva samaḥ kramaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"For feeling, discrimination, dispositions, and consciousness, in every way—
For all existing things, the procedure is the same as for form."

**Commentary**:
*   **Atideśa** ("Extension"): The logic applied to Form applies to the mental aggregates.
*   **Vedanā** (Feeling): Dependent on contact.
*   **Saṃjñā** (Discrimination/Perception): Dependent on signs.
*   **Saṃskāra** (Formations): Dependent on volition.
*   **Vijñāna** (Consciousness): Dependent on name-and-form.

## Verse 4.8
**vigrahe yaḥ parīhāraṃ kṛte śūnyatayā vadet |**
**sarvaṃ tasyāparihṛtaṃ samaṃ sādhyena sādhayet ||**

**Translation**:
"When an analysis is made through emptiness, if someone were to offer a rejoinder,
All that is unanswered by him; he would be proving what is to be proven by what is to be proven."

**Commentary**:
*   **Sādhyasama** ("Same as the thesis"): A logical fallacy (*hetvābhāsa*). If you try to refute Emptiness by pointing to "Real Things," you are assuming the very thing (Real Things) that is in question. You are using the premise as the proof.

## Verse 4.9
**vyākhyāne ya upālambhaṃ kṛte śūnyatayā vadet |**
**sarvaṃ tasyānupālabdhaṃ samaṃ sādhyena sādhayet ||**

**Translation**:
"When an explanation is given through emptiness, if someone were to find fault,
All that is uncriticized by him; he would be proving what is to be proven by what is to be proven."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Final Word**: Emptiness is not a "view" that can be attacked by another "view." It is the deconstruction of views. To attack it is to attack the very ground of logic itself.
