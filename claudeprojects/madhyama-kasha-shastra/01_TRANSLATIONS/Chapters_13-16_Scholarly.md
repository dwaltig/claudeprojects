## Chapter 13: Saṃskāra-parīkṣā (Examination of Formations)

### Introduction
This chapter deconstructs *saṃskāras* (volitional formations, the fourth *skandha*), the conditioned forces that propel *saṃsāra*. Nāgārjuna targets the Abhidharma view of these as real, efficacious dharmas, demonstrating their emptiness and thus severing the link between action and fixed karmic result.

### Key Verses Summarized
- **v.1:** If *saṃskāras* were intrinsically real, they'd be eternal and not subject to cessation—contradicting their observed impermanence.
- **v.3:** Actions (karma) are like a phantom, a mirage; they lack substantiality. "The wise do not see existent or non-existent *dharmas*."
- **v.8:** Emptiness of *saṃskāras* implies the emptiness of the agent and experiencer, undermining any fixed subject-object relation in karma.

### Core Argument
- *Saṃskāras* as substantial entities would be unchanging—contradicting the Buddhist understanding of impermanence.
- The analysis reveals that what we call "mental formations" are processes without a fixed core.
- This undermines any reification of karmic causation, though conventional karma remains operative.

### Key Terms

| **Saṃskāra** | Formations, volitions | The fourth aggregate; karmic conditioning |
| **Māyā** | Illusion, phantom | Paradigm for empty yet apparent phenomena |
| **Dharma-lakṣaṇa** | Characteristic of a dharma | What defines a dharma—here shown to be unfindable |

## Chapter 14: Saṃsarga-parīkṣā (Examination of Conjunction)

### Introduction
This chapter analyzes whether the three fundamental components of cognition—the seer (*draṣṭṛ*), the seen (*dṛśya*), and the act of seeing (*darśana*)—can inherently "conjoin" (*saṃsarga*). The conclusion: their apparent conjunction is merely conventional, not ultimately real.

### Key Verses Summarized
- **v.1:** The seer, seen, and seeing are not established as being together, in pairs, or singly with inherent existence.
- **v.5:** These three are like the characteristic-characterized analysis: each requires the others for its very identity.
- **v.8:** Their conjunction is not ultimately findable; they are dependently designated rather than substantially conjoined.

### Core Argument
- Cognition appears to require a knowing subject, a known object, and a knowing act—but none has independent existence.
- The "meeting" of these three is a conceptual imputation, not an event between substances.
- This analysis extends to all triads in experience (hearer-heard-hearing, etc.).

### Key Terms

| Sanskrit | English | Note |
|----------|---------|------|
| **Saṃsarga** | Conjunction, meeting | The apparent joining of cognitive factors |
| **Draṣṭṛ** | Seer, perceiver | The subjective pole |
| **Dṛśya** | Seen, visible | The objective pole |
| **Darśana** | Seeing, vision | The cognitive act |

## Chapter 15: Svabhāva-parīkṣā (Examination of Own-Nature)

### THE CENTRAL CHAPTER

### Introduction
Chapter 15 is the philosophical epicenter of the *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā*. Here Nāgārjuna definitively articulates what *svabhāva* (own-nature, intrinsic nature, self-existence) means and why its negation is central to Mādhyamaka. **This chapter defines the *dgag bya*—the "object of negation"—upon which the entire project rests.**

### Key Verses Summarized
- **v.1-2:** *Svabhāva* cannot arise from causes and conditions. If it did, it would be dependent and thus not "self-nature." Something produced by conditions is *parabhāva* (other-nature), not *svabhāva*.
- **v.5:** The teaching of emptiness is the abandonment of all views (*dṛṣṭi*). Those who make emptiness itself into a view are incorrigible.
- **v.8-9:** Without *svabhāva*, there can be no "other-nature" (*parabhāva*). Without intrinsic existence or otherness, there is no entity or non-entity. Neither existence nor non-existence applies to empty phenomena.
- **v.10-11:** Those who see *svabhāva* and *parabhāva* do not see the truth of the Buddha's teaching. The correct view is dependent origination—the Middle Way between the extremes of existence and non-existence.

### Core Argument
1. ***Svabhāva* is that which is uncaused, independent, and unchanging.** Anything arising from conditions cannot have *svabhāva*.
2. **All phenomena arise from conditions (pratītyasamutpāda).** Therefore, nothing has *svabhāva*.
3. **Emptiness does not mean non-existence.** It means the absence of inherent, independent existence. Phenomena exist conventionally, but their mode of existence is dependent, not self-sufficient.

### Key Distinction: *Svabhāva* vs. *Parabhāva* vs. *Abhāva*

| Term | Meaning | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| **Svabhāva** | Own-nature, intrinsic existence | Negated: nothing has this |
| **Parabhāva** | Other-nature, existence dependent on another | Also negated: presupposes the *svabhāva* of that other |
| **Bhāva** | Entity, existent | Conventionally real; not intrinsically real |
| **Abhāva** | Non-entity, non-existence | Also a conceptual extreme to be rejected |
| **Śūnyatā** | Emptiness | The absence of *svabhāva*; not a thing, not nothing |

### The Middle Way

> "Whatever is dependently arisen is explained to be emptiness. That, being a dependent designation, is itself the Middle Way." (MMK 24.18, previewed in Ch. 15)

### Key Terms

| Sanskrit | English | Note |
|----------|---------|------|
| **Svabhāva** | Own-nature, intrinsic existence | The central object of negation (*dgag bya*) |
| **Parabhāva** | Other-nature | Existence through another; also refuted |
| **Pratītyasamutpāda** | Dependent origination | The positive corollary of emptiness |
| **Dṛṣṭi** | View, opinion | All fixed views, including "emptiness is a thing," are abandoned |
| **Madhyamā pratipad** | Middle Way | The path between eternalism and nihilism |

## Chapter 16: Bandhamokṣa-parīkṣā (Examination of Bondage and Liberation)

### Introduction
This chapter addresses the soteriological implications of emptiness: if there is no inherently existent self, who is bound in *saṃsāra* and who attains *nirvāṇa*? Nāgārjuna shows that bondage and liberation are themselves empty, thereby grounding the Buddhist path without reifying its practitioner.

### Key Verses Summarized
- **v.1-4:** Neither the aggregates (*skandha*) nor a separate self (*ātman*) can be shown to be bound or liberated. The aggregates arise and cease; they cannot be "bound" in any fixed way. A permanent self, if it existed, could never change its state.
- **v.5-8:** If *saṃsāras* themselves (the aspects of cyclic existence) were to bind or be freed, this too fails analysis. The very concepts presuppose a fixed entity to undergo these transitions.
- **v.9-10:** *Saṃsāra* is not fundamentally different from *nirvāṇa*. *Nirvāṇa* is simply *saṃsāra* seen without the superimposition of *svabhāva*, grasping, and the false extremes.

### Core Argument
- Bondage and liberation are dependently arisen states, not intrinsic properties of a self. A seeker with *svabhāva* could never change.
- The question "Who is bound?" presupposes the very self-view (*satkāyadṛṣṭi*) being negated. The question is a category error.
- *Nirvāṇa* is not a "place" or "state of a self"—it is the pacification of all reifying projections (*prapañca*) within dependent arising.

### Key Terms

| Sanskrit | English | Note |
|----------|---------|------|
| **Bandha** | Bondage | The state of being trapped in *saṃsāra* |
| **Mokṣa** | Liberation, release | Freedom from bondage; shown to be empty |
| **Saṃsāra** | Cyclic existence | Dependent arising misperceived through ignorance |
| **Nirvāṇa** | Extinction of suffering | Not opposite to *saṃsāra*, but its correct understanding |
| **Pudgala** | Person | Conventional referent, mistakenly reified as a self |

**Scholarly Note:** Chapters 13-16 form a cohesive unit. 13-14 dismantle key pillars of subjective experience. **Chapter 15 delivers the definitive metaphysical critique.** Chapter 16 applies this critique to soteriology, ensuring emptiness coherently explains the path from bondage to liberation.
