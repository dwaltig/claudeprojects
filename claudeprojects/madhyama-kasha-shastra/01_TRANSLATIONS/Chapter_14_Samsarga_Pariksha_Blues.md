**Title: "We Ain't Never Met"**

(Verse 1)
The Seer and the Seen, standin' eye to eye,
(Like two old lovers 'neath a stormy sky)
They try to touch, they try to make a connection,
But it’s just a trick of the light, a ghostly reflection.

(Verse 2)
The Lover and the Beloved, burnin' with desire,
(Thinkin' they can meet inside the ring of fire)
But the fire ain't separate from the wood it burns,
It’s a lonely lesson that the heart never learns.

(Verse 3)
To shake a man’s hand, you gotta be apart,
(Different names, different faces, different heart)
But if we’re truly different, like the oil and the rain,
We just slide on by, ridin' separate trains.

(Verse 4)
If you ain't got a "Me," you can't have a "You,"
(That’s the hardest logic that a man can chew)
Association is a game for things that are real,
But we’re just shadows spinnin' on a wheel.

(Verse 5)
"Left" needs "Right" just to know its name,
(Without the other side, it’s a losin' game)
If you take away the "Right," the "Left" is gone,
Just a heavy silence where the word belongs.

(Verse 6)
If "Different" was real, it would stand alone,
(Like a king on a mountain, sittin' on a throne)
It wouldn't need a neighbor to define its face,
But nothin' stands alone in this empty place.

(Verse 7)
Difference ain't hidin' in the things you see,
(It ain't in the bird and it ain't in the tree)
If you can't find "Different," you can't find "The Same,"
It’s just empty smoke risin' from the flame.

(Verse 8)
So don't try to hold me, don't try to bind,
(There ain't no glue in the universal mind)
The Meetin', the Met, and the Meeting Place,
Are just clouds dissolvin' in infinite space.
