## Verse 5.1
**nākāśaṃ vidyate kiṃcit pūrvam ākāśalakṣaṇāt |**
**alakṣaṇaṃ prasajyeta syāt pūrvam yadi lakṣaṇāt ||**

**Translation**:
"Space (*ākāśa*) does not exist at all prior to the characteristic of space.
If it existed prior to the characteristic, it would follow that it is without characteristic."

**Commentary**:
*   **Prasannapadā**: The opponent argues that the six elements (Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Space, Consciousness) are the fundamental building blocks of reality. Nāgārjuna chooses Space (*ākāśa*) because it is often considered unconditioned (*asaṃskṛta*) or eternal.
*   **The Dilemma**: A substance cannot exist without its defining attribute. Fire is not Fire without Heat. Space is not Space without "non-obstruction" (*anāvaraṇa*).

## Verse 5.2
**alakṣaṇo na kaścic ca bhāvaḥ saṃvidyate kva cit |**
**asaty alakṣaṇe bhāve kramatā kuṭa lakṣaṇam ||**

**Translation**:
"An entity without characteristic is not found anywhere.
When an entity without characteristic does not exist, where does the characteristic apply?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Lakṣaṇa-Lakṣya** ("Characteristic/Characterized"): This is the central ontological problem.
    *   Does the Characteristic (Heat) come to a Characterized (Fire)?
    *   If Fire is already there, it doesn't need Heat.
    *   If Fire isn't there, Heat has nowhere to land.

## Verse 5.3
**nālakṣaṇe lakṣaṇasya pravṛttir na salakṣaṇe |**
**salakṣaṇālakṣaṇābhyāṃ nāpy anyatra pravartate ||**

**Translation**:
"The function of the characteristic does not occur in the uncharacterized, nor in the characterized.
Nor does it occur elsewhere than the characterized and uncharacterized."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Impossible Landing**:
    *   *Alakṣaṇa* (Uncharacterized): A "Something" with no qualities is a logical fiction.
    *   *Salakṣaṇa* (Characterized): If it already has the quality, adding it again is redundant (*vaiyarthya*).

## Verse 5.4
**lakṣaṇāsaṃpravṛttau ca na lakṣyam upapadyate |**
**lakṣyasyānupapattau ca lakṣaṇasyāpy asaṃbhavaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"And when the function of the characteristic does not occur, the characterized is not established.
And when the characterized is not established, the arising of the characteristic is also impossible."

**Commentary**:
*   **Mutual Dependence**: They are not two things; they are one conceptual package. You can't peal the "Heat" off the "Fire" to see what's underneath.
*   **Cross-Reference**: See **Chapter 15 (*Svabhāva-parīkṣā*)**, where intrinsic nature is defined as independent. Here, the elements are shown to be dependent, thus empty of *svabhāva*.

## Verse 5.5
**tasmān na vidyate lakṣyaṃ na lakṣaṇam eva ca |**
**lakṣyalakṣaṇanirmukto naiva bhāvo 'pi vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Therefore, the characterized is not found, nor is the characteristic found.
And an entity liberated from characteristic and characterized is not found either."

**Commentary**:
*   **Ontological Collapse**: If the basic elements of the universe (Earth, Water, etc.) cannot be established as substantial entities, then the "World" built from them is like a dream.

## Verse 5.7
**ākāśaṃ labhyate naivaṃ sad asan na ca gamyate |**
**pañcānām api dhātūnāṃ eṣa eva vinirṇayaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Thus, space is not obtained; it is not understood as existent or non-existent.
This very same analysis applies to the [other] five elements."

**Commentary**:
*   **Atideśa** ("Extension"): The logic applied to Space applies to Earth (Solidity), Water (Fluidity), Fire (Heat), Wind (Motility), and Consciousness (Cognition). None have independent existence.

## Verse 5.8
**parīkṣīṇā hi ye dṛṣṭāḥ pañcadhā bhāvābhāvayoḥ |**
**ye paśyanti na paśyanti te tattvaṃ buddhaśāsane ||**

**Translation**:
"Those who see existence and non-existence in the five ways regarding those examined—
They do not see the truth in the Teaching of the Buddha."

**Commentary**:
*   **Pañcadhā** ("Five ways"): Probably refers to the five elements or the fivefold search (*pañcadhā mṛgya*).
*   **The Warning**: Reification of the elements is the root of the "Self" view. If you think the "bricks" are real, you will think the "house" (Self) is real.
