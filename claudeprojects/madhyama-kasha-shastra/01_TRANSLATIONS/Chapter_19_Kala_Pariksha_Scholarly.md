## Verse 19.1
**pratyutpanno 'nāgataś ca yady atītam apekṣya hi |**
**pratyutpanno 'nāgataś ca kāle 'tīte bhaviṣyataḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"If the present and the future depend on the past,
Then the present and the future would exist in the past time."

**Commentary**:
*   **Apekṣya** ("Depending on"): If B depends on A, B must be connected to A. If Future connects to Past, the Future must exist *at the time of* the Past. But if Future exists in the Past, it is Past.

## Verse 19.2
**pratyutpanno 'nāgataś ca na stas tatra punar yadi |**
**pratyutpanno 'nāgataś ca katham atītam apekṣya hi ||**

**Translation**:
"And if the present and the future do not exist there [in the past],
How indeed could the present and the future depend on the past?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Na stas tatra** ("Do not exist there"): If they are totally separate, how can one influence the other? A non-existent relation cannot support temporal order.

## Verse 19.3
**anayāivādhvanā gamyāv atītoparimādayaḥ |**
**na sthitir na ca gantavyaṃ na ca gantuṃ ca yujyate ||**

**Translation**:
"By this very method, the remaining two times [past/future relative to present], and [spatial concepts like] above, below, and middle are to be understood.
Static existence is not logical; nor is 'to be gone to,' nor 'going'."

**Commentary**:
*   **Atideśa** ("Extension"): The logic of mutual dependence applies to Space (*diś*) as well as Time (*kāla*). There is no absolute "Middle" without "Left" and "Right."

## Verse 19.4
**kālaś ca nāsty abhāvena kutaḥ kālo bhaviṣyati |**
**bhāvaṃ pratītya kālaś cet kālo bhāvad ṛte kutaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Time does not exist [as a separate entity]; without an entity, whence will there be time?
If time depends on an entity, where is time without an entity?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Bhāvaṃ pratītya** ("Depending on an entity"): Time is a measurement of change. Change requires a "Thing" that changes. If the "Thing" is empty (as proven in previous chapters), the "Clock" measures nothing.

## Verse 19.5
**na sthitaṃ gṛhyate kālam sthitakālo na vidyate |**
**yo gṛhītas tagṛhītaḥ kālo nāsty adhvaśo 'pi vā ||**

**Translation**:
"A static time is not grasped; and a static time is not found.
And a time that is grasped as ungrasped [changing] does not exist."

**Commentary**:
*   **Sthita/Asthita** ("Static/Dynamic"): You can't catch "Time" while it's moving (it's gone). You can't catch it when it's stopped (it's not Time).

## Verse 19.6
**yāvad bhāvam apekṣyate kālo nāma na vidyate |**
**bhāvo 'pi ca na vidyate kutaḥ kālo bhaviṣyati ||**

**Translation**:
"Insofar as time depends on an entity, [independent] time is not found.
And since an entity is also not found, whence will there be time?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Conclusion**: Time is a parasitic concept. It feeds on the reality of Objects. Since Objects are empty of *svabhāva*, Time is the "Shadow of a Phantom."
