## Verse 17.1
**ātmasaṃyamakaṃ cetaḥ parānugrāhakaṃ ca yat |**
**maitram sa dharmas tad bījam phalasya pretya ceha ca ||**

**Translation**:
"The thought which is self-restraining and beneficent to others—
That friendliness is the Dharma; that is the seed of fruit here and hereafter."

**Commentary**:
*   **Ātmasaṃyamaka** ("Self-restraining"): Refraining from unwholesome deeds.
*   **Parānugrāhaka** ("Beneficent to others"): Engaging in wholesome deeds (*kuśala*). This verse establishes the conventional validity of moral action.

---

## Verse 17.2
**cetanā cetayitvā ca karmoktaṃ paramaṛṣiṇā |**
**tasyānekavidho bhedaḥ karmaṇaḥ parikīrtitaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Karma was declared by the Supreme Sage to be volition and [action] after having willed.
Of that karma, a manifold division has been proclaimed."

**Commentary**:
*   **Cetanā** ("Volition"): Mental karma (*manaskarma*).
*   **Cetayitvā** ("Having willed"): Physical and Vocal karma (*kāyika/vācika*). Reference to *Anguttara Nikaya* 6.63.

---

## Verse 17.3
**tatra yac cetanākhyaṃ tu karma tan mānasam smṛtam |**
**cetayitvā ca yat tūktaṃ tat kāyikaṃ vācikaṃ ca ||**

**Translation**:
"There, the karma called 'volition' is known as mental.
And that called 'after having willed' is physical and vocal."

**Commentary**:
*   **Taxonomy**: Distinction between the internal intent and the external expression.

---

## Verse 17.4-5 (The Seven Dharmas)
*Verses 4 and 5 list the Abhidharma classifications (vīratī, avijñapti, etc.). Summary: Action encompasses visible restraint and invisible influence.*

---

## Verse 17.6
**tiṣṭhaty ā pākakālāc cet karma tan nityatām iyāt |**
**niruddhaṃ cen niruddhaṃ sat kiṃ phalaṃ janayiṣyati ||**

**Translation**:
"If the action remains until the time of ripening, it would attain eternality.
If it has ceased, being ceased, how will it generate a fruit?"

**Commentary**:
*   **The Central Dilemma**: Action must disappear for the fruit to arise (a seed must die to make a sprout). But if it disappears, it is non-existent. How can a non-existent thing cause a result years later?

---

## Verse 17.7-11 (The Seed Analogy)
*The opponent argues: Just as a seed produces a sprout, which produces a fruit, the mind produces a continuum (*santāna*) which produces the fruit. Therefore, destruction (*uccheda*) is avoided.*
*   **Note on Karma without Self**: The Madhyamaka solution relies on the *Continuum* (*santāna*). Just as a river flows without a single drop remaining the same, the mind-stream carries the potential for fruit without a permanent "Soul" to carry it.

---

## Verse 17.12
**yadi kṛtvā vinaṣṭaṃ tan nānuyuktaṃ bhavet phalam |**
**boddhavyaṃ pratipakṣeṇa tan manye doṣa isyate ||**

**Translation**:
"If, having acted, that [action] is destroyed, the fruit would not be connected [to the agent].
This is to be understood by the counter-position; I think a fault is desired [by you]."

**Commentary**:
*   **Counter-position**: If the Seed/Continuum analogy holds, the fruit belongs to the continuum, not the original agent. Moral responsibility becomes fuzzy.

---

## Verse 17.13-14 (The Avipraṇāśa Theory)
*The opponent proposes a new entity: The "Imperishable" (*avipraṇāśa*). It is like a promissory note (*ṛṇapatra*). The action vanishes, but it leaves an "Imperishable" mark that persists until the debt is paid.*

---

## Verse 17.15
**karma nāśena naivāsyā vipraṇāśo 'pi vidyate |**
**karmaṇāṃ cāvipraṇāśo dharmo yo buddhabhāṣitaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Even with the destruction of the action, its 'imperishable' [aspect] exists.
And the imperishability of actions is a doctrine spoken by the Buddha."

**Commentary**:
*   **Avipraṇāśa**: A theoretical construct used by the Sammitīya school to bridge the gap between action and result.

---

## Verse 17.20
**yadi svabhāvataḥ karma syān na sṛjyeta śāśvatam |**
**akṛtaṃ cābhyupetaṃ syāt karma duḥkham ca śāśvatam ||**

**Translation**:
"If action were by intrinsic nature, it would not be created [and would be] eternal.
And an unperformed action would be accepted; and action and suffering would be eternal."

**Commentary**:
*   **Refutation**: If Karma had *svabhāva*, it couldn't arise (it would be eternal). If eternal, it could never be exhausted. One would suffer forever for one sin.

---

## Verse 17.21
**karoti yadi vā karma karoty anubhavaty api |**
**anyena kṛtaṃ karma anyo 'nubhavatīti ca ||**

**Translation**:
"If he performs an action [that exists by nature], he performs it and experiences it.
[Or] the action is done by one, and another experiences it."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Dilemma**: If Karma is real (*svabhāva*), the Agent must also be real/permanent to experience it. But a permanent Agent cannot *perform* an action (change). If the Agent changes, he is "Another."

---

## Verse 17.22
**priyam apriyam eṣaiva karmaṇaḥ phalam isyate |**
**saṃskārāṇām anādīnāṃ vyavahāro na sidhyati ||**

**Translation**:
"Pleasant and unpleasant is desired as the fruit of karma.
[But if karma had nature], the convention of beginningless aggregates would not be established."

**Commentary**:
*   **Vyavahāra** ("Convention"): The entire mechanism of Samsara depends on flux. Nature (*svabhāva*) freezes flux.

---

## Verse 17.23
**na saṃbhavaḥ svabhāvasya yuktaḥ pratyayahetubhiḥ |**
**hetupratyayasaṃbhūtaḥ svabhāvaḥ kṛtako bhavet ||**

**Translation**:
"The arising of intrinsic nature from causes and conditions is not logical.
Intrinsic nature arising from causes and conditions would be something made."

**Commentary**:
*   **Recap**: Reiteration of Chapter 15. Karma arises from conditions (ignorance, craving); therefore, it has no nature.

---

## Verse 17.24
**kleśāś ca karmaṇaś caiva dehe santi na dehinām |**
**dehāś ca karmaṇaḥ kleśā yasmāt santi na dehinām ||**

**Translation**:
"Defilements and actions are not in the body, nor in the embodied ones.
Since defilements and actions do not exist, bodies do not exist."

**Commentary**:
*   **Dehin** ("Embodied One"): The Self. Since Karma and Klesha are empty, the "Owner" of the body is also empty.

---

## Verse 17.25
**kleśāś ca karmaṇaś kāyāḥ kartāraś ca phalāni ca |**
**gandharvanagarākārā marīcisvapnasaṃnibhāḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Defilements, actions, bodies, agents, and fruits—
Are like a city of Gandharvas, resembling a mirage or a dream."

**Commentary**:
*   **Gandharva-nagara** ("City of Celestial Musicians"): An optical illusion in the clouds. Karma appears solid but dissolves upon approach.

---

## Verse 17.27
**na saṃsāram utpādayanti na ca karma samudbhavanti |**
**na cāpi karmaṇā kleśāḥ kutaḥ karma bhaviṣyati ||**

**Translation**:
"They do not produce Samsara, nor do actions arise [from nature].
Nor do defilements [arise] from action; whence will action exist?"

**Commentary**:
*   **The Chain Breaks**: If no nature, no production. If no production, no Samsara.

---

## Verse 17.30
**yathā nirmitakaṃ śāstā nirmimīta maharddhikaḥ |**
**tathā nirmitakas tasya nirmimītāparaṃ punaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Just as a Teacher with great magical power might emit an illusory creation (*nirmitaka*);
And that illusory creation might emit another one again."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Grand Analogy**: The Buddha (Teacher) creates a phantom monk. The phantom monk preaches to a phantom audience. Who is acting? Who is listening?

---

## Verse 17.31
**tathā kartā kṛtaṃ karma yan nirmitakavat kṛtam |**
**yathā nirmitakenānyo nirmitas tat tatheti ca ||**

**Translation**:
"In the same way, the agent is like the [first] illusory creation; and the action done is like the [second] creation made by the illusory one."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Recursive Illusion**: The "Self" is the first illusion (created by Ignorance). This illusory Self creates "Karma" (the second illusion). We are shadows chasing shadows.

---

## Verse 17.33
**kleśāś karma ca dehāś ca kartāraś ca phalāni ca |**
**gandharvanagarākārā marīcisvapnasaṃnibhāḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Defilements, actions, bodies, agents, and fruits—
Are like a city of Gandharvas, resembling a mirage or a dream."

**Commentary**:
*   **Repetition**: The verse is repeated (from 17.25) for emphasis as the conclusion. The solidity of the moral universe is deconstructed not to destroy morality, but to show its dream-like texture.
