# Chapter 2: Looking at Coming and Going
## *When You Search for the Walker Walking*

### Blues Vernacular Translation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening

*Now friends, this second chapter is going to mess with your head a little. Nāgārjuna's about to take the most obvious thing in the world—walking from here to there—and show you ain't nothing solid in it neither. If motion falls apart under the looking-glass, everything else will too.*

---

## Part One: The Three Kinds of Space

Let me lay it out plain. When you're walking down the road, the philosophers say there's three kinds of space:

1. **Where you been** (*gata*) — the ground behind you
2. **Where you going** (*agata*) — the ground ahead of you  
3. **Where you're at** (*gamyamāna*) — the ground under your feet right now

And here's the first truth:

> *Where you been ain't being walked—  
> You already walked it, it's done.  
> Where you going ain't being walked—  
> You ain't got there yet.  
> And that space you're standing in?  
> Apart from "been" and "going,"  
> There ain't no "standing in" to find.*¹

See, the ground behind you—the walking already stopped there. Saying "it's being walked" is like saying yesterday is happening now. Can't be.

The ground ahead—no walking started there yet. Can't say "it's being walked" about somewhere your feet ain't touched.

And the ground under you? Try to find it separate from "already walked" and "not yet walked." You can't. Like trying to find the present moment between past and future—it slips right through your fingers.

## Part Two: Where's the Activity?

Now the opponent speaks up. He says:

> "Wait a minute. I see my feet moving. I see the activity right here, right now. The walking's happening in the space I'm crossing. Not behind me, not ahead—right here."²

Fair enough. Seems solid. But watch what happens when you look closer.

---

## Part Three: The Double-Walking Problem

Here's where it gets interesting:

> *How can there be walking in the "being-walked"  
> When double walking don't make sense?*³

See, to call this space "being-walked," you already used up one walking. The word *gamyamāna* (being-walked) means walking's happening there. 

Now you want to add "*and it's being walked*"?

That's two walkings. And friend, you only got one pair of feet.⁴

---

## Part Four: The Walker Who Walks

Let's try it from the other side. Maybe we can save the walker.

> *The walker don't walk—  
> The non-walker don't walk—  
> And who else is there?*⁵

Think about it:

- **The walker** is defined as "one who walks." But if he's *already* a walker, what's the "he walks" adding? He's done. The walking that made him a walker already happened.

- **The non-walker** don't walk. That's just what the word means. If he walked, he'd be a walker, not a non-walker.

- **Some third guy** who ain't a walker or non-walker? Show me where he's hiding.⁶

## Part Five: Which Came First?

Now here's the real trouble. The walker needs walking to be a walker. But walking needs a walker to happen. So which comes first?

> *Without walking, no walker.  
> Without walker, no walking.  
> So where's either one get started?*⁷

It's like asking which came first—the singer or the song? The father or the child? Each one needs the other to exist, but neither can go first.

They're leaning on each other with nothing holding them up.⁸

---

## Part Six: Where Does Walking Start?

Let me hit you with another one:

> *In the walked, you can't start walking—it's done.  
> In the not-walked, you can't start walking—it ain't begun.  
> In the being-walked... well, we just showed that falls apart.  
> So where does walking start?*⁹

You can't begin something in the past—it's over. You can't begin something in the future—it's not here. And you can't begin something in the present without the present turning into past the moment you try.

Walking ain't got nowhere to start.

---

## Part Seven: Standing Still

"Okay," someone says. "Forget walking. What about standing still?"

Same problem:

> *The goer don't stand still—  
> The non-goer don't stand still—  
> Who else is there to stand?*¹⁰

If you're a goer, you're defined by going. "He stands" takes away what made you a goer. But the non-goer—well, he wasn't going anyway, so what's he stopping?

And standing has the same problem as going. Standing needs a stander and stander needs standing. Same empty circle.¹¹

---

## Part Eight: Same or Different?

We're almost at the end. One last try:

> *Is the walker the same as the walking?  
> That don't work—you'd be saying the doer IS the deed.  
> Is the walker different from the walking?  
> That don't work neither—you'd have walking without a walker.*¹²

If they're identical, no difference between the kitchen and the cooking. But we know the cook ain't the meal.

If they're totally separate, you could find walking lying around somewhere without nobody doing it. But you never saw walking without a walker.

Not same, not different. So what are they?

---

## Part Nine: The Conclusion

After all this looking, after all this digging:

> *So the walking, the walker, and where he's going—  
> All three come up empty when you really look.*¹³

And Candrakīrti backs it up with scripture:

> *"Non-going is a term of attraction.  
> Going is a term of repulsion.  
> Where there is neither attraction nor repulsion—  
> That is the path of the noble ones."*¹⁴

## What This Means for Your Life

Now here's the Blues truth, friends.

You've been walking all your life. Walking toward something—success, love, peace, enlightenment. Walking away from something—pain, failure, your past.

And this chapter says: **look at the walking itself.**

Is there really a solid "you" doing the walking? We just showed the walker falls apart. Is there really a solid "destination"? It falls apart too. Is there really even "walking"? 

What you find is... this happening. Not-nothing, not-something. Dependent on a hundred conditions, claiming to be "my walk to my goal."

When you see that the walker has no solid core, and the destination has no solid existence, and the walking itself can't be pinned down—

You might just stop running.

Not give up. Not collapse. Just... stop the striving that comes from believing there's a solid self who has to get somewhere.

That's the peace the noble ones found. Not-going and not-not-going. Just... this.

## Endnotes

¹ **"Where you been ain't being walked"**: The Sanskrit uses three technical terms: *gata* (past/gone), *agata* (future/not-gone), *gamyamāna* (present/being-gone). The argument is that "present" can't be found apart from past and future.

² **"The opponent speaks up"**: This is probably a Sarvāstivādin Buddhist who believes all three times really exist. They say: "Activity is real, and it's located in the present space."

³ **"Double walking"**: The Sanskrit term is *dvi-gamana*—two goings. If "being-walked" already implies one walking, adding "is being walked" requires a second. But there's only one action happening.

⁴ **"You only got one pair of feet"**: Candrakīrti makes this point explicitly: double action requires double agent, but there's only one Devadatta walking.

⁵ **"Who else is there?"**: This is a trilemma—a three-way argument that covers all possibilities and finds none of them work.

⁶ **"Show me where he's hiding"**: The logic here is exhaustive: every entity is either X, not-X, or something other than both. Since "walker" and "non-walker" cover everything, there's no third option.

⁷ **"Which comes first?"**: This is *anyonyāśraya*—mutual dependence. Each term is defined by the other, but neither can exist first to ground the definition.

⁸ **"Nothing holding them up"**: This is the key insight: relations that seem solid are actually hanging in mid-air, each depending on the other with no foundation.

⁹ **"Walking ain't got nowhere to start"**: This applies to ALL activities, ALL beginnings. If beginning can't be found in past, present, or future—nothing really begins.

¹⁰ **"Standing still"**: Nāgārjuna shows that *sthiti* (standing/stopping) has the same structure as *gati* (motion). The same arguments that destroy one destroy the other.

¹¹ **"Same empty circle"**: The technical term is *prasaṅga*—showing the absurd consequences of the opponent's view.

¹² **"Same or different?"**: This is the identity-difference dilemma. It appears in many chapters and is never resolved—because there IS no third option, and yet the first two don't work.

¹³ **"All three come up empty"**: The formal conclusion: *gati* (motion), *gantṛ* (goer), and *gantavya* (destination) all lack *svabhāva* (inherent existence).

¹⁴ **"Neither attraction nor repulsion"**: This quote from the *Ākṣayamatinirdeśa-sūtra* shows that "non-going" isn't nihilism—it's the middle way between grasping and pushing away.

### Theological Notes

**For those who want the deep doctrine:**

Chapter 2 demonstrates that dependent origination applies even to motion—the most obvious and undeniable phenomenon. If motion, goer, and destination lack inherent nature, then *all* phenomena lack inherent nature.

The key method here is **temporal analysis**: past, present, and future are mutually defined and mutually exclusive. Nothing can be found that exists purely in one time-slice. This undermines the substantialist view that things have fixed, self-existing natures that persist through time.

**The connection to practice**: When you see that "I am walking toward my goal" falls apart on analysis, the grasping that drives it—the sense of a solid self with a solid destination—loosens. This isn't nihilism; it's freedom from the conceptual proliferation that causes suffering.

The Buddha walked for 45 years. But he wasn't walking like we walk—driven, grasping, believing in the solidity of walker and goal. He walked in the emptiness of walking.
