## Verse 20.1
**hetoś ca phalasya ca yadi hi saṃyogaḥ kalpate |**
**jayeta saṃyogaḥ kas tasmād dhetuphalayoḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"If the connection of cause and effect is imagined,
What kind of connection between that cause and effect is produced?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Saṃyoga** ("Connection/Contact"): The opponent claims Cause and Effect must touch to transfer energy. But "touching" implies simultaneity.

---

## Verse 20.2-4 (The Dilemma of Contact)
*If they are connected, they exist at the same time. If they exist at the same time, which is the producer? If they are separated (*viyukta*), how can the Cause influence the Effect across a gap?*

---

## Verse 20.5
**yathā ca hetuphalayoḥ saṃyogo na vidyate |**
**tathā hetuphalayor vibhāgo 'pi na vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Just as connection of cause and effect is not found,
So too, separation of cause and effect is not found."

**Commentary**:
*   **Vibhāga** ("Separation"): If totally separate, any cause could produce any effect (e.g., a mango seed producing a coconut).

---

## Verse 20.9
**nirodhe sati hetoś ca phalaṃ yady upapadyate |**
**hetur niruddhaḥ kasya syāt phalam utpadyate kadā ||**

**Translation**:
"If the fruit arises when the cause has ceased,
Whose ceased cause would it be? When does the fruit arise?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Niruddha** ("Ceased"): A ceased cause is non-existent. How can "Nothing" produce "Something"? This refutes the *Sautrāntika* view of immediate succession.

---

## Verse 20.11
**yadi saṃyuktāddhetoḥ phalam utpadyate yadi |**
**utpadyamānaṃ tad dhetor nivarteta katham punaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"If the fruit arises from a connected cause,
How could that fruit, being produced, turn back again from the cause?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Nivarteta** ("Turn back/Distinct"): If they are connected (fused), the Fruit is part of the Cause. It never emerges as a distinct entity.

---

## Verse 20.16
**hetuḥ phalasya nūnaṃ syād asataḥ katham arhati |**
**hetuḥ phalasya nūnaṃ syāt sataḥ katham arhati ||**

**Translation**:
"Certainly, if the fruit is non-existent, how is the cause capable [of producing it]?
Certainly, if the fruit is existent, how is the cause capable?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Asataḥ** ("Non-existent"): You can't produce what doesn't have the potential to exist.
*   **Sataḥ** ("Existent"): You don't need to produce what already exists.

---

## Verse 20.19
**hetuphalayoḥ saṃbandhaḥ phalasya ca na vidyate |**
**saṃbandhe sati hetoś ca phalasya ca na vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"A relation of cause and effect, and of the fruit, is not found.
When there is a relation, neither cause nor fruit is found."

**Commentary**:
*   **Saṃbandha** ("Relation"): Relation requires two distinct terms. But Cause and Effect are mutually defining. They collapse into each other.

---

## Verse 20.24
**saṃyoge cāsaṃyoge ca hetuphalayor ayuktatā |**
**parīkṣitā katham nūnaṃ sāmagrī janayiṣyati ||**

**Translation**:
"Since the illogicality of both connection and non-connection of cause and effect
Has been examined, how indeed will the 'combination' (*sāmagrī*) generate [anything]?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Sāmagrī** ("Combination/Assemblage"): The opponent's last resort—"Maybe the individual causes don't work, but the *Collection* works." Nāgārjuna replies: A collection of impotent causes is still impotent. 0 + 0 + 0 ≠ 1.
