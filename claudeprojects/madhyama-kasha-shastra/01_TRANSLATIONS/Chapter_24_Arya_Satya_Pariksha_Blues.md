**Title: "The Baby and the Bathwater"**

(Verse 1)
You say if everything is empty, there ain't no hill to climb,
(No reason for the rhythm and no reason for the rhyme)
If the world is just a shadow, you say the Truth is gone,
And there ain't no point in singin' a gospel song.

(Verse 6)
You say I’m a Nihilist, a man who don't believe,
(Tryin' to sell a hollow dream, hidin' up my sleeve)
You say I’m trashin' the Church and trashin' the Light,
Leavin' everybody stranded in the middle of the night.

(Verse 7)
But listen here, brother, you got it all wrong,
(You ain't heard the melody, you just heard the gong)
You think Emptiness means "Nothin's Really There,"
Like a man chasin' phantoms in the cold winter air.

(Verse 8)
The Boss Man told the story in two different ways,
(To help us navigate through these hazy days)
There’s the Way of the World, where we pay our dues,
And the Way of the Spirit, beyond the blues.

(Verse 10)
You can't get to the Top without the bottom stair,
(You can't get to the Heaven without the daily prayer)
Emptiness don't mean you stop doin' what’s right,
It’s the only thing that makes the candle burn so bright.

(Verse 11)
But watch out now, Emptiness is like a rattlesnake,
(One wrong move is the last one you’re gonna make)
If you grab it by the tail, thinkin' "Nothin' is Real,"
It’s gonna bite you in the heart, baby, that’s the deal.

(Verse 14)
If you understand Emptiness, the whole world is yours,
(The windows are open and so are the doors)
But if you think things are Solid, you’re locked in a cage,
Just a frozen actor on a static stage.

(Verse 15)
You’re lookin' for the horse that you already ride,
(Searchin' the world for what’s already inside)
You say my logic is bad, you say my vision is blurred,
But you’re the one who ain't heard the word.

(Verse 18)
Dependency is Emptiness, that’s the song I sing,
(Like the vibration hidin' in a guitar string)
It’s the Middle Way, baby, not too loose or too tight,
Just walkin' in the balance, walkin' in the light.

(Verse 20)
If things were Solid, you could never change,
(Everything would be permanent and mighty strange)
You’d be stuck in your sorrow, stuck in your pain,
With no hope of sunshine after the rain.
So it’s your way that kills the hope and the dream,
I’m just showin' you the water flowin' in the stream.

(Verse 21)
If your Pain was a mountain, made of solid rock,
(It wouldn't matter how loud you’d cry or knock)
It would stay there forever, a permanent scar,
Like a unreach able light from a distant star.

(Verse 31)
If the Freedom you’re seekin' was already done,
(Shinin' forever like a static sun)
You could never reach it, you could never find,
Just a treasure locked away in a frozen mind.

(Verse 36)
You think you’re defendin' the Truth and the Way,
(But you’re killin' the world with what you say)
If things don't depend on each other to be,
Then there ain't no river and there ain't no sea.

(Verse 38)
Action would be empty, effort would be dead,
(Just a bunch of useless noise in your head)
If you were born a sinner, a sinner you’d stay,
With no hope of washin' the stains away.

(Verse 40)
But if you see the Way that the world is tied,
(The knot in the middle where the Truth is hid)
You see the Heart of the Buddha, shinin' so true,
In the middle of the sorrow and the middle of you.
You see the Pain, and you see the Cure,
In the Empty Nature, shinin' so pure.
