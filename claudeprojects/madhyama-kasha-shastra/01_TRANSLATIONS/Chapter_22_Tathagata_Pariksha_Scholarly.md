## Verse 22.1
**skandhā na nānyaḥ skandhebhyo nāsmin skandhā na teṣu saḥ |**
**tathāgataḥ skandhavān na katamo 'tra tathāgataḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"He is not the aggregates, nor other than the aggregates; the aggregates are not in him, nor is he in them;
The Tathāgata does not possess the aggregates. Which one is the Tathāgata here?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Pañcadhā mṛgya** ("Five-fold Search"): The classic Madhyamaka algorithm for deconstructing the Self.
    1.  Identity (*skandhā na*): He is not the body/mind (or he would die).
    2.  Difference (*na anyaḥ*): He is not separate (or he would be inert).
    3.  Container (*na asmin*): He doesn't hold them like a bowl holds fruit.
    4.  Contained (*na teṣu*): He isn't hidden inside them.
    5.  Possessor (*skandhavān na*): He doesn't own them like a man owns a cow.

## Verse 22.2
**buddhaḥ skandhān upādāya yadi nāsti svabhāvataḥ |**
**svabhāvataś ca yo nāsti kutaḥ sa parabhāvataḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"If the Buddha, dependent on the aggregates, does not exist by intrinsic nature—
And he who does not exist by intrinsic nature, whence [can he exist] by extrinsic nature?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Upādāya** ("Dependent on"): The Buddha exists only in dependence on his form, feelings, etc. Therefore, he has no *svabhāva*. If he has no Self-nature, he cannot have Other-nature (*parabhāva*).

## Verse 22.6
**skandhān upādāya ca yo nāsti so 'sty anupādataḥ |**
**yo nāsty anupādāya ca sa bhāvo nopalabhyate ||**

**Translation**:
"He who does not exist dependent on the aggregates, does he exist without dependence?
He who does not exist without dependence, that entity is not perceived."

**Commentary**:
*   **Anupādāya** ("Without grasping/dependence"): You cannot find a "Buddha" apart from the five aggregates. There is no transcendent "Super-Buddha" floating in the void.

## Verse 22.11
**śūnyam iti na vaktavyam aśūnyam iti vā bhavet |**
**ubhayaṃ nobhayaṃ ceti prajñapty arthaṃ tu kathyate ||**

**Translation**:
" 'Empty' should not be asserted; nor should 'Non-empty' be [asserted];
'Both' and 'Neither' [should not be asserted]; but these are spoken for the purpose of designation."

**Commentary**:
*   **Prajñapty-arthaṃ** ("For the purpose of designation"): Emptiness itself is a provisional teaching (*upāya*). If we say "He is Empty," we reify Emptiness. We only say it to cure the disease of "He is Real." Once cured, we drop the medicine.

## Verse 22.12
**śāśvatāśāśvatādy atra kutaḥ śānte catuṣṭayam |**
**antānantādi cāpy atra kutaḥ śānte catuṣṭayam ||**

**Translation**:
"Eternal, non-eternal, and so forth—where is this quaternity in the Peaceful?
Finite, infinite, and so forth—where is this quaternity in the Peaceful?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Avyākṛta** ("Undetermined Questions"): These refer to the classic 14 questions (Is the world eternal? Is the soul the body? Does the Tathāgata exist after death?) which the Buddha met with silence. Nāgārjuna explains *why*: the terms (Tathāgata, World) are empty, so the predicates (Eternal, Infinite) cannot apply.
*   **Śānte** ("In the Peaceful"): In the quiescent state of Nirvana, these categories do not apply.

## Verse 22.13
**yena grāho gṛhītas tu ghano 'stīti tathāgataḥ |**
**kalpayan nirvṛte 'py asmin kalpayet so 'pi vā punaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"One who holds the grasp that 'The Tathāgata exists as a solid thing'—
That one, conceptualizing, would conceptualize him even after he has attained Nirvana."

**Commentary**:
*   **Ghana** ("Solid/Dense"): Seeing the Buddha as a concrete entity. If you think he is "real" now, you will speculate about where he "goes" after death. Both are delusions.

## Verse 22.15
**prapañcayanti ye buddhaṃ prapañcātītam avyayam |**
**te prapañcāhatāḥ sarve na paśyanti tathāgatam ||**

**Translation**:
"Those who conceptually proliferate the Buddha, who is beyond proliferation and imperishable—
All those, struck down by proliferation, do not see the Tathāgata."

**Commentary**:
*   **Na paśyanti** ("They do not see"): To see the Buddha as a physical form or a mental concept is to miss him entirely. "He who sees the Dharma sees me."

## Verse 22.16
**tathāgato yatsvabhāvas tat svabhāvam idaṃ jagat |**
**tathāgato niḥsvabhāvo niḥsvabhāvam idaṃ jagat ||**

**Translation**:
" Whatever is the intrinsic nature of the Tathāgata, that is the intrinsic nature of this world.
The Tathāgata is without intrinsic nature; this world is without intrinsic nature."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Grand Equation**: Samsara = Nirvana. The Buddha is not different from the World. Both are Empty. Because they share the same "Naturelessness," liberation is possible right here, right now.
