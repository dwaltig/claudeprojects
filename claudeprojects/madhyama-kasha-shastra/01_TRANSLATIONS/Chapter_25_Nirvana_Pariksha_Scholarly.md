## Verse 25.1
**yadi śūnyam idaṃ sarvam udayo nāsti na vyayaḥ |**
**prahāṇād vā nirodhād vā kasy nirvāṇam isyate ||**

**Translation**:
"If all this is empty, there is no arising and no passing away.
Through the abandonment of what, or the cessation of what, is Nirvana desired?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Objection**: The opponent argues that Nirvana requires the cessation (*nirodha*) of defilements. If defilements are empty (never arose), how can they cease? You can't put out a fire that never started.

## Verse 25.2
**yady aśūnyam idaṃ sarvam udayo nāsti na vyayaḥ |**
**prahāṇād vā nirodhād vā kasy nirvāṇam isyate ||**

**Translation**:
"If all this is non-empty, there is no arising and no passing away.
Through the abandonment of what, or the cessation of what, is Nirvana desired?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Counter-Objection**: Nāgārjuna flips it. If defilements had intrinsic nature (*svabhāva*), they would be permanent. You could never remove them. Only if they are empty can they be removed.

## Verse 25.3
**aprahīṇam asaṃprāptam anucchinnam aśāśvatam |**
**aniruddham anutpannam etan nirvāṇam ucyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Unabandoned, unattained, unannihilated, not eternal,
Unceased, unarisen—this is spoken of as Nirvana."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Definition**: Nirvana is not a "thing" you get or a "state" you enter. It is the quieting of the view of arising and ceasing. It is the nature of reality itself (*dharmatā*).

## Verse 25.4
**bhāvas tāvan na nirvāṇaṃ jarāmaraṇalakṣaṇam |**
**prasajyetāsti bhāvo hi na jarāmaraṇaṃ vinā ||**

**Translation**:
"Nirvana is not an entity (*bhāva*), for then it would have the characteristics of old age and death.
For an entity without old age and death does not exist."

**Commentary**:
*   **Not a Thing**: If Nirvana were a "place" or "substance," it would be subject to decay. Paradise implies a Fall.

---

## Verse 25.7
**yadi bhāvo na nirvāṇam abhāvaḥ kiṃ bhaviṣyati |**
**nirvāṇaṃ yatra bhāvo na nābhāvas tatra vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"If Nirvana is not an entity, will it be a non-entity (*abhāva*)?
Where there is no entity, there is no non-entity."

**Commentary**:
*   **Not Nothingness**: Nirvana is not just "blowing out the candle" (annihilation). "Non-entity" depends on "Entity." If Nirvana were *abhāva*, it would be dependent (*upādāya*), and thus impermanent.

---

## Verse 25.9
**ya ājavañjavībhāva upādāya pratītya vā |**
**so 'pratītyānupādāya nirvāṇam upadiśyate ||**

**Translation**:
"That which, when taken dependently or causally, is the state of coming and going (*samsara*)—
That very thing, when not taken dependently or causally, is taught to be Nirvana."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Shift**: Samsara and Nirvana are not two different things. They are the *same thing* seen in two different ways.
    *   **Seen with Grasping**: It is Samsara (birth/death).
    *   **Seen without Grasping**: It is Nirvana (peace).

## Verse 25.19
**na saṃsārasya nirvāṇāt kiṃcid asti viśeṣaṇam |**
**na nirvāṇasya saṃsārāt kiṃcid asti viśeṣaṇam ||**

**Translation**:
"There is not the slightest distinction of Samsara from Nirvana.
There is not the slightest distinction of Nirvana from Samsara."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Grand Equation**: Ontologically, they are identical because both are empty of intrinsic nature.
*   **Doctrinal Note**: This does NOT mean that "Suffering is Liberation" (Nihilism) or that "Anything goes" (Moral Relativism). It means that the *nature* of Samsara (Emptiness) is the same as the *nature* of Nirvana (Emptiness). The difference is epistemological: Delusion (*avidyā*) sees separation; Wisdom (*prajñā*) sees the non-dual reality.

## Verse 25.20
**nirvāṇasya ca yā koṭiḥ koṭiḥ saṃsaraṇasya ca |**
**na tayor antaraṃ kiṃcit susūkṣmam api vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"The limit of Nirvana is the limit of Samsara.
Between the two, not even the subtlest interval is found."

**Commentary**:
*   **No Gap**: You don't "leave" Samsara to "go" to Nirvana. You realize the nature of *where you are*. Liberation is not a journey to a distant shore; it is the recognition that the shore was never left.

## Verse 25.24
**sarvopalambhopaśamaḥ prapañcopaśamaḥ śivaḥ |**
**na kva cit kasyacit kaścid dharmo buddhena deśitaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"The calming of all objectification, the calming of conceptual proliferation, is peace.
No Dharma whatsoever was taught by the Buddha to anyone anywhere."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Silence**: Ultimately, the Buddha never spoke a word. The teachings were skillful means (*upāya*) projected by the needs of listeners, like an echo. Truth is silence.
