**Interpreter**: The Bluesman (Master John Kim)
**Status**: Blues Vernacular Interpretation

**Title: "Killin' Time"**

(Verse 1)
If Tomorrow is hidin' inside of Today,
(Waitin' for the clock to tick it away)
Then Tomorrow is already Yesterday's news,
Just a recycling bin for the same old blues.

(Verse 2)
If Tomorrow ain't connected to the days gone by,
(Float in' loose in the empty sky)
Then you can't get there from where you stand,
It’s a foreign country in a phantom land.

(Verse 3)
"Up" ain't "Up" without the "Down,"
(And the "King" ain't King without the "Clown")
You take away the Left, you lose the Right,
You take away the Day, you lose the Night.

(Verse 4)
Time is a shadow that needs a wall,
(If the wall falls down, the shadow don't fall)
It needs a "Thing" to measure, a "Thing" to age,
But there ain't no actor on this empty stage.

(Verse 5)
You can't catch the moment while it’s passin' through,
(It slips through your fingers like the mornin' dew)
And you can't catch it stoppin', 'cause it never stays still,
Just a tumbleweed rollin' down a lonely hill.

(Verse 6)
I looked at my watch, but the face was blank,
(Like a bounced check at the Memory Bank)
If there ain't no "Me" to wither and fade,
Then Time is just a ghost in the shade.
