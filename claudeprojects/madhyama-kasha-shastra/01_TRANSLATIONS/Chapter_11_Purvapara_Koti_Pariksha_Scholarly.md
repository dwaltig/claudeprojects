## Verse 11.1
**pūrvā prajñāyate koṭir nety uvāca mahāmuniḥ |**
**saṃsāro 'navarāgro hi nāsyādir nāpi paścimam ||**

**Translation**:
" 'A prior limit is not discerned'—so spoke the Great Sage.
Samsara is indeed without beginning or end; it has no beginning nor a posterior [end]."

**Commentary**:
*   **Mahāmuniḥ** ("The Great Sage"): Reference to the Buddha (specifically *Samyutta Nikaya* 15.1). Nāgārjuna cites scripture (*āgama*) to establish the premise of *anavarāgra* (without beginning or end).
*   **Koṭi** ("Limit/Edge"): The temporal boundary. If Samsara had a start, it would have a "first cause," violating dependent origination (*pratītyasamutpāda*). A first cause implies an uncaused entity, which is impossible in a system where everything arises in dependence on conditions.

## Verse 11.2
**naivāgraṃ nāvaraṃ yasya tasya madhyaṃ kuto bhavet |**
**tasmān nātropapadyante pūrvāparasahakramāḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Of that which has no beginning and no end, how could there be a middle?
Therefore, sequences of prior, posterior, and simultaneous do not logically obtain here."

**Commentary**:
*   **Madhyaṃ** ("Middle"): A middle is defined by its relation to start and finish. Without edges, the center collapses. Time itself is deconstructed.

## Verse 11.3
**pūrvam jātir yadi bhaved jarāmaraṇam uttaram |**
**nirjarāmaraṇā jātir bhavej jāteś ca saṃbhavaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"If birth were prior and old-age-and-death posterior,
Then birth would be free from old-age-and-death, and there would be an arising of [an immortal] birth."

**Commentary**:
*   **Nir-jarāmaraṇā** ("Free from aging/death"): If Birth exists as a discrete block of time *before* Death enters, then for that duration, the being is immortal. But birth *is* the onset of aging.

## Verse 11.4
**paścāj jātir yadi bhaved jarāmaraṇam āditāḥ |**
**ahetukam ajātaṃ syāj jarāmaraṇam idṛśam ||**

**Translation**:
"If birth were posterior and old-age-and-death from the beginning,
Then old-age-and-death would be uncaused and unborn; such [would be the case]."

**Commentary**:
*   **Ahetukam** ("Uncaused"): How can one die if one hasn't been born yet? Placing death first breaks the causal chain.

## Verse 11.5
**na jarāmaraṇenaiva jātiś ca saha yujyate |**
**mriyeta jāyamānaś ca syāc cāhetukatobhayoh ||**

**Translation**:
"Nor is birth logically conjoined simultaneously with old-age-and-death.
[Otherwise], one who is being born would be dying, and both would be without cause."

**Commentary**:
*   **Saha** ("Simultaneous"): If they happen at the exact same instant, they cannot act as cause and effect (which requires temporal succession). It implies a chaotic simultaneity where birth provides no support for death.

## Verse 11.6
**yatra na prabhavanty ete pūrvāparasahakramāḥ |**
**prapañcayanti tāṃ jātiṃ taj jarāmaraṇaṃ ca kim ||**

**Translation**:
"Where these sequences of prior, posterior, and simultaneous do not obtain—
Why do they conceptually proliferate [views about] that birth and that old-age-and-death?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Prapañcayanti** ("Conceptualize/Proliferate"): Despite the logical impossibility of ordering them, fools continue to build theories about "Life" and "Death" as real entities.

## Verse 11.7
**kāryaṃ ca kāraṇaṃ caiva lakṣyaṃ lakṣaṇam eva ca |**
**vedanā vedakaś caiva santy arthā ye ca kecana ||**

**Translation**:
"[The same applies to] effect and cause, and characterized and characteristic,
And feeling and the feeler, and whatever other objects exist."

**Commentary**:
*   **Atideśa** ("Extension"): This verse employs the principle of *atideśa*, extending the *anavarāgra* (beginningless) argument to all dyads. Cause/Effect, Subject/Object—none can be established as having a "first" starting point without falling into the paradoxes of priority, posteriority, or simultaneity.

## Verse 11.8
**pūrvā na vidyate koṭiḥ saṃsārasya na kevalam |**
**sarveṣām api bhāvānāṃ pūrvā koṭir na vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"A prior limit is not found, not only of Samsara;
Also of all entities, a prior limit is not found."

**Commentary**:
*   **Sarveṣām bhāvānāṃ** ("Of all entities"): The grand conclusion. Nothing has a beginning. Every phenomenon is part of an infinite web of mutual dependence without a genesis point (*ādī*).
