# Chapter 6: Desire and the One Who Wants (The Longing Blues)

## The Trouble

You walk around thinkin' you *are* that hurtin' in your heart, that you *own* that ache. Or you try to run from it, say it ain't got nothin' to do with the real you. Both them roads lead to the same lonesome crossroads at midnight. You chasin' a shadow, or you bein' chased by one.

This chapter asks the hardest question the Blues can ask: Who is the one who wants? Is the desire *you*, or is it somethin' that happens *to* you? And Nāgārjuna shows us—both answers miss the mark.

## Verse 6.1: The Man Before the Ache

**The Teaching:**
If the *man with the empty heart* was here before the *longin'* came...
Well, who would that man be? A ghost with no story, a dry river with no name.
But that can't be right. No, sir. The longin' defines the man.

**What It Means:**
If the desirous one existed independently before desire arose, then desire would have no basis or support. But a "desirous one" without desire is a meaningless concept—like calling a singer "a singer" who never sang a note.

---

## Verse 6.2: The Ache Before the Man

**The Teaching:**
Now, if the *longin'* showed up first, all dressed in pain and blue...
Tell me, whose house would it walk into? Who'd be there to feel it through?
A want without a wanter just whistles down a vacant street.

**What It Means:**
If desire existed independently before a desirous person, to whom would it belong? Desire can't stand alone—it needs someone to feel it. An ache with no heart to ache in is just silence.

---

## Verse 6.3: Together from the Start?

**The Teaching:**
They can't show up together, holdin' hands, sayin' "we begin as one."
And they can't live apart, their separate lives on the run.
Look close: you can't find where one starts and the other one is done.

**What It Means:**
Desire and the desirous cannot arise simultaneously, defining each other in a circle. Nor can they arise independently. Their apparent existence is co-dependent, with no fixed starting point—like two dancers who need each other to dance but can't say who led first.

---

## Verse 6.4: Same or Different?

**The Teaching:**
Ain't the *same*—the fire ain't the burn. 
Ain't *different*—you can't have the burn without the flame.
You try to pin down this misery, give the blues a separate name...
But the singer and the song are tangled in the very same game.

**What It Means:**
Desire is not identical to the desirous person (for then who would feel the desire?). Nor is it utterly different (for then they'd have no connection). Both logical options fail when you look close.

---

## Verse 6.5: If They Were the Same

**The Teaching:**
If the ache *was* the acher, who'd be left to feel the pain?
You'd have a hurt with nobody home, a thunderclap with no rain.
The one who longs would disappear into the longin' like a match into the flame.

**What It Means:**
If desire and the desirous one were identical, the distinction between having an emotion and being an emotion collapses. There'd be no "you" to experience the wanting—just wanting, floating free with no witness.

---

## Verse 6.6: If They Were Different

**The Teaching:**
But if they're strangers to each other, passin' ships in the night,
Then where's the connection? How does the want find the wanter right?
You'd have a lover and a love that never met, never touched, never held tight.

**What It Means:**
If truly different, desire and the desirous one would be utterly unrelated—like two strangers on opposite ends of town. But we never see desire free-floating without someone who desires.

---

## Verse 6.7: The Logical Trap

**The Teaching:**
So if they're different, the wanter could be... free of want?
A blues man with no blues? That's the lie the mind'll flaunt.
You can't have the designation without the very thing it names—
A "lover" without loving is just a word playin' games.

**What It Means:**
If difference were real, you could have a "desirous one" who has no desire—which contradicts the very definition. The label requires the quality. Pull one out, and the other collapses.

---

## Verse 6.8: Neither Works

**The Teaching:**
Neither same nor different, neither here nor there,
The longin' and the one who longs just hang suspended in the air.
You can't grab hold of either one—they're made of thinner stuff than prayer.

**What It Means:**
Both identity and difference are conceptual imputations, not features of reality. We *think* in these terms, but the thinking doesn't match what's actually there. The relation is empty.

---

## Verse 6.9: Like a Dream's Two Sides

**The Teaching:**
The wanter and the want are like the dreamer and the dream,
The seer and the seen, the river and the stream.
Neither one exists alone—they lean on each other's seam.
And when you finally see that lean... you wake up from the scheme.

**What It Means:**
Desire and the desirous one are like the apprehended and the apprehender—mutually defining, mutually empty. Neither can be found without the other. This isn't a problem to solve; it's a truth to see.

---

## Verse 6.10: The Whole Show's Like This

**The Teaching:**
And it ain't just the longin', this old familiar friend.
It's the *rage* and the *confusion*, and the heart that won't mend.
The hater and the hatred, the fool and the foolish mind...
All just empty echoes, leavin' not a trace behind.

You can't clean a mirror with a dusty, dirty rag.
See the emptiness in the feelin', and the one holdin' the bag.

**What It Means:**
This analysis applies to all afflictive states (*kleśa*)—hatred (*dveṣa*) and delusion (*moha*) along with desire (*rāga*). The one who is angry and the anger itself are likewise empty of intrinsic existence. Purification comes from seeing this, not from battling solid enemies.

---

## The Liberation

The freedom ain't in killin' the desire. It ain't in drownin' in it, either. It's in seein' the whole sad, beautiful dance for what it is: a dance. 

The longin' comes, it sings its verse. You don't have to build it a home, or wear it like a crown, or let it name you. You can let it move on through, like a train whistle in the distance. 

You are the wide, open sky that hears the sound. You were never the prisoner of that whistle. You were always the night.

## Theological Notes

| Term | Sanskrit | The Blues Reading |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **Rāga** | राग | The passion, the desire, the itch, the *Blues* itself. The specific ache for something to be other than it is. |
| **Rakta** | रक्त | The one stained by that passion, the "desirous one." The Bluesman, the lover, the sufferer—the one who seems to *have* the Blues. |
| **Kleśa** | क्लेश | The afflictions—desire, hatred, delusion. The three poisons that keep the wheel spinning. |
| **Dveṣa** | द्वेष | Hatred, aversion. The push-away. The anger that burns. |
| **Moha** | मोह | Delusion, ignorance. The fog that keeps you lost at the crossroads. |
| **The Point** | — | Nāgārjuna uses this intimate pair to demonstrate *pratītyasamutpāda* (dependent arising) and *śūnyatā* (emptiness). We search for a solid "self" who desires, or a solid "emotion" called desire. He shows both are empty of independent existence. They arise only in mutual dependence. Seeing this ends the futile war of either clinging to or suppressing desire. The path is liberation *from* the illusion of solidity, not *from* the fleeting, dream-like phenomena themselves. |
