(Verse 1)
If you built it in a factory, if you bought it in a store,
(It ain't the real thing, baby, just a plastic chore)
If it comes from a reason, if it comes from a cause,
It ain't got no Nature, it’s just obeyin' laws.

(Verse 2)
You talk about your "Nature" like it’s carved in stone,
(Sittin' independent on a golden throne)
But if you depend on water, and you depend on air,
Your "Independent Nature" just ain't there.

(Verse 3)
If you ain't got a Self, you can't have an Other,
(Can't have a stranger if you ain't got a brother)
"Other" is just "Self" seen from across the street,
Two empty shadows dancin' to the beat.

(Verse 4)
If you take away the Self, and take away the Friend,
(Where does the Beginning start, where does the Ending end?)
The world is just a stage with nobody to play,
Just a ghost town waitin' for the break of day.

(Verse 5)
If nothin' ever was, then nothin's ever gone,
(You can't lose a battle that was never on)
"Non-existence" is just a word for things that fade,
A shadow of a shadow in the cool, cool shade.

(Verse 6)
You look for the Real, you look for the Void,
(But the Truth is a place that you try to avoid)
If you say "It Is," you’re blinded by the light,
If you say "It Ain't," you’re lost in the night.

(Verse 7)
Old Man Katyāyana asked the Lord for the news,
(He said, "Lord, tell me how to shake these existential blues")
The Lord said, "Son, don't say It Is, and don't say It Ain't,
That’s the devil’s painting, and that’s the devil’s paint."

(Verse 8)
If you were born Eternal, you could never die,
(You’d be a frozen statue in a painted sky)
But Nature don't change, that’s what the wise men say,
So if you’re changin', baby, you weren't real anyway.

(Verse 9)
If you got a Nature, how you gonna turn?
(If you’re made of water, how you gonna burn?)
But if you ain't got Nature, who is turnin' round?
Just a leaf blowin' silence on the ground.

(Verse 10)
"It Is" is a trap that holds you in the past,
(Thinkin' that the good times are gonna last)
"It Ain't" is a hole where you fall right through,
Neither one is gonna save you from the blues.

(Verse 11)
So walk that tightrope, way up in the air,
(Don't look down at the darkness there)
Don't lean to the left, don't lean to the right,
Just keep on walkin' through the middle of the night.
