## Verse 12.1
**svayaṃ kṛtaṃ parakṛtaṃ dvābhyāṃ kṛtam ahetukam |**
**duḥkham ity eka icchanti tac ca kāryaṃ na yujyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Some wish [to assert] that suffering is self-made, other-made, made by both, or uncaused.
But that [assertion] as an effect is not logical."

**Commentary**:
*   **Catuṣkoṭi** ("Four Corners/Tetralemma"): The classic Indian logical apparatus used to exhaust all possible conceptual positions.
    1.  *Svayaṃ kṛta* (Self-made): Sāṃkhya view (Effect pre-exists in cause).
    2.  *Parakṛta* (Other-made): Buddhist Abhidharma/Vaiśeṣika view (Cause is external to effect).
    3.  *Dvābhyām* (Both): Jaina/Syncretic view.
    4.  *Ahetuka* (Uncaused): Cārvāka/Materialist view (Random chance).
*   **Na yujyate** ("Is not logical"): Nāgārjuna rejects all four substantialist views.

## Verse 12.2
**svayaṃ kṛtaṃ yadi bhavet prapadyeta na tat svayam |**
**skandhān imān amī skandhāḥ saṃbhavanti svayaṃ kṛtāḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"If it were self-made, then it would not arise from itself.
These aggregates arise from those [previous] aggregates; [thus] they are [conventionally] self-made."

**Commentary**:
*   **Svayaṃ kṛta** ("Self-made"): If A creates A, A must exist before A exists (infinite regress).
*   **Skandhān** ("Aggregates"): Suffering is identified with the aggregates (*upādāna-skandha*). Since present aggregates arise from past aggregates (karma), there is causal continuity, but not identity of a static "Self."

## Verse 12.3
**yady amībhyo hi skandhebhyo hy anye skandhāḥ pare yadi |**
**syāt parakṛtaṃ duḥkhaṃ parair ebhiḥ kṛtaṃ hi tat ||**

**Translation**:
"If these aggregates were distinct from those [previous] aggregates,
Then suffering would be other-made, for it would be made by those 'others'."

**Commentary**:
*   **Pare** ("Others"): If the "Past Self" and "Present Self" are totally distinct entities (like two different people), then my karma would be experienced by someone else (*akṛtābhyāgama* - experiencing results of actions one didn't do). This destroys moral responsibility.

## Verse 12.4
**svapudgalakṛtaṃ duḥkhaṃ yadi duḥkhaṃ punar vinā |**
**svapudgalena sa kaḥ syād yena duḥkhaṃ svayaṃ kṛtam ||**

**Translation**:
"If suffering were made by one's own person (*pudgala*), then without that suffering,
Who would be that own-person by whom suffering is self-made?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Pudgala** ("Person"): Distinct from *ātman* (Eternal Soul). The *pudgala* is the term used by the Pudgalavādins (Personalists) to posit a carrier of karma that is neither identical to nor different from the aggregates. Nāgārjuna treats it here as a functional agent. If this Agent exists *before* the suffering (the act/experience), what defines him as an agent? An agent is defined by action.

## Verse 12.5
**yadi puggalam utsṛjya duḥkhaṃ parakṛtaṃ bhavet |**
**duḥkhaṃ puggalam utsṛjya paras tenāpi tat kṛtam ||**

**Translation**:
"If, distinct from the person, suffering were other-made—
Then, distinct from the suffering, having discarded the person, it would be made by that 'other'."

**Commentary**:
*   **Utsṛjya** ("Having discarded/Apart from"): If the Creator (Other) exists apart from the Experiencer (Person), then suffering would float in a void, belonging to no one.

---

## Verse 12.6
**parapudgala duḥkham syād yadi kaḥ parakṛtam bhavet |**
**kena duḥkham svayaṃ kṛtam yasmāt parakṛtam bhavet ||**

**Translation**:
"If suffering were of another person, who would be the one for whom it is 'other-made'?
By whom is suffering self-made, from which it would become 'other-made'?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Paraspara-apekṣā** ("Mutual Dependence"): "Self" and "Other" are relative terms. You cannot establish "Other" without first establishing "Self." Since "Self-made" (Vs 12.2) was rejected, "Other-made" collapses.

---

## Verse 12.7
**na tāvat svakṛtaṃ duḥkhaṃ na hi tenaiva tat kṛtam |**
**paro hi duḥkhaṃ yat kuryāt tat tasya svakṛtaṃ bhavet ||**

**Translation**:
"Suffering is not self-made, for it is not made by that very same [thing].
If an 'other' were to create suffering, that would be [the other's] self-made [action]."

**Commentary**:
*   **Tenaiva tat kṛtam** ("Made by that very same"): Strict identity implies the knife cuts itself.
*   **Tasya svakṛtaṃ** ("His self-made"): If God creates my suffering, it is God's "self-made" action. So "Other-made" reduces to "Self-made" for the Other.

---

## Verse 12.8
**apekṣyāto na pūrvoktāv ubhayor na kuto bhavet |**
**na cāpy ekena kṛtaṃ dvābhyāṃ kṛtaṃ kuto bhavet ||**

**Translation**:
"Therefore, relying on the aforesaid, it is not [from either]; how could it be from both?
If it is not made by each one singly, how could it be made by both?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Dvābhyāṃ** ("By both"): Adding two impossibilities (0 + 0) does not produce a possibility (1). If Self cannot create and Other cannot create, "Both" is just a double failure.

---

## Verse 12.9
**na cāsti gaganābhāsaṃ na ca doṣaprasaṅgataḥ |**
**yadi kutaścid ākāśe duḥkham kim ahetukam ||**

**Translation**:
"Suffering does not have the appearance of the sky [eternal/uncaused], nor is it [established] through the consequence of faults.
If suffering were uncaused, would it exist anywhere in space?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Ahetukam** ("Uncaused"): If suffering had no cause, it would be eternal (like space/nirvana) or random. If random, cultivation of the Path would be useless.
*   **Doṣa-prasaṅga** ("Consequence of faults"): The fault is the rejection of the Four Noble Truths.

## Verse 12.10
**na kevalaṃ hi duḥkhasya cāturvidhyam na vidyate |**
**bāhyānām api bhāvānāṃ cāturvidhyam na vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Not only is the fourfold [origination] of suffering not found;
Also of external entities, the fourfold [origination] is not found."

**Commentary**:
*   **Bāhyānām** ("External things"): This analysis (Self, Other, Both, None) applies to pots, trees, and atoms. Nothing has intrinsic origination (*svabhāva-utpatti*).
