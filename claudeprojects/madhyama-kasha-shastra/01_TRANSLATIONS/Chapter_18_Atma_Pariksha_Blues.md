(Verse 1)
If the Soul is the Body, it dies in the grave,
(Ain't no prayer or magic that can save)
If the Soul ain't the Body, floatin' in the air,
It can't feel the hunger, can't feel the despair.

(Verse 2)
If there ain't no "Me," there ain't no "Mine,"
(No fence around the yard, no property line)
When the Owner leaves the house, the walls fall down,
Just a pile of bricks in a ghost town.

(Verse 3)
If you strut around sayin' "I ain't got no Pride,"
(Keepin' all your holiness locked up inside)
You just built a new ego, shiny and clean,
The biggest hypocrite that the world ever seen.

(Verse 4)
When "Me" and "Mine" fade like the settin' sun,
(The long war is over, the battle is done)
The grabbin' hands open, the birth-cord breaks,
No more shiverin' with the cold, cold shakes.

(Verse 5)
Freedom comes when the stories stop,
(When the needle jumps off the record shop)
The stories come from thinkin', thinkin' comes from fear,
But the Truth is silence ringin' in your ear.

(Verse 6)
The Boss Man told the sinner, "You got a Soul to save,"
He told the rich man, "It all ends in the grave,"
But to the quiet ones, he whispered low,
"It ain't Yes or No, baby, it’s just the flow."

(Verse 7)
When the thinkin' stops, the talkin' dies,
(Like a bird vanishin' in the empty skies)
Reality don't need no word, don't need no name,
It was here before the candle and here before the flame.

(Verse 8)
It’s Real, it Ain't Real, it’s Both, it’s Neither,
(Like a fever dream or a gospel believer)
Whatever gets you through the long dark night,
Whatever turns the darkness into light.

(Verse 9)
You can't learn it from a book, can't buy it in a store,
(You gotta walk through the fire to get to the door)
It’s peaceful, it’s quiet, it don't make a sound,
It’s the solid rock in the shiftin' ground.

(Verse 10)
It ain't the same river, but it ain't a new stream,
(Just wakin' up slowly from a complicated dream)
We ain't eternal, but we don't disappear,
Just changin' shapes year after year.

(Verse 12)
When the preachers are gone and the churches burn down,
(And there ain't no Bible in the whole damn town)
The Loner finds the Truth in the fallin' rain,
Walkin' by himself down the glory lane.
