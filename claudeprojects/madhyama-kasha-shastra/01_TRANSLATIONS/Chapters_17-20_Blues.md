## Chapter 17: Karma's Harvest (Karmaphala-parīkṣā)

### The Trouble
You ever plant a field in the dark? Think nobody sees? You drop a seed of meanness, a seed of sweet talk, a seed of greed… and you just walk on. But the ground remembers. The sun don't forget. One day, you're gonna come back down that same dusty road, and that field's gonna be grown over, waitin' for you. And you gotta reap every last thorn, every last bitter stalk.

### Key Verses

**17.1**
Ain't no deed done in a shadow, that the sun won't one day find.
You can whisper your evil, sweet and low, but it leaves a trail behind.
The crop springs up from that tiny seed, in a field you can't disown...
And you'll be standin' there with an empty sack, when that harvest comes home.

**17.12**
You say, "That wasn't me, I was a different man,"
But the record keeps on spinnin', plays the tune it can.
The vine you planted 'fore the war, still climbs the garden wall...
You built the prison with your own two hands, and now you hear it call.

**17.33**
But the seed ain't the tree—they ain't the same thing.
The hand that planted's long gone, but the apple's ripe for the pickin'.
No soul inside, carryin' the debt... just the pattern, the flow, the roll of the die.
Empty hands receive what empty hands let fly.

### The Liberation
The liberation ain't in runnin' from the field. It's in seein' the plow in your hands *right now*. You can't change the old seeds, but you can see the dirt today. You can plant something different. Stop plantin' thorns for tomorrow's bare feet.

## Chapter 18: THE SELF (Ātma-parīkṣā)

### The Trouble
This is the Delta crossroads of the whole thing. You been askin' all your life, "Who am I? Where am I?" You look in the mirror, you don't see nobody. You look inside, you don't find nobody either. Just thoughts thinkin' themselves. Just feelings feelin'. And that hollow space where "you" should be? That's the trouble. You keep fillin' it with names, stories, possessions, loves, hates... but the hole stays empty.

### Key Verses

**18.1 (The Central Question)**
Is the self the body, the thoughts, the pile of feelin's?
Then it comes and goes like weather—no fixed ceilin'.
But if it's *different* from all that,
Then where's it hidin'? Under what hat?

**18.6**
Neither same as the parts, nor different from the pile,
Neither ownin' 'em like cattle, nor free of 'em by a mile.
The self is a word we use for the dance,
A name for the river, not a rock in its glance.

**18.7 (The Two Truths)**
When the Buddha said "self," he was speakin' to the crowd.
When he said "no self," he was speakin' just as loud.
Both are medicine for the moment, not the final word.
The real truth's in the silence, where the question gets blurred.

**18.12 (The Culmination)**
When the racket in your head goes still,
When you stop askin' "Who's on the hill?"
No self to defend, no self to attack...
That's when you find your own way back.
Not to a place, not to a throne,
Just the wide, open sky called "home."

### The Liberation
You stop lookin' for yourself. Not because you gave up—because there was never anythin' to find. The search was the suffering. When the search stops, what's left? Just life, livin' itself. Just the blues, singin' itself. No singer needed. The song sings the singer.

### Theological Notes

| Blues Term | Sanskrit | Meaning |
|------------|----------|---------|
| The Crossroads | Ātma-parīkṣā | The central examination of self |
| The Pile | Skandha | The five aggregates we mistake for self |
| The Racket | Prapañca | Conceptual proliferation, mental noise |
| The Medicine | Upāya | Skillful means—"self" and "no-self" as tools |
| Home | Nirvāṇa | Not a place—the end of searching |

**Master John Kim's Note:**
> "This chapter ain't philosophy. It's a mirror. Stare long enough, and you see there's nobody starin' back. That's terrifying for about five seconds. Then it's the biggest relief you ever felt."

## Chapter 19: Yesterday, Today, Tomorrow (Kāla-parīkṣā)

### The Trouble
You sit up at night, grievin' what's gone. You sweat tomorrow, dreadin' what's comin'. But where *is* yesterday? Can you show me? Put your finger on it? And tomorrow—when does it arrive? The moment you touch it, it turns to today. You're chasin' ghosts, front and back.

### Key Verses

**19.1**
If the past is sittin' in the present,
Then it ain't gone, is it?
But the past is *defined* by bein' gone...
So which is it, friend? Which tune we on?

**19.4**
Tomorrow leans on today for meanin'.
Today leans back on yesterday's screenin'.
Take one away, the others fall down—
They're three drunks holdin' each other off the ground.

**19.6**
Time ain't a box that holds the world.
It's just a story we tell, unfurled.
A word for the flow, the change, the hum...
Not a place where we're comin' from.

### The Liberation
You stop livin' in yesterday's jail and tomorrow's fever. You stand in the only moment that exists—this one. Not as a philosophy, but as a release. The past can't hurt you; the future can't scare you. There's just the note you're playin' *now*.

### Theological Notes

| Blues Term | Sanskrit | Meaning |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Yesterday | Atīta | Past—defined by being gone |
| Tomorrow | Anāgata | Future—defined by not yet here |
| Now | Pratyutpanna | Present—the only "time" that exists |
| Three Drunks | Interdependence | Mutual definition, mutual emptiness |

## Chapter 20: All Together Now (Sāmagrī-parīkṣā)

### The Trouble
You see a tree fall and say, "The wind did it." But where did the wind come from? The sky's mood. And the rotten spot in the trunk? And the weight of the rain? The whole universe leaned on that tree at that moment. Nothin' happens alone. You blame the last note, but it was the whole chorus that sang the song.

### Key Verses

**20.1**
It ain't just the nail that caused the flat,
It was the road, the heat, the fact you was leanin' left.
The whole dark chorus sang that tire to death.

**20.12**
The rain don't fall 'cause the cloud said "now."
It's the ocean sighin', the sun's hard plow,
The cold hill waitin'... a million reasons why.
Nothin' in this world is born, it just arrives.

**20.24**
And the arrivin' itself? Like a dream in the mornin',
Like a city in the sky, all shimmer and warnin'.
Not solid, not fixed, just conditions alignin'...
Empty at the core, but Lord, how it's shinin'.

### The Liberation
You stop blamin' single notes and start hearin' the symphony. With that, comes a mighty compassion. You see your enemy is caught in a net of causes, same as you. You see your joy is a gift from ten thousand hands. You work with the causes, not just fight the results.

### Theological Notes

| Blues Term | Sanskrit | Meaning |
|------------|----------|---------|
| The Whole Chorus | Sāmagrī | The totality of causes |
| The Last Note | Pratyaya | The proximate condition (not the only one) |
| City in the Sky | Gandharvanagara | Mirage—beautiful, empty |
| The Symphony | Pratītyasamutpāda | Dependent origination |
