## Verse 18.1
**yadi skandhā bhaved ātmā udayavyayabhāg bhavet |**
**yady anyo bhavet skandhebhyo bhāved askandhalakṣaṇaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"If the Self were the aggregates, it would be subject to arising and passing away.
If it were other than the aggregates, it would lack the characteristics of the aggregates."

**Commentary**:
*   **Pañcadhā Mṛgya** ("The Fivefold Search"): This verse initiates the classic Madhyamaka algorithm for finding the Self, which is fully expanded in Chapter 22.1 regarding the Tathāgata.
    1.  Identity: Is Self = Aggregates? (No, because aggregates die).
    2.  Difference: Is Self ≠ Aggregates? (No, because a disembodied self cannot feel/act).
*   **Udayavyayabhāg** ("Partaking in arising/passing"): If Self = Body/Mind, then when the body dies, the Self dies (Annihilationism).
*   **Askandhalakṣaṇaḥ** ("Without aggregate characteristics"): If Self ≠ Body/Mind, it would be inert, unable to feel, think, or act. It would be a "sky-flower."

## Verse 18.2
**ātmany asati cātmīyaṃ kuta eva bhaviṣyati |**
**nirmamo nirahaṃkāraḥ śamād ātmātmanīnayoḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"And when the Self does not exist, how indeed will 'what belongs to the Self' exist?
One becomes free from 'mine' and free from 'I-making' due to the pacification of Self and what belongs to Self."

**Commentary**:
*   **Ātmanīnayoḥ** ("Of the Self and Self's property"): The collapse of the Ego (*aham*) inevitably leads to the collapse of Possessiveness (*mama*).

## Verse 18.3
**nirmamo nirahaṃkāraḥ pratīto yadi dṛśyate |**
**yo 'pi paśyati nirmamaṃ nirahaṃkāram eva ca ||**

**Translation**:
"If one who is free from 'mine' and 'I-making' is perceived [as an entity]—
He who sees [that person] sees neither the one free from 'mine' nor the one free from 'I-making'."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Trap of Arrogance** (*Tib: ñams len*): If you think, "I have destroyed the Ego," you have just created a new Ego—the "Holy Ego." True liberation is not seeing a "Liberated Person."

## Verse 18.4
**mamety aham iti kṣīṇe bahirdhā dhyātmam eva ca |**
**nirudhyata upādānaṃ tat kṣayāj janmanaḥ kṣayaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"When 'mine' and 'I' have waned, both externally and internally,
Grasping ceases; from the destruction of that [grasping], there is destruction of birth."

**Commentary**:
*   **Causal Chain**: End of I-making -> End of Grasping (*upādāna*) -> End of Becoming (*bhava*) -> End of Birth (*jāti*). This is the reversal of the Twelve Links.

## Verse 18.5
**karmakleśakṣayān mokṣaḥ karmakleśā vikalpataḥ |**
**te prapañcāt prapañcas tu śūnyatāyāṃ nirudhyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Liberation comes from the destruction of karma and defilements. Karma and defilements come from conceptualization.
Those [conceptualizations] come from mental proliferation. But proliferation ceases in Emptiness."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Path of Cessation**:
    1.  **Prapañca** (Conceptual Proliferation): The mind's tendency to reify.
    2.  **Vikalpa** (Discrimination): Splitting the world into Subject/Object.
    3.  **Kleśa/Karma** (Defilement/Action): Reacting to that split with craving/aversion.
    4.  **Mokṣa** (Liberation): The cessation of this chain. *Śūnyatā* (Emptiness) stops the *Prapañca* at the source.

## Verse 18.6
**ātmety api prajñapitam anātmety api deśitam |**
**buddhair nātmā na cānātmā kaścid ity api deśitam ||**

**Translation**:
" 'Self' has been made known; 'No-Self' has also been taught.
'Neither Self nor No-Self' has also been taught by the Buddhas."

**Commentary**:
*   **Upāya** ("Skillful Means"): The Buddha is a doctor.
    *   To the Nihilist, he taught "Self" (Responsibility).
    *   To the Eternalist, he taught "No-Self" (Impermanence).
    *   To the Wise, he taught "Neither" (Emptiness of all views).

## Verse 18.7
**nivṛttam abhidhātavyaṃ nivṛtte cittagocare |**
**anutpannāniruddhā hi nirvāṇam iva dharmatā ||**

**Translation**:
"That which is to be designated ceases when the sphere of thought ceases.
For the nature of phenomena (*dharmatā*) is like Nirvana—unborn and unceased."

**Commentary**:
*   **Citta-gocare** ("Sphere of thought"): Language (*abhidhāna*) relies on dualistic thought. When thought stops, language stops. Reality is ineffable.

## Verse 18.8
**sarvaṃ tathyaṃ na vā tathyaṃ tathyaṃ cātathyam eva ca |**
**naivātathyaṃ naiva tathyam etad buddhānuśāsanam ||**

**Translation**:
"Everything is real, or not real, or both real and not real,
Or neither not real nor real—this is the instruction of the Buddhas."

**Commentary**:
*   **Gradual Instruction**:
    1.  Real (Conventional truth).
    2.  Not Real (Ultimate analysis).
    3.  Both (Integration).
    4.  Neither (Final transcendence).

## Verse 18.9
**aparapratyayaṃ śāntaṃ prapañcair aprapañcitam |**
**nirvikalpam anānārtham etat tattvasya lakṣaṇam ||**

**Translation**:
"Not dependent on another, peaceful, not proliferated by conceptual proliferation,
Free from conceptualization, without diversity of meaning—this is the characteristic of Reality (*tattva*)."

**Commentary**:
*   **Aparapratyayam**: Known directly by oneself (gnosis), not through hearsay or logic.
*   **Śāntam**: Peaceful/Quiescent. The noise of *prapañca* has stopped.
*   **Aprapañcitam**: Not distorted by the mind's reifying tendencies.

## Verse 18.10
**pratītya yad yad bhavati na hi tāvat tad eva tat |**
**na cānyad api tat tasmān nocchinnaṃ nāpi śāśvatam ||**

**Translation**:
"Whatever arises depending on [something], that is not identical to that [cause].
Nor is that [effect] other than that [cause]. Therefore, it is neither cut off nor eternal."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Middle Way**: Identity (*tat eva*) leads to Eternalism. Difference (*anyad*) leads to Annihilationism. Dependency avoids both.

## Verse 18.12
**saṃbuddhānām anutpāde śrāvakāṇāṃ punaḥ kṣaye |**
**jñānaṃ pratyekabuddhānām asamsargāt pravartate ||**

**Translation**:
"When fully enlightened Buddhas do not arise, and when disciples too have ceased,
The wisdom of the Solitary Buddhas (*Pratyekabuddhas*) proceeds without association [teaching]."

**Commentary**:
*   **Asaṃsargāt** ("From non-association/solitude"): Even in the Dark Ages without a Teacher, the truth of Dependent Origination is accessible to those who quiet the mind. The Dharma is part of the fabric of reality, not a human invention.
