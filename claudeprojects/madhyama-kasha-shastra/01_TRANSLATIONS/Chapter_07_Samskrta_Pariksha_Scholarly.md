## Verse 7.1
**yady utpādo bhaved utpāda utpādaḥ kathaṃ bhavet |**
**atha utpādyamānasya kiṃ utpatti bhaved iti ||**

**Translation**:
"If arising itself were arisen, then arising would have another arising.
Or if [arising] is of the already-arisen, what arising could there be?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Prasannapadā**: Candrakīrti identifies the opponent as the **Sarvāstivādin**, who posits that *Utpāda* (Arising) is a real dharma that functions to make other dharmas arise.
*   **The Dilemma**: If *Utpāda* is a conditioned dharma (*saṃskṛta*), it must have the three marks (arising, abiding, ceasing). Thus, *Utpāda* must have its own *Utpāda*. This leads to **Infinite Regress** (*anavasthā*). If it *doesn't* have its own arising, it is unconditioned (*asaṃskṛta*) and cannot interact with the conditioned world.

## Verse 7.2
**utpādaḥ syād anutpanna utpannaś ca kathaṃ bhavet |**
**tadutpāda utpādyeta kiṃ tad utpādayed iti ||**

**Translation**:
"If arising were unarisen, how could it be arising?
If it were arisen, by what would it be arisen?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Anutpanna** ("Unarisen"): If arising is unarisen, it is eternal/unconditioned (like Space or Nirvana). An eternal thing cannot be a cause of a temporal event.
*   **Utpanna** ("Arisen"): If it is arisen, it requires a second Arising (*Utpāda-utpāda*). Does that second arising require a third?

## Verse 7.3
**utpādamāno hi bhavet sa na utpādaḥ kathaṃcana |**
**utpādayaty aniṣpanno yadi utpādaḥ kathaṃ bhavet ||**

**Translation**:
"If arising were [in the process of] arising, it would not be arising at all.
If an unaccomplished [arising] produces, how can it be arising?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Prasannapadā**: The opponent tries to use the present participle "arising" (*utpādamāna*) to avoid the static dilemma. Nāgārjuna replies: "A process that hasn't finished happening cannot make something else happen." You can't cook rice with a fire that is "in the process of being lit" but not yet lit.

## Verse 7.4
**utpattau triprakārāyāṃ niruddhe cāpy eṣa vidyate |**
**saṃskṛtasya ca yat spaṣṭaṃ siddhaṃ tat kiṃ na vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"The same [analysis] applies to the threefold arising, and to cessation as well.
What is clearly established for the conditioned—why is it not found?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Cross-Reference**: This anticipates **Chapter 21 (*Saṃbhava-vibhava-parīkṣā*)**, where the simultaneous presence of Arising and Cessation is refuted.
*   **Triprakārāyām** ("Threefold"): Arising from Self, Other, or Both (See **Chapter 1**).

## Verse 7.5
**sthitau yadi sthitir bhaved sthiteḥ sthitir bhavet punaḥ |**
**sā ca sthitir na sidhyeta tathā sthiteḥ sthitiḥ kathaṃ ||**

**Translation**:
"If duration had duration, there would again be duration of duration.
But that duration is not established—so how [could there be] duration of duration?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Sthiti** ("Duration/Abiding"): The Sarvāstivādin claims things endure for a moment (*kṣaṇa*). Nāgārjuna applies the same regress logic: Does the "Moment of Duration" itself endure? If yes, it needs a duration-of-duration. If no, it perishes instantly and cannot serve as a support.

## Verse 7.14
**utpādaś ca sthitiś caiva nirodhaś caiṣa lakṣaṇam |**
**lakṣyasya cānupapattiḥ syāt tribhir lakṣaṇa-lakṣitaiḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Arising, duration, and cessation are [supposed to be] the characteristics.
But if the characterized (*lakṣya*) is not established, how can there be what is characterized by these three characteristics?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Lakṣaṇa-Lakṣya** ("Characteristic/Characterized"): A characteristic (e.g., Heat) needs a substrate (e.g., Fire). If Arising is a characteristic, what is the substrate?
    *   If the substrate *exists* before Arising, it doesn't need to arise.
    *   If it *doesn't exist*, the characteristic has nowhere to land.

## Verse 7.20
**na san nāsan na sad-asan nāpy anubhayataḥ |**
**jāyate jātu kiṃcit kutaścit kasyacit kvacit ||**

**Translation**:
"Neither from an existent, nor from a non-existent, nor from both, nor from neither,
Does anything ever arise from anything, belonging to anyone, anywhere."

**Commentary**:
*   **Catuṣkoṭi**: This verse repeats the famous formula from **Chapter 1.1**, confirming that the analysis of the *Conditioned* (*saṃskṛta*) leads back to the analysis of *Conditions* (*pratyaya*). Causality itself is the target.

## Verse 7.33
**utpādasthitibhaṅgānām asiddher nāsti saṃskṛtam |**
**saṃskṛtasyāprasiddhau ca katham setsyaty asaṃskṛtam ||**

**Translation**:
"Since arising, duration, and cessation are not established, the conditioned does not exist.
And if the conditioned is not established, how will the unconditioned be established?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Saṃskṛta vs. Asaṃskṛta**: This is the crucial soteriological point.
    *   **Abhidharma View**: We escape the Conditioned (*Samsara*) to reach the Unconditioned (*Nirvana*).
    *   **Madhyamaka View**: If the Conditioned is an illusion (like a dream), you don't need to "escape" it. You just need to wake up.
    *   **Prasannapadā**: "The Unconditioned is merely the negation of the Conditioned. If the Conditioned is a hare's horn (non-existent), the Unconditioned is the 'non-existence of the hare's horn'—equally conceptual." Thus, Nirvana is also empty of *svabhāva*.

## Verse 7.34
**māyāvad gandharvanagaram vad svapnādikam yathā |**
**tathā sarve saṃskārāḥ kalpayitavyāś ca pṛthak pṛthak ||**

**Translation**:
"Like an illusion, like a city of Gandharvas, like a dream and the like—
Thus should all conditioned formations be conceived, each and every one."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Three Similes**:
    1.  **Māyā** (Illusion): It appears real but has no substance (deceptive nature).
    2.  **Gandharva-nagara** (Mirage City): It looks like a destination/refuge, but you can never enter it.
    3.  **Svapna** (Dream): It evokes real emotions (fear/desire) despite having no object.
*   **Conclusion**: Conditioned things function causally (conventionally) without having intrinsic being (ultimately).
