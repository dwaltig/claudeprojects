## Verse 16.1
**saṃskārāḥ saṃsaranti cet te nātmā sa ca nāsty ataḥ |**
**saṃskārāḥ saṃsaranti te na saccāsacca te yataḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"If compounded phenomena transmigrate, they are not the Self; and that [Self] does not exist.
Therefore, compounded phenomena do not transmigrate, for they are neither existent nor non-existent."

**Commentary**:
*   **Saṃsaranti** ("Transmigrate/Wander"): To move from one birth to another. *Saṃskāras* are momentary (*kṣaṇika*). They perish right where they arise. They cannot travel.
*   **Na ātmā** ("Not the Self"): The aggregates are not the Soul. If there is no Soul, who is wandering?

## Verse 16.2
**skandham āyatanam dhātuṃ taṃ sambandhaṃ vanaikadha |**
**vicārayan na paśyāmi duḥkhasyāntam prapadyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Examining the aggregates, sense-spheres, and elements in their connection or singly—
I do not see him who attains the end of suffering."

**Commentary**:
*   **Duḥkhasya antam** ("End of suffering"): Nirvana. If we analyze the components of a person, we find only impersonal processes. There is no "Liberated One" found among the heap.

---

## Verse 16.3
**jīvo yadi anityo 'yam saṃsaranti na yujyate |**
**svabhāvena sato nityo na hi saṃsaratīsyate ||**

**Translation**:
"If this soul (*jīva*) is impermanent, its transmigration is not logical.
For what is existent by nature as eternal is not admitted to transmigate."

**Commentary**:
*   **Jīva** ("Life-force/Soul"):
    *   If Impermanent: It dies at death. Nothing moves to the next life.
    *   If Eternal: It is immutable. It cannot suffer, change, or be reborn.

## Verse 16.4
**saṃskārāṇāṃ na nirvāṇaṃ kathaṃ cid upapadyate |**
**sattvasyāpi na nirvāṇaṃ kathaṃ cid upapadyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Nirvana of compounded phenomena is not logical in any way.
Nirvana of a living being is also not logical in any way."

**Commentary**:
*   **Saṃskārāṇāṃ** ("Of aggregates"): They naturally cease. That is not Nirvana; that is just destruction.
*   **Sattvasya** ("Of a being"): A being is a fiction. Fictions cannot be liberated.

## Verse 16.5
**na badhyante na mucyante udayavyayadharmiṇaḥ |**
**saṃskārāḥ pūrvavat sattvo badhyate na na mucyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Compounded phenomena, which have the nature of arising and passing away, are neither bound nor liberated.
Likewise, a living being is neither bound nor liberated."

**Commentary**:
*   **Conventional vs. Ultimate**: Ultimately, since things perish instantly, there is no entity that persists long enough to be bound or freed. Conventionally, we speak of bondage and liberation as designations for the continuity of suffering or its cessation.

---

## Verse 16.6
**bandhanaṃ ced upādānaṃ sopādāno na badhyate |**
**badhyate nānupādānaḥ kim avasthā ca badhyate ||**

**Translation**:
"If grasping is bondage, one who has grasping is not bound [again].
One without grasping is not bound. What state is bound?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Upādāna** ("Grasping/Fuel"): The text puns on *upādāna* as both attachment and fuel.
    *   If you already have grasping, you are *already* bound. Bondage cannot act on itself.
    *   If you have no grasping, there is nothing to bind.

## Verse 16.7
**badhnīyād bandhanaṃ kāmān bandhanāt pūrvam eva ca |**
**na baddho vidyate śeṣaṃ gatāgatam idaṃ bhavet ||**

**Translation**:
"If bondage were to bind, it would bind indeed prior to bondage.
But a bound one does not exist [prior]. The rest is like the analysis of the goer and going."

**Commentary**:
*   **Gatāgata** ("Goer/Going"): Reference to Chapter 2. Bondage needs a pre-existing "Bindable Person." But such a person is not found.

---

## Verse 16.8
**baddho na mucyate tāvad abaddho naiva mucyate |**
**syātāṃ baddhe mucyamāne yugapad bandhanamokṣaṇe ||**

**Translation**:
"A bound one is not liberated; an unbound one is certainly not liberated.
If a bound one were being liberated, bondage and liberation would exist simultaneously."

**Commentary**:
*   **Yugapad** ("Simultaneously"): To be "being liberated" implies shedding chains. While shedding, one is still partly bound. This implies the copresence of Light and Dark.

---

## Verse 16.9
**nirvāsyāmy anupādāno nirvāṇaṃ me bhaviṣyati |**
**iti yeṣāṃ grahas teṣām upādānamahāgrahaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
" 'I will pass into Nirvana without grasping; Nirvana will be mine'—
Those who have such a grasp, theirs is a great grasping at grasping."

**Commentary**:
*   **Upādāna-mahāgrahaḥ** ("Great grasping at grasping"): The spiritual ego. Desiring Nirvana creates a self ("I will pass") and an object ("Nirvana"). This duality is the root of Samsara.

---

## Verse 16.10
**na nirvāṇasamāropo na saṃsārāpakarṣaṇam |**
**yatra kastatra saṃsāro nirvāṇaṃ kiṃ vikalpyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Where there is no superimposition of Nirvana nor removal of Samsara—
What is Samsara there? What is discriminated as Nirvana?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Samāropa/Apakarṣaṇa** ("Projection/Removal"): We don't need to "add" Nirvana or "subtract" Samsara. We just need to stop conceptualizing them as two real, opposed places.
*   **Samsara = Nirvana**: This anticipates the famous declaration in Chapter 25.19. Nirvana is not a different place; it is the reality of Samsara seen without delusion.
