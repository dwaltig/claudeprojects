**Title: "Same Old Town"**

(Verse 1)
You packin' your bags for the Promised Land,
(Lookin' for a place where the mountains stand)
You say, "I gotta leave this world of pain,"
Tryin' to outrun the fallin' rain.

(Verse 3)
But Heaven ain't a place you can buy a ticket to,
(It ain't in the sky, and it ain't in the blue)
It ain't something you get, it ain't something you lose,
It’s just the quiet that comes after the blues.

(Verse 4)
If Heaven was a Thing, it would rot and rust,
(Turning all your diamonds back into dust)
If it was Real like a rock or a stone,
You’d still be sittin' on a dyin' throne.

(Verse 7)
And it ain't just Nothin', like a hole in the floor,
(You can't walk through a non-existent door)
If you blow out the flame, where does it go?
That’s a secret that only the ashes know.

(Verse 9)
Samsara is a wheel spinnin' round and round,
(Grindin' your bones into the hard, cold ground)
But if you stop tryin' to grab the wheel,
The spinnin' stops, and the wound can heal.

(Verse 19)
I looked at the Devil, and I looked at the Lord,
(One had a smile, and one had a sword)
But when I looked closer, beneath the mask,
They were the same face, performing the same task.

(Verse 20)
The Jailhouse and the Garden are the same damn place,
(Just depends on the look on your face)
There ain't no fence between the Here and the There,
Just a imaginary line in the empty air.

(Verse 24)
I stopped talkin' 'cause there ain't nothin' to say,
(The words just get in the glorious way)
The Buddha never preached, he never said a word,
Just the sound of the wind and the call of a bird.
Peace is the silence when the noise is done,
Two shadows mergin' in the settin' sun.
