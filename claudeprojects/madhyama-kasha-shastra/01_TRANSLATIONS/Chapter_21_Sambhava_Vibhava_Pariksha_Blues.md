**Title: "Rise and Fall"**

(Verse 1)
You can't have the Good Times without the Bad,
(Can't lose the money that you never had)
If the Rise and Fall are holdin' hands,
It’s a shaky foundation on shiftin' sands.

(Verse 2)
If you try to die before you’re born,
(Like a midnight shadow in the early morn)
You’re puttin' the cart before the mule,
Breakin' every single natural rule.

(Verse 3)
But if you try to live while you’re dyin' too,
(Wearin' one old sock and one new shoe)
The Life and the Death fight for the space,
Like two runners in a single lane race.

(Verse 4)
Nothing stays steady, nothing stays still,
(Water runnin' down the side of the hill)
If you think you’re livin' without the decay,
You’re just a fool dreamin' the day away.

(Verse 6)
They ain't together and they ain't apart,
(Like a crack runnin' through a broken heart)
Birth and Death are a package deal,
Two sides spinnin' on the same old wheel.

(Verse 11)
You say, "I see the baby, then I see the grave,"
(Like a calm ocean before the wave)
But if the baby is safe from the dyin' day,
He’d be a stone statue that could never play.

(Verse 13)
You say, "It’s all over, the lights are out,"
(Livin' in the shadow of a heavy doubt)
But you can't turn off what was never on,
You can't see the sunset without the dawn.

(Verse 17)
Is the man in the coffin the man in the crib?
(Or is it just a story, is it just a fib?)
If he’s the same, then he didn't change,
If he’s different, Lord, it’s mighty strange.

(Verse 21)
I looked at my soul in the mirror glass,
(Watchin' the seasons come and pass)
I ain't born, and I ain't dead,
Just a ghostly song in a worryin' head.
