## Introduction

The opponent argues: Even though motion has been refuted, the senses (seeing, hearing, etc.) are established on the authority of scripture. As stated in the Abhidharma:

> *"Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and mind—*  
> *These are the six sense-faculties;*  
> *The visible and so forth are their domains."*

Therefore, the senses exist by their own nature. Nāgārjuna responds: They do not exist [with inherent nature].

## Verse 3.1
**darśanaṃ śravaṇaṃ ghrāṇaṃ rasanaṃ sparśanaṃ manaḥ |**
**indriyāṇi ṣaḍ eteṣāṃ draṣṭavyādīni gocaraḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and mind—
These are the six sense-faculties. The visible and so forth are their domains."

**Commentary**:
*   **Indriya** ("Sense-faculty"): From root *ind* (to rule). The eye "rules" the domain of color/form.
*   **Gocara** ("Domain"): Literally "cow-pasture." The range within which the sense operates.

## Verse 3.2
**svam ātmānaṃ darśanaṃ hi tat tad eva na paśyati |**
**na paśyati yad ātmānaṃ kathaṃ drakṣyati tat parān ||**

**Translation**:
"That very seeing does not see itself—its own self it does not see.
What does not see itself—how will it see others?"

**Commentary**:
*   **The Reflexivity Problem**: If seeing (*darśana*) is an agent that performs an action, it must be able to perform that action on itself to be self-established. Just as a finger cannot touch its own tip, the eye cannot see itself.
*   **Cross-Reference**: This argument anticipates **Chapter 9 (*Pūrva-parīkṣā*)**, which refutes the existence of a "Seer" prior to seeing.

## Verse 3.3
**na paryāpto 'gnidṛṣṭānto darśanasya prasiddhaye |**
**sa darśanena saḥ proktaḥ gamyamānagātāgataih ||**

**Translation**:
"The fire analogy is not adequate to establish seeing.
That [fire], together with seeing, is refuted by [the analysis of] the being-traversed, traversed, and not-yet-traversed."

**Commentary**:
*   **Agni-dṛṣṭānta** ("Fire Analogy"): The opponent argues: "Fire burns others without burning itself; so the eye sees others without seeing itself."
*   **Refutation**: Fire is refuted by the same logic used for Motion in Chapter 2. A burning fire burns neither the burnt, nor the unburnt, nor the being-burnt.
*   **Cross-Reference**: See also **Chapter 10 (*Agnīndhana-parīkṣā*)** for the detailed deconstruction of Fire and Fuel.

## Verse 3.4
**nāpaśyamānaṃ bhavati yadā kiṃcana darśanam |**
**darśanaṃ paśyatīty evaṃ katham etat tu yujyate ||**

**Translation**:
"When seeing is not seeing anything, [it is said] 'seeing sees'—
How is this appropriate?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Action requires an Object**: "Seeing" is a transitive verb. If there is no object, there is no seeing. A "potential" to see is just a mental abstraction.

---

## Verse 3.5
**vyākhyāto darśaneneva draṣṭā cāpy upagamyatām ||**

**Translation**:
"Just as seeing has been explained, so too the seer should be understood [as refuted]."

**Commentary**:
*   **Atideśa** ("Extension"): The logic moves from the Faculty (*Indriya*) to the Agent (*Kartṛ*). If the instrument fails, the user of the instrument cannot be established.

## Verse 3.6
**tiraskṛtya draṣṭā nāsty atiraskṛtya ca darśanam |**
**draṣṭavyaṃ darśanaṃ caiva draṣṭary asati te kutaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Without [seeing] the seer does not exist, and with [seeing excluded] also not.
The seen and seeing—in the absence of the seer, from where [would they come]?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Mutual Dependence**: Seer and Seeing are mutually dependent (*paraspara-apekṣā*). Neither can serve as the foundation for the other.
*   **Cross-Reference**: See **Chapter 14 (*Saṃsarga-parīkṣā*)** on why mutually dependent terms cannot meet or associate.

## Verse 3.7
**pratītya mātāpitarau yathoktaḥ putrasaṃbhavaḥ |**
**cakṣū rūpe pratītyaivaṃ uktā vijñānasaṃbhavaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Just as the arising of a son is spoken of depending on mother and father,
So the arising of consciousness is spoken of depending on eye and form."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Metaphor**: Father/Mother/Son = Eye/Form/Consciousness. Just as a "Father" is not a father without a son, the "Eye" is not an eye without consciousness.

---

## Verse 3.8
**draṣṭavyadarśanābhāvād vijñānādicatuṣṭayam |**
**nāstīti upādānādīni bhaviṣyanti punaḥ katham ||**

**Translation**:
"In the absence of the seen and seeing, the fourfold [set of] consciousness and so forth does not exist.
So how will grasping and the rest come to be?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Catuṣṭayam** ("Fourfold"): Consciousness, Contact, Feeling, Craving.
*   **Soteriological Impact**: If the sensory input is empty, the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination (Chapter 26) do not gain traction. There is no foothold for grasping.

## Verse 3.9
**vyākhyātaṃ śravaṇaṃ ghrāṇaṃ rasanaṃ sparśanaṃ manaḥ |**
**darśaneneva jānīyac chrotṛ śrotavyakādi ca ||**

**Translation**:
"Hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and mind are explained [the same way].
Just as with seeing, so should one understand the hearer, the heard, and so forth."

**Commentary**:
*   **Conclusion**: The deconstruction of Vision applies to all six senses. The entire sensorium is empty of intrinsic nature.
