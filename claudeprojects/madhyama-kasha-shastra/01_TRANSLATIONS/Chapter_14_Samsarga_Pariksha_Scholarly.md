## Verse 14.1
**draṣṭavyaṃ darśanaṃ draṣṭā trīṇy etāni dviśo dviśaḥ |**
**sarvaśaś ca na saṃsargaṃ anyonyena vrajanty uta ||**

**Translation**:
"The object to be seen, the seeing, and the seer—these three—
Do not enter into association with one another, either in pairs or all together."

**Commentary**:
*   **Dviśo dviśaḥ** ("Two by two"): Pairwise contact (Seer + Seen).
*   **Sarvaśaḥ** ("All together"): Simultaneous contact of the triad.
*   **Na saṃsargaṃ** ("No association"): Association requires two distinct entities meeting. Nāgārjuna will prove distinctness is impossible.

## Verse 14.2
**evaṃ rāgaś ca raktaś ca rañjanīyaṃ ca dṛśyatām |**
**traidhā traidhā ca sarveṣu kleśeṣv āyatanādiṣu ||**

**Translation**:
"In the same way, passion, the impassioned one, and the object of passion should be viewed.
And the three-fold [analysis applies] to all defilements and sense-spheres."

**Commentary**:
*   **Atideśa** ("Extension"): The logic applies to *Rāga* (Passion/Subject/Object), *Dveṣa* (Aversion), and *Moha* (Delusion). No defilement "touches" the mind because they are not distinct entities waiting to collide.

## Verse 14.3
**anyenānyasya saṃsargas tac cānyatvaṃ na vidyate |**
**draṣṭavyaprabhṛtīnāṃ yan na saṃsargam vrajanty ataḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Association is of one 'other' with another 'other'; but that 'otherness' is not found.
Therefore, the object to be seen and the rest do not enter into association."

**Commentary**:
*   **Anyatva** ("Otherness/Difference"): Crucial definition. For A to associate with B, A must be "other" than B. But if A and B are mutually dependent (Seer depends on Seen), they lack intrinsic "otherness."

## Verse 14.4
**na ca kevalam anyasya saṃsargo nāsti kasya cit |**
**kasyacit kena cit sārdhaṃ saṃsargaḥ kūṭa yujyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Not only does the 'other' not have association with anything;
[But] how can the association of anything with anything be logical?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Kūṭa yujyate** ("How is it logical?"): If "Otherness" fails, "Association" fails. If things are not "Other," they are "Same" or "Non-existent." The Same cannot associate (identity). The Non-existent cannot associate.

## Verse 14.5
**anyad anyat pratītyānyan nānyad anyad ṛte 'nyataḥ |**
**yat pratītya ca yat tasmāt tad anyan nopapadyate ||**

**Translation**:
"An 'other' is 'other' dependent on an 'other'; an 'other' is not 'other' without an 'other.'
And that which depends on something—from that, it does not arise as 'other'."

**Commentary**:
*   **Pratītya** ("Dependent on"): "Short" depends on "Long." "Short" has no intrinsic nature of its own. Therefore, "Short" is not intrinsically "Other" than "Long"—it is bound to it. Dependency negates separateness.

## Verse 14.6
**yady anyad anyad anyasmād anyasmād apy ṛte bhavet |**
**tad anyad anyad anyasmād ṛte nāsti ca nāsty ataḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"If an 'other' were 'other' [distinct] from an 'other,' it would exist even without that 'other.'
But an 'other' does not exist without an 'other'; therefore, it does not exist."

**Commentary**:
*   **Ṛte bhavet** ("Would exist without"): If "Left" were intrinsically "Left," it would remain "Left" even if you removed "Right." But without "Right," "Left" vanishes. Thus, true "Otherness" is impossible.

## Verse 14.7
**nānyasmin vidyate 'nyatvaṃ nananyasmin na cāsyate |**
**avidyamāne cānyatve kuto 'nyad upapadyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Otherness is not found in the 'other,' nor is it found in the 'non-other.'
And when 'otherness' does not exist, where does the 'other' obtain?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Anyasmin** ("In the other"): Otherness cannot reside in the Other (circularity). Nor in the Non-Other (contradiction). Since Difference is unestablished, Association (which presupposes Difference) is impossible.

## Verse 14.8
**na tena tasya saṃsargo nānyenānyasya yujyate |**
**saṃsrijyamānaṃ saṃsṛṣṭaṃ saṃsraṣṭā ca na vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"There is no association of this with that; nor is there [association] of the other with the other.
The associating, the associated, and the associator are not found."

**Commentary**:
*   **Na vidyate** ("Are not found"): Conclusion. The triad of interaction (Agent, Action, Object) collapses because the primary condition for interaction—Distinction—is absent.
