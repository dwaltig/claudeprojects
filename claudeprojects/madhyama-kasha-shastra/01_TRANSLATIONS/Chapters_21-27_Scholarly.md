# Chapters 21-27: Scholarly Translations (FINAL BATCH)

## Chapter 21: Saṃbhavavibhava-parīkṣā (Examination of Arising and Passing)

### Introduction
A foundational deconstruction of the very concepts of production, destruction, and the enduring entity (*bhāva*) presumed to undergo them. It questions the logical coherence of origination *ab nihilo* and annihilation *ad nihilum*.

### Key Verses Summarized
- **v.1-6:** Examines whether arising and perishing can coherently apply to existent or non-existent things
- **v.12-14:** Neither identity nor difference can characterize the relation between an entity and its arising/passing
- **v.21:** Conclusion: arising and passing, like all phenomena, are empty and dependently designated

### Core Argument
- An entity cannot arise from itself (redundant) or from what is other (unrelated)
- Passing-away cannot be attributed to what exists (it would cease to exist) or what doesn't (nothing to pass)
- The very categories of "arising" and "passing" presuppose inherent existence, which is refuted

### Key Terms

| Sanskrit | English | Note |
|----------|---------|------|
| **Saṃbhava** | Arising, production | Coming into being |
| **Vibhava** | Destruction, passing | Going out of being |
| **Bhāva** | Entity, existent | That which undergoes change |

## Chapter 22: Tathāgata-parīkṣā (Examination of the Tathāgata)

### Introduction
This chapter applies the identity/difference analysis to the Buddha himself. If even the Tathāgata cannot be found as inherently existent, then certainly no ordinary being can claim such status.

### Key Verses Summarized
- **v.1:** The Tathāgata is not the aggregates, not other than them, not their possessor
- **v.11-12:** After death, the Tathāgata is neither existent nor non-existent nor both nor neither
- **v.16:** The emptiness of the Tathāgata is the emptiness of the world; the limit of one is the limit of the other

### Core Argument
- The Buddha cannot be identified with or separated from the five aggregates
- This parallels Chapter 18's analysis of the ordinary self
- The unanswerable questions about the Buddha's post-mortem status demonstrate the limits of conceptual thought

### Key Terms

| Sanskrit | English | Note |
|----------|---------|------|
| **Tathāgata** | "Thus-gone" | The Buddha; the one who has attained enlightenment |
| **Catuskoṭi** | Tetralemma | Applied to the Buddha's status after death |

## Chapter 23: Viparyāsa-parīkṣā (Examination of Error)

### Introduction
An analysis of the four inversions (*viparyāsa*): mistaking what is impermanent for permanent, suffering for happiness, impure for pure, and non-self for self.

### Key Verses Summarized
- **v.1-8:** The inversions are analyzed as empty—if suffering is empty, what is mistaken for happiness?
- **v.20-25:** The purification of inversions is not the replacement of wrong views with right ones, but the cessation of all reifying views

### Core Argument
- The four inversions depend on there being real referents to be mistaken about
- Since the referents (permanence, happiness, purity, self) are themselves empty, the "inversions" are also empty
- Liberation is not acquiring correct views but ceasing all conceptual distortion

### Key Terms

| Sanskrit | English | Note |
|----------|---------|------|
| **Viparyāsa** | Inversion, perversion | Cognitive distortion |
| **Anitya/Nitya** | Impermanent/Permanent | First inversion pair |
| **Duḥkha/Sukha** | Suffering/Happiness | Second pair |
| **Anātman/Ātman** | Non-self/Self | Fourth pair |

## Chapter 24: Āryasatya-parīkṣā (Examination of Noble Truths)

### THE GRAND SYNTHESIS

### Introduction
**The philosophical climax of the entire treatise.** The opponent charges that if all is empty, the Four Noble Truths, the Path, the Sangha, and Buddhism itself would be impossible. Nāgārjuna turns the tables: it is *only because* things are empty that suffering, its cause, its cessation, and the path are possible.

### Key Verses

**MMK 24.1-6 (The Opponent's Objection):**
"If all this is empty, there is neither arising nor passing away. It follows that the Four Noble Truths do not exist."

**MMK 24.7 (Nāgārjuna's Counter):**
"We say that you do not understand the purpose of emptiness, emptiness itself, or the meaning of emptiness. Therefore you are harmed by it."

**MMK 24.14:**
"For whom emptiness is possible, everything is possible. For whom emptiness is not possible, nothing is possible."

**MMK 24.18 (THE FAMOUS VERSE):**
> *yaḥ pratītyasamutpādaḥ śūnyatāṃ tāṃ pracakṣmahe |*
> *sā prajñaptir upādāya pratipat saiva madhyamā ||*

**Translation:**
"Whatever is dependently arisen, that we declare to be emptiness. That, being a dependent designation, is itself the Middle Way."

**MMK 24.40:**
"Therefore, a single dharma that is not empty is not found. Therefore, a single dharma that is not dependent is not found. For this reason there is no dharma that is not the Middle Way."

### Core Argument
1. **Emptiness enables, not destroys:** If things had inherent existence, they could never change—suffering would be eternal, the path would be useless.
2. **Dependent origination = Emptiness = Middle Way:** These three are coextensive. To understand one is to understand all.
3. **Two Truths preserved:** Conventional truths (suffering, path, liberation) remain valid within their domain; ultimate truth reveals their empty nature without negating their function.

### Key Terms

| Sanskrit | English | Note |
|----------|---------|------|
| **Catvāry āryasatyāni** | Four Noble Truths | Suffering, origin, cessation, path |
| **Pratītyasamutpāda** | Dependent origination | = Emptiness = Middle Way |
| **Śūnyatā** | Emptiness | Not nihilism; the absence of inherent existence |
| **Madhyamā pratipad** | Middle Way | Between eternalism and nihilism |
| **Prajñapti upādāya** | Dependent designation | Conventional naming based on conditions |

## Chapter 25: Nirvāṇa-parīkṣā (Examination of Nirvāṇa)

### THE CULMINATION

### Introduction
The opponent asks: if all is empty, what is *nirvāṇa*? Is it existence or non-existence? Nāgārjuna's answer is the most radical equation in Buddhist philosophy: **the limits of *nirvāṇa* are the limits of *saṃsāra***—they are not two separate realms.

### Key Verses

**MMK 25.3:**
"What is never abandoned, never acquired, never annihilated, never made permanent, never ceased, never arisen—this is called *nirvāṇa*."

**MMK 25.9:**
"That which, taken as causal or as dependent upon a cause, is the process of being born and passing on—that, taken non-causally and without dependence, is declared to be *nirvāṇa*."

**MMK 25.19-20 (The Climactic Equation):**
> "There is no distinction whatsoever between *saṃsāra* and *nirvāṇa*. There is no distinction whatsoever between *nirvāṇa* and *saṃsāra*. The limit of *nirvāṇa* is the limit of *saṃsāra*. There is not the slightest difference between the two."

**MMK 25.24:**
"The pacification of all apprehending, the pacification of *prapañca*—no dharma whatsoever was ever taught by the Buddha to anyone whatsoever."

### Core Argument
1. ***Nirvāṇa* is not a place, state, or thing:** It cannot be characterized by the tetralemma (existence/non-existence/both/neither).
2. ***Nirvāṇa* = *saṃsāra* correctly perceived:** The difference is epistemic, not ontological. When the veil of ignorance lifts, what was *saṃsāra* is seen as it always was: empty, peaceful, *nirvāṇa*.
3. **The Buddha's "teaching" is ultimately silence:** No dharma was ever taught because there is no inherently existent teaching, teacher, or taught.

### Key Terms

| Sanskrit | English | Note |
|----------|---------|------|
| **Nirvāṇa** | Extinction, liberation | Not a thing; the end of reification |
| **Saṃsāra** | Cyclic existence | Not fundamentally different from nirvāṇa |
| **Prapañca** | Conceptual proliferation | What is pacified in nirvāṇa |
| **Upādāna** | Grasping, fuel | What sustains saṃsāra |

## Chapter 26: Dvādaśāṅga-parīkṣā (Examination of Twelve Links)

### Introduction
A brief application of emptiness to the twelve-fold chain of dependent origination (*pratītyasamutpāda*), the Buddha's core teaching on the causal structure of suffering.

### Key Verses Summarized
- **v.1-9:** Each link (ignorance → formations → consciousness → ... → aging-and-death) is examined as empty
- **v.10:** "Through the complete cessation of this and that, this and that will not come to be. The entire mass of suffering is thus completely ceased."
- **v.12:** Ignorance (*avidyā*) is the root; its cessation through wisdom (*prajñā*) unravels the entire chain

### Core Argument
- The links are not intrinsically real causal entities but empty, interdependent processes
- Ignorance is the misconception of inherent existence
- Its cessation through wisdom unravels the entire chain, demonstrating the path to liberation within an empty framework

### Key Terms

| Sanskrit | English | Note |
|----------|---------|------|
| **Dvādaśāṅga** | Twelve limbs/links | The chain of dependent origination |
| **Avidyā** | Ignorance | The first link; root of suffering |
| **Jarāmaraṇa** | Aging-and-death | The twelfth link; the culmination of suffering |

## Chapter 27: Dṛṣṭi-parīkṣā (Examination of Views)

### THE FINAL CHAPTER

### Introduction
A systematic refutation of all fixed views (*dṛṣṭi*) about the past and future, especially concerning the self and the world. The treatise concludes not with a new view but with the pacification of all conceptual grasping.

### Key Verses Summarized
- **v.1-15:** Examines and refutes 14 standard metaphysical views (world eternal/not-eternal, self same as body/different, etc.)
- **v.29:** "Because the Buddhas have taught the abandonment of all views about 'I' and 'mine,' those who still have views about 'I' and 'mine' are not taught [the highest teaching]."
- **v.30:** "For the one for whom emptiness is possible, all things are possible. For the one for whom emptiness is not possible, nothing is possible."

### Core Argument
- All metaphysical views are products of reifying the aggregates
- These views are not merely false; they are incoherent, presupposing inherently existent subjects and objects
- The ultimate wisdom is the relinquishment of all views, grounded in the direct realization of emptiness

### Key Terms

| Sanskrit | English | Note |
|----------|---------|------|
| **Dṛṣṭi** | View, opinion | The conceptual positions being refuted |
| **Śāśvatavāda** | Eternalism | The view that things are permanent |
| **Ucchedavāda** | Annihilationism | The view that things are utterly destroyed |
| **Antagrāha** | Grasping to extremes | The root error behind all views |

## Concluding Note

The *Mūlamadhyamakakārikā* ends not with a positive doctrine but with silence—the silence of conceptual peace (*prapañcopaśama*). Emptiness is not a new metaphysics but a therapy that dissolves all metaphysical grasping. The 27 chapters systematically deconstruct every category of experience until nothing remains to cling to. This is not nihilism; it is the Middle Way—the only coherent basis for conventional truth, ethical action, and liberation.
