### Candrakīrti's Opening Invocation

*Verses 1-4: Homage to Mañjuśrī and Nāgārjuna*

> To Mañjuśrī, the youthful prince, I bow—  
> He who, his dwelling purified from clinging to extremes,¹  
> Born from the ocean of the Perfectly Awakened One,  
> With compassion taught the profound nature of the true Dharma waters.²

> Up to this day, the rays of his vision  
> Burn the fuel of rival doctrines—  
> And also burn the darkness in the minds  
> Of beings in this world.³

> His flood of words of incomparable wisdom  
> Sweeps away the entire army of cyclic existence,⁴  
> Bringing to trainable beings, together with the gods,  
> The royal splendor of the three realms.

> Having bowed to that Nāgārjuna,  
> I shall compose a commentary on his verses—  
> The *Prasannapadā* ("Clear Words"), joined with easy explanation,  
> Undisturbed by the winds of logic.⁵

## Preface to the Text

Candrakīrti explains the *sambandha* (connection), *abhidheya* (subject matter), and *prayojana* (purpose) of the treatise:

**Subject Matter** (*abhidheya*): Dependent origination (*pratītyasamutpāda*) characterized by the eight negations—non-cessation, non-arising, non-annihilation, non-permanence, not-one-meaning, not-different-meanings, non-coming, and non-going.⁶

**Purpose** (*prayojana*): Nirvāṇa, characterized by the pacification of all conceptual proliferation (*sarva-prapañcopashama*).⁷

## Kārikā 1-2: The Dedication Verses

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> anirodham anutpādam anucchedam aśāśvatam |  
> anekārtham anānārtham anāgamam anirgamam ||1||  
>
> yaḥ pratītyasamutpādaṃ prapañcopaśamaṃ śivam |  
> deśayāmāsa saṃbuddhas taṃ vande vadatāṃ varam ||2||

### Translation:

> **[1]** Neither ceasing nor arising,⁸  
> Neither annihilated nor permanent,  
> Neither one in meaning nor different in meaning,  
> Neither coming nor going—

> **[2]** He who taught dependent origination,  
> The pacification of proliferation, the auspicious—  
> That fully awakened one, the best of speakers,  
> Him I venerate.⁹

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

Candrakīrti notes that cessation (*nirodha*) is mentioned before arising (*utpāda*) to demonstrate that there is no fixed order—it is not the case that arising must come first and cessation later. As he will state: "If there were birth first, then decay and death later, birth would be without aging and death—one would be born immortal!"¹⁰

The eight negations are applied to dependent origination to show its true nature as perceived by noble beings (*ārya*). These negations refute the eight corresponding wrong views.

## Kārikā 3: The Tetralemma (Catuṣkoṭi)

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> na svato nāpi parato na dvābhyāṃ nāpy ahetutaḥ |  
> utpannā jātu vidyante bhāvāḥ kvacana kecana ||3||

### Translation:

> **[3]** Not from self, not from other,  
> Not from both, and not without cause—  
> Never anywhere are there  
> Any entities that have arisen.¹¹

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

This verse refutes the four possible modes of arising, directed at four opponent schools:¹²

| Position | Sanskrit | Proponent |
|:---------|:---------|:----------|
| From self (*svataḥ*) | स्वतः | Sāṃkhya |
| From other (*parataḥ*) | परतः | Naiyāyika, Buddhist realists |
| From both (*dvābhyām*) | द्वाभ्याम् | Jaina |
| Without cause (*ahetukaḥ*) | अहेतुकः | Cārvāka/Lokāyata |

Candrakīrti cites Ācārya Buddhapālita's commentary: "Entities do not arise from themselves because:
1. Their arising would be purposeless (*vaiyarthya*)—if they already exist, why arise again?
2. There would be infinite regress—if what exists arises, it would arise again and again without end."¹³

**The Prasaṅgika Method**: Candrakīrti defends Buddhapālita against Bhāviveka's criticism. The Mādhyamika need not construct independent inferences (*svatantra-anumāna*) with universally accepted premises. Instead, the opponent's position is refuted through *prasaṅga*—showing the absurd consequences that follow from their own assumptions.¹⁴

As Āryadeva states:
> "For one who has no thesis—  
> Neither existent, non-existent, both existent and non-existent, nor neither—  
> Even after a long time,  
> No objection can be stated."¹⁵

### Footnotes

¹ **[Sanskrit]** *antadvayāvāsavidhūtavāsaḥ* — "whose dwelling is purified from the abode of the two extremes" (eternalism and nihilism).

² **[Cross-reference]** This invocation style mirrors Candrakīrti's *Madhyamakāvatāra* opening.

³ **[Philosophical]** The "rival doctrines" (*paravādimatam*) are principally the Hindu schools (Sāṃkhya, Nyāya, Vaiśeṣika) and non-Mādhyamaka Buddhist schools.

⁴ **[Sanskrit]** *bhavāri-senām* — "the army of the enemy that is cyclic existence."

⁵ **[Dialectical]** *tarkānilānākulitām* — "undisturbed by the winds of logic" signals that this commentary prioritizes scriptural over purely rational approaches.

⁶ **[Philosophical]** These "eight negations" (*aṣṭa-viśeṣaṇa*) are the defining characteristics of dependent origination as understood by the Mādhyamika. Each negation refutes a corresponding wrong view.

⁷ **[Cross-reference]** Cf. MMK 18.9: *prapañcopaśamaśivam* — "the pacification of proliferation, the auspicious."

⁸ **[Sanskrit]** Note Nāgārjuna places *anirodha* (non-cessation) before *anutpāda* (non-arising), reversing the expected causal order.

⁹ **[Historical]** *vadatāṃ varam* — "best of speakers" is a standard epithet for the Buddha, emphasizing his skill in teaching (*upāya-kauśalya*).

¹⁰ **[Cross-reference]** MMK 11.3 — this verse will be examined in the chapter on *Pūrvāparakoṭi-parīkṣā* (Beginning and End).

¹¹ **[Sanskrit]** *jātu* = "at any time"; *kvacana* = "anywhere"; *kecana* = "any whatsoever." The triple indefinites emphasize absolute universality of the negation.

¹² **[Dialectical]** This verse establishes the structure for the entire chapter. Each of the four positions will be refuted in sequence.

¹³ **[Historical]** Buddhapālita (ca. 5th-6th c.) was Candrakīrti's main predecessor in the Prāsaṅgika lineage.

¹⁴ **[Philosophical]** This is the central methodological distinction between Prāsaṅgika and Svātantrika Mādhyamaka. Bhāviveka criticized Buddhapālita for not providing independent proofs; Candrakīrti here defends the *prasaṅga* (consequence) method.

¹⁵ **[Cross-reference]** *Catuḥśataka* 16.25. This verse is also cited in *Vigrahavyāvartanī* 29-30.

### Key Concepts

- **pratītyasamutpāda** (प्रतीत्यसमुत्पाद): Dependent origination. From *pratītya* (having depended) + *samutpāda* (arising together). Candrakīrti specifically rejects the alternative etymology that would derive it from "arising of that which is repeatedly perishing."

- **svabhāva** (स्वभाव): Own-nature, intrinsic nature, self-existence. This is what Mādhyamaka negates—the notion that entities exist by virtue of their own nature, independently of causes and conditions.

- **prasaṅga** (प्रसङ्ग): Consequence, absurd conclusion. The Prāsaṅgika method shows that the opponent's position leads to unwanted consequences, without the Mādhyamika needing to assert any positive thesis.

## Kārikā 4: The Four Conditions

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> catvāraḥ pratyayā hetur ālambanam anantaram |  
> tathaivādhipateyyaṃ ca pratyayo nāsti pañcamaḥ ||4||

### Translation:

> **[4]** The four conditions are: the cause (*hetu*),  
> The object-support (*ālambana*), the immediately preceding (*anantara*),  
> And likewise the dominant condition (*adhipati*)—  
> There is no fifth condition.¹⁶

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

An objection is raised: "The Blessed One himself taught that entities arise from conditions in the form of 'other'! As the Buddha declared:

> *Four are the conditions: cause, object-support, immediately-preceding,  
> And dominant. There is no fifth condition.*

Candrakīrti explains each:
- **Hetu-pratyaya** (causal condition): That which, established in the mode of a seed, is the cause of something
- **Ālambana-pratyaya** (object-condition): That by which an arising dharma arises—its object
- **Anantara-pratyaya** (immediately-preceding condition): The cessation of the cause immediately preceding the arising of the effect (as the cessation of the seed immediately precedes the sprout)
- **Adhipati-pratyaya** (dominant condition): Whatever, when present, allows something to occur

Other conditions (prior-born, simultaneous, subsequent) are included within these four. But conditions such as God (*īśvara*) are impossible—hence "there is no fifth condition."¹⁷

---

## Kārikā 5: No Intrinsic Nature in Conditions

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> na hi svabhāvo bhāvānāṃ pratyayādiṣu vidyate |  
> avidyamāne svabhāve parabhāvo na vidyate ||5||

### Translation:

> **[5]** For no intrinsic nature (*svabhāva*) of entities  
> Is found in conditions and so forth.  
> When intrinsic nature does not exist,  
> Other-nature (*parabhāva*) is not found.¹⁸

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

This is the Mādhyamika response: If the intrinsic nature of effects (shoots, etc.) existed—even prior to arising—in the conditions (seeds, etc.), whether taken together, separately, or both together and separately, or somewhere else, then arising from them would be possible. But there is no such prior existence.¹⁹

Furthermore: if the effect already existed in the conditions prior to arising, the arising would be purposeless. Therefore, entities have no intrinsic nature in conditions.

Without *svabhāva*, there can be no *parabhāva* (other-nature). For "otherness" requires two existing things in mutual relation. But seed and sprout are never simultaneous—when the seed exists, the sprout does not; when the sprout exists, the seed has ceased.²⁰

---

## Kārikā 6: The Problem with "Action" (*kriyā*)

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> kriyā na pratyayavatī nāpratyayavatī kriyā |  
> pratyayā nākriyāvantaḥ kriyāvantaś ca santy uta ||6||

### Translation:

> **[6]** Action is not condition-possessing,  
> Nor is action without conditions.  
> Conditions are not without action,  
> Nor are they possessed of action.²¹

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

An objector argues: "Perhaps it's not the conditions (eye, form, etc.) that directly produce consciousness, but rather an *action* (*kriyā*) that is condition-dependent which produces consciousness—as cooking-action produces rice."

Candrakīrti responds: If there were some action, and if it possessed conditions (eye, etc.), then it might produce consciousness. But there is none. Why? Because an action would have to occur either when consciousness is already arisen, not yet arisen, or currently arising—and none of these are coherent.²²

---

## Kārikā 7: Entities Are Not "Made" by Conditions

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> utpadyate pratītyemān itīme pratyayāḥ kila |  
> yāvan notpadyata ime tāvan nāpratyayāḥ kathaṃ ||7||

### Translation:

> **[7]** "This arises depending on these"—  
> Thus these are said to be conditions.  
> As long as this has not arisen,  
> Why are they not non-conditions?²³

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

If the effect has not yet arisen, on what basis can the conditions be called "conditions"? A condition is defined relationally—as that on which something depends. But if the dependent entity does not yet exist, the relation cannot be established.²⁴

---

## Kārikā 8: Neither Existent Nor Non-Existent Effects

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> naivāsato naiva sataḥ pratyayo 'rthasya yujyate |  
> asataḥ pratyayaḥ kasya sataś ca pratyayena kim ||8||

### Translation:

> **[8]** Neither for a non-existent thing nor for an existent thing  
> Is a condition appropriate.  
> Of what non-existent thing could there be a condition?  
> And for what is existent, what use is a condition?²⁵

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

This verse presents a dilemma:
- If the effect doesn't exist, what would a condition be a condition *of*? You cannot cause the non-existent.
- If the effect already exists, what need is there of conditions? The work is already done.

In neither case can conditions meaningfully function.²⁶

---

## Kārikā 9: The Non-Arising of Dharmas

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> na san nāsan na sadasan dharmo nirvartate yadā |  
> kathaṃ nirvartako hetur evaṃ sati hi yujyate ||9||

### Translation:

> **[9]** When a dharma does not come to be  
> As existent, non-existent, or both,  
> How can there be a productive cause?  
> For [only] if it were so would [causation] be appropriate.²⁷

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

The trilemma: Does the dharma being produced exist, not exist, or both?
- If existent, production is pointless
- If non-existent, production is impossible (like a sky-flower)
- If both, the contradiction is manifest

Since none of these alternatives work, how can we speak of a "productive cause"?²⁸

---

## Kārikā 10: The Problem with "Object" (*ālambana*)

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> asan nimittaṃ nirvṛtter ālambanam iti kriyā |  
> anālambā prasajyeta nāsty anālambanā kriyā ||10||

### Translation:

> **[10]** [If you say] a non-existent is the cause of production,  
> [And] the object-support is "the action,"  
> Then action without object-support would follow—  
> But there is no action without object-support.²⁹

---

## Kārikā 11: Effects Not In Conditions

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> asatsv eva pratyayeṣu phalaṃ yadi na vidyate |  
> pratyayebhyaḥ phalaṃ kac ca nāpratyayebhya āvrajet ||11||

### Translation:

> **[11]** If the effect is not found  
> Existing in the conditions,  
> Then whence would the effect come  
> From conditions—or from non-conditions?³⁰

---

## Kārikā 12: Conditions Neither Produce Nor Not-Produce

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> athāsti phalam etebhyaḥ pratyayebhyaḥ pravartate |  
> pratyayebhyaḥ kim āyātaṃ phalaṃ na pratyayātmakam ||12||

### Translation:

> **[12]** If the effect exists and proceeds  
> From these conditions,  
> Why does it not come from non-conditions—  
> Since the effect is not of the nature of conditions?³¹

---

## Kārikā 13: Effect Neither Contains Nor Lacks Condition-Nature

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> pratyayātmakaṃ phalaṃ pratyayāś cāsvayaṃbhuvaḥ |  
> asvabhāveṣu bhāveṣu svabhāvaḥ kuta eva hi ||13||

### Translation:

> **[13]** The effect is of condition-nature,  
> And conditions are not self-arisen.  
> In entities lacking intrinsic nature,  
> From where indeed would intrinsic nature come?³²

---

## Kārikā 14: Conclusion—Neither Existent Nor Non-Existent

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> tasmān na phalam etebhyaḥ pratyayebhyaḥ pravartate |  
> na cāpratyayato 'py asti phalavat pratyayāḥ kutaḥ ||14||

### Translation:

> **[14]** Therefore, the effect does not proceed  
> From these conditions.  
> Nor does it exist apart from conditions—  
> So from where would there be condition-possessing [effects]?³³

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

This concludes the examination of conditions. The effect does not arise from conditions (for it is not found in them), nor does it arise without conditions (for that would make causation meaningless). The chapter has shown that the four conditions—when analyzed—cannot establish causal production with intrinsic nature.³⁴

## Scholarly Apparatus (Continued)

### Footnotes (16-34)

¹⁶ **[Dialectical]** The four pratyayas are standard Abhidharma categories. Nāgārjuna accepts them provisionally (*saṃvṛti*) to refute them philosophically (*paramārtha*).

¹⁷ **[Historical]** The exclusion of a "fifth condition" (such as *īśvara*, God) refutes the Naiyāyika position that a divine creator is a necessary condition for arising.

¹⁸ **[Sanskrit]** *parabhāva* — "other-nature" or "nature-from-other." This is the key target of the *parataḥ utpatti* refutation.

¹⁹ **[Dialectical]** This argument parallels the refutation of *svataḥ utpatti*: if the effect pre-existed in the conditions, production would be redundant.

²⁰ **[Cross-reference]** This temporal asymmetry argument is developed extensively in Chapter 2 (Gatagata-parīkṣā).

²¹ **[Philosophical]** A tetralemma applied to action: action with conditions, without conditions, conditions with action, conditions without action—all fail.

²² **[Dialectical]** The three-time analysis (past, present, future) that will structure Chapter 2 appears here embryonically.

²³ **[Sanskrit]** *kila* — "so it is said," "allegedly"—Nāgārjuna signals he is reporting the opponent's view, not endorsing it.

²⁴ **[Philosophical]** This is the problem of relational definition: "condition" is defined in relation to "conditioned," but if only one relatum exists, the relation fails.

²⁵ **[Modern]** Cf. the problem of the pre-established harmony in Leibniz—if everything is already set, what work does causation do?

²⁶ **[Dialectical]** Note the dilemma form: both horns are refuted, leaving no coherent middle ground for the opponent.

²⁷ **[Sanskrit]** *nirvartaka* — "productive," "bringing about." From √vṛt (to turn, to act).

²⁸ **[Cross-reference]** This trilemma appears in multiple chapters—cf. MMK 7.20, 12.9, 21.15.

²⁹ **[Philosophical]** The problem of intentionality: consciousness requires an object (*ālambana*), but if that object doesn't exist prior to consciousness, what is consciousness of?

³⁰ **[Dialectical]** A *prasaṅga* argument: if from conditions, why not also from non-conditions? The distinction collapses.

³¹ **[Sanskrit]** *pratyayātmaka* — "having conditions as one's nature." If effect = conditions, they are identical; if not, the connection is arbitrary.

³² **[Philosophical]** The chain: effects depend on conditions → conditions are not self-arisen → therefore neither has *svabhāva* → therefore no *svabhāva* anywhere.

³³ **[Cross-reference]** This verse formally concludes the pratyaya analysis. The chapter continues with further examination of production.

³⁴ **[Historical]** Candrakīrti notes that this refutation applies equally to all opponent schools who assert production with intrinsic nature, whether Buddhist Sarvāstivādins or non-Buddhist schools.

### Key Concepts (Chapter 1)

- **pratyaya** (प्रत्यय): Condition. The four standard conditions analyzed and deconstructed.
- **hetu** (हेतु): Cause proper, the "seed" condition.
- **ālambana** (आलम्बन): Object-support, what consciousness is "of."
- **anantara** (अनन्तर): Immediately-preceding condition—the prior moment whose cessation allows the next.
- **adhipati** (अधिपति): Dominant condition—whatever allows an effect when present.
- **kriyā** (क्रिया): Action, activity. Refuted as an intermediary between conditions and effects.
- **nirvartaka** (निर्वर्तक): Productive, bringing about—the supposed power of causes.

### Argument Summary

| Thesis Refuted | Method | Result |
|:---------------|:-------|:-------|
| Self-origination (*svataḥ*) | Redundancy + infinite regress | Refuted |
| Other-origination (*parataḥ*) | No svabhāva in pratyayas | Refuted |
| Both (*dvābhyām*) | Combines both errors | Refuted |
| Causeless (*ahetukaḥ*) | Chaos would follow | Refuted |

### Soul Check Hints for Bluesman

**Blues Translation Guidance:**

1. **Verse 3 - The Tetralemma**: "Can't be you made yourself, can't be something else made you, can't be both, can't be nothing—so what was it that brought you here, friend?"

2. **Verse 5 - No svabhāva in conditions**: "You keep looking in the seed for the flower, but ain't no flower hiding in there."

3. **Verse 8 - Dilemma of existent/non-existent**: "If it ain't there, how you gonna cause it? If it's already there, what you causing?"

4. **Verse 14 - Conclusion**: "So the chain ain't really chained to nothing, and that's the first step to being free."

5. **The Four Conditions**: Like four promises the world makes—but when you really look, ain't none of them got what they promised.
