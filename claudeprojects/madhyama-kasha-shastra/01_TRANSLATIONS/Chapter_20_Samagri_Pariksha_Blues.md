**Title: "The Missing Ingredient"**

(Verse 1)
If the Seed meets the Fruit, they shakin' hands,
(But two things in one place, the logic don't stand)
If the Seed is the daddy and the Fruit is the son,
They can't be standin' together when the work is done.

(Verse 2)
If they stay apart, like strangers in the street,
(Never say hello, never really meet)
How’s the Seed gonna tell the Fruit to grow?
It’s like tryin' to mail a letter with no place to go.

(Verse 5)
You can't glue 'em together, can't tear 'em apart,
(It’s a broken connection in a hungry heart)
If they touch, they’re the same; if they don't, they’re dead,
Just a circular riddle ringin' in your head.

(Verse 9)
If the Fire goes out before the Water boils,
(All your hard work is just wasted toils)
If the Cause is dead and buried in the ground,
How’s the Effect gonna hear the trumpet sound?

(Verse 11)
If you lock 'em in a room and throw away the key,
(Sayin' "Make me a baby, make me history")
If they fused together like a lump of clay,
You ain't got no Cause, you ain't got no Day.

(Verse 16)
If the Song is already written, why you tryin' to write?
(Why you burnin' candles in the middle of the night?)
If the Song ain't there, in the air or the ink,
You can't pour a glass if there ain't no drink.

(Verse 19)
The Daddy needs the Baby to be a Dad,
(The Baby needs the Daddy or it’s mighty sad)
They lean on each other like a house of cards,
Fallin' down together in the same backyards.

(Verse 24)
You gather up the wood, you gather up the spark,
(Tryin' to make a fire in the chillin' dark)
You call it a "Combination," say it’s guaranteed,
But a pile of zeros is all you really need.
