# Chapter 6: Examination of Desire and the Desirous (Rāgarakta-parīkṣā)

## Introduction

This chapter applies the rigorous dialectic established in the examination of the elements (*dhātu-parīkṣā*, Chapter 5) to the psychological realm. Here, Nāgārjuna investigates the relationship between a defining mental affliction—desire or passion (*rāga*)—and the subject who is characterized by it, the desirous one (*rakta*).

The opponent likely represents an **Abhidharma** perspective, which analyzes the person into discrete, substantially real *dharmas* (mental factors and consciousness). From this view, *rāga* is a distinct, existent mental state (*caitasika*) that arises in relation to a foundation—the person or mind-stream. The **Sāṃkhya** view of a permanent *puruṣa* (self) who "has" mental states is also implicitly targeted.

Nāgārjuna demonstrates that neither the emotion nor the one who has it can be established with intrinsic nature (*svabhāva*). The method parallels Chapter 5: if the desirous one and desire were intrinsically real, they would have to be either identical or different—both options lead to absurdity.

## Kārikā 6.1

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*rāgād yadi bhaved pūrvaṃ rakto rāgam apekṣya tam |*
*rāgaḥ syāt pratibaddhaḥ san rakto hi sati rāgiṇi ||*

**Translation**:
If the desirous one¹ existed prior to desire,² then desire, depending on him, would exist [only] when bound [to him]. For the desirous one exists when there is desire.³

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
Candrakīrti frames the problem: the opponent might claim that a person exists first, and then desire arises in relation to that person. But this creates a paradox—if the "desirous one" (*rakta*) existed before desire, in what sense would he be "desirous"? The very designation depends on the presence of desire. A "desirous one without desire" is a contradiction in terms.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Sanskrit] *rakta* (रक्त): Lit. "stained" or "colored"; the one characterized by passion/desire.
² [Sanskrit] *rāga* (राग): Passion, desire, attachment; one of the three root afflictions (*kleśa*).
³ [Dialectical] This is the first horn of the dilemma: temporal priority of the substrate over the quality.

## Kārikā 6.2

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*raktena hi sahaiva rāgas tad abhinnatvāt tad apekṣaṇāt |*
*rāgo 'py anā śritaḥ kasmād bhaved rāgī ca ko bhavet ||*

**Translation**:
Desire exists only together with the desirous one, for it depends on him and is non-different from him.¹ But if desire has no [independent] basis, how could there be a desirous one?²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
This verse explores the reverse: if desire cannot exist independently of a desirous person, then desire lacks autonomous existence. But if desire itself is not established, how can there be someone defined by having it? The mutual dependence is exposed.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Philosophical] "Non-different" (*abhinna*) here means functionally inseparable, not metaphysically identical.
² [Dialectical] The second horn: if desire depends on *rakta*, but *rakta* depends on *rāga*, we have circular dependency (*anyonyāśraya*).

---

## Kārikā 6.3

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*sahabhāvo na caitasya yukto rāgasya rāgiṇaḥ |*
*bhaveyātām hy anyataś cātma tatra sahabhāvatā ||*

**Translation**:
Simultaneous arising¹ of desire and the desirous one is also not tenable. For [if they arose together], they would be mutually other,² [and then] how could there be [genuine] co-arising?

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
Candrakīrti considers simultaneous origination. If *rāga* and *rakta* arose at the exact same moment, neither could be the cause or ground of the other. They would be utterly distinct (*anya*), and their connection would be arbitrary—like two unrelated events happening to occur together.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Sanskrit] *sahabhāva* (सहभाव): "Co-existence," "simultaneous being."
² [Philosophical] If simultaneous yet distinct, no explanatory relation holds between them.

---

## Kārikā 6.4

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*ekatvena sa eva syād yadi rāgo' tha rāgiṇaḥ |*
*bhinatā syād asaṃsparśaḥ kā syād tatra sahāstitā ||*

**Translation**:
If desire and the desirous one were identical,¹ [the desirous one] would be that very [desire]. If they were different, there would be no contact [between them]²—how could there be co-existence?

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
The classic Mādhyamaka dilemma: identity or difference. If identical, the distinction between the emotion and the person collapses—there is no "one who desires," just desire. If utterly different, they would be like unrelated objects with no necessary connection.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Sanskrit] *ekatva* (एकत्व): "Oneness," identity.
² [Sanskrit] *asaṃsparśa* (असंस्पर्श): "Non-contact," lack of relation or connection.

---

## Kārikā 6.5

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*ekatvena hi rāgasya siddher na syāt sa rāgiṇā |*
*rāgo 'pi na bhavet tasmād rāgiṇā saha vastutaḥ ||*

**Translation**:
If desire were established through identity [with the desirous one], there would be no [distinct] desirous one.¹ Therefore, desire also would not exist together with a desirous one in reality.²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
Candrakīrti draws the consequence: if we collapse the distinction (identity), we lose the very relational structure that gives meaning to "desire" and "desirous one." Without a desirous person distinct from desire, there is no substrate for desire. Without desire, there is no basis for calling someone desirous.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Dialectical] Identity eliminates the relatum—if A = B, then "A and B" loses meaning.
² [Sanskrit] *vastutaḥ* (वस्तुतः): "In reality," "in truth," as opposed to mere convention.

---

## Kārikā 6.6

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*nānātve sati rāgo'sya na dṛṣṭaś cet kathaṃ bhavet |*
*sahāstitā'sya rāgasya rakto rāgeṇa yad vinā ||*

**Translation**:
If [they were] different, desire is not seen [to exist independently].¹ How could there be co-existence of desire and the desirous one, [when the desirous one would exist] without desire?²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
Candrakīrti applies empirical observation: we never observe desire floating free of any person, nor a "desirous one" utterly devoid of desire. Their apparent separateness is not confirmed by experience.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Philosophical] Difference (*nānātvā*) would require independent observability of each term.
² [Cross-reference] This parallels MMK 10's fire/fuel analysis—fire is not seen apart from fuel.

---

## Kārikā 6.7

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*nānātvaṃ yadi siddhyeta rakto rāgeṇa te vinā |*
*nānātve sati sambandhaḥ rāgaraktayor bhavet ||*

**Translation**:
If difference were established, the desirous one would be without desire.¹ And if there were difference, there could be a relation between desire and the desirous one.²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
This verse explores the opponent's escape: "Difference allows for relation!" But Nāgārjuna shows this fails—if truly different, the "desirous one" would be definable without reference to desire, which contradicts his very definition.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Dialectical] A "desirous one without desire" is an oxymoron.
² [Philosophical] The opponent might claim difference grounds relation, but this is explored and rejected.

---

## Kārikā 6.8

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*nānātve sati siddhyāṃ vā kiṃ nānātvaṃ hi kalpyate |*
*ekatvasiddhyartham vā kiṃ naiva ekatvam iṣyate ||*

**Translation**:
If difference were established, why would difference be postulated?¹ Or if identity were to be established, why would identity not be accepted?²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
Candrakīrti points to the logical circularity: the opponent's positions (identity or difference) are adopted to explain the relation, but neither can be independently established. The postulation is arbitrary.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Dialectical] Difference cannot be demonstrated without first establishing the relata—but establishing the relata requires explaining their relation.
² [Philosophical] Both identity and difference are conceptual imputations (*kalpanā*), not intrinsic facts.

---

## Kārikā 6.9

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*nānātvaṃ na hi sidhyeta yathāsty anupapannatā |*
*tasmād rāgī ca rāgaś ca grāhyagrāhakayor iva ||*

**Translation**:
Difference is indeed not established, as [their separate] existence is untenable.¹ Therefore, the desirous one and desire are like the apprehended and the apprehender.²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
Candrakīrti introduces an analogy: the "grasped" (*grāhya*—the object of cognition) and the "grasper" (*grāhaka*—the cognizing subject) are similarly mutually dependent. Neither can be found independently. This anticipates cognitive analyses in later chapters.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Philosophical] *anupapannatā*: "Untenability," logical failure.
² [Cross-reference] *grāhya-grāhaka* analysis is central to Yogācāra and is critiqued in MMK 18.

## Kārikā 6.10

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*rāgaraktaparīkṣeyaṃ sarvakleśeṣu yujyate |*
*sarvāyataneṣu caiva sarvakleśopaśāntiṣu ||*

**Translation**:
This examination of desire and the desirous one applies to all afflictions,¹ to all sense-bases,² and to the cessation of all afflictions.³

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
The chapter concludes with explicit universalization. The analysis is not limited to *rāga*—it applies equally to *dveṣa* (hatred) and the hater, *moha* (delusion) and the deluded, and so forth. It extends to all *āyatanas* (sense-bases) and even to the purification process itself.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Sanskrit] *kleśa* (क्लेश): Afflictions—*rāga*, *dveṣa*, *moha*, etc.
² [Sanskrit] *āyatana* (आयतन): Sense-bases—the six sense organs and their objects.
³ [Soteriological] Even liberation cannot be reified—the "one who is liberated" and "liberation" are also empty.

### Key Concepts

| Term | Sanskrit | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| **rāga** | राग | Desire, passion, attachment; one of the three poisons |
| **rakta** | रक्त | The desirous one; lit. "stained" or "colored" by passion |
| **kleśa** | क्लेश | Affliction; mental state that causes suffering |
| **dveṣa** | द्वेष | Hatred, aversion; second of the three poisons |
| **moha** | मोह | Delusion, ignorance; third of the three poisons |
| **grāhya** | ग्राह्य | The apprehended; object of cognition |
| **grāhaka** | ग्राहक | The apprehender; cognizing subject |
| **anyonyāśraya** | अन्योन्याश्रय | Mutual dependence; circular support |
| **sahabhāva** | सहभाव | Simultaneous existence; co-arising |

### Argument Structure

**Pūrvapakṣa (Opponent's Position)**:
The Abhidharma/Sarvāstivāda holds that mental afflictions (*kleśa*) like desire are real, distinct *dharmas* that arise in a mind-stream. The "desirous one" is the conventional designation for the aggregate of such states. Both exist substantially (as distinct *dharmas* in relation).

**Mādhyamaka Response (Prasaṅga)**:
1. **Establish Mutual Dependency** (6.2-3): Neither *rāga* nor *rakta* can be identified without the other
2. **Refute Identity** (6.4-5): Leads to confusion of action and agent
3. **Refute Difference** (6.5-7): Leads to an independent *rakta* devoid of *rāga*, which is absurd
4. **Apply Perception Analogy** (6.6): Neither identity nor difference is empirically verifiable
5. **Conclusion via Tetralemma** (6.8): Both identity and difference are untenable
6. **Analogical Clarification** (6.9): Their existence is relational, like grasper/grasped
7. **Universalization** (6.10): Emptiness of one implies emptiness of all afflictions
