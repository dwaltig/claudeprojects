**Title: "The Jailhouse Blues"**

(Verse 1)
I been wanderin' round this circle since the day I was born,
(Shoes are tattered and my soul is worn)
But if I ain't the body and I ain't the mind,
Tell me who it is that’s leavin' these tracks behind?

(Verse 2)
I looked in the mirror, checked the eyes and the skin,
(Looked for the sinner who committed the sin)
But I couldn't find the Walker, just the dust on the road,
A heavy sensation without no load.

(Verse 3)
If my soul is eternal, it can't move an inch,
(Like a stone statue on a marble bench)
If my soul is a shadow that fades in the light,
Then who’s gonna make it through the long, dark night?

(Verse 4)
You say you want Freedom, you want to be free,
(But tell me, brother, who is this "Me"?)
A ghost can't be handcuffed, a ghost can't be chained,
And a ghost can't be dry when it’s pourin' rain.

(Verse 5)
The shackles don't hold me, the cell ain't real,
(It’s just a spinnin' cog in a phantom wheel)
Things come together and things fall apart,
But nothin' ever enters the human heart.

(Verse 6)
If you holdin' on tight, you’re already bound,
(Chasin' your tail like a hungry hound)
If you let it all go, there ain't nothin' to tie,
Just a wide open space in a empty sky.

(Verse 7)
Can't lock up a prisoner before he’s a man,
(That ain't the way that the warden planned)
If the prisoner is missin', the jail is a joke,
Just iron bars made of cigarette smoke.

(Verse 8)
If you’re tied to the track, you can't walk away,
(And if you’re walkin' away, you ain't tied today)
You can't be a prisoner and a free man too,
That’s a logical riddle that’ll make you blue.

(Verse 9)
"I’m gonna get to Heaven, I’m gonna be saved,"
(That’s what it says on the stone on the grave)
But wantin' to be empty is the biggest load,
Just another heavy sack on the same old road.

(Verse 10)
I stopped lookin' for Freedom, stopped runnin' from Pain,
(Stopped tryin' to stay dry in the pourin' rain)
Samsara and Nirvana, they’re the same damn town,
Just depends on if you’re up or if you’re down.
