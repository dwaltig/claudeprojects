## Verse 27.1
**dṛṣṭayo 'bhūt pūrvaṃ nāham abhūt pūrvam kiṃ nv aham |**
**iti yās tāḥ pūrvāntasamiśritāḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"The views 'I existed in the past' or 'I did not exist in the past'—
These are the views related to the prior limit (the past)."

**Commentary**:
*   **The 14 Unanswered Questions (*Avyākṛta*)**: This chapter addresses the classic metaphysical questions the Buddha refused to answer:
    1. Is the world eternal?
    2. Is the world not eternal?
    3. Is it both?
    4. Is it neither?
    5. Is the world finite?
    6. Is the world infinite?
    7. Is it both?
    8. Is it neither?
    9. Does the Tathāgata exist after death?
    10. Does he not exist?
    11. Both?
    12. Neither?
    13. Is the soul the same as the body?
    14. Is the soul different from the body?
    *Nāgārjuna demonstrates that these questions are flawed because they presuppose a "Self" or "World" with intrinsic nature.*

## Verse 27.2
**dṛṣṭayo na bhaviṣyāmy aham kim nu bhaviṣyāmy aham |**
**iti yās tāś cāparāntasamiśritāḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"The views 'I will exist in the future' or 'I will not exist in the future'—
These are the views related to the posterior limit (the future)."

**Commentary**:
*   **Aparānta** ("Posterior Limit"): Speculation about the destiny of the self. Immortality vs. Annihilation.

## Verse 27.3
**abhūt pūrvam ity eṣa na yujyata iyam dṛṣṭiḥ |**
**yaḥ kṣamaś ca pūrvasya sa naivāyam na cānyaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"The view 'I existed in the past' is not logical.
For that one who existed in the past is not this one, nor is he other than this one."

**Commentary**:
*   **Naiva ayam** ("Not this one"): If I am exactly the same as my past self, I would be an infant right now.
*   **Na ca anyaḥ** ("Not other"): If I am totally different, I would not inherit the karma of that infant.

## Verse 27.6
**na copapadyate saiva yadi hi syāt sa eva saḥ |**
**upādānam viyuktam syād evaṃ hi syād anityatā ||**

**Translation**:
"It is not logical that it is the very same [self]. For if it were the very same,
The grasper would be distinct from the grasping. And in that case, [the self] would be permanent."

**Commentary**:
*   **Upādāna** ("Grasping/Aggregates"): If the Self stays the same while the body changes, the Self is separate from the body. A disembodied Self is a fiction.

## Verse 27.8
**na caivāsty anupādānaḥ sa cātmā nāsty upādānam |**
**na cāsti sa cātmā nāsty upādānavān ||**

**Translation**:
"There is no self without grasping; nor is the self the grasping.
Nor is the self the possessor of grasping."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Middle Way**: The Self is not the body, not separate from the body, and doesn't own the body. It is a label applied to the flow.

## Verse 27.13
**antavān sa loka iti kiṃ etad upapadyate |**
**yasmān na cānyo nānyo hi saṃtāne pūrvajanmanaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"The view 'The world is finite'—how is this logical?
For the continuum of previous births is not other, nor is it non-other."

**Commentary**:
*   **Antavān** ("Finite"): Does the world end? If the self is a continuum (*saṃtāna*), there is no hard line where "I" stop and "World" begins.

## Verse 27.19
**kuto 'ntasyāpy abhāve 'nantaṃ nāma bhaviṣyati |**
**anantasyāpy abhāve kuto 'ntavan nāma bhaviṣyati ||**

**Translation**:
"In the absence of the finite, whence will there be the infinite?
In the absence of the infinite, whence will there be the finite?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Mutual Dependence**: Finite and Infinite are relative terms. You cannot assert one without the other. Both are conceptual constructs (*kalpanā*).

## Verse 27.30 (The Final Homage)
**sarvadṛṣṭiprahāṇāya yaḥ saddharmam adeśayat |**
**anukampām upādāya taṃ namasyāmi gautamam ||**

**Translation**:
"To Him who taught the True Dharma for the relinquishing of all views,
Out of compassion—I bow down to that Gautama."

**Commentary**:
*   **Sarva-dṛṣṭi-prahāṇāya** ("For the relinquishing of all views"): This is the thesis statement of the entire MMK. Madhyamaka is not a view; it is the medicine to vomit out all views.
*   **Cross-Reference**: See **Chapter 24.14** ("All is logical for him for whom emptiness is logical"). The abandonment of views allows for the dynamic functioning of the world.
