# Chapter 3: Looking at Seeing
## *Can the Eye See What It's Doing?*

### Blues Vernacular Translation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening

*Now friends, this chapter is shorter than the last two, but don't let that fool you. Nāgārjuna's about to take apart something you use every minute of every day—your seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and thinking. If these fall apart, what's left standing?*

---

## Part One: The Six Ways You Know the World

First, let's name what we're talking about:

1. **Seeing** — the eye and its business
2. **Hearing** — the ear and its business  
3. **Smelling** — the nose and its business
4. **Tasting** — the tongue and its business
5. **Touching** — the body and its business
6. **Thinking** — the mind and its business

The scriptures say these six are how you know the world. Forms, sounds, smells, tastes, textures, thoughts—these are what the six senses go after.¹

Fine. Let's look at one of them and see what we find.

## Part Two: Can Seeing See Itself?

Here's the first question:

> *That seeing—does it see itself?  
> No, it don't.  
> And if it can't see itself,  
> How's it gonna see anything else?*²

Think about it. Can your eye look at your eye—not in a mirror, but directly, the seeing looking at the seeing itself?

No. It's like asking a knife to cut itself.³ The blade can cut everything in the world except its own edge.

And here's the kicker: if seeing can't see itself, how do we know it's really "seeing" at all? Maybe it's more like a wall or a pillar—something that don't see nothing.⁴

## Part Three: What About Fire?

"Hold on," someone says. "Fire don't burn itself, but it sure burns other things. Maybe seeing is like that—it sees other things even though it can't see itself."

Nāgārjuna says: nice try, but no.

> *The fire example don't work.  
> Whatever you said about walking,  
> Same thing applies to burning.*⁵

Remember Chapter 2? The burned-thing ain't being burned. The not-yet-burned ain't being burned. And there's no "being-burned" apart from those two.

Same with the burner: the burner don't burn, and the non-burner don't burn.

So fire ain't got no solid self either. Can't use an empty example to prove something's solid.⁶

## Part Four: No Seeing, No Seer

If seeing falls apart, so does the seer:

> *What we said about seeing—  
> Same thing goes for the one who sees.*⁷

The seer needs seeing to be a seer. But we just showed seeing ain't solid. So the seer ain't solid neither.

And now watch the whole thing collapse:

> *No seer without seeing,  
> No seeing without seer,  
> No "thing seen" without both.  
> Which one you gonna start with?*⁸

They're all leaning on each other, and ain't none of them got legs.

---

## Part Five: What About Consciousness?

"But wait," someone pleads. "Even if we can't find a solid seer or seen, there's still consciousness. When the eye meets a form, consciousness arises. That proves something's happening!"

Nāgārjuna responds:

> *If there ain't no "seen" and no "seeing,"  
> Then the consciousness that's supposed to come from them,  
> And the contact, and the feeling, and the craving—  
> Where they gonna come from?*⁹

If the foundation is empty, what's built on it is empty too.

---

## Part Six: All the Senses Fall

And here's the final move:

> *What we said about seeing,  
> Same thing applies to hearing, smelling,  
> Tasting, touching, and thinking.  
> The hearer, the heard—all of it.*¹⁰

You can run this analysis on any sense:
- Can the ear hear itself hearing?
- Can the nose smell itself smelling?
- Can the mind think itself thinking?

Every time, you hit the same wall. The sense can't catch itself in the act. And without that, you can't prove it's really doing what you claim.¹¹

## What This Means for Your Life

Now here's where the Blues comes in, friend.

All day long, you're trusting your eyes, your ears, your thoughts. "I saw it with my own eyes!" "I heard what they said!" "I know what I think!"

And Nāgārjuna says: look at the looking itself. What you find is... no solid looker, no solid looking, no solid thing looked at. Three emptinesses leaning on each other, and we call it "experience."

This ain't saying you're not experiencing. Things are happening. But the way you *think* it works—a solid ME seeing a solid WORLD—that ain't how it is.

When you see this, something relaxes. You stop trusting your senses as the last word on reality. You stop saying "I know what I saw" like it's the end of the conversation.

The Buddha said:

> *"The eye don't see forms.  
> The mind don't know things.  
> This is the highest truth—  
> And the world don't enter it."*¹²

That ain't nihilism. That's freedom from being trapped by what you think you know.

## Endnotes

¹ **"The six ways you know the world"**: These are the *ṣaḍ-āyatana*, the six sense-bases. In Buddhist psychology, ALL experience comes through one of these six doors.

² **"Can seeing see itself?"**: This is the problem of self-reflexivity. Can the eye be both the seer AND the seen at the same time? Nāgārjuna says no.

³ **"Like asking a knife to cut itself"**: Candrakīrti uses this analogy (*svātmani kriyā-virodha*—contradiction of action upon itself). Other examples: a fingertip can't touch itself; a scale can't weigh itself.

⁴ **"Like a wall or a pillar"**: If seeing can't prove it's seeing by seeing itself, it hasn't established that it sees at all. It might be like a non-seeing thing.

⁵ **"Whatever you said about walking"**: The Chapter 2 arguments apply to all activities—walking, burning, seeing, hearing. The structure is identical.

⁶ **"Can't use an empty example to prove something's solid"**: The fire analogy fails because fire itself, when analyzed, has no inherent nature. You can't use one empty thing to establish another.

⁷ **"Same thing goes for the one who sees"**: The *draṣṭṛ* (seer) is refuted the same way as *darśana* (seeing). They're two words for one empty relationship.

⁸ **"Which one you gonna start with?"**: This is *anyonyāśraya*—mutual dependence. Seer needs seeing, seeing needs seer, both need the seen, the seen needs them. Circular, with no foundation.

⁹ **"Where they gonna come from?"**: If the sense-base is unfounded, the whole chain of dependent origination (consciousness → contact → feeling → craving → grasping) has no ground.

¹⁰ **"Same thing applies to hearing..."**: This is *atideśa*—extension by analogy. Nāgārjuna doesn't repeat all the arguments for each sense; he says "apply it yourself."

¹¹ **"The sense can't catch itself in the act"**: This is the core problem of immediate experience. We can't step outside experience to verify it's happening the way we think.

¹² **"The eye don't see forms"**: This quotation appears in the *Lalitavistara* and other sutras. It doesn't mean nothing happens—it means the way we conceptualize seeing (solid eye seeing solid forms) is not the ultimate truth.

### Theological Notes

**For those who want the deep doctrine:**

Chapter 3 applies the Chapter 2 analysis to sensation itself. This is significant because sensation is the most "immediate" form of experience—it seems undeniable. "I'm seeing this right now!" But Nāgārjuna shows that the structure of seer-seeing-seen has the same problem as goer-going-gone.

The key move is **self-reflexivity**: if seeing can see, it should be able to see itself. But it can't. This doesn't mean seeing doesn't happen—it means seeing has no *svabhāva*, no independent, self-standing nature.

This has profound implications for meditation practice. When you look at the mind looking, you find nothing solid. This is **vipaśyanā**—insight meditation. Not creating emptiness, but *seeing* the emptiness that was always there.

The Buddha's statement that "the eye does not see forms" is not a denial of conventional experience. It's a statement about ultimate truth (*paramārtha*). Conventionally, of course we see. Ultimately, none of the three elements (seer, seeing, seen) can be found with inherent existence.
