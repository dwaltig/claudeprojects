## Chapter 9: Pūrva-parīkṣā (Examination of the Prior Entity)

### Introduction
This chapter critiques the notion of a fixed, substantial perceiver (*grāhaka*) that exists *prior* to the act of perception (*grahaṇa*). Nāgārjuna deconstructs the reification of the subjective pole of experience, showing it to be dependently originated and empty of inherent existence.

### Key Verses (Summarized)
- **MMK 9.1:** Directly questions the logical possibility of a perceiver existing before, after, or simultaneously with perception.
- **MMK 9.2-4:** Systematically dismantles these three temporal possibilities, demonstrating their incoherence. A perceiver without perception is a contradiction; a perceiver simultaneous with perception cannot be said to be "prior."
- **MMK 9.5:** Concludes that since no prior perceiver is established, all phenomena depending on such a perceiver are also empty.

### Core Argument
- The "prior perceiver" is a conceptual reification projected onto the fluid process of experience.
- Temporal analysis (before/after/simultaneous) fails to locate an inherent perceiver.
- This undermines the opponent's (likely Sāṃkhya or certain Abhidharma) claim of a permanent witnessing self (*sākṣin*).

## Chapter 10: Agnīndhana-parīkṣā (Examination of Fire and Fuel)

### Introduction
A tour de force of Mādhyamaka dialectic. Using the paradigmatic example of fire (*agni*) and fuel (*indhana*), Nāgārjuna demonstrates the impossibility of establishing inherent identity or difference between mutually dependent phenomena. This chapter is frequently cited as the clearest illustration of his method.

### Key Verses (Summarized)
- **MMK 10.1-2:** Fire is not identical to fuel (else burning would be self-immolation), nor utterly different (else fire could exist without fuel).
- **MMK 10.10-11:** Neither fire nor fuel can be said to exist prior to the other; their arising is mutual and simultaneous from the ultimate perspective.
- **MMK 10.13-16:** The fire/fuel example is explicitly applied to the self (*ātman*) and the aggregates (*upādāna-skandha*), previewing Chapter 18.

### Core Argument
- Identity and difference are exhaustive logical options; both fail for inherently existent entities.
- Fire and fuel are dependently designated (*prajñapti*), not substantially real.
- This model applies to all relata: self/aggregates, desire/desirous, action/agent.

### Key Terms

| Sanskrit | English | Scholarly Note |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Agni** | Fire | Paradigmatic for any dependent phenomenon. |
| **Indhana** | Fuel, kindling | That which "supports" fire dependently. |
| **Upādāna** | Grasping, fuel, aggregates | Double meaning: the fuel of fire and the five aggregates that "fuel" the self. |
| **Siddhi** | Establishment, proof | The successful demonstration of inherent existence (which is denied). |

## Chapter 11: Pūrvāparakoṭi-parīkṣā (Examination of Beginning and End)

### Introduction
This chapter investigates the temporal limits of saṃsāra (the cycle of conditioned existence). Nāgārjuna argues that neither an ultimate beginning (*pūrvakoṭi*) nor an ultimate end (*aparakoṭi*) can be established, because such concepts presuppose the very inherent existence his analysis refutes.

### Key Verses (Summarized)
- **MMK 11.1:** Saṃsāra's beginning is not apprehensible; we cannot point to a "first moment" of cyclic existence.
- **MMK 11.3-5:** If conditioned phenomena lacked a determinable origin, the relationship between aging-and-death (*jarāmaraṇa*) and prior moments (*jātī*) becomes inexplicable, yet even this relationship is empty.
- **MMK 11.8:** Concludes that all designations of "before" and "after" are conventional impositions, not ultimate features of reality.

### Core Argument
- A "first cause" or absolute beginning requires something to stand outside the causal series, which is incoherent.
- Similarly, a final "end" would imply inherent cessation, another conceptual extreme.
- Saṃsāra is beginningless and endless not as an infinite series, but as a structure that cannot be pinned down by such concepts.

### Key Terms

| Sanskrit | English | Scholarly Note |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Pūrvakoṭi** | Prior limit, beginning | The conceptual extreme of origination. |
| **Aparakoṭi** | Posterior limit, end | The conceptual extreme of cessation. |
| **Jarāmaraṇa** | Aging-and-dying | The twelfth link in dependent origination. |
| **Prapañca** | Conceptual proliferation | Mental fabrication of dichotomies and reified concepts. |

## Chapter 12: Duḥkha-parīkṣā (Examination of Suffering)

### Introduction
This chapter analyzes the origin of suffering (*duḥkha*) via the classic *catuṣkoṭi* (tetralemma). Nāgārjuna examines and rejects all four possible positions—that suffering is self-produced, other-produced, both, or neither—revealing the emptiness of suffering itself.

### Key Verses (Summarized)
- **MMK 12.1:** Presents the tetralemma regarding the production of suffering: from self (*svataḥ*), from other (*parataḥ*), from both, or from neither.
- **MMK 12.2-8:** Each position is systematically refuted. Self-causation implies identity of cause and effect; other-causation implies complete independence; both compounds errors; neither implies causelessness (rejected by all Buddhist schools).
- **MMK 12.9-10:** Concludes that since suffering is not produced from any of the four positions, it is empty (*śūnya*). An empty suffering cannot truly "bind" anyone.

### Core Argument
- If suffering had inherent existence, it would need an identifiable, inherent cause. None can be found.
- The rejection of all four options demonstrates that the concept of "suffering" as an independently arising entity is false.
- This de-reification of suffering cuts at the root of existential anguish, as what is empty cannot be a source of ultimate bondage.

### Key Terms

| Sanskrit | English | Scholarly Note |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| **Duḥkha** | Suffering, unsatisfactoriness | The first Noble Truth, here analyzed as empty. |
| **Catuṣkoṭi** | Tetralemma | The fourfold negation: is, is not, both, neither. |
| **Svataḥ** | From itself | First limb: self-causation. |
| **Parataḥ** | From another | Second limb: other-causation. |
| **Bandhana** | Bondage | The apparent binding power of suffering, shown to be illusory. |
