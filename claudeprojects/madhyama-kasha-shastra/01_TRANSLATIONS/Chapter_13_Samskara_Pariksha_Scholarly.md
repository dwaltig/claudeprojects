## Verse 13.1
**tan mṛṣā moṣadharma yad bhagavān ity abhāṣata |**
**sarve ca saṃskārās tasmān mṛṣā te moṣadharmiṇaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"That which is deceptive in nature is false—so the Blessed One spoke.
Therefore, all compounded phenomena are false, for they are deceptive in nature."

**Commentary**:
*   **Moṣadharma** ("Deceptive/Fraudulent nature"): Root *muṣ* (to steal/deceive). Compounded things appear to have a stability and reality they lack.
*   **Mṛṣā** ("False"): Not that they don't exist at all, but that they are false in their claim to intrinsic existence (*svabhāva*).

## Verse 13.2
**tan mṛṣā moṣadharma yad yadi kiṃ tatra muṣyate |**
**etaduktaṃ bhagavatā śūnyatāpari dīpanam ||**

**Translation**:
"If that which is deceptive in nature is false, what is it that is being deceived?
This was spoken by the Blessed One as an illumination of Emptiness."

**Commentary**:
*   **Śūnyatā-paridīpanam** ("Illumination of Emptiness"): The Buddha uses the "deception" metaphor not to posit a real deceiver or a real victim, but to point to the lack of inherent nature in the entire process.

## Verse 13.3
**bhāvānāṃ niḥsvabhāvatvaṃ anyathābhāvadarśanāt |**
**asvabhāvo bhāvo nāsti bhāvānāṃ śūnyatā yataḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"The absence of intrinsic nature in entities [is known] from the perception of change.
There is no entity without intrinsic nature; [but] for entities, there is emptiness."

**Commentary**:
*   **Anyathābhāva** ("Becoming otherwise/Change"): The empirical fact of change proves the absence of *svabhāva*. If a seed had the "nature" of a seed, it could never become a sprout.
*   **Niḥsvabhāvatva** ("Naturelessness"): This is synonymous with Emptiness.

## Verse 13.4
**kasya syād anyathābhāvaḥ svabhāvo yadi vidyate |**
**kasya syād anyathābhāvaḥ svabhāvo yadi nāsti ca ||**

**Translation**:
"Of what would there be change if intrinsic nature were to exist?
And of what would there be change if intrinsic nature were not to exist?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Paradox of Change**:
    1. If X has a fixed nature, it cannot change (by definition).
    2. If X has no nature (is a non-entity), what is there to undergo change?

## Verse 13.5
**tasyaiva nānyathābhāvaḥ kutaś cid anyathābhāvaḥ |**
**na hy anyasyaiva bhāvasya bhavaty anyathābhāvatā ||**

**Translation**:
"There is no change of that very same [thing]; nor is there change of [something] other.
Indeed, for an entity which is [totally] other, change does not occur."

**Commentary**:
*   **Identity vs. Difference**: Milk doesn't change into curd if they are identical (it was already curd) or if they are totally unrelated "others" (like a horse and a cow). Change requires a continuity that *svabhāva* logic cannot provide.

## Verse 13.6
**yuvā na jīryate tasmād vṛddhaś cāpi na jīryate |**
**yuvā na jīryate tasmād anyo yuvā na jīryate ||**

**Translation**:
"Therefore, the youth does not age; nor does the aged person age.
The youth does not age, because [being youth] he is not the aged; and another [person] does not age."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Youth Paradox**: The youth is not "aging" while he is a youth (because he is young). The old man is not "aging" because he is already old. Aging is a process that escapes reified temporal blocks.

## Verse 13.7
**yady aśūnyam bhavet kiṃ cic chyūnyam ity api tad bhavet |**
**na kiṃ cid asty aśūnyaṃ ca kutaḥ śūnyaṃ bhaviṣyati ||**

**Translation**:
"If there were something non-empty, then there would be something called 'empty.'
[But] there is nothing whatsoever that is non-empty; whence will there be the empty?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Relativity of Emptiness**: Emptiness is not a "thing" or a "substance." It is a conceptual designation used to negate "non-emptiness." If you can't find anything with a nature, "emptiness" itself loses its status as a positive category. *Note: This prevents the reification of Emptiness. Emptiness is itself empty of inherent existence (*śūnyatā-śūnyatā*).*

## Verse 13.8
**śūnyatā sarvadṛṣṭīnāṃ proktā niḥsaraṇaṃ jinaiḥ |**
**yeṣāṃ tu śūnyatā dṛṣṭis tān asādhyān babhāṣire ||**

**Translation**:
"Emptiness is declared by the Victors [Buddhas] to be the relinquishing of all views.
But those for whom emptiness is [itself] a view are declared to be incurable."

**Commentary**:
*   **Asādhya** ("Incurable/Beyond help"): This is one of the most famous verses in the MMK. Emptiness is the medicine for the "disease" of reification. If you swallow the medicine and it turns into a new disease (a "view" to cling to), there is no other remedy.
*   **Niḥsaraṇam** ("Exit/Relinquishing"): Emptiness is a way out, not a destination.
