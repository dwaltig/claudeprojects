**Title: "The Man Who Wasn't There"**

(Verse 1)
I looked for the Buddha in the temple hall,
(Looked for his shadow on the painted wall)
He wasn't the paint, and he wasn't the stone,
And he wasn't hidin' in the golden throne.

(Verse 2)
If he’s made of parts, like a old V-8,
(Runnin' on karma and runnin' on fate)
Then he ain't got a soul that stands alone,
Just a engine rattlin' in the danger zone.

(Verse 3)
You can't have the Man without the Parts,
(You can't have the Love without the Hearts)
If you strip 'em away, sayin' "Show me the King,"
You ain't gonna find a solitary thing.

(Verse 4)
If he was Real before the body was born,
(Waitin' in the sky like a harvest corn)
Why would he come down to this dirty place?
Why would he wear a dyin' human face?

(Verse 11)
Don't call him "Empty," don't call him "Full,"
(That’s just the wool that the preachers pull)
"Empty" is a word for a jar that’s dry,
"Full" is a word for a cloudy sky.
It’s just a signpost pointin' down the road,
Help you carry the heavy, heavy load.

(Verse 12)
Is he Forever? Is he Gonna Die?
(Is he in the ground or in the sky?)
You askin' questions that don't make sense,
Like askin' a cloud for fifty cents.
When the fire goes out, where does it go?
That’s a secret that the ashes know.

(Verse 13)
If you think he’s solid, like a piece of wood,
(You misunderstood, yeah, you misunderstood)
You tryin' to catch smoke in a butterfly net,
Gonna wake up soakin' in a cold, cold sweat.

(Verse 15)
You paintin' pictures of a man so grand,
(With a lotus flower in his open hand)
But if you worship the picture, you miss the Man,
You miss the silence where it all began.

(Verse 16)
You wanna know the Buddha? Look at yourself,
(Don't look at the statue on the dusty shelf)
The Empty Nature that makes him Free,
Is the same Empty Nature in you and me.
We’re all just shadows in the same old play,
Dancin' in the light of the breakin' day.
