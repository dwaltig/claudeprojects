## Verse 21.1
**vinā vā saha vā nāsti vibhavaḥ saṃbhavena vai |**
**vinā vā saha vā nāsti saṃbhavo vibhavena vai ||**

**Translation**:
"Destruction does not exist either without or with production.
Production does not exist either without or with destruction."

**Commentary**:
*   **Saṃbhava/Vibhava** ("Production/Destruction"): Or "Arising/Passing."
*   **Vinā** ("Without"): If Production exists without Destruction, it would be eternal (*nitya*).
*   **Saha** ("With"): If they exist simultaneously, one would be dying at the very moment of birth.

## Verse 21.2
**bhaviṣyati kathaṃ nāma vibhavaḥ saṃbhaṃ vinā |**
**vinaiva janma maraṇaṃ vinaivārambhato vyayaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"How indeed will destruction exist without production?
[It would be like] death without birth, or cessation without a beginning."

**Commentary**:
*   **Absurdity**: You can't destroy what was never built. Destruction depends on Production.

## Verse 21.3
**saṃbhavenaiva vibhavaḥ katham saha bhaviṣyati |**
**na janmamaraṇaṃ caiva tulyakālaṃ hi vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"How will destruction exist simultaneously with production?
For birth and death are not found at the same time."

**Commentary**:
*   **Contradiction**: Light and Darkness cannot occupy the same space. Life and Death are mutually exclusive states.

---

## Verse 21.4
**bhaviṣyati kathaṃ nāma saṃbhavo vibhavaṃ vinā |**
**anityatā hi bhāveṣu na kadācin na vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"How indeed will production exist without destruction?
For impermanence is never not found in entities."

**Commentary**:
*   **Anityatā** ("Impermanence"): This is the key argument. Impermanence is not something that happens *to* an object later; it is the nature of the object from the start. If Production were separate from Destruction, things would be static.

## Verse 21.6
**sahānyonyena vā siddhir vinānyonyena vā yayoḥ |**
**na vidyate tayoḥ siddhiḥ kathaṃ nu khalu vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Of which two the establishment is not found either with one another or without one another—
How indeed is the establishment of those two found?"

**Commentary**:
*   **The Collapse**: Since neither the "Simultaneous Model" nor the "Sequential Model" works, both concepts—Birth and Death—are empty.

---

## Verse 21.11
**dṛśyate saṃbhavaś caiva na vibhavena bādhyate |**
**na saṃbhavena vibhavaḥ kāla bhedena yujyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Production appears, and it is not blocked by destruction.
Nor is destruction [blocked] by production; it is logical due to the difference in time."

**Commentary**:
*   **Opponent's View**: "But we *see* things arise and then later die. There is a time gap (*kāla-bheda*)."
*   **Rejoinder**: If there is a gap, the thing exists eternally during that gap (see Verse 21.4).

## Verse 21.13
**bhavāṃś ced āha bhāvānāṃ sāntir eva na saṃbhavaḥ |**
**yadi kaścid bhaved bhāvaḥ sāntir eva bhaved iha ||**

**Translation**:
"If you say that for entities there is only cessation, not production—
If some entity were to exist, cessation would exist here."

**Commentary**:
*   **Refutation of Nihilism**: You can't have "Just Cessation." Cessation requires a prior Entity. No Entity = No Cessation.

---

## Verse 21.17
**parabhāve 'bhyupagate saṃbhavo vibhavaḥ kutaḥ |**
**ekasyārthasya nānātvaṃ kutaḥ saṃbhavavibhavau ||**

**Translation**:
"If 'other-nature' is accepted, whence are production and destruction?
[If] there is multiplicity of a single object, whence are production and destruction?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Identity Problem**: If the "Seed" destroys itself to become a "Sprout," are they the same or different? If same, no change. If different, no continuity.

---

## Verse 21.21
**saṃbhavo vibhavaś caiva nityam ātmani dṛśyate |**
**saṃbhavo vibhavaś caiva vyākhyāto 'nena karmaṇā ||**

**Translation**:
"Production and destruction are seen constantly in the Self.
Production and destruction have been explained by this [analysis of] action."

**Commentary**:
*   **Conclusion**: The logic applied to entities applies to the Soul. The Soul is not born, nor does it die. It is empty.
