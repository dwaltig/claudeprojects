**Title: "Ain't No Start Line"**

(Verse 1)
The Big Boss Man said it, way back in the day,
(Before the blues was born, before we learned to play)
You can search the horizon, look for where it began,
But there ain't no start line for the soul of a man.

(Verse 2)
If you ain't got a beginning, you can't have an end,
(It’s a circle, baby, twistin' round the bend)
How you gonna find the middle of a ring?
It’s just an endless song that the shadows sing.

(Verse 3)
If Birth came first, strutting proud and tall,
(Before the winter wind began to call)
You’d be an immortal baby, never growin' old,
A story with a beginning that can never be told.

(Verse 4)
If Death came first, waitin' at the gate,
(Before you even born, sealin' up your fate)
Then who is doing the dyin', if nobody’s there?
Just a grim reaper cuttin' empty air.

(Verse 5)
If they walked in together, hand in hand,
(Birth and Death dancin' in the same old band)
You’d be dyin' while you’re cryin' your very first breath,
A cradle made of cypress, smellin' like death.

(Verse 6)
You can’t put 'em in order, you can’t make 'em fit,
(The pieces of the puzzle just don't wanna sit)
So why you buildin' castles out of smoke and sand?
Tryin' to map a river in a floodin' land.

(Verse 7)
It ain't just livin', it’s the cause and the effect,
(Every broken promise that you try to collect)
The feelin' and the feeler, the hammer and the stone,
Ain't nobody started this trouble alone.

(Verse 8)
It ain't just the sorrow, it ain't just the pain,
(It’s every drop of water in the pourin' rain)
Nothin' has a birthday, nothin' has a tomb,
Just an endless weavin' on a ghostly loom.
