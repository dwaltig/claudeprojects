**Title: "The Neon Mirage"**

(Verse 1)
The Good Lord said everything is a beautiful lie,
(Like a neon sign flashin' in a midnight sky)
It looks so solid, it looks so bright and clear,
But when you reach to touch it, baby, it just disappears.

(Verse 2)
If it’s all a hustle, tell me who’s gettin' played?
(Is it the dreamer or the dream that the devil made?)
It ain't about the swindle, it ain't about the scheme,
It’s just the empty nature of the whole damn scene.

(Verse 3)
You know it’s empty 'cause it’s always on the move,
(Like a scratchy record jumpin' out the groove)
If it was what it was, it would never, ever change,
But the world keeps shiftin', lookin' mighty strange.

(Verse 4)
How you gonna change if you’re already set in stone?
(Like a frozen statue sittin' on a throne)
But if you’re just a shadow with no nature of your own,
What is it that’s movin' through the skin and bone?

(Verse 5)
The milk don't turn to whiskey by stayin' the same,
(And it don't turn to whiskey by just changin' its name)
If they were truly different, they’d never, ever meet,
Change is a mystery walkin' down the street.

(Verse 6)
The young man ain't dyin' while he’s young and free,
(And the old man’s already what he’s gonna be)
So who is doin' the fadin', who is doin' the turn?
It’s a lonesome lesson that we all gotta learn.

(Verse 7)
If you had a "Something," you could have a "Nothin'" too,
(But the "Something" is a phantom that we’re lookin' through)
Emptiness ain't a thing you can put in your hand,
It’s just the shiftin' of the desert sand.

(Verse 8)
Emptiness is the medicine for every sick mind,
(The only way to leave all your troubles behind)
But if you fall in love with the cure and the pill,
Then you’re a dyin' man, baby, and you always will.
