## Verse 26.1
**punarbhavāya saṃskārān avidyānivṛtas tridhā |**
**abhisaṃskurute yāṃs taiḥ gatim gacchati karmabhiḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Obstructed by ignorance, one constructs the three kinds of formations (*saṃskāras*) for rebirth.
By those actions (*karma*), one goes to a destiny (*gati*)."

**Commentary**:
*   **Avidyā-nivṛtas** ("Obstructed by ignorance"): Ignorance of the Four Noble Truths. See **Chapter 24.18** regarding the antidote (Emptiness).
*   **Tridhā** ("Threefold"): Bodily, verbal, and mental formations.

## Verse 26.2
**vijñānaṃ saṃniviśate saṃskārapratyayaṃ gatau |**
**saṃniviṣṭe 'tha vijñāne nāmarūpaṃ niṣicyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Consciousness enters into a destiny, dependent on formations.
When consciousness has entered, name-and-form is infused."

**Commentary**:
*   **Vijñāna** ("Consciousness"): The linking consciousness (*pratisandhi-vijñāna*).
*   **Niṣicyate** ("Infused/Conceived"): The union of consciousness with the biological substrate (*nāmarūpa*).

## Verse 26.3
**niṣikte nāmarūpe tu ṣaḍāyatanasaṃbhavaḥ |**
**ṣaḍāyatanam āgamya saṃsparśaḥ saṃpravartate ||**

**Translation**:
"When name-and-form is infused, there is the arising of the six sense-spheres.
Depending on the six sense-spheres, contact proceeds."

**Commentary**:
*   **Ṣaḍāyatana** ("Six Spheres"): The five physical senses + the mind.

## Verse 26.4
**cakṣuḥ pratītya rūpaṃ ca samanvāhāram eva ca |**
**nāmarūpaṃ pratītyaivaṃ sparśaḥ pravartate ||**

**Translation**:
"Dependent on eye and form and attention,
And dependent on name-and-form, contact proceeds."

**Commentary**:
*   **Sparśa** ("Contact"): The tripartite meeting. See **Chapter 3 (*Cakṣurādi-parīkṣā*)** for the deconstruction of this contact.

**sthānaṃ sparśasya tatraiva vedanā tasya sambhavā |**
**vedanāpratyayā tṛṣṇā vedanārtham hi tṛṣyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Feeling arises there as the basis of contact.
Dependent on feeling is craving; for one craves for the sake of feeling."

**Commentary**:
*   **Vedanā** ("Feeling"): Pleasure, pain, or neutral.
*   **Tṛṣṇā** ("Craving"): The turning point. If one meets feeling with mindfulness instead of craving, the chain snaps.

**tṛṣyamāṇasya sopādānam upādāne pravartate |**
**upādānāt prabhavati bhavo bhoktuḥ pravartakāḥ ||**

From grasping, becoming arises; [these are] the instigators of the experiencer."

**jāteḥ saṃbhava ity evaṃ kevalasya mahātmanaḥ |**
**duḥkharāśeḥ samudayo deśitaḥ paramarṣiṇā ||**

"Thus is the arising of birth; and thus is the origin of this entire mass of suffering
Taught by the Supreme Sage."

**Commentary**:
*   **Duḥkha-rāśeḥ** ("Mass of suffering"): Emphasizing that there is no "Person" suffering, only a heap (*rāśi*) of suffering arising.

**duḥkhaskandhaḥ kevalo 'yam evaṃ samyag nirudhyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Through the cessation of each [preceding link], each [succeeding link] does not proceed.
Thus, this entire mass of suffering ceases completely."

**Commentary**:
*   **Pratiloma** ("Reverse Order"): This confirms that Samsara is a construct. If you remove the foundation (Ignorance), the building collapses.
