**Title: "Lookin' Through a Broken Glass"**

(Verse 1)
I fell in love with a picture in a magazine,
(Prettiest little thing that I ever seen)
But the love didn't come from the ink and the page,
It came from the hunger in my own ribcage.

(Verse 2)
You say it’s Beautiful, I say it’s Bad,
(The worst mistake that I ever had)
If the Beauty was real, like a diamond ring,
It wouldn't change into a ugly thing.

(Verse 6)
Everything you see, everything you touch,
(It don't amount to nothin' much)
It’s a Ghost City floatin' in the desert air,
You pack your bags, but nobody’s there.

(Verse 7)
Can a Reflection be dirty? Can a Shadow be clean?
(It’s just a trick of the light on the silver screen)
You scrub and you scrub 'til your fingers bleed,
But you can't wash the mud off a phantom steed.

(Verse 8)
You need the Ugly to know the Good,
(Like you need the rot to know the wood)
They lean on each other like two drunk friends,
Stumblin' down the road where the sidewalk ends.

(Verse 10)
If the Good ain't real, where’s the Love gonna go?
(Like a melted snowflake in the winter snow)
If the Bad ain't real, where’s the Hate gonna stay?
Just a bad dream waitin' for the break of day.

(Verse 13)
The Grabber and the Grabbed and the Grabbin' Hand,
(They all sink together in the quicksand)
When the struggle is over, and the fight is done,
You find out the battle was never begun.

(Verse 14)
Who’s the Fool lookin' through the broken glass?
(Watchin' the distorted shadows pass)
If there ain't no "Who," then there ain't no "Wrong,"
Just a skipped beat in a perfect song.

(Verse 21)
Turn off the projector, and the movie dies,
(Wipe the illusion from your tired eyes)
When the lie is gone, the truth breaks through,
And there ain't nothin' left to make you blue.

(Verse 25)
The Lust and the Hate and the Ignorance too,
(They ain't in the sky and they ain't in you)
They’re just bad weather passin' overhead,
Listen to what the Good Lord said.
