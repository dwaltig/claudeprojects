## Verse 24.1
**yadi śūnyam idaṃ sarvam udayo nāsti na vyayaḥ |**
**catūrṇām āryasatyānāṃ abhāvas te prasajyate ||**

**Translation**:
"If all this is empty, there is no arising and no passing away.
It follows that for you, the non-existence of the Four Noble Truths occurs."

**Commentary**:
*   **Prasaṅga** ("Consequence"): The opponent begins a devastating critique. If everything lacks intrinsic nature (*svabhāva*), then nothing can arise. If nothing arises, there is no "Suffering" (*Dukkha*), and thus the Four Noble Truths collapse.

---

## Verse 24.6
**śūnyatām upadhāryevaṃ sarvaṃ bādhasva tulyam |**
**sarvaṃ eva hi bādhasva śūnyatām upadhārayan ||**

**Translation**:
"By assuming emptiness in this way, you contradict everything.
Indeed, you contradict everything by assuming emptiness!"

**Commentary**:
*   **The Charge of Nihilism**: The opponent equates Emptiness (*śūnyatā*) with Nothingness (*abhāva*). To them, if a thing is "empty," it isn't there.

---

## Verse 24.7
**atra brūmaḥ na vijñāsi śūnyatāṃ śūnyatārthaṃ ca |**
**śūnyatāṃ śūnyatārthaṃ ca tata evaṃ vihanyase ||**

**Translation**:
"To this we say: You do not understand the purpose of emptiness, nor emptiness itself,
Nor the meaning of emptiness. Therefore, you are tormented in this way."

**Commentary**:
*   **Diagnosis**: Nāgārjuna identifies the category error. The opponent thinks Emptiness is a *denial* of reality, whereas it is actually the *condition* for reality.

---

## Verse 24.8
**dve satye samupāśritya buddhānāṃ dharmadeśanā |**
**lokasaṃvṛtisatyaṃ ca satyaṃ ca paramārthataḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"The teaching of the Dharma by the Buddhas relies on two truths:
The conventional truth of the world and the truth of the ultimate meaning."

**Commentary**:
*   **Loka-saṃvṛti-satya** ("Conventional Truth"): Literally "concealing truth" or "truth of the covering." This is the level of language, concepts, causality, and moral action. It is "true" because it functions reliably in the world, even though it is deceptive (like a reflection in a mirror).
*   **Paramārtha-satya** ("Ultimate Truth"): The realization that all conventional entities are empty of intrinsic nature. It is not a "higher reality" hiding behind the conventional, but the *nature* of the conventional itself.

---

## Verse 24.10
**vyavahāram anāśritya paramārtho na deśyate |**
**paramārtham anāgamaṃ nirvāṇaṃ nādhigamyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Without relying on everyday convention, the ultimate meaning is not taught.
Without approaching the ultimate meaning, Nirvana is not attained."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Ladder**: You cannot jump to the ultimate while ignoring the conventional. Emptiness doesn't destroy the Four Noble Truths; it provides the medium through which they function. If you ignore the medicine (conventional Dharma), you can't cure the disease (Suffering).

---

## Verse 24.11
**vināśayati durdṛṣṭā śūnyatā mandamedhasam |**
**sarpo yathā durgṛhīto vidyā vā duṣprasādhitā ||**

**Translation**:
"Emptiness, wrongly perceived, destroys a person of dull intelligence—
Like a snake grasped by the tail, or a spell wrongly cast."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Danger**: If you think Emptiness means "nothing matters" or "nothing exists," you fall into Nihilism (*uccheda-dṛṣṭi*). This is "grabbing the snake by the tail"—it turns around and bites you with spiritual despair or moral apathy.

---

## Verse 24.14
**sarvaṃ ca yujyate tasya śūnyatā yasya yujyate |**
**sarvaṃ na yujyate tasya śūnyata yasya na yujyate ||**

**Translation**:
"All is logical for him for whom emptiness is logical.
Nothing is logical for him for whom emptiness is not logical."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Great Turning**: This is the heart of the rebuttal. Only if things are Empty can they change, arise, and interact. If things had fixed *svabhāva*, they would be frozen forever. Emptiness is what makes the world work.

---

## Verse 24.18
**yaḥ pratītyasamutpādaḥ śūnyatāṃ tāṃ pracakṣmahe |**
**sā prajñaptir upādāya pratipat saiva madhyamā ||**

**Translation**:
"Whatever is dependent origination, that we explain as emptiness.
That is a dependent designation; that itself is the Middle Way."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Fourfold Equation**: This verse is the cornerstone of Madhyamaka thought. It equates four distinct concepts:
    1.  **Pratītyasamutpāda** (Dependent Origination): The way things arise.
    2.  **Śūnyatā** (Emptiness): The lack of intrinsic nature in things that arise dependently.
    3.  **Upādāya Prajñapti** (Dependent Designation): Concepts/names exist only in dependence on their basis.
    4.  **Madhyamā Pratipad** (Middle Way): Avoiding the extremes of Existence (Eternalism) and Non-existence (Nihilism).

## Verse 24.20
**yady aśūnyam idaṃ sarvam udayo nāsti na vyayaḥ |**
**catūrṇām āryasatyānāṃ abhāvas te prasajyate ||**

**Translation**:
"If all this were non-empty, there would be no arising and no passing away.
It follows that for you, the non-existence of the Four Noble Truths occurs."

**Commentary**:
*   **Mirror Rebuttal**: Nāgārjuna throws the opponent's first verse (24.1) back at them. If things had *nature* (were non-empty), they could never change. If they can't change, there is no path to liberation. It is the *Opponent* who destroys the Buddha's teaching!

---

## Verse 24.21
**apratītyasamutpannaṃ kuto duḥkhaṃ bhaviṣyati |**
**anityam uktam duḥkhaṃ hi tat svābhāve na vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Whence will there be suffering that is not dependently co-arisen?
For suffering is said to be impermanent; that [impermanence] does not exist in [intrinsic] nature."

**Commentary**:
*   **Suffering requires Emptiness**: If Suffering had a *svabhāva*, it would be permanent. We would suffer forever. It is precisely because Suffering is empty (dependent on causes like ignorance) that it can be brought to an end.

---

## Verse 24.31
**apratītya samutpannaṃ phalaṃ cet kva bhaviṣyati |**
**yo 'pratītyasamutpannaḥ sa dharmaḥ kva bhaviṣyati ||**

**Translation**:
"If the fruit were not dependently co-arisen, how could it exist?
Where will that Dharma exist which is not dependently co-arisen?"

**Commentary**:
*   **The Denial of Practice**: If the result of the path (Nirvana) was a fixed nature, no one could "attain" it, because attainment implies a transition from a state of non-attainment.

---

## Verse 24.36
**sarvasaṃvyavahārāṃś ca laukikān pratibādhasve |**
**yat pratītyasamutpādaśūnyatāṃ pratibādhasve ||**

**Translation**:
"You contradict all worldly conventions and practices
When you contradict the emptiness of dependent origination."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Reversal**: The Nihilist charge is flipped. It is the "Realist" (the believer in *svabhāva*) who is the true Nihilist, because his world is a collection of static, frozen entities that cannot interact or change.

---

## Verse 24.38
**akṛtaṃ cābhyupetaṃ syāt karma duḥkhaṃ ca śāśvatam |**
**svabhāvena sato nityaṃ na hi saṃsaratīsyate ||**

**Translation**:
"If [things] existed by intrinsic nature, they would be eternal and uncreated.
Action would be unperformed, and suffering would be eternal."

---

## Verse 24.40
**yaḥ pratītyasamutpādaṃ paśyatīdaṃ sa paśyati |**
**duḥkhaṃ samudayaṃ caiva nirodhaṃ mārgaṃ eva ca ||**

**Translation**:
"He who sees this dependent origination, he [truly] sees
Suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path."

**Commentary**:
*   **Conclusion**: To see the emptiness of things is not to deny the Noble Truths, but to see the only way they can possibly be true. Emptiness is the very "heartbeat" of the Buddha's message.
