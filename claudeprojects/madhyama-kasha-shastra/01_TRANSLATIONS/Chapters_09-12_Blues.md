# Chapters 9-12: Blues Translations

## Chapter 9: Before the Seein' (Pūrva-parīkṣā)

### The Trouble
Ain't nothin' hurts like chasin' a ghost. Folk lookin' for the *looker* 'fore the lookin' even starts, or huntin' for the *feeler* 'fore the feelin' hits. You can't catch your own shadow, brother. That chase'll leave you empty as a whiskey bottle on a Sunday mornin'.

### Key Verses

**9.1**
You ask 'bout the Seer 'fore the scene?
That's like askin' 'bout the thirst 'fore the mean, mean heat.
Can't have one without the other, honey—they just meet on the street.

**9.3**
If the eye itself is what you're seein',
Then what's the thing that's doin' the seein'?
You're spinnin' in a circle, chasin' your own tail in the rain.

**9.5**
No sight, no seer. No sound, no hearer.
Just the lonely, moanin' wind.
Ain't no *you* behind the blues, friend.
Just the blues beginnin' again.

### The Liberation
When you stop tryin' to find the singer behind the song, you realize you *are* the singin'. The weight of that lonely seeker drops off your shoulders like a broke-down shackle.

### Theological Notes

## Chapter 10: Fire and Fuel (Agnīndhana-parīkṣā)

### The Trouble
This here's the oldest blues duet: Fire and Fuel. They lean on each other so tight, you can't tell who's burnin' who. Think you're the fuel for your own desires? Or the fire of your own anger? That thinking's just more fire, needin' more fuel. It's a cycle that'll burn your whole house down.

### Key Verses

**10.1**
Can't have a fire without the wood,
Can't find wood that ain't smolderin' under the cover.
You say they're the same? That's burnin' yourself, brother.
You say they're different? Then how they find each other?

**10.8**
Fire don't wait for the fuel to come,
Fuel ain't sittin' there, waitin' to be burned.
They're born in the flame, together they hum,
No before, no after—just the lesson unlearned.

**10.14**
And this is you, friend, with your graspin' and yearnin'.
The self and the aggregates, leanin' and turnin'.
Can't find the "me" apart from the burnin'.
The whole damn thing is a co-arisin' concernin'.

### The Liberation
Stop asking which came first—the flame or the fuel. See that they don't *exist* apart, and the whole bonfire of grasping cools down to embers. You can tend the fire without bein' consumed by it.

### Theological Notes

| Blues Term | Sanskrit | Meaning |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Fire | Agni | The dependent phenomenon—desire, anger, the self |
| Fuel | Indhana | What "supports" fire—aggregates, conditions |
| Leanin' on Each Other | Itaretarāśraya | Mutual dependence that precludes inherent existence |

## Chapter 11: No Start, No Finish (Pūrvāparakoṭi-parīkṣā)

### The Trouble
You keep diggin' in the dirt for the first seed. You keep runnin' down the road for the last town. But the road don't end, and the seed was planted by another seed, and *that* one by another. You can't find the first note of the blues. It's been moanin' since before you were born.

### Key Verses

**11.1**
Saṃsāra's got no start you can find,
No "first heartbreak" sittin' at the head of the line.
The wheel's been turnin' since 'fore there was time,
And chasin' that beginning's just wastin' your prime.

**11.5**
You say "before I was born"—but who's the I in that phrase?
That I depends on *this* birth, and *this* on a maze
Of conditions and causes that go back for days and days.
You can't step outside the web to see the first blaze.

**11.8**
"Before" and "after" are labels we pin,
On a stream that don't know where it ends or begins.
The river just flows—let the concepts go thin,
And you'll find some peace in the roar and the din.

### The Liberation
Quit searchin' for the first cause. The freedom ain't in finding a beginning—it's in seeing there ain't one to find. The wheel turns, but you don't have to be pinned to it.

### Theological Notes

| Blues Term | Sanskrit | Meaning |
|------------|----------|---------|
| First Seed | Pūrvakoṭi | The fantasy of an inherent beginning |
| Last Town | Aparakoṭi | The fantasy of an inherent end |
| The Wheel | Saṃsāra | Cyclic existence—beginningless, endless, empty |

## Chapter 12: Where the Sufferin' Come From? (Duḥkha-parīkṣā)

### The Trouble
When the hurt hits, you point fingers. At yourself, at the world, at both, or just at the cruel, empty sky. But blamin' just builds another prison. The question itself is a trapdoor—step on it, and you fall right back into the cellar of "me" and "mine."

### Key Verses

**12.1**
Does the hurt come from inside or out?
That's what all the worryin's about.
But the knife can't cut itself, and the wound can't just shout.

**12.5**
"From both," you say? That's twice the chain.
"From neither"? That's just the rain with no pain.
All four doors lead back to the same old lane.

**12.10**
When you see the empty nature of the one who's sore,
Them four questions just don't haunt your door no more.
The sufferin' arises, dependent, and don't come from nothin' you can keep score.

### The Liberation
You stop bein' a detective on the case of your own pain. Seein' it arise like weather—dependent, empty, impersonal—lets the storm pass through without buildin' a home for it.

### Theological Notes

| Blues Term | Sanskrit | Meaning |
|------------|----------|---------|
| Pointin' Fingers | Catuṣkoṭi | The four alternatives: self, other, both, neither |
| The Cellar | Satkāyadṛṣṭi | The view of a real, inherent self |
| Weather | Pratītyasamutpāda | Dependent arising—suffering without a solid source |

**Final Chord:**
The blues ain't in the guitar, the throat, or the hurt. It's in the space *between* 'em. Find that empty, singin' space, and you're free.
