## Verse 23.1
**saṃkalpaprabhavo rāgo dveso mohaś ca kathyate |**
**śubhāśubhaviparyāsān saṃbhavanti pratītya hi ||**

**Translation**:
"Lust, hatred, and delusion are said to arise from conceptualization.
They arise dependent on perversions regarding the beautiful and the repulsive."

**Commentary**:
*   **Saṃkalpa** ("Conceptualization/Fantasy"): Defilements do not come from the object itself, but from our mental fabrication about the object.
*   **Viparyāsa** ("Perversion/Inversion"): Seeing the impermanent as eternal, painful as pleasurable, impure as pure, and non-self as self.

---

## Verse 23.2
**śubhāśubhaviparyāsāḥ saṃbhavanti pratītya ye |**
**te svabhāvān na vidyante tasmāt kleśā na tattvataḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Those perversions regarding the beautiful and repulsive which arise dependently—
They do not exist by intrinsic nature. Therefore, defilements do not exist in reality."

**Commentary**:
*   **Na tattvataḥ** ("Not in reality"): The error is not just that we see the object wrongly; the error is thinking there is an "object" at all. Since the object of lust (e.g., a body) is empty of *svabhāva*, the perversion is an error about a phantom.

## Verse 23.6
**rūpaśabdarasasparśā gandhā dharmāś ca kevalāḥ |**
**gandharvanagarākārā marīcisvapnasaṃnibhāḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Form, sound, taste, touch, smell, and mental objects entirely—
Are like a city of Gandharvas, resembling a mirage or a dream."

**Commentary**:
*   **Gandharva-nagara**: A stock image for an illusion. If the object of lust (e.g., a beautiful body) is a mirage, then the lust itself is like thirsting for phantom water.

## Verse 23.7
**aśubhaṃ vā śubhaṃ vāpi kutas teṣu bhaviṣyati |**
**māyāpuruṣakalpeṣu pratibimbasameṣu ca ||**

**Translation**:
"How will the repulsive or the beautiful exist in them—
Which are like illusory men and resemble reflections?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Māyā-puruṣa** ("Magical Creation"): You cannot say a reflection in a mirror is "clean" or "dirty" in reality; it has no substance to hold the quality. The ontological emptiness of the substrate precludes the predication of "purity" or "impurity."

## Verse 23.8
**anāpekṣya śubhaṃ nāsty aśubhaṃ prajñapayemahi |**
**yat pratītya śubhaṃ tasmāc chubhaṃ naivopapadyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Without depending on the beautiful, the repulsive does not exist—[so] we designate [the repulsive].
Therefore, the beautiful which depends on [the repulsive] does not logically obtain."

**Commentary**:
*   **Mutual Dependence**: "Beautiful" only makes sense in contrast to "Ugly." If A needs B to exist, A is not self-existent. Beauty is relative, not intrinsic.

---

## Verse 23.13
**yena gṛhṇāti yo grāho gṛhītā yacca gṛhyate |**
**upaśāntāni sarvāṇi tasmād grāho na vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"That by which one grasps, the grasping, the grasper, and that which is grasped—
All are pacified. Therefore, grasping is not found."

**Commentary**:
*   **Upaśānta** ("Pacified/Extinguished"): In Emptiness, the subject-object duality dissolves. No Grasper = No Grasping = No Perversion.

---

## Verse 23.14
**avidyamāne grāhe ca mithyā vā samyag eva vā |**
**bhavet kasya viparyāsaḥ kasya vāviparyayaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"And when grasping does not exist, whether false or correct—
Of whom will there be perversion? Or of whom will there be non-perversion?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Kasya** ("Of whom?"): Perversion implies a Person who is perverted. But the Person (*ātman*) was refuted in Chapter 18.

---

## Verse 23.21
**evam nirudhyate 'vidyā viparyāsanirodhanāt |**
**avidyāyāṃ niruddhāyāṃ saṃskārādyam nirudhyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Thus, ignorance ceases due to the cessation of perversions.
When ignorance has ceased, compounded phenomena and the rest cease."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Chain Reaction**: Seeing Emptiness stops Perversion -> stops Ignorance -> stops Karma -> stops Birth/Death. This is the logic of the Third Noble Truth (*Nirodha*).

## Verse 23.25
**rāgadveṣamohāś caivaṃ na santi paramārthataḥ |**
**kleśāś ca karmaṇaś caiva dehe santi na dehinām ||**

**Translation**:
"Thus lust, hatred, and delusion do not exist ultimately.
Defilements and actions are not in the body, nor in the embodied ones."

**Commentary**:
*   **Paramārthataḥ** ("Ultimately"): Conventionally, we treat lust with antidotes. Ultimately, we see it never arose.
