**Title: "The I.O.U. Blues"**

(Verse 1)
Be kind to your neighbor, keep your mind real cool,
(Don't be actin' crazy, don't be actin' like a fool)
That’s the seed you plantin', deep in the ground,
Gonna grow a sweet apple when the harvest comes round.

(Verse 2)
The Prophet said Karma is the will and the deed,
(It’s the thought in your head and the hunger you feed)
There’s a thousand ways to do it, a thousand ways to fall,
But the thought is the trigger that starts it all.

(Verse 6)
If the deed stays forever, it’s a heavy, heavy stone,
(Like a unwanted guest who won't leave you alone)
But if the deed disappears like smoke in the air,
How’s it gonna find you when the cupboard is bare?

(Verse 7-11)
You say it’s like a seed turnin' into a sprout,
(A long green line that snakes all about)
But if the seed is gone when the fruit appears,
Why am I cryin' for a sin from yesteryears?

(Verse 13-14)
So you invented a ghost called "The Imperishable One,"
(Like a shadow that stays when the day is done)
It’s a I.O.U. note in the bank of the sky,
Says "You owe me, baby" until the day you die.

(Verse 15)
You say the action fades but the debt stays true,
(Like a stain on the collar of a shirt written "You")
You tryin' to fix the hole in the bottom of the sack,
With a patch made of dreams that you can't give back.

(Verse 20)
If the debt was real, like a rock or a tree,
(It would last forever, through eternity)
You’d never pay it off, you’d never be free,
Just a lifer in the prison of history.

(Verse 21)
If the Doer is real, he’s gotta stay the same,
(Can't change his face, can't change his name)
But if he don't change, he can't feel the pain,
You can't get wet if you ain't in the rain.

(Verse 22)
We want the sweet fruit, we run from the sour,
(Chasin' the pleasure, hour after hour)
But if the fruit was locked inside the seed,
The hunger and the feast would be the same damn deed.

(Verse 23)
It ain't natural, baby, it’s just a masquerade,
(A costume party that the devil made)
If it was Real Nature, it would stand alone,
But everything I see is just a loan.

(Verse 24-25)
The Sin ain't in the body, the Sin ain't in the soul,
(It ain't in the part, and it ain't in the whole)
It’s like a City in the Clouds, shinin' in the sun,
You walk towards the gate, and it comes undone.

(Verse 27)
We spinnin' a web, but the spider is gone,
(The music is playin', but it ain't no song)
Samsara is a engine runnin' on no gas,
Waitin' for a future that will never pass.

(Verse 30)
It’s like a Magic Man puttin' on a show,
(Pullin' rabbits from a hat in a long, dark row)
The Magician makes a Puppet, and the Puppet makes a scene,
And neither one knows what the drama really means.

(Verse 31)
I’m the Puppet, baby, and my Deed is the Act,
(That’s the cold, hard, illusory fact)
I’m a shadow cast by nothin' on a wall of smoke,
Laughin' at the punchline of a cosmic joke.

(Verse 33)
The Debt ain't real, but you still gotta pay,
(That’s the riddle of the Blues, what can I say?)
It’s a Dream within a Dream, a Mirage in the sand,
But you still gotta walk it like a natural man.
