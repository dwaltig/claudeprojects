### Candrakīrti's Opening Invocation

*Verses 1-4: Homage to Mañjuśrī and Nāgārjuna*

> To Mañjuśrī, the youthful prince, I bow—  
> He who, his dwelling purified from clinging to extremes,¹  
> Born from the ocean of the Perfectly Awakened One,  
> With compassion taught the profound nature of the true Dharma waters.²

> Up to this day, the rays of his vision  
> Burn the fuel of rival doctrines—  
> And also burn the darkness in the minds  
> Of beings in this world.³

> His flood of words of incomparable wisdom  
> Sweeps away the entire army of cyclic existence,⁴  
> Bringing to trainable beings, together with the gods,  
> The royal splendor of the three realms.

> Having bowed to that Nāgārjuna,  
> I shall compose a commentary on his verses—  
> The *Prasannapadā* ("Clear Words"), joined with easy explanation,  
> Undisturbed by the winds of logic.⁵

## Preface to the Text

Candrakīrti explains the *sambandha* (connection), *abhidheya* (subject matter), and *prayojana* (purpose) of the treatise:

**Subject Matter** (*abhidheya*): Dependent origination (*pratītyasamutpāda*) characterized by the eight negations—non-cessation, non-arising, non-annihilation, non-permanence, not-one-meaning, not-different-meanings, non-coming, and non-going.⁶

**Purpose** (*prayojana*): Nirvāṇa, characterized by the pacification of all conceptual proliferation (*sarva-prapañcopashama*).⁷

## Kārikā 1-2: The Dedication Verses

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> anirodham anutpādam anucchedam aśāśvatam |  
> anekārtham anānārtham anāgamam anirgamam ||1||  
>
> yaḥ pratītyasamutpādaṃ prapañcopaśamaṃ śivam |  
> deśayāmāsa saṃbuddhas taṃ vande vadatāṃ varam ||2||

### Translation:

> **[1]** Neither ceasing nor arising,⁸  
> Neither annihilated nor permanent,  
> Neither one in meaning nor different in meaning,  
> Neither coming nor going—

> **[2]** He who taught dependent origination,  
> The pacification of proliferation, the auspicious—  
> That fully awakened one, the best of speakers,  
> Him I venerate.⁹

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

Candrakīrti notes that cessation (*nirodha*) is mentioned before arising (*utpāda*) to demonstrate that there is no fixed order—it is not the case that arising must come first and cessation later. As he will state: "If there were birth first, then decay and death later, birth would be without aging and death—one would be born immortal!"¹⁰

The eight negations are applied to dependent origination to show its true nature as perceived by noble beings (*ārya*). These negations refute the eight corresponding wrong views.

## Kārikā 3: The Tetralemma (Catuṣkoṭi)

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> na svato nāpi parato na dvābhyāṃ nāpy ahetutaḥ |  
> utpannā jātu vidyante bhāvāḥ kvacana kecana ||3||

### Translation:

> **[3]** Not from self, not from other,  
> Not from both, and not without cause—  
> Never anywhere are there  
> Any entities that have arisen.¹¹

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

This verse refutes the four possible modes of arising, directed at four opponent schools:¹²

| Position | Sanskrit | Proponent |
|:---------|:---------|:----------|
| From self (*svataḥ*) | स्वतः | Sāṃkhya |
| From other (*parataḥ*) | परतः | Naiyāyika, Buddhist realists |
| From both (*dvābhyām*) | द्वाभ्याम् | Jaina |
| Without cause (*ahetukaḥ*) | अहेतुकः | Cārvāka/Lokāyata |

Candrakīrti cites Ācārya Buddhapālita's commentary: "Entities do not arise from themselves because:
1. Their arising would be purposeless (*vaiyarthya*)—if they already exist, why arise again?
2. There would be infinite regress—if what exists arises, it would arise again and again without end."¹³

**The Prasaṅgika Method**: Candrakīrti defends Buddhapālita against Bhāviveka's criticism. The Mādhyamika need not construct independent inferences (*svatantra-anumāna*) with universally accepted premises. Instead, the opponent's position is refuted through *prasaṅga*—showing the absurd consequences that follow from their own assumptions.¹⁴

As Āryadeva states:
> "For one who has no thesis—  
> Neither existent, non-existent, both existent and non-existent, nor neither—  
> Even after a long time,  
> No objection can be stated."¹⁵

### Footnotes

¹ **[Sanskrit]** *antadvayāvāsavidhūtavāsaḥ* — "whose dwelling is purified from the abode of the two extremes" (eternalism and nihilism).

² **[Cross-reference]** This invocation style mirrors Candrakīrti's *Madhyamakāvatāra* opening.

³ **[Philosophical]** The "rival doctrines" (*paravādimatam*) are principally the Hindu schools (Sāṃkhya, Nyāya, Vaiśeṣika) and non-Mādhyamaka Buddhist schools.

⁴ **[Sanskrit]** *bhavāri-senām* — "the army of the enemy that is cyclic existence."

⁵ **[Dialectical]** *tarkānilānākulitām* — "undisturbed by the winds of logic" signals that this commentary prioritizes scriptural over purely rational approaches.

⁶ **[Philosophical]** These "eight negations" (*aṣṭa-viśeṣaṇa*) are the defining characteristics of dependent origination as understood by the Mādhyamika. Each negation refutes a corresponding wrong view.

⁷ **[Cross-reference]** Cf. MMK 18.9: *prapañcopaśamaśivam* — "the pacification of proliferation, the auspicious."

⁸ **[Sanskrit]** Note Nāgārjuna places *anirodha* (non-cessation) before *anutpāda* (non-arising), reversing the expected causal order.

⁹ **[Historical]** *vadatāṃ varam* — "best of speakers" is a standard epithet for the Buddha, emphasizing his skill in teaching (*upāya-kauśalya*).

¹⁰ **[Cross-reference]** MMK 11.3 — this verse will be examined in the chapter on *Pūrvāparakoṭi-parīkṣā* (Beginning and End).

¹¹ **[Sanskrit]** *jātu* = "at any time"; *kvacana* = "anywhere"; *kecana* = "any whatsoever." The triple indefinites emphasize absolute universality of the negation.

¹² **[Dialectical]** This verse establishes the structure for the entire chapter. Each of the four positions will be refuted in sequence.

¹³ **[Historical]** Buddhapālita (ca. 5th-6th c.) was Candrakīrti's main predecessor in the Prāsaṅgika lineage.

¹⁴ **[Philosophical]** This is the central methodological distinction between Prāsaṅgika and Svātantrika Mādhyamaka. Bhāviveka criticized Buddhapālita for not providing independent proofs; Candrakīrti here defends the *prasaṅga* (consequence) method.

¹⁵ **[Cross-reference]** *Catuḥśataka* 16.25. This verse is also cited in *Vigrahavyāvartanī* 29-30.

---

### Key Concepts

- **pratītyasamutpāda** (प्रतीत्यसमुत्पाद): Dependent origination. From *pratītya* (having depended) + *samutpāda* (arising together). Candrakīrti specifically rejects the alternative etymology that would derive it from "arising of that which is repeatedly perishing."

- **svabhāva** (स्वभाव): Own-nature, intrinsic nature, self-existence. This is what Mādhyamaka negates—the notion that entities exist by virtue of their own nature, independently of causes and conditions.

- **prasaṅga** (प्रसङ्ग): Consequence, absurd conclusion. The Prāsaṅgika method shows that the opponent's position leads to unwanted consequences, without the Mādhyamika needing to assert any positive thesis.

## Kārikā 4: The Four Conditions

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> catvāraḥ pratyayā hetur ālambanam anantaram |  
> tathaivādhipateyyaṃ ca pratyayo nāsti pañcamaḥ ||4||

### Translation:

> **[4]** The four conditions are: the cause (*hetu*),  
> The object-support (*ālambana*), the immediately preceding (*anantara*),  
> And likewise the dominant condition (*adhipati*)—  
> There is no fifth condition.¹⁶

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

An objection is raised: "The Blessed One himself taught that entities arise from conditions in the form of 'other'! As the Buddha declared:

> *Four are the conditions: cause, object-support, immediately-preceding,  
> And dominant. There is no fifth condition.*

Candrakīrti explains each:
- **Hetu-pratyaya** (causal condition): That which, established in the mode of a seed, is the cause of something
- **Ālambana-pratyaya** (object-condition): That by which an arising dharma arises—its object
- **Anantara-pratyaya** (immediately-preceding condition): The cessation of the cause immediately preceding the arising of the effect (as the cessation of the seed immediately precedes the sprout)
- **Adhipati-pratyaya** (dominant condition): Whatever, when present, allows something to occur

Other conditions (prior-born, simultaneous, subsequent) are included within these four. But conditions such as God (*īśvara*) are impossible—hence "there is no fifth condition."¹⁷

---

## Kārikā 5: No Intrinsic Nature in Conditions

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> na hi svabhāvo bhāvānāṃ pratyayādiṣu vidyate |  
> avidyamāne svabhāve parabhāvo na vidyate ||5||

### Translation:

> **[5]** For no intrinsic nature (*svabhāva*) of entities  
> Is found in conditions and so forth.  
> When intrinsic nature does not exist,  
> Other-nature (*parabhāva*) is not found.¹⁸

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

This is the Mādhyamika response: If the intrinsic nature of effects (shoots, etc.) existed—even prior to arising—in the conditions (seeds, etc.), whether taken together, separately, or both together and separately, or somewhere else, then arising from them would be possible. But there is no such prior existence.¹⁹

Furthermore: if the effect already existed in the conditions prior to arising, the arising would be purposeless. Therefore, entities have no intrinsic nature in conditions.

Without *svabhāva*, there can be no *parabhāva* (other-nature). For "otherness" requires two existing things in mutual relation. But seed and sprout are never simultaneous—when the seed exists, the sprout does not; when the sprout exists, the seed has ceased.²⁰

---

## Kārikā 6: The Problem with "Action" (*kriyā*)

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> kriyā na pratyayavatī nāpratyayavatī kriyā |  
> pratyayā nākriyāvantaḥ kriyāvantaś ca santy uta ||6||

### Translation:

> **[6]** Action is not condition-possessing,  
> Nor is action without conditions.  
> Conditions are not without action,  
> Nor are they possessed of action.²¹

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

An objector argues: "Perhaps it's not the conditions (eye, form, etc.) that directly produce consciousness, but rather an *action* (*kriyā*) that is condition-dependent which produces consciousness—as cooking-action produces rice."

Candrakīrti responds: If there were some action, and if it possessed conditions (eye, etc.), then it might produce consciousness. But there is none. Why? Because an action would have to occur either when consciousness is already arisen, not yet arisen, or currently arising—and none of these are coherent.²²

---

## Kārikā 7: Entities Are Not "Made" by Conditions

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> utpadyate pratītyemān itīme pratyayāḥ kila |  
> yāvan notpadyata ime tāvan nāpratyayāḥ kathaṃ ||7||

### Translation:

> **[7]** "This arises depending on these"—  
> Thus these are said to be conditions.  
> As long as this has not arisen,  
> Why are they not non-conditions?²³

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

If the effect has not yet arisen, on what basis can the conditions be called "conditions"? A condition is defined relationally—as that on which something depends. But if the dependent entity does not yet exist, the relation cannot be established.²⁴

---

## Kārikā 8: Neither Existent Nor Non-Existent Effects

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> naivāsato naiva sataḥ pratyayo 'rthasya yujyate |  
> asataḥ pratyayaḥ kasya sataś ca pratyayena kim ||8||

### Translation:

> **[8]** Neither for a non-existent thing nor for an existent thing  
> Is a condition appropriate.  
> Of what non-existent thing could there be a condition?  
> And for what is existent, what use is a condition?²⁵

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

This verse presents a dilemma:
- If the effect doesn't exist, what would a condition be a condition *of*? You cannot cause the non-existent.
- If the effect already exists, what need is there of conditions? The work is already done.

In neither case can conditions meaningfully function.²⁶

---

## Kārikā 9: The Non-Arising of Dharmas

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> na san nāsan na sadasan dharmo nirvartate yadā |  
> kathaṃ nirvartako hetur evaṃ sati hi yujyate ||9||

### Translation:

> **[9]** When a dharma does not come to be  
> As existent, non-existent, or both,  
> How can there be a productive cause?  
> For [only] if it were so would [causation] be appropriate.²⁷

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

The trilemma: Does the dharma being produced exist, not exist, or both?
- If existent, production is pointless
- If non-existent, production is impossible (like a sky-flower)
- If both, the contradiction is manifest

Since none of these alternatives work, how can we speak of a "productive cause"?²⁸

---

## Kārikā 10: The Problem with "Object" (*ālambana*)

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> asan nimittaṃ nirvṛtter ālambanam iti kriyā |  
> anālambā prasajyeta nāsty anālambanā kriyā ||10||

### Translation:

> **[10]** [If you say] a non-existent is the cause of production,  
> [And] the object-support is "the action,"  
> Then action without object-support would follow—  
> But there is no action without object-support.²⁹

---

## Kārikā 11: Effects Not In Conditions

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> asatsv eva pratyayeṣu phalaṃ yadi na vidyate |  
> pratyayebhyaḥ phalaṃ kac ca nāpratyayebhya āvrajet ||11||

### Translation:

> **[11]** If the effect is not found  
> Existing in the conditions,  
> Then whence would the effect come  
> From conditions—or from non-conditions?³⁰

---

## Kārikā 12: Conditions Neither Produce Nor Not-Produce

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> athāsti phalam etebhyaḥ pratyayebhyaḥ pravartate |  
> pratyayebhyaḥ kim āyātaṃ phalaṃ na pratyayātmakam ||12||

### Translation:

> **[12]** If the effect exists and proceeds  
> From these conditions,  
> Why does it not come from non-conditions—  
> Since the effect is not of the nature of conditions?³¹

---

## Kārikā 13: Effect Neither Contains Nor Lacks Condition-Nature

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> pratyayātmakaṃ phalaṃ pratyayāś cāsvayaṃbhuvaḥ |  
> asvabhāveṣu bhāveṣu svabhāvaḥ kuta eva hi ||13||

### Translation:

> **[13]** The effect is of condition-nature,  
> And conditions are not self-arisen.  
> In entities lacking intrinsic nature,  
> From where indeed would intrinsic nature come?³²

---

## Kārikā 14: Conclusion—Neither Existent Nor Non-Existent

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> tasmān na phalam etebhyaḥ pratyayebhyaḥ pravartate |  
> na cāpratyayato 'py asti phalavat pratyayāḥ kutaḥ ||14||

### Translation:

> **[14]** Therefore, the effect does not proceed  
> From these conditions.  
> Nor does it exist apart from conditions—  
> So from where would there be condition-possessing [effects]?³³

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

This concludes the examination of conditions. The effect does not arise from conditions (for it is not found in them), nor does it arise without conditions (for that would make causation meaningless). The chapter has shown that the four conditions—when analyzed—cannot establish causal production with intrinsic nature.³⁴

## Scholarly Apparatus (Continued)

### Footnotes (16-34)

¹⁶ **[Dialectical]** The four pratyayas are standard Abhidharma categories. Nāgārjuna accepts them provisionally (*saṃvṛti*) to refute them philosophically (*paramārtha*).

¹⁷ **[Historical]** The exclusion of a "fifth condition" (such as *īśvara*, God) refutes the Naiyāyika position that a divine creator is a necessary condition for arising.

¹⁸ **[Sanskrit]** *parabhāva* — "other-nature" or "nature-from-other." This is the key target of the *parataḥ utpatti* refutation.

¹⁹ **[Dialectical]** This argument parallels the refutation of *svataḥ utpatti*: if the effect pre-existed in the conditions, production would be redundant.

²⁰ **[Cross-reference]** This temporal asymmetry argument is developed extensively in Chapter 2 (Gatagata-parīkṣā).

²¹ **[Philosophical]** A tetralemma applied to action: action with conditions, without conditions, conditions with action, conditions without action—all fail.

²² **[Dialectical]** The three-time analysis (past, present, future) that will structure Chapter 2 appears here embryonically.

²³ **[Sanskrit]** *kila* — "so it is said," "allegedly"—Nāgārjuna signals he is reporting the opponent's view, not endorsing it.

²⁴ **[Philosophical]** This is the problem of relational definition: "condition" is defined in relation to "conditioned," but if only one relatum exists, the relation fails.

²⁵ **[Modern]** Cf. the problem of the pre-established harmony in Leibniz—if everything is already set, what work does causation do?

²⁶ **[Dialectical]** Note the dilemma form: both horns are refuted, leaving no coherent middle ground for the opponent.

²⁷ **[Sanskrit]** *nirvartaka* — "productive," "bringing about." From √vṛt (to turn, to act).

²⁸ **[Cross-reference]** This trilemma appears in multiple chapters—cf. MMK 7.20, 12.9, 21.15.

²⁹ **[Philosophical]** The problem of intentionality: consciousness requires an object (*ālambana*), but if that object doesn't exist prior to consciousness, what is consciousness of?

³⁰ **[Dialectical]** A *prasaṅga* argument: if from conditions, why not also from non-conditions? The distinction collapses.

³¹ **[Sanskrit]** *pratyayātmaka* — "having conditions as one's nature." If effect = conditions, they are identical; if not, the connection is arbitrary.

³² **[Philosophical]** The chain: effects depend on conditions → conditions are not self-arisen → therefore neither has *svabhāva* → therefore no *svabhāva* anywhere.

³³ **[Cross-reference]** This verse formally concludes the pratyaya analysis. The chapter continues with further examination of production.

³⁴ **[Historical]** Candrakīrti notes that this refutation applies equally to all opponent schools who assert production with intrinsic nature, whether Buddhist Sarvāstivādins or non-Buddhist schools.

---

### Key Concepts (Chapter 1)

- **pratyaya** (प्रत्यय): Condition. The four standard conditions analyzed and deconstructed.
- **hetu** (हेतु): Cause proper, the "seed" condition.
- **ālambana** (आलम्बन): Object-support, what consciousness is "of."
- **anantara** (अनन्तर): Immediately-preceding condition—the prior moment whose cessation allows the next.
- **adhipati** (अधिपति): Dominant condition—whatever allows an effect when present.
- **kriyā** (क्रिया): Action, activity. Refuted as an intermediary between conditions and effects.
- **nirvartaka** (निर्वर्तक): Productive, bringing about—the supposed power of causes.

### Argument Summary

| Thesis Refuted | Method | Result |
|:---------------|:-------|:-------|
| Self-origination (*svataḥ*) | Redundancy + infinite regress | Refuted |
| Other-origination (*parataḥ*) | No svabhāva in pratyayas | Refuted |
| Both (*dvābhyām*) | Combines both errors | Refuted |
| Causeless (*ahetukaḥ*) | Chaos would follow | Refuted |

### Soul Check Hints for Bluesman

**Blues Translation Guidance:**

1. **Verse 3 - The Tetralemma**: "Can't be you made yourself, can't be something else made you, can't be both, can't be nothing—so what was it that brought you here, friend?"

2. **Verse 5 - No svabhāva in conditions**: "You keep looking in the seed for the flower, but ain't no flower hiding in there."

3. **Verse 8 - Dilemma of existent/non-existent**: "If it ain't there, how you gonna cause it? If it's already there, what you causing?"

4. **Verse 14 - Conclusion**: "So the chain ain't really chained to nothing, and that's the first step to being free."

5. **The Four Conditions**: Like four promises the world makes—but when you really look, ain't none of them got what they promised.

# Chapter 2: Gatagata-parīkṣā (गतागतपरीक्षा)
# Examination of Motion

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

---

## Introduction

Having refuted arising (*utpāda*) in Chapter 1, Nāgārjuna now examines motion (*gati*) to demonstrate that the characteristic of "non-coming and non-going" (*anāgama-anirgama*) applies to dependent origination. If motion—the most evident of phenomena—cannot withstand analysis, then no phenomenon possesses inherent nature.

---

## Kārikā 1: The Trilemma of Motion

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> gataṃ na gamyate tāvad agataṃ naiva gamyate |  
> gatāgatavinirmuktaṃ gamyamānaṃ na gamyate ||1||

### Translation:

> **[1]** What has been traversed (*gata*) is not being traversed;  
> What has not been traversed (*agata*) is certainly not being traversed.  
> Apart from what has been traversed and what has not been traversed,  
> What is being traversed (*gamyamāna*) is not being traversed.¹

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

The "gone-to" (*gata*) is that in which the action of going has ceased. The "being-gone-to" (*gamyamāna*) is that which is currently pervaded by the action of going. Since the "gone-to" has already exhausted its going-action, saying it "is being gone-to" is contradictory.²

The "not-yet-gone-to" (*agata*) has no going-action yet begun. But "is being traversed" (*gamyate*) is a present participle. Since past and present, future and present, are mutually exclusive, neither can be said to "be being traversed."

As for the "being-traversed"—this is examined separately and found not to exist apart from *gata* and *agata*.³

---

## Kārikā 2: The Opponent's Objection

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> ceṣṭā yatra gatis tatra gamyamāne ca sā yataḥ |  
> na gate nāgate ceṣṭā gamyamāne gatis tataḥ ||2||

### Translation:

> **[2]** "Where there is activity (*ceṣṭā*), there is motion.  
> And since that [activity] is in the being-traversed,  
> Not in the gone-to, not in the not-gone-to,  
> Therefore motion is in the being-traversed."⁴

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

The opponent argues: Activity—defined as the lifting and placing of feet—exists in the "being-traversed" space. It is not in the "gone-to" (already passed) nor in the "not-gone-to" (not yet reached). Therefore, motion exists and is located in the *gamyamāna*.⁵

---

## Kārikā 3: The Problem of Double Motion

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> gamyamānasya gamanaṃ kathaṃ nāmopapadyate |  
> gamyamāne dvigamanaṃ yadā naivopapadyate ||3||

### Translation:

> **[3]** How can motion of the being-traversed be established  
> When double motion in the being-traversed  
> Is entirely impossible?⁶

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

The designation "being-traversed" (*gamyamāna*) itself requires a going-action. If you then say this being-traversed "is being traversed" (*gamyate*), you require a second going-action. But there is only one action of going—it is already used up in the designation *gamyamāna*. Hence, *gamyamāne gamyate* requires two goings where only one exists.⁷

---

## Kārikā 4: Motion Without Action

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> gamyamānasya gamanaṃ yasya tasya prasajyate |  
> ṛte gater gamyamānaṃ gamyamānaṃ hi gamyate ||4||

### Translation:

> **[4]** For whomever there is motion of the being-traversed,  
> It follows that there would be  
> A being-traversed without motion—  
> For the being-traversed is [said to be] traversed.⁸

---

## Kārikā 5: Double Motion, Double Goer

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> gamyamānasya gamane prasaktaṃ gamanadvaymam |  
> yena tad gamyamānaṃ ca yac cātra gamanaṃ punaḥ ||5||

### Translation:

> **[5]** If there is motion of the being-traversed,  
> Double motion follows:  
> That by which it is "being-traversed,"  
> And again, that motion which [you say] is here.⁹

---

## Kārikā 6: Double Motion Requires Double Goer

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> dvau gantārau prasajyete prasakte gamanadvaye |  
> gantāraṃ hi tiraskṛtya gamanaṃ nopapadyate ||6||

### Translation:

> **[6]** If double motion follows,  
> Two goers would follow.  
> For without a goer,  
> Motion is not established.¹⁰

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

Action necessarily requires an agent (*kartṛ*). Going-action requires a goer. If there are two goings, there must be two goers. But in one Devadatta who is walking, there is not a second agent. Therefore, there cannot be double motion—and hence "the being-traversed is being traversed" is incoherent.¹¹

---

## Kārikā 7: No Goer Without Going

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> gantāraṃ cet tiraskṛtya gamanaṃ nopapadyate |  
> gamane 'sati gantātha kuta eva bhaviṣyati ||7||

### Translation:

> **[7]** If without a goer motion is not established,  
> Then in the absence of motion,  
> From where will a goer come to be?¹²

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

The goer depends on going, and going depends on the goer. Neither can be established first. This is the mutual dependence (*anyonyāśraya*) that undermines both.¹³

---

## Kārikā 8: The Trilemma of the Goer

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> gantā na gacchati tāvad agantā naiva gacchati |  
> anyo ganturgantṛuś ca kas tṛtīyo hi gacchati ||8||

### Translation:

> **[8]** The goer does not go;  
> The non-goer certainly does not go.  
> What third [entity] other than goer and non-goer  
> Goes?¹⁴

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

The "goer" (*gantṛ*) is defined as one who possesses going-action. But if he *already* possesses it, what more does "he goes" add? The non-goer, by definition, lacks going-action—so he certainly doesn't go. And there is no third option.¹⁵

---

## Kārikā 9-11: Further Analysis of Goer and Going

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> gantā tāvad gacchatīti katham evopapadyate |  
> gamanena vinā gantā yadā naivopapadyate ||9||

### Translation:

> **[9]** How can "the goer goes" be established  
> When without motion  
> A goer is entirely impossible?¹⁶

---

> pakṣo gantā gacchatīti yasya tasya prasajyate |  
> gamanena vinā gantā ganturgamanam icchataḥ ||10||

### Translation:

> **[10]** For whomever holds the position "the goer goes,"  
> It follows that there would be  
> A goer without motion—  
> For one who wants the goer to possess motion.¹⁷

---

> gamane dve prasajyete gantā yady uta gacchati |  
> ganteti cocyate yena gantā san yac ca gacchati ||11||

### Translation:

> **[11]** If a goer goes,  
> Double motion follows:  
> That by which he is called "goer,"  
> And—being a goer—that which he goes.¹⁸

---

## Kārikā 12-14: No Beginning of Motion

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> gate nārabhyate gantuṃ gantuṃ nārabhyate 'gate |  
> nārabhyate gamyamāne gantum ārabhyate kuha ||12||

### Translation:

> **[12]** In the gone-to, going is not begun;  
> In the not-gone-to, going is not begun;  
> In the being-gone-to, going is not begun—  
> Where then is going begun?¹⁹

---

> na pūrvaṃ gamanārambhād gamyamānaṃ na vā gatam |  
> yatrārabhyeta gamanam agate gamanaṃ kutaḥ ||13||

### Translation:

> **[13]** Prior to the beginning of motion,  
> There is neither a "being-traversed" nor a "traversed"  
> Where motion might begin.  
> And in the not-yet-traversed—how could there be motion?²⁰

---

> gataṃ kiṃ gamyamānaṃ kim agataṃ kiṃ vikalpyate |  
> adṛśyamāna ārambhe gamanasyaiva sarvathā ||14||

### Translation:

> **[14]** What "gone-to"? What "being-traversed"? What "not-gone-to"?  
> How can these be conceived  
> When the beginning of motion  
> Is not perceived anywhere at all?²¹

---

## Kārikā 15-17: Standing and Motion

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> gantā na tiṣṭhati tāvad agantā naiva tiṣṭhati |  
> anyo gantur agantruś ca kas tṛtīyo 'tha tiṣṭhati ||15||

### Translation:

> **[15]** The goer does not stand;  
> The non-goer certainly does not stand.  
> What third [entity] other than goer and non-goer  
> Stands?²²

---

> gantā tāvat tiṣṭhatīti katham evopapadyate |  
> gamanena vinā gantā yadā naivopapadyate ||16||

### Translation:

> **[16]** How can "the goer stands" be established  
> When without motion  
> A goer is entirely impossible?²³

---

> na tiṣṭhati gamyamānān na gatān nāgatād api |  
> gamanaṃ saṃpravṛttiś ca nivṛttiś ca gateḥ samā ||17||

### Translation:

> **[17]** He does not come to stand from the being-traversed,  
> Nor from the traversed, nor from the not-traversed.  
> Motion, beginning [of motion], and cessation [of motion]  
> Are [all refuted] the same as motion.²⁴

---

## Kārikā 18-21: Identity and Difference

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> yad eva gamanaṃ gantā sa eveti na yujyate |  
> anya eva punar gantā gater iti na yujyate ||18||

### Translation:

> **[18]** That the goer is identical with the motion  
> Is not tenable.  
> That the goer is different from the motion  
> Is also not tenable.²⁵

---

> yad eva gamanaṃ gantā sa eva hi bhaved yadi |  
> ekībhāvaḥ prasajyeta kartuḥ karmaṇa eva ca ||19||

### Translation:

> **[19]** If the goer were identical with the motion,  
> Identity of agent (*kartṛ*) and action (*karma*)  
> Would follow.²⁶

---

> anya eva punar gantā gater yadi vikalpyate |  
> gamanaṃ syād ṛte gantur gantā syād gamanaṃ ṛte ||20||

### Translation:

> **[20]** If the goer is conceived as different from the motion,  
> There would be motion without a goer,  
> And a goer without motion.²⁷

---

> ekībhāvena vā siddhir nānābhāvena vā yayoḥ |  
> na vidyate tayoḥ siddhiḥ kathaṃ nu khalu vidyate ||21||

### Translation:

> **[21]** When the establishment of these two  
> Is not found through identity or through difference—  
> How indeed could their establishment be found?²⁸

---

## Kārikā 22-24: The Goer and His Going

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> gatyā yayocyate gantā gatiṃ tāṃ sa na gacchati |  
> yasmān na gatipūrvo 'sti kaścit kiṃcid dhi gacchati ||22||

### Translation:

> **[22]** The goer, who is designated by a going,  
> Does not go that going.  
> For prior to going there is no one [already a goer]—  
> [And yet] someone goes somewhere.²⁹

---

> gatyā yayocyate gantā tato 'nyāṃ sa na gacchati |  
> gatī dve nopapadyete yasmād eke pra gacchati ||23||

### Translation:

> **[23]** The goer, who is designated by a going,  
> Does not go a different going.  
> For in one [person], two goings  
> Are not established.³⁰

---

> sadbhūto gamanaṃ gantā triprakāraṃ na gacchati |  
> nāsadbhūto 'pi gamanaṃ triprakāraṃ sa gacchati ||24||  
> gamanaṃ sadasadbhūtaṃ triprakāraṃ ca na gacchati |

### Translation:

> **[24]** An existent goer does not go  
> The three kinds of motion.  
> A non-existent [goer] also does not go  
> The three kinds of motion.  
> [A goer that is] both existent and non-existent  
> Does not go the three kinds of motion.³¹

---

## Kārikā 25: Conclusion

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> tasmād gatiś ca gantā ca gantavyaṃ ca na vidyate ||25||

### Translation:

> **[25]** Therefore, motion, goer, and destination (*gantavya*)  
> Do not exist [with inherent nature].³²

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

Thus, when examined, motion, the goer, and the destination cannot be found with inherent nature. As stated in the *Ākṣayamatinirdeśa-sūtra*:

> *"Non-going is a term of attraction; going is a term of repulsion. Where there is neither attraction nor repulsion—that is the path of the noble ones. By non-entry and non-going is the noble ones' going spoken of."*

And in the *Lalitavistara*:

> *"Just as from the seed there is the sprout, and yet neither is what was the seed identical with the sprout, nor is it entirely other—so is the nature of dharmas: neither annihilated nor eternal."*³³

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Footnotes (1-33)

¹ **[Dialectical]** The threefold division—past, present, future applied to space—structures the entire chapter.

² **[Sanskrit]** *gata* = past passive participle of √gam. Literally "gone-to," "traversed."

³ **[Philosophical]** The *gamyamāna* (being-traversed) is shown to be a mere concept with no reality apart from the other two.

⁴ **[Dialectical]** The opponent is likely a Sarvāstivādin who asserts the real existence of all three times.

⁵ **[Sanskrit]** *ceṣṭā* = activity, movement, exertion. From √ceṣṭ, to move.

⁶ **[Philosophical]** The problem of double action: if "being-traversed" already uses one going, adding "is being traversed" requires a second.

⁷ **[Cross-reference]** This argument structure parallels MMK 1.6-7 (double action in conditions).

⁸ **[Dialectical]** A *prasaṅga*: the opponent's position leads to accepting motion-less "being-traversed."

⁹ **[Sanskrit]** *gamana-dvaya* = double motion. The technical term for this objection.

¹⁰ **[Philosophical]** Agent requires action; double action requires double agent. But there's only one Devadatta.

¹¹ **[Historical]** Candrakīrti explicitly uses "Devadatta" as the standard example of a person.

¹² **[Philosophical]** Mutual dependence (*anyonyāśraya*): neither term can be established first.

¹³ **[Cross-reference]** This structure appears again in Chapter 10 (Fire and Fuel).

¹⁴ **[Dialectical]** Exhaustive trilemma: goer, non-goer, or other—all fail.

¹⁵ **[Modern]** Cf. Wittgenstein's problem of "adding" in rule-following: what does repetition add?

¹⁶ **[Sanskrit]** *gantṛ* = goer, agent of going. From √gam + tṛ (agent suffix).

¹⁷ **[Dialectical]** Reductio: the opponent must accept goer-without-going to make "goer goes" work.

¹⁸ **[Philosophical]** The same double-action argument applied to the goer.

¹⁹ **[Philosophical]** Motion cannot *begin* in any of the three temporal spaces—past, present, or future.

²⁰ **[Cross-reference]** This parallels MMK 7 (Examination of the Conditioned).

²¹ **[Philosophical]** If motion has no beginning, the threefold distinction collapses.

²² **[Dialectical]** The same trilemma now applied to "standing" (*sthiti*).

²³ **[Philosophical]** "Goer stands" is as incoherent as "goer goes."

²⁴ **[Sanskrit]** *saṃpravṛtti* = beginning, initiation. *nivṛtti* = cessation.

²⁵ **[Philosophical]** Identity and difference—the two options exhausted.

²⁶ **[Sanskrit]** *kartṛ-karma ekībhāva* = identity of agent and action. Contradicts ordinary language.

²⁷ **[Dialectical]** Difference implies independence—but goer and going are never found apart.

²⁸ **[Cross-reference]** This verse reappears nearly verbatim in several later chapters.

²⁹ **[Philosophical]** Pre-existing goer problem: you can't be a "goer" before going.

³⁰ **[Sanskrit]** *eke* = in one [person]. There is no second going in a single individual.

³¹ **[Philosophical]** The threefold (existent, non-existent, both) combined with threefold (three kinds of motion) = 9 cases, all refuted.

³² **[Historical]** This is the formal conclusion—all three terms (*gati*, *gantṛ*, *gantavya*) lack svabhāva.

³³ **[Cross-reference]** The *Lalitavistara* verse on seed and sprout directly parallels Chapter 1's argument.

### Key Concepts (Chapter 2)

- **gata** (गत): The "gone-to," past tense of space traversed
- **agata** (अगत): The "not-yet-gone-to," future space
- **gamyamāna** (गम्यमान): The "being-gone-to," present space
- **gantṛ** (गन्तृ): Goer, agent of motion
- **gati/gamana** (गति/गमन): Motion, going
- **gantavya** (गन्तव्य): Destination, that which is to be gone to
- **ceṣṭā** (चेष्टा): Activity, physical exertion

---

### Argument Structure

| Term Examined | Problem Found |
|:--------------|:--------------|
| Gata (gone-to) | Going has ceased—cannot be "being traversed" |
| Agata (not-gone-to) | Going hasn't begun—cannot be "being traversed" |
| Gamyamāna (being-traversed) | Requires double motion, therefore double goer |
| Gantṛ (goer) | Defined by going, yet "goer goes" needs second going |
| Gati (motion) | Cannot begin in any of the three spaces |
| Gantavya (destination) | Falls with goer and motion |

### Soul Check Hints for Bluesman

**Blues Translation Guidance:**

1. **Verse 1**: "Where you been ain't being walked. Where you going ain't being walked. And that space you're standing in? When you look for the walking, it ain't there neither."

2. **Verse 8**: "The walker don't walk—'cause if he's already walking, what's 'he walks' adding? The non-walker don't walk—that's just words. And there ain't nobody else."

3. **Verse 12-14**: "You can't start walking in where you already been. You can't start walking in where you haven't got to yet. And you can't start walking in where you're at—'cause there ain't no 'where you're at' apart from been and going."

4. **Verse 25**: "So the walking, the walker, and where he's going—all three come up empty when you really look."

5. **Core insight**: Motion is the most obvious thing in the world. If it turns out to be empty of inherent nature, everything is.

# Chapter 3: Cakṣurādīndriya-parīkṣā (चक्षुरादीन्द्रियपरीक्षा)
# Examination of the Senses

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

---

## Introduction

The opponent argues: Even though motion has been refuted, the senses (seeing, hearing, etc.) are established on the authority of scripture. As stated in the Abhidharma:

> *"Seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and mind—  
> These are the six sense-faculties;  
> The visible and so forth are their domains."*

Therefore, the senses exist by their own nature. Nāgārjuna responds: They do not exist [with inherent nature].

---

## Kārikā 1: The Six Senses and Their Objects

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> darśanaṃ śravaṇaṃ ghrāṇaṃ rasanaṃ sparśanaṃ manaḥ |  
> indriyāṇi ṣaḍ eteṣāṃ draṣṭavyādīni gocaraḥ ||1||

### Translation:

> **[1]** Seeing, hearing, smelling,  
> Tasting, touching, and mind—  
> These are the six sense-faculties.  
> The visible and so forth are their domains.¹

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

The eye is called "seeing" (*darśana*) because it sees. Form (*rūpa*) is taught as its object. But this designation is problematic, as will be shown.²

---

## Kārikā 2: Seeing Does Not See Itself

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> svam ātmānaṃ darśanaṃ hi tat tad eva na paśyati |  
> na paśyati yad ātmānaṃ kathaṃ drakṣyati tat parān ||2||

### Translation:

> **[2]** That very seeing does not see itself—  
> Its own self it does not see.  
> What does not see itself—  
> How will it see others?³

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

Seeing does not see its own self due to the contradiction of action upon itself (*svātmani kriyā-virodha*). Just as a sword cannot cut itself, just as a fingertip cannot touch itself, seeing cannot see seeing.

If it cannot see itself, then—like a pillar or a wall—it cannot see others either. For if it were capable of seeing, it would be able to see itself as well as others. Since it cannot see itself, it is not a seer, and therefore cannot see anything.⁴

---

## Kārikā 3: The Fire Analogy Fails

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> na paryāpto 'gnidṛṣṭānto darśanasya prasiddhaye |  
> sa darśanena saḥ proktaḥ gamyamānagātāgataih ||3||

### Translation:

> **[3]** The fire analogy is not adequate  
> To establish seeing.  
> That [fire], together with seeing,  
> Is refuted by [the analysis of] the being-traversed, traversed, and not-yet-traversed.⁵

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

Objection: "Although seeing does not see itself, it sees others—like fire, which burns others but not itself."

Response: This analogy fails. The same arguments from Chapter 2 apply: Just as "the gone-to is not being traversed, the not-gone-to is not being traversed, and the being-traversed is not being traversed," so too "the burned is not being burned, the not-burned is not being burned, and the being-burned is not being burned."

Therefore, just as we said of the goer, so we say:

> *"The burned is not being burned;  
> The not-burned is not being burned;  
> Apart from burned and not-burned,  
> The being-burned is not being burned."*

And:

> *"The burner does not burn;  
> The non-burner does not burn."*

Similarly for seeing:

> *"The seen is not being seen;  
> The not-seen is not being seen."*

And: *"The seer does not see."*⁶

---

## Kārikā 4: If Seeing Sees Nothing

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> nāpaśyamānaṃ bhavati yadā kiṃcana darśanam |  
> darśanaṃ paśyatīty evaṃ katham etat tu yujyate ||4||

### Translation:

> **[4]** When seeing is not seeing anything,  
> [It is said] "seeing sees"—  
> How is this appropriate?⁷

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

When seeing sees nothing, like a pillar or a wall, calling it "seeing sees" is incoherent. The designation "seeing" (*darśana*) implies the activity of seeing (*paśyati*). But if there is no seeing happening, there is no seer.⁸

---

## Kārikā 5: The Seer is Also Refuted

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> vyākhyāto darśaneneva draṣṭā cāpy upagamyatām ||5||

### Translation:

> **[5]** Just as seeing has been explained,  
> So too the seer should be understood [as refuted].⁹

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

The same refutation applies to the seer (*draṣṭṛ*):

> *"The seer does not see itself with seeing.  
> What does not see itself—  
> How will it see others?"*

Therefore, like seeing, the seer also does not exist [with inherent nature].¹⁰

---

## Kārikā 6: Without Seer, No Seen or Seeing

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> tiraskṛtya draṣṭā nāsty atiraskṛtya ca darśanam |  
> draṣṭavyaṃ darśanaṃ caiva draṣṭary asati te kutaḥ ||6||

### Translation:

> **[6]** Without [seeing] the seer does not exist,  
> And with [seeing excluded] also not.  
> The seen and seeing—  
> In the absence of the seer, from where [would they come]?¹¹

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

If the seer is examined, it is either dependent on seeing or independent of it:
- If dependent on seeing: an already-established seer needs no further seeing; an un-established seer, like the son of a barren woman, cannot depend on anything.
- If independent of seeing: there is no seer without seeing.

When the seer does not exist, the seen (*draṣṭavya*) and seeing (*darśana*) also cannot arise, for they are mutually dependent.¹²

---

## Kārikā 7: Dependent Origination of Consciousness

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> pratītya mātāpitarau yathoktaḥ putrasaṃbhavaḥ |  
> cakṣū rūpe pratītyaivaṃ uktā vijñānasaṃbhavaḥ ||7||

### Translation:

> **[7]** Just as the arising of a son is spoken of  
> Depending on mother and father,  
> So the arising of consciousness  
> Is spoken of depending on eye and form.¹³

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

Objection: The seen and seeing exist because their effect—consciousness—exists. As taught: "Depending on eye and form, visual consciousness arises. From the conjunction of the three is contact; together with contact is feeling; conditioned by that is craving." Thus the twelve links of dependent origination prove the existence of the seen and seeing.

Response: They would exist if consciousness existed. But:¹⁴

---

## Kārikā 8: Without Seen and Seeing, No Consciousness

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> draṣṭavyadarśanābhāvād vijñānādicatuṣṭayam |  
> nāstīti |  
> upādānādīni bhaviṣyanti punaḥ katham ||8||

### Translation:

> **[8]** In the absence of the seen and seeing,  
> The fourfold [set of] consciousness and so forth  
> Does not exist.  
> So how will grasping and the rest come to be?¹⁵

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

Without seer, the seen and seeing do not exist. Without those, consciousness does not arise. Without consciousness, neither contact (*sparśa*), feeling (*vedanā*), craving (*tṛṣṇā*), nor grasping (*upādāna*) can arise. The twelve links collapse.¹⁶

---

## Kārikā 9: Extension to All Senses

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> vyākhyātaṃ śravaṇaṃ ghrāṇaṃ rasanaṃ sparśanaṃ manaḥ |  
> darśaneneva jānīyac chrotṛ śrotavyakādi ca ||9||

### Translation:

> **[9]** Hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and mind  
> Are explained [the same way].  
> Just as with seeing, so should one understand  
> The hearer, the heard, and so forth.¹⁷

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

The same analysis applies to all six senses:
- The hearer does not hear itself; hence cannot hear others
- The smeller, taster, toucher, and thinker are similarly refuted
- Their objects and activities are equally without inherent nature

As the Buddha said:

> *"The eye does not see forms;  
> The mind does not know dharmas.  
> This is the supreme truth  
> Into which the world does not enter."*¹⁸

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Footnotes (1-18)

¹ **[Sanskrit]** *indriya* = sense-faculty, from √ind (to rule). The senses are "rulers" of their domains.

² **[Historical]** This verse summarizes the Abhidharma classification of six sense-bases (*āyatana*).

³ **[Philosophical]** The self-reflexivity problem: if seeing requires a seer, and seeing is the seer's activity, the seer would need to see its own seeing—which is impossible.

⁴ **[Modern]** Cf. the problem of self-knowledge in phenomenology: can consciousness be conscious of itself in the same act?

⁵ **[Cross-reference]** The "fire analogy" (*agni-dṛṣṭānta*) is refuted by applying Chapter 2's trilemma.

⁶ **[Dialectical]** This shows that all Chapter 2 arguments about motion apply equally to burning, seeing, hearing, etc.

⁷ **[Sanskrit]** *apaśyamāna* = not seeing. The present passive participle indicates the absence of the activity.

⁸ **[Philosophical]** Designations require activities; without the activity, the designation is empty.

⁹ **[Cross-reference]** *Vyākhyāta* = "explained" — pointing back to the seeing analysis.

¹⁰ **[Dialectical]** The seer (*draṣṭṛ*) and seeing (*darśana*) are mutually dependent and mutually undermine each other.

¹¹ **[Sanskrit]** *tiraskṛtya* = "having excluded, put aside."

¹² **[Philosophical]** Mutual dependence (*anyonyāśraya*): the triad of seer-seen-seeing cannot be established independently.

¹³ **[Historical]** The "son from mother and father" is a standard example of dependent origination in Buddhist texts.

¹⁴ **[Cross-reference]** The twelve links (*dvādaśāṅga*) of dependent origination are examined in Chapter 26.

¹⁵ **[Sanskrit]** *catuṣṭaya* = fourfold: consciousness, contact, feeling, craving.

¹⁶ **[Philosophical]** If the base (seer/seen/seeing) is unfounded, all that depends on it collapses.

¹⁷ **[Dialectical]** Formal extension: what applies to one sense applies to all six.

¹⁸ **[Historical]** The final quotation emphasizes that "supreme truth" (*paramārtha*) is beyond sensory cognition.

### Key Concepts (Chapter 3)

- **darśana** (दर्शन): Seeing, vision, the eye-faculty
- **draṣṭṛ** (द्रष्टृ): Seer, the one who sees
- **draṣṭavya** (द्रष्टव्य): The seen, that which is to be seen
- **indriya** (इन्द्रिय): Sense-faculty
- **vijñāna** (विज्ञान): Consciousness, specifically sense-consciousness
- **sparśa** (स्पर्श): Contact (the conjunction of faculty, object, and consciousness)

### Argument Structure

| Term Examined | Problem Found |
|:--------------|:--------------|
| Seeing (*darśana*) | Cannot see itself; hence cannot see others |
| Fire analogy | Subject to same refutation as motion |
| Seer (*draṣṭṛ*) | Dependent on seeing, which is unfounded |
| Seen (*draṣṭavya*) | Dependent on seer, who is unfounded |
| Consciousness (*vijñāna*) | Without seer/seen, no consciousness |
| All senses | Same analysis applies |

*End of Chapter 3 scholarly translation. Ready for Bluesman review.*
# Chapter 4: Skandha-parīkṣā (स्कन्धपरीक्षा)
# Examination of the Aggregates

## Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

---

## Introduction

The opponent argues: Even if the sense-faculties (*indriya*) do not exist [with inherent nature], the five aggregates (*skandha*) exist, since they have not been refuted. The sense-faculties are included within the aggregates. Therefore, they too must exist.

Nāgārjuna responds: The aggregates would exist if they could be established. Let us examine the aggregate of form (*rūpa*).

---

## Kārikā 1: Form and Its Cause

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> rūpakāraṇanirmuktaṃ na rūpam upalabhyate |  
> rūpeṇāpi na nirmuktam iṣyate rūpakāraṇam ||1||

### Translation:

> **[1]** Form is not found  
> Apart from the cause of form.  
> Nor is the cause of form  
> Found apart from form.¹

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

"Form" (*rūpa*) refers to derived material form (*bhautika*)—the objects of the five senses. Its cause is the four great elements (*mahābhūta*): earth, water, fire, and wind.

If form were separate from its cause (like a pot separate from cloth), it could be found independently. But form is not found apart from the elements. Nor are the elements found apart from form—they are not perceived separately, like pot and cloth. This is mutual dependence.²

---

## Kārikā 2: Form Without Cause is Causeless

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> rūpakāraṇanirmukṭe rūpe rūpaṃ prasajyate |  
> āhetukamam ataś caiva na cāsty arthaḥ kaścid āhetukaḥ kacit ||2||

### Translation:

> **[2]** If form [existed] apart from the cause of form,  
> Form would be without cause.  
> But there is no entity anywhere  
> That is without cause.³

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

If form existed independently of its cause (the four elements), it would be *āhetuka*—causeless. But nothing exists without cause. Even a mirage has conditions. Therefore, form apart from its cause cannot be accepted.⁴

---

## Kārikā 3: Cause Without Effect is Effectless

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> rūpeṇa tu vinirmuktaṃ yadi syād rūpakāraṇam |  
> akāryakaṃ kāraṇaṃ syān nāsty akāryaṃ ca kāraṇam ||3||

### Translation:

> **[3]** If the cause of form  
> Were separate from form,  
> It would be a cause without an effect.  
> But there is no cause without an effect.⁵

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

Conversely: if the elements existed separately from form, they would be a "cause" of nothing—an *akāryaka-kāraṇa*. But causality requires an effect. Without the effect, there is no cause. The designation "cause" (*kāraṇa*) is relational—it depends on having an effect (*kārya*).⁶

---

## Kārikā 4: Neither Existent Nor Non-Existent Form Has a Cause

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> rūpe satyeva rūpasya kāraṇaṃ nopapadyate |  
> rūpe 'satyeva rūpasya kāraṇaṃ nopapadyate ||4||

### Translation:

> **[4]** When form exists,  
> A cause of form is not established.  
> When form does not exist,  
> A cause of form is not established.⁷

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

The familiar dilemma from Chapter 1:
- If form already exists, what need is there of a cause? The work is done.
- If form does not exist, what would the cause be a cause *of*? You cannot cause the non-existent.

Neither horn allows the establishment of causation with inherent nature.⁸

---

## Kārikā 5: Form Without Cause is Impossible

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> niṣkāraṇaṃ punar rūpaṃ naiva naivopapadyate |  
> tasmād rūpagatān kaṃścin na vikalpān vikalpayed ||5||

### Translation:

> **[5]** Form without cause  
> Is entirely impossible.  
> Therefore, regarding form,  
> One should not fabricate any concepts.⁹

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

The emphatic double negative (*naiva naiva*) stresses that causeless form is absolutely impossible. The conclusion: a wise practitioner should not conceptually proliferate about form—not distinguishing it as "tangible/intangible," "visible/invisible," "past/future," "blue/yellow," and so forth.¹⁰

---

## Kārikā 6: Cause and Effect—Similar or Dissimilar?

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> na kāraṇasya sadṛśaṃ kāryam ity upapadyate |  
> na kāraṇasyāsadṛśaṃ kāryam ity upapadyate ||6||

### Translation:

> **[6]** That the effect is similar to the cause  
> Is not tenable.  
> That the effect is dissimilar to the cause  
> Is also not tenable.¹¹

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

Examining the cause-effect relationship:
- **Similar**: The four elements are hard, fluid, hot, and mobile. Derived form (the sense-objects) has different characteristics—color, sound, smell, taste, texture. They are *not* similar, like a loom and its product.
- **Dissimilar**: But if cause and effect were entirely different, any cause could produce any effect—fire could produce water. We don't observe this.

Neither option establishes an inherent cause-effect link.¹²

---

## Kārikā 7: Extension to All Aggregates

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> vedanā cittasaṃjñānāṃ saṃskārāṇāṃ ca sarvaśaḥ |  
> sarveṣām eva bhāvānāṃ rūpeṇaiva samaḥ kramaḥ ||7||

### Translation:

> **[7]** For feeling, mind, perception,  
> And formations—for all of them,  
> And for all entities whatsoever,  
> The procedure is the same as for form.¹³

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

What applies to form applies to the other four aggregates:
- **Vedanā** (feeling) arises from contact—but contact has no inherent nature
- **Saṃjñā** (perception) is concomitant with consciousness—but consciousness is empty
- **Saṃskārā** (formations) are conditioned by ignorance—but ignorance is also empty
- **Vijñāna** (consciousness) depends on formations—but formations are empty

The entire chain of dependent origination, when analyzed, reveals no inherent nature.¹⁴

## Kārikā 8: Refutation of Objections via Emptiness

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> vigrahe yaḥ parīhāraṃ kṛte śūnyatayā vadet |  
> sarve tasyāparihṛtaṃ samaṃ sādhyena jāyate ||8||

### Translation:

> **[8]** In a dispute, if [the opponent] makes an objection  
> Against [the demonstration] made through emptiness,  
> All of that is un-refuted—  
> It is equal to what is being proved.¹⁵

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

When the Mādhyamika refutes form's inherent nature using emptiness, if the opponent objects: "But feeling exists, so form must exist too"—this objection doesn't work. The argument for emptiness applies equally to feeling and all other phenomena. The objection is *sādhya-sama*—"equal to the thesis to be proved."

In other words: you can't refute one emptiness by appealing to another entity that is equally empty.¹⁶

## Kārikā 9: Objections in Explanation Are Also Equal to the Thesis

### Sanskrit (IAST):

> vyākhyāne ya upālambhaṃ kṛte śūnyatayā vadet |  
> tasyānupālambhaṃ samaṃ sādhyena jāyate ||9||

### Translation:

> **[9]** In [our] explanation, if [someone] makes a criticism  
> Against [the demonstration] made through emptiness,  
> That [criticism] is un-criticized—  
> It is equal to what is being proved.¹⁷

### Commentary (Prasannapadā):

Similarly, during the commentarial explanation (*vyākhyāna*), any criticism of the emptiness teaching falls to the same objection: the critic's counter-example is also empty.

As stated:
> *"The emptiness of one dharma is declared to be the emptiness of all.  
> The emptiness of one is indeed the emptiness of everything."*

The Mādhyamika teaching is thus defended by the universality of emptiness itself.¹⁸

¹ **[Sanskrit]** *rūpakāraṇa* = cause of form. The four *mahābhūta* (great elements): earth, water, fire, wind.

² **[Philosophical]** Mutual dependence (*anyonyāśraya*) again: cause depends on effect, effect depends on cause.

³ **[Sanskrit]** *āhetuka* = without cause. This is the fourth option in the *catuṣkoṭi*, here rejected.

⁴ **[Cross-reference]** Cf. MMK 1.3: neither from self, other, both, nor without cause.

⁵ **[Philosophical]** A cause without an effect is a contradiction in terms. Causality is relational.

⁶ **[Modern]** Cf. Hume's problem of causation: we never observe "causation" itself, only regularities.

⁷ **[Cross-reference]** This restates MMK 1.8 in the context of form.

⁸ **[Dialectical]** The satkarya-asatkarya dilemma: existent effects can't be caused (redundancy), non-existent effects can't be caused (impossibility).

⁹ **[Sanskrit]** *vikalpān na vikalpayed* = "should not fabricate concepts." This is the practical conclusion.

¹⁰ **[Cross-reference]** Links to MMK 18's analysis of conceptual proliferation (*prapañca*).

¹¹ **[Philosophical]** The similar-dissimilar dilemma refutes both *satkārya-vāda* (effect pre-exists in cause) and extreme difference.

¹² **[Historical]** The "loom and product" example is Candrakīrti's—the elements and form have different characteristics.

¹³ **[Sanskrit]** *samaḥ kramaḥ* = "the same procedure." Formal extension to all aggregates.

¹⁴ **[Cross-reference]** The five *skandhas* are examined implicitly here; each is dependent and therefore empty.

¹⁵ **[Dialectical]** *sādhya-sama* = "equal to the thesis." A logical fallacy where the counter-example needs the same proof.

¹⁶ **[Philosophical]** The universality of emptiness defends itself: any objection is subject to the same analysis.

¹⁷ **[Historical]** This verse anticipates objections to Candrakīrti's own commentary.

¹⁸ **[Cross-reference]** The quoted verse is from *Śūnyatāsaptati* (Seventy Stanzas on Emptiness).

**nākāśaṃ vidyate kiṃcit pūrvam ākāśalakṣaṇāt |**
**alakṣaṇaṃ prasajyeta syāt pūrvam yadi lakṣaṇāt ||**

**Translation**:
"Space (*ākāśa*) does not exist at all prior to the characteristic of space.
If it existed prior to the characteristic, it would follow that it is without characteristic."

**Commentary**:
*   **Prasannapadā**: The opponent argues that the six elements (Earth, Water, Fire, Wind, Space, Consciousness) are the fundamental building blocks of reality. Nāgārjuna chooses Space (*ākāśa*) because it is often considered unconditioned (*asaṃskṛta*) or eternal.
*   **The Dilemma**: A substance cannot exist without its defining attribute. Fire is not Fire without Heat. Space is not Space without "non-obstruction" (*anāvaraṇa*).

## Verse 5.2
**alakṣaṇo na kaścic ca bhāvaḥ saṃvidyate kva cit |**
**asaty alakṣaṇe bhāve kramatā kuṭa lakṣaṇam ||**

**Translation**:
"An entity without characteristic is not found anywhere.
When an entity without characteristic does not exist, where does the characteristic apply?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Lakṣaṇa-Lakṣya** ("Characteristic/Characterized"): This is the central ontological problem.
    *   Does the Characteristic (Heat) come to a Characterized (Fire)?
    *   If Fire is already there, it doesn't need Heat.
    *   If Fire isn't there, Heat has nowhere to land.

**Translation**:
"The function of the characteristic does not occur in the uncharacterized, nor in the characterized.
Nor does it occur elsewhere than the characterized and uncharacterized."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Impossible Landing**:
    *   *Alakṣaṇa* (Uncharacterized): A "Something" with no qualities is a logical fiction.
    *   *Salakṣaṇa* (Characterized): If it already has the quality, adding it again is redundant (*vaiyarthya*).

## Verse 5.4
**lakṣaṇāsaṃpravṛttau ca na lakṣyam upapadyate |**
**lakṣyasyānupapattau ca lakṣaṇasyāpy asaṃbhavaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"And when the function of the characteristic does not occur, the characterized is not established.
And when the characterized is not established, the arising of the characteristic is also impossible."

**Commentary**:
*   **Mutual Dependence**: They are not two things; they are one conceptual package. You can't peal the "Heat" off the "Fire" to see what's underneath.
*   **Cross-Reference**: See **Chapter 15 (*Svabhāva-parīkṣā*)**, where intrinsic nature is defined as independent. Here, the elements are shown to be dependent, thus empty of *svabhāva*.

## Verse 5.5
**tasmān na vidyate lakṣyaṃ na lakṣaṇam eva ca |**
**lakṣyalakṣaṇanirmukto naiva bhāvo 'pi vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Therefore, the characterized is not found, nor is the characteristic found.
And an entity liberated from characteristic and characterized is not found either."

**Commentary**:
*   **Ontological Collapse**: If the basic elements of the universe (Earth, Water, etc.) cannot be established as substantial entities, then the "World" built from them is like a dream.

## Verse 5.7
**ākāśaṃ labhyate naivaṃ sad asan na ca gamyate |**

**Translation**:
"Thus, space is not obtained; it is not understood as existent or non-existent.
This very same analysis applies to the [other] five elements."

**Commentary**:
*   **Atideśa** ("Extension"): The logic applied to Space applies to Earth (Solidity), Water (Fluidity), Fire (Heat), Wind (Motility), and Consciousness (Cognition). None have independent existence.

---

## Verse 5.8
**parīkṣīṇā hi ye dṛṣṭāḥ pañcadhā bhāvābhāvayoḥ |**
**ye paśyanti na paśyanti te tattvaṃ buddhaśāsane ||**

**Translation**:
"Those who see existence and non-existence in the five ways regarding those examined—
They do not see the truth in the Teaching of the Buddha."

**Commentary**:
*   **Pañcadhā** ("Five ways"): Probably refers to the five elements or the fivefold search (*pañcadhā mṛgya*).
*   **The Warning**: Reification of the elements is the root of the "Self" view. If you think the "bricks" are real, you will think the "house" (Self) is real.# Chapter 6: Examination of Desire and the Desirous (Rāgarakta-parīkṣā)

## Introduction

This chapter applies the rigorous dialectic established in the examination of the elements (*dhātu-parīkṣā*, Chapter 5) to the psychological realm. Here, Nāgārjuna investigates the relationship between a defining mental affliction—desire or passion (*rāga*)—and the subject who is characterized by it, the desirous one (*rakta*).

The opponent likely represents an **Abhidharma** perspective, which analyzes the person into discrete, substantially real *dharmas* (mental factors and consciousness). From this view, *rāga* is a distinct, existent mental state (*caitasika*) that arises in relation to a foundation—the person or mind-stream. The **Sāṃkhya** view of a permanent *puruṣa* (self) who "has" mental states is also implicitly targeted.

Nāgārjuna demonstrates that neither the emotion nor the one who has it can be established with intrinsic nature (*svabhāva*). The method parallels Chapter 5: if the desirous one and desire were intrinsically real, they would have to be either identical or different—both options lead to absurdity.

## Kārikā 6.1

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*rāgād yadi bhaved pūrvaṃ rakto rāgam apekṣya tam |*
*rāgaḥ syāt pratibaddhaḥ san rakto hi sati rāgiṇi ||*

**Translation**:
If the desirous one¹ existed prior to desire,² then desire, depending on him, would exist [only] when bound [to him]. For the desirous one exists when there is desire.³

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
Candrakīrti frames the problem: the opponent might claim that a person exists first, and then desire arises in relation to that person. But this creates a paradox—if the "desirous one" (*rakta*) existed before desire, in what sense would he be "desirous"? The very designation depends on the presence of desire. A "desirous one without desire" is a contradiction in terms.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Sanskrit] *rakta* (रक्त): Lit. "stained" or "colored"; the one characterized by passion/desire.
² [Sanskrit] *rāga* (राग): Passion, desire, attachment; one of the three root afflictions (*kleśa*).
³ [Dialectical] This is the first horn of the dilemma: temporal priority of the substrate over the quality.

---

## Kārikā 6.2

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*raktena hi sahaiva rāgas tad abhinnatvāt tad apekṣaṇāt |*
*rāgo 'py anā śritaḥ kasmād bhaved rāgī ca ko bhavet ||*

**Translation**:
Desire exists only together with the desirous one, for it depends on him and is non-different from him.¹ But if desire has no [independent] basis, how could there be a desirous one?²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
This verse explores the reverse: if desire cannot exist independently of a desirous person, then desire lacks autonomous existence. But if desire itself is not established, how can there be someone defined by having it? The mutual dependence is exposed.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Philosophical] "Non-different" (*abhinna*) here means functionally inseparable, not metaphysically identical.
² [Dialectical] The second horn: if desire depends on *rakta*, but *rakta* depends on *rāga*, we have circular dependency (*anyonyāśraya*).

---

## Kārikā 6.3

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*sahabhāvo na caitasya yukto rāgasya rāgiṇaḥ |*
*bhaveyātām hy anyataś cātma tatra sahabhāvatā ||*

**Translation**:
Simultaneous arising¹ of desire and the desirous one is also not tenable. For [if they arose together], they would be mutually other,² [and then] how could there be [genuine] co-arising?

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
Candrakīrti considers simultaneous origination. If *rāga* and *rakta* arose at the exact same moment, neither could be the cause or ground of the other. They would be utterly distinct (*anya*), and their connection would be arbitrary—like two unrelated events happening to occur together.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Sanskrit] *sahabhāva* (सहभाव): "Co-existence," "simultaneous being."
² [Philosophical] If simultaneous yet distinct, no explanatory relation holds between them.

---

## Kārikā 6.4

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*ekatvena sa eva syād yadi rāgo' tha rāgiṇaḥ |*
*bhinatā syād asaṃsparśaḥ kā syād tatra sahāstitā ||*

**Translation**:
If desire and the desirous one were identical,¹ [the desirous one] would be that very [desire]. If they were different, there would be no contact [between them]²—how could there be co-existence?

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
The classic Mādhyamaka dilemma: identity or difference. If identical, the distinction between the emotion and the person collapses—there is no "one who desires," just desire. If utterly different, they would be like unrelated objects with no necessary connection.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Sanskrit] *ekatva* (एकत्व): "Oneness," identity.
² [Sanskrit] *asaṃsparśa* (असंस्पर्श): "Non-contact," lack of relation or connection.

---

## Kārikā 6.5

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*ekatvena hi rāgasya siddher na syāt sa rāgiṇā |*
*rāgo 'pi na bhavet tasmād rāgiṇā saha vastutaḥ ||*

**Translation**:
If desire were established through identity [with the desirous one], there would be no [distinct] desirous one.¹ Therefore, desire also would not exist together with a desirous one in reality.²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
Candrakīrti draws the consequence: if we collapse the distinction (identity), we lose the very relational structure that gives meaning to "desire" and "desirous one." Without a desirous person distinct from desire, there is no substrate for desire. Without desire, there is no basis for calling someone desirous.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Dialectical] Identity eliminates the relatum—if A = B, then "A and B" loses meaning.
² [Sanskrit] *vastutaḥ* (वस्तुतः): "In reality," "in truth," as opposed to mere convention.

---

## Kārikā 6.6

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*nānātve sati rāgo'sya na dṛṣṭaś cet kathaṃ bhavet |*
*sahāstitā'sya rāgasya rakto rāgeṇa yad vinā ||*

**Translation**:
If [they were] different, desire is not seen [to exist independently].¹ How could there be co-existence of desire and the desirous one, [when the desirous one would exist] without desire?²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
Candrakīrti applies empirical observation: we never observe desire floating free of any person, nor a "desirous one" utterly devoid of desire. Their apparent separateness is not confirmed by experience.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Philosophical] Difference (*nānātvā*) would require independent observability of each term.
² [Cross-reference] This parallels MMK 10's fire/fuel analysis—fire is not seen apart from fuel.

---

## Kārikā 6.7

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*nānātvaṃ yadi siddhyeta rakto rāgeṇa te vinā |*
*nānātve sati sambandhaḥ rāgaraktayor bhavet ||*

**Translation**:
If difference were established, the desirous one would be without desire.¹ And if there were difference, there could be a relation between desire and the desirous one.²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
This verse explores the opponent's escape: "Difference allows for relation!" But Nāgārjuna shows this fails—if truly different, the "desirous one" would be definable without reference to desire, which contradicts his very definition.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Dialectical] A "desirous one without desire" is an oxymoron.
² [Philosophical] The opponent might claim difference grounds relation, but this is explored and rejected.

---

## Kārikā 6.8

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*nānātve sati siddhyāṃ vā kiṃ nānātvaṃ hi kalpyate |*
*ekatvasiddhyartham vā kiṃ naiva ekatvam iṣyate ||*

**Translation**:
If difference were established, why would difference be postulated?¹ Or if identity were to be established, why would identity not be accepted?²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
Candrakīrti points to the logical circularity: the opponent's positions (identity or difference) are adopted to explain the relation, but neither can be independently established. The postulation is arbitrary.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Dialectical] Difference cannot be demonstrated without first establishing the relata—but establishing the relata requires explaining their relation.
² [Philosophical] Both identity and difference are conceptual imputations (*kalpanā*), not intrinsic facts.

---

## Kārikā 6.9

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*nānātvaṃ na hi sidhyeta yathāsty anupapannatā |*
*tasmād rāgī ca rāgaś ca grāhyagrāhakayor iva ||*

**Translation**:
Difference is indeed not established, as [their separate] existence is untenable.¹ Therefore, the desirous one and desire are like the apprehended and the apprehender.²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
Candrakīrti introduces an analogy: the "grasped" (*grāhya*—the object of cognition) and the "grasper" (*grāhaka*—the cognizing subject) are similarly mutually dependent. Neither can be found independently. This anticipates cognitive analyses in later chapters.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Philosophical] *anupapannatā*: "Untenability," logical failure.
² [Cross-reference] *grāhya-grāhaka* analysis is central to Yogācāra and is critiqued in MMK 18.

---

## Kārikā 6.10

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*rāgaraktaparīkṣeyaṃ sarvakleśeṣu yujyate |*
*sarvāyataneṣu caiva sarvakleśopaśāntiṣu ||*

**Translation**:
This examination of desire and the desirous one applies to all afflictions,¹ to all sense-bases,² and to the cessation of all afflictions.³

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
The chapter concludes with explicit universalization. The analysis is not limited to *rāga*—it applies equally to *dveṣa* (hatred) and the hater, *moha* (delusion) and the deluded, and so forth. It extends to all *āyatanas* (sense-bases) and even to the purification process itself.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Sanskrit] *kleśa* (क्लेश): Afflictions—*rāga*, *dveṣa*, *moha*, etc.
² [Sanskrit] *āyatana* (आयतन): Sense-bases—the six sense organs and their objects.
³ [Soteriological] Even liberation cannot be reified—the "one who is liberated" and "liberation" are also empty.

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Key Concepts

| Term | Sanskrit | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| **rāga** | राग | Desire, passion, attachment; one of the three poisons |
| **rakta** | रक्त | The desirous one; lit. "stained" or "colored" by passion |
| **kleśa** | क्लेश | Affliction; mental state that causes suffering |
| **dveṣa** | द्वेष | Hatred, aversion; second of the three poisons |
| **moha** | मोह | Delusion, ignorance; third of the three poisons |
| **grāhya** | ग्राह्य | The apprehended; object of cognition |
| **grāhaka** | ग्राहक | The apprehender; cognizing subject |
| **anyonyāśraya** | अन्योन्याश्रय | Mutual dependence; circular support |
| **sahabhāva** | सहभाव | Simultaneous existence; co-arising |

### Argument Structure

**Pūrvapakṣa (Opponent's Position)**:
The Abhidharma/Sarvāstivāda holds that mental afflictions (*kleśa*) like desire are real, distinct *dharmas* that arise in a mind-stream. The "desirous one" is the conventional designation for the aggregate of such states. Both exist substantially (as distinct *dharmas* in relation).

**Mādhyamaka Response (Prasaṅga)**:
1. **Establish Mutual Dependency** (6.2-3): Neither *rāga* nor *rakta* can be identified without the other
2. **Refute Identity** (6.4-5): Leads to confusion of action and agent
3. **Refute Difference** (6.5-7): Leads to an independent *rakta* devoid of *rāga*, which is absurd
4. **Apply Perception Analogy** (6.6): Neither identity nor difference is empirically verifiable
5. **Conclusion via Tetralemma** (6.8): Both identity and difference are untenable
6. **Analogical Clarification** (6.9): Their existence is relational, like grasper/grasped
7. **Universalization** (6.10): Emptiness of one implies emptiness of all afflictions

## Verse 7.1
**yady utpādo bhaved utpāda utpādaḥ kathaṃ bhavet |**
**atha utpādyamānasya kiṃ utpatti bhaved iti ||**

**Translation**:
"If arising itself were arisen, then arising would have another arising.
Or if [arising] is of the already-arisen, what arising could there be?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Prasannapadā**: Candrakīrti identifies the opponent as the **Sarvāstivādin**, who posits that *Utpāda* (Arising) is a real dharma that functions to make other dharmas arise.
*   **The Dilemma**: If *Utpāda* is a conditioned dharma (*saṃskṛta*), it must have the three marks (arising, abiding, ceasing). Thus, *Utpāda* must have its own *Utpāda*. This leads to **Infinite Regress** (*anavasthā*). If it *doesn't* have its own arising, it is unconditioned (*asaṃskṛta*) and cannot interact with the conditioned world.

---

## Verse 7.2
**utpādaḥ syād anutpanna utpannaś ca kathaṃ bhavet |**
**tadutpāda utpādyeta kiṃ tad utpādayed iti ||**

**Translation**:
"If arising were unarisen, how could it be arising?
If it were arisen, by what would it be arisen?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Anutpanna** ("Unarisen"): If arising is unarisen, it is eternal/unconditioned (like Space or Nirvana). An eternal thing cannot be a cause of a temporal event.
*   **Utpanna** ("Arisen"): If it is arisen, it requires a second Arising (*Utpāda-utpāda*). Does that second arising require a third?

---

## Verse 7.3
**utpādamāno hi bhavet sa na utpādaḥ kathaṃcana |**
**utpādayaty aniṣpanno yadi utpādaḥ kathaṃ bhavet ||**

**Translation**:
"If arising were [in the process of] arising, it would not be arising at all.
If an unaccomplished [arising] produces, how can it be arising?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Prasannapadā**: The opponent tries to use the present participle "arising" (*utpādamāna*) to avoid the static dilemma. Nāgārjuna replies: "A process that hasn't finished happening cannot make something else happen." You can't cook rice with a fire that is "in the process of being lit" but not yet lit.

---

## Verse 7.4
**utpattau triprakārāyāṃ niruddhe cāpy eṣa vidyate |**
**saṃskṛtasya ca yat spaṣṭaṃ siddhaṃ tat kiṃ na vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"The same [analysis] applies to the threefold arising, and to cessation as well.
What is clearly established for the conditioned—why is it not found?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Cross-Reference**: This anticipates **Chapter 21 (*Saṃbhava-vibhava-parīkṣā*)**, where the simultaneous presence of Arising and Cessation is refuted.
*   **Triprakārāyām** ("Threefold"): Arising from Self, Other, or Both (See **Chapter 1**).

---

## Verse 7.5
**sthitau yadi sthitir bhaved sthiteḥ sthitir bhavet punaḥ |**
**sā ca sthitir na sidhyeta tathā sthiteḥ sthitiḥ kathaṃ ||**

**Translation**:
"If duration had duration, there would again be duration of duration.
But that duration is not established—so how [could there be] duration of duration?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Sthiti** ("Duration/Abiding"): The Sarvāstivādin claims things endure for a moment (*kṣaṇa*). Nāgārjuna applies the same regress logic: Does the "Moment of Duration" itself endure? If yes, it needs a duration-of-duration. If no, it perishes instantly and cannot serve as a support.

---

## Verse 7.14
**utpādaś ca sthitiś caiva nirodhaś caiṣa lakṣaṇam |**
**lakṣyasya cānupapattiḥ syāt tribhir lakṣaṇa-lakṣitaiḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Arising, duration, and cessation are [supposed to be] the characteristics.
But if the characterized (*lakṣya*) is not established, how can there be what is characterized by these three characteristics?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Lakṣaṇa-Lakṣya** ("Characteristic/Characterized"): A characteristic (e.g., Heat) needs a substrate (e.g., Fire). If Arising is a characteristic, what is the substrate?
    *   If the substrate *exists* before Arising, it doesn't need to arise.
    *   If it *doesn't exist*, the characteristic has nowhere to land.

---

## Verse 7.20
**na san nāsan na sad-asan nāpy anubhayataḥ |**
**jāyate jātu kiṃcit kutaścit kasyacit kvacit ||**

**Translation**:
"Neither from an existent, nor from a non-existent, nor from both, nor from neither,
Does anything ever arise from anything, belonging to anyone, anywhere."

**Commentary**:
*   **Catuṣkoṭi**: This verse repeats the famous formula from **Chapter 1.1**, confirming that the analysis of the *Conditioned* (*saṃskṛta*) leads back to the analysis of *Conditions* (*pratyaya*). Causality itself is the target.

---

## Verse 7.33
**utpādasthitibhaṅgānām asiddher nāsti saṃskṛtam |**
**saṃskṛtasyāprasiddhau ca katham setsyaty asaṃskṛtam ||**

**Translation**:
"Since arising, duration, and cessation are not established, the conditioned does not exist.
And if the conditioned is not established, how will the unconditioned be established?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Saṃskṛta vs. Asaṃskṛta**: This is the crucial soteriological point.
    *   **Abhidharma View**: We escape the Conditioned (*Samsara*) to reach the Unconditioned (*Nirvana*).
    *   **Madhyamaka View**: If the Conditioned is an illusion (like a dream), you don't need to "escape" it. You just need to wake up.
    *   **Prasannapadā**: "The Unconditioned is merely the negation of the Conditioned. If the Conditioned is a hare's horn (non-existent), the Unconditioned is the 'non-existence of the hare's horn'—equally conceptual." Thus, Nirvana is also empty of *svabhāva*.

## Verse 7.34
**māyāvad gandharvanagaram vad svapnādikam yathā |**
**tathā sarve saṃskārāḥ kalpayitavyāś ca pṛthak pṛthak ||**

**Translation**:
"Like an illusion, like a city of Gandharvas, like a dream and the like—
Thus should all conditioned formations be conceived, each and every one."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Three Similes**:
    1.  **Māyā** (Illusion): It appears real but has no substance (deceptive nature).
    2.  **Gandharva-nagara** (Mirage City): It looks like a destination/refuge, but you can never enter it.
    3.  **Svapna** (Dream): It evokes real emotions (fear/desire) despite having no object.
*   **Conclusion**: Conditioned things function causally (conventionally) without having intrinsic being (ultimately).# Chapter 8: Examination of Action and Agent (Karmakāraka-parīkṣā)

## Introduction

Chapter 8, *Karmakāraka-parīkṣā*, represents a critical application of Nāgārjuna's dialectical method to the core components of ethical and soteriological thought: **action** (*karma*) and the **agent** who performs it (*kāraka*). 

Building upon the analysis of conditioned factors (*saṃskāra*) in Chapter 7 and the relationship between the characterized and the characteristic in Chapter 5, this chapter directly addresses the **Abhidharmic ontology** of real (*dravya*) entities underlying moral responsibility. The central dilemma: if agent and action are each intrinsically real, how do they relate? If identical, the distinction collapses. If different, their connection is inexplicable.

This analysis is crucial for Buddhist ethics: karma requires an agent and action, but neither can be found with *svabhāva*. The chapter demonstrates that moral responsibility is possible precisely *because* of emptiness—not despite it.

## Kārikā 8.1

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*kārakaḥ sa iti jñeyo yaś ca kuryāt sa eva hi |*
*kṛtaṃ tat karma vijñeyaṃ yena tat kriyate'khilam ||*

**Translation**:
The agent¹ is to be understood as that [being] who would do [something]. That which is done² completely by that [agent] is to be understood as the action.

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
Candrakīrti opens by stating the conventional definitions. The agent is identified by what it does; the action is identified by who does it. The question: can these definitions survive ultimate analysis?

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Sanskrit] *kāraka* (कारक): Agent, doer; grammatically, the instrumental case in action.
² [Sanskrit] *karma* (कर्म): Action, deed; also the object of the verb in Sanskrit grammar.

---

## Kārikā 8.2

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*kārakaḥ pūrvam utpanno yaḥ kurvīta yathā kvacit |*
*kārakāt karma niṣpannaṃ yadi kārakaḥ syād akarmakaḥ ||*

**Translation**:
If the agent arises first¹ and would then do [something]—if action were accomplished [only] from an agent—then the agent would be without action.²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
If the agent exists as a completed entity *before* acting, then at that moment it is "action-less" (*akarmaka*). But what makes it an "agent" if it has no action? The very designation depends on the presence of action.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Dialectical] Temporal priority dilemma: same as MMK 6 with desire/desirous.
² [Philosophical] An "agent without action" is a contradiction in terms—like a "mover without motion."

---

## Kārikā 8.3

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*karma pūrvaṃ bhaved yadi tataḥ kartā kutaḥ param |*
*akartṛkaṃ bhavet karma yadi karma kathaṃ bhavet ||*

**Translation**:
If action were prior,¹ then from what [source] would there be an agent? If action were without an agent,² how could there be action?

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
The reverse problem: if action exists first, it floats free of any subject. But action without someone doing it is meaningless—"walking" without a walker.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Sanskrit] *karma pūrvam*: "action first"—action temporally preceding agent.
² [Sanskrit] *akartṛka* (अकर्तृक): "without an agent."

---

## Kārikā 8.4

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*kārakāt karma nirmuktaṃ na ca kārakas tato bhavet |*
*tathā karmaiva kāryaṃ syān na ca kārya vinā bhavet ||*

**Translation**:
Action freed from the agent¹ does not exist; nor does the agent [exist independently] therefrom. Similarly, action itself would be the product,² but there is no product without [action].

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
The mutual dependence is fully exposed. Neither can stand alone. They require each other for their very identity.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Philosophical] *nirmuktam*: "freed from," "apart from"—testing independent existence.
² [Sanskrit] *kārya* (कार्य): Effect, product, what is to be done.

---

## Kārikā 8.5

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*kārakaḥ karma ca dvayaṃ saṃsṛtau hetuḥ iṣyate |*
*tau cen mithyā kathaṃ hetuḥ mithyayoḥ syāt phalaṃ param ||*

**Translation**:
The agent and action, [this] pair, are accepted as the cause of saṃsāra.¹ But if these two are unreal, how could the fruit [arise] from unreal [causes]?²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
Candrakīrti anticipates the opponent's objection: "If agent and action are empty, karma-theory collapses!" The answer: emptiness doesn't mean non-existence; it means lack of *svabhāva*. Conventional causation remains.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Sanskrit] *saṃsāra* (संसार): Cyclic existence, the round of rebirths.
² [Dialectical] This is the opponent's fear of nihilism—addressed in following verses.

---

## Kārikā 8.6

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*phalasya syād asadbhāvo yathā hetvartha iṣyate |*
*hetoś ca syād asadbhāvaḥ phalaḥ syāt katham anyathā ||*

**Translation**:
Just as the existence of the fruit¹ [depends on] the cause, so the cause [depends on] the fruit. How could the fruit be otherwise [than dependently existent]?²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
The solution: both cause and fruit are dependently arisen. Neither is independently real. This *is* the Middle Way—avoiding both eternalism (they're real) and nihilism (nothing exists).

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Sanskrit] *phala* (फल): Fruit, result, karmic outcome.
² [Philosophical] Mutual dependence is the very structure of conventional reality.

---

## Kārikā 8.7

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*tathā kārakakarmaṇoḥ pratyekaṃ siddhi nāsti hi |*
*itaretarataḥ siddhir iti cen nāyam īpsitam ||*

**Translation**:
Thus, individually there is no establishment of agent and action.¹ If [you say] they are established mutually from each other,² this is not desirable.

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
The opponent might try: "They establish each other!" But this is *anyonyāśraya*—mutual dependence—which the opponent cannot accept if they insist on *svabhāva*.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Dialectical] Neither agent nor action can be found independently.
² [Sanskrit] *itaretarataḥ*: "from each other," mutually.

---

## Kārikā 8.8

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*naikatvena na nānātve kārakakarmaṇoḥ sthitiḥ |*
*ekāntena vinā cāpi sthitir nopapadyate ||*

**Translation**:
The position of agent and action is not [established] through identity nor through difference.¹ And without either extreme, [their] position is not tenable.²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
The characteristic Mādhyamaka move: identity collapses the distinction; difference severs the relation. Neither works for intrinsically real entities.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Philosophical] The *ekatva-nānātva* (identity-difference) analysis from MMK 6.
² [Cross-reference] Same logic applied to desire/desirous (Ch. 6), fire/fuel (Ch. 10).

---

## Kārikā 8.9

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*naikatvena ca kāryaṃ syān nānātvenāpi kā gatiḥ |*
*dvābhyāṃ na syād ubhābhyāṃ vā na ca syāt tadvinā punaḥ ||*

**Translation**:
The product is not [established] through identity, nor through difference—what possibility is there?¹ It is not [established] through both, nor without both.²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
The tetralemma is applied to the *kārya* (product/effect) as well. All four logical positions fail.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Sanskrit] *gati* (गति): Course, possibility, meaning.
² [Philosophical] *Catuṣkoṭi* applied: neither same, different, both, nor neither.

---

## Kārikā 8.10

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*etena hetuphalayoḥ kramaḥ siddho na vidyate |*
*yadi kramaḥ pūrvāparaḥ syād anyonyata eva vā ||*

**Translation**:
By this [analysis], no sequence of cause and result is found to be established¹—whether [the sequence is] prior-and-posterior or mutual.²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
The temporal and logical ordering of cause and effect also fails. Neither "cause first, then effect" nor "they arise together" can be coherently maintained for intrinsically real entities.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Dialectical] The sequence (*krama*) presupposes what it's trying to establish.
² [Cross-reference] Parallels MMK 1 on causation; MMK 7 on arising.

---

## Kārikā 8.11

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*kārakakarmavimuktau tu na ca vedanā sthitau |*
*sākṣiṇī vedanā cet syāt kārakasyāpi sākṣiṇī ||*

**Translation**:
If freed from agent and action, feeling¹ [too] would not be established. If feeling were a witness, it would be a witness of the agent also.²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
The analysis extends to *vedanā* (feeling)—one of the five aggregates. If agent and action are empty, so is the one who experiences. This does not negate experience; it clarifies its dependent nature.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Sanskrit] *vedanā* (वेदना): Feeling, sensation; one of the five *skandhas*.
² [Philosophical] The "witness" (experiencer) is also dependently arisen.

---

## Kārikā 8.12

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*evaṃ kārakakarmaṇoḥ śūnyatāyāṃ prasādhite |*
*sarvabhāvānāṃ śūnyatvaṃ draṣṭavyaṃ tena hetunā ||*

**Translation**:
Thus, when the emptiness of agent and action is established, the emptiness of all entities¹ should be seen by that very reasoning.²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
The chapter concludes with universalization. The agent-action analysis is a model for understanding *all* phenomena. What applies here applies everywhere.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Sanskrit] *sarvabhāvānām*: "of all entities/phenomena."
² [Soteriological] This seeing (*draṣṭavyam*) is liberating insight—not mere theory.

## Scholarly Apparatus

### Key Concepts

| Term | Sanskrit | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| **kāraka** | कारक | Agent, doer; the instrumental factor in action |
| **karma** | कर्म | Action, deed; also karmic act and its residue |
| **kārya** | कार्य | Effect, product; what is accomplished |
| **akarmaka** | अकर्मक | Without action; actionless |
| **akartṛka** | अकर्तृक | Without agent; agentless |
| **saṃsāra** | संसार | Cyclic existence; rounds of rebirth |
| **phala** | फल | Fruit, result; karmic outcome |
| **vedanā** | वेदना | Feeling, sensation |

### Argument Structure

**Pūrvapakṣa (Opponent's Position)**:
The Abhidharma holds that agents and actions are real *dharmas*. The agent is the kāraka-factor in a karmic event; the action is the karma. These must be genuinely distinct yet genuinely related for moral responsibility to function.

**Mādhyamaka Response**:

1. **Temporal Priority Fails** (8.2-3): Neither agent nor action can be prior to the other without losing its definition.

2. **Identity/Difference Fails** (8.4, 8.8-9): If identical, no distinction; if different, no connection.

3. **Mutual Dependence Exposed** (8.6-7): They are established only in relation to each other—*pratītyasamutpanna*.

4. **Emptiness Saves Karma** (8.5-6, 8.12): Emptiness doesn't destroy karma-theory; it provides its only coherent foundation.

5. **Universalization** (8.12): This analysis applies to all phenomena.

### Cross-References

## Verse 9.1

### I. Source Text
**darśanaśravaṇādīni vedanādīni cāpy atha |**
**bhaṅgādīnīti cāpy eṣāṃ tatteṣām asti no vā ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"Seeing, hearing, and the like; as well as feeling and the like;
And the destroyed [elements] and the like—does 'That' [the Prior Entity] belong to them, or not?"

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Darśana-śravaṇa-ādīni** ("Seeing, hearing, etc."): Refers to the six sense faculties (*indriya*) and their operations. The opponent argues these are instruments (*karaṇa*), implying an agent (*kartṛ*). *Note: The argument hinges on the grammatical requirement that an instrument (e.g., a telescope) requires a user. Nāgārjuna denies this duality.*
*   **Vedanādīni** ("Feeling, etc."): Refers to the five aggregates (*skandha*), specifically the mental factors that accompany experience.
*   **Tat-teṣām** ("That of them"): "That" (*tat*) refers to the *Pūrva* (Prior Entity/Self). The genitive *teṣām* ("of them") indicates possession. The question is ontological: Does a possessor exist prior to the possessed?

### IV. The Blues Interpretation
**Title: "Nobody Before the Blues"**

(Verse 1)
They say there’s a Watcher waitin' ‘fore the sun comes up,
(Yeah, some secret soul pourin' coffee in the cup)
But if nobody’s tastin’, tell me who’s to blame?
Without the hurtin’, baby, you ain't got no name.

---

## Verse 9.2

### I. Source Text
**teṣāṃ caiva bhaved bhāvaḥ kas teṣāṃ ca bhaviṣyati |**
**darśanaśravaṇādīni vedanādīni cāpy atha ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"If 'That' [the Entity] were to exist [prior], how could it exist for them?
[And if it exists through them], then seeing, hearing, and the like [would exist independent of it]."

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Bhaved bhāvaḥ** ("Were to exist"): Conditional tense. Nāgārjuna grants the premise for the sake of argument.
*   **Kas teṣāṃ** ("Who for them?"): If the Soul exists *before* seeing, it is blind. How can a blind Soul be the "Seer" of seeing? The relationship of appropriation (*upādāna*) is impossible without the appropriated (*upādeya*).

### IV. The Blues Interpretation

(Verse 2)
If you sittin' in the dark before you turn the light,
(Tell me, brother, are you blind or is it night?)
You claim you’re the Singer before you sing the song,
But a ghost without a guitar can’t play along.

---

## Verse 9.3

### I. Source Text
**atha kaścid bhaved bhāvaḥ prāk tebhyo 'sti sa kiṃ mataḥ |**
**sa ca taṃ parigṛhṇīyād bhāvo bhāvaṃ hi kasya cit ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"If some entity were to exist prior to those [faculties], what is it considered to be?
And [if] that entity appropriates them, then indeed, that entity belongs to whom?"

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Prāk** ("Prior"): The central target of this chapter. Temporal priority implies ontological independence.
*   **Parigṛhṇīyād** ("Should appropriate"): From root *grah* (to grasp). The Self is defined as the *grasper* of the aggregates. But if the grasper exists before the grasping, what is it grasping?

### IV. The Blues Interpretation

(Verse 3)
You say you’re the Driver before you bought the car,
(Standin' on the corner, wishin' on a star)
But if you ain't got no wheels, you ain't grabbin' the street,
Can’t own the rhythm, Lord, without the beat.

---

## Verse 9.4

### I. Source Text
**pṛthag bhāvo 'samāptaś ca na deśo 'sti na kālaḥ |**
**na bhāvaḥ kuta evāsya pṛthag bhāvo bhaviṣyati ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"A separate entity is not established; neither place nor time exists [for it].
If the entity does not exist [independently], how can a separate entity come to be?"

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Pṛthag bhāva** ("Separate entity"): The Soul/Self (*ātman*) posited as existing apart from the aggregates.
*   **Asamāpta** ("Not concluded/established"): Without the characteristics of seeing, etc., the entity has no definition. It is a "sky-flower."

### IV. The Blues Interpretation

(Verse 4)
You say you’re the Captain, separate from the ship,
(Standin' on dry land while the vessel takes a dip)
But a Captain with no boat, Lord, he ain't got no crew,
You’re just a lonely shadow with nothin' left to do.

---

## Verse 9.5

### I. Source Text
**yadi ca syāt pṛthag bhāvo darśanādeḥ pṛthak tataḥ |**
**syāt pṛthag darśanādy eva bhāvena tu vinā bhavet ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"And if a separate entity were to exist, distinct from seeing and so forth,
Then seeing and so forth would exist separately, existing indeed without that entity."

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Vinā bhavet** ("Would exist without"): The consequence of dualism. If the Self is independent of Seeing, then Seeing should function without a Self. But "seeing without a seer" is absurd to the opponent.

### IV. The Blues Interpretation

(Verse 5)
If the Blues can hurt you when you ain't around,
(Like a ghost guitar makin' a lonesome sound)
Then the pain don't need you, baby, to make it real,
It’s just a broken heart that forgot how to feel.

---

## Verse 9.6

### I. Source Text
**kasya cit kim cid evāsti na ca bhāvo 'sti kasya cit |**
**na ca bhāvena vināsti darśanādi kuto bhavet ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"Someone has something, but no entity belongs to anyone.
And without an entity, seeing and so forth does not exist; whence could it arise?"

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Kasya cit** ("Of someone"): The grammatical relation of possession requires two terms. If the "Owner" is a fiction, the "Owned" (the eye, the ear) loses its status as an instrument.

### IV. The Blues Interpretation

(Verse 6)
You say "This is my hammer," you say "This is my song,"
(But tell me, Mr. Owner, where do you belong?)
If there ain't no "You," there ain't no "Mine,"
Just empty boxcars rollin' down the line.

---

## Verse 9.7

### I. Source Text
**na ca bhāvo 'sti bāhyo 'pi na ca bhāvo 'sti cāntaraḥ |**
**na cāsti bhāvo bāhyo 'pi kuto bhāvo bhaviṣyati ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"The entity implies neither an external nor an internal existence.
And neither does the external entity exist; whence will the entity exist?"

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Bāhyo/Antaraḥ** ("External/Internal"): The Self is not outside the aggregates (like a Pilot) nor inside them (like a Seed).

### IV. The Blues Interpretation

(Verse 7)
I checked the front porch, I checked the kitchen floor,
(Looking for the Man who don't live here no more)
He ain't outside knocking, he ain't inside hidin',
Just a rumour of a Ghost that we all abidin'.

---

## Verse 9.8

### I. Source Text
**evam eva hi sarveṣāṃ gamanaṃ pratiṣidhyate |**
**gantā ca gamanād anyo nanyas tasmān na vidyate ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"In this very way, the going of all [senses] is refuted.
The goer is not other than the going, nor is he non-other; thus he is not found."

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Gantā/Gamana** ("Goer/Going"): Nāgārjuna recycles the argument from Chapter 2 (*Gatāgata-parīkṣā*). The Agent (*kartṛ*) cannot be established as identical to nor distinct from the Action (*kriyā*).

### IV. The Blues Interpretation

(Verse 8)
You can't have a Walker if the Road is gone,
(Can't have a Singer if there ain't no Song)
If you ain't movin', baby, you ain't standin' still,
Just a imaginary figure on a imaginary hill.

---

## Verse 9.9

### I. Source Text
**gantā ca gamanād anyo nanyas tasmān na vidyate |**
**gamanāny api sarvāṇi gatyā gatir nivāryate ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"The goer is not other than the going, nor is he non-other; thus he is not found.
All goings are prevented by the [analysis of] going by means of going."

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Na vidyate** ("Is not found"): The final ontological dismissal. The Agent is a conceptual fiction imputed upon the stream of action.

### IV. The Blues Interpretation

(Verse 9)
I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride,
(Looked in the mirror, but there was no one inside)
I ain't the Walker, Lord, and I ain't the Road,
Just a heavy burden without no heavy load.

---

## Verse 9.10-9.12 (Conclusion)

### I. Source Text
**tasmād darśanādīni vedanādīni cāpy atha |**
**bhaṅgādīnīti cāpy eṣāṃ tatteṣām asti no vā ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"Therefore, seeing and the like, and feeling and the like,
And the destroyed elements—'That' [Prior Entity] does not exist for them."

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Tasmād** ("Therefore"): Conclusion (*nigamana*).
*   **Asti no vā** ("Exists or not"): The dilemma is resolved by negation. The *Pūrva* (Prior Self) is a conceptual fiction (*prapañca*).

### IV. The Blues Interpretation

(Verse 10-12)
So pack up your suitcase, leave your name behind,
(There ain't no "Me" that the devil can find)
The seeing happens, baby, but the Seer is gone,
Just the morning light breakin' on the dawn.# Madhyamakashāstra Chapter 10: Examination of Fire and Fuel (Agnīndhana-parīkṣā)
**Translator**: The Professor (Dr. Rajesh Patel)
**Status**: Scholarly Edition (Revised)

---

## Verse 10.1
**yad indhanaṃ sa evāgnir ekatvaṃ kartṛkarmaṇoḥ |**
**anyaś ced indhanād agnir indhanād apy ṛte bhavet ||**

**Translation**:
"If the fuel were the fire, there would be identity between the agent and the object.
If the fire were distinct from the fuel, it would exist even without the fuel."

**Commentary**:
*   **Kartṛ-karmaṇoḥ** ("Agent and Object"): *Agni* (Fire) acts upon *Indhana* (Fuel). If they are identical (*ekatva*), the burner burns itself. This mirrors the Self (*kartṛ*) acting on the Aggregates (*karma*).
*   **Ṛte bhavet** ("Would exist without"): The consequence of dualism. A fire independent of fuel is a logical impossibility, yet implied by "difference."

---

## Verse 10.2
**nityapradīpta eva syād apradīpanahetukaḥ |**
**punarārambhavaiyarthyam evaṃ cākarmakaḥ sati ||**

**Translation**:
"[If distinct], it would be eternally burning; it would not have ignition as its cause.
The futility of re-ignition [would follow], and being thus, it would be without action."

**Commentary**:
*   **Nitya-pradīpta** ("Eternally burning"): If Fire doesn't need Fuel to exist, it shouldn't need Fuel to *start* burning. It would be an eternal, uncaused entity (*svabhāva*).
*   **Akarmaka** ("Without action"): It would have no work (*burning*) to do.

---

## Verse 10.3
**paratra nirapekṣatvād apradīpanahetukaḥ |**
**punarārambhavaiyarthyaṃ nityadīptaḥ prasajyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Due to independence from another, it would not have ignition as its cause.
The futility of re-ignition implies it is eternally burning."

**Commentary**:
*   **Paratra nirapekṣatvād** ("Due to independence from the other"): Reiterating the absurdity of independence. A Self independent of the Body/Mind would be immutable and unaffected by karma.

---

## Verse 10.4
**tatraitasmād idhmād anyo yadi syād agnir īkṣyate |**
**indhanena samīpyeta na cainam upadhakṣyati ||**

**Translation**:
"In that case, if fire is observed to be other than this fuel,
It might meet with the fuel, but it would not burn it."

**Commentary**:
*   **Samīpyeta** ("Might meet"): Mere contact (*sparśa*). If they are fundamentally different substances (like a pot and a cloth), they can touch, but one cannot consume the other.

---

## Verse 10.5
**anyo na prāpnuyān nāprāpto dahati ceṣyate |**
**na cā nirvāpayed agnir na tiṣṭhet svasvalakṣaṇaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Being other, it would not reach [the fuel]; and not reaching it, it is not admitted to burn.
And the fire would not be extinguished; it would stand with its own specific characteristic."

**Commentary**:
*   **Svasvalakṣaṇa** ("Own specific characteristic"): If Fire is separate, it retains its "heat" forever, never transforming into ash or cooling down. It becomes frozen in its nature.

---

## Verse 10.6
**anyo na prāpnuyān nāprāpto dahati ceṣyate |**
**strī saṃprāpnoti puruṣaṃ puruṣaś ca striyaṃ yathā ||**

**Translation**:
"Being other, it would not reach... [reiteration].
[The opponent says:] Just as a woman reaches a man, and a man reaches a woman."

**Commentary**:
*   **Strī/Puruṣa** ("Woman/Man"): The opponent uses an analogy of two distinct agents meeting. Nāgārjuna rejects this: Men and Women retain their identity after meeting; they do not consume each other. Fire, however, consumes Fuel; its existence depends on the transformation of the other. Thus, mere "meeting" of distinct entities is a false analogy.

---

## Verse 10.7
**anyad anyena saṃprāptaṃ yadi syād agnīndhanam |**
**syātāṃ prāpya tu na dahyetām anyenānyasya dahanāt ||**

**Translation**:
"If fire and fuel were separate, and one reached the other,
Then upon reaching, they would exist [unchanged]; for nothing burns what is other than itself."

**Commentary**:
*   **Na dahyetām** ("Would not burn"): If A is intrinsically different from B, A cannot essentialize/transmute B. Intrinsic nature (*svabhāva*) is immutable.

## Verse 10.8
**yad indhanam apekṣyāgnir apekṣyāgnim yad indhanam |**
**katarat pūrvaniṣpannaṃ yad apekṣyāgnir indhanam ||**

**Translation**:
"If fire depends on fuel, and fuel depends on fire—
Which one is established prior, on which the fire depends?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Pūrva-niṣpanna** ("Established prior"): The circularity trap. To have a dependency (*apekṣā*), one term must exist to depend on the other. Who starts the cycle?

---

## Verse 10.9
**yad indhanam apekṣyāgnir agneḥ siddhasya sādhanam |**
**evaṃ satīndhanaṃ cāpi bhaviṣyati niragnikam ||**

**Translation**:
"If fire depends on fuel, there is the establishment of an already established fire.
And in that case, fuel also would exist without fire."

**Commentary**:
*   **Agneḥ siddhasya** ("Of established fire"): If Fire exists *to* depend on Fuel, it must already exist. Why then does it need Fuel?
*   **Niragnikam** ("Fire-less"): If Fuel is waiting for Fire, it exists as a substance independent of burning. But wood is not "fuel" until it burns.

---

## Verse 10.10
**yo 'pekṣya sidhyate bhāvas tam evāpekṣya sidhyati |**
**yadi yo 'pekṣitavyaḥ sa sidhyatāṃ kamapekṣya kaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"If an entity is established depending on [another], and that [other] is established depending on [the first]—
If the one to be depended upon is [yet] to be established, depending on what does which one [arise]?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Kam apekṣya kaḥ** ("Depending on what does which?"): The classic "Father and Son" paradox. A father makes a son, but a son makes a man a "father." Neither has priority.

---

## Verse 10.11
**yo 'pekṣya sidhyate bhāvaḥ so 'siddho 'pekṣate katham |**
**athāpy api siddhaḥ sa 'pekṣate kim apekṣate ||**

**Translation**:
"If an entity to be established depends [on another], how does it depend if it is unestablished?
And if it is established, what does it depend on?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Asiddhaḥ** ("Unestablished"): A non-existent thing cannot "depend" on anything. A rabbit's horn cannot depend on a rabbit.
*   **Siddhaḥ** ("Established"): An existing thing needs no support.

---

## Verse 10.12
**apekṣyendhanam agnir na nānalekṣyāgnir indhanam |**
**apekṣyendhanaṃ nāgnir na nānalekṣyāgnim indhanam ||**

**Translation**:
"Fire does not depend on fuel; nor does fire not depend on fuel.
Fuel does not depend on fire; nor does fuel not depend on fire."

**Commentary**:
*   **Na... na** ("Neither... nor"): The rejection of all four positions (*catuṣkoṭi* negation). Dependency is empty; Independence is empty.

---

## Verse 10.13
**āgacchaty anyato nāgnir indhane 'gnir na vidyate |**
**atrenandhanam śeṣaṃ gamyamānagatāgataiḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Fire does not come from elsewhere; and fire is not found in the fuel.
Here, the remainder regarding fuel [is explained] by the 'being gone to,' 'gone,' and 'not gone.'"

**Commentary**:
*   **Gamyamāna...** ("Being gone to..."): Reference to Chapter 2 (*Gatāgata*). Just as "motion" is not in the path, "burning" is not in the wood.

---

## Verse 10.14
**indhanaṃ punar agnir na nāgnir anyatra cendhanāt |**
**nāgnir indhanavān nāgnāv indhanāni na teṣu saḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Fuel is not fire; fire does not exist elsewhere than fuel.
Fire does not possess fuel; fuel is not in fire, nor is it in them."

**Commentary**:
*   **Indhanavān** ("Possessing fuel"): Rejection of the Self "possessing" aggregates.
*   **Na teṣu saḥ** ("He is not in them"): Rejection of the Self as a container for aggregates.

---

## Verse 10.15
**agnīndhanābhyāṃ vyākhyāta ātmopādānayoḥ kramaḥ |**
**sarvo niravaśeṣeṇa sārdhaṃ ghaṭapaṭādibhiḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"By [the analysis of] fire and fuel, the procedure for [analyzing] Self and Appropriation is explained;
All [views], without remainder, together with [views on] pot, cloth, and so forth."

**Commentary**:
*   **Ātma-upādāna** ("Self and Appropriation"): The target. Fire = Self; Fuel = Five Aggregates.
*   **Ghaṭa-paṭa** ("Pot and Cloth"): The method extends to all objects. There is no "Pot-essence" apart from clay. *See also Chapter 5 (Dhātu-parīkṣā) where the separation of space and its characteristic is refuted using similar logic.*

---

## Verse 10.16
**ātmanas ca satattvaṃ ye bhāvānāṃ ca pṛthak pṛthak |**
**nirdiśanti na tān manye śāsanasyārthakovidān ||**

**Translation**:
"Those who teach the reality of the Self and of entities separately—
I do not consider them to be experts in the meaning of the Teaching."

**Commentary**:
*   **Artha-kovidān** ("Experts in meaning"): A sharp rebuke. Dualists (Sāṃkhyas, Naiyāyikas, and Abhidharmikas who reify dharmas) miss the Buddha's intent. Emptiness is the true Teaching.# Madhyamakashāstra Chapter 11: Examination of Prior and Posterior Limits (Pūrvāpara-koṭi-parīkṣā)

## Verse 11.1
**pūrvā prajñāyate koṭir nety uvāca mahāmuniḥ |**
**saṃsāro 'navarāgro hi nāsyādir nāpi paścimam ||**

**Translation**:
" 'A prior limit is not discerned'—so spoke the Great Sage.
Samsara is indeed without beginning or end; it has no beginning nor a posterior [end]."

**Commentary**:
*   **Mahāmuniḥ** ("The Great Sage"): Reference to the Buddha (specifically *Samyutta Nikaya* 15.1). Nāgārjuna cites scripture (*āgama*) to establish the premise of *anavarāgra* (without beginning or end).
*   **Koṭi** ("Limit/Edge"): The temporal boundary. If Samsara had a start, it would have a "first cause," violating dependent origination (*pratītyasamutpāda*). A first cause implies an uncaused entity, which is impossible in a system where everything arises in dependence on conditions.

---

## Verse 11.2
**naivāgraṃ nāvaraṃ yasya tasya madhyaṃ kuto bhavet |**
**tasmān nātropapadyante pūrvāparasahakramāḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Of that which has no beginning and no end, how could there be a middle?
Therefore, sequences of prior, posterior, and simultaneous do not logically obtain here."

**Commentary**:
*   **Madhyaṃ** ("Middle"): A middle is defined by its relation to start and finish. Without edges, the center collapses. Time itself is deconstructed.

---

## Verse 11.3
**pūrvam jātir yadi bhaved jarāmaraṇam uttaram |**
**nirjarāmaraṇā jātir bhavej jāteś ca saṃbhavaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"If birth were prior and old-age-and-death posterior,
Then birth would be free from old-age-and-death, and there would be an arising of [an immortal] birth."

**Commentary**:
*   **Nir-jarāmaraṇā** ("Free from aging/death"): If Birth exists as a discrete block of time *before* Death enters, then for that duration, the being is immortal. But birth *is* the onset of aging.

---

## Verse 11.4
**paścāj jātir yadi bhaved jarāmaraṇam āditāḥ |**
**ahetukam ajātaṃ syāj jarāmaraṇam idṛśam ||**

**Translation**:
"If birth were posterior and old-age-and-death from the beginning,
Then old-age-and-death would be uncaused and unborn; such [would be the case]."

**Commentary**:
*   **Ahetukam** ("Uncaused"): How can one die if one hasn't been born yet? Placing death first breaks the causal chain.

---

## Verse 11.5
**na jarāmaraṇenaiva jātiś ca saha yujyate |**
**mriyeta jāyamānaś ca syāc cāhetukatobhayoh ||**

**Translation**:
"Nor is birth logically conjoined simultaneously with old-age-and-death.
[Otherwise], one who is being born would be dying, and both would be without cause."

**Commentary**:
*   **Saha** ("Simultaneous"): If they happen at the exact same instant, they cannot act as cause and effect (which requires temporal succession). It implies a chaotic simultaneity where birth provides no support for death.

---

## Verse 11.6
**yatra na prabhavanty ete pūrvāparasahakramāḥ |**
**prapañcayanti tāṃ jātiṃ taj jarāmaraṇaṃ ca kim ||**

**Translation**:
"Where these sequences of prior, posterior, and simultaneous do not obtain—
Why do they conceptually proliferate [views about] that birth and that old-age-and-death?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Prapañcayanti** ("Conceptualize/Proliferate"): Despite the logical impossibility of ordering them, fools continue to build theories about "Life" and "Death" as real entities.

---

## Verse 11.7
**kāryaṃ ca kāraṇaṃ caiva lakṣyaṃ lakṣaṇam eva ca |**
**vedanā vedakaś caiva santy arthā ye ca kecana ||**

**Translation**:
"[The same applies to] effect and cause, and characterized and characteristic,
And feeling and the feeler, and whatever other objects exist."

**Commentary**:
*   **Atideśa** ("Extension"): This verse employs the principle of *atideśa*, extending the *anavarāgra* (beginningless) argument to all dyads. Cause/Effect, Subject/Object—none can be established as having a "first" starting point without falling into the paradoxes of priority, posteriority, or simultaneity.

---

## Verse 11.8
**pūrvā na vidyate koṭiḥ saṃsārasya na kevalam |**
**sarveṣām api bhāvānāṃ pūrvā koṭir na vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"A prior limit is not found, not only of Samsara;
Also of all entities, a prior limit is not found."

**Commentary**:
*   **Sarveṣām bhāvānāṃ** ("Of all entities"): The grand conclusion. Nothing has a beginning. Every phenomenon is part of an infinite web of mutual dependence without a genesis point (*ādī*).# Madhyamakashāstra Chapter 12: Examination of Suffering (Duḥkha-parīkṣā)

## Verse 12.1
**svayaṃ kṛtaṃ parakṛtaṃ dvābhyāṃ kṛtam ahetukam |**
**duḥkham ity eka icchanti tac ca kāryaṃ na yujyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Some wish [to assert] that suffering is self-made, other-made, made by both, or uncaused.
But that [assertion] as an effect is not logical."

**Commentary**:
*   **Catuṣkoṭi** ("Four Corners/Tetralemma"): The classic Indian logical apparatus used to exhaust all possible conceptual positions.
    1.  *Svayaṃ kṛta* (Self-made): Sāṃkhya view (Effect pre-exists in cause).
    2.  *Parakṛta* (Other-made): Buddhist Abhidharma/Vaiśeṣika view (Cause is external to effect).
    3.  *Dvābhyām* (Both): Jaina/Syncretic view.
    4.  *Ahetuka* (Uncaused): Cārvāka/Materialist view (Random chance).
*   **Na yujyate** ("Is not logical"): Nāgārjuna rejects all four substantialist views.

---

## Verse 12.2
**svayaṃ kṛtaṃ yadi bhavet prapadyeta na tat svayam |**
**skandhān imān amī skandhāḥ saṃbhavanti svayaṃ kṛtāḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"If it were self-made, then it would not arise from itself.
These aggregates arise from those [previous] aggregates; [thus] they are [conventionally] self-made."

**Commentary**:
*   **Svayaṃ kṛta** ("Self-made"): If A creates A, A must exist before A exists (infinite regress).
*   **Skandhān** ("Aggregates"): Suffering is identified with the aggregates (*upādāna-skandha*). Since present aggregates arise from past aggregates (karma), there is causal continuity, but not identity of a static "Self."

---

## Verse 12.3
**yady amībhyo hi skandhebhyo hy anye skandhāḥ pare yadi |**
**syāt parakṛtaṃ duḥkhaṃ parair ebhiḥ kṛtaṃ hi tat ||**

**Translation**:
"If these aggregates were distinct from those [previous] aggregates,
Then suffering would be other-made, for it would be made by those 'others'."

**Commentary**:
*   **Pare** ("Others"): If the "Past Self" and "Present Self" are totally distinct entities (like two different people), then my karma would be experienced by someone else (*akṛtābhyāgama* - experiencing results of actions one didn't do). This destroys moral responsibility.

---

## Verse 12.4
**svapudgalakṛtaṃ duḥkhaṃ yadi duḥkhaṃ punar vinā |**
**svapudgalena sa kaḥ syād yena duḥkhaṃ svayaṃ kṛtam ||**

**Translation**:
"If suffering were made by one's own person (*pudgala*), then without that suffering,
Who would be that own-person by whom suffering is self-made?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Pudgala** ("Person"): Distinct from *ātman* (Eternal Soul). The *pudgala* is the term used by the Pudgalavādins (Personalists) to posit a carrier of karma that is neither identical to nor different from the aggregates. Nāgārjuna treats it here as a functional agent. If this Agent exists *before* the suffering (the act/experience), what defines him as an agent? An agent is defined by action.

---

## Verse 12.5
**yadi puggalam utsṛjya duḥkhaṃ parakṛtaṃ bhavet |**
**duḥkhaṃ puggalam utsṛjya paras tenāpi tat kṛtam ||**

**Translation**:
"If, distinct from the person, suffering were other-made—
Then, distinct from the suffering, having discarded the person, it would be made by that 'other'."

**Commentary**:
*   **Utsṛjya** ("Having discarded/Apart from"): If the Creator (Other) exists apart from the Experiencer (Person), then suffering would float in a void, belonging to no one.

---

## Verse 12.6
**parapudgala duḥkham syād yadi kaḥ parakṛtam bhavet |**
**kena duḥkham svayaṃ kṛtam yasmāt parakṛtam bhavet ||**

**Translation**:
"If suffering were of another person, who would be the one for whom it is 'other-made'?
By whom is suffering self-made, from which it would become 'other-made'?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Paraspara-apekṣā** ("Mutual Dependence"): "Self" and "Other" are relative terms. You cannot establish "Other" without first establishing "Self." Since "Self-made" (Vs 12.2) was rejected, "Other-made" collapses.

---

## Verse 12.7
**na tāvat svakṛtaṃ duḥkhaṃ na hi tenaiva tat kṛtam |**
**paro hi duḥkhaṃ yat kuryāt tat tasya svakṛtaṃ bhavet ||**

**Translation**:
"Suffering is not self-made, for it is not made by that very same [thing].
If an 'other' were to create suffering, that would be [the other's] self-made [action]."

**Commentary**:
*   **Tenaiva tat kṛtam** ("Made by that very same"): Strict identity implies the knife cuts itself.
*   **Tasya svakṛtaṃ** ("His self-made"): If God creates my suffering, it is God's "self-made" action. So "Other-made" reduces to "Self-made" for the Other.

---

## Verse 12.8
**apekṣyāto na pūrvoktāv ubhayor na kuto bhavet |**
**na cāpy ekena kṛtaṃ dvābhyāṃ kṛtaṃ kuto bhavet ||**

**Translation**:
"Therefore, relying on the aforesaid, it is not [from either]; how could it be from both?
If it is not made by each one singly, how could it be made by both?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Dvābhyāṃ** ("By both"): Adding two impossibilities (0 + 0) does not produce a possibility (1). If Self cannot create and Other cannot create, "Both" is just a double failure.

---

## Verse 12.9
**na cāsti gaganābhāsaṃ na ca doṣaprasaṅgataḥ |**
**yadi kutaścid ākāśe duḥkham kim ahetukam ||**

**Translation**:
"Suffering does not have the appearance of the sky [eternal/uncaused], nor is it [established] through the consequence of faults.
If suffering were uncaused, would it exist anywhere in space?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Ahetukam** ("Uncaused"): If suffering had no cause, it would be eternal (like space/nirvana) or random. If random, cultivation of the Path would be useless.
*   **Doṣa-prasaṅga** ("Consequence of faults"): The fault is the rejection of the Four Noble Truths.

---

## Verse 12.10
**na kevalaṃ hi duḥkhasya cāturvidhyam na vidyate |**
**bāhyānām api bhāvānāṃ cāturvidhyam na vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Not only is the fourfold [origination] of suffering not found;
Also of external entities, the fourfold [origination] is not found."

**Commentary**:
*   **Bāhyānām** ("External things"): This analysis (Self, Other, Both, None) applies to pots, trees, and atoms. Nothing has intrinsic origination (*svabhāva-utpatti*).# Madhyamakashāstra Chapter 13: Examination of Compounded Phenomena (Saṃskāra-parīkṣā)

## Verse 13.1
**tan mṛṣā moṣadharma yad bhagavān ity abhāṣata |**
**sarve ca saṃskārās tasmān mṛṣā te moṣadharmiṇaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"That which is deceptive in nature is false—so the Blessed One spoke.
Therefore, all compounded phenomena are false, for they are deceptive in nature."

**Commentary**:
*   **Moṣadharma** ("Deceptive/Fraudulent nature"): Root *muṣ* (to steal/deceive). Compounded things appear to have a stability and reality they lack.
*   **Mṛṣā** ("False"): Not that they don't exist at all, but that they are false in their claim to intrinsic existence (*svabhāva*).

---

## Verse 13.2
**tan mṛṣā moṣadharma yad yadi kiṃ tatra muṣyate |**
**etaduktaṃ bhagavatā śūnyatāpari dīpanam ||**

**Translation**:
"If that which is deceptive in nature is false, what is it that is being deceived?
This was spoken by the Blessed One as an illumination of Emptiness."

**Commentary**:
*   **Śūnyatā-paridīpanam** ("Illumination of Emptiness"): The Buddha uses the "deception" metaphor not to posit a real deceiver or a real victim, but to point to the lack of inherent nature in the entire process.

---

## Verse 13.3
**bhāvānāṃ niḥsvabhāvatvaṃ anyathābhāvadarśanāt |**
**asvabhāvo bhāvo nāsti bhāvānāṃ śūnyatā yataḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"The absence of intrinsic nature in entities [is known] from the perception of change.
There is no entity without intrinsic nature; [but] for entities, there is emptiness."

**Commentary**:
*   **Anyathābhāva** ("Becoming otherwise/Change"): The empirical fact of change proves the absence of *svabhāva*. If a seed had the "nature" of a seed, it could never become a sprout.
*   **Niḥsvabhāvatva** ("Naturelessness"): This is synonymous with Emptiness.

---

## Verse 13.4
**kasya syād anyathābhāvaḥ svabhāvo yadi vidyate |**
**kasya syād anyathābhāvaḥ svabhāvo yadi nāsti ca ||**

**Translation**:
"Of what would there be change if intrinsic nature were to exist?
And of what would there be change if intrinsic nature were not to exist?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Paradox of Change**:
    1. If X has a fixed nature, it cannot change (by definition).
    2. If X has no nature (is a non-entity), what is there to undergo change?

---

## Verse 13.5
**tasyaiva nānyathābhāvaḥ kutaś cid anyathābhāvaḥ |**
**na hy anyasyaiva bhāvasya bhavaty anyathābhāvatā ||**

**Translation**:
"There is no change of that very same [thing]; nor is there change of [something] other.
Indeed, for an entity which is [totally] other, change does not occur."

**Commentary**:
*   **Identity vs. Difference**: Milk doesn't change into curd if they are identical (it was already curd) or if they are totally unrelated "others" (like a horse and a cow). Change requires a continuity that *svabhāva* logic cannot provide.

---

## Verse 13.6
**yuvā na jīryate tasmād vṛddhaś cāpi na jīryate |**
**yuvā na jīryate tasmād anyo yuvā na jīryate ||**

**Translation**:
"Therefore, the youth does not age; nor does the aged person age.
The youth does not age, because [being youth] he is not the aged; and another [person] does not age."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Youth Paradox**: The youth is not "aging" while he is a youth (because he is young). The old man is not "aging" because he is already old. Aging is a process that escapes reified temporal blocks.

---

## Verse 13.7
**yady aśūnyam bhavet kiṃ cic chyūnyam ity api tad bhavet |**
**na kiṃ cid asty aśūnyaṃ ca kutaḥ śūnyaṃ bhaviṣyati ||**

**Translation**:
"If there were something non-empty, then there would be something called 'empty.'
[But] there is nothing whatsoever that is non-empty; whence will there be the empty?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Relativity of Emptiness**: Emptiness is not a "thing" or a "substance." It is a conceptual designation used to negate "non-emptiness." If you can't find anything with a nature, "emptiness" itself loses its status as a positive category. *Note: This prevents the reification of Emptiness. Emptiness is itself empty of inherent existence (*śūnyatā-śūnyatā*).*

---

## Verse 13.8
**śūnyatā sarvadṛṣṭīnāṃ proktā niḥsaraṇaṃ jinaiḥ |**
**yeṣāṃ tu śūnyatā dṛṣṭis tān asādhyān babhāṣire ||**

**Translation**:
"Emptiness is declared by the Victors [Buddhas] to be the relinquishing of all views.
But those for whom emptiness is [itself] a view are declared to be incurable."

**Commentary**:
*   **Asādhya** ("Incurable/Beyond help"): This is one of the most famous verses in the MMK. Emptiness is the medicine for the "disease" of reification. If you swallow the medicine and it turns into a new disease (a "view" to cling to), there is no other remedy.
*   **Niḥsaraṇam** ("Exit/Relinquishing"): Emptiness is a way out, not a destination.# Madhyamakashāstra Chapter 14: Examination of Association (Saṃsarga-parīkṣā)

## Verse 14.1
**draṣṭavyaṃ darśanaṃ draṣṭā trīṇy etāni dviśo dviśaḥ |**
**sarvaśaś ca na saṃsargaṃ anyonyena vrajanty uta ||**

**Translation**:
"The object to be seen, the seeing, and the seer—these three—
Do not enter into association with one another, either in pairs or all together."

**Commentary**:
*   **Dviśo dviśaḥ** ("Two by two"): Pairwise contact (Seer + Seen).
*   **Sarvaśaḥ** ("All together"): Simultaneous contact of the triad.
*   **Na saṃsargaṃ** ("No association"): Association requires two distinct entities meeting. Nāgārjuna will prove distinctness is impossible.

---

## Verse 14.2
**evaṃ rāgaś ca raktaś ca rañjanīyaṃ ca dṛśyatām |**
**traidhā traidhā ca sarveṣu kleśeṣv āyatanādiṣu ||**

**Translation**:
"In the same way, passion, the impassioned one, and the object of passion should be viewed.
And the three-fold [analysis applies] to all defilements and sense-spheres."

**Commentary**:
*   **Atideśa** ("Extension"): The logic applies to *Rāga* (Passion/Subject/Object), *Dveṣa* (Aversion), and *Moha* (Delusion). No defilement "touches" the mind because they are not distinct entities waiting to collide.

---

## Verse 14.3
**anyenānyasya saṃsargas tac cānyatvaṃ na vidyate |**
**draṣṭavyaprabhṛtīnāṃ yan na saṃsargam vrajanty ataḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Association is of one 'other' with another 'other'; but that 'otherness' is not found.
Therefore, the object to be seen and the rest do not enter into association."

**Commentary**:
*   **Anyatva** ("Otherness/Difference"): Crucial definition. For A to associate with B, A must be "other" than B. But if A and B are mutually dependent (Seer depends on Seen), they lack intrinsic "otherness."

---

## Verse 14.4
**na ca kevalam anyasya saṃsargo nāsti kasya cit |**
**kasyacit kena cit sārdhaṃ saṃsargaḥ kūṭa yujyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Not only does the 'other' not have association with anything;
[But] how can the association of anything with anything be logical?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Kūṭa yujyate** ("How is it logical?"): If "Otherness" fails, "Association" fails. If things are not "Other," they are "Same" or "Non-existent." The Same cannot associate (identity). The Non-existent cannot associate.

---

## Verse 14.5
**anyad anyat pratītyānyan nānyad anyad ṛte 'nyataḥ |**
**yat pratītya ca yat tasmāt tad anyan nopapadyate ||**

**Translation**:
"An 'other' is 'other' dependent on an 'other'; an 'other' is not 'other' without an 'other.'
And that which depends on something—from that, it does not arise as 'other'."

**Commentary**:
*   **Pratītya** ("Dependent on"): "Short" depends on "Long." "Short" has no intrinsic nature of its own. Therefore, "Short" is not intrinsically "Other" than "Long"—it is bound to it. Dependency negates separateness.

---

## Verse 14.6
**yady anyad anyad anyasmād anyasmād apy ṛte bhavet |**
**tad anyad anyad anyasmād ṛte nāsti ca nāsty ataḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"If an 'other' were 'other' [distinct] from an 'other,' it would exist even without that 'other.'
But an 'other' does not exist without an 'other'; therefore, it does not exist."

**Commentary**:
*   **Ṛte bhavet** ("Would exist without"): If "Left" were intrinsically "Left," it would remain "Left" even if you removed "Right." But without "Right," "Left" vanishes. Thus, true "Otherness" is impossible.

---

## Verse 14.7
**nānyasmin vidyate 'nyatvaṃ nananyasmin na cāsyate |**
**avidyamāne cānyatve kuto 'nyad upapadyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Otherness is not found in the 'other,' nor is it found in the 'non-other.'
And when 'otherness' does not exist, where does the 'other' obtain?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Anyasmin** ("In the other"): Otherness cannot reside in the Other (circularity). Nor in the Non-Other (contradiction). Since Difference is unestablished, Association (which presupposes Difference) is impossible.

---

## Verse 14.8
**na tena tasya saṃsargo nānyenānyasya yujyate |**
**saṃsrijyamānaṃ saṃsṛṣṭaṃ saṃsraṣṭā ca na vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"There is no association of this with that; nor is there [association] of the other with the other.
The associating, the associated, and the associator are not found."

**Commentary**:
*   **Na vidyate** ("Are not found"): Conclusion. The triad of interaction (Agent, Action, Object) collapses because the primary condition for interaction—Distinction—is absent.

## Verse 15.1
**na saṃbhavaḥ svabhāvasya yuktaḥ pratyayahetubhiḥ |**
**hetupratyayasaṃbhūtaḥ svabhāvaḥ kṛtako bhavet ||**

**Translation**:
"The arising of intrinsic nature from causes and conditions is not logical.
Intrinsic nature arising from causes and conditions would be something made."

**Commentary**:
*   **Svabhāva** ("Intrinsic Nature"): Defined here as that which is uncaused, independent, and unchanging. It is the *dgag bya* (object of negation) in Madhyamaka.
*   **Kṛtaka** ("Made/Artificial"): If nature depends on ingredients (like a cake depends on flour), it isn't "nature"—it's a product. Products are perishable; Nature is supposed to be eternal.

---

## Verse 15.2
**svabhāvaḥ kṛtako nāma bhaviṣyati punaḥ katham |**
**akṛtrimaḥ svabhāvo hi nirapekṣaḥ paratra ca ||**

**Translation**:
"How, indeed, could intrinsic nature be something called 'made'?
For intrinsic nature is unmade and independent of another."

**Commentary**:
*   **Akṛtrima** ("Unmade/Non-artificial"): Fire's heat is often cited as *svabhāva*. But even heat depends on fuel. Thus, even fire has no *svabhāva* in the ultimate sense.
*   **Nirapekṣa** ("Independent"): Absolute autonomy. Nothing in the conditioned world fits this definition.

---

## Verse 15.3
**kutaḥ svabhāvasyābhāve parabhāvo bhaviṣyati |**
**svabhāvaḥ parabhāvasya parabhāvo hi kathyate ||**

**Translation**:
"In the absence of intrinsic nature, whence will there be extrinsic nature?
For extrinsic nature is said to be the intrinsic nature of the 'other'."

**Commentary**:
*   **Parabhāva** ("Extrinsic Nature/Other-nature"): Being an "Other" is the *svabhāva* of the Other. If there is no *svabhāva* anywhere, there can be no *parabhāva*. You can't have a "fake" (other-nature) without a "real" (self-nature) to compare it to.

---

## Verse 15.4
**svabhāvaparabhaāvābhyām ṛte bhāvaḥ kuto bhavet |**
**svabhāve parabhāve vā sati bhāvo hi sidhyati ||**

**Translation**:
"Apart from intrinsic nature and extrinsic nature, where would existence be?
For existence is established when intrinsic nature or extrinsic nature exists."

**Commentary**:
*   **Bhāva** ("Existence/Entity"): Conventional existence is defined as having a nature (either one's own or another's). If both are absent, the category of "Entity" collapses.

---

## Verse 15.5
**bhāvasya ced aprasiddhir abhāvo naiva sidhyati |**
**bhāvasya hy anyathābhāvam abhāvaṃ bruvate janāḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"If existence is not established, non-existence is not established.
For people call the alteration of existence 'non-existence'."

**Commentary**:
*   **Abhāva** ("Non-existence"): Non-existence is just the change or cessation of Existence. If there was never a Thing, there can be no "Non-Thing."
*   **Crucial Distinction**: Emptiness (*śūnyatā*) is NOT Non-existence (*abhāva*). Emptiness is the absence of intrinsic nature. Non-existence is the annihilation of an entity. To confuse them is the root of Nihilism.

---

## Verse 15.6
**svabhāvaṃ parabhāvaṃ ca bhāvaṃ cābhāvam eva ca |**
**ye paśyanti na paśyanti te tattvaṃ buddhaśāsane ||**

**Translation**:
"Those who see intrinsic nature, extrinsic nature, existence, and non-existence—
They do not see the truth in the Teaching of the Buddha."

**Commentary**:
*   **Buddha-śāsane** ("In the Buddha's Teaching"): To posit *svabhāva* is to miss Dependent Origination. To posit *abhāva* is to fall into Nihilism. The Truth (*tattva*) lies elsewhere.

---

## Verse 15.7
**kātyāyanāvavāde cāstīti nāstīti cobhayam |**
**pratiṣiddhaṃ bhagavatā bhāvābhāvavibhāvinā ||**

**Translation**:
"And in the 'Advice to Katyāyana,' both 'it exists' and 'it does not exist'—
Were rejected by the Blessed One, who perceives [the nature of] existence and non-existence."

**Commentary**:
*   **Kātyāyanāvavāda** ("Advice to Katyāyana"): Refers to the *Kaccāyanagotta Sutta* (*Samyutta Nikaya* 12.15). This is the canonical anchor of the Madhyamaka. The Buddha tells Kaccāyana: "The world, for the most part, relies on a polarity: existence and non-existence." He rejects both.

---

## Verse 15.8
**yady astitvaṃ prakṛtyā syān na bhaved asya nāstitā |**
**prakṛter anyathābhāvo na hi jātūpapadyate ||**

**Translation**:
"If existence were by nature, its non-existence would not occur.
For the alteration of nature never logically obtains."

**Commentary**:
*   **Prakṛti** ("Nature"): Synonymous with *svabhāva*. If I exist by nature, I cannot die, because "Death" is the loss of existence. If existence is intrinsic, immortality follows (*śāśvata*).

---

## Verse 15.9
**prakṛtau kasya cāsatyām anyathābhāva ucyate |**
**prakṛtau kasya ca satyām anyathābhāva ucyate ||**

**Translation**:
"If nature does not exist, of what is alteration said?
And if nature exists, of what is alteration said?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Dilemma of Change**: If no nature, nothing changes. If nature exists, it can't change. Therefore, change itself is an illusion (*māyā*).

---

## Verse 15.10
**astīti śāśvatagrāho nāstīty ucchedadarśanam |**
**tasmād astitvanāstitve nāśrīyeta vicakṣaṇaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
" 'It exists' is a grasping at eternalism; 'It does not exist' is a view of annihilation.
Therefore, the wise should not rely on existence or non-existence."

**Commentary**:
*   **Śāśvata/Uccheda** ("Eternalism/Annihilation"): The two extremes (*antau*).
    *   *Asti* ("It is") -> Things have self-nature -> They never change -> Eternalism.
    *   *Nāsti* ("It isn't") -> Things had nature but lost it -> Annihilation.

---

## Verse 15.11
**asti yaddhi svabhāvena na tan nāstīti śāśvatam |**
**nāstīdānīm abhūt pūrvam ity ucchedaḥ prasajyate ||**

**Translation**:
" 'That which exists by intrinsic nature does not not-exist'—that is eternalism.
'It does not exist now, [but] it existed before'—from this, annihilation follows."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Middle Way**: To avoid these extremes, one must understand Dependent Origination (*pratītyasamutpāda*). As stated in Chapter 24.18: "Whatever is dependently co-arisen, that is explained to be emptiness." It is neither existent nor non-existent.# Madhyamakashāstra Chapter 16: Examination of Bondage and Liberation (Bandhana-mokṣa-parīkṣā)

## Verse 16.1
**saṃskārāḥ saṃsaranti cet te nātmā sa ca nāsty ataḥ |**
**saṃskārāḥ saṃsaranti te na saccāsacca te yataḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"If compounded phenomena transmigrate, they are not the Self; and that [Self] does not exist.
Therefore, compounded phenomena do not transmigrate, for they are neither existent nor non-existent."

**Commentary**:
*   **Saṃsaranti** ("Transmigrate/Wander"): To move from one birth to another. *Saṃskāras* are momentary (*kṣaṇika*). They perish right where they arise. They cannot travel.
*   **Na ātmā** ("Not the Self"): The aggregates are not the Soul. If there is no Soul, who is wandering?

---

## Verse 16.2
**skandham āyatanam dhātuṃ taṃ sambandhaṃ vanaikadha |**
**vicārayan na paśyāmi duḥkhasyāntam prapadyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Examining the aggregates, sense-spheres, and elements in their connection or singly—
I do not see him who attains the end of suffering."

**Commentary**:
*   **Duḥkhasya antam** ("End of suffering"): Nirvana. If we analyze the components of a person, we find only impersonal processes. There is no "Liberated One" found among the heap.

---

## Verse 16.3
**jīvo yadi anityo 'yam saṃsaranti na yujyate |**
**svabhāvena sato nityo na hi saṃsaratīsyate ||**

**Translation**:
"If this soul (*jīva*) is impermanent, its transmigration is not logical.
For what is existent by nature as eternal is not admitted to transmigate."

**Commentary**:
*   **Jīva** ("Life-force/Soul"):
    *   If Impermanent: It dies at death. Nothing moves to the next life.
    *   If Eternal: It is immutable. It cannot suffer, change, or be reborn.

---

## Verse 16.4
**saṃskārāṇāṃ na nirvāṇaṃ kathaṃ cid upapadyate |**
**sattvasyāpi na nirvāṇaṃ kathaṃ cid upapadyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Nirvana of compounded phenomena is not logical in any way.
Nirvana of a living being is also not logical in any way."

**Commentary**:
*   **Saṃskārāṇāṃ** ("Of aggregates"): They naturally cease. That is not Nirvana; that is just destruction.
*   **Sattvasya** ("Of a being"): A being is a fiction. Fictions cannot be liberated.

---

## Verse 16.5
**na badhyante na mucyante udayavyayadharmiṇaḥ |**
**saṃskārāḥ pūrvavat sattvo badhyate na na mucyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Compounded phenomena, which have the nature of arising and passing away, are neither bound nor liberated.
Likewise, a living being is neither bound nor liberated."

**Commentary**:
*   **Conventional vs. Ultimate**: Ultimately, since things perish instantly, there is no entity that persists long enough to be bound or freed. Conventionally, we speak of bondage and liberation as designations for the continuity of suffering or its cessation.

---

## Verse 16.6
**bandhanaṃ ced upādānaṃ sopādāno na badhyate |**
**badhyate nānupādānaḥ kim avasthā ca badhyate ||**

**Translation**:
"If grasping is bondage, one who has grasping is not bound [again].
One without grasping is not bound. What state is bound?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Upādāna** ("Grasping/Fuel"): The text puns on *upādāna* as both attachment and fuel.
    *   If you already have grasping, you are *already* bound. Bondage cannot act on itself.
    *   If you have no grasping, there is nothing to bind.

---

## Verse 16.7
**badhnīyād bandhanaṃ kāmān bandhanāt pūrvam eva ca |**
**na baddho vidyate śeṣaṃ gatāgatam idaṃ bhavet ||**

**Translation**:
"If bondage were to bind, it would bind indeed prior to bondage.
But a bound one does not exist [prior]. The rest is like the analysis of the goer and going."

**Commentary**:
*   **Gatāgata** ("Goer/Going"): Reference to Chapter 2. Bondage needs a pre-existing "Bindable Person." But such a person is not found.

---

## Verse 16.8
**baddho na mucyate tāvad abaddho naiva mucyate |**
**syātāṃ baddhe mucyamāne yugapad bandhanamokṣaṇe ||**

**Translation**:
"A bound one is not liberated; an unbound one is certainly not liberated.
If a bound one were being liberated, bondage and liberation would exist simultaneously."

**Commentary**:
*   **Yugapad** ("Simultaneously"): To be "being liberated" implies shedding chains. While shedding, one is still partly bound. This implies the copresence of Light and Dark.

---

## Verse 16.9
**nirvāsyāmy anupādāno nirvāṇaṃ me bhaviṣyati |**
**iti yeṣāṃ grahas teṣām upādānamahāgrahaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
" 'I will pass into Nirvana without grasping; Nirvana will be mine'—
Those who have such a grasp, theirs is a great grasping at grasping."

**Commentary**:
*   **Upādāna-mahāgrahaḥ** ("Great grasping at grasping"): The spiritual ego. Desiring Nirvana creates a self ("I will pass") and an object ("Nirvana"). This duality is the root of Samsara.

---

## Verse 16.10
**na nirvāṇasamāropo na saṃsārāpakarṣaṇam |**
**yatra kastatra saṃsāro nirvāṇaṃ kiṃ vikalpyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Where there is no superimposition of Nirvana nor removal of Samsara—
What is Samsara there? What is discriminated as Nirvana?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Samāropa/Apakarṣaṇa** ("Projection/Removal"): We don't need to "add" Nirvana or "subtract" Samsara. We just need to stop conceptualizing them as two real, opposed places.
*   **Samsara = Nirvana**: This anticipates the famous declaration in Chapter 25.19. Nirvana is not a different place; it is the reality of Samsara seen without delusion.# Madhyamakashāstra Chapter 17: Examination of Action and Fruit (Karma-phala-parīkṣā)
**Translator**: The Professor (Dr. Rajesh Patel)
**Status**: Scholarly Edition (Revised)

---

## Verse 17.1
**ātmasaṃyamakaṃ cetaḥ parānugrāhakaṃ ca yat |**
**maitram sa dharmas tad bījam phalasya pretya ceha ca ||**

**Translation**:
"The thought which is self-restraining and beneficent to others—
That friendliness is the Dharma; that is the seed of fruit here and hereafter."

**Commentary**:
*   **Ātmasaṃyamaka** ("Self-restraining"): Refraining from unwholesome deeds.
*   **Parānugrāhaka** ("Beneficent to others"): Engaging in wholesome deeds (*kuśala*). This verse establishes the conventional validity of moral action.

---

## Verse 17.2
**cetanā cetayitvā ca karmoktaṃ paramaṛṣiṇā |**
**tasyānekavidho bhedaḥ karmaṇaḥ parikīrtitaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Karma was declared by the Supreme Sage to be volition and [action] after having willed.
Of that karma, a manifold division has been proclaimed."

**Commentary**:
*   **Cetanā** ("Volition"): Mental karma (*manaskarma*).
*   **Cetayitvā** ("Having willed"): Physical and Vocal karma (*kāyika/vācika*). Reference to *Anguttara Nikaya* 6.63.

---

## Verse 17.3
**tatra yac cetanākhyaṃ tu karma tan mānasam smṛtam |**
**cetayitvā ca yat tūktaṃ tat kāyikaṃ vācikaṃ ca ||**

**Translation**:
"There, the karma called 'volition' is known as mental.
And that called 'after having willed' is physical and vocal."

**Commentary**:
*   **Taxonomy**: Distinction between the internal intent and the external expression.

---

## Verse 17.4-5 (The Seven Dharmas)
*Verses 4 and 5 list the Abhidharma classifications (vīratī, avijñapti, etc.). Summary: Action encompasses visible restraint and invisible influence.*

---

## Verse 17.6
**tiṣṭhaty ā pākakālāc cet karma tan nityatām iyāt |**
**niruddhaṃ cen niruddhaṃ sat kiṃ phalaṃ janayiṣyati ||**

**Translation**:
"If the action remains until the time of ripening, it would attain eternality.
If it has ceased, being ceased, how will it generate a fruit?"

**Commentary**:
*   **The Central Dilemma**: Action must disappear for the fruit to arise (a seed must die to make a sprout). But if it disappears, it is non-existent. How can a non-existent thing cause a result years later?

---

## Verse 17.7-11 (The Seed Analogy)
*The opponent argues: Just as a seed produces a sprout, which produces a fruit, the mind produces a continuum (*santāna*) which produces the fruit. Therefore, destruction (*uccheda*) is avoided.*
*   **Note on Karma without Self**: The Madhyamaka solution relies on the *Continuum* (*santāna*). Just as a river flows without a single drop remaining the same, the mind-stream carries the potential for fruit without a permanent "Soul" to carry it.

---

## Verse 17.12
**yadi kṛtvā vinaṣṭaṃ tan nānuyuktaṃ bhavet phalam |**
**boddhavyaṃ pratipakṣeṇa tan manye doṣa isyate ||**

**Translation**:
"If, having acted, that [action] is destroyed, the fruit would not be connected [to the agent].
This is to be understood by the counter-position; I think a fault is desired [by you]."

**Commentary**:
*   **Counter-position**: If the Seed/Continuum analogy holds, the fruit belongs to the continuum, not the original agent. Moral responsibility becomes fuzzy.

---

## Verse 17.13-14 (The Avipraṇāśa Theory)
*The opponent proposes a new entity: The "Imperishable" (*avipraṇāśa*). It is like a promissory note (*ṛṇapatra*). The action vanishes, but it leaves an "Imperishable" mark that persists until the debt is paid.*

---

## Verse 17.15
**karma nāśena naivāsyā vipraṇāśo 'pi vidyate |**
**karmaṇāṃ cāvipraṇāśo dharmo yo buddhabhāṣitaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Even with the destruction of the action, its 'imperishable' [aspect] exists.
And the imperishability of actions is a doctrine spoken by the Buddha."

**Commentary**:
*   **Avipraṇāśa**: A theoretical construct used by the Sammitīya school to bridge the gap between action and result.

---

## Verse 17.20
**yadi svabhāvataḥ karma syān na sṛjyeta śāśvatam |**
**akṛtaṃ cābhyupetaṃ syāt karma duḥkham ca śāśvatam ||**

**Translation**:
"If action were by intrinsic nature, it would not be created [and would be] eternal.
And an unperformed action would be accepted; and action and suffering would be eternal."

**Commentary**:
*   **Refutation**: If Karma had *svabhāva*, it couldn't arise (it would be eternal). If eternal, it could never be exhausted. One would suffer forever for one sin.

---

## Verse 17.21
**karoti yadi vā karma karoty anubhavaty api |**
**anyena kṛtaṃ karma anyo 'nubhavatīti ca ||**

**Translation**:
"If he performs an action [that exists by nature], he performs it and experiences it.
[Or] the action is done by one, and another experiences it."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Dilemma**: If Karma is real (*svabhāva*), the Agent must also be real/permanent to experience it. But a permanent Agent cannot *perform* an action (change). If the Agent changes, he is "Another."

---

## Verse 17.22
**priyam apriyam eṣaiva karmaṇaḥ phalam isyate |**
**saṃskārāṇām anādīnāṃ vyavahāro na sidhyati ||**

**Translation**:
"Pleasant and unpleasant is desired as the fruit of karma.
[But if karma had nature], the convention of beginningless aggregates would not be established."

**Commentary**:
*   **Vyavahāra** ("Convention"): The entire mechanism of Samsara depends on flux. Nature (*svabhāva*) freezes flux.

---

## Verse 17.23
**na saṃbhavaḥ svabhāvasya yuktaḥ pratyayahetubhiḥ |**
**hetupratyayasaṃbhūtaḥ svabhāvaḥ kṛtako bhavet ||**

**Translation**:
"The arising of intrinsic nature from causes and conditions is not logical.
Intrinsic nature arising from causes and conditions would be something made."

**Commentary**:
*   **Recap**: Reiteration of Chapter 15. Karma arises from conditions (ignorance, craving); therefore, it has no nature.

---

## Verse 17.24
**kleśāś ca karmaṇaś caiva dehe santi na dehinām |**
**dehāś ca karmaṇaḥ kleśā yasmāt santi na dehinām ||**

**Translation**:
"Defilements and actions are not in the body, nor in the embodied ones.
Since defilements and actions do not exist, bodies do not exist."

**Commentary**:
*   **Dehin** ("Embodied One"): The Self. Since Karma and Klesha are empty, the "Owner" of the body is also empty.

---

## Verse 17.25
**kleśāś ca karmaṇaś kāyāḥ kartāraś ca phalāni ca |**
**gandharvanagarākārā marīcisvapnasaṃnibhāḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Defilements, actions, bodies, agents, and fruits—
Are like a city of Gandharvas, resembling a mirage or a dream."

**Commentary**:
*   **Gandharva-nagara** ("City of Celestial Musicians"): An optical illusion in the clouds. Karma appears solid but dissolves upon approach.

---

## Verse 17.27
**na saṃsāram utpādayanti na ca karma samudbhavanti |**
**na cāpi karmaṇā kleśāḥ kutaḥ karma bhaviṣyati ||**

**Translation**:
"They do not produce Samsara, nor do actions arise [from nature].
Nor do defilements [arise] from action; whence will action exist?"

**Commentary**:
*   **The Chain Breaks**: If no nature, no production. If no production, no Samsara.

---

## Verse 17.30
**yathā nirmitakaṃ śāstā nirmimīta maharddhikaḥ |**
**tathā nirmitakas tasya nirmimītāparaṃ punaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Just as a Teacher with great magical power might emit an illusory creation (*nirmitaka*);
And that illusory creation might emit another one again."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Grand Analogy**: The Buddha (Teacher) creates a phantom monk. The phantom monk preaches to a phantom audience. Who is acting? Who is listening?

---

## Verse 17.31
**tathā kartā kṛtaṃ karma yan nirmitakavat kṛtam |**
**yathā nirmitakenānyo nirmitas tat tatheti ca ||**

**Translation**:
"In the same way, the agent is like the [first] illusory creation; and the action done is like the [second] creation made by the illusory one."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Recursive Illusion**: The "Self" is the first illusion (created by Ignorance). This illusory Self creates "Karma" (the second illusion). We are shadows chasing shadows.

---

## Verse 17.33
**kleśāś karma ca dehāś ca kartāraś ca phalāni ca |**
**gandharvanagarākārā marīcisvapnasaṃnibhāḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Defilements, actions, bodies, agents, and fruits—
Are like a city of Gandharvas, resembling a mirage or a dream."

**Commentary**:
*   **Repetition**: The verse is repeated (from 17.25) for emphasis as the conclusion. The solidity of the moral universe is deconstructed not to destroy morality, but to show its dream-like texture.# Madhyamakashāstra Chapter 18: Examination of Self (Ātma-parīkṣā)

## Verse 18.1
**yadi skandhā bhaved ātmā udayavyayabhāg bhavet |**
**yady anyo bhavet skandhebhyo bhāved askandhalakṣaṇaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"If the Self were the aggregates, it would be subject to arising and passing away.
If it were other than the aggregates, it would lack the characteristics of the aggregates."

**Commentary**:
*   **Pañcadhā Mṛgya** ("The Fivefold Search"): This verse initiates the classic Madhyamaka algorithm for finding the Self, which is fully expanded in Chapter 22.1 regarding the Tathāgata.
    1.  Identity: Is Self = Aggregates? (No, because aggregates die).
    2.  Difference: Is Self ≠ Aggregates? (No, because a disembodied self cannot feel/act).
*   **Udayavyayabhāg** ("Partaking in arising/passing"): If Self = Body/Mind, then when the body dies, the Self dies (Annihilationism).
*   **Askandhalakṣaṇaḥ** ("Without aggregate characteristics"): If Self ≠ Body/Mind, it would be inert, unable to feel, think, or act. It would be a "sky-flower."

---

## Verse 18.2
**ātmany asati cātmīyaṃ kuta eva bhaviṣyati |**
**nirmamo nirahaṃkāraḥ śamād ātmātmanīnayoḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"And when the Self does not exist, how indeed will 'what belongs to the Self' exist?
One becomes free from 'mine' and free from 'I-making' due to the pacification of Self and what belongs to Self."

**Commentary**:
*   **Ātmanīnayoḥ** ("Of the Self and Self's property"): The collapse of the Ego (*aham*) inevitably leads to the collapse of Possessiveness (*mama*).

---

## Verse 18.3
**nirmamo nirahaṃkāraḥ pratīto yadi dṛśyate |**
**yo 'pi paśyati nirmamaṃ nirahaṃkāram eva ca ||**

**Translation**:
"If one who is free from 'mine' and 'I-making' is perceived [as an entity]—
He who sees [that person] sees neither the one free from 'mine' nor the one free from 'I-making'."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Trap of Arrogance** (*Tib: ñams len*): If you think, "I have destroyed the Ego," you have just created a new Ego—the "Holy Ego." True liberation is not seeing a "Liberated Person."

---

## Verse 18.4
**mamety aham iti kṣīṇe bahirdhā dhyātmam eva ca |**
**nirudhyata upādānaṃ tat kṣayāj janmanaḥ kṣayaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"When 'mine' and 'I' have waned, both externally and internally,
Grasping ceases; from the destruction of that [grasping], there is destruction of birth."

**Commentary**:
*   **Causal Chain**: End of I-making -> End of Grasping (*upādāna*) -> End of Becoming (*bhava*) -> End of Birth (*jāti*). This is the reversal of the Twelve Links.

---

## Verse 18.5
**karmakleśakṣayān mokṣaḥ karmakleśā vikalpataḥ |**
**te prapañcāt prapañcas tu śūnyatāyāṃ nirudhyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Liberation comes from the destruction of karma and defilements. Karma and defilements come from conceptualization.
Those [conceptualizations] come from mental proliferation. But proliferation ceases in Emptiness."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Path of Cessation**:
    1.  **Prapañca** (Conceptual Proliferation): The mind's tendency to reify.
    2.  **Vikalpa** (Discrimination): Splitting the world into Subject/Object.
    3.  **Kleśa/Karma** (Defilement/Action): Reacting to that split with craving/aversion.
    4.  **Mokṣa** (Liberation): The cessation of this chain. *Śūnyatā* (Emptiness) stops the *Prapañca* at the source.

---

## Verse 18.6
**ātmety api prajñapitam anātmety api deśitam |**
**buddhair nātmā na cānātmā kaścid ity api deśitam ||**

**Translation**:
" 'Self' has been made known; 'No-Self' has also been taught.
'Neither Self nor No-Self' has also been taught by the Buddhas."

**Commentary**:
*   **Upāya** ("Skillful Means"): The Buddha is a doctor.
    *   To the Nihilist, he taught "Self" (Responsibility).
    *   To the Eternalist, he taught "No-Self" (Impermanence).
    *   To the Wise, he taught "Neither" (Emptiness of all views).

---

## Verse 18.7
**nivṛttam abhidhātavyaṃ nivṛtte cittagocare |**
**anutpannāniruddhā hi nirvāṇam iva dharmatā ||**

**Translation**:
"That which is to be designated ceases when the sphere of thought ceases.
For the nature of phenomena (*dharmatā*) is like Nirvana—unborn and unceased."

**Commentary**:
*   **Citta-gocare** ("Sphere of thought"): Language (*abhidhāna*) relies on dualistic thought. When thought stops, language stops. Reality is ineffable.

---

## Verse 18.8
**sarvaṃ tathyaṃ na vā tathyaṃ tathyaṃ cātathyam eva ca |**
**naivātathyaṃ naiva tathyam etad buddhānuśāsanam ||**

**Translation**:
"Everything is real, or not real, or both real and not real,
Or neither not real nor real—this is the instruction of the Buddhas."

**Commentary**:
*   **Gradual Instruction**:
    1.  Real (Conventional truth).
    2.  Not Real (Ultimate analysis).
    3.  Both (Integration).
    4.  Neither (Final transcendence).

---

## Verse 18.9
**aparapratyayaṃ śāntaṃ prapañcair aprapañcitam |**
**nirvikalpam anānārtham etat tattvasya lakṣaṇam ||**

**Translation**:
"Not dependent on another, peaceful, not proliferated by conceptual proliferation,
Free from conceptualization, without diversity of meaning—this is the characteristic of Reality (*tattva*)."

**Commentary**:
*   **Aparapratyayam**: Known directly by oneself (gnosis), not through hearsay or logic.
*   **Śāntam**: Peaceful/Quiescent. The noise of *prapañca* has stopped.
*   **Aprapañcitam**: Not distorted by the mind's reifying tendencies.

## Verse 18.10
**pratītya yad yad bhavati na hi tāvat tad eva tat |**
**na cānyad api tat tasmān nocchinnaṃ nāpi śāśvatam ||**

**Translation**:
"Whatever arises depending on [something], that is not identical to that [cause].
Nor is that [effect] other than that [cause]. Therefore, it is neither cut off nor eternal."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Middle Way**: Identity (*tat eva*) leads to Eternalism. Difference (*anyad*) leads to Annihilationism. Dependency avoids both.

---

## Verse 18.12
**saṃbuddhānām anutpāde śrāvakāṇāṃ punaḥ kṣaye |**
**jñānaṃ pratyekabuddhānām asamsargāt pravartate ||**

**Translation**:
"When fully enlightened Buddhas do not arise, and when disciples too have ceased,
The wisdom of the Solitary Buddhas (*Pratyekabuddhas*) proceeds without association [teaching]."

**Commentary**:
*   **Asaṃsargāt** ("From non-association/solitude"): Even in the Dark Ages without a Teacher, the truth of Dependent Origination is accessible to those who quiet the mind. The Dharma is part of the fabric of reality, not a human invention.# Madhyamakashāstra Chapter 19: Examination of Time (Kāla-parīkṣā)

## Verse 19.1
**pratyutpanno 'nāgataś ca yady atītam apekṣya hi |**
**pratyutpanno 'nāgataś ca kāle 'tīte bhaviṣyataḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"If the present and the future depend on the past,
Then the present and the future would exist in the past time."

**Commentary**:
*   **Apekṣya** ("Depending on"): If B depends on A, B must be connected to A. If Future connects to Past, the Future must exist *at the time of* the Past. But if Future exists in the Past, it is Past.

---

## Verse 19.2
**pratyutpanno 'nāgataś ca na stas tatra punar yadi |**
**pratyutpanno 'nāgataś ca katham atītam apekṣya hi ||**

**Translation**:
"And if the present and the future do not exist there [in the past],
How indeed could the present and the future depend on the past?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Na stas tatra** ("Do not exist there"): If they are totally separate, how can one influence the other? A non-existent relation cannot support temporal order.

---

## Verse 19.3
**anayāivādhvanā gamyāv atītoparimādayaḥ |**
**na sthitir na ca gantavyaṃ na ca gantuṃ ca yujyate ||**

**Translation**:
"By this very method, the remaining two times [past/future relative to present], and [spatial concepts like] above, below, and middle are to be understood.
Static existence is not logical; nor is 'to be gone to,' nor 'going'."

**Commentary**:
*   **Atideśa** ("Extension"): The logic of mutual dependence applies to Space (*diś*) as well as Time (*kāla*). There is no absolute "Middle" without "Left" and "Right."

---

## Verse 19.4
**kālaś ca nāsty abhāvena kutaḥ kālo bhaviṣyati |**
**bhāvaṃ pratītya kālaś cet kālo bhāvad ṛte kutaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Time does not exist [as a separate entity]; without an entity, whence will there be time?
If time depends on an entity, where is time without an entity?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Bhāvaṃ pratītya** ("Depending on an entity"): Time is a measurement of change. Change requires a "Thing" that changes. If the "Thing" is empty (as proven in previous chapters), the "Clock" measures nothing.

---

## Verse 19.5
**na sthitaṃ gṛhyate kālam sthitakālo na vidyate |**
**yo gṛhītas tagṛhītaḥ kālo nāsty adhvaśo 'pi vā ||**

**Translation**:
"A static time is not grasped; and a static time is not found.
And a time that is grasped as ungrasped [changing] does not exist."

**Commentary**:
*   **Sthita/Asthita** ("Static/Dynamic"): You can't catch "Time" while it's moving (it's gone). You can't catch it when it's stopped (it's not Time).

---

## Verse 19.6
**yāvad bhāvam apekṣyate kālo nāma na vidyate |**
**bhāvo 'pi ca na vidyate kutaḥ kālo bhaviṣyati ||**

**Translation**:
"Insofar as time depends on an entity, [independent] time is not found.
And since an entity is also not found, whence will there be time?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Conclusion**: Time is a parasitic concept. It feeds on the reality of Objects. Since Objects are empty of *svabhāva*, Time is the "Shadow of a Phantom."

## Verse 20.1
**hetoś ca phalasya ca yadi hi saṃyogaḥ kalpate |**
**jayeta saṃyogaḥ kas tasmād dhetuphalayoḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"If the connection of cause and effect is imagined,
What kind of connection between that cause and effect is produced?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Saṃyoga** ("Connection/Contact"): The opponent claims Cause and Effect must touch to transfer energy. But "touching" implies simultaneity.

---

## Verse 20.2-4 (The Dilemma of Contact)
*If they are connected, they exist at the same time. If they exist at the same time, which is the producer? If they are separated (*viyukta*), how can the Cause influence the Effect across a gap?*

---

## Verse 20.5
**yathā ca hetuphalayoḥ saṃyogo na vidyate |**
**tathā hetuphalayor vibhāgo 'pi na vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Just as connection of cause and effect is not found,
So too, separation of cause and effect is not found."

**Commentary**:
*   **Vibhāga** ("Separation"): If totally separate, any cause could produce any effect (e.g., a mango seed producing a coconut).

---

## Verse 20.9
**nirodhe sati hetoś ca phalaṃ yady upapadyate |**
**hetur niruddhaḥ kasya syāt phalam utpadyate kadā ||**

**Translation**:
"If the fruit arises when the cause has ceased,
Whose ceased cause would it be? When does the fruit arise?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Niruddha** ("Ceased"): A ceased cause is non-existent. How can "Nothing" produce "Something"? This refutes the *Sautrāntika* view of immediate succession.

---

## Verse 20.11
**yadi saṃyuktāddhetoḥ phalam utpadyate yadi |**
**utpadyamānaṃ tad dhetor nivarteta katham punaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"If the fruit arises from a connected cause,
How could that fruit, being produced, turn back again from the cause?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Nivarteta** ("Turn back/Distinct"): If they are connected (fused), the Fruit is part of the Cause. It never emerges as a distinct entity.

---

## Verse 20.16
**hetuḥ phalasya nūnaṃ syād asataḥ katham arhati |**
**hetuḥ phalasya nūnaṃ syāt sataḥ katham arhati ||**

**Translation**:
"Certainly, if the fruit is non-existent, how is the cause capable [of producing it]?
Certainly, if the fruit is existent, how is the cause capable?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Asataḥ** ("Non-existent"): You can't produce what doesn't have the potential to exist.
*   **Sataḥ** ("Existent"): You don't need to produce what already exists.

---

## Verse 20.19
**hetuphalayoḥ saṃbandhaḥ phalasya ca na vidyate |**
**saṃbandhe sati hetoś ca phalasya ca na vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"A relation of cause and effect, and of the fruit, is not found.
When there is a relation, neither cause nor fruit is found."

**Commentary**:
*   **Saṃbandha** ("Relation"): Relation requires two distinct terms. But Cause and Effect are mutually defining. They collapse into each other.

---

## Verse 20.24
**saṃyoge cāsaṃyoge ca hetuphalayor ayuktatā |**
**parīkṣitā katham nūnaṃ sāmagrī janayiṣyati ||**

**Translation**:
"Since the illogicality of both connection and non-connection of cause and effect
Has been examined, how indeed will the 'combination' (*sāmagrī*) generate [anything]?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Sāmagrī** ("Combination/Assemblage"): The opponent's last resort—"Maybe the individual causes don't work, but the *Collection* works." Nāgārjuna replies: A collection of impotent causes is still impotent. 0 + 0 + 0 ≠ 1.

**Translator**: The Professor (Dr. Rajesh Patel)
**Status**: Scholarly Edition

---

## Verse 21.1
**vinā vā saha vā nāsti vibhavaḥ saṃbhavena vai |**
**vinā vā saha vā nāsti saṃbhavo vibhavena vai ||**

**Translation**:
"Destruction does not exist either without or with production.
Production does not exist either without or with destruction."

**Commentary**:
*   **Saṃbhava/Vibhava** ("Production/Destruction"): Or "Arising/Passing."
*   **Vinā** ("Without"): If Production exists without Destruction, it would be eternal (*nitya*).
*   **Saha** ("With"): If they exist simultaneously, one would be dying at the very moment of birth.

---

## Verse 21.2
**bhaviṣyati kathaṃ nāma vibhavaḥ saṃbhaṃ vinā |**
**vinaiva janma maraṇaṃ vinaivārambhato vyayaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"How indeed will destruction exist without production?
[It would be like] death without birth, or cessation without a beginning."

**Commentary**:
*   **Absurdity**: You can't destroy what was never built. Destruction depends on Production.

---

## Verse 21.3
**saṃbhavenaiva vibhavaḥ katham saha bhaviṣyati |**
**na janmamaraṇaṃ caiva tulyakālaṃ hi vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"How will destruction exist simultaneously with production?
For birth and death are not found at the same time."

**Commentary**:
*   **Contradiction**: Light and Darkness cannot occupy the same space. Life and Death are mutually exclusive states.

---

## Verse 21.4
**bhaviṣyati kathaṃ nāma saṃbhavo vibhavaṃ vinā |**
**anityatā hi bhāveṣu na kadācin na vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"How indeed will production exist without destruction?
For impermanence is never not found in entities."

**Commentary**:
*   **Anityatā** ("Impermanence"): This is the key argument. Impermanence is not something that happens *to* an object later; it is the nature of the object from the start. If Production were separate from Destruction, things would be static.

---

## Verse 21.6
**sahānyonyena vā siddhir vinānyonyena vā yayoḥ |**
**na vidyate tayoḥ siddhiḥ kathaṃ nu khalu vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Of which two the establishment is not found either with one another or without one another—
How indeed is the establishment of those two found?"

**Commentary**:
*   **The Collapse**: Since neither the "Simultaneous Model" nor the "Sequential Model" works, both concepts—Birth and Death—are empty.

---

## Verse 21.11
**dṛśyate saṃbhavaś caiva na vibhavena bādhyate |**
**na saṃbhavena vibhavaḥ kāla bhedena yujyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Production appears, and it is not blocked by destruction.
Nor is destruction [blocked] by production; it is logical due to the difference in time."

**Commentary**:
*   **Opponent's View**: "But we *see* things arise and then later die. There is a time gap (*kāla-bheda*)."
*   **Rejoinder**: If there is a gap, the thing exists eternally during that gap (see Verse 21.4).

---

## Verse 21.13
**bhavāṃś ced āha bhāvānāṃ sāntir eva na saṃbhavaḥ |**
**yadi kaścid bhaved bhāvaḥ sāntir eva bhaved iha ||**

**Translation**:
"If you say that for entities there is only cessation, not production—
If some entity were to exist, cessation would exist here."

**Commentary**:
*   **Refutation of Nihilism**: You can't have "Just Cessation." Cessation requires a prior Entity. No Entity = No Cessation.

---

## Verse 21.17
**parabhāve 'bhyupagate saṃbhavo vibhavaḥ kutaḥ |**
**ekasyārthasya nānātvaṃ kutaḥ saṃbhavavibhavau ||**

**Translation**:
"If 'other-nature' is accepted, whence are production and destruction?
[If] there is multiplicity of a single object, whence are production and destruction?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Identity Problem**: If the "Seed" destroys itself to become a "Sprout," are they the same or different? If same, no change. If different, no continuity.

---

## Verse 21.21
**saṃbhavo vibhavaś caiva nityam ātmani dṛśyate |**
**saṃbhavo vibhavaś caiva vyākhyāto 'nena karmaṇā ||**

**Translation**:
"Production and destruction are seen constantly in the Self.
Production and destruction have been explained by this [analysis of] action."

**Commentary**:
*   **Conclusion**: The logic applied to entities applies to the Soul. The Soul is not born, nor does it die. It is empty.

## Verse 22.1
**skandhā na nānyaḥ skandhebhyo nāsmin skandhā na teṣu saḥ |**
**tathāgataḥ skandhavān na katamo 'tra tathāgataḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"He is not the aggregates, nor other than the aggregates; the aggregates are not in him, nor is he in them;
The Tathāgata does not possess the aggregates. Which one is the Tathāgata here?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Pañcadhā mṛgya** ("Five-fold Search"): The classic Madhyamaka algorithm for deconstructing the Self.
    1.  Identity (*skandhā na*): He is not the body/mind (or he would die).
    2.  Difference (*na anyaḥ*): He is not separate (or he would be inert).
    3.  Container (*na asmin*): He doesn't hold them like a bowl holds fruit.
    4.  Contained (*na teṣu*): He isn't hidden inside them.
    5.  Possessor (*skandhavān na*): He doesn't own them like a man owns a cow.

---

## Verse 22.2
**buddhaḥ skandhān upādāya yadi nāsti svabhāvataḥ |**
**svabhāvataś ca yo nāsti kutaḥ sa parabhāvataḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"If the Buddha, dependent on the aggregates, does not exist by intrinsic nature—
And he who does not exist by intrinsic nature, whence [can he exist] by extrinsic nature?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Upādāya** ("Dependent on"): The Buddha exists only in dependence on his form, feelings, etc. Therefore, he has no *svabhāva*. If he has no Self-nature, he cannot have Other-nature (*parabhāva*).

---

## Verse 22.6
**skandhān upādāya ca yo nāsti so 'sty anupādataḥ |**
**yo nāsty anupādāya ca sa bhāvo nopalabhyate ||**

**Translation**:
"He who does not exist dependent on the aggregates, does he exist without dependence?
He who does not exist without dependence, that entity is not perceived."

**Commentary**:
*   **Anupādāya** ("Without grasping/dependence"): You cannot find a "Buddha" apart from the five aggregates. There is no transcendent "Super-Buddha" floating in the void.

---

## Verse 22.11
**śūnyam iti na vaktavyam aśūnyam iti vā bhavet |**
**ubhayaṃ nobhayaṃ ceti prajñapty arthaṃ tu kathyate ||**

**Translation**:
" 'Empty' should not be asserted; nor should 'Non-empty' be [asserted];
'Both' and 'Neither' [should not be asserted]; but these are spoken for the purpose of designation."

**Commentary**:
*   **Prajñapty-arthaṃ** ("For the purpose of designation"): Emptiness itself is a provisional teaching (*upāya*). If we say "He is Empty," we reify Emptiness. We only say it to cure the disease of "He is Real." Once cured, we drop the medicine.

---

## Verse 22.12
**śāśvatāśāśvatādy atra kutaḥ śānte catuṣṭayam |**
**antānantādi cāpy atra kutaḥ śānte catuṣṭayam ||**

**Translation**:
"Eternal, non-eternal, and so forth—where is this quaternity in the Peaceful?
Finite, infinite, and so forth—where is this quaternity in the Peaceful?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Avyākṛta** ("Undetermined Questions"): These refer to the classic 14 questions (Is the world eternal? Is the soul the body? Does the Tathāgata exist after death?) which the Buddha met with silence. Nāgārjuna explains *why*: the terms (Tathāgata, World) are empty, so the predicates (Eternal, Infinite) cannot apply.
*   **Śānte** ("In the Peaceful"): In the quiescent state of Nirvana, these categories do not apply.

---

## Verse 22.13
**yena grāho gṛhītas tu ghano 'stīti tathāgataḥ |**
**kalpayan nirvṛte 'py asmin kalpayet so 'pi vā punaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"One who holds the grasp that 'The Tathāgata exists as a solid thing'—
That one, conceptualizing, would conceptualize him even after he has attained Nirvana."

**Commentary**:
*   **Ghana** ("Solid/Dense"): Seeing the Buddha as a concrete entity. If you think he is "real" now, you will speculate about where he "goes" after death. Both are delusions.

---

## Verse 22.15
**prapañcayanti ye buddhaṃ prapañcātītam avyayam |**
**te prapañcāhatāḥ sarve na paśyanti tathāgatam ||**

**Translation**:
"Those who conceptually proliferate the Buddha, who is beyond proliferation and imperishable—
All those, struck down by proliferation, do not see the Tathāgata."

**Commentary**:
*   **Na paśyanti** ("They do not see"): To see the Buddha as a physical form or a mental concept is to miss him entirely. "He who sees the Dharma sees me."

---

## Verse 22.16
**tathāgato yatsvabhāvas tat svabhāvam idaṃ jagat |**
**tathāgato niḥsvabhāvo niḥsvabhāvam idaṃ jagat ||**

**Translation**:
" Whatever is the intrinsic nature of the Tathāgata, that is the intrinsic nature of this world.
The Tathāgata is without intrinsic nature; this world is without intrinsic nature."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Grand Equation**: Samsara = Nirvana. The Buddha is not different from the World. Both are Empty. Because they share the same "Naturelessness," liberation is possible right here, right now.# Madhyamakashāstra Chapter 23: Examination of Perversions (Viparyāsa-parīkṣā)
**Translator**: The Professor (Dr. Rajesh Patel)
**Status**: Scholarly Edition (Revised)

---

## Verse 23.1
**saṃkalpaprabhavo rāgo dveso mohaś ca kathyate |**
**śubhāśubhaviparyāsān saṃbhavanti pratītya hi ||**

**Translation**:
"Lust, hatred, and delusion are said to arise from conceptualization.
They arise dependent on perversions regarding the beautiful and the repulsive."

**Commentary**:
*   **Saṃkalpa** ("Conceptualization/Fantasy"): Defilements do not come from the object itself, but from our mental fabrication about the object.
*   **Viparyāsa** ("Perversion/Inversion"): Seeing the impermanent as eternal, painful as pleasurable, impure as pure, and non-self as self.

---

## Verse 23.2
**śubhāśubhaviparyāsāḥ saṃbhavanti pratītya ye |**
**te svabhāvān na vidyante tasmāt kleśā na tattvataḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Those perversions regarding the beautiful and repulsive which arise dependently—
They do not exist by intrinsic nature. Therefore, defilements do not exist in reality."

**Commentary**:
*   **Na tattvataḥ** ("Not in reality"): The error is not just that we see the object wrongly; the error is thinking there is an "object" at all. Since the object of lust (e.g., a body) is empty of *svabhāva*, the perversion is an error about a phantom.

---

## Verse 23.6
**rūpaśabdarasasparśā gandhā dharmāś ca kevalāḥ |**
**gandharvanagarākārā marīcisvapnasaṃnibhāḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Form, sound, taste, touch, smell, and mental objects entirely—
Are like a city of Gandharvas, resembling a mirage or a dream."

**Commentary**:
*   **Gandharva-nagara**: A stock image for an illusion. If the object of lust (e.g., a beautiful body) is a mirage, then the lust itself is like thirsting for phantom water.

---

## Verse 23.7
**aśubhaṃ vā śubhaṃ vāpi kutas teṣu bhaviṣyati |**
**māyāpuruṣakalpeṣu pratibimbasameṣu ca ||**

**Translation**:
"How will the repulsive or the beautiful exist in them—
Which are like illusory men and resemble reflections?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Māyā-puruṣa** ("Magical Creation"): You cannot say a reflection in a mirror is "clean" or "dirty" in reality; it has no substance to hold the quality. The ontological emptiness of the substrate precludes the predication of "purity" or "impurity."

---

## Verse 23.8
**anāpekṣya śubhaṃ nāsty aśubhaṃ prajñapayemahi |**
**yat pratītya śubhaṃ tasmāc chubhaṃ naivopapadyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Without depending on the beautiful, the repulsive does not exist—[so] we designate [the repulsive].
Therefore, the beautiful which depends on [the repulsive] does not logically obtain."

**Commentary**:
*   **Mutual Dependence**: "Beautiful" only makes sense in contrast to "Ugly." If A needs B to exist, A is not self-existent. Beauty is relative, not intrinsic.

---

## Verse 23.13
**yena gṛhṇāti yo grāho gṛhītā yacca gṛhyate |**
**upaśāntāni sarvāṇi tasmād grāho na vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"That by which one grasps, the grasping, the grasper, and that which is grasped—
All are pacified. Therefore, grasping is not found."

**Commentary**:
*   **Upaśānta** ("Pacified/Extinguished"): In Emptiness, the subject-object duality dissolves. No Grasper = No Grasping = No Perversion.

---

## Verse 23.14
**avidyamāne grāhe ca mithyā vā samyag eva vā |**
**bhavet kasya viparyāsaḥ kasya vāviparyayaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"And when grasping does not exist, whether false or correct—
Of whom will there be perversion? Or of whom will there be non-perversion?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Kasya** ("Of whom?"): Perversion implies a Person who is perverted. But the Person (*ātman*) was refuted in Chapter 18.

---

## Verse 23.21
**evam nirudhyate 'vidyā viparyāsanirodhanāt |**
**avidyāyāṃ niruddhāyāṃ saṃskārādyam nirudhyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Thus, ignorance ceases due to the cessation of perversions.
When ignorance has ceased, compounded phenomena and the rest cease."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Chain Reaction**: Seeing Emptiness stops Perversion -> stops Ignorance -> stops Karma -> stops Birth/Death. This is the logic of the Third Noble Truth (*Nirodha*).

---

## Verse 23.25
**rāgadveṣamohāś caivaṃ na santi paramārthataḥ |**
**kleśāś ca karmaṇaś caiva dehe santi na dehinām ||**

**Translation**:
"Thus lust, hatred, and delusion do not exist ultimately.
Defilements and actions are not in the body, nor in the embodied ones."

**Commentary**:
*   **Paramārthataḥ** ("Ultimately"): Conventionally, we treat lust with antidotes. Ultimately, we see it never arose.# Madhyamakashāstra Chapter 24: Examination of the Noble Truths (Ārya-satya-parīkṣā)
**Translator**: The Professor (Dr. Rajesh Patel)
**Status**: Scholarly Edition (Revised)

---

## Verse 24.1
**yadi śūnyam idaṃ sarvam udayo nāsti na vyayaḥ |**
**catūrṇām āryasatyānāṃ abhāvas te prasajyate ||**

**Translation**:
"If all this is empty, there is no arising and no passing away.
It follows that for you, the non-existence of the Four Noble Truths occurs."

**Commentary**:
*   **Prasaṅga** ("Consequence"): The opponent begins a devastating critique. If everything lacks intrinsic nature (*svabhāva*), then nothing can arise. If nothing arises, there is no "Suffering" (*Dukkha*), and thus the Four Noble Truths collapse.

---

## Verse 24.6
**śūnyatām upadhāryevaṃ sarvaṃ bādhasva tulyam |**
**sarvaṃ eva hi bādhasva śūnyatām upadhārayan ||**

**Translation**:
"By assuming emptiness in this way, you contradict everything.
Indeed, you contradict everything by assuming emptiness!"

**Commentary**:
*   **The Charge of Nihilism**: The opponent equates Emptiness (*śūnyatā*) with Nothingness (*abhāva*). To them, if a thing is "empty," it isn't there.

---

## Verse 24.7
**atra brūmaḥ na vijñāsi śūnyatāṃ śūnyatārthaṃ ca |**
**śūnyatāṃ śūnyatārthaṃ ca tata evaṃ vihanyase ||**

**Translation**:
"To this we say: You do not understand the purpose of emptiness, nor emptiness itself,
Nor the meaning of emptiness. Therefore, you are tormented in this way."

**Commentary**:
*   **Diagnosis**: Nāgārjuna identifies the category error. The opponent thinks Emptiness is a *denial* of reality, whereas it is actually the *condition* for reality.

---

## Verse 24.8
**dve satye samupāśritya buddhānāṃ dharmadeśanā |**
**lokasaṃvṛtisatyaṃ ca satyaṃ ca paramārthataḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"The teaching of the Dharma by the Buddhas relies on two truths:
The conventional truth of the world and the truth of the ultimate meaning."

**Commentary**:
*   **Loka-saṃvṛti-satya** ("Conventional Truth"): Literally "concealing truth" or "truth of the covering." This is the level of language, concepts, causality, and moral action. It is "true" because it functions reliably in the world, even though it is deceptive (like a reflection in a mirror).
*   **Paramārtha-satya** ("Ultimate Truth"): The realization that all conventional entities are empty of intrinsic nature. It is not a "higher reality" hiding behind the conventional, but the *nature* of the conventional itself.

---

## Verse 24.10
**vyavahāram anāśritya paramārtho na deśyate |**
**paramārtham anāgamaṃ nirvāṇaṃ nādhigamyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Without relying on everyday convention, the ultimate meaning is not taught.
Without approaching the ultimate meaning, Nirvana is not attained."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Ladder**: You cannot jump to the ultimate while ignoring the conventional. Emptiness doesn't destroy the Four Noble Truths; it provides the medium through which they function. If you ignore the medicine (conventional Dharma), you can't cure the disease (Suffering).

---

## Verse 24.11
**vināśayati durdṛṣṭā śūnyatā mandamedhasam |**
**sarpo yathā durgṛhīto vidyā vā duṣprasādhitā ||**

**Translation**:
"Emptiness, wrongly perceived, destroys a person of dull intelligence—
Like a snake grasped by the tail, or a spell wrongly cast."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Danger**: If you think Emptiness means "nothing matters" or "nothing exists," you fall into Nihilism (*uccheda-dṛṣṭi*). This is "grabbing the snake by the tail"—it turns around and bites you with spiritual despair or moral apathy.

---

## Verse 24.14
**sarvaṃ ca yujyate tasya śūnyatā yasya yujyate |**
**sarvaṃ na yujyate tasya śūnyata yasya na yujyate ||**

**Translation**:
"All is logical for him for whom emptiness is logical.
Nothing is logical for him for whom emptiness is not logical."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Great Turning**: This is the heart of the rebuttal. Only if things are Empty can they change, arise, and interact. If things had fixed *svabhāva*, they would be frozen forever. Emptiness is what makes the world work.

## Verse 24.18
**yaḥ pratītyasamutpādaḥ śūnyatāṃ tāṃ pracakṣmahe |**
**sā prajñaptir upādāya pratipat saiva madhyamā ||**

**Translation**:
"Whatever is dependent origination, that we explain as emptiness.
That is a dependent designation; that itself is the Middle Way."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Fourfold Equation**: This verse is the cornerstone of Madhyamaka thought. It equates four distinct concepts:
    1.  **Pratītyasamutpāda** (Dependent Origination): The way things arise.
    2.  **Śūnyatā** (Emptiness): The lack of intrinsic nature in things that arise dependently.
    3.  **Upādāya Prajñapti** (Dependent Designation): Concepts/names exist only in dependence on their basis.
    4.  **Madhyamā Pratipad** (Middle Way): Avoiding the extremes of Existence (Eternalism) and Non-existence (Nihilism).

## Verse 24.20
**yady aśūnyam idaṃ sarvam udayo nāsti na vyayaḥ |**
**catūrṇām āryasatyānāṃ abhāvas te prasajyate ||**

**Translation**:
"If all this were non-empty, there would be no arising and no passing away.
It follows that for you, the non-existence of the Four Noble Truths occurs."

**Commentary**:
*   **Mirror Rebuttal**: Nāgārjuna throws the opponent's first verse (24.1) back at them. If things had *nature* (were non-empty), they could never change. If they can't change, there is no path to liberation. It is the *Opponent* who destroys the Buddha's teaching!

---

## Verse 24.21
**apratītyasamutpannaṃ kuto duḥkhaṃ bhaviṣyati |**
**anityam uktam duḥkhaṃ hi tat svābhāve na vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Whence will there be suffering that is not dependently co-arisen?
For suffering is said to be impermanent; that [impermanence] does not exist in [intrinsic] nature."

**Commentary**:
*   **Suffering requires Emptiness**: If Suffering had a *svabhāva*, it would be permanent. We would suffer forever. It is precisely because Suffering is empty (dependent on causes like ignorance) that it can be brought to an end.

---

## Verse 24.31
**apratītya samutpannaṃ phalaṃ cet kva bhaviṣyati |**
**yo 'pratītyasamutpannaḥ sa dharmaḥ kva bhaviṣyati ||**

**Translation**:
"If the fruit were not dependently co-arisen, how could it exist?
Where will that Dharma exist which is not dependently co-arisen?"

**Commentary**:
*   **The Denial of Practice**: If the result of the path (Nirvana) was a fixed nature, no one could "attain" it, because attainment implies a transition from a state of non-attainment.

---

## Verse 24.36
**sarvasaṃvyavahārāṃś ca laukikān pratibādhasve |**
**yat pratītyasamutpādaśūnyatāṃ pratibādhasve ||**

**Translation**:
"You contradict all worldly conventions and practices
When you contradict the emptiness of dependent origination."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Reversal**: The Nihilist charge is flipped. It is the "Realist" (the believer in *svabhāva*) who is the true Nihilist, because his world is a collection of static, frozen entities that cannot interact or change.

---

## Verse 24.38
**akṛtaṃ cābhyupetaṃ syāt karma duḥkhaṃ ca śāśvatam |**
**svabhāvena sato nityaṃ na hi saṃsaratīsyate ||**

**Translation**:
"If [things] existed by intrinsic nature, they would be eternal and uncreated.
Action would be unperformed, and suffering would be eternal."

---

## Verse 24.40
**yaḥ pratītyasamutpādaṃ paśyatīdaṃ sa paśyati |**
**duḥkhaṃ samudayaṃ caiva nirodhaṃ mārgaṃ eva ca ||**

**Translation**:
"He who sees this dependent origination, he [truly] sees
Suffering, its origin, its cessation, and the path."

**Commentary**:
*   **Conclusion**: To see the emptiness of things is not to deny the Noble Truths, but to see the only way they can possibly be true. Emptiness is the very "heartbeat" of the Buddha's message.# Madhyamakashāstra Chapter 25: Examination of Nirvana (Nirvāṇa-parīkṣā)

## Verse 25.1
**yadi śūnyam idaṃ sarvam udayo nāsti na vyayaḥ |**
**prahāṇād vā nirodhād vā kasy nirvāṇam isyate ||**

**Translation**:
"If all this is empty, there is no arising and no passing away.
Through the abandonment of what, or the cessation of what, is Nirvana desired?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Objection**: The opponent argues that Nirvana requires the cessation (*nirodha*) of defilements. If defilements are empty (never arose), how can they cease? You can't put out a fire that never started.

---

## Verse 25.2
**yady aśūnyam idaṃ sarvam udayo nāsti na vyayaḥ |**
**prahāṇād vā nirodhād vā kasy nirvāṇam isyate ||**

**Translation**:
"If all this is non-empty, there is no arising and no passing away.
Through the abandonment of what, or the cessation of what, is Nirvana desired?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Counter-Objection**: Nāgārjuna flips it. If defilements had intrinsic nature (*svabhāva*), they would be permanent. You could never remove them. Only if they are empty can they be removed.

---

## Verse 25.3
**aprahīṇam asaṃprāptam anucchinnam aśāśvatam |**
**aniruddham anutpannam etan nirvāṇam ucyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Unabandoned, unattained, unannihilated, not eternal,
Unceased, unarisen—this is spoken of as Nirvana."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Definition**: Nirvana is not a "thing" you get or a "state" you enter. It is the quieting of the view of arising and ceasing. It is the nature of reality itself (*dharmatā*).

---

## Verse 25.4
**bhāvas tāvan na nirvāṇaṃ jarāmaraṇalakṣaṇam |**
**prasajyetāsti bhāvo hi na jarāmaraṇaṃ vinā ||**

**Translation**:
"Nirvana is not an entity (*bhāva*), for then it would have the characteristics of old age and death.
For an entity without old age and death does not exist."

**Commentary**:
*   **Not a Thing**: If Nirvana were a "place" or "substance," it would be subject to decay. Paradise implies a Fall.

---

## Verse 25.7
**yadi bhāvo na nirvāṇam abhāvaḥ kiṃ bhaviṣyati |**
**nirvāṇaṃ yatra bhāvo na nābhāvas tatra vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"If Nirvana is not an entity, will it be a non-entity (*abhāva*)?
Where there is no entity, there is no non-entity."

**Commentary**:
*   **Not Nothingness**: Nirvana is not just "blowing out the candle" (annihilation). "Non-entity" depends on "Entity." If Nirvana were *abhāva*, it would be dependent (*upādāya*), and thus impermanent.

---

## Verse 25.9
**ya ājavañjavībhāva upādāya pratītya vā |**
**so 'pratītyānupādāya nirvāṇam upadiśyate ||**

**Translation**:
"That which, when taken dependently or causally, is the state of coming and going (*samsara*)—
That very thing, when not taken dependently or causally, is taught to be Nirvana."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Shift**: Samsara and Nirvana are not two different things. They are the *same thing* seen in two different ways.
    *   **Seen with Grasping**: It is Samsara (birth/death).
    *   **Seen without Grasping**: It is Nirvana (peace).

---

## Verse 25.19
**na saṃsārasya nirvāṇāt kiṃcid asti viśeṣaṇam |**
**na nirvāṇasya saṃsārāt kiṃcid asti viśeṣaṇam ||**

**Translation**:
"There is not the slightest distinction of Samsara from Nirvana.
There is not the slightest distinction of Nirvana from Samsara."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Grand Equation**: Ontologically, they are identical because both are empty of intrinsic nature.
*   **Doctrinal Note**: This does NOT mean that "Suffering is Liberation" (Nihilism) or that "Anything goes" (Moral Relativism). It means that the *nature* of Samsara (Emptiness) is the same as the *nature* of Nirvana (Emptiness). The difference is epistemological: Delusion (*avidyā*) sees separation; Wisdom (*prajñā*) sees the non-dual reality.

---

## Verse 25.20
**nirvāṇasya ca yā koṭiḥ koṭiḥ saṃsaraṇasya ca |**
**na tayor antaraṃ kiṃcit susūkṣmam api vidyate ||**

**Translation**:
"The limit of Nirvana is the limit of Samsara.
Between the two, not even the subtlest interval is found."

**Commentary**:
*   **No Gap**: You don't "leave" Samsara to "go" to Nirvana. You realize the nature of *where you are*. Liberation is not a journey to a distant shore; it is the recognition that the shore was never left.

---

## Verse 25.24
**sarvopalambhopaśamaḥ prapañcopaśamaḥ śivaḥ |**
**na kva cit kasyacit kaścid dharmo buddhena deśitaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"The calming of all objectification, the calming of conceptual proliferation, is peace.
No Dharma whatsoever was taught by the Buddha to anyone anywhere."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Silence**: Ultimately, the Buddha never spoke a word. The teachings were skillful means (*upāya*) projected by the needs of listeners, like an echo. Truth is silence.# Madhyamakashāstra Chapter 26: Examination of the Twelve Links (Dvādaśāṅga-parīkṣā)

## Verse 26.1
**punarbhavāya saṃskārān avidyānivṛtas tridhā |**
**abhisaṃskurute yāṃs taiḥ gatim gacchati karmabhiḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"Obstructed by ignorance, one constructs the three kinds of formations (*saṃskāras*) for rebirth.
By those actions (*karma*), one goes to a destiny (*gati*)."

**Commentary**:
*   **Avidyā-nivṛtas** ("Obstructed by ignorance"): Ignorance of the Four Noble Truths. See **Chapter 24.18** regarding the antidote (Emptiness).
*   **Tridhā** ("Threefold"): Bodily, verbal, and mental formations.

---

## Verse 26.2
**vijñānaṃ saṃniviśate saṃskārapratyayaṃ gatau |**
**saṃniviṣṭe 'tha vijñāne nāmarūpaṃ niṣicyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Consciousness enters into a destiny, dependent on formations.
When consciousness has entered, name-and-form is infused."

**Commentary**:
*   **Vijñāna** ("Consciousness"): The linking consciousness (*pratisandhi-vijñāna*).
*   **Niṣicyate** ("Infused/Conceived"): The union of consciousness with the biological substrate (*nāmarūpa*).

---

## Verse 26.3
**niṣikte nāmarūpe tu ṣaḍāyatanasaṃbhavaḥ |**
**ṣaḍāyatanam āgamya saṃsparśaḥ saṃpravartate ||**

**Translation**:
"When name-and-form is infused, there is the arising of the six sense-spheres.
Depending on the six sense-spheres, contact proceeds."

**Commentary**:
*   **Ṣaḍāyatana** ("Six Spheres"): The five physical senses + the mind.

---

## Verse 26.4
**cakṣuḥ pratītya rūpaṃ ca samanvāhāram eva ca |**
**nāmarūpaṃ pratītyaivaṃ sparśaḥ pravartate ||**

**Translation**:
"Dependent on eye and form and attention,
And dependent on name-and-form, contact proceeds."

**Commentary**:
*   **Sparśa** ("Contact"): The tripartite meeting. See **Chapter 3 (*Cakṣurādi-parīkṣā*)** for the deconstruction of this contact.

---

## Verse 26.5
**sthānaṃ sparśasya tatraiva vedanā tasya sambhavā |**
**vedanāpratyayā tṛṣṇā vedanārtham hi tṛṣyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Feeling arises there as the basis of contact.
Dependent on feeling is craving; for one craves for the sake of feeling."

**Commentary**:
*   **Vedanā** ("Feeling"): Pleasure, pain, or neutral.
*   **Tṛṣṇā** ("Craving"): The turning point. If one meets feeling with mindfulness instead of craving, the chain snaps.

---

## Verse 26.6
**tṛṣyamāṇasya sopādānam upādāne pravartate |**
**upādānāt prabhavati bhavo bhoktuḥ pravartakāḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"For one who is craving, grasping arises in appropriation.
From grasping, becoming arises; [these are] the instigators of the experiencer."

**Commentary**:
*   **Upādāna** ("Grasping"): Intensified craving.
*   **Bhava** ("Becoming"): The karmic force accumulating for the next life.

---

## Verse 26.7
**bhave sati jātiḥ syāj jarāmaraṇam eva ca |**
**duḥkhadaurmanasyaṃ ca śokavyākulatādayaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"When becoming exists, birth occurs; and [from birth], old age and death,
Misery, lamentation, suffering, and despair [arise]."

**Commentary**:
*   **Jāti** ("Birth"): Reappearance in a new set of aggregates.

---

## Verse 26.8
**jāteḥ saṃbhava ity evaṃ kevalasya mahātmanaḥ |**
**duḥkharāśeḥ samudayo deśitaḥ paramarṣiṇā ||**

**Translation**:
"Thus is the arising of birth; and thus is the origin of this entire mass of suffering
Taught by the Supreme Sage."

**Commentary**:
*   **Duḥkha-rāśeḥ** ("Mass of suffering"): Emphasizing that there is no "Person" suffering, only a heap (*rāśi*) of suffering arising.

---

## Verse 26.9
**avidyāyāṃ niruddhāyāṃ saṃskārā na bhavanti hi |**
**avidyāyā nirodhas tu jñānenaivābhāvyate ||**

**Translation**:
"When ignorance ceases, formations indeed do not come to be.
The cessation of ignorance is brought about by meditation with wisdom (*jñāna*)."

**Commentary**:
*   **Jñāna** ("Wisdom"): The realization of Emptiness.

---

## Verse 26.10
**tasya tasya nirodhena tat tan nābhipravartate |**
**duḥkhaskandhaḥ kevalo 'yam evaṃ samyag nirudhyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Through the cessation of each [preceding link], each [succeeding link] does not proceed.
Thus, this entire mass of suffering ceases completely."

**Commentary**:
*   **Pratiloma** ("Reverse Order"): This confirms that Samsara is a construct. If you remove the foundation (Ignorance), the building collapses.

---

## Verse 26.11
**avidyāyāṃ niruddhāyāṃ saṃskārādyam nirudhyate |**
**avidyāyā nirodhas tu jñānenaivābhāvyate ||**

**Translation**:
"When ignorance ceases, formations and the rest cease.
The cessation of ignorance is cultivated by wisdom."

**Commentary**:
*   **Repetition**: Emphasizing the solution.

---

## Verse 26.12
**tasya tasya nirodhena tat tan nābhipravartate |**
**duḥkhaskandhaḥ kevalo 'yam evaṃ samyag nirudhyate ||**

**Translation**:
"Through the cessation of that and that, this and that does not proceed.
Thus this entire mass of suffering ceases completely."

**Commentary**:
*   **Conclusion**: The chapter ends on the note of *Nirodha* (Cessation), preparing the way for the final chapter on Views. See **Chapter 11 (*Pūrvāpara-koṭi*)** regarding the beginninglessness of this chain.# Madhyamakashāstra Chapter 27: Examination of Views (Dṛṣṭi-parīkṣā)

## Verse 27.1
**dṛṣṭayo 'bhūt pūrvaṃ nāham abhūt pūrvam kiṃ nv aham |**
**iti yās tāḥ pūrvāntasamiśritāḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"The views 'I existed in the past' or 'I did not exist in the past'—
These are the views related to the prior limit (the past)."

**Commentary**:
*   **The 14 Unanswered Questions (*Avyākṛta*)**: This chapter addresses the classic metaphysical questions the Buddha refused to answer:
    1. Is the world eternal?
    2. Is the world not eternal?
    3. Is it both?
    4. Is it neither?
    5. Is the world finite?
    6. Is the world infinite?
    7. Is it both?
    8. Is it neither?
    9. Does the Tathāgata exist after death?
    10. Does he not exist?
    11. Both?
    12. Neither?
    13. Is the soul the same as the body?
    14. Is the soul different from the body?
    *Nāgārjuna demonstrates that these questions are flawed because they presuppose a "Self" or "World" with intrinsic nature.*

---

## Verse 27.2
**dṛṣṭayo na bhaviṣyāmy aham kim nu bhaviṣyāmy aham |**
**iti yās tāś cāparāntasamiśritāḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"The views 'I will exist in the future' or 'I will not exist in the future'—
These are the views related to the posterior limit (the future)."

**Commentary**:
*   **Aparānta** ("Posterior Limit"): Speculation about the destiny of the self. Immortality vs. Annihilation.

---

## Verse 27.3
**abhūt pūrvam ity eṣa na yujyata iyam dṛṣṭiḥ |**
**yaḥ kṣamaś ca pūrvasya sa naivāyam na cānyaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"The view 'I existed in the past' is not logical.
For that one who existed in the past is not this one, nor is he other than this one."

**Commentary**:
*   **Naiva ayam** ("Not this one"): If I am exactly the same as my past self, I would be an infant right now.
*   **Na ca anyaḥ** ("Not other"): If I am totally different, I would not inherit the karma of that infant.

---

## Verse 27.6
**na copapadyate saiva yadi hi syāt sa eva saḥ |**
**upādānam viyuktam syād evaṃ hi syād anityatā ||**

**Translation**:
"It is not logical that it is the very same [self]. For if it were the very same,
The grasper would be distinct from the grasping. And in that case, [the self] would be permanent."

**Commentary**:
*   **Upādāna** ("Grasping/Aggregates"): If the Self stays the same while the body changes, the Self is separate from the body. A disembodied Self is a fiction.

---

## Verse 27.8
**na caivāsty anupādānaḥ sa cātmā nāsty upādānam |**
**na cāsti sa cātmā nāsty upādānavān ||**

**Translation**:
"There is no self without grasping; nor is the self the grasping.
Nor is the self the possessor of grasping."

**Commentary**:
*   **The Middle Way**: The Self is not the body, not separate from the body, and doesn't own the body. It is a label applied to the flow.

---

## Verse 27.13
**antavān sa loka iti kiṃ etad upapadyate |**
**yasmān na cānyo nānyo hi saṃtāne pūrvajanmanaḥ ||**

**Translation**:
"The view 'The world is finite'—how is this logical?
For the continuum of previous births is not other, nor is it non-other."

**Commentary**:
*   **Antavān** ("Finite"): Does the world end? If the self is a continuum (*saṃtāna*), there is no hard line where "I" stop and "World" begins.

---

## Verse 27.19
**kuto 'ntasyāpy abhāve 'nantaṃ nāma bhaviṣyati |**
**anantasyāpy abhāve kuto 'ntavan nāma bhaviṣyati ||**

**Translation**:
"In the absence of the finite, whence will there be the infinite?
In the absence of the infinite, whence will there be the finite?"

**Commentary**:
*   **Mutual Dependence**: Finite and Infinite are relative terms. You cannot assert one without the other. Both are conceptual constructs (*kalpanā*).

---

## Verse 27.30 (The Final Homage)
**sarvadṛṣṭiprahāṇāya yaḥ saddharmam adeśayat |**
**anukampām upādāya taṃ namasyāmi gautamam ||**

**Translation**:
"To Him who taught the True Dharma for the relinquishing of all views,
Out of compassion—I bow down to that Gautama."

**Commentary**:
*   **Sarva-dṛṣṭi-prahāṇāya** ("For the relinquishing of all views"): This is the thesis statement of the entire MMK. Madhyamaka is not a view; it is the medicine to vomit out all views.
*   **Cross-Reference**: See **Chapter 24.14** ("All is logical for him for whom emptiness is logical"). The abandonment of views allows for the dynamic functioning of the world.
