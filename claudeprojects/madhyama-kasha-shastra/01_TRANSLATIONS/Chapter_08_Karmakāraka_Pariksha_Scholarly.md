# Chapter 8: Examination of Action and Agent (Karmakāraka-parīkṣā)

## Introduction

Chapter 8, *Karmakāraka-parīkṣā*, represents a critical application of Nāgārjuna's dialectical method to the core components of ethical and soteriological thought: **action** (*karma*) and the **agent** who performs it (*kāraka*). 

Building upon the analysis of conditioned factors (*saṃskāra*) in Chapter 7 and the relationship between the characterized and the characteristic in Chapter 5, this chapter directly addresses the **Abhidharmic ontology** of real (*dravya*) entities underlying moral responsibility. The central dilemma: if agent and action are each intrinsically real, how do they relate? If identical, the distinction collapses. If different, their connection is inexplicable.

This analysis is crucial for Buddhist ethics: karma requires an agent and action, but neither can be found with *svabhāva*. The chapter demonstrates that moral responsibility is possible precisely *because* of emptiness—not despite it.

## Kārikā 8.1

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*kārakaḥ sa iti jñeyo yaś ca kuryāt sa eva hi |*
*kṛtaṃ tat karma vijñeyaṃ yena tat kriyate'khilam ||*

**Translation**:
The agent¹ is to be understood as that [being] who would do [something]. That which is done² completely by that [agent] is to be understood as the action.

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
Candrakīrti opens by stating the conventional definitions. The agent is identified by what it does; the action is identified by who does it. The question: can these definitions survive ultimate analysis?

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Sanskrit] *kāraka* (कारक): Agent, doer; grammatically, the instrumental case in action.
² [Sanskrit] *karma* (कर्म): Action, deed; also the object of the verb in Sanskrit grammar.

---

## Kārikā 8.2

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*kārakaḥ pūrvam utpanno yaḥ kurvīta yathā kvacit |*
*kārakāt karma niṣpannaṃ yadi kārakaḥ syād akarmakaḥ ||*

**Translation**:
If the agent arises first¹ and would then do [something]—if action were accomplished [only] from an agent—then the agent would be without action.²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
If the agent exists as a completed entity *before* acting, then at that moment it is "action-less" (*akarmaka*). But what makes it an "agent" if it has no action? The very designation depends on the presence of action.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Dialectical] Temporal priority dilemma: same as MMK 6 with desire/desirous.
² [Philosophical] An "agent without action" is a contradiction in terms—like a "mover without motion."

---

## Kārikā 8.3

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*karma pūrvaṃ bhaved yadi tataḥ kartā kutaḥ param |*
*akartṛkaṃ bhavet karma yadi karma kathaṃ bhavet ||*

**Translation**:
If action were prior,¹ then from what [source] would there be an agent? If action were without an agent,² how could there be action?

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
The reverse problem: if action exists first, it floats free of any subject. But action without someone doing it is meaningless—"walking" without a walker.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Sanskrit] *karma pūrvam*: "action first"—action temporally preceding agent.
² [Sanskrit] *akartṛka* (अकर्तृक): "without an agent."

---

## Kārikā 8.4

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*kārakāt karma nirmuktaṃ na ca kārakas tato bhavet |*
*tathā karmaiva kāryaṃ syān na ca kārya vinā bhavet ||*

**Translation**:
Action freed from the agent¹ does not exist; nor does the agent [exist independently] therefrom. Similarly, action itself would be the product,² but there is no product without [action].

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
The mutual dependence is fully exposed. Neither can stand alone. They require each other for their very identity.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Philosophical] *nirmuktam*: "freed from," "apart from"—testing independent existence.
² [Sanskrit] *kārya* (कार्य): Effect, product, what is to be done.

---

## Kārikā 8.5

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*kārakaḥ karma ca dvayaṃ saṃsṛtau hetuḥ iṣyate |*
*tau cen mithyā kathaṃ hetuḥ mithyayoḥ syāt phalaṃ param ||*

**Translation**:
The agent and action, [this] pair, are accepted as the cause of saṃsāra.¹ But if these two are unreal, how could the fruit [arise] from unreal [causes]?²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
Candrakīrti anticipates the opponent's objection: "If agent and action are empty, karma-theory collapses!" The answer: emptiness doesn't mean non-existence; it means lack of *svabhāva*. Conventional causation remains.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Sanskrit] *saṃsāra* (संसार): Cyclic existence, the round of rebirths.
² [Dialectical] This is the opponent's fear of nihilism—addressed in following verses.

---

## Kārikā 8.6

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*phalasya syād asadbhāvo yathā hetvartha iṣyate |*
*hetoś ca syād asadbhāvaḥ phalaḥ syāt katham anyathā ||*

**Translation**:
Just as the existence of the fruit¹ [depends on] the cause, so the cause [depends on] the fruit. How could the fruit be otherwise [than dependently existent]?²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
The solution: both cause and fruit are dependently arisen. Neither is independently real. This *is* the Middle Way—avoiding both eternalism (they're real) and nihilism (nothing exists).

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Sanskrit] *phala* (फल): Fruit, result, karmic outcome.
² [Philosophical] Mutual dependence is the very structure of conventional reality.

---

## Kārikā 8.7

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*tathā kārakakarmaṇoḥ pratyekaṃ siddhi nāsti hi |*
*itaretarataḥ siddhir iti cen nāyam īpsitam ||*

**Translation**:
Thus, individually there is no establishment of agent and action.¹ If [you say] they are established mutually from each other,² this is not desirable.

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
The opponent might try: "They establish each other!" But this is *anyonyāśraya*—mutual dependence—which the opponent cannot accept if they insist on *svabhāva*.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Dialectical] Neither agent nor action can be found independently.
² [Sanskrit] *itaretarataḥ*: "from each other," mutually.

---

## Kārikā 8.8

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*naikatvena na nānātve kārakakarmaṇoḥ sthitiḥ |*
*ekāntena vinā cāpi sthitir nopapadyate ||*

**Translation**:
The position of agent and action is not [established] through identity nor through difference.¹ And without either extreme, [their] position is not tenable.²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
The characteristic Mādhyamaka move: identity collapses the distinction; difference severs the relation. Neither works for intrinsically real entities.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Philosophical] The *ekatva-nānātva* (identity-difference) analysis from MMK 6.
² [Cross-reference] Same logic applied to desire/desirous (Ch. 6), fire/fuel (Ch. 10).

---

## Kārikā 8.9

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*naikatvena ca kāryaṃ syān nānātvenāpi kā gatiḥ |*
*dvābhyāṃ na syād ubhābhyāṃ vā na ca syāt tadvinā punaḥ ||*

**Translation**:
The product is not [established] through identity, nor through difference—what possibility is there?¹ It is not [established] through both, nor without both.²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
The tetralemma is applied to the *kārya* (product/effect) as well. All four logical positions fail.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Sanskrit] *gati* (गति): Course, possibility, meaning.
² [Philosophical] *Catuṣkoṭi* applied: neither same, different, both, nor neither.

---

## Kārikā 8.10

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*etena hetuphalayoḥ kramaḥ siddho na vidyate |*
*yadi kramaḥ pūrvāparaḥ syād anyonyata eva vā ||*

**Translation**:
By this [analysis], no sequence of cause and result is found to be established¹—whether [the sequence is] prior-and-posterior or mutual.²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
The temporal and logical ordering of cause and effect also fails. Neither "cause first, then effect" nor "they arise together" can be coherently maintained for intrinsically real entities.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Dialectical] The sequence (*krama*) presupposes what it's trying to establish.
² [Cross-reference] Parallels MMK 1 on causation; MMK 7 on arising.

---

## Kārikā 8.11

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*kārakakarmavimuktau tu na ca vedanā sthitau |*
*sākṣiṇī vedanā cet syāt kārakasyāpi sākṣiṇī ||*

**Translation**:
If freed from agent and action, feeling¹ [too] would not be established. If feeling were a witness, it would be a witness of the agent also.²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
The analysis extends to *vedanā* (feeling)—one of the five aggregates. If agent and action are empty, so is the one who experiences. This does not negate experience; it clarifies its dependent nature.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Sanskrit] *vedanā* (वेदना): Feeling, sensation; one of the five *skandhas*.
² [Philosophical] The "witness" (experiencer) is also dependently arisen.

---

## Kārikā 8.12

**Sanskrit (IAST)**:
*evaṃ kārakakarmaṇoḥ śūnyatāyāṃ prasādhite |*
*sarvabhāvānāṃ śūnyatvaṃ draṣṭavyaṃ tena hetunā ||*

**Translation**:
Thus, when the emptiness of agent and action is established, the emptiness of all entities¹ should be seen by that very reasoning.²

**Commentary (Prasannapadā)**:
The chapter concludes with universalization. The agent-action analysis is a model for understanding *all* phenomena. What applies here applies everywhere.

**Footnotes**:
¹ [Sanskrit] *sarvabhāvānām*: "of all entities/phenomena."
² [Soteriological] This seeing (*draṣṭavyam*) is liberating insight—not mere theory.

### Key Concepts

| Term | Sanskrit | Meaning |
|------|----------|---------|
| **kāraka** | कारक | Agent, doer; the instrumental factor in action |
| **karma** | कर्म | Action, deed; also karmic act and its residue |
| **kārya** | कार्य | Effect, product; what is accomplished |
| **akarmaka** | अकर्मक | Without action; actionless |
| **akartṛka** | अकर्तृक | Without agent; agentless |
| **saṃsāra** | संसार | Cyclic existence; rounds of rebirth |
| **phala** | फल | Fruit, result; karmic outcome |
| **vedanā** | वेदना | Feeling, sensation |

### Argument Structure

**Pūrvapakṣa (Opponent's Position)**:
The Abhidharma holds that agents and actions are real *dharmas*. The agent is the kāraka-factor in a karmic event; the action is the karma. These must be genuinely distinct yet genuinely related for moral responsibility to function.

**Mādhyamaka Response**:

1. **Temporal Priority Fails** (8.2-3): Neither agent nor action can be prior to the other without losing its definition.

2. **Identity/Difference Fails** (8.4, 8.8-9): If identical, no distinction; if different, no connection.

3. **Mutual Dependence Exposed** (8.6-7): They are established only in relation to each other—*pratītyasamutpanna*.

4. **Emptiness Saves Karma** (8.5-6, 8.12): Emptiness doesn't destroy karma-theory; it provides its only coherent foundation.

5. **Universalization** (8.12): This analysis applies to all phenomena.
