## Verse 9.1

### I. Source Text
**darśanaśravaṇādīni vedanādīni cāpy atha |**
**bhaṅgādīnīti cāpy eṣāṃ tatteṣām asti no vā ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"Seeing, hearing, and the like; as well as feeling and the like;
And the destroyed [elements] and the like—does 'That' [the Prior Entity] belong to them, or not?"

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Darśana-śravaṇa-ādīni** ("Seeing, hearing, etc."): Refers to the six sense faculties (*indriya*) and their operations. The opponent argues these are instruments (*karaṇa*), implying an agent (*kartṛ*). *Note: The argument hinges on the grammatical requirement that an instrument (e.g., a telescope) requires a user. Nāgārjuna denies this duality.*
*   **Vedanādīni** ("Feeling, etc."): Refers to the five aggregates (*skandha*), specifically the mental factors that accompany experience.
*   **Tat-teṣām** ("That of them"): "That" (*tat*) refers to the *Pūrva* (Prior Entity/Self). The genitive *teṣām* ("of them") indicates possession. The question is ontological: Does a possessor exist prior to the possessed?

### IV. The Blues Interpretation
**Title: "Nobody Before the Blues"**

(Verse 1)
They say there’s a Watcher waitin' ‘fore the sun comes up,
(Yeah, some secret soul pourin' coffee in the cup)
But if nobody’s tastin’, tell me who’s to blame?
Without the hurtin’, baby, you ain't got no name.

## Verse 9.2

### I. Source Text
**teṣāṃ caiva bhaved bhāvaḥ kas teṣāṃ ca bhaviṣyati |**
**darśanaśravaṇādīni vedanādīni cāpy atha ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"If 'That' [the Entity] were to exist [prior], how could it exist for them?
[And if it exists through them], then seeing, hearing, and the like [would exist independent of it]."

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Bhaved bhāvaḥ** ("Were to exist"): Conditional tense. Nāgārjuna grants the premise for the sake of argument.
*   **Kas teṣāṃ** ("Who for them?"): If the Soul exists *before* seeing, it is blind. How can a blind Soul be the "Seer" of seeing? The relationship of appropriation (*upādāna*) is impossible without the appropriated (*upādeya*).

### IV. The Blues Interpretation

(Verse 2)
If you sittin' in the dark before you turn the light,
(Tell me, brother, are you blind or is it night?)
You claim you’re the Singer before you sing the song,
But a ghost without a guitar can’t play along.

---

## Verse 9.3

### I. Source Text
**atha kaścid bhaved bhāvaḥ prāk tebhyo 'sti sa kiṃ mataḥ |**
**sa ca taṃ parigṛhṇīyād bhāvo bhāvaṃ hi kasya cit ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"If some entity were to exist prior to those [faculties], what is it considered to be?
And [if] that entity appropriates them, then indeed, that entity belongs to whom?"

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Prāk** ("Prior"): The central target of this chapter. Temporal priority implies ontological independence.
*   **Parigṛhṇīyād** ("Should appropriate"): From root *grah* (to grasp). The Self is defined as the *grasper* of the aggregates. But if the grasper exists before the grasping, what is it grasping?

### IV. The Blues Interpretation

(Verse 3)
You say you’re the Driver before you bought the car,
(Standin' on the corner, wishin' on a star)
But if you ain't got no wheels, you ain't grabbin' the street,
Can’t own the rhythm, Lord, without the beat.

---

## Verse 9.4

### I. Source Text
**pṛthag bhāvo 'samāptaś ca na deśo 'sti na kālaḥ |**
**na bhāvaḥ kuta evāsya pṛthag bhāvo bhaviṣyati ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"A separate entity is not established; neither place nor time exists [for it].
If the entity does not exist [independently], how can a separate entity come to be?"

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Pṛthag bhāva** ("Separate entity"): The Soul/Self (*ātman*) posited as existing apart from the aggregates.
*   **Asamāpta** ("Not concluded/established"): Without the characteristics of seeing, etc., the entity has no definition. It is a "sky-flower."

### IV. The Blues Interpretation

(Verse 4)
You say you’re the Captain, separate from the ship,
(Standin' on dry land while the vessel takes a dip)
But a Captain with no boat, Lord, he ain't got no crew,
You’re just a lonely shadow with nothin' left to do.

---

## Verse 9.5

### I. Source Text
**yadi ca syāt pṛthag bhāvo darśanādeḥ pṛthak tataḥ |**
**syāt pṛthag darśanādy eva bhāvena tu vinā bhavet ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"And if a separate entity were to exist, distinct from seeing and so forth,
Then seeing and so forth would exist separately, existing indeed without that entity."

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Vinā bhavet** ("Would exist without"): The consequence of dualism. If the Self is independent of Seeing, then Seeing should function without a Self. But "seeing without a seer" is absurd to the opponent.

### IV. The Blues Interpretation

(Verse 5)
If the Blues can hurt you when you ain't around,
(Like a ghost guitar makin' a lonesome sound)
Then the pain don't need you, baby, to make it real,
It’s just a broken heart that forgot how to feel.

---

## Verse 9.6

### I. Source Text
**kasya cit kim cid evāsti na ca bhāvo 'sti kasya cit |**
**na ca bhāvena vināsti darśanādi kuto bhavet ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"Someone has something, but no entity belongs to anyone.
And without an entity, seeing and so forth does not exist; whence could it arise?"

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Kasya cit** ("Of someone"): The grammatical relation of possession requires two terms. If the "Owner" is a fiction, the "Owned" (the eye, the ear) loses its status as an instrument.

### IV. The Blues Interpretation

(Verse 6)
You say "This is my hammer," you say "This is my song,"
(But tell me, Mr. Owner, where do you belong?)
If there ain't no "You," there ain't no "Mine,"
Just empty boxcars rollin' down the line.

---

## Verse 9.7

### I. Source Text
**na ca bhāvo 'sti bāhyo 'pi na ca bhāvo 'sti cāntaraḥ |**
**na cāsti bhāvo bāhyo 'pi kuto bhāvo bhaviṣyati ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"The entity implies neither an external nor an internal existence.
And neither does the external entity exist; whence will the entity exist?"

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Bāhyo/Antaraḥ** ("External/Internal"): The Self is not outside the aggregates (like a Pilot) nor inside them (like a Seed).

### IV. The Blues Interpretation

(Verse 7)
I checked the front porch, I checked the kitchen floor,
(Looking for the Man who don't live here no more)
He ain't outside knocking, he ain't inside hidin',
Just a rumour of a Ghost that we all abidin'.

---

## Verse 9.8

### I. Source Text
**evam eva hi sarveṣāṃ gamanaṃ pratiṣidhyate |**
**gantā ca gamanād anyo nanyas tasmān na vidyate ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"In this very way, the going of all [senses] is refuted.
The goer is not other than the going, nor is he non-other; thus he is not found."

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Gantā/Gamana** ("Goer/Going"): Nāgārjuna recycles the argument from Chapter 2 (*Gatāgata-parīkṣā*). The Agent (*kartṛ*) cannot be established as identical to nor distinct from the Action (*kriyā*).

### IV. The Blues Interpretation

(Verse 8)
You can't have a Walker if the Road is gone,
(Can't have a Singer if there ain't no Song)
If you ain't movin', baby, you ain't standin' still,
Just a imaginary figure on a imaginary hill.

---

## Verse 9.9

### I. Source Text
**gantā ca gamanād anyo nanyas tasmān na vidyate |**
**gamanāny api sarvāṇi gatyā gatir nivāryate ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"The goer is not other than the going, nor is he non-other; thus he is not found.
All goings are prevented by the [analysis of] going by means of going."

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Na vidyate** ("Is not found"): The final ontological dismissal. The Agent is a conceptual fiction imputed upon the stream of action.

### IV. The Blues Interpretation

(Verse 9)
I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride,
(Looked in the mirror, but there was no one inside)
I ain't the Walker, Lord, and I ain't the Road,
Just a heavy burden without no heavy load.

---

## Verse 9.10-9.12 (Conclusion)

### I. Source Text
**tasmād darśanādīni vedanādīni cāpy atha |**
**bhaṅgādīnīti cāpy eṣāṃ tatteṣām asti no vā ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"Therefore, seeing and the like, and feeling and the like,
And the destroyed elements—'That' [Prior Entity] does not exist for them."

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Tasmād** ("Therefore"): Conclusion (*nigamana*).
*   **Asti no vā** ("Exists or not"): The dilemma is resolved by negation. The *Pūrva* (Prior Self) is a conceptual fiction (*prapañca*).

### IV. The Blues Interpretation

(Verse 10-12)
So pack up your suitcase, leave your name behind,
(There ain't no "Me" that the devil can find)
The seeing happens, baby, but the Seer is gone,
Just the morning light breakin' on the dawn.
