**Title: "The Domino Effect"**

(Verse 1)
Ignorance is the Warden, he holds the only key,
(Keepin' you locked up in this ancient misery)
He tells you "Build a Future," he tells you "Make a Plan,"
That’s how you build the prison for the soul of a man.

(Verse 2)
The Mind jumps in the Cradle, lookin' for a home,
(Afraid to walk the darkness all alone)
It finds a brand new body, a brand new name,
But it’s the same old player in the same old game.

(Verse 3)
Then the Eyes open up, and the Ears start to hear,
(The world comes rushin' in, loud and clear)
The Senses touch the Fire, the Senses touch the Ice,
Rollin' the bones on the devil’s dice.

(Verse 5)
It feels so good, you want it to stay,
(It feels so bad, you want it away)
That’s the Thirst, baby, the dryin' of the bone,
Craving for a water that you’ve never known.

(Verse 6)
You grab it with your hands, you grab it with your soul,
(Tryin' to fill the bottom of a bottomless hole)
The Grabbin' makes the Becomin', the Becomin' makes the Birth,
And you’re back on the treadmill of this weary earth.

(Verse 7)
Then comes the Grey Hair, then comes the Pain,
(Tears fallin' down like the monsoon rain)
The coffin and the graveyard, the sorrow and the grief,
Just a tragic ending to a story brief.

(Verse 9)
But if you kill the Warden, the prisoners go free,
(If you turn on the light, the shadows flee)
Wisdom is the hammer that breaks the heavy chain,
Stoppin' the wheel in the driving rain.

(Verse 10)
One by one, the dominoes stop their fall,
(No more writin' on the prison wall)
No more Birth, no more Dyin' Breath,
Just a silence sweeter than the face of Death.
The Mass of Sorrow crumbles into dust,
In the empty wind of the perfect trust.
