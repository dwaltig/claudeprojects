**Title: "The Blame Game"**

(Verse 1)
Did I break my own heart, or did you break it too?
(Was it me, was it them, or a demon in the blue?)
Everybody’s guessin' where the trouble began,
But pointin' fingers, baby, ain't the master plan.

(Verse 2)
If I built this prison, then I hold the key,
(But I don't remember lockin' up the real me)
If the man I was yesterday is dead and gone,
Then who is this stranger singin' this sad song?

(Verse 3)
If you built this prison, just to watch me cry,
(Like a cruel puppet master in the big blue sky)
Then I’m servin' time for a crime I didn't do,
And that ain't justice, Lord, that’s just the blues.

(Verse 4)
If I’m the Sufferer before the pain arrives,
(Livin' in the shadows of a thousand lives)
Who am I without the hurt to say my name?
Just a hollow echo in a burnin' flame.

(Verse 5)
If the pain is floatin' free, without a soul to bite,
(Like a rabid dog howlin' in the middle of the night)
It don't belong to me, and it don't belong to you,
Just a phantom misery passin' through.

(Verse 6)
You say it’s "Someone Else," but who are you to say?
(Without a "Me" to stand here, "You" just fade away)
We’re leanin' on each other like a house of cards,
Fallin' down together in the same backyards.

(Verse 7)
I can't hurt myself 'cause I ain't solid ground,
(I’m changin' like the weather when the wind comes 'round)
And you can't hurt me neither, 'cause we’re intertwined,
Like the rhythm and the melody in the same old mind.

(Verse 8)
It wasn't me alone, and it wasn't just the town,
(It wasn't both together that brought the hammer down)
Two wrongs don't make a right, two ghosts don't make a man,
Tryin' to catch the wind with a broken hand.

(Verse 9)
It didn't come from nothin', like a bolt from the blue,
(Sufferin' has a reason, just like me and you)
If it fell out of the sky without a seed to grow,
We’d be cryin' forever with nowhere to go.

(Verse 10)
It ain't just the heartache, it’s the tree and the stone,
(Nothin' in this world ever stands alone)
The flower needs the rain, and the rain needs the cloud,
Ain't nobody separate, ain't nobody proud.
