# Chapter 1: Looking at What Makes Things Happen
## *When You Search for Where It All Comes From*

### Blues Vernacular Translation by Master John Kim

## Opening: Bowing to the One Who Saw It Clear

*Before we begin, let me pay respect to the man who showed the way—Nāgārjuna, the teacher who didn't sell us nothing, just showed us what ain't real so we could finally be free.*

---

Now, friends, I've been studying what the Professor laid down, and I'm here to tell you—this first chapter of the Middle Way is about one thing: **looking real hard at cause and effect, and finding out there ain't nothing solid there.**

That might sound like bad news. But it ain't. It's the best news you ever heard.

---

## Part One: The Eight Ways Things Ain't What You Think

> *Neither stopping nor starting,  
> Neither cut off nor going on forever,  
> Neither all one thing nor all different things,  
> Neither coming in nor going out—*
>
> *The one who taught how everything leans on everything else,  
> How all that noise in your head gets quiet,  
> How there's peace at the end of all this—  
> That fully awake one, the best who ever spoke,  
> Him I bow to.*¹

That's the dedication, friends. Nāgārjuna's bowing to the Buddha, and he's telling us right from the start what this whole teaching is about: **dependent origination**—everything leaning on everything else, nothing standing on its own two feet.

And when you really see that? All that mental chatter, all that *prapañca*—it **quiets down**. That's what *śivam* means—"the auspicious," "the peaceful."

---

## Part Two: The Four-Corner Knockout

> *Not from itself, not from something else,  
> Not from both, and not from nothing—  
> Never, nowhere, no way,  
> Has anything ever really come into being.*²

Now here's where the Bluesman's gotta be honest with you. This verse right here? It's the whole teaching in four lines. Four ways folks think things get made—and Nāgārjuna knocks 'em all down:

| What They Say | What It Means | Why It Don't Work |
|:--------------|:--------------|:------------------|
| **From itself** | "Already had it in me" | Then why you still struggling? |
| **From something else** | "Something outside made me" | But where's that thing's nature? |
| **From both** | "It's complicated" | Two wrongs don't make a right |
| **From nothing** | "It just happened" | Then anything could happen anytime |

See, the Sāṃkhya folks—they say everything was already there in the cause, just hidden. Like the butter was always in the milk. But if it's already there, friend, **why you churning?** What's the point of the work if the job's already done?

And the folks who say "something else made it"—well, we'll get to them. That's what this whole chapter's about.

---

## Part Three: The Four Conditions (What the Buddha Taught)

Now, here's where it gets tricky. The Buddha *did* teach about conditions. He said there are four kinds:

> *The cause, the object, what came right before,  
> And what had the power to let it happen—  
> Those are the four conditions.  
> Ain't no fifth one.*³

1. **The Cause** (*hetu*) — Like the seed is to the sprout
2. **The Object** (*ālambana*) — What your mind is reaching toward
3. **What Came Right Before** (*anantara*) — The moment that just passed away
4. **The Dominant One** (*adhipati*) — Whatever had the power to let it happen

And Nāgārjuna says: **Ain't no fifth one.** God, fate, destiny, luck—whatever you want to call it—ain't on the list.⁴

---

## Part Four: But Wait—Where's the Nature?

Here's where the Blues comes in. Because after laying out what the Buddha taught, Nāgārjuna looks *into* those conditions and asks the hard question:

> *There ain't no solid nature of things  
> Hiding in those conditions.  
> And if there ain't no solid nature,  
> How you gonna have "other-nature"?*⁵

See, the folks who say "things come from other things"—they need two solid things to make that work. The cause gotta be *really there*, and the effect gotta be *really there*, and they gotta be *really different* from each other.

But here's the trouble: **the seed and the sprout are never there at the same time.** When you got the seed, ain't no sprout. When you got the sprout, the seed done gone. So where's this "otherness" supposed to live?

It's like saying "east" without "west." You can't have one without the other. And if one ain't there yet, you ain't got neither.

---

## Part Five: The Action Problem

Some folks try to get clever. They say: "Okay, maybe the conditions don't *directly* make the effect. Maybe there's an *action* in between—like cooking makes the rice."

Nāgārjuna shuts that down too:

> *Action ain't got conditions,  
> Action ain't without conditions,  
> Conditions ain't got action,  
> Conditions ain't without action.*⁶

Four ways to try it, four ways to fail. The action can't hook up with the conditions no matter how you slice it.

---

## Part Six: The Timing Problem

Here's another one that'll twist your mind:

> *"It arises depending on these"—  
> So they say these are conditions.  
> But as long as it ain't arisen yet,  
> How come they ain't non-conditions?*⁷

A condition is only a condition *of something*. But if that something ain't there yet, what's it a condition *of*? It's like calling someone a father before the child is born. The relation don't exist yet.

---

## Part Seven: The Big Dilemma

Now we get to the heart of it:

> *Neither for what don't exist  
> Nor for what already exists  
> Does a condition make sense.  
> If it don't exist, condition of what?  
> If it already exists, why need a condition?*⁸

This is the Blues truth right here, friends:

- **If the effect don't exist yet**, how can you cause it? You can't push on nothing.
- **If the effect already exists**, what are you causing? The work's already done.

Either way, causation falls apart when you look too close.

---

## Part Eight: The Conclusion

After all this looking, all this breaking it down, Nāgārjuna wraps it up:

> *So the effect don't come from conditions,  
> And it don't exist without conditions either—  
> So where would anything come from  
> That's got conditions in it?*⁹

The effect ain't *in* the conditions. But it ain't *outside* them either. It's not that causation don't work—we see things happening all day long. But when you look for the solid, standalone, self-existing **nature** of cause and effect... **ain't nothing there.**

---

## What This Means for Your Life

Now here's where the preaching stops and the living starts.

You've been carrying around a whole lot of ideas about what caused your trouble. Maybe you blame yourself—"I made this mess." Maybe you blame somebody else—"They did this to me." Maybe you blame both, or you threw up your hands and said "It just happened."

All four of those are **ideas**. And when you look for the solid reality behind them—when you really dig in and ask "What is this self that made the mess? What is this other that hurt me?"—you find... **the same emptiness Nāgārjuna found.**

And that ain't nihilism.¹⁰ That's **freedom**.

Because if your trouble wasn't made by a solid self, you ain't anchored to it. If it wasn't made by a solid other, you ain't trapped by them. The whole chain of "who done what to who" starts to loosen up.

That's the first step off the wheel.

---

## Endnotes

¹ **"All that noise in your head"**: This is *prapañca* in Sanskrit—the proliferation of concepts, arguments, distinctions that keep the mind spinning. When you see emptiness, the noise dies down.

² **"Never, nowhere, no way"**: Nāgārjuna uses three indefinite pronouns (*jātu*, *kvacana*, *kecana*) to emphasize the absolute universality of this negation. He means it: *nothing* has *ever* arisen with inherent nature.

³ **"Ain't no fifth one"**: This explicitly excludes God (*īśvara*), cosmic will, or any supernatural cause. The Buddha's teaching is naturalistic—things arise from conditions, not from divine fiat.

⁴ **"God ain't on the list"**: Candrakīrti is very clear about this. The Nyāya school tried to add a divine creator as a necessary condition. Buddhism says: nope.

⁵ **"Other-nature"**: This is the key move. "Arising from other" (*parataḥ*) requires two really existing things in relation. But cause and effect are never present at the same moment. So "otherness" can't be established.

⁶ **"Four ways to fail"**: This is another *catuṣkoṭi* (tetralemma). Mādhyamaka loves these—showing that all four logical possibilities lead to contradiction.

⁷ **"Calling someone a father before the child is born"**: Relations require both relata to exist. If the effect doesn't exist yet, the relation "condition-of" can't hold.

⁸ **"You can't push on nothing"**: The non-existent can't be affected. And the already-existent doesn't need affecting. Causation slips through the cracks.

⁹ **"Ain't nothing there"**: This isn't saying things don't happen. It's saying they don't happen with *svabhāva*—with inherent, standalone existence. They happen *dependently*, *relatively*, *conventionally*.

¹⁰ **"That ain't nihilism"**: The whole point of Mādhyamaka is to walk the middle way between eternalism (things have fixed natures) and nihilism (nothing matters). Emptiness isn't "nothing exists"—it's "nothing exists *the way you think it does*."

---

### Theological Notes

**For those who want the deep doctrine:**

This chapter establishes that **dependent origination** (*pratītyasamutpāda*) and **emptiness** (*śūnyatā*) are two words for the same truth. Things arise dependently—that's the conventional truth. When you look for their inherent nature—that's when you find emptiness.

The four conditions are not rejected—they function perfectly well on the conventional level. What's rejected is the idea that they have **inherent causal power** (*svabhāva*). The seed doesn't contain some essence-of-sprout that it passes along. The relationship is **empty of inherent nature** but **full of functional dependency**.

This is the foundation for everything that follows in the Middle Way. If you understand this chapter, you understand the whole teaching.

# Chapter 2: Looking at Coming and Going
## *When You Search for the Walker Walking*

### Blues Vernacular Translation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening

*Now friends, this second chapter is going to mess with your head a little. Nāgārjuna's about to take the most obvious thing in the world—walking from here to there—and show you ain't nothing solid in it neither. If motion falls apart under the looking-glass, everything else will too.*

---

## Part One: The Three Kinds of Space

Let me lay it out plain. When you're walking down the road, the philosophers say there's three kinds of space:

1. **Where you been** (*gata*) — the ground behind you
2. **Where you going** (*agata*) — the ground ahead of you  
3. **Where you're at** (*gamyamāna*) — the ground under your feet right now

And here's the first truth:

> *Where you been ain't being walked—  
> You already walked it, it's done.  
> Where you going ain't being walked—  
> You ain't got there yet.  
> And that space you're standing in?  
> Apart from "been" and "going,"  
> There ain't no "standing in" to find.*¹

See, the ground behind you—the walking already stopped there. Saying "it's being walked" is like saying yesterday is happening now. Can't be.

The ground ahead—no walking started there yet. Can't say "it's being walked" about somewhere your feet ain't touched.

And the ground under you? Try to find it separate from "already walked" and "not yet walked." You can't. Like trying to find the present moment between past and future—it slips right through your fingers.

---

## Part Two: Where's the Activity?

Now the opponent speaks up. He says:

> "Wait a minute. I see my feet moving. I see the activity right here, right now. The walking's happening in the space I'm crossing. Not behind me, not ahead—right here."²

Fair enough. Seems solid. But watch what happens when you look closer.

---

## Part Three: The Double-Walking Problem

Here's where it gets interesting:

> *How can there be walking in the "being-walked"  
> When double walking don't make sense?*³

See, to call this space "being-walked," you already used up one walking. The word *gamyamāna* (being-walked) means walking's happening there. 

Now you want to add "*and it's being walked*"?

That's two walkings. And friend, you only got one pair of feet.⁴

---

## Part Four: The Walker Who Walks

Let's try it from the other side. Maybe we can save the walker.

> *The walker don't walk—  
> The non-walker don't walk—  
> And who else is there?*⁵

Think about it:

- **The walker** is defined as "one who walks." But if he's *already* a walker, what's the "he walks" adding? He's done. The walking that made him a walker already happened.

- **The non-walker** don't walk. That's just what the word means. If he walked, he'd be a walker, not a non-walker.

- **Some third guy** who ain't a walker or non-walker? Show me where he's hiding.⁶

---

## Part Five: Which Came First?

Now here's the real trouble. The walker needs walking to be a walker. But walking needs a walker to happen. So which comes first?

> *Without walking, no walker.  
> Without walker, no walking.  
> So where's either one get started?*⁷

It's like asking which came first—the singer or the song? The father or the child? Each one needs the other to exist, but neither can go first.

They're leaning on each other with nothing holding them up.⁸

---

## Part Six: Where Does Walking Start?

Let me hit you with another one:

> *In the walked, you can't start walking—it's done.  
> In the not-walked, you can't start walking—it ain't begun.  
> In the being-walked... well, we just showed that falls apart.  
> So where does walking start?*⁹

You can't begin something in the past—it's over. You can't begin something in the future—it's not here. And you can't begin something in the present without the present turning into past the moment you try.

Walking ain't got nowhere to start.

---

## Part Seven: Standing Still

"Okay," someone says. "Forget walking. What about standing still?"

Same problem:

> *The goer don't stand still—  
> The non-goer don't stand still—  
> Who else is there to stand?*¹⁰

If you're a goer, you're defined by going. "He stands" takes away what made you a goer. But the non-goer—well, he wasn't going anyway, so what's he stopping?

And standing has the same problem as going. Standing needs a stander and stander needs standing. Same empty circle.¹¹

---

## Part Eight: Same or Different?

We're almost at the end. One last try:

> *Is the walker the same as the walking?  
> That don't work—you'd be saying the doer IS the deed.  
> Is the walker different from the walking?  
> That don't work neither—you'd have walking without a walker.*¹²

If they're identical, no difference between the kitchen and the cooking. But we know the cook ain't the meal.

If they're totally separate, you could find walking lying around somewhere without nobody doing it. But you never saw walking without a walker.

Not same, not different. So what are they?

---

## Part Nine: The Conclusion

After all this looking, after all this digging:

> *So the walking, the walker, and where he's going—  
> All three come up empty when you really look.*¹³

And Candrakīrti backs it up with scripture:

> *"Non-going is a term of attraction.  
> Going is a term of repulsion.  
> Where there is neither attraction nor repulsion—  
> That is the path of the noble ones."*¹⁴

---

## What This Means for Your Life

Now here's the Blues truth, friends.

You've been walking all your life. Walking toward something—success, love, peace, enlightenment. Walking away from something—pain, failure, your past.

And this chapter says: **look at the walking itself.**

Is there really a solid "you" doing the walking? We just showed the walker falls apart. Is there really a solid "destination"? It falls apart too. Is there really even "walking"? 

What you find is... this happening. Not-nothing, not-something. Dependent on a hundred conditions, claiming to be "my walk to my goal."

When you see that the walker has no solid core, and the destination has no solid existence, and the walking itself can't be pinned down—

You might just stop running.

Not give up. Not collapse. Just... stop the striving that comes from believing there's a solid self who has to get somewhere.

That's the peace the noble ones found. Not-going and not-not-going. Just... this.

---

## Endnotes

¹ **"Where you been ain't being walked"**: The Sanskrit uses three technical terms: *gata* (past/gone), *agata* (future/not-gone), *gamyamāna* (present/being-gone). The argument is that "present" can't be found apart from past and future.

² **"The opponent speaks up"**: This is probably a Sarvāstivādin Buddhist who believes all three times really exist. They say: "Activity is real, and it's located in the present space."

³ **"Double walking"**: The Sanskrit term is *dvi-gamana*—two goings. If "being-walked" already implies one walking, adding "is being walked" requires a second. But there's only one action happening.

⁴ **"You only got one pair of feet"**: Candrakīrti makes this point explicitly: double action requires double agent, but there's only one Devadatta walking.

⁵ **"Who else is there?"**: This is a trilemma—a three-way argument that covers all possibilities and finds none of them work.

⁶ **"Show me where he's hiding"**: The logic here is exhaustive: every entity is either X, not-X, or something other than both. Since "walker" and "non-walker" cover everything, there's no third option.

⁷ **"Which comes first?"**: This is *anyonyāśraya*—mutual dependence. Each term is defined by the other, but neither can exist first to ground the definition.

⁸ **"Nothing holding them up"**: This is the key insight: relations that seem solid are actually hanging in mid-air, each depending on the other with no foundation.

⁹ **"Walking ain't got nowhere to start"**: This applies to ALL activities, ALL beginnings. If beginning can't be found in past, present, or future—nothing really begins.

¹⁰ **"Standing still"**: Nāgārjuna shows that *sthiti* (standing/stopping) has the same structure as *gati* (motion). The same arguments that destroy one destroy the other.

¹¹ **"Same empty circle"**: The technical term is *prasaṅga*—showing the absurd consequences of the opponent's view.

¹² **"Same or different?"**: This is the identity-difference dilemma. It appears in many chapters and is never resolved—because there IS no third option, and yet the first two don't work.

¹³ **"All three come up empty"**: The formal conclusion: *gati* (motion), *gantṛ* (goer), and *gantavya* (destination) all lack *svabhāva* (inherent existence).

¹⁴ **"Neither attraction nor repulsion"**: This quote from the *Ākṣayamatinirdeśa-sūtra* shows that "non-going" isn't nihilism—it's the middle way between grasping and pushing away.

---

### Theological Notes

**For those who want the deep doctrine:**

Chapter 2 demonstrates that dependent origination applies even to motion—the most obvious and undeniable phenomenon. If motion, goer, and destination lack inherent nature, then *all* phenomena lack inherent nature.

The key method here is **temporal analysis**: past, present, and future are mutually defined and mutually exclusive. Nothing can be found that exists purely in one time-slice. This undermines the substantialist view that things have fixed, self-existing natures that persist through time.

**The connection to practice**: When you see that "I am walking toward my goal" falls apart on analysis, the grasping that drives it—the sense of a solid self with a solid destination—loosens. This isn't nihilism; it's freedom from the conceptual proliferation that causes suffering.

The Buddha walked for 45 years. But he wasn't walking like we walk—driven, grasping, believing in the solidity of walker and goal. He walked in the emptiness of walking.

# Chapter 3: Looking at Seeing
## *Can the Eye See What It's Doing?*

### Blues Vernacular Translation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening

*Now friends, this chapter is shorter than the last two, but don't let that fool you. Nāgārjuna's about to take apart something you use every minute of every day—your seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting, touching, and thinking. If these fall apart, what's left standing?*

---

## Part One: The Six Ways You Know the World

First, let's name what we're talking about:

1. **Seeing** — the eye and its business
2. **Hearing** — the ear and its business  
3. **Smelling** — the nose and its business
4. **Tasting** — the tongue and its business
5. **Touching** — the body and its business
6. **Thinking** — the mind and its business

The scriptures say these six are how you know the world. Forms, sounds, smells, tastes, textures, thoughts—these are what the six senses go after.¹

Fine. Let's look at one of them and see what we find.

---

## Part Two: Can Seeing See Itself?

Here's the first question:

> *That seeing—does it see itself?  
> No, it don't.  
> And if it can't see itself,  
> How's it gonna see anything else?*²

Think about it. Can your eye look at your eye—not in a mirror, but directly, the seeing looking at the seeing itself?

No. It's like asking a knife to cut itself.³ The blade can cut everything in the world except its own edge.

And here's the kicker: if seeing can't see itself, how do we know it's really "seeing" at all? Maybe it's more like a wall or a pillar—something that don't see nothing.⁴

---

## Part Three: What About Fire?

"Hold on," someone says. "Fire don't burn itself, but it sure burns other things. Maybe seeing is like that—it sees other things even though it can't see itself."

Nāgārjuna says: nice try, but no.

> *The fire example don't work.  
> Whatever you said about walking,  
> Same thing applies to burning.*⁵

Remember Chapter 2? The burned-thing ain't being burned. The not-yet-burned ain't being burned. And there's no "being-burned" apart from those two.

Same with the burner: the burner don't burn, and the non-burner don't burn.

So fire ain't got no solid self either. Can't use an empty example to prove something's solid.⁶

---

## Part Four: No Seeing, No Seer

If seeing falls apart, so does the seer:

> *What we said about seeing—  
> Same thing goes for the one who sees.*⁷

The seer needs seeing to be a seer. But we just showed seeing ain't solid. So the seer ain't solid neither.

And now watch the whole thing collapse:

> *No seer without seeing,  
> No seeing without seer,  
> No "thing seen" without both.  
> Which one you gonna start with?*⁸

They're all leaning on each other, and ain't none of them got legs.

---

## Part Five: What About Consciousness?

"But wait," someone pleads. "Even if we can't find a solid seer or seen, there's still consciousness. When the eye meets a form, consciousness arises. That proves something's happening!"

Nāgārjuna responds:

> *If there ain't no "seen" and no "seeing,"  
> Then the consciousness that's supposed to come from them,  
> And the contact, and the feeling, and the craving—  
> Where they gonna come from?*⁹

If the foundation is empty, what's built on it is empty too.

---

## Part Six: All the Senses Fall

And here's the final move:

> *What we said about seeing,  
> Same thing applies to hearing, smelling,  
> Tasting, touching, and thinking.  
> The hearer, the heard—all of it.*¹⁰

You can run this analysis on any sense:
- Can the ear hear itself hearing?
- Can the nose smell itself smelling?
- Can the mind think itself thinking?

Every time, you hit the same wall. The sense can't catch itself in the act. And without that, you can't prove it's really doing what you claim.¹¹

---

## What This Means for Your Life

Now here's where the Blues comes in, friend.

All day long, you're trusting your eyes, your ears, your thoughts. "I saw it with my own eyes!" "I heard what they said!" "I know what I think!"

And Nāgārjuna says: look at the looking itself. What you find is... no solid looker, no solid looking, no solid thing looked at. Three emptinesses leaning on each other, and we call it "experience."

This ain't saying you're not experiencing. Things are happening. But the way you *think* it works—a solid ME seeing a solid WORLD—that ain't how it is.

When you see this, something relaxes. You stop trusting your senses as the last word on reality. You stop saying "I know what I saw" like it's the end of the conversation.

The Buddha said:

> *"The eye don't see forms.  
> The mind don't know things.  
> This is the highest truth—  
> And the world don't enter it."*¹²

That ain't nihilism. That's freedom from being trapped by what you think you know.

---

## Endnotes

¹ **"The six ways you know the world"**: These are the *ṣaḍ-āyatana*, the six sense-bases. In Buddhist psychology, ALL experience comes through one of these six doors.

² **"Can seeing see itself?"**: This is the problem of self-reflexivity. Can the eye be both the seer AND the seen at the same time? Nāgārjuna says no.

³ **"Like asking a knife to cut itself"**: Candrakīrti uses this analogy (*svātmani kriyā-virodha*—contradiction of action upon itself). Other examples: a fingertip can't touch itself; a scale can't weigh itself.

⁴ **"Like a wall or a pillar"**: If seeing can't prove it's seeing by seeing itself, it hasn't established that it sees at all. It might be like a non-seeing thing.

⁵ **"Whatever you said about walking"**: The Chapter 2 arguments apply to all activities—walking, burning, seeing, hearing. The structure is identical.

⁶ **"Can't use an empty example to prove something's solid"**: The fire analogy fails because fire itself, when analyzed, has no inherent nature. You can't use one empty thing to establish another.

⁷ **"Same thing goes for the one who sees"**: The *draṣṭṛ* (seer) is refuted the same way as *darśana* (seeing). They're two words for one empty relationship.

⁸ **"Which one you gonna start with?"**: This is *anyonyāśraya*—mutual dependence. Seer needs seeing, seeing needs seer, both need the seen, the seen needs them. Circular, with no foundation.

⁹ **"Where they gonna come from?"**: If the sense-base is unfounded, the whole chain of dependent origination (consciousness → contact → feeling → craving → grasping) has no ground.

¹⁰ **"Same thing applies to hearing..."**: This is *atideśa*—extension by analogy. Nāgārjuna doesn't repeat all the arguments for each sense; he says "apply it yourself."

¹¹ **"The sense can't catch itself in the act"**: This is the core problem of immediate experience. We can't step outside experience to verify it's happening the way we think.

¹² **"The eye don't see forms"**: This quotation appears in the *Lalitavistara* and other sutras. It doesn't mean nothing happens—it means the way we conceptualize seeing (solid eye seeing solid forms) is not the ultimate truth.

---

### Theological Notes

**For those who want the deep doctrine:**

Chapter 3 applies the Chapter 2 analysis to sensation itself. This is significant because sensation is the most "immediate" form of experience—it seems undeniable. "I'm seeing this right now!" But Nāgārjuna shows that the structure of seer-seeing-seen has the same problem as goer-going-gone.

The key move is **self-reflexivity**: if seeing can see, it should be able to see itself. But it can't. This doesn't mean seeing doesn't happen—it means seeing has no *svabhāva*, no independent, self-standing nature.

This has profound implications for meditation practice. When you look at the mind looking, you find nothing solid. This is **vipaśyanā**—insight meditation. Not creating emptiness, but *seeing* the emptiness that was always there.

The Buddha's statement that "the eye does not see forms" is not a denial of conventional experience. It's a statement about ultimate truth (*paramārtha*). Conventionally, of course we see. Ultimately, none of the three elements (seer, seeing, seen) can be found with inherent existence.

# Chapter 4: Looking at What You're Made Of
## *The Five Heaps That Ain't Really There*

### Blues Vernacular Translation by Master John Kim

---

## Opening

*Friends, we've been looking at conditions, at motion, at the senses. Now Nāgārjuna goes after something even closer to home—the five "heaps" that supposedly make up YOU. Form, feeling, perception, formations, consciousness. If these ain't solid, what's left of the self you thought you were?*

---

## Part One: What's a "Heap" Anyway?

Buddhist teaching says there's five things that make up your experience:

1. **Form** (*rūpa*) — your body, your senses, the stuff you touch
2. **Feeling** (*vedanā*) — pleasant, unpleasant, neither  
3. **Perception** (*saṃjñā*) — recognizing "this is a tree," "that's my friend"
4. **Formations** (*saṃskārā*) — intentions, habits, mental patterns
5. **Consciousness** (*vijñāna*) — the basic awareness behind it all

They call these "heaps" or "aggregates" because they're piled together, making what you call "me."

But are they solid? Let's look at form.¹

---

## Part Two: Form and Its Cause

Nāgārjuna asks a simple question:

> *You can't find form apart from its cause.  
> You can't find the cause apart from form.  
> So which one is really there?*²

"Form" means the physical stuff—your body, the colors you see, the sounds you hear. The "cause of form" is the four elements: earth (hardness), water (fluidity), fire (heat), wind (motion).

Try to find the form without the elements. Can't do it.  
Try to find the elements without the form they make. Can't do it.

They're stuck together. Neither one stands on its own.³

---

## Part Three: The Trap of "No Cause"

"Fine," someone says. "Maybe form exists on its own, without needing a cause."

> *If form could exist without a cause,  
> It would be causeless.  
> But ain't nothing in this world  
> That got no cause at all.*⁴

Even a mirage needs something to make it appear. Even a dream needs a dreamer. If you say form just IS, with no dependence on anything—well, that's magic talk. And this philosophy don't do magic.⁵

---

## Part Four: The Trap of "No Effect"

Now flip it around:

> *If the cause could exist without the form,  
> It would be a cause of nothing.  
> But there ain't no cause  
> That don't cause something.*⁶

Think about it. What makes something a "cause"? Having an effect. The word "cause" *means* "that which produces something."

No effect, no cause. The title's empty.⁷

---

## Part Five: The Existent-Nonexistent Trap

Here's the dilemma you can't escape:

> *If form already exists, why's it need a cause?  
> If form don't exist, what's the cause causing?*⁸

Same argument from Chapter 1. If the flower's already bloomed, what's the seed doing? If there ain't no flower yet, what's the seed the seed *of*?

Causation slips through the cracks either way.⁹

---

## Part Six: What About Everything Else?

Now here's where it gets real:

> *Whatever we said about form—  
> Same thing goes for feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness.  
> Same thing goes for everything.*¹⁰

Feeling arises from contact—but contact has no substance.  
Perception arises with consciousness—but consciousness is empty too.  
Formations arise from ignorance—but ignorance has no solid core.  
Consciousness arises from formations—which we just said ain't there.

The whole wheel of becoming, when you really look at it, is spinning on nothing.¹¹

---

## Part Seven: The Unbeatable Defense

Somebody might try to argue back: "Okay, form might be empty, but feeling's gotta be real. I *feel* things!"

Nāgārjuna says: nice try.

> *Any objection you make against emptiness  
> Is itself empty.  
> You can't beat emptiness  
> By pointing at something else that's also empty.*¹²

This is the genius of the Mādhyamaka. Every counter-example you offer? It's subject to the same analysis. Feeling? Empty. Perception? Empty. Your objection itself? Empty.

There ain't nowhere to stand that ain't already been deconstructed.¹³

---

## What This Means for Your Life

Now here's the Blues truth, friend.

Your whole life, you've been identifying with these heaps. "I am my body." "I am my feelings." "I am my thoughts." "I am my consciousness."

Nāgārjuna says: look at them. Really look.

Your body needs causes—food, air, the elements. Without them, no body. And those causes need causes. And so on.

Your feelings arise from contact, which arises from senses, which arise from... the whole chain goes back with nothing solid at the root.

When you see this—really see it—something extraordinary happens. The grip loosens. The death-grip you've had on "me and mine" starts to relax.

Not because "you" disappear. But because the solid, isolated, independent "you" was never there to begin with. What's here is a flow, a dance, a dependent arising of heaps that don't belong to anyone.

And that? That's liberation.

As the Buddha said:

> *"The emptiness of one thing  
> Is the emptiness of all things.  
> Understand one, understand all."*¹⁴

---

## Endnotes

¹ **"The five heaps"**: *Pañca-skandha* in Sanskrit. This is the core Buddhist analysis of personal experience. There is no "self" (*ātman*) apart from these five; but Nāgārjuna shows that these five are also empty.

² **"You can't find form apart from its cause"**: This is *anyonyāśraya*—mutual dependence. Cause and effect need each other to be what they are.

³ **"Neither one stands on its own"**: This is the Mādhyamaka point: things exist *dependently*, not *independently*. Dependence is not non-existence; it's non-inherent-existence.

⁴ **"Ain't nothing that got no cause"**: Even in conventional terms, we don't accept magic—things popping into existence from nothing. Buddhism rejects *āhetuka-vāda* (the doctrine of no-cause).

⁵ **"This philosophy don't do magic"**: The Cārvāka/Lokāyata school held that there's no law of causation. Buddhism explicitly rejects this.

⁶ **"A cause of nothing"**: *Akāryaka-kāraṇa*—cause without effect. A contradiction. 

⁷ **"The title's empty"**: "Cause" is a relational term. Without the relation (to an effect), the designation doesn't apply.

⁸ **"What's the cause causing?"**: This is the same dilemma as MMK 1.8. Causation of existent things is redundant; causation of non-existent things is impossible.

⁹ **"Slips through the cracks"**: The logic leaves no room for inherent causation. What functions is *conventional* causation—dependently designated, not independently real.

¹⁰ **"Same thing goes for everything"**: *Atideśa*—extension. Nāgārjuna doesn't need to repeat the arguments for each aggregate; he says "apply it yourself."

¹¹ **"Spinning on nothing"**: The twelve links of dependent origination (*pratītyasamutpāda*) are all empty. This doesn't mean they don't function—it means they have no independent core.

¹² **"Itself empty"**: This is the *sādhya-sama* fallacy ("equal to the thesis"). Your counter-example needs the same proof as what you're objecting to.

¹³ **"Nowhere to stand"**: This is why Mādhyamaka is called "the philosophy with no thesis." Every position is deconstructed—including this one.

¹⁴ **"Understand one, understand all"**: This is a fundamental Mādhyamaka principle. Emptiness is universal. Once you see any one thing is empty, you've seen the emptiness of all things.

---

### Theological Notes

**For those who want the deep doctrine:**

Chapter 4 targets the *skandhas* directly—the building blocks of personal identity in Buddhist psychology. If these are empty, so is the "person" (*pudgala*) they supposedly constitute.

This is crucial for practice. The meditator who analyzes form, feeling, perception, formations, and consciousness—looking for the "I"—finds nothing. This is *anātman* (non-self). But Nāgārjuna goes further: the skandhas themselves don't have inherent nature. It's not just that there's no self *beyond* the skandhas; the skandhas *themselves* are dependently arisen, empty of essence.

The practical upshot: you don't need to *destroy* the skandhas (impossible), or *transcend* them (to where?). You just need to *see* them correctly—as empty flows, not solid blocks. That seeing IS liberation.

# Chapter 5: What They Call "Space" (The Elements Blues)

## The Trouble

When the ground itself won't hold still, a soul starts lookin' for somethin' solid. You reach for earth, water, fire, air… and when even they slip through your fingers, you point to the sky itself. You say, "Well, there's *space*—ain't nothin' more empty and true than that." 

But brother, that's when the real lonesome sets in. Clingin' to the very air around you, tryin' to make a home out of a ghost. The trouble is believin' any damn thing—even nothin'—has a fixed address in this world.

---

## Verse 5.1: Can't Point to the Nowhere

**The Teaching:**
Well, they talk about that ol' empty Space,
Say it's the first thing in this sorry place.
But if you look for what makes Space be *Space*,
You find your finger pointin' at your own face.

You can't show me the "empty" 'fore the empty appears,
Just a long, quiet howlin' in your ears.

**What It Means:**
You can't define "space" by pointing to its characteristics (like "emptiness") unless space already exists. But if it doesn't exist yet, there's nothing to attach those characteristics to. The whole idea falls apart before you even start.

---

## Verse 5.2: The Unmarked Blues

**The Teaching:**
Now if Space showed up *before* its brand,
You'd have a nowhere, stretchin' 'cross the land.
A thing with no mark, not a single scar,
A stranger to what it even *is*—now that's bizarre.

An unmarked Space is a king with no crown,
Just a dusty old robe draggin' on the ground.

**What It Means:**
If space existed inherently *before* its defining characteristic ("emptiness"), it would be a featureless, indeterminate nothing. But that's not the "space" we talk about. A thing without any defining traits is a logical phantom.

---

## Verse 5.3: Everybody's Got a Mark to Bear

**The Teaching:**
And listen here, child, to this ol' truth I found:
Ain't a thing walkin' this earth, on or under the ground,
That don't carry some mark, some stain, some sign,
That says what it is in this tangled-up design.

If it's got no mark, it ain't even a ghost—
It's the imaginary friend you forgot to boast.

**What It Means:**
Nothing can exist as a determinate object without *some* defining characteristic. A completely characterless entity isn't an entity at all—it's a concept that collapses under its own weight.

---

## Verse 5.4: The Mark Can't Find a Home

**The Teaching:**
So where's the mark gonna land, tell me true?
On somethin' already marked? That won't do!
On somethin' unmarked? Well, there ain't such a thing.
The mark's got nowhere to roost, nowhere to sing.

It's a key with no lock, a song with no throat,
A river runnin' dry in an old, empty boat.

**What It Means:**
The characteristic can't apply to something already characterized (redundant) or to something uncharacterized (impossible). This creates a fundamental incoherence in the very idea of "defining" anything with intrinsic nature.

---

## Verse 5.5: Caught in the Dance

**The Teaching:**
So neither the mark nor the marked can stand,
They're leanin' on each other, hand in hand.
Can't find the *thing*—well, the mark falls too,
They're dancin' in circles with nothin' to do.

Like two broke gamblers bettin' with air,
Each one pointin' to the other who ain't there.

**What It Means:**
The characteristic and the characterized are mutually dependent. If one falls, the other falls. Neither has independent, intrinsic existence. They're empty—all the way down.

---

## Verse 5.6: Neither Same Nor Different

**The Teaching:**
Is the mark the *same* as the thing it brands?
Well, that don't make sense—one's already in hand.
Is it *different*? Then how do they ever meet?
Like two strangers passin' on opposite streets.

Not same, not different, not here, not gone,
Space is a riddle that keeps singin' its song.

**What It Means:**
If the characteristic and characterized were identical, defining would be meaningless. If utterly different, they couldn't relate. Both logical options fail. This is the tetralemma at work.

---

## Verse 5.7: Clingin' to "Exists" Don't Lead to Peace

**The Teaching:**
Now some folks holler, "It exists! It's real!"
They point to the sky like they're closin' a deal.
But that clingin' to "is"—it's a chain on your soul,
It keeps you from findin' the peace that makes whole.

The more you grab at the solid and true,
The further that freedom gets from you.

**What It Means:**
Those who cling to the inherent existence of things—even abstract things like space—remain trapped in a view that obstructs liberation. Peace (*śānti*) comes from releasing the grip on fixed existence.

---

## Verse 5.8: The Whole Show's Like This

**The Teaching:**
And it ain't just Space, no, this old, tired tune,
It's the cause and the effect, under the sun and the moon.
It's the feelin' you feel, the fire and the wood,
The whole world's understood like this, and it's good.

Elements, aggregates, the whole creation spin,
Empty all the way down, and empty within.

**What It Means:**
This analysis isn't just about space or physical elements. It applies to *all* phenomena—cause and effect, sensations, the components of a person, everything. All are devoid of intrinsic, independent reality. This is the universal truth of emptiness.

---

## The Liberation

So you stop lookin' for the solid ground in the dirt, or the water, or the air, or even in the big, empty sky. You see the world not as a collection of fixed things, but as a shimmerin' dance of dependently-arisin' appearances. 

The weight lifts. You ain't gotta carry the universe on your back no more, 'cause you finally see it ain't made of stone. It's made of relationship. And in that seein', even the blues got room to breathe, and the chain of one solid thing causin' another solid thing just… falls away. 

You're free in the middle of the whole, beautiful, empty show.

## Theological Notes

# Chapter 6: Desire and the One Who Wants (The Longing Blues)

## The Trouble

You walk around thinkin' you *are* that hurtin' in your heart, that you *own* that ache. Or you try to run from it, say it ain't got nothin' to do with the real you. Both them roads lead to the same lonesome crossroads at midnight. You chasin' a shadow, or you bein' chased by one.

This chapter asks the hardest question the Blues can ask: Who is the one who wants? Is the desire *you*, or is it somethin' that happens *to* you? And Nāgārjuna shows us—both answers miss the mark.

---

## Verse 6.1: The Man Before the Ache

**The Teaching:**
If the *man with the empty heart* was here before the *longin'* came...
Well, who would that man be? A ghost with no story, a dry river with no name.
But that can't be right. No, sir. The longin' defines the man.

**What It Means:**
If the desirous one existed independently before desire arose, then desire would have no basis or support. But a "desirous one" without desire is a meaningless concept—like calling a singer "a singer" who never sang a note.

---

## Verse 6.2: The Ache Before the Man

**The Teaching:**
Now, if the *longin'* showed up first, all dressed in pain and blue...
Tell me, whose house would it walk into? Who'd be there to feel it through?
A want without a wanter just whistles down a vacant street.

**What It Means:**
If desire existed independently before a desirous person, to whom would it belong? Desire can't stand alone—it needs someone to feel it. An ache with no heart to ache in is just silence.

---

## Verse 6.3: Together from the Start?

**The Teaching:**
They can't show up together, holdin' hands, sayin' "we begin as one."
And they can't live apart, their separate lives on the run.
Look close: you can't find where one starts and the other one is done.

**What It Means:**
Desire and the desirous cannot arise simultaneously, defining each other in a circle. Nor can they arise independently. Their apparent existence is co-dependent, with no fixed starting point—like two dancers who need each other to dance but can't say who led first.

---

## Verse 6.4: Same or Different?

**The Teaching:**
Ain't the *same*—the fire ain't the burn. 
Ain't *different*—you can't have the burn without the flame.
You try to pin down this misery, give the blues a separate name...
But the singer and the song are tangled in the very same game.

**What It Means:**
Desire is not identical to the desirous person (for then who would feel the desire?). Nor is it utterly different (for then they'd have no connection). Both logical options fail when you look close.

---

## Verse 6.5: If They Were the Same

**The Teaching:**
If the ache *was* the acher, who'd be left to feel the pain?
You'd have a hurt with nobody home, a thunderclap with no rain.
The one who longs would disappear into the longin' like a match into the flame.

**What It Means:**
If desire and the desirous one were identical, the distinction between having an emotion and being an emotion collapses. There'd be no "you" to experience the wanting—just wanting, floating free with no witness.

---

## Verse 6.6: If They Were Different

**The Teaching:**
But if they're strangers to each other, passin' ships in the night,
Then where's the connection? How does the want find the wanter right?
You'd have a lover and a love that never met, never touched, never held tight.

**What It Means:**
If truly different, desire and the desirous one would be utterly unrelated—like two strangers on opposite ends of town. But we never see desire free-floating without someone who desires.

---

## Verse 6.7: The Logical Trap

**The Teaching:**
So if they're different, the wanter could be... free of want?
A blues man with no blues? That's the lie the mind'll flaunt.
You can't have the designation without the very thing it names—
A "lover" without loving is just a word playin' games.

**What It Means:**
If difference were real, you could have a "desirous one" who has no desire—which contradicts the very definition. The label requires the quality. Pull one out, and the other collapses.

---

## Verse 6.8: Neither Works

**The Teaching:**
Neither same nor different, neither here nor there,
The longin' and the one who longs just hang suspended in the air.
You can't grab hold of either one—they're made of thinner stuff than prayer.

**What It Means:**
Both identity and difference are conceptual imputations, not features of reality. We *think* in these terms, but the thinking doesn't match what's actually there. The relation is empty.

---

## Verse 6.9: Like a Dream's Two Sides

**The Teaching:**
The wanter and the want are like the dreamer and the dream,
The seer and the seen, the river and the stream.
Neither one exists alone—they lean on each other's seam.
And when you finally see that lean... you wake up from the scheme.

**What It Means:**
Desire and the desirous one are like the apprehended and the apprehender—mutually defining, mutually empty. Neither can be found without the other. This isn't a problem to solve; it's a truth to see.

---

## Verse 6.10: The Whole Show's Like This

**The Teaching:**
And it ain't just the longin', this old familiar friend.
It's the *rage* and the *confusion*, and the heart that won't mend.
The hater and the hatred, the fool and the foolish mind...
All just empty echoes, leavin' not a trace behind.

You can't clean a mirror with a dusty, dirty rag.
See the emptiness in the feelin', and the one holdin' the bag.

**What It Means:**
This analysis applies to all afflictive states (*kleśa*)—hatred (*dveṣa*) and delusion (*moha*) along with desire (*rāga*). The one who is angry and the anger itself are likewise empty of intrinsic existence. Purification comes from seeing this, not from battling solid enemies.

---

## The Liberation

The freedom ain't in killin' the desire. It ain't in drownin' in it, either. It's in seein' the whole sad, beautiful dance for what it is: a dance. 

The longin' comes, it sings its verse. You don't have to build it a home, or wear it like a crown, or let it name you. You can let it move on through, like a train whistle in the distance. 

You are the wide, open sky that hears the sound. You were never the prisoner of that whistle. You were always the night.

---

## Theological Notes

| Term | Sanskrit | The Blues Reading |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **Rāga** | राग | The passion, the desire, the itch, the *Blues* itself. The specific ache for something to be other than it is. |
| **Rakta** | रक्त | The one stained by that passion, the "desirous one." The Bluesman, the lover, the sufferer—the one who seems to *have* the Blues. |
| **Kleśa** | क्लेश | The afflictions—desire, hatred, delusion. The three poisons that keep the wheel spinning. |
| **Dveṣa** | द्वेष | Hatred, aversion. The push-away. The anger that burns. |
| **Moha** | मोह | Delusion, ignorance. The fog that keeps you lost at the crossroads. |
| **The Point** | — | Nāgārjuna uses this intimate pair to demonstrate *pratītyasamutpāda* (dependent arising) and *śūnyatā* (emptiness). We search for a solid "self" who desires, or a solid "emotion" called desire. He shows both are empty of independent existence. They arise only in mutual dependence. Seeing this ends the futile war of either clinging to or suppressing desire. The path is liberation *from* the illusion of solidity, not *from* the fleeting, dream-like phenomena themselves. |
# Chapter 7: Born, Stayin', Gone (The Conditioned Blues)

## The Trouble

You get to thinkin' life's a solid song. A clear start when you're born, a long middle while you're here, a sure end when you're gone. You believe in the comin' up, the hangin' on, and the passin' away like they're three stations on a railroad track. 

But, Lord, that track's a mirage. You go to grab the "beginning," it's already slippin' into "stayin'." You try to hold the "stayin'," it's already fadin' into "gone." And that "gone"? It ain't nothin' but the ghost of what never truly was. Clingin' to that trio is the root of all the lonesome, low-down heartache.

---

## Group 1 (Verses 7.1-7.4): The Problem of Arising

### Verse 7.1: Where Does "Comin' Into Being" Come From?

**The Teaching:**
If "comin' into being" was a real thing, by itself,
It'd have to show up in one of three ways:
From what's already here, from what ain't here at all,
Or from what's both here and gone.
But look close, now. All three roads lead to a muddy ditch.

**What It Means:**
If arising is a real, substantial thing, it must itself arise. But from what? The analysis shows all options fail.

---

### Verse 7.2: Already Here?

**The Teaching:**
Say it comes from what's *already here*.
Then what's "comin' into being"? It's already arrived!
That's like sayin' you're "born" again when you're already sittin' on the porch.
Ain't no new birth, just the same old tired man.

**What It Means:**
An existent thing can't "arise"—it's already there. Arising of what's already arisen is meaningless.

---

### Verse 7.3: From Nothing?

**The Teaching:**
And it can't come from what's *not here*.
That's like wishin' a child from a barren stone.
You can't get somethin' from nothin', nohow.
Where would it even start from? There's no ground for the seed.

**What It Means:**
You can't derive something from sheer non-existence. There's no basis, no cause, no ground.

---

### Verse 7.4: Both?

**The Teaching:**
And "both here and not here"? That's just two wrongs.
You mix a lie with a lie, you get a bigger lie.
So if it don't come from itself, from other, or from both...
Tell me, friend, just where does this "arising" call home?

**What It Means:**
Combining the flaws of both options doesn't solve the problem. The very concept of intrinsic arising has nowhere to stand.

---

## Group 2 (Verses 7.5-7.12): Duration and Cessation

### Verse 7.5: What Lasts?

**The Teaching:**
"Lastin'"—what we call stayin' a while—
Depends on this phantom "arising."
But if a thing never truly *got here*,
What in the world is there to "last"?
You can't prolong a shadow.

**What It Means:**
Duration presupposes something that arose. If arising is unfindable, so is duration.

---

### Verse 7.6: Duration of Duration?

**The Teaching:**
And if "lastin'" lasts, then what makes *that* last?
You'd need a lastin' of the lastin',
And a lastin' of that lastin' too.
The regress goes on like a blues song that won't end.

**What It Means:**
If duration is a real dharma, it needs its own duration—infinite regress.

---

### Verse 7.7-7.8: Cessation's Blues

**The Teaching:**
And "ceasin'"—the passin' away—
Also leans on this same "arising."
If a thing wasn't truly established,
How can it be said to "stop"?
And if cessation ceases... what stops *that* stoppin'?

**What It Means:**
Cessation faces identical problems. A stop that itself stops requires another stop, endlessly.

---

### Verses 7.9-7.12: The Three Can't Prop Each Other Up

**The Teaching:**
Maybe arisin' gives rise to lastin',
And lastin' holds up the ceasin',
And ceasin' circles back to arisin'?
But that's just three ghosts holdin' hands in the dark,
Pretendin' each one's more solid than the others.
Ain't none of 'em got a leg to stand on.

**What It Means:**
The three marks can't serve as foundations for each other. Mutually dependent, all are empty.

---

## Group 3 (Verses 7.13-7.19): The Three Marks Tangled Up

### The Teaching (Summary):

They say everything "conditioned" has these three stamps:
Born, stayin', gone.
But if the thing that's *supposed* to wear these stamps
Is never found in the first place,
Who's wearin' the tattoos?
You got three labels and nothin' to stick 'em on.

**What It Means:**
If the characterized (the conditioned thing) can't be established, neither can its characteristics. The relationship between mark and marked collapses.

---

## Group 4 (Verses 7.20-7.28): Being and Non-Being

### Verse 7.20: The Universal Negation

**The Teaching:**
Neither from what *is*, nor from what *ain't*,
Neither from *both* nor from *neither*,
Does anything ever truly come to be,
From anything, belonging to anyone, anywhere.

**What It Means:**
This is the tetralemma applied universally. All four logical possibilities for intrinsic arising are refuted. Not nihilism—just clarity about what "arising" can't mean.

---

### Verses 7.21-7.28: Every Option Fails

**The Teaching:**
You say it comes from what exists? It's already here.
From what don't exist? There's nothin' to come from.
From both? You're stacking contradictions.
From neither? That's just silence pretendin' to be an answer.

Every road you walk down leads back to this crossroads:
"Arising" ain't what you thought it was.
It's not a solid bridge from nowhere to somewhere.
It's just a word we use to point at the flow.

**What It Means:**
Each verse systematically closes off an escape route. The opponent's reified "arising" cannot survive analysis.

---

## Group 5 (Verses 7.29-7.34): Like a Dream

### Verse 7.29: The Great Comparison

**The Teaching:**
So what is this world of "born, stayin', gone"?
It's like a magic show—you see the trick, but there ain't no rabbit.
It's like a dream—you walk through walls, but wake up in your bed.
It's like a city in the desert sky—shimmerin' there, but ain't no streets to walk.

**What It Means:**
The similes are not poetic decoration. They're precise: illusions appear but mislead; dreams are experienced but insubstantial; mirages exist visually but can't be touched.

---

### Verse 7.30-7.31: Not Nothing

**The Teaching:**
But don't go thinkin' this means nothin's here!
The show is still playin'. The dream still unfolds.
It's just that the solidity you once believed in
Was never there in the first place.
The weight lifts—not 'cause the world disappeared,
But 'cause you stopped carryin' what was never real.

**What It Means:**
This isn't nihilism. Conventional appearance continues. What's negated is the reification—the belief that things exist "from their own side."

---

### Verse 7.32: The Teaching Is a Finger

**The Teaching:**
And even this teachin' about "no arisin'"
And these "three marks" that ain't solid marks—
Is just a finger pointin' at the moon.
It's a raft to cross the river of confusion.
Don't mistake the map for the territory.

**What It Means:**
The Mādhyamaka analysis is itself conventional. It's a tool, not an absolute doctrine to cling to.

---

### Verses 7.33-7.34: Freedom in the Flow

**The Teaching:**
For one who knows this deep in their bones,
The dust of sorrow don't cling.
The mind becomes clear, undisturbed,
Like still water after the storm.

No "arising" to chase, no "lasting" to hold, no "ceasing" to fear.
Seein' this, the heart finds its rest
Right in the middle of the comin' and goin'.
The Blues is still played, but the player is free.

**What It Means:**
Liberation is not escape from the conditioned world. It's seeing through the reification of "conditioned" into solid, graspable processes. In that seeing, peace.

---

## The Liberation

So you let go of the need for the song to have a solid start. You release the grip on makin' the groove last forever. You quit dreadin' the final chord. When "born, stayin', gone" lose their absolute weight, the whole world becomes a dance of dependently arisen notes. 

You pick up the guitar not to build a permanent monument, but to join the ever-flowin', empty, luminous river of sound. You play the Conditioned Blues, but you ain't conditioned by it. That, my friend, is the liberation of the open road. The freedom in the very flow you once feared.

---

## Theological Notes

| Term | Sanskrit | The Blues Reading |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **Saṃskṛta** | संस्कृत | The conditioned—everything that comes and goes, arises and passes. The very fabric of the Blues world. |
| **Utpāda** | उत्पाद | Arising—the moment you pick up the guitar, the moment the heartache starts. |
| **Sthiti** | स्थिति | Duration—the middle of the song, the long stretch of longing. |
| **Nirodha** | निरोध | Cessation—the last note, the end of the night, the passing of the pain. |
| **Māyā** | माया | Illusion—the magic trick that looks real but ain't. |
| **Svapna** | स्वप्न | Dream—the journey that feels so solid till you wake. |
| **Gandharva-nagara** | गन्धर्वनगर | Mirage—the city in the sky you can see but never reach. |

**The Blues Insight:**
- The Blues "arises" when you pick up the guitar... but did the Blues exist before? It was in the ache, in the history, in the silence. It didn't *come from* anywhere. It co-arose with the need, the hand, the string.
- The song "lasts" while you play... but each moment is already gone. The "duration" is just a label for a string of dyin' notes. You can't find the "song" in any single one.
- The song "ends"... but it echoes on in the listener's ear, and you can play it again tomorrow. The "cessation" is just a change in the pattern, not a jump into nothin'.
- The conditioned nature of life *is* the Blues—the constant, bittersweet flow. But seein' through it, seein' its empty, dream-like nature, is liberation.
# Chapter 8: The Doer and the Doin' (Action Blues)

## The Trouble

Well now, sit down right here. Got a question that's been doggin' me since I first picked up this old guitar. See, folks talk about the *singer* and the *song*. The *player* and the *playin'*. They say, "That man *is* the blues." 

But when the last note fades… where'd he go? You start lookin' for the "doer" apart from the "doin'," you find nothin' but an empty stage and a hollow-body echo. That's the trouble. We're all singin' the "I" song, but the melody's got no stand-alone singer.

---

## Verse 8.1: Definitions

**The Teaching:**
They call me a player 'cause I play these strings.
They call it playin' 'cause I'm the one who sings.
You can't pull 'em apart, no matter how you try—
Like the whisperin' wind and the moanin' sky.

**What It Means:**
Agent is defined by action; action is defined by agent. Each needs the other for its very meaning. Conventional definitions work—but can we find them independently?

---

## Verse 8.2: Doer First?

**The Teaching:**
If the doin' comes first, before the doer's found,
Then who's that doin'? On what ground?
But if the doer stands alone, complete,
Without the doin' at his feet…
Then what's he *doin'* in this heat?

**What It Means:**
If the agent exists before acting—it's "agentless" in that moment. What makes it an agent if it's not doing anything?

---

## Verse 8.3: Action First?

**The Teaching:**
Now flip it 'round—the action came before?
Well, who was runnin' when there wasn't no one at the door?
Walkin' with no walker, singin' with no throat,
That's just a ghost hummin' a busted note.

**What It Means:**
Action without an agent is incoherent. "Walking" needs a walker. "Playing" needs a player.

---

## Verses 8.4-8.5: Can't Stand Alone

**The Teaching:**
You can't have action standin' free like a tumbleweed.
And the doer without doin'? That's just a man in need.
They lean on each other like two crutches in the rain,
Neither one can walk alone without the other's pain.

**What It Means:**
Neither agent nor action can exist independently. They require each other for their very identity. Mutual dependence is the only structure that works.

---

## Verses 8.6-8.7: Same or Different?

**The Teaching:**
Well, are they the same? The fire ain't the burn.
Are they different? Then how do they take turns?
If the singer and the song are one and the same thing,
Then the bell *is* the ring, and the sting *is* the sting.
But if they're strangers to each other, passin' on the way,
How does the do-er meet the deed on any given day?

**What It Means:**
Identity collapses the distinction—there'd be no difference between doer and deed. Difference severs the connection—they'd be utterly unrelated. Both options fail.

---

## Verse 8.8: Neither Works

**The Teaching:**
So it ain't through "same" that they get along,
And it ain't through "different" neither, my song.
Not both, not neither—can't find no firm ground.
Just the echo of a question that keeps goin' 'round.

**What It Means:**
The tetralemma applied. Neither identity, nor difference, nor both, nor neither establishes a fixed relationship. What remains is dependence, not substance.

---

## Verse 8.9: The Whole Chain

**The Teaching:**
And if you ask about the *fruit* of what we do—
The karmic bill that comes due—
It's the same story, friend, same lonesome tune:
Can't find the harvest without the planter in the room.

**What It Means:**
Cause and effect—agent, action, fruit—are all caught in the same web of mutual dependence.

---

## Verses 8.10-8.11: Time Won't Help

**The Teaching:**
You say "first comes the cause, then the effect"?
Or "they show up together, intersect"?
Neither road takes you to solid land.
Time don't make nothin' permanent, understand?

The feelin' you feel, the experiencer too—
They lean the same way this whole chapter's been true.
The witness ain't separate from what's seen.
This "doer" is nothin' but a heart yearnin' back at the dream.

**What It Means:**
Temporal sequence doesn't save inherent existence. Even the experiencer (witness) of actions is dependently arisen.

---

## Verse 8.12: The Universal Truth

**The Teaching:**
So when you see the doer and the deed are hollow through,
You see *everything* that way—that's the liberation view.
Not just this action, not just this tired hand,
But the whole world's foundation is built on empty sand.

And that ain't bad news—no, listen here—
Empty means flexible, means there's nothin' to fear.
The karma keeps rollin', but nobody's trapped,
'Cause the one you thought was *you* was always just adapt.

**What It Means:**
The emptiness of agent and action extends to all phenomena. This doesn't destroy moral responsibility—it frees it from reification. Karma works *because* things are empty, not despite it.

---

## The Liberation

So here's the turnaround, the break in the clouds. You see the doer and the doin' ain't solid—they're just *dependently arisen*. Like the sound and the strummin'. You can't find the singer, but the song sure gets sung. 

That's the freedom. You stop grabbin' at ghosts. You stop claimin' a "me" that owns the joy and the pain. You just let the music move through—the cryin', the laughin', the playin'. You become the empty space where the blues can happen. No owner. No permanent performer. Just the raw, dependently-arisen, empty *performance*. 

And in that, there's a peace deeper than the deepest 12-bar groove.

---

## Theological Notes

| Term | Sanskrit | The Blues Reading |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **Kāraka** | कारक | The doer, the agent—the guitarist, the singer, the one holdin' the harp. |
| **Karma** | कर्म | The deed, the action—the playin', the singin', the cryin' out loud. |
| **Kārya** | कार्य | The effect, the fruit—the impact the song has, the karma that comes due. |
| **Saṃsāra** | संसार | The endless loop—the juke joint of rebirth, the same old song on repeat. |

**The Two Truths on the Bandstand:**
On the *conventional* stage, yeah, there's a singer and a song. We use the words. We point the finger. But under the *ultimate* spotlight, you can't isolate nothin'. The agent is empty of inherent existence (*śūnya*). So is the action. They lean on each other like two drunks holdin' each other up, pretendin' to be a solid wall.

**No Soloist, Just the Jam:**
This ain't nihilism. The music *happens*. Causation *happens*. But it's a web, not a line. It's the whole band—the intention (the itch to play), the instrument (the six-string), the effort (the fingers), the contact (the string meetin' the fret)—all comin' together to make this momentary chord called "action." No single part of it is the "boss." No solid "I" in the center.

**Karma Without a Karma-Keeper:**
The deeds are done. The consequences roll on. But there ain't no little soul inside shuttlin' from life to life like a train on a track. It's just the momentum of the pattern, the habit-energy of the melody, carryin' on dependently. The liberation is seein' through the illusion of the soloist, which cuts the root of sufferin'—the clingin' to "I did that" or "That happened to *me*." You just play the changes as they come.

## Verse 9.1

### I. Source Text
**darśanaśravaṇādīni vedanādīni cāpy atha |**
**bhaṅgādīnīti cāpy eṣāṃ tatteṣām asti no vā ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"Seeing, hearing, and the like; as well as feeling and the like;
And the destroyed [elements] and the like—does 'That' [the Prior Entity] belong to them, or not?"

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Darśana-śravaṇa-ādīni** ("Seeing, hearing, etc."): Refers to the six sense faculties (*indriya*) and their operations. The opponent argues these are instruments (*karaṇa*), implying an agent (*kartṛ*). *Note: The argument hinges on the grammatical requirement that an instrument (e.g., a telescope) requires a user. Nāgārjuna denies this duality.*
*   **Vedanādīni** ("Feeling, etc."): Refers to the five aggregates (*skandha*), specifically the mental factors that accompany experience.
*   **Tat-teṣām** ("That of them"): "That" (*tat*) refers to the *Pūrva* (Prior Entity/Self). The genitive *teṣām* ("of them") indicates possession. The question is ontological: Does a possessor exist prior to the possessed?

### IV. The Blues Interpretation
**Title: "Nobody Before the Blues"**

(Verse 1)
They say there’s a Watcher waitin' ‘fore the sun comes up,
(Yeah, some secret soul pourin' coffee in the cup)
But if nobody’s tastin’, tell me who’s to blame?
Without the hurtin’, baby, you ain't got no name.

---

## Verse 9.2

### I. Source Text
**teṣāṃ caiva bhaved bhāvaḥ kas teṣāṃ ca bhaviṣyati |**
**darśanaśravaṇādīni vedanādīni cāpy atha ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"If 'That' [the Entity] were to exist [prior], how could it exist for them?
[And if it exists through them], then seeing, hearing, and the like [would exist independent of it]."

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Bhaved bhāvaḥ** ("Were to exist"): Conditional tense. Nāgārjuna grants the premise for the sake of argument.
*   **Kas teṣāṃ** ("Who for them?"): If the Soul exists *before* seeing, it is blind. How can a blind Soul be the "Seer" of seeing? The relationship of appropriation (*upādāna*) is impossible without the appropriated (*upādeya*).

### IV. The Blues Interpretation

(Verse 2)
If you sittin' in the dark before you turn the light,
(Tell me, brother, are you blind or is it night?)
You claim you’re the Singer before you sing the song,
But a ghost without a guitar can’t play along.

---

## Verse 9.3

### I. Source Text
**atha kaścid bhaved bhāvaḥ prāk tebhyo 'sti sa kiṃ mataḥ |**
**sa ca taṃ parigṛhṇīyād bhāvo bhāvaṃ hi kasya cit ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"If some entity were to exist prior to those [faculties], what is it considered to be?
And [if] that entity appropriates them, then indeed, that entity belongs to whom?"

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Prāk** ("Prior"): The central target of this chapter. Temporal priority implies ontological independence.
*   **Parigṛhṇīyād** ("Should appropriate"): From root *grah* (to grasp). The Self is defined as the *grasper* of the aggregates. But if the grasper exists before the grasping, what is it grasping?

### IV. The Blues Interpretation

(Verse 3)
You say you’re the Driver before you bought the car,
(Standin' on the corner, wishin' on a star)
But if you ain't got no wheels, you ain't grabbin' the street,
Can’t own the rhythm, Lord, without the beat.

---

## Verse 9.4

### I. Source Text
**pṛthag bhāvo 'samāptaś ca na deśo 'sti na kālaḥ |**
**na bhāvaḥ kuta evāsya pṛthag bhāvo bhaviṣyati ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"A separate entity is not established; neither place nor time exists [for it].
If the entity does not exist [independently], how can a separate entity come to be?"

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Pṛthag bhāva** ("Separate entity"): The Soul/Self (*ātman*) posited as existing apart from the aggregates.
*   **Asamāpta** ("Not concluded/established"): Without the characteristics of seeing, etc., the entity has no definition. It is a "sky-flower."

### IV. The Blues Interpretation

(Verse 4)
You say you’re the Captain, separate from the ship,
(Standin' on dry land while the vessel takes a dip)
But a Captain with no boat, Lord, he ain't got no crew,
You’re just a lonely shadow with nothin' left to do.

---

## Verse 9.5

### I. Source Text
**yadi ca syāt pṛthag bhāvo darśanādeḥ pṛthak tataḥ |**
**syāt pṛthag darśanādy eva bhāvena tu vinā bhavet ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"And if a separate entity were to exist, distinct from seeing and so forth,
Then seeing and so forth would exist separately, existing indeed without that entity."

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Vinā bhavet** ("Would exist without"): The consequence of dualism. If the Self is independent of Seeing, then Seeing should function without a Self. But "seeing without a seer" is absurd to the opponent.

### IV. The Blues Interpretation

(Verse 5)
If the Blues can hurt you when you ain't around,
(Like a ghost guitar makin' a lonesome sound)
Then the pain don't need you, baby, to make it real,
It’s just a broken heart that forgot how to feel.

---

## Verse 9.6

### I. Source Text
**kasya cit kim cid evāsti na ca bhāvo 'sti kasya cit |**
**na ca bhāvena vināsti darśanādi kuto bhavet ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"Someone has something, but no entity belongs to anyone.
And without an entity, seeing and so forth does not exist; whence could it arise?"

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Kasya cit** ("Of someone"): The grammatical relation of possession requires two terms. If the "Owner" is a fiction, the "Owned" (the eye, the ear) loses its status as an instrument.

### IV. The Blues Interpretation

(Verse 6)
You say "This is my hammer," you say "This is my song,"
(But tell me, Mr. Owner, where do you belong?)
If there ain't no "You," there ain't no "Mine,"
Just empty boxcars rollin' down the line.

---

## Verse 9.7

### I. Source Text
**na ca bhāvo 'sti bāhyo 'pi na ca bhāvo 'sti cāntaraḥ |**
**na cāsti bhāvo bāhyo 'pi kuto bhāvo bhaviṣyati ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"The entity implies neither an external nor an internal existence.
And neither does the external entity exist; whence will the entity exist?"

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Bāhyo/Antaraḥ** ("External/Internal"): The Self is not outside the aggregates (like a Pilot) nor inside them (like a Seed).

### IV. The Blues Interpretation

(Verse 7)
I checked the front porch, I checked the kitchen floor,
(Looking for the Man who don't live here no more)
He ain't outside knocking, he ain't inside hidin',
Just a rumour of a Ghost that we all abidin'.

---

## Verse 9.8

### I. Source Text
**evam eva hi sarveṣāṃ gamanaṃ pratiṣidhyate |**
**gantā ca gamanād anyo nanyas tasmān na vidyate ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"In this very way, the going of all [senses] is refuted.
The goer is not other than the going, nor is he non-other; thus he is not found."

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Gantā/Gamana** ("Goer/Going"): Nāgārjuna recycles the argument from Chapter 2 (*Gatāgata-parīkṣā*). The Agent (*kartṛ*) cannot be established as identical to nor distinct from the Action (*kriyā*).

### IV. The Blues Interpretation

(Verse 8)
You can't have a Walker if the Road is gone,
(Can't have a Singer if there ain't no Song)
If you ain't movin', baby, you ain't standin' still,
Just a imaginary figure on a imaginary hill.

---

## Verse 9.9

### I. Source Text
**gantā ca gamanād anyo nanyas tasmān na vidyate |**
**gamanāny api sarvāṇi gatyā gatir nivāryate ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"The goer is not other than the going, nor is he non-other; thus he is not found.
All goings are prevented by the [analysis of] going by means of going."

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Na vidyate** ("Is not found"): The final ontological dismissal. The Agent is a conceptual fiction imputed upon the stream of action.

### IV. The Blues Interpretation

(Verse 9)
I went down to the crossroads, tried to flag a ride,
(Looked in the mirror, but there was no one inside)
I ain't the Walker, Lord, and I ain't the Road,
Just a heavy burden without no heavy load.

---

## Verse 9.10-9.12 (Conclusion)

### I. Source Text
**tasmād darśanādīni vedanādīni cāpy atha |**
**bhaṅgādīnīti cāpy eṣāṃ tatteṣām asti no vā ||**

### II. Scholarly Translation
"Therefore, seeing and the like, and feeling and the like,
And the destroyed elements—'That' [Prior Entity] does not exist for them."

### III. Philological Commentary
*   **Tasmād** ("Therefore"): Conclusion (*nigamana*).
*   **Asti no vā** ("Exists or not"): The dilemma is resolved by negation. The *Pūrva* (Prior Self) is a conceptual fiction (*prapañca*).

### IV. The Blues Interpretation

(Verse 10-12)
So pack up your suitcase, leave your name behind,
(There ain't no "Me" that the devil can find)

**Title: "Burnin' Without Wood"**

(Verse 1)
If the Fire is the Wood, Lord, tell me what it burns?
(Like a dog chasin' tails, twistin' in the turns)
But if the Fire ain't the Wood, floatin' in the air,
Then you got a phantom flame that just ain't there.

(Verse 2)
You say your love is eternal, don't need no spark,
(Glowin' like a neon sign deep in the dark)
But if you don't need lightin', you don't need a match,
Just a lonely old door without no latch.

(Verse 3)
If you don't need nobody, you don't need to try,
(Sittin' on a mountain, high in the sky)
But a fire that burns without no wood to eat,
Is a cold, cold lie in the summer heat.

(Verse 4)
You met me at the station, distinct as day and night,
(We shook hands politely, tryin' to be polite)
But if I’m the water and you’re the stone,
We can touch forever, but I’m still alone.

(Verse 5)
If you can't reach me, baby, you can't make me cry,
(Just a distant thunder in a cloudy sky)
If the fire don't touch, the wood stays green,
The saddest situation that I ever seen.

(Verse 6)
You say it’s like a lover walkin' through the door,
(Like a man and a woman on the dance floor)
But lovers walk away when the dance is through,
The Fire eats the Wood, baby, that ain't me and you.

(Verse 7)
I can hold your hand, but I can't steal your soul,
(Unless we’re mixin' ashes in the same old bowl)
If we’re truly different, we can never blend,
Just two strangers waitin' for the end.

(Verse 8)
Did the blues start the trouble, or the trouble start the blues?
(I’m walkin' in circles in my travelin' shoes)
Can't have a shadow without the man,
Can't have the man without the master plan.

(Verse 9)
If the Fire needs the Wood to say its name,
(Who was holdin' the match before the flame?)
If the Wood needs the Fire to make it burn,
It’s a broken record that just won't turn.

(Verse 10)
A father makes a son, a son makes a dad,
(Best family riddle that I ever had)
If nobody’s first, then nobody’s last,
Just a ghost train movin' way too fast.

(Verse 11)
If you ain't got a job, you can't get paid,
(But you need the money for the trade you made)
If you’re already rich, you don't need a dime,
If you’re broke, you’re just wastin' precious time.

(Verse 12)
The Fire don't lean on the Wood, no sir,
(And the Wood don't lean on the Fire, that’s clear)
They ain't hooked up, and they ain't apart,
Just a hole in the middle of a achin' heart.

(Verse 13)
The flame didn't come from the city lights,
(And it ain't hidin' in the wood on winter nights)
It didn't go away, and it didn't stay,
It just flashed and faded, then it blew away.

(Verse 14)
The Wood ain't the Fire, the Fire ain't the Wood,
(You couldn't catch 'em separate if you understood)
The Fire don't own the Wood like a man owns land,
It’s slippin' like water through your open hand.

(Verse 15)
So listen to the Fire and listen to the Soul,
(It’s the same old story that the Buddha told)
The Pot ain't the Clay, the Cloth ain't the Thread,
If you look for the Self, you’re talkin' to the dead.

(Verse 16)
If you think you’re a Soul in a bag of skin,
(Separate from the world that you livin' in)
You can read all the books on the dusty shelf,
But you don't know nothin' 'bout the Self.

**Title: "Ain't No Start Line"**

(Verse 1)
The Big Boss Man said it, way back in the day,
(Before the blues was born, before we learned to play)
You can search the horizon, look for where it began,
But there ain't no start line for the soul of a man.

(Verse 2)
If you ain't got a beginning, you can't have an end,
(It’s a circle, baby, twistin' round the bend)
How you gonna find the middle of a ring?
It’s just an endless song that the shadows sing.

(Verse 3)
If Birth came first, strutting proud and tall,
(Before the winter wind began to call)
You’d be an immortal baby, never growin' old,
A story with a beginning that can never be told.

(Verse 4)
If Death came first, waitin' at the gate,
(Before you even born, sealin' up your fate)
Then who is doing the dyin', if nobody’s there?
Just a grim reaper cuttin' empty air.

(Verse 5)
If they walked in together, hand in hand,
(Birth and Death dancin' in the same old band)
You’d be dyin' while you’re cryin' your very first breath,
A cradle made of cypress, smellin' like death.

(Verse 6)
You can’t put 'em in order, you can’t make 'em fit,
(The pieces of the puzzle just don't wanna sit)
So why you buildin' castles out of smoke and sand?
Tryin' to map a river in a floodin' land.

(Verse 7)
It ain't just livin', it’s the cause and the effect,
(Every broken promise that you try to collect)
The feelin' and the feeler, the hammer and the stone,
Ain't nobody started this trouble alone.

(Verse 8)
It ain't just the sorrow, it ain't just the pain,
(It’s every drop of water in the pourin' rain)
Nothin' has a birthday, nothin' has a tomb,
Just an endless weavin' on a ghostly loom.

**Title: "The Blame Game"**

(Verse 1)
Did I break my own heart, or did you break it too?
(Was it me, was it them, or a demon in the blue?)
Everybody’s guessin' where the trouble began,
But pointin' fingers, baby, ain't the master plan.

(Verse 2)
If I built this prison, then I hold the key,
(But I don't remember lockin' up the real me)
If the man I was yesterday is dead and gone,
Then who is this stranger singin' this sad song?

(Verse 3)
If you built this prison, just to watch me cry,
(Like a cruel puppet master in the big blue sky)
Then I’m servin' time for a crime I didn't do,
And that ain't justice, Lord, that’s just the blues.

(Verse 4)
If I’m the Sufferer before the pain arrives,
(Livin' in the shadows of a thousand lives)
Who am I without the hurt to say my name?
Just a hollow echo in a burnin' flame.

(Verse 5)
If the pain is floatin' free, without a soul to bite,
(Like a rabid dog howlin' in the middle of the night)
It don't belong to me, and it don't belong to you,
Just a phantom misery passin' through.

You say it’s "Someone Else," but who are you to say?
(Without a "Me" to stand here, "You" just fade away)
We’re leanin' on each other like a house of cards,
Fallin' down together in the same backyards.

(Verse 7)
I can't hurt myself 'cause I ain't solid ground,
(I’m changin' like the weather when the wind comes 'round)
And you can't hurt me neither, 'cause we’re intertwined,
Like the rhythm and the melody in the same old mind.

(Verse 8)
It wasn't me alone, and it wasn't just the town,
(It wasn't both together that brought the hammer down)
Two wrongs don't make a right, two ghosts don't make a man,
Tryin' to catch the wind with a broken hand.

(Verse 9)
It didn't come from nothin', like a bolt from the blue,
(Sufferin' has a reason, just like me and you)
If it fell out of the sky without a seed to grow,
We’d be cryin' forever with nowhere to go.

(Verse 10)
It ain't just the heartache, it’s the tree and the stone,
(Nothin' in this world ever stands alone)
The flower needs the rain, and the rain needs the cloud,
Ain't nobody separate, ain't nobody proud.

**Title: "The Neon Mirage"**

(Verse 1)
The Good Lord said everything is a beautiful lie,
(Like a neon sign flashin' in a midnight sky)
It looks so solid, it looks so bright and clear,
But when you reach to touch it, baby, it just disappears.

(Verse 2)
If it’s all a hustle, tell me who’s gettin' played?
(Is it the dreamer or the dream that the devil made?)
It ain't about the swindle, it ain't about the scheme,
It’s just the empty nature of the whole damn scene.

(Verse 3)
You know it’s empty 'cause it’s always on the move,
(Like a scratchy record jumpin' out the groove)
If it was what it was, it would never, ever change,
But the world keeps shiftin', lookin' mighty strange.

(Verse 4)
How you gonna change if you’re already set in stone?
(Like a frozen statue sittin' on a throne)
But if you’re just a shadow with no nature of your own,
What is it that’s movin' through the skin and bone?

(Verse 5)
The milk don't turn to whiskey by stayin' the same,
(And it don't turn to whiskey by just changin' its name)
If they were truly different, they’d never, ever meet,
Change is a mystery walkin' down the street.

(Verse 6)
The young man ain't dyin' while he’s young and free,
(And the old man’s already what he’s gonna be)
So who is doin' the fadin', who is doin' the turn?
It’s a lonesome lesson that we all gotta learn.

(Verse 7)
If you had a "Something," you could have a "Nothin'" too,
(But the "Something" is a phantom that we’re lookin' through)
Emptiness ain't a thing you can put in your hand,
It’s just the shiftin' of the desert sand.

(Verse 8)
Emptiness is the medicine for every sick mind,
(The only way to leave all your troubles behind)
But if you fall in love with the cure and the pill,
Then you’re a dyin' man, baby, and you always will.

**Title: "We Ain't Never Met"**

(Verse 1)
The Seer and the Seen, standin' eye to eye,
(Like two old lovers 'neath a stormy sky)
They try to touch, they try to make a connection,
But it’s just a trick of the light, a ghostly reflection.

(Verse 2)
The Lover and the Beloved, burnin' with desire,
(Thinkin' they can meet inside the ring of fire)
But the fire ain't separate from the wood it burns,
It’s a lonely lesson that the heart never learns.

(Verse 3)
To shake a man’s hand, you gotta be apart,
(Different names, different faces, different heart)
But if we’re truly different, like the oil and the rain,
We just slide on by, ridin' separate trains.

(Verse 4)
If you ain't got a "Me," you can't have a "You,"
(That’s the hardest logic that a man can chew)
Association is a game for things that are real,
But we’re just shadows spinnin' on a wheel.

(Verse 5)
"Left" needs "Right" just to know its name,
(Without the other side, it’s a losin' game)
If you take away the "Right," the "Left" is gone,
Just a heavy silence where the word belongs.

(Verse 6)
If "Different" was real, it would stand alone,
(Like a king on a mountain, sittin' on a throne)
It wouldn't need a neighbor to define its face,
But nothin' stands alone in this empty place.

(Verse 7)
Difference ain't hidin' in the things you see,
(It ain't in the bird and it ain't in the tree)
If you can't find "Different," you can't find "The Same,"
It’s just empty smoke risin' from the flame.

(Verse 8)
So don't try to hold me, don't try to bind,
(There ain't no glue in the universal mind)
The Meetin', the Met, and the Meeting Place,
Are just clouds dissolvin' in infinite space.

**Title: "The Middle Path Blues"**

(Verse 1)
If you built it in a factory, if you bought it in a store,
(It ain't the real thing, baby, just a plastic chore)
If it comes from a reason, if it comes from a cause,
It ain't got no Nature, it’s just obeyin' laws.

(Verse 2)
You talk about your "Nature" like it’s carved in stone,
(Sittin' independent on a golden throne)
But if you depend on water, and you depend on air,
Your "Independent Nature" just ain't there.

(Verse 3)
If you ain't got a Self, you can't have an Other,
(Can't have a stranger if you ain't got a brother)
"Other" is just "Self" seen from across the street,
Two empty shadows dancin' to the beat.

(Verse 4)
If you take away the Self, and take away the Friend,
(Where does the Beginning start, where does the Ending end?)
The world is just a stage with nobody to play,
Just a ghost town waitin' for the break of day.

(Verse 5)
If nothin' ever was, then nothin's ever gone,
(You can't lose a battle that was never on)
"Non-existence" is just a word for things that fade,
A shadow of a shadow in the cool, cool shade.

(Verse 6)
You look for the Real, you look for the Void,
(But the Truth is a place that you try to avoid)
If you say "It Is," you’re blinded by the light,
If you say "It Ain't," you’re lost in the night.

(Verse 7)
Old Man Katyāyana asked the Lord for the news,
(He said, "Lord, tell me how to shake these existential blues")
The Lord said, "Son, don't say It Is, and don't say It Ain't,
That’s the devil’s painting, and that’s the devil’s paint."

(Verse 8)
If you were born Eternal, you could never die,
(You’d be a frozen statue in a painted sky)
But Nature don't change, that’s what the wise men say,
So if you’re changin', baby, you weren't real anyway.

(Verse 9)
If you got a Nature, how you gonna turn?
(If you’re made of water, how you gonna burn?)
But if you ain't got Nature, who is turnin' round?
Just a leaf blowin' silence on the ground.

(Verse 10)
"It Is" is a trap that holds you in the past,
(Thinkin' that the good times are gonna last)
"It Ain't" is a hole where you fall right through,
Neither one is gonna save you from the blues.

(Verse 11)
So walk that tightrope, way up in the air,
(Don't look down at the darkness there)
Don't lean to the left, don't lean to the right,
Just keep on walkin' through the middle of the night.

**Title: "The Jailhouse Blues"**

(Verse 1)
I been wanderin' round this circle since the day I was born,
(Shoes are tattered and my soul is worn)
But if I ain't the body and I ain't the mind,
Tell me who it is that’s leavin' these tracks behind?

(Verse 2)
I looked in the mirror, checked the eyes and the skin,
(Looked for the sinner who committed the sin)
But I couldn't find the Walker, just the dust on the road,
A heavy sensation without no load.

(Verse 3)
If my soul is eternal, it can't move an inch,
(Like a stone statue on a marble bench)
If my soul is a shadow that fades in the light,
Then who’s gonna make it through the long, dark night?

(Verse 4)
You say you want Freedom, you want to be free,
(But tell me, brother, who is this "Me"?)
A ghost can't be handcuffed, a ghost can't be chained,
And a ghost can't be dry when it’s pourin' rain.

(Verse 5)
The shackles don't hold me, the cell ain't real,
(It’s just a spinnin' cog in a phantom wheel)
Things come together and things fall apart,
But nothin' ever enters the human heart.

(Verse 6)
If you holdin' on tight, you’re already bound,
(Chasin' your tail like a hungry hound)
If you let it all go, there ain't nothin' to tie,
Just a wide open space in a empty sky.

(Verse 7)
Can't lock up a prisoner before he’s a man,
(That ain't the way that the warden planned)
If the prisoner is missin', the jail is a joke,
Just iron bars made of cigarette smoke.

(Verse 8)
If you’re tied to the track, you can't walk away,
(And if you’re walkin' away, you ain't tied today)
You can't be a prisoner and a free man too,
That’s a logical riddle that’ll make you blue.

(Verse 9)
"I’m gonna get to Heaven, I’m gonna be saved,"
(That’s what it says on the stone on the grave)
But wantin' to be empty is the biggest load,
Just another heavy sack on the same old road.

(Verse 10)
I stopped lookin' for Freedom, stopped runnin' from Pain,
(Stopped tryin' to stay dry in the pourin' rain)
Samsara and Nirvana, they’re the same damn town,
Just depends on if you’re up or if you’re down.

**Title: "The I.O.U. Blues"**

(Verse 1)
Be kind to your neighbor, keep your mind real cool,
(Don't be actin' crazy, don't be actin' like a fool)
That’s the seed you plantin', deep in the ground,
Gonna grow a sweet apple when the harvest comes round.

(Verse 2)
The Prophet said Karma is the will and the deed,
(It’s the thought in your head and the hunger you feed)
There’s a thousand ways to do it, a thousand ways to fall,
But the thought is the trigger that starts it all.

(Verse 6)
If the deed stays forever, it’s a heavy, heavy stone,
(Like a unwanted guest who won't leave you alone)
But if the deed disappears like smoke in the air,
How’s it gonna find you when the cupboard is bare?

(Verse 7-11)
You say it’s like a seed turnin' into a sprout,
(A long green line that snakes all about)
But if the seed is gone when the fruit appears,
Why am I cryin' for a sin from yesteryears?

(Verse 13-14)
So you invented a ghost called "The Imperishable One,"
(Like a shadow that stays when the day is done)
It’s a I.O.U. note in the bank of the sky,
Says "You owe me, baby" until the day you die.

(Verse 15)
You say the action fades but the debt stays true,
(Like a stain on the collar of a shirt written "You")
You tryin' to fix the hole in the bottom of the sack,
With a patch made of dreams that you can't give back.

(Verse 20)
If the debt was real, like a rock or a tree,
(It would last forever, through eternity)
You’d never pay it off, you’d never be free,
Just a lifer in the prison of history.

(Verse 21)
If the Doer is real, he’s gotta stay the same,
(Can't change his face, can't change his name)
But if he don't change, he can't feel the pain,
You can't get wet if you ain't in the rain.

(Verse 22)
We want the sweet fruit, we run from the sour,
(Chasin' the pleasure, hour after hour)
But if the fruit was locked inside the seed,
The hunger and the feast would be the same damn deed.

(Verse 23)
It ain't natural, baby, it’s just a masquerade,
(A costume party that the devil made)
If it was Real Nature, it would stand alone,
But everything I see is just a loan.

(Verse 24-25)
The Sin ain't in the body, the Sin ain't in the soul,
(It ain't in the part, and it ain't in the whole)
It’s like a City in the Clouds, shinin' in the sun,
You walk towards the gate, and it comes undone.

(Verse 27)
We spinnin' a web, but the spider is gone,
(The music is playin', but it ain't no song)
Samsara is a engine runnin' on no gas,
Waitin' for a future that will never pass.

(Verse 30)
It’s like a Magic Man puttin' on a show,
(Pullin' rabbits from a hat in a long, dark row)
The Magician makes a Puppet, and the Puppet makes a scene,
And neither one knows what the drama really means.

(Verse 31)
I’m the Puppet, baby, and my Deed is the Act,
(That’s the cold, hard, illusory fact)
I’m a shadow cast by nothin' on a wall of smoke,
Laughin' at the punchline of a cosmic joke.

(Verse 33)
The Debt ain't real, but you still gotta pay,
(That’s the riddle of the Blues, what can I say?)
It’s a Dream within a Dream, a Mirage in the sand,
But you still gotta walk it like a natural man.

**Title: "Nobody's Home"**

(Verse 1)
If the Soul is the Body, it dies in the grave,
(Ain't no prayer or magic that can save)
If the Soul ain't the Body, floatin' in the air,
It can't feel the hunger, can't feel the despair.

(Verse 2)
If there ain't no "Me," there ain't no "Mine,"
(No fence around the yard, no property line)
When the Owner leaves the house, the walls fall down,
Just a pile of bricks in a ghost town.

(Verse 3)
If you strut around sayin' "I ain't got no Pride,"
(Keepin' all your holiness locked up inside)
You just built a new ego, shiny and clean,
The biggest hypocrite that the world ever seen.

(Verse 4)
When "Me" and "Mine" fade like the settin' sun,
(The long war is over, the battle is done)
The grabbin' hands open, the birth-cord breaks,
No more shiverin' with the cold, cold shakes.

(Verse 5)
Freedom comes when the stories stop,
(When the needle jumps off the record shop)
The stories come from thinkin', thinkin' comes from fear,
But the Truth is silence ringin' in your ear.

(Verse 6)
The Boss Man told the sinner, "You got a Soul to save,"
He told the rich man, "It all ends in the grave,"
But to the quiet ones, he whispered low,
"It ain't Yes or No, baby, it’s just the flow."

(Verse 7)
When the thinkin' stops, the talkin' dies,
(Like a bird vanishin' in the empty skies)
Reality don't need no word, don't need no name,
It was here before the candle and here before the flame.

(Verse 8)
It’s Real, it Ain't Real, it’s Both, it’s Neither,
(Like a fever dream or a gospel believer)
Whatever gets you through the long dark night,
Whatever turns the darkness into light.

(Verse 9)
You can't learn it from a book, can't buy it in a store,
(You gotta walk through the fire to get to the door)
It’s peaceful, it’s quiet, it don't make a sound,
It’s the solid rock in the shiftin' ground.

(Verse 10)
It ain't the same river, but it ain't a new stream,
(Just wakin' up slowly from a complicated dream)
We ain't eternal, but we don't disappear,
Just changin' shapes year after year.

(Verse 12)
When the preachers are gone and the churches burn down,
(And there ain't no Bible in the whole damn town)
The Loner finds the Truth in the fallin' rain,
Walkin' by himself down the glory lane.

(Verse 1)
If Tomorrow is hidin' inside of Today,
(Waitin' for the clock to tick it away)
Then Tomorrow is already Yesterday's news,
Just a recycling bin for the same old blues.

(Verse 2)
If Tomorrow ain't connected to the days gone by,
(Float in' loose in the empty sky)
Then you can't get there from where you stand,
It’s a foreign country in a phantom land.

(Verse 3)
"Up" ain't "Up" without the "Down,"
(And the "King" ain't King without the "Clown")
You take away the Left, you lose the Right,
You take away the Day, you lose the Night.

(Verse 4)
Time is a shadow that needs a wall,
(If the wall falls down, the shadow don't fall)
It needs a "Thing" to measure, a "Thing" to age,
But there ain't no actor on this empty stage.

(Verse 5)
You can't catch the moment while it’s passin' through,
(It slips through your fingers like the mornin' dew)
And you can't catch it stoppin', 'cause it never stays still,
Just a tumbleweed rollin' down a lonely hill.

(Verse 6)
I looked at my watch, but the face was blank,
(Like a bounced check at the Memory Bank)
If there ain't no "Me" to wither and fade,
Then Time is just a ghost in the shade.

**Title: "The Missing Ingredient"**

(Verse 1)
If the Seed meets the Fruit, they shakin' hands,
(But two things in one place, the logic don't stand)
If the Seed is the daddy and the Fruit is the son,
They can't be standin' together when the work is done.

(Verse 2)
If they stay apart, like strangers in the street,
(Never say hello, never really meet)
How’s the Seed gonna tell the Fruit to grow?
It’s like tryin' to mail a letter with no place to go.

(Verse 5)
You can't glue 'em together, can't tear 'em apart,
(It’s a broken connection in a hungry heart)
If they touch, they’re the same; if they don't, they’re dead,
Just a circular riddle ringin' in your head.

(Verse 9)
If the Fire goes out before the Water boils,
(All your hard work is just wasted toils)
If the Cause is dead and buried in the ground,
How’s the Effect gonna hear the trumpet sound?

(Verse 11)
If you lock 'em in a room and throw away the key,
(Sayin' "Make me a baby, make me history")
If they fused together like a lump of clay,
You ain't got no Cause, you ain't got no Day.

(Verse 16)
If the Song is already written, why you tryin' to write?
(Why you burnin' candles in the middle of the night?)
If the Song ain't there, in the air or the ink,
You can't pour a glass if there ain't no drink.

(Verse 19)
The Daddy needs the Baby to be a Dad,
(The Baby needs the Daddy or it’s mighty sad)
They lean on each other like a house of cards,
Fallin' down together in the same backyards.

(Verse 24)
You gather up the wood, you gather up the spark,
(Tryin' to make a fire in the chillin' dark)
You call it a "Combination," say it’s guaranteed,
But a pile of zeros is all you really need.

(Verse 1)
You can't have the Good Times without the Bad,
(Can't lose the money that you never had)
If the Rise and Fall are holdin' hands,
It’s a shaky foundation on shiftin' sands.

(Verse 2)
If you try to die before you’re born,
(Like a midnight shadow in the early morn)
You’re puttin' the cart before the mule,
Breakin' every single natural rule.

(Verse 3)
But if you try to live while you’re dyin' too,
(Wearin' one old sock and one new shoe)
The Life and the Death fight for the space,
Like two runners in a single lane race.

(Verse 4)
Nothing stays steady, nothing stays still,
(Water runnin' down the side of the hill)
If you think you’re livin' without the decay,
You’re just a fool dreamin' the day away.

(Verse 6)
They ain't together and they ain't apart,
(Like a crack runnin' through a broken heart)
Birth and Death are a package deal,
Two sides spinnin' on the same old wheel.

(Verse 11)
You say, "I see the baby, then I see the grave,"
(Like a calm ocean before the wave)
But if the baby is safe from the dyin' day,
He’d be a stone statue that could never play.

(Verse 13)
You say, "It’s all over, the lights are out,"
(Livin' in the shadow of a heavy doubt)
But you can't turn off what was never on,
You can't see the sunset without the dawn.

(Verse 17)
Is the man in the coffin the man in the crib?
(Or is it just a story, is it just a fib?)
If he’s the same, then he didn't change,
If he’s different, Lord, it’s mighty strange.

(Verse 21)
I looked at my soul in the mirror glass,
(Watchin' the seasons come and pass)
I ain't born, and I ain't dead,
Just a ghostly song in a worryin' head.

(Verse 1)
I looked for the Buddha in the temple hall,
(Looked for his shadow on the painted wall)
He wasn't the paint, and he wasn't the stone,
And he wasn't hidin' in the golden throne.

(Verse 2)
If he’s made of parts, like a old V-8,
(Runnin' on karma and runnin' on fate)
Then he ain't got a soul that stands alone,
Just a engine rattlin' in the danger zone.

(Verse 3)
You can't have the Man without the Parts,
(You can't have the Love without the Hearts)
If you strip 'em away, sayin' "Show me the King,"
You ain't gonna find a solitary thing.

(Verse 4)
If he was Real before the body was born,
(Waitin' in the sky like a harvest corn)
Why would he come down to this dirty place?
Why would he wear a dyin' human face?

(Verse 11)
Don't call him "Empty," don't call him "Full,"
(That’s just the wool that the preachers pull)
"Empty" is a word for a jar that’s dry,
"Full" is a word for a cloudy sky.
It’s just a signpost pointin' down the road,
Help you carry the heavy, heavy load.

(Verse 12)
Is he Forever? Is he Gonna Die?
(Is he in the ground or in the sky?)
You askin' questions that don't make sense,
Like askin' a cloud for fifty cents.
When the fire goes out, where does it go?
That’s a secret that the ashes know.

(Verse 13)
If you think he’s solid, like a piece of wood,
(You misunderstood, yeah, you misunderstood)
You tryin' to catch smoke in a butterfly net,
Gonna wake up soakin' in a cold, cold sweat.

(Verse 15)
You paintin' pictures of a man so grand,
(With a lotus flower in his open hand)
But if you worship the picture, you miss the Man,
You miss the silence where it all began.

(Verse 16)
You wanna know the Buddha? Look at yourself,
(Don't look at the statue on the dusty shelf)
The Empty Nature that makes him Free,
Is the same Empty Nature in you and me.
We’re all just shadows in the same old play,
Dancin' in the light of the breakin' day.

**Title: "Lookin' Through a Broken Glass"**

(Verse 1)
I fell in love with a picture in a magazine,
(Prettiest little thing that I ever seen)
But the love didn't come from the ink and the page,
It came from the hunger in my own ribcage.

(Verse 2)
You say it’s Beautiful, I say it’s Bad,
(The worst mistake that I ever had)
If the Beauty was real, like a diamond ring,
It wouldn't change into a ugly thing.

(Verse 6)
Everything you see, everything you touch,
(It don't amount to nothin' much)
It’s a Ghost City floatin' in the desert air,
You pack your bags, but nobody’s there.

(Verse 7)
Can a Reflection be dirty? Can a Shadow be clean?
(It’s just a trick of the light on the silver screen)
You scrub and you scrub 'til your fingers bleed,
But you can't wash the mud off a phantom steed.

(Verse 8)
You need the Ugly to know the Good,
(Like you need the rot to know the wood)
They lean on each other like two drunk friends,
Stumblin' down the road where the sidewalk ends.

(Verse 10)
If the Good ain't real, where’s the Love gonna go?
(Like a melted snowflake in the winter snow)
If the Bad ain't real, where’s the Hate gonna stay?
Just a bad dream waitin' for the break of day.

(Verse 13)
The Grabber and the Grabbed and the Grabbin' Hand,
(They all sink together in the quicksand)
When the struggle is over, and the fight is done,
You find out the battle was never begun.

(Verse 14)
Who’s the Fool lookin' through the broken glass?
(Watchin' the distorted shadows pass)
If there ain't no "Who," then there ain't no "Wrong,"
Just a skipped beat in a perfect song.

(Verse 21)
Turn off the projector, and the movie dies,
(Wipe the illusion from your tired eyes)
When the lie is gone, the truth breaks through,
And there ain't nothin' left to make you blue.

(Verse 25)
The Lust and the Hate and the Ignorance too,
(They ain't in the sky and they ain't in you)
They’re just bad weather passin' overhead,
Listen to what the Good Lord said.

**Title: "The Baby and the Bathwater"**

(Verse 1)
You say if everything is empty, there ain't no hill to climb,
(No reason for the rhythm and no reason for the rhyme)
If the world is just a shadow, you say the Truth is gone,
And there ain't no point in singin' a gospel song.

(Verse 6)
You say I’m a Nihilist, a man who don't believe,
(Tryin' to sell a hollow dream, hidin' up my sleeve)
You say I’m trashin' the Church and trashin' the Light,
Leavin' everybody stranded in the middle of the night.

(Verse 7)
But listen here, brother, you got it all wrong,
(You ain't heard the melody, you just heard the gong)
You think Emptiness means "Nothin's Really There,"
Like a man chasin' phantoms in the cold winter air.

(Verse 8)
The Boss Man told the story in two different ways,
(To help us navigate through these hazy days)
There’s the Way of the World, where we pay our dues,
And the Way of the Spirit, beyond the blues.

(Verse 10)
You can't get to the Top without the bottom stair,
(You can't get to the Heaven without the daily prayer)
Emptiness don't mean you stop doin' what’s right,
It’s the only thing that makes the candle burn so bright.

(Verse 11)
But watch out now, Emptiness is like a rattlesnake,
(One wrong move is the last one you’re gonna make)
If you grab it by the tail, thinkin' "Nothin' is Real,"
It’s gonna bite you in the heart, baby, that’s the deal.

(Verse 14)
If you understand Emptiness, the whole world is yours,
(The windows are open and so are the doors)
But if you think things are Solid, you’re locked in a cage,
Just a frozen actor on a static stage.

(Verse 15)
You’re lookin' for the horse that you already ride,
(Searchin' the world for what’s already inside)
You say my logic is bad, you say my vision is blurred,
But you’re the one who ain't heard the word.

(Verse 18)
Dependency is Emptiness, that’s the song I sing,
(Like the vibration hidin' in a guitar string)
It’s the Middle Way, baby, not too loose or too tight,
Just walkin' in the balance, walkin' in the light.

(Verse 20)
If things were Solid, you could never change,
(Everything would be permanent and mighty strange)
You’d be stuck in your sorrow, stuck in your pain,
With no hope of sunshine after the rain.
So it’s your way that kills the hope and the dream,
I’m just showin' you the water flowin' in the stream.

(Verse 21)
If your Pain was a mountain, made of solid rock,
(It wouldn't matter how loud you’d cry or knock)
It would stay there forever, a permanent scar,
Like a unreach able light from a distant star.

(Verse 31)
If the Freedom you’re seekin' was already done,
(Shinin' forever like a static sun)
You could never reach it, you could never find,
Just a treasure locked away in a frozen mind.

(Verse 36)
You think you’re defendin' the Truth and the Way,
(But you’re killin' the world with what you say)
If things don't depend on each other to be,
Then there ain't no river and there ain't no sea.

(Verse 38)
Action would be empty, effort would be dead,
(Just a bunch of useless noise in your head)
If you were born a sinner, a sinner you’d stay,
With no hope of washin' the stains away.

(Verse 40)
But if you see the Way that the world is tied,
(The knot in the middle where the Truth is hid)
You see the Heart of the Buddha, shinin' so true,
In the middle of the sorrow and the middle of you.
You see the Pain, and you see the Cure,
In the Empty Nature, shinin' so pure.

**Title: "Same Old Town"**

(Verse 1)
You packin' your bags for the Promised Land,
(Lookin' for a place where the mountains stand)
You say, "I gotta leave this world of pain,"
Tryin' to outrun the fallin' rain.

(Verse 3)
But Heaven ain't a place you can buy a ticket to,
(It ain't in the sky, and it ain't in the blue)
It ain't something you get, it ain't something you lose,
It’s just the quiet that comes after the blues.

(Verse 4)
If Heaven was a Thing, it would rot and rust,
(Turning all your diamonds back into dust)
If it was Real like a rock or a stone,
You’d still be sittin' on a dyin' throne.

(Verse 7)
And it ain't just Nothin', like a hole in the floor,
(You can't walk through a non-existent door)
If you blow out the flame, where does it go?
That’s a secret that only the ashes know.

(Verse 9)
Samsara is a wheel spinnin' round and round,
(Grindin' your bones into the hard, cold ground)
But if you stop tryin' to grab the wheel,
The spinnin' stops, and the wound can heal.

(Verse 19)
I looked at the Devil, and I looked at the Lord,
(One had a smile, and one had a sword)
But when I looked closer, beneath the mask,
They were the same face, performing the same task.

(Verse 20)
The Jailhouse and the Garden are the same damn place,
(Just depends on the look on your face)
There ain't no fence between the Here and the There,
Just a imaginary line in the empty air.

(Verse 24)
I stopped talkin' 'cause there ain't nothin' to say,
(The words just get in the glorious way)
The Buddha never preached, he never said a word,
Just the sound of the wind and the call of a bird.
Peace is the silence when the noise is done,
Two shadows mergin' in the settin' sun.

**Title: "The Domino Effect"**

(Verse 1)
Ignorance is the Warden, he holds the only key,
(Keepin' you locked up in this ancient misery)
He tells you "Build a Future," he tells you "Make a Plan,"
That’s how you build the prison for the soul of a man.

(Verse 2)
The Mind jumps in the Cradle, lookin' for a home,
(Afraid to walk the darkness all alone)
It finds a brand new body, a brand new name,
But it’s the same old player in the same old game.

(Verse 3)
Then the Eyes open up, and the Ears start to hear,
(The world comes rushin' in, loud and clear)
The Senses touch the Fire, the Senses touch the Ice,
Rollin' the bones on the devil’s dice.

(Verse 5)
It feels so good, you want it to stay,
(It feels so bad, you want it away)
That’s the Thirst, baby, the dryin' of the bone,
Craving for a water that you’ve never known.

(Verse 6)
You grab it with your hands, you grab it with your soul,
(Tryin' to fill the bottom of a bottomless hole)
The Grabbin' makes the Becomin', the Becomin' makes the Birth,
And you’re back on the treadmill of this weary earth.

(Verse 7)
Then comes the Grey Hair, then comes the Pain,
(Tears fallin' down like the monsoon rain)
The coffin and the graveyard, the sorrow and the grief,
Just a tragic ending to a story brief.

(Verse 9)
But if you kill the Warden, the prisoners go free,
(If you turn on the light, the shadows flee)
Wisdom is the hammer that breaks the heavy chain,
Stoppin' the wheel in the driving rain.

(Verse 10)
One by one, the dominoes stop their fall,
(No more writin' on the prison wall)
No more Birth, no more Dyin' Breath,
Just a silence sweeter than the face of Death.
The Mass of Sorrow crumbles into dust,
In the empty wind of the perfect trust.

**Title: "The End of the Road"**

(Verse 1)
I looked in the rearview mirror, tryin' to see my face,
(Tryin' to find the startin' line of this human race)
Was I a King in a golden crown? Was I a beggar in the rain?
Or was I just a whisper in a hurricane?

(Verse 3)
If I was the same man then that I am today,
(I’d be a little bitty baby tryin' to sing and play)
But if I was a stranger, someone else entirely,
Then his sins ain't my sins, and I should go free.

(Verse 6)
You can't separate the Dancer from the Dance he does,
(Can't separate the "Is" from the "Was")
If the Soul stands alone, watchin' the body die,
It’s a cold, lonely eagle in an empty sky.

(Verse 8)
I ain't the Body, but I ain't not the Body neither,
(I ain't a True Believer and I ain't a Deceiver)
I’m like the heat in the fire, like the wet in the rain,
Can't have the pleasure without the pain.

(Verse 13)
You ask me if the World has got an End,
(Like a highway stoppin' at the river bend)
But the road keeps goin', round and round the bend,
And every new beginnin' is just another end.

(Verse 19)
"Finite" needs "Infinite" just to make a sound,
(Like the silence needs the noise to be found)
They lean on each other like two old drunks,
Sleepin' in the alley on the wooden bunks.

(Verse 30)
So put down your arguments, put down your pride,
(There ain't no place left for you to hide)
The Man didn't teach us so we could be smart,
He taught us how to heal the broken heart.
He said, "Let go of the Views, let go of the Lies,"
And wipe the dust of ages from your tired eyes.
I bow to the Man who showed the way,
To the glorious light of the breakin' day.
