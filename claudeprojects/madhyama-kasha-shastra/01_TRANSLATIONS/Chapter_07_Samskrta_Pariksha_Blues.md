# Chapter 7: Born, Stayin', Gone (The Conditioned Blues)

## The Trouble

You get to thinkin' life's a solid song. A clear start when you're born, a long middle while you're here, a sure end when you're gone. You believe in the comin' up, the hangin' on, and the passin' away like they're three stations on a railroad track. 

But, Lord, that track's a mirage. You go to grab the "beginning," it's already slippin' into "stayin'." You try to hold the "stayin'," it's already fadin' into "gone." And that "gone"? It ain't nothin' but the ghost of what never truly was. Clingin' to that trio is the root of all the lonesome, low-down heartache.

## Group 1 (Verses 7.1-7.4): The Problem of Arising

### Verse 7.1: Where Does "Comin' Into Being" Come From?

**The Teaching:**
If "comin' into being" was a real thing, by itself,
It'd have to show up in one of three ways:
From what's already here, from what ain't here at all,
Or from what's both here and gone.
But look close, now. All three roads lead to a muddy ditch.

**What It Means:**
If arising is a real, substantial thing, it must itself arise. But from what? The analysis shows all options fail.

---

### Verse 7.2: Already Here?

**The Teaching:**
Say it comes from what's *already here*.
Then what's "comin' into being"? It's already arrived!
That's like sayin' you're "born" again when you're already sittin' on the porch.
Ain't no new birth, just the same old tired man.

**What It Means:**
An existent thing can't "arise"—it's already there. Arising of what's already arisen is meaningless.

---

### Verse 7.3: From Nothing?

**The Teaching:**
And it can't come from what's *not here*.
That's like wishin' a child from a barren stone.
You can't get somethin' from nothin', nohow.
Where would it even start from? There's no ground for the seed.

**What It Means:**
You can't derive something from sheer non-existence. There's no basis, no cause, no ground.

---

### Verse 7.4: Both?

**The Teaching:**
And "both here and not here"? That's just two wrongs.
You mix a lie with a lie, you get a bigger lie.
So if it don't come from itself, from other, or from both...
Tell me, friend, just where does this "arising" call home?

**What It Means:**
Combining the flaws of both options doesn't solve the problem. The very concept of intrinsic arising has nowhere to stand.

---

## Group 2 (Verses 7.5-7.12): Duration and Cessation

### Verse 7.5: What Lasts?

**The Teaching:**
"Lastin'"—what we call stayin' a while—
Depends on this phantom "arising."
But if a thing never truly *got here*,
What in the world is there to "last"?
You can't prolong a shadow.

**What It Means:**
Duration presupposes something that arose. If arising is unfindable, so is duration.

---

### Verse 7.6: Duration of Duration?

**The Teaching:**
And if "lastin'" lasts, then what makes *that* last?
You'd need a lastin' of the lastin',
And a lastin' of that lastin' too.
The regress goes on like a blues song that won't end.

**What It Means:**
If duration is a real dharma, it needs its own duration—infinite regress.

---

### Verse 7.7-7.8: Cessation's Blues

**The Teaching:**
And "ceasin'"—the passin' away—
Also leans on this same "arising."
If a thing wasn't truly established,
How can it be said to "stop"?
And if cessation ceases... what stops *that* stoppin'?

**What It Means:**
Cessation faces identical problems. A stop that itself stops requires another stop, endlessly.

---

### Verses 7.9-7.12: The Three Can't Prop Each Other Up

**The Teaching:**
Maybe arisin' gives rise to lastin',
And lastin' holds up the ceasin',
And ceasin' circles back to arisin'?
But that's just three ghosts holdin' hands in the dark,
Pretendin' each one's more solid than the others.
Ain't none of 'em got a leg to stand on.

**What It Means:**
The three marks can't serve as foundations for each other. Mutually dependent, all are empty.

---

## Group 3 (Verses 7.13-7.19): The Three Marks Tangled Up

### The Teaching (Summary):

They say everything "conditioned" has these three stamps:
Born, stayin', gone.
But if the thing that's *supposed* to wear these stamps
Is never found in the first place,
Who's wearin' the tattoos?
You got three labels and nothin' to stick 'em on.

**What It Means:**
If the characterized (the conditioned thing) can't be established, neither can its characteristics. The relationship between mark and marked collapses.

---

## Group 4 (Verses 7.20-7.28): Being and Non-Being

### Verse 7.20: The Universal Negation

**The Teaching:**
Neither from what *is*, nor from what *ain't*,
Neither from *both* nor from *neither*,
Does anything ever truly come to be,
From anything, belonging to anyone, anywhere.

**What It Means:**
This is the tetralemma applied universally. All four logical possibilities for intrinsic arising are refuted. Not nihilism—just clarity about what "arising" can't mean.

---

### Verses 7.21-7.28: Every Option Fails

**The Teaching:**
You say it comes from what exists? It's already here.
From what don't exist? There's nothin' to come from.
From both? You're stacking contradictions.
From neither? That's just silence pretendin' to be an answer.

Every road you walk down leads back to this crossroads:
"Arising" ain't what you thought it was.
It's not a solid bridge from nowhere to somewhere.
It's just a word we use to point at the flow.

**What It Means:**
Each verse systematically closes off an escape route. The opponent's reified "arising" cannot survive analysis.

---

## Group 5 (Verses 7.29-7.34): Like a Dream

### Verse 7.29: The Great Comparison

**The Teaching:**
So what is this world of "born, stayin', gone"?
It's like a magic show—you see the trick, but there ain't no rabbit.
It's like a dream—you walk through walls, but wake up in your bed.
It's like a city in the desert sky—shimmerin' there, but ain't no streets to walk.

**What It Means:**
The similes are not poetic decoration. They're precise: illusions appear but mislead; dreams are experienced but insubstantial; mirages exist visually but can't be touched.

---

### Verse 7.30-7.31: Not Nothing

**The Teaching:**
But don't go thinkin' this means nothin's here!
The show is still playin'. The dream still unfolds.
It's just that the solidity you once believed in
Was never there in the first place.
The weight lifts—not 'cause the world disappeared,
But 'cause you stopped carryin' what was never real.

**What It Means:**
This isn't nihilism. Conventional appearance continues. What's negated is the reification—the belief that things exist "from their own side."

---

### Verse 7.32: The Teaching Is a Finger

**The Teaching:**
And even this teachin' about "no arisin'"
And these "three marks" that ain't solid marks—
Is just a finger pointin' at the moon.
It's a raft to cross the river of confusion.
Don't mistake the map for the territory.

**What It Means:**
The Mādhyamaka analysis is itself conventional. It's a tool, not an absolute doctrine to cling to.

---

### Verses 7.33-7.34: Freedom in the Flow

**The Teaching:**
For one who knows this deep in their bones,
The dust of sorrow don't cling.
The mind becomes clear, undisturbed,
Like still water after the storm.

No "arising" to chase, no "lasting" to hold, no "ceasing" to fear.
Seein' this, the heart finds its rest
Right in the middle of the comin' and goin'.
The Blues is still played, but the player is free.

**What It Means:**
Liberation is not escape from the conditioned world. It's seeing through the reification of "conditioned" into solid, graspable processes. In that seeing, peace.

---

## The Liberation

So you let go of the need for the song to have a solid start. You release the grip on makin' the groove last forever. You quit dreadin' the final chord. When "born, stayin', gone" lose their absolute weight, the whole world becomes a dance of dependently arisen notes. 

You pick up the guitar not to build a permanent monument, but to join the ever-flowin', empty, luminous river of sound. You play the Conditioned Blues, but you ain't conditioned by it. That, my friend, is the liberation of the open road. The freedom in the very flow you once feared.

## Theological Notes

| Term | Sanskrit | The Blues Reading |
|------|----------|-------------------|
| **Saṃskṛta** | संस्कृत | The conditioned—everything that comes and goes, arises and passes. The very fabric of the Blues world. |
| **Utpāda** | उत्पाद | Arising—the moment you pick up the guitar, the moment the heartache starts. |
| **Sthiti** | स्थिति | Duration—the middle of the song, the long stretch of longing. |
| **Nirodha** | निरोध | Cessation—the last note, the end of the night, the passing of the pain. |
| **Māyā** | माया | Illusion—the magic trick that looks real but ain't. |
| **Svapna** | स्वप्न | Dream—the journey that feels so solid till you wake. |
| **Gandharva-nagara** | गन्धर्वनगर | Mirage—the city in the sky you can see but never reach. |

**The Blues Insight:**
- The Blues "arises" when you pick up the guitar... but did the Blues exist before? It was in the ache, in the history, in the silence. It didn't *come from* anywhere. It co-arose with the need, the hand, the string.
- The song "lasts" while you play... but each moment is already gone. The "duration" is just a label for a string of dyin' notes. You can't find the "song" in any single one.
- The song "ends"... but it echoes on in the listener's ear, and you can play it again tomorrow. The "cessation" is just a change in the pattern, not a jump into nothin'.
- The conditioned nature of life *is* the Blues—the constant, bittersweet flow. But seein' through it, seein' its empty, dream-like nature, is liberation.
