Sünyavada ' 
BY j 
Dr, S. Bagchi 


Chronological Background 
Though Nagarjuna is probably the first systematizer ° of 
Stinyavada which we call the Madhyamikadarsana, it is perfectly 
legitimate to presume that this doctrine was current among the 
Mahayana Buddhists for a long time before his advent, In the 
Buddhist Agamas, viz. the Prajfidpdaramitd, the Lankavatàrasütra 
and others, the doctrine of Sinyatd has been broached and: treated 
of in & laconic and desultory manner, But the Agama is written in 
a diffuse style of the Puranas in which philosophical matters are 
entangled with religious dogmas. It is difficult to draw a definite 
conclusion as to whether it is the doctrine of Sinyavdda or Viüfiana- 
vada that is preached in these works. 10 18 an intriguing matter 
that both the exponents of Vijfidnavada and Sünyavada have drawn 
upon these source books in confirmation ot their philosophical con- 
clusions, The Lankavatára contains long passages which lend coun- 
tenence to the idealistic view that consciousness is the ultimate 
reality, Onthe other hand there are passages in it which have 
definite link with Sinyavdda—Absolute Negativism. These Agamas 
play the same role as the Upanisads in the evolution of the schools 
of the Vedanta philosophy with their uncompromising rivalry. > 
It is also presumable that Nagarjuna may have had predeces- 
sors who tried to systematize the tenets of Sanyavdda in the style 
of professional ee ilosophers, Süngavüda has been discussed and criti- 
cized in the JVyayasütra of Aksapüda.and it is quite natural to 
assume that the doctrine criticized was sponsored by Nagarjuna 
for the first time. Nagarjuna has also quoted from the Nydyasitra, 
In the Vigrahavyavartani he has criticized the Nyaya theory. In 
the state of our present knowledge which is confined to the availa- 
ble works of Nagarjuna and the JVyagasütra, it is not far from risk 
to assign priority or posteriority to these two authors. It is defi- 
nite that the Mahayana schools of Yogacara—Viüjüánavüda and 
Sunjavada were linked into shape in the early christian era, if not 
before, The word Sünyatá or Sünya is also found in the Pali Nika- 
yas, though its connotation is a matter of dispute, We must wait 
, for further light which may be derived from tresh discovery of old 
texts. The chances, however, are very remote. We have to remain 
content with this atmosphere of chronological uncerteinty and to be 
on the safe side, it is expedient to keep our judgement in reserve, -

Madhyamika Philosophy of Nagarjuna 

Let us now consider the Madhyamikakarikad of Nagarjuna. 
It is a pity that the auto-commentary of Nagarjuna called FE 
on his K@rikd and the commentaries of cea ae vue 

: in original. They are preserve in Tibetan trans- 
eg Au Madhya school was latterly divided into Svdtan- 
irika subschool sponsored by Bhivaviveka or Bhavya and the 
Prüsangika school of Buddhapalita and Candrakirti. A fragment 
of Bhayaviveka’s Tarkajvala has been discovered and also Gua 
with an English annotation by Dr. V. V. Gokhale of Delhi Univer- 
sity... From the portions published, it is not easy to deduce the 
philosophical position of Bhüvaviveka. It appears from the article 
of Professor Y. Kajiyama, published inthe Research Publication 
Vol. 1 of Nava-Nalanda-Mahavihara_ that the difference between 
the two Madhyamika schools is more, logical than metaphysical. 
The critical problem concerning the Müdhyamika school is the 
determination ofthe nature and content of Sinyatd. Dr. Satkari 
Mookerjee, the greatest living authority on Indian Philosophy: has 
made this pertinent observation: Candrakirti, the commentator of 
Nagarjuna, whose original work in Sanskrit has come down to us, 
does not seem to leave any loophole to foist a positivistic interpre- 
tation upon the concept of Siinyaid.’ 

The issue ina nutshell is whether SüngatG means absolute 
vnqualified negation or affirmation of a positive reality. Dr. Suzuki, 
Prof. Steherbatsky, and Prof. T. R. V. Murti are of opinion that 
Sü d usual is not a pure voidity. ‘Lhe Yogācāra philosophers such as 
Asahga and Vasubandhu on the contrary have criticized the doo: 
trine of Absolute Negation and assert the reality of transcendental 
consciousness bereft of subject-object polarization. ‘hey call it 
non-dual consciousness ( advayajiidna). It is extremely unsafe to 
voice the hypothesis that Nagarjuna was a Negativist or Positivist. 
Itis however clear that Sünyatà is not regarded by Nagarjuna 
as of the nature of consciousness. Itis detinite that the latter 


orthodox exponents of the Madhyamika doctrine, viz. Candrakirti- 
and Prajüükaramati—the. commentator .. on the Bodhicarydvatara: 
(Chapter 1) are vehemently opposed to the concept of pure con- ` 


tentless consciousness.

Candrakirti’s Prasannapadü was discovered and edited by 
Professor De 19 Vallee Poussin, .He thoroughly exploited the 
Tibetan translation and for the first time presented a materially 
correct text, The edition cf the Madhyamikakarika with Candra- 
kirti’s commentary by the late Saratchandra Shastri was full of 
corruptions. The present text has been prepared by Dr. P L. ' 
Vaidya, the former Director of the Mithila Research Institute on 
the basis of Poussin’s edition. E 

Nagürjuna's Kárikas have been elaboratelyo explained by 
Candrakirti and his commentary is intelligible even to à person 


possessing a modicum of knowledge of Mahiyina Buddhism. It is 


obviously needless to point out that his exposition is to be under- 
stood as that of the Prüsaügika school and its unequivocal mode 
of expression seals the path for palming off a positivistic construc- 
tion on the text, à : 
The matters of historical interest have been touched upon 
by Dr. P. L, Vaidya in his Introduction and it is in the same posi- 
tion of uncertainty as the chronology of older writers. What is of 
central importance to a student of Indian Philosophy is the logical 
assessment of the philosophical position of Nagarjuna, If Candra- 
kirti be a faithful exponent, 10 may be asserted more or less cate- 
gorically that Sinyatd is not a positive concept, Dr. Vaidya has 


‘alluded to the similarity of 80066 and Mdydvdda, I am not so 


categorically sure as Lr. Vaidya seems to be that Sankara's Maya- 
vada is derived from Niagarjuna’s conception of Sinyatd. Rival 
philosophers have censured Sahkara by the designation of crypto- 
Buddhist. The relative positions of philosophers are to be deter- 
mined with a detached mind fiee from ull preconceptions. Sriharsa 
and his commentator Anandapixna have raised the issue of lender 
and borrower. Sankardcdrya has deduced his Mayavada from the 
Vedic sources, lt is quite presumable that he may have exploited 
the arguments of the Buddhist. But Suükara's repugnance to the 
Buddhist doctrine is conspicuous and unambiguous. He has criti-

decay and death’ Negétion is also a false fiction. According to 
him negation is another entity. Candrakirti has made it abun- 
dantly clear that absolute negation with reference to the background 
of a positive entity is unthinkable. It is only a name and & word 
without a meaning. Saükarücürya on the other hand distinguishes 
tha phenomenal world from a fiction and Absolute Reality. The 
world of plurality, both mental and physical is logically indeter- 
minable. He admits empirical and pragmatic validity but denies 
it the nature pf Absolute Reality. Reality is always Absolute 
and Sünyat& is also Absolute. Nagirjuna repudiates that it is 
reality (bhava) and also that itis negative, ^ But the negative 
according to Nagarjuna is always another positive real. Negation 
is relative and, this leads him to deny that Sinyat is pure negation, 
Because that would invest it with a positive character. 


We leave apart the interpretation of modern philosophers, 
It will remain a moot question. But it should be remembered that 
Candrakirti denies the doctrine of triple reality (trisvabhdva) 


In the Madhydniavibhdga, Asanga the putative author of it 
criticizes the, concept of Sinyatd as pure voidity. He posits the 
Ultimate Reality as consciousness. ln the Mahdydnasitralamkara 
there are texts which unequivocally posit an Ultimate Reality of the 
nature of pure .consciousness at the back of phenomenal universe, . 
and this reality is monistic in character and metaphysically 
indistinguishable from the Brahman of the Upanigads. Dignaga, 
Dharmakirti, Sintarakrsita and their later followers are found to 
assert categorically that consciousness is momentary. ‘here are 
good reasons to believe that Dignàga and his school deny the Alaya- 
consciousness. Saùkarācārya has criticized in his commentary on 
the Brahmasiitr the philosophical theory advocated by this school. 
Dignàga's popularity and powerful dialectic threw the old Yogacara 
school of Maitreyanütha and Asanga into utter oblivion. 


We do not consider that the characterization of Sanyata as ` 
& relative validity by Dr. P. L. Vaidya a happy appraisal Relative 
validity is only a euphemism for philosophical invalidity. Whatever 
is found to be relative is dismissed by Nagarjuna as unreal 
appearance. र

Before concluding our brief survey, it may not be out of 
place to reproduce the philosophical appraisal of Stinyavada as 
distinct from Breahmawdda by Sriharsa in his Khandanakhandakha- 
dya. Sriharsa observes that the doctrine of anirvacaniyatá, i. e. 
logical indeterminancy! is not to be confounded with the Buddhist 
doctrine of Sënyatā. The Buddhist regards everything relative or 
absolute as logically indeterminable, whereas the Vedantists believe 
that Brahman is capable of being characterized as the transcenden- 
tal reality and everything else is indeterminate’. sIndeterminency 
and ‘metaphysical unreality are synonymous terms. We again 
reiterate the historical fact that Stnyavada has been criticised by 
all schools of philosophers as the doctrine of pure Negativism. In 
this respect the Buddhist school other than Sinyadada, the J ains, 
and all the Brahmanical schools are unambiguously unanimous. 
A. positivistic interpretation, even if legitimate, would make 
Nagarjuna immune from the attack of his criticó? We do not 
mean to prejudge the issue and leave it to genuine students of 
Mahiiyana Buddhism to draw their conclusions.

INTRQDUCTION * : 
३ 1. The Edition 


This edition of the MadhyamakaSastra of Nagarjuna with the commentary 
called Prasannapada by Candrakirti is mainly based on the one edited by Louis de 


„la Valleé Poussin and published in the BIBLIOTHECA BUDDHICA, Vol. IV, St. Peters- 


burg, Russia, in 1912 (referred to as B in the margin). There was an earlier 
edition of this work, published by BUDDHIST TEXT SOCIETY, Calcutta, in 1897 and ° 
edited by Saraccandra Sastri. This Calcutta edition is full of mistakes, and its 
value is no more than a manuscript in print. It was used by Poussin for what 
it was worth, but he also used two Mss., one from Paris and the other from 


Cambridge. Further, he checked his Text of Karikas as well as of Candrakiri's ` 


commentary with the hele of Tibetan Translations. He added a number of 
useful indices and exhaustive foot-notes, textual and exegetical. Out of his 
notes, textual ones are retained with some modifications by meat the foot of the 
page below the text, while I have made as much use as possible of his exegetical notes 
in my CRITICAL NOTES printed at the end of the Volume. Since Poussin's edition 
was out in 1912, many Buddhist works in original Sanskrit have been printed in 
Europe, India, America and Japan, and I have added references to them in the 
body of my text as well as in Critical Notes. Poussin's edition is long out of 
print. I had the good fortune of studying this very work at his feet in 1921- 
22, and hence I thought it my duty to bring outa new edition with a number of 
additions and alterations, I have made use of additional materialepublished since 
then, and therefore I hope this edition will be more useful than the former to our 
Indian scholars. The foot-notes of Poussin containing Tibetan translation of 
Karikas and of extracts of the commentary have been omitted from this edition 
as they are no longer useful to Sanskrit scholars. I do not, however, underrate 
the value of Poussin's edition, and of extracts from Tibetan given by him, buta 
once the purpose of checking the accuracy of Sanskrit text is achieved, the value 
of Tibetan translations to Sanskrit pandits becomes secondary. 
2. Philosophical Systems under Mahayana 


There are two important philosophical schools of the Mahayana Buddhisnt, 
viz, the Madhayamika School founded by Nagarjuna and his followers, 
Buddhpalita, Bhavaviveka, Candrakirti and Santideva, and the Yogacára School 
founded by Maitreyanatha and his followers Asanga, Vasubandhu, Sthiramati, 
Vimuktisena, Haribhadra etc. Both these schools take Prajfüparamiía 
literature and other Mahayana Sütras as their sacred sources. Acaryas of both 
these schools seem to have written commentaries on texts like Astasahasrika 
with interpretations which would support the special doctrines of their respective 
schools as Samkara, Rāmānuja etc. interpreted Upanisads and the Badara- 
yanasütras differently to support Advaita, Visistadvaita’ etc. We have not yet 
discovered in original Sanskrit any such commentary on Prajfiápáramità from the 
‘school of Nagarjuna, but we propose to give in the present series of Buddhist Sans- 
krit Texts Haribhadra's commentary called Aloka on Astasahasrika which may be 


garded as a specimen of Yogacara interpretation of the Prajfiaparamita 


literature. It may be said here that corresponding to Nagarjuna's Káriküs of 
the Madhyamakagastra, we have Abhisamaydlamkarakarikas from Maitreya- 
natha to explain the Yogacara stand,” .

» vii.: RU MadhyamakaSastra 


- There is ‘one more’ school ‘of the Mahayana Buddhists which cannot be 
accurately called a philosophical school. Itisa school of Logicians headed by 
Dignaga. The writers like Dignága and Dharmakirti specialised in logic; they, 


however, could not escape the influences of the two schools mentioned above, - 


and a majority of them show a strong inclination towards the Yogacara system 
as the Midhyamika school did not give much scope for logical treatment of 
their metaphysics, It will be shown later that the Prisangika branch of the 
Madhyamikas did not give much room to logical treatment as Nagarjuna's 


"n 


` Vigrahavyavartani amply demonstrates. Dignaga, who wrote a short philoso- 


phical treatise in about 57 stanzas , called Prajnüparamitàpindartha, seems 
clearly to follow the Yogácára view as also Dharmakirti. 
3. Origin and Teaching of the Madhyamika School of Buddhists 


The religion founded by: the Buddha got divided into various schools of 


thought andcustoms within a few centuries after his nirvana. The two earliest of : 


these schools‘were the Sthaviravadins and Mahüsamghikas. Their differences 
were due to certain rules of conduct or interpretation of Buddha's teaching. The 
fissiparous tendency did not stop there, and there soon appeared a number of 
them drawing their names either from a locale, or mode of living, or adherence to 
a particular book or tenet. Many of these schools had their own sacred canon, 
complete or partial, which was written in a variety of dialects such as Pali, 
Sanskrit, Prakrit or even Apabhrarh§a. Some of these canons have come down to 
us in these languages, at least in fragments, but many appear to have been lost in 
their original form. This variety of dialects was but natural; for Buddha was a 
native of Kapilavastu, and must have preached in his mother-tongue“ or in 
alanguage which was capable of being understood by natives of Mithila, 
Magadha, Kasi and Kosala in which countries he spent his life as a religious 
teacher. His sermons were rendered by his pupils in their own native tongue, 
from which they were given different standard forms of a language such as 
Pali, Sanskrit, Prakrit and ApabhrarSa. Of these, Tipitaka in Pali seems to be a 
compact canon, but that was not the case with other canons. Improvements in 
linguistic forms as also in doctrinal tenets must have been introduced from time 
to time, and Buddhist literature which is found in dialects of Northern and North- 
eastern regions remaire] scattered. Side by side, there were some changes in 
ideals and ideologies of the original form of the religion due to influences of 
adherents and their pre-occupations. All this resulted in’ forming a new and vast 
mass of literature commonly known as Sütras and written in a language which 
shows an admixture of Sanskrit and: popular or Prakrit forms and idioms. These 
sütras had a vast volume, and there were traces of lack of cohesion in their 
teaching. Among these works, there is a class of literature called Viipulyasitras 
numbering nine and various recensions of the Prajnaparamiia. There is also a 
very large number of sütras known under the class of Mahay&nasütras dating 
from about the 2nd or even 3rd century 9. c. Nagarjuna (2nd century A. D.) 
in his Sgtrasamuccaya draws upon nearly seventy such titles, A large number of 
them seems to iud been lost in their original Sanskrit form, butthey are 
preserved:in their Tibetan and/or Chinese translations.

B in this new form also showed fissiparous tendencies and it was felt 3 


necessary to maintain their strength and unity. To evolve a uniform phil 
phicalsystem from out this vast literature embodying apparently conflicting

views leading to chaos; was a task in the post-Ghristian age before scholars like 


A§vaghosa,. Nagarjuna, Maitreyanatha, Asanga, Vasubandhu and Dignaga. It is ° 


the effort of these scholars which is responsible for bringing into existence two 
:famous philosophical schools of Mahayana Buddhism, viz., the Madhyamika 
- School ‘and the Yogacara School 

Among’ these scholars, Nagarjuna picked up, ‘to name his school, one 
' of the most striking tenets of Buddhism, viz, Madhyama@ or Madhyavnia 
Pralipad, the Middle Path, preached in his first sermon by Buddha, and 
which, consequently, no follower of Buddha could renounce. He -named his 
system Madhyamaka ( मध्यमेव ` मध्यमकम्‌, संज्ञायां कन-पा. ५-३:८७) or Madhyantaka 

$astra, and his followers come to be known as Madhyamika ( मध्यमकमधीयते विदन्ति 
चा-तदघीते तद्वेद-पा. ४० 3. ५९ ). Under this title he codified the contents of this vast 
mass of conflicting sütras so as to yield a philosophically uniform teaching, and 
embodied it in over 400 Karikás in anustubh metre divided into 27 chapters. 
“Tn one of these Kirikas, he explicitly refers to the Kalyayanavavadasiitra, which, 

by-the-bye, is accepted as authority by all Buddhist scholars holding different 


shades of views 

कात्यायनाववादे च अस्ति नास्तीति चोभयम्‌ । z : 

प्रतिषिद्धं भगवता भावाभावविधायिना ॥ ~ 

[म. शा. १५-७] 
On this Candrakirti remarks : 
_ इद च सूत्रं सवेनिकायेघु पञ्चते ( मः शा. १५. ७) rs 
The statement of asti and ndsti, two conflicting, contradictory and extreme 

categories which have been denied by Buddha, recommends or suggests the 
way out of these, which the founder called Madhyama ( मध्यमया wd देशयति ). 
Expanding the concepts of asti and ndsti into bhava and abhava, samsdva and 
nirvana, he evolves a solution negating these extremes, and thus founding the 
Middle Path, Nagarjuna, following this line of thought, classifies the contents 
of the sutras into two classes of tenets, one recommending a view which is 
ultimately to be abandoned, and the other as final and absolute; the one practical 
vyüvahürika, and the other as absolute, final or param@rthika. That this is ther 


ultimate objective of the system of Nagarjuna is clear from the following karika: - र 


2 सत्ये समुपाश्रित्य बुद्धानां धर्मदेशना 
. जोकसंशतिसत्यं च सत्यं च परमार्थतः ॥ [ म. शा. २४-८ J 
Candrakirti, at the end of his commentary on Madhyamaka Sastra, confirms 
the above view when he says :- 

समाप्तं चेदं HARENA सकलछलौकिकलोकोत्तरप्रवचननीतनेयार्थव्याख्याननैपुण्यविशारदमू । 
(MS p. 259 ) 
The system of Nagarjuna thus classifies all discourses of Buddha into 
Nitartha, i. e., absolute or final, and Neyartha, i. e, vyavaharika or practical, and 
arrives at the conclusion that although from the point of lower philosophical 
plane all notions or concepts of worldly existence stand valid, from the point of 
view of higher or absolute philosophical plane, these notions have but a relative 


` _. Validity, and therefore one should reject both existence and non-existence and 


` follow a middle path or relative validity. Nagarjuna says :- 
Š अस्तीति शाश्वतप्राहो नास्तीत्युच्छेददर्शनम्‌

The main anthority fôr this view, of course, is the passage in the 
Katyayanavavadastira admitted as authority by all Buddhists. The passage 


runs :— . 
यदभयसा कात्यायन अयं लोकोऽस्तितां वा अभिनिविष्ट नास्तितां च 1 तेन न परिमुच्यते ।...... 


अस्तीति काऱ्यप अयमेकोऽन्तः । नास्तीति काश्यप अयमेकोऽन्तः । यदेनयोरन्तयोर्मध्यम्‌, RET,

भूपोना भूतप्रत्यवेक्षा (MS p. 118 ) 

The right view of the world thus runs through the two extremes. Therefore, 
when a Madhyamika is categorically asked to state his view-point, he would 
declare the eight Nos: 
अनिरोधमनुत्पादमनुच्छेदमशाश्वतम्‌ । 

अनेक्रार्थतनानार्थमनागमंमनिर्गमम = 
[a शा. 3:1] 

leading ultimately to the doctrine of Pratityasamuipada, of relative or 
dependent origination, which is the first revelation of Buddha on attainment of 
enlightenment, So the Madhyamikas maintain that they alone represent 
correctly the doctrine as propounded by the Buddha. Candrakirti vehemently 
refutes the ch Hd Madhyamika is no better than a Nastika, in this way:—

Nagarjuna does not refer in his Kārikās to any sūtra by name other 
‘than the Kalyayanavavüda; but Candrakirti in his commentary refers to a large 
number of them, and draws on them .profusely in support of each and every 
tenet of the School. » 3 

The method of dialectics to refute the views of the opponent adopted by 
Nagarjuna and his followers like Buddhapalita and Candrakirti is known as the 
Prasaziga, i. e , reducing the opponent to. an absurd position contradictory to 
his accepted views; Bhavaviveka or Bhavya, though belonging to Nagarjuna’s 


school, follows an independent or rational method called Svatenira. Candrakirti, - 


however, holds the view that a Madhyamika as such should not adopt that 
mothod :— 
न च माध्यमिकस्य सतः स्वतन्त्रमनुमानं कठु युक्तम्‌, पक्षान्तराभ्युपगमाभावात्‌ | 
He further says that Nagarjuna himself adopted the Prasanga method in 
his work Vigrahavyavartant as well as in hjs Karikas (see pp. 6-8 ). It is on 
account of this difference in the method of approach that the Madhyamika

school stands divided into two branches, viz, Prásahgikà and Svātantrika 
Schools, Nagarjuna, Buddhapālita and Candrakirti belonging to the former, and 
Bhavya or Bhüvaviveka to the latter. Candrakirti explains the advantages of 
this Prásangika method as follows : 

यो हि यमधै प्रतिजानीते, तेन स्वनिश्चयवद अन्येषां निश्चयोत्पादनेच्छया यया उपपत्त्या असावयोऽधिगतः, 


सैवोपपत्तिः परस्मै उपदेष्व्या । तस्मादेष तावन्न्यायः, यत. परेणैव ल र्थसाधनमुपादेयम्‌+न

दूषणं यदुत स्वप्रतिज्ञातार्थसाधनासामर्थ्यमिति | किमत्र अनुमानबाधोद्धावनया प्रयोजनम्‌ ? ९ 
Nagarjuna in his Vigrahavyavartani (st. 29) states the same view more 
succinctly: — ? 
यकिकाचन प्रतिज्ञा स्यान्मे तत एव मे भवेदोष: ' 
नास्ति च मम प्रतिज्ञा तस्मानैवास्ति मे दोषः ॥ 


It should not, however, be supposed that the Prasangika School is blind to . 
the interests of its followers. It descends to the earthly plane to explain its stand 
asis done in chapter 24 where the absolute and practical standpoints are 
explained. The school also refutes the charge of its being no better than Nastika, © 
as stated above. The main objective of the school is to explain away the apparent 
contradictions in the sütras as recommending practical and absolute stands by 
dividing their contents into nifartha and neyartha, as Sarhkaracarya later did with 
reference to such contradictory statements found in the Upanigads, In other. 
` words, Nagarjuna did exactly for the conflicting statements in Buddhist sütras 
what Sarhkarácárya later did for the Pm isads. I would go a step further and 
say that Nàgarjuna showed the way to arhkaracdrya in this respect. 

There is another doctrinal point in the Madhyamika system which later 
was developed by Sarhkaracarya in his famous Mayavada, It is the introduction 
of the element of Maya to explain away conflicting views. The Madhyamikas 
have but negative statements to make, corresponding to Upanisadic नेति नेति. 
The highest principle of the Madhyamikas corresponding to Upanisadic Brah- 
man is the doctrine of Pratityasamutpada, which at one place is described in the 
following terms :— ®

Or, in the words of Nagarjuna:— . 

: ` अपूरप्त्यय॑ शान्तं प्रपञ्चैरप्रपश्चितम्‌ । 

लक्षणम्‌ ॥ [म. शा. १८.९] 
_ The illustrations which the Madhyamikas used were also subsequently used 
by Samkaracarya. For instance, Nagarjuna says : ` 
यथा माया यथा स्वप्नो गन्धर्वनगरं यथा । 
ययोत्पादस्तया स्थानं तथा भङ्ग उदीरितः ॥ [ न. शा. ७.३४] 
Aryadeva, Nagarjuna’s Pupil, adds a few more :—

धूमिकान्त:प्रतिथुत्कामरीच्यभ्रे: समो भवः ॥

The above extract clearly shows the part which the doctrine of Maya 
plays in the Madhyamika system. It is for the historian of the Advaita Vedanta 
of Sathkaracarya to say to what extent the latter is influenced by the tenets of 
this school. ' ० 

I do not desire to close this brief review of the Madhyamika system with- 
out reference to the doctrine of Stinyatd. This doctrine of Sünyatà, Void, is a 
yery subtle doctrine, and is often misunderstood. Without rightly understanding 
it, there is no emancipation from sarhsdra. This emancipation results from anni- 
hilation of Karma, act, and Kleśa, passion, which, in their turn, have their 
origin in vikalpas, doubts or inaccurate apprehension of the nature of things, which, 
in their turn, spring from prapa"ca. All these are dissolved on realisation of 
this doctrine of Sünyatà :— 


कर्मक्लेशक्षयान्मोक्षः कर्मवलेशा दिकल्पतः | 


ते प्रपचात्पपश्चस्तु दान्यतायां निरुष्यते ॥ [म. शा. १८.५] 
+ This Sunyatà means the Pratityasamutpada, or. conditional existence of all 
things in nature :— : 

यः प्रतीत्यससुत्पादः शल्यतां तां प्रचक्ष्महे | ; 

सा प्रज्ञप्तिर्पादाय प्रतिपत्सेव मध्यमा ॥ [म. शा.२४.१८] 


- leading ultimately to the Middle Path. This middle path advises us to avoid extremes 
of existence and non-existence, because what has a conditional existence, cannot 
be equated with this or tht. 
र प्रतीत्य यद्यद्भचति न हि तावत्तदेव तत्‌। 
न चान्यदपि तत्तस्मानोच्छिन्नं नापि शाश्व॒तम्‌ ॥ ` [म. झा. १८.१०] 
In other words, all objects that. we perceive are §linya, void, because 
they do not possess any element of sign or characteristic of a notion, and 
yet they are accepted by all as self-illumined: 
arr सवेधर्मा निःस्वभावयोगेन । निर्निमित्ताः सर्वधमी निर्निमित्तमुपादाय | अप्रणिद्दिताः सर्वधर्मा 
। प्रकृतिप्रभास्वरा: सरवेधमाः प्रज्ञापारमितापरिशुद्धया ॥ (p. 193) 
At the same time, we should not too much cling to this Sünyatà as the path 
of emancipation or salvation. It should be utilized for the purpose of driving 
away all concepts; if we cling, we are doomed, and incurable: 
UTM सर्वेदीनां प्रोक्ता निःसरणं git: । ; 
येषां तु शन्यता इष्टिस्तानसाध्यान्‌ बभाषिरे ॥ [a शा. १३.८]

बिनाशयति दुर्दशा शन्यता मन्दमेधसम्‌^ 
सर्पी यथा दुर्शृद्ीतो विद्या वा दुष्प्रसाधिता ॥ [ मं. शा. २४.११] 
It is said that Buddha, on'attainment of enlightenment hesitated for a time 

to communicate to the world‘the way of salvation he had just discovered, for 
fear of its not being :rightly: understood (MS. 24.12). Nagarjuna, in his 
Catuksiava, while praising Buddha, has observed :— 

सर्वेसंऋल्पहानाय ` शत्पताम्तदेशना । e 

यश्च तस्यामपि ग्राइस्त्वयासाववसादितः। 

The subtleness of this doctrine and consequent inability of men of Some 
mon understanding, even belonging to the faith of Buddha, has been very cleverly 
brought home to us by Candrakirti in the following passage : z

. 4. Nagarjuna and his Works: 

Nagarjuna is rightly regarded as the founder of the Madhyamika School 
of Buddhists, and must be distinguished from another Nagarjuna whose conttibu:, 
tion is mainly, if not solely, to the field of Tantra inctading Vaidyaka (Chemistry 
and Metals). Mahavyutpatti, 177. 1-2 clearly mentions Nagarjuna and Naga- 
hvaya as two distinct acaryas of Buddhism, at the head of 36 other dcaryas, many 
of whom have left their works tb us. Nagarjuna is also regarded by Hiuen 
Tsang as one of the four suns that illumined the world, the three others being 
Aévaghosa, Aryadeva and Kumaralita. The Chinese tradition makes him a 
contemporary of king Kaniska. Rajataraigini (11th century A. D.) states 
(1.168-77 ) him to be a contemporary of Huska, Juska, and Kaniska:—

x Madhyamaka -Sastra 


For details of the Madhyamika School and its followers, the reader is 
referred to my work ‘Etudes sur Aryadeva et son Catuksataka’, Paris, 1923. 

Tradition also, almost uniformly, makes him a contemporary of Kaniska 
who seems to be friendly to Nagarjuna, and a letter called Suhrllekha addressed 
by Nagarjuna to him also exists in Tibetan translation. It is, therefore, safe to 
assume that Nagarjuna lived in the latter half of the second century A. D. 
Cabout 170-200 A. D. ).. 

According to the biography of Nagarjuna, translated into Chinese by 
Kuiharajiva (circa 405 A. D.) he was born in a Brahmin family in southern 
India, studied, the Vedas, and became ‘well-versed in other Brahmanical 
lores, He was also known as a mighty magician: Bana records a reference to 
Nagarjuna having received a necklace of pearls from a Naga king. : Tibetan 
chronicles almost invariably refer to him as a mighty magician. He had a 
pretty long life of 400 years! All this looks like a legend, and to build up history 
from such records is very difficult. Lankavafarasiitra, a work belonging to 
the Nine Dharmas or Agamas of Nepal, says ( 10. 164-166 ):— 

Pad सुगते पश्चात्कालो्तीतो भविष्यति | 
: 2) महामते निन्रोध त्रं यो नेत्रीं धारयिष्यति ॥ 
दक्षिणापथचेदल्यां भिक्षुः श्रीमान्‌ मद्दायशाः । 
नागाहृयः स नाम्ना तु सदसत्पक्षदारकः ॥ 
प्रकास्य लोके मद्यानं महायानमनुत्तरम्‌। 
= आसाद्य भूमिं मुदितां यास्यतेऽसौ सुखावतीम्‌ ॥ 

One important thing to be noted about the aboye-quoted stanzas is that they 
are found in the 10th and last chapter of the work, This last chapter generally 
puts together the stanzas occurring in the first nine chapters of the sütra, but 
precisely these stanzas are not found in the first nine chapters, and therefore, 
their antiquity and genuineness become questionable. In any case, Nagarjuna 
is associated in them with Daksinapatha, The term Vedali is of uncertain 
significance; it has been confounded with Vidarbha; and so Nagarjuna is made a 
resident or native of Vidarbha. I think we should rather go further south to 

- find out his native land, and it may not be far from wrong to take his associa- 

~ tion with Nagarjunikonda where Buddhist antiquities are recently discovered. 
After his conversion to Buddhism, he went to the North upto Kasmira and made 
a name there. It is said that he spent his last days on Srigaila in modern 
Andhra State. * 

Candrakirti in his Bhasya on Madhymakavatara records a tradition that 
Nagarjuna was an incarnation of Ananda, the famous attendant of Buddha. 
Lesving aside its value as a piece of history, we may take it that Nagarjuna was 
held to be as faithful an interpreter or chronicler of Buddha's teaching as Ananda 
was. Says Candraktrti:- . .

seem to have been composed by another and positively later Nagarjuna, we feel 

certain that philosopher Nagarjuna composed the following works : 

(1) Prajna or Karikas of the Madhyamakasasiva and its commentary called 
Akutobhaya ; 

(2) Vigrahavyavartani and its commentary ; 

(3) Yuktisastika ; 

(4) Sünyatüsaptali and its commentary ; 

(5) Mahayanavimsika ; : N 


(6) Aksarasataka and its commentary ; i 


(7) Pratityasamutpadahrdaya and.its commentary ; 
(8) Catuksiava ; : 
(9) Prajnüparamitastatea (found at the beginning of Astasahasrika) ; 
(10) Bhavanahrama ; 
(11) Sitrasamiiccaya or anthology of Mahayana Sutras; 
(12) Suhrllekha or Arya Nagarjuna Bodhisattva Suhrllekha ; 
(13) Bhavasamkranti; . : 
(14) Rainavali; and ; 
(15) Vaidalyaprakarana. . A 

The. work under the title Dharmasathgraha, which is a collection of 
Buddhist Technical Terms and edited in Anecdota Oxoniensia, Vol. I, part V, is 
attributed to Nāgārjuna in the colophon, but it does not seem to be a genuine 
work of this philosopher, and may be by his later namesake, most probably a 
Hinayanist. : 

Some of the works above mentioned are available in the original Sanskrit, 
but many are still known only from their Tibetan or Chinese translations. 

Taranatha ( Geschichte, p. 71 ) says that adherents of Hinayana ascribe the 
authorship of the Satasahasrika Prajfiaparamita to Nagarjuna, but this does not 
seem likely. The Prajfiápáramità Literature, at least some works like Pancavi- 
mati and Astasahüsrika were already in existence. The ascription may be due 
to the confusion between Prajna which figures as an alternative title of 
Madhyamakasastra Karikà in Tibetan tradition and Prajna@paramiia. In fact, ° 
Nagarjuna has codified the contents of Prajfidparamita literature and other 
Mahäyänasūtřás in his KG@rikas, as Badarayana codified the teaching of the 
Upanisads in his SarirakesWiras. | ; 

Of the 122 works found in Tohoku Catalogue under Nāgārjuna or Klu- 
sgrub or Nagàrjunagarbha, the most important and genuine works of the philo- 
sopher have, been mentioned in the above list, Other works are minor and 
belong more or less to the class of Tantras.

Aryadeva or Deva is mentioned as his direct pupil, who is the author of 
Catulsataka, Hastavalaprakaranya and a few minor works, Among his 
successors and commentators, we may mention Buddhapalita, Bhavya or Bhava- 
viveka and Candrakirti. Of Budhapalita we have only his commentary on 
Madhyamaka$astra found in Tibetan. Bhavya or Bhavaviveka seems to be 
more prolific than Buddhapalita. He.wrote, in addition to the commentary on 
MadhyamakaSastra, called Prajfiapradipa, and some handbooks on the 
Madhyamika system, viz, (1) Madhyamakaratnapradipa (2) Madhyamaka

known only from Chinese translation ( Nanjio No. 1237, recently restored into

*  -Taranatha (XXVI) and following him Schiefner (p. 174) mention that 
Devasármà wrote a commentary on MadhyamakaSastra called Sifabhyudaya 
to 0 tute the views of Candrakirti. The Sanskrit original is not available, nor 
there is any trace of it in Tanjur or Kanjur. 

But of all commentaries on the Madhyamakasasira the most important one 
is the Prasannapada of Candrakirti. He was tlie fellower of the Prasangika 
school of the Madhyamikas and claims to have interpreted the Karikas truly to 
bring out the views held by Nagarjuna. He has referred to the commentaries of 
both Buddhapalita and Bhavya, and refuted the views of Bhavya at places. His 
commentary is truly Prasannapada, and in point of view of elegance of style, is 
a forerunner of Samkarácárya's Bhasya on the Brahmasütras. I have given above 
some extracts. from his commentary, which will convince the reader of his 
remarkable qualities of argument. ‘He cites in support of his views numerous 
extracts from Mahiyinasdtras. Like Bhavya, he also wrote a few handbooks 
on the Madhyamika system, viz. (1) Madhyamakavatara, a work in six chapters 
in verse with his own Bhisya on it; (2) Madhyamakaprajnavatara; (3) 
Pancaskandhaprakarana, besides commentaries on Nagarjuna’s Yuktisastika and 
Snnyaidsaplati as also on Aryadeva's CatubSataka, Except his Prasennapada 
and fragments of his commentary on CatuhSataka, all other works are preserved 
only in Tibetan translations. SC 

Santideva, the author of Siksasamuccaya and Bodhicayavatara and Prajna- 
karamati are the only two noteworthy writers of the Madhyamika School after 
Candrakirti.

संस्करण GRO जा वेळी पूसे द्वारा संपादित तथा विन्छिओषिका बुद्धिका ग्रंथ ४ (सेंट पीटर्स-, 
बी, रूस, १९१२ ) के रूप में प्रकाशित ( हाशिये में “13: चिहसे अंकित ) संस्करण\पर 
मुख्यतः आधारित है | इस रचना का इसके पूर्व का और एक संस्करण श्री ER शात्री के 
संपादकत्व में बुद्धिस्ट टेक्स्ट सोसाइटी, कलकत्ता द्वारा १८९७ ई० में ' प्रकाशित हुआ 


या | कल्कत्तेवाछ यह संस्करण नुटियों से भरा हुआ है, अतः इसका मूल्य छपी पांडुलिपि ` 
से अधिक नहीं माना जा सकता | पूसें ने उसके मूल्यानुसार उस संस्करण से काम लिया - 


था, किन्तु और दो पांडुलिपियो को भी वे काम में छाये थे, एक पैरिस वाळी और दूसरी 


केंब्रिज वाळी 1 इसके अलावा कारिकाओं के मूछपाठ तथा चंद्रकीर्ति की टीका की जाँच 


उन्होंने तिब्बती अनुवादों के आधार पर की थी । आपने कई उपयुक्त अनुसूचियाँ भी ^ 


समाविष्ट की थीं, तथा पाठविषयक और शाख्षार्थविवरणात्मक प्रभूत पादटिप्पणिय भी | इन 


टिप्पणियों में से पाठसंवंधी टिप्पणियाँ कुछ परिवर्वनो के साथ मैंने मूलपाठ के नीचे उद्धृत 


की हैं, और विवरणात्मक टिप्पणियों से भी पुस्तक के अंत में दी हुई अपनी टिप्पणियों में 
यथासंभव छाम उठाया है। १९१२ में जब यह संस्करण प्रकाशित हुआ, तब से लेकर 
आज तक बहुत से बौद्धधर्मविषयक संस्कृत ग्रंथ युरोप, अमेरिका, भारत, जापान जैसे 
देशों में उप चुके हैं । उन सवका उल्लेख पाठान्तरो में तथा अपनी ठिप्पणियों में मैंने किया 
है । पूरे का संस्करण SF अरसे से अप्राप्य रहा है। सन १९२१-२२ में इसी ग्रंथ का 
अध्ययन आप ही के चरणों में बैठकर करने का सौभाग्य मुझे मिला था। अतः इसका 
पुनःसंस्करण करना मैंने अपना कर्तव्य माना, और कुछ संशोधन, कुछ उचित परिवर्तन करके 
अब उसे प्रकाशित करने जा रहा हूँ | इस संस्करण में मैने अद्ययावत्‌ प्रकाशित सामग्री 
का यथेष्ट उपयोग किया है, अतः मुझे आशा है कि यह संस्करण भारतीय पंडितों को 
पहले से अधिक उपयोगी fg होगा । पूसे के संस्करण में जो, कारिकाओं और टीका के 
अंशो के तिब्बती अनुवाद, पादटिप्पणियों में समाविष्ट थे उन्हें मैंने हटाया है, क्योंकि 


तथा उनके तिब्बती उद्धरणों का मूल्य मैं बिल्कुल कम नहीं मानता । लेकिन संस्कृत पाठ 
की शुद्धता की जाँच का काम संपूर्ण हो जाने पर तिब्बती अनुवादों का मूल्य संस्कृत 
पंडितों की दृष्टि से नगण्य रह जाता है | :

उनके अवि ga, भावविवेक) चंद्रकीर्ति तथा शांति-देव द्वारा स्थापित तथा

विकसित, और दूसरा योगाचार मैत्रेयगाथ और उसके अनुयायी असंग, quen, स्थिर- 
मति, विमुक्तिसेन, हरिभद्र आदि द्वारा स्थापित | दोनों संप्रदाय ग्रज्ञा-पारमिता साहित्य तथा 
अन्य महायान सूत्रम्रंयो को अपने पवित्र आधार-ग्रंथ मानते हैं। दोनो संग्रदायों के आचार्यो 
ने अएसाहस्रिका जैसी रचनाओं पर टीका-ग्रंथ रचे हैं, जिनमें अपने अपने संप्रदाय के 
विशेष सिद्धान्तों की पुष्टिपरक अर्थ-स्थापनाएँ उन्होंने की हैं, जैसा कि शंकराचार्य, रामानुजा- 
sed आदि आचार्यो ने प्रस्थानत्रयी पर अपने अद्वैत, विशिष्टाद्वैत आदि सिद्धांतों को पुष्ट 
करने के लिए भाष्य रचकर किया है । प्रज्ञापारमिता की नागाजुनीय संप्रदाय की टीका आज 
मूल संस्कृतमें उपलब्ध नहीं है । परंतु अष्टसाहस्रिका पर हरिभद्रविरचित आलोक 
नामक टीका का प्रकाशन वौद्ध संस्कृत ग्रंथमाला के इसी ग्रन्थमें ही. मैने किया | यह 
टीका-प्रंथ प्रज्ञापारमिता साहित्य पर यौगाचारिक व्याख्या का नमूना माना जा सकेगा । 
नागार्जुन-प्रणीस मध्यमकशाल्न-कारिकाओं के समकक्ष यौगाचारिक संप्रदाय का विवरण 
मैत्रेयनाथ विरचित अभिसमयालंकारकारिका में मिलता दै, ऐसा भी कहा जा सकता है। 

महायान पंथ की और भी एक शाखा विद्यमान है, पर वह दार्शनिक शाखा नहीं 
कहला सकती | वह नैयायिको का एक संप्रदाय है, जिसके प्रधान प्रणेता हैं दिड्नाग | 
Ream, धर्मकीर्ति आदि विद्वान्‌ न्यायशाल्न में विशेषज्ञ हुए E, तोभी उपरिनिर्दिष्ट दोनों 
संप्रदायो के आध्यासिक दर्शन के प्रभाव से वे अहूते नहीं रह सके | उनमें से अधिकांश 
नैयायिकों का झुकाव योगाचार-दर्शन की तरफ स्पष्ट WIA दृग्गोचर होता है। इसका 
कारण यह है कि माध्यमिक संप्रदाय के अध्यात्म-दर्शन में न्यायसंगत विवेचन के लिए कम 
गुंजाइश दिखाई पड़ती 2.1 आगे चढकर यह दिखाया जायगा कि माध्यमिको की 
प्रासंगिक शाखा में तर्फसिद्ध विवेचन को अवकाश नहीं दिया गया है | नागार्जुन की 
रचना विग्रहव्यावर्तनी इस वात की साक्षी है । प्रज्ञापारमितापिंडार्थ नामक .अपनी ५७ 
छोकवाली दार्शनिक रचना में दिइनाग योगाचार सिद्धान्त का ही अनुसरण करता हुआ 
नजर आता है, उसी प्रकार धर्मकीतिं भी । | 

३, Rat का माध्यमिक दर्शनसंग्रदाय — उद्गम-तथा सिद्धान्त। 

महात्मा बुद्ध के परिनिर्वाण के बाद कुछ शताब्दियों में ही विचार तथा आचार को 
लेकर बुद्धप्रणीत धर्म अनेकों शाखा-प्रशाखाओं में विभाजित हुआ | इन शाखाओं में सबसे 
प्रथम निकळी हुई दो शाखाएँ स्थविरवादी और महासंधिक नाम से विज्ञात हैं | इस 
विमेद या तो आचारभिन्नता के कारण निर्माण हुआ, या तों के अर्थ निर्धारण के कारण |

नाम या तो किसी स्थानविशेष्र को छेकर दिये गये थे या आचारविशेष को; या तो किसी 
ग्रंयविरोष के अनुसरण दे; कारण या किसी तत्त्व-विशेष के | इनमें से अनेक शाखाओं के

होने के कारण बुद्धने अपनी मातृभाषा में धर्मोपदेश किया ही होगा, तथा काशी, कोसल, 
मिथिला, मगध आदि जिन जिन प्रदेशों में धर्मप्रचार के लिए आपने संचार किया, उन उन 
प्रदेशों के निवासी जिस जिस भाषा को समझ पाते थे उस उस भाषा में भी घर्मेपदेश 
किया होगा | उनके प्रवचन उनके शिष्योंने अपनी अपनी भाषा में अवतरित किये होगी, 
जिनके आधार पर आगे चळकर परिनिष्ठित भाषाओं को प्रयोग में लाकर .पांढी, संस्कृत, 
प्राकृत तथा अपभ्रंश तक में उनका व्यक्तीकरण हुआ होगा | इन सबमें पाळी तिपिटक

पश्चिमोत्तर प्रदेशों की भाषाओं में पाये जानेवाला बौद्ध साहित्य बिखरी इई अवस्था में रहा | 


साथ ही साथ अनुयायियों तथा उनके पूर्वमतों के प्रभाव से आदशौँ तथा तत्त्प्रणाळियों - 


में भी परिवर्तन अवश्यंभावी थे | इन सब के फलस्वरूप ' सूत्न-साहित्य ” नाम से एक विशाल 
साहित्य बन गया, जिसकी भाषा लोकभाषा और प्राकृत के रूपों और मुहावरों के संमिश्रण 
से प्रभावित संकर-संस्कृत भाषा थी । इन सूत्नोंका विस्तार a विशाल था, इस लिए उनके 
उपदेशों में एकता के अभाव के चिह ट्र्गोचर थे । इन रचनाओं में वैपुल्यसूत्र 
नामक नवसंख्याक रचनासंग्रह और प्रज्ञापारमिता के विविध रूपान्तर विद्यमान हैं। 


अन्य विशाल सूत्रसंग्रह “ महायानसूत्र” नाम पर ईसापूवे दूसरी और तीसरी भी शताब्दी - 


से विद्यमान है । नागार्जुन ( लिस्तोत्तर दूसरी शताब्दी ) ने जो सूत्रसमुच्चय नामक 
संकलन तैयार किया, उसमें उन्होंने छगभग ७० Gaal का परामश किया है । इसमें से 


` अनेक सूत्रप्रंथ अपने मूळ संस्कृत रूप में अनुपलब्ध हैं, तो भी तिब्बती और चीनी अनु- , 


वादों में सुरक्षित पाये जाते हैं | 

इस नये रूप में बौद्धधर्म में विधटनग्रद्ृत्तियाँ दीख पड़ीं | इस लिए उसकी शक्ति 
तथा एकता बनाये रखना आवश्यक प्रतीत हुआ | इस दृष्टि से खिस्तोत्तर युग में अश्वघोष, 
नागार्जुन, मैत्रेयनाथ, असंग, geh, दिड्नाग आदि पंडितप्रवरों के सामने एक महत्त्वपूर्ण 
आवश्यक कार्य यह था कि इस सब विशाल साहित्य के परस्पर विरोधी मतमतान्तरो में से 
समन्वय-स्वरूप एक दार्शनिक प्रणाळी विकसित की जाय | इन बिहद्व्यों के अथक परिश्रमों 
का परिपाक ही महायान पंथ के माध्यमिक तथा योगाचार नाम से विख्यात दो संप्रदायों के 
प्रणयन के रूप में हमें उपलब्ध है। | e 

इन पंडितों में नागार्जुन ने अपने संप्रदाय के नामकरण के लिए बुद्ध के प्रथम 
प्रवचन में समुपदिष्ट सर्वश्रेष्ठ प्रभावी तों में से एक मध्यमा यी मध्यमा ग्रतिपद्‌ का 
अवलंबन किया | इसी कारण कोई भी बुद्धानुथायी इसे त्याग न सका | अपनी सिद्वान्त-

मध्यमक शास्र नाम दिया । अतः उसके अनुयायी माध्यमिक नाम से ख्यात हुए | 
( मध्यमकमधीयते विदन्ति वा,-तदधीते तद्वेद-पा. ४-२-५९ ) दार्शनिक दृष्टि सै समन्वित 
तत्तोपदेश उपल्ब्ध करने के हेतु नागार्जुन ने परस्परसंघर्षयुक्त इस विशाल सूत्र-साहित्य 
का संहितीकरण इस नाम से किया, औरे अनुष्टुभू छन्द॒ की ४०० से अधिक कारिकाओं 
में, जो २७ परिच्छेदों में प्रविभक्त हैं, इसे मूर्तिमान्‌ किया | इनमें से एक कारिका में उन्होंने 
सप रूप से कात्यायनाववाद सूत्र का उल्लेख किया है, जिसे सभी मिन्नमतावलंवी बौद्ध 

पंडितोंने प्रमाणभूत माना है | 
. कात्यायनाववादे च अस्ति नास्तीति चोभयम्‌ | 
८ Maite भगवता भावाभावविधायिना ॥ ( म. शा. १५.७) 
इस पर चंद्रवीर्दि का कहना है: -- ; 

° इदे च सूत्रं सर्वनिकायेषु पठ्यते ( म. शा. १५-७ ) 

(अस्ति ? तथा नास्ति ” दो ऐसे विधान हैं जो अन्योन्य-बिरोधी चरम स्थिति 
हैं, जिनका निधेध बुद्ध ने किया है | इनसे छुटकारा पाने का मार्ग सुझाकर उसे संस्थापक 
द्वारा मध्यमा नाम दिया गया है ( मध्यमया धर्म देशयति ) | ' अस्ति? और ' नास्ति’ का 
विस्तार ' भाव ? तृथा * अभाव ? और “ संसार ? तथा ' निर्वाण ' में बतळाकर इन . चरम 
स्थितियों के निषेध द्वारा समस्या का हल विकसित किया गया है, और मध्यम मार्ग की 
स्थापना की गयी है। इस विचार-सरणी का अनुसरण करते हुए नागार्जुन ने सूत्रों के 


आशय को दो भागों में विभक्त किया है । एक में ऐसी धारणा का निर्देशन किया है जो 
अंत में त्याग दी जाएगी, और दूसरे में चरम अटळ सत्य का । पहला व्यावहारिक सत्य हैं, .. 


और दूसरा पारमार्थिक सत्य | नागार्जुन की सिद्धान्तसरणि का यही चरमोदिष्ट सत्य निम्न उद्धरण 
से स्पष्ट हैः. ` a E 
2 सत्ये समुपाश्रित्य बुद्धानां धर्मदेशना | 
लोकसंबतिर्सत्यं च सत्यं च परमार्थतः ॥ (म. शा. २४. ८) 
मध्यमकशाख्टीका के अंत में उपर की स्थापना का? अनुमोदन करते हुए चंद्र- 
कीर्ति कहता है:- : : |

विशारद्म्‌। ( म. शा. 9. २५९ ) : 
नागाजुन का संप्रदाय इस प्रकार वुद्ववचन को दो विभागों में वर्गीकृत करता है- 
१ “ नीतार्थ” या पारमार्थिक, २ ' नेयार्थ? या व्यावहारिक | उसका चरम साध्य यह है - 
यद्यपि दर्शन के निन्न स्तर पर यानी व्यवहार के धरातल पर संसार-विषयक सब धारणाएँ 
सत्य हैं, तोमी दर्शन के उच्च स्तर पर विचार करने पंर उनकी सत्यता केवळ सापेक्ष 


है, इस लिए * भाव? और ¦ अभाव ? की स्थितियों का निराकरण करके मध्यम-मार्ग. यानी. 


सापेक्ष सत्यता का अवलंब करना ठीक होगा | नागार्जुन कहते हैं -

इस स्थापना का प्रमुख आधार सत्र बौद्धों के ढिए प्रमाणभूत कात्यायनाववादसत्र 
के निम्न उद्धरण में मिळता है:-

नागार्जुन अपनी कारिकाओं में कात्यायनाबवाद को छोड़कर और किसी सूत्र का 
#नेर्देश नहीं करते, लेकिन चंद्रकीतिं अपनी टीका में अनेकों सूत्रों का निर्देश करता है और 
"e से प्रचुर उद्धरण संप्रदाय के प्रत्येक तत्त्व की पुष्टि के लिए देता है। 

पूर्वपक्ष की धारणाओं का खंडन करने के लिए जो बिबादःपद्धति नागार्जुन तथा 


, उनके अनुगामी बुद्धपाळित, चंद्रकीर्ति आदि पंडितोंने अपनायी है वह प्रसंग नाम से ज्ञात 


है। प्रसंग कः अर्थ है पूर्वपक्षी को तर्कदुष्टता के भैर में. खींच कर उसकी निजी धारणाओं 
के विरोध में छा पटकना | भावविवेक अर्थात्‌ भव्य नागार्डुन के संप्रदायनिष्ठ होकर भी

न च माध्यमिकस्य सतः स्वतन्त्रमनुमानं कलु युक्तम्‌ , पक्षन्तराम्युपगमाभावात्‌ | (प्र. ५) 

वह आगे चलकर कहता है कि नागार्जुन ने अपने ग्रंथ विग्रहव्यावर्तनी में और 
कारिकासंग्रह में इसी प्रसंगपद्धति को अपनाया है । बिवेचनपद्धति की इस भिन्नता के 
कारण माध्यमिक संप्रदाय की प्रासंगिक और स्वातंत्रिक नाम से दो शाखा 
इई | पहली के समर्थक नागार्जुन, बुद्धपाळित तथा चंद्रकीतिं रहे, और दूसरी के भव्य या

साथ यों कहते हैं :- 
“ यदि काचन प्रतिज्ञा स्यान्मे तत एव मे भवेद्दोष: |

लेकिन यह मानना उचित नहीं होगा कि प्रासंगिक संप्रदाय अपने अनुयायियों के 


हित के संबंध में वेफ़िक है । व्यवहार के धरातळ पर उतरकर वह अपनी स्थापना सिद्ध .

किया हुआ पाया जाता है | नास्तिकता का den भी उपरिनिर्दिष्ट मार्ग से इस संप्रदाय ने

किया है । सूत्रों में स्थित विरोधाभासात्मक बचनों का विरोधपरिहार द्वारा समन्वय करना इस 
संप्रदाय का प्रमुख उद्दिष्ट रहा | इस लिए दो धरातळ सुझाये गये- १ पारमार्थिक-नीतार्थ . 
तथा २ व्यवहारिक-नेयार्थ, जैसा कि आगे शंकराचार्य ने उपनिषदू-त्राक्यों के वारे में कहा 
है। दूसरे शब्दों में यह कहा जा सकता है कि उपनिषदीय विरोधाभासात्मक वाक्यों का 
समन्वय करने के लिए शंकराचार्य ने जो किया, वही सूत्रों मैं विद्यमान विरोधाभासों के बारे 
में नागार्जुन ने किया था बल्कि यह कहना ठीक होगा कि नागार्जुन ने शंकराचार्य का मागी 
सुकर कर दिया। | 
और भी एक सैद्धांतिक तत्त्व माध्यमिक संप्रदाय में है, जो आगे चलकर शंकराचार्य 
द्वारा अपने प्रसिद्ध मायावाद के रूप में विकसित किया गया । वह है विरोधी वचनों का 
समन्वय करने के लिए “माया-तत्त” का अंगीकार । उपनिषदों के “ नेति? “नेति? ”

किन्तु अष्टसाहल्तिका प्रज्ञापारमिता (कलकत्ता संस्करण Yo ३९, हमारा संस्करण Yo २०) 
का निन्न उद्धरण माध्यमिकों का दृष्टिकोण बिलकुळ स्पष्ट कर देता है:

xxiv मध्य़रमकशास्त्र 


अथ खलु देवपुत्रा आयुष्मतं सुभूतिमेतदवोचन-सम्यक्संबुद्धोईप मायोपम; स्वप्नोपम 
इति, सम्पक्ंबुद्धत्वमपि मायोपमं स्वप्नोपममिति आर्यसुभूते वदसि? सुभूतिराह-निर्वाणमेपि

<नेर्वाणं च अद्वयमेतदद्रै्ीकारमिति | (p. 196 ) 

" इस उद्धरण से यह स्पष्ट है कि माध्यमिक संप्रदाय में मायातत्त का वया स्थान है।. 
शंकराचार्य-प्रणीत अद्वैत वेदान्त के इतिहासलेखक का यह काम है कि माध्यमिक संप्रदाय 
के इन तत्तां का अद्वैत वेदान्त पर कहाँ तक प्रभाव पड़ा है यह देखे | 

माध्यमिक संप्रदाय का यह संक्षिप्त विवरण शून्यता-सिद्धान्त का निर्देश किये बिना 
समाप्त करणा मैं नहीं चाहता | यह शून्यता-तत्त्व अत्यंत सूक्ष्म है और अनेक वार गलत 
समझा जाता है। विना उसे ठीक ठीक समझे संसार से मुक्ति असंभव है | कर्म और 
ga ( वासना ) के उन्मूलन से मुक्ति ग्रा होती है। कर्म और छेश विकल्पों से यानी 
वस्तुस्वरूप की श्रान्त धारणा से उद्भूत होते हैं । यह श्रान्त धारणा प्रपञ्च से उद्भूत 

- होती है । इस प्रपञ्च का निरास शून्यता-तत्त्व के अवबोध से हो जाता है - 

क्ह्केशक्षयान्मोक्षः कर्मङ्केशा विकल्पतः | 
ते प्रपञ्चाठ्पश्चस्तु शून्यतायां निरुध्यते || ( म. शा- १८:५ ) 
यह शून्यता ही प्रतीत्य-समुत्पाद या वस्तुमात्र का सोपाधिक अस्तित्व है: 
यः ग्रतीत्यसमुत्पादः शून्यतां तां प्रचक्ष्महे | 
सा प्रज्ञसिरुपादाय प्रतिपत्सैत्र मध्यमा || ( म, शा. २४-१८ ) 
और यही अन्त में मध्यम मार्ग को छे जाता दै । यह मध्यम मार्ग ही अस्तित्व नास्तित्व की 
' अन्तिम स्थितियों को दूर रखने का उपदेश देता है, क्योंकि जिसका अस्तित्व ही सोपाधिक 
है वह किसीसे तुल्य नहीं बताया जा सकता :--- 
प्रतीत्य यद्यदू भवति न हि तावत्तदेव तत्‌ | 
न चान्यदपि तत्तमाननोचछिन्नं नापि शाश्चतम्‌॥ (म. शा. १८.१० ) 
अन्य शब्दों में जो जो वस्तु हम देखते हैं, शून्य है, क्योंकि उसमें न धर्म का स्वभाव 
है, न चिह है, न लक्षण है । उस पर भी उसे स्वयंप्रकाशित माना जाता है: - 
शूत्या: सधर्मा निःस्वभावयोगेन । निर्निमित्ताः gih निर्निमित्तमुपादाय | अप्रणि- ` 
हिताः सधर्मा अप्रणिधानयोगेन | प्रकृतिप्रभारवरा: सर्वधर्माः प्रज्ञापारमितापरिशुद्धया। a 33) 
तथापि मुक्तिमार्ग के नाते इस झूत्यता के साथ ज्यादा चिपके रहना ठीक नहीं । 
सन आन्त धारणाएँ निरस्त करने के लिए ही उसका उपयोग करना उचित होगा। यदि 
हम इसी पर निर्भर रहें, तो हमारी अवस्था असाध्य ही समझिये :--- |

शून्यता aidi प्रोक्ता निःसरणं Ta: । ` 
येषां तु शून्यता इष्िस्तानसाध्यान्‌ बभाषिरे || (म. शा. १३-८) 
यही नहीं, अगर शून्यता के स्वरूप को समझने में भ्रांति हो गयी, तो वह मानव 
को नष्ट कर डालती है, जैसे ठीक रूप से न पकड़ा गया साँप या अपूर्णसावित मंत्रविद्या 
साधक के विनाश का कारण बन जाती है :--- 
विनाशयति दुर्दश शून्यता मन्दमेघसम्‌ | 
सर्पो यथा दुर्गृहीतो विद्या वा दुष्प्रसाधिता ॥ (म. शा. २४-११ ) 
कहा जाता है कि बुद्ध सम्यक्‌ ज्ञान के आविर्भाव के वाद कुछ काळ तक अपना 
पाया हुआ मुक्तिमार्ग दुनिया को समझाते हुए हिचकिचाये, इस विचार से कि दुनिया उसे 
ठीक ठीक समझ सकेगी या नहीं | (म. शा. २४-१२ ) नागार्जुन अपूने चतुःस्तव में 
बुद्ध की स्तुति करते इए कहते हैं: - र 
. _ सर्वसंकल्पहानाय शून्यतामृतदेशना | 
यश्च तस्यामपि म्राहस्त्वयासाववसादित: || 
इस तत्त्व की सूक्ष्मता तथा सामान्य जनता-चाहे वह बुद्धानुयायी भी क्यों न हो-की 
उसे समझ लेने की अक्षमता चंद्रकीर्ति ने निम्न उद्धरण में चतुरता से समझा दी B:—

e ४ नागाजुन तथा उनकी ग्रंथरचना — 
नागार्जुन को A के माध्यमिक संप्रदाय का प्रवर्तक ठीक ही माना जाता है। 
एक अन्य नागार्जुन है, जिसने प्रमुखतः तंत्र तथा वैद्यक ( रसायन और धातु ) के क्षेत्र 
में Age लेखन किया है। इससे आचार्य नागार्जुन को पृथकू समझना ही चाहिये | 
महाव्युत्पत्ति ( १७७.१-२ ) में स्पष्ट निर्देश मिळता है कि नागार्जुन और नागाहय 
दो मिन्न बौद्ध आचार्य हैं, जो अन्य ३६ आचार्यों के शिरोमणिभूत विराजते हैं। इन सबमें से 
अनेक आचायौं से हमें ग्रंथ प्राप्त इए हैं। हुएन्संग ने भी नागार्जुन को धरती को 
, प्रकाशित करनेवाले चार सूरयो में से एक माना है । वाकी तीन सूर्य हैं अश्वघोष, आर्यदेव 
और कुमारळात । चीनी परंपरा के अनुसार नागार्जुन को कनिष्क के समकालीन माना 
जाता है । राजतरंगिणी (११ वीं शताब्दी) कहती है ( १-१६८-७७ ) कि वह 
gem, gun, एवं कनिष्क के समकालीन थेः-- १ 
अथाभवन्‌ स्वनामाङ्कपुरत्रयबिधायिन्‌ः |

माध्यमिक संप्रदाय और उसके अनुयायियों के विषय में अधिक जानकारी प्राप्त करने 
dp लिए देखिये मेरी रचना : Etudes sur Aryadeva et son Catubáataka 
Ra १९२३ ' । | 
भारतीय परंपरा भी लगभग समान रूप से उन्हें कनिष्क का समकालीन मानती आयी है। 
. कनिष्क के साथ नागार्जुन की गाढ़ी मित्रता भी दिखाई देती है। नागार्जुन का कनिष्क के 
नाम लिखा. हुआ एक पत्र सुहृछेख भी तिब्यती अनुवाद में पाया जाता है। इस लिए 
इतना तो वेखटके माना जा सकता है कि क्षिस्तोत्तर दूसरी सदी के उत्तरार्धमें ( छगभग 
१७०. से २०० ई. ) नागार्जुन का जीवन-काळ रहा।  . 
` . कुमारजीवढिखित चीनी अनुवाद में उपलब्ध नागार्जुन की जीवनी के अनुसार 
~( ४०५ ई. ) उनका जन्म दक्षिणभारत के Qm ब्राह्मणकुल में हुआ | वेदों का अध्ययन

करके अन्य ब्राह्मणीय विद्याओं में वह निष्णात हो गये | वह एक सिद्ध मांत्रिक के रूंप में 
भी विख्यात ये | किसी नागराजा से मोतियों का हार उन्हें ग्राप्त हुआ था इस बात का 
उल्लेख वाणमट्ट ने किया है | तिब्बती इतिहासं-सामग्री में उन्हें अविच्छिन्न रूप से सिद्धहस्त 
मांत्रिक माना गया है | उनकी आयु gÂ ४०० साळ की बतायी गयी है। यह सब 
किंवदन्तियौ जान पड़ती हैं । ऐसी सामग्री से अधिकृत इतिहास बनाना कठिन है। नेपाळ के ˆ 
नौ धर्मों या emm का ग्रंथ लंकावतारसूत्र वताता है (-१०-१६४- १६६ ) :-- .

एक महत्त्वपूर्ण बात ऊपर उद्धत Set के बारे में यह है कि वे उस du के 
दसवें यानी अंतिम अध्याय में मिळते हैं | प्रायः दसवें अध्याय में प्रथम नो अध्यायों के 
शोक इकट्ठा किये जाते हैं| लेकिन ठीक ये शोक ही ऐसे है जो पहले नौ eremi में नहीं मिळ्ते । 
अतः उनकी प्राचीनता तथा सत्यता शंकास्पद है । जो भी हो, इन ोकों में नागार्जुन का संबंध 
दक्षिणापथ से बताया गया है। “ वेदळी ' पद का अर्थ अनिश्चित है | उसे भ्रम से विदर्भ मानकर 
उसको नागार्ुन का जन्मस्थान या निवासस्थान बताया गया है । मेरी घारणा है कि उनका 
जन्मस्थान खोजने हमें और दक्षिण की तरफ जाना पड़ेगा | नागार्जुनिकोंडा से उसका 
संबंध जोड़ना सत्य से दूर नहीं होगा । यहाँ हाल ही में बौद्धधर्म के प्राचीन अवशेष खोज 
में मिळे E बौद्धधर्मस्वीकार के वाद वह उत्तर की तरफ कइमीर तक गये और adi 
उन्होंने नामबरी भी हासिल की | कहा जाता है कि उन्होंने अपने अंतिम दिन आज के 
आन्ध्र राज्यांतर्गत श्रीशैल में विताये। 
नागार्जुन के नाम पर ' तंजुर ” और ' कंजुर * में बहुत सी रचनाएँ बतायी जाती 
हैं, जिनकी संख्या १२२ से कम नहीं ( देखिये ठोहोकु सूची ) । यह संख्या तंत्र और 
वैद्यक ( आचार्य नागार्जुन भाषित अवमेषज कल्प - टोहोकु सं. 9३०८ ) के nd को 
छोड़कर है | इन तंत्र - वैद्यक ग्रंथों में से अधिकांश का कर्तृत्व किसी दूसरे, स्पष्टतया बाद मैं 
हुए, नागार्जुन का हो सकता है | हमारा विश्वास है कि दार्शनिक' नागार्जुन की निम्नलिखित 
रचनोएँ नि:संदिग्ध हैं: --- 
(१) “प्रज्ञा! या मध्यमकशाख की कारिकाएँ और उसकी टीका अकुतोभय; 
(2 ) विम्रहव्यावर्तनी और उसकी टीका 
(३ ) युक्तिषष्टिका 
(४) शुन्यतासप्तते, और उसकी टीका

(५ ) महायानविंशिका ; 
(६ ) अक्षरशतक .और उसकी व्याख्या; 
(७) प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादहृदय और उसकी टीका; 
(८ ) चतुःस्तव; : 
( ९ ) प्रज्ञापारमितास्तोत्र; 
(१०) भावनाक्रम; 
(११) सूत्र-समुच्चय यानी महायान सूत्रों का संग्रह; 
(१२) सुहल्लेख या आर्य नागार्जुनवोधिसत्त UO; 
- (१३) भवसंक्रान्ति 
(१४) टत्नावळी ; और 
(१५) वैदल्य-प्रकरण 
८ धर्मसंग्रह नामक रचना, जो बौद्ध पारिभाषिक शब्दों का संग्रह है ( अनेक्डोटा 
ऑक्झोनिएँशिया जिल्द-१ भाग ५ में संपादित और जो पुस्तक के अंत के संकल्प में 
नागार्जुन लिखित वतायी गयी है, इस तत्त्वज्ञ की असली कृति नहीं प्रतीत होती । उनके 
बाद के किसी और नागार्जुन की हो सकती है, जो कि संभवतः हीनयानी हो | 
उपरिनिर्दिष्ट रचनाओं में से कतिपय मूल संस्कृत में उपलब्ध हैं, किन्तु वाकी 
रचनाएँ तिब्बती और चीनी अनुवादों से ही ज्ञात हैं । 
तारानाथ (Geschichte V. ७१ ) कहते हैं कि हीनयानियों ने शतसाहत्तिका 
ग्रज्ञापारमिता का कर्ता नागार्जुन को वताया है, छेकिन यह संभवनीय नहीं माद्धम होता | 
प्रज्ञापार॒मिता - वाड्मय -- पंचविंशति और secrete जैसी “रचनाएँ --- पहले ही से विद्य- 
मान था | तिब्वती परंपरा में मध्यमकशासत्रकारेका के वैकल्पिक नाम ‘nar? तथा 
^ “प्रज्ञापारमिता? में जो शब्दसाइश्य है उसीके कारण यह भ्रम संभव दीखता है | वास्तव में 
नागाजुनने प्रज्ञापारमिता वाझाय तथा अन्य महायानसूत्रों का संहितीकरण अपनी कारिकाओं 
में किया है जिस प्रकार बाद्रायण ने उपनिषदों की शिक्षा का द्ारीरकसूत्रो. में । 
नागार्जुन या (Klu-sgrub) नागार्जुनगर्म के नाम पर टोहोकु सूची में 
निर्दिष्ट १२२ रचनाओं में से महत्त्वपूर्ण और असली रचनाएँ ऊपर की सूची में समाविष्ट 
हैं | अन्य रचनाएँ अग्रधान तथा अधिकांश तंत्रविषयक हैं। 


८, नागार्जुन और उनकी शिष्यपरंपरा 
आयंदेव या देव नागार्जुन का खास व्यक्तिगत अंतेवासी बतळाया गया है | उसकी 
रचनाएँ हैं चतुःशतक, हस्तवालप्रकरण, और कतिपय छोटी रचनाएँ | उनके उत्तराधिकारी 
टीकाकारों में बुद्धपाटित, भव्य या भावविवेक, तथा चंद्रकीति के नाम बताये जा सकते 
हैं। बुद्धपालिति की एक ही रचना मध्यमकशाख की टीका तिब्बती में प्राप्त है । उसकी 
अपेक्षा भव्य या भावविवेक की रचना अधिक बिपुठ है । प्रज्ञाग्रदीप नामक मध्यमकशास्र

की टीका के अतिरिक्त उसकी माध्यमिक सिद्धान्त - विषयक कई रचनाएँ हैं, जिनके नाम ये 
हैं; — १. मध्यमकरलप्रदीप २. मध्यमकहृदय --- तर्कज्वाछा टीकासंवलित ३. मध्यमकार्थ- 
संग्रह ( तीनों तिब्बती अनुवाद में प्रात); 9. करतळरत्न चीनी, -अनुवादसे ज्ञात हाळ में 
संस्कृत, में रूपान्तरित ( Nanjio ऋ-१२३७ ); ५. निकायमेदविभंगव्याख्या, बौद्ध धर्म 
की १८ शाखाओं का विवरणः और ६ तत्त्वामृतावतार ( ऊपर क्रमांक 9 में दो बार 
निर्दिष्ट 1 i 

तारानाथ और उनका अनुसरण करते हुए शिएफनर (प्र. १७४) कहते हैं कि 
देवशर्माने मध्यमकशालत्र पर सीताम्युद्य नामक टीका छिखी है, जिसमें चन्द्रकीर्ति के 
मतों का खंडन किया है। मूल संस्कृत रचना अप्राप्य है, और उसका निर्देश तक ' तजुर' * 
या “कंजुर में नहीं मिळता] | 

सध्यमकशास्न पर जो टीकाग्रंथ रचे गये हैं उनमें सबसे महत्त्वपूर्ण चंद्रकी्ति-कत 
प्रसन्नपदा है। चंद्रकीर्ति माध्यमिकों के ' प्रसंग संप्रदाय ” का अनुयायी था। उसका दावा 
है कि नागार्जुन की स्थापनाओं का आशय संचाई के साथ समझाने का सफळ प्रयास 
उसने कारिकाओं की टीका में किया है | बुद्पालित और भव्य की टीकाओं का उल्लेख 
उसने किया है, और कई स्थलों में भव्य की मान्यताओं का खंडन भी किसा 2 | उसकी 
टीका यथार्थ ही प्रसन्नपदा है, और झैळी की प्रसन्नता की दृष्टि से वह शंकराचार्य के 
ब्रह्मसूत्रभाष्य की qdadi पथ-निर्देशिका है | ऊपर इस टीकाके कई उद्धरण दिये गये हैं, 
जिनसे पाठक उसकी विवेचनरैळी की झाँकी पा सकते हैं | अपनी स्थापनाओं के पुष्ट्यर्थ 
उसने महायानसुत्रों से पर्याप्त उद्धरण RA हैं । भव्य के समान ही उसने माध्यमिक संप्रदाय 
पर छोटी छोटी पुस्तिकाएँ लिखी हुं ( १) मध्यमकाबतार-पद्यमय षडध्यायी सटीक 
रचना; (२) मध्यमक-प्रज्ञावतार; (३ ) पंचस्कंध प्रकरण | इनके अलावा उसने 
नागार्जुन कृत युक्तिषष्टिका और शून्यतासप्तति पर तथा आर्यदेवविरचित चतुःशतक पर 
टीकाएँ भी रिखी हैं। ग्रसन्नपदा तथा चतुःशतक-टीका के कुछ खंडों को छोडकर बाकी 
सब रचनाएँ तिब्बती में सुरक्षित हैं। 

चंद्रकीति के वाद माध्यमिक संप्रदाय के लेखकों में दो ही नाम उल्लेखनीय है - 
(१) शिक्षासमुचयय तथा बोधिचर्याबतार का कर्ता शांतिदेव और ( २ ) बोधिचर्यावतार 
का टीकाकार प्रज्ञाकरमति।

Dr. K. P. Jayaswal and Rahula Samkrtyayana from a single Ms. procured from 
Tibet by the latter. It was also translated from Tibetan by DreG. Tucciin GOS. , 

I have included this text here with slight but obvious improvements for 
the simple reason that it is a manual of the methods of reasoning of the Madhya o 
mika School of Buddhists, written by Nagarjuna, the founder and chief master 
of the system. Candrakirti refers not only to this text, but also to its commentary .. ० 
by Nagarjuna (vide pp. 6, 8, 9). Thus the work being a genuine work"of "the 
author of Madhyamaka Süstra, and manual of Madhyamika methodology, I 
thought that it should be in the hands, of the reader of Madhyamaka Sastra., It 
should be noted further that, under Stanza 28 of this work, Nagarjuna quotes 
his own Karika from MŚ., viz., MS. 14.10 with words यथोक्तम्‌, indicating thereby 
that at least the commentary of Vigraha Vyavartani was composed by him after 
MŚ., introducing the stanza by the phrase: न हि व्यवहारसत्यमनाभित्य शक्या धर्मदेड्ाना

[This Appendix contains the available portion of the text of Ralndvali 
or Ratnamala which seems to me a genuine work ‘of Nagarjuna. The work 
is attributed to Nagarjuna by Candrakirti, who, in his commentary on MS. 
cites as many as 23 stanzas from the available portion of this work. One stanza 
from this text is identical with MS. 3. 7. ‘This available portion was edited by 
Dr. G. Tucci and published by him in JRAS, London, 1934, 1936. He 
` promised to restore. into Sanskrit the 'missing portion from its Tibetan 
translation, but so far I have not seen it. 


In Tohoku Catalogue No. 4158 the work is called राजपरिकथा-रत्नमाला. It has 
also a Commentary by Ajitamitra ( T 4159). 


The Ratnavali or Ratnamülà is a work belonging to the class of Lekhas 
like Suhrilekha attributed to Nagarjuna or ‘Sisyalekha of Candragomin. The' 
work is addresssd to a king, who, according to Commentator, is Sataváhana. 
On the other hand, itis said that Suhrilekha is :addresed to king Kaniska. 
Jayaswal thinks him to be Gautamiputra Yajñaśri who reigned between 
166-199 A. D. We find several references, e. g., in 1. 2, to a king to whom 
the work is addressed. The fourth chapter is called राजदृत्तेपदेश. ]

CRITICAL NOTES . a 

Page 1. The correct TITLE of this work of Nagarjuna is मध्यमक, OF मध्यमक- 
शात्र, It consists of over 400 karikas divided into 27 chapters, The present edition 
includes also the Commentary called Prasannapadá by Candrakirti. Poussin 
uses the title माध्यमिकवृत्ति which later he corrected to सध्यमकइत्ति, Even now scholars 
loosely cite this work as mafea. As explained in the Introduction the name 
of the work is मध्यमक or सध्यमकशाल्न, and name of the Commentary on it 18 प्रसन्नपदा, 

Page 1, Line 2--योष्न्तद्वयावासविधूतवास: is an epithet of नागाजुन who has thrown 
to winds the stand of resorting to two extreme views. These antas are अस्ति and 
नास्ति; शाश्वत and उच्छेंद; संसार and निवोण etc. We find the mention of these antas in 
numerous places ‘in almost identical terms as for instance in Samyutta Nikaya, 
III. 135 : सब्ब अत्थीति...अय एको अन्तो । सब्बै नत्यीति अयं दुतियो अन्तो । एते ते कचान उभो अन्ते 
अनुपगम्म मज्झेन घम्मं देसेति--अविज्जापचया संखारा, ete. Compare also theCom. on MS. 15. 7 
as given on page 118. The reading यो$्न्तदेयावासविधूतवासः, found in Mss. but not 
confirmed by T, may be interpreled as अन्तर्दयाया वासेन विधूतः वासः गह येन, 

Page 1. 1. 3--सद्धमंतोयस्य गसीरभाव...जगाद, who preached the depth of the 
ocean-waters of true law. The reading सदमैकोषस्य found in T is equally good., , 

Page 1, 1. 9-उत्तानसठ्रक्रियवाक्यनद्धां, equipped with phrases which are उत्तान, clear 
or easy to understand, सत्रक्रियवाक्य, with phrases based on right etymological sense. 
तर्कोनिलाव्याकुढितां, not overwhelmed by breeze of तके, reasoning. Note that the name 
of Bhavaviveka’s Commentary on MS. is तकज्वाला, flame of the fire of reasoning. 
प्रसन्ना, characterised by clarity of word and sense. Compare प्रसादस्तु स्वच्छता शब्दार्थयो :. 

Page 1, 1, 10 MARÌ. e., मध्यमकम्‌ or मध्यमकशाल्नम्‌; Cf. p 13, ॥ p. 240, 1. 16 »also

मध्यमकावतार which is the work of the commentator Candrakirti. oa 

Page 1, 1, 11-अद्ययज्ञानालंकृत etc. Nagarjuna composed his मध्यमकशाज् for th 
benefit of persons in order to teach them the अद्वयज्ञान, th? doctrine of identity of 
प्रतीत्यसमुत्पाद, AAA, Hale and मध्यमा प्रतिपत्‌, Compare : 

CLE यः प्रतीत्यससुत्पाद: शून्यतां तां प्रचक्षमहे। 
सा प्रज्ञप्तिष्पादाय प्रतिपत्सैवै मध्यमा ॥ [ म° uo - २४.१८ ] 

Page 1, 1. 12-प्रथमचित्तोत्पादं तथागतज्ञानोत्पतिहेतुम्‌› the cause of obtaining the 
knowledge “श्नोधि ? of तथागत, is the first Rim. There are ten cittotpádas corres: 
ponding to ten bhümis of तथागत. For details, see शिक्षासमुचय and गण्डन्यूहसूत्न 
( मैत्रेयविमोक्ष ). 

Page 1, 1. 13-विदिताविपरीतत्रज्ञापारमितानीतेः, Nagarjuna, who knew the correct 
* interpretation of the class of works going under the name ,०(*प्रज्ञापारमिता. This 
epithet clearly shows that Nagarjlina, in his मध्यमकशाज़, wants 00, codify the 
teaching of sR. ° >> : EE 

Page 1. 1. 15 The term im is to be derived fromm two rgots, viz., शास्‌ 4o rule, 
and Q to protect. “Mhs stanza is also cited on page 4 by स्थिरयति in his मध्यान्त- 

विभागसूत्रभाष्यटीका, with reading च for वः. E ` 


Page 2, 1. 1- अनिरोधमनुत्पादम, etc. These two Kārikās, which, according to : 


Candrakirti, constitute the म composed to salute the तथागत at fie beginning 
of his work by नागाजुन. Poussin does not count these stanzas as forming part of 
मध्यमकशरा्नःand hence does not mmber them, while I take them to be a parts of 
- the work and have numbered them as on page 4. 9 T eos

Page 2, 1. 4—This work aims at explaining the doctrine of प्रतीत्यसमुलाद 
‘characterised by the eight ‘epithets, viz. अनिरोध, अनुत्पाद, अनुच्छेद, अशाश्वत, अनेकार्थ, 
अनानार्थ, अनागम and अनिगम, all negative:terms:meaning devoid of निरोध/ destruction 
etc. LJ 

Page 2, 1. 10--स्थाणःः, eternal. mg also means the same. L. 12— उपसर्गवशेन 
भात्वर्धविपरिणाभात, the meanings of roots undergo changes on account of prefixes. The 
following stanza is also cited by स्थिरसति in his Commentary on मध्यान्तविभाग, 9. 5. 
Note Particularly the second line which in Paninian school is प्रहाराहारसंहारविहरपरिहारवत. 

Page 2, 1. 16—The term प्रतीत्यसमुत्पाद is here derived from प्रति + इ and 
सम््‌+उद्‌+ पद्‌. The part प्रतीत्य is a Gerund and means प्राप्ति ४70 अपेक्षा, and ससुत्पाद 
means birth, prodGction; so the meaning of the entire expression is production 
or origination dependent on certain conditions, or in short, dependent origination, 

Page 2, 1. 18. Another explanation of the term प्रतीत्यससुत्पाद is cited 

- here which is: प्रति प्रति इत्यानां RaRa? ससुत्पादः, production of objects which 
perish again and again, which explanation suits certain passages cited here. 
In भभिधर्मकोराब्याख्या this explanation is attributed to भद्म्त श्रीलाम. Here it is : अन्ये 
पुनरिति भदन्तश्रीलाभः । प्रतिवाप्सार्थं इति । नानावाचिनामधिकरणानां सर्वेपां क्रियागुणाभ्यां व्याप्तुमिच्छा 
aca, तामय॑ प्रतिद्योतयति | इती गतौ साधवः इत्माः। तत्र साधुः [un v. v. ९८] इति यत्रत्यः ।

ग्रतीत्यसमुत्पादः । न कश्चिद्धम एक उत्पद्यते, सहोत्पादनियमात्‌- 

Candrakirti, however, does not like this method of deriving the term, 
particularly in passageslike ay: प्रतीत्य रुपाणि च उद्यते चक्षुविज्ञानमू, as this explanation | 
does not convey the sense of वीप्स. Further, if we take the word इत्य as ending in a 
तद्वितप्रत्यय यत, which then is not an indeclinable, and hence cannot form a compound 
with समुत्पाद, Hence, the commentator holds that his explanation, ४४. हेतुप्रत्ययापेक्षो 
भावानामुत्पादः प्रतीत्यसमुत्पादार्थः, is the right one, है

Page 1, 1. 6-In Mahayana system the entire univérse is divided into three a 
spheres of existence, viz, (1) Kamadh@tu—the sphere of desire, (2) ‘ripadhatu— 
the sphere of form and colour, and (3) àrüpyadhatu- the sphere of formless and 
colourless Beings: Asáhgain his Yogacarabhümi (73) has made the following 
observations: trayo dhatavah. Kamadhatd rüpadhatur arüpyadhatür. iti. He 
has furnished an elaborate account of these three spheres of eyistence. The ३ 
word traidhituka frequently occurs in the Lanka and it has been explained : z

asamskrta (uncreated) objects, viz. ether (ākāśa), annihilation through reflection 
(pratisamkhya-nirodha), and annihilation without reflection ( apratisarnkhya-ni« 
rodha). That what passes under the name of pratisamkhya-nirodha, is equivalent, 
to nirvana. It is worth noting that the Lankavafara hgs enumerated the names 
of akaéa, apratisarnkhyd-nirodha, and nirvana-dhatu (instead of pratigamkhya- 
nirodha) as unproduced things. Cf. 4kSgam apratisamkhyanirodho nirvanadhatus-

Pratyaya : Cause. There is divergence of opinion regarding. the precise 
import of the two technical terms helu and pratyaya so frequently employed in 
Mahayána literature. A section 6! glossators holds that the immediate or proxi- ` 

- mate cause is called etu and that the.remote one passes under the narne of 

pratyaya. While another group of Mahayanists have indigcriminately used them, 
thus indicating identXy of their meaning. Nagarjuna in his Madhyamaka-Sastra 
has set down four different varifies of pratyayas, viz. (1) hetu-pratyaya, (2) alam- 
bana-pratyaya, (3) anantara-pratyaya and (4) adhipati-pratyaya. Candrakirti in his = 
Prasannapada (26) has explained these terms in extenso. He has observed that 
what brings a thing into existerice ag an underlaying seed is to be regarded as hetu- X 
pratyaya with respect to its effect. A thing while coming into existence depends

upon a basis and thereby actually comes into existence. This basis is called 
@lambana-pratyaya. For instance, mind and -all possible varieties of 
mental things are contingent on form and thelike for their coming into being. 
'The destruction of the cause is the immediate cause of bringing the effect into 
existence. To take a concrete instance, the destruction of the seed is the immedi- 
ate cause of bringing the sprout into existence. The destruction of the seed is 
called anantara-pratyaya with respect to the sprout. An effect comes into 
existence due to the existence of another. The latter is styled adhipati-pratyaya 
in reference to the former. Asanga in his Yogacárabhümi (PP. 61-62) has made 
the following observation: Catvarah pratyayah hetupratyayah samanantarapra- 
tyaya alambanapratyayo'dhipatipratyayah. Tatra bijar hetupratyayah. Samanan-

P. 59, L.1-samskrta. That which, is subject to originiation, annihilation and 
mutable existence is technically called samskrta, Prasannapada has elucidated the 
meaning of this term in conformity with the text. The Dharmasamgraha (32) has

Satkayadrsti, heretical notion regarding the reality of the physical body. « 
The Dharmasamgraha has enumerated five different types of heretical 
doctrines : cf. Pafica drstayah. Satküyadrstih, antagrahadrstih, mithyádrstih, 
drstiparamarsah Silaparamar$ah. 

P. 227-Pratipanna ( Pali Patipanna) have attained or practised. 

P. 227—Dharmanudharma = (Pali dhamanudhamma ). There is divergence of 
opinion regarding the exact meaning of thiscompound word. One section of scho- 
lars holds that it signifies the religions doctrine in its entirely. Whereas another 
group avers that it means both principal and subordinate religous docrines. It is 
also occasionally split up as dharmasya anudharmak, thus assigning separate € 
meaning to the final member of the compound. 

P. 227-pratipatti = realization, appropriate behaviour. . ° 

P. 227-UpadhiSesa-nirvina. The expression upadhi implies the five 
skandhas which serve as the substratum of worldly existence and account for 
the notion of the self. This variety of nirvana implies abandonment of the 
six afflictions viz. attachment, anger, conceit, ignorance, evil heretical notion 
and doubt. In this state of nirvana only the five conglomerations yemain » 
as a residuum. There takes place the elimination of the heretical view regard- 
ing the reality of the physical body and other varieties of afflictions. 

Nirupadhigesa-nirvana. This variety of nirvaga implies the annihilation of 
even the five skandhas in the shape of a residuum as adverted to above. To be 
explicit; the sopadhiSesa-nirvana occurs with the cessation of all afflictions and the 
Nirupadhisesa is occasioned by the destruction of even the five conglomerations. 

P. 231. ajavamjavibhüva, the state of coming and going: the cycle or 
series of birth and death. Candrakirft has offered the following interpretation of 
this word: Tatra ajavarhjavibhavah ágamanagamanabhávajanmamaranaparam 
pare’tyarthah 

P. 240. Supina, dream cf. Skt. svapna and AMg. suvina. confer also supana 
and suvanz in this connection. The Lankavatara has repeatedly compared this 
phenomenal world with dream in order to emphasize its -unreality. cf Maya- 
svapnopamarh drSyarh vijfiaptya na vikalpayet ( 265.11 : 95.127, 148 ; 268.35.) 

P. 238- dvadasanga, twelve fold causation, twelve links or steps of causes 

P. 238,1. 2- Pratipad = path. cf. madhyama pratipad the doctrine of middle 
path. It is so-called because it steers clear of the two extfeme doctrines, viz. of 
extreme asceticism and materialism. Nagarjuna in the introductory verse of his*

9 expressions refer to four arya-satyas or four Noble Truths. The Pali equivalent 
to ‘it is ariya-sacca. The authoritaive ° Buddhist texts have enumerated four 
different varieties of it, viz. suffering (duhkha ), cause or origin of, suffering. 
( duhkhasamudaya ), annihilation of suffering ( dukkha-nirodha ); way of 
annihilation (marga). The Arthaviniscaya-sttra, 6, has laid down the four 
noble truths in'the following order: Tatra है catvary árya-satyüni ? 
. tad yatha-duhkham üryasatyam. Duhkhasamudayam üryasatyam. 
Duhkhanirodham aryasatyam. Duhkhanirodhagamini pratipada dryasatyam....

has enumerated them in the way indicated below: Catvary drya-satyani. Tad

P. 238, 1. 10-(punar- ) bhava, state of existence, birth. 

P. 238,1. 10—avidya= ignorance $ Candrakirti has offered the following in- 
terpretation. of this “term : Tatra avidyà ajfidnam tamo yathabhitarthapraccha- 
dakam. Jtis by depending upon ignorance of previous birth that a person 

“performs meritorious, demeritorious and immobiling deeds which ultimately 
leads to rebirth, : E SNC

` P. 238,1. 11-ablisainskurule, produces ( Candrakirti) ; cf. abhisamskaroii : 
This word frequently occurs with karman and citta in the Mahayana Buddhist 
Texts. So its’ meaning varies with the variation of the context. When it is 
' employed with the former itsignifies accumulates, performs, accomplishes and the 
like. ° It is often syiitactically related with its accusative which is permitted to 
play the role of the cognate object. Similarly in the case of its connection with 
the latter, it means concentrates : cf. also abhisamskara. UN 


* . P.238,1. 13— ànejya, This word has often times been used with samıskāra, 
Karman, dharma, and citta. It means immovable. Candrakirti in his Prasanna- 
pada ( P. 143) has made his relevant observation : Karmani kusalakusalanefi- 
jyani. Ir the present context he has interpreted the term samskara as synonym of 
karman itself. Confer his observation... ... ...abhisamskaroti utpadayati.........

e varieties of karman, viz. meritorious ( kusala ), non-meritorious ( a-ku$ala) and 
immovable ( @ezjya): His interpretation of the word samskara coincide with 
that provided by the Salistambasitra ( 81.5 ) which runs as follows : abhisarhs- 
kürárthena sashskargh. The three varieties of Karman alluded to above also 
bring about the three distinct states of existence viz. Kümavacara, riipavacara and 
arüpavacára in order dt their mention. 


P. 238, sariskára, predisposition. It is the result of the performance of 
न” meritorious and: non-meritorious déeds and also is the latent trace of past 
„experience. If is the condition of a new state of existence. Jt is the second link 

८ in the chain of dependent origination ( pratityasamutpada ). It takes its rise by” 
depending on ignorance ( avidya ) and by “itself is the cause of consciousness

the former is susceptible of a threefold classification, viz. Kusala( meritorious ), ^ 
a-kusala; ( non-meritorious ) and immovable (@nejya). It is also liable to be 
set forth in the following order : physical (kayika ), vocal ( vacika ) and mental 
( manasika ) The transmigration of a creature is conditioned by these sarnskaras 
produced by ignorance. cf. te ca trividhah—kuSala, aku$alà, anejyd$ ca yadi và

avidyanivrtah pudgalah karoti. Tai$ ca samskdarair abhisamskrtaih karmabhih 
karmasamijfiitaih tad dhetukarh gatim gacchati ( Prasannapada, P. 238 ) 

vijfidna, consciousness. It is the third link in dependent origination and 
comes into being by depending on samsk@ra. It has been stated ad siauesum that 
performance and the consequent accummulation of action brings about a'state 
of existance, thus facilitating the rebirth of a creature in it. There are accredited 5 
varities of it which are liable to be classified under two distinct heads, viz. ~- 
blessed state of existence ( sugati), and evil state of existence ( durgati ). The 
former. includes the state of existence pertaining to gods (deva) and man 
( manusya ).- The latter relates to that of hell ( náraka ), lower animals ( tiryak ), 
departed spirits ( preta ) and demons (asura). It is worthy of remark that the 
state of existence is conditioned by the nature of samskara, which js either 
blessed or evil as adverted to above. And it is into this state of existence that 
consciousness which hasaction or accumulated predisposition of the previous 
birth for its cause enters, that is.to say, comes into being, as the eeed of 
transmigration. The cycle of birth and death recurs in-an order that has no 
beginning and the twelve links of dependent origination extends over the past, 
present and future existence. And consequently in the process of rebirth of a* 
creature, this consciousness enters the womb of the mother. It is immediately ` = 
after its entrance, that name ( nàma ) and form e ) come into existence in the 
womb by depending upon it (consciousness). To be more precise, the 
consciousness of the foetus is produced by the predisposion of the previous birth, 


nama-riipa, name and form. Itis the fourth link in the chain of dependent 
origination. Itisimmediately after the entrance of consciousness. in the foetus, 
that name and form come into existence by depending upon -it ( consciousness ) 
It is consciousness which brings abóut the association with them. Jt stands to 
reason that the different embryonic stages of the foetus which receive distinct 
name ars form presupposes the existence of consciousness. ‘They are immediate 
successor of it. > 


Candrakirti has furnished the etymological meaning of these two terms. He) 
has observed: Tatra karmakleSaviddham ... ... ndmayatitiandma, sarhjnavagena

» their respective six sense-objects. Cf. DvadaSayatandni, CaksuhSrotraghránajihva:

" the ayatana has been classified under two heads, viz. (1) Vahya and 

(2) üdhyülmika The Lankavatara and other authoritative Mahayana texts 

have frequently mentioned dyatana in association with dhals,and skandha. Cf. 

skandhadhatvayatanünsm parikalpitalaksanasvabhavavabodhah-Lanka, 2.29. 

- P. 243 — upayasa, mental affliction or distress: mental irritation, disturbance 
(BHS, 146). It is the final step in the twelve-fold causation. The Artha- 
viniscayasutra (5) has laid down the preceeding links of it in the following order : 
Jati-pratyaya ° jara—marana — Sokaparideva — duhkha - daurmanasyo'payasah 
sembhavanti. The Dharmasamgraha (42 ) also has provided an identical list, 
Candrakirti has offered the following interpretion : duhkhadaurmanasyabahutva- 
sambhita npāyāsāh. . - 

P. 243 — duhkha, daurmanasya — Candrakirti has clearly stated the differ- 
ence between the meanings of these two words. The appearence of pain with 
respect to the five sense—organs is called duhkha. And the coming about of 
disagreeable state of mind is known as daurmanasya. cf. Paficendriyasatanipato 

Suhkham. Manonistanipato daurmanasyam (Prasannapada, Pp. 243-44). 

EA P. 247 — Manasi-kara,—attention, concentration of mind. In the sacred 
texts of the Buddhist, the word manasi which is loc. sing. of the stem mansas has 
been frequently associated with the different forms of the root kr. cf. manasi- 
karoti, manasi-karoti, manasi-kurvanti, manasi-kuru, manaskára, manasi-karta- 
vya, manasi-krta, manasi-kusvanasya manasi-karisyanti. Besides the two words 
yonisah and ayoni§ah frequently preceed the two words manasi-kara and manas- 
kara. Asanga in his Yagacorabhzmi (60) has made the pertinent observation : 
manaskarai katamah?cetasa abhogah. Besides he has expounded the signi- 
ficance of-the two technical terms : yoni$o manaskdraprajfiapti ( Ybh., 114)

drsti, heretical or erroneous view. This word frequentlyzoccurs in the Lankapa- 
fara, cf. Lanka 3. 1. drstivigatam ; 25.26 bhavadrstih ; 30.67 svabhavah kalpana kal- 
pyam dréyarh drstidvayarh katham ? (V, 67) ; tirthyadrsti (Lanka. P. 23) antadvaya- 
drsti 51. 12) P. 23-aya-vyayadrstabhiniveSena ... ... ....2 (Lanka, 174. 12). 
The Dharmasamgraha ( 68) has made the following observatio: pafica drsta- 
yah. Satkayadrstih, antagráhadrsti, mithyadrstih, drstiparámarsah, silaparamarsah, 
Candrakirti (P. 235) has observed that there are four views with reference to 
niryana: (1) A Tathagata is born after death, (2) A Tathagata is not born after 
death, (3) A Tathagata is both born and is not born after death, (4) A Tathagata 
is neither born nor is not born after death. Besides he,has referred to four 
views pertaining to the annihilation and the like. (P.235) They may be sét forth 
in the following order: (1) The world-order is destructible, (2) The world- 


order is non-destructible, (3) The world-order is both destructible and non-des- ` 
tructible, (4) Verily the world-order is neither destructible nor non-des#ructible. १ 
These four views are to be understood with respect to the future time. When an ° 


individual does not perceive the future coming-into-existence of the self or the 
world-order, he imagines that the world-order is liable to destruction. And he 
pursues this course by relying upon the future time. Analogously when he 
perceives the origination of that what was in future, fie adopts the course that the 
world is non-destructible. When he *both perceives and fails to perceive, he 
concludes in both ways. And due to the negation of both, he comes to hold that 
itis neither destructible nor non-destructible. 2 

Besides there are four views concerning the existence of the world-order iu 
the past. They may be set down in the order indicated below : (1) The world- 
order is eternal, (2) ‘The world-order is non-eternal, (3) The wozld-order is 
both eternal and non-eternal. (4) The world-order is neither eternal nor non- 
eternal: ‘These four views relate to the past time.\ (P. 235), When an 
experient perceives the past origination of the self or the world-order, he reaches 
the conclusion that it (world-ordtr ) is eteranal. But when he cannot perceive 
it, he thinks it to be nca-etrnal. “But when he both perceives and fails to 
perceive, he concludes that it is both eternal ahd nometernal. But when he 
neither perceives ०७1७115 to perceive, he considers it to be neither eternal, nor 
non-eternal. These views corftera with the past time. (P, 235) 

Furthermore, Candrakirti ( P. 249) has set forth eight views pertaining to the 
past time. ‘Fhey are susceptible of classification in the followifig order: (1) 
Were I existent-in the past time 2¢ 2)I yas not existent in the past time, (3) 
I was both existent and nongxistént in the past time C ] Verily I was "either

existent nor non-existent in the past time. Besides the other four views concern- 
ing the eternality of the world-order in the past time have already been adverted 
to above. Candrakirti has remarked that the four-fold view as elaborated in 
connexion with the eternity of the world-order in the past, does rot differ 
from that of the latter to an extreme point. Yet it has been separately . set 

. down by relying-upon their apparently distinctive feature. The view that the 

_ world-order is eternal does not differ from the view I was existent in the past 
time to an inordinate degree. Or, the difference between them may be accounted 
in the following way. The view the world-order is eternal relates to the past time 
in a universal way. But the view I was existent in the past arises exclusively 
with'respect to the past existence of the self. Jt is bereft of any element of 
universality. This attitude should be adopted with regard to the other view. So 
itis evident that these eight views pertain to the past time. 


+ There are also eight views divided under two categories that take the future 
time into its tonsideration. The one category of the four-fold view may be 
«tated in the following order :(1) Shall I be existent in the future, (2) I shall not 
be existent in the future, (3 ) I shall be both existent and non-existent in the 
futuee, (4) Verily I shall be neither existent nor nonexistent in the future. All 
these four views relate to the future time. Over and above there is also four- 
fold view which concerns itself to the destructibility and non-destructibility of the 
world-order andthe mode of its expression has been referred to above. : The 
salient feature of it consists in the fact that it takes course by depending upon the 
future time in a general way. But the view I shall be existent in the future time 

proceeds on by resting upon the future existence of the self.to the exclusion of 
any otier thing. This is the difference between the categories of four-fold view 
that concerns itself with the future time. (PP. 249-50). `
