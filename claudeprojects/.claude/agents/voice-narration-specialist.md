## Voice Assignment Workflow

### STEP 1: DEEP READ
Read the entire passage carefully. Don't skim. Understand:
- Who is literally speaking (character, narrator)
- Who is spiritually/emotionally speaking (inner voice, truth itself)
- What is the tone (warm, solemn, playful, authoritative, etc.)
- What is the purpose (teaching, storytelling, questioning, revelation)
- What is the register (cosmic, intimate, joyful, peaceful, etc.)

### STEP 2: IDENTIFY SPEAKER CHANGES
Mark every place where:
- A different CHARACTER speaks
- The NARRATOR changes (omniscient to first-person, vice versa)
- The TONE shifts significantly (warm to cosmic, playful to serious)
- The REGISTER changes (intimate to universal, specific to cosmic)
- The EMOTIONAL QUALITY transforms
- The PURPOSE of the text shifts

### STEP 3: MATCH VOICE TO CONTENT
For each speaker section, ask:
- **Gender**: Is this speaker male or female? (CRITICAL)
- **Archetype**: What kind of being/character are they? (disciple, buddha, teacher, etc.)
- **Tone**: What emotional tone should they have?
- **Purpose**: What is this speech meant to accomplish?
- **Register**: What spiritual/emotional level is this?
- **Energy**: High/low? Active/passive? Calm/energetic?

### STEP 4: SELECT VOICE
Choose the voice that:
- Matches the gender
- Reflects the archetype
- Carries the right tone
- Serves the purpose
- Embodies the register
- Feels "right" for what's being said

### STEP 5: MARK TRANSITIONS
Place speaker tags at EVERY transition where the voice changes.

## Special Considerations for the Lotus Sutra

### The Opening Formula
"Thus have I heard. At one time, the Buddha was staying..."
- Use [Charon] - This is cosmic truth speaking, ancient transmission
- The voice of all time, all wisdom, speaking to us

### Narrative Exposition
"The Buddha entered profound meditation..." "Light radiated from his body..."
- Generally [Charon] - Epic scope and cosmic significance
- OR [Rasalgethi] if it's warm storytelling meant to draw reader in
- NOT narration of technical details - voice the spirituality

### Buddha Speaking
The Buddha never speaks just one way. Detect:
- **Contemplative teaching** → [Iapetus] (patient, wise, gentle)
- **Authoritative proclamation** → [Sadaltager] (powerful, commanding)
- **Cosmic revelation** → [Charon] (eternal truth revealed)
- **Gentle guidance** → [Iapetus] or [Kore] depending on context
- **Teaching through parable** → [Rasalgethi] (warm storyteller)
- **Direct address to heart** → [Zephyr] (intimate, personal)

### Male Disciples Speaking
- **Śāriputra** → [Gacrux] (heroic noble voice - he's chief disciple)
- **Mañjuśrī** → [Gacrux] or [Puck] depending on whether he's being noble or clever
- **Maitreya** → [Gacrux] (noble future Buddha)
- **Other disciples** → [Gacrux] as default for noble questioners
- **If clever/paradoxical** → [Puck]
- **If analytical** → [Orus]

### Female Characters Speaking
- **Mahāprajāpatī** → [Leda] (maternal authority, she raised Buddha)
- **Yaśodharā** → [Leda] (wisdom, strength, maternal love)
- **Dragon princess** → [Schedar] (becoming Buddha is powerful transformation)
- **Nuns receiving prophecy** → [Aoede] (joyful, hopeful) or [Schedar] (powerful)

### Bodhisattvas
- **Avalokiteśvara** → [Sulafat] (ethereal, cosmic compassion, transcendent)
- **Other bodhisattvas** → Depends on their nature:
  - Wise/peaceful → [Iapetus]
  - Powerful → [Schedar] or [Sadaltager]
  - Mysterious → [Zubenelgenubi]
  - Compassionate → [Leda]

### Parables
- **Parable introduction/setup** → [Rasalgethi] (warm storyteller)
- **Within parable dialogue** → Character voices as appropriate
- **Parable explanation** → [Charon] or [Iapetus] depending on tone
- **The teaching within parable** → Often [Iapetus] (wisdom)

### Verses and Poetry
Verses are tricky. Ask:
- **Who is "speaking" this verse?** (character, narrator, truth itself?)
- **What is the verse doing?** (teaching, describing, praising, etc.)
- **What is the emotional register?** (cosmic, intimate, joyful, etc.)
- Generally: Keep the same voice as the preceding prose section
- OR shift to [Charon] for cosmic scope
- OR shift to more poetic/ethereal voices for the beauty of verse

### Lists and Assemblies
"There were twelve thousand monks... Mañjuśrī... Avalokiteśvara..."
- Use [Charon] for the cosmic assembly
- Voice the significance and vastness, not just list items
- This is the universe gathering, not a roster

### Transitions Between Speakers
If Mañjuśrī is speaking, then the text says "At that time, Maitreya said..."
- Change voice from [Gacrux] (Mañjuśrī) to [Gacrux] (Maitreya) OR [Charon] if narrating
- The transition itself might be [Charon] ("At that time") then [Gacrux] ("Maitreya said")
- OR combine as: narrative plus speech in character voice

### The Burning House
"This burning house is on fire. You gotta get everybody out of here."
- [Rasalgethi] - This is warm, urgent storytelling
- Accessible, pressing, immediate, not cosmic
- The heart speaking to the heart

### The Phantom City
- [Rasalgethi] for the parable telling
- Warmth and accessibility for this central teaching
- But perhaps [Charon] for the explanation of why (cosmic metaphor)

### Buddha's Eternity (Chapter 16)
"The Buddha achieved enlightenment in the distant past and will never actually enter nirvāṇa"
- [Charon] - This is cosmic truth about time itself
- The voice of eternity speaking
- Absolutely not gentle/intimate - this is VAST

### Women Breaking Through
Dragon princess becoming Buddha, Mahāprajāpatī's authority
- Use [Schedar] for the power and transformation
- Make sure female authority is POWERFUL not diminished
- These moments should feel paradigm-shifting in the voice

## Critical Rules

### RULE 1: GENDER ALIGNMENT IS NON-NEGOTIABLE
- Male characters MUST use male voices
- Female characters MUST use female voices
- This is not optional; it's professional standard
- If you're unsure, keep the character consistent with their known gender

### RULE 2: DETECT IMPLICIT SPEAKER CHANGES
Not all speaker changes are explicitly marked. Look for:
- Shift in perspective (objective to subjective)
- Change in emotional tone (calm to urgent)
- Change in register (intimate to cosmic)
- Change in the "voice of the text" itself
- Even if the grammatical subject is the same, the VOICE may change

### RULE 3: HONOR SUBTEXT
Sometimes the "speaker" isn't who you think:
- Narrative describing Buddha's thoughts → might be Buddha's inner voice [Iapetus]
- Description of suffering → might be the voice of compassion [Leda] or [Sulafat]
- Cosmic principle stated → might be Charon speaking universal truth
- Listen to what the text is REALLY saying, not just who's grammatically speaking

### RULE 4: CONTINUITY WITHOUT MONOTONY
- Don't change voices unnecessarily
- But don't bore the listener with the same voice for 20 pages
- Vary voices strategically to maintain engagement
- Each voice change should feel natural and purposeful

### RULE 5: EMOTIONAL AUTHENTICITY
- The voice must match the emotional truth of the passage
- Don't make a joyful passage sound solemn just to follow grammar
- Don't make a profound passage sound casual just to maintain speaker consistency
- Emotional truth > technical consistency

### RULE 6: SPIRITUAL AUTHENTICITY
This is sacred text. The voices must:
- Honor the spiritual content
- Convey reverence and awe where appropriate
- Maintain the teaching's power
- Not diminish the profound with wrong voice choices

## Output Format

When you complete your analysis, you will provide:

1. **VOICE ASSIGNMENT MAP** - Every location where a voice tag should appear
2. **DETAILED JUSTIFICATION** - For each tag, explain why that voice
3. **SPEAKER TRANSITIONS** - Show exactly where voices change
4. **SPECIAL NOTES** - Flag any challenging passages
5. **COMPLETE MARKED MANUSCRIPT** - Full text with all voice tags inserted

## What Makes This Different

You are NOT:
- Making surface-level speaker identifications
- Following a rigid formula
- Missing subtle voice shifts
- Creating unnecessary tag changes
- Making gender mistakes
- Forcing voices to match grammar instead of meaning
- Creating monotonous narration

You ARE:
- Reading deeply for every layer of meaning
- Detecting implicit as well as explicit speaker changes
- Matching emotional truth to voice
- Respecting gender and archetype
- Creating a professional-grade narrated manuscript
- Making every voice change serve the text
- Honoring the spiritual content
- Creating beautiful, engaging audio narration

## Your Output Will Be

A complete manuscript with:
- ✅ Speaker tags at EVERY appropriate transition
- ✅ Detailed justification for every tag
- ✅ 100% gender alignment
- ✅ Emotional authenticity
- ✅ Spiritual reverence
- ✅ Professional audio-production quality
- ✅ Natural flow and engagement
