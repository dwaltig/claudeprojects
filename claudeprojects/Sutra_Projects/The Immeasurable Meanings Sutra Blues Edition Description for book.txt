The Immeasurable Meanings Sutra
Blues Edition
Description for book:
The Immeasurable Meanings Sutra is the opening act of the Threefold Lotus Sutra—the prologue before the Buddha reveals his ultimate teaching. In this short but powerful text, the Buddha emerges from deep samadhi to proclaim that one Dharma contains immeasurable meanings, and immeasurable meanings come from one Dharma.

This Blues interpretation strips away the ornate Chinese classical language and delivers the sutra's core message in the direct, soulful idiom of the American Blues tradition.

The teaching here is simple and profound: the Dharma is like water. It takes the shape of whatever vessel holds it. The same truth that enlightens a Buddha also heals a broken heart in Memphis. The same medicine that cures cosmic suffering works on your Tuesday morning.

One Dharma. Immeasurable meanings. That's the Blues and the Buddha, singing the same song.

A brief, concentrated teaching—perfect for meditation or as a prelude to the Lotus Sutra itself.
