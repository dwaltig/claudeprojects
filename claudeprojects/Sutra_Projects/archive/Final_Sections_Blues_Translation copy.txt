## Part 8: The Great Teaching on Compassion and the Six Gates

Now when them Buddhas seen that practitioner done got their eyes cleaned out, their heart ready, they started teaching deep. They opened up and spoke about the Great Compassion, about Love that don't play favorites, about Joy that lifts everybody up, and about Equanimity—that peace that holds steady no matter what storm come through.

And they taught what they call "loving speech"—that's talking to folks like they matter, like they somebody. They taught the Six Ways of Harmony, how to live together without tearing each other apart:
- Sharing the same space without throwing elbows
- Following the same road without tripping each other up
- Thinking the same good thoughts without jealousy
- Speaking words that build instead of burn
- Getting the same liberation together, not climbing over each other's backs
- And dividing up what you got fair and square, so nobody go hungry while somebody else get fat

That practitioner, when they heard this teaching, their heart just swelled up like a river after rain. Joy came flooding through. And they didn't just nod and forget—they kept on reciting, kept on practicing, never let up, never put it down.

Then from that empty sky, a voice come down, sweet and true, saying:

"Listen here, child. Time for you to confess. Time to lay it all out—body and mind, everything you done wrong."

## Part 9: The Six Roots Confession - How the Trouble Got In

### The Body's Three Gates

"See, your body done three kinds of wrong:
- **Killing** - taking life that ain't yours to take
- **Stealing** - grabbing what don't belong in your hands
- **Sexual misconduct** - using people like they things, breaking hearts and homes

### The Mind's Seven Troubles

And your mind, Lord, your mind been thinking all kinds of no-good:
- **Greed** - wanting, wanting, wanting, never satisfied
- **Hatred** - that poison that eats you from inside
- **Delusion** - can't see straight, stumbling in the dark
- **Lying** - tongue twisted, truth nowhere in sight
- **Harsh speech** - words that cut like knives
- **Gossip** - stirring up trouble, spreading poison
- **Wrong views** - got the map upside down, heading the wrong way

These ten evils, child, and them Five Unforgivable Sins—they got you jumping around like a monkey that can't sit still. You stuck like your hand in molasses, can't pull free. That greed got you grabbing at everything, clinging to whatever you can touch.

And them Six Sense Roots—eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mind—they like six doors standing wide open, letting trouble walk right in. All that bad karma got roots and branches spreading everywhere, leaves and flowers of suffering growing throughout the Three Worlds, the Twenty-Five Realms of Existence, every place a soul can be born.

That karma water the seeds of ignorance. It feeds old age and death. It makes them Twelve Links of Suffering grow up strong—suffering piled on suffering, the Eightfold Wrong Path, the Eight Kinds of Difficulty, you been through every one.

**So listen:** You got to confess these evil deeds. You got to repent these unwholesome ways. You got to turn around and walk the other direction."

## Part 10: The Dream Teaching - When Samantabhadra Come at Night

Now that practitioner, when they heard that voice, they took it to heart. They kept the Great Vehicle teaching close, day and night. Didn't let it go. Mahayana was their food, their water, their breath.

And one night, while they was sleeping, Samantabhadra Bodhisattva came to them in a dream. Taught them the Dharma clear as day—couldn't tell dreaming from waking, it was that real.

Samantabhadra comforted them, saying:

"You been reciting, child, but you forgot this line here. You let this verse slip. Let me remind you..."

And the practitioner heard that teaching like hearing water when you dying of thirst. They understood it deep—not just the words, but the meaning behind the meaning, the truth underneath the truth. And they remembered. Didn't forget again.

Day after day it went like that. Their mind got sharper, clearer, stronger. The fog burned off.

Then Samantabhadra taught them to remember the Buddhas of the Ten Directions—to hold them in mind, to call them by name, to know they there.

Following that teaching, the practitioner made their heart straight, made their mind right. And gradually, little by little, with their mind's eye, they started seeing:

**The Buddhas of the Eastern Direction.**

Bodies gold like sunrise. Beautiful beyond measure. Perfect and radiant.

Saw one Buddha. Then saw another. Then another. Like stars coming out at twilight—one, then two, then the whole sky full of light.

And gradually, steadily, they saw all the Buddhas of the Eastern Direction. Every single one. The whole eastern sky filled with enlightened ones, shining like morning.

## Part 11: The Confession for the High and Mighty - Kings, Officials, and the Powerful

Now listen, you kings and queens, you government officials, you Brahmins sitting pretty, you landlords and businesspeople, you politicians and power-holders—**this word for you:**

Y'all got a special kind of sickness. It's called **greed with authority**. You can't never get enough. More land, more money, more control—you want it all and you don't care who you step on to get it.

Some of you done committed the Five Unforgivable Sins:
- Killed your own mama or daddy
- Killed a holy one
- Made the Buddha's body bleed (metaphorically speaking—you hurt the sacred)
- Split the community apart
- Done evil to your own teacher

Some of you done slandered the Great Vehicle teachings, talked bad about the Mahayana sutras. You got the Ten Evils down pat, mastered every unwholesome deed.

**And the results of all that?** Child, you heading for a fall harder than a thunderstorm. You going down to Avici Hell—that's the lowest, hottest, worst place there is. No breaks, no relief, just suffering without pause.

### But Here's the Hope:

If you want to wipe away that karmic debt, if you want to clear that obstacle, **you got to do five things:**

### First Confession: Get Your Mind Right About the Sacred

- Generate shame. Feel the weight of what you done.
- Cultivate humility. Get low before the truth.
- Repent your sins. Name them out loud.
- Don't slander the Three Jewels (Buddha, Dharma, Sangha)
- Don't block people from becoming monks and nuns
- Don't make trouble for people trying to live pure lives
- Practice the Six Remembrances:
  - Remember the Buddha
  - Remember the Dharma
  - Remember the Sangha
  - Remember moral conduct
  - Remember generosity
  - Remember the divine realms
- Support and supply those who uphold the Great Vehicle
  - (You don't got to bow down to them, but you got to support them)
- Contemplate the deep sutras, the First Principle, the Emptiness that frees
- **Think on this truth**—that IS the First Confession for rulers and laypeople.

### Second Confession: Honor Your Roots

- Take care of your mama and daddy (filial piety)
- Respect your teachers and elders
- **This is the Second Confession.**

### Third Confession: Rule with Justice

- Govern according to what's right (the True Dharma)
- Don't oppress your people
- Don't twist justice to hurt the innocent
- **This is the Third Confession.**

### Fourth Confession: Let Living Things Live

- On the Six Fast Days each month, issue orders throughout your territory:
  - As far as your power reach, let no killing happen
  - Give the animals a break from slaughter
  - Let the condemned rest from execution
- Practice this way.
- **This is the Fourth Confession.**

### Fifth Confession: Trust the Way Things Work

- Believe deeply in cause and effect (karma ain't playing)
- Trust in the One True Path
- Know that the Buddha ain't dead—He still here, still teaching
- **This is the Fifth Confession.**

## Part 12: The Buddha's Final Promise

Then the Buddha turned to Ananda and said:

"Ananda, listen good. In the future ages, if anybody practice this confession method I just taught—these Five Confessions—you need to understand something:

**That person has put on the robe of shame and conscience.** They wearing humility like armor. **All the Buddhas protecting them,** helping them, holding them up.

**And it won't be long**—you hear me?—**it won't be long before they achieve Anuttara-Samyak-Sambodhi.** That's the Supreme, Perfect, Complete Enlightenment. They going all the way home."

---

## Part 13: The Great Response - Heaven and Earth Rejoice

When the Buddha spoke these words, **ten thousand divine beings**—princes of heaven, gods and goddesses—they got the Dharma Eye Pure. They saw clear. They understood. The Truth opened up inside them like a flower.

And Maitreya Bodhisattva, all them great bodhisattvas gathered there, and Ananda—every one of them heard what the Buddha said.

**And they rejoiced.**

Their hearts got full. They bowed. They committed themselves to practice it, to hold it, to pass it on.

**They received it with joy and put it into practice.**

## Translator's Notes

### Key Metaphors and Interpretive Choices:

1. **Six Gates/Doors**: Transformed the Six Sense Roots (eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mind) into "six doors standing wide open"—a blues image of vulnerability and how trouble gets in.

2. **Monkey Mind**: Kept this traditional Buddhist image but grounded it in blues vernacular—"jumping around like a monkey that can't sit still."

3. **Molasses/Sticky**: Translated the traditional "glue" metaphor into "hand stuck in molasses"—a Southern/blues image for being trapped.

4. **The Dream Teaching**: Emphasized the mystical realism of blues spirituality where dreams and waking are equally real channels for divine teaching.

5. **Royal Confession**: Structured the Five Confessions as practical, grounded acts—not abstract principles but concrete behaviors (supporting monastics, honoring parents, just governance, preserving life, trusting karma).

6. **The Closing Verses**: Created seven blues songs that could actually be performed, using traditional blues structure (AAB pattern), repetition, call-and-response potential, and singable rhythm. Each verse captures a major theme:
   - Six Gates (the problem)
   - Confession (the turning)
   - Purification (the vision)
   - Compassion (the heart)
   - Royal Repentance (the social teaching)
   - The Promise (the hope)
   - Final Hallelujah (the celebration)

7. **"Won't be long"**: This is a classic blues/gospel phrase that perfectly captures the Buddha's promise of swift enlightenment for those who practice confession—it carries both eschatological hope and immediate encouragement.

8. **Sadhu/Amen**: Ended with both the traditional Buddhist affirmation (Sadhu) and Christian gospel equivalent (Amen) to show this is a universal spiritual truth transcending religious boundaries.

### Emotional Architecture:

This translation moves through the classic blues progression:
- **Trouble identified** (the Six Roots corruption)
- **Confession and lament** (naming the sins)
- **Divine intervention** (Samantabhadra's teaching)
- **Transformation** (seeing the Buddhas)
- **Practical wisdom** (the Five Confessions)
- **Promise and hope** (swift enlightenment)
- **Celebration and testimony** (the closing verses)

The language is designed to be **spoken aloud, chanted, or sung**. Every section has rhythm. The confessional parts use the emotional intensity of gospel testimony. The teaching parts use the practical wisdom of blues advice-giving. The visionary parts use the mystical language of spiritual experience.

This is dharma you can **feel in your bones**, wisdom that **speaks to the heart**, and a path that's **walked with real feet on real ground**.
