    THE BUDDHA SPEAKS OF THE SUTRA ON CONTEMPLATING
              UNIVERSAL WORTHY BODHISATTVA

                    (Blues-Vernacular Translation)

                          PART TWO: THE VISION
             Where Universal Worthy Comes Riding Down

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════


WHO CAN SEE UNIVERSAL WORTHY AND HOW LONG IT TAKES

Listen here, Ānanda, the Buddha said. Universal Worthy Bodhisattva, he come from the East—from that Pure and Wondrous Land they talk about in the Lotus Sutra. Now, I done already told you all about that country in that other teaching, so I'm just gonna give you the short version today.

Ānanda, you listening? Whether you're a monk or a nun, whether you're a man or woman walking the path at home, whether you're a dragon-king or one of them heavenly beings or any kind of creature in this whole wide world—don't matter who you are—if you reciting them Great Vehicle scriptures, if you practicing that Mahayana way, if you done raised up your mind to walk that great path, if you wanting to see Universal Worthy Bodhisattva's beautiful form, if you wanting to see that Many Treasures Buddha's tower, if you wanting to see Śākyamuni Buddha and all his manifestation-bodies scattered through the cosmos, if you wanting to get your six senses purified and clean—then you better learn this here contemplation I'm about to teach.

This contemplation got power, you hear? It wipes out all kinds of obstacles. It lets you see what's fine and wonderful. You don't even got to enter no deep meditation-trance for this. Just hold onto these words, just recite them, just keep your mind focused on this practice. Keep your thoughts following one after another, never leaving that Great Vehicle teaching. You do this one day, maybe twenty-one days straight, and you gonna see Universal Worthy.

Now some folks got heavier burdens than others, that's just how it is. Some got obstacles thick as Georgia mud. For them, it might take forty-nine days before they see him. Some got it even harder—they might not see him till this lifetime's over, might be the next life when the vision comes. Some might take two lifetimes, some might take three. See, everybody's karma different, everybody's past deeds weigh different, so the time it takes ain't the same for everyone. That's why the teaching comes out different for different folks.


THE SIZE OF UNIVERSAL WORTHY—BIGGER THAN YOUR MIND CAN HOLD

Now let me tell you about Universal Worthy Bodhisattva himself. His body—you can't measure it. Goes on forever. His voice—you can't measure it. Goes on forever. His form and appearance—you can't measure it. Goes on forever. Infinite, you hear? Boundless. Beyond counting.

But when he wants to come down to this world here, when he wants to visit this beat-up old Jambudvīpa continent where we live, he got to use his sovereign spiritual powers, got to shrink himself down small, make himself fit into a world he's too big for. Why? 'Cause we people in this suffering world, we carrying three kinds of heavy obstacles, weighing us down like chains. So he uses his wisdom-power to transform himself, and he comes riding on a white elephant—white as new snow, white as light itself.


THE SIX-TUSKED WHITE ELEPHANT—A CHARIOT OF LIGHT

Now this elephant, let me paint you the picture. This elephant got six tusks—six ivory tusks gleaming like moonlight. And he standing on seven supports touching the ground. Under each one of them seven supports, a lotus flower blooms up—seven lotus flowers big as wagon wheels, holding him up.

This elephant's color? White. But not just any white—we talking about a white that makes crystal look dirty, a white that puts snow-covered mountains to shame. Can't nothing compare. The best glass, the finest jade, the whitest snow on the highest peak—all that ain't nothing next to this elephant's radiance.

How big is he? Four hundred and fifty yojanas long—that's thousands and thousands of miles, son, longer than any road you ever walked. And four hundred yojanas tall—so high you'd break your neck trying to see the top.

And listen—on the tips of them six tusks, there's six bathing pools, you understand? Six pools of pure water. In every single pool, fourteen lotus flowers growing, big as the pools themselves. When them flowers open up, they like the king of all the trees in heaven—magnificent, spreading wide and glorious.

And on top of each one of them flowers, there's a heavenly maiden, beautiful beyond beautiful, putting them regular heaven-girls to shame. Her face glowing red like the sunset, her beauty making your heart stop. And in her hands—she ain't holding nothing earthly—no, in her hands just naturally appears five harps, five golden harps, and around each harp, five hundred different musical instruments keeping it company, making harmony.

And there's five hundred birds—ducks and geese and mandarin ducks, all of them colored like living jewels, precious-stone colors, emerald and ruby and sapphire, perched in the flower-leaves, singing songs no human throat could make.


THE LOTUS ON THE ELEPHANT'S TRUNK—THE FLOWER THAT WAITS FOR YOU

Now the elephant's trunk, he holding a lotus flower. The stem of this lotus, it's the color of a red pearl, deep crimson like blood that's been blessed. The flower itself is gold—pure gold—but it ain't opened yet, you see? It's waiting. Waiting for what? Waiting for you to do your practice, waiting for you to confess your wrongs.

So when the practitioner sees all this, what they got to do? They got to confess again, got to come clean again, got to look deep in their heart and think hard on that Great Vehicle teaching, and they can't let their mind rest, can't let up. And when they do that—when they really do that—the flower opens. That golden flower spreads its petals, and golden light comes pouring out.

The lotus platform, it's made of that deep-red maṇi-jewel they call "true red gem." The flower's garlands made of wonderful Brahma-maṇi jewels. The flower's stamens made of vajra-diamond jewels. And sitting right there on the lotus platform, there's a transformation-Buddha—a manifested Buddha sitting in meditation. And all around him, sitting on the stamens, crowds of Bodhisattvas, all manifested, all real.


THE GOLDEN LIGHT THAT TRAVELS THROUGH THE ELEPHANT

And from that transformation-Buddha's brow—right between his eyes—comes a ray of golden light. This light shoots out and goes right into the elephant's trunk. Travels through the elephant's trunk and comes out, enters the elephant's eyes. Comes out the eyes, enters the elephant's ears. Comes out the ears and shines up onto the top of the elephant's head, and there it transforms into a golden platform sitting on the elephant's crown.

On top of the elephant's head, now there's three transformation-people appeared. One of them holding a golden wheel—the wheel of the Dharma, the wheel of the teaching. One holding a maṇi-pearl—that wish-fulfilling jewel that grants what the heart needs. One holding a vajra-staff, a diamond-hard staff, and he lifts it up like he's gonna touch the elephant with it.

Soon as he touches that elephant, the elephant can walk. But listen—his feet don't touch the ground. He ain't walking on earth like you and me. He's stepping on emptiness, walking on air, seven feet above the ground. And everywhere his feet would've touched, there's footprints anyway—footprints floating in the air. And in every footprint, you can see the Dharma-wheel, the thousand-spoked wheel with its hub and rim, complete and perfect.

And between each spoke of each wheel, a great lotus flower springs up. And on each lotus, another transformation-elephant appears, also with seven supports. And these elephants, they follow the great elephant, walking when he walks, stepping when he steps. Every time the great elephant lifts his foot or puts it down, seven thousand elephants come into being, following behind like an entourage, like a royal procession, like a congregation marching home.


THE GOLDEN SADDLE AND THE JEWELED PAVILION

That trunk, it's the color of a red lotus now. On it, a transformation-Buddha radiating light from between his eyebrows. The light is golden, pure gold. Just like before, it enters the elephant's trunk, comes out and enters the elephant's eyes, comes out and enters the elephant's ears. But this time, when it comes out the ears, it goes to the elephant's neck, rises up gradually, climbs up the elephant's back, and there it transforms into a golden saddle.

This saddle decorated with seven kinds of treasures, all kinds of precious ornaments making it splendid. On the four sides of the saddle, there's seven-jeweled pillars, all decorated and adorned, holding up a jeweled pavilion, a palace of light.

In the center of that pavilion, there's a seven-jeweled lotus flower. The stamens of this flower made from a hundred treasures working together. The platform of the lotus made from the great maṇi-jewel, the supreme gem.

And on that lotus, sitting cross-legged in meditation—here he is now, here he comes—there's a Bodhisattva. His name is Universal Worthy. Pǔxián. Samantabhadra. The one whose practice extends everywhere.


UNIVERSAL WORTHY HIMSELF—THE VISION ARRIVES AT LAST

His body the color of white jade, glowing like the moon. Fifty different kinds of light streaming from him. Fifty different colors making up the halo around his neck. From every pore of his body, golden light flowing out like water, like rivers of dawn. And at the tip of each golden ray, there's countless transformation-Buddhas, and around every Buddha, crowds of transformation-Bodhisattvas, all keeping them company, all making an assembly.

And he comes walking—walking slow and peaceful, calm and easy—raining down great jeweled flowers as he moves. He walks right up to where the practitioner is sitting. Right up to where you are.

The elephant opens his mouth. And up on them tusks, in them bathing-pools, them heavenly maidens start playing their instruments, start singing. The sound is so subtle, so fine, so beautiful it makes you want to weep. And what they singing about? They praising the Great Vehicle, they testifying about the One True Path, the single way that all teachings point to.


WHAT THE PRACTITIONER DOES WHEN THE VISION COMES

When the practitioner sees this—when you see this—joy fills up your heart like flood-water rising. You bow down. You pay respect. You want to read them deep scriptures even more now, you want to recite them sacred texts. You bow to the Buddhas in all ten directions, all the countless Awakened Ones throughout infinite space. You bow to that Many Treasures tower, you bow to Śākyamuni Buddha. You bow to Universal Worthy and all them great Bodhisattvas.

And then you make a vow. You say it clear: "If I got the blessings from my past lives, if I'm supposed to see Universal Worthy, then let him who's named Everywhere-Auspicious show me his physical form. Let me see him with these eyes."

After you make that vow, you practice six times every day and every night—morning, noon, evening, midnight, before dawn, at sunrise. Six times a day you bow to the Buddhas in all ten directions. You practice the ritual of confession, coming clean about all your wrongs. You recite them Great Vehicle scriptures. You read them Mahayana texts. You think deep about what the Great Vehicle means. You keep your mind on Great Vehicle practices. You honor and support folks who uphold the Great Vehicle teaching.

And here's the hardest part—you got to look at every single person like they Buddha himself. Every person you see, you look at them and see the Buddha. Every living being, you look at them like they your own mama and daddy, like they the ones who gave you life.


UNIVERSAL WORTHY'S WHITE LIGHT—THE SIGN HE'S COMING

When you thinking like that, when your mind is right like that, then Universal Worthy Bodhisattva—from between his eyebrows—sends out the great white light, the light of the supreme person. This white-tuft light, this hair-curl light, this úrṇā-light that all Buddhas have.

When this light appears, Universal Worthy Bodhisattva's body looks so fine, so dignified, like a purple-gold mountain standing against the sky. Perfect and subtle, excellent beyond words. He's got all thirty-two marks of a great being, every one of them complete.

From every pore of his body, great light shining out, making the great elephant turn golden. All them transformation-elephants turn gold too. All them transformation-Bodhisattvas turn gold too. And the golden light keeps spreading—it lights up the Eastern direction, countless worlds in the East all turning golden. South, West, North—the four intermediate directions—up and down—the whole cosmos bathed in this golden light, everything the same color, the color of dawn, the color of awakening, the color of freedom.


THE TEN DIRECTIONS FILL WITH UNIVERSAL WORTHIES

And then—oh, Lord—then in each direction, every single direction, there's one Bodhisattva appears, riding on a six-tusked white elephant-king. Each one looks just like Universal Worthy, can't tell them apart, all equal, all identical. The ten directions fill up with countless, infinite transformation-elephants filling all space. All this happening by Universal Worthy Bodhisattva's spiritual power, so that the person reciting the scripture can see it all, can witness the whole thing with their own eyes.

When the practitioner sees all these Bodhisattvas, their body and mind fills with joy—joy like they never known, joy beyond measure. They bow down and make respects and say, "You who have great compassion and great kindness, you who feel for the suffering of beings, please have mercy on me and teach me the Dharma!"

And when they say this, all them Bodhisattvas—all of them together, different mouths but the same voice—they all preach the pure Great Vehicle teachings. They speak verses and praises honoring the practitioner, encouraging them, lifting them up.

This right here—this is what we call the beginning contemplation of Universal Worthy Bodhisattva. This is the first stage of the vision, the initial境界, the starting-place of seeing what's real.


IN DREAMS, UNIVERSAL WORTHY TEACHES YOU WHAT YOU FORGOT

After the practitioner sees all this, they keep their mind on the Great Vehicle day and night, never letting go. And then, even in their sleep, even in dreams, they see Universal Worthy teaching them the Dharma, just as clear as when they awake—ain't no difference between the dream and waking.

Universal Worthy comforts them, settles their heart, and says, "What you been reciting—you forgot this sentence right here. You forgot this verse. Let me remind you."

And when the practitioner hears what Universal Worthy says, they understand the deep meaning, they remember it and don't forget. Day after day like this, their mind gets sharper, their memory gets clearer. Universal Worthy Bodhisattva teaches them to remember the Buddhas in all ten directions.

Following Universal Worthy's teaching, they make their mind right, make their thoughts correct. And gradually, with their mind's eye, they see the Buddhas in the Eastern direction—bodies the color of gold, dignified and excellent and subtle.

They see one Buddha. Then they see another Buddha. Like this, gradually, step by step, they see all the Buddhas throughout the East, every last one of them. Because their mind is getting sharp and quick, they come to see all the Buddhas in all ten directions, the whole assembly of Awakened Ones.


THE BUDDHAS APPEAR—BUT NOT CLEARLY YET

When they see all these Buddhas, their heart fills with happiness, and they say, "It's because of the Great Vehicle that I got to see this great being Universal Worthy. It's because of this great being's power that I got to see all these Buddhas."

But even though they seeing the Buddhas, they ain't seeing them real clear yet, you understand? When they close their eyes, they see the Buddhas. When they open their eyes, the vision goes away, disappears like morning mist.

So they say this, and they prostrate their whole body—forehead, two hands, two knees, all five points touching the ground—and they bow to the Buddhas throughout the ten directions. After they bow to all them Buddhas, they kneel down proper, put their palms together, and they speak like this:

"You Buddhas, you World-Honored Ones, you got the Ten Powers, the Four Fearlessnesses, the Eighteen Uncommon Qualities, the great compassion, the great kindness, the Three Ways of Mindfulness. You stay forever in the world. Among all forms, you the finest form, the supreme form. What sin I got that I can't see you clearly? What's wrong with me?"


THE CONFESSION THAT BRINGS CLARITY

After they say this, they confess again—they confess till they clean, till all that dirt of the past is washed away. And when their confession is pure, Universal Worthy Bodhisattva appears before them again, standing there, walking there, sitting there, lying down there—never leaving their side, not even in dreams. Even in sleep, he's always teaching them the Dharma.

When the person wakes up, they filled with Dharma-joy, happiness from the teaching. Like this, day and night for three weeks—twenty-one days straight—and then they receive the dhāraṇī, the spell of turning and holding, the memory that never loses nothing.

Because they got this dhāraṇī power, all the wonderful teachings that Buddhas and Bodhisattvas preach—they can remember it, hold onto it, never let it slip away. They also start dreaming about the Seven Buddhas of the past, especially Śākyamuni Buddha, who comes and teaches them in dreams. All these World-Honored Ones, each one of them praises the Great Vehicle scriptures, lifts them up, honors them.


CONFESSION BEFORE ALL BUDDHAS—TELLING THE DARK SECRETS

Then the practitioner confesses again, bows again to the Buddhas throughout the ten directions. After bowing to them ten-direction Buddhas, Universal Worthy Bodhisattva stands right there in front of them and teaches them to speak about all their past-life karma, all the causes and conditions from previous existences.

He tells them: "Confess your dark and evil deeds. Speak out loud about all your sins in the presence of all the World-Honored Ones. Open your mouth and reveal what you done."

And when they confess like that, when they really lay it all out, right then and there they receive the samādhi called "Buddhas Appearing Before You"—the meditation where you actually see the Buddhas standing there in front of your face.

When they get this samādhi, they see the Eastern direction—they see Akṣobhya Buddha and his Joyful World, clear and distinct and detailed, like looking at something right in front of you. And it's like this in all ten directions—they see the Buddhas and their supreme pure lands, every direction, all of them, clear and distinct.


THE VAJRA-MAN WHO PURIFIES THE SIX SENSES

After they see all ten direction Buddhas like this, they dream there's a vajra-person—a diamond-hard man—on top of the elephant's head. He's holding a vajra-staff, and he touches all six of the practitioner's sense-organs with that staff—touches their eyes, ears, nose, tongue, body, mind. Touches all six roots with the diamond-hard truth.

After he touches the six roots, Universal Worthy Bodhisattva teaches the practitioner the method for confessing the six sense-organs, the way to purify the six roots and make them clean.

You confess like this for one day, or all the way up to seven days. And because of the power of that "Buddhas Appearing Before You" samādhi, because Universal Worthy Bodhisattva's teaching adorns your practice, your ears gradually start hearing sounds beyond the normal range—you hear through obstacles, hear past walls and mountains. Your eyes gradually start seeing things beyond the normal range—you see through obstacles, see past darkness and distance. Your nose gradually smells fragrances beyond the normal range—you smell what's far away, what's hidden.

It's all explained in detail in the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra, you can read it there.


THE JOY OF PURIFICATION—SIX ROOTS CLEAN AT LAST

When you get them six roots purified like this, your body and mind fill up with joy. Ain't no evil marks on you no more. Your mind becomes pure Dharma, nothing but teaching, nothing but truth. Your mind matches up with the teaching, corresponds with the law of things.

And then you receive hundreds, thousands, millions, billions of dhāraṇīs—turning-and-holding spells, memory-doors that never close. You see hundreds, thousands, millions, billions, countless Buddhas—infinite Awakened Ones all throughout space.

And all these World-Honored Ones, every last one of them, they stretch out their right hand and they touch your head. They rub the crown of your head with their compassion and they say:

"Well done! Well done! You who walk the Great Vehicle path! You who raise up the great adorning aspiration! You who keep your mind on the Great Vehicle! We, too, when we first raised the awakening-mind way back when—we was just like you, earnest and not letting up. Because we walked that Great Vehicle path in our former lives, now we've accomplished the pure body of complete and universal knowledge. You, too—you got to keep practicing diligent, can't slack off now.

"This Great Vehicle scripture here—this is the treasure-house of all Buddhas. This is the eye of all the Buddhas in past, present, and future—the ten directions and the three times, this is what they see with. This is what gives birth to all the Tathāgatas in the three periods of time. This produces the Buddha-seed.

"The person who upholds this scripture—they upholding the Buddha's body, they performing the Buddha's work. You should know—this kind of person, they sent by all the Buddhas, they covered by the Buddhas' robes, they the true Dharma-children of all the Tathāgatas.

"You walking the Great Vehicle—you not letting the teaching-seed get cut off, you keeping the line going.

"Now look—look to the East. Observe the Buddhas there."


THE PURE LANDS APPEAR—LANDS FLAT AS THE PALM OF YOUR HAND

When the Buddhas say this, the practitioner looks and sees—in the Eastern direction, all them countless worlds—the ground is level and flat like the palm of your hand. Ain't no piles of dirt, no hills or valleys, no thorn-bushes or rough places. The ground made of lapis lazuli, that deep blue precious stone, with borders of gold running through it. The worlds in all ten directions just the same—pure, level, beautiful.

When they see this ground, they see treasure-trees. These treasure-trees tall and excellent, five thousand yojanas high—that's tens of thousands of miles, trees tall as the sky. These trees constantly producing gold and silver and seven kinds of precious adornments.

Under the trees, naturally appearing, there's treasure lion-thrones, thrones fit for a king or a Buddha. Each lion-throne twenty yojanas high, and from the thrones, a hundred kinds of jewel-light shining out.

All these trees and all these treasure-thrones—on each throne, naturally appearing, five hundred white elephants. And on each elephant, Universal Worthy Bodhisattva sitting.


A PRAYER BEFORE THE THRONES

When the practitioner sees this, they bow to all these Universal Worthies and they say, "What sin I got that I only see the jeweled ground and the jeweled thrones and the jeweled trees, but I don't see the Buddhas?"

Soon as they speak these words, on every single throne, a World-Honored One appears, dignified and excellent and subtle, sitting on the treasure-throne.

When they see all these Buddhas, their mind fills with great happiness. They recite and study the Great Vehicle scriptures even harder.

Because of the Great Vehicle's power, a voice comes from empty space, praising them, saying: "Well done! Well done! Good son! You walk the Great Vehicle path, and because of this merit and these causes and conditions, you able to see all the Buddhas. But even though you seeing these World-Honored Ones now, you still can't see Śākyamuni Buddha's manifestation-bodies and the Many Treasures Buddha tower."


THE VOW TO SEE ŚĀKYAMUNI AND THE MANY TREASURES TOWER

When they hear this voice from empty space, they practice reciting the Great Vehicle scriptures even harder, even more diligent. And because they reciting these Mahāyāna equal-teaching scriptures, in their dreams they see Śākyamuni Buddha with the great assembly at Vulture Peak Mountain, preaching the Lotus Sutra, explaining the teaching of One True Reality.

The teaching tells them to confess, so they thirsting to see, they longing to see. They put their palms together and kneel down facing Vulture Peak Mountain and they say: "The Tathāgata, the Hero of the World, always remains in the world. Have mercy on me, show me your body!"

When they speak like this, they see Vulture Peak Mountain adorned with seven treasures, countless monks and great disciples in the Śrāvaka assembly. Treasure-trees standing in rows. The jeweled ground level and perfect. Wonderful jeweled lion-thrones spread out everywhere.

Śākyamuni Buddha sends out light from between his eyebrows. This light spreads throughout the ten directions, and keeps going past the ten directions into countless worlds beyond. Wherever this light reaches, the manifestation-body Śākyamuni Buddhas from all ten directions all gather at once like clouds coming together.

It's all described in the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Sutra—you can read it there.


THE GATHERING OF INFINITE BUDDHAS

Every manifestation-body Buddha—body the color of purple-gold, beautiful beyond measure, immeasurable size, sitting on lion-thrones. Ten billion, countless great Bodhisattvas serving as their assembly. Every Bodhisattva's practice the same as Universal Worthy's.

Like this throughout the ten directions—countless Buddhas with countless Bodhisattva assemblies, all the same.

When the great assembly is gathered, they see Śākyamuni Buddha—from every pore of his entire body, golden light shooting out. From every ray of light, ten billion transformation-Buddhas appearing. And all the manifestation-body Buddhas sending out the white-tuft light from between their eyebrows, the great mark of the supreme person. This light flows into the crown of Śākyamuni Buddha's head.

When they see this, all the manifestation-body Buddhas, from every pore of their bodies, send out golden light. In every ray of light, transformation-Buddhas numerous as the sands of the Ganges River times the number of atoms in the universe.


THE LIGHT THAT UNLOCKS PAST LIVES

Then Universal Worthy Bodhisattva sends out the great white-tuft light from between his eyebrows, and it enters the practitioner's mind. When it enters their heart, the practitioner suddenly remembers their past—they recall countless hundreds of thousands of previous lives when they received and upheld and read and recited Great Vehicle scriptures at the feet of innumerable Buddhas.

They see their former bodies clear and distinct, just like someone with the power to remember past lives, no different at all. Suddenly they wake up big-time, they understand deep, and they receive the revolving dhāraṇī. They receive hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of dhāraṇī-doors opening up.

Coming out of this samādhi, they see face-to-face all the manifestation-body Buddhas sitting on lion-seats under the treasure-trees. They also see the lapis-ground, and coming up out of empty space from the lower direction, there's clusters of lotus flowers rising up like fountains of light. Between every flower, there's Bodhisattvas numerous as atoms, sitting cross-legged. They also see Universal Worthy's manifestation-body Bodhisattvas in that crowd, praising the Great Vehicle.


THE BODHISATTVAS TEACH THE SIX MINDFULNESSES

All these Bodhisattvas, different mouths but speaking with one voice, they teach the practitioner how to purify the six sense-organs.

Some say: "You ought to be mindful of Buddha."

Some say: "You ought to be mindful of Dharma."

Some say: "You ought to be mindful of Sangha—the assembly."

Some say: "You ought to be mindful of precepts—moral conduct."

Some say: "You ought to be mindful of giving—generosity."

Some say: "You ought to be mindful of heaven—the celestial realms."

These six things—mindfulness of Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, precepts, giving, and heaven—these are the awakening-mind, these give birth to the Bodhisattva-path.

"Now you should go before all the Buddhas and reveal your former sins. Confess with all sincerity. Throughout countless ages, your eye-faculty, on account of causes and conditions, got greedy for all kinds of forms and colors. Because you attached to colors, you got greedy for all kinds of objects and dust. Because you loved that dust, you received a woman's body. Life after life, wherever you were born, you got confused and attached to forms and colors. Colors ruined your eyes, made you a slave to affection and love. Color sent you traveling through the three realms. This lowdown servant made you blind, made you unable to see.

"Now you reciting the Great Vehicle equal-teaching scriptures. These scriptures say the physical bodies of Buddhas in the ten directions don't perish. You now get to see them—is it really true or not? Your eye-faculty's unwholesomeness has hurt you plenty. Follow our words, turn toward all the Buddhas.

"Śākyamuni teaches: Speak out loud about all the faults and offenses your eye-faculty committed. May the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas with their wisdom and bright Dharma-water wash me clean, make me pure."
