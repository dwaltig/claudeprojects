THE BUDDHA SPEAKS THE SUTRA ON CONTEMPLATING UNIVERSAL WORTHY BODHISATTVA

A Complete Blues-Vernacular Interpretation

Also Known As: The Universal Worthy Sutra, The Sutra of Deep Merit and Virtue

Translated from Chinese into blues vernacular while preserving the complete meaning, structure, and spiritual power of the original Mahayana Buddhist scripture

OPENING: THUS HAVE I HEARD - WHEN THE BUDDHA SAID HE WAS LEAVING

This is what I heard, what come down to me, what got told:

One time—and this was a real time, not no made-up story-time—the Buddha was staying in the country of Vaiśālī, in that Great Forest Monastery, up in the Two-Story Teaching Hall where he used to preach.

And the Buddha, he gathered all them monks around him and he told them straight: "Three months from now, I'm going into final nirvāṇa. I'm leaving this world, brothers. My time here is done."

When the Venerable Ānanda heard this—Ānanda who'd been following the Buddha like a shadow, who'd remembered every word the Blessed One ever spoke—he rose up from his seat. He straightened out his robe. He put his palms together and joined his hands. He walked around the Buddha three times, clockwise, showing respect the old way. Then he bowed down low, got on his knees with both knees on the ground, put his palms together again, and he looked at the Tathāgata—just looked and looked, couldn't take his eyes off the Buddha, knowing the time was short.

And Elder Mahākāśyapa was there too—that old monk who'd been practicing hard since before most folks were born. And Maitreya Bodhisattva Mahāsattva, the one they say gonna be the next Buddha when his time comes—he was there too. They both rose up from their seats, put their palms together, made their respects, and gazed up at the Blessed One's face, drinking in the sight while they still could.

Then these three great beings—these three pillars of the Dharma—they spoke with different mouths but the same voice, and they said to the Buddha:

"World-Honored One, when the Tathāgata passes away and is gone from this world, how are living beings supposed to raise up the bodhisattva-mind? How they supposed to practice the Great Vehicle, them Mahāyāna equal-teaching scriptures? How they supposed to think correctly about the One True Reality? How they gonna keep from losing that supreme awakening-mind, that aspiration to buddhahood?

"And here's what we really want to know: How can people in the future—without cutting off their passions, without leaving behind the five desires of ordinary life—how can they get their sense-organs purified and their sins wiped clean? How can they get that pure, constant eye that their mama and daddy gave them when they were born—that original seeing—and while still living in the middle of the five desires, how can they see things beyond obstacles, see what's blocked from ordinary sight?"


THE BUDDHA'S ANSWER: I'VE TAUGHT BEFORE, BUT LET ME TEACH AGAIN

The Buddha said to Ānanda: "Listen close now, listen careful, and think good and hard about what I'm gonna say.

"When I was staying at Vulture Peak Mountain and other places, I already explained in detail the One True Path. I done broke it down, showed you the way. But now, here in this place, for the sake of living beings in future times—for folks who want to walk the Great Vehicle path, the supreme teaching, for people who want to learn the practices of Universal Worthy Bodhisattva, them practices that reach everywhere and miss nothing—I'm gonna tell you the method of remembrance and contemplation.

"Whether you actually see Universal Worthy or you don't see him with your physical eyes, this practice gonna wipe away your sins, gonna reduce that number, gonna make you clean. So now, for all of you, I'm gonna explain it fully, lay it all out."


WHO IS UNIVERSAL WORTHY AND WHERE HE COME FROM

"Ānanda, listen: Universal Worthy Bodhisattva—Samantabhadra, his name means 'Everywhere Auspicious,' 'All-Pervading Goodness'—he comes from a Buddha-land in the Eastern direction. That land is called the Pure and Wondrous Country, and the characteristics of that country, I already described in detail when I preached the Lotus Sutra. Today I'm just gonna give you the short version, the essential points.


WHO CAN PRACTICE THIS AND HOW LONG IT TAKES

"Ānanda, I'm talking now to monks and nuns, to laymen and laywomen practicing at home, to the eight classes of beings—dragons and spirits and all kinds of creatures—to every living being everywhere:

"If you reciting the Great Vehicle scriptures, if you practicing that Mahāyāna way, if you done raised up your intention to walk the Great Vehicle path, if you want to see Universal Worthy Bodhisattva's physical body, if you want to see the tower of Many Treasures Buddha, if you want to see Śākyamuni Buddha and all his manifestation-bodies spread throughout the cosmos, if you want to get your six sense-faculties purified and clean—then you need to learn this contemplation I'm about to teach.

"This contemplation practice got the power to remove all kinds of obstacles and barriers. It lets you see supreme, wonderful forms and visions. You don't need to enter deep samādhi-trance for this—you don't got to be no meditation master. Just by reciting and upholding these words, just by focusing your mind single-pointedly, just by practicing with concentration, keeping your thoughts following one after another without leaving the Great Vehicle teaching—if you do this for one day, or up to twenty-one days straight, you gonna see Universal Worthy.

"Now some folks got heavier obstacles than others—that's just how it is, that's karma working. For people with serious barriers, it might take forty-nine days—seven weeks—before they see him.

"Some people got it even harder, their burdens even thicker: they might not see him until this present life is finished, might be the next life when the vision comes. Some might take two lifetimes before they see. Some might take three lifetimes. See, everyone's karma is different, everyone's past actions created different results, everyone's karmic retribution ain't the same, so the teaching comes out different for different people. That's why I'm explaining it various ways.


THE INFINITE SIZE OF UNIVERSAL WORTHY

"Now let me tell you about Universal Worthy Bodhisattva himself: His body—you can't measure it, can't put a number to it, goes on forever. His voice—you can't measure it, infinite in all directions. His form and his appearance—you can't measure them, boundless beyond conception. Everything about him is unlimited, you understand? Immeasurable. Without boundary.

"But when he wants to come to this world here, when he wants to visit this Jambudvīpa continent where we human beings live with all our suffering, he's got to use his sovereign spiritual powers. He's got to transform himself, shrink himself down, make himself fit into a realm that's too small to hold his true vastness.

"Why? Because people in this Jambudvīpa world, we carrying three kinds of heavy obstacles that weigh us down like chains, that blind us like cataracts on the eye. So Universal Worthy, he uses his wisdom-power to transform his appearance, and he manifests riding on a white elephant—an elephant white as fresh snow, white as pure light, white as liberation itself.


THE SIX-TUSKED WHITE ELEPHANT - A LIVING CHARIOT OF LIGHT

"This elephant, let me paint the picture for you so you can see it in your mind's eye:

"This elephant got six tusks—six ivory tusks gleaming and radiant. He stands on seven supports touching the ground—seven points of contact. And under each one of them seven supports, a lotus flower blooms up from the earth, seven lotus flowers big as chariot wheels, pure and perfect, holding him up, keeping him above the dust and dirt of this world.

"The elephant's color? White. But not just regular white—we talking about a white so pure, so bright, that crystal glass looks dirty next to it, that snow-covered mountains look gray and stained in comparison. Can't nothing in this world compare to that whiteness. The finest white jade, the clearest glass, the whitest snow on the highest mountain peak—all that ain't nothing, ain't even close, when you put it next to this elephant's radiance.

"How big is this elephant? Listen: Four hundred fifty yojanas long. Now a yojana, that's the distance an army can march in a day—we talking miles and miles, we talking a distance you couldn't walk in a week. Four hundred fifty of those. That's thousands and thousands of miles, son, longer than any road you ever walked, longer than any journey you could imagine.

"And four hundred yojanas tall—that's the height. So high you'd break your neck trying to look up and see the top. Tall as the sky seems when you lying on your back looking up.

"Now listen close to this part: On the tip of each one of them six tusks, there's a bathing pool. Six pools of pure water, clean and clear. In every single pool, fourteen lotus flowers are growing, and these flowers are as big as the pools themselves—massive, magnificent blooms.

"When them flowers open up, when them petals spread wide, they're like the king of all the trees in heaven, like that wish-fulfilling tree they talk about in the celestial realms. Glorious. Spreading. Beautiful beyond description.

"And sitting on top of each one of them flowers, there's a jade maiden—a heavenly woman, beautiful past the point of beautiful, making them regular heaven-girls look plain and ordinary. Her face glowing red like sunset, like the color of joy itself. Her beauty the kind that makes your heart stop and catch in your chest.

"And in her hands—she ain't holding nothing earthly, nothing ordinary—in her hands, naturally appearing without nobody making them, there's five harps. Five golden harps that appeared just because she's there. And surrounding each harp, five hundred different musical instruments keeping it company, making harmony, creating a symphony of sound. Five hundred instruments for each harp, and five harps for each maiden, and fourteen maidens on each tusk, and six tusks altogether—you do the math, that's more music than this world has ever heard.

"And there's five hundred birds—ducks and geese and mandarin ducks, all kinds of waterfowl—and these birds ain't natural-colored, they colored like living jewels. Precious-stone colors: emerald green and ruby red and sapphire blue, diamond white and topaz gold. These jewel-colored birds are perched in the flower-leaves, in the petals and stems, and they singing songs no human throat could ever make, melodies that don't exist in this world of suffering.


THE LOTUS ON THE ELEPHANT'S TRUNK - THE FLOWER WAITING FOR YOU

"Now the elephant's trunk—he's holding a lotus flower in his trunk, carrying it gentle and careful. The stem of this lotus, it's the color of a red pearl, deep crimson like blood that's been blessed, like wine that's been sanctified. The flower itself is gold—pure gold, radiant gold—but here's the thing: it ain't opened yet. It's still closed up, still waiting, petals folded tight.

"Waiting for what? Waiting for you to do your practice. Waiting for you to confess your wrongs. Waiting for you to come clean.

"So when the practitioner sees all this vision, what they supposed to do? They got to confess again, got to repent again, got to look deep in their heart and bring up everything they done wrong, got to think hard and serious about that Great Vehicle teaching. And they can't let their mind rest, can't slack off, can't let up on the practice.

"And when they do that—when they really do that with sincerity and devotion—the flower opens. That golden lotus spreads its petals, and golden light comes pouring out like sunrise, like the first day of creation.

"The platform of the lotus, it's made of that deep-red maṇi-jewel they call 'true ruby gem' or 'real cinnabar stone.' The flower's garlands are made of wonderful Brahma-maṇi jewels—treasures from the highest heaven. The flower's stamens are made of vajra-diamond jewels, hard and indestructible, clear and radiant.

"And sitting right there on that lotus platform, there's a transformation-Buddha—a manifested Buddha sitting in meditation posture. And all around him, sitting on the stamens, there's crowds of bodhisattvas, all manifested, all real, all perfect. All of them transformation-bodies, but transformation don't mean fake—means manifested just for you, appeared just for this teaching, real as rain.


THE GOLDEN LIGHT TRAVELING THROUGH THE ELEPHANT

"And from that transformation-Buddha's forehead—right between his eyebrows where the wisdom-eye opens—a ray of golden light shoots out. This light, it goes right into the elephant's trunk. Travels through that trunk like water through a pipe, like electricity through a wire.

"Light comes out the trunk and enters the elephant's eyes. Both eyes fill with golden radiance. Comes out the eyes and enters the elephant's ears. Both ears illuminated with the light of teaching. Comes out the ears and shines upward onto the top of the elephant's head, and when it gets there, it transforms itself into a golden platform, a golden stage, sitting there on the elephant's crown like a hat made of light, like a crown made of dawn.

"On top of the elephant's head now, there's three transformation-people appeared, manifested just like that. One of them is holding a golden wheel—the wheel of the Dharma, the wheel of teaching, the wheel that turns and never stops turning. One is holding a maṇi-pearl—that wish-fulfilling jewel that grants what the heart truly needs, not what it thinks it wants but what it really needs. One is holding a vajra-staff, a diamond-hard staff, indestructible and powerful, and he lifts it up like he's about to touch the elephant with it, like he's about to give a signal.

"Soon as he touches that elephant with the vajra-staff, the elephant can walk. He starts moving. But listen—and this is important—his feet don't touch the ground. He ain't walking on earth like you and me, ain't stepping on dirt and grass. He's stepping on emptiness, walking on air, walking on nothing, seven feet above the ground. Levitating. Floating. Moving through space like space is solid.

"And everywhere his feet would have touched if he was walking normal, there's footprints anyway. Footprints floating in the air, hanging there in space. And in every footprint, you can see the marks clearly: the Dharma-wheel, the thousand-spoked wheel with its hub and its rim, complete and perfect, every spoke visible, every detail clear.

"And between each spoke of each wheel, a great lotus flower springs up into existence. Just appears. And on each lotus flower, another transformation-elephant appears—same as the great elephant but smaller, also with seven supports touching the air.

"And these transformation-elephants, they follow the great elephant wherever he goes. They walk when he walks, they step when he steps, they stop when he stops. Every time the great elephant lifts his foot, every time he puts it down, seven thousand more elephants come into being, manifesting out of his merit, out of his virtue, out of his spiritual power. Seven thousand elephants following behind like an entourage, like a royal procession, like a congregation of the faithful marching toward home.


THE ELEPHANT'S TRUNK LOTUS AND THE GOLDEN SADDLE

"Now that trunk, remember—it's holding that lotus, and now the lotus is the color of a red lotus in full bloom. On top of that lotus, there's a transformation-Buddha radiating light from between his eyebrows. The light is golden, pure gold, color of enlightenment.

"Just like before, this golden light enters the elephant's trunk. Travels through. Comes out and enters the elephant's eyes. Travels through. Comes out and enters the elephant's ears. But this time, when the light comes out of the ears, it flows to the elephant's neck, rises up gradually like water finding its level, climbs slowly up the elephant's back, and there, on that broad white back, it transforms into a golden saddle.

"This saddle is decorated with seven kinds of treasures—gold and silver, lapis lazuli and crystal, agate and ruby and pearl. All kinds of precious ornaments making it splendid, making it beautiful beyond measure.

"On the four sides of the saddle, there's seven-jeweled pillars rising up, four pillars at the four directions. These pillars are all decorated and adorned with every kind of jewel, and they holding up a pavilion—a jeweled pavilion, a palace made of light and treasure, a canopy of liberation.

"In the center of that pavilion, there's a seven-jeweled lotus flower. The stamens of this flower are made from a hundred different treasures all working together, all harmonizing. The platform of the lotus—the place where you'd sit if you was sitting on it—it's made from the great maṇi-jewel, the supreme gem, the wish-fulfilling treasure that's worth more than all the wealth in the world.

"And on that lotus, sitting in the full cross-legged meditation posture, both legs crossed, both feet up, sitting firm and stable and unmoving—here he is now, here he comes, here's what you been practicing to see—there's a Bodhisattva.

"His name is Universal Worthy. Pǔxián in the Chinese tongue. Samantabhadra in the Sanskrit language. The one whose practice extends everywhere, whose virtue reaches everything, whose vows miss nothing, whose compassion excludes nobody.


UNIVERSAL WORTHY HIMSELF - THE VISION ARRIVES AT LAST

"His body is the color of white jade, glowing soft like moonlight, radiant like pearl, pure like the first snow of winter. Fifty different kinds of light stream from him continuously, never stopping. Fifty different colors making up the halo around his neck—red and gold and blue and white and every color that exists, plus colors that don't have names, colors that ain't never been seen in this world.

"From every pore of his body—every single pore, hundreds of thousands of pores—golden light flows out like water from a spring, like rivers of dawn, like liquid sunshine. And at the tip of each ray of light, there's countless transformation-Buddhas appearing, manifesting, teaching. And around every Buddha, there's crowds of transformation-Bodhisattvas, all keeping them Buddhas company, all making an assembly, all forming a sangha in the sky.

"And Universal Worthy, he comes walking—walking slow and peaceful, calm and easy like he got all the time in the world, like rushing ain't necessary, like hurry don't mean nothing in the realm of truth. As he moves, he's raining down great jeweled flowers, precious blossoms falling like snow, like blessing, like grace made visible.

"He walks right up to where the practitioner is sitting. Comes right to where you are, wherever you are. Right up to your spot. Comes to meet you.

"The elephant opens his mouth. And up there on them tusks, in them bathing pools, them jade maidens start playing their instruments, start singing. The sound is subtle—so subtle you almost can't hear it, but when you hear it, it's the most beautiful thing you ever heard. Fine like silk, sweet like honey, clear like spring water. Beautiful in a way that makes you want to weep, that makes your heart break open with joy and longing.

"And what they singing about? What's the subject of their song? They praising the Great Vehicle. They testifying about the One True Path, the single reality that all the different teachings point to. They singing about the way home, the road to liberation, the path to freedom. They bearing witness to the truth.


WHAT THE PRACTITIONER DOES WHEN THE VISION COMES

"When the practitioner sees this vision—when you see all this that I'm describing—joy fills up your heart like floodwater rising, like a river overflowing its banks. Your heart can't hold all the happiness, all the relief, all the gratitude. You feel like you been traveling in the desert and just found water, like you been lost in the dark and just seen light.

"You bow down low. You pay respect. You make prostrations. And you want to read them deep scriptures even more now, you want to recite them sacred texts, you want to study that Dharma. You bow to the Buddhas in all ten directions—East and West, North and South, the four corners in between, up above and down below. All the countless Awakened Ones scattered throughout infinite space like stars in the sky. You bow to every one of them in your mind.

"You bow to that Many Treasures stupa, that tower where the ancient Buddha sits in eternal meditation. You bow to Śākyamuni Buddha, the sage of the Śākya clan, the teacher of this world. You bow to Universal Worthy and all them great bodhisattvas, all them beings dedicated to saving others.

"And then you make a vow. You speak it out loud, you say it clear, you make it firm. You say:

"'If I got blessings from my past lives, if my karma from previous existences is such that I'm supposed to see Universal Worthy, if my merit has ripened to the point where I can have this vision—then please, let him whose name means Everywhere Auspicious, let him who's called Universal Goodness, let Samantabhadra Bodhisattva show me his physical form. Let me see him with these eyes my mama gave me. Let me see him clear and plain, not in my imagination but in truth.'

"After you make that vow, you practice six times every day and every night. What's the six times? Morning when the sun rises. Noon when it's high. Evening when it sets. Midnight when the world sleeps. The deep night before dawn. And dawn itself when darkness breaks. Six times a day, you bow to the Buddhas in all ten directions.

"You practice the ritual of repentance and confession, coming clean about all your wrongs, all your faults, all your failings. You recite them Great Vehicle scriptures out loud—recite them till you know them, till they part of you. You read them Mahāyāna texts with your eyes and take them into your mind. You think deep about what the Great Vehicle means—not just the words but the meaning, not just the meaning but the truth behind the meaning. You keep your mind on Great Vehicle practices day and night. You honor and support folks who uphold the Great Vehicle teaching—you respect them, you help them, you make their way easier.

"And here's the hardest part, the part that goes against everything your ego wants to do: You got to look at every single person like they Buddha himself. Every person you see—the good ones and the bad ones, the ones you like and the ones you don't, the clean ones and the dirty ones, the respectable ones and the disreputable ones—you look at every one of them and see Buddha-nature, see the seed of enlightenment, see the potential for awakening.

"And every living being—not just humans but animals too, insects too, every creature that has life—you look at them like they your own mama and daddy, like they the ones who gave you life, who nursed you when you were helpless, who cared for you when you couldn't care for yourself. You look at all beings with that kind of tenderness, that kind of gratitude, that kind of love.


UNIVERSAL WORTHY'S WHITE LIGHT - THE SURE SIGN HE'S COMING

"When you thinking like that, when your mind is right like that, when your heart has opened up like that—then Universal Worthy Bodhisattva, from between his eyebrows, sends out the great white light. This is the light of the supreme person, the light that only Buddhas and great bodhisattvas have. The white tuft of hair that spirals to the right, the úrṇā that marks the enlightened ones.

"When this light appears, when it shines forth, Universal Worthy Bodhisattva's body looks so dignified, so excellent, like a mountain made of purple gold standing against the sky. Perfect and subtle. Excellent beyond words, beyond description, beyond conception.

"He's got all thirty-two major marks of a great being. Every single one of them is present and complete. The wheel-marks on his feet. The webbed fingers and toes. The long arms that reach past his knees. The broad tongue that could cover his whole face. The pure voice like Brahma's voice. Every mark is there.

"From every pore of his body, great light is shining out, illuminating everything. This light falls on the great white elephant and makes him turn golden—white becomes gold, purity becomes radiance. All them transformation-elephants turn golden too, thousands of elephants all turning the color of enlightenment. All them transformation-bodhisattvas turn golden too, all bathed in the same light.

"And the golden light keeps spreading, keeps going, don't stop at no boundary. It lights up the Eastern direction first, then keeps going, countless worlds in the East all turning golden, all bathed in Buddha-light. Then South, then West, then North—the four main directions all golden now. Then the four intermediate directions—Northeast, Southeast, Southwest, Northwest—all golden. Then up above to the highest heaven, then down below to the deepest hell—every direction, every world, the whole cosmos bathed in this golden light. Everything the same color, everything unified, everything showing the color of dawn, the color of awakening, the color of freedom.


TEN DIRECTIONS FILL WITH UNIVERSAL WORTHY BODHISATTVAS

"And then—oh, Lord, then you see something that makes your mind almost break from wonder—in each direction, every single direction, there appears one Bodhisattva riding on a six-tusked white elephant-king. Each one looks just exactly like Universal Worthy, can't tell them apart, can't say which is the original and which is the copy, all equal, all identical, all perfect.

"The ten directions fill up with countless, infinite, immeasurable transformation-elephants filling all of space. Wherever you look, there's Universal Worthy. North and South, East and West, up and down, near and far, everywhere you can see and everywhere you can't see—all full of bodhisattvas on white elephants, all teaching the Dharma, all saving beings.

"All this is happening by Universal Worthy Bodhisattva's spiritual penetration power, by his supernatural ability, by his mastery of the way things are. He's manifesting like this so that the person reciting the scripture can see it all, can witness the whole thing with their own eyes, can know for certain that the teaching is true.

"When the practitioner sees all these bodhisattvas, when they see this vision of infinite Universal Worthies filling the cosmos, their body and mind fill up with joy—joy like they never known before, joy beyond measure, joy that's pure and clean and free from the taint of desire. They bow down, they make respects, they prostrate themselves, and they say with all their heart:

"'You who have great compassion and great lovingkindness, you who feel for the suffering of all living beings, please have mercy on me. Please take pity on this poor confused person. Please teach me the Dharma. Please show me the way home.'

"And when they say this—when they speak from the heart like that—all them bodhisattvas, all of them together, different mouths but speaking with one voice, like a choir that never rehearsed but somehow knows the same song—they all start preaching the pure Great Vehicle teachings. They speak verses and praises. They honor the practitioner, encourage them, lift them up, tell them they on the right road, tell them keep going, tell them don't turn back.

"This right here—what I just described—this is what we call the 'beginning contemplation of Universal Worthy Bodhisattva.' This is the first境界 (jìngjiè)—the first stage of spiritual experience, the initial境界, the starting place of seeing what's real, the threshold of the vision, the doorway to the truth.


IN DREAMS UNIVERSAL WORTHY TEACHES WHAT YOU FORGOT

"After the practitioner sees all this, they keep their mind on the Great Vehicle day and night, never letting go, never putting it down. Mahāyāna becomes their food, their water, their breath. They can't stop thinking about it, can't stop contemplating it, it's always there in the back of their mind even when they doing other things.

"And then something beautiful happens: Even in their sleep, even in their dreams, they see Universal Worthy coming to teach them the Dharma. The teaching in dreams is just as clear as when they're awake—ain't no difference between the dream-teaching and the waking-teaching. Both real. Both true. Both powerful.

"Universal Worthy comes and comforts them, settles their heart, calms their worry, and he says gentle-like:

"'What you been reciting—you forgot this sentence right here. You skipped over this line. You missed this verse. Let me remind you. Let me help you remember.'

"And when the practitioner hears what Universal Worthy says, they understand the deep meaning instantly. The meaning opens up inside them like a flower blooming fast-motion. They grasp the profound truth. They remember it and they don't forget this time. It stays with them, becomes part of them.

"Day after day it goes like this. Their mind gets sharper, clearer, stronger. Their memory improves. Their understanding deepens. The fog burns off, the confusion clears away, the ignorance starts dissolving.

"Universal Worthy Bodhisattva teaches them to remember the Buddhas in all ten directions. He says: 'Think on the Buddhas. Hold them in your mind. Call them by name. Know they there even when you can't see them. Remember they always present, always teaching, always helping.'

"Following Universal Worthy's teaching, the practitioner makes their mind right, makes their thoughts correct. They practice right-mindfulness, right-thinking. And gradually, little by little, step by step, with their mind's eye—not their physical eye but the eye of wisdom, the eye of meditation, the eye of insight—they start seeing the Buddhas in the Eastern direction.

"Bodies the color of gold, radiant like sunrise, beautiful like the first morning of the world. Dignified and excellent and subtle beyond words.

"They see one Buddha standing there in the East, clear as day. Then they see another Buddha next to him. Then another. Like stars coming out at twilight—first one, then two, then more and more till the whole sky is full of light.

"And gradually, steadily, their vision expanding, their perception growing, they see all the Buddhas throughout the entire Eastern direction. Every single one of them. The whole eastern sky filled with enlightened ones, shining like ten thousand suns rising at once.

"And because their mind is getting sharp and quick, because their concentration is strong, because their merit is ripening, they come to see not just the Buddhas in the East but the Buddhas in all ten directions. The whole assembly of Awakened Ones throughout infinite space. Everywhere they look, Buddhas. Everywhere they don't look, Buddhas. The cosmos full of enlightened ones like the ocean full of water.


THE BUDDHAS APPEAR BUT NOT CLEARLY YET

"When they see all these Buddhas, when they witness this vision of infinite enlightenment, their heart fills up with happiness like a cup that's overflowing. They say with joy and wonder:

"'It's because of the Great Vehicle that I got to see this great being Universal Worthy. It's because I been studying the Mahāyāna that this bodhisattva appeared to me. It's because of Universal Worthy's spiritual power that I now get to see all these Buddhas. One led to the other, and the other led to this. It's all connected, all one teaching, all one truth.'

"But even though they seeing the Buddhas, even though the vision is there, they ain't seeing them real clear yet. You understand? The vision is still a little cloudy, a little uncertain, a little unstable.

"When they close their eyes, they see the Buddhas plain as day, vivid and detailed. But when they open their eyes, the vision fades away, disappears like morning mist when the sun gets high, like dew evaporating off the grass.

"This troubles them. They want the vision to be stable, to be permanent, to be clear whether their eyes are open or closed. So they speak. They say this, and they prostrate their whole body as they speak—forehead touching the ground, two hands flat on the earth, two knees bent, all five points of the body making contact with the ground in full surrender, complete humility—and they bow to the Buddhas throughout the ten directions like that, bowing to the North and South and East and West and the directions in between and above and below.

"After they bow to all them Buddhas with full-body prostrations, they kneel down proper, get on both knees, put their palms together in front of their heart, and they speak like this, they pray like this, they confess like this:

"'You Buddhas, you World-Honored Ones, you got the Ten Powers that nothing can resist, the Four Fearlessnesses that let you teach anywhere to anyone, the Eighteen Uncommon Qualities that only Buddhas have, the great compassion that feels the suffering of all beings, the great lovingkindness that wants happiness for everyone, the Three Ways of Mindfulness that keep you balanced and pure.

"'You stay forever in the world, never really leaving even when you seem to go. Among all forms and bodies, you the finest form, the supreme form, the color beyond all colors.

"'What sin I got? What wrong I done? What karma is blocking me that I can't see you clearly? What's wrong with me that the vision comes and goes, that I see you with eyes closed but lose you with eyes open? What obstacle is in my way?'


THE CONFESSION THAT BRINGS CLARITY

"After they say this, after they ask this question, they confess again. They go deeper into repentance. They dig down into their heart and bring up everything—all the dirt, all the shame, all the secret wrongs they ain't never told nobody. They confess till they clean, till all that accumulated filth from countless lifetimes is washed away, till the stains are gone, till they standing naked and pure before the truth.

"And when their confession is pure, when their repentance is sincere, when their heart is really clean—then Universal Worthy Bodhisattva appears before them again, manifesting more clearly than before, more stable than before, more constant than before.

"He's there when they standing. He's there when they walking around. He's there when they sitting down to eat or study. He's there when they lying down to sleep. He never leaves their side, not for a moment, not even in dreams. Especially in dreams. Even in sleep, he's always there teaching the Dharma, explaining the truth, guiding them home.

"When the person wakes up from these dreams, they filled with what the scripture calls 'Dharma-joy'—happiness that comes from the teaching, bliss that arises from truth, a joy that's pure and clean and don't depend on external things, a happiness that can't be taken away.

"Like this, day and night, day after day, night after night, for three weeks straight—twenty-one days without stopping, without slacking off, without letting up—they practice and they see and they learn.

"And then, after twenty-one days of this intense practice, they receive the dhāraṇī. They get what's called the 'turning dhāraṇī' or 'revolving dhāraṇī'—a kind of spiritual memory and understanding that spins like a wheel and never loses nothing, that holds everything and lets nothing slip away.

"Because they got this dhāraṇī power, all the wonderful teachings that Buddhas and Bodhisattvas preach, all the profound Dharma that gets explained, all the subtle meanings that get revealed—they can remember it all, hold onto it all, never let it slip away. Their memory becomes perfect. Their understanding becomes complete. The teachings stick with them like their own name.

"They also start dreaming about the Seven Buddhas of the ancient past—Vipaśyin, Śikhin, Viśvabhū, Krakucchanda, Kanakamuni, Kāśyapa, and especially Śākyamuni Buddha, the seventh and most recent, the one who taught in this world, the sage who walked in India and showed the way.

"These Buddhas, all these World-Honored Ones, they each come in dreams and teach. Each one of them praises the Great Vehicle scriptures, lifts them up, honors them, says this is the path, this is the way, this is how you get home.


CONFESSION BEFORE ALL BUDDHAS - SPEAKING THE DARK SECRETS

"Then—and this is where the practice goes even deeper—the practitioner confesses yet again, bows yet again to the Buddhas throughout the ten directions. After bowing to them ten-direction Buddhas with full sincerity, with complete devotion, Universal Worthy Bodhisattva stands right there in front of them, close enough to touch, real as rain, and he teaches them to speak about all their past-life karma, all the causes and conditions from previous existences, all the seeds they planted in former lives that are now bearing fruit.

"Universal Worthy says to them:

"'It's time to confess your dark and evil deeds. Time to speak out loud about all your sins in the presence of all the World-Honored Ones. Open your mouth and reveal what you done. Don't hide nothing. Don't hold nothing back. Bring it all into the light.'

"And when they confess like that, when they really lay it all out, when they tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth—right then and there, at that very moment, they receive a samādhi. Not just any meditation, but a specific concentration called 'Buddhas Appearing Before You'—諸佛現前三昧 (zhū fó xiàn qián sānmèi).

"This is the meditation where you actually see the Buddhas standing there in front of your face. Not in your imagination. Not as a visualization. But really there, really present, as real as the person sitting next to you. The Buddhas become visible, tangible, present.

"When they get this samādhi, when they enter this meditation-concentration, they see the Eastern direction clearly. They see Akṣobhya Buddha—the Immovable One, the Unshakable One—and they see his Buddha-land called Abhirati, the World of Joy, the Land of Delight. They see it clear and distinct and detailed, like looking at something right in front of them, like looking at their own hand, like looking at something they could reach out and touch.

"And it's like this in all ten directions. They see the Buddhas and their supreme, pure lands in every direction. The Southern direction: they see it clear. The Western direction: they see it distinct. The Northern direction: they see it detailed. The intermediate directions: all visible. Up and down: all clear. Every direction, they see the Buddhas and their purified worlds, their perfected lands, their realms of liberation.


THE VAJRA-MAN WHO PURIFIES THE SIX SENSES

"After they see all ten direction Buddhas like this, after they witness the Pure Lands in every direction, they have a dream. In this dream, they see there's a vajra-person—a diamond-hard being, a adamantine man—standing on top of the white elephant's head.

"This vajra-person is holding a vajra-staff, a diamond-scepter, an indestructible rod. And he reaches down with this staff and he touches all six of the practitioner's sense-organs with it, one by one, deliberately, carefully:

"He touches their eyes—the organ of seeing, the faculty of vision.
He touches their ears—the organ of hearing, the faculty of sound.
He touches their nose—the organ of smelling, the faculty of scent.
He touches their tongue—the organ of tasting, the faculty of flavor.
He touches their body—the organ of touching, the faculty of sensation.
He touches their mind—the organ of thinking, the faculty of consciousness.

"Touches all six roots with the diamond-hard truth, with the indestructible reality, with the vajra that cuts through all illusion.

"After he touches the six roots like this, Universal Worthy Bodhisattva teaches the practitioner the method for confessing and purifying the six sense-organs. He explains the way to make the six roots clean, to wash away all the pollution that's accumulated there, all the attachment and aversion and confusion that's stuck to those faculties like dirt on a window, like dust on a mirror.

"He says: 'You need to confess like this for one day, or all the way up to seven days. Practice this confession meditation. Speak out your faults. Acknowledge your failings. Repent your misuse of the senses.'

"And because of the power of that 'Buddhas Appearing Before You' samādhi, because Universal Worthy Bodhisattva's teaching adorns and supports the practice, because the Dharma is working in them now—gradually, bit by bit, the practitioner's faculties start to purify:

"Their ears gradually start hearing sounds beyond the normal human range. They hear through obstacles. They hear through walls and mountains. They hear what's being said far away. They hear the subtle teachings whispered by spirits. They hear the Dharma being preached in other worlds. This is called the 'purified ear-faculty' or 'divine ear.'

"Their eyes gradually start seeing things beyond normal sight. They see through obstacles. They see past darkness and distance. They see beings in other realms. They see what's hidden behind walls. They see things far away as if they're close. This is called the 'purified eye-faculty' or 'divine eye.'

"Their nose gradually smells fragrances beyond the normal range. They smell the perfume of virtue from far away. They smell the stench of evil even when it's hidden. They smell the incense offerings made in distant temples. They smell the aroma of liberation. This is called the 'purified nose-faculty.'

"It's all explained in more detail in the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower Sutra—you can read it there if you want the full teaching. But this is the essence of it.


THE JOY OF PURIFICATION - SIX ROOTS CLEAN AT LAST

"When you get them six roots purified like this, when all six sense-faculties become clean and clear and unpolluted, your body and mind fill up with joy. There ain't no evil marks on you no more, no signs of wickedness, no traces of corruption.

"Your mind becomes pure Dharma—nothing but teaching, nothing but truth, nothing but the way things really are. Your thoughts ain't jumping around no more, ain't chasing after this and that, ain't getting caught in delusion.

"Your mind matches up with the teaching now, corresponds perfectly with the law of reality, aligns with the truth of things. What the Dharma says is what you see. What the Buddhas teach is what you understand. There's no gap no more between the teaching and your experience.

"And then—because one good thing leads to another, because merit builds on merit, because purity attracts purity—you receive hundreds, thousands, millions, billions of dhāraṇīs. Countless turning-and-holding spells, infinite memory-doors that never close, boundless methods of retaining the Dharma without forgetting.

"You see hundreds, thousands, millions, billions, countless Buddhas—more Awakened Ones than you could count if you spent a lifetime counting. Infinite Buddhas all throughout space, past and present and future, near and far, visible everywhere you look and everywhere you don't look.

"And all these World-Honored Ones, every last one of them, every single Buddha in every direction—they all stretch out their right hand toward you and they touch your head. They rub the crown of your head with their palm. This is what they do to show affection, to give blessing, to transmit the Dharma, to pass on the truth.

"And as they touch your head, they speak. They say to you:

"'Well done! Well done! You who walk the Great Vehicle path, you who practice the Mahāyāna way! Well done, you who raise up the great adorning aspiration, the vast vow to save all beings! Well done, you who keep your mind on the Great Vehicle day and night without forgetting!

"'We too—all of us Buddhas standing here—when we first raised the awakening-mind way back in the ancient past, when we first aspired to buddhahood countless eons ago, we were just like you. We were earnest like you. We were sincere like you. We were diligent like you. We didn't let up, didn't slack off, didn't give up even when it was hard.

"'Because we walked that Great Vehicle path in our former lives, because we practiced the Mahāyāna way, because we didn't turn back even when the road was rough—that's why now we have accomplished this pure body of complete and universal perfect knowledge. That's why we're Buddhas now. That's why we're Awakened. That's why we're free.

"'You too—you're on the same path we walked. You got to keep practicing diligent. Can't slack off now. Can't get lazy. Can't think you've arrived when you still got road to travel. Keep going. Keep walking. Keep practicing.

"'This Great Vehicle scripture here—this text you're reciting, this teaching you're studying—this is the treasure-house of all the Buddhas. This is where the jewels are kept. This is where the wealth is stored.

"'This is the eye of all the Buddhas in the past, present, and future. The ten directions and the three times—all the Buddhas everywhere and everywhen—this is what they see with. This Dharma is their vision.

"'This teaching gives birth to all the Tathāgatas in the three periods of time. The Buddhas of the past were born from this Dharma. The Buddhas of the present are born from this Dharma. The Buddhas of the future will be born from this Dharma. This is the womb that produces enlightenment. This is the seed of awakening.

"'The person who upholds this scripture, who recites these words, who practices this teaching—that person is upholding the Buddha's very body. That person is performing the Buddha's work in the world. That person is carrying on the Buddha's activity.

"'You should know—this kind of person, they are sent by all the Buddhas. They are messengers of enlightenment. They are ambassadors of the Dharma. They are covered and protected by the robes of all the Tathāgatas—the Buddha's own robe is wrapped around them, sheltering them, keeping them safe.

"'They are the true Dharma-children of all the Tathāgatas. Not children by blood, but children by truth. Not heirs of the body, but heirs of the teaching. The real sons and daughters of the Buddha.

"'You, walking the Great Vehicle like this—you're making sure the Dharma-seed doesn't get cut off. You're keeping the teaching-line going. You're preserving the lineage. You're maintaining the transmission. Because of people like you, the Buddha's teaching will continue. The light won't go out. The truth won't be lost.

"'Now—look carefully. Look with your whole attention. Look to the East. Observe the Buddhas there. See what I'm showing you.'


THE PURE LANDS APPEAR - LANDS FLAT AS YOUR HAND

"When the Buddhas say this, when they give this instruction, the practitioner looks to the Eastern direction with concentrated attention, with purified vision, with the divine eye that's been opened through practice.

"And they see—in the Eastern direction, in all them countless worlds spread out like grains of sand—the ground is level and flat. Perfectly flat. Flat like the palm of your hand when you hold it out straight. Smooth like glass. Even like a calm lake.

"There ain't no piles of dirt, no hills rising up, no valleys sinking down, no mountains blocking the view. No thorn-bushes to scratch you, no rough places to trip you up, no obstacles to stumble over. Everything smooth. Everything level. Everything perfect.

"The ground is made of vaidūrya—that's lapis lazuli, that deep blue precious stone, blue like the sky at twilight, blue like the ocean in deep water, radiant and translucent and pure. With borders of gold running through it, golden lines marking out patterns, creating beauty, showing the way.

"The worlds in all ten directions are just the same. North like the East. South like the West. Every direction showing the same purity, the same perfection, the same level ground. The whole cosmos transformed into a Pure Land, into a Buddha-field, into a realm of liberation.

"When they see this purified ground, they also see treasure-trees. These treasure-trees are tall and excellent, magnificent and beautiful. Five thousand yojanas high—that's tens of thousands of miles, that's trees tall as mountains, tall enough to touch the sky, tall enough to reach into heaven.

"These trees are constantly producing gold and silver from their branches. Seven kinds of precious adornments hang from them like fruit, like leaves, like blossoms. Jewels growing on trees the way apples grow on apple trees, the way flowers bloom on flowering trees.

"Under these trees, naturally appearing without anyone building them or making them, there's treasure lion-thrones. Thrones fit for a king. Thrones fit for a Buddha. Seats of authority and teaching.

"Each lion-throne is twenty yojanas high—that's hundreds of miles tall, that's a throne you'd need to climb for days to reach the top. And from these thrones, a hundred kinds of jewel-light shine out constantly, radiating, illuminating, blessing everything around them.

"All these trees and all these treasure-thrones—on each throne, naturally appearing just like the thrones themselves, there's five hundred white elephants. And on each elephant, there's Universal Worthy Bodhisattva sitting in meditation, teaching the Dharma, saving beings.


A PRAYER BEFORE THE THRONES

"When the practitioner sees this vision, when they witness these countless manifestations of Universal Worthy, they bow to all these bodhisattva-forms and they say with honesty and confusion:

"'What sin I got? What karma is still blocking me? I can see the jeweled ground now—it's beautiful. I can see the jeweled thrones—they're magnificent. I can see the jeweled trees—they're wonderful. But I don't see the Buddhas sitting on the thrones. The thrones are there but they empty. What's wrong with me that I see the seats but not the ones who should be sitting in them?'

"Soon as they speak these words, soon as this prayer leaves their lips—right then, at that very moment—on every single throne, a World-Honored One appears. A Buddha manifests. Dignified and excellent and subtle, perfect in every way, sitting on the treasure-throne in full lotus posture, radiant and teaching and present.

"When they see all these Buddhas, when the vision finally completes itself, when the thrones that were empty now filled with enlightened ones—their mind fills with great happiness, with immeasurable joy, with a bliss that's pure and clean.

"They recite and study the Great Vehicle scriptures even harder now, even more diligently, even more devotedly. They can't get enough of the Dharma. They thirsty for the teaching. They hungry for the truth.

"Because of the Great Vehicle's power, because of the merit they've accumulated through practice, a voice comes from empty space. From the sky itself, from nowhere and everywhere, a voice speaks, clear and distinct, praising them:

"'Well done! Well done! Good son! Good daughter! You who walk the Great Vehicle path, you who practice the Mahāyāna way!

"'You walk the Great Vehicle, and because of this merit, because of these causes and conditions you've created, you're able to see all these Buddhas. The vision has come to you because you earned it, because you practiced for it, because you opened yourself to it.

"'But even though you're seeing these World-Honored Ones now, even though your eyes have been purified to the point where you can see Buddhas on thrones throughout the cosmos—you still can't see Śākyamuni Buddha's manifestation-bodies, all them transformation-Buddhas he sends out to teach in different worlds. And you still can't see the tower of Many Treasures Buddha, that ancient stupa that rises up when the Lotus Sutra is preached, that testament to truth that appeared when Śākyamuni taught on Vulture Peak.

"'There's more to see. The vision can go deeper. Your purification can go further. Keep practicing. Don't stop now.'


THE VOW TO SEE ŚĀKYAMUNI AND MANY TREASURES

"When they hear this voice from empty space, when they receive this teaching from the invisible teacher, they practice reciting the Great Vehicle scriptures even harder, even more intensely. They don't slack off. They don't get discouraged. They hear there's more to see and they want to see it, they need to see it, they won't rest till they see it.

"And because they're reciting these Mahāyāna equal-teaching scriptures, because they're pouring their whole heart into the practice—in their dreams one night, while they sleeping, they see Śākyamuni Buddha with the great assembly at Vulture Peak Mountain.

"There he is, the World-Honored One, the sage of the Śākya clan, the teacher of this world, sitting on the mountain where he taught the greatest teachings, surrounded by thousands of disciples—monks and nuns, bodhisattvas and arhats, gods and dragons and humans all gathered to hear the Dharma.

"And he's preaching the Lotus Sutra, the Wonderful Dharma-Flower Scripture, the king of all sutras. He's explaining the teaching of One True Reality—the truth that all the different paths lead to the same place, that all the various vehicles are really one vehicle, that separation is illusion and unity is truth.

"The teaching tells them—tells the practitioner dreaming this dream—to confess. The Dharma says: repent your faults, acknowledge your failings, come clean about your wrongs.

"So they're thirsting to see more clearly. They're longing to see fully. They're yearning to see completely. They put their palms together, they get on their knees, they face toward Vulture Peak Mountain even though they far away, even though they dreaming, even though they ain't there in body. And they say with all their heart:

"'The Tathāgata, the Hero of the World, the Conqueror of Suffering, always remains in the world. Even though you seem to have passed into nirvāṇa, you're still here. Even though you appear to be gone, you're still present. Have mercy on me. Take pity on this suffering being. Show me your body. Let me see you clear.'

"When they speak like this, when they make this sincere prayer, when they call out from the heart—they see Vulture Peak Mountain transformed, adorned, beautified. They see it decorated with seven kinds of treasures—gold and silver, lapis and crystal, ruby and pearl and agate. The mountain that was ordinary is now extraordinary. The mountain that was plain is now precious.

"Countless monks are there, the声聞 (shēngwén) assembly, the śrāvaka-disciples, the hearers of the teaching, the arhats who've achieved liberation. Treasure-trees standing in neat rows like soldiers at attention, like a congregation assembled for worship. The jeweled ground level and perfect, smooth and pure.

"Wonderful jeweled lion-thrones are spread out everywhere, placed throughout the assembly, ready for the Buddhas and bodhisattvas to sit and teach.

"Śākyamuni Buddha sends out light from between his eyebrows—that white-tuft light, that úrṇā-light, that mark of the supreme person. This light spreads throughout the ten directions like dawn spreading across the sky, like the sun rising over the world.

"And it keeps going. It doesn't stop at the edges of this world-system. It goes past the ten directions, beyond the boundaries of this cosmos, into countless worlds beyond measure, beyond number, beyond imagination.

"Wherever this light reaches, wherever this radiance touches—the manifestation-body Śākyamuni Buddhas from all ten directions all gather at once. They come together like clouds gathering before a rain, like birds coming home to roost, like family coming together for a reunion.

"It's all described in the Wonderful Dharma Lotus Flower Sutra—you can read it there for the full details, for all the specifics, for the complete picture.


THE GATHERING OF INFINITE BUDDHAS

"Every manifestation-body Buddha—every one of these transformation-Buddhas that Śākyamuni has sent out throughout the cosmos to teach in different worlds—has a body the color of purple-gold. Beautiful beyond measure, radiant beyond description. Their size is immeasurable, can't be calculated, can't be counted. They sit on lion-thrones, thrones of authority, seats of teaching.

"Ten billion Buddhas. Countless great bodhisattvas serving as their assembly, their congregation, their sangha. Every bodhisattva's practice is the same as Universal Worthy's—they all walking the same path, following the same vows, manifesting the same compassion.

"Like this throughout the ten directions. It ain't just in one direction or two. In every direction, the same scene: countless Buddhas with countless bodhisattva assemblies gathered around them. All the same. All teaching. All saving. All blessing.

"When the great assembly is fully gathered, when all the Buddhas have arrived, when the congregation is complete—the practitioner sees Śākyamuni Buddha, the original, the source, the teacher who started it all. From every pore of his entire body, golden light shoots out. Rays and rays and rays of golden light, countless beams, infinite radiance.

"From every single ray of light, ten billion transformation-Buddhas appear. Each ray of light becomes ten billion Buddhas. Each Buddha teaching, each Buddha saving, each Buddha manifesting compassion.

"And all the manifestation-body Buddhas, all them transformation-Buddhas gathered from throughout the cosmos—they're sending out the white-tuft light from between their eyebrows too. The great mark of the supreme person, the úrṇā-light, the sign of enlightenment.

"This light from all the manifestation-Buddhas flows together like rivers flowing to the ocean, and it all enters into the crown of Śākyamuni Buddha's head. Flows in from ten directions and centers in the one Buddha, showing that the many and the one are not different, that diversity and unity are the same truth.

"When they see this—when the practitioner witnesses this cosmic gathering, this universal teaching—all the manifestation-body Buddhas, from every pore of all their bodies, send out golden light. Countless pores, countless rays, countless Buddhas in each ray.

"In every ray of light, transformation-Buddhas appear—numerous as the sands of the Ganges River, numerous as the grains of sand on all the beaches of all the rivers in India, multiplied by the number of atoms in the universe. More Buddhas than there are numbers to count them. The cosmos filled to overflowing with enlightened ones, with awakened beings, with teachers of truth.


THE LIGHT THAT UNLOCKS PAST LIVES

"Then Universal Worthy Bodhisattva—who's been there all along, who's been guiding this whole process, who's been teaching and helping and blessing—he sends out the great white-tuft light from between his own eyebrows. This light shoots forth and it enters the practitioner's mind. Goes right into their heart-mind, their consciousness, their deepest awareness.

"When this light enters their heart, when it penetrates their mind, when it illuminates their consciousness—suddenly, like lightning striking, like a dam breaking, like curtains being pulled back from a window—the practitioner remembers their past lives.

"They recall countless hundreds of thousands of previous existences. Life after life after life flashing before their inner eye. They see themselves in former bodies, in different times, in other places.

"And what they see is this: In life after life, they were studying the Dharma. In existence after existence, they were practicing the teaching. At the feet of innumerable Buddhas, countless World-Honored Ones, they received and upheld and read and recited Great Vehicle scriptures.

"This wasn't their first time hearing this teaching. This wasn't their first time practicing this path. They've been doing this for lifetimes, for eons, for immeasurable ages. The practice they doing now is the continuation of practice they been doing forever.

"They see their former bodies clear and distinct, detailed and vivid, just like someone with the abhijñā of remembering past lives, just like someone with the supernatural power of past-life recall. No different at all from the mystic power the Buddha talks about. They remember clearly, see plainly, know certainly.

"Suddenly they wake up big-time. The realization hits them like a wave, like a flood, like the ocean pouring into a teacup. They understand deep. They see clear. They know true.

"And they receive the 'revolving dhāraṇī'—the旋陀羅尼 (xuán tuóluóní)—the turning-and-holding spell that spins like a wheel and gathers everything in, that retains all teachings and forgets nothing.

"They receive hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of dhāraṇī-doors opening up inside their mind. Infinite memory-methods, countless retention-spells, boundless ways of holding the Dharma without letting it slip away.

"Coming out of this samādhi, emerging from this deep concentration, returning to ordinary consciousness but transformed by what they've seen—they now see face-to-face, with physical eyes wide open, all the manifestation-body Buddhas sitting on lion-seats under the treasure-trees.

"They also see the vaidūrya-ground, that lapis lazuli earth, pure and radiant. And coming up out of empty space from the lower direction, from beneath the earth, from the depths of the cosmos—there's clusters of lotus flowers rising up like fountains of light, like blossoms sprouting from the void, like beauty emerging from emptiness.

"Between every flower, in the spaces between the petals, there's bodhisattvas—numerous as atoms, countless as dust-motes, infinite as the particles that make up matter. All sitting cross-legged in meditation, all teaching the Dharma, all saving beings.

"They also see Universal Worthy's manifestation-body bodhisattvas multiplied throughout that crowd, repeated in the assembly, present everywhere. And all of them are praising the Great Vehicle, teaching the Mahāyāna, explaining the supreme path.


THE BODHISATTVAS TEACH THE SIX MINDFULNESSES

"All these bodhisattvas—thousands and thousands and thousands of them filling space—speak with different mouths but their voice is one voice, their message is one message, their teaching is one teaching. Perfect harmony. Perfect unity. Many instruments but one song.

"They teach the practitioner how to purify the six sense-organs. They explain the method. They show the way:

"Some of them say: 'You ought to be mindful of Buddha—think on the Awakened One, remember the Enlightened One, keep the Tathāgata in your heart always.'

"Some say: 'You ought to be mindful of Dharma—think on the teaching, remember the truth, keep the law of reality in your awareness.'

"Some say: 'You ought to be mindful of Sangha—think on the spiritual community, remember the assembly of practitioners, keep the fellowship of the path in your mind.'

"Some say: 'You ought to be mindful of precepts—think on moral conduct, remember ethical behavior, keep the guidelines for right living in your consciousness.'

"Some say: 'You ought to be mindful of giving—think on generosity, remember charity, keep the spirit of sharing in your heart.'

"Some say: 'You ought to be mindful of heaven—think on the celestial realms, remember the divine worlds, keep the possibility of higher birth in your awareness.'

"These six things—mindfulness of Buddha, Dharma, Sangha, precepts, giving, and heaven—these are the awakening-mind, the bodhicitta, the aspiration to enlightenment. These six mindfulnesses give birth to the bodhisattva-path. These practices produce the Great Vehicle way.

"Then they say, all together, speaking as one:

"'Now you should go before all the Buddhas and reveal your former sins. Confess with all sincerity. Come clean with complete honesty.


THE CONFESSION OF THE EYE-ROOT

"'Throughout countless ages, through numberless lifetimes, your eye-faculty—on account of causes and conditions, on account of karma, on account of ignorance—got greedy and attached to all kinds of forms and colors.

"'Because you attached to colors, you got greedy and lustful for all kinds of sense-objects and dusty phenomena. Your eyes saw something beautiful and you wanted it. Your eyes saw something attractive and you desired it. Your eyes saw something pleasant and you craved it.

"'Because you loved that dust, because you clung to those sense-objects, because you couldn't let go of what you saw—you received a woman's body in some lives. You were born female because of desire, because of lust, because of attachment to form.

"'Life after life, existence after existence, wherever you were born, whatever body you took—you got confused and attached to forms and colors. Pretty things caught your eye. Attractive things snared your attention. Beautiful things trapped your mind.

"'Colors ruined your eyes. Forms destroyed your vision. The things you saw made you a slave—a slave to affection, a slave to love, a slave to desire.

"'Color sent you traveling through the three realms—the desire realm, the form realm, the formless realm. This lowdown servant called "visual attraction," this cruel master called "attachment to form," made you blind to truth, made you unable to see reality, made you ignorant of the way things really are.

"'Now you're reciting the Great Vehicle equal-teaching scriptures. Now you're studying the Mahāyāna texts. These scriptures say clearly: the physical bodies of Buddhas in the ten directions don't perish, don't disappear, don't cease to exist. The Dharma-body is eternal. The Buddha is always present.

"'You now get to see them—is it really true or not? You seeing what the scriptures promise? You witnessing what the teachings describe?

"'Your eye-faculty's unwholesomeness has hurt you plenty over countless lives. It's caused you suffering. It's led you astray. It's kept you in bondage.

"'Follow our words now. Listen to this teaching. Turn toward all the Buddhas. Face the enlightened ones.

"'Śākyamuni Buddha teaches you: Speak out loud about all the faults and offenses your eye-faculty committed. Confess the sins of seeing. Repent the wrongs of vision.

"'May the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas with their wisdom-bright Dharma-water wash away your eye-sins, cleanse your vision, make your seeing pure.'

"After they say this, after they speak these words, you should prostrate your whole body and bow to all the Buddhas in the ten directions. Bow to the North and South, East and West, the corners and up and down. Bow to every Buddha everywhere.

"Face toward Śākyamuni Buddha. Face toward the Great Vehicle scriptures themselves, treating the texts as the Buddha's body. And you should say like this:

"'I now confess the heavy sins of my eye-faculty. All the obstacles, all the defilements, all the pollution that makes my eyes dark and turbid and dirty. Blind I've been, unable to see truth, unable to perceive reality.

"'May the Buddha in his great compassion, in his great kindness, take pity on me, protect me, cover me with his blessing.

"'Universal Worthy Bodhisattva rides the great Dharma-ship, ferrying all beings across the ocean of suffering. The ten directions are filled with countless bodhisattva-companions, all helping with the rescue.

"'Please, in your compassion, in your mercy, listen to my confession. Hear my repentance. Accept my turning-around.

"'The eye-faculty's unwholesomeness, all its evil karma, all the obstacles it created to the Dharma—I confess this now.'

"Say this three times. Repeat it three times with full sincerity.

"Then prostrate your whole body—all five points touching the ground—and keep your mind on the Great Vehicle. Don't forget the Mahāyāna. Don't let your mind wander. Don't lose the teaching.

"This is what we call the method for confessing the sins of the eye-faculty.

"Then you should call out the names of all the Buddhas. Burn incense and scatter flowers as offerings. Raise up the Great Vehicle intention in your heart. Hang silk banners and canopies. Speak about the faults and sufferings caused by the eye. Confess the sins of seeing.

"The person who confesses the eye-sins like this—in this present life, right now, they will see Śākyamuni Buddha and they will see the countless manifestation-body Buddhas throughout the cosmos.

"For asaṃkhyeya kalpas—for uncountable eons, for immeasurable ages—they won't fall into the evil destinies, won't be born in the hells or as hungry ghosts or as animals.

"Because of Great Vehicle power, because of Great Vehicle vows, because of the Mahāyāna aspiration—they will constantly be together with dhāraṇī-bodhisattvas as companions, as friends, as spiritual family.

"To think like this is called right-mindfulness, correct thinking. To think any other way is called wrong-mindfulness, incorrect thinking.

"This is what we call the initial境界 of the eye-faculty, the first stage of purifying the organ of sight.


THE CONFESSION TO SEE MANY TREASURES BUDDHA'S STUPA

"After you've purified your eye-faculty like this, you should recite and read the Great Vehicle scriptures even more. Six times every day and night—dawn, morning, noon, afternoon, evening, midnight—you should kneel down and confess, saying:

"'How come I only see Śākyamuni Buddha and his manifestation-body Buddhas? Why can't I see the tower of Many Treasures Buddha, that stupa containing the complete body-relics, those sacred remains?

"'The tower of Many Treasures Buddha exists eternally, never perishing, always present. But my eyes are turbid and evil, polluted and defiled. That's why I can't see it.'

"After you say this, confess again. Repent again. Go deeper into the practice.

"After seven days of this intensive practice, the tower of Many Treasures Buddha rises up from the earth, emerging like it did on Vulture Peak when Śākyamuni preached the Lotus Sutra.

"Śākyamuni Buddha reaches out with his right hand and opens the door of that tower, unlocking it, revealing what's inside.

"You see Many Treasures Buddha sitting inside in the samādhi called 'Universal Manifestation of Form-Bodies'—普現色身三昧 (pǔ xiàn sè shēn sānmèi). From every pore of his body, from every opening in his skin, there flows out light-rays numerous as the sands of the Ganges River multiplied by the atoms in the universe.

"In every ray of light, there's hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of transformation-Buddhas. All teaching. All saving. All blessing.

"When this vision appears, when this sight manifests, you—the practitioner—you filled with joy beyond measure. You happy like you never been happy. You praise Many Treasures Buddha with verses and poems. You walk around the tower in respect—circumambulate it clockwise seven complete circles, showing reverence the traditional way.

"After you finish walking around the stupa seven times, Many Treasures Tathāgata speaks. From inside the tower, a great voice comes forth, loud and clear and unmistakable, saying:

"'Dharma-son! Dharma-daughter! You are truly, genuinely, really practicing the Great Vehicle. You're following Universal Worthy's practice. You confessed and purified your eye-faculty according to the method.

"'Because of these causes and conditions, because of this merit and virtue, I have come to where you are. I have appeared before you. I am here to serve as your witness, to testify to your practice, to confirm your attainment.'

"Then Many Treasures Buddha praises you, saying:

"'Well done! Well done! Śākyamuni Buddha is able to preach the Great Dharma, to rain down the great Dharma-rain, to teach and transform turbid evil beings like us, to bring the polluted and confused to purity and awakening.'

"When you see Many Treasures Buddha's tower like this, when you receive this confirmation and blessing, you should go to Universal Worthy Bodhisattva. Approach him with respect. Put your palms together. Bow. And say:

"'Great teacher, please teach me to repent my faults, to confess my wrongs, to turn away from evil.'


THE CONFESSION OF THE EAR-ROOT

"Universal Worthy replies, saying to you:

"'Throughout many kalpas, through countless ages, your ear-faculty—on account of causes and conditions, on account of karma—followed after external sounds, chased after noises, got caught by what it heard.

"'When you heard fine music, when you heard beautiful sounds, your mind got confused and attached. You wanted to hear more. You craved the pleasant sounds. You couldn't let go of the lovely music.

"'When you heard ugly sounds, when you heard harsh noises, when you heard criticism or insults or bad news—you gave rise to eight hundred kinds of afflictive passion-thieves that harm you, that rob you of peace, that steal your clarity.

"'This evil ear of yours, this unwholesome faculty of hearing, led to evil results, evil consequences. You constantly heard evil sounds, unwholesome speech. You gave birth to all kinds of mental grabbing and grasping, all kinds of attachments and aversions.

"'Because you listened in an upside-down, perverted, confused way, because your hearing was twisted and wrong—you're headed for the evil destinies. You're gonna be born in border lands where the Dharma ain't taught, in barbarian countries where the teaching ain't heard, among people with wrong views who don't know truth from lies, in places where you won't hear the Dharma no matter how much you want to.

"'But now, today, you recited and upheld the Great Vehicle scriptures, this ocean of merit and virtue, this treasure-house of the Mahāyāna. Because of these causes and conditions, because of this practice, you got to see the Buddhas in all ten directions. Many Treasures Buddha's tower appeared to serve as your witness, to testify on your behalf.

"'Now you should speak out your own faults. You should confess your sins. You should repent all your wrongdoing.'

"When you hear Universal Worthy say this, you should put your palms together again, prostrate your whole body with all five points on the ground, and say:

"'Perfectly Enlightened World-Honored One, you appear now to serve as my witness, to testify for me. The equal-teaching scriptures, the Mahāyāna texts—these are my compassionate protector, my merciful refuge.

"'Please, I beg you, look at me. Listen to what I'm saying. Hear my confession.

"'From many kalpas ago all the way to this present life, my ear-faculty—on account of causes and conditions, on account of karma—heard sounds and got confused and attached. Like glue sticking to grass, like tar sticking to feathers, I couldn't get free. I was stuck.

"'When I heard all kinds of evil sounds, all kinds of unwholesome speech, I gave rise to the poison of affliction, the toxin of passion.

"'Place after place, I got confused and attached. There wasn't a moment's pause, wasn't a second's rest. I was constantly chasing after sounds, constantly caught by what I heard.

"'Because I sat in this cave called "ear," listening through these holes in my head, unwholesome sounds exhausted my spirit and consciousness, wore out my mind and awareness, made me tired and confused.

"'This caused me to fall into the three evil paths—hell, hungry ghost realm, animal realm. I fell down into suffering.

"'Now I'm just beginning to wake up, just starting to understand. I come before all the World-Honored Ones to confess openly, to reveal what I've done, to repent sincerely.'

"After you confess like this, after you speak from the heart, you see Many Treasures Buddha sending out great light. This light is golden in color, radiant and pure. It shines throughout the Eastern direction and spreads to all ten directions, illuminating countless worlds.

"In the Eastern sky, a voice calls out, announcing:

"'These Buddhas, these World-Honored Ones, are all named Śubha-vyūha—Excellent Array, Fine Adornment, Beautiful Arrangement. They also have countless manifestation-body Buddhas. They sit under jeweled trees on lion-thrones in full lotus posture. All these World-Honored Ones have entered the samādhi called Universal Manifestation of Form-Bodies.'

"All these Buddhas together praise you, saying:

"'Well done! Well done! Good son! Good daughter! You are now reading and reciting the Great Vehicle scriptures. What you're reciting is the境界 of Buddhas, the sphere of enlightened ones, the realm of the awakened.

"Then Universal Worthy Bodhisattva teaches you the method for further repentance, saying:


THE CONFESSION OF THE NOSE-ROOT

"'In former lives, in previous existences, throughout countless kalpas, you—on account of greed for fragrances, on account of desire for pleasant smells—discriminated among all kinds of consciousnesses, divided experience into pleasant and unpleasant, got caught in judgments about smells.

"'Place after place, you got greedy and attached. You smelled something good and you wanted more. You smelled something bad and you pushed it away. This caused you to fall into saṃsāra, into the round of birth and death, into the cycle of suffering.

"'Now you should contemplate the cause of the Great Vehicle. What is the Great Vehicle cause? The true mark of all dharmas—諸法實相 (zhū fǎ shíxiàng)—the way things really are, reality as it actually is, suchness itself.'

"When you hear this teaching, you should prostrate your whole body with all five points on the ground and confess again.

"After you finish confessing, you should say:

"'Homage to Śākyamuni Buddha!
Homage to the tower of Many Treasures Buddha!
Homage to the manifestation-body Buddhas of Śākyamuni Buddha throughout the ten directions!
Homage to Śubha-vyūha Buddha in the Eastern direction and all his manifestation-body Buddhas!'

"After you say this, you should bow to all the Buddhas throughout the ten directions. With each Buddha that your eyes see, each enlightened one that your mind perceives, bow to them one by one in your heart, honoring each one, respecting each one.

"Make offerings of incense and flowers. After you finish making offerings, kneel down proper, put your palms together, and with all kinds of verses and poems, praise all the Buddhas.

"After you finish praising them, confess the ten evil karmas. Repent all your sins.

"After you confess, you should say:

"'In former lives, throughout countless kalpas past, I—on account of greed for fragrance, flavor, and touch, on account of desire for pleasant smells and tastes and sensations—created all kinds of evil, performed all kinds of unwholesome deeds.

"'Because of these causes and conditions, because of this karma, throughout countless existences I constantly received bodies in hell, in the hungry ghost realm, in the animal realm, in border lands, among people with wrong views—all kinds of unwholesome bodies, all kinds of suffering existences.

"'These evil karmas, these unwholesome deeds—today I reveal them openly. Today I confess them completely. I turn toward all the Buddhas, the righteous Dharma-kings, the true teachers of the way. I speak my sins. I repent my wrongs.'

"After you confess like this, your body and mind shouldn't slack off, shouldn't get lazy, shouldn't rest on what you've accomplished. You should recite and read the Great Vehicle scriptures even more diligently.

"Because of Great Vehicle power, because of Mahāyāna strength, a voice comes from empty space, saying:

"'Dharma-son! Dharma-daughter! Now you should go before the Buddhas in all ten directions and praise the Great Vehicle. In the presence of all the Buddhas, you should speak out your own faults.

"'The Buddhas, the Tathāgatas—they are your compassionate father, your kind parent, your loving protector. You should speak out about the unwholesome evil karma that your tongue-faculty created.


THE CONFESSION OF THE TONGUE-ROOT

"'This tongue-faculty of yours—it's an agent of evil karma, it stirs up unwholesome activity. It speaks false words—lies and deceit. It speaks flowery words—seductive and misleading speech. It speaks harsh words—cruel and cutting language. It speaks divisive words—gossip and slander that splits people apart.

"'It slanders the truth and speaks lies. It praises wrong views and evil opinions. It speaks useless words that don't benefit anyone, empty talk that wastes time and energy. All these various evil karmas, all these different unwholesome deeds—your tongue is responsible for them.

"'Your tongue creates conflict and division, breaks apart harmony, ruins relationships. It speaks about Dharma as if it's not Dharma. It speaks about non-Dharma as if it's Dharma. It confuses right and wrong, mixes up truth and lies.

"'All these many sins, all these accumulated wrongs—now you should confess them completely before all the World-Honored Ones, before all the Heroic Ones.'

"After you hear this, you should prostrate your whole body with all five points on the ground. Bow to all the Buddhas in the ten directions. Put your palms together. Kneel down proper. And you should say:

"'This tongue of mine has countless faults, immeasurable offenses. Evil karma-thorns sprout from this tongue-root, grow from this speech-organ.

"'The cutting-off of the Dharma-wheel, the destruction of true teaching—it starts from this tongue of mine. This evil tongue cuts the root of merit, destroys the seed of virtue.

"'In matters that ain't right, in wrong and harmful things, my tongue goes on and on, argues strongly, speaks forcefully, like adding wood to a fire, like feeding flames.

"'It praises wrong views and evil opinions, speaks well of what should be condemned. Like a blazing fire that burns everything, like a forest fire that destroys all, it injures living beings, harms all creatures.

"'Like someone who drinks poison even though they got no wound to treat, death comes without any external injury needed—my wrong speech poisons me from inside.

"'These sinful results, these evil unwholesome consequences, will make me fall into evil destinies for hundreds of kalpas, for thousands of kalpas.

"'Because of false speech, because of lies, I'll fall into the great hells, into Avīci, into the lowest pit of suffering.

"'Now I turn toward the Buddhas of the Southern direction. I confess my dark evil deeds. I reveal my hidden wrongs.'

"When you think like this, when you confess like this, a voice comes from empty space, saying:

"'In the Southern direction there is a Buddha named Candana-śrī—Sandalwood Excellence, Fragrant Virtue. This Buddha also has countless manifestation-bodies.

"'All these Buddhas teach the Great Vehicle, the Mahāyāna that removes and destroys sinful karma and evil deeds.

"'All these many sins, all these accumulated wrongs—now you should turn toward the Buddhas in all ten directions, the countless World-Honored Ones, the greatly compassionate teachers. Confess your dark evil. Reveal your hidden wrongs. Repent with sincere heart.'

"After you say this, after you speak these words, prostrate your whole body with all five points on the ground. Bow again to all the Buddhas.

"Then all these Buddhas send out light that shines on you, illuminates you, blesses you. This light makes your body and mind naturally joyful, spontaneously happy. You feel bliss without external cause.

"You give birth to great compassion, great lovingkindness. You think about all beings with mercy and care. Your heart opens up to include everyone and everything.


THE TEACHING ON GREAT COMPASSION, LOVINGKINDNESS, JOY, AND EQUANIMITY

"Then all these Buddhas extensively teach you—the practitioner—about the great compassion and the great lovingkindness, about sympathetic joy and equanimity. They also teach you about loving speech—how to talk to people like they matter, like they somebody, like they deserve respect. They teach you the Six Harmonies—how to live together without tearing each other apart:

"Harmony in sharing the same space—dwelling together in peace.
Harmony in following the same moral conduct—keeping the same precepts.
Harmony in holding the same views—thinking the same good thoughts without jealousy.
Harmony in speaking—using words that build instead of words that burn.
Harmony in sharing benefits—distributing what you got fair and square so nobody goes hungry while somebody else gets fat.
Harmony in experiencing the same joy—getting the same liberation together, not climbing over each other's backs.

"When you—the practitioner—hear this teaching, your heart swells up like a river after rain. Joy comes flooding through. You're so happy you can hardly stand it.

"You recite and study even more intensely. You practice even more diligently. You never slack off. You never let up. You never put it down.


THE TEACHING ON BODY-AND-MIND REPENTANCE

"Then from that empty sky, from the invisible teaching-voice, a subtle and wondrous sound comes forth, speaking these words:

"'Now you should confess both body and mind. Now you should repent physical and mental karma.

"'Your body did three kinds of wrong:
- Killing—taking life that wasn't yours to take
- Stealing—grabbing what don't belong in your hands
- Sexual misconduct—using people like they're things, breaking hearts and homes, violating what should be sacred

"'Your mind thought about all kinds of unwholesomeness, entertained all kinds of evil, gave rise to all kinds of wrong.

"'You created the ten evil karmas. You committed the five unforgivable sins—sins so heavy they got immediate results, so terrible they can't be pardoned by ordinary means.

"'Your mind is like a monkey that can't sit still, jumping from branch to branch, from thought to thought. Your mind is like sticky sap, like molasses, like glue—whatever it touches, it sticks to. You can't pull free.

"'Your mind grasps at everything. It goes to all the six sense-faculties, enters through all the six doors. It pervades everything, attaches to everything, grabs onto everything.

"'These six sense-faculties and the karma they create—they got roots and branches and flowers and leaves. They spread throughout the Three Realms, throughout the Twenty-Five Modes of Existence, throughout every place a being can be born.

"'This karma increases and nourishes ignorance, old age, and death. It makes the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination grow strong: ignorance conditions formations, formations condition consciousness, consciousness conditions name-and-form, name-and-form conditions the six sense-bases, the six sense-bases condition contact, contact conditions feeling, feeling conditions craving, craving conditions clinging, clinging conditions becoming, becoming conditions birth, birth conditions old age and death.

"'It produces the Eight Wrong Paths—wrong view, wrong thought, wrong speech, wrong action, wrong livelihood, wrong effort, wrong mindfulness, wrong concentration.

"'It generates the Eight Difficulties—being born in hell, being born as a hungry ghost, being born as an animal, being born in a remote border land, being born among the long-lived gods who don't hear the Dharma, being born with impaired faculties, being born with worldly intelligence that leads to wrong views, being born in the gap between Buddhas when there's no teaching.

"'You've experienced every one of these difficulties. You've been through all these sufferings.

"'Now you should confess these evil unwholesome deeds. Now you should repent these unwholesome karmas. Now you should turn around and walk the other direction.'


WHERE TO PRACTICE CONFESSION - THE PURE LAND OF VAIROCANA

"When you—the practitioner—hear this teaching-voice, when you receive these instructions, you ask the voice in the sky:

"'Where should I go to practice this confession method? What place is proper for this repentance?'

"The voice from empty space responds, saying:

"'Śākyamuni Buddha—his other name is Vairocana, the Illuminator, the Light-Bringer, the One Who Shines Everywhere. He pervades all places. He's present everywhere.

"'The place where this Buddha dwells is called "Constant Tranquil Light"—常寂光 (cháng jì guāng). This is the land where the Permanence-Perfection resides, where the Eternity-Pāramitā has created and established everything. This is the place where the Purity-Perfection has destroyed all marks of existence, where the Self-Perfection doesn't dwell in body-and-mind marks. This is where you don't see existence or non-existence, where all dharma-marks have been transcended.

"'Like the liberation of tranquility, like the extinction of suffering, all the way to the Prajñā-Pāramitā, the Perfection of Wisdom—this is form constantly abiding as Dharma, reality permanently established as truth.

"'You should contemplate the Buddhas of the ten directions like this.'

"Then the Buddhas in all ten directions each stretch out their right hand toward you. They touch the crown of your head, rubbing it, blessing it. And they say:

"'Well done! Well done! Good son! Good daughter! You recite and read the Great Vehicle scriptures, and because of this, the Buddhas in all ten directions teach you the confession method, teach you the practices of bodhisattvas.

"'Don't cut off the afflictions—煩惱 (fánnǎo). Don't try to eliminate the passions completely. Don't dwell in the ocean of afflictions either—don't set up house in suffering, don't make yourself at home in confusion.

"'Observe the mind, and see that mind is no-mind—there's no solid, permanent, independent thing called "mind." See that mind arises from inverted, upside-down thinking, from confused perception.

"'This thought-mind, this thinking-consciousness—it arises from false imagination, from fabrication, from construction. It's like wind in empty space—it moves but it's got no solid basis, no place to stand, no foundation to rest on.

"'Dharmas are like this—they don't arise and they don't cease. They're not born and they don't die. They appear but they ain't real. They manifest but they got no substance.

"'What is sin? What is merit? Look for them and you can't find them. My mind itself is empty—where would sin and merit reside? Sin and merit got no owner, no master, no boss.

"'All dharmas are like this—without dwelling-place, without something solid to grab onto, without anything that breaks or gets destroyed.

"'To confess like this—to contemplate the mind and see it's no-mind, to see that dharmas don't dwell in dharmas, to understand that all dharmas are liberated and extinct and tranquil—to think like this is called Great Repentance. This is called Adorned Repentance. This is called No-Sin-Mark Repentance. This is called Breaking and Destroying the Conceptual Mind.

"'The person who practices this kind of confession—their body and mind become pure and clean. They don't dwell in any dharma. They're like flowing water—never staying in one place, never getting stuck, never stagnant. Moving, moving, always moving.

"'Thought after thought, moment after moment念唸之中 (niàn niàn zhī zhōng)—they see Universal Worthy Bodhisattva and the Buddhas in all ten directions.

"'Then all these World-Honored Ones, with their great compassion light, with their merciful radiance, teach the practitioner about the signless dharma, about the truth beyond marks, about reality without characteristics—the first principle emptiness, the supreme truth.'

"When you—the practitioner—hear about this first-principle emptiness, when you receive this teaching about the supreme truth, your mind doesn't get scared. You don't panic. You don't freak out. You don't run away from the teaching even though it's profound and deep and goes against everything your ego wants to believe.

"Right then, at that very moment, you enter the Bodhisattva's Correct Position—菩薩正位 (púsà zhèng wèi). You enter the rank of bodhisattvas who won't turn back, who won't regress, who are definitely heading toward enlightenment.


THE BUDDHA'S TEACHING TO ĀNANDA - CONFESSION FOR ALL BEINGS

"The Buddha said to Ānanda:

"'This kind of practitioner, the person who practices like I just described—this is called someone who truly confesses, who genuinely repents.

"'This confession I just taught—this is the confession method of all the Buddhas in the ten directions and all the great bodhisattvas. This is how the enlightened ones repent. This is the awakened ones' method of purification.

"'Ānanda, after the Buddha passes away, after I enter final nirvāṇa, after I leave this world—the Buddha's disciples in future times, if they want to confess evil unwholesome karma, if they want to repent their sins—they should simply recite and read the Great Vehicle scriptures. That's the method. That's the way.

"'These equal-teaching scriptures, these Mahāyāna texts—they are the eye of all the Buddhas. Because of these scriptures, the Buddhas obtain the Five Eyes: the physical eye, the divine eye, the wisdom eye, the Dharma eye, and the Buddha eye.

"'The Buddha's Three Bodies—the Dharma-body, the Reward-body, and the Transformation-body—are all born from these equal-teaching scriptures. These texts are the mother of the Tathāgatas.

"'This is the Great Dharma-Seal, the stamp of truth, the mark of reality. This seal stamps the ocean of nirvāṇa, marks the sea of liberation.

"'Within this ocean, within this sea, three kinds of Buddha's pure and clean bodies are born:

"First, the Dharma-body—the truth-body, reality itself, the Buddha as the nature of things.

"Second, the Reward-body—the body of realization, the fruit of eons of practice, the Buddha as the result of merit.

"Third, the Transformation-body—the manifestation-body, the body that appears in the world to teach, the Buddha as the skillful means that saves beings.

"'These three kinds of bodies—they are the field of blessings for humans and gods, for all beings in all realms. They are the most supreme among all those worthy of offerings. They are the highest recipients of respect and support.

"'If someone recites and reads these Great Equal-Teaching scriptures, these Mahāyāna Vaipulya texts—you should know this: that person possesses the Buddha's merit and virtue. All their evils are permanently destroyed. They are born from the Buddha's wisdom. They come forth from enlightenment itself.'

"Then the World-Honored One spoke verses, spoke in poetry, spoke in a way that could be remembered and chanted:


VERSES ON THE SIX SENSE-FACULTIES

"If your eye-faculty done evil,
If karma-obstacles made your eyes unclean,
Just recite the Great Vehicle scriptures,
Think on the First Principle, the supreme meaning.
This is called confessing the eye,
Exhausting all unwholesome karma.

"The ear-faculty hears confused sounds,
Destroying harmony, ruining unity.
Because of this, craziness arises,
Like a monkey gone mad, like a fool jumping around.
Just recite the Great Vehicle scriptures,
Contemplate dharmas as empty, without marks.
Permanently exhaust all evil karma,
Obtain the heavenly ear that hears ten directions.

"The nose-faculty clings to all kinds of fragrances,
Following pollution, giving rise to contact and attachment.
This crazy, confused nose
Follows defilement, gives birth to dusty phenomena.
If you recite the Great Vehicle scriptures,
Contemplate dharmas as they truly are—as reality,
You'll permanently leave all evil karma,
Never be born into it again in future lives.

"The tongue-faculty creates five kinds
Of evil speech, unwholesome verbal karma.
If you want to tame and regulate yourself,
You should diligently cultivate the heart of compassion,
Think on Dharma's true tranquil meaning,
Without any discriminating marks.

"The mind-faculty is like a monkey,
Never stopping even for a moment.
If you want to subdue it,
You should diligently recite the Great Vehicle,
Think on Buddha's Great Awakened Body,
Accomplished through Powers and Fearlessnesses.

"The body is the master of the mechanism,
Like dust following the wind's turning.
The six thieves play in it,
Free and easy, without any obstruction.
If you want to destroy this evil,
Permanently leave all dusty defilements,
Constantly dwell in the city of nirvāṇa,
Your mind peaceful and happy and tranquil,
You should recite the Great Vehicle scriptures,
Think on the mother of all bodhisattvas—
The countless supreme skillful means
All come from thinking on True Reality.

"These six dharmas I just explained
Are called the six sense-faculties.
All the oceans of karmic obstacles,
All are born from false thinking.
If you want to confess,
Sit upright and think on True Reality.
All sins are like frost and dew—
The sun of wisdom can melt them away.
Therefore you should wholeheartedly
Confess the six sense-faculties.


THE BUDDHA INSTRUCTS ĀNANDA TO SPREAD THE TEACHING

"After the Buddha spoke these verses, he said to Ānanda:

"'Ānanda, you should uphold this confession method for the six sense-faculties, this contemplation of Universal Worthy Bodhisattva. Universally, for the sake of gods and humans in the ten directions, for the sake of all beings everywhere, you should extensively explain it, spread it widely, teach it thoroughly.

"'After the Buddha passes into extinction, after I'm gone from this world, if the Buddha's disciples want to receive and uphold and read and recite and explain the Equal-Teaching scriptures, the Mahāyāna texts, they should practice in a quiet place.

"'Maybe in a charnel ground among the tombs, maybe under forest trees, maybe in an araṇya-place, a wilderness hermitage, far from the noise and bustle of town—they should recite the Equal-Teaching scriptures there, read the Mahāyāna texts there, think on the Great Vehicle's meaning there, contemplate the profound truth there.

"'Because the power of their mindfulness is strong, because their concentration is focused, they will see my body—they'll see Śākyamuni Buddha. They'll see the tower of Many Treasures Buddha. They'll see the manifestation-body Buddhas throughout the ten directions, countless enlightened ones. They'll see Universal Worthy Bodhisattva, Mañjuśrī Bodhisattva, Medicine King Bodhisattva, Medicine Superior Bodhisattva.

"'Because they respect the Dharma, because they honor the teaching, all these bodhisattvas will hold wonderful flowers and stand in empty space, in the sky above the practitioner, praising them, honoring them, respecting them, supporting the person who upholds the Dharma.

"'Just by reciting the Great Vehicle Equal-Teaching scriptures, just by reading the Mahāyāna texts—the Buddhas and Bodhisattvas will day and night make offerings to this person who upholds the Dharma. Day and night they'll protect them, support them, bless them.

"'Ānanda, I and all the bodhisattvas of this Bhadra-kalpa—this Fortunate Eon when a thousand Buddhas appear—and the Buddhas throughout the ten directions, all of us, because we contemplated the Great Vehicle's true and real meaning, because we thought on the profound Mahāyāna truth, we eliminated hundreds of millions of billions of koṭis of asaṃkhyeya kalpas' worth of birth-and-death sins. Uncountable eons of suffering, we wiped them away.

"'Because of this supreme and wonderful confession method, because of this excellent repentance practice, now we've each become Buddhas in the ten directions. Now we're enlightened. Now we're awakened. Now we're free.

"'If someone wants to quickly accomplish Anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi—the Supreme, Perfect, Complete Enlightenment—if someone wants to see the Buddhas in the ten directions and Universal Worthy Bodhisattva right now in this present body—they should take a pure bath, cleansing their body, and put on clean clothes.

"'They should burn all kinds of fine incense, making offerings. In an empty, quiet place, away from distraction, they should recite and read the Great Vehicle scriptures, contemplate and think on the Great Vehicle's meaning.

"'Ānanda, if there are living beings who want to contemplate Universal Worthy Bodhisattva, who want to see him clearly—they should practice this contemplation like I just taught. To contemplate like this is called correct contemplation. Any other way of contemplating is called wrong contemplation, mistaken practice.

"'After the Buddha passes into extinction, if the Buddha's disciples follow the Buddha's words and practice this confession method, you should know: these people are practicing the practices of Universal Worthy. They're walking the bodhisattva path.

"'People who practice Universal Worthy's practices won't see evil marks, won't see signs of wickedness, won't see the results of evil karma. Evil won't come to them. Suffering won't find them.

"'If living beings practice like this—six times every day and night they bow to the Buddhas in the ten directions, recite the Great Vehicle scriptures, think on the First Principle, the supreme meaning, contemplate the extremely deep emptiness-dharma—just in the snap of a finger, just in one moment—they eliminate hundreds of millions of billions of koṭis of asaṃkhyeya kalpas of birth-and-death sin. Uncountable eons of suffering, gone in an instant.

"'People who practice this practice—they are truly children of the Buddha. They're born from all the Buddhas. The Buddhas in the ten directions and all the bodhisattvas serve as their preceptor, their teacher, their guide.

"'This is what we call someone who has completely fulfilled the bodhisattva precepts. They don't need a formal ordination ceremony. They don't need the kaṛma-procedure. This naturally accomplishes everything. They just成就 (chéngjiù)—it's just完成 (wánchéng)—they just complete it naturally.

"'They should receive offerings from all humans and gods, from all beings in all realms. They're worthy of support. They're worthy of respect. They're worthy of everything that's offered to a Buddha.


HOW TO TAKE THE BODHISATTVA PRECEPTS

"Now, if someone practicing like this wants to fully receive the bodhisattva precepts, wants to formally take the vows, they should put their palms together and go to an empty, quiet place, a place of solitude.

"They should bow to the Buddhas throughout the ten directions, confessing all their sins, speaking out all their faults. After confessing like this, after repenting like this, they should sit quietly in that secluded place and address the Buddhas in all ten directions like this:

"'All you Buddhas, all you World-Honored Ones, you constantly abide in the world. You're always present. But because of my karmic obstacles, because of my sins, even though I believe in the Equal-Teaching scriptures, even though I trust the Mahāyāna texts, when I see Buddhas I don't see them clearly. My vision is unclear. My sight is incomplete.

"'Now I take refuge in Buddha. I go for refuge to the Awakened One.

"'I pray: May Śākyamuni Buddha, the Perfectly Enlightened World-Honored One, serve as my preceptor, my teacher, my ordination master.

"'May Mañjuśrī, the one possessed of great wisdom, the bodhisattva of vast understanding—may he with his wisdom bestow upon me the pure Dharma of all bodhisattvas, teach me the clean practices, transmit to me the undefiled way.

"'May Maitreya Bodhisattva, the victorious sun of great compassion, the one whose kindness is supreme—please take pity on me, please have mercy on me, please listen as I receive the bodhisattva Dharma, as I take these vows.

"'May the Buddhas in the ten directions now serve as my witnesses, as my testimony, as my confirmation.

"'May all the great bodhisattvas, each called by their names, each invoked individually—these supreme great beings who protect living beings, who help and support all beings—please assist and protect me as I today receive and uphold the Equal-Teaching scriptures, the Mahāyāna texts.

"'Even if I lose my life, even if I fall into hell and receive immeasurable suffering, I will never slander the correct Dharma of all the Buddhas. I will never speak against the true teaching. I will never turn away from the Mahāyāna.

"'Because of these causes and conditions, because of this merit and virtue, may Śākyamuni Buddha now serve as my preceptor.

"'May Mañjuśrī serve as my ācārya, my teaching-master, my instructor in the Dharma.

"'May the coming Maitreya bestow the Dharma upon me, transmit the teaching to me, authorize my practice.

"'May the Buddhas in the ten directions bear witness to me, testify for me, confirm my vows.

"'May the great virtuous bodhisattvas be my companions, my friends, my spiritual family on the path.

"'Today, relying on the Great Vehicle scriptures' extremely deep and wonderful meaning, relying on the profound truth of the Mahāyāna, I take refuge in Buddha, I take refuge in Dharma, I take refuge in Sangha.'

"Say this three times. Repeat this three-refuge formula three times with complete sincerity.

"After you've taken refuge in the Three Jewels like this, next you should make vows to receive the Six Major Precepts—the six重法 (zhòng fǎ), the six weighty dharmas, the six essential rules.

"After you've received the Six Major Precepts, next you should diligently cultivate the unobstructed pure conduct—梵行 (fànxíng). Raise up the vast mind to save all beings universally. Receive the Eight Major Precepts—the eight重法, the eight weighty dharmas, the eight serious vows.

"After you've established these vows, in that empty, quiet place, burn all kinds of fine incense, scatter flowers as offerings. Make offerings to all the Buddhas and all the bodhisattvas and the Great Vehicle Equal-Teaching scriptures. And say:

"'Today I raise up the bodhicitta, the awakening-mind, the aspiration to enlightenment. With this merit, with this virtue, I vow to universally ferry across all living beings, to save everyone, to exclude no one, to leave nobody behind.'

"After you say this, you should bow again, prostrating fully to all the Buddhas and all the bodhisattvas. Think on the meaning of the Equal-Teaching scriptures, contemplate the truth of the Mahāyāna.

"Do this for one day, or all the way up to three seven-day periods—twenty-one days total.

"Whether you're a home-leaver who's left the household life or a home-dweller who's still living in the world, you don't need a preceptor for this. You don't need various teachers. You don't need to request the kaṛma-procedure, the formal ordination ceremony.

"Just by the power of receiving and upholding and reading and reciting the Great Vehicle scriptures, just by Universal Worthy Bodhisattva's encouragement and inspiration, just by this practice—this is the true Dharma-eye of all the Buddhas in the ten directions, the real vision of all the enlightened ones.

"Because of this Dharma, you naturally accomplish the Five-Part Dharma-Body:

Morality—戒 (jiè)
Concentration—定 (dìng)
Wisdom—慧 (huì)
Liberation—解脫 (jiětuō)
Knowledge-and-Vision of Liberation—解脫知見 (jiětuō zhījiàn)

"All the Tathāgatas, all the Buddhas, are born from this Dharma. From the Great Vehicle scriptures, they receive the prediction of future Buddhahood, the授記 (shòujì), the prophecy of enlightenment.

"Therefore, wise people should know this:


CONFESSION FOR MONASTICS WHO'VE BROKEN PRECEPTS

"If people in the śrāvaka-vehicle—if monks or nuns or trainees—have destroyed and broken the Three Refuges, have violated the Five Precepts, have transgressed the Eight Precepts, have corrupted the Bhikṣu Precepts, have defiled the Bhikṣuṇī Precepts, have broken the Śrāmaṇera Precepts, have violated the Śrāmaṇerikā Precepts, have transgressed the Śikṣamāṇā Precepts, have failed to observe the various rules of deportment and conduct—

"If because of stupidity and ignorance, because of unwholesomeness and evil intention, because of wrong and perverted mind, they've committed many violations of the precepts and rules of conduct—

"If they want to eliminate these transgressions, if they want to wipe away these offenses, if they want to make them without fault or stain—

"If they want to return to being a bhikṣu, to recover the marks and characteristics of a真正 (zhēnzhèng) śramaṇa, a true renunciant, a genuine monastic—

"They should diligently recite and read the Equal-Teaching scriptures, the Mahāyāna texts. They should think on the First Principle, the supreme meaning, contemplate the extremely deep emptiness-dharma.

"They should make this emptiness-wisdom correspond with their mind, make this空慧 (kōng huì) match up with their awareness.

"You should know: for this kind of person, in thought after thought念唸之頃 (niàn niàn zhī qǐng), in moment after moment, all their sin and defilement are permanently exhausted, completely eliminated, totally gone without any remainder.

"This is called someone who fully possesses the śramaṇa-dharma, the way of the renunciant. This is called someone who possesses all the rules of deportment and威儀 (wēiyí), all the proper conduct.

"They should receive offerings from all humans and gods, from all beings in all realms.


CONFESSION FOR LAYPEOPLE

"If an upāsaka—a male lay Buddhist practitioner—violates the various rules of deportment, does unwholesome things, commits evil deeds—what are these unwholesome things? They are:

Speaking about the faults of the Buddha-Dharma, criticizing the teaching
Discussing and revealing the evil things that the four assemblies (monks, nuns, laymen, laywomen) have done
Stealing—taking what's not given
Sexual misconduct—violating sexual ethics
Being without shame and conscience

"If they want to confess these wrongs, if they want to repent these sins, if they want to destroy and eliminate these karmas, they should diligently read and recite the Equal-Teaching scriptures, the Mahāyāna texts. They should think on the First Principle, the supreme meaning.


CONFESSION FOR RULERS AND THE POWERFUL

"If a king, if a great minister, if a Brahmin, if a householder, if an elder, if a government official—if these kinds of people are greedy and求 (qiú) without satisfaction, always wanting more and never content—

"If they've committed the Five Unforgivable Sins:
Killing one's mother
Killing one's father
Killing an arhat
Causing a Buddha's body to bleed
Creating a schism in the Sangha

"If they've slandered the Equal-Teaching scriptures, spoken against the Mahāyāna texts, rejected the Great Vehicle—

"If they've perfected the Ten Evil Karmas, if they've accomplished all ten unwholesome deeds—

"This great evil retribution, this terrible karmic result, is more certain than a violent rainstorm. They will definitely, without question, fall into Avīci Hell, into the lowest pit, into uninterrupted suffering.

"If they want to eliminate this karmic obstacle, if they want to remove this barrier, they should give birth to shame and conscience, they should reform and repent all their sins.

"What is the confession method for a kṣatriya ruler or a householder? What is their repentance practice?

THE FIVE CONFESSIONS FOR RULERS

"The confession method is this:

FIRST CONFESSION: Correct the Mind Toward the Sacred

"They should simply make their mind correct and upright. They shouldn't slander the Three Jewels—shouldn't speak against Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha.

"They shouldn't obstruct people from leaving home, shouldn't prevent people from becoming monastics.

"They shouldn't create evil difficulties and troubles for people practicing pure conduct, for people living the梵行 (fànxíng).

"They should tie their thoughts to practicing the Six Mindfulnesses六唸法 (liù niàn fǎ):

Mindfulness of Buddha
Mindfulness of Dharma
Mindfulness of Sangha
Mindfulness of Morality
Mindfulness of Giving
Mindfulness of Heaven

"They should also give support and供給 (gōngjǐ) to those who uphold the Great Vehicle, providing what they need, helping their practice.

"They don't necessarily have to bow down and prostrate to these practitioners, but they should support them, respect them, make their way easier.

"They should constantly remember and contemplate the extremely deep scriptures, the profound經法 (jīngfǎ), the First Principle義 (yì), the supreme emptiness空 (kōng).

"To think on this Dharma—this is called the First Confession for kṣatriyas and householders, the first repentance for rulers and laypeople.

SECOND CONFESSION: Honor Your Roots

"The second confession method is this: They should practice filial piety toward父母 (fùmǔ) their mother and father, taking care of their parents. They should be respectful and reverent toward師長 (shīzhǎng) their teachers and elders.

"This is called cultivating the Second Confession.

THIRD CONFESSION: Rule with Justice

"The third confession method is this: They should use correct Dharma to govern the country治國 (zhìguó), to rule the land. They shouldn't act crookedly or unjustly toward the people民 (mín), shouldn't oppress the citizens unfairly.

"This is called cultivating the Third Confession.

FOURTH CONFESSION: Preserve Life

"The fourth confession method is this: On the six齋日 (zhāi rì) fast-days each month, they should issue orders throughout their境內 (jìng nèi) territory, throughout all the regions where their power力所及處 (lì suǒ jí chù) reaches—they should command that不殺 (bù shā) no killing be practiced, that life be preserved, that living beings be protected.

"To cultivate like this, to practice like this—this is called cultivating the Fourth Confession.

FIFTH CONFESSION: Trust Cause and Effect

"The fifth confession method is this: They should deeply believe in因果 (yīnguǒ) cause and effect, trust in karma. They should have faith in一實道 (yī shí dào) the One True Path, the single reality. They should know that佛不滅 (fó bù miè) the Buddha is not extinct, that the Awakened One hasn't truly disappeared, that the Enlightened One is still present.

"This is called cultivating the Fifth Confession.


THE BUDDHA'S PROMISE TO THOSE WHO PRACTICE

"The Buddha said to Ānanda:

"'In the future world, in the ages to come, if there are living beings who cultivate and practice this confession method like I just taught—you should know about these people, you should understand this:

"'These people have put on the garment of shame and conscience慚愧服 (cánkuì fú). They're wearing humility and remorse like clothing, like armor, like protection.

"'All the Buddhas protect and assist them護助 (hù zhù), help them and support them.

"'It won't be long不久 (bù jiǔ)—you hear me clearly—it won't be long before they accomplish成 (chéng) Anuttara-samyak-saṃbodhi, the Supreme, Perfect, Complete Enlightenment, the highest awakening, the ultimate realization.'


THE GREAT RESPONSE - HEAVEN REJOICES

"When the Buddha spoke these words, when the Blessed One finished this teaching—ten thousand天子 (tiānzǐ) divine princes, ten thousand heavenly beings, got the Dharma-eye pure得法眼淨 (dé fǎ yǎn jìng). Their vision of truth became clear, their understanding of reality became clean, their perception of the way became purified.

"Maitreya Bodhisattva and all the other great bodhisattvas, and Ānanda—all of them heard what the Buddha had said.

"And they rejoiced歡喜 (huānxǐ). Their hearts became full of joy, their minds became filled with happiness.

"They奉行 (fèngxíng) received it with faith and put it into practice, accepted it with devotion and carried it out, heard it with reverence and committed themselves to walking the path.

                            CLOSING REFLECTION

This here teaching—this sutra on seeing Universal Worthy Bodhisattva, on contemplating Samantabhadra, on practicing the path that reaches everywhere and leaves nobody behind—this is medicine for what ails you, this is water for your thirst, this is bread for your hunger.

The Buddha knew he was leaving. Three months, he said. Three months and I'm gone. So he gave this teaching like a father giving his children the keys to the house, the deed to the land, the map to the treasure.

He said: After I'm gone, you won't be alone. Universal Worthy will come if you call him. The Buddhas in ten directions will appear if you practice. Many Treasures tower will rise up if you're sincere. The six roots will get clean if you confess. The obstacles will fall away if you repent.

This ain't about being perfect before you start. This is about starting right where you are—in the mud, in the mess, in the confusion—and walking toward the light.

One step, then another step, then another step. One confession, then another confession, then another confession. One bow, then another bow, then another bow.

The path is long but the Buddhas are patient. Your sins are heavy but the Dharma is powerful. Your confusion is deep but the wisdom-light penetrates everything.

Six roots got you in trouble? Six mindfulnesses will get you out.
Eyes led you astray? Contemplating Buddha-bodies will bring you home.
Ears heard wrong sounds? Listening to Dharma will make you clean.
Tongue spoke evil? Praising the Triple Gem will purify your speech.

This teaching says: Don't wait till you're good to practice. Practice so you can become good. Don't wait till you're pure to confess. Confess so you can become pure. Don't wait till you're worthy to see the Buddhas. Call on the Buddhas so you can become worthy.

And when you practice like this—when you really practice, when you don't just read about it but do it, when you don't just think about it but live it—Universal Worthy comes riding on that white elephant, and the whole cosmos fills with enlightened ones, and your eyes see clear, and your ears hear true, and your mind knows peace.

Won't be long now. Won't be long.

The Buddhas are waiting. Universal Worthy is ready. The path is open.

All you got to do is walk it.

Amen and Amen
