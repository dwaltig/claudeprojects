# On Getting Free in This Very Life (A Blues Interpretation)
**A Blues Interpretation of Nichiren's *Isshō Jōbutsu Shō* (On Attaining Buddhahood in This Very Life)**

---

### The Background

Listen to me now. If you want to break them chains—the chains of birth and dying, coming and going, that been dragging you down since before time had a name—and if you want to wake up, truly wake up, right here in this very life, you got to see one thing. You got to see the Mystic Truth that’s already living right inside you.

That truth got a name: **Myoho-renge-kyo**.

So when you chant that rhythm, when you sing that song, you ain't calling on something far away. You grasping the truth that's beating in your own chest.

### The King of Songs

Now, the Lotus Sutra, that’s the King of Songs. It’s the straight talk. It’s the real deal. Every word in it is solid ground. And the ground it stands on is the **Mystic Law** (*myōhō*).

Why we call it "Mystic"? Because it reveals the secret: that one single heartbeat of your life holds the whole entire universe. Everything. That’s the wisdom of all the Buddhas, right there in your pulse.

### It’s All Inside You

Every moment you breathe, you holding everything.
You holding the body and the mind.
You holding yourself and your neighborhood.
You holding all the folks in the ten worlds—from the hell-bound to the heaven-bound.
You holding the plants, the sky, the earth, and every little speck of dust dancing in the light.

Every moment of life soaks through everything, and everything shines through every moment. Waking up ain't nothing but realizing this deep connection.

But listen close—this is where you can get tripped up.
Even if you chanting *Myoho-renge-kyo* till your throat gets dry, even if you believe it with all your might—**if you think that Law is outside of you, you ain't embracing the Mystic Law.** You grabbing hold of a shadow. You holding onto a "lesser teaching."

But don't get confused. The Law inside you needs a mirror to see itself clear. That's why we focus our faith on the Gohonzon—it's the map that shows the treasure you already own.

What’s a "lesser teaching"? It’s a temporary fix. It’s a side road. It’s a loving trick that was meant to get you started, not to get you home. Ain't no side road gonna lead you straight to the mountaintop. And without that direct path, you can practice for a million lifetimes, lifetime after lifetime, and you still won't wake up. Getting free in this lifetime? Impossible.

So when you chant *myōhō* and you recite *renge*, you got to summon up a faith deeper than the ocean. You got to believe that **Myoho-renge-kyo is your life itself.**

### Don't Look Outside

Don't you ever think that any of the eighty thousand teachings the Buddha preached are outside of you.
Don't you think any of them Buddhas or Bodhisattvas in all the universes are outside of you.

Your practice ain't gonna relieve one ounce of your suffering if you don't see the true nature of your own life.
If you go looking for enlightenment outside yourself, you can do ten thousand good deeds, you can pray ten thousand prayers, and it won't amount to a hill of beans.

It’s like a poor man spending all day and all night counting his neighbor’s money. He can count till he falls over, but he ain't gonna gain half a penny for himself.

That’s why the old masters said: **"If you don't see the nature of your own life, you can't wash away your heavy burdens."**
They said if you don't see who you really are, your practice is just endless, painful work. Just sweating for nothing. That ain't the Buddha's way. That’s wandering in the dark.

### Polish the Mirror

Whether you calling the Buddha’s name, reading the book, or just offering a simple flower—everything you do with a sincere heart plants a seed of goodness in your life. You got to strive with that conviction.

But hear this: "outside" and "inside" finally ain't two different places. When your faith breaks through, you see they was always one.

The old wisdom says: If you look for the Buddha’s freedom in the minds of ordinary folks, you gonna find that ordinary folks *are* the enlightenment. You gonna find that the suffering of birth and death *is* the peace of Nirvana.
It says if your mind is dirty, your world is dirty. If your mind is clean, your world is clean.
Ain't no such thing as a "pure land" or an "impure land" sitting out there by itself. The only difference is what’s going on in your own heart.

It’s the same with a Buddha and an ordinary person.
When you confused, we call you "ordinary."
When you wake up, we call you "Buddha."

Think about a tarnished mirror. Right now, it’s cloudy. It’s dusty. It’s covered in the grime of "I can't" and "I ain't." That’s the darkness of life.
But if you polish that mirror—oh, if you polish it!—it’s gonna shine like a jewel. It’s gonna reflect everything just as it is.

So wake up your faith! Polish your mirror day and night. Don't slack off.
And how do you polish it?
**Only by chanting Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.**

### The Mystery of the Rhythm

So what does *myō* mean?
It just means the mysterious nature of being alive, moment to moment.
Your mind can't figure it out. Words can't wrap around it.
You look into your mind, you can't see no shape, no color. You can't say "There it is."
But thoughts keep coming, feelings keep rising, so you can't say "It ain't there."

It ain't "existing" and it ain't "not existing." It’s something deeper. It’s the Middle Way. It’s the ultimate reality.
*Myō* is the name we give to that mysterious nature.
*Hō* is the name we give to how it shows up in the world.
*Renge*—the lotus flower—that’s the symbol for this wonder. The flower and the seed at the same time. Cause and effect.

If you understand that your life right now is *myō* (mystic), then you gonna understand that your life in every other moment is the Mystic Law.
And realizing that? That’s the mystic *kyō*—the sutra. The living teaching of your own life.

The Lotus Sutra is the King because it tells you straight: The reality of your life, whether you doing good or doing bad in this moment, is the entity of the Mystic Law itself.

### The Promise

If you chant **Nam-myoho-renge-kyo** with deep faith in this principle, and you keep that faith burning, you are guaranteed—you hear me?—**guaranteed** to attain Buddhahood in this lifetime.
That’s why the sutra promises: "After I’m gone, if you accept and hold this teaching, you will walk the Buddha way without a doubt."

Don't doubt it. Not even a little bit.

Respectfully.

Keep your faith. Get free in this life.
**Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.**
**Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.**
