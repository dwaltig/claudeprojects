## Part One: The Upper Volume

### Section 1: Who Deserves Your Respect? (Pages 50-53)

#### The Three Things Worth Bowing To

Listen up. There are only three things in this world that deserve your respect: **your leader, your teacher, and your parents.**

And there are only three teachings worth studying: **Confucianism, the non-Buddhist paths, and the Buddha's Law.**

Let me break all three down for you. Because most people are confused about where their loyalty should go.

---

#### I. The Limits of the Old Chinese Wisdom

**The Ancient Kings**

In the Confucian tradition, they talk about the Three Sovereigns, the Five Emperors, the Three Kings—the ancient rulers they call "Heavenly Honored Ones." They were the heads of state, the bridges between heaven and the common people.

Before the Three Sovereigns? People didn't even know who their fathers were. We were just animals running around.

After the Five Emperors, people figured out who their parents were and started practicing what they call *filial piety*—respecting your elders.

**Examples of Filial Piety**

Chong Hua—his father was a cruel, stubborn man, but Chong Hua honored him anyway. That's hard love.

Pei Gong became the emperor of Han, and even then, he still bowed to his old man.

King Wu carved a wooden statue of his dead father just to keep honoring him.

Ding Lan carved an image of his mother so he could bow to her even after she was gone.

These are the models of filial piety. Remember them.

**Examples of Loyalty**

Bi Gan saw that the Yin dynasty was about to collapse. He risked everything to tell the emperor the truth. They cut off his head for it.

Hong Yan—when his lord Duke Yi was killed and his body mutilated, Hong Yan cut open his own belly, put his lord's liver inside, and died protecting it.

These are the models of loyalty. Real loyalty costs you something.

**The Four Sages**

There were four great teachers in ancient China:
- Yin Shou taught King Yao
- Wu Cheng taught King Shun  
- Tai Gong Wang taught King Wen
- And Laozi? He taught Confucius himself.

They called these men the Four Sages. Even emperors bowed their heads to them. All the people pressed their palms together.

**The Three Mysteries**

These sages wrote over three thousand volumes of books. But guess what? All of it boils down to three ideas—the "Three Mysteries":

1. **Being** — Things exist. Duke of Zhou and his people said so.
2. **Non-Being** — Nothing really exists. Laozi and his crew.
3. **Both Being and Non-Being** — It's complicated. Zhuangzi's take.

*Xuan* means "dark." They're trying to figure out what was going on before your parents were even born. Some say we came from primal energy. Some say everything—high and low, pain and pleasure, right and wrong—it's all just natural, spontaneous, no reason for any of it.

---

#### The Problem

Here's the thing: **They don't know the past. They don't know the future.**

*Xuan* means dark. Hidden. Mysterious. And that's exactly what it is—a mystery they can't solve.

They can only see the present. Right now. Today.

In the present, they teach you benevolence and righteousness. Follow the rules, protect yourself, keep the peace. Break the rules? Your family goes down, your house falls.

These sages—they call themselves sages—but they can't see the past any more than you can see your own back. They can't see the future any more than a blind man can see what's in front of him.

Sure, if you govern your household well, practice filial piety, and hold tight to the Five Constants—benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, good faith—your peers will respect you. Your name will ring out. Wise kings will call for you. They'll make you a minister, or a teacher, or even hand you the throne. Heaven itself will come down and protect you.

When King Wu of Zhou took power, the Five Elders descended from heaven to serve him. When Emperor Guangwu rose, the Twenty-Eight Star Spirits came down and became his twenty-eight generals.

**But here's the fatal flaw:**

Because they don't know past or future, they can't save their parents after death. They can't save their sovereigns or their teachers in the next life. They don't know what's coming.

**They don't know gratitude that reaches across lifetimes.**

That means they're not real sages. Not really.

---

#### Confucius Knew His Limits

Even Confucius admitted it. He said: "In this land, there are no true sages. But in the West, there's someone called Buddha. *He's* the real sage."

That's why Confucianism is just the *entrance*—the front door to something bigger.

Confucius taught rites and music so that when the Buddha's Law arrived, people would understand discipline, concentration, and wisdom. He taught kings and ministers to know their rank. He taught about parents so people would know the height of filial piety. He taught about teachers so people would know devotion.

The Great Master Miaole said it straight: "The spread of Buddhism depends on this. Rites and music come first; the true Way opens up after."

Tiantai quoted the *Golden Light Sutra*: "All the good teachings in the world come from this sutra. If you truly understand worldly law, that itself is Buddha's Law."

And in his *Great Concentration and Insight*, Tiantai said: "I sent three sages to transform China." That's right—Confucius, Laozi, and Yan Hui were bodhisattvas in disguise, sent to get China ready.

---

#### II. The Indian Non-Buddhists: Going Higher But Still Falling

**The Hindu Gods and the Three Seers**

Second, let's talk about the non-Buddhist paths of India.

They worship Maheshvara—the three-eyed, eight-armed god—and Vishnu. They call these gods the compassionate father and merciful mother of all beings. They're the Heavenly Honored Ones, the sovereigns.

Then there are the Three Seers: Kapila, Ulūka, Ṛṣabha. These were the founding teachers of India's great philosophies—Sāṃkhya, Vaiśeṣika, and Jainism. They lived eight hundred years before and after the Buddha.

**The Four Vedas and Ninety-Five Schools**

The Three Seers' teachings are called the Four Vedas—sixty thousand volumes of scripture. By the time the Buddha appeared, the Six Non-Buddhist Teachers had studied all this and become the royal teachers of India. Their branch schools multiplied into ninety-five or ninety-six sects.

Their arrogance was higher than the highest heaven. Their stubbornness was harder than stone. Their philosophy was deep and clever—way beyond anything the Chinese had.

Some of them could see two or three past lives, or even seven. Some could illuminate eighty thousand kalpas of the past. Some claimed to know eighty thousand kalpas of the future.

Their ultimate teachings?
- "The effect exists within the cause."
- "The effect doesn't exist within the cause."  
- "The effect both exists and doesn't exist within the cause."

That's as far as their philosophy could go.

**Their Practices**

The good ones among them kept the five precepts and ten good precepts. They practiced meditation. They climbed up through the realms of form and formlessness, inch by inch like inchworms, thinking they were reaching nirvana.

**But from the highest heaven, they fell back into hell.** Not one of them stayed up there. They thought they'd never come back down—but they all came crashing down.

Because they were attached to their teachers' doctrines, they did crazy things:
- Bathing three times a day in the freezing Ganges during winter
- Pulling out their own hair
- Throwing themselves off cliffs
- Burning their bodies
- Branding the five spots on their bodies
- Going completely naked
- Killing horses, thinking it brought blessings
- Burning plants and trees
- Worshipping every tree they saw

The number of these wrong teachings? Beyond counting.

---

#### They Revered Their Teachers—But Couldn't Escape Death

They respected their teachers like the gods respect Indra, like ministers bow before the emperor.

But out of all ninety-five kinds of non-Buddhist teachings—whether they practiced good or evil—**not a single one escaped the cycle of birth and death.**

Those who served *good* teachers fell into the evil paths after two or three lifetimes.  
Those who served *evil* teachers fell into the evil paths in their very next life.

**The essential point:** Non-Buddhist teachings ultimately lead you to Buddhism. That's their purpose.

Some non-Buddhists even predicted: "In a thousand years, the Buddha will appear." Others said: "In a hundred years."

The *Nirvana Sutra* says: "All the scriptures of the non-Buddhists in the world are actually the Buddha's teachings, not the non-Buddhists' teachings."

The *Lotus Sutra* says: "They appear to have the three poisons; they seem to hold wrong views. But in this way, my disciples use expedient means to save living beings."

---

#### III. The Buddha: The Only Teacher Who Can Save You

Third is **the Great Awakened World-Honored One.**

He is:
- The Great Guide
- The Great Eye  
- The Great Bridge
- The Great Ship-Master
- The Great Field of Merit

...for all living beings.

The Four Sages and Three Seers? They call themselves sages—but they're really just ordinary people who haven't cut through their illusions. They call themselves wise—but they don't understand cause and effect. They're like babies.

Can you cross the sea of birth and death on their ship? Can you walk across the crossroads of the six paths on their bridge?

**No way.**

But our Great Teacher? He's already crossed even the subtle transformation-body birth and death. He's already overturned the root of fundamental ignorance. The small illusions of views and thoughts? Child's play.

**Fifty Years of Truth**

This Buddha—from his enlightenment at age thirty to his passing at age eighty—taught for fifty years. Every word, every phrase: true. Every sentence, every verse: no lies.

Even the words of the Confucian sages and Indian seers weren't totally wrong—their actions matched their intentions. But the Buddha? He's been a person who doesn't lie for countless kalpas.

So his fifty-plus years of teaching, compared to all the outer teachings and non-Buddhist paths? **This is the Great Vehicle. This is the real word of a real one.**

From the moment he sat under the Bodhi tree to the evening he passed away—everything he said was true.

---


### Section 2: The Only Real Thing (Pages 54-58)

#### Not All Buddha's Words Are Equal

Alright, now let me tell you something important: just because the Buddha said it doesn't mean it's the final word.

When you look at the Buddha's fifty-plus years of teaching—the eighty thousand treasuries of the Law—you find all kinds of stuff in there. Hinayana. Mahayana. Provisional teachings. True teachings. Exoteric. Esoteric. Gentle words. Harsh words. True words. False words. Right views. Wrong views.

**Only ONE thing is the Buddha's straight talk: the Lotus Sutra.**

That's the only thing that's the true word of all the Buddhas—past, present, and future, in all ten directions.

The World-Honored One himself pointed back at his first forty-plus years of teaching and said: "I haven't told you the truth yet." Then he pointed to the eight years of the Lotus Sutra and said: "Now I'm telling you the truth."

And what happened? The Buddha Many Treasures rose up from underground in a giant treasure tower and testified: "Everything he's saying is true."

Then all the Buddhas from every corner of existence gathered together and stuck out their long tongues all the way to the Brahma heaven.

These words are BRIGHT. Clearer than the sun on a cloudless day. Brighter than the full moon at midnight.

**Look up and believe. Bow your head and reflect.**

---

#### The Two Big Secrets in the Lotus Sutra

This sutra contains two great secrets that most schools don't even know exist.

The Kusha, Jōjitsu, Ritsu, Hossō, and Sanron schools? They don't even know the names of these secrets.

The Kegon and Shingon schools? They *stole* them and pretended they were their own.

**The doctrine of Three Thousand Realms in a Single Moment of Life**—this is hidden in the depths of the "Life Span" chapter of the Lotus Sutra's essential teaching.

Nāgārjuna saw it. Vasubandhu saw it. But they didn't bring it out.

Only Tiantai—the Great Master himself—embraced it and revealed it to the world.

---

#### Where Three Thousand Realms Comes From

Three Thousand Realms in a Single Moment of Life (*ichinen sanzen*) starts with the mutual possession of the Ten Worlds.

The Hossō and Sanron schools say there are eight worlds. They don't even know about ten. How could they know about mutual possession?

The Kusha, Jōjitsu, and Ritsu schools are based on the Āgama sutras. They only know six worlds. They don't know the four higher ones.

They say "There's only one Buddha in the ten directions" but they won't even admit there's a Buddha in each direction. They definitely don't say "All living beings have Buddha nature." They don't even let ONE person have Buddha nature.

So when these schools talk about "Buddhas in the ten directions" or "Buddha nature"—they stole that language from later Mahayana teachers. They didn't get it from their own scriptures.

---

#### The Pattern of Corruption: Stealing What Works

Here's the pattern, and it keeps repeating:

**Before the Buddha**, non-Buddhist teachers had shallow views.

**After the Buddha**, they heard the Dharma, realized their own teachings were weak, got clever, and started *stealing* Buddhist ideas. They smuggled them into their own systems and made their wrong views even deeper.

Same thing happened in China. Before Buddhism arrived, the Confucianists and Taoists were gentle and naive—like babies. But after Buddhism came in the Later Han period and started winning debates, some Buddhist monks broke their precepts. Some went back to lay life. Some started pandering to secular power. And they smuggled Buddhist teachings into Confucianism and Taoism.

Tiantai called them out: "In this age there are many demon-monks who abandon the precepts and return to lay life. They become Taoists. They chase fame and profit. They brag about Zhuangzi and Laozi. They steal Buddhist meanings and put them in heretical texts. They press down what's high to make it low. They crush what's honorable to make it base. They pretend everything is equal."

**That's what corruption looks like. Theft disguised as wisdom.**

---

#### The Rise and Fall of Buddhist Schools in China

Buddhism followed the same pattern.

After Buddhism reached China, the heretical texts were refuted. But then different Buddhist schools arose—the "three of the South and seven of the North"—and they were at each other's throats like orchids and chrysanthemums competing for attention.

Then came Tiantai—the Great Master Zhiyi of the Chen and Sui dynasties—and he defeated them all. Buddhism saved the people again.

Later, the Hossō school came from India. The Shingon school came. The Kegon school arose. The Hossō school was a constant enemy of Tendai—fire and water. But when Xuanzang and his disciple Cien actually read Tiantai's commentaries, something happened. They mentally submitted. They didn't abandon their own school publicly, but in their hearts, they knew Tiantai was right.

---

#### The Great Theft

The Kegon and Shingon schools were originally based on *provisional* sutras. They were *provisional* schools.

But then the Shingon masters—Shubhakarasiṃha and Vajrabodhi—stole Tiantai's doctrine of Three Thousand Realms, made it the core of their own school, and added mudrās and mantras on top.

Then they claimed they *surpassed* Tiantai.

Scholars who don't know the history think: "Oh, the Three Thousand Realms doctrine came from India in the Mahāvairocana Sutra."

**No. It didn't. They stole it from Tiantai.**

The Kegon school did the same thing. Chengguan stole Tiantai's doctrine and inserted it into the Kegon passage "The mind is like a skilled painter."

People don't know this. But I'm telling you.

---

#### Dengyō Sets It Straight

In Japan, the six older schools—Kegon, Sanron, Hossō, and the rest—arrived before Tendai.

Then the Great Master Dengyō appeared.

He didn't just refute the six schools' wrong views. He *exposed* how the Shingon school had stolen the Lotus Sutra's principle and pretended it was their own.

Dengyō abandoned the different attachments of the various school teachers. He argued solely on the basis of the sutras themselves.

And he won.

Eight high priests. Twelve. Fourteen. Over three hundred. Even Kōbō Daishi—the founder of Shingon in Japan.

**All defeated.**

Everyone in Japan submitted to Tendai. The temples of Nara, Tō-ji, all the mountain temples—they all became branch temples of Mount Hiei.

It was also revealed that the founders of the Chinese schools had escaped the error of slandering the Law only by submitting to Tiantai.

---

#### The Decline

But then—as the world declined and people's wisdom grew shallow—Tendai's profound teaching was lost.

People stopped studying. The other schools got stronger. Tendai got weaker.

In the end, Tendai was pressed down not just by the six and seven older schools, but by schools that were even more worthless: **Zen** and **Pure Land**.

First, the lay patrons drifted to the wrong schools. Then—and this is the tragedy—even the eminent priests of Tendai, the ones people revered as great teachers, fell away and started *helping* the wrong schools.

The rice paddies and estates were taken. The correct Law was lost.

And the protective deities—Tenshō Daijin, Shōhachiman, Sannō—either couldn't taste the flavor of the Law anymore, or they left the country.

**That's why the demons got in. That's why this country is on the verge of ruin.**

---

#### The Two Great Things the Lotus Reveals

Now, with my foolish views, I've examined the difference between the first forty-plus years and the final eight years. The differences are many, but the two that everyone—scholars and myself—agrees are most important are:

1. **The Two Vehicles can attain Buddhahood.**
2. **The Buddha's life is eternal—he attained enlightenment in the remote past, not just under the Bodhi tree.**

These are the game-changers.

---

#### The Predictions in the Lotus

When you read the Lotus Sutra, you find:
- Shariputra becomes the Buddha Flower Glow
- Kashyapa becomes the Buddha Light Bright
- Subhuti becomes the Buddha Rare Form
- Katyayana becomes the Buddha Jāmbūnada Gold Light
- Maudgalyayana becomes the Buddha Sandalwood Fragrance
- Purna becomes the Buddha Law Bright
- Ananda becomes the Buddha Mountain Sea Wisdom King
- Rāhula becomes the Buddha Treading Seven Treasure Flowers
- The five hundred and seven hundred disciples become Buddhas called Universal Brightness
- The two thousand voice-hearers become the Buddha Jewel Form
- Even Mahāprajāpatī and Yashodharā—the women—become Buddhas Seen with Joy and Endowed with Glowing Marks

When you read the Lotus, these people look honored and noble.

But when you open the *earlier* sutras? **You're shocked.**

---

#### The Contradiction

Here's the problem: The Buddha is a person who speaks the truth. That's why he's called a sage, a great person.

Even the sages of the outer teachings are called sages because they speak truly. But the Buddha surpasses them all—that's why he's called a *great* person.

This great person said: "The Thus Come One appeared in the world for one great purpose alone." He said: "I have not yet revealed the truth." He said: "Now I must proclaim the truth." He said: "Honestly discarding expedient means."

The Buddha Many Treasures testified. The emanation Buddhas stuck out their tongues.

So who could doubt that Shariputra will become Flower Glow? That Kashyapa will become Light Bright?

---

#### But Wait—The Earlier Sutras Say Something Different

**Here's the thing:** The earlier sutras are also the Buddha's words.

The *Flower Garland Sutra* says: "The Buddha's wisdom, the great medicine king tree, can benefit everywhere *except* two places: the great pit of the two vehicles, and the water of wrong views where beings have destroyed their good roots."

What does that mean? In the Snow Mountains there's a tree called the Great Medicine King Tree. It's the king of all trees—168,000 *yojanas* tall. All the plants follow its cycle of roots, branches, flowers, and fruits.

This tree is compared to Buddha nature. All beings are compared to the plants.

But the tree doesn't grow in fire or water. The minds of the two vehicles are like fire. The minds of *icchantikas*—people with no faith—are like water.

The sutra is saying: **These two types can NEVER become Buddhas.**

---

#### The Condemnation

The *Great Collection Sutra* says it even more harshly:

"There are two types of people who will surely die and never live, who will never know or repay their debts of gratitude. They are the voice-hearers and the cause-awakened ones. It's like someone who falls into a deep pit and can't help themselves or anyone else. The voice-hearers and cause-awakened ones are the same—they've fallen into the pit of liberation and can't help anyone."

That's the condemnation of the two vehicles in the earlier sutras.

---

#### Gratitude Is Everything

Let me remind you of something fundamental.

The three thousand volumes of the outer texts—Confucianism and the rest—boil down to two things: **filial piety** and **loyalty**. And loyalty comes from filial piety.

*Filial* (孝) sounds like *high* (高). The heavens are high, but not higher than filial piety.  
*Filial* also sounds like *profound* (厚). The earth is profound, but not more profound than filial piety.

Sages and worthies come from the house of filial piety.

**How much more should those who study the Buddha's Law know gratitude and repay it!**

The disciples of the Buddha must know the four debts of gratitude—to parents, to sovereign, to all living beings, and to the Three Treasures—and practice knowing and repaying gratitude.

---


### Section 3: The Great Reversal (Pages 59-65)

#### The Voice-Hearers Forgot About Gratitude

Now here's the thing about Shariputra, Kashyapa, and the rest of the Buddha's top disciples—the "voice-hearers."

They kept all two hundred and fifty precepts. They followed all three thousand rules of conduct. They did everything right.

But by entering the path where they could never become Buddhas, **they became people who forgot about gratitude.**

That's the tragic irony. They were so good at following the rules that they trapped themselves.

---

#### What the Vimalakirti Sutra Says

Now let me quote you something that will blow your mind.

The *Vimalakirti Sutra* records this conversation:

Vimalakirti asked Manjushri: "What is the seed of Buddhahood?"

Manjushri answered: "All the afflictions and defilements are the seed of the Buddha. Even someone who's committed the five worst sins can still wake up and walk the path."

The sutra also says: "You know where the lotus flower grows? Not on the high plateau. Not on dry land. It grows in the low, muddy, stinking fields."

And then this: "Someone who's already become an arhat—a 'true saint'—can NEVER again arouse the aspiration for the Way. Their faculties are destroyed. It's like a eunuch who can't enjoy the five pleasures anymore."

What does all this mean?

- **Greed, anger, and ignorance** can become the seed of Buddhahood.
- **Killing your own father** can become the seed of Buddhahood.
- **The high, dry ground** produces no lotus flowers.
- **But the two vehicles?** They can NEVER become Buddhas.

---

#### The Paradox That Sounds Like Heresy

Let me break this down for you, because it sounds crazy:

When you compare the **good deeds** of the two vehicles with the **evil deeds** of ordinary people, **the evil of ordinary people can lead to Buddhahood**—but the good of the two vehicles cannot.

The Hinayana sutras say: "Don't do evil. Do good."

But this sutra says: "The good of the two vehicles is worse than the evil of ordinary people."

It sounds like a non-Buddhist teaching! It sounds upside down!

But the essential point is this: **The Buddha is establishing, with all his force, that the two vehicles can NEVER attain Buddhahood.**

---

#### More Condemnations

The *Vaipulya Dhāraṇī Sutra* records this:

Manjushri asked Shariputra: "Can a withered tree flower again?"  
"No."  
"Can water flow back up a mountain?"  
"No."  
"Can a broken stone be made whole?"  
"No."  
"Can a burnt seed sprout?"  
"No."

Manjushri said: "Then why are you asking me about receiving the prediction of Buddhahood with joy? **Your seed is burnt.**"

---

#### More Sutras Pile On

The *Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra* says: "O heavenly beings, if you haven't aroused the aspiration for complete enlightenment, arouse it now! But if someone enters the settled stage of the voice-hearers, that person can NEVER arouse the aspiration for enlightenment. Why? Because they've created an obstruction to birth and death."

The *Shūraṅgama Sutra* says: "A person who's committed the five cardinal sins—if they hear this samādhi and arouse the aspiration—can still become a Buddha. But an arhat who's exhausted all outflows is like a broken vessel. They can never receive this samādhi."

---

#### The Cruelest Line of All

And then the *Vimalakirti Sutra* delivers the cruelest blow:

"One who gives offerings to you does not plant a field of merit. One who makes offerings to you will fall into the three evil paths."

Let that sink in.

The Buddha is saying: **If you make offerings to Kashyapa and Shariputra—the holiest monks—you will fall into hell, the realm of hungry ghosts, or the animal realm.**

---

#### Shame Beyond Measure

These holy monks! Apart from the Buddha himself, everyone thought they were the eyes of humanity, the guides of all beings.

And yet, in front of countless great assemblies—humans, heavenly beings, dragons, asuras—the Buddha said these things **over and over and over again**.

What was his intention? Was he trying to shame his own disciples to death?

He used countless comparisons to rebuke them:
- Cow's milk versus donkey's milk
- Earthen vessels versus gold vessels  
- Fireflies versus sunlight

Not just one or two words. Not one or two days. Not one or two months or years. **For more than FORTY YEARS**, in countless sutras, before countless assemblies, he never said a single word of approval.

Only criticism. Only rebuke.

And because the World-Honored One doesn't lie, everyone knew this. I know it. You know it. Heaven knows it. Earth knows it. Hundreds, thousands, millions of beings from the three realms, from the ten directions—they all went back to their own lands and told everyone:

"Kashyapa and Shariputra will NEVER attain Buddhahood. Making offerings to them is a mistake."

---

#### The Great Contradiction

**Now here's the problem.**

After forty-plus years of saying this, in the final eight years, the Buddha suddenly reverses himself.

The Lotus Sutra says: "The two vehicles WILL attain Buddhahood."

Can you imagine how the assembly felt?

They're supposed to believe this? After everything they heard for forty years? They can't just flip a switch in their heads!

If they believe the Lotus, then the earlier sutras become lies.  
If they don't believe the Lotus, then... what was the point?

People must have been thinking: "Maybe a demon has possessed the Buddha. Maybe this isn't really him speaking."

And then the Buddha made it worse—or better, depending on how you look at it. He gave **specific predictions**. He named the kalpas, the lands, the names of the Buddhas that each voice-hearer would become. He told them who their disciples would be.

So now the Buddha's own words contradict each other. This is called **self-contradiction**.

This is why the non-Buddhists laughed at the Buddha and called him a great liar.

---

#### The Treasure Tower Appears

The assembly was stunned. The Buddha was trying to explain, but the doubts kept coming. He seemed at a loss.

And then it happened.

From the eastern direction, from the World of Treasure Purity, the **Buddha Many Treasures** came.

He arrived in a seven-jeweled stupa—five hundred yojanas high, two hundred fifty yojanas wide. The stupa rose from the earth, floated into the sky, and hung there—touching neither earth nor heaven. Suspended in mid-air.

Like the full moon rising from the eastern mountains on a pitch-black night.

And from inside the stupa, a voice like thunder:

**"Excellent, excellent! Shakyamuni, World-Honored One! You are teaching the Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Law—the great impartial wisdom, the Law of the bodhisattvas, protected by all Buddhas—to this great assembly. SO IT IS, SO IT IS! What you have taught is ALL TRUE!"**

Then the Buddha displayed his great supernatural powers. He stuck out his long, broad tongue all the way to the Brahma heaven. Light poured from every pore. And the Buddhas of the ten directions, sitting on their lion thrones beneath jeweled trees, did the same—stuck out their tongues, emitted immeasurable light.

---

#### Why the Lotus Is Different From Every Other Sutra

Now, in other sutras, Buddhas appeared and tongues extended. But let me tell you why the Lotus is different.

In the *Flower Garland Sutra*, there was no prior sutra to contradict—so no great doubt arose.

The *Great Collection*, *Perfection of Wisdom*, *Golden Light*, and *Amida* sutras were expounded to rebuke the two vehicles—but only to break the Hinayana idea that "there's only one Buddha in the ten directions."

Those sutras had partial contradictions. The Lotus has **total contradiction**—the earlier Mahayana sutras versus the Lotus. The voice-hearers, bodhisattvas, and heavenly beings were asking: **"Has a demon possessed the Buddha?"**

That's the drama. That's why the cosmic testimony was needed.

---

#### The Blindness of Other Schools

Yet the followers of the Kegon, Hossō, Sanron, Shingon, and Nembutsu schools—with their clouded eyes—think their sutras are the same as the Lotus.

Their eyes are pathetic.

---

#### The Earlier Sutras Look Stronger

Here's the hard truth:

The earlier sutras have many words; the Lotus is brief.  
The earlier sutras span many years; the Lotus is only eight.  
The earlier sutras are many; the Lotus is one.

If the Buddha is a liar, he should never be believed. If you establish belief on top of disbelief, you might believe the earlier sutras—but you should never believe the Lotus.

Even today, everyone SEEMS to believe the Lotus. But they don't really believe it.

Why? Because they happily follow teachers who say: "The Lotus and the *Mahāvairocana* are the same. The Lotus and the *Flower Garland* are the same. The Lotus and the *Amida* are the same."

And they reject those who say: "These sutras are DIFFERENT."

---

#### I, Nichiren, Say This

In the seven hundred-plus years since Buddhism came to Japan, **only Dengyō truly read the Lotus Sutra.**

People don't accept this. But the Lotus itself says:

"Even if you took Mount Sumeru and hurled it across the universe—that's not difficult. But if, after the Buddha's passing, in an evil age, you can preach this sutra—THAT is truly difficult."

My strong assertion matches the sutra.

The *Nirvana Sutra* says: "In the Latter Day, those who slander the Law will be like the soil of the ten directions. Those who uphold the correct Law will be like the soil on a fingernail."

Are the people of Japan the soil on the fingernail?  
Am I, Nichiren, the soil of the ten directions?

Think about it.

In the age of a wise king, reason prevails.  
In the age of a foolish ruler, unreason prevails.  
In the age of a sage, the true meaning of the Lotus is revealed.

---

#### The Two Great Revelations

Now let me sum up the two great differences between the earlier sutras and the Lotus:

**First: The Two Vehicles Attaining Buddhahood**

If the earlier sutras are right, Shariputra and the rest will NEVER become Buddhas. How grieved they must be!

**Second: The Buddha's Eternal Life**

The historical Buddha—born as Prince Siddhārtha, enlightened at thirty, passed away at eighty—that's what everyone thought.

But wait. At the very beginning, in the *Flower Garland Sutra*, the Buddha manifested the Lotus Treasury World, expounded the ten profound principles, gathered the Buddhas and bodhisattvas. If everything was revealed there, why hide anything?

Yet the *Flower Garland* has a flaw: it says the two vehicles and icchantikas can NEVER become Buddhas. And it says "I have NOW for the FIRST TIME attained enlightenment" in three places.

That's a cracked jewel. Moon behind clouds. Sun in eclipse.

All the lesser sutras—Āgama, Vaipulya, Perfection of Wisdom, Mahāvairocana—they all say "I have now for the first time attained enlightenment."

Even the *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra*—the prologue to the Lotus—says: "I sat beneath the bodhi tree for six years and attained enlightenment."

Even in the theoretical teaching of the Lotus itself—"Only a Buddha together with a Buddha," "Honestly discarding expedient means"—even THERE, the Buddha says: "At first I sat in the place of enlightenment, contemplating the tree, walking back and forth."

The Life Span chapter and the enlightenment of the remote past were STILL concealed!

This is the greatest mystery of all.

#### Maitreya's Question Sets Up the Revelation

So in the "Emerging from the Earth" chapter, when countless bodhisattvas appeared—bodhisattvas no one had ever seen in forty-plus years—and the Buddha said "I taught these bodhisattvas and caused them first to arouse the aspiration for the Way," Maitreya had to ask:

"World-Honored One, when you were a prince, you left the Shākya palace, went near Gayā, sat in the place of enlightenment, and attained perfect enlightenment. That was barely forty-plus years ago. How is it that in such a SHORT TIME you've accomplished such GREAT Buddha work?"

And that's where the Life Span chapter begins...

---


### Section 4: The Real Buddha Steps Forward (Pages 66-70)

#### The Buddha's Bombshell Answer

So Maitreya asks his question: "How could you have done all this Buddha work in just forty years?"

And here's how the Buddha answers.

First, he states what everyone believes:

"All the heavenly beings and humans, all the asuras—everyone thinks that I, Shakyamuni Buddha, left the Shākya palace, sat near Gayā, and attained enlightenment for the first time."

Then he drops the bombshell:

**"However, good sons, the truth is that I attained Buddhahood immeasurable, boundless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of kalpas ago."**

Read that again.

He's not saying he's been a Buddha for a long time. He's saying he's been a Buddha for a time beyond time. Before any beginning.

---

#### The Two Faults of Every Other Sutra

The *Flower Garland*, the *Perfection of Wisdom*, the *Mahāvairocana*—they all have two faults:

**Fault One:** They keep the teaching progressive. They never "open" the provisional teachings to show they were just expedients. That means they hide the three thousand realms in a single moment of life.

**Fault Two:** They say "the Buddha first attained enlightenment." That means they hide the Buddha's eternal life.

These two doctrines—**Ichinen Sanzen** and **Kuon Jitsujō** (Enlightenment in the Remote Past)—are the backbone of all the Buddha's teachings. They're the heart and marrow of everything.

---

#### Even the Theoretical Teaching Has Limits

Now, the "Expedient Means" chapter of the Lotus—the theoretical teaching—does reveal the three thousand realms and the two vehicles' Buddhahood. So it escapes one of those two faults.

But it hasn't yet revealed the Buddha's eternal life. So the three thousand realms isn't fully manifest. The two vehicles' Buddhahood isn't fully settled.

It's like seeing the moon reflected in water.  
It's like a rootless plant floating on the waves.

Beautiful—but not the real thing.

---

#### The Essential Teaching Shatters Everything

When we come to the essential teaching—the "Life Span" chapter—and shatter "first enlightenment," we shatter the whole framework.

The fruit of all four teachings: **shattered.**  
The cause of all four teachings: **shattered.**  
The cause and effect of the pre-Lotus and theoretical teaching: **demolished.**

What arises instead is the cause and effect of the essential teaching.

**This is Original Cause and Original Effect.**

The nine worlds are endowed with the beginningless Buddha world.  
The Buddha world is endowed with the beginningless nine worlds.

THIS is the true mutual possession of the Ten Worlds.  
THIS is the real three thousand realms in a single moment of life.

---

#### All Those Other Buddhas? Just Reflections

Now look back at all the Buddhas from other sutras:

- The Buddha on the lotus pedestal in the *Flower Garland*
- The little Shakyamuni in the *Āgama* sutras
- The mixed Shakyamuni in the *Vaipulya* and *Perfection of Wisdom*
- The Shakyamuni of the *Golden Light*
- The Buddhas of the *Amida Sutra*
- The Buddhas of the *Mahāvairocana* and other sutras

**All of them are just the moon of the Life Span chapter floating its reflection in different bowls of water.**

The scholars of the various schools don't understand their own schools nearby, and they definitely don't understand the Life Span chapter far off.

They mistake the moon in the water for the real moon. Some of them want to jump in the pond and grab it. Some want to tie a rope around it and hold it fast.

Tiantai said it perfectly: **"They don't recognize the moon in the sky; they only gaze at the moon in the pond."**

---

#### Nichiren's Honest Assessment

Let me be honest with you.

Even the two vehicles attaining Buddhahood seems to favor the earlier sutras' position. But the revelation of the Buddha's eternal life? That's incomparably more favorable to the pre-Lotus view!

Why? Because when you compare the pre-Lotus to the Lotus, the pre-Lotus already seems stronger—it has more words, more sutras, more years of teaching.

And it's not just the pre-Lotus sutras. The fourteen chapters of the theoretical teaching agree with them completely. Even among the fourteen chapters of the essential teaching, ALL of them except "Emerging from the Earth" and "Life Span" maintain the "first enlightenment" position!

The *Great Parinirvāṇa Sutra*—all forty volumes, the Buddha's final teaching at the twin śāla trees—not a single word teaches the revelation of the eternal Buddha. They teach that the *dharma body* is eternal, but not the Buddha as we know him.

So how can we abandon all those vast teachings and follow ONLY two chapters?

---

#### The Hossō School Speaks

Let me tell you about the Hossō school.

Nine hundred years after the Buddha's death, in India, there was a great teacher named Asaṅga. At night, he ascended to Tuṣita heaven and met face to face with Maitreya Bodhisattva to resolve his doubts. By day, he spread the Hossō teaching in Ayodhyā.

His disciples were giants: Vasubandhu, Dharmapāla, Nanda, Śīlabhadra. King Harsha himself bowed to them. All of India submitted.

Then Xuanzang—the famous Chinese pilgrim—spent seventeen years in India, traveled through 130 countries, and brought this teaching back to China. He gave it to Emperor Taizong, the wisest of emperors. His disciples spread it to 360 countries.

In Japan, during Emperor Kōtoku's reign, Japanese monks brought it back and enshrined it at Yamashina Temple.

This should be the foremost school of India, China, and Japan combined!

---

#### What Hossō Says

And here's what Hossō says:

"From the beginning of the *Flower Garland* to the end of the *Lotus* and *Nirvana*, those of indeterminate nature and those fixed in the two-vehicle path can NEVER become Buddhas.

The Buddha's word is final. Once he said 'never,' it means NEVER. Even if the sun and moon fell to earth, even if the great earth flipped upside down—the Buddha's word doesn't change.

So even in the *Lotus* and *Nirvana*, those people are never EXPLICITLY named and told they'll become Buddhas.

Think about it: If the Lotus really said those people would become Buddhas, wouldn't Asaṅga have seen it? Wouldn't Vasubandhu have recorded it? Wouldn't Xuanzang have transmitted it? Wouldn't they have asked Maitreya directly?

You think you're following the *Lotus Sutra*, but you're actually just accepting the biased views of Tiantai, Miaole, and Dengyō. You're reading the sutra through THEIR lens. That's why you think the pre-Lotus and the Lotus are like fire and water."

---

#### The Kegon and Shingon Schools Speak

Now for the Kegon and Shingon schools—they claim to be way above Hossō and Sanron.

They say:

"The two vehicles attaining Buddhahood? The Buddha's eternal life? Those aren't LIMITED to the *Lotus Sutra*! They're clearly stated in the *Flower Garland* and the *Mahāvairocana* too!

Look at OUR lineage: Dushun, Zhiyan, Fazang, Chengguan for Kegon. Shubhakarasiṃha, Vajrabodhi, Amoghavajra for Shingon. These masters are way higher than Tiantai or Dengyō!

And Shubhakarasiṃha has an UNBROKEN lineage from Mahāvairocana Buddha himself. How could manifestation-body sages like these be wrong?

The *Flower Garland* says: 'Some see that Shakyamuni attained Buddhahood inconceivable kalpas ago.'

The *Mahāvairocana* says: 'I am the origin of all.'

So why should the eternal Buddha be limited to the Life Span chapter?

You're like a frog in a well who's never seen the ocean. You're like a country bumpkin who's never been to the capital."

---

#### What About Nāgārjuna and Vasubandhu?

Someone asks: "What do Nāgārjuna and Vasubandhu say about all this?"

Answer: These two wrote treatises on both Mahayana and Hinayana. They're the source of ALL the schools.

But in their treatises, they don't say Shingon or Kegon is superior. They don't say the *Lotus Sutra* is foremost. They don't call it the king of sutras. They don't say it "reveals the truth."

---

#### Nichiren's Challenge

Here's what I, Nichiren, say:

**You're trying to refute the essential teaching using the pre-Lotus and theoretical teachings.**

Has the revelation of the Buddha's eternal enlightenment EVER been taught in the pre-Lotus or theoretical teachings?

**In what sutra? In what fascicle?**

Show me.

---


### Section 5: The Sutra Saw My Life Coming (Pages 71-76)

#### The Lotus Sutra's Predictions

Let me quote the sutra to you:

"In all the world there are many resentful enemies, and it is difficult to believe."

"There will be those among the ignorant who will curse and speak ill of us."

"They will go to kings, ministers, Brahmans, and householders, slandering us, saying, 'These are people of wrong views.'"

"Again and again we will be banished."

"They will attack us with swords and staves, with tiles and stones."

---

#### This Is What Happens When You Tell the Truth

When you put moxibustion on a child's skin, the child hates their parents for it.

When you give strong medicine to a sick person, it tastes bitter in their mouth.

This was true even when the Buddha was alive. How much MORE true in the Latter Day of the Law, in this faraway land at the edge of the world!

**Mountains will pile on mountains.**  
**Waves will crash on waves.**  
**Difficulty will be added to difficulty.**  
**Wrongs will multiply upon wrongs.**

---

#### I Am the Proof

If the World-Honored One is a great liar, then the eighty ten thousand million nayutas of bodhisattvas should fall into the same sin as Devadatta—the deceiver who tried to kill the Buddha.

The sutra says: "There will be ignorant people who curse and speak ill of us, who attack us with swords and staves, with tiles and stones."

**Now look at the present world.**

Apart from me, Nichiren—which monk has ever been cursed and slandered by the masses on account of the Lotus Sutra?

Which monk has been attacked with swords and staves?

**The sutra text matches my body exactly.**

---

#### My Joy Increases

When the government comes down on me, my joy should only increase.

Think about it like this: In the Hinayana tradition, there are bodhisattvas who haven't yet cut through their illusions. They practice something called "vow that combines with karma."

Even though they don't WANT to commit sins, when they see their parents and loved ones fall into hell and suffer, they deliberately create similar karma. They VOW to fall into hell themselves. And they REJOICE in being able to take on the same suffering in place of the ones they love.

That's what I'm doing. The persecution is proof that I'm on the right path.

---

#### The Protectors Will Come

If the water is clear, the moon won't hold back its reflection.  
If the wind blows, the trees and grasses WILL bend.

If there's a true practitioner of the Lotus Sutra, the protective deities will come to that person.

**Even through fire. Even through solid stone.**

They will come.

---

#### Remember the Voice-Hearers' Humiliation

Let me remind you what the voice-hearers went through.

Throughout all the sutras of the first four flavors—milk, cream, curds, butter—they received rebuke after rebuke. They were humiliated in front of countless assemblies of humans and heavenly beings.

Kashyapa wept so hard that his sobbing shook the three thousand worlds.

Subhuti was so stunned, so dazed, that he dropped his begging bowl right out of his hand.

---

#### The Great One's Purpose

The Buddha proclaimed: "I have appeared in the world for one great purpose alone."

This is why the six non-Buddhist teachers laughed at him and called him a great liar.

The voice-hearers—though they were of noble birth, though they had attained the fruit of arhatship—were told they could NEVER become Buddhas.

But then, on Eagle Peak, during the eight years of the Lotus Sutra, they were given Buddha-names: "Mountain Sea Wisdom," "Treading Seven Treasure Flowers," and the rest.

---

#### The Worst Humiliation

The greatest of all the humiliations came from the *Vimalakirti Sutra*:

"One who makes offerings to you does not plant a field of merit. One who makes offerings to you will fall into the three evil paths."

The scene: The Buddha was in Āmrapālī Park. Brahma was there. Indra. The sun and moon. The four heavenly kings. The gods of three realms. Earth gods. Dragon gods. An assembly as numberless as the sands of the Ganges.

And in front of ALL of them, the Buddha said: "If you make offerings to monks like Subhuti, you will fall into hell."

Can you imagine being Subhuti in that moment?

---

#### The Pre-Lotus Predictions Were Just Shadows

As for the great bodhisattvas and heavenly beings who SEEMED to receive predictions in the pre-Lotus sutras—it was like trying to grab the moon in the water. It was like mistaking a shadow for a body.

There was form and shape, but no real substance. The Buddha's benevolence seemed deep—but it wasn't truly deep.

Tiantai said it: "They don't recognize the moon in the sky; they only gaze at the moon in the pond."

The *Flower Garland* calls these bodhisattvas "good teachers." But what's a "good teacher"? It's neither an absolute teacher nor an absolute disciple. It's something in between.

---

#### The Buddha's Declaration at Age 72

When the Buddha was seventy-two years old, at Eagle Peak in Magadha, he taught the *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra*.

He listed all the sutras from the first forty-plus years, gathered all their branches and leaves together, and then completely negated them:

**"In these more than forty years, I have not yet revealed the truth."**

That's it. Forty years of teaching—not yet the truth.

---

#### What "Myō" Means

*Myō* means complete endowment. Perfect possession.

The "six" refers to the six pāramitās—the six perfections that all bodhisattvas practice: giving, ethics, patience, effort, meditation, and wisdom.

"Endowed" means the mutual possession of the Ten Worlds.  
"Complete" means that if one world contains ten worlds, then all the other worlds are present in that one world. Nothing is missing. Everything is full.

*Myōhō Renge Kyō* is the Chinese name.  
In India, they call it *Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra*.

---


### Section 6: End of Part One — The Name That Contains Everything (Pages 77-82)

#### One More Time: The Great One's Purpose

Let me say this again, because it's the foundation of everything.

The Buddha proclaimed: "I have appeared in the world for one great cause alone."

This is why the six non-Buddhist teachers laughed at him. This is why they called him a great liar.

The voice-hearers—noble by birth, realized in arhatship—had been told they could NEVER become Buddhas.

But then, at Eagle Peak, during those eight years, they received Buddha-names: Mountain Sea Wisdom, Treading Seven Treasure Flowers.

The liar? Or the one who finally told the whole truth?

---

#### The Worst Humiliation (One More Time)

The greatest of all the great difficulties came from the *Vimalakirti Sutra*:

"One who gives to you does not plant a field of merit. One who makes offerings to you will fall into the three evil paths."

Picture the scene: The Buddha in Āmrapālī Park. Brahma, Indra, the sun and moon, the four heavenly kings, all the gods, earth spirits, dragon spirits—an assembly as numberless as the sands of countless Ganges Rivers.

And the Buddha says, in front of ALL of them: "If you make offerings to monks like Subhuti, you will fall into hell."

That's the condemnation. That's what the voice-hearers lived with for forty years.

---

#### The Pre-Lotus Predictions Were Just Shadows

All those great bodhisattvas and heavenly beings who SEEMED to get predictions of Buddhahood in the earlier sutras?

It was like grabbing the moon in the water.  
It was like mistaking a shadow for a body.

Form and shape, yes. But no real substance inside.

The Buddha's kindness seemed deep. But it wasn't truly deep.

"They don't recognize the moon in the sky; they only gaze at the moon in the pond."

The *Flower Garland* calls these bodhisattvas "good teachers." But what's a "good teacher"? Not a full teacher. Not a full disciple. Something in between.

---

#### The Buddha's Negation at Age 72

When the Buddha was seventy-two years old, at Eagle Peak in Magadha, he taught the *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra*.

He listed all the sutras from the previous forty-plus years. He gathered all their branches and leaves.

And then he negated them completely:

**"In these more than forty years, I have not yet revealed the truth."**

Everything before? Not the truth yet.

---

#### The Name That Contains Everything

Now let me tell you about the title: **Myōhō Renge Kyō**.

**Myō** means "wonderful." But it also means *complete endowment*. Everything is already there.

The "six" refers to the six perfections—the practices that all bodhisattvas do: giving, ethics, patience, effort, meditation, wisdom.

**Gu** (endowed) means the mutual possession of the Ten Worlds. Every world contains every other world.

**Soku** (complete) means this: if one world contains ten worlds, then all the other worlds are present right here, right now. Nothing is missing. Everything is full.

**Myōhō Renge Kyō** is the Chinese name.

In India, they call it **Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra**: The Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Law.

---

### End of Part One (Upper Volume)

---


## Part Two: The Lower Volume

### Section 7: The Original Disciples and the Question of Proof (Pages 83-95)

#### From Now On: The True Disciples

Listen carefully, because everything shifts here.

From THIS moment on—from the revelation of the eternal Buddha—all the great bodhisattvas, Brahma, Indra, the sun and moon, the four heavenly kings—ALL of them truly became disciples of Shakyamuni Buddha.

That's why, in the "Treasure Tower" chapter, the Buddha addressed them directly. He said: "I'm speaking to all of you. After I pass away, who's going to protect and uphold this sutra? Who's going to read it? Recite it? **Right now, in front of me, make your vow.**"

---

#### The Flower Garland World: Buddhas Stayed Home

In the *Flower Garland Sutra*, there's this realm called the Lotus Treasury World. The reward-body Buddhas of the ten directions each stay in their own countries. They don't come here and call themselves emanations. Our Buddha doesn't go there either.

Only the great bodhisattvas—like Dharma Wisdom—travel back and forth between the assemblies.

But that's not what happened in the Lotus Sutra.

---

#### Maitreya's Confusion

Maitreya Bodhisattva was thinking to himself:

"I've been with the Buddha since he was a crown prince. Through his enlightenment at thirty. All the way to this assembly at Eagle Peak—forty-two years.

I know EVERY bodhisattva in this world.  
I know EVERY great bodhisattva who's come from the ten directions.

I've traveled to pure lands and impure lands as the Buddha's messenger. I've wandered on my own. I've SEEN and HEARD the great bodhisattvas of every land.

**But I've NEVER seen these bodhisattvas who just emerged from the earth.**"

---

#### The Buddha's First Answer

The Buddha answered: "Ajita, these beings you've never seen before—when I attained enlightenment in this Sahā world, I taught them. I converted them. I guided them. I caused them to arouse the aspiration for the Way."

Wait—WHAT?

You taught them WHEN? In forty years? These countless multitudes?

---

#### Maitreya's Question That Changed Everything

Maitreya was so shocked he could barely speak. But something—maybe the Buddha's power—made him ask:

"World-Honored One, when you were a prince, you left the Shākya palace. You went near Gayā. You sat in the place of enlightenment. You attained perfect enlightenment. That was barely forty-plus years ago.

**How is it that in such a SHORT TIME you've accomplished such GREAT Buddha work?**"

That question is the hinge of the entire sutra. That question opens the door to the Life Span chapter.

---

#### The Life Span Chapter's Answer

The Buddha said: "Everyone thinks I left the palace, sat near Gayā, and attained enlightenment for the first time.

**But good sons, the truth is that I attained Buddhahood immeasurable, boundless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of kalpas ago.**"

Read that again.

Not forty years. Not four hundred years. Not four thousand years.

**A time beyond time. Before any beginning.**

---

#### What This Revelation Means

Now that the Buddha's eternal enlightenment is revealed, everything else falls into place:

- The bodhisattvas Sunlight and Moonlight who attend Medicine Master Buddha in the east?
- Perceiver of the World's Sounds and Great Power who attend Amida Buddha in the west?
- All the bodhisattvas of all the Buddhas of the ten directions?
- Even the bodhisattvas who serve Mahāvairocana in the Shingon tradition?

**ALL OF THEM are disciples of Shakyamuni.**

Every Buddha. Every bodhisattva. Every teaching. It all comes from the eternal Shakyamuni.

---

#### Other Schools Got the Wrong Buddha

Every school except Tendai is confused about who the Buddha really is.

The Kusha, Jōjitsu, and Ritsu schools worship a Shakyamuni who attained enlightenment by cutting through delusions in thirty-four mental stages. That's the historical Buddha—the limited Buddha.

It's like a king's son who gets confused and thinks he's the child of a commoner.

The Kegon, Shingon, Sanron, and Hossō schools are Mahayana schools—but they're still confused.

---

#### The Great Theft (Again)

Chengguan of the Kegon school stole Tiantai's doctrine and smuggled it into the *Flower Garland* passage "The mind is like a skilled painter."

The Shingon sutras—the *Mahāvairocana Sutra* and the rest—don't contain:
- The two vehicles attaining Buddhahood
- The Buddha's enlightenment in the remote past
- The three thousand realms in a single moment of life

So what did Shubhakarasiṃha do when he came to China? He read Tiantai's *Great Concentration and Insight*. He got enlightened BY TIANTAI. Then he stole the three thousand realms doctrine and inserted it into his sutra.

He added mudrās and mantras on top.

Then he claimed his tradition was "equal in principle but superior in practice."

**That's theft disguised as wisdom.**

---

#### Even the Great Masters Submitted

Jiaxiang of the Sanron school—in his ten-volume commentary, he classified the Lotus as fourth-period teaching. But when he actually met Tiantai, he submitted. He served him for seven years. He stopped giving lectures. He disbanded his followers. He offered his own body as a bridge for Tiantai to walk on.

Cien of the Hossō school—he wrote all those volumes claiming "The one vehicle is expedient, the three vehicles are real." But even HE hedged his bets in the fourth volume of his *Profound Meaning*, saying "Both views may be maintained."

These masters KNEW the power of Tiantai's arguments.

---

#### Nichiren's Agonizing Question

Now I, Nichiren, have to ask myself this:

The sun, the moon, the heavenly beings who were present at the two places and three assemblies of the Lotus Sutra—they made a VOW before the Buddha. They promised to protect the practitioners of this sutra.

If a true practitioner appears, they should come immediately—like a magnet attracting iron, like the moon moving to water. They should take the practitioner's place. They should fulfill their vow.

But they haven't come to help me.

**Is Nichiren NOT a practitioner of the Lotus Sutra?**

---

#### The Six Difficult and Nine Easy Acts

The Buddha said:

"Many Treasures Buddha and all my emanation Buddhas gathered here—understand this intention. Think carefully. This is a DIFFICULT matter. You should make a great vow.

All the other sutras are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges. Teaching them? Not difficult.

Grabbing Mount Sumeru and hurling it across the universe? Not difficult.

**But if, after my passing, in an evil age, one can preach this sutra—THAT is truly difficult.**"

---

#### Only Two Have Done This in Japan

In Japan, this Law has appeared twice.

Those who have done it are:

1. **The Great Master Dengyō**
2. **Nichiren**

Those without eyes may doubt this. But their power doesn't reach it.

This sutra passage—where Shakyamuni, Many Treasures, and the Buddhas of the ten directions gathered to determine the supremacy of all sutras in Japan, China, India, the dragon palace, the heavens, the entire ten directions—THIS is the standard.

---


### Section 8: The Fire, the Death, and the Threefold Vow (Pages 96-106)

#### The Test for Truth

Nāgārjuna said: "If it doesn't match the sutras, it's black doctrine. If it matches the sutras, it's white doctrine."

Tiantai said: "If it accords with the sutras, record it and use it. If it has no text and no meaning, don't believe it."

Dengyō said: "Rely on what the Buddha taught. Don't believe oral transmissions."

**The sutra is the standard. Period.**

---

#### Every Sutra Claims to Be Number One

The *Secret Adornment Sutra* says: "All the other sutras came from this one. This sutra is the best."

The *Great Cloud Sutra* says: "This sutra is the wheel-turning king of all sutras."

The *Profound Secrets Sutra* says: "In the third period, I turn the wheel of the correct Law with revealed characteristics. This is supreme."

The *Flower Garland* says: "To seek the Great Vehicle is still easy. To believe THIS Law is extremely difficult."

Every sutra's followers claim their sutra is number one. So how do you know which is true?

---

#### I Write This for You

Let me set all that aside. I write this for those of my school. Others won't believe—but even rejecting it creates a reverse connection. They'll get there eventually.

**Taste one drop and know the flavor of the ocean.**  
**See one flower and know that spring is coming.**

You don't have to travel ten thousand miles to Song China. You don't have to spend three years reaching Eagle Peak. You don't have to dive into the dragon palace like Nāgārjuna. You don't have to meet Maitreya like Asaṅga did. You don't have to be at the two places and three assemblies.

**You can know the truth from right where you are.**

A snake knows about floods seven days ahead—because it's related to dragons.  
A crow knows the fortunes of the year—because it was a diviner in a past life.  
A bird's flight surpasses anything a human can do.

**My knowledge of the sutras surpasses Chengguan of Kegon, Jiaxiang of Sanron, Cien of Hossō, and Kōbō of Shingon.**

Why? Because I follow Tiantai and Dengyō.

---

#### The Limits of Confucian Filial Piety

Confucian filial piety only works in this life. It can't help your parents in future lives. So the Confucian sages have name but no substance.

Non-Buddhists might know past and future, but they can't help their parents after death. Only Buddhism can do that—only Buddhism deserves the name of wisdom.

But even the Buddhist teachings before the Lotus Sutra can't guarantee YOUR enlightenment—let alone your parents'. There's text, but no real meaning.

Only NOW, with the Lotus Sutra:
- Women can become Buddhas → our mothers can be saved
- The evil Devadatta becomes a Buddha → our fathers can be saved

**This sutra is the filial piety sutra of Buddhism.**

---

#### The One Called Nichiren Had His Head Struck Off

Now let me tell you something.

The one called Nichiren—last year, on the twelfth day of the ninth month, between the hours of the Rat and the Ox—around midnight—**his head was struck off.**

This is his soul. It arrived at Sado province. And in the second month of the following year, in the snow, he writes this and sends it to his disciples.

**It's fearsome—but also not fearsome.**

Those who see this—how frightened they must be!

This document is a bright mirror. In it, Shakyamuni, Many Treasures, and the Buddhas of the ten directions have reflected the future of present-day Japan.

**Look upon this as a keepsake from me.**

---

#### The "Encouraging Devotion" Chapter Predicted Everything

The sutra says:

"We beg you not to worry. After you pass away, in an age of fear and evil, we'll teach widely. Ignorant people will curse and slander us. They'll attack us with swords and staves. We'll endure all of it.

The monks of that evil age—with their twisted wisdom and their fawning, crooked hearts—will claim they've attained what they haven't attained. Their hearts will be swollen with arrogance."

---

#### The Nirvana Sutra's Warning

"After my passing, in the Latter Day... there will be monks who LOOK like they keep the precepts. They read a little scripture. But they're greedy for food and drink. They fatten their bodies.

They proclaim, 'I've attained arhatship!'

Outwardly they seem virtuous. Inwardly they harbor greed and jealousy. They're not real monks—just monk costumes. Burning with wrong views, they slander the correct Law."

---

#### Tiantai and Dengyō Named the Enemies

Tiantai said: "In the Middle Day of the Law, the three schools of the south and seven schools of the north are enemies of the Lotus Sutra."

Dengyō said: "At the end of the Middle Day, the six schools of Nara are enemies of the Lotus Sutra."

In their time, things weren't fully clear yet.

But HERE'S THE THING: This prediction was made when Shakyamuni and Many Treasures sat side by side like the sun and moon inside the treasure tower. When all the emanation Buddhas were arranged beneath the jeweled trees like stars.

After a thousand years of the Former Day. After a thousand years of the Middle Day. At the BEGINNING of the Latter Day—**there would be three types of enemies of the Lotus Sutra.**

This was determined by eighty ten thousand million nayuta bodhisattvas.

**Could it be false?**

We are now more than 2,200 years after the Buddha's passing.

---

#### The Predictions Came True

The Buddha predicted: "In the thousand years of the Former Day after my passing, twenty-four people will propagate my correct Law in succession."

Setting aside Kashyapa and Ananda:
- Bhikṣu Pārśva at 100 years
- Aśvaghoṣa at 600 years
- Nāgārjuna at 700 years

**Not one error.** They all appeared exactly as predicted.

---

#### The Three Types of Powerful Enemies

Based on Chapter 13, there are three types:

1. **Ignorant lay people** — They curse and speak ill
2. **Arrogant priests** — Monks with twisted wisdom, claiming attainments they don't have
3. **False sages revered by the nation** — The worst kind. They LOOK holy. The authorities trust them. And they poison everything.

All three types surround me right now.

---

#### My Threefold Vow

**I will be the PILLAR of Japan.**  
**I will be the EYES of Japan.**  
**I will be the GREAT SHIP of Japan.**

These vows I have made—**let them not be broken!**

---


### Section 9: I Will Not Waver (Pages 107-121)

#### Breaking Down the Three Enemies

Let me break down the three types of powerful enemies for you.

**Type One: Arrogant Lay People**

These are the ordinary folks who don't understand doctrine but follow the crowd. When the government says "persecute," they persecute. When the mob says "curse," they curse. They don't know WHY they hate the Lotus practitioner—they just do.

**Type Two: Arrogant Monks**

These are the clergy who claim spiritual attainments they don't have. Their wisdom is twisted. Their hearts are fawning and crooked. They seek political power, not truth. They're the priests of the established schools who tell the authorities what they want to hear.

**Type Three: False Sages Revered by the Nation**

These are the MOST dangerous.

They LOOK holy. The authorities trust them. The people revere them. But they're poison.

Nichiren names names: Hōnen of Pure Land. The Zen masters. Kōbō of Shingon. The Ritsu reformers.

These are the ones who turned Japan against the Lotus Sutra. They're the reason for the disasters—the famines, the earthquakes, the Mongol threat.

All three types surround me right now.

---

#### Why Haven't the Protectors Come?

I keep asking myself: If I'm really the practitioner of the Lotus Sutra, why haven't the gods and protectors rescued me?

Here's what I've figured out. There are three possibilities:

**One:** Maybe the gods exist but have lost their power. The nation has abandoned the correct Law, so the gods are weakened.

**Two:** Maybe the gods have LEFT Japan entirely. The slander of the Law is so bad that they can't stomach it anymore.

**Three:** Maybe the protectors ARE coming—but they're letting the persecution intensify on purpose. By letting me suffer, they're increasing my merit. By letting my enemies attack me, they're accelerating those enemies' reverse connection to the Dharma.

I accept all three possibilities. The workings of karma are beyond ordinary understanding.

---

#### Am I Wrong?

I've asked myself this too.

Am I in error? Have I misunderstood the Dharma? Should I have been gentler? Should I have compromised?

I've examined myself thoroughly. I've reviewed the sutras again and again.

And here's my answer:

**Even if it costs me my life, I will not waver.**

The Lotus Sutra is the Buddha's true intention. Everything else is provisional. To compromise for personal safety would be to betray the Buddha, betray my parents who gave me life, and betray every living being in Japan.

I will not do it.

---

#### To My Disciples

Let me speak directly to those who follow me.

You who have stayed with me through exile and persecution—we are connected by karma from past lives. Even if you were to abandon me now, that connection can never be severed.

**Don't give in to fear.**

**Don't waver in your faith.**

Here's the logic: If the Lotus Sutra is TRUE—and it is—then those who uphold it WILL attain Buddhahood. If the Lotus Sutra were FALSE—which it isn't—then even slandering it would have no consequences.

But because it IS true, both faith and slander have real consequences. So choose wisely.

---

#### What "Opening the Eyes" Means

This treatise is called *Kaimoku Shō*—"On Opening the Eyes."

Here's what I've opened your eyes to:

**1. The True Buddha**  
Not the historical Shakyamuni who sat under the bodhi tree forty-odd years ago. The Eternal Buddha who has been enlightened since before any beginning.

**2. The True Teaching**  
Not the provisional sutras that denied Buddhahood to the two vehicles. The Lotus Sutra that reveals the One Buddha Vehicle for everyone.

**3. The True Practice for the Latter Day**  
Not meditation. Not esoteric ritual. Embracing and propagating the Lotus Sutra—even when it brings persecution.

**4. The True Votary**  
Me. Nichiren. The one who fulfills the prophecies and embodies the Bodhisattvas from the Earth.

---

#### My Final Word

If you want to know the truth—**open your eyes.**

If you're looking for the Buddha, don't look at images of gold or wood. Look at the practitioner who upholds the Lotus Sutra in the Latter Day.

If you're looking for the Dharma, don't wade through the eighty thousand teachings. Look at *Myōhō Renge Kyō*—the Wonderful Law Lotus Flower Sutra.

If you're looking for guidance, don't trust the arrogant monks and false sages. Look at the one who has endured exactly what the sutra predicted.

---

#### The Vow That Cannot Be Broken

**I will be the PILLAR of Japan.**  
**I will be the EYES of Japan.**  
**I will be the GREAT SHIP of Japan.**

Even if the heavens fall.  
Even if the earth splits open.  
Even if my life is forfeit.

**These vows I will not abandon.**

# Theological Endnotes

#### Chapter 1 Theological Notes

- **The Three Virtues Framework:** Nichiren establishes that sovereign, teacher, and parent are the three objects of devotion—and he will argue that the Buddha (and ultimately the Lotus Sutra) embodies all three.

- **The Critique of Confucianism:** While respectful, Nichiren's point is clear: Confucian wisdom is *temporal*—it governs this life but cannot save you in the next. It's the front porch, not the house.

- **The Critique of Non-Buddhist Paths:** Even deeper meditation and more extreme practices lead nowhere if they don't break through fundamental ignorance. The highest heaven is still a trapdoor to hell.

- **The Buddha's Uniqueness:** Only the Buddha has truly escaped birth and death. Only his words span past, present, and future. This sets up Nichiren's later argument that only the *Lotus Sutra* contains the Buddha's ultimate truth.

---


---

#### Chapter 2 Theological Notes

2

- **The Lotus Sutra's Unique Status:** Nichiren establishes that the Lotus is the ONLY sutra where the Buddha spoke his full truth. The earlier forty-plus years were preparation—"not yet the truth."

- **Ichinen Sanzen (Three Thousand Realms):** This is THE core doctrine, and Nichiren is emphatic that it was *stolen* by other schools who now claim it as their own. The intellectual theft becomes a moral crime.

- **The Problem of the Two Vehicles:** The earlier sutras say voice-hearers and cause-awakened ones can NEVER become Buddhas. The Lotus reverses this. This is Nichiren's first "great difference."

- **The Pattern of Corruption:** Schools steal from the Dharma, then claim superiority. This will be a recurring theme—Nichiren sees it happening in his own time with Zen and Pure Land.

- **Gratitude as Foundation:** Even in a fierce doctrinal polemic, Nichiren grounds everything in the ethical imperative of knowing and repaying debts. The Dharma failure is also a *moral* failure.

---


---

#### Chapter 3 Theological Notes

3

- **The Paradox of Evil and Good:** Nichiren drives home the point that the earlier sutras make the two vehicles' spiritual attainments *worse* than ordinary people's sins. This is not moral relativism—it's a statement about the tragedy of cutting off one's own Buddha-seed.

- **The Great Contradiction:** The rhetorical power of this section is immense. Nichiren forces the reader to feel the IMPOSSIBILITY of the Lotus Sutra's claims—and then shows how the cosmic testimony (Treasure Tower, emanation Buddhas) was needed precisely BECAUSE of the impossible reversal.

- **First vs. Eternal Enlightenment:** The setup for the Life Span chapter is now complete. Every sutra—even the theoretical teaching of the Lotus—maintains the "first enlightenment" position. The revelation in the essential teaching (Chapter 16) will overturn everything.

- **Nichiren's Self-Identification:** Quietly but firmly, Nichiren positions himself as the one who truly reads the Lotus—in the company of Dengyō alone across seven centuries.

---


---

#### Chapter 4 Theological Notes

4

- **Original Cause and Original Effect (本因本果):** This is the technical term for the doctrine revealed in the Life Span chapter—that the Buddha's practice (cause) and enlightenment (effect) exist from the beginningless past. This overturns the entire framework of "historical Buddha" spirituality.

- **The Moon Metaphor:** Tiantai's metaphor is brilliant: all the Buddhas of other sutras are like reflections of the moon in various bodies of water. The Life Span chapter reveals the actual moon in the sky. Other schools grab at the reflection.

- **Nichiren's Strategic Honesty:** Nichiren admits the difficulty of his position—the pre-Lotus sutras SEEM stronger because they're larger, longer, more numerous. This is not a weakness; it's a rhetorical setup. The obvious weakness of his position (two chapters vs. thousands of sutras) becomes proof of its truth: only the essential teaching makes this specific, revolutionary claim.

- **Hossō and Kegon/Shingon Arguments:** Nichiren gives his opponents their best possible arguments. This is classic debate technique—strengthen your opponent, then defeat them on their strongest ground.

- **The Final Challenge:** Nichiren's question—"In what sutra, in what fascicle, is the Buddha's eternal enlightenment taught?"—sets up his refutation. No other sutra makes this specific claim.

---


---

#### Chapter 5 Theological Notes

5

- **"The Sutra Text Matches My Body":** This is Nichiren's most personal declaration. He doesn't just believe the Lotus Sutra—he IS living proof of its predictions. His persecutions are not random misfortune; they are prophecy fulfilled.

- **The Persecution Prophecies (Chapter 13):** Nichiren quotes extensively from the "Encouraging Devotion" chapter, where twenty thousand bodhisattvas vow to propagate the Lotus Sutra despite the persecutions they will face. Nichiren sees himself as fulfilling their vow.

- **"Vow That Combines with Karma":** This is a bodhisattva's willingness to suffer deliberately in order to share the burden of others. Nichiren reframes his exile and attacks as a kind of salvific labor.

- **The Moon Metaphor Again:** Tiantai's image returns—the pre-Lotus teachings are reflections, not the reality. Nichiren uses this to explain why the earlier predictions for bodhisattvas were "deep but not truly deep."

- **The Meaning of the Daimoku:** Nichiren begins to explain the title *Myōhō Renge Kyō*. This will become central to his theology—the title itself embodies the entire teaching.

---


---

#### Chapter 6 Theological Notes

6

- **Transition to Part Two:** This section closes the Upper Volume (*Jō*) of the *Kaimoku Shō*. The Lower Volume (*Ge*) will shift from doctrinal argumentation to personal testimony and the identification of the Three Great Secret Laws.

- **The Title as Complete Teaching:** Nichiren's analysis of *Myōhō Renge Kyō* is not casual. For him, the title itself IS the teaching. Chanting *Nam-myōhō-renge-kyō* is not a summary of the sutra—it IS the sutra in its most concentrated form.

- **Mutual Possession of the Ten Worlds:** This is the doctrinal foundation for *ichinen sanzen* (three thousand realms in a single moment of life). If hell contains Buddhahood and Buddhahood contains hell, then transformation is always possible in ANY moment.

- **Structure Parallel to the Lotus Sutra:** The *Kaimoku Shō* is structured like the Lotus itself: the Upper Volume (like the Theoretical Teaching) establishes the doctrine; the Lower Volume (like the Essential Teaching) reveals the practitioner who embodies it.

---


---

# PART TWO: KAIMOKU SHŌ — LOWER VOLUME (開目抄下)

---

#### Chapter 7 Theological Notes

7

- **The Original Disciples from the Earth:** These bodhisattvas—Superior Practices, Boundless Practices, Pure Practices, Firmly Established Practices—are the true disciples of the eternal Buddha. They were taught in the remote past, not during Shakyamuni's historical lifetime. Nichiren will later identify himself with Superior Practices.

- **All Buddhas Are Emanations of Shakyamuni:** This is a radical repositioning. Every Buddha in every tradition—including Mahāvairocana of Shingon—is revealed to be a manifestation of the eternal Shakyamuni. This is Nichiren's most aggressive sectarian claim.

- **The Question of Proof:** Nichiren's agonizing question—"Is Nichiren NOT a practitioner?"—is not rhetorical. He is genuinely wrestling with why the protective deities haven't rescued him from exile and persecution. This will become central to the *Kaimoku Shō*'s conclusion.

- **Dengyō and Nichiren:** Nichiren places himself in a lineage of exactly two people in Japanese history who have truly taught the Lotus Sutra. This is an extraordinary self-identification.

---


---

#### Chapter 8 Theological Notes

8

- **"His head was struck off":** The Tatsunokuchi persecution of September 12, 1271 is THE pivotal event in Nichiren's life. According to tradition, a miraculous light stopped the execution at the last moment. Nichiren interprets this as a spiritual death and rebirth—his "previous self" dies, and he is reborn as the true votary of the Lotus Sutra.

- **The Three Types of Enemies:** Nichiren reads the "Encouraging Devotion" chapter as a prophecy fulfilled in his own lifetime. The third type—"false sages revered by the nation"—is the most dangerous, as it includes figures like Hōnen (Pure Land) and Kōbō (Shingon) whose teachings Nichiren sees as actively destroying Japan.

- **The Threefold Vow:** This is Nichiren's self-definition. He is not merely a scholar or a monk—he is Japan's spiritual foundation (pillar), its capacity to see truth (eyes), and its vehicle for collective salvation (great ship). This is the climax of his self-identification as the practitioner of the Lotus Sutra for the Latter Day.

- **The Keepsake:** Nichiren frames the *Kaimoku Shō* itself as a sacred document—a "bright mirror" reflecting the Buddha's prophecy. He expects to die in exile; this treatise is his legacy.

---


---

#### Chapter 9 Theological Notes

9

- **The Three Types in Nichiren's Japan:** Nichiren isn't speaking abstractly. He identifies the common people who followed the Kamakura government's persecution, the established clergy of the Nara and Kyoto schools, and specific named leaders—Hōnen, the Zen masters, Kōbō—as the three enemies.

- **Three Answers About the Protectors:** Nichiren's willingness to consider multiple theological explanations shows his sophistication. He's not defensive or simplistic—he integrates the question into a larger understanding of karma.

- **"I Will Not Waver":** This is the emotional and theological climax of the document. Written in exile, expecting death, Nichiren plants his flag. This is his final answer.

- **The Four Revelations:** The "opening of eyes" refers to four interconnected insights: the true Buddha, the true teaching, the true practice, and the true votary. Together, these constitute Nichiren's revolutionary reframing of Buddhist tradition.

- **The Threefold Vow (Repeated):** By ending with the threefold vow, Nichiren frames his entire treatise as a declaration of commitment. The *Kaimoku Shō* is not just doctrine—it's a vow.
