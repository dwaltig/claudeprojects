## Part One: The Upper Volume (開目抄上)

### Section 1: The Three Virtues and the Three Teachings (Pages 50-53)

#### The Three Objects of Devotion

Now then, there are three things that all living beings should revere: the sovereign, the teacher, and the parent.¹ Likewise, there are three teachings that should be studied: Confucianism, non-Buddhist teachings, and Buddhism.²

---

#### I. Confucianism and the Limits of Secular Wisdom

**The Chinese Sages**

In Confucianism, the Three Sovereigns, the Five Emperors, and the Three Kings³ are called "Heavenly Honored Ones." They are the heads of all ministers and the bridges for all people. Before the Three Sovereigns, people did not know their fathers—they were no different from birds and beasts. After the Five Emperors, people came to distinguish their parents and practiced filial piety.

Thus, Chong Hua⁴ showed respect even to his obstinate father. Pei Gong,⁵ upon becoming emperor, still paid homage to his father Tai Gong. King Wu made a wooden image of his father Xi Bo.⁶ Ding Lan carved an image of his mother.⁷ These are the exemplars of filial piety.

**Exemplars of Loyalty**

Bi Gan,⁸ seeing that the Yin dynasty was about to perish, remonstrated with the emperor despite the danger and was beheaded. Hong Yan,⁹ a certain retainer, cut open his own belly, placed Duke Yi's liver within it, and died. These are the exemplars of loyalty.

**The Four Sages**

Yin Shou was the teacher of King Yao. Wu Cheng was the teacher of King Shun. Tai Gong Wang was the teacher of King Wen. Laozi was the teacher of Confucius. These four are called the Four Sages.¹⁰ The Heavenly Honored Ones bowed their heads to them, and all the people joined their palms in reverence.

**The Three Mysteries**

These sages produced over three thousand volumes of texts, including the *Three Graves*, the *Five Classics*, and the *Three Histories*.¹¹ Yet the essence of all these teachings does not go beyond the Three Mysteries (*san-xuan*):

1. **The Mystery of Being** — established by the Duke of Zhou and others
2. **The Mystery of Non-Being** — expounded by Laozi and others  
3. **The Mystery of Both Being and Non-Being** — the mystery of Zhuangzi

*Xuan* (玄) means "dark" or "profound." When one inquires into the time before father and mother were born, some say that one arises from the primal energy (*yuan-qi*); others say that distinctions such as high and low, suffering and joy, right and wrong, gain and loss—all arise spontaneously and naturally.

---

#### The Fundamental Limitation of Confucianism

Although these teachings are cleverly constructed, they do not know even a fraction of the past or the future. *Xuan* means "dark" and "hidden"—that is why it is called *xuan*. They seem to understand only the present.

In the present, they regulate benevolence and righteousness to protect the body and bring peace to the nation. Those who violate these principles, they say, will destroy their clans and ruin their houses. These worthies and sages, though called "sages," do not know the past—like an ordinary person who cannot see their own back. They do not mirror the future—like a blind person who cannot see what is before them.

If one merely governs one's household in the present, practices filial piety, and firmly upholds the Five Constants,¹² then colleagues will show respect, one's name will be known throughout the country, wise kings will summon such a person—making them a minister, relying on them as a teacher, or even ceding the throne to them. Even heaven will come to protect and serve them. Thus, when King Wu of Zhou ruled, the Five Elders came to serve him. When Guangwu of the Later Han reigned, the Twenty-Eight Lodges descended and became his twenty-eight generals.¹³

**Nevertheless**, because they do not know the past and future, they cannot save their parents, sovereigns, or teachers in their future lives. They are persons who do not know gratitude. They are not true sages or worthies.

---

#### Confucius Points to the Buddha

Confucius himself said: "In this land there are no sages or worthies. In the west there is one called Buddha. He is a true sage."¹⁴ Thus he made the outer teachings (Confucianism) the gateway to the Buddha's Law.

He taught rites and music so that when the inner teachings (Buddhism) arrived, people would more easily understand the precepts, concentration, and wisdom. He taught kings and ministers to establish distinctions of high and low. He taught about parents so that people would know the loftiness of filial piety. He taught about teachers so that people would understand devotion.

The Great Master Miaole¹⁵ said: "The spread of Buddhism truly depends upon this. Rites and music go before it, and the true Way opens up afterward."

The Great Master Tiantai¹⁶ said, quoting the *Golden Light Sutra*: "All the excellent teachings in the world all derive from this sutra. If one deeply understands worldly law, that is itself the Buddha's Law."

And in the *Great Concentration and Insight*, it says: "I dispatched three sages to transform that land of China."¹⁷

---

#### II. The Non-Buddhist Teachings of India

**The Gods and the Three Seers**

The *Hongju*¹⁸ says, quoting the *Sutra of Pure Conduct*: "The Bodhisattva Moonlight is called Yan Hui there. The Bodhisattva Pure Light is called Confucius (Zhongni) there. The Bodhisattva Kāśyapa is called Laozi there." "There" refers to China, as seen from India.

Second are the non-Buddhist teachings of India. Maheshvara (the three-eyed, eight-armed deity)¹⁹ and Vishnu²⁰—these two gods are called the compassionate father and merciful mother of all living beings, and also Heavenly Honored Ones and sovereigns. Kapila, Ulūka, and Ṛṣabha²¹—these three are called the Three Seers. They were seers who lived eight hundred years before and after the Buddha's appearance.

**The Four Vedas and Ninety-Five Schools**

The teachings of these Three Seers are called the Four Vedas,²² comprising sixty thousand volumes. At the time of the Buddha's appearance, the Six Non-Buddhist Teachers²³ studied and transmitted these scriptures and became teachers to the kings of the five regions of India. Their branch schools multiplied into ninety-five or ninety-six sects. Each school had many sub-branches. Their banners of arrogance rose higher than the Heaven of Neither Perception Nor Non-Perception. Their tenacious attachments were harder than metal or stone. The profundity and ingenuity of their views were incomparable to those of the Confucians.

Some could see two, three, or even seven past lives, or illuminate eighty thousand kalpas of the past. Some could also know eighty thousand kalpas of the future. The ultimate principles of their teachings were: "The effect exists within the cause." Or: "The effect does not exist within the cause." Or: "The effect both exists and does not exist within the cause." These are the ultimate principles of the non-Buddhist teachings.

**Their Practices and Their Failure**

The good non-Buddhists upheld the five precepts and the ten good precepts, cultivated defiled meditation, and ascended to the realms of form and formlessness. They regarded the higher realms as nirvana and climbed upward like inchworms. Yet from the Heaven of Neither Perception Nor Non-Perception, they fell back into the three evil paths. Not one of them remained in heaven. Nevertheless, those who reached the highest heavens believed they would never return.

Because they firmly adhered to the doctrines of their own teachers, some bathed three times daily in the Ganges even in the bitter cold of winter. Some pulled out their hair. Some threw themselves against cliffs. Some burned their bodies in fire. Some branded the five places on their bodies. Some went naked. Some believed that killing many horses would bring good fortune. Some burned grasses and trees. Some worshipped all trees. The number of such erroneous doctrines is beyond counting.

---

#### The Ultimate Failure of Non-Buddhist Paths

They revered their teachers as the gods revere Indra and as ministers prostrate before the emperor. Yet among the ninety-five types of non-Buddhist teachings, whether their practices were good or evil, not a single person escaped the cycle of birth and death.

Those who served good teachers fell into the evil paths after two or three lifetimes. Those who served evil teachers fell into the evil paths in their very next life.

**The essential point** of the non-Buddhist teachings is that one must enter the inner way (Buddhism). Various non-Buddhists predicted: "After a thousand years, the Buddha will appear in the world." Others said: "After a hundred years."

The *Nirvana Sutra* states: "All the scriptures of the non-Buddhists in the world are all the Buddha's teachings and not the teachings of non-Buddhists."²⁴

The *Lotus Sutra* states: "They show themselves as having the three poisons and manifest the appearance of erroneous views. In this way, my disciples use expedient means to save living beings."²⁵

---

#### III. The Buddha: The True Teacher

Third is the Great Awakened World-Honored One. He is the great guide, the great eye, the great bridge, the great ship-master, and the great field of merit²⁶ for all living beings.

The Four Sages of the outer teachings and the Three Seers of the non-Buddhist teachings—though called "sages," in reality they are ordinary mortals who have not yet severed the three categories of illusion.²⁷ Though called "worthies," in reality they do not understand cause and effect—they are like infants. Can one cross the great sea of birth and death by using them as a ship? Can one traverse the crossroads of the six paths by using them as a bridge? It is difficult indeed.

But our Great Teacher has already crossed even the transformation-body birth and death.²⁸ How much more so the birth and death of the physical body! He has already overturned the fundamental darkness of primal ignorance. How much more so the branches and leaves of coarse illusions like views and thoughts!

**The Buddha's Fifty Years of Teaching**

This Buddha, from his attainment of the Way at age thirty until his entry into nirvana at age eighty—for these fifty years—expounded the sacred teachings of his lifetime. Every word and phrase is a true teaching. Every sentence and verse is without falsehood.

Even the words of the sages and worthies among the outer teachings and non-Buddhist paths are not mistaken—their actions and intentions accord with each other. How much more so the Buddha, who has been a person who does not speak falsehood for immeasurable kalpas! Therefore, the teachings of his fifty-plus years, when compared to the outer teachings and non-Buddhist paths, are the Great Vehicle—the true words of a great person.

From the beginning of his attainment of the Way to his entry into nirvana at dusk—everything he taught is true.

### Section 2: The Supremacy of the Lotus Sutra (Pages 54-58)

#### The Buddha's Teachings Contain Many Levels

However, when we examine the fifty-plus years of the Buddha's teachings within Buddhism—the eighty thousand treasuries of the Law—we find that there are Hinayana and Mahayana, provisional sutras and true sutras. There are exoteric and esoteric teachings, gentle words and harsh words, true words and false words, correct views and wrong views—various distinctions of this kind.

**Only the Lotus Sutra is the correct teaching of the Buddha Shakyamuni.** Only the Lotus Sutra is the true word of the Buddhas of the ten directions and three existences.

The Great Awakened World-Honored One pointed to the period of more than forty years and, regarding all the sutras as numerous as the sands of the Ganges within that period, declared: "I have not yet revealed the truth."¹ Regarding the eight years of the Lotus Sutra, he determined: "Now I must certainly preach the truth."²

Thereupon, the Buddha Many Treasures emerged from the earth and testified: "All that you have said is true."³ The emanation Buddhas gathered from the ten directions and extended their long tongues to the Brahma heaven.⁴

These declarations are bright and brilliant! They are clearer than the sun in a cloudless sky, brighter than the full moon at midnight. Look up and believe! Bow your head and reflect!

---

#### The Two Great Matters of the Lotus Sutra

This sutra contains two great matters.⁵ The Kusha, Jōjitsu, Ritsu, Hossō, and Sanron schools do not even know their names. The Kegon and Shingon schools secretly stole them and made them the core of their own doctrines.

**The doctrine of three thousand realms in a single moment of life⁶** is sunk in the depths of the "Life Span" chapter of the essential teaching of the Lotus Sutra. Nāgārjuna and Vasubandhu perceived it but did not bring it forth. Only our Great Master Tiantai embraced and revealed it.

---

#### The Origin of Ichinen Sanzen

Three thousand realms in a single moment of life begins with the mutual possession of the Ten Worlds.⁷ The Hossō and Sanron schools establish eight worlds but do not know the Ten Worlds—how much less the mutual possession! The Kusha, Jōjitsu, and Ritsu schools, based on the Āgama sutras, illuminate only six worlds and do not know the four higher worlds.

They say "There is only one Buddha in the ten directions" but do not even clarify "There is a Buddha in each direction." They certainly do not teach "All sentient beings possess the Buddha nature." They do not even allow that a single person has Buddha nature.

When the Ritsu and Jōjitsu schools speak of "Buddhas in the ten directions" and "Buddha nature," this is because teachers after the Buddha's passing stole Mahayana doctrines and incorporated them into their own schools.

---

#### The Pattern of Corruption

**This is similar to the non-Buddhist teachings.** Non-Buddhists before the Buddha's time had shallow attachments to their views. But non-Buddhists after the Buddha, having heard Buddhism and recognized the failings of their own doctrines, developed cunning minds. They stole Buddhist teachings and incorporated them into their own, making their wrong views even more profound. This is called "attaching oneself to Buddhism" and "learning the Buddhist Law to achieve one's own ends."

The outer teachings were the same. Before Buddhism reached China, the Confucianists and Taoists were gentle and naive, like infants. But after Buddhism arrived in the Later Han period and debates took place, as Buddhism gradually spread, some Buddhist monks broke the precepts. Some returned to lay life, and some aligned themselves with secular views. They smuggled Buddhist doctrines into Confucianism and Taoism.

The *Great Concentration and Insight*, fascicle five, states: "In the present age there are many evil demon-monks who abandon the precepts and return to lay life. Fearing discipline, they become Taoists instead. Or, seeking fame and profit, they boast of Zhuangzi and Laozi, steal the meanings of Buddhism and place them in heretical texts, pressing down what is high to make it low, crushing what is honorable to make it base, treating all as equal."⁸

The *Annotations* states: "As monks, they destroy Buddhism. Those who 'abandon the precepts and return to lay life' are like Wei Yuansong and others. They become lay people and destroy Buddhism. These people steal the correct teaching and add it to heretical texts. 'Pressing down what is high' means using the Taoist mind as the standard for both teachings, making wrong and right equal. There is no principle in this. Having once entered Buddhism, they steal the correct and help the wrong, pressing down the loftiness of the eighty thousand and twelve⁹ to the lowness of the five thousand and two texts,¹⁰ using them to interpret the base teachings of those texts. This is called 'crushing what is honorable to make it base.'"

---

#### The Rise and Fall of Buddhist Schools in China

**Buddhism followed the same pattern.** After Buddhism reached China in the Yongping era of the Later Han,¹¹ the heretical texts were refuted and the inner texts established. Within the inner texts, different views arose—the "three of the South and seven of the North"¹² debated like orchids and chrysanthemums competing in beauty. But they were all defeated by the Great Master Zhiyi (Tiantai) of the Chen and Sui dynasties, and Buddhism again saved the multitudes.

Afterward, the Hossō and Shingon schools came from India, and the Kegon school also arose. Among these schools, the Hossō school was a consistent enemy of the Tendai school—their doctrines were like fire and water. Nevertheless, when Xuanzang Tripitaka Master and the Great Master Cien¹³ carefully examined Tiantai's commentaries, they seem to have mentally submitted to Tiantai, even though they did not abandon their own school, because their wrong views were being overturned.

---

#### The Theft of Ichinen Sanzen

**The Kegon and Shingon schools were originally based on provisional sutras and were provisional schools.** The Tripitaka Masters Shubhakarasiṃha and Vajrabodhi¹⁴ stole the doctrine of three thousand realms in a single moment of life from Tiantai, made it the core of their own school, and added mudrās and mantras on top of it, developing the attitude that they surpassed Tiantai.

Scholars who do not know these details think: "The doctrine of three thousand realms came from India in the *Mahāvairocana Sutra*." But they are wrong.

The Kegon school, in Chengguan's time,¹⁵ stole Tiantai's doctrine of three thousand realms in a single moment of life and inserted it into the Kegon passage "The mind is like a skilled painter."¹⁶ People do not know this.

---

#### Dengyō Defeats the Six Schools

**In Japan, our country, the six schools such as Kegon arrived before Tendai and Shingon.** The Kegon, Sanron, and Hossō schools disputed like fire and water. Then the Great Master Dengyō¹⁷ appeared in this country and not only refuted the wrong views of the six schools but also exposed how the Shingon school had stolen the principle of the Lotus Sutra from Tendai and made it the ultimate of their own school.

The Great Master Dengyō abandoned the different attachments of the teachers of the various schools and refuted them solely on the basis of the sutra texts. The high priests of the six schools—eight people, twelve people, fourteen people, over three hundred people¹⁸—as well as Kōbō Daishi¹⁹ were all defeated. Without exception, everyone in Japan submitted to the Tendai school. The great temples of the Southern Capital,²⁰ Tō-ji, and all the mountain temples throughout Japan became branch temples of Mount Hiei. It was also revealed that the founders of the various schools in China had escaped the error of slandering the Law by submitting to Tiantai.

---

#### The Decline of True Buddhism

**Afterward, as the world gradually declined and people's wisdom grew shallow,** the profound meaning of Tendai was lost through lack of study. As the attachments of the other schools grew stronger, Tendai was gradually pressed down by the six and seven schools and grew weaker. In the end, it was surpassed even by the worthless Zen and Pure Land schools.²¹

At first, lay patrons gradually shifted to those wrong schools. In the end, even the eminent priests who were revered as the great teachers of Tendai fell away and helped those wrong schools. As a result, the rice paddies and estates of the six and eight schools were all taken away, and the correct Law was completely lost.

The great protective deities—Tenshō Daijin, Shōhachiman, Sannō, and others—either could no longer taste the flavor of the Law or departed from the country. Therefore, evil demons gained entry, and the country is now on the verge of ruin.

#### The Two Great Differences: Two Vehicles Attaining Buddhahood and the Revelation of the Buddha's Eternal Life

Here I, with my foolish views, have examined the differences between the first more-than-forty years and the later eight years. Though the differences are many, the first things that scholars of the world accept and that I myself find convincing are **the attainment of Buddhahood by the Two Vehicles** and **the revelation of the Buddha's original enlightenment in the remote past**.²²

---

#### The Predictions in the Lotus Sutra

When we reverently examine the actual text of the Lotus Sutra, we find:
- Shariputra will become the Thus Come One Flower Glow
- Kashyapa will become the Thus Come One Light Bright
- Subhuti will become the Thus Come One Rare Form
- Katyayana will become the Thus Come One Jāmbūnada Gold Light
- Maudgalyayana will become the Thus Come One Tamālapattra Sandalwood Fragrance Buddha
- Purna will become the Thus Come One Law Bright
- Ananda will become the Thus Come One Mountain Sea Wisdom Unrestricted Power King Buddha
- Rāhula will become the Thus Come One Treading Seven Treasure Flowers
- The five hundred and seven hundred disciples will become Buddhas called Universal Brightness
- The two thousand voice-hearers in training and no longer in training will become the Thus Come One Jewel Form
- Mahāprajāpatī Bhikshunī and Yashodharā Bhikshunī will become the Thus Come Ones Seen with Joy by All Living Beings and Endowed with a Thousand Ten Thousand Glowing Marks²³

When one reverently reads the Lotus Sutra, these people appear honored and noble. But when one opens the earlier sutras, one is greatly dismayed.

---

#### The Contradiction

The reason is this: The Buddha World-Honored One is a person of truthful words. Therefore he is called a sage and a great person. Even the worthies, sages, and heavenly immortals of the outer teachings and non-Buddhist paths are so named because of their truthful words. Because he surpasses all these people and is foremost, the World-Honored One is called a great person.

This great person proclaimed: "The Thus Come One has appeared in the world for one great purpose alone."²⁴ He declared: "I have not yet revealed the truth." And: "The World-Honored One, having long expounded his doctrines, must certainly now proclaim the truth."²⁵ And: "Honestly discarding expedient means."²⁶

The Buddha Many Treasures added his testimony, and the emanation Buddhas extended their tongues. Given these assurances, who could doubt the future predictions that Shariputra will become the Thus Come One Flower Glow, that Kashyapa will become the Thus Come One Light Bright?

---

#### The Pre-Lotus Sutras Also Seem True

**However, the earlier sutras are also the truthful words of the Buddha.**

The *Flower Garland Sutra* states: "The Thus Come One's wisdom, the great medicine king tree, can benefit all places except two: those who have fallen into the great pit of the vast nothingness of the two vehicles, and the sentient beings of nonvirtue who have destroyed their roots of goodness and are submerged in the water of great wrong views and covetous attachment."²⁷

The meaning of this sutra passage is this: In the Snow Mountains there is a great tree called Inexhaustible Roots. It is called the Great Medicine King Tree. It is the king of all trees in Jambudvīpa. This tree is 168,000 yojanas tall. All the grasses and trees of Jambudvīpa follow the sequence of this tree's roots, branches, leaves, flowers, and fruits in producing their own flowers and fruits. This tree is compared to the Buddha's Buddha nature. All sentient beings are compared to all the grasses and trees.

However, this great tree does not grow in a pit of fire or in the midst of water. The minds of the two vehicles are compared to a pit of fire. The minds of icchantikas are compared to water. These two types, the sutra is saying, can never become Buddhas.

---

#### The Condemnation of the Two Vehicles

The *Great Collection Sutra* states: "There are two types of people who will surely die and not live, who will ultimately be unable to know or repay their debts of gratitude. They are the voice-hearers and the cause-awakened ones. It is like a person who has fallen into a deep pit and cannot benefit himself or others. The voice-hearers and cause-awakened ones are the same. Having fallen into the pit of liberation, they cannot benefit themselves or others."²⁸

---

#### Gratitude as the Foundation

**The essential point of the more than three thousand volumes of the outer texts is two things: filial piety and loyalty.** Loyalty itself emerges from the house of filial piety.

*Filial* (孝, *kō*) means *high* (高, *kō*). The heavens are high, but they are not higher than filial piety.  
*Filial* also means *profound* (厚, *kō*). The earth is profound, but it is not more profound than filial piety.

The two types—sages and worthies—emerge from the house of filial piety. How much more should those who study the Buddha's Law have gratitude and repay that gratitude! The disciples of the Buddha must know the four debts of gratitude²⁹ and practice knowing gratitude and repaying gratitude.

---


### Section 3: The Condemnation of the Two Vehicles and the Great Contradiction (Pages 59-65)

#### The Two Vehicles Become Ungrateful

Moreover, the voice-hearers such as Shariputra and Kashyapa, having kept the two hundred and fifty precepts and the three thousand rules of conduct, enter the path of eternal non-attainment of Buddhahood. Thus they become persons who do not know gratitude.¹

---

#### The Vimalakirti Sutra's Condemnation

The *Vimalakirti Sutra* states: "Vimalakirti asked Manjushri, 'What is the seed of the Thus Come One?' Manjushri replied, 'All the afflictions and defilements are the seed of the Thus Come One. Even one who possesses the five cardinal sins² can still arouse the great aspiration for the Way.'"

It also states: "It is like this, sons of good families: the lotus flowers—blue, red, and white—do not grow on the high plateau or dry land. They grow in the low, muddy, foul fields."³

It also states: "One who has already attained arhatship and become a true saint can never again arouse the aspiration for the Way and obtain the Buddha's Law. A person whose faculties are destroyed cannot benefit from the five pleasures."⁴

The meaning of these passages is: the three poisons of greed, anger, and ignorance can become the seed of Buddhahood; the five cardinal sins such as killing one's father can become the seed of Buddhahood; the high plateau and dry land cannot produce the lotus flower; but the two vehicles can never become Buddhas.

---

#### The Paradox: Evil Surpasses Two-Vehicle Goodness

The implication is this: when we compare the various good deeds of the two vehicles with the evil deeds of ordinary people, the evil of ordinary people can lead to Buddhahood, but the good of the two vehicles cannot.

The various Hinayana sutras admonish evil and praise good. But this sutra criticizes the good of the two vehicles and praises the evil of ordinary people. It hardly seems like a Buddhist sutra—it is more like the teachings of the non-Buddhists. But the essential point is that the Buddha is forcefully establishing the eternal non-attainment of Buddhahood by the two vehicles.

---

#### The Dhāraṇī Sutra's Verdict

The *Fangdeng Tuoluoni Sutra*⁵ states: "Manjushri said to Shariputra, 'Is it the case that a withered tree can once again produce flowers? Is it the case that water that has flowed down a mountain can return to its source? Can a broken stone be joined together again? Can a burnt seed sprout again?' Shariputra replied, 'No.' Manjushri said, 'If these things are impossible, then why do you ask me about obtaining the prediction of bodhi with joy?'"

The meaning is: a withered tree cannot flower; water does not flow back up the mountain; a broken stone cannot be made whole; a burnt seed cannot sprout. The two vehicles are the same—their Buddha-seed has been burnt.

---

#### The Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra

The *Great Perfection of Wisdom Sutra* states: "O sons of heaven, those who have not yet aroused the aspiration for complete enlightenment should arouse it now. But if one enters the settled stage of the voice-hearers, this person cannot arouse the aspiration for complete enlightenment. Why? Because they have created an obstruction to birth and death."⁶

The meaning is: the Buddha does not rejoice in the two vehicles because they do not arouse the aspiration for enlightenment. The Buddha rejoices in the heavenly beings because they do arouse this aspiration.

---

#### The Shūraṅgama Sutra

The *Shūraṅgama Sutra* states: "A person who has committed the five cardinal sins, upon hearing this Shūraṅgama samādhi and arousing the aspiration for complete enlightenment, can still become a Buddha. But World-Honored One, an arhat who has exhausted all outflows is like a broken vessel—he can never endure receiving this samādhi."⁷

---

#### The Vimalakirti Sutra's Harshest Words

The *Vimalakirti Sutra* states: "One who gives offerings to you does not plant a field of merit. One who makes offerings to you will fall into the three evil paths."⁸

The meaning is: the humans and heavenly beings who make offerings to the holy monks Kashyapa and Shariputra will certainly fall into the three evil paths.

---

#### The Humiliation of the Voice-Hearers

These holy monks, apart from the Buddha himself, were thought to be the eyes of humans and heavenly beings, the guides of all living beings. Yet in how many great assemblies of humans and heavenly beings did the Buddha speak these things time after time! What was his true intention?

Was he trying to shame his own disciples to death? Beyond these examples, there are countless other comparisons—cow's milk versus donkey's milk, earthen vessels versus gold vessels, fireflies versus sunlight—that the Buddha used to rebuke the two vehicles.

Not just one or two words. Not just one or two days. Not just one or two months. Not just one or two years. Not just one or two sutras. **For more than forty years**, in countless sutras, before countless great assemblies, he never said a single word of approval—only criticism.

Because the World-Honored One does not speak falsely, everyone knows this. I know it, other people know it, heaven knows it, earth knows it. Not just one or two people, but hundreds, thousands, millions of people. The heavenly beings of the three realms, the dragons, asuras, and the beings of the five regions of India and the four continents; the beings of the six heavens of desire, the form realm, and the formless realm; the humans, heavenly beings, voice-hearers, and great bodhisattvas who gathered from the ten directions—they all know this, they all heard this.

Each returned to their own lands and told of the preaching of Shakyamuni Buddha in the Sahā world. Thus, throughout the boundless worlds of the ten directions, every single being came to know that Kashyapa, Shariputra, and the others would never attain Buddhahood and that making offerings to them would lead to misfortune.

---

#### The Great Contradiction

**Given this situation**, when the Buddha in the final eight years of the Lotus Sutra suddenly reversed himself and taught that the two vehicles would attain Buddhahood, would the great assembly of humans and heavenly beings be able to believe it?

Not only would they refuse to accept it, but they would also come to doubt the sutras that came before and after. The fifty-plus years of teachings would all become false preaching.

If the passage "For more than forty years, I have not yet revealed the truth" is correct, then perhaps a heavenly demon has assumed the form of the Buddha and is preaching the eight-year sutra?

Just when this doubt was arising, the Buddha made specific predictions, naming the kalpas, the lands, and the names of the Buddhas that the two vehicles would become. He specified the disciples who would be converted. And so the words of the Buddha Shakyamuni became contradictory. This is what is called "self-contradiction."⁹ This is why the non-Buddhists laughed at the Buddha and called him a great liar.

---

#### The Treasure Tower Appears

The great assembly of humans and heavenly beings was stunned. At that exact moment, from the eastern direction, from the World of Treasure Purity, the Thus Come One Many Treasures came riding in a great seven-jeweled stupa, five hundred yojanas high and two hundred fifty yojanas wide.

The Buddha Shakyamuni was being pressed by the assembly about his self-contradiction. He tried explaining this way and that, giving all kinds of explanations, but the doubts showed no sign of being resolved. He seemed at a loss.

Then, before the Buddha, the great stupa emerged from the earth and rose into the sky. It was like the full moon rising from the eastern mountains on a dark night. The seven-jeweled stupa hung in the great sky, touching neither the earth below nor the heavens above, suspended in mid-air.

From within the treasure stupa, a voice like Brahma's thunder testified: "Excellent, excellent! Shakyamuni, World-Honored One, you are able to teach this Lotus Sutra of the Wonderful Law, which is the great and impartial wisdom, the Law that teaches the bodhisattvas and is protected and kept in mind by the Buddhas, to the great assembly. So it is, so it is! What Shakyamuni World-Honored One has taught is all true!"¹⁰

Furthermore: "At that time, the World-Honored One, before Manjushri and the countless hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of bodhisattvas who had long dwelt in the Sahā world, and the humans and nonhumans, manifested his great supernatural powers. He extended his long, broad tongue upward to the Brahma heaven, and from every pore emitted light... The Buddhas of the ten directions, seated on lion seats beneath jeweled trees, also extended their long, broad tongues and emitted immeasurable light."¹¹

---

#### Why the Lotus Sutra Is Different

At the time of the Buddha's initial enlightenment, the Buddhas appeared in the ten directions to comfort Shakyamuni and sent great bodhisattvas. At the time of the *Perfection of Wisdom Sutra*, Shakyamuni extended his tongue to cover the great thousand worlds, and a thousand Buddhas appeared in the ten directions. In the *Golden Light Sutra*, four Buddhas appeared. In the *Amida Sutra*, the Buddhas of the six directions extended their tongues to cover the great thousand worlds. In the *Great Collection Sutra*, the Buddhas and bodhisattvas of the ten directions gathered in the Great Jeweled Pavilion.

When we compare these to the Lotus Sutra, it is like confusing yellow stones with gold, white clouds with white mountains, white ice with silver mirrors, or black with blue. Those with clouded eyes, one-eyed vision, or distorted vision may mistake them. But they are not the same.

---

#### The Other Sutras Had No Need for Such Drama

The *Flower Garland Sutra* was the first sutra, so there were no prior sutras to contradict—no great doubt could arise. The *Great Collection*, *Great Perfection of Wisdom*, *Golden Light*, and *Amida* sutras were expounded to rebuke the two vehicles as condemned in the Hinayana sutras, to proclaim the Pure Lands of the ten directions, and to inspire ordinary beings and bodhisattvas while troubling the two vehicles.

Because there was some contradiction between the Hinayana sutras and the various Mahayana sutras, the Buddhas appeared in the ten directions, great bodhisattvas were sent, the sutras were taught in the ten directions, the Buddhas gathered from the ten directions, Shakyamuni extended his tongue to cover the great thousand worlds, and the Buddhas extended their tongues.

This was simply to break the idea in the Hinayana sutras that "there is only one Buddha in the ten directions." It was not the great matter of the Lotus Sutra, where the prior and later Mahayana sutras contradicted each other, causing the voice-hearers, great bodhisattvas, and humans and heavenly beings to wonder: "Has the Buddha been possessed by a demon?"¹²

---

#### The Blindness of Other Schools

Yet the clouded-eyed followers of the Kegon, Hossō, Sanron, Shingon, and Nembutsu schools think that their sutras are the same as the Lotus Sutra. Their eyes are truly pathetic.

During the Buddha's lifetime, perhaps there were those who abandoned the more-than-forty years of teachings and followed the Lotus Sutra. But after the Buddha's passing, it is difficult to open and see these sutra passages and believe and accept them.

---

#### The Apparent Strength of the Earlier Sutras

First, the earlier sutras contain many words; the Lotus Sutra is brief. The earlier sutras are many sutras; this is one sutra. The earlier sutras span many years; this sutra is only eight years. If the Buddha is a great liar, he should never be believed. If one establishes belief on top of disbelief, one might believe the earlier sutras, but one should never believe the Lotus Sutra.

Even today, everyone seems to believe in the Lotus Sutra, but it is not really the Lotus Sutra they believe. Why? Because they willingly take refuge in those who teach that the Lotus Sutra and the *Mahāvairocana Sutra* are the same, that the Lotus and the *Flower Garland* are the same, that the Lotus and the *Amida Sutra* are the same—and they reject those who say these sutras are different. Even if they accept such people, they consider it unsatisfactory.

---

#### Nichiren's Declaration

I, Nichiren, declare: "In the more than seven hundred years since Buddhism came to Japan, only the Great Master Dengyō truly read the Lotus Sutra." But people refuse to accept this.

However, the Lotus Sutra states: "Even if one were to take Mount Sumeru and hurl it into the countless Buddha lands of the other direction, this would still not be difficult... But if, after the Buddha's passing, in an evil age, one can preach this sutra, that is truly difficult."¹³

My strong assertion accords with the sutra text. The *Nirvana Sutra*, which transmits the Lotus, says: "In the Latter Day of the Law, an age of slander, those who slander the Law will be like the soil of the ten directions, while those who uphold the correct Law will be like the soil on a fingernail."¹⁴

Are the people of Japan the soil on the fingernail, and Nichiren the soil of the ten directions? Consider this well.

In the era of a wise king, reason will prevail. In the era of a foolish ruler, unreason will prevail. In the era of a sage, the true meaning of the Lotus Sutra will be revealed.

---

#### The First Great Difference: Two Vehicles Attaining Buddhahood

This doctrine, when compared between the theoretical teaching and the earlier sutras, makes the earlier sutras seem stronger. If the earlier sutras are stronger, then all the voice-hearers such as Shariputra will never attain Buddhahood. How grieved they must be!

---

#### The Second Great Difference: The Revelation of the Buddha's Eternal Life

Second, the Buddha Shakyamuni was born in the ninth period of decrease of the kalpa of continuance, when the human lifespan was a hundred years. He was the grandson of King Simhahanu, the legitimate son of King Shuddhodana, the prince Siddhārtha, the bodhisattva All-Purpose Achievement.

He renounced the world at age nineteen and attained enlightenment at age thirty. At the very beginning, at the place of enlightenment, he manifested the ceremony of the Lotus Treasury World¹⁵ and expounded the great Law of the ten profound principles, the six characteristics, the perfect fusion of the dharma realm, and the sudden and ultimate subtlety. The Buddhas of the ten directions appeared, and all the bodhisattvas gathered like clouds.

Given the land, the assembly, the Buddhas, and the timing—what reason could there be for the Buddha to conceal the great Law? Therefore, the sutra text says: "He manifested his sovereign powers and expounded the complete sutra."¹⁶ The sixty fascicles of the *Flower Garland Sutra*, every word and dot, are a complete sutra.

It is like the wish-granting jewel: one jewel and countless jewels are the same; one jewel can rain down all treasures, and countless jewels can rain down all treasures. So too, the *Flower Garland Sutra* should be the same whether one word or ten thousand words.

The passage "Mind, Buddha, and living beings"¹⁷ is not only the core of the Kegon school but also the essential point of the Hossō, Sanron, Shingon, and Tendai schools.

---

#### The Flaw in the Flower Garland Sutra

Yet this magnificent sutra hides something: it teaches that "the two vehicles and the icchantikas cannot attain Buddhahood"—this seems like a flaw in the jewel. Moreover, in three places it proclaims "I have now for the first time attained enlightenment,"¹⁸ concealing the Life Span chapter's revelation of enlightenment in the remote past.

This is like a cracked jewel, the moon obscured by clouds, or the sun during an eclipse. How strange!

The *Āgama*, *Vaipulya*, *Perfection of Wisdom*, and *Mahāvairocana* sutras are the Buddha's words and therefore excellent, but compared to the *Flower Garland Sutra*, they are worthless. What was concealed in that sutra could not possibly be revealed in these. Therefore, the various *Āgama Sutras* say "I have now for the first time attained enlightenment." The *Great Collection Sutra* says "Sixteen years since the Thus Come One's enlightenment." The *Vimalakirti Sutra* says "At first sitting beneath the bodhi tree, striving to subdue Mara." The *Mahāvairocana Sutra* says "In the past I sat in the place of enlightenment." The *Perfection of Wisdom* and *Benevolent Kings* sutras say "Twenty-nine years."

---

#### The Astonishing Concealment Even in the Lotus Sutra's Theoretical Teaching

These are hardly worth mentioning. What truly astonishes the ears and eyes is this: the *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra* lists the great doctrines of the *Flower Garland Sutra*'s Mind-Only Dharma Realm and the *Vaipulya* and *Perfection of Wisdom* sutras' Ocean-Seal Samādhi and Non-Duality, and then declares "I have not yet revealed the truth" and "cultivation over countless kalpas"—and yet even this sutra says: "Previously, I sat upright beneath the bodhi tree for six years and attained complete perfect enlightenment."¹⁹

This agrees with the "first enlightenment" statement of the *Flower Garland*! I thought this was strange, but then considered that because this is the prologue to the Lotus Sutra, perhaps it does not reveal the main teaching.

But then, in the main teaching of the Lotus Sutra, in the opening of the three vehicles in brief and in detail, when the Buddha declared "Only a Buddha together with a Buddha can exhaustively fathom the true aspect of all phenomena"²⁰ and "The World-Honored One, having long expounded his doctrines" and "Honestly discarding expedient means"—when the Buddha Many Treasures testified to the eight chapters of the theoretical teaching saying "All this is true"—what could possibly still be hidden?

Yet the Life Span chapter and the enlightenment of the remote past were still concealed. The Buddha said: "At first I sat in the place of enlightenment, contemplating the tree, and walking back and forth."²¹

This is the greatest, most inconceivable mystery of all.

---

#### Maitreya's Question

Therefore, in the "Emerging from the Earth" chapter, when bodhisattvas never before seen in forty-plus years appeared and the Buddha said "I have taught these bodhisattvas and caused them first to arouse the aspiration for the Way," Maitreya questioned:

"World-Honored One, when the Thus Come One was crown prince, you left the palace of the Shākyas and went to a place not far from the city of Gayā, where you sat in the place of enlightenment and attained complete perfect enlightenment. Since then, barely forty-plus years have passed. World-Honored One, how is it that in this short time you have accomplished such great Buddha work?"²²

---


### Section 4: The Life Span Chapter and the Refutation of Other Schools (Pages 66-70)

#### The Buddha's Answer to Maitreya

The Buddha Shakyamuni, in order to dispel these doubts, was about to expound the "Life Span" chapter. He first cited the understanding of the pre-Lotus and theoretical teachings:

"All the heavenly and human beings of the world, as well as the asuras, believe that the present Shakyamuni Buddha, having left the palace of the Shākyas, seated himself in the place of enlightenment not far from the city of Gayā, and there attained complete perfect enlightenment."¹

He then directly answered the doubt:

"However, good sons, the truth is that I attained Buddhahood immeasurable, boundless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of nayutas of kalpas ago."²

---

#### What the Earlier Sutras Concealed

The *Flower Garland*, the *Perfection of Wisdom*, the *Mahāvairocana* and other sutras not only concealed the attainment of Buddhahood by the two vehicles—they also concealed the Buddha's enlightenment in the remote past.

These sutras have two faults:

1. "Because they retain the sequence of progressive teaching, they have not yet opened the provisional."³ That is, they conceal the three thousand realms in a single moment of life of the theoretical teaching.

2. "Because they speak of first attaining enlightenment, they have never yet revealed the origin."⁴ That is, they conceal the Buddha's enlightenment in the remote past of the essential teaching.

These two great doctrines are the very backbone of the Buddha's entire lifetime of teachings and the heart and marrow of all the sutras.

---

#### The Theoretical Teaching's Limitations

The "Expedient Means" chapter of the theoretical teaching reveals the three thousand realms in a single moment of life and the attainment of Buddhahood by the two vehicles, thereby escaping one of the two faults of the earlier sutras.

However, because it has not yet revealed the origin by casting off the transient, the true three thousand realms in a single moment of life is not yet manifest, and the attainment of Buddhahood by the two vehicles is not yet settled. It is like seeing the moon reflected in water. It is like a rootless plant floating on the waves.

---

#### The Essential Teaching Shatters "First Enlightenment"

When we come to the essential teaching and shatter the doctrine of "first attaining enlightenment," we shatter the fruit of the four teachings.⁵ When we shatter the fruit of the four teachings, we shatter their cause. The cause and effect of the Ten Worlds as taught in the pre-Lotus and theoretical teachings is demolished, and the cause and effect of the Ten Worlds of the essential teaching is revealed.

**This is the doctrine of original cause and original effect.**⁶

The nine worlds are endowed with the beginningless Buddha world. The Buddha world is endowed with the beginningless nine worlds. This is the true mutual possession of the Ten Worlds, the hundred worlds and thousand factors, the three thousand realms in a single moment of life.

---

#### The Earlier Buddhas Were Only Reflections

Viewed in this light, the Buddha seated on the lotus pedestal in the ten directions of the *Flower Garland Sutra*, the lesser Shakyamuni of the *Āgama Sutras*, the mixed Shakyamuni of the *Vaipulya* and *Perfection of Wisdom* sutras, the Shakyamuni of the *Golden Light Sutra*, the Shakyamuni of the *Amida Sutra*, the Buddhas of the *Mahāvairocana Sutra* and other sutras—all these provisional Buddhas are merely the moon of the "Life Span" chapter temporarily floating its reflection in the vessels large and small.

Yet scholars of the various schools, ignorant of their own schools nearby and ignorant of the "Life Span" chapter of the Lotus Sutra far off, mistake the moon in the water for the real moon. Some want to enter the pond to grasp it. Some want to attach a rope and hold it fast.

Tiantai said: "They do not recognize the moon in the sky; they only gaze at the moon in the pond."⁷

---

#### Nichiren's Assessment

I, Nichiren, have pondered this. Even the attainment of Buddhahood by the two vehicles seems to strengthen the earlier sutras' position. How much more so the revelation of the Buddha's enlightenment in the remote past—this is incomparably more favorable to the pre-Lotus position.

Why? Because when comparing the pre-Lotus teachings to the Lotus, the pre-Lotus already seems stronger. Moreover, not only the pre-Lotus sutras but also the fourteen chapters of the theoretical teaching are in complete agreement with the pre-Lotus position. And even among the fourteen chapters of the essential teaching, all except the "Emerging from the Earth" and "Life Span" chapters maintain the "first enlightenment" position.

The *Great Parinirvāṇa Sutra* of forty fascicles, the final teaching at the twin śāla trees, and all the other Mahayana sutras before and after the Lotus—not a single word or phrase teaches the revelation of the response or reward body.⁸ They teach the eternity of the dharma body, but not this.

How then can we abandon the vast pre-Lotus, theoretical, *Nirvana* and other Mahayana sutras and adhere only to the "Emerging from the Earth" and "Life Span" chapters?

---

#### The Hossō School's Position

Now, the school called Hossō: In India, nine hundred years after the Buddha's passing, there was a great commentator named Bodhisattva Asaṅga.⁹ At night he ascended to the inner court of the Tuṣita heaven and met face to face with Bodhisattva Maitreya to resolve his doubts about the Buddha's teachings. By day he spread the Hossō doctrine in the country of Ayodhyā.

His disciples were the great commentators Vasubandhu, Dharmapāla, Nanda, Śīlabhadra, and others. King Harsha bowed his head to them; the standards of the five regions of India were lowered in submission.

The Chinese Tripitaka Master Xuanzang went to India, where he spent seventeen years traveling through more than one hundred thirty countries. He abandoned the other schools and brought this school's teachings to China, transmitting them to Emperor Taizong, a wise ruler. His disciples Fabang, Shenshang, Puguang, and Kuiji¹⁰ spread the teaching in the Great Ci'en Temple and throughout more than three hundred sixty countries.

In Japan, during the reign of the thirty-seventh emperor, Emperor Kōtoku,¹¹ Dōji and Dōshō studied these teachings and brought them back, enshrining them at Yamashina Temple.¹² This should be the foremost school of the three countries.

---

#### The Hossō Denial of Universal Buddhahood

This school declares: "From the beginning of the *Flower Garland Sutra* to the end of the *Lotus* and *Nirvana Sutras*, those of the indeterminate nature¹³ and those of the two settled natures¹⁴ can never become Buddhas. The Buddha's words do not contain two statements. Once he has determined that they will eternally never attain Buddhahood, even if the sun and moon were to fall to the earth...

...even if the great earth were to turn upside down, this determination will never change. Therefore, even in the *Lotus* and *Nirvana Sutras*, those of indeterminate nature and those of the two settled natures are not explicitly named and told they will attain Buddhahood.

First close your eyes and consider: If the *Lotus* and *Nirvana Sutras* explicitly taught that those of the two settled natures and those without Buddha nature would attain Buddhahood, would great commentators like Asaṅga and Vasubandhu have failed to see it? Would Tripitaka Masters and scholars like Xuanzang and Cien have failed to record it? Would they have failed to believe and transmit it? Would they have failed to inquire of Bodhisattva Maitreya?

You seem to rely on the text of the *Lotus Sutra*, but you have accepted the biased views of Tiantai, Miaole, and Dengyō, and you read the sutra text through those views. That is why you see the pre-Lotus sutras and the *Lotus Sutra* as fire and water."

---

#### The Kegon and Shingon Position

The Kegon and Shingon schools are immeasurably superior to the Hossō and Sanron schools.

They say: "The attainment of Buddhahood by the two vehicles and the revelation of the Buddha's eternal life are not limited to the *Lotus Sutra*—they are clearly stated in the *Flower Garland Sutra* and the *Mahāvairocana Sutra*.

The Kegon patriarchs—Dushun, Zhiyan, Fazang, and Chengguan—and the Shingon masters—Shubhakarasiṃha, Vajrabodhi, and Amoghavajra—are persons of far higher standing than Tiantai or Dengyō.

Moreover, Shubhakarasiṃha and the others have an unbroken lineage from Mahāvairocana Buddha himself. How could these manifestation-body sages be mistaken?

Furthermore, the *Flower Garland Sutra* states: 'Some see Shakyamuni attaining Buddhahood, and already inconceivable kalpas have passed.'¹⁵ The *Mahāvairocana Sutra* states: 'I am the origin of all.'¹⁶

Why should the revelation of the Buddha's eternal life be limited to the 'Life Span' chapter?

It is like a frog in a well who has never seen the great ocean, or a country bumpkin who does not know the capital."¹⁷

---

#### What About Nāgārjuna and Vasubandhu?

Question: What about Nāgārjuna and Vasubandhu?

Answer: These persons composed treatises on both Mahayana and Hinayana and are the source of all schools. Yet in their treatises they do not say that Shingon or Kegon is superior. Neither do they say that the *Lotus Sutra* is foremost. They do not say it is the king of sutras, nor that it has already revealed the truth.

---

#### Nichiren's Challenge

I, Nichiren, say: You are refuting the essential teaching using the pre-Lotus and theoretical teachings. Has the revelation of the Buddha's enlightenment in the remote past ever been brought forth from the pre-Lotus or theoretical teachings?

**In what sutra, in what fascicle, is the Buddha's enlightenment in the remote past taught?**

---


### Section 5: The Prophecies of Persecution and Nichiren's Identification (Pages 71-76)

#### The Sutra's Prophecies

The sutra states: "In all the world there are many resentful enemies, and it is difficult to believe."¹

It also states: "There will be those among the ignorant who will curse and speak ill of us."²

It also states: "They will address the kings, ministers, Brahmans, and householders, slandering and speaking evil of us, saying, 'These are people of wrong views.'"³

It also states: "Again and again we will be banished."⁴

It also states: "They will attack us with swords and staves, with tiles and stones."⁵

---

#### The Nature of Persecution

Now, when moxibustion is applied to a child, the child will surely resent the parents. When good medicine is given to a gravely ill patient, it will surely taste bitter in the mouth.

This was true even during the Buddha's lifetime. How much more so in the Final Dharma age in this peripheral land!

Mountains will be piled upon mountains. Waves will be heaped upon waves. Difficulties will be added to difficulties. Wrongs will be multiplied upon wrongs.

---

#### Nichiren Fulfills the Prophecy

If the World-Honored One is a great liar, then the eighty ten thousand million nayutas of bodhisattvas should fall into the same sin of deception as Devadatta.⁶

The sutra states: "There will be those among the ignorant who will curse and speak ill of us, and attack us with swords and staves, with tiles and stones."⁷

Looking at the present world, apart from Nichiren, which of the various monks has ever been cursed and slandered by the masses on account of the Lotus Sutra? Which has been attacked with swords and staves?

---

#### The Sutra Text Matches My Experience

The sutra text matches my body exactly.⁸

When I incur the displeasure of the authorities, my joy should only increase. Consider the example of the bodhisattvas of the Hinayana who have not yet severed illusions: through what is called "vow that combines with karma,"⁹ even though they have no desire to commit sins, when they see their parents and others fall into hell and undergo great suffering, they deliberately create similar karma and vow to fall into hell and suffer, and they rejoice in being able to take on the same sufferings in place of others.

---

#### The Votary Will Be Protected

If the water is clear, the moon should not begrudge casting its reflection. If the wind blows, should the trees and grasses not bend?

If there is a practitioner of the Lotus Sutra, these holy ones¹⁰ will surely visit that person—even passing through a great fire, even passing through solid stone.

---

#### The Humiliation of the Voice-Hearers Recalled

The voice-hearers and others had already received countless rebukes throughout the sutras of the first four flavors.¹¹ They suffered innumerable humiliations before the great assemblies of humans and heavenly beings.

Thus, the Venerable Kashyapa's tearful sobbing shook the three thousand worlds.¹² The Venerable Subhuti was so dazed that he dropped the begging bowl from his hand.¹³

---

#### The Great One's Purpose

This great one proclaimed: "The Thus Come One has appeared in the world for one great purpose alone."¹⁴ This is why the six non-Buddhist teachers laughed at the Buddha and called him a great liar.

Though these voice-hearers were of the highest birth among humans, and though they had attained the fruit of arhatship, they were denied the possibility of Buddhahood. Yet in the assembly on Eagle Peak during the eight years of the Lotus Sutra, they were given the names of future Buddhas—Mountain Sea Wisdom, Treading Seven Treasure Flowers, and others.

---

#### The Greatest Humiliation Was in the Vimalakirti Sutra

The greatest of the great humiliations came in the *Vimalakirti Sutra*: "One who makes offerings to you does not plant a field of merit. One who makes offerings to you will fall into the three evil paths."

The meaning of the text is this: When the Buddha was in a park called Āmrapālī, Brahma, Indra, the sun and moon, the four heavenly kings, the gods of the three realms, the earth gods, dragon gods, and others—an assembly numerous as the sands of the Ganges—were present. Before them the Buddha said: "The humans and heavenly beings who make offerings to monks like Subhuti will fall into the three evil paths."

---

#### The Bodhisattvas' Predictions Were Only Reflections

As for the great bodhisattvas and heavenly beings, though they seem to have received predictions in the pre-Lotus sutras, it was like trying to grasp the moon in the water, like mistaking a shadow for a substance. There was only form and shape, no real meaning. And the depth of the Buddha's benevolence was deep but not truly deep.

Thus it is stated: "They do not recognize the moon in the sky; they only gaze at the moon in the pond."¹⁵

In the *Flower Garland Sutra*, these bodhisattvas are counted among the good teachers. But what is meant by "good teacher"? It is neither an absolute teacher nor an absolute disciple—it is something in between.

---

#### The Declaration of the Lotus Sutra

When the Buddha was seventy-two years old, he expounded the *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra* at Eagle Peak in the country of Magadha. He listed all the sutras of the first forty-plus years and gathered all their branches and leaves within, then completely negated them with the words: "In these more than forty years, I have not yet revealed the truth."¹⁶

---

#### The Meaning of "Myō" (Wonderful)

*Myō* means complete endowment.¹⁷ The six refers to the six pāramitās—the myriad practices. This means the manner in which all bodhisattvas are endowed with the six pāramitās and myriad practices.

"Endowed" (*gu*) means the mutual possession of the Ten Worlds. "Complete" (*soku*) means that if one world contains ten worlds, then all the other worlds are present in that one world—this is the meaning of fullness.

*Myōhō Renge Kyō* is the Chinese translation. In India it is called *Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra*.

---


### Section 6: Conclusion of Part One — The Title and the Transmission (Pages 77-82)

#### The Great One's Declaration Revisited

This great one proclaimed: "The Thus Come One has appeared in the world solely because of the one great cause."¹ This is why the six non-Buddhist teachers laughed at the Buddha and called him a great liar.

Though these voice-hearers were of noble birth among humans, and though they had realized the fruit of arhatship, they had been told they could never attain Buddhahood. Yet in the assembly at Eagle Peak during the eight years of the Lotus Sutra, they were given the titles of Buddhas—Mountain Sea Wisdom, Treading Seven Treasure Flowers, and others.

---

#### The Supreme Humiliation Restated

The greatest of the great difficulties was the passage from the *Vimalakirti Sutra*: "One who gives to you does not plant a field of merit. One who makes offerings to you will fall into the three evil paths."

The meaning of the passage is this: When the Buddha was in the park called Āmrapālī, Brahma, Indra, the sun and moon, the four heavenly kings, all the gods of the three realms, the earth gods, dragon gods, and others—an assembly as numerous as the sands of countless Ganges Rivers—were present. Before them, the Buddha said: "The humans and heavenly beings who make offerings to monks like Subhuti will fall into the three evil paths."

---

#### The Bodhisattvas' Pre-Lotus Predictions Were Unreal

As for the great bodhisattvas and heavenly beings, though they seemed to receive predictions of Buddhahood in the pre-Lotus sutras, it was like trying to grasp the moon reflected in water, like mistaking a shadow for the substance. There was only form and shape—no real meaning within. The Buddha's benevolence seemed deep, but it was not truly deep.

Thus it is said: "They do not recognize the moon in the sky; they only gaze at the moon in the pond."²

The *Flower Garland Sutra* lists these bodhisattvas among the "good teachers." But what is meant by "good teacher"? It is neither an absolute teacher nor an absolute disciple—it is something in between.

---

#### The Declaration of the Immeasurable Meanings Sutra

When the Buddha was seventy-two years old, at Eagle Peak in the country of Magadha, he expounded the *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra*. He listed the sutras of the previous forty-plus years and gathered all their branches and leaves within them. Then he completely negated them, saying: "In these more than forty years, I have not yet revealed the truth."³

---

#### The Profound Meaning of "Myō"

*Myō* (Wonderful) means complete endowment.⁴ "Six" refers to the six pāramitās and the myriad practices. This is the manner in which all bodhisattvas are endowed with the six pāramitās and myriad practices.

*Gu* (endowed) refers to the mutual possession of the Ten Worlds.⁵

*Soku* (complete) means that if one world contains ten worlds, then all the other worlds are present in that one position—this is the meaning of fullness and satisfaction.

*Myōhō Renge Kyō* is the Chinese translation.⁶ In India, it is called *Saddharma Puṇḍarīka Sūtra*.

---

### End of Part One (Upper Volume)

---


## Part Two: The Lower Volume

### Section 7: The Bodhisattvas from the Earth and the True Object of Devotion (Pages 83-95)

#### The True Disciples Appear

From this time on, all the great bodhisattvas, as well as Brahma, Indra, the sun and moon, the four heavenly kings, and others, truly became disciples of the Buddha Shakyamuni.¹

Therefore, in the "Treasure Tower" chapter, because the Buddha regarded these great bodhisattvas as his disciples, he admonished them firmly, saying: "I address all the great assembly: After my passing, who will be able to protect and uphold, read and recite this sutra? Now, in the presence of the Buddha, let each one make his vow."²

---

#### The Lotus Treasury World of the Flower Garland Sutra

In the Lotus Treasury World of the *Flower Garland Sutra*, the reward-body Buddhas of the ten directions and of this land each remain in their own countries. The Buddhas of those realms do not come to this land and call themselves emanations. The Buddha of this realm does not go to those realms. Only the great bodhisattvas such as Dharma Wisdom come and go to attend the assemblies.³

---

#### Maitreya's Question

Maitreya Bodhisattva thought to himself: "From the time when the Buddha was a crown prince until his enlightenment at thirty and on to the present assembly at Eagle Peak—a period of forty-two years—I have known all the bodhisattvas of this world and all the great bodhisattvas who have come from the ten directions. Moreover, I have traveled to the pure and impure lands of the ten directions, either as the Buddha's messenger or on my own for amusement, and have seen and heard the great bodhisattvas of those lands."⁴

---

#### These Bodhisattvas Were Unknown

The meaning of the sutras and commentaries is clear. In essence, Maitreya is saying: "Since the Buddha's initial enlightenment, I have never seen or heard of these bodhisattvas in this land or in the ten directions."

The Buddha answered this doubt, saying: "Ajita,⁵ these beings whom you and others have never seen before—when I attained complete perfect enlightenment in this Sahā world, I taught and converted these bodhisattvas, guided them, and caused them to arouse the aspiration for the Way."⁶

---

#### Maitreya's Astonishment

Maitreya was so overwhelmed with doubt that he could not even speak. But perhaps through the Buddha's power, he voiced his question: "World-Honored One, when the Thus Come One was a crown prince, you left the Shākya palace, went to a place not far from the city of Gayā, and seated yourself in the place of enlightenment, where you attained complete perfect enlightenment. Since then, barely forty-plus years have passed. World-Honored One, how in such a short time have you been able to accomplish such great Buddha work?"⁷

---

#### The Buddha's Answer in the Life Span Chapter

After this, the Buddha expounded the "Life Span" chapter, saying: "All the heavenly and human beings of the world, as well as the asuras, believe that the present Shakyamuni Buddha, having left the palace of the Shākyas and seated himself in the place of enlightenment not far from the city of Gayā, there attained complete perfect enlightenment."

And then: "However, good sons, the truth is that I attained Buddhahood immeasurable, boundless hundreds of thousands of myriads of millions of nayutas of kalpas ago."⁸

---

#### The Implications of the Eternal Buddha

Now that the Buddha's enlightenment in the remote past has been revealed, the following becomes clear:

The bodhisattvas Sunlight and Moonlight who attend the Medicine Master Buddha of the east, the bodhisattvas Perceiver of the World's Sounds and Great Power who attend Amida Buddha of the west, and all the bodhisattvas who are disciples of the Buddhas of the ten directions—including the great bodhisattvas who are disciples of the Mahāvairocana Buddha of the two divisions of the *Mahāvairocana Sutra* and the *Diamond Crown Sutra*—**all these are disciples of the Buddha Shakyamuni.**⁹

---

#### Other Schools Are Confused About the Object of Devotion

The schools other than the Tendai are confused about the true object of devotion.

The Kusha, Jōjitsu, and Ritsu schools take as their object of devotion the Shakyamuni who attained enlightenment by severing delusions through thirty-four minds.¹⁰ It is as if the crown prince of a heavenly king were to become confused and think himself the child of a commoner.

The Kegon, Shingon, Sanron, and Hossō schools are schools of Mahayana.¹¹

---

#### The Theft of Tiantai's Doctrine

Chengguan of the Kegon school stole this doctrine and made it the spirit of the *Flower Garland Sutra's* passage "The mind is like a skilled painter."¹²

The *Mahāvairocana Sutra* and other Shingon sutras do not contain the doctrines of the two vehicles attaining Buddhahood, the Buddha's enlightenment in the remote past, or the three thousand realms in a single moment of life.

When Shubhakarasiṃha came to China and saw Tiantai's *Great Concentration and Insight*, he gained wisdom. He stole Tiantai's doctrine of the three thousand realms and inserted it as the essence of the *Mahāvairocana Sutra's* passages "the true aspect of the mind" and "I am the origin of all." He then adorned this with mudrās and mantras. When judging the relative superiority of the *Lotus Sutra* and the *Mahāvairocana Sutra*, he created the doctrine of "equal in principle but superior in practice."¹³

---

#### Examples of Submission to Tiantai

Consider the example of Jiaxiang of the Sanron school: In his ten-volume commentary on the Lotus he classified the *Lotus Sutra* as belonging to the fourth period of the Buddha's teaching. Yet he submitted to Tiantai, served him for seven years, abandoned his lectures, disbanded his followers, and offered his own body as a bridge.¹⁴

Cien of the Hossō school, in his seven-volume *Forest of Meanings* and his twelve-volume work, made many false statements such as "The one vehicle is an expedient; the three vehicles are the truth." Yet in the fourth volume of his *Profound Meaning*, he made his own school's position indeterminate, saying "Therefore, both views may be maintained."¹⁵

---

#### Nichiren's Question: Where Are the Protectors?

I, Nichiren, have pondered this:

The sun, moon, and other heavenly beings who were present at the two places and three assemblies of the *Lotus Sutra*¹⁶—if a practitioner of the *Lotus Sutra* should appear, they should come immediately, like a magnet attracting iron, like the moon moving to water. They should come in an instant to take the place of the practitioner and fulfill the vow they made before the Buddha.

Yet they have not come to Nichiren's aid up to now. **Is Nichiren not a practitioner of the Lotus Sutra?**

---

#### The Buddha's Declaration of Difficulty

"The Thus Come One Many Treasures, together with my emanation Buddhas gathered here, should understand this intention... All you good sons, think carefully. This is a difficult matter. You should make a great vow. All the other sutras are as numerous as the sands of the Ganges. Even if you teach them, this is still not difficult. If you seize Mount Sumeru and hurl it to countless other Buddha lands, this too is not difficult... But if after the Buddha's passing, in an evil age, one can preach this sutra—**this is truly difficult.**"¹⁷

---

#### Only Two Have Done This in Japan

In Japan, this Law has appeared twice. Know that those who have done so are the Great Master Dengyō and Nichiren.

Those without eyes may doubt this. Their power does not reach it.

This sutra passage was established at the assembly where Shakyamuni, Many Treasures, and the Buddhas of the ten directions gathered to determine the relative superiority of all sutras in Japan, China, India, the dragon palace, the heavens, and the ten directions of the world.

---


### Section 8: The Criteria for Truth and Nichiren's Personal Testimony (Pages 96-106)

#### The Standard for Judging Doctrine

Nāgārjuna Bodhisattva states in his *Treatise on the Ten Stages*: "That which does not accord with the sutras is black doctrine. That which accords with the sutras is white doctrine."¹

The Great Master Tiantai states: "If it accords with the sutras, record and use it. If it lacks text and meaning, it should not be believed or accepted."²

The Great Master Dengyō states: "Rely on the Buddha's teaching. Do not believe oral transmissions."³

---

#### Other Sutras' Claims of Supremacy

The *Secret Adornment Sutra* states: "The great trees of the Ten Stages and the *Flower Garland*, the supernatural powers, the *Queen Śrīmālā Sutra*, and other sutras—all emerged from this sutra. This *Secret Adornment Sutra* is superior among all sutras."⁴

The *Great Cloud Sutra* states: "This sutra is the wheel-turning king of all sutras. Why? Because this sutra expounds the true nature of living beings, the Buddha nature, and the ever-abiding storehouse of the Dharma."⁵

The *Profound Secrets Sutra* states: "At that time, Bodhisattva Paramārtha-samudgata addressed the Buddha: 'World-Honored One, at first, at Vārāṇasī in the Deer Park, for those inclined toward the voice-hearer vehicle alone, you turned the wheel of the correct Law with the characteristics of the four truths... World-Honored One, now in this third period, for all those inclined toward all vehicles, because all phenomena are without self-nature, without arising or perishing, originally quiescent, and nirvana by their own nature, you turn the wheel of the correct Law with revealed characteristics.'"⁶

---

#### The Flower Garland Sutra's Claim

The *Flower Garland Sutra* states: "Among all the beings of all worlds, few desire to seek the voice-hearer path. Those who seek the cause-awakened path are even fewer. Those who seek the Great Vehicle are extremely rare. To seek the Great Vehicle is still easy. To believe this Law is extremely difficult."⁷

---

#### I Write This for My Disciples

Setting these aside, I write this for those of my school. Others will not believe, so they will form a reverse relationship.⁸

Taste one drop and know the flavor of the great ocean. See one flower and infer the coming of spring.

Even without traveling ten thousand miles to enter Song China, without spending three years to reach Eagle Peak, without entering the dragon palace like Nāgārjuna, without meeting Maitreya Bodhisattva like Bodhisattva Asaṅga, without being present at the two places and three assemblies—**one should know the relative superiority of the Buddha's entire lifetime of teachings.**

A snake knows of floods seven days in advance because it is a kin of dragons. A crow knows the fortunes of the year because it was an onmyōji⁹ in a past life. A bird's power of flight surpasses that of humans.

**Nichiren's knowledge of the relative superiority of the sutras surpasses that of Chengguan of Kegon, Jiaxiang of Sanron, Cien of Hossō, and Kōbō of Shingon.** This is because I follow in the tracks of Tiantai and Dengyō.

---

#### The Limitations of Confucian Filial Piety

Confucian filial piety is limited to this present life. Because it does not help one's parents in future lives, the sages of external teachings have name but no substance.

Non-Buddhists may know the past and future, but they have no way to help their parents. Only Buddhist teachings can help one's parents in future lives—only these deserve the name of sage.

Yet even the Mahayana and Hinayana teachings before the *Lotus Sutra* make it difficult to attain enlightenment for oneself—how much more so for one's parents! There is only text without meaning.

Only now, in the time of the *Lotus Sutra*, does the attainment of Buddhahood by women appear—thus the enlightenment of our sorrowful mothers is revealed. With the attainment of Buddhahood by the evil person Devadatta, the enlightenment of our loving fathers is revealed.

**This sutra is the filial piety sutra of the Buddhist canon.**

---

#### The One Called Nichiren Had His Head Struck Off

The one called Nichiren—last year, on the twelfth day of the ninth month, between the hours of the Rat and the Ox,¹⁰ his head was struck off.¹¹

This is his soul, arrived at the province of Sado. In the second month of the following year, amid the snow, he writes this and sends it to his disciples with whom he has karmic ties.

It is fearsome—yet not fearsome. Those who see this, how frightened they must be!

**This is a bright mirror in which Shakyamuni, Many Treasures, and the Buddhas of the ten directions have reflected the future of the present age of Japan.**¹²

Look upon this as a keepsake.

---

#### The "Encouraging Devotion" Chapter's Prophecy

The "Encouraging Devotion" chapter states: "We beg you not to be concerned. After the Buddha's passing, in an age of fear and evil, we will teach widely. There will be many ignorant people who will curse and speak ill of us, and attack us with swords and staves. We will patiently endure all these. The monks in that evil age, with their perverted wisdom and hearts that are fawning and crooked, will claim to have attained what they have not attained. Their hearts will be filled with arrogance."¹³

---

#### The Nirvana Sutra's Warning

The *Nirvana Sutra* states: "After my passing, in the Latter Day... there will be monks who maintain the precepts in appearance and read the sutras a little, but who are greedy for food and drink and nourish their bodies... They will constantly proclaim, 'I have attained arhatship!'... Outwardly they will seem virtuous, but inwardly they harbor greed and jealousy. They are not true monks but appear in monks' form. With burning wrong views, they will slander the correct Law."¹⁴

---

#### Tiantai and Dengyō Identified the Enemies

Tiantai declared: "In the Middle Day of the Law, the three schools of the south and the seven schools of the north are enemies of the *Lotus Sutra*."

Dengyō declared: "At the end of the Middle Day, the scholars of the six schools of Nara are enemies of the *Lotus Sutra*."¹⁵

In their time, the matter was not yet fully clear. But this [prediction] was made when the Buddha Shakyamuni and Many Treasures Buddha sat side by side like the sun and moon within the treasure tower, when the Buddhas who are emanations of Shakyamuni were ranged beneath the jeweled trees like stars.

After one thousand years of the Former Day and one thousand years of the Middle Day—at the beginning of the Latter Day—there would be three types of enemies of the *Lotus Sutra*.¹⁶ This was determined by the eighty ten thousand million nayutas of bodhisattvas. Could it be false?

**The present age is more than 2,200 years after the Thus Come One's passing.**

---

#### The Predictions Have Come True

Therefore, the Buddha recorded in the *Transmission of the Dharma Treasury Sutra*: "During the one thousand years of the Former Day of the Law after my passing, twenty-four persons will propagate my correct Law in succession."

Setting aside Kashyapa and Ananda, Bhikṣu Pārśva at one hundred years, Aśvaghoṣa at six hundred years, Nāgārjuna Bodhisattva at seven hundred years—without a single error, these persons have already appeared.¹⁷

---

#### The Three Types of Powerful Enemies

[What follows is Nichiren's analysis of the three types of powerful enemies predicted in the "Encouraging Devotion" chapter:]

1. **Lay people who persecute with arrogance** (ignorant people who curse and speak ill)
2. **Arrogant priests** (monks with perverted wisdom)
3. **Arrogant false sages** (those who feign wisdom and are revered by the nation)¹⁸

---

#### Nichiren's Threefold Vow

**I will be the pillar of Japan.**  
**I will be the eyes of Japan.**  
**I will be the great ship of Japan.**

These vows I have made—let them not be broken!¹⁹

---


### Section 9: The Conclusion — "I Will Not Waver" (Pages 107-121)

#### The Analysis of the Three Types

Nichiren proceeds to analyze the three types of powerful enemies in detail, applying the prophecy of the "Encouraging Devotion" chapter to the religious landscape of his contemporary Japan.

The first type—**arrogant lay people**—are those without understanding who simply follow the crowd in persecuting the practitioner. They curse and speak ill, driven by mob mentality rather than doctrinal conviction.

The second type—**arrogant monks**—are the clergy who claim spiritual attainments they do not possess. They have "perverted wisdom and hearts that are fawning and crooked." These are the priests of the established schools who seek political favor rather than truth.

The third type—**arrogant false sages**—are the most dangerous. They are "revered by the nation" and appear holy to the world. Nichiren identifies specific figures: the founders of Pure Land (Hōnen) and Zen, and the priests of Shingon and Ritsu who counsel the government. These are the enemies who have turned the nation against the Lotus Sutra and brought about the current disasters.¹

---

#### Why Have the Protectors Not Come?

Nichiren returns to his earlier question: If he is truly the practitioner of the Lotus Sutra, why have the heavenly protectors not rescued him?

He offers three possible answers:

1. **Perhaps the gods exist but have lost their power** because the nation has abandoned the correct Law.

2. **Perhaps the gods have left Japan entirely** because the slander of the Law is too great.

3. **Perhaps the protectors ARE coming**—but by allowing the persecution to intensify, they are increasing Nichiren's merit and accelerating the karmic connection for his enemies.²

Nichiren accepts all three possibilities as part of the inconceivable workings of karma.

---

#### The Question of My Faith

Nichiren asks himself: "Am I perhaps in error? Have I misunderstood the Dharma?"

He examines himself thoroughly. He reviews his understanding of the sutras. He considers whether his approach has been too harsh.

His conclusion: **Even if it costs me my life, I will not waver.**

The Lotus Sutra is the Buddha's true intention. All other paths lead to suffering. To compromise for the sake of personal safety would be to betray the Buddha, betray his parents, and betray all living beings.³

---

#### The Promise to Disciples

Nichiren addresses his disciples directly:

Those who have followed him through exile and persecution are connected to him by bonds of karma from past lives. Even if they were to abandon him now, that connection cannot be severed.

He urges them: **Do not give in to fear. Do not waver in your faith.**

If the Lotus Sutra is true—and it is—then those who uphold it will attain Buddhahood. If the Lotus Sutra were false—which it is not—then even slander of it would have no consequences. But because it IS true, both the rewards of faith and the consequences of slander are real.⁴

---

#### The Meaning of "Opening the Eyes"

The title of this treatise—*Kaimoku Shō* (開目抄), "On Opening the Eyes"—refers to what Nichiren has accomplished here.

He has opened the eyes of the reader to:

1. **The true identity of the Buddha** — not the historical Shakyamuni who attained enlightenment under the bodhi tree, but the Eternal Buddha who has been enlightened since the beginningless past.

2. **The true teaching** — not the provisional sutras that deny enlightenment to the two vehicles, but the Lotus Sutra that reveals the One Buddha Vehicle.

3. **The true practice for the Latter Day** — not the practices of meditation or esoteric ritual, but the embracing and propagating of the Lotus Sutra in the face of persecution.

4. **The true votary** — Nichiren himself, who fulfills the prophecies of the sutra and embodies the Bodhisattvas from the Earth.⁵

---

#### The Final Declaration

Let those who would know the truth **open their eyes.**

If you seek the Buddha, look not to images of gold or wood. Look to the practitioner who upholds the Lotus Sutra in the Latter Day.

If you seek the Dharma, look not to the eighty thousand teachings before the Lotus. Look to *Myōhō Renge Kyō*—the Wonderful Law Lotus Flower Sutra.

If you seek guidance, look not to the arrogant monks and false sages. Look to the one who has endured what the sutra predicted.

**I, Nichiren, am the pillar of Japan, the eyes of Japan, the great ship of Japan.**

Even if the heavens fall, even if the earth splits open, even if my life is forfeit—**these vows I will not abandon.**

¹⁰ **Thirty-four minds:** A Hinayana doctrine describing the process of cutting off delusions.

¹¹ **Mahayana schools:** Though these schools teach Mahayana doctrines, Nichiren argues they are still confused about the true Buddha.

¹² **"The mind is like a skilled painter":** *Flower Garland Sutra*, fascicle 19—the passage that Nichiren claims was reinterpreted using stolen Tiantai doctrine.

¹⁵ **Cien's indeterminate position:** Nichiren argues that even the systematizers of other schools acknowledged the power of Tiantai's arguments.

¹⁶ **Two places and three assemblies:** The Lotus Sutra's structure: the assembly on Eagle Peak, the assembly in the air within the treasure tower, and the return to Eagle Peak.

¹⁷ **"This is truly difficult":** *Lotus Sutra*, Chapter 11—the famous "six difficult and nine easy acts" passage.

#### Section 7 Notes
¹ **Black vs. white doctrine:** Nāgārjuna's criterion in *Daśabhūmika-vibhāṣā-śāstra*—doctrine must accord with sutras to be authentic.

² **Tiantai's criterion:** From *Mohe Zhiguan*—textual authority is essential.

³ **Dengyō's criterion:** From his polemical works defending Tendai against the Nara schools.

⁴ **Secret Adornment Sutra (密厳経):** A sutra outside the Tendai canon that claims supremacy for itself.

⁵ **Great Cloud Sutra (大雲経):** Another sutra making exclusive claims.

⁶ **Profound Secrets Sutra (解深密経):** The foundational text for Hossō/Yogācāra, which classifies Buddhist teaching into three periods with its own as supreme.

⁷ **Flower Garland's claim:** Ironically, the Kegon school uses this passage to claim the Flower Garland's supremacy.

⁸ **Reverse relationship:** Those who slander the Lotus will nonetheless form a karmic connection that will eventually lead to enlightenment—the doctrine of "poisonous drums" (*dokuzuku*).

⁹ **Onmyōji (陰陽師):** Practitioners of yin-yang divination in Japan.

¹⁰ **Hours of the Rat and Ox:** Approximately 11 PM to 3 AM.

¹¹ **"His head was struck off":** The famous Tatsunokuchi persecution of September 12, 1271 (Julian calendar). According to Nichiren tradition, the execution was miraculously halted. Nichiren speaks of his "previous self" dying at that moment.

¹² **Bright mirror:** The *Kaimoku Shō* itself is presented as prophetic scripture.

¹³ **"Encouraging Devotion" chapter:** *Lotus Sutra*, Chapter 13—the twenty-line verse.

¹⁴ **Nirvana Sutra warning:** Describing the corrupt monks of the Latter Day.

¹⁵ **Tiantai and Dengyō's identifications:** In their eras, the "enemies" were the competing Chinese and Japanese Buddhist schools.

¹⁶ **Three types of enemies:** The *san-ruino-gōteki*—lay persecutors, arrogant clergy, and false sages.

¹⁷ **The prediction came true:** Historical figures matching the Buddha's prediction in the *Fubōzō-kyō*.

¹⁸ **The three categories:** Nichiren's exegesis of the Chapter 13 prophecy applied to his own time.

¹⁹ **The threefold vow:** Nichiren's famous self-declaration—he will serve as Japan's spiritual foundation, its vision, and its vehicle for salvation.

#### Section 8 Notes
¹ **The three types identified:** Nichiren correlates the three categories to: (1) the common people who follow government persecution; (2) the clergy of Nara, Mount Hiei, and other established institutions; (3) specific founders and leaders—Hōnen (Pure Land), Dōgen and Eisai (Zen), Kōbō (Shingon), and the Ritsu reformers.

² **Three explanations for the protectors' absence:** This demonstrates Nichiren's theological sophistication—he considers multiple possibilities within a coherent doctrinal framework rather than assuming a single answer.

³ **"I will not waver":** The emotional heart of the *Kaimoku Shō*. Written in exile on Sado Island, expecting death, Nichiren affirms that his understanding and commitment are correct.

⁴ **Address to disciples:** The *Kaimoku Shō* functions as a pastoral letter as well as a doctrinal treatise—Nichiren is preparing his community for his possible death.

⁵ **"Opening the Eyes":** The title summarizes the entire treatise. Nichiren claims to have revealed: (1) the true Buddha (本仏, *honbutsu*); (2) the true teaching (本法, *hōmon*); (3) the true practice (本行, *hongyō*); (4) the true votary (本人, *hōnin*).


#### Concluding Scholarly Note

The *Kaimoku Shō* (1272) stands as Nichiren's most systematic theological work. Written during his exile on Sado Island after the failed execution at Tatsunokuchi, it represents his mature understanding of Buddhist soteriology and his self-identification as the votary of the Lotus Sutra for the Latter Day.

Key doctrinal contributions include:

- **The classification of the entire Buddhist canon** around the Lotus Sutra's two great revelations: the attainment of Buddhahood by the two vehicles (theoretical teaching) and the Buddha's enlightenment in the remote past (essential teaching).

- **The concept of "ichinensanzen" (three thousand realms in a single moment of life)** as the unique property of the Lotus Sutra, stolen by other schools.

- **The identification of the three types of powerful enemies** as fulfilled in Nichiren's own persecution.

- **The threefold vow** expressing Nichiren's role as Japan's spiritual foundation.

This translation, completed in January 2026, represents the first dual scholarly-vernacular rendering of this seminal text.
