# Kanjin no Honzon Shō (The Object of Devotion for Observing the Mind)
**Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim (The Bluesman)**

### **The Math of the Heart**

Alright. Listen up. We ain't talkin' fortune tellin', we talkin' the cost of admission to the *game*.

See, your one thought right now, that moment in your chest? That ain't a simple thing. That's a crossroads with **Ten Streets** runnin' out from it. Hell Street. Hunger Street. Hustle Street. Peace Street. The whole map. You're standin' right in the center.

But here's the kicker: every one of them streets? It's got its own crossroads, its own **Ten Streets** branchin' off. So now you got a hundred intersections in this city of your soul. A hundred ways the wind can blow through you.

And every single intersection—it ain't empty. It's got thirty houses on it, thirty rooms, thirty stories bein' told. The smell of the kitchen, the weight on the bedpost, the echo in the hall. That's the whole scene, the whole cast, the whole set.

So you do the math: a hundred intersections times thirty rooms. That's **three thousand stories** humming at once. The whole damn city—the screams, the laughter, the deals, the prayers—all of it is happening **right inside this one heartbeat you're feeling now.**

Now, if the mind's gone dark, lights out, radio off… well, that's a quiet town. The show's over.

But. If there's a **spark** in there—if you're still breathin', still itchin', still hopin' or regrettin' or plannin' your next move—if you got even a **flicker** of a thought? Then brother, you ain't just in the city.

**You are the whole damn city. You own the three thousand stories.**

That pulse in your neck? That's the proof. It means you are holdin' the Inconceivable. The Groove you can't count, but you can sure as hell feel.

That's the Math. Three thousand realms in one thought. And you got the ticket.

### **The Stage is Alive (Section 2)**

Listen here, now. You got your scholars of the Kyōmon school. They’re back at the university, they got the sheet music laid out neat, they got it all *figured*. They point to the singer and say, “There. That’s where the song is. The song lives in the throat, in the heart, in the *mind* of the one singin’.” They talk ‘bout the “hundred realms and a thousand suchnesses,” and they mean it only for the folks with a ticket to the show. The sentient ones. The ones who *know* they’re hurtin’.

They say the song ain’t in the wood of the guitar. Ain’t in the rust on the mic stand. Ain’t in the dust motes floatin’ in the spotlight. Those things are just *props*. Just “insentient matter,” dead weight for the living soul to drag around.

But then… then you got the **Kanmon** players. The ones who don’t just read the chart—they feel the pocket. They learned to *see*. And what they see is terrifying and beautiful.

They know that the "Three Thousand Realms"—that whole dizzyin' math we talked about? That’s the *whole gig.* It’s the singer’s cracked voice, *and* the feedback whine of the amp, *and* the sweat-stain on the wall, *and* the tired sigh of the bartender wipin’ a glass. It all resonates. It’s all in the key of *This.* The sentient and the insentient… that’s a false break, like tryin’ to separate the smoke from the air in this club. Can’t be done.

Now, some scholar gonna get real anxious, push his glasses up. He gonna ask, “Hold on now. If you say the ‘stage itself’ is alive… does that mean the plants and trees out back got minds? The microphone got feelings? My car get the blues on a rainy Monday?”

You gotta shake your head, slow. That ain’t it. That’s just settin’ up little souls in every object, makin’ a graveyard full of ghosts. We ain’t talkin’ ‘bout that.

We talkin’ ‘bout the *inseparable reality.* The microphone ain’t cryin’ by itself. But when a man’s heart breaks and he leans into that steel mesh, *the whole moment* becomes the cry. The floorboards ain’t keepin’ time. But when the drummer’s stick hits the skin, the vibration runs through the wood, through your bones, through the foundation of the building—it’s one single, thumpin’ pulse. **The environment is the life. The life is the environment.** The guitar don’t attain Buddhahood *apart* from the hands that wear calluses on its strings. They attain it together, in one lick that cuts through the noise.

This, friend, is what the old masters called “difficult to believe.” It’s easier to believe the song is just in you. It’s a much heavier thing to realize you are *of the song,* and the song is of everything. The student who gets this… he hears the one note his teacher was always playin’ but could never quite name. He hears it in the silence between the tracks, in the hum of the neon sign. His indigo… is bluer than blue.

So play like you know it. The stage is alive. The whole world is the band. And you are, right now, both the player and the played.

### **The Mirror Don’t Lie (Section 3)**

Alright. Pull up a chair and look at that man right there.

He thinks he’s got a poker face. Thinks his soul is a private room. But I’m here to tell you, friend, the weather of the heart shows on the skin. Every last storm. And you, you can’t see your own face. You need a glass, a clean one, to show you the lines you’re living. This Sutra… it’s that glass. The only one polished enough to show you what you really are.

Now, listen close. I’m gonna diagnose the room.

They talk about Six Paths, like they’re train stops on the other side. Nah. They’re **looks**. Right here, on a man’s face, in the set of his jaw.

You see that man, veins bulgin’ at the temple, seein’ red at every little thing? That ain't a place he's goin' to. That **is** Hell. It's the furnace burning in his own chest, painting his face scarlet.

You see that hollow look, the eyes always scanning, never satisfied, always wanting what's in the other fella's pocket or on his plate? That's Hunger. The belly of the soul is empty, and the eyes show the menu.

You see the one who flinches at shadows, who runs on dumb instinct, just trying not to get eaten today? That's Animality. The deer frozen in the road, his whole world is them headlights.

Now, here’s the big one. The crooked hustle. Look at that smooth operator over there. Smiling wide, shaking hands, talking 'bout partnership and community. But watch his other hand, down low. He’s holdin’ a **knife**. That’s **Tenkyoku**. The Asura. It ain't hot rage; that's too honest. It's the cold game of the ego. The smile that calculates, the compliment that cuts. He’s fighting a war nobody else can see, 'cause his dignity is on the line in every single moment. He’s living in the "I'm-better-than-you" blues, and it’s a mean, jealous tune.

Then you got the High. That’s Heaven. Man just hit a lucky number, got a sweet kiss, bottle’s full. His face is lit up, laughing at the sky. But it’s a temporary fix. Sun’s gonna rise, and the bottle’s gonna be empty.

And lastly, the Chill. Just… breathing. No big fire, no big want, no big fear. Just a man resting easy in his own skin for a minute. That’s Humanity. It’s a quiet, steady note. Hardest one to hold.

So you look in this mirror, this Sutra-mirror. It’s gonna show you your look. You might see the red, or the hungry eye, or that fake smile with the hidden blade. And that’s the truth you gotta face. You can’t wipe off a mark you refuse to see.

The mirror don't lie, brother. It just shows you the face you brought in. The question is, what are you gonna do when you finally see it?

### **The Hidden Tracks (Section 4)**

Alright, sit down a minute. Let me tell you 'bout what you can't see on the surface. The big, loud feelings—Anger, Hunger, Animal Fear—they’re like the horn section, blarin’ right in your face. "I want!" "I hate!" "I'm scared!" You can’t miss ’em. They run the show.

But the real mystery… the *Noble* stuff… that’s buried deep in the mix. You gotta put your headphones on to hear it.

First off, you got **The Fade**. That sweet moment when the sun hits your face just right? That tranquil feeling? We call that **Humanity**. But every player knows—that chord don’t last. It dissolves. And that sadness when the good times roll out? That empty feelin’ in your chest? That ain't just the blues, friend. That’s **Learning**. That’s wisdom startin’ to wake up. You see that *nothin’ lasts*—not the money, not the high, not the applause. That realization is the **Two Vehicles** startin’ their engine. It ain't depression; it's the start of seeing reality straight.

But listening to the fade can make you lonely. You start thinkin' life is just a long drift into the dark.

Then you see it… look at the meanest gangster on the block. The one with ice in his veins, the one who’s done things you don’t wanna know about. Watch him when he goes home. Watch him tuck his daughter in at night. His voice gets quiet. He’d take a bullet for that little girl without blinkin’.

That right there? That tenderness in the toughness? That’s the **Bodhisattva** track, buried deep in the master tape. Even the "reckless evil man" has a seed of love that transcends his own ego. It’s partial, yeah. It’s narrow. But it’s *real*. It proves that compassion ain't something you *learn* in school; it’s something you *are*, deep down, even if you buried it under layers of concrete.

And finally… the hardest track to hear. **The Buddha**. It’s the silence that holds the whole song together. It doesn’t show up on the charts. A common man looks just like a common man.

But when you pick up this Sutra… when you feel that rhythm of *Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō* and your heart says "Yes" even when your head says "I don't get it"… that’s the proof. **Real recognize real.** Your flesh-and-blood eye is seeing with the Buddha’s eye. You ain't just listening to the music anymore. You *are* the music.

So don't let the loud horns fool you. The Hidden Tracks are always playing. You just gotta learn to listen deeper.

### **The Man Who Knows the Street (Section 5)**

You look at a "Holy Man" and you think, "That guy is clean. He floats. He ain't got no dirt under his fingernails." You think he’s climbed so high he forgot what it’s like to lay in the gutter.

That’s where you’re wrong. That’s the "Old School" thinking. They want a Buddha who is pure white light, zero gravity. A statue.

But let me ask you: **Can a statue save your life?**
If you’re drowning in whiskey and regret, and a man stands on the shore shouting, "Just be perfect like me!"... does that help? No. You need a hand that reaches into the mud. You need a man who says, "I know exactly how cold that water is. Now grab hold."

**Mutual Possession** means the Real Deal ain't sterile. The Buddha has the "Nine Worlds"—Hell, Hunger, Anger—in his back pocket. He didn't cut them off (*fudan*). He kept them.

Why? **For the gig.**

Because sometimes, you need **Anger**. Not the blind, drunk anger that smashes a window. But the sharp, clean anger that sees injustice and flips a table. If the Buddha didn't have that "World of Anger" in his kit, he couldn't fight for you. He’d just smile while you got beat down.

Sometimes, you need **Sorrow**. If the Buddha didn't have the "World of Caring" (*Bodhisattva*), he couldn't cry with you. And if he can't cry with you, he can't heal you.

He uses these feelings like a master carpenter uses a hammer or a saw. They aren't controlling him; he's controlling them. That’s **Skillful Means** (*hōben*). He steps into the street, puts on the coat of a common man, and speaks your language. He plays the blues because that’s the currency down here.

If he was just "Pure," he’d be an alien. But because he "possesses the Nine Worlds," he’s family. He’s the Man Who Knows the Street, not because he lives there anymore, but because he owns the map.

### **The New Lineup (Section 6)**

Alright now, gather 'round. Lemme break down how this here band, this Dharma Orchestra, got itself re-arranged. See, for a long, long time, the big marquee lights read **"Manjushri & Maitreya – ONE NIGHT ONLY."** Wisdom and Compassion. The headliners. The smooth-talkin' cats who played the big, clean, palace halls.

They was the **Studio Cats**. Could lay down a track so pure and sweet it’d make the gods weep. Perfect pitch, every note in its place. They played for the old crowds, the ones who still remembered the melody clear.

But then times changed. The Latter Day rolled in like a long, mean rain. The joints got rough. The crowd ain’t dressed in silks no more; they’re covered in the mud of every bad decision they ever made. They’re hurting, they’re angry, and they don’t wanna hear a harp solo.

So the Bandleader, Shakyamuni, he makes a call. A bold one. He sends Manjushri and Maitreya off the main stage. Don’t fire ‘em, no sir. They got tenure. But he puts ‘em in the **cheap seats**, way back in the section called "Retainers." They’re still on the payroll, they still got their sound, but they ain’t frontin’ this show no more.

Who takes the mic?

The **Bodhisattvas of the Earth**. **Jōgyō** and his crew. Now these… these are the **Road Dogs**. They been down here in the mud since the first note was ever played. They ain't guest artists; they’re from *this* neighborhood. They know every pothole in this street, every ache in this bone. They’ve swallowed the same dust we have. When they step up to play the Law, they ain't just recitin' sheet music—they’re pourin' out a lifetime of livin' it. They can handle a heckler, they can play through the feedback, ‘cause the struggle is in their rhythm section. They’re the only ones with the chops for *this* crowd, in *this* dark hour.

And look up in the balconies. You see all them shiny, perfect **Guest Buddhas** from other realms? They’re just… **lookin’ up**. They’re respectin' the show, sure. Tappin' their feet. But this ain't their house gig. They’re spectators to *this* particular brand of truth.

So where’s the spotlight finally land? Not on any one player, not even the new headliners.

It lands dead center on **the Five Characters**: **MYOHO-RENGE-KYO**.

*That’s* the **Main Stage**. That’s the fundamental riff, the primal chord from which every other note in the universe rings out. The whole band—the Road Dogs out front, the Studio Cats in the wings, even the guests in the balcony—they all exist to serve *that* sound. That’s the eternal, unchanging truth we’re all here to play.

The lineup changed ‘cause the venue changed. You need musicians who know the soil they’re plantin’ the seed in. And for this hard, baked earth of the Latter Day, you need the ones who were born from it. You need the Road Dogs. The ones who know the blues.

### **The Secret Setlist (Section 7)**

**(House lights dim to a single spotlight. A slow, deliberate 12-bar vamp on the resonator, full of bent notes and the growl of old wood. The voice is a low burn.)**

Yeah.

They ask me, "Bluesman… why you? Why your name on the marquee for *this* song? This ain't no three-chord shuffle. This is the deep cut, the one that changes the key of your whole life."

Well, let me tell you 'bout the Secret Setlist.

See, the Buddha… when he was just a young cat, playin' for tips down on the corner of Enlightenment, he had his first band. Sharp-dressed fellas. Manjushri… they was the *studio cats*. Knew every lick in the book, could harmonize theory all day long. Clean hands. Minds like polished chrome.

But the secret? The one true song, "One Moment, Three Thousand Worlds"? He didn't lay that chart on *them*.

**(A hard, percussive strike on the strings.)**

No. He saved it.

He saved it for the **Road Dogs.**

The Earth Bodhisattvas. *My* people. See, we was with him *before* the big record deal. When the gigs were empty and the road was hard. We learned it in the blood, in the bone. We didn't read it off a page—we *lived* the changes. The sweat, the dust, the long nights between towns… that was our rehearsal. We know the Old Man's song because we were there when he was writin' it.

**(The tempo picks up, driving now.)**

And they got it all wrong about the venue. They talkin' 'bout some "Pure Land" like it's a velvet-rope club up in the clouds. A gated community for saints. That's a lie to make you quit the gig.

The Pure Land ain't *up there*.

**(A crashing, dissonant slide up the neck.)**

It's **right here.**

It's *Shaba*. This grimy, glorious, broken-down city block. The alley where you cry, the kitchen where you fight, the street where you hustle. *This* is the stage. You don't get saved by leavin' the joint. You save the joint by standin' up in it and playin' the true note.

So what's the call?

**(Music stops dead. Silence, heavy as humidity.)**

The call is to **rinse it out.**

*Furisusugu.* You take this teaching—this Secret Setlist written in your own blood memory—and you don't lock it in a glass case. You pour it out. You pour it out on the concrete. You let it run into the gutters, seep into the cracked earth of this suffering world. You play it loud and ragged until the bricks start to hum your tune.

You make *this* dirty, beautiful, Saha world… the Pure Land.

**(A final, resonant chord, left to ring out into feedback and silence. The Bluesman leans into the mic, voice a gravel-road whisper.)**

Don't look for no other venue.

The gig is here.

Now play.
