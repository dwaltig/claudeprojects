# Kanjin no Honzon Shō (The Object of Devotion for Observing the Mind)
**Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel (The Professor)**

### Opening Section: The Theoretical Basis of Ichinen Sanzen

The fifth volume of the *Maka Shikan* states: "The mundane world (*seken*) and 'suchness' (*nyoze*) are one; the difference is merely one of expansion and contraction."[^1]

Now, a single mind (*ichinen*) possesses the Ten Worlds (*jikkai*)[^2]. Since each one of these worlds also possesses the Ten Worlds, there are one hundred worlds. Each world possesses the thirty kinds of realms (*sanjū-seken*)[^3], so the one hundred worlds inherently possess three thousand realms. This "three thousand" is contained within a single moment of thought (*ichinen no kokoro*). If there is no mind, that is the end of the matter. However, if there is even the slightest bit (*kaiji*) of mind, it inherently possesses the three thousand realms. This is precisely why it is called the "Inconceivable Realm" (*fukashigi-kyō*). And so forth.

### **Explanatory Footnotes**

[^1]: **Maka Shikan (摩訶止観):** *The Great Cessation and Contemplation*, the magnum opus of the Tiantai patriarch Zhiyi (538–597 CE). It systematizes the practice and theory of *shikan* (cessation and contemplation), the principal meditative discipline of Tiantai Buddhism, which leads to the direct insight into the true nature of reality.

[^2]: **Ten Worlds (Jikkai, 十法界):** A central Tiantai taxonomy of ten distinct states of life, from suffering to enlightenment, which are mutually inclusive and latent within each moment of consciousness. They are: Hell, Hunger, Animality, Anger, Humanity, Heaven (Rapture), Learning, Realization, Bodhisattva, and Buddhahood. The doctrine of their "mutual possession" (*jikkai gogu*) means that each world contains the potential for all ten within it, forming the foundational calculation for *Ichinen Sanzen*.

[^3]: **Thirty Realms (Sanjū-seken, 三十種世間):** A further elaboration of phenomenal reality, derived from the *Daichidoron*. It consists of ten suchnesses (*nyoze*), ten categories of living beings, and the five components of existence (*go'on*), along with the four noble truths and twelve-linked chain of dependent origination understood as aspects of the environment. When multiplied by the One Hundred Worlds (10x10), they yield the theoretical framework of Three Thousand Realms.

[^4]: **Ichinen Sanzen (一念三千):** *Three Thousand Realms in a Single Moment of Life*. The profound Tiantai doctrine, articulated by Zhiyi, which posits that the entirety of the phenomenal universe—encompassing all possible states of life (the Ten Worlds) and their environmental and ontological dimensions (the Thirty Realms)—is perfectly integrated and fully present within each fleeting moment of conscious awareness (*ichinen*). It expresses the non-duality of the subjective mind and the objective universe, and the inherent potential for Buddhahood in all phenomena.

### Section 2: The Difficulty of Belief (Sentient and Insentient)

**Question:** It is asked: What is the distinction between "the hundred realms and the thousand suchnesses" (*hyakkai sennyo*) and "three thousand realms in a single thought-moment" (*ichinen sanzen*)?

**Answer:** It is answered: "The hundred realms and the thousand suchnesses" is limited to the realm of sentient beings (*ujō*). "Three thousand realms in a single thought-moment" pervades both sentient and insentient beings (*hijō*).

**Doubt:** If the ten suchnesses pervade even insentient beings, does this not imply that plants and trees possess minds like sentient beings and effectively attain Buddhahood? How can this be?

**Answer:** This matter is "difficult to believe and difficult to understand" (*nanshin nange*).[^5] In the Tiantai tradition, there are two types of "difficult to believe and difficult to understand":
1.  The difficulty of believing and understanding in the **Doctrinal Gate** (*kyōmon*).[^6]
2.  The difficulty of believing and understanding in the **Meditative Gate** (*kanmon*).

Regarding the doctrines that preceded the Lotus Sutra (*nizen*), since they lack the principle of "three thousand realms in a single moment," the term "difficult to believe and difficult to understand" does not apply to them. In the theoretical teaching (*shakumon*), the principle of "hundred realms and thousand suchnesses" is determined, as it says: "Indigo is derived from blue, yet it is bluer than blue."

However, the "difficulty of believing and understanding in the Meditative Gate" refers specifically to the fact that the hundred realms and thousand suchnesses *are* the three thousand realms in a single moment. This fact exists in the *other* realm (the realm of insentient beings) just as fire is hot and water is cold. How can one not believe this?

Yet, the common view is that the minds of sentient beings pervade both sentient and insentient realms—this is a wholly false doctrine, a distorted view of the provisional schools. To admit material laws and cause-and-effect for insentient beings but deny them mental laws and Buddha-nature is the intent of the *Avatamsaka*, *Prajñā*, and other Mahayana sutras (but not the Lotus). If the Buddha-seed of *ichinen sanzen* did not reside in this sutra (the Lotus), how could the Buddha attain the Way and cause plants, trees, and the land itself to attain Buddhahood?

---
[^5]: **Difficult to believe and difficult to understand (*nanshin nange*):** A recurring phrase in the Lotus Sutra (e.g., Chapter 2 and Chapter 16) describing the profundity of the ultimate truth, which transcends ordinary logic.

[^6]: **Kyōmon vs. Kanmon:**
    *   **Kyōmon (Doctrinal Gate):** The study of the teachings through scripture and intellectual analysis.
    *   **Kanmon (Meditative Gate):** The direct observation of the mind (*kanjin*) to perceive reality. Nichiren here elevates the *Kanmon* (observation) over mere *Kyōmon* (theory), setting the stage for the practice of the Gohonzon—observing the "object of devotion" is the supreme "meditative gate."

### Section 3: Observing the Mind (Diagnosing the Ten Worlds)

**Question:** The source and origin have already been heard. But what is the meaning of the mind of "observing the mind" (*kanjin*)?

**Answer:** "Observing the mind" means to observe one's own mind and finding the Ten Worlds within it. For example, although we can see the six sense organs of others, we cannot see our own six sense organs on our own face. We only know our own six sense organs when we face a clear mirror. Even though the various sutras make reference here and there to the six paths and the four noble worlds, unless we look into the clear mirror of the *Lotus Sutra* and the *Maka Shikan* of the Great Teacher Tiantai, we cannot know the Ten Worlds, the hundred worlds and thousand suchnesses, and the three thousand realms in a single moment that we ourselves possess.

**Question:** What does this mean?

**Answer:** When we observe the faces of others, sometimes they are joyful, sometimes angry, sometimes calm; sometimes they manifest greed, sometimes foolishness, and sometimes flattery and perversity (*tenkyoku*).[^7]

*   Anger is **Hell** (*Jigoku*).
*   Greed is **Hunger** (*Gaki*).
*   Foolishness is **Animality** (*Chikushō*).
*   Flattery and Perversity is **Asura** (*Shura*).
*   Joy is **Heaven** (*Ten*).
*   Calmness is **Humanity** (*Nin*).

These six paths exist in the physical aspect of others' faces. Although the four noble worlds are hidden and do not appear, if we search for them carefully, they are there.

---
[^7]: **Flattery and Perversity (*tenkyoku*):** This term (*ten* meaning flattery/fawning, *kyoku* meaning crooked/twisted) defines the world of Asura. It is not merely "fighting" but a distorted state of ego where one fawns upon those stronger (or pretends virtue) while inwardly harboring jealousy and looking down on others. It is the psychology of the "fake" or the "hater."

### Section 4: The Four Noble Worlds (Hidden Potential)

**Question:** Although the Six Paths are not perfectly clear, we can roughly understand them by hearing of them and they seem to be present in us. But why are the Four Noble Worlds entirely unseen?

**Answer:** Previously, we doubted the existence of the Six Paths within the human world. [But now that we see them,] even though we force ourselves to speak of the Four Noble Worlds, they are merely provisional words. However, by adding reason to observation, we can describe a fraction of them.

Since the impermanence (*mujō*) of the world is right before our eyes, how can the human world lack the realms of the Two Vehicles (Learning and Realization)? Even a reckless evil person (*muko no akunin*) still loves his wife and children tenderly; this is a fraction of the Bodhisattva world.[^8]

However, the Buddha world alone is most difficult to manifest. Since we possess the nine worlds, we believe [by reason] that we possess the tenth. Do not harbor doubts. The *Lotus Sutra* states: "[The Buddhas appear] because they wish to cause sentient beings to open the wisdom of the Buddha." The *Nirvana Sutra* states: "Those who study the Mahayana, though they have mortal eyes, are named possessors of the Buddha Eye."

Born in the Latter Day of the Law, for a common mortal to believe in the Lotus Sutra is itself the proof that the human world is endowed with the Buddha world.

---
[^8]: **A fraction of the Bodhisattva world:** This is a radical definition of compassion. Nichiren argues that even a "reckless evil man" who causes harm to society still possesses the capacity for self-transcendence in his love for his family. This partial, localized love is the "seed" or "fraction" of the universal compassion of a Bodhisattva. It proves that the nature of "caring for others" is inherent in all beings, no matter how depraved.

### Section 5: Mutual Possession (The Buddha in Hell)

**Question:** I have heard previously that common mortals possess the Buddha world. However, I have never heard that the Buddha possesses the nine worlds.

**Answer:** [This is established in the sutras.] The "Life Span" (*Juryō*) chapter of the *Lotus Sutra* states: "If there are living beings practicing in another land, I will appear among them and preach to them the supreme Law." It also states: "[If they fall into the evil paths... I will] preach to them the sufferings of hell."

If the Buddha did not possess the nine worlds, how could he appear in "another land" or preach about "the sufferings of hell"? He does not merely describe hell from a distance; he manifests within it to save beings.

In the pre-Lotus Sutra teachings (*nizen-kyo*), it was taught that the Buddha had "cut off" (*danzetsu*) the nine worlds to attain purity. But in the *Lotus Sutra*, the Buddha reveals that he retains the nine worlds. He does not cut them off (*fudan*); rather, he uses the nine worlds as **Skillful Means** (*hōben*). This is why a Buddha can be angry (World of Anger) to chastise evil, or sorrowful (World of Bodhisattva/Compassion) to weep for the suffering of beings.

If he did not possess these worlds, he would be like a stone or a tree—incapable of relating to sentient life. Thus, the Mutual Possession of the Ten Worlds (*Jikkai Gogu*) is the inescapable logic of salvation.

### Section 6: The Object of Devotion (The Visual Mandala)

**The Form of the Object of Devotion:**

The fundamental form of this Object of Devotion is that of the Original Teacher in the "Ceremony in the Air." Above the *Saha* world, the Treasure Tower hangs suspended in the sky. To the left and right of the **Myoho Renge Kyo** in the center of the tower are Shakyamuni Buddha and Many Treasures Buddha.

The Four Bodhisattvas, including Superior Practices (*Jōgyō*), who attend Shakyamuni Buddha, occupy the higher seats. Bodhisattvas such as Manjushri and Maitreya are positioned in the lower seats as retainers of those Four Bodhisattvas.[^9]

The various bodhisattvas of the provisional teachings from other worlds, whether of greater or lesser stature, are placed upon the ground of the common people, looking up at the high nobility in the clouds like ministers gazing at the moon. The Buddhas of the ten directions are also placed upon the ground, manifesting that they are merely theoretical manifestations (*shaku-butsu*) and lands.

---
[^9]: **The Hierarchy of the Mandala:** This description overturns traditional Mahayana hierarchies.
    *   **Higher Seats:** The **Bodhisattvas of the Earth** (Superior Practices, etc.). They represent the specific teaching for the Latter Day.
    *   **Lower Seats:** The **Theoretical Bodhisattvas** (Manjushri, Maitreya, etc.). Even though they are the "stars" of standard Mahayana, here they are subordinate because they belong to the Theoretical Teaching (*Shakumon*) and lack the karma to suffer/save in the Latter Day. They are "retainers" to the Earth Bodhisattvas.

### Section 7: Transmission (The Secret Setlist)

**Question:** If this doctrine is so profound, why was it not entrusted to the great saints of the past?

**Answer:** This Dharma-gate of "One Moment, Three Thousand" was not entrusted even to bodhisattvas of wisdom and virtuous practice such as Manjushri or Maitreya. How much less, then, was it entrusted to any of the bodhisattvas of lower rank.

No—it was exclusively conferred upon the **Great Bodhisattvas of the Earth** (*Jiyū no Bosatsu*), led by Superior Practices (*Jōgyō*), whose number equals the dust-motes of a thousand worlds.

And why was this? Because these are the disciples—distant in time yet intimate in fundamental practice—of the Original Teacher. The Theoretical Bodhisattvas (Manjushri, etc.) learned from the Historical Buddha; the Earth Bodhisattvas learned from the Eternal Buddha in the infinite past. They alone share the life-blood (*myyaku*) of the Buddha’s enlightenment.[^10]

Know this: The Saha World of this present age, having transcended the three calamities and emerged from the four kalpas, is itself the eternal and tranquil Pure Land. It is here, within this very world, that the Dharma-gate of "One Moment, Three Thousand" is to be rinsed out (*furisusugu*) and propagated.

---
[^10]: **Why Manjushri was Bypassed:** Manjushri represents "Theoretical Wisdom." In the Latter Day of the Law (*Mappo*), theoretical wisdom is insufficient to save beings who are heavily burdened by karma. Only the "Original Disciples" (*Hon-deshi*), who possess the "Original Practice" (*Hon-gyō*)—which is the chanting of Nam-Myoho-Renge-Kyo—have the karmic capacity to function in this defiled age.
