## Confidence Score: 8/10

The interpretation successfully captures the core doctrinal essence, urgent tone, and central metaphor of Nichiren's treatise. It is a creative and generally accurate adaptation, not a literal translation. Most "errors" are intentional stylistic choices or simplifications inherent to the genre.

## Issues Found

| # | Location | Issue Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | The Promise | Doctrinal Nuance | "Guaranteed" may oversimplify—Nichiren emphasizes faith + practice + study. |
| 2 | It's All Inside You | Doctrinal Risk | Could be misread as rejecting the Gohonzon (external object of devotion). |
| 3 | Title/Header | Citation | Should specify original treatise name (*Isshō Jōbutsu Shō*). |
| 4 | Polish the Mirror | Logical Tension | "Ordinary folks *are* enlightenment" + "don't look outside" creates confusion. |
| 5 | Mystery of the Rhythm | Minor Translation | *Kyō* as "song of life" loses sūtra = teaching nuance. |
| 6 | Throughout | Terminology | Interchanging "Myoho-renge-kyo" and "Nam-myoho-renge-kyo" without clarification. |
