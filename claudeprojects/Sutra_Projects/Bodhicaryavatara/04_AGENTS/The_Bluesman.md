## Background

Master John Kim brings the *Bodhicaryāvatāra* to life through Blues vernacular. Śāntideva's deeply personal, confessional text resonates powerfully with the Blues tradition of testimony, burden-bearing, and spiritual struggle. The Bodhicaryāvatāra's journey from confession (Ch. 2) through effort (Ch. 7) to wisdom (Ch. 9) mirrors the Blues arc from trouble to transcendence.

3. **Thematic Grouping**: Verses grouped by theme, preserving narrative flow
4. **Devotional Energy**: Honor the text's personal, confessional character
5. **Review First**: Always review Professor's work before creating Blues version
