## Verse-by-Verse Audit (Sample)

### Verse 1
- **Confidence Score**: 7/10
- **Issues**:
  - **Over-translation**: "spiritual heirs" for *sasutān* ("with sons") adds interpretive layer
  - **Over-translation**: "entry into the discipline" for *saṃvarāvatāra* ("descent into vow")
- **Recommended**: "I shall set forth... the descent into the vow of the Sugata's offspring"

### Verse 2
- **Confidence Score**: 6/10
- **Issues**:
  - **Over-translation**: "cultivate my own mind" for *svamano vāsayituṃ* (more literally: "to satisfy/perfume my own mind")
  - *Vāsayitum* relates to *vāsanā* (habituation/perfuming)—not simply "cultivation"
- **Recommended**: "I have composed this merely to delight/satisfy my own mind"

### Verse 3
- **Confidence Score**: 8/10
- **Issues**:
  - Minor: "similar disposition" for *matsamadhātu* ("of the same nature/temperament as me")—acceptable paraphrase

### Verse 4
- **Confidence Score**: 9/10
- **Issues**:
  - Excellent rendering of *kṣaṇasaṃpad* and urgency

### Verse 5
- **Confidence Score**: 9/10
- **Issues**:
  - Excellent preservation of lightning metaphor
  - Minor: "meritorious actions" for *puṇyeṣu* ("toward merits")—slightly more active than source

### Verse 6
- **Confidence Score**: 7/10
- **Issues**:
  - **Over-translation**: "supreme awakening mind" for *saṃbodhicitta*—"complete awakening mind" or just "bodhicitta" is more precise
  - *Sughoram* ("exceedingly terrible") well captured

### Verse 7
- **Confidence Score**: 7/10
- **Issues**:
  - **Softening**: *utplāvayati* ("causes to overflow/flood") rendered as "overflow with joy"—acceptable but loses hydraulic force
  - **Minor ghost**: *apramitāñjanaughān* ("immeasurable floods of beings")—"multitudes" loses the flood imagery

### Verse 8
- **Confidence Score**: 9/10
- **Issues**:
  - Excellent triadic structure preserved
  - *Sattvavyasana* ("afflictions of beings") rendered as "miseries"—acceptable

### Verse 9
- **Confidence Score**: 8/10
- **Issues**:
  - *Bhavacārakabandhana* ("bound as a wanderer in becoming") well captured
  - *Varāka* ("wretched one") preserved

### Verse 10
- **Confidence Score**: 6/10
- **Issues**:
  - **Over-translation**: "it transforms it" introduces unspecified agent
  - **Softening**: *vedhanīya* ("to be penetrated/transmuted") rendered as "to be thoroughly refined"
  - *Rasajāta* (alchemical extract/elixir) partially captured
- **Recommended**: "Firmly grasp this designation 'bodhicitta'—like a transmutative elixir to be penetrated"

## Recommendations

### For Future Revisions

1. **Tighten Technical Terms**:
   - *saṃvara* → "vow" not "discipline"
   - *vāsayitum* → "to perfume/satisfy" not "cultivate"
   - *saṃbodhicitta* → "complete awakening mind" or just "bodhicitta"

2. **Preserve Vivid Imagery**:
   - *utplāvayati* → "floods/inundates" (hydraulic metaphor)
   - *vedhanīya* → "to be penetrated" (alchemical metaphor)
   - *janaughān* → "floods of beings" (not just "multitudes")

3. **Reduce Interpretive Additions**:
   - "spiritual heirs" → "sons/children"
   - "supreme" (when not in source) → omit

## Final Verdict

| Aspect | Score |
|:-------|:------|
| **Overall Fidelity** | 7.5/10 |
| **Scholarly Value** | 8.5/10 |
| **Blues Adaptation Readiness** | 9/10 |

**Conclusion**: This is a **reliable and eloquent interpretive translation**. For maximum philological fidelity in a critical or commentary-focused edition, a revision tightening key technical terms and adhering more strictly to the literal imagery would be beneficial. The translation excels in conveying the *spirit* but occasionally sacrifices some *letter* of the text for readability.

**Action Required**: Minor—no critical errors. Recommended for Blues adaptation as-is, with noted technical terms highlighted for Bluesman review.

## Chapter 9: Prajñāpāramitā (Wisdom) - RE-AUDIT

**Audit Date**: 2026-01-02 (Post-Revision)
**Confidence Score**: 9.5/10
**Verdict**: **ACCEPT**

| Issue Type | Finding | Resolution |
|:-----------|:--------|:-----------|
| **Doctrinal Clarity** | Previous "compression" of Cittamātra critique (vv. 59-90). | **RESOLVED**. Added "The Mind-Only Trap" note detailing the "Sword Argument" and *svasaṃvedana* critique. |
| **Context** | Lack of connection to wider Mahayana context. | **RESOLVED**. Added "Saturday Night vs. Sunday Morning" note contrasting with Lotus Sutra. |

**Final Assessment**: The addition of the "Mind-Only Trap" note successfully unpacks the dense philosophical argumentation of verses 59-90 without burdening the vernacular verses. The comparative note adds significant hermeneutical value. The chapter is now publication-ready.

**Auditor**: DeepSeek Reasoner
