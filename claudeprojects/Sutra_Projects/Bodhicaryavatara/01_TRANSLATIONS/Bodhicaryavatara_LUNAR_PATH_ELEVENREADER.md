# The Lunar Path: Bodhicaryāvatāra

## A 28-Day Liturgical Cycle


This text is arranged for daily recitation over the course of one sidereal lunar month (27 days), with a final day of silence.


## Day 1: Ignition (Chapter 1, Verses 1-36)

oṃ namo buddhāya

 Having reverently bowed to the Sugatas together with their spiritual heirs, to those endowed with the Dharmakāya, and to all who are worthy of veneration, I shall set forth, in accordance with scripture and in brief, the descent into the vow of the offspring of the Sugatas.

There is nothing new to be said here, nor do I possess any skill in literary composition. Therefore, I have no thought for the benefit of others—I have composed this merely to perfume my own mind.

For me, at least, through this work the momentum of faith for cultivating virtue increases. And should another of similar disposition see this, then it too may prove beneficial.

: The urgency of the precious human life—"How will such a conjunction come again?"
2.

: Lightning in darkness—beauty and terror of rare clarity
3.

Thus virtue is always weak, while the power of negativity is vast and exceedingly terrible. By what other virtue could it be conquered, were it not for the complete awakening mind?

The Lords of Sages, contemplating for countless aeons, have seen this alone to be beneficial: through it, happiness, having easily increased, causes immeasurable floods of beings to overflow with joy.

For those who wish to cross over the hundreds of sufferings of existence, for those who wish to remove the miseries of sentient beings, for those who wish to experience hundreds of happinesses—bodhicitta must never be abandoned.

: The prisoner who becomes heir to the throne—radical transformation
4.

Taking hold of this impure form, it transforms it into the priceless image of the Victor's jewel. Grasp firmly this elixir known as bodhicitta, which is to be penetrated.

Thoroughly examined by those of immeasurable wisdom, the sole caravan leaders of the world, and found to be of great value—you who are disposed to wander from destination to destination, grasp firmly this jewel of bodhicitta.

Like the plantain tree that perishes after bearing fruit, all other virtues decay and are exhausted. But the tree of bodhicitta continually bears fruit and, never depleted, only grows.

Though one has committed terrible misdeeds, one crosses beyond them instantly through reliance upon it—just as one escapes great dangers through reliance upon a hero. Why then is it not embraced by those who are ignorant?

Like the fire at the end of an aeon, it incinerates great misdeeds in an instant. Its immeasurable benefits Lord Maitreya declared to the wise Sudhana.

That bodhicitta is to be understood, in brief, as twofold: the mind of aspiration to awakening and the mind of venturing forth toward awakening.

Just as the distinction is understood between one who wishes to go and one who is going, so too should the distinction between these two be understood by the wise, in that order.

Great is the fruit of the aspiring bodhicitta even in saṃsāra, yet it does not produce uninterrupted merit as does the mind that has set forth.

From the moment one takes up that mind with irreversible intention for the complete liberation of the limitless realm of sentient beings—

—from that moment onward, whether asleep or distracted, uninterrupted streams of merit, vast as space, continually pour forth.

The Tathāgata himself declared this, with supporting reasoning, in the Subāhupṛcchā, for the sake of beings inclined toward lesser aspirations.

One who, with a benevolent intention, thinks "I shall remove the headaches of beings"—such a one is grasped by immeasurable merit.

How much more so one who wishes to remove the incomparable suffering of each and every being, and who wishes to accomplish immeasurable qualities for each?

What mother or father has such benevolent intention? Do the gods, the ṛṣis, or the Brahmās possess it?

For those very beings, even this wish for their own benefit has never arisen before, even in dreams. How then could it arise for the sake of others?

How does this extraordinary jewel among beings arise—this intention for the benefit of others that does not arise even for their own benefit?

How can the merit of this jewel-mind—the seed of the world's joy, the medicine for the world's suffering—be measured?

Merely by aspiring for the benefit of others, one's worship of the Buddha is surpassed. How much more so by striving for the complete happiness of all beings?

Desiring to escape from suffering, they run toward suffering itself. With the very desire for happiness, out of delusion they destroy their own happiness as if it were an enemy.

For those who are starved for happiness and afflicted in so many ways—the bodhisattva satisfies them with all happinesses and cuts off all their afflictions.

Such a one destroys even delusion. Where is there another equally good? Where is there such a friend, such merit?

One who returns a favor is praised. What then need be said of the bodhisattva, who acts beneficently without expectation?

One who gives a meal to a few people—doing so contemptuously, providing mere sustenance for half a day—is honored by people as one who has done a virtuous deed.

How much more so one who, for an immeasurable multitude of beings, throughout limitless time, bestows the inexhaustible fulfillment of all wishes—for beings as numerous as the reaches of space?

Concerning such a lord of the feast, a child of the Victor: whosoever engenders hostility in their heart, they shall dwell in the hells for as many aeons as the moments of hostility—so the Lord declared.

But one whose mind attains faith—the fruit produced thereby exceeds even that. For negativity requires great force against the children of the Victors, while virtue arises effortlessly.

: Taking refuge in those who transform harm into happiness—finding home


---

## Day 2: The Burden (Chapter 2, Verses 1-33)

In order to properly take hold of that jewel-mind, I make offerings to the Tathāgatas, to the stainless jewel of the true Dharma, and to the offspring of the Buddhas, those oceans of virtue.

As many flowers and fruits as there are, as many medicinal herbs as exist, as many jewels as are found in the world, and waters clear and delightful—

—mountains made of precious gems and others too, forest regions lovely in their solitude, vines radiant with ornaments of blossoms, and trees with branches bent low with excellent fruit—

—in the realms of gods and other beings, fragrant incense, wish-fulfilling trees and jewel-trees, lakes adorned with lotuses, enchanting with the calls of swans—

—crops that grow without cultivation and all other adornments worthy of offering, extending to the very limits of space—all these, which belong to no one—

—these I take up mentally and present to the supreme Sages together with their spiritual heirs. May those supremely worthy of gifts, great in compassion, accept these from me out of kindness.

I am devoid of merit, utterly destitute. I have nothing else to offer. Therefore, O Protectors, for my sake—you who are intent on the welfare of others—accept this by your own power.

: Total self-surrender—"I give myself entirely"
2.

Through your acceptance of me, I become fearless in existence and work for the welfare of beings. I transcend my former misdeeds, and I commit no further transgressions.

In bathing chambers that are fragrant, with floors of shining crystal, with canopies brilliant with radiant pearls, upon pillars sparkling with gems and delightful to the mind—

—there, with many great jeweled vessels filled with pleasing scented water and flowers, I bathe the Tathāgatas and their spiritual heirs, accompanied by songs and music.

I dry their bodies with incomparable cloths, scented and stainless; then I present to them excellent robes, well-dyed and well-perfumed.

With divine garments, soft, smooth, and of various splendor, and with the finest ornaments, I adorn Samantabhadra, Mañjughoṣa, Avalokiteśvara, and the rest.

With the supreme fragrances whose scent pervades a billion worlds, I anoint the bodies of all the Lords of Sages, gleaming like refined, polished, burnished gold.

With māndārava blossoms, blue lotuses, jasmine, and all sweet-smelling, delightful flowers, I worship the Lords of Sages, most worthy of worship, with garlands arranged in beautiful forms.

I envelop them with clouds of incense, rich and spreading with delightful fragrance. I present to them offerings of various foods—things to eat, to chew, and to drink.

I present jeweled lamps arranged in rows upon golden lotuses, and upon floors anointed with fragrance I scatter lovely heaps of flowers.

To those who are made of loving-kindness, I present celestial mansions radiant with beautiful strings of pearls and gems, adorning the directions, delightful with songs of praise.

I hold aloft for the Great Sages, exceedingly beautiful, jeweled parasols with golden handles of lovely form, set with pearls.

Henceforth, may delightful clouds of offerings arise, clouds of musical instruments and songs that bring joy to all beings.

And upon all the jewels of the true Dharma, upon stūpas and sacred images, may rains of flowers and gems and other offerings fall continuously.

Just as Mañjughoṣa and the others worship the Victors, so too do I worship the Tathāgatas, those Protectors, together with their spiritual heirs.

With oceans of melodious verses I praise those oceans of virtue. May clouds of hymns and songs arise before them, without fail.

With prostrations as numerous as the atoms in all buddha-fields, I bow down to all Buddhas of the three times, together with the Dharma and the sublime Saṅgha.

I venerate all stūpas and likewise the abodes of bodhisattvas. I pay homage to preceptors and to those practitioners worthy of veneration.

I go for refuge to the Buddha until the seat of awakening. I go for refuge to the Dharma, and likewise to the assembly of bodhisattvas.

With palms joined, I make known to the fully awakened Buddhas abiding in all directions, and to the greatly compassionate bodhisattvas:

Throughout beginningless saṃsāra, in this very life and in others, whatever transgression has been committed by me, a beast, or caused to be committed by me—

—and whatever I have foolishly rejoiced in, to my own destruction—that transgression I confess, tormented by remorse.

Whatever offense I have committed through body, speech, or mind against the Triple Gem, against mother and father, or against other teachers, out of contempt—

—whatever terrible transgression has been done by me, a sinner afflicted with many faults—all that I confess, O Leaders.

How shall I escape from this? Rescue me quickly! May death not come swiftly upon me while my transgressions remain unexhausted.


---

## Day 3: Refuge (Chapter 2, Verses 34-65)

This death—this assassin of trust—does not examine what has been done and what is left undone. Whether healthy or sick, it is not to be trusted. It is a sudden great thunderbolt.

For the sake of the beloved and the unloved alike, I have committed many transgressions. Yet I did not recognize that everything must be abandoned and I must depart.

: Existential dissolution—"nothing at all will exist"
4.

Everything that is experienced becomes a mere memory. Like something experienced in a dream, everything passes and is not seen again.

Even as I stand here now, many loved and unloved ones have departed. But the terrible transgression committed on their account remains before me.

I did not consider that "I am merely a visitor." Through delusion, attachment, and aversion, I have committed many transgressions.

Day and night, without rest, life is constantly diminishing. There is no replenishment for what is lost. Shall I not die?

Though lying here on my bed, though surrounded by relatives, the pain of the cutting of the vital parts must be endured by me alone.

When seized by the messengers of Yama, where is relative, where is friend? Merit alone is protection then—and that I have not cultivated.

Attached to this impermanent life, not knowing this danger, I—in my heedlessness, O Protectors—have accumulated much transgression.

Even one being led away today for the amputation of a limb grows faint: parched with thirst, with pitiful gaze, seeing the world differently.

How much more so one who is overcome by the terrifying messengers of Yama, seized by great fever of terror, smeared with excrement?

Searching for protection in the four directions with anguished glances, "Who will be the good one who will protect me from this great fear?"

Seeing the directions devoid of protection, I shall fall again into confusion. What then shall I do in that place of great terror?

This very day I go for refuge to the mighty Lords of the World, to the Victors who strive for the protection of the world, who remove all fear.

And the Dharma that they have realized, which destroys the fear of saṃsāra—I go for refuge to it genuinely, and likewise to the assembly of bodhisattvas.

Trembling with fear, I give myself to Samantabhadra; and again, of my own accord, I give myself to Mañjughoṣa.

: Anguished cry—"Terrified, I cry out"
6.

To the noble Ākāśagarbha, to Kṣitigarbha, and genuinely to all the greatly compassionate ones—searching for protection, I cry out.

I bow to the Vajra-holder, at the sight of whom the wicked messengers of Yama and other evil ones flee in terror in the four directions.

Having transgressed your words before, now, seeing this danger, I go to you for refuge in fear. Remove my fear quickly!

Even one frightened by a passing illness would not transgress the physician's instructions. How much less one afflicted by the four hundred and four diseases?

By even one of these, all people in Jambudvīpa perish, and a remedy for them is not found in any direction.

If I would transgress the words of the physician who knows all, who removes all afflictions—shame on me, so utterly deluded!

I stand with great care even at other, lesser precipices. How much more at this precipice of a thousand leagues, lasting for eons?

It is not right for me to sit at ease thinking, "Death will not come today." Inevitably the time shall come when I shall not exist.

Who has given me fearlessness? How shall I escape? I shall certainly not exist. Why then is my mind at ease?

What essence remains for me from previous experiences, now vanished? Yet, attached to them, I have transgressed the words of teachers.

: Going alone somewhere—"I shall go alone"
7.

Rather, this alone should be my concern, day and night: "How shall I escape from the suffering that will certainly arise from transgression?"

Whatever transgression has been accumulated by me, a fool and a dullard—whether an offense by nature or an offense by precept—

—all that I confess, standing before the Protectors with palms joined, terrified of suffering, bowing again and again.


---

## Day 4: The Vow (Chapter 3, Verses 1-33)

I rejoice with joy in the virtue done by all beings—virtue that brings respite from the sufferings of the lower realms. May those who suffer abide in happiness!

I rejoice in the liberation of embodied beings from the suffering of saṃsāra. I rejoice in the bodhisattvahood and buddhahood of those Protectors.

I rejoice in the teachers' oceans of bodhicitta that bring happiness to all beings, and in their establishment of benefit for all sentient beings.

With palms joined, I entreat the fully awakened ones in all directions: may they kindle the lamp of Dharma for those who, through delusion, fall headlong into suffering.

With palms joined, I beseech the Victors who wish to pass into nirvāṇa: may they remain for countless aeons, so that this world does not become blind.

Having done all this, may I, through whatever virtue I have accumulated, become one who completely pacifies all the suffering of all beings.

: Medicine, physician, and nurse—total healing
2.

May I quench the torment of hunger and thirst with showers of food and drink. In the intermediate aeons of famine, may I become food and drink.

For destitute beings, may I become an inexhaustible treasury. May I attend upon them in various forms as requisites.

This very self, my enjoyments, and all my virtue of the three times—all this I give away without attachment, for the accomplishment of the welfare of all beings.

The complete relinquishment of all is nirvāṇa, and my mind seeks nirvāṇa. If all must be given up by me, it is better that it be given to sentient beings.

I have rendered this self for the happiness of all embodied beings. Let them always kill me, revile me, and shower me with dust.

Let them play with my body, let them laugh at me and mock me. My body has been given to them—what use is this concern of mine for it?

Let them make me perform whatever actions bring them happiness. May no harm ever come to anyone on my account.

If their attitude toward me, whether angry or pleased, becomes a cause for the constant fulfillment of all their aims—

—those who slander me, and others too who harm me, and likewise those who mock me—may they all share in awakening.

: Protector, guide, boat, bridge—being everything for everybody
4.

May I be a lamp for those who need a lamp, a bed for those who need a bed. May I be a servant for all embodied beings who need a servant.

May I become a wish-fulfilling gem, an excellent vase, a powerful mantra, a great medicine. May I become a wish-granting tree and a wish-fulfilling cow for beings.

Just as the elements such as earth and the rest are enjoyed in various ways by innumerable beings extending to the limits of space—

—so may I be a source of sustenance, in various ways, for the realm of beings extending to the limits of space, until all have attained nirvāṇa.

Just as the Sugatas of old embraced bodhicitta, just as they progressively trained in the bodhisattva trainings—

—so too do I generate bodhicitta for the welfare of the world, and likewise shall I train in those trainings in their proper sequence.

Having thus wisely taken hold of bodhicitta with devotion, one should gladden the mind in order to strengthen what has been embraced:

: "Today my birth has become fruitful!"—the moment of transformation
5.

Henceforth I must perform the actions befitting those of my own family, so that no stain will come upon this pure family.

: Blind person finding a jewel in garbage—the unlikely gift

This elixir has arisen to destroy the death of the world. This is the inexhaustible treasury that quells the poverty of the world.

This is the supreme medicine that pacifies the disease of the world. This is the tree of rest for beings exhausted from wandering on the paths of existence.

This is the public bridge for crossing out of the lower realms. This is the moon of mind that has risen to pacify the afflictions of the world.

This is the great sun that dispels the darkness of the world's ignorance. This is the fresh butter produced from churning the milk of the true Dharma.

For the caravan of beings traveling the paths of existence, who hunger and thirst for enjoyment of happiness—this feast of happiness has arrived, to satisfy all beings who have come as guests.

Today, in the presence of all the Protectors, I invite the world to Sugatahood and, in the meantime, to happiness. May gods, asuras, and all others rejoice!


---

## Day 5: Care (Chapter 4, Verses 1-24)

Having thus firmly taken hold of bodhicitta, a child of the Victors should always make effort, without laziness, not to transgress the trainings.

Whatever is undertaken hastily, whatever is not properly considered—regarding these it is fitting to say "I may or may not do this." Even after making a promise, this is appropriate.

But that which has been examined by the Buddhas and their offspring of great wisdom, and by me too according to my ability—in that matter, why should I delay?

If, having promised thus, I do not accomplish it through action, then having deceived all these beings, what destiny will be mine?

It is said that one who, even after merely thinking of giving, does not give, becomes a hungry ghost—even over a trifling thing.

How much more so one who, having sincerely proclaimed supreme happiness with a loud voice, deceives the entire world—what destiny will be mine?

The Omniscient One alone knows this inconceivable course of karma: that even one who abandons bodhicitta, he liberates such a one.

Therefore, for a bodhisattva, every downfall is exceedingly serious, for when he falls, he causes harm to the welfare of all beings.

And whoever else creates, even for a moment, an obstacle to his merit—there is no end to that one's lower rebirths, since he has destroyed the welfare of beings.

If one would be destroyed by destroying the welfare of even a single being, how much more by destroying the welfare of embodied beings throughout the expanse of space?

Thus, oscillating in saṃsāra through the force of downfalls and the force of bodhicitta, one is long delayed in attaining the stages.

: "From depth to depth"—the falling image
2.

Immeasurable Buddhas have passed, seekers of all beings, but through my own faults I did not come into the range of their healing.

And if today I remain just as before, I shall again and again obtain lower rebirths, disease, death, cutting, splitting, and the rest.

When shall I obtain—so exceedingly difficult to obtain—the arising of a Tathāgata, faith, human existence, and fitness for cultivating virtue?

This day of health, with food, without calamity—life is a fleeting moment, deceptive. The body is like something borrowed.

Through such conduct of mine, human existence is not obtained again. When human existence is not obtained, there is only evil—whence virtue?

If I do not perform virtue even when fit for virtue, what shall I do when bewildered by the sufferings of the lower realms?

When one does not perform virtue and only accumulates evil, the very word "higher rebirth" is destroyed for hundreds of millions of aeons.

Therefore the Blessed One said that human life is exceedingly difficult to obtain—like a turtle putting its neck through the hole of a yoke floating on the great ocean.

For evil committed in a single moment one dwells in Avīci for an aeon. What talk then of higher rebirth when evil has been accumulated since beginningless time?

And having experienced just that, one is not freed. For while experiencing that, one gives birth to further evil.

There is no greater deception than this, there is no greater delusion than this: that having obtained such a moment, I have not practiced virtue.

If I reflect thus and yet fall again into confusion, I shall lament for a long time, tormented by the messengers of Yama.


---

## Day 6: Vigilance (Chapter 4, Verses 25-48)

For a long time the unbearable fire of hell will burn my body. For a long time the fire of remorse will burn my untrained mind.

Somehow I have reached this beneficial ground, so difficult to reach, yet knowingly I am being led again to those same hells.

: "Who is it that dwells within me?"—the mystery of mental bondage
3.

: "No hands, no feet...how did they enslave me?"—the pathos
4.

Stationed in my very mind, they strike at me at their ease. Yet even at that I do not become angry—shame on my misplaced patience!

If all the gods and all humans were my enemies, even they could not lead me to the fire of Avīci.

These powerful enemies, the afflictions, throw me there in an instant—where, if even Mount Meru met it, not even ashes would be found.

The lifespan of no other enemy is as long as this—beginningless and endless, as long as the great duration of my affliction-enemies.

All others, if served agreeably, work for my benefit. But these afflictions, when served, only cause me more suffering.

Thus, while constant, long-lasting enemies—sole causes of flooding torrents of misfortune—dwell in my heart, how can I dwell fearlessly enjoying saṃsāra with delight?

These are the jailers of the prison of existence, the executioners even in the hells. If they dwell in the cage of craving within my mental home, how can there be happiness for me?

Therefore I shall not lay down this burden until these enemies are slain before my eyes. Even regarding a minor offender, the proud, bound in anger, do not sleep until they have struck him down.

On the battlefield, striving fiercely to strike down natural enemies who are subject to the suffering of mortality anyway, men do not turn back, ignoring the pain of arrows and spears.

How much less should I be subject to depression and despair now, being engaged in striking down the natural enemies that are the constant causes of all suffering, even by hundreds of misfortunes?

People display upon their bodies the wounds inflicted by enemies without reason, like ornaments. Why then should sufferings hinder me, engaged in accomplishing a great goal?

Fishermen, outcasts, farmers, and the like, their minds fixed on merely their own livelihood, endure hardships of cold, heat, and so forth. Why do I not endure for the sake of the world's welfare?

Having vowed to liberate beings throughout space extending to the ten directions from afflictions, I have not even freed myself from afflictions.

Speaking like that without knowing my own measure, was I not a madman then? Therefore I shall never turn back from destroying afflictions.

In this I shall be grasping, bound in enmity, a combatant—except for that affliction that is connected with destroying afflictions.

: "Let my entrails spill out"—ultimate commitment
6.

An exiled enemy may find a foothold in another land, from where, having regained his strength, he returns. But the course of the affliction-enemy is not like this.

Expelled from my mind, where would he go? Where would he stay while contriving to destroy me? I simply lack effort—wretched are the afflictions, they are conquered through the eye of wisdom.

: "This is mere illusion"—the liberating truth

Having determined thus, I make effort for the accomplishment of the trainings as taught. How can one whose illness is curable by a physician's instructions become healthy if he strays from them?


---

## Day 7: Mindfulness (Chapter 5, Verses 1-36)

One who wishes to guard the training must diligently guard the mind. It is impossible to guard the training if one does not guard the wandering mind.

Uncontrolled, maddened elephants do not cause as much harm in this world as is caused by the mind-elephant let loose in Avīci and elsewhere.

If the mind-elephant is bound on all sides by the rope of mindfulness, all fear disappears and all good comes near.

For the Teacher of Truth has said that all fears and immeasurable sufferings arise from the mind itself.

By whom were the weapons of hell forged with such effort? By whom was the floor of heated iron made? Whence came those women?

The Sage declared that all such things arise from the sinful mind. Therefore there is nothing more terrifying in the three worlds than the mind.

If the perfection of generosity consisted of making the world free from poverty, then since the world is still poor, how did the former Protectors perfect it?

The perfection of generosity is said to be the mind of giving away all things to all beings, together with the fruit of that. Therefore, it is the mind itself.

Where can fish and the like be led so that I will not kill them? When the mind of renunciation is obtained, that is considered the perfection of ethics.

How many wicked people, limitless as the sky, can I kill? When the mind of anger is killed, all enemies are killed.

Where would there be leather to cover the entire earth? The earth is covered with leather merely by the leather of my sandals.

Similarly, I am unable to restrain external things. I shall restrain my own mind. What is the use of restraining other things?

Even accompanied by speech and body, a mind of weak application does not produce results like those of the sharp mind alone—even to the state of Brahmā.

The Omniscient One said that all recitations and austerities, though performed for a long time, are simply pointless if the mind is directed elsewhere, distracted.

Those who have not cultivated this mind—the secret essence of all Dharma—wander pointlessly in space, seeking to destroy suffering and attain happiness.

Therefore I must keep my mind well-placed and well-guarded. Apart from the vow of guarding the mind, what use are many vows to me?

Just as one in the midst of an unruly crowd carefully protects a wound, so one in the midst of bad company should always protect the wound of the mind.

Fearing a little pain from a wound, I protect the wound carefully. Fearing the crushing of the Hell-Mountains, why do I not protect the wound of the mind?

Living in this way, even among wicked people, even among attractive people, the steadfast practitioner is not shattered.

: "Let everything be lost—but never the mind"
4.

I make this entreaty to those who wish to guard the mind: guard mindfulness and introspection with every effort.

Just as a person afflicted by illness is unfit for all work, so too a mind impaired by these two is unfit for all work.

What is learned, contemplated, and meditated upon does not remain in memory—like water in a leaky pot—for one whose mind lacks introspection.

Even many who are learned, faithful, and diligent become stained with downfalls through the fault of lacking introspection.

Robbed by the thief of non-introspection, who follows after the theft of mindfulness, even those who have accumulated merit go to lower realms.

This gang of affliction-thieves seeks an opportunity. Having found the opportunity, they rob us and destroy the life of higher rebirth.

Therefore, never let mindfulness depart from the door of the mind. If it has gone, recall it by remembering the suffering of the lower realms.

For the fortunate who dwell with teachers, who are respectful through fear and instruction, mindfulness arises easily.

The Buddhas and bodhisattvas have unobstructed vision everywhere. Everything is before them. I stand before them.

Reflecting thus, one should abide in modesty, respect, and fear. Recollection of the Buddha will occur to such a one again and again.

When mindfulness stands at the door of the mind for the purpose of guarding it, then introspection arrives, and once it has come, it does not go again.

First, the mind should always be kept ready thus: "I must remain as if without senses, like a log."

Fruitless glances should never be made. The gaze should always be cast downward, as if in meditation.

For the sake of resting the eyes, one may occasionally look at the horizon. And seeing a mere appearance, one may look to acknowledge someone's presence.


---

## Day 8: Discipline (Chapter 5, Verses 37-72)

On a path, for awareness of danger, one may look repeatedly in the four directions. Having rested, one should look behind by turning.

Having looked ahead and behind, one should go forward or back. Thus in all situations one should act having understood what is to be done.

Having determined "The body should remain thus," and having undertaken the action, one should look again in between: "How is the body positioned?"

Thus, with all effort, one should observe whether the mind-elephant is bound to the great pillar of the Dharma meditation.

Thus the mind should be examined: "Where is my mind engaged?" And one should not abandon even for a moment the yoke of concentration.

If one is unable to do this when connected with danger or celebration, one may act as one wishes. But at the time of giving, disregard of ethics is taught.

Having understood a task and set about it, one should not think of anything else. That task should be accomplished first, with the inner self intent upon it.

Thus everything is well done. Otherwise, neither is accomplished, and the affliction of non-introspection grows.

One should destroy whatever curiosity arises regarding various kinds of gossip and the many types of entertainment.

When fruitless activities arise—playing with earth, tearing grass, drawing lines—remembering the Tathāgata's training, one should abandon them immediately, with fear.

Whenever one wishes to move or wishes to speak, one should first examine one's own mind, then act with steadiness and skill.

When one sees that one's own mind is attached or hostile, one should not act, one should not speak—one should remain like a log.

When the mind seeks gain, honor, renown, or seeks a following, or seeks service for myself—therefore I stand like a log.

When the mind is indifferent to others' welfare, seeks one's own profit, or wishes to speak in an assembly—therefore I stand like a log.

When the mind is impatient, lazy, fearful, impudent, garrulous, or attached to one's own faction—therefore I stand like a log.

Seeing the mind thus afflicted or engaged in fruitless activity, the hero should always firmly restrain it with the antidote.

Well-determined, serene, steady, respectful, modest, fearful of wrong, peaceful, intent on pleasing others.

Unwearied by the conflicting desires of childish beings, compassionate, knowing "This arises from affliction in them."

I shall hold the mind always under the power of myself and all beings, directed toward blameless objects, like a magical creation, without ego.

Again and again recalling that the excellent moment was attained after so long, I shall hold the mind thus—immovable as Mount Meru.

Dragged here and there by vultures greedy for flesh, the body makes no resistance. Why then do you take action on its behalf?

Mind, why do you guard this body, making it your own and becoming arrogant? If it is different from you, what loss is it to you?

You fool! You do not claim a clean wooden doll. Why do you guard this foul machine constructed of filth?

First, with your own intellect, separate this bag of skin. Then, with the sword of wisdom, detach the flesh from the skeleton.

Having separated even the bones, look at the marrow within. Consider for yourself: "What essence is there here?"

Having sought thus with effort, you have not found any essence. Now say why you still guard this body today.

You may not eat the impure flesh, you may not drink the blood, you may not suck the entrails—what will you do with the body?

It is fitting to guard it as food for vultures and jackals. But this body of humans is an instrument for action.

Yet even as you guard it, pitiless death will seize the body and give it to the vultures. What will you do then?

Thinking "He will not stay," one does not give clothes and such to a servant. The body will eat and go—why do you make the expenditure?

Having given it its wages, attend now to your own welfare. For not everything earned by the worker is given to him.

Regarding the body as a ship, on account of coming and going, make the body go as you wish for the accomplishment of beings' welfare.

: "Always have a smiling face"
6.

One should not throw down seats and such suddenly and noisily. One should not bang doors. One should always love silence.


---

## Day 9: Conduct (Chapter 5, Verses 73-109)

The crane, the cat, and the thief, moving silently and inconspicuously, accomplish their desired goals. The practitioner should always act thus.

One should accept with bowed head the words of those skilled in directing others, who help without being asked. One should always be everyone's student.

One should say "Well done!" to all that is well spoken. Seeing one who does merit, one should gladden them with praise.

One should speak of others' good qualities in private. When one's own qualities are spoken of, one should reflect that it is appreciation of those qualities.

All undertakings are for the sake of satisfaction, which is hard to obtain even with wealth. Therefore I shall enjoy the satisfaction that is the joy in others' good qualities produced by their efforts.

Here there is no loss for me, and great happiness in the next life. But through hostility there is the suffering of displeasure, and great suffering in the next life.

One should speak with trustworthy, well-placed words, with clear meaning, pleasant, delightful to hear, rooted in compassion, soft and gentle.

One should always look at beings directly, as if drinking them in with the eyes. "Depending on these alone, I shall attain buddhahood."

Great good arises from continuous, devoted practice toward the antidote, toward the field of good qualities and kindness, and toward the suffering.

One should be skillful, diligent, and always self-reliant. No opportunity should be given to anyone in any work.

The perfections—generosity and so forth—are progressively superior. One should not abandon a greater one for a lesser, except for the bridge of conduct.

Having understood thus, one should always be engaged in others' welfare. Even what is forbidden is permitted for the compassionate one who sees the benefit.

One should eat in moderation, sharing with those who have fallen, the unprotected, and those observing vows. One should give away everything except the three robes.

One should not harm the body that serves the true Dharma for trivial purposes. In this way alone one quickly fulfills the hopes of beings.

Therefore one should not give up one's life while one's compassionate intention is impure. But if the intention is equal, one should give it up. Thus there is no loss.

One should not teach Dharma to one who is disrespectful, who is healthy but wears a head covering, who carries an umbrella, staff, or weapon, or whose head is veiled.

One should not teach the profound and vast to those of lesser capacity. One should treat the lesser and the greater Dharmas with equal respect, without women, without a man.

One should not assign someone who is a vessel for the vast Dharma to the lesser Dharma. One should not attract them by forsaking conduct through sūtras and mantras.

The open ejection of toothsticks and phlegm is unwelcome. Urinating and such in usable water or on the ground is reprehensible.

One should not eat with a full mouth, noisily, or with mouth wide open. One should not sit with legs dangling, nor rub both arms together.

One should not travel, sleep, or sit alone with another's woman. Having seen and inquired what displeases people, one should avoid it.

One should not indicate anything with a finger, but respectfully with the right hand. One should point out the way with the whole hand in that manner.

One should not wave the arms about and make noise over a small matter. Snapping fingers and such should be done. Otherwise one is unrestrained.

One should lie down in the direction one wishes, like the Lord at nirvāṇa. Introspective, quick to rise—first, obligatorily, by vow.

The conduct of bodhisattvas is said to be immeasurable. One should certainly practice the conduct of purifying the mind.

Three times by day and three times by night one should recite the Three Sections. Through that, relying on bodhicitta and the Victors, remaining downfalls are pacified.

Whatever situations one encounters, whether by oneself or under others' power, one should train diligently in the trainings that apply to those situations.

There is nothing that should not be trained in by the children of the Victors. For one abiding thus, there is nothing that is not merit.

Directly or indirectly, one should do nothing except for the welfare of beings. And for the sake of beings alone, one should dedicate everything to awakening.

One should never abandon the spiritual friend, even for one's life—one who holds the bodhisattva vow, who is skilled in the meaning of the Mahāyāna.

One should learn the service to the teacher from the Śrīsaṃbhava-vimokṣa. This and other teachings of the Buddha are to be known from reading the sūtras.

The trainings are to be seen in the sūtras; therefore one should recite the sūtras. One should examine the root downfalls in the Ākāśagarbha-sūtra.

The Śikṣāsamuccaya must certainly be examined again and again, for daily conduct is extensively shown there.

Or, at least for the time being, see the Sūtrasamuccaya. And with effort, see the second one composed by the noble Nāgārjuna.

From that, seeing what is forbidden and what is enjoined, practice the training for the sake of protecting the mind of worldly beings.

This alone is the definition of introspection in brief: the repeated examination of the state of body and mind.

: "Read with my body"—embodied practice

## Day 10: Anger (Chapter 6, Verses 1-33)

All this excellent conduct—generosity, worship of the Sugatas—performed over thousands of aeons, a single moment of hatred destroys.

There is no evil equal to hatred, and no austerity equal to patience. Therefore one should cultivate patience diligently, through various methods.

The mind does not grasp peace, does not experience pleasure and happiness, does not find sleep or stability, when the thorn of hatred is lodged in the heart.

Even those whom one benefits with wealth and honors, who depend on one, wish to kill a lord who is miserable through hatred.

Even friends shrink from him. He gives but is not served. In short, there is nothing by which the angry person is well-situated.

Knowing thus that hatred creates such suffering—whoever destroys hatred steadfastly is happy here and hereafter.

Having obtained the food of mental distress from the obstruction of what is desired and from the occurrence of what is not desired, hatred grows arrogant and destroys me.

Therefore I shall destroy the food of that enemy. For that enemy has no other business than slaying me.

Even by the occurrence of the extremely undesirable, my cheerfulness should not be disturbed. Even in mental distress there is nothing wanted; and virtue deteriorates.

If there is a remedy, what use is grief about it? And if there is no remedy, what use is grief about it?

Suffering, contempt, harsh words, disgrace—these are unwished for by us and our dear ones; for our enemies, the opposite.

Happiness is obtained somehow with difficulty; suffering remains without effort. It is only through suffering that liberation is achieved. Therefore, mind, be steadfast!

The devotees of Durgā and the people of Karṇāṭa endure the pain of burning and cutting pointlessly, for the sake of liberation. Why then am I timid?

There is nothing that is difficult through practice. Therefore, through practice of mild discomfort, even great discomfort becomes bearable.

Do you not see as meaningless the discomfort of biting gnats and flies, hunger and thirst, and great suffering such as itching?

Cold, heat, rain, wind, illness, bondage, and blows—one should not be delicate about these. Otherwise discomfort increases.

Some, seeing their own blood, become even more courageous. But others, seeing even another's blood, fall into a faint.

This comes from firmness or timidity of mind. Therefore one should become unconquerable by suffering and should overcome discomfort.

Even in suffering, the wise one should not disturb the serenity of the mind. For there is battle with the afflictions, and in battle discomfort is easily obtained.

Those who, receiving the blows of enemies on their chests, conquer their enemies—they are the victorious heroes. The rest are merely corpse-slayers.

Another merit of suffering is that through disenchantment, pride falls away, compassion arises for those in saṃsāra, fear of evil, and longing for the Victor.

I am not angry at bile and the rest, even though they are great causes of suffering. Why then be angry at sentient beings? They too are provoked by conditions.

Just as this pain arises unwished for, so too anger arises forcefully, though unwished for.

A person does not become angry thinking "I shall become angry." And anger does not arise intending "I shall arise."

Whatever offenses there are, and whatever various evils—all arise through the force of conditions. There is nothing that is independent.

The collection of conditions does not have the thought "I shall produce." Nor does what is produced have the thought "I was produced."

That which is called the "primal" and is desired as the self—even that does not arise thinking "I shall come into being."

For what is not arisen does not exist. Who then would wish to come into being? And since it is occupied with objects, it does not even exert itself to cease.

If the self is permanent and non-conscious, like space, it is clearly without action. Even in connection with other conditions, what action is there for what is unchanging?

If at the time of action it is the same as before, what is done by it through action? If there is a connection of action to it, which one is the basis of that?

Thus everything is dependent on another, and that upon which it depends is itself not independent. When beings are like magical creations without volition, at whom should one be angry?

If one objects: "Even so, warding off anger is not appropriate. For who wards off what?"—it is appropriate, since there is dependent origination and cessation of suffering is accepted.

Therefore, seeing either enemy or friend acting wrongly, reflecting "Such are his conditions," one should be happy.

## Day 11: Suffering (Chapter 6, Verses 34-66)

If all embodied beings achieved their goals just by wishing, no one would have any suffering, for no one wishes to suffer.

Through carelessness, people injure themselves with thorns and the like, through anger with fasting, and through desire for unattainable women.

Some kill themselves by hanging, by throwing themselves off cliffs, by eating poison and unwholesome things, and by non-meritorious conduct.

If, when overcome by afflictions, they kill even the beloved self, how could there be restraint toward the bodies of others?

Toward those maddened by afflictions, engaged in killing themselves—not only is there no compassion, but anger arises. How?

If it is the nature of fools to cause harm to others, anger toward them is not appropriate—just as toward fire, whose nature is to burn.

And if this fault is adventitious and beings are by nature gentle, anger toward them is equally inappropriate—like anger at the sky for acrid smoke.

If, ignoring the main cause such as the stick, one is angry at the inciter, that one too is incited by hatred. Better that I be angry at hatred.

In the past I too have caused such harm to sentient beings. Therefore it is right for me—who harm beings—to receive this.

Both his weapon and my body are causes of suffering. He took up the weapon; I took up the body. At which should I be angry?

This body-boil, shaped like a person, taken by me, unable to bear touch—blinded by craving, at which should I be angry when it suffers?

I do not wish for suffering, yet foolishly I wish for its cause. When suffering comes through my own fault, why be angry at another?

Just as the sword-leaf forest, and just as the hell-birds—these are produced by my own karma. At what should I be angry?

Impelled by my karma alone, those who harm me have arisen. By that they will go to hells. Have they not been slain by me?

Relying on these, much of my sin is destroyed through patience. But relying on me, these go to hells of long suffering.

I am the one who has harmed these beings, and these are my benefactors. Having reversed this, why do you, O wicked mind, become angry?

If there is merit in my intention, I shall not go to hells. If the self is protected by me, what comes to these from that?

And if I were to retaliate, even so, these would not be protected. My conduct would be impaired, and thus these ascetics would be ruined.

Since the mind is formless, it cannot be harmed by anyone anywhere. But through attachment to the body, it is afflicted by bodily suffering.

Contempt, harsh speech, disgrace—this group does not harm the body. Why then, mind, do you become angry?

Will others' displeasure toward me devour me, either in this life or in another, that it is unwanted by me?

If it is unwanted because it causes obstruction to gain—my gain will perish here; my sin will remain firmly.

Better that death come to me today than a long life through wrong livelihood. For even after living long, there is still the suffering of death for me.

One person, having enjoyed happiness for a hundred years in a dream, wakes up. Another, having been happy for a moment, wakes up.

Surely happiness ceases for both who have awakened. It is just so at the time of death for one who lived long and one who lived briefly.

Even after obtaining many gains and enjoying pleasures for a long time, I shall go empty-handed and naked, like one who was robbed.

If through gain I live and destroy sin and do merit—is it not the case that one who is angry for the sake of gain destroys merit and does sin?

If the very purpose for which I live perishes—what is the use of a life that only does evil?

If one objects: "Hatred toward the one who speaks ill destroys beings"—why does your anger not arise also toward one who speaks ill of another?

Your patience toward those who are displeased with another is explained by their dependence on conditions—but there is no patience toward one who speaks ill of you, who is dependent on the arising of afflictions.

Toward those who destroy or slander images, stūpas, or the true Dharma, it is not appropriate for me to be angry, for the Buddhas and the rest are not harmed.

Toward those who harm teachers, relatives, and dear ones, seeing that this arises from conditions as before, one should ward off anger.

Harm to embodied beings is certainly made by both conscious and non-conscious causes. That harm is seen in the conscious one. Therefore be patient with this harm.

## Day 12: Compassion (Chapter 6, Verses 67-100)

Some offend through delusion; others, also deluded, become angry. Which of these do we call blameless? Which do we call blameworthy?

Why did I act thus before, that I am now harmed by others in this way? All are dependent on karma. Who am I to alter this?

Having understood this, I thus make effort toward merit, so that all will become friendly-minded toward each other.

When a house is burning, and fire has gone from it to another house, one should remove and throw away the straw and such where it might spread.

So too, when the mind is burned by the fire of hatred through attachment, at that moment one should abandon it, fearing the burning up of the body of merit.

If one who is to be killed is cut free and released, what misfortune is that? If one is freed from human suffering and hells, what misfortune?

If even this mere suffering today cannot be endured, why is anger—the cause of hell-suffering—not warded off?

For the sake of anger, I have been tortured in hells thousands of times, having achieved neither my own purpose nor the purpose of others.

But this is not such suffering, and it will accomplish a great purpose. Here, suffering that removes the suffering of the world should bring only joy.

If others have obtained pleasure and happiness through praising one rich in virtues, mind, you too, praising him—why do you not rejoice thus?

This joy-happiness of yours is blameless, a source of happiness, not prohibited by the virtuous—the best way of winning over others.

If you object: "This is his happiness alone"—then if this is not pleasing to you, both visible and invisible results are destroyed by ceasing to pay wages and such.

When your own virtue is being proclaimed, you want others' happiness too. When another's virtue is being proclaimed, you do not want even your own happiness.

Having generated bodhicitta out of desire for the happiness of all beings, why do you now become angry at beings who have obtained happiness by themselves?

Do you not wish buddhahood—which is worshipped by the three worlds—for beings? Why are you burned seeing their transitory honor?

One who nourishes him whom you should nourish—he gives to you yourself. Having found one who supports his family, you do not rejoice but become angry.

For one who wishes awakening for beings, does he not wish this? Where is the bodhicitta of one who is angry at another's prosperity?

If it was not received by him, it remains in the benefactor's house. In any case it is not yours. What does it matter to you whether it is given or not given?

Should he obstruct his merit, his admirers, his own virtues? Should he, when receiving, not accept? Tell me, at whom are you not angry?

Not only do you not grieve for yourself who have done evil, but you want to compete with those who have done merit.

If something unpleasant has arisen for your enemy, what will come of your satisfaction? Your mere wish will not become a cause without that.

And if it were accomplished by your wish—what happiness is there in his suffering for you? Even if there were purpose, what misfortune could be greater than this?

For this is the terrible hook cast by the fishermen of afflictions—from which, having purchased you, the hell-guardians will cook you in pots.

Praise, fame, and honor are not for merit, not for longevity, not for strength, not for health, not for bodily comfort to me.

This much would be one's own purpose for a wise person who knows his own purpose. Should gambling and drinking be resorted to by one who wishes mental happiness?

For the sake of fame, some give away wealth and even kill themselves. What can syllables be eaten? And when one is dead, whose is that happiness?

Just as a child cries distressfully when his sand castle is broken, so does my mind appear to me when praise and fame are lost.

A word, lacking consciousness—it is impossible that it praises me. "Another is pleased in me"—if this is the cause of my joy—

—what is the use to me of another's joy, whether in me or in another? The pleasure-happiness is his alone. Not even a small portion of it is mine.

If my happiness is through his happiness, this should be so always everywhere. Why is there no happiness for me when others are happy through the favor of another?

Therefore, the joy that arises in me thinking "I am praised"—even that, being unconnected, is merely childish behavior.

Praise and the rest disturb my equanimity, destroy my disenchantment, create jealousy toward the virtuous, and anger at success.

Therefore, those who are present for the destruction of my praise and the rest—are they not engaged in protecting me from falling to lower realms?

It is inappropriate for me, who seeks liberation, to be bound by gain and honor. Those who free me from bondage—how can I be angry at them?


---

## Day 13: Benefit (Chapter 6, Verses 101-134)

For one who wishes to enter suffering, those who have become like a door—as if by the Buddha's blessing—how can I be angry at them?

If one objects: "He has created an obstacle to merit"—anger is not appropriate here. There is no austerity equal to patience—surely this has arrived.

And if through my own fault I do not practice patience here, then the obstacle to merit has been created by me alone, when the cause was present.

That without which something does not exist and on the existence of which it exists—that is indeed its cause. How is it called an obstacle?

An obstacle to generosity is not made by a suppliant who appeared at the proper time. And when one seeking ordination arrives, it is not called an obstacle to ordination.

Those who beg are easily found in the world, but those who harm are difficult to find. For if I have not offended, no one will offend me.

Therefore, the enemy, having arisen in my house like a treasure acquired without effort, should be cherished by me as a helper in the bodhisattva conduct.

The fruit of patience is obtained by me and by him. Therefore, to him first should it be given, for patience came first from him.

If one objects: "He has no intention of accomplishing patience, therefore the enemy is not to be honored"—then why is the true Dharma honored, though it is a suitable cause of accomplishment?

If one objects: "The enemy is not to be honored because his intention is to harm"—how else would I have patience, as toward a physician intent on benefit?

It is precisely in dependence on his hostile intention that patience arises. Therefore he is the cause of patience and should be honored by me like the true Dharma.

Therefore the Sage said that the field of beings and the field of the Victors are alike. For many have gone to the far shore of attainment by pleasing them.

When the acquisition of Buddha-qualities from beings and from Victors is equal, what logic is there in not treating beings with the same respect as Victors?

The greatness of intention is not from itself but from its effect. Therefore the greatness of beings is equal, and thus they are equal.

The friendliness of intention is what is worthy of honor—that is the greatness of beings. And the merit from pleasing the Buddha—that is the greatness of the Buddha.

Therefore beings are equal to Victors in the portion of contributing to Buddha-qualities. But none are equal to Buddhas, who are oceans of virtue with infinite portions.

If even a particle of virtue were seen anywhere in those who are a unique collection of the essence of virtues, even the three worlds would not be sufficient for its worship.

But in beings there exists the best portion of giving rise to Buddha-qualities. In proportion to that portion, worship of beings should be made.

Moreover, for genuine kinsmen of immeasurable benefit, what other repayment could there be than pleasing beings?

For their sake bodies are torn apart and one enters Avīci—when that is done for them, that is done. Therefore one should do only good toward these, even though they are great offenders.

My lords themselves, for their own sake, are unconcerned even for their own selves. How can I act with pride toward these lords and not with servitude?

From the happiness of beings comes the joy of the Lords of Sages; at their suffering they enter into anger. From pleasing them comes the delight of all the Lords of Sages; harm to them is harm to the Sages.

Just as there is no mental happiness for one whose body is completely on fire, even with all pleasures—so too, for those who are made of compassion, there is no means of joy when beings suffer.

Therefore, whatever suffering I have caused to all the greatly compassionate ones by harming beings—today I confess that sin. May the Sages forgive that which has distressed them.

In order to please the Tathāgatas, today I enter into servitude to the world with my entire self. Let the multitudes of beings place their feet on my head or strike me. May the Lord of the World be pleased.

That the compassionate ones have made this entire world their own—of this there is no doubt. Those who are seen in the form of beings—they themselves are the Protectors. Why this disrespect here?

This is the way to please the Tathāgatas. This is the way to accomplish one's own welfare. This is the way to remove the suffering of the world. Therefore let this be my vow.

Just as a single king's officer overpowers a great people, the great people are unable to resist—for they are far-seeing.

For he is not alone; his power is the king's power. So too, one should not despise any offender who is weak.

For the hell-guardians and the compassionate ones are his power. Therefore one should please beings, as a servant pleases a fierce king.

What could an angered king do that would equal the hell-suffering experienced through making beings unhappy?

What could a pleased king give that would equal buddhahood, experienced through making beings happy?

Setting aside the future buddhahood that arises from pleasing beings—do you not see even here the good fortune, fame, and well-being?

A charming appearance, health, joy, long life, the vast happiness of a cakravartin—the patient one attains all these while wandering in saṃsāra.


---

## Day 14: Laziness (Chapter 7, Verses 1-38)

Thus, having patient forbearance, one should cultivate heroic effort, for awakening is established in effort. Without effort there is no merit—just as without wind there is no movement.

What is heroic effort? Enthusiasm for the wholesome. Its adversary is called: laziness, attachment to the contemptible, discouragement, and self-deprecation.

Through relishing the pleasure of inactivity, through craving for sleep and reliance on it, through lack of distress at the sufferings of saṃsāra—laziness arises.

Caught by the afflictions' huntsmen, you have entered the hunter's net of births. Do you still not know today that you have entered the mouth of death?

Do you not see that those of your own kind are being slaughtered one by one? Yet you go to sleep like a buffalo before the butcher.

When Yama is watching you, when your path is blocked on all sides—how can eating please you? How can sleep? How can pleasure?

When death comes quickly, while your provisions are still being gathered, even if you abandon laziness then—what will you do when it is too late?

"This I have not obtained, this I have begun, this remains half-done—and suddenly death has arrived! Alas, I am slain!"—thinking thus...

...seeing your relatives in despair, faces tear-stained and red-eyed with the swell of grief, seeing the faces of Yama's messengers...

...tormented by memories of your own sins, hearing the sounds of the hells, your body smeared with filth from terror—what will you do in your confusion?

"I am like a live fish"—if such fear is appropriate even now, how much more so for one who has done evil, facing the intense sufferings of the hells?

O delicate one, you burn when touched even by hot water. Having done deeds that lead to hell, how do you sit so calmly?

You who want results without effort, delicate one, much-afflicted one, seized by death yet acting as if immortal—O suffering one, you are being destroyed!

Having obtained this human vessel, cross the great river of suffering. O fool, this is not the time for sleep—this boat is difficult to find again!

Abandoning the supreme joy of the Dharma—an unending stream of happiness—how can you take pleasure in frivolity and laughter, which are causes of suffering?

Non-discouragement, the army of strength, application, self-mastery, equalizing self and other, and exchanging self and other.

One should not be discouraged thinking "How could awakening be for me?" For the Tathāgata, the truth-speaker, spoke this truth:

"Even gnats, flies, mosquitoes, and worms have attained that supreme awakening so difficult to reach, through the power of their enthusiasm."

How much more so I, born human, able to discern benefit from harm? Not abandoning the way of the Omniscient Ones, why should I not attain awakening?

If I have fear thinking "Hands and feet and such must be given"—that would be my confusion about what is heavy and what is light, from lack of investigation.

For innumerable aeons, countless beyond reckoning, I have been cut, torn, burned, and split—yet awakening did not arise.

But this limited suffering of mine accomplishes complete awakening—like the pain of removing a splinter, for the relief it brings.

All physicians produce health through painful procedures. Therefore, to destroy many sufferings, a little must be endured.

But the Supreme Physician has not even given this conventional treatment. He heals the gravely ill through the gentlest of methods.

At first, the Guide prescribes the giving of vegetables and such. Later, gradually, one comes to give even one's own flesh.

When insight arises toward one's own flesh as toward vegetables, then what is difficult about giving up flesh and bone?

One is not unhappy from having abandoned sin; one is not sad from being wise. For suffering comes to the mind from false conception, and to the body from sin.

The body is happy through merit; the mind is happy through wisdom. Dwelling in saṃsāra for the sake of others, why should the compassionate one be afflicted?

Destroying former sins, receiving oceans of merit—through the power of bodhicitta alone, one is swifter than the Śrāvakas.

Thus going from happiness to happiness—who with sense would be discouraged? Having obtained the chariot of bodhicitta, which removes all weariness and toil?

The powers of aspiration, steadfastness, delight, and releasing are for accomplishing the welfare of beings. One should generate aspiration through fear of suffering and by contemplating benefits.

Thus, having uprooted the adversary, one should strive for increase of enthusiasm through the powers of aspiration, pride, delight, releasing, application, and self-mastery.

I must destroy immeasurable faults, my own and others'. But the destruction of each single fault would take oceans of aeons.

If I do not see even the slightest beginning of destroying faults, and I am the vessel for immeasurable suffering—why does my heart not burst?

I must develop many qualities, my own and others'. But the practice of each single quality might not occur even in oceans of aeons.

I have never developed even a fraction of these qualities. Wondrous though it is to have obtained this birth, I have wasted it in vain.

I have not attained the happiness of the great festival of worship of the Blessed One. I have not served the Teaching. I have not fulfilled the hopes of the poor.

I have not given fearlessness to the fearful. I have not made the afflicted happy. I have become only a spike in my mother's womb, destined for suffering.


---

## Day 15: Power (Chapter 7, Verses 39-76)

From the loss of my wish for the Dharma in former lives, now this disaster has arisen for me. Who would relinquish the wish for the Dharma?

The Sage declared that aspiration is the root of all wholesome things. And its root is the constant contemplation of the ripening of results.

Suffering, mental distress, and various fears, and the obstruction of desires—these arise for those who do evil.

Wherever the wish of those who do good goes, there, by those very merits, they are honored with the reward of their results.

But wherever the wish of the evildoer goes, there, by those very sins, they are struck down with the weapons of suffering.

Through virtue, as children of the Sugata, they come before the Sugata—dwelling in the wombs of vast, cool lotuses fragrant and sweet, their radiance increased by nourishment from the Victor's sweet voice, their beautiful bodies emerging from lotuses opened by the sage's rays.

Through evil, crying out in pain as Yama's minions strip all skin, their bodies doused with molten copper heated by fire, their flesh cut into hundreds of pieces by the blows of blazing swords and lances—one falls repeatedly onto the ground of burning iron.

Therefore aspiration for the wholesome should be generated, contemplating this with care. Beginning with the method of Vajradhvaja, one should cultivate pride.

First examining one's capacity, one should undertake or not undertake. Not undertaking is better than undertaking only to turn back.

In another life too, this habit continues; sin and suffering increase. And another task and its time are lost—and even that task is not accomplished.

Self-confidence should be applied to three things: action, defilements, and capacity. "I alone must do this"—this is the self-confidence regarding action.

This world, under the power of afflictions, is unable to accomplish its own welfare. Therefore I must do it for them, for I am not incapable like ordinary people.

When another is doing lowly work, should I just stand by? If I do not do it out of pride, better that my pride perish.

Even a crow acts like a Garuḍa when it finds a dead snake. If my mind is weak, even a small onslaught will harm me.

When one stops trying, given to discouragement, misfortunes easily prevail. But one who rises up and strives is hard to conquer even by the great.

Therefore, with a firm mind, I shall overcome misfortune through misfortune. For one who wishes to conquer the three worlds, defeat by me is laughable.

I must conquer all; I shall be conquered by none. I shall bear this pride, for I am the offspring of the Lion of Victors.

Those beings conquered by pride are wretched—they are not proud. The proud one does not come under the power of the enemy; but those are under the power of the enemy pride.

Led by pride to the lower realms, even as humans they have lost all joy—eating others' leavings, as slaves, foolish, ugly, and emaciated.

Everywhere despised, those ascetics stiff with pride—if they too are counted among the proud, then tell me, what is pitiable?

Those are the proud and victorious, those are the heroes, who bear pride for the sake of conquering the enemy pride—who, having slain that quivering enemy pride, freely grant the fruit of victory to beings.

Stationed amid the host of afflictions, one should be defiant a thousandfold—unconquerable by the hosts of afflictions, like a lion among herds of deer.

Even in great difficulties, the eye does not see taste. So too, even when meeting difficulty, one should not come under the power of afflictions.

One should be addicted to whatever task one is undertaking, intoxicated by that task, insatiable—like one who wants the fruit-pleasure of play.

Work is done for the sake of happiness, yet whether happiness comes or not is uncertain. But for one whose happiness is in the work itself—how can one be happy without work?

In saṃsāra there is no satisfaction in sensual pleasures, which are like honey on a razor's edge. How could there be satisfaction in the nectar of merit, whose ripening is sweet and blissful?

Therefore, even at the end of a task, one should plunge into another task, just as an elephant scorched by the midday sun, upon finding a lake, plunges in.

But when strength declines, one should release to continue later. When well completed, one should release with thirst for what comes next.

One should guard against the blows of the afflictions and strike firmly at the afflictions—like one engaged in sword-battle with a trained enemy.

Just as one would quickly and fearfully seize a dropped sword, so should one seize the dropped sword of mindfulness, remembering the hells.

Just as poison reaching the blood spreads through the body, so when a fault finds an opening, it spreads through the mind.

Like an oil-bearer watched by sword-bearers, who in fear of death if he stumbles is completely focused on the oil—so too should the practitioner be focused.

Therefore, just as one quickly rises when a snake comes into one's lap, so when the approach of sleep and laziness comes, one should quickly counter them.

At each misstep, one should be thoroughly remorseful and reflect: "How shall I act so that this does not happen to me again?"

One should seek association or activity for this reason, thinking: "How may the practice of mindfulness come about in these circumstances?"

One should make oneself light, remembering the instruction on heedfulness, so that before the approach of action, one is ready for everything.

Just as cotton goes wherever the wind takes it, coming or going—so one should go where enthusiasm takes one, and thus success is achieved.


---

## Day 16: Stillness (Chapter 8, Verses 1-31)

Having thus increased effort, one should establish the mind in meditation. For a person with a distracted mind dwells between the fangs of afflictions.

Through the seclusion of body and mind, distraction does not arise. Therefore, abandoning the world, one should abandon discursive thoughts.

Through attachment the world is not abandoned, and through craving for gain and such. Therefore, to abandon these, the wise one should reflect thus:

Knowing that through tranquility well-endowed with insight the afflictions are destroyed, tranquility should be sought first. And that arises through being free from concern about the world, through delight in detachment.

Who among impermanent beings should have affection for impermanent things? For thousands of births one will not see the beloved again.

Without seeing, one does not attain joy, and does not remain in concentration. Even seeing, one is not satisfied—as before, one is afflicted by craving.

One does not see things as they are; one falls from disenchantment. One is burned by that grief, by the desire to meet the beloved.

By thinking of that, one's short life goes by in vain, again and again. By a transient friend, the eternal Dharma is ruined.

Behaving in common with fools, one surely goes to lower rebirths. And being led to what is unwholesome—what is gained from the company of fools?

In an instant they become friends; in an instant they become enemies. They become angry at what ought to please. Ordinary people are difficult to satisfy.

When told something beneficial, they become angry and prevent me from the beneficial. If they are not listened to, they become angry and go to lower rebirths.

Jealous of the superior, competitive with equals, arrogant toward the inferior, puffed up by praise, angry at criticism—when is there benefit from the fool?

From fool to fool there inevitably arises some unwholesomeness: self-praise, disparagement of others, conversation about the pleasures of saṃsāra.

Thus from that association with that one comes a meeting with misfortune. I shall dwell alone, happy, with an unafflicted mind.

One should flee far from the fool; having met them, one should please them with kind words—not through the intimacy of familiarity, but being indifferent, like a virtuous person.

Taking only dharma-essence, like a bee taking honey from flowers, I shall dwell everywhere unknown, as if new.

"I am a gainer, I am honored, many want me"—such pride of the mortal leads to fear at the approach of death.

Wherever the mind deluded by pleasure goes, there that pleasure-multiplied-a-thousandfold-into-suffering stands before it.

Therefore the wise one should not desire that. From desire fear arises. This passes by itself—having made firmness, one should wait.

Many gained wealth, many gained fame—but where did they go, together with their wealth and fame? No one knows.

Others despise me—why should I rejoice when praised? Others praise me—why should I be sad when criticized?

Beings of various inclinations are not satisfied even by the Jinas. How much less by an ignorant person like me! So why think about worldly people?

They revile one without gain; they disparage one with gain. When those are painful to associate with by nature, how can delight arise from them?

"The fool is no one's friend"—so the Tathāgatas have said. For the fool's affection arises only from self-interest.

What affection arises through self-interest is affection for self-interest. Just as there is agitation when property is lost—that is from the loss of happiness it brought.

Trees do not blame, and they need not be pleased with effort. When might I dwell together with those happy companions?

Dwelling in an empty temple, at the foot of a tree, or in caves—when shall I go without looking back, without concern?

Dwelling in places naturally vast and unclaimed, freely wandering—when shall I dwell unattached?

With just an earthen bowl for wealth, with robes unattractive to thieves—when shall I dwell fearless, not guarding the body?

Going to my own charnel ground, when shall I compare my own body with other skeletons—subject to decay as it is?

For this body of mine will become so putrid that even jackals will not approach it because of the smell.


---

## Day 17: Attachment (Chapter 8, Verses 32-62)

The bone-pieces arising together with this single body will become separate. How much more so other beloved people.

Alone one is born; alone one dies. This share of suffering cannot be taken by another. What use are obstructing loved ones?

Just as one on a journey takes up a dwelling-place, so one journeying through existence takes up the dwelling-place of a birth.

Until this body is carried out by four people, while the world still grieves—just so long should one go to the forest.

Without intimacy and hostility, this body is already dead to the world. When dying, one does not grieve.

And no one near causes distress by grieving. And no one disturbs the recollection of the Buddha and such.

Therefore solitude is delightful, free from distress, source of well-being, calming all distractions—always to be cultivated by me.

Released from all other thoughts, with a mind single-pointedly focused on my own mind, I shall strive for concentration and for taming the mind.

For sensual pleasures produce misfortune, in this world and the next: here through bondage, killing, and cutting; hereafter through hell and such.

[Verses 41–84 continue the extensive foulness contemplation (aśubha-bhāvanā), examining the impurity of the body and the delusion of attraction. Key themes include:]

-


---

## Day 18: The Body (Chapter 8, Verses 63-93)

Thus recoiling from sensual pleasures, one should generate delight in solitude, in peaceful forest lands empty of conflict and strife.

Happy ones walk on broad rock terraces of palaces pleasant with moonbeam-sandalwood coolness, fanned by the silent, gentle forest breeze—contemplating for the benefit of others.

Dwelling for as long as desired in empty places, at the foot of a tree, in caves—freed from the weariness of guarding possessions—one wanders as one wishes, without concern.

Dwelling where one wishes, free, attached to no one—one enjoys such happiness of contentment as even Indra would find difficult to obtain.

Thus, through such aspects, cultivating the virtues of solitude, with discursive thoughts calmed, one should cultivate bodhicitta.

First, one should thus carefully cultivate the equality of self and other: all are equal in suffering and happiness—they should be protected by me as if they were myself.

Just as the body, with its many parts such as hands, is to be protected as a single thing—so too this world, though differentiated, is the same in suffering and happiness.

Even though my suffering does not affect other bodies, it is still suffering that is unbearable to me because of attachment to self.

So too, even though another's suffering is not experienced by me in myself, it is still suffering unbearable to him because of attachment to self.


---

## Day 19: Equality (Chapter 8, Verses 94-124)

Another's suffering is to be removed by me, for it is suffering, like my own suffering. Others are to be benefited by me, for they are sentient beings, like my own being.

When happiness is equally dear to me and to others, what is special about me that I strive for happiness for myself alone?

When fear and suffering are equally unwanted by me and by others, what is special about me that I protect myself and not others?

If I do not protect them because their suffering does not harm me—the suffering of the future body does not harm me either. Why then is that protected?

"I shall be that very one then"—this conception is false. For it is one who dies and entirely another who is born.

If whatever suffering someone has is to be protected by that very one, foot-suffering is not the hand's—why then is that protected by it?

If this is inappropriate but proceeds from grasping an "I"—what is inappropriate for oneself and for another is to be abandoned as far as possible.

A continuum and a group are false, like a row and an army. There is no one whose suffering it is. Therefore, whose is it to be called "one's own"?

All sufferings equally are without owner. They are to be warded off simply because they are suffering. What use is a restriction here?

Why should suffering be warded off? Because it is agreed by all without dispute. If it is to be warded off, then all of it equally. If not, then for me as for another.

One who wishes to quickly rescue self and other should practice that supreme secret: the exchange of self and other.

Because of excessive love for the self, there is fear even from a small danger. Who would not hate that self like an enemy, which causes fear?

One who, thinking to cure illness such as hunger and thirst, kills birds, fish, and deer, and lies in wait on the road—

—one who for the sake of gain and honor would kill even parents, would steal the Three Jewels' property, and would become fuel for Avīci—

—what wise person would desire, protect, or honor that self? Who would not see it as an enemy? Who would respect it?

[Verses 125–154 continue the exchange practice, including:]

-


---

## Day 20: Exchange (Chapter 8, Verses 125-155)

Countless aeons have passed while you sought your own welfare. By that great effort you have gained only suffering.


---

## Day 21: Mastery (Chapter 8, Verses 156-186)

By my instruction, engage thus without hesitation. Later you will see its benefits, for the Sage's word is true.

[Verses 157–172 address the self directly, commanding it to serve others]

If you have affection for the self, do not take pleasure in the self. If the self is to be protected, this one should not be protected.

The more this body is protected, the more delicate it becomes, and just so the more it falls.

When it has thus fallen, even the whole earth is unable to fulfill its wishes. Then who will fulfill its wish?

For one who wishes what cannot be had, affliction and disappointed hope arise. For one who is without hope in all things, prosperity never decays.

Therefore, no scope should be given for the body's wish-increase. That is the good thing: what is not grasped as desirable is not taken.

This ending in ashes, inert, moved by another—this horrible impure image—why do I grasp it?

What use to me is this machine, living or dead? How is it different from a clod of dirt? Alas, why does my "I"-grasping not perish?

Therefore I have given up this body for the welfare of the world. Though it has many faults, it is maintained as an instrument of action.

So, enough of worldly conduct! Following the wise, remembering the instruction on heedfulness, I shall ward off drowsiness and dullness.

Therefore, to destroy the obscurations, I shall practice concentration, drawing the mind back from wrong paths, constantly on its own support.


---

## Day 22: Two Truths (Chapter 9, Verses 1-33)

All this preparation the Sage declared for the sake of wisdom. Therefore, one who wishes to end suffering should generate wisdom.

Two truths are held to exist: conventional and ultimate. Reality is beyond the scope of intellect. Intellect is called conventional.

With respect to this, the world is seen as twofold: the yogin and the ordinary. With respect to this, the ordinary world is refuted by the world of yogins.

And yogins are refuted by successively higher ones, through distinctions of intelligence—for the purpose of an outcome accepted by both, without analysis.

By the world, things are seen and conceived as real—not as illusion-like. Here there is disagreement between yogins and the world.

Even direct perception of form and such is by convention, not by valid cognition—that convention is false, like the convention of purity regarding impure things.

And for the purpose of leading the world, things are taught by the Protector. In reality they are momentary—if this contradicts convention, so be it.

There is no fault for the yogin by way of convention. For truth-seers see differently from the world. Otherwise there would be worldly refutation of the perception of women as impure.


---

## Day 23: Emptiness (Chapter 9, Verses 34-66)

If there is fear from that thing which produces suffering, let there be fear! Emptiness is the calmer of suffering—from that why should fear arise?

If there is any self, let there be fear from that! But I am not anything at all. If "I" am nothing, fear of whom will there be?

I am not teeth, hair, or nails. I am not bones, nor am I blood. I am not mucus, nor phlegm, nor pus, nor lymph.

I am not fat, nor sweat, nor marrow, nor entrails. I am not the visceral cavity. I am not feces and urine.

I am not flesh, nor sinews. I am not warmth nor wind. I am not the orifices, nor am I the six consciousnesses in any way.

[Verses 62–75 continue the analysis of consciousness, refuting Sāṃkhya and other views]


---

## Day 24: Selflessness (Chapter 9, Verses 67-100)

"If there is no being, toward whom is compassion?" Toward that which is projected for the purpose of outcomes, through the delusion assumed.

"Whose is the outcome if there is no being?" True, the effort is from delusion. But for the cessation of suffering, the delusion of the outcome is not prevented.

But the delusion of the self, the cause of suffering, increases from the delusion of an "I." If that too is not to be stopped, better is the meditation on selflessness.

The body is not the feet, nor the calves. The body is not the thighs, nor the hip. The body is not the belly, nor is it the back. The body is not the chest, nor the arms.

It is not the hands, nor the sides, nor the armpits, nor characterized by the shoulders. It is not the neck, nor the head. Then what is the body here?

Therefore there is no body. But from delusion there is the idea of a body in the hands and such, due to a particular arrangement—like the idea of a person in a post.

Thus, when form is like a dream, who is attached upon investigation? And when the body does not exist thus, then who is a woman and who is a man?

If suffering truly exists, why does it not afflict the happy? If delicacies are truly pleasant suffering, why are they not enjoyed by the grief-stricken?

When there is no experiencer at all and feeling also does not exist, then, having seen this situation, O craving, why are you not destroyed?


---

## Day 25: Critique (Chapter 9, Verses 101-133)

There is no experiencer at all. Therefore feeling does not exist in reality. In this selfless aggregate, who exactly is afflicted by it?

The mind is not located in the sense organs, not in form and such, not in between. And the mind is not found within or without, nor is it found elsewhere.

That which is not in the body nor elsewhere, not mixed nor separate anywhere—that is nothing at all. Therefore beings are by nature beyond sorrow.

"Īśvara is the cause of the world." Tell me, what really is Īśvara? If you say "the elements"—let it be so! But why the trouble over a mere name?

Moreover, the elements are many, impermanent, without consciousness, not divine, to be stepped over, impure—earth and so on are not Īśvara.

Space is not the lord, as it is inactive. Not the self, because that was refuted before. And if the creatorship of the unthinkable is also unthinkable, what is there to say about it?


---

## Day 26: Presence (Chapter 9, Verses 134-167)

What is made by illusion and what is made by causes—investigate where it comes from and where it goes.

What is seen in the presence of something else and not in its absence—like a reflection, how can it be real when it is artificial?

Thus there is no cessation and no arising. Therefore all this world is unborn and unceased.

The movements of saṃsāra are like a dream. Upon investigation, they are like a plantain tree. In reality there is no distinction between those passed beyond sorrow and those not.

With all phenomena thus empty, what is gained and what is lost? By whom will respect or contempt be received?

Whence is happiness or suffering? What is liked or disliked? That craving—when sought in its nature, what is that craving?

Upon investigation, what world of the living exists? Who will die here? What will become? What was? Who is a relative? Who is a friend?

May those like me understand: all is like space! They become angry, they rejoice, through causes of conflict and celebration.

Moreover, moments are difficult to find, the arising of a Buddha is extremely rare, and the flood of afflictions is hard to restrain. Alas, the succession of sufferings!

Alas, those extremely pitiable ones, dwelling in the flood of suffering, who do not see their own distress, even though so extremely distressed!

When shall I bring peace to those tormented by the fire of suffering, through my own resources of happiness arising from clouds of merit?


---

## Day 27: Giving Back (Chapter 10, Verses 1-58)

Through the virtue of my contemplating the Bodhicaryāvatāra, may all beings become adorned with the bodhisattva conduct.

May all beings in all directions who are afflicted with suffering of body and mind obtain, through my merit, oceans of joy and happiness.

As long as they remain in saṃsāra, may their happiness never decrease. May the world attain the uninterrupted happiness of the bodhisattvas.

In all the world-systems, may beings in the hells delight in the joys and delights of Sukhāvatī.

May those suffering from cold obtain warmth. May those suffering from heat become cool, through oceans of water arising from the great clouds of the bodhisattvas.

May the sword-leaf forest become a Nandana grove for them. May the Kūṭaśālmalī trees become wish-fulfilling trees.

May the hell-realms become delightful, with ponds beautified by the sounds of cranes, ruddy geese, cakravāka birds, and swans, fragrant with the scent of abundant lotuses.

May the heap of burning coals become a heap of jewels. May the burning ground become crystal flooring. May the crushing mountains become palaces of worship filled with Sugatas.

May the rain of burning coals, lava, and weapons become from now on a rain of flowers. May the mutual fighting with weapons become, from now on, playful fighting with flowers.

May those sunk in the Vaitaraṇī River, bodies of white bone with all flesh fallen, skins cooked as in blazing fire—may they, by the power of my virtue, obtain divine bodies and dwell with divine maidens in the Mandākinī River.

"The servants of Yama, the crows, and the vultures are suddenly terrified—whence is this gentle radiance filling the sky with bliss, the darkness destroyed on all sides?" Looking upward, seeing the blazing Vajrapāṇi in the sky, may they, through the force of joy, with faults departed, go with him.

May a rain of lotuses fall, mixed with fragrant water, visibly extinguishing the fire of hell. "What is this? Happiness has refreshed me!" May the sight of Kamala-pāṇi ("Lotus-Hand") come to those in hell.

"Come, come quickly! Cast away fear, brothers! We are alive! A certain radiant, crested youth has arrived among us, giving fearlessness—by whose power all calamities have departed, streams of delight flow, bodhicitta is born, and compassion, the mother who rescues all people."

"Look! This one whose lotus-feet are worshipped with the crowns of hundreds of gods, whose eyes are moist with compassion, on whose head falls a rain of many flowers, whose charming kūṭāgāra-palaces are filled with thousands of goddesses singing praises—seeing Mañjughoṣa before them, may there be jubilation now among those in hell!"

May the fear of eating one another depart from the animals. May the hungry ghosts become happy, like the humans of Uttarakuru.

May the hungry ghosts be filled, may they be bathed and cooled forever, by the streams of milk flowing from the hand of noble Avalokiteśvara.

May the blind see forms. May the deaf always hear. May pregnant women give birth without pain, as did Māyādevī.

May they obtain whatever they wish: clothing, food, drink, garlands, sandalwood, and ornaments. May they obtain whatever gives delight to the mind.

May the fearful become fearless. May those struck with grief find joy. May the despondent become confident and free from anxiety.

May the sick have good health. May all beings be freed from bondage. May the weak become strong. May all have minds of loving-kindness toward one another.

May travelers on roads be happy. May all whose purpose is travel achieve their purpose without effort. And may those traveling by ship reach their destinations as they wish.

May those lost in wilderness find caravans. May they travel without fatigue and without fear of thieves and tigers.

May gods protect those asleep, those unconscious, those in danger—the sick, orphans, and aged, and those without protection.

May all beings be free from all states of misfortune. May they be endowed with faith, wisdom, and compassion. May they have good conduct and proper livelihood.

May they always recall their former lives. May they become weary of all existences. May they go forth from home and be nourished by the Sage.

May Buddhist monks accomplish their purpose. May they obtain all requisites. May they observe the discipline purely.

May monks disenchanted with their ways find joy. May they study and teach without distraction. May meditators find suitable places for retreat.

May all beings of the lower realms be reborn among humans. And may those humans meet with the teaching of the Buddha.

May all beings worship all the Buddhas. May they become possessed of boundless happiness.

May the intention of all bodhisattvas for beings' welfare be fulfilled. May beings obtain whatever the Protectors intend.

Likewise may the Pratyekabuddhas and Śrāvakas be happy.

And may I, through the grace of Mañjughoṣa, always attain remembrance of former lives, and ordination until the perfection of the stages.

May I live sustained by whatever little food suffices. May I obtain a suitable place for retreat in all my lives.

And whenever I wish to see or to question, may I see the Protector Mañjunātha himself, without obstruction.

May my conduct become like Mañjughoṣa's conduct, which fulfills the welfare of all beings in the ten directions.

As long as space endures, as long as beings endure, may I too remain, to dispel the suffering of the world.

Whatever suffering there is for the world, may all that ripen upon me. May the world be happy through the virtues of the bodhisattvas.

May the teaching that is the only medicine for the suffering of beings, the source of all prosperity, long remain, with honor and support.

I bow to Mañjughoṣa, by whose grace my mind turns toward virtue. I bow to my spiritual friend, by whose grace it increases.

Through the virtue arisen from composing this Bodhicaryāvatāra, may all beings enter the bodhisattva conduct.

May all throughout space who are afflicted by suffering of body and mind obtain, through my merit, oceans of joy.

As long as they remain in saṃsāra, may their happiness never decrease. May the world obtain the uninterrupted happiness of the bodhisattvas.

And may I, in all my lives, become the cause of joy for all beings—causing not even a moment's sorrow for any.

## Day 28: The Silence (Abhijit)

Rest in the echo of the dedication. No verses are recited today.
