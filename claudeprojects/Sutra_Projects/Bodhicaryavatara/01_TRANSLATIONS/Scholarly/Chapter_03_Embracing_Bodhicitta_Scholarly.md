## Bodhicittaparigrahaḥ — बोधिचित्तपरिग्रहः

*A Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel*

## I. Rejoicing in Virtue

### Verses 1–3: Anumodanā (Sympathetic Joy)

**Verse 1**
> I rejoice with joy in the virtue done by all beings—virtue that brings respite from the sufferings of the lower realms.¹ May those who suffer abide in happiness!

**Verse 2**
> I rejoice in the liberation of embodied beings from the suffering of saṃsāra. I rejoice in the bodhisattvahood and buddhahood of those Protectors.²

**Verse 3**
> I rejoice in the teachers' oceans of bodhicitta³ that bring happiness to all beings, and in their establishment of benefit for all sentient beings.

---

## II. Requesting and Supplicating

### Verses 4–5: Adhyeṣaṇā and Yācanā

**Verse 4**
> With palms joined, I entreat the fully awakened ones in all directions: may they kindle the lamp of Dharma⁴ for those who, through delusion, fall headlong into suffering.

**Verse 5**
> With palms joined, I beseech the Victors who wish to pass into nirvāṇa:⁵ may they remain for countless aeons, so that this world does not become blind.

---

## III. Dedication of Merit

### Verses 6–11: Pariṇāmanā (Turning Over Merit)

**Verse 6**
> Having done all this, may I, through whatever virtue I have accumulated, become one who completely pacifies all the suffering of all beings.⁶

**Verse 7**
> May I be medicine for the sick, and may I be their physician as well, and their nurse, until the disease does not recur.⁷

**Verse 8**
> May I quench the torment of hunger and thirst with showers of food and drink. In the intermediate aeons of famine,⁸ may I become food and drink.

**Verse 9**
> For destitute beings, may I become an inexhaustible treasury.⁹ May I attend upon them in various forms as requisites.

**Verse 10**
> This very self, my enjoyments, and all my virtue of the three times—all this I give away without attachment, for the accomplishment of the welfare of all beings.¹⁰

**Verse 11**
> The complete relinquishment of all is nirvāṇa, and my mind seeks nirvāṇa. If all must be given up by me, it is better that it be given to sentient beings.¹¹

## IV. Self-Offering to All Beings

### Verses 12–16: Radical Gift of Self

**Verse 12**
> I have rendered this self for the happiness of all embodied beings.¹² Let them always kill me, revile me, and shower me with dust.

**Verse 13**
> Let them play with my body, let them laugh at me and mock me. My body has been given to them—what use is this concern of mine for it?

**Verse 14**
> Let them make me perform whatever actions bring them happiness. May no harm ever come to anyone on my account.¹³

**Verse 15**
> If their attitude toward me, whether angry or pleased, becomes a cause for the constant fulfillment of all their aims—¹⁴

**Verse 16**
> —those who slander me, and others too who harm me, and likewise those who mock me—may they all share in awakening.¹⁵

---

## V. Becoming All Things for All Beings

### Verses 17–21: Universal Service

**Verse 17**
> May I be a protector for those without protection, a guide for travelers, a boat, a bridge, and a causeway for those who wish to cross.¹⁶

**Verse 18**
> May I be a lamp for those who need a lamp, a bed for those who need a bed. May I be a servant for all embodied beings who need a servant.

**Verse 19**
> May I become a wish-fulfilling gem,¹⁷ an excellent vase,¹⁸ a powerful mantra, a great medicine. May I become a wish-granting tree and a wish-fulfilling cow for beings.¹⁹

**Verse 20**
> Just as the elements such as earth and the rest are enjoyed in various ways by innumerable beings extending to the limits of space—

**Verse 21**
> —so may I be a source of sustenance, in various ways, for the realm of beings extending to the limits of space, until all have attained nirvāṇa.²⁰

## VI. Formal Generation of Bodhicitta

### Verses 22–23: The Vow Proper

**Verse 22**
> Just as the Sugatas of old embraced bodhicitta, just as they progressively trained in the bodhisattva trainings—²¹

**Verse 23**
> —so too do I generate bodhicitta for the welfare of the world, and likewise shall I train in those trainings in their proper sequence.²²

---

## VII. Celebration of the Vow

### Verses 24–31: Exultation

**Verse 24**
> Having thus wisely taken hold of bodhicitta with devotion, one should gladden the mind in order to strengthen what has been embraced:²³

**Verse 25**
> Today my birth has become fruitful! My human existence is well-obtained! Today I am born in the Buddha family! Now I am a child of the Buddhas!²⁴

**Verse 26**
> Henceforth I must perform the actions befitting those of my own family,²⁵ so that no stain will come upon this pure family.

**Verse 27**
> Like a blind person who finds a jewel in a heap of refuse²⁶—so, somehow, this bodhicitta has arisen in me.

**Verse 28**
> This elixir has arisen to destroy the death of the world.²⁷ This is the inexhaustible treasury that quells the poverty of the world.

**Verse 29**
> This is the supreme medicine that pacifies the disease of the world. This is the tree of rest for beings exhausted from wandering on the paths of existence.²⁸

**Verse 30**
> This is the public bridge for crossing out of the lower realms.²⁹ This is the moon of mind that has risen to pacify the afflictions of the world.

**Verse 31**
> This is the great sun that dispels the darkness of the world's ignorance. This is the fresh butter produced from churning the milk of the true Dharma.³⁰

# Scholarly Apparatus

## Footnotes

¹ **[Sanskrit]** *apāyaduḥkha*: Suffering of the *apāya*, the lower realms (hells, hungry ghosts, animals).

² **[Philosophical]** The sequence—bodhisattvahood and then buddhahood—indicates the path structure. Joy in others' spiritual attainments (*anumodanā*) is one of the seven-limb practice.

³ **[Sanskrit]** *cittotpādasamudra*: "Oceans of mind-generation"—the vast aspiration to awakening.

⁴ **[Sanskrit]** *dharmapradīpa*: The lamp of Dharma—teaching that illuminates the way out of suffering.

⁵ **[Cross-reference]** This is the *yācanā* (supplication) component of the seven-limb practice: requesting Buddhas not to pass into parinirvāṇa.

⁶ **[Sanskrit]** *sarvaduḥkhapraśāntikṛt*: One who brings about the complete pacification of all suffering.

⁷ **[Philosophical]** The threefold aspiration: to be medicine, physician, and nurse. This completeness characterizes bodhisattva compassion.

⁸ **[Sanskrit]** *durbhikṣāntarakalpa*: The intermediate famine aeons—periods of cosmic decline marked by shortage and suffering.

⁹ **[Sanskrit]** *nidhiḥ akṣaya*: Inexhaustible treasury. The bodhisattva aspires to be a limitless source of provisions.

¹⁰ **[Philosophical]** The three types of giving: self (*ātmabhāva*), possessions (*bhoga*), and merit (*śubha*). "Of the three times" indicates past, present, and future merit.

¹¹ **[Philosophical]** A profound equation: if nirvāṇa requires letting go of everything, then giving to beings accomplishes the same goal while benefiting others.

¹² **[Sanskrit]** *sukhīkṛta*: "Rendered happy" or "made available for happiness." The self is given over entirely for others' benefit.

¹³ **[Sanskrit]** *anarthaḥ kasyacit mā bhūt māmālambya*: "May no harm come to anyone taking me as a basis"—even when used by others.

¹⁴ **[Philosophical]** The radical extension: whether beings approach with anger or affection, may their relationship with the bodhisattva lead to the fulfillment of their aims.

¹⁵ **[Sanskrit]** *bodhibhāginaḥ*: "Sharers in awakening"—even those who slander or harm.

¹⁶ **[Cross-reference]** This verse parallels similar aspirations in the *Bhadracaryāpraṇidhāna*. The series—protector, guide, boat, bridge, causeway—covers all modes of assistance.

¹⁷ **[Sanskrit]** *cintāmaṇi*: The wish-fulfilling jewel of Indian mythology.

¹⁸ **[Sanskrit]** *bhadraghaṭa*: The excellent or auspicious vase, a ritual vessel of abundance.

¹⁹ **[Sanskrit]** *kalpavṛkṣa* and *kāmadhenu*: The wish-granting tree and the cow of desires—mythological sources of inexhaustible abundance.

²⁰ **[Philosophical]** The aspiration extends "until all have attained nirvāṇa"—the open-ended commitment characteristic of bodhicitta.

²¹ **[Cross-reference]** The phrase "just as...so too" (*yathā...tadvat*) marks the formal ritual of taking the bodhisattva vow, modeled on the Buddhas' own practice.

²² **[Sanskrit]** *śikṣiṣyāmi yathākramam*: "I shall train in their proper sequence"—the graduated path of bodhisattva practice.

²³ **[Sanskrit]** *puṣṭyartham*: For the purpose of strengthening or nourishing what has been adopted.

²⁴ **[Philosophical]** This exultation (*adya me saphalaṃ janma*) parallels liturgical formulas in ordination ceremonies. "Today" (*adya*) marks the transformative moment.

²⁵ **[Sanskrit]** *svakulocitakārin*: Actions befitting one's own family—the bodhisattva lineage.

²⁶ **[Sanskrit]** *saṃkārakūṭa*: Heap of refuse or rubbish. The blind person finding treasure is a powerful metaphor for the unlikely arising of bodhicitta in an ordinary being.

²⁷ **[Sanskrit]** *mṛtyuvināśa*: Destruction of death—bodhicitta destroys not just physical death but the cycle of birth and death.

²⁸ **[Sanskrit]** *bhavādhvabhramaṇaśrānta*: Exhausted from wandering on the paths of existence (*bhava*).

²⁹ **[Sanskrit]** *durgatyuttaraṇe setuḥ sāmānyaḥ*: A public (*sāmānya*) bridge for crossing out of the lower realms—available to all.

³⁰ **[Philosophical]** The churning metaphor: just as butter is the pure essence extracted from milk, bodhicitta is the pure essence extracted from the Dharma.

³¹ **[Sanskrit]** *sukhasattra*: Feast of happiness. *Sattra* is a charitable feast or distribution.

³² **[Sanskrit]** *sugatatva*: "Sugatahood"—the state of being a Buddha. "In the meantime" (*antarā*) refers to the happiness of the path.

## Metrical Notes

- **Verses 1–31**: *Anuṣṭubh* meter (8 syllables per quarter)
