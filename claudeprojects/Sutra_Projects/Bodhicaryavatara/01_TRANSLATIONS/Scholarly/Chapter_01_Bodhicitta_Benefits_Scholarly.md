# Chapter 1: The Benefits of Bodhicitta

## Bodhicittānuśaṃsaḥ — बोधिचित्तानुशंसः

*A Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel*

## I. Opening Homage and Statement of Purpose

### Verses 1–3: Invocation and Authorial Humility

**Verse 1**
> *oṃ namo buddhāya*
>
> Having reverently bowed to the Sugatas¹ together with their spiritual heirs,² to those endowed with the Dharmakāya,³ and to all who are worthy of veneration, I shall set forth, in accordance with scripture and in brief, the descent into the vow⁴ of the offspring of the Sugatas.

**Verse 2**
> There is nothing new to be said here, nor do I possess any skill in literary composition. Therefore, I have no thought for the benefit of others—I have composed this merely to perfume⁵ my own mind.

**Verse 3**
> For me, at least, through this work the momentum of faith⁶ for cultivating virtue increases. And should another of similar disposition see this, then it too may prove beneficial.

---

## II. The Precious Human Life

### Verses 4–6: Opportunity and Urgency

**Verse 4**
> This conjunction of favorable conditions,⁷ so exceedingly difficult to obtain, having been obtained, is capable of accomplishing the purpose of human existence.⁸ If benefit is not contemplated here and now, how will such a conjunction come again?

**Verse 5**
> Just as lightning, during the night, in the thick darkness of clouds, momentarily reveals brightness—so too, through the influence of the Buddhas, the mind of the world might occasionally, for an instant, turn toward meritorious actions.⁹

**Verse 6**
> Thus virtue is always weak, while the power of negativity is vast and exceedingly terrible. By what other virtue could it be conquered, were it not for the complete awakening mind?¹⁰

---

## III. The Efficacy of Bodhicitta

### Verses 7–14: Transformative Power

**Verse 7**
> The Lords of Sages,¹¹ contemplating for countless aeons, have seen this alone to be beneficial: through it, happiness, having easily increased, causes immeasurable floods of beings to overflow with joy.

**Verse 8**
> For those who wish to cross over the hundreds of sufferings of existence, for those who wish to remove the miseries of sentient beings, for those who wish to experience hundreds of happinesses—bodhicitta must never be abandoned.

**Verse 9**
> The wretched one, bound as a prisoner in the rounds of existence,¹² is called a "child of the Sugatas" the very instant bodhicitta arises. Such a one becomes worthy of veneration by the worlds of humans and gods.

**Verse 10**
> Taking hold of this impure form,¹³ it transforms it into the priceless image of the Victor's jewel. Grasp firmly this elixir¹⁴ known as bodhicitta, which is to be penetrated.

**Verse 11**
> Thoroughly examined by those of immeasurable wisdom,¹⁵ the sole caravan leaders of the world, and found to be of great value—you who are disposed to wander from destination to destination,¹⁶ grasp firmly this jewel of bodhicitta.

**Verse 12**
> Like the plantain tree¹⁷ that perishes after bearing fruit, all other virtues decay and are exhausted. But the tree of bodhicitta continually bears fruit and, never depleted, only grows.

**Verse 13**
> Though one has committed terrible misdeeds, one crosses beyond them instantly through reliance upon it—just as one escapes great dangers through reliance upon a hero. Why then is it not embraced by those who are ignorant?

**Verse 14**
> Like the fire at the end of an aeon,¹⁸ it incinerates great misdeeds in an instant. Its immeasurable benefits Lord Maitreya¹⁹ declared to the wise Sudhana.

## IV. The Two Types of Bodhicitta

### Verses 15–20: Aspiration and Application

**Verse 15**
> That bodhicitta is to be understood, in brief, as twofold: the mind of aspiration to awakening²⁰ and the mind of venturing forth toward awakening.²¹

**Verse 16**
> Just as the distinction is understood between one who wishes to go and one who is going, so too should the distinction between these two be understood by the wise, in that order.

**Verse 17**
> Great is the fruit of the aspiring bodhicitta even in saṃsāra, yet it does not produce uninterrupted merit as does the mind that has set forth.

**Verse 18**
> From the moment one takes up that mind with irreversible intention for the complete liberation of the limitless realm of sentient beings—

**Verse 19**
> —from that moment onward, whether asleep or distracted, uninterrupted streams of merit,²² vast as space, continually pour forth.

**Verse 20**
> The Tathāgata himself declared this, with supporting reasoning, in the *Subāhupṛcchā*,²³ for the sake of beings inclined toward lesser aspirations.

---

## V. The Immeasurable Merit of Bodhicitta

### Verses 21–27: Surpassing All Other Virtues

**Verse 21**
> One who, with a benevolent intention, thinks "I shall remove the headaches of beings"²⁴—such a one is grasped by immeasurable merit.

**Verse 22**
> How much more so one who wishes to remove the incomparable suffering of each and every being, and who wishes to accomplish immeasurable qualities for each?

**Verse 23**
> What mother or father has such benevolent intention? Do the gods, the ṛṣis,²⁵ or the Brahmās possess it?

**Verse 24**
> For those very beings, even this wish for their own benefit has never arisen before, even in dreams. How then could it arise for the sake of others?

**Verse 25**
> How does this extraordinary jewel among beings²⁶ arise—this intention for the benefit of others that does not arise even for their own benefit?

**Verse 26**
> How can the merit of this jewel-mind²⁷—the seed of the world's joy, the medicine for the world's suffering—be measured?

**Verse 27**
> Merely by aspiring for the benefit of others, one's worship of the Buddha is surpassed.²⁸ How much more so by striving for the complete happiness of all beings?

---

## VI. The Tragedy of Ordinary Beings

### Verses 28–31: The Paradox of Self-Harm

**Verse 28**
> Desiring to escape from suffering, they run toward suffering itself.²⁹ With the very desire for happiness, out of delusion they destroy their own happiness as if it were an enemy.

**Verse 29**
> For those who are starved for happiness and afflicted in so many ways—the bodhisattva satisfies them with all happinesses and cuts off all their afflictions.

**Verse 30**
> Such a one destroys even delusion. Where is there another equally good? Where is there such a friend, such merit?

**Verse 31**
> One who returns a favor is praised. What then need be said of the bodhisattva, who acts beneficently without expectation?³⁰

---

## VII. The Supreme Generosity of the Bodhisattva

### Verses 32–35: Incomparable Gift

**Verse 32**
> One who gives a meal to a few people—doing so contemptuously, providing mere sustenance for half a day—is honored by people as one who has done a virtuous deed.

**Verse 33**
> How much more so one who, for an immeasurable multitude of beings, throughout limitless time, bestows the inexhaustible fulfillment of all wishes—for beings as numerous as the reaches of space?

**Verse 34**
> Concerning such a lord of the feast,³¹ a child of the Victor: whosoever engenders hostility in their heart, they shall dwell in the hells for as many aeons as the moments of hostility—so the Lord declared.

**Verse 35**
> But one whose mind attains faith—the fruit produced thereby exceeds even that. For negativity requires great force against the children of the Victors, while virtue arises effortlessly.³²

---

## VIII. Concluding Homage

### Verse 36: Taking Refuge

**Verse 36**
> I pay homage to those beings³³ in whom that excellent jewel-mind has arisen. I go for refuge to those sources of happiness, through whom even injury becomes a bond to happiness.³⁴

---

*Thus concludes the first chapter, entitled "The Benefits of Bodhicitta," in the* Bodhicaryāvatāra *composed by the noble Śāntideva.*

# Scholarly Apparatus

## Footnotes

¹ **[Sanskrit]** *sugata* (सुगत): "Well-Gone One," an epithet of the Buddha emphasizing the completion of the path. The plural indicates all Buddhas of the three times.

² **[Sanskrit]** *sasutān*: "together with their sons/heirs," i.e., the bodhisattvas who are spiritually descended from the Buddhas.

³ **[Sanskrit]** *sadharmakāyān*: "endowed with the Dharmakāya." This early usage of the term refers to the corpus of Buddhist teachings embodied by awakened beings, rather than the later three-body (trikāya) technical meaning.

⁴ **[Sanskrit]** *saṃvarāvatāra* (संवरावतार): Descent into the vow. *Saṃvara* refers to the ethical restraint or vow; *avatāra* to descent or entry.

⁵ **[Sanskrit]** *vāsayitum*: To perfume, to habituate, to satisfy. The term *vāsanā* (habitual tendency) derives from the same root. "Perfume" captures the sense of gradual permeation, like scent permeating cloth.

⁶ **[Sanskrit]** *prasādavega*: The momentum or force (*vega*) of faith/devotion (*prasāda*). Faith here is not blind belief but lucid confidence born of understanding.

⁷ **[Sanskrit]** *kṣaṇasaṃpad*: "The wealth/endowment of the moment." This refers to the eight freedoms (*akṣaṇa*) and ten endowments (*saṃpatti*) that constitute a "precious human birth."

⁸ **[Sanskrit]** *puruṣārthasādhanī*: Capable of accomplishing *puruṣārtha*, the purpose of human existence—here understood as liberation and full awakening.

⁹ **[Philosophical]** The simile of lightning in darkness is a powerful image of the rarity and brevity of human inclination toward virtue. The Buddhist tradition consistently emphasizes that wholesome mental states are fragile and require intentional cultivation.

¹⁰ **[Sanskrit]** *saṃbodhicitta*: The complete awakening mind. This verse establishes bodhicitta as the only antidote powerful enough to overcome accumulated negativity.

¹¹ **[Sanskrit]** *munīndra*: "Lords of Sages," i.e., the Buddhas.

¹² **[Sanskrit]** *bhavacārakabandhana*: Bound as a wanderer in *bhava* (becoming/existence). The prison metaphor for saṃsāra is common throughout Buddhist literature.

¹³ **[Sanskrit]** *aśucipratimā*: The "impure image," referring to the ordinary human body-mind complex, here transformed by bodhicitta.

¹⁴ **[Sanskrit]** *rasajāta*: Literally "essence-born," referring to the alchemical elixir (*rasāyana*) that transmutes base metals into gold. The term *vedhanīya* ("to be penetrated") preserves the alchemical metaphor—bodhicitta penetrates and transforms the practitioner, not merely refining but fundamentally transmuting.

¹⁵ **[Sanskrit]** *aprameyadhī*: Those of immeasurable wisdom, i.e., the Buddhas.

¹⁶ **[Sanskrit]** *gatipattanavipravāsaśīlāḥ*: Those habituated to exile from destination-ports, i.e., wandering beings who journey from rebirth to rebirth.

¹⁷ **[Philosophical]** The plantain/banana tree (*kadalī*) was understood to die after fruiting. This simile emphasizes that ordinary virtues, however great, are exhausted when their karmic fruit ripens, while bodhicitta's merit is inexhaustible.

¹⁸ **[Sanskrit]** *yugāntakālānala*: The fire at the end of the cosmic age (*yuga*-end *kāla*-fire). This conflagration destroys the world-system between cosmic cycles.

¹⁹ **[Cross-reference]** Lord Maitreya's teaching to Sudhana is found in the *Gaṇḍavyūha-sūtra*, the final section of the vast *Avataṃsaka-sūtra*, where Maitreya expounds the benefits of bodhicitta in extensive detail.

²⁰ **[Sanskrit]** *bodhipraṇidhicitta*: The aspiring or wishing bodhicitta—the resolve to attain awakening for the benefit of all beings.

²¹ **[Sanskrit]** *bodhiprasthāna*: The venturing-forth or application bodhicitta—the actual engagement in bodhisattva conduct.

²² **[Sanskrit]** *puṇyadhārā*: Streams of merit. The metaphor of flowing water emphasizes the continuous, effortless nature of merit generation once application bodhicitta is established.

²³ **[Cross-reference]** *Subāhupṛcchā*: "The Questions of Subāhu," a sūtra in which the Buddha addresses the benefits of the aspiring mind even for those of limited capacity.

²⁴ **[Philosophical]** The headache metaphor establishes a baseline: even the minor intention to relieve minor suffering generates immense merit. The progression from verses 21–22 moves from minor to cosmic scale.

²⁵ **[Sanskrit]** *ṛṣi* (ऋषि): Seers or sages, referring in Buddhist context to the spiritually accomplished beings revered in both Buddhist and Brahmanical traditions.

²⁶ **[Sanskrit]** *sattvaratnaviśeṣa*: The extraordinary jewel among beings—the bodhisattva.

²⁷ **[Sanskrit]** *cittaratna*: The jewel-mind, i.e., bodhicitta.

²⁸ **[Philosophical]** This verse establishes the hierarchy: even aspiration surpasses ordinary Buddha-worship, while active bodhisattva practice surpasses even that.

²⁹ **[Modern]** This verse anticipates modern psychological insights about self-defeating behavior patterns. The paradox of running toward what harms us while fleeing what benefits us is central to Buddhist analysis of delusion (*moha*).

³⁰ **[Sanskrit]** *avyāpāritasādhu*: The bodhisattva who acts beneficently (*sādhu*) without being prompted or asked (*avyāpārita*)—indicating the spontaneous, unconditional nature of bodhisattva compassion.

³¹ **[Sanskrit]** *sattrapati*: Lord of the feast, host of the charitable distribution (*sattra*). The bodhisattva is likened to a supreme host who gives not mere food for half a day, but inexhaustible fulfillment.

³² **[Philosophical]** The asymmetry between virtue and negativity toward bodhisattvas: hostility generates massive karmic debt, while faith generates immense merit. This emphasizes the extraordinary spiritual status of those who have generated bodhicitta.

³³ **[Sanskrit]** *teṣāṃ śarīrāṇi*: "Their bodies"—Śāntideva offers physical homage to the very embodied forms in which bodhicitta has arisen.

³⁴ **[Philosophical]** The final verse encapsulates the bodhisattva paradox: even harm received by such beings becomes a cause of happiness, because their compassionate response transforms suffering into the path.

## Metrical Notes

- **Verses 1–14, 32–36**: Composed in *vaṃśastha* (वंशस्थ) meter, a variety of *jagatī* with 12 syllables per quarter.
- **Verses 15–31**: Composed in *anuṣṭubh* (अनुष्टुभ्), the standard 32-syllable meter with 8 syllables per quarter.

The shift from the more elaborate *vaṃśastha* in the opening and closing sections to the simpler *anuṣṭubh* in the doctrinal core may reflect the text's original composition for oral recitation and memorization.
