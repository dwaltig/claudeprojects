## I. Opening Dedication

### Verses 1–10: For All Beings

**Verse 1**
> Through the virtue of my contemplating the *Bodhicaryāvatāra*, may all beings become adorned with the bodhisattva conduct.

**Verse 2**
> May all beings in all directions who are afflicted with suffering of body and mind obtain, through my merit, oceans of joy and happiness.

**Verse 3**
> As long as they remain in saṃsāra, may their happiness never decrease. May the world attain the uninterrupted happiness of the bodhisattvas.

**Verse 4**
> In all the world-systems, may beings in the hells delight in the joys and delights of Sukhāvatī.¹

**Verse 5**
> May those suffering from cold obtain warmth. May those suffering from heat become cool, through oceans of water arising from the great clouds of the bodhisattvas.

**Verse 6**
> May the sword-leaf forest become a Nandana grove for them. May the Kūṭaśālmalī trees² become wish-fulfilling trees.

**Verse 7**
> May the hell-realms become delightful, with ponds beautified by the sounds of cranes, ruddy geese, cakravāka birds, and swans, fragrant with the scent of abundant lotuses.

**Verse 8**
> May the heap of burning coals become a heap of jewels. May the burning ground become crystal flooring. May the crushing mountains become palaces of worship filled with Sugatas.

**Verse 9**
> May the rain of burning coals, lava, and weapons become from now on a rain of flowers. May the mutual fighting with weapons become, from now on, playful fighting with flowers.

**Verse 10**
> May those sunk in the Vaitaraṇī River,³ bodies of white bone with all flesh fallen, skins cooked as in blazing fire—may they, by the power of my virtue, obtain divine bodies and dwell with divine maidens in the Mandākinī River.

## II. Liberation from Hell

### Verses 11–18: Vision of the Bodhisattvas

**Verse 11**
> "The servants of Yama, the crows, and the vultures are suddenly terrified—whence is this gentle radiance filling the sky with bliss, the darkness destroyed on all sides?" Looking upward, seeing the blazing Vajrapāṇi⁴ in the sky, may they, through the force of joy, with faults departed, go with him.

**Verse 12**
> May a rain of lotuses fall, mixed with fragrant water, visibly extinguishing the fire of hell. "What is this? Happiness has refreshed me!" May the sight of Kamala-pāṇi ("Lotus-Hand")⁵ come to those in hell.

**Verse 13**
> "Come, come quickly! Cast away fear, brothers! We are alive! A certain radiant, crested youth has arrived among us, giving fearlessness—by whose power all calamities have departed, streams of delight flow, bodhicitta is born, and compassion, the mother who rescues all people."

**Verse 14**
> "Look! This one whose lotus-feet are worshipped with the crowns of hundreds of gods, whose eyes are moist with compassion, on whose head falls a rain of many flowers, whose charming kūṭāgāra-palaces are filled with thousands of goddesses singing praises—seeing Mañjughoṣa before them, may there be jubilation now among those in hell!"⁶

> May the hungry ghosts be filled, may they be bathed and cooled forever, by the streams of milk flowing from the hand of noble Avalokiteśvara.⁷
