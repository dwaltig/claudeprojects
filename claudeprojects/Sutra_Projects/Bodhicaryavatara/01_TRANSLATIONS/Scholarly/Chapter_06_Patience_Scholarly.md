## I. The Destructive Power of Anger

### Verses 1–8: Anger Destroys Everything

**Verse 1**
> All this excellent conduct—generosity, worship of the Sugatas—performed over thousands of aeons, a single moment of hatred destroys.¹

**Verse 2**
> There is no evil equal to hatred, and no austerity equal to patience.² Therefore one should cultivate patience diligently, through various methods.

**Verse 3**
> The mind does not grasp peace, does not experience pleasure and happiness, does not find sleep or stability, when the thorn of hatred is lodged in the heart.³

**Verse 4**
> Even those whom one benefits with wealth and honors, who depend on one, wish to kill a lord who is miserable through hatred.

**Verse 5**
> Even friends shrink from him. He gives but is not served. In short, there is nothing by which the angry person is well-situated.

**Verse 6**
> Knowing thus that hatred creates such suffering—whoever destroys hatred steadfastly is happy here and hereafter.

**Verse 7**
> Having obtained the food of mental distress from the obstruction of what is desired and from the occurrence of what is not desired, hatred grows arrogant and destroys me.

**Verse 8**
> Therefore I shall destroy the food of that enemy. For that enemy has no other business than slaying me.

## II. The Logic of Acceptance

### Verses 9–21: Why Grief Is Pointless

**Verse 9**
> Even by the occurrence of the extremely undesirable, my cheerfulness should not be disturbed. Even in mental distress there is nothing wanted; and virtue deteriorates.

**Verse 10**
> If there is a remedy, what use is grief about it? And if there is no remedy, what use is grief about it?⁴

**Verse 11**
> Suffering, contempt, harsh words, disgrace—these are unwished for by us and our dear ones; for our enemies, the opposite.

**Verse 12**
> Happiness is obtained somehow with difficulty; suffering remains without effort. It is only through suffering that liberation is achieved. Therefore, mind, be steadfast!

**Verse 13**
> The devotees of Durgā⁵ and the people of Karṇāṭa endure the pain of burning and cutting pointlessly, for the sake of liberation. Why then am I timid?

**Verse 14**
> There is nothing that is difficult through practice. Therefore, through practice of mild discomfort, even great discomfort becomes bearable.

**Verse 15**
> Do you not see as meaningless the discomfort of biting gnats and flies, hunger and thirst, and great suffering such as itching?

**Verse 16**
> Cold, heat, rain, wind, illness, bondage, and blows—one should not be delicate about these. Otherwise discomfort increases.

**Verse 17**
> Some, seeing their own blood, become even more courageous. But others, seeing even another's blood, fall into a faint.

**Verse 18**
> This comes from firmness or timidity of mind. Therefore one should become unconquerable by suffering and should overcome discomfort.

**Verse 19**
> Even in suffering, the wise one should not disturb the serenity of the mind. For there is battle with the afflictions, and in battle discomfort is easily obtained.

**Verse 20**
> Those who, receiving the blows of enemies on their chests, conquer their enemies—they are the victorious heroes. The rest are merely corpse-slayers.

**Verse 21**
> Another merit of suffering is that through disenchantment, pride falls away, compassion arises for those in saṃsāra, fear of evil, and longing for the Victor.

## III. Understanding the Mechanics of Harm

### Verses 22–33: No One Is Truly to Blame

**Verse 22**
> I am not angry at bile and the rest, even though they are great causes of suffering. Why then be angry at sentient beings? They too are provoked by conditions.⁶

**Verse 23**
> Just as this pain arises unwished for, so too anger arises forcefully, though unwished for.

**Verse 24**
> A person does not become angry thinking "I shall become angry." And anger does not arise intending "I shall arise."

**Verse 25**
> Whatever offenses there are, and whatever various evils—all arise through the force of conditions. There is nothing that is independent.

**Verse 26**
> The collection of conditions does not have the thought "I shall produce." Nor does what is produced have the thought "I was produced."

**Verse 27**
> That which is called the "primal" and is desired as the self—even that does not arise thinking "I shall come into being."

**Verse 28**
> For what is not arisen does not exist. Who then would wish to come into being? And since it is occupied with objects, it does not even exert itself to cease.

**Verse 29**
> If the self is permanent and non-conscious, like space, it is clearly without action. Even in connection with other conditions, what action is there for what is unchanging?

**Verse 30**
> If at the time of action it is the same as before, what is done by it through action? If there is a connection of action to it, which one is the basis of that?

**Verse 31**
> Thus everything is dependent on another, and that upon which it depends is itself not independent. When beings are like magical creations without volition, at whom should one be angry?⁷

**Verse 32**
> If one objects: "Even so, warding off anger is not appropriate. For who wards off what?"—it is appropriate, since there is dependent origination and cessation of suffering is accepted.

**Verse 33**
> Therefore, seeing either enemy or friend acting wrongly, reflecting "Such are his conditions," one should be happy.⁸

## IV. The Futility of Beings' Wishes

### Verses 34–40: They Cannot Help Themselves

**Verse 34**
> If all embodied beings achieved their goals just by wishing, no one would have any suffering, for no one wishes to suffer.

**Verse 35**
> Through carelessness, people injure themselves with thorns and the like, through anger with fasting, and through desire for unattainable women.

**Verse 36**
> Some kill themselves by hanging, by throwing themselves off cliffs, by eating poison and unwholesome things, and by non-meritorious conduct.

**Verse 37**
> If, when overcome by afflictions, they kill even the beloved self, how could there be restraint toward the bodies of others?

**Verse 38**
> Toward those maddened by afflictions, engaged in killing themselves—not only is there no compassion, but anger arises. How?

**Verse 39**
> If it is the nature of fools to cause harm to others, anger toward them is not appropriate—just as toward fire, whose nature is to burn.

**Verse 40**
> And if this fault is adventitious and beings are by nature gentle, anger toward them is equally inappropriate—like anger at the sky for acrid smoke.

---

## V. Taking Responsibility

### Verses 41–51: I Brought This on Myself

**Verse 41**
> If, ignoring the main cause such as the stick, one is angry at the inciter, that one too is incited by hatred. Better that I be angry at hatred.

**Verse 42**
> In the past I too have caused such harm to sentient beings. Therefore it is right for me—who harm beings—to receive this.⁹

**Verse 43**
> Both his weapon and my body are causes of suffering. He took up the weapon; I took up the body. At which should I be angry?

**Verse 44**
> This body-boil, shaped like a person, taken by me, unable to bear touch—blinded by craving, at which should I be angry when it suffers?

**Verse 45**
> I do not wish for suffering, yet foolishly I wish for its cause. When suffering comes through my own fault, why be angry at another?

**Verse 46**
> Just as the sword-leaf forest, and just as the hell-birds—these are produced by my own karma. At what should I be angry?

**Verse 47**
> Impelled by my karma alone, those who harm me have arisen. By that they will go to hells. Have they not been slain by me?

**Verse 48**
> Relying on these, much of my sin is destroyed through patience. But relying on me, these go to hells of long suffering.

**Verse 49**
> I am the one who has harmed these beings, and these are my benefactors. Having reversed this, why do you, O wicked mind, become angry?¹⁰

**Verse 50**
> If there is merit in my intention, I shall not go to hells. If the self is protected by me, what comes to these from that?

**Verse 51**
> And if I were to retaliate, even so, these would not be protected. My conduct would be impaired, and thus these ascetics would be ruined.

## VI. What Harm Can Words Do?

### Verses 52–68: Analyzing the Nature of Harm

**Verse 52**
> Since the mind is formless, it cannot be harmed by anyone anywhere. But through attachment to the body, it is afflicted by bodily suffering.

**Verse 53**
> Contempt, harsh speech, disgrace—this group does not harm the body. Why then, mind, do you become angry?

**Verse 54**
> Will others' displeasure toward me devour me, either in this life or in another, that it is unwanted by me?

**Verse 55**
> If it is unwanted because it causes obstruction to gain—my gain will perish here; my sin will remain firmly.

**Verse 56**
> Better that death come to me today than a long life through wrong livelihood. For even after living long, there is still the suffering of death for me.

**Verse 57**
> One person, having enjoyed happiness for a hundred years in a dream, wakes up. Another, having been happy for a moment, wakes up.

**Verse 58**
> Surely happiness ceases for both who have awakened. It is just so at the time of death for one who lived long and one who lived briefly.

**Verse 59**
> Even after obtaining many gains and enjoying pleasures for a long time, I shall go empty-handed and naked, like one who was robbed.

**Verse 60**
> If through gain I live and destroy sin and do merit—is it not the case that one who is angry for the sake of gain destroys merit and does sin?

**Verse 61**
> If the very purpose for which I live perishes—what is the use of a life that only does evil?

**Verse 62**
> If one objects: "Hatred toward the one who speaks ill destroys beings"—why does your anger not arise also toward one who speaks ill of another?

**Verse 63**
> Your patience toward those who are displeased with another is explained by their dependence on conditions—but there is no patience toward one who speaks ill of you, who is dependent on the arising of afflictions.

**Verse 64**
> Toward those who destroy or slander images, stūpas, or the true Dharma, it is not appropriate for me to be angry, for the Buddhas and the rest are not harmed.

**Verse 65**
> Toward those who harm teachers, relatives, and dear ones, seeing that this arises from conditions as before, one should ward off anger.

**Verse 66**
> Harm to embodied beings is certainly made by both conscious and non-conscious causes. That harm is seen in the conscious one. Therefore be patient with this harm.

**Verse 67**
> Some offend through delusion; others, also deluded, become angry. Which of these do we call blameless? Which do we call blameworthy?

**Verse 68**
> Why did I act thus before, that I am now harmed by others in this way? All are dependent on karma. Who am I to alter this?

---

## VII. Working Toward Universal Friendliness

### Verses 69–75: The Path Forward

**Verse 69**
> Having understood this, I thus make effort toward merit, so that all will become friendly-minded toward each other.

**Verse 70**
> When a house is burning, and fire has gone from it to another house, one should remove and throw away the straw and such where it might spread.

**Verse 71**
> So too, when the mind is burned by the fire of hatred through attachment, at that moment one should abandon it, fearing the burning up of the body of merit.

**Verse 72**
> If one who is to be killed is cut free and released, what misfortune is that? If one is freed from human suffering and hells, what misfortune?

**Verse 73**
> If even this mere suffering today cannot be endured, why is anger—the cause of hell-suffering—not warded off?

**Verse 74**
> For the sake of anger, I have been tortured in hells thousands of times, having achieved neither my own purpose nor the purpose of others.

**Verse 75**
> But this is not such suffering, and it will accomplish a great purpose. Here, suffering that removes the suffering of the world should bring only joy.

---

## VIII. Rejoicing in Others' Good Fortune

### Verses 76–89: Overcoming Jealousy

**Verse 76**
> If others have obtained pleasure and happiness through praising one rich in virtues, mind, you too, praising him—why do you not rejoice thus?

**Verse 77**
> This joy-happiness of yours is blameless, a source of happiness, not prohibited by the virtuous—the best way of winning over others.

**Verse 78**
> If you object: "This is his happiness alone"—then if this is not pleasing to you, both visible and invisible results are destroyed by ceasing to pay wages and such.

**Verse 79**
> When your own virtue is being proclaimed, you want others' happiness too. When another's virtue is being proclaimed, you do not want even your own happiness.

**Verse 80**
> Having generated bodhicitta out of desire for the happiness of all beings, why do you now become angry at beings who have obtained happiness by themselves?

**Verse 81**
> Do you not wish buddhahood—which is worshipped by the three worlds—for beings? Why are you burned seeing their transitory honor?

**Verse 82**
> One who nourishes him whom you should nourish—he gives to you yourself. Having found one who supports his family, you do not rejoice but become angry.

**Verse 83**
> For one who wishes awakening for beings, does he not wish this? Where is the bodhicitta of one who is angry at another's prosperity?

**Verse 84**
> If it was not received by him, it remains in the benefactor's house. In any case it is not yours. What does it matter to you whether it is given or not given?

**Verse 85**
> Should he obstruct his merit, his admirers, his own virtues? Should he, when receiving, not accept? Tell me, at whom are you not angry?

**Verse 86**
> Not only do you not grieve for yourself who have done evil, but you want to compete with those who have done merit.

**Verse 87**
> If something unpleasant has arisen for your enemy, what will come of your satisfaction? Your mere wish will not become a cause without that.

**Verse 88**
> And if it were accomplished by your wish—what happiness is there in his suffering for you? Even if there were purpose, what misfortune could be greater than this?

**Verse 89**
> For this is the terrible hook cast by the fishermen of afflictions—from which, having purchased you, the hell-guardians will cook you in pots.

## IX. The Worthlessness of Praise and Blame

### Verses 90–101: Fame Is Nothing

**Verse 90**
> Praise, fame, and honor are not for merit, not for longevity, not for strength, not for health, not for bodily comfort to me.

**Verse 91**
> This much would be one's own purpose for a wise person who knows his own purpose. Should gambling and drinking be resorted to by one who wishes mental happiness?

**Verse 92**
> For the sake of fame, some give away wealth and even kill themselves. What can syllables be eaten? And when one is dead, whose is that happiness?

**Verse 93**
> Just as a child cries distressfully when his sand castle is broken, so does my mind appear to me when praise and fame are lost.

**Verse 94**
> A word, lacking consciousness—it is impossible that it praises me. "Another is pleased in me"—if this is the cause of my joy—

**Verse 95**
> —what is the use to me of another's joy, whether in me or in another? The pleasure-happiness is his alone. Not even a small portion of it is mine.

**Verse 96**
> If my happiness is through his happiness, this should be so always everywhere. Why is there no happiness for me when others are happy through the favor of another?

**Verse 97**
> Therefore, the joy that arises in me thinking "I am praised"—even that, being unconnected, is merely childish behavior.

**Verse 98**
> Praise and the rest disturb my equanimity, destroy my disenchantment, create jealousy toward the virtuous, and anger at success.

**Verse 99**
> Therefore, those who are present for the destruction of my praise and the rest—are they not engaged in protecting me from falling to lower realms?

**Verse 100**
> It is inappropriate for me, who seeks liberation, to be bound by gain and honor. Those who free me from bondage—how can I be angry at them?

**Verse 101**
> For one who wishes to enter suffering, those who have become like a door—as if by the Buddha's blessing—how can I be angry at them?

---

## X. The Preciousness of Enemies

### Verses 102–111: Enemies as Teachers

**Verse 102**
> If one objects: "He has created an obstacle to merit"—anger is not appropriate here. There is no austerity equal to patience—surely this has arrived.

**Verse 103**
> And if through my own fault I do not practice patience here, then the obstacle to merit has been created by me alone, when the cause was present.

**Verse 104**
> That without which something does not exist and on the existence of which it exists—that is indeed its cause. How is it called an obstacle?

**Verse 105**
> An obstacle to generosity is not made by a suppliant who appeared at the proper time. And when one seeking ordination arrives, it is not called an obstacle to ordination.

**Verse 106**
> Those who beg are easily found in the world, but those who harm are difficult to find. For if I have not offended, no one will offend me.¹¹

**Verse 107**
> Therefore, the enemy, having arisen in my house like a treasure acquired without effort, should be cherished by me as a helper in the bodhisattva conduct.¹²

**Verse 108**
> The fruit of patience is obtained by me and by him. Therefore, to him first should it be given, for patience came first from him.

**Verse 109**
> If one objects: "He has no intention of accomplishing patience, therefore the enemy is not to be honored"—then why is the true Dharma honored, though it is a suitable cause of accomplishment?

**Verse 110**
> If one objects: "The enemy is not to be honored because his intention is to harm"—how else would I have patience, as toward a physician intent on benefit?

**Verse 111**
> It is precisely in dependence on his hostile intention that patience arises. Therefore he is the cause of patience and should be honored by me like the true Dharma.

---

## XI. The Field of Beings

### Verses 112–123: Beings Equal Buddhas

**Verse 112**
> Therefore the Sage said that the field of beings and the field of the Victors are alike. For many have gone to the far shore of attainment by pleasing them.¹³

**Verse 113**
> When the acquisition of Buddha-qualities from beings and from Victors is equal, what logic is there in not treating beings with the same respect as Victors?

**Verse 114**
> The greatness of intention is not from itself but from its effect. Therefore the greatness of beings is equal, and thus they are equal.

**Verse 115**
> The friendliness of intention is what is worthy of honor—that is the greatness of beings. And the merit from pleasing the Buddha—that is the greatness of the Buddha.

**Verse 116**
> Therefore beings are equal to Victors in the portion of contributing to Buddha-qualities. But none are equal to Buddhas, who are oceans of virtue with infinite portions.

**Verse 117**
> If even a particle of virtue were seen anywhere in those who are a unique collection of the essence of virtues, even the three worlds would not be sufficient for its worship.

**Verse 118**
> But in beings there exists the best portion of giving rise to Buddha-qualities. In proportion to that portion, worship of beings should be made.

**Verse 119**
> Moreover, for genuine kinsmen of immeasurable benefit, what other repayment could there be than pleasing beings?

**Verse 120**
> For their sake bodies are torn apart and one enters Avīci—when that is done for them, that is done. Therefore one should do only good toward these, even though they are great offenders.

**Verse 121**
> My lords themselves, for their own sake, are unconcerned even for their own selves. How can I act with pride toward these lords and not with servitude?

**Verse 122**
> From the happiness of beings comes the joy of the Lords of Sages; at their suffering they enter into anger. From pleasing them comes the delight of all the Lords of Sages; harm to them is harm to the Sages.

**Verse 123**
> Just as there is no mental happiness for one whose body is completely on fire, even with all pleasures—so too, for those who are made of compassion, there is no means of joy when beings suffer.

---

## XII. Final Confession and Vow

### Verses 124–134: The Supreme Practice

**Verse 124**
> Therefore, whatever suffering I have caused to all the greatly compassionate ones by harming beings—today I confess that sin. May the Sages forgive that which has distressed them.

**Verse 125**
> In order to please the Tathāgatas, today I enter into servitude to the world with my entire self. Let the multitudes of beings place their feet on my head or strike me. May the Lord of the World be pleased.

**Verse 126**
> That the compassionate ones have made this entire world their own—of this there is no doubt. Those who are seen in the form of beings—they themselves are the Protectors. Why this disrespect here?

**Verse 127**
> This is the way to please the Tathāgatas. This is the way to accomplish one's own welfare. This is the way to remove the suffering of the world. Therefore let this be my vow.¹⁴

**Verse 128**
> Just as a single king's officer overpowers a great people, the great people are unable to resist—for they are far-seeing.

**Verse 129**
> For he is not alone; his power is the king's power. So too, one should not despise any offender who is weak.

**Verse 130**
> For the hell-guardians and the compassionate ones are his power. Therefore one should please beings, as a servant pleases a fierce king.

**Verse 131**
> What could an angered king do that would equal the hell-suffering experienced through making beings unhappy?

**Verse 132**
> What could a pleased king give that would equal buddhahood, experienced through making beings happy?

**Verse 133**
> Setting aside the future buddhahood that arises from pleasing beings—do you not see even here the good fortune, fame, and well-being?

**Verse 134**
> A charming appearance, health, joy, long life, the vast happiness of a cakravartin—the patient one attains all these while wandering in saṃsāra.¹⁵
