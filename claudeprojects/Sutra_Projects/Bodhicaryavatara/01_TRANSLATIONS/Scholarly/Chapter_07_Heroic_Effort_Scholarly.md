# Chapter 7: The Perfection of Heroic Effort

## Vīryapāramitā — वीर्यपारमिता

*A Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel*

---

## I. The Foundation of All Merit

### Verses 1–2: Definition and Adversaries

**Verse 1**
> Thus, having patient forbearance, one should cultivate heroic effort,¹ for awakening is established in effort. Without effort there is no merit—just as without wind there is no movement.

**Verse 2**
> What is heroic effort? Enthusiasm for the wholesome.² Its adversary is called: laziness, attachment to the contemptible, discouragement, and self-deprecation.³

## II. The Nature of Laziness

### Verses 3–15: How Laziness Arises

**Verse 3**
> Through relishing the pleasure of inactivity, through craving for sleep and reliance on it, through lack of distress at the sufferings of saṃsāra—laziness arises.

**Verse 4**
> Caught by the afflictions' huntsmen, you have entered the hunter's net of births. Do you still not know today that you have entered the mouth of death?⁴

**Verse 5**
> Do you not see that those of your own kind are being slaughtered one by one? Yet you go to sleep like a buffalo before the butcher.⁵

**Verse 6**
> When Yama is watching you, when your path is blocked on all sides—how can eating please you? How can sleep? How can pleasure?

**Verse 7**
> When death comes quickly, while your provisions are still being gathered, even if you abandon laziness then—what will you do when it is too late?

**Verse 8**
> "This I have not obtained, this I have begun, this remains half-done—and suddenly death has arrived! Alas, I am slain!"—thinking thus...

**Verse 9**
> ...seeing your relatives in despair, faces tear-stained and red-eyed with the swell of grief, seeing the faces of Yama's messengers...

**Verse 10**
> ...tormented by memories of your own sins, hearing the sounds of the hells, your body smeared with filth from terror—what will you do in your confusion?

**Verse 11**
> "I am like a live fish"—if such fear is appropriate even now, how much more so for one who has done evil, facing the intense sufferings of the hells?

**Verse 12**
> O delicate one, you burn when touched even by hot water. Having done deeds that lead to hell, how do you sit so calmly?

**Verse 13**
> You who want results without effort, delicate one, much-afflicted one, seized by death yet acting as if immortal—O suffering one, you are being destroyed!

**Verse 14**
> Having obtained this human vessel, cross the great river of suffering. O fool, this is not the time for sleep—this boat is difficult to find again!⁶

**Verse 15**
> Abandoning the supreme joy of the Dharma—an unending stream of happiness—how can you take pleasure in frivolity and laughter, which are causes of suffering?

## III. The Causes of Effort

### Verses 16–30: Dispelling Despair

**Verse 16**
> Non-discouragement, the army of strength, application, self-mastery,⁷ equalizing self and other,⁸ and exchanging self and other.

**Verse 17**
> One should not be discouraged thinking "How could awakening be for me?" For the Tathāgata, the truth-speaker, spoke this truth:

**Verse 18**
> "Even gnats, flies, mosquitoes, and worms have attained that supreme awakening so difficult to reach, through the power of their enthusiasm."⁹

**Verse 19**
> How much more so I, born human, able to discern benefit from harm? Not abandoning the way of the Omniscient Ones, why should I not attain awakening?

**Verse 20**
> If I have fear thinking "Hands and feet and such must be given"—that would be my confusion about what is heavy and what is light, from lack of investigation.

**Verse 21**
> For innumerable aeons, countless beyond reckoning, I have been cut, torn, burned, and split—yet awakening did not arise.

**Verse 22**
> But this limited suffering of mine accomplishes complete awakening—like the pain of removing a splinter, for the relief it brings.¹⁰

**Verse 23**
> All physicians produce health through painful procedures. Therefore, to destroy many sufferings, a little must be endured.

**Verse 24**
> But the Supreme Physician has not even given this conventional treatment. He heals the gravely ill through the gentlest of methods.

**Verse 25**
> At first, the Guide prescribes the giving of vegetables and such. Later, gradually, one comes to give even one's own flesh.

**Verse 26**
> When insight arises toward one's own flesh as toward vegetables, then what is difficult about giving up flesh and bone?

**Verse 27**
> One is not unhappy from having abandoned sin; one is not sad from being wise. For suffering comes to the mind from false conception, and to the body from sin.

**Verse 28**
> The body is happy through merit; the mind is happy through wisdom. Dwelling in saṃsāra for the sake of others, why should the compassionate one be afflicted?

**Verse 29**
> Destroying former sins, receiving oceans of merit—through the power of bodhicitta alone, one is swifter than the Śrāvakas.

**Verse 30**
> Thus going from happiness to happiness—who with sense would be discouraged? Having obtained the chariot of bodhicitta, which removes all weariness and toil?

## IV. The Four Powers

### Verses 31–46: Aspiration, Steadfastness, Delight, and Releasing

**Verse 31**
> The powers of aspiration, steadfastness, delight, and releasing¹¹ are for accomplishing the welfare of beings. One should generate aspiration through fear of suffering and by contemplating benefits.

**Verse 32**
> Thus, having uprooted the adversary, one should strive for increase of enthusiasm through the powers of aspiration, pride, delight, releasing, application, and self-mastery.

**Verse 33**
> I must destroy immeasurable faults, my own and others'. But the destruction of each single fault would take oceans of aeons.

**Verse 34**
> If I do not see even the slightest beginning of destroying faults, and I am the vessel for immeasurable suffering—why does my heart not burst?

**Verse 35**
> I must develop many qualities, my own and others'. But the practice of each single quality might not occur even in oceans of aeons.

**Verse 36**
> I have never developed even a fraction of these qualities. Wondrous though it is to have obtained this birth, I have wasted it in vain.

**Verse 37**
> I have not attained the happiness of the great festival of worship of the Blessed One. I have not served the Teaching. I have not fulfilled the hopes of the poor.

**Verse 38**
> I have not given fearlessness to the fearful. I have not made the afflicted happy. I have become only a spike in my mother's womb, destined for suffering.¹²

**Verse 39**
> From the loss of my wish for the Dharma in former lives, now this disaster has arisen for me. Who would relinquish the wish for the Dharma?

**Verse 40**
> The Sage declared that aspiration is the root of all wholesome things. And its root is the constant contemplation of the ripening of results.

## V. The Ripening of Actions

### Verses 41–45: Karma and Its Fruits

**Verse 41**
> Suffering, mental distress, and various fears, and the obstruction of desires—these arise for those who do evil.

**Verse 42**
> Wherever the wish of those who do good goes, there, by those very merits, they are honored with the reward of their results.

**Verse 43**
> But wherever the wish of the evildoer goes, there, by those very sins, they are struck down with the weapons of suffering.

**Verse 44**
> Through virtue, as children of the Sugata, they come before the Sugata—dwelling in the wombs of vast, cool lotuses fragrant and sweet, their radiance increased by nourishment from the Victor's sweet voice, their beautiful bodies emerging from lotuses opened by the sage's rays.

**Verse 45**
> Through evil, crying out in pain as Yama's minions strip all skin, their bodies doused with molten copper heated by fire, their flesh cut into hundreds of pieces by the blows of blazing swords and lances—one falls repeatedly onto the ground of burning iron.

**Verse 46**
> Therefore aspiration for the wholesome should be generated, contemplating this with care. Beginning with the method of Vajradhvaja,¹³ one should cultivate pride.

---

## VI. The Three Kinds of Self-Confidence

### Verses 47–59: Pride of Work, Pride of Capacity, Pride of Afflictions

**Verse 47**
> First examining one's capacity, one should undertake or not undertake. Not undertaking is better than undertaking only to turn back.

**Verse 48**
> In another life too, this habit continues; sin and suffering increase. And another task and its time are lost—and even that task is not accomplished.

**Verse 49**
> Self-confidence should be applied to three things: action, defilements, and capacity.¹⁴ "I alone must do this"—this is the self-confidence regarding action.

**Verse 50**
> This world, under the power of afflictions, is unable to accomplish its own welfare. Therefore I must do it for them, for I am not incapable like ordinary people.

**Verse 51**
> When another is doing lowly work, should I just stand by? If I do not do it out of pride, better that my pride perish.

**Verse 52**
> Even a crow acts like a Garuḍa when it finds a dead snake.¹⁵ If my mind is weak, even a small onslaught will harm me.

**Verse 53**
> When one stops trying, given to discouragement, misfortunes easily prevail. But one who rises up and strives is hard to conquer even by the great.

**Verse 54**
> Therefore, with a firm mind, I shall overcome misfortune through misfortune.¹⁶ For one who wishes to conquer the three worlds, defeat by me is laughable.

**Verse 55**
> I must conquer all; I shall be conquered by none. I shall bear this pride, for I am the offspring of the Lion of Victors.¹⁷

**Verse 56**
> Those beings conquered by pride are wretched—they are not proud. The proud one does not come under the power of the enemy; but those are under the power of the enemy pride.

**Verse 57**
> Led by pride to the lower realms, even as humans they have lost all joy—eating others' leavings, as slaves, foolish, ugly, and emaciated.

**Verse 58**
> Everywhere despised, those ascetics stiff with pride—if they too are counted among the proud, then tell me, what is pitiable?

**Verse 59**
> Those are the proud and victorious, those are the heroes, who bear pride for the sake of conquering the enemy pride—who, having slain that quivering enemy pride, freely grant the fruit of victory to beings.¹⁸

## VII. Application and Joy

### Verses 60–75: Delight in Work

**Verse 60**
> Stationed amid the host of afflictions, one should be defiant a thousandfold—unconquerable by the hosts of afflictions, like a lion among herds of deer.

**Verse 61**
> Even in great difficulties, the eye does not see taste. So too, even when meeting difficulty, one should not come under the power of afflictions.

**Verse 62**
> One should be addicted to whatever task one is undertaking, intoxicated by that task, insatiable—like one who wants the fruit-pleasure of play.

**Verse 63**
> Work is done for the sake of happiness, yet whether happiness comes or not is uncertain. But for one whose happiness is in the work itself—how can one be happy without work?¹⁹

**Verse 64**
> In saṃsāra there is no satisfaction in sensual pleasures, which are like honey on a razor's edge. How could there be satisfaction in the nectar of merit, whose ripening is sweet and blissful?

**Verse 65**
> Therefore, even at the end of a task, one should plunge into another task, just as an elephant scorched by the midday sun, upon finding a lake, plunges in.

**Verse 66**
> But when strength declines, one should release to continue later. When well completed, one should release with thirst for what comes next.

**Verse 67**
> One should guard against the blows of the afflictions and strike firmly at the afflictions—like one engaged in sword-battle with a trained enemy.

**Verse 68**
> Just as one would quickly and fearfully seize a dropped sword, so should one seize the dropped sword of mindfulness, remembering the hells.

**Verse 69**
> Just as poison reaching the blood spreads through the body, so when a fault finds an opening, it spreads through the mind.

**Verse 70**
> Like an oil-bearer watched by sword-bearers, who in fear of death if he stumbles is completely focused on the oil—so too should the practitioner be focused.

**Verse 71**
> Therefore, just as one quickly rises when a snake comes into one's lap, so when the approach of sleep and laziness comes, one should quickly counter them.

**Verse 72**
> At each misstep, one should be thoroughly remorseful and reflect: "How shall I act so that this does not happen to me again?"

**Verse 73**
> One should seek association or activity for this reason, thinking: "How may the practice of mindfulness come about in these circumstances?"

**Verse 74**
> One should make oneself light, remembering the instruction on heedfulness,²⁰ so that before the approach of action, one is ready for everything.

**Verse 75**
> Just as cotton goes wherever the wind takes it, coming or going—so one should go where enthusiasm takes one, and thus success is achieved.²¹
