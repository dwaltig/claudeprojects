# Chapter 8: The Perfection of Meditation

## I. The Foundation of Meditation

### Verses 1–4: Why Solitude Is Needed

**Verse 1**
> Having thus increased effort, one should establish the mind in meditation. For a person with a distracted mind dwells between the fangs of afflictions.¹

**Verse 2**
> Through the seclusion of body and mind, distraction does not arise. Therefore, abandoning the world, one should abandon discursive thoughts.

**Verse 3**
> Through attachment the world is not abandoned, and through craving for gain and such. Therefore, to abandon these, the wise one should reflect thus:

**Verse 4**
> Knowing that through tranquility well-endowed with insight the afflictions are destroyed, tranquility should be sought first. And that arises through being free from concern about the world, through delight in detachment.²

## II. Abandoning Worldly Attachments

### Verses 5–15: The Problem with Others

**Verse 5**
> Who among impermanent beings should have affection for impermanent things? For thousands of births one will not see the beloved again.

**Verse 6**
> Without seeing, one does not attain joy, and does not remain in concentration. Even seeing, one is not satisfied—as before, one is afflicted by craving.

**Verse 7**
> One does not see things as they are; one falls from disenchantment. One is burned by that grief, by the desire to meet the beloved.

**Verse 8**
> By thinking of that, one's short life goes by in vain, again and again. By a transient friend, the eternal Dharma is ruined.

**Verse 9**
> Behaving in common with fools, one surely goes to lower rebirths. And being led to what is unwholesome—what is gained from the company of fools?

**Verse 10**
> In an instant they become friends; in an instant they become enemies. They become angry at what ought to please. Ordinary people are difficult to satisfy.

**Verse 11**
> When told something beneficial, they become angry and prevent me from the beneficial. If they are not listened to, they become angry and go to lower rebirths.

**Verse 12**
> Jealous of the superior, competitive with equals, arrogant toward the inferior, puffed up by praise, angry at criticism—when is there benefit from the fool?

**Verse 13**
> From fool to fool there inevitably arises some unwholesomeness: self-praise, disparagement of others, conversation about the pleasures of saṃsāra.

**Verse 14**
> Thus from that association with that one comes a meeting with misfortune. I shall dwell alone, happy, with an unafflicted mind.

**Verse 15**
> One should flee far from the fool; having met them, one should please them with kind words—not through the intimacy of familiarity, but being indifferent, like a virtuous person.³

## III. The Joy of Solitude

### Verses 16–39: Dwelling in the Forest

**Verse 16**
> Taking only dharma-essence, like a bee taking honey from flowers, I shall dwell everywhere unknown, as if new.

**Verse 17**
> "I am a gainer, I am honored, many want me"—such pride of the mortal leads to fear at the approach of death.

**Verse 18**
> Wherever the mind deluded by pleasure goes, there that pleasure-multiplied-a-thousandfold-into-suffering stands before it.

**Verse 19**
> Therefore the wise one should not desire that. From desire fear arises. This passes by itself—having made firmness, one should wait.

**Verse 20**
> Many gained wealth, many gained fame—but where did they go, together with their wealth and fame? No one knows.

**Verse 21**
> Others despise me—why should I rejoice when praised? Others praise me—why should I be sad when criticized?

**Verse 22**
> Beings of various inclinations are not satisfied even by the Jinas. How much less by an ignorant person like me! So why think about worldly people?

**Verse 23**
> They revile one without gain; they disparage one with gain. When those are painful to associate with by nature, how can delight arise from them?

**Verse 24**
> "The fool is no one's friend"—so the Tathāgatas have said. For the fool's affection arises only from self-interest.

**Verse 25**
> What affection arises through self-interest is affection for self-interest. Just as there is agitation when property is lost—that is from the loss of happiness it brought.

**Verse 26**
> Trees do not blame, and they need not be pleased with effort. When might I dwell together with those happy companions?

**Verse 27**
> Dwelling in an empty temple, at the foot of a tree, or in caves—when shall I go without looking back, without concern?

**Verse 28**
> Dwelling in places naturally vast and unclaimed, freely wandering—when shall I dwell unattached?

**Verse 29**
> With just an earthen bowl for wealth, with robes unattractive to thieves—when shall I dwell fearless, not guarding the body?

**Verse 30**
> Going to my own charnel ground, when shall I compare my own body with other skeletons—subject to decay as it is?

**Verse 31**
> For this body of mine will become so putrid that even jackals will not approach it because of the smell.

**Verse 32**
> The bone-pieces arising together with this single body will become separate. How much more so other beloved people.

**Verse 33**
> Alone one is born; alone one dies. This share of suffering cannot be taken by another. What use are obstructing loved ones?

**Verse 34**
> Just as one on a journey takes up a dwelling-place, so one journeying through existence takes up the dwelling-place of a birth.

**Verse 35**
> Until this body is carried out by four people, while the world still grieves—just so long should one go to the forest.

**Verse 36**
> Without intimacy and hostility, this body is already dead to the world. When dying, one does not grieve.

**Verse 37**
> And no one near causes distress by grieving. And no one disturbs the recollection of the Buddha and such.

**Verse 38**
> Therefore solitude is delightful, free from distress, source of well-being, calming all distractions—always to be cultivated by me.

**Verse 39**
> Released from all other thoughts, with a mind single-pointedly focused on my own mind, I shall strive for concentration and for taming the mind.⁴

## IV. Contempt for Sensual Pleasure

### Verses 40–85: The Foulness Contemplation

**Verse 40**
> For sensual pleasures produce misfortune, in this world and the next: here through bondage, killing, and cutting; hereafter through hell and such.

*[Verses 41–84 continue the extensive foulness contemplation (aśubha-bhāvanā), examining the impurity of the body and the delusion of attraction. Key themes include:]*

- **Verses 44–56**: The body is like a machine of impurities—bones bound by sinews, covered with flesh and skin
- **Verses 57–68**: The beloved object of desire is merely filth adorned
- **Verses 69–78**: Sensual attachment leads to immense suffering, slavery, and violence
- **Verses 79–84**: Even a fraction of the effort spent on sense pleasures would achieve awakening

**Verse 85**
> Thus recoiling from sensual pleasures, one should generate delight in solitude, in peaceful forest lands empty of conflict and strife.

---

## V. The Delight of the Forest

### Verses 86–89: Blissful Seclusion

**Verse 86**
> Happy ones walk on broad rock terraces of palaces pleasant with moonbeam-sandalwood coolness, fanned by the silent, gentle forest breeze—contemplating for the benefit of others.⁵

**Verse 87**
> Dwelling for as long as desired in empty places, at the foot of a tree, in caves—freed from the weariness of guarding possessions—one wanders as one wishes, without concern.

**Verse 88**
> Dwelling where one wishes, free, attached to no one—one enjoys such happiness of contentment as even Indra would find difficult to obtain.

**Verse 89**
> Thus, through such aspects, cultivating the virtues of solitude, with discursive thoughts calmed, one should cultivate bodhicitta.

## VI. Equality of Self and Other

### Verses 90–119: Parātmasamatā

**Verse 90**
> First, one should thus carefully cultivate the equality of self and other: all are equal in suffering and happiness—they should be protected by me as if they were myself.⁶

**Verse 91**
> Just as the body, with its many parts such as hands, is to be protected as a single thing—so too this world, though differentiated, is the same in suffering and happiness.

**Verse 92**
> Even though my suffering does not affect other bodies, it is still suffering that is unbearable to me because of attachment to self.

**Verse 93**
> So too, even though another's suffering is not experienced by me in myself, it is still suffering unbearable to him because of attachment to self.

**Verse 94**
> Another's suffering is to be removed by me, for it is suffering, like my own suffering. Others are to be benefited by me, for they are sentient beings, like my own being.

**Verse 95**
> When happiness is equally dear to me and to others, what is special about me that I strive for happiness for myself alone?

**Verse 96**
> When fear and suffering are equally unwanted by me and by others, what is special about me that I protect myself and not others?

**Verse 97**
> If I do not protect them because their suffering does not harm me—the suffering of the future body does not harm me either. Why then is that protected?

**Verse 98**
> "I shall be that very one then"—this conception is false. For it is one who dies and entirely another who is born.

**Verse 99**
> If whatever suffering someone has is to be protected by that very one, foot-suffering is not the hand's—why then is that protected by it?

**Verse 100**
> If this is inappropriate but proceeds from grasping an "I"—what is inappropriate for oneself and for another is to be abandoned as far as possible.

**Verse 101**
> A continuum and a group are false, like a row and an army. There is no one whose suffering it is. Therefore, whose is it to be called "one's own"?

**Verse 102**
> All sufferings equally are without owner. They are to be warded off simply because they are suffering. What use is a restriction here?

**Verse 103**
> Why should suffering be warded off? Because it is agreed by all without dispute. If it is to be warded off, then all of it equally. If not, then for me as for another.⁷

## VII. Exchanging Self and Other

### Verses 120–154: Parātmaparivartana

**Verse 120**
> One who wishes to quickly rescue self and other should practice that supreme secret: the exchange of self and other.⁸

**Verse 121**
> Because of excessive love for the self, there is fear even from a small danger. Who would not hate that self like an enemy, which causes fear?

**Verse 122**
> One who, thinking to cure illness such as hunger and thirst, kills birds, fish, and deer, and lies in wait on the road—

**Verse 123**
> —one who for the sake of gain and honor would kill even parents, would steal the Three Jewels' property, and would become fuel for Avīci—

**Verse 124**
> —what wise person would desire, protect, or honor that self? Who would not see it as an enemy? Who would respect it?

*[Verses 125–154 continue the exchange practice, including:]*

- **Verses 129–133**: All suffering arises from desiring one's own happiness; all happiness from desiring others' happiness
- **Verses 134–139**: The self must be given to others; others must be taken as self
- **Verses 140–154**: Detailed meditation on viewing oneself from another's perspective, applying jealousy, envy, and contempt to the self

## VIII. Conclusion: Mastering the Mind

### Verses 155–186: The Final Taming

**Verse 155**
> Countless aeons have passed while you sought your own welfare. By that great effort you have gained only suffering.

**Verse 156**
> By my instruction, engage thus without hesitation. Later you will see its benefits, for the Sage's word is true.

*[Verses 157–172 address the self directly, commanding it to serve others]*

**Verse 173**
> If you have affection for the self, do not take pleasure in the self. If the self is to be protected, this one should not be protected.

**Verse 174**
> The more this body is protected, the more delicate it becomes, and just so the more it falls.

**Verse 175**
> When it has thus fallen, even the whole earth is unable to fulfill its wishes. Then who will fulfill its wish?

**Verse 176**
> For one who wishes what cannot be had, affliction and disappointed hope arise. For one who is without hope in all things, prosperity never decays.

**Verse 177**
> Therefore, no scope should be given for the body's wish-increase. That is the good thing: what is not grasped as desirable is not taken.

**Verse 178**
> This ending in ashes, inert, moved by another—this horrible impure image—why do I grasp it?

**Verse 179**
> What use to me is this machine, living or dead? How is it different from a clod of dirt? Alas, why does my "I"-grasping not perish?

**Verse 184**
> Therefore I have given up this body for the welfare of the world. Though it has many faults, it is maintained as an instrument of action.

**Verse 185**
> So, enough of worldly conduct! Following the wise, remembering the instruction on heedfulness, I shall ward off drowsiness and dullness.

**Verse 186**
> Therefore, to destroy the obscurations, I shall practice concentration, drawing the mind back from wrong paths, constantly on its own support.⁹
