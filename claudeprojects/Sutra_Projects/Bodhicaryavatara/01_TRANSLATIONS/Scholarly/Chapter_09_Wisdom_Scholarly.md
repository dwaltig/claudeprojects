## I. The Purpose of Wisdom

### Verses 1–10: Why Wisdom Is Needed

**Verse 1**
> All this preparation the Sage declared for the sake of wisdom.¹ Therefore, one who wishes to end suffering should generate wisdom.

**Verse 2**
> Two truths are held to exist: conventional and ultimate.² Reality is beyond the scope of intellect. Intellect is called conventional.

**Verse 3**
> With respect to this, the world is seen as twofold: the yogin and the ordinary. With respect to this, the ordinary world is refuted by the world of yogins.

**Verse 4**
> And yogins are refuted by successively higher ones, through distinctions of intelligence—for the purpose of an outcome accepted by both, without analysis.

**Verse 5**
> By the world, things are seen and conceived as real—not as illusion-like. Here there is disagreement between yogins and the world.

**Verse 6**
> Even direct perception of form and such is by convention, not by valid cognition—that convention is false, like the convention of purity regarding impure things.

**Verse 7**
> And for the purpose of leading the world, things are taught by the Protector. In reality they are momentary—if this contradicts convention, so be it.

**Verse 8**
> There is no fault for the yogin by way of convention. For truth-seers see differently from the world. Otherwise there would be worldly refutation of the perception of women as impure.³

## II. Refuting the Truly Existent Self

### Verses 56–78: Analysis of the Self

**Verse 57**
> If there is fear from that thing which produces suffering, let there be fear! Emptiness is the calmer of suffering—from that why should fear arise?

**Verse 58**
> If there is any self, let there be fear from that! But I am not anything at all. If "I" am nothing, fear of whom will there be?

**Verse 59**
> I am not teeth, hair, or nails. I am not bones, nor am I blood. I am not mucus, nor phlegm, nor pus, nor lymph.

**Verse 60**
> I am not fat, nor sweat, nor marrow, nor entrails. I am not the visceral cavity. I am not feces and urine.

**Verse 61**
> I am not flesh, nor sinews. I am not warmth nor wind. I am not the orifices, nor am I the six consciousnesses in any way.

*[Verses 62–75 continue the analysis of consciousness, refuting Sāṃkhya and other views]*

**Verse 76**
> "If there is no being, toward whom is compassion?" Toward that which is projected for the purpose of outcomes, through the delusion assumed.

**Verse 77**
> "Whose is the outcome if there is no being?" True, the effort is from delusion. But for the cessation of suffering, the delusion of the outcome is not prevented.

**Verse 78**
> But the delusion of the self, the cause of suffering, increases from the delusion of an "I." If that too is not to be stopped, better is the meditation on selflessness.

## III. Analysis of the Body

### Verses 79–88: The Body Is Empty

**Verse 79**
> The body is not the feet, nor the calves. The body is not the thighs, nor the hip. The body is not the belly, nor is it the back. The body is not the chest, nor the arms.

**Verse 80**
> It is not the hands, nor the sides, nor the armpits, nor characterized by the shoulders. It is not the neck, nor the head. Then what is the body here?

**Verse 84**
> Therefore there is no body. But from delusion there is the idea of a body in the hands and such, due to a particular arrangement—like the idea of a person in a post.⁴

**Verse 88**
> Thus, when form is like a dream, who is attached upon investigation? And when the body does not exist thus, then who is a woman and who is a man?

## IV. Analysis of Suffering and Mind

### Verses 89–104: Nothing Has True Existence

**Verse 89**
> If suffering truly exists, why does it not afflict the happy? If delicacies are truly pleasant suffering, why are they not enjoyed by the grief-stricken?

**Verse 99**
> When there is no experiencer at all and feeling also does not exist, then, having seen this situation, O craving, why are you not destroyed?

**Verse 102**
> There is no experiencer at all. Therefore feeling does not exist in reality. In this selfless aggregate, who exactly is afflicted by it?

**Verse 103**
> The mind is not located in the sense organs, not in form and such, not in between. And the mind is not found within or without, nor is it found elsewhere.

**Verse 104**
> That which is not in the body nor elsewhere, not mixed nor separate anywhere—that is nothing at all. Therefore beings are by nature beyond sorrow.⁵

## V. Refutation of Philosophical Views

### Verses 117–150: Against Theism, Sāṃkhya, and Reificationism

**Verse 119**
> "Īśvara is the cause of the world." Tell me, what really is Īśvara? If you say "the elements"—let it be so! But why the trouble over a mere name?

**Verse 120**
> Moreover, the elements are many, impermanent, without consciousness, not divine, to be stepped over, impure—earth and so on are not Īśvara.

**Verse 121**
> Space is not the lord, as it is inactive. Not the self, because that was refuted before. And if the creatorship of the unthinkable is also unthinkable, what is there to say about it?

**Verse 143**
> What is made by illusion and what is made by causes—investigate where it comes from and where it goes.

**Verse 144**
> What is seen in the presence of something else and not in its absence—like a reflection, how can it be real when it is artificial?

**Verse 150**
> Thus there is no cessation and no arising. Therefore all this world is unborn and unceased.

**Verse 151**
> The movements of saṃsāra are like a dream. Upon investigation, they are like a plantain tree.⁶ In reality there is no distinction between those passed beyond sorrow and those not.

## VI. Conclusion: The Aspiration of Compassion

### Verses 152–168: Question and Resolve

**Verse 152**
> With all phenomena thus empty, what is gained and what is lost? By whom will respect or contempt be received?

**Verse 153**
> Whence is happiness or suffering? What is liked or disliked? That craving—when sought in its nature, what is that craving?

**Verse 154**
> Upon investigation, what world of the living exists? Who will die here? What will become? What was? Who is a relative? Who is a friend?

**Verse 155**
> May those like me understand: all is like space! They become angry, they rejoice, through causes of conflict and celebration.

**Verse 163**
> Moreover, moments are difficult to find, the arising of a Buddha is extremely rare, and the flood of afflictions is hard to restrain. Alas, the succession of sufferings!

**Verse 164**
> Alas, those extremely pitiable ones, dwelling in the flood of suffering, who do not see their own distress, even though so extremely distressed!

**Verse 167**
> When shall I bring peace to those tormented by the fire of suffering, through my own resources of happiness arising from clouds of merit?

**Verse 168**
> When shall I teach emptiness to those with views of grasping, while carefully accumulating the collection of merit with conventionalities of non-apprehension?⁷

³ The perception of the body as impure is valid for yogins, though ordinary people don't see it.

⁴ Like mistaking a post for a person in darkness—the "body" is conceptual imputation.

⁵ *Prakṛtyā parinirvṛtāḥ*: "By nature beyond sorrow"—the radical conclusion.

⁶ The plantain tree has no core—*kadalīstambha*.

⁷ Balancing emptiness with conventional merit-accumulation.
