# Chapter 4: Heedfulness Regarding Bodhicitta

## Bodhicittāpramādaḥ — बोधिचित्ताप्रमादः

*A Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel*

---

## I. The Obligation of the Vow

### Verses 1–6: Keeping the Commitment

**Verse 1**
> Having thus firmly taken hold of bodhicitta, a child of the Victors should always make effort, without laziness, not to transgress the trainings.¹

**Verse 2**
> Whatever is undertaken hastily, whatever is not properly considered—regarding these it is fitting to say "I may or may not do this."² Even after making a promise, this is appropriate.

**Verse 3**
> But that which has been examined by the Buddhas and their offspring of great wisdom,³ and by me too according to my ability—in that matter, why should I delay?

**Verse 4**
> If, having promised thus, I do not accomplish it through action, then having deceived all these beings, what destiny will be mine?⁴

**Verse 5**
> It is said that one who, even after merely thinking of giving, does not give, becomes a hungry ghost—even over a trifling thing.⁵

**Verse 6**
> How much more so one who, having sincerely proclaimed supreme happiness with a loud voice, deceives the entire world—what destiny will be mine?

## II. The Power of Bodhicitta to Liberate

### Verses 7–11: Cosmic Consequences

**Verse 7**
> The Omniscient One alone knows this inconceivable course of karma: that even one who abandons bodhicitta, he liberates such a one.⁶

**Verse 8**
> Therefore, for a bodhisattva, every downfall is exceedingly serious, for when he falls, he causes harm to the welfare of all beings.

**Verse 9**
> And whoever else creates, even for a moment, an obstacle to his merit—there is no end to that one's lower rebirths, since he has destroyed the welfare of beings.⁷

**Verse 10**
> If one would be destroyed by destroying the welfare of even a single being, how much more by destroying the welfare of embodied beings throughout the expanse of space?

**Verse 11**
> Thus, oscillating in saṃsāra through the force of downfalls and the force of bodhicitta, one is long delayed in attaining the stages.⁸

## III. Urgency and the Precious Human Life

### Verses 12–23: Now or Never

**Verse 12**
> Therefore, what I have vowed must be accomplished by me with diligence. If effort is not made today, I have gone from depth to depth.⁹

**Verse 13**
> Immeasurable Buddhas have passed, seekers of all beings, but through my own faults I did not come into the range of their healing.¹⁰

**Verse 14**
> And if today I remain just as before, I shall again and again obtain lower rebirths, disease, death, cutting, splitting, and the rest.

**Verse 15**
> When shall I obtain—so exceedingly difficult to obtain—the arising of a Tathāgata, faith, human existence, and fitness for cultivating virtue?¹¹

**Verse 16**
> This day of health, with food, without calamity—life is a fleeting moment, deceptive. The body is like something borrowed.¹²

**Verse 17**
> Through such conduct of mine, human existence is not obtained again. When human existence is not obtained, there is only evil—whence virtue?

**Verse 18**
> If I do not perform virtue even when fit for virtue, what shall I do when bewildered by the sufferings of the lower realms?

**Verse 19**
> When one does not perform virtue and only accumulates evil, the very word "higher rebirth" is destroyed for hundreds of millions of aeons.

**Verse 20**
> Therefore the Blessed One said that human life is exceedingly difficult to obtain—like a turtle putting its neck through the hole of a yoke floating on the great ocean.¹³

**Verse 21**
> For evil committed in a single moment one dwells in Avīci for an aeon.¹⁴ What talk then of higher rebirth when evil has been accumulated since beginningless time?

**Verse 22**
> And having experienced just that, one is not freed. For while experiencing that, one gives birth to further evil.¹⁵

**Verse 23**
> There is no greater deception than this, there is no greater delusion than this: that having obtained such a moment, I have not practiced virtue.

## IV. The Fire of Regret

### Verses 24–27: Torment to Come

**Verse 24**
> If I reflect thus and yet fall again into confusion, I shall lament for a long time, tormented by the messengers of Yama.

**Verse 25**
> For a long time the unbearable fire of hell will burn my body. For a long time the fire of remorse will burn my untrained mind.

**Verse 26**
> Somehow I have reached this beneficial ground, so difficult to reach, yet knowingly I am being led again to those same hells.¹⁶

**Verse 27**
> Here I have no will of my own—I am as if bewildered by spells. I do not know by what I am confused. Who is it that dwells within me?¹⁷

## V. The Inner Enemies

### Verses 28–35: Afflictions as Foes

**Verse 28**
> The enemies that are craving, aversion, and the rest have no hands, no feet. They are not brave, they are not wise. How have I been made a slave by them?¹⁸

**Verse 29**
> Stationed in my very mind, they strike at me at their ease. Yet even at that I do not become angry—shame on my misplaced patience!

**Verse 30**
> If all the gods and all humans were my enemies, even they could not lead me to the fire of Avīci.¹⁹

**Verse 31**
> These powerful enemies, the afflictions, throw me there in an instant—where, if even Mount Meru met it, not even ashes would be found.

**Verse 32**
> The lifespan of no other enemy is as long as this—beginningless and endless, as long as the great duration of my affliction-enemies.²⁰

**Verse 33**
> All others, if served agreeably, work for my benefit. But these afflictions, when served, only cause me more suffering.²¹

**Verse 34**
> Thus, while constant, long-lasting enemies—sole causes of flooding torrents of misfortune—dwell in my heart, how can I dwell fearlessly enjoying saṃsāra with delight?

**Verse 35**
> These are the jailers of the prison of existence, the executioners even in the hells. If they dwell in the cage of craving within my mental home, how can there be happiness for me?

## VI. The Warrior's Resolve

### Verses 36–42: Declaration of War

**Verse 36**
> Therefore I shall not lay down this burden until these enemies are slain before my eyes. Even regarding a minor offender, the proud, bound in anger, do not sleep until they have struck him down.²²

**Verse 37**
> On the battlefield, striving fiercely to strike down natural enemies who are subject to the suffering of mortality anyway, men do not turn back, ignoring the pain of arrows and spears.²³

**Verse 38**
> How much less should I be subject to depression and despair now, being engaged in striking down the natural enemies that are the constant causes of all suffering, even by hundreds of misfortunes?

**Verse 39**
> People display upon their bodies the wounds inflicted by enemies without reason, like ornaments. Why then should sufferings hinder me, engaged in accomplishing a great goal?²⁴

**Verse 40**
> Fishermen, outcasts, farmers, and the like, their minds fixed on merely their own livelihood, endure hardships of cold, heat, and so forth. Why do I not endure for the sake of the world's welfare?²⁵

**Verse 41**
> Having vowed to liberate beings throughout space extending to the ten directions from afflictions, I have not even freed myself from afflictions.

**Verse 42**
> Speaking like that without knowing my own measure, was I not a madman then? Therefore I shall never turn back from destroying afflictions.²⁶

## VII. Commitment to Victory

### Verses 43–48: Unswerving Resolve

**Verse 43**
> In this I shall be grasping, bound in enmity, a combatant—except for that affliction that is connected with destroying afflictions.²⁷

**Verse 44**
> Let my entrails spill out if they will, let my head fall—but I shall never bow down before the enemies that are the afflictions.²⁸

**Verse 45**
> An exiled enemy may find a foothold in another land, from where, having regained his strength, he returns. But the course of the affliction-enemy is not like this.²⁹

**Verse 46**
> Expelled from my mind, where would he go? Where would he stay while contriving to destroy me? I simply lack effort—wretched are the afflictions, they are conquered through the eye of wisdom.³⁰

**Verse 47**
> Afflictions do not dwell in sense objects, nor in the sense faculties, nor in between, nor elsewhere. Where then do they dwell, these that torment the whole world? This is mere illusion. Therefore, release your heart from fear, cultivate effort for wisdom.³¹ Why do you needlessly afflict yourself in the hells?

**Verse 48**
> Having determined thus, I make effort for the accomplishment of the trainings as taught. How can one whose illness is curable by a physician's instructions become healthy if he strays from them?³²

# Scholarly Apparatus

## Footnotes

¹ **[Sanskrit]** *śikṣā*: The trainings or precepts of the bodhisattva path. *Atikrama*: transgression.

² **[Philosophical]** Śāntideva distinguishes between impulsive promises (which may be reconsidered) and the bodhisattva vow (which has been carefully examined).

³ **[Sanskrit]** *mahāprājña*: Those of great wisdom—the bodhisattvas.

⁴ **[Sanskrit]** *visaṃvādya*: Having deceived or lied to.

⁵ **[Cross-reference]** The doctrine that unfulfilled mental intentions to give can lead to rebirth as a hungry ghost (*preta*) appears in various Abhidharma texts.

⁶ **[Philosophical]** Even though abandoning bodhicitta is a grave fault, the Omniscient One eventually liberates even those who fall. This shows both the seriousness of the vow and the ultimate compassion of the path.

⁷ **[Sanskrit]** *sattvārtha-ghātin*: Destroyer of the welfare of beings—the gravest charge.

⁸ **[Sanskrit]** *bhūmi-prāpti*: Attainment of the stages (*bhūmi*) of the bodhisattva path.

⁹ **[Sanskrit]** *talena talam*: From depth to depth—a vivid image of descending through lower realms.

¹⁰ **[Sanskrit]** *cikitsā-gocara*: The range or scope of healing—the Buddha as physician.

¹¹ **[Sanskrit]** *kuśalābhyāsa-yogyatva*: Fitness for practicing virtue—a defining feature of the precious human birth.

¹² **[Sanskrit]** *upācita-kopa*: Something borrowed or on loan. Life is not our permanent possession.

¹³ **[Cross-reference]** The blind turtle simile appears in the *Saṃyutta Nikāya* and many Mahāyāna texts. A blind turtle surfaces once every hundred years; a yoke with a hole floats on the ocean. The chance of the turtle's neck entering the hole represents the rarity of human birth.

¹⁴ **[Sanskrit]** *avīci*: The lowest and most terrible of the hot hells.

¹⁵ **[Philosophical]** The vicious cycle: suffering in hell does not purify us; instead, suffering beings generate more negative karma through anger, despair, and hatred.

¹⁶ **[Sanskrit]** *hitabhūmi*: Beneficial ground—the precious human birth with all its opportunities.

¹⁷ **[Philosophical]** The bewilderment described here is the key insight: we are controlled by something we do not understand.

¹⁸ **[Sanskrit]** *dāsī-kṛta*: Made into a slave or servant. The afflictions (*kleśa*) are portrayed as pathetic enemies who have nonetheless conquered us.

¹⁹ **[Sanskrit]** *avīcikaṃ vahni*: The fire of Avīci hell.

²⁰ **[Philosophical]** The afflictions' lifespan is *anādi-anta*—beginningless and endless—unless actively countered.

²¹ **[Philosophical]** The contrast: ordinary enemies can be friends if treated well; afflictions, when indulged, only grow stronger.

²² **[Philosophical]** Śāntideva invokes worldly honor culture to shame himself into spiritual effort.

²³ **[Sanskrit]** *raṇa-śiras*: The head of battle, the front line.

²⁴ **[Philosophical]** Warriors display scars as badges of honor; the bodhisattva should view spiritual struggles similarly.

²⁵ **[Sanskrit]** *kaivarta-caṇḍāla-kṛṣīvala*: Fishermen, outcasts, farmers—those of low social status who nonetheless endure hardship for mere livelihood.

²⁶ **[Sanskrit]** *unmataka*: Madman. Śāntideva calls himself insane for the gap between his vow and his practice.

²⁷ **[Philosophical]** A paradox: the only affliction permitted is the "affliction" of destroying afflictions.

²⁸ **[Sanskrit]** *avanati*: Bowing down, submission. This verse has become famous for its fierce resolve.

²⁹ **[Philosophical]** The image of an exiled enemy regrouping elsewhere; afflictions, once truly uprooted, have nowhere to go.

³⁰ **[Sanskrit]** *prajñā-dṛṣṭi-sādhya*: Conquered through the eye of wisdom—insight dissolves afflictions.

³¹ **[Philosophical]** This crucial verse establishes that afflictions have no ultimate location or substance—they are *māyā* (illusion). This is key Mādhyamaka doctrine.

³² **[Cross-reference]** The physician metaphor again: the Buddha's teachings are medicine; we must follow the prescription.

## Key Concepts

- **Apramāda** (अप्रमाद): Non-heedlessness, vigilance, conscientious effort. The opposite of spiritual laziness.

- **Kleśa** (क्लेश): Afflictions, mental disturbances—craving, aversion, delusion, and their derivatives. The "inner enemies."

- **Avīci** (अवीचि): The lowest hell, realm of uninterrupted suffering.

- **Prajñā-dṛṣṭi** (प्रज्ञादृष्टि): The eye of wisdom that sees through the illusion of afflictions.

---

## Metrical Notes

- **Verses 1–35**: *Anuṣṭubh* meter (8 syllables per quarter)
- **Verses 36–48**: Various longer meters (*vaṃśastha*, *vasantatilakā*) for dramatic emphasis

The shift to longer meters in the latter half marks the chapter's escalation into warrior rhetoric.
