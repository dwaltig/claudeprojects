## I. The Centrality of Mind

### Verses 1–18: Mind as the Root of All

**Verse 1**
> One who wishes to guard the training must diligently guard the mind.¹ It is impossible to guard the training if one does not guard the wandering mind.

**Verse 2**
> Uncontrolled, maddened elephants do not cause as much harm in this world as is caused by the mind-elephant let loose in Avīci and elsewhere.²

**Verse 3**
> If the mind-elephant is bound on all sides by the rope of mindfulness, all fear disappears and all good comes near.³

**Verse 4–5**
> Tigers, lions, elephants, bears, serpents, all enemies, all the guardians of hell, ḍākinīs, and rākṣasas⁴—all these become bound by binding the one mind alone. By taming the one mind alone, all are tamed.

**Verse 6**
> For the Teacher of Truth has said that all fears and immeasurable sufferings arise from the mind itself.⁵

**Verse 7**
> By whom were the weapons of hell forged with such effort? By whom was the floor of heated iron made? Whence came those women?⁶

**Verse 8**
> The Sage declared that all such things arise from the sinful mind. Therefore there is nothing more terrifying in the three worlds than the mind.

**Verse 9**
> If the perfection of generosity consisted of making the world free from poverty, then since the world is still poor, how did the former Protectors perfect it?⁷

**Verse 10**
> The perfection of generosity is said to be the mind of giving away all things to all beings, together with the fruit of that. Therefore, it is the mind itself.⁸

**Verse 11**
> Where can fish and the like be led so that I will not kill them? When the mind of renunciation is obtained, that is considered the perfection of ethics.⁹

**Verse 12**
> How many wicked people, limitless as the sky, can I kill? When the mind of anger is killed, all enemies are killed.¹⁰

**Verse 13**
> Where would there be leather to cover the entire earth? The earth is covered with leather merely by the leather of my sandals.¹¹

**Verse 14**
> Similarly, I am unable to restrain external things. I shall restrain my own mind. What is the use of restraining other things?

**Verse 15**
> Even accompanied by speech and body, a mind of weak application does not produce results like those of the sharp mind alone—even to the state of Brahmā.¹²

**Verse 16**
> The Omniscient One said that all recitations and austerities, though performed for a long time, are simply pointless if the mind is directed elsewhere, distracted.¹³

**Verse 17**
> Those who have not cultivated this mind—the secret essence of all Dharma—wander pointlessly in space, seeking to destroy suffering and attain happiness.

**Verse 18**
> Therefore I must keep my mind well-placed and well-guarded. Apart from the vow of guarding the mind, what use are many vows to me?¹⁴

## II. Mindfulness and Introspection

### Verses 19–33: The Foundation of Practice

**Verse 19**
> Just as one in the midst of an unruly crowd carefully protects a wound, so one in the midst of bad company should always protect the wound of the mind.¹⁵

**Verse 20**
> Fearing a little pain from a wound, I protect the wound carefully. Fearing the crushing of the Hell-Mountains, why do I not protect the wound of the mind?

**Verse 21**
> Living in this way, even among wicked people, even among attractive people, the steadfast practitioner is not shattered.¹⁶

**Verse 22**
> Let gains, honor, and physical life be lost—let other virtues be lost too—but never, ever let the mind be lost.¹⁷

**Verse 23**
> I make this entreaty to those who wish to guard the mind: guard mindfulness and introspection with every effort.¹⁸

**Verse 24**
> Just as a person afflicted by illness is unfit for all work, so too a mind impaired by these two is unfit for all work.

**Verse 25**
> What is learned, contemplated, and meditated upon does not remain in memory—like water in a leaky pot—for one whose mind lacks introspection.¹⁹

**Verse 26**
> Even many who are learned, faithful, and diligent become stained with downfalls through the fault of lacking introspection.

**Verse 27**
> Robbed by the thief of non-introspection, who follows after the theft of mindfulness, even those who have accumulated merit go to lower realms.²⁰

**Verse 28**
> This gang of affliction-thieves seeks an opportunity. Having found the opportunity, they rob us and destroy the life of higher rebirth.

**Verse 29**
> Therefore, never let mindfulness depart from the door of the mind. If it has gone, recall it by remembering the suffering of the lower realms.²¹

**Verse 30**
> For the fortunate who dwell with teachers, who are respectful through fear and instruction, mindfulness arises easily.²²

**Verse 31**
> The Buddhas and bodhisattvas have unobstructed vision everywhere. Everything is before them. I stand before them.²³

**Verse 32**
> Reflecting thus, one should abide in modesty, respect, and fear. Recollection of the Buddha will occur to such a one again and again.

**Verse 33**
> When mindfulness stands at the door of the mind for the purpose of guarding it, then introspection arrives, and once it has come, it does not go again.²⁴

## III. Training the Mind

### Verses 34–54: The Sentinel and the Log

**Verse 34**
> First, the mind should always be kept ready thus: "I must remain as if without senses, like a log."²⁵

**Verse 35**
> Fruitless glances should never be made. The gaze should always be cast downward, as if in meditation.

**Verse 36**
> For the sake of resting the eyes, one may occasionally look at the horizon. And seeing a mere appearance, one may look to acknowledge someone's presence.²⁶

**Verse 37**
> On a path, for awareness of danger, one may look repeatedly in the four directions. Having rested, one should look behind by turning.

**Verse 38**
> Having looked ahead and behind, one should go forward or back. Thus in all situations one should act having understood what is to be done.²⁷

**Verse 39**
> Having determined "The body should remain thus," and having undertaken the action, one should look again in between: "How is the body positioned?"

**Verse 40**
> Thus, with all effort, one should observe whether the mind-elephant is bound to the great pillar of the Dharma meditation.²⁸

**Verse 41**
> Thus the mind should be examined: "Where is my mind engaged?" And one should not abandon even for a moment the yoke of concentration.²⁹

**Verse 42**
> If one is unable to do this when connected with danger or celebration, one may act as one wishes.³⁰ But at the time of giving, disregard of ethics is taught.

**Verse 43**
> Having understood a task and set about it, one should not think of anything else.³¹ That task should be accomplished first, with the inner self intent upon it.

**Verse 44**
> Thus everything is well done. Otherwise, neither is accomplished, and the affliction of non-introspection grows.

**Verse 45**
> One should destroy whatever curiosity arises regarding various kinds of gossip and the many types of entertainment.³²

**Verse 46**
> When fruitless activities arise—playing with earth, tearing grass, drawing lines—remembering the Tathāgata's training, one should abandon them immediately, with fear.³³

**Verse 47**
> Whenever one wishes to move or wishes to speak, one should first examine one's own mind, then act with steadiness and skill.³⁴

**Verse 48**
> When one sees that one's own mind is attached or hostile, one should not act, one should not speak—one should remain like a log.³⁵

**Verse 49–50**
> When the mind is arrogant, mocking, filled with pride or conceit, derisive, crooked, or deceptive; when it makes a show of self-exaltation or disparagement of others; when it is contentious or aggressive—one should remain like a log.

**Verse 51**
> When the mind seeks gain, honor, renown, or seeks a following, or seeks service for myself—therefore I stand like a log.

**Verse 52**
> When the mind is indifferent to others' welfare, seeks one's own profit, or wishes to speak in an assembly—therefore I stand like a log.

**Verse 53**
> When the mind is impatient, lazy, fearful, impudent, garrulous, or attached to one's own faction—therefore I stand like a log.

**Verse 54**
> Seeing the mind thus afflicted or engaged in fruitless activity, the hero should always firmly restrain it with the antidote.³⁶

## IV. The Positive Mind

### Verses 55–58: Qualities to Cultivate

**Verse 55**
> Well-determined, serene, steady, respectful, modest, fearful of wrong, peaceful, intent on pleasing others.³⁷

**Verse 56**
> Unwearied by the conflicting desires of childish beings, compassionate, knowing "This arises from affliction in them."³⁸

**Verse 57**
> I shall hold the mind always under the power of myself and all beings, directed toward blameless objects, like a magical creation, without ego.³⁹

**Verse 58**
> Again and again recalling that the excellent moment was attained after so long, I shall hold the mind thus—immovable as Mount Meru.⁴⁰

---

## V. Contemplation of the Body

### Verses 59–70: The Foulness of the Physical

**Verse 59**
> Dragged here and there by vultures greedy for flesh,⁴¹ the body makes no resistance. Why then do you take action on its behalf?

**Verse 60**
> Mind, why do you guard this body, making it your own and becoming arrogant? If it is different from you, what loss is it to you?⁴²

**Verse 61**
> You fool! You do not claim a clean wooden doll.⁴³ Why do you guard this foul machine constructed of filth?

**Verse 62**
> First, with your own intellect, separate this bag of skin. Then, with the sword of wisdom, detach the flesh from the skeleton.⁴⁴

**Verse 63**
> Having separated even the bones, look at the marrow within. Consider for yourself: "What essence is there here?"⁴⁵

**Verse 64**
> Having sought thus with effort, you have not found any essence. Now say why you still guard this body today.

**Verse 65**
> You may not eat the impure flesh, you may not drink the blood, you may not suck the entrails—what will you do with the body?⁴⁶

**Verse 66**
> It is fitting to guard it as food for vultures and jackals.⁴⁷ But this body of humans is an instrument for action.

**Verse 67**
> Yet even as you guard it, pitiless death will seize the body and give it to the vultures. What will you do then?

**Verse 68**
> Thinking "He will not stay," one does not give clothes and such to a servant.⁴⁸ The body will eat and go—why do you make the expenditure?

**Verse 69**
> Having given it its wages, attend now to your own welfare. For not everything earned by the worker is given to him.

**Verse 70**
> Regarding the body as a ship, on account of coming and going, make the body go as you wish for the accomplishment of beings' welfare.⁴⁹

## VI. Conduct in Daily Life

### Verses 71–95: The Bodhisattva's Comportment

**Verse 71**
> Thus, having mastered oneself, one should always have a smiling face. One should give up frowning and contracting the brow. One should be the first to speak, a friend to the world.⁵⁰

**Verse 72**
> One should not throw down seats and such suddenly and noisily. One should not bang doors. One should always love silence.⁵¹

**Verse 73**
> The crane, the cat, and the thief, moving silently and inconspicuously, accomplish their desired goals. The practitioner should always act thus.⁵²

**Verse 74**
> One should accept with bowed head the words of those skilled in directing others, who help without being asked. One should always be everyone's student.⁵³

**Verse 75**
> One should say "Well done!" to all that is well spoken. Seeing one who does merit, one should gladden them with praise.⁵⁴

**Verse 76**
> One should speak of others' good qualities in private. When one's own qualities are spoken of, one should reflect that it is appreciation of those qualities.

**Verse 77**
> All undertakings are for the sake of satisfaction, which is hard to obtain even with wealth. Therefore I shall enjoy the satisfaction that is the joy in others' good qualities produced by their efforts.⁵⁵

**Verse 78**
> Here there is no loss for me, and great happiness in the next life. But through hostility there is the suffering of displeasure, and great suffering in the next life.

**Verse 79**
> One should speak with trustworthy, well-placed words, with clear meaning, pleasant, delightful to hear, rooted in compassion, soft and gentle.⁵⁶

**Verse 80**
> One should always look at beings directly, as if drinking them in with the eyes.⁵⁷ "Depending on these alone, I shall attain buddhahood."

**Verse 81**
> Great good arises from continuous, devoted practice toward the antidote, toward the field of good qualities and kindness, and toward the suffering.⁵⁸

**Verse 82**
> One should be skillful, diligent, and always self-reliant.⁵⁹ No opportunity should be given to anyone in any work.

**Verse 83**
> The perfections—generosity and so forth—are progressively superior. One should not abandon a greater one for a lesser, except for the bridge of conduct.⁶⁰

**Verse 84**
> Having understood thus, one should always be engaged in others' welfare. Even what is forbidden is permitted for the compassionate one who sees the benefit.⁶¹

**Verse 85**
> One should eat in moderation, sharing with those who have fallen, the unprotected, and those observing vows. One should give away everything except the three robes.⁶²

**Verse 86**
> One should not harm the body that serves the true Dharma for trivial purposes. In this way alone one quickly fulfills the hopes of beings.

**Verse 87**
> Therefore one should not give up one's life while one's compassionate intention is impure. But if the intention is equal, one should give it up.⁶³ Thus there is no loss.

**Verse 88**
> One should not teach Dharma to one who is disrespectful, who is healthy but wears a head covering, who carries an umbrella, staff, or weapon, or whose head is veiled.⁶⁴

**Verse 89**
> One should not teach the profound and vast to those of lesser capacity. One should treat the lesser and the greater Dharmas with equal respect, without women, without a man.⁶⁵

**Verse 90**
> One should not assign someone who is a vessel for the vast Dharma to the lesser Dharma. One should not attract them by forsaking conduct through sūtras and mantras.⁶⁶

**Verse 91**
> The open ejection of toothsticks and phlegm is unwelcome.⁶⁷ Urinating and such in usable water or on the ground is reprehensible.

**Verse 92**
> One should not eat with a full mouth, noisily, or with mouth wide open. One should not sit with legs dangling, nor rub both arms together.⁶⁸

**Verse 93**
> One should not travel, sleep, or sit alone with another's woman. Having seen and inquired what displeases people, one should avoid it.⁶⁹

**Verse 94**
> One should not indicate anything with a finger,⁷⁰ but respectfully with the right hand. One should point out the way with the whole hand in that manner.

**Verse 95**
> One should not wave the arms about and make noise over a small matter. Snapping fingers and such should be done. Otherwise one is unrestrained.⁷¹

**Verse 96**
> One should lie down in the direction one wishes, like the Lord at nirvāṇa.⁷² Introspective, quick to rise—first, obligatorily, by vow.

## VII. Final Instructions

### Verses 97–109: Study and Practice

**Verse 97**
> The conduct of bodhisattvas is said to be immeasurable. One should certainly practice the conduct of purifying the mind.⁷³

**Verse 98**
> Three times by day and three times by night one should recite the Three Sections.⁷⁴ Through that, relying on bodhicitta and the Victors, remaining downfalls are pacified.

**Verse 99**
> Whatever situations one encounters, whether by oneself or under others' power, one should train diligently in the trainings that apply to those situations.⁷⁵

**Verse 100**
> There is nothing that should not be trained in by the children of the Victors. For one abiding thus, there is nothing that is not merit.⁷⁶

**Verse 101**
> Directly or indirectly, one should do nothing except for the welfare of beings. And for the sake of beings alone, one should dedicate everything to awakening.⁷⁷

**Verse 102**
> One should never abandon the spiritual friend, even for one's life—one who holds the bodhisattva vow, who is skilled in the meaning of the Mahāyāna.⁷⁸

**Verse 103**
> One should learn the service to the teacher from the Śrīsaṃbhava-vimokṣa.⁷⁹ This and other teachings of the Buddha are to be known from reading the sūtras.

**Verse 104**
> The trainings are to be seen in the sūtras; therefore one should recite the sūtras. One should examine the root downfalls in the Ākāśagarbha-sūtra.⁸⁰

**Verse 105**
> The Śikṣāsamuccaya must certainly be examined again and again,⁸¹ for daily conduct is extensively shown there.

**Verse 106**
> Or, at least for the time being, see the Sūtrasamuccaya. And with effort, see the second one composed by the noble Nāgārjuna.⁸²

**Verse 107**
> From that, seeing what is forbidden and what is enjoined, practice the training for the sake of protecting the mind of worldly beings.⁸³

**Verse 108**
> This alone is the definition of introspection in brief: the repeated examination of the state of body and mind.⁸⁴

**Verse 109**
> I shall read this with my body. What is the use of mere verbal reading? What benefit comes to the sick from merely reading about medicine?⁸⁵
