## I. Offerings to the Three Jewels

### Verses 1–7: The Ultimate Gift of All Things

**Verse 1**
> In order to properly take hold of that jewel-mind,¹ I make offerings to the Tathāgatas, to the stainless jewel of the true Dharma, and to the offspring of the Buddhas, those oceans of virtue.

**Verse 2**
> As many flowers and fruits as there are, as many medicinal herbs as exist, as many jewels as are found in the world, and waters clear and delightful—

**Verse 3**
> —mountains made of precious gems and others too, forest regions lovely in their solitude, vines radiant with ornaments of blossoms, and trees with branches bent low with excellent fruit—

**Verse 4**
> —in the realms of gods and other beings, fragrant incense, wish-fulfilling trees² and jewel-trees, lakes adorned with lotuses, enchanting with the calls of swans—

**Verse 5**
> —crops that grow without cultivation and all other adornments worthy of offering, extending to the very limits of space—all these, which belong to no one—

**Verse 6**
> —these I take up mentally and present to the supreme Sages together with their spiritual heirs. May those supremely worthy of gifts,³ great in compassion, accept these from me out of kindness.

**Verse 7**
> I am devoid of merit,⁴ utterly destitute. I have nothing else to offer. Therefore, O Protectors, for my sake—you who are intent on the welfare of others—accept this by your own power.

---

## II. Self-Offering

### Verses 8–9: Complete Surrender

**Verse 8**
> I give myself entirely to the Victors and entirely to their offspring. O supreme beings, accept me! Devotedly, I enter into your service.⁵

**Verse 9**
> Through your acceptance of me, I become fearless in existence and work for the welfare of beings. I transcend my former misdeeds,⁶ and I commit no further transgressions.

---

## III. Elaborate Worship

### Verses 10–21: Bathing, Clothing, and Adorning the Buddhas

**Verse 10**
> In bathing chambers that are fragrant, with floors of shining crystal, with canopies brilliant with radiant pearls, upon pillars sparkling with gems and delightful to the mind—

**Verse 11**
> —there, with many great jeweled vessels filled with pleasing scented water and flowers, I bathe the Tathāgatas and their spiritual heirs, accompanied by songs and music.

**Verse 12**
> I dry their bodies with incomparable cloths, scented and stainless;⁷ then I present to them excellent robes, well-dyed and well-perfumed.

**Verse 13**
> With divine garments, soft, smooth, and of various splendor, and with the finest ornaments, I adorn Samantabhadra, Mañjughoṣa, Avalokiteśvara, and the rest.⁸

**Verse 14**
> With the supreme fragrances whose scent pervades a billion worlds, I anoint the bodies of all the Lords of Sages, gleaming like refined, polished, burnished gold.

**Verse 15**
> With māndārava⁹ blossoms, blue lotuses, jasmine, and all sweet-smelling, delightful flowers, I worship the Lords of Sages, most worthy of worship, with garlands arranged in beautiful forms.

**Verse 16**
> I envelop them with clouds of incense, rich and spreading with delightful fragrance. I present to them offerings of various foods—things to eat, to chew, and to drink.

**Verse 17**
> I present jeweled lamps arranged in rows upon golden lotuses, and upon floors anointed with fragrance I scatter lovely heaps of flowers.

**Verse 18**
> To those who are made of loving-kindness,¹⁰ I present celestial mansions radiant with beautiful strings of pearls and gems, adorning the directions, delightful with songs of praise.

**Verse 19**
> I hold aloft for the Great Sages, exceedingly beautiful, jeweled parasols with golden handles of lovely form, set with pearls.

**Verse 20**
> Henceforth, may delightful clouds of offerings arise, clouds of musical instruments and songs that bring joy to all beings.

**Verse 21**
> And upon all the jewels of the true Dharma, upon stūpas and sacred images, may rains of flowers and gems and other offerings fall continuously.

## IV. Emulation and Homage

### Verses 22–25: Following the Great Bodhisattvas

**Verse 22**
> Just as Mañjughoṣa and the others worship the Victors, so too do I worship the Tathāgatas, those Protectors, together with their spiritual heirs.

**Verse 23**
> With oceans of melodious verses I praise those oceans of virtue. May clouds of hymns and songs arise before them, without fail.

**Verse 24**
> With prostrations as numerous as the atoms in all buddha-fields, I bow down to all Buddhas of the three times,¹¹ together with the Dharma and the sublime Saṅgha.

**Verse 25**
> I venerate all stūpas and likewise the abodes of bodhisattvas. I pay homage to preceptors and to those practitioners worthy of veneration.

---

## V. Taking Refuge

### Verses 26–27: The Three Refuges and Confession

**Verse 26**
> I go for refuge to the Buddha until the seat of awakening. I go for refuge to the Dharma, and likewise to the assembly of bodhisattvas.¹²

**Verse 27**
> With palms joined, I make known to the fully awakened Buddhas abiding in all directions, and to the greatly compassionate bodhisattvas:

---

## VI. The Confession Proper

### Verses 28–31: Acknowledging Transgressions

**Verse 28**
> Throughout beginningless saṃsāra, in this very life and in others, whatever transgression has been committed by me, a beast,¹³ or caused to be committed by me—

**Verse 29**
> —and whatever I have foolishly rejoiced in, to my own destruction—that transgression I confess, tormented by remorse.¹⁴

**Verse 30**
> Whatever offense I have committed through body, speech, or mind against the Triple Gem, against mother and father, or against other teachers, out of contempt—

**Verse 31**
> —whatever terrible transgression has been done by me, a sinner afflicted with many faults—all that I confess, O Leaders.

---

## VII. Meditation on Death

### Verses 33–47: The Terror of Mortality¹⁵

**Verse 33**
> How shall I escape from this? Rescue me quickly! May death not come swiftly upon me while my transgressions remain unexhausted.

**Verse 34**
> This death—this assassin of trust¹⁶—does not examine what has been done and what is left undone. Whether healthy or sick, it is not to be trusted. It is a sudden great thunderbolt.

**Verse 35**
> For the sake of the beloved and the unloved alike, I have committed many transgressions. Yet I did not recognize that everything must be abandoned and I must depart.

**Verse 36**
> The unloved will not exist, my loved ones will not exist, I myself will not exist—nothing at all will exist.

**Verse 37**
> Everything that is experienced becomes a mere memory. Like something experienced in a dream, everything passes and is not seen again.

**Verse 38**
> Even as I stand here now, many loved and unloved ones have departed. But the terrible transgression committed on their account remains before me.¹⁷

**Verse 39**
> I did not consider that "I am merely a visitor."¹⁸ Through delusion, attachment, and aversion, I have committed many transgressions.

**Verse 40**
> Day and night, without rest, life is constantly diminishing. There is no replenishment for what is lost. Shall I not die?

**Verse 41**
> Though lying here on my bed, though surrounded by relatives, the pain of the cutting of the vital parts must be endured by me alone.¹⁹

**Verse 42**
> When seized by the messengers of Yama,²⁰ where is relative, where is friend? Merit alone is protection then—and that I have not cultivated.

**Verse 43**
> Attached to this impermanent life, not knowing this danger, I—in my heedlessness, O Protectors—have accumulated much transgression.

**Verse 44**
> Even one being led away today for the amputation of a limb grows faint:²¹ parched with thirst, with pitiful gaze, seeing the world differently.

**Verse 45**
> How much more so one who is overcome by the terrifying messengers of Yama, seized by great fever of terror, smeared with excrement?²²

**Verse 46**
> Searching for protection in the four directions with anguished glances, "Who will be the good one who will protect me from this great fear?"

**Verse 47**
> Seeing the directions devoid of protection, I shall fall again into confusion. What then shall I do in that place of great terror?

---

## VIII. Taking Refuge Renewed

### Verses 48–57: Surrender to the Protectors

**Verse 48**
> This very day I go for refuge to the mighty Lords of the World, to the Victors who strive for the protection of the world, who remove all fear.

**Verse 49**
> And the Dharma that they have realized, which destroys the fear of saṃsāra—I go for refuge to it genuinely, and likewise to the assembly of bodhisattvas.

**Verse 50**
> Trembling with fear, I give myself to Samantabhadra; and again, of my own accord, I give myself to Mañjughoṣa.²³

**Verse 51**
> To Avalokita, the Protector whose conduct is impelled by compassion—to him, terrified, I cry out with anguished voice: "May he protect me, a sinner!"

**Verse 52**
> To the noble Ākāśagarbha, to Kṣitigarbha,²⁴ and genuinely to all the greatly compassionate ones—searching for protection, I cry out.

**Verse 53**
> I bow to the Vajra-holder,²⁵ at the sight of whom the wicked messengers of Yama and other evil ones flee in terror in the four directions.

**Verse 54**
> Having transgressed your words before, now, seeing this danger, I go to you for refuge in fear. Remove my fear quickly!

**Verse 55**
> Even one frightened by a passing illness would not transgress the physician's instructions.²⁶ How much less one afflicted by the four hundred and four diseases?²⁷

**Verse 56**
> By even one of these, all people in Jambudvīpa perish, and a remedy for them is not found in any direction.

**Verse 57**
> If I would transgress the words of the physician who knows all, who removes all afflictions—shame on me, so utterly deluded!

---

## IX. Urgency and Resolve

### Verses 58–66: Final Confession

**Verse 58**
> I stand with great care even at other, lesser precipices. How much more at this precipice of a thousand leagues, lasting for eons?²⁸

**Verse 59**
> It is not right for me to sit at ease thinking, "Death will not come today." Inevitably the time shall come when I shall not exist.

**Verse 60**
> Who has given me fearlessness? How shall I escape? I shall certainly not exist. Why then is my mind at ease?

**Verse 61**
> What essence remains for me from previous experiences, now vanished?²⁹ Yet, attached to them, I have transgressed the words of teachers.

**Verse 62**
> Having left behind this living world, and my relatives and acquaintances likewise, I shall go alone somewhere.³⁰ What use to me are all these loved and unloved ones?

**Verse 63**
> Rather, this alone should be my concern, day and night: "How shall I escape from the suffering that will certainly arise from transgression?"

**Verse 64**
> Whatever transgression has been accumulated by me, a fool and a dullard—whether an offense by nature or an offense by precept³¹—

**Verse 65**
> —all that I confess, standing before the Protectors with palms joined, terrified of suffering, bowing again and again.

**Verse 66**
> May the Leaders acknowledge my transgression as transgression.³² This, O Protectors, was not good. I shall not do it again.

# Scholarly Apparatus

## Footnotes

¹ **[Cross-reference]** The chapter opens by linking to Chapter 1's discussion of bodhicitta as a "jewel" (*cittaratna*). The confession and offerings prepare the ground for formally adopting this awakening mind.

⁴ **[Sanskrit]** *apuṇyavān*: Devoid of merit, without accumulated positive karma. Śāntideva's confession of spiritual poverty.

⁵ **[Sanskrit]** *dāsatva*: Servitude, slavery. Śāntideva offers himself as a servant to the Buddhas and bodhisattvas—a radical act of surrender.

⁶ **[Sanskrit]** *samatikramāmi*: "I transcend" or "I cross beyond"—the confession enables liberation from past wrongdoing.

⁷ **[Sanskrit]** *ghauta* (from *ghṛṣṭa*): Rubbed, polished, immaculate. The cloths are both physically and spiritually pure.

⁸ **[Cross-reference]** Samantabhadra, Mañjughoṣa (Mañjuśrī), and Avalokiteśvara are the great bodhisattvas of practice, wisdom, and compassion respectively.

⁹ **[Sanskrit]** *māndārava*: A heavenly flower (*Erythrina indica*) that rains from the sky during auspicious events.

¹¹ **[Sanskrit]** *sarvatryadhvagatān*: Those who have gone (*gata*) through all (*sarva*) three (*tri*) times (*adhvan*)—past, present, and future Buddhas.

¹² **[Philosophical]** The traditional Three Refuges formula, with the important modification that Śāntideva takes refuge in the *bodhisattva* assembly rather than the *śrāvaka* sangha.

¹³ **[Sanskrit]** *paśu*: Beast, animal. Śāntideva refers to himself as an animal—a powerful expression of spiritual humility and acknowledgment of having lived heedlessly.

¹⁴ **[Sanskrit]** *paścāttāpa*: Remorse, literally "subsequent heat"—the burning of conscience after wrongdoing.

¹⁵ **[Textual]** Verse 32 is missing from the La Vallée Poussin edition and most manuscripts.

¹⁶ **[Sanskrit]** *viśrambhaghātaka*: "Assassin of trust"—death betrays all confidence in the continuity of life.

¹⁷ **[Philosophical]** The karmic debt (*pāpa*) remains even after those for whose sake it was incurred have departed. Karma is personal and inescapable.

¹⁸ **[Sanskrit]** *āgantuka*: A visitor, guest, traveler. We are merely passing through this life, yet we act as though we are permanent residents.

¹⁹ **[Philosophical]** The profound isolation of death: no one else can experience our dying for us.

²⁰ **[Sanskrit]** *yamadūta*: Messengers of Yama, the Lord of Death. They seize beings at death and conduct them to judgment.

²¹ **[Sanskrit]** *viśuṣyati*: "Dries up"—the mouth becomes parched with fear.

²² **[Sanskrit]** *purīṣotsargaveṣṭita*: Enveloped in the expulsion of excrement—terror causes loss of bodily control.

²³ **[Cross-reference]** The great bodhisattvas Samantabhadra (All-Good) and Mañjughoṣa (Sweet-Voiced, i.e., Mañjuśrī) represent the perfection of action and wisdom.

²⁵ **[Sanskrit]** *vajrin*: The Vajra-holder, i.e., Vajrapāṇi, the wrathful bodhisattva who protects the Dharma and terrifies evil forces.

²⁸ **[Sanskrit]** *yojanasāhasra prapāta*: A precipice (*prapāta*) of a thousand *yojanas* (leagues)—the fall into lower realms lasting countless ages.

²⁹ **[Philosophical]** What remains (*sāra*, essence) of all past experiences? Nothing. Yet we cling to their memory and commit wrongs for their sake.

³⁰ **[Sanskrit]** *ekākī kvāpi yāsyāmi*: "I shall go alone somewhere"—the utter solitude of the passage at death.

³¹ **[Sanskrit]** *prakṛtyā sāvadya* / *prajñaptyāvadya*: Offenses by nature (universally wrong) versus offenses by precept (wrong only because prohibited by religious rule).

³² **[Philosophical]** The formal confession formula: requesting the Buddhas to witness the acknowledgment of wrongdoing as wrongdoing—the precondition for purification.

## Key Concepts

- **Pāpadeśanā** (पापदेशना): Confession of transgressions. *Pāpa* = sin, wrongdoing, evil action; *deśanā* = declaration, confession, teaching.

- **Saṃsāra** (संसार): The cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. Here emphasized as "beginningless" (*anādimati*).

- **Yama** (यम): Lord of Death and judge of the dead. His "messengers" (*yamadūta*) terrify beings at death.

- **Dāsatva** (दास्त्व): Servitude. Śāntideva's total self-offering as servant to the Buddhas and bodhisattvas.

- **Paścāttāpa** (पश्चात्ताप): Remorse, the "subsequent burning" of conscience.

---

## Metrical Notes

- **Verses 1–19, 28–31, 33–47, 50–65**: *Vaṃśastha* meter (12 syllables per quarter)
- **Verses 20–27, 48–49, 66**: *Anuṣṭubh* meter (8 syllables per quarter)

The shift to anuṣṭubh for the formal refuge-taking and the concluding verses may reflect liturgical usage.
