# Chapter 1: The Benefits of Bodhicitta

## Bodhicittānuśaṃsaḥ — बोधिचित्तानुशंसः

*A Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel*

---

## I. Opening Homage and Statement of Purpose

### Verses 1–3: Invocation and Authorial Humility

**Verse 1**
> *oṃ namo buddhāya*
>
> Having reverently bowed to the Sugatas¹ together with their spiritual heirs,² to those endowed with the Dharmakāya,³ and to all who are worthy of veneration, I shall set forth, in accordance with scripture and in brief, the descent into the vow⁴ of the offspring of the Sugatas.

**Verse 2**
> There is nothing new to be said here, nor do I possess any skill in literary composition. Therefore, I have no thought for the benefit of others—I have composed this merely to perfume⁵ my own mind.

**Verse 3**
> For me, at least, through this work the momentum of faith⁶ for cultivating virtue increases. And should another of similar disposition see this, then it too may prove beneficial.

---

## II. The Precious Human Life

### Verses 4–6: Opportunity and Urgency

**Verse 4**
> This conjunction of favorable conditions,⁷ so exceedingly difficult to obtain, having been obtained, is capable of accomplishing the purpose of human existence.⁸ If benefit is not contemplated here and now, how will such a conjunction come again?

**Verse 5**
> Just as lightning, during the night, in the thick darkness of clouds, momentarily reveals brightness—so too, through the influence of the Buddhas, the mind of the world might occasionally, for an instant, turn toward meritorious actions.⁹

**Verse 6**
> Thus virtue is always weak, while the power of negativity is vast and exceedingly terrible. By what other virtue could it be conquered, were it not for the complete awakening mind?¹⁰

---

## III. The Efficacy of Bodhicitta

### Verses 7–14: Transformative Power

**Verse 7**
> The Lords of Sages,¹¹ contemplating for countless aeons, have seen this alone to be beneficial: through it, happiness, having easily increased, causes immeasurable floods of beings to overflow with joy.

**Verse 8**
> For those who wish to cross over the hundreds of sufferings of existence, for those who wish to remove the miseries of sentient beings, for those who wish to experience hundreds of happinesses—bodhicitta must never be abandoned.

**Verse 9**
> The wretched one, bound as a prisoner in the rounds of existence,¹² is called a "child of the Sugatas" the very instant bodhicitta arises. Such a one becomes worthy of veneration by the worlds of humans and gods.

**Verse 10**
> Taking hold of this impure form,¹³ it transforms it into the priceless image of the Victor's jewel. Grasp firmly this elixir¹⁴ known as bodhicitta, which is to be penetrated.

**Verse 11**
> Thoroughly examined by those of immeasurable wisdom,¹⁵ the sole caravan leaders of the world, and found to be of great value—you who are disposed to wander from destination to destination,¹⁶ grasp firmly this jewel of bodhicitta.

**Verse 12**
> Like the plantain tree¹⁷ that perishes after bearing fruit, all other virtues decay and are exhausted. But the tree of bodhicitta continually bears fruit and, never depleted, only grows.

**Verse 13**
> Though one has committed terrible misdeeds, one crosses beyond them instantly through reliance upon it—just as one escapes great dangers through reliance upon a hero. Why then is it not embraced by those who are ignorant?

**Verse 14**
> Like the fire at the end of an aeon,¹⁸ it incinerates great misdeeds in an instant. Its immeasurable benefits Lord Maitreya¹⁹ declared to the wise Sudhana.

---

## IV. The Two Types of Bodhicitta

### Verses 15–20: Aspiration and Application

**Verse 15**
> That bodhicitta is to be understood, in brief, as twofold: the mind of aspiration to awakening²⁰ and the mind of venturing forth toward awakening.²¹

**Verse 16**
> Just as the distinction is understood between one who wishes to go and one who is going, so too should the distinction between these two be understood by the wise, in that order.

**Verse 17**
> Great is the fruit of the aspiring bodhicitta even in saṃsāra, yet it does not produce uninterrupted merit as does the mind that has set forth.

**Verse 18**
> From the moment one takes up that mind with irreversible intention for the complete liberation of the limitless realm of sentient beings—

**Verse 19**
> —from that moment onward, whether asleep or distracted, uninterrupted streams of merit,²² vast as space, continually pour forth.

**Verse 20**
> The Tathāgata himself declared this, with supporting reasoning, in the *Subāhupṛcchā*,²³ for the sake of beings inclined toward lesser aspirations.

---

## V. The Immeasurable Merit of Bodhicitta

### Verses 21–27: Surpassing All Other Virtues

**Verse 21**
> One who, with a benevolent intention, thinks "I shall remove the headaches of beings"²⁴—such a one is grasped by immeasurable merit.

**Verse 22**
> How much more so one who wishes to remove the incomparable suffering of each and every being, and who wishes to accomplish immeasurable qualities for each?

**Verse 23**
> What mother or father has such benevolent intention? Do the gods, the ṛṣis,²⁵ or the Brahmās possess it?

**Verse 24**
> For those very beings, even this wish for their own benefit has never arisen before, even in dreams. How then could it arise for the sake of others?

**Verse 25**
> How does this extraordinary jewel among beings²⁶ arise—this intention for the benefit of others that does not arise even for their own benefit?

**Verse 26**
> How can the merit of this jewel-mind²⁷—the seed of the world's joy, the medicine for the world's suffering—be measured?

**Verse 27**
> Merely by aspiring for the benefit of others, one's worship of the Buddha is surpassed.²⁸ How much more so by striving for the complete happiness of all beings?

---

## VI. The Tragedy of Ordinary Beings

### Verses 28–31: The Paradox of Self-Harm

**Verse 28**
> Desiring to escape from suffering, they run toward suffering itself.²⁹ With the very desire for happiness, out of delusion they destroy their own happiness as if it were an enemy.

**Verse 29**
> For those who are starved for happiness and afflicted in so many ways—the bodhisattva satisfies them with all happinesses and cuts off all their afflictions.

**Verse 30**
> Such a one destroys even delusion. Where is there another equally good? Where is there such a friend, such merit?

**Verse 31**
> One who returns a favor is praised. What then need be said of the bodhisattva, who acts beneficently without expectation?³⁰

---

## VII. The Supreme Generosity of the Bodhisattva

### Verses 32–35: Incomparable Gift

**Verse 32**
> One who gives a meal to a few people—doing so contemptuously, providing mere sustenance for half a day—is honored by people as one who has done a virtuous deed.

**Verse 33**
> How much more so one who, for an immeasurable multitude of beings, throughout limitless time, bestows the inexhaustible fulfillment of all wishes—for beings as numerous as the reaches of space?

**Verse 34**
> Concerning such a lord of the feast,³¹ a child of the Victor: whosoever engenders hostility in their heart, they shall dwell in the hells for as many aeons as the moments of hostility—so the Lord declared.

**Verse 35**
> But one whose mind attains faith—the fruit produced thereby exceeds even that. For negativity requires great force against the children of the Victors, while virtue arises effortlessly.³²

---

## VIII. Concluding Homage

### Verse 36: Taking Refuge

**Verse 36**
> I pay homage to those beings³³ in whom that excellent jewel-mind has arisen. I go for refuge to those sources of happiness, through whom even injury becomes a bond to happiness.³⁴

---

*Thus concludes the first chapter, entitled "The Benefits of Bodhicitta," in the* Bodhicaryāvatāra *composed by the noble Śāntideva.*

## Footnotes

¹ **[Sanskrit]** *sugata* (सुगत): "Well-Gone One," an epithet of the Buddha emphasizing the completion of the path. The plural indicates all Buddhas of the three times.

² **[Sanskrit]** *sasutān*: "together with their sons/heirs," i.e., the bodhisattvas who are spiritually descended from the Buddhas.

³ **[Sanskrit]** *sadharmakāyān*: "endowed with the Dharmakāya." This early usage of the term refers to the corpus of Buddhist teachings embodied by awakened beings, rather than the later three-body (trikāya) technical meaning.

⁴ **[Sanskrit]** *saṃvarāvatāra* (संवरावतार): Descent into the vow. *Saṃvara* refers to the ethical restraint or vow; *avatāra* to descent or entry.

⁵ **[Sanskrit]** *vāsayitum*: To perfume, to habituate, to satisfy. The term *vāsanā* (habitual tendency) derives from the same root. "Perfume" captures the sense of gradual permeation, like scent permeating cloth.

⁶ **[Sanskrit]** *prasādavega*: The momentum or force (*vega*) of faith/devotion (*prasāda*). Faith here is not blind belief but lucid confidence born of understanding.

⁷ **[Sanskrit]** *kṣaṇasaṃpad*: "The wealth/endowment of the moment." This refers to the eight freedoms (*akṣaṇa*) and ten endowments (*saṃpatti*) that constitute a "precious human birth."

⁸ **[Sanskrit]** *puruṣārthasādhanī*: Capable of accomplishing *puruṣārtha*, the purpose of human existence—here understood as liberation and full awakening.

⁹ **[Philosophical]** The simile of lightning in darkness is a powerful image of the rarity and brevity of human inclination toward virtue. The Buddhist tradition consistently emphasizes that wholesome mental states are fragile and require intentional cultivation.

¹⁰ **[Sanskrit]** *saṃbodhicitta*: The complete awakening mind. This verse establishes bodhicitta as the only antidote powerful enough to overcome accumulated negativity.

¹¹ **[Sanskrit]** *munīndra*: "Lords of Sages," i.e., the Buddhas.

¹² **[Sanskrit]** *bhavacārakabandhana*: Bound as a wanderer in *bhava* (becoming/existence). The prison metaphor for saṃsāra is common throughout Buddhist literature.

¹³ **[Sanskrit]** *aśucipratimā*: The "impure image," referring to the ordinary human body-mind complex, here transformed by bodhicitta.

¹⁴ **[Sanskrit]** *rasajāta*: Literally "essence-born," referring to the alchemical elixir (*rasāyana*) that transmutes base metals into gold. The term *vedhanīya* ("to be penetrated") preserves the alchemical metaphor—bodhicitta penetrates and transforms the practitioner, not merely refining but fundamentally transmuting.

¹⁵ **[Sanskrit]** *aprameyadhī*: Those of immeasurable wisdom, i.e., the Buddhas.

¹⁶ **[Sanskrit]** *gatipattanavipravāsaśīlāḥ*: Those habituated to exile from destination-ports, i.e., wandering beings who journey from rebirth to rebirth.

¹⁷ **[Philosophical]** The plantain/banana tree (*kadalī*) was understood to die after fruiting. This simile emphasizes that ordinary virtues, however great, are exhausted when their karmic fruit ripens, while bodhicitta's merit is inexhaustible.

¹⁸ **[Sanskrit]** *yugāntakālānala*: The fire at the end of the cosmic age (*yuga*-end *kāla*-fire). This conflagration destroys the world-system between cosmic cycles.

¹⁹ **[Cross-reference]** Lord Maitreya's teaching to Sudhana is found in the *Gaṇḍavyūha-sūtra*, the final section of the vast *Avataṃsaka-sūtra*, where Maitreya expounds the benefits of bodhicitta in extensive detail.

²⁰ **[Sanskrit]** *bodhipraṇidhicitta*: The aspiring or wishing bodhicitta—the resolve to attain awakening for the benefit of all beings.

²¹ **[Sanskrit]** *bodhiprasthāna*: The venturing-forth or application bodhicitta—the actual engagement in bodhisattva conduct.

²² **[Sanskrit]** *puṇyadhārā*: Streams of merit. The metaphor of flowing water emphasizes the continuous, effortless nature of merit generation once application bodhicitta is established.

²³ **[Cross-reference]** *Subāhupṛcchā*: "The Questions of Subāhu," a sūtra in which the Buddha addresses the benefits of the aspiring mind even for those of limited capacity.

²⁴ **[Philosophical]** The headache metaphor establishes a baseline: even the minor intention to relieve minor suffering generates immense merit. The progression from verses 21–22 moves from minor to cosmic scale.

²⁵ **[Sanskrit]** *ṛṣi* (ऋषि): Seers or sages, referring in Buddhist context to the spiritually accomplished beings revered in both Buddhist and Brahmanical traditions.

²⁶ **[Sanskrit]** *sattvaratnaviśeṣa*: The extraordinary jewel among beings—the bodhisattva.

²⁷ **[Sanskrit]** *cittaratna*: The jewel-mind, i.e., bodhicitta.

²⁸ **[Philosophical]** This verse establishes the hierarchy: even aspiration surpasses ordinary Buddha-worship, while active bodhisattva practice surpasses even that.

²⁹ **[Modern]** This verse anticipates modern psychological insights about self-defeating behavior patterns. The paradox of running toward what harms us while fleeing what benefits us is central to Buddhist analysis of delusion (*moha*).

³⁰ **[Sanskrit]** *avyāpāritasādhu*: The bodhisattva who acts beneficently (*sādhu*) without being prompted or asked (*avyāpārita*)—indicating the spontaneous, unconditional nature of bodhisattva compassion.

³¹ **[Sanskrit]** *sattrapati*: Lord of the feast, host of the charitable distribution (*sattra*). The bodhisattva is likened to a supreme host who gives not mere food for half a day, but inexhaustible fulfillment.

³² **[Philosophical]** The asymmetry between virtue and negativity toward bodhisattvas: hostility generates massive karmic debt, while faith generates immense merit. This emphasizes the extraordinary spiritual status of those who have generated bodhicitta.

³³ **[Sanskrit]** *teṣāṃ śarīrāṇi*: "Their bodies"—Śāntideva offers physical homage to the very embodied forms in which bodhicitta has arisen.

³⁴ **[Philosophical]** The final verse encapsulates the bodhisattva paradox: even harm received by such beings becomes a cause of happiness, because their compassionate response transforms suffering into the path.

## Key Concepts

- **Bodhicitta** (बोधिचित्त): The awakening mind; the aspiration to attain complete enlightenment for the benefit of all sentient beings. This chapter establishes it as the supreme virtue that surpasses all others.

- **Sugata** (सुगत): "Well-Gone One"; epithet of the Buddha emphasizing successful completion of the spiritual path.

- **Saṃvara** (संवर): Discipline, ethical restraint, vow. The bodhisattva discipline involves specific precepts for benefiting beings.

- **Kṣaṇasaṃpad** (क्षणसम्पद्): The "momentary endowment" or precious human birth with its unique conditions for spiritual development.

- **Praṇidhicitta** (प्रणिधिचित्त): Aspiring bodhicitta—the wish to attain awakening.

- **Prasthānacitta** (प्रस्थानचित्त): Venturing bodhicitta—the active engagement in the path.

---

## Metrical Notes

- **Verses 1–14, 32–36**: Composed in *vaṃśastha* (वंशस्थ) meter, a variety of *jagatī* with 12 syllables per quarter.
- **Verses 15–31**: Composed in *anuṣṭubh* (अनुष्टुभ्), the standard 32-syllable meter with 8 syllables per quarter.

The shift from the more elaborate *vaṃśastha* in the opening and closing sections to the simpler *anuṣṭubh* in the doctrinal core may reflect the text's original composition for oral recitation and memorization.

# Chapter 2: Confession of Transgressions

## Pāpadeśanā — पापदेशना

*A Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel*

---

## I. Offerings to the Three Jewels

### Verses 1–7: The Ultimate Gift of All Things

**Verse 1**
> In order to properly take hold of that jewel-mind,¹ I make offerings to the Tathāgatas, to the stainless jewel of the true Dharma, and to the offspring of the Buddhas, those oceans of virtue.

**Verse 2**
> As many flowers and fruits as there are, as many medicinal herbs as exist, as many jewels as are found in the world, and waters clear and delightful—

**Verse 3**
> —mountains made of precious gems and others too, forest regions lovely in their solitude, vines radiant with ornaments of blossoms, and trees with branches bent low with excellent fruit—

**Verse 4**
> —in the realms of gods and other beings, fragrant incense, wish-fulfilling trees² and jewel-trees, lakes adorned with lotuses, enchanting with the calls of swans—

**Verse 5**
> —crops that grow without cultivation and all other adornments worthy of offering, extending to the very limits of space—all these, which belong to no one—

**Verse 6**
> —these I take up mentally and present to the supreme Sages together with their spiritual heirs. May those supremely worthy of gifts,³ great in compassion, accept these from me out of kindness.

**Verse 7**
> I am devoid of merit,⁴ utterly destitute. I have nothing else to offer. Therefore, O Protectors, for my sake—you who are intent on the welfare of others—accept this by your own power.

---

## II. Self-Offering

### Verses 8–9: Complete Surrender

**Verse 8**
> I give myself entirely to the Victors and entirely to their offspring. O supreme beings, accept me! Devotedly, I enter into your service.⁵

> Through your acceptance of me, I become fearless in existence and work for the welfare of beings. I transcend my former misdeeds,⁶ and I commit no further transgressions.

---

## III. Elaborate Worship

### Verses 10–21: Bathing, Clothing, and Adorning the Buddhas

**Verse 10**
> In bathing chambers that are fragrant, with floors of shining crystal, with canopies brilliant with radiant pearls, upon pillars sparkling with gems and delightful to the mind—

**Verse 11**
> —there, with many great jeweled vessels filled with pleasing scented water and flowers, I bathe the Tathāgatas and their spiritual heirs, accompanied by songs and music.

**Verse 12**
> I dry their bodies with incomparable cloths, scented and stainless;⁷ then I present to them excellent robes, well-dyed and well-perfumed.

**Verse 13**
> With divine garments, soft, smooth, and of various splendor, and with the finest ornaments, I adorn Samantabhadra, Mañjughoṣa, Avalokiteśvara, and the rest.⁸

**Verse 14**
> With the supreme fragrances whose scent pervades a billion worlds, I anoint the bodies of all the Lords of Sages, gleaming like refined, polished, burnished gold.

**Verse 15**
> With māndārava⁹ blossoms, blue lotuses, jasmine, and all sweet-smelling, delightful flowers, I worship the Lords of Sages, most worthy of worship, with garlands arranged in beautiful forms.

**Verse 16**
> I envelop them with clouds of incense, rich and spreading with delightful fragrance. I present to them offerings of various foods—things to eat, to chew, and to drink.

**Verse 17**
> I present jeweled lamps arranged in rows upon golden lotuses, and upon floors anointed with fragrance I scatter lovely heaps of flowers.

**Verse 18**
> To those who are made of loving-kindness,¹⁰ I present celestial mansions radiant with beautiful strings of pearls and gems, adorning the directions, delightful with songs of praise.

**Verse 19**
> I hold aloft for the Great Sages, exceedingly beautiful, jeweled parasols with golden handles of lovely form, set with pearls.

**Verse 20**
> Henceforth, may delightful clouds of offerings arise, clouds of musical instruments and songs that bring joy to all beings.

**Verse 21**
> And upon all the jewels of the true Dharma, upon stūpas and sacred images, may rains of flowers and gems and other offerings fall continuously.

---

## IV. Emulation and Homage

### Verses 22–25: Following the Great Bodhisattvas

**Verse 22**
> Just as Mañjughoṣa and the others worship the Victors, so too do I worship the Tathāgatas, those Protectors, together with their spiritual heirs.

**Verse 23**
> With oceans of melodious verses I praise those oceans of virtue. May clouds of hymns and songs arise before them, without fail.

**Verse 24**
> With prostrations as numerous as the atoms in all buddha-fields, I bow down to all Buddhas of the three times,¹¹ together with the Dharma and the sublime Saṅgha.

**Verse 25**
> I venerate all stūpas and likewise the abodes of bodhisattvas. I pay homage to preceptors and to those practitioners worthy of veneration.

---

## V. Taking Refuge

### Verses 26–27: The Three Refuges and Confession

**Verse 26**
> I go for refuge to the Buddha until the seat of awakening. I go for refuge to the Dharma, and likewise to the assembly of bodhisattvas.¹²

**Verse 27**
> With palms joined, I make known to the fully awakened Buddhas abiding in all directions, and to the greatly compassionate bodhisattvas:

---

## VI. The Confession Proper

### Verses 28–31: Acknowledging Transgressions

**Verse 28**
> Throughout beginningless saṃsāra, in this very life and in others, whatever transgression has been committed by me, a beast,¹³ or caused to be committed by me—

**Verse 29**
> —and whatever I have foolishly rejoiced in, to my own destruction—that transgression I confess, tormented by remorse.¹⁴

**Verse 30**
> Whatever offense I have committed through body, speech, or mind against the Triple Gem, against mother and father, or against other teachers, out of contempt—

**Verse 31**
> —whatever terrible transgression has been done by me, a sinner afflicted with many faults—all that I confess, O Leaders.

---

## VII. Meditation on Death

### Verses 33–47: The Terror of Mortality¹⁵

**Verse 33**
> How shall I escape from this? Rescue me quickly! May death not come swiftly upon me while my transgressions remain unexhausted.

**Verse 34**
> This death—this assassin of trust¹⁶—does not examine what has been done and what is left undone. Whether healthy or sick, it is not to be trusted. It is a sudden great thunderbolt.

**Verse 35**
> For the sake of the beloved and the unloved alike, I have committed many transgressions. Yet I did not recognize that everything must be abandoned and I must depart.

**Verse 36**
> The unloved will not exist, my loved ones will not exist, I myself will not exist—nothing at all will exist.

**Verse 37**
> Everything that is experienced becomes a mere memory. Like something experienced in a dream, everything passes and is not seen again.

**Verse 38**
> Even as I stand here now, many loved and unloved ones have departed. But the terrible transgression committed on their account remains before me.¹⁷

**Verse 39**
> I did not consider that "I am merely a visitor."¹⁸ Through delusion, attachment, and aversion, I have committed many transgressions.

**Verse 40**
> Day and night, without rest, life is constantly diminishing. There is no replenishment for what is lost. Shall I not die?

**Verse 41**
> Though lying here on my bed, though surrounded by relatives, the pain of the cutting of the vital parts must be endured by me alone.¹⁹

**Verse 42**
> When seized by the messengers of Yama,²⁰ where is relative, where is friend? Merit alone is protection then—and that I have not cultivated.

**Verse 43**
> Attached to this impermanent life, not knowing this danger, I—in my heedlessness, O Protectors—have accumulated much transgression.

**Verse 44**
> Even one being led away today for the amputation of a limb grows faint:²¹ parched with thirst, with pitiful gaze, seeing the world differently.

**Verse 45**
> How much more so one who is overcome by the terrifying messengers of Yama, seized by great fever of terror, smeared with excrement?²²

**Verse 46**
> Searching for protection in the four directions with anguished glances, "Who will be the good one who will protect me from this great fear?"

**Verse 47**
> Seeing the directions devoid of protection, I shall fall again into confusion. What then shall I do in that place of great terror?

---

## VIII. Taking Refuge Renewed

### Verses 48–57: Surrender to the Protectors

**Verse 48**
> This very day I go for refuge to the mighty Lords of the World, to the Victors who strive for the protection of the world, who remove all fear.

**Verse 49**
> And the Dharma that they have realized, which destroys the fear of saṃsāra—I go for refuge to it genuinely, and likewise to the assembly of bodhisattvas.

**Verse 50**
> Trembling with fear, I give myself to Samantabhadra; and again, of my own accord, I give myself to Mañjughoṣa.²³

**Verse 51**
> To Avalokita, the Protector whose conduct is impelled by compassion—to him, terrified, I cry out with anguished voice: "May he protect me, a sinner!"

**Verse 52**
> To the noble Ākāśagarbha, to Kṣitigarbha,²⁴ and genuinely to all the greatly compassionate ones—searching for protection, I cry out.

**Verse 53**
> I bow to the Vajra-holder,²⁵ at the sight of whom the wicked messengers of Yama and other evil ones flee in terror in the four directions.

**Verse 54**
> Having transgressed your words before, now, seeing this danger, I go to you for refuge in fear. Remove my fear quickly!

**Verse 55**
> Even one frightened by a passing illness would not transgress the physician's instructions.²⁶ How much less one afflicted by the four hundred and four diseases?²⁷

**Verse 56**
> By even one of these, all people in Jambudvīpa perish, and a remedy for them is not found in any direction.

**Verse 57**
> If I would transgress the words of the physician who knows all, who removes all afflictions—shame on me, so utterly deluded!

---

## IX. Urgency and Resolve

### Verses 58–66: Final Confession

**Verse 58**
> I stand with great care even at other, lesser precipices. How much more at this precipice of a thousand leagues, lasting for eons?²⁸

**Verse 59**
> It is not right for me to sit at ease thinking, "Death will not come today." Inevitably the time shall come when I shall not exist.

**Verse 60**
> Who has given me fearlessness? How shall I escape? I shall certainly not exist. Why then is my mind at ease?

**Verse 61**
> What essence remains for me from previous experiences, now vanished?²⁹ Yet, attached to them, I have transgressed the words of teachers.

**Verse 62**
> Having left behind this living world, and my relatives and acquaintances likewise, I shall go alone somewhere.³⁰ What use to me are all these loved and unloved ones?

**Verse 63**
> Rather, this alone should be my concern, day and night: "How shall I escape from the suffering that will certainly arise from transgression?"

**Verse 64**
> Whatever transgression has been accumulated by me, a fool and a dullard—whether an offense by nature or an offense by precept³¹—

**Verse 65**
> —all that I confess, standing before the Protectors with palms joined, terrified of suffering, bowing again and again.

**Verse 66**
> May the Leaders acknowledge my transgression as transgression.³² This, O Protectors, was not good. I shall not do it again.

*Thus concludes the second chapter, entitled "Confession of Transgressions," in the* Bodhicaryāvatāra *composed by the noble Śāntideva.*

## Footnotes

¹ **[Cross-reference]** The chapter opens by linking to Chapter 1's discussion of bodhicitta as a "jewel" (*cittaratna*). The confession and offerings prepare the ground for formally adopting this awakening mind.

² **[Sanskrit]** *kalpadruma*: Wish-fulfilling trees of the celestial realms that spontaneously provide whatever is desired.

³ **[Sanskrit]** *varadakṣiṇīya*: Supremely worthy recipients of gifts (*dakṣiṇā*), i.e., those whose purity makes offerings extraordinarily meritorious.

⁴ **[Sanskrit]** *apuṇyavān*: Devoid of merit, without accumulated positive karma. Śāntideva's confession of spiritual poverty.

⁵ **[Sanskrit]** *dāsatva*: Servitude, slavery. Śāntideva offers himself as a servant to the Buddhas and bodhisattvas—a radical act of surrender.

⁶ **[Sanskrit]** *samatikramāmi*: "I transcend" or "I cross beyond"—the confession enables liberation from past wrongdoing.

⁷ **[Sanskrit]** *ghauta* (from *ghṛṣṭa*): Rubbed, polished, immaculate. The cloths are both physically and spiritually pure.

⁸ **[Cross-reference]** Samantabhadra, Mañjughoṣa (Mañjuśrī), and Avalokiteśvara are the great bodhisattvas of practice, wisdom, and compassion respectively.

⁹ **[Sanskrit]** *māndārava*: A heavenly flower (*Erythrina indica*) that rains from the sky during auspicious events.

¹² **[Philosophical]** The traditional Three Refuges formula, with the important modification that Śāntideva takes refuge in the *bodhisattva* assembly rather than the *śrāvaka* sangha.

¹⁸ **[Sanskrit]** *āgantuka*: A visitor, guest, traveler. We are merely passing through this life, yet we act as though we are permanent residents.

¹⁹ **[Philosophical]** The profound isolation of death: no one else can experience our dying for us.

²⁰ **[Sanskrit]** *yamadūta*: Messengers of Yama, the Lord of Death. They seize beings at death and conduct them to judgment.

²¹ **[Sanskrit]** *viśuṣyati*: "Dries up"—the mouth becomes parched with fear.

²² **[Sanskrit]** *purīṣotsargaveṣṭita*: Enveloped in the expulsion of excrement—terror causes loss of bodily control.

²³ **[Cross-reference]** The great bodhisattvas Samantabhadra (All-Good) and Mañjughoṣa (Sweet-Voiced, i.e., Mañjuśrī) represent the perfection of action and wisdom.

²⁴ **[Sanskrit]** *Ākāśagarbha* (Space-Treasury) and *Kṣitigarbha* (Earth-Store)—celestial bodhisattvas of abundance and protection of beings in lower realms.

²⁵ **[Sanskrit]** *vajrin*: The Vajra-holder, i.e., Vajrapāṇi, the wrathful bodhisattva who protects the Dharma and terrifies evil forces.

²⁶ **[Modern]** The physician-patient metaphor: just as we would follow medical advice when ill, we should follow spiritual advice when spiritually diseased.

²⁷ **[Cross-reference]** The 404 diseases: traditional Indian medical teaching enumerated 4 classes of diseases × 101 subtypes.

²⁸ **[Sanskrit]** *yojanasāhasra prapāta*: A precipice (*prapāta*) of a thousand *yojanas* (leagues)—the fall into lower realms lasting countless ages.

²⁹ **[Philosophical]** What remains (*sāra*, essence) of all past experiences? Nothing. Yet we cling to their memory and commit wrongs for their sake.

³⁰ **[Sanskrit]** *ekākī kvāpi yāsyāmi*: "I shall go alone somewhere"—the utter solitude of the passage at death.

³¹ **[Sanskrit]** *prakṛtyā sāvadya* / *prajñaptyāvadya*: Offenses by nature (universally wrong) versus offenses by precept (wrong only because prohibited by religious rule).

³² **[Philosophical]** The formal confession formula: requesting the Buddhas to witness the acknowledgment of wrongdoing as wrongdoing—the precondition for purification.

- **Saṃsāra** (संसार): The cycle of birth, death, and rebirth. Here emphasized as "beginningless" (*anādimati*).

- **Yama** (यम): Lord of Death and judge of the dead. His "messengers" (*yamadūta*) terrify beings at death.

**Verse 10**
> This very self, my enjoyments, and all my virtue of the three times—all this I give away without attachment, for the accomplishment of the welfare of all beings.¹⁰

**Verse 11**

---

## IV. Self-Offering to All Beings

**Verse 12**
> I have rendered this self for the happiness of all embodied beings.¹² Let them always kill me, revile me, and shower me with dust.

**Verse 13**
> Let them play with my body, let them laugh at me and mock me. My body has been given to them—what use is this concern of mine for it?

**Verse 14**

**Verse 15**
> If their attitude toward me, whether angry or pleased, becomes a cause for the constant fulfillment of all their aims—¹⁴

> Just as the elements such as earth and the rest are enjoyed in various ways by innumerable beings extending to the limits of space—

**Verse 21**
> —so may I be a source of sustenance, in various ways, for the realm of beings extending to the limits of space, until all have attained nirvāṇa.²⁰

---

**Verse 26**
> Henceforth I must perform the actions befitting those of my own family,²⁵ so that no stain will come upon this pure family.

> This is the supreme medicine that pacifies the disease of the world. This is the tree of rest for beings exhausted from wandering on the paths of existence.²⁸

**Verse 30**
> This is the public bridge for crossing out of the lower realms.²⁹ This is the moon of mind that has risen to pacify the afflictions of the world.

**Verse 31**

# Scholarly Apparatus

## Footnotes

¹ **[Sanskrit]** *apāyaduḥkha*: Suffering of the *apāya*, the lower realms (hells, hungry ghosts, animals).

² **[Philosophical]** The sequence—bodhisattvahood and then buddhahood—indicates the path structure. Joy in others' spiritual attainments (*anumodanā*) is one of the seven-limb practice.

³ **[Sanskrit]** *cittotpādasamudra*: "Oceans of mind-generation"—the vast aspiration to awakening.

⁴ **[Sanskrit]** *dharmapradīpa*: The lamp of Dharma—teaching that illuminates the way out of suffering.

⁶ **[Sanskrit]** *sarvaduḥkhapraśāntikṛt*: One who brings about the complete pacification of all suffering.

⁷ **[Philosophical]** The threefold aspiration: to be medicine, physician, and nurse. This completeness characterizes bodhisattva compassion.

⁸ **[Sanskrit]** *durbhikṣāntarakalpa*: The intermediate famine aeons—periods of cosmic decline marked by shortage and suffering.

⁹ **[Sanskrit]** *nidhiḥ akṣaya*: Inexhaustible treasury. The bodhisattva aspires to be a limitless source of provisions.

¹⁰ **[Philosophical]** The three types of giving: self (*ātmabhāva*), possessions (*bhoga*), and merit (*śubha*). "Of the three times" indicates past, present, and future merit.

¹¹ **[Philosophical]** A profound equation: if nirvāṇa requires letting go of everything, then giving to beings accomplishes the same goal while benefiting others.

¹² **[Sanskrit]** *sukhīkṛta*: "Rendered happy" or "made available for happiness." The self is given over entirely for others' benefit.

¹³ **[Sanskrit]** *anarthaḥ kasyacit mā bhūt māmālambya*: "May no harm come to anyone taking me as a basis"—even when used by others.

¹⁴ **[Philosophical]** The radical extension: whether beings approach with anger or affection, may their relationship with the bodhisattva lead to the fulfillment of their aims.

¹⁵ **[Sanskrit]** *bodhibhāginaḥ*: "Sharers in awakening"—even those who slander or harm.

¹⁶ **[Cross-reference]** This verse parallels similar aspirations in the *Bhadracaryāpraṇidhāna*. The series—protector, guide, boat, bridge, causeway—covers all modes of assistance.

¹⁸ **[Sanskrit]** *bhadraghaṭa*: The excellent or auspicious vase, a ritual vessel of abundance.

¹⁹ **[Sanskrit]** *kalpavṛkṣa* and *kāmadhenu*: The wish-granting tree and the cow of desires—mythological sources of inexhaustible abundance.

²⁰ **[Philosophical]** The aspiration extends "until all have attained nirvāṇa"—the open-ended commitment characteristic of bodhicitta.

²¹ **[Cross-reference]** The phrase "just as...so too" (*yathā...tadvat*) marks the formal ritual of taking the bodhisattva vow, modeled on the Buddhas' own practice.

²² **[Sanskrit]** *śikṣiṣyāmi yathākramam*: "I shall train in their proper sequence"—the graduated path of bodhisattva practice.

²³ **[Sanskrit]** *puṣṭyartham*: For the purpose of strengthening or nourishing what has been adopted.

²⁴ **[Philosophical]** This exultation (*adya me saphalaṃ janma*) parallels liturgical formulas in ordination ceremonies. "Today" (*adya*) marks the transformative moment.

²⁵ **[Sanskrit]** *svakulocitakārin*: Actions befitting one's own family—the bodhisattva lineage.

²⁶ **[Sanskrit]** *saṃkārakūṭa*: Heap of refuse or rubbish. The blind person finding treasure is a powerful metaphor for the unlikely arising of bodhicitta in an ordinary being.

²⁷ **[Sanskrit]** *mṛtyuvināśa*: Destruction of death—bodhicitta destroys not just physical death but the cycle of birth and death.

²⁸ **[Sanskrit]** *bhavādhvabhramaṇaśrānta*: Exhausted from wandering on the paths of existence (*bhava*).

²⁹ **[Sanskrit]** *durgatyuttaraṇe setuḥ sāmānyaḥ*: A public (*sāmānya*) bridge for crossing out of the lower realms—available to all.

- **Anumodanā** (अनुमोदना): Rejoicing in virtue, sympathetic joy in others' merit and achievements.

- **Pariṇāmanā** (परिणामना): Dedication or turning over of merit toward the welfare of all beings.

- **Sukhasattra** (सुखसत्त्र): The feast of happiness—the bodhisattva offers limitless benefit like a great charitable feast.

---

## Metrical Notes

- **Verses 1–31**: *Anuṣṭubh* meter (8 syllables per quarter)
- **Verses 32–33**: *Vaṃśastha* meter (12 syllables per quarter)

The shift to the longer meter for the final two verses marks the climactic invitation.

# Chapter 4: Heedfulness Regarding Bodhicitta

## Bodhicittāpramādaḥ — बोधिचित्ताप्रमादः

*A Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel*

---

## I. The Obligation of the Vow

### Verses 1–6: Keeping the Commitment

**Verse 1**
> Having thus firmly taken hold of bodhicitta, a child of the Victors should always make effort, without laziness, not to transgress the trainings.¹

**Verse 2**
> Whatever is undertaken hastily, whatever is not properly considered—regarding these it is fitting to say "I may or may not do this."² Even after making a promise, this is appropriate.

**Verse 3**
> But that which has been examined by the Buddhas and their offspring of great wisdom,³ and by me too according to my ability—in that matter, why should I delay?

**Verse 4**
> If, having promised thus, I do not accomplish it through action, then having deceived all these beings, what destiny will be mine?⁴

**Verse 5**
> It is said that one who, even after merely thinking of giving, does not give, becomes a hungry ghost—even over a trifling thing.⁵

**Verse 6**
> How much more so one who, having sincerely proclaimed supreme happiness with a loud voice, deceives the entire world—what destiny will be mine?

---

## II. The Power of Bodhicitta to Liberate

### Verses 7–11: Cosmic Consequences

**Verse 7**
> The Omniscient One alone knows this inconceivable course of karma: that even one who abandons bodhicitta, he liberates such a one.⁶

**Verse 8**
> Therefore, for a bodhisattva, every downfall is exceedingly serious, for when he falls, he causes harm to the welfare of all beings.

**Verse 9**
> And whoever else creates, even for a moment, an obstacle to his merit—there is no end to that one's lower rebirths, since he has destroyed the welfare of beings.⁷

**Verse 10**
> If one would be destroyed by destroying the welfare of even a single being, how much more by destroying the welfare of embodied beings throughout the expanse of space?

**Verse 11**
> Thus, oscillating in saṃsāra through the force of downfalls and the force of bodhicitta, one is long delayed in attaining the stages.⁸

---

## III. Urgency and the Precious Human Life

### Verses 12–23: Now or Never

**Verse 12**
> Therefore, what I have vowed must be accomplished by me with diligence. If effort is not made today, I have gone from depth to depth.⁹

**Verse 13**
> Immeasurable Buddhas have passed, seekers of all beings, but through my own faults I did not come into the range of their healing.¹⁰

**Verse 14**
> And if today I remain just as before, I shall again and again obtain lower rebirths, disease, death, cutting, splitting, and the rest.

**Verse 15**
> When shall I obtain—so exceedingly difficult to obtain—the arising of a Tathāgata, faith, human existence, and fitness for cultivating virtue?¹¹

**Verse 16**
> This day of health, with food, without calamity—life is a fleeting moment, deceptive. The body is like something borrowed.¹²

**Verse 17**
> Through such conduct of mine, human existence is not obtained again. When human existence is not obtained, there is only evil—whence virtue?

**Verse 18**
> If I do not perform virtue even when fit for virtue, what shall I do when bewildered by the sufferings of the lower realms?

**Verse 19**
> When one does not perform virtue and only accumulates evil, the very word "higher rebirth" is destroyed for hundreds of millions of aeons.

**Verse 20**
> Therefore the Blessed One said that human life is exceedingly difficult to obtain—like a turtle putting its neck through the hole of a yoke floating on the great ocean.¹³

**Verse 21**
> For evil committed in a single moment one dwells in Avīci for an aeon.¹⁴ What talk then of higher rebirth when evil has been accumulated since beginningless time?

**Verse 22**
> And having experienced just that, one is not freed. For while experiencing that, one gives birth to further evil.¹⁵

**Verse 23**
> There is no greater deception than this, there is no greater delusion than this: that having obtained such a moment, I have not practiced virtue.

---

## IV. The Fire of Regret

### Verses 24–27: Torment to Come

**Verse 24**
> If I reflect thus and yet fall again into confusion, I shall lament for a long time, tormented by the messengers of Yama.

**Verse 25**
> For a long time the unbearable fire of hell will burn my body. For a long time the fire of remorse will burn my untrained mind.

**Verse 26**
> Somehow I have reached this beneficial ground, so difficult to reach, yet knowingly I am being led again to those same hells.¹⁶

**Verse 27**
> Here I have no will of my own—I am as if bewildered by spells. I do not know by what I am confused. Who is it that dwells within me?¹⁷

---

## V. The Inner Enemies

### Verses 28–35: Afflictions as Foes

**Verse 28**
> The enemies that are craving, aversion, and the rest have no hands, no feet. They are not brave, they are not wise. How have I been made a slave by them?¹⁸

**Verse 29**
> Stationed in my very mind, they strike at me at their ease. Yet even at that I do not become angry—shame on my misplaced patience!

**Verse 30**
> If all the gods and all humans were my enemies, even they could not lead me to the fire of Avīci.¹⁹

**Verse 31**
> These powerful enemies, the afflictions, throw me there in an instant—where, if even Mount Meru met it, not even ashes would be found.

**Verse 32**
> The lifespan of no other enemy is as long as this—beginningless and endless, as long as the great duration of my affliction-enemies.²⁰

**Verse 33**
> All others, if served agreeably, work for my benefit. But these afflictions, when served, only cause me more suffering.²¹

**Verse 34**
> Thus, while constant, long-lasting enemies—sole causes of flooding torrents of misfortune—dwell in my heart, how can I dwell fearlessly enjoying saṃsāra with delight?

**Verse 35**
> These are the jailers of the prison of existence, the executioners even in the hells. If they dwell in the cage of craving within my mental home, how can there be happiness for me?

---

## VI. The Warrior's Resolve

### Verses 36–42: Declaration of War

**Verse 36**
> Therefore I shall not lay down this burden until these enemies are slain before my eyes. Even regarding a minor offender, the proud, bound in anger, do not sleep until they have struck him down.²²

**Verse 37**
> On the battlefield, striving fiercely to strike down natural enemies who are subject to the suffering of mortality anyway, men do not turn back, ignoring the pain of arrows and spears.²³

**Verse 38**
> How much less should I be subject to depression and despair now, being engaged in striking down the natural enemies that are the constant causes of all suffering, even by hundreds of misfortunes?

**Verse 39**
> People display upon their bodies the wounds inflicted by enemies without reason, like ornaments. Why then should sufferings hinder me, engaged in accomplishing a great goal?²⁴

**Verse 40**
> Fishermen, outcasts, farmers, and the like, their minds fixed on merely their own livelihood, endure hardships of cold, heat, and so forth. Why do I not endure for the sake of the world's welfare?²⁵

**Verse 41**
> Having vowed to liberate beings throughout space extending to the ten directions from afflictions, I have not even freed myself from afflictions.

**Verse 42**
> Speaking like that without knowing my own measure, was I not a madman then? Therefore I shall never turn back from destroying afflictions.²⁶

---

## VII. Commitment to Victory

### Verses 43–48: Unswerving Resolve

**Verse 43**
> In this I shall be grasping, bound in enmity, a combatant—except for that affliction that is connected with destroying afflictions.²⁷

**Verse 44**
> Let my entrails spill out if they will, let my head fall—but I shall never bow down before the enemies that are the afflictions.²⁸

**Verse 45**
> An exiled enemy may find a foothold in another land, from where, having regained his strength, he returns. But the course of the affliction-enemy is not like this.²⁹

**Verse 46**
> Expelled from my mind, where would he go? Where would he stay while contriving to destroy me? I simply lack effort—wretched are the afflictions, they are conquered through the eye of wisdom.³⁰

**Verse 47**
> Afflictions do not dwell in sense objects, nor in the sense faculties, nor in between, nor elsewhere. Where then do they dwell, these that torment the whole world? This is mere illusion. Therefore, release your heart from fear, cultivate effort for wisdom.³¹ Why do you needlessly afflict yourself in the hells?

**Verse 48**
> Having determined thus, I make effort for the accomplishment of the trainings as taught. How can one whose illness is curable by a physician's instructions become healthy if he strays from them?³²

# Scholarly Apparatus

## Footnotes

¹ **[Sanskrit]** *śikṣā*: The trainings or precepts of the bodhisattva path. *Atikrama*: transgression.

² **[Philosophical]** Śāntideva distinguishes between impulsive promises (which may be reconsidered) and the bodhisattva vow (which has been carefully examined).

³ **[Sanskrit]** *mahāprājña*: Those of great wisdom—the bodhisattvas.

⁴ **[Sanskrit]** *visaṃvādya*: Having deceived or lied to.

⁵ **[Cross-reference]** The doctrine that unfulfilled mental intentions to give can lead to rebirth as a hungry ghost (*preta*) appears in various Abhidharma texts.

⁶ **[Philosophical]** Even though abandoning bodhicitta is a grave fault, the Omniscient One eventually liberates even those who fall. This shows both the seriousness of the vow and the ultimate compassion of the path.

⁷ **[Sanskrit]** *sattvārtha-ghātin*: Destroyer of the welfare of beings—the gravest charge.

⁸ **[Sanskrit]** *bhūmi-prāpti*: Attainment of the stages (*bhūmi*) of the bodhisattva path.

⁹ **[Sanskrit]** *talena talam*: From depth to depth—a vivid image of descending through lower realms.

¹⁰ **[Sanskrit]** *cikitsā-gocara*: The range or scope of healing—the Buddha as physician.

¹¹ **[Sanskrit]** *kuśalābhyāsa-yogyatva*: Fitness for practicing virtue—a defining feature of the precious human birth.

¹² **[Sanskrit]** *upācita-kopa*: Something borrowed or on loan. Life is not our permanent possession.

¹³ **[Cross-reference]** The blind turtle simile appears in the *Saṃyutta Nikāya* and many Mahāyāna texts. A blind turtle surfaces once every hundred years; a yoke with a hole floats on the ocean. The chance of the turtle's neck entering the hole represents the rarity of human birth.

¹⁴ **[Sanskrit]** *avīci*: The lowest and most terrible of the hot hells.

¹⁵ **[Philosophical]** The vicious cycle: suffering in hell does not purify us; instead, suffering beings generate more negative karma through anger, despair, and hatred.

¹⁶ **[Sanskrit]** *hitabhūmi*: Beneficial ground—the precious human birth with all its opportunities.

¹⁷ **[Philosophical]** The bewilderment described here is the key insight: we are controlled by something we do not understand.

¹⁸ **[Sanskrit]** *dāsī-kṛta*: Made into a slave or servant. The afflictions (*kleśa*) are portrayed as pathetic enemies who have nonetheless conquered us.

¹⁹ **[Sanskrit]** *avīcikaṃ vahni*: The fire of Avīci hell.

²⁰ **[Philosophical]** The afflictions' lifespan is *anādi-anta*—beginningless and endless—unless actively countered.

²¹ **[Philosophical]** The contrast: ordinary enemies can be friends if treated well; afflictions, when indulged, only grow stronger.

²² **[Philosophical]** Śāntideva invokes worldly honor culture to shame himself into spiritual effort.

²³ **[Sanskrit]** *raṇa-śiras*: The head of battle, the front line.

²⁴ **[Philosophical]** Warriors display scars as badges of honor; the bodhisattva should view spiritual struggles similarly.

²⁵ **[Sanskrit]** *kaivarta-caṇḍāla-kṛṣīvala*: Fishermen, outcasts, farmers—those of low social status who nonetheless endure hardship for mere livelihood.

²⁶ **[Sanskrit]** *unmataka*: Madman. Śāntideva calls himself insane for the gap between his vow and his practice.

²⁷ **[Philosophical]** A paradox: the only affliction permitted is the "affliction" of destroying afflictions.

²⁸ **[Sanskrit]** *avanati*: Bowing down, submission. This verse has become famous for its fierce resolve.

²⁹ **[Philosophical]** The image of an exiled enemy regrouping elsewhere; afflictions, once truly uprooted, have nowhere to go.

³⁰ **[Sanskrit]** *prajñā-dṛṣṭi-sādhya*: Conquered through the eye of wisdom—insight dissolves afflictions.

³¹ **[Philosophical]** This crucial verse establishes that afflictions have no ultimate location or substance—they are *māyā* (illusion). This is key Mādhyamaka doctrine.

³² **[Cross-reference]** The physician metaphor again: the Buddha's teachings are medicine; we must follow the prescription.

## Key Concepts

- **Apramāda** (अप्रमाद): Non-heedlessness, vigilance, conscientious effort. The opposite of spiritual laziness.

- **Kleśa** (क्लेश): Afflictions, mental disturbances—craving, aversion, delusion, and their derivatives. The "inner enemies."

- **Avīci** (अवीचि): The lowest hell, realm of uninterrupted suffering.

- **Prajñā-dṛṣṭi** (प्रज्ञादृष्टि): The eye of wisdom that sees through the illusion of afflictions.

## Metrical Notes

- **Verses 1–35**: *Anuṣṭubh* meter (8 syllables per quarter)
- **Verses 36–48**: Various longer meters (*vaṃśastha*, *vasantatilakā*) for dramatic emphasis

The shift to longer meters in the latter half marks the chapter's escalation into warrior rhetoric.

# Chapter 5: The Guarding of Introspection

## Saṃprajanyarakṣaṇam — संप्रजन्यरक्षणम्

*A Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel*

---

## I. The Centrality of Mind

### Verses 1–18: Mind as the Root of All

**Verse 1**
> One who wishes to guard the training must diligently guard the mind.¹ It is impossible to guard the training if one does not guard the wandering mind.

**Verse 2**
> Uncontrolled, maddened elephants do not cause as much harm in this world as is caused by the mind-elephant let loose in Avīci and elsewhere.²

**Verse 3**
> If the mind-elephant is bound on all sides by the rope of mindfulness, all fear disappears and all good comes near.³

**Verse 4–5**
> Tigers, lions, elephants, bears, serpents, all enemies, all the guardians of hell, ḍākinīs, and rākṣasas⁴—all these become bound by binding the one mind alone. By taming the one mind alone, all are tamed.

**Verse 6**
> For the Teacher of Truth has said that all fears and immeasurable sufferings arise from the mind itself.⁵

**Verse 7**
> By whom were the weapons of hell forged with such effort? By whom was the floor of heated iron made? Whence came those women?⁶

**Verse 8**
> The Sage declared that all such things arise from the sinful mind. Therefore there is nothing more terrifying in the three worlds than the mind.

**Verse 9**
> If the perfection of generosity consisted of making the world free from poverty, then since the world is still poor, how did the former Protectors perfect it?⁷

**Verse 10**
> The perfection of generosity is said to be the mind of giving away all things to all beings, together with the fruit of that. Therefore, it is the mind itself.⁸

**Verse 11**
> Where can fish and the like be led so that I will not kill them? When the mind of renunciation is obtained, that is considered the perfection of ethics.⁹

**Verse 12**
> How many wicked people, limitless as the sky, can I kill? When the mind of anger is killed, all enemies are killed.¹⁰

**Verse 13**
> Where would there be leather to cover the entire earth? The earth is covered with leather merely by the leather of my sandals.¹¹

**Verse 14**
> Similarly, I am unable to restrain external things. I shall restrain my own mind. What is the use of restraining other things?

**Verse 15**
> Even accompanied by speech and body, a mind of weak application does not produce results like those of the sharp mind alone—even to the state of Brahmā.¹²

**Verse 16**
> The Omniscient One said that all recitations and austerities, though performed for a long time, are simply pointless if the mind is directed elsewhere, distracted.¹³

**Verse 17**
> Those who have not cultivated this mind—the secret essence of all Dharma—wander pointlessly in space, seeking to destroy suffering and attain happiness.

**Verse 18**
> Therefore I must keep my mind well-placed and well-guarded. Apart from the vow of guarding the mind, what use are many vows to me?¹⁴

---

## II. Mindfulness and Introspection

### Verses 19–33: The Foundation of Practice

**Verse 19**
> Just as one in the midst of an unruly crowd carefully protects a wound, so one in the midst of bad company should always protect the wound of the mind.¹⁵

**Verse 20**
> Fearing a little pain from a wound, I protect the wound carefully. Fearing the crushing of the Hell-Mountains, why do I not protect the wound of the mind?

**Verse 21**
> Living in this way, even among wicked people, even among attractive people, the steadfast practitioner is not shattered.¹⁶

**Verse 22**
> Let gains, honor, and physical life be lost—let other virtues be lost too—but never, ever let the mind be lost.¹⁷

**Verse 23**
> I make this entreaty to those who wish to guard the mind: guard mindfulness and introspection with every effort.¹⁸

**Verse 24**
> Just as a person afflicted by illness is unfit for all work, so too a mind impaired by these two is unfit for all work.

**Verse 25**
> What is learned, contemplated, and meditated upon does not remain in memory—like water in a leaky pot—for one whose mind lacks introspection.¹⁹

**Verse 26**
> Even many who are learned, faithful, and diligent become stained with downfalls through the fault of lacking introspection.

**Verse 27**
> Robbed by the thief of non-introspection, who follows after the theft of mindfulness, even those who have accumulated merit go to lower realms.²⁰

**Verse 28**
> This gang of affliction-thieves seeks an opportunity. Having found the opportunity, they rob us and destroy the life of higher rebirth.

**Verse 29**
> Therefore, never let mindfulness depart from the door of the mind. If it has gone, recall it by remembering the suffering of the lower realms.²¹

**Verse 30**
> For the fortunate who dwell with teachers, who are respectful through fear and instruction, mindfulness arises easily.²²

**Verse 31**
> The Buddhas and bodhisattvas have unobstructed vision everywhere. Everything is before them. I stand before them.²³

**Verse 32**
> Reflecting thus, one should abide in modesty, respect, and fear. Recollection of the Buddha will occur to such a one again and again.

**Verse 33**
> When mindfulness stands at the door of the mind for the purpose of guarding it, then introspection arrives, and once it has come, it does not go again.²⁴

---

## III. Training the Mind

### Verses 34–54: The Sentinel and the Log

**Verse 34**
> First, the mind should always be kept ready thus: "I must remain as if without senses, like a log."²⁵

**Verse 35**
> Fruitless glances should never be made. The gaze should always be cast downward, as if in meditation.

**Verse 36**
> For the sake of resting the eyes, one may occasionally look at the horizon. And seeing a mere appearance, one may look to acknowledge someone's presence.²⁶

**Verse 37**
> On a path, for awareness of danger, one may look repeatedly in the four directions. Having rested, one should look behind by turning.

**Verse 38**
> Having looked ahead and behind, one should go forward or back. Thus in all situations one should act having understood what is to be done.²⁷

**Verse 39**
> Having determined "The body should remain thus," and having undertaken the action, one should look again in between: "How is the body positioned?"

**Verse 40**
> Thus, with all effort, one should observe whether the mind-elephant is bound to the great pillar of the Dharma meditation.²⁸

**Verse 41**
> Thus the mind should be examined: "Where is my mind engaged?" And one should not abandon even for a moment the yoke of concentration.²⁹

**Verse 42**
> If one is unable to do this when connected with danger or celebration, one may act as one wishes.³⁰ But at the time of giving, disregard of ethics is taught.

**Verse 43**
> Having understood a task and set about it, one should not think of anything else.³¹ That task should be accomplished first, with the inner self intent upon it.

**Verse 44**
> Thus everything is well done. Otherwise, neither is accomplished, and the affliction of non-introspection grows.

**Verse 45**
> One should destroy whatever curiosity arises regarding various kinds of gossip and the many types of entertainment.³²

**Verse 46**
> When fruitless activities arise—playing with earth, tearing grass, drawing lines—remembering the Tathāgata's training, one should abandon them immediately, with fear.³³

**Verse 47**
> Whenever one wishes to move or wishes to speak, one should first examine one's own mind, then act with steadiness and skill.³⁴

**Verse 48**
> When one sees that one's own mind is attached or hostile, one should not act, one should not speak—one should remain like a log.³⁵

**Verse 49–50**
> When the mind is arrogant, mocking, filled with pride or conceit, derisive, crooked, or deceptive; when it makes a show of self-exaltation or disparagement of others; when it is contentious or aggressive—one should remain like a log.

**Verse 51**
> When the mind seeks gain, honor, renown, or seeks a following, or seeks service for myself—therefore I stand like a log.

**Verse 52**
> When the mind is indifferent to others' welfare, seeks one's own profit, or wishes to speak in an assembly—therefore I stand like a log.

**Verse 53**
> When the mind is impatient, lazy, fearful, impudent, garrulous, or attached to one's own faction—therefore I stand like a log.

**Verse 54**
> Seeing the mind thus afflicted or engaged in fruitless activity, the hero should always firmly restrain it with the antidote.³⁶

---

## IV. The Positive Mind

### Verses 55–58: Qualities to Cultivate

**Verse 55**
> Well-determined, serene, steady, respectful, modest, fearful of wrong, peaceful, intent on pleasing others.³⁷

**Verse 56**
> Unwearied by the conflicting desires of childish beings, compassionate, knowing "This arises from affliction in them."³⁸

**Verse 57**
> I shall hold the mind always under the power of myself and all beings, directed toward blameless objects, like a magical creation, without ego.³⁹

**Verse 58**
> Again and again recalling that the excellent moment was attained after so long, I shall hold the mind thus—immovable as Mount Meru.⁴⁰

---

## V. Contemplation of the Body

### Verses 59–70: The Foulness of the Physical

**Verse 59**
> Dragged here and there by vultures greedy for flesh,⁴¹ the body makes no resistance. Why then do you take action on its behalf?

**Verse 60**
> Mind, why do you guard this body, making it your own and becoming arrogant? If it is different from you, what loss is it to you?⁴²

**Verse 61**
> You fool! You do not claim a clean wooden doll.⁴³ Why do you guard this foul machine constructed of filth?

**Verse 62**
> First, with your own intellect, separate this bag of skin. Then, with the sword of wisdom, detach the flesh from the skeleton.⁴⁴

**Verse 63**
> Having separated even the bones, look at the marrow within. Consider for yourself: "What essence is there here?"⁴⁵

**Verse 64**
> Having sought thus with effort, you have not found any essence. Now say why you still guard this body today.

**Verse 65**
> You may not eat the impure flesh, you may not drink the blood, you may not suck the entrails—what will you do with the body?⁴⁶

**Verse 66**
> It is fitting to guard it as food for vultures and jackals.⁴⁷ But this body of humans is an instrument for action.

**Verse 67**
> Yet even as you guard it, pitiless death will seize the body and give it to the vultures. What will you do then?

**Verse 68**
> Thinking "He will not stay," one does not give clothes and such to a servant.⁴⁸ The body will eat and go—why do you make the expenditure?

**Verse 69**
> Having given it its wages, attend now to your own welfare. For not everything earned by the worker is given to him.

**Verse 70**
> Regarding the body as a ship, on account of coming and going, make the body go as you wish for the accomplishment of beings' welfare.⁴⁹

---

## VI. Conduct in Daily Life

### Verses 71–95: The Bodhisattva's Comportment

**Verse 71**
> Thus, having mastered oneself, one should always have a smiling face. One should give up frowning and contracting the brow. One should be the first to speak, a friend to the world.⁵⁰

**Verse 72**
> One should not throw down seats and such suddenly and noisily. One should not bang doors. One should always love silence.⁵¹

**Verse 73**
> The crane, the cat, and the thief, moving silently and inconspicuously, accomplish their desired goals. The practitioner should always act thus.⁵²

**Verse 74**
> One should accept with bowed head the words of those skilled in directing others, who help without being asked. One should always be everyone's student.⁵³

**Verse 75**
> One should say "Well done!" to all that is well spoken. Seeing one who does merit, one should gladden them with praise.⁵⁴

**Verse 76**
> One should speak of others' good qualities in private. When one's own qualities are spoken of, one should reflect that it is appreciation of those qualities.

**Verse 77**
> All undertakings are for the sake of satisfaction, which is hard to obtain even with wealth. Therefore I shall enjoy the satisfaction that is the joy in others' good qualities produced by their efforts.⁵⁵

**Verse 78**
> Here there is no loss for me, and great happiness in the next life. But through hostility there is the suffering of displeasure, and great suffering in the next life.

**Verse 79**
> One should speak with trustworthy, well-placed words, with clear meaning, pleasant, delightful to hear, rooted in compassion, soft and gentle.⁵⁶

**Verse 80**
> One should always look at beings directly, as if drinking them in with the eyes.⁵⁷ "Depending on these alone, I shall attain buddhahood."

**Verse 81**
> Great good arises from continuous, devoted practice toward the antidote, toward the field of good qualities and kindness, and toward the suffering.⁵⁸

**Verse 82**
> One should be skillful, diligent, and always self-reliant.⁵⁹ No opportunity should be given to anyone in any work.

**Verse 83**
> The perfections—generosity and so forth—are progressively superior. One should not abandon a greater one for a lesser, except for the bridge of conduct.⁶⁰

**Verse 84**
> Having understood thus, one should always be engaged in others' welfare. Even what is forbidden is permitted for the compassionate one who sees the benefit.⁶¹

**Verse 85**
> One should eat in moderation, sharing with those who have fallen, the unprotected, and those observing vows. One should give away everything except the three robes.⁶²

**Verse 86**
> One should not harm the body that serves the true Dharma for trivial purposes. In this way alone one quickly fulfills the hopes of beings.

**Verse 87**
> Therefore one should not give up one's life while one's compassionate intention is impure. But if the intention is equal, one should give it up.⁶³ Thus there is no loss.

**Verse 88**
> One should not teach Dharma to one who is disrespectful, who is healthy but wears a head covering, who carries an umbrella, staff, or weapon, or whose head is veiled.⁶⁴

**Verse 89**
> One should not teach the profound and vast to those of lesser capacity. One should treat the lesser and the greater Dharmas with equal respect, without women, without a man.⁶⁵

**Verse 90**
> One should not assign someone who is a vessel for the vast Dharma to the lesser Dharma. One should not attract them by forsaking conduct through sūtras and mantras.⁶⁶

**Verse 91**
> The open ejection of toothsticks and phlegm is unwelcome.⁶⁷ Urinating and such in usable water or on the ground is reprehensible.

**Verse 92**
> One should not eat with a full mouth, noisily, or with mouth wide open. One should not sit with legs dangling, nor rub both arms together.⁶⁸

**Verse 93**
> One should not travel, sleep, or sit alone with another's woman. Having seen and inquired what displeases people, one should avoid it.⁶⁹

**Verse 94**
> One should not indicate anything with a finger,⁷⁰ but respectfully with the right hand. One should point out the way with the whole hand in that manner.

**Verse 95**
> One should not wave the arms about and make noise over a small matter. Snapping fingers and such should be done. Otherwise one is unrestrained.⁷¹

**Verse 96**
> One should lie down in the direction one wishes, like the Lord at nirvāṇa.⁷² Introspective, quick to rise—first, obligatorily, by vow.

---

## VII. Final Instructions

### Verses 97–109: Study and Practice

**Verse 97**
> The conduct of bodhisattvas is said to be immeasurable. One should certainly practice the conduct of purifying the mind.⁷³

**Verse 98**
> Three times by day and three times by night one should recite the Three Sections.⁷⁴ Through that, relying on bodhicitta and the Victors, remaining downfalls are pacified.

**Verse 99**
> Whatever situations one encounters, whether by oneself or under others' power, one should train diligently in the trainings that apply to those situations.⁷⁵

**Verse 100**
> There is nothing that should not be trained in by the children of the Victors. For one abiding thus, there is nothing that is not merit.⁷⁶

**Verse 101**
> Directly or indirectly, one should do nothing except for the welfare of beings. And for the sake of beings alone, one should dedicate everything to awakening.⁷⁷

**Verse 102**
> One should never abandon the spiritual friend, even for one's life—one who holds the bodhisattva vow, who is skilled in the meaning of the Mahāyāna.⁷⁸

**Verse 103**
> One should learn the service to the teacher from the Śrīsaṃbhava-vimokṣa.⁷⁹ This and other teachings of the Buddha are to be known from reading the sūtras.

**Verse 104**
> The trainings are to be seen in the sūtras; therefore one should recite the sūtras. One should examine the root downfalls in the Ākāśagarbha-sūtra.⁸⁰

**Verse 105**
> The Śikṣāsamuccaya must certainly be examined again and again,⁸¹ for daily conduct is extensively shown there.

**Verse 106**
> Or, at least for the time being, see the Sūtrasamuccaya. And with effort, see the second one composed by the noble Nāgārjuna.⁸²

**Verse 107**
> From that, seeing what is forbidden and what is enjoined, practice the training for the sake of protecting the mind of worldly beings.⁸³

**Verse 108**
> This alone is the definition of introspection in brief: the repeated examination of the state of body and mind.⁸⁴

**Verse 109**
> I shall read this with my body. What is the use of mere verbal reading? What benefit comes to the sick from merely reading about medicine?⁸⁵

# Chapter 6: The Perfection of Patience

## Kṣāntipāramitā — क्षान्तिपारमिता

*A Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel*

---

## I. The Destructive Power of Anger

### Verses 1–8: Anger Destroys Everything

**Verse 1**
> All this excellent conduct—generosity, worship of the Sugatas—performed over thousands of aeons, a single moment of hatred destroys.¹

**Verse 2**
> There is no evil equal to hatred, and no austerity equal to patience.² Therefore one should cultivate patience diligently, through various methods.

**Verse 3**
> The mind does not grasp peace, does not experience pleasure and happiness, does not find sleep or stability, when the thorn of hatred is lodged in the heart.³

**Verse 4**
> Even those whom one benefits with wealth and honors, who depend on one, wish to kill a lord who is miserable through hatred.

**Verse 5**
> Even friends shrink from him. He gives but is not served. In short, there is nothing by which the angry person is well-situated.

**Verse 6**
> Knowing thus that hatred creates such suffering—whoever destroys hatred steadfastly is happy here and hereafter.

**Verse 7**
> Having obtained the food of mental distress from the obstruction of what is desired and from the occurrence of what is not desired, hatred grows arrogant and destroys me.

**Verse 8**
> Therefore I shall destroy the food of that enemy. For that enemy has no other business than slaying me.

---

## II. The Logic of Acceptance

### Verses 9–21: Why Grief Is Pointless

**Verse 9**
> Even by the occurrence of the extremely undesirable, my cheerfulness should not be disturbed. Even in mental distress there is nothing wanted; and virtue deteriorates.

**Verse 10**
> If there is a remedy, what use is grief about it? And if there is no remedy, what use is grief about it?⁴

**Verse 11**
> Suffering, contempt, harsh words, disgrace—these are unwished for by us and our dear ones; for our enemies, the opposite.

**Verse 12**
> Happiness is obtained somehow with difficulty; suffering remains without effort. It is only through suffering that liberation is achieved. Therefore, mind, be steadfast!

**Verse 13**
> The devotees of Durgā⁵ and the people of Karṇāṭa endure the pain of burning and cutting pointlessly, for the sake of liberation. Why then am I timid?

**Verse 14**
> There is nothing that is difficult through practice. Therefore, through practice of mild discomfort, even great discomfort becomes bearable.

**Verse 15**
> Do you not see as meaningless the discomfort of biting gnats and flies, hunger and thirst, and great suffering such as itching?

**Verse 16**
> Cold, heat, rain, wind, illness, bondage, and blows—one should not be delicate about these. Otherwise discomfort increases.

**Verse 17**
> Some, seeing their own blood, become even more courageous. But others, seeing even another's blood, fall into a faint.

**Verse 18**
> This comes from firmness or timidity of mind. Therefore one should become unconquerable by suffering and should overcome discomfort.

**Verse 19**
> Even in suffering, the wise one should not disturb the serenity of the mind. For there is battle with the afflictions, and in battle discomfort is easily obtained.

**Verse 20**
> Those who, receiving the blows of enemies on their chests, conquer their enemies—they are the victorious heroes. The rest are merely corpse-slayers.

**Verse 21**
> Another merit of suffering is that through disenchantment, pride falls away, compassion arises for those in saṃsāra, fear of evil, and longing for the Victor.

---

## III. Understanding the Mechanics of Harm

### Verses 22–33: No One Is Truly to Blame

**Verse 22**
> I am not angry at bile and the rest, even though they are great causes of suffering. Why then be angry at sentient beings? They too are provoked by conditions.⁶

**Verse 23**
> Just as this pain arises unwished for, so too anger arises forcefully, though unwished for.

**Verse 24**
> A person does not become angry thinking "I shall become angry." And anger does not arise intending "I shall arise."

**Verse 25**
> Whatever offenses there are, and whatever various evils—all arise through the force of conditions. There is nothing that is independent.

**Verse 26**
> The collection of conditions does not have the thought "I shall produce." Nor does what is produced have the thought "I was produced."

**Verse 27**
> That which is called the "primal" and is desired as the self—even that does not arise thinking "I shall come into being."

**Verse 28**
> For what is not arisen does not exist. Who then would wish to come into being? And since it is occupied with objects, it does not even exert itself to cease.

**Verse 29**
> If the self is permanent and non-conscious, like space, it is clearly without action. Even in connection with other conditions, what action is there for what is unchanging?

**Verse 30**
> If at the time of action it is the same as before, what is done by it through action? If there is a connection of action to it, which one is the basis of that?

**Verse 31**
> Thus everything is dependent on another, and that upon which it depends is itself not independent. When beings are like magical creations without volition, at whom should one be angry?⁷

**Verse 32**
> If one objects: "Even so, warding off anger is not appropriate. For who wards off what?"—it is appropriate, since there is dependent origination and cessation of suffering is accepted.

**Verse 33**
> Therefore, seeing either enemy or friend acting wrongly, reflecting "Such are his conditions," one should be happy.⁸

---

## IV. The Futility of Beings' Wishes

### Verses 34–40: They Cannot Help Themselves

**Verse 34**
> If all embodied beings achieved their goals just by wishing, no one would have any suffering, for no one wishes to suffer.

**Verse 35**
> Through carelessness, people injure themselves with thorns and the like, through anger with fasting, and through desire for unattainable women.

**Verse 36**
> Some kill themselves by hanging, by throwing themselves off cliffs, by eating poison and unwholesome things, and by non-meritorious conduct.

**Verse 37**
> If, when overcome by afflictions, they kill even the beloved self, how could there be restraint toward the bodies of others?

**Verse 38**
> Toward those maddened by afflictions, engaged in killing themselves—not only is there no compassion, but anger arises. How?

**Verse 39**
> If it is the nature of fools to cause harm to others, anger toward them is not appropriate—just as toward fire, whose nature is to burn.

**Verse 40**
> And if this fault is adventitious and beings are by nature gentle, anger toward them is equally inappropriate—like anger at the sky for acrid smoke.

---

## V. Taking Responsibility

### Verses 41–51: I Brought This on Myself

**Verse 41**
> If, ignoring the main cause such as the stick, one is angry at the inciter, that one too is incited by hatred. Better that I be angry at hatred.

**Verse 42**
> In the past I too have caused such harm to sentient beings. Therefore it is right for me—who harm beings—to receive this.⁹

**Verse 43**
> Both his weapon and my body are causes of suffering. He took up the weapon; I took up the body. At which should I be angry?

**Verse 44**
> This body-boil, shaped like a person, taken by me, unable to bear touch—blinded by craving, at which should I be angry when it suffers?

**Verse 45**
> I do not wish for suffering, yet foolishly I wish for its cause. When suffering comes through my own fault, why be angry at another?

**Verse 46**
> Just as the sword-leaf forest, and just as the hell-birds—these are produced by my own karma. At what should I be angry?

**Verse 47**
> Impelled by my karma alone, those who harm me have arisen. By that they will go to hells. Have they not been slain by me?

**Verse 48**
> Relying on these, much of my sin is destroyed through patience. But relying on me, these go to hells of long suffering.

**Verse 49**
> I am the one who has harmed these beings, and these are my benefactors. Having reversed this, why do you, O wicked mind, become angry?¹⁰

**Verse 50**
> If there is merit in my intention, I shall not go to hells. If the self is protected by me, what comes to these from that?

**Verse 51**
> And if I were to retaliate, even so, these would not be protected. My conduct would be impaired, and thus these ascetics would be ruined.

---

## VI. What Harm Can Words Do?

### Verses 52–68: Analyzing the Nature of Harm

**Verse 52**
> Since the mind is formless, it cannot be harmed by anyone anywhere. But through attachment to the body, it is afflicted by bodily suffering.

**Verse 53**
> Contempt, harsh speech, disgrace—this group does not harm the body. Why then, mind, do you become angry?

**Verse 54**
> Will others' displeasure toward me devour me, either in this life or in another, that it is unwanted by me?

**Verse 55**
> If it is unwanted because it causes obstruction to gain—my gain will perish here; my sin will remain firmly.

**Verse 56**
> Better that death come to me today than a long life through wrong livelihood. For even after living long, there is still the suffering of death for me.

**Verse 57**
> One person, having enjoyed happiness for a hundred years in a dream, wakes up. Another, having been happy for a moment, wakes up.

**Verse 58**
> Surely happiness ceases for both who have awakened. It is just so at the time of death for one who lived long and one who lived briefly.

**Verse 59**
> Even after obtaining many gains and enjoying pleasures for a long time, I shall go empty-handed and naked, like one who was robbed.

**Verse 60**
> If through gain I live and destroy sin and do merit—is it not the case that one who is angry for the sake of gain destroys merit and does sin?

**Verse 61**
> If the very purpose for which I live perishes—what is the use of a life that only does evil?

**Verse 62**
> If one objects: "Hatred toward the one who speaks ill destroys beings"—why does your anger not arise also toward one who speaks ill of another?

**Verse 63**
> Your patience toward those who are displeased with another is explained by their dependence on conditions—but there is no patience toward one who speaks ill of you, who is dependent on the arising of afflictions.

**Verse 64**
> Toward those who destroy or slander images, stūpas, or the true Dharma, it is not appropriate for me to be angry, for the Buddhas and the rest are not harmed.

**Verse 65**
> Toward those who harm teachers, relatives, and dear ones, seeing that this arises from conditions as before, one should ward off anger.

**Verse 66**
> Harm to embodied beings is certainly made by both conscious and non-conscious causes. That harm is seen in the conscious one. Therefore be patient with this harm.

**Verse 67**
> Some offend through delusion; others, also deluded, become angry. Which of these do we call blameless? Which do we call blameworthy?

**Verse 68**
> Why did I act thus before, that I am now harmed by others in this way? All are dependent on karma. Who am I to alter this?

## VII. Working Toward Universal Friendliness

### Verses 69–75: The Path Forward

**Verse 69**
> Having understood this, I thus make effort toward merit, so that all will become friendly-minded toward each other.

**Verse 70**
> When a house is burning, and fire has gone from it to another house, one should remove and throw away the straw and such where it might spread.

**Verse 71**
> So too, when the mind is burned by the fire of hatred through attachment, at that moment one should abandon it, fearing the burning up of the body of merit.

**Verse 72**
> If one who is to be killed is cut free and released, what misfortune is that? If one is freed from human suffering and hells, what misfortune?

**Verse 73**
> If even this mere suffering today cannot be endured, why is anger—the cause of hell-suffering—not warded off?

**Verse 74**
> For the sake of anger, I have been tortured in hells thousands of times, having achieved neither my own purpose nor the purpose of others.

**Verse 75**
> But this is not such suffering, and it will accomplish a great purpose. Here, suffering that removes the suffering of the world should bring only joy.

---

## VIII. Rejoicing in Others' Good Fortune

### Verses 76–89: Overcoming Jealousy

**Verse 76**
> If others have obtained pleasure and happiness through praising one rich in virtues, mind, you too, praising him—why do you not rejoice thus?

**Verse 77**
> This joy-happiness of yours is blameless, a source of happiness, not prohibited by the virtuous—the best way of winning over others.

**Verse 78**
> If you object: "This is his happiness alone"—then if this is not pleasing to you, both visible and invisible results are destroyed by ceasing to pay wages and such.

**Verse 79**
> When your own virtue is being proclaimed, you want others' happiness too. When another's virtue is being proclaimed, you do not want even your own happiness.

**Verse 80**
> Having generated bodhicitta out of desire for the happiness of all beings, why do you now become angry at beings who have obtained happiness by themselves?

**Verse 81**
> Do you not wish buddhahood—which is worshipped by the three worlds—for beings? Why are you burned seeing their transitory honor?

**Verse 82**
> One who nourishes him whom you should nourish—he gives to you yourself. Having found one who supports his family, you do not rejoice but become angry.

**Verse 83**
> For one who wishes awakening for beings, does he not wish this? Where is the bodhicitta of one who is angry at another's prosperity?

**Verse 84**
> If it was not received by him, it remains in the benefactor's house. In any case it is not yours. What does it matter to you whether it is given or not given?

**Verse 85**
> Should he obstruct his merit, his admirers, his own virtues? Should he, when receiving, not accept? Tell me, at whom are you not angry?

**Verse 86**
> Not only do you not grieve for yourself who have done evil, but you want to compete with those who have done merit.

**Verse 87**
> If something unpleasant has arisen for your enemy, what will come of your satisfaction? Your mere wish will not become a cause without that.

**Verse 88**
> And if it were accomplished by your wish—what happiness is there in his suffering for you? Even if there were purpose, what misfortune could be greater than this?

**Verse 89**
> For this is the terrible hook cast by the fishermen of afflictions—from which, having purchased you, the hell-guardians will cook you in pots.

---

## IX. The Worthlessness of Praise and Blame

### Verses 90–101: Fame Is Nothing

**Verse 90**
> Praise, fame, and honor are not for merit, not for longevity, not for strength, not for health, not for bodily comfort to me.

**Verse 91**
> This much would be one's own purpose for a wise person who knows his own purpose. Should gambling and drinking be resorted to by one who wishes mental happiness?

**Verse 92**
> For the sake of fame, some give away wealth and even kill themselves. What can syllables be eaten? And when one is dead, whose is that happiness?

**Verse 93**
> Just as a child cries distressfully when his sand castle is broken, so does my mind appear to me when praise and fame are lost.

**Verse 94**
> A word, lacking consciousness—it is impossible that it praises me. "Another is pleased in me"—if this is the cause of my joy—

**Verse 95**
> —what is the use to me of another's joy, whether in me or in another? The pleasure-happiness is his alone. Not even a small portion of it is mine.

**Verse 96**
> If my happiness is through his happiness, this should be so always everywhere. Why is there no happiness for me when others are happy through the favor of another?

**Verse 97**
> Therefore, the joy that arises in me thinking "I am praised"—even that, being unconnected, is merely childish behavior.

**Verse 98**
> Praise and the rest disturb my equanimity, destroy my disenchantment, create jealousy toward the virtuous, and anger at success.

**Verse 99**
> Therefore, those who are present for the destruction of my praise and the rest—are they not engaged in protecting me from falling to lower realms?

**Verse 100**
> It is inappropriate for me, who seeks liberation, to be bound by gain and honor. Those who free me from bondage—how can I be angry at them?

**Verse 101**
> For one who wishes to enter suffering, those who have become like a door—as if by the Buddha's blessing—how can I be angry at them?

---

## X. The Preciousness of Enemies

### Verses 102–111: Enemies as Teachers

**Verse 102**
> If one objects: "He has created an obstacle to merit"—anger is not appropriate here. There is no austerity equal to patience—surely this has arrived.

**Verse 103**
> And if through my own fault I do not practice patience here, then the obstacle to merit has been created by me alone, when the cause was present.

**Verse 104**
> That without which something does not exist and on the existence of which it exists—that is indeed its cause. How is it called an obstacle?

**Verse 105**
> An obstacle to generosity is not made by a suppliant who appeared at the proper time. And when one seeking ordination arrives, it is not called an obstacle to ordination.

**Verse 106**
> Those who beg are easily found in the world, but those who harm are difficult to find. For if I have not offended, no one will offend me.¹¹

**Verse 107**
> Therefore, the enemy, having arisen in my house like a treasure acquired without effort, should be cherished by me as a helper in the bodhisattva conduct.¹²

**Verse 108**
> The fruit of patience is obtained by me and by him. Therefore, to him first should it be given, for patience came first from him.

**Verse 109**
> If one objects: "He has no intention of accomplishing patience, therefore the enemy is not to be honored"—then why is the true Dharma honored, though it is a suitable cause of accomplishment?

**Verse 110**
> If one objects: "The enemy is not to be honored because his intention is to harm"—how else would I have patience, as toward a physician intent on benefit?

**Verse 111**
> It is precisely in dependence on his hostile intention that patience arises. Therefore he is the cause of patience and should be honored by me like the true Dharma.

---

## XI. The Field of Beings

### Verses 112–123: Beings Equal Buddhas

**Verse 112**
> Therefore the Sage said that the field of beings and the field of the Victors are alike. For many have gone to the far shore of attainment by pleasing them.¹³

**Verse 113**
> When the acquisition of Buddha-qualities from beings and from Victors is equal, what logic is there in not treating beings with the same respect as Victors?

**Verse 114**
> The greatness of intention is not from itself but from its effect. Therefore the greatness of beings is equal, and thus they are equal.

**Verse 115**
> The friendliness of intention is what is worthy of honor—that is the greatness of beings. And the merit from pleasing the Buddha—that is the greatness of the Buddha.

**Verse 116**
> Therefore beings are equal to Victors in the portion of contributing to Buddha-qualities. But none are equal to Buddhas, who are oceans of virtue with infinite portions.

**Verse 117**
> If even a particle of virtue were seen anywhere in those who are a unique collection of the essence of virtues, even the three worlds would not be sufficient for its worship.

**Verse 118**
> But in beings there exists the best portion of giving rise to Buddha-qualities. In proportion to that portion, worship of beings should be made.

**Verse 119**
> Moreover, for genuine kinsmen of immeasurable benefit, what other repayment could there be than pleasing beings?

**Verse 120**
> For their sake bodies are torn apart and one enters Avīci—when that is done for them, that is done. Therefore one should do only good toward these, even though they are great offenders.

**Verse 121**
> My lords themselves, for their own sake, are unconcerned even for their own selves. How can I act with pride toward these lords and not with servitude?

**Verse 122**
> From the happiness of beings comes the joy of the Lords of Sages; at their suffering they enter into anger. From pleasing them comes the delight of all the Lords of Sages; harm to them is harm to the Sages.

**Verse 123**
> Just as there is no mental happiness for one whose body is completely on fire, even with all pleasures—so too, for those who are made of compassion, there is no means of joy when beings suffer.

---

## XII. Final Confession and Vow

### Verses 124–134: The Supreme Practice

**Verse 124**
> Therefore, whatever suffering I have caused to all the greatly compassionate ones by harming beings—today I confess that sin. May the Sages forgive that which has distressed them.

**Verse 125**
> In order to please the Tathāgatas, today I enter into servitude to the world with my entire self. Let the multitudes of beings place their feet on my head or strike me. May the Lord of the World be pleased.

**Verse 126**
> That the compassionate ones have made this entire world their own—of this there is no doubt. Those who are seen in the form of beings—they themselves are the Protectors. Why this disrespect here?

**Verse 127**
> This is the way to please the Tathāgatas. This is the way to accomplish one's own welfare. This is the way to remove the suffering of the world. Therefore let this be my vow.¹⁴

**Verse 128**
> Just as a single king's officer overpowers a great people, the great people are unable to resist—for they are far-seeing.

**Verse 129**
> For he is not alone; his power is the king's power. So too, one should not despise any offender who is weak.

**Verse 130**
> For the hell-guardians and the compassionate ones are his power. Therefore one should please beings, as a servant pleases a fierce king.

**Verse 131**
> What could an angered king do that would equal the hell-suffering experienced through making beings unhappy?

**Verse 132**
> What could a pleased king give that would equal buddhahood, experienced through making beings happy?

**Verse 133**
> Setting aside the future buddhahood that arises from pleasing beings—do you not see even here the good fortune, fame, and well-being?

**Verse 134**
> A charming appearance, health, joy, long life, the vast happiness of a cakravartin—the patient one attains all these while wandering in saṃsāra.¹⁵

# Chapter 7: The Perfection of Heroic Effort

## Vīryapāramitā — वीर्यपारमिता

*A Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel*

---

## I. The Foundation of All Merit

### Verses 1–2: Definition and Adversaries

**Verse 1**
> Thus, having patient forbearance, one should cultivate heroic effort,¹ for awakening is established in effort. Without effort there is no merit—just as without wind there is no movement.

**Verse 2**
> What is heroic effort? Enthusiasm for the wholesome.² Its adversary is called: laziness, attachment to the contemptible, discouragement, and self-deprecation.³

---

## II. The Nature of Laziness

### Verses 3–15: How Laziness Arises

**Verse 3**
> Through relishing the pleasure of inactivity, through craving for sleep and reliance on it, through lack of distress at the sufferings of saṃsāra—laziness arises.

**Verse 4**
> Caught by the afflictions' huntsmen, you have entered the hunter's net of births. Do you still not know today that you have entered the mouth of death?⁴

**Verse 5**
> Do you not see that those of your own kind are being slaughtered one by one? Yet you go to sleep like a buffalo before the butcher.⁵

**Verse 6**
> When Yama is watching you, when your path is blocked on all sides—how can eating please you? How can sleep? How can pleasure?

**Verse 7**
> When death comes quickly, while your provisions are still being gathered, even if you abandon laziness then—what will you do when it is too late?

**Verse 8**
> "This I have not obtained, this I have begun, this remains half-done—and suddenly death has arrived! Alas, I am slain!"—thinking thus...

**Verse 9**
> ...seeing your relatives in despair, faces tear-stained and red-eyed with the swell of grief, seeing the faces of Yama's messengers...

**Verse 10**
> ...tormented by memories of your own sins, hearing the sounds of the hells, your body smeared with filth from terror—what will you do in your confusion?

**Verse 11**
> "I am like a live fish"—if such fear is appropriate even now, how much more so for one who has done evil, facing the intense sufferings of the hells?

**Verse 12**
> O delicate one, you burn when touched even by hot water. Having done deeds that lead to hell, how do you sit so calmly?

**Verse 13**
> You who want results without effort, delicate one, much-afflicted one, seized by death yet acting as if immortal—O suffering one, you are being destroyed!

**Verse 14**
> Having obtained this human vessel, cross the great river of suffering. O fool, this is not the time for sleep—this boat is difficult to find again!⁶

**Verse 15**
> Abandoning the supreme joy of the Dharma—an unending stream of happiness—how can you take pleasure in frivolity and laughter, which are causes of suffering?

---

## III. The Causes of Effort

### Verses 16–30: Dispelling Despair

**Verse 16**
> Non-discouragement, the army of strength, application, self-mastery,⁷ equalizing self and other,⁸ and exchanging self and other.

**Verse 17**
> One should not be discouraged thinking "How could awakening be for me?" For the Tathāgata, the truth-speaker, spoke this truth:

**Verse 18**
> "Even gnats, flies, mosquitoes, and worms have attained that supreme awakening so difficult to reach, through the power of their enthusiasm."⁹

**Verse 19**
> How much more so I, born human, able to discern benefit from harm? Not abandoning the way of the Omniscient Ones, why should I not attain awakening?

**Verse 20**
> If I have fear thinking "Hands and feet and such must be given"—that would be my confusion about what is heavy and what is light, from lack of investigation.

**Verse 21**
> For innumerable aeons, countless beyond reckoning, I have been cut, torn, burned, and split—yet awakening did not arise.

**Verse 22**
> But this limited suffering of mine accomplishes complete awakening—like the pain of removing a splinter, for the relief it brings.¹⁰

**Verse 23**
> All physicians produce health through painful procedures. Therefore, to destroy many sufferings, a little must be endured.

**Verse 24**
> But the Supreme Physician has not even given this conventional treatment. He heals the gravely ill through the gentlest of methods.

**Verse 25**
> At first, the Guide prescribes the giving of vegetables and such. Later, gradually, one comes to give even one's own flesh.

**Verse 26**
> When insight arises toward one's own flesh as toward vegetables, then what is difficult about giving up flesh and bone?

**Verse 27**
> One is not unhappy from having abandoned sin; one is not sad from being wise. For suffering comes to the mind from false conception, and to the body from sin.

**Verse 28**
> The body is happy through merit; the mind is happy through wisdom. Dwelling in saṃsāra for the sake of others, why should the compassionate one be afflicted?

**Verse 29**
> Destroying former sins, receiving oceans of merit—through the power of bodhicitta alone, one is swifter than the Śrāvakas.

**Verse 30**
> Thus going from happiness to happiness—who with sense would be discouraged? Having obtained the chariot of bodhicitta, which removes all weariness and toil?

---

## IV. The Four Powers

### Verses 31–46: Aspiration, Steadfastness, Delight, and Releasing

**Verse 31**
> The powers of aspiration, steadfastness, delight, and releasing¹¹ are for accomplishing the welfare of beings. One should generate aspiration through fear of suffering and by contemplating benefits.

**Verse 32**
> Thus, having uprooted the adversary, one should strive for increase of enthusiasm through the powers of aspiration, pride, delight, releasing, application, and self-mastery.

**Verse 33**
> I must destroy immeasurable faults, my own and others'. But the destruction of each single fault would take oceans of aeons.

**Verse 34**
> If I do not see even the slightest beginning of destroying faults, and I am the vessel for immeasurable suffering—why does my heart not burst?

**Verse 35**
> I must develop many qualities, my own and others'. But the practice of each single quality might not occur even in oceans of aeons.

**Verse 36**
> I have never developed even a fraction of these qualities. Wondrous though it is to have obtained this birth, I have wasted it in vain.

**Verse 37**
> I have not attained the happiness of the great festival of worship of the Blessed One. I have not served the Teaching. I have not fulfilled the hopes of the poor.

**Verse 38**
> I have not given fearlessness to the fearful. I have not made the afflicted happy. I have become only a spike in my mother's womb, destined for suffering.¹²

**Verse 39**
> From the loss of my wish for the Dharma in former lives, now this disaster has arisen for me. Who would relinquish the wish for the Dharma?

**Verse 40**
> The Sage declared that aspiration is the root of all wholesome things. And its root is the constant contemplation of the ripening of results.

---

## V. The Ripening of Actions

### Verses 41–45: Karma and Its Fruits

**Verse 41**
> Suffering, mental distress, and various fears, and the obstruction of desires—these arise for those who do evil.

**Verse 42**
> Wherever the wish of those who do good goes, there, by those very merits, they are honored with the reward of their results.

**Verse 43**
> But wherever the wish of the evildoer goes, there, by those very sins, they are struck down with the weapons of suffering.

**Verse 44**
> Through virtue, as children of the Sugata, they come before the Sugata—dwelling in the wombs of vast, cool lotuses fragrant and sweet, their radiance increased by nourishment from the Victor's sweet voice, their beautiful bodies emerging from lotuses opened by the sage's rays.

**Verse 45**
> Through evil, crying out in pain as Yama's minions strip all skin, their bodies doused with molten copper heated by fire, their flesh cut into hundreds of pieces by the blows of blazing swords and lances—one falls repeatedly onto the ground of burning iron.

**Verse 46**
> Therefore aspiration for the wholesome should be generated, contemplating this with care. Beginning with the method of Vajradhvaja,¹³ one should cultivate pride.

---

## VI. The Three Kinds of Self-Confidence

### Verses 47–59: Pride of Work, Pride of Capacity, Pride of Afflictions

**Verse 47**
> First examining one's capacity, one should undertake or not undertake. Not undertaking is better than undertaking only to turn back.

**Verse 48**
> In another life too, this habit continues; sin and suffering increase. And another task and its time are lost—and even that task is not accomplished.

**Verse 49**
> Self-confidence should be applied to three things: action, defilements, and capacity.¹⁴ "I alone must do this"—this is the self-confidence regarding action.

**Verse 50**
> This world, under the power of afflictions, is unable to accomplish its own welfare. Therefore I must do it for them, for I am not incapable like ordinary people.

**Verse 51**
> When another is doing lowly work, should I just stand by? If I do not do it out of pride, better that my pride perish.

**Verse 52**
> Even a crow acts like a Garuḍa when it finds a dead snake.¹⁵ If my mind is weak, even a small onslaught will harm me.

**Verse 53**
> When one stops trying, given to discouragement, misfortunes easily prevail. But one who rises up and strives is hard to conquer even by the great.

**Verse 54**
> Therefore, with a firm mind, I shall overcome misfortune through misfortune.¹⁶ For one who wishes to conquer the three worlds, defeat by me is laughable.

**Verse 55**
> I must conquer all; I shall be conquered by none. I shall bear this pride, for I am the offspring of the Lion of Victors.¹⁷

**Verse 56**
> Those beings conquered by pride are wretched—they are not proud. The proud one does not come under the power of the enemy; but those are under the power of the enemy pride.

**Verse 57**
> Led by pride to the lower realms, even as humans they have lost all joy—eating others' leavings, as slaves, foolish, ugly, and emaciated.

**Verse 58**
> Everywhere despised, those ascetics stiff with pride—if they too are counted among the proud, then tell me, what is pitiable?

**Verse 59**
> Those are the proud and victorious, those are the heroes, who bear pride for the sake of conquering the enemy pride—who, having slain that quivering enemy pride, freely grant the fruit of victory to beings.¹⁸

---

## VII. Application and Joy

### Verses 60–75: Delight in Work

**Verse 60**
> Stationed amid the host of afflictions, one should be defiant a thousandfold—unconquerable by the hosts of afflictions, like a lion among herds of deer.

**Verse 61**
> Even in great difficulties, the eye does not see taste. So too, even when meeting difficulty, one should not come under the power of afflictions.

**Verse 62**
> One should be addicted to whatever task one is undertaking, intoxicated by that task, insatiable—like one who wants the fruit-pleasure of play.

**Verse 63**
> Work is done for the sake of happiness, yet whether happiness comes or not is uncertain. But for one whose happiness is in the work itself—how can one be happy without work?¹⁹

**Verse 64**
> In saṃsāra there is no satisfaction in sensual pleasures, which are like honey on a razor's edge. How could there be satisfaction in the nectar of merit, whose ripening is sweet and blissful?

**Verse 65**
> Therefore, even at the end of a task, one should plunge into another task, just as an elephant scorched by the midday sun, upon finding a lake, plunges in.

**Verse 66**
> But when strength declines, one should release to continue later. When well completed, one should release with thirst for what comes next.

**Verse 67**
> One should guard against the blows of the afflictions and strike firmly at the afflictions—like one engaged in sword-battle with a trained enemy.

**Verse 68**
> Just as one would quickly and fearfully seize a dropped sword, so should one seize the dropped sword of mindfulness, remembering the hells.

**Verse 69**
> Just as poison reaching the blood spreads through the body, so when a fault finds an opening, it spreads through the mind.

**Verse 70**
> Like an oil-bearer watched by sword-bearers, who in fear of death if he stumbles is completely focused on the oil—so too should the practitioner be focused.

**Verse 71**
> Therefore, just as one quickly rises when a snake comes into one's lap, so when the approach of sleep and laziness comes, one should quickly counter them.

**Verse 72**
> At each misstep, one should be thoroughly remorseful and reflect: "How shall I act so that this does not happen to me again?"

**Verse 73**
> One should seek association or activity for this reason, thinking: "How may the practice of mindfulness come about in these circumstances?"

**Verse 74**
> One should make oneself light, remembering the instruction on heedfulness,²⁰ so that before the approach of action, one is ready for everything.

**Verse 75**
> Just as cotton goes wherever the wind takes it, coming or going—so one should go where enthusiasm takes one, and thus success is achieved.²¹

# Chapter 8: The Perfection of Meditation

## Dhyānapāramitā — ध्यानपारमिता

*A Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel*

---

## I. The Foundation of Meditation

### Verses 1–4: Why Solitude Is Needed

**Verse 1**
> Having thus increased effort, one should establish the mind in meditation. For a person with a distracted mind dwells between the fangs of afflictions.¹

**Verse 2**
> Through the seclusion of body and mind, distraction does not arise. Therefore, abandoning the world, one should abandon discursive thoughts.

**Verse 3**
> Through attachment the world is not abandoned, and through craving for gain and such. Therefore, to abandon these, the wise one should reflect thus:

**Verse 4**
> Knowing that through tranquility well-endowed with insight the afflictions are destroyed, tranquility should be sought first. And that arises through being free from concern about the world, through delight in detachment.²

---

## II. Abandoning Worldly Attachments

### Verses 5–15: The Problem with Others

**Verse 5**
> Who among impermanent beings should have affection for impermanent things? For thousands of births one will not see the beloved again.

**Verse 6**
> Without seeing, one does not attain joy, and does not remain in concentration. Even seeing, one is not satisfied—as before, one is afflicted by craving.

**Verse 7**
> One does not see things as they are; one falls from disenchantment. One is burned by that grief, by the desire to meet the beloved.

**Verse 8**
> By thinking of that, one's short life goes by in vain, again and again. By a transient friend, the eternal Dharma is ruined.

**Verse 9**
> Behaving in common with fools, one surely goes to lower rebirths. And being led to what is unwholesome—what is gained from the company of fools?

**Verse 10**
> In an instant they become friends; in an instant they become enemies. They become angry at what ought to please. Ordinary people are difficult to satisfy.

**Verse 11**
> When told something beneficial, they become angry and prevent me from the beneficial. If they are not listened to, they become angry and go to lower rebirths.

**Verse 12**
> Jealous of the superior, competitive with equals, arrogant toward the inferior, puffed up by praise, angry at criticism—when is there benefit from the fool?

**Verse 13**
> From fool to fool there inevitably arises some unwholesomeness: self-praise, disparagement of others, conversation about the pleasures of saṃsāra.

**Verse 14**
> Thus from that association with that one comes a meeting with misfortune. I shall dwell alone, happy, with an unafflicted mind.

**Verse 15**
> One should flee far from the fool; having met them, one should please them with kind words—not through the intimacy of familiarity, but being indifferent, like a virtuous person.³

---

## III. The Joy of Solitude

### Verses 16–39: Dwelling in the Forest

**Verse 16**
> Taking only dharma-essence, like a bee taking honey from flowers, I shall dwell everywhere unknown, as if new.

**Verse 17**
> "I am a gainer, I am honored, many want me"—such pride of the mortal leads to fear at the approach of death.

**Verse 18**
> Wherever the mind deluded by pleasure goes, there that pleasure-multiplied-a-thousandfold-into-suffering stands before it.

**Verse 19**
> Therefore the wise one should not desire that. From desire fear arises. This passes by itself—having made firmness, one should wait.

**Verse 20**
> Many gained wealth, many gained fame—but where did they go, together with their wealth and fame? No one knows.

**Verse 21**
> Others despise me—why should I rejoice when praised? Others praise me—why should I be sad when criticized?

**Verse 22**
> Beings of various inclinations are not satisfied even by the Jinas. How much less by an ignorant person like me! So why think about worldly people?

**Verse 23**
> They revile one without gain; they disparage one with gain. When those are painful to associate with by nature, how can delight arise from them?

**Verse 24**
> "The fool is no one's friend"—so the Tathāgatas have said. For the fool's affection arises only from self-interest.

**Verse 25**
> What affection arises through self-interest is affection for self-interest. Just as there is agitation when property is lost—that is from the loss of happiness it brought.

**Verse 26**
> Trees do not blame, and they need not be pleased with effort. When might I dwell together with those happy companions?

**Verse 27**
> Dwelling in an empty temple, at the foot of a tree, or in caves—when shall I go without looking back, without concern?

**Verse 28**
> Dwelling in places naturally vast and unclaimed, freely wandering—when shall I dwell unattached?

**Verse 29**
> With just an earthen bowl for wealth, with robes unattractive to thieves—when shall I dwell fearless, not guarding the body?

**Verse 30**
> Going to my own charnel ground, when shall I compare my own body with other skeletons—subject to decay as it is?

**Verse 31**
> For this body of mine will become so putrid that even jackals will not approach it because of the smell.

**Verse 32**
> The bone-pieces arising together with this single body will become separate. How much more so other beloved people.

**Verse 33**
> Alone one is born; alone one dies. This share of suffering cannot be taken by another. What use are obstructing loved ones?

**Verse 34**
> Just as one on a journey takes up a dwelling-place, so one journeying through existence takes up the dwelling-place of a birth.

**Verse 35**
> Until this body is carried out by four people, while the world still grieves—just so long should one go to the forest.

**Verse 36**
> Without intimacy and hostility, this body is already dead to the world. When dying, one does not grieve.

**Verse 37**
> And no one near causes distress by grieving. And no one disturbs the recollection of the Buddha and such.

**Verse 38**
> Therefore solitude is delightful, free from distress, source of well-being, calming all distractions—always to be cultivated by me.

**Verse 39**
> Released from all other thoughts, with a mind single-pointedly focused on my own mind, I shall strive for concentration and for taming the mind.⁴

---

## IV. Contempt for Sensual Pleasure

### Verses 40–85: The Foulness Contemplation

**Verse 40**
> For sensual pleasures produce misfortune, in this world and the next: here through bondage, killing, and cutting; hereafter through hell and such.

*[Verses 41–84 continue the extensive foulness contemplation (aśubha-bhāvanā), examining the impurity of the body and the delusion of attraction. Key themes include:]*

- **Verses 44–56**: The body is like a machine of impurities—bones bound by sinews, covered with flesh and skin
- **Verses 57–68**: The beloved object of desire is merely filth adorned
- **Verses 69–78**: Sensual attachment leads to immense suffering, slavery, and violence
- **Verses 79–84**: Even a fraction of the effort spent on sense pleasures would achieve awakening

**Verse 85**
> Thus recoiling from sensual pleasures, one should generate delight in solitude, in peaceful forest lands empty of conflict and strife.

---

## V. The Delight of the Forest

### Verses 86–89: Blissful Seclusion

**Verse 86**
> Happy ones walk on broad rock terraces of palaces pleasant with moonbeam-sandalwood coolness, fanned by the silent, gentle forest breeze—contemplating for the benefit of others.⁵

**Verse 87**
> Dwelling for as long as desired in empty places, at the foot of a tree, in caves—freed from the weariness of guarding possessions—one wanders as one wishes, without concern.

**Verse 88**
> Dwelling where one wishes, free, attached to no one—one enjoys such happiness of contentment as even Indra would find difficult to obtain.

**Verse 89**
> Thus, through such aspects, cultivating the virtues of solitude, with discursive thoughts calmed, one should cultivate bodhicitta.

---

## VI. Equality of Self and Other

### Verses 90–119: Parātmasamatā

**Verse 90**
> First, one should thus carefully cultivate the equality of self and other: all are equal in suffering and happiness—they should be protected by me as if they were myself.⁶

**Verse 91**
> Just as the body, with its many parts such as hands, is to be protected as a single thing—so too this world, though differentiated, is the same in suffering and happiness.

**Verse 92**
> Even though my suffering does not affect other bodies, it is still suffering that is unbearable to me because of attachment to self.

**Verse 93**
> So too, even though another's suffering is not experienced by me in myself, it is still suffering unbearable to him because of attachment to self.

**Verse 94**
> Another's suffering is to be removed by me, for it is suffering, like my own suffering. Others are to be benefited by me, for they are sentient beings, like my own being.

**Verse 95**
> When happiness is equally dear to me and to others, what is special about me that I strive for happiness for myself alone?

**Verse 96**
> When fear and suffering are equally unwanted by me and by others, what is special about me that I protect myself and not others?

**Verse 97**
> If I do not protect them because their suffering does not harm me—the suffering of the future body does not harm me either. Why then is that protected?

**Verse 98**
> "I shall be that very one then"—this conception is false. For it is one who dies and entirely another who is born.

**Verse 99**
> If whatever suffering someone has is to be protected by that very one, foot-suffering is not the hand's—why then is that protected by it?

**Verse 100**
> If this is inappropriate but proceeds from grasping an "I"—what is inappropriate for oneself and for another is to be abandoned as far as possible.

**Verse 101**
> A continuum and a group are false, like a row and an army. There is no one whose suffering it is. Therefore, whose is it to be called "one's own"?

**Verse 102**
> All sufferings equally are without owner. They are to be warded off simply because they are suffering. What use is a restriction here?

**Verse 103**
> Why should suffering be warded off? Because it is agreed by all without dispute. If it is to be warded off, then all of it equally. If not, then for me as for another.⁷

---

## VII. Exchanging Self and Other

### Verses 120–154: Parātmaparivartana

**Verse 120**
> One who wishes to quickly rescue self and other should practice that supreme secret: the exchange of self and other.⁸

**Verse 121**
> Because of excessive love for the self, there is fear even from a small danger. Who would not hate that self like an enemy, which causes fear?

**Verse 122**
> One who, thinking to cure illness such as hunger and thirst, kills birds, fish, and deer, and lies in wait on the road—

**Verse 123**
> —one who for the sake of gain and honor would kill even parents, would steal the Three Jewels' property, and would become fuel for Avīci—

**Verse 124**
> —what wise person would desire, protect, or honor that self? Who would not see it as an enemy? Who would respect it?

*[Verses 125–154 continue the exchange practice, including:]*

- **Verses 129–133**: All suffering arises from desiring one's own happiness; all happiness from desiring others' happiness
- **Verses 134–139**: The self must be given to others; others must be taken as self
- **Verses 140–154**: Detailed meditation on viewing oneself from another's perspective, applying jealousy, envy, and contempt to the self

---

## VIII. Conclusion: Mastering the Mind

### Verses 155–186: The Final Taming

**Verse 155**
> Countless aeons have passed while you sought your own welfare. By that great effort you have gained only suffering.

**Verse 156**
> By my instruction, engage thus without hesitation. Later you will see its benefits, for the Sage's word is true.

*[Verses 157–172 address the self directly, commanding it to serve others]*

**Verse 173**
> If you have affection for the self, do not take pleasure in the self. If the self is to be protected, this one should not be protected.

**Verse 174**
> The more this body is protected, the more delicate it becomes, and just so the more it falls.

**Verse 175**
> When it has thus fallen, even the whole earth is unable to fulfill its wishes. Then who will fulfill its wish?

**Verse 176**
> For one who wishes what cannot be had, affliction and disappointed hope arise. For one who is without hope in all things, prosperity never decays.

**Verse 177**
> Therefore, no scope should be given for the body's wish-increase. That is the good thing: what is not grasped as desirable is not taken.

**Verse 178**
> This ending in ashes, inert, moved by another—this horrible impure image—why do I grasp it?

**Verse 179**
> What use to me is this machine, living or dead? How is it different from a clod of dirt? Alas, why does my "I"-grasping not perish?

**Verse 184**
> Therefore I have given up this body for the welfare of the world. Though it has many faults, it is maintained as an instrument of action.

**Verse 185**
> So, enough of worldly conduct! Following the wise, remembering the instruction on heedfulness, I shall ward off drowsiness and dullness.

**Verse 186**
> Therefore, to destroy the obscurations, I shall practice concentration, drawing the mind back from wrong paths, constantly on its own support.⁹

# Chapter 9: The Perfection of Wisdom

## Prajñāpāramitā — प्रज्ञापारमिता

*A Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel*

---

## I. The Purpose of Wisdom

### Verses 1–10: Why Wisdom Is Needed

**Verse 1**
> All this preparation the Sage declared for the sake of wisdom.¹ Therefore, one who wishes to end suffering should generate wisdom.

**Verse 2**
> Two truths are held to exist: conventional and ultimate.² Reality is beyond the scope of intellect. Intellect is called conventional.

**Verse 3**
> With respect to this, the world is seen as twofold: the yogin and the ordinary. With respect to this, the ordinary world is refuted by the world of yogins.

**Verse 4**
> And yogins are refuted by successively higher ones, through distinctions of intelligence—for the purpose of an outcome accepted by both, without analysis.

**Verse 5**
> By the world, things are seen and conceived as real—not as illusion-like. Here there is disagreement between yogins and the world.

**Verse 6**
> Even direct perception of form and such is by convention, not by valid cognition—that convention is false, like the convention of purity regarding impure things.

**Verse 7**
> And for the purpose of leading the world, things are taught by the Protector. In reality they are momentary—if this contradicts convention, so be it.

**Verse 8**
> There is no fault for the yogin by way of convention. For truth-seers see differently from the world. Otherwise there would be worldly refutation of the perception of women as impure.³

---

## II. Refuting the Truly Existent Self

### Verses 56–78: Analysis of the Self

**Verse 57**
> If there is fear from that thing which produces suffering, let there be fear! Emptiness is the calmer of suffering—from that why should fear arise?

**Verse 58**
> If there is any self, let there be fear from that! But I am not anything at all. If "I" am nothing, fear of whom will there be?

**Verse 59**
> I am not teeth, hair, or nails. I am not bones, nor am I blood. I am not mucus, nor phlegm, nor pus, nor lymph.

**Verse 60**
> I am not fat, nor sweat, nor marrow, nor entrails. I am not the visceral cavity. I am not feces and urine.

**Verse 61**
> I am not flesh, nor sinews. I am not warmth nor wind. I am not the orifices, nor am I the six consciousnesses in any way.

*[Verses 62–75 continue the analysis of consciousness, refuting Sāṃkhya and other views]*

**Verse 76**
> "If there is no being, toward whom is compassion?" Toward that which is projected for the purpose of outcomes, through the delusion assumed.

**Verse 77**
> "Whose is the outcome if there is no being?" True, the effort is from delusion. But for the cessation of suffering, the delusion of the outcome is not prevented.

**Verse 78**
> But the delusion of the self, the cause of suffering, increases from the delusion of an "I." If that too is not to be stopped, better is the meditation on selflessness.

---

## III. Analysis of the Body

### Verses 79–88: The Body Is Empty

**Verse 79**
> The body is not the feet, nor the calves. The body is not the thighs, nor the hip. The body is not the belly, nor is it the back. The body is not the chest, nor the arms.

**Verse 80**
> It is not the hands, nor the sides, nor the armpits, nor characterized by the shoulders. It is not the neck, nor the head. Then what is the body here?

**Verse 84**
> Therefore there is no body. But from delusion there is the idea of a body in the hands and such, due to a particular arrangement—like the idea of a person in a post.⁴

**Verse 88**
> Thus, when form is like a dream, who is attached upon investigation? And when the body does not exist thus, then who is a woman and who is a man?

---

## IV. Analysis of Suffering and Mind

### Verses 89–104: Nothing Has True Existence

**Verse 89**
> If suffering truly exists, why does it not afflict the happy? If delicacies are truly pleasant suffering, why are they not enjoyed by the grief-stricken?

**Verse 99**
> When there is no experiencer at all and feeling also does not exist, then, having seen this situation, O craving, why are you not destroyed?

**Verse 102**
> There is no experiencer at all. Therefore feeling does not exist in reality. In this selfless aggregate, who exactly is afflicted by it?

**Verse 103**
> The mind is not located in the sense organs, not in form and such, not in between. And the mind is not found within or without, nor is it found elsewhere.

**Verse 104**
> That which is not in the body nor elsewhere, not mixed nor separate anywhere—that is nothing at all. Therefore beings are by nature beyond sorrow.⁵

---

## V. Refutation of Philosophical Views

### Verses 117–150: Against Theism, Sāṃkhya, and Reificationism

**Verse 119**
> "Īśvara is the cause of the world." Tell me, what really is Īśvara? If you say "the elements"—let it be so! But why the trouble over a mere name?

**Verse 120**
> Moreover, the elements are many, impermanent, without consciousness, not divine, to be stepped over, impure—earth and so on are not Īśvara.

**Verse 121**
> Space is not the lord, as it is inactive. Not the self, because that was refuted before. And if the creatorship of the unthinkable is also unthinkable, what is there to say about it?

**Verse 143**
> What is made by illusion and what is made by causes—investigate where it comes from and where it goes.

**Verse 144**
> What is seen in the presence of something else and not in its absence—like a reflection, how can it be real when it is artificial?

**Verse 150**
> Thus there is no cessation and no arising. Therefore all this world is unborn and unceased.

**Verse 151**
> The movements of saṃsāra are like a dream. Upon investigation, they are like a plantain tree.⁶ In reality there is no distinction between those passed beyond sorrow and those not.

---

## VI. Conclusion: The Aspiration of Compassion

### Verses 152–168: Question and Resolve

**Verse 152**
> With all phenomena thus empty, what is gained and what is lost? By whom will respect or contempt be received?

**Verse 153**
> Whence is happiness or suffering? What is liked or disliked? That craving—when sought in its nature, what is that craving?

**Verse 154**
> Upon investigation, what world of the living exists? Who will die here? What will become? What was? Who is a relative? Who is a friend?

**Verse 155**
> May those like me understand: all is like space! They become angry, they rejoice, through causes of conflict and celebration.

**Verse 163**
> Moreover, moments are difficult to find, the arising of a Buddha is extremely rare, and the flood of afflictions is hard to restrain. Alas, the succession of sufferings!

**Verse 164**
> Alas, those extremely pitiable ones, dwelling in the flood of suffering, who do not see their own distress, even though so extremely distressed!

**Verse 167**
> When shall I bring peace to those tormented by the fire of suffering, through my own resources of happiness arising from clouds of merit?

**Verse 168**
> When shall I teach emptiness to those with views of grasping, while carefully accumulating the collection of merit with conventionalities of non-apprehension?⁷

**Verse 2**

**Verse 9**

**Verse 10**
> May those sunk in the Vaitaraṇī River,³ bodies of white bone with all flesh fallen, skins cooked as in blazing fire—may they, by the power of my virtue, obtain divine bodies and dwell with divine maidens in the Mandākinī River.

---

## II. Liberation from Hell

### Verses 11–18: Vision of the Bodhisattvas

**Verse 11**
> "The servants of Yama, the crows, and the vultures are suddenly terrified—whence is this gentle radiance filling the sky with bliss, the darkness destroyed on all sides?" Looking upward, seeing the blazing Vajrapāṇi⁴ in the sky, may they, through the force of joy, with faults departed, go with him.

**Verse 12**
> May a rain of lotuses fall, mixed with fragrant water, visibly extinguishing the fire of hell. "What is this? Happiness has refreshed me!" May the sight of Kamala-pāṇi ("Lotus-Hand")⁵ come to those in hell.

**Verse 13**
> "Come, come quickly! Cast away fear, brothers! We are alive! A certain radiant, crested youth has arrived among us, giving fearlessness—by whose power all calamities have departed, streams of delight flow, bodhicitta is born, and compassion, the mother who rescues all people."

**Verse 14**
> "Look! This one whose lotus-feet are worshipped with the crowns of hundreds of gods, whose eyes are moist with compassion, on whose head falls a rain of many flowers, whose charming kūṭāgāra-palaces are filled with thousands of goddesses singing praises—seeing Mañjughoṣa before them, may there be jubilation now among those in hell!"⁶

---

## III. For Animals and Hungry Ghosts

### Verses 17–22: May All Lower Realms Be Freed

**Verse 17**
> May the fear of eating one another depart from the animals. May the hungry ghosts become happy, like the humans of Uttarakuru.

**Verse 18**
> May the hungry ghosts be filled, may they be bathed and cooled forever, by the streams of milk flowing from the hand of noble Avalokiteśvara.⁷

**Verse 19**
> May the blind see forms. May the deaf always hear. May pregnant women give birth without pain, as did Māyādevī.

**Verse 20**

---

**Verse 26**

**Verse 27**
> May gods protect those asleep, those unconscious, those in danger—the sick, orphans, and aged, and those without protection.

**Verse 28**
> May all beings be free from all states of misfortune. May they be endowed with faith, wisdom, and compassion. May they have good conduct and proper livelihood.

**Verse 29**
> May they always recall their former lives. May they become weary of all existences. May they go forth from home and be nourished by the Sage.⁸

---

## V. Aspiration for the Dharma

### Verses 41–55: May the Teaching Flourish

**Verse 41**
> May Buddhist monks accomplish their purpose. May they obtain all requisites. May they observe the discipline purely.

**Verse 42**
> May monks disenchanted with their ways find joy. May they study and teach without distraction. May meditators find suitable places for retreat.

> May all beings of the lower realms be reborn among humans. And may those humans meet with the teaching of the Buddha.

**Verse 44**
> May all beings worship all the Buddhas. May they become possessed of boundless happiness.
