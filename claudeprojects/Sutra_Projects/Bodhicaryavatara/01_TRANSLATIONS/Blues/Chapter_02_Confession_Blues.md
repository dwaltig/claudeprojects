# Chapter 2: Laying My Burden Down

## Pāpadeśanā — The Confession

*A Blues Interpretation by William Altig*

---

## Bringing Everything I Got

Before I can take hold of that precious waking-up mind—that jewel I been telling you about—I got to come correct.¹ I got to bring something to the table.

So here I am, laying my offerings before the ones who made it home, before the truth itself, before all their children who walk that same road.

And Lord, what have I got to give?

I'm bringing every flower that ever bloomed, every fruit that ever hung heavy on the branch. Every healing herb that grows wild. Every jewel buried deep in the earth. Every clear, sweet water running down the mountain.²

Mountains themselves—made of precious stone. Those quiet forest places where a soul can be alone. Vines covered in blossoms like they're dressed for church. Trees bowing down with good fruit.

Up in the higher realms—incense rising, wish-granting trees, lakes covered in lotuses where the swans call out sweet.³

And the crops that spring up on their own, with nobody planting them—everything beautiful that exists, all the way to the edges of space—none of it belongs to anybody anyway.

I'm gathering all of it in my mind, and I'm handing it over to the great ones and their children. Please, y'all. Take it from me. I know you feel for me. Have mercy and accept what I'm offering.⁴

Because truth be told? I'm broke. Spiritually bankrupt.⁵ I ain't got nothing else. So take this, whatever it is, for my sake. You're the ones who care about folks like me. Accept it by your own power, because mine ain't enough.

## I Give Myself

And you know what? Here's the real offering.

I give myself.⁶

All of me. Every bit. To the Victors. To their children. Whatever I am, whatever I got, it's yours now.

Take me in. I'm coming to work for you. Not because I have to—but because when you own me like this, I ain't scared no more. I'm free to help people. I can step over all the wrong I done before.⁷ And I won't be doing that no more.

## Washing Their Feet

Now let me tell you how I want to honor them.

Picture a bathhouse—floors of crystal so clean they shine, canopy overhead glittering with pearls, pillars made of gems that catch the light.⁸ The whole place smelling like something holy.

I'm pouring water from jeweled vessels, water full of flowers and sweet fragrance. I'm bathing the great ones and their children, and there's music playing, songs rising.

I dry them off with the finest cloths—spotless, perfumed. Then I dress them in robes dyed in deep colors, scented just right.⁹

I'm dressing up Samantabhadra and Mañjuśrī and Avalokiteśvara—the ones who made it—in the softest fabric, hung with the finest jewelry.¹⁰

I'm anointing their bodies with perfume that spreads across a billion worlds. Their skin shines like polished gold.

I'm covering them with flowers—māndārava blossoms from heaven, blue lotuses, jasmine—everything sweet and beautiful I can find.¹¹ Incense clouds rising around them. And I'm laying out food and drink, everything good.

I'm setting out lamps on golden lotuses, scattering more flowers on the perfumed floors.

I'm offering palaces radiant with pearls, ringing with praise-songs.

I'm holding jeweled parasols over their heads.

May clouds of offerings keep rising forever—music, instruments, everything that gladdens the heart. May flowers and jewels rain down on every holy place without end.¹²

---

## Following in Their Steps

Just like Mañjughoṣa and the others worship the ones who made it home—that's how I'm worshipping too.¹³

With an ocean of my voice, I praise these oceans of virtue.

I bow down as many times as there are atoms in every buddha-field—to all the awakened ones past, present, and future. To the truth. To the community.

I venerate every holy shrine, every place where bodhisattvas dwell.

I bow to my teachers.

I bow to every practitioner worthy of respect.

---

## I Go for Refuge

And now I go.¹⁴

I go for refuge to the Buddha—all the way till I'm sitting under that tree myself.

I go for refuge to the Dharma.

I go for refuge to the bodhisattvas, all of them.

And standing here with my palms together, I got something to say to the awakened ones in every direction, to all the compassionate ones:

---

## My Confession

*Here it is. Here's my burden.*

From the very beginning—and I mean *the beginning*, before time had a name—in this life and all the ones before it:¹⁵

Whatever wrong I did with my own hands—I confess it.

Whatever wrong I caused somebody else to do—I confess it.

Whatever wrong I watched happen and said "Good, that's good"—fool that I was, digging my own grave—I confess it.

I'm burning with regret right now.¹⁶

Whatever I did against the Three Jewels. Whatever I did against my mother and father. Whatever I did against my teachers. Whatever contempt I showed in body, speech, and mind.

All the terrible things—done by me, a sinner heavy with faults—

I confess.¹⁷

---

## Death Is Coming

*Listen now. This is the part that scares me.*

How am I gonna get out of this mess? Save me quick! Because death is coming, and my account ain't settled.¹⁸

Death—that assassin who don't care whether you finished your work or not. Healthy, sick, don't matter. Death don't trust nobody and nobody should trust death. It comes down like a bolt from the sky.¹⁹

All my life, I did wrong for people I loved and people I hated. And I never stopped to think: *I got to leave all of it behind.* Every single person. Every single thing.

The ones I can't stand? They ain't gonna be here.
The ones I love? They ain't gonna be here.
*I* ain't gonna be here.
Nothing. Nothing at all.²⁰

Everything you ever felt, everything you ever touched—it fades into memory. Like something you dreamed. Gone. Never to be seen again.²¹

Right here, right now, while I'm standing in this very spot, so many loved ones have already left. So many enemies too. But the wrong I did on their account? That's still here. Right in front of me. Terrible.²²

I thought I was permanent. I thought this was my home. I forgot I was just passing through.²³ And because I forgot, I let delusion and craving and hatred run my life. And I did wrong, wrong, wrong.

Day and night, without rest, my life is draining away. There's no refill. There's nothing coming back. Am I really gonna die?²⁴

When I'm lying on that bed, even with all my people around me—the pain that cuts me to the quick? I got to bear that alone.²⁵

When death's messengers grab hold of me, where's my family gonna be? Where's my friends? All that can save me is the good I've done—and I ain't done enough.²⁶

I was attached to this fleeting life. I didn't understand the danger. And in my heedlessness, Protectors—I piled up so much wrong.

You ever see a man being led off to have his hand cut off? He goes pale. Mouth dry. Eyes wild. Seeing the world like he never saw it before.²⁷

How much worse when death's messengers got you? When you're burning with terror-fever, when you've lost control of your body?²⁸

You look around with panicked eyes—north, south, east, west—searching for somebody, anybody, who can help.

"Who's gonna save me from this?"²⁹

And you see: the directions are empty. No help anywhere. And you fall back into confusion.

*What am I gonna do?*³⁰

## Going Back to the Refuge

This very day—right now—I go for refuge.³¹

To the mighty Lords of the World.
To the Victors who work to protect us.
To the ones who take away all fear.

And to the truth they realized—the truth that kills the fear of going-round-and-round—I go for refuge with my whole heart. And to the bodhisattva community too.

Trembling, I give myself to Samantabhadra.

And again, of my own free will, I give myself to Mañjughoṣa.

And to Avalokita—that Protector whose every move is driven by compassion—I cry out loud, terrified: *Protect me! I'm a sinner!*³²

To Ākāśagarbha! To Kṣitigarbha!³³ To all the great compassionate ones! I'm looking everywhere for help, and I'm crying out!

I bow to the Vajra-holder—that one whose very sight makes death's messengers run screaming in four directions.³⁴

I broke your rules before. I didn't listen. But now—now I see the danger. I'm coming to you scared. Take away my fear. Do it fast.

Even somebody with a passing cold follows the doctor's orders. How much more somebody with four hundred and four diseases?³⁵

One disease can kill everybody in the world. And there's no medicine for it anywhere.

So if I ignore the words of the Doctor who knows everything, who cures everything—shame on me. Shame on me, so deep in delusion.³⁶

I'm careful at ordinary cliffs. How much more at this cliff that drops for a thousand miles, for a thousand ages?³⁷

"Death ain't coming today"—that thought is poison. Because that time is coming. The time when I will not be.

Who made me fearless? How am I gonna escape? *I'm definitely gonna die.* So why is my heart so calm?³⁸

All those experiences I had, the ones that are already gone—what's left of them? Nothing. But I clung to them so hard I broke every rule.³⁹

When I leave this world—leave my people, everybody I know—I go alone. Somewhere.⁴⁰ What good are any of them to me now, loved or hated?

No, my only concern, day and night, should be this: *How do I get free of the suffering that's definitely coming from my wrongdoing?*⁴¹

---

## The Final Words

Whatever wrong I accumulated—fool that I am, dull that I am—whether wrong by nature or wrong by rule—⁴²

All of it, I confess. Standing right here, in front of the Protectors. Palms together. Terrified of the pain to come. Bowing down again and again.⁴³

May the Leaders acknowledge my transgression as transgression.

This wasn't good, Protectors.

I won't do it again.⁴⁴

*Here ends the second chapter, "Laying My Burden Down"—the Confession—from Śāntideva's guide. May laying it down lighten someone's load.*

## Theological Notes

- **Blues and Confession**: This chapter is pure Blues territory. The confession motif—laying your burden down, admitting what you've done wrong, crying out for help—runs deep in both traditions. Śāntideva's brutal honesty about his failures resonates with the Blues practice of testimony.

- **Fear as Teacher**: The meditation on death (vv. 33-47) uses terror to wake us up. The Blues knows this too: trouble teaches truth.

- **Crying Out**: The cries to Avalokiteśvara and other protectors are not philosophical—they're desperate. This is religion at the level of the gut, not the head.

- **Self-Offering**: "I give myself" is the radical surrender at the heart of both Buddhist practice and the Blues surrender to truth.
