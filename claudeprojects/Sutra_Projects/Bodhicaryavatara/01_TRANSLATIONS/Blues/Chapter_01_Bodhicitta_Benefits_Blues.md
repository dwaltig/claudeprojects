# Chapter 1: The Light That Changes Everything

## Bodhicittānuśaṃsaḥ — The Blessings of the Waking-Up Mind

*A Blues Interpretation by William Altig*

## Opening: A Humble Man's Prayer

Now before I say anything at all, let me bow down low—down to the ground—to all those who walked this road before me and made it home.¹ To their children who followed in their footsteps. To the truth itself that lives in them. To everyone who ever earned respect by living right.

What I'm about to tell you is how you enter into that same discipline² they lived by—how you become one of their people.

And let me be honest with you right from the start: I ain't got nothing new to say here. I'm no great writer, no fancy wordsmith. I didn't write this down for anybody else—I wrote it to get my own heart right.³ But if it helps me find my way, and if someone like me happens to read it and it helps them too, well then, that's a blessing on top of a blessing.

## The Moment You Got

Friends, let me talk to you about this moment you're standing in.

You know how hard it was to get here? To have a mind that can think, a heart that can feel, a chance to actually do something with this life? This right here—this moment—is rarer than you know.⁴ It's like winning a lottery you didn't even know you'd entered.

And if you don't use it? If you just let it slip by without doing the work? 

Tell me—when you think you gonna get this chance again?

It's like this: imagine the darkest night you ever seen. Clouds so thick you can't even see your own hand. And then—*flash*—lightning cracks the sky and for one split second you can see *everything*.⁵ That's what it's like when the truth touches your mind. For one instant, you can see which way to go. But then it's dark again.

See, the thing is, doing right is always weak in us. It's always struggling, always fragile. But the wrong in us? That's strong. That's been building up for lifetimes, and it's got deep roots.⁶

So what can beat it? What can turn all that darkness around?

Only one thing. Only that waking-up mind.⁷

## The Jewel That Transforms

The wise ones—the ones who saw clear for countless ages⁸—they looked at everything, turned it over and over, and they all came to the same conclusion: *this is the thing*. This waking-up mind is what works.

Why? Because once it takes hold, happiness starts growing easy, effortless, and it keeps growing until it overflows and floods the whole world with joy.

Listen to me now:

If you want to get through the hundred kinds of suffering this world throws at you—don't let go of this mind.

If you want to take the suffering off other people's backs—don't let go of this mind.

If you want to taste real happiness, the kind that doesn't run out—*don't ever let go of this mind*.⁹

Picture somebody chained up, stuck walking circles in the same prison yard, day after day, year after year. That's us in this world of going-round-and-round.¹⁰ But the moment—the *instant*—that waking-up mind rises in your heart? 

You become royalty. Child of those who made it home. Heaven and earth bow down to you.¹¹

It's like alchemy.¹² You take this dirty, broken-down body of yours—this thing made of mess and pain—and the waking-up mind touches it, and suddenly it's precious. It's a temple. It's gold.

So hold on tight to this elixir.

The caravan leaders who guide people through dangerous country—the ones who've scouted every path and know which ones lead home—they've tested this thing and found it true.¹³ If you've been wandering from stop to stop all your life, never quite arriving, then grab hold of this jewel.

Most good things you do? They're like the banana tree—bear fruit once and then they're done, used up, gone.¹⁴ But the tree of the waking-up mind? It bears fruit *and keeps bearing fruit*. Never runs dry. Only gets stronger.

Even if you've done terrible things—I mean *terrible* things—this mind can carry you over that, quick as a hero pulls you out of danger.¹⁵ So why in the world wouldn't you reach for it?

It burns up your wrongdoing like the fire at the end of the age.¹⁶ Maitreya himself—the great one who's coming—told young Sudhana all about this, how many blessings it brings.¹⁷

## Two Ways to Wake Up

Now, there's two kinds of this waking-up mind, and you ought to know the difference.¹⁸

First there's the *wishing kind*: you see the road, you want to walk it, you say "I'm gonna get there and I'm gonna bring everybody with me."

Then there's the *walking kind*: you actually step onto that road and start moving.

Think of it this way: one person says "I sure would like to go to Memphis." That's wishing.

Another person gets in the car and drives. That's walking.

Both matter. The wish is powerful—even just *wishing* to wake up for everybody's sake, that's a beautiful thing, and it bears fruit. But the one who's actually moving? That's something else entirely.

Because once you really commit—I mean *really* commit, with your whole heart, saying "I will not stop until every single being is free"¹⁹—from that moment on, even when you're asleep, even when you're not paying attention, blessings flow out of you like rivers that never run dry, wide as the sky itself.²⁰

The Buddha himself said so. You can look it up.²¹

## Greater Than You Know

Let me try to show you how big this thing is.

Say somebody wakes up one morning thinking "You know what, I'm gonna help people with their headaches today."²² Just that thought—that simple intention—brings more good into their life than they could ever count.

So what about someone who says "I want to take away every kind of suffering from every single being, and give every single one of them more good than they can hold"?²³ You can't even measure that.

What mother loves like that? What father? What god in heaven, what angel, what sage ever had that kind of heart?²⁴

Those very people you'd be helping—they don't even wish this good for themselves, not in their wildest dreams!²⁵ How could they ask for it from someone else?

And here comes this rare being—this jewel among people—who wants for others what nobody even wants for themselves.²⁶

How do you measure the worth of such a heart? It's the seed of all the world's joy, the medicine for all the world's pain.²⁷

Just by *wishing* well for others, you're doing something greater than any offering you could bring to any altar. And if you actually get up and *work* for everybody's happiness?²⁸

Lord have mercy.

## The Tragedy of Running the Wrong Way

See, here's the sad truth about most folks:

They're trying to run from suffering—but they're running straight toward it.²⁹ They're chasing after happiness—and in their confusion, they're destroying the very happiness they're after, like it was their enemy.

That's the human condition, friend. That's the blues we all got.

But then there's another kind of person—the kind who looks at all these desperate, suffering, starving-for-happiness people and says: "I'm gonna fill them up. I'm gonna cut off what hurts them. And I'm gonna break the very confusion that keeps them running in circles."³⁰

Where you gonna find another friend like that?

Where you gonna find another good like that?

Sure, we praise people who pay back a favor. But the bodhisattva? They ain't waiting to be asked. They ain't keeping score. They help without being prompted, love without conditions.³¹

What can you even say about somebody like that?

## The Great Feast

Think about a person who feeds a few hungry folks.³² Gives them a meal, maybe keeps them going for half a day. Even if they're a little condescending about it—people still say, "That person did a good thing."

Now think about somebody who could feed *everybody*—for all time—not just food for the belly, but everything the heart could ever want.³³ Not for a day, but forever. Not for a few people, but for as many people as there is sky.

That's the bodhisattva's gift.

And the Master says: anybody who harbors hatred in their heart against such a one—they're gonna suffer for it, long and hard.³⁴

But if your heart opens to them in faith? The blessings just pour in, even without effort.³⁵ Because it's easy to do good toward such people—the hard thing is doing wrong.

---

## Going Home

So here I am, bowing down to the very bodies of those people in whom this jewel-mind has risen.³⁶

Because even when you hurt them? That hurt turns into blessing.

They're the ones who make everything come out good.

I go to them. I take refuge. I go home.

## Theological Notes

- **Bodhicitta as Central**: This chapter establishes the waking-up mind as the single most important factor in spiritual development—more powerful than any other virtue.

- **Transformation, Not Escape**: The Blues perspective reinforces that we don't abandon this broken world; bodhicitta transforms it. The body becomes gold, prison becomes palace.

- **Community of Travelers**: Śāntideva writes for fellow strugglers, not from a position of mastery. This humility is deeply resonant with Blues testimony.

- **The Paradox of Self-Harm**: Verse 28's observation—running toward what hurts us—is perhaps the most Blues-authentic moment in the chapter. We all know this trouble.
