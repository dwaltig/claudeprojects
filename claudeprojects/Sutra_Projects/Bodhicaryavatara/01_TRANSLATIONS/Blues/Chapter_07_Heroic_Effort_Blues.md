# Chapter 7: Get Up and Keep Going

## Vīryapāramitā — The Perfection of Heroic Effort

*A Blues Interpretation by William Altig*

---

## No Effort, No Merit

Now that you've got patience, it's time to get moving.¹

Awakening is founded on effort. Without effort there's no merit at all—just like without wind, nothing moves.

So what is heroic effort? **Enthusiasm for the good.**²

And what's its enemy? Laziness. Attachment to worthless things. Discouragement. Beating yourself down.

## The Sleep Before the Slaughterhouse

Laziness comes from loving the pleasure of doing nothing. From craving sleep. From not being troubled by the suffering of this world.³

Listen now: You've been caught by the afflictions' hunters. You've walked into the trap of birth after birth. And you still don't know you're in the mouth of death?⁴

You watch your own kind being killed off one by one—and yet you go right on sleeping. Like a buffalo in line at the slaughterhouse.⁵

Yama is watching you. Every path is blocked. How can you enjoy eating? How can you sleep? How can pleasure taste good?

Death is coming fast while you're still packing your bags. Even if you drop the laziness then—what are you gonna do when it's too late?

"This I didn't finish. This I barely started. This is still half-done. And now—suddenly—death! Oh no, I'm done for!"

You see your people in despair, faces wet with tears, eyes red, hopeless—and you see the faces of Yama's messengers coming for you.

Burning with memories of your wrongs, hearing the sounds of hell—smeared with the filth of your own terror—what are you gonna do then?

"I'm like a fish still alive"—if that scares you *now*, how much worse when you've done evil and face the hell-suffering to come?

You burn when you touch hot water, delicate one. You've done hell-deeds. How are you sitting there so calm?

You want results without effort. You're soft. You suffer plenty. Death has grabbed you, but you act immortal. Poor suffering soul—you're being destroyed.

**You got this human boat. Cross the river of suffering. Fool, this is no time for sleep—this boat don't come around often.**⁶

You gave up the supreme joy of the Dharma—a stream of happiness that never ends. And you take pleasure in frivolity and laughter, which only bring suffering?

## Don't Give Up on Yourself

Now here's what we need:⁷ No discouragement. An army of strength. Application. Self-mastery. Equalizing self and other.⁸ Exchanging self and other.

Don't say "Awakening can't be for me." The Tathāgata spoke the truth, and here's what he said:

**"Even gnats and flies and mosquitoes and worms have attained that supreme awakening—through the power of their enthusiasm."**⁹

So what about you? Born human, able to tell good from bad? If you don't abandon the path of the All-Knowing Ones, why wouldn't you make it?

If you're scared thinking "I'll have to give my hands and feet"—that's confusion about what's heavy and what's light. You haven't investigated.

For countless aeons beyond counting, you've been cut, torn, burned, split apart—and awakening still didn't arise.

But this suffering of yours now? It's limited. And it accomplishes complete awakening—like the pain of pulling out a splinter that's been bothering you.¹⁰

All doctors heal through painful procedures. To destroy many sufferings, a little must be endured.

But the Supreme Physician doesn't even give harsh treatment. He heals the seriously ill through the gentlest methods.

First, the Guide prescribes giving vegetables and such. Later, gradually, you come to give your own flesh.

When insight into your flesh arises just like insight into vegetables—what's hard about giving up flesh and bone?

No unhappiness from abandoning sin. No sadness from being wise. Suffering comes to the mind from false ideas, and to the body from wrongdoing.

The body is happy through merit. The mind is happy through wisdom. Living in saṃsāra for others' sake, why would the compassionate one be troubled?

Destroying old sins, receiving oceans of merit—through bodhicitta's power alone, you're faster than the Śrāvakas.

Going from happiness to happiness like this—who with sense would be discouraged? You've got the chariot of bodhicitta. It removes all weariness and toil.

## The Four Powers

The powers for accomplishing beings' welfare are:¹¹ **Aspiration, Steadfastness, Delight, and Letting Go.**

Generate aspiration through fear of suffering and by thinking about the benefits.

Uproot laziness this way, then strive to increase your enthusiasm—through aspiration, pride, delight, letting go, application, and self-mastery.

"I must destroy immeasurable faults, mine and others'—but destroying even one fault takes oceans of aeons."

If I don't even see a tiny beginning of destroying faults, and I'm the vessel for immeasurable suffering—why doesn't my heart burst?

"I must develop countless qualities, mine and others'—but practicing even one quality might not happen in oceans of aeons."

I've never developed even a fraction of these qualities. I got this amazing birth, and I've wasted it.

I haven't experienced the happiness of the great festival of worshipping the Blessed One. I haven't served the Teaching. I haven't fulfilled the hopes of the poor.

I never gave fearlessness to the fearful. I never made the suffering ones happy. I only became a spike of pain in my mother's womb.¹²

From losing my wish for the Dharma in past lives, this disaster has come. Who would give up the wish for Dharma?

The Sage said aspiration is the root of all good things. And aspiration's root is constantly contemplating how actions ripen.

## What Comes Around

Suffering, mental distress, various fears, and getting blocked from what you want—these arise for those who do evil.

Wherever the wish of the good-doer goes, there, by those very merits, they're honored with the fruit.

But wherever the wish of the evildoer goes, there, by those very sins, they're struck down with weapons of suffering.

Through virtue, the children of the Sugata come before the Sugata—dwelling in cool lotus wombs, fragrant and sweet, their radiance fed by the Victor's voice, their beautiful bodies emerging from lotuses the sage's rays have opened.

Through evil, crying out as Yama's boys strip all the skin off, bodies drenched in fire-heated copper, flesh cut to pieces by blazing swords and lances—one falls again and again on ground made of burning iron.

So generate aspiration for the good, contemplating this carefully. Starting with Vajradhvaja's method,¹³ cultivate pride.

## The Three Kinds of Pride

First examine your capacity. Either take it on or don't. Not doing it is better than starting and then quitting.

In another life this habit continues. Sin and suffering increase. Another task and its time are lost—and even that original task doesn't get done.

Self-confidence goes in three directions:¹⁴ toward action, toward afflictions, toward capacity.

"I alone must do this"—that's pride about action.

This world, controlled by afflictions, can't accomplish its own welfare. So I must do it for them. I'm not incapable like ordinary folks.

When somebody else is doing lowly work, should I just stand there? If pride keeps me from doing it—better if that pride dies.

Even a crow acts like a Garuḍa when it finds a dead snake.¹⁵ If my mind is weak, even small troubles will hurt me.

When you give up, sunk in discouragement, disasters take over easily. But one who rises up and strives is hard to beat, even by the great ones.

So with a firm mind, I'll overcome disaster through disaster.¹⁶ If I want to conquer the three worlds, being beaten would be a joke.

**I must conquer all. I shall be conquered by none. I carry this pride, for I am a child of the Lion of Victors.**¹⁷

Those beings conquered by pride are wretches—they're not truly proud. The proud one doesn't fall under the enemy's power. But those enslaved by negative pride do.

Led by wrong pride to the lower realms, even as humans they've lost all joy—eating others' scraps, slaves, foolish, ugly, wasted away.

Despised everywhere, those ascetics stiff with wrong pride—if they count as "proud," then tell me, what's truly pitiful?

**The truly proud are the victorious. The truly proud are the heroes. They carry pride to conquer the enemy pride—and having killed that quivering enemy pride, they freely give the victory-fruit to beings.**¹⁸

## Love Your Work

Stationed in the middle of the affliction-army, be defiant a thousand times. Be unconquerable by the affliction-hosts—like a lion among deer.

Even in great difficulties, the eye doesn't taste. So even when meeting difficulty, don't fall under the afflictions' power.

**Get addicted to whatever work you're doing. Get drunk on that work. Be insatiable—like someone who wants the pleasure-fruit of a game.**¹⁹

Work is done for happiness, but whether happiness comes is uncertain. For one whose happiness is in the work itself—how could they be happy without working?

In saṃsāra there's no satisfaction in pleasures—they're like honey on a razor's edge. How could there be satisfaction in the nectar of merit, whose ripening is sweet and good?

So even at the end of a task, plunge into the next one—like an elephant scorched by the midday sun, which plunges straight into the lake when it finds one.

But when strength fades, release to continue later. When something's well completed, release with thirst for what comes next.

Guard against the afflictions' blows and strike hard at the afflictions—like someone in a sword-fight with a trained enemy.

Just as you'd quickly and fearfully grab a dropped sword, so grab the dropped sword of mindfulness, remembering the hells.

Just as poison reaching the blood spreads through the body, so when a fault finds an opening, it spreads through the mind.

Like an oil-bearer watched by sword-carriers—if he spills, he dies—so totally focused out of fear, that's how focused the practitioner should be.

So just as you quickly rise when a snake lands in your lap—when sleepiness and laziness approach, counter them fast.

At each misstep, be thoroughly sorry and think: "How do I act so this doesn't happen again?"

Seek out circumstances and companions for this reason: "How can mindfulness practice happen in these situations?"

Make yourself light, remembering the instruction on heedfulness,²⁰ so before any action arrives, you're ready for everything.

**And just as cotton goes wherever the wind takes it, coming and going—so go wherever enthusiasm takes you. That's how success is achieved.**²¹
