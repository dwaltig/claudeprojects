# Chapter 10: Giving It All Away

## Pariṇāmanā — Dedication of Merit

*A Blues Interpretation by William Altig*

---

## This Is for Everybody

Through whatever good came from my contemplating this *Bodhicaryāvatāra*, may all beings become adorned with the bodhisattva way.

May all beings in all directions—afflicted with suffering of body and mind—obtain through my merit oceans of joy and happiness.

As long as they remain in saṃsāra, may their happiness never decrease. May the world attain the unbroken happiness of the bodhisattvas.

In all the world-systems, may those in the hells delight in the joys and delights of Sukhāvatī.¹

May those suffering from cold get warmth. May those suffering from heat become cool—through oceans of water from the great clouds of bodhisattvas.

May the sword-leaf forest become a Nandana grove. May the thorn trees² become wish-fulfilling trees.

May the hell-realms become delightful, with ponds beautiful with the sounds of cranes and swans, fragrant with abundant lotuses.

May the burning coals become a heap of jewels. May the burning ground become crystal. May the crushing mountains become palaces of worship filled with Buddhas.

May the rain of burning coals and weapons become a rain of flowers. May the fighting with weapons become playful fighting with flowers.

May those sunk in the Hell River,³ bodies of white bone, flesh fallen, cooked as in fire—may they, by my virtue, get divine bodies and dwell with divine companions in the heavenly river.

## Getting Out of Hell

"Yama's servants, the crows, the vultures—suddenly terrified! Whence is this gentle radiance filling the sky, the darkness destroyed?" Looking up, seeing blazing Vajrapāṇi⁴ in the sky, may they, through joy, go with him.

May lotus rain fall, mixed with fragrant water, putting out the hell fire. "What is this? Happiness!" May the sight of Lotus-Hand⁵ come to those in hell.

"Come, come quickly! Cast away fear, brothers! We're alive! A radiant youth has arrived—by whose power all calamities depart, streams of delight flow, bodhicitta is born, and compassion, the mother who rescues all."

"Look! This one whose lotus-feet are worshipped by hundreds of gods, whose eyes are moist with compassion, on whose head falls a rain of flowers, whose palaces are filled with thousands of goddesses singing—seeing Mañjughoṣa,⁶ may there be joy among those in hell!"

## For Animals and Hungry Ghosts

May the fear of eating each other leave the animals. May the hungry ghosts become happy, like the humans of Uttarakuru.

May the hungry ghosts be filled, bathed, cooled forever—by streams of milk from noble Avalokiteśvara's hand.⁷

May the blind see. May the deaf always hear. May pregnant women give birth without pain, as did Māyādevī.

May they get whatever they wish: clothing, food, drink, garlands, sandalwood, ornaments. Whatever delights the mind.

## For Everybody, Everywhere

May the fearful become fearless. May those struck with grief find joy. May the despondent become confident, free from anxiety.

May the sick have health. May all beings be freed from bondage. May the weak become strong. May all have loving-kindness toward one another.

May travelers be happy. May all achieve their purpose without effort. May those traveling by ship reach their destinations as they wish.

May those lost in wilderness find caravans. May they travel without fatigue, without fear of thieves and tigers.

May gods protect those asleep, unconscious, in danger—the sick, orphans, aged, and unprotected.

May all beings be free from misfortune. May they have faith, wisdom, and compassion. May they have good conduct and livelihood.

May they always remember former lives. May they become weary of all existences. May they go forth and be nourished by the Sage.⁸

## For the Teaching

May monks accomplish their purpose and obtain all they need. May they observe discipline purely.

May monks who've lost heart find joy. May they study and teach without distraction. May meditators find good retreat places.

May all beings of lower realms be reborn as humans. May those humans meet the Buddha's teaching.

May all beings worship all Buddhas. May they have boundless happiness.

May the intentions of all bodhisattvas for beings' welfare be fulfilled. May beings get whatever the Protectors intend.

May the Pratyekabuddhas and Śrāvakas be happy too.

And may I, through Mañjughoṣa's grace, always remember former lives, and always have ordination until the stages are complete.

May I live on whatever little food suffices. May I find good retreat places in all lives.

Whenever I want to see or ask, may I see Mañjunātha himself, without obstruction.

May my conduct become like Mañjughoṣa's—fulfilling the welfare of all beings in all directions.

**As long as space endures, as long as beings endure, may I too remain—to dispel the suffering of the world.**⁹

Whatever suffering there is for the world, may all that ripen upon me. May the world be happy through the virtues of the bodhisattvas.

---

## The Final Word

May the teaching—the only medicine for suffering, the source of all prosperity—long remain, with honor and support.

I bow to Mañjughoṣa, by whose grace my mind turns toward virtue. I bow to my spiritual friend, by whose grace it grows.

Through the virtue of composing this *Bodhicaryāvatāra*, may all beings enter the bodhisattva way.

May all throughout space who suffer in body and mind obtain through my merit oceans of joy.

As long as they remain in saṃsāra, may their happiness never decrease. May the world obtain the unbroken happiness of the bodhisattvas.

**And may I, in all my lives, become the cause of joy for all beings—causing not even a moment's sorrow for any.**¹⁰
