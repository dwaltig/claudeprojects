# Chapter 3: Taking Hold of the Road

## Bodhicittaparigrahaḥ — Embracing the Waking-Up Mind

*A Blues Interpretation by William Altig*

---

## Joy in Everybody's Good

Let me start with some rejoicing.¹

Every good thing that anybody's ever done—every deed that gives relief to folks stuck in hard places—I'm clapping for that. I'm saying *yes* to that. May everyone who's hurting find some peace.

When somebody gets free from this wheel of going-round-and-round, when somebody makes it to the other shore—I'm happy for them.² When somebody becomes a bodhisattva, when somebody wakes all the way up—I celebrate.

And I rejoice in every great teacher whose heart is an ocean of that waking-up mind, who works day and night for the benefit of all.

## Please Don't Leave Us in the Dark

Now, with my hands pressed together, I'm calling out to all the awakened ones everywhere:

*Light the lamp.*³

There's folks out here stumbling in the dark, falling headlong into suffering because they can't see. Turn on the Dharma-light for them.

And you Victors who've done your work, who are ready to slip away into that peaceful rest—*please wait*.⁴ Don't go yet. Stay for countless ages more. Don't let this world go blind.

---

## I Give It All

So here's my dedication.⁵ Everything good I've ever done, everything good I've gathered up—I'm turning it over. May it become the thing that calms every suffering everywhere.

Let me be medicine for the sick.⁶ Let me be the doctor too. And the nurse who stays at the bedside until they're well for good.

When people are burning with hunger and thirst, let me rain down food and drink. In those terrible famine times between the ages, let me become the meal and the water myself.⁷

For folks who got nothing, let me be a treasury that never runs dry.⁸ Let me show up for them in whatever form they need.

My body, my stuff, all my good deeds from past, present, and future—I hand it all over, no strings attached.⁹ All for the sake of every living being.

And here's the truth: letting go of everything *is* peace. That's nirvana. My mind is heading that way. So if I've got to give it all up anyway, it's better to give it to living beings than to just throw it away.¹⁰

---

## Do What You Want with Me

I've made myself available for the happiness of everybody.¹¹

So go ahead: Kill me. Curse me. Throw dirt on me. I'm not going anywhere.

Play with this body of mine. Laugh at me. Make fun of me. I gave it to you already—why should I worry about it?¹²

Make me do whatever brings you joy. Just let no harm come to anybody through me.¹³

If your dealings with me—whether you're mad at me or pleased with me—if they always lead to your success, that's good enough for me.¹⁴

Those who spread lies about me, those who hurt me, those who make sport of me—may every last one of them share in awakening.¹⁵

---

## I'll Be Everything You Need

Let me be a protector for the unprotected.¹⁶
A guide for travelers.
A boat for those who want to cross the water.
A bridge.
A road.

Let me be a lamp for those who need light.¹⁷
A bed for those who need rest.
A servant for anyone who needs one.

Let me be a wish-granting jewel.¹⁸ An overflowing vessel. A healing spell. A medicine that cures everything. A tree that gives you whatever you ask for. A cow that pours out endless milk.¹⁹

The elements—earth, water, fire, air, space—they serve everybody in countless ways, all the way to the edges of existence.²⁰

Let me be like that: a source of sustenance for every being, in every way they need, until every last one of them is at peace.²¹

---

## This Is My Vow

Here it is. The formal commitment.²²

The way the old Sugatas took hold of this waking-up mind—the way they trained, step by step, in the bodhisattva path—

*That's what I'm doing now.*²³

I generate bodhicitta for the good of the world. And I will train in those same practices, one after another, just like they did.

---

## Celebrating What Just Happened

Now that I've got hold of this thing—now that I've really taken it up with my whole heart—let me gladden my spirit by saying this:²⁴

*Today my birth has become worthwhile.*²⁵

This human life has earned its keep.
Today I was born into the Buddha family.
Now—right now—I'm a child of the Buddhas.

From here on out, I got to act like somebody who belongs to this family.²⁶ I can't disgrace my people. This lineage has got to stay clean.

I'm like a blind man who found a diamond in a garbage heap.²⁷ How in the world did this bodhicitta arise in someone like me?

This is the elixir that destroys the death of the world.²⁸ This is the inexhaustible treasury that ends the world's poverty.

This is the supreme medicine that heals the world's disease.²⁹ This is the shade tree where folks exhausted from walking the roads of existence can rest.

This is the public bridge for everyone crossing out of the hard places.³⁰ This is the moon of the mind, rising to cool the world's afflictions.

This is the great sun that burns away the world's night of ignorance.³¹ This is the fresh butter that comes from churning the milk of the true teaching.

---

## The Feast Is Ready

For the caravan of travelers walking the roads of existence—all of you who are hungry and thirsty for some happiness—the feast is ready.³² 

Come and eat. There's enough for everyone who shows up.

Today, right here, in front of all the Protectors, I'm inviting the whole world: Come to awakening! And on the way, be happy!³³

Gods, demons, and everybody else—*rejoice!*

*Here ends the third chapter, "Taking Hold of the Road"—the formal embrace of the waking-up mind. May taking hold give us strength for the journey.*

## Theological Notes

- **The Vow**: This chapter contains the formal liturgical generation of bodhicitta. Blues interpretation maintains the ceremonial weight while making it feel personal and immediate.

- **Radical Self-Offering**: Verses 12–16 take the confession of Chapter 2 and transform it into positive commitment. "Do what you want with me"—the Blues knows this surrender.

- **Becoming Everything**: The aspiration to be lamp, bed, bridge, boat, medicine—this is universal service without conditions.

- **Celebration**: The exultation "Today my birth has become worthwhile!" is the Blues moment of breakthrough—when the long road finally leads somewhere.
