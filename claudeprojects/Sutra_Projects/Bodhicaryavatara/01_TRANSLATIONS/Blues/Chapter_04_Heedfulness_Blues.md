# Chapter 4: Don't Let Your Guard Down

## Bodhicittāpramādaḥ — Keeping Watch on the Waking-Up Mind

*A Blues Interpretation by William Altig*

---

## You Made a Promise

Now listen here. You took hold of that waking-up mind, didn't you? You said you were going to do this thing.¹

A child of the Victors doesn't slack off. Doesn't get lazy. Doesn't break what they promised.

Sure, if you jumped into something without thinking—just said it hastily—then you can reconsider. That's fair.² But this? This has been examined by the Buddhas. Examined by their wise children. And I examined it too, best I could. So why am I stalling?³

If I promised and then don't deliver, I'm a liar. I've deceived everyone.⁴ And where does that leave me?

The scriptures say that if you even *think* about giving something and then don't, you end up a hungry ghost. And that's for little things.⁵

What about me? I stood up and announced to the whole world: supreme happiness is coming! I proclaimed it loud! Now if I don't follow through—*what becomes of me?*⁶

## The Weight of What You Carry

The thing is, even if you fall—even if you abandon this waking-up mind—the All-Knowing One eventually saves you anyway.⁷ That's how deep the compassion runs.

But that doesn't make falling light. Every stumble a bodhisattva makes is serious. Real serious. Because when you fall, you're dragging down all the beings you promised to help.⁸

And if anybody gets in the way of your merit, even for a second—they're making an enemy of everybody everywhere. That person's gonna fall a long, long way.⁹

Destroy the welfare of one being, you're destroyed. What about destroying the welfare of all beings, from here to the edges of space?¹⁰

So here you are, swinging back and forth—the power of your falls pulling you down, the power of bodhicitta lifting you up—delayed on the road forever.¹¹

## Today Is All You Got

So do what you said. Do it with everything you got. If you don't make the effort *today*, you're sinking from depth to depth.¹²

Countless Buddhas have come and gone. They were looking for everybody, trying to heal everybody. And my own faults kept me out of reach. I never got the medicine.¹³

If I stay the same way I've always been, I'll just keep cycling through the lower realms—sickness, death, being cut up, broken apart, again and again.¹⁴

When am I ever going to get this again?¹⁵ A Buddha appearing in the world. Faith. Human birth. And being in a condition where I can actually practice virtue. This is so rare.

And look—today you're healthy. You got food. Nothing terrible is happening right now. But life is a split second.¹⁶ It's deceiving you. This body you're in? It's borrowed.

If I keep acting like I've been acting, I won't get human birth again. And without that, there's no virtue. Only wrong.¹⁷

When I'm fit to practice virtue and I *don't*—what am I gonna do when I'm bewildered by the suffering of the lower realms?¹⁸

If I don't do good, and I pile up wrong, the word "higher rebirth" is dead for millions of years.¹⁹

That's why the Blessed One said human life is as rare as a blind turtle sticking its neck through a yoke floating on the ocean.²⁰

One moment of evil puts you in the lowest hell for an eon.²¹ And I've been piling up evil since before time had a name. Higher rebirth? Don't even talk about it.

And here's the worst part: even when you're burning in that fire, you're not getting purified. You're breeding more wrong, because the suffering makes you angry, desperate, confused.²² It just keeps going.

There's no bigger deception than this. No bigger fool than me. I got this moment, this chance, and I'm not practicing virtue.²³

## The Fire That's Coming

If I think about all this and still fall back into confusion—the messengers of Yama are gonna torment me for a long, long time.²⁴

Hell-fire is gonna burn this body. And the fire of regret is gonna burn my untrained mind.²⁵ Both fires. For a long, long time.

Somehow—somehow—I made it to this beneficial ground. So hard to reach. And I know what I'm doing, but I'm being led right back to those same hells.²⁶

What's wrong with me? I have no will of my own. It's like I'm under a spell.²⁷ I don't know what's confusing me.

*Who is it that lives inside me?*

---

## Know Your Enemy

Think about it: craving, aversion, delusion—these enemies of mine—they got no hands.²⁸ No feet. They ain't brave. They ain't smart.

So how did they make me a slave?

They're stationed right in my own mind, hitting me whenever they want, comfortable as can be. And I don't even get angry about it!²⁹ Shame on my misplaced patience!

If every god and every human being were my enemies, they couldn't drag me to the fires of the lowest hell.³⁰

But these enemies—the afflictions—they throw me there in a second. They're so powerful that if Mount Meru itself met that fire, there wouldn't even be ashes left.³¹

No other enemy lives this long. My affliction-enemies have been with me since before the beginning. They'll be with me till the end.³² That's a long, long war.

And here's the thing: every other enemy, if you treat them right, might help you out.³³ But these afflictions? The more you serve them, the worse it gets.

So tell me: while these constant, long-lasting enemies—sole causes of every misfortune—are living in my heart, how am I supposed to enjoy life without fear?³⁴

These are the jailers of existence. The executioners in hell. If they're living in the cage of craving inside my mental home—*where is my happiness?*³⁵

---

## Time to Fight

Alright then.³⁶ I'm not laying this burden down until these enemies are dead in front of me.

You know how prideful folks are? They can't even sleep until they've dealt with somebody who offended them over something small.

Meanwhile, soldiers on the battlefield—fighting enemies who are gonna die anyway—charge into arrows and spears.³⁷ They don't turn back, no matter the pain.

So why should I get depressed?³⁸ Why should I be discouraged? My enemies are the constant causes of all suffering. Even if I get knocked down a hundred times, I keep getting up.

People wear their battle scars like jewelry.³⁹ So why should hardship bother me when I'm after something this big?

Fishermen, outcasts, farmers—they endure cold and heat just to survive.⁴⁰ Why can't I endure for the sake of the whole world?

I vowed to free beings from affliction all the way to the edges of space—and I haven't even freed myself!⁴¹ 

When I made that vow without knowing my own limits—was I crazy?⁴² Maybe. But that means I can never, ever turn back from destroying these afflictions. Not now. Not ever.

---

## The Final Vow

In this fight, I'll be ruthless.⁴³ Bound in enmity. At war. Except for the one "affliction" that destroys afflictions—that one I'll keep.

Let my guts spill out.⁴⁴ Let my head fall off. But I will *never* bow down to these enemies.

An ordinary enemy, if you exile him, might find a foothold somewhere else, gather his strength, and come back.⁴⁵ But the afflictions ain't like that. Once they're really expelled from the mind—where are they gonna go?

Driven out of my mind, where would they stay?⁴⁶ Where would they plot against me? The truth is, I just haven't made the effort. These afflictions are pathetic. They're conquered through the eye of wisdom.

Listen now, this is important:⁴⁷

The afflictions don't live in sense objects. They don't live in the sense faculties. They don't live in between. They don't live anywhere else either. So where do they live, these things that torment the whole world?

*It's all illusion.*

So let go of fear. Cultivate effort for wisdom. Why are you torturing yourself in hell for no reason?

Having figured all this out, I'm making the effort.⁴⁸ I'm practicing the trainings that were taught. Because how is a sick man gonna get well if he ignores the doctor's orders?

## Theological Notes

- **The Inner War**: This chapter transforms spiritual life into warfare against the afflictions. The Blues tradition knows about fighting—fighting the bottle, fighting despair, fighting the man. Śāntideva says: the only fight that matters is inside.

- **The Mystery of Bondage**: "Who is it that dwells within me?" This question is the heart of the chapter. We're enslaved by enemies we can't even identify.

- **Illusion as Liberation**: The key insight comes in verse 47—afflictions have no true location, no real substance. They're illusion. The Blues knows this too: sometimes the thing you've been fighting ain't even real.
