# Chapter 8: Stop Running and Sit Down

## Dhyānapāramitā — The Perfection of Meditation

*A Blues Interpretation by William Altig*

## Why You Need to Get Away

Now that you've got the energy, put your mind in meditation.¹

A person with a scattered mind? They're living between the jaws of affliction. Between the fangs.

Through getting your body and mind alone, distraction doesn't arise. So leave the world behind. Drop the mental chatter.

You can't leave the world behind while you're attached to it—still craving gain, still needing approval. So to really let go, think about it this way:

Knowing that calm with insight destroys afflictions, calm should be found first. And that comes from not caring about the world, from loving detachment.²

## The Problem with People

Who among things that don't last should have affection for things that don't last? For thousands of lives, you won't see that beloved again.

Without seeing them, you get no joy. You can't concentrate. Even seeing them, you're not satisfied—just afflicted by craving like before.

You don't see things as they are. You fall from disenchantment. You burn with grief, wanting to meet the beloved.

Thinking about that, your short life goes by—again and again, in vain. By a temporary friend, the eternal Dharma is ruined.

Behaving like fools with fools, you surely go to lower rebirths. Getting led to what's unwholesome—what's gained from fool-company?

In an instant they become friends. In an instant, enemies. They get angry at what should please them. Ordinary people are hard to satisfy.

Tell them something helpful—they get angry, keep you from the good. Don't listen—they get angry and head to lower rebirths.

Jealous of the superior. Competitive with equals. Arrogant to the inferior. Puffed up by praise, angry at criticism. When is there benefit from a fool?

From fool to fool, inevitably comes unwholesomeness: self-praise, bad-mouthing others, talking about worldly pleasures.

So from that association comes meeting with misfortune. I'll dwell alone, happy, with an unafflicted mind.

Flee far from the fool. Having met them, please them with kind words—but not through intimacy. Be indifferent, like a good person passing through.³

## The Joy of Getting Away

Taking only the essence of the Dharma—like a bee taking honey from flowers—I'll dwell everywhere unknown, as if new.

"I'm successful, I'm honored, many want me"—that pride of the mortal leads to fear when death comes.

Wherever the mind deluded by pleasure goes, there that pleasure multiplied a thousand times into suffering stands before it.

So the wise person doesn't desire that. From desire, fear arises. It passes by itself. Having made firmness, just wait.

Many gained wealth. Many gained fame. But where did they go, with their wealth and fame? Nobody knows.

Others despise me—should I rejoice when praised? Others praise me—should I be sad when criticized?

Beings of various tastes aren't satisfied even by the Victors. How much less by an ignorant one like me? So why think about worldly people?

They revile one without gain; they put down one with gain. When those are painful by nature to associate with, how can delight come from them?

"The fool is no one's friend"—so the Tathāgatas have said. The fool's affection comes only from self-interest.

What affection comes through self-interest is affection for self-interest. Just as there's agitation when property's lost—that's from lost happiness, not love.

Trees don't blame. They don't need to be pleased with effort. When will I dwell with those happy companions?

Dwelling in an empty temple, at the foot of a tree, in caves—when will I go without looking back, without concern?

Dwelling in places naturally vast and unclaimed, freely wandering—when will I dwell unattached?

With just an earthen bowl for wealth, with robes unattractive to thieves—when will I dwell fearless, not guarding the body?

Going to my own charnel ground, when will I compare my body with other skeletons—both subject to decay?

This body of mine will become so rotted that even jackals won't approach it because of the smell.

The bones arising together with this single body will become separate. How much more so other beloved people.

Alone one is born. Alone one dies. This share of suffering can't be taken by another. What use are loved ones who just obstruct?

Just as one traveling takes up a dwelling-place, so one journeying through existence takes up the dwelling of a birth.

Until this body is carried out by four people, while the world still grieves—just that long should one go to the forest.

Without intimacy and hostility, this body is already dead to the world. When dying, one doesn't grieve.

No one near causes distress by grieving. No one disturbs remembering the Buddha and such.

So solitude is delightful, free from distress, source of well-being, calming all distractions—always to be cultivated by me.

Released from all other thoughts, with a mind focused single-pointedly on my own mind, I'll strive for concentration and for taming the mind.⁴

## The Body Is Not Your Friend

Sensual pleasures produce misfortune in this world and the next: here through bondage, killing, and cutting; hereafter through hell and such.

*[Verses 41–84: The Foulness Contemplation]*

Now let me tell you something about this body you're so attached to.

What's inside it? Bones held together with sinews. Flesh stretched over the frame. Skin wrapped around the mess. That's it. That's the machine you're worshipping.

Open it up—what do you find? Blood. Bile. Phlegm. Fat. Marrow. Pus. Lymph. Mucus. Urine. Feces. The beloved body is a sack of filth dressed up pretty.

You chase after another person's body? You're chasing the same mess—just wrapped in different skin. Dig underneath the surface you desire and you find the same stench, the same rot waiting to happen.

If the outside is so beautiful, why don't you love the inside too? Why not embrace the guts, the waste, the decay? Because you know what's really there.

This body you work so hard to please—it betrays you constantly. It gets hungry, gets tired, gets sick. It ages before your eyes. And one day, whether you pamper it or neglect it, it ends up in the ground, feeding the worms.

All that effort chasing pleasure, all that energy spent satisfying the body's demands—if you put half that effort toward awakening, you'd already be free.

So ask yourself: Is this body worth all the trouble? Is this temporary shell worth selling your soul for?

The body is bones bound by sinews, covered with flesh and skin. The beloved object of desire is merely filth adorned. Even the effort spent chasing pleasures would achieve awakening if redirected.

Thus recoiling from sensual pleasures, generate delight in solitude, in peaceful forest lands empty of conflict and strife.

## The Forest Hermit's Delight

Happy ones walk on broad rock terraces—palaces pleasant with moonbeam-sandalwood coolness—fanned by the silent, gentle forest breeze—contemplating for the benefit of others.⁵

Dwelling as long as you want in empty places, at the foot of a tree, in caves—freed from the weariness of guarding possessions—wandering as you wish, without concern.

Dwelling where you wish, free, attached to no one—enjoying such happiness of contentment as even Indra would find difficult to obtain.

Thus, through such ways, cultivating the virtues of solitude, with mental chatter calmed, cultivate bodhicitta.

## You and Me Are the Same

First, carefully cultivate equality of self and other:⁶ All are equal in suffering and happiness—they should be protected by me as if they were myself.

Just as the body, with its many parts like hands, is protected as a single thing—so too this world, though different, is the same in suffering and happiness.

Even though my suffering doesn't affect other bodies, it's still suffering unbearable to me because of self-attachment.

So too, even though another's suffering isn't felt by me, it's still unbearable to him because of his self-attachment.

Another's suffering is to be removed by me, for it is suffering, like my own. Others are to be helped by me, for they are beings, like my own being.

When happiness is equally dear to me and to others, what's special about me that I seek happiness for myself alone?

When fear and suffering are equally unwanted by me and others, what's special about me that I protect myself and not others?

If I don't protect them because their suffering doesn't harm me—the suffering of the future body doesn't harm me either. Why then is that protected?

"I'll be that very one then"—this thought is false. For it's one who dies and entirely another who's born.

If whatever suffering someone has should be protected by that very one—foot-suffering is not the hand's. Why then is it protected by it?

What's inappropriate proceeds from grasping an "I." What's inappropriate for oneself and for another is to be abandoned as far as possible.

A continuum and a group are false, like a row and an army. There's no one whose suffering it is. So whose is it to be called "one's own"?

**All sufferings equally are without owner. They are to be warded off simply because they are suffering. What use is a restriction here?**⁷

Why should suffering be warded off? Because everyone agrees without dispute. If it's to be warded off, then all of it equally. If not, then for me as for another.

## The Supreme Secret

One who wishes to quickly rescue self and other should practice that supreme secret: **the exchange of self and other.**⁸

Because of excessive love for the self, there's fear even from small danger. Who wouldn't hate that self like an enemy—it brings so much fear?

One who, to cure hunger and thirst, kills birds, fish, and deer, and lies in wait on the road—

—one who for gain and honor would kill even parents, would steal the Three Jewels' property, and become fuel for Avīci—

—what wise person would want, protect, or honor that self? Who wouldn't see it as an enemy? Who would respect it?

"If I give, what will I eat?"—that's demonic self-interest. "If I eat, what will I give?"—that's divine concern for others.

Harming another for self-interest, one is cooked in hells and such. But harming self for others' sake brings all attainments.

By the very wish for self-exaltation come lower rebirths, low status, and dullness. Transferring that same wish to another, come good rebirths, honor, and wisdom.

Commanding another for self-interest—one experiences slavery and such. Commanding self for others' interest—one experiences lordship and such.

**All who suffer in the world suffer from wanting their own happiness. All who are happy in the world are happy from wanting others' happiness.**

What more need be said? See this difference: the fool seeks his own welfare; the sage acts for others' welfare.

## Taming the Beast

Countless aeons have passed while you sought your own welfare. By that great effort you've gained only suffering.

By my instruction, engage thus without hesitation. Later you'll see its benefits—the Sage's word is true.

If this work had been done before, this condition wouldn't have come about—you'd have the happiness of buddhahood, not this.

So just as you made "I"-grasping toward other drops of blood and sperm, practice the same toward others.

Being another's scout, whatever you see on this body—take it and use it for others' benefit.

Placing self-identity in the inferior and others, with thoughts free from concepts, cultivate jealousy and pride in self.

"This one is honored, not I. I'm not a gainer like this one. This one is praised, I'm blamed. I suffer, this one is happy."

"I do the work, while this one sits comfortably. This one is considered great in the world—I'm considered worthless, without qualities."

What's to be done by the worthless one? Everyone has qualities. There are those to whom I am inferior; there are those to whom I am superior.

*[Verses 157–172: The Self-Other Exchange Meditation]*

You think you got nothing? Well, some folks got even less. Best use this feeling to check your own pride.

You think you're so high and mighty? Look at those below you and feel some humility. The one you envy—they got their own troubles too.

When others disrespect you, when they treat you like you're nothing—that's the fruit of your own karma coming back around. So don't blame them. Accept it.

Now here's the medicine: take all your self-interest, all that "me-first" thinking, and turn it around. Put it on somebody else's behalf.

Whatever you'd do for yourself—do it for them. Whatever hardship you'd take to get ahead—take it for their sake.

This body you're so attached to? It belongs to others now. Use it in their service. Let them have its work, its energy, its life.

The self that wanted praise, wanted gain, wanted to come out on top—reverse it. Now you work in the shadows. Let others have the spotlight.

When the world praises them and criticizes you, be glad. When they get the good and you get the hard—be glad. They're sentient beings, just like you. Their happiness is your happiness now.

Never praise yourself. Never make yourself look good at another's expense. Become their servant—the low one, the helper, the support.

If you have affection for the self, don't take pleasure in the self. If the self is to be protected, this one should not be protected.

The more this body is protected, the more delicate it becomes—and just so, the more it falls.

When it's fallen, even the whole earth can't fulfill its wishes. Then who will fulfill its wish?

For one who wishes what can't be had, affliction and disappointed hope arise. For one without hope in all things, prosperity never decays.

So no scope should be given for the body's wish-increase. That's the good thing: what's not grasped as desirable isn't taken.

This—ending in ashes, inert, moved by another—this horrible impure image—why do I grasp it?

What use is this machine, living or dead? How is it different from a clod of dirt? Alas, why doesn't my "I"-grasping perish?

I've given up this body for the welfare of the world. Though it has many faults, it's maintained as an instrument of action.

So, enough of worldly conduct! Following the wise, remembering the instruction on heedfulness, I'll ward off drowsiness and dullness.

To destroy the obscurations, I'll practice concentration, drawing the mind back from wrong paths, constantly on its own support.⁹

## Theological Notes

- **Running vs. Sitting**: This chapter marks the shift from the "running" of Heroic Effort to the "sitting down" of Meditation. In the Blues, you gotta move, but eventually you gotta stop and face yourself.

- **The Blues of Association**: Verses 33–45 offer a harsh but necessary Blues truth: bad company drags you down. "From fool to fool, inevitably comes unwholesomeness." Sometimes you have to walk alone to walk right.

- **Radical Equality**: The argument that "Suffering has no owner" (v. 101) is the philosophical heart of the chapter. Pain is just pain. It doesn't belong to "me" or "you." This destroys the wall between self and other.

- **The Supreme Secret**: Exchanging self and other isn't just a nice idea—it's the "secret" to breaking the prison of the ego. You become the other; you take their load.
