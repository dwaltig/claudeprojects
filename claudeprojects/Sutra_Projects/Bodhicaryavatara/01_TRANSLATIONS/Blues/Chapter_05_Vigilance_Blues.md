# Chapter 5: Keep Watch on Your Mind

## Saṃprajanyarakṣaṇam — Guarding Clear Awareness

*A Blues Interpretation by William Altig*

## It's All About the Mind

You want to keep the training? Then keep the mind.¹ Can't do one without the other. A wandering mind can't hold onto anything.

An elephant gone wild can wreck a village. But that's nothing compared to what the wild elephant of your mind can do—it'll drag you straight to hell.²

But if you tie that elephant up with the rope of mindfulness, wrap it around him on all sides—fear goes away. And everything good comes close.³

Tigers, lions, bears, snakes, enemies of every kind, the jailers of hell, demons and evil spirits⁴—*all of them* are bound when you bind the one mind. *All of them* are tamed when you tame the one mind.

That's what the Teacher of Truth said: all fear, all suffering without limit—it comes from the mind.⁵

Think about it: who forged all those weapons in hell? Who heated up that iron floor? Where did all those tormentors come from?⁶

The Sage said: it all comes from the sinful mind. There's nothing scarier in all the worlds than the mind.

## The Sandal Wisdom

Now here's something that'll change how you think.

If the perfection of generosity meant making the whole world rich, then how did the old masters perfect it?⁷ The world's still poor.

No—the perfection of generosity is the *mind* of giving everything away.⁸ That's why it's called a perfection. It's the mind.

Same with ethics. Where am I supposed to lead all the fish so I don't kill them?⁹ Impossible. But when the mind of renunciation is obtained—*that's* the perfection.

How many wicked people can I kill? They're countless as the sky.¹⁰ But when I kill the mind of anger—all enemies are dead.

Here's my favorite: where am I gonna find enough leather to cover the whole earth?¹¹ There's not enough leather in the world.

But with just enough leather for the bottom of my sandals—the whole earth is covered.

Same with everything else. I can't control what's out there. But I *can* control what's in here.¹² And once I do that, what else needs controlling?

All your recitations, all your austerities, all your spiritual exercises—if the mind is elsewhere, it's pointless.¹³ The All-Knowing One said so.

The mind is the secret essence of all Dharma.¹⁴ People wander through space trying to escape suffering and find happiness, but they never cultivated this one thing.

So I'm gonna keep my mind well-placed. The vow to guard the mind—that's the only vow I need.¹⁵

## Mindfulness and Clear Seeing

You know how in a rough crowd you'd protect an open wound?¹⁶ Careful not to let anybody bump it?

That's how you protect the wound of the mind when you're around bad company.

I'm scared of a little pain from a cut, so I'm careful. Why wouldn't I be careful about the wound of the mind—when what's at stake is the crushing mountains of hell?¹⁷

Live like this, and you can walk among the wicked. You can walk among beautiful, seductive people. The steadfast practitioner doesn't break.¹⁸

Let gains be lost. Let honor be lost. Let this body go. Let other virtues go. *But never let the mind go.*¹⁹

I'm begging you—if you want to guard the mind, guard mindfulness and clear seeing.²⁰ Guard them with everything you've got.

Somebody sick with a disease can't work. Same thing: a mind without these two can't do anything.²¹

Everything you learned, everything you thought about, everything you meditated on—it drains away like water from a cracked pot if you're not paying attention.²²

Even the learned, even the faithful, even the diligent—without clear seeing, they fall.²³

There's a robber called Non-Attention, and he follows after the theft of mindfulness.²⁴ He'll steal all your merit and send you straight to the lower realms.

The affliction gang is looking for an opening.²⁵ The moment they get in, they rob you blind and kill your chance at a higher life.

So don't ever let mindfulness leave the door of the mind.²⁶ And if it does leave, bring it back by remembering what's waiting in the lower realms.

If you're lucky enough to have a teacher, if you're respectful, if you've got some fear—mindfulness comes easy.²⁷

The Buddhas and bodhisattvas see everywhere.²⁸ Everything is in front of them. I'm standing right in front of them.

Think about that. Stay modest. Stay respectful. Stay a little scared. Remembrance of Buddha will come again and again.

When mindfulness stands guard at the door of the mind, then clear seeing arrives.²⁹ And once it comes, it doesn't leave.

## Like a Log

First thing: keep the mind ready.³⁰ Think to yourself: "I'm gonna stay like I have no senses. Like a log."

Don't go throwing your eyes around.³¹ Keep the gaze down, like you're meditating. Sometimes you can look at the horizon to rest your eyes. If you see somebody, acknowledge them. But that's it.

On the road, look around for danger.³² Stop and look behind you. Before going forward or back, check where you're going. In every situation, know what you're doing before you do it.

Fix the body in position, then check midway through: "How's the body doing?"³³

With all your effort, watch whether the mind-elephant is tied to the pillar of Dharma meditation.³⁴

Ask yourself again and again: "Where is my mind right now?"³⁵ Don't let go of concentration even for a moment.

If there's celebration or danger and you can't maintain this, that's okay—do what you need to do.³⁶

But whatever task you take up, stick with it.³⁷ Don't jump to something else. Finish what you started, with your whole self in it. Otherwise nothing gets done, and non-attention grows stronger.

When curiosity arises about gossip and entertainment—destroy it.³⁸

When you find yourself playing with dirt, tearing grass, drawing meaningless lines—remember the training.³⁹ Quit immediately, with fear.

Before you move, before you speak, examine the mind.⁴⁰ Then act with steadiness.

And here's the key:⁴¹

**When you see your mind is attached or hostile—don't act. Don't speak. Stay like a log.**

When the mind is arrogant, mocking, full of pride, deceptive, making a show⁴²—*like a log.*

When it's comparing itself to others, feeling contentious, getting aggressive⁴³—*like a log.*

When it's chasing gain, honor, reputation, followers, service⁴⁴—*like a log.*

When it's indifferent to others, just out for itself, wanting to show off in a crowd⁴⁵—*like a log.*

When it's impatient, lazy, scared, impudent, running its mouth, attached to its own side⁴⁶—*like a log.*

Whenever you see the mind afflicted or chasing pointless activity, the warrior restrains it.⁴⁷ Hard. With the antidote.

## The Good Mind

Here's what to cultivate instead:⁴⁸

Determined. Serene. Steady. Respectful. Modest. A little fearful of wrong. Peaceful. Eager to please others.

Don't get worn out by childish people's conflicting desires.⁴⁹ Have compassion—know that their confusion comes from affliction.

Hold the mind under your power, directed toward blameless things, like a magical creation, without ego.⁵⁰

Remember again and again: you waited so long for this excellent moment.⁵¹ Hold the mind immovable, like Mount Meru.

## What's the Body Anyway?

When vultures fight over a corpse, dragging it here and there, the body doesn't resist.⁵² So why are you going to such trouble for its sake?

Hey, mind—why do you guard this body like it belongs to you?⁵³ Why do you get all proud about it? If it's separate from you, what do you lose by letting it go?

You fool—you won't even take a *clean* wooden doll as your own.⁵⁴ So why do you protect this stinking machine made of filth?

Go ahead—separate the skin bag with your own understanding.⁵⁵ Use the sword of wisdom to cut the flesh from the bones.

Separate the bones. Look at the marrow inside.⁵⁶ Now ask yourself: "What's the essence here?"

After all that searching, you haven't found any essence.⁵⁷ So tell me—why are you still protecting this body?

You can't eat the flesh (it's impure). You can't drink the blood. You can't suck the guts.⁵⁸ What exactly are you going to do with it?

It's fitting to keep it as vulture-food and jackal-food.⁵⁹ But this body of a human being—it's a tool for work. That's what it's good for.

Even as you guard it, pitiless death will snatch it and throw it to the vultures.⁶⁰ What will you do then?

You don't give expensive clothes to a servant who won't stay.⁶¹ The body's gonna eat and leave. Why are you spending so much on it?

Give it wages, sure—then attend to your own welfare.⁶² Not everything the worker earns should go to the worker.

Think of the body as a boat.⁶³ It goes places. Use it for traveling—send it wherever it needs to go for the welfare of beings.

## How to Live Every Day

Once you've mastered yourself, always have a smiling face.⁶⁴ Give up frowning. Be the first to speak. Be a friend to the world.

Don't throw things down with a crash.⁶⁵ Don't slam doors. Love silence.

The heron, the cat, and the thief—they move silent and unseen, and they get what they want.⁶⁶ Move like that.

Accept instruction from those who help without being asked.⁶⁷ Be everyone's student.

Say "Well done!" when something is well done.⁶⁸ Praise people who do good.

Talk about others' good qualities behind their back.⁶⁹ When someone praises you, reflect that they appreciate goodness itself.

Everything we do is for satisfaction—and it's hard to buy.⁷⁰ So enjoy the satisfaction of other people's virtues. It costs nothing here and brings great happiness later.

Speak with trustworthy words, clear meaning, pleasant to hear, rooted in compassion, soft and gentle.⁷¹

Look at beings straight on, like you're drinking them in with your eyes.⁷² Think: "These are the ones who will carry me to awakening."

Be skillful. Be diligent. Do things yourself.⁷³ Don't give anybody an opening in any task.

The perfections go in order—generosity, ethics, patience, and up.⁷⁴ Don't abandon a higher one for a lower one, except for the sake of good conduct.

Once you understand, stay engaged in others' welfare.⁷⁵ For the compassionate who see the benefit, even what's technically forbidden becomes permitted.

Share your food with the fallen, the unprotected, those under vows.⁷⁶ Eat moderately. Give away everything but the three robes.

Don't push the body around for trivial reasons when it serves the true teaching.⁷⁷ That way you fulfill the hopes of beings quickly.

## Study the Teachings

The conduct of bodhisattvas is immeasurable.⁷⁸ At minimum, practice purifying the mind.

Three times by day and three times by night, recite the Three Sections.⁷⁹ Through bodhicitta and the Victors, downfalls are pacified.

Whatever situation you're in—whether you put yourself there or someone else did—train in the trainings that fit that situation.⁸⁰

There's nothing the children of the Victors shouldn't train in.⁸¹ For one living like this, there's nothing that isn't merit.

Everything you do, directly or indirectly, should be for beings' welfare.⁸² And for beings' sake, dedicate everything to awakening.

Never abandon your spiritual friend, even at the cost of your life—the one who holds the bodhisattva vow and knows the Mahāyāna.⁸³

Learn how to serve the teacher from the Śrīsaṃbhava chapter.⁸⁴ Learn the rest from reading the sutras.

The trainings are in the sutras—so read them.⁸⁵ Check the root downfalls in the Ākāśagarbha Sutra.

Study the *Śikṣāsamuccaya* again and again.⁸⁶ It shows daily conduct in detail.

Or at least check the *Sūtrasamuccaya* and Nāgārjuna's other work.⁸⁷

From these, see what's forbidden and what's required.⁸⁸ Practice the training to protect the mind of worldly beings.

## The Definition

Here's what clear awareness is, in a nutshell:⁸⁹

**Repeated examination of the state of body and mind.**

That's it.

And I'm gonna read this with my *body*, not just my voice.⁹⁰ What good does it do a sick person to just *read about* medicine?
