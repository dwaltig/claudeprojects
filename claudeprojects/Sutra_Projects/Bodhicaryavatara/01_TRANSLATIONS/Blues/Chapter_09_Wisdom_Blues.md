# Chapter 9: There's Nothing There

## Prajñāpāramitā — The Perfection of Wisdom

*A Blues Interpretation by William Altig*

---

## Everything Before Was for This

All that preparation the Sage spoke about—it was all for wisdom.¹

So if you want to end suffering, generate wisdom.

Two truths, they say: conventional and ultimate.² Reality is beyond what the mind can grasp. What the mind grasps is called conventional.

The world is seen two ways: by the yogin and by ordinary people. The ordinary person's view gets overturned by the yogin's.

And yogins get overturned by higher yogins still—through sharper intelligence. For the sake of an outcome both accept. Without overanalyzing.

By the world, things are seen and considered real—not illusion-like. Here's where yogins and the world disagree.

Even seeing form directly is by convention, not by true knowing. That convention is false—like calling impure things "pure."

To lead the world, the Protector taught things as if real. In truth, they're momentary. If that contradicts convention—so be it.

No problem for the yogin by way of convention. Truth-seers see differently from the world. Otherwise the world would contradict the perception of bodies as impure.³

## You're Not What You Think

If there's fear from what produces suffering, let there be fear! But emptiness calms suffering—why fear that?

If there's any self, let fear come from that! But I am not anything at all. If "I" am nothing, fear of whom will there be?

I am not teeth, hair, or nails. I am not bones. I am not blood. I am not mucus, phlegm, pus, or lymph.

I am not fat, sweat, marrow, or entrails. I am not the gut. I am not feces and urine.

I am not flesh, not sinews. I am not warmth or wind. I am not the holes in the body. I am not the six consciousnesses in any way.

*[Verses 59–90: The Search for Self and Consciousness]*

Look for yourself in there. Is the "I" in hearing sounds? Are you the same as the hearing? Then what happens when the sound stops?

Is consciousness permanent? Then why doesn't it know everything at once? Why does it come and go, sharp and dull?

If it knows without an object, a pillar would know itself! But consciousness depends on what it's conscious of—there's no consciousness floating free.

What about the mind that watches the mind? That's like your eye seeing your own eye. You can't really do it.

And the great schools of philosophy—the Sāṃkhya with their *prakṛti*, the dialecticians with their eternal atoms—where's the solid ground? Analyze anything far enough and it dissolves like mist.

If things truly existed from their own side, independent and eternal, nothing would change. But everything changes. So nothing exists the way we think it does.

This doesn't mean there's nothing at all—it means there's nothing *substantial* behind the show. The dream is real as a dream. We just stop mistaking it for something more.

"If there's no being, toward whom is compassion?" Toward what's projected for results—through the delusion we've accepted.

"Whose is the result if there's no being?" True, the effort comes from delusion. But to stop suffering, the delusion of the result isn't stopped.

But the delusion of the self—the cause of suffering—grows from thinking "I." If that too can't be stopped, better to meditate on selflessness.

## The Body Is Empty

The body is not the feet. Not the calves. Not the thighs. Not the hip. Not the belly. Not the back. Not the chest. Not the arms.

It's not the hands. Not the sides. Not the armpits. Not the shoulders. Not the neck. Not the head. Then what is the body here?

There is no body. But from confusion there's the idea of a body in the hands and such, due to arrangement—like mistaking a post for a person in the dark.⁴

So when form is like a dream, who's attached when you investigate? When the body doesn't exist like that—who's a woman and who's a man?

---

## Nothing Has True Existence

If suffering truly exists, why doesn't it afflict the happy? If delicacies are truly pleasant, why aren't they enjoyed by the grieving?

When there's no experiencer at all and feeling also doesn't exist—then, O craving, having seen this situation, why aren't you destroyed?

There's no experiencer at all. Therefore feeling doesn't truly exist. In this selfless aggregate, who exactly is hurt by it?

The mind is not in the sense organs. Not in form and such. Not in between. The mind isn't found within or without. It's not found elsewhere.

**What's not in the body nor elsewhere, not mixed nor separate anywhere—that is nothing at all. Therefore beings are by nature beyond sorrow.**⁵

---

## Against the Makers and Causes

"God is the cause of the world." Tell me, what's God really? If you say "the elements"—fine! But why trouble over a name?

The elements are many, impermanent, not conscious, not divine, stepped over, impure. Earth and such are not God.

Space isn't the lord—it doesn't act. Not the self—that was refuted. And if the creatorship of the unthinkable is also unthinkable—what's to say?

What's made by illusion and what's made by causes—investigate where it comes from, where it goes.

What's seen in something's presence and not in its absence—like a reflection—how can the artificial be real?

**There's no cessation and no arising. Therefore all this world is unborn and unceased.**

The movements of saṃsāra are like a dream. Investigated, they're like a plantain tree.⁶ In truth, there's no difference between those passed beyond sorrow and those not.

---

## The Compassionate Question

With all phenomena empty like this—what's gained? What's lost? By whom will honor or contempt be received?

Where's happiness? Where's suffering? What's liked? What's disliked? That craving—when sought in its nature—what is it?

Looking closely, what world of the living exists? Who dies here? What becomes? What was? Who's a relative? Who's a friend?

May those like me understand: all is like space! People get angry, they rejoice—through causes of conflict and celebration.

Moments are hard to find. The arising of a Buddha is extremely rare. The flood of afflictions is hard to stop. Alas, the succession of sufferings!

Those extremely pitiable ones, dwelling in the flood of suffering, who don't see their own distress even though so extremely distressed!

**When shall I bring peace to those tormented by the fire of suffering, through my own resources of happiness arising from clouds of merit?**

**When shall I teach emptiness to those who grasp at things, while carefully accumulating merit through conventionalities of not-grasping?**⁷

# Endnotes

¹ The five preceding perfections were preparation for wisdom.

² *Saṃvṛti* (conventional) and *paramārtha* (ultimate)—the two truths. Conventional truth is how things appear to ordinary perception; ultimate truth is how they actually are when analyzed. Both are valid within their own domains.

³ Yogins see bodies as impure; ordinary people don't. This isn't pessimism—it's seeing what's actually there instead of what attraction projects onto it.

⁴ "Like mistaking a post for a person"—*stambhe puruṣabuddhivat*. The body is conceptual, a label applied to an arrangement of parts. Remove the parts, and what's left?

⁵ *Prakṛtyā parinirvṛtāḥ*: "By nature beyond sorrow." This is the radical claim—beings aren't on their way to liberation; they're already liberated in their nature. We just haven't noticed.

⁵ᵃ **The Search for Self (vv. 59-90 expanded)**: Śāntideva systematically searches for the "I" in consciousness. Key arguments:
- **Hearing isn't the hearer**: The consciousness that perceives a sound isn't identical to "you." When the sound ends, where did "you" go?
- **Consciousness requires objects**: Unlike a soul that could exist independently, Buddhist *vijñāna* (consciousness) is always *of* something. No free-floating awareness.
- **Mind watching mind**: If the mind could observe itself directly, it would be like the eye seeing itself—impossible without a mirror (another mind).
- **Against the Sāṃkhya**: Their *prakṛti* (primal nature) is refuted because an eternal, unchanging cause can't produce changing effects.
- **Against atomism**: Eternal atoms combining to form temporary objects contradicts the claimed eternality.
- **The conclusion**: Since the self isn't found in body, senses, or consciousness, and it isn't found *outside* them, and it isn't a mixture—"it is nothing at all."

⁶ *Kadalīstambha*: The plantain tree has no core. Peel away each layer and you find... more layers, then nothing. The self is like this.

⁷ Balancing emptiness with conventional practice. The bodhisattva teaches *śūnyatā* to free beings from grasping while still accumulating merit through conventional means. This is the "two truths in action."

## Theological Notes

- **The Big Empty**: *Śūnyatā* (emptiness) isn't about nothingness—it's about freedom. It's the realization that the "I" we defend so fiercely is just a ghost story we tell ourselves.

- **No Ghost in the Machine**: The detailed analysis of the body and mind (vv. 37–59) deconstructs the self entirely. In the Blues, we know this body is "meat and bone," not who we really are.

- **Two Truths**: The balance between the Ultimate (nothing exists) and the Conventional (suffering feels real) is the tightrope the Bodhisattva walks. We know it's a dream, but we still help the dreamers.

- **Compassion in a Vacuum**: If nobody exists, who do we save? "The effort comes from delusion" (v. 47). We use the illusion of self to save the illusion of others, until the illusion dissolves.

- **The Mind-Only Trap (Cittamātra)**: Verses 15–30 attack the idea that while the world is fake, the "Mind" is real (Yogācāra view). Śāntideva argues this is just a halfway house to freedom. If you say the Mind is "self-illuminating" (like a lamp that lights itself), you're sneaking the Self back in.
    - *The Sword Argument:* A sword cannot cut itself; a finger cannot touch its own tip; the mind cannot "see" itself.
    - *The Blues Verdict:* You can't have a "real" dreamer in a "fake" dream. Both have to go. "If the illusion is nothing, then the one seeing it is nothing too."

- **Saturday Night vs. Sunday Morning (The Lotus Connection)**: If the *Lotus Sutra* is the "Gospel" service (Radical Affirmation, Big Promises, the Eternal Father), this chapter is the "Delta Blues" (Radical Negation, the empty house, the lone guitar).
    - The *Lotus* gives us the **Heart** (the vow to save everyone).
    - *Chapter 9* gives us the **Head** (the wisdom to know there's no "me" doing the saving).
    - We need both: The *Lotus* gets you out of bed; *Śāntideva* keeps you from getting an ego trip while you do the work.
