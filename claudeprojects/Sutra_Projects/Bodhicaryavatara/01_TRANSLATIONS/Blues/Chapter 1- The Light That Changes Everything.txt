Chapter 1: The Light That Changes Everything

Bodhicittānuśaṃsaḥ — The Blessings of the Waking-Up Mind

A Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

Opening: A Humble Man's Prayer

Now before I say anything at all, let me bow down low—down to the ground—to all those who walked this road before me and made it home.¹ To their children who followed in their footsteps. To the truth itself that lives in them. To everyone who ever earned respect by living right.

What I'm about to tell you is how you enter into that same discipline² they lived by—how you become one of their people.

And let me be honest with you right from the start: I ain't got nothing new to say here. I'm no great writer, no fancy wordsmith. I didn't write this down for anybody else—I wrote it to get my own heart right.³ But if it helps me find my way, and if someone like me happens to read it and it helps them too, well then, that's a blessing on top of a blessing.

---

The Moment You Got

Friends, let me talk to you about this moment you're standing in.

You know how hard it was to get here? To have a mind that can think, a heart that can feel, a chance to actually do something with this life? This right here—this moment—is rarer than you know.⁴ It's like winning a lottery you didn't even know you'd entered.

And if you don't use it? If you just let it slip by without doing the work? 

Tell me—when you think you gonna get this chance again?

It's like this: imagine the darkest night you ever seen. Clouds so thick you can't even see your own hand. And then—flash—lightning cracks the sky and for one split second you can see everything.⁵ That's what it's like when the truth touches your mind. For one instant, you can see which way to go. But then it's dark again.

See, the thing is, doing right is always weak in us. It's always struggling, always fragile. But the wrong in us? That's strong. That's been building up for lifetimes, and it's got deep roots.⁶

So what can beat it? What can turn all that darkness around?

Only one thing. Only that waking-up mind.⁷

---

The Jewel That Transforms

The wise ones—the ones who saw clear for countless ages⁸—they looked at everything, turned it over and over, and they all came to the same conclusion: this is the thing. This waking-up mind is what works.

Why? Because once it takes hold, happiness starts growing easy, effortless, and it keeps growing until it overflows and floods the whole world with joy.

Listen to me now:

If you want to get through the hundred kinds of suffering this world throws at you—don't let go of this mind.

If you want to take the suffering off other people's backs—don't let go of this mind.

If you want to taste real happiness, the kind that doesn't run out—don't ever let go of this mind.⁹

Picture somebody chained up, stuck walking circles in the same prison yard, day after day, year after year. That's us in this world of going-round-and-round.¹⁰ But the moment—the instant—that waking-up mind rises in your heart? 

You become royalty. Child of those who made it home. Heaven and earth bow down to you.¹¹

It's like alchemy.¹² You take this dirty, broken-down body of yours—this thing made of mess and pain—and the waking-up mind touches it, and suddenly it's precious. It's a temple. It's gold.

So hold on tight to this elixir.

The caravan leaders who guide people through dangerous country—the ones who've scouted every path and know which ones lead home—they've tested this thing and found it true.¹³ If you've been wandering from stop to stop all your life, never quite arriving, then grab hold of this jewel.

Most good things you do? They're like the banana tree—bear fruit once and then they're done, used up, gone.¹⁴ But the tree of the waking-up mind? It bears fruit and keeps bearing fruit. Never runs dry. Only gets stronger.

Even if you've done terrible things—I mean terrible things—this mind can carry you over that, quick as a hero pulls you out of danger.¹⁵ So why in the world wouldn't you reach for it?

It burns up your wrongdoing like the fire at the end of the age.¹⁶ Maitreya himself—the great one who's coming—told young Sudhana all about this, how many blessings it brings.¹⁷

---

Two Ways to Wake Up

Now, there's two kinds of this waking-up mind, and you ought to know the difference.¹⁸

First there's the wishing kind: you see the road, you want to walk it, you say "I'm gonna get there and I'm gonna bring everybody with me."

Then there's the walking kind: you actually step onto that road and start moving.

Think of it this way: one person says "I sure would like to go to Memphis." That's wishing.

Another person gets in the car and drives. That's walking.

Both matter. The wish is powerful—even just wishing to wake up for everybody's sake, that's a beautiful thing, and it bears fruit. But the one who's actually moving? That's something else entirely.

Because once you really commit—I mean really commit, with your whole heart, saying "I will not stop until every single being is free"¹⁹—from that moment on, even when you're asleep, even when you're not paying attention, blessings flow out of you like rivers that never run dry, wide as the sky itself.²⁰

The Buddha himself said so. You can look it up.²¹

---

Greater Than You Know

Let me try to show you how big this thing is.

Say somebody wakes up one morning thinking "You know what, I'm gonna help people with their headaches today."²² Just that thought—that simple intention—brings more good into their life than they could ever count.

So what about someone who says "I want to take away every kind of suffering from every single being, and give every single one of them more good than they can hold"?²³ You can't even measure that.

What mother loves like that? What father? What god in heaven, what angel, what sage ever had that kind of heart?²⁴

Those very people you'd be helping—they don't even wish this good for themselves, not in their wildest dreams!²⁵ How could they ask for it from someone else?

And here comes this rare being—this jewel among people—who wants for others what nobody even wants for themselves.²⁶

How do you measure the worth of such a heart? It's the seed of all the world's joy, the medicine for all the world's pain.²⁷

Just by wishing well for others, you're doing something greater than any offering you could bring to any altar. And if you actually get up and work for everybody's happiness?²⁸

Lord have mercy.

The Tragedy of Running the Wrong Way

See, here's the sad truth about most folks:

They're trying to run from suffering—but they're running straight toward it.²⁹ They're chasing after happiness—and in their confusion, they're destroying the very happiness they're after, like it was their enemy.

That's the human condition, friend. That's the blues we all got.

But then there's another kind of person—the kind who looks at all these desperate, suffering, starving-for-happiness people and says: "I'm gonna fill them up. I'm gonna cut off what hurts them. And I'm gonna break the very confusion that keeps them running in circles."³⁰

Where you gonna find another friend like that?

Where you gonna find another good like that?

Sure, we praise people who pay back a favor. But the bodhisattva? They ain't waiting to be asked. They ain't keeping score. They help without being prompted, love without conditions.³¹

What can you even say about somebody like that?

---

The Great Feast

Think about a person who feeds a few hungry folks.³² Gives them a meal, maybe keeps them going for half a day. Even if they're a little condescending about it—people still say, "That person did a good thing."

Now think about somebody who could feed everybody—for all time—not just food for the belly, but everything the heart could ever want.³³ Not for a day, but forever. Not for a few people, but for as many people as there is sky.

That's the bodhisattva's gift.

And the Master says: anybody who harbors hatred in their heart against such a one—they're gonna suffer for it, long and hard.³⁴

But if your heart opens to them in faith? The blessings just pour in, even without effort.³⁵ Because it's easy to do good toward such people—the hard thing is doing wrong.

---

Going Home

So here I am, bowing down to the very bodies of those people in whom this jewel-mind has risen.³⁶

Because even when you hurt them? That hurt turns into blessing.

They're the ones who make everything come out good.

I go to them. I take refuge. I go home.

 Theological Notes

- Bodhicitta as Central: This chapter establishes the waking-up mind as the single most important factor in spiritual development—more powerful than any other virtue.

- Transformation, Not Escape: The Blues perspective reinforces that we don't abandon this broken world; bodhicitta transforms it. The body becomes gold, prison becomes palace.

- Community of Travelers: Śāntideva writes for fellow strugglers, not from a position of mastery. This humility is deeply resonant with Blues testimony.

- The Paradox of Self-Harm: Verse 28's observation—running toward what hurts us—is perhaps the most Blues-authentic moment in the chapter. We all know this trouble.


 Chapter 2: Laying My Burden Down

 Pāpadeśanā — The Confession

A Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim

---

 Bringing Everything I Got

Before I can take hold of that precious waking-up mind—that jewel I been telling you about—I got to come correct.¹ I got to bring something to the table.

So here I am, laying my offerings before the ones who made it home, before the truth itself, before all their children who walk that same road.

And Lord, what have I got to give?

I'm bringing every flower that ever bloomed, every fruit that ever hung heavy on the branch. Every healing herb that grows wild. Every jewel buried deep in the earth. Every clear, sweet water running down the mountain.²

Mountains themselves—made of precious stone. Those quiet forest places where a soul can be alone. Vines covered in blossoms like they're dressed for church. Trees bowing down with good fruit.

Up in the higher realms—incense rising, wish-granting trees, lakes covered in lotuses where the swans call out sweet.³

And the crops that spring up on their own, with nobody planting them—everything beautiful that exists, all the way to the edges of space—none of it belongs to anybody anyway.

I'm gathering all of it in my mind, and I'm handing it over to the great ones and their children. Please, y'all. Take it from me. I know you feel for me. Have mercy and accept what I'm offering.⁴

Because truth be told? I'm broke. Spiritually bankrupt.⁵ I ain't got nothing else. So take this, whatever it is, for my sake. You're the ones who care about folks like me. Accept it by your own power, because mine ain't enough.

---

 I Give Myself

And you know what? Here's the real offering.

I give myself.⁶

All of me. Every bit. To the Victors. To their children. Whatever I am, whatever I got, it's yours now.

Take me in. I'm coming to work for you. Not because I have to—but because when you own me like this, I ain't scared no more. I'm free to help people. I can step over all the wrong I done before.⁷ And I won't be doing that no more.

---

 Washing Their Feet

Now let me tell you how I want to honor them.

Picture a bathhouse—floors of crystal so clean they shine, canopy overhead glittering with pearls, pillars made of gems that catch the light.⁸ The whole place smelling like something holy.

I'm pouring water from jeweled vessels, water full of flowers and sweet fragrance. I'm bathing the great ones and their children, and there's music playing, songs rising.

I dry them off with the finest cloths—spotless, perfumed. Then I dress them in robes dyed in deep colors, scented just right.⁹

I'm dressing up Samantabhadra and Mañjuśrī and Avalokiteśvara—the ones who made it—in the softest fabric, hung with the finest jewelry.¹⁰

I'm anointing their bodies with perfume that spreads across a billion worlds. Their skin shines like polished gold.

I'm covering them with flowers—māndārava blossoms from heaven, blue lotuses, jasmine—everything sweet and beautiful I can find.¹¹ Incense clouds rising around them. And I'm laying out food and drink, everything good.

I'm setting out lamps on golden lotuses, scattering more flowers on the perfumed floors.

I'm offering palaces radiant with pearls, ringing with praise-songs.

I'm holding jeweled parasols over their heads.

May clouds of offerings keep rising forever—music, instruments, everything that gladdens the heart. May flowers and jewels rain down on every holy place without end.¹²

---

 Following in Their Steps

Just like Mañjughoṣa and the others worship the ones who made it home—that's how I'm worshipping too.¹³

With an ocean of my voice, I praise these oceans of virtue.

I bow down as many times as there are atoms in every buddha-field—to all the awakened ones past, present, and future. To the truth. To the community.

I venerate every holy shrine, every place where bodhisattvas dwell.

I bow to my teachers.

I bow to every practitioner worthy of respect.

---

 I Go for Refuge

And now I go.¹⁴

I go for refuge to the Buddha—all the way till I'm sitting under that tree myself.

I go for refuge to the Dharma.

I go for refuge to the bodhisattvas, all of them.

And standing here with my palms together, I got something to say to the awakened ones in every direction, to all the compassionate ones:

---

 My Confession

Here it is. Here's my burden.

From the very beginning—and I mean the beginning, before time had a name—in this life and all the ones before it:¹⁵

Whatever wrong I did with my own hands—I confess it.

Whatever wrong I caused somebody else to do—I confess it.

Whatever wrong I watched happen and said "Good, that's good"—fool that I was, digging my own grave—I confess it.

I'm burning with regret right now.¹⁶

Whatever I did against the Three Jewels. Whatever I did against my mother and father. Whatever I did against my teachers. Whatever contempt I showed in body, speech, and mind.

All the terrible things—done by me, a sinner heavy with faults—

I confess.¹⁷

---

 Death Is Coming

Listen now. This is the part that scares me.

How am I gonna get out of this mess? Save me quick! Because death is coming, and my account ain't settled.¹⁸

Death—that assassin who don't care whether you finished your work or not. Healthy, sick, don't matter. Death don't trust nobody and nobody should trust death. It comes down like a bolt from the sky.¹⁹

All my life, I did wrong for people I loved and people I hated. And I never stopped to think: I got to leave all of it behind. Every single person. Every single thing.

The ones I can't stand? They ain't gonna be here.
The ones I love? They ain't gonna be here.
I ain't gonna be here.
Nothing. Nothing at all.²⁰

Everything you ever felt, everything you ever touched—it fades into memory. Like something you dreamed. Gone. Never to be seen again.²¹

Right here, right now, while I'm standing in this very spot, so many loved ones have already left. So many enemies too. But the wrong I did on their account? That's still here. Right in front of me. Terrible.²²

I thought I was permanent. I thought this was my home. I forgot I was just passing through.²³ And because I forgot, I let delusion and craving and hatred run my life. And I did wrong, wrong, wrong.

Day and night, without rest, my life is draining away. There's no refill. There's nothing coming back. Am I really gonna die?²⁴

When I'm lying on that bed, even with all my people around me—the pain that cuts me to the quick? I got to bear that alone.²⁵

When death's messengers grab hold of me, where's my family gonna be? Where's my friends? All that can save me is the good I've done—and I ain't done enough.²⁶

I was attached to this fleeting life. I didn't understand the danger. And in my heedlessness, Protectors—I piled up so much wrong.

You ever see a man being led off to have his hand cut off? He goes pale. Mouth dry. Eyes wild. Seeing the world like he never saw it before.²⁷

How much worse when death's messengers got you? When you're burning with terror-fever, when you've lost control of your body?²⁸

You look around with panicked eyes—north, south, east, west—searching for somebody, anybody, who can help.

"Who's gonna save me from this?"²⁹

And you see: the directions are empty. No help anywhere. And you fall back into confusion.

What am I gonna do?³⁰

---

 Going Back to the Refuge

This very day—right now—I go for refuge.³¹

To the mighty Lords of the World.
To the Victors who work to protect us.
To the ones who take away all fear.

And to the truth they realized—the truth that kills the fear of going-round-and-round—I go for refuge with my whole heart. And to the bodhisattva community too.

Trembling, I give myself to Samantabhadra.

And again, of my own free will, I give myself to Mañjughoṣa.

And to Avalokita—that Protector whose every move is driven by compassion—I cry out loud, terrified: Protect me! I'm a sinner!³²

To Ākāśagarbha! To Kṣitigarbha!³³ To all the great compassionate ones! I'm looking everywhere for help, and I'm crying out!

I bow to the Vajra-holder—that one whose very sight makes death's messengers run screaming in four directions.³⁴

I broke your rules before. I didn't listen. But now—now I see the danger. I'm coming to you scared. Take away my fear. Do it fast.

Even somebody with a passing cold follows the doctor's orders. How much more somebody with four hundred and four diseases?³⁵

One disease can kill everybody in the world. And there's no medicine for it anywhere.

So if I ignore the words of the Doctor who knows everything, who cures everything—shame on me. Shame on me, so deep in delusion.³⁶

I'm careful at ordinary cliffs. How much more at this cliff that drops for a thousand miles, for a thousand ages?³⁷

"Death ain't coming today"—that thought is poison. Because that time is coming. The time when I will not be.

Who made me fearless? How am I gonna escape? I'm definitely gonna die. So why is my heart so calm?³⁸

All those experiences I had, the ones that are already gone—what's left of them? Nothing. But I clung to them so hard I broke every rule.³⁹

When I leave this world—leave my people, everybody I know—I go alone. Somewhere.⁴⁰ What good are any of them to me now, loved or hated?

No, my only concern, day and night, should be this: How do I get free of the suffering that's definitely coming from my wrongdoing?⁴¹

---

 The Final Words

Whatever wrong I accumulated—fool that I am, dull that I am—whether wrong by nature or wrong by rule—⁴²

All of it, I confess. Standing right here, in front of the Protectors. Palms together. Terrified of the pain to come. Bowing down again and again.⁴³

May the Leaders acknowledge my transgression as transgression.

This wasn't good, Protectors.

I won't do it again.⁴⁴

 Theological Notes

- Blues and Confession: This chapter is pure Blues territory. The confession motif—laying your burden down, admitting what you've done wrong, crying out for help—runs deep in both traditions. Śāntideva's brutal honesty about his failures resonates with the Blues practice of testimony.

- Fear as Teacher: The meditation on death (vv. 33-47) uses terror to wake us up. The Blues knows this too: trouble teaches truth.

- Crying Out: The cries to Avalokiteśvara and other protectors are not philosophical—they're desperate. This is religion at the level of the gut, not the head.

- Self-Offering: "I give myself" is the radical surrender at the heart of both Buddhist practice and the Blues surrender to truth.


# Chapter 3: Taking Hold of the Road

## Bodhicittaparigrahaḥ — Embracing the Waking-Up Mind

*A Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim*

---

## Joy in Everybody's Good

Let me start with some rejoicing.¹

Every good thing that anybody's ever done—every deed that gives relief to folks stuck in hard places—I'm clapping for that. I'm saying *yes* to that. May everyone who's hurting find some peace.

When somebody gets free from this wheel of going-round-and-round, when somebody makes it to the other shore—I'm happy for them.² When somebody becomes a bodhisattva, when somebody wakes all the way up—I celebrate.

And I rejoice in every great teacher whose heart is an ocean of that waking-up mind, who works day and night for the benefit of all.

---

## Please Don't Leave Us in the Dark

Now, with my hands pressed together, I'm calling out to all the awakened ones everywhere:

*Light the lamp.*³

There's folks out here stumbling in the dark, falling headlong into suffering because they can't see. Turn on the Dharma-light for them.

And you Victors who've done your work, who are ready to slip away into that peaceful rest—*please wait*.⁴ Don't go yet. Stay for countless ages more. Don't let this world go blind.

---

## I Give It All

So here's my dedication.⁵ Everything good I've ever done, everything good I've gathered up—I'm turning it over. May it become the thing that calms every suffering everywhere.

Let me be medicine for the sick.⁶ Let me be the doctor too. And the nurse who stays at the bedside until they're well for good.

When people are burning with hunger and thirst, let me rain down food and drink. In those terrible famine times between the ages, let me become the meal and the water myself.⁷

For folks who got nothing, let me be a treasury that never runs dry.⁸ Let me show up for them in whatever form they need.

My body, my stuff, all my good deeds from past, present, and future—I hand it all over, no strings attached.⁹ All for the sake of every living being.

And here's the truth: letting go of everything *is* peace. That's nirvana. My mind is heading that way. So if I've got to give it all up anyway, it's better to give it to living beings than to just throw it away.¹⁰

---

## Do What You Want with Me

I've made myself available for the happiness of everybody.¹¹

So go ahead: Kill me. Curse me. Throw dirt on me. I'm not going anywhere.

Play with this body of mine. Laugh at me. Make fun of me. I gave it to you already—why should I worry about it?¹²

Make me do whatever brings you joy. Just let no harm come to anybody through me.¹³

If your dealings with me—whether you're mad at me or pleased with me—if they always lead to your success, that's good enough for me.¹⁴

Those who spread lies about me, those who hurt me, those who make sport of me—may every last one of them share in awakening.¹⁵

## I'll Be Everything You Need

Let me be a protector for the unprotected.¹⁶
A guide for travelers.
A boat for those who want to cross the water.
A bridge.
A road.

Let me be a lamp for those who need light.¹⁷
A bed for those who need rest.
A servant for anyone who needs one.

Let me be a wish-granting jewel.¹⁸ An overflowing vessel. A healing spell. A medicine that cures everything. A tree that gives you whatever you ask for. A cow that pours out endless milk.¹⁹

The elements—earth, water, fire, air, space—they serve everybody in countless ways, all the way to the edges of existence.²⁰

Let me be like that: a source of sustenance for every being, in every way they need, until every last one of them is at peace.²¹

---

## This Is My Vow

Here it is. The formal commitment.²²

The way the old Sugatas took hold of this waking-up mind—the way they trained, step by step, in the bodhisattva path—

*That's what I'm doing now.*²³

I generate bodhicitta for the good of the world. And I will train in those same practices, one after another, just like they did.

---

## Celebrating What Just Happened

Now that I've got hold of this thing—now that I've really taken it up with my whole heart—let me gladden my spirit by saying this:²⁴

*Today my birth has become worthwhile.*²⁵

This human life has earned its keep.
Today I was born into the Buddha family.
Now—right now—I'm a child of the Buddhas.

From here on out, I got to act like somebody who belongs to this family.²⁶ I can't disgrace my people. This lineage has got to stay clean.

I'm like a blind man who found a diamond in a garbage heap.²⁷ How in the world did this bodhicitta arise in someone like me?

This is the elixir that destroys the death of the world.²⁸ This is the inexhaustible treasury that ends the world's poverty.

This is the supreme medicine that heals the world's disease.²⁹ This is the shade tree where folks exhausted from walking the roads of existence can rest.

This is the public bridge for everyone crossing out of the hard places.³⁰ This is the moon of the mind, rising to cool the world's afflictions.

This is the great sun that burns away the world's night of ignorance.³¹ This is the fresh butter that comes from churning the milk of the true teaching.

---

## The Feast Is Ready

For the caravan of travelers walking the roads of existence—all of you who are hungry and thirsty for some happiness—the feast is ready.³² 

Come and eat. There's enough for everyone who shows up.

Today, right here, in front of all the Protectors, I'm inviting the whole world: Come to awakening! And on the way, be happy!³³

Gods, demons, and everybody else—*rejoice!*

---

*Here ends the third chapter, "Taking Hold of the Road"—the formal embrace of the waking-up mind. May taking hold give us strength for the journey.*

## Theological Notes

- **The Vow**: This chapter contains the formal liturgical generation of bodhicitta. Blues interpretation maintains the ceremonial weight while making it feel personal and immediate.

- **Radical Self-Offering**: Verses 12–16 take the confession of Chapter 2 and transform it into positive commitment. "Do what you want with me"—the Blues knows this surrender.

- **Becoming Everything**: The aspiration to be lamp, bed, bridge, boat, medicine—this is universal service without conditions.

- **Celebration**: The exultation "Today my birth has become worthwhile!" is the Blues moment of breakthrough—when the long road finally leads somewhere.

# Chapter 4: Don't Let Your Guard Down

## Bodhicittāpramādaḥ — Keeping Watch on the Waking-Up Mind

*A Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim*

---

## You Made a Promise

Now listen here. You took hold of that waking-up mind, didn't you? You said you were going to do this thing.¹

A child of the Victors doesn't slack off. Doesn't get lazy. Doesn't break what they promised.

Sure, if you jumped into something without thinking—just said it hastily—then you can reconsider. That's fair.² But this? This has been examined by the Buddhas. Examined by their wise children. And I examined it too, best I could. So why am I stalling?³

If I promised and then don't deliver, I'm a liar. I've deceived everyone.⁴ And where does that leave me?

The scriptures say that if you even *think* about giving something and then don't, you end up a hungry ghost. And that's for little things.⁵

What about me? I stood up and announced to the whole world: supreme happiness is coming! I proclaimed it loud! Now if I don't follow through—*what becomes of me?*⁶

---

## The Weight of What You Carry

The thing is, even if you fall—even if you abandon this waking-up mind—the All-Knowing One eventually saves you anyway.⁷ That's how deep the compassion runs.

But that doesn't make falling light. Every stumble a bodhisattva makes is serious. Real serious. Because when you fall, you're dragging down all the beings you promised to help.⁸

And if anybody gets in the way of your merit, even for a second—they're making an enemy of everybody everywhere. That person's gonna fall a long, long way.⁹

Destroy the welfare of one being, you're destroyed. What about destroying the welfare of all beings, from here to the edges of space?¹⁰

So here you are, swinging back and forth—the power of your falls pulling you down, the power of bodhicitta lifting you up—delayed on the road forever.¹¹

---

## Today Is All You Got

So do what you said. Do it with everything you got. If you don't make the effort *today*, you're sinking from depth to depth.¹²

Countless Buddhas have come and gone. They were looking for everybody, trying to heal everybody. And my own faults kept me out of reach. I never got the medicine.¹³

If I stay the same way I've always been, I'll just keep cycling through the lower realms—sickness, death, being cut up, broken apart, again and again.¹⁴

When am I ever going to get this again?¹⁵ A Buddha appearing in the world. Faith. Human birth. And being in a condition where I can actually practice virtue. This is so rare.

And look—today you're healthy. You got food. Nothing terrible is happening right now. But life is a split second.¹⁶ It's deceiving you. This body you're in? It's borrowed.

If I keep acting like I've been acting, I won't get human birth again. And without that, there's no virtue. Only wrong.¹⁷

When I'm fit to practice virtue and I *don't*—what am I gonna do when I'm bewildered by the suffering of the lower realms?¹⁸

If I don't do good, and I pile up wrong, the word "higher rebirth" is dead for millions of years.¹⁹

That's why the Blessed One said human life is as rare as a blind turtle sticking its neck through a yoke floating on the ocean.²⁰

One moment of evil puts you in the lowest hell for an eon.²¹ And I've been piling up evil since before time had a name. Higher rebirth? Don't even talk about it.

And here's the worst part: even when you're burning in that fire, you're not getting purified. You're breeding more wrong, because the suffering makes you angry, desperate, confused.²² It just keeps going.

There's no bigger deception than this. No bigger fool than me. I got this moment, this chance, and I'm not practicing virtue.²³

---

## The Fire That's Coming

If I think about all this and still fall back into confusion—the messengers of Yama are gonna torment me for a long, long time.²⁴

Hell-fire is gonna burn this body. And the fire of regret is gonna burn my untrained mind.²⁵ Both fires. For a long, long time.

Somehow—somehow—I made it to this beneficial ground. So hard to reach. And I know what I'm doing, but I'm being led right back to those same hells.²⁶

What's wrong with me? I have no will of my own. It's like I'm under a spell.²⁷ I don't know what's confusing me.

*Who is it that lives inside me?*

---

## Know Your Enemy

Think about it: craving, aversion, delusion—these enemies of mine—they got no hands.²⁸ No feet. They ain't brave. They ain't smart.

So how did they make me a slave?

They're stationed right in my own mind, hitting me whenever they want, comfortable as can be. And I don't even get angry about it!²⁹ Shame on my misplaced patience!

If every god and every human being were my enemies, they couldn't drag me to the fires of the lowest hell.³⁰

But these enemies—the afflictions—they throw me there in a second. They're so powerful that if Mount Meru itself met that fire, there wouldn't even be ashes left.³¹

No other enemy lives this long. My affliction-enemies have been with me since before the beginning. They'll be with me till the end.³² That's a long, long war.

And here's the thing: every other enemy, if you treat them right, might help you out.³³ But these afflictions? The more you serve them, the worse it gets.

So tell me: while these constant, long-lasting enemies—sole causes of every misfortune—are living in my heart, how am I supposed to enjoy life without fear?³⁴

These are the jailers of existence. The executioners in hell. If they're living in the cage of craving inside my mental home—*where is my happiness?*³⁵

---

## Time to Fight

Alright then.³⁶ I'm not laying this burden down until these enemies are dead in front of me.

You know how prideful folks are? They can't even sleep until they've dealt with somebody who offended them over something small.

Meanwhile, soldiers on the battlefield—fighting enemies who are gonna die anyway—charge into arrows and spears.³⁷ They don't turn back, no matter the pain.

So why should I get depressed?³⁸ Why should I be discouraged? My enemies are the constant causes of all suffering. Even if I get knocked down a hundred times, I keep getting up.

People wear their battle scars like jewelry.³⁹ So why should hardship bother me when I'm after something this big?

Fishermen, outcasts, farmers—they endure cold and heat just to survive.⁴⁰ Why can't I endure for the sake of the whole world?

I vowed to free beings from affliction all the way to the edges of space—and I haven't even freed myself!⁴¹ 

When I made that vow without knowing my own limits—was I crazy?⁴² Maybe. But that means I can never, ever turn back from destroying these afflictions. Not now. Not ever.

---

## The Final Vow

In this fight, I'll be ruthless.⁴³ Bound in enmity. At war. Except for the one "affliction" that destroys afflictions—that one I'll keep.

Let my guts spill out.⁴⁴ Let my head fall off. But I will *never* bow down to these enemies.

An ordinary enemy, if you exile him, might find a foothold somewhere else, gather his strength, and come back.⁴⁵ But the afflictions ain't like that. Once they're really expelled from the mind—where are they gonna go?

Driven out of my mind, where would they stay?⁴⁶ Where would they plot against me? The truth is, I just haven't made the effort. These afflictions are pathetic. They're conquered through the eye of wisdom.

Listen now, this is important:⁴⁷

The afflictions don't live in sense objects. They don't live in the sense faculties. They don't live in between. They don't live anywhere else either. So where do they live, these things that torment the whole world?

*It's all illusion.*

So let go of fear. Cultivate effort for wisdom. Why are you torturing yourself in hell for no reason?

Having figured all this out, I'm making the effort.⁴⁸ I'm practicing the trainings that were taught. Because how is a sick man gonna get well if he ignores the doctor's orders?

---

*Here ends the fourth chapter, "Don't Let Your Guard Down"—on keeping vigilant over the waking-up mind. May we never fall asleep.*

## Theological Notes

- **The Inner War**: This chapter transforms spiritual life into warfare against the afflictions. The Blues tradition knows about fighting—fighting the bottle, fighting despair, fighting the man. Śāntideva says: the only fight that matters is inside.

- **The Mystery of Bondage**: "Who is it that dwells within me?" This question is the heart of the chapter. We're enslaved by enemies we can't even identify.

- **Illusion as Liberation**: The key insight comes in verse 47—afflictions have no true location, no real substance. They're illusion. The Blues knows this too: sometimes the thing you've been fighting ain't even real.

# Chapter 5: Keep Watch on Your Mind

## Saṃprajanyarakṣaṇam — Guarding Clear Awareness

*A Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim*

---

## It's All About the Mind

You want to keep the training? Then keep the mind.¹ Can't do one without the other. A wandering mind can't hold onto anything.

An elephant gone wild can wreck a village. But that's nothing compared to what the wild elephant of your mind can do—it'll drag you straight to hell.²

But if you tie that elephant up with the rope of mindfulness, wrap it around him on all sides—fear goes away. And everything good comes close.³

Tigers, lions, bears, snakes, enemies of every kind, the jailers of hell, demons and evil spirits⁴—*all of them* are bound when you bind the one mind. *All of them* are tamed when you tame the one mind.

That's what the Teacher of Truth said: all fear, all suffering without limit—it comes from the mind.⁵

Think about it: who forged all those weapons in hell? Who heated up that iron floor? Where did all those tormentors come from?⁶

The Sage said: it all comes from the sinful mind. There's nothing scarier in all the worlds than the mind.

---

## The Sandal Wisdom

Now here's something that'll change how you think.

If the perfection of generosity meant making the whole world rich, then how did the old masters perfect it?⁷ The world's still poor.

No—the perfection of generosity is the *mind* of giving everything away.⁸ That's why it's called a perfection. It's the mind.

Same with ethics. Where am I supposed to lead all the fish so I don't kill them?⁹ Impossible. But when the mind of renunciation is obtained—*that's* the perfection.

How many wicked people can I kill? They're countless as the sky.¹⁰ But when I kill the mind of anger—all enemies are dead.

Here's my favorite: where am I gonna find enough leather to cover the whole earth?¹¹ There's not enough leather in the world.

But with just enough leather for the bottom of my sandals—the whole earth is covered.

Same with everything else. I can't control what's out there. But I *can* control what's in here.¹² And once I do that, what else needs controlling?

All your recitations, all your austerities, all your spiritual exercises—if the mind is elsewhere, it's pointless.¹³ The All-Knowing One said so.

The mind is the secret essence of all Dharma.¹⁴ People wander through space trying to escape suffering and find happiness, but they never cultivated this one thing.

So I'm gonna keep my mind well-placed. The vow to guard the mind—that's the only vow I need.¹⁵

---

## Mindfulness and Clear Seeing

You know how in a rough crowd you'd protect an open wound?¹⁶ Careful not to let anybody bump it?

That's how you protect the wound of the mind when you're around bad company.

I'm scared of a little pain from a cut, so I'm careful. Why wouldn't I be careful about the wound of the mind—when what's at stake is the crushing mountains of hell?¹⁷

Live like this, and you can walk among the wicked. You can walk among beautiful, seductive people. The steadfast practitioner doesn't break.¹⁸

Let gains be lost. Let honor be lost. Let this body go. Let other virtues go. *But never let the mind go.*¹⁹

I'm begging you—if you want to guard the mind, guard mindfulness and clear seeing.²⁰ Guard them with everything you've got.

Somebody sick with a disease can't work. Same thing: a mind without these two can't do anything.²¹

Everything you learned, everything you thought about, everything you meditated on—it drains away like water from a cracked pot if you're not paying attention.²²

Even the learned, even the faithful, even the diligent—without clear seeing, they fall.²³

There's a robber called Non-Attention, and he follows after the theft of mindfulness.²⁴ He'll steal all your merit and send you straight to the lower realms.

The affliction gang is looking for an opening.²⁵ The moment they get in, they rob you blind and kill your chance at a higher life.

So don't ever let mindfulness leave the door of the mind.²⁶ And if it does leave, bring it back by remembering what's waiting in the lower realms.

If you're lucky enough to have a teacher, if you're respectful, if you've got some fear—mindfulness comes easy.²⁷

The Buddhas and bodhisattvas see everywhere.²⁸ Everything is in front of them. I'm standing right in front of them.

Think about that. Stay modest. Stay respectful. Stay a little scared. Remembrance of Buddha will come again and again.

When mindfulness stands guard at the door of the mind, then clear seeing arrives.²⁹ And once it comes, it doesn't leave.

---

## Like a Log

First thing: keep the mind ready.³⁰ Think to yourself: "I'm gonna stay like I have no senses. Like a log."

Don't go throwing your eyes around.³¹ Keep the gaze down, like you're meditating. Sometimes you can look at the horizon to rest your eyes. If you see somebody, acknowledge them. But that's it.

On the road, look around for danger.³² Stop and look behind you. Before going forward or back, check where you're going. In every situation, know what you're doing before you do it.

Fix the body in position, then check midway through: "How's the body doing?"³³

With all your effort, watch whether the mind-elephant is tied to the pillar of Dharma meditation.³⁴

Ask yourself again and again: "Where is my mind right now?"³⁵ Don't let go of concentration even for a moment.

If there's celebration or danger and you can't maintain this, that's okay—do what you need to do.³⁶

But whatever task you take up, stick with it.³⁷ Don't jump to something else. Finish what you started, with your whole self in it. Otherwise nothing gets done, and non-attention grows stronger.

When curiosity arises about gossip and entertainment—destroy it.³⁸

When you find yourself playing with dirt, tearing grass, drawing meaningless lines—remember the training.³⁹ Quit immediately, with fear.

Before you move, before you speak, examine the mind.⁴⁰ Then act with steadiness.

And here's the key:⁴¹

**When you see your mind is attached or hostile—don't act. Don't speak. Stay like a log.**

When the mind is arrogant, mocking, full of pride, deceptive, making a show⁴²—*like a log.*

When it's comparing itself to others, feeling contentious, getting aggressive⁴³—*like a log.*

When it's chasing gain, honor, reputation, followers, service⁴⁴—*like a log.*

When it's indifferent to others, just out for itself, wanting to show off in a crowd⁴⁵—*like a log.*

When it's impatient, lazy, scared, impudent, running its mouth, attached to its own side⁴⁶—*like a log.*

Whenever you see the mind afflicted or chasing pointless activity, the warrior restrains it.⁴⁷ Hard. With the antidote.

---

## The Good Mind

Here's what to cultivate instead:⁴⁸

Determined. Serene. Steady. Respectful. Modest. A little fearful of wrong. Peaceful. Eager to please others.

Don't get worn out by childish people's conflicting desires.⁴⁹ Have compassion—know that their confusion comes from affliction.

Hold the mind under your power, directed toward blameless things, like a magical creation, without ego.⁵⁰

Remember again and again: you waited so long for this excellent moment.⁵¹ Hold the mind immovable, like Mount Meru.

---

## What's the Body Anyway?

When vultures fight over a corpse, dragging it here and there, the body doesn't resist.⁵² So why are you going to such trouble for its sake?

Hey, mind—why do you guard this body like it belongs to you?⁵³ Why do you get all proud about it? If it's separate from you, what do you lose by letting it go?

You fool—you won't even take a *clean* wooden doll as your own.⁵⁴ So why do you protect this stinking machine made of filth?

Go ahead—separate the skin bag with your own understanding.⁵⁵ Use the sword of wisdom to cut the flesh from the bones.

Separate the bones. Look at the marrow inside.⁵⁶ Now ask yourself: "What's the essence here?"

After all that searching, you haven't found any essence.⁵⁷ So tell me—why are you still protecting this body?

You can't eat the flesh (it's impure). You can't drink the blood. You can't suck the guts.⁵⁸ What exactly are you going to do with it?

It's fitting to keep it as vulture-food and jackal-food.⁵⁹ But this body of a human being—it's a tool for work. That's what it's good for.

Even as you guard it, pitiless death will snatch it and throw it to the vultures.⁶⁰ What will you do then?

You don't give expensive clothes to a servant who won't stay.⁶¹ The body's gonna eat and leave. Why are you spending so much on it?

Give it wages, sure—then attend to your own welfare.⁶² Not everything the worker earns should go to the worker.

Think of the body as a boat.⁶³ It goes places. Use it for traveling—send it wherever it needs to go for the welfare of beings.

---

## How to Live Every Day

Once you've mastered yourself, always have a smiling face.⁶⁴ Give up frowning. Be the first to speak. Be a friend to the world.

Don't throw things down with a crash.⁶⁵ Don't slam doors. Love silence.

The heron, the cat, and the thief—they move silent and unseen, and they get what they want.⁶⁶ Move like that.

Accept instruction from those who help without being asked.⁶⁷ Be everyone's student.

Say "Well done!" when something is well done.⁶⁸ Praise people who do good.

Talk about others' good qualities behind their back.⁶⁹ When someone praises you, reflect that they appreciate goodness itself.

Everything we do is for satisfaction—and it's hard to buy.⁷⁰ So enjoy the satisfaction of other people's virtues. It costs nothing here and brings great happiness later.

Speak with trustworthy words, clear meaning, pleasant to hear, rooted in compassion, soft and gentle.⁷¹

Look at beings straight on, like you're drinking them in with your eyes.⁷² Think: "These are the ones who will carry me to awakening."

Be skillful. Be diligent. Do things yourself.⁷³ Don't give anybody an opening in any task.

The perfections go in order—generosity, ethics, patience, and up.⁷⁴ Don't abandon a higher one for a lower one, except for the sake of good conduct.

Once you understand, stay engaged in others' welfare.⁷⁵ For the compassionate who see the benefit, even what's technically forbidden becomes permitted.

Share your food with the fallen, the unprotected, those under vows.⁷⁶ Eat moderately. Give away everything but the three robes.

Don't push the body around for trivial reasons when it serves the true teaching.⁷⁷ That way you fulfill the hopes of beings quickly.

---

## Study the Teachings

The conduct of bodhisattvas is immeasurable.⁷⁸ At minimum, practice purifying the mind.

Three times by day and three times by night, recite the Three Sections.⁷⁹ Through bodhicitta and the Victors, downfalls are pacified.

Whatever situation you're in—whether you put yourself there or someone else did—train in the trainings that fit that situation.⁸⁰

There's nothing the children of the Victors shouldn't train in.⁸¹ For one living like this, there's nothing that isn't merit.

Everything you do, directly or indirectly, should be for beings' welfare.⁸² And for beings' sake, dedicate everything to awakening.

Never abandon your spiritual friend, even at the cost of your life—the one who holds the bodhisattva vow and knows the Mahāyāna.⁸³

Learn how to serve the teacher from the Śrīsaṃbhava chapter.⁸⁴ Learn the rest from reading the sutras.

The trainings are in the sutras—so read them.⁸⁵ Check the root downfalls in the Ākāśagarbha Sutra.

Study the *Śikṣāsamuccaya* again and again.⁸⁶ It shows daily conduct in detail.

Or at least check the *Sūtrasamuccaya* and Nāgārjuna's other work.⁸⁷

From these, see what's forbidden and what's required.⁸⁸ Practice the training to protect the mind of worldly beings.

# Chapter 6: When the World Treats You Wrong

## Kṣāntipāramitā — The Perfection of Patience

*A Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim*

---

## I. Anger Burns It All Down

Listen to me now. This is serious.¹

All that good you've done—the giving, the worship, the practice—everything built up over thousands of lifetimes? One flash of anger burns it to ash.

There's no evil like hatred. And there's no austerity like patience.² So learn patience. Work at it. Find every way you can.

When that thorn of hatred is stuck in your heart,³ the mind can't rest. Can't find peace. Can't feel pleasure. Can't sleep. Can't hold steady.

Even the people you've helped—the ones who depend on you, the ones you've treated right—even *they* want to see you dead when you're eaten up with anger. Your friends pull away. You give, but nobody serves you.

Bottom line: there's nothing—*nothing*—that goes right for the angry man.

So the one who destroys anger, who keeps at it without giving up? That one is happy here. Happy hereafter.

---

## II. Starve the Beast

Here's how anger works: it gets fed.

When something you want gets blocked, when something you don't want happens—that frustration is fuel. And anger drinks it up, gets drunk on it, puffs itself up, and then kills *you*.

So starve the beast. Cut off its food.

Because anger has one job and one job only: destroying me.

---

## III. The Logic of Letting Go

Now here's some practical wisdom:⁴

**If there's something you can do about it—why be upset?**

**If there's nothing you can do about it—why be upset?**

Read it again. Let it sink in.

We don't want suffering, contempt, harsh words, disgrace. We want those for our enemies, not ourselves. That's just how we're built.

But here's the truth: happiness is hard to come by. Suffering comes easy, without any effort at all.

And—here's the thing—*liberation only comes through suffering*.

So, mind: be strong. Get tough.

The devotees of Durgā⁵ and the Karṇāṭa people endure burning and cutting for the sake of liberation. And it's pointless suffering. Why am I such a coward when mine has a purpose?

There's nothing that practice can't make natural. Start with small discomforts. Practice bearing them. And soon, even the big pain becomes bearable.

Biting gnats, flies, hunger, thirst, itching—you see these as meaningless suffering? Cold, heat, rain, wind, sickness, getting hit—don't be delicate about them. Otherwise the suffering just grows.

Some folks see their own blood and get *more* courageous. Others see somebody else's blood and faint. It's all in the mind. So become unconquerable by pain. Overcome the discomfort.

Even in suffering, the wise one doesn't disturb the mind's serenity. There's a war going on with the afflictions. In war, you're gonna get hurt.

The heroes are the ones who take the enemy's blows on their chests and still win. The rest are just killing corpses.

And here's another benefit of suffering: through disenchantment, pride falls away. Compassion arises for those trapped in saṃsāra. Fear of evil. Longing for the Victor.

---

## IV. Nobody's Really in Charge

Why am I not angry at bile, at phlegm, at fever—even though they cause me a lot of pain?⁶

Because they're just conditions. They don't *choose* to hurt me. They just do what conditions do.

Same with people. They're provoked by conditions too.

Just as this pain arises without being wished for, anger also arises forcefully, though nobody wishes for it. A person doesn't get angry by thinking "I'm gonna get angry now." Anger doesn't arise by planning to arise.

Whatever offenses there are, whatever evils—all arise through the force of conditions. There's nothing independent. Nobody's truly in charge.

The collection of conditions doesn't think "I shall produce." What gets produced doesn't think "I was produced." Even that so-called primal self—it doesn't think "I shall come into being."

Everything—*everything*—depends on something else. And that something else? It depends on something *else*. All the way down. Nobody's independent. Nobody's really in control.

Beings are like magical creations, going through motions without true volition.⁷

So who should I be angry at?

If somebody says "Then warding off anger is pointless—who wards off what?"—no. It's appropriate, because there *is* dependent origination, and cessation of suffering *is* accepted.

Next time you see somebody—enemy or friend—doing wrong, think: "Such are his conditions."⁸ Understand that, and you'll be at peace.

---

## V. They Can't Help Themselves

If everybody achieved their goals just by wishing, nobody would suffer. Nobody *wants* to suffer.

But look: through carelessness, people hurt *themselves* with thorns. Through anger, with fasting. Through desire for unattainable women.

Some kill themselves by hanging, by jumping off cliffs, by eating poison and unwholesome stuff, and by non-meritorious conduct.

If people kill even their own beloved selves when overcome by afflictions—how could they possibly restrain themselves toward others?

When people are maddened by afflictions, engaged in self-destruction—shouldn't there be compassion? How is anger even arising?

If it's the nature of fools to cause harm, anger toward them isn't appropriate—just as anger toward fire for burning.

And if this fault is just passing through, and beings are naturally gentle—anger is *still* inappropriate. Like being angry at the sky for acrid smoke.

---

## VI. I Brought This On Myself

If you're ignoring the main cause—the stick—and getting angry at the one who pushed you, well, that one too was pushed by hatred. Better to be angry at hatred itself.

Let me be honest:⁹

In the past, I did this same thing to others. I caused harm. I inflicted pain.

So this harm that's coming to me now? It's just what I deserve. I'm a harm-causer, and harm-causers get harmed.

Both his weapon and my body are causes of suffering. He picked up the weapon; I picked up the body. Which one should I be angry at?

This body-boil I took up, shaped like a person, can't bear to be touched. Blinded by craving, I picked it up. Now when it hurts—who should I be angry at?

I don't want suffering, but foolishly I want its cause. When suffering comes from my own fault, why be angry at someone else?

The sword-leaf forests of hell, the hell-birds—all produced by my own karma. At what should I be angry?

The people who harm me arose, impelled by my karma. By harming me, they'll go to hells. Haven't I killed them?

But here's where it gets turned upside down:¹⁰

By relying on these enemies, my sin is destroyed through patience. But by relying on me, they go to hells of long suffering.

I've been hurting these beings. But they're the ones helping *me*—by giving me the chance to practice patience.

So why, wicked mind, are you getting angry at your benefactors?

---

## VII. What Can Words Really Do?

The mind is formless. It can't be harmed by anyone anywhere. But through attachment to the body, you're afflicted by bodily suffering.

Contempt, harsh speech, disgrace—this group doesn't harm the body. So why, mind, are you getting angry?

Will others' displeasure devour me? Either in this life or another? Why is it unwanted?

If it's unwanted because it blocks my gain—well, gain perishes here; sin remains forever.

Better death today than a long life through wrong livelihood. Even after living long, there's still the suffering of death.

One person enjoys happiness for a hundred years in a dream, then wakes up. Another is happy for a moment, then wakes up. When they wake, happiness ends for both. Same at death—for those who lived long and those who lived briefly.

Even after obtaining huge gains and enjoying pleasures a long time, I'll go empty-handed and naked, like someone who was robbed.

If through gain I live and do good—isn't it true that one who's angry for gain's sake destroys good and does evil?

If the very purpose for which I live perishes—what's the use of a life that only does evil?

---

## VIII. Rejoice in Others' Good Fortune

If others have gotten happiness by praising someone rich in virtues, mind, you too—praise him! Why don't you rejoice?

This joy in others' virtue is blameless, a source of happiness, not forbidden by the virtuous—the best way to win people over.

If it's "just his happiness"—then if you don't like that, you destroy both visible and invisible results.

When your virtue is praised, you want others' happiness too. When another's virtue is praised, you don't even want your own happiness.

You generated bodhicitta out of desire for all beings' happiness. Why are you now angry at beings who got happiness by themselves?

You say you want buddhahood for beings—it's worshipped by the three worlds. Then why are you burned seeing their transitory honor?

One who nourishes the one you should nourish—he gives to *you*. Finding someone who supports his family, you don't rejoice but get angry?

Someone who wishes awakening for beings—does he not wish this? Where's the bodhicitta of one who's angry at another's prosperity?

If something wasn't received by your enemy, it stayed in the donor's house. Either way, it's not yours. What does it matter?

Should he block his merit? His admirers? His virtues? When receiving, should he not accept? Tell me—at whom are you *not* angry?

You don't even grieve for your own evil but want to compete with those who did good?

If something unpleasant happened to your enemy, what good does your satisfaction do? Your wish alone won't cause anything.

Even if it were accomplished by your wish—what happiness is there in his suffering for you? And if there were purpose, what misfortune could be greater?

This is the terrible fishhook cast by the affliction-fishermen. They'll purchase you and cook you in the hell-pots.

---

## IX. Fame Isn't Worth Anything

Praise, fame, honor—these aren't for merit, not for longevity, not for strength, not for health, not for bodily comfort.

For a wise person who knows his own purpose—should he chase gambling and drinking if he wants mental happiness?

For fame, some give away wealth and even kill themselves. What, are syllables edible? And when you're dead, whose is that happiness?

Just as a child cries when his sand castle is broken, my mind looks just like that when praise and fame are lost.

A word, lacking consciousness—it's impossible that it praises me. "Someone else is pleased with me"—if that's the joy-cause—

—what's the use of another's joy to me, whether in me or another? That pleasure-happiness is *his*. Not even a small part is mine.

If my happiness is through his happiness, that should be true everywhere. Why isn't there happiness for me when others are happy through another's favor?

The joy that arises thinking "I am praised"—even that is merely childish behavior, unconnected to reality.

Praise and the rest disturb my equanimity, destroy my disenchantment, create jealousy toward the virtuous, and anger at success.

So those present for destroying my praise—aren't they engaged in protecting me from falling to lower realms?

It's inappropriate for me, seeking liberation, to be bound by gain and honor. Those who free me from bondage—how can I be angry at them?

For one who wishes to enter suffering, those who've become like a closed door—as if by the Buddha's blessing—how can I be angry?

---

## X. The Treasure of an Enemy

If somebody says "He created an obstacle to merit"—anger isn't appropriate. There's no austerity like patience—surely this is it, arrived at last.

If through my own fault I don't practice patience here, then *I* created the obstacle, when the cause was present.

Whatever something cannot exist without, and on whose existence it does exist—that's its *cause*. How is it called an obstacle?

An obstacle to generosity isn't made by a beggar who comes at the right time. Arriving for ordination isn't called an obstacle to ordination.

People who beg are everywhere.¹¹ Easy to find.

But people who harm you? *Rare.*

If I haven't offended anybody, nobody's going to offend me. So when someone does harm me, it's special. It's unusual.

The enemy is like a treasure that showed up in my house without any effort on my part.¹² A helper in the bodhisattva work. If I'm smart, I'll cherish that enemy.

The fruit of patience is obtained by me and by him. So to him first should it be given—patience came first from him.

If somebody says "He has no intention of accomplishing patience, so the enemy shouldn't be honored"—then why is the true Dharma honored, even though it's just a suitable cause?

If the enemy shouldn't be honored because his intention is to harm—how else would I have patience, as toward a physician intent on benefit?

It's precisely in dependence on his hostile intention that patience arises. He *is* the cause of patience. He should be honored by me like the true Dharma.

---

## XI. Beings Are Equal to Buddhas

The Sage said it straight:¹³ the field of beings and the field of Buddhas are equal. Plenty of folks have made it all the way to the other shore just by pleasing beings.

When the acquisition of Buddha-qualities from beings and from Victors is equal, what logic is there in not treating beings with the same respect as Victors?

The greatness of intention isn't from itself but from its effect. Therefore beings are equal—they're the same.

Friendliness of intention is what's worthy of honor—that's the greatness of beings. Merit from pleasing the Buddha—that's the greatness of the Buddha.

Beings are equal to Victors in contributing to Buddha-qualities. But none are equal to Buddhas—oceans of virtue with infinite portions.

If even a particle of virtue were seen in those unique concentrations of virtue-essence, even the three worlds wouldn't be enough for worship.

But in beings there exists the best portion of giving rise to Buddha-qualities. In proportion to that, worship of beings should be made.

What other repayment for genuine family of immeasurable benefit could there be than pleasing beings?

For their sake bodies are torn apart and one enters Avīci. When that's done for them, that's done. Therefore one should do only good toward these, even though they're great offenders.

My lords themselves are unconcerned even for their own selves, for their own sake. How can I act with pride toward these lords and not with servitude?

From beings' happiness comes the joy of the Lords of Sages. At their suffering, the Lords enter anger. From pleasing them comes all the Lords' delight. Harm to them is harm to the Sages.

Just as there's no mental happiness for someone whose body is on fire everywhere, even with all pleasures—for those made of compassion, there's no means of joy when beings suffer.

---

## XII. My Vow

Whatever suffering I've caused to all the greatly compassionate ones by harming beings—today I confess that sin. May the Sages forgive what distressed them.

To please the Tathāgatas, today I enter servitude to the world with my whole self. Let the multitudes of beings place their feet on my head or strike me. May the Lord of the World be pleased.

The compassionate ones have made this entire world their own—no doubt. Those seen in the form of beings—they themselves are the Protectors. Why disrespect here?

**This—*this*—is how you please the Tathāgatas.¹⁴ This is how you accomplish your own welfare. This is how you take the suffering off the world's back.**

**Let this be my vow.**

Just as a single king's officer overpowers a great people—the people can't resist, because they're far-seeing. He's not alone; the king's power is his.

Don't despise any weak offender. The hell-guardians and the compassionate ones are his power. So please beings as a servant pleases a fierce king.

What could an angered king do that would equal the hell-suffering from making beings unhappy?

What could a pleased king give that would equal buddhahood from making beings happy?

Setting aside the future buddhahood that comes from pleasing beings—don't you see even here the good fortune, fame, and well-being?

**And what does the patient one get, walking through this round of existence?**¹⁵

Good looks.
Good health.
Joy.
Long life.
The vast happiness of a world-ruling king.

All that comes to the one who practices patience.

## Theological Notes

- **Anger as Self-Destruction**: The Blues knows this—when you hold onto bitterness, you're the one who burns.
- **Understanding Causation**: "Such are his conditions" is the compassionate response.
- **Enemies as Benefactors**: Hard teaching. The one who wrongs you gives you the chance to practice patience.
- **Beings = Buddhas**: Pleasing beings is pleasing the Buddhas. This is the foundation of bodhisattva ethics.
