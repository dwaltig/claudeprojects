# Chapter 6: When the World Treats You Wrong

## Kṣāntipāramitā — The Perfection of Patience

*A Blues Interpretation by William Altig*

## Anger Burns It All Down

Listen to me now. This is serious.¹

All that good you've done—the giving, the worship, the practice—everything built up over thousands of lifetimes? One flash of anger burns it to ash.

There's no evil like hatred. And there's no austerity like patience.² So learn patience. Work at it. Find every way you can.

When that thorn of hatred is stuck in your heart,³ the mind can't rest. Can't find peace. Can't feel pleasure. Can't sleep. Can't hold steady.

Even the people you've helped—the ones who depend on you, the ones you've treated right—even *they* want to see you dead when you're eaten up with anger. Your friends pull away. You give, but nobody serves you.

Bottom line: there's nothing—*nothing*—that goes right for the angry man.

So the one who destroys anger, who keeps at it without giving up? That one is happy here. Happy hereafter.

## Starve the Beast

Here's how anger works: it gets fed.

When something you want gets blocked, when something you don't want happens—that frustration is fuel. And anger drinks it up, gets drunk on it, puffs itself up, and then kills *you*.

So starve the beast. Cut off its food.

Because anger has one job and one job only: destroying me.

## The Logic of Letting Go

Now here's some practical wisdom:⁴

**If there's something you can do about it—why be upset?**

**If there's nothing you can do about it—why be upset?**

Read it again. Let it sink in.

We don't want suffering, contempt, harsh words, disgrace. We want those for our enemies, not ourselves. That's just how we're built.

But here's the truth: happiness is hard to come by. Suffering comes easy, without any effort at all.

And—here's the thing—*liberation only comes through suffering*.

So, mind: be strong. Get tough.

The devotees of Durgā⁵ and the Karṇāṭa people endure burning and cutting for the sake of liberation. And it's pointless suffering. Why am I such a coward when mine has a purpose?

There's nothing that practice can't make natural. Start with small discomforts. Practice bearing them. And soon, even the big pain becomes bearable.

Biting gnats, flies, hunger, thirst, itching—you see these as meaningless suffering? Cold, heat, rain, wind, sickness, getting hit—don't be delicate about them. Otherwise the suffering just grows.

Some folks see their own blood and get *more* courageous. Others see somebody else's blood and faint. It's all in the mind. So become unconquerable by pain. Overcome the discomfort.

Even in suffering, the wise one doesn't disturb the mind's serenity. There's a war going on with the afflictions. In war, you're gonna get hurt.

The heroes are the ones who take the enemy's blows on their chests and still win. The rest are just killing corpses.

And here's another benefit of suffering: through disenchantment, pride falls away. Compassion arises for those trapped in saṃsāra. Fear of evil. Longing for the Victor.

## Nobody's Really in Charge

Why am I not angry at bile, at phlegm, at fever—even though they cause me a lot of pain?⁶

Because they're just conditions. They don't *choose* to hurt me. They just do what conditions do.

Same with people. They're provoked by conditions too.

Just as this pain arises without being wished for, anger also arises forcefully, though nobody wishes for it. A person doesn't get angry by thinking "I'm gonna get angry now." Anger doesn't arise by planning to arise.

Whatever offenses there are, whatever evils—all arise through the force of conditions. There's nothing independent. Nobody's truly in charge.

The collection of conditions doesn't think "I shall produce." What gets produced doesn't think "I was produced." Even that so-called primal self—it doesn't think "I shall come into being."

Everything—*everything*—depends on something else. And that something else? It depends on something *else*. All the way down. Nobody's independent. Nobody's really in control.

Beings are like magical creations, going through motions without true volition.⁷

So who should I be angry at?

If somebody says "Then warding off anger is pointless—who wards off what?"—no. It's appropriate, because there *is* dependent origination, and cessation of suffering *is* accepted.

Next time you see somebody—enemy or friend—doing wrong, think: "Such are his conditions."⁸ Understand that, and you'll be at peace.

## They Can't Help Themselves

If everybody achieved their goals just by wishing, nobody would suffer. Nobody *wants* to suffer.

But look: through carelessness, people hurt *themselves* with thorns. Through anger, with fasting. Through desire for unattainable women.

Some kill themselves by hanging, by jumping off cliffs, by eating poison and unwholesome stuff, and by non-meritorious conduct.

If people kill even their own beloved selves when overcome by afflictions—how could they possibly restrain themselves toward others?

When people are maddened by afflictions, engaged in self-destruction—shouldn't there be compassion? How is anger even arising?

If it's the nature of fools to cause harm, anger toward them isn't appropriate—just as anger toward fire for burning.

And if this fault is just passing through, and beings are naturally gentle—anger is *still* inappropriate. Like being angry at the sky for acrid smoke.

## I Brought This On Myself

If you're ignoring the main cause—the stick—and getting angry at the one who pushed you, well, that one too was pushed by hatred. Better to be angry at hatred itself.

Let me be honest:⁹

In the past, I did this same thing to others. I caused harm. I inflicted pain.

So this harm that's coming to me now? It's just what I deserve. I'm a harm-causer, and harm-causers get harmed.

Both his weapon and my body are causes of suffering. He picked up the weapon; I picked up the body. Which one should I be angry at?

This body-boil I took up, shaped like a person, can't bear to be touched. Blinded by craving, I picked it up. Now when it hurts—who should I be angry at?

I don't want suffering, but foolishly I want its cause. When suffering comes from my own fault, why be angry at someone else?

The sword-leaf forests of hell, the hell-birds—all produced by my own karma. At what should I be angry?

The people who harm me arose, impelled by my karma. By harming me, they'll go to hells. Haven't I killed them?

But here's where it gets turned upside down:¹⁰

By relying on these enemies, my sin is destroyed through patience. But by relying on me, they go to hells of long suffering.

I've been hurting these beings. But they're the ones helping *me*—by giving me the chance to practice patience.

So why, wicked mind, are you getting angry at your benefactors?

---

## What Can Words Really Do?

The mind is formless. It can't be harmed by anyone anywhere. But through attachment to the body, you're afflicted by bodily suffering.

Contempt, harsh speech, disgrace—this group doesn't harm the body. So why, mind, are you getting angry?

Will others' displeasure devour me? Either in this life or another? Why is it unwanted?

If it's unwanted because it blocks my gain—well, gain perishes here; sin remains forever.

Better death today than a long life through wrong livelihood. Even after living long, there's still the suffering of death.

One person enjoys happiness for a hundred years in a dream, then wakes up. Another is happy for a moment, then wakes up. When they wake, happiness ends for both. Same at death—for those who lived long and those who lived briefly.

Even after obtaining huge gains and enjoying pleasures a long time, I'll go empty-handed and naked, like someone who was robbed.

If through gain I live and do good—isn't it true that one who's angry for gain's sake destroys good and does evil?

If the very purpose for which I live perishes—what's the use of a life that only does evil?

---

## Rejoice in Others' Good Fortune

If others have gotten happiness by praising someone rich in virtues, mind, you too—praise him! Why don't you rejoice?

This joy in others' virtue is blameless, a source of happiness, not forbidden by the virtuous—the best way to win people over.

If it's "just his happiness"—then if you don't like that, you destroy both visible and invisible results.

When your virtue is praised, you want others' happiness too. When another's virtue is praised, you don't even want your own happiness.

You generated bodhicitta out of desire for all beings' happiness. Why are you now angry at beings who got happiness by themselves?

You say you want buddhahood for beings—it's worshipped by the three worlds. Then why are you burned seeing their transitory honor?

One who nourishes the one you should nourish—he gives to *you*. Finding someone who supports his family, you don't rejoice but get angry?

Someone who wishes awakening for beings—does he not wish this? Where's the bodhicitta of one who's angry at another's prosperity?

If something wasn't received by your enemy, it stayed in the donor's house. Either way, it's not yours. What does it matter?

Should he block his merit? His admirers? His virtues? When receiving, should he not accept? Tell me—at whom are you *not* angry?

You don't even grieve for your own evil but want to compete with those who did good?

If something unpleasant happened to your enemy, what good does your satisfaction do? Your wish alone won't cause anything.

Even if it were accomplished by your wish—what happiness is there in his suffering for you? And if there were purpose, what misfortune could be greater?

This is the terrible fishhook cast by the affliction-fishermen. They'll purchase you and cook you in the hell-pots.

---

## Fame Isn't Worth Anything

Praise, fame, honor—these aren't for merit, not for longevity, not for strength, not for health, not for bodily comfort.

For a wise person who knows his own purpose—should he chase gambling and drinking if he wants mental happiness?

For fame, some give away wealth and even kill themselves. What, are syllables edible? And when you're dead, whose is that happiness?

Just as a child cries when his sand castle is broken, my mind looks just like that when praise and fame are lost.

A word, lacking consciousness—it's impossible that it praises me. "Someone else is pleased with me"—if that's the joy-cause—

—what's the use of another's joy to me, whether in me or another? That pleasure-happiness is *his*. Not even a small part is mine.

If my happiness is through his happiness, that should be true everywhere. Why isn't there happiness for me when others are happy through another's favor?

The joy that arises thinking "I am praised"—even that is merely childish behavior, unconnected to reality.

Praise and the rest disturb my equanimity, destroy my disenchantment, create jealousy toward the virtuous, and anger at success.

So those present for destroying my praise—aren't they engaged in protecting me from falling to lower realms?

It's inappropriate for me, seeking liberation, to be bound by gain and honor. Those who free me from bondage—how can I be angry at them?

For one who wishes to enter suffering, those who've become like a closed door—as if by the Buddha's blessing—how can I be angry?

---

## The Treasure of an Enemy

If somebody says "He created an obstacle to merit"—anger isn't appropriate. There's no austerity like patience—surely this is it, arrived at last.

If through my own fault I don't practice patience here, then *I* created the obstacle, when the cause was present.

Whatever something cannot exist without, and on whose existence it does exist—that's its *cause*. How is it called an obstacle?

An obstacle to generosity isn't made by a beggar who comes at the right time. Arriving for ordination isn't called an obstacle to ordination.

People who beg are everywhere.¹¹ Easy to find.

But people who harm you? *Rare.*

If I haven't offended anybody, nobody's going to offend me. So when someone does harm me, it's special. It's unusual.

The enemy is like a treasure that showed up in my house without any effort on my part.¹² A helper in the bodhisattva work. If I'm smart, I'll cherish that enemy.

The fruit of patience is obtained by me and by him. So to him first should it be given—patience came first from him.

If somebody says "He has no intention of accomplishing patience, so the enemy shouldn't be honored"—then why is the true Dharma honored, even though it's just a suitable cause?

If the enemy shouldn't be honored because his intention is to harm—how else would I have patience, as toward a physician intent on benefit?

It's precisely in dependence on his hostile intention that patience arises. He *is* the cause of patience. He should be honored by me like the true Dharma.

## Beings Are Equal to Buddhas

The Sage said it straight:¹³ the field of beings and the field of Buddhas are equal. Plenty of folks have made it all the way to the other shore just by pleasing beings.

When the acquisition of Buddha-qualities from beings and from Victors is equal, what logic is there in not treating beings with the same respect as Victors?

The greatness of intention isn't from itself but from its effect. Therefore beings are equal—they're the same.

Friendliness of intention is what's worthy of honor—that's the greatness of beings. Merit from pleasing the Buddha—that's the greatness of the Buddha.

Beings are equal to Victors in contributing to Buddha-qualities. But none are equal to Buddhas—oceans of virtue with infinite portions.

If even a particle of virtue were seen in those unique concentrations of virtue-essence, even the three worlds wouldn't be enough for worship.

But in beings there exists the best portion of giving rise to Buddha-qualities. In proportion to that, worship of beings should be made.

What other repayment for genuine family of immeasurable benefit could there be than pleasing beings?

For their sake bodies are torn apart and one enters Avīci. When that's done for them, that's done. Therefore one should do only good toward these, even though they're great offenders.

My lords themselves are unconcerned even for their own selves, for their own sake. How can I act with pride toward these lords and not with servitude?

From beings' happiness comes the joy of the Lords of Sages. At their suffering, the Lords enter anger. From pleasing them comes all the Lords' delight. Harm to them is harm to the Sages.

Just as there's no mental happiness for someone whose body is on fire everywhere, even with all pleasures—for those made of compassion, there's no means of joy when beings suffer.

---

## My Vow

Whatever suffering I've caused to all the greatly compassionate ones by harming beings—today I confess that sin. May the Sages forgive what distressed them.

To please the Tathāgatas, today I enter servitude to the world with my whole self. Let the multitudes of beings place their feet on my head or strike me. May the Lord of the World be pleased.

The compassionate ones have made this entire world their own—no doubt. Those seen in the form of beings—they themselves are the Protectors. Why disrespect here?

**This—*this*—is how you please the Tathāgatas.¹⁴ This is how you accomplish your own welfare. This is how you take the suffering off the world's back.**

**Let this be my vow.**

Just as a single king's officer overpowers a great people—the people can't resist, because they're far-seeing. He's not alone; the king's power is his.

Don't despise any weak offender. The hell-guardians and the compassionate ones are his power. So please beings as a servant pleases a fierce king.

What could an angered king do that would equal the hell-suffering from making beings unhappy?

What could a pleased king give that would equal buddhahood from making beings happy?

Setting aside the future buddhahood that comes from pleasing beings—don't you see even here the good fortune, fame, and well-being?

**And what does the patient one get, walking through this round of existence?**¹⁵

Good looks.
Good health.
Joy.
Long life.
The vast happiness of a world-ruling king.

All that comes to the one who practices patience.

## Theological Notes

- **Anger as Self-Destruction**: The Blues knows this—when you hold onto bitterness, you're the one who burns.
- **Understanding Causation**: "Such are his conditions" is the compassionate response.
- **Enemies as Benefactors**: Hard teaching. The one who wrongs you gives you the chance to practice patience.
- **Beings = Buddhas**: Pleasing beings is pleasing the Buddhas. This is the foundation of bodhisattva ethics.
