## Session 1: 2025-12-31

### Objectives

   - `01_TRANSLATIONS/` (Scholarly, Blues, Combined)
   - `03_DOCUMENTATION/`
   - `04_AGENTS/`
   - `05_QA/`

2. Created project documentation:
   - `CLAUDE.md` — Main project guide
   - `GEMINI.md` — Agent context file

3. Created adapted agent files:
   - `The_Professor.md` — Sanskrit specialist with metrical analysis

4. Created supporting docs:
