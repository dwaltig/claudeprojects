# Project Brief: The Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra
## "The Supreme Array" / "The Great Pilgrimage"

**Status**: Future Project (Sourcing Phase)
**Vibe**: The Ultimate Road Movie. *Into the Wild* meets *The Matrix*.

---

## 1. The Story
A young pilgrim named **Sudhana** sets out on a journey to find enlightenment. He visits **53 Spiritual Friends** (*Kalyāṇamitra*), including:
*   A monk who sees the universe in a cup.
*   A physician who heals with a touch.
*   A merchant who knows the math of the cosmos.
*   A prostitute (Vasumitrā) who teaches liberation through desire.
*   A boy and a girl playing in the sand.
*   The Great Bodhisattvas Maitreya and Samantabhadra.

## 2. Why It's Perfect for the Blues
*   **Structure**: It's episodic. Each teacher is a "track" on the album.
*   **Theme**: The journey *is* the destination. It's about "The Road."
*   **Scope**: It covers every aspect of human life—commerce, art, mathematics, love, royalty, asceticism—showing how *all of it* can be the Dharma.

## 3. Source Material Targets
*   **Sanskrit**: P.L. Vaidya edition (DSBC) or Suzuki/Idzumi edition.
*   **Chinese**: T.279 (Śikṣānanda) or T.278 (Buddhabhadra).
*   **English refs**: Cleary (The Flower Ornament Scripture), Gómez (The Story of Sudhana).

## 4. Proposed Title Ideas
*   *The Pilgrim's Infinite Playlist*
*   *53 Steps to Waking Up*
*   *The Supreme Logic of the Road*
