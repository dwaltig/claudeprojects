# Project Brief: The Ratnolkā Dhāraṇī
## "The Torch of Jewels"

**Status**: Future Project (Sourcing Phase)
**Vibe**: Intense Devotion. The "Revival Meeting."

---

## 1. The Core Teaching
The *Ratnolkā* is often cited by Śāntideva (in the *Śikṣāsamuccaya*) for its crushing verses on **Faith (*Śraddhā*)** and the **Merit of the Bodhisattvas**. It is a text of *revelation*—lighting a torch in the dark.

## 2. Why It's Perfect for the Blues
*   **The "Chain of Faith"**: The famous passage (quoted in Shiksha Ch 1) reads like a gospel buildup or a "ring shout." It builds momentum line by line.
*   **Imagery**: Torches, Jewels, Light, Burning Lamps. It's visually high-contrast.
*   **Length**: Short enough to be a powerful, concentrated project (an EP, not a double album).

## 3. Source Material Targets
*   **Sanskrit**: Likely found within the *Mahāsannipāta* collections or independent Dhāraṇī collections.
*   **Tibetan**: *dKon mchog ta la la*.
*   **Chinese**: *Bao deng tuo luo ni jing* (T.1340?).

## 4. Proposed Title Ideas
*   *The Torch*
*   *Fire in the Dark*
*   *The Jewel Lamp Sessions*
