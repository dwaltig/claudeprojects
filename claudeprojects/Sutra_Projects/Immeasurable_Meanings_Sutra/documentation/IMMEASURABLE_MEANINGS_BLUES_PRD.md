# Product Requirements Document: Immeasurable Meanings Sutra - Blues Edition

## 1. Vision: The "Lion's Roar" Standard
The **Blues Edition** of the *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra* is not merely a translation into African American Vernacular English (AAVE). It is a **theological transposition** of the text into the key of the Blues.

*   **The Core Metaphor:** The "One Law" (*Immeasurable Meanings*) is the **One Note** or the **Root Note** in the Blues. From this single, formless truth (the deep hum of the universe), infinite improvisations (Dharma-doors) arise to meet the specific pain of the audience.
*   **The Persona:** **Master John Kim (The Bluesman)**. He is not just a translator but a *preacher* and a *healer*. He speaks with the authority of someone who has "been to the crossroads."
*   **The Metric:** The **Broken Heart Metric**. Does this line just convey information, or does it *resonate* with the suffering of the reader? Does it make the Dharma feel like a cool drink of water on a hot day?

## 2. Scope & Deliverables
We will split the existing monolithic file into three distinct chapter files to match the Scholarly Edition's structure.

*   `blues_edition/CHAPTER_01_VIRTUOUS_CONDUCT_BLUES.md`
*   `blues_edition/CHAPTER_02_PREACHING_DHARMA_BLUES.md`
*   `blues_edition/CHAPTER_03_TEN_MERITS_BLUES.md`
*   `blues_edition/IMMEASURABLE_MEANINGS_COMPLETE_BLUES.md` (Consolidated)

## 3. Style Guidelines
*   **Vernacular:** High-dignity AAVE. Avoid caricature. Use the cadence of the pulpit and the street corner.
    *   *Examples:* "World-Honored One" -> "Lord," "World-Honored One"; "Bodhisattvas" -> "Bodhisattvas" (keep technical terms but frame them in rhythm).
    *   *Rhythm:* Use call-and-response structures ("You hear?", "Don't you know?").
*   **Integrity:** Adhere to the **Seven-Factor Integrity Protocols**.
    *   **Right Speech:** do not soften the hard truths. If the text says "hell," we say "hell."
    *   **Right View:** Ensure the AAVE does not distort the doctrinal meaning (Identity of Emptiness and Form).

## 4. Chapter-Specific Requirements

### Chapter 1: Virtuous Conduct
*   **Focus:** The "Crew." The Bodhisattvas are "spiritual warriors" and "healers."
*   **Key Verse:** The lengthy praise verse must flow like a spoken-word poem or a gospel hymn.

### Chapter 2: Preaching the Dharma
*   **Focus:** The "One Law." Use the comparison of water washing away dirt (from the Sutra) and lean into it.
*   **The Dilemma:** The "40 Years" question. The Bluesman interprets this as: "You been playing different tunes all this time, but now you hitting the real heavy chord."

### Chapter 3: Ten Merits
*   **Focus:** The "Power." How this teaching literally transforms reality.
*   **Metaphors:**
    *   *The Newborn Prince:* The "Young Lion."
    *   *The Dragon's Son:* The "Storm Bringer."
    *   *The Ferryman:* The "Old Captain" who can still steer the ship even if his body is broken.

## 5. Verification
*   **The Check:** Compare against the `SCHOLARLY` edition to ensure no meaning was lost in the transposition.
*   **The Feel:** Read aloud (mentally) to check the rhythm.
