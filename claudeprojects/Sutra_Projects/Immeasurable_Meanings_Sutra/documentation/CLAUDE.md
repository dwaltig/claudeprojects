# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains a blues/gospel translation project for the *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra*, a foundational Buddhist text that serves as the introduction to the *Lotus Sutra*. The project transforms the ancient Sanskrit teachings into African American spiritual vernacular while preserving doctrinal content and ceremonial structure.

## Repository Structure

The workspace contains multiple versions and analysis documents:

**Primary Manuscripts:**
- `The Immeasurable Meanings Sutra - Blues Edition - PUBLICATION READY.txt` — Current publication-ready version (primary working document)
- `Blues Immeasurable Meanings Sutra v3.txt` — Latest development version
- `Chinese Immeasurable Meanings Sutra.txt` — Source text in classical Chinese

**Supporting Documentation:**
- `Blues Immeasurable Meanings Sutra v3 - Introduction.md` — Editorial introduction explaining the blues translation philosophy
- `Blues Immeasurable Meanings Sutra v3 - Structural Elements.md` — Detailed chapter-by-chapter breakdown with line references
- `Immeasurable_Meanings_Sutra_Formatting_Guide.txt` — Print/digital publication specifications (6"×9" trade paperback)
- `Blues Immeasurable Meanings Sutra Glossory.txt` — Buddhist terms and character names reference
- Analysis reports (Flow & Pacing, Consistency, Revisions)

## Project Context and Vision

**Core Conceit:** The translation deliberately renders the Immeasurable Meanings Sutra in blues/gospel vernacular rather than traditional Buddhist English. This is intentional and central to the project, not an error.

**Stylistic Foundation:**
- Prose sections: Formal Buddhist scriptural language
- Verse sections: Blues/gospel vernacular with authentic African American spiritual traditions
- Both traditions share spiritual kinship: arising from suffering, transforming through wisdom, calling for liberation

**Key Features:**
- Blues vernacular features: contractions ("ain't," "gonna"), call-and-response patterns, "you hear?" interjections
- Sacred terminology preserved: Sanskrit diacriticals (Śāriputra, Mañjuśrī, anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi)
- Repetitive liturgical structure maintained from original sutra
- Three-chapter organization: Virtuous Conduct, Preaching the Dharma, Ten Powers of Merit

## Working with the Translation

### File Format and Structure

**Main Text Characteristics:**
- UTF-8 encoding (preserves Sanskrit diacriticals: ś, ṇ, ū, ā, ṃ)
- Plain text format for portability and version control
- Line numbers included in structural documents for cross-referencing
- Formatting guide specifies Georgia 11pt body / 12pt verse, justified alignment, 0.25" first-line indent

**Character Names (Always Use Diacriticals):**
Never simplify: Śāriputra (not Sariputra), Mañjuśrī (not Manjusri), Avalokiteśvara, Mahākāśyapa, Maitreya

**Standard Technical Terms:**
- Tathagata, Bodhisattva, Dharma, nirvāṇa, samādhi, śrāvaka
- Anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi (supreme enlightenment)
- Buddha, Enlightenment, Great Vehicle
- Follow established capitalization patterns

### Verse vs. Prose Conventions

**Prose Sections:** Formal Buddhist English with elevated tone, complete sentences, scholarly terminology

**Verse Sections:** Blues/gospel style with:
- Natural vernacular contractions and speech patterns
- Repetitive structures and refrains (mimicking blues/gospel tradition)
- Call-and-response elements ("you hear?", "don't you know")
- Authentic rhythm and cadence suitable for oral recitation/singing
- Preserved line breaks (do not reflow as standard prose)

### Common Editorial Tasks

**When analyzing consistency:**
- Reference the Consistency Analysis Report for identified issues (primarily prose/verse tone bifurcation in earlier Lotus translation)
- Use the Structural Elements document to locate specific passages by chapter and line number
- Check the Glossary for proper names and technical term spelling

**When editing verses:**
- Preserve line breaks—these are intentional rhythmic units
- Test rhythm aloud; blues/gospel verses should have natural singability
- Maintain vernacular voice consistency within a stanza
- Check rhyme scheme patterns (AABB common in this translation)

**When editing prose:**
- Maintain formal Buddhist scriptural tone
- Preserve Sanskrit terms with diacriticals
- Keep liturgical repetitions and formulaic language intact
- Ensure theological accuracy to source material

### Source Material Reference

The translation draws from:
- *Wuliang Yi Jing* (無量義經) — Classical Chinese source text
- Traditional Buddhist doctrine and sutra structure
- African American spiritual traditions (spirituals, gospel, blues)

## Publishing and Production

**Print Format:**
- Trim: 6" × 9" trade paperback (KDP standard)
- Font: Georgia, body 11pt / verse 12pt
- Margins: 1" top/bottom, 1.25" inside binding

**Digital Distribution:**
- Kindle Create compatible bookmarks: HalfTitle, TitlePage, Copyright, Dedication, TableOfContents, Introduction, Preface, Chapter1, Chapter2, Chapter3, Notes, Glossary, AboutAuthor
- EPUB export: preserve line breaks for verse sections
- PDF export: verify margin bleed on KDP 6×9 template

## Common Development Tasks

**Reviewing/revising manuscript sections:**
1. Reference Structural Elements to locate passage
2. Check character names and Sanskrit terms in Glossary
3. For verse: verify rhythm, rhyme scheme, vernacular consistency
4. For prose: verify tone, terminology consistency, doctrinal accuracy
5. Test line spacing and flow in formatted version

**Cross-referencing between versions:**
- Publication-ready version is primary (latest approved)
- v3 versions track development iterations
- Use line numbers from Structural Elements for precise reference

**Quality checks:**
- Verify all Sanskrit names retain proper diacriticals
- Test verse sections for natural rhythm (read aloud)
- Ensure prose maintains elevated, reverent tone
- Check that formulas (openings, transitions) are consistent

## Key Terminology and References

**The Three Chapters:**

1. **Virtuous Conduct (Lines 57-221)** — Assembly description, bodhisattva qualities, praise verses for the Buddha
2. **Preaching the Dharma (Lines 223-284)** — Core teaching on immeasurable meanings, the water parable, miraculous responses
3. **Ten Powers of Merit (Lines 287-357)** — Enumeration of benefits for practitioners who receive this sutra

**Preface (Lines 4-55):** Liu Qiu's historical introduction, debate between gradual/sudden enlightenment perspectives

**Structural Markers:** Opening formula "Thus have I heard. At one time...", verse transitions "wishing to repeat this meaning, spoke in verse:", section dividers "— • —"

## Notes on Sacred Translation Philosophy

This is a *sacred text translation*, not secular content. Editorial decisions should honor both:
1. The Buddhist tradition and doctrinal integrity
2. The African American spiritual tradition and authentic vernacular voice

The Dharma (universal Buddhist teaching) is presented through a particular cultural lens without altering its essential meaning—analogous to how the Dharma has manifested through Sanskrit, Chinese, Japanese, and other traditions throughout history.
