# CHAPTER THREE: TEN MERITS (Shi Gong De Pin)

## I. The Source and Destination of the Sutra

At that time, Great Adornment Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva again addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One! The *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra* preached by the World-Honored One is subtle, profound, and unsurpassed! It is truly profound! Profound, profound!

Why is this? In this assembly, all the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas and the four groups, as well as gods, dragons, ghosts, spirits, kings, ministers, and citizens who heard this profound, supreme Great Vehicle *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra*, without exception obtained the Dharani-doors, the Three Laws (*Trīṇi Dharmāṇi*), the Four Fruits (*Caturphala*), and the Bodhi-mind (*Bodhicitta*).

We should know that this Sutra is structurally true and correct; its worth is unsurpassed. It is protected by the Buddhas of the three times. No demons or heretics can enter into it, nor can it be destroyed by any wrong views of birth and death. Why? Because hearing it once encompasses all dharmas!

If sentient beings can hear this Sutra, it is a great benefit. Why? If they can cultivate it, they will certainly quickly attain Supreme Perfect Enlightenment. Those living beings who cannot hear it should be known as losing a great benefit. Even after passing through immeasurable, boundless, inconceivable *asaṃkhyeya* eons, they will ultimately not attain Supreme Perfect Enlightenment. Why? Not knowing the Great Path to Bodhi is direct, they walk on dangerous paths and encounter many obstructions.

World-Honored One! This classic is inconceivable. We only wish the World-Honored One would, out of compassion for the great assembly, widely proclaim the profound inconceivable matters of this Sutra. World-Honored One! Regarding this classic:
**From where does it come?**
**To where does it go?**
**Where does it abide?**
That it possesses such immeasurable merit and inconceivable power, causing the assembly to quickly attain Supreme Perfect Enlightenment?"

Then the World-Honored One addressed Great Adornment Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva: "Excellent, excellent! Good man! It is as you say, as you say. Good man! I say this Sutra is profound, profound! Truly profound! Why? Because it causes the assembly to quickly attain Supreme Perfect Enlightenment; because hearing it once encompasses all dharmas; because it greatly benefits all living beings; because it walks the Great Direct Path (*Maha-ṛju-mārga*) without obstruction.

Good man! You asked: 'From where does this Sutra come? To where does it go? Where does it abide?' Listen closely with goodness.

Good man!
*   **Source:** This Sutra originally comes from the palace of the Buddhas (*Buddha-gṛha*).
*   **Destination:** It goes to the impulse to generate the Bodhi-mind in all living beings.
*   **Abode:** It abides in the practice place of all Bodhisattvas.

Good man! This Sutra comes intimately like this, goes like this, and abides like this. Therefore, this Sutra possesses such immeasurable merit and inconceivable power, causing the assembly to quickly attain Supreme Perfect Enlightenment.

Good man! Would you like to hear the **Ten Inconceivable Merit Powers** of this Sutra?"

Great Adornment said: "We eagerly wish to hear."

## II. The Ten Inconceivable Merit Powers

### The First Merit: Transforming the Mind

The Buddha said: "Good man!
**First:** This Sutra can cause Bodhisattvas who have not generated the mind to generate the Bodhi-mind.
*   Those without kindness generate a kind mind.
*   Those who love slaughter generate a mind of great compassion.
*   Those who generate jealousy generate a mind of joyful correspondence (*muditā*).
*   Those with attachment generate a mind of renunciation (*upekṣā*).
*   Those who are miserly generate a mind of giving (*dāna*).
*   Those who are arrogant generate a mind of morality (*śīla*).
*   Those full of anger generate a mind of patience (*kṣānti*).
*   Those who are lazy generate a mind of vigor (*vīrya*).
*   Those who are scattered generate a mind of meditation (*dhyāna*).
*   Those who are foolish generate a mind of wisdom (*prajñā*).
*   Those who have not saved others generate the mind to save others.
*   Those who perform the ten evils generate the ten virtues.
*   Those who delight in the conditioned (*saṃskṛta*) aspire to the unconditioned (*asaṃskṛta*).
*   Those with retreating minds create non-retreating minds.
*   Those with leaking (*āsrava*) minds generate leakless (*anāsrava*) minds.
*   Those with many afflictions generate the mind of extinction.

Good man! This is called the First Merit and Inconceivable Power of this Sutra."

### The Second Merit: One Law Encompasses All

"Good man!
**Second:** As for the inconceivable merit power of this Sutra: If a living being obtains this Sutra—whether one revolution, one verse, or even one phrase—they will penetrate a hundred thousand million meanings. Even in immeasurable eons, they could not fully explain the Dharma they have received and held. Why? Because the meaning of this Dharma is immeasurable.

Good man! This Sutra is like a **single seed** that produces a hundred thousand. Each of those hundred thousand produces another hundred thousand. Spinning forth like this, it reaches immeasurable numbers. This classic is also like this: from **One Law** it produces a hundred thousand meanings. From each of those hundred thousand meanings, another hundred thousand are produced. Spinning forth like this, it reaches immeasurable, boundless meanings. Therefore, this Sutra is called **Immeasurable Meanings**.

Good man! This is called the Second Merit and Inconceivable Power of this Sutra."

### The Third Merit: Power Despite Affliction

"Good man!
**Third:** If a living being hears this Sutra—whether one revolution, one verse, or even one phrase—and penetrates a hundred thousand million meanings... **Although they still have afflictions, it is as if they have no afflictions.** Moving through birth and death, they have no thought of fear. Towards all living beings, they generate a mind of pity. Regarding all dharmas, they obtain the thought of bravery.

Like a strong wrestler who can shoulder heavy loads, this Sutra-holder can shoulder the heavy treasure of Supreme Bodhi and carry living beings out of the path of birth and death. **Although they have not yet saved themselves, they are already able to save others.**

*   *Simile of the Ferryman:* Just as a ferryman who is sick and disabled, resting on this shore, possesses a sturdy boat and the tools of crossing, enabling others to cross.
*   *Application:* The Sutra-holder is also like this. Although their body suffers the five destinies (*gati*) and is constantly bound by 108 heavy illnesses, resting on the shore of ignorance, old age, and death—because they possess this sturdy Great Vehicle Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings, they can save living beings. Those who practice as they say attain liberation from birth and death.

Good man! This is called the Third Merit and Inconceivable Power of this Sutra."

### The Fourth Merit: The Newborn Prince

"Good man!
**Fourth:** If a living being... obtains the thought of bravery... and speaks widely for others: Good man! This person is like a newborn prince of the King and Queen. Whether one day, two days... or seven years old—although he cannot yet manage the affairs of state, strictly speaking he is already respected by the ministers and people... Why? Because he is young [and of the royal line].

Good man! The Sutra-holder is also like this. The King is the Buddhas; the Queen is this Sutra. Coming together, they give birth to this Bodhisattva-son. If this Bodhisattva hears this Sutra... **although he cannot yet embody the ultimate truth** (*tǐ zhēn lǐ jí*), nor shake the billion worlds... **Strictly speaking he is already respected by all the four groups and eight classes of beings.** He penetrates deeply into the secret Dharma of the Buddhas... always protected and mindful of the Buddhas, covered by their kindness because he is a new student.

Good man! This is called the Fourth Merit and Inconceivable Power of this Sutra."

### The Fifth Merit: Transformation of Time

"Good man!
**Fifth:** If good men or good women, during the Buddha's lifetime or after his extinction... uphold this Sutra... although they are fettered by afflictions and cannot distance themselves from the affairs of ordinary people, they can demonstrate the Great Bodhi Way. They extend one day into a hundred eons; they compress a hundred eons into one day...

Like the dragon's child: born only seven days, yet appearing like a cloud and capable of bringing rain.

Good man! This is called the Fifth Merit and Inconceivable Power of this Sutra."

### The Sixth Merit: Reducing Affliction

"Good man!
**Sixth:** If good men or good women... although possessing afflictions, preach the Dharma for living beings... causing them to sever all suffering...

Like the Prince: although young, if the King travels or is ill, he entrusts the Prince to manage state affairs... The people are at peace, just as if the Great King were ruling.

The Sutra-holder is also like this. Although they have not yet attained the **First Stage of Immobility** (*Avinivartanīya* / *Fūdòngdì*), relying on the Buddha's teaching... living beings hearing it sever afflictions... as if being taught by the Buddha Tathāgata without difference.

Good man! This is called the Sixth Merit and Inconceivable Power of this Sutra."

### The Seventh Merit: The Six Perfections Spontaneous

"Good man!
**Seventh:** If good men or good women... hearing this Sutra... conceive a rare thought (*adbhuta-citta*)... Although they have not cultivated the Six Perfections (*Pāramitās*), the Six Perfections spontaneously appear before them. In this very body they obtain the patience of non-arising (*anutpattika-dharma-kṣānti*). The afflictions of birth and death are severed in a moment. They ascend to the Seventh Ground.

Like a fierce warrior eradicating the King's enemies... the King joyfully grants him half the kingdom...

The Sutra-holder... the enemies of birth and death naturally scatter... attaining the outcome of half the Buddha-land's treasure.

Good man! This is called the Seventh Merit and Inconceivable Power of this Sutra."

### The Eighth Merit: Reversing the Skeptics

"Good man!
**Eighth:** ...If someone does not believe there is sin or blessing... [the Sutra-holder] shows them this Sutra... forcefully causing them to believe. By the power of the Sutra, their hearts open and turn back (*huí*). Once faith arises... they can attain the Way and the Fruit.

Therefore, good men and good women, in this very body, can attain the patience of non-arising, attain the Upper Grounds (*Upper Bhūmis*), and become retinues of the Bodhisattvas...

Good man! This is called the Eighth Merit and Inconceivable Power of this Sutra."

### The Ninth Merit: Cleansing Karma

"Good man!
**Ninth:** ...Heavy hindrances and residue of past karma are destroyed in a moment (*yīshí mièjìn*)... They become pure... attain great eloquence... enter the Great Dhāraṇī-door... quickly transcending to the Upper Grounds. They are able to divide their bodies (*kāya-vibhāga*) to pervade the lands of the ten directions... saving all beings suffering in the twenty-five forms of existence.

Good man! This is called the Ninth Merit and Inconceivable Power of this Sutra."

### The Tenth Merit: The Great Reservoir

"Good man!
**Tenth:** ...If they obtain this Sutra... and vastly exhort lay and monastic people to uphold it... these good men and good women, in this very body, attain immeasurable Dhāraṇī-doors. In the stage of ordinary beings (*pṛthagjana*), naturally at the initial time, they generate numberless *asaṃkhyeya* great vows... deeply saving all... thickly accumulating good roots...

They act as a great reservoir of Dharma provided to all... soothing and comforting all... gradually causing them to ascend to abide in the **Dharma Cloud Ground** (*Dharmameghā-bhūmi*, the 10th Ground). Their grace and moisture pervade everywhere... causing suffering beings to enter the path-traces.

Therefore, this person will before long attain Supreme Perfect Enlightenment. Good man! This is called the Tenth Merit and Inconceivable Power of this Sutra."

## III. Conclusion and Entrustment

"Good man! This supreme Great Vehicle *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra* possesses extreme awe-inspiring spiritual power (*mahā-ṛddhi-bala*). Its worth is unsurpassed. It can cause all ordinary beings to become Sages (*ārya*), forever leaving birth and death to obtain sovereignty (*aishvarya*). Therefore, this Sutra is called **Immeasurable Meanings**. It can cause the buds of the Way (*bodhi-aṅkura*) of all Bodhisattvas to sprout in the ground of ordinary beings, making the tree of merit lush, widespread, and growing."

Thereupon, Great Adornment Bodhisattva... said: "World-Honored One! This Sutra is wonderful... The World-Honored One's compassion is indeed hard to repay."

At that time, the three-thousand great-thousand world system shook in six ways... [Further description of heavenly flowers and offerings]...

The Buddha told Great Adornment Bodhisattva: "You should generate a deep mind of respect for this Sutra... widely circulate it... do not let it stagnate. In the future age, you must cause it to be practiced widely in Jambudvīpa... causing all to see, hear, read, recite, write, and offer to it. By this cause, you will also quickly attain Supreme Perfect Enlightenment."

Great Adornment Bodhisattva... vowed: "World-Honored One! Do not worry... We will use our vow-power to widely cause all living beings to see, hear, read, recite, write, and offer to this Sutra..."

The Buddha praised them: "Excellent! You are truly sons of the Buddha... the great field of blessings for all living beings..."

At that time, the great assembly rejoiced greatly, paid reverence to the Buddha, accepted and upheld the teaching, and departed.

## IV. Philosophical Commentary & Scholarly Apparatus

### Technical Terms & Philological Notes

1.  **Dharani-doors (*dhāraṇī-mukha*)**: "Whatever one hears, one holds and does not lose." The ability to retain and integrate infinite teachings.
2.  **Immeasurable Meanings Samādhi (*anantanirdeśa-pratiṣṭhāna-samādhi*)**: The specific meditative absorption attained by the assembly. It is the state where the "One Law" acts as the source for infinite applications.
3.  **Ordinary Being (*pṛthagjana*)**: The sutra repeatedly emphasizes that one can attain these merits *while still being an ordinary being with afflictions*. This anticipates the "Identity in Practice" (*guānxhíng jí*) stage of Tiantai's **Six Identities**, where the realization is profound but the habits of defilement remain.

### The Ten Merits (Summary Analysis)

The "Ten Merits" chapter is structurally critical as it bridges the "Theory" of Chapter 2 (Emptiness/One Law) with the "Practice" of the Lotus Sutra.

*   **Merits 1-3 (Internal):** Transformation of the practitioner's own mind (*Bodhicitta*, Faith).
*   **Merits 4-6 (Relational):** The power of the practitioner to influence others despite their own immaturity (The Newborn Prince, The Sick Ferryman).
*   **Merits 7-10 (Transcendental):** The rapid ascent through the Bhūmis (Stages) and the attainment of supernatural powers (*ṛddhi*) and sovereignty (*aishvarya*).

**Note on the "Sick Ferryman" (Merit 3):** This is one of the most famous metaphors in East Asian Buddhism. It validates the bodhisattva practice of teaching and saving others *even before* one is fully enlightened oneself. It is a direct rebuttal to the Arhat ideal of "saving oneself first."

**Note on the "Newborn Prince" (Merit 4):** Represents the "Buddha-nature" or "Tathāgatagarbha" doctrine. The prince (Bodhisattva) has the royal lineage (Buddha-nature) and is thus worthy of respect even as an infant (beginner), unlike the ministers (Arhats) who are aged/experienced but not of the royal line.
