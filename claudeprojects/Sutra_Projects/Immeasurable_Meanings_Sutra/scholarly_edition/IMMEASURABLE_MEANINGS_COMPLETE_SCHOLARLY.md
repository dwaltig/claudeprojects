# CHAPTER ONE: VIRTUOUS CONDUCT

## I. The Assembly at Vulture Peak

Thus have I heard:

At one time, the Buddha was staying at Vulture Peak Mountain near the city of Rājagṛha, accompanied by a great assembly of twelve thousand monks. There were also eighty thousand bodhisattva-mahāsattvas, as well as gods (*devas*), dragons (*nāgas*), *yakṣas*, *gandharvas*, *asuras*, *garuḍas*, *kinnaras*, and *mahoragas*. Also in attendance were monks (*bhikṣus*), nuns (*bhikṣuṇīs*), laymen (*upāsakas*), and laywomen (*upāsikās*).

The assembly included great wheel-turning kings (*cakravartin*), minor wheel-turning kings, and kings of the gold, silver, and other realms. Princes, ministers, citizens, gentlemen, ladies, and great elders were each surrounded by hundreds of thousands of followers. They all approached the Buddha, bowed their heads at His feet, circled Him a hundred thousand times, and made various offerings of incense and flowers. After paying their respects, they withdrew and sat to one side.

### The Named Bodhisattvas

Among the bodhisattvas were the Dharma Princes Mañjuśrī, Great Majestic Virtue Treasury, Sorrowless Treasury, and Great Eloquence Treasury. There were also Maitreya Bodhisattva, Chief Guide Bodhisattva, Medicine King Bodhisattva, and Medicine Superior Bodhisattva.

Other prominent bodhisattvas included Flower Banner, Flower Light Banner, Dhāraṇī Self-Mastery King, Avalokiteśvara, Mahāsthāmaprāpta, Constant Vigor, Jewel Seal Hand, Jewel Accumulation, Jewel Staff, Transcending the Three Realms, Vimālavara, Fragrant Elephant, Great Fragrant Elephant, Lion’s Roar King, Lion Sport in the World, Lion’s Swift Advance, Lion’s Vigor, Brave and Sharp Power, Lion’s Majestic Subduing, Adornment, and Great Adornment Bodhisattva. In all, there were eighty thousand such bodhisattva-mahāsattvas gathered together.

## II. The Qualities of the Bodhisattvas

These bodhisattvas were all great beings (*mahāsattvas*) of the Dharma-body (*dharmakāya*), accomplished in morality (*śīla*), meditation (*samādhi*), wisdom (*prajñā*), liberation (*vimukti*), and the knowledge and vision of liberation (*vimukti-jñāna-darśana*). Their minds were tranquil and constantly dwelled in samādhi. They were calm, clear, and free from desire or artifice. Delusion and confused thoughts could no longer penetrate their minds.

They were still and clear (*jìngjì qingchéng*), their aspirations profound and vast (*zhì xuán xū mò*). They upheld this state unmoving (*shǒu zhī bùdòng*) for billions of eons. In this state, immeasurable Dharma-doors appeared before them. They attained great wisdom, penetrated all teachings, and clearly understood the true nature and characteristics of all things (*shì-xiàng zhēnshí*)—existence and non-existence, long and short—manifesting them with perfect clarity.

They understood the various capacities and desires of all beings. With the power of *dhāraṇī* and unobstructed eloquence, they requested the Buddha to turn the Wheel of Dharma, and they themselves could turn it in accordance with his teaching. Like the first drops of rain that moisten the dust of desire, they opened the gates of nirvana, fanned the winds of liberation, extinguished the world’s burning afflictions, and brought the cooling refreshment of the Dharma.

## III. The Assembled Arhats

Among the monks were: Great Wisdom Śāriputra, the miracle-worker Maudgalyāyana, the venerable Subhūti, Mahākātyāyana, Pūrṇa son of Maitrāyaṇī, and Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya. Also present were the celestial-eyed Aniruddha, the discipline-keeper Upāli, the attendant Ānanda, the Buddha’s son Rāhula, Upananda, Revata, Gavāṃpati, Bakkula, Acyuta, Svāgata, and the great ascetic Mahākāśyapa, along with Uruvilvā-Kāśyapa, Gayā-Kāśyapa, and Nadī-Kāśyapa.

In all, there were twelve thousand such monks gathered together. They were all Arhats who had exhausted all defilements (*āsrava*), were free from all bonds, and had attained true and proper liberation.

---

## IV. Great Adornment’s Offering and the Verse of Praise

At that time, the bodhisattva-mahāsattva Great Adornment, having observed that the assembly was settled in their minds, rose from his seat with the eighty thousand other bodhisattvas. They approached the Buddha, bowed their heads at His feet, and circled Him a hundred thousand times.

They scattered heavenly flowers, incense, robes, and priceless jeweled necklaces as offerings. These treasures descended from the sky like clouds gathering from the four directions. Heavenly kitchens overflowed with a hundred flavors; just the sight and scent brought spontaneous satisfaction. Banners, canopies, and celestial instruments were placed everywhere, and they performed heavenly music to delight the Buddha.

Great Adornment Bodhisattva then knelt, joined his palms with one mind, and along with the assembly, spoke this verse of praise:

### The Song of the Great Awakened One

> Great indeed is the Great Awakened One, the Holy Lord!
> Without stain, without defilement, without attachment.
> The teacher of gods, humans, and the tamers of elephants and horses,
> His virtue-fragrance perfumes all, his path-wind blows through the world.
>
> His wisdom is tranquil, his emotions calm, his thoughts settled in stillness.
> With intention ceased and consciousness extinguished, his mind is at rest.
> Forever severed from false dreams and wandering thoughts,
> He is no longer bound by the aggregates, the sense-realms, or the gateways of entry.
>
> His body is neither existence nor non-existence,
> Neither caused nor conditioned, neither self nor other.
> Neither square nor round, neither short nor long,
> Neither appearing nor disappearing, neither born nor dying.
>
> He does not act, does not arise, does not create,
> He neither sits nor lies, neither walks nor stands.
> He neither moves nor turns, is neither busy nor still,
> He neither advances nor retreats, is neither safe nor in danger.
>
> Neither right nor wrong, neither gain nor loss,
> Neither that nor this, neither going nor coming.
> He is not blue, not yellow, not red, not white,
> Not crimson, not purple, nor any of a thousand hues.
>
> Yet from morality, meditation, wisdom, and liberation,
> From the clarity of vision and knowledge, he arises.
> The three clarities, the six powers, and the path-factors emerge,
> He springs forth from the compassion and good karma of living beings.
>
> He manifests as the purple-golden form, sixteen feet in height,
> Radiating a brilliant and penetrating light.
> The moon-like mark between his brows, the sun-like radiance from his neck,
> His hair spiraling in deep indigo, the crown of his head raised high.
>
> His eyes shine clear, observing above and below,
> His eyebrows are as indigo clouds, his face and cheeks square and upright.
> His lips and tongue are vermillion like the bimba fruit,
> His forty white teeth are like snow-covered shells.
>
> His forehead is broad, his nose high, his countenance open.
> On his chest is the swastika, his breast is like a lion’s.
> His hands and feet are soft, marked with the thousand-spoked wheels,
> His palms and armpits are perfectly webbed, smooth inside and out.
>
> His arms are long, his elbows lengthy, his fingers straight and slender.
> His skin is fine and soft, his body-hair curls to the right.
> His ankles and knees are concealed, his organ withdrawn like a horse’s.
> His sinews are fine, his bones locked, his calves like a deer’s.
>
> Transparent within and without, he is pure and without stain,
> Untouched by dust, unmoistened by water.
> Such are the thirty-two marks and eighty minor signs,
> Though they appear visible, they are beyond the reach of the eye.
>
> He is the markless mark, the marked body that is non-body.
> And the forms of all living beings are likewise so.
> He causes all beings to rejoice and bow in reverence,
> Through this sincere respect, their pride and arrogance are removed.
>
> We and all eighty thousand gathered here,
> Together bow our heads and take refuge in the Holy Sage,
> Who has extinguished all thoughts, mind, and consciousness,
> The unattached trainer of gods and men.
>
> We take refuge in the Dharma-body of the Law,
> The gathering of morality, meditation, wisdom, and liberation.
> We take refuge in the wonderful marks of the Banner-One,
> We take refuge in the Inconceivable One.
>
> His voice is like Brahma’s thunder, sounding in eight modes,
> Subtle, pure, profound, and far-reaching.
> He turns the Wheel of the Four Truths, the Six Perfections, and Twelve Links,
> According to the minds and karma of all living beings.
>
> All who hear him have their minds and hearts opened,
> Breaking the immeasurable bonds of birth and death.
> Some attain stream-entry, some the once-returner’s path,
> Some the non-returner, and some the rank of Arhat.
>
> Some attain the unconditioned place of solitary awakening,
> Or the unborn, undying ground of the Bodhisattva.
> Some attain immeasurable dharanis and eloquent speech,
> Proclaiming profound and subtle verses.
>
> Some manifest spiritual powers, flying or walking through fire and water,
> Their bodies free from all limitations.
> Such is the turning of the Dharma-wheel,
> Pure, limitless, and inconceivable.
>
> We take refuge in the Brahma-voice,
> We take refuge in the truths, the conditions, and the perfections.
> For we know the World-Honored One, through immeasurable eons past,
> Diligently and painfully cultivated every virtuous act.
>
> For our sake—for humans, gods, dragons, and spirit-kings—
> And for every living being in the ten directions,
> He gave up all that is hard to give up:
> Wealth, treasures, family, and kingdoms.
>
> He held nothing back, inside or out,
> Giving even his head, eyes, marrow, and brain to others.
> He upheld the pure precepts of all Buddhas,
> Even at the cost of his life.
>
> Though struck with weapons or insulted with harsh words, he never felt anger.
> Through eons of effort, he never grew weary of the path.
> Day and night he collected his mind in meditation,
> Penetrating deep into the roots of all beings.
>
> Therefore, he has attained supreme mastery and freedom of mind,
> Sovereign in the Law as the King of the Dharma.
> We all together bow our heads in reverence,
> Taking refuge in the One who endured all that is hard to endure.

## V. Philosophical Commentary & Scholarly Apparatus

### Technical Terms & Philological Notes

1.  **Still and Clear (靜寂清澄, *jìngjì qingchéng*)**: This couplet describes the ontological state of the bodhisattva's mind. It corresponds to the Sanskrit *śānta-praśānta* or similar formulations of deep meditational stillness (*śamatha*).
2.  **Aspirations Profound and Vast (志玄虛漠, *jìngjì qingchéng*)**: A key IMS phrase describing the "emptiness-nature" of the enlightened will. The term *xuán* (mysterious/profound) echoes Daoist terminology used by early Chinese translators to map the Buddhist concept of *śūnyatā* (emptiness) or *gambhīra* (profound).
3.  **Dharma-body (法身, *dharmakāya*)**: In Mahayana thought, the *dharmakāya* is the ultimate reality or the essence of the Buddha's enlightenment, as opposed to the physical body (*rūpakāya*) or the enjoyment body (*saṃbhogakāya*).
4.  **Five Components of the Dharma-body (五分法身)**: Morality, Meditation, Wisdom, Liberation, and Knowledge/Vision of Liberation. These represent the "perfuming" of the ascetic's being with the qualities of enlightenment.
5.  **The Markless Mark (無相之相)**: A classic Mahayana paradox. It asserts that the physical form of the Buddha is a manifestation of the formless reality (*tathatā*), and thus is empty of inherent existence yet perfectly functional for the sake of teaching.

### Cross-References & Canonical Links

*   **Lotus Sutra Parallel**: The list of arhats and bodhisattvas closely parallels the opening of the *Lotus Sutra* (Chapter 1), reinforcing the IMS's role as a prologue to the "Wonderful Dharma."
*   **The Four Characteristics (四相)**: Arising, Abiding, Changing, and Ceasing. These are hinted at in the bodhisattvas' understanding of "existence and non-existence" and will be expanded upon in Chapter 2.
*   **Brahma-voice (*brahmasvara*)**: The Buddha's voice is said to have sixty-four qualities in some traditions, categorized here into "eight modes" (*bāyīn*), signifying its perfect resonance and clarity across all linguistic and cognitive boundaries.

# CHAPTER TWO: PREACHING THE DHARMA (Shuo Fa Pin)

## I. The Question of Great Adornment

At that time, the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Great Adornment (*Mahā-alaṃkāra*), along with the eighty thousand bodhisattva-mahāsattvas, having finished praising the Buddha with these verses, addressed the Buddha in unison:

"World-Honored One! We eighty thousand bodhisattvas now wish to ask a question regarding the Dharma of the Tathāgata. We do not know if the World-Honored One would grant us compassion and listen?"

The Buddha said to Great Adornment Bodhisattva and the eighty thousand bodhisattvas: "Excellent, excellent! Good men (*kulaputras*)! You know well that now is the time. Ask whatever you wish. Before long, the Tathāgata will enter Parinirvāṇa. After Nirvana, let there be no remaining doubts among anyone. What you wish to ask, you may speak now."

Then, Great Adornment Bodhisattva and the eighty thousand bodhisattvas spoke to the Buddha with one voice: "World-Honored One! If a Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva wishes to quickly attain Supreme Perfect Enlightenment (*Anuttarā-Samyak-Saṃbodhi*), what Dharma-door (*dharmaparyāya*) should he cultivate? What Dharma-door is capable of causing a Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva to quickly attain Supreme Perfect Enlightenment?"

The Buddha told Great Adornment Bodhisattva and the eighty thousand bodhisattvas: "Good men! There is one Dharma-door which can cause a Bodhisattva to quickly attain Supreme Perfect Enlightenment. If a Bodhisattva learns this Dharma-door, he will quickly attain Supreme Perfect Enlightenment."

"World-Honored One! What is this Dharma-door called? What is its meaning? And how should a Bodhisattva cultivate it?"

## II. The Core Teaching: Immeasurable Meanings

The Buddha said: "Good men! This Dharma-door is called **Immeasurable Meanings** (*Ananta-nirdeśa*). A Bodhisattva who wishes to cultivate the study of Immeasurable Meanings should observe that all dharmas (*sarvadharma*), from the very beginning until now, are in their nature and characteristics empty and tranquil (*śūnya-śānta*).

They are:
*   Without magnitude (no 'great' or 'small').
*   Without arising or ceasing (*anutpāda-anirodha*).
*   Neither abiding nor moving.
*   Neither advancing nor retreating.

Like empty space, they possess no duality. Yet, all living beings, in their delusion and falsehood, arbitrarily calculate distinctions: 'This is that,' 'This is gain,' 'This is loss.' They give rise to unwholesome thoughts, create varied evil karma, and cycle through the six destinies (*gati*), suffering all manner of poisons and pain. For immeasurable millions of eons, they cannot liberate themselves.

Great Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas, observing this reality (*tattvato*), generate a mind of pity (*karuṇā*) and give rise to great compassion (*mahākaruṇā*), desiring to save and pull them out.

Further, they penetrate deeply into all dharmas:
*   For such a characteristic of a dharma, such a dharma arises.
*   For such a characteristic of a dharma, such a dharma abides.
*   For such a characteristic of a dharma, such a dharma changes (*anyathā*).
*   For such a characteristic of a dharma, such a dharma ceases (*nirodha*).

*   For such a characteristic of a dharma, unwholesome dharma arises.
*   For such a characteristic of a dharma, wholesome dharma arises.
*   Arising, abiding, changing, and ceasing are also like this.

Bodhisattvas, having thus observed these **Four Characteristics** (*catuḥ-lakṣaṇa*) from beginning to end and completely understanding them, next contemplate that all dharmas do not abide for even a distinct moment (*kṣana*); they arise and perish anew in every moment.

Having contemplated nature, arising, abiding, changing, and ceasing, they enter into the various capacities and desires of living beings. Because desires are immeasurable, the preaching of the Dharma is immeasurable. Because the preaching of the Dharma is immeasurable, the meanings are also immeasurable.

**Immeasurable Meanings are born from One Law.**
That **One Law** is **Non-Form** (*Animitta* / *Wuxiang*).
Such Non-Form is 'Non-Form yet Not Non-Form' (*wuxiang buxiang*).
Not-Form and Non-Form—this is called the **True Aspect** (*Real Mark* / *Shixian*).

When Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas abide in this True Aspect (*Bhūtatathatā*), the compassion they generate is clear and true, never false. For sentient beings, it can truly pull out suffering. Once suffering is pulled out, they preach the Dharma for them, causing all living beings to receive happiness.

Good men! If a Bodhisattva can thus cultivate this Dharma-door of Immeasurable Meanings, he will certainly quickly attain Supreme Perfect Enlightenment. Good men! This profound, supreme Great Vehicle *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra* is structurally true and correct; its worth is unsurpassed. It is protected by the Buddhas of the three times. No demons or heretics can enter into it, nor can it be destroyed by any wrong views of birth and death. Therefore, good men! If a Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva wishes to quickly attain Supreme Enlightenment, he should cultivate and study this profound, supreme Great Vehicle *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra*."

## III. The Question of Difference (The "Forty Years" Dilemma)

At that time, Great Adornment Bodhisattva addressed the Buddha again: "World-Honored One! The Dharma preached by the World-Honored One is inconceivable. The capacities of living beings are also inconceivable. The liberation of Dharma-doors is also inconceivable. regarding the dharmas preached by the Buddha, we have no further doubts. However, sentient beings give rise to confused minds, so I must ask again.

World-Honored One! Since the Tathāgata obtained the Way forty-some years ago, he has constantly preached to living beings the meaning of the Four Characteristics of dharmas:
*   Suffering (*duḥkha*)
*   Emptiness (*śūnyatā*)
*   Impermanence (*anitya*)
*   Non-self (*anātman*)
*   No great, no small; no arising, no ceasing.
*   Everything is markless (*animitta*).
*   The nature and characteristics of dharmas are originally empty and tranquil.
*   No coming, no going; no exiting, no appearing.

Those who heard this attained the 'Warmth' stage, the 'Peak' stage, the 'Supreme Worldly' stage; the fruit of Stream-Entry (*Srotāpanna*), Once-Returner (*Sakṛdāgāmin*), Non-Returner (*Anāgāmin*), and Arhat (*Arhat*); the Way of the Pratyekabuddha; or engaged the Bodhi-mind (*Bodhicitta*) ascending from the first ground to the tenth ground.

What is the difference between the meaning of the dharmas preached in those past days and the dharma preached today? Why do you say that by cultivating the profound, supreme Great Vehicle *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra*, a Bodhisattva will 'certainly quickly attain supreme Bodhi'? How is this so? We only wish the World-Honored One would, out of compassion for all, distinguish this broadly for living beings, so that those hearing the Dharma in the present and future will have no remaining net of doubt."

## IV. The Buddha's River Metaphor

Thereupon, the Buddha told Great Adornment Bodhisattva: "Excellent, excellent! Great Good Man! You are able to ask the Tathāgata about this profound, supreme, subtle meaning of the Great Vehicle. You should know that you can bring much benefit and peace to humans and gods, pulling out the suffering of beings. This is true great kindness and compassion, faithful and not false. Because of this cause and condition, you will certainly quickly attain supreme Bodhi, and also cause all beings of the present and future to attain supreme Bodhi.

Good man! Since I sat beneath the Bodhi tree in the place of the Way (*bodhimaṇḍa*) and after six years attainable Supreme Perfect Enlightenment, I observed with the Buddha-eye that none of the dharmas could be declared [directly]. Why? Because the natures and desires of living beings are different.

*   Because natures and desires are different, I preached the Dharma in various ways.
*   Preaching in various ways, through the power of **skillful means** (*upāya*), for forty-some years I have **not yet revealed the Truth** (*wei ceng xian shi*).

Therefore, the way attained by living beings is differentiated, and they do not quickly attain supreme Bodhi.

Good man! The Dharma is like water: it can wash away grime and filth. Whether it is a well, a pond, a stream, a river, a canal, or a great ocean—all can wash away grime and filth. The water of the Dharma is also like this: it can wash away the grime of the afflictions (*kleśa*) of living beings.

Good man! The nature of water is one, but a river, stream, well, pond, canal, and ocean are each different.
The nature of the Dharma is also like this: washing away the dust of labor is no different, but the Three Laws (*Three Vehicles*), Four Fruits, and Two Ways are not one.

Good man! Although the water washes equally:
*   A well is not a pond.
*   A pond is not a river or stream.
*   A river or stream is not the ocean.

As the World Heo (*Lokajyeṣṭha*) is sovereign in the Dharma, the dharmas he preaches are also like this. The Initial, Middle, and Later preachings can all wash away the afflictions of living beings. However:
*   The Initial is not the Middle.
*   The Middle is not the Later.

The Initial, Middle, and Later preachings—though the expressions are the same, the meanings are different (*yi ge yi*).

## V. The Three Periods of Teaching

Good man! When I arose from the King of Trees and went to the Deer Park in Vārāṇasī, turning the Wheel of the Four Noble Truths for Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya and the five ascetics, I also said: 'All dharmas are originally empty and tranquil, continuously metabolizing (*daixie*) and not abiding, arising and perishing in every thought.'

In the middle period, at this place and various other places, debating and proclaiming the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination and the Six Perfections for the Bhikṣus and Bodhisattvas, I also said: 'All dharmas are originally empty and tranquil, continuously metabolizing and not abiding, arising and perishing in every thought.'

Now, arriving here to proclaim the Great Vehicle *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra*, I *also* say: 'All dharmas are originally empty and tranquil, continuously metabolizing and not abiding, arising and perishing in every thought.'

Good man! Therefore: **The Initial Preaching, the Middle Preaching, and the Present Preaching—the expressions are one, but the meanings differ.**

Because the meanings differ, the understanding of living beings differs.
Because the understanding differs, the Attainment of Dharma, the Attainment of Fruit, and the Attainment of the Way also differ.

*   **Initial Period:** I preached the Four Truths for those seeking to be **Śrāvakas**. Yet 800 million heavenly beings came down to listen and generated the Bodhi-mind.
*   **Middle Period:** I preached the Twelve Links for those seeking to be **Pratyekabuddhas**. Yet immeasurable beings generated the Bodhi-mind, or abided in the Śrāvaka stage.
*   **Later (Vaipulya) Period:** I preached the twelve divisions of scripture, the *Mahā-Prajñā*, and the *Avataṃsaka* Ocean-Cloud, explaining the Bodhisattva's practice through eons. Yet hundreds of thousands of monks and millions of humans and gods attained the fruits of [the Arhat] or abided in the Pratyekabuddha dharma.

Good man! By this meaning, know that *the preaching is the same, but the meaning varies*.
Thus, good man! Since I attained the Way, from the first preaching until today's *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra*, I have never *not* preached suffering, emptiness, impermanence, non-self; not real, not false; not great, not small; originally unborn, and now not extinguishing; all formless (*wuxiang*); the nature and characteristics of dharmas neither coming nor going. Yet living beings are moved by the four characteristics [or arising, abiding, changing, ceasing].

Good man! This is why the Buddhas have no double-speech. They can respond to all voices with a single sound. With one body, they show bodies as numerous as the sands of the Ganges... This is the inconceivable profound realm of the Buddhas, not known by the Two Vehicles, nor reachable by Bodhisattvas of the Ten Abodes. Only a Buddha and a Buddha can fathom it thoroughly.

Good man! Therefore I say: The subtle, profound, supreme Great Vehicle *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra* is structurally true and correct... If a Bodhisattva wants to quickly attain Supreme Bodhi, he should cultivate this Sutra."

## VI. The Miraculous Confirmation

When the Buddha finished speaking, the three-thousand great-thousand world system shook in six ways. Spontaneously, various heavenly flowers rained from the sky... [The text describes the rain of flowers, incense, robes, and offerings from the heavens].

Then, in the assembly, thirty-two thousand Bodhisattva-mahāsattvas attained the **Immeasurable Meanings Samādhi**.
Thirty-four thousand Bodhisattvas attained countless Dharani-doors and could turn the non-retrogressive Dharma wheel...
[The text lists the attainments of the various monks, nuns, laypeople, and heavenly beings: attaining the Four Fruits, the Non-Arising Dharma Patience, and various numbers of Dharanis.]

Immeasurable living beings generated the mind of Supreme Perfect Enlightenment.

## VII. Philosophical Commentary & Scholarly Apparatus

### Technical Terms & Philological Notes

1.  **Immeasurable Meanings (*Ananta-nirdeśa* / *Wúliángyì*)**: The central concept of this sutra. It signifies that from the single fundamental truth (Emptiness/One Mind), infinite specific teachings and meanings emerge. This justifies the diversity of Buddhist scriptures as adaptations of a single truth.
2.  **Not yet revealed the Truth (*wei ceng xian shi*)**: A critical phrase (Line 105) often cited by Nichiren and Tiantai scholars. It explicitly demarcates the *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra* (and implicitly the *Lotus Sutra* which follows) as the "Truth" (*shi*), relegating the previous 40 years of teaching to "Skillful Means" (*quán*).
3.  **Metabolizing (*daixie*)**: A biological or cyclical metaphor used here to describe the constant flux of mental and physical dharmas. It implies a 'replacement' or 'succession' rather than mere destruction.
4.  **One Law (*Yi Fa*)**: In Tiantai philosophy, this is identified as the **True Aspect** (*Shi Xiang*). It is the source from which all other meanings (provisional teachings) manifest.
5.  **Three Laws / Three Vehicles**: The Buddha explicitly states here that water (Dharma nature) is one, but the specific manifestations (well, pond, river) are different. This corresponds to the Three Vehicles (Śrāvaka, Pratyekabuddha, Bodhisattva) which are distinct provisional paths leading to the One Vehicle.

### Doctrinal Analysis (Tiantai Perspective)

This chapter is crucial for the Tiantai classification of the teachings (*panjiao*). It provides the scriptural evidence for the **"Opening the Provisional to Reveal the Real"**.

*   **The Paradox:** The Buddha admits he has used the *same words* (Empty, Tranquil, Non-Arising) for 40 years.
*   **The Resolution:** Although the *words* were the same, the *meaning* (*yi*) intended was different based on the audience's capacity.
    *   **Context A (Hīnayāna):** "Empty" meant specifically the absence of a permanent self (*ātman*).
    *   **Context B (Prajñā/Wisdom):** "Empty" meant the lack of intrinsic nature (*svabhāva*) in all phenomena.
    *   **Context C (Lotus/Immeasurable):** "Empty" refers to the *Dynamic Potentiality* of the One Mind to manifest infinite meanings.

This validates Zhiyi's "Five Periods" classification, placing this sutra at the very threshold of the Lotus Sutra period (the "Real").

# CHAPTER THREE: TEN MERITS (Shi Gong De Pin)

## I. The Source and Destination of the Sutra

At that time, Great Adornment Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva again addressed the Buddha, saying: "World-Honored One! The *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra* preached by the World-Honored One is subtle, profound, and unsurpassed! It is truly profound! Profound, profound!

Why is this? In this assembly, all the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas and the four groups, as well as gods, dragons, ghosts, spirits, kings, ministers, and citizens who heard this profound, supreme Great Vehicle *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra*, without exception obtained the Dharani-doors, the Three Laws (*Trīṇi Dharmāṇi*), the Four Fruits (*Caturphala*), and the Bodhi-mind (*Bodhicitta*).

We should know that this Sutra is structurally true and correct; its worth is unsurpassed. It is protected by the Buddhas of the three times. No demons or heretics can enter into it, nor can it be destroyed by any wrong views of birth and death. Why? Because hearing it once encompasses all dharmas!

If sentient beings can hear this Sutra, it is a great benefit. Why? If they can cultivate it, they will certainly quickly attain Supreme Perfect Enlightenment. Those living beings who cannot hear it should be known as losing a great benefit. Even after passing through immeasurable, boundless, inconceivable *asaṃkhyeya* eons, they will ultimately not attain Supreme Perfect Enlightenment. Why? Not knowing the Great Path to Bodhi is direct, they walk on dangerous paths and encounter many obstructions.

World-Honored One! This classic is inconceivable. We only wish the World-Honored One would, out of compassion for the great assembly, widely proclaim the profound inconceivable matters of this Sutra. World-Honored One! Regarding this classic:
**From where does it come?**
**To where does it go?**
**Where does it abide?**
That it possesses such immeasurable merit and inconceivable power, causing the assembly to quickly attain Supreme Perfect Enlightenment?"

Then the World-Honored One addressed Great Adornment Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva: "Excellent, excellent! Good man! It is as you say, as you say. Good man! I say this Sutra is profound, profound! Truly profound! Why? Because it causes the assembly to quickly attain Supreme Perfect Enlightenment; because hearing it once encompasses all dharmas; because it greatly benefits all living beings; because it walks the Great Direct Path (*Maha-ṛju-mārga*) without obstruction.

Good man! You asked: 'From where does this Sutra come? To where does it go? Where does it abide?' Listen closely with goodness.

Good man!
*   **Source:** This Sutra originally comes from the palace of the Buddhas (*Buddha-gṛha*).
*   **Destination:** It goes to the impulse to generate the Bodhi-mind in all living beings.
*   **Abode:** It abides in the practice place of all Bodhisattvas.

Good man! This Sutra comes intimately like this, goes like this, and abides like this. Therefore, this Sutra possesses such immeasurable merit and inconceivable power, causing the assembly to quickly attain Supreme Perfect Enlightenment.

Good man! Would you like to hear the **Ten Inconceivable Merit Powers** of this Sutra?"

Great Adornment said: "We eagerly wish to hear."

## II. The Ten Inconceivable Merit Powers

### The First Merit: Transforming the Mind

The Buddha said: "Good man!
**First:** This Sutra can cause Bodhisattvas who have not generated the mind to generate the Bodhi-mind.
*   Those without kindness generate a kind mind.
*   Those who love slaughter generate a mind of great compassion.
*   Those who generate jealousy generate a mind of joyful correspondence (*muditā*).
*   Those with attachment generate a mind of renunciation (*upekṣā*).

Good man! This is called the First Merit and Inconceivable Power of this Sutra."

### The Second Merit: One Law Encompasses All

"Good man!
**Second:** As for the inconceivable merit power of this Sutra: If a living being obtains this Sutra—whether one revolution, one verse, or even one phrase—they will penetrate a hundred thousand million meanings. Even in immeasurable eons, they could not fully explain the Dharma they have received and held. Why? Because the meaning of this Dharma is immeasurable.

Good man! This Sutra is like a **single seed** that produces a hundred thousand. Each of those hundred thousand produces another hundred thousand. Spinning forth like this, it reaches immeasurable numbers. This classic is also like this: from **One Law** it produces a hundred thousand meanings. From each of those hundred thousand meanings, another hundred thousand are produced. Spinning forth like this, it reaches immeasurable, boundless meanings. Therefore, this Sutra is called **Immeasurable Meanings**.

Good man! This is called the Second Merit and Inconceivable Power of this Sutra."

### The Third Merit: Power Despite Affliction

"Good man!
**Third:** If a living being hears this Sutra—whether one revolution, one verse, or even one phrase—and penetrates a hundred thousand million meanings... **Although they still have afflictions, it is as if they have no afflictions.** Moving through birth and death, they have no thought of fear. Towards all living beings, they generate a mind of pity. Regarding all dharmas, they obtain the thought of bravery.

Like a strong wrestler who can shoulder heavy loads, this Sutra-holder can shoulder the heavy treasure of Supreme Bodhi and carry living beings out of the path of birth and death. **Although they have not yet saved themselves, they are already able to save others.**

*   *Simile of the Ferryman:* Just as a ferryman who is sick and disabled, resting on this shore, possesses a sturdy boat and the tools of crossing, enabling others to cross.
*   *Application:* The Sutra-holder is also like this. Although their body suffers the five destinies (*gati*) and is constantly bound by 108 heavy illnesses, resting on the shore of ignorance, old age, and death—because they possess this sturdy Great Vehicle Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings, they can save living beings. Those who practice as they say attain liberation from birth and death.

Good man! This is called the Third Merit and Inconceivable Power of this Sutra."

### The Fourth Merit: The Newborn Prince

"Good man!
**Fourth:** If a living being... obtains the thought of bravery... and speaks widely for others: Good man! This person is like a newborn prince of the King and Queen. Whether one day, two days... or seven years old—although he cannot yet manage the affairs of state, strictly speaking he is already respected by the ministers and people... Why? Because he is young [and of the royal line].

Good man! The Sutra-holder is also like this. The King is the Buddhas; the Queen is this Sutra. Coming together, they give birth to this Bodhisattva-son. If this Bodhisattva hears this Sutra... **although he cannot yet embody the ultimate truth** (*tǐ zhēn lǐ jí*), nor shake the billion worlds... **Strictly speaking he is already respected by all the four groups and eight classes of beings.** He penetrates deeply into the secret Dharma of the Buddhas... always protected and mindful of the Buddhas, covered by their kindness because he is a new student.

Good man! This is called the Fourth Merit and Inconceivable Power of this Sutra."

### The Fifth Merit: Transformation of Time

"Good man!
**Fifth:** If good men or good women, during the Buddha's lifetime or after his extinction... uphold this Sutra... although they are fettered by afflictions and cannot distance themselves from the affairs of ordinary people, they can demonstrate the Great Bodhi Way. They extend one day into a hundred eons; they compress a hundred eons into one day...

Like the dragon's child: born only seven days, yet appearing like a cloud and capable of bringing rain.

Good man! This is called the Fifth Merit and Inconceivable Power of this Sutra."

### The Sixth Merit: Reducing Affliction

"Good man!
**Sixth:** If good men or good women... although possessing afflictions, preach the Dharma for living beings... causing them to sever all suffering...

Like the Prince: although young, if the King travels or is ill, he entrusts the Prince to manage state affairs... The people are at peace, just as if the Great King were ruling.

The Sutra-holder is also like this. Although they have not yet attained the **First Stage of Immobility** (*Avinivartanīya* / *Fūdòngdì*), relying on the Buddha's teaching... living beings hearing it sever afflictions... as if being taught by the Buddha Tathāgata without difference.

Good man! This is called the Sixth Merit and Inconceivable Power of this Sutra."

### The Seventh Merit: The Six Perfections Spontaneous

"Good man!
**Seventh:** If good men or good women... hearing this Sutra... conceive a rare thought (*adbhuta-citta*)... Although they have not cultivated the Six Perfections (*Pāramitās*), the Six Perfections spontaneously appear before them. In this very body they obtain the patience of non-arising (*anutpattika-dharma-kṣānti*). The afflictions of birth and death are severed in a moment. They ascend to the Seventh Ground.

Like a fierce warrior eradicating the King's enemies... the King joyfully grants him half the kingdom...

The Sutra-holder... the enemies of birth and death naturally scatter... attaining the outcome of half the Buddha-land's treasure.

Good man! This is called the Seventh Merit and Inconceivable Power of this Sutra."

### The Eighth Merit: Reversing the Skeptics

"Good man!
**Eighth:** ...If someone does not believe there is sin or blessing... [the Sutra-holder] shows them this Sutra... forcefully causing them to believe. By the power of the Sutra, their hearts open and turn back (*huí*). Once faith arises... they can attain the Way and the Fruit.

Therefore, good men and good women, in this very body, can attain the patience of non-arising, attain the Upper Grounds (*Upper Bhūmis*), and become retinues of the Bodhisattvas...

Good man! This is called the Eighth Merit and Inconceivable Power of this Sutra."

### The Ninth Merit: Cleansing Karma

"Good man!
**Ninth:** ...Heavy hindrances and residue of past karma are destroyed in a moment (*yīshí mièjìn*)... They become pure... attain great eloquence... enter the Great Dhāraṇī-door... quickly transcending to the Upper Grounds. They are able to divide their bodies (*kāya-vibhāga*) to pervade the lands of the ten directions... saving all beings suffering in the twenty-five forms of existence.

Good man! This is called the Ninth Merit and Inconceivable Power of this Sutra."

### The Tenth Merit: The Great Reservoir

"Good man!
**Tenth:** ...If they obtain this Sutra... and vastly exhort lay and monastic people to uphold it... these good men and good women, in this very body, attain immeasurable Dhāraṇī-doors. In the stage of ordinary beings (*pṛthagjana*), naturally at the initial time, they generate numberless *asaṃkhyeya* great vows... deeply saving all... thickly accumulating good roots...

They act as a great reservoir of Dharma provided to all... soothing and comforting all... gradually causing them to ascend to abide in the **Dharma Cloud Ground** (*Dharmameghā-bhūmi*, the 10th Ground). Their grace and moisture pervade everywhere... causing suffering beings to enter the path-traces.

Therefore, this person will before long attain Supreme Perfect Enlightenment. Good man! This is called the Tenth Merit and Inconceivable Power of this Sutra."

## III. Conclusion and Entrustment

"Good man! This supreme Great Vehicle *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra* possesses extreme awe-inspiring spiritual power (*mahā-ṛddhi-bala*). Its worth is unsurpassed. It can cause all ordinary beings to become Sages (*ārya*), forever leaving birth and death to obtain sovereignty (*aishvarya*). Therefore, this Sutra is called **Immeasurable Meanings**. It can cause the buds of the Way (*bodhi-aṅkura*) of all Bodhisattvas to sprout in the ground of ordinary beings, making the tree of merit lush, widespread, and growing."

Thereupon, Great Adornment Bodhisattva... said: "World-Honored One! This Sutra is wonderful... The World-Honored One's compassion is indeed hard to repay."

At that time, the three-thousand great-thousand world system shook in six ways... [Further description of heavenly flowers and offerings]...

The Buddha told Great Adornment Bodhisattva: "You should generate a deep mind of respect for this Sutra... widely circulate it... do not let it stagnate. In the future age, you must cause it to be practiced widely in Jambudvīpa... causing all to see, hear, read, recite, write, and offer to it. By this cause, you will also quickly attain Supreme Perfect Enlightenment."

Great Adornment Bodhisattva... vowed: "World-Honored One! Do not worry... We will use our vow-power to widely cause all living beings to see, hear, read, recite, write, and offer to this Sutra..."

The Buddha praised them: "Excellent! You are truly sons of the Buddha... the great field of blessings for all living beings..."

At that time, the great assembly rejoiced greatly, paid reverence to the Buddha, accepted and upheld the teaching, and departed.

## IV. Philosophical Commentary & Scholarly Apparatus

### Technical Terms & Philological Notes

1.  **Dharani-doors (*dhāraṇī-mukha*)**: "Whatever one hears, one holds and does not lose." The ability to retain and integrate infinite teachings.
2.  **Immeasurable Meanings Samādhi (*anantanirdeśa-pratiṣṭhāna-samādhi*)**: The specific meditative absorption attained by the assembly. It is the state where the "One Law" acts as the source for infinite applications.
3.  **Ordinary Being (*pṛthagjana*)**: The sutra repeatedly emphasizes that one can attain these merits *while still being an ordinary being with afflictions*. This anticipates the "Identity in Practice" (*guānxhíng jí*) stage of Tiantai's **Six Identities**, where the realization is profound but the habits of defilement remain.

### The Ten Merits (Summary Analysis)

The "Ten Merits" chapter is structurally critical as it bridges the "Theory" of Chapter 2 (Emptiness/One Law) with the "Practice" of the Lotus Sutra.

*   **Merits 1-3 (Internal):** Transformation of the practitioner's own mind (*Bodhicitta*, Faith).
*   **Merits 4-6 (Relational):** The power of the practitioner to influence others despite their own immaturity (The Newborn Prince, The Sick Ferryman).
*   **Merits 7-10 (Transcendental):** The rapid ascent through the Bhūmis (Stages) and the attainment of supernatural powers (*ṛddhi*) and sovereignty (*aishvarya*).

**Note on the "Sick Ferryman" (Merit 3):** This is one of the most famous metaphors in East Asian Buddhism. It validates the bodhisattva practice of teaching and saving others *even before* one is fully enlightened oneself. It is a direct rebuttal to the Arhat ideal of "saving oneself first."

**Note on the "Newborn Prince" (Merit 4):** Represents the "Buddha-nature" or "Tathāgatagarbha" doctrine. The prince (Bodhisattva) has the royal lineage (Buddha-nature) and is thus worthy of respect even as an infant (beginner), unlike the ministers (Arhats) who are aged/experienced but not of the royal line.
