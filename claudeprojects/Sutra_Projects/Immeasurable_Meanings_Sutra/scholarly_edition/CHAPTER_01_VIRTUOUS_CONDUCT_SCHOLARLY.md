# CHAPTER ONE: VIRTUOUS CONDUCT

## I. The Assembly at Vulture Peak

Thus have I heard:

At one time, the Buddha was staying at Vulture Peak Mountain near the city of Rājagṛha, accompanied by a great assembly of twelve thousand monks. There were also eighty thousand bodhisattva-mahāsattvas, as well as gods (*devas*), dragons (*nāgas*), *yakṣas*, *gandharvas*, *asuras*, *garuḍas*, *kinnaras*, and *mahoragas*. Also in attendance were monks (*bhikṣus*), nuns (*bhikṣuṇīs*), laymen (*upāsakas*), and laywomen (*upāsikās*).

The assembly included great wheel-turning kings (*cakravartin*), minor wheel-turning kings, and kings of the gold, silver, and other realms. Princes, ministers, citizens, gentlemen, ladies, and great elders were each surrounded by hundreds of thousands of followers. They all approached the Buddha, bowed their heads at His feet, circled Him a hundred thousand times, and made various offerings of incense and flowers. After paying their respects, they withdrew and sat to one side.

### The Named Bodhisattvas

Among the bodhisattvas were the Dharma Princes Mañjuśrī, Great Majestic Virtue Treasury, Sorrowless Treasury, and Great Eloquence Treasury. There were also Maitreya Bodhisattva, Chief Guide Bodhisattva, Medicine King Bodhisattva, and Medicine Superior Bodhisattva.

Other prominent bodhisattvas included Flower Banner, Flower Light Banner, Dhāraṇī Self-Mastery King, Avalokiteśvara, Mahāsthāmaprāpta, Constant Vigor, Jewel Seal Hand, Jewel Accumulation, Jewel Staff, Transcending the Three Realms, Vimālavara, Fragrant Elephant, Great Fragrant Elephant, Lion’s Roar King, Lion Sport in the World, Lion’s Swift Advance, Lion’s Vigor, Brave and Sharp Power, Lion’s Majestic Subduing, Adornment, and Great Adornment Bodhisattva. In all, there were eighty thousand such bodhisattva-mahāsattvas gathered together.

## II. The Qualities of the Bodhisattvas

These bodhisattvas were all great beings (*mahāsattvas*) of the Dharma-body (*dharmakāya*), accomplished in morality (*śīla*), meditation (*samādhi*), wisdom (*prajñā*), liberation (*vimukti*), and the knowledge and vision of liberation (*vimukti-jñāna-darśana*). Their minds were tranquil and constantly dwelled in samādhi. They were calm, clear, and free from desire or artifice. Delusion and confused thoughts could no longer penetrate their minds.

They were still and clear (*jìngjì qingchéng*), their aspirations profound and vast (*zhì xuán xū mò*). They upheld this state unmoving (*shǒu zhī bùdòng*) for billions of eons. In this state, immeasurable Dharma-doors appeared before them. They attained great wisdom, penetrated all teachings, and clearly understood the true nature and characteristics of all things (*shì-xiàng zhēnshí*)—existence and non-existence, long and short—manifesting them with perfect clarity.

They understood the various capacities and desires of all beings. With the power of *dhāraṇī* and unobstructed eloquence, they requested the Buddha to turn the Wheel of Dharma, and they themselves could turn it in accordance with his teaching. Like the first drops of rain that moisten the dust of desire, they opened the gates of nirvana, fanned the winds of liberation, extinguished the world’s burning afflictions, and brought the cooling refreshment of the Dharma.

## III. The Assembled Arhats

Among the monks were: Great Wisdom Śāriputra, the miracle-worker Maudgalyāyana, the venerable Subhūti, Mahākātyāyana, Pūrṇa son of Maitrāyaṇī, and Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya. Also present were the celestial-eyed Aniruddha, the discipline-keeper Upāli, the attendant Ānanda, the Buddha’s son Rāhula, Upananda, Revata, Gavāṃpati, Bakkula, Acyuta, Svāgata, and the great ascetic Mahākāśyapa, along with Uruvilvā-Kāśyapa, Gayā-Kāśyapa, and Nadī-Kāśyapa.

In all, there were twelve thousand such monks gathered together. They were all Arhats who had exhausted all defilements (*āsrava*), were free from all bonds, and had attained true and proper liberation.

## IV. Great Adornment’s Offering and the Verse of Praise

At that time, the bodhisattva-mahāsattva Great Adornment, having observed that the assembly was settled in their minds, rose from his seat with the eighty thousand other bodhisattvas. They approached the Buddha, bowed their heads at His feet, and circled Him a hundred thousand times.

They scattered heavenly flowers, incense, robes, and priceless jeweled necklaces as offerings. These treasures descended from the sky like clouds gathering from the four directions. Heavenly kitchens overflowed with a hundred flavors; just the sight and scent brought spontaneous satisfaction. Banners, canopies, and celestial instruments were placed everywhere, and they performed heavenly music to delight the Buddha.

Great Adornment Bodhisattva then knelt, joined his palms with one mind, and along with the assembly, spoke this verse of praise:

### The Song of the Great Awakened One

> Great indeed is the Great Awakened One, the Holy Lord!
> Without stain, without defilement, without attachment.
> The teacher of gods, humans, and the tamers of elephants and horses,
> His virtue-fragrance perfumes all, his path-wind blows through the world.
>
> His wisdom is tranquil, his emotions calm, his thoughts settled in stillness.
> With intention ceased and consciousness extinguished, his mind is at rest.
> Forever severed from false dreams and wandering thoughts,
> He is no longer bound by the aggregates, the sense-realms, or the gateways of entry.
>
> His body is neither existence nor non-existence,
> Neither caused nor conditioned, neither self nor other.
> Neither square nor round, neither short nor long,
> Neither appearing nor disappearing, neither born nor dying.
>
> He does not act, does not arise, does not create,
> He neither sits nor lies, neither walks nor stands.
> He neither moves nor turns, is neither busy nor still,
> He neither advances nor retreats, is neither safe nor in danger.
>
> Neither right nor wrong, neither gain nor loss,
> Neither that nor this, neither going nor coming.
> He is not blue, not yellow, not red, not white,
> Not crimson, not purple, nor any of a thousand hues.
>
> Yet from morality, meditation, wisdom, and liberation,
> From the clarity of vision and knowledge, he arises.
> The three clarities, the six powers, and the path-factors emerge,
> He springs forth from the compassion and good karma of living beings.
>
> He manifests as the purple-golden form, sixteen feet in height,
> Radiating a brilliant and penetrating light.
> The moon-like mark between his brows, the sun-like radiance from his neck,
> His hair spiraling in deep indigo, the crown of his head raised high.
>
> His eyes shine clear, observing above and below,
> His eyebrows are as indigo clouds, his face and cheeks square and upright.
> His lips and tongue are vermillion like the bimba fruit,
> His forty white teeth are like snow-covered shells.
>
> His forehead is broad, his nose high, his countenance open.
> On his chest is the swastika, his breast is like a lion’s.
> His hands and feet are soft, marked with the thousand-spoked wheels,
> His palms and armpits are perfectly webbed, smooth inside and out.
>
> His arms are long, his elbows lengthy, his fingers straight and slender.
> His skin is fine and soft, his body-hair curls to the right.
> His ankles and knees are concealed, his organ withdrawn like a horse’s.
> His sinews are fine, his bones locked, his calves like a deer’s.
>
> Transparent within and without, he is pure and without stain,
> Untouched by dust, unmoistened by water.
> Such are the thirty-two marks and eighty minor signs,
> Though they appear visible, they are beyond the reach of the eye.
>
> He is the markless mark, the marked body that is non-body.
> And the forms of all living beings are likewise so.
> He causes all beings to rejoice and bow in reverence,
> Through this sincere respect, their pride and arrogance are removed.
>
> We and all eighty thousand gathered here,
> Together bow our heads and take refuge in the Holy Sage,
> Who has extinguished all thoughts, mind, and consciousness,
> The unattached trainer of gods and men.
>
> We take refuge in the Dharma-body of the Law,
> The gathering of morality, meditation, wisdom, and liberation.
> We take refuge in the wonderful marks of the Banner-One,
> We take refuge in the Inconceivable One.
>
> His voice is like Brahma’s thunder, sounding in eight modes,
> Subtle, pure, profound, and far-reaching.
> He turns the Wheel of the Four Truths, the Six Perfections, and Twelve Links,
> According to the minds and karma of all living beings.
>
> All who hear him have their minds and hearts opened,
> Breaking the immeasurable bonds of birth and death.
> Some attain stream-entry, some the once-returner’s path,
> Some the non-returner, and some the rank of Arhat.
>
> Some attain the unconditioned place of solitary awakening,
> Or the unborn, undying ground of the Bodhisattva.
> Some attain immeasurable dharanis and eloquent speech,
> Proclaiming profound and subtle verses.
>
> Some manifest spiritual powers, flying or walking through fire and water,
> Their bodies free from all limitations.
> Such is the turning of the Dharma-wheel,
> Pure, limitless, and inconceivable.
>
> We take refuge in the Brahma-voice,
> We take refuge in the truths, the conditions, and the perfections.
> For we know the World-Honored One, through immeasurable eons past,
> Diligently and painfully cultivated every virtuous act.
>
> For our sake—for humans, gods, dragons, and spirit-kings—
> And for every living being in the ten directions,
> He gave up all that is hard to give up:
> Wealth, treasures, family, and kingdoms.
>
> He held nothing back, inside or out,
> Giving even his head, eyes, marrow, and brain to others.
> He upheld the pure precepts of all Buddhas,
> Even at the cost of his life.
>
> Though struck with weapons or insulted with harsh words, he never felt anger.
> Through eons of effort, he never grew weary of the path.
> Day and night he collected his mind in meditation,
> Penetrating deep into the roots of all beings.
>
> Therefore, he has attained supreme mastery and freedom of mind,
> Sovereign in the Law as the King of the Dharma.
> We all together bow our heads in reverence,
> Taking refuge in the One who endured all that is hard to endure.

## V. Philosophical Commentary & Scholarly Apparatus

### Technical Terms & Philological Notes

1.  **Still and Clear (靜寂清澄, *jìngjì qingchéng*)**: This couplet describes the ontological state of the bodhisattva's mind. It corresponds to the Sanskrit *śānta-praśānta* or similar formulations of deep meditational stillness (*śamatha*).
2.  **Aspirations Profound and Vast (志玄虛漠, *jìngjì qingchéng*)**: A key IMS phrase describing the "emptiness-nature" of the enlightened will. The term *xuán* (mysterious/profound) echoes Daoist terminology used by early Chinese translators to map the Buddhist concept of *śūnyatā* (emptiness) or *gambhīra* (profound).
3.  **Dharma-body (法身, *dharmakāya*)**: In Mahayana thought, the *dharmakāya* is the ultimate reality or the essence of the Buddha's enlightenment, as opposed to the physical body (*rūpakāya*) or the enjoyment body (*saṃbhogakāya*).
4.  **Five Components of the Dharma-body (五分法身)**: Morality, Meditation, Wisdom, Liberation, and Knowledge/Vision of Liberation. These represent the "perfuming" of the ascetic's being with the qualities of enlightenment.
5.  **The Markless Mark (無相之相)**: A classic Mahayana paradox. It asserts that the physical form of the Buddha is a manifestation of the formless reality (*tathatā*), and thus is empty of inherent existence yet perfectly functional for the sake of teaching.

### Cross-References & Canonical Links

*   **Lotus Sutra Parallel**: The list of arhats and bodhisattvas closely parallels the opening of the *Lotus Sutra* (Chapter 1), reinforcing the IMS's role as a prologue to the "Wonderful Dharma."
*   **The Four Characteristics (四相)**: Arising, Abiding, Changing, and Ceasing. These are hinted at in the bodhisattvas' understanding of "existence and non-existence" and will be expanded upon in Chapter 2.
*   **Brahma-voice (*brahmasvara*)**: The Buddha's voice is said to have sixty-four qualities in some traditions, categorized here into "eight modes" (*bāyīn*), signifying its perfect resonance and clarity across all linguistic and cognitive boundaries.
