# CHAPTER TWO: PREACHING THE DHARMA (Shuo Fa Pin)

## I. The Question of Great Adornment

At that time, the Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva Great Adornment (*Mahā-alaṃkāra*), along with the eighty thousand bodhisattva-mahāsattvas, having finished praising the Buddha with these verses, addressed the Buddha in unison:

"World-Honored One! We eighty thousand bodhisattvas now wish to ask a question regarding the Dharma of the Tathāgata. We do not know if the World-Honored One would grant us compassion and listen?"

The Buddha said to Great Adornment Bodhisattva and the eighty thousand bodhisattvas: "Excellent, excellent! Good men (*kulaputras*)! You know well that now is the time. Ask whatever you wish. Before long, the Tathāgata will enter Parinirvāṇa. After Nirvana, let there be no remaining doubts among anyone. What you wish to ask, you may speak now."

Then, Great Adornment Bodhisattva and the eighty thousand bodhisattvas spoke to the Buddha with one voice: "World-Honored One! If a Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva wishes to quickly attain Supreme Perfect Enlightenment (*Anuttarā-Samyak-Saṃbodhi*), what Dharma-door (*dharmaparyāya*) should he cultivate? What Dharma-door is capable of causing a Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva to quickly attain Supreme Perfect Enlightenment?"

The Buddha told Great Adornment Bodhisattva and the eighty thousand bodhisattvas: "Good men! There is one Dharma-door which can cause a Bodhisattva to quickly attain Supreme Perfect Enlightenment. If a Bodhisattva learns this Dharma-door, he will quickly attain Supreme Perfect Enlightenment."

"World-Honored One! What is this Dharma-door called? What is its meaning? And how should a Bodhisattva cultivate it?"

## II. The Core Teaching: Immeasurable Meanings

The Buddha said: "Good men! This Dharma-door is called **Immeasurable Meanings** (*Ananta-nirdeśa*). A Bodhisattva who wishes to cultivate the study of Immeasurable Meanings should observe that all dharmas (*sarvadharma*), from the very beginning until now, are in their nature and characteristics empty and tranquil (*śūnya-śānta*).

They are:
*   Without magnitude (no 'great' or 'small').
*   Without arising or ceasing (*anutpāda-anirodha*).
*   Neither abiding nor moving.
*   Neither advancing nor retreating.

Like empty space, they possess no duality. Yet, all living beings, in their delusion and falsehood, arbitrarily calculate distinctions: 'This is that,' 'This is gain,' 'This is loss.' They give rise to unwholesome thoughts, create varied evil karma, and cycle through the six destinies (*gati*), suffering all manner of poisons and pain. For immeasurable millions of eons, they cannot liberate themselves.

Great Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas, observing this reality (*tattvato*), generate a mind of pity (*karuṇā*) and give rise to great compassion (*mahākaruṇā*), desiring to save and pull them out.

Further, they penetrate deeply into all dharmas:
*   For such a characteristic of a dharma, such a dharma arises.
*   For such a characteristic of a dharma, such a dharma abides.
*   For such a characteristic of a dharma, such a dharma changes (*anyathā*).
*   For such a characteristic of a dharma, such a dharma ceases (*nirodha*).

*   For such a characteristic of a dharma, unwholesome dharma arises.
*   For such a characteristic of a dharma, wholesome dharma arises.
*   Arising, abiding, changing, and ceasing are also like this.

Bodhisattvas, having thus observed these **Four Characteristics** (*catuḥ-lakṣaṇa*) from beginning to end and completely understanding them, next contemplate that all dharmas do not abide for even a distinct moment (*kṣana*); they arise and perish anew in every moment.

Having contemplated nature, arising, abiding, changing, and ceasing, they enter into the various capacities and desires of living beings. Because desires are immeasurable, the preaching of the Dharma is immeasurable. Because the preaching of the Dharma is immeasurable, the meanings are also immeasurable.

**Immeasurable Meanings are born from One Law.**
That **One Law** is **Non-Form** (*Animitta* / *Wuxiang*).
Such Non-Form is 'Non-Form yet Not Non-Form' (*wuxiang buxiang*).
Not-Form and Non-Form—this is called the **True Aspect** (*Real Mark* / *Shixian*).

When Bodhisattva-Mahāsattvas abide in this True Aspect (*Bhūtatathatā*), the compassion they generate is clear and true, never false. For sentient beings, it can truly pull out suffering. Once suffering is pulled out, they preach the Dharma for them, causing all living beings to receive happiness.

Good men! If a Bodhisattva can thus cultivate this Dharma-door of Immeasurable Meanings, he will certainly quickly attain Supreme Perfect Enlightenment. Good men! This profound, supreme Great Vehicle *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra* is structurally true and correct; its worth is unsurpassed. It is protected by the Buddhas of the three times. No demons or heretics can enter into it, nor can it be destroyed by any wrong views of birth and death. Therefore, good men! If a Bodhisattva-Mahāsattva wishes to quickly attain Supreme Enlightenment, he should cultivate and study this profound, supreme Great Vehicle *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra*."

## III. The Question of Difference (The "Forty Years" Dilemma)

At that time, Great Adornment Bodhisattva addressed the Buddha again: "World-Honored One! The Dharma preached by the World-Honored One is inconceivable. The capacities of living beings are also inconceivable. The liberation of Dharma-doors is also inconceivable. regarding the dharmas preached by the Buddha, we have no further doubts. However, sentient beings give rise to confused minds, so I must ask again.

World-Honored One! Since the Tathāgata obtained the Way forty-some years ago, he has constantly preached to living beings the meaning of the Four Characteristics of dharmas:
*   Suffering (*duḥkha*)
*   Emptiness (*śūnyatā*)
*   Impermanence (*anitya*)
*   Non-self (*anātman*)
*   No great, no small; no arising, no ceasing.
*   Everything is markless (*animitta*).
*   The nature and characteristics of dharmas are originally empty and tranquil.
*   No coming, no going; no exiting, no appearing.

Those who heard this attained the 'Warmth' stage, the 'Peak' stage, the 'Supreme Worldly' stage; the fruit of Stream-Entry (*Srotāpanna*), Once-Returner (*Sakṛdāgāmin*), Non-Returner (*Anāgāmin*), and Arhat (*Arhat*); the Way of the Pratyekabuddha; or engaged the Bodhi-mind (*Bodhicitta*) ascending from the first ground to the tenth ground.

What is the difference between the meaning of the dharmas preached in those past days and the dharma preached today? Why do you say that by cultivating the profound, supreme Great Vehicle *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra*, a Bodhisattva will 'certainly quickly attain supreme Bodhi'? How is this so? We only wish the World-Honored One would, out of compassion for all, distinguish this broadly for living beings, so that those hearing the Dharma in the present and future will have no remaining net of doubt."

## IV. The Buddha's River Metaphor

Thereupon, the Buddha told Great Adornment Bodhisattva: "Excellent, excellent! Great Good Man! You are able to ask the Tathāgata about this profound, supreme, subtle meaning of the Great Vehicle. You should know that you can bring much benefit and peace to humans and gods, pulling out the suffering of beings. This is true great kindness and compassion, faithful and not false. Because of this cause and condition, you will certainly quickly attain supreme Bodhi, and also cause all beings of the present and future to attain supreme Bodhi.

Good man! Since I sat beneath the Bodhi tree in the place of the Way (*bodhimaṇḍa*) and after six years attainable Supreme Perfect Enlightenment, I observed with the Buddha-eye that none of the dharmas could be declared [directly]. Why? Because the natures and desires of living beings are different.

*   Because natures and desires are different, I preached the Dharma in various ways.
*   Preaching in various ways, through the power of **skillful means** (*upāya*), for forty-some years I have **not yet revealed the Truth** (*wei ceng xian shi*).

Therefore, the way attained by living beings is differentiated, and they do not quickly attain supreme Bodhi.

Good man! The Dharma is like water: it can wash away grime and filth. Whether it is a well, a pond, a stream, a river, a canal, or a great ocean—all can wash away grime and filth. The water of the Dharma is also like this: it can wash away the grime of the afflictions (*kleśa*) of living beings.

Good man! The nature of water is one, but a river, stream, well, pond, canal, and ocean are each different.
The nature of the Dharma is also like this: washing away the dust of labor is no different, but the Three Laws (*Three Vehicles*), Four Fruits, and Two Ways are not one.

Good man! Although the water washes equally:
*   A well is not a pond.
*   A pond is not a river or stream.
*   A river or stream is not the ocean.

As the World Heo (*Lokajyeṣṭha*) is sovereign in the Dharma, the dharmas he preaches are also like this. The Initial, Middle, and Later preachings can all wash away the afflictions of living beings. However:
*   The Initial is not the Middle.
*   The Middle is not the Later.

The Initial, Middle, and Later preachings—though the expressions are the same, the meanings are different (*yi ge yi*).

## V. The Three Periods of Teaching

Good man! When I arose from the King of Trees and went to the Deer Park in Vārāṇasī, turning the Wheel of the Four Noble Truths for Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya and the five ascetics, I also said: 'All dharmas are originally empty and tranquil, continuously metabolizing (*daixie*) and not abiding, arising and perishing in every thought.'

In the middle period, at this place and various other places, debating and proclaiming the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination and the Six Perfections for the Bhikṣus and Bodhisattvas, I also said: 'All dharmas are originally empty and tranquil, continuously metabolizing and not abiding, arising and perishing in every thought.'

Now, arriving here to proclaim the Great Vehicle *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra*, I *also* say: 'All dharmas are originally empty and tranquil, continuously metabolizing and not abiding, arising and perishing in every thought.'

Good man! Therefore: **The Initial Preaching, the Middle Preaching, and the Present Preaching—the expressions are one, but the meanings differ.**

Because the meanings differ, the understanding of living beings differs.
Because the understanding differs, the Attainment of Dharma, the Attainment of Fruit, and the Attainment of the Way also differ.

*   **Initial Period:** I preached the Four Truths for those seeking to be **Śrāvakas**. Yet 800 million heavenly beings came down to listen and generated the Bodhi-mind.
*   **Middle Period:** I preached the Twelve Links for those seeking to be **Pratyekabuddhas**. Yet immeasurable beings generated the Bodhi-mind, or abided in the Śrāvaka stage.
*   **Later (Vaipulya) Period:** I preached the twelve divisions of scripture, the *Mahā-Prajñā*, and the *Avataṃsaka* Ocean-Cloud, explaining the Bodhisattva's practice through eons. Yet hundreds of thousands of monks and millions of humans and gods attained the fruits of [the Arhat] or abided in the Pratyekabuddha dharma.

Good man! By this meaning, know that *the preaching is the same, but the meaning varies*.
Thus, good man! Since I attained the Way, from the first preaching until today's *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra*, I have never *not* preached suffering, emptiness, impermanence, non-self; not real, not false; not great, not small; originally unborn, and now not extinguishing; all formless (*wuxiang*); the nature and characteristics of dharmas neither coming nor going. Yet living beings are moved by the four characteristics [or arising, abiding, changing, ceasing].

Good man! This is why the Buddhas have no double-speech. They can respond to all voices with a single sound. With one body, they show bodies as numerous as the sands of the Ganges... This is the inconceivable profound realm of the Buddhas, not known by the Two Vehicles, nor reachable by Bodhisattvas of the Ten Abodes. Only a Buddha and a Buddha can fathom it thoroughly.

Good man! Therefore I say: The subtle, profound, supreme Great Vehicle *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra* is structurally true and correct... If a Bodhisattva wants to quickly attain Supreme Bodhi, he should cultivate this Sutra."

## VI. The Miraculous Confirmation

When the Buddha finished speaking, the three-thousand great-thousand world system shook in six ways. Spontaneously, various heavenly flowers rained from the sky... [The text describes the rain of flowers, incense, robes, and offerings from the heavens].

Then, in the assembly, thirty-two thousand Bodhisattva-mahāsattvas attained the **Immeasurable Meanings Samādhi**.
Thirty-four thousand Bodhisattvas attained countless Dharani-doors and could turn the non-retrogressive Dharma wheel...
[The text lists the attainments of the various monks, nuns, laypeople, and heavenly beings: attaining the Four Fruits, the Non-Arising Dharma Patience, and various numbers of Dharanis.]

Immeasurable living beings generated the mind of Supreme Perfect Enlightenment.

## VII. Philosophical Commentary & Scholarly Apparatus

### Technical Terms & Philological Notes

1.  **Immeasurable Meanings (*Ananta-nirdeśa* / *Wúliángyì*)**: The central concept of this sutra. It signifies that from the single fundamental truth (Emptiness/One Mind), infinite specific teachings and meanings emerge. This justifies the diversity of Buddhist scriptures as adaptations of a single truth.
2.  **Not yet revealed the Truth (*wei ceng xian shi*)**: A critical phrase (Line 105) often cited by Nichiren and Tiantai scholars. It explicitly demarcates the *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra* (and implicitly the *Lotus Sutra* which follows) as the "Truth" (*shi*), relegating the previous 40 years of teaching to "Skillful Means" (*quán*).
3.  **Metabolizing (*daixie*)**: A biological or cyclical metaphor used here to describe the constant flux of mental and physical dharmas. It implies a 'replacement' or 'succession' rather than mere destruction.
4.  **One Law (*Yi Fa*)**: In Tiantai philosophy, this is identified as the **True Aspect** (*Shi Xiang*). It is the source from which all other meanings (provisional teachings) manifest.
5.  **Three Laws / Three Vehicles**: The Buddha explicitly states here that water (Dharma nature) is one, but the specific manifestations (well, pond, river) are different. This corresponds to the Three Vehicles (Śrāvaka, Pratyekabuddha, Bodhisattva) which are distinct provisional paths leading to the One Vehicle.

### Doctrinal Analysis (Tiantai Perspective)

This chapter is crucial for the Tiantai classification of the teachings (*panjiao*). It provides the scriptural evidence for the **"Opening the Provisional to Reveal the Real"**.

*   **The Paradox:** The Buddha admits he has used the *same words* (Empty, Tranquil, Non-Arising) for 40 years.
*   **The Resolution:** Although the *words* were the same, the *meaning* (*yi*) intended was different based on the audience's capacity.
    *   **Context A (Hīnayāna):** "Empty" meant specifically the absence of a permanent self (*ātman*).
    *   **Context B (Prajñā/Wisdom):** "Empty" meant the lack of intrinsic nature (*svabhāva*) in all phenomena.
    *   **Context C (Lotus/Immeasurable):** "Empty" refers to the *Dynamic Potentiality* of the One Mind to manifest infinite meanings.

This validates Zhiyi's "Five Periods" classification, placing this sutra at the very threshold of the Lotus Sutra period (the "Real").
