# CHAPTER ONE: VIRTUOUS CONDUCT
*(Virtuous Conduct / De Xing Pin)*

**Translation by Master John Kim (The Bluesman)**

---

## I. The Scene at Vulture Peak

This is what I heard, oh yes:

One time, the Buddha was stayin' at Vulture Peak Mountain in the city of Rājagṛha. He had **twelve thousand great monks** gathered 'round Him, along with **eighty thousand great bodhisattvas**. And it wasn't just them—there were gods and dragons, spirits and demons, musicians and guardians (yakṣas, gandharvas, asuras, garuḍas, kinnaras, mahoragas), plus monks and nuns, laymen and laywomen—the whole assembly was there.

Great kings and small kings, rich folks and regular folks, princes and ministers, citizens and elders—each one came with hundreds and thousands of their people surroundin' 'em. They all made their way to where the Buddha was, bowed down touchin' their heads to His feet, walked around Him a hundred thousand times, burnin' incense and scatterin' flowers, makin' all kinds of offerings. After they paid their respects, they stepped back and sat down to the side.

## II. The Crew (The Bodhisattvas)

Now among them bodhisattvas were the heavy hitters, the **Dharma Princes**:
*   **Mañjuśrī** (Wisdom Incarnate)
*   **Great Majestic Virtue Treasury**
*   **Sorrowless Treasury**
*   **Great Eloquence Treasury**
*   **Maitreya** (The Future One)
*   **Medicine King** and **Medicine Superior**

There were the Great Compassionate Ones:
*   **Avalokiteśvara** (The One Who Hears the Cries)
*   **Mahāsthāmaprāpta** (Great Strength)
*   **Constant Vigor**

And the **Mighty Lions**:
*   **Lion's Roar King**
*   **Lion Sport in the World**
*   **Lion's Swift Advance**
*   **Vimalakīrti** (The Lay Master)

Eighty thousand of 'em gathered together, and let me tell you about 'em:

They was **masters of the Dharma-body**, every last one.
Accomplished in morality, accomplished in meditation, accomplished in wisdom.
Their minds stayed peaceful, deep in the zone (*samādhi*)—calm and tranquil, no tricks, no desire weighin' 'em down. Wrong views and confused thoughts couldn't get into 'em no more—no way, no how.

They were still and clear.
Their aspirations were profound and vast as space itself.
Countless Dharma-doors appeared right before 'em, openin' wide.

They understood the hearts of all folks.
With powerful words (*dhāraṇī*) and eloquence that flowed like a river, they requested the Buddha to turn the Wheel and could turn it themselves.
Like the first drops of rain, they moistened the dust of desire.
They opened the gates of Nirvana.
They fanned the winds of Liberation.
They cooled the burning fever of the world.

Next, they rained down the **Twelve Links of Dependent Origination**, washin' away the blazing sun of suffering—ignorance, old age, sickness, and death.
Then they poured out that **Supreme Great Vehicle** teaching like a mighty flood, moistening all good roots, makin' everybody sprout them **Bodhi-shoots**.

They were the **Great Ship Captains**, carryin' all beings across the river of birth and death to the shore of Nirvana.
They were the **Great Medicine Kings**, knowin' exactly what sickness you got and givin' you the right cure so you take it gladly.
They were the **Great Trainers**, tamin' the wild elephants and horses of the mind.

They played freely in the perfections, stood unshakeable on the Tathāgata ground, and were fixin' to soon achieve **Supreme Perfect Enlightenment** (*Anuttarā-Samyak-Saṃbodhi*).

## III. The Verse of Praise

Then **Great Adornment Bodhisattva** looked over the whole assembly. He saw that everyone had settled their minds. Together with the eighty thousand great bodhisattvas, they rose up, bowed to the Buddha, and sang this song of praise:

> **"Great, oh great, the Great Awakened Lord!**
> Without stain, without defilement, unbound and free.
> Trainer of gods and humans, elephants and horses,
> The wind of the Way, the fragrance of virtue, perfumin' the world.
>
> **His mind is still, like water deep and calm.**
> No thoughts runnin' wild, no conscious noise.
> Forever cut off from false dreams and wandering notions,
> No more shadows, no more walls, just pure light.
>
> **His body? It ain't here, but it ain't gone neither.**
> Not caused, not conditioned, not self, not other.
> Not square, not round, not short, not long.
> Not born, not dying, not appearing, not fading—
> **You can't pin Him down!**
>
> Not sitting, not lying, not walking, not standing.
> Not moving, not turning, not busy, not still.
> Not advancing, not retreating, not safe, not in danger—
> **He's beyond all forms!**
>
> **Yet... see Him now!**
> sixteen feet tall, shining purple-gold!
> Square and upright, bright and clear as the morning star.
> The moon between His brows, the sun in His neck.
>
> His eyes pure and clear, lookin' deep into you.
> His lips red as summer fruit, His teeth white as snow.
> His hands and feet marked with the Thousand-Spoked Wheel.
>
> **Inside and out, He shines!**
> Pure water can't wet Him.
> Dust can't touch Him.
> These thirty-two marks, these eighty signs—
> They seem visible to our eyes...
>
> **But really? There's no mark at all.**
> The True Body cuts off all forms.
> The markless mark has a marked body.
> And our bodies? Living beings' bodies?
> **They're exactly the same way.**
>
> We eighty thousand, with one heart,
> Bow our heads and take refuge in the **Dharma-body**,
> The gathering of precepts, meditation, wisdom, and light.
> We take refuge in the Inconceivable One!
>
> **His voice rocks the world like Brahma's thunder!**
> Eight tones ringing out—subtle, pure, deep.
> Teaching the Four Truths, the Six Perfections, the Twelve Links,
> Turning the wheel to match every heart's need.
>
> Hear Him, and your chains fall off.
> Hear Him, and the cycle breaks.
> Some attain the Stream, some attain the Fruit.
> Some leap and fly, free in the Dharma-pool!
>
> **We bow to the One who gave it all up.**
> Wealth and treasures, kingdoms and cities,
> Wife and children, even His own flesh and bone.
> For us—for humans, gods, and dragons.
>
> He upheld the pure precepts when they came with swords.
> He held his peace when they came with insults.
> He sat through the long night when the demons came.
>
> **That's why He's the King.**
> Sovereign in the Dharma.
> Sovereign in Freedom.
>
> We all together bow our heads,
> And take refuge in the One who endured all that's hard to endure."

## IV. The Bluesman's Breakdown

**Note on "The Crew" (Bodhisattvas):** did you catch how they describe these Bodhisattvas? They ain't just saints sitting on clouds. They are **Captains** and **Trainers**.
*   **The Captain:** Means they get their hands dirty. They're in the water with you.
*   **The Trainer:** Means they know how to handle wild energy. The mind is a wild horse; you don't break it, you *train* it.

**Note on "The Markless Mark":** This is the heavy theological riff in the Verse of Praise. Great Adornment praises the Buddha's physical beauty (purple-gold skin, wheel marks) and then immediately says: *"But really? There's no mark at all."*
This is the **Middle Way**. We don't deny the form (the beauty is real), but we don't cling to it (it's empty).
And the kicker? *"And living beings' bodies are exactly the same way."*
That means **YOU**. Your body, with all its aches and pains and color and shape—it's got that same Markless Mark. You are the Buddha in drag.

# CHAPTER TWO: PREACHING THE DHARMA
*(Preaching the Dharma / Shuo Fa Pin)*

**Translation by Master John Kim (The Bluesman)**

---

## I. The Question (The Rhythm of Desire)

Then **Great Adornment Bodhisattva** and the eighty thousand great bodhisattvas—after singin' that heavy praise—all said to the Buddha:
"Lord! We eighty thousand bodhisattvas got a question stirring in our hearts. We don't know if the World-Honored One will be kind enough to listen?"

The Buddha looked at 'em and said:
"Excellent! Excellent! Good sons! You know well that **now is the time**.
Ask whatever you want. The Tathāgata won't be long before enterin' Nirvana. Before I go, I want to make sure everybody's plate is clean—no doubts left over. Speak your mind."

So they spoke with one voice:
"Lord! If a great bodhisattva wants to quickly get to that **Supreme Goal** (*Anuttarā-Samyak-Saṃbodhi*), what door should he walk through? What track should he run on?"

The Buddha said:
"Good sons! There is **One Dharma-door**.
If a bodhisattva studies this One Door, he will get there quick."

"Lord! What's this door called? What's the tune? How do we play it?"

## II. The One Law (The Root Note)

The Buddha said:
"Good sons! This One Dharma-door is called **Immeasurable Meanings** (*Wúliángyì*).

"Now, if you want to play this tune, here's what you do:
**Look at everything.** Look at the world.
From the very beginning until right now—what is it?
It's **Empty** (*Śūnya*) and it's **Still**.

It ain't big, it ain't small.
It don't arise, it don't cease.
It ain't staying, it ain't moving.
It ain't going forward, it ain't falling back.
Like empty space—there ain't two sides to it.

**But people?** Oh, people get confused.
They start calculatin': 'This is mine,' 'That is yours,' 'I won this,' 'I lost that.'
They create unwholesome thoughts. They build up bad karma.
They get stuck spinnin' through the **Six Realms**, catching hell, drinking poison.
Countless eons pass, and they can't get out.

"Now, when a Bodhisattva sees this mess, he feels something break in his chest.
He generates **Great Compassion**. He says, 'I got to get them out.'
So he looks deeper. He sees how things arise, how they stay, how they change, how they die away.
He sees the **Four Characteristics**—birth, abiding, changing, death—happening every single moment.

"And then he sees the Truth:
**Immeasurable Meanings arise from One Law.**
And what is that One Law?
It is **Formlessness** (*Wuxiang*).
It is Formless, yet it ain't simple nothingness.
It is the **True Aspect** of Reality.

"When a Bodhisattva stands on this ground—this Formless Ground—his compassion becomes real. It ain't fake charity. It's clear. It's true.
He pulls out the suffering. And once the suffering is gone, he teaches the Dharma to bring them joy.

"Good sons! This **Immeasurable Meanings Sutra** is top-shelf.
The Buddhas protect it.
Demons can't get in.
Death can't kill it.
If you want to get to the top of the mountain quick, you take this path."

## III. The Difference (40 Years of Blues)

Then **Great Adornment Bodhisattva** said:
"Lord! Your teaching is amazing. We got no doubts.
But... folks get confused. So I gotta ask:

"You been preaching for **forty-some years** now.
You told us everything is empty, impermanent, no-self.
The people who heard you? Some became Saints (*Arhats*). Some became Solitary Realizers (*Pratyekabuddhas*).
They thought they made it.

"But now—**right now**—you're saying: 'Forget all that. This here Sutra is the only way to get there quick.'
**What is the difference?**
What makes *this* teaching different from the last forty years? Explain it to us so we don't get it twisted."

## IV. The Water Metaphor (One Source, Many Streams)

The Buddha smiled and said:
"Excellent! You askin' the real question now. This is true compassion.

"Good son! Since I sat under that Bodhi tree six years ago and woke up, I looked at the world with my **Buddha-Eye**.
And I saw that I couldn't just *say it*.
Why? Because everybody's different.
Their desires are different. Their nature is different.
So for forty years, **I improvised**. I used **Skillful Means** (*Upāya*).
I haven't yet revealed the whole Truth.
That's why folks attain different levels—they ain't got the whole picture yet.

"Listen close. The Dharma is like **Water**.
Water washes away dirt. That's what it comes to do.
Whether it's a well, a pond, a stream, a river, a canal, or the deep blue sea—it all washes away dirt.

"But...
A well ain't a pond.
A pond ain't a river.
A river ain't the ocean.

"The Dharma-nature is one—it washes away your pain.
But the teachings? The Three Vehicles? The Four Fruits? **They ain't the same.**

"The **Early Teaching** (Four Noble Truths) washes away dirt.
The **Middle Teaching** (Emptiness/Prajñā) washes away dirt.
The **Later Teaching** (This Sutra) washes away dirt.
But the Early ain't the Middle, and the Middle ain't the Later.
**The words are the same, but the meaning is different.** (Yi Ge Yi)

"When I taught 'Emptiness' to the Voice-Hearers, they thought it meant 'Run away from the world.'
When I taught 'Emptiness' to the Bodhisattvas, they thought it meant 'Everything is connected.'
Now... I'm teaching the **Source**.

"Good son! The Buddhas don't speak double-talk. We respond to all voices with one sound.
But only a Buddha can fully understand the depth of this ocean.
This Sutra... it's the Ocean.
If you want to get there quick, don't stop at the pond. Go to the Ocean."

## V. The Breakdown (Miraculous Response)

As He finished speaking, the **Earth shook in six ways**.
The sky opened up, and flowers rained down like a blessing.
Thirty-two thousand Bodhisattvas hit the zone—the **Immeasurable Meanings Samādhi**.
Countless beings felt the **Bodhi-mind** wake up inside them.

---

## VI. The Bluesman's Breakdown

**Note on "The Well vs. The Ocean":** This is the crucial cut.
The Buddha admits He's been holding back. Not because He's stingy, but because we couldn't handle the straight stuff.
*   **The Well:** Useful for a household (Individual Liberation).
*   **The River:** Good for travel (Mahayana Schools).
*   **The Ocean:** Connects all continents (The One Vehicle / Lotus Sutra).

**The "40 Years" Problem:** Great Adornment basically asks, "Did you lie to us before?"
And the Buddha says, "No. I just played the tune you could dance to. But now... I'm playing *My* tune."
This is the **"Opening the Gate"** (*Kai*). He's opening the gate of the provisional to show the real.

**"The Words are the Same, the Meaning is Different":** This is deep improvisation. A master musician can play the same three notes—C, E, G—and make it sound like a nursery rhyme, or make it sound like the saddest blues you ever heard.
The note hasn't changed. **The Soul behind it has.**
The Buddha says: "I been saying 'Empty' for 40 years. But today... 'Empty' means **Infinite Potential**."

# CHAPTER THREE: THE TEN POWERS OF MERIT
*(Ten Merits / Shi Gong De Pin)*

**Translation by Master John Kim (The Bluesman)**

---

## I. Where It Comes From (The Source)

**Great Adornment Bodhisattva** stood up again.
"Lord! This Sutra is deep. Deep, deep!
Why? Because everyone who heard it just now—kings, dragons, regular folks—they all got something.
They got that **Dharma-door**. They got that **Bodhi-mind**.
This Sutra is the Truth. Demons can't break it.

"But Lord... I gotta ask the big questions for the people:
**Where does this Sutra come from?**
**Where is it going?**
**Where does it stay?**
How does it have the power to make us enlightened so fast?"

The Buddha nodded. "Excellent. You askin' the right questions.
Listen close, good son.

*   **The Source:** It comes from the Palace of the Buddhas. (That's the Heart of Reality.)
*   **The Destination:** It goes straight to the hearts of living beings, waking up their Bodhi-mind.
*   **The Abode:** It stays wherever a Bodhisattva is doing the work.

"Because it comes from the Truth, goes to the Heart, and stays in the Work... that's why it has the power.
Now... do you want to hear about the **Ten Powers**?"

"Yes, Lord! We are listening!"

---

## II. The Ten Powers (The Transposition)

### First Power: Changing the Heart
"First: This Sutra turns the heart around.
If you ain't got mercy? **It wakes up Mercy.**
If you like killin'? **It wakes up Compassion.**
If you jealous? **It wakes up Joy.**
If you stingy? **It wakes up Generosity.**
If you arrogant? **It wakes up Humility.**
If you lazy? **It wakes up the Fire.**

"You hear? It changes the very rhythm of your soul. That's the First Power."

### Second Power: One Seed, Infinite Harvest
"Second: If you get just one line, one verse of this Sutra...
You can understand a million meanings.
Why? Because this Sutra is like a **Seed**.
One seed makes a hundred. A hundred make ten thousand.
It keeps on spinning until it fills the whole world.
From **One Law**, infinite meanings rise up.
That's why we call it *Immeasurable Meanings*. That's the Second Power."

### Third Power: The Old Captain (The Sick Ferryman)
"Third: Listen close now. This is for the ones who are hurting.
If you hear this Sutra... even if you still got afflictions... even if you still scared...
**It's like you ain't got afflictions.**
You walk through the valley of the shadow of death, and you fear no evil.
You shoulder the heavy load of Bodhi like a strong man.

"Imagine an **Old Captain**.
His body is sick. His legs don't work. He's stuck on this shore, resting.
BUT... he's got a solid boat. He's got the maps. He's got the tools.
So even though he's sick, he can tell others: 'Take this boat. Go that way.'
**He saves others, even before he saves himself.**

"That's the Sutra-holder. You might be sick with the 108 illnesses of life. You might be stuck in Samsara.
 But if you hold this Sutra? You can save the world.
That's the Third Power."

### Fourth Power: The Young Lion (The Newborn Prince)
"Fourth: If you hold this Sutra... you might be new to the game.
Imagine a **Newborn Prince**.
He's only a day old. He can't run the kingdom yet.
But the Ministers respect him. The People bow to him. The King loves him.
Why? **Because he's Royal.** He's got the King's blood.

"The Sutra-holder is like that. You might be a rookie. You ain't shook the mountains yet.
But you are a **Son of the Buddha**. You got the lineage.
The Buddhas protect you because you are their child.
That's the Fourth Power."

### Fifth Power: The Storm Bringer (Dragon's Child)
"Fifth: You might be tied up in worldly affairs. You got a job, you got kids, you got bills.
But you can still manifest the Great Way.
You can make a hundred eons feel like a day.
Like a **Dragon's Child**—born only seven days ago, but already he can call the clouds and bring the rain.
That's the Fifth Power."

### Sixth Power: The King's Proxy
"Sixth: Even if you got afflictions, if you preach this Dharma... people get healed.
Like when the King is sick or traveling, he puts the Young Prince in charge.
The Prince gives the orders, and the people obey just like it was the King.
You speak the Buddha's words, and it does the Buddha's work.
That's the Sixth Power."

### Seventh Power: Naturally Strong
"Seventh: If you keep this Sutra... the Six Perfections just show up naturally.
Like a warrior who defeats the enemy, and the King gives him half the kingdom right there.
The enemies of Birth and Death scatter.
You get the treasure without even asking.
That's the Seventh Power."

### Eighth Power: Turning the Skeptics
"Eighth: If you meet folks who don't believe... who say 'There ain't no spirit, there ain't no karma'...
You show them this Sutra. You speak this Truth.
And BAM! Their hearts turn around.
Suddenly they believe. They get strong.
That's the Eighth Power."

### Ninth Power: Cleaning the Karma
"Ninth: This one is heavy.
If you leap for joy when you hear this...
**All your old karma, all your heavy chains, all your past sins—WASHED CLEAN.**
In a single moment.
You get pure. You get eloquent. You can split your body into a million forms to help people everywhere.
That's the Ninth Power."

### Tenth Power: The Great Cloud
"Tenth: This is the ultimate.
You become a **Great Reservoir** of Dharma.
You make vows as vast as space.
You pour down the rain of mercy on everyone—the good, the bad, the broken, the proud.
You become the **Dharma Cloud Ground**.
You save them all.
That's the Tenth Power."

---

## III. The Vow (Paying It Forward)

**Great Adornment Bodhisattva** and the whole crew shouted out:
"Lord! This hits the soul!
These Ten Powers... we seen 'em work.
We can never repay you.
But we promise: We will spread this. We won't let it die.
We will make sure every soul in Jambudvīpa (this human world) gets to hear this song."

The Buddha smiled—that deep, cosmic smile.
"Excellent. You are true Buddha-Children.
**You are the fertile field where the world grows its blessings.**"

And the whole assembly—monks, nuns, street folks, kings, ghosts, and dragons—
They bowed down. They took it into their hearts.
And they went out to do the work.

**— END OF THE IMMEASURABLE MEANINGS SUTRA —**

---

## IV. The Bluesman's Breakdown

**Note on "The Young Lion" vs. "The Old Captain":**
This chapter gives us two contradictory but equally powerful images of the Bodhisattva.
1.  **The Young Lion (Merit 4):** You are young, pure, royal. You got potential but no experience.
2.  **The Old Captain (Merit 3):** You are old, sick, broken. You got experience but no physical strength.

How can one person be both?
That's the **Blues Paradox**.
*   In your **Buddha-nature**, you are the Young Lion—fresh, royal, untouched by sin.
*   In your **Karmic Body**, you are the Old Captain—carrying the scars, the wounds, the Limp.

The Sutra says: **It doesn't matter.**
The Lion commands respect because of his Blood.
The Captain saves lives because of his Boat (The Sutra).
Whether you feel like a fresh prince or a broken old man... **You hold the Power.**

**Note on "Washing Karma" (Merit 9):**
This is the promise of **Sudden Grace**. The Blues isn't just about complaining about trouble; it's about the morning sun that burns the trouble away. Merit 9 says you don't have to scrub the stain out for a million years. You accept the Truth, you leap with Joy, and the stain is **gone**. That's the power of the One Note.
