## CHAPTER THREE: THE TEN POWERS OF MERIT

Then Great Adornment Bodhisattva said to the Buddha again: "World-Honored One! This subtle, profound, supreme Great Vehicle Immeasurable Meanings Sutra that the World-Honored One has taught is truly profound! Profound, profound! Why is that? Among this assembly—the great bodhisattvas and the fourfold assembly, gods, dragons, ghosts, spirits, kings, ministers, citizens, all beings—those who heard this profound supreme Great Vehicle Immeasurable Meanings Sutra all attained dhāraṇī-doors, the three Dharmas, the four fruits, and the bodhi-mind. You should know this sutra has true and correct principles and words, supremely honored with nothing above it. The Buddhas of the three times all protect it. No demons or heretical groups can enter it. It cannot be destroyed by any wrong views or birth-and-death.

"Why is that? Because hearing it once, you can uphold all Dharmas. If beings get to hear this sutra, that's a great benefit. Why is that? If they can practice it, they will certainly quickly achieve anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. Those beings who don't get to hear it—you should know they're losin' a great benefit. Through immeasurable, limitless, inconceivable, incalculable eons, they'll never achieve anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. Why is that? Because they don't know the straight great path of bodhi, they walk on dangerous trails and face many obstacles.

"World-Honored One! This sutra is inconceivable. We only wish the World-Honored One would compassionately explain broadly for the great assembly the profoundly inconceivable matters of this sutra. World-Honored One! Where does this sutra come from? Where does it go to? Where does it dwell? How does it have such immeasurable merit and inconceivable power, enabling beings to quickly achieve anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi?"

Then the World-Honored One told Great Adornment Bodhisattva: "Excellent! Excellent! Good son! Yes, yes, just as you say. Good son! I say this sutra is profound, profound! Truly profound! Why is that? Because it enables beings to quickly achieve anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. Hearing it once, you can uphold all Dharmas. It's of great benefit to all beings. It's the great straight path without obstacles.

"Good son! You ask where this sutra comes from, where it goes to, and where it dwells—listen well and carefully. Good son! This sutra originally comes from the palaces of the Buddhas. It goes to all beings arousing the bodhi-mind. It dwells in the places where bodhisattvas practice. Good son! This sutra comes like this, goes like this, and dwells like this. Therefore, this sutra has such immeasurable merit and inconceivable power, enabling beings to quickly achieve anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. Good son! Would you like to hear about the ten more inconceivable powers of merit of this sutra?"

Great Adornment said: "Yes, we'd be glad to hear it."

The Buddha said: "Good son! First, this sutra can make bodhisattvas who haven't aroused the mind arouse the bodhi-mind. Those without compassion? They give rise to compassionate minds. Those who like killin'? They give rise to great compassionate minds. Jealous folks give rise to minds of rejoicing; attached folks give rise to minds of lettin' go; the stingy and greedy give rise to minds of generosity. The arrogant give rise to minds of keeping precepts; the angry give rise to minds of patience; the lazy give rise to minds of vigor. The scattered give rise to minds of meditation; the foolish give rise to minds of wisdom. Those unable to save others give rise to minds of saving others. Those who do the ten evils give rise to minds of the ten virtues; those who enjoy conditioned things turn their minds toward the unconditioned. Those with retreating minds develop non-retreating minds; those with outflows give rise to minds without outflows; those with many afflictions give rise to minds of eliminating afflictions.

"You hear? This sutra turns hearts around—that's its first power. Good son! This is called the first merit of inconceivable power of this sutra.

"Good son! Second, the inconceivable power of merit of this sutra: If beings get this sutra, even if just one turning, one verse, or even one sentence, they can penetrate hundreds of thousands of billions of meanings, and through immeasurable countless eons, they won't be able to finish explainin' all they've received and upheld. Why is that? Because this Dharma has immeasurable meanings.

"Good son! This sutra is like one seed producing hundreds of thousands of millions—and in those hundreds of thousands of millions, each one again produces hundreds of thousands of millions. Expanding like this until immeasurable. This sutra is also like this—from one Dharma arise hundreds of thousands of meanings; in those hundreds of thousands of meanings, each one again produces hundreds of thousands of millions. Expanding like this until immeasurable, limitless meanings. Therefore, this sutra is called Immeasurable Meanings. Good son! This is called the second merit of inconceivable power of this sutra.

"Good son! Third, the inconceivable power of merit of this sutra: If beings hear this sutra, even if just one turning, one verse, or even one sentence, and penetrate hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of meanings, though they have afflictions, it's like having no afflictions. Going out of birth and entering death, they have no thoughts of fear. For all beings, they give rise to compassionate minds. For all Dharmas, they gain the thought of courage and strength. Like a strong man who can carry and hold heavy things, those who uphold this sutra are also like this—able to shoulder the heavy treasure of supreme bodhi, bearing living beings out of the path of birth and death. Though unable to save themselves, they're already able to save others.

"It's like a ship captain whose body is afflicted with serious illness, whose four limbs don't work, restin' on this shore, but he has a good, solid boat always prepared with everything needed to ferry others across, and he gives it to them and lets them go. Those who uphold this sutra are also like this—though afflicted with the body of the five paths of existence, constantly entangled by the 108 serious illnesses, restin' on this shore of ignorance, old age, and death, they have this solid Great Vehicle sutra of Immeasurable Meanings, prepared to ferry beings across. Those who can practice as taught will cross over birth and death. Good son! This is called the third merit of inconceivable power of this sutra.

"Good son! Fourth, the inconceivable power of merit of this sutra: If beings hear this sutra, even just one turning, one verse, one sentence, they gain the thought of courage and strength. Though not yet saving themselves, they're able to save others and are accompanied by great bodhisattvas. The Buddhas always teach the Dharma to such people, and they receive it all, followin' without resistance.

"Good son! Such a person is like a newborn prince—whether one day old or seven years old, though he can't yet govern the kingdom, he's already honored by all the ministers and people. The other great princes are his companions. The king and queen especially love him and constantly talk with him. Why? Because he's still young, you see?

"Good son! Those who uphold this sutra are the same way. Though they can't yet shake the three-thousand great thousandfold world with the Dharma-wheel, they're already honored by the fourfold assembly. The great bodhisattvas are their companions. The Buddhas protect and love them—because they're new learners. Good son! This is called the fourth merit of inconceivable power of this sutra.

"Good son! Fifth, the inconceivable power of merit of this sutra: If good sons and good daughters, whether when the Buddha is in the world or after His passing, receive, uphold, read, recite, and copy this profound supreme Great Vehicle Immeasurable Meanings Sutra, such people, though still fully bound by afflictions and unable to distance themselves from ordinary worldly matters, are able to manifest the great bodhi path. They can extend one day to be a hundred eons, and they can also compress a hundred eons into one day, makin' living beings joyfully believe and submit. Good son! Such good sons and good daughters are like a dragon's child—just seven days after birth, it can already raise clouds and also bring down rain. Good son! This is called the fifth merit of inconceivable power of this sutra.

"Good son! Sixth, the inconceivable power of merit of this sutra: If good sons and good daughters receive and uphold this sutra, though they have afflictions, they teach the Dharma to beings, enabling them to leave behind afflictions and birth-and-death, cutting off all suffering. After beings hear it and practice, they attain Dharma, attain fruits, attain the Way, equal to the Buddha Tathāgata without difference.

"It's like a prince who, though still young, when the king goes on tour or is sick, is entrusted to govern the kingdom. The prince follows the great king's command, gives teachings to all the ministers according to the Dharma, spreadin' correct influence. The people of the land each rest in peace, just like when the great king governs—without any difference. Good sons and good daughters who uphold the sutra are the same way. Though they haven't yet attained the first immovable ground, relying on the Buddha's teaching, they explain it true. Beings hear it, practice with one mind, cut off afflictions, and attain the Way. Good son! This is called the sixth merit of inconceivable power of this sutra.

"Good son! Seventh, the inconceivable power of merit of this sutra: If good sons and good daughters hear this sutra, rejoice, believe, delight in it, give rise to a rare mind, receive, uphold, read, recite, copy, explain it, practice it according to the Dharma, arouse the bodhi-mind, give rise to all good roots, raise up great compassionate intention—wanting to save all suffering beings—listen now! Though they haven't yet practiced the Six Perfections, the Six Perfections naturally appear before them. Right in this body they attain patient acceptance of the non-arising of phenomena. Birth-and-death and afflictions are simultaneously destroyed, and they immediately ascend to the seventh ground and receive the rank of great bodhisattva!

"It's like a warrior eliminatin' enemies for the king. After the enemies are destroyed, the king is greatly pleased and rewards him with half the kingdom's territory, completely givin' it to him. Men and women who uphold the sutra are the same—among all practitioners, they're the most courageous and strong! The treasure of the six perfections Dharmas comes without seeking. The enemies of birth and death naturally scatter and are destroyed. They realize patient acceptance of non-arising and are rewarded with half the Buddha's kingdom's treasure in peace and joy. Good son! This is called the seventh merit of inconceivable power of this sutra.

"Good son! Eighth, the inconceivable power of merit of this sutra: If good sons and good daughters get this sutra, respect and believe in it as if viewing the Buddha's body itself, love and delight in this sutra, receive, uphold, read, recite, copy, carry it on their heads, practice it according to the Dharma, firmly keep precepts and patience, practice the perfection of giving, deeply send forth compassion, and broadly explain this supreme Great Vehicle Immeasurable Meanings Sutra to others—if there's someone who previously didn't believe in sin and blessings at all, show them this sutra, set up various skillful means, and strongly transform them to make them believe. Through the awesome power of the sutra, their minds are suddenly turned around! Once the believing mind arises, they courageously advance with vigor. Through the power of this sutra's majestic virtue, they attain the Way and attain fruits.

"Therefore, good sons and good daughters, right in this body, attain patient acceptance of the non-arising of phenomena, reach the upper ground, are accompanied by all bodhisattvas, quickly accomplish purifying Buddha-lands and achieving beings, and soon attain supreme bodhi. Good son! This is called the eighth merit of inconceivable power of this sutra.

"Good son! Ninth, the inconceivable power of merit of this sutra—and this one's powerful now, you hear? If good sons and good daughters get this sutra, rejoice and leap with joy, experiencing what they've never had before, receive, uphold, read, recite, copy, make offerings, broadly explain and interpret the meaning of this sutra for many people—their remaining karma, leftover sins, and heavy obstacles all extinguished at once! Then they attain purity, gain great eloquence, adorn in sequence all the perfections, obtain all the samādhis and the heroic samādhi, enter the great dhāraṇī door, gain diligent vigor power, quickly transcend the upper grounds. They skillfully divide their bodies and scatter themselves throughout the ten directions, pulling out and saving all beings in the twenty-five states of existence who experience extreme suffering, enabling them all to gain liberation! Therefore, this sutra has such power. Good son! This is called the ninth merit of inconceivable power of this sutra.

"Good son! Tenth—and now we come to the final power, the culmination of all these merits—the inconceivable power of merit of this sutra: If good sons and good daughters get this sutra and give rise to great joy, give rise to a rare mind, themselves receive, uphold, read, recite, copy, make offerings, practice as taught, and also broadly encourage both householders and those who've left home to receive, uphold, read, recite, copy, make offerings, explain, and practice according to the Dharma—thereby causing others to practice—through the power of this sutra, they attain the Way and attain fruits, all due to the power of that good son's or good daughter's compassionate mind diligently transforming them.

"Now listen to what happens to such good sons and good daughters, you hear? Right in this body, they immediately attain immeasurable dhāraṇī doors. On the ground of ordinary beings, naturally from the very beginning, they're able to send forth countless incalculable great vows of vast scope. They're deeply able to send forth the saving of all living beings, accomplish great compassion, broadly able to rescue suffering. They thickly gather good roots, benefit everyone, pour forth the moisture of Dharma, abundantly moistening the parched and dried up. They refine all living beings with the medicine of many Dharmas, bring peace and joy to everyone, gradually see them ascend and climb, dwell on the Dharma Cloud ground. They spread kindness's moisture universally, compassion covering without limit, gathering up suffering beings, causing them to enter the path.

"Therefore, such a person will soon achieve anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi! Good son! This is called the tenth merit of inconceivable power of this sutra.

"Good son! This supreme Great Vehicle Immeasurable Meanings Sutra has extremely great mighty spiritual power, supremely honored with nothing above it. It can enable all ordinary beings to all achieve sagehood fruits, forever leaving birth and death and gaining freedom. Therefore, this sutra is called Immeasurable Meanings. It can enable all living beings on the ground of ordinary beings to give rise to the immeasurable path-sprouts of bodhisattvas, causing the tree of merit to flourish, spread out abundantly, and grow. Therefore, this sutra is called the Ten Powers of Inconceivable Merit."

Then Great Adornment Bodhisattva and the eighty thousand great bodhisattvas all said to the Buddha together with one voice: "World-Honored One! This teaching has shaken our very souls! These ten powers of inconceivable merit—we've witnessed 'em with our own eyes, seen this whole assembly transformed before us. Your compassion in revealing this profound Dharma has given us a gift we can never repay. We're filled with joy, yes we are! Filled with gratitude beyond measure!"

Then the three-thousand great thousandfold world shook in six ways once more, you hear? The heavens opened again—flowers rainin' down from every direction, incense and robes, jewels and necklaces, bowls overflowin' with flavors, music playin' sweet and clear. Just seein' the colors and smellin' the fragrance naturally satisfied everyone, fillin' their souls.

And again it shook in six ways throughout all ten directions. Buddha-worlds as numerous as Ganges sands made the same heavenly offerings, all singin' praise, all rejoicin'.

Then the Buddha told Great Adornment Bodhisattva and the eighty thousand great bodhisattvas: "Y'all should give rise to deep respect for this sutra, practice it according to the Dharma, broadly transform everyone, diligently spread it, always be earnest day and night in protectin' it, universally enabling all beings to each obtain Dharma benefit. Y'all truly have great loving-kindness and great compassion. Establish your spiritual powers and vow-power to protect this sutra, don't let there be doubts and hesitation. In the future age, you must make it spread widely throughout Jambudvīpa, enabling all living beings to be able to see, hear, read, recite, copy, and make offerings. Because of this, y'all will also quickly attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi."

At that time, Great Adornment Bodhisattva and the eighty thousand great bodhisattvas immediately rose from their seats, approached the Buddha, bowed with their heads at His feet, circled Him a hundred thousand times, then knelt before Him, all together with one voice, and said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! We're so blessed to receive the World-Honored One's compassion in explainin' this profound, subtle, supreme Great Vehicle Immeasurable Meanings Sutra for us. We respectfully receive the Buddha's instruction. After the Tathāgata's passing, we will broadly cause this sutra to spread, universally enabling everyone to receive, uphold, read, recite, copy, and make offerings. We only wish the World-Honored One wouldn't worry. We will, through our vow-power, universally enable all living beings to be able to see, hear, read, recite, copy, make offerings, and obtain the mighty spiritual power of this sutra's Dharma."

Then the Buddha praised them, sayin': "Excellent! Excellent! Good sons! Y'all now are truly Buddha's children, with great loving-kindness and great compassion, deeply able to pull out suffering and rescue from distress. Y'all are the good fertile field of blessings for all living beings, broadly serving as great good guides for everyone, the great dwelling place for all living beings, the great benefactors for all living beings, constantly broadly giving Dharma benefit to everyone."

Then the whole great assembly was filled with great joy. They bowed to the Buddha, received and upheld the teaching, and departed.
