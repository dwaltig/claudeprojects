## CHAPTER TWO: PREACHING THE DHARMA

Then Great Adornment Bodhisattva and the eighty thousand great bodhisattvas, after speakin' this verse praisin' the Buddha, all said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! We eighty thousand bodhisattvas now want to ask somethin' within the Tathāgata's Dharma. We don't know if the World-Honored One will be kind enough to listen or not?"

The Buddha told Great Adornment Bodhisattva and the eighty thousand bodhisattvas: "Excellent! Excellent! Good sons! You know well that now is the time—ask whatever you want. The Tathāgata won't be long before enterin' nirvana. After nirvana, I want to make sure everybody's got no more doubts. Whatever you want to ask, go ahead and speak."

Then Great Adornment Bodhisattva and the eighty thousand bodhisattvas, all speakin' together with one voice, said to the Buddha: "World-Honored One! If a great bodhisattva wants to quickly achieve anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, what Dharma-door should he practice? What Dharma-door can enable a great bodhisattva to quickly achieve anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi?"

The Buddha told Great Adornment Bodhisattva and the eighty thousand bodhisattvas: "Good sons! There's one Dharma-door that can enable bodhisattvas to quickly attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. If there's a bodhisattva who studies this Dharma-door, then he can quickly attain anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi."

"World-Honored One! What's this Dharma-door called? What does it mean? How should a bodhisattva practice it?"

The Buddha said: "Good sons! This one Dharma-door—it's called Immeasurable Meanings. Now if a bodhisattva wants to study Immeasurable Meanings, here's what he should do: contemplate all phenomena. From the very beginning until right now, their nature and characteristics been empty and still. They ain't great, they ain't small. They don't arise, they don't cease. They don't abide, they don't move. They ain't advancin', they ain't retreatin'. Like empty space—there ain't two natures to it. But living beings, through their confused thinkin', they say 'this is this' and 'that is that,' 'this here's gain' and 'that there's loss.' They give rise to unwholesome thoughts, create all kinds of evil karma, and cycle through the six realms, experiencin' all kinds of sufferin' and poison. Through immeasurable billions of eons, they can't get themselves out.

"When a great bodhisattva contemplates truly like this, he gives rise to a mind of compassion, sends forth great loving-kindness and great compassion, and wants to rescue beings. He also deeply enters all phenomena—how they arise, how they abide, how they change, how they cease. How they birth evil, how they birth good. Abiding, changing, and ceasing all follow the same pattern.

"When a bodhisattva contemplates the four characteristics from beginning to end and fully knows them all, then he truthfully contemplates all phenomena—moment by moment, not abiding, newly arising and ceasing each instant. He also contemplates arising, abiding, changing, and ceasing in the very same moment. After contemplatin' like this, he enters into the capacities and desires of living beings. Because the desires are immeasurable, the Dharma he teaches is immeasurable. Because the Dharma taught is immeasurable, the meanings are also immeasurable. Immeasurable meanings arise from one Dharma. That one Dharma is formlessness itself. This formlessness—formless yet not-form, not-form yet formless—is called true characteristic. When a great bodhisattva dwells securely in this true characteristic, the compassion he sends forth is clear and true, not false. For living beings, he can truly pull out their suffering. Once the suffering is pulled out, he then teaches them the Dharma, enabling all living beings to receive happiness and joy.

"Good sons! If a bodhisattva can practice this one Dharma-door of Immeasurable Meanings like this, he will certainly quickly achieve anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. Good sons! This profound supreme Great Vehicle Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings has true and correct principles and words, supremely honored with nothing above it. The Buddhas of the three times all protect it together. No demons or heretical paths can enter it. It cannot be destroyed by any wrong views or birth-and-death. Therefore, good sons! If a great bodhisattva wants to quickly achieve supreme bodhi, he should study this profound supreme Great Vehicle Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings."

Then Great Adornment Bodhisattva said to the Buddha again: "World-Honored One! The Dharma You teach is inconceivable, the capacities of living beings are also inconceivable, and the liberation of Dharma-doors is also inconceivable. We have no more doubts about the Dharma You've taught, but living beings might get confused minds, so we're askin' again.

"Lord! Ever since the Tathāgata attained the Way, for over forty years now, You've constantly been teaching living beings about the four characteristics—about suffering, emptiness, impermanence and no-self, nothing great, nothing small, no arising, no ceasing, everything formless, Dharma-nature and Dharma-characteristics originally empty and still, not coming, not going, not emerging, not disappearing. Those who heard attained the heat Dharma, the peak Dharma, the supreme worldly Dharma; stream-entry fruit, once-returning fruit, non-returning fruit, arhat fruit; the way of the solitary Buddha; arousing the bodhi-mind; climbing the first ground, second, third, all the way to the tenth ground.

"What You taught in the past—how is that different from what You're teachin' today? Yet You say that this profound supreme Great Vehicle Immeasurable Meanings Sutra, when practiced by bodhisattvas, will definitely enable them to quickly achieve supreme bodhi. How can this be? We only wish You would have compassion for everyone and explain this in detail for living beings, so that those who hear the Dharma now and in the future will have no remaining doubts."

Then the Buddha told Great Adornment Bodhisattva: "Excellent! Excellent! Great good son! You can ask the Tathāgata about such profound supreme Great Vehicle subtle meanings. You should know that you're able to greatly benefit and bring peace and joy to gods and humans, pullin' suffering beings out of their misery. This is true great compassion, sincere and not false. Because of these causes and conditions, you will certainly quickly achieve supreme bodhi, and you'll also enable all beings, now and in the future, to achieve supreme bodhi.

"Good son! Ever since I sat under the bodhi tree at the site of enlightenment for six years and achieved anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi, with the Buddha-eye I contemplated all phenomena and found they couldn't be spoken. Why is that? Because the natures and desires of living beings aren't the same. Because their natures and desires aren't the same, I teach the Dharma in various ways. Teaching the Dharma in various ways, using skillful means, for over forty years I haven't yet revealed the truth. Therefore, living beings attain the Way differently and don't quickly achieve supreme bodhi.

"Good son! The Dharma is like water—whether it's a well, pond, river, stream, canal, or the great ocean, they all wash away dirt and filth. That Dharma-water washes away the dirt of all living beings' afflictions.

"Good son! Water's nature is one, but the vessels are different. The Dharma-nature is also like this—washin' away the toil of the dust equally without difference, but the three Dharmas, four fruits, and two paths aren't the same.

"Good son! Although water washes the same way, a well ain't a pond, a pond ain't a river, and streams and canals ain't the ocean. Yet the Tathāgata, the World-Hero, is sovereign in the Dharma, and the Dharma He teaches is also like this. The early teaching, the middle teaching, and the later teaching all can wash away living beings' afflictions. But the early ain't the middle, and the middle ain't the later. The early, middle, and later teachings—though the words may be the same, the meanings are different.

"Good son! When I rose from beneath the Tree King and went to Deer Park at Bārāṇasī, I turned the Dharma-wheel of the Four Noble Truths for Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya and his five companions. At that time, I also taught that all phenomena have been originally empty and still, constantly changing, arising and ceasing moment by moment. Then in between, here and there, for monks and many bodhisattvas, I clearly explained and taught the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination and the Six Perfections—I also taught that all phenomena are originally empty and still, constantly changing, arising and ceasing moment by moment. Now again, here, I'm teachin' the Great Vehicle Immeasurable Meanings Sutra, and I'm also teaching that all phenomena are originally empty and still, constantly changing, arising and ceasing moment by moment.

"Good son! Therefore, the early teaching, the middle teaching, and the present teaching—the words are the same, but the meanings are different. Because the meanings are different, living beings' understanding is different. Because understanding is different, the Dharma they attain, the fruits they attain, and the Way they attain are also different.

"Good son! When I first taught the Four Truths for those seeking to be voice-hearers, eight hundred million gods came down to listen to the Dharma and aroused the bodhi-mind. In the middle, everywhere I deeply taught the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination for those seeking to be solitary Buddhas, and immeasurable beings aroused the bodhi-mind, or dwelt in the voice-hearer stage. Next, I taught the twelve divisions of the Vaipulya scriptures, the Mahāprajñāpāramitā, and the Avataṃsaka Ocean Cloud, explaining how bodhisattvas cultivate through the eons. Yet hundreds of thousands of monks, millions and billions of gods and humans, and immeasurable beings attained stream-entry, once-returning, non-returning, arhatship, or dwelt in the causes and conditions of the solitary Buddha Dharma.

"Good son! For this reason, you know that though the teaching is the same, the meanings are different. Because the meanings are different, living beings' understanding is different. Because understanding is different, the Dharma, fruits, and Way they attain are also different. Therefore, good son! Ever since I attained the Way and first began teaching the Dharma, right up till today teaching the Great Vehicle Immeasurable Meanings Sutra, I ain't never not taught about suffering, emptiness, impermanence, and no-self, not true, not false, not great, not small, originally not aflame, now also not extinguished, everything formless, Dharma-characteristics and Dharma-nature not coming and not going—yet living beings are moved by the four characteristics.

"Good son! For this reason, the Buddhas don't have two words. They can respond to all voices with one sound. They can manifest hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of nayutas, immeasurable, countless Ganges sands of bodies with one body. In each body, they again manifest so many hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of nayutas, incalculable, Ganges sands of various forms. In each form, they again manifest so many hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of nayutas, incalculable, Ganges sands of forms. Good son! This here is the Buddhas' inconceivable profound realm, you hear? Them two vehicles can't know it, and the bodhisattvas of the ten stages can't reach it neither. Only Buddha and Buddha can fully fathom it.

"Good son! Therefore, I say this subtle, profound, supreme Great Vehicle Immeasurable Meanings Sutra has true and correct principles and words, supremely honored with nothing above it. The Buddhas of the three times all protect it together. No demons or outside paths can enter it. It cannot be destroyed by any wrong views or birth-and-death. If a great bodhisattva wants to quickly achieve supreme bodhi, he should study this profound supreme Great Vehicle Immeasurable Meanings Sutra."

When the Buddha finished speakin' these words, right then the whole three-thousand great thousandfold world shook in six ways. And don't you know the sky opened up—all them heavenly flowers rainin' down, blue lotus and red, white and great white, heavenly incense and robes and jewels spinnin' down, offerings for the Buddha and all them bodhisattvas and voice-hearers and the whole great assembly. Heavenly kitchens and heavenly bowls overflowed with a hundred flavors—just seein' the colors and smellin' the fragrance made you naturally satisfied. Heavenly banners and flags, canopies and wonderful musical instruments were placed everywhere, and heavenly music was played, singin' praise of the Buddha.

And again it shook in six ways—in the eastern direction and throughout all ten directions, Buddha-worlds as numerous as Ganges sands rained down the same heavenly offerings, making music and singin' praise of the Buddha, the bodhisattvas, voice-hearers, and the great assembly.

Then among the assembly, thirty-two thousand great bodhisattvas attained the samādhi of Immeasurable Meanings. Thirty-four thousand great bodhisattvas attained countless immeasurable dhāraṇī-doors and were able to turn the irreversible Dharma-wheel of all Buddhas of the three times.

Among all those monks and nuns, laymen and laywomen, gods and dragons, kings and ministers, citizens and elders—hundreds and thousands gathered together—when they heard the Buddha teach this sutra, realizations bloomed like flowers after rain.

Some attained the heat Dharma, the peak Dharma, the supreme worldly Dharma. Some attained stream-entry fruit, once-returning fruit, non-returning fruit, arhat fruit, solitary Buddha fruit. Others attained the bodhisattva's patient acceptance of the non-arising of phenomena.

And the dhāraṇīs! Some attained one dhāraṇī, some two, some three, four, five—all the way to ten dhāraṇīs. Some attained hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of dhāraṇīs. Some attained immeasurable, countless, Ganges sands, incalculable dhāraṇīs!

They were all able to turn the irreversible Dharma-wheel accordingly. Immeasurable beings aroused the mind of anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi.
