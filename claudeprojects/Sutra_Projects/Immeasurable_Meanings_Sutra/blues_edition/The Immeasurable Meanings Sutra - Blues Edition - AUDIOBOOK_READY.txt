INTRODUCTION

Introduction to The Immeasurable Meanings Sutra: A Blues Interpretation

A Meeting of Two Sacred Traditions

You hold in your hands an unusual book—one that brings together two profound spiritual traditions separated by thousands of miles and centuries, yet united in their understanding of suffering, compassion, and liberation.

The Immeasurable Meanings Sutra (Woo-lee-ang Yee Jing) serves as the introduction to the Lotus Sutra, one of the most influential scriptures in East Asian Buddhism. Composed in Sanskrit or Chinese between the 3rd and 5th centuries CE, it presents the Buddha's teaching that from a single formless principle arise countless meanings and methods for liberating beings from suffering. The text you're about to read renders this ancient wisdom in the voice of the African American blues and gospel traditions—two streams of spiritual expression born from the crucible of suffering and forged into instruments of hope, resilience, and transcendence.

Why Blues?

This interpretation choice is deliberate and substantive. The blues tradition and Buddhist Dar-muh share profound spiritual kinship. Both arose from suffering—the Buddha teaching in the midst of sickness, old age, and death; the blues emerging from the legacy of slavery, oppression, and struggle in the American South. Both traditions transformed suffering not by denying it, but by looking it straight in the eye and finding within it the seeds of liberation.

The blues tells the truth about life's hardships while simultaneously testifying to the human capacity for endurance, joy, and spiritual freedom. Similarly, the Buddha's First Noble Truth doesn't flinch from acknowledging that life contains suffering (dook-kuh), while the remaining truths chart a path through and beyond it. Both traditions know that Sunday morning's resurrection requires Friday's crucifixion, that reaching neer-vah-nuh requires acknowledging sum-sah-ruh.

African American worship's call-and-response patterns, gospel music's repetitive incantatory phrases, and blues lyrics' direct emotional honesty parallel Buddhist sutra structure: ritualized repetitions, responsive dialogue between the Buddha and his disciples, and unflinching examination of the human condition.

The Source Text

The Immeasurable Meanings Sutra occupies a unique place in Buddhist literature. Recited traditionally before the Lotus Sutra, it serves as both an independent teaching and a gateway to the fuller revelation that follows. The text describes how the Buddha, after forty years of teaching doctrines suited to different capacities, reveals that all these teachings arise from a single formless reality, producing "immeasurable meanings."

The sutra is structured in three chapters:

Chapter One: Virtuous Conduct describes the assembly of bo-dee-sut-vuhs gathered at Vulture Peak Mountain and presents an elaborate praise-verse describing the Buddha's qualities and the path to enlightenment.

Chapter Two: Preaching the Dar-muh reveals the Buddha's core teaching on the Dar-muh-door of Immeasurable Meanings—how contemplating the empty, formless nature of all phenomena gives rise to great compassion and the ability to teach countless beings through countless methods.

Chapter Three: The Ten Powers of Merit enumerates ten extraordinary spiritual benefits that practitioners gain from hearing, upholding, and teaching this sutra, using vivid metaphors of dragon's children, ship captains, and royal princes.

The interpretation also includes a preface by Lee-oo Chee-oo (Shee-ow Chee dynasty, 479-502 CE) situating the text within the larger framework of Buddhist teaching and discussing the classical debate between gradual and sudden enlightenment.

How to Read This Interpretation

This interpretation preserves the structure, doctrinal content, and ceremonial character of the traditional sutra while rendering it in African American vernacular English:

Intentional non-standard grammar: "ain't," "they was," "them bo-dee-sut-vuhs"—these are not errors but authentic features of blues/gospel speech that carry their own dignity and expressive power.

Blues markers: Phrases like "you hear?", "you dig?", "yes indeed!", and "don't you know" function as the oral tradition's equivalent of punctuation, inviting the reader/listener into participatory engagement with the text.

Liturgical repetition: Like traditional sutras, this text contains extensive catalogs, repetitive formulae, and ceremonial language. These serve ritual purposes and create a meditative, incantatory rhythm suitable for recitation.

Sanskrit terms: The translation preserves names and technical terms like Shah-ree-poo-truh, Mun-joo-shree, Ah-vuh-lo-kee-tesh-vah-ruh, and ah-noo-tah-rah-sum-yuck-sum-bo-dee in their proper scholarly form to maintain connection with the broader Buddhist tradition.

Metaphors and imagery: The text blends traditional Buddhist images (water washing away defilements, seeds producing innumerable plants) with the metaphorical language of blues and gospel (storms, rivers, burdens, freedom, home).

A Note on Sacred Translation

Translation is always interpretation, especially when rendering sacred texts across cultural boundaries. Every choice—every word, rhythm, and turn of phrase—represents a decision about how to honor the source while making it alive for a new audience. This translation honors the Buddhist tradition by taking seriously the sutra's central claim: that the Dar-muh, like water, takes the shape of its container while remaining essentially unchanged. If the Dar-muh can be taught through the Four Noble Truths, the Twelve Links, the Six Perfections, and countless other formulations, why not through the spirituals, work songs, and gospel shouts that sustained generations on their journey from suffering to freedom?

This translation doesn't replace traditional renderings but stands alongside them—one more voice in the choir, one more method suited to particular hearts and minds. Some readers may find in these pages an unexpected gateway to Buddhist wisdom. Others already familiar with the Dar-muh may discover fresh resonance in hearing ancient truths spoken in this different register.

An Invitation

Whether you approach this text as a Buddhist practitioner, a lover of the blues tradition, a scholar of religious literature, or simply a curious reader, you are invited into an experiment in spiritual translation. Let yourself hear the Buddha's voice in this new key. Notice where the blues vernacular makes the teaching more immediate, more visceral, more alive. Notice where traditional scriptural language and contemporary American speech create unexpected harmonies.

Above all, remember: sutras call for practice, not mere reading. The text itself promises that those who receive, uphold, read, recite, and teach this sutra will gain immeasurable spiritual benefits through sincere engagement with the reality to which the words point—not through the words alone.

As the preface tells us, the Buddha taught different people according to their needs. This blues translation offers one more way, one more voice, one more Dar-muh-door through which beings might enter the path of liberation.

So go ahead now. Turn the page. Let the teaching begin.

May all beings attain the Way.

THE IMMEASURABLE MEANINGS SUTRA
(Blues Edition)

[Lee-oo Chee-oo] PREFACE TO THE IMMEASURABLE MEANINGS SUTRA

Written by Lee-oo Chee-oo, that lonesome hermit from Jing-joe, back in the Shee-ow Chee days

Now this here Immeasurable Meanings Sutra, it takes that One Formless Law and spreads it wide like gospel, birthin' all kinds of teachings, holdin' meanings you can't even count—that's why we call it "Immeasurable," you dig?

See, all them creatures in the three realms, they just keep on spinnin' 'round and 'round, followin' their karma like a old blues refrain. But that One Perfect Awakened One, He moves with the flow, respondin' to every soul that calls. Now them beings caught up in the wheel of birth and death, they're sufferin' somethin' terrible, hopin' for some joy—that's them knockin' on Heaven's door, that's their prayer, their cry. And when the Enlightened One shows up with His compassion and kindness, well, that's the answer to all them prayers, that's salvation comin' down the line.

Different folks got different needs, so the teachings come in seven stages, like seven verses of the cosmic blues:

First, He laid down the Five Precepts for folks like Bali and them—that's your basic human goodness, gettin' your soul right, stage one.

Second, He turned the wheel on the Four Noble Truths for Kaundinya and his crew—that's the Teaching for the Voice Hearers, stage two.

Third, He broke down them Twelve Links of Dependent Origination for them middle-grade souls—that's the Path for the Solitary Realizers, stage three.

Fourth, He raised up the Six Perfections for them sharp ones—that's the Great Vehicle, the real deal, stage four.

Now once all them teachings had been preached and the questions were piling up, He came out with this Immeasurable Meanings Sutra—stage five. It talks about how folks get enlightened in different ways, but ain't yet revealed the whole truth, makin' folks hungry for the real thing, openin' the door to that Ultimate One.

Then the Lotus Sutra picks up the tune—stage six—proclaimin' that One Vehicle loud and clear, doin' away with them three separate paths, givin' folks what they been searchin' for, and droppin' them old expedient means.

But even after showin' the truth, He still held back on that eternal permanence teaching. It wasn't till He was layin' by them Twin Trees, 'bout to cross over, that He finally sang out that mysterious song about the pure, eternal Self—stage seven, the final chorus.

Beyond all this, there's plenty more teachings, but if you gather 'em all up, this here's the main story. Just like all sounds come from five basic tones, and all them hundred schools of thought fit within six families.

Now this Immeasurable Meanings Sutra, even though the Lotus Sutra mentions it right up front, we here in China hadn't seen the actual text. Every time I'd sit down to teach, I'd have to stop and sigh, wishin' I could see this scripture with my own eyes.

Then one day, outta nowhere, here comes this monk named Hway-bee-ow from Mount Woo-dang. He was born among the Chee-ang people, nephew of that pretender emperor Yow Loo-eh. When that kingdom fell, he got taken by a Jin general name of Huh Dan-jur. Smart little thing he was, and Danzhi called him "Ming-ling" and raised him like his own son. Soon enough, the boy got permission to leave home and become a monk, and he worked hard seekin' the Way, travelin' north and south, didn't matter how rough the road got.

In the third year of the Jee-an Yoo-an period of the Qi dynasty, he went way down south searchin' for rare teachings, made it all the way to Guangzhou. At the Chow-ting Temple, he met this monk from Central India name of Dar-muh-gah-tuh-yah-sus, who could write Chinese characters and speak our language. The man wanted to transmit this sutra but didn't know who to give it to. Hway-bee-ow came up and asked real sincere, puttin' his whole heart and body into it, stayed there for months till he finally got himself a copy. Then he came back north and brought it up to Mount Woo-dang.

On the eighteenth day of the ninth month of the third year of Yong Ming, he came down from that mountain carryin' this sutra on his head, ready to share it far and wide. When I laid eyes on that true text, I was so happy I couldn't help but sing and dance—words just couldn't say what I was feelin'. So I went and consulted with some wise folks, scraped together my humble thoughts, and respectfully wrote this here preface and notes.

Now, the Ultimate Teaching comin' into this world gotta match the times, you see. The Divine Way saves folks different ways dependin' on how they respond. Out east in these parts, we call it the "Great One." Over west in Kashmir, they call it the "Correct Teaching." Eastern countries talk about blessings and troubles within a hundred years; Western lands speak of good and bad across three lifetimes. Hopin' for emptiness and cultivatin' emptiness—they both get to the same place, you know what I'm sayin'?

Folks who want to reach that emptiness without really lettin' go—they ain't got what it takes to truly get there. And them who put their mind on emptiness—they still ain't got that genuine insight into emptiness. But when folks study these Buddhist teachings, some say you gotta get there gradual, others say you gotta break through all at once. Let me tell you how I see it, try to make sense of this mystery.

Them who say it's gradual, they point out that everything in this world builds up slow. Ice starts with frost on your shoes, a mountain nine layers high starts with heaps of dirt. So when a student enters emptiness, even if they ain't got it perfect yet, it's like choppin' wood—you take off an inch, that inch is gone, you take off a foot, that foot's gone. Them three levels of emptiness come gradual, right? Ain't that gradual progress?

But them who say it's sudden, they say contemplation is key. The nature of reality comes from causes and conditions—it ain't real, but it ain't unreal neither. When you let go of all them thoughts about existence and non-existence, your understanding becomes one with truth—that's true emptiness. But if you still clingin' to ideas about what's real, your mind and truth stay separate—you still stuck in existence. When you just suppress your afflictions while still caught in existence, sure, you might see some daily improvement. But when you talk about emptiness while still thinkin', you ain't really entered the truth yet.

People say you can make someone an Arhat in one sermon, or judge someone's reached non-arising in one morning—that's just encouragement talk, not the real truth. That profound attainment ain't gradual; by its very nature, it gotta be sudden.

So these two views split apart, two paths arguin' with each other, one sayin' go, one sayin' stay, and can't neither one prove they're right.

Now when you look for them masters who really got the point, you gotta start with Jur and An. Master Jur's teaching on no-arising says that the seventh stage is complete in wisdom's shadow, and the tenth stage brings together all directions and abilities. The traces look different, but the insight's all one. Master An's teaching on different contemplations says that the Three Vehicles are what you call 'em at the start of the journey; concentration and wisdom are the real names when you reach the end. Meanin' you can start on three different paths accordin' to your capacity, but when you get to understanding, that wisdom ain't divided. The Parables Chapter says it too: once the great danger's passed, there ain't three ways no more; when the dangerous road ends, the expedient means disappear. So callin' One thing Three don't mean there's really three different awakenings, you see?

Master Sung-jow said: [Master Sung-jow] The practices of the Path can lead to neer-vah-nuh, but that ain't the same as bein' called an Arhat. The Six Perfections can get you to Buddhahood, but that ain't the same as sittin' under the Bo-dee tree. That wood-choppin' metaphor—the wood's still there, so inches and feet can be gradual. But when you witness no-arising, birth is completely done, so that insight gotta be sudden. When you look at the Three Vehicle teachings, they all about endin' birth and ceasing thoughts, leavin' existence and enterin' emptiness—that's the Way. You can't measure it by physical things.

Now this Immeasurable Meanings Sutra also takes formlessness as its foundation. If what people attain is really different, how could it be formless? If the insight when you break through is really the same, how could it be gradual? When it talks about "gradual," that's just expedient teaching, like a finger pointin' at the moon. The Tah-tah-gah-tuh even said: "Like tricking a child with an empty fist, that's how I save beings." Using subtle teachings to reach crude understandings—gradual explanations might work for that. But when you let go of the image and get the meaning, sudden realization makes more sense. I'm just sketching the broad outline here—y'all can decide for yourselves.

[Narrator] CHAPTER ONE: VIRTUOUS CONDUCT

Translated by Dar-muh-gah-tuh-yah-sus, Tripitaka Master from India, in the Shee-ow Chee dynasty

This is what I heard, oh yes:

One time, the Buddha was stayin' at Vulture Peak Mountain in the city of Rah-juh-gri-huh, and He had twelve thousand great monks gathered 'round Him, along with eighty thousand great bo-dee-sut-vuhs. There were gods and dragons, yuck-shus and gun-dar-vuhs, uh-soo-ruhs and guh-roo-duhs, kin-nuh-ruhs and ma-ho-rah-guhs, plus monks and nuns, laymen and laywomen—the whole assembly was there.

Great wheel-turning kings and small wheel-turning kings, gold-wheel and silver-wheel kings, all kinds of wheel-turning kings, regular kings, princes, ministers, citizens, gentlemen, ladies, and great elders—each one came with hundreds and thousands of their people surroundin' 'em. They all made their way to where the Buddha was, bowed down touchin' their heads to His feet, walked around Him a hundred thousand times, burnin' incense and scatterin' flowers, makin' all kinds of offerings. After they made their offerings to the Buddha, they stepped back and sat down to the side.

Now among them bo-dee-sut-vuhs were the great Dar-muh Princes—Mun-joo-shree, Great Majestic Virtue Treasury, Sorrowless Treasury, Great Eloquence Treasury—along with My-tray-yuh Bo-dee-sut-vuh, Chief Guide Bo-dee-sut-vuh, Medicine King and Medicine Superior Bo-dee-sut-vuhs.

There were the great compassionate ones—Ah-vuh-lo-kee-tesh-vah-ruh Bo-dee-sut-vuh, Ma-ha-stah-muh-prap-tuh Bo-dee-sut-vuh, Constant Vigor Bo-dee-sut-vuh—and the great wisdom holders: Flower Banner, Flower Light Banner, Dah-ruh-nee Self-Mastery King, Jewel Seal Hand, Jewel Accumulation, Jewel Staff, and Transcending the Three Realms Bo-dee-sut-vuhs.

And there were the mighty bo-dee-sut-vuhs—Lion's Roar King, Lion Sport in the World, Lion's Swift Advance, Lion's Vigor, Brave and Sharp Power, Lion's Majestic Subduing—along with Vim-uh-luh-keer-tee, Fragrant Elephant, Great Fragrant Elephant, Adornment, and Great Adornment Bo-dee-sut-vuhs. All these great bo-dee-sut-vuhs, eighty thousand of 'em gathered together.

Every last one of these bo-dee-sut-vuhs—they was masters of that Dar-muh-body, you hear? Accomplished in morality, accomplished in meditation, accomplished in wisdom. They had liberation, and they had the knowledge and vision of liberation. Their minds stayed peaceful, always restin' deep in suh-mah-dee—calm and tranquil, no tricks, no desire weighin' 'em down. Wrong views and confused thoughts couldn't get into 'em no more—no way, no how. They were still and clear, their aspirations profound and vast as space itself, unmoving for billions and billions of eons. Countless Dar-muh-doors appeared right before 'em, like doors openin' wide. They had great wisdom and penetrated all teachings, clearly seein' and distinguishin' the true characteristics and nature of things—existence and non-existence, long and short—all bright and plain as day.

They understood the capacities and desires of all beings, and with dah-ruh-nee and unobstructed eloquence, they requested the Buddha to turn the Dar-muh-wheel and could turn it themselves as His followers. Like the first drops of rain, they moistened the dust of desire, opened the gates of neer-vah-nuh, fanned the winds of liberation, removed the world's burning afflictions, and brought the coolness of the Dar-muh.

Next they rained down the profound Twelve Links of Dependent Origination, washin' away the blazing sunlight of suffering—ignorance, old age, sickness, and death. Then they poured out that supreme Great Vehicle teaching like a mighty flood, moistening all beings' good roots, plantin' good seeds across the whole field of merit, makin' everybody sprout them bo-dee-shoots. With the sun and moon of wisdom and the seasons of skillful means, they nourished and grew the great enterprise of the Great Vehicle, helpin' folks quickly achieve ah-noo-tah-rah-sum-yuck-sum-bo-dee—that supreme perfect enlightenment, you hear?—and dwell in eternal joy, subtle and true.

With immeasurable great compassion, they rescued suffering beings. They were the true good friends of all beings, the great fertile field of blessings for all beings, the teachers that nobody asked for but everybody needed, the safe and joyful refuge for all beings—the place of rescue, the place of protection, the great dwelling place. Everywhere they went, they were the great guides for the people.

They gave sight to the blind, gave hearin' to the deaf, gave noses to them without, gave tongues to the mute, made whole them whose faculties were damaged, brought right mind to the crazy and confused. They were the ship captain, the great ship captain, carryin' all beings across the river of birth and death to the shore of neer-vah-nuh. They were the medicine king, the great medicine king, distinguishin' the characteristics of illness, understandin' the properties of medicine, givin' folks the right cure for their sickness so they'd take it gladly.

They were the trainer, the great trainer, free from all careless behavior, like someone who trains elephants and horses—able to tame what can't be tamed, fierce and brave as a lion subduin' all beasts, hard to break or destroy. They played freely in the bo-dee-sut-vuhs' perfections, stood firm and unshakeable on the Tah-tah-gah-tuh ground, dwelt secure in their vow-power, extensively purified Buddha-lands, and were fixin' to soon achieve ah-noo-tah-rah-sum-yuck-sum-bo-dee. These great bo-dee-sut-vuhs all had inconceivable merits like this, yes indeed!

Now among them monks were: Great Wisdom Shah-ree-poo-truh, Spiritual Powers Mod-gal-yah-yuh-nuh, Wise Life Soo-boo-tee, Ma-ha-kat-yah-yuh-puh, Poor-nuh son of My-truh-yah-nee, Aj-nah-tuh-Kown-din-yuh, Heavenly Eye Ah-nee-rood-duh, Discipline-Keeper Oo-pah-lee, Attendant Ah-nun-duh, Buddha's Son Rah-hoo-luh, Oo-puh-nun-duh, Ray-vah-tuh, Gah-vum-pah-tee, Bah-koo-luh, Ah-choo-tuh, Svah-gah-tuh, Ma-ha-kash-yuh-puh the ascetic, Oo-roo-vil-vah-Kash-yuh-puh, Guy-uh-Kash-yuh-puh, and Nah-dee-Kash-yuh-puh. Twelve thousand monks like these, all of 'em arhats who'd exhausted their defilements, had no more bondage, and were truly and properly liberated.

Then Great Adornment Bo-dee-sut-vuh looked over the whole assembly, saw that everyone had settled their minds, and together with the eighty thousand great bo-dee-sut-vuhs, they rose from their seats and approached the Buddha. They bowed with their heads at His feet, circled Him a hundred thousand times, burned and scattered flowers, incense, robes, and jeweled necklaces—priceless treasures that came spinnin' down from the sky from all four directions as offerings to the Buddha. Heavenly kitchens and bowls overflowed with a hundred flavors—just seein' the colors and smellin' the fragrance made you naturally satisfied. Banners, flags, canopies, and wonderful musical instruments were placed everywhere. They made heavenly music to delight the Buddha.

Then they knelt down, put their palms together with one mind, and all together spoke this verse of praise:

[Great Adornment] "Great, oh great, the Great Awakened, Great Holy Lord,
Without stain, without defilement, without attachment,
Trainer of gods and humans, elephants and horses,
The wind of the Way, the fragrance of virtue, perfumin' everything.

Wisdom tranquil, emotions calm, thoughts settled still,
Intention ended, consciousness gone, mind also quiet,
Forever cut off from false dreams and wandering thoughts,
No more five aggregates, sense-realms, or entries.

His body neither exists nor doesn't exist,
Not caused, not conditioned, not self, not other,
Not square, not round, not short, not long,
Not appearing, not disappearing, not born, not dying—
Beyond all forms!

Not made, not arisen, not done, not created,
Not sitting, not lying, not walking, not standing,
Not moving, not turning, not busy, not still,
Not advancing, not retreating, not safe, not in danger—
Can't pin Him down!

Neither right nor wrong, neither gain nor loss,
Neither that nor this, neither going nor coming,
Not blue, not yellow, not red, not white,
Not crimson, not purple, none of them various colors—
The Buddha's got no limits!

Yet from precepts, meditation, wisdom, liberation, knowledge and vision arise,
The three clarities and six spiritual powers and path-factors emerge,
Compassion and the ten powers and fearlessness spring up,
Brought forth by the good karma and conditions of living beings.

He shows Himself as sixteen feet tall with purple-golden radiance,
Square and upright, shinin' bright and clear,
The mark between His brows like the moon, His neck like the sun's light,
His hair in spirals of deep blue, the crown of His head raised high,

His pure eyes shinin' clear, lookin' up and down,
His eyebrows like indigo, stretched out, His face and cheeks square,
His lips and tongue beautiful red like the vermillion fruit,
His forty white teeth like pearl shells in the snow,

His forehead broad, His nose high, His face open,
On His chest the swastika mark, His breast like a lion's,
His hands and feet soft, marked with thousand-spoked wheels,
His armpits and palms joined smooth, perfect inside and out,

His arms long, His elbows lengthy, His fingers straight and slender,
His skin fine and soft, His body-hair curlin' to the right,
His ankles and knees concealed, His male organ withdrawn like a horse's,
Fine sinews and locked bones, calves like a deer's,

Inside and out shinin' through, pure without stain,
Pure water can't wet Him, dust can't touch Him.
These thirty-two marks and such,
And eighty minor characteristics seem visible,

Yet really there's no mark, no mark-form,
All forms that eyes could see are cut off,
The markless mark has a marked body,
And living beings' body-marks are the same way.

He makes living beings joyfully bow down,
With sincere hearts showin' respect, earnest and diligent,
Through this, their pride and arrogance are removed,
Accomplishin' such a wonderful form.

We eighty thousand and all our companions,
Together bow our heads and take refuge,
In the One who's ended thoughts, mind, and consciousness,
The trainer of elephants and horses, the unattached sage.

We bow and take refuge in the Dar-muh-body,
The gathering of precepts, meditation, wisdom, liberation, knowledge and vision.
We bow and take refuge in the wonderful mark-adorned One,
We bow and take refuge in the inconceivable One.

His voice like Brah-muh's thunder soundin' in eight tones,
Subtle, pure, profound, and far-reaching,
The Four Truths, Six Perfections, Twelve Links,
Turnin' accordin' to the minds and karma of living beings,

Everyone who hears opens their mind and heart,
Cuttin' off countless bonds of birth and death.
Some hearin' attain stream-entry,
Once-returning, non-returning, arhatship,

The undefiled, unconditioned place of solitary awakening,
The unborn, undying ground of bo-dee-sut-vuhs.
Some attain countless dah-ruh-nees,
Unobstructed joyful eloquence and great skill in speech,

proclaimin' profound and subtle verses,
Sportin' and bathin' in the pure Dar-muh-pool.
Some leap and fly, manifestin' spiritual powers,
Emergin' from and enterin' water and fire, their bodies free,

Such is the mark of this Dar-muh-wheel,
Pure, limitless, inconceivable.
We all together bow our heads again,
Takin' refuge in the Dar-muh-wheel turned in its season.

We bow and take refuge in the Brah-muh-voice,
We bow and take refuge in conditions, truths, and perfections.
The World-Honored One in past countless eons,
Diligently and painfully cultivated all virtuous conduct,

For us—humans, gods, dragons, and spirit-kings,
And universally for all living beings.
Able to give up all that's hard to give up,
Wealth and treasures, wife and children, even kingdoms and cities,

In the Dar-muh, inside and out, holdin' nothin' back,
Even head, eyes, marrow, and brain all given to others.

He upheld the pure precepts of all Buddhas,
Never breakin' 'em even if it cost His life,
Even when folks came at Him with weapons,
With harsh words and insults, He never got angry.

Through countless eons, pushin' His body without laziness,
Day and night collectin' His mind, always in meditation,
He learned all the various teachings and paths,
His wisdom penetratin' deep into the roots of living beings.

That's why now He's got that sovereign power,
Sovereign in the Dar-muh as the Dar-muh King,
We all together bow our heads,
Takin' refuge in the One who endured all that's hard to endure."


[Narrator] CHAPTER TWO: PREACHING THE DHARMA

Then Great Adornment Bo-dee-sut-vuh and the eighty thousand great bo-dee-sut-vuhs, after speakin' this verse praisin' the Buddha, all said to the Buddha: [Great Adornment] "World-Honored One! We eighty thousand bo-dee-sut-vuhs now want to ask somethin' within the Tah-tah-gah-tuh's Dar-muh. We don't know if the World-Honored One will be kind enough to listen or not?"

[Narrator] The Buddha told Great Adornment Bo-dee-sut-vuh and the eighty thousand bo-dee-sut-vuhs: [Buddha] "Excellent! Excellent! Good sons! You know well that now is the time—ask whatever you want. The Tah-tah-gah-tuh won't be long before enterin' neer-vah-nuh. After neer-vah-nuh, I want to make sure everybody's got no more doubts. Whatever you want to ask, go ahead and speak."

[Narrator] Then Great Adornment Bo-dee-sut-vuh and the eighty thousand bo-dee-sut-vuhs, all speakin' together with one voice, said to the Buddha: [Great Adornment] "World-Honored One! If a great bo-dee-sut-vuh wants to quickly achieve ah-noo-tah-rah-sum-yuck-sum-bo-dee, what Dar-muh-door should he practice? What Dar-muh-door can enable a great bo-dee-sut-vuh to quickly achieve ah-noo-tah-rah-sum-yuck-sum-bo-dee?"

[Narrator] The Buddha told Great Adornment Bo-dee-sut-vuh and the eighty thousand bo-dee-sut-vuhs: [Buddha] "Good sons! There's one Dar-muh-door that can enable bo-dee-sut-vuhs to quickly attain ah-noo-tah-rah-sum-yuck-sum-bo-dee. If there's a bo-dee-sut-vuh who studies this Dar-muh-door, then he can quickly attain ah-noo-tah-rah-sum-yuck-sum-bo-dee."

[Great Adornment] "World-Honored One! What's this Dar-muh-door called? What does it mean? How should a bo-dee-sut-vuh practice it?"

[Narrator] The Buddha said: [Buddha] "Good sons! This one Dar-muh-door—it's called Immeasurable Meanings. Now if a bo-dee-sut-vuh wants to study Immeasurable Meanings, here's what he should do: contemplate all phenomena. From the very beginning until right now, their nature and characteristics been empty and still. They ain't great, they ain't small. They don't arise, they don't cease. They don't abide, they don't move. They ain't advancin', they ain't retreatin'. Like empty space—there ain't two natures to it. But living beings, through their confused thinkin', they say 'this is this' and 'that is that,' 'this here's gain' and 'that there's loss.' They give rise to unwholesome thoughts, create all kinds of evil karma, and cycle through the six realms, experiencin' all kinds of sufferin' and poison. Through immeasurable billions of eons, they can't get themselves out.

"When a great bo-dee-sut-vuh contemplates truly like this, he gives rise to a mind of compassion, sends forth great loving-kindness and great compassion, and wants to rescue beings. He also deeply enters all phenomena—how they arise, how they abide, how they change, how they cease. How they birth evil, how they birth good. Abiding, changing, and ceasing all follow the same pattern.

"When a bo-dee-sut-vuh contemplates the four characteristics from beginning to end and fully knows them all, then he truthfully contemplates all phenomena—moment by moment, not abiding, newly arising and ceasing each instant. He also contemplates arising, abiding, changing, and ceasing in the very same moment. After contemplatin' like this, he enters into the capacities and desires of living beings. Because the desires are immeasurable, the Dar-muh he teaches is immeasurable. Because the Dar-muh taught is immeasurable, the meanings are also immeasurable. Immeasurable meanings arise from one Dar-muh. That one Dar-muh is formlessness itself. This formlessness—formless yet not-form, not-form yet formless—is called true characteristic. When a great bo-dee-sut-vuh dwells securely in this true characteristic, the compassion he sends forth is clear and true, not false. For living beings, he can truly pull out their suffering. Once the suffering is pulled out, he then teaches them the Dar-muh, enabling all living beings to receive happiness and joy.

"Good sons! If a bo-dee-sut-vuh can practice this one Dar-muh-door of Immeasurable Meanings like this, he will certainly quickly achieve ah-noo-tah-rah-sum-yuck-sum-bo-dee. Good sons! This profound supreme Great Vehicle Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings has true and correct principles and words, supremely honored with nothing above it. The Buddhas of the three times all protect it together. No demons or heretical paths can enter it. It cannot be destroyed by any wrong views or birth-and-death. Therefore, good sons! If a great bo-dee-sut-vuh wants to quickly achieve supreme bo-dee, he should study this profound supreme Great Vehicle Sutra of Immeasurable Meanings."

[Narrator] Then Great Adornment Bo-dee-sut-vuh said to the Buddha again: [Great Adornment] "World-Honored One! The Dar-muh You teach is inconceivable, the capacities of living beings are also inconceivable, and the liberation of Dar-muh-doors is also inconceivable. We have no more doubts about the Dar-muh You've taught, but living beings might get confused minds, so we're askin' again.

"Lord! Ever since the Tah-tah-gah-tuh attained the Way, for over forty years now, You've constantly been teaching living beings about the four characteristics—about suffering, emptiness, impermanence and no-self, nothing great, nothing small, no arising, no ceasing, everything formless, Dar-muh-nature and Dar-muh-characteristics originally empty and still, not coming, not going, not emerging, not disappearing. Those who heard attained the heat Dar-muh, the peak Dar-muh, the supreme worldly Dar-muh; stream-entry fruit, once-returning fruit, non-returning fruit, arhat fruit; the way of the solitary Buddha; arousing the bo-dee-mind; climbing the first ground, second, third, all the way to the tenth ground.

"What You taught in the past—how is that different from what You're teachin' today? Yet You say that this profound supreme Great Vehicle Immeasurable Meanings Sutra, when practiced by bo-dee-sut-vuhs, will definitely enable them to quickly achieve supreme bo-dee. How can this be? We only wish You would have compassion for everyone and explain this in detail for living beings, so that those who hear the Dar-muh now and in the future will have no remaining doubts."

[Narrator] Then the Buddha told Great Adornment Bo-dee-sut-vuh: [Buddha] "Excellent! Excellent! Great good son! You can ask the Tah-tah-gah-tuh about such profound supreme Great Vehicle subtle meanings. You should know that you're able to greatly benefit and bring peace and joy to gods and humans, pullin' suffering beings out of their misery. This is true great compassion, sincere and not false. Because of these causes and conditions, you will certainly quickly achieve supreme bo-dee, and you'll also enable all beings, now and in the future, to achieve supreme bo-dee.

"Good son! Ever since I sat under the bo-dee tree at the site of enlightenment for six years and achieved ah-noo-tah-rah-sum-yuck-sum-bo-dee, with the Buddha-eye I contemplated all phenomena and found they couldn't be spoken. Why is that? Because the natures and desires of living beings aren't the same. Because their natures and desires aren't the same, I teach the Dar-muh in various ways. Teaching the Dar-muh in various ways, using skillful means, for over forty years I haven't yet revealed the truth. Therefore, living beings attain the Way differently and don't quickly achieve supreme bo-dee.

"Good son! The Dar-muh is like water—whether it's a well, pond, river, stream, canal, or the great ocean, they all wash away dirt and filth. That Dar-muh-water washes away the dirt of all living beings' afflictions.

"Good son! Water's nature is one, but the vessels are different. The Dar-muh-nature is also like this—washin' away the toil of the dust equally without difference, but the three Dar-muhs, four fruits, and two paths aren't the same.

"Good son! Although water washes the same way, a well ain't a pond, a pond ain't a river, and streams and canals ain't the ocean. Yet the Tah-tah-gah-tuh, the World-Hero, is sovereign in the Dar-muh, and the Dar-muh He teaches is also like this. The early teaching, the middle teaching, and the later teaching all can wash away living beings' afflictions. But the early ain't the middle, and the middle ain't the later. The early, middle, and later teachings—though the words may be the same, the meanings are different.

"Good son! When I rose from beneath the Tree King and went to Deer Park at Vah-rah-nah-see, I turned the Dar-muh-wheel of the Four Noble Truths for Aj-nah-tuh-Kown-din-yuh and his five companions. At that time, I also taught that all phenomena have been originally empty and still, constantly changing, arising and ceasing moment by moment. Then in between, here and there, for monks and many bo-dee-sut-vuhs, I clearly explained and taught the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination and the Six Perfections—I also taught that all phenomena are originally empty and still, constantly changing, arising and ceasing moment by moment. Now again, here, I'm teachin' the Great Vehicle Immeasurable Meanings Sutra, and I'm also teaching that all phenomena are originally empty and still, constantly changing, arising and ceasing moment by moment.

"Good son! Therefore, the early teaching, the middle teaching, and the present teaching—the words are the same, but the meanings are different. Because the meanings are different, living beings' understanding is different. Because understanding is different, the Dar-muh they attain, the fruits they attain, and the Way they attain are also different.

"Good son! When I first taught the Four Truths for those seeking to be voice-hearers, eight hundred million gods came down to listen to the Dar-muh and aroused the bo-dee-mind. In the middle, everywhere I deeply taught the Twelve Links of Dependent Origination for those seeking to be solitary Buddhas, and immeasurable beings aroused the bo-dee-mind, or dwelt in the voice-hearer stage. Next, I taught the twelve divisions of the Vy-pool-yuh scriptures, the Ma-ha-praj-nah-pah-rah-mee-tuh, and the Ah-vah-tum-sah-kuh Ocean Cloud, explaining how bo-dee-sut-vuhs cultivate through the eons. Yet hundreds of thousands of monks, millions and billions of gods and humans, and immeasurable beings attained stream-entry, once-returning, non-returning, arhatship, or dwelt in the causes and conditions of the solitary Buddha Dar-muh.

"Good son! For this reason, you know that though the teaching is the same, the meanings are different. Because the meanings are different, living beings' understanding is different. Because understanding is different, the Dar-muh, fruits, and Way they attain are also different. Therefore, good son! Ever since I attained the Way and first began teaching the Dar-muh, right up till today teaching the Great Vehicle Immeasurable Meanings Sutra, I ain't never not taught about suffering, emptiness, impermanence, and no-self, not true, not false, not great, not small, originally not aflame, now also not extinguished, everything formless, Dar-muh-characteristics and Dar-muh-nature not coming and not going—yet living beings are moved by the four characteristics.

"Good son! For this reason, the Buddhas don't have two words. They can respond to all voices with one sound. They can manifest hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of nah-yoo-tahs, immeasurable, countless Ganges sands of bodies with one body. In each body, they again manifest so many hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of nah-yoo-tahs, incalculable, Ganges sands of various forms. In each form, they again manifest so many hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of nah-yoo-tahs, incalculable, Ganges sands of forms. Good son! This here is the Buddhas' inconceivable profound realm, you hear? Them two vehicles can't know it, and the bo-dee-sut-vuhs of the ten stages can't reach it neither. Only Buddha and Buddha can fully fathom it.

"Good son! Therefore, I say this subtle, profound, supreme Great Vehicle Immeasurable Meanings Sutra has true and correct principles and words, supremely honored with nothing above it. The Buddhas of the three times all protect it together. No demons or outside paths can enter it. It cannot be destroyed by any wrong views or birth-and-death. If a great bo-dee-sut-vuh wants to quickly achieve supreme bo-dee, he should study this profound supreme Great Vehicle Immeasurable Meanings Sutra."

[Narrator] When the Buddha finished speakin' these words, right then the whole three-thousand great thousandfold world shook in six ways. And don't you know the sky opened up—all them heavenly flowers rainin' down, blue lotus and red, white and great white, heavenly incense and robes and jewels spinnin' down, offerings for the Buddha and all them bo-dee-sut-vuhs and voice-hearers and the whole great assembly. Heavenly kitchens and heavenly bowls overflowed with a hundred flavors—just seein' the colors and smellin' the fragrance made you naturally satisfied. Heavenly banners and flags, canopies and wonderful musical instruments were placed everywhere, and heavenly music was played, singin' praise of the Buddha.

And again it shook in six ways—in the eastern direction and throughout all ten directions, Buddha-worlds as numerous as Ganges sands rained down the same heavenly offerings, making music and singin' praise of the Buddha, the bo-dee-sut-vuhs, voice-hearers, and the great assembly.

Then among the assembly, thirty-two thousand great bo-dee-sut-vuhs attained the suh-mah-dee of Immeasurable Meanings. Thirty-four thousand great bo-dee-sut-vuhs attained countless immeasurable dah-ruh-nee-doors and were able to turn the irreversible Dar-muh-wheel of all Buddhas of the three times.

Among all those monks and nuns, laymen and laywomen, gods and dragons, kings and ministers, citizens and elders—hundreds and thousands gathered together—when they heard the Buddha teach this sutra, realizations bloomed like flowers after rain.

Some attained the heat Dar-muh, the peak Dar-muh, the supreme worldly Dar-muh. Some attained stream-entry fruit, once-returning fruit, non-returning fruit, arhat fruit, solitary Buddha fruit. Others attained the bo-dee-sut-vuh's patient acceptance of the non-arising of phenomena.

And the dah-ruh-nees! Some attained one dah-ruh-nee, some two, some three, four, five—all the way to ten dah-ruh-nees. Some attained hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of dah-ruh-nees. Some attained immeasurable, countless, Ganges sands, incalculable dah-ruh-nees!

They were all able to turn the irreversible Dar-muh-wheel accordingly. Immeasurable beings aroused the mind of ah-noo-tah-rah-sum-yuck-sum-bo-dee.

[Narrator] Then Great Adornment Bo-dee-sut-vuh, witnessing these wondrous results, spoke to the Buddha again:


[Narrator] CHAPTER THREE: THE TEN POWERS OF MERIT

Then Great Adornment Bo-dee-sut-vuh said to the Buddha again: [Great Adornment] "World-Honored One! This subtle, profound, supreme Great Vehicle Immeasurable Meanings Sutra that the World-Honored One has taught is truly profound! Profound, profound! Why is that? Among this assembly—the great bo-dee-sut-vuhs and the fourfold assembly, gods, dragons, ghosts, spirits, kings, ministers, citizens, all beings—those who heard this profound supreme Great Vehicle Immeasurable Meanings Sutra all attained dah-ruh-nee-doors, the three Dar-muhs, the four fruits, and the bo-dee-mind. You should know this sutra has true and correct principles and words, supremely honored with nothing above it. The Buddhas of the three times all protect it. No demons or heretical groups can enter it. It cannot be destroyed by any wrong views or birth-and-death.

"Why is that? Because hearing it once, you can uphold all Dar-muhs. If beings get to hear this sutra, that's a great benefit. Why is that? If they can practice it, they will certainly quickly achieve ah-noo-tah-rah-sum-yuck-sum-bo-dee. Those beings who don't get to hear it—you should know they're losin' a great benefit. Through immeasurable, limitless, inconceivable, incalculable eons, they'll never achieve ah-noo-tah-rah-sum-yuck-sum-bo-dee. Why is that? Because they don't know the straight great path of bo-dee, they walk on dangerous trails and face many obstacles.

"World-Honored One! This sutra is inconceivable. We only wish the World-Honored One would compassionately explain broadly for the great assembly the profoundly inconceivable matters of this sutra. World-Honored One! Where does this sutra come from? Where does it go to? Where does it dwell? How does it have such immeasurable merit and inconceivable power, enabling beings to quickly achieve ah-noo-tah-rah-sum-yuck-sum-bo-dee?"

[Narrator] Then the World-Honored One told Great Adornment Bo-dee-sut-vuh: [Buddha] "Excellent! Excellent! Good son! Yes, yes, just as you say. Good son! I say this sutra is profound, profound! Truly profound! Why is that? Because it enables beings to quickly achieve ah-noo-tah-rah-sum-yuck-sum-bo-dee. Hearing it once, you can uphold all Dar-muhs. It's of great benefit to all beings. It's the great straight path without obstacles.

"Good son! You ask where this sutra comes from, where it goes to, and where it dwells—listen well and carefully. Good son! This sutra originally comes from the palaces of the Buddhas. It goes to all beings arousing the bo-dee-mind. It dwells in the places where bo-dee-sut-vuhs practice. Good son! This sutra comes like this, goes like this, and dwells like this. Therefore, this sutra has such immeasurable merit and inconceivable power, enabling beings to quickly achieve ah-noo-tah-rah-sum-yuck-sum-bo-dee. Good son! Would you like to hear about the ten more inconceivable powers of merit of this sutra?"

[Narrator] Great Adornment said: [Great Adornment] "Yes, we'd be glad to hear it."

[Narrator] The Buddha said: [Buddha] "Good son! First, this sutra can make bo-dee-sut-vuhs who haven't aroused the mind arouse the bo-dee-mind. Those without compassion? They give rise to compassionate minds. Those who like killin'? They give rise to great compassionate minds. Jealous folks give rise to minds of rejoicing; attached folks give rise to minds of lettin' go; the stingy and greedy give rise to minds of generosity. The arrogant give rise to minds of keeping precepts; the angry give rise to minds of patience; the lazy give rise to minds of vigor. The scattered give rise to minds of meditation; the foolish give rise to minds of wisdom. Those unable to save others give rise to minds of saving others. Those who do the ten evils give rise to minds of the ten virtues; those who enjoy conditioned things turn their minds toward the unconditioned. Those with retreating minds develop non-retreating minds; those with outflows give rise to minds without outflows; those with many afflictions give rise to minds of eliminating afflictions.

"You hear? This sutra turns hearts around—that's its first power. Good son! This is called the first merit of inconceivable power of this sutra.

"Good son! Second, the inconceivable power of merit of this sutra: If beings get this sutra, even if just one turning, one verse, or even one sentence, they can penetrate hundreds of thousands of billions of meanings, and through immeasurable countless eons, they won't be able to finish explainin' all they've received and upheld. Why is that? Because this Dar-muh has immeasurable meanings.

"Good son! This sutra is like one seed producing hundreds of thousands of millions—and in those hundreds of thousands of millions, each one again produces hundreds of thousands of millions. Expanding like this until immeasurable. This sutra is also like this—from one Dar-muh arise hundreds of thousands of meanings; in those hundreds of thousands of meanings, each one again produces hundreds of thousands of millions. Expanding like this until immeasurable, limitless meanings. Therefore, this sutra is called Immeasurable Meanings. Good son! This is called the second merit of inconceivable power of this sutra.

"Good son! Third, the inconceivable power of merit of this sutra: If beings hear this sutra, even if just one turning, one verse, or even one sentence, and penetrate hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of meanings, though they have afflictions, it's like having no afflictions. Going out of birth and entering death, they have no thoughts of fear. For all beings, they give rise to compassionate minds. For all Dar-muhs, they gain the thought of courage and strength. Like a strong man who can carry and hold heavy things, those who uphold this sutra are also like this—able to shoulder the heavy treasure of supreme bo-dee, bearing living beings out of the path of birth and death. Though unable to save themselves, they're already able to save others.

"It's like a ship captain whose body is afflicted with serious illness, whose four limbs don't work, restin' on this shore, but he has a good, solid boat always prepared with everything needed to ferry others across, and he gives it to them and lets them go. Those who uphold this sutra are also like this—though afflicted with the body of the five paths of existence, constantly entangled by the 108 serious illnesses, restin' on this shore of ignorance, old age, and death, they have this solid Great Vehicle sutra of Immeasurable Meanings, prepared to ferry beings across. Those who can practice as taught will cross over birth and death. Good son! This is called the third merit of inconceivable power of this sutra.

"Good son! Fourth, the inconceivable power of merit of this sutra: If beings hear this sutra, even just one turning, one verse, one sentence, they gain the thought of courage and strength. Though not yet saving themselves, they're able to save others and are accompanied by great bo-dee-sut-vuhs. The Buddhas always teach the Dar-muh to such people, and they receive it all, followin' without resistance.

"Good son! Such a person is like a newborn prince—whether one day old or seven years old, though he can't yet govern the kingdom, he's already honored by all the ministers and people. The other great princes are his companions. The king and queen especially love him and constantly talk with him. Why? Because he's still young, you see?

"Good son! Those who uphold this sutra are the same way. Though they can't yet shake the three-thousand great thousandfold world with the Dar-muh-wheel, they're already honored by the fourfold assembly. The great bo-dee-sut-vuhs are their companions. The Buddhas protect and love them—because they're new learners. Good son! This is called the fourth merit of inconceivable power of this sutra.

"Good son! Fifth, the inconceivable power of merit of this sutra: If good sons and good daughters, whether when the Buddha is in the world or after His passing, receive, uphold, read, recite, and copy this profound supreme Great Vehicle Immeasurable Meanings Sutra, such people, though still fully bound by afflictions and unable to distance themselves from ordinary worldly matters, are able to manifest the great bo-dee path. They can extend one day to be a hundred eons, and they can also compress a hundred eons into one day, makin' living beings joyfully believe and submit. Good son! Such good sons and good daughters are like a dragon's child—just seven days after birth, it can already raise clouds and also bring down rain. Good son! This is called the fifth merit of inconceivable power of this sutra.

"Good son! Sixth, the inconceivable power of merit of this sutra: If good sons and good daughters receive and uphold this sutra, though they have afflictions, they teach the Dar-muh to beings, enabling them to leave behind afflictions and birth-and-death, cutting off all suffering. After beings hear it and practice, they attain Dar-muh, attain fruits, attain the Way, equal to the Buddha Tah-tah-gah-tuh without difference.

"It's like a prince who, though still young, when the king goes on tour or is sick, is entrusted to govern the kingdom. The prince follows the great king's command, gives teachings to all the ministers according to the Dar-muh, spreadin' correct influence. The people of the land each rest in peace, just like when the great king governs—without any difference. Good sons and good daughters who uphold the sutra are the same way. Though they haven't yet attained the first immovable ground, relying on the Buddha's teaching, they explain it true. Beings hear it, practice with one mind, cut off afflictions, and attain the Way. Good son! This is called the sixth merit of inconceivable power of this sutra.

"Good son! Seventh, the inconceivable power of merit of this sutra: If good sons and good daughters hear this sutra, rejoice, believe, delight in it, give rise to a rare mind, receive, uphold, read, recite, copy, explain it, practice it according to the Dar-muh, arouse the bo-dee-mind, give rise to all good roots, raise up great compassionate intention—wanting to save all suffering beings—listen now! Though they haven't yet practiced the Six Perfections, the Six Perfections naturally appear before them. Right in this body they attain patient acceptance of the non-arising of phenomena. Birth-and-death and afflictions are simultaneously destroyed, and they immediately ascend to the seventh ground and receive the rank of great bo-dee-sut-vuh!

"It's like a warrior eliminatin' enemies for the king. After the enemies are destroyed, the king is greatly pleased and rewards him with half the kingdom's territory, completely givin' it to him. Men and women who uphold the sutra are the same—among all practitioners, they're the most courageous and strong! The treasure of the six perfections Dar-muhs comes without seeking. The enemies of birth and death naturally scatter and are destroyed. They realize patient acceptance of non-arising and are rewarded with half the Buddha's kingdom's treasure in peace and joy. Good son! This is called the seventh merit of inconceivable power of this sutra.

"Good son! Eighth, the inconceivable power of merit of this sutra: If good sons and good daughters get this sutra, respect and believe in it as if viewing the Buddha's body itself, love and delight in this sutra, receive, uphold, read, recite, copy, carry it on their heads, practice it according to the Dar-muh, firmly keep precepts and patience, practice the perfection of giving, deeply send forth compassion, and broadly explain this supreme Great Vehicle Immeasurable Meanings Sutra to others—if there's someone who previously didn't believe in sin and blessings at all, show them this sutra, set up various skillful means, and strongly transform them to make them believe. Through the awesome power of the sutra, their minds are suddenly turned around! Once the believing mind arises, they courageously advance with vigor. Through the power of this sutra's majestic virtue, they attain the Way and attain fruits.

"Therefore, good sons and good daughters, right in this body, attain patient acceptance of the non-arising of phenomena, reach the upper ground, are accompanied by all bo-dee-sut-vuhs, quickly accomplish purifying Buddha-lands and achieving beings, and soon attain supreme bo-dee. Good son! This is called the eighth merit of inconceivable power of this sutra.

"Good son! Ninth, the inconceivable power of merit of this sutra—and this one's powerful now, you hear? If good sons and good daughters get this sutra, rejoice and leap with joy, experiencing what they've never had before, receive, uphold, read, recite, copy, make offerings, broadly explain and interpret the meaning of this sutra for many people—their remaining karma, leftover sins, and heavy obstacles all extinguished at once! Then they attain purity, gain great eloquence, adorn in sequence all the perfections, obtain all the suh-mah-dees and the heroic suh-mah-dee, enter the great dah-ruh-nee door, gain diligent vigor power, quickly transcend the upper grounds. They skillfully divide their bodies and scatter themselves throughout the ten directions, pulling out and saving all beings in the twenty-five states of existence who experience extreme suffering, enabling them all to gain liberation! Therefore, this sutra has such power. Good son! This is called the ninth merit of inconceivable power of this sutra.

"Good son! Tenth—and now we come to the final power, the culmination of all these merits—the inconceivable power of merit of this sutra: If good sons and good daughters get this sutra and give rise to great joy, give rise to a rare mind, themselves receive, uphold, read, recite, copy, make offerings, practice as taught, and also broadly encourage both householders and those who've left home to receive, uphold, read, recite, copy, make offerings, explain, and practice according to the Dar-muh—thereby causing others to practice—through the power of this sutra, they attain the Way and attain fruits, all due to the power of that good son's or good daughter's compassionate mind diligently transforming them.

"Now listen to what happens to such good sons and good daughters, you hear? Right in this body, they immediately attain immeasurable dah-ruh-nee doors. On the ground of ordinary beings, naturally from the very beginning, they're able to send forth countless incalculable great vows of vast scope. They're deeply able to send forth the saving of all living beings, accomplish great compassion, broadly able to rescue suffering. They thickly gather good roots, benefit everyone, pour forth the moisture of Dar-muh, abundantly moistening the parched and dried up. They refine all living beings with the medicine of many Dar-muhs, bring peace and joy to everyone, gradually see them ascend and climb, dwell on the Dar-muh Cloud ground. They spread kindness's moisture universally, compassion covering without limit, gathering up suffering beings, causing them to enter the path.

"Therefore, such a person will soon achieve ah-noo-tah-rah-sum-yuck-sum-bo-dee! Good son! This is called the tenth merit of inconceivable power of this sutra.

"Good son! This supreme Great Vehicle Immeasurable Meanings Sutra has extremely great mighty spiritual power, supremely honored with nothing above it. It can enable all ordinary beings to all achieve sagehood fruits, forever leaving birth and death and gaining freedom. Therefore, this sutra is called Immeasurable Meanings. It can enable all living beings on the ground of ordinary beings to give rise to the immeasurable path-sprouts of bo-dee-sut-vuhs, causing the tree of merit to flourish, spread out abundantly, and grow. Therefore, this sutra is called the Ten Powers of Inconceivable Merit."

[Narrator] Then Great Adornment Bo-dee-sut-vuh and the eighty thousand great bo-dee-sut-vuhs all said to the Buddha together with one voice: [Great Adornment] "World-Honored One! This teaching has shaken our very souls! These ten powers of inconceivable merit—we've witnessed 'em with our own eyes, seen this whole assembly transformed before us. Your compassion in revealing this profound Dar-muh has given us a gift we can never repay. We're filled with joy, yes we are! Filled with gratitude beyond measure!"

[Narrator] Then the three-thousand great thousandfold world shook in six ways once more, you hear? The heavens opened again—flowers rainin' down from every direction, incense and robes, jewels and necklaces, bowls overflowin' with flavors, music playin' sweet and clear. Just seein' the colors and smellin' the fragrance naturally satisfied everyone, fillin' their souls.

And again it shook in six ways throughout all ten directions. Buddha-worlds as numerous as Ganges sands made the same heavenly offerings, all singin' praise, all rejoicin'.

[Narrator] Then the Buddha told Great Adornment Bo-dee-sut-vuh and the eighty thousand great bo-dee-sut-vuhs: [Buddha] "Y'all should give rise to deep respect for this sutra, practice it according to the Dar-muh, broadly transform everyone, diligently spread it, always be earnest day and night in protectin' it, universally enabling all beings to each obtain Dar-muh benefit. Y'all truly have great loving-kindness and great compassion. Establish your spiritual powers and vow-power to protect this sutra, don't let there be doubts and hesitation. In the future age, you must make it spread widely throughout Jam-boo-dvee-puh, enabling all living beings to be able to see, hear, read, recite, copy, and make offerings. Because of this, y'all will also quickly attain ah-noo-tah-rah-sum-yuck-sum-bo-dee."

[Narrator] At that time, Great Adornment Bo-dee-sut-vuh and the eighty thousand great bo-dee-sut-vuhs immediately rose from their seats, approached the Buddha, bowed with their heads at His feet, circled Him a hundred thousand times, then knelt before Him, all together with one voice, and said to the Buddha: [Great Adornment] "World-Honored One! We're so blessed to receive the World-Honored One's compassion in explainin' this profound, subtle, supreme Great Vehicle Immeasurable Meanings Sutra for us. We respectfully receive the Buddha's instruction. After the Tah-tah-gah-tuh's passing, we will broadly cause this sutra to spread, universally enabling everyone to receive, uphold, read, recite, copy, and make offerings. We only wish the World-Honored One wouldn't worry. We will, through our vow-power, universally enable all living beings to be able to see, hear, read, recite, copy, make offerings, and obtain the mighty spiritual power of this sutra's Dar-muh."

[Narrator] Then the Buddha praised them, sayin': [Buddha] "Excellent! Excellent! Good sons! Y'all now are truly Buddha's children, with great loving-kindness and great compassion, deeply able to pull out suffering and rescue from distress. Y'all are the good fertile field of blessings for all living beings, broadly serving as great good guides for everyone, the great dwelling place for all living beings, the great benefactors for all living beings, constantly broadly giving Dar-muh benefit to everyone."

[Narrator] Then the whole great assembly was filled with great joy. They bowed to the Buddha, received and upheld the teaching, and departed.

---END---
