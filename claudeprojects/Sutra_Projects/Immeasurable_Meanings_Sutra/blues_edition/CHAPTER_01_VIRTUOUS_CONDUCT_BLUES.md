## CHAPTER ONE: VIRTUOUS CONDUCT

*Translated by Dharmāgatayaśas, Tripiṭaka Master from India, in the Xiao Qi dynasty*

This is what I heard, oh yes:

One time, the Buddha was stayin' at Vulture Peak Mountain in the city of Rājagṛha, and He had twelve thousand great monks gathered 'round Him, along with eighty thousand great bodhisattvas. There were gods and dragons, yakṣas and gandharvas, asuras and garuḍas, kinnaras and mahoragas, plus monks and nuns, laymen and laywomen—the whole assembly was there.

Great wheel-turning kings and small wheel-turning kings, gold-wheel and silver-wheel kings, all kinds of wheel-turning kings, regular kings, princes, ministers, citizens, gentlemen, ladies, and great elders—each one came with hundreds and thousands of their people surroundin' 'em. They all made their way to where the Buddha was, bowed down touchin' their heads to His feet, walked around Him a hundred thousand times, burnin' incense and scatterin' flowers, makin' all kinds of offerings. After they made their offerings to the Buddha, they stepped back and sat down to the side.

Now among them bodhisattvas were the great Dharma Princes—Mañjuśrī, Great Majestic Virtue Treasury, Sorrowless Treasury, Great Eloquence Treasury—along with Maitreya Bodhisattva, Chief Guide Bodhisattva, Medicine King and Medicine Superior Bodhisattvas.

There were the great compassionate ones—Avalokiteśvara Bodhisattva, Mahāsthāmaprāpta Bodhisattva, Constant Vigor Bodhisattva—and the great wisdom holders: Flower Banner, Flower Light Banner, Dhāraṇī Self-Mastery King, Jewel Seal Hand, Jewel Accumulation, Jewel Staff, and Transcending the Three Realms Bodhisattvas.

And there were the mighty bodhisattvas—Lion's Roar King, Lion Sport in the World, Lion's Swift Advance, Lion's Vigor, Brave and Sharp Power, Lion's Majestic Subduing—along with Vimalakīrti, Fragrant Elephant, Great Fragrant Elephant, Adornment, and Great Adornment Bodhisattvas. All these great bodhisattvas, eighty thousand of 'em gathered together.

Every last one of these bodhisattvas—they was masters of that Dharma-body, you hear? Accomplished in morality, accomplished in meditation, accomplished in wisdom. They had liberation, and they had the knowledge and vision of liberation. Their minds stayed peaceful, always restin' deep in samādhi—calm and tranquil, no tricks, no desire weighin' 'em down. Wrong views and confused thoughts couldn't get into 'em no more—no way, no how. They were still and clear, their aspirations profound and vast as space itself, unmoving for billions and billions of eons. Countless Dharma-doors appeared right before 'em, like doors openin' wide. They had great wisdom and penetrated all teachings, clearly seein' and distinguishin' the true characteristics and nature of things—existence and non-existence, long and short—all bright and plain as day.

They understood the capacities and desires of all beings, and with dhāraṇī and unobstructed eloquence, they requested the Buddha to turn the Dharma-wheel and could turn it themselves as His followers. Like the first drops of rain, they moistened the dust of desire, opened the gates of nirvana, fanned the winds of liberation, removed the world's burning afflictions, and brought the coolness of the Dharma.

Next they rained down the profound Twelve Links of Dependent Origination, washin' away the blazing sunlight of suffering—ignorance, old age, sickness, and death. Then they poured out that supreme Great Vehicle teaching like a mighty flood, moistening all beings' good roots, plantin' good seeds across the whole field of merit, makin' everybody sprout them bodhi-shoots. With the sun and moon of wisdom and the seasons of skillful means, they nourished and grew the great enterprise of the Great Vehicle, helpin' folks quickly achieve anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi—that supreme perfect enlightenment, you hear?—and dwell in eternal joy, subtle and true.

With immeasurable great compassion, they rescued suffering beings. They were the true good friends of all beings, the great fertile field of blessings for all beings, the teachers that nobody asked for but everybody needed, the safe and joyful refuge for all beings—the place of rescue, the place of protection, the great dwelling place. Everywhere they went, they were the great guides for the people.

They gave sight to the blind, gave hearin' to the deaf, gave noses to them without, gave tongues to the mute, made whole them whose faculties were damaged, brought right mind to the crazy and confused. They were the ship captain, the great ship captain, carryin' all beings across the river of birth and death to the shore of nirvana. They were the medicine king, the great medicine king, distinguishin' the characteristics of illness, understandin' the properties of medicine, givin' folks the right cure for their sickness so they'd take it gladly.

They were the trainer, the great trainer, free from all careless behavior, like someone who trains elephants and horses—able to tame what can't be tamed, fierce and brave as a lion subduin' all beasts, hard to break or destroy. They played freely in the bodhisattvas' perfections, stood firm and unshakeable on the Tathāgata ground, dwelt secure in their vow-power, extensively purified Buddha-lands, and were fixin' to soon achieve anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi. These great bodhisattvas all had inconceivable merits like this, yes indeed!

Now among them monks were: Great Wisdom Śāriputra, Spiritual Powers Maudgalyāyana, Wise Life Subhūti, Mahākātyāyana, Pūrṇa son of Maitrāyaṇī, Ājñāta-Kauṇḍinya, Heavenly Eye Aniruddha, Discipline-Keeper Upāli, Attendant Ānanda, Buddha's Son Rāhula, Upananda, Revata, Gavāṃpati, Bakkula, Acyuta, Svāgata, Mahākāśyapa the ascetic, Uruvilvā-Kāśyapa, Gayā-Kāśyapa, and Nadī-Kāśyapa. Twelve thousand monks like these, all of 'em arhats who'd exhausted their defilements, had no more bondage, and were truly and properly liberated.

Then Great Adornment Bodhisattva looked over the whole assembly, saw that everyone had settled their minds, and together with the eighty thousand great bodhisattvas, they rose from their seats and approached the Buddha. They bowed with their heads at His feet, circled Him a hundred thousand times, burned and scattered flowers, incense, robes, and jeweled necklaces—priceless treasures that came spinnin' down from the sky from all four directions as offerings to the Buddha. Heavenly kitchens and bowls overflowed with a hundred flavors—just seein' the colors and smellin' the fragrance made you naturally satisfied. Banners, flags, canopies, and wonderful musical instruments were placed everywhere. They made heavenly music to delight the Buddha.

Then they knelt down, put their palms together with one mind, and all together spoke this verse of praise:

> "Great, oh great, the Great Awakened, Great Holy Lord,
> Without stain, without defilement, without attachment,
> Trainer of gods and humans, elephants and horses,
> The wind of the Way, the fragrance of virtue, perfumin' everything.
>
> Wisdom tranquil, emotions calm, thoughts settled still,
> Intention ended, consciousness gone, mind also quiet,
> Forever cut off from false dreams and wandering thoughts,
> No more five aggregates, sense-realms, or entries.
>
> His body neither exists nor doesn't exist,
> Not caused, not conditioned, not self, not other,
> Not square, not round, not short, not long,
> Not appearing, not disappearing, not born, not dying—
> Beyond all forms!
>
> Not made, not arisen, not done, not created,
> Not sitting, not lying, not walking, not standing,
> Not moving, not turning, not busy, not still,
> Not advancing, not retreating, not safe, not in danger—
> Can't pin Him down!
>
> Neither right nor wrong, neither gain nor loss,
> Neither that nor this, neither going nor coming,
> Not blue, not yellow, not red, not white,
> Not crimson, not purple, none of them various colors—
> The Buddha's got no limits!
>
> Yet from precepts, meditation, wisdom, liberation, knowledge and vision arise,
> The three clarities and six spiritual powers and path-factors emerge,
> Compassion and the ten powers and fearlessness spring up,
> Brought forth by the good karma and conditions of living beings.
>
> He shows Himself as sixteen feet tall with purple-golden radiance,
> Square and upright, shinin' bright and clear,
> The mark between His brows like the moon, His neck like the sun's light,
> His hair in spirals of deep blue, the crown of His head raised high,
>
> His pure eyes shinin' clear, lookin' up and down,
> His eyebrows like indigo, stretched out, His face and cheeks square,
> His lips and tongue beautiful red like the vermillion fruit,
> His forty white teeth like pearl shells in the snow,
>
> His forehead broad, His nose high, His face open,
> On His chest the swastika mark, His breast like a lion's,
> His hands and feet soft, marked with thousand-spoked wheels,
> His armpits and palms joined smooth, perfect inside and out,
>
> His arms long, His elbows lengthy, His fingers straight and slender,
> His skin fine and soft, His body-hair curlin' to the right,
> His ankles and knees concealed, His male organ withdrawn like a horse's,
> Fine sinews and locked bones, calves like a deer's,
>
> Inside and out shinin' through, pure without stain,
> Pure water can't wet Him, dust can't touch Him.
> These thirty-two marks and such,
> And eighty minor characteristics seem visible,
>
> Yet really there's no mark, no mark-form,
> All forms that eyes could see are cut off,
> The markless mark has a marked body,
> And living beings' body-marks are the same way.
>
> He makes living beings joyfully bow down,
> With sincere hearts showin' respect, earnest and diligent,
> Through this, their pride and arrogance are removed,
> Accomplishin' such a wonderful form.
>
> We eighty thousand and all our companions,
> Together bow our heads and take refuge,
> In the One who's ended thoughts, mind, and consciousness,
> The trainer of elephants and horses, the unattached sage.
>
> We bow and take refuge in the Dharma-body,
> The gathering of precepts, meditation, wisdom, liberation, knowledge and vision.
> We bow and take refuge in the wonderful mark-adorned One,
> We bow and take refuge in the inconceivable One.
>
> His voice like Brahma's thunder soundin' in eight tones,
> Subtle, pure, profound, and far-reaching,
> The Four Truths, Six Perfections, Twelve Links,
> Turnin' accordin' to the minds and karma of living beings,
>
> Everyone who hears opens their mind and heart,
> Cuttin' off countless bonds of birth and death.
> Some hearin' attain stream-entry,
> Once-returning, non-returning, arhatship,
>
> The undefiled, unconditioned place of solitary awakening,
> The unborn, undying ground of bodhisattvas.
> Some attain countless dhāraṇīs,
> Unobstructed joyful eloquence and great skill in speech,
>
> proclaimin' profound and subtle verses,
> Sportin' and bathin' in the pure Dharma-pool.
> Some leap and fly, manifestin' spiritual powers,
> Emergin' from and enterin' water and fire, their bodies free,
>
> Such is the mark of this Dharma-wheel,
> Pure, limitless, inconceivable.
> We all together bow our heads again,
> Takin' refuge in the Dharma-wheel turned in its season.
>
> We bow and take refuge in the Brahma-voice,
> We bow and take refuge in conditions, truths, and perfections.
> The World-Honored One in past countless eons,
> Diligently and painfully cultivated all virtuous conduct,
>
> For us—humans, gods, dragons, and spirit-kings,
> And universally for all living beings.
> Able to give up all that's hard to give up,
> Wealth and treasures, wife and children, even kingdoms and cities,
>
> In the Dharma, inside and out, holdin' nothin' back,
> Even head, eyes, marrow, and brain all given to others.
>
> He upheld the pure precepts of all Buddhas,
> Never breakin' 'em even if it cost His life,
> Even when folks came at Him with weapons,
> With harsh words and insults, He never got angry.
>
> Through countless eons, pushin' His body without laziness,
> Day and night collectin' His mind, always in meditation,
> He learned all the various teachings and paths,
> His wisdom penetratin' deep into the roots of living beings.
>
> That's why now He's got that sovereign power,
> Sovereign in the Dharma as the Dharma King,
> We all together bow our heads,
> Takin' refuge in the One who endured all that's hard to endure."
