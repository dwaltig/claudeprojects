## PREFACE TO THE IMMEASURABLE MEANINGS SUTRA

*Written by Liu Qiu, that lonesome hermit from Jingzhou, back in the Xiao Qi days*

Now this here Immeasurable Meanings Sutra, it takes that One Formless Law and spreads it wide like gospel, birthin' all kinds of teachings, holdin' meanings you can't even count—that's why we call it "Immeasurable," you dig?

See, all them creatures in the three realms, they just keep on spinnin' 'round and 'round, followin' their karma like a old blues refrain. But that One Perfect Awakened One, He moves with the flow, respondin' to every soul that calls. Now them beings caught up in the wheel of birth and death, they're sufferin' somethin' terrible, hopin' for some joy—that's them knockin' on Heaven's door, that's their prayer, their cry. And when the Enlightened One shows up with His compassion and kindness, well, that's the answer to all them prayers, that's salvation comin' down the line.

Different folks got different needs, so the teachings come in seven stages, like seven verses of the cosmic blues:

First, He laid down the Five Precepts for folks like Bali and them—that's your basic human goodness, gettin' your soul right, stage one.

Second, He turned the wheel on the Four Noble Truths for Kauṇḍinya and his crew—that's the Teaching for the Voice Hearers, stage two.

Third, He broke down them Twelve Links of Dependent Origination for them middle-grade souls—that's the Path for the Solitary Realizers, stage three.

Fourth, He raised up the Six Perfections for them sharp ones—that's the Great Vehicle, the real deal, stage four.

Now once all them teachings had been preached and the questions were piling up, He came out with this Immeasurable Meanings Sutra—stage five. It talks about how folks get enlightened in different ways, but ain't yet revealed the whole truth, makin' folks hungry for the real thing, openin' the door to that Ultimate One.

Then the Lotus Sutra picks up the tune—stage six—proclaimin' that One Vehicle loud and clear, doin' away with them three separate paths, givin' folks what they been searchin' for, and droppin' them old expedient means.

But even after showin' the truth, He still held back on that eternal permanence teaching. It wasn't till He was layin' by them Twin Trees, 'bout to cross over, that He finally sang out that mysterious song about the pure, eternal Self—stage seven, the final chorus.

I'm just a humble soul, my mind bound up in confusion, and I ain't got the insight to grasp the depths of this sacred word. But I been lucky enough to meet some wise folks, and I've taken their words to heart.

Back in the Jian Yuan years, a monk named Huibiao from Mount Wudang—a man who walked the path of virtue and burned with the desire to spread the Word—he went travelin' to find the scriptures. He came to Guangzhou, to the Chaoting Temple, and met this master from India named Dharmāgatayaśas.

Now this master, he was fluent in the tongues of this land and that, and he walked the Bodhisattva path in his heart. They spent days together, side by side, and the master sang this sutra out for Huibiao to write down. Then Huibiao, he brought it back north, to this here place in Jingzhou.

In the third year of Yong Ming, on the eighteenth day of the ninth month, Huibiao showed me this scripture. I bowed down to it, felt a power I can't explain. I studied it day and night, couldn't put it down. It's been five or six years now, and finally, I'm startin' to catch the rhythm of it.

See, "Immeasurable Meanings"—that comes from the One Law. And that One Law? It's the nature of No-Self. From that nature of No-Self, all kinds of teachings flow—immeasurable, endless. That's why they call it Immeasurable Meanings.

It's deep, friends. Real deep. It's got the power to lift you up to the highest heights, to wash away all your troubles. It's like a king among scriptures, a diamond that cuts through everything.

If you can hear this song, if you can really hear it—even if you're just startin' out—you can leave behind all your suffering. You can find that peace you been lookin' for. It's a quick path, a direct line to the truth.

So I wrote this little preface, hopin' to share the good news. I know I ain't worthy, but I'm doin' it for the love of the Dharma, hopin' maybe, just maybe, it'll help somebody find their way home.

# CHAPTER ONE: VIRTUOUS CONDUCT

**Verse 1: The Gathering at Vulture Peak**

This is how I heard it, straight from the source.
One time, the Buddha was stayin' at the Royal City,
Up on Vulture Peak, high above the noise.
Twelve thousand monks were there with him,
And eighty thousand Bodhisattvas too.
Gods and dragons, spirits and kings,
All gathered 'round, just waitin' for the news.

**Verse 2: The Bodhisattvas' Style**

Now let me tell you 'bout them Bodhisattvas.
They wasn't ordinary folks, no sir.
They had that heavy virtue, solid as a rock.
They knew the Law, they knew the meaning,
They walked the talk, didn't just preach and scream.
Their minds were quiet, still as a deep river,
But their wisdom? It flowed like a mighty stream.

**Verse 3: The Great Adornment's Offering**

Then up rose a Bodhisattva named Great Adornment,
Lookin' fine, shine like the morning star.
With all his eighty thousand friends beside him,
He bowed down low, showed his respect from afar.
They brought flowers, incense, robes and jewels,
Piled 'em high like a mountain of grace.
And then they sang a song, a song of praise,
Fillin' up that whole holy place.

**Verse 4: Praise to the Holy One**

"Oh Lord, You're the Pure One, without a stain!
Your heart is free from all that worldly pain.
Your body shines with a thousand holy lights,
Like a golden mountain on the darkest nights.
You speak the truth, with a voice so sweet and clear,
Wipin' away every doubt and every fear.
You walked the path for aeons, long and hard,
To save us lost souls, scarred and marr'd.
We bow to You, Lord! We bow to You today!
Show us the light! Show us the Way!"

# CHAPTER TWO: PREACHING THE DHARMA

**Verse 1: The Big Question**

Then Great Adornment, he stepped up to the plate,
Said, "Lord, we got a question, and we can't wait.
These folks here, they want to know the score,
How to get to Heaven's gate and open up the door.
How to get enlightened, quick and fast and sure,
Without spendin' lifetimes sufferin' any more?"

**Verse 2: The Buddha's Answer**

The Buddha smiled, like the sun breakin' through the clouds.
He said, "Listen close, I'll tell you out loud.
There's a door to the Dharma, a special kind of gate,
It's called Immeasurable Meanings, and it's truly great.
If you practice this, you'll fly straight and true,
And Supreme Enlightenment will come to you."

**Verse 3: The Nature of the Law**

"Now, what is this Law? What's it all about?
It starts with looking inward, without a doubt.
Look at all things, from the sky to the ground,
See how they change, how they turn around.
Nothin' stays the same, not for a single day,
Everything arises, then it fades away.
It's like a dream, a bubble, a flash of light,
Here one moment, then gone from sight."

**Verse 4: Compassion's Call**

"When you see this truth, really see it deep,
A mighty compassion will wake from its sleep.
You'll see your brothers and sisters in their pain,
Caught in the storm, drowning in the rain.
And you'll say, 'I gotta help 'em! I gotta set 'em free!
I gotta share this treasure that was given to me!'"

**Verse 5: The One and the Many**

"From this one mind, this heart of pure love,
Immeasurable meanings descend from above.
Like a single seed growin' into a forest wide,
Or one little candle lightin' up the countryside.
The words may differ, the methods may vary,
But the truth is one, and it's extraordinary."

**Verse 6: The Water Parable**

"Think of water, washin' dirt away.
River water, well water, ocean spray.
It all gets you clean, no matter the source,
Just like my teachings run their course.
I preached the Agamas, I preached the Void,
I preached whatever the people enjoyed.
But now I'm preachin' the truth, straight and plain,
Immeasurable Meanings, like a healing rain."

# CHAPTER THREE: THE TEN POWERS OF MERIT

**Verse 1: The Power of the Book**

Then Great Adornment asked, "Lord, tell us true,
What kind of merit comes from what we do?
If we read this Sutra, if we pass it on,
What blessings will rise with the dawn?"

**Verse 2: The First Power - Changed Hearts**

"First off," said the Buddha, "it changes the heart.
Even a sinner can make a brand new start.
The greedy get generous, the angry get calm,
The fearful find courage, like a soothing balm.
Just hearin' these words can turn a life around,
Liftin' a lost soul up off the ground."

**Verse 3: The Second Power - Infinite Meaning**

"Second, if you grasp just a verse or a line,
Infinite meanings will begin to shine.
You'll understand the Law, the deep and the high,
Like an eagle soarin' in the boundless sky.
One truth becomes many, many become one,
A cycle of wisdom that's never done."

**Verse 4: The Third Power - Courage**

"Third, even if you're weary and burdened with care,
This Sutra gives you the strength to bear.
You might be sufferin', sick and alone,
But you'll preach the Dharma in a fearless tone.
You'll save others first, puttin' self aside,
With the light of the Sutra as your only guide."

**Verse 5: The Fourth Power - Royal Respect**

"Fourth, even if you haven't reached the goal,
This Sutra puts a crown upon your soul.
You'll be like a prince, born to the King,
Respected by sages and everything.
Though you're still learnin', still on the way,
You carry the truth that lights up the day."

**Verse 6: The Fifth Power - Connection**

"Fifth, holding this Sutra, you're never apart,
From the Buddhas past and present, heart to heart.
Though they seem distant, far across the space,
You'll hear their voices, feel their embrace.
You'll teach the Law just like they did of old,
Turning dust and gravel into purest gold."

**Verse 7: The Sixth Power - Freedom**

"Sixth, hearing this truth, you'll break every chain,
Leaving behind sorrow, leaving behind pain.
You'll realize the Law that sets the spirit free,
And walk the path of liberty."

**Verse 8: The Seventh Power - Transformation**

"Seventh, your presence becomes a holy thing,
Making the Dharma bells begin to ring.
Sinners will listen, skeptics will believe,
Because of the spirit that you receive.
You'll turn enemies into friends so dear,
Wiping away every trace of fear."

**Verse 9: The Eighth Power - Purification**

"Eighth, this Sutra washes karma clean,
Making you pure, serene, and keen.
Your past mistakes, they vanish like the dew,
Leaving a spirit that's fresh and new.
You'll gain the powers, the vision, the might,
Walking forever in the clear, pure light."

**Verse 10: The Ninth Power - Liberation**

"Ninth, you'll rise above all earthly ties,
Soaring like a bird in the open skies.
You'll cross the river of birth and death,
With freedom in every single breath.
You'll help others cross, a ferryman true,
Saving the many, not just the few."

**Verse 11: The Tenth Power - Buddha-Land**

"Tenth and final, you'll reach the stage,
Where wisdom flows like words on a page.
You'll manifest lands of pure delight,
Turning the darkness into radiant light.
You'll be a Buddha, full and complete,
With the universe bowing at your feet."

**Verse 12: The Closing**

When the Buddha finished, the earth shook and swayed,
Flowers rained down, a heavenly parade.
The assembly rejoiced, their hearts took flight,
Bathed in the glory of the Buddha's light.
They vowed to uphold this Sutra so grand,
Spreading its blessings throughout the land.
And that, my friends, is how the story ends,
With the Dharma as the truest of friends.
