# PREFACE TO THE IMMEASURABLE MEANINGS SUTRA
**(The Seven Stages of the Blues)**

*Written by Liu Qiu, that lonesome hermit from Jingzhou, back in the Xiao Qi days*

Now this here *Immeasurable Meanings Sutra*—it takes that **One Formless Law** and spreads it wide like gospel, birthin' all kinds of teachings, holdin' meanings you can't even count. That's why we call it "Immeasurable," you dig?

See, all them creatures in the Three Realms, they just keep on spinnin' 'round and 'round, followin' their karma like an old blues refrain. But that One Perfect Awakened One? He moves with the flow, respondin' to every soul that calls.
Now them beings caught up in the Wheel of Fire, they're sufferin' somethin' terrible. They're knockin' on Heaven's door. That's their prayer. That's their cry.
And when the Enlightened One shows up... that's the answer. That's salvation comin' down the line.

Different folks got different needs, so the teachings come in **Seven Stages**, like seven verses of the Cosmic Blues:

### The Seven Stages

1.  **Stage One (The Foundation):** First, He laid down the **Five Precepts** for folks like Bali. That's your basic human goodness. Gettin' your soul right.
2.  **Stage Two (Voice Hearers):** Then He turned the wheel on the **Four Noble Truths** for Kauṇḍinya and his crew.
3.  **Stage Three (Solitary Realizers):** He broke down them **Twelve Links of Dependent Origination** for the middle-grade souls.
4.  **Stage Four (The Great Vehicle):** He raised up the **Six Perfections** for them sharp ones. That's the real deal.
5.  **Stage Five (This Sutra):** Now, once all them teachings had been preached, He came out with this **Immeasurable Meanings Sutra**. It talks about how folks get enlightened in different ways, but *it ain't yet revealed the whole truth*. It makes folks hungry for the Real Thing. It opens the door.
6.  **Stage Six (The Lotus):** Then the *Lotus Sutra* picks up the tune—proclaimin' that **One Vehicle** loud and clear. Doin' away with them three separate paths.
7.  **Stage Seven (Nirvana):** But He still held back on that *Eternal Permanence* teaching until He was layin' by them Twin Trees. That's the final chorus. The Pure, Eternal Self.

### The Mystery of the Teaching

The Divine Way saves folks different ways dependin' on how they respond.
Out East, we call it the "Great One." Over West in Kashmir, they call it the "Correct Teaching."
Hopin' for emptiness and cultivatin' emptiness—they both get to the same place, you know what I'm sayin'?

There's folks who argue: "Do you get there **Gradual** (choppin' wood inch by inch) or **Sudden** (letting go of the ghost)?"
*   Master Zhi says: "The traces look different, but the insight's all one."
*   The Parables Chapter says: "Once the danger's passed, there ain't three ways no more."

So when this Sutra talks about "Gradual," that's just a finger pointin' at the moon.
Like tricking a child with an empty fist to get 'em out of a burning house.
But when you let go of the image and get the meaning... **Sudden Realization** makes more sense.

I'm just sketchin' the broad outline here. You listen to the music and decide for yourself.
