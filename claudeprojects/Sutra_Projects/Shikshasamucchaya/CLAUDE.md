# CLAUDE.md - Shikshasamucchaya Project

## Project Overview
This project involves the *Śikṣāsamuccaya* ("Compendium of Training") by Śāntideva (8th c. CE), a key Mahāyāna text compiling sutra quotations on ritual, discipline, and conduct. It is closely related to the *Bodhicaryāvatāra* and serves as its detailed textual foundation.
