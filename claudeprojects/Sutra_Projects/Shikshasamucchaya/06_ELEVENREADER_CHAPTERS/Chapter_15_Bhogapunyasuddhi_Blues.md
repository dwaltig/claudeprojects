# Chapter fifteen: The Sky (Bhogapuṇyaśuddhi)
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Blues Vernacular Translation by William Altig


The fifteenth chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on purifying your money and your merit—how to make a living without running a con, and how to give it all away like the sky raining on everybody.


# Part I: The Con Game (Purifying Goods)

## Don't Hustle the Hustle

We talked about purifying the Person. Now we gotta talk about the goods.
Why is this separate?
Because the bodhisattva don't accumulate. ¹
There ain't no pile of money sitting there. It moves.

But how do you get it?
Through Right Livelihood (samyagājīva).

The Ugra Sūtra lays it down:

"Listen, homeowner:
You seek your goods by the Dharma.
Not by the crooked way. By the straight way.
Fair. Not unfair.
You don't hustle the hustle. "

## The Five Ways to Run a Con (Kuhanā)

The Ratnamegha Sūtra² tells you exactly how NOT to act when you see a patron coming.
Don't be a hypocrite.

one. The Walk (Bodily Hypocrisy)
"When he sees a big donor coming,
he don't act all holy.
He don't walk slow. . . slow. . . like a turtle.
He don't look down at his feet like he's holding the world up.

He walks natural. He walks free.
He don't put on a show for the money. "

two. The Talk (Vocal Hypocrisy)
"He don't sweet-talk.
He don't get all soft and gentle just because there's a check involved.
He don't flatter.
He tells it straight. "

three. The Fake Humble (Mental Hypocrisy)
"Even when they offer him the world,
he acts like he don't want it.
But inside? He's burning for it.

'This is the internal fire, son:
Mouth says no, Mind says gimme. '

That's the con. "

four. The Hint (Nimitta)
"He don't drop hints:
'Oh, my robe is dragged out. . . '
'Man, this bowl is cracked. . . '
'I sure am sick, need some medicine. . . '

He don't beg without begging.
He don't use signs. "

five. The Interest Scheme
"He don't say:
'That guy over there? He gave me a gold watch.
Because he knows I'm holy. '

Trying to make the new guy jealous.
Trying to get interest on his reputation.
That ain't the way. "

You see?
No acting. No hints. No games.
If it comes, it comes. If it don't, it don't.
That's pure goods.


# Part II: The Sky-Like Man (Purifying Merit)

## Giving Like the Sky

Okay, you got the goods clean. Now how do you give 'em away?
How do you purify the merit?

The Gaganagañja Sūtra gives the root metaphor:
Be like the Sky (Gagana).

"He gives the gift purified of 'Me'.
Purified of 'Mine'.
Purified of 'I want a receipt'.
Purified of 'I hope I get to heaven'.

He gives a Sky-Like Gift.

Just as the Sky is boundless:
He gives with a boundless mind.

Just as the Sky covers everything:
He gives to everybody. No favorites.

Just as the Sky don't hold onto clouds:
He don't hold onto the gift.

Just as a Magician gives to a Magician:
Without thinking.
Without effort.
Without wondering if it's real.

He knows it's all a dream.
So he gives the dream-gift to the dream-man.
And he feels the Sky. "

## The Sky-Like Perfections

It ain't just giving. Everything gets the Sky treatment.

Sky-Like Morality
It's pure. Stainless.
It don't get puffed up. "I'm moral. "
It's calm like the blue yonder.

Sky-Like Patience
It's equal.
"Imagine a forest of trees.
Someone comes and cuts down one tree.
The other trees don't say:
'Oh, he got cut! We're safe! '
They don't hate the cutter.
They don't love the safety.
They just stand there.
That's Sky-Patience. "

Sky-Like Meditation
It's cool but it burns.
It's quiet but it works.
It's peaceful by nature, but it's busy saving the world.
It's the "Best of All Forms" (sarvākāra)—because it's empty of forms.


# Part III: Where the Bodhisattva Lives

## The Range

Where does this Sky-Man live?
The Vimalakīrti Sūtra tells you his range (gocara):

"Turning the Wheel of the Truth—that's his range.
Showing the Great Final Peace (Parinirvāṇa)—that's his range.
And never abandoning the world—that's his range.

He walks in the world.
He walks in the peace.
He walks in the Sky. "


Thus ends the Fifteenth Chapter: The Sky.
(Bhogapuṇyaśuddhi — Purification of Goods and Merit)


## Bluesman's Notes

one.  The Con Game: This chapter is all about checking your hustle. Are you "acting holy" to get paid? Are you dropping hints? Are you walking slow to look spiritual? That's the "Posturing" (kuhanā)—it's just a spiritual con. Cut it out.
two.  The Sky Metaphor: This is beautiful. Gagana (Sky) is the ultimate symbol of emptiness because it holds everything but sticks to nothing. A "Sky-Like Gift" asks for nothing back because the Sky doesn't need anything.
three.  The Trees: The image of the trees witnessing the cutting without judgment is powerful. That's true equanimity. Not indifference, just vastness.
