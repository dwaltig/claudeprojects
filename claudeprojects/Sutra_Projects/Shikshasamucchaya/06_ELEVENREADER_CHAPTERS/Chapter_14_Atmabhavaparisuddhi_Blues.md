# Chapter fourteen: The Empty House (Ātmabhāvapariśuddhi)
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Blues Vernacular Translation by William Altig


The fourteenth chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on purifying the person—realizing that this body is an empty house, the elements are visitors who don't pay rent, and the whole world is a dream you gotta wake up from.


# Part I: Cut the Root

## When the Root Is Cut, the Leaves Wither

You done the Four Posts. You stood guard. ¹
Now you gotta ask: Who are you guarding?

You gotta descend into the Empty Open Road (śūnyatā).
Why? To lift this world out of the ocean of suffering.

Because here's the truth:
If you think there's a "Person" standing there, the dirt (kleśas) keeps growing back.
You can chop the branches all day. But if the root is still there, the tree grows back.

The Tathāgataguhya Sūtra² says it plain:

"Listen, Śāntamati:
When the root of a tree is cut,
all the branches, leaves, and foliage wither.
Dry up. Gone.

Just so, Śāntamati:
When you quiet the view of 'This is My Body' (satkāyadṛṣṭi),
all the demons die down.
All the dirt dries up. "

You want to stop the sin?
Don't just scrubbing the surface.
Cut the root.


# Part II: The Praise of the Empty Man

## He Don't Tremble

What happens when you realize the house is empty?
The Moon-Lamp Sūtra³ sings the blues about it:

"He don't shake when he hears the Deep Teaching.
He don't tremble.
That hero don't fall under the sway of seduction.

He finds his joy in the Sugata's word—
The one who knows the nature of things is Peace.

Before long, he becomes the Boss Man (Buddha).
He becomes the Doctor, the Healer, the Giver of Joy.
He pulls the arrow out of those in pain.

He stands his ground like the Moon of Men.
They throw rocks? He don't get mad.
They hit him with sticks? He don't mind.
Even if they cut him limb from limb—
He don't get agitated.

Why?
Because he knows:
Nobody is being cut.
Nobody is hitting.
The house is empty. "


# Part III: Inspecting the Property (The Elements)

## Where Did It Come From? Where Does It Go?

You think this "Person" is real?
The Father-Son Meeting Sūtra⁴ breaks it down.

Here's the inventory of the property:
Six Elements (dhātu).
Six Windows (āyatana - senses).
Eighteen Ways the Mind Moves.

Let's look at the foundation.

### one. Earth (The Hard Stuff)
What's the Earth in you?
Hair, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, bone. The solid stuff.

Now ask yourself:
When that solidity arises, where did it come from?
Use your wisdom-eye. Look.
Did it come from the East? West?
No.

And when it ceases—when you die and turn to dust—
Where does it go? Does it pack a bag?
No.

Look at the embryo.
Man meets woman. Sperm meets blood.
But is the "Man" in the sperm? No.
Is the "Woman" in the blood? No.
It's just an intention arising from confusion.
Ideally unreal.

Ideally empty.
There ain't no "Earth-nature" in the earth.
It's just a name we give to hardness.

### two. Water (The Wet Stuff)
What's the Water in you?
Tears, sweat, spit, blood, piss, bile.

When you see your baby, tears flow.
When you lose your money, tears flow.
Where did that water come from? Was it hiding in your eyes like a reservoir?
No.

And when the body dries up in the grave?
Where did the water go?
Even the great oceans dry up at the end of the world.

Ideally empty.
Water ain't got no "Water-soul. " It's just wetness appearing.

### three. Fire (The Heat)
What's the Fire in you?
Digestion. Fever. The warmth of life.

It burns. It cooks your food.
But where does the fire hide when you're cold?
Nowhere.
It comes from conditions (fuel). It goes nowhere.
It exists after not existing. Then it disappears.

 Ideally empty.
No self-nature. Just heat doing its thing.

### four. Wind (The Motion)
What's the Wind in you?
Breath coming in. Breath going out.
Wind in the belly. Wind in the limbs.

Just like a storm rises, knocks down a tree, and vanishes.
Where did the storm go?
It didn't go home. It just stopped.

### five. Space (The Holes)
What's the Space in you?
Eye-sockets. Mouth. Throat. Entrails.
The gaps.

Listen: If a man digs a well in dry ground, he makes a hole.
Where did that "Space" come from?
Did he dig up the earth and find space underneath?
No. Space was there, just filled.

Space is empty.
Motionless. Immutable.
You can't hurt space. You can't burn space.
You are mostly space.

### six. Consciousness (The Knowing)
What's the Consciousness?
The eye sees a form, and you "know" it.

But does that knowing sit inside your eye like a little man looking out?
No.
Does it come from the object?
No.
Does it float in the air between them?
No.

It arises dependent on conditions.
Like fire from two sticks rubbing.
Ideally empty.


# Part IV: The Midnight Dream

## Waking Up in a Stranger's Bed

Here is the perfect teaching.
The senses are a magic show (māyā).
The objects are a dream (svapna).

"Listen, Great King:
A man is sleeping. He has a dream.
In the dream, he meets a beautiful woman.
A 'Country Beauty. '
He laughs with her. He plays with her. He loves her.

Then he wakes up.

Does that woman exist now?
No.
Did she exist in the dream?
No.

Now, if that man wakes up and starts crying:
'Where is my beautiful woman? I want her back! '
Is he a wise man?
No. He's a fool. "

You are that man.
You see forms with your eye. You cling to them.
"That's mine! I want that! "
You generate passion. You create karma.

But listen:
No dharma goes from this world to the next.
When you die, the Final Consciousness ceases.
The First Consciousness of the next life arises.
Like a flame passing from candle to candle.

Is it the same flame? No.
Is it a different flame? No.
It's the heat passing through conditions.

There is no Agent (kartā) here.
There is no Experiencer (bhoktā).
Nobody is driving the bus.
It's just the bus moving.


# Part V: The Truth About "Beings"

## The Lion's Roar

The Boss—the Lion of Men—he taught us two truths.

one.  Street Truth (Saṃvṛti): "Be decent. Be kind. Don't go to hell. Hell is hot. "
    He talked about hell-beings, ghosts, gods, and men.
    Why? To help us.

two.  Ultimate Truth (Paramārtha):
    "Ultimately, no 'being' is found. "

"The Lion of Men taught the street-talk
Speaking of the six roads,
But in the deep reality,
Nobody is walking the road. "


# Part VI: The Chariot

## Looking for the Driver

The Druma-Kinnara Sūtra⁵ lays it down with the Chariot:

"Look at the parts of the chariot.
Wheels. Axle. Yoke. Seat.
Where is the 'Chariot'?

Is it the wheels? No.
Is it the axle? No.
Is it the pile of parts? No.
Is it separate from them? No.

It's a designation. A name.
'Chariot. '

Just so, look at the Person.
Earth, Water, Fire, Wind.
Where is the 'Doer'?

The Doer is not found in the ten directions. "


# Part VII: How to Get Clean

## Don't Be Shaken

So how do you purify the person?
By realizing the person ain't there.

The Saṃgīti Sūtra gives the sign of the one who knows:

"He ain't shaken by worldly things.
Gain comes? He don't get high.
Loss comes? He don't get low.
Fame comes? He don't puff up.
Blame comes? He don't shrink.

Pleasure? Pain?
It's all same to him.

He who ain't shaken by the world—
He knows the Open Road. "

That's the purification (pariśuddhi).
Not scrubbing the skin.
Scrubbing the "Self" out of the mind.

That's The Empty House.
Nobody home.
Door open.
Wind blowing through.
Peace.


Thus ends the Fourteenth Chapter: The Empty House.
(Ātmabhāvapariśuddhi — Purification of the Person)


## Bluesman's Notes

one.  The Root: You can trim the branches of bad habits all day. But if you believe "I Am," the tree grows back. Wisdom cuts the root.
two.  The Elements: This ain't physics class. It's an inspection. Look at your body. Hard stuff? Earth. Wet stuff? Water. Warmth? Fire. Breath? Wind. Where is "You"? You're just the space these things move in.
three.  The Dream: This is the heart of the chapter. We are sleepwalking. We fall in love with dream-women and fight dream-battles. Waking up means realizing none of it was ever real.
four.  No Agent: This is the hardest pill. "Nobody is driving the bus. " Karma works, but there's no "Soul" carrying the bags. It's just the flow. Like a river.
