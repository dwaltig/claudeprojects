# Chapter thirteen: The Four Posts (Smṛtyupasthāna)
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Blues Vernacular Translation by William Altig


The thirteenth chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on the four foundations of mindfulness: mindfulness of body, feelings, mind, and dharmas. Includes teachings on contemplating impermanence, emptiness, and dependent origination.


# Standing Guard

You got your mind working now. ¹ You cleaned it out. You trained it in the Workshop.

Now you gotta stand guard. You gotta set up your posts.

Four posts. Four places to stand and watch.

This is smṛtyupasthāna—the Four Foundations of Mindfulness.

Let me show you where to stand.


# Part I: The First Post—Mindfulness of Body

## What Is This Body?

We already talked about the body in the Workshop—foulness meditation, the Butcher's Eye. ² Now we go deeper.

The Dharmasaṃgīti Sūtra says: ³

A bodhisattva establishes mindfulness in the body like this:

"This body is a collection of feet-toes-shins-thighs-belly-navel-back-spine-heart-ribs-hands-arms-shoulders-neck-jaw-forehead-skull-head. Accumulated by karma, inhabited by a hundred thousand thought-constructions and afflictions.

And in this body, many substances are assembled: hair, body-hair, nails, teeth, bones, skin, flesh, fat, sinews, marrow, liver, lungs, intestines, urine, feces, bile, phlegm, pus, mucus, brain.

So many substances assembled here. What is this body? "

When you examine it like that, you see:

"This body is like space. "

He establishes mindfulness in the body as space. Sees all this as space.

Then, because he knows the body, his mindfulness doesn't wander. Doesn't scatter. Doesn't run away.


## The Body Has No Owner

The Sūtra continues:

"This body did not come from the past. It does not transmigrate to the future. It does not stand between past and future. It arises from false imaginings. It has no maker, no experiencer. It is not established at beginning, middle, or end.

It has no owner. Nothing is 'mine. ' Nothing is grasped.

It is spoken of by visitors as 'body,' 'form,' 'enjoyment,' 'support,' 'corpse,' 'sense-sphere. '

This body is essenceless. Born from mother's blood and father's semen. Impure by nature, putrid, foul-smelling. Full of desire, hatred, delusion, fear, depression, thievishness. Always subject to death, falling, breaking, scattering, destruction. Led by a hundred thousand diseases. "

You hear that?

No owner. No landlord. No "I" running it.

Just conditions meeting. Just blood and semen. Just impurity, decay, and death.


## Three Essences from an Impermanent Body

The Ratnacūḍa Sūtra says: ⁴

"Knowing this body is impermanent, unstable, ending in death, he does not live dangerously for the sake of the body. But he takes the essence.

He takes three essences: body-essence, wealth-essence, life-essence.

Body-essence: Knowing 'the body is impermanent,' he undertakes servanthood and discipleship toward all beings, eager to serve.

He does not commit body-faults, deceit, hypocrisy, concealment, trickery.

Life-essence: Knowing 'the body is impermanent,' having obtained the relief of life, he does not do evil karma even for the sake of life.

Wealth-essence: Knowing 'the body is impermanent,' he does not settle into craving for enjoyments. He becomes like one who has abandoned everything. "

You understand?

The body is impermanent, unstable, ending in death.

So you don't live dangerously for it. You don't cheat, deceive, or trick for it.

You take the essence. You use the body to serve beings. You don't do evil for life. You don't crave wealth.

That's body-essence. That's the essence you extract from an impermanent body.


## Establishing All Bodies in Buddha-Body

The Ratnacūḍa continues:

"A bodhisattva, cultivating mindfulness-of-body contemplation, binds all beings' bodies to his own body. And this is his thought:

'All beings' bodies should be established by me in Buddha-body. '

And as there are no outflows in the Tathāgata's body, so he contemplates the dharma-nature of his own body. He becomes skillful in the dharma-nature of no-outflows, and he knows all beings' bodies to have that very characteristic. "

You see what he's doing?

He's not just contemplating his own body. He's binding all beings' bodies to his body.

"All beings' bodies should be established by me in Buddha-body. "

That's the bodhisattva's body-contemplation. Not just cleaning your own body. Establishing all bodies in Buddha-body.


## Sixty-One Body-Metaphors

The Vīradattaparipṛcchā gives sixty-one metaphors for this body: ⁵

Listen to this list. Every image cuts:

This body is:

Gradually arisen, gradually destroyed, a heap of atoms
Full of holes, bowing and rising
Streaming from nine wound-openings, like an anthill housing serpents
An unconquered enemy
A monkey-faced friend—betrays like a false friend
Like a bad friend—speaks falsely by nature
Like a foam-ball—weak by nature
Like water-bubbles—arisen, broken, dissolved
Like a mirage—deceptive by nature
Like a banana tree—when examined, essenceless
Like an illusion—by nature deceitful
Like a king—full of commands
Like an enemy—always watching for openings
Like a thief—not to be trusted
Like a condemned man—followed by the executioner
Like an enemy—wishing harm
Like a killer—obstructing wisdom-life
Like an empty village—devoid of self
Like a potter's vessel—ending in breakage
Like a latrine—full of various impurities
Like a pot of fat—streaming with impurities
Like a wound—unable to bear rubbing
Like a thorn—torturing by nature
Like an old house—requiring repair
Like old vehicles and vessels—requiring repair
Like a raw pot—requiring protection with effort
Like a riverbank tree—unstable, moving
Like a great river-current—ending in death-ocean
Like a traveler's inn—dwelling-place of all suffering
Like an orphanage—unprotected
Like a marketplace—obtained by bribes
Like a child—constantly requiring protection

You got sixty-one images. Every one showing the body's nature.

Unstable. Impermanent. Full of holes. Betraying. Deceitful. Requiring protection. Ending in death.

That's body-mindfulness. That's the First Post.


## The Body Verses

The Vīradattaparipṛcchā concludes with verses:

One who considers this body—a heap of filth—as beautiful,
that fool of limited understanding goes carrying a pot of shit, senseless.

The nose carries a rampart of pus, the mouth always carries foul smell,
and like worms in the eyes of beings—who has desire or pride in that?

Just as a fool, taking a coal, rubs it thinking "This will become white"—
it goes to destruction, not to whiteness—the fool's mind has false pride.

So whoever thinks "I'll make this filthy body pure"—
bathed in a hundred pilgrimage waters, rubbed with unguents—
it goes to destruction by death's power, not to purity.

You hear that?

You can't make the body pure. You can bathe it in a hundred holy rivers. You can rub it with perfumes.

It goes to destruction, not to purity.

That's the body. That's the First Post. Keep watching it.


# Part II: The Second Post—Mindfulness of Feelings

## Three Feelings, Three Compassions

The Ratnacūḍa Sūtra teaches: ⁶

"A bodhisattva, cultivating mindfulness of feelings, obtains great compassion for beings attached to pleasant feeling. And he trains thus:

'That pleasure where no feeling exists—that's where there's no suffering. '

He cultivates mindfulness of feelings for the cessation of beings' feeling. He straps on armor for beings' feeling-cessation. But he doesn't make feeling-cessation himself.

Whatever feeling he feels, he feels it all embraced by great compassion. "

Listen to how this works:

### When Pleasant Feeling Arises

"When he feels pleasant feeling, he obtains great compassion for beings of desire-nature, and abandons the tendency to attachment in himself. "

Pleasant feeling comes. He doesn't grasp it. He doesn't get pulled by it.

But he feels compassion for all the beings grasping at pleasure. Pulled by the tendency to attachment.

### When Painful Feeling Arises

"When he feels painful feeling, he obtains great compassion for beings of hatred-nature, and abandons the tendency to aversion in himself. "

Painful feeling comes. He doesn't push it away. He doesn't hate it.

But he feels compassion for all the beings pushing away pain. Pulled by the tendency to aversion.

### When Neither-Pleasant-Nor-Painful Feeling Arises

"When he feels neither-pleasant-nor-painful feeling, he obtains great compassion for beings of delusion-nature, and abandons the tendency to ignorance in himself. "

Neutral feeling comes. He doesn't space out. He doesn't get confused.

But he feels compassion for all the beings confused by neutral feeling. Pulled by the tendency to ignorance.


## The Three Abandonings

The Sūtra continues:

"In pleasant feeling, he is not drawn in—but he uproots attachment.

In painful feeling, he is not struck down—but he uproots aversion.

In neither-pleasant-nor-painful feeling, he does not become ignorant—but he uproots ignorance. "

You understand?

Three feelings. Three compassions. Three uprooting.

Feel pleasure? Compassion for the attached. Uproot attachment.
Feel pain? Compassion for the averse. Uproot aversion.
Feel neutral? Compassion for the deluded. Uproot ignorance.


## Three Knowledges

"Whatever feeling he knows, he knows it all as impermanent feeling, as suffering feeling, as non-self feeling.

In pleasant feeling, he is a knower of impermanence.
In painful feeling, he is a knower of the thorn (painful feeling is like a thorn).
In neither-pleasant-nor-painful feeling, he is a knower of peace.

Thus:
What is pleasant is impermanent.
What is painful is suffering.
What is neither-pleasant-nor-painful is non-self. "

Three feelings. Three knowledges.

Pleasant = impermanent
Painful = thorn (suffering)
Neutral = peace (non-self)


## Feeling Is Not the Feeler

The Akṣayamati Sūtra teaches: ⁷

"Touched by painful feeling, he generates great compassion for beings fallen into all painful states. . .

But truly, fixation is feeling, grasping is feeling, clinging is feeling, perceiving is feeling, distortion is feeling, conceptualization is feeling. "

The Dharmasaṃgīti Sūtra says: ⁸

Feeling is spoken of as experience. By what is it experienced?
The feeler is not separate from feeling. It does not exist apart.

Thus mindfulness should be established in feeling by the wise,
Just as in awakening—peaceful, pure, luminous.

You hear that?

There's no feeler separate from feeling.

Feeling arises. But there's no "I" experiencing the feeling.

Just feeling. Just arising. Just ceasing.

That's the Second Post. Mindfulness of Feelings.


# Part III: The Third Post—Mindfulness of Mind

## Where Is This Mind?

The Ratnacūḍa Sūtra: ⁹

A bodhisattva searches for mind like this:

"Which mind? Does it get attached? Does it get angry? Does it get deluded? Is it past, future, present? "

He searches:

"What is past is destroyed.
What is future has not arrived.
What is present has no stability.

Mind, O Kāśyapa, is not found inside, not outside, not between both.

Mind has not been seen by all Buddhas, is not seen, will not be seen.

What all Buddhas have not seen, do not see, will not see—what kind of behavior can be seen in that?

Only by false, mistaken perception do dharmas proceed.

Mind is like an illusion—by false imagination it takes on various rebirths. "

You understand?

The mind can't be found.

Not inside. Not outside. Not in between.
Not past. Not future. Not present.

All Buddhas never saw mind. Never see mind. Never will see mind.

If Buddhas can't see it, what is there to see?

Only false imagination. Only illusion.


## Twenty-One Mind-Metaphors

The Ratnacūḍa continues with metaphors:

Mind is like a river-current—unstable, arisen-broken-dissolved.

Mind is like a lamp-flame—proceeding by causes and conditions.

Mind is like lightning—momentary-breaking, unstable.

Mind is like space—afflicted by adventitious defilements.

Mind is like an evil friend—generating all suffering.

Mind is like a fish-hook—perception of pleasure in pain.

Mind is like a blue fly—perception of purity in impurity.

Mind is like an enemy—acting in various harmful ways.

Mind is like a life-stealing yakṣa—always searching for openings.

Mind is like a thief—stealing all wholesome roots.

Mind delighting in form is like a moth's eye (drawn to flame).

Mind delighting in sound is like a war-drum.

Mind delighting in smell is like a pig in filth.

Mind delighting in taste is like a servant who only eats leftovers.

Mind delighting in touch is like a fly in an oil-pot.

You got twenty-one metaphors for mind.

River-current. Lamp-flame. Lightning. Space. Evil friend. Fish-hook. Blue fly. Enemy. Yakṣa. Thief.

Moth-eye for forms. War-drum for sounds. Pig for smells. Leftover-eater for tastes. Fly in oil for touch.

Every metaphor showing mind's nature—unstable, deceptive, harmful, grasping.


## Mind Cannot Be Found

The Sūtra concludes:

"Mind, when searched for, is not obtained. What is not obtained is not perceived. What is not perceived is neither past, future, nor present.

What is neither past, future, nor present has transcended the three times.

What has transcended the three times—there, 'it exists' and 'it does not exist' don't apply. "

You search for mind?

You won't find it.

You don't find it? You don't perceive it.

You don't perceive it? It's not in the three times.

Not in the three times? It transcends past, future, present.

Transcends the three times? "Exists" and "doesn't exist" don't apply.

That's mind-nature. Empty. Unfindable. Beyond existence and non-existence.


## Mind Cannot See Itself

The Ratnacūḍa adds: ¹⁰

"He searches for mind but doesn't see mind inside, doesn't see mind outside, doesn't see mind in the aggregates, elements, or sense-spheres.

Not seeing mind, he searches for mind's stream: 'Where does mind arise? '

It occurs to him: 'When there's an object, mind arises. '

But what is that object? Is the object different from mind? Or is the object identical with mind?

If the object is different from mind, there would be two minds. But if the object is identical with mind, how can mind see mind?

Mind cannot see mind.

Just as: the same sword-edge cannot cut that same sword-edge. The same fingertip cannot touch that same fingertip. So mind cannot see that same mind. "

You hear that logic?

Mind needs an object to arise. But what's the object?

If the object is different from mind, you got two minds.
If the object is the same as mind, mind would have to see mind.

But mind can't see mind.

Like a sword can't cut itself. Like a fingertip can't touch itself.

Mind can't see itself.


## One-Pointedness of Mind

The Ratnacūḍa concludes:

"The stability, the one-pointedness, the non-scattering, the non-wandering, the calm one-pointedness of this far-going, unembodied, lightly-turning, sense-object-rolling, six-sense-sphere-ranging, ever-changing mind that is like a troubled, disturbed, unstable monkey, like the wind—

This is called mindfulness of mind. "

You got this wild mind. Monkey-mind. Wind-mind. Troubled. Disturbed. Far-going. Rolling through sense-objects.

You establish it. You make it stable. One-pointed. Not scattering. Not wandering.

That's mindfulness of mind. That's the Third Post.


# Part IV: The Fourth Post—Mindfulness of Dharmas

## No Dharma to Be Found

The Ratnacūḍa teaches: ¹¹

"Dwelling in dharmas, observing dharmas, a bodhisattva does not see any dharma. He does not see dharma as Buddha-dharma. He does not see dharma as awakening. He does not see dharma as path. He does not see dharma as escape.

Knowing all dharmas as escapeless, he enters the samādhi called 'No Obstruction,' born from great compassion.

He obtains artificial perception regarding all dharmas and all afflictions:

'These dharmas are unafflicted. These are not defilements. '

Why? Because they proceed to ultimate meaning. There is no accumulation of afflictions, no heap of them. No attachment-nature, no aversion-nature, no delusion-nature.

By awakening to these very afflictions, there is awakening.
The afflictions' own-nature is awakening's own-nature.

Thus he establishes mindfulness. "

You hear that radical teaching?

The afflictions' own-nature is awakening's own-nature.

By awakening to the afflictions, there's awakening.

Afflictions and awakening—same nature.


## Dharmas Arise and Cease—No Self Inside

The Ratnacūḍa continues:

"A bodhisattva dwelling with mindfulness of dharmas observing dharmas thinks thus:

'Dharmas arising, arise. Dharmas ceasing, cease.

But there is no self-existence here, no being, no life, no creature, no nourisher, no person, no human who is born, ages, dies, falls, or arises.

This is the dharma-nature of dharmas.

If they are gathered together, they come together. If they are not gathered together, they do not come together. Wholesome, unwholesome, or immovable—whatever type they are gathered as, that type they come together as.

There is no gatherer of dharmas. There is no arising of causeless dharmas. '"

You understand?

Dharmas arise when conditions meet. Dharmas cease when conditions separate.

But there's no "I" making them arise. There's no "I" making them cease.

Just conditions. Just gathering. Just scattering.

No gatherer. No agent. No self running the show.


## Never Abandoning Bodhicitta

The Ratnacūḍa adds:

"Even while contemplating profound dharmas, he does not abandon mindfulness of bodhicitta, of omniscience. "

You contemplate emptiness? You see no-self? You see dharmas as empty?

Don't abandon bodhicitta. Don't let go of the Waking-Up Heart.

That's the key. Emptiness with bodhicitta.

Not just emptiness cutting beings loose. Emptiness holding all beings.


# Part V: The Lalitavistara Verses—Dependent Origination

## Sixteen Verses on How Things Arise

The Lalitavistara Sūtra gives verses on the nature of conditioned things (saṃskāras): ¹²

Listen to these sixteen verses. Every one a teaching:

### Verse one: Impermanence

Conditioned things are impermanent, unstable, like raw pots—breaking by nature.
Borrowed, like begged things, like a sand-city—temporary.

### Verse two: Falling Apart

Conditioned things have falling-apart nature, like plaster in the rainy season,
like a riverbank with sand—dependent on conditions, weak by nature.

### Verse three: Arising and Ceasing

Conditioned things are like lamp-flames—quick arising-ceasing nature,
unstable, like wind, weak, essenceless like foam-balls.

### Verse four: Empty

Conditioned things are without agency, empty, like banana-trunks to one who examines.
Illusion-like, mind-deluding, like fooling children, like empty fists.

### Verse five: Dependent Origination

By causes and by conditions, all conditioned-things-movement proceeds.
Depending on each other from causes—this fools don't understand.

### Verse six: The Rope Example

Just as muñja-grass depends on valbaja-grass, rope is twisted by effort's power.
A well-wheel with buckets turns—in each one individually there is no turning.

Explanation: Like two grasses leaning on each other. Like a rope twisted from strands. Like a well-wheel turning—each part depends on the others. None of them turning by themselves.

### Verse seven: The Becoming-Wheel

So the whole becoming-wheel turns, supported by mutual arising.
In each one individually there is no turning—not found in past or future end.

You hear that? The wheel of becoming turns. But each part individually doesn't turn.

It's mutual arising. Leaning on each other. Supporting each other.

No individual mover. No "I" running the wheel.

### Verse eight: Seed and Sprout

Just as when there's a seed, a sprout—but what is seed is not sprout,
nor is it other than that, nor is it that—thus uncut, non-eternal, dharma-nature.

Seed becomes sprout. But seed is not sprout. Sprout is not seed.

Yet they're not completely different either.

That's the middle way. Not cut off. Not eternal. Arising without "sameness" or "difference. "

### Verse nine: Conditions Are Empty

Conditioned things have ignorance as condition. But those conditioned things don't truly exist.
Conditioned things and ignorance both—these are empty, without agency by nature.

Ignorance causes conditioned things. But ignorance itself is empty. And conditioned things are empty.

Empty causes. Empty effects. No agent anywhere.

### Verse ten: Seal and Impression

From a seal, an impression is seen. The seal's transference is not perceived.
Not in it, nor outside, nor in both—thus conditioned things: non-cut, non-eternal.

Like a seal stamping wax. You see the impression. But you don't see "seal-substance" transferring.

The form appears. But nothing transfers. Nothing moves across.

That's how conditioned things arise. Appearance without transference. Effect without substance moving.

### Verse eleven: Eye and Form

Eye and form depending—eye-consciousness arises here.
Form is not based in eye. Form's transference is not into eye.

Eye meets form. Consciousness arises.

But form doesn't live in the eye. And form doesn't transfer into the eye.

Just: conditions meet, consciousness arises.

### Verse twelve: False Constructions

No-self and foul by dharma-nature—yet they're constructed as self and pure.
By false, mistaken construction, eye-consciousness arises from that.

Reality is no-self and foul. But we construct it as self and pure.

From false construction, consciousness arises.


### Verse thirteen: Fire from Sticks

Just as from a fire-stick and upper stick, hand-effort meeting three ways,
from conditions, fire is born—having done its work, it quickly ceases.

Rub two sticks. Fire arises. Fire does its work. Fire goes out.

Now if someone asks: Where did that fire come from? Where is it going?
Searching all directions and places—no going is found, no non-going found.

Where does the fire come from? Nowhere.
Where does it go? Nowhere.

Just conditions meeting. Fire arising. Fire ceasing.

No coming. No going. Just arising and ceasing from conditions.

### Verse fourteen: No Being to Be Found

Aggregates, sense-spheres, elements, craving, ignorance—these are karma-conditions.
Their assembly suggests "being. " But in ultimate truth, it's not obtained.

Five aggregates. Twelve sense-spheres. Eighteen elements. Craving. Ignorance.

These suggest "being. " These point to a person.

But in ultimate truth? No being is found.

Just conditions. Just assembly. No person running it.

### Verse fifteen: Sound from Conditions

Throat, lips, palate depending, tongue turning, syllables arise.
Not found in throat, not in palate—each syllable individually not obtained.

Sound arises from throat, lips, tongue meeting.

But sound doesn't live in the throat. Sound doesn't live in the tongue.

And each syllable by itself? Not obtained.

From assembly, depending, by mind and understanding's power, speech proceeds.
Mind and speech, invisible-formed, not found outside or inside.

Mind and speech—invisible form.

Not outside. Not inside.

Just: conditions meet, speech arises.

### Verse sixteen: The Lute Example

Just as lute depends on wood, hand-effort meeting three ways,
with resonance-box, vīṇā, good sound-instruments—sound proceeds, born from that.

Now if a wise one asks: Where did that sound come from? Where is it going?
Searching all directions and places—sound's going and coming are not obtained.

Same as the fire example.

Lute-body. Strings. Fingers. They meet. Sound arises.

Where does sound come from? Nowhere.
Where does it go? Nowhere.

Just conditions meeting. Sound arising. Sound ceasing.

### Verse seventeen: The Yogi Sees Emptiness

Thus by causes and by conditions, all conditioned-things-movement proceeds.
But the yogi, by seeing reality, sees conditioned things as empty, without agency.

Causes and conditions make everything turn.

But the yogi sees through it. Sees it all as empty. Sees it all without agency.

No "I" making it happen. No self running the show.

Just conditions. Just arising. Just ceasing.

### Verse eighteen: All Dharmas Are Space

Aggregates, sense-spheres, elements—empty inside, empty outside,
devoid of being-soul-dwelling, characterized by dharma-space nature.

Aggregates, sense-spheres, elements—all empty.

Empty inside. Empty outside.

No being. No soul. No dwelling-place.

Their nature is space. Open. Empty. Without substance.

That's dependent origination. That's how things arise. That's the Fourth Post.


# Part VI: Names Are Empty

## The Lokanāthavyākaraṇa Verses

The Lokanāthavyākaraṇa Sūtra concludes: ¹³

Dharmas are empty, nameless—what name do you ask about?
Emptiness has no gods, no nāgas, no rākṣasas,
no humans, no non-humans—all that exists is name.

By name, the name-ness is empty. In name, no name is found.
All dharmas are nameless, but illuminated by names.

The own-nature of name has never been seen, never been heard,
never arisen, never ceased—whose name do you ask about here?

Name is conventional usage. Name is a designation shown.
Ratnacitra by name, Ratnottama supreme.

You understand?

Dharmas are empty. Names are empty.

You call something "Ratnacitra. " You call something "Ratnottama. "

But in the name itself, no name is found.

The name points. The name designates. But the name-nature is empty.

All dharmas are nameless. But we illuminate them by names.

That's the emptiness of names. That's the Fourth Post.


Thus ends the Thirteenth Chapter: The Four Posts.


## Endnotes

¹ Chapter connection: After mind-training (cittaparikarma, Ch twelve) and purification (pāpaśodhana, Ch eight), now establish the four foundations of mindfulness (smṛtyupasthāna).

² Body contemplation: Already covered in Chapter twelve via aśubhā bhāvanā (foulness meditation), the Butcher's Eye, and thirty-two body parts. Chapter thirteen deepens this with no-self contemplation.

³ Dharmasaṃgīti Sūtra: Body as collection of parts, substances (hair, nails, bones, flesh, fat, and so on), ultimately like space—no owner, no "mine. "

⁴ Ratnacūḍa Sūtra: Three essences from impermanent body—body-essence (serve beings), life-essence (don't do evil for life), wealth-essence (don't crave). Bodhisattva binds all beings' bodies to his own, establishing them in Buddha-body.

⁵ Vīradattaparipṛcchā: sixty-one body-metaphors (anthill housing serpents, unconquered enemy, monkey-faced friend, foam-ball, water-bubbles, mirage, banana tree, illusion, king, enemy, thief, condemned man, killer, empty village, potter's vessel, latrine, fat-pot, wound, thorn, old house, old vehicles, raw pot, riverbank tree, river-current, traveler's inn, orphanage, marketplace, child). Body can't be made pure—bathed in hundred pilgrimage waters, goes to destruction not purity.

⁶ Ratnacūḍa on feeling: Three feelings generate three compassions—pleasant feeling/desire-nature/uproot attachment, painful feeling/hatred-nature/uproot aversion, neutral feeling/delusion-nature/uproot ignorance. Three knowledges: pleasant=impermanent, painful=thorn, neutral=peace/non-self.

⁷ Akṣayamati Sūtra: Painful feeling generates compassion. Fixation/grasping/clinging/perceiving/distortion/conceptualization are all feeling.

⁸ Dharmasaṃgīti on feeling: No feeler separate from feeling. Mindfulness of feeling same as awakening—peaceful, pure, luminous.

⁹ Ratnacūḍa on mind: Mind unfindable—not inside, outside, or between; not past, future, present; never seen by Buddhas; like illusion, river-current, lamp-flame, lightning, space, evil friend, fish-hook, blue fly, enemy, yakṣa, thief. Mind delighting in five sense-objects like moth-eye, war-drum, pig, leftover-eater, fly in oil.

¹⁰ Mind cannot see itself: Like sword-edge can't cut itself, fingertip can't touch itself. When object exists, mind arises—but if object same as mind, mind would see mind (impossible); if object different from mind, two minds (absurd). One-pointedness of wild monkey-wind mind is mindfulness of mind.

¹¹ Ratnacūḍa on dharmas: No dharma found as Buddha-dharma, awakening, path, or escape. Afflictions unafflicted by nature—by awakening to afflictions, there's awakening; afflictions' own-nature is awakening's own-nature. Dharmas arise and cease with no self inside—no gatherer, no arising of causeless dharmas. Never abandon bodhicitta even while contemplating profound dharmas.

¹² Lalitavistara verses: Sixteen verses on dependent origination—conditioned things impermanent (raw pots, borrowed things, sand-city), falling apart (rainy season plaster, riverbank), quick arising-ceasing (lamp-flame, wind, foam), empty (banana trunk, illusion, empty fist). By causes/conditions all proceeds—muñja-valbaja grass, rope twisted, well-wheel turning (no individual turning). Seed-sprout (not same, not different, uncut, non-eternal). Ignorance-conditions empty. Seal-impression (no transference). Eye-form (no transference into eye). Fire from sticks, sound from throat-lips-tongue, lute-sound (where from? where to? nowhere). Yogi sees emptiness. Aggregates/sense-spheres/elements empty inside-outside, dharma-space nature.

¹³ Lokanāthavyākaraṇa: Dharmas empty, nameless—name-ness empty, in name no name found. Name's own-nature never seen/heard/arisen/ceased. Names are conventional usage, designations.


## Theological Notes

### The Four Foundations of Mindfulness

This chapter covers the four smṛtyupasthānas (foundations of mindfulness):

one. Kāyasmṛtyupasthāna (Body): Body as space, no owner, impermanent, sixty-one metaphors showing decay/suffering
two. Vedanāsmṛtyupasthāna (Feeling): Three feelings generate three compassions, three uprooting, three knowledges
three. Cittasmṛtyupasthāna (Mind): Mind unfindable, twenty-one metaphors, can't see itself, wild monkey-wind needing one-pointedness
four. Dharmasmṛtyupasthāna (Dharmas): No dharma found, afflictions' nature is awakening's nature, dependent origination

These are the four posts where mindfulness is established—four places to stand guard and watch.


### Bodhisattva's Unique Contemplations

Unlike Śrāvaka contemplation (focused on one's own liberation), bodhisattva contemplation includes:

one. Body: Binding all beings' bodies to own body, establishing all in Buddha-body
two. Feeling: Three feelings generate three compassions for beings of three natures
three. Mind: Contemplating mind's emptiness while never abandoning bodhicitta
four. Dharmas: Seeing afflictions' nature as awakening's nature

Key principle: Emptiness contemplation with bodhicitta, not abandoning beings.


### Afflictions Are Awakening

The radical teaching from Ratnacūḍa:

"By awakening to these very afflictions, there is awakening. The afflictions' own-nature is awakening's own-nature. "

This is not saying "stay afflicted" or "don't purify. "

This is saying: The nature of afflictions is empty—same as the nature of awakening.

When you awaken to the afflictions' empty nature, that very awakening-to-afflictions is awakening.

Not two natures. One nature—emptiness.


### Dependent Origination—The Lalitavistara Teaching

Sixteen verses systematically showing:

one. Impermanence: Raw pots breaking, rainy-season plaster falling, lamp-flame arising-ceasing
two. Emptiness: Banana trunk essenceless, illusion, empty fist
three. Dependent arising: Muñja-valbaja grass leaning on each other, rope twisted, well-wheel turning
four. No individual agent: In each part, no turning found individually
five. Not-same, not-different: Seed-sprout example—not identical, not completely other
six. No transference: Seal-impression (form appears, nothing moves), eye-form (no form entering eye)
seven. Arising from conditions: Fire from sticks, sound from lute—where from? nowhere; where to? nowhere

The point: Everything arises from conditions meeting. Nothing has independent existence. No agent making it happen.

Just conditions. Just arising. Just ceasing.


### The Four Posts Metaphor

This chapter's root metaphor: The Four Posts—four places to stand and establish mindfulness.

one. Body-Post: Stand and watch the body—impermanent, essenceless, no owner
two. Feeling-Post: Stand and watch feelings—three feelings, three compassions, three uprooting
three. Mind-Post: Stand and watch mind—unfindable, like wind, needing one-pointedness
four. Dharma-Post: Stand and watch dharmas—arising and ceasing, no self inside, afflictions' nature is awakening's nature

Four posts. Four places to stand guard. Four ways to establish mindfulness.

Guard them all. Don't let mindfulness wander.
