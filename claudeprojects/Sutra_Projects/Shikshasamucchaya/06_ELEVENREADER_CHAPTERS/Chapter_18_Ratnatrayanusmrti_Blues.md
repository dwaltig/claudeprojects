# Chapter eighteen: The Three on Repeat (Ratnatrayānusmṛti)
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Blues Vernacular Translation by William Altig


The eighteenth chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on remembering the Three Jewels—keeping Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha playing on repeat in your mind like a song you can't stop humming.


# Part I: The Foundation (Four Dharmas)

## What Keeps You From Falling Back

We talked about increasing your merit. ¹ Now we gotta talk about remembering.

Why remember? Because if you don't keep the Three Jewels in your mind, you slide back. You lose ground.

The Tathāgataguhya Sūtra lays down the four things you gotta practice every day:

one. Faith (Śraddhā)
You gotta believe the road goes somewhere.
You approach the Wise Ones. You don't do what shouldn't be done.
That's faith with feet.

two. Respect (Gaurava)
When someone speaks the truth, you listen.
You don't got your headphones in. You got your ears open.
You hear the Dharma with an ear that don't wander off.

three. Humility (Nirmānatā)
You bow down to the Worthy Ones.
You honor them. You show reverence.
You ain't the center of the universe.

four. Vigor (Vīrya)
You move. You don't sit still.
Your body gets light. Your mind gets light.
You carry all the work through to the end.


# Part II: The Five Faculties

## Or Think of It Like This

The Akṣayamati Sūtra breaks it down five ways.
Five faculties (Indriya). Five instruments you play.

### one. Faith-Faculty
You believe four things:

Street-level right view: Karma works. What you do comes back.
The Bodhisattva Path: You don't get distracted by the small roads. You walk the big one.
Dependent Origination: You hear the deep teaching—emptiness, no-self, no-being, no-person—and you believe it. You don't cling to views.
Buddha-Dharmas: You believe in the Ten Powers, the Four Fearlessnesses. You got no doubt.

### two. Vigor-Faculty
Whatever you believe, you work for.
You make it real. You don't just nod your head.

### three. Memory-Faculty
Whatever you work for, you don't forget.
You keep it in your mind. You don't lose it.

### four. Concentration-Faculty
Whatever you remember, you focus on.
You make it one-pointed. You don't scatter.

### five. Wisdom-Faculty
Whatever you focus on, you see through.
You penetrate it. You know it for yourself.
Not because someone told you. Because you saw it.


# Part III: Remembering the Buddha

## The Golden One

How do you remember the Boss?
The Rāṣṭrapāla Sūtra sings it like this:

I bow to You, Golden One, with the Perfect Marks.
Your face is like the spotless moon.
Nobody in the three worlds compares to You.
You are without dust.

Your hair is beautiful. Your appearance is flawless.
You look at this suffering world with eyes like cool water.
You know the score.

You speak the truth, and it tastes sweet.
You tell us: this world is a stage, a hustle, a dream.
You tell us the "Self" is just a costume we wear.

We're all running around sick,
Chasing things we can't keep.
And here You come, the Great Physician,
Handing out the cure for free.

You remember His body. You remember His teaching. You remember His compassion.
You keep Him in your mind like a lamp in the dark.


# Part IV: Remembering the Dharma

## The Law That Don't Play Favorites

The Dharma ain't just rules. It's the Law of Gravity.
The Dharmasaṃgīti Sūtra tells you how it works:

The Law is Equal (Sama).
It don't care if you're a king or a beggar.
Gravity pulls you down the same.

The Law is Timeless (Akālika).
It don't wait for Tuesday. It's happening right now.
"Come and see. "

The Law is Impartial.
It don't shine brighter for the rich.
It works the night shift and the day shift.

The Law is Fearless.
It don't need you to protect it.
It protects you.

You gotta think like the Dharma:
The Dharma don't look for high or low. Neither should you.
The Dharma don't need praise. Neither should you.
The Dharma don't run out. Neither should your compassion.


# Part V: Remembering the Sangha

## The Shape-Shifters

The Sangha ain't just the folks in robes.
The Vimalakīrti Sūtra tells you who they really are:

In a split second, they can look like anything.
They play old. They play sick. They play dead—
Just to wake you up.

If the world is ending, they show you the fire.
If you think you're gonna live forever, they show you the clock ticking.

They walk into a famine and become bread.
They walk into a plague and become medicine.
They walk into a war zone and become the peace treaty.

They infiltrate every scene.
They could be the bartender, the bus driver, or the King of Gods.
They act the part perfectly, just to get you to drop the script.

They are the Skillful Ones (Upāyakuśala).
They take a thousand forms to save you.

You remember them. You honor them. You walk with them.


# Part VI: The Light Rays (The Broadcast)

## What the Buddha Does

The Ratnolkādhāraṇī tells you what happens when the Buddha sends out light.
He's like a radio tower, broadcasting on a million frequencies at once.

Whatever you need, He's got a station for it.

The Flower Station (Mālyavyūhā)
Rains down flowers and jewels so you stop gripping your wallet so tight.

The Peace Station (Śāntikarī)
Cools down your anger. Makes you wanna go sit in the woods and listen to the birds.

The Harvest Station (Sasyasaṃpādanī)
Makes the crops grow. Feeds the hungry so they can think about something other than their belly.

The Wisdom Station (Prajñāpradīpa)
Turns on the lights. Shows you the monsters under the bed are just piles of laundry.
Shows you the "Self" is a magic trick.

The Fearless Station (Abhayaṃdadā)
Breaks the chains. If you're locked up, He sets you free.
If you're scared, He stands in front of you.

The Medicine Station (Indriyaviśodhanī)
Cleans your eyes so you can see.
Cleans your ears so you can hear the music.
Fixes the broken connection.

You see?
The Buddha ain't sitting still. He's working.
Light pouring out. Stations broadcasting. Help coming in.


# Part VII: Loving-Kindness (The Secret Power)

## Why All This Matters

The Candrapradīpa Sūtra tells you the secret:

You can make offerings to Buddhas
In billions of worlds,
But it don't compare
To the merit of a loving mind.

Loving-kindness (Maitrī) is the power source.

No matter how much you give, how many prayers you say, how many shrines you build—
If your mind ain't got love in it, you're running on empty.

But if you got love?
You're unstoppable.


Thus ends the Eighteenth Chapter: The Three on Repeat.
(Ratnatrayānusmṛti — Remembering the Three Jewels)


## Bluesman's Notes

one. The Four and the Five: The text gives you two frameworks: Four Dharmas (faith, respect, humility, vigor) and Five Faculties (faith, vigor, memory, concentration, wisdom). They overlap. Use whichever one sticks.
two. The Buddha Verses: The Rāṣṭrapāla verses are beautiful. They describe the Buddha's physical form, but they're really about His compassion. He looks at the world "with eyes like cool water"—that's the key line.
three. The Dharma as Law: The Dharma is described as "sama" (equal), "akālika" (timeless), "ehipaśyika" (come and see). It's not a religion you join; it's a law you discover.
four. The Sangha as Skillful: The bodhisattvas in the Vimalakīrti Sūtra are undercover agents. They take every form imaginable to save beings. That's the Sangha at its deepest.
five. The Light Rays: The Ratnolkādhāraṇī describes the Buddha's light rays by function. The Sanskrit text actually lists fifty specific light rays, each with its own name and job—rays that give fearlessness, food, wisdom, healing, protection, purification, and more. I've given you six representative stations as examples (The Flower Station, The Peace Station, The Harvest Station, The Wisdom Station, The Fearless Station, The Medicine Station), but the Boss is broadcasting on every frequency you can imagine. Whatever beings need, there's a ray for that. The full fifty includes rays for worship, offerings, maturing beings through various means, and complete purification of body, speech, and mind. The six I chose represent the full spectrum of what the Buddha does: calming anger, feeding hunger, giving wisdom, granting fearlessness, and healing what's broken.
six. Loving-Kindness: The chapter ends with maitrī—loving-kindness—as the ultimate merit-maker. Without love, all the practice is empty.
