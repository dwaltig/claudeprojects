# Chapter twelve: The Workshop (Cittaparikarma)
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Blues Vernacular Translation by William Altig


The twelfth chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on mind-training—going to the Workshop to work on your mind, using the tools of concentration, facing the three poisons (desire, hatred, delusion), and building the unshakeable foundation.


# Part I: Going to the Workshop

## You Gotta Work on Your Mind

So you dwelling in the forest now. ¹
You left the City of Noise behind.
Now what?

Now you gotta work on your mind.

Dwelling in the forest, devote yourself to concentration. (Kārikā)

The Bhagavatī says it plain: ²

"He, for the sake of those very beings, practicing the perfection of meditation, becomes one of undistracted mind.

Why? He thinks like this:

'Even worldly meditation is hard to obtain for one of distracted mind—how much more the supreme perfect awakening!

Therefore, I must be of undistracted mind, until I awaken to supreme perfect awakening. '"

You understand? Even worldly meditation is hard when your mind scattered.
How you gonna get supreme awakening with a scattered mind?

You can't.

So you gotta get undistracted. You gotta focus.
You gotta work on your mind.


## The Workshop Opens: Sense Restraint

The Prajñāpāramitā teaches: ³

Listen to what the bodhisattva does from the first mind-arising:

"Practicing the perfection of meditation, with mental attention yoked to all-aspect knowledge, he enters meditation.

What does that look like?

"Seeing forms with the eye, he does not grasp at signs, does not grasp at features.

For one dwelling with the eye-faculty unguarded, desire and depression, and other unwholesome states would assault the mind—
he practices their restraint, guards the eye-faculty.

Same for the rest:

"Hearing sounds with the ear—
Smelling scents with the nose—
Tasting flavors with the tongue—
Touching tangibles with the body—
Knowing mental objects with the mind—

He does not grasp at signs, does not grasp at features.

For one dwelling with the mind-faculty unguarded, unwholesome states would assault the mind—
he practices their restraint, guards the mind-faculty. "

Now watch what this restraint looks like in practice:

"Walking, standing, sitting, lying down, speaking—
he does not abandon the state of concentration.

How does he carry himself?

"He is not one whose hands are restless.
Not one whose feet are restless.
Not one whose face is restless.
Not one of scattered speech.
Not one of distracted faculties.
Not agitated. Not inflated. Not restless.
Not lazy.
Not of confused body. Not of confused mind.

Calmed in body. Calmed in speech. Calmed in mind.

In secret and in public, proper in conduct.
Content.
Easy to support. Easy to maintain.
Of excellent conduct and dwelling.

Even in a gathering, delighting in solitude.
In gain and loss, even, unchanged.
Not elated, not dejected.

Thus in pleasure and pain—
in praise and blame—
in fame and disrepute—
in life and death—
even, unchanged, not elated, not dejected.

Thus with enemy and friend.
In pleasant and unpleasant events.
In noble and ignoble people.
In pure and mixed sounds.
In agreeable and disagreeable forms—
even, unchanged, not elated, not dejected.
Free from attraction and repulsion.

Why?

"Because he sees all dharmas as empty of own-nature, unborn, unproduced, unarisen. "

That's the foundation.
That's how you work in the Workshop.

You see forms? Don't grab the sign.
You hear sounds? Don't grab the feature.
You stay even. Unchanged.

Walking or sitting, eating or sleeping—
you don't abandon concentration.

That's the work.


# Part II: The Tools - Dealing with Torpor and Agitation

## When the Mind Gets Sleepy

When the mind sinks into torpor (līna), what you do?

Stir it up with joy meditation (muditā bhāvanā). **

When the mind gets agitated (uddhata), what you do?

Calm it down with impermanence reflection.


## The Medicine for Both: Remember the Rarity

The Rāṣṭrapāla gives you verses for when you need both—
to counter torpor and agitation together: ⁴

"After hundreds of millions of kalpas,
once in a while a Buddha arises—
a Great Sage, benefactor of the world.

That supreme moment has been obtained today.
If you want liberation, abandon heedlessness!

Think about it:

"Seeing that conditioned things are like illusions,
like lies, like dreams—
separation from all the beloved will come soon.
Nothing here lasts.

Exert yourself! Strive always
in the perfections, in the grounds, in the powers!
Never let vigor slip
until you awaken to supreme awakening! "

That's the tool.
When you drowsy? Remember the rarity.
When you agitated? Remember impermanence.


## The Burning House

The Lalitavistara adds more fuel: ⁵

Listen to this:

"The triple world is ablaze—
burning with old age, disease, suffering,
blazing with the fire of death.
This helpless world, without refuge,
wanders constantly like a bee trapped in a pot.

That's where you at. Trapped in the pot.

"The triple world is impermanent,
like autumn clouds.
Birth and death in the world
are like a stage performance, like actors.

Life passes quickly in the world—
quick as lightning in the sky,
like water rushing down a mountain river.

You hear that? Quick as lightning. Water rushing down.

"Beings in the world—
on earth, in divine realms, in the three wretched paths—
wandering in the five destinies,
driven by thirst and ignorance,
unaware—
like pots spinning on the potter's wheel.

Spinning on the wheel. Round and round.

"This world filled with Kalpa's snares—
surrounded by pleasant forms,
loving sounds,
beautiful scents, tastes, and touch-pleasures—
like a monkey caught in a hunter's trap.

Caught in the trap.

"The pleasures of desire—
always frightening, always creating enemies,
full of sorrow and calamity.
Like swords, like poison leaves—
abandoned by the noble like a dung-pit.

Like a dung-pit. That's what desire is.

"Destroying mindfulness,
creating darkness,
always causes of fear,
roots of suffering—
increasing the creeper of thirst for existence—
frightening, no refuge—
such are the pleasures of desire.

That's what you working against.
That's what you in the Workshop to fix.

"Like blazing fire-pits—frightening—
so are these desires, known by the noble.
Like great swamps.
Like sword-points.
Like honey smeared on a razor's edge.

Like a serpent's head.
Like a dung-pit.
Like sword-points.
Like dogs and jackals with hostile faces fighting over carrion.

Fleeting as the moon's reflection.
Like echoes in mountain caves.
Like reflections.
Like stage performances.
Like dreams—known by the noble.

Momentary, transient—such are the pleasures of desire.
Like illusions, like mirages, false.
Like bubbles, like foam, hollow.
Conceptually constructed—known by the Buddhas. "

You in the Workshop now.
You know what you working with.
Momentary. Transient. Hollow. False.

That's the raw material you dealing with.
Now let's get the tools out and start working.

# Part II: The Four Mountains (The Great Terrors)

## You Can't Run From These

The Rājāvavādaka Sūtra gives you the hardest teaching: ⁶

Listen, Great King:

"Suppose from the four directions four mountains came—
solid, substantial, unbroken, without cracks, without holes,
well-compacted, one solid mass,
touching the sky, scraping the earth,
crushing all grass, wood, branches, leaves, and straw,
grinding all beings, all creatures, all living things.

From them it would not be easy to escape by speed,
or to turn them back by strength, wealth, mantras, or medicines.

You can't run. You can't buy your way out. You can't spell your way out.

"Just so, Great King, four great terrors come,
from which it is not easy to escape by speed
or to turn them back by strength, wealth, mantras, or medicines.

What are the four?

The Four Mountains:

one. Old Age comes, crushing youth.
two. Disease comes, crushing health.
three. Death comes, crushing life.
four. Loss comes, crushing all prosperity.

"Why? Just as a lion, king of beasts—
beautiful, swift, well-formed with claws and fangs, terrifying—
enters a herd of deer,
seizes a deer,
and does what he wants with it—
that deer, encountering that powerful, fierce mouth,
becomes powerless—

Just so, Great King,
for one pierced by death's arrow,
with pride departed,
without refuge,
with vital points being cut and loosened,
with flesh and blood drying up,
with parched throat, thirsty, disturbed face,
limbs thrashing about,
unable to function, without strength,
smeared with saliva, snot, pus, urine, and feces,
with only a breath of life remaining,
depending on karma for the next birth,
terrified by Yama's messengers,
fallen under the power of the night of death,
on the last breaths being obstructed—

Alone, without companion,
leaving this world,
entering the next world,
walking the great path,
entering the great wilderness,
descending into the great abyss,
proceeding into the great darkness,
being carried away by the great ocean,
blown by the wind of karma,
going to a signless direction—

There is no other protection,
no other refuge,
no other resort
except the Dharma.

You hear that? Except the Dharma.

"The Dharma, Great King, at that time becomes protection, shelter, refuge, resort.

Just as for one afflicted by cold—the warmth of fire.
For one whose fire has gone out—extinction.
For one afflicted by heat—coolness.
For one on a journey—a cool, shady grove.
For the thirsty—cold water.
For the hungry—excellent food.
For the sick—doctor, medicine, attendants.
For the frightened—powerful helpers, good companions, protection—

Just so, Great King, for one pierced by death's arrow,
with pride departed,
without protection, without refuge—
there is no other protection, no other refuge
except the Dharma.

That's the hard truth.
When the four mountains come?
Only the Dharma can save you.


## So What You Gonna Do?

The Buddha tells the King straight:

"Therefore, Great King,
you should be one who sees impermanence,
one who sees decay and destruction,
one frightened by the terror of death.

By Dharma, Great King, should you rule your kingdom—
not by unrighteousness.

Why? Even this body of yours, Great King—
even though carefully protected for a long time,
even though satisfied with excellent, pure, delicious food and drink,
supplied with what removes hunger and thirst—
the time of death will come.

Even if you eat the best food, wear the best clothes—

"Even though covered with fine garments—
Kāśi silk, Kauśeya, Dūkūla, cotton, wool—
lying on the ultimate bed—
the time of death will come,
your body covered with sweat-soaked, dirty, foul clothes.

Even if you smell good now—

"Even though this body of yours, Great King,
is perfumed with bath oils, unguents, incense, and flowers—
in a short time it will become foul-smelling.

Even if you surrounded by lovers—

"Even though dwelling in women's quarters,
surrounded by groups of women,
sung to with various instruments, songs, music, and dances,
happy, playing, enjoying, being served—
the time of death will come
with extreme suffering and depression.

Even if you live in a mansion—

"Even though dwelling in houses
plastered and painted,
with well-secured bolts,
with well-shut windows,
with many incense, perfume, flower lamps burning,
with hanging silk garlands and wreaths,
scattered with pearl flowers,
fumigated with scent vessels,
with arranged foot-stools, cushions, spreads, coverings, and pillows on couches—
lying there—

Yet again, in the charnel ground,
extremely repulsive,
filled with jackals, crows, vultures, and corpse-eaters,
with meat, bones, hair, blood, and fat—
there this body of yours will lie powerless on the earth.

That's where you end up. The charnel ground.


## The Final Journey

Listen to the rest:

"Even though mounted on elephants, horses, chariots,
with conches and drums being struck,
held under an umbrella,
fanned with yak-tail fans,
followed by many elephants, horses, chariots, and foot-soldiers,
bowed to by hundreds of thousands with joined palms—
after experiencing such departure—

Soon, motionless,
mounted on the death bed,
lifted by four men,
carried out through the southern gate of the city,
by mother, father, brothers, sisters, wife, sons, daughters, relatives, servants, workers, and employees—
with grieving hearts,
with disheveled arms,
beating their breasts,
crying out extremely pitifully—
'Alas, son! Alas, master! Alas, dear one! Alas, lord! '—
cried out by townsfolk and countryfolk,
seen with contempt,
carried to the charnel ground—

Again, eaten by crows, vultures, dogs, jackals, and others—
or those bones burned by fire,
or buried in the earth,
or washed by water,
or pulverized by wind, heat, and rain,
scattered in all directions—
there they will reach the state of rot.

You understand?

"Thus are all conditioned things impermanent.
Thus are they unstable. "

That's the reality.
That's what you working with in the Workshop.


# Part III: The Three Poisons and Their Tools

## Desire, Hatred, Delusion—Choose Your Tool

Among the defilements (kleśa), the main ones are: ⁷
desire (rāga),
hatred (dveṣa),
and delusion (moha).

For whichever one is strongest in you,
first cultivate its antidote.
And avoid its causes.


## Tool #one: Foulness Meditation (Desire's Antidote)

The Ratnamegha says: ⁸

"He practices the antidote to desire.
He avoids the causes that produce desire.

What is the antidote to desire?
Foulness meditation (aśubhā bhāvanā).

What are the causes that produce desire?
Beautiful forms in villages and towns.

What is foulness meditation?

Listen to what's actually in this body:

"In this body there are:
head-hair, body-hair, nails, teeth, dust, dirt,
skin, flesh, bones, sinews, veins,
kidneys, heart, spleen, lungs,
intestines, mesentery,
stomach, bowels,
belly-content, liver, feces, snot, sweat, phlegm, saliva, mucus,
fat, lymph, marrow, grease,
bile, phlegm, pus, blood,
brain, brain-membrane, tears. "

That's what in the body.

Now the bodhisattva investigates these things:

"In these substances the bodhisattva becomes one who examines.

Examining thus, he thinks:
'Even a fool, a stupid one, incapable, unskilled—
if he knew these substances,
he would not generate desire-mind.
How much more one of wisdom-nature! '

Thus the bodhisattva becomes one abundant in foulness meditation. "

You see what you looking at?
Head-hair, snot, pus, feces, blood.

You understand that? Even a fool wouldn't get desire if he saw it clearly.

That's the tool for desire.
Foulness meditation.


## The Butcher's Eye

The Prajñāpāramitā gives another angle: ⁹

"The bodhisattva practicing prajñāpāramitā
knows this very body as it really is.

Just as a butcher or butcher's apprentice,
having killed a cow,
having made four cuts with a sharp knife,
examines them standing or sitting—

Just so, the bodhisattva practicing prajñāpāramitā
knows this very body by elements as it really is:

'In this body there is earth-element,
water-element, fire-element, wind-element. '"

Like a butcher looking at cuts of meat.
Not seeing "cow"—seeing parts.

Not seeing "body"—seeing elements.

That's the tool.
The butcher's eye.


## The Grain Bag

The text continues: ¹⁰

"Just as a farmer's bag is full of various grains—
rice, wheat, sesame, millet, peas, beans, barley, lentils, mustard—
and a sighted person examining them would say:
'This is rice, this is wheat, these are sesame,
these are millet, these are peas, these are beans,
this is barley, these are lentils, these are mustard'—

Just so, the bodhisattva practicing prajñāpāramitā
examines this very body from the crown of the head down to the soles of the feet,
enclosed by skin, surrounded by hair,
full of various kinds of impurity, as it really is:

'In this body there are head-hair, body-hair, nails. . . [full list]. . .
brain, brain-membrane, eye-fluid, ear-fluid. '"

Like looking in a grain bag.
Separating the types.
Seeing clearly.

That's foulness meditation.
That's the tool for desire.


## The Charnel Ground Workshop

But the real work? It happens at the charnel ground. ¹¹

The Prajñāpāramitā continues:

"The bodhisattva goes to the charnel ground.
He sees various forms of dead bodies
thrown in the charnel ground,
discarded on corpse-beds—
dead one day, two days, three days, four days, five days—
swollen, blue, putrid, decaying.

He applies this to his own body:
'This body too is of that nature,
of that character,
has not escaped that law. '

You see a corpse one day dead? Apply it to yourself.
Two days dead, swollen, blue? Apply it to yourself.

"Thus the bodhisattva dwells contemplating the body in the body externally.

Again, when he sees dead bodies thrown in the charnel ground,
being eaten by crows, vultures, dogs, jackals,
and other various kinds of creatures—

He applies this to his own body:
'This body too is of that nature. '

Crows eating it. Dogs fighting over it.
That's your body too.

"Again, when he sees dead bodies thrown in the charnel ground—
devoured, impure, foul-smelling—

He applies this to his own body. "

Keep applying it. Keep seeing it.

"Again, when he sees on the corpse-path
a skeleton of bones,
smeared with flesh and blood,
held together by sinews—

He applies this to his own body. "

Skeleton with some meat still on it.
Sinews holding it together.
That's you.

"Again, when he sees on the corpse-path
bones become a skeleton,
flesh and blood gone,
sinew-bonds gone—

He applies this to his own body. "

Just bones now. Sinews gone.
That's you.

"Again, when he sees on the corpse-path
bones scattered in all directions—
here foot-bones,
here shin-bones,
here thigh-bones,
here hip-bones,
here spine,
here rib-bones,
here neck-bones,
here arm-bones—

He applies this to his own body. "

Scattered everywhere. Separated.
That's you.

"Again, when he sees on the corpse-path
bones many years old,
dried by wind,
resembling shells—

He applies this to his own body:
'This body too is of that nature,
of that character,
has not escaped that law. '

Years old. Wind-dried. White like shells.
That's you.

"Again, the bodhisattva practicing prajñāpāramitā,
when he sees on the corpse-path
bones many years old—
blue, pigeon-colored,
rotten, pulverized,
become dust on the earth,
mixed with dust, indistinguishable—

He applies this to his own body:
'This body too is of that nature,
of that character,
has not escaped that law. '"

Finally? Dust. Just dust.
Mixed with the earth. Can't tell the difference.

That's where your body goes.
That's the Workshop reality.

When you see it clear like that?
Desire ain't got nowhere to stand.


# Part IV: Tool #two - Loving-Kindness (Hatred's Antidote)

## The Antidote to Hatred

Briefly stated: Loving-kindness (maitrī) is the antidote to hatred. ¹²

And the cause of hatred?
Seeing unpleasant beings.
Or being forced to share food and such with them,
which generates dislike.

What is loving-kindness?

"Wishing for the happiness of others.
Praying for it.
Thirsting for it.
Delighting in it.

This is loving-kindness—
undefiled affection,
not caused by sensual desire or expectation of return. "

You want them happy. You pray they happy. You thirst for their happiness.
That's loving-kindness.


## Three Types of Loving-Kindness

The Akṣayamati Sūtra teaches three types: ¹³

one. Loving-kindness with beings as object
For bodhisattvas of first mind-arising.

two. Loving-kindness with dharmas as object
For bodhisattvas in the practice stage.

three. Loving-kindness with no object (anārambaṇā maitrī)
For bodhisattvas who have attained acceptance of non-arising dharmas.


## How to Practice: Start With the Easy Ones

The method: ¹⁴

"First, for dear beings, do not cultivate meditation
by bringing to mind their benefit and happiness.

Cultivate loving-kindness for those equal to you.
Then for those you've associated with before.
Then for indifferent ones.
Then for those dwelling nearby.
Then for those dwelling in your own village.
Then in another village.

Thus, having resolved on one direction,
having pervaded and entered it, dwell.
Thus in the ten directions. "

Start with people you already like—but don't make it attachment.
Then move to neutral folks.
Then the difficult ones.
Expand it out—your street, your town, other towns.
Then all directions.

For Buddha-object, bodhisattva-object, śrāvaka-pratyekabuddha-object loving-kindness?
You don't need this gradual practice. Just do it directly.


## The Dedication Prayer: Make Them Happy

The Vajradhvaja Pariṇāmanā gives the full teaching: ¹⁵

Listen to how the bodhisattva dedicates merit:

"Practicing bodhisattva conduct,
whatever forms are seen—pleasing or disagreeable,
whatever sounds, scents, flavors, tangibles, mental objects—
pleasing or disagreeable,
pure, excellent, bright, brilliant—
from which gladness arises,
happiness descends,
serenity arises,
joy is born,
delight abides,
rapture appears,
depression departs,
mental pliancy appears,
the mind becomes workable,
intentions become soft,
faculties attain delight—

Constantly experiencing happiness,
he dedicates thus:

Now listen to the dedication:

"By this dedication, in greater measure,
may all those Buddhas, Blessed Ones,
be endowed with inconceivable Buddha-dwelling happiness!
Be well-gathered by incomparable Buddha-samādhi happiness!
Be supported by boundless happiness in greater measure!
Be endowed with immeasurable Buddha-liberation happiness!
Be well-gathered by immeasurable Buddha-miracle happiness!
Be well-grasped by inconceivable Buddha-unimpeded-dwelling happiness!
Be covered by difficult-to-approach Buddha-fearlessness happiness!
Be supremely happy with immeasurable Buddha-power happiness!
Be happy with mastery-happiness of all-knowing pacified non-arising happiness!
Be happy with unimpeded happiness of the attachment-free dwelling,
constantly concentrated Tathāgata happiness,
non-dual conduct! "

That's for the Buddhas.

Now for the bodhisattvas:

"Having thus dedicated that wholesome root to the Tathāgatas,
he dedicates to the bodhisattvas:

For the fulfillment of incomplete intentions!
For the purification of unpurified omniscience-aspirations!
For the completion of incomplete perfections!
For the stabilization of vajra-like bodhicitta-arising!
For the non-turning-back of the irrevocable omniscience-armor!
For the strengthening of bodhisattvas' wholesome roots!
For the fulfillment of the great aspiration dwelling in equality with all worlds!
For the attainment of all bodhisattva-dwellings!
For the sharpening of all bodhisattva faculties!
For all bodhisattvas' wholesome roots to contact omniscience! "

For the śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas:

"Having thus dedicated that wholesome root for the benefit of bodhisattvas,
he dedicates that very wholesome root
to all śrāvakas and pratyekabuddhas dwelling in the Buddha's teaching:

For Buddha-recollection fulfillment!
For Dharma-recollection practice!
For reverence for the noble Sangha!
For not-long-delayed Buddha-vision!
For mind-purification!
For penetration of Buddha-dharmas!
For attainment of immeasurable qualities!
For purification of all superknowledge skills!
For removal of doubt about the Dharma! "

And for all beings who hear even one syllable of Buddha's teaching:

"Whatever beings hear even one syllable of the Buddha's word,
the Dharma word,
or attend upon the noble Sangha—
for them he dedicates that wholesome root to supreme perfect awakening! "

That's the dedication.
You make everybody happy.
Buddhas, bodhisattvas, disciples, all beings.

That's loving-kindness.
That's the tool for hatred.


# Part V: Tool #three - Dependent Origination (Delusion's Antidote)

## Seeing How Things Lean on Things

For the underlying tendency of delusion (moha),
the antidote is seeing dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda darśana). ¹⁶


## The Śālistamba Teaching: How It All Connects

The Śālistamba Sūtra teaches: ¹⁷

"What is the causal basis of internal dependent origination?

Conditioned by ignorance, formations.
Conditioned by formations, consciousness.
[And so on through the twelve links]
Conditioned by birth, old age and death.

Now listen close to how it works:

"If ignorance did not exist,
formations would not come to be.

If birth did not exist,
old age and death would not come to be.

But when ignorance exists,
the arising of formations occurs.

When birth exists,
the arising of old age and death occurs. "

You understand? It's all connected. Leaning on each other.

But here's the key—nothing's doing it on purpose:

"Ignorance does not think:
'I produce formations. '

Formations do not think:
'We are produced by ignorance. '

Birth does not think:
'I produce old age and death. '

Old age and death do not think:
'We are produced by birth. '

But when ignorance exists,
the arising and appearance of formations occurs.

When birth exists,
the arising and appearance of old age and death occurs.

Nobody's running it. It just happens.
Conditions meet. Things arise.

That's how you should see internal dependent origination's causal basis.


## The Six Elements: The Conditions

How should you see the conditional basis? ¹⁸

"By the coming together of six elements.

What six?
Earth-element, water-element, fire-element,
wind-element, space-element, consciousness-element.

What do they do?

Earth-element:
"What produces the body's solidity, hardness—
this is called earth-element. "

Water-element:
"What performs the function of holding the body together—
this is called water-element. "

Fire-element:
"What digests the body's eaten, drunk, chewed food—
this is called fire-element. "

Wind-element:
"What performs the function of in-breath and out-breath—
this is called wind-element. "

Space-element:
"What produces the body's internal hollowness—
this is called space-element. "

Consciousness-element:
"What produces name-and-form,
conjoined with the five-consciousness-group
and defiled mental consciousness—
this is called consciousness-element. "

When the conditions ain't complete? The body don't arise.

When the internal earth-element is complete,
and water, fire, wind, space, consciousness-elements are complete,
then from the coming together of all,
the body arises.

But here's what they don't do:

"The earth-element does not think:
'I produce the body's hardness. '

The water-element does not think:
'I perform the holding-together function. '

The fire-element does not think:
'I digest the food. '

The wind-element does not think:
'I perform the breathing function. '

The space-element does not think:
'I make internal hollowness. '

The consciousness-element does not think:
'I am produced by these conditions. '

But when these conditions exist,
the body arises. "

Nobody planning it. Nobody making it happen.
Conditions meet. Body arises.


## What They Ain't

Now here's what's important: ¹⁹

"The earth-element is not a self,
not a being, not a life, not a person,
not a human, not a man,
not a woman, not a male, not a neuter,
not 'I', not 'mine',
not anyone else's.

So too the water-element, fire-element, wind-element,
space-element, consciousness-element—
not a being, not a life, not a person,
not a human, not a man,
not a woman, not a male, not a neuter,
not 'I', not 'mine',
not anyone else's. "

You hear that? Not 'I'. Not 'mine'. Not anybody's.


## What Ignorance Is

So what's ignorance? ²⁰

"Whatever perception of oneness in these six elements,
perception of a lump,
perception of permanence,
perception of stability,
perception of eternity,
perception of pleasure,
perception of self,
perception of being, life, person, human—
perception of 'I-making' and 'mine-making'—
such various non-knowing—
this is called ignorance.

That's delusion. Seeing one where there's many. Seeing permanent where it's changing. Seeing self where there ain't none.

"When ignorance exists,
desire, hatred, and delusion operate toward objects.

Whatever desire, hatred, delusion toward objects—
these are called formations.

Cognition of objects is consciousness.

The four formless aggregates together with consciousness—
that's name[-and-form].

The four great elements and the form derived from them,
briefly combined—
that's name-and-form.

The faculties based on name-and-form—
the six sense-bases.

The meeting of three dharmas—contact.

Experience of contact—feeling.

Grasping at feeling—craving.

Amplification of craving—clinging.

Karma born from clinging that produces next-becoming—becoming.

Appearance of aggregates from that cause—birth.

Maturation of aggregates—old age.

Destruction of aggregates—death. "

You see how it all connects?
Ignorance → formations → consciousness → name-and-form → six sense-bases → contact → feeling → craving → clinging → becoming → birth → old age and death.

One leans on the next. The next leans on the next.
Like dominoes falling.


## The Rice-Seedling Example

The text gives an example: ²¹

"Just as from five causes eye-consciousness arises:

Depending on the eye,
and on form,
and on light,
and on space,
and on appropriate mental attention—
eye-consciousness arises.

The eye performs the function of basis.
Form performs the function of object.
Light performs the function of illumination.
Space performs the function of non-obstruction.
Appropriate mental attention performs the function of bringing together.

When the conditions don't exist,
eye-consciousness doesn't arise.

When the internal eye sense-base is complete,
and form, light, space, appropriate mental attention are complete,
then from the coming together of all,
eye-consciousness arises. "

Same thing. Conditions meet. Consciousness arises.

"The eye does not think:
'I perform the basis function for eye-consciousness. '

Form does not think:
'I perform the object function. '

Light does not think:
'I perform the illumination function. '

Space does not think:
'I perform the non-obstruction function. '

Appropriate mental attention does not think:
'I perform the bringing-together function. '

Eye-consciousness does not think:
'I am produced by these conditions. '

But when these conditions exist,
eye-consciousness arises, appears. "

Nobody making it happen. Nobody running it.
Conditions meet. It arises.

That's dependent origination.
That's how you see through delusion.


## Five Ways to See It

Internal dependent origination should be seen five ways: ²²

one. Not eternal
"Because different are the death-moment aggregates,
different the birth-moment aggregates.
Not the very same death-moment aggregates
are the birth-moment aggregates.
But the death-moment aggregates cease,
the birth-moment aggregates appear.
Therefore, not eternal. "

two. Not annihilated
"Not after aggregates have ceased
do birth-moment aggregates appear,
nor while they haven't ceased.
But the death-moment aggregates cease,
the birth-moment aggregates appear.
Like a balance beam rising and falling.
Therefore, not annihilated. "

three. Not transferred
"From a different being-collection,
different aggregates arise in another birth.
Therefore, not transferred. "

four. Small cause, big result
"Small karma is done,
large fruit-ripening is experienced.
Therefore, from small cause, large result arises. "

five. Similar continuity
"As the karma is done to be felt,
so the ripening is felt.
Therefore, similar continuity. "

You understand?
Not eternal—but not annihilated.
Not transferred—but it continues.
Small causes, big results.
Similar to what you did.

That's the Workshop understanding.
That's how you work with the mind.


## The Final Word

Briefly stated: ²³

This is the antidote to desire-manifestation—foulness meditation.

This is the antidote to hatred-manifestation—loving-kindness.

This is the antidote to delusion—seeing dependent origination.


Thus ends the Twelfth Chapter: The Workshop.


# Theological Notes

### The Workshop Metaphor
The forest becomes the Workshop—the place where you go to do the hard work of mind-training. This isn't passive meditation; it's active craftsmanship. You've got tools (foulness, loving-kindness, dependent origination), raw material (the untrained mind with its three poisons), and the work of transformation.

### The Four Mountains
The Rājāvavādaka's teaching of the four mountains (old age, disease, death, loss) coming from the four directions is one of the most powerful memento mori teachings in Buddhism. You can't run. You can't buy your way out. Only the Dharma protects.

### The Charnel Ground as Workshop Floor
The extended charnel ground contemplations transform the graveyard into the ultimate workshop floor. You work with the reality of decay, applying each stage to your own body. This isn't morbid—it's clear-eyed realism that cuts through delusion and desire.

### Three Tools for Three Poisons

Poison: Desire (rāga); Tool: Foulness meditation; Method: See body as hair, snot, pus, blood; charnel ground stages.
Poison: Hatred (dveṣa); Tool: Loving-kindness; Method: Wish happiness for all; dedicate merit systematically.
Poison: Delusion (moha); Tool: Dependent origination; Method: See how things lean on things; no self running it.

### Dependent Origination as Blues Wisdom
The teaching that "nobody's making it happen—conditions meet, things arise" is pure Blues wisdom. It's not fatalism (that would be eternal), not randomness (that would be annihilation), but the middle way—things happen because of conditions, not because of a self or an external controller. Small actions, big consequences. Similar to what you did.

### The Six Elements Teaching
Breaking the body down into earth (hardness), water (cohesion), fire (digestion), wind (breath), space (hollowness), and consciousness (awareness) shows there's no "you" running it—just elements doing their thing. Not 'I', not 'mine', not anybody's.


## Endnotes

¹ Chapter opening: Following forest dwelling (Ch eleven), the work of concentration begins.

² Bhagavatī: "Even worldly meditation is difficult for distracted mind—how much more supreme awakening! "

³ Prajñāpāramitā sense restraint: Full teaching on not grasping signs/features while maintaining concentration in all postures. The bodhisattva remains "even, unchanged, not elated, not dejected" through all circumstances because he sees dharmas as empty of own-nature.

⁴ Rāṣṭrapāla verses: Antidote for both torpor and agitation—remember rarity of Buddha-appearance, impermanence of conditioned things.

⁵ Lalitavistara extended similes: Triple world as burning house, potter's wheel, bee in pot; life as lightning, rushing water; desires as fire-pits, swamps, sword-points, razor's edge, serpent's head, dung-pit, stage performance, dreams, illusions, mirages, bubbles, foam.

⁶ Rājāvavādaka Sūtra: The four mountains teaching—old age, disease, death, and loss come from four directions like solid mountains. Cannot escape by speed or turn back by wealth, mantras, medicines. Only Dharma protects. Extended description of death process and charnel ground destination.

⁷ Three main defilements: Among kleśas, rāga (desire), dveṣa (hatred), and moha (delusion) are primary. Cultivate the antidote for whichever is strongest; avoid its causes.

⁸ Ratnamegha on desire antidote: Aśubhā bhāvanā (foulness meditation) is the antidote. Causes of desire: beautiful forms in villages/towns. Method: investigate the thirty-two parts of the body—head-hair to brain-membrane. "Even a fool wouldn't generate desire if he knew these substances. "

⁹ Prajñāpāramitā butcher simile: Just as butcher makes four cuts and examines them, bodhisattva knows body by four elements—earth, water, fire, wind.

¹⁰ Grain bag simile: Just as sighted person separates grain types in farmer's bag, bodhisattva examines body parts from crown to soles, seeing various impurities clearly.

¹¹ Charnel ground contemplations: Nine stages—one) Dead one to five days, swollen, blue, putrid; two) Eaten by crows, vultures, dogs, jackals; three) Devoured, foul-smelling; four) Skeleton with flesh/blood, held by sinews; five) Skeleton without flesh/blood; six) Bones scattered in directions; seven) Bones years old, white like shells; eight) Bones blue, pigeon-colored, rotten; nine) Bones pulverized to dust, mixed with earth. At each stage: "This body too is of that nature, has not escaped that law. "

¹² Maitrī defined: Wishing for others' happiness, praying for it, thirsting for it, delighting in it. Undefiled affection not caused by sensual desire or expectation of return. Seeing unpleasant beings is the cause of hatred.

¹³ Three types of maitrī (Akṣayamati Sūtra): one) Beings-as-object (first mind-arising bodhisattvas), two) Dharmas-as-object (practice-stage bodhisattvas), three) No-object/anārambaṇā (bodhisattvas with non-arising dharma acceptance).

¹⁴ Method of practice: Don't cultivate by bringing to mind benefit/happiness of dear beings (to avoid attachment). Start with equals, then associates, indifferent ones, nearby dwellers, own village, other villages. Expand to one direction, then all ten directions. Buddha/bodhisattva/śrāvaka-object maitrī doesn't need gradual practice.

¹⁵ Vajradhvaja Pariṇāmanā: Extended dedication prayer dedicating all pleasant experiences to: one) Buddhas' inconceivable happiness; two) Bodhisattvas' completion of intentions, perfections, grounds; three) Śrāvakas/pratyekabuddhas' recollection, purification; four) All beings who hear even one syllable of teaching—for supreme awakening.

¹⁶ Delusion antidote: Pratītyasamutpāda darśana (seeing dependent origination) is the antidote to moha's underlying tendency.

¹⁷ Śālistamba Sūtra teaching: Internal dependent origination—twelve links from ignorance to old age/death. Key point: "Ignorance does not think 'I produce formations. ' Formations do not think 'We are produced by ignorance. '" But when ignorance exists, formations' arising occurs. Mutual arising without agent.

¹⁸ Six elements: Earth (solidity/hardness), water (holding together), fire (digestion), wind (breath), space (internal hollowness), consciousness (producing name-and-form with five consciousness groups). When conditions incomplete, body doesn't arise. When complete elements come together, body arises—but none think "I perform this function. "

¹⁹ What elements are not: Not self, being, life, person, human, man, woman, male, neuter, 'I', 'mine', anyone else's. Same for all six elements.

²⁰ Ignorance defined: Perception of oneness, lump, permanence, stability, eternity, pleasure, self, being, 'I-making', 'mine-making' in the six elements. Various non-knowing. From ignorance → formations (desire/hatred/delusion toward objects) → consciousness → name-and-form → six sense-bases → contact → feeling → craving → clinging → becoming → birth → old age/death.

²¹ Eye-consciousness example: Arises from five causes—eye (basis), form (object), light (illumination), space (non-obstruction), mental attention (bringing together). None think "I perform this function. " When conditions exist, eye-consciousness arises.

²² Five ways to see dependent origination: one) Not eternal (different death/birth aggregates); two) Not annihilated (like balance beam); three) Not transferred (different being-collection); four) Small cause, large result; five) Similar continuity (as karma done, so ripening felt).

²³ Summary: Desire → foulness; Hatred → loving-kindness; Delusion → dependent origination.
