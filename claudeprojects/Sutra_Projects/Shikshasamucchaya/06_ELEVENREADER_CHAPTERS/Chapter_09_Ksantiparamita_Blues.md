# Chapter nine: The Perfection of Patience (Kṣāntipāramitā)
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Blues Vernacular Translation by William Altig


The ninth chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on the Perfection of Patience. Contains the famous Sarvadharmasukhākrānta samādhi teaching—how the bodhisattva attains a concentration where all dharmas are pervaded by happiness, feeling pleasure even under torture.


# Part I: The Sequence

## From Patience to Purification

Protecting against immorality, removing karma-obstruction, you strive for purification of afflictions. ¹ That's what we've covered. Now the sequence:

One should be patient.
One should approach learning.
Therefore one should resort to the forest.
One should apply oneself to concentration.
One should cultivate the foul and the rest. (Kārikā twenty)

That's the path in five steps:
one. Patience—without it, your vigor for learning gets obstructed
two. Learning—without it, you don't know the method of concentration
three. Forest—concentration is hard for one whose conduct is mixed
four. Concentration—calming distraction
five. Foul meditation—for the final purification of afflictions


# Part II: Three Ways to Stand Your Ground

## The Dharmasaṃgīti Teaching

Listen. Patience comes in three forms: ²

one. Patience of enduring suffering (duḥkhādhivāsanakṣānti)
Standing your ground when life hurts.

two. Patience of contemplating dharmas (dharmanidhyānakṣānti)
Standing your ground in the truth.

three. Patience of bearing harm from others (parāpakāramarṣaṇakṣānti)
Standing your ground when people come at you.

What breaks the first kind?
When the undesired arrives: suffering-wailing—you crying out.
When the desired gets blocked: clinging to pleasure—you holding on tight.

From these? Sorrow rises. Then hatred. Then depression.
You fall apart.


## Don't Cling, Don't Recoil

The Candrapradīpa Sūtra lays it down: ³

"Non-attachment to pleasure.
Non-aversion to pain. "

That's the key. That's the whole thing.
Don't cling to what feels good.
Don't recoil from what hurts.

Stand your ground.


## The Eight Worldly Dharmas

The Ugradattaparipṛcchā teaches: ⁴

"A householder bodhisattva should be free from attraction and repulsion,
unstained by the eight worldly dharmas.

What does that look like?

By gain, by gain of wife and son, by gain of wealth—
he should not be elated, should not be overjoyed.

And in all misfortunes,
he should not be cast down. He should not be sorrowful.

Win? Don't get happy.
Lose? Don't get sad.

How do you do that?

Thus he should contemplate:
'All conditioned things are magically created,
characterized by the presence of disappearance.
These—mother, father, son, wife, servants, relatives—
are produced by karma-ripening.
These are not mine, I am not theirs. '"

You hear that last line?
These are not mine, I am not theirs.

That's the teaching.
The eight worldly dharmas—gain/loss, fame/disrepute, praise/blame, pleasure/pain—
you're unstained by all of them.

They don't touch you. They pass through you like wind.


# Part III: The Futility of Worry

## Stop Worrying

Listen to this logic:

If there is indeed a remedy, what use is sorrow?

You can fix it? Then why you sad?

Even in remedy, the sorrowful one, faint with anger, is confused.

Even when you fixing it, if you sorrowful, you confused.

What about when you can't fix it?

Or, depressed, with killed vigor, he's seized by the opponent's misfortune.
By that worry, his short life goes vainly, moment by moment.

Depressed? Vigor dies. Life goes vainly.
Moment by moment, you wasting it.

So what you gonna do?

Therefore, by practice, one should abandon this useless, harm-bringing affliction.

Abandon worry. It's useless. It brings harm.

How do you abandon sorrow?
By relinquishing the light, delicate mind. ⁵
Stop being soft. Get hard.

The Gaṇḍavyūha gives you three minds to cultivate: ⁶

one. Difficult-to-conquer mind
For destroying all afflictions. Hard to beat.

two. Unconquered mind
For breaking through all attachments. Can't be conquered.

three. Imperturbable mind
For those in ocean-whirlpools of corrupt intentions. Can't be disturbed.

Get those three minds. Stop worrying.


## Nothing's Difficult for Practice

Nothing is difficult for practice. ⁷ Even the foolish—burden-carriers, fishermen, farmers—by practice of suffering, in trivial matters, the mind marked with hardened calluses is not overcome by discouragement.

How much more so for work whose fruit is the unsurpassed state of all saṃsāra-happiness, all bodhisattva-happiness!

Even ordinary people fight unto death over small harms. How much more should there be vigor toward affliction-enemies:
Who harm over long periods
Who steal even a fragment of wholesomeness
Who do not kill in hell but make one wander
Who destroy the door of escape
Who are enemies for immeasurable kalpas

Especially for one who has bound on armor for conquering the three worlds, fighting for the release of the world-captive seized by Māra!


# Part IV: The Happiness That Can't Be Killed

## Feeling Pleasure Under Torture

Listen to this. ⁸

Just as by practice, beings learn to feel suffering and pleasure—
so by practicing the perception of pleasure in all suffering,
the perception of pleasure alone arises.

This is the fruit: you attain the concentration called Sarvadharmasukhākrānta—
"All-Dharmas-Pervaded-by-Happiness. "

The Pitāputrasamāgama explains what this means: ⁹

"There is a concentration called Sarvadharmasukhākrānta.
By its attainment, the bodhisattva experiences only pleasant feeling
in all object-matters.

What does that mean?

For him, even when hellish torture is being done,
the perception of pleasure alone arises.

Listen to what that looks like:

Even when hands are being cut off—pleasure alone.
When feet are being cut off—pleasure alone.
When ears, when nose are being cut off—pleasure alone.

Even when being beaten with rods, with whips—pleasure alone.

Even when being boiled in oil,
pounded like sugarcane,
pressed like reeds,
burned with oil-lamps—
pleasure alone arises.

Even when eyes are being plucked out—pleasure alone.
Even when being impaled alive—pleasure alone.
Even when the head is being split—
pleasure alone proceeds, not suffering.

You hear what I'm saying?
They cutting you, beating you, burning you, killing you—
and you feeling pleasure.

How is that possible?

Why? The bodhisattva practicing for a long time
had this aspiration:

Listen to the aspiration:

'Those who would feed me—
may they attain the happiness of calm. '

'Those who would protect me, honor me, worship me—
may all attain the happiness of peace. '

'Those who would revile me, strike me, cut me with weapons, even kill me—
may all attain the happiness of awakening. '

You understand?
You been wishing awakening for them.
For years. For lifetimes.
So when they torture you? That wish rises.
And that wish? That wish feels like pleasure.

By this karma, by these aspirations,
he attains the concentration called Sarvadharmasukhākrānta.

At that time he becomes imperturbable,
unassailable by all Māra-works. "

That's the teaching.
The bodhisattva feels pleasure even under torture—
because he's wishing awakening for those who torture him.

That's the happiness that can't be killed.


## The Supreme Practice

This practice fulfills all relinquishment, accomplishes all difficult practices, makes firm all patience, brings all vigor to non-failure. ¹⁰

Therefore, one should always be joyful. The Candrapradīpa says:

With respect, with pleased mind, he should always be;
he should always stand with gentle gaze.


# Part V: Hell-Bound Resolve

## Sailing to Hell

The Mahāmegha says trained bodhisattvas are: ¹¹

Listen to this description:

"Those whose minds are constantly concentrated on the hell-destiny—
those who love the hell-destiny—
those who are merchants sailing to the hell-destiny.

You hear that? Merchants sailing to hell.
Not running from it. Sailing toward it.

Those who desire hell.
Those who are stingy-greedy for hell.
Those whose minds are attuned to hell-fire. "

Stingy-greedy for hell. Clutching it tight.
Attuned to hell-fire. In tune with the flames.

That's the training.
You're not avoiding hell—you're sailing to it.
For the sake of beings.

You a merchant, and your destination is hell.
You gonna trade there. You gonna work there.
You gonna save folks there.


# Part VI: The Unbreakable

## The Sāgaramati Armor

The Sāgaramati Sūtra teaches all three patience types: ¹²

Listen to what "not broken" means:

"The bodhisattva, regarding the jewel of the omniscience-mind-arising,
being harassed, disturbed, struck by ignoble beings,
by Māras, by Māra-possessed beings—
he is not broken.

Why not broken?

He is not broken due to the vigor of great compassion for all beings.
He is not broken due to exertion for the Three Jewel lineage.
He is not broken due to wholesome application.
He is not broken due to accumulating the merit-equipment.
He is not broken due to eagerness for buddha-field purification.
He is not broken due to relinquishment of body and life.
He is not broken due to non-reliance on self-happiness.

Eight reasons he don't break.

Now watch what he bears:

He bears the looking-down of all beings.
He bears the contempt of all beings.
He bears the reviling and abuse of all beings.
He bears the oppression of all beings.
He bears the burdens of all beings and raises them up.

You understand? He carrying it all.

What don't he do?

He is not wearied. He is not depressed.
He does not shrink. He does not despair.

What does he do?

He displays strength.
He generates firmness.
He undertakes vigor.

Now here's the refrain—listen to the beat:

Reviled, he does not revile in return.
Struck, he does not strike in return.
Provoked, he does not provoke in return.
Angered at, he does not become angry in return. "

That's the armor.
Not broken by anything—
not by Māra, not by beings, not by torture.

You hit him? He don't hit back.
You curse him? He don't curse back.
You provoke him? He don't provoke back.
You get angry? He don't get angry.

Unbreakable.


## The Armor You Put On

The bodhisattva binds on the armor: ¹³

Listen to this resolve:

"If all beings in the ten directions pursued me with swords, spears, javelins, clubs—
in whatever place I stand and generate bodhicitta—
they would cut my body into jujube-leaf pieces,
wound it, destroy it—

Cut into jujube-leaf pieces. Tiny pieces. Shredded.

Still I should not generate a hostile mind toward any being.

Why not?

Why? The beginningless beginning of saṃsāra is immeasurable.
This person of mine has been cut a hundredfold, wounded, tortured—
and from that, neither my purpose was accomplished nor others' purpose.

You been cut before. Hundred times. Thousand times.
Didn't help you. Didn't help them.
So what's the point of getting hostile now?

If all beings were to cut and destroy me to the end of the future—still:

Listen to the three things that don't change:

Omniscience is not to be abandoned.
All beings are not to be abandoned.
The wholesome Dharma-desire is not to be abandoned.

They can cut you forever.
Those three things? You don't abandon.

Now here's the perspective:

All this bodily oppression does not equal even a hundredth part of hellish suffering.
I'm able to bear even dwelling in hell.
But the Buddha-dharmas are not to be abandoned, nor the great compassion. "

You understand?
This torture? It ain't nothing compared to hell.
You can bear hell. You can bear this.

But you can't abandon the Buddha-dharmas.
You can't abandon great compassion.

That's the armor you put on.


## Abandon Body-Love

"Whatever is the cause from which ill-will arises—that dharma we will abandon. What is it? Body-love, body-nest, body-reliance. ¹⁴

The body is relinquished; ill-will is relinquished. "

That's the root. Body-attachment is the cause of ill-will. Relinquish the body; ill-will is relinquished.


# Part VII: The Six Perfections in Patience

## All Six Arise from Torture

Listen to this teaching: ¹⁵

When the body is being cut, all six perfections arise.

Watch how:

one. Giving
Relinquishment of the body.
You giving your body away.

two. Morality
Pervading all beings with loving-kindness, not withdrawing the feelings.
You loving them even as they cut you.

three. Patience
Enduring for the liberation of those who cut, not injured in mind.
You enduring for their freedom. Your mind ain't injured.

four. Vigor
Not abandoning omniscience-desire, taking hold of mind-power.
You still holding onto awakening. You holding your mind strong.

five. Meditation
Not confused regarding the omniscience-jewel, contemplating awakening alone.
You not confused. You contemplating awakening.

six. Wisdom
Examining the grass-wood-wall-like appearance of the body,
the dream-nature, the true impermanence, suffering, non-self, peace.
You seeing the body like grass, like wood, like a wall.
Like a dream. Impermanent, suffering, no-self, peace.

You understand?
All six perfections arise from patience under torture.

They cutting you? You perfecting all six at once.
That's the mastery.


# Part VIII: Searching for Self and Other

## Who Reviles? Who Is Reviled?

"Come! We will resort to the Dharmatā. Who reviles, or is reviled? Searching, he does not find that dharma. ¹⁶

He, with the view of non-apprehension of self and other removed, is patient. "

That's the ultimate patience. You search for reviler and reviled—you find nothing. From that, patience arises naturally.


## Like a Deaf-Mute Sheep

The Prajñāpāramitā gives you the discipline: ¹⁷

Listen to the bodhisattva thinking:

"I, by whom the dispute of all beings is to be removed—
I myself am disputing!
My gains are ill-gotten, that I'm speaking back when spoken to.

Think about that. You supposed to remove disputes, and you disputing.

I, by whom a bridge for all beings is to be made—
I speak even 'you' to another, or give a harsh reply.

You supposed to build the bridge, and you throwing harsh words.

So what you gonna do?

This should not be spoken by me, being like a dumb fool.
In quarrels and disputes, I should be like a deaf-mute sheep.

You hear that? Deaf-mute sheep.
Can't hear. Can't speak. Can't fight back.

Hearing harsh, ill-mannered speech,
I should not injure my mind.

They speaking harsh? Don't let it hurt your mind.

It is not proper for me to generate fault-finding toward another.
It is not proper for me even to hear of another's fault-finding.

Don't find fault. Don't even listen to fault-finding.

Why not?

My intention is not to be corrupted.
By me all beings are to be made happy, brought to parinirvāṇa.
There I should not be ill-willed.

You got a job. Make 'em happy. Bring 'em to nirvāṇa.
Can't do that if you ill-willed.

So what should you do?

But this should be done by me:
I should exert with firm exertion.
Not even when life-obstruction is being made should agitation be made.
I should not raise a frown on my face. "

You hear that final command?
They obstructing your life? Trying to kill you?
Don't even frown.

That's the bodhisattva's discipline in speech.
Deaf-mute sheep.
No frown.


## Soothing the Angry

The Bodhisattvaprātimokṣa says: ¹⁸

"Those beings who are angry—he soothes them, makes them patient, makes them conformable, satisfies them with the Dharma. "

Not reacting to anger—soothing it.


Thus ends the Ninth Chapter: The Perfection of Patience.

## Theological Notes

### The Sarvadharmasukhākrānta Samādhi
This is one of the most extraordinary teachings in Buddhist literature. The bodhisattva attains a concentration where all dharmas are pervaded by happiness. Even under torture—hands cut off, eyes plucked out, impaled alive—"the perception of pleasure alone proceeds. "

How? By aspiration. The bodhisattva's long-time aspiration: "Those who revile me, strike me, cut me, kill me—may all become attainers of the happiness of awakening. "

### The Three Patience Types
one. Enduring suffering: Non-attachment to pleasure, non-aversion to pain
two. Contemplating dharmas: Understanding emptiness and dharmatā
three. Bearing harm: Not reviling in return, not striking in return

### Hell-Bound Resolve
Trained bodhisattvas are "merchants sailing to hell"—not avoiding it but desiring it. Why? For the sake of beings. "I'm able to bear even dwelling in hell. But the Buddha-dharmas are not to be abandoned. "

### The Six Perfections from Torture
When the body is being cut, all six perfections arise:
Giving: Relinquishing the body
Morality: Loving-kindness to those cutting
Patience: Enduring for their liberation
Vigor: Not abandoning omniscience-desire
Meditation: Contemplating awakening
Wisdom: Seeing body as grass-wood-wall, dream-nature
