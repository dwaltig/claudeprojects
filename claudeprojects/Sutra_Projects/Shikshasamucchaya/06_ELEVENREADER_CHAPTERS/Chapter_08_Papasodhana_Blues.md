# Chapter eight: The Laundry (Pāpaśodhana)
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Blues Vernacular Translation by William Altig


The eighth chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on how to wash out the evil through the four dharmas: confession, antidote practice, restraint-power, and refuge-power. Includes the famous confession verses and teachings on bodhicitta as the supreme cleanser.


# Getting Clean

Listen now.

You been guarding your body. Guarding your goods. Guarding your merit. ¹
Now we gotta talk about washing the dirt out.

Why you gotta get clean?

The Book says it straight:

Of one whose person is purified, enjoyment will be wholesome,
like food for embodied beings, rightly prepared, free from husk. (Kārikā seventeen)

You clean yourself? Then what you got becomes medicine. What you give becomes food.
But if you still got the dirt in you? Everything you touch gets contaminated.


## The Purified Body Feeds Beings

The Tathāgataguhya Sūtra tells a story: ²

"In great cities there are great charnel grounds, filled with hundreds of thousands of living beings. There the bodhisattva displays a great dead body. Those animals, having eaten their fill for a month, at the end of their lifespan, are reborn among the gods of the heavenly world. He becomes the cause for them up to nirvāṇa—by the complete purity of that bodhisattva's former aspiration. "

You hear that?

A purified body benefits beings even after death.

The bodhisattva made a prayer: "May those who eat my dead body for a month become happy. May they go all the way to nirvāṇa. "

The prayer worked. The aspiration came true.

Why? Because that bodhisattva's body was clean.

The Sūtra says more:

"He, empowered by the Dharma-body, does benefit for beings even by being seen. By being heard. By being touched.

Just as the physician-king Jīvaka gathered all medicines and made a girl-form composed of medicine-trees—pleasing, beautiful, well-made. She comes, goes, stands, sits, lies down. Those who come—kings, ministers, merchants—the physician-king joins them with that medicine-girl. Having joined with her, all their diseases are calmed, and they become healthy, happy, without affliction.

Just so, that bodhisattva empowered by the Dharma-body—whatever beings touch his body, women, men, boys, girls, afflicted by desire, hatred, and delusion—for them, having been touched, all afflictions are calmed, and they perceive the body as free from burning. By the complete purity of that very bodhisattva's former aspiration. "

You understand?

A clean body heals on contact. Touch it, and the afflictions calm down.

That's what purification does.


## The Danger of Staying Dirty

If you don't purify, you can't grow. The Book says:

Just as grain covered by grass withers by diseases and doesn't thrive,
so the Buddha-sprout, covered by afflictions, doesn't go to growth. (Kārikā eighteen)

The grain is there. The seed is there. But it's covered.
Grass chokes it. Disease kills it.

Same with the Buddha-seed in you.
Covered by afflictions, it can't grow.

You gotta clear the weeds. You gotta wash the dirt out.


# Part I: Four Ways to Wash the Dirt Out

## The Caturdharma Teaching

How you clean out the evil? Four ways. Four tools. Four roads.

The Caturdharma Sūtra lays it out: ³

"By four dharmas, O Maitreya, a bodhisattva overcomes evil that has been done and accumulated. Which four?

one. Condemnation-practice (vidūṣaṇā)
two. Antidote-practice (pratipakṣa)
three. Restraint-power (pratyāpatti)
four. Refuge-power (āśraya)

With a strong support, you can't be overcome by evil. "

Let me break that down:

### Tool #one: Feel the Shame (Condemnation)

You gotta condemn what you done. Feel the weight of it. Feel remorse.
Don't shrug it off. Don't excuse it.
Stand in the dirt and say, "This is dirt. "

### Tool #two: Do the Opposite (Antidote)

You done wrong? Now do right. Intense. Don't hold back.
Evil karma? Counter it with wholesome karma.
Pour the good on top of the bad until the bad drowns.

### Tool #three: Make the Vow (Restraint-Power)

Say it out loud: "I won't do that again. "
Undertake the restraint. Get the power of non-doing.
Lock the door you used to walk through.

### Tool #four: Run to the Refuge (Refuge-Power)

Go to Buddha, Dharma, Saṅgha. Don't let go of bodhicitta.
Grab onto something stronger than your dirt.

"With a strong support, evil can't overcome you. "

You got that? Four tools. Four ways to get clean.

Now let's go through each one.


# Part II: The Confession (Tool #one)

## Standing Before the Buddhas

How you cultivate the shame? How you stand before the Boss and confess?

The Suvarṇaprabhāsottama Sūtra gives you the words. ⁴

Listen to this confession. Every line hits:

May the Buddhas attend to me, with minds of compassion and care.
May they accept my transgression, established in the ten directions.

Whatever evil karma I've done before, most terrible—
all that I will confess, standing before those of ten powers.

Not knowing parents, not knowing Buddhas,
not knowing the wholesome—whatever evil was done by me.

Drunk with the intoxication of lordship, with the intoxication of family and enjoyments,
drunk with the intoxication of youth—whatever evil was done by me.

By ill-thought, ill-spoken, and by ill-done action,
not seeing danger—whatever evil was done by me.

By the conduct of a fool's understanding, with mind covered by ignorance,
by the power of evil companions, with mind disturbed by afflictions—
whatever evil was done by me.

By the power of play and delight, by the power of sorrow and disease,
by the fault of unsatisfied wealth—whatever evil was done by me.

By association with ignoble people, by the cause of envy and stinginess,
by the fault of guile and poverty—whatever evil was done by me.

By the power of an unsteady mind, by the power of desire and anger,
even afflicted by hunger and thirst—whatever evil was done by me.

For the sake of drink, for the sake of food, for the sake of clothes, for the cause of women,
by various affliction-torments—whatever evil was done by me.

The evil of body, speech, and mind, the threefold misconduct accumulated—
whatever was done, all that I confess.

Whatever disrespect toward Buddhas, Dharma, Śrāvakas,
Pratyekabuddhas, Bodhisattvas, Dharma-preachers—
all that I confess.

If the True Dharma was rejected by me, always not knowing,
disrespect toward parents—all that I confess.

By foolishness, by childishness, covered by pride and arrogance,
by desire, hatred, and delusion—all that I confess.

May the Buddhas look upon me, with minds of attention.
May they accept my transgression, with minds offered to compassion.

Whatever evil was done before by me, in hundreds of kalpas,
on account of that I'm sorrowful-minded, pitiful, tormented by fear.

I fear the evil karma, constantly with a despairing mind.
Wherever I'll go, there's no power for me anywhere.

All Buddhas are compassionate, all are removers of fear in the world.
May they accept my transgression and release me from fear.

May the Tathāgatas wash away the fruit of affliction and karma for me.
May the Buddhas bathe me with the waters of the river of compassion.

All evil I confess, whatever was done before by me.
Whatever evil is mine now—all that I confess.

For the future, I undertake restraint from all evil actions.
I don't hide that evil, whatever misconduct may have been mine.

The threefold bodily karma, and the fourfold of speech,
by three kinds from mind—all that I confess.

Done by body, done by speech, and thought by mind,
the tenfold karma done—all that I confess.


## You Hear That?

Every kind of evil. Every cause. Every excuse.

Drunk on power. Drunk on youth. Drunk on money.
Evil friends. Weak mind. Hunger. Lust. Anger.
Poverty. Pride. Ignorance. Delusion.

All of it confessed. Nothing hidden. Nothing covered up.

You stand before the Buddhas—the ten directions, the ten powers—
and you lay it all out.

Not knowing better? Confess it.
Knowing better but doing it anyway? Confess it.
Body misconduct? Confess it.
Speech misconduct? Confess it.
Mind misconduct? Confess it.

Everything. Comprehensive. Nothing held back.

And the prayer at the end:

May the Tathāgatas wash away the fruit of affliction and karma for me.
May the Buddhas bathe me with the waters of the river of compassion.

That's the Laundry. That's getting clean.


# Part III: Hatred versus Desire (The Upāli Teaching)

## The Heavy Offense and the Light Offense

Now the Upāliparipṛcchā drops something radical. ⁵ Listen close:

"If a bodhisattva set out in the Mahāyāna should incur offenses connected with desire equal to the sands of the Ganges, and should incur a single offense connected with hatred—this latter is a heavier offense.

Why? Hatred conduces to the abandonment of beings. Desire conduces to the gathering of beings.

With regard to the affliction that gathers beings—there the bodhisattva has no deception, no fear. . .

Therefore, whatever offenses are connected with desire—all those I call non-offenses. "

You hear that?

A thousand offenses tied to desire.
One offense tied to hatred.

The one hatred-offense is heavier than all the desire-offenses combined.

Why?

Hatred abandons beings. Desire gathers beings.

You break the vow out of lust? You still holding onto beings.
You break the vow out of hate? You letting them go. You abandoning them.

For a bodhisattva, abandonment is the cardinal sin.

So the teaching says:

"Whatever offenses are connected with desire—all those I call non-offenses. "

You understand? The rules change for the bodhisattva. Different game.


## Who's Skillful in Means?

The Sūtra continues:

"Bodhisattvas who are unskillful in means fear offenses connected with desire. But bodhisattvas who are skillful in means fear offenses connected with hatred, not those connected with desire. "

Who's skillful in means?

Those restrained from abandoning beings by wisdom AND compassion together. ⁶

Not just wisdom cutting beings loose because "they're empty anyway. "
Not just compassion drowning in afflictions because "I gotta save them all. "

Wisdom and compassion holding you steady. Both. Together.

That's skillful means.

The unskillful bodhisattva fears desire-offenses.
The skillful bodhisattva fears hatred-offenses.

Because hatred abandons beings. And that's the one thing a bodhisattva can't do.


## The Jyotirmāṇavaka Story

The Upāyakauśalya Sūtra tells of Jyotirmāṇavaka, who practiced celibacy for forty-two thousand years: ⁷

A woman is desperate, on the verge of suicide. She wants him.

He walks away. Seven steps.

Then compassion arises:

"Even if I, having broken this vow, would be destined for hell—still I'm able to experience hellish suffering. And may this woman be happy. May she not make an end of herself. "

So Jyotirmāṇavaka turns back. Takes the woman by the right hand. Says:

"Rise, O beautiful one. I'll do whatever you wish. "

The Buddha comments:

"And I, by a great-compassion-mind-arising, though urgent, connected with desire, turned back for ten thousand kalpas.

See: what for others is karma conducing to hell, for the bodhisattva skillful in means is karma conducing to rising in a Brahma-world. "

You hear what I'm saying?

Breaking the vow out of compassion doesn't lead to hell—it leads to Brahma-world.

Because the motive was gathering beings, not abandoning beings.

That's the difference.


## The Teaching Summarized

Later in the same Sūtra:

"If a bodhisattva, for the sake of a single being's wholesome root, should incur an offense by which he'd burn in hell for a hundred thousand kalpas—he should undergo that offense. He should undergo that hellish suffering. He should not abandon that single being's wholesome root. "

You understand?

Don't abandon beings. Even if it means hell.

That's the bodhisattva vow. That's the line you don't cross.

Desire-offenses? They gather beings.
Hatred-offenses? They abandon beings.

Fear the abandonment. Don't fear the desire.


## The Advantage of Desire

The Upāyakauśalya Sūtra says more about the bodhisattva Priyaṃkara:

A woman is obsessed with him. Can't stop thinking about him.

The Buddha says:

Whoever woman should look at Priyaṃkara again and again with an attached mind,
she, having abandoned the female state, becomes a man of noble character.

And then:

See, O Ānanda, such qualities—by which other beings go to hell,
by that very thing, having produced desire in the heroes, they go to heaven and obtain manhood itself.

Who would produce hatred toward the bodhisattvas, great in fame, Medicine Kings,
whose even affliction is a giver of happiness? What then of one who would honor them?

You hear that?

Even affliction, if it gathers beings toward the bodhisattva, gives happiness.

What leads others to hell, in the bodhisattva's case leads to heaven.


## The Real Sin: Hatred

So the Upāliparipṛcchā concludes:

"Therefore, hatred should not be given an opening. For bodhisattvas, O Śāriputra, there are two great-offense transgressions: hatred-accompanied and delusion-accompanied.

Hatred-offense should be confessed in the presence of ten, as a heavy offense. Even a single angry thought toward one or two persons—that's heavy. "

Five immediate-retribution offenses? Confess them.
Hatred toward a single being? Confess that too. Heavy.

Why?

Because hatred abandons beings. And abandonment is the cardinal sin.


# Part IV: The Antidote (Tool #two)

## Profound Sūtras Exhaust Evil

By familiarity with profound sūtras, evil is exhausted. The Vajracchedikā says: ⁸

"Whatever sons or daughters of good family will take up these sūtras—they'll be despised, greatly despised. Why? Whatever karma of those beings done in former births, conducing to bad destinies—by that state of being despised, in this very life they'll exhaust it, and will attain Buddha-awakening. "

You study the deep teaching? People gonna despise you.

But that despising exhausts your evil karma.

What would have sent you to bad destinies—burned out in this life by being despised.

That's the antidote. That's the medicine.

Study the Dharma intensely, and the karma burns off.


## Emptiness Purifies Everything

By intent on emptiness, too, purification of evil occurs. The Tathāgatakoṣa Sūtra: ⁹

Listen to this list. This is the ten extreme evils:

"Even if a single being were endowed with:

Killing a Pratyekabuddha father
Stealing Three Jewels property
Sexual misconduct with an arhat mother
Slandering the Tathāgata
Disparaging the Saṅgha
Reviling Noble Ones
Distracting Dharma-seekers
Dragging others into immediate-retribution crimes
Coveting the gains of the rightly-going
Holding the entangled-view

If he should enter the Tathāgata's Dharma-teaching:

'There's no self here, no being, no person who acts or experiences. Uncreated, uncompounded, dream-nature, naturally luminous, originally pure'—

I don't say that being goes to bad destinies. "

You hear what I'm saying?

The worst evil. Father-killing. Mother-defiling. Buddha-slandering. Sangha-disparaging.
All ten extreme evils.

But if that person enters the emptiness-teaching—hears the truth about no-self, no agent, dream-nature, original purity—

He doesn't go to bad destinies.

The truth sets you free. Emptiness purifies what seems impossible to purify.


## Mantras and Dhāraṇīs

The Trisamayarāja teaches: ¹⁰

"Closing the eyes, with mind focused on Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, recite the hundred-syllable mantra eight thousand times. With eyes closed, you see Buddhas and Bodhisattvas; you become free from evil. "

Recite the mantra. See the Buddhas. Evil gone.


## Dream-Signs of Purification

The Cundā Dhāraṇī teaches you'll know evil is exhausted when you see signs in dreams: ¹¹

Listen to what purification looks like when you're sleeping:

Weeping, shelter, eating yogurt or milk
Vomiting
Seeing sun and moon
Traveling through space
Defeating blazing fire, black buffalo, black man
Seeing monks and nuns
Ascending a milk-tree, mountain, lion-throne, palace, or ship
Hearing the Dharma

When you see these dream-signs, evil is exhausted.

The dirt is out. The stain is gone.


## The Medicine Buddha's Power

The Bhaiṣajyaguru Sūtra: ¹²

"Those who hold the five training-precepts, the ten, the bodhisattva-vow of four hundred, the monks' two hundred fifty, the nuns' five hundred—and those who've fallen from some precept—if those, afraid of bad-destiny fear, should hold the name of that Blessed One, the Tathāgata Bhaiṣajyaguru Vaidūryaprabharāja, and should worship according to their capacity—no going to bad destinies is to be expected for them ever again. "

You broke a precept? You afraid you going to hell?

Hold the Medicine Buddha's name. Worship him.

No bad destinies. Ever again.

That's his power. That's his vow.


# Part V: Restraint-Power (Tool #three)

## The Wheel That Crushes

The Kṣitigarbha Sūtra teaches the ten wholesome karma-paths: ¹³

"A bodhisattva, having refrained from taking life, gives fearlessness to all beings. By that root of virtue, whatever karma-obstruction, affliction-obstruction, dharma-obstruction was done by taking life—all that he crushes by the wheel of refraining. "

You hear how it works?

You quit killing? You crush the killing-obstruction.
You quit stealing? You crush the stealing-obstruction.
You quit lying? You crush the lying-obstruction.

Each wholesome path is a wheel. And that wheel runs over the evil you done.

Ten wholesome paths. Ten wheels. Each one crushing its opposite.

That's restraint-power. That's the vow holding you up.


# Part VI: Refuge-Power (Tool #four)

## Run to the Boss

The Pig-Story is cited: ¹⁴

Those who go to the Buddha for refuge don't go to bad destinies.
Having abandoned human bodies, they obtain divine bodies.

You run to Buddha, Dharma, Saṅgha for refuge?

You got support. You got power. Evil can't touch you.

Go to the Triple Gem. Don't let go of bodhicitta.

That's āśraya-bala—support-power.

Grab onto something stronger than your dirt.


# Part VII: Bodhicitta—The Supreme Cleanser

## The Maitreyavimokṣa Teaching

The Maitreyavimokṣa teaches: Bodhicitta is the supreme purifier. ¹⁵

Listen to what bodhicitta does:

### Bodhicitta Is Fire

"Like a kalpa-end fire, by burning all misconduct.
Like the netherworld, by consuming all unwholesome dharmas. "

It burns. It consumes. Nothing survives that fire.


### Bodhicitta Is Gold

The Book says there's a gold-substance called Hāṭakaprabhāsa:

"One pala of it makes a thousand iron palas into gold, and that pala can't be consumed by those thousand iron palas, can't be made into iron. "

Just so:

"A single omniscience-mind-arising substance, held by the knowledge of dedicating roots of virtue, consuming all karma-and-affliction-obstruction-iron, makes all dharmas into the color of omniscience. And the omniscience-mind-arising substance can't be afflicted or consumed by all karma-affliction-iron. "

You hear that?

Bodhicitta turns iron into gold.

A little bit of gold transforms a thousand pounds of iron.
And the gold don't get corrupted by the iron.

The gold changes the iron. The iron can't change the gold.

That's bodhicitta-power.


### Bodhicitta Is a Lamp

"Just as a single lamp, in whatever house or cave it's brought, even darkness accumulated for a thousand years it dispels, and makes light—

Just so, a single omniscience-mind-arising-lamp, in whatever being's thicket of ignorance-darkness it's brought—it dispels even karma-affliction-obstruction-darkness accumulated for ineffable hundred thousand kalpas, and makes the light of knowledge. "

A thousand years of darkness.

One lamp walks in.

The darkness is gone.

Not gradually. Not slowly.

Instantly. The lamp dispels a thousand years' darkness in one moment.

That's bodhicitta. That's the Waking-Up Heart.


### Bodhicitta Is a Jewel-Crown

"Just as for great nāga-kings crowned with the wish-fulfilling-jewel-king-diadem, there's no fear of attack from others—

Just so, for bodhisattvas crowned with the bodhicitta-great-compassion-wish-fulfilling-jewel-king-diadem, there's no fear of attack from bad destinies. "

You wear the jewel-crown?

Nothing can touch you. No attack. No fear.

Hell can't reach you. Bad destinies can't reach you.

The jewel-crown protects from everything.


## The Teaching Summarized

You understand now?

Bodhicitta is fire—burns all misconduct.
Bodhicitta is gold—transforms all iron into gold.
Bodhicitta is a lamp—dispels a thousand years' darkness.
Bodhicitta is a jewel-crown—protects from all attack.

That's the supreme purifier. That's the cleanser that cleans everything.


## The Bodhisattva's Boundless Morality

The Upāliparipṛcchā adds: ¹⁶

"If a bodhisattva set out in the Mahāyāna—if he should incur an offense in the morning, and in the midday should dwell not separated from the omniscience-mind—the bodhisattva's morality-aggregate is boundless.

If he should incur an offense in the midday, and in the evening should be not separated from the omniscience-mind—the bodhisattva's morality-aggregate is boundless.

Thus the procedure for each watch.

The bodhisattva shouldn't generate excessive remorse, shouldn't be excessively regretful.

But if a Śrāvaka-vehicle person should incur offense again and again—the morality-aggregate of that Śrāvaka person is destroyed. "

You hear the difference?

Bodhisattva:
Falls in the morning
Gets up in the midday, holds bodhicitta
Morality is boundless

Śrāvaka:
Falls again and again
Morality is destroyed

What's the difference?

Bodhicitta.

The bodhisattva holds the Waking-Up Heart. Doesn't let go of omniscience-mind.
Falls? Gets back up. Holds bodhicitta.
Morality remains boundless.

The Śrāvaka? No bodhicitta. Falls? Stays down.
Morality destroyed.


## Don't Generate Excessive Remorse

The teaching says:

"The bodhisattva shouldn't generate excessive remorse, shouldn't be excessively regretful. "

You fell? Confess it. Get back up. Hold bodhicitta.

Don't drown in the shame. Don't wallow in the guilt.

Confession, yes. Despair, no.

Get clean. Hold the Waking-Up Heart. Keep moving.

That's boundless morality. That's the power of bodhicitta.


Thus ends the Eighth Chapter: The Laundry.

¹⁶ Upāliparipṛcchā: Bodhisattva's morality is boundless if not separated from omniscience-mind (bodhicitta)—can fall in morning, rise in midday, morality remains boundless. Śrāvaka's morality destroyed by repeated offense. Bodhisattva shouldn't generate excessive remorse.


## Theological Notes

### The Four Dharmas Structure

This chapter's framework is the four dharmas from the Caturdharma Sūtra:

one. Condemnation (vidūṣaṇā): Feel remorse, stand in the dirt and call it dirt
two. Antidote (pratipakṣa): Do wholesome karma intensely—profound sūtras, emptiness, mantras
three. Restraint (pratyāpatti): Undertake the vow of non-doing—ten wholesome paths as wheels crushing obstructions
four. Refuge (āśraya): Buddha, Dharma, Saṅgha, bodhicitta as strong support

These four together overcome any evil. The chapter follows this structure precisely.


### Hatred versus Desire: The Radical Teaching

The Upāli teaching is radical in Buddhist ethics: desire-offenses are lighter than hatred-offenses.

Why? The bodhisattva's mission is gathering beings, not abandoning them.

Desire gathers beings (even if afflicted)
Hatred abandons beings (the cardinal sin)

Therefore:
Skillful bodhisattvas fear hatred-offenses, not desire-offenses
Breaking vows out of compassion (Jyotirmāṇavaka story) leads to Brahma-world, not hell
The motive determines the destination

This teaching is grounded in wisdom AND compassion together—not just wisdom cutting beings loose ("they're empty anyway") or just compassion drowning in afflictions.


### Emptiness Purifies the Unpurifiable

The Tathāgatakoṣa teaching: even the ten extreme evils are purified by entering the emptiness-teaching.

This is one of the most dramatic claims in the text: father-killing, mother-defiling, Buddha-slandering—all purified by no-self understanding.

The mechanism: understanding uncreated, uncompounded, dream-nature, natural luminosity, original purity.

The truth sets you free. Not by magic, but by seeing through the agent who did the deed.


### Bodhicitta as Supreme Purifier

The Maitreyavimokṣa teaching places bodhicitta above all other purifiers. Four metaphors:

one. Fire: Burns all misconduct, consumes all unwholesome dharmas
two. Gold (Hāṭakaprabhāsa): One pala transforms thousand iron palas; iron can't corrupt the gold
three. Lamp: Dispels thousand years' darkness instantly
four. Jewel-Crown: Protects from all attack, all bad destinies

The key teaching: If you hold bodhicitta, even offenses don't destroy your morality—it remains boundless.

Bodhisattva: Falls → Holds bodhicitta → Morality boundless
Śrāvaka: Falls repeatedly → No bodhicitta → Morality destroyed

The difference is the Waking-Up Heart.


### The Laundry Metaphor

This chapter's root metaphor: The Laundry—washing out stains, getting clean, scrubbing the dirt.

Four tools for cleaning:
one. Confession—standing in the dirt and naming it
two. Antidote—pouring good on top of bad until bad drowns
three. Restraint—locking the door you used to walk through
four. Refuge—grabbing onto something stronger than your dirt

And the supreme cleanser: bodhicitta—fire, gold, lamp, jewel-crown.

The purified body becomes medicine that heals on contact.
