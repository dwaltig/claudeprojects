# Chapter seven: The Low Road (Bhogapuṇyarakṣā)
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Blues Vernacular Translation by William Altig


The seventh chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on protecting what you got by going down low—guarding your goods, guarding your merit, bowing to everyone, taking the servant's path, and finding freedom in the dirt.


# Part I: Guard What You Got (Bhogarakṣā)

## You Gotta Know the Measure

So we talked about protecting your body. ¹ Now we gotta talk about protecting your goods.

Here's the word: ²

"The one who starts good work,
and knows measure in everything—
from this training-rule,
protecting your enjoyments ain't hard. "

The Ugra Sūtra lays down the law: ³

"Act with well-examined action.
Act with well-done action. "

That means: Look close at how you use your goods.
Don't throw 'em away careless.
Don't be contemptuous about it.
Know the measure. Know what's needed.

By this, it's established:
Even when the job can be done with little—
don't waste much.
Not yourself. Not through others.
Don't destroy fine goods when rough ones will do.


## Use Your People Right

The same sūtra says: ⁴

"By proper use of sons, wives,
servants, workers, employees. . . "

Don't give up what you need.
Don't hold on to what blocks the waking-up.
If you got power to help beings—real power—
don't do anything that stops you from doing greater good.

For the bodhisattva with strength to serve,
letting go or holding on that blocks awakening-factors?
That ain't the way.

If you got equal power or greater power to help,
don't abandon what lets you do equal or greater wholesome deeds.

That's established.


## The Renunciant Don't Give Material (He Gives Dharma)

The Bodhisattva Code⁵ makes it crystal clear:

"Now then, Śāriputra—
the bodhisattva who left home,
engaged in awakening-factors:
How should he give? What should he give?

He should be a Dharma-giver.
A Dharma-patron.

Listen: If a householder bodhisattva
filled Ganges-sand Buddha-fields
with seven treasures
and gave it all to the Tathāgatas—

And if a renunciant bodhisattva
illuminated just one four-line verse—

The renunciant generates far more merit.

The Tathāgata has NOT approved
material gift for the renunciant.

If gain comes into your bowl—
rightfully obtained, Dharma-obtained—
eat in common with your fellow-practitioners.

If someone comes asking for your bowl or robe,
give what's extra beyond the three robes.

But if your robe would be insufficient—
that on which the holy life depends—
don't give it up.
The Tathāgata said the three robes
are not to be given away.

If you give away all three robes
and become a beggar-beggar,
that ain't being content with little.

The one who left home?
He should serve the Dharma.
He should be engaged in that. "

The renunciant's gift is Dharma, not material.
That's the rule. That's the road.

Otherwise, what happens?
For the sake of drawing in one being,
you abandon the great crowd's welfare.
You block the bodhisattva's intention.
You create loss of great purpose.

That's called "abandoning the broad wholesome side. "
That's off the path.

So now: the prohibition against giving is stated.
What about the prohibition against not giving?

Listen: The Sāgaramati Sūtra⁶ lists this in the "obstructions to the Mahāyāna":
Too much possessing is dangerous.

But this rule—the one laid down for yourself—
must also be taught to other bodhisattvas.

How do we know?
Because it's taught in the Ugra Sūtra:
"Abandoning your own task for another's task. "

You see that? There's a balance.
Give Dharma. Don't hoard material.
But don't destroy your capacity to serve.

That's guarding your goods.


# Part II: The Chain of Going Down

## Fear of Saṃsāra → Equality → Liberation

The Vimalakīrti Sūtra⁷ gives the famous exchange.
Listen to the call and response:

Vimalakīrti asks:

"What should one afraid of saṃsāra resort to? "

Mañjuśrī answers:

"The greatness of the Buddha. "

"Where should one wishing to stand
in the greatness of the Buddha stand? "

"In equality with all beings. "

"Where should one wishing to stand
in equality with all beings stand? "

"For the liberation of all beings. "

You hear that chain?

Fear → Greatness → Equality → Liberation.

That's The Low Road.
You start scared.
You reach for the Big Boss.
You find equality—no high, no low.
You work for everyone's freedom.

Not yours first. Everyone's.


## Awakening First for All Beings

The Dharmasaṃgīti Sūtra⁸ says it plain:

"Whatever bodhisattva wishes for enlightenment
FIRST for all beings, not for himself—
that's the Dharma-assembly. "

From the very act of giving all to beings,
the absence of self-interest is established.

But listen: This don't mean you neglect beings' welfare.
You don't place your burden on someone unfit to carry it.

Where you see no harm to beings' welfare?
There, whether you do it or another does it—
what's the difference?

All that matters is the world's benefit.

Now, if you say:
"I won't give up my own wholesome deeds
for another bodhisattva's wholesome success"—

Then you're scared of your own bad rebirth, your own suffering.

But look: The second person got the same suffering.

If you say:
"Well, their suffering don't bother me"—

Then you're in violation of the sūtras.

The Ratnakūṭa Sūtra⁹ calls out the fakes:

"These four are bodhisattva-imitations:
. . . The one seeking his own happiness,
not seeking to remove all beings' suffering. "

That's the fake.

So by the rule of the Ugra Sūtra,
just like before:
Blame yourself. Serve others.

This is the bodhisattva training
taught in the Nirārambha Dharmasaṃgīti Sūtra: ¹⁰

"How should they be known
as established in practice? "

"When they don't go against beings. "

"How do they not go against beings? "

"When they don't abandon
loving-kindness and great compassion. "

Subhūti asks:

"What is the bodhisattvas' great loving-kindness? "

"When they bring out
their body, their life, all their wholesome roots
for all beings—
and they don't expect anything back. "

"What is the bodhisattvas' great compassion? "

"When they wish awakening
FIRST for beings, not for themselves. "

And it says right there:

"All bodhisattva training
has great compassion as its root. "

Now, the Blessed One wouldn't prohibit this
without reason.

He's definitely pointing toward some purpose—
one bodhisattva's purpose.

Why? Because we see:
From the giver's great merit-field,
from the great gift to the great receiver,
comes a great ocean of merit.

Otherwise, it would just be
the destruction of obstacles. Death.

As the Praśāntaviniścayaprātihārya Sūtra¹¹ teaches:

"That expenditure, Great King,
that you made over a hundred thousand years—
all of it combined
would be the daily food of one monk.
And so for each monk, one by one.

But a bodhisattva
engaged in recitation and study,
with reverence, desiring Dharma,
accepting an offering of faith-food—
if he generates this thought:
'I'll obtain the quest for Dharma by this'—

His wholesome deed,
that gift-dharma abandonment,
doesn't reach even a hundredth part
of not-a-hundredth part. "

That's said for the purity of home-happiness.
But by the rule stated before,
there's no fault.

So that's the summary of protecting enjoyments.


# Part III: Protecting Your Merit (Puṇyarakṣā)

## Free from Self-Craving

Now: protecting enjoyments has been stated.
Time to speak on protecting merit.

Here's the word: ¹²

"By freedom from craving
for the ripening of self-interest,
merit is well-protected. "

The Nārāyaṇa Sūtra¹³ lays it out:

"He doesn't protect morality for his own sake—
not for heaven,
not for Śakra-hood,
not for enjoyments,
not for power,
not for form,
not for beauty,
not for fame.

Not afraid of hell does he protect morality.
Not afraid of animal birth. . .

Rather, he protects morality
for establishing the Buddha-guidance,
seeking the welfare, benefit, happiness, and security
of ALL beings. "

And a bodhisattva equipped
with this kind of morality-aggregate?

He doesn't fall away from ten dharmas.
What ten?

He doesn't fall away from wheel-turning sovereignty.
And in that, he's heedful, waiting for awakening, waiting to see the Buddha.

He doesn't fall away from Brahma-hood, from seeing Śuddha, from obtaining Edya,
from hearing Dharma. . .

All the way to:

He doesn't fall away from accepting the bodhisattva restraint,
for accomplishing practice according to what's heard.

He doesn't fall away from uncut eloquence,
from aspiration for all wholesome dharmas,
from meditation.

And a bodhisattva-mahāsattva established in this morality-aggregate?

He's always honored by gods.
Always praised by nāgas.
Always honored by yakṣas.
Always worshiped by gandharvas.
Always revered by nāga-lords and asura-lords.
Always highly regarded by brahmins, kṣatriyas, guild-chiefs, householders.
Always approached by the wise.
Always accompanied by Buddhas.
Approved by the Teacher of the world with its gods.
Compassionate toward all beings.

And he doesn't go to four destinies.
What four?

He doesn't go to untimely death (except for ripening beings).
He doesn't go to a Buddha-less Buddha-field.
He doesn't go to birth in a wrong-view family.
He doesn't go to any bad destination.

That's what morality protected for beings' sake gets you.


## Even Given-Away Merit Needs Guarding

So even merit that was given away before—
if it's being taken back under the power of defilement,
it needs protecting.

Even from merit-giving itself—
from that merit,
don't wish for the ripening
except for others' welfare.

And one wishing to protect merit: ¹⁴

"Should not create regret afterward. "

As the Ugra Sūtra says:

"Having given, don't generate a regretful mind. "

Why? Because subsequent weakness comes from prior weakness.

From regret, even merit gets exhausted like evil.
That's the intention.


## Don't Proclaim Your Good Deeds

"And having done, should not make it public. "

The Blessed One praised in many ways:
"Concealed good, revealed evil. "¹⁵

What you reveal gets exhausted.
Evil: exhausted by sorrow.
Merit: exhausted by elation.

Exception: No offense for one who publicizes for beings' sake,
with no bait, no hook.

As the Ratnamegha¹⁶ illustrates with the doctor-example:
Self-exaltation is faultless in that case.

But again, one wishing to protect merit—


# Part IV: The Three Fears (What Drains Your Merit)

## Fear Gain and Honor, Avoid Exaltation

Here's the teaching: ¹⁷

"Should be afraid of gain and honor,
should always avoid exaltation;
the bodhisattva should be serene,
should abandon doubt in the Dharma. "

The Ratnakūṭa Sūtra¹⁸ lists four dharmas:

When a bodhisattva is equipped with these four,
his arisen wholesome dharmas diminish.
They don't increase.

What four?

one. The conceited one's quest for worldly philosophy (lokāyata)
two. One intent on gain and honor, looking at families (sizing up who's got wealth)
three. Hatred-accusation of bodhisattvas
four. Rejection of unheard sūtras (rejecting teachings you ain't heard before)

That's how your wholesome dharmas get drained.


## Ill-Will Destroys Kalpas of Merit

The Sarvāstivāda Vinaya¹⁹ tells the story:

Listen up. A monk prostrated at the stūpa of hair and nails,
generating great faith.

The Blessed One said:

"As much earth as he touched—
down eighty thousand yojanas to the golden wheel—
as many sand-grains as there are,
so many thousands of wheel-turning sovereignties
will be enjoyed by this monk. "

Upāli asked:

"Where do these roots of virtue get exhausted? "

The Blessed One said:

"Upāli, I don't see such diminution
as when a fellow-practitioner
generates an ill mind
toward a fellow-practitioner.

There these roots of virtue
become thin, exhausted. "

Then he said:

"Therefore, Upāli, train thus:
'We won't corrupt our minds
even toward a BURNT POST—
how much less toward a body possessing consciousness. '"

Even a burnt post. Even a charred stump.
Don't send bad thoughts toward it.
How much more toward a living being?

The Mañjuśrīvikrīḍita Sūtra²⁰ adds:

"'Opposition, opposition'—
it destroys roots of virtue
accumulated over a hundred kalpas;
therefore it's called 'opposition' (pratigha). "

You hear that?
One flash of ill-will—one moment of opposition—
destroys a hundred kalpas of merit.

The Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra²¹ says:

"Through that unwholesome root
arisen from mutual contempt,
they fall away even from life-span.
They fall away from beauty, strength, ease. "

And here, to show that exaltation should never be done,
it says always: "always avoid. "


## When Gain May Be Accepted (But Not for Yourself)

Now, gain and honor are sometimes accepted.

The Ratnamegha Sūtra²² says:

"Here, son of the family,
a bodhisattva,
even receiving a Sumeru-sized heap of jewels,
accepts it.
Even receiving a small, contemptible thing—
he accepts it.

Why?

He thinks this way:
'These beings are stingy. Greedy.
Overpowered by greed.
Because of that, that cause, that condition,
they're drowning in the ocean of saṃsāra,
sinking and surfacing.

'This will be for their long-term welfare,
their benefit, their happiness. '

Having accepted everything,
he DOESN'T MAKE IT HIS OWN.

He doesn't generate a greedy mind.

Rather, he makes an offering
to Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha
in common with all beings.

He makes it a means of livelihood
for suffering beings.

And he encourages and delights that patron. "

And then it says:

"And by that gift
he is NOT EXALTED. "

Then it says again:

"If, from that cause, condition, source,
fame, reputation, renown arise for him—
he doesn't become one born to conceit,
born to pride, born to intoxication.

He thinks this way:
'Before long,
that which this fame-reputation-renown was raised for,
and the fame-reputation-renown itself—
all three of these
will be entirely non-existent.

'What wise-born person
would generate a fawning mind
toward impermanent, unstable, unreliable, untrustworthy dharmas?
Would become exalted, prideful, intoxicated? '

Thus the bodhisattva dwells
with well-established mindfulness
regarding gain, honor, fame, reputation, renown. "


# Part V: Going Down Low (The Eleven Forms)

## Like a Corpse, Like an Outcaste, Like a Bowl-Liver

Then it says: ²³

"And they dwell in the world
like an outcaste youth (caṇḍālakumāra),
with a low, low mind.

They've let go of pride-intoxication-arrogance.

Because of the constantly-present perception
of slander. "

Then it says again:

"Here, son of the family,
the bodhisattva who left home,
who went forth:

Strike down pride by thinking:

one. "I'm like a CORPSE to friends, relatives, kin. "
   —Pride struck down.

two. "Disfigurement has arisen for me.
   Discolored garments are worn by me. "
   —Pride struck down.

three. "Shaved head, bowl in hand,
   I go from family to family for alms,
   for the sake of begging, for the cause of begging. "
   —Pride struck down.

four. "With a LOW, LOW MIND,
   like an outcaste youth,
   I go for alms. "
   —Pride struck down.

five. "I've become a BOWL-LIVER.
   My livelihood depends on others. "
   —Pride struck down.

six. "I accept what's cast off, what's disdained. "
   —Pride struck down.

seven. "My teachers, masters, venerable ones
   are to be pleased. "
   —Pride struck down.

eight. "My fellow-practitioners are to be satisfied—
   by this conduct, this range, this practice. "
   —Pride struck down.

nine. "I shall attain unobtained Buddha-dharmas. "
   —Pride struck down.

ten. "Among angry, malicious beings,
    I shall dwell abounding in patience. "
    —Pride struck down.

You see that?
Corpse-like. Outcaste-like. Bowl-liver.
Feet in the dirt.

That's The Low Road.


## Perfect Body, Bowing Mind

The Sāgaramati Sūtra²⁴ adds:

"He's purified in body.
His limbs adorned with the marks,
his hands and feet soft and tender,
his body well-divided by the flow of merit,
his faculties unimpaired,
all his limbs and parts complete.

Yet he's not intoxicated by form.
He's not devoted to adorning the body.

Even to beings who are lowly,
to beings deformed in appearance—
he bows down, he prostrates,
taking them up for Dharma-receptivity. "

Then it says again:

"Just as the great ocean settles
in a low place of earth—
because of its lowness,
all rivers and all streams
flow into it with little difficulty.

Just so, Blessed One:
For the non-prideful bodhisattva
who has reverence and respect for teachers—
with little difficulty,
those profound Dharma-joys
come to the ear-faculty.
They abide in memory.

Therefore, Blessed One:
Whatever bodhisattva is exalted by pride,
stiffened by pride,
who doesn't bow down to the venerable,
who doesn't prostrate—

You should know, Blessed One:
'This bodhisattva is pierced by Māra's hook. '"

Pride stiffens you.
Humility makes you low.
And low is where the water flows.
Low is where the Dharma comes.


# Part VI: The Ten Māra-Works (What Blocks the Way)

## Disrespect, Not Bowing, Conceit

The Lokottaraparivarta Sūtra²⁵ teaches:

"These ten, O sons of the Jina,
are the Māra-works of bodhisattvas.

What ten?

one. Lack of reverence
toward teachers, venerable ones, ācāryas, mother, father, śramaṇas, brāhmaṇas,
those rightly gone, rightly practicing.
—Māra-work.

two. Not bowing down to Dharma-preachers
who have attained distinguished Dharma,
who preach vast Dharma,
who have mounted the Mahāyāna,
who know the path-method to nirvāṇa,
who have obtained dhāraṇī and sūtra-sovereignty.

Being arrogant and stiff.
Not generating reverence, service, honor toward the Dharma-preacher.

While listening to Dharma, while sitting in conversation—
when a surge of vast Dharma arises from the Dharma-preacher—
not giving applause: "May no one praise him. "
—Māra-work.

three. Generating conceit,
grasping oneself, not grasping others.
Not descending to self-knowledge.
Not generating mental application.
—Māra-work.

four. Generating pride,
not knowing, not understanding—
concealing the praise of praiseworthy persons.
Speaking their dispraise.
Not delighted by others' excellence-praise.
—Māra-work.

five. Knowing
"This is Dharma, this is Vinaya, this is the Buddha's word"—
yet making Dharma-hatred because of person-hatred.
Rejecting the True Dharma.
Causing others to quarrel.
—Māra-work.

six. Seeking high status.
Not rising for elders, long-practiced in the holy life.
Not going forth to meet them.
—Māra-work.

seven. Being frown-faced, not smile-faced.
Not gentle-harsh-kind-worded.
Always hard-minded, fault-seeking, flaw-watching.
—Māra-work.

eight. Having fallen into conceit,
not approaching the wise.
Not serving them, not attending them, not waiting on them.
Not asking, not inquiring:

*"What is wholesome? What is unwholesome?
What should be done? What, done, will be for long-term welfare, benefit, happiness?
What, not done, will be for long-term non-welfare, non-benefit, suffering? "*

Being dull. Becoming duller.
Covered by delusion, grasped by pride.
Seeing no escape.
—Māra-work.

nine. Overpowered by pride,
disgusted with Buddha-arising.
Exhausting former wholesome roots.
Not raising new ones.
Teaching what should not be taught.
Initiating quarrels, abounding in disputes.

One dwelling in dharma this way—
it's possible he'll fall down the great precipice of wrong (views).

Or, by the power of his bodhicitta-strength,
by a marvel-favor,
he regains it.

But for a hundred thousand kalpas
he won't meet Buddha-arising.
How much less hear Dharma?

This is the tenth Māra-work.

These, O sons of the Jina,
are the ten Māra-works.

Having abandoned these,
bodhisattvas obtain ten knowledge-works.

And here, in these knowledge-works,
they mature:

Non-pride toward all beings. "

There it is. The antidote.
Non-pride toward all beings.
Going down. Staying low.


## The Price of Pride

The Rāṣṭrapāla Sūtra²⁶ sings the blues:

"Going to the destinationless realms,
to untimely places,
to poverty,
to low-family birth,
to birth-blindness, weakness, short-lifespan—
they grasp these,
the deluded ones,
by the power of pride. "

That's what pride gets you.
Poverty. Blindness. Low birth. Death.


# Part VII: The Being-Field (All Beings Are Your Field)

## Beings = Buddha-Field

The Dharmasaṃgīti Sūtra²⁷ says:

"The being-field
is the bodhisattva's buddha-field.

Because from the buddha-field
comes the acquisition of Buddha-dharmas.

I'm not fit to err regarding it.

He thinks this way:
'All good conduct and bad conduct
proceed depending on beings.
From bad conduct: bad destinies.
From good conduct: gods and humans. '"

So the Ratnolkā Dhāraṇī²⁸ teaches:

"Here, O sons of the Jina,
the bodhisattva who has generated
the first thought (of awakening)—
from the very beginning,
toward all beings,
generates mind in ten ways.

What ten?

one. Welfare-mind
two. Happiness-mind
three. Nurse-mind (dāyā — wet-nurse, caretaker)
four. Affectionate-mind (snigdha — tender, loving)
five. Dear-mind (priya — beloved)
six. Assistance-mind (anugraha — favor, help)
seven. Protection-mind (ārakṣā)
eight. Equal-mind (sama — equality)
nine. Ācārya-mind (teacher-mind)
ten. Śāstṛ-mind (master-mind)

"He generates mind in these ten ways. "

That's how you look at beings.
Parent. Child. Nurse. Teacher. Master.
All of it. Everyone.


## Student of All Beings

The Śraddhābalādhānāvatāramudrā Sūtra²⁹ says:

"I'm established
in being a student of all beings.

And I shall establish others
in being students of all beings.

I'll receive assurance of that.

(Many details. . . )

I'm established
in bowing and prostrating to all beings. "

And likewise before.

So right there, in bowing-prostrating to all beings:
Non-pride toward all beings.

The Vimalakīrtinirdeśa³⁰ says:

For the arising of a purified buddha-field,
teacher-love toward all beings is taught.

For the sake of pleasing the world, guarding the world,
even if you're doing the work of sweeping seats, washing feet—
toward women, toward those in untimely states, toward the fallen—
the bodhisattva should cultivate love-regard, reverence-practice.


## The King Who Loved Beggars

The Gaṇḍavyūha³¹ tells the story:

When he sat on that great lion-throne,
all that crowd of people
became facing him, with joined palms,
honoring that king.

(Many details. . . )

But King Sarvadharmanirnādacchatramaṇḍalanirghoṣa—
seeing those beggars,
he was more delighted
than by seeing himself as king,
than by obtaining three-thousand-world wheel-turning sovereignty,
than by immeasurable kalpa-duration,
than by the peaceful liberation-gates of the Pure Abode gods,
than by endless kalpa-ending.

It's like a man of singular thirst-wandering nature—
separated for a long time
from mother, father, brothers, sisters,
friends, relatives, kin, sons, daughters, wife—
lost in a wilderness, in a desert—
desiring to see them.

At their seeing, their attention,
great joy, elation would arise,
insatiability at their seeing.

Just so, son of the family:
For King Sarvadharmanirnādacchatramaṇḍalanirghoṣa,
at the seeing-together of those beggars,
great surges of joy were born.
Mind-satisfaction-happiness entered.
Great surges of mind-exaltation arose.

So that toward all those beggars,
perception arose:

Only-son perception
Mother-father perception
Venerable perception
Good friend perception
Excellence perception
Rare perception
Difficult-to-do-doer perception
Great-doer perception
Supreme benefactor perception
Bodhi-path support perception
Ācārya-śāstṛ perception

You see that? The king loved the beggars
more than his own kingdom.

Because they were his field.
They were his teachers.
They were the way to awakening.


## Serve Like a Slave Serves a King

So when going to beings in another state,
when going forward, attending, and so on,
remember the total offering:

"This body of mine belongs to THEM.
Let them do as they wish with it—
like earth for sweeping, plastering, and so on,
for their own happiness. "

Or think like a slave afraid of displeasing the master,
seeking the master's favor,
intent on fulfilling the master's command.

Even the Blessed One accepted attendance.
When a sick monk had no other recourse,
the Buddha himself attended him.

As taught in the Bhikṣuprakīrṇaka: ³²

The Blessed One said:
"Don't be afraid, monk. Don't be afraid, monk.
I'll attend you, monk.
Bring your robes, monk, so I can wash them. "

When this was said,
Venerable Ānanda said to the Blessed One:

"Don't let the Blessed One wash
this sick one's impure, soiled robes.
I'll wash them, Blessed One. "

The Blessed One said:
"Then, Ānanda, you wash this monk's robes.
The Tathāgata will pour the water. "

Then Venerable Ānanda washed that sick monk's robes.
The Blessed One poured the water.

(Many details. . . )

Then Venerable Ānanda,
having well and properly taken up that sick monk,
having brought him outside, bathed him.
The Blessed One poured the water.

The Buddha poured the water for a sick monk.
That's The Low Road.


# Part VIII: The Service Verses (The Heart of the Chapter)

## Those by Whom You Attain Everything

And he says: ³³

"Those whom, having pleased,
one attains greatness;
having opposed,
one attains terrible ruin—

Is it not right to satisfy them
even by abandoning life? "

"These are those beings
by pleasing whom
many have attained success.

There is no field of success
other than beings in the world. "

"These are wish-fulfilling jewels,
good vessels,
and wish-granting cows.

Like a teacher, like a deity—
therefore they are to be pleased. "

"And what of my unending deceitless friends,
my immeasurable benefactors?

Having abandoned the pleasing of beings,
what greater repayment could there be? "

"They are to be carried on the head,
as I wish, by the Protector.

The Protector, having dwelt in the hair-matts,
carried beings with effort, unshakeable. "

"They are to be broken into in body,
entered into Avīci.
For their sake, if that's done, it's done.

Even toward great harmers,
by that, all excellence alone
should be performed toward these. "

"My very masters, after all—
for whose sake I'm indifferent even to myself—

How can I make pride toward those masters,
not servant-nature? "

"Those in whose happiness
the sage-lords go to joy,
those in whose suffering
they enter anger—

From satisfying them,
satisfaction of all sage-lords;
in harm to them,
harm done to the sages. "

"Just as one whose body
is entirely on fire—
there's no well-being from all pleasures—

So too when beings are suffering,
there's no means of joy
for the greatly compassionate. "

"And I was doing harm
to the great-hearted ones
by the suffering of beings.

I confess that evil today.
May the sages, who were wearied,
forgive me. "

"And for the sake of pleasing the Tathāgatas,
I undertake servitude to the world
with my entire being.

Let crowds of people
place their feet on my head,
or let them strike—
may the World-Protector be pleased. "

"All this world
has been made their own
by those compassionate ones—
there's no doubt about this.

These very ones are seen
in the forms of beings, aren't they?
They themselves are the Protectors—
why disrespect here? "

"This very thing
is pleasing of the Tathāgatas;
this very thing
is accomplishing one's own aim;
this very thing
removes the suffering of the world—

Therefore, may this be my vow. "

"Just as one king's man
oppresses a great crowd,
the great crowd cannot act, cannot overcome—
the long-sighted one. "

"Because he's not alone—
the king's power is his power.

So too, don't disparage
any weak one who has done wrong. "

"Because the hell-guardians
and the compassionate ones
are his power.

Therefore, please beings
like a servant pleases a cruel king. "

"What could an angry king do
by which there would be hell-suffering?
What is experienced
by beings' displeasure, done. "

"What could a pleased king give
that would equal Buddhahood?
What is experienced
by beings' pleasure, done. "

"Leave aside future Buddhahood
arisen from pleasing beings—

Don't you see right here:
Good fortune, fame, well-being? "

"Handsomeness, health,
joy, long life—
the patient one obtains
the abundant happiness of a wheel-turner,
even while transmigrating. "


## Loving-Kindness Is Greater Than All Offerings

And from that, the Candrapradīpa Sūtra³⁴ illuminates
the fruit of the loving mind:

"Whatever immeasurable worships
in hundreds of fields,
in niyutas and koṭis (billions)—

Having made that worship
of incomparable Leaders—

It doesn't reach even a fraction, a calculation
of the loving mind. "

Loving-kindness toward beings
is the greatness of beings.

Merit from Buddha-favor
is the greatness of Buddhas.

You want to worship the Buddhas?
Love beings.


# Part IX: Avoid Exaltation Forever

## The Summary of Merit-Protection

So, in this way,
toward these great venerable ones,
avoid exaltation always.

And this exaltation arises from unwise attention.

Effort must be made in its non-arising.

As the Ratnamegha³⁵ says:

"And how, son of the family,
is the bodhisattva free from unwise attention?

Here, a bodhisattva,
alone, gone to seclusion, standing in solitude,
doesn't generate mind like this:

'I dwell unmixed.
I'm established in solitude.
I've practiced in the Tathāgata's Dharma-Vinaya.

'But those other śramaṇas and brāhmaṇas—
all of them dwell mixed,
abounding in association,
fallen away from the Tathāgata's Dharma-Vinaya. '

Thus the bodhisattva is free from unwise attention. "

Then it says again:

"Here, a bodhisattva initiating vigor
doesn't taste that great vigor.
Doesn't exalt himself by that vigor.
Doesn't despise others.

He thinks this way:
'What wise-natured person,
engaged in his own work,
would also urge others on? '

Thus the bodhisattva is one of non-exalted vigor. "

No exaltation. No pride. No high.
Stay low. Always low.

That's The Low Road.


# Part X: The Summary (Dedication to Awakening)

## Merit Dedicated to Awakening Is Inexhaustible

Now this is the summary of merit-protection:
Dedication to awakening (bodhipariṇāmanā).

As taught in the Akṣayamati Sūtra: ³⁶

"There's no intermediate exhaustion
of a wholesome root dedicated to awakening,
until sitting on the seat of enlightenment.

Just as, Venerable Śāradvatīputra,
for a drop of water that's fallen into the great ocean—
there's no intermediate exhaustion
until the end of the kalpa. "

Dedicate your merit to awakening.
It becomes inexhaustible.
Like a drop in the ocean,
lasting until the kalpa ends.


Thus ends the Seventh Chapter of the Compendium of Training:
The Low Road
(Bhogapuṇyarakṣā — Protection of Enjoyments and Merit)


# Theological Notes

### The Root Metaphor: "The Low Road"

This chapter is about one thing: going down.

Going down in humility (like a corpse, an outcaste, a bowl-liver)
Going down to serve (student of all beings, feet on head)
Going down to protect (merit protected by not seeking honor)

The "Low Road" is the path of descending to serve. It's the Blues tradition of "taking the low road home"—not the high road of pride, but the low road of humility. The lower you go, the more you receive. Like the ocean settling in the lowest place, all rivers flow into it.

### The Chain: Fear → Greatness → Equality → Liberation

The Vimalakīrti exchange gives the blueprint:
one. You start scared of saṃsāra
two. You reach for the Buddha's greatness
three. You find equality with all beings
four. You work for everyone's liberation

That's The Low Road in four steps.

### The Corpse-Outcaste-Bowl-Liver Triple

The renunciant strikes down pride by seeing himself as:
Corpse-like (dead to friends and family)
Outcaste-like (lowest caste, caṇḍāla)
Bowl-liver (livelihood depends on others' bowls)

This is radical self-lowering. Not false humility—real recognition of dependence.

### Beings as Buddha-Field

The chapter's central teaching: "The being-field is the bodhisattva's buddha-field. "

Beings aren't obstacles—they're the source of Buddha-dharmas. You don't attain awakening despite beings; you attain it through beings. There is no field of success other than beings in the world.

The King Who Loved Beggars story illustrates this perfectly: The king was more delighted to see beggars than to have his kingdom. Why? Because they were his teachers, his field, his path to awakening.

### The Ten Māra-Works

This list is a self-examination for bodhisattvas:
Am I disrespectful to teachers? (Māra-work)
Do I not bow to Dharma-preachers? (Māra-work)
Am I conceited? (Māra-work)
Am I prideful? (Māra-work)
Do I hate Dharma because I hate a person? (Māra-work)
Do I seek high position? (Māra-work)
Am I frown-faced, not smile-faced? (Māra-work)
Do I not approach the wise? (Māra-work)
Am I overcome by pride? (Māra-work)
Do I exhaust old merit without raising new? (Māra-work)

The antidote to all ten? Non-pride toward all beings.

### Ill-Will Destroys Kalpas

One of the most dramatic teachings: One flash of ill-will toward a fellow-practitioner destroys a hundred kalpas of accumulated merit.

"Don't corrupt your mind even toward a burnt post—how much less toward a body possessing consciousness. "

Even a charred stump deserves respect. How much more a living being?

### Feet on Your Head

The Service Verses climax with this image:

"Let crowds of people place their feet on my head,
or let them strike—may the World-Protector be pleased. "

This is the ultimate expression of The Low Road. Not passive victimhood—active service. You offer your head for their feet because that pleases the Tathāgatas, accomplishes your own aim, and removes the world's suffering.

### Dedication to Awakening

The chapter's final teaching: Dedicate your merit to awakening, and it becomes inexhaustible—like a drop fallen into the great ocean, lasting until the end of the kalpa.

This is the summary of all merit-protection. Not holding on. Not hoarding. Dedicating it all to awakening, for all beings.

That's The Low Road.

¹ Reference to Chapter six: Protecting the body (ātmabhāvarakṣā) was the previous chapter.

² Kārikā fourteen: The verse on protecting enjoyments through knowing measure.

³ Ugraparipṛcchā: "Well-examined action, well-done action"—the rule for using goods properly.

⁴ Proper use of household: Don't block awakening-factors by giving up or holding on inappropriately.

⁵ Bodhisattvaprātimokṣa: The Bodhisattva Code's teaching that the renunciant gives Dharma, not material. A single verse surpasses Ganges-sand buddha-fields of treasure.

⁶ Sāgaramati Sūtra: Lists "too much possessing" among the obstructions to the Mahāyāna.

⁷ Vimalakīrtinirdeśa: The famous chain—fear of saṃsāra → Buddha-greatness → equality with all beings → liberation of all beings.

⁸ Dharmasaṃgīti Sūtra: "Awakening first for all beings, not for himself"—the essence of bodhisattva practice.

⁹ Ratnakūṭa Sūtra: Lists the four bodhisattva-imitations, including the one who seeks his own happiness rather than removing beings' suffering.

¹⁰ Nirārambha Dharmasaṃgīti Sūtra: Defines great loving-kindness (bringing out body, life, wholesome roots for beings without expecting return) and great compassion (wishing awakening first for beings). States that all bodhisattva training has great compassion as its root.

¹¹ Praśāntaviniścayaprātihārya Sūtra: A king's hundred-thousand-year expenditure combined equals one monk's daily food. But a bodhisattva studying Dharma who accepts an offering thinking "I'll obtain the Dharma-quest by this" generates far more merit.

¹² Kārikā 15ab: Merit is well-protected by freedom from craving for self-benefit.

¹³ Nārāyaṇaparipṛcchā: The bodhisattva doesn't protect morality for heaven, Śakra-hood, power, beauty, fame—not afraid of hell or animal birth—but for establishing the Buddha-guidance and the welfare of all beings.

¹⁴ Kārikā 15c: "Should not create regret afterward. "

¹⁵ Pracchannakalyāṇatā: "Concealed good, revealed evil"—the Blessed One's praise. What you reveal gets exhausted (evil by sorrow, merit by elation).

¹⁶ Ratnamegha: Illustrates with doctor-example that self-exaltation is faultless when done for beings' sake.

¹⁷ Kārikā sixteen: "Should be afraid of gain and honor, should always avoid exaltation; the bodhisattva should be serene, should abandon doubt in the Dharma. "

¹⁸ Ratnakūṭa Sūtra: Four dharmas that diminish wholesome dharmas: (one) conceited quest for worldly philosophy, (two) intent on gain/honor, (three) hatred-accusation of bodhisattvas, (four) rejection of unheard sūtras.

¹⁹ Sarvāstivāda Vinaya: The monk who prostrated at the stūpa would enjoy thousands of wheel-turning sovereignties. But these roots of virtue become thin and exhausted when a fellow-practitioner generates ill-mind toward a fellow-practitioner. "Don't corrupt your mind even toward a burnt post. "

²⁰ Mañjuśrīvikrīḍita Sūtra: "'Opposition' (pratigha) destroys roots of virtue accumulated over a hundred kalpas. "

²¹ Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra: Samantasattvaparitāṇyojaḥśrī recounts that through mutual contempt's unwholesome root, beings fall away from life-span, beauty, strength, ease.

²² Ratnamegha Sūtra: The bodhisattva accepts even a Sumeru-sized heap of jewels or small contemptible things, thinking "These stingy, greedy beings drown in saṃsāra because of this. This will be for their long-term welfare. " Having accepted, he doesn't make it his own, doesn't generate greed, but offers it to Buddha-Dharma-Saṅgha in common with all beings and uses it as livelihood for suffering beings. And by that gift he is not exalted.

²³ Ratnamegha: The eleven forms of "pride struck down"—dwelling like a corpse, wearing discolored garments, shaved head with bowl, like an outcaste youth, bowl-liver, accepting what's cast off, pleasing teachers, satisfying fellow-practitioners, attaining unobtained Buddha-dharmas, dwelling in patience among angry beings.

²⁴ Sāgaramati Sūtra: The bodhisattva is purified in body with perfect limbs yet not intoxicated by form. Even to lowly, deformed beings he bows and prostrates. Just as the ocean settles in a low place and all rivers flow into it with little difficulty, so for the non-prideful bodhisattva the profound Dharma-joys come to the ear with little difficulty. The prideful bodhisattva is "pierced by Māra's hook. "

²⁵ Lokottaraparivarta Sūtra: The ten Māra-works: (one) lack of reverence, (two) not bowing to Dharma-preachers, (three) generating conceit, (four) generating pride, (five) making Dharma-hatred due to person-hatred, (six) seeking high position, (seven) being frown-faced, (eight) not approaching the wise, (nine) overpowered by pride, exhausting merit, (ten) result: not meeting Buddha for a hundred thousand kalpas. The antidote: non-pride toward all beings.

²⁶ Rāṣṭrapāla Sūtra: Those grasped by pride go to bad destinies, poverty, low birth, birth-blindness, weakness, short life.

²⁷ Dharmasaṃgīti Sūtra: "The being-field is the bodhisattva's buddha-field, because from the buddha-field comes acquisition of Buddha-dharmas. "

²⁸ Ratnolkā Dhāraṇī: The bodhisattva generates ten kinds of mind toward all beings from the very beginning: welfare-mind, happiness-mind, nurse-mind, affectionate-mind, dear-mind, assistance-mind, protection-mind, equal-mind, ācārya-mind, śāstṛ-mind.

²⁹ Śraddhābalādhānāvatāramudrā Sūtra: "I'm established in being a student of all beings. I'm established in bowing and prostrating to all beings. "

³⁰ Vimalakīrtinirdeśa: For pure buddha-field arising, teacher-love toward all beings is taught. Even when sweeping seats or washing feet, the bodhisattva should cultivate love-regard and reverence-practice toward women, those in untimely states, the fallen.

³¹ Gaṇḍavyūha Sūtra: The story of King Sarvadharmanirnādacchatramaṇḍalanirghoṣa who was more delighted to see beggars than to have his kingdom. Toward all beggars he generated only-son perception, mother-father perception, venerable perception, good friend perception, rare perception, difficult-doer perception, supreme benefactor perception, bodhi-path support perception, ācārya-śāstṛ perception.

³² Bhikṣuprakīrṇaka: The Blessed One attended a sick monk, saying "I'll attend you, monk. I'll wash your robes. " Ānanda said "I'll wash them, Blessed One. " The Buddha replied "Then you wash, Ānanda. The Tathāgata will pour the water. " The Buddha poured water while Ānanda washed the robes and bathed the sick monk.

³³ Service Verses: The extended verse section (lines one hundred seventy-eight to two hundred eighty-five of Sanskrit) on serving beings as serving Buddhas. Beings are wish-fulfilling jewels. The bodhisattva's masters. "Let crowds place their feet on my head, or let them strike—may the World-Protector be pleased. " This is pleasing the Tathāgatas, accomplishing one's own aim, removing the world's suffering.

³⁴ Candrapradīpa Sūtra: Whatever immeasurable worships in hundreds of fields, in billions—having worshiped incomparable Leaders—doesn't equal a fraction of the loving mind.

³⁵ Ratnamegha: How the bodhisattva is free from unwise attention: doesn't think "I dwell unmixed in solitude, practiced in the Dharma, while other śramaṇas and brāhmaṇas dwell mixed, fallen from the Dharma. " Doesn't taste great vigor, doesn't exalt himself, doesn't despise others.

³⁶ Akṣayamati Sūtra: Merit dedicated to awakening has no intermediate exhaustion until sitting on the enlightenment-seat. Like a drop fallen into the great ocean—no exhaustion until kalpa's end.
