- **Protective**: Guarding body, speech, and mind

## Translation Approach

## Special Considerations

- **Anthology as Testimony**: Multiple sūtra voices = congregation witnessing
- **Self-Offering**: Ch. 1's radical body-offering is pure Blues sacrifice
- **Protection Songs**: Guarding body/speech/mind = spiritual armor
- **Practical Ethics**: This is about *living* the truth, not just knowing it

## Voice and Tone

- **Respectful**: Honor the wisdom wherever it's found
- **Authentic**: The idiom must ring true
- **Deep**: Accessible doesn't mean shallow
- **Congregational**: Multiple voices testifying
- **Honest**: The Blues tells the truth, even when it costs
