## The 24/7 Practice

We talked about remembering the Three Jewels.¹ Now we gotta talk about **increasing** what you got.

How? By making **every move count**.

The *Ratnamegha Sūtra* tells you how to turn ordinary life into practice:

> *When you offer flowers at the shrine, you say:*
> *"May all beings smell the sweet scent of freedom,*
> *Not the stink of their own dirt."*

> *When you clean the temple, you say:*
> *"May I sweep the junk out of everyone's head."*

> *When you open a door, you say:*
> *"I'm opening the door to the Great Freedom."*

> *When you close a door, you say:*
> *"I'm locking out the devil and his bad news."*

> *When you sit down, you say:*
> *"May everyone find their seat at the Great Table."*

> *When you lie down to sleep, you say:*
> *"May I lead everyone to the Great Rest (Nirvāṇa)."*

> *When you wake up, you say:*
> *"Wake up, world! The nightmare is over."*

> *When you wash your hands, you say:*
> *"I'm washing off the sticky residue of the past."*

Every move. Every breath. Every step.
**Nothing is wasted.**

## When the Road Gets Rough

The *Prajñāpāramitā* tells you what to do when you step into the bad neighborhoods.

### 1. The Jungle (*Vyālakāntāra*)
If the tigers are hungry, you say:
"Eat up, brothers. This body was a loaner anyway.
Now I fulfill the Perfection of Giving.
And when I become a Buddha, there won't be no animals in my world
hurting each other for food."

### 2. The Thieves' Road (*Corakāntāra*)
If the robbers strip you clean, you say:
"Take it. It's heavy carrying all this stuff anyway.
No anger here. Just donations.
I already let go of everything—body, goods, the whole pile.
May my patience be perfected.
And when I become a Buddha, there won't be no thieves in my world."

### 3. The Desert (*Pānīyakāntāra*)
If you're dying of thirst, you say:
"I'm gonna cut the thirst of all beings.
I don't fear. I stay steady.
And if I die here, I feel compassion:
These beings got so little merit, they gotta walk through deserts.
When I become a Buddha, water will flow everywhere.
Eight-fold excellent water. Nobody will thirst."

### 4. The Famine (*Bubhukṣākāntāra*)
If there's no food, you armor up:
"I'm gonna make a world where the fridge is always full.
Where you can eat just by thinking about it.
Like the gods in the Thirty-Three Heavens—
Whatever you want, it appears.
That's the world I'm building."

## Better Than Money

What's the best thing you can give?
**The Teaching (*Dharmadāna*).**

The *Adhyāśayasaṃcodana Sūtra* lists twenty benefits of giving the Dharma **without asking for anything back** (*Nirāmiṣa*):

You get memory. You get intelligence. You get wisdom.
Your mind gets light. Your enemies can't touch you.
Māra can't find a way in. The Buddhas take notice.
The gods protect you. Your friends don't betray you.
People listen when you speak. You got confidence.
**You never forget that teaching you gave.**

The *Prajñāpāramitā* says it plain:

> *Ānanda, imagine you teach the Śrāvaka path*
> *To all beings in a billion worlds,*
> *And they all become Arhats.*
>
> *That's good.*
>
> *But if you teach a Bodhisattva*
> *Just **one verse** about the Perfection of Wisdom,*
> *You done me a bigger service.*
>
> *Why?*
> *Because the Bodhisattva path leads to the freedom of **everyone**.*
> *Not just one person. **Everyone**.*

### How to Give the Teaching

The *Saddharmapuṇḍarīka* tells you the protocol:

> *Sit in a clean place.*
> *Wear a clean robe.*
> *Don't look tired. Don't look mad.*
> *Look at the crowd like they are your own children.*
>
> *And lay it down.*
>
> *Don't ask for food. Don't ask for thanks.*
> *Don't ask for anything.*
> *Just think:*
> *"I want them to be Buddhas. I want them to be free."*

## The Foundation of Everything

How do you protect what you got? How do you purify it? How do you increase it?

**The Four Right Efforts (*Samyakprahāṇa*).**

1. **Stop the bad from arising.**
   You see the dirt coming? You shut the door.

2. **Drop the bad that's already there.**
   You got dirt in you? You wash it out.

3. **Start the good that ain't there yet.**
   You see an opportunity to do right? You take it.

4. **Increase the good that's already there.**
   You got something good going? You double down.

And all of this is held together by **Non-Carelessness (*Apramāda*).**

The *Candrapradīpa Sūtra* says it straight:

> *All the good dharmas—*
> *Morality, learning, giving, patience—*
> *They all got one root:*
> *Non-carelessness.*
> *The treasure-find the Sugata taught.*

What's non-carelessness?
It's guarding your senses. Not grabbing at signs.
Seeing pleasure, pain, and freedom in everything—seeing it as it really is.

## Self and Other Ain't Different

Why do all this? Why sweat for people you don't know?

**Because the "Self" you're protecting? It's a lie.**

Listen:

> *You protect your foot with your hand.*
> *Why?*
> *The hand don't feel the foot's pain.*
> *But they're on the same team—the same body.*

> *The whole world is one Body (*Ātmabhāva*).*

> *"I'll suffer later"—that's a lie.*
> *The "You" that sins today is dead by Tuesday.*
> *The "You" that burns in hell is a stranger.*

> *So why care?*
> *Because **suffering is suffering**.*
> *It don't have a nametag.*
> *If it hurts, stop it.*
> *Don't ask "Whose hurt is this?"*
> *Just put out the fire.*

This is **Self-Other Equality (*Parātmasamatā*).**

You practice it. You meditate on it.
You make your Bodhicitta **firm**.

And when you do?
**You can't be turned back.**

---


## Bodhicitta is the Root

The *Ratnakaraṇḍaka Sūtra* tells you the secret:

> *Just like fragrant trees grow when watered,*
> *So does your merit grow when held by Bodhicitta.*
> *And when you dedicate it to All-Knowledge,*
> *It keeps growing forever.*

**Bodhicitta is the root of all increase.**

Everything you do—giving, patience, morality, wisdom—
If it's got Bodhicitta in it, it grows.
If it don't, it dries up.

That's the Long Game.
You plant the seed. You water it with love.
You wait. You endure.
And one day, the whole world blooms.

## The Final Bow

We end where we started.
With the Prince of Wisdom, **Mañjuśrī**.

> *I tip my hat to the Prince.*
> *He's the Cool Lake when the world is on fire.*
> *He's the General who crushes the Devil's army.*
> *He's the condensed goodness of the whole universe.*

> *To Mañjughoṣa, the realest player in the game:*
> *I bow down.*

> *He walks through hell like a swan through a lotus pond.*
> *He relieves the suffering of the scorched.*
> *He fills the abyss of craving in the three worlds.*
> *He's the Great Cloud raining down what the world needs.*

> *He's the Tree of the Ten Directions,*
> *Bearing the fruit beings long for.*
> *He's honored by bodhisattvas whose hair stands on end*
> *Just thinking about His greatness.*

> *To the Doctor of All Suffering,*
> *To the Giver of the Feast of Happiness,*
> *To the One who feeds all beings—*
> *To Mañjughoṣa, I bow again and again.*

## The End of the Training

**This wraps up the Compendium of Training.**

We guarded the body. We protected the goods. We purified the mind.
We learned the moves. We sang the prayers. We walked the road.

Now **the music starts**.

**Get on the floor and dance.**

*Thus ends the Nineteenth and Final Chapter: The Long Game.*

**The Śikṣāsamuccaya is complete.**

## Bluesman's Notes

1. **Daily Life Sanctification**: The opening section is powerful. Every ordinary action—opening a door, washing hands, lying down—becomes a prayer. This is the "24/7 Hustle." You don't clock out.

2. **The Four Wildernesses**: The *Prajñāpāramitā* gives four scenarios: tigers, thieves, thirst, famine. In each one, the Bodhisattva doesn't panic. He transforms the danger into a vow: "When I'm a Buddha, this won't exist." That's the Long Game.

3. **Dharmadāna**: Giving the Dharma is better than any material gift because it lasts forever. The key is *nirāmiṣa*—"without bait." You don't teach to get paid, to get famous, or to feel good. You teach because beings need to be free.

4. **The Four Right Efforts**: This is the engine of the whole path. Stop bad. Drop bad. Start good. Increase good. And hold it all together with *apramāda*—non-carelessness. Stay awake.

5. **Self-Other Equality**: This is the heart of Mahāyāna. You practice seeing "other" as "self" until the distinction disappears. The hand protects the foot not because the hand will get a reward, but because they're the same body. That's how you gotta see the world.

6. **Bodhicitta as Root**: Everything grows from Bodhicitta. Without it, you got nothing. With it, you got everything. That's why we end the whole book with Bodhicitta.

7. **Mañjuśrī Homage**: The final verses are a love song to Mañjuśrī, the embodiment of wisdom. He's the one who cuts ignorance. He's the one who shows you the empty house. He gets the last word.
