# Chapter 1: The Road of Generosity
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Blues Interpretation by Master John Kim
### Part 2: Faith as Foundation and the Waking-Up Mind

*Having reviewed the Professor's scholarly translation of the Ratnolkā and Gaṇḍavyūha passages on faith and bodhicitta, Master John Kim now renders them in Blues vernacular.*

## The Choice That Changes Everything

When you've really *seen* the suffering of this world—
seen it from the inside and the outside both—
and you start wanting something better,
something that brings *peace*...

That's when something stirs in you.¹
That's when you start asking the real question:

> *If I don't want fear and pain for myself,*
> *and others don't want it either—*
> *then what makes me so special*
> *that I only look out for number one?*²

You see what I'm saying? We're all in this together.

## The Root of Everything: Faith

So what's the first step? *Faith.*³

Not blind belief—real trust. Trust grounded in the road you've already walked. The old Ratnolkā teaching puts it this way:

> *By faith you follow the Victorious Ones.*
> *By faith you trust their teaching.*
> *By faith in how the bodhisattvas live—*
> *that's how the waking-up mind is born in great souls.*

### What Faith Does

Faith goes before you like a mother,⁴ like a guide.
It protects everything good in you. Makes it grow.

Faith dispels all your doubts,
carries you across the flood,⁵
shows you the way,
teaches you how to be patient.

Faith is *clear-minded*—no muddiness, no pride.
It's the root of real respect.

Faith is a treasure-chest of wealth,
the chief of good conduct—
like a hand that gathers up all your virtue.

### The Chain of Faith

*Now listen—this is how it builds:*⁶

Those who have faith and respect for the Buddha?
They don't throw away their discipline or training.

Those who keep their discipline?
They're praised among the virtuous.

Those with faith in the Dharma?
They *can't get enough* of the teaching—they keep listening.

Those who keep listening?
They start believing in the inconceivable.

Those with faith in the Sangha?
They become unshakeable, devoted to the community.

Those who are unshakeable?
Their faculties get sharp and bright.

Those with sharp faculties?
They drop the bad company.

Those who drop bad company?
They embrace *dharmic friends*⁷—spiritual kinfolk.

Those with good friends?
They pile up vast merit.

Those with vast merit?
They become great souls, full of the power of causes.

Great souls with that power?
They have noble conviction, distinguished and deep.

Those with noble conviction?
All the Buddhas bless them constantly.

Those blessed by the Buddhas?
In *them* the waking-up mind arises.

Those with the waking-up mind?
They're devoted to the qualities of the great sages.

Those devoted to the sages?
They're *born into the Buddha-family*, well-born.

Those born into the Buddha-family?
They're freed from false connection.

Those who are freed?
Their hearts are purified with clarity.

Those with purified hearts?
Their higher disposition is supreme.

Those with supreme disposition?
They *always* practice the perfections.

Those who practice the perfections?
They've entered the Great Vehicle.

Those in the Great Vehicle?
They worship the Buddhas through practice.

Those who worship through practice?
Recollection of Buddha is pure in them.

Those with pure recollection?
They always see and contemplate the Buddhas.

Those who see the Buddhas?
The Buddha *never* stands apart from them.

Those from whom Buddha never stands apart?
The Dharma never departs from them.

Those from whom Dharma never departs?
They are *ever blessed* by all the Victorious Ones.

### The Rarity of Faith

And the old scripture concludes:

> *Rare among ordinary folks are those who have faith in teachings like these.*
> *But those who've accumulated goodness, who've made merit—*
> *they have faith through the power of causes.*
>
> *Say you served beings as numerous as the dust of ten buddha-fields*
> *for a whole eon, with every happiness—*
> *even that merit ain't as great*
> *as the merit of one who simply has faith in this teaching.*⁸

You hear that? *Faith itself* is the great offering.

## The Waking-Up Mind: Bodhicitta

So you got faith. Now what?

Now you strengthen that *waking-up mind*—that bodhicitta.⁹
Because that's what holds all your merit together.

Prince Lion asked the Buddha:¹⁰
> *"By what action does one gather all good things?*
> *How do you become dear to beings wherever you're born?"*

The Blessed One said:
> *"Bend your mind toward awakening*
> *for the liberation of all beings.*
> *That's how you gather all things good.*
> *That's how you become beloved."*

### What Bodhicitta Is

The Gaṇḍavyūha—that great Flower Ornament teaching—puts it this way:¹¹

> *Bodhicitta is the **seed** of all Buddha-qualities.*
> *It's the **field** where all white dharmas grow.*
> *It's the **ground** where all the world takes refuge.*
> *It's like a **father** protecting all bodhisattvas.*
>
> *It's like Vaiśravaṇa,¹² cutting off all poverty.*
> *It's like the wish-fulfilling gem, accomplishing all purposes.*
> *It's like the auspicious pot, fulfilling all intentions.*
>
> *It's like a **spear** conquering the enemy of afflictions.*
> *It's like a **sword** severing the head of the defilements.*
> *It's like an **axe** cutting down the tree of suffering.*
> *It's like a **weapon** protecting from all dangers.*
> *It's like a **hook** drawing beings out of the waters of saṃsāra.*
>
> *It's like a **whirlwind** scattering all hindrances like grass.*
> *It's like a **summary** gathering all the bodhisattva vows.*
> *It's like a **shrine** for gods, humans, and all the rest.*

So bodhicitta ain't just a nice feeling.
It's a *seed*, a *sword*, a *hook*, a *shrine*—
everything you need to walk this road.

## Endnotes

¹ **"something stirs in you"**: The arising of bodhicitta through the Buddha-gotra (Buddha-nature)—the innate capacity for awakening present in all beings.

² **"what makes me so special"**: This is Bodhicaryāvatāra 8.120—the logic of equal concern for self and other. If we both don't want suffering, why protect only myself?

³ **"Faith"**: Sanskrit *śraddhā*. Not belief without evidence, but trust grounded in what you've come to know through practice.

⁴ **"like a mother"**: The Ratnolkā compares faith to a mother (*mātṛ*)—nurturing, protective, guiding.

⁵ **"the flood"**: Sanskrit *ogha*—the flood of saṃsāra, traditionally the four floods of desire, existence, views, and ignorance.

⁶ **"this is how it builds"**: The Ratnolkā presents faith as a chain reaction—each quality leads to the next, building toward full awakening. This is classic Blues epistemology: one step at a time, each step earned.

⁷ **"dharmic friends"**: *Kalyāṇamitra* / *dhārmikamitra*—spiritual friends who support your practice. In Blues tradition: your people, your congregation, the ones who keep you honest.

⁸ **"faith itself is the great offering"**: The merit of having faith in the teaching exceeds even vast material offerings. Faith is the *root* from which all else grows.

⁹ **"bodhicitta"**: The awakening mind; the aspiration for Buddhahood for the sake of all beings. Blues equivalent: "that waking-up heart."

¹⁰ **"Prince Lion"**: The Siṃhaparipṛcchā—"Questions of Lion"—a sūtra where a prince asks the Buddha about generating bodhicitta.

¹¹ **"Flower Ornament teaching"**: The Gaṇḍavyūha, part of the Avataṃsaka Sūtra. One of the most elaborate Mahāyāna scriptures.

¹² **"Vaiśravaṇa"**: The god of wealth (Kubera); one of the four great kings who protect the world.

## Theological Notes

- **Faith as African-American Testimony**: The Ratnolkā's "chain of faith" mirrors Black church tradition—each testimony building on the last, creating a web of witness.

- **Bodhicitta as Practical Power**: The metaphors for bodhicitta (seed, sword, axe, hook) make clear this isn't passive sentiment. It's *active*, *militant*, *transformative*—the heart of a warrior who loves.

- **The Logic of Compassion**: The opening verse shows the logical foundation: if we equally dislike suffering, there's no rational ground for prioritizing self over other. This is Blues ethics: we're all in this together.
