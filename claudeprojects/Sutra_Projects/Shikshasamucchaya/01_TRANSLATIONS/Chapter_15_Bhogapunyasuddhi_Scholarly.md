# Chapter 15: Purification of Goods and Merit (Bhogapuṇyaśuddhi)
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

---

**Summary**: Following the purification of the person (*ātmabhāva*), Śāntideva turns to the purification of the bodhisattva's resources (*bhoga*) and merit (*puṇya*). The core principle for goods is **Right Livelihood** (*samyagājīva*)—avoiding hypocrisy (*kuhanā*) and wrong means. The core principle for merit is **Sky-Like Purity** (*gaganasama-viśuddhi*)—practicing the six perfections without the three concepts (giver, gift, receiver), thereby making merit boundless and unpolluted.

### 1. Purification of Goods Through Right Livelihood

Immediately after the purification of the self, the purification of goods (*bhogaśuddhi*) is written here separately due to the absence of accumulation (*saṃcayābhāva*).¹

One should know the purification of goods through the purification of **Right Livelihood** (*samyagājīva*).

As stated in the *Ārya-Ugraparipṛcchā*:

> "Here, householder, the lay bodhisattva seeks enjoyments by the Dharma, not by adharma. By fair means (*samena*), not by unfair means (*viṣameṇa*). It becomes Right Livelihood, not wrong livelihood."

### 2. Avoiding Hypocrisy (Kuhanā)

The *Ārya-Ratnamegha Sūtra* details the avoidance of hypocrisy in seeking alms:²

> "A bodhisattva, seeing a donor or patron (*dānapati*), does not construct a posture (*īryāpatha*).
>
> **How does he not construct a posture?**
> He does not lift and place his feet slowly, slowly, sluggishly. Not looking only a yoke's length ahead (*yugamātraprekṣikayā*). But looking confidently, looking naturally (*anābhogaprekṣikayā*). Thus he does not perform **bodily hypocrisy** (*kāyakuhanā*).
>
> **How does he not perform vocal hypocrisy?**
> For the sake of gain, for the cause of gain, he does not become soft-spoken, gentle-spoken, sweet-spoken. He does not utter flattering words.
>
> **How does he not form mental hypocrisy?**
> Even when offered gain by a donor, he displays fewness of desires (*alpecchatā*). He does not generate longing in the mind.
>
> *'This is internal burning, son of good family: when there is fewness of desire in speech, but desire for gain in the mind.'*
>
> Thus the bodhisattva is free from hypocrisy and lapana (hinting/chatter)."

### 3. Avoiding Hinting and Hinting-Actions

> "He does not make a sign (*nimitta*) upon seeing a donor: 'I am distressed by lack of robes, I am distressed by lack of a bowl.'
>
> He does not ask or pray for anything. He does not utter words like: 'Such and such donor gave me such and such object... because he thought I was virtuous, learned, of few desires.'
>
> Thus he is free from **hinting-gain** (*nimittalābha*)."

### 4. Purification of Merit (Puṇyaśodhanam)³

> "From the activity born of the womb of Emptiness and Compassion, there is purification of merit." (Kārikā 21)

As stated in the *Ārya-Gaganagañja Sūtra*: The purity of merit is like the sky (*gagana*).

> "He gives that gift purified of 'I-making' (*ahaṃkāra*).
> Purified of 'Mine-making' (*mamakāra*).
> Purified of view, sign, and diversity.
> Purified of expecting a result (*vipākapratikāṅkṣaṇā*).
>
> **He gives a gift equal to the sky (*gaganasama*).**
>
> Just as the sky is boundless (*aparyanta*), so he gives with a boundless mind.
> Just as the sky is vast and unobstructed, so he gives a gift dedicated to awakening (*bodhipariṇāmita*).
> Just as the sky is formless (*arūpin*), so he gives not relying on any form.
>
> Just as a magically created man (*nirmita*) gives to a magically created man—without discrimination, without effort (*anābhoga*), free from mind-thought-consciousness—so the bodhisattva gives that gift purified by the self-nature of illusion (*māyālakṣaṇa*).
>
> Such a bodhisattva becomes a **Sky-Like Donor** (*gaganasamadāna*)."

### 5. The Sky-Like Perfections

The *Gaganagañja Sūtra* applies this sky-metaphor to all perfections:

*   **Sky-Like Morality (*Śīla*)**: Pure, stainless, calm, not elevated (*anunnata*), not dependent. "Whatever morality is sky-like, that is the bodhisattva's supreme morality."
*   **Sky-Like Patience (*Kṣānti*)**: Unobstructed like the sky. Equal toward all beings.
    *   *Metaphor*: "Just as if there were a great Sāla forest. Someone comes and cuts down a Sāla tree. The remaining trees do not think: 'He is cut, we are uncut.' They have no attachment or aversion. Just so is the sky-like patience."
*   **Sky-Like Vigor (*Vīrya*)**: Knowledge of the body as a reflection (*pratibhāsa*), speech as inexpressible, mind as untroubled.
*   **Sky-Like Meditation (*Dhyāna*)**: The meditation endowed with the best of all forms (*sarvākāravaropeta*) but accomplished through the aspect of emptiness.
    *   Calm by nature, but not calm (inactive) in karma and defilements.
    *   Indifferent to all dharmas, but attentive to Buddha-dharmas.
    *   Cool through peace, but blazing in ripening beings.

### 6. The Realm of the Bodhisattva

As stated in the *Vimalakīrtinirdeśa*:

> "The realm of turning the Wheel of the True Dharma, and the realm of demonstrating Great Parinirvāṇa, and the realm of not abandoning the bodhisattva practice—this too is the bodhisattva's realm (*gocara*)."

## Scholarly Notes

1.  **Saṃcayābhāva**: "Absence of accumulation." Unlike ordinary wealth which is hoarded (*saṃcita*), the bodhisattva's goods are pure because they are constantly flowing out to beings. They are "accumulated" only in the sense of merit, not possession.
2.  **Five Wrong Livelihoods**: The text alludes to the classic list: *kuhanā* (hypocrisy/posturing), *lapanā* (hinting/chatter), *naimittika* (fortune-telling/sign-reading), *niṣpeṣikā* (bullying/extortion), and *lābhena lābhaniścikīrṣā* (seeking gain with gain/interest).
3.  **Puṇyaśodhanam**: Purification of merit prevents it from becoming a cause for saṃsāric happiness (which is exhausted) and transforms it into a cause for awakening (which is inexhaustible). The mechanism is *pariṇāmanā* (dedication) sealed with *śūnyatā* (emptiness).
