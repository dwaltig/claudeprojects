## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Blues Vernacular Translation by William Altig

---

*The second chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on holding fast to the true teaching and never letting go of your spiritual people.*

## You Gave It Away—Now Keep It Safe

So you gave yourself away.¹ You gave your stuff away. You gave your merit away.

Good.

But now you gotta *protect* what you gave. Why? Because:

### The Teaching (Kārikā 5)

> **You gave your body and your goods for beings to use.**
> **But if you don't protect the gift, how they gonna enjoy it?**
> **What kind of gift is it if nobody gets fed?**

That's the thing—a gift that don't reach nobody ain't really a gift at all.

So protect yourself, your goods, your merit—*for their sake*, not yours.

---

## Don't Kill Yourself Tryina Save Yourself

The old teaching says:²

> "When you're trying to protect others, that's when you protect yourself. With that kind of heart, a bodhisattva won't do evil—not even to save their own life."

And another scripture says:³

> "Carry this body like a wagon—just for the Dharma, nothing else."

And:

> "Don't get worn out by suffering. Keep your eye on the beings."

---


## How Do You Protect All This?

Simple: **Don't abandon your spiritual friends.**⁴

That's it. That's the secret.

The old Flower Ornament teaching puts it this way:⁵

> "Bodhisattvas held up by good friends don't fall into bad places.
> Bodhisattvas attended by good friends don't break the training.
> Bodhisattvas sheltered by good friends rise above the world.
> Bodhisattvas served by good friends don't forget the way.
> Bodhisattvas embraced by good friends become untouchable by karma and afflictions.
>
> Good friends teach you. They hold you back from foolishness. They lead you out of the burning house of this world."

---

## How to Approach Your Teachers

So how do you go to your spiritual friends? Like this:⁶

With a mind like **the earth**—carrying every burden.
With a mind like **a diamond**—unbreakable in intention.
With a mind like **a mountain range**—not shaking in suffering.
With a mind like **a servant**—not too proud for any task.
With a mind like **a dust-rag**—no arrogance, no pride.
With a mind like **a vehicle**—carrying heavy loads.
With a mind like **a dog**—not getting angry.
With a mind like **a boat**—not afraid of coming and going.
Like **a good child**—just looking at your teacher's face.

---

## The Four Perceptions

And in yourself, generate these perceptions:⁷

**You are sick.** Your teachers are **doctors.**
Their instructions are **medicine.** Practice is **the cure.**

Or:

**You are afraid.** Your teachers are **warriors.**
Their instructions are **weapons.** Practice is **destroying the enemy.**

---

## What Happens When You Trust Your Teachers

When you practice what they teach:⁸

> The Buddhas become pleased with you.
> Omniscience draws near to you.
> More good friends come to you.
> All your purposes come face to face.

You can't lose when you're with your people.

## Sudhana's Devotion

Now listen to how Sudhana—that young pilgrim—related to his teachers:⁹

He bowed at their feet. He circled them a hundred thousand times. He looked at them and bowed, looked again and bowed again. He kept his mind on them, reflected on them, contemplated them, gave utterances of joy, made sounds of wonder. He remembered their qualities, stabilized his memory, never abandoned them in thought.

When he left—even from a distance—he kept turning back, kept looking, kept bowing.

And when he saw that all his wisdom came from his teachers, he walked away *weeping*, with tears running down his face.¹⁰

That's how you love your teachers.

---


## Sadāprarudita Sells Himself

Now here's the most powerful story in all the scriptures:¹¹

There was a bodhisattva named Sadāprarudita—which means "Ever-Weeping."¹² He wept constantly from the ache of loving the Dharma.

One day he came to a city with this thought:

> "I'm gonna sell this body of mine. And with the money, I'll make offerings to my teacher Dharmodgata.¹³ All these lives I've thrown my body away for desire, for craving, for nothing. But never once for the Dharma. Never once for beings. That ends today."

So he stood in the marketplace and cried out:

**"Who wants a man? Who wants a man? Who wants a man?"**

---

## Māra Intervenes

Now Māra—the Evil One—he got scared.¹⁴ He arranged things so nobody could hear Sadāprarudita's cry.

When no buyer came, Sadāprarudita went off alone and *wept*.

He said: "What misfortune! I can't even find someone to buy this worthless body!"

---

## Śakra's Test

Then Śakra—lord of the gods—came down disguised as a young brahmin.¹⁵ He said:

> "Why are you crying, friend? Why the tears?"

Sadāprarudita said:

> "I want to sell this body to make Dharma-offerings. But nobody will buy it."

Śakra said:

> "I don't need a man. But my father has a sacrifice to perform. I need a man's **heart**, his **blood**, and his **bone-marrow**. Will you sell me those?"

---

## The Sale

Sadāprarudita thought:

> "What luck! I've found a buyer! For my heart, my blood, my marrow—for the Dharma!"

With **joyful mind**, **glad mind**, **delighted mind**, he said:

> "I'll give you whatever you need from this body."

Then he took a sharp blade. He pierced his right arm and let the blood flow. He pierced his right thigh, stripped it of flesh, and went to a wall to crack open the bone for marrow.¹⁶

---

## The Merchant's Daughter

A rich man's daughter was watching from her balcony. She came down and asked:

> "What are you *doing* to yourself?"

He told her. She asked:

> "What benefit will you gain from this?"

He said:

> "My teacher will give me the Prajñāpāramitā—the Perfection of Wisdom. I'll train in it. And training, I'll become a refuge for all beings."

She said:

> "Wonderful! For even *one* such teaching, bodies equal to the sands of the Ganges should be given up! But friend—I'll give you gold, gems, pearls, lapis—everything you need to make offerings. You don't have to sell your flesh."¹⁷

And with five hundred maidens, she joined him on the road to his teacher.

---

## Seven Years of Waiting

When they arrived, the teacher Dharmodgata went into deep meditation.¹⁸ He stayed absorbed for **seven years**.

For seven years, Sadāprarudita:
- Never had a thought of desire.
- Never had a thought of ill-will.
- Never had a thought of harm.
- Never craved any taste.

His only thought, day and night:

> "When will my teacher arise? We'll prepare his seat. We'll sweep the ground. We'll scatter flowers."

And those five hundred maidens? They learned from him. For seven years, they only walked and stood—**never sat, never lay down**.¹⁹

---

## The Divine Voice

Then Sadāprarudita heard a voice from heaven:²⁰

> "In seven days, Dharmodgata will arise. He will sit in the city and teach."

Overjoyed, Sadāprarudita cleaned the ground. He and the maidens built a Dharma-seat from seven jewels.

But when he tried to sprinkle water on the ground—there was none. Māra had made it disappear.²¹

---

## The Blood-Offering

Sadāprarudita thought:

> "What if I pierce my own body and sprinkle the ground with my blood? This dirt is dusty. I don't want dust falling on my teacher. What am I saving this body for anyway? It's gonna break down eventually. Better it break for the Dharma than for nothing."

So he took a sharp blade. He pierced himself all over. He sprinkled that whole patch of ground with his own blood.

And those five hundred maidens did the same.²²

Yet through all of this—**not one of them had a change of mind**. Māra found no opening.

---


## Never Abandon Your People

The old teaching says:²³

> "A spiritual friend should never be abandoned by a bodhisattva—for as long as you live. Not even to save your life."

### The Teaching (Kārikā 6)

> **Don't abandon your spiritual friends.**
> **Keep your eye on the scriptures.**
> **That's how you protect yourself, your goods, your merit—everything.**

---

## What Is Dharma-Holding?

The Sāgaramati teaching breaks it down:²⁴

**Holding the Dharma means:**
- Serving your teachers: cherishing, attending, rising for, waiting on
- Giving them robes, food, medicine
- Praising them, protecting their reputation
- Concealing their faults when outsiders criticize

**Holding the Dharma means:**
- Not disputing with fools
- Defeating wrong teaching through right teaching

**Holding the Dharma means:**
- Giving Dharma to others without expecting anything back

**Holding the Dharma means:**
- Even taking **one step** to hear the teaching
- Even **one breath** in service of the Dharma

**Holding the Dharma means:**
- Taming this wild mind
- Calming, restraining, training

**Holding the Dharma means:**
- Never grasping a teaching that produces evil

---

## Why This Matters

Without this—without holding the Dharma, without your teachers, without the scriptures—there's no protection. No purification. No increase.

**And without these, you ain't a bodhisattva at all.**

---

## The One Great Vow

Queen Śrīmālā taught:²⁵

> "All those countless bodhisattva vows, numerous as the sands of the Ganges—they're all contained in ONE great vow:
>
> **Holding on to what's real.**
>
> That one vow holds everything else."

---

## The Blow to Māra

And she also said:²⁶

> "Even a small blow to a vital spot will drop a strong man.
>
> Just so—even a *little* Dharma-holding is painful to Māra. It makes him grieve. It makes him wail.
>
> I don't see any other practice that hurts Māra like this one."

---

## Higher Than the Mountain

> "Just as Mount Sumeru, king of mountains, rises above all the hills—
>
> Just so, the Dharma-holding of one who's heedless of body and life rises above all other good deeds.
>
> Even the good deeds of those who still cling to their bodies."²⁷

---

## The Benefits in Song

From the Sāgaramati:²⁸

> *Embraced by the Victors you are,*
> *by gods, nāgas, and kinnaras.*
> *Embraced by merit and by knowing—*
> *when you hold the Tathāgatas' Dharma.*
>
> *You're never born in empty lands;*
> *in every life you see the Buddha.*
> *Seeing him, you find your faith—*
> *when you hold the Tathāgatas' Dharma.*
>
> *You remember your past lives;*
> *again and again you go forth.*
> *Pure in conduct, grounded in practice—*
> *when you hold the Tathāgatas' Dharma.*
>
> *Skilled you become, and you gain dhāraṇī;*
> *your good don't fade in a hundred eons.*
> *Eloquent, unattached you become—*
> *when you hold the Tathāgatas' Dharma.*
>
> *Śakra, Brahmā, world-protectors,*
> *human kings, wheel-turners on earth—*
> *with ease and happiness you wake up—*
> *when you hold the Tathāgatas' Dharma.*
>
> *Thirty-two marks appear on your body;*
> *blameless and discerning you become.*
> *Those who look at you never get full—*²⁹
> *when you hold the Tathāgatas' Dharma.*
>
> *Your awakening-mind don't get confused;*
> *you don't get puffed up in the perfections.*
> *Skillful among hundreds, not led astray—*
> *when you hold the Tathāgatas' Dharma.*

## Theological Notes

### Spiritual Friends as Survival
In Blues tradition, we call these "your people"—the congregation, the elders, the ones who've walked the road. Without them, you're lost. Śāntideva makes the same point: without *kalyāṇamitra*, no protection, no growth, no bodhisattvahood.

### The Sadāprarudita Model
Ever-Weeping is the extreme version of what we all feel when we love the teaching. He's willing to sell his flesh, pierce his body, wait seven years standing up. That's not metaphor—that's testimony.

### Blood as Water
When Māra takes the water, Sadāprarudita uses his own blood. In African-American spirituality, the blood offering is central: "Are you washed in the blood?" Here the bodhisattva washes the *ground* with blood—for the teacher, for the teaching, for all beings.

### The Feminine Presence
Notice that it's a *woman*—the merchant's daughter—who saves Sadāprarudita from mutilating himself. And 500 women complete his pilgrimage with him. The Dharma is upheld by the feminine as much as the masculine.

### One Vow Contains All
This is Blues theology: don't overcomplicate it. Queen Śrīmālā says all the countless vows are just *one* vow—hold on to what's real. That's the whole thing.
