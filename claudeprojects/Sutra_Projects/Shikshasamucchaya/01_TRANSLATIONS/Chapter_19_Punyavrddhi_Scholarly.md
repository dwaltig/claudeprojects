# Chapter 19: The Increase of Merit (Puṇyavṛddhi)
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

---

**Summary**: This is the final chapter of the *Śikṣāsamuccaya*. Having established the protections and purifications, Śāntideva concludes with the **Increase of Merit** (*Puṇyavṛddhi*). The central theme is the Bodhisattva's transformation of everyday actions into merit through **dedication (*pariṇāmanā*)** and the cultivation of **emptiness/compassion**. It culminates in a spectacular praise of Mañjuśrī, the embodiment of wisdom and the patron of this text.

### 1. Dedication in Daily Life

Another cause for the increase of merit is the **welfare of beings in all states** (*sarvāvasthāsu sattvārthaḥ*).
As stated in the *Ārya-Ratnamegha Sūtra*:¹

> "When offering a flower or incense to a Tathāgata shrine, he dedicates it: 'May all beings be free from the stench of immorality (*dauḥśīlya*) and attain the fragrance of the Tathāgata's morality.'
>
> When sweeping or cleaning, he dedicates it: 'May I sweep away the ungraceful conduct of all beings.'
>
> When raising a parasol, he dedicates it: 'May I remove the burning heat of defilements (*kleśa-paridāha*) for all beings.'
>
> When entering a monastery: 'May I lead all beings into the city of Nirvāṇa.'
> When leaving: 'May I liberate all beings from the prison of Saṃsāra.'
>
> When opening a door: 'May I open the door to the Sugata ways with transcendental knowledge.'
> When closing a door: 'May I close the doors to all evil destinies (*apāya*).'
>
> When sitting down: 'May all beings sit on the seat of awakening (*bodhimaṇḍa*).'
> When lying on the right side: 'May I lead all beings to Parinirvāṇa.'
> When rising: 'May I raise all beings from the ambush of defilments.'
>
> When washing hands: 'May I wash away the residual traces (*vāsanā*) of defilements for all beings.'
> When washing feet: 'May I wash away the dust of defilements.'
> When cleaning teeth: 'May I remove the stains of defilements.'"

### 2. Fearlessness in the Wilderness

The Bodhisattva's merit increases through **fearlessness** (*atrāsa*).
As stated in the *Ārya-Prajñāpāramitā*:²

> "Sāriputra, a Bodhisattva in a wilderness full of wild beasts (*vyālakāntāra*) should not be afraid. Why? Because he has renounced everything for the sake of beings.
>
> He should think: 'If beasts eat me, may it be a gift to them. My perfection of giving (*dānapāramitā*) will be fulfilled.'
>
> If in a wilderness of thieves (*corakāntāra*): 'If they take my belongings, let it be a gift. If they take my life, let me generate no anger. Thus my perfections of giving, morality, and patience will be fulfilled.'
>
> If in a wilderness of waterless wastes (*pānīyakāntāra*): 'I must train to cut off the thirst of all beings.'
>
> If in a wilderness of famine (*bubhukṣākāntāra*): He should armor himself (*saṃnāha*): 'I will purify my Buddha-field so that such famines never exist there. I will ensure all beings are satisfied with food and drink thought of by mind alone, like the trāyastriṃśa gods.'"

### 3. The Gift of Dharma (Dharmadāna)

The **Gift of Dharma** (*dharmadāna*) without material desire (*nirāmiṣa*) is a supreme cause of merit.
As stated in the *Ārya-Adhyāśayasaṃcodana Sūtra*, there are twenty benefits, including:
*   Mindfulness (*smṛti*)
*   Intelligence (*mati*)
*   Protection by non-humans (*amanuṣya*)
*   Meeting the Buddhas

The *Ārya-Prajñāpāramitā* declares: teaching even a single verse of the Perfection of Wisdom to another Bodhisattva generates more merit than teaching the entire Śrāvaka-Dharma to the entire universe. Why? Because the Bodhisattva preserves the lineage of the Buddhas.³

**How to Give Dharma**:
As stated in the *Saddharmapuṇḍarīka (Lotus Sutra)*:
> "Entering the abode, wearing clean robes,
> Sitting on a comfortable seat,
> With a mind free from envy or fatigue,
> He should teach the Dharma day and night.
> He seeks nothing for himself—
> Only thinking: 'May I and these beings become Buddhas.'"

### 4. The Root of Merit: Bodhicitta

In summary, the **Bodhicitta** is the root of the increase of merit.
As stated in the *Ārya-Ratnakaraṇḍaka Sūtra*:

> "Just as aromatic trees grow from the four elements, Mañjuśrī, so the Bodhisattva's roots of good, gathered by Bodhicitta and dedicated to omniscience, grow continuously."

### 5. Final Arguments on Self and Other

Śāntideva concludes with verses (likely from the *Bodhicaryāvatāra* tradition) deconstructing the Self to justify altruism:⁴

> "If fear and suffering are disliked by me and others equally,
> What is so special about 'Me' that I protect myself and not the other?
>
> 'My future suffering does not harm me now'—this is a false assumption.
> The 'I' who acts is dead; the 'I' who suffers is another birth.
>
> The foot's pain is not the hand's pain, yet the hand protects the foot.
> Why? Because they are part of one organism.
> Thus should one view the world as an organism (*ātmabhāva*).
>
> 'Self' is a fiction. It is a heap of elements/aggregates.
> Suffering exists, but there is no 'Sufferer.'
> Therefore, suppress suffering simply because it is suffering.
> Do not ask 'Whose?'"

### 6. Homage to Mañjuśrī

The text concludes with a final dedication and praise of Mañjuśrī, the Prince of Wisdom:

> "I bow to Mañjuśrī, the condensed form of the world's welfare.
> He who walks in the ocean of Buddha-fields in all directions.
> He who destroys the armies of Māra.
> He who is the cool lake for those scorched by suffering.
> To Mañjughoṣa, the Teacher, I bow."

**This is the nineteenth chapter, The Increase of Merit.**

**Here ends the Śikṣāsamuccaya, the Compendium of Training.**

### Footnotes

1.  **Ritualization of Daily Life**: These verses from the *Ratnamegha* serve as the prototype for "Gāthās" used in Zen and Vinaya practice, transforming mundane acts (opening doors, washing) into Mahāyāna rituals.
2.  **Wilderness Training**: The *kāntāra* (wilderness) is the testing ground for the perfections. The Bodhisattva uses danger to radicalize his generosity.
3.  **Superiority of Mahāyāna Dharma**: The mathematical comparison (1 verse of Prajñā vs. whole Śrāvaka canon) emphasizes that the *cause* (Bodhisattva training) is more valuable than the *result* (Arhatship) because it leads to the total liberation of all beings.
4.  **Parātmasamatā**: These philosophical verses mirror *Bodhicaryāvatāra* Chapter 8, arguing that since "Self" is a delusion using temporal continuity (child -> adult), we can equally use spatial continuity (self -> other) to justify compassion.
