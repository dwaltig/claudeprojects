# Chapter 17: The Benefits of Worship (Vandanānuśaṃsā)
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

---

**Summary**: This chapter details the immense karmic fruits (*anuśaṃsā*) of the worship practices described in the previous chapter. Drawing primarily from the *Avalokana Sūtra* and *Ratnarāśi Sūtra*, it catalogs the physical and spiritual benefits of circumambulating stūpas, offering flowers, lamps, and flags. It concludes with the superior merit of **Rejoicing** (*anumodanā*) and **Great Compassion**, which surpass even material offerings in their capacity to generate Buddhahood.

### 1. The Power of a Single Moment (Ekakṣaṇa)

The method of worship has been stated. From where is it known that this causes the increase of merit? From the *Ārya-Avalokana Sūtra*:

> "He avoids the eight inopportune births (*akṣaṇa*)¹ taught by me,
> And he obtains the one opportune moment (*kṣaṇa*), a beautiful arising of a Buddha.
>
> Endowed with color, possessed of form, adorned with marks,
> Endowed with strength and power, he never falls into laziness.
> Wealthy, possessed of great riches, unassailable, and meritorious—
> Having pleased the Lamp of the World, he honors him again and again."

### 2. Benefits of Stūpa Circumambulation (Pradakṣiṇā)

> "It is not possible to exhaust the praise, even in kotis of kalpas,
> Of the man who would perform circumambulation of the Lord of the World's stūpa.
>
> He never becomes blind or crippled, for kotis of kalpas—
> He who, having generated the Awakening Mind (*bodhicitta*), worships the Teacher's stūpa.
>
> Firm in vigor, firm in stamina, heroic, firm in valor,
> He goes quickly to skillfulness (*kauśalya*), having done circumambulation of the stūpa."

### 3. Benefits of Offerings

#### A. Flowers (Puṣpa)
> "He who takes a flower-handful (*puṣpamuṣṭi*) and with an uplifted mind (*udagracitta*)
> Scatters it over the Lord of the World out of faith—
> He becomes meritorious in the human world,
> And having stood in protection, honors the Victor."

#### B. Garlands (Mālā)
> "Having given a garland to the stūpa, he is born among the Thirty-Three Gods.
> He obtains a divine lotus-pond...
> He becomes a Wheel-Turning King (*Cakravartin*), and Śakra, and Brahmā."

#### C. Incense (Dhūpa)
> "He who would offer incense—even smaller than a mustard seed—to the Lord's shrines:
> He wanders in all directions, free from disease, firm in mind, heedful.
> He dispels sorrow... he becomes dear to the multitude."

#### D. Robes (Cīvara) and Flags (Dhvaja/Patākā)
> "He becomes possessor of beautiful robes... golden colored...
> Having given a flag, he defeats the dust of passion... he obtains abundant wealth."

#### E. Lamps (Dīpa)
> "It is not possible to measure the life and glory
> Of one who offers a single lamp to the Buddha-stūpa.
> He attains the Eye... He obtains illumination (*ālokaprāpta*)."

#### F. Music (Vādya) and Parasols (Chatra)
> "Having offered a parasol... he is never burned by the fire of defilements.
> Having offered music... he obtains a melodious voice (*manojñaghoṣa*)."

### 4. Cleaning the Stūpa (Stūpa-saṃśodhana)

> "He who removes withered flowers from the shrine...
> He abandons attachment, hatred, and delusion.
> He abandons all diseases... He attains the unequaled state of a Buddha."

### 5. The Superior Merit of the Mind

The *Ratnarāśi Sūtra* contrasts material offerings with the mind of omniscience:

> "If all beings in the three worlds were to build stūpas as high as Mount Sumeru...
> And if a bodhisattva who **never lacks the Mind of Omniscience** (*avirahitasarvajñatācitta*) were to offer just a single flower...
> This produces greater merit than that previous heap of merit."

And regarding lamps:
> "If a bodhisattva who has left the household life makes a wick soaked in oil and offers it...
> The previous offering of lamps [by worldly kings] does not approach even a hundredth part of this wick."

### 6. The Benefits of Rejoicing (Anumodanā)

The *Prajñāpāramitā Sūtra* establishes the supremacy of **Rejoicing**:

> "If a son or daughter of good family rejoices in the arising of the thought (*cittotpāda*) of bodhisattvas... how much merit does he produce?
>
> The Lord said: 'It might be possible, Kauśika, to measure the weight of the Trisāhasra world system... but not to measure the merit of rejoicing.'
>
> Those who do not know this merit of rejoicing act on the side of Māra.
> Those who rejoice will quickly please the Tathāgatas. They will not see unpleasant forms... they will be born in heaven."

### 7. The Final Weighing

The text concludes by weighing the merit of the four dhyānas (meditations) against the merit of rejoicing:

> "Subhūti, if all beings were to establish themselves in supreme awakening and practice the four dhyānas for eons...
>
> And if a bodhisattva... were to rejoice in the aggregate of morality, concentration, and wisdom (*śīla-samādhi-prajñā-skandha*) of all Buddhas, Pratyekabuddhas, and Śrāvakas... and dedicate it to supreme awakening...
>
> The previous heap of merit does not approach even a hundredth part of this merit of rejoicing."

Thus, the greatest increase of merit comes from:
1.  **Bodhicitta** (The Mind of Awakening).
2.  **Great Compassion** (*Mahākaruṇā*).
3.  **Rejoicing** (*Anumodanā*) in the good of others.

## Scholarly Notes

1.  **Eight Akṣaṇas**: The eight inopportune births where one cannot hear the Dharma: hells, hungry ghosts, animals, long-lived gods, border regions, imperfect faculties, wrong views, and a world without a Buddha.
2.  **Stūpa**: The architectural embodiment of the Buddha's Dharmakāya. Worship here is not idolatry but a technique for *buddhānusmṛti* (recollection of the Buddha).
3.  **Pradakṣiṇā**: Circumambulation (keeping the object to one's right). A sign of supreme respect common in Indian culture.
4.  **Avalokana Sūtra**: A key text for lay devotion, detailing the karmic results of simple ritual acts.
5.  **Rejoicing**: This is the "economizer" of the Mahāyāna. By rejoicing in the merit of Buddhas, one cognitively participates in their infinite good, thereby generating immense merit without physical resources.
