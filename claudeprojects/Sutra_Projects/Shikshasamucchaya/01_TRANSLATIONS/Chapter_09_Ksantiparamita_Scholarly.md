# Chapter 9: Perfection of Patience (Kṣāntipāramitā)
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

---

*The ninth chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on the Perfection of Patience. Contains the famous Sarvadharmasukhākrānta samādhi teaching—how the bodhisattva attains a concentration where all dharmas are pervaded by happiness, feeling pleasure even under torture.*

---

## Introduction

Thus, protecting the constantly arising, highly pleasant arising of immorality, and removing the bondage of karma-obstruction, one should strive for the purification of afflictions.¹

---

## Part I: The Kārikā 20 Teaching

Therein, at first:

> **One should be patient.** (Kārikā 20a)

For the impatient one's vigor regarding learning and the rest is obstructed, since he cannot bear unweariness.² And one without learning does not know the method of concentration, nor the method of affliction-purification.

Therefore, unwearied:

> **One should approach learning.** (Kārikā 20b)

Even through knowledge, concentration is difficult for one whose conduct is mixed.

> **Therefore one should resort to the forest.** (Kārikā 20c)

Even there, the mind of one not devoted to calming distraction is not concentrated.

> **One should apply oneself to concentration.** (Kārikā 20d)

And for the concentrated one, there is no fruit other than affliction-purification.

> **One should cultivate the foul and the rest.** (Kārikā 20e)

Thus, these are the heading-words (*uddeśapada*) for affliction-purification.

---

## Part II: The Three Types of Patience

Now the exposition is stated.³ Therein, patience is threefold, as stated in the Dharmasaṃgītisūtra:

1. **Patience of enduring suffering** (*duḥkhādhivāsanakṣānti*)
2. **Patience of contemplating dharmas** (*dharmanidhyānakṣānti*)
3. **Patience of bearing harm from others** (*parāpakāramarṣaṇakṣānti*)

Therein, the opponent of patience of enduring suffering is:
- From the arrival of the undesired: **suffering-wailing** (*duḥkhamīrutā*)
- From the obstruction of the desired: **clinging to pleasure** (*sukhābhiṣvaṅga*)

From these two arises sorrow, from that arise hatred and depression.

---

## Part III: Non-Attachment to Pleasure, Non-Aversion to Pain

Hence He states in the Candrapradīpasūtra:⁴

> "Non-attachment to pleasure. Non-aversion to pain."

In the Ratnameghasūtra too:

> "These internal sorrows, lamentations, sufferings, sorrows, and disturbances—these he endures, tolerates."

---

## Part IV: The Eight Worldly Dharmas

In the Āryaugradattaparipṛcchā too:⁵

> "Moreover, O householder, a householder bodhisattva should be free from attraction and repulsion, unstained by the eight worldly dharmas.
>
> By gain, by gain of wife and son, by gain of wealth, grain, and possessions—he should not be elated, should not be overjoyed.
>
> And in all misfortunes, by this one he should not be cast down. He should not be sorrowful.
>
> And thus he should contemplate: 'All conditioned things are magically created, characterized by the presence of disappearance. These—mother, father, son, wife, female servant, male servant, worker, employee, friend, relative, kin—are produced by karma-ripening. These are not mine, I am not theirs.'"

---

## Part V: Verses on Remedy and Sorrow

Moreover:⁶

> *If there is indeed a remedy, what use is sorrow?*
> *Even in remedy, the sorrowful one, faint with anger, is confused.*
>
> *Or, depressed, with killed vigor, he is seized by the opponent's misfortune.*
> *By that worry, his short life goes vainly, moment by moment.*
>
> *Therefore, by practice, one should abandon this useless, harm-bringing [affliction].*

And how is abandonment of sorrow practiced? By relinquishing the light, delicate mind.

As stated in the Ugradattaparipṛcchā:

> "Gone is the cotton-fluff-likeness of the mind."

---

## Part VI: The Three Minds from Gaṇḍavyūha

In the Āryagaṇḍavyūha too:⁷

> "A **difficult-to-conquer mind**, O girl, should be generated for the destruction of all afflictions.
>
> An **unconquered mind** for the breaking through of all attachments.
>
> An **imperturbable mind** for those gone into the ocean-whirlpools of corrupt intentions."

---

## Part VII: Nothing Difficult for Practice

And there is nothing called difficult for practice.⁸ For even among the most foolish—burden-carriers, fishermen, farmers—by practice of suffering, in even trivial matters, the mind marked with hardened calluses is not overcome by discouragement.

How much more so in work whose fruit is the attainment of the unsurpassed state of all saṃsāra-happiness, all bodhisattva-happiness!

Likewise, even ordinary people, toward those who harm them slightly—though themselves destroyed by their own misdeeds—fight even unto death, willing to experience even the intense pain of blows.

How much more should there be vigor for striking and bearing of suffering toward affliction-enemies:
- Who harm over long periods
- Who steal even a fragment of the wealth of suffering-obtained wholesomeness
- Who do not kill in hell but make one wander
- Who destroy the door and direction of escape
- Who cause greater harm even in favorable [conditions]
- Who are enemies though one has done them no harm
- Who are firmly-bound enemies for immeasurable kalpas

Especially for one who has bound on armor for conquering the three worlds, fighting for the release of the world-captive seized by the Māra-hunter!

---

## Part VIII: The Sarvadharmasukhākrānta Samādhi

And just as by practice, beings have perceptions of suffering and pleasure—so by practicing the arising of the perception of pleasure in all arising of suffering, the perception of pleasure alone arises.⁹

This is the outflow-fruit (*niṣyandaphala*): one attains the concentration called **Sarvadharmasukhākrānta** ("All-Dharmas-Pervaded-by-Happiness").

For it is stated in the Pitāputrasamāgama:¹⁰

> "There is, O Blessed One, a concentration called Sarvadharmasukhākrānta. By the attainment of that concentration, the bodhisattva experiences only pleasant feeling in all object-matters, not unpleasant-nor-pleasant.
>
> For him, even when hellish torture is being done, the perception of pleasure alone arises.
>
> Even when human torture is being done—when hands are being cut off, when feet, when ears, when nose are being cut off—the perception of pleasure alone arises.
>
> Even when being beaten with rods, with half-rods, with whips—the perception of pleasure alone proceeds.
>
> Even when thrown into prison...
>
> Even when being boiled in oil, or being pounded like sugarcane, or being pressed like reeds, or being burned with oil-lamps, or being burned with butter-lamps, or being burned with yogurt-lamps—the perception of pleasure alone arises.
>
> Even when being carried with a torch in the mouth, when being carried with a 'lion's happiness' [torture], when being wrapped with dry wicks...
>
> Even when being cut coin-by-coin, when being cooked like flour, when being trampled by elephants—the perception of pleasure alone proceeds.
>
> Even when eyes are being plucked out, even when being impaled alive, even when the whole body is being struck and the head is being split—the perception of pleasure alone proceeds, not the perception of suffering, not the perception of neither-suffering-nor-pleasure.
>
> Why is that? For thus, the bodhisattva mahāsattva practicing the practice for a long time had this aspiration:
>
> 'Those who would feed me—may they become attainers of the happiness of calm and peace.
>
> Those who would protect me, honor me, make me weighty, respect me, worship me—may all of them become attainers of the happiness of peace.
>
> Those who would revile me, strike me, injure me, cut me with weapons, even kill me—may all of them become attainers of the happiness of awakening, may they awaken to unsurpassed perfect awakening.'
>
> He, endowed with these mental applications, by this karma, endowed with these aspirations, cultivates, practices, develops, and multiplies the perception of pleasure following all beings. By the ripening of that karma, he attains the concentration called Sarvadharmasukhākrānta.
>
> At that time when the bodhisattva has attained the concentration called Sarvadharmasukhākrānta, at that time he becomes imperturbable, unassailable by all Māra-works."

## Part IX: The Supreme Practice

For this practice fulfills all relinquishment, accomplishes all difficult practices, makes firm all patience, brings all vigor to non-failure, and is the equipment of all meditation and wisdom limbs.¹¹

Therefore, one should always be joyful. As He states in the Candrapradīpasūtra:

> *With respect, with pleased mind, he should always be;*
> *he should always stand with gentle gaze.*

---

## Part X: The Qualities of Joy (Muditā)

As stated in the Akṣayamatisūtra:¹²

> "What is joy (*muditā*)? Whatever is joy, faith, gladness, non-depression, non-oppression, non-affliction of mind from recollecting the Dharma; the pulling away from all desire-delights, the establishment in all Dharma-delights; the gladness of mind, the exuberance of body, the delighting of understanding, the uplifting of mind; the delighting in the Tathāgata-body, the skill in seeking the adornments of marks and signs; the unweariness in hearing wholesome dharmas; the joy, faith, and gladness from the practice of taking the ultimate Dharma as refuge—the Dharma-uplifting of the joyful one.
>
> Constant unobstructed understanding toward beings; intense desire; non-abandonment of that Dharma-desire in seeking Buddha-dharmas; faith in excellent Buddha-dharmas; liberation; mind-arising pulled away from partial-vehicle [teachings]; mind-arising not contracted by stinginess; desire to give what is asked for; when giving and having given, the rejoicing in gifts purified in the three circles (*trimaṇḍalapariśuddha*).
>
> Constant faith in the morally disciplined; joyful grace toward the immorally-disciplined; relief surpassing all bad odors by purification of one's own morality; dedication to Tathāgata-morality; firm unbreakability; unobstructed mind toward harsh, ill-mannered speech-paths of others; patience-gentleness; humility.
>
> Respect, bowing, appreciation toward teachers; always smile-faced; gone from frowning; speaking first; non-deceitfulness; not striving for what should not be strived for; pure intention; non-hardness of mind; non-crookedness; seeing benefit everywhere; examining one's own stumbling; self-accusation in offenses; conforming to endearing dharmas.
>
> Teacher-love toward bodhisattvas; self-love toward dharmas; life-love toward Tathāgatas; parent-love toward teachers; child-love toward beings; Buddha-love toward ācāryas and preceptors; head-and-limbs-love toward practices; hand-and-feet-love toward the perfections; all-jewel-love toward Dharma-preachers; all-delight-and-play-love toward instructions.
>
> Health-love toward contentment; medicine-love toward Dharma-seeking; physician-love toward counselors and reminders."

Thus, whatever is non-depression of all faculties—this is called joy (*muditā*).

---

## Part XI: Hell-Bound Resolve

And here, this statement adorns trained bodhisattvas.¹³ As stated in the Āryamahāmegha:

> "They are those whose minds are constantly concentrated on the hell-destiny; they are those who love the hell-destiny; they are those who are merchants sailing to the hell-destiny. They are those who desire hell; they are those who are stingy-greedy for hell; they are those whose minds are attuned to hell-fire."

Patience of enduring suffering has been stated.

---

## Part XII: The Āryasāgaramatisūtra Teaching

In the Āryasāgaramatisūtra, all three types of patience are stated:¹⁴

> "Here, O Sāgaramati, the bodhisattva mahāsattva, regarding the jewel of the omniscience-mind-arising, being harassed, disturbed, shaken, threatened, struck by ignoble, immoral beings, by Māras, by Māra-realm deities, by Māra-possessed [beings], or by Māra-messengers—he is not broken from that arising of sincere-intention-mind.
>
> He is not broken due to the vigor-undertaking of great compassion for the liberation of all beings.
>
> He is not broken due to the exertion for the non-interruption of the Three Jewel lineage.
>
> He is not broken due to the wholesome application of bringing together all dharmas.
>
> He is not broken due to the accumulation of the merit-equipment for the accomplishment of marks and signs.
>
> He is not broken due to the eagerness drawn from the aspiration for buddha-field purification.
>
> He is not broken due to the relinquishment of body and life devoted to the non-grasping of all dharmas.
>
> He is not broken due to the non-reliance on self-happiness devoted to the ripening of all beings.
>
> He, being thus endowed with sincere intention, bears the looking-down of all beings.
>
> He bears the contempt of all beings.
>
> He bears the reviling, abuse, and harsh, ill-mannered speech-paths of all beings.
>
> He bears the oppression of all beings.
>
> He bears the burdens of all beings and raises them up.
>
> He is not wearied. He is not depressed. He does not shrink. He does not despair.
>
> He displays strength. He generates firmness. He undertakes vigor. He exerts exertion. He generates enthusiasm. He restrains the disturbed mind.
>
> **He, reviled, does not revile in return.**
>
> **He, struck, does not strike in return.**
>
> **He, provoked to anger, does not provoke in return.**
>
> **He, angered at, does not become angry in return.**"

---

## Part XIII: The Armor of Mind-Computation

And thus he binds on the armor of mind-computation:¹⁵

> "If all these beings in the ten directions who are being oppressed were all to pursue me from behind with swords, spears, javelins, and clubs—in whatever place on earth I stand, sit, walk, or lie and generate bodhicitta, or generosity-mind, up to wisdom-mind, or learning-root-of-virtue-mind—in that place on earth they would cut my body into pieces the size of a jujube leaf, would wound it, would destroy it.
>
> Even if all those beings were to revile me, abuse me, disdain me, disparage me, utter false words, harsh words, being established in harm-doing actions, cut my body into pieces the size of a jujube leaf, wound it, destroy it—thus I should not generate a hostile mind toward any being.
>
> Why is that? The beginningless beginning of saṃsāra is made immeasurable, wherein this person of mine—whether gone to hell, gone to animal birth, gone to the Yama-world, gone to the human world, as one who swallows meat of desire, as one who has not heard the Dharma, as one whose livelihood-pasture is corrupt, as one whose life is purposeless—has been cut a hundredfold, part by part, wounded, and tortured by various tortures.
>
> And from that as cause, neither my own purpose was accomplished nor others' purpose.
>
> If, however, all these beings were to cut, wound, scatter, and destroy me to the end of the future—still, omniscience is not to be abandoned by me. All beings are not to be abandoned. The wholesome Dharma-desire is not to be abandoned.
>
> Why is that? For all this bodily oppression, bodily transformation does not equal even a hundredth part of hellish suffering, does not approach even the semblance. I am able to bear even dwelling in hell. But the Buddha-dharmas are not to be abandoned by me, nor the great compassion with all beings as object."

---

## Part XIV: Abandoning Body-Clinging

> "Whatever is the cause from which ill-will arises—that dharma we will abandon. And what is that dharma? Namely: body-love, body-nest, body-reliance.¹⁶
>
> The body is relinquished; ill-will is relinquished.
>
> Thus, the bodhisattva, O Sāgaramati, stationed in Dharma-computation, bears the oppression of all beings."

---

## Part XV: The Six Perfections in Patience

> "What is the relinquishment of the body, the abandonment of the body, the non-regard for the body—this is his **Perfection of Giving**.¹⁷
>
> When the body is being cut, to pervade all beings with loving-kindness, and not to withdraw the feelings—this is his **Perfection of Morality**.
>
> When the body is being cut, to endure precisely for the liberation of those who are cutting his body, and not to be injured in mind, and to display patience-power—this is his **Perfection of Patience**.
>
> The vigor by which he does not abandon that omniscience-desire, takes hold of mind-power-commitment, and pursues saṃsāra itself, and undertakes the undertaking of roots of virtue alone—this is his **Perfection of Vigor**.
>
> When the body is being scattered, not to be confused regarding making that omniscience-mind-arising-jewel, to contemplate awakening alone, to examine the peaceful and calmed alone—this is his **Perfection of Meditation**.
>
> When the body is being cut, to examine the grass-wood-wall-like appearance of the body, to enter the dream-nature of the body, to contemplate the true impermanence, true suffering, true non-self, and true peace of the body—this is his **Perfection of Wisdom**."

---

## Part XVI: The Lazy Being

Moreover, thus he thinks:¹⁸

> "This being is lazy, devoid of white dharmas. He reviles me, abuses me. Come! We shall become those of undertaken vigor, unsatisfied, devoted to seeking roots of virtue.
>
> This very being should first be caused to sit on the seat of awakening by me. Afterwards, unsurpassed perfect awakening should be awakened to by me.
>
> For such beings as these—untamed, unguarded, uncalmed—armors should be bound on by us."

---

## Part XVII: Searching for Self and Other

> "Come! We will resort to the Dharmatā. Who reviles, or is reviled? Searching, he does not find that dharma—the one who reviles or is reviled.¹⁹
>
> He, with the view of non-apprehension of self and other removed, is patient."

---

## Part XVIII: The Prajñāpāramitā Teaching

In the Bhagavatī too:²⁰

> "Thus he generates the mind: 'I, by whom the dispute of all beings is to be removed—I myself am disputing! My gains are ill-gotten, that I am speaking back when spoken to. I, by whom a bridge for all beings is to be made—I speak even the word "you" to another, or give a harsh reply.
>
> This should not be spoken by me, being like a dumb fool. In quarrels and disputes, I should be like a deaf-mute sheep.
>
> Hearing harsh, ill-mannered, ill-spoken speech-paths being spoken by others, I should not injure my mind.
>
> It is not good or proper for me to generate fault-finding toward another. It is not proper for me even to hear of another's fault-finding.
>
> Why is that? My intention is not to be corrupted, for by me all beings are to be made happy with all happiness-provisions, and are to be brought to parinirvāṇa, having awakened to unsurpassed perfect awakening. There I should not be ill-willed.
>
> Nor should I be ill-willed toward others even for their own offenses. I will be going to delusion, to hostility!
>
> But this should be done by me: I should exert with firm exertion. Not even when life-obstruction is being made should agitation be made by me. I should not raise a frown on my face.'"

---

## Part XIX: Soothing the Angry

In the Bodhisattvaprātimokṣa too:²¹

> "Those beings who are angry—he soothes them, makes them patient, makes them conformable, satisfies them with the Dharma."

---

*Thus ends the Ninth Chapter, the Perfection of Patience, in the Śikṣāsamuccaya.*
