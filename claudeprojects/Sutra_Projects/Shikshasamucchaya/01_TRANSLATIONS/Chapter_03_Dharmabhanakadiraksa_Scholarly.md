# Chapter 3: Protection of Dharma-Preachers and Others (Dharmabhāṇakādirakṣā)
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

---

*The third chapter of Śāntideva's Compendium of Training, on protecting Dharma-teachers and avoiding the various harms that assail the bodhisattva's path.*

---

## Introduction: The General Method of Protection

The method of protection and so forth for all three [i.e., person, enjoyments, merit] has been stated in general. Now the particulars of protection must be explained.¹

### Kārikā 7

> **tatrātmabhāve kā rakṣā yadanarthavivarjanam |**

*"Therein, what is the protection of one's person? It is the avoidance of harm."*²

Here, "therein" refers to one who abides in the embracing of the true Dharma [from Chapter 2]. The protection of one's person is to be considered as how one does not destroy others.³

---

## Part I: The Vow of the Dharma-Holders

This teaching on the avoidance of harm was spoken by bodhisattvas devoted to upholding the true Dharma in the Āryagaganagañjasūtra:⁴

> "We venture, O Blessed One, after the extinction of the Foremost Among Bipeds,
> We shall uphold the true Dharma, having abandoned body and life.
>
> Having relinquished gain and honor, having cast off all praise,
> Not relinquishing this Dharma that reveals the Buddha's wisdom.
>
> Abuse and harsh criticism, and words of ill-speaking—
> Through patience we shall endure them, for the sake of embracing the true Dharma.
>
> Raised fists and threats, and defamation and disgrace—
> All these we shall endure, upholding this method...
>
> In such a dreadful time of great danger, when monks are in want and distressed,
> In the time of devastation for beings, we shall uphold the true Dharma.
>
> Those profound sūtrāntas connected with the fruit of liberation—
> Those who accept them will not break; they will brush aside confused talk...
>
> Loving-kindness we shall practice toward those who are not established in the Dharma,
> And compassion we shall practice, upholding this method.
>
> Having seen beings of bad conduct, established in desire and greed,
> We shall shed tears—for where will such ones be reborn?
>
> And having seen just such an obstructor of the true Dharma,
> We shall befriend him from afar, lest he become angry with us.
>
> We shall protect as we are able, restrained in speech and action,
> We shall not suddenly address those who are established in their own evil.
>
> With gifts and also with respect, we shall ripen such persons here;
> And we shall urge them toward truth, away from the domain of evil.
>
> Having abandoned household production, wandering in the edges of the wilderness,
> We shall be like deer—with few concerns, with few tasks...
>
> Tamed, peaceful, and liberated, and having descended into a village,
> We shall teach the Dharma to beings who are seekers of Dharma.
>
> Even far we shall go, having heard of those who desire the Dharma,
> Having attained the delight in the Dharma-garden, we shall accomplish the welfare of the embodied.
>
> Having seen face to face the abundant stumbling of beings,
> We shall be self-observant, established in kindness toward the Dharma.
>
> Whether dishonored or honored, like Mount Meru established,
> Untainted by the world, we shall become guides for the world.
>
> Having heard the censure of monks whose conduct has split,
> We shall mind our own actions—may their karma not ripen [for us].
>
> They will hire assassins for those who abide in these dharmas—
> 'These dharmas are nowhere to be found among us!'
>
> 'Our śramaṇas have no śramaṇa qualities!'—
> Having heard true accusation, they reject this sūtra.
>
> For those whose ears and noses are cut off, how is a mirror pleasing?
> Having heard true accusation, they reject the true Dharma.
>
> Those monks who will embrace the true Dharma—
> They will strive so that someone may hear this Dharma.
>
> Kings will seize them, and great multitudes will break them;
> Through the Buddha's empowerment, beings will then hear this Dharma.
>
> In that harsh time, we, having abandoned body and life,
> Shall uphold the true Dharma, for the sake of beings' welfare."

## Part II: The Saddharmapuṇḍarīka Teaching

In the Āryasaddharmapuṇḍarīka it is also stated:⁵

> "One should protect one's conduct and sphere of activity; one should be unassociated and pure.
> One should always avoid intimacy with princes and kings.
>
> And also with the men of kings—one should not be intimate with them;
> With outcasts, boxers, drunkards, and all manner of sectarians.
>
> One should not serve those who are conceited, [even if] established in Vinaya and Āgama,
> Monks thought to be arhats—but the ill-conducted one should be avoided.
>
> The bhikṣuṇī should always be avoided whose sphere is laughter and gossip;
> And the upāsikās who are exposed and unsettled should be avoided.
>
> Women and hermaphrodites—intimacy with them should be avoided;
> And in households, young brides and maidens should be avoided.
>
> One should never befriend them or ask them 'How are you?' skillfully;
> And intimacy should be avoided with pig-dealers and sheep-dealers.
>
> Those who support women—intimacy with them should be avoided;
> With actors, jugglers, wrestlers, and all such people.
>
> One should not serve courtesans or others who live by entertainment;
> Greeting such persons should be entirely avoided.
>
> And when the wise one teaches the Dharma to women,
> One should not enter alone there, nor should one indulge in laughter."

---

## Part III: The Works of Māra

This is another harm that there would be—namely, what is called the work of Māra, stated in the Prajñāpāramitā:⁶

> "Māra the Evil One will zealously exert great effort near the bodhisattva who has recently set out in the Vehicle."

Here also it is said:⁷

> "Furthermore, Ānanda, at whatever time a bodhisattva mahāsattva applies himself to the Prajñāpāramitā, at that time the Māras, the Evil Ones, bring forth harassment of the bodhisattva; they generate fear.
>
> They let loose and display meteor-falls and conflagrations in all directions, [thinking:] 'Perhaps this bodhisattva mahāsattva will become discouraged, or perhaps his hair will stand on end!'—by which even one of his thought-moments might be diminished regarding supreme perfect enlightenment.
>
> Furthermore, others of different awareness will write [it] down... [and] acquire it. [Saying:] 'We are not obtaining any taste from this!'—they will rise from their seats and depart. Thus yawning, laughing... they will acquire it. This is the work of Māra.
>
> Thus, thoughts about the countryside, villages, and so forth will arise. Thus, mental attention to teachers, preceptors, mothers, fathers, friends, ministers, relatives, and blood-relations [will arise]. Thus, mental attention to thieves [will arise]. Thus, mental attention to robes and so forth [will arise].
>
> Furthermore, the Dharma-preacher will be eager to have someone copy, or recite, this profound Prajñāpāramitā, but the Dharma-hearer will become diseased. Or vice versa. The Dharma-preacher will wish to go to another region, but the Dharma-hearers will say no to this.
>
> Thus, the Dharma-preacher will be of great desire, while the Dharma-hearer is of few desires—this is not right. In brief, whatever discord there is between Dharma-preacher and Dharma-hearer, all of that is said to be the work of Māra."

---

## Part IV: The Ten Māra-Hooks

In the Āryagaganagañjasūtra it is also stated:⁸

> "Indeed, whatever continuance in unwholesome dharmas there is, and whatever abandonment of wholesome dharmas—all of that is the work of Māra."

In the Āryasāgaramatisūtra it also says:⁹

> "Furthermore, O Blessed One, the bodhisattva who is a forest-dweller, delighting in secluded lodgings, is of few desires, content, secluded, unassociated with householders and renunciants. Because of having few concerns and few tasks, he dwells happily, yet he is not diligent in seeking vast learning, nor does he consider it necessary to cross over to ripen beings, or in the hearing of Dharma, in Dharma-talk, in definitive-meaning discourse.
>
> He is not of the nature of inquiry; he is not devoted to 'What is skillful?' His afflictions do not operate because of his forest-dwelling and because of his single-taste delight. He finds satisfaction merely in the suppression of active defilements. He does not cultivate the path for the eradication of latent tendencies.
>
> Thus he is not practicing for his own benefit or for the benefit of others. This, O Blessed One, is the bodhisattva's **seventh Māra-hook** connected with forest-dwelling...
>
> Furthermore, O Blessed One, the bodhisattva serves, resorts to, and attends upon evil friends who appear to be spiritual friends. They, having diverted him from the means of attraction, having diverted him from the accumulation of merit, from embracing the true Dharma, they engage him in seclusion; they engage him in having few concerns and few tasks. They teach him discourses connected with the Śrāvaka and Pratyekabuddha [vehicles].
>
> And at whatever time the bodhisattva, through dwelling in seclusion, would advance in the Great Vehicle, at that time they engage that bodhisattva in the disturbance of service [to others]. 'Service must certainly be done by a bodhisattva!' And at whatever time the bodhisattva should be engaged in service, at that time they engage him in seclusion.
>
> Thus they say to him: 'Enlightenment is for one of aroused vigor, not for one who is lazy. And if you do not awaken to supreme perfect enlightenment in eight or nine kalpas, you will no longer be capable of awakening to supreme perfect enlightenment.'
>
> There, O Blessed One, it is possible that through excessively aroused vigor the bodhisattva might attain the fruit of nirvāṇa [as an arhat]. This, O Blessed One, is the bodhisattva's **tenth Māra-hook** from those appearing as spiritual friends.
>
> Those who are also Mahāyāna persons, unknowing of the Māra-hooks, who practice dharmas that have been turned away from—with them he finds pleasure. For they become followers of that [path], and the one who resorts to the inferior, not having attained distinction, goes to an inferior destiny—namely, a desert destiny, a destiny of dullness and muteness...up to the **eleventh Māra-hook**."

---

## Part V: The Right Kind of Vigor

Because of this [danger], continuous aroused vigor produces disenchantment with the bodhisattva-state in all ways. Therefore, as stated in the Ratnamegha:¹⁰

> "Here the bodhisattva arouses vigor in all postures. And he arouses it in such a way that he does not generate bodily fatigue, nor mental fatigue. This is called the bodhisattva's continuous vigor.
>
> What kind of vigor is it by which fatigue does not occur? Namely, the undertaking of heavy work by one of little strength, or at an excessive time, or the undertaking of difficult work by one whose aspiration is not yet ripened—such as the giving of one's own flesh, and so forth.
>
> Moreover, one's person has been given. But he [the bodhisattva] prevents it from being consumed at the wrong time. For otherwise, through the bodhisattva's fatigue, through the destruction of the bodhicitta-seed for those very beings, there would be destruction of a great mass of fruit."

Thus in the Gaganagañjasūtra it is also stated:¹¹

> "Expectation of [gifts given] before the proper time is the work of Māra."

---

## Part VI: Protection of One's Person

Nor should the giving up of one's person be left unproduced just because it is not the [proper] time. For without undertaking practice, one would never give.¹² Therefore, having established mindfulness thus, one's person should be protected from:

- Those who contradict the ripening of bodhicitta
- Those who through delusion destroy one's own welfare
- Flesh-eaters [carnivorous beings]¹³
- Those who do karma [harmful agents]

### Kārikā 8 (verse from source)

> *"Just as the seed of the well-appearing medicine tree,*
> *whose root and so forth are to be enjoyed—*
> *even having given it, it should be protected from untimely consumption:*
> *just so the medicine tree of the Fully Awakened One."*¹⁴

This is, in brief, the harm that is the work of Māra.

---

## Part VII: Dispelling the Works of Māra

The dispelling of this is stated in the Ratnameghasūtra:¹⁵

> "And how, O son of good family, does the bodhisattva become skillful in the method of avoiding the work of Māra? Here, the bodhisattva entirely avoids unwholesome friends. He entirely avoids dwelling in an unsuitable place, the cultivation of service to worldly sciences and mantras, [excessive preoccupation with] gain, honor, reverence, service, and esteem.
>
> And whatever other secondary afflictions there are that obstruct the path to the factors of enlightenment—all these he entirely avoids. And he cultivates the antidotes to those."

---

## Part VIII: Characteristics of Unwholesome Friends

Here also the characteristic of an unwholesome friend is stated:¹⁶

> "The avoidance of evil friends is to be known through the avoidance of persons whose morality has failed. Likewise through avoidance of persons whose view has failed, whose conduct has failed, whose livelihood has failed. Through avoidance of persons who delight in communal life. Through avoidance of lazy persons. Through avoidance of persons who take pleasure in saṃsāra. Through avoidance of persons who have turned away from enlightenment. Through avoidance of association with householders—the avoidance of evil friends is to be known.
>
> And, O son of good family, by one avoiding these circumstances, a hostile mind should not be produced toward those persons, nor an angry mind, nor a contemptuous mind.
>
> Thus his mind should be established. For it was said by the Blessed One: 'Beings, according to their element—desire-element and so forth—flow together, are born, and stream forth; through association they are destroyed. Therefore I shall avoid association.'"

---

## Part IX: Confusion of Bodhicitta

The confusion of bodhicitta is also a harm.¹⁷ And its cause is stated in the Ratnakūṭa:

> "By four dharmas, O Kāśyapa, the bodhisattva's bodhicitta becomes confused. What are the four?
>
> 1. Through deceiving teachers, guides, and those worthy of gifts;
> 2. Through generating remorse in others who have no remorse;
> 3. Through spreading defamation and disgrace about beings who have set out in the Mahāyāna;
> 4. Through approaching others with deceit and cunning, not with superior intention."

---

## Part X: Avoidance of Bodhicitta Confusion

The avoidance of this is also stated here:¹⁸

> "By four dharmas, O Kāśyapa, the bodhisattva's bodhicitta becomes manifest in all births from the moment of birth; it does not become confused in between, up until sitting at the seat of enlightenment. What are the four?
>
> 1. He does not speak a deliberate lie even for the sake of [preserving] life—not even for the sake of laughter;
> 2. He stands before all beings with superior intention, having abandoned deceit and cunning;
> 3. He generates the perception of Teacher regarding all bodhisattvas;
> 4. He proclaims their praise in the four directions.
>
> And whatever beings he ripens, all of them he establishes in supreme perfect enlightenment, through non-aspiration to partial vehicles. By these four, O Kāśyapa..."

---

## Part XI: Dharma-Gift Protection

In the Siṃhaparipṛcchā it also says:¹⁹

> "One who never creates an obstacle to the gift of Dharma—
> By that, one quickly obtains meeting with the World-Protectors.
> Thus from the Dharma-gift one remembers [past] births—know this, O prince!
>
> By that one does not abandon bodhicitta in all births;
> Even in dream, that mind [is present]—how much more when awake!
>
> In whatever places of cessation, villages or cities,
> One takes up [the Dharma] for enlightenment—by that the mind does not abandon [bodhicitta]."

---

## Part XII: Four Dharmas of Non-Falling

In the Āryamañjuśrībuddhakṣetraguṇavyūhālaṃkārasūtra it also says:²⁰

> "Endowed with four dharmas, the bodhisattva does not fall from [his] vow...
> He becomes one whose pride is struck down; he becomes one who avoids jealousy and stinginess; and having seen the success of others, he does not become conceited."

---

## Part XIII: Unwavering Bodhicitta

This very thing—the most clear cause for the non-confusion of the suitable bodhicitta—is what is stated here in the Ratnakūṭa:²¹

> "Through mental cultivation of bodhicitta in all postures, through making bodhicitta foremost."

As the reading in the Candrapradīpasūtra states:²²

> "I declare and announce to you:
> However much a person thinks repeatedly,
> So his mind becomes inclined to those;
> He is supported by those thoughts."

---

## Part XIV: Discouragement as Harm

Discouragement is also a harm.²³ The avoidance of this is seen in the Ratnamegha:

> "Here the bodhisattva does not generate the thought: 'Enlightenment is hard to attain for one who is a human being. And this vigor of mine is small. I am lazy. And enlightenment requires many kalpas, many hundreds of kalpas, many thousands of kalpas, like one whose head is on fire [requiring immediate attention]. I am not capable of shouldering such a burden.'
>
> Rather, the bodhisattva should generate such a thought: 'Whatever tathāgatas, arhats, samyaksaṃbuddhas have awakened, are awakening, or will awaken—they too have awakened, are awakening, and will awaken by just such a method, by just such a practice, by just such vigor.
>
> They were not already in the state of tathāgata when they awakened. I too will strive in the same way, exert myself in the same way, with vigor common to all beings, with vigor that has all beings as its object—so that I may awaken to supreme perfect enlightenment.'"

---

## Part XV: The Bodhisattva's Stumbling

Another harm is seen in the Ratnakūṭa:²⁴

> "Trust in beings who have not been ripened is a stumbling of the bodhisattva. The proclamation of exalted Buddha-dharma to beings who have become unsuitable vessels is a stumbling of the bodhisattva. The proclamation of the Lesser Vehicle to beings of exalted aspiration is a stumbling of the bodhisattva.
>
> Disdain toward those who are properly mindful and endowed with morality and good dharmas, [combined with] gathering those of bad morality and unwholesome dharmas, is a stumbling of the bodhisattva."

---

## Part XVI: Lack of Aspiration as Harm

Lack of aspiration is also a harm.²⁵ As stated in the Rāṣṭrapālasūtra:

> "One for whom aspiration toward the Buddha, Dharma, and Saṅgha does not exist—
> In the training and precepts, for that one there is no aspiration.
> One of evil thought, opening to the three lower destinies—
>
> He, fallen from here, through the force of karma, is among humans, yet ignorant, confused.
> In the hells, in animal destinies, in hungry ghost destinies, he finds suffering."

---

## Part XVII: Avoidance of Lack of Aspiration

The dispelling of this is seen as stated in the Ratnakūṭa:²⁶

> "Regarding those profound [teachings] into which his intellect does not penetrate, he does not reject them, having made the Tathāgata himself the witness: 'The Tathāgata knows thus; I do not know. The Buddha's enlightenment is infinite; through the diversity of aspirations, the teaching of Dharma of the Tathāgatas proceeds to beings.'"

---

## Part XVIII: Skill in Avoiding Harm While Serving

One who is engaged in service should become skillful in avoidance of harm.²⁷ For in the Bodhisattvaprātimokṣa, service is enjoined regarding a fellow practitioner in Dharma-hearing, and regarding worship of the Tathāgata.

The procedure for this has come from the Ratnarāśisūtra:²⁸

> "There, by the monk who performs service, the minds of the entire Saṅgha of monks should be satisfied.
>
> There, for those monks who are forest-dwellers and dwell in secluded lodgings, by the service-performing monk absolutely no assignment of work should be given.
>
> But if work belonging to the Saṅgha, being trainee-work, should fall to a forest-dwelling monk, by this service-performing monk that should be done himself, or another monk should be requested—the forest-dwelling monk should not be oppressed.
>
> For the monk who lives on alms-round, by that service-performing monk a share of excellent food should be given.
>
> For the monk who is a practitioner of yoga, by that service-performing monk suitable requisites should be brought—medicines and equipment for sickness. And in whatever place that yoga-practitioner monk dwells, in that place no loud noise should be made. The yoga-practitioner monk should be protected by the service-performing monk. His bedding and seat should be propped up. Excellent foods, pleasing, suitable for the yoga-practitioner's stage, should be offered...
>
> For those monks who are devoted to vast learning, enthusiasm should be given. They too should be protected. For those monks who will be Dharma-preachers, the manner of reception should be performed. Dharma-hearers should be encouraged. The assembly-circle should be prepared. The discourse-circle should be purified...and one should be abundant in applause...
>
> The perception of lordship should not be produced regarding any matter. Even the smallest task should be done according to the intention of the Saṅgha, not according to one's own intention...
>
> That belonging to the Saṅgha should not be mixed with that belonging to the Saṅgha of the Four Quarters. Likewise the mutual non-mixing with stūpa-property is prohibited...
>
> Whoever, O Kāśyapa, is a service-performing monk [and] with angry mind issues a command to virtuous ones worthy of gifts because of [his sense of] lordship—by that unwholesome karma he becomes one bound for hell...
>
> If one who threatens a monk with punishment through fear—by that unwholesome karma, the hell named Many Terrors becomes his place of rebirth...until his body is pierced by thousands, blazing, burning, aflame...
>
> His tongue becomes extended a hundred yojanas; in that tongue-faculty many hundreds of thousands of blazing iron stakes are driven...
>
> Whoever, O Kāśyapa, is a service-performing monk [and] hoards incoming gains belonging to the Saṅgha, does not give them at proper times, gives while having harassed and troubled, and does not give to some—by that unwholesome root, the hungry ghost destiny called 'Shank' [or 'Leg'], made of excrement and clay, becomes his place of rebirth.
>
> There, other hungry ghosts take food and make it disappear from him. He, being harassed, looking at that food with unblinking eyes, afflicted by hunger and thirst, experiences painful feeling, and even for a thousand years there is no obtaining of that food..."

---

## Part XIX: The Saṃgharakṣita Narrative

In the Saṃgharakṣitāvadāna also, harms are stated:²⁹

> "Those beings whom you, Saṃgharakṣita, saw in the form of walls—they were monks. By them, that which belonged to the Saṅgha—the wall—was destroyed by phlegm. By the ripening of that karma, they became wall-shaped.
>
> Those beings whom you saw in the form of pillars—they were monks. By them, a pillar belonging to the Saṅgha was destroyed by mucus. Therefore they became pillar-shaped.
>
> Those beings whom you saw in the forms of trees, leaves, flowers, fruits—they too were monks. By them, trees, leaves, flowers, and fruits belonging to the Saṅgha were consumed for personal enjoyment. Therefore they became tree-, leaf-, flower-, and fruit-shaped.
>
> Those beings whom you saw in the forms of ropes and brooms—they were monks. By them, ropes and brooms belonging to the Saṅgha were used for personal enjoyment. Therefore they became rope-shaped and broom-shaped.
>
> The being whom you saw in the form of a ladle—he was a novice. He was making porridge-scum. Guest monks had arrived. Seen by them, he was asked: 'Novice, will this porridge be for the Saṅgha?' He, with mind overcome by stinginess, said: 'Don't you see the scum being made? The porridge has been drunk.' They, [thinking] 'The time has passed,' became discouraged and departed with dejected faces. By the ripening of that karma, he became ladle-shaped.
>
> The being whom you saw in the form of a mortar—he too was a monk. Work [grinding] was due for his bowl. And there a single novice, an arhat, was appointed to the grinding of beans. He said to him: 'Novice, give me a little of the chaff for grinding.' He said: 'Venerable one, wait a moment. I am busy. Afterward, having ground it, I will give it.' He, having become angry, said: 'Novice, if I had the power to strike, I would put you in a mortar and pound you—let alone the chaff!'
>
> That novice reflected: 'This one is overcome by intense mental disturbance. If I give him a reply, he will become angry to an even greater degree.' So he remained silent.
>
> When the disturbance had passed, he approached and said: 'Venerable one, do you know who I am?' He said: 'I know you to be a novice who went forth under Kāśyapa the Perfectly Enlightened One. I too am an elder monk.'
>
> The novice said: 'Even though that is so, nevertheless what was to be done by me, having gone forth, has been done. What has been done? The abandonment of afflictions. I, with all bonds cut, am released from all bonds. Harsh speech has been uttered by you. Acknowledge the transgression as a transgression. Perhaps this karma may go to diminution, thinness, and exhaustion.'
>
> By him the transgression was not acknowledged as a transgression. By that karma, he became mortar-shaped."

And so forth through the various forms: pot-shaped, split down the middle being carried by a thread, and others.³⁰

## Key Concepts

- **Anarthavivarjana** (अनर्थविवर्जन): Avoidance of harm
- **Mārakarma** (मारकर्म): Works/deeds of Māra
- **Mārāṅkuśa** (मारांकुश): Māra-hooks (ten traps)
- **Bodhicittasaṃpramoṣa** (बोधिचित्तसंप्रमोष): Confusion/theft of bodhicitta
- **Avasāda** (अवसाद): Discouragement
- **Skhalita** (स्खलित): Stumbling, error
- **Vaiyāvṛtya** (वैयावृत्य): Service (to the Saṅgha)
- **Pāpamitra** (पापमित्र): Evil friend
- **Akālaparibhoga** (अकालपरिभोग): Untimely consumption

---

## Soul-Check Hints for Blues Version

- **"Māra's work" is everywhere**: Discord between teacher and student, impatience, wrong associations, discouragement
- **The Gaganagañja vow is powerful**: Bodhisattvas promise to withstand abuse, hire assassins, kings seizing them
- **Ten Māra-hooks**: Forest-dwelling laziness, false friends urging quick nirvāṇa, association with the fallen
- **The mortar-story is vivid**: A monk who spoke rashly to an arhat-novice became a mortar—acknowledge your transgressions!
