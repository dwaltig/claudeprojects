## The Arising of Bodhicitta in the Great Being

Having encountered such an opportunity, one who has well understood the suffering of saṃsāra from both conventional and ultimate perspectives, and who aspires to the peace of its cessation—through the influence of the Buddha-gotra,¹ this reflection arises in such a great being:

### Verse from [Bodhicaryāvatāra 1.1]²

> **yadā mama pareṣāṃ ca bhayaṃ duḥkhaṃ ca na priyam |**
> **tadātmanaḥ ko viśeṣo yattaṃ rakṣāmi netaram ||**

*When neither fear nor suffering is dear to me or to others, what distinction is there in the self such that I protect it and not the other?*

Thus, for the sake of oneself and the realm of beings:

### Kārikā [2]³

> **duḥkhāntaṃ kartukāmena sukhāntaṃ gantumicchatā |**
> **śraddhāmūlaṃ dṛḍhīkṛtya bodhau kāryā matirdṛḍhā ||**

*By one who wishes to make an end of suffering, by one who desires to reach the culmination of happiness: having made firm the root of faith, a firm resolve toward awakening must be made.*

## The Glory of Faith: Quotation from Ratnolkā-dhāraṇī

As stated in the Ratnolkā-dhāraṇī:⁴

> *By faith one follows the Victors;⁵ by faith one trusts the Victor's Dharma; by faith in the conduct of the Buddha's sons⁶ arises the mind of great beings toward unsurpassed awakening.*
>
> *Faith goes before, like a mother, like a guide; it protects and increases all good qualities. It dispels doubt, ferries one across the flood,⁷ it shows the way, is the forerunner of patience.*
>
> *Faith is the clarity of an undefiled mind; it is the root of respect, free from pride. Faith is the treasure-store of wealth, the chief of good conduct—like a hand, it is the root of gathering virtue.*
>
> *Faith produces joy in giving; faith produces delight in the Buddha-dharma. Faith creates distinction in the knowledge of qualities; it leads one to the Buddha-path.*
>
> *For sharpness and radiance of the faculties—faith is the power. For invincibility—faith. For being unassailable by afflictions—faith in the qualities of the Self-Arisen Ones.*
>
> *Faith is non-attachment to the pleasures of attachment; it avoids unfavorable moments, foremost in [seizing] the opportune moment. Faith crosses beyond the path of Māra;⁸ it shows the supreme path of liberation.*
>
> *Faith is the uncorrupted seed, the cause of qualities; faith makes the bodhi-tree⁹ sprout. It increases wisdom, distinction, and happiness; faith reveals all the Victors.*
>
> *Those who ever have faith and respect for the Buddha—they do not abandon discipline or training. Those who do not abandon discipline or training—they are praised as virtuous, those who possess virtue.*
>
> *Those who ever have faith and respect for the Dharma—they listen insatiably to the Victor's Dharma. Those who listen insatiably to the Victor's Dharma—in them arises conviction in the inconceivable Dharma.*
>
> *Those who ever have faith and respect for the Saṅgha—they are irreversible, devoted to the Saṅgha. Those irreversible, devoted to the Saṅgha—they are irreversible through the power of faith.*
>
> *Those irreversible through the power of faith—their faculties are sharp and radiant. Those whose faculties are sharp and radiant—they have abandoned evil companions.*
>
> *Those who have abandoned evil companions—they embrace dharmic friends.¹⁰ Those who embrace dharmic friends—they accumulate vast merit.*
>
> *Those who accumulate vast merit—they are great beings endowed with the power of causes. Great beings endowed with the power of causes—they have distinguished noble conviction.*
>
> *Those with distinguished noble conviction—they are ever blessed by all the Victors. Those ever blessed by all the Victors—in them arises the mind of awakening.*
>
> *Those in whom arises the mind of awakening—they are devoted to the qualities of the great ṛṣis. Those devoted to the qualities of the great ṛṣis—they are born in the Buddha-family, well-born.*
>
> *Those born in the Buddha-family, well-born—they are freed from [wrong] connection and disconnection. Those freed from connection and disconnection—their disposition is purified with clarity.*
>
> *Those whose disposition is purified with clarity—their higher disposition is supreme and excellent. Those whose higher disposition is supreme—they ever practice the perfections.*
>
> *Those who ever practice the perfections—they have entered the Great Vehicle here. Those who have entered the Great Vehicle—they worship the Buddhas through practice.*
>
> *Those who worship the Buddhas through practice—in them recollection of Buddha is undefiled. Those in whom recollection of Buddha is undefiled—they ever see and contemplate the Buddhas.*
>
> *Those who ever see and contemplate the Buddhas—the Buddha never stands apart from them. Those from whom the Buddha never stands apart—the Dharma never departs from them.*
>
> *Those from whom the Dharma never departs—they are ever blessed by all the Victors.*

Thus is the endless elaboration of the root of faith spoken there. Having completed that [section], it concludes briefly:

> *Rare among ordinary sentient beings are those who have faith in such Dharmas. But those who have accumulated virtue and made merit—they have faith through the power of causes.*
>
> *One who might attend upon beings equal to the dust of ten fields¹¹ for a kalpa with all happiness—that merit is not as great as the merit of one who has faith in these Dharmas.*

## Additional Testimonies on Faith

### From Āryadadaśadharmasūtra¹²

> *Faith is the supreme vehicle by which the guides depart. Therefore the wise person should cultivate following faith.*
>
> *For one without faith, white dharmas do not grow—like green shoots from seeds burned by fire.*

### From Āryalalitavistarasūtra¹³

*"Ānanda, effort should be made in faith. This the Tathāgata declares."*

### From Siṃhaparipṛcchā¹⁴

*"Through faith, one avoids unfavorable moments."*

## Making Bodhicitta Firm

Thus, having made firm the root of faith, bodhicitta must be made firm, since it encompasses all merit. As stated in the Āryasiṃhaparipṛcchā, when the Blessed One was questioned by Prince Siṃha:

> **saṃgrahaḥ sarvadharmāṇāṃ karmaṇā kena jāyate |**
> **priyaśca bhoti sattvānāṃ yatra yatropapadyate ||**

*"By what action does the encompassing of all dharmas arise? And [how does one become] dear to beings wherever one is reborn?"*

The Blessed One said:

> **sarvasattvapramokṣāya cittaṃ bodhāya nāmayet |**
> **eṣa saṃgraha dharmāṇāṃ bhavate tena ca priyaḥ ||**

*"One should bend the mind toward awakening for the liberation of all beings. This is the encompassing of dharmas; thereby one becomes dear [to all]."*

## The Glories of Bodhicitta: Quotation from Gaṇḍavyūhasūtra

Likewise in the Āryagaṇḍavyūhasūtra it is described:

> *"Bodhicitta, son of good family, is the seed of all Buddha-dharmas. It is the field for the growth of white dharmas of all the world.¹⁵ It is the ground as refuge for all the world... It is like a father for the protection of all bodhisattvas.*
>
> *...It is like Vaiśravaṇa¹⁶ for cutting off all poverty. It is like the wish-fulfilling gem-king for accomplishing all purposes. It is like the auspicious pot¹⁷ for fulfilling all intentions. It is like a spear for conquering the enemy of afflictions. It is like Dharma for cutting off improper mental engagement.*
>
> *It is like a sword for severing the head of afflictions. It is like an axe for cutting the tree of suffering. It is like a weapon for protecting from all dangers. It is like a hook for drawing beings out of the waters of saṃsāra. It is like a whirlwind for scattering the grass of all obscurations and hindrances.*
>
> *It is like a summary for collecting all the vows and aspirations of bodhisattvas. It is like a caitya for the world with its gods, humans, and asuras.*
>
> *Thus, son of good family, bodhicitta is endowed with these and other immeasurable distinct qualities."*

## Soul-Check Hints for Blues Version

- The Ratnolkā quotation is a *chain of testimonies*—each line building on the last. Consider rendering as call-and-response or building rhythm.
- Faith here isn't blind belief—it's *trust grounded in experience*. Blues epistemology: "I believe because I've been there."
- The image of faith as "mother" and "guide" is powerful—maternal/ancestral wisdom
- Bodhicitta as "seed," "field," "sword," "axe"—rich metaphor territory
