# Chapter 14: Purification of the Person (Ātmabhāva-pariśuddhi)
## Śikṣāsamuccaya — Scholarly Translation by Dr. Rajesh Patel

---

**Summary**: Having established the applications of mindfulness (*smṛtyupasthāna*) in the previous chapter, Śāntideva now moves to the ontological ground of purification: the realization of emptiness (*śūnyatā*). This chapter analyzes the person (*ātmabhāva*) through the six elements (*dhātu*), proving they are devoid of intrinsic nature (*svabhāva*). It employs the classic metaphors of the dream, the illusion, and the banana tree to deconstruct the "Self" (*ātman*), thereby purifying the bodhisattva's engagement with the world.

### 1. The Root of Purification: Emptiness

The applications of mindfulness have been stated. Thus, with a mind yoked to yoga, one should descend into the **emptiness of all dharmas** (*sarvadharmaśūnyatā*) for the sake of lifting the remaining world from the ocean of suffering, for the sake of the method of awakening (*abhisaṃbodhyupāya*), and for the sake of mastery over all dharmas in the three times as boundless as the sky space.¹

For in this way, the emptiness of the person (*pudgalaśūnyatā*) becomes established. And from that, due to the cutting of the root, the defilements (*kleśāḥ*) do not arise.

As stated in the *Ārya-Tathāgataguhya Sūtra*:²

> "Just as, Śāntamati, when the root of a tree is cut, all the branches, leaves, and foliage wither—just so, Śāntamati, from the pacification of the view of the existing body (*satkāyadṛṣṭi*), all defilements are pacified."

### 2. The Praise of Emptiness

The benefits (*anuśaṃsā*) of cultivating emptiness are endless. As the *Candrapradīpa Sūtra* says:³

> "He who trains in this does not tremble at the Sugatas' teaching;
> That hero never goes under the sway of women.
> He finds joy in the teaching of the Sugatas—
> He who knows the self-nature of dharmas as thoroughly pacified.
>
> Not long from now, he will become a Lord of Two-Legged Beings (Buddha);
> He will become a physician, a doctor, a giver of happiness.
> He extracts the dart of suffering entirely from those in pain—
> He who knows the self-nature of dharmas as thoroughly pacified.
>
> That Moon of Men is risen by the power of patience;
> Struck by clods and sticks, he does not get angry.
> Even if cut limb from limb, he is not agitated—
> He who knows the self-nature of dharmas as thoroughly pacified."

### 3. Analysis of the Elements (Dhātuvibhāga)

Now, how are all dharmas selfless (*nirātmāna*)? How is there non-contradiction of the karma-result connection (*karmaphalasaṃbandha*) despite absence of intrinsic nature (*niḥsvabhāvatā*)?⁴

As demonstrated in the *Pitṛputrasamāgama Sūtra*:

> "This person (*puruṣa*), Great King, consists of **six elements** (*ṣaḍdhātu*), **six spheres of contact** (*ṣaṭsparśāyatana*), and **eighteen mental approaches** (*aṣṭādaśamanaupavicāra*).
>
> What are the six elements?
> 1. Earth element (*pṛthivīdhātu*)
> 2. Water element (*abdhātu*)
> 3. Fire element (*tejodhātu*)
> 4. Wind element (*vāyudhātu*)
> 5. Space element (*ākāśadhātu*)
> 6. Consciousness element (*vijñānadhātu*)

#### A. The Earth Element (Solidity)
> What is the internal earth element? Whatever in this body internally is hard, solid, organically appropriated (*upātta*). Hair, nails, teeth, etc.
>
> When the internal earth element arises, it does not come from anywhere. When it ceases, it does not go to any accumulation (*saṃnicaya*).
>
> Consider the embryo. From the union of sperm and blood (*śukra-śoṇita*), the *kalala* arises. But in that union, neither the man exists (inherently) nor the woman. The intention (*saṃkalpa*) arises from the unreal. That intention does not exist by own-nature. Just so, the solidity arises from conditions, but has no arrival or departure.
>
> **Ultimately, the earth element is empty of earth-element-ness.** It is not perceived except by convention (*vyavahāra*).

#### B. The Water Element (Cohesion)
> What is the internal water element? Tears, sweat, saliva, mucus, oil, lymph, marrow, fat, bile, phlegm, pus, blood, urine.
>
> When one sees a beloved, tears flow. From grief or from religious emotion (*dharmasaṃvega*), tears flow. But this water element does not come from anywhere. When the body dries up at death, it does not go anywhere.
>
> Even the great oceans at the end of the kalpa dry up completely. **Ultimately, the water element is empty of water-element-ness.**

#### C. The Fire Element (Maturation)
> What is the internal fire element? That by which the body is heated, digested, by which what is eaten and drunk gets cooked.
>
> It arises, yet comes from nowhere. It ceases, yet goes nowhere. It exists having not existed (*abhūtvā bhāva*), and having existed, it disappears. Why? Because it is devoid of own-nature (*svabhāvarahita*).

#### D. The Wind Element (Motion)
> What is the internal wind element? Upward winds, downward winds, winds in the limbs, breath.
>
> Just as a great storm arises, knocks down trees, and vanishes without a trace—so too the internal wind.

#### E. The Space Element (Opening)
> What is the internal space element? The eye-holes, the mouth, the throat, the gaps where food is swallowed.
>
> Just like a man digging a well in dry ground: where does the space come from? Nowhere. Where does it go when filled? Nowhere. **Space is empty of space-element-ness.** It is motionless, immutable (*avikāra*).

#### F. The Consciousness Element (Cognition)
> What is the consciousness element? The recognition (*prativijñapti*) of the object dependent on the eye, etc.
>
> This consciousness element does not rely on the sense-organ, does not come from the object, does not stay in between. It is not inside, not outside.
>
> **Ultimately, the consciousness element is empty of consciousness-element-ness.**

### 4. The Dream Metaphor (Svapnopama)

The senses are like an illusion (*māyopamā*). The objects are like a dream (*svapnopamā*).

> "Consider, Great King, a man sleeping. In a dream, he enjoys himself with a beautiful, charming woman (*janapadakalyāṇī*). Waking up, he remembers her.
>
> Does that woman exist in the dream? No.
> Is the man wise if he clings to her? No.
>
> Just so, the childish ordinary person (*bālapṛthagjana*) sees forms with the eye and clings to them. Clinging, he generates passion. Passionate, he creates karma.
>
> But that karma is exhausted from the start. It doesn't reside in the East, West, North, or South.
>
> At the moment of death, the final consciousness (*carama-vijñāna*) ceases. Dependent on that, the first consciousness (*prathama-vijñāna*) of the next life arises.
>
> **No dharma goes from this world to the next.** Yet death and rebirth appear to happen.
>
> The final consciousness is empty of final consciousness.
> The first consciousness is empty of first consciousness.
> **There is no agent (*kartā*) here, no experiencer (*bhoktā*), except by name-convention (*nāmasaṃketa*).**"

### 5. The Truth of Convention and Ultimate

Conventional truth (*saṃvṛti*) was taught by the Buddha for the sake of the world's benefit. Ultimate truth (*paramārtha*) is inexpressible, unknowable, unmanifest.

> "The Lion of Men taught convention
> Speaking of the six destinies (*gati*),
> Hell-beings, ghosts, gods, and men,
> But ultimately, no being (*sattva*) is found."

### 6. The Emptiness of the Agent

The *Druma-Kinnararāja-Paripṛcchā Sūtra* uses the chariot metaphor:⁵

> "Look at the assembly of chariot-parts (*śakaṭāṅga*),
> And look at the action of the chariot.
> Just as fire does not turn back from the tree moved by wind,
> So too the agents of karma.
>
> **The doer (*kartā*) is not found in the ten directions.**"

### 7. Purification Through Realization

Therefore, the Perfection of Wisdom (*Prajñāpāramitā*) is to be cultivated by one desiring purification of the mind.

As the *Saṃgīti Sūtra* says:

> "The proponent of emptiness (*śūnyatāvādin*) is not shaken by worldly dharmas.
> He is not delighted by gain, not depressed by loss.
> He doesn't stick to pleasure, doesn't clash with pain.
>
> He who is not shaken by worldly dharmas—he knows emptiness."

## Scholarly Notes

1.  **Traikālya**: The three times (past, present, future). Mastery here implies the *dhāraṇī*-power of the bodhisattva.
2.  **Cutting the Root**: A crucial metaphor. While *śamatha* (calm) suppresses defilements like placing a rock on grass, *vipaśyanā* (insight into emptiness) cuts the root so they cannot grow back.
3.  **Candrapradīpa Sūtra**: Also known as the *Samādhirāja Sūtra*. It emphasizes the soteriological power of the emptiness view—it's not just philosophy, it's the mechanism of liberation.
4.  **Karmaphalasaṃbandha**: The connection between action and result. The Madhyamaka challenge is always: "If things are empty, how does karma work?" The answer lies in the dream metaphor—karma functions *precisely because* it is empty (dependent arising), not static.
5.  **Chariot Metaphor**: The classic reductionist analysis. A chariot is neither its wheels, nor axle, nor the collection, nor separate from them. It is a designation (*prajñapti*). So too the Person.
